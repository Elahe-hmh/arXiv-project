hierarchy together with its algebraic orbit finite-field\nreductions is considered. The theory is illustrated by several significant\nexamples.\n", "  The general framework for integrable discrete systems on R in particular\ncontaining lattice soliton systems and their q-deformed analogues is presented.\nThe concept of regular grain structures on R, generated by discrete\none-parameter groups of diffeomorphisms, through which one can define algebras\nof shift operators is introduced. Two integrable hierarchies of discrete chains\ntogether with bi-Hamiltonian structures are constructed. Their continuous limit\nand the inverse problem based on the deformation quantization scheme are\nconsidered.\n", "  Nowadays, Cellular Neural Networks (CNN) are practically implemented in\nparallel, analog computers, showing a fast developing trend. Physicist must be\naware that such computers are appropriate for solving in an elegant manner\npractically important problems, which are extremely slow on the classical\ndigital architecture. Here, CNN is used for solving NP-hard optimization\nproblems on lattices. It is proved, that a CNN in which the parameters of all\ncells can be separately controlled, is the analog correspondent of a\ntwo-dimensional Ising type (Edwards-Anderson) spin-glass system. Using the\nproperties of CNN computers a fast optimization method can be built for such\nproblems. Estimating the simulation time needed for solving such NP-hard\noptimization problems on CNN based computers, and comparing it with the time\nneeded on normal digital computers using the simulated annealing algorithm, the\nresults are astonishing: CNN computers would be faster than digital computers\nalready at 10*10 lattice sizes. Hardwares realized nowadays are of 176*144\nsize. Also, there seems to be no technical difficulties adapting CNN chips for\nsuch problems and the needed local control is expected to be fully developed in\nthe near future.\n", "  A general unifying framework for integrable soliton-like systems on time\nscales is introduced. The $R$-matrix formalism is applied to the algebra of\n$\\delta$-differential operators in terms of which one can construct infinite\nhierarchy of commuting vector fields. The theory is illustrated by two\ninfinite-field integrable hierarchies on time scales which are difference\ncounterparts of KP and mKP. The difference counterparts of AKNS and Kaup-Broer\nsoliton systems are constructed as related finite-field restrictions.\n", "  We introduce the cotangent universal hierarchy that extends the so-called\nuniversal hierarchy (as for the latter, see e.g. arXiv:nlin/0202008,\narXiv:nlin/0312043 and arXiv:nlin/0310036). Then we construct a\n(2+1)-dimensional double central extension of the cotangent universal hierarchy\nand show that this extension is bi-Hamiltonian. This yields, as a byproduct,\nthe central extension of the original universal hierarchy.\n", "  A construction of the bi-Hamiltonian structures for integrable systems on\nregular time scales is presented. The trace functional on an algebra of\n$\\delta$-pseudo-differential operators, valid on an arbitrary regular time\nscale, is introduced. The linear Poisson tensors and the related Hamiltonians\nare derived. The quadratic Poisson tensors is given by the use of the recursion\noperators of the Lax hierarchies. The theory is illustrated by\n$\\Delta$-differential counterparts of Ablowitz-Kaup-Newell-Segur and Kaup-Broer\nhierarchies.\n", "  The R-matrix formalism for the construction of integrable systems with\ninfinitely many degrees of freedom is reviewed. Its application to Poisson,\nnoncommutative and loop algebras as well as central extension procedure are\npresented. The theory is developed for (1+1)-dimensional case where the space\nvariable belongs either to R or to various discrete sets. Then, the extension\nonto (2+1)-dimensional case is made, when the second space variable belongs to\nR. The formalism presented contains many proofs and important details to make\nit self-contained and complete. The general theory is applied to several\ninfinite dimensional Lie algebras in order to construct both dispersionless and\ndispersive (soliton) integrable field systems.\n", "  Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations of pure SU(2)xU(1) lattice gauge theory\nshow a (zero temperature) deconfining phase transition in the SU(2) gluon\nsector when a term is added to the SU(2) and U(1) Wilson actions, which\nrequires joint U(2) gauge transformations of the SU(2) and U(1) vector fields.\nInvestigations of this deconfined phase are of interest as it could provide an\nalternative to the Higgs mechanism.\n", "  We derive an index theorem for zero-energy Majorana fermion modes in a\nsuperconductor-topological insulator system in both two and three dimensions,\nwhich is valid for models with chiral symmetry as well as particle-hole\nsymmetry. For more generic models without chiral symmetry, we suggest that\nMajorana zero-modes are classified by Z$_2$.\n", "  We present numerical calculations of lamellar phases of block copolymers at\npatterned surfaces. We model symmetric di-block copolymer films forming\nlamellar phases and the effect of geometrical and chemical surface patterning\non the alignment and orientation of lamellar phases. The calculations are done\nwithin self-consistent field theory (SCFT), where the semi-implicit relaxation\nscheme is used to solve the diffusion equation. Two specific set-ups, motivated\nby recent experiments, are investigated. In the first, the film is placed on\ntop of a surface imprinted with long chemical stripes. The stripes interact\nmore favorably with one of the two blocks and induce a perpendicular\norientation in a large range of system parameters. However, the system is found\nto be sensitive to its initial conditions, and sometimes gets trapped into a\nmetastable mixed state composed of domains in parallel and perpendicular\norientations. In a second set-up, we study the film structure and orientation\nwhen it is pressed against a hard grooved mold. The mold surface prefers one of\nthe two components and this set-up is found to be superior for inducing a\nperfect perpendicular lamellar orientation for a wide range of system\nparameters.\n", "  We present NanoImprint lithography experiments and modeling of thin films of\nblock copolymers (BCP). The NanoImprint lithography is used to align\nperpendicularly lamellar phases, over distances much larger than the natural\nlamellar periodicity. The modeling relies on self-consistent field calculations\ndone in two- and three-dimensions. We get a good agreement with the NanoImprint\nlithography setups. We find that, at thermodynamical equilibrium, the ordered\nBCP lamellae are much better aligned than when the films are deposited on\nuniform planar surfaces.\n", "  This is the third part of our series \"Quasiclassical and Quantum Systems of\nAngular Momentum\". In two previous parts we have discussed the methods of group\nalgebras in formulation of quantum mechanics and certain quasiclassical\nproblems. Below we specify to the special case of the group ${\\rm SU}(2)$ and\nits quotient ${\\rm SO}(3,\\mathbb{R})$, and discuss just our main subject in\nthis series, i.e., angular momentum problems. To be more precise, this is the\npurely ${\\rm SU}(2)$-treatment, so formally this might also apply to isospin.\nHowever. it is rather hard to imagine realistic quasiclassical isospin\nproblems.\n", "  Ageing phenomena far from equilibrium naturally present dynamical scaling and\nin many situations this may generalised to local scale-invariance. Generically,\nthe absence of time-translation-invariance implies that each scaling operator\nis characterised by two independent scaling dimensions. Building on analogies\nwith logarithmic conformal invariance and logarithmic Schr\\\"odinger-invariance,\nthis work proposes a logarithmic extension of local scale-invariance, without\ntime-translation-invariance. Carrying this out requires in general to replace\nboth scaling dimensions of each scaling operator by Jordan cells. Co-variant\ntwo-point functions are derived for the most simple case of a two-dimensional\nlogarithmic extension. Their form is compared to simulational data for\nautoresponse functions in several universality classes of non-equilibrium\nageing phenomena.\n", "  In the present paper we investigate the mechanics of systems of\naffinely-rigid bodies, i.e., bodies rigid in the sense of affine geometry.\nCertain physical applications are possible in modelling of molecular crystals,\ngranular media, and other physical objects. Particularly interesting are\ndynamical models invariant under the group underlying geometry of degrees of\nfreedom. In contrary to the single body case there exist nontrivial potentials\ninvariant under this group (left and right acting). The concept of relative\n(mutual) deformation tensors of pairs of affine bodies is discussed. Scalar\ninvariants built of such tensors are constructed. There is an essential novelty\nin comparison to deformation scalars of single affine bodies, i.e., there exist\naffinely-invariant scalars of mutual deformations. Hence, the hierarchy of\ninteraction models according to their invariance group, from Euclidean to\naffine ones, can be considered.\n", "  The binding of clusters of metal nanoparticles is partly electrostatic. We\naddress difficulties in calculating the electrostatic energy when high charging\nenergies limit the total charge to a single quantum, entailing unequal\npotentials on the particles. We show that the energy at small separation $h$\nhas a strong logarithmic dependence on $h$. We give a general law for the\nstrength of this logarithmic correction in terms of a) the energy at contact\nignoring the charge quantization effects and b) an adjacency matrix specifying\nwhich spheres of the cluster are in contact and which is charged. We verify the\ntheory by comparing the predicted energies for a tetrahedral cluster with an\nexplicit numerical calculation.\n", "  In spite of its long history and classical character which goes back even to\nd'Alembert and Lagrange, the problems of constraints in mechanics of continua\nis still mysterious and full of misunderstandings. Let us mention the problem\nof difference between special solutions of unconstrained systems and\nconstraints dynamics, holonomic and nonholonomic constrained, various versions\nof so-called vakonomy, sub-Riemannian structures, servoconstraints, and\nprogramme motion. There are some strange confusions between field theory and\nmechanics of continua; many problems call for conceptual cleaning, although\nboth the mechanics of continua and field theory are formally based on partial\ndifferential equations. The author is deeply indebted to professor Czes\\law\nWo\\'{z}niak for his help during many years, and deep understanding and support.\n", "  The participants in this discussion session of the QCHS 9 meeting were each\nasked the following question: \"What would be the most useful piece of\ninformation that you could obtain, by whatever means, that would advance your\nown program, and/or our general understanding of confinement?\" This proceedings\ncontains a brief summary of each panel member's contribution to the discussion,\nprovided by the panel members themselves.\n", "  One of the goals of gravitational-wave astronomy is simultaneous detection of\ngravitational-wave signals from merging compact-object binaries and the\nelectromagnetic transients from these mergers. With the next generation of\nadvanced ground-based gravitational wave detectors under construction, we\nexamine the benefits of the proposed extension of the detector network to\ninclude a fourth site in Australia in addition to the network of Hanford,\nLivingston and Cascina sites. Using Bayesian parameter-estimation analyses of\nsimulated gravitational-wave signals from a range of coalescing-binary\nlocations and orientations, we study the improvement in parameter estimation.\nWe find that an Australian detector can break degeneracies in several\nparameters; in particular, the localization of the source on the sky is\nimproved by a factor of ~4, with more modest improvements in distance and\nbinary inclination estimates. This enhanced ability to localize sources on the\nsky will be crucial in any search for electromagnetic counterparts to detected\ngravitational-wave signals.\n", "  We investigate classical gravitational tests for the Kaluza-Klein model with\nspherical compactification of the internal two-dimensional space. In the case\nof the absence of a multidimensional bare cosmological constant, the only\nmatter which corresponds to the proposed metric ansatz is a perfect fluid with\nthe vacuum equation of state in the external space and the dust-like equation\nof state in the internal space. We perturb this background by a compact massive\nsource with the dust-like equation of state in both external and internal\nspaces (e.g., a point-like mass), and obtain the metric coefficients in the\nweak-field approximation. It enables to calculate the parameterized\npost-Newtonian parameter $\\gamma$. We demonstrate that $\\gamma=1/3$ which\nstrongly contradicts the observations.\n", "  We present a systematic study of photonic band gaps (PBGs) in\nthree-dimensional (3D) photonic amorphous structures (PAS) with short-range\norder. From calculations of the density of optical states (DOS) for PAS with\ndifferent topologies, we find that tetrahedrally connected dielectric networks\nproduce the largest isotropic PBGs. Local uniformity and tetrahedral order are\nessential to the formation of PBGs in PAS, in addition to short-range geometric\norder. This work demonstrates that it is possible to create broad, isotropic\nPBGs for vector light fields in 3D PAS without long-range order.\n", "  Strong gravitational lensing is a powerful tool for probing the matter\ndistribution in the cores of massive dark matter haloes. Recent and ongoing\nanalyses of galaxy cluster surveys (MACS, CFHTLS, SDSS, SGAS, CLASH, LoCuSS)\nhave adressed the question of the nature of the dark matter distribution in\nclusters. N-body simulations of cold dark-matter haloes consistently find that\nhaloes should be characterized by a concentration-mass relation that decreases\nmonotonically with halo mass, and populated by a large amount of substructures,\nrepresenting the cores of accreted progenitor halos. It is important for our\nunderstanding of dark matter to test these predictions. We present MOKA, a new\nalgorithm for simulating the gravitational lensing signal from cluster-sized\nhaloes. It implements the most recent results from numerical simulations to\ncreate realistic cluster-scale lenses with properties independent of numerical\nresolution. We perform systematic studies of the strong lensing cross section\nas a function of halo structures. We find that the strong lensing cross\nsections depend most strongly on the concentration and on the inner slope of\nthe density profile of a halo, followed in order of importance by halo\ntriaxiality and the presence of a bright central galaxy.\n", "  We study block copolymers (BCP) on patterned substrates, where the top\npolymer film surface is not constrained but is a free interface that adapts its\nshape self-consistently. In particular, we investigate the combined effect of\nthe free interface undulations with the wetting of the BCP film as induced by\nnano-patterned substrates. For a finite volume of BCP material, we find\nequilibrium droplets composed of coexisting perpendicular and parallel lamellar\ndomains. The self-assembly of BCP on topographic patterned substrates was also\ninvestigated and it was found that the free interface induces mixed\nmorphologies of parallel and perpendicular domains coupled with a non-flat free\ninterface. In both cases, the free interface relaxes the strong constraints\nthat would otherwise be imposed by a fixed top boundary (which is commonly used\nin simulations), and affects strongly the BCP ordering. Our study has some\ninteresting consequences for experimental setups of graphoepitaxy and\nnanoimprint lithography.\n", "  The proper general relativistic description of the observed galaxy power\nspectrum is substantially different from the standard Newtonian description on\nlarge scales, providing a unique opportunity to test general relativity on\nhorizon scales. Using the Einstein equations, the general relativistic effects\ncan be classified as two new terms that represent the velocity and the\ngravitational potential, coupling to the time evolution of galaxy number\ndensity and Hubble parameter. Compared to the dominant density and velocity\nredshift-space distortion terms, the former scales as H/k and correlates the\nreal and imaginary parts of the Fourier modes, while the latter scales as\n(H/k)^2, where k is the comoving wave number and H is the conformal Hubble\nparameter. We use the recently developed methods to reduce the sampling\nvariance and shot noise to show that in an all sky galaxy redshift survey at\nlow redshift the velocity term can be measured at 10-sigma confidence level, if\none can utilize halos of mass M>10^{10} Msun, while the gravitational potential\nterm itself can only be marginally detected. We also demonstrate that the\ngeneral relativistic effect is not degenerate with the primordial non-Gaussian\nsignature in galaxy bias, and the ability to detect the primordial\nnon-Gaussianity is little compromised.\n", "  We present a numerical study on photonic bandgap and bandedge modes in the\ngolden-angle spiral array of air cylinders in dielectric media. Despite the\nlack of long-range translational and rotational order, there is a large PBG for\nthe TE polarized light. Due to spatial inhomogeneity in the air hole spacing,\nthe bandedge modes are spatially localized by Bragg scattering from the\nparastichies in the spiral structure. They have discrete angular momenta that\noriginate from different families of the parastichies whose numbers correspond\nto the Fibonacci numbers. The unique structural characteristics of the\ngolden-angle spiral lead to distinctive features of the bandedge modes that are\nabsent in both photonic crystals and quasicrystals.\n", "  Recently, it has been proposed that the S-matrix elements on the world volume\nof an abelian D$_3$-brane are consistent with the Ward identity associated with\nthe S-duality. In this paper we extend this study to the case of multiple\nD$_3$-branes. We speculate that the S-matrix elements are consistent with the\nS-dual Ward identity irrespective of the ordering of the external states.\nImposing this symmetry on the particular case of the S-matrix element of one\nKalb-Ramond, one transverse scalar and two nonabelian gauge bosons, we will\nfind the linear S-duality transformation of the commutator of two nonabelian\ngauge field strengths. Using this transformation and the standard S-duality\ntransformations of the supergravity fields, all other nonabelian S-matrix\nelements of one closed and three open string states can be found by the\nS-duality proposal. We will show that the predicted S-matrix elements are\nreproduced exactly by explicit calculations.\n", "  Using the two-component model that includes both initial production from\nnucleon-nucleon hard scattering and regeneration from produced quark-gluon\nplasma (QGP), we study the effect of medium modifications of the binding\nenergies and radii of bottomonia on their production in heavy-ion collisions.\nWe find that the contribution to bottomonia production from regeneration is\nsmall and the inclusion of medium effects is generally helpful for\nunderstanding the observed suppression of bottomonia production in experiments\ncarried out at both the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the Large\nHadron Collider (LHC).\n", "  We construct an environmentally selected supersymmetric standard model with a\nsingle Higgs doublet, in analogy with the work of Hall and Nomura. The low\nenergy spectrum presents only the standard model states with a single Higgs and\nTeV scale gauginos. The model features a precise Higgs mass prediction\nm_H=141\\pm 2 GeV and the neutral wino provides a viable dark matter candidate.\n", "  A very natural construction of integrable extensions of soliton systems is\npresented. The extension is made on the level of evolution equations by a\nmodification of the algebra of dynamical fields. The paper is motivated by\nrecent works of Wen-Xiu Ma et al. (Comp. Math. Appl. 60 (2010) 2601, Appl.\nMath. Comp. 217 (2011) 7238), where new class of soliton systems, being\nnonlinear integrable couplings, was introduced. The general form of solutions\nof the considered class of coupled systems is described. Moreover, the\ndecoupling procedure is derived, which is also applicable to several other\ncoupling systems from the literature.\n", "  Finding affordable ways of generating high-density ordered nanostructures\nthat can be transferred to a substrate is a major challenge for industrial\napplications like memories or optical devices with high resolution features. In\nthis work, we report on a novel technique to direct self-assembled structures\nof block copolymers by NanoImprint Lithography. Surface energy of a reusable\nmold and nanorheology are used to organize the copolymers in defect-free\nstructures over tens of micrometers in size. Versatile and controlled in-plane\norientations of about 25 nm half-period lamellar nanostructures are achieved\nand, in particular, include applications to circular tracks of magnetic reading\nheads.\n", "  The theory for the formation of the first population of stars (Pop III)\npredicts an initial mass function (IMF) dominated by high-mass stars, in\ncontrast to the present-day IMF, which tends to yield mostly stars with masses\nless than 1 M_Sol. The leading theory for the transition in the characteristic\nstellar mass predicts that the cause is the extra cooling provided by\nincreasing metallicity. In particular, dust can overtake H_2 as the leading\ncoolant at very high densities. The aim of this work is to determine the\ninfluence of dust cooling on the fragmentation of very low metallicity gas. To\ninvestigate this, we make use of high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations with\nsink particles to replace contracting protostars, and analyze the collapse and\nfurther fragmentation of star-forming clouds. We follow the thermodynamic\nresponse of the gas by solving the full thermal energy equation, and also track\nthe behavior of the dust temperature and the chemical evolution of the gas. We\nmodel four clouds with different metallicities (10^{-4}, 10^{-5}, 10^{-6}\nZ_Sol, and 0), and determine the properties of each cloud at the point at which\nit undergoes gravitational fragmentation. We find evidence for fragmentation in\nall four cases, and hence conclude that there is no critical metallicity below\nwhich fragmentation is impossible. Nevertheless, there is a clear change in the\nbehavior of the clouds at Z = 10^{-5} Z_Sol, caused by the fact that at this\nmetallicity, fragmentation takes longer to occur than accretion, leading to a\nflat mass function at lower metallicities.\n", "  For noninteracting particles moving in a Gaussian random potential, there\nexists a disagreement in the literature on the asymptotic expression for the\ndensity of states in the tail of the band. We resolve this discrepancy. Further\nwe illuminate the physical facet of instantons appearing in replica and\nsupersymmetric derivations with another derivation employing a Lagrange\nmultiplier field.\n", "  We study the physical conditions of the circum-galactic medium (CGM) around\nz=0.25 galaxies as traced by HI and metal line absorption, using cosmological\nhydrodynamic simulations that include galactic outflows. Using lines of sight\ntargeted at impact parameters from 10 kpc to 1 Mpc around galaxies with halo\nmasses from 10^11-10^13 M_solar, we study the physical conditions and their\nvariation with impact parameter b and line-of-sight velocity delta v in the CGM\nas traced by HI, MgII, SiIV, CIV, OVI, and NeVIII absorbers. All ions show a\nstrong excess of absorption near galaxies compared to random lines of sight.\nThe excess continues beyond 1 Mpc, reflecting the correlation of metal\nabsorption with large-scale structure. Absorption is particularly enhanced\nwithin about v<300 km/sec and roughly 300 kpc of galaxies (with distances\nsomewhat larger for the highest ion), approximately delineating the CGM; this\nrange contains the majority of global metal absorption. Low ions like MgII and\nSiIV predominantly arise in denser gas closer to galaxies and drop more rapidly\nwith b, while high ions OVI and NeVIII trace more diffusely distributed gas\nwith a comparatively flat radial profile; CIV is intermediate. All ions\npredominantly trace T~10^4-4.5 K photo-ionised gas at all b, but when hot CGM\ngas is present (mostly in larger halos), we see strong collisionally-ionised\nOVI and NeVIII at b <= 100 kpc. Larger halo masses generally produce more\nabsorption, though overall the trends are not as strong as that with impact\nparameter. These findings arise using our favoured outflow scalings as expected\nfor momentum-driven winds; with no winds, the CGM gas remains mostly\nunenriched, while our outflow model with a constant velocity and mass loading\nfactor produce hotter, more widely dispersed metals.\n", "  Under optical excitation, coupled quantum wells are known to reveal\nfascinating features in the photoluminescence pattern originating from dipole\norientated indirect excitons. The appearance of an external ring has been\nattributed to macroscopic charge separation in the quantum well plane. We\npresent a classical model of non-linear diffusion to account for the observed\nfragmentation of the external ring into a periodic array of islands. The model\nincorporates the Coulomb interactions between electrons, holes and indirect\nexcitons. At low temperatures, these interactions lead to pattern formation\nsimilar to the experimentally observed ring fragmentation. The fragmentation is\nfound to persist to temperatures above the quantum degeneracy temperature of\nindirect excitons.\n", "  We introduce a stable and efficient complex Langevin (CL) scheme to enable\nthe first numerical simulations of the coherent-states (CS) formulation of\npolymer field theory. In contrast with Edwards' well known auxiliary-field (AF)\nframework, the CS formulation does not contain an embedded non-linear,\nnon-local functional of the auxiliary fields, and the action of the field\ntheory has a fully explicit, finite-order and semi-local polynomial character.\nIn the context of a polymer solution model, we demonstrate that the new CS-CL\ndynamical scheme for sampling fluctuations in the space of coherent states\nyields results in good agreement with now-standard AF simulations. The\nformalism is potentially applicable to a broad range of polymer architectures\nand may facilitate systematic generation of trial actions for use in\ncoarse-graining and numerical renormalization-group studies.\n", "  The aim of this paper is to perform a deeper geometric analysis of problems\nappearing in dynamics of affinely rigid bodies. First of all we present a\ngeometric interpretation of the polar and two-polar decomposition of affine\nmotion. Later on some additional constraints imposed on the affine motion are\nreviewed, both holonomic and non-holonomic. In particular, we concentrate on\ncertain natural non-holonomic models of the rotation-less motion. We discuss\nboth the usual d'Alembert model and the vakonomic dynamics. The resulting\nequations are quite different. It is not yet clear which model is practically\nbetter. In any case they both are different from the holonomic constraints\ndefining the rotation-less motion as a time-dependent family of symmetric\nmatrices of placements. The latter model seems to be non-geometric and\nnon-physical. Nevertheless, there are certain relationships between our\nnon-holonomic models and the polar decomposition.\n", "  It is well known that there are various models of gravitation: the metrical\nHilbert-Einstein theory, a wide class of intrinsically Lorentz-invariant tetrad\ntheories (of course, generally-covariant in the space-time sense), and many\ngauge models based on various internal symmetry groups (Lorentz, Poincare,\n${\\rm GL}(n,\\mathbb{R})$, ${\\rm SU}(2,2)$, ${\\rm GL}(4,\\mathbb{C})$, and so\non). One believes usually in gauge models and we also do it. Nevertheless, it\nis an interesting idea to develop the class of ${\\rm\nGL}(4,\\mathbb{R})$-invariant (or rather ${\\rm GL}(n,\\mathbb{R})$-invariant)\ntetrad ($n$-leg) generally covariant models. This is done below and motivated\nby our idea of bringing back to life the Thales of Miletus idea of affine\nsymmetry. Formally, the obtained scheme is a generally-covariant tetrad\n($n$-leg) model, but it turns out that generally-covariant and intrinsically\naffinely-invariant models must have a kind of non-accidental Born-Infeld-like\nstructure. Let us also mention that they, being based on tetrads ($n$-legs),\nhave many features common with continuous defect theories. It is interesting\nthat they possess some group-theoretical solutions and more general\nspherically-symmetric solutions. It is also interesting that within such\nframework the normal-hyperbolic signature of the space-time metric is not\nintroduced by hand, but appears as a kind of solution, rather integration\nconstants, of differential equations. Let us mention that our Born-Infeld\nscheme is more general than alternative tetrad models. It may be also used\nwithin more general schemes, including also the gauge ones.\n", "  A general scheme for construction of flat pencils of contravariant metrics\nand Frobenius manifolds as well as related solutions to WDVV associativity\nequations is formulated. The advantage is taken from the Rota-Baxter identity\nand some relation being counterpart of the modified Yang-Baxter identity from\nthe classical $r$-matrix formalism. The scheme for the construction of\nFrobenius manifolds is illustrated on the algebras of formal Laurent series and\nmeromorphic functions on Riemann sphere.\n", "  The St\\\"ackel separability of a Hamiltonian system is well known to ensure\nexistence of a complete set of Poisson commuting integrals of motion quadratic\nin the momenta. In the present paper we consider a class of St\\\"ackel separable\nsystems where the entries of the St\\\"ackel matrix are monomials in the\nseparation variables. We show that the only systems in this class for which the\nintegrals of motion arising from the St\\\"ackel construction keep commuting\nafter quantization are, up to natural equivalence transformations, the\nso-called Benenti systems. Moreover, it turns out that the latter are the only\nquantum separable systems (that is, they admit separation of variables in the\nSchr\\\"odinger equation) in the class under study.\n", "  A recent paper (2012 \\emph{J. Phys.\\ A} \\textbf{45} 374018) is extended by\ninvestigating the behavior of the regularized quantum scalar stress tensor near\nthe axes of cones and their covering manifold, the Dowker space. A cone is\nparametrized by its angle $\\theta_1$, where $\\theta_1=2\\pi$ for flat space. We\nfind that the tensor components have singularities of the type $r^\\gamma$, but\nthe generic leading $\\gamma$ equals ${4\\pi \\over \\theta_1} - 2$, which is\nnegative if and only if $\\theta_1>2\\pi$, and is a positive integer if\n$\\theta_1={2\\pi\\over N}$. Thus the functions are analytic in those cases that\ncan be solved by the method of images starting from flat space, and they are\nnot divergent in the cases that interpolate between those. As a wedge of angle\n$\\alpha$ can be solved by images starting from a cone of angle $2\\alpha$, a\ndivergent stress can arise in a wedge with $\\pi <\\alpha \\le 2\\pi$ but not in a\nsmaller one.\n", "  A class of multi-component integrable systems associated to Novikov algebras,\nwhich interpolate between KdV and Camassa-Holm type equations, is obtained. The\nconstruction is based on the classification of low-dimensional Novikov algebras\nby Bai and Meng. These multi-component bi-Hamiltonian systems obtained by this\nconstruction may be interpreted as Euler equations on the centrally extended\nLie algebras associated to the Novikov algebras. The related bilinear forms\ngenerating cocycles of first, second and third order are classified. Several\nexamples, including known integrable equations, are presented.\n", "  To be observed and analyzed by the network of gravitational wave detectors on\nground (LIGO, VIRGO, etc.) and by the future detectors in space (LISA, etc.),\ninspiralling compact binaries --- binary star systems composed of neutron stars\nand/or black holes in their late stage of evolution --- require high-accuracy\ntemplates predicted by general relativity theory. The gravitational waves\nemitted by these very relativistic systems can be accurately modelled using a\nhigh-order post-Newtonian gravitational wave generation formalism. In this\narticle, we present the current state of the art on post-Newtonian methods as\napplied to the dynamics and gravitational radiation of general matter sources\n(including the radiation reaction back onto the source) and inspiralling\ncompact binaries. We describe the post-Newtonian equations of motion, in\nLagrangian and Hamiltonian formalisms, pay attention to the self-field\nregularizations at work, discuss several notions of innermost circular orbits\nand make comparisons with numerical gravitational self-force computations. The\ngravitational waveform and energy flux are obtained with high post-Newtonian\nprecision. Some landmark results are discussed in the case of eccentric compact\nbinaries moving on quasi-elliptical orbits, and on spin-orbit coupling effects\nin black hole binaries.\n", "  We propose the complex-plane generalization of a powerful algebraic sequence\nacceleration algorithm, the Method of Weighted Averages (MWA), to guarantee\nexponential-cum-algebraic convergence of Fourier and Fourier-Hankel (F-H)\nintegral transforms. This \"complex-plane\" MWA, effected via a linear-path\ndetour in the complex plane, results in rapid, absolute convergence of\nfield/potential solutions in multi-layered environments regardless of the\nsource-observer geometry and anisotropy/loss of the media present. In this\nwork, we first introduce a new integration path used to evaluate the field\ncontribution arising from the radiation spectra. Subsequently, we (1) exhibit\nthe foundational relations behind the complex-plane extension to a general\nLevin-type sequence convergence accelerator, (2) specialize this analysis to\none member of the Levin transform family (the MWA), (3) address and circumvent\nrestrictions, arising for two-dimensional integrals associated with wave\ndynamics problems, through minimal complex-plane detour restrictions and a\nnovel partition of the integration domain, (4) develop and compare two\nformulations based on standard/real-axis MWA variants, and (5) present\nvalidation results and convergence characteristics for one of these two\nformulations.\n", "  While the absorption of light is ubiquitous in nature and in applications,\nthe question remains how absorption modifies the transmission channels in\nrandom media. We present a numerical study on the effects of optical absorption\non the maximal transmission and minimal reflection channels in a\ntwo-dimensional disordered waveguide. In the weak absorption regime, where the\nsystem length is less than the diffusive absorption length, the maximal\ntransmission channel is dominated by diffusive transport and it is equivalent\nto the minimal reflection channel. Its frequency bandwidth is determined by the\nunderlying quasimode width. However, when the absorption is strong, light\ntransport in the maximal transmission channel undergoes a sharp transition and\nbecomes ballistic-like transport. Its frequency bandwidth increases with\nabsorption, and the exact scaling varies with the sample's realization. The\nminimal reflection channel becomes different from the maximal transmission\nchannel and becomes dominated by absorption. Counterintuitively, we observe in\nsome samples that the minimum reflection eigenvalue increases with absorption.\nOur results show that strong absorption turns open channels in random media\nfrom diffusive to ballistic-like.\n", "  The study of complex social and political phenomena with the perspective and\nmethods of network science has proven fruitful in a variety of areas, including\napplications in political science and more narrowly the field of international\nrelations. We propose a new line of research in the study of international\nconflict by showing that the multiplex fractionalization of the international\nsystem (which we label Kantian fractionalization) is a powerful predictor of\nthe propensity for violent interstate conflict, a key indicator of the system's\nstability. In so doing, we also demonstrate the first use of multislice\nmodularity for community detection in a multiplex network application. Even\nafter controlling for established system-level conflict indicators, we find\nthat Kantian fractionalization contributes more to model fit for violent\ninterstate conflict than previously established measures. Moreover, evaluating\nthe influence of each of the constituent networks shows that joint democracy\nplays little, if any, role in predicting system stability, thus challenging a\nmajor empirical finding of the international relations literature. Lastly, a\nseries of Granger causal tests shows that the temporal variability of Kantian\nfractionalization is consistent with a causal relationship with the prevalence\nof conflict in the international system. This causal relationship has\nreal-world policy implications as changes in Kantian fractionalization could\nserve as an early warning sign of international instability.\n", "  We use high-quality, medium-resolution {\\it Hubble Space Telescope}/Cosmic\nOrigins Spectrograph (\\HST/COS) observations of 82 UV-bright AGN at redshifts\n$z_{AGN}<0.85$ to construct the largest survey of the low-redshift\nintergalactic medium (IGM) to date: 5343 individual extragalactic absorption\nlines in HI and 25 different metal-ion species grouped into 2610 distinct\nredshift systems at $z_{abs}<0.75$ covering total redshift pathlengths $\\Delta\nz_{HI}=21.7$ and $\\Delta z_{OVI}=14.5$. Our semi-automated line-finding and\nmeasurement technique renders the catalog as objectively-defined as possible.\nThe cumulative column-density distribution of HI systems can be parametrized\n$dN(>N)/dz=C_{14}(N/10^{14} cm^{-2})^{-(\\beta-1)}$, with $C_{14}=25\\pm1$ and\n$\\beta=1.65\\pm0.02$. This distribution is seen to evolve both in amplitude,\n$C_{14}\\sim(1+z)^{2.0\\pm0.1}$, and slope $\\beta(z)=1.73-0.26 z$ for $z<0.47$.\nWe observe metal lines in 427 systems, and find that the fraction of IGM\nabsorbers detected in metals is strongly dependent on N_{HI}. The distribution\nof OVI absorbers appear to evolve in the same sense as the Lya forest. We\ncalculate contributions to $\\Omega_b$ from different components of the low-$z$\nIGM and determine the Lya decrement as a function of redshift. IGM absorbers\nare analyzed via a two-point correlation function (TPCF) in velocity space. We\nfind substantial clustering of \\HI\\ absorbers on scales of $\\Delta v=50-300$\nkm/s with no significant clustering at $\\Delta v>1000$ km/s. Splitting the\nsample into strong and weak absorbers, we see that most of the clustering\noccurs in strong, $N_{HI}>10^{13.5} cm^{-2}$, metal-bearing IGM systems. The\nfull catalog of absorption lines and fully-reduced spectra is available via\nMAST as a high-level science product at http://archive.stsci.edu/prepds/igm/.\n", "  The design of stacks of layered materials in which adjacent layers interact\nby van der Waals forces[1] has enabled the combination of various\ntwo-dimensional crystals with different electrical, optical and mechanical\nproperties, and the emergence of novel physical phenomena and device\nfunctionality[2-8]. Here we report photo-induced doping in van der Waals\nheterostructures (VDHs) consisting of graphene and boron nitride layers. It\nenables flexible and repeatable writing and erasing of charge doping in\ngraphene with visible light. We demonstrate that this photo-induced doping\nmaintains the high carrier mobility of the graphene-boron nitride (G/BN)\nheterostructure, which resembles the modulation doping technique used in\nsemiconductor heterojunctions, and can be used to generate spatially-varying\ndoping profiles such as p-n junctions. We show that this photo-induced doping\narises from microscopically coupled optical and electrical responses of G/BN\nheterostructures, which includes optical excitation of defect transitions in\nboron nitride, electrical transport in graphene, and charge transfer between\nboron nitride and graphene.\n", "  The French-German Research Institute (ISL) has several railguns installed,\nthe largest of these is the PEGASUS accelerator. It is a 6m long, 4x4 cm2\ncaliber distributed energy supply (DES) railgun. It has a 10 MJ capacitor bank\nas energy supply attached to it. In the past, this installation was used to\naccelerate projectiles with a mass of about 300 g to velocities up to 2500 m/s.\nIn the ongoing investigation, it is attempted to accelerate heavier projectiles\nto velocities above 2000m/s. For this a new type of projectile including a\npayload section was developed. In this paper the results of the experiments\nwith payload projectiles using a primary energy between 3.8 MJ and 4.8 MJ are\ndiscussed.\n", "  We study four-dimensional quantum gravity using non-perturbative\nrenormalization group methods. We solve the corresponding equations for the\nfully momentum-dependent propagator, Newton's coupling and the cosmological\nconstant. For the first time, we obtain a global phase diagram where the\nnon-Gaussian ultraviolet fixed point of asymptotic safety is connected via\nsmooth trajectories to a classical infrared fixed point. The theory is\ntherefore ultraviolet complete and deforms smoothly into classical gravity as\nthe infrared limit is approached.\n", "  We show global well-posedness in energy norm of the semi-relativistic\nSchr\\\"odinger-Poisson system of equations with attractive Coulomb interaction\nin ${\\mathbb R}^3$ in the presence of pseudo-relativistic diffusion. We also\ndiscuss sufficient conditions to have well-posedness in ${\\mathcal L}^2$. In\nthe absence of dissipation, we show that the solution corresponding to an\ninitial condition with negative energy blows up in finite time, which is as\nexpected, since the nonlinearity is critical.\n", "  We present a comprehensive structural study on perovskite-type 6H-Ba3CuSb2O9,\nwhich exhibits a spin-orbital short-range ordering on a honeycomb-based\nlattice. By combining synchrotron x-ray diffraction, electron spin resonance,\nultrasound measurement and Raman spectroscopy, we found that the static\nJahn-Teller distortion is absent down to the lowest temperature in the present\nmaterial, indicating orbital ordering is strongly suppressed. We discuss such\nan unusual state is realized with the help of spin degree of freedom, leading\nto a spin-orbital entangled liquid state.\n", "  We discuss the application of Complex-Plane Gauss-Laguerre Quadrature (CGLQ)\nto efficiently evaluate two-dimensional Fourier integrals arising as the\nsolution to electromagnetic fields radiated by elementary dipole antennas\nembedded within planar-layered media with arbitrary material parameters. More\nspecifically, we apply CGLQ to the long-standing problem of rapidly and\nefficiently evaluating the semi-infinite length \"tails\" of the Fourier integral\npath while simultaneously and robustly guaranteeing absolute, exponential\nconvergence of the field solution despite diversity in the doubly anisotropic\nlayer parameters, source type (i.e., electric or equivalent magnetic dipole),\nsource orientation, observed field type (magnetic or electric), (non-zero)\nfrequency, and (non-zero) source-observer separation geometry. The proposed\nalgorithm exhibits robustness despite unique challenges arising for the fast\nevaluation of such two-dimensional integrals. Herein, we develop the\nmathematical treatment to rigorously evaluate the tail integrals using CGLQ and\ndiscuss and address the specific issues posed to the CGLQ method when\nanisotropic, layered media are present. To empirically demonstrate the CGLQ\nalgorithm's computational efficiency, versatility, and accuracy, we perform a\nconvergence analysis along with two case studies related to modeling of\nelectromagnetic resistivity tools employed in geophysical prospection of\nlayered, anisotropic Earth media and validating the ability of isoimpedance\nsubstrates to enhance the radiation performance of planar antennas placed in\nclose proximity to metallic ground planes.\n", "  We discuss the numerically stable, spectral-domain computation and extraction\nof the scattered electromagnetic field excited by distributed sources embedded\nin planar-layered environments, where each layer may exhibit arbitrary and\nindependent electrical and magnetic anisotropic response and loss profiles.\nThis stands in contrast to many standard spectral-domain algorithms that are\nrestricted to computing the fields radiated by Hertzian dipole sources in\nplanar-layered environments where the media possess azimuthal-symmetric\nmaterial tensors (i.e., isotropic, and certain classes of uniaxial, media).\nAlthough computing the scattered field, particularly when due to distributed\nsources, appears (from the analytical perspective, at least) relatively\nstraightforward, different procedures within the computation chain, if not\ntreated carefully, are inherently susceptible to numerical instabilities and\n(or) accuracy limitations due to the potential manifestation of numerically\noverflown and (or) numerically unbalanced terms entering the chain. Therefore,\nprimary emphasis herein is given to effecting these tasks in a numerically\nstable and robust manner for all ranges of physical parameters. After\ndiscussing the causes behind, and means to mitigate, these sources of numerical\ninstability, we validate the algorithm's performance against closed-form\nsolutions. Finally, we validate and illustrate the applicability of the\nproposed algorithm in case studies concerning active remote sensing of marine\nhydrocarbon reserves embedded deep within lossy, planar-layered media.\n", "  Community detection in online social networks is typically based on the\nanalysis of the explicit connections between users, such as \"friends\" on\nFacebook and \"followers\" on Twitter. But online users often have hundreds or\neven thousands of such connections, and many of these connections do not\ncorrespond to real friendships or more generally to accounts that users\ninteract with. We claim that community detection in online social networks\nshould be question-oriented and rely on additional information beyond the\nsimple structure of the network. The concept of 'community' is very general,\nand different questions such as \"whom do we interact with?\" and \"with whom do\nwe share similar interests?\" can lead to the discovery of different social\ngroups. In this paper we focus on three types of communities beyond structural\ncommunities: activity-based, topic-based, and interaction-based. We analyze a\nTwitter dataset using three different weightings of the structural network\nmeant to highlight these three community types, and then infer the communities\nassociated with these weightings. We show that the communities obtained in the\nthree weighted cases are highly different from each other, and from the\ncommunities obtained by considering only the unweighted structural network. Our\nresults confirm that asking a precise question is an unavoidable first step in\ncommunity detection in online social networks, and that different questions can\nlead to different insights about the network under study.\n", "  We present a quantum algorithm for approximating the linear structures of a\nBoolean function $f$. Different from previous algorithms (such as Simon's and\nShor's algorithms) which rely on restrictions on the Boolean function, our\nalgorithm applies to every Boolean function with no promise. Here, our methods\nare based on the result of the Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm which is to\nidentify linear Boolean functions and the idea of Simon's period-finding\nalgorithm. More precisely, how the extent of approximation changes over the\ntime is obtained, and meanwhile we also get some quasi linear structures if\nthere exists. Next, we obtain that the running time of the quantum algorithm to\nthoroughly determine this question is related to the relative differential\nuniformity $\\delta_f$ of $f$. Roughly speaking, the smaller the $\\delta_f$ is,\nthe less time will be needed.\n", "  Motivated by the separability problem in quantum systems $2\\otimes4$,\n$3\\otimes3$ and $2\\otimes2\\otimes2$, we study the maximal (proper) faces of the\nconvex body, $S_1$, of normalized separable states in an arbitrary quantum\nsystem with finite-dimensional Hilbert space $H=H_1\\otimes\nH_2\\otimes\\cdots\\otimes H_n$. To any subspace $V$ of $H$ we associate a face\n$F_V$ of $S_1$ consisting of all states $\\rho\\in S_1$ whose range is contained\nin $V$. We prove that $F_V$ is a maximal face if and only if $V$ is a\nhyperplane. If $V$ is the hyperplane orthogonal to a product vector, we prove\nthat $\\dim F_V=d^2-1-\\prod(2d_i-1)$, where $d_i$ is the dimension of $H_i$ and\n$d=\\prod d_i$. We classify the maximal faces of $S_1$ in the cases $2\\otimes2$\nand $2\\otimes3$. In particular we show that the minimum and the maximum\ndimension of maximal faces is 6 and 8 for $2\\otimes2$, and 20 and 24 for\n$2\\otimes3$. The boundary of $S_1$ is the union of all maximal faces. When\n$d>6$ we prove that there exist full states $\\rho$ on the boundary, i.e., such\nthat all partial transposes of $\\rho$ (including $\\rho$ itself) have rank $d$.\nK.-C. Ha and S.-K. Kye have recently constructed explicit such states in\n$2\\times4$ and $3\\otimes3$. In the latter case, they have also constructed a\nremarkable family of faces, depending on a real parameter $b>0$, $b\\ne1$. Each\nface in the family is a 9-dimensional simplex and any interior point of the\nface is a full state. We construct suitable optimal entanglement witnesses\n(OEW) for these faces and analyze the three limiting cases $b=0,1,\\infty$.\n", "  Nanomagnetic implementations of Boolean logic [1,2] have garnered attention\nbecause of their non-volatility and the potential for unprecedented\nenergy-efficiency. Unfortunately, the large dissipative losses that take place\nwhen nanomagnets are switched with a magnetic field [3], or\nspin-transfer-torque [4] inhibit the promised energy-efficiency. Recently,\nthere have been experimental reports of utilizing the Spin Hall effect for\nswitching magnets [5-7], and theoretical proposals for strain induced switching\nof single-domain magnetostrictive nanomagnets [8-12], that might reduce the\ndissipative losses significantly. Here, we demonstrate, for the first time,\nthat strain-induced switching of single-domain magnetostrictive nanomagnets of\nlateral dimensions ~200 nm fabricated on a piezoelectric substrate can\nimplement a nanomagnetic Boolean NOT gate and unidirectional bit information\npropagation in dipole-coupled nanomagnets chains. This portends\nultra-low-energy logic processors and mobile electronics that may be able to\noperate solely by harvesting energy from the environment without ever requiring\na battery.\n", "  For oblique anti-plane shear waves in periodic layered elastic composites, it\nis shown that negative energy refraction is accompanied by positive\nphase-velocity refraction and positive energy refraction is accompanied by\nnegative phase-velocity refraction, and that, this happens over a broad range\nof frequencies. The composite's unit cell may consist of any number of layers\nof any variable mass-density and elastic shear modulus (with large\ndiscontinuities).\n  Explicit series expressions for displacement, velocity, strain and stress\ncomponents, and energy-flux fields are given, and group-velocity vector is\ncalculated. The approach is based on a mixed variational principle where the\ndisplacement and stress components are viewed as independent fields subject to\narbitrary variation. These fields are hence approximated independently, thereby\nensuring the necessary continuity conditions. The resulting computational\nmethod yields the composite's frequency band structure and the associated mode\nshapes, in terms of the wave-vector components for any desired number of\nfrequency bands.\n  The general results are illustrated using a two-phase and a three-phase unit\ncell with piecewise constant properties. It is shown that on their second\nfrequency pass-bands, only the components of the phase and group velocities\nnormal to the layers are antiparallel, while the components along the layers\nare parallel. Therefore, both the two-phase and the three-phase composites\ndisplay negative energy refraction with positive phase-velocity refraction and\npositive phase-velocity refraction with negative energy refraction, depending\non how the composite is interfaced with a homogeneous solid.\n  The presented method is applicable and effective also when some or all of the\nlayers in a unit cell have spatially varying properties.\n", "  We demonstrate lasing mode selection in nearly circular semiconductor\nmicrodisks by shaping the spatial profile of optical pump. Despite of strong\nmode overlap, adaptive pumping suppresses all lasing modes except the targeted\none. Due to slight deformation of the cavity shape and boundary roughness, each\nlasing mode has distinct emission pattern. By selecting different mode to be\nthe dominant lasing mode, we can switch both the lasing frequency and the\noutput direction. Such tunability by external pump after the laser is\nfabricated enhances the functionality of semiconductor microcavity lasers.\n", "  We study the relation between the maximal violation of Svetlichny's\ninequality and the mixedness of quantum states and obtain the optimal state\n(i.e., maximally nonlocal mixed states, or MNMS, for each value of linear\nentropy) to beat the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt and the Svetlichny games. For\nthe two-qubit and three-qubit MNMS, we showed that these states are also the\nmost tolerant state against white noise, and thus serve as valuable quantum\nresources for such games. In particular, the quantum prediction of the MNMS\ndecreases as the linear entropy increases, and then ceases to be nonlocal when\nthe linear entropy reaches the critical points ${2}/{3}$ and ${9}/{14}$ for the\ntwo- and three-qubit cases, respectively. The MNMS are related to classical\nerrors in experimental preparation of maximally entangled states.\n", "  The molecular Schr\\\"odinger equation is rewritten in terms of non-unitary\nequations of motion for the nuclei (or electrons) that depend parametrically on\nthe configuration of an ensemble of generally defined electronic (or nuclear)\ntrajectories. This scheme is exact and does not rely on the tracing-out of\ndegrees of freedom. Hence, the use of trajectory-based statistical techniques\ncan be exploited to circumvent the calculation of the computationally demanding\nBorn-Oppenheimer potential-energy surfaces and non-adiabatic coupling elements.\nThe concept of potential-energy surface is restored by establishing a formal\nconnection with the exact factorization of the full wave function. This\nconnection is used to gain insight from a simplified form of the exact\npropagation scheme.\n", "  We investigate the role of networks of alliances in preventing (multilateral)\ninterstate wars. We first show that, in the absence of international trade, no\nnetwork of alliances is peaceful and stable. We then show that international\ntrade induces peaceful and stable networks: trade increases the density of\nalliances so that countries are less vulnerable to attack and also reduces\ncountries' incentives to attack an ally. We present historical data on wars and\ntrade, noting that the dramatic drop in interstate wars since 1950, and\naccompanying densification and stabilization of alliances, are consistent with\nthe model but not other prominent theories.\n", "  We analyze the possibility of reduction of systemic risk in financial markets\nthrough Pigouvian taxation of financial institutions which is used to support\nthe rescue fund. We introduce the concept of the cascade risk with a clear\noperational definition as a subclass and a network related measure of the\nsystemic risk. Using financial networks constructed from real Italian money\nmarket data and using realistic parameters, we show that the cascade risk can\nbe substantially reduced by a small rate of taxation and by means of a simple\nstrategy of the money transfer from the rescue fund to interbanking market\nsubjects. Furthermore, we show that while negative effects on the return on\ninvestment ($ROI$) are direct and certain, an overall positive effect on risk\nadjusted return on investments ($ROI^{RA}$) is visible. Please note that\n\\emph{the taxation} is introduced as a monetary/regulatory, not as a fiscal\nmeasure, as the term could suggest. \\emph{The rescue fund} is implemented in a\nform of a common reserve fund.\n", "  The physical mechanism of CO2 trapping in porous media by capillary trapping\n(pore scale) incorporates a number of related processes, i.e. residual\ntrapping, trapping due to hysteresis of the relative permeability, and trapping\ndue to hysteresis of the capillary pressure. Additionally CO2 may be trapped in\nheterogeneous media due to difference in capillary pressure entry points for\ndifferent materials (facies scale). The amount of CO2 trapped by these\nprocesses depends upon a complex system of non-linear and hysteretic\nrelationships including how relative permeability and capillary pressure vary\nwith brine and CO2 saturation, and upon the spatial variation in these\nrelationships as caused by geologic heterogeneity. Geological heterogeneities\naffect the dynamics of CO2 plumes in subsurface environments. Recent studies\nhave led to new conceptual and quantitative models for sedimentary architecture\nin fluvial deposits over a range of scales that are relevant to the performance\nof some deep saline reservoirs. We investigated how the dynamics of a CO2\nplume, during and after injection, is influenced by the hierarchical and\nmulti-scale stratal architecture in such reservoirs. The results strongly\nsuggest that representing small scales features (decimeter to meter), including\ntheir organization within a hierarchy of larger-scale features, is critical to\nunderstanding trapping processes.\n", "  We demonstrate the possibility of generation of coherent radiation with\ntunable frequencies higher than the frequency of the driving field $\\nu _{d}$\nin a nonlinear medium utilizing the difference combination resonance that\noccurs when $\\nu _{d}$ matches the difference of the frequencies of the two\ngenerated fields $\\omega _{1}$ and $\\omega _{2}$. We find that such a resonance\ncan appear in materials which have opposite signs of refractive index at\n$\\omega _{1}$ and $\\omega _{2}$. It can also occur in positive refractive index\nmaterials with strong anomalous dispersion if at one of the generated\nfrequencies the group and phase velocities are opposite to each other. We show\nthat the light amplification mechanism is equivalent to a combination resonance\nin a system of two coupled parametric oscillators with the opposite sign of\nmasses. Such a mechanism holds promise for a new kind of light source that\nemits coherent radiation of tunable wavelengths by an optical parametric\namplification process with the frequency higher than $\\nu_{d}$.\n", "  The repertoire of lymphocyte receptors in the adaptive immune system protects\norganisms from diverse pathogens. A well-adapted repertoire should be tuned to\nthe pathogenic environment to reduce the cost of infections. We develop a\ngeneral framework for predicting the optimal repertoire that minimizes the cost\nof infections contracted from a given distribution of pathogens. The theory\npredicts that the immune system will have more receptors for rare antigens than\nexpected from the frequency of encounters; individuals exposed to the same\ninfections will have sparse repertoires that are largely different, but\nnevertheless exploit cross-reactivity to provide the same coverage of antigens;\nand the optimal repertoires can be reached via the dynamics of competitive\nbinding of antigens by receptors, and selective amplification of stimulated\nreceptors. Our results follow from a tension between the statistics of pathogen\ndetection, which favor a broader receptor distribution, and the effects of\ncross-reactivity, which tend to concentrate the optimal repertoire onto a few\nhighly abundant clones. Our predictions can be tested in high throughput\nsurveys of receptor and pathogen diversity.\n", "  We develop further the new versions of quantum chromatic numbers of graphs\nintroduced by the first and fourth authors. We prove that the problem of\ncomputation of the commuting quantum chromatic number of a graph is solvable by\nan SDP algorithm and describe an hierarchy of variants of the commuting quantum\nchromatic number which converge to it. We introduce the tracial rank of a\ngraph, a parameter that gives a lower bound for the commuting quantum chromatic\nnumber and parallels the projective rank, and prove that it is multiplicative.\nWe describe the tracial rank, the projective rank and the fractional chromatic\nnumbers in a unified manner that clarifies their connection with the commuting\nquantum chromatic number, the quantum chromatic number and the classical\nchromatic number, respectively. Finally, we present a new SDP algorithm that\nyields a parameter larger than the Lov\\'asz number and is yet a lower bound for\nthe tracial rank of the graph. We determine the precise value of the tracial\nrank of an odd cycle.\n", "  Using a simple exactly solvable model, we show that event-dependent time\ndelays may lead to significant non-Poisson effects in the statistics of polymer\nchain growth. The results are confirmed by stochastic simulation of various\ngrowth scenarios.\n", "  We prove a stability result in the hybrid inverse problem of recovering the\nelectrical conductivity from partial knowledge of one current density field\ngenerated inside a body by an imposed boundary voltage. The region where\ninterior data stably reconstructs the conductivity is well defined by a\ncombination of the exact and perturbed data.\n", "  In the past decade, large scale mobile phone data have become available for\nthe study of human movement patterns. These data hold an immense promise for\nunderstanding human behavior on a vast scale, and with a precision and accuracy\nnever before possible with censuses, surveys or other existing data collection\ntechniques. There is already a significant body of literature that has made key\ninroads into understanding human mobility using this exciting new data source,\nand there have been several different measures of mobility used. However,\nexisting mobile phone based mobility measures are inconsistent, inaccurate, and\nconfounded with social characteristics of local context. New measures would\nbest be developed immediately as they will influence future studies of mobility\nusing mobile phone data. In this article, we do exactly this. We discuss\nproblems with existing mobile phone based measures of mobility and describe new\nmethods for measuring mobility that address these concerns. Our measures of\nmobility, which incorporate both mobile phone records and detailed GIS data,\nare designed to address the spatial nature of human mobility, to remain\nindependent of social characteristics of context, and to be comparable across\ngeographic regions and time. We also contribute a discussion of the variety of\nuses for these new measures in developing a better understanding of how human\nmobility influences micro-level human behaviors and well-being, and macro-level\nsocial organization and change.\n", "  Participation in social groups are important but the collective behaviors of\nhuman as a group are difficult to analyze due to the difficulties to quantify\nordinary social relation, group membership, and to collect a comprehensive\ndataset. Such difficulties can be circumvented by analyzing online social\nnetworks. In this paper, we analyze a comprehensive dataset obtained from\nTencent QQ, an instant messenger with the highest market share in China.\nSpecifically, we analyze three derivative networks involving groups and their\nmembers -- the hypergraph of groups, the network of groups and the user network\n-- to reveal social interactions at microscopic and mesoscopic level. Our\nresults uncover interesting behaviors on the growth of user groups, the\ninteractions between groups, and their relationship with member age and gender.\nThese findings lead to insights which are difficult to obtain in ordinary\nsocial networks.\n", "  We consider the parametric representation of the amplitudes of Abelian models\nin the so-called framework of rank $d$ Tensorial Group Field Theory. These\nmodels are called Abelian because their fields live on $U(1)^D$. We concentrate\non the case when these models are endowed with particular kinetic terms\ninvolving a linear power in momenta. New dimensional regularization and\nrenormalization schemes are introduced for particular models in this class: a\nrank 3 tensor model, an infinite tower of matrix models $\\phi^{2n}$ over\n$U(1)$, and a matrix model over $U(1)^2$. For all divergent amplitudes, we\nidentify a domain of meromorphicity in a strip determined by the real part of\nthe group dimension $D$. From this point, the ordinary subtraction program is\napplied and leads to convergent and analytic renormalized integrals.\nFurthermore, we identify and study in depth the Symanzik polynomials provided\nby the parametric amplitudes of generic rank $d$ Abelian models. We find that\nthese polynomials do not satisfy the ordinary Tutte's rules\n(contraction/deletion). By scrutinizing the \"face\"-structure of these\npolynomials, we find a generalized polynomial which turns out to be stable only\nunder contraction.\n", "  We present all-sky modelling of the high resolution Planck, IRAS, and WISE\ninfrared (IR) observations using the physical dust model presented by Draine\nand Li in 2007 (DL). We study the performance and results of this model, and\ndiscuss implications for future dust modelling. The present work extends the DL\ndust modelling carried out on nearby galaxies using Herschel and Spitzer data\nto Galactic dust emission. We employ the DL dust model to generate maps of the\ndust mass surface density, the optical extinction Av, and the starlight\nintensity parametrized by Umin. The DL model reproduces the observed spectral\nenergy distribution (SED) satisfactorily over most of the sky, with small\ndeviations in the inner Galactic disk and in low ecliptic latitude areas. We\ncompare the DL optical extinction Av for the diffuse interstellar medium with\noptical estimates for 2 10^5 quasi-stellar objects (QSOs) observed in the Sloan\ndigital sky survey. The DL Av estimates are larger than those determined\ntowards QSOs by a factor of about 2, which depends on Umin. The DL fitting\nparameter Umin, effectively determined by the wavelength where the SED peaks,\nappears to trace variations in the far-IR opacity of the dust grains per unit\nAv, and not only in the starlight intensity. To circumvent the model\ndeficiency, we propose an empirical renormalization of the DL Av estimate,\ndependent of Umin, which compensates for the systematic differences found with\nQSO observations. This renormalization also brings into agreement the DL Av\nestimates with those derived for molecular clouds from the near-IR colours of\nstars in the 2 micron all sky survey. The DL model and the QSOs data are used\nto compress the spectral information in the Planck and IRAS observations for\nthe diffuse ISM to a family of 20 SEDs normalized per Av, parameterized by\nUmin, which may be used to test and empirically calibrate dust models.\n", "  One fascinating aspect of the brain is its ability to process information in\na fast and reliable manner. The functional architecture is thought to play a\ncentral role in this task, by encoding efficiently complex stimuli and\nfacilitating higher level processing. In the early visual cortex of higher\nmammals, information is processed within functional maps whose layout is\nthought to underlie visual perception. The possible principles underlying the\ntopology of the different maps, as well as the role of a specific functional\narchitecture on information processing, is however poorly understood. We\ndemonstrate mathematically here that two natural principles, local exhaustivity\nof representation and parsimony, would constrain the orientation and spatial\nfrequency maps to display co-located singularities around which the orientation\nis organized as a pinwheel and spatial frequency as a dipole. This observation\nis perfectly in line with new optical imaging data on the cat visual cortex we\nanalyze in a companion paper. Here we further focus on the theoretical\nimplications of this structure. Using a computational model, we show that this\narchitecture allows a trade-off in the local perception of orientation and\nspatial frequency, but this would occur for sharper selectivity than the tuning\nwidth reported in the literature. We therefore re-examined physiological data\nand show that indeed the spatial frequency selectivity substantially sharpens\nnear maps singularities, bringing to the prediction that the system tends to\noptimize balanced detection between different attributes. These results shed\nnew light on the principles at play in the emergence of functional architecture\nof cortical maps, as well as their potential role in processing information.\n", "  We focused on how repeat collaborations in projects for inventions affect\nperformance. Repeat collaborations have two contradictory aspects. A positive\naspect is team development or experience, and a negative aspect is team\ndegeneration or decline. Since both contradicting phenomena are observed,\ninventors have a dilemma as to whether they should keep collaborating in a team\nor not. The dilemma has not previously been quantitatively analyzed.\n  We provide quantitative and extensive analyses of the dilemma in creative\nprojects by using patent data from Japan and the United States. We confirm\nthree predictions to quantitatively validate the existence of the dilemma. The\nfirst prediction is that the greater the patent a team achieves, the longer the\nteam will work together. The second prediction is that the impact of\nconsecutive patents decreases after a team makes a remarkable invention, which\nis measured by the impact of patents. The third prediction is that the\nexpectation of impact with new teams is greater than that with the same teams\nsuccessful in the past. We find these predictions are validated in patents\npublished in Japan and the United States. On the basis of these three\npredictions, we can quantitatively validate the dilemma in creative projects.\nWe also propose preventive strategies for degeneration. One is developing\ntechnological diversity, and another is developing inventor diversity in\nteams.We find the two strategies are both effective by validating with the\ndata.\n", "  We propose a mechanism in which the lightness of Higgs boson and the\nsmallness of CP-violation are correlated based on the Lee model, namely the\nspontaneous CP-violation two-Higgs-doublet-model. In this model, the mass of\nthe lightest Higgs boson $m_h$ as well as the quantities $K$ and $J$ are\n$\\propto t_{\\beta}s_{\\xi}$ in the limit $t_{\\beta}s_{\\xi}\\rightarrow0$ (see\ntext for definitions of $t_\\beta$ and $\\xi$), namely the CP conservation limit.\nHere $K$ and $J$ are the measures for CP-violation effects in scalar and Yukawa\nsectors respectively. It is a new way to understand why the Higgs boson\ndiscovered at the LHC is light. We investigated the important constraints from\nboth high energy LHC data and numerous low energy experiments, especially the\nmeasurements of EDMs of electron and neutron as well as the quantities of\nB-meson and kaon. Confronting all data, we found that this model is still\nviable. It should be emphasized that there is no standard-model limit for this\nscenario, thus it is always testable for future experiments. In order to pin\ndown Lee model, it is important to discover the extra neutral and charged Higgs\nbosons and measure their CP properties and the flavor-changing decays. At the\nLHC with $\\sqrt{s}=14\\textrm{TeV}$, this scenario is favored if there is\nsignificant suppression in the $b\\bar{b}$ decay channel or any vector boson\nfusion (VBF), V+H production channels. On the contrary, it will be disfavored\nif the signal strengths are standard-model-like more and more. It can be easily\nexcluded at $(3\\sim5)\\sigma$ level with several $\\textrm{fb}^{-1}$ at future\n$e^+e^-$ colliders, via the accurately measuring the Higgs boson production\ncross sections.\n", "  Cobalt nanoparticle-based ferrofluid in the presence of external magnetic\nfield forms a self-assembled hyperbolic metamaterial. Wave equation describing\npropagation of extraordinary light inside the ferrofluid exhibits 2+1\ndimensional Lorentz symmetry. The role of time in the corresponding effective\n3D Minkowski spacetime is played by the spatial coordinate directed along the\nperiodic nanoparticle chains aligned by the magnetic field. Here we present a\nmicroscopic study of point, linear, planar and volume defects of the\nnanoparticle chain structure and demonstrate that they may exhibit strong\nsimilarities with such Minkowski spacetime defects as magnetic monopoles,\ncosmic strings and the recently proposed spacetime cloaks. Experimental\nobservations of such defects are described.\n", "  Populations of isogenic embryonic stem cells or clonal bacteria often exhibit\nextensive phenotypic heterogeneity which arises from stochastic intrinsic\ndynamics of cells. The internal state of the cell can be transmitted\nepigenetically in cell division, leading to correlations in the phenotypic\nstates of cells related by descent. Therefore, a phenotypic snapshot of a\ncollection of cells with known genealogical structure, contains information on\nphenotypic dynamics. Here we use a model of phenotypic dynamics on a\ngenealogical tree to define an inference method which allows to extract an\napproximate probabilistic description of phenotypic dynamics based on measured\ncorrelations as a function of the degree of kinship. The approach is tested and\nvalidated on the example of Pyoverdine dynamics in P. aeruginosa colonies.\nInterestingly, we find that correlations among pairs and triples of distant\nrelatives have a simple but non-trivial structure indicating that observed\nphenotypic dynamics on the genealogical tree is approximately conformal - a\nsymmetry characteristic of critical behavior in physical systems. Proposed\ninference method is sufficiently general to be applied in any system where\nlineage information is available.\n", "  We investigate an immediate application in finite strain multiplicative\nplasticity of the family of isotropic volumetric-isochoric decoupled strain\nenergies \\begin{align*} F\\mapsto W_{_{\\rm eH}}(F):=\\hat{W}_{_{\\rm\neH}}(U):=\\{\\begin{array}{lll} \\frac{\\mu}{k}\\,e^{k\\,\\|{\\rm dev}_n\\log\n{U}\\|^2}+\\frac{\\kappa}{{\\text{}}{2\\, {\\hat{k}}}}\\,e^{\\hat{k}\\,[{\\rm tr}(\\log\nU)]^2}&\\text{if}& {\\rm det}\\, F>0,\\\\ +\\infty &\\text{if} &{\\rm det} F\\leq 0,\n\\end{array}.\\quad \\end{align*} based on the Hencky-logarithmic (true, natural)\nstrain tensor $\\log U$. Here, $\\mu>0$ is the infinitesimal shear modulus,\n$\\kappa=\\frac{2\\mu+3\\lambda}{3}>0$ is the infinitesimal bulk modulus with\n$\\lambda$ the first Lam\\'{e} constant, $k,\\hat{k}$ are dimensionless fitting\nparameters, $F=\\nabla \\varphi$ is the gradient of deformation, $U=\\sqrt{F^T F}$\nis the right stretch tensor and ${\\rm dev}_n\\log {U} =\\log {U}-\\frac{1}{n}\\,\n{\\rm tr}(\\log {U})\\cdot 1\\!\\!1$ is the deviatoric part of the strain tensor\n$\\log U$. Based on the multiplicative decomposition $F=F_e\\, F_p$, we couple\nthese energies with some isotropic elasto-plastic flow rules $F_p\\,\\frac{\\rm\nd}{{\\rm d} t}[F_p^{-1}]\\in-\\partial \\chi({\\rm dev}_3 \\Sigma_{e})$ defined in\nthe plastic distortion $F_p$, where $\\partial \\chi$ is the subdifferential of\nthe indicator function $\\chi$ of the convex elastic domain $\\mathcal{E}_{\\rm\ne}(W_{\\rm iso},{\\Sigma_{e}},\\frac{1}{3}{\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}}_{\\!\\mathbf{y}}^2)$\nin the mixed-variant $\\Sigma_{e}$-stress space and $\\Sigma_{e}=F_e^T D_{F_e}\nW_{\\rm iso}(F_e)$. While $W_{_{\\rm eH}}$ may loose ellipticity, we show that\nloss of ellipticity is effectively prevented by the coupling with plasticity,\nsince the ellipticity domain of $W_{_{\\rm eH}}$ on the one hand, and the\nelastic domain in $\\Sigma_{e}$-stress space on the other hand, are closely\nrelated.\n", "  Using two innovations, smooth, but distinctly different, scaling laws for the\nnumerical reconnection of pairs of initially orthogonal and anti-parallel\nquantum vortices are obtained using the three-dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii\nequations, the simplest mean-field non-linear Schr\\\"odinger equation for a\nquantum fluid. The first innovation suppresses temporal fluctuations by using\nan initial density profile that is slightly below the usual two-dimensional\nsteady-state Pad\\'e approximate profiles. The second innovation is to find the\ntrajectories of the quantum vortices from a pseudo-vorticity constructed on the\nthree-dimensional grid from the gradients of the wave function. These\ntrajectories then allow one to calculate the Frenet-Serret frames and the\ncurvature of the vortex lines. For the anti-parallel case, the scaling laws\njust before and after reconnection obey the dimensional\n$\\delta\\sim|t_r-t|^{1/2}$ prediction with temporal symmetry about the\nreconnection time $t_r$ and physical space symmetry about the $x_r$, the\nmid-point between the vortices, with extensions of the vortex lines formng the\nedges of an equilateral pyramid. For all of the orthogonal cases, before\nreconnection $\\delta_{in}\\sim(t-t_r)^{1/3}$ and after reconnection\n$\\delta_{out}\\sim(t-t_r)^{2/3}$, which are respectively slower and faster than\nthe dimensional prediction. In these cases, the reconnection takes place in a\nplane defined by the directions of the curvature and vorticity. To define the\nstructure further, lines are drawn that connect the four arms that extend from\nthe reconnection plane, four angles $\\theta_i$ between these arms are found,\nthen summed, giving $\\sum\\theta_i>360^\\circ$. This implies that the overall\nstructure is convex or hyperbolic, as opposed to the acute angles of the\nanti-parallel pyramid.\n", "  This paper presents the proof-of-concept investigation for a miniaturized\nvectorcardiogram [VCG] system for ambulatory on-body applications that\ncontinuously monitors the electrical activity of the heart in three dimensions.\nWe investigate the minimum distance between a pair of leads in the X, Y and Z\naxes such that the signals are distinguishable from the noise. The target\ndimensions for our VCG are 3x3x2 cm and, based on our preliminary results, it\nis possible to achieve these dimensions. The next step in our research is to\nbuild the miniaturized VCG system that includes processing, learning and\ncommunication capabilities.\n", "  Impact of science is one of the most important topics in scientometrics.\nRecent developments show a fundamental change in impact measurements from\nimpact on science to impact on society. Since impact measurement is currently\nin a state of far reaching changes, this paper describes recent developments\nand facing problems in this area. For that the results of key publications\n(dealing with impact measurement) are discussed. The paper discusses how impact\nis generally measured within science and beyond (section 2), which effects\nimpact measurements have on the science system (section 3), and which problems\nare associated with impact measurement (section 4). The problems associated\nwith impact measurement constitute the focus of this paper: Science is marked\nby inequality, random chance, anomalies, the right to make mistakes,\nunpredictability, and a high significance of extreme events, which might\ndistort impact measurements. Scientometricians as the producer of impact scores\nand decision makers as their consumers should be aware of these problems and\nshould consider them in the generation and interpretation of bibliometric\nresults, respectively.\n", "  We study ground states of Ising models with random ferromagnetic couplings,\nproving the triviality of all zero-temperature metastates. This unexpected\nresult sheds a new light on the properties of these systems, putting strong\nrestrictions on their possible ground state structure. Open problems related to\nexistence of interface-supporting ground states are stated and an\ninterpretation of the main result in terms of first-passage and random surface\nmodels in a random environment is presented.\n", "  A general, fast, and effective approach is developed for numerical\ncalculation of kinetic plasma dispersion relations. The plasma dispersion\nfunction is approximated by $J$-pole expansion. Subsequently, the dispersion\nrelation is transformed to a standard matrix eigenvalue problem of an\nequivalent linear system. The result is accurate for $J=8$ except the solutions\nthat are the little interesting heavily damped modes. In contrast to\nconventional approaches, such as Newton's iterative method, this approach can\ngive either all the solutions in the system or a few solutions around the\ninitial guess. It is also free from convergent problems. The approach is\ndemonstrated from electrostatic one-dimensional and three-dimensional\ndispersion relations, to electromagnetic kinetic magnetized plasma dispersion\nrelation for bi-Maxwellian distribution with parallel velocity drift.\n", "  We study long time series of the ion saturation current and floating\npotential, sampled by Langmuir probes dwelled in the outboard mid-plane scrape\noff layer and embedded in the lower divertor baffle of Alcator C-Mod. A series\nof ohmically heated L-mode plasma discharges is investigated with line-averaged\nplasma density ranging from n_e/n_G = 0.15 to 0.42, where n_G is the Greenwald\ndensity.\n  All ion saturation current time series that are sampled in the far scrape-off\nlayer are characterized by large-amplitude burst events. Coefficients of\nskewness and excess kurtosis of the time series obey a quadratic relationship\nand their histograms coincide partially upon proper normalization. Histograms\nof the ion saturation current time series are found to agree well with a\nprediction of a stochastic model for the particle density fluctuations in\nscrape-off layer plasmas.\n  The distribution of the waiting times between successive large-amplitude\nburst events and of the burst amplitudes are approximately described by\nexponential distributions. The average waiting time and burst amplitude are\nfound to vary weakly with the line-averaged plasma density.\n  Conditional averaging reveals that the radial blob velocity, estimated from\nfloating potential measurements, increases with the normalized burst amplitude\nin the outboard mid-plane scrape-off layer. For low density discharges, the\nconditionally averaged waveform of the floating potential associated with large\namplitude bursts at the divertor probes has a dipolar shape. In detached\ndivertor conditions the average waveform is random, indicating electrical\ndisconnection of blobs from the sheaths at the divertor targets.\n", "  Generalizing Dollard's strategy, we investigate the structure of the\nscattering theory associated to any large time reference dynamics $U_D(t)$\nallowing for the existence of M{\\o}ller operators. We show that (for each\nscattering channel) $U_D(t)$ uniquely identifies, for $t \\to \\pm \\infty$, {\\em\nasymptotic dynamics} $U_\\pm(t)$; they are unitary {\\em groups} acting on the\nscattering spaces, satisfy the M{\\o}ller interpolation formulas and are\ninterpolated by the $S$-matrix. In view of the application to field theory\nmodels, we extend the result to the adiabatic procedure. In the Heisenberg\npicture, asymptotic variables are obtained as LSZ-like limits of Heisenberg\nvariables; their time evolution is induced by $U_\\pm(t)$, which replace the\nusual free asymptotic dynamics. On the asymptotic states, (for each channel)\nthe Hamiltonian can by written in terms of the asymptotic variables as $H =\nH_\\pm (q_{out/in}, p_{out/in})$, $ H_\\pm (q,p) $ the generator of the\nasymptotic dynamics. As an application, we obtain the asymptotic fields\n$\\psi_{out/in}$ in repulsive Coulomb scattering by an LSZ modified formula; in\nthis case, $U_\\pm(t)= U_0(t)$, so that $\\psi_{out/in}$ are \\emph{free}\ncanonical fields and $H = H_0(\\psi_{out/in})$.\n", "  Superconducting nanowires are the dual elements to Josephson junctions, with\nquantum phase-slip processes replacing the tunneling of Cooper pairs. When the\nquantum phase-slip amplitude ES is much smaller than the inductive energy EL,\nthe nanowire responds as a superconducting inductor. When the inductive energy\nis small, the response is capacitive. The crossover at low temperatures as a\nfunction of ES/EL is discussed and compared with earlier experimental results.\nFor one-dimensional and two-dimensional arrays of nanowires quantum phase\ntransitions are expected as a function of ES/EL. They can be tuned by a\nhomogeneous magnetic frustration.\n", "  The multiband nature of iron pnictides gives rise to a rich\ntemperature-doping phase diagram of competing orders and a plethora of\ncollective phenomena. At low dopings, the tetragonal-to-orthorhombic structural\ntransition is closely followed by a spin density wave transition both being in\nclose proximity to the superconducting phase. A key question is the nature of\nhigh-$T_c$ superconductivity and its relation to orbital ordering and\nmagnetism. Here we study the NaFe$_{1-x}$Co$_{x}$As superconductor using\npolarization-resolved Raman spectroscopy. The Raman susceptibility displays\ncritical enhancement of non-symmetric charge fluctuations across the entire\nphase diagram which are precursors to a $d$-wave Pomeranchuk instability at\ntemperature $\\theta(\\mbox{x})$. The charge fluctuations are interpreted in\nterms of quadrupole inter-orbital excitations in which the electron and hole\nFermi surfaces breathe in-phase. Below $T_c$, the critical fluctuations acquire\ncoherence and undergo a metamorphosis into a coherent ingap mode of\nextraordinary strength.\n", "  In this paper we will present an ongoing project which aims to use model\ntheory as a suitable mathematical setting for studying the formalism of quantum\nmechanics. We will argue that this approach provides a geometric semantics for\nsuch formalism by means of establishing a (non-commutative) duality between\ncertain algebraic and geometric objects.\n", "  The behavior of fermions in the gauge field created by the energon, a\nrecently found classical solution of the non-Abelian gauge theory, is\nconsidered. The spectrum of fermions is evaluated explicitly for the case when\nparameters governing the energon are chosen to make this solution look similar\nto the chain of well separated instantons and anti-instantons. The zero\neigenvalue in the spectrum of the Dirac equation is found. The role of a\nspecific discrete symmetry, which distinguishes the energon, is discussed.\n", "  Results are presented from a search for new physics in final states\ncontaining a photon and missing transverse momentum. The data correspond to an\nintegrated luminosity of 19.6 inverse femtobarns collected in proton-proton\ncollisions at sqrt(s) = 8 TeV with the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC. No\ndeviation from the standard model predictions is observed for these final\nstates. New, improved limits are set on dark matter production and on\nparameters of models with large extra dimensions. In particular, the first\nlimits from the LHC on branon production are found and significantly extend\nprevious limits from LEP and the Tevatron. An upper limit of 14.0 fb on the\ncross section is set at the 95% confidence level for events with a monophoton\nfinal state with photon transverse momentum greater than 145 GeV and missing\ntransverse momentum greater than 140 GeV.\n", "  The ability to cool single ions, atomic ensembles, and more recently\nmacroscopic degrees of freedom down to the quantum groundstate has generated\nconsiderable progress and perspectives in Basic and Technological Science.\nThese major advances have been essentially obtained by coupling mechanical\nmotion to a resonant electromagnetic degree of freedom in what is generally\nknown as laser cooling. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate the first\nself-induced coherent cooling mechanism that is not mediated by the\nelectromagnetic field. Using a focused electron beam, we report a 50-fold\nreduction of the motional temperature of a nanowire. Our result primarily\nrelies on the sub-nanometer confinement of the electron beam and generalizes to\nany delayed and topologically confined interaction, with important consequences\nfor near-field microscopy and fundamental nanoscale dissipation mechanisms.\n", "  Nowadays, nonhomogeneous and periodic ferromagnetic materials are the subject\nof a growing interest. Actually such periodic configurations often combine the\nattributes of the constituent materials, while sometimes, their properties can\nbe strikingly different from the properties of the different constituents.\nThese periodic configurations can be therefore used to achieve physical and\nchemical properties difficult to achieve with homogeneous materials. To predict\nthe magnetic behavior of such composite materials is of prime importance for\napplications. The main objective of this paper is to perform, by means of\nGamma-convergence and two-scale convergence, a rigorous derivation of the\nhomogenized Gibbs-Landau free energy functional associated to a composite\nperiodic ferromagnetic material, i.e. a ferromagnetic material in which the\nheterogeneities are periodically distributed inside the ferromagnetic media. We\nthus describe the Gamma-limit of the Gibbs-Landau free energy functional, as\nthe period over which the heterogeneities are distributed inside the\nferromagnetic body shrinks to zero.\n", "  We study the adiabatic pumping of the Chern-Simons axion (CSA) coupling along\na parametric loop characterized by a non-zero second Chern number $C^{(2)}$\nfrom the viewpoint of the hybrid Wannier representation, in which the Wannier\ncharge centers (WCCs) are visualized as sheets defined over a projected 2D\nBrillouin zone. We derive a new formula for the CSA coupling, expressing it as\nan integral involving Berry curvatures and potentials defined on the WCC\nsheets. We show that a loop characterized by a non-zero $C^{(2)}$ requires a\nseries of sheet-touching events at which $2\\pi$ quanta of Berry curvature are\npassed from sheet to sheet, in such a way that $e^2/h$ units of CSA coupling\nare pumped by a lattice vector by the end of the cycle. We illustrate these\nbehaviors via explicit calculations on a model tight-binding Hamiltonian and\ndiscuss their implications.\n", "  Dark matter (DM) halos of Sc-Im and dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies satisfy\nscaling laws: halos in lower-luminosity galaxies have smaller core radii,\nhigher central densities, and smaller velocity dispersions. These results are\nbased on maximum-disk rotation curve decompositions for giant galaxies and\nJeans equation analysis for dwarfs. (1) We show that spiral, Im, and Sph\ngalaxies with absolute magnitudes M_V > -18 form a sequence of decreasing\nbaryon-to-DM surface density with decreasing luminosity. We suggest that this\nis a sequence of decreasing baryon retention vs. supernova-driven losses or\ndecreasing baryon capture after cosmological reionization. (2) The structural\ndifferences between S+Im and Sph galaxies are small. Both are affected mostly\nby the physics that controls baryon depletion. (3) There is a linear\ncorrelation between the maximum rotation velocities of baryonic disks and the\nouter circular velocities V_circ of test particles in their DM halos. Baryons\nbecome unimportant at V_circ = 42+-4 km/s. Smaller galaxies are dim or dark.\n(4) We find that, before baryon \"loss\", dSph galaxies were brighter by ~4 mag\nand dIm galaxies were brighter by ~3.5 mag. Both have DM halos that are massive\nenough to help to solve the \"Too Big To Fail\" problem with DM galaxy formation.\n(5) We suggest that there exist many galaxies that are too dark to be\ndiscovered by current techniques, as required by cold DM theory. (6) Projected\ncentral densities of DM halos are constant from M_B ~ -5 to -22. This implies a\nFaber-Jackson law with halo mass M ~ (halo dispersion)**4.\n", "  In social networks, it is conventionally thought that two individuals with\nmore overlapped friends tend to establish a new friendship, which could be\nstated as homophily breeding new connections. While the recent hypothesis of\nmaximum information entropy is presented as the possible origin of effective\nnavigation in small-world networks. We find there exists a competition between\ninformation entropy maximization and homophily in local structure through both\ntheoretical and experimental analysis. This competition means that a newly\nbuilt relationship between two individuals with more common friends would lead\nto less information entropy gain for them. We conjecture that in the evolution\nof the social network, both of the two assumptions coexist. The rule of maximum\ninformation entropy produces weak ties in the network, while the law of\nhomophily makes the network highly clustered locally and the individuals would\nobtain strong and trust ties. Our findings shed light on the social network\nmodeling from a new perspective.\n", "  Based on a first-principles approach, we show that in a single crystal of a\nprototypical topological insulator such as Bi$_2$Se$_3$ the difference in the\nwork function between adjacent surfaces with different crystal-face\norientations generates a built-in electric field around facet edges. Owing to\nthe topological magnetoelectric coupling for a given broken time-reversal\nsymmetry in the crystal, the electric field, in turn, forces effective magnetic\ndipoles to accumulate along the edges, realizing the facet-edge magnetic\nordering. We demonstrate that the predicted magnetic ordering which depends\nonly on the work function difference between facets, is in fact a manifestation\nof the axion electrodynamics in real solids.\n", "  Recently, M. de Le\\'on el al. ([9]) have developed a geometric\nHamilton-Jacobi theory for Classical Field Theories in the setting of\nmultisymplectic geometry. Our purpose in the current paper is to establish the\ncorresponding Hamilton-Jacobi theory in the Cauchy data space, and relate both\napproaches.\n", "  We introduce topological defect to a square lattice of elliptical cylinders.\nDespite the broken translational symmetry, the long-range positional order of\nthe cylinders leads to residual photonic bandgap in the density of optical\nstates. However, the band-edge modes are strongly modified by the spatial\nvariation of ellipse orientation. The $\\Gamma-X$ band-edge mode splits into\nfour regions of high intensity and the output flux becomes asymmetric due to\nthe formation of crystalline domains with different orientation. The $\\Gamma-M$\nband-edge mode has the energy flux circulates around the topological defect\ncenter, creating an optical vortex. By removing the elliptical cylinders at the\ncenter, we create localized defect states which are dominated by either\nclockwise or counter-clockwise circulating waves. The flow direction can be\nswitched by changing the ellipse orientation. The deterministic aperiodic\nvariation of the unit cell orientation adds another dimension to the control of\nlight in photonic crystals, enabling creation of diversified field pattern and\nenergy flow landscape.\n", "  We study the spreading of initially localized excitations in 1D disordered\ngranular crystals. We thereby investigate localization phenomena in strongly\nnonlinear systems, which we demonstrate to be fundamentally different from\nlocalization in linear and weakly nonlinear systems. We compare wave dynamics\nin chains with 3 different types of disorder: an uncorrelated (Anderson-like)\ndisorder and 2 types of correlated disorders (random dimer arrangements), and\nfor 2 types of initial conditions: displacement excitations and velocity\nexcitations. For strongly precompressed chains, the dynamics depend strongly on\nthe initial condition. For displacement excitations, the long-time behavior of\nthe second moment $\\tilde{m}_2$ has oscillations that depend on the type of\ndisorder, with a complex trend that differs markedly from a power law and which\nis particularly evident for an Anderson disorder. For velocity excitations, we\nfind a scaling $\\tilde{m}_2\\sim t^{\\gamma}$ (for a constant $\\gamma$) for all 3\ntypes of disorder. For weakly precompressed (strongly nonlinear) chains,\n$\\tilde{m}_2$ and the inverse participation ratio $P^{-1}$ satisfy\n$\\tilde{m}_2\\sim t^{\\gamma}$ and $P^{-1}\\sim t^{-\\eta}$, and the dynamics is\nsuperdiffusive for all examined cases. When precompression is strong, the IPR\ndecreases slowly for all 3 types of disorder, and we observe a partial\nlocalization around the core and the leading edge of the wave. For an Anderson\ndisorder, displacement perturbations lead to localization of energy primarily\nin the core, and velocity perturbations cause the energy to be divided between\nthe core and the leading edge. This localization phenomenon does not occur in\nthe sonic-vacuum regime, which yields the surprising result that the energy is\nno longer contained in strongly nonlinear waves but instead is spread across\nmany sites. In this regime, the exponents are very similar in all cases.\n", "  Chemical differentiation of rocky planets occurs by melt segregation away\nfrom the region of melting. The mechanics of this process, however, are complex\nand incompletely understood. In partially molten rocks undergoing shear\ndeformation, melt pockets between grains align coherently in the stress field;\nit has been hypothesized that this anisotropy in microstructure creates an\nanisotropy in the viscosity of the aggregate. With the inclusion of anisotropic\nviscosity, continuum, two-phase-flow models reproduce the emergence and angle\nof melt-enriched bands that form in laboratory experiments. In the same\ntheoretical context, these models also predict sample-scale melt migration due\nto a gradient in shear stress. Under torsional deformation, melt is expected to\nsegregate radially inward. Here we present new torsional deformation\nexperiments on partially molten rocks that test this prediction.\nMicrostructural analyses of the distribution of melt and solid reveal a radial\ngradient in melt fraction, with more melt toward the centre of the cylinder.\nThe extent of this radial melt segregation grows with progressive strain,\nconsistent with theory. The agreement between theoretical prediction and\nexperimental observation provides a validation of this theory, which is\ncritical to understanding the large-scale geodynamic and geochemical evolution\nof Earth.\n", "  We consider the nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation on the half-line with a\ngiven Dirichlet (Neumann) boundary datum which for large $t$ tends to the\nperiodic function $g_0^b(t)$ ($g_1^b(t)$). Assuming that the unknown Neumann\n(Dirichlet) boundary value tends for large $t$ to a periodic function\n$g_1^b(t)$ ($g_0^b(t)$), we derive an easily verifiable condition that the\nfunctions $g_0^b(t)$ and $g_1^b(t)$ must satisfy. Furthermore, we introduce two\ndifferent methods, one based on the formulation of a Riemann-Hilbert problem,\nand one based on a perturbative approach, for constructing $g_1^b(t)$\n($g_0^b(t)$) in terms of $g_0^b(t)$ ($g_1^b(t)$).\n", "  We consider the nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation on the half-line with a\ngiven Dirichlet boundary datum which for large $t$ tends to a periodic\nfunction. We assume that this function is sufficiently small, namely that it\ncan be expressed in the form $\\alpha g_0^b(t)$, where $\\alpha$ is a small\nconstant. Assuming that the Neumann boundary value tends for large $t$ to the\nperiodic function $g_1^b(t)$, we show that $g_1^b(t)$ can be expressed in terms\nof a perturbation series in $\\alpha$ which can be constructed explicitly to any\ndesired order. As an illustration, we compute $g_1^b(t)$ to order $\\alpha^8$\nfor the particular case that $g_0^b(t)$ is the sum of two exponentials. We also\nshow that there exist particular functions $g_0^b(t)$ for which the above\nseries can be summed up, and therefore for these functions $g_1^b(t)$ can be\nobtained in closed form. The simplest such function is $\\exp(i\\omega t)$, where\n$\\omega$ is a real constant.\n", "  We developed a high-power laser system at a wavelength of 399 nm for laser\ncooling of ytterbium atoms with ultraviolet laser diodes. The system is\ncomposed of an external cavity laser diode providing frequency stabilized\noutput at a power of 40 mW and another laser diode for amplifying the laser\npower up to 220 mW by injection locking. The systematic method for optimization\nof our injection locking can also be applied to high power light sources at any\nother wavelengths. Our system, which does not depend on complex nonlinear\nfrequency-doubling, has great importance for implementing transportable optical\nlattice clocks, and is also useful for investigations on condensed matter\nphysics or quantum information processing using cold atoms.\n", "  The paper examines the impact of different modelling choices in second-moment\nclosures by assessing model performance in predicting 3-D duct flows. The\ntest-cases (developing flow in a square duct [Gessner F.B., Emery A.F.: {\\em\nASME J. Fluids Eng.} {\\bf 103} (1981) 445--455], circular-to-rectangular\ntransition-duct [Davis D.O., Gessner F.B.: {\\em AIAA J.} {\\bf 30} (1992)\n367--375], and \\tsn{S}-duct with large separation [Wellborn S.R., Reichert\nB.A., Okiishi T.H.: {\\em J. Prop. Power} {\\bf 10} (1994) 668--675]) include\nprogressively more complex strains. Comparison of experimental data with\nselected 7-equation models (6 Reynolds-stress-transport and 1 scale-determining\nequations), which differ in the closure of the velocity/pressure-gradient\ntensor $\\Pi_{ij}$, suggests that rapid redistribution controls separation and\nsecondary-flow prediction, whereas, inclusion of pressure-diffusion modelling\nimproves reattachment and relaxation behaviour.\n", "  Shock waves are steep wave fronts that are fundamental in nature, especially\nin high-speed fluid flows. When a shock hits an obstacle, or a flying body\nmeets a shock, shock reflection/diffraction phenomena occur. In this paper, we\nshow how several longstanding shock reflection/diffraction problems can be\nformulated as free boundary problems, discuss some recent progress in\ndeveloping mathematical ideas, approaches, and techniques for solving these\nproblems, and present some further open problems in this direction. In\nparticular, these shock problems include von Neumann's problem for shock\nreflection-diffraction by two-dimensional wedges with concave corner,\nLighthill's problem for shock diffraction by two-dimensional wedges with convex\ncorner, and Prandtl-Meyer's problem for supersonic flow impinging onto solid\nwedges, which are also fundamental in the mathematical theory of\nmultidimensional conservation laws.\n", "  We present a novel memory device that consists of a thin ferromagnetic layer\nof Fe deposited on topological insulator thin film, Bi2Se3. The ferromagnetic\nlayer has perpendicular anisotropy, due to MgO deposited on the top surface of\nFe. When current is passed on the surface of Bi2Se3, the surface of the Bi2Se3\nbecomes spin polarized and strong exchange interaction occurs between the d\nelectrons in the ferromagnet and the electrons conducting the current on the\nsurface of the Bi2Se3. Part of the current is shunted through the ferromagnet\nwhich generates spin transfer torque in the ferromagnet. The combination of the\nspin transfer torque and exchange interaction torque along with\nvoltage-controlled magnetic anisotropy (VCMA) allows ultralow-energy switching\nof the ferromagnet. We perform micromagnetic simulations and predict switching\ntime of the order of 2.5 ns and switching energy of the order of 0.45fJ for a\nferromagnetic bit with thermal stability of 43kBT. Such ultralow-energy and\nhigh-speed VCMA-induced switching of a perpendicular anisotropy ferromagnet on\na topological insulator could be utilized for energy-efficient memory design.\n", "  We study the effect of confinement on the mean perimeter of the convex hull\nof a planar Brownian motion, defined as the minimum convex polygon enclosing\nthe trajectory. We use a minimal model where an infinite reflecting wall\nconfines the walk to its one side. We show that the mean perimeter displays a\nsurprising minimum with respect to the starting distance to the wall and\nexhibits a non-analyticity for small distances. In addition, the mean span of\nthe trajectory in a fixed direction {$\\theta \\in ]0,\\pi/2[$}, which can be\nshown to yield the mean perimeter by integration over $\\theta$, presents these\nsame two characteristics. This is in striking contrast with the one dimensional\ncase, where the mean span is an increasing analytical function. The\nnon-monotonicity in the 2D case originates from the competition between two\nantagonistic effects due to the presence of the wall: reduction of the space\naccessible to the Brownian motion and effective repulsion.\n", "  Physical interactions between particles are the result of the exchange of\ngauge bosons. Human interactions are mediated by the exchange of messages,\ngoods, money, promises, hostilities, etc. While in the physical world\ninteractions and their associated forces have immediate dynamical consequences\n(Newton's law) the situation is not clear for human interactions. Here we study\nthe acceleration between humans who interact through the exchange of messages,\ngoods and hostilities in a massive multiplayer online game. For this game we\nhave complete information about all interactions (exchange events) between\nabout 1/2 million players, and about their trajectories (positions) in a metric\nspace of the game universe at any point in time. We derive the interaction\npotentials for communication, trade and attacks and show that they are harmonic\nin nature. Individuals who exchange messages and trade goods generally attract\neach other and start to separate immediately after exchange events stop. The\ninteraction potential for attacks mirrors the usual \"hit-and-run\" tactics of\naggressive players. By measuring interaction intensities as a function of\ndistance, velocity and acceleration, we show that \"forces\" between players are\ndirectly related to the number of exchange events. The power-law of the\nlikelihood for interactions vs. distance is in accordance with previous real\nworld empirical work. We show that the obtained potentials can be understood\nwith a simple model assuming an exchange-driven force in combination with a\ndistance dependent exchange rate.\n", "  I relate contextuality to line bundles. Line bundles are important in\nalgebraic geometry, they determine through their global sections rational maps\nto projective spaces. I explain how such maps, if they exist, relate rationally\nthe input and output of measurement based computation (MBQC) and show\ngeometrically that, indeed, contextuality is a necessary resource for the\ncomputational advantage in MBQC. I also leverage the definition of MBQC to\ncategory theory and present it as a \"subfunctor\" of the spectral presheaf. In\ngeneral, the MBQC functor is pointless whereas the computation is trivial.\n", "  The `deautonomisation' of an integrable mapping of the plane consists in\ntreating the free parameters in the mapping as functions of the independent\nvariable, the precise expressions of which are to be determined with the help\nof a suitable criterion for integrability. Standard practice is to use the\nsingularity confinement criterion and to require that singularities be confined\nat the very first opportunity. An algebro-geometrical analysis will show that\nconfinement at a later stage invariably leads to a nonintegrable deautonomized\nsystem, thus justifying the standard singularity confinement approach. In\nparticular, it will be shown on some selected examples of discrete Painleve\nequations, how their regularisation through blow-up yields exactly the same\nconditions on the parameters in the mapping as the singularity confinement\ncriterion. Moreover, for all these examples, it will be shown that the\nconditions on the parameters are in fact equivalent to a linear transformation\non part of the Picard group, obtained from the blow-up.\n", "  We analyse a large sample of the Twitter activity developed around the social\nmovement 'Occupy Wall Street' to study the complex interactions between the\nhuman communication activity and the semantic content of a discussion. We use a\nnetwork approach based on the analysis of the bipartite graph @Users-#Hashtags\nand of its projections: the 'semantic network', whose nodes are hashtags, and\nthe 'users interest network', whose nodes are users In the first instance, we\nfind out that discussion topics (#hashtags) present a high heterogeneity, with\nthe distinct role of the communication hubs where most the 'opinion traffic'\npasses through. In the second case, the self-organization process of users\nactivity leads to the emergence of two classes of communicators: the\n'professionals' and the 'amateurs'. Moreover the network presents a strong\ncommunity structure, based on the differentiation of the semantic topics, and a\nhigh level of structural robustness when a certain set of topics are censored\nand/or accounts are removed. Analysing the characteristics the @Users-#Hashtags\nnetwork we can distinguish three phases of the discussion about the movement.\nEach phase corresponds to specific moment of the movement: from declaration of\nintent, organisation and development and the final phase of political\nreactions. Each phase is characterised by the presence of specific #hashtags in\nthe discussion. Keywords: Twitter, Network analysis\n", "  By a further study of the mechanism of the hyperbolic regularization of the\nmoment system for Boltzmann equation proposed in [Z. Cai, Y. Fan, R. Li, Comm.\nMath. Sci. 11(2): 547-571, 2013], we point out that the key point is treating\nthe time and space derivative in the same way. Based on this understanding, a\nuniform framework to derive globally hyperbolic moment systems from kinetic\nequations using an operator projection method is proposed. The framework is so\nconcise and clear that it can be treated as an algorithm with four inputs to\nderive hyperbolic moment system by routine calculations. Almost all existing\nglobally hyperbolic moment system can be included in the framework, as well as\nsome new moment system including globally hyperbolic regularized versions of\nGrad ordered moment system and a multidimensional extension of the\nquadrature-based moment system.\n", "  We show that the dispersionless limits of the Pfaff-KP (also known as the DKP\nor Pfaff lattice) and the Pfaff-Toda hierarchies admit a reformulation through\nelliptic functions. In the elliptic form they look like natural elliptic\ndeformations of the KP and 2D Toda hierarchy respectively.\n", "  We demonstrate an effective control of nonlinear interactions of lasing modes\nin a semiconductor microdisk cavity by shaping the pump profile. A target mode\nis selected at the expense of its competing modes either by increasing their\nlasing thresholds or suppressing their power slopes above the lasing threshold.\nDespite of strong spatial overlap of the lasing modes at the disk boundary,\nadaptive pumping enables an efficient selection of any lasing mode to be the\ndominant one, leading to a switch of lasing frequency. The theoretical analysis\nillustrates both linear and nonlinear effects of selective pumping, and\nquantify their contributions to lasing mode selection. This work shows that\nadaptive pumping not only provides a powerful tool of controlling the nonlinear\nprocess in multimode lasers, but also enables the tuning of lasing\ncharacteristic after the lasers have been fabricated.\n", "  Gene expression in individual cells is highly variable and sporadic, often\nresulting in the synthesis of mRNAs and proteins in bursts. Bursting in gene\nexpression is known to impact cell-fate in diverse systems ranging from latency\nin HIV-1 viral infections to cellular differentiation. It is generally assumed\nthat bursts are geometrically distributed and that they arrive according to a\nPoisson process. On the other hand, recent single-cell experiments provide\nevidence for complex burst arrival processes, highlighting the need for more\ngeneral stochastic models. To address this issue, we invoke a mapping between\ngeneral models of gene expression and systems studied in queueing theory to\nderive exact analytical expressions for the moments associated with\nmRNA/protein steady-state distributions. These moments are then used to derive\nexplicit conditions, based entirely on experimentally measurable quantities,\nthat determine if the burst distributions deviate from the geometric\ndistribution or if burst arrival deviates from a Poisson process. For\nnon-Poisson arrivals, we develop approaches for accurate estimation of burst\nparameters.\n", "  We report on the influence of disorder on an exciton-polariton condensate in\na ZnO based bulk planar microcavity and compare experimental results with a\ntheoretical model for a non-equilibrium condensate. Experimentally, we detect\nintensity fluctuations within the far-field emission pattern even at high\ncondensate densities which indicates a significant impact of disorder. We show\nthat these effects rely on the driven dissipative nature of the condensate and\nargue that they can be accounted for by spatial phase inhomogeneities induced\nby disorder, which occur even for increasing condensate densities realized in\nthe regime of high excitation power. Thus, non-equilibrium effects strongly\nsuppress the stabilization of the condensate against disorder, contrarily to\nwhat is expected for equilibrium condensates in the high density limit.\nNumerical simulations based on our theoretical model reproduce the experimental\ndata.\n", "  There are several ideal boundaries and completions in General Relativity\nsharing the topological property of being sequential, i.e., determined by the\nconvergence of its sequences and, so, by some limit operator $L$. As emphasized\nin a classical article by Geroch, Liang and Wald, some of them have the\nproperty, commonly regarded as a drawback, that there are points of the\nspacetime $M$ non $T_1$-separated from points of the boundary $\\partial M$.\n  Here we show that this problem can be solved from a general topological\nviewpoint. In particular, there is a canonical minimum refinement of the\ntopology in the completion $\\overline{M}$ which $T_2$-separates the spacetime\n$M$ and its boundary $\\partial M$ ---no matter the type of completion one\nchooses. Moreover, we analyze the case of sequential spaces and show how the\nrefined $T_2$-separating topology can be constructed from a modification $L^*$\nof the original limit operator $L$. Finally, we particularize this procedure to\nthe case of the causal boundary and show how the separability of $M$ and\n$\\partial M$ can be introduced as an abstract axiom in its definition.\n", "  This paper explains the delayed choice quantum eraser of Kim et al. in terms\nof the transactional interpretation of quantum mechanics by John Cramer. It is\nkept deliberately mathematically simple to help explain the transactional\ntechnique. The emphasis is on a clear understanding of how the instantaneous\n\"collapse\" of the wave function due to a measurement at a specific time and\nplace may be reinterpreted as a gradual collapse over the entire path of the\nphoton and over the entire transit time from slit to detector. This is made\npossible by the use of a retarded offer wave, which is thought to travel from\nthe slits (or rather the small region within the parametric crystal where\ndown-conversion takes place) to the detector and an advanced counter wave\ntraveling backward in time from the detector to the slits. The point here is to\nmake clear how simple the Cramer transactional picture is and how much more\nintuitive the collapse of the wave function becomes if viewed in this way. Also\nany confusion about possible retro-causal signaling is put to rest. A delayed\nchoice quantum eraser does not require any sort of backward in time\ncommunication. This paper makes the point that it is preferable to use the\nTransactional Interpretation (TI) over the usual Copenhagen Interpretation (CI)\nfor a more intuitive understanding of the quantum eraser delayed choice\nexperiment. Both methods give exactly the same end results and can be used\ninterchangeably.\n", "  In this paper we analyze supergeometric locally covariant quantum field\ntheories. We develop suitable categories SLoc of super-Cartan supermanifolds,\nwhich generalize Lorentz manifolds in ordinary quantum field theory, and show\nthat, starting from a few representation theoretic and geometric data, one can\nconstruct a functor A : SLoc --> S*Alg to the category of super-*-algebras\nwhich can be interpreted as a non-interacting super-quantum field theory. This\nconstruction turns out to disregard supersymmetry transformations as the\nmorphism sets in the above categories are too small. We then solve this problem\nby using techniques from enriched category theory, which allows us to replace\nthe morphism sets by suitable morphism supersets that contain supersymmetry\ntransformations as their higher superpoints. We construct super-quantum field\ntheories in terms of enriched functors eA : eSLoc --> eS*Alg between the\nenriched categories and show that supersymmetry transformations are\nappropriately described within the enriched framework. As examples we analyze\nthe superparticle in 1|1-dimensions and the free Wess-Zumino model in\n3|2-dimensions.\n", "  We investigate the cosmology of a class of model with noncanonical scalar\nfield and matter in an anisotropic time dependent background. Writing the\nEinstein Equations in terms of dimensionless dynamical variables appropriately\ndefined for bouncing solutions, we find all the fixed points. From the bouncing\nconditions and stability of fixed points, solutions describing non singular\nbounce are obtained.\n", "  We study the survival probability and the first-passage time distribution for\na Brownian motion in a planar wedge with infinite absorbing edges. We\ngeneralize existing results obtained for wedge angles of the form $\\pi/n$ with\n$n$ a positive integer to arbitrary angles, which in particular cover the case\nof obtuse angles. We give explicit and simple expressions of the survival\nprobability and the first-passage time distribution in which the difference\nbetween an arbitrary angle and a submultiple of $\\pi$ is contained in three\nadditional terms. As an application, we obtain the short time development of\nthe survival probability in a wedge of arbitrary angle.\n", "  The anomalously large rates of some hadronic transitions from quarkonium are\nstudied using QCD multipole expansion (QCDME) in the framework of a constituent\nquark model which has been successful in describing hadronic phenomenology. The\nhybrid intermediate states needed in the QCDME method are calculated in a\nnatural extension of our constituent quark model based on the Quark Confining\nString (QCS) scheme. Some of the anomalies are explained due to the presence of\nan hybrid state with a mass near the mass of the decaying resonance whereas\nother are justified by the presence of molecular components in the wave\nfunction. Some unexpected results are pointed out.\n", "  We consider the random normal matrices with quadratic external potentials\nwhere the associated orthogonal polynomials are Hermite polynomials and the\nlimiting support (called droplet) of the eigenvalues is an ellipse. We\ncalculate the density of the eigenvalues near the boundary of the droplet up to\nthe second subleading corrections and express the subleading corrections in\nterms of the curvature of the droplet boundary. From this result we\nadditionally get the expected number of eigenvalues outside the droplet. We\nalso obtain the asymptotics of the kernel and found that, in the bulk, the\ncorrection term is exponentially small. This leads to the vanishing of certain\nCauchy transform of the orthogonal polynomial in the bulk of the droplet up to\nan exponentially small error.\n", "  The bacterial flagellar motor (BFM) is responsible for driving bacterial\nlocomotion and chemotaxis, fundamental processes in pathogenesis and biofilm\nformation. In the BFM, torque is generated at the interface between\ntransmembrane proteins (stators) and a rotor. It is well-established that the\npassage of ions down a transmembrane gradient through the stator complex\nprovides the energy needed for torque generation. However, the physics involved\nin this energy conversion remain poorly understood. Here we propose a\nmechanically specific model for torque generation in the BFM. In particular, we\nidentify two fundamental forces involved in torque generation: electrostatic\nand steric. We propose that electrostatic forces serve to position the stator,\nwhile steric forces comprise the actual 'power stroke'. Specifically, we\npredict that ion-induced conformational changes about a proline 'hinge' residue\nin an $\\alpha$-helix of the stator are directly responsible for generating the\npower stroke. Our model predictions fit well with recent experiments on a\nsingle-stator motor. Furthermore, we propose several experiments to elucidate\nthe torque-speed relationship in motors where the number of stators may not be\nconstant. The proposed model provides a mechanical explanation for several\nfundamental features of the flagellar motor, including: torque-speed and\nspeed-ion motive force relationships, backstepping, variation in step sizes,\nand the puzzle of swarming experiments.\n", "  Traditional fact checking by expert journalists cannot keep up with the\nenormous volume of information that is now generated online. Computational fact\nchecking may significantly enhance our ability to evaluate the veracity of\ndubious information. Here we show that the complexities of human fact checking\ncan be approximated quite well by finding the shortest path between concept\nnodes under properly defined semantic proximity metrics on knowledge graphs.\nFramed as a network problem this approach is feasible with efficient\ncomputational techniques. We evaluate this approach by examining tens of\nthousands of claims related to history, entertainment, geography, and\nbiographical information using a public knowledge graph extracted from\nWikipedia. Statements independently known to be true consistently receive\nhigher support via our method than do false ones. These findings represent a\nsignificant step toward scalable computational fact-checking methods that may\none day mitigate the spread of harmful misinformation.\n", "  In this paper we present several multipartite quantum systems featuring the\nsame type of genuine (tripartite) entanglement. Based on a geometric\ninterpretation of the so-called $|W\\rangle$ and $|GHZ\\rangle$ states we show\nthat the classification of all multipartite systems featuring those and only\nthose two classes of genuine entanglement can be deduced from earlier work of\nalgebraic geometers. This classification corresponds in fact to classification\nof fundamental subadjoint varieties and establish a connection between those\nsystems, well known in Quantum Information Theory and fundamental simple Lie\nalgebras.\n", "  Through a reciprocal transformation $\\mathcal{T}_0$ induced by the\nconservation law $\\partial_t(u_x^2) = \\partial_x(2uu_x^2)$, the Hunter-Saxton\n(HS) equation $u_{xt} = 2uu_{2x} + u_x^2$ is shown to possess conserved\ndensities involving arbitrary smooth functions, which have their roots in\ninfinitesimal symmetries of $w_t = w^2$, the counterpart of the HS equation\nunder $\\mathcal{T}_0$. Hierarchies of commuting symmetries of the HS equation\nare studied under appropriate changes of variables initiated by\n$\\mathcal{T}_0$, and two of these are linearized while the other is identical\nto the hierarchy of commuting symmetries admitted by the potential modified\nKorteweg-de Vries equation. A fifth order symmetry of the HS equation is\nendowed with a sixth order hereditary recursion operator by its connection with\nthe Fordy-Gibbons equation. These results reveal the origin for the rich and\nremarkable structures of the HS equation and partially answer the questions\nraised by Wang [{\\it Nonlinearity} {\\bf 23}(2010) 2009].\n", "  Recent progress in constructing holographic models for QCD is discussed,\nconcentrating on the bottom-up models which implement holographically the\nrenormalization group flow of QCD. The dynamics of gluons can be modeled by\nusing a string-inspired model termed improved holographic QCD, and flavor can\nbe added by introducing space filling branes in this model. The flavor fully\nbackreacts to the glue in the Veneziano limit, giving rise to a class of models\nwhich are called V-QCD. The phase diagrams and spectra of V-QCD are in good\nagreement with results for QCD obtained by other methods.\n", "  We give a short introduction to the calculation of the leading chiral\nlogarithms, and present the results of the recent evaluation of the leading\nlogarithm series for the nucleon mass within the heavy baryon theory. The\npresented results are the first example of leading logarithm calculation in the\nnucleon ChPT. We also discuss some regularities observed in the leading\nlogarithmical series for nucleon mass. The talk has been presented at \"Quark\nConfinement and the Hadron Spectrum XI\".\n", "  The C-parameter event-shape distribution for e+e- annihilation into hadrons\nis computed in the framework of SCET including input from fixed-order\nperturbation theory. We calculate all missing ingredients for achieving N3LL\nresummation accuracy in the cross section, which is then matched onto\nO(alpha_s^3) fixed-order results. Hadronization power corrections are\nincorporated as a convolution with a nonperturbative shape function. Wide-angle\nsoft radiation effects introduce an O(Lambda_QCD) renormalon ambiguity in the\ncross section, which we cure by switching to the Rgap short-distance scheme. We\nalso include hadron mass effects, but find their effect is rather small.\nPerforming fits to the tail of the C-parameter distribution for many center of\nmass energies we find that the strong coupling constant is alpha_s(mZ) = 0.1123\n+-0.0015, with chi^2/dof=0.99.\n", "  Drag of electrons of 1D ballistic nanowire by a nearby 1D beam of ions is\nconsidered. We assume that the ion beam is represented by an ensemble of heavy\nions of the same velocity $\\bf V$. The ratio of the drag current to primary\ncurrent carried by the ion beam is calculated.\n  The drag current appears to be a nonmonotonic function of velocity $V$, it\nhas maxima for $V$ near $v_{nF}/2$ where $n$ is the number of electron miniband\n(channel) and $v_{nF}$ is the corresponding Fermi velocity. This means that the\nion beam drag can be applied for ballistic nanostructure spectroscopy.\n", "  We analyse a multiplex of networks between OECD countries during the decade\n2002-2010, which consists of five financial layers, given by foreign direct\ninvestment, equity securities, short-term, long-term and total debt securities,\nand five environmental layers, given by emissions of N O x, P M 10 SO 2, CO 2\nequivalent and the water footprint associated with international trade. We\npresent a new measure of cross-layer correlations between flows in different\nlayers based on reciprocity. For the assessment of results, we implement a null\nmodel for this measure based on the exponential random graph theory. We find\nthat short-term financial flows are more correlated with environmental flows\nthan long-term investments. Moreover, the correlations between reverse\nfinancial and environmental flows (i.e. flows of different layers going in\nopposite directions) are generally stronger than correlations between synergic\nflows (flows going in the same direction). This suggests a trade-off between\nfinancial and environmental layers, where, more financialised countries display\nhigher correlations between outgoing financial flows and incoming environmental\nflows from lower financialised countries, which could have important policy\nimplications. Five countries are identified as hubs in this finance-environment\nmultiplex: The United States, France, Germany, Belgium-Luxembourg and the\nUnited Kingdom.\n", "  This research expository article contains a survey of earlier work (in\n\\S2--\\S4) but also contains a main new result (in \\S5), which we first\ndescribe. Given $c \\geq 0$, the spectral operator $\\mathfrak{a} =\n\\mathfrak{a}_c$ can be thought of intuitively as the operator which sends the\ngeometry onto the spectrum of a fractal string of dimension not exceeding $c$.\nRigorously, it turns out to coincide with a suitable quantization of the\nRiemann zeta function $\\zeta = \\zeta(s)$: $\\mathfrak{a} = \\zeta (\\partial)$,\nwhere $\\partial = \\partial_c$ is the infinitesimal shift of the real line\nacting on the weighted Hilbert space $L^2 (\\mathbb{R}, e^{-2ct} dt)$. In this\npaper, we establish a new asymmetric criterion for the Riemann hypothesis,\nexpressed in terms of the invertibility of the spectral operator for all values\nof the dimension parameter $c \\in (0, 1/2)$ (i.e., for all $c$ in the left half\nof the critical interval $(0,1)$). This corresponds (conditionally) to a\nmathematical (and perhaps also, physical) \"phase transition\" occurring in the\nmidfractal case when $c= 1/2$. Both the universality and the non-universality\nof $\\zeta = \\zeta (s)$ in the right (resp., left) critical strip $\\{1/2 <\n\\text{Re}(s) < 1 \\}$ (resp., $\\{0 < \\text{Re}(s) < 1/2 \\}$) play a key role in\nthis context. These new results are presented in \\S5. In \\S2, we briefly\ndiscuss earlier joint work on the complex dimensions of fractal strings, while\nin \\S3 and \\S4, we survey earlier related work of the author with H. Maier and\nwith H. Herichi, respectively, in which were established symmetric criteria for\nthe Riemann hypothesis, expressed respectively in terms of a family of natural\ninverse spectral problems for fractal strings of Minkowski dimension $D \\in\n(0,1),$ with $D \\neq 1/2$, and of the quasi-invertibility of the family of\nspectral operators $\\mathfrak{a}_c$ (with $c \\in (0,1), c \\neq 1/2$).\n", "  We consider the construction of local bulk operators in a black hole\nbackground dual to a pure state in conformal field theory. The properties of\nthese operators in a microcanonical ensemble are studied. It has been argued in\nthe literature that typical states in such an ensemble contain firewalls, or\notherwise singular horizons. We argue this conclusion can be avoided with a\nproper definition of the interior operators.\n", "  We introduce a probability current analysis of excitation energy transfer\nbetween states of an open quantum system. Expressing the energy transfer\nthrough currents of excitation probability between the states in a site\nrepresentation enables us to gain key insights into the energy transfer\ndynamics. It allows to, i) identify the pathways of energy transport in large\nnetworks of sites and to quantify their relative weights, ii) quantify the\nrespective contributions of unitary dynamics, dephasing, and\nrelaxation/dissipation processes to the energy transfer, and iii) quantify the\ncontribution of coherence to the energy transfer. Our analysis is general and\ncan be applied to a broad range of open quantum system descriptions (with\ncoupling to non-Markovian environments) in a straightforward manner.\n", "  In an effective field theory framework we review the two main mechanisms of\nquarkonium dissociation in a weakly coupled thermal bath.\n", "  Devices based on ultracold atoms moving in an accelerating optical lattice or\ndouble-well potential are a promising tool for precise measurements of\nfundamental physical constants as well as for the construction of sensors.\nHere, we carefully analyze the model of a couple of BECs separated by a barrier\nin an accelerated field and we show how the observable quantities, mainly the\nperiod of the beating motion or of the phase-shift, are related to the physical\nparameters of the model as well as to the energy of the initial state.\n", "  Electromagnetic polarizabilities are important parameters for understanding\nthe interaction between photons and hadrons. For pions these quantities are\npoorly constrained experimentally since they can only be measured indirectly.\nNew experiments at CERN and Jefferson Lab are planned that will measure the\npolarizabilities more precisely. Lattice QCD can be used to compute these\nquantities directly in terms of quark and gluons degrees of freedom, using the\nbackground field method. We present results for the electric polarizability for\ntwo different quark masses, light enough to connect to chiral perturbation\ntheory. These are currently the lightest quark masses used in polarizability\nstudies.\n", "  Contrary to a widely spread believe, we have demonstrated that strongly\ncoupled electroweak models including both a light Higgs-like boson and massive\nspin-1 resonances are not in conflict with experimental constraints on the\noblique S and T parameters. We use an effective Lagrangian implementing the\nchiral symmetry breaking SU(2)_L x SU(2)_R -> SU(2)_{L+R} that contains the\nStandard Model gauge bosons coupled to the electroweak Goldstones, one\nHiggs-like scalar state h with mass m_h=126 GeV and the lightest vector and\naxial-vector resonance multiplets V and A. We have considered the one-loop\ncalculation of S and T in order to study the viability of these\nstrongly-coupled scenarios, being short-distance constraints and dispersive\nrelations the main ingredients of the calculation. Once we have constrained the\nresonance parameters, we do a first approach to the determination of the low\nenergy constants of the electroweak effective theory at low energies (without\nresonances). We show this determination in the case of the purely Higgsless\nbosonic Lagrangian.\n", "  The magnetic properties of two important passive magnetic shielding materials\n(A4K and Amumetal) for accelerator applications, subjected to various\nprocessing and heat treatment conditions are studied comprehensively over a\nwide range of temperatures: from Cryogenic to room temperature. We analyze the\neffect of processing on the extent of degradation of the magnetic properties of\nboth materials and investigate the possibility of restoring these properties by\nre-annealing.\n", "  The potential of performing a combined analysis of the strangeness-changing\ndecays $\\tau^{-}\\to K_{S}\\pi^{-}\\nu_{\\tau}$ and $\\tau^{-}\\to\nK^{-}\\eta\\nu_{\\tau}$ for unveiling the $K^{*}(1410)$ resonance pole parameters\nis illustrated. Our study is carried out within the framework of Chiral\nPerturbation Theory, including resonances as explicit degrees of freedom.\nResummation of final state interactions are considered through a dispersive\nparameterization of the required form factors. A considerable improvement in\nthe determination of the pole position with mass $M_{K^{*}(1410)}=1304\\pm17$\nMeV and width $\\Gamma_{K^{*}(1410)}=171\\pm62$ MeV is obtained.\n", "  We investigate the stability of spherically symmetric, purely magnetic,\nsoliton and black hole solutions of four-dimensional ${\\mathfrak {su}}(N)$\nEinstein-Yang-Mills theory with a negative cosmological constant $\\Lambda $.\nThese solutions are described by $N-1$ magnetic gauge field functions $\\omega\n_{j}$. We consider linear, spherically symmetric, perturbations of these\nsolutions. The perturbations decouple into two sectors, known as the\nsphaleronic and gravitational sectors. For any $N$, there are no instabilities\nin the sphaleronic sector if all the magnetic gauge field functions $\\omega\n_{j}$ have no zeros, and satisfy a set of $N-1$ inequalities. In the\ngravitational sector, we are able to prove that there are solutions which have\nno instabilities in a neighbourhood of stable embedded ${\\mathfrak {su}}(2)$\nsolutions, provided the magnitude of the cosmological constant $\\left| \\Lambda\n\\right| $ is sufficiently large.\n", "  We study a variational model from micromagnetics involving a nonlocal\nGinzburg-Landau type energy for S^1-valued vector fields. These vector fields\nform domain walls, called Neel walls, that correspond to one-dimensional\ntransitions between two directions within the unit circle S^1. Due to the\nnonlocality of the energy, a Neel wall is a two length scale object, comprising\na core and two logarithmically decaying tails. Our aim is to determine the\nenergy differences leading to repulsion or attraction between Neel walls. In\ncontrast to the usual Ginzburg-Landau vortices, we obtain a renormalised energy\nfor Neel walls that shows both a tail-tail interaction and a core-tail\ninteraction. This is a novel feature for Ginzburg-Landau type energies that\nentails attraction between Neel walls of the same sign and repulsion between\nNeel walls of opposite signs.\n", "  In the dissipative quantum dynamics of a mesoscopic aggregate of excited two\nlevel systems (atoms) coupled to a single resonance mode of a cavity, two\nphysical phenomena associated with superradiance appear. A pronounced emission\npeak on short time scales is related to the known superradiant burst of excited\natoms cooperatively radiating into free space. It is followed by relaxation to\na stationary state of the composite system such that for sufficiently large\natom-field coupling a strongly correlated state emerges. The crossover to this\nstate can be interpreted as the precursor of the transition from normal to\nsuperradiant phase in the thermodynamic limit of the Dicke Hamiltonian.\nMotivated by recent experimental activities, these features are investigated in\ndetail for a mesoscopic number of atoms and a cavity embedded in a dissipative\nmedium described by a damped Dicke model. We identify observables and\ncharacteristics of the quantum dynamics on shorter time scales which allow to\nclearly distinguish weakly correlated from strongly correlated Dicke physics.\n", "  We study the operator product expansion of the plaquette (gluon condensate)\nand the self-energy of an infinitely heavy quark. We first compute their\nperturbative expansions to order $\\alpha^{35}$ and $\\alpha^{20}$, respectively,\nin the lattice scheme. In both cases we reach the asymptotic regime where the\nrenormalon behavior sets in. Subtracting the perturbative series, we obtain the\nleading non-perturbative corrections of their respective operator product\nexpansions. In the first case we obtain the gluon condensate and in the second\nthe binding energy of the heavy quark in the infinite mass limit. The results\nare fully consistent with the expectations from renormalons and the operator\nproduct expansion.\n", "  The results of spin-polarized density functional theory calculations find\nthat band gap engineering can be achieved by site-specific interactions in a\ncomposite consisting of polyaniline and TiO2 nanoparticles. Interactions in the\ncomposite matrix are found to be mediated by Ti atoms inducing dependency of\nlocation of the conduction band minimum on the polyaniline site which is being\nprobed by TiO2. This dependency is due to subtle changes in the nature of\nvalance or conduction states near Fermi level introduced by the interacting\nmatrix sites. The results therefore suggest that optimization of the synthesis\nparameters at atomic level can be an effective way to improve performance of a\nphotovoltaic device based on PAni- TiO2 composite.\n", "  A generalized transport theorem for convecting irregular domains is presented\nin the setting of Federer's geometric measure theory. A prototypical\n$r$-dimensional domain is viewed as a flat $r$-chain of finite mass in an open\nset of an $n$-dimensional Euclidean space. The evolution of such a generalized\ndomain in time is assumed to be in accordance to a bi-Lipschitz type map. The\ninduced curve is shown to be continuous with respect to the flat norm and\ndifferential with respect to the sharp norm on currents in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$. A\ntime dependent property is naturally assigned to the evolving region via the\naction of an $r$-cochain on the current associated with the domain. Applying a\nrepresentation theorem for cochains the properties are shown to be locally\nrepresented by an $r$-form. Using these notions a generalized transport theorem\nis presented.\n", "  We present new results on the decay patterns of scalar and tensor glueballs\nin the top-down holographic Witten-Sakai-Sugimoto model. This model, which has\nonly one free dimensionless parameter, gives semi-quantitative predictions for\nthe vector meson spectrum, their decay widths, and also a gluon condensate in\nagreement with SVZ sum rules. The holographic predictions for scalar glueball\ndecay rates are compared with experimental data for the widely discussed gluon\ncandidates f0(1500) and f0(1710).\n", "  We show how equivariant volumes of tensor product quiver varieties of type A\nare given by matrix elements of vertex operators of centrally extended doubles\nof Yangians, and how they satisfy in some cases the rational, level 1, quantum\nKnizhnik--Zamolodchikov equation.\n", "  QCD at high chemical potential has interesting properties such as\ndeconfinement of quarks. Two-color QCD, which enables numerical simulations on\nthe lattice, constitutes a laboratory to study QCD at high chemical potential.\nAmong the interesting properties of two-color QCD at high density is the\ndiquark condensation, for which we present recent results obtained on a finer\nlattice compared to previous studies. The quark propagator in two-color QCD at\nnon-zero chemical potential is referred to as the Gor'kov propagator. We\nexpress the Gor'kov propagator in terms of form factors and present recent\nlattice simulation results.\n", "  We show how a fermionic quantum gas in an optical lattice and coupled to the\nfield of an optical cavity can self-organize into a state in which the\nspontaneously emerging cavity field amplitude induces an artificial magnetic\nfield. The fermions form either a chiral insulator or a chiral liquid carrying\nedge currents. The feedback mechanism via the cavity field enables robust and\nfast switching of the edge currents and the cavity output can be employed for\nnon-destructive measurements of the atomic dynamics.\n", "  We introduce a minimal theory of glass formation based on the ideas of\nmolecular crowding and resultant string-like cooperative rearrangement, and\naddress the effects of free interfaces. In the bulk case, we obtain a scaling\nexpression for the number of particles taking part in cooperative strings, and\nwe recover the Adam-Gibbs description of glassy dynamics. Then, by including\nthermal dilatation, the Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann relation is derived. Moreover,\nthe random and string-like characters of the cooperative rearrangement allow us\nto predict a temperature-dependent expression for the cooperative length $\\xi$\nof bulk relaxation. Finally, we explore the influence of sample boundaries when\nthe system size becomes comparable to $\\xi$. The theory is in agreement with\nmeasurements of the glass-transition temperature of thin polymer films, and\nallows to quantify the temperature-dependent thickness $h_{\\textrm{m}}$ of the\ninterfacial mobile layer.\n", "  First-principles calculations within the DFT are employed to investigate the\nrelationship between the electronic structure and the unexpected features of\nthe hexagonal cell parameters of YbAuIn and Yb$_{3}$AuGe$_{2}$In$_{3}$.\nCalculations indicate that YbAuIn is an intermediate valent system with one Yb\n4\\textit{f} state pinned to the Fermi level, while Yb$_{3}$AuGe$_{2}$In$_{3}$\nis closer to integer valency with all Yb 4\\textit{f} states occupied.\nStructural relaxations performed on LaAuIn and LuAuIn analogs reveal that\nexpansion of the \\textit{c}-parameter in Yb$_{3}$AuGe$_{2}$In$_{3}$ is\nattributable to larger size of the divalent Yb compared with intermediate\nvalent Yb.\n", "  The Higgs sector of the Minimal Supersymmetric Extension of the Standard\nModel may be described with a two Higgs doublet model with properties that\ndepend on the soft supersymmetry breaking parameters. For instance, flavor\nindependent CP-violating phases associated with the gaugino masses, the squark\ntrilinear mass parameters and the Higgsino mass parameter $\\mu$ may lead to\nsizable CP-violation in the Higgs sector. For these CP-violating effects to\naffect the properties of the recently observed SM-like Higgs resonance, the\nnon-standard charged and neutral Higgs bosons masses must be of the order of\nthe weak scale, and both $\\mu$ as well as the trilinear stop mass parameter\n$A_t$ must be of the order or larger than the stop mass parameters. Constraints\non this possibility come from direct searches for non-standard Higgs bosons,\nprecision measurements on the lightest neutral Higgs properties, including its\nmass, and electric dipole moments. In this article, we discuss these\nconstraints within the MSSM, trying to evaluate the possible size of the CP-odd\ncomponent of the lightest neutral Higgs boson, and the possible experimental\ntests of this CP-violating effect at the LHC.\n", "  We develop a non-relativistic twistor theory, in which Newton--Cartan\nstructures of Newtonian gravity correspond to complex three-manifolds with a\nfour-parameter family of rational curves with normal bundle ${\\mathcal\nO}\\oplus{\\mathcal O}(2)$. We show that the Newton--Cartan space-times are\nunstable under the general Kodaira deformation of the twistor complex\nstructure. The Newton--Cartan connections can nevertheless be reconstructed\nfrom Merkulov's generalisation of the Kodaira map augmented by a choice of a\nholomorphic line bundle over the twistor space trivial on twistor lines. The\nCoriolis force may be incorporated by holomorphic vector bundles, which in\ngeneral are non--trivial on twistor lines. The resulting geometries agree with\nnon--relativistic limits of anti-self-dual gravitational instantons.\n", "  Much effort has been made in trying to solve or at least evade the\ninconsistencies that emerge from general relativity as the framework for a\ncosmological model. The extradi- mensional models rise as superb possibilities\non this regard. In this work I present cosmo- logical solutions for Wesson's\nSpace-Time-Matter theory of gravity. A relation between mass variation at\ncosmological scales and the expansion velocity of the universe is ob- tained.\nSuch a relation yields novel features on Space-Time-Matter theory of gravity,\nwhich are carefully discussed.\n", "  In the present work, Monte-Carlo toy model with repulsing quark-gluon strings\nin hadron-hadron collisions is described. String repulsion creates transverse\nboosts for the string decay products, giving modifications of observables. As\nan example, long-range correlations between mean transverse momenta of\nparticles in two observation windows are studied in MC toy simulation of the\nheavy-ion collisions.\n", "  An exactly scale-invariant spectrum of scalar perturbation generated during\nde Sitter spacetime is found from the gravity model of the nonminimal\nderivative coupling with fourth-order term. The nonminimal derivative coupling\nterm generates a healthy (ghost-free) fourth-order derivative term, while the\nfourth-order term provides an unhealthy (ghost) fourth-order derivative term.\nThe Harrison-Zel'dovich spectrum obtained from Fourier transforming the\nfourth-order propagator in de Sitter space is recovered by computing the power\nspectrum in its momentum space directly. It shows that this model provides a\ntruly scale-invariant spectrum, in addition to the Lee-Wick scalar theory.\n", "  This paper summarizes what we have done so far to explain charged\ncharmonium/bottomonium-like structures using a hadronic triangle diagram which\nwe call the initial single chiral particle emission mechanism. We discuss\nprocesses like $A\\to A'+P+P'$ in which two chiral particles $P$ and $P'$ are\nemitted from $A$. In the intermediate we consider a hadronic one-loop diagram\nin which $D^{(*)}/D_s^{(*)}/B^{(*)}/B_s^{(*)}$ are included to explain some\nenhancements experimentally observed. Using this mechanism we explain some of\nthe exotic enhancements and predict a couple of enhancement structures.\n", "  In this talk we will summarize the main results from our recent work\nconcerning the possibility that a new metastable phase occurs in some heavy ion\ncollisions (HIC). This phase would be characterized by the breaking of two\ncharacteristic symmetries of strong interactions; namely P and CP. We\ninvestigate the experimental consequences of parity breaking in such a\nsituation and propose suitable observables to elucidate the presence this\nphenomenon.\n", "  We consider the evolution of quasi-free states describing $N$ fermions in the\nmean field limit, as governed by the nonlinear Hartree equation. In the limit\nof large $N$, we study the convergence towards the classical Vlasov equation.\nFor a class of regular interaction potentials, we establish precise bounds on\nthe rate of convergence.\n", "  A simple circuit implementation of the oracle for Grover's quantum search of\na real unstructured classical database is proposed. The oracle contains a kind\nof quantumly accessible classical memory, which stores the database.\n", "  In a recent paper Griffiths [38] has argued, based on the consistent\nhistories interpretation, that Hilbert space quantum mechanics (QM) is\nnoncontextual. According to Griffiths the problem of contextuality disappears\nif the apparatus is \"designed and operated by a competent experimentalist\" and\nwe accept the Single Framework Rule (SFR). We will argue from a\nrepresentational realist stance that the conclusion is incorrect due to the\nmisleading understanding provided by Griffiths to the meaning of quantum\ncontextuality and its relation to physical reality and measurements. We will\ndiscuss how the quite general incomprehension of contextuality has its origin\nin the \"objective-subjective omelette\" created by Heisenberg and Bohr. We will\nargue that in order to unscramble the omelette we need to disentangle, firstly,\nrepresentational realism from naive realism, secondly, ontology from\nepistemology, and thirdly, the different interpretational problems of QM. In\nthis respect, we will analyze what should be considered as Meaningful Physical\nStatements (MPS) within a theory and will argue that Counterfactual Reasoning\n(CR) -considered by Griffiths as \"tricky\"- must be accepted as a necessary\ncondition for any representational realist interpretation of QM. Finally we\ndiscuss what should be considered as a problem (and what not) in QM from a\nrepresentational realist perspective.\n", "  Liquid water can become metastable with respect to its vapor in hydrophobic\nconfinement. The resulting dewetting transitions are often impeded by large\nkinetic barriers. According to macroscopic theory, such barriers arise from the\nfree energy required to nucleate a critical vapor tube that spans the region\nbetween two hydrophobic surfaces - tubes with smaller radii collapse, whereas\nlarger ones grow to dry the entire confined region. Using extensive molecular\nsimulations of water between two nanoscopic hydrophobic surfaces, in\nconjunction with advanced sampling techniques, here we show that for\ninter-surface separations that thermodynamically favor dewetting, the barrier\nto dewetting does not correspond to the formation of a (classical) critical\nvapor tube. Instead, it corresponds to an abrupt transition from an isolated\ncavity adjacent to one of the confining surfaces to a gap-spanning vapor tube\nthat is already larger than the critical vapor tube anticipated by macroscopic\ntheory. Correspondingly, the barrier to dewetting is also smaller than the\nclassical expectation. We show that the peculiar nature of water density\nfluctuations adjacent to extended hydrophobic surfaces - namely, the enhanced\nlikelihood of observing low-density fluctuations relative to Gaussian\nstatistics - facilitates this non-classical behavior. By stabilizing isolated\ncavities relative to vapor tubes, enhanced water density fluctuations thus\nstabilize novel pathways, which circumvent the classical barriers and offer\ndiminished resistance to dewetting. Our results thus suggest a key role for\nfluctuations in speeding up the kinetics of numerous phenomena ranging from\nCassie-Wenzel transitions on superhydrophobic surfaces, to\nhydrophobically-driven biomolecular folding and assembly.\n", "  The possible role of growing static order in the dynamical slowing down\ntowards the glass transition has recently attracted considerable attention. On\nthe basis of random first-order transition (RFOT) theory, a new method to\nmeasure the static correlation length of amorphous order, called \"point-to-set\n(PTS)\" length, has been proposed, and used to show that the dynamic length\ngrows much faster than the static length. Here we study the nature of the PTS\nlength, using a polydisperse hard disk system, which is a model that is known\nto exhibit a growing hexatic order upon densification. We show that the PTS\ncorrelation length is decoupled from the steeper increase of the correlation\nlength of hexatic order, while closely mirroring the decay length of two-body\ndensity correlations. Our results thus provide a clear example that other forms\nof order can play an important role in the slowing down of the dynamics,\ncasting a serious doubt on the order agnostic nature of the PTS length and its\nrelevance to slow dynamics, provided that a polydisperse hard disk system is a\ntypical glass former.\n", "  We derive the key expressions to robustly address the eigenfunction\nexpansion-based analysis of electromagnetic (EM) fields produced by current\nsources within planar non-birefringent anisotropic medium (NBAM) layers. In\nNBAM, the highly symmetric permeability and permittivity tensors can induce\ndirectionally-dependent, but polarization independent, propagation properties\nsupporting \"degenerate\" characteristic polarizations, i.e. four\nlinearly-independent eigenvectors associated with only two (rather than four)\nunique, non-defective eigenvalues. We first explain problems that can arise\nwhen the source(s) specifically reside within NBAM planar layers when using\ncanonical field expressions. To remedy these problems, we exhibit alternative\nspectral-domain field expressions, immune to such problems, that form the\nfoundation for a robust eigenfunction expansion-based analysis of time-harmonic\nEM radiation and scattering within such type of planar-layered media. Numerical\nresults demonstrate the high accuracy and stability achievable using this\nalgorithm.\n", "  Tunnel ionization belongs to the fundamental processes of atomic physics. The\nso-called two-step model, which describes the ionization as instantaneous\ntunneling at the electric field maximum and classical motion afterwards with\nzero exit momentum, is commonly employed to describe tunnel ionization in\nadiabatic regimes. In this contribution, we show by solving numerically the\ntime-dependent Schr\\\"odinger equation in one dimension and employing a virtual\ndetector at the tunnel exit that there is a nonvanishing positive time delay\nbetween the electric field maximum and the instant of ionization. Moreover, we\nfind a nonzero exit momentum in the direction of the electric field. To extract\nproper tunneling times from asymptotic momentum distributions of ionized\nelectrons, it is essential to incorporate the electron's initial momentum in\nthe direction of the external electric field.\n", "  We report neutron scattering measurements, which reveal spin-liquid\npolymorphism in a '11' iron chalcogenide superconductor, a poorly-metallic\nmagnetic FeTe tuned towards superconductivity by substitution of a small amount\nof Tellurium with iso-electronic Sulphur. We observe liquid-like magnetic\ndynamics, which is described by a competition of two phases with different\nlocal structure, whose relative abundance depends on temperature. One is the\nferromagnetic (FM) plaquette phase observed in the non-superconducting FeTe,\nwhich preserves the C$_4$ symmetry of the underlying square lattice and is\nfavored at high temperatures. The other is the antiferromagnetic plaquette\nphase with broken C$_4$ symmetry, which emerges with doping and is predominant\nat low temperatures. These findings suggest a first-order liquid-liquid phase\ntransition in the electronic spin system of FeTe$_{1-x}$(S,Se)$_x$. We thus\ndiscover remarkable new physics of competing spin liquid polymorphs in a\ncorrelated electron system approaching superconductivity. Our results\nfacilitate an understanding of large swaths of recent experimental data in\nunconventional superconductors.\n", "  We investigate the phase structure of two-color QCD at both real and\nimaginary chemical potentials mu, performing lattice simulations and analyzing\nthe data with the Polyakov-loop extended Nambu--Jona-Lasinio (PNJL) model.\nLattice QCD simulations are done on an 8^3 times 4 lattice with the\nclover-improved two-flavor Wilson fermion action and the renormalization-group\nimproved Iwasaki gauge action. We test the analytic continuation of physical\nquantities from imaginary mu to real mu by comparing lattice QCD results\ncalculated at real mu with the result of analytic function the coefficients of\nwhich are determined from lattice QCD results at imaginary mu. We also test the\nvalidity of the PNJL model by comparing model results with lattice QCD ones.\nThe PNJL model is good in the deconfinement region, but less accurate in the\ntransition and confinement regions. This problem is improved by introducing the\nbaryon degree of freedom to the model. It is also found that the vector-type\nfour-quark interaction is necessary to explain lattice data on the quark number\ndensity.\n", "  A return probability of random walks is one of the interesting subjects. As\nit is well known, the return probability strongly depends on the structure of\nthe space where the random waker moves. On the other hand, the return\nprobability of quantum walks, which are quantum models corresponding to random\nwalks, has also been investigated to some extend lately. In this paper, we\npresent a limit of the return probability for a discrete-time 3-state quantum\nwalk on a hexagonal lattice.\n", "  We evaluate the Majorana phases for a general $3\\times3$ complex symmetric\nneutrino mass matrix on the basis of Mohapatra-Rodejohann's phase convention\nusing the three rephasing invariant quantities $I_{12}$, $I_{13}$ and $I_{23}$\nproposed by Sarkar and Singh. We find them interesting as they allow us to\nevaluate each Majorana phase in a model independent way even if one eigenvalue\nis zero. Utilizing the solution of a general complex symmetric mass matrix for\neigenvalues and mixing angles we determine the Majorana phases for both the\nhierarchies, normal and inverted, taking into account the constraints from\nneutrino oscillation global fit data as well as bound on the sum of the three\nlight neutrino masses ($\\Sigma_im_i$) and the neutrinoless double beta decay\n($\\beta\\beta_{0\\nu}$) parameter $|m_{11}|$. This methodology of finding the\nMajorana phases is applied thereafter in some predictive models for both the\nhierarchical cases (normal and inverted) to evaluate the corresponding Majorana\nphases and it is shown that all the sub cases presented in inverted hierarchy\nsection can be realized in a model with texture zeros and scaling ansatz within\nthe framework of inverse seesaw although one of the sub case following the\nnormal hierarchy is yet to be established. Except the case of quasi degenerate\nneutrinos, the methodology obtained in this work is able to evaluate the\ncorresponding Majorana phases, given any model of neutrino masses.\n", "  Modern technology unintentionally provides resources that enable the trust of\neveryday interactions to be undermined. Some authentication schemes address\nthis issue using devices that give unique outputs in response to a challenge.\nThese signatures are generated by hard-to-predict physical responses derived\nfrom structural characteristics, which lend themselves to two different\narchitectures, known as unique objects (UNOs) and physically unclonable\nfunctions (PUFs). The classical design of UNOs and PUFs limits their size and,\nin some cases, their security. Here we show that quantum confinement lends\nitself to the provision of unique identities at the nanoscale, by using\nfluctuations in tunnelling measurements through quantum wells in resonant\ntunnelling diodes (RTDs). This provides an uncomplicated measurement of\nidentity without conventional resource limitations whilst providing robust\nsecurity. The confined energy levels are highly sensitive to the specific\nnanostructure within each RTD, resulting in a distinct tunnelling spectrum for\nevery device, as they contain a unique and unpredictable structure that is\npresently impossible to clone. This new class of authentication device operates\nwith few resources in simple electronic structures above room temperature.\n", "  Motivated by a recently found class of AdS_7 solutions, we classify AdS_5\nsolutions in massive IIA, finding infinitely many new analytical examples. We\nreduce the general problem to a set of PDEs, determining the local internal\nmetric, which is a fibration over a surface. Under a certain simplifying\nassumption, we are then able to analytically solve the PDEs and give a complete\nlist of all solutions. Among these, one class is new and regular. These spaces\ncan be related to the AdS_7 solutions via a simple universal map for the\nmetric, dilaton and fluxes. The natural interpretation of this map is that the\ndual CFT_6 and CFT_4 are related by twisted compactification on a Riemann\nsurface $\\Sigma_g$. The ratio of their free energy coefficients is proportional\nto the Euler characteristic of $\\Sigma_g$. As a byproduct, we also find the\nanalytic expression for the AdS_7 solutions, which were previously known only\nnumerically. We determine the free energy for simple examples: it is a simple\ncubic function of the flux integers.\n", "  We show how recent progress in computing elliptic genera of strings in six\ndimensions can be used to obtain expressions for elliptic genera of strings in\nfive-dimensional field theories which have a six-dimensional parent. We further\nconnect our results to recent mathematical results about sheaf counting on\nruled surfaces.\n", "  We address dissipation effects on the non-equilibrium quantum dynamics of an\nensemble of spins-1/2 coupled via an Ising interaction. Dissipation is modeled\nby a (ohmic) bath of harmonic oscillators at zero temperature and correspond\neither to the sound modes of a one-dimensional Bose-Einstein (quasi-)condensate\nor to the zero-point fluctuations of a long transmission line. We consider the\ndimer comprising two spins and the quantum Ising chain with long-range\ninteractions, and develop a (mathematically and numerically) exact stochastic\napproach to address non-equilibrium protocols in the presence of an\nenvironment. For the two spin case, we first investigate the dissipative\nquantum phase transition induced by the environment through quantum quenches,\nand study the effect of the environment on the synchronization properties.\nThen, we address Landau-Zener-Stueckelberg-Majorana protocols for two spins,\nand for the spin array. In this latter case, we adopt a stochastic mean-field\npoint of view and present a Kibble-Zurek type argument to account for\ninteraction effects in the lattice. Such dissipative quantum spin arrays can be\nrealized in ultra-cold atoms, trapped ions, mesoscopic systems, and are related\nto Kondo lattice models.\n", "  In pursuit of creating cuprate-like electronic and orbital structures,\nartificial heterostructures based on LaNiO$_3$ have inspired a wealth of\nexciting experimental and theoretical results. However, to date there is a very\nlimited experimental understanding of the electronic and orbital states\nemerging after interfacial charge-transfer and their connections to the\nmodified band structure at the interface. Towards this goal, we have\nsynthesized a prototypical superlattice composed of correlated metal LaNiO$_3$\nand doped Mott insulator LaTiO$_{3+\\delta}$, and investigated its electronic\nstructure by resonant X-ray absorption spectroscopy combined with X-ray\nphotoemission spectroscopy, electrical transport and theory calculations. The\nheterostructure exhibits interfacial charge-transfer from Ti to Ni sites giving\nrise to an insulating ground state with orbital polarization and $e_\\textrm{g}$\norbital band splitting. Our findings demonstrate how the control over charge at\nthe interface can be effectively used to create exotic electronic, orbital and\nspin states.\n", "  Laboratory wave basin measurements of the surge, heave and pitch of a\nfloating plastic disk caused by regular incident waves are presented. The\nmeasurements are used to validate two theoretical models: one based on\nslope-sliding theory and the other on combined potential-flow and thin-plate\ntheories.\n", "  We present a calculation of exciton states in semiconductor coupled quantum\nwells (CQWs) in the presence of electric and magnetic fields applied\nperpendicular to the QW plane. The exciton Schr\\\"odinger equation is solved in\nreal space in three dimensions to obtain the Landau levels of both direct and\nindirect excitons. Calculation of the exciton energy levels and oscillator\nstrengths enables mapping of the electric and magnetic field dependence of the\nexciton absorption spectrum. For the ground state of the system, we evaluate\nthe Bohr radius, optical lifetime, binding energy and dipole moment. The\nexciton mass renormalization due to the magnetic field is calculated using a\nperturbative approach. We predict a non-monotonous dependence of the exciton\nground state effective mass on magnetic field. Such a trend is explained in a\nclassical picture, in terms of the ground state tending from an indirect to a\ndirect exciton with increasing magnetic field.\n", "  We describe propagation of torsional elastic waves in cylindrical waveguide\nwith wedge dislocation in the framework of geometric theory of defects. The\ndefect changes the dispersion relation. For positive deficit angles, it\nincreases the phase velocity, and decreases the group velocity of the wave.\n", "  We study the role of unsteady lift in the context of flapping wings in birds'\nflight. Both aerodynamicists and biologists attempt to address this subject,\nyet it seems that the contribution of the unsteady lift still holds many open\nquestions. The current study deals with the estimation of unsteady aerodynamic\nforces on a freely flying bird through analysis of wingbeat kinematics and near\nwake flow measurements using time resolved particle image velocimetry. The\naerodynamic forces are obtained through unsteady thin airfoil theory and lift\ncalculation using the momentum equation for viscous flows. The unsteady lift is\ncomprised of circulatory and non-circulatory components. Both are presented\nover wingbeat cycles. Using long sampling data, several wingbeat cycles have\nbeen analyzed in order to cover the downstroke and upstroke phases. It appears\nthat the lift varies over the wingbeat cycle emphasizing its contribution to\nthe total lift and its role in power estimations. It is suggested that the\ncirculatory lift component cannot assumed to be negligible and should be\nconsidered when estimating lift or power of birds in flapping motion.\n", "  We study the dynamic interactions and structural changes in global financial\nindices in the years 1998-2012. We apply a principal component analysis (PCA)\nto cross-correlation coefficients of the stock indices. We calculate the\ncorrelations between principal components (PCs) and each asset, known as PC\ncoefficients. A change in market state is identified as a change in the first\nPC coefficients. Some indices do not show significant change of PCs in market\nstate during crises. The indices exposed to the invested capitals in the stock\nmarkets are at the minimum level of risk. Using the first two PC coefficients,\nwe identify indices that are similar and more strongly correlated than the\nothers. We observe that the European indices form a robust group over the\nobservation period. The dynamics of the individual indices within the group\nincrease in similarity with time, and the dynamics of indices are more similar\nduring the crises. Furthermore, the group formation of indices changes position\nin two-dimensional spaces due to crises. Finally, after a financial crisis, the\ndifference of PCs between the European and American indices narrows.\n", "  We study a random logistic map $x_{t+1} = a_{t} x_{t}[1-x_{t}]$ where $a_t$\nare bounded ($q_1 \\leq a_t \\leq q_2$), random variables independently drawn\nfrom a distribution. $x_t$ does not show any regular behaviour in time. We find\nthat $x_t$ shows fully ergodic behaviour when the maximum allowed value of\n$a_t$ is $4$. However $< x_{t \\to \\infty}>$, averaged over different\nrealisations reaches a fixed point. For $1\\leq a_t \\leq 4$ the system shows\nnonchaotic behaviour and the Lyapunov exponent is strongly dependent on the\nasymmetry of the distribution from which $a_t$ is drawn. Chaotic behaviour is\nseen to occur beyond a threshold value of $q_1$ ($q_2$) when $q_2$ ($q_1$) is\nvaried. The most striking result is that the random map is chaotic even when\n$q_2$ is less than the threshold value $3.5699......$ at which chaos occurs in\nthe non random map. We also employ a different method in which a different set\nof random variables are used for the evolution of two initially identical $x$\nvalues, here the chaotic regime exists for all $q_1 \\neq q_2 $ values.\n", "  A zero temperature quench of the Ising model is known to lead to a frozen\nsteady state on random and small world networks. We study such quenches on\nrandom scale free networks (RSF) and compare the scenario with that in the\nBarab\\'asi-Albert network (BA) and the Watts Strogatz (WS) addition type\nnetwork. While frozen states are present in all the cases, the RSF shows an\norder-disorder phase transition of mean field nature as in the WS model as well\nas the existence of two absorbing phases separated by an active phase. The WS\nnetwork also shows an active-absorbing (A-A) phase transition occurring at the\nknown order-disorder transition point. The comparison of the RSF and the BA\nnetwork results show interesting difference in finite size dependence.\n", "  We study the scattering problem of photon and polariton in a one-dimensional\ncoupled-cavity system. Analytical approximate analysis and numerical simulation\nshow that a photon can stimulate the photon emission from a polariton through\npolariton-photon collisions. This observation opens the possibility of\nphoton-stimulated transition from insulating to radiative phase in a\ncoupled-cavity QED system. Inversely, we also find that a polariton can be\ngenerated by a two-photon Raman scattering process. This paves the way towards\nsingle photon storage by the aid of atom-cavity interaction.\n", "  Populations of species in ecosystems are often constrained by availability of\nresources within their environment. In effect this means that a growth of one\npopulation, needs to be balanced by comparable reduction in populations of\nothers. In neutral models of biodiversity all populations are assumed to change\nincrementally due to stochastic births and deaths of individuals. Here we\npropose and model another redistribution mechanism driven by abrupt and severe\ncollapses of the entire population of a single species freeing up resources for\nthe remaining ones. This mechanism may be relevant e.g. for communities of\nbacteria, with strain-specific collapses caused e.g. by invading\nbacteriophages, or for other ecosystems where infectious diseases play an\nimportant role.\n  The emergent dynamics of our system is cyclic \"diversity waves\" triggered by\ncollapses of globally dominating populations. The population diversity peaks at\nthe beginning of each wave and exponentially decreases afterwards. Species\nabundances are characterized by a bimodal time-aggregated distribution with the\nlower peak formed by populations of recently collapsed or newly introduced\nspecies, while the upper peak - species that has not yet collapsed in the\ncurrent wave. In most waves both upper and lower peaks are composed of several\nsmaller peaks. This self-organized hierarchical peak structure has a long-term\nmemory transmitted across several waves. It gives rise to a scale-free tail of\nthe time-aggregated population distribution with a universal exponent of 1.7.\nWe show that diversity wave dynamics is robust with respect to variations in\nthe rules of our model such as diffusion between multiple environments,\nspecies-specific growth and extinction rates, and bet-hedging strategies.\n", "  The role played by baryonic resonances in the production of final states\ncontaining strangeness for proton-proton reactions at 3.5 GeV measured by HADES\nis discussed by means of several very different measurements. First the\nassociate production of $\\Delta$ resonances accompanying final states with\nstrange hadrons is presented, then the role of interferences among N$^*$\nresonances, as measured by HADES for the first time, is summarised. Last but\nnot least the role played by heavy resonances, with a mass larger than $2$\nGeV/c$^2$ in the production of strange and non-strange hadrons is discussed.\nExperimental evidence for the presence of a $\\Delta(2000)^{++}$ are presented\nand hypotheses are discussed employing the contribution of similar objects to\npopulate the excesses measured by HADES for the $\\Xi$ in A+A and p+A collisions\nand in the dilepton sector for A+A collisions. This extensive set of results\nhelps to better understand the dynamic underlaying particle production in\nelementary reactions and sets a more solid basis for the understanding of heavy\nion collisions at the same energies and even higher as planned at the FAIR\nfacility.\n", "  Optical absorption is omnipresent and very often distributed non-uniformly in\nspace. We present a numerical study on the effects of inhomogeneous absorption\non transmission eigenchannels of light in highly scattering media. In the weak\nabsorption regime, the spatial profile of a transmission channel remains very\nsimilar to that without absorption, and the effect of inhomogeneous absorption\ncan be stronger or weaker than homogeneous absorption depending on the spatial\noverlap of the localized absorbing region with the field intensity maximum of\nthe channel. In the strong absorption regime, the high transmission channels\nredirect the energy flows to circumvent the absorbing regions to minimize loss.\nThe attenuation of high transmission channels by inhomogeneous absorption is\nlower than that by homogeneous absorption, regardless of the location of the\nabsorbing region. The statistical distribution of transmission eigenvalues in\nthe former becomes broader than that in the latter, due to a longer tail at\nhigh transmission. Since the maximum transmission channel is the most efficient\nin bypassing the absorbing region, the ratio of its transmittance to the\naverage transmittance increases with absorption, eventually exceeds the ratio\nwithout absorption.\n", "  In this paper, a baseline model termed as random birth-and-death network\nmodel (RBDN) is considered, in which at each time step, a new node is added\ninto the network with probability p (0<p <1) connect it with m old nodes\nuniformly, or an existing node is deleted from the network with probability\nq=1-p. This model allows for fluctuations in size, which may reach many\ndifferent disciplines in physics, ecology and economics. The purpose of this\nstudy is to develop the RBDN model and explore its basic statistical\nproperties. For different p, we first discuss the network size of RBDN. And\nthen combining the stochastic process rules (SPR) based Markov chain method and\nthe probability generating function method, we provide the exact solutions of\nthe degree distributions. Finally, the characteristics of the tail of the\ndegree distributions are explored after simulation verification. Our results\nshow that the tail of the degree distribution for RBDN exhibits a Poisson tail\nin the case of 0<p<=1/2 and an exponential tail as p approaches to 1.\n", "  A new analogy between optical propagation and heat diffusion in heterogeneous\nanisotropic media has been proposed recently [S. Guenneau, C. Amra, and D.\nVeynante, Optics Express Vol. 20, 8207-8218 (2012)]. A detailed derivation of\nthis unconventional correspondence is presented and developed. In time harmonic\nregime, all thermal parameters are related to optical ones in artificial\nmetallic media, thus making possible to use numerical codes developed for\noptics. Then the optical admittance formalism is extended to heat conduction in\nmultilayered structures. The concepts of planar micro-cavities, diffraction\ngratings, and planar transformation optics for heat conduction are addressed.\nResults and limitations of the analogy are emphasized.\n", "  Collagen is the main structural and load-bearing element of various\nconnective tissues, where it forms the extracellular matrix that supports\ncells. It has long been known that collagenous tissues exhibit a highly\nnonlinear stress-strain relationship (Fung YC, Am J Physiol 213(6),1967;\nHumphrey JD, Proc R Soc Lond A: Math Phys Eng Sci 459(2029),2003), although the\norigins of this nonlinearity remain unknown (McMahon TA, Lec Math Life Sci\n13,1980). Here, we show that the nonlinear stiffening of reconstituted type I\ncollagen networks is controlled by the applied stress, and that the network\nstiffness becomes surprisingly insensitive to network concentration. We\ndemonstrate how a simple model for networks of elastic fibers can\nquantitatively account for the mechanics of reconstituted collagen networks.\nOur model points to the important role of normal stresses in determining the\nnonlinear shear elastic response, which can explain the approximate exponential\nrelationship between stress and strain reported for collagenous tissues (Fung\nYC, Am J Physiol 213(6),1967). This further suggests new principles for the\ndesign of synthetic fiber networks with collagen-like properties, as well as a\nmechanism for the control of the mechanics of such networks.\n", "  The investigation of contact symmetries of re--parametrization invariant\nLagrangians of finite degrees of freedom and quadratic in the velocities is\npresented. The main concern of the paper is those symmetry generators which\ndepend linearly in the velocities. A natural extension of the symmetry\ngenerator along the lapse function $N(t)$, with the appropriate extension of\nthe dependence in $\\dot{N}(t)$ of the gauge function, is assumed; this action\nyields new results. The central finding is that the integrals of motion are\neither linear or quadratic in velocities and are generated, respectively by the\nconformal Killing vector fields and the conformal Killing tensors of the\nconfiguration space metric deduced from the kinetic part of the Lagrangian\n(with appropriate conformal factors). The freedom of re--parametrization allows\none to appropriately scale $N(t)$, so that the potential becomes constant; in\nthis case the integrals of motion can be constructed from the Killing fields\nand Killing tensors of the scaled metric. A rather interesting result is the\nnon--necessity of the gauge function in Noether's theorem due to the presence\nof the Hamiltonian constraint\n", "  Tests of the universality of free fall and the weak equivalence principle\nprobe the foundations of General Relativity. Evidence of a violation may lead\nto the discovery of a new force. The best torsion balance experiments have\nruled it out to 10^-13. Cold-atom drop tests have reached 10^-7 and promise to\ndo 7 to 10 orders of magnitude better, on the ground or in space. They are\nlimited by the random shot noise, which depends on the number N of atoms in the\nclouds. As mass-dropping experiments in the non-uniform gravitational field of\nEarth, they are sensitive to the initial conditions. Random accelerations due\nto initial condition errors of the clouds are designed to be at the same level\nas shot noise, so that they can be reduced with the number of drops along with\nit. This sets the requirements for the initial position and velocity spreads of\nthe clouds with given N. In the STE-QUEST space mission proposal aiming at\n2x10^-15 they must be about a factor 8 above Heisenberg's principle limit, and\nthe integration time required to reduce both errors is 3 years, with a mission\nduration of 5 years. Instead, offset errors at release between different atom\nclouds are systematic and give rise to a systematic effect which mimics a\nviolation. Such offsets must be demonstrated to be as small as required in all\ndrops, must be small by design and must be measured. For STE-QUEST to meet its\ngoal they must be several orders of magnitude smaller than the size of each\nindividual cloud, which in its turn must be at most 8 times larger than the\nuncertainty principle limit. Even if all technical problems are solved and the\nclouds are released with negligible systematic errors, still they must be\nmeasured. Then, Heisenberg's principle dictates that the measurement lasts as\nlong as the experiment and the systematic nature of the effect requires many\nmeasurements for it to be ruled out as a source of violation.\n", "  We propose an extension of the Fokker-Planck model of the Boltzmann equation\nto get a correct Prandtl number in the Compressible Navier-Stokes asymptotics.\nThis is obtained by replacing the diffusion coefficient (which is the\nequilibrium temperature) by a non diagonal temperature tensor, like the\nEllipsoidal-Statistical model (ES) is obtained from the Bathnagar-Gross-Krook\nmodel (BGK) of the Boltzmann equation. Our model is proved to satisfy the\nproperties of conservation and a H-theorem. A Chapman-Enskog analysis and two\nnumerical tests show that a correct Prandtl number of 2/3 can be obtained.\n", "  Interpreting renormalization group flows as solitons interpolating between\ndifferent fixed points, we ask various questions that are normally asked in\nsoliton physics but not in renormalization theory. Can one count RG flows? Are\nthere different \"topological sectors\" for RG flows? What is the moduli space of\nan RG flow, and how does it compare to familiar moduli spaces of\n(supersymmetric) dowain walls? Analyzing these questions in a wide variety of\ncontexts --- from counting RG walls to AdS/CFT correspondence --- will not only\nprovide favorable answers, but will also lead us to a unified general framework\nthat is powerful enough to account for peculiar RG flows and predict new\nphysical phenomena. Namely, using Bott's version of Morse theory we relate the\ntopology of conformal manifolds to certain properties of RG flows that can be\nused as precise diagnostics and \"topological obstructions\" for the strong form\nof the C-theorem in any dimension. Moreover, this framework suggests a precise\nmechanism for how the violation of the strong C-theorem happens and predicts\n\"phase transitions\" along the RG flow when the topological obstruction is\nnon-trivial. Along the way, we also find new conformal manifolds in well-known\n4d CFT's and point out connections with the superconformal index and\nclassifying spaces of global symmetry groups.\n", "  Using molecular dynamics simulations, we investigate systematically the water\npermeation properties across the single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) in the\npresence of the terahertz electric field (TEF). With the TEF normal to the\nnanotube, the fracture of the hydrogen bonds results in the giant peak of net\nfluxes across the SWCNT with a three-fold enhancement centered around 14THz.\nThe phenomenon is attributed to the resonant mechanisms, characterized by\nlibrational, rotational, and rotation-induced responses of in-tube polar water\nmolecules to the TEF. For the TEF along the symmetry axis of the nanotube, the\nvortical modes for resonances and consequently the enhancement of net fluxes\nare greatly suppressed by the alignment of polar water along the symmetry axis,\nwhich characterizes the quasi one-dimensional feature of the SWCNT nicely. The\nresonances of water molecules in the TEF can have potential applications in the\nhigh-flux device designs used for various purposes.\n", "  The cytoplasm and biomembranes in biological cells contain large numbers of\nproteins that cyclically change their shapes. They are molecular machines that\ncan function as molecular motors or carry out many other tasks in the cell. We\nanalyze the effects that hydrodynamic flows induced by active proteins have on\nother passive molecules in solution or membranes. We show that the diffusion\nconstants of passive particles are enhanced substantially. Furthermore, when\ngradients of active proteins are present, a chemotaxis-like drift of passive\nparticles takes place. In lipid bilayers, the effects are strongly nonlocal, so\nthat active inclusions in the membrane contribute to diffusion enhancement and\nthe drift. The results indicate that the transport properties of passive\nparticles in systems containing active proteins machines operating under\nnonequilibrium conditions differ from their counterparts in systems at thermal\nequilibrium.\n", "  The Forward-Backward Asymmetry (AFB) in Z' physics is commonly only perceived\nas the observable which possibly allows one to interpret a Z' signal by\ndistinguishing different models of such (heavy) spin-1 bosons. In this paper,\nwe examine the potential of AFB in setting bounds on or even discovering a Z'\nboson at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and show that it might be a powerful\ntool for this purpose. We analyse two different scenarios: Z' bosons with a\nnarrow and wide width, respectively. We find that, in the first case, the\nsignificance of the AFB search can be comparable with that of the bump search\nusually adopted by the experimental collaborations; however, being a ratio of\n(differential) cross sections the AFB has the advantage of reducing\nsystematical errors. In the second case, the AFB search can win over the bump\nsearch in terms of event shape, as the structure of the AFB distribution as a\nfunction of the invariant mass of the reconstructed Z'boson could nail down the\nnew broad resonance much better than the event counting strategy usually\nadopted in such cases.\n", "  In the framework of semiclassical theory the universal properties of quantum\nsystems with classically chaotic dynamics can be accounted for through\ncorrelations between partner periodic orbits with small action differences. So\nfar, however, the scope of this approach has been mainly limited to systems of\na few particles with low-dimensional phase spaces. In the present work we\nconsider N-particle chaotic systems with local homogeneous interactions, where\nN is not necessarily small. Based on a model of coupled cat maps we demonstrate\nemergence of a new mechanism for correlation between periodic orbit actions. In\nparticular, we show the existence of partner orbits which are specific to\nmany-particle systems. For a sufficiently large N these new partners dominate\nthe spectrum of correlating periodic orbits and seem to be necessary for\nconstruction of a consistent many-particle semiclassical theory.\n", "  The framework of non-extensive statistical mechanics, proposed by Tsallis,\nhas been used to describe a variety of systems. The non-extensive statistical\nmechanics is usually introduced in a formal way, using the maximization of\nentropy. In this article we investigate the canonical ensemble in the\nnon-extensive statistical mechanics using a more traditional way, by\nconsidering a small system interacting with a large reservoir via short-range\nforces. The reservoir is characterized by generalized entropy instead of the\nBoltzmann-Gibbs entropy. Assuming equal probabilities for all available\nmicrostates we derive the equations of the non-extensive statistical mechanics.\nSuch a procedure can provide deeper insight into applicability of the\nnon-extensive statistics.\n", "  Even in simple geometries many complex fluids display non-trivial flow\nfields, with regions where shear is concentrated. The possibility for such\nshear banding has been known since several decades, but the recent years have\nseen an upsurge of studies offering an ever more precise understanding of the\nphenomenon. The development of new techniques to probe the flow on multiple\nscales and with increasing spatial and temporal resolution has opened the\npossibility for a synthesis of the many phenomena that could only have been\nthought of separately before. In this review, we bring together recent research\non shear banding in polymeric and on soft glassy materials, and highlight their\nsimilarities and disparities.\n", "  A 1D model is developed for defective gap mode (DGM) with two types of\nboundary conditions: conducting mesh and conducting sleeve. For a periodically\nmodulated system without defect, the normalized width of spectral gaps equals\nto the modulation factor, which is consistent with previous studies. For a\nperiodic system with local defects introduced by the boundary conditions, it\nshows that the conducting-mesh-induced DGM is always well confined by spectral\ngaps while the conducting-sleeve-induced DGM is not. The defect location can be\na useful tool to dynamically control the frequency and spatial periodicity of\nDGM inside spectral gaps. This controllability can be applied to optical\nmicrocavities and waveguides in photonic crystals and the interaction between\ngap eigenmodes and energetic particles in fusion plasmas.\n", "  We study the relation between the flux of a center vortex obtained from the\ncenter vortex model and the flux formed between monopoles obtained from the\nAbelian gauge fixing method. Motivated by the Monte Carlo simulations which\nhave shown that almost all monopoles are sitting on the top of vortices, we\nconstruct the fluxes of center vortices for $SU(2)$ and $SU(3)$ gauge groups\nusing fractional fluxes of monopoles. Then, we compute the potentials in the\nfundamental representation induced by center vortices and fractional fluxes of\nmonopoles. We show that by combining the fractional fluxes of monopoles one can\nproduce the center vortex fluxes for $SU(3)$ gauge group in a \"center vortex\nmodel\". Comparing the potentials, we conclude that the fractional fluxes of\nmonopoles attract each other.\n", "  We investigated the socioeconomic scaling behavior of all cities with more\nthan 50,000 inhabitants in the Netherlands and found significant superlinear\nscaling of gross urban product with population size. Of these cities, 22 major\ncities have urban agglomerations and urban areas defined by the Netherlands\nCentral Bureau of Statistics. For these major cities we investigated the\nsuperlinear scaling for three separate modalities: the cities defined as\nmunicipalities, their urban agglomerations and their urban areas. We find\nsuperlinearity with power-law exponents of around 1.15. But remarkably, both\ntypes of agglomerations underperform if we compare for the same size of\npopulation an agglomeration with a city as a municipality. In other words, an\nurban system as one formal municipality performs better as compared to an urban\nagglomeration with the same population size. This effect is larger for the\nsecond type of agglomerations, the urban areas. We think this finding has\nimportant implications for urban policy, in particular municipal\nreorganizations. A residual analysis suggests that cities with a municipal\nreorganization recently and in the past decades have a higher probability to\nperform better than cities without municipal restructuring.\n", "  We consider a mean-field Hamiltonian for a $d_{x^2-y^2}+(p+ip)$\nsuperconductor(SC) in presence of spin-density-wave(SDW) order. This is due to\nthe fact that the non-commutativity of any two orders produces the third one.\nThe energy spectrum of such a Hamiltonian is shown to be gapped and it yields a\ntopological phase in addition to the conventional one. A phase diagram\ncharacterizing different topological phases is construted. The Chern numbers\nand hence the nature of the topological phases are determined. The edge state\nspectrum and the possibility of whether the vortex state harbouring the zero\nmodes are discussed.\n", "  We present a method for computing the partition function of a caloron\nensemble taking into account the interaction of calorons. We focus on\ncaloron-Dirac string interaction and show that the metric that Diakonov and\nPetrov offered works well in the limit where this interaction occurs. We\nsuggest computing the correlation function of two polyakov loops by applying\nEwald's method.\n", "  We develop the model of the critical phenomena of strongly interacting matter\nat high temperatures and baryon densities. The dual Yang-Mills theory with\nscalar degrees of freedom (the dilatons) is used. The dilatons are the\nconsequence of a spontaneous breaking of a scale symmetry. The phase\ntransitions are considered in systems where the field conjugate to the order\nparameter has the critical end mode. The critical end point (CEP) is a distinct\nsingular feature existence of which is dictated by the chiral dynamics. The\nphysical realization of CEP is via the influence quantum fluctuations of\ntwo-body Bose-Einstein correlations for observed particles to which the\ncritical end mode couples.\n", "  Mechanical instability takes different forms in various ordered and\ndisordered systems. We study the effect of thermal fluctuations in two\ndisordered central-force lattice models near mechanical instability: randomly\ndiluted triangular lattice and randomly braced square lattice. These two\nlattices exhibit different scalings for the emergence of rigidity at $T=0$ due\nto their different patterns of self stress at the transition. Using analytic\ntheory we show that thermal fluctuations stabilize both lattices. In\nparticular, the triangular lattice displays a critical regime in which the\nshear modulus scales as $G \\sim T^{1/2}$, whereas the square lattice shows $G\n\\sim T^{2/3}$.\n", "  Efficient frequency conversion techniques are crucial to the development of\nplasmonic metasurfaces for information processing and signal modulation. In\nprinciple, nanoscale electric-field confinement in nonlinear materials enables\nhigher harmonic conversion efficiencies per unit volume than those attainable\nin bulk materials. Here we demonstrate efficient second-harmonic generation\n(SHG) in a serrated nanogap plasmonic geometry that generates steep electric\nfield gradients on a dielectric metasurface. An ultrafast pump is used to\ncontrol plasmon-induced electric fields in a thin-film material with inversion\nsymmetry that, without plasmonic enhancement, does not exhibit an an even-order\nnonlinear optical response. The temporal evolution of the plasmonic near-field\nis characterized with ~100as resolution using a novel nonlinear interferometric\ntechnique. The ability to manipulate nonlinear signals in a metamaterial\ngeometry as demonstrated here is indispensable both to understanding the\nultrafast nonlinear response of nanoscale materials, and to producing active,\noptically reconfigurable plasmonic devices\n", "  We present spin-independent and spin-spin interquark potentials for\ncharmonium states, that are calculated using a relativistic heavy quark action\nfor charm quarks on the PACS-CS gauge configurations generated with the Iwasaki\ngauge action and 2+1 flavors of Wilson clover quark. The interquark potential\nwith finite quark masses is defined through the equal-time Bethe-Salpeter\namplitude. The light and strange quark masses are close to the physical point\nwhere the pion mass corresponds to $M_\\pi \\approx 156(7)$ MeV, and charm quark\nmass is tuned to reproduce the experimental values of $\\eta_c$ and $J/\\psi$\nstates. Our simulations are performed with a lattice cutoff of $a^{-1}\\approx\n2.2$ GeV and a spatial volume of $(3 {\\rm fm})^3$. We solve the nonrelativistic\nSchr\\\"odinger equation with resulting charmonium potentials as theoretical\ninputs. The resultant charmonium spectrum below the open charm threshold shows\na fairly good agreement with experimental data of well-established charmonium\nstates.\n", "  In a world in which many pressing global issues require large scale\ncooperation, understanding the group size effect on cooperative behavior is a\ntopic of central importance. Yet, the nature of this effect remains largely\nunknown, with lab experiments insisting that it is either positive or negative\nor null, and field experiments suggesting that it is instead curvilinear. Here\nwe shed light on this apparent contradiction by considering a novel class of\npublic goods games inspired to the realistic scenario in which the natural\noutput limits of the public good imply that the benefit of cooperation\nincreases fast for early contributions and then decelerates. We report on a\nlarge lab experiment providing evidence that, in this case, group size has a\ncurvilinear effect on cooperation, according to which intermediate-size groups\ncooperate more than smaller groups and more than larger groups. In doing so,\nour findings help fill the gap between lab experiments and field experiments\nand suggest concrete ways to promote large scale cooperation among people.\n", "  We have simulated the formation of a galaxy cluster in a $\\Lambda$CDM\nuniverse using twelve different codes modeling only gravity and non-radiative\nhydrodynamics (\\art, \\arepo, \\hydra\\ and 9 incarnations of GADGET). This range\nof codes includes particle based, moving and fixed mesh codes as well as both\nEulerian and Lagrangian fluid schemes. The various GADGET implementations span\ntraditional and advanced smoothed-particle hydrodynamics (SPH) schemes. The\ngoal of this comparison is to assess the reliability of cosmological\nhydrodynamical simulations of clusters in the simplest astrophysically relevant\ncase, that in which the gas is assumed to be non-radiative. We compare images\nof the cluster at $z=0$, global properties such as mass, and radial profiles of\nvarious dynamical and thermodynamical quantities. The underlying gravitational\nframework can be aligned very accurately for all the codes allowing a detailed\ninvestigation of the differences that develop due to the various gas physics\nimplementations employed. As expected, the mesh-based codes ART and AREPO form\nextended entropy cores in the gas with rising central gas temperatures. Those\ncodes employing traditional SPH schemes show falling entropy profiles all the\nway into the very centre with correspondingly rising density profiles and\ncentral temperature inversions. We show that methods with modern SPH schemes\nthat allow entropy mixing span the range between these two extremes and the\nlatest SPH variants produce gas entropy profiles that are essentially\nindistinguishable from those obtained with grid based methods.\n", "  The launch of the gamma-ray telescope Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi-LAT)\nstarted a pivotal period in indirect detection of dark matter. By outperforming\nexpectations, for the first time a robust and stringent test of the paradigm of\nweakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) is within reach. In this paper, we\ndiscuss astrophysical targets for WIMP detection and the challenges they\npresent, review the analysis tools which have been employed to tackle these\nchallenges, and summarize the status of constraints on and the claimed\ndetections in the WIMP parameter space. Methods and results will be discussed\nin comparison to Imaging Air Cherenkov Telescopes. We also provide an outlook\non short term and longer term developments.\n", "  We present results on resistivity ($\\rho$), magnetization ($M$), thermal\nconductivity ($\\kappa$), magnetostriction ($\\frac{\\Delta L}{L(0)}$) and\nspecific heat ($C_{p}$) of charge-orbital ordered antiferromagnetic\nNd$_{0.8}$Na$_{0.2}$MnO$_{3}$ compound. Magnetic field-induced\nantiferromagnetic/charge-orbital ordered insulating to ferromagnetic metallic\ntransition leads to giant magnetothermal conductivity and magnetostriction\neffect. The low-temperature irreversibility behavior in $\\rho$, $M$, $\\kappa$\nand $\\frac{\\Delta L}{L(0)}$ due to field cycling together with striking\nsimilarity among the field and temperature dependence of these parameters\nmanifest the presence of strong and complex spin-charge-lattice coupling in\nthis compound. The giant magnetothermal conductivity is attributed mainly to\nthe suppression of phonon scattering due to the destabilization of spin\nfluctuations and static/dynamic Jahn-Teller distortion by the application of\nmagnetic field.\n", "  Stacking two-dimensional (2D) materials into multi-layers or\nheterostructures, known as van der Waals (vdW) epitaxy, is an essential degree\nof freedom for tuning their properties on demand. Few-layer black phosphorus\n(FLBP), a material with high potential for nano- and optoelectronics\napplications, appears to have interlayer couplings much stronger than graphene\nand other 2D systems. Indeed, these couplings call into question whether the\nstacking of FLBP can be governed only by vdW interactions, which is of crucial\nimportance for epitaxy and property refinement. Here, we perform a theoretical\ninvestigation of the vibrational properties of FLBP, which reflect directly its\ninterlayer coupling, by discussing six Raman-observable phonons, including\nthree optical, one breathing, and two shear modes. With increasing sample\nthickness, we find anomalous redshifts of the frequencies for each optical mode\nbut a blueshift for the armchair shear mode. Our calculations also show\nsplitting of the phonon branches, due to anomalous surface phenomena, and\nstrong phonon-phonon coupling. By computing uniaxial stress effects,\ninter-atomic force constants, and electron densities, we provide a compelling\ndemonstration that these properties are the consequence of strong and highly\ndirectional interlayer interactions arising from electronic hybridization of\nthe lone electron-pairs of FLBP, rather than from vdW interactions. This\nexceptional interlayer coupling mechanism controls the stacking stability of BP\nlayers and thus opens a new avenue beyond vdW epitaxy for understanding the\ndesign of 2D heterostructures.\n", "  We consider the hard-core model with Metropolis transition probabilities on\nfinite grid graphs and investigate the asymptotic behavior of the first hitting\ntime between its two maximum-occupancy configurations in the low-temperature\nregime. In particular, we show how the order-of-magnitude of this first hitting\ntime depends on the grid sizes and on the boundary conditions by means of a\nnovel combinatorial method. Our analysis also proves the asymptotic\nexponentiality of the scaled hitting time and yields the mixing time of the\nprocess in the low-temperature limit as side-result. In order to derive these\nresults, we extended the model-independent framework in [27] for first hitting\ntimes to allow for a more general initial state and target subset.\n", "  Engineering and studying few-electron states in ballistic conductors is a key\nstep towards understanding entanglement in quantum electronic systems. In this\nLetter, we introduce the intrinsic two-electron coherence of an electronic\nsource in quantum Hall edge channels and relate it to two-electron\nwavefunctions and to current noise in an Hanbury Brown--Twiss interferometer.\nInspired by the analogy with photon quantum optics, we propose to measure the\nintrinsic two-electron coherence of a source using low-frequency current\ncorrelation measurements at the output of a Franson interferometer. To\nillustrate this protocol, we discuss how it can distinguish between a time-bin\nentangled pure state and a statistical mixture of time shifted electron pairs.\n", "  A dodecagonal quasicrystal showing 12-fold symmetry forms in Mn-rich\nquaternary alloys containing 5.5 or 7.5 at.% Cr, 5.0 at.% Ni and 17.5 at.% Si.\nAfter annealing at 700 C for 130 h, the quasicrystal precipitated in a matrix\nof \\b{eta}-Mn type crystalline phase. The shape of the quasicrystal is\nneedle-like having a length of several tens of micrometers. Electron\ndiffraction as well as powder X-ray diffraction experiments have revealed the\nfollowing characteristics of the quasicrystal; diffraction symmetry 12/mmm,\npresence of systematic extinction for h1h2h2h1h5 type reflections with odd h5\nindex, and then five-dimensional space group P126/mmc. Indexing of the\nreflections indicated that the dimension of the common edge in the equilateral\ntriangle-square tiling is 4.560 {\\AA}, and the periodicity is 4.626 {\\AA} along\nthe 12-fold axis. This is the first example of the dodecagonal quasicrystal\nsynthesized by ordinary metallurgical method in 3-d transition-metal alloys.\n", "  We present a map of standard quantum mechanics onto a dual theory, that of\nthe classical thermodynamics of irreversible processes. While no gravity is\npresent in our construction, our map exhibits features that are reminiscent of\nthe holographic principle of quantum gravity.\n", "  We propose and implement a new method, called the Ice Sheet Coupled\nApproximation Levels (ISCAL) method, for simulation of ice sheet flow in large\ndomains under long time-intervals. The method couples the exact, full Stokes\n(FS) equations with the Shallow Ice Approximation (SIA). The part of the domain\nwhere SIA is applied is determined automatically and dynamically based on\nestimates of the modeling error. For a three dimensional model problem where\nthe number of degrees of freedom is comparable to a real world application,\nISCAL performs almost an order of magnitude faster with a low reduction in\naccuracy compared to a monolithic FS. Furthermore, ISCAL is shown to be able to\ndetect rapid dynamic changes in the flow. Three different error estimations are\napplied and compared. Finally, ISCAL is applied to the Greenland Ice Sheet,\nproving ISCAL to be a potential valuable tool for the ice sheet modeling\ncommunity.\n", "  How is online social media activity structured in the geographical space?\nRecent studies have shown that in spite of earlier visions about the \"death of\ndistance\", physical proximity is still a major factor in social tie formation\nand maintenance in virtual social networks. Yet, it is unclear, what are the\ncharacteristics of the distance dependence in online social networks. In order\nto explore this issue the complete network of the former major Hungarian online\nsocial network is analyzed. We find that the distance dependence is weaker for\nthe online social network ties than what was found earlier for phone\ncommunication networks. For a further analysis we introduced a coarser\ngranularity: We identified the settlements with the nodes of a network and\nassigned two kinds of weights to the links between them. When the weights are\nproportional to the number of contacts we observed weakly formed, but spatially\nbased modules resembling to the borders of macro-regions, the highest level of\nregional administration in the country. If the weights are defined relative to\nan uncorrelated null model, the next level of administrative regions, counties\nare reflected.\n", "  We use a regular arrangement of kirigami elements to demonstrate an inverse\ndesign paradigm for folding a flat surface into complex target configurations.\nWe first present a scheme using arrays of disclination defect pairs on the dual\nto the honeycomb lattice; by arranging these defect pairs properly with respect\nto each other and choosing an appropriate fold pattern a target stepped surface\ncan be designed. We then present a more general method that specifies a fixed\nlattice of kirigami cuts to be performed on a flat sheet. This single\n\"pluripotent\" lattice of cuts permits a wide variety of target surfaces to be\nprogrammed into the sheet by changing the folding directions.\n", "  Numerous applications all the way from biology and physics to economics\ndepend on the density of first crossings over a boundary. Motivated by the lack\nof analytical tools for computing first-passage time densities (FPTDs) for\ncomplex problems, we propose a new simple method based on the Independent\nInterval Approximation (IIA). We generalise previous formulations of the IIA to\nhandle non-smooth processes, and derive a closed form expression for the FPTD\nin Laplace and $z$-transform space for arbitrary boundary and starting points\nin one dimension. We focus on Markov processes for which the IIA is exact. To\napply our equations, we calculate the FPTD in two cases: the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck\nprocess and the discrete time Brownian walk. Our results are in good agreement\nwith Langevin dynamics simulations.\n", "  In this letter we derive a new method for direct calculation of the modal\ncontributions to thermal conductivity, which is termed Green-Kubo modal\nanalysis (GKMA). The GKMA method combines the lattice dynamics formalism with\nthe Green-Kubo formula for thermal conductivity, such that the thermal\nconductivity becomes a direct summation of modal contributions, where one need\nnot define the phonon velocity. As a result the GKMA method can be applied to\nany material/group of atoms where the atoms vibrate around stable equilibrium\npositions, which includes not only crystalline line compounds, but also random\nalloys, amorphous materials and even molecules. The GKMA method provides new\ninsight into the nature of phonon transport, as it casts the problem in terms\nof mode-mode correlation instead of scattering, and provides a general unified\nformalism that can be used to understand phonon-phonon interactions in\nessentially any class of materials or structures where the atoms vibrate around\nstable equilibrium sites.\n", "  Electron group velocity for graphene under uniform strain is obtained\nanalitically by using the Tight-Binding approx- imation. Such closed analytical\nexpressions are useful in order to calculate electronic, thermal and optical\nproperties of strained graphene. These results allow to understand the behavior\nof electrons when graphene is subjected to strong strain and nonlinear\ncorrections, for which the usual Dirac approach is not longer valid. Some\nparticular cases of uni- axial and shear strain were analized. The evolution of\nthe electron group velocity indicates a break up of the trigonal warping\nsymmetry, which is replaced by a warping consistent with the symmetry of the\nstrained reciprocal lattice. The Fermi velocity becomes strongly anisotropic,\ni.e, for a strong pure shear-strain (20% of the lattice parameter), the two\ninequivalent Dirac cones merge and the Fermi velocity is zero in one of the\nprincipal axis of deformation. We found that non-linear terms are essential to\ndescribe the effects of deformation for electrons near or at the Fermi energy.\n", "  The structures of the recently reported ordered perovskites SrLa(FeTi)O6 and\nBaLa(FeTi)O6 have been revisited using Rietveld analysis of the powder x-ray\ndiffraction data. Our studies clearly show that earlier authors have\nincorrectly reported the tetragonal structure in the I4/m space group for\nSrLa(FeTi)O6 and the cubic structure in the Fm3m space group for BaLa(FeTi)O6.\nThe correct structure is found to be orthorhombic in the Pnma space group for\nSrLa(FeTi)O6 while cubic in the Pm3m space group for BaLa(FeTi)O6. Thus the\nBaLa(FeTi)O6 is not an ordered double perovskite as the occupancies of Ba/La\nions at A-site and Fe/Ti ions at B-site are disordered resulting in the\nprimitive cubic unit cell in the Pm3m space group. Similarly, the occupancies\nof Sr/La ions at A-site and Fe/Ti ions at B-site are disordered in SrLa(FeTi)O6\nalso, ruling out the ordered perovskite structure.\n", "  An explicit determination of all local conservation laws of kinematic type on\nmoving domains and moving surfaces is presented for the Euler equations of\ninviscid compressible fluid flow on curved Riemannian manifolds in n>1\ndimensions. All corresponding kinematic constants of motion are also\ndetermined, along with all Hamiltonian kinematic symmetries and kinematic\nCasimirs which arise from the Hamiltonian structure of the inviscid\ncompressible fluid equations.\n", "  We present results of the clustering analysis between active galactic nuclei\n(AGNs) and galaxies at redshift 0.1-1.0 for investigating properties of\ngalaxies associated with the AGNs, revealing the nature of fueling mechanism of\nsupermassive black holes (SMBHs). We used 8059 SDSS AGNs/QSOs for which virial\nmasses of individual SMBHs were measured, and divided them into four mass\ngroups. Cross-correlation analysis was performed and bias for each mass group\nwas derived. The averaged color and luminosity distributions of galaxies around\nthe AGNs/QSOs were also derived for each mass group. The galaxy color was\nestimated for SED constructed from a merged SDSS and UKIDSS catalog. The\ndistributions of color and luminosity were derived by the subtraction method,\nwhich does not require redshift information of galaxies. The main results of\nthis work are: (1) a bias increases by a factor two from the lower mass group\nto the highest mass group; (2) the environment around AGNs with the most\nmassive SMBH (Mbh > 10^9 Msun) is dominated by red sequence galaxies; (3)\nmarginal indication of decline in luminosity function at dimmer side of M >\n-19.5 mag is found for galaxies around AGNs with Mbh = 10^8.2 - 10^9 Msun and\nnearest redshift group (z=0.1-0.3). These results indicate that AGNs with the\nmost massive SMBHs reside in haloes where large fraction of galaxies have been\ntransited to the red sequence. The accretion of hot halo gas as well as\nrecycled gas from evolving stars can be the most plausible mechanism to fuel\nthe SMBHs above ~10^9 Msun.\n", "  The fluctuations in wind power entering an electrical grid (Irish grid) were\nanalyzed and found to exhibit correlated fluctuations with a self-similar\nstructure, a signature of large-scale correlations in atmospheric turbulence.\nThe statistical structure of temporal correlations for fluctuations in\ngenerated and forecast time series was used to quantify two types of forecast\nerror: a timescale error ($e_{\\tau}$) that quantifies the deviations between\nthe high frequency components of the forecast and the generated time series,\nand a scaling error ($e_{\\zeta}$) that quantifies the degree to which the\nmodels fail to predict temporal correlations in the fluctuations of the\ngenerated power. With no $a$ $priori$ knowledge of the forecast models, we\nsuggest a simple memory kernel that reduces both the timescale error\n($e_{\\tau}$) and the scaling error ($e_{\\zeta}$).\n", "  What are the constraints placed on the frequency dependent constitutive\ntensors of elastodynamics by the requirements that the linear elastodynamic\nsystem under consideration be both causal (effects succeed causes) and passive\n(system doesn't produce energy)? Compared to electromagnetism, elastodynamics\nis complicated by its generally non diagonalizable constitutive tensors. In\nthis paper we clarify the constraints that causality and passivity place on\nvery general forms of elastodynamic constitutive relations. Specifically we\nshow that the satisfaction of passivity (and causality) directly requires that\nthe hermitian parts, as defined later, of the Fourier transforms of the time\nderivatives of the elastodynamic constitutive tensors be positive semi-definite\nat all frequencies. Additionally, we show that the conditions subsequently\nrequire that the non-hermitian parts of the Fourier transforms of the\nconstitutive tensors, when divided by the imaginary number $i$, be positive\nsemi-definite for positive values of frequency and negative semi-definite for\nnegative values of frequency. We show that when major symmetries are assumed\nthese definiteness relations apply simply to the real and imaginary parts of\nthe relevant tensors. For diagonal and one-dimensional problems, these positive\nsemi-definiteness relationships reduce to simple inequality relations. Finally\nwe extend the results to highly general constitutive relations which include\nthe Willis inhomogeneous relations as a special case.\n", "  The controllability of a network is a theoretical problem of relevance in a\nvariety of contexts ranging from financial markets to the brain. Until now,\nnetwork controllability has been characterized only on isolated networks, while\nthe vast majority of complex systems are formed by multilayer networks. Here we\nbuild a theoretical framework for the linear controllability of multilayer\nnetworks by mapping the problem into a combinatorial matching problem. We found\nthat correlating the external signals in the different layers can significantly\nreduce the multiplex network robustness to node removal, as it can be seen in\nconjunction with a hybrid phase transition occurring in interacting Poisson\nnetworks. Moreover we observe that multilayer networks can stabilize the fully\ncontrollable multiplex network configuration that can be stable also when the\nfull controllability of the single network is not stable.\n", "  We investigate theoretically the quantum oscillator-like states recently\nobserved experimentally in polariton condensates (Nat. Phys. 8, 190 (2012)). We\nconsider a complex Gross-Pitaevskii type model which includes the effects of\nself-interactions, and creation and decay of exciton-polaritons. We develop a\nperturbation theory for approximate solutions to this non-equilibrium\ncondensate model and compare the results with numerically calculated solutions\nfor both repulsive and attractive polariton-polariton interactions. While the\nnonlinearity has a weak effect on the mode selection their density profiles are\nmodified at moderate gain strengths and becomes more dominant when a very large\ngain of polaritons implies an extended cloud with high condensate densities.\nFinally, we identify the relation of the observed patterns to the input pump\nconfiguration, and suggest this may serve as a generalized NOR gate in the\ntradition of optical computing.\n", "  In this paper, we construct Liouville Quantum Field Theory (LQFT) on the\ntoroidal topology in the spirit of the 1981 seminal work by Polyakov. Our\napproach follows the construction carried out by the authors together with A.\nKupiainen in the case of the Riemann sphere. The difference is here that the\nmoduli space for complex tori is non trivial. Modular properties of LQFT are\nthus investigated. This allows us to sum up the LQFT on complex tori over the\nmoduli space, to compute the law of the random Liouville modulus, therefore\nrecovering (and extending) formulae obtained by physicists, and make\nconjectures about the relationship with random planar maps of genus one,\neventually weighted by a conformal field theory and conformally embedded onto\nthe torus.\n", "  We study an unsteady non linear fluid-structure interaction problem which is\na simplified model to describe blood flow through viscoleastic arteries. We\nconsider a Newtonian incompressible two-dimensional flow described by the\nNavier-Stokes equations set in an unknown domain depending on the displacement\nof a structure, which itself satisfies a linear viscoelastic beam equation. The\nfluid and the structure are fully coupled via interface conditions prescribing\nthe continuity of the velocities at the fluid-structure interface and the\naction-reaction principle. We prove that strong solutions to this problem are\nglobal-in-time. We obtain in particular that contact between the viscoleastic\nwall and the bottom of the fluid cavity does not occur in finite time. To our\nknowledge, this is the first occurrence of a no-contact result, but also of\nexistence of strong solutions globally in time, in the frame of interactions\nbetween a viscous fluid and a deformable structure.\n", "  Spin-orbit effects [1-4] have the potential of radically changing the field\nof spintronics by allowing transfer of spin angular momentum to a whole new\nclass of materials. In a seminal letter to Nature [5], Kajiwara et al. showed\nthat by depositing Platinum (Pt, a normal metal) on top of a 1.3 $\\mu$m thick\nYttrium Iron Garnet (YIG, a magnetic insulator), one could effectively transfer\nspin angular momentum through the interface between these two different\nmaterials. The outstanding feature was the detection of auto-oscillation of the\nYIG when enough dc current was passed in the Pt. This finding has created a\ngreat excitement in the community for two reasons: first, one could control\nelectronically the damping of insulators, which can offer improved properties\ncompared to metals, and here YIG has the lowest damping known in nature;\nsecond, the damping compensation could be achieved on very large objects, a\nparticularly relevant point for the field of magnonics [6,7] whose aim is to\nuse spin-waves as carriers of information. However, the degree of coherence of\nthe observed auto-oscillations has not been addressed in ref. [5]. In this\nwork, we emphasize the key role of quasi-degenerate spin-wave modes, which\nincrease the threshold current. This requires to reduce both the thickness and\nlateral size in order to reach full damping compensation [8] , and we show\nclear evidence of coherent spin-orbit torque induced auto-oscillation in\nmicron-sized YIG discs of thickness 20 nm.\n", "  We analyse the divergences of the three-loop partition function at fixed area\nin 2D quantum gravity. Considering the Liouville action in the Kahler\nformalism, we extract the coefficient of the leading divergence in $\\sim\nA\\Lambda^2 (\\ln A\\Lambda^2)^2$. This coefficient is non-vanishing. We discuss\nthe counterterms one can and must add and compute their precise contribution to\nthe partition function. This allows us to conclude that every local and\nnon-local divergence in the partition function can be balanced by local\ncounterterms, with the only exception of the maximally non-local divergence\n$(\\ln A\\Lambda^2)^3$. Yet, this latter is computed and does cancel between the\ndifferent three-loop diagrams. Thus, requiring locality of the counterterms is\nenough to renormalize the partition function. Finally, the structure of the new\ncounterterms strongly suggests that they can be understood as a renormalization\nof the measure action.\n", "  Important but rare and subtle processes driving galaxy morphology and\nstar-formation may be missed by traditional spiral, elliptical, irregular or\nS\\'ersic bulge/disk classifications. To overcome this limitation, we use a\nprincipal component analysis of non-parametric morphological indicators\n(concentration, asymmetry, Gini coefficient, $M_{20}$, multi-mode, intensity\nand deviation) measured at rest-frame $B$-band (corresponding to HST/WFC3 F125W\nat 1.4 $< z <$ 2) to trace the natural distribution of massive ($>10^{10}\nM_{\\odot}$) galaxy morphologies. Principal component analysis (PCA) quantifies\nthe correlations between these morphological indicators and determines the\nrelative importance of each. The first three principal components (PCs) capture\n$\\sim$75 per cent of the variance inherent to our sample. We interpret the\nfirst principal component (PC) as bulge strength, the second PC as dominated by\nconcentration and the third PC as dominated by asymmetry. Both PC1 and PC2\ncorrelate with the visual appearance of a central bulge and predict galaxy\nquiescence. PC1 is a better predictor of quenching than stellar mass, as as\ngood as other structural indicators (S\\'ersic-n or compactness). We divide the\nPCA results into groups using an agglomerative hierarchical clustering method.\nUnlike S\\'ersic, this classification scheme separates compact galaxies from\nlarger, smooth proto-elliptical systems, and star-forming disk-dominated clumpy\ngalaxies from star-forming bulge-dominated asymmetric galaxies. Distinguishing\nbetween these galaxy structural types in a quantitative manner is an important\nstep towards understanding the connections between morphology, galaxy assembly\nand star-formation.\n", "  Compared with introductory physics, relatively little is known about the\ndevelopment of expertise in advanced physics courses, especially in the case of\nquantum mechanics. Here, we describe a framework for understanding the patterns\nof student reasoning difficulties and how students develop expertise in quantum\nmechanics. The framework posits that the challenges many students face in\ndeveloping expertise in quantum mechanics are analogous to the challenges\nintroductory students face in developing expertise in introductory classical\nmechanics. This framework incorporates both the diversity in upper-level\nstudents' prior preparation, goals, and motivation in general (i.e., the facts\nthat even in upper-level courses, students may be inadequately prepared, have\nunclear goals, and have insufficient motivation to excel) as well as the\n\"paradigm shift\" from classical mechanics to quantum mechanics. The framework\nis based on empirical investigations demonstrating that the patterns of\nreasoning, problem-solving, and self-monitoring difficulties in quantum\nmechanics bear a striking resemblance to those found in introductory classical\nmechanics. Examples from research in quantum mechanics and introductory\nclassical mechanics are discussed to illustrate how the patterns of\ndifficulties are analogous as students learn to unpack the respective\nprinciples and grasp the formalism in each knowledge domain during the\ndevelopment of expertise. Embracing such a framework and contemplating the\nparallels between the difficulties in these two knowledge domains can enable\nresearchers to leverage the extensive literature for introductory physics\neducation research to guide the design of teaching and learning tools for\nhelping students develop expertise in quantum mechanics.\n", "  Learning advanced physics, in general, is challenging not only due to the\nincreased mathematical sophistication but also because one must continue to\nbuild on all of the prior knowledge acquired at the introductory and\nintermediate levels. In addition, learning quantum mechanics can be especially\nchallenging because the paradigms of classical mechanics and quantum mechanics\nare very different. Here, we review research on student reasoning difficulties\nin learning upper-level quantum mechanics and research on students'\nproblem-solving and metacognitive skills in these courses. Some of these\nstudies were multi-university investigations. The investigations suggest that\nthere is large diversity in student performance in upper-level quantum\nmechanics regardless of the university, textbook, or instructor and many\nstudents in these courses have not acquired a functional understanding of the\nfundamental concepts. The nature of reasoning difficulties in learning quantum\nmechanics is analogous to reasoning difficulties found via research in\nintroductory physics courses. The reasoning difficulties were often due to\nover-generalizations of concepts learned in one context to another context\nwhere they are not directly applicable. Reasoning difficulties in\ndistinguishing between closely related concepts and in making sense of the\nformalism of quantum mechanics were common. We conclude with a brief summary of\nthe research-based approached that take advantage of research on student\ndifficulties in order to improve teaching and learning of quantum mechanics.\n", "  We present analytic force-free solutions modeling rotating stars and black\nholes immersed in the magnetic field of a thin disk that terminates at an inner\nradius. The solutions are exact in flat spacetime and approximate in Kerr\nspacetime. The compact object produces a conical jet whose properties carry\ninformation about its nature. For example, the jet from a star is surrounded by\na current sheet, while that of a black hole is smooth. We compute an effective\nresistance in each case and compare to the canonical values used in circuit\nmodels of energy extraction. These solutions illustrate all of the basic\nfeatures of the Blandford-Znajek process for energy extraction and jet\nformation in a clean setting.\n", "  Gel electrophoresis is a powerful experimental method to probe the topology\nof DNA and other biopolymers. While there is a large body of experimental work\nwhich allows us to accurately separate different topoisomers of a molecule, a\nfull theoretical understanding of these experiments has not yet been achieved.\nHere we show that the mobility of DNA knots depends crucially and subtly on the\nphysical properties of the gel, and in particular on the presence of dangling\nends. The topological interactions between these and DNA molecules can be\ndescribed in terms of an \"entanglement number\", and yield a non-monotonic\nmobility at moderate fields. Consequently, in two-dimensional electrophoresis,\ngel bands display a characteristic arc pattern; this turns into a straight line\nwhen the density of dangling ends vanishes. We also provide a novel framework\nto accurately predict the shape of such arcs as a function of molecule length\nand topological complexity, which may be used to inform future experiments.\n", "  In this paper, we present a new experimental progress in brief on the recent\nobservation of the charged charmonium-like state Z_c(4020)^{+/-} states and its\niso-spin partner Z_c(4020)^{0} in pi pi hc process at the BESIII experiment.\nThe charged Z_{c}(4020) is its decay into \\pi^{+/-} hc final state, and carries\nelectric charge, thus it contains at least four quarks. The observation of both\ncharge and neutral state makes Z_{c}(4020) the first iso-spin triplet Z_{c}\nstate observed in experiment.\n", "  MCViNE (Monte-Carlo VIrtual Neutron Experiment) is a versatile Monte Carlo\n(MC) neutron ray-tracing program that provides researchers with tools for\nperforming computer modeling and simulations that mirror real neutron\nscattering experiments. By adopting modern software engineering practices such\nas using composite and visitor design patterns for representing and accessing\nneutron scatterers, and using recursive algorithms for multiple scattering,\nMCViNE is flexible enough to handle sophisticated neutron scattering problems\nincluding, for example, neutron detection by complex detector systems, and\nsingle and multiple scattering events in a variety of samples and sample\nenvironments. In addition, MCViNE can take advantage of simulation components\nin linear-chain-based MC ray tracing packages widely used in instrument design\nand optimization, as well as NumPy-based components that make prototypes useful\nand easy to develop. These developments have enabled us to carry out detailed\nsimulations of neutron scattering experiments with non-trivial samples in\ntime-of-flight inelastic instruments at the Spallation Neutron Source. Examples\nof such simulations for powder and single-crystal samples with various\nscattering kernels, including kernels for phonon and magnon scattering, are\npresented. With simulations that closely reproduce experimental results,\nscattering mechanisms can be turned on and off to determine how they contribute\nto the measured scattering intensities, improving our understanding of the\nunderlying physics.\n", "  By looking at the kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect (kSZ) in Planck nominal\nmission data, we present a significant detection of baryons participating in\nlarge-scale bulk flows around central galaxies (CGs) at redshift $z\\approx\n0.1$. We estimate the pairwise momentum of the kSZ temperature fluctuations at\nthe positions of the CGC (Central Galaxy Catalogue) samples extracted from\nSloan Digital Sky Survey (DR7) data. For the foreground-cleaned maps, we find\n$1.8$-$2.5\\sigma$ detections of the kSZ signal, which are consistent with the\nkSZ evidence found in individual Planck raw frequency maps, although lower than\nfound in the WMAP-9yr W band ($3.3\\sigma$). We further reconstruct the peculiar\nvelocity field from the CG density field, and compute for the first time the\ncross-correlation function between kSZ temperature fluctuations and estimates\nof CG radial peculiar velocities. This correlation function yields a\n$3.0$-$3.7$$\\sigma$ detection of the peculiar motion of extended gas on Mpc\nscales, in flows correlated up to distances of 80-100 $h^{-1}$ Mpc. Both the\npairwise momentum estimates and kSZ temperature-velocity field correlation find\nevidence for kSZ signatures out to apertures of 8 arcmin and beyond,\ncorresponding to a physical radius of $> 1$ Mpc, more than twice the mean\nvirial radius of halos. This is consistent with the predictions from hydro\nsimulations that most of the baryons are outside the virialized halos. We fit a\nsimple model, in which the temperature-velocity cross-correlation is\nproportional to the signal seen in a semi-analytic model built upon N-body\nsimulations, and interpret the proportionality constant as an \"effective\"\noptical depth to Thomson scattering. We find $\\tau_T=(1.4\\pm0.5)\\times\n10^{-4}$; the simplest interpretation of this measurement is that much of the\ngas is in a diffuse phase, which contributes little signal to X-ray or thermal\nSZ observations.\n", "  We performed electronic transport measurements on 1D InAs quantum wires. In\nsufficiently disordered wires, transport is dominated by Coulomb blockade, and\nthe conductance can be well described by tunneling through a quantum dot\nembedded between two one-dimensional Luttinger liquid wires. In contrast to\nprevious experiments in other material systems, in our system the conductance\ndifference between peak to valley decreases with decreasing temperature for\nseveral consecutive peaks. This phenomenon is theoretically expected to occur\nonly for strongly interacting systems with small Luttinger interaction\nparameter g < 1/2; we find for our InAs wires a value of g~0.4. Possible\nmechanisms leading to these strong correlations are discussed.\n", "  We investigate the muon anomalous magnetic moment in the context of the\nsupersymmetric version of the economical 3-3-1 model. We compute the 1-loop\ncontribution of super-partner particles. We show that contribution of\nsuperparticle loop becomes significant when \\tan \\gamma is large. We\ninvestigate for both small and large values of $\\tan \\gamma$. We find the\nregion of the parameter space where the slepton masses are of a few hundreds\nGeV is favour by the muon g-2 for small \\tan \\gamma (\\tan \\gamma \\sim 5 ).\nNumerical estimation gives the mass of supersymmetric particle, the mass of\ngauginos m_G \\sim 700 GeV and light slepton mass m_{\\tilde{L}} is of order O\n(100) GeV. When \\tan{\\gamma} is large (\\tan{\\gamma} \\sim 60), the mass of\ncharged slepton m_{\\tilde{L}} and the mass of gauginos m_G\\sim O(1) TeV while\nthe mass of sneutrino \\sim 450 GeV is in the reach of LHC.\n", "  Benford's Law states that the frequency of first digits of numbers in\nnaturally occurring systems is not evenly distributed. Numbers beginning with a\n1 occur roughly 30\\% of the time, and are six times more common than numbers\nbeginning with a 9. We show that Benford's Law applies to social and behavioral\nfeatures of users in online social networks. We consider social data from five\nmajor social networks: Facebook, Twitter, Google Plus, Pinterest, and Live\nJournal. We show that the distribution of first significant digits of friend\nand follower counts for users in these systems follow Benford's Law. The same\nholds for the number of posts users make. We extend this to egocentric\nnetworks, showing that friend counts among the people in an individual's social\nnetwork also follow the expected distribution. We discuss how this can be used\nto detect suspicious or fraudulent activity online and to validate datasets.\n", "  It is pointed out that the mystery of how biological systems measure their\nlengths vanishes away if one premises that they have discovered a way to\ngenerate linear waves analogous to compressional sound. These can be used to\ndetect length at either large or small scales using echo timing and fringe\ncounting. It is shown that suitable linear chemical potential waves can, in\nfact, be manufactured by tuning to criticality conventional reaction-diffusion\nwith a small number substances. Min oscillations in E. coli are cited as\nprecedent resonant length measurement using chemical potential waves analogous\nto laser detection. Mitotic structures in eucaryotes are identified as\ncandidates for such an effect at higher frequency. The engineering principle is\nshown to be very general and functionally the same as that used by hearing\norgans.\n  PNAS Significance Statement: This paper invokes physical principles to\naddress the question of how living things might use reaction-diffusion to\nmeasure out and regulate the many thousands of lengths required to make their\nbody parts and internal organs. It argues that two ideas have been missing. One\nis that oscillation is necessary to achieve the necessary design stability and\nplasticity. The other is that the system must be tuned to criticality to\nstabilize the propagation velocity, thus enabling clocks to function as meter\nsticks. The broader significance is twofold: First, a fundamental piece of the\nmachinery of life is probably invisible to present-day biochemical methods\nbecause they are too slow. Second, the simplicity of growth and form identified\na century ago by D'Arcy Thompson is probably a symptom of biological\nengineering strategies, not primitive law.\n", "  I present calculations of reflection beamshifts, Goos-H\\\"anchen and\nImbert-Fedorov shifts, due to the presence of a monolayer graphene on a\ndielectric media when using a beam with wavelength in the visible range.\nMeasuring the Goos-H\\\"anchen and Imbert-Fedorov shifts is an alternative method\nto determine graphene's conductivity. I look at beamshifts for different\npolarization states ($p$, $s$, $45^0$, $\\sigma^+$) and I discuss other possible\nexperimental routes to determine these beamshifts and consequently, the\ngraphene's optical conductivity. The Goos-H\\\"anchen shifts for visible light I\ncalculated are in good agreement with results of a recent experiment.\n", "  Experimental form factors of the hydrogen and helium isotopes, extracted from\nan up-to-date global analysis of cross sections and polarization observables\nmeasured in elastic electron scattering from these systems, are compared to\npredictions obtained in three different theoretical approaches: the first is\nbased on realistic interactions and currents, including relativistic\ncorrections (labeled as the conventional approach); the second relies on a\nchiral effective field theory description of the strong and electromagnetic\ninteractions in nuclei (labeled $\\chi$EFT); the third utilizes a fully\nrelativistic treatment of nuclear dynamics as implemented in the covariant\nspectator theory (labeled CST). For momentum transfers below $Q \\lesssim 5$\nfm$^{-1}$ there is satisfactory agreement between experimental data and\ntheoretical results in all three approaches. However, at $Q \\gtrsim 5$\nfm$^{-1}$, particularly in the case of the deuteron, a relativistic treatment\nof the dynamics, as is done in the CST, is necessary. The experimental data on\nthe deuteron $A$ structure function extend to $Q \\simeq 12$ fm$^{-1}$, and the\nclose agreement between these data and the CST results suggests that, even in\nthis extreme kinematical regime, there is no evidence for new effects coming\nfrom quark and gluon degrees of freedom at short distances.\n", "  A growing or compressed thin elastic sheet adhered to a rigid substrate can\nexhibit a buckling instability, forming an inward hump. Our study shows that\nthe strip morphology depends on the delicate balance between the compression\nenergy and the bending energy. We find that this instability is a first order\nphase transition between the adhered solution and the buckled solution whose\nmain control parameter is related to the sheet stretchability. In the nearly-\nunstretchable regime we provide an analytic expression for the critical\nthreshold. Compressibility is the key assumption which allows us to resolve the\napparent paradox of an unbounded pressure exerted on the external wall by a\nconfined flexible loop.\n", "  Social media enabled a direct path from producer to consumer of contents\nchanging the way users get informed, debate, and shape their worldviews. Such a\n{\\em disintermediation} weakened consensus on social relevant issues in favor\nof rumors, mistrust, and fomented conspiracy thinking -- e.g., chem-trails\ninducing global warming, the link between vaccines and autism, or the New World\nOrder conspiracy.\n  In this work, we study through a thorough quantitative analysis how different\nconspiracy topics are consumed in the Italian Facebook. By means of a\nsemi-automatic topic extraction strategy, we show that the most discussed\ncontents semantically refer to four specific categories: {\\em environment},\n{\\em diet}, {\\em health}, and {\\em geopolitics}. We find similar patterns by\ncomparing users activity (likes and comments) on posts belonging to different\nsemantic categories. However, if we focus on the lifetime -- i.e., the distance\nin time between the first and the last comment for each user -- we notice a\nremarkable difference within narratives -- e.g., users polarized on geopolitics\nare more persistent in commenting, whereas the less persistent are those\nfocused on diet related topics. Finally, we model users mobility across various\ntopics finding that the more a user is active, the more he is likely to join\nall topics. Once inside a conspiracy narrative users tend to embrace the\noverall corpus.\n", "  A finite-temperature effective free energy of the boundary of a quantized\nthermal Hall system is derived microscopically from the bulk two-dimensional\nDirac fermion coupled with a gravitational field. In two spatial dimensions,\nthe thermal Hall conductivity of fully gapped insulators and superconductors is\nquantized and given by the bulk Chern number, in analogy to the quantized\nelectric Hall conductivity in quantum Hall systems. From the perspective of\neffective action functionals, two distinct types of the field theory have been\nproposed to describe the quantized thermal Hall effect. One of these, known as\nthe gravitational Chern-Simons action, is a kind of topological field theory,\nand the other is a phenomenological theory relevant to the St\\v{r}eda formula.\nIn order to solve this problem, we derive microscopically an effective theory\nthat accounts for the quantized thermal Hall effect. In this paper, the\ntwo-dimensional Dirac fermion under a static background gravitational field is\nconsidered in equilibrium at a finite temperature, from which an effective\nboundary free energy functional of the gravitational field is derived. This\nboundary theory is shown to explain the quantized thermal Hall conductivity and\nthermal Hall current in the bulk by assuming the Lorentz symmetry. The bulk\neffective theory is consistently determined via the boundary effective theory\n", "  The vector Riemann-Hilbert problem is analyzed when the entries of its matrix\ncoefficient are meromorphic and almost periodic functions. Three cases for the\nmeromorphic functions, when they have (i) a finite number of poles and zeros\n(rational functions), (ii) periodic poles and zeros, and (iii) an infinite\nnumber of non periodic zeros and poles, are considered. The first case is\nillustrated by the heat equation for a composite rod with a finite number of\ndiscontinuities and a system of convolution equations; both problems are solved\nexplicitly. In the second case, a Wiener-Hopf factorization is found in terms\nof the hypergeometric functions, and the exact solution of a mixed boundary\nvalue problem for the Laplace equation in wedge is derived. In the last case,\nthe Riemann-Hilbert problem reduces to an infinite system of linear algebraic\nequations with the exponential rate of convergence. As an example, the Neumann\nboundary value problem for the Helmholtz equation in a strip with a slit is\nanalyzed.\n", "  Marine bacterium Vibrio alginolyticus uses a single polar flagellum to\nnavigate in an aqueous environment. Similar to Escherichia coli cells, the\npolar flagellar motor has two states; when the motor is counter-clockwise, the\ncell swims forward and when the motor is clockwise, the cell swims backward. V.\nalginolyticus also incorporates a direction randomization step at the start of\nthe forward swimming interval by flicking its flagellum. To gain an\nunderstanding on how the polar flagellar motor switch is regulated,\ndistributions of the forward $\\Delta_{f}$ and backward $\\Delta_{b}$ intervals\nare investigated herein. We found that the steady-state probability density\nfunctions, $P(\\Delta_{f})$ and $P(\\Delta_{b})$, of freely swimming bacteria are\nstrongly peaked at a finite time, suggesting that the motor switch is not\nPoissonian. The short-time inhibition is sufficiently strong and long lasting,\ni.e., several hundred milliseconds for both intervals, which is readily\nobserved and characterized. Treating motor reversal dynamics as a first-passage\nproblem, which results from conformation fluctuations of the motor switch, we\ncalculated $P(\\Delta_{f})$ and $P(\\Delta_{b})$ and found good agreement with\nthe measurements.\n", "  We study smooth SU(2) solutions of the Hitchin equations on R^2, with the\ndeterminant of the complex Higgs field being a polynomial of degree n. When\nn>=3, there are moduli spaces of solutions, in the sense that the natural L^2\nmetric is well-defined on a subset of the parameter space. We examine\nrotationally-symmetric solutions for n=1 and n=2, and then focus on the n=3\ncase, elucidating the moduli and describing the asymptotic geometry as well as\nthe geometry of two totally-geodesic surfaces.\n", "  The propagation of a probe laser field in a cavity optomechanical system with\na Bose-Einstein condensate is studied. The transmission properties of the\nsystem are investigated and it is shown that the group velocity of the probe\npulse field can be controlled by Rabi frequency of the pump laser field. The\neffect of the decay rate of the cavity photons on the group velocity is studied\nand it is demonstrated that for small values of the decay rates, the slope of\nphase dispersion switches from positive to negative just by changing the Rabi\nfrequency of the pump field. Then, the gain-assisted superluminal light\npropagation due to the cross-Kerr nonlinearity is established in cavity\noptomechanical system with a Bose-Einstein condensate. Such behavior can not\nappear in the pump-probe two-level atomic systems in the normal phase. We also\nfind that the amplification is achieved without inversion in the population of\nthe quantum energy levels.\n", "  Attention has focussed recently on models of inflation that involve a second\nor more fields with a mass near the inflationary Hubble parameter $H$, as may\noccur in supersymmetric theories if the supersymmetry-breaking scale is not far\nfrom $H$. Quasi-single-field (QsF) inflation is a relatively simple family of\nphenomenological models that serve as a proxy for theories with additional\nfields with masses $m\\sim H$. Since QsF inflation involves fields in addition\nto the inflaton, the consistency conditions (ccs) between correlations that\narise in single-clock inflation are not necessarily satisfied. As a result,\ncorrelation functions in the squeezed limit may be larger than in single-field\ninflation. Scalar non-Gaussianities mediated by the massive isocurvature field\nin QsF have been shown to be potentially observable. These are especially\ninteresting since they would convey information about the mass of the\nisocurvature field. Here we consider non-Gaussian correlators involving tensor\nmodes and their observational signatures. A physical correlation between a\n(long-wavelength) tensor mode and two scalar modes (tss), for instance, may\ngive rise to local departures from statistical isotropy or, in other words, a\nnon-trivial four-point function. The presence of the tensor mode may moreover\nbe inferred geometrically from the shape dependence of the four-point function.\nWe compute tss and stt (one soft curvature mode and two hard tensors) bispectra\nin QsF inflation, identifying the conditions necessary for these to \"violate\"\nthe ccs. We find that while ccs are violated by stt correlations, they are\npreserved by the tss in the minimal QsF model. Our study of primordial\ncorrelators which include gravitons in seeking imprints of additional fields\nwith masses $m\\sim H$ during inflation can be seen as complementary to the\nrecent \"cosmological collider physics\" proposal.\n", "  A target composition scheme to optimize the combined proton acceleration\nregime is presented and verified by two-dimensional particle-in-cell (2D PIC)\nsimulations by using an ultra-intense circularly-polarized (CP) laser pulse\nirradiating an overdense hydrocarbon (CH) target, instead of a pure hydrogen\n(H) one. The combined acceleration regime is a two-stage proton acceleration\nscheme combining the radiation pressure dominated acceleration (RPDA) stage and\nthe laser wakefield acceleration (LWFA) stage sequentially together. With an\nultra-intense CP laser pulse irradiating an overdense CH target, followed by an\nunderdense tritium plasma gas, protons with higher energies (from about $20$\nGeV up to about $30$ GeV) and lower energy spreads (from about $18\\%$ down to\nabout $5\\%$ in full-width at half-maximum, or FWHM) are generated, as compared\nto the use of a pure H target. It is because protons can be more stably\npre-accelerated in the first RPDA stage when using CH targets. With the\nincrease of the carbon-to-hydrogen density ratio, the energy spread is lower\nand the maximum proton energy is higher. It also shows that for the same laser\nintensity around $10^{22}$ $Wcm^{-2}$, using the CH target will lead to a\nhigher proton energy, as compared to the use of a pure H target. Additionally,\nproton energy can be further increased by employing a longitudinally negative\ngradient of a background plasma density.\n", "  The organization of the axonal cytoskeleton is a key determinant of the\nnormal function of an axon, which is a long thin projection away from a neuron.\nUnder normal conditions two axonal cytoskeletal polymers microtubules and\nneurofilaments align longitudinally in axons and are interspersed in axonal\ncross-sections. However, in many neurotoxic and neurodegenerative disorders,\nmicrotubules and neurofilaments segregate apart from each other, with\nmicrotubules and membranous organelles clustered centrally and neurofilaments\ndisplaced to the periphery. This striking segregation precedes abnormal and\nexcessive neurofilament accumulation in these diseases, which in turn leads to\nfocal axonal swellings. While neurofilament accumulation suggests the\nimpairment of neurofilament transport along axons, the underlying mechanism of\ntheir segregation from microtubules remains poorly understood for over 30\nyears. To address this question, we developed a stochastic multiscale model for\nthe cross-sectional distribution of microtubules and neurofilaments in axons.\nThe model describes microtubules, neurofilaments and organelles as interacting\nparticles in a 2D cross-section, and incorporates the stochastic interactions\nthese particles through molecular motors. Simulations of the model demonstrate\nthat organelles can pull nearby microtubules together, and in the absence of\nneurofilament transport, this mechanism gradually segregates microtubules from\nneurofilaments on a time scale of hours, similar to that observed in toxic\nneuropathies. This suggests that the microtubule-neurofilament segregation is\nsimply a consequence of the selective impairment of neurofilament transport.\nThe model generates the experimentally testable prediction that the rate and\nextent of segregation will be dependent on the sizes of the moving organelles\nas well as the density of their traffic.\n", "  We embed general $f(R)$ inflationary models in minimal supergravity plus\nmatter, a single chiral superfield $\\Phi$, with or without another superfield\n$S$, via a Jordan frame Einstein+scalar description. In particular,\ninflationary models like a generalized Starobinsky one are analyzed and\nconstraints on them are found. We also embed the related models of conformal\ninflation, also described as Jordan frame Einstein+scalar models, in particular\nthe conformal inflation from the Higgs model, and analyze the inflationary\nconstraints on them.\n", "  Vacancies in graphene lead to the appearance of localized electronic states\nwith non-vanishing spin moments. Using a mean-field Hubbard model and an\neffective double-quantum dot description we investigate the influence of strain\non localization and magnetic properties of the vacancy-induced states in\nsemiconducting armchair nanoribbons. We find that the exchange splitting of a\nsingle vacancy and the singlet-triplet splitting for two vacancies can be\nwidely tuned by applying uniaxial strain, which is crucial for spintronic\napplications.\n", "  The phase diagram of cold dense quark matter is studied using the 't Hooft\nextended Nambu--Jona-Lasinio Model applied to the light quark sector with a\nfinite current mass for the strange quark (up and down are considered in the\nchiral limit). By relaxing the traditional uniformity assumptions and\nconsidering a modulated light quark condensate background we investigate the\npossible existence of non-uniform phases in this region of the phase diagram.\nThe effects of changes in the coupling strengths of the model are studied and\nit is shown that the inclusion of flavour mixing combined with the finite\ncurrent mass of the strange quark catalyses the appearance of the non-uniform\nphases, extending the domain for their existence.\n", "  We present results of numerical simulations on a one-dimensional Ising spin\nglass with long-range interactions. Parameters of the model are chosen such\nthat it is a proxy for a short-range spin glass above the upper critical\ndimension (i.e. in the mean-field regime). The system is quenched to a\ntemperature well below the transition temperature $T_c$ and the growth of\ncorrelations is observed. The spatial decay of the correlations at distances\nless than the dynamic correlation length $\\xi(t)$ agrees quantitatively with\nthe predictions of a static theory, the \"metastate\", evaluated according to the\nreplica symmetry breaking (RSB) theory. We also compute the dynamic exponent\n$z(T)$ defined by $\\xi(t) \\propto t^{1/z(T)}$ and find that it is compatible\nwith the mean-field value of the critical dynamical exponent for short range\nspin glasses.\n", "  We explore unification and natural supersymmetry in a five dimensional\nextension of the standard model in which the extra dimension may be large, of\nthe order of 1-10 TeV. Power law running generates a TeV scale A_ term allowing\nfor the observed 125 GeV Higgs and allowing for stop masses below 2 TeV,\ncompatible with a natural SUSY spectrum. We supply the full one-loop RGEs for\nvarious models and use metastability to give a prediction that the gluino mass\nshould be lighter than 3.5 TeV for A_t <= 2.5 TeV, for such a compactification\nscale, with brane localised 3rd generation matter. We discuss why models in\nwhich the 1st and 2nd generation of matter fields are located in the bulk are\nlikely to be ruled out. We also look at electroweak symmetry breaking in these\nmodels.\n", "  In this paper an analytical and numerical study of anharmonic vibrations of\nmonatomic chain and graphene in transverse (perpendicular) with respect to the\nchain/plane direction is presented. Due to the lack of odd anharmonicities and\npresence of hard quartic anharmonicity for displacements in this direction,\nthere may exist localized anharmonic transverse modes with the frequencies\nabove the spectrum of the corresponding phonons. Although these frequencies are\nin resonance with longitudinal (chain) or in-plane (graphene) phonons, the\nmodes can decay only due to a weak anharmonic process. Therefore the lifetime\nof these vibrations may be very long. E.g. in the chain, according to our\ntheoretical and numerical calculations it may exceed 10^10 periods. We call\nthese vibrations as transverse intrinsic localized modes.\n", "  An original boundary integral formulation is proposed for the problem of a\nsemi-infinite crack at the interface between two dissimilar elastic materials\nin the presence of heat flows and mass diffusion. Symmetric and skew-symmetric\nweight function matrices are used together with a generalized Betti's\nreciprocity theorem in order to derive a system of integral equations that\nrelate the applied loading, the temperature and mass concentration fields, the\nheat and mass fluxes on the fracture surfaces and the resulting crack opening.\nThe obtained integral identities can have many relevant applications, such as\nfor the modelling of crack and damage processes at the interface between\ndifferent components in electrochemical energy devices characterized by\nmulti-layered structures (solid oxide fuel cells and lithium ions batteries).\n", "  We study the thermoelectric transport in two dimensional topological system\nwhich has coexistence of superconductivity(SC) and spin-density wave(SDW). The\nSC is presumed to be of $d_{x^2-y^2}+(p_x + i p_y) $ type whereas the SDW order\nparameter is of $BCS$ symmetry. The Hamiltonian describing such a coexistence\nphase is shown to have topological phase in addition to the conventional one.\nThe transport properties in such topological system have two distinct\ncontributions: (i) the surface/edge and (ii) the bulk. The competition between\nthe surface/edge versus the bulk transport is analyzed in different parameter\nregimes and the possibility of enhancing the figure of merit is discussed.\n", "  Excited electrons in the conduction band of germanium collect into four\nenergy minima, or valleys, in momentum space. These local minima have highly\nanisotropic mass tensors which cause the electrons to travel in directions\nwhich are oblique to an applied electric field at sub-Kelvin temperatures and\nlow electric fields, in contrast to the more isotropic behavior of the holes.\nThis experiment produces, for the first time, a full two-dimensional image of\nthe oblique electron and hole propagation and the quantum transitions of\nelectrons between valleys for electric fields oriented along the [0,0,1]\ndirection. Charge carriers are excited with a focused laser pulse on one face\nof a germanium crystal and then drifted through the crystal by a uniform\nelectric field of strength between 0.5 and 6 V/cm. The pattern of charge\ndensity arriving on the opposite face is used to reconstruct the trajectories\nof the carriers. Measurements of the two-dimensional pattern of charge density\nare compared in detail with Monte Carlo simulations developed for the Cryogenic\nDark Matter Search (CDMS) to model the transport of charge carriers in\nhigh-purity germanium detectors.\n", "  Here we present an all-optical plasmon coupling scheme, utilising the\nintrinsic nonlinear optical response of graphene. We demonstrate coupling of\nfree-space, visible light pulses to the surface plasmons in a planar,\nun-patterned graphene sheet by using nonlinear wave mixing to match both the\nwavevector and energy of the surface wave. By carefully controlling the\nphase-matching conditions, we show that one can excite surface plasmons with a\ndefined wavevector and direction across a large frequency range, with an\nestimated photon efficiency in our experiments approaching $10^{-5}$.\n", "  AMS-02 provided the unprecedented statistics in the measurement of the\npositron fraction from cosmic rays. That may offer a unique opportunity to\ndistinguish the positron spectrum coming from various dark matter (DM)\nannihilation channels, if DM is the source of this positron excess. Therefore,\nwe consider the scenario that the DM can annihilate into leptonic, quark, and\nmassive gauge boson channels simultaneously with floating branching ratios to\ntest this hypothesis. We also study the impacts from MAX, MED, MIN, and DC\ndiffusion models as well as from isothermal, NFW, and Einasto DM density\nprofiles on our results. We found two parameter regions that can satisfy both\nAMS-02 $\\frac{e^+}{e^++e^-}$ and $\\bar{p}/p$ datasets at 95\\% CL. i) Under the\nNFW-MIN combination with $M_{\\chi}\\subset[10,30]$ TeV. ii) Under the Einasto-DC\ncombination with $M_{\\chi}\\subset[500,1500]$ GeV.\n", "  In Higgs-otic inflation a complex neutral scalar combination of the $h^0$ and\n$H^0$ MSSM Higgs fields plays the role of inflaton in a chaotic fashion. The\npotential is protected from large trans-Planckian corrections at large inflaton\nif the system is embedded in string theory so that the Higgs fields parametrize\na D-brane position. The inflaton potential is then given by a DBI+CS D-brane\naction yielding an approximate linear behaviour at large field. The inflaton\nscalar potential is a 2-field model with specific non-canonical kinetic terms.\nPrevious computations of the cosmological parameters (i.e. scalar and tensor\nperturbations) did not take into account the full 2-field character of the\nmodel, ignoring in particular the presence of isocurvature perturbations and\ntheir coupling to the adiabatic modes. It is well known that for generic\n2-field potentials such effects may significantly alter the observational\nsignatures of a given model. We perform a full analysis of adiabatic and\nisocurvature perturbations in the Higgs-otic 2-field model. We show that the\npredictivity of the model is increased compared to the adiabatic approximation.\nIsocurvature perturbations moderately feed back into adiabatic fluctuations.\nHowever, the isocurvature component is exponentially damped by the end of\ninflation. The tensor to scalar ratio varies in a region $r=0.08-0.12$,\nconsistent with combined Planck/BICEP results.\n", "  We propose a way to control the Josephson energy of a single Josephson\njunction embedded in one- dimensional superconducting metamaterial: an\ninhomogeneous superconducting loop, made out of a superconducting nanowire or a\nchain of Josephson junctions. The Josephson energy is renormalized by the\nelectromagnetic modes propagating along the loop. We study the behaviour of the\nmodes as well as of their frequency spectrum when the capacitance and the\ninductance along the loop are spatially modulated. We show that, depending on\nthe amplitude of the modulation, the renormalized Josephson energy is either\nlarger or smaller than the one found for a homogeneous loop. Using typical\nexperimental parameters for Josepshon junction chains and superconducting\nnanowires, we conclude that this mode-engineering can be achieved with\ncurrently available metamaterials.\n", "  In this paper, for a Lie 2-algebra $\\g$, we construct the automorphism\n2-group $\\Aut(\\g)$, which turns out to be an integration of the derivation Lie\n2-algebra $\\Der(\\g)$.\n", "  Applying the machinery of random matrix theory and Toeplitz determinants we\nstudy the level $k$, $U(N)$ Chern-Simons theory coupled with fundamental matter\non $S^2\\times S^1$ at finite temperature $T$. This theory admits a discrete\nmatrix integral representation, i.e. a unitary discrete matrix model of\ntwo-dimensional Yang-Mills theory. In this study, the effective partition\nfunction and phase structure of the Chern-Simons matter theory, in a special\ncase with an effective potential namely the Gross-Witten-Wadia potential, are\ninvestigated. We obtain an exact expression for the partition function of the\nChern-Simons matter theory as a function of $k,N,T,$ for finite values and in\nthe asymptotic regime. In the Gross-Witten-Wadia case, we show that ratio of\nthe Chern-Simons matter partition function and the continuous two-dimensional\nYang-Mills partition function, in the asymptotic regime, is the Tracy-Widom\ndistribution. Consequently, using the explicit results for free energy of the\ntheory, new second-order and third-order phase transitions are observed.\nDepending on the phase, in the asymptotic regime, Chern-Simons matter theory is\nrepresented either by a continuous or discrete two-dimensional Yang-Mills\ntheory, separated by a third-order domain wall.\n", "  Any national cuisine is a sum total of its variety of regional cuisines,\nwhich are the cultural and historical identifiers of their respective regions.\nIndia is home to a number of regional cuisines that showcase its culinary\ndiversity. Here, we study recipes from eight different regional cuisines of\nIndia spanning various geographies and climates. We investigate the phenomenon\nof food pairing which examines compatibility of two ingredients in a recipe in\nterms of their shared flavor compounds. Food pairing was enumerated at the\nlevel of cuisine, recipes as well as ingredient pairs by quantifying flavor\nsharing between pairs of ingredients. Our results indicate that each regional\ncuisine follows negative food pairing pattern; more the extent of flavor\nsharing between two ingredients, lesser their co-occurrence in that cuisine. We\nfind that frequency of ingredient usage is central in rendering the\ncharacteristic food pairing in each of these cuisines. Spice and dairy emerged\nas the most significant ingredient classes responsible for the biased pattern\nof food pairing. Interestingly while individual spices contribute to negative\nfood pairing, dairy products on the other hand tend to deviate food pairing\ntowards positive side. Our data analytical study highlighting statistical\nproperties of the regional cuisines, brings out their culinary fingerprints\nthat could be used to design algorithms for generating novel recipes and recipe\nrecommender systems. It forms a basis for exploring possible causal connection\nbetween diet and health as well as prospection of therapeutic molecules from\nfood ingredients. Our study also provides insights as to how big data can\nchange the way we look at food.\n", "  We introduce potential capacities of quantum channels in an operational way\nand provide upper bounds for these quantities, which quantify the ultimate\nlimit of usefulness of a channel for a given task in the best possible context.\nUnfortunately, except for a few isolated cases, potential capacities seem to be\nas hard to compute as their \"plain\" analogues. We thus study upper bounds on\nsome potential capacities: For the classical capacity, we give an upper bound\nin terms of the entanglement of formation. To establish a bound for the quantum\nand private capacity, we first \"lift\" the channel to a Hadamard channel and\nthen prove that the quantum and private capacity of a Hadamard channel is\nstrongly additive, implying that for these channels, potential and plain\ncapacity are equal. Employing these upper bounds we show that if a channel is\nnoisy, however close it is to the noiseless channel, then it cannot be\nactivated into the noiseless channel by any other contextual channel; this\nconclusion holds for all the three capacities. We also discuss the so-called\nenvironment-assisted quantum capacity, because we are able to characterize its\n\"potential\" version.\n", "  We extend the study of corrections to the eikonal approximation that was\ninitiated in Ref. \\cite{Altinoluk:2014oxa} to higher orders. These corrections\nassociated with the finite width of the target are investigated and the gluon\npropagator in background field is calculated at next-to-next-to-eikonal\naccuracy. The result is then applied to the single inclusive gluon production\ncross section at central rapidities and the light-front helicity asymmetry, in\npA collisions, in order to analyse these observables beyond the eikonal limit.\nThe next-to-next-to-eikonal corrections to the unpolarized cross section are\nnon-zero and provide the first corrections to the usual $k_\\perp$-factorized\nexpression. In contrast, the eikonal and next-to-next-to-eikonal contributions\nto the helicity asymmetry vanish, while the next-to-eikonal ones are non-zero.\n", "  We analyze spin-dependent carrier dynamics due to incoherent electron-phonon\nscattering, which is commonly referred to as Elliott-Yafet (EY) spin-relaxation\nmechanism. For this mechanism one usually distinguishes two contributions: (1)\nfrom the electrostatic interaction together with spin-mixing in the wave\nfunctions, which is often called the Elliott contribution, and (2) the\nphonon-modulated spin-orbit interaction, which is often called the Yafet or\nOverhauser contribution. By computing the reduced electronic density matrix, we\nimprove Yafet's original calculation, which is not valid for pronounced spin\nmixing as it equates the pseudo-spin polarization with the spin polarization.\nThe important novel quantity in our calculation is a torque operator that\ndetermines the spin dynamics. The contribution (1) to this torque vanishes\nexactly. From this general result, we derive a modified expression for the\nElliott-Yafet spin relaxation time.\n", "  We study the mean-field phase diagram of the two-dimensional (2D) Hubbard\nmodel in the Lieb lattice allowing for spin and charge density waves. Previous\nstudies of this diagram have shown that the mean-field magnetization\nsurprisingly deviates from the value predicted by Lieb's theorem\n\\cite{Lieb1989} as the on-site repulsive Coulomb interaction ($U$) becomes\nsmaller \\cite{Gouveia2015}. Here, we show that in order for Lieb's theorem to\nbe satisfied, a more complex mean-field approach should be followed in the case\nof bipartite lattices or other lattices whose unit cells contain more than two\ntypes of atoms. In the case of the Lieb lattice, we show that, by allowing the\nsystem to modulate the magnetization and charge density between sublattices,\nthe difference in the absolute values of the magnetization of the sublattices,\n$m_{\\text{Lieb}}$, at half-filling, saturates at the exact value $1/2$ for any\nvalue of $U$, as predicted by Lieb. Additionally, Lieb's relation,\n$m_{\\text{Lieb}}=1/2$, is verified approximately for large $U$, in the $n \\in\n[2/3,4/3]$ range. This range includes not only the ferromagnetic region of the\nphase diagram of the Lieb lattice (see Ref.~\\onlinecite{Gouveia2015}), but also\nthe adjacent spiral regions. In fact, in this lattice, below or at\nhalf-filling, $m_{\\text{Lieb}}$ is simply the filling of the quasi-flat bands\nin the mean-field energy dispersion both for large and small $U$.\n", "  In the Bona-Masso formulation, Einstein equations are written as a set of\nflux conservative first order hyperbolic equations that resemble fluid dynamics\nequations. Based on this formulation, we construct a lattice Boltzmann model\nfor Numerical Relativity. Our model is validated with well-established tests,\nshowing good agreement with analytical solutions. Furthermore, we show that by\nincreasing the relaxation time, we gain stability at the cost of losing\naccuracy, and by decreasing the lattice spacings while keeping a constant\nnumerical diffusivity, the accuracy and stability of our simulations improves.\nFinally, in order to show the potential of our approach a linear scaling law\nfor parallelisation with respect to number of CPU cores is demonstrated. Our\nmodel represents the first step in using lattice kinetic theory to solve\ngravitational problems.\n", "  The growth of snow crystals is dependent on the temperature and saturation of\nthe environment. In the case of dendrites, Reiter's local two-dimensional model\nprovides a realistic approach to the study of dendrite growth. In this paper we\nobtain a new geometric rule that incorporates interface control, a basic\nmechanism of crystallization that is not taken into account in the original\nReiter's model. By defining two new variables, growth latency and growth\ndirection, our improved model gives a realistic model not only for dendrite but\nalso for plate forms.\n", "  Nuclear spin registers in the vicinity of electron spins in solid state\nsystems offer a powerful resource to address the challenge of scalability in\nquantum architectures. We investigate here the properties of $^{29}$Si nuclear\nspins surrounding donor atoms in silicon, and consider the use of such spins,\ncombined with the donor nuclear spin, as a quantum register coupled to the\ndonor electron spin. We find the coherence of the nearby $^{29}$Si nuclear\nspins is effectively protected by the presence of the donor electron spin,\nleading to coherence times in the second timescale - over two orders of\nmagnitude greater than the coherence times in bulk silicon. We theoretically\ninvestigate the use of such a register for quantum error correction, including\nmethods to protect nuclear spins from the ionisation/neutralisation of the\ndonor, which is necessary for the re-initialisation of the ancillae qubits.\nThis provides a route for multi-round quantum error correction using donors in\nsilicon.\n", "  This paper presents numerical results for the two-dimensional isotropic\nKuramoto-Sivashinsky equation (KSE) with an additional nonlinear term and a\nsingle independent parameter. Surfaces generated by this equation exhibit a\ncertain dependence of the average saturated roughness on the system size that\nindicates power-law shape of the surface spectrum for small wave numbers. This\nleads to a conclusion that although cellular surface patterns of definite scale\ndominate in the range of short distances, there are also scale-free long-range\nheight variations present in the large systems. The dependence of the spectral\nexponent on the equation parameter gives some insight into the scaling behavior\nfor large systems.\n", "  The extent of nucleosynthesis in models of type I X-ray bursts and the\nassociated impact on the energy released in these explosive events are\nsensitive to nuclear masses and reaction rates around the $^{64}$Ge waiting\npoint. Using the well known mass of $^{64}$Ge, the recently measured $^{65}$As\nmass, and large-scale shell model calculations, we have determined new\nthermonuclear rates of the $^{64}$Ge($p$,$\\gamma$)$^{65}$As and\n$^{65}$As($p$,$\\gamma$)$^{66}$Se reactions with reliable uncertainties. The new\nreaction rates differ significantly from previously published rates. Using the\nnew data we analyze the impact of the new rates and the remaining nuclear\nphysics uncertainties on the $^{64}$Ge waiting point in a number of\nrepresentative one-zone X-ray burst models. We find that in contrast to\nprevious work, when all relevant uncertainties are considered, a strong\n$^{64}$Ge $rp$-process waiting point cannot be ruled out. The nuclear physics\nuncertainties strongly affect X-ray burst model predictions of the synthesis of\n$^{64}$Zn, the synthesis of nuclei beyond $A=64$, energy generation, and burst\nlight curve. We also identify key nuclear uncertainties that need to be\naddressed to determine the role of the $^{64}$Ge waiting point in X-ray bursts.\nThese include the remaining uncertainty in the $^{65}$As mass, the uncertainty\nof the $^{66}$Se mass, and the remaining uncertainty in the\n$^{65}$As($p$,$\\gamma$)$^{66}$Se reaction rate, which mainly originates from\nuncertain resonance energies.\n", "  A central goal of synthetic biology is to design sophisticated synthetic\ncellular circuits that can perform complex computations and information\nprocessing tasks in response to specific inputs. The tremendous advances in our\nability to understand and manipulate cellular information processing networks\nraises several fundamental physics questions: How do the molecular components\nof cellular circuits exploit energy consumption to improve information\nprocessing? Can one utilize ideas from thermodynamics to improve the design of\nsynthetic cellular circuits and modules? Here, we summarize recent theoretical\nwork addressing these questions. Energy consumption in cellular circuits serves\nfive basic purposes: (1) increasing specificity, (2) manipulating dynamics, (3)\nreducing variability, (4) amplifying signal, and (5) erasing memory. We\ndemonstrate these ideas using several simple examples and discuss the\nimplications of these theoretical ideas for the emerging field of synthetic\nbiology. We conclude by discussing how it may be possible to overcome these\nlimitations using \"post-translational\" synthetic biology that exploits\nreversible protein modification.\n", "  We introduce an event-by-event perturbative-QCD + saturation + hydro (\"EKRT\")\nframework for ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions, where we compute the\nproduced fluctuating QCD-matter energy densities from next-to-leading order\nperturbative QCD using a saturation conjecture to control soft particle\nproduction, and describe the space-time evolution of the QCD matter with\ndissipative fluid dynamics, event by event. We perform a simultaneous\ncomparison of the centrality dependence of hadronic multiplicities, transverse\nmomentum spectra, and flow coefficients of the azimuth-angle asymmetries,\nagainst the LHC and RHIC measurements. We compare also the computed\nevent-by-event probability distributions of relative fluctuations of elliptic\nflow, and event-plane angle correlations, with the experimental data from Pb+Pb\ncollisions at the LHC. We show how such a systematic multi-energy and\nmulti-observable analysis tests the initial state calculation and the\napplicability region of hydrodynamics, and in particular how it constrains the\ntemperature dependence of the shear viscosity-to-entropy ratio of QCD matter in\nits different phases in a remarkably consistent manner.\n", "  The morphology of urban agglomeration is studied here in the context of\ninformation exchange between different spatio-temporal scales. Cities are\nmultidimensional non-linear phenomena, so understanding the relationships and\nconnectivity between scales is important in determining how the interplay of\nlocal/regional urban policies may affect the distribution of urban settlements.\nIn order to quantify these relationships, we follow an information theoretic\napproach using the concept of Transfer Entropy. Our analysis is based on a\nstochastic urban fractal model, which mimics urban growing settlements and\nmigration waves. The results indicate how different policies could affect urban\nmorphology in terms of the information generated across geographical scales.\n", "  Belief propagation (BP) is a message-passing method for solving probabilistic\ngraphical models. It is very successful in treating disordered models (such as\nspin glasses) on random graphs. On the other hand, finite-dimensional lattice\nmodels have an abundant number of short loops, and the BP method is still far\nfrom being satisfactory in treating the complicated loop-induced correlations\nin these systems. Here we propose a loop-corrected BP method to take into\naccount the effect of short loops in lattice spin models. We demonstrate,\nthrough an application to the square-lattice Ising model, that loop-corrected\nBP improves over the naive BP method significantly. We also implement\nloop-corrected BP at the coarse-grained region graph level to further boost its\nperformance.\n", "  The next generation of large sky photometric surveys will finally be able to\nuse arc statistics as a cosmological probe. Here we present the first of a\nseries of papers on this topic. In particular, we study how arc counts are\nsensitive to the variation of two cosmological parameters: the (total) matter\ndensity parameter, $\\Omega_m$, and the normalisation of the primordial power\nspectrum, expressed in terms of $\\sigma_8$. Both these parameters influence the\nabundances of collapsed structures and their internal structure. We compute the\nexpected number of gravitational arcs with various length-to-width ratios in\nmock light cones, by varying these cosmological parameters in the ranges\n$0.1\\leq\\Omega_m\\leq0.5$ and $0.6\\leq\\sigma_8\\leq 1$. We find that the arc\ncounts dependence on $\\Omega_m$ and $\\sigma_8$ is similar, but not identical,\nto that of the halo counts. We investigate how the precision of the constraints\non the cosmological parameters based on arc counts depends on the survey area.\nWe find that the constraining power of arc statistics degrades critically only\nfor surveys covering an area smaller than $10\\%$ of the whole sky. Finally, we\nconsider the case in which the search for arcs is done only in frames where\ngalaxy clusters have been previously identified. Adopting the selection\nfunction for galaxy clusters expected to be detected from photometric data in\nfuture wide surveys, we find that less than $10\\%$ of the arcs will be missed,\nwith only a small degradation of the corresponding cosmological constraints.\n", "  A minimum dominating set for a digraph (directed graph) is a smallest set of\nvertices such that each vertex either belongs to this set or has at least one\nparent vertex in this set. We solve this hard combinatorial optimization\nproblem approximately by a local algorithm of generalized leaf removal and by a\nmessage-passing algorithm of belief propagation. These algorithms can construct\nnear-optimal dominating sets or even exact minimum dominating sets for random\ndigraphs and also for real-world digraph instances. We further develop a core\npercolation theory and a replica-symmetric spin glass theory for this problem.\nOur algorithmic and theoretical results may facilitate applications of\ndominating sets to various network problems involving directed interactions.\n", "  Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) has been widely applied to measure\nbone mineral density (BMD) and soft-tissue composition of human body. However,\nthe use of DEXA is greatly limited for low-Z materials such as soft tissues due\nto their weak absorption. While X-ray phase-contrast imaging (XPCI) shows\nsignificantly improved contrast in comparison with the conventional standard\nabsorption-based X-ray imaging for soft tissues. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel X-ray phase-contrast method to measure the area density of low-Z\nmaterials, including a single-energy method and a dual-energy method. The\nsingle-energy method is for the area density calculation of one low-Z material,\nwhile the dual-energy method is aiming to calculate the area densities of two\nlow-Z materials simultaneously. Comparing the experimental and simulation\nresults with the theoretic ones, the new method proves to have the potential to\nreplace DEXA in area density measurement. The new method sets the prerequisites\nfor future precise and low-dose area density calculation method of low-Z\nmaterials.\n", "  The consequences of anthropogenic climate change are extensively debated\nthrough scientific papers, newspaper articles, and blogs. Newspaper articles\nmay lack accuracy, while the severity of findings in scientific papers may be\ntoo opaque for the public to understand. Social media, however, is a forum\nwhere individuals of diverse backgrounds can share their thoughts and opinions.\nAs consumption shifts from old media to new, Twitter has become a valuable\nresource for analyzing current events and headline news. In this research, we\nanalyze tweets containing the word \"climate\" collected between September 2008\nand July 2014. Through use of a previously developed sentiment measurement tool\ncalled the Hedonometer, we determine how collective sentiment varies in\nresponse to climate change news, events, and natural disasters. We find that\nnatural disasters, climate bills, and oil-drilling can contribute to a decrease\nin happiness while climate rallies, a book release, and a green ideas contest\ncan contribute to an increase in happiness. Words uncovered by our analysis\nsuggest that responses to climate change news are predominately from climate\nchange activists rather than climate change deniers, indicating that Twitter is\na valuable resource for the spread of climate change awareness.\n", "  The electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) phenomenon has been\ninvestigated in a $\\Lambda$-system of the $^{87}$Rb D$_1$ line in an external\ntransverse magnetic field. Two spectroscopic cells having strongly different\nvalues of the relaxation rates $\\gamma_{rel}$ are used: a Rb cell with\nantirelaxation coating ($L\\sim$1 cm) and a Rb nanometric-thin cell (nano-cell)\nwith thickness of the atomic vapor column $L$=795nm. For the EIT in the\nnano-cell, we have the usual EIT resonances characterized by a reduction in the\nabsorption (i.e. dark resonance (DR)), whereas for the EIT in the Rb cell with\nan antirelaxation coating, the resonances demonstrate an increase in the\nabsorption (i.e. bright resonances). We suppose that such unusual behavior of\nthe EIT resonances (i.e. the reversal of the sign from DR to BR) is caused by\nthe influence of alignment process. The influence of alignment strongly depends\non the configuration of the coupling and probe frequencies as well as on the\nconfiguration of the magnetic field.\n", "  By using the reduction technique to impulsive differential equations [1], we\nrigorously prove the presence of chaos in dynamic equations on time scales\n(DETS). The results of the present study are based on the Li-Yorke definition\nof chaos. This is the first time in the literature that chaos is obtained for\nDETS. An illustrative example is presented by means of a Duffing equation on a\ntime scale.\n", "  In this paper, we present an experimental study on plastic deformation and\ndamage of polycrystalline pure Ti, as well as modeling of the observed\nbehavior. From the mechanical characterization data, it can be concluded that\nthe material displays anisotropy and tension-compression asymmetry. As concerns\ndamage, the X-ray tomography measurements conducted reveal that damage\ndistribution and evolution in this HCP Ti material is markedly different than\nin a typical FCC material such as copper. Stewart and Cazacu (2011) anisotropic\nelastic/plastic damage model is used to describe the behavior. All material\nparameters involved in this model have a clear physical significance, being\nrelated to plastic properties, and are determined based on very few simple\nmechanical tests. It is shown that this model predicts correctly the anisotropy\nin plastic deformation, and its strong influence on damage distribution and\ndamage accumulation in Ti. Specifically, for a smooth axisymmetric specimen\nsubject to uniaxial tension, damage initiates at the center of the specimen and\nis diffuse; the level of damage close to failure is very low. On the other\nhand, for a notched specimen subject to the same loading, the model predicts\nthat damage initiates at the outer surface of the specimen, and further grows\nfrom the outer surface to the center of the specimen, which corroborates with\nthe in-situ tomography data.\n", "  Due to the exponential high gravitational red shift near the event horizon of\na black hole, it might appear that the Hawking radiation would be highly\nsensitive to some unknown high energy physics. To study effects of any unknown\nphysics at the Planck scale on the Hawking radiation, the dispersive field\ntheory models have been proposed, which are variations of Unruh's sonic black\nhole analogy. In this paper, we use the Hamilton-Jacobi method to investigate\nthe dispersive field theory models. The preferred frame is the free-fall frame\nof the black hole. The dispersion relation adopted agrees with the relativistic\none at low energy but is modified near the Planck mass $m_{p}$. The corrections\nto the Hawking temperature are calculated for massive and charged particles to\n$\\mathcal{O}\\left( m_{p}^{-2}\\right) $ and neutral and massless particles with\n$\\lambda=0$ to all orders. The Hawking temperature of radiation agrees with the\nstandard one at the leading order. After the spectrum of radiation near the\nhorizon is obtained, we use the brick wall model to compute the thermal entropy\nof a massless scalar field near the horizon of a 4D spherically symmetric black\nhole and a 2D one. Finally, the luminosity of a Schwarzschild black hole is\ncalculated by using the geometric optics approximation.\n", "  In this article the notion of metabolic turnover is revisited in the light of\nrecent results of out-of-equilibrium thermodynamics. By means of Monte Carlo\nmethods we perform an exact uniform sampling of the steady state fluxes in a\ngenome scale metabolic network of E Coli from which we infer the metabolites\nturnover times. However the latter are inferred from net fluxes, and we argue\nthat this approximation is not valid for enzymes working nearby thermodynamic\nequilibrium. We recalculate turnover times from total fluxes by performing an\nenergy balance analysis of the network and recurring to the fluctuation\ntheorem. We find in many cases values one of order of magnitude lower, implying\na faster picture of intermediate metabolism.\n", "  We present the uncertainty relation for the characteristic functions (ChUR)\nof the quantum mechanical position and momentum probability distributions. This\ninequality is more general than the Heisenberg Uncertainty Relation, and is\nsaturated in two extremal cases for wavefunctions described by periodic Dirac\ncombs. We further discuss a broad spectrum of applications of the ChUR, in\nparticular, we constrain quantum optical measurements involving general\ndetection apertures and provide the uncertainty relation that is relevant for\nLoop Quantum Cosmology. A method to measure the characteristic function\ndirectly using an auxiliary qubit is also briefly discussed.\n", "  The modification of Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) method with Riemann\nSolver is called Godunov SPH. We further extend the Godunov SPH to the\ndescription of a medium with negative pressure. Under certain circumstances,\nthe SPH method shows an unphysical instability that results in particle\nclustering. This instability is called the tensile instability. The tensile\ninstability occurs in positive pressure regions in a regular fluid if a very\nlarge number of neighbor particles are used with certain shapes of kernel\nfunctions, and it is significant in negative pressure regions that emerge in\nstretched elastic bodies. We must suppress the tensile instability in SPH for\ncalculations of elastic bodies. In this study, we develop a new technique to\nremove the tensile instability by extending the Godunov SPH method and\nconducting a linear stability analysis of the equation of motion for the\nextended method. We find that the tensile instability can be suppressed by\nchoosing an appropriate order of interpolation in the equation of motion of the\nGodunov SPH method. We also derive an analytic solution for a Riemann solver\nfor a simple equation of state of an elastic body, and construct a Godunov SPH\nmethod for the equation of state that allows negative pressure.\n", "  It is known that in a hydrodynamic Taylor-Couette system uniform rotation or\na rotation law with positive shear ('super-rotation') are linearly stable. It\nis also known that a conducting fluid under the presence of a sufficiently\nstrong axial electric-current becomes unstable against nonaxisymmetric\ndisturbances. It is thus suggestive that a cylindric pinch formed by a\nhomogeneous axial electric-current is stabilized by rotation laws with\n$d\\Omega/dR \\geq 0$. However, for magnetic Prandtl numbers Pm$\\neq 1$ and for\nslow rotation also rigid rotation and super-rotation support the instability by\nlowering their critical Hartmann numbers. For super-rotation in narrow gaps and\nfor modest rotation rates this double-diffusive instability even exists for\ntoroidal magnetic fields with rather arbitrary radial profiles, the\ncurrent-free profile $B_\\phi\\propto 1/R$ included. For rigid rotation and for\nsuper-rotation the sign of the azimuthal drift of the nonaxisymmetric\nhydromagnetic instability pattern strongly depends on the magnetic Prandtl\nnumber. The pattern counterrotates with the flow for Pm$\\ll 1$ and it corotates\nfor Pm$\\gg 1$ while for rotation laws with negative shear the instability\npattern migrates in the direction of the basic rotation for all Pm.\n  An axial electric-current of minimal 3.6 kAmp flowing inside or outside the\ninner cylinder suffices to realize the double-diffusive instability for\nsuper-rotation in experiments using liquid sodium as the conducting fluid\nbetween the rotating cylinders. The limit is 11 kAmp if a gallium alloy is\nused.\n", "  We propose a new extragalactic but non-cosmological explanation for fast\nradio bursts (FRBs) based on very young pulsars in supernova remnants. Within a\nfew hundred years of a core-collapse supernova the ejecta is confined within\n$\\sim$1 pc, providing a high enough column density of free electrons for the\nobserved 375-1600 pc cm$^{-3}$ of dispersion measure (DM). By extrapolating a\nCrab-like pulsar to its infancy in an environment like that of SN 1987A, we\nhypothesize such an object could emit supergiant pulses sporadically which\nwould be bright enough to be seen at a few hundred megaparsecs. We hypothesize\nthat such supergiant pulses would preferentially occur early in the pulsar's\nlife when the free electron density is still high, which is why we do not see\nlarge numbers of moderate DM FRBs ($\\lesssim300$ pc cm$^{-3}$). In this\nscenario Faraday rotation at the source gives rotation measures (RMs) much\nlarger than the expected cosmological contribution. If the emission were\npulsar-like, then the polarization vector could swing over the duration of the\nburst, which is not expected from non-rotating objects. In this model, the\nscattering, large DM, and commensurate RM all come from one place which is not\nthe case for the cosmological interpretation. The model also provides testable\npredictions of the flux distribution and repeat rate of FRBs, and could be\nfurther verified by spatial coincidence with optical supernovae of the past\nseveral decades and cross-correlation with nearby galaxy maps.\n", "  Supersymmetry (SUSY) is an attractive extension of the Standard Model (SM) of\nparticle physics which solves the SM hierarchy problem. Motivated by the\ntheoretical $\\mu$-term problem of the Minimal Supersymmetric Model (MSSM), the\nNext-to MSSM (NMSSM) can also account for experimental deviations from the SM\nlike the anomalous muon magnetic moment and the dark matter relic density.\nNatural SUSY, motivated by naturalness considerations, exhibits small fine\ntuning and a characteristic phenomenology with light higgsinos, stops and\ngluinos. We describe a scan in NMSSM parameter space motivated by Natural SUSY\nand guided by the phenomenology of an NMSSM with a slightly broken Peccei-Quinn\nsymmetry and a lightly coupled singlet. We identify a scenario which survives\nexperimental constraints with a light singlet Higgs and a singlino lightest\nSUSY particle. We then discuss how the scenario is not presently excluded by\nsearches at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and which channels are promising\nfor discovery at the LHC and International Linear Collider.\n", "  Metasurfaces, and in particular those containing plasmonic-based metallic\nelements, constitute a particularly attractive set of materials. By means of\nmodern nanolithographic fabrication techniques, flat, ultrathin optical\nelements may be constructed. However, in spite of their strong optical\nnonlinearities, plasmonic metasurfaces have so far been investigated mostly in\nthe linear regime. Here we introduce full nonlinear phase control over\nplasmonic elements in metasurfaces. We show that for nonlinear interactions in\na phase-gradient nonlinear metasurface a new anomalous nonlinear phase matching\ncondition prevails, which is the nonlinear analog of the generalized Snell law\ndemonstrated for linear metasurfaces. This phase matching condition is very\ndifferent from the other known phase matching schemes. The subwavelength phase\ncontrol of optical nonlinearities provides a foundation for the design of flat\nnonlinear optical elements based on metasurfaces. Our demonstrated flat\nnonlinear elements (i.e. lenses) act as generators and manipulators of the\nfrequency-converted signal.\n", "  We report on the engineering of a non-dispersive (flat) energy band in a\ngeometrically frustrated lattice of micro-pillar optical cavities. By taking\nadvantage of the non-hermitian nature of our system, we achieve bosonic\ncondensation of exciton-polaritons into the flat band. Due to the infinite\neffective mass in such band, the condensate is highly sensitive to disorder and\nfragments into localized modes reflecting the elementary eigenstates produced\nby geometric frustration. This realization offers a novel approach to studying\ncoherent phases of light and matter under the controlled interplay of\nfrustration, interactions and dissipation.\n", "  Thin, solid bodies with metric symmetries admit a restricted form of\nreparameterization invariance. Their dynamical equilibria include motions with\nboth rigid and flowing aspects. On such configurations, a quantity is conserved\nalong the intrinsic coordinate corresponding to the symmetry. As an example of\nits utility, this conserved quantity is combined with linear and angular\nmomentum currents to construct solutions for the equilibria of a rotating,\nflowing string, for which it is akin to Bernoulli's constant.\n", "  The Brownian diffusion of micron-scale inclusions in freely suspended smectic\nA liquid crystal films a few nanometers thick and several millimeters in\ndiameter depends strongly on the air surrounding the film. Near atmospheric\npressure, the three-dimensionally coupled film/gas system is well described by\nHughes/Pailthorpe/White hydrodynamic theory but at lower pressure (p < 70\ntorr), the diffusion coefficient increases substantially, tending in high\nvacuum toward the two-dimensional limit where it is determined by film size. In\nthe absence of air, the films are found to be a nearly ideal physical\nrealization of a two-dimensional, incompressible Newtonian fluid.\n", "  We consider two infinite classes of ordinary difference equations admitting\nLax pair representation. Discrete equations in these classes are parameterized\nby two integers $k\\geq 0$ and $s\\geq k+1$. We describe the first integrals for\nthese two classes in terms of special discrete polynomials. We show an\nequivalence of two difference equations belonged to different classes\ncorresponding to the same pair $(k, s)$. We show that solution spaces\n$\\mathcal{N}^k_s$ of different ordinary difference equations with fixed value\nof $s+k$ are organized in chain of inclusions.\n", "  We introduce Copernicus Complexio (COCO), a high-resolution cosmological\nN-body simulation of structure formation in the $\\Lambda{\\rm CDM}{}$ model.\nCOCO follows an approximately spherical region of radius $\\sim 17.4h^{-1}\\,{\\rm\nMpc}$ embedded in a much larger periodic cube that is followed at lower\nresolution. The high resolution volume has a particle mass of\n$1.135\\times10^5h^{-1}{\\rm M}_{\\odot}$ (60 times higher than the Millennium-II\nsimulation). COCO gives the dark matter halo mass function over eight orders of\nmagnitude in halo mass; it forms $\\sim 60$ haloes of galactic size, each\nresolved with about 10 million particles. We confirm the power-law character of\nthe subhalo mass function, $\\bar{N}(>\\mu)\\propto\\mu^{-s}$, down to a reduced\nsubhalo mass $M_{sub}/M_{200}\\equiv\\mu=10^{-6}$, with a best-fit power-law\nindex, $s=0.94$, for hosts of mass $\\langle M_{200}\\rangle=10^{12}h^{-1}{\\rm\nM}_{\\odot}$. The concentration-mass relation of COCO haloes deviates from a\nsingle power law for masses $M_{200}<\\textrm{a few}\\times 10^{8}h^{-1}{\\rm\nM}_{\\odot}$, where it flattens, in agreement with results by Sanchez-Conde et\nal. The host mass invariance of the reduced maximum circular velocity function\nof subhaloes, $\\nu\\equiv V_{max}/V_{200}$, hinted at in previous simulations,\nis clearly demonstrated over five orders of magnitude in host mass. Similarly,\nwe find that the average, normalised radial distribution of subhaloes is\napproximately universal (i.e. independent of subhalo mass), as previously\nsuggested by the Aquarius simulations of individual haloes. Finally, we find\nthat at fixed physical subhalo size, subhaloes in lower mass hosts typically\nhave lower central densities than those in higher mass hosts.\n", "  The framework of the expansion by subgraphs is used to compute asymptotic\nexpansions for the vector and the tensor currents in the limit of large quark\nmasses. We use the results to obtain an estimate for the influence of heavy\nquarks on the nucleon electromagnetic and tensor form factors.\n", "  We study the Mott metal-insulator transition in the two-band Hubbard model\nwith different hopping amplitudes $t_1$ and $t_2$ for the two orbitals on the\ntwo-dimensional square lattice by using {\\it non-magnetic} variational wave\nfunctions, similarly to what has been considered in the limit of infinite\ndimensions by dynamical mean-field theory. We work out the phase diagram at\nhalf filling (i.e., two electrons per site) as a function of $R=t_2/t_1$ and\nthe on-site Coulomb repulsion $U$, for two values of the Hund's coupling $J=0$\nand $J/U=0.1$. Our results are in good agreement with previous dynamical\nmean-field theory calculations, demonstrating that the non-magnetic phase\ndiagram is only slightly modified from infinite to two spatial dimensions.\nThree phases are present: a metallic one, for small values of $U$, where both\norbitals are itinerant; a Mott insulator, for large values of $U$, where both\norbitals are localized because of the Coulomb repulsion; and the so-called\norbital-selective Mott insulator (OSMI), for small values of $R$ and\nintermediate $U$'s, where one orbital is localized while the other one is still\nitinerant. The effect of the Hund's coupling is two-fold: on one side, it\nfavors the full Mott phase over the OSMI; on the other side, it stabilizes the\nOSMI at larger values of $R$.\n", "  From pulsating stars to transiting exoplanets, the search for periodic\nsignals in K2 data, Kepler's 2-wheeled extension, is relevant to a long list of\nscientific goals. Systematics affecting K2 light curves due to the decreased\nspacecraft pointing precision inhibit the easy extraction of periodic signals\nfrom the data. We here develop a method for producing periodograms of K2 light\ncurves that are insensitive to pointing-induced systematics; the\nSystematics-Insensitive Periodogram (SIP). Traditional sine-fitting\nperiodograms use a generative model to find the frequency of a sinusoid that\nbest describes the data. We extend this principle by including systematic\ntrends, based on a set of 'Eigen light curves', following Foreman-Mackey et al.\n(2015), in our generative model as well as a sum of sine and cosine functions\nover a grid of frequencies. Using this method we are able to produce\nperiodograms with vastly reduced systematic features. The quality of the\nresulting periodograms are such that we can recover acoustic oscillations in\ngiant stars and measure stellar rotation periods without the need for any\ndetrending. The algorithm is also applicable to the detection of other periodic\nphenomena such as variable stars, eclipsing binaries and short-period exoplanet\ncandidates. The SIP code is available at https://github.com/RuthAngus/SIPK2.\n", "  The cellular basis for the adaptive immune response during antigen\nrecognition relies on a specialized protein interface known as the\nimmunological synapse (IS). Understanding the biophysical basis for protein\npatterning by deciphering the quantitative rules for their formation and motion\nis an important aspect of characterizing immune cell recognition and thence the\nrules for immune system activation. We propose a minimal mathematical model for\nthe physical basis of membrane protein patterning in the IS, which encompass\nmembrane mechanics, protein binding kinetics and motion, and fluid flow in the\nsynaptic cleft. Our theory leads to simple predictions for the spatial and\ntemporal scales of protein cluster formation, growth and arrest as a function\nof membrane stiffness, rigidity and kinetics of the adhesive proteins, and the\nfluid in the synaptic cleft. Numerical simulations complement these scaling\nlaws by quantifying the nucleation, growth and stabilization of proteins\ndomains on the size of the cell. Direct comparison with experiment shows that\npassive elastohydrodynamics and kinetics of protein binding in the synaptic\ncleft can describe the short-time formation and organization of protein\nclusters, without evoking any active processes in the cytoskeleton. Despite the\napparent complexity of the process, our analysis highlights the role of just\ntwo dimensionless parameters that characterize the spatial and temporal\nevolution of the protein pattern: a ratio of membrane elasticity to protein\nelasticity, and the ratio of a hydrodynamic time scale for fluid flow relative\nto the protein binding rate, and we present a simple phase diagram that\nencompasses the variety of patterns that can arise.\n", "  Electric response of an x-ray mirror enclosed in a gas flow ionization\nchamber was studied under the conditions of total external reflection for hard\nx-rays. It is shown that the electric response of the system as a function of\nthe incidence angle is defined by x-ray Fresnel transmissivity and\nphoton-electron attenuation properties of the mirror material. A simple\ninterpretation of quantum yield of the system is presented. The approach could\nserve as a basis for non-invasive in-situ diagnostics of hard x-ray optics,\neasy access to complementary x-ray transmissivity data in x-ray reflectivity\nexperiments and might also pave the way to advanced schemes for angle and\nenergy resolving x-ray detectors.\n", "  Digital signatures are widely used in electronic communications to secure\nimportant tasks such as financial transactions, software updates, and legal\ncontracts. The signature schemes that are in use today are based on public-key\ncryptography and derive their security from computational assumptions. However,\nit is possible to construct unconditionally secure signature protocols. In\nparticular, using quantum communication, it is possible to construct signature\nschemes with security based on fundamental principles of quantum mechanics.\nSeveral quantum signature protocols have been proposed, but none of them has\nbeen explicitly generalized to more than three participants, and their security\ngoals have not been formally defined. Here, we first extend the security\ndefinitions of Swanson and Stinson (2011) so that they can apply also to the\nquantum case, and introduce a formal definition of transferability based on\ndifferent verification levels. We then prove several properties that multiparty\nsignature protocols with information-theoretic security -- quantum or classical\n-- must satisfy in order to achieve their security goals. We also express two\nexisting quantum signature protocols with three parties in the security\nframework we have introduced. Finally, we generalize a quantum signature\nprotocol given in Wallden-Dunjko-Kent-Andersson (2015) to the multiparty case,\nproving its security against forging, repudiation and non-transferability.\nNotably, this protocol can be implemented using any point-to-point quantum key\ndistribution network and therefore is ready to be experimentally demonstrated.\n", "  There is no tree-level flavor changing neutral current (FCNC) in the standard\nmodel (SM) which contains only one Higgs doublet. If more Higgs doublets are\nintroduced for various reasons, the tree level FCNC would be inevitable except\nextra symmetry was imposed. Therefore FCNC processes are the excellent probes\nfor the physics beyond the SM (BSM). In this paper, we studied the lepton\nflavor violated (LFV) decay processes $h\\rightarrow\\mu\\tau$ and\n$\\tau\\rightarrow\\mu\\gamma$ induced by Higgs-$\\mu$-$\\tau$ vertex. For\n$\\tau\\rightarrow\\mu\\gamma$, its branching ratio is also related to the\n$ht\\bar{t}$, $h\\tau^+\\tau^-$ and $hW^+W^-$ vertices. We categorized the BSM\ninto two scenarios for the Higgs coupling strengths near or away from SM. For\nthe latter scenario, we took the spontaneously broken two Higgs doublet model\n(Lee model) as an example. We considered the constraints by recent data from\nLHC and B factories, and found that the measurements gave weak constraints. At\nLHC Run II, $h\\rightarrow\\mu\\tau$ will be confirmed or set stricter limit on\nits branching ratio. Accordingly,\n$\\textrm{Br}(\\tau\\rightarrow\\mu\\gamma)\\lesssim\\mathcal{O}(10^{-10}-10^{-8})$\nfor general chosen parameters. For the positive case,\n$\\tau\\rightarrow\\mu\\gamma$ can be discovered with $\\mathcal{O}(10^{10})$ $\\tau$\npair samples at SuperB factory, Super $\\tau$-charm factory and new Z-factory.\nThe future measurements for $\\textrm{Br}(h\\rightarrow\\mu\\tau)$ and\n$\\textrm{Br}(\\tau\\rightarrow\\mu\\gamma)$ will be used to distinguish these two\nscenarios or set strict constraints on the correlations among different Higgs\ncouplings, please see Table II in the text for details.\n", "  Fourier transform spectroscopy based on incoherent light sources is a\nwell-established tool in research fields from molecular spectroscopy and\natmospheric monitoring to material science and biophysics. It provides\nbroadband molecular spectra and information about the molecular structure and\ncomposition of absorptive media. However, the spectral resolution is\nfundamentally limited by the maximum delay range ({\\Delta}$_{max}$) of the\ninterferometer, so acquisition of high-resolution spectra implies long\nmeasurement times and large instrument size. We overcome this limit by\ncombining the Fourier transform spectrometer with an optical frequency comb and\nmeasuring the intensities of individual comb lines by precisely matching the\n{\\Delta}$_{max}$ to the comb line spacing. This allows measurements of\nabsorption lines narrower than the nominal (optical path-limited) resolution\nwithout ringing effects from the instrumental lineshape and reduces the\nacquisition time and interferometer length by orders of magnitude.\n", "  By assuming that the scalar meson $K_0^*(1430)$ belongs to the first excited\nstates or the lowest lying ground states, we study the pure annihilation-type\ndecays $B \\to K_0^{*\\pm}(1430)K^{(*)\\mp}$ in the QCD factorization approach.\nWithin the standard model, the branching fractions are at the order of\n$10^{-8}-10^{-7}$, which is possible to be measured in the ongoing LHCb\nexperiment or forthcoming Belle-II experiment. We also study these decays in\nthe family non-universal $Z^\\prime$ model. The results show that if\n$m_{Z^\\prime}\\approx 600\\mathrm{GeV}$ ($\\zeta=0.02$), both the branching\nfractions and $CP$ asymmetries of $\\overline B^0\\to K_0^{*+}(1430)K^-$ could be\nchanged remarkably, which provides us a place for probing the effect of new\nphysics. These results could be used to constrain the parameters of $Z^\\prime$\nmodel.\n", "  We obtain the solution of the Dirac equation in (2+1) dimensions in the\npresence of a constant magnetic field normal to the plane together with a\ntwo-dimensional Dirac-oscillator potential coupling. We study the energy\nspectrum of graphene quantum dot (QD) defined by electrostatic gates. We give\ndiscussions of our results based on different physical settings, whether the\ncyclotron frequency is similar or larger/smaller compared to the oscillator\nfrequency. This defines an effective magnetic field that produces the effective\nquantized Landau levels. We study analytically such field in gate-tunable\ngraphene QD and show that our structure allow us to control the valley\ndegeneracy. Finally, we compare our results with already published work and\nalso discuss the possible applications of such QD.\n", "  We describe in detail a previously published measurement of CP violation\ninduced by B0-anti B0 oscillations, based on an integrated luminosity of 425.7\nfb-1 collected by the BABAR experiment at the PEPII collider. We apply a novel\ntechnique to a sample of about 6 million B0bar -> D*+ l- nubar decays selected\nwith partial reconstruction of the D*+ meson. The charged lepton identifies the\nflavor of one B meson at its decay time, the flavor of the other B is\ndetermined by kaon tagging. We determine a CP violating asymmetry ACP = (0.0006\n+- 0.0017 + 0.0038 - 0.0032). This measurement is consistent and competitive\nwith those obtained at the B factories with dilepton events.\n", "  We conjecture a precise relationship between the Schur limit of the\nsuperconformal index of four-dimensional $\\mathcal{N}=2$ field theories, which\ncounts local operators, and the spectrum of BPS particles on the Coulomb\nbranch. We verify this conjecture for the special case of free field theories,\n$\\mathcal{N}=2$ QED, and $SU(2)$ gauge theory coupled to fundamental matter.\nAssuming the validity of our proposal, we compute the Schur index of all\nArgyres-Douglas theories. Our answers match expectations from the connection of\nSchur operators with two-dimensional chiral algebras. Based on our results we\npropose that the chiral algebra of the generalized Argyres-Douglas theory\n$(A_{k-1},A_{N-1})$ with $k$ and $N$ coprime, is the vacuum sector of the\n$(k,k+N)$ $W_{k}$ minimal model, and that the Schur index is the associated\nvacuum character.\n", "  We consider a phantom chain model of polymer with internal friction in a\nharmonic confinement and extend it to take care of effects of solvent quality\nfollowing a mean field approach where an exponent $\\nu$ is introduced. The\nmodel termed as \"Solvent Dependent Compacted Rouse with Internal Friction\n(SDCRIF)\" is then used to calculate the reconfiguration time of a chain that\nrelates to recent F\\\"{o}rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) studies on\nfolded and intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and can account for the\neffects of solvent quality as well as the denaturant concentration on the\nreconfiguration dynamics. Following an ansatz that relates the strength of the\nharmonic confinement ($k_c$) with the internal friction of the chain\n($\\xi_{int}$), SDCRIF can convincingly reproduce the experimental data and\nexplain how the denaturant can change the time scale for the internal friction.\nIt can also predict near zero internal friction in case of IDPs. In addition,\nour calculations show that the looping time as well as the reconfiguration time\nscales with the chain length $N$ as $\\sim N^\\alpha$, where $\\alpha$ depends\nweakly on the internal friction but has rather stronger dependence on the\nsolvent quality. In absence of any internal friction, $\\alpha=2\\nu+1$ and it\ngoes down in presence of internal friction, but looping slows down in general.\nOn the contrary, poorer the solvent, faster the chain reconfigures and forms\nloop, even though one expects high internal friction in the collapsed state.\nHowever, if the internal friction is too high then the looping and\nreconfiguration dynamics become slow even in poor solvent.\n", "  We consider a class of decoding algorithms that are applicable to error\ncorrection for both Abelian and non-Abelian anyons. This class includes\nmultiple algorithms that have recently attracted attention, including the\nBravyi-Haah RG decoder. They are applied to both the problem of single shot\nerror correction (with perfect syndrome measurements) and that of active error\ncorrection (with noisy syndrome measurements). For Abelian models we provide a\nthreshold proof in both cases, showing that there is a finite noise threshold\nunder which errors can be arbitrarily suppressed when any decoder in this class\nis used. For non-Abelian models such a proof is found for the single shot case.\nThe means by which decoding may be performed for active error correction of\nnon-Abelian anyons is studied in detail. Differences with the Abelian case are\ndiscussed.\n", "  Myxococcus xanthus cells self-organize into aligned groups, clusters, at\nvarious stages of their lifecycle. Formation of these clusters is crucial for\nthe complex dynamic multi-cellular behavior of these bacteria. However, the\nmechanism underlying the cell alignment and clustering is not fully understood.\nMotivated by studies of clustering in self-propelled rods, we hypothesized that\nM. xanthus cells can align and form clusters through pure mechanical\ninteractions among cells and between cells and substrate. We test this\nhypothesis using an agent-based simulation framework in which each agent is\nbased on the biophysical model of an individual M. xanthus cell. We show that\nmodel agents, under realistic cell flexibility values, can align and form cell\nclusters but only when periodic reversals of cell directions are suppressed.\nHowever, by extending our model to introduce the observed ability of cells to\ndeposit and follow slime trails, we show that effective trail-following leads\nto clusters in reversing cells. Furthermore, we conclude that mechanical cell\nalignment combined with slime-trail-following is sufficient to explain the\ndistinct clustering behaviors observed for wild-type and non-reversing M.\nxanthus mutants in recent experiments. Our results are robust to variation in\nmodel parameters, match the experimentally observed trends and can be applied\nto understand surface motility patterns of other bacterial species.\n", "  The relevance of the quasi-two-dimensional spin-1/2 frustrated quantum\nantiferromagnet due to its possibility of modelling the high-temperature\nsuperconducting parent compounds has resulted in numerous theoretical and\nexperimental studies. This paper presents a detailed research of the influence\nof the varying exchange interactions on the model magnetic properties within\nthe framework of self-consistent spin-wave theory based on Dyson-Maleev\nrepresentation. Beside the nearest neighbour interaction within the plane, the\nplanar frustration up to the third nearest neighbours, cyclic interaction and\nthe interlayer coupling are taken into account. The detailed description of the\nelementary spin excitations, staggered magnetization, spin-wave velocity\nrenormalization factor and ground-state energy is given. The results are\ncompared to the predictions of the linear spin-wave theory and when possible\nalso to the second-order perturbative spin-wave expansion results. Finally,\nhaving at our disposal improved experimental results for the in-plane spin-wave\ndispersion in high-$T_c$ copper oxide $\\mbox{La}_2\\mbox{CuO}_4$, the\nself-consistent spin-wave theory is applied to that compound in order to\ncorrect earlier obtained set of exchange parameters and high temperature\nspin-wave dispersion.\n", "  In the late stages of nuclear burning for massive stars ($M>8~M_{\\sun}$), the\nproduction of neutrino-antineutrino pairs through various processes becomes the\ndominant stellar cooling mechanism. As the star evolves, the energy of these\nneutrinos increases and in the days preceding the supernova a significant\nfraction of emitted electron anti-neutrinos exceeds the energy threshold for\ninverse beta decay on free hydrogen. This is the golden channel for liquid\nscintillator detectors because the coincidence signature allows for significant\nreductions in background signals. We find that the kiloton-scale liquid\nscintillator detector KamLAND can detect these pre-supernova neutrinos from a\nstar with a mass of $25~M_{\\sun}$ at a distance less than 690~pc with 3$\\sigma$\nsignificance before the supernova. This limit is dependent on the neutrino mass\nordering and background levels. KamLAND takes data continuously and can provide\na supernova alert to the community.\n", "  The opening of the pseudogap in underdoped cuprates breaks up the Fermi\nsurface, which may lead to a breakup of the d-wave order parameter into two\nsubband amplitudes and a low energy Leggett mode due to phase fluctuations\nbetween them. This causes a large increase in the temperature range of\nsuperconducting fluctuations with an overdamped Leggett mode. Almost resonant\nscattering of inter-subband phonons to a state with a pair of Leggett modes\ncauses anomalously strong damping. In the ordered state, the Leggett mode\ndevelops a finite energy, suppressing the anomalous phonon damping but leading\nto an anomaly in the phonon dispersion.\n", "  Falling liquid films become unstable due to inertial effects when the fluid\nlayer is sufficiently thick or the slope sufficiently steep. This free surface\nflow of a single fluid layer has industrial applications including coating and\nheat transfer, which benefit from smooth and wavy interfaces, respectively.\nHere we discuss how the dynamics of the system are altered by feedback controls\nbased on observations of the interface height, and supplied to the system via\nthe perpendicular injection and suction of fluid through the wall. In this\nstudy, we model the system using both Benney and weighted-residual models that\naccount for the fluid injection through the wall. We find that feedback using\ninjection and suction is a remarkably effective control mechanism: the controls\ncan be used to drive the system towards arbitrary steady states and travelling\nwaves, and the qualitative effects are independent of the details of the flow\nmodelling. Furthermore, we show that the system can still be successfully\ncontrolled when the feedback is applied via a set of localised actuators and\nonly a small number of system observations are available, and that this is\npossible using both static (where the controls are based on only the most\nrecent set of observations) and dynamic (where the controls are based on an\napproximation of the system which evolves over time) control schemes. This\nstudy thus provides a solid theoretical foundation for future experimental\nrealisations of the control of falling liquid films.\n", "  We consider a \\textit{PT}-symmetric cubic oscillator with an imaginary double\nwell. We prove the existence of an infinite number of level crossings with a\ndefinite selection rule. Decreasing the positive parameter $\\hbar$ from large\nvalues, at a value $\\hbar_n$ we find the crossing of the pair of levels\n$(E_{2n+1}(\\hbar),E_{2n}(\\hbar))$ becoming the pair of levels\n$(E_n^+(\\hbar),E_n^-(\\hbar))$. For large parameters, a level is a holomorphic\nfunction $E_m(\\hbar)$ with different semiclassical behaviors, $E_j^\\pm(\\hbar),$\nalong different paths. The corresponding $m$-nodes delocalized state\n$\\psi_m(\\hbar)$ behaves along the same paths as the semiclassical $j$-nodes\nstates $\\psi_j^\\pm(\\hbar),$ localized at one of the wells $x_\\pm$ respectively.\nIn particular, if the crossing parameter $\\hbar_n$ is by-passed from above, the\nlevels $E_{2n+(1/2)\\pm(1/2)}(\\hbar)$ have respectively the semiclassical\nbehaviors of the levels $E_n^\\mp(\\hbar)$ along the real axis. These results are\nobtained by the control of the nodes. There is evidence that the parameters\n$\\hbar_n$ accumulate at zero and the accumulation point of the corresponding\nenergies is aninstability point of a subset of the Stokes complex called the\nmonochord, consisting of the vibrating string and the sound board.\n", "  We report on a thermoelectric investigation of the stripe and superconducting\nphases of the cuprate La$_{2-x}$Ba$_{x}$CuO$_{4}$ near the $x=1/8$ doping known\nto host stable stripes. We use the doping and magnetic field dependence of\nfield-symmetric Nernst effect features to delineate the phenomenology of these\nphases. Our measurements are consistent with prior reports of time-reversal\nsymmetry breaking signatures above the superconducting $T_{{\\rm c}}$, and\ncrucially detect a sharp, robust, field-invariant peak at the stripe charge\norder temperature, $T_{{\\rm {\\scriptscriptstyle CO}}}$. Our observations\nsuggest the onset of a nontrivial charge ordered phase at $T_{{\\rm\n{\\scriptscriptstyle CO}}}$, and the subsequent presence of spontaneously\ngenerated vortices over a broad temperature range before the emergence of bulk\nsuperconductivity in LBCO.\n", "  Interference effects play an important role in Electroweak Physics. They are\nresponsible for the restoration of unitarity al large energies. When, as is\noften the case, higher order corrections are only available for some particular\nsubamplitude, interferences need to be carefully computed in order to obtain\nthe best theoretical prediction. In the new proposal to estimate the total\nHiggs width from the off shell cross section, the interference between the\nHiggs signal and the background is essential. It has been recently pointed out\nin gluon fusion that whenever more than one neutral, CP even, scalars are\npresent in the spectrum large cancellations can occur. We extend these studies\nto Vector Boson Scattering, examining interference effects in the Higgs sector\nin the Standard Model and its one Higgs Singlet extension.\n", "  We study excitation spectra of BPS-saturated topological solutions -- the\nkinks -- of the $\\varphi^8$ scalar field model in $(1+1)$ dimensions, for three\ndifferent choices of the model parameters. We demonstrate that some of these\nkinks have a vibrational mode, apart from the trivial zero (translational)\nexcitation. One of the considered kinks is shown to have three vibrational\nmodes. We perform a numerical calculation of the kink-kink scattering in one of\nthe considered variants of the $\\varphi^8$ model, and find the critical\ncollision velocity $v_{\\scriptsize \\mbox{cr}}$ that separates the different\ncollision regimes: inelastic bounce of the kinks at $v_{\\scriptsize\n\\mbox{in}}\\ge v_{\\scriptsize \\mbox{cr}}$, and capture at $v_{\\scriptsize\n\\mbox{in}}<v_{\\scriptsize \\mbox{cr}}$. We also observe escape windows at some\nvalues of $v_{\\scriptsize \\mbox{in}}<v_{\\scriptsize \\mbox{cr}}$ where the kinks\nescape to infinity after bouncing off each other two or more times. We analyse\nthe features of these windows and discuss their relation to the resonant energy\nexchange between the translational and the vibrational excitations of the\ncolliding kinks.\n", "  We present the irregular matrix model which has contains $\\mathcal{W}_3$ and\nVirasoro symmetry. The irregular matrix model is obtained using the colliding\nlimit of the Toda field theories and produces the inner product between\nirregular modules of $\\mathcal{W}_3$ symmetry. We evaluate the partition\nfunction using the flow equation which is the realization of the Virasoro and\n$\\mathcal{W}$-symmetry.\n", "  We investigate the transmission properties of quasiperiodic or aperiodic\nstructures based on graphene arranged according to the Cantor sequence. In\nparticular, we have found self-similar behaviour in the transmission spectra,\nand most importantly, we have calculated the scalability of the spectra. To do\nthis, we implement and propose scaling rules for each one of the fundamental\nparameters: generation number, height of the barriers and length of the system.\nWith this in mind we have been able to reproduce the reference transmission\nspectrum, applying the appropriate scaling rule, by means of the scaled\ntransmission spectrum. These scaling rules are valid for both normal and\noblique incidence, and as far as we can see the basic ingredients to obtain\nself-similar characteristics are: relativistic Dirac electrons, a self-similar\nstructure and the non-conservation of the pseudo-spin. This constitutes a\nreduction of the number of conditions needed to observe self-similarity in\ngraphene-based structures, see D\\'iaz-Guerrero et al. [D. S. D\\'iaz-Guerrero,\nL. M. Gaggero-Sager, I. Rodr\\'iguez-Vargas, and G. G. Naumis,\narXiv:1503.03412v1, 2015].\n", "  Nuclear modification factor $R_{AA}$ for large $p_T$ single hadron is studied\nin a next-to-leading order (NLO) perturbative QCD (pQCD) parton model with\nmedium-modified fragmentation functions (mFFs) due to jet quenching in\nhigh-energy heavy-ion collisions. The energy loss of the hard partons in the\nQGP is incorporated in the mFFs which utilize two most important parameters to\ncharacterize the transport properties of the hard parton jets: the jet\ntransport parameter $\\hat q_{0}$ and the mean free path $\\lambda_{0}$, both at\nthe initial time $\\tau_0$. A phenomenological study of the experimental data\nfor $R_{AA}(p_{T})$ is performed to constrain the two parameters with\nsimultaneous $\\chi^2/{\\rm d.o.f}$ fits to RHIC as well as LHC data. We obtain\nfor energetic quarks $\\hat q_{0}\\approx 1.1 \\pm 0.2$ GeV$^2$/fm and\n$\\lambda_{0}\\approx 0.4 \\pm 0.03$ fm in central $Au+Au$ collisions at\n$\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV, while $\\hat q_{0}\\approx 1.7 \\pm 0.3$ GeV$^2$/fm, and\n$\\lambda_{0}\\approx 0.5 \\pm 0.05$ fm in central $Pb+Pb$ collisions at\n$\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=2.76$ TeV. Numerical analysis shows that the best fit favors a\nmultiple scattering picture for the energetic jets propagating through the bulk\nmedium, with a moderate averaged number of gluon emissions. Based on the best\nconstraints for $\\lambda_{0}$ and $\\tau_0$, the estimated value for the\nmean-squared transverse momentum broadening is moderate which implies that the\nhard jets go through the medium with small reflection.\n", "  We cast observable measure of quantum coherence or asymmetry as a resource to\ncontrol the quantum speed limit (QSL) for unitary evolutions. For non-unitary\nevolutions, QSL depends on that of the state of the system and environment\ntogether. We show that the product of the time bound and the coherence\n(asymmetry) or the quantum part of the uncertainty behaves in a geometric way\nunder partial elimination and classical mixing of states. These relations give\na new insight to the quantum speed limit. We also show that our bound is\nexperimentally measurable and is tighter than various existing bounds in the\nliterature.\n", "  Four classic criteria used to the classification of complex flows are\ndiscussed here. These criteria are useful to identify regions of the flow\nrelated to shear, elongation or rigid-body motion. These usual criteria, namely\n$Q$, $\\Delta$, $\\lambda_{2}$ and $\\lambda_{cr}/\\lambda_{ci}$, use the fluid's\nrate-of-rotation tensor, which is known to vary with respect to a reference\nframe. The advantages of using objective (invariant with respect to a general\ntransformation on the reference frame) criteria are discussed in the present\nwork. In this connection, we construct versions of classic criteria replacing\nstandard vorticity, a non-objective quantity, by effective vorticity, a rate of\nrotation tensor with respect to the angular velocity of the eigenvectors of the\nstrain rate tensor. The classic criteria and their corresponding objective\nversions are applied to classify two complex flows: the transient ABC flow and\nthe flow through the abrupt 4:1 contraction. It is shown that the objective\nversions of the criteria provide richer information on the kinematics of the\nflow\n", "  This work addresses the resurgent properties of the cusp anomalous\ndimension's strong coupling expansion, obtained from the integral\nBeisert-Eden-Staudacher (BES) equation. This expansion is factorially\ndivergent, and its first nonperturbative corrections are related to the mass\ngap of the $O(6)$ $\\sigma$-model. The factorial divergence can also be analysed\nfrom a resurgence perspective. Building on the work of Basso and Korchemsky, a\ntransseries ansatz for the cusp anomalous dimension is proposed and the\ncorresponding expected large-order behaviour studied. One finds\nnon-perturbative phenomena in both the positive and negative real coupling\ndirections, which need to be included to address the analyticity conditions\ncoming from the BES equation. After checking the resurgence structure of the\nproposed transseries, it is shown that it naturally leads to an unambiguous\nresummation procedure, furthermore allowing for a strong/weak coupling\ninterpolation.\n", "  Lensing measurements of the shapes of dark matter halos can provide tests of\ngravity theories and possible dark matter interactions. We measure the\nquadrupole weak lensing signal from the elliptical halos of 70,000 SDSS\nLuminous Red Galaxies. We use a new estimator that nulls the spherical halo\nlensing signal, isolating the shear due to anisotropy in the dark matter\ndistribution. One of the two Cartesian components of our estimator is\ninsensitive to the primary systematic, a spurious alignment of lens and source\nellipticities, allowing us to make robust measurements of halo ellipticity. Our\nbest-fit value for the ellipticity of the surface mass density is $0.24 \\pm\n0.06$, which translates to an axis ratio of 0.78. We rule out the hypothesis of\nno ellipticity at the $4\\sigma$ confidence level, and ellipticity < 0.12 (axis\nratio > 0.89) at the $2\\sigma$ level. We discuss how our measurements of halo\nellipticity are revised to higher values using estimates of the misalignment of\nmass and light from simulations. Finally, we apply the same techniques to a\nsmaller sample of redMaPPer galaxy clusters and obtain a $3\\sigma$ measurement\nof cluster ellipticity. We discuss how the improved signal to noise properties\nof our estimator can enable studies of halo shapes for different galaxy\npopulations with upcoming surveys.\n", "  Ouyed et al. (1998) proposed Deuterium (DD) fusion at the core-mantle\ninterface of giant planets as a mechanism to explain their observed heat\nexcess. But rather high interior temperatures (~10^5 K) and a stratified D\nlayer are needed, making such a scenario unlikely. In this paper, we re-examine\nDD fusion, with the addition of screening effects pertinent to a deuterated\ncore containing ice and some heavy elements. This alleviates the extreme\ntemperature constraint and removes the requirement of a stratified D layer. As\nan application, we propose that, if their core temperatures are a few times\n10^4 K and core composition is chemically inhomogeneous, the observed inflated\nsize of some giant exoplanets (\"hot Jupiters\") may be linked to screened DD\nfusion occurring deep in the interior. Application of an analytic evolution\nmodel suggests that the amount of inflation from this effect can be important\nif there is sufficient rock-ice in the core, making DD fusion an effective\nextra internal energy source for radius inflation. The mechanism of screened DD\nfusion, operating in the above temperature range, is generally consistent with\nthe trend in radius anomaly with planetary equilibrium temperature $T_{\\rm\neq}$, and also depends on planetary mass. Although we do not consider the\neffect of incident stellar flux, we expect that a minimum level of irradiation\nis necessary to trigger core erosion and subsequent DD fusion inside the\nplanet. Since DD fusion is quite sensitive to the screening potential inferred\nfrom laboratory experiments, observations of inflated hot Jupiters may help\nconstrain screening effects in the cores of giant planets.\n", "  A novel integration method for quadratic vector fields was introduced by\nKahan in 1993. Subsequently, it was shown that Kahan's method preserves a\n(modified) measure and energy when applied to quadratic Hamiltonian vector\nfields. Here we generalize Kahan's method to cubic resp. higher degree\npolynomial vector fields and show that the resulting discretization also\npreserves modified versions of the measure and energy when applied to cubic\nresp. higher degree polynomial Hamiltonian vector fields.\n", "  Transverse momentum spectra of charged particle production in heavy-ion\ncollisions are considered in terms of a recently introduced Two Component\nparameterization combining exponential (\"soft\") and power-law (\"hard\")\nfunctional forms. The charged hadron densities calculated separately for them\nare plotted versus number of participating nucleons, $N_{part}$. The obtained\ndependences are discussed and the possible link between the two component\nparameterization introduced by the authors and the two component model\nhistorically used for the case of heavy-ion collisions is established. Next,\nthe variations of the parameters of the introduced approach with the center of\nmass energy and centrality are studied using the available data from RHIC and\nLHC experiments. The spectra shapes are found to show universal dependences on\n$N_{part}$ for all investigated collision energies.\n", "  It is by now well understood that quantum dissipative processes can be\nharnessed and turned into a resource for quantum-information processing tasks.\nIn this paper we demonstrate yet another way in which this is true by providing\na dissipation-assisted protocol for the simulation of general Markovian\ndynamics. More precisely, we show how a suitable coherent coupling of a quantum\nsystem to a set of Markovian dissipating qubits allows one to enact an\neffective Liouvillian generator of any Lindbladian form. This effective\ndynamical generator arises from high-order virtual-dissipative processes and\ngoverns the system dynamics exactly in the limit of infinitely fast\ndissipation. Applications to the simulation of collective decoherence are\ndiscussed as an illustration.\n", "  Fully entangled fraction is a definition for bipartite states, which is\ntightly related to bipartite maximally entangled states, and has clear\nexperimental and theoretical significance. In this work, we generalize it to\nmultipartite case, we call the generalized version multipartite fully entangled\nfraction (MFEF). MFEF measures the closeness of a state to GHZ states. The\nanalytical expressions of MFEF are very difficult to obtain except for very\nspecial states, however, we show that, the MFEF of any state is determined by a\nsystem of finite-order polynomial equations. Therefore, the MFEF can be\nefficiently numerically computed.\n", "  We first clarify through classical examples the status of the laws of\nmacroscopic physics as laws of large numbers. We next consider the mirrors\nmodel in a finite $d$-dimensional domain and connected to particles reservoirs\nat fixed chemical potentials. The dynamics is purely deterministic and\nnon-ergodic. We study the macroscopic current of particles in the stationary\nregime. We show first that when the size of the system goes to infinity, the\nbehaviour of the stationary current of particles is governed by the proportion\nof orbits crossing the system. This allows to formulate a necessary and\nsufficient condition on the distribution of the set of orbits that ensures the\nvalidity of Fick's law. Using this approach, we show that Fick's law relating\nthe stationary macroscopic current of particles to the concentration difference\nholds in three dimensions and above. The negative correlations between crossing\norbits play a key role in the argument.\n", "  We study the spin dynamics of individual black holes in a binary system. In\nparticular we focus on the polar precession of spins and the possibility of a\ncomplete flip of spins with respect to the orbital plane. We perform a full\nnumerical simulation that displays these characteristics. We evolve equal mass\nbinary spinning black holes for $t=20,000M$ from an initial proper separation\nof $d=25M$ down to merger after 48.5 orbits. We compute the gravitational\nradiation from this system and compare it to 3.5 post-Newtonian generated\nwaveforms finding close agreement. We then further use 3.5 post-Newtonian\nevolutions to show the extension of this spin {flip-flop} phenomenon to unequal\nmass binaries. We also provide analytic expressions to approximate the maximum\n{flip-flop} angle and frequency in terms of the binary spins and mass ratio\nparameters at a given orbital radius. Finally we discuss the effect this spin\n{flip-flop} would have on accreting matter and other potential observational\neffects.\n", "  An initial stress within a solid can arise to support external loads or from\nprocesses such as thermal expansion in inert matter or growth and remodelling\nin living materials. For this reason it is useful to develop a mechanical\nframework of initially stressed solids irrespective of how this stress formed.\nAn ideal way to do this is to write the free energy density $\\Psi=\n\\Psi(\\boldsymbol F, \\boldsymbol {\\tau})$ in terms of initial stress\n$\\boldsymbol \\tau$ and the elastic deformation gradient $\\boldsymbol F$. In\nthis paper we present a new constitutive condition for initially stressed\nmaterials, which we call the initial stress symmetry (ISS). We focus on two\nconsequences of this symmetry. First we examine how ISS restricts the free\nenergy density $\\Psi = \\Psi (\\boldsymbol F, \\boldsymbol \\tau) $ and present two\nexamples of $\\Psi (\\boldsymbol F, \\boldsymbol \\tau)$ that satisfy ISS. Second\nwe show that the initial stress can be derived from the Cauchy stress and the\nelastic deformation gradient. To illustrate we take an example from\nbiomechanics and calculate the optimal Cauchy stress within an artery subjected\nto internal pressure. We then use ISS to derive the optimal target residual\nstress for the material to achieve after remodelling.\n", "  Cosmological transverse momentum fields, whose directions are perpendicular\nto Fourier wave vectors, induce temperature anisotropies in the cosmic\nmicrowave background via the kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich (kSZ) effect. The\ntransverse momentum power spectrum contains the four-point function of density\nand velocity fields, $\\langle\\delta\\delta v v\\rangle$. In the post-reionization\nepoch, nonlinear effects dominate in the power spectrum. We use perturbation\ntheory and cosmological $N$-body simulations to calculate this nonlinearity. We\nderive the next-to-leading order expression for the power spectrum with a\nparticular emphasis on the connected term that has been ignored in the\nliterature. While the contribution from the connected term on small scales\n($k>0.1\\,h\\,\\rm{Mpc}^{-1}$) is subdominant relative to the unconnected term, we\nfind that its contribution to the kSZ power spectrum at $\\ell = 3000$ at $z<6$\ncan be as large as ten percent of the unconnected term, which would reduce the\nallowed contribution from the reionization epoch ($z>6$) by twenty percent. The\npower spectrum of transverse momentum on large scales is expected to scale as\n$k^2$ as a consequence of momentum conservation. We show that both the leading\nand the next-to-leading order terms satisfy this scaling. In particular, we\nfind that both of the unconnected and connected terms are necessary to\nreproduce $k^2$.\n", "  We investigate the regularization-scheme dependence of scattering amplitudes\nin massless QCD and find that the four-dimensional helicity scheme (FDH) and\ndimensional reduction (DRED) are consistent at least up to NNLO in the\nperturbative expansion if renormalization is done appropriately. Scheme\ndependence is shown to be deeply linked to the structure of UV and IR\nsingularities. We use jet and soft functions defined in soft-collinear\neffective theory (SCET) to efficiently extract the relevant anomalous\ndimensions in the different schemes. This result allows us to construct\ntransition rules for scattering amplitudes between different schemes (CDR, HV,\nFDH, DRED) up to NNLO in massless QCD. We also show by explicit calculation\nthat the hard, soft and jet functions in SCET are regularization-scheme\nindependent.\n", "  We derive, adopting a direct method, the luminosity function and the\nformation rate of long Gamma Ray Bursts through a complete, flux-limited,\nsample of Swift bursts which has a high level of completeness in redshift z\n(~82%). We parametrise the redshift evolution of the GRB luminosity as L =\nL_0(1+ z)^k and we derive k = 2.5, consistently with recent estimates. The\nde-evolved luminosity function of GRBs can be represented by a broken power law\nwith slopes a = -1.32 +- 0.21 and b = -1.84 +- 0.24 below and above,\nrespectively, a characteristic break luminosity L_0,b = 10^51.45+-0.15 erg/s.\nUnder the hypothesis of luminosity evolution we find that the GRB formation\nrate increases with redshift up to z~2, where it peaks, and then decreases in\nagreement with the shape of the cosmic star formation rate. We test the direct\nmethod through numerical simulations and we show that if it is applied to\nincomplete (both in redshift and/or flux) GRB samples it can misleadingly\nresult in an excess of the GRB formation rate at low redshifts.\n", "  Quantum mechanics, one of the most successful theories in the history of\nscience, was created to account for physical systems not describable by\nclassical physics. Though it is consistent with all experiments conducted thus\nfar, many of its core concepts (amplitudes, global phases, etc.) can not be\ndirectly accessed and its interpretation is still the subject of intense\ndebate, more than 100 years since it was introduced. So, a fundamental question\nis why this particular mathematical model is the one that nature chooses, if\nindeed it is the correct model. In the past two decades there has been a\nrenewed effort to determine what physical or informational principles define\nquantum mechanics. In this paper, recent attempts at establishing reasonable\nphysical principles are reviewed and their degree of success is tabulated. An\nalternative approach using joint quasi-probability distributions is shown to\nprovide a common basis of representing most of the proposed principles. It is\nargued that having a common representation of the principles can provide\nintuition and guidance to relate current principles or advance new principles.\nThe current state of affairs, along with some alternative views are discussed.\n", "  Damping of magnetization dynamics in a ferromagnetic metal is usually\ncharacterized by the Gilbert parameter alpha. Recent calculations of this\nquantity, using a formula due to Kambersky, find that it is infinite for a\nperfect crystal owing to an intraband scattering term which is of third order\nin the spin-orbit parameter xi This surprising result conflicts with recent\nwork by Costa and Muniz who study damping numerically by direct calculation of\nthe dynamical transverse spin susceptibility in the presence of spin-orbit\ncoupling. We resolve this inconsistency by following the Costa-Muniz approach\nfor a slightly simplified model where it is possible to calculate alpha\nanalytically. We show that to second order in the spin-orbit parameter xi one\nretrieves the Kambersky result for alpha, but to higher order one does not\nobtain any divergent intraband terms. The present work goes beyond that of\nCosta and Muniz by pointing out the necessity of including the effect of\nlong-range Coulomb interaction in calculating damping for large xi. A direct\nderivation of the Kambersky formula is given which shows clearly the\nrestriction of its validity to second order in xi so that no intraband\nscattering terms appear. This restriction has an important effect on the\ndamping over a substantial range of impurity content and temperature. The\nexperimental situation is discussed.\n", "  The problem of community detection is important as it helps in understanding\nthe spread of information in a social network. All real complex networks have\nan inbuilt structure which captures and characterizes the network dynamics\nbetween its nodes. Linkages are more likely to form between similar nodes,\nleading to the formation of some community structure which characterizes the\nnetwork dynamic. The more friends they have in common, the more the influence\nthat each person can exercise on the other.\n  We propose a disjoint community detection algorithm, $\\textit{NashDisjoint}$\nthat detects disjoint communities in any given network. We evaluate the\nalgorithm $\\textit{NashDisjoint}$ on the standard LFR benchmarks, and we find\nthat our algorithm works at least as good as that of the state of the art\nalgorithms for the mixing factors less than 0.55 in all the cases. We propose\nan overlapping community detection algorithm $\\textit{NashOverlap}$ to detect\nthe overlapping communities in any given network. We evaluate the algorithm\n$\\textit{NashOverlap}$ on the standard LFR benchmarks and we find that our\nalgorithm works far better than the state of the art algorithms in around 152\ndifferent scenarios, generated by varying the number of nodes, mixing factor\nand overlapping membership.\n  We run our algorithm $\\textit{NashOverlap}$ on DBLP dataset to detect the\nlarge collaboration groups and found very interesting results. Also, these\nresults of our algorithm on DBLP collaboration network are compared with the\nresults of the $\\textit{COPRA}$ algorithm and $\\textit{OSLOM}$.\n", "  We consider the effect of differing coefficients of static and dynamic\nfriction coefficients on the behaviour of contacts involving microslip. The\nclassic solutions of Cattaneo and Mindlin are unchanged if the transition in\ncoefficients is abrupt, but if it occurs over some small slip distance, the\nsolution has some mathematical similarities with those governing the normal\ntractions in adhesive contact problems. In particular, if the transition to\ndynamic slip occurs over a sufficiently small area, we can identify a `JKR'\napproximation, where the transition region is condensed to a line. A local\nsingularity in shear traction is then predicted, with a stress-intensity factor\nthat is proportional to the the square root of the local contact pressure and\nto a certain integral of the friction coefficient-slip distance relation. We\ncan also define an equivalent of the `small-scale yielding' criterion, which\nenables us to assess when the singular solution provides a good approximation.\nOne consequence of the results is that the static coefficient of friction\ndetermined from force measurements in experiments is significantly smaller than\nthe value that holds at the microscale.\n", "  We consider a one dimensional infinite acoustic chain of harmonic oscillators\nwhose dynamics is perturbed by a random exchange of velocities, such that the\nenergy and momentum of the chain are conserved. Consequently, the evolution of\nthe system has only three conserved quantities: volume, momentum and energy. We\nshow the existence of two space--time scales on which the en- ergy of the\nsystem evolves. On the hyperbolic scale (t$\\epsilon$--1,x$\\epsilon$--1) the\nlimits of the conserved quantities satisfy a Euler system of equa- tions, while\nthe thermal part of the energy macroscopic profile re- mains stationary.\nThermal energy starts evolving at a longer time scale, corresponding to the\nsuperdiffusive scaling (t$\\epsilon$--3/2, x$\\epsilon$--1) and follows a\nfractional heat equation. We also prove the diffusive scal- ing limit of the\nRiemann invariants - the so called normal modes, corresponding to the linear\nhyperbolic propagation.\n", "  The density classification problem is one of the simplest yet non-trivial\ncomputing tasks which seem to be ideally suitable for cellular automata (CA).\nUnfortunately, there exists no one-dimensional two-state CA which classifies\nbinary strings according to their densities. If, however, in place of simple\ncells one uses agents which change their behaviour from one rule to another\nafter a fixed number of iterations, the classification can be performed by the\ntraffic rule 184 and the majority rule 232. This two-rule solution cannot be\neasily generalized to two (or higher) dimensions, because it critically depends\non a kinetic phase transition occurring in the rule 184. No rule exhibiting\nanalogous transition is known in two dimensions, most likely because no such\nrule exists. We propose, therefore, to approach this problem form a slightly\ndifferent angle, namely by introducing a stochastic component into each of the\ntwo rules. If one precedes each iteration of rule 184 by the stochastic \"lane\nchanging rule,\" and each iteration of rule 232 by the stochastic \"crowd\navoidance\" rule, in the limit of infinitely many iterations the classification\ncan be performed correctly with probability 1. This solution can be described\neither in the language of CA, or using the paradigm of agents which move and\nproliferate on the 2D lattice, following probabilistic rules.\n", "  In all scalar extensions of the standard model of particle interactions, the\none Higgs boson responsible for electroweak symmetry breaking always mixes with\nother neutral scalars at tree level unless a symmetry prevents it. An\nunexplored important option is that the mixing may be radiative, and thus\nguaranteed to be small. Two first such examples are discussed. One is based on\nthe soft breaking of the discrete symmetry $Z_3$. The other starts with the\nnon-Abelian discrete symmetry $A_4$ which is then softly broken to $Z_3$, and\nresults in the emergence of an interesting dark-matter candidate together with\na light mediator for the dark matter to have its own long-range interaction.\n", "  Using the density matrix formalism, we prove an existence theorem of the\nperiodic steady-state for an arbitrary periodically-driven system. This state\nhas the same period as the modulated external influence, and it is realized as\nan asymptotic solution ($t$$\\to$$+\\infty$) due to relaxation processes. The\npresented derivation simultaneously contains a simple computational algorithm\nnon-using both Floquet and Fourier theories, i.e. our method automatically\nguarantees a full account of all frequency components. The description is\naccompanied by the examples demonstrating a simplicity and high efficiency of\nour method. In particular, for three-level $\\Lambda$-system we calculate the\nlineshape and field-induced shift of the dark resonance formed by the field\nwith periodically modulated phase. For two-level atom we obtain the analytical\nexpressions for signal of the direct frequency comb spectroscopy with\nrectangular light pulses. In this case it was shown the radical dependence of\nthe spectroscopy lineshape on pulse area. Moreover, the existence of\nquasi-forbidden spectroscopic zones, in which the Ramsey fringes are\nsignificantly reduced, is found. The obtained results have a wide area of\napplications in the laser physics and spectroscopy, and they can stimulate the\nsearch of new excitation schemes for atomic clock. Also our results can be\nuseful for many-body physics.\n", "  We present numerical calculations of lamellar phases of di-block copolymers\n(BCP) confined between two surfaces, where the top surface is flat and the\nbottom one is corrugated. The corrugated substrate is assumed to have a single\n$q$-mode of lateral undulations with a wavenumber q_s and amplitude R. We focus\non the effects of substrate roughness, parameterized by the dimensionless\nquantity, q_sR, on the relative stability between parallel and perpendicular\norientations of the lamellar phase. The competition between film confinement,\nenergy cost of elastic deformation and gain in surface energy induces a\nparallel-to-perpendicular transition of the BCP lamellae. Employing\nself-consistent field theory (SCFT), we study the critical substrate roughness\nvalue corresponding to this transition. The critical value increases as\nfunction of the surface preference towards one of the two BCP components, and\nas function of film thickness. But, it decreases with increasing values of the\nFlory-Huggins parameter. Our findings are equivalent to stating that the\ncritical value decreases as the BCP molecular weight or the natural BCP\nperiodicity increases. We further show that the rough substrate can overcome\nthe formation of parallel lamellae in cases where the top surface has a\npreference towards one of the two BCP components. Our results are in good\nagreement with previous experiments, and highlight the physical conditions\nbehind the perpendicular orientation of lamellar phases, as is desired in\nnanolithography and other industrial applications.\n", "  Localized contractile configurations or asters spontaneously appear and\ndisappear as emergent structures in the collective stochastic dynamics of\nactive polar actomyosin filaments. Passive parti- cles which (un)bind to the\nactive filaments get advected into the asters, forming transient clusters. We\nstudy the phase segregation of such passive advective scalars in a medium of\ndynamic asters, as a function of the aster density and the ratio of the rates\nof aster remodeling to particle diffusion. The dynamics of coarsening shows\nstrong violation of Porod behaviour, suggesting diffuse interfaces. The phase\nsegregated steady state shows strongly fluctuations characterized by\nmultiscaling and in- termittency. We expect these unique nonequilibrium\nfeatures to manifest in the actin-dependent molecular clustering at the cell\nsurface.\n", "  Structure of real networked systems, such as social relationship, can be\nmodeled as temporal networks in which each edge appears only at the prescribed\ntime. Understanding the structure of temporal networks requires quantifying the\nimportance of a temporal vertex, which is a pair of vertex index and time. In\nthis paper, we define two centrality measures of a temporal vertex based on the\nfastest temporal paths which use the temporal vertex. The definition is free\nfrom parameters and robust against the change in time scale on which we focus.\nIn addition, we can efficiently compute these centrality values for all\ntemporal vertices. Using the two centrality measures, we reveal that\ndistributions of these centrality values of real-world temporal networks are\nheterogeneous. For various datasets, we also demonstrate that a majority of the\nhighly central temporal vertices are located within a narrow time window around\na particular time. In other words, there is a bottleneck time at which most\ninformation sent in the temporal network passes through a small number of\ntemporal vertices, which suggests an important role of these temporal vertices\nin spreading phenomena.\n", "  Molecular spin crossover switches are the objects of intense theoretical and\nexperimental studies in recent years. This interest is due to the fact that\nthese systems allow one to control their spin state by applying an external\nphoto-, thermo-, piezo-, or magnetic stimuli. The greatest amount of research\nis currently devoted to the study the effect of the photoexcitation on the\nbi-stable states of spin crossover single molecular magnets (SMMs). The main\nlimitation of photo-induced bi-stable states is their short lifetime. In this\npaper we present the results of a study of the spin dynamics of the CoOEP\nmolecule in the Low Spin (LS) state and the High Spin (HS) state induced by\napplying the magnetic pulse of 36.8 T. We show that the spin switching in case\nof the HS state of the CoOEP molecule is characterized by a long lifetime and\nis dependent on the magnitude and duration of the applied field. Thus, after\napplying an external stimuli the system in the LS state after the spin\nswitching reverts to its ground state, whereas the system in the HS state\nremains in the excited state for a long time. We found that the temperature\ndependency of magnetic susceptibility shows an abrupt thermal spin transition\nbetween two spin states at 40K. The proposed here theoretical approach opens\nthe way to create modern devices for spintronics with the controllable spin\nswitching process.\n", "  We study the motion of pedestrians through an obscure tunnel where the lack\nof visibility hides the exits. Using a lattice model, we explore the effects of\ncommunication on the effective transport properties of the crowd of\npedestrians. More precisely, we study the effect of two thresholds on the\nstructure of the effective nonlinear diffusion coefficient. One threshold\nmodels pedestrians's communication efficiency in the dark, while the other one\ndescribes the tunnel capacity. Essentially, we note that if the evacuees show a\nmaximum trust (leading to a fast communication), they tend to quickly find the\nexit and hence the collective action tends to prevent the occurrence of\ndisasters.\n", "  Rescaled Mellin-type transforms of the exponential functional of the\nBourgade-Kuan-Rodgers statistic of Riemann zeroes are conjecturally related to\nthe distribution of the total mass of the limit lognormal stochastic measure of\nMandelbrot-Bacry-Muzy. The conjecture implies that a non-trivial,\nlog-infinitely divisible probability distribution is associated with Riemann\nzeroes. For application, integral moments, covariance structure, multiscaling\nspectrum, and asymptotics associated with the exponential functional are\ncomputed in closed form using the known meromorphic extension of the Selberg\nintegral.\n", "  We propose a unified framework that reconciles the stunning success of MOND\non galactic scales with the triumph of the LambdaCDM model on cosmological\nscales. This is achieved through the physics of superfluidity. Dark matter\nconsists of self-interacting axion-like particles that thermalize and condense\nto form a superfluid in galaxies, with ~mK critical temperature. The superfluid\nphonons mediate a MOND acceleration on baryonic matter. Our framework naturally\ndistinguishes between galaxies (where MOND is successful) and galaxy clusters\n(where MOND is not): dark matter has a higher temperature in clusters, and\nhence is in a mixture of superfluid and normal phase. The rich and well-studied\nphysics of superfluidity leads to a number of striking observational\nsignatures.\n", "  In the quest for quantum spin liquids in three spatial dimensions (3D), we\nstudy the half-filled Hubbard model on the simple cubic lattice with hopping\nprocesses up to third neighbors. Employing the variational cluster approach\n(VCA), we determine the zero-temperature phase diagram: In addition to a\nparamagnetic metal at small interaction strength $U$ and various\nantiferromagnetic insulators at large $U$, we find an intermediate-$U$\nantiferromagnetic metal. Most interestingly, we also identify a non-magnetic\ninsulating region, extending from intermediate to strong $U$. Using VCA results\nin the large-$U$ limit, we establish the phase diagram of the corresponding\n$J_1$-$J_2$-$J_3$ Heisenberg model. This is qualitatively confirmed - including\nthe non-magnetic region - using spin-wave theory. Further analysis reveals a\nstriking similarity to the behavior of the $J_1$-$J_2$ square-lattice\nHeisenberg model, suggesting that the non-magnetic region hosts a 3D\nspin-liquid phase.\n", "  We construct contact interactions for bosonic and fermionic point particles.\nWe first relate the resulting theories to classical electrostatics by taking\nfunctional averages over worldlines whose endpoints are fixed to charged\nparticles. Counting those paths which pass through a space-time point $x^{\\mu}$\ngives the static electric field at that point, provided we take the limit where\nthe length measured along the worldlines is large. We also investigate\ncorrections to the classical field that arise beyond leading order in this\nlimit before constructing a theory of point particles that interact when their\nworldlines intersect. We quantise this theory and show that the partition\nfunction contains propagator couplings between the endpoints of the particles\nbefore discussing how this is related to the worldline formalism of quantum\nfield theory and general action at a distance theories.\n", "  A preliminary determination of the Dirac phase in the PMNS matrix is\n$\\dell\\approx -\\frac{\\pi}{2}$. A rather accurately determined Jarlskog\ninvariant $J$ in the CKM matrix is close to the maximum. Since the phases in\nthe CKM and PMNS matrices will be accurately determined in the future, it is an\ninteresting problem to relate these two phases. This can be achieved in a\nfamilies-unified grand unification if the weak CP violation is introduced\nspontaneously {\\it \\`a la} Froggatt and Nielsen at a high energy scale, where\nonly one meaningful Dirac CP phase appears.\n", "  We present a series of hydrodynamic simulations of isolated galaxies with\nstellar mass of $10^{9} \\, \\rm{M}_{\\odot}$. The models use a resolution of $750\n\\, \\rm{M}_{\\odot}$ per particle and include a treatment for the full\nnon-equilibrium chemical evolution of ions and molecules (157 species in\ntotal), along with gas cooling rates computed self-consistently using the\nnon-equilibrium abundances. We compare these to simulations evolved using\ncooling rates calculated assuming chemical (including ionisation) equilibrium,\nand we consider a wide range of metallicities and UV radiation fields,\nincluding a local prescription for self-shielding by gas and dust. We find\nhigher star formation rates and stronger outflows at higher metallicity and for\nweaker radiation fields, as gas can more easily cool to a cold (few hundred\nKelvin) star forming phase under such conditions. Contrary to variations in the\nmetallicity and the radiation field, non-equilibrium chemistry generally has no\nstrong effect on the total star formation rates or outflow properties. However,\nit is important for modelling molecular outflows. For example, the mass of\nH$_{2}$ outflowing with velocities $> 50 \\, \\rm{km} \\, \\rm{s}^{-1}$ is enhanced\nby a factor $\\sim 20$ in non-equilibrium. We also compute the observable line\nemission from CII and CO. Both are stronger at higher metallicity, while CII\nand CO emission are higher for stronger and weaker radiation fields\nrespectively. We find that CII is generally unaffected by non-equilibrium\nchemistry. However, emission from CO varies by a factor of $\\sim 2 - 4$. This\nhas implications for the mean $X_{\\rm{CO}}$ conversion factor between CO\nemission and H$_{2}$ column density, which we find is lowered by up to a factor\n$\\sim 2.3$ in non-equilibrium, and for the fraction of CO-dark molecular gas.\n", "  In the present work, we consider the self-focusing discrete nonlinear\nSchr\u007fodinger equation on hexagonal and honeycomb lattice geometries. Our\nemphasis is on the study of the effects of anisotropy, motivated by the\ntunability afforded in recent optical and atomic physics experiments. We find\nthat important classes of solutions, such as the so-called discrete vortices,\nundergo destabilizing bifurcations as the relevant anisotropy control parameter\nis varied. We quantify these bifurcations by means of explicit analytical\ncalculations of the solutions, as well as of their spectral linearization\neigenvalues. Finally, we corroborate the relevant stability picture through\ndirect numerical computations. In the latter, we observe the prototypical\nmanifestation of these instabilities to be the spontaneous rearrangement of the\nsolution, for larger values of the coupling, into localized waveforms typically\ncentered over fewer sites than the original unstable structure. For weak\ncoupling, the instability appears to result in a robust breathing of the\nrelevant waveforms.\n", "  A thorough analysis of the evolutions of bipartite systems characterized by\nthe \\lq effective absence\\rq\\, of interaction between the two subsystems is\nreported. First, the connection between the concepts underlying\nInteraction-Free Evolutions (IFE) and Decoherence-Free Subspaces (DFS) is\nexplored, showing intricate relations between these concepts. Second, starting\nfrom this analysis and inspired by a generalization of DFS already known in the\nliterature, we introduce the notion of generalized IFE (GIFE), also providing a\nuseful characterization that allows to develop a general scheme for finding\nGIFE states.\n", "  In this paper, a modified Eddington-inspired-Born-Infeld (EiBI) theory with a\npure trace term $g_{\\mu\\nu}R$ being added to the determinantal action is\nanalysed from a cosmological point of view. It corresponds to the most general\naction constructed from a rank two tensor that contains up to first order terms\nin curvature. This term can equally be seen as a conformal factor multiplying\nthe metric $g_{\\mu\\nu}$. This very interesting type of amendment has not been\nconsidered within the Palatini formalism despite the large amount of works on\nthe Born-Infeld-inspired theory of gravity. This model can provide smooth\nbouncing solutions which were not allowed in the EiBI model for the same EiBI\ncoupling. Most interestingly, for a radiation filled universe there are some\nregions of the parameter space that can naturally lead to a de Sitter\ninflationary stage without the need of any exotic matter field. Finally, in\nthis model we discover a new type of cosmic \"quasi-sudden\" singularity, where\nthe cosmic time derivative of the Hubble rate becomes very large but finite at\na finite cosmic time.\n", "  We review the physics of magnetic quantum oscillations in quasi-one\ndimensional conductors with an open Fermi surface, in the presence of modulated\norder. We emphasize the difference between situations where a modulation\ncouples states on the same side of the Fermi surface and a modulation couples\nstates on opposite sides of the Fermi surface. We also consider cases where\nseveral modulations coexist, which may lead to a complex reorganization of the\nFermi surface. The interplay between nesting effects and magnetic breakdown is\ndiscussed. The experimental situation is reviewed.\n", "  An advection--diffusion-limited dissolution model of an object being eroded\nby a two-dimensional potential flow is presented. By taking advantage of the\nconformal invariance of the model, a numerical method is introduced that tracks\nthe evolution of the object boundary in terms of a time-dependent Laurent\nseries. Simulations of a variety of dissolving objects are shown, which shrink\nand then collapse to a single point in finite time. The simulations reveal a\nsurprising exact relationship whereby the collapse point is the root of a\nnon-analytic function given in terms of the flow velocity and the Laurent\nseries coefficients describing the initial shape. This result is subsequently\nderived using residue calculus. The structure of the non-analytic function is\nexamined for three different test cases, and a practical approach to determine\nthe collapse point using a generalized Newton--Raphson root-finding algorithm\nis outlined. These examples also illustrate the possibility that the model\nbreaks down in finite time prior to complete collapse, due to a topological\nsingularity, as the dissolving boundary overlaps itself rather than breaking up\ninto multiple domains (analogous to droplet pinch-off in fluid mechanics). In\nsummary, the model raises fundamental mathematical questions about broken\nsymmetries in finite-time singularities of both continuous and stochastic\ndynamical systems.\n", "  An electro-mechanical setup for the measurement of AC-forces in a\nlow-temperature tunnelling microscope has been developed, which enables\nextremely high force resolution. The crosstalk of vibrations onto the\ntunnelling current is used to measure the deflection of a force-sensing\ncantilever beam. We demonstrate its capability to measure the noise of the\nforce at a tunnelling contact using polycrystalline Iridium. Depending on\ntemperature, spring constant and current, a resolution in the range of $\\rm\n{fN}/\\sqrt{\\rm Hz}$ is possible. We observe peak levels of the force-noise at\nthe energy of the expected phonon maximal density of states, which suggests\nthat inelastic transport processes contribute to force fluctuations.\n", "  We investigate the spectral dimension obtained from non-local continuum\nd'Alembertians derived from causal sets. We find a universal dimensional\nreduction to 2 dimensions, in all dimensions. We conclude by discussing the\nvalidity and relevance of our results within the broader context of quantum\nfield theories based on these nonlocal dynamics.\n", "  We show that the particle-number distribution of diamond modes, modes that\nare localized in a finite space-time region, are thermal for the Minkowski\nvacuum state of a massless scalar field, an analogue to the Unruh effect. The\ntemperature of the diamond is inversely proportional to its size. An inertial\nobserver can detect this thermal radiation by coupling to the diamond modes\nusing an appropriate energy-scaled detector. We further investigate the\ncorrelations between various diamonds and find that entanglement between\nadjacent diamonds dominates.\n", "  We theoretically investigate how the threshold of a Ge-on-Si laser can be\nminimized and how the slope efficiency can be maximized in presence of both\nbiaxial tensile strain and n-type doping. Our finding shows that there exist\nultimate limits beyond which point no further benefit can be realized through\nincreased tensile strain or n-type doping. Here were quantify these limits,\nshowing that the optimal design for minimizing threshold involves about 3.7%\nbiaxial tensile strain and 2x1018 cm-3 n-type doping, whereas the optimal\ndesign for maximum slope efficiency involves about 2.3% biaxial tensile strain\nwith 1x1019 cm-3 n-type doping. Increasing the strain and/or doping beyond\nthese limits will degrade the threshold or slope efficiency, respectively.\n", "  Using the cosmological smoothed particle hydrodynamical code GADGET-3 we make\na realistic assessment of the technique of using constant cumulative number\ndensity as a tracer of galaxy evolution at high redshift. We find that over a\nredshift range of $3\\leq z \\leq7$ one can on average track the growth of the\nstellar mass of a population of galaxies selected from the same cumulative\nnumber density bin to within $\\sim 0.20$ dex. Over the stellar mass range we\nprobe ($10^{10.39}\\leq M_s/M_\\odot \\leq 10^{10.75}$ at $z =$ 3 and\n$10^{8.48}\\leq M_s/M_\\odot \\leq 10^{9.55}$ at $z =$ 7) one can reduce this bias\nby selecting galaxies based on an evolving cumulative number density. We find\nthe cumulative number density evolution exhibits a trend towards higher values\nwhich can be quantified by simple linear formulations going as $-0.10\\Delta z$\nfor descendants and $0.12\\Delta z$ for progenitors. Utilizing such an evolving\ncumulative number density increases the accuracy of descendant/progenitor\ntracking by a factor of $\\sim2$. This result is in excellent agreement, within\n$0.10$ dex, with abundance matching results over the same redshift range.\nHowever, we find that our more realistic cosmological hydrodynamic simulations\nproduce a much larger scatter in descendant/progenitor stellar masses than\nprevious studies, particularly when tracking progenitors. This large scatter\nmakes the application of either the constant cumulative number density or\nevolving cumulative number density technique limited to average stellar masses\nof populations only, as the diverse mass assembly histories caused by\nstochastic physical processes such as gas accretion, mergers, and star\nformation of individual galaxies will lead to a larger scatter in other\nphysical properties such as metallicity and star-formation rate.\n", "  We investigate non-equilibrium fluctuations of a solid surface governed by\nthe stochastic Mullins-Herring equation with conserved noise. This equation\ndescribes surface diffusion of adatoms accompanied by their exchange between\nthe surface and the bulk of the solid, when desorption of adatoms is\nnegligible. Previous works dealt with dynamic scaling behavior of the\nfluctuating interface. Here we determine the probability that the interface\nfirst reaches a large given height at a specified time. We also find the\noptimal time history of the interface conditional on this non-equilibrium\nfluctuation. We obtain these results by developing a macroscopic fluctuation\ntheory of surface diffusion.\n", "  Our analysis of archival VLBI data of PSR 0834+06 revealed that its\nscintillation properties can be precisely modelled using the inclined sheet\nmodel (Pen & Levin 2014), resulting in two distinct lens planes. These data\nstrongly favour the grazing sheet model over turbulence as the primary source\nof pulsar scattering. This model can reproduce the parameters of the observed\ndiffractive scintillation with an accuracy at the percent level. Comparison\nwith new VLBI proper motion results in a direct measure of the ionized ISM\nscreen transverse velocity. The results are consistent with ISM velocities\nlocal to the PSR 0834+06 sight-line (through the Galaxy). The simple 1D\nstructure of the lenses opens up the possibility of using interstellar lenses\nas precision probes for pulsar lens mapping, precision transverse motions in\nthe ISM, and new opportunities for removing scattering to improve pulsar\ntiming. We describe the parameters and observables of this double screen\nsystem. While relative screen distances can in principle be accurately\ndetermined, a global conformal distance degeneracy exists that allows a\nrescaling of the absolute distance scale. For PSR B0834+06, we present VLBI\nastrometry results that provide (for the fist time) a direct measurement of the\ndistance of the pulsar. For targets where independent distance measurements are\nnot available, which are the cases for most of the recycled millisecond pulsars\nthat are the targets of precision timing observations, the degeneracy presented\nin the lens modelling could be broken if the pulsar resides in a binary system.\n", "  Polarization induced degenerate $n$-type doping with electron concentrations\nup to $\\sim$10$^{20}$\\,cm$^{-3}$ is achieved in graded Al$_{x}$Ga$_{1-x}$N\nlayers ($x$: 0\\%$\\rightarrow$37\\%) grown on unintentionally doped and on\n$n$-doped GaN:Si buffer/reservoir layers by metal organic vapor phase epitaxy.\nHigh resolution x-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy and\nelectron energy loss spectroscopy confirm the gradient in the composition of\nthe Al$_{x}$Ga$_{1-x}$N layers, while magnetotransport studies reveal the\nformation of a three dimensional electron slab, whose conductivity can be\nadjusted through the GaN(:Si) buffer/reservoir.\n", "  The Fisher Information matrix is a widely used measure for applications\nranging from statistical inference, information geometry, experiment design, to\nthe study of criticality in biological systems. Yet there is no commonly\naccepted non-parametric algorithm to estimate it from real data. In this rapid\ncommunication we show how to accurately estimate the Fisher information in a\nnonparametric way. We also develop a numerical procedure to minimize the errors\nby choosing the interval of the finite difference scheme necessary to compute\nthe derivatives in the definition of the Fisher information. Our method uses\nthe recently published \"Density Estimation using Field Theory\" algorithm to\ncompute the probability density functions for continuous densities. We use the\nFisher information of the normal distribution to validate our method and as an\nexample we compute the temperature component of the Fisher Information Matrix\nin the two dimensional Ising model and show that it obeys the expected relation\nto the heat capacity and therefore peaks at the phase transition at the correct\ncritical temperature.\n", "  We define the worldline harmonic SU(2|1) superspace and its analytic subspace\nas a deformation of the flat N=4, d=1 harmonic superspace. The harmonic\nsuperfield description of the two mutually mirror off-shell (4,4,0) SU(2|1)\nsupermultiplets is developed and the corresponding invariant actions are\npresented, as well as the relevant classical and quantum supercharges. Whereas\nthe \\sigma-model actions exist for both types of the (4,4,0) multiplet, the\ninvariant Wess-Zumino term can be defined only for one of them, thus\ndemonstrating non-equivalence of these multiplets in the SU(2|1) case as\nopposed to the flat N=4, d=1 supersymmetry. A superconformal subclass of\ngeneral SU(2|1) actions invariant under the trigonometric-type realizations of\nthe supergroup D(2,1;\\alpha) is singled out. The superconformal Wess-Zumino\nactions possess an infinite-dimensional supersymmetry forming the centerless\nN=4 super Virasoro algebra. We solve a few simple instructive examples of the\nSU(2|1) supersymmetric quantum mechanics of the (4,4,0) multiplets and reveal\nthe SU(2|1) representation contents of the corresponding sets of the quantum\nstates.\n", "  We revisit necessary conditions for gluing local (anti-)D3 throats into flux\nthroats with opposite charge. These consistency conditions typically reveal\nsingularities in the three-form fluxes whose meaning is being debated. In this\nnote we prove, under well-motivated assumptions, that unphysical singularities\ncan potentially be avoided when the anti-branes polarise into spherical NS5\nbranes with a specific radius. If a consistent solution can then indeed be\nfound, our analysis seems to suggests a rather large correction to the radius\nof the polarization sphere compared to the probe result. We furthermore comment\non the gluing conditions at finite temperature and point out that one specific\nassumption of a recent no-go theorem can be broken if anti-branes are indeed to\npolarise into spherical NS5 branes at zero temperature.\n", "  Context. Observations of the effect of microlensing in gravitationally lensed\nquasars could potentially be used to study the structure of the source on\ndistance scales down to the size of the supermassive black hole powering the\nquasar activity.\n  Aims. We search for the microlensing effect in the gamma-ray band using the\nsignal from a gravitationally lensed blazar B0218+357.\n  Methonds. We develop a method of deconvolution of contributions of two images\nof the source into the gamma-ray band flaring lightcurve. We use this method to\nstudy the evolution of the magnification factor ratio between the two images\nthroughout the flaring episodes. We interpret the time variability of the ratio\nas a signature of the microlensing effect and derive constraints on the\nphysical parameters of the gamma-ray source by comparing the observed\nvariability properties of the magnification factor ratio with those derived\nfrom numerical simulations of the microlensing caustics networks.\n  Results. We find that the magnification factor ratio has experienced a change\ncharacteristic for a microlensing caustic crossing event during a 100 d flaring\nperiod in 2012. It has further changed between 2012 and a recent flaring\nepisode in 2014. We use the measurement of the maximal magnification and\nduration of the caustic crossing event to derive an estimate of the projected\nsize of the gamma-ray emission region in B0218+357, $R_\\gamma \\sim 10^{14}$ cm.\nThis estimate is compatible with a complementary estimate found from the\nminimal variability time scale. The microlensing / minimal variability time\nscale measurements of the source size suggest that the gamma-ray emission is\nproduced at the base of the blazar jet, in the direct vicinity of the central\nsupermassive black hole.\n", "  We present a graph-theoretic model of consumer choice, where final decisions\nare shown to be influenced by information and knowledge, in the form of\nindividual awareness, discriminating ability, and perception of market\nstructure. Building upon the distance-based Hotelling's differentiation idea,\nwe describe the behavioral experience of several prototypes of consumers, who\nwalk a hypothetical cognitive path in an attempt to maximize their\nsatisfaction. Our simulations show that even consumers endowed with a small\namount of information and knowledge may reach a very high level of utility. On\nthe other hand, complete ignorance negatively affects the whole consumption\nprocess. In addition, rather unexpectedly, a random walk on the graph reveals\nto be a winning strategy, below a minimal threshold of information and\nknowledge.\n", "  We present a single-molecule tool called the CoPro (Concentration of\nProteins) method that uses millisecond imaging with convolution analysis,\nautomated image segmentation and super-resolution localization microscopy to\ngenerate robust estimates for protein concentration in different compartments\nof single living cells, validated using realistic simulations of complex\nmultiple compartment cell types. We demonstrates its utility experimentally on\nmodel Escherichia coli bacteria and Saccharomyces cerevisiae budding yeast\ncells, and use it to address the biological question of how signals are\ntransduced in cells. Cells in all domains of life dynamically sense their\nenvironment through signal transduction mechanisms, many involving gene\nregulation. The glucose sensing mechanism of S. cerevisiae is a model system\nfor studying gene regulatory signal transduction. It uses the multi-copy\nexpression inhibitor of the GAL gene family, Mig1, to repress unwanted genes in\nthe presence of elevated extracellular glucose concentrations. We fluorescently\nlabelled Mig1 molecules with green fluorescent protein (GFP) via chromosomal\nintegration at physiological expression levels in living S. cerevisiae cells,\nin addition to the RNA polymerase protein Nrd1 with the fluorescent protein\nreporter mCherry. Using CoPro we make quantitative estimates of Mig1 and Nrd1\nprotein concentrations in the cytoplasm and nucleus compartments on a\ncell-by-cell basis under physiological conditions. These estimates indicate a\n4-fold shift towards higher values in concentration of diffusive Mig1 in the\nnucleus if the external glucose concentration is raised, whereas equivalent\nlevels in the cytoplasm shift to smaller values with a relative change an order\nof magnitude smaller. This compares with Nrd1 which is not involved directly in\nglucose sensing, which is almost exclusively localized in the nucleus under\nhigh and...\n", "  We introduce a new image cytometer design for detection of very small\nparticulate and demonstrate its capability in water analysis. The device is a\ncompact microscope composed of off the shelf components, such as a light\nemitting diode (LED) source, a complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS)\nimage sensor, and a specific combination of optical lenses that allow, through\nan appropriate software, Fourier transform processing of the sample volume.\nWaterborne microorganisms, such as Escherichia coli (E. coli), Legionella\npneumophila (L. pneumophila) and Phytoplankton, are detected by interrogating\nthe volume sample either in a fluorescent or label-free mode, i.e. with or\nwithout fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) molecules attached to the\nmicro-organisms, respectively. We achieve a sensitivity of 50 cells/ml, which\ncan be further increased to 0.2 cells/ml by preconcentrating an initial sample\nvolume of 500 ml with an adhoc fluidic system. We also prove the capability of\nthe proposed image cytometer of differentiating microbiological populations by\nsize with a resolution of 3 um and of operating in real contaminated water.\n", "  Motivated by ATLAS diboson excess around 2 TeV, we investigate a\nphenomenology of spin-1 resonances in a model where electroweak sector in the\nSM is weakly coupled to strong dynamics. The spin-1 resonances, W' and Z', are\nintroduced as effective degrees of freedom of the dynamical sector. We explore\nseveral theoretical constraints by investigating the scalar potential of the\nmodel as well as the current bounds from the LHC and precision measurements. It\nis found that the main decay modes are V' -> VV and V' -> Vh, and the V' width\nis narrow enough so that the ATLAS diboson excess can be explained. In order to\ninvestigate future prospects, we also perform collider simulations at the 13\nTeV LHC, and obtain a model independent expected exclusion limit for the\nprocess pp -> W' -> WZ -> JJ. We find a parameter space where the diboson\nexcess can be explained, and are within a reach of the LHC at the integrated\nluminosity of 10 fb-1 and 13 TeV.\n", "  We consider two systems of wave equations whose wave-packet solutions have\ntrajectories that are altered by the \"anomalous velocity\" effect of a Berry\ncurvature. The first is the matrix Weyl equation describing cyclotron motion of\na charged massless fermion. The second is Maxwell equations for the\nwhispering-gallery modes of light in a cylindrical waveguide. In the case of\nthe massless fermion, the anomalous velocity is obscured by the contribution\nfrom the magnetic moment. In the whispering gallery modes the anomalous\nvelocity causes the circumferential light ray to creep up the cylinder at the\nrate of one wavelength per orbit, and can be identified as a continuous version\nof the Imbert-Federov effect.\n", "  Zonal and meridional axisymmetric flows can deeply impact the rotational and\nchemical evolution of stars. Therefore, momentum exchanges between waves\npropagating in stars, differential rotation, and meridional circulation must be\ncarefully evaluated. In this work, we study axisymmetric mean flows in rapidly\nand initially uniformly rotating massive stars driven by small amplitude\nnon-axisymmetric $\\kappa$-driven oscillations. We treat them as perturbations\nof second-order of the oscillation amplitudes and derive their governing\nequations as a set of coupled linear ordinary differential equations. This\nallows us to compute 2-D zonal and meridional mean flows driven by low\nfrequency $g$- and $r$-modes in slowly pulsating B (SPB) stars and $p$-modes in\n$\\beta$ Cephei stars. Oscillation-driven mean flows usually have large\namplitudes only in the surface layers. In addition, the kinetic energy of the\ninduced 2-D zonal rotational motions is much larger than that of the meridional\nmotions. In some cases, meridional flows have a complex radial and latitudinal\nstructure. For SPB stars, we find that there are low frequency retrograde\n$g$-modes and $r$-modes that drive mean flows with positive velocity components\nin the radial and azimuthal directions at the stellar surface. This suggests\nthat low frequency retrograde modes can transport angular momentum to the\nsurface layers, which may help to form a circumstellar gaseous disc. Moreover,\npulsation-driven and rotation-driven meridional flows can have similar\namplitudes. These results show the importance of taking wave-- mean flow\ninteractions into account when studying the evolution of massive stars.\n", "  Webs are sets of Feynman diagrams that contribute to the exponents of\nscattering amplitudes, in the kinematic limit in which emitted radiation is\nsoft. As such, they have a number of phenomenological and formal applications,\nand offer tantalising glimpses into the all-order structure of perturbative\nquantum field theory. This article is based on a series of lectures given to\ngraduate students, and aims to provide a pedagogical introduction to webs.\nTopics covered include exponentiation in (non-)abelian gauge theories, the web\nmixing matrix formalism for non-abelian gauge theories, and recent progress on\nthe calculation of web diagrams. Problems are included throughout the text, to\naid understanding.\n", "  We study the effect of the intrinsic (Rashba or Dresselhaus) spin-orbit\ninteraction in superconductor--nanowire--superconductor (SNS) weak links in the\npresence of a spin-splitting field that can result either from an intrinsic\nexchange field or the Zeeman effect of an applied field. We solve the full\nnon-linear Usadel equations numerically and analyze the resulting supercurrent\nthrough the weak link and the behavior of the density of states in the center\nof the wire. We point out how the presence of the spin-orbit interaction gives\nrise to a long-range spin triplet supercurrent, which remains finite even in\nthe limit of very large exchange fields. In particular, we show how rotating\nthe field leads to a sequence of transitions between the 0 and $\\pi$ states as\na function of the angle between the exchange field and the spin-orbit field.\nSimultaneously, the triplet pairing leads to a zero-energy peak in the density\nof states. We proceed by solving the linearized Usadel equations, showing the\ncorrespondence to the solutions of the full equations and detail the emergence\nof the long-range supercurrent components. Our studies are relevant for\non-going investigations of supercurrent in semiconductor nanowires in the limit\nof several channels and in the presence of disorder.\n", "  We study the existence of chimera states in pulse-coupled networks of\nbursting Hindmarsh-Rose neurons with nonlocal, global and local (nearest\nneighbor) couplings. Through a linear stability analysis, we discuss the\nbehavior of stability function in the incoherent (i.e. disorder), coherent,\nchimera and multi-chimera states. Surprisingly, we find that chimera and\nmulti-chimera states occur even using local nearest neighbor interaction in a\nnetwork of identical bursting neurons alone. This is in contrast with the\nexistence of chimera states in populations of nonlocally or globally coupled\noscillators. A chemical synaptic coupling function is used which plays a key\nrole in the emergence of chimera states in bursting neurons. Existence of\nchimera, multi-chimera, coherent and disordered states are confirmed by means\nof the recently introduced statistical measures and mean phase velocity.\n", "  We address the issue of identifying the mediators of effective interactions\nin cuprates superconductors. Specifically, we use inversion theory to analyze\nRaman spectra of optimally and over-doped La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ samples. This\nallows us to extract the so-called glue function without making any a priori\nassumption based on any specific model. We use instead two different\ntechniques, namely the singular value decomposition and a multi-rectangle\ndecomposition. With both techniques we find consistent results showing that: i)\ntwo distinct excitations are responsible for the glue function, which have\ncompletely different doping dependence. One excitation becomes weak above\noptimal doping, where on the contrary the other keeps (or even slightly\nincreases) its strength; ii) there is a marked temperature dependence on the\nweight and spectral distribution of these excitation, which therefore must have\na somewhat critical character. It is quite natural to identify and characterize\nthese two distinct excitations as damped antiferromagnetic spin waves and\ndamped charge density waves, respectively. This sets the stage for a scenario\nin which superconductivity is concomitant and competing with a charge ordering\ninstability.\n", "  Experiments measuring contact formation between a probe and quencher in\ndisordered chains provide information on the fundamental dynamical timescales\nrelevant to protein folding, but their interpretation usually relies on\nsimplified one-dimensional (1D) diffusion models. Here, we use all-atom\nmolecular simulations to capture both the time-scales of contact formation, as\nwell as the scaling with the length of the peptide for tryptophan triplet\nquenching experiments. Capturing the experimental quenching times depends on\nthe water viscosity, but more importantly on the configurational space explored\nby the chain. We also show that very similar results are obtained from\nSzabo-Schulten-Schulten theory applied to a 1D diffusion model derived from the\nsimulations, supporting the validity of such models. However, we also find a\nsignificant reduction in diffusivity at small separations, those which are most\nimportant in determining the quenching rate.\n", "  We have used a combination of numerical modeling and experiments to study\ncarbon etching in the presence of a hydrogen plasma. We model the evolution of\na low density EUV-induced plasma during and after the EUV pulse to obtain the\nenergy resolved ion fluxes from the plasma to the surface. By relating the\ncomputed ion fluxes to the experimentally observed etching rate at various\npressures and ion energies, we show that at low pressure and energy, carbon\netching is due to chemical sputtering, while at high pressure and energy a\nreactive ion etching process is likely to dominate.\n", "  Using the theory of elasticity of polymer gels we show that large-scale\ncross-link density patterns written into the structure of the network in the\nmelt state, can be revealed upon swelling by monitoring the monomer density\npatterns. We find that while isotropic deformations in good solvent yield\nmagnified images of the original pattern, anisotropic deformations distort the\nimage (both types of deformation yield affinely stretched images in $\\theta$\nsolvents). We show that in ordinary solids with spatially inhomogeneous profile\nof the shear modulus, isotropic stretching leads to distorted density image of\nthis profile under isotropic deformation. Using simple physical arguments we\ndemonstrate that the different response to isotropic stretching stems from\nfundamental differences between the theory of elasticity of solids and that of\ngels. Possible tests of our predictions and some potential applications are\ndiscussed.\n", "  This work is devoted to the development of a novel theoretical approach,\nnamed hybrid approach, to handle a localized bottleneck in a symmetrically\ncoupled two-channel totally asymmetric simple exclusion process with Langmuir\nkinetics. The hybrid approach is combined with singular perturbation technique\nto get steady-state phase diagrams and density profiles. We have thoroughly\nexamined the role played by the strength of bottleneck, binding constant and\nlane-changing rate in the system dynamics. The appearances of\nbottleneck-induced shock, a bottleneck phase and Meissner phase are explained.\nFurther, the critical values of bottleneck rate are identified, which signify\nthe changes in the topology of phase diagram. It is also found that increase in\nlane-changing rate as well as unequal attachment, detachment rates weaken the\nbottleneck effect. Our theoretical arguments are in good agreement with\nextensively performed Monte Carlo simulations.\n", "  We define a generalization of scalar fields with non-canonical kinetic term\nwhich we call exotic k-essence or briefly, exotik. These fields are generated\nby the global description of cosmological models with two interactive fluids in\nthe dark sector and under certain conditions, they correspond to usual\nk-essences. The formalism is applied to the cases of constant potential and of\ninverse square potential and also we develop the purely exotik version for the\nmodified holographic Ricci type of dark energy (MHR), where the equations of\nstate are not constant. With the kinetic function $F=1+mx$ and the inverse\nsquare potential we recover, through the interaction term, the identification\nbetween k-essences and quintessences of exponential potential, already known\nfor Friedmann-Robertson-Walker and Bianchi type I geometries. Worked examples\nare shown that include the self-interacting MHR and also models with crossing\nof the phantom divide line (PDL).\n", "  Contrary to the conventional empirical law, band gap of dilute nitride\nsemiconductors decreases with nitrogen concentration.\n  In spite of a number of investigations, origin of this \"large band gap\nbowing\", is still under debate. In order to elucidate this phenomenon, we\ninvestigate change of band edge energies of GaN$_x$As$_{1-x}$ due to nitrogen\nby using the perturbation theory. It is found that energy shift of conduction\nband edge is arising from mixing between $\\Gamma$- and L-states and/or\n$\\Gamma$- and X-states induced by displacement of Ga atoms around N. We also\nfound that the valence band edge state shows upward shift in spite of negative\npotential of nitrogen. These results are well understood from character of the\nwavefunctions and symmetry of the perturbation potential.\n", "  We studied the transport properties of electrons in graphene as they are\nscattered by a double barrier potential in the presence of an inhomogeneous\nmagnetic field. We computed the transmission coefficient and Goos-H\\\"anchen\nlike shifts for our system and noticed that transmission is not allowed for\ncertain range of energies. In particular, we found that, in contrast to the\nelectrostatic barriers, the magnetic barriers are able to confine Dirac\nfermions. We also established some correlation between the electronic\ntransmission properties of Dirac fermions with the Goos-H\\\"anchen like shifts,\nas reflected in the numerical data.\n", "  Assuming that the time-evolution of the self-consistent mean field is\ndetermined by five pairs of collective coordinate and collective momentum, we\nmicroscopically derive the collective Hamiltonian for low-frequency quadrupole\nmodes of excitation. We show that the five-dimensional collective Schr\\\"odinger\nequation is capable of describing large-amplitude quadrupole shape dynamics\nseen as shape coexistence/mixing phenomena. We focus on basic ideas and recent\nadvances of the approaches based on the time-dependent mean-field theory, but\nrelations to other time-independent approaches are also briefly discussed.\n", "  During the last 70 years, the quantum theory of angular momentum has been\nsuccessfully applied to describing the properties of nuclei, atoms, and\nmolecules, their interactions with each other as well as with external fields.\nDue to the properties of quantum rotations, the angular momentum algebra can be\nof tremendous complexity even for a few interacting particles, such as valence\nelectrons of an atom, not to mention larger many-particle systems. In this\nwork, we study an example of the latter: a rotating quantum impurity coupled to\na many-body bosonic bath. In the regime of strong impurity-bath couplings the\nproblem involves addition of an infinite number of angular momenta which\nrenders it intractable using currently available techniques. Here, we introduce\na novel canonical transformation which allows to eliminate the complex angular\nmomentum algebra from such a class of many-body problems. In addition, the\ntransformation exposes the problem's constants of motion, and renders it\nsolvable exactly in the limit of a slowly-rotating impurity. We exemplify the\ntechnique by showing that there exists a critical rotational speed at which the\nimpurity suddenly acquires one quantum of angular momentum from the\nmany-particle bath. Such an instability is accompanied by the deformation of\nthe phonon density in the frame rotating along with the impurity.\n", "  Contagion, a concept from epidemiology, has long been used to characterize\nsocial influence on people's behavior and affective (emotional) states. While\nit has revealed many useful insights, it is not clear whether the contagion\nmetaphor is sufficient to fully characterize the complex dynamics of\npsychological states in a social context. Using wearable sensors that capture\ndaily face-to-face interaction, combined with three daily experience sampling\nsurveys, we collected the most comprehensive data set of personality and\nemotion dynamics of an entire community of work. From this high-resolution data\nabout actual (rather than self-reported) face-to-face interaction, a complex\npicture emerges where contagion (that can be seen as adaptation of behavioral\nresponses to the behavior of other people) cannot fully capture the dynamics of\ntransitory states. We found that social influence has two opposing effects on\nstates: \\emph{adaptation} effects that go beyond mere contagion, and\n\\emph{complementarity} effects whereby individuals' behaviors tend to\ncomplement the behaviors of others. Surprisingly, these effects can exhibit\ncompletely different directions depending on the stable personality or\nemotional dispositions (stable traits) of target individuals. Our findings\nprovide a foundation for richer models of social dynamics, and have\nimplications on organizational engineering and workplace well-being.\n", "  Measurements of the galaxy power spectrum contain a wealth of information\nabout the Universe. Its optimal extraction is vital if we are to truly\nunderstand the micro-physical nature of dark matter and dark energy. In Smith &\nMarian (2015) we generalized the power spectrum methodology of Feldman et al.\n(1994) to take into account the key tenets of galaxy formation: galaxies form\nand reside exclusively in dark matter haloes; a given dark matter halo may host\ngalaxies of various luminosities; galaxies inherit the large-scale bias\nassociated with their host halo. In this paradigm we derived the optimal\nweighting and reconstruction scheme for maximizing the signal-to-noise on a\ngiven band power estimate. For a future all-sky flux-limited galaxy redshift\nsurvey of depth b_J ~22, we now demonstrate that the optimal weighting scheme\ndoes indeed provide improved S/N at the level of ~20% when compared to Feldman\net al. (1994) and ~60% relative to Percival et al. (2003), for scales of order\nk~0.5 Mpc/h. Using a Fisher matrix approach, we show that the cosmological\ninformation yield is also increased relative to these alternate methods --\nespecially the primordial power spectrum amplitude and dark energy equation of\nstate.\n", "  We study an ${\\cal N} = 2$ supersymmetric generalization of the\nthree-dimensional critical $O(N)$ vector model that is described by $N+1$\nchiral superfields with superpotential $W = g_1 X \\sum_i Z_i^2 + g_2 X^3$. By\ncombining the tools of the conformal bootstrap with results obtained through\nsupersymmetric localization, we argue that this model exhibits a symmetry\nenhancement at the infrared superconformal fixed point due to $g_2$ flowing to\nzero. This example is special in that the existence of an infrared fixed point\nwith $g_1,g_2\\neq 0$, which does not exhibit symmetry enhancement, does not\ngenerally lead to any obvious unitarity violations or other inconsistencies. We\ndo show, however, that the $F$-theorem excludes the models with $g_1,g_2\\neq 0$\nfor $N>5$. The conformal bootstrap provides a stronger constraint and excludes\nsuch models for $N>2$. We provide evidence that the $g_2=0$ models, which have\nthe enhanced $O(N)\\times U(1)$ symmetry, come close to saturating the bootstrap\nbounds. We extend our analysis to fractional dimensions where we can motivate\nthe nonexistence of the $g_1,g_2\\neq 0$ models by studying them perturbatively\nin the $4-\\epsilon$ expansion.\n", "  We study a class of orientifold compactifications of type IIB supergravity\nwith fluxes down to 4D in connection with truncations of half-maximal gauged\nsupergravities yielding isotropic STU-models with minimal supersymmetry. In\nthis context, we make use of a group-theoretical approach in order to derive\nflux-induced superpotentials for different IIB backgrounds. We first review the\ntoroidal case yielding GKP-like superpotentials characterised by their\n\\emph{no-scale} behaviour. We then turn to $S^{3} \\times S^{3}$ and $S^{3}\n\\times \\mathbb{T}^{3}$, which, surprisingly, give rise to effective\ndescriptions of non-geometric $Q$- and $P$-fluxes through globally geometric\nnon-toroidal compactifications. As a consequence, such constructions break the\nno-scale symmetry without invoking any non-perturbative effects.\n", "  We investigate the interplay of diffraction and nonlinear effects during\npropagation of very short light pulses. Adapting the factorization approach to\nthe problem at hand by keeping the transverse-derivative terms apart from the\nresidual nonlinear contributions we derive an unidirectional propagation\nequation valid for weak dispersion and reducing to the\nslowly-evolving-wave-approximation for the case of paraxial rays. Comparison of\nnumerical simulation results for the two equations shows pronounced differences\nwhen self-focusing plays important role. We devote special attention to\nmodelling propagation of ultrashort terahertz pulses taking into account\ndiffraction as well as Kerr type and second order nonlinearities. Comparing\nmeasured and simulated wave forms we deduce the value of the nonlinear\nrefractive index of lithium niobate in the terahertz region to be three orders\nof magnitude larger than in the visible.\n", "  Recently, the STAR collaboration at RHIC has presented experimental evidence\nfor the correlation between the elliptic flow difference of charged pions and\ncharge asymmetry as a possible signal of the chiral magnetic wave. We\ndemonstrate that the STAR results can be understood within the standard viscous\nhydrodynamics.\n", "  Interplay of spin, charge, orbital and lattice degrees of freedom in oxide\nheterostructures results in a plethora of fascinating properties, which can be\nexploited in new generations of electronic devices with enhanced\nfunctionalities. The paradigm example is the interface between the two band\ninsulators LaAlO3 and SrTiO3 (LAO/STO) that hosts two-dimensional electron\nsystem (2DES). Apart from the mobile charge carriers, this system exhibits a\nrange of intriguing properties such as field effect, superconductivity and\nferromagnetism, whose fundamental origins are still debated. Here, we use\nsoft-X-ray angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy to penetrate through the\nLAO overlayer and access charge carriers at the buried interface. The\nexperimental spectral function directly identifies the interface charge\ncarriers as large polarons, emerging from coupling of charge and lattice\ndegrees of freedom, and involving two phonons of different energy and thermal\nactivity. This phenomenon fundamentally limits the carrier mobility and\nexplains its puzzling drop at high temperatures.\n", "  We study the pairwise quantum discord (QD) for a symmetric multi-qubit system\nin different types of noisy channels, such as phase-flip, amplitude damping,\nphase-damping, and depolarizing channels. Using the QD and geometric measure of\nquantum discord (GMQD) to quantify quantum correlations, some analytical or\nnumerical results are presented. The results show that, the dynamics of the\npairwise QD is related to the number of spin particles $N$ as well as initial\nparameter $\\theta$ of the one-axis twisting collective state. With the number\nof spin particles $N$ increasing, the amount of the pairwise QD increases.\nHowever, when the amount of the pairwise QD arrives at a stable maximal value,\nthe pairwise QD is independence of the number of spin particles $N$ increasing.\nThe behavior of the pairwise QD is symmetrical during a period $0\\leq \\theta\n\\leq 2\\pi$. Moreover, we compare the pairwise QD dynamics with the GMQD for a\nsymmetric multi-qubit system in different types of noisy channels.\n", "  We present results on the nucleon scalar, axial and tensor charges as well as\non the momentum fraction, and the helicity and transversity moments. The pion\nmomentum fraction is also presented. The computation of these key observables\nis carried out using lattice QCD simulations at a physical value of the pion\nmass. The evaluation is based on gauge configurations generated with two\ndegenerate sea quarks of twisted mass fermions with a clover term. We\ninvestigate excited states contributions with the nucleon quantum numbers by\nanalyzing three sink-source time separations. We find that, for the scalar\ncharge, excited states contribute significantly and to a less degree to the\nnucleon momentum fraction and helicity moment. Our analysis yields a value for\nthe nucleon axial charge agrees with the experimental value and we predict a\nvalue of 1.027(62) in the $\\overline{\\text{MS}}$ scheme at 2 GeV for the\nisovector nucleon tensor charge directly at the physical point. The pion\nmomentum fraction is found to be $\\langle\nx\\rangle_{u-d}^{\\pi^\\pm}=0.214(15)(^{+12}_{-9})$ in the $\\overline{\\rm MS}$ at\n2 GeV.\n", "  By using observations of the Hulse-Taylor pulsar we constrain the\ngravitational wave (GW) speed to the level of $10^{-2}$. We apply this result\nto scalar-tensor theories that generalize Galileon 4 and 5 models, which\ndisplay anomalous propagation speed and coupling to matter for GWs. We argue\nthat this effect survives conventional screening due to the persistence of a\nscalar field gradient inside virialized overdensities, which effectively\n\"pierces\" the Vainshtein screening. In specific branches of solutions, our\nresult allows to directly constrain the cosmological couplings in the effective\nfield theory of dark energy formalism.\n", "  A multi-parametric version of the nonadditive entropy $S_{q}$ is introduced.\nThis new entropic form, denoted by $S_{a,b,r}$, possesses many interesting\nstatistical properties, and it reduces to the entropy $S_q$ for $b=0$,\n$a=r:=1-q$ (hence Boltzmann-Gibbs entropy $S_{BG}$ for $b=0$, $a=r \\to 0$). The\nconstruction of the entropy $S_{a,b,r}$ is based on a general group-theoretical\napproach recently proposed by one of us \\cite{Tempesta2}. Indeed, essentially\nall the properties of this new entropy are obtained as a consequence of the\nexistence of a rational group law, which expresses the structure of $S_{a,b,r}$\nwith respect to the composition of statistically independent subsystems.\nDepending on the choice of the parameters, the entropy $S_{a,b,r}$ can be used\nto cover a wide range of physical situations, in which the measure of the\naccessible phase space increases say exponentially with the number of particles\n$N$ of the system, or even stabilizes, by increasing $N$, to a limiting value.\nThis paves the way to the use of this entropy in contexts where a system\n\"freezes\" some or many of its degrees of freedom by increasing the number of\nits constituting particles or subsystems.\n", "  We consider nucleon-decay-like signatures of the hylogenesis, a variant of\nthe antibaryonic dark matter model. For the interaction between visible and\ndark matter sectors through the neutron portal, we calculate the rates of dark\nmatter scatterings off neutron which mimic neutron-decay processes $n\\to\n\\nu\\gamma$ and $n\\to \\nu e^+ e^-$ with richer kinematics. We obtain bounds on\nthe model parameters from nonobservation of the neutron decays by applying the\nkinematical cuts adopted in the experimental analyses. The bounds are generally\n(much) weaker than those coming from the recently performed study of events\nwith a single jet of high transverse momentum and missing energy observed at\nthe LHC. Then we suggest several new nucleon-decay like processes with two\nmesons in the final state and estimate (accounting for the LHC constraints) the\nlower limits on the nucleon lifetime with respect to these channels. The\nobtained values appear to be promising for probing the antibaryonic dark matter\nat future underground experiments like HyperK and DUNE.\n", "  We present high precision measurements of elliptic flow near midrapidity\n($|y|<1.0$) for multi-strange hadrons and $\\phi$ meson as a function of\ncentrality and transverse momentum in Au+Au collisions at center of mass energy\n$\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$ 200 GeV. We observe that the transverse momentum dependence of\n$\\phi$ and $\\Omega$ $v_{2}$ is similar to that of $\\pi$ and $p$, respectively,\nwhich may indicate that the heavier strange quark flows as strongly as the\nlighter up and down quarks. This observation constitutes a clear piece of\nevidence for the development of partonic collectivity in heavy-ion collisions\nat the top RHIC energy. Number of constituent quark scaling is found to hold\nwithin statistical uncertainty for both 0-30$\\%$ and 30-80$\\%$ collision\ncentrality. There is an indication of the breakdown of previously observed mass\nordering between $\\phi$ and proton $v_{2}$ at low transverse momentum in the\n0-30$\\%$ centrality range, possibly indicating late hadronic interactions\naffecting the proton $v_{2}$.\n", "  The theoretical description of the anomalous ferroelectric, ferromagnetic and\nmagnetoelectric properties of Pb(Fe1/2Ta1/2)x(Zr0.53Ti0.47)1-xO3 and\nPb(Fe1/2Nb1/2)x(Zr0.53Ti0.47)1-xO3 micro-ceramics is given. We performed\ncalculations of temperature, composition and external field dependence of\nferroelectric, ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic phases transition\ntemperatures, remanent polarization, magnetization, hysteresis loops, coercive\nfields, dielectric permittivity and magnetoelectric coupling. Special attention\nwas paid to comparison of the developed theory with experiments. It appeared\npossible to describe adequately the main experimental results including a\nreasonable agreement between the shape of calculated hysteresis loops and\nremnant polarization value with measured loops and polarization. Information\nabout linear and nonlinear magnetoelectric coupling coefficients was extracted\nfrom the experimental data. From the fitting of experimental data with\ntheoretical formula it appeared possible to obtain composition dependence of\nCurie-Weiss constant that is known to be inversely proportional to harmonic\n(linear) dielectric stiffness, as well as the strong nonlinear dependence of\nanharmonic parameters of free energy. Keeping in mind the essential influence\nof these parameters on the multiferroic properties the obtained results open\nthe way to govern practically all the material properties with the help of\nsuitable choice of composition. The forecast of the strong enough influence of\nantiferrodistortive order parameter on the transition temperatures and so on\nthe phase diagrams and properties of multiferroics is made on the basis of the\ndeveloped theory.\n", "  The transfer-free synthesis of high-quality, large-area graphene on a given\ndielectric substrate, which is highly desirable for device applications,\nremains a significant challenge. In this paper, we report on a simple rapid\nthermal treatment method for the fast and direct growth of high-quality,\nlarge-scale monolayer graphene on a SiO2/Si substrate from solid carbon\nsources. The stack structure of solid carbon layer/copper film/SiO2 is adopted\nin the RTT process. The inserted copper film does not only act as an active\ncatalyst for the carbon precursor but also serves as a \"filter\" that prevents\npremature carbon dissolution, and thus, contributes to monolayer graphene\ngrowth on SiO2/Si. The produced monolayer graphene exhibits high carrier\nmobility of up to 3000 cm2 V-1s-1 at room temperature and standard half-integer\nquantum oscillations.\n", "  We consider thermodynamics of the excluded volume particles at finite\ntemperature and chemical potential, in the low density approximation. We assume\nBoltzmann statistics and study the influence of the excluded volume on an ideal\ngas thermodynamics at the same temperature, pressure and numbers of particles.\nWe show, that considering the change of the free enthalpy due to the excluded\nvolume, and using the Maxwell identities, one can derive relevant thermodynamic\nfunctions and parameters of multi-component gases. The derivation is quite\ngeneral as particles may have different sizes and shapes which can also depend\non their momenta. Besides it's simplicity and generality, our approach has the\nadvantage of eliminating the transcendental equations occurring in earlier\nstudies. A representative example of the excluded volume thermodynamics is the\nsingle-component gas of hard spheres. For this case, using the viral expansion,\nthe validity limits of the low-density approximation are also discussed.\n", "  Due to discretization effects and truncation to finite domains, many\nelectromagnetic simulations present non-physical modifications of Maxwell's\nequations in space that may generate spurious signals affecting the overall\naccuracy of the result. Such modifications for instance occur when Perfectly\nMatched Layers (PMLs) are used at simulation domain boundaries to simulate open\nmedia. Another example is the use of arbitrary order Maxwell solver with domain\ndecomposition technique that may under some condition involve stencil\ntruncations at subdomain boundaries, resulting in small spurious errors that do\neventually build up. In each case, a careful evaluation of the characteristics\nand magnitude of the errors resulting from these approximations, and their\nimpact at any frequency and angle, requires detailed analytical and numerical\nstudies. To this end, we present a general analytical approach that enables the\nevaluation of numerical discretization errors of fully three-dimensional\narbitrary order finite-difference Maxwell solver, with arbitrary modification\nof the local stencil in the simulation domain. The analytical model is\nvalidated against simulations of domain decomposition technique and PMLs, when\nthese are used with very high-order Maxwell solver, as well as in the infinite\norder limit of pseudo-spectral solvers. Results confirm that the new analytical\napproach enables exact predictions in each case. It also confirms that the\ndomain decomposition technique can be used with very high-order Maxwell solver\nand a reasonably low number of guard cells with negligible effects on the whole\naccuracy of the simulation.\n", "  A simple and analytical formula is suggested to solve the problems of the\nlocal burnup and the isotope distributions. The present method considers two\nextreme conditions of neutrons penetrating the fuel rod. Based on these\nconsiderations, the formula is obtained to calculate the reaction rates of\n$^{235}$U, $^{238}$U, and $^{239}$Pu and straightforward the local burnup and\nthe isotope distributions. Starting from an initial burnup level, the\nparameters of the formula are fitted to the reaction rates given by a Monte\nCarlo (MC) calculation. Then the present formula independently gives very\nsimilar results as the MC calculation from the starting to high burnup level,\nbut takes just a few minutes. The relative reaction rates are found to be\nalmost independent on the radius (except $(n,\\gamma)$ of $^{238}$U) and the\nburnup, providing a solid background for the present formula. A more realistic\nexamination is also performed when the fuel rods locate in an assembly. A\ncombination of the present formula and the MC calculation is expected to have a\nnice balance on the accuracy and the cost on time.\n", "  Mo$_3$Sb$_7$ single crystals lightly doped with Cr, Ru, or Te are studied in\norder to explore the interplay between superconductivity, magnetism, and the\ncubic-tetragonal structural transition. The structural transition at 53\\,K is\nextremely sensitive to Ru or Te substitution which introduce additional\nelectrons, but robust against Cr substitution. No sign of a structure\ntransition was observed in superconducting Mo$_{2.91}$Ru$_{0.09}$Sb$_7$ and\nMo$_3$Sb$_{6.975}$Te$_{0.025}$. In contrast, 3at\\% Cr doping only slightly\nsuppresses the structural transition to 48\\,K while leaving no trace of\nsuperconductivity above 1.8\\,K. Analysis of magnetic properties suggests that\nthe interdimer interaction in Mo$_3$Sb$_7$ is near a critical value and\nessential for the structural transition. All dopants suppress the\nsuperconductivity of Mo$_3$Sb$_7$. The tetragonal structure is not necessary\nfor superconductivity.\n", "  We demonstrate how cosmic star-formation history can be measured with\none-point statistics of carbon-monoxide intensity maps. Using a P(D) analysis,\nthe luminosity function of CO-emitting sources can be inferred from the\nmeasured one-point intensity PDF. The star-formation rate density (SFRD) can\nthen be obtained, at several redshifts, from the CO luminosity density. We\nstudy the effects of instrumental noise, line foregrounds, and target redshift,\nand obtain constraints on the CO luminosity density of order 10%. We show that\nthe SFRD uncertainty is dominated by that of the model connecting CO luminosity\nand star formation. For pessimistic estimates of this model uncertainty, we\nobtain an error of order 50% on SFRD for surveys targeting redshifts between 2\nand 7 with reasonable noise and foregrounds included. However, comparisons\nbetween intensity maps and galaxies could substantially reduce this model\nuncertainty. In this case our constraints on SFRD at these redshifts improve to\nroughly 5-10%, which is highly competitive with current measurements.\n", "  In the classic theory of solid adhesion, surface energy drives deformation to\nincrease contact area while bulk elasticity opposes it. Recently, solid surface\nstress has been shown also to play an important role in opposing deformation of\nsoft materials. This suggests that the contact line in soft adhesion should\nmimic that of a liquid droplet, with a contact angle determined by surface\ntensions. Consistent with this hypothesis, we observe a contact angle of a soft\nsilicone substrate on rigid silica spheres that depends on the surface\nfunctionalization but not the sphere size. However, to satisfy this wetting\ncondition without a divergent elastic stress, the gel separates from its\nsolvent near the contact line. This creates a four-phase contact zone with two\nadditional contact lines hidden below the surface of the substrate. While the\ngeometries of these contact lines are independent of the size of the sphere,\nthe volume of the phase-separated region is not, but rather depends on the\nindentation volume. These results indicate that theories of adhesion of soft\ngels need to account for both the compressibility of the gel network and a\nnon-zero surface stress between the gel and its solvent.\n", "  Mixtures of polarised fermions of two different masses can form weakly-bound\nclusters, such as dimers and trimers, that are universally described by the\nscattering length between the heavy and light fermions. We use the resonating\ngroup method to investigate the low-energy scattering processes involving\ndimers or trimers. The method reproduces approximately the known particle-dimer\nand dimer-dimer scattering lengths. We use it to estimate the trimer-trimer\nscattering length, which is presently unknown, and find it to be positive.\n", "  This work presents new parallelizable numerical schemes for the integration\nof Dissipative Particle Dynamics with Energy conservation (DPDE). So far, no\nnumerical scheme introduced in the literature is able to correctly preserve the\nenergy over long times and give rise to small errors on average properties for\nmoderately small timesteps, while being straightforwardly parallelizable. We\npresent in this article two new methods, both straightforwardly parallelizable,\nallowing to correctly preserve the total energy of the system. We illustrate\nthe accuracy and performance of these new schemes both on equilibrium and\nnonequilibrium parallel simulations.\n", "  We study the stellar halo color properties of six nearby massive highly\ninclined disk galaxies using Hubble Space Telescope Advanced Camera for Surveys\nand Wide Field Camera 3 observations in both F606W and F814W filters from the\nGHOSTS survey. The observed fields, placed both along the minor and major axis\nof each galaxy, probe the stellar outskirts out to projected distances of ~\n50-70 kpc from their galactic centre along the minor axis. The 50% completeness\nlevels of the color magnitude diagrams are typically at two mag below the tip\nof the red giant branch. We find that all galaxies have extended stellar halos\nout to ~ 50 kpc and two out to ~ 70 kpc. We determined the halo color\ndistribution and color profile for each galaxy using the median colors of stars\nin the RGB. Within each galaxy we find variations in the median colors as a\nfunction of radius which likely indicates population variations, reflecting\nthat their outskirts were built from several small accreted objects. We find\nthat half of the galaxies (NGC 0891, NGC 4565, and NGC 7814) present a clear\nnegative color gradient, reflecting a declining metallicity in their halos; the\nother have no significant color or population gradient. In addition,\nnotwithstanding the modest sample size of galaxies, there is no strong\ncorrelation between their halo color/metallicity or gradient with galaxy's\nproperties such as rotational velocity or stellar mass. The diversity in halo\ncolor profiles observed in the GHOSTS galaxies qualitatively supports the\npredicted galaxy-to-galaxy scatter in halo stellar properties; a consequence of\nthe stochasticity inherent in the assembling history of galaxies.\n", "  We present calculations on the formation of massive black holes with 10^5\nMsun at z > 6 that can be the seeds of supermassive black holes at z > 6. Under\nthe assumption of compact star cluster formation in merging galaxies, star\nclusters in haloes of 10^8 ~ 10^9 Msun can undergo rapid core-collapse leading\nto the formation of very massive stars (VMSs) with ~1000 Msun which directly\ncollapse into black holes with similar masses. Star clusters in halos of > 10^9\nMsun experience type-II supernovae before the formation of VMSs due to long\ncore-collapse time scales. We also model the subsequent growth of black holes\nvia accretion of residual stars in clusters. 2-body relaxation efficiently\nre-fills the loss cones of stellar orbits at larger radii and resonant\nrelaxation at small radii is the main driver for accretion of stars onto black\nholes. As a result, more than ninety percent of stars in the initial cluster\nare swallowed by the central black holes before z=6. Using dark matter merger\ntrees we derive black hole mass functions at z=6-20. The mass function ranges\nfrom 10^3 to 10^5 Msun at z <~ 15. Major merging of galaxies of >~ 4*10^8 Msun\nat z ~ 20 successfully leads to the formation of >~ 10^5 Msun BHs by z >~ 10\nwhich can be the potential seeds of supermassive black holes seen today.\n", "  Measuring similarities/dissimilarities between atomic structures is important\nfor the exploration of potential energy landscapes. However, the cell vectors\ntogether with the coordinates of the atoms, which are generally used to\ndescribe periodic systems, are quantities not suitable as fingerprints to\ndistinguish structures. Based on a characterization of the local environment of\nall atoms in a cell we introduce crystal fingerprints that can be calculated\neasily and allow to define configurational distances between crystalline\nstructures that satisfy the mathematical properties of a metric. This distance\nbetween two configurations is a measure of their similarity/dissimilarity and\nit allows in particular to distinguish structures. The new method is an useful\ntool within various energy landscape exploration schemes, such as minima\nhopping, random search, swarm intelligence algorithms and high-throughput\nscreenings.\n", "  In this paper, we investigate the effect of \"heterogeneity of link weight\",\nheterogeneity of the frequency or amount of interactions among individuals, on\nthe evolution of cooperation. Based on an analysis of the evolutionary\nprisoner's dilemma game on a weighted one-dimensional lattice network with\n\"intra-individual heterogeneity\", we confirm that moderate level of link-weight\nheterogeneity can facilitate cooperation. Furthermore, we identify two key\nmechanisms by which link-weight heterogeneity promotes the evolution of\ncooperation: mechanisms for spread and maintenance of cooperation. We also\nderive the corresponding conditions under which the mechanisms can work through\nevolutionary dynamics.\n", "  We study the formation of bands of colloidal particles driven by periodic\nexternal fields. Using Brownian dynamics, we determine the dependence of the\nband width on the strength of the particle interactions and on the intensity\nand periodicity of the field. We also investigate the switching (field-on)\ndynamics and the relaxation times as a function of the system parameters. The\nobserved scaling relations were analyzed using a simple dynamic\ndensity-functional theory of fluids.\n", "  Recent breakthroughs in the experimental manipulation of strongly interacting\natomic Rydberg gases in lattice potentials have opened a new avenue for the\nstudy of many-body phenomena. Considerable efforts are currently being\nundertaken to achieve clean experimental settings that show a minimal amount of\nnoise and disorder and are close to zero temperature. A complementary direction\ninvestigates the interplay between coherent and dissipative processes. Recent\nexperiments have revealed a first glimpse into the emergence of a rich\nnon-equilibrium behavior stemming from the competition of laser excitation,\nstrong interactions and radiative decay of Rydberg atoms. The aim of the\npresent theoretical work is to show that local incoherent loss and gain of\natoms can in fact be the source of interesting out-of-equilibrium dynamics.\nThis perspective opens new paths for the exploration of non-equilibrium\ncritical phenomena and, more generally, phase transitions, some of which so far\nhave been rather difficult to study. To demonstrate the richness of the\nencountered dynamical behavior we consider here three examples. The first two\nfeature local atom loss and gain together with an incoherent excitation of\nRydberg states. In this setting either a continuous or a discontinuous phase\ntransition emerges with the former being reminiscent of genuine non-equilibrium\ntransitions of stochastic processes with multiple absorbing states. The third\nexample considers the regime of coherent laser excitation. Here the many-body\ndynamics is dominated by an equilibrium transition of the \"model A\"\nuniversality class.\n", "  We study two-dimensional Hamiltonians in phase space with noncommutativity\nboth in coordinates and momenta. We consider the generator of rotations on the\nnoncommutative plane and the Lie algebra generated by Hermitian rotationally\ninvariant quadratic forms of noncommutative dynamical variables. We show that\ntwo quantum phases are possible, characterized by the Lie algebras\n$sl(2,\\mathbb{R})$ or $su(2)$ according to the relation between the\nnoncommutativity parameters, with the rotation generator related with the\nCasimir operator. From this algebraic perspective, we analyze the spectrum of\nsome simple models with nonrelativistic rotationally invariant Hamiltonians in\nthis noncommutative phase space, as the isotropic harmonic oscillator, the\nLandau problem and the cylindrical well potential.\n  PACS: 03.65.-w; 03.65.Fd\n  MSC: 81R05; 20C35; 22E70\n", "  We study exclusive vector meson photoproduction, $\\gamma p \\to V + p$ with\n$V=J/\\psi$ or $\\Upsilon$, at NLO in collinear factorisation, in order to\nexamine what may be learnt about the gluon distribution at very low $x$. We\nexamine the factorisation scale dependence of the predictions. We argue that,\nusing knowledge of the NLO corrections, terms enhanced by a large $\\ln(1/\\xi)$\ncan be reabsorbed in the LO part by a choice of the factorisation scale. (In\nthese exclusive processes $\\xi$ takes the role of Bjorken-$x$.) Then, the scale\ndependence coming from the remaining NLO contributions has no $\\ln(1/\\xi)$\nenhancements. As a result, we find that predictions for the amplitude of\n$\\Upsilon$ production are stable to within about $\\pm 15\\%$. This will allow\ndata for the exclusive process $p p \\to p\\Upsilon p$ at the LHC, particularly\nfrom LHCb, to be included in global parton analyses to constrain the gluon PDF\ndown to $x\\sim 10^{-5}$. Moreover, the study of exclusive $J/\\psi$\nphotoproduction indicates that the gluon density found in the recent global PDF\nanalyses is too small at low $x$ and low scales.\n", "  Fermionic dark matter interacting with the Standard Model sector through a\npseudoscalar portal could evade the direct detection constraints while\npreserving a WIMP miracle. We study the LHC constraints on the pseudoscalar\nproduction in simplified models with the pseudoscalar either dominantly coupled\nto b quarks or tau leptons and explore their implications for the GeV excesses\nin gamma ray observations. We also investigate models with new vector-like\nfermions that could realize the simplified models of pseudoscalar portal dark\nmatter. These models yield new decay channels and signatures of vector-like\nfermions, for instance, bbb, btautau, and tautautau resonances. Some of the\nsignatures have already been strongly constrained by the existing LHC searches\nand the parameter space fitting the gamma ray excess is further restricted. On\nthe other hand, the pure tau-rich final state is only weakly constrained so far\ndue to the small electroweak production rate.\n", "  The dual observables as order parameters for center symmetry are tested at\nfinite isospin chemical potential $\\mu_I$ in a Polyakov-loop enhanced chiral\nmodel of QCD with physical quark masses. As a counterpart of the dressed\nPolyakov-loop, the first Fourier moment of pion condensate is introduced for\n$\\mu_I>{m_\\pi}/{2}$ under the temporal twisted boundary conditions for quarks.\nWe demonstrate that this dual condensate exhibits the similar temperature\ndependence as the conventional Polyakov-loop. We confirm that its rapid\nincrease with $T$ is driven by the evaporating of pion condensation. On the\nother hand, the dressed Polyakov-loop shows abnormal thermal behavior, which\neven decreases with $T$ at low temperatures due to the influence of pion\ncondensate. We thus argue that in QCD the critical temperature extracting from\na dual observable may have nothing to do with the quark\nconfinement-deconfinement transition if the quark mass is very small.\n", "  In this paper, we explore a novel observational signature of gravitational\ncorrections during slow-roll inflation. We study the coupling of the inflaton\nfield to higher-curvature tensors in models with a minimal breaking of\nconformal symmetry. In that case, the most general correction to the tensor\ntwo-point function is captured by a coupling to the square of the Weyl tensor.\nWe show that these scenarios lead to a correction to the tilt of the tensor\npower spectrum and hence a violation of the tensor consistency condition. We\narrive at the same conclusion through an analysis in conformal perturbation\ntheory.\n", "  The eigenvalues of the matrix structure $X + X^{(0)}$, where $X$ is a random\nGaussian Hermitian matrix and $X^{(0)}$ is non-random or random independent of\n$X$, are closely related to Dyson Brownian motion. Previous works have shown\nhow an infinite hierarchy of equations satisfied by the dynamical correlations\nbecome triangular in the infinite density limit, and give rise to the complex\nBurgers equation for the Green's function of the corresponding one-point\ndensity function. We show how this and analogous partial differential\nequations, for chiral, circular and Jacobi versions of Dyson Brownian motion\nfollow from a macroscopic hydrodynamical description involving the current\ndensity and continuity equation. The method of characteristics gives a\nsystematic approach to solving the PDEs, and in the chiral case we show how\nthis efficiently reclaims the characterisation of the global eigenvalue density\nfor non-central Wishart matrices due to Dozier and Silverstein. Collective\nvariables provide another approach to deriving the complex Burgers equation in\nthe Gaussian case, and we show that this approach applies equally as well to\nchiral matrices. We relate both the Gaussian and chiral cases to the\nasymptotics of matrix integrals.\n", "  Orbital-free density functional theory (OF-DFT) is a promising method for\nlarge-scale quantum mechanics simulation as it provides a good balance of\naccuracy and computational cost. Its applicability to large-scale simulations\nhas been aided by progress in constructing kinetic energy functionals and local\npseudopotentials. However, the widespread adoption of OF-DFT requires further\nimprovement in its efficiency and robustly implemented software. Here we\ndevelop a real-space finite-difference method for the numerical solution of\nOF-DFT in periodic systems. Instead of the traditional self-consistent method,\na powerful scheme for energy minimization is introduced to solve the\nEuler--Lagrange equation. Our approach engages both the real-space\nfinite-difference method and a direct energy-minimization scheme for the OF-DFT\ncalculations. The method is coded into the ATLAS software package and\nbenchmarked using periodic systems of solid Mg, Al, and Al$_{3}$Mg. The test\nresults show that our implementation can achieve high accuracy, efficiency, and\nnumerical stability for large-scale simulations.\n", "  We describe ellipticity domains for the isochoric elastic energy $ F\\mapsto\n\\|{\\rm dev}_n\\log U\\|^2=\\bigg\\|\\log \\frac{\\sqrt{F^TF}}{(\\det F)^{1/n}}\\bigg\\|^2\n=\\frac{1}{4}\\,\\bigg\\|\\log \\frac{C}{({\\rm det} C)^{1/n}}\\bigg\\|^2 $ for $n=2,3$,\nwhere $C=F^TF$ for $F\\in {\\rm GL}^+(n)$. Here, ${\\rm dev}_n\\log {U} =\\log\n{U}-\\frac{1}{n}\\, {\\rm tr}(\\log {U})\\cdot 1\\!\\!1$ is the deviatoric part of the\nlogarithmic strain tensor $\\log U$. For $n=2$ we identify the maximal\nellipticity domain, while for $n=3$ we show that the energy is\nLegendre-Hadamard elliptic in the set $\\mathcal{E}_3\\bigg(W_{_{\\rm H}}^{\\rm\niso}, {\\rm LH}, U, \\frac{2}{3}\\bigg)\\,:=\\,\\bigg\\{U\\in{\\rm PSym}(3) \\;\\Big|\\,\n\\|{\\rm dev}_3\\log U\\|^2\\leq \\frac{2}{3}\\bigg\\}$, which is similar to the\nvon-Mises-Huber-Hencky maximum distortion strain energy criterion.\n  Our results complement the characterization of ellipticity domains for the\nquadratic Hencky energy $ W_{_{\\rm H}}(F)=\\mu \\,\\|{\\rm dev}_3\\log U\\|^2+\n\\frac{\\kappa}{2}\\,[{\\rm tr} (\\log U)]^2 $, $U=\\sqrt{F^TF}$ with $\\mu>0$ and\n$\\kappa>\\frac{2}{3}\\, \\mu$, previously obtained by Bruhns et al.\n", "  A fundamental issue that limits the efficiency of many photoelectrochemical\nsystems is that the photon absorption length is typically much longer than the\nelectron diffusion length. Various photon management schemes have been\ndeveloped to enhance light absorption; one simple approach is to use randomly\nscattering media to enable broadband and wide-angle enhancement. However, such\nsystems are often opaque, making it difficult to probe photo-induced processes.\nHere we use wave interference effects to modify the spatial distribution of\nlight inside a highly-scattering dye-sensitized solar cell to control photon\nabsorption in a space-dependent manner. By shaping the incident wavefront of a\nlaser beam, we enhance or suppress photocurrent by increasing or decreasing\nlight concentration on the front side of the mesoporous photoanode where the\ncollection efficiency of photoelectrons is maximal. Enhanced light absorption\nis achieved by reducing reflection through the open boundary of the photoanode\nvia destructive interference, leading to a factor of two increase in\nphotocurrent. This approach opens the door to probing and manipulating\nphotoelectrochemical processes in specific regions inside nominally opaque\nmedia.\n", "  One of the long-standing problems in antenna engineering is the realization\nof highly-directive beams using low-profile devices. In this paper we provide a\nsolution to this problem by means of Huygens' metasurfaces (HMSs), based on the\nequivalence principle. This principle states that a given excitation can be\ntransformed to a desirable aperture field by inducing suitable electric and\nmagnetic surface currents. Building on this concept, we propose and demonstrate\ncavity-excited HMS antennas, where the single-source cavity excitation is\ndesigned to optimize aperture illumination, while the HMS facilitates the\ncurrent distribution that ensures phase purity of aperture fields. The HMS\nbreaks the coupling between the excitation and radiation spectrum typical to\nstandard partially-reflecting surfaces, allowing tailoring of the aperture\nproperties to produce a desirable radiation pattern. As shown, a single\nsemianalytical formalism can be followed to achieve control of a variety of\nradiation features, such as the direction of the main beam or the side lobe\nlevel, by proper modification of the HMS and the source position. Relying on a\ncavity excitation, this can be achieved without incurring edge-taper losses and\nwithout any degradation of the aperture illumination for arbitrarily-large\napertures. With the recent demonstrations of Huygens' metasurfaces at\nmicrowave, terahertz, and optical frequencies, the proposed low-profile design\nmay find its use in a myriad of applications across the electromagnetic\nspectrum, from highly-directive antennas to highly-efficient quantum-dot\nemitters, reaching near-unity aperture efficiencies.\n", "  Spin-orbit interaction (SOI) leads to spin precession about a\nmomentum-dependent spin-orbit field. In a diffusive two-dimensional (2D)\nelectron gas, the spin orientation at a given spatial position depends on which\ntrajectory the electron travels to that position. In the transition to a 1D\nsystem with increasing lateral confinement, the spin orientation becomes more\nand more independent on the trajectory. It is predicted that a long-lived\nhelical spin mode emerges. Here we visualize this transition experimentally in\na GaAs quantum-well structure with isotropic SOI. Spatially resolved\nmeasurements show the formation of a helical mode already for non-quantized and\nnon-ballistic channels. We find a spin-lifetime enhancement that is in\nexcellent agreement with theoretical predictions. Lateral confinement of a 2D\nelectron gas provides an easy-to-implement technique for achieving high spin\nlifetimes in the presence of strong SOI for a wide range of material systems.\n", "  We have developed UFCORIN, a platform for studying and automating space\nweather prediction. Using our system we have tested 6,160 different\ncombinations of SDO/HMI data as input data, and simulated the prediction of\nGOES X-ray flux for 2 years (2011-2012) with one-hour cadence. We have found\nthat direct comparison of the true skill statistics (TSS) from small\ncross-validation sets is ill-posed, and used the standard scores ($z$) of the\nTSS to compare the performance of the various prediction strategies. The $z$ of\na strategy is a stochastic variable of the stochastically-chosen\ncross-validation dataset, and the $z$ for the three strategies best at\npredicting X, $\\geq$M and $\\geq$C class flares are better than the average $z$\nof the 6,160 strategies by 2.3$\\sigma$, 2.1$\\sigma$, 3.8$\\sigma$ confidence\nlevels, respectively. The best three TSS values were $0.75\\pm0.07$,\n$0.48\\pm0.02$, and $0.56\\pm0.04$, respectively.\n", "  First principle calculations of the conductance of gold wires containing 3-8\natoms each with 2.39 {\\AA} bond length were performed using density functional\ntheory. Three different configuration of wire/electrodes were used. For zigzag\nwire with semi-infinite crystalline electrodes, even-odd oscillation is\nobserved which is consistent with the previously reported results. A lower\nconductance was observed for the chain in semi-infinite crystalline electrodes\ncompared to the chains suspended in wire-like electrode. The calculated\ntransmission spectrum for the straight and zig-zag wires suspended between\nsemi-infinite crystalline electrodes showed suppression of transmission\nchannels due to electron scattering occurring at the electrode-wire interface.\n", "  This paper discusses recent results and near-term prospects of the\nlong-baseline neutrino experiments MINOS, MINOS+, T2K and NOvA. The non-zero\nvalue of the third neutrino mixing angle {\\theta}13 allows experimental\nanalysis in a manner which explicitly exhibits appearance and disappearance\ndependencies on additional parameters associated with mass-hierarchy, CP\nviolation, and any non-maximal {\\theta}23. These current and near-future\nexperiments begin the era of precision accelerator long-baseline measurements\nand lay the framework within which future experimental results will be\ninterpreted.\n", "  We propose a measurement of the top Yukawa coupling at a 100 TeV hadron\ncollider, based on boosted Higgs and top decays. We find that the top Yukawa\ncoupling can be measured to 1%, with excellent handles for reducing systematic\nand theoretical uncertainties, both from side bands and from\n$t\\bar{t}H/t\\bar{t}Z$ ratios.\n", "  We introduce and study the task of assisted coherence distillation. This task\narises naturally in bipartite systems where both parties work together to\ngenerate the maximal possible coherence on one of the subsystems. Only\nincoherent operations are allowed on the target system while general local\nquantum operations are permitted on the other, an operational paradigm that we\ncall local quantum-incoherent operations and classical communication (LQICC).\nWe show that the asymptotic rate of assisted coherence distillation for pure\nstates is equal to the coherence of assistance, an analog of the entanglement\nof assistance, whose properties we characterize. Our findings imply a novel\ninterpretation of the von Neumann entropy: it quantifies the maximum amount of\nextra quantum coherence a system can gain when receiving assistance from a\ncollaborative party. Our results are generalized to coherence localization in a\nmultipartite setting and possible applications are discussed.\n", "  The theory and phenomenology of light sterile neutrinos at the eV mass scale\nis reviewed. The reactor, Gallium and LSND anomalies are briefly described and\ninterpreted as indications of the existence of short-baseline oscillations\nwhich require the existence of light sterile neutrinos. The global fits of\nshort-baseline oscillation data in 3+1 and 3+2 schemes are discussed, together\nwith the implications for beta-decay and neutrinoless double-beta decay. The\ncosmological effects of light sterile neutrinos are briefly reviewed and the\nimplications of existing cosmological data are discussed. The review concludes\nwith a summary of future perspectives.\n", "  A new approach for the construction of finite action solutions of the\nsupersymmetric $\\mathbb{C}P^{N-1}$ sigma model is presented. We show that this\napproach produces more non-holomorphic solutions than those obtained in\nprevious approaches. We study the $\\mathbb{C}P^2$ model in detail and present\nits solutions in an explicit form. We also show how to generalise this\nconstruction to $N>3$.\n", "  The crystal structure, electronic and magnetic properties of the new\nfull-Heusler compounds Zr2MnZ (Z=Al, Ga, In), were studied within the Density\nFunctional Theory (DFT) framework. The materials exhibit unique properties that\nconnect the spin gapless semiconducting character with the completely\ncompensated ferrimagnetism. In magnetic configurations, Zr2MnZ (Z=Al, Ga, In)\ncrystallize in inverse Heusler structure, are stable against decomposition and\nhave zero magnetic moment per formula unit properties, in agreement with\nSlater-Pauling rule. The Zr2MnAl compound presents spin gapless semiconducting\nproperties with a energy band gap of 0.41 eV in the majority spin channel and a\nzero band gap in the minority spin channel. By substituting Ga or In elements,\nfor Al in Zr2MnAl, semiconducting pseudo band gaps are formed in the majority\nspin channels due to the different neighborhood around the manganese atoms,\nwhich decreases the energy of Mn's triple degenerated anti-bonding states.\n", "  We determine analytically the dependence of the approach to thermal\nequilibrium of strongly coupled plasmas on the breaking of scale invariance.\nThe theories we consider are the holographic duals to Einstein gravity coupled\nto a scalar with an exponential potential. The coefficient in the exponent,\n$X$, is the parameter that controls the deviation from the conformally\ninvariant case. For these models we obtain analytic solutions for the plasma\nexpansion in the late-time limit, under the assumption of boost-invariance, and\nwe determine the scaling behaviour of the energy density, pressure, and\ntemperature as a function of time. We find that the temperature decays as a\nfunction of proper time as $T\\sim \\tau^{-s/4}$ with $s$ determined in terms of\nthe non-conformality parameter $X$ as $s=4(1-4X^2)/3$. This agrees with the\nresult of Janik and Peschanski, $s=4/3$, for the conformal plasmas and\ngeneralizes it to non-conformal plasmas with $X\\neq 0$. We also consider more\nrealistic potentials where the exponential is supplemented by power-law terms.\nEven though in this case we cannot have exact solutions, we are able under\ncertain assumptions to determine the scaling of the energy, that receives\nlogarithmic corrections.\n", "  There exists a growing evidence for the anomalous transparency of the\nUniverse for energetic gamma rays. Popular explanations include conversion of\nphotons into hypothetical axion-like particles (ALPs) and back in astrophysical\nmagnetic fields. Two distinctive scenarios of this conversion have been put\nforward: either it happens in the (host galaxy of the) gamma-ray source and in\nthe Milky Way, or the photon-ALP oscillations take place in the intergalactic\nmagnetic fields all along the way between the source and the observer. Here we\npoint out that, given recent astrophysical constraints on ALPs and on\nintergalactic magnetic fields, these two mechanisms imply very different ALP\nmasses and couplings. Therefore, confirmation of the anomalies and\nidentification of one of the scenarios would mean cornering of ALP parameters\nto a particular narrow region. We discuss approaches to distinguish between the\ntwo mechanisms and present some preliminary indications in favour of the\ngalactic scenario.\n", "  We study graphene which has both spin-orbit coupling (SOC), taken to be of\nthe Kane-Mele form, and a Zeeman field induced due to proximity to a\nferromagnetic material. We show that a zigzag interface of graphene having SOC\nwith its pristine counterpart hosts robust chiral edge modes in spite of the\ngapless nature of the pristine graphene; such modes do not occur for armchair\ninterfaces. Next we study the change in the local density of states (LDOS) due\nto the presence of an impurity in graphene with SOC and Zeeman field, and\ndemonstrate that the Fourier transform of the LDOS close to the Dirac points\ncan act as a measure of the strength of the spin-orbit coupling; in addition,\nfor a specific distribution of impurity atoms, the LDOS is controlled by a\ndestructive interference effect of graphene electrons which is a direct\nconsequence of their Dirac nature. Finally, we study transport across junctions\nwhich separates spin-orbit coupled graphene with Kane-Mele and Rashba terms\nfrom pristine graphene both in the presence and absence of a Zeeman field. We\ndemonstrate that such junctions are generally spin active, namely, they can\nrotate the spin so that an incident electron which is spin polarized along some\ndirection has a finite probability of being transmitted with the opposite spin.\nThis leads to a finite, electrically controllable, spin current in such\ngraphene junctions. We discuss possible experiments which can probe our\ntheoretical predictions.\n", "  We consider the one-dimensional Cattaneo equation for transport of scalar\nfields such as solute concentration and temperature in mass and heat transport\nproblems, respectively. Although the Cattaneo equation admits a stochastic\ninterpretation - at least in the one-dimensional case - negative concentration\nvalues can occur in boundary-value problems on a finite interval. This\nphenomenon stems from the probabilistic nature of this model: the stochastic\ninterpretation provides constraints on the admissible boundary conditions, as\ncan be deduced from the wave formulation here presented. Moreover, as here\nshown, energetic inequalities and the dissipative nature of the equation\nprovide an alternative way to derive the same constraints on the boundary\nconditions derived by enforcing positivity. The analysis reported is also\nextended to transport problems in the presence of a biasing velocity field.\nSeveral general conclusions are drawn from this analysis that could be extended\nto the higher-dimensional case.\n", "  We analyze the influence of reflective boundary conditions on the statistics\nof Poisson-Kac diffusion processes, and specifically how they modify the\nPoissonian switching-time statistics. After addressing simple cases such as\ndiffusion in a channel, and the switching statistics in the presence of a\npolarization potential, we thoroughly study Poisson-Kac diffusion in fractal\ndomains. Diffusion in fractal spaces highlights neatly how the modification in\nthe switching-time statistics associated with reflections against a complex and\nfractal boundary induces new emergent features of Poisson-Kac diffusion leading\nto a transition from a regular behavior at shorter timescales to emerging\nanomalous diffusion properties controlled by walk dimensionality of the fractal\nset.\n", "  We consider quantum Hamiltonians of the form $H = H_0 - U \\sum_j \\cos(C_j)$\nwhere $H_0$ is a quadratic function of position and momentum variables $\\{x_1,\np_1, x_2, p_2,...\\}$ and the $C_j$'s are linear in these variables. We allow\n$H_0$ and $C_j$ to be completely general with only two restrictions: we require\nthat (1) the $C_j$'s are linearly independent and (2) $[C_j, C_k]$ is an\ninteger multiple of $2\\pi i$ for all $j,k$ so that the different cosine terms\ncommute with one another. Our main result is a recipe for solving these\nHamiltonians and obtaining their exact low energy spectrum in the limit $U\n\\rightarrow \\infty$. This recipe involves constructing creation and\nannihilation operators and is similar in spirit to the procedure for\ndiagonalizing quadratic Hamiltonians. In addition to our exact solution in the\ninfinite $U$ limit, we also discuss how to analyze these systems when $U$ is\nlarge but finite. Our results are relevant to a number of different physical\nsystems, but one of the most natural applications is to understanding the\neffects of electron scattering on quantum Hall edge modes. To demonstrate this\napplication, we use our formalism to solve a toy model for a fractional quantum\nspin Hall edge with different types of impurities.\n", "  X-ray images of galaxy clusters and gas-rich elliptical galaxies show a\nwealth of small-scale features which reflect fluctuations in density and/or\ntemperature of the intra-cluster medium. In this paper we study these\nfluctuations in M87/Virgo, to establish whether sound waves/shocks, bubbles or\nuplifted cold gas dominate the structure. We exploit the strong dependence of\nthe emissivity on density and temperature in different energy bands to\ndistinguish between these processes. Using simulations we demonstrate that our\nanalysis recovers the leading type of fluctuation even in the presence of\nprojection effects and temperature gradients. We confirm the isobaric nature of\ncool filaments of gas entrained by buoyantly rising bubbles, extending to 7' to\nthe east and south-west, and the adiabatic nature of the weak shocks at 40\" and\n3' from the center. For features of 5--10 kpc, we show that the central 4'x 4'\nregion is dominated by cool structures in pressure equilibrium with the ambient\nhotter gas while up to 30 percent of the variance in this region can be\nascribed to adiabatic fluctuations. The remaining part of the central 14'x14'\nregion, excluding the arms and shocks described above, is dominated by\napparently isothermal fluctuations (bubbles) with a possible admixture (at the\nlevel of about 30 percent) of adiabatic (sound waves) and by isobaric\nstructures. Larger features, of about 30 kpc, show a stronger contribution from\nisobaric fluctuations. The results broadly agree with an AGN feedback model\nmediated by bubbles of relativistic plasma.\n", "  Doping at the rare-earth site by divalent alkaline-earth ions in perovskite\nlattice has witnessed a variety of magnetic and electronic orders with\nspatially correlated charge, spin and orbital degrees of freedom. Here, we\nreport an antisite disorder driven spontaneous exchange bias effect as a result\nof hole carrier (Sr2+) doping in La2-xSrxCoMnO6 (0 < x < 1) double perovskites.\nX-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy have evidenced an increase in disorder\nwith the increase of Sr content up to x = 0.5 and thereby decreases from x =\n0.5 to 1. X-ray absorption spectroscopy has revealed that only Co is present in\nmixed valent Co2+ and Co3+ states with Sr doping to compensate the charge\nneutrality. Magnetotransport is strongly correlated with the increase of\nantisite disorder. The antisite disorder at the B-site interrupts the\nlong-range ferromagnetic order by introducing various magnetic interactions and\ninstigates reentrant glassy dynamics, phase separation and canted type\nantiferromagnetic behavior with the decrease of temperature. This leads to\nnovel magnetic microstructure with unidirectional anisotropy that causes\nspontaneous exchange bias effect that can be tuned with the amount of antisite\ndisorder.\n", "  The kagome lattice sits at the crossroad of present research efforts in\nquantum spin liquids, chiral phases, emergent skyrmion excitations and\nanomalous Hall effects to name but a few. In light of this diversity, our goal\nin this paper is to build a unifying picture of the underlying magnetic\ndegrees-of-freedom on kagome. Motivated by a growing mosaic of materials, we\nespecially consider a broad range of nearest-neighbour interactions consisting\nof Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya as well as anisotropic ferro$-$ and antiferromagnetic\ncoupling. We present a three-fold mapping on the kagome lattice which\ntransforms the celebrated Heisenberg antiferromagnet and XXZ model onto two\nlines of time-reversal invariant Hamiltonians. The mapping is exact for\nclassical and quantum spins alike, i.e. it preserves the energy spectrum of the\noriginal Heisenberg and XXZ models. As a consequence, at the classical level,\nall phases have an extensive ground-state degeneracy. These ground states\nsupport a variety of phenomena such as ferromagnetically induced pinch points\nin the structure factor and the possibility for spontaneous scalar chirality.\nFor quantum spin$-1/2$, the XXZ model has been recently shown to be a quantum\nspin liquid. Applying our three-fold mapping to the XXZ model gives rise to a\nconnected network of quantum spin liquids, centered around a paragon of quantum\ndisorder, namely the Ising antiferromagnet. We show that this quantum disorder\nspreads over an extended region of the phase diagram at linear order in spin\nwave theory, which overlaps with the parameter region of Herbertsmithite\nZnCu$_3$(OH)$_6$Cl$_2$. We conclude this work by discussing the connection of\nour results to the chiral spin liquids found on kagome with further\nnearest-neighbour interactions, and to the recently synthesized ternary\nintermetallic materials.\n", "  We initiate the construction of gauge fluxes in F-theory compactifications on\ngenus-one fibrations which only have a multi-section as opposed to a section.\nF-theory on such spaces gives rise to discrete gauge symmetries in the\neffective action. We generalize the transversality conditions on gauge fluxes\nknown for elliptic fibrations by taking into account the properties of the\navailable multi-section. We test these general conditions by constructing all\nvertical gauge fluxes in a bisection model with gauge group SU(5) x Z2. The\nnon-abelian anomalies are shown to vanish. These flux solutions are dynamically\nrelated to fluxes on a fibration with gauge group SU(5) x U(1) by a conifold\ntransition. Considerations of flux quantization reveal an arithmetic constraint\non certain intersection numbers on the base which must necessarily be satisfied\nin a smooth geometry. Combined with the proposed transversality conditions on\nthe fluxes these conditions are shown to imply cancellation of the discrete Z2\ngauge anomalies as required by general consistency considerations.\n", "  Topological defects such as magnetic solitons, vortices, Bloch lines, and\nskyrmions have started to play an important role in modern magnetism because of\ntheir extraordinary stability, which can be exploited in the production of\nmemory devices. Recently, a novel type of antisymmetric exchange interaction,\nnamely the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI), has been uncovered and\nfound to influence the formation of topological defects. Exploring how the DMI\naffects the dynamics of topological defects is therefore an important task.\nHere we investigate the dynamic domain wall (DW) under a strong DMI and find\nthat the DMI induces an annihilation of topological vertical Bloch lines (VBLs)\nby lifting the four-fold degeneracy of the VBL. As a result, velocity reduction\noriginating from the Walker breakdown is completely suppressed, leading to a\nsoliton-like constant velocity of the DW. Furthermore, the strength of the DMI,\nwhich is the key factor for soliton-like DW motion, can be quantified without\nany side effects possibly arising from current-induced torques or extrinsic\npinnings in magnetic films. Our results therefore shed light on the physics of\ndynamic topological defects, which paves the way for future work in\ntopology-based memory applications.\n", "  In this work, we study the radiative leptonic decays of $B^-$ and $D^-$\nmesons in the standard model and the two-Higgs-doublet-model type II. The\nresults are obtained using the factorization procedure, and the contribution of\nthe order $O(\\Lambda _{\\rm QCD}\\left/m_Q\\right.)$ is included. The numerical\nresults are calculated using the wave-function obtained in relativistic\npotential model. As a result, the decay mode $B\\to \\gamma \\tau \\nu_{\\tau}$ is\nfound to be sensitive to the effect of the charged Higgs boson. Using the\nconstraint on the free parameters of the two Higgs doublet model given in\nprevious works, we find the contribution of the charged Higgs boson in the\ndecay mode $B\\to \\gamma \\tau \\nu_{\\tau}$ can be as large as about $13\\%$.\n", "  As an example for complex systems with extreme events we investigate ocean\nwave states exhibiting rogue waves. We present a statistical method of data\nanalysis based on multi-point statistics which for the first time allows\ngrasping extreme rogue wave events in a statistically highly satisfactory\nmanner. The key to the success of the approach is mapping the complexity of\nmulti-point data onto the statistics of hierarchically ordered height\nincrements for different time scales for which we can show that a stochastic\ncascade process with Markov properties is governed by a Fokker-Planck equation.\nConditional probabilities as well as the Fokker-Planck equation itself can be\nestimated directly from the available observational data. With this stochastic\ndescription surrogate data sets can in turn be generated allowing to work out\narbitrary statistical features of the complex sea state in general and extreme\nrogue wave events in particular. The results also open up new perspectives for\nforecasting the occurrence probability of extreme rogue wave events, and even\nfor forecasting the occurrence of individual rogue waves based on precursory\ndynamics.\n", "  Understanding the theoretical foundations of how memories are encoded and\nretrieved in neural populations is a central challenge in neuroscience. A\npopular theoretical scenario for modeling memory function is the attractor\nneural network scenario, whose prototype is the Hopfield model. The model has a\npoor storage capacity, compared with the capacity achieved with perceptron\nlearning algorithms. Here, by transforming the perceptron learning rule, we\npresent an online learning rule for a recurrent neural network that achieves\nnear-maximal storage capacity without an explicit supervisory error signal,\nrelying only upon locally accessible information. The fully-connected network\nconsists of excitatory binary neurons with plastic recurrent connections and\nnon-plastic inhibitory feedback stabilizing the network dynamics; the memory\npatterns are presented online as strong afferent currents, producing a bimodal\ndistribution for the neuron synaptic inputs. Synapses corresponding to active\ninputs are modified as a function of the value of the local fields with respect\nto three thresholds. Above the highest threshold, and below the lowest\nthreshold, no plasticity occurs. In between these two thresholds,\npotentiation/depression occurs when the local field is above/below an\nintermediate threshold. We simulated and analyzed a network of binary neurons\nimplementing this rule and measured its storage capacity for different sizes of\nthe basins of attraction. The storage capacity obtained through numerical\nsimulations is shown to be close to the value predicted by analytical\ncalculations. We also measured the dependence of capacity on the strength of\nexternal inputs. Finally, we quantified the statistics of the resulting\nsynaptic connectivity matrix, and found that both the fraction of zero weight\nsynapses and the degree of symmetry of the weight matrix increase with the\nnumber of stored patterns.\n", "  We develop a new method for decomposing Witten diagrams into conformal\nblocks. The steps involved are elementary, requiring no explicit integration,\nand operate directly in position space. Central to this construction is an\nappealingly simple answer to the question: what object in AdS computes a\nconformal block? The answer is a \"geodesic Witten diagram,\" which is\nessentially an ordinary exchange Witten diagram, except that the cubic vertices\nare not integrated over all of AdS, but only over bulk geodesics connecting the\nboundary operators. In particular, we consider the case of four-point functions\nof scalar operators, and show how to easily reproduce existing results for the\nrelevant conformal blocks in arbitrary dimension.\n", "  Estimating mutual information (MI) from samples is a fundamental problem in\nstatistics, machine learning, and data analysis. Recently it was shown that a\npopular class of non-parametric MI estimators perform very poorly for strongly\ndependent variables and have sample complexity that scales exponentially with\nthe true MI. This undesired behavior was attributed to the reliance of those\nestimators on local uniformity of the underlying (and unknown) probability\ndensity function. Here we present a novel semi-parametric estimator of mutual\ninformation, where at each sample point, densities are {\\em locally}\napproximated by a Gaussians distribution. We demonstrate that the estimator is\nasymptotically unbiased. We also show that the proposed estimator has a\nsuperior performance compared to several baselines, and is able to accurately\nmeasure relationship strengths over many orders of magnitude.\n", "  We present a comprehensive numerical analysis of a four-dimensional model\nwith the Higgs as a composite pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson that features a\ncalculable Higgs potential and protective custodial and flavour symmetries to\nreduce electroweak fine-tuning. We employ a novel numerical technique that\nallows us for the first time to study constraints from radiative electroweak\nsymmetry breaking, Higgs physics, electroweak precision tests, flavour physics,\nand direct LHC bounds on fermion and vector boson resonances in a single\nframework. We consider four different flavour symmetries in the composite\nsector, one of which we show to not be viable anymore in view of strong\nprecision constraints. In the other cases, all constraints can be passed with a\nsub-percent electroweak fine-tuning. The models can explain the excesses\nrecently observed in $WW$, $WZ$, $Wh$ and $\\ell^+\\ell^-$ resonance searches by\nATLAS and CMS and the anomalies in angular observables and branching ratios of\nrare semi-leptonic $B$ decays observed by LHCb. Solving the $B$ physics\nanomalies predicts the presence of a dijet or $t\\bar t$ resonance around 1 TeV\njust below the sensitivity of LHC run 1. We discuss the prospects to probe the\nmodels at run 2 of the LHC. As a side product, we identify several gaps in the\nsearches for vector-like quarks at hadron colliders, that could be closed by\nreanalyzing existing LHC data.\n", "  We present optical and near-infrared light curves and optical spectra of SN\n2013dx, associated with the nearby (redshift 0.145) gamma-ray burst GRB\n130702A. The prompt isotropic gamma-ray energy released from GRB 130702A is\nmeasured to be $E_{\\gamma,iso}=6.4_{-1.0}^{+1.3}\\times10^{50}$erg (1keV-10MeV\nin the rest frame), placing it intermediate between low-luminosity GRBs like\nGRB 980425/SN 1998bw and the broader cosmological population. We compare the\nobserved $g'r'i'z'$ light curves of SN 2013dx to a SN 1998bw template, finding\nthat SN 2013dx evolves ~20% faster (steeper rise time), with a comparable peak\nluminosity. Spectroscopically, SN 2013dx resembles other broad-lined Type Ic\nsupernovae, both associated with (SN 2006aj and SN 1998bw) and lacking (SN\n1997ef, SN 2007I, and SN 2010ah) gamma-ray emission, with photospheric\nvelocities around peak of ~21,000km s$^{-1}$. We construct a quasi-bolometric\n($g'r'i'z'yJ$) light curve for SN 2013dx, only the fifth GRB-associated SN with\nextensive NIR coverage and the third with a bolometric light curve extending\nbeyond $\\Delta t>40$d. Together with the measured photospheric velocity, we\nderive basic explosion parameters using simple analytic models. We infer a\n$^{56}$Ni mass of $M_{\\mathrm{Ni}}=0.37\\pm0.01$M$_{\\odot}$, an ejecta mass of\n$M_{\\mathrm{ej}}=3.1\\pm0.1$M$_{\\odot}$, and a kinetic energy of\n$E_{\\mathrm{K}}=(8.2\\pm0.43)\\times10^{51}$ erg (statistical uncertainties\nonly), consistent with previous GRB-associated SNe. When considering the\nensemble population of GRB-associated SNe, we find no correlation between the\nmass of synthesized $^{56}$Ni and high-energy properties, despite clear\npredictions from numerical simulations that $M_{\\mathrm{Ni}}$ should correlate\nwith the degree of asymmetry. On the other hand, $M_{\\mathrm{Ni}}$ clearly\ncorrelates with the kinetic energy of the supernova ejecta across a wide range\nof core-collapse events.\n", "  We discuss the effects of open boundary conditions and boundary induced drift\non condensation phenomena in the pair-factorized steady states transport\nprocess, a versatile model for stochastic transport with tunable\nnearest-neighbour interactions. Varying the specific type of the boundary\nimplementation as well as the presence of a particle drift, we observe phase\ndiagrams that are similar but richer compared to those of the simpler\nzero-range process with open boundary conditions. Tuning our model towards\nzero-range-process-like properties we are able to study boundary induced\neffects in the transition regime from zero-range interactions to short-range\ninteractions. We discuss the emerging phase structure where spatially extended\ncondensates can be observed at the boundaries as well as in the bulk system and\ncompare it to the situation with periodic boundaries, where the dynamics leads\nto the formation of a single condensate in the bulk.\n", "  We study the effects of Majorana modes and interactions between electrons on\ntransport in a one-dimensional system with a junction of three p-wave\nsuperconductors (SCs) which are connected to normal metal leads. For\nsufficiently long SCs, there are zero energy Majorana modes at the junctions\nbetween the SCs and the leads,and, depending on the signs of the p-wave\npairings in the three SCs, there can also be one or three Majorana modes at the\njunction of the three SCs. We show that the various sub-gap conductances have\npeaks occurring at the energies of all these modes; we therefore get a rich\npattern of conductance peaks. Next, we use a renormalization group approach to\nstudy the scattering matrix of the system at energies far from the SC gap. The\nfixed points of the renormalization group flows and their stabilities are\nstudied; we find that the scattering matrix at the stable fixed point is highly\nsymmetric even when the microscopic scattering matrix and the interaction\nstrengths are not symmetric. We discuss the implications of this for the\nconductances. Finally we propose an experimental realization of this system\nwhich can produce different signs of the p-wave pairings in the different SCs.\n", "  In the form of a dialogue (imitating in style Lakatos's Proof and\nRefutation), this chapter presents and explains the main points of the approach\nto contextuality dubbed Contextuality-by-Default.\n", "  It is a possibility that the superworld (supersymmetric partners of our\nworld) does exist without supersymmetry. The two worlds are being distinguished\nby an unbroken discrete $Z_2$ symmetry (similar to R-parity in supersymmetry).\nWe lose the solution to the hierarchy problem. However, such a scenario has\nseveral motivations. For example, the lightest neutral superworld particle will\nbe a candidate for dark matter. The other being, as in supersymmetry, it is\npossible to achieve gauge coupling unification. One major difference with the\nsupersymmetric theory is that such a theory is much more general since it is\nnot constrained by supersymmetry. For example, some of the gauge couplings\nconnecting the Standard Model particles with the superpartners now become free\nYukawa couplings. As a result, the final state signals as well as the limits on\nthe superworld particles can be modified both qualitatively and quantitatively.\nThe reach for these superworld particles at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) can\nbe much higher than the superpartners, leading to the increased possibility of\ndiscovering new physics at the LHC.\n", "  The irradiation with fast ions with kinetic energies of > 10 MeV leads to the\ndeposition of a high amount of energy along their trajectory (up to several ten\nkeV/nm). The energy is mainly transferred to the electronic subsystem and\ninduces different secondary processes of excitations which result in\nsignificant material modifications. A new setup to study these ion induced\neffects on surfaces will be described in this paper. The setup combines a\nvariable irradiation chamber with different techniques of surface\ncharacterizations like scanning probe microscopy, time-of-flight secondary ion\nand neutral mass spectrometry, as well as low energy electron diffraction under\nultra high vacuum conditions, and is mounted at a beamline of the universal\nlinear accelerator (UNILAC) of the GSI facility in Darmstadt, Germany. Here,\nsamples can be irradiated with high-energy ions with a total kinetic energy up\nto several GeVs under different angles of incidence. Our setup enables the\npreparation and in-situ analysis of different types of sample systems ranging\nfrom metals to insulators. Time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry\nenables us to study the chemical composition of the surface, while scanning\nprobe microscopy allows a detailed view into the local electrical and\nmorphological conditions of the sample surface down to atomic scales. With the\nnew setup particle emission during irradiation as well as persistent\nmodifications of the surface after irradiation can thus be studied. We present\nfirst data obtained with the new setup, including a novel measuring protocol\nfor time-of-flight mass spectrometry with the GSI UNILAC accelerator.\n", "  A new realization for radiative neutrino mass generation is presented. Based\non the requirement of tree-level custodial symmetry and the introduction of\nhigher (greater than two) dimensional representations for scalar fields, a\nspecific scenario with a scalar septet is presented that generates neutrino\nMajorana masses radiatively. This is accomplished through an eleven dimensional\noperator that requires the addition of several scalar fields and a SU(2) 5-plet\nof new fermions, together with a Z2 that guarantees the preservation of\ncustodial symmetry. The phenomenology of the setup is rather rich and includes\na dark matter candidate\n", "  We review the recent developments in electronic Raman scattering measurements\nof charge nematic fluctuations in iron-based superconductors. A simple\ntheoretical framework of a $d$-wave Pomeranchuk transition is proposed in order\nto capture the salient features of the spectra. We discuss the available Raman\ndata in the normal state of 122 iron-based systems, particularly Co doped\nBaFe$_2$As$_2$, and we show that the low energy quasi-elastic peak, the\nextracted nematic susceptibility and the scattering rates are consistent with\nan electronic driven structural phase transition. In the superconducting state\nwith a full gap the quasi-elastic peak transforms into a finite frequency\nnematic resonance, evidences for which are particularly strong in the electron\ndoped systems. A crucial feature of the analysis is the fact that the\nelectronic Raman signal is unaffected by the acoustic phonons. This makes Raman\nspectroscopy a unique probe of electronic nematicity.\n", "  Quantum entanglement shared between more than two particles is essential to\nfoundational questions in quantum mechanics, and upcoming quantum information\ntechnologies. So far, up to 14 two-dimensional qubits have been entangled, and\nan open question remains if one can also demonstrate entanglement of\nhigher-dimensional discrete properties of more than two particles. A promising\nroute is the use of the photon orbital angular momentum (OAM), which enables\nimplementation of novel quantum information protocols, and the study of\nfundamentally new quantum states. To date, only two of such multidimensional\nparticles have been entangled albeit with ever increasing dimensionality. Here\nwe use pulsed spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC) to produce photon\nquadruplets that are entangled in their OAM, or transverse-mode degrees of\nfreedom; and witness genuine multipartite Dicke-type entanglement. Apart from\naddressing foundational questions, this could find applications in quantum\nmetrology, imaging, and secret sharing.\n", "  As the Higgs boson properties settle, the constraints on the Standard Model\nextensions tighten. We consider all possible new fermions that can couple to\nthe Higgs, inspecting sets of up to four chiral multiplets. We confront them\nwith direct collider searches, electroweak precision tests, and current\nknowledge of the Higgs couplings. The focus is on scenarios that may depart\nfrom the decoupling limit of very large masses and vanishing mixing, as they\noffer the best prospects for detection. We identify exotic chiral families that\nmay receive a mass from the Higgs only, still in agreement with the\n$h\\gamma\\gamma$ signal strength. A mixing $\\theta$ between the Standard Model\nand non-chiral fermions induces order $\\theta^2$ deviations in the Higgs\ncouplings. The mixing can be as large as $\\theta\\sim 0.5$ in case of custodial\nprotection of the $Z$ couplings or accidental cancellation in the oblique\nparameters. We also notice some intriguing effects for much smaller values of\n$\\theta$, especially in the lepton sector. Our survey includes a number of\nunconventional pairs of vector-like and Majorana fermions coupled through the\nHiggs, that may induce order one corrections to the Higgs radiative couplings.\nWe single out the regions of parameters where $h\\gamma\\gamma$ and $hgg$ are\nunaffected, while the $h\\gamma Z$ signal strength is significantly modified,\nturning a few times larger than in the Standard Model in two cases. The second\nrun of the LHC will effectively test most of these scenarios.\n", "  The Einstein-Maxwell (E-M) equations in a curved spacetime that admits at\nleast one Killing vector are derived, from a Lagrangian density adapted to\nsymmetries. In this context, an auxiliary space of potentials is introduced, in\nwhich, the set of potentials associated to an original (seed) solution of the\nE-M equations are transformed to a new set, either by continuous\ntransformations or by discrete transformations. In this article, continuous\ntransformations are considered. Accordingly, originating from the so-called\n$\\gamma_A$-metric, other exact solutions to the E-M equations are recovered and\ndiscussed.\n", "  In this paper the amorphous/solid to disorder liquid structural phase\ntransitions of an anomalous confined fluid is analyzed using their local\nfractal dimension. The model is a system of particles interacting through a two\nlength scales potentials confined by two infinite plates. In the bulk, this\nfluid exhibit water-like anomalies and under confinement forms layers of\nparticles. The particle distributions of them, present different arrangements\nrelated to amorphous/solid phases. Here only the contact layer is analyzed\nthrough fractal singularity spectrum. At high densities the structural\ntransition its quantify by the order degree to determine the phases affected by\nthe confinement. This mapping shows that the system as the temperature\nincreased, the fractal dimension decreases, which is consistent with the\nbehavior studying in such systems. This result suggests that under\nthermodynamic perturbations, an anomalous confined liquid, presents different\nphase transitions achieving be characterized by its fractality.\n", "  In 1963, Lieb and Liniger solved exactly a one dimensional model of bosons\ninteracting by a repulsive \\delta-potential and calculated the ground state in\nthe thermodynamic limit. In the present work, we extend this model to a\npotential of three \\delta-functions, one of them is repulsive and the other two\nare attractive, modeling some aspects of the interaction between atoms, and\npresent an approximate solution for a dilute gas. In this limit, for low energy\nstates, the results are found to be reduced to the ones of an effective Lieb\nLiniger model with an effective \\delta-function of strength $c_{eff}$ and the\nregime of stability is identified. This may shed light on some aspects of\ninteracting bosons.\n", "  Ongoing and future wide-field galaxy surveys can be used to locate a number\nof clusters of galaxies with cosmic shear measurement alone. We study\nconstraints on cosmological models using statistics of weak lensing selected\ngalaxy clusters. We extend our previous theoretical framework to model the\nstatistical properties of clusters in variants of cosmological models as well\nas in the standard $\\Lambda$CDM model. Weak lensing selection of clusters does\nnot rely on the conventional assumption such as the relation between luminosity\nand mass and/or hydrostatic equilibrium, but a number of observational effects\ncompromise robust identification. We use a large set of realistic mock\nweak-lensing catalogs as well as analytic models to perform a Fisher analysis\nand make forecast for constraining two competing cosmological models, $w$CDM\nmodel and $f(R)$ model proposed by Hu & Sawicki, with our lensing statistics.\nWe show that weak lensing selected clusters are excellent probe of cosmology\nwhen combined with cosmic shear power spectrum even in presence of galaxy shape\nnoise and masked regions. With the information of weak lensing selected\nclusters, the precision of cosmological parameter estimate can be improved by a\nfactor of $\\sim1.6$ and $\\sim8$ for $w$CDM model and $f(R)$ model,\nrespectively. Hyper Suprime-Cam survey with sky coverage of $1250$ squared\ndegrees can constrain the equation of state of dark energy $w_{0}$ with a level\nof $\\Delta w_0 \\sim0.1$. It can also constrain the additional scalar degree of\nfreedom in $f(R)$ model with a level of $|f_{R0}| \\sim5\\times10^{-6}$, when\nconstraints from cosmic microwave background measurements are incorporated.\nFuture weak lensing surveys with sky coverage of $20,000$ squared degrees will\nplace tighter constraints on $w_{0}$ and $|f_{R0}|$ even without cosmic\nmicrowave background measurements.\n", "  We propose a new electromagnetic-emission mechanism in magnetized, force-free\nplasma, which is driven by the evolution of the underlying dynamic spacetime.\nIn particular, the emission power and angular distribution of the emitted\nfast-magnetosonic and Alfv\\'en waves are separately determined. Previous\nnumerical simulations of binary black hole mergers occurring within magnetized\nplasma have recorded copious amounts of electromagnetic radiation that, in\naddition to collimated jets, include an unexplained, isotropic component which\nbecomes dominant close to merger. This raises the possibility of multimessenger\ngravitational-wave and electromagnetic observations on binary black hole\nsystems. The mechanism proposed here provides a candidate analytical\ncharacterization of the numerical results, and when combined with previously\nunderstood mechanisms such as the Blandford-Znajek process and\nkinetic-motion-driven radiation, allows us to construct a classification of\ndifferent electromagnetic radiation components seen in the inspiral stage of\ncompact-binary coalescences.\n", "  The classical and quantum solutions of a nonlinear model describing harmonic\noscillators on the sphere and the hyperbolic plane, derived in polar\ncoordinates in a recent paper [Phys.\\ Lett.\\ A 379 (2015) 1589], are extended\nby the inclusion of an isotonic term.\n", "  The Dark Energy Survey (DES) is a 5000 sq. degree survey in the southern\nhemisphere, which is rapidly reducing the existing north-south asymmetry in the\ncensus of MW satellites and other stellar substructure. We use the first-year\nDES data down to previously unprobed photometric depths to search for stellar\nsystems in the Galactic halo, therefore complementing the previous analysis of\nthe same data carried out by our group earlier this year. Our search is based\non a matched filter algorithm that produces stellar density maps consistent\nwith stellar population models of various ages, metallicities, and distances\nover the survey area. The most conspicuous density peaks in these maps have\nbeen identified automatically and ranked according to their significance and\nrecurrence for different input models. We report the discovery of one\nadditional stellar system besides those previously found by several authors\nusing the same first-year DES data. The object is compact, and consistent with\nbeing dominated by an old and metal-poor population. DES J0034-4902 is found at\nhigh significance and appears in the DES images as a compact concentration of\nfaint blue point sources at ~ 87 {kpc}. Its half-light radius of r_h = 9.88 +/-\n4.31 {pc} and total luminosity of M_V ~ -3.05_{-0.42}^{+0.69} are consistent\nwith it being a low mass halo cluster. It is also found to have a very\nelongated shape. In addition, our deeper probe of DES 1st year data confirms\nthe recently reported satellite galaxy candidate Horologium II as a significant\nstellar overdensity. We also infer its structural properties and compare them\nto those reported in the literature.\n", "  In this paper a new procedure to smooth out the initial energy densities of\nhydrodynamics is employed to show that the initial spatial eccentricities\n$\\varepsilon_{m,n}$, which drive the final state flow harmonics $v_n$, are\nremarkably robust with respect to variations of the underlying scale of initial\nenergy density spatial gradients, $\\lambda$, in nucleus-nucleus collisions. For\n$\\sqrt{s}=2.76$ TeV Pb+Pb collisions, the $\\varepsilon_{m,n}$'s (across\ncentrality classes) change by less than $10\\%$ if the scale of fluctuations is\nvaried from $0.1$ to $1$ fm. We show, using the 2+1 Lagrangian hydrodynamic\ncode, v-USPhydro, that this robustness is transferred to the final $v_n$'s\ncomputed within event by event viscous hydrodynamics. This indicates that the\nflow harmonics in nucleus-nucleus collisions are not yet particularly sensitive\nto the underlying microscopic sub-nucleon physics below the confinement scale.\nOn the other hand, the eccentricities of top $1\\%$ high multiplicity\n$\\sqrt{s}=5.02$ TeV p+Pb collisions are found to be very sensitive to\nsub-nucleonic scale fluctuations, which should be contrasted with the\nrobustness found in peripheral Pb+Pb collisions with the same multiplicity.\n", "  {In this paper we propose a new impact-parameter dependent CGC/saturation\nmodel. We introduce two new features in the model that make it consistent with\nwhat we know theoretically about the deep inelastic scattering. They are: the\nuse of the exact form of the solution to the non-linear (BK) equation, whereas\nin all previous attempts only the form of $r^2Q^2_s$ dependence, has been taken\ninto account; and the large impact parameter dependence, through the\n$b$-dependence of the saturation momentum which reproduce the correct behaviour\nof the amplitude at large impact parameters $b$ ($A \\propto \\exp\\Lb - \\mu\nb\\Rb$) as well as at large momentum transferred $Q_T$ ($A $ decreases as a\npower of $Q_T$ as it follows from perturbative QCD). These improvement compared\nto all previous attempts to build such models, allows us to claim, that the\nexperimental data are in accord with the prediction of CGC/saturation approach\nwhile previously, based on similar models, we could only conclude that the DIS\ndata, perhaps, can be described by introducing the shadowing corrections at\nsmall photon virtualities.\n", "  We work out all of the details required for implementation of the conformal\nbootstrap program applied to the four-point function of two scalars and two\nvectors in an abstract conformal field theory in arbitrary dimension. This\nincludes a review of which tensor structures make appearances, a construction\nof the projectors onto the required mixed symmetry representations, and a\ncomputation of the conformal blocks for all possible operators which can be\nexchanged. These blocks are presented as differential operators acting upon the\npreviously known scalar conformal blocks. Finally, we set up the bootstrap\nequations which implement crossing symmetry. Special attention is given to the\ncase of conserved vectors, where several simplifications occur.\n", "  The speed of magnetization reversal is a key feature in magnetic data\nstorage. Magnetic fields from intense THz pulses have been recently shown to\ninduce small magnetization dynamics in Cobalt thin film on the sub-picosecond\ntime scale. Here, we show that at higher field intensities, the THz electric\nfield starts playing a role, strongly changing the dielectric properties of the\ncobalt thin film. Both the electronic and magnetic responses are found to occur\nsimultaneously, with the electric field response persistent on a time scale\norders of magnitude longer than the THz stimulus\n", "  The point group symmetry of materials is closely related to their physical\nproperties and quite important for material modeling. However, superlattice\nmaterials have more complex symmetry conditions than crystals due to their\nmultilevel structural feature. Thus, a theoretical framework is proposed to\ncharacterize and determine the point group symmetry of nonmagnetic superlattice\nmaterials systematically. A variety of examples are presented to show the\nsymmetry features of superlattice materials in different dimensions and scales.\nIn addition, the deformation induced symmetry breaking phenomenon is also\nstudied for superlattice materials, which has potential application in tuning\nphysical properties by imposing a strain field.\n", "  The Two-Micron All-Sky Survey (2MASS) has mapped out the low-redshift\nUniverse down to $K_S\\sim14$ mag. As its near-infrared photometry primarily\nprobes the featureless Rayleigh-Jeans tail of galaxy spectral energy\ndistributions, colour-based redshift estimation is rather uninformative. Until\nnow, redshift estimates for this dataset have relied on optical follow-up\nsuffering from selection biases. Here we use the newly-developed technique of\nclustering-based redshift estimation to infer the redshift distribution of the\n2MASS sources regardless of their optical properties. We characterise redshift\ndistributions of objects from the Extended Source Catalogue as a function of\nnear-infrared colours and brightness and report some observed trends. We also\napply the clustering redshift technique to dropout populations, sources with\nnon-detections in one or more near-infrared bands, and present their redshift\ndistributions. Combining all extended sources, we confirm with clustering\nredshifts that the distribution of this sample extends up to $z\\sim0.35$. % We\nperform a similar analysis with the Point Source Catalogue and show that it can\nbe separated into stellar and extragalactic contributions with galaxies\nreaching $z\\sim0.7$. We estimate that the Point Source Catalogue contains 1.6\nmillion extragalactic objects: as many as in the Extended Source Catalogue but\nprobing a cosmic volume ten times larger.\n", "  First high-altitude observations of gravity wave (GW)-induced CO$_2$ density\nperturbations in the Martian thermosphere retrieved from NASA's NGIMS\ninstrument on board the MAVEN satellite are presented and interpreted using the\nextended GW parameterization of Yi\\u{g}it et al. [2008] and the Mars Climate\nDatabase as an input. Observed relative density perturbations between 180-220\nkm of 20-40 % demonstrate appreciable local time, latitude, and altitude\nvariations. Modeling for the spatiotemporal conditions of the MAVEN\nobservations suggests that GWs can directly propagate from the lower atmosphere\nto the thermosphere, produce appreciable dynamical effects, and likely\ncontribute to the observed fluctuations. Modeled effects are somewhat smaller\nthan the observed but their highly variable nature is in qualitative agreement\nwith observations. Possible reasons for discrepancies between modeling and\nmeasurements are discussed.\n", "  We present two supernovae (SNe) discovered with the Hubble Space Telescope\n(HST) in the Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey\n(CANDELS), an HST multi-cycle treasury program. We classify both objects as\nType Ia SNe and find redshifts of z = 1.80+-0.02 and 2.26 +0.02 -0.10, the\nlatter of which is the highest redshift Type Ia SN yet seen. Using light curve\nfitting we determine luminosity distances and find that both objects are\nconsistent with a standard Lambda-CDM cosmological model. These SNe were\nobserved using the HST Wide Field Camera 3 infrared detector (WFC3-IR), with\nimaging in both wide- and medium-band filters. We demonstrate that the\nclassification and redshift estimates are significantly improved by the\ninclusion of single-epoch medium-band observations. This medium-band imaging\napproximates a very low resolution spectrum (lambda/delta lambda ~ 100) which\ncan isolate broad spectral absorption features that differentiate Type Ia SNe\nfrom their most common core collapse cousins. This medium-band method is also\ninsensitive to dust extinction and (unlike grism spectroscopy) it is not\naffected by contamination from the SN host galaxy or other nearby sources. As\nsuch, it can provide a more efficient - though less precise - alternative to IR\nspectroscopy for high-z SNe.\n", "  Temporal optical solitons have been the subject of intense research due to\ntheir intriguing physics and applications in ultrafast optics and\nsupercontinuum generation. Conventional bright optical solitons result from the\ninteraction of anomalous group-velocity dispersion and self-phase modulation.\nHere we report the discovery of an entirely new class of bright solitons\narising purely from the interaction of negative fourth-order dispersion and\nself-phase modulation, which can occur even for normal group-velocity\ndispersion. We provide experimental and numerical evidence of shape-preserving\npropagation and flat temporal phase for the fundamental pure-quartic soliton\nand periodically modulated propagation for the higher-order pure-quartic\nsolitons. Using analytic theory, we derive the approximate shape of the\nfundamental pure-quartic soliton exhibiting excellent agreement with our\nexperimental observations. Our discovery, enabled by the unique dispersion of\nphotonic crystal waveguides, could find applications in communications and\nultrafast lasers.\n", "  We investigate the nuclear isotropic shielding constants and spin-spin\ncoupling for oxygen and carbons atoms of isomers of tartaric acid in gas phase\nand water solutions by Monte Carlo simulation and quantum mechanics\ncalculations using the GIAO-B3LYP approach. Solute polarization effects are\nincluded iteratively and play an important role in the quantitative\ndetermination of shielding constants. Our MP2/aug-cc-pVTZ results show\nsubstantial increases of the dipole moment in solution as compared with the gas\nphase results (61-221%). The solvent effects on the {\\sigma}(13C) [J(C-C)]\nvalues are in general small. More appreciable solvent effects can be seen on\nthe {\\sigma}(17O) and J(C-O).\n", "  The charged particle transverse momentum ($p_T$) spectra measured by the\nATLAS and CMS collaborations in proton - proton collisions at sqrt(s) = 0.9 and\n7 TeV have been studied using Tsallis thermodynamics. A thermodynamically\nconsistent form of the Tsallis distribution is used for fitting the transverse\nmomentum spectra at mid-rapidity. It is found that the fits based on the\nproposed distribution provide an excellent description over 14 orders of\nmagnitude with $p_T$ values up to 200 GeV/c.\n", "  We reconsider the one loop divergence of ${\\cal N}=8$ supergravity in four\ndimensions. We compute the finite effective potential of ${\\cal N}=8$\nanti-deSitter supergravity and interpret it as logarithmic running of the\ncosmological constant. We find that quantum inequivalence between fields that\nare classically dual is due to boundary modes in AdS$_4$. Some subtleties are\ntraced to the difference between the Euler characteristic of global and thermal\nAdS$_4$.\n", "  The structure, interdependence, and fragility of systems ranging from power\ngrids and transportation to ecology, climate, biology and even human\ncommunities and the Internet, have been examined through network science. While\nthe response to perturbations has been quantified, recovery strategies for\nperturbed networks have usually been either discussed conceptually or through\nanecdotal case studies. Here we develop a network science-based quantitative\nmethods framework for measuring, comparing and interpreting hazard responses\nand as well as recovery strategies. The framework, motivated by the recently\nproposed temporal resilience paradigm, is demonstrated with the Indian Railways\nNetwork. The methods are demonstrated through the resilience of the network to\nnatural or human-induced hazards and electric grid failure. Simulations\ninspired by the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami and the 2012 North Indian blackout as\nwell as a cyber-physical attack scenario. Multiple metrics are used to generate\nvarious recovery strategies, which are simply sequences in which system\ncomponents should be recovered after a disruption. Quantitative evaluation of\nrecovery strategies suggests that faster and more resource-effective recovery\nis possible through network centrality measures. Case studies based on two\nhistorical events, specifically the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami and the 2012\nNorth Indian blackout, and a simulated cyber-physical attack scenario, provides\nmeans for interpreting the relative performance of various recovery strategies.\nQuantitative evaluation of recovery strategies suggests that faster and more\nresource-effective restoration is possible through network centrality measures,\neven though the specific strategy may be different for sub-networks or for the\npartial recovery.\n", "  The purpose of this paper is to study quasinormal modes (QNM) of a regular\nblack hole with a cosmological constant due to scalar perturbations. A detailed\nstudy of the QNM frequencies for the massless scalar field were done by varying\nthe parameters of the theory such as the mass, magnetic charge, cosmological\nconstant, and the spherical harmonic index. We have employed the sixth order\nWKB approximation to compute the QNM frequencies. We have also proved\nanalytically that the $l=0$ mode for the massless field reach a constant value\nat late times. We have approximated the near-extreme regular-de Sitter black\nhole potential with the P$\\ddot{o}$schl-Teller potential to obtain exact\nfrequencies. The null geodesics of the regular-de Sitter black hole is employed\nto describe the QNM frequencies at the eikonal limit ($ l >>1$).\n", "  We study charm production in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions by using\nthe Parton-Hadron-String Dynamics (PHSD) transport approach. The initial charm\nquarks are produced by the PYTHIA event generator tuned to fit the transverse\nmomentum spectrum and rapidity distribution of charm quarks from Fixed-Order\nNext-to-Leading Logarithm (FONLL) calculations. The produced charm quarks\nscatter in the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) with the off-shell partons whose masses\nand widths are given by the Dynamical Quasi-Particle Model (DQPM), which\nreproduces the lattice QCD equation-of-state in thermal equilibrium. The\nrelevant cross sections are calculated in a consistent way by employing the\neffective propagators and couplings from the DQPM. Close to the critical energy\ndensity of the phase transition, the charm quarks are hadronized into $D$\nmesons through coalescence and/or fragmentation. The hadronized $D$ mesons then\ninteract with the various hadrons in the hadronic phase with cross sections\ncalculated in an effective lagrangian approach with heavy-quark spin symmetry.\nThe nuclear modification factor $R_{AA}$ and the elliptic flow $v_2$ of $D^0$\nmesons from PHSD are compared with the experimental data from the STAR\nCollaboration for Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ =200 GeV and to the ALICE\ndata for Pb+Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ =2.76 TeV. We find that in the\nPHSD the energy loss of $D$ mesons at high $p_T$ can be dominantly attributed\nto partonic scattering while the actual shape of $R_{AA}$ versus $p_T$ reflects\nthe heavy-quark hadronization scenario, i.e. coalescence versus fragmentation.\nAlso the hadronic rescattering is important for the $R_{AA}$ at low $p_T$ and\nenhances the $D$-meson elliptic flow $v_2$.\n", "  The propagation of filaments in the Scrape Off Layer (SOL) of tokamaks\nlargely determine the plasma profiles in the region. In a conduction limited\nSOL, parallel temperature gradients are expected, such that the resistance to\nparallel currents is greater at the target than further upstream. Since the\nperpendicular motion of an isolated filament is largely determined by balance\nof currents that flow through it, this may be expected to affect filament\ntransport. 3D simulations have thus been used to study the influence of\nenhanced parallel resistivity on the dynamics of filaments. Filaments with the\nsmallest perpendicular length scales, which were inertially limited at low\nresistivity (meaning that polarization rather than parallel currents determine\ntheir radial velocities), were unaffected by resistivity. For larger filaments,\nfaster velocities were produced at higher resistivities, due to two mechanisms.\nFirstly parallel currents were reduced and polarization currents were enhanced,\nmeaning that the inertial regime extended to larger filaments, and secondly a\npotential difference formed along the parallel direction so that higher\npotentials were produced in the region of the filament for the same amount of\ncurrent to flow into the sheath. These results indicate that broader SOL\nprofiles could be produced at higher resistivities.\n", "  We consider four-dimensional Higher-Spin Theory at the first nontrivial order\ncorresponding to the cubic action. All Higher-Spin interaction vertices are\nexplicitly obtained from Vasiliev's equations. In particular, we obtain the\nvertices that are not determined solely by the Higher-Spin algebra structure\nconstants. The dictionary between the Fronsdal fields and Higher-Spin\nconnections is found and the corrections to the Fronsdal equations are derived.\nThese corrections turn out to involve derivatives of arbitrary order. We\nobserve that the vertices not determined by the Higher-Spin algebra produce\nnaked infinities, when decomposed into the minimal derivative vertices and\nimprovements. Therefore, standard methods can only be used to check a rather\nlimited number of correlation functions within the HS AdS/CFT duality. A\npossible resolution of the puzzle is discussed.\n", "  The long-range electromagnetic interaction presents a challenge for numerical\ncomputations in QCD + QED. In addition to power-law finite volume effects, the\nstandard lattice gauge theory approach introduces non-locality through removal\nof photon zero-momentum modes. The resulting finite volume effects must be\nquantitatively understood; and, to this end, non-relativistic effective field\ntheories are an efficient tool, especially in the case of composite particles.\nRecently an oddity related to non-locality of the standard lattice approach was\nuncovered by the Budapest-Marseille-Wuppertal collaboration. Explicit\ncontributions from antiparticles appear to be required so that finite volume\nQED results for a point-like fermion can be reproduced in the effective field\ntheory description. We provide transparency for this argument by considering\npoint-like scalars and spinors in finite volume QED using the method of\nregions. For the more germane case of composite particles, we determine that\nantiparticle modes contribute to the finite-volume electromagnetic mass of\ncomposite spinors through terms proportional to the squares of time-like form\nfactors evaluated at threshold. We extend existing finite volume calculations\nto one order higher, which is particularly relevant for the electromagnetic\nmass of light nuclei. Additionally, we verify that the analogous finite volume\ncontributions to the nucleon mass in chiral perturbation theory vanish in\naccordance with locality.\n", "  This Letter reports a measurement of the flux and energy spectrum of electron\nantineutrinos from six 2.9~GW$_{th}$ nuclear reactors with six detectors\ndeployed in two near (effective baselines 512~m and 561~m) and one far\n(1,579~m) underground experimental halls in the Daya Bay experiment. Using 217\ndays of data, 296,721 and 41,589 inverse beta decay (IBD) candidates were\ndetected in the near and far halls, respectively. The measured IBD yield is\n(1.55 $\\pm$ 0.04) $\\times$ 10$^{-18}$~cm$^2$/GW/day or (5.92 $\\pm$ 0.14)\n$\\times$ 10$^{-43}$~cm$^2$/fission. This flux measurement is consistent with\nprevious short-baseline reactor antineutrino experiments and is $0.946\\pm0.022$\n($0.991\\pm0.023$) relative to the flux predicted with the Huber+Mueller\n(ILL+Vogel) fissile antineutrino model. The measured IBD positron energy\nspectrum deviates from both spectral predictions by more than 2$\\sigma$ over\nthe full energy range with a local significance of up to $\\sim$4$\\sigma$\nbetween 4-6 MeV. A reactor antineutrino spectrum of IBD reactions is extracted\nfrom the measured positron energy spectrum for model-independent predictions.\n", "  The observed IR and the spectator UV particles of a regulated, cutoff quantum\nfield theory are entangled by their interactions; hence, the IR sector can be\ndescribed by the help of the density matrix only. The tree-level renormalized\ntrajectory is obtained for a self-interacting scalar field theory, containing\nthe mixed state contributions. One needs a sharp cutoff in the momentum space\nas regulator to realize the true loss of information, caused by massive\nparticles.\n", "  The Hubbard model, which augments independent-electron band theory with a\nsingle parameter to describe electron-electron correlations, is widely regarded\nto be the `standard model' of condensed matter physics. The model has been\nremarkably successful at addressing a range of correlation effects in solids,\nbut beyond one dimension its solution is intractable. Much current research\naims, therefore, at finding appropriate approximations to the Hubbard model\nphase diagram. Here we take the new approach of using ab initio electronic\nstructure methods to design a material whose Hamiltonian is that of the\nsingle-band Hubbard model. Solution of the Hubbard model will then be available\nthrough measurement of the material's properties. After identifying an\nappropriate crystal class and several appropriate chemistries, we use density\nfunctional theory and dynamical mean-field theory to screen for the desired\nelectronic band structure and metal-insulator transition. We then explore the\nmost promising candidates for structural stability and suitability for doping\nand propose specific materials for subsequent synthesis. Finally, we identify a\nregime -- that should manifest in our bespoke material -- in which the\nsingle-band Hubbard model on a triangular lattice exhibits exotic d-wave\nsuperconductivity.\n", "  The Extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS) will conduct\nnovel cosmological observations using the BOSS spectrograph at Apache Point\nObservatory. Observations will be simultaneous with the Time Domain\nSpectroscopic Survey (TDSS) designed for variability studies and the\nSpectroscopic Identification of eROSITA Sources (SPIDERS) program designed for\nstudies of X-ray sources. eBOSS will use four different tracers to measure the\ndistance-redshift relation with baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO). Using more\nthan 250,000 new, spectroscopically confirmed luminous red galaxies at a median\nredshift z=0.72, we project that eBOSS will yield measurements of $d_A(z)$ to\nan accuracy of 1.2% and measurements of H(z) to 2.1% when combined with the\nz>0.6 sample of BOSS galaxies. With ~195,000 new emission line galaxy\nredshifts, we expect BAO measurements of $d_A(z)$ to an accuracy of 3.1% and\nH(z) to 4.7% at an effective redshift of z= 0.87. A sample of more than 500,000\nspectroscopically-confirmed quasars will provide the first BAO distance\nmeasurements over the redshift range 0.9<z<2.2, with expected precision of 2.8%\nand 4.2% on $d_A(z)$ and H(z), respectively. Finally, with 60,000 new quasars\nand re-observation of 60,000 quasars known from BOSS, we will obtain new\nLyman-alpha forest measurements at redshifts z>2.1; these new data will enhance\nthe precision of $d_A(z)$ and H(z) by a factor of 1.44 relative to BOSS.\nFurthermore, eBOSS will provide improved tests of General Relativity on\ncosmological scales through redshift-space distortion measurements, improved\ntests for non-Gaussianity in the primordial density field, and new constraints\non the summed mass of all neutrino species. Here, we provide an overview of the\ncosmological goals, spectroscopic target sample, demonstration of spectral\nquality from early data, and projected cosmological constraints from eBOSS.\n", "  The dodecagonal quasicrystal classified into the five-dimensional space group\nP126/mmc, recently discovered in a Mn-Cr-Ni-Si alloy, has been analyzed using\natomic-resolution spherical aberration-corrected electron microscopy, i.e.\nhigh-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy\n(HAADF-STEM) and conventional transmission electron microscopy. By observing\nalong the 12-fold axis, non-periodic tiling consisting of an equilateral\ntriangle and a square has been revealed, of which common edge length is a =\n4.560 A. These tiles tend to form a network of dodecagons of which size is\n(2+Sqrt(3))a ~ 17 A in diameter. The tiling was interpreted as an aggregate of\n100 A-scale oriented domains of high- and low-quality quasicrystals with small\ncrystallites appearing at their boundaries. The quasicrystal domains exhibited\na densely-filled circular acceptance region in the phason space. This is the\nfirst observation of the acceptance region in an actual dodecagonal\nquasicrystal.\n  Atomic structure model consistent with the electron microscopy images is a\nstandard Frank-Kasper decoration of the triangle and square tiles, that can be\ninferred from the crystal structures of Zr4Al3 and Cr3Si. Four kinds of layers\nlocated at z = 0, +-1/4 and 1/2 are stacked periodically along the 12-fold\naxis, and the atoms at z = 0 and 1/2 form hexagonal anti-prisms consistently\nwith the 126-screw axis. The validity of this structure model was examined by\nmeans of powder X-ray diffraction.\n", "  We study the equations for the evolution of cosmological perturbations in\n$f\\left(\\mathcal{R}\\right)$ and conclude that this modified gravity model can\nbe expressed as a dark energy fluid at background and linearised perturbation\norder. By eliminating the extra scalar degree of freedom known to be present in\nsuch theories, we are able to characterise the evolution of the perturbations\nin the scalar sector in terms of equations of state for the entropy\nperturbation and anisotropic stress which are written in terms of the density\nand velocity perturbations of the dark energy fluid and those in the matter, or\nthe metric perturbations. We also do the same in the much simpler vector and\ntensor sectors. In order to illustrate the simplicity of this formulation, we\nnumerically evolve perturbations in a small number of cases.\n", "  The non-classical nature of quantum states, often illustrated using\nentanglement measures or quantum discord, constitutes a resource for quantum\ninformation protocols. However, the non-classicality of a quantum system cannot\nbe encapsulated as a property of the state alone, as the set of available\nmeasurements used to extract information on the system is typically restricted.\nIn this work we study how the non-classicality of quantum measurements,\nquantified via their incompatibility, is influenced by quantum noise and,\nfurther, how a non-Markovian environment may help us in maintaining the\nmeasurement resources.\n", "  The newly established luminosity functions of high-z galaxies at $4 \\lesssim\nz \\lesssim 10$ can provide a stringent check on dark matter models that aim to\nexplain the core properties of dwarf galaxies. The cores of dwarf spheroidal\ngalaxies are understood to be too large to be accounted for by free streaming\nof warm dark matter without overly suppressing the formation of such galaxies.\nHere we demonstrate with cosmological simulations that wave dark matter,\n$\\psi$DM, appropriate for light bosons such as axions, does not suffer this\nproblem, given a boson mass of $m_{\\psi} \\ge 1.2 \\times 10^{-22}{\\,\\rm eV}$\n($2\\sigma$). In this case, the halo mass function is suppressed below $\\sim\n10^{10}{\\,M_\\odot}$ at a level that is consistent with the high-z luminosity\nfunctions, while simultaneously generating the kpc-scale cores in dwarf\ngalaxies arising from the solitonic ground state in $\\psi$DM. We demonstrate\nthat the reionization history in this scenario is consistent with the Thomson\noptical depth recently reported by Planck, assuming a reasonable ionizing\nphoton production rate. We predict that the luminosity function should turn\nover slowly around an intrinsic UV luminosity of $M_{\\rm UV} \\gtrsim -16$ at $z\n\\gtrsim 4$. We also show that for galaxies magnified $\\mathord{>}10\\times$ in\nthe Hubble Frontier Fields, $\\psi$DM predicts an order of magnitude fewer\ndetections than cold dark matter at $z \\gtrsim 10$ down to $M_{\\rm UV} \\sim\n-15$, allowing us to distinguish between these very different interpretations\nfor the observed coldness of dark matter.\n", "  The density in the core of neutron stars can reach values of about 5 to 10\ntimes nuclear matter saturation density. It is, therefore, a natural assumption\nthat hadrons may have dissolved into quarks under such conditions, forming a\nhybrid star. This star will have an outer region of hadronic matter and a core\nof quark matter or even a mixed state of hadrons and quarks. In order to\ninvestigate such phases, we discuss different model approaches that can be used\nin the study of compact stars as well as being applicable to a wider range of\ntemperatures and densities. One major model ingredient, the role of quark\ninteractions in the stability of massive hybrid stars is discussed. In this\ncontext, possible conflicts with lattice QCD simulations are investigated.\n", "  We explore energy transfer in a generic three-level system, which is coupled\nto three non-equilibrium baths. Built on the concept of quantum heat engine,\nour three-level model describes non-equilibrium quantum processes including\nlight-harvesting energy transfer, nano-scale heat transfer, photo-induced\nisomerization, and photovoltaics in double quantum-dots. In the context of\nlight-harvesting, the excitation energy is first pumped up by sunlight, then is\ntransferred via two excited states which are coupled to a phonon bath, and\nfinally decays to the ground state. The efficiency of this process is evaluated\nby steady state analysis via a polaron-transformed master equation; thus a wide\nrange of the system-phonon coupling strength can be covered. We show that the\ncoupling with the phonon bath not only modifies the steady state, resulting in\npopulation inversion, but also introduces a finite steady state coherence which\noptimizes the energy transfer flux and efficiency. In the strong coupling\nlimit, the steady state coherence disappears and the efficiency approaches the\nheat engine limit given by Scovil and Schultz-Dubois in Phys. Rew. Lett. 2, 262\n(1959).\n", "  Recent experiments on certain Fe-based superconductors have hinted at a role\nfor paired electrons in \"incipient\" bands that are close to, but do not cross\nthe Fermi level. Related theoretical works disagree on whether or not\nstrong-coupling superconductivity is required to explain such effects, and\nwhether a critical interaction strength exists. In this work, we consider\nvarious versions of the model problem of pairing of electrons in the presence\nof an incipient band, within a simple multiband weak-coupling BCS\napproximation. We categorize the problem into two cases: case(I) where\nsuperconductivity arises from the \"incipient band pairing\" alone, and case(II)\nwhere it is induced on an incipient band by pairing due to Fermi-surface based\ninteractions. Negative conclusions regarding the importance of incipient bands\nhave been drawn so far largely based on case(I), but we show explicitly that\nmodels under case(II) are qualitatively different, and can explain the\nnon-exponential suppression of Tc, as well as robust large gaps on an incipient\nband. In the latter situation, large gaps on the incipient band do not require\na critical interaction strength. We also model the interplay between phonon and\nspin fluctuation driven superconductivity and describe the bootstrap of\nelectron-phonon superconductivity by spin fluctuations coupling the incipient\nand the regular bands. Finally, we discuss the effect of the dimensionality of\nthe incipient band on our results. We argue that pairing on incipient bands may\nbe significant and important in several Fe-based materials, including LiFeAs,\nFeSe intercalates and FeSe monolayers on strontium titanate, and indeed may\ncontribute to high critical temperatures in some cases.\n", "  We present a numerical study on the minimum reflection channel in a\ndisordered waveguide and its modification by coherent amplification of light.\nThe minimum reflection channel is formed by destructive interference of\nquasi-normal modes at the front surface of the random medium. While the lowest\nreflection eigenvalue increases with gain in most random realizations, the\nminimum reflection channel can adjust its modal composition to enhance the\ndestructive interference and slow down the growth of reflectance with gain.\nSome of the random realizations display a further reduction of the minimum\nreflectance by adding optical gain. The differential amplification of the modes\ncan make their destructive interference so effective that it dominates over the\namplitude growth of the modes, causing the reflectance to drop with gain.\nTherefore, the interplay between interference and amplification makes it\npossible to further minimize light reflection from a strong scattering medium\nby introducing optical gain.\n", "  Polarization-sensitive devices rely on meta-materials to exhibit varying\ndegrees of absorption of light of a given handedness. The chiral surface states\nof a topological insulator(TI) selectively absorb right and left circularly\npolarized light in the vicinity of the Dirac cone reaching its maximum of unity\nat the $ \\Gamma $ point. In this letter, we demonstrate that a band gap open TI\nwith C$_{2v}$ symmetry which is represented through a combination of Rashba and\nDresselhaus Hamiltonians alters the preferential absorption of left and right\ncircularly polarized light allowing a smooth variation of the circular\ndichroism(CD). This variation in CD, reflected in a range of positive and\nnegative values is shown to be a function of the Rashba and Dresselhaus\ncoupling parameters. Additionally, we draw a parallel between the varying CD\nand the emerging field of valley-electronics in transition metal\ndichalcogenides and note the possibility of the chiral states as a basis toward\nquantum information processing.\n", "  The unprecedentedly bright afterglow of Swift GRB 130606A at z = 5.91 gave us\na unique opportunity to probe the reionization era by high precision analyses\nof the redward damping wing of Ly alpha absorption, but the reported\nconstraints on the neutral hydrogen fraction (f_HI) in intergalactic medium\n(IGM) derived from spectra taken by different telescopes are in contradiction.\nHere we examine the origin of this discrepancy by analyzing the spectrum taken\nby VLT with our own analysis code previously used to fit the Subaru spectrum.\nThough the VLT team reported no evidence for IGM HI using the VLT spectrum, we\nconfirmed our previous result of preferring non-zero IGM HI (the best-fit f_HI\n~ 0.06, when IGM HI extends to the GRB redshift). The fit residuals of the VLT\nspectrum by the model without IGM HI show the same systematic trend as the\nSubaru spectrum. We consider that the likely origin of the discrepancy between\nthe two teams is the difference of the wavelength ranges adopted in the\nfittings; our wavelength range is wider than that of the VLT team, and also we\navoided the shortest wavelength range of deep Ly alpha absorption (lambda_obs <\n8426 A), because this region is dominated by HI in the host galaxy and the\nsystematic uncertainty about host HI velocity distribution is large. We also\nstudy the sensitivity of these results to the adopted Ly alpha cross section\nformulae, ranging from the classical Lorentzian function to the most recent one\ntaking into account fully quantum mechanical scattering. It is found that the\npreference for non-zero IGM HI is robust against the choice of the cross\nsection formulae, but it is quantitatively not negligible and hence one should\nbe careful in future analyses.\n", "  A macronova (or kilonova) was observed as an infrared excess several days\nafter short gamma-ray burst, GRB 130603B. Although the $r$-process\nradioactivity is widely discussed as an energy source, it requires huge mass of\nejecta from a neutron star (NS) binary merger. We propose a new model that the\nX-ray excess gives rise to the simultaneously observed infrared excess via\nthermal re-emission and explore what constraints this would place on the mass\nand velocity of the ejecta. This X-ray-powered model explains both the X-ray\nand infrared excesses with a single energy source by the central engine like a\nblack hole, and allows for broader parameter region, in particular smaller\nejecta mass $\\sim10^{-3}-10^{-2}M_{\\odot}$ with iron mixed as suggested by\ngeneral relativistic simulations for typical NS-NS mergers, than the previous\nmodels. We also discuss the other macronova candidates in GRB 060614 and GRB\n080503, and implications for the search of electromagnetic counterparts to\ngravitational waves.\n", "  We develop a kinetic theory for twisted density waves (phonons), carrying a\nfinite amount of orbital angular momentum, in large magneto optical traps,\nwhere the collective processes due to the exchange of scattered photons are\nconsidered. Explicit expressions for the dispersion relation and for the\nkinetic (Landau) damping are derived and contributions from the orbital angular\nmomentum are discussed. We show that for rotating clouds, exhibiting\nring-shaped structures, phonons carrying orbital angular momentum can cross the\ninstability threshold and grow out of noise, while the usual plane wave\nsolutions are kinetically damped.\n", "  We analyze the heat power $P$ between electrons and phonons in thin metallic\nfilms deposited on free-standing dielectric membranes in a temperature range in\nwhich the phonon gas has a quasi two-dimensional distribution. The quantization\nof the electrons wavenumbers in the direction perpendicular to the film\nsurfaces lead to the formation of quasi two-dimensional electronic sub-bands.\nThe electron-phonon coupling is treated in the deformation potential model and,\nif we denote by $T_e$ the electrons temperature and by $T_{ph}$ the phonons\ntemperature, we find that $P\\equiv P^{(0)}(T_{e})-P^{(1)}(T_{e},T_{ph})$;\n$P^{(0)}$ is the power \"emitted\" by the electron system to the phonons and\n$P^{(1)}$ is the power \"absorbed\" by the electrons from the phonons.\n  Due to the quantization of the electronic states, $P$ vs $(d,T_e)$ and $P$ vs\n$(d,T_{ph})$ show very strong oscillations with $d$, forming sharp crests\nalmost parallel to the temperature axes. In the valleys between the crests, $P\n\\propto T_e^{3.5} - T_{ph}^{3.5}$. From valley to crest, $P$ increases by more\nthan one order of magnitude and on the crests $P$ does not have a simple power\nlaw dependence on temperature.\n  The strong modulation of $P$ with the thickness of the film may provide a way\nto control the electron-phonon heat power and the power dissipation in thin\nmetallic films. Eventually the same mechanism may be used to detect small\nvariations of $d$ or surface contamination. On the other hand, the surface\nimperfections of the metallic films may make it difficult to observe the\noscillations of $P$ with $d$ and eventually due to averaging the effects the\nheat flow would have a more smooth dependence on the thickness in real\nexperiments.\n", "  We discuss a class of exact finite energy solutions to the vacuum source-free\nMaxwell field equations as models for multi- and single cycle laser pulses in\nclassical interaction with relativistic charged test particles. These solutions\nare classified in terms of their chiral content based on their influence on\nparticular charge configurations in space. Such solutions offer a\ncomputationally efficient parameterization of compact laser pulses used in\nlaser-matter simulations and provide a potential means for experimentally\nbounding the fundamental length scale in the generalized electrodynamics of\nBopp, Lande and Podolsky.\n", "  Degenerate optomechanical parametric oscillators are optical resonators in\nwhich a mechanical degree of freedom is coupled to a cavity mode that is\nnonlinearly amplified via parametric down-conversion of an external pumping\nlaser. Below a critical pumping power the down-converted field is purely\nquantum-mechanical, making the theoretical description of such systems very\nchallenging. Here we introduce a theoretical approach that is capable of\ndescribing this regime, even at the critical point itself. We find that the\ndown-converted field can induce significant mechanical cooling and identify the\nprocess responsible of this as a cooling-by-heating mechanism. Moreover, we\nshow that, contrary to naive expectations and semi-classical predictions,\ncooling is not optimal at the critical point, where the photon number is\nlargest. Our approach opens the possibility for analyzing further hybrid\ndissipative quantum systems in the vicinity of critical points.\n", "  Many quantum theories of gravity propose Lorentz violating dispersion\nrelations of the form $\\omega = |k|\\, f(|k|/M)$, with recovery of approximate\nLorentz invariance at energy scales much below $M$. We show that a quantum\nfield with this dispersion predicts drastic low energy Lorentz violation in\natoms modelled as Unruh-DeWitt detectors, for any $f$ that dips below unity\nsomewhere. As an example, we show that polymer quantization motivated by loop\nquantum gravity predicts such Lorentz violation below current ion collider\nrapidities.\n", "  The threshold properties of photonic crystal quantum dot lasers operating in\nthe slow-light regime are investigated experimentally and theoretically.\nMeasurements show that, in contrast to conventional lasers, the threshold gain\nattains a minimum value for a specific cavity length. The experimental results\nare explained by an analytical theory for the laser threshold that takes into\naccount the effects of slow-light and random disorder due to unavoidable\nfabrication imperfections. Longer lasers are found to operate deeper into the\nslow-light region, leading to a trade-off between slow-light induced reduction\nof the mirror loss and slow-light enhancement of disorder-induced losses.\n", "  We explore a fluid description of the inflationary universe. In particular,\nwe investigate a fluid model in which the equation of state (EoS) for a fluid\nincludes bulk viscosity. We find that the three observables of inflationary\ncosmology: the spectral index of the curvature perturbations, the\ntensor-to-scalar ratio of the density perturbations, and the running of the\nspectral index, can be consistent with the recent Planck results. We also\nreconstruct the explicit EoS for a fluid from the spectral index of the\ncurvature perturbations compatible with the Planck analysis. In the\nreconstructed models of a fluid, the tensor-to-scalar ratio of the density\nperturbations can satisfy the constraints obtained from the Planck satellite.\nThe running of the spectral index can explain the Planck data. In addition, it\nis demonstrated that in the reconstructed models of a fluid, the graceful exit\nfrom inflation can be realized. Moreover, we show that the singular inflation\ncan occur in a fluid model. Furthermore, we show that a fluid description of\ninflation can be equivalent to the description of inflation in terms of scalar\nfield theories.\n", "  The concept of superlubricity has recently called upon notable interest after\nthe demonstration of ultralow friction between atomistically smooth surfaces in\nlayered materials. However, the energy dissipation process conditioning the\nsustainability of superlubric state has not yet been well understood. In this\nwork, we address this issue by performing dynamic simulations based both on\nfull-atom and reduced Frenkel-Kontorova models. We find that the center-of-mass\nmomentum autocorrelation of a sliding object can be used as an indicator of the\nstate of superlubricity. Beyond a critical value of it, the sliding motion\nexperiences catastrophic breakdown with a dramatically high rate of energy\ndissipation, caused by the inter-vibrational-mode coupling. By tracking this\nwarning signal, one can extract heat from modes other than the translation to\navoid the catastrophe and extend the lifetime of superlubricity. This concept\nis demonstrated in double-walled carbon nanotubes based nanomechanical devices\nwith indicator-based feedback design implemented.\n", "  Advances in mathematical epidemiology have led to a better understanding of\nthe risks posed by epidemic spreading and informed strategies to contain\ndisease spread. However, a challenge that has been overlooked is that, as a\ndisease becomes more prevalent, it can limit the availability of the capital\nneeded to effectively treat those who have fallen ill. Here we use a simple\nmathematical model to gain insight into the dynamics of an epidemic when the\nrecovery of sick individuals depends on the availability of healing resources\nthat are generated by the healthy population. We find that epidemics spiral out\nof control into \"explosive\" spread if the cost of recovery is above a critical\ncost. This can occur even when the disease would die out without the resource\nconstraint. The onset of explosive epidemics is very sudden, exhibiting a\ndiscontinuous transition under very general assumptions. We find analytical\nexpressions for the critical cost and the size of the explosive jump in\ninfection levels in terms of the parameters that characterize the spreading\nprocess. Our model and results apply beyond epidemics to contagion dynamics\nthat self-induce constraints on recovery, thereby amplifying the spreading\nprocess.\n", "  Spectral transfer processes in magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence are\ninvestigated analytically by decomposition of the velocity and magnetic fields\nin Fourier space into helical modes. Steady solutions of the dynamical system\nwhich governs the evolution of the helical modes are determined, and a\nstability analysis of these solutions is carried out. The interpretation of the\nanalysis is that unstable solutions lead to energy transfer between the\ninteracting modes while stable solutions do not. From this, a dependence of\npossible interscale energy and helicity transfers on the helicities of the\ninteracting modes is derived. As expected from the inverse cascade of magnetic\nhelicity in 3D MHD turbulence, mode interactions with like helicities lead to\ntransfer of energy and magnetic helicity to smaller wavenumbers. However, some\ninteractions of modes with unlike helicities also contribute to an inverse\nenergy transfer. As such, an inverse energy cascade for nonhelical magnetic\nfields is shown to be possible. Furthermore, it is found that high values of\nthe cross-helicity may have an asymmetric effect on forward and reverse\ntransfer of energy, where forward transfer is more quenched in regions of high\ncross-helicity than reverse transfer. This conforms with recent observations of\nsolar wind turbulence. For specific helical interactions the relation to dynamo\naction is established.\n", "  We apply the Symanzik improvement programme to the 4+1-dimensional local\nre-formulation of the gradient flow in pure $SU(N)$ lattice gauge theories. We\nshow that the classical nature of the flow equation allows to eliminate all\ncutoff effects at $\\mathcal O(a^2)$ which originate either from the discretized\ngradient flow equation or from the gradient flow observable. All the remaining\n$\\mathcal O(a^2)$ effects can be understood in terms of local counterterms at\nthe zero flow time boundary. We classify these counterterms and provide a\ncomplete set as required for on-shell improvement. Compared to the\n4-dimensional pure gauge theory only a single additional counterterm is\nrequired, which corresponds to a modified initial condition for the flow\nequation. A consistency test in perturbation theory is passed and allows to\ndetermine all counterterm coefficients to lowest non-trivial order in the\ncoupling.\n", "  We have used optical V and R band observations from the Massive Compact Halo\nObject (MACHO) project on a sample of 59 quasars behind the Magellanic clouds\nto study their long term optical flux and colour variations. These quasars\nlying in the redshift range of 0.2 < z < 2.8 and having apparent V band\nmagnitudes between 16.6 and 20.1 mag have observations ranging from 49 to 1353\nepochs spanning over 7.5 years with frequency of sampling between 2 to 10 days.\nAll the quasars show variability during the observing period. The normalized\nexcess variance (Fvar) in V and R bands are in the range 0.2% < Fvar < 1.6% and\n0.1% < Fvar < 1.5%. In a large fraction of the sources, Fvar is larger in the\nV-band compared to the R-band. From the z-transformed discrete cross\ncorrelation function analysis, we find that there is no lag between the V and\nR-band variations. Adopting the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach, and\nproperly taking into account the correlation between the errors in colours and\nmagnitudes, it is found that majority of the sources show a bluer when brighter\ntrend, while a minor fraction of quasars show the opposite behaviour. This is\nsimilar to the results obtained from other two independent algorithms namely\nthe weighted linear least squares fit (FITEXY) and the bivariate correlated\nerrors and intrinsic scatter regression (BCES). However, the ordinary least\nsquares (OLS) fit normally used in the colour variability studies of quasars,\nindicates that all the quasars studied here show a bluer when brighter trend.\nIt is therefore very clear that OLS algorithm cannot be used for the study of\ncolour variability in quasars.\n", "  We provide an interpretation of the recent ATLAS diboson excess in terms of a\nclass of supersymmetric models in which the scale of supersymmetry (SUSY)\nbreaking is in the few TeV range. The particle responsible for the excess is\nthe scalar superpartner of the Goldstone fermion associated with SUSY breaking,\nthe sgoldstino. This scalar couples strongly to the Standard Model vector\nbosons and weakly to the fermions, with all coupling strengths determined by\nratios of soft SUSY breaking parameters over the SUSY breaking scale.\nExplaining the ATLAS excess selects particular relations and ranges for the\ngaugino masses, while imposing no constraints on the other superpartner masses.\nMoreover, this signal hypothesis predicts a rate in the $Z\\gamma$ final state\nthat is expected to be observable at the LHC Run II already with a few\nfb$^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity.\n", "  We analyse here in LO the physical properties of the Green function solution\nfor the BFKL equation. We show that the solution obeys the orthonormality\nconditions in the physical region and fulfills the completeness requirements.\nThe unintegrated gluon density is shown to consists of a set of few poles with\nparameters which could be determined by comparison with the DIS data of high\nprecision.\n", "  Monolayer graphene exhibits many spectacular electronic properties, with\nsuperconductivity being arguably the most notable exception. It was\ntheoretically proposed that superconductivity might be induced by enhancing the\nelectron-phonon coupling through the decoration of graphene with an alkali\nadatom superlattice [Profeta et al. Nat. Phys. 8, 131-134 (2012)]. While\nexperiments have indeed demonstrated an adatom-induced enhancement of the\nelectron-phonon coupling, superconductivity has never been observed. Using\nangle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) we show that lithium\ndeposited on graphene at low temperature strongly modifies the phonon density\nof states, leading to an enhancement of the electron-phonon coupling of up to\n$\\lambda\\!\\simeq\\!0.58$. On part of the graphene-derived $\\pi^*$-band Fermi\nsurface, we then observe the opening of a $\\Delta\\!\\simeq\\!0.9$ meV\ntemperature-dependent pairing gap. This result suggests for the first time, to\nour knowledge, that Li-decorated monolayer graphene is indeed superconducting\nwith $T_c\\!\\simeq\\!5.9 K$.\n", "  It has been proposed that mergers induce starbursts and lead to important\nmorphological changes in galaxies. Most studies so far have focused on large\ngalaxies, but dwarfs might also experience such events, since the halo mass\nfunction is scale-free in the concordance cosmological model. Notably, because\nof their low mass, most of their interactions will be with dark satellites. In\nthis paper we follow the evolution of gas-rich disky dwarf galaxies as they\nexperience a minor merger with a dark satellite. We aim to characterize the\neffects of such an interaction on the dwarf's star formation, morphology, and\nkinematical properties. We performed a suite of carefully set-up hydrodynamical\nsimulations of dwarf galaxies that include dark matter, gas, and stars merging\nwith a satellite consisting solely of dark matter. For the host system we vary\nthe gas fraction, disk size and thickness, halo mass, and concentration, while\nwe explore different masses, concentrations, and orbits for the satellite. We\nfind that the interactions cause strong starbursts of both short and long\nduration in the dwarfs. Their star formation rates increase by factors of a few\nto 10 or more. They are strongest for systems with extended gas disks and high\ngas fractions merging with a high-concentration satellite on a planar, radial\norbit. In contrast to analogous simulations of Milky Way-mass galaxies, many of\nthe systems experience strong morphological changes and become spheroidal even\nin the presence of significant amounts of gas. The simulated systems compare\nremarkably well with the observational properties of a large selection of\nirregular dwarf galaxies and blue compact dwarfs. This implies that mergers\nwith dark satellites might well be happening but not be fully evident, and may\nthus play a role in the diversity of the dwarf galaxy population.\n", "  In this work, we investigated the nonadiabatic transport properties of the\none-dimensional time-dependent superconductor-normal metal-superconductor (SNS)\nJosephson junction biased by a current source and driven by a\nhigh-frequency-ac-gate-potential applied to the normal-metal layer. BCS\nsuperconductors are considered and treated with the time-dependent\nBogoliubov-de Gennes equation. Using Floquet theory, we compute the\ntransmission coefficients and the Wigner-Smith delay times as a function of the\nincident energy and find that they display resonances when one of the electron\nor hole Floquet wavevectors coincides with the bound quasiparticle state within\nthe superconducting energy gap. The resonance varies with the phase difference\nbetween the two superconductors as a result of the bound quasiparticle level\ndisplacement. The supercurrent flowing through the SNS junction is dramatically\nenhanced by the resonances.\n", "  We develop a new pressure representation theorem for nearest-neighbour Gibbs\ninteractions and apply this to obtain the existence of efficient algorithms for\napproximating the pressure in the $2$-dimensional ferromagnetic Potts,\nmulti-type Widom-Rowlinson and hard-core models. For Potts, our results apply\nto every inverse temperature but the critical. For Widom-Rowlinson and\nhard-core, they apply to certain subsets of both the subcritical and\nsupercritical regions. The main novelty of our work is in the latter.\n", "  We present a characterisation of Maurer-Cartan 1-superforms associated to the\ntwo-dimensional supersymmetric $\\mathbb{C}P^{N-1}$ sigma model. We, then, solve\nthe associated linear spectral problem and use its solutions to describe an\nintegrable system for a $su(N)$-valued map.\n", "  A spin-orbit-coupled Bose-Einstein-condensed cloud of atoms confined in an\nannular trapping potential shows a variety of phases that we investigate in the\npresent study. Starting with the non-interacting problem, the homogeneous phase\nthat is present in an untrapped system is replaced by a sinusoidal density\nvariation in the limit of a very narrow annulus. In the case of an untrapped\nsystem there is another phase with a striped-like density distribution, and its\ncounterpart is also found in the limit of a very narrow annulus. As the width\nof the annulus increases, this picture persists qualitatively. Depending on the\nrelative strength between the inter- and the intra-components, interactions\neither favor the striped phase, or suppress it, in which case either a\nhomogeneous, or a sinusoidal-like phase appears. Interactions also give rise to\nnovel solutions with a nonzero circulation.\n", "  The polystyrene dopped with 2,5-diphenyloxazole as a primary fluor and\n2-(4-styrylphenyl)benzoxazole as a wavelength shifter, prepared as a plastic\nscintillator was investigated using positronium probe in wide range of\ntemperatures from 123 to 423 K. Three structural transitions at 260 K, 283 K\nand 370 K were found in the material. In the o-Ps intensity dependence on\ntemperature, the significant hysteresis is observed. Heated to 370 K, the\nmaterial exhibits the o-Ps intensity variations in time.\n", "  Exploiting $B$-meson decays for Standard Model tests and beyond requires a\nprecise understanding of the strong final-state interactions that can be\nprovided model-independently by means of dispersion theory. This formalism\nallows one to deduce the universal pion-pion final-state interactions from the\naccurately known $\\pi\\pi$ phase shifts and, in the scalar sector, a\ncoupled-channel treatment with the kaon-antikaon system. In this work an\nanalysis of the decays $\\bar B_d^0 \\to J/\\psi \\pi^+\\pi^-$ and $\\bar B_s^0 \\to\nJ/\\psi \\pi^+\\pi^-$ is presented. We find very good agreement with the data up\nto 1.05 GeV with a number of parameters reduced significantly compared to a\nphenomenological analysis. In addition, the phases of the amplitudes are\ncorrect by construction, a crucial feature when it comes to studies of $CP$\nviolation in heavy-meson decays.\n", "  We study the heavy quark mass dependence of selected observables constructed\nfrom heavy-light meson correlation functions in small-volume two-flavour\nlattice QCD after taking the continuum limit. The light quark mass is tuned to\nzero, whereas the range of available heavy quark masses $m_h$ covers a region\nextending from around the charm to beyond the bottom quark mass scale. This\nallows entering the asymptotic mass-scaling regime as $1/m_h \\to 0$ and\nperforming well-controlled extrapolations to the infinite-mass limit. Our\nresults are then compared to predictions obtained in the static limit of\ncontinuum Heavy Quark Effective Theory (HQET), in order to verify\nnon-perturbatively that HQET is an effective theory of QCD. While in general we\nobserve a nice agreement at the few-% level, we find it to be less convincing\nfor the small-volume pseudoscalar decay constant when perturbative matching is\ninvolved.\n", "  Resonant second harmonic generation between 1550 nm and 775 nm with outside\nefficiency $> 4.4\\times10^{-4}\\, \\text{mW}^{-1}$ is demonstrated in a gallium\nphosphide microdisk cavity supporting high-$Q$ modes at visible ($Q \\sim 10^4$)\nand infrared ($Q \\sim 10^5$) wavelengths. The double resonance condition was\nsatisfied through intracavity photothermal temperature tuning using $\\sim\n360\\,\\mu$W of 1550 nm light input to a fiber taper and resonantly coupled to\nthe microdisk. Above this pump power efficiency was observed to decrease. The\nobserved behavior is consistent with a simple model for thermal tuning of the\ndouble resonance condition.\n", "  A 1-meter-long trapezoidal Triple-GEM detector with wide readout strips was\ntested in hadron beams at the Fermilab Test Beam Facility in October 2013. The\nreadout strips have a special zigzag geometry and run along the radial\ndirection with an azimuthal pitch of 1.37 mrad to measure the azimuthal\nphi-coordinate of incident particles. The zigzag geometry of the readout\nreduces the required number of electronic channels by a factor of three\ncompared to conventional straight readout strips while preserving good angular\nresolution. The average crosstalk between zigzag strips is measured to be an\nacceptable 5.5%. The detection efficiency of the detector is (98.4+-0.2)%. When\nthe non-linearity of the zigzag-strip response is corrected with track\ninformation, the angular resolution is measured to be (193+-3) urad, which\ncorresponds to 14% of the angular strip pitch. Multiple Coulomb scattering\neffects are fully taken into account in the data analysis with the help of a\nstand-alone Geant4 simulation that estimates interpolated track errors.\n", "  The method of unitary transformations generates five classes of leading-order\nreducible chiral four-nucleon interactions which involve pion-exchanges and a\nspin-spin contact-term. Their first-order contributions to the energy per\nparticle of isospin-symmetric nuclear matter and pure neutron matter are\nevaluated in detail. For most of the closed four-loop diagrams the occurring\nintegrals over four Fermi-spheres can be reduced to easily manageable one- or\ntwo-parameter integrals. One observes substantial cancelations among the\ndifferent contributions arising from 2-ring and 1-ring diagrams. Altogether,\nthe net attraction generated by the chiral four-nucleon interaction does not\nexceed values of $-1.3$\\,MeV for densities $\\rho<2\\rho_0$.\n", "  When light travels through strongly scattering media with optical gain, the\nsynergy between diffusive transport and stimulated emission can lead to lasing\naction. Below the threshold pump power, the emission spectrum is smooth and\nconsistent from shot-to-shot. Above the lasing threshold, the spectrum of\nemitted light becomes spiky and shows strong fluctuations from shot-to-shot.\nRecent experiments have reported that emitted intensity resembles a power-law\ndistribution (\\emph{i.e.} L\\'evy statistics). Recent theories have described\nthe emergence of L\\'evy statistics as an intrinsic property of lasing in random\nmedia. To separate intrinsic intensity fluctuations from the motion of\nscatterers, we compare the statistics of samples with stationary or\nfreely-diffusing scatterers. Consistent with previous reports, we observe\nL\\'evy-like statistics when intensity data are pooled across an ensemble of\nscatterer configurations. For fixed scatterers, we find exponential intensity\ndistributions whose mean intensities vary widely across wavelengths.\nL\\'evy-like statistics re-emerges when data are combined across many lasing\nmodes. Additionally, we find strong correlations of lasing peak intensities\nacross wavelengths. A simple mean-field statistical model captures the observed\none- and two-point statistics, where correlations in emission intensity arise\nfrom competition among all lasing modes for limited gain.\n", "  Characteristic patterns of cosmic neutrino spectrum reported by the IceCube\ncollaboration and long-standing inconsistency between theory and experiment in\nmuon anomalous magnetic moment are simultaneously explained by an extra\nleptonic force mediated by a gauge field with a mass of the MeV scale. With\ndifferent assumptions for redshift distribution of cosmic neutrino sources,\ndiffuse neutrino flux is calculated with the scattering between cosmic neutrino\nand cosmic neutrino background through the new leptonic force. Our analysis\nsheds light on a relation among lepton physics at the three different scales,\nPeV, MeV, and eV, and provides possible clues to the distribution of sources of\ncosmic neutrino and also to neutrino mass spectrum.\n", "  We investigate the magnetic and electronic properties of the Gd$T_2$Zn$_{20}$\n($T$ = Fe and Co) compounds using X-ray resonant magnetic scattering (XRMS),\nX-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and X-ray magnetic circular\ndichroism (XMCD) techniques. The XRMS measurements reveal that the\nGdCo$_2$Zn$_{20}$ compound has a commensurate antiferromagnetic spin structure\nwith a magnetic propagation vector $\\vec{\\tau}$ =\n$(\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2})$ below the N\\'eel temperature ($T_N\n\\sim$ 5.7 K). Only the Gd ions carry a magnetic moment forming an\nantiferromagnetic structure with magnetic representation $\\Gamma_6$. For the\nferromagnetic GdFe$_2$Zn$_{20}$ compound, an extensive investigation was\nperformed at low temperature and under magnetic field using XANES and XMCD\ntechniques. A strong XMCD signal of about 12.5 $\\%$ and 9.7 $\\%$ is observed\nbelow the Curie temperature ($T_C \\sim$ 85 K) at the Gd-$L_2$ and $L_3$ edges,\nrespectively. In addition, a small magnetic signal of about 0.06 $\\%$ of the\njump is recorded at the Zn $K$-edge suggesting that the Zn 4$p$ states are spin\npolarized by the Gd 5$d$ extended orbitals.\n", "  The physical Hamiltonian of a gravity-matter system depends on the choice of\ntime, with the vacuum naturally identified as its ground state. We study the\nexpanding universe with scalar field in the volume time gauge. We show that the\nvacuum energy density computed from the resulting Hamiltonian is a non-linear\nfunction of the cosmological constant and time. This result provides a new\nperspective on the relation between time, the cosmological constant, and vacuum\nenergy.\n", "  In this paper, we investigate three symmetry breaking effects in strong and\nradiative decays of strange heavy mesons. We study 1/m_Q corrections within the\nheavy quark effect theory, as well as SU(3) and SU(2) symmetry breakings\ninduced by light quark mass differences and the \\eta-\\pi mixing vertex. These\neffects are studied in a covariant model. The numerical results show that the\n1/m_Q corrections of the coupling constants are consistent with \\alpha_s\n\\Lambda_{QCD}/m_Q. The SU(3) symmetry violating effect of the strong coupling\nconstant is obviously larger than that of the magnetic coupling constant. The\nvalue of the \\eta-\\pi mixing vertex has some changes because of the renewed\ndata. As compared with the other theoretical calculations and the experimental\ndata, our radiative decay rates are much larger than those of the other\ntheoretical methods, except for \\chiPT; however, our branching ratios are close\nto the experimental data.\n", "  Approximate de Sitter symmetry of inflating Universe is responsible for the\napproximate flatness of the power spectrum of scalar perturbations. However,\nthis is not the only option. Another symmetry which can explain nearly\nscale-invariant power spectrum is conformal invariance. We give a short review\nof models based on conformal symmetry which lead to the scale-invariant\nspectrum of the scalar perturbations. We discuss also potentially observable\nfeatures of these models.\n", "  Experiments in the high-luminosity runs at the Large Hadron Collider face the\nchallenges of very large pile-up. Primary techniques to deal with this are\nbased on precise vertex and track reconstruction. Outside tracker acceptances,\nhowever, lie regions of interest for many aspects of the LHC physics program.\nWe explore complementary approaches to pile-up treatment and propose a\ndata-driven jet-mixing method which can be used outside tracker acceptances\nwithout depending on Monte Carlo generators. The method can be applied to treat\ncorrelation observables and take into account, besides the jet transverse\nmomentum pedestal, effects of hard jets from pile-up.\n", "  While the thermoelectric figure of merit zT above 300K has seen significant\nimprovement recently, the progress at lower temperatures has been slow, mainly\nlimited by the relatively low Seebeck coefficient and high thermal\nconductivity. Here we report, for the first time, success in first-principles\ncomputation of the phonon drag effect - a coupling phenomenon between electrons\nand non-equilibrium phonons - in heavily doped region and its optimization to\nenhance the Seebeck coefficient while reducing the phonon thermal conductivity\nby nanostructuring. Our simulation quantitatively identifies the major phonons\ncontributing to the phonon drag, which are spectrally distinct from those\ncarrying heat, and further reveals that while the phonon drag is reduced in\nheavily-doped samples, a significant contribution to Seebeck coefficient still\nexists. An ideal phonon filter is proposed to enhance zT of silicon at room\ntemperature by a factor of 20 to around 0.25, and the enhancement can reach 70\ntimes at 100K. This work opens up a new venue towards better thermoelectrics by\nharnessing non-equilibrium phonons.\n", "  Infrared singularities in massless gauge theories are known since the\nfoundation of quantum field theories. The root of this problem can be tracked\nback to the very definition of these long-range interacting theories such as\nQED. It can be shown that singularities are caused by the massless degrees of\nfreedom (i.e. the photons in the case of QED). In the Bloch-Nordsieck model the\nabsence of the infrared catastrophe can be shown exactly by the complete\nsummation of the radiative corrections. In this paper we will give the idea of\nthe derivation of the Bloch-Nordsieck propagator, that describes the infrared\nstructure of the electron propagation, at zero and finite temperatures. Some\nideas of the possible applications are also mentioned.\n", "  We explore two saddle point inflationary scenarios in the context of higher\norder corrections related to different generalisations of general relativity.\nFirstly, we deal with Jordan frame Starobinsky potential, for which we identify\na portion of a parameter space of inflection point inflation, which can\naccommodate all the experimental results. Secondly, we analyse Higgs inflation\nand more specifically the influence of non-renormalisible terms on the standard\nquartic potential. All results were verified with the PLANCK 2015 data.\n", "  To explore the connection between the global physical properties of galaxies\nand their far-infrared (FIR) spectral energy distributions (SEDs), we study the\nvariation in the FIR SEDs of a set of hydrodynamically simulated galaxies that\nare generated by performing dust radiative transfer in post-processing. Our\nsample includes both isolated and merging systems at various stages of the\nmerging process and covers infrared (IR) luminosities and dust masses that are\nrepresentative of both low- and high-redshift galaxies. We study the FIR SEDs\nusing principle component analysis (PCA) and find that 97\\% of the variance in\nthe sample can be explained by two principle components (PCs). The first PC\ncharacterizes the wavelength of the peak of the FIR SED, and the second encodes\nthe breadth of the SED. We find that the coefficients of both PCs can be\npredicted well using a double power law in terms of the IR luminosity and dust\nmass, which suggests that these two physical properties are the primary\ndeterminants of galaxies' FIR SED shapes. Incorporating galaxy sizes does not\nsignificantly improve our ability to predict the FIR SEDs. Our results suggest\nthat the observed redshift evolution in the effective dust temperature at fixed\nIR luminosity is not driven by geometry: the SEDs of $z \\sim 2-3$ ultraluminous\nIR galaxies (ULIRGs) are cooler than those of local ULIRGs not because the\nhigh-redshift galaxies are more extended but rather because they have higher\ndust masses at fixed IR luminosity. Finally, based on our simulations, we\nintroduce a two-parameter set of SED templates that depend on both IR\nluminosity and dust mass.\n", "  We propose a computational framework for the self-consistent dynamics of a\nmicrosphere system driven by a pulsed acoustic field in an ideal fluid. Our\nframework combines a molecular dynamics integrator describing the dynamics of\nthe microsphere system with a time-dependent integral equation solver for the\nacoustic field that makes use of fields represented as surface expansions in\nspherical harmonic basis functions. The presented approach allows us to\ndescribe the inter-particle interaction induced by the field as well as the\ndynamics of trapping in counter-propagating acoustic pulses. The integral\nequation formulation leads to equations of motion for the microspheres\ndescribing the effect of non-dissipative drag forces. We show (1) that the\nfield-induced interactions between the microspheres give rise to effective\ndipolar interactions, with effective dipoles defined by their velocities, and\n(2) that the dominant effect of an ultrasound pulse through a cloud of\nmicrospheres gives rise mainly to a translation of the system, though we also\nobserve both expansion and contraction of the cloud determined by the initial\nsystem geometry.\n", "  By using transitionless quantum driving algorithm (TQDA), we present an\nefficient scheme for the shortcuts to the holonomic quantum computation (HQC).\nIt works in decoherence-free subspace (DFS) and the adiabatic process can be\nspeeded up in the shortest possible time. More interestingly, we give a\nphysical implementation for our shortcuts to HQC with nitrogen-vacancy centers\nin diamonds dispersively coupled to a whispering-gallery mode microsphere\ncavity. It can be efficiently realized by controlling appropriately the\nfrequencies of the external laser pulses. Also, our scheme has good scalability\nwith more qubits. Different from previous works, we first use TQDA to realize a\nuniversal HQC in DFS, including not only two noncommuting accelerated\nsingle-qubit holonomic gates but also a accelerated two-qubit holonomic\ncontrolled-phase gate, which provides the necessary shortcuts for the complete\nset of gates required for universal quantum computation. Moreover, our\nexperimentally realizable shortcuts require only two-body interactions, not\nfour-body ones, and they work in the dispersive regime, which relax greatly the\ndifficulty of their physical implementation in experiment. Our numerical\ncalculations show that the present scheme is robust against decoherence with\ncurrent experimental parameters.\n", "  We study the behavior of dynamically-generated baryon resonances with\nheavy-quark content within a unitarized coupled-channel theory in matter that\nfulfills heavy-quark spin symmetry constraints. We analyze the implications for\nthe formation of charmed mesic nuclei and the propagation of heavy mesons in\nheavy-ion collisions from RHIC to FAIR.\n", "  With appropriate interpolating currents the mass spectra of $0^{+-}$,\n$1^{-+}$, and $2^{+-}$ oddballs are studied in the framework of QCD sum rules\n(QCDSR). We find there exits one stable $0^{+-}$ oddball with mass of $4.57 \\pm\n0.13 \\, \\text{GeV}$, and one stable $2^{+-}$ oddball with mass of $6.06 \\pm\n0.13 \\, \\text{GeV}$, whereas, no stable $1^{-+}$ oddball shows up. The possible\nproduction and decay modes of these glueballs with unconventional quantum\nnumbers are analyzed, which are hopefully measurable in either BELLEII, PANDA,\nSuper-B or LHCb experiments.\n", "  We discuss theoretical scenarios on crossover between nuclear matter (NM) and\nquark matter (QM). We classify various possibilities into three major scenarios\naccording to the onset of diquark degrees of freedom that characterizes\ncolor-superconducting (CSC) states. In the conventional scenario NM occurs at\nthe liquid-gas (or liquid-vacuum at zero temperature) phase transition and QM\noccurs next, after which CSC eventually appears. With the effect of strong\ncorrelation, the BEC-BCS scenario implies that CSC occurs next to NM and QM\ncomes last in the BCS regime. We adopt the quarkyonic scenario in which NM, QM,\nand CSC are theoretically indistinguishable and thus these names refer to not\ndistinct states but relevant descriptions of the same physical system. Based on\nthis idea we propose a natural scheme to interpolate NM near normal nuclear\ndensity and CSC with vector coupling at high baryon density. We finally discuss\nthe mass-radius relation of the neutron star and constraints on parameters in\nthe proposed scheme.\n", "  For a modified Randall-Sundrum model [Phys. Rev. D 88 (2013) 025048], the\ngraviton equations are derived and the mass spectrum found. The latter includes\na massless graviton and a continuum mass with a gap. There is no negative\nmass-squared in the spectrum, so the model is stable. The gravitational\nNewtonian limit is obtained with an exponentially suppressed modification from\nextra dimension.\n", "  Results of Positron Annihilation Lifetime Spectroscopy (PALS) and microscopic\nstudies on simple microorganisms: brewing yeasts are presented. Lifetime of\northo - positronium (o-Ps) were found to change from 2.4 to 2.9 ns (longer\nlived component) for lyophilised and aqueous yeasts, respectively. Also\nhygroscopicity of yeasts in time was examined, allowing to check how water -\nthe main component of the cell - affects PALS parameters, thus lifetime of o-Ps\nwere found to change from 1.2 to 1.4 ns (shorter lived component) for the dried\nyeasts. The time sufficient to hydrate the cells was found below 10 hours. In\nthe presence of liquid water an indication of reorganization of yeast in the\nmolecular scale was observed.\n  Microscopic images of the lyophilised, dried and wet yeasts with best\npossible resolution were obtained using Inverted Microscopy (IM) and\nEnvironmental Scanning Electron Microscopy (ESEM) methods. As a result visible\nchanges to the surface of the cell membrane were observed in ESEM images.\n", "  At a quantum critical point, bipartite entanglement entropies have universal\nquantities which are subleading to the ubiquitous area law. For Renyi\nentropies, these terms are known to be similar to the von Neumann entropy,\nwhile being much more amenable to numerical and even experimental measurement.\nWe show here that when calculating universal properties of Renyi entropies, it\nis important to account for unusual corrections to scaling that arise from\nrelevant local operators present at the conical singularity in the\nmulti-sheeted Riemann surface. These corrections grow in importance with\nincreasing Renyi index. We present studies of Renyi correlation functions in\nthe 1+1 transverse-field Ising model (TFIM) using conformal field theory,\nmapping to free fermions, and series expansions, and the logarithmic entropy\nsingularity at a corner in 2+1 for both free bosonic field theory and the TFIM,\nusing numerical linked cluster expansions. In all numerical studies, accurate\nresults are only obtained when unusual corrections to scaling are taken into\naccount. In the worst case, an analysis ignoring these corrections can get\nqualitatively incorrect answers, such as predicting a decrease in critical\nexponents with the Renyi index, when they are actually increasing. We discuss a\ntwo-step extrapolation procedure that can be used to account for the unusual\ncorrections to scaling.\n", "  Heavy vector-like quarks of charge $-1/3$, $B$, have been searched for at the\nLHC through the decays $B\\rightarrow bZ,\\, bh,\\,tW$. In models where the $B$\nquark also carries charge under a new gauge group, new decay channels may\ndominate. We focus on the case where the $B$ is charged under a $U(1)^\\prime$\nand describe simple models where the dominant decay mode is $B\\rightarrow\nbZ^\\prime\\rightarrow b (b\\bar{b})$. With the inclusion of dark matter such\nmodels can explain the excess of gamma rays from the Galactic center. We\ndevelop a search strategy for this decay chain and estimate that with\nintegrated luminosity of 300 fb$^{-1}$ the LHC will have the potential to\ndiscover both the $B$ and the $Z'$ for $B$ quarks with mass below $\\sim 1.6$\nTeV, for a broad range of $Z'$ masses. A high-luminosity run can extend this\nreach to $2$ TeV.\n", "  Endocytosis is an essential process by which cells internalize a piece of\nplasma membrane and material from the outside. In cells with turgor, pressure\nopposes membrane defor- mations, and increases the amount of force that has to\nbe generated by the endocytic machinery. To determine this force, and calculate\nthe shape of the membrane, we used physical theory to model an elastic surface\nunder pressure. Accurate fits of experimental profiles are obtained assuming\nthat the coated membrane is highly rigid and preferentially curved at the\nendocytic site. The forces required from the actin machinery peaks at the onset\nof deformation, indicating that once invagination has been initiated,\nendocytosis is unlikely to stall before completion. Coat proteins do not lower\nthe initiation force but may affect the process by the curvature they induce.\nIn the presence of isotropic curvature inducers, pulling the tip of the\ninvagination can trigger the formation of a neck at the base of the\ninvagination. Hence direct neck constriction by actin may not be required,\nwhile its pulling role is essential. Finally, the theory shows that anisotropic\ncurvature effectors stabilize membrane invaginations, and the loss of\ncrescent-shaped BAR domain proteins such as Rvs167 could therefore trigger\nmembrane scission.\n", "  Iteratively Re-weighted Least Squares (IRLS) were used to simulate the\n$L_p$-norm approximation of the ballistic trajectory in absolute gravimeters.\nTwo iterations of the IRLS delivered sufficient accuracy of the approximation\nwithout a significant bias. The simulations were performed on different\nsamplings and perturbations of the trajectory. For the platykurtic\ndistributions of the perturbations, the $L_p$-approximation with $3<p<4$ was\nfound to yield several times more precise gravity estimates compared to the\nstandard least-squares. The simulation results were confirmed by processing\nreal gravity observations performed at the excessive noise conditions.\n", "  The natural neutron background influences the maximum achievable sensitivity\nin most deep underground nuclear, astroparticle and double-beta decay physics\nexperiments. Reliable neutron flux numbers are an important ingredient in the\ndesign of the shielding of new large-scale experiments as well as in the\nanalysis of experimental data.\n  Using a portable setup of He-3 counters we measured the thermal neutron flux\nat the Kimballton Underground Research Facility, the Soudan Underground\nLaboratory, on the 4100 ft and the 4850 ft levels of the Sanford Underground\nResearch Facility, at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant and at the Gran Sasso\nNational Laboratory. Absolute neutron fluxes at these laboratories are\npresented.\n", "  Segue 1 is the current best candidate for a \"first galaxy\", a system which\nexperienced only a single short burst of star formation and has since remained\nunchanged. Here we present possible star formation scenarios which can explain\nits unique metallicity distribution. While the majority of stars in all other\nultra-faint dwarfs (UFDs) are within 0.5 dex of the mean [Fe/H] for the galaxy,\n5 of the 7 stars in Segue 1 have a spread of $\\Delta$[Fe/H] $>0.8$ dex. We show\nthat this distribution of metallicities canot be explained by a gradual\nbuild-up of stars, but instead requires clustered star formation. Chemical\ntagging allows the separate unresolved delta functions in abundance space to be\nassociated with discrete events in space and time. This provides an opportunity\nto put the enrichment events into a time sequence and unravel the history of\nthe system. We investigate two possible scenarios for the star formation\nhistory of Segue 1 using Fyris Alpha simulations of gas in a $10^7$ M$_\\odot$\ndark matter halo. The lack of stars with intermediate metallicities $-3<$\n[Fe/H] $<-2$ can be explained either by a pause in star formation caused by\nsupernova feedback, or by the spread of metallicities resulting from one or two\nsupernovae in a low-mass dark matter halo. Either possibility can reproduce the\nmetallicity distribution function (MDF), as well as the other observed\nelemental abundances. The unusual MDF and the low luminosity of Segue 1 can be\nexplained by it being a first galaxy that originated with\n$M_{\\rm{vir}}\\sim10^7$~M$_\\odot$ at $z\\sim10$.\n", "  Kelly (2007, hereafter K07) described an efficient algorithm, using Gibbs\nsampling, for performing linear regression in the fairly general case where\nnon-zero measurement errors exist for both the covariates and response\nvariables, where these measurements may be correlated (for the same data\npoint), where the response variable is affected by intrinsic scatter in\naddition to measurement error, and where the prior distribution of covariates\nis modeled by a flexible mixture of Gaussians rather than assumed to be\nuniform. Here I extend the K07 algorithm in two ways. First, the procedure is\ngeneralized to the case of multiple response variables. Second, I describe how\nto model the prior distribution of covariates using a Dirichlet process, which\ncan be thought of as a Gaussian mixture where the number of mixture components\nis learned from the data. I present an example of multivariate regression using\nthe extended algorithm, namely fitting scaling relations of the gas mass,\ntemperature, and luminosity of dynamically relaxed galaxy clusters as a\nfunction of their mass and redshift. An implementation of the Gibbs sampler in\nthe R language, called LRGS, is provided.\n", "  In this paper we construct an unfolded formulation for the massive bosonic\nhigher spins in three dimensions as well as for their partially massless limit\nof the maximal depth. We begin with the equations for the one-forms coming from\nthe frame-like gauge invariant Lagrangians for such fields and then we\nsupplement them with the infinite number of equations for the appropriately\nchosen set of zero-forms.\n", "  The density-functional approach to quantum electrodynamics is extending\ntraditional density-functional theory and opens the possibility to describe\nelectron-photon interactions in terms of effective Kohn-Sham potentials. In\nthis work, we numerically construct the exact electron-photon Kohn-Sham\npotentials for a prototype system which consists of a trapped electron coupled\nto a quantized electromagnetic mode in an optical high-Q cavity. While the\neffective current that acts on the photons is known explicitly, the exact\neffective potential that describes the forces exerted by the photons on the\nelectrons is obtained from a fixed-point inversion scheme. This procedure\nallows us to uncover important beyond-mean-field features of the effective\npotential which mark the breakdown of classical light-matter interactions. We\nobserve peak and step structures in the effective potentials, which can be\nattributed solely to the quantum nature of light, i.e., they are real-space\nsignatures of the photons. Our findings show how the ubiquitous dipole\ninteraction with a classical electromagnetic field has to be modified in\nreal-space in order to take the quantum nature of the electromagnetic field\nfully into account.\n", "  In this paper we present prospects for using the J-PET detector to search for\ndiscrete symmetries violations in a purely leptonic system of the positronium\natom. We discuss tests of CP and CPT symmetries by means of ortho-positronium\ndecays into three photons. No zero expectation values for chosen correlations\nbetween ortho-positronium spin and momentum vectors of photons would imply the\nexistence of physics phenomena beyond the Standard Model. Previous measurements\nresulted in violation amplitude parameters for CP and CPT symmetries consistent\nwith zero, with an uncertainty of about 10-3. The J-PET detector allows to\ndetermine those values with better precision thanks to a unique time and\nangular esolution combined with a high geometrical acceptance. Achieving the\naforementioned is possible due to application of polymer scintillators instead\nof crystals as detectors of annihilation quanta.\n", "  Hagedorn states (HS) are a tool to model the hadronization process which\noccurs in the phase transition region between the quark gluon plasma (QGP) and\nthe hadron resonance gas (HRG). These states are believed to appear near the\nHagedorn temperature $T_H$ which in our understanding equals the critical\ntemperature $T_c$. A covariantly formulated bootstrap equation is solved to\ngenerate the zoo of these particles characterized baryon number $B$,\nstrangeness $S$ and electric charge $Q$. These hadron-like resonances are\ncharacterized by being very massive and by not being limited to quantum numbers\nof known hadrons. All hadronic properties like masses, spectral functions\netc.are taken from the hadronic transport model Ultra Relativistic Quantum\nMolecular Dynamics (UrQMD). Decay chains of single Hagedorn states provide a\nwell description of experimentally observed multiplicity ratios of strange and\nmulti-strange particles. In addition, the final energy spectra of resulting\nhadrons show a thermal-like distribution with the characteristic Hagedorn\ntemperature $T_H$. Box calculations including these Hagedorn states are\nperformed. Indeed, the time scales leading to equilibration of the system are\ndrastically reduced down to 2...5 fm/c.\n", "  One-dimensional Bose gas with contact interaction in optical lattices at zero\ntemperature is investigated by means of the exact diffusion Monte Carlo\nalgorithm. The results obtained from the fundamental continuous model are\ncompared with those obtained from the lattice (discrete) Bose-Hubbard model,\nusing exact diagonalization, and from the quantum sine-Gordon model. We map out\nthe complete phase diagram of the continuous model and determine the regions of\napplicability of the Bose-Hubbard model. Various physical quantities\ncharacterizing the systems are calculated and it is demonstrated that the\nsine-Gordon model used for shallow lattices is inaccurate.\n", "  The present work is based on the idea of an interacting framework of new\nholographic dark energy with cold dark matter in the background of $f(T)$\ngravity. Here, we have considered the flat modified Friedmann universe for\n$f(T)$ gravity which is filled with new Holographic dark energy and dark\nmatter. We have derived some cosmological parameters like Deceleration\nparameter, EoS parameter, State-finder parameters, Cosmographic parameters,\n{\\it Om} parameter and graphically investigated the nature of these parameters\nfor the above mentioned interacting scenario. The results are found to be\nconsistent with the accelerating universe. Also we have graphically\ninvestigated the trajectories in $\\omega $--$ \\omega'$ plane for different\nvalues of the interacting parameter and explored the freezing region and\nthawing region in $\\omega $--$ \\omega'$ plane. Finally, we have analyzed the\nstability of this model.\n", "  Gallium nitride nanowires were grown on c-plane, r-plane and m-plane sapphire\nsubstrates in a showerhead metalorganic chemical vapor deposition system using\nnickel catalyst with trimethylgallium and ammonia as precursors. We studied the\ninfluence of carrier gas, growth temperature, reactor pressure, reactant flow\nrates and substrate orientation in order to obtain thin nanowires. The\nnanowires grew along the <10-11> and <10-10> axes depending on the substrate\norientation. These nanowires were further characterized using x-ray\ndiffraction, electron microscopy, photoluminescence and Raman spectroscopy.\n", "  We explore the use of the Inverse Amplitude Method for unitarization of\nscattering amplitudes to derive the existence and properties of possible new\nheavy states associated with perturbative extensions of the electroweak\nbreaking sector of the Standard Model starting from the low energy effective\ntheory. We use a toy effective theory generated by integrating out a heavy\nsinglet scalar and compare the pole mass and width of the unitarized amplitudes\nwith those of the original model. Our results show that the Inverse Amplitude\nMethod reproduces correctly the singlet mass up to factors of O(1-3), but its\nwidth is overestimated.\n", "  The strongly correlated spin-electron system on a diamond chain containing\nlocalized Ising spins on its nodal lattice sites and mobile electrons on its\ninterstitial sites is exactly solved in a magnetic field using the\ntransfer-matrix method. We have investigated in detail all available ground\nstates, the magnetization processes, the spin-spin correlation functions around\nan elementary plaquette, fermionic quantum concurrence and spin frustration. It\nis shown that the fermionic entanglement between mobile electrons hopping on\ninterstitial sites and the kinetically-induced spin frustration are closely\nrelated yet independent phenomena. In the ground state, quantum entanglement\nonly appears within a frustrated unsaturated paramagnetic phase, while thermal\nfluctuations can promote some degree of quantum entanglement above the\nnon-frustrated ground states with saturated paramagnetic or classical\nferrimagnetic spin arrangements.\n", "  The low-temperature properties of systems characterized by a spontaneously\nbroken internal rotation symmetry, O($N$) $\\to$ O($N$-1), are governed by\nGoldstone bosons and can be derived systematically within effective Lagrangian\nfield theory. In the present study we consider systems living in two spatial\ndimensions, and evaluate their partition function at low temperatures up to\nthree-loop order. Although our results are valid for any such system, here we\nuse magnetic terminology, i.e., we refer to quantum spin systems. We discuss\nthe sign of the Goldstone boson interaction in the pressure, staggered\nmagnetization, and susceptibility as a function of an external staggered field\nfor general $N$. As it turns out, the $d$=2+1 quantum XY model ($N$=2) and the\n$d$=2+1 Heisenberg antiferromagnet ($N$=3), are rather special, as they\nrepresent the only cases where the spin-wave interaction in the pressure is\nrepulsive in the whole parameter regime where the effective expansion applies.\nRemarkably, the $d$=2+1 XY model is the only system where the interaction\ncontribution in the staggered magnetization (susceptibility) tends to positive\n(negative) values at low temperatures and weak external field.\n", "  In this paper we present the techniques for computing cosmological bounces in\npolynomial $f(R)$ theories, whose order is more than two, for spatially flat\nFLRW spacetime. In these cases the conformally connected Einstein frame shows\nup multiple scalar potentials predicting various possibilities of cosmological\nevolution in the Jordan frame where the $f(R)$ theory lives. We present a\nreasonable way in which one can associate the various possible potentials in\nthe Einstein frame, for cubic $f(R)$ gravity, to the cosmological development\nin the Jordan frame. The issue concerning the energy conditions in $f(R)$\ntheories is presented. We also point out the very important relationships\nbetween the conformal transformations connecting the Jordan frame and the\nEinstein frame and the various instabilities of $f(R)$ theory. All the\ncalculations are done for cubic $f(R)$ gravity but we hope the results are\nsufficiently general for higher order polynomial gravity.\n", "  Hysteretic losses in MgB2 wound superconducting coils of a 500 kW synchronous\nhybrid generator were estimated as part of the European project SUPRAPOWER led\nby the Spanish company Tecnalia Research and Innovation. Particular interest\nwas given to the losses found in tapes in the superconducting rotor caused by\nthe magnetic flux ripples originating from the conventional stator during\nnominal operation. To compute the losses, a 2D Finite Element Method was\napplied to solve the H-formulation of Maxwell's equations considering the\nnonlinear properties of both the superconducting material and its surrounding\nNi matrix. To be able to model all the different turns composing the winding of\nthe superconducting rotor coils, three geometrical models of single tape cross\nsection of decreasing complexity were studied: 1) the first model reproduced\nclosely the actual cross section obtained from micrographs, 2) the second model\nwas obtained from the computed elastoplastic deformation of a round Ni wire, 3)\nthe last model was based on a simplified elliptic cross section. The last\ngeometry allowed validating the modeling technique by comparing numerical\nlosses with results from well-established analytical expressions. Additionally,\nthe following cases of filament transpositions were studied: no, partial and\nfull transposition. Finally, choosing the right level of geometrical details to\npredict the expected behavior of individual superconducting tapes in the rotor,\nthe following operational regimes were studied: Bias-DC current, ramping\ncurrent under ramping background field, and magnetic flux ripples under DC\nbackground current and field.\n", "  We present a photometric catalog of 8,735,004 proper motion selected low-mass\nstars (KML-spectral types) within the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)\nfootprint, from the combined SDSS Data Release 10 (DR10), Two-Micron All-Sky\nSurvey (2MASS) Point Source Catalog (PSC), and Wide-field Infrared Survey\nExplorer (WISE) AllWISE catalog. Stars were selected using $r-i$, $i-z$, $r-z$,\n$z-J$, and $z-W1$ colors, and SDSS, WISE, and 2MASS astrometry was combined to\ncompute proper motions. The resulting 3,518,150 stars were augmented with\nproper motions for 5,216,854 earlier type stars from the combined SDSS and\nUnited States Naval Observatory B1.0 catalog (USNO-B). We used SDSS+USNO-B\nproper motions to determine the best criteria for selecting a clean sample of\nstars. Only stars whose proper motions were greater than their $2$$\\sigma$\nuncertainty were included. Our Motion Verified Red Stars (MoVeRS) catalog is\navailable through SDSS CasJobs and VizieR.\n", "  Energies of the giant Gamow-Teller and analog resonances - $E_{\\rm G}$ and\n$E_{\\rm A}$, are presented, calculated using the microscopic theory of finite\nFermi system. The calculated differences $\\Delta E_{\\rm G-A}=E_{\\rm G}-E_{\\rm\nA}$ go to zero in heavier nuclei indicating the restoration of Wigner\nSU(4)-symmetry. The calculated $\\Delta E_{\\rm G-A}$ values are in good\nagreement with the experimental data. The average deviation is 0.30 MeV for the\n33 considered nuclei for which experimental data is available. The $\\Delta\nE_{\\rm G-A}$ values were calculated for heavy and superheavy nuclei up to the\nmass number $A $= 290. Using the experimental data for the analog resonances\nenergies, the isotopic dependence of the difference of the Coulomb energies of\nneighboring nuclei isobars analyzed within the SU(4)-approach for more than 400\nnuclei in the mass number range of $A$ = 3 - 244. The Wigner SU(4)-symmetry\nrestoration for heavy and superheavy nuclei is confirmed. It is shown that the\nrestoration of SU(4)-symmetry does not contradict the possibility of the\nexistence of the \"island of stability\" in the region of superheavy nuclei.\n", "  We report on the measurement of hadron composition in charged jets in pp at\n$\\sqrt{s}=7$ TeV and show the first data on particle type dependent jet\nfragmentation at the LHC. Further, we present\n$(\\Lambda+\\bar{\\Lambda})/2$K$^{0}_{\\mathrm{S}}$ ratios measured in charged jets\nin Pb-Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\mathrm{NN}}} = 2.76$ TeV and in p-Pb\ncollisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\mathrm{NN}}} = 5.02$ TeV. While the ratio of the\ninclusive $p_{\\mathrm{T}}$ spectra of $\\Lambda$ and K$^{0}_{\\mathrm{S}}$\nexhibits centrality dependent enhancement both in Pb-Pb and p-Pb system, the\n$(\\Lambda+\\bar{\\Lambda})/2$K$^{0}_{\\mathrm{S}}$ ratio measured in charged jets\nreveals that jet fragmentation does not contribute to the observed baryon\nanomaly.\n  Finally, we discuss the measurement of semi-inclusive $p_{\\mathrm{T}}$\nspectra of charged jets that recoil from a high-$p_{\\mathrm{T}}$ hadron trigger\nin Pb-Pb and pp collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\mathrm{NN}}} = 2.76$ TeV and $\\sqrt{s}\n= 7$ TeV, respectively. The jet yield uncorrelated with the trigger hadron is\nremoved at the event-ensemble level without introducing a bias on the jet\npopulation which is therefore infrared and collinear safe. The recoil jet yield\nin central Pb-Pb is found to be suppressed w.r.t. that from pp PYTHIA\nreference. On the other hand, there is no sign of intra-jet broadening even for\nanti-$k_{\\mathrm{T}}$ jets with a resolution parameter as large as $R=0.5$.\n", "  Gas inflow feeds galaxies with low metallicity gas from the cosmic web,\nsustaining star formation across the Hubble time. We make a connection between\nthese inflows and metallicity inhomogeneities in star-forming galaxies, by\nusing synthetic narrow-band images of the Halpha emission line from zoom-in AMR\ncosmological simulations of galaxies with stellar masses of $M \\simeq 10^9\n$Msun at redshifts z=2-7. In $\\sim$50\\% of the cases at redshifts lower than 4,\nthe gas inflow gives rise to star-forming, Halpha-bright, off-centre clumps.\nMost of these clumps have gas metallicities, weighted by Halpha luminosity,\nlower than the metallicity in the surrounding interstellar medium by $\\sim$0.3\ndex, consistent with observations of chemical inhomogeneities at high and low\nredshifts. Due to metal mixing by shear and turbulence, these metallicity drops\nare dissolved in a few disc dynamical times. Therefore, they can be considered\nas evidence for rapid gas accretion coming from cosmological inflow of pristine\ngas.\n", "  The location of the critical end point of QCD has been determined in previous\nstudies of $N_f=2+1$ and $N_f=2+1+1$ dynamical quark flavors using a\n(truncated) set of Dyson-Schwinger equations for the quark and gluon\npropagators of Landau-gauge QCD. A source for systematic errors in these\ncalculations has been the omission of terms in the quark-gluon interaction that\ncan be parametrized in terms of baryonic degrees of freedom. These have a\npotentially large dependence on chemical potential and therefore may affect the\nlocation of the critical end point. In this exploratory study we estimate the\neffects of these contributions, both in the vacuum and at finite temperature\nand chemical potential. We find only a small influence of baryonic\ncontributions on the location of the critical end point. We estimate the\nrobustness of this result by parameterizing further dependencies on chemical\npotential.\n", "  In order to explain the recently reported peak at $3.55$ keV in the galactic\nx-ray spectrum, we propose a simple model. In this model, the Standard Model is\nextended by including a neutral spin-$3/2$ vector-like fermion that transforms\nlike a singlet under SM gauge group. This $7.1$ keV spin-$3/2$ fermion is\nconsidered to comprise a portion of the observed dark matter. Its decay into a\nneutrino and a photon with decay life commensurate with the observed data, fits\nthe relic dark matter density and obeys the astrophysical constraints from the\nsupernova cooling.\n", "  This is the fourth in a series of papers studying the astrophysics and\ncosmology of massive, dynamically relaxed galaxy clusters. Here, we use\nmeasurements of weak gravitational lensing from the Weighing the Giants project\nto calibrate Chandra X-ray measurements of total mass that rely on the\nassumption of hydrostatic equilibrium. This comparison of X-ray and lensing\nmasses provides a measurement of the combined bias of X-ray hydrostatic masses\ndue to both astrophysical and instrumental sources. Assuming a fixed cosmology,\nand within a characteristic radius (r_2500) determined from the X-ray data, we\nmeasure a lensing to X-ray mass ratio of 0.96 +/- 9% (stat) +/- 9% (sys). We\nfind no significant trends of this ratio with mass, redshift or the\nmorphological indicators used to select the sample. In accordance with\npredictions from hydro simulations for the most massive, relaxed clusters, our\nresults disfavor strong, tens-of-percent departures from hydrostatic\nequilibrium at these radii. In addition, we find a mean concentration of the\nsample measured from lensing data of c_200 = $3.0_{-1.8}^{+4.4}$. Anticipated\nshort-term improvements in lensing systematics, and a modest expansion of the\nrelaxed lensing sample, can easily increase the measurement precision by\n30--50%, leading to similar improvements in cosmological constraints that\nemploy X-ray hydrostatic mass estimates, such as on Omega_m from the cluster\ngas mass fraction.\n", "  We propose a new framework to represent the perturbative S-matrix which is\nwell-defined for all quantum field theories of massless particles, constructed\nfrom tree-level amplitudes and integrable term-by-term. This representation is\nderived from the Feynman expansion through a series of partial fraction\nidentities, discarding terms that vanish upon integration. Loop integrands are\nexpressed in terms of \"Q-cuts\" that involve both off-shell and on-shell\nloop-momenta, defined with a precise contour prescription that can be evaluated\nby ordinary methods. This framework implies recent results found in the\nscattering equation formalism at one-loop, and it has a natural extension to\nall orders---even non-planar theories without well-defined forward limits or\ngood ultraviolet behavior.\n", "  N-body simulations suggest that the substructures that survive inside dark\nmatter haloes follow universal distributions in mass and radial number density.\nWe demonstrate that a simple analytical model can explain these subhalo\ndistributions as resulting from tidal stripping which increasingly reduces the\nmass of subhaloes with decreasing halo-centric distance. As a starting point,\nthe spatial distribution of subhaloes of any given infall mass is shown to be\nlargely indistinguishable from the overall mass distribution of the host halo.\nUsing a physically motivated statistical description of the amount of mass\nstripped from individual subhaloes, the model fully describes the joint\ndistribution of subhaloes in final mass, infall mass and radius. As a result,\nit can be used to predict several derived distributions involving combinations\nof these quantities including, but not limited to, the universal subhalo mass\nfunction, the subhalo spatial distribution, the gravitational lensing profile,\nthe dark matter annihilation radiation profile and boost factor. This model\nclarifies a common confusion when comparing the spatial distributions of\ngalaxies and subhaloes, the so called \"anti-bias\", as a simple selection\neffect. We provide a Python code SubGen for populating haloes with subhaloes at\nhttp://icc.dur.ac.uk/data/\n", "  We probe small scalar coupling differences via the coherent interactions\nbetween two nuclear spin singlet states in organic molecules. We show that the\nspin-lock induced crossing (SLIC) technique enables the coherent transfer of\nsinglet order between one spin pair and another. The transfer is mediated by\nthe difference in cis and trans vicinal J couplings among the spins. By\nmeasuring the transfer rate, we calculate a J coupling difference of $8 \\pm 2$\nmHz in phenylalanine-glycine-glycine and $2.57 \\pm 0.04$ Hz in glutamate. We\nalso characterize a coherence between two singlet states in glutamate, which\nmay enable the creation of a long-lived quantum memory.\n", "  It remains to be determined experimentally if massive neutrinos are Majorana\nor Dirac particles. In this connection, it has been recently suggested that the\ndetection of cosmic neutrino background of left-handed neutrinos $\\nu^{}_{\\rm\nL}$ and right-handed antineutrinos $\\overline{\\nu}^{}_{\\rm R}$ in future\nexperiments of neutrino capture on beta-decaying nuclei (e.g., $\\nu^{}_e +\n{^3{\\rm H}} \\to {^3}{\\rm He} + e^-$ for the PTOLEMY experiment) is likely to\ndistinguish between Majorana and Dirac neutrinos, since the capture rate is\ntwice larger in the former case. In this paper, we investigate the possible\nimpact of right-handed neutrinos on the capture rate, assuming that massive\nneutrinos are Dirac particles and both right-handed neutrinos $\\nu^{}_{\\rm R}$\nand left-handed antineutrinos $\\overline{\\nu}^{}_{\\rm L}$ can be efficiently\nproduced in the early Universe. It turns out that the capture rate can be\nenhanced at most by $28\\%$ due to the presence of relic $\\nu^{}_{\\rm R}$ and\n$\\overline{\\nu}^{}_{\\rm L}$ with a total number density of $95~{\\rm cm}^{-3}$,\nwhich should be compared to the number density $336~{\\rm cm}^{-3}$ of cosmic\nneutrino background. The enhancement has actually been limited by the latest\ncosmological and astrophysical bounds on the effective number of neutrino\ngenerations $N^{}_{\\rm eff} = 3.14^{+0.44}_{-0.43}$ at the $95\\%$ confidence\nlevel. For illustration, two possible scenarios have been proposed for thermal\nproduction of right-handed neutrinos in the early Universe.\n", "  Potocek and Ferenczi [Phys. Rev. A 92, 023829 (2015)] provided an analysis of\nthe experimental evidence obtained by Danan et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 111,\n240402 (2013)] for the surprising behaviour of photons passing through an\ninterferometer, in particular, motion on disconnected paths. Potocek and\nFerenczi reproduced the results of the experiment, but when analyzing its\nmodification, they claimed that the reasoning of Danan et al., which led to\ndisconnected paths, is erroneous. It is argued here that the criticism of\nPotocek and Ferenczi is unfounded.\n", "  This paper introduces a new scheme of ion beam figuring (IBF), or rather\nvariable-spot IBF, which is conducted at a constant scanning velocity with\nvariable-spot ion beam collimated by a variable diaphragm. It aims at improving\nthe reachability and adaptation of the figuring process within the limits of\nmachine dynamics by varying the ion beam spot size instead of the scanning\nvelocity. In contrast to the dwell time algorithm in the conventional IBF, the\nvariable-spot IBF adopts a new algorithm, which consists of the scan path\nprogramming and the trajectory optimization using pattern search. In this\nalgorithm, instead of the dwell time, a new concept, integral etching time, is\nproposed to interpret the process of variable-spot IBF. We conducted\nsimulations to verify its feasibility and practicality. The simulation results\nindicate the variable-spot IBF is a promising alternative to the conventional\napproach.\n", "  For a large number of real nonlinear equations, either continuous or\ndiscrete, integrable or nonintegrable, we show that whenever a real nonlinear\nequation admits a solution in terms of $\\sech x$, it also admits solutions in\nterms of the PT-invariant combinations $\\sech x \\pm i \\tanh x$. Further, for a\nnumber of real nonlinear equations we show that whenever a nonlinear equation\nadmits a solution in terms $\\sech^2 x$, it also admits solutions in terms of\nthe PT-invariant combinations $\\sech^2 x \\pm i \\sech x \\tanh x$. Besides, we\nshow that similar results are also true in the periodic case involving Jacobi\nelliptic functions.\n", "  We analyze the migration characteristics of a droplet in an oscillatory flow\nfield in a parallel plate micro-confinement. Using phase filed formalism, we\ncapture the dynamical evolution of the droplet over a wide range of the\nfrequency of the imposed oscillation in the flow field, drop size relative to\nthe channel gap, and the capillary number. The latter two factors imply the\ncontribution of droplet deformability, commonly considered in the study of\ndroplet migration under steady shear flow conditions. We show that the imposed\noscillation brings in additional time complexity in the droplet movement,\nrealized through temporally varying drop-shape, flow direction and the inertial\nresponse of the droplet. As a consequence, we observe a spatially complicated\npathway of the droplet along the transverse direction, in sharp contrast to the\nsmooth migration under a similar yet steady shear flow condition. Intuitively,\nthe longitudinal component of the droplet movement is in tandem with the flow\ncontinuity and evolves with time at the same frequency as that of the imposed\noscillation, although, with an amplitude decreasing with the frequency. The\ntime complexity of the transverse component of the movement pattern, however,\ncannot by rationalized through such intuitive arguments. Towards bringing out\nthe underlying physics, we further endeavor in a reciprocal identity based\nanalysis. Following this approach, we unveil the time complexities of the\ndroplet movement, which appear to be sufficient to rationalize the complex\nmovement patterns observed through the comprehensive simulation studies. These\nresults can be of profound importance in designing droplet based microfluidic\nsystems in an oscillatory flow environment.\n", "  Polarimetry with permille-level precision is essential for future\nelectron-positron linear colliders. Compton polarimeters can reach negligible\nstatistical uncertainties within seconds of measurement time. The dominating\nsystematic uncertainties originate from the response and alignment of the\ndetector which records the Compton scattered electrons. The robust baseline\ntechnology for the Compton polarimeters foreseen at future linear colliders is\nbased on an array of gas Cherenkov detectors read out by photomultipliers. In\nthis paper, we will present a calibration method which promises to monitor\nnonlinearities in the response of such a detector at the level of a few\npermille. This method has been implemented in an LED-based calibration system\nwhich matches the existing prototype detector. The performance of this\ncalibration system is sufficient to control the corresponding contribution to\nthe total uncertainty on the extracted polarisation to better than $0.1\\%$.\n", "  The phenomenological analysis of the LHC data on transverse momentum spectrum\nand elliptic flow of $J/\\psi$ and D mesons in PbPb collisions at center-of-mass\nenergy 2.76 TeV per nucleon pair is presented. The charmed meson production\npattern in PbPb collisions may be reproduced by two-component model HYDJET++\nincluding thermal and non-thermal components. The significant part of D-mesons\nis found to be in a kinetic equilibrium with the created medium, while\n$J/\\psi$-mesons are not.\n", "  We study theoretically the effective spin Hall properties of a composite\nconsisting of two materials with and without spin-orbit (SO) coupling. In\nparticular, we assume that SO material represents a system of grains in a\nmatrix with no SO. We calculate the effective spin Hall angle and the effective\nspin diffusion length of the mixture. Our main qualitative finding is that,\nwhen the bare spin diffusion length is much smaller than the radius of the\ngrain, the effective spin diffusion length is strongly enhanced, well beyond\nthe \"geometrical\" factor. The physical origin of this additional enhancement is\nthat, with small diffusion length, the spin current mostly flows around the\ngrain without suffering much loss. We also demonstrate that the voltage,\ncreated by a spin current, is sensitive to a very weak magnetic field directed\nalong the spin current, and even reverses sign in a certain domain of fields.\nThe origin of this sensitivity is that the spin precession, caused by magnetic\nfield, takes place outside the grains where SO is absent.\n", "  The cutoff dependence of the Casimir energy and stress is studied using the\nGreen's function method for a system that is piecewise-smoothly inhomogeneous\nalong one dimension. The asymptotic cylinder kernel expansions of the energy\nand stress are obtained, with some extra cutoff terms that are induced by the\ninhomogeneity. Introducing interfaces to the system one by one shows how those\ncutoff terms emerge and illuminates their physical interpretations. Based on\nthat, we propose a subtraction scheme to address the problem of the remaining\ncutoff dependence in the Casimir stress in an inhomogeneous medium, and show\nthat the nontouching Casimir force between two separated bodies is cutoff\nindependent. The cancellation of the electric and magnetic contributions to the\nsurface divergence near a perfectly conducting wall is found to be incomplete\nin the case of inhomogeneity.\n", "  This paper shows that, a quasi-localization of wavefunctions in toroidal\ncompactifications with magnetic fluxes can lead to a strong suppression for\nrelevant Yukawa couplings, and it is applicable to obtain tiny neutrino masses.\nAlthough it is known that magnetic fluxes lead to a Gaussian profile of\nzero-modes on a torus and that can yield a suppressed coupling in\nhigher-dimensional supersymmetric Yang-Mills (SYM) theories, the largest\n(diagonal) entry of Yukawa matrices is always of $\\mathcal O(1)$. In this\npaper, we propose a way to induce an absolutely tiny global factor of Yukawa\nmatrices. In two SYM theories defined in different dimensional spacetime, their\nbifundamental representations must be localized as a point in some directions.\nOverlaps of such point-like localized wavefunctions and Gaussian zero-modes\ngive a global factor of Yukawa matrices, and it can be a strong suppression\nfactor or a usual $\\mathcal O(1)$ factor, corresponding to their distance. Our\nnumerical analysis shows that it is possible to obtain a suppression strong\nenough to realize the tiny neutrino masses without a hard fine-tuning.\nFurthermore, we propose a concrete model of the tiny neutrino Yukawa couplings\nin a magnetized SYM system.\n", "  Ozawa et. al [1] presented numerical results for the configurational entropy\ndensity, $s_c$, of a model glass-forming liquid in the presence of random\npinning. The location of a \"phase boundary\" in the pin density ($c$) -\ntemperature ($T$) plane, that separates an \"ideal glass\" phase from the\nsupercooled liquid phase, is obtained by finding the points at which $s_c(T,c)\n\\to 0$. According to the theoretical arguments by Cammarota et. al. [2], an\nideal glass transition at which the $\\alpha$-relaxation time $\\tau_\\alpha$\ndiverges takes place when $s_c$ goes to zero. We have studied the dynamics of\nthe same system using molecular dynamics simulations. We have calculated the\ntime-dependence of the self intermediate scattering function, $F_s(k,t)$ at\nthree state points in the $(c-T)$ plane where $s_c(T,c) \\simeq 0$ according to\nRef. [1]. It is clear from the plots that the relaxation time is finite\n[$\\tau_\\alpha \\sim \\mathcal{O}(10^6)]$ at these state points. Similar\nconclusions have been obtained in Ref.[3] where an overlap function was used to\ncalculate $\\tau_\\alpha$ at these state points.\n", "  Reply to the preceding letter by Chakrabarty et al. [Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci.\nUSA, 112, no. 35, E4818-E4820 (2015)].\n", "  This proceeding briefly summarizes our recent VISHNU hybrid model\ninvestigations on the chemical and thermal freeze-out of various hadrons\nspecies in 2.76 A TeV Pb+Pb collisions. Detailed analysis on the evolution of\nparticle yields and the last elastic collisions distributions during the\nhadronic evolution reveals that the two multi-strange hadrons, $\\Xi$ and\n$\\Omega$, experience early chemical and thermal freeze-out when compared with\nother hadron species.\n", "  We present quantum Monte Carlo calculations of light nuclei, neutron-$\\alpha$\nscattering, and neutron matter using local two- and three-nucleon ($3N$)\ninteractions derived from chiral effective field theory up to\nnext-to-next-to-leading order (N$^2$LO). The two undetermined $3N$ low-energy\ncouplings are fit to the $^4$He binding energy and, for the first time, to the\nspin-orbit splitting in the neutron-$\\alpha$ $P$-wave phase shifts.\nFurthermore, we investigate different choices of local $3N$-operator structures\nand find that chiral interactions at N$^2$LO are able to simultaneously\nreproduce the properties of $A=3,4,5$ systems and of neutron matter, in\ncontrast to commonly used phenomenological $3N$ interactions.\n", "  The cosmological relaxation mechanism proposed in [1] allows for a\ndynamically generated large separation between the weak scale and a theory\ncutoff, using a sharp change of theory behaviour upon crossing the limit\nbetween unbroken and broken symmetry phases. In this note we present a\nvariation of this scenario, in which stabilization of the electroweak scale in\nthe right place is ensured by the $Z_2$ symmetry exchanging the Standard Model\n(SM) with its mirror copy. We sketch the possible ways to produce viable\nthermal evolution of the Universe and discuss experimental accessibility of the\nnew physics effects. We show that in this scenario the mirror SM can either\nhave sizeable couplings with the ordinary one, or, conversely, can interact\nwith it with a negligible strength. The overall cutoff allowed by such a\nconstruction can reach $10^9$ GeV.\n", "  In this work I briefly review some of the effects of hyperons on the\nproperties of neutron and proto-neutron stars. In particular, I revise the\nproblem of the strong softening of the EoS, and the consequent reduction of the\nmaximum mass, induced by the presence of hyperons, a puzzle which has become\nmore intringuing and difficult to solve due the recent measurements of the\nunusually high masses of the millisecond pulsars PSR J1903+0327 ($1.667\\pm\n0.021 M_\\odot$), PSR J1614-2230 ($1.97 \\pm 0.04 M_\\odot$), and PSR J0348+0432\n($2.01 \\pm 0.04 M_\\odot$). Some of the solutions proposed to tackle this\nproblem are discussed. Finally, I re-examine also the role of hyperons on the\ncooling properties of newly born neutron stars and on the so-called r-mode\ninstability.\n", "  The longitudinal spin Seebeck effect (LSSE) has been investigated in\nhigh-quality epitaxial CoFe2O4 (CFO) thin films. The thermally excited spin\ncurrents in the CFO films are electrically detected in adjacent Pt layers due\nto the inverse spin Hall effect (ISHE). The LSSE signal exhibits a linear\nincrease with increasing temperature gradient, yielding a LSSE coefficient of\n~100 nV/K at room temperature. The temperature dependence of the LSSE is\ninvestigated from room temperature down to 30 K, showing a significant\nreduction at low temperatures, revealing that the total amount of thermally\ngenerated magnons decreases. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the spin Seebeck\neffect is an effective tool to study the magnetic anisotropy induced by\nepitaxial strain, especially in ultrathin films with low magnetic moments.\n", "  The experimental realization of lattices with Chern bands in ultracold-atom\nand photonic systems has motivated the study of time-dependent phenomena, such\nas spatial propagation, in lattices with nontrivial topology. We study the\ndynamics of gaussian wavepackets on the Haldane honeycomb Chern-band lattice\nmodel, in the presence of a harmonic trap. We focus on the transverse response\nto a force, which is due partly to the Berry curvature and partly to the\ntransverse component of the energy band curvature. We evaluate the accuracy of\na semiclassical description, which treats the wavepacket as a point particle in\nboth real and momentum space, in reproducing the motion of a realistic\nwavepacket with finite extent. We find that, in order to accurately capture the\nwavepacket dynamics, the extent of the wavepacket in momentum space needs to be\ntaken into account. The dynamics is sensitive to the interplay of band\ndispersion and Berry curvature over the finite region of momentum (reciprocal)\nspace where the wavepacket has support. Moreover, if the wavepacket is prepared\nwith a finite initial momentum, the semiclassical analysis reproduces its\nmotion as long as it has a large overlap with the eigenstates of a single band.\nThe semiclassical description generally improves with increasing real-space\nsize of the wavepacket, as long as the external conditions (e.g., external\nforce) remain uniform throughout the spatial extent of the wavepacket.\n", "  We discuss recent progress in the study of in-medium heavy quarkonium using\nfirst-principles lattice QCD calculations and effective field theory. In\nparticular our focus lies on real-time information carried by QCD spectral\nfunctions and we report on a novel strategy for their extraction from\nEuclidean-time simulations. Combining an effective description for heavy quarks\nwith finite temperature lattice QCD we compute in-medium spectra providing\ninsight in heavy quarkonium melting in a static thermal medium. On the other\nhand we use spectral information to extract the complex in-medium potential\nwhich provides the basis for a dynamical description of quarkonium real-time\nevolution via the Schr\\\"odinger equation.\n", "  High resolution coherent nonlinear optical spectroscopy of an ensemble of\nred-emitting InGaN quantum dots in GaN nanowires is reported. The data show a\npronounced atom-like interaction between resonant laser fields and quantum dot\nexcitons at low temperature that is difficult to observe in the linear\nabsorption spectrum due to inhomogeneous broadening from indium fluctuation\neffects. We find that the nonlinear signal persists strongly at room\ntemperature. The robust atom-like room temperature response indicates the\npossibility that this material could serve as the platform for proposed\nexcitonic based applications without the need of cryogenics.\n", "  In the paper we investigate three novel rising submillimeter (THz) bursts\noccurred sequentially in a super-Active Region NOAA 10486. The average rising\nrate of the flux density above 200 GHz is only 20 sfu/GHz (corresponding\nspectral index $\\alpha$ of 1.6) for the THz spectral components of 2003 October\n28 and November 4 bursts, while it can attain values of 235 sfu/GHz\n($\\alpha$=4.8) for 2003 November 2 burst. The steeply rising THz spectrum can\nbe produced by a population of high relativistic electrons with a low-energy\ncutoff of 1 MeV , while it only requires a low-energy cutoff of 30 keV for the\ntwo slowly rising THz bursts, via gyrosynchrotron (GS) radiation based on our\nnumerical simulations of burst spectra in the magnetic dipole field case. The\nelectron density variation is much larger in the THz source than that in\nmicrowave (MW) one. It is interesting that the THz source radius decreased by\n20--50$\\%$ during the decay phase for the three events, but the MW one\nincreased by 28$\\%$ for the 2003 November 2 event. In the paper we will present\na calculation formula of energy released by ultrarelativistic electrons,\naccounting the relativistic correction for the first time. We find that the\nenergy released by energetic electrons in the THz source exceeds that in\nmicrowave one due to the strong GS radiation loss at THz range, although the\nmodeled THz source area is 3--4 orders smaller than the modeled MW one. The\ntotal energies released by energetic electrons via the GS radiation in radio\nsources are estimated, respectively, to be $5.2\\times10^{33}$,\n$3.9\\times10^{33}$ and $3.7\\times10^{32}$ erg for the October 28, November 2\nand 4 bursts, which are 131, 76 and 4 times as large as the thermal energies of\n$2.9\\times10^{31}$, $2.1\\times10^{31}$ and $5.2\\times10^{31}$ erg estimated\nfrom the soft x-ray GOES observations.\n", "  In this paper, we point out and study a generic type of signals existing in\nthe primordial universe models, which can be used to model-independently\ndistinguish the inflation scenario from alternatives. These signals are\ngenerated by massive fields that function as standard clocks. The role of\nmassive fields as standard clocks has been realized in previous works. Although\nthe existence of such massive fields is generic, the previous realizations\nrequire sharp features to classically excite the oscillations of the massive\nclock fields. Here, we point out that the quantum fluctuations of massive\nfields can actually serve the same purpose as the standard clocks. We show that\nthey are also able to directly record the defining property of the scenario\ntype, namely, the scale factor of the primordial universe as a function of time\na(t), but through shape-dependent oscillatory features in non-Gaussianities.\nSince quantum fluctuating massive fields exist in any realistic primordial\nuniverse models, these quantum primordial standard clock signals are present in\nany inflation models, and should exist quite generally in\nalternative-to-inflation scenarios as well. However, the amplitude of such\nsignals is very model-dependent.\n", "  We have been investigating the difficulties that students in upper-level\nundergraduate courses have in determining the probability distribution for\nmeasuring energy and position as a function of time when the initial wave\nfunction is explicitly given. We administered written free-response and\nmultiple-choice questions to investigate these difficulties. We find that\nstudents have common difficulties with these concepts. We discuss some of the\nfindings.\n", "  We administered written free-response and multiple-choice questions and\nconducted individual interviews to investigate the difficulties that\nupper-level undergraduate and graduate students have with quantum states while\ntranslating state vectors in Dirac notation to wave functions in position and\nmomentum representations. We find that students share common difficulties with\ntranslating a state vector written in Dirac notation to the wave function in\nposition or momentum representation.\n", "  We report measurements of the in-plane magnetoelastic coupling in ultra-thin\nTa|CoFeB|MgO layers as a function of uniaxial strain, conducted using a\nfour-point bending apparatus. For annealed samples, we observe a strong\ndependence on the thickness of the CoFeB layer in the range 1.3-2.0 nm, which\ncan be modeled as arising from a combination of effective surface and volume\ncontributions to the magnetoelastic coupling. We point out that if similar\nthickness dependence exists for magnetoelastic coupling in response to biaxial\nstrain, then the standard N\\'eel model for the magnetic anisotropy energy\nacquires a term inversely proportional to the magnetic layer thickness. This\ncontribution can significantly change the overall magnetic anisotropy, and\nprovides a natural explanation for the strongly nonlinear dependence of\nmagnetic anisotropy energy on magnetic layer thickness that is commonly\nobserved for ultrathin annealed CoFeB|MgO films with perpendicular magnetic\nanisotropy.\n", "  Observations from multiple spacecraft show that there are energy spectral\n\"breaks\" at 1-10MeV in some large CME-driven shocks. However, numerical models\ncan hardly simulate this property due to high computational expense. The\npresent paper focuses on analyzing these energy spectral \"breaks\" by Monte\nCarlo particle simulations of an isolated CME-driven shock. Taking the Dec 14\n2006 CME-driven shock as an example, we investigate the formation of this\nenergy spectral property. For this purpose, we apply different values for the\nscattering time in our isolated shock model to obtain the highest energy\n\"tails\", which can potentially exceed the \"break\" energy range. However, we\nhave not found the highest energy \"tails\" beyond the \"break\" energy range, but\ninstead find that the highest energy \"tails\" reach saturation near the range of\nenergy at 5MeV. So, we believe that there exists an energy spectral \"cut off\"\nin an isolated shock. If there is no interaction with another shock, there\nwould not be formation of the energy spectral \"break\" property.\n", "  Measurements of the redshift-space galaxy clustering have been a prolific\nsource of cosmological information in recent years. Accurate covariance\nestimates are an essential step for the validation of galaxy clustering models\nof the redshift-space two-point statistics. Usually, only a limited set of\naccurate N-body simulations is available. Thus, assessing the data covariance\nis not possible or only leads to a noisy estimate. Further, relying on\nsimulated realisations of the survey data means that tests of the cosmology\ndependence of the covariance are expensive. With these points in mind, this\nwork presents a simple theoretical model for the linear covariance of\nanisotropic galaxy clustering observations with synthetic catalogues.\nConsidering the Legendre moments (`multipoles') of the two-point statistics and\nprojections into wide bins of the line-of-sight parameter (`clustering\nwedges'), we describe the modelling of the covariance for these anisotropic\nclustering measurements for galaxy samples with a trivial geometry in the case\nof a Gaussian approximation of the clustering likelihood. As main result of\nthis paper, we give the explicit formulae for Fourier and configuration space\ncovariance matrices. To validate our model, we create synthetic HOD galaxy\ncatalogues by populating the haloes of an ensemble of large-volume N-body\nsimulations. Using linear and non-linear input power spectra, we find very good\nagreement between the model predictions and the measurements on the synthetic\ncatalogues in the quasi-linear regime.\n", "  We report the discovery of an excess of main sequence turn-off stars in the\ndirection of the constellations of Eridanus and Phoenix from the first year\ndata of the Dark Energy Survey (DES). The Eridanus-Phoenix (EriPhe) overdensity\nis centered around l~285 deg and b~-60 deg and spans at least 30 deg in\nlongitude and 10 deg in latitude. The Poisson significance of the detection is\nat least 9 sigma. The stellar population in the overdense region is similar in\nbrightness and color to that of the nearby globular cluster NGC 1261,\nindicating that the heliocentric distance of EriPhe is about d~16 kpc. The\nextent of EriPhe in projection is therefore at least ~4 kpc by ~3 kpc. On the\nsky, this overdensity is located between NGC 1261 and a new stellar stream\ndiscovered by DES at a similar heliocentric distance, the so-called Phoenix\nStream. Given their similar distance and proximity to each other, it is\npossible that these three structures may be kinematically associated.\nAlternatively, the EriPhe overdensity is morphologically similar to the Virgo\noverdensity and the Hercules-Aquila cloud, which also lie at a similar\nGalactocentric distance. These three overdensities lie along a polar plane\nseparated by ~120 deg and may share a common origin. Spectroscopic follow-up\nobservations of the stars in EriPhe are required to fully understand the nature\nof this overdensity.\n", "  Phenomena originated from spin-orbit interaction, such as magnetic anisotropy\n(MA), Rashba-type interactions, or topological insulators, have drawn huge\nattention for its intriguing physics. In particular, the search for a novel\nantiferromagnetic material, with potentially large perpendicular MA (PMA), has\nbeen becoming very intensive for next-generation high density memory\napplications. Here, we propose that substitutions of transition metals Ru and\nIr, neighboring and same group elements in the periodic table, for the Rh site\nin the vicinity of surface can induce a substantially large PMA, up to an order\nof magnitude of 20 erg/cm2, in FeRh films on MgO. The main driving mechanism\nfor this huge PMA is the interplay between the dxy and dx2-y2 states of strong\nspin-orbit 4d and 5d orbitals. Further investigations demonstrate that\nmagnetization direction of PMA undergoes a transition into an in-plane\nmagnetization at the antiferromagnetic-to-ferromagnetic phase transition, which\nprovides a viable route for achieving large and switchable PMA associated with\nthe magnetic-phase transition in antiferromagnetic spintronics.\n", "  The production and dynamics of strange and antistrange hadrons in heavy-ion\nreactions from $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} \\approx$ 3 GeV to 200 GeV is analyzed within the\nParton-Hadron-String-Dynamics (PHSD) transport model. The PHSD results for\nstrange baryon and antibaryon production are roughly consistent with the\nexperimental data starting from upper SPS energies. Nevertheless, hadronic\nfinal state flavor-exchange reactions are important for the actual abundances,\nin particular at large rapidities where hadronic dynamics, parton fragmentation\nand string decay dominate. A striking disagreement between the PHSD results and\nthe available data persists, however, for bombarding energies below\n$\\sqrt{s_{NN}} \\approx$ 8 GeV where the strangeness production is significantly\nunderestimated as in earlier HSD studies. This finding implies that the\nstrangeness enhancement seen experimentally at FAIR/NICA energies cannot be\nattributed to a deconfinement phase transition or crossover but probably\ninvolves the approximate restoration of chiral symmetry in the hadronic phase.\n", "  We analyze $^{16}$O-$^{16}$O and $^{12}$C-$^{12}$C scattering with the\nmicroscopic coupled-channels method and investigate the coupled-channels and\nthree-nucleon-force (3NF) effects on elastic and inelastic cross sections. In\nthe microscopic coupled-channels calculation, the Melbourne g-matrix\ninteraction modified according to the chiral 3NF effects is used. It is found\nthat the coupled-channels and 3NF effects additively change both the elastic\nand inelastic cross sections. As a result, the coupled-channels calculation\nincluding the 3NF effects significantly improves the agreement between the\ntheoretical results and the experimental data. The incident-energy dependence\nof the coupled-channels and 3NF effects is also discussed.\n", "  Despite being a paradigm of quantitative linguistics, Zipf's law for words\nsuffers from three main problems: its formulation is ambiguous, its validity\nhas not been tested rigorously from a statistical point of view, and it has not\nbeen confronted to a representatively large number of texts. So, we can\nsummarize the current support of Zipf's law in texts as anecdotic.\n  We try to solve these issues by studying three different versions of Zipf's\nlaw and fitting them to all available English texts in the Project Gutenberg\ndatabase (consisting of more than 30000 texts). To do so we use state-of-the\nart tools in fitting and goodness-of-fit tests, carefully tailored to the\npeculiarities of text statistics. Remarkably, one of the three versions of\nZipf's law, consisting of a pure power-law form in the complementary cumulative\ndistribution function of word frequencies, is able to fit more than 40% of the\ntexts in the database (at the 0.05 significance level), for the whole domain of\nfrequencies (from 1 to the maximum value) and with only one free parameter (the\nexponent).\n", "  In this paper, we consider the optimum coordinate of the penta-graphene.\nPenta-graphene is a new stable carbon allotrope which is stronger than\ngraphene. Here, we compare the band gap of penta-graphene with various density\nfunctional theory (DFT) methods. We plot the band structure of penta-graphene\nwhich calculated with the generalized gradient approximation functional, about\nFermi energy.\n", "  The formation of a hot deconfined medium (Quark-Gluon Plasma) in high-energy\nnuclear collisions affects heavy-flavor observables. In the low/moderate-pT\nrange transport calculations allow one to simulate the propagation of heavy\nquarks in the plasma and to evaluate the effect of the medium on the final\nhadronic spectra: results obtained with transport coefficients arising from\ndifferent theoretical approaches can be compared to experimental data. Finally,\na discussion of possible effects on heavy-flavor observables due to the\npossible formation of a hot-medium in small systems (like in p-A collisions) is\npresented.\n", "  We introduce a stochastic sandwich method with low-mode substitution to\nevaluate the connected three-point functions. The isovector matrix elements of\nthe nucleon for the axial-vector coupling $g_A^3$, scalar couplings $g_S^3$ and\nthe quark momentum fraction $\\langle x\\rangle_{u -d}$ are calculated with\noverlap fermion on 2+1 flavor domain-wall configurations on a $24^3 \\times 64$\nlattice at $m_{\\pi} = 330$ MeV with lattice spacing $a = 0.114$ fm.\n", "  We propose a water-immersed nucleobase-functionalized suspended graphene\nnanoribbon as an intrinsically selective device for nucleotide detection. The\nproposed sensing method combines Watson-Crick selective base pairing with\ngraphene's capacity for converting anisotropic lattice strain to changes in an\nelectrical current at the nanoscale. Using detailed atomistic molecular\ndynamics simulations, we study sensor operation at ambient conditions. We\ncombine simulated data with theoretical arguments to estimate the levels of\nmeasurable electrical signal variation in response to strains and determine\nthat the proposed sensing mechanism shows significant promise for realistic DNA\nsensing devices without the need for advanced data processing, or highly\nrestrictive operational conditions.\n", "  I formulate several statements demonstrating that the local metric\nredefinition can be used to reduce the UV divergences present in the quantum\naction for the Einstein gravity in $d=4$ dimensions. In its most general form,\nthe proposal is that any UV divergences in the quantum action can be removed by\nan appropriate field re-definition and a renormalization of cosmological\nconstant.\n", "  Dissipative preparation of a pure steady state usually involves a commutative\naction of a coherent and a dissipative dynamics on the target state. Namely,\nthe target pure state is an eigenstate of both the coherent and dissipative\nparts of the dynamics. We show that working in the Zeno regime, i.e. for\ninfinitely large dissipative coupling, one can generate a pure state by a non\ncommutative action, in the above sense, of the coherent and dissipative\ndynamics. A corresponding Zeno regime pureness criterion is derived. We\nillustrate the approach, looking at both its theoretical and applicative\naspects, in the example case of an open $XXZ$ spin-$1/2$ chain, driven out of\nequilibrium by boundary reservoirs targeting different spin orientations. Using\nour criterion, we find two families of pure nonequilibrium steady states, in\nthe Zeno regime, and calculate the dissipative strengths effectively needed to\ngenerate steady states which are almost indistinguishable from the target pure\nstates.\n", "  The classical models used for describing the behavior of woven fabrics do not\nfully account for the whole set of phenomena that occur during the testing of\nsuch materials. This lack of precision is mainly due to the absence of energy\nterms related to the microstructural properties of the fabric and, in\nparticular, to the bending stiffness of the yarns. In this paper it is shown\nthat in the unbalanced fabrics the different bending stiffnesses of the warp\nand weft yarns produce macroscopic effects that are extremely visible as, for\nexample, the asymmetric S-shape during a Bias Extension Test (BET).\n  We propose to introduce a constrained micromorphic model and a discrete model\nthat are able to account for i) the angle variation between warp and weft tows,\nii) the unbalance in the bending stiffness of the yarns and iii) the relative\nslipping of the tows.\n  The constrained micromorphic model is framed in the spirit of the Principle\nof Virtual Powers for the equilibrium of continuum bodies. A suitable\nconstraint is introduced by means of Lagrange multipliers in the strain\nenergydens ity and the resulting constrained model tends a particular second\ngradientone. The main advantage of using such constrained micromorphic model is\nthat the kinematical and traction boundary conditions that can be imposed on\nthe boundary of the considered body take a natural and unique meaning.\n  The discrete model is set up by opportunely interconnecting Euler-Bernoulli\nbeams with different bending stiffnesses in the two directions by means of\nrotational and translational elastic springs. The main advantage of such\ndiscrete model is that the slipping of the tows is described in a rather\nrealistic way. Suitable numerical simulations are presented for both the\ncontinuum and the discrete models and a comparison between the simulations and\nthe experimental results is made showing a definitely good agreement.\n", "  For interdependent networks with identity dependency map, percolation is\nexactly the same with that on a single network and follows a second-order phase\ntransition, while for random dependency, percolation follows a first-order\nphase transition. In real networks, the dependency relations between networks\nare neither identical nor completely random. Thus in this paper, we study the\ninfluence of randomness for dependency maps on the robustness of interdependent\nlattice networks. We introduce approximate entropy($ApEn$) as the measure of\nrandomness of the dependency maps. We find that there is critical $ApEn_c$\nbelow which the percolation is continuous, but for larger $ApEn$, it is a\nfirst-order transition. With the increment of $ApEn$, the $p_c$ increases until\n$ApEn$ reaching ${ApEn}_c'$ and then remains almost constant. The time scale of\nthe system shows rich properties as $ApEn$ increases. Our results uncover that\nrandomness is one of the important factors that lead to cascading failures of\nspatially interdependent networks.\n", "  The experimental data on p, Lambda, Xi-, Omega-, baryons and the\ncorresponding antibaryons spectra obtained by different collaborations are\ncompared with the results of the calculations performed into the frame of the\nQuark-Gluon String Model. The contribution of String Junction diffusion and the\ninelastic screening corrections are accounted for in the theoretical\ncalculations. The predictions of the Quark-Gluon String Model both for pp and\npA collisions are extended up to the LHC energies.\n", "  We study absorbing-state phase transitions in two-dimensional\nVoronoi-Delaunay (VD) random lattices with quenched coordination disorder.\nQuenched randomness usually changes the criticality and destroys discontinuous\ntransitions in low-dimensional nonequilibrium systems. We performed extensive\nsimulations of the Ziff-Gulari-Barshad (ZGB) model, and verified that the VD\ndisorder does not change the nature of its discontinuous transition. Our\nresults corroborate recent findings of Barghatti and Vojta [Phys. Rev. Lett.\n{\\bf 113}, 120602 (2014)] stating the irrelevance of topological disorder in a\nclass of random lattices that includes VD and raise the interesting possibility\nthat disorder in nonequilibrium APT may, under certain conditions, be\nirrelevant for the phase coexistence. We also verify that the VD disorder is\nirrelevant for the critical behavior of models belonging to the directed\npercolation and Manna universality classes.\n", "  Both color screening and regeneration are hot medium effects on charmonium\nproduction in heavy ion collisions. While they affect in an opposite way the\ncharmonium yield, their competition in transverse dynamics bring sensitivity to\nthe ratio of averaged transverse momentum suqare for charmonium, which thus can\nreveal more nature of the QCD medium created from the collisions. We make an\nexcitation analysis based on transport approach to illustrate such a picuture.\n", "  We define a notion of logarithmic, Coulomb and Riesz interactions in any\ndimension for random systems of infinite charged point configurations with a\nuniform background of opposite sign. We connect this interaction energy with\nthe \"renormalized energy\" studied by Serfaty et al., which appears in the free\nenergy functional governing the microscopic behavior of logarithmic, Coulomb\nand Riesz gases. Minimizers of this functional include the Sine-beta processes\nin the one-dimensional Log-gas case. Using our explicit expression (inspired by\nthe work of Borodin-Serfaty) we prove their convergence to the Poisson process\nin the high-temperature limit as well as a crystallization result in the\nlow-temperature limit for one-dimensional systems.\n", "  We present a minimal statistical model designed for the description of\nrare-hadron multiplicities in nucleus-nucleus collisions at energies below the\nthreshold of the particle production in binary elementary collisions.\nDifferences to more conventional canonical statistical model are explained. The\nminimal statistical model is applied to the description of multiplicity ratios\ninvolving $\\Xi$ hyperons, which are measured by the HADES collaboration at\nGSI-SIS. It is argued that the HADES data cannot be reproduced by the model\nbased on the statistical equilibrium and the strangeness conservation. The data\nremain underpredicted even when in-medium potentials acting on hadrons are\ntaken into account. This hints to non-equilibrium production of the $\\Xi$\nhyperons and their continuous freeze-out.\n", "  We report our results for the freeze-out temperature and transverse flow\nprofile obtained from fits to hadronic spectra measured by the ALICE\ncollaboration. The influence of resonance decays is important and cannot be\nsimply accounted for without the inclusion of their decays into the fits.\n", "  The value of the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ in the region allowed by the\nlatest $Planck$ 2015 measurements can be associated to a large variety of\ninflationary models. We discuss here the potential of future Cosmic Microwave\nBackground cosmological observations in disentangling among the possible\ntheoretical scenarios allowed by our analyses of current $Planck$ temperature\nand polarization data. Rather than focusing only on $r$, we focus as well on\nthe running of the primordial power spectrum, $\\alpha_s$ and the running of\nthereof, $\\beta_s$. Our Fisher matrix method benefits from a detailed and\nrealistic appraisal of the expected foregrounds. Future cosmological probes, as\nthe COrE mission, may be able to reach an unprecedented accuracy in the\nextraction of $\\beta_s$ and rule out the most favoured inflationary models.\n", "  The spin-momentum locked nature of the robust surface states of three\ndimensional topological insulators (3D TI) make them promising candidates for\nspintronics applications. Surface potentials which respect time reversal\nsymmetry can exist at the surface between a 3D TI and the trivial vacuum. These\npotentials can distort the spin texture of the surface states while retaining\ntheir gapless nature. In this work, the effect of all such surface potentials\non the spin textures is studied. Since, a tunnel magnetoresistance signal\ncarries the information of the spin texture, it is proposed that spin-polarized\ntunneling of electrons to a 3D TI surface can be used to uniquely identify the\nsurface potentials and quantitatively characterize them.\n", "  Discrete fine-scale models, in the form of either particle or lattice models,\nhave been formulated successfully to simulate the behavior of quasi-brittle\nmaterials whose mechanical behavior is inherently connected to fracture\nprocesses occurring in the internal heterogeneous structure. These models tend\nto be intensive from the computational point of view as they adopt an a priori\ndiscretization anchored to the major material heterogeneities (e.g. grains in\nparticulate materials and aggregate pieces in cementitious composites) and this\nhampers their use in the numerical simulations of large systems. In this work,\nthis problem is addressed by formulating a general multiple scale computational\nframework based on classical asymptotic analysis and that (1) is applicable to\nany discrete model with rotational degrees of freedom; and (2) gives rise to an\nequivalent Cosserat continuum. The developed theory is applied to the upscaling\nof the Lattice Discrete Particle Model (LDPM), a recently formulated discrete\nmodel for concrete and other quasi-brittle materials, and the properties of the\nhomogenized model are analyzed thoroughly in both the elastic and inelastic\nregime. The analysis shows that the homogenized micropolar elastic properties\nare size-dependent, and they are functions of the RVE size and the size of the\nmaterial heterogeneity. Furthermore, the analysis of the homogenized inelastic\nbehavior highlights issues associated with the homogenization of fine-scale\nmodels featuring strain-softening and the related damage localization. Finally,\nnonlinear simulations of the RVE behavior subject to curvature components\ncausing bending and torsional effects demonstrates, contrarily to typical\nCosserat formulations, a significant coupling between the homogenized\nstress-strain and couple-curvature constitutive equations.\n", "  Using VISHNU hybrid model, we calculate the $p_{\\rm T}$-spectra and elliptic\nflow of $\\Lambda$, $\\Xi$, and $\\Omega$ in 200 A GeV Au+Au collisions.\nComparisons with the STAR measurements show that the model generally describes\nthese soft hadron data. We also briefly study and discuss the mass ordering of\nelliptic flow among $\\pi$, $K$, $p$, $\\Lambda$, $\\Xi$, and $\\Omega$ in minimum\nbias Au+Au collisions.\n", "  The controlled growth of organic layer on surface is still awaiting for an\non-line reliable monitoring that would allow improvement of its quality. We\nshow here that the self-assembly of the perylene monolayer deposited on Ag(110)\nat room temperature can be tracked with low energy atoms in a regime where the\nenergy perpendicular to the layer is less than 0.1 eV preventing damage to the\nlayer. The image processing required for this triangulation technique with\natoms is described in details.\n", "  Numerical models are powerful tools to predict the electromagnetic behavior\nof superconductors. In recent years, a variety of models have been successfully\ndeveloped to simulate high-temperature-superconducting (HTS) coated conductor\ntapes. While the models work well for the simulation of individual tapes or\nrelatively small assemblies, their direct applicability to devices involving\nhundreds or thousands of tapes, as for example coils used in electrical\nmachines, is questionable. Indeed the simulation time and memory requirement\ncan quickly become prohibitive. In this article, we develop and compare two\ndifferent models for simulating realistic HTS devices composed of a large\nnumber of tapes: 1) the homogenized model simulates the coil using an\nequivalent anisotropic homogeneous bulk with specifically developed current\nconstraints to account for the fact that each turn carries the same current; 2)\nthe multi-scale model parallelizes and reduces the computational problem by\nsimulating only several individual tapes at significant positions of the coil's\ncross-section using appropriate boundary conditions to account for the field\ngenerated by the neighboring turns. Both methods are used to simulate a coil\nmade of 2000 tapes, and compared against the widely used H-formulation finite\nelement model that includes all the tapes. Both approaches allow speeding-up\nsimulations of large number of HTS tapes by 1-3 orders of magnitudes, while\nkeeping a good accuracy of the results. Such models could be used to design and\noptimize large-scale HTS devices.\n", "  The SDSS-IV/eBOSS has an extensive quasar program that combines several\nselection methods. Among these, the photometric variability technique provides\nhighly uniform samples, unaffected by the redshift bias of traditional\noptical-color selections, when $z= 2.7 - 3.5$ quasars cross the stellar locus\nor when host galaxy light affects quasar colors at $z < 0.9$. Here, we present\nthe variability selection of quasars in eBOSS, focusing on a specific program\nthat led to a sample of 13,876 quasars to $g_{\\rm dered}=22.5$ over a 94.5\ndeg$^2$ region in Stripe 82, an areal density 1.5 times higher than over the\nrest of the eBOSS footprint. We use these variability-selected data to provide\na new measurement of the quasar luminosity function (QLF) in the redshift range\n$0.68<z<4.0$. Our sample is denser, reaches deeper than those used in previous\nstudies of the QLF, and is among the largest ones. At the faint end, our QLF\nextends to $M_g(z\\!=\\!2)=-21.80$ at low redshift and to $M_g(z\\!=\\!2)=-26.20$\nat $z\\sim 4$. We fit the QLF using two independent double-power-law models with\nten free parameters each. The first model is a pure luminosity-function\nevolution (PLE) with bright-end and faint-end slopes allowed to be different on\neither side of $z=2.2$. The other is a simple PLE at $z<2.2$, combined with a\nmodel that comprises both luminosity and density evolution (LEDE) at $z>2.2$.\nBoth models are constrained to be continuous at $z=2.2$. They present a\nflattening of the bright-end slope at large redshift. The LEDE model indicates\na reduction of the break density with increasing redshift, but the evolution of\nthe break magnitude depends on the parameterization. The models are in\nexcellent accord, predicting quasar counts that agree within 0.3\\% (resp.,\n1.1\\%) to $g<22.5$ (resp., $g<23$). The models are also in good agreement over\nthe entire redshift range with models from previous studies.\n", "  In this paper, we provide a more accurate description of the evolution of the\nmagnetic flux redistribution during prestellar core collapse by including\nresistive terms in the magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations. We focus more\nparticularly on the impact of ambipolar diffusion. We use the adaptive mesh\nrefinement code RAMSES to carry out such calculations. The resistivities\nrequired to calculate the ambipolar diffusion terms were computed using a\nreduced chemical network of charged, neutral and grain species. The inclusion\nof ambipolar diffusion leads to the formation of a magnetic diffusion barrier\nin the vicinity of the core, preventing accumulation of magnetic flux in and\naround the core and amplification of the field above 0.1G. The mass and radius\nof the first Larson core remain similar between ideal and non-ideal MHD models.\nThis diffusion plateau has crucial consequences on magnetic braking processes,\nallowing the formation of disk structures. Magnetically supported outflows\nlaunched in ideal MHD models are weakened when using non-ideal MHD. Contrary to\nideal MHD misalignment between the initial rotation axis and the magnetic field\ndirection does not significantly affect the results for a given mu, showing\nthat the physical dissipation truly dominate over numerical diffusion. We\ndemonstrate severe limits of the ideal MHD formalism, which yield unphysical\nbehaviours in the long-term evolution of the system. This includes counter\nrotation inside the outflow, interchange instabilities, and flux redistribution\ntriggered by numerical diffusion, none observed in non-ideal MHD. Disks with\nKeplerian velocity profiles form in all our non-ideal MHD simulations, with\nfinal mass and size which depend on the initial magnetisation. This ranges from\na few 0.01 solar masses and 20-30 au for the most magnetised case (mu=2) to 0.2\nsolar masses and 40-80 au for a lower magnetisation (mu=5).\n", "  We study Lorentzian manifolds with a weight function such that the\n$N$-Bakry-\\'Emery tensor is bounded below. Such spacetimes arise in the physics\nof scalar-tensor gravitation theories, including Brans-Dicke theory, theories\nwith Kaluza-Klein dimensional reduction, and low-energy approximations to\nstring theory. In the \"pure Bakry-\\'Emery\" $N= \\infty$ case with $f$ uniformly\nbounded above and initial data suitably bounded, cosmological-type singularity\ntheorems are known, as are splitting theorems which determine the geometry of\ntimelike geodesically complete spacetimes for which the bound on the initial\ndata is borderline violated. We extend these results in a number of ways. We\nare able to extend the singularity theorems to finite $N$-values $N\\in\n(n,\\infty)$ and $N\\in (-\\infty,1]$. In the $N\\in (n,\\infty)$ case, no bound on\n$f$ is required, while for $N\\in (-\\infty,1]$ and $N= \\infty$, we are able to\nreplace the boundedness of $f$ by a weaker condition on the integral of $f$\nalong future-inextendible timelike geodesics. The splitting theorems extend\nsimilarly, but when $N=1$ the splitting is only that of a warped product for\nall cases considered. A similar limited loss of rigidity has been observed in\nprior work on the $N$-Bakry-\\'Emery curvature in Riemannian signature when\n$N=1$, and appears to be a general feature.\n", "  The Hirsch's $h$-index is perhaps the most popular citation-based measure of\nthe scientific excellence. In 2013 G. Ionescu and B. Chopard proposed an\nagent-based model for this index to describe a publications and citations\ngeneration process in an abstract scientific community. With such an approach\none can simulate a single scientist's activity, and by extension investigate\nthe whole community of researchers. Even though this approach predicts quite\nwell the $h$-index from bibliometric data, only a solution based on simulations\nwas given. In this paper, we complete their results with exact, analytic\nformulas. What is more, due to our exact solution we are able to simplify the\nIonescu-Chopard model which allows us to obtain a compact formula for\n$h$-index. Moreover, a simulation study designed to compare both, approximated\nand exact, solutions is included. The last part of this paper presents\nevaluation of the obtained results on a real-word data set.\n", "  We calculate dilepton spectra in heavy-ion collisions using a coarse-graining\napproach to the simulation of the created medium with the UrQMD transport\nmodel. This enables the use of dilepton-production rates evaluated in\nequilibrium quantum-field theory at finite temperatures and chemical\npotentials.\n", "  Active matter such as swarming bacteria and motile colloids exhibits exotic\nproperties different from conventional equilibrium materials. Among these\nproperties, the enhanced diffusion of tracer particles is generally deemed as a\nhallmark of active matter. Here, rather than spherical tracers, we investigate\nthe diffusion of isolated ellipsoids in quasi-two-dimensional bacterial bath.\nOur study reveals a nonlinear enhancement of both translational and rotational\ndiffusions. More importantly, we uncover an anomalous coupling between\ntranslation and rotation that is strictly prohibited in the classic Brownian\ndiffusion. Combining experiments with theoretical modeling, we show that such\nan anomaly arises from generic stretching flows induced by swimming bacteria.\nOur work illustrates a universal organizing principle of active matter and\nsheds new light on fundamental transport processes in microbiological systems.\n", "  By using a propagation scheme for current matrices and an auxiliary mode\nexpansion method, we investigate the transient dynamics of a single molecular\njunction coupled with a vibrational mode. Our approach is based on the\nAnderson-Holstein model and the dressed tunneling approximation for the\nelectronic self-energy in the polaronic regime. The time-dependent currents\nafter a sudden switching on the tunneling to leads and an abrupt upward step\nbias pulse are calculated. We show that the strong electron-phonon interaction\ngreatly influences the nonlinear response properties of the system, and gives\nrise to interesting characteristics on the time traces of transient currents.\n", "  We study the rare semileptonic decays of $B$ mesons induced by $b \\to s \\nu\n\\bar{\\nu}$ as well as $b \\to s l^+ l^-$ transitions in the scalar leptoquark\nmodel where the leptoquarks transform as $(3,2,7/6)$ and $(3,2,1/6)$ under the\nstandard model gauge group. The leptoquark parameter space is constrained using\nthe most recent experimental results on ${\\rm Br}(B_s \\rightarrow \\mu^+ \\mu^-)$\nand ${\\rm Br}(B_d \\to X_s \\mu^+ \\mu^-)$ processes. Considering only the baryon\nnumber conserving leptoquark interactions, we estimate the branching ratios for\nthe exclusive $\\bar{B} \\rightarrow \\bar{K}^{(*)} \\nu \\bar{\\nu}$ and inclusive\n$B \\rightarrow X_s \\nu \\bar{\\nu}$ decay processes by using the constraint\nparameters. We also obtain the low recoil (large lepton invariant mass, i.e.,\n$q^2 \\sim m^2_b$) predictions for the angular distribution of $\\bar B\n\\rightarrow \\bar{K} l^+ l^-$ process and several other observables including\nthe flat term and lepton flavour non-universality factor in this model.\n", "  The equation of state of cold baryonic matter is studied within a\nrelativistic mean-field model with hadron masses and coupling constants\ndepending on a scalar field. We demonstrate that if the effective nucleon mass\nstops to decrease with a density increase at densities $n>n_*>n_0$, where $n_0$\nis the nuclear saturation density, the equation of state stiffens for these\ndensities and the limiting neutron star mass increases. The stabilization of\nthe nucleon mass can be realised if in the equation of motion for the scalar\nmean-field there appear a term sharply varying in a narrow vicinity of the\nfield value corresponding to the density $n_*$. We show several possible\nrealizations of this mechanism getting sufficiently stiff equations of state.\nThe appearance of hyperons in dense neutron star interiors is accounted for.\nThe obtained equations of state remain sufficiently stiff if the reduction of\nthe $\\phi$ meson mass is incorporated. Thereby, the hyperon puzzle can be\nresolved.\n", "  We present distance scale measurements from the baryon acoustic oscillation\nsignal in the CMASS and LOWZ samples from the Data Release 12 of the Baryon\nOscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS). The total volume probed is 14.5\nGpc$^3$, a 10 per cent increment from Data Release 11. From an analysis of the\nspherically averaged correlation function, we infer a distance to $z=0.57$ of\n$D_V(z)r^{\\rm fid}_{\\rm d}/r_ {\\rm d}=2028\\pm21$ Mpc and a distance to $z=0.32$\nof $D_V(z)r^{\\rm fid}_{\\rm d}/r_{\\rm d}=1264\\pm22$ Mpc assuming a cosmology in\nwhich $r^{\\rm fid}_{\\rm d}=147.10$ Mpc. From the anisotropic analysis, we find\nan angular diameter distance to $z=0.57$ of $D_{\\rm A}(z)r^{\\rm fid}_{\\rm\nd}/r_{\\rm d}=1401\\pm21$ Mpc and a distance to $z=0.32$ of $981\\pm20$ Mpc, a 1.5\nper cent and 2.0 per cent measurement respectively. The Hubble parameter at\n$z=0.57$ is $H(z)r_{\\rm d}/r^{\\rm fid}_{\\rm d}=100.3\\pm3.7$ km s$^{-1}$\nMpc$^{-1}$ and its value at $z=0.32$ is $79.2\\pm5.6$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$, a\n3.7 per cent and 7.1 per cent measurement respectively. These cosmic distance\nscale constraints are in excellent agreement with a $\\Lambda$CDM model with\ncosmological parameters released by the recent Planck 2015 results.\n", "  The Eastern Banded Structure (EBS) and Hydra~I halo overdensity are very\nnearby (d $\\sim$ 10 kpc) objects discovered in SDSS data. Previous studies of\nthe region have shown that EBS and Hydra I are spatially coincident, cold\nstructures at the same distance, suggesting that Hydra I may be the EBS's\nprogenitor. We combine new wide-field DECam imaging and MMT/Hectochelle\nspectroscopic observations of Hydra I with SDSS archival spectroscopic\nobservations to quantify Hydra I's present-day chemodynamical properties, and\nto infer whether it originated as a star cluster or dwarf galaxy. While\nprevious work using shallow SDSS imaging assumed a standard old, metal-poor\nstellar population, our deeper DECam imaging reveals that Hydra~I has a thin,\nwell-defined main sequence turnoff of intermediate age ($\\sim 5-6$ Gyr) and\nmetallicity ([Fe/H] = $-0.9$ dex). We measure statistically significant spreads\nin both the iron and alpha-element abundances of $\\sigma_{[Fe/H]} = 0.13 \\pm\n0.02$ dex and $\\sigma_{[\\alpha/{\\rm Fe}]} = 0.09 \\pm 0.03$ dex, respectively,\nand place upper limits on both the rotation and its proper motion. Hydra~I's\nintermediate age and [Fe/H] -- as well as its low [$\\alpha$/Fe], apparent\n[Fe/H] spread, and present-day low luminosity -- suggest that its progenitor\nwas a dwarf galaxy, which subsequently lost more than $99.99\\%$ of its stellar\nmass.\n", "  Superconducting properties were studied on high quality superconductors\n$Ba_{x}(NH_{3})Fe_{2}Se_{2}$ ($T_{c}$ = 39 K) and $Sr_{x}(NH_{3})Fe_{2}Se_{2}$\n($T_{c}$ = 44 K) prepared by intercalating Ba/Sr atoms into tetragonal\n$\\beta$-FeSe by liquid ammonia. The elongated c-axis and almost unchanged\na-axis of $Ba_{x}(NH_{3})Fe_{2}Se_{2}$, comparing with $\\beta$-FeSe, suggested\nan unchanged intra-$Fe_{2}Se_{2}$-layer structure and the $T_{c}$ enhancement\nis due to a 3D to 2D-like Fermi surface transformation. The superconducting\ncoherent lengths $\\xi$(0), Ginzburg-Landau parameters $\\kappa$ and penetration\ndepths $\\lambda$(0) obtained from the extrapolated lower and upper critical\nfields $B_{c1}$(0) and $B_{c2}$(0) indicates that both compounds are typical\ntype-II superconductors. The temperature dependence of 1/$\\lambda^{2}$(T) of\n$Ba_{x}(NH_{3})Fe_{2}Se_{2}$ deduced from the low field magnetic susceptibility\nshows a two-gap s-wave behaviour with superconducting gaps of $\\Delta_{1}$ =\n6.47 meV and $\\Delta_{2}$ = 1.06 meV.\n", "  The measurement of positions and sizes of radio sources in the observations\nof solar radio spectral fine structures in an M6.5 flare on April 11, 2013 were\nobserved simultaneously by several radio instruments at four different\nobservatories: Chinese Solar Broadband Radio Spectrometers at Huairou\n(SBRS/Huairou), Ondrejov Radio spectrograph in the Czech Republic\n(ORSC/Ondrejov), Badary Broadband Microwave spectropolarimeter (BMS/Irkutsk),\nand spectrograph/IZMIRAN (Moscow, Troitsk). The fine structures include\nmicrowave zebra patterns (ZP), fast pulsations, and fibers. They were observed\nduring the flare brightening located at the tops of a loop arcade. The dynamics\nof the polarization was associated with the motion of the flare exciter, which\nwas observed in EUV images at 171A and 131A (SDO/AIA). Combining magnetograms\nobserved by the SDO Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) with the homologous\nassumption of EUV flare brightening and ZP bursts, we deduced that the observed\nZPs correspond to the ordinary radio emission mode. However, future analysis\nneeds to verify the assumption that zebra radio sources are really related to a\nclosed magnetic loop, and are located at lower heights in the solar atmosphere\nthan the source of pulsations.\n", "  In this paper, we report the observation and exploitation of the capability\nof light to self-organize its state-of-polarization, upon propagation in\noptical fibers, by means of a device called Omnipolarizer. The principle of\noperation of this system consists in a counter-propagating four-wave mixing\ninteraction between an incident signal and its backward replica generated at\nthe fiber output thanks to a reflective fiber loop. We have exploited this\nself-induced polarization tracking phenomenon for all-optical data processing\nand successfully demonstrated the spontaneous repolarization of a 40-Gbit/s\nOn-Off keying optical signal without noticeable impairments. Moreover, the\nstrong local coupling between the two counter-propagating waves has also\nrevealed a fascinating aspect of the Omnipolarizer called polarization-based\ntunneling effect. This intrinsic property enables us to instantaneously let\njump a polarization information onto the reflected signal, long before the\nexpected time-of-flight induced by the round-trip along the fiber span.\nFinally, we discuss how the concept of self-organization could be generalized\nto multimode fibers, which paves the way to new important applications in the\nframework of spatial-mode-multiplexing.\n", "  Generation of high intensity attopulses is investigated in cylindrical\ngeometry by using 3D particle-in-cell plasma simulation code. Due to the\nrotation symmetric target, a circularly polarized laser pulse is considered\npropagating on the axis of a hollow cone-like target. The large incidence angle\nand constant ponderomotive pressure leads to nano-bunching of relativistic\nelectrons responsible for the laser-driven synchrotron emission. A numerical\nmethod is developed to find the source and direction of the coherent radiation\nthat is responsible for the existence of attopulses. The intensity modulation\nin the harmonic spectrum is well described by the model of coherent synchrotron\nemission extended to the regime of higher order \\gamma-spikes. The spatial\ndistribution of the higher harmonics resembles a spiral shape which gets\nfocused into a small volume behind the target.\n", "  Materials with extreme mechanical anisotropy are designed to work near a\nmaterial instability threshold where they display stress channelling and strain\nlocalization, effects that can be exploited in several technologies. Extreme\ncouple stress solids are introduced and for the first time systematically\nanalyzed in terms of several material instability criteria:\npositive-definiteness of the strain energy (implying uniqueness of the mixed\nb.v.p.), strong ellipticity (implying uniqueness of the b.v.p. with prescribed\nkinematics on the whole boundary), plane wave propagation, ellipticity, and the\nemergence of discontinuity surfaces. Several new and unexpected features are\nhighlighted: (i.) Ellipticity is mainly dictated by the 'Cosserat part' of the\nelasticity and (ii.) its failure is shown to be related to the emergence of\ndiscontinuity surfaces; (iii.) Ellipticity and wave propagation are not\ninterdependent conditions (so that it is possible for waves not to propagate\nwhen the material is still in the elliptic range and, in very special cases,\nfor waves to propagate when ellipticity does not hold). The proof that loss of\nellipticity induces stress channelling, folding and faulting of an elastic\nCosserat continuum (and the related derivation of the infinite-body Green's\nfunction under antiplane strain conditions) is deferred to Part II of this\nstudy.\n", "  We discuss the plastic behavior of an amorphous matrix reinforced by hard\nparticles. A mesoscopic depinning-like model accounting for Eshelby elastic\ninteractions is implemented. Only the effect of a plastic disorder is\nconsidered. Numerical results show a complex size-dependence of the effective\nflow stress of the amorphous composite. In particular the departure from the\nmixing law shows opposite trends associated to the competing effects of the\nmatrix and the reinforcing particles respectively. The reinforcing mechanisms\nand their effects on localization are discussed. Plastic strain is shown to\ngradually concentrate on the weakest band of the system. This correlation of\nthe plastic behavior with the material structure is used to design a simple\nanalytical model. The latter nicely captures reinforcement size effects in\n$-(\\log N/N)^{1/2}$ observed numerically. Predictions of the effective flow\nstress accounting for further logarithmic corrections show a very good\nagreement with numerical results.\n", "  We present a new algorithm to identify fragments in computer simulations of\nrelativistic heavy ion collisions. It is based on the simulated annealing\ntechnique and can be applied to n-body transport models like the Quantum\nMolecular Dynamics. This new approach is able to predict isotope yields as well\nas hyper-nucleus production. In order to illustrate its predicting power, we\nconfront this new method to experimental data, and show the sensitivity on the\nparameters which govern the cluster formation.\n", "  It is a well-known fact that the minimal renormalizable supersymmetric SU(5)\nmodel is ruled out assuming superpartner masses of the order of a few TeV.\nGiving up this constraint and assuming only SU(5) boundary conditions for the\nsoft terms, we find that the model is still alive. The viable region of the\nparameter space typically features superpartner masses of order $10^2$ to\n$10^4$ TeV, with tan beta values between 2 and 5, but lighter spectra with\nsingle states around 10 TeV are also possible. The main constraints come from\nproton decay, the Higgs mass, the requirement of the SU(5) spectrum being\nreasonably below the Planck scale, and the lifetime of the universe. A generic\nfeature of the model is metastability of the electroweak vacuum. In the absence\nof a suitable dark matter particle in the neutralino sector, a light (order GeV\nor smaller) gravitino is a natural candidate.\n", "  The antiplane strain Green's functions for an applied concentrated force and\nmoment are obtained for Cosserat elastic solids with extreme anisotropy, which\ncan be tailored to bring the material in a state close to an instability\nthreshold such as failure of ellipticity. It is shown that the wave propagation\ncondition (and not ellipticity) governs the behavior of the antiplane strain\nGreen's functions. These Green's functions are used as perturbing agents to\ndemonstrate in an extreme material the emergence of localized (single and\ncross) stress channelling and the emergence of antiplane localized folding (or\ncreasing, or weak elastostatic shock) and faulting (or elastostatic shock) of a\nCosserat continuum, phenomena which remain excluded for a Cauchy elastic\nmaterial. During folding some components of the displacement gradient suffer a\nfinite jump, whereas during faulting the displacement itself displays a finite\ndiscontinuity.\n", "  We present an evolutionary sequence of models of the photoionized disk-wind\noutflow around forming massive stars based on the Core Accretion model. The\noutflow is expected to be the first structure to be ionized by the protostar\nand can confine the expansion of the HII region, especially in lateral\ndirections in the plane of the accretion disk. The ionizing luminosity\nincreases as Kelvin-Helmholz contraction proceeds, and the HII region is formed\nwhen the stellar mass reaches ~10-20Msun depending on the initial cloud core\nproperties. Although some part of outer disk surface remains neutral due to\nshielding by the inner disk and the disk wind, almost the whole of the outflow\nis ionized in 1e3-1e4 yr after initial HII region formation. Having calculated\nthe extent and temperature structure of the HII region within the immediate\nprotostellar environment, we then make predictions for the strength of its\nfree-free continuum and recombination line emission. The free-free radio\nemission from the ionized outflow has a flux density of ~(20-200)x(nu/10GHz)^p\nmJy for a source at a distance of 1 kpc with a spectral index p~0.4-0.7, and\nthe apparent size is typically ~500AU at 10GHz. The H40alpha line profile has a\nwidth of about 100km/s. These properties of our model are consistent with\nobserved radio winds and jets around forming massive protostars.\n", "  We compute the spectra of the Hessian matrix, ${\\cal H}$, and the matrix\n${\\cal M}$ that governs the critical point equation of the low-energy effective\nsupergravity, as a function of the complex structure and axio-dilaton moduli\nspace in type IIB flux compactifications at large complex structure. We find\nboth spectra analytically in an $h^{1,2}_-+3$ real-dimensional subspace of the\nmoduli space, and show that they exhibit a universal structure with highly\ndegenerate eigenvalues, independently of the choice of flux, the details of the\ncompactification geometry, and the number of complex structure moduli. In this\nsubspace, the spectrum of the Hessian matrix contains no tachyons, but there\nare also no critical points. We show numerically that the spectra of ${\\cal H}$\nand ${\\cal M}$ remain highly peaked over a large fraction of the sampled moduli\nspace of explicit Calabi-Yau compactifications with 2 to 5 complex structure\nmoduli. In these models, the scale of the supersymmetric contribution to the\nscalar masses is strongly linearly correlated with the value of the\nsuperpotential over almost the entire moduli space, with particularly strong\ncorrelations arising for $g_s < 1$. We contrast these results with the\nexpectations from the much-used continuous flux approximation, and comment on\nthe applicability of Random Matrix Theory to the statistical modelling of the\nstring theory landscape.\n", "  We construct a new set of generalized coherent states, the electron-hole\ncoherent states, for a (quasi-)spin particle on the infinite line. The\ndefinition is inspired by applications to the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations\nwhere the quasi-spin refers to electron- and hole-like components of electronic\nexcitations in a superconductor. Electron-hole coherent states generally\nentangle the space and the quasi-spin degrees of freedom. We show that the\nelectron-hole coherent states allow obtaining a resolution of unity and form\nminimum uncertainty states for position and velocity where the velocity\noperator is defined using the Bogoliubov-de Gennes Hamiltonian. The usefulness\nand the limitations of electron-hole coherent states and the phase space\nrepresentations built from them are discussed in terms of basic applications to\nthe Bogoliubov-de Gennes equation such as Andreev reflection.\n", "  It is argued that an irregularity in the baryon stopping is a natural\nconsequence of onset of deconfinement occurring in the compression stage of a\nnuclear collision. It is an effect of the softest point inherent in an equation\nof state (EoS) with a deconfinement transition. In order to illustrate this\neffect, calculations within the three-fluid model were performed with three\ndifferent EoS's: a purely hadronic EoS, an EoS with a first-order phase\ntransition and that with a smooth crossover transition.\n", "  The Polyakov linear-sigma model (PLSM) and Hadron Resonance Gas (HRG) model\nare considered to study the hadronic and partonic equation(s) of state, the\npressure, and response to finite magnetic field, the magnetization. The results\nare confronted to recent lattice QCD calculations. Both models are in fairly\ngood agreement with the lattice.\n", "  We discuss the effect that small fluctuations of local anisotropy of\npressure, and energy density, may have on the occurrence of cracking in\nspherical compact objects, satisfying a polytropic equation of state. Two\ndifferent kind of polytropes are considered. For both, it is shown that\ndepartures from equilibrium may lead to the appearance of cracking, for a wide\nrange of values of the parameters defining the polytrope. Prospective\napplications of the obtained results, to some astrophysical scenarios, are\npointed out.\n", "  In this paper, we study information transport in multiplex networks comprised\nof two coupled subnetworks. The upper subnetwork, called the logical layer,\nemploys the shortest paths protocol to determine the logical paths for packets\ntransmission, while the lower subnetwork acts as the physical layer, in which\npackets are delivered by the biased random walk mechanism characterized with a\nparameter $\\alpha$. Through simulation, we obtain the optimal $\\alpha$\ncorresponding to the maximum network lifetime and the maximum number of the\narrival packets. Assortative coupling is better than the random coupling and\nthe disassortative coupling, since it achieves much better transmission\nperformances. Generally, the more homogeneous the lower subnetwork, the better\nthe transmission performances are, which is opposite for the upper subnetwork.\nFinally, we propose an attack centrality for nodes based on the topological\ninformation of both subnetworks, and further investigate the transmission\nperformances under targeted attacks. Our work helps to understand the spreading\nand robustness issues of multiplex networks and provides some clues about the\ndesigning of more efficient and robust routing architectures in communication\nsystems.\n", "  We present a method to derive asymptotics of eigenvalues for trace-class\nintegral operators $K:L^2(J;d\\lambda)\\circlearrowleft$, acting on a single\ninterval $J\\subset\\mathbb{R}$, which belong to the ring of integrable operators\n\\cite{IIKS}. Our emphasis lies on the behavior of the spectrum\n$\\{\\lambda_i(J)\\}_{i=0}^{\\infty}$ of $K$ as $|J|\\rightarrow\\infty$ and $i$ is\nfixed. We show that this behavior is intimately linked to the analysis of the\nFredholm determinant $\\det(I-\\gamma K)|_{L^2(J)}$ as $|J|\\rightarrow\\infty$ and\n$\\gamma\\uparrow 1$ in a Stokes type scaling regime. Concrete asymptotic\nformul\\ae\\, are obtained for the eigenvalues of Airy and Bessel kernels in\nrandom matrix theory.\n", "  We study all possible observables in $B\\to D^{(\\ast)}\\tau\\nu_{\\tau}$ with new\nphysics (NP), including new vector, scalar and tensor interactions, and\ninvestigate the prospects of extracting NP Wilson coefficients with optimal\nobservables. Analysis of the full $q^2$ integrated branching fractions of $B\\to\nD^{(\\ast)}\\tau\\nu_{\\tau}$ show that the overall sensitivity of the observables\nof $B\\to D \\tau\\nu_{\\tau}$ is more towards the scalar current, whereas the\nbin-by-bin analysis of $q^2$ distribution of the differential branching\nfraction points to regions of $q^2$ sensitive to tensor interactions.\nInterestingly, the observables in $B\\to D^{\\ast}\\tau\\nu_{\\tau}$ are more\nsensitive to tensor interactions, and bin-by-bin analysis of this mode shows\nthe distinct regions of $q^2$ sensitive to vector or scalar interactions. In\naddition to that, the $\\tau$ polarisation asymmetry is found to be more\nsensitive to NP compared to the other observables, in both decay modes.\n", "  Gompertz's law tells us that for humans above the age of 35 the death rate\nincreases exponentially with a doubling time of about 10 years. Here, we show\nthat the same law continues to hold even for ages over 100. Beyond 106 there is\nso far no statistical evidence available because the number of survivors is too\nsmall even in the largest nations. However assuming that Gompertz's law\ncontinues to hold beyond 106, we conclude that the mortality rate becomes equal\nto 1 at age 120 (meaning that there are 1,000 deaths in a population of one\nthousand). In other words, the upper bound of human life is near 120. The\nexistence of this fixed-point has interesting implications. It allows us to\npredict the form of the relationship between death rates at age 35 and the\ndoubling time of Gompertz's law. In order to test this prediction, we first\ncarry out a transversal analysis for a sample of countries comprising both\nindustrialized and developing nations. As further confirmation, we also develop\na longitudinal analysis using historical data over a time period of almost two\ncenturies. Another prediction arising from this fixed-point model, is that,\nabove a given population threshold, the lifespan of the oldest person is\nindependent of the size of her national community. This prediction is supported\nby available empirical evidence.\n", "  The influence of small random perturbations on a deterministic dynamical\nsystem with a locally stable equilibrium is considered. The perturbed system is\ndescribed by the It\\^{o} stochastic differential equation. It is assumed that\nthe noise does not vanish at the equilibrium. In this case the trajectories of\nthe stochastic system may leave any bounded domain with probability one. We\nanalyze the stochastic stability of the equilibrium under a persistent\nperturbation by white noise on an asymptotically long time interval $0\\leq\nt\\leq \\mathcal O(\\mu^{-N})$, where $0<\\mu\\ll 1$ is a perturbation parameter.\n", "  We report on the application of a cascade + viscous hydro + cascade model for\nheavy ion collisions in the RHIC Beam Energy Scan range, $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm\nNN}}=6.3\\dots200$ GeV. By constraining model parameters to reproduce the data\nwe find that the effective(average) value of the shear viscosity over entropy\ndensity ratio $\\eta/s$ decreases from 0.2 to 0.08 when collision energy grows\nfrom $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}\\approx7$ to 39 GeV.\n", "  The Fano effect (U. Fano, Phys. Rev. \\textbf{15},1866 (1961) shows that an\ninelastic scattering process can be suppressed when the output channel (OC) is\ncoupled to an isolated bound state. In this paper we investigate the\napplication of this effect for the suppression of two-body collisional losses\nof ultracold atoms. The Fano effect is originally derived via a first-order\nperturbation treatment for coupling between the incident channel (IC) and the\nOC. We generalize the Fano effect to systems with arbitrarily strong IC--OC\ncouplings. We analytically prove that, in a system with one IC and one OC, when\nthe inter-atomic interaction potentials are real functions of the inter-atomic\ndistance, the exact s-wave inelastic scattering amplitude can always be\nsuppressed to \\emph{zero} by coupling between the IC or the OC (or both of\nthem) and an extra isolated bound state. We further show that when the\nlow-energy inelastic collision between two ultracold atoms is suppressed by\nthis effect, the real part of the elastic scattering length between the atoms\nis still possible to be much larger than the range of inter-atomic\ninteraction.In addition, when open scattering channels are coupled to two bound\nstates, with the help of the Fano effect, independent control of the elastic\nand inelastic scattering amplitudes of two ultracold atoms can be achieved.\nPossible experimental realizations of our scheme are also discussed.\n", "  Holomorphic fields play an important role in 2d conformal field theory. We\ngeneralize them to d>2 by introducing the notion of Cauchy conformal fields,\nwhich satisfy a first order differential equation such that they are determined\neverywhere once we know their value on a codimension 1 surface. We classify all\nthe unitary Cauchy fields. By analyzing the mode expansion on the unit sphere,\nwe show that all unitary Cauchy fields are free in the sense that their\ncorrelation functions factorize on the 2-point function. We also discuss the\npossibility of non-unitary Cauchy fields and classify them in d=3 and 4.\n", "  We extend the class of QM problems which permit for quasi-exact solutions.\nSpecifically, we consider planar motion of two interacting charges in a\nconstant uniform magnetic field. While Turbiner and Escobar-Ruiz (2013)\naddressed the case of the Coulomb interaction between the particles, we explore\nthree other potentials. We do this by reducing the appropriate Hamiltonians to\nthe second-order polynomials in the generators of the representation of\n$SL(2,C)$ group in the differential form. This allows us to perform partial\ndiagonalisation of the Hamiltonian, and to reduce the search for the first few\nenergies and the corresponding wave functions to an algebraic procedure.\n", "  The three-body force is indispensable in nuclear energy density functionals\nwhich leads to a density dependent two-body term in the Hartree-Fock approach.\nUsually a single factional power of density dependency has been adopted. We\nconsider the possibility of an additional higher-order density dependence in\nextended Skyrme forces. As a result, new extended Skyrme parametertizations\nbased on the SLy4 force are obtained and the improvements in descriptions of\nglobal nuclei have been demonstrated. The higher-order term can also\nsubstantially affect nuclear properties in the high density region in general\nways.\n", "  We investigate numerically the spin properties of electrons in flakes made of\nmaterials described by the Dirac equation, at the presence of intrinsic\nspin-orbit-coupling(SOC). We show that electrons flowing along the borders of\nflakes via edge states, become helically spin-polarized for strong SOC, for\nmaterials with and without a gap at the Fermi energy, corresponding to the\nmassive and massless Dirac equation respectively. The helically spin-polarized\nelectrons cause geometrical spin splitting on opposite sides of the flakes,\nleading to spin-resolved transport controlled by the flake's geometry in a\nmulti-terminal device setup. A simple analytical model containing the basic\ningredients of the problem is introduced to get an insight of the helical\nmechanism, along with our numerical results which are based on an effective\ntight-binding model.\n", "  The neutron capture cross sections and average radiative widths of neutron\nresonances for two double-magic nuclei 132Sn and 208Pb have been calculated\nusing the microscopic photon strength functions, which were obtained within the\nmicroscopic self-consistent version of the extended theory of finite Fermi\nsystems in the time blocking approximation. For the first time, the microscopic\nPSFs have been obtained within the fully self-consistent approach with exact\naccounting for the single particle continuum (for 208Pb). The approach includes\nphonon coupling effects in addition to the standard RPA approach. The known\nSkyrme force has been used. The calculations of nuclear reaction\ncharacteristics have been performed with the EMPIRE 3.1 nuclear reaction code.\nHere, three nuclear level density (NLD) models have been used: the so-called\nphenomenological GSM, the EMPIRE specific (or Enhanced GSM) and the\nmicroscopical combinatorial HFB NLD models. For both considered characteristics\nwe found a significant disagreement between the results obtained with the GSM\nand HFB NLD models. For 208Pb, a reasonable agreement has been found with\nsystematics for the average radiative widths values with HFB NLD and with the\nexperimental data for the HFB NLD average resonance spacing D0, while for these\ntwo quantities the differences between the values obtained with GSM and HFB NLD\nare of several orders of magnitude. The discrepancies between the results with\nthe phenomenological EGLO PSF and microscopic RPA or TBA are much less for the\nsame NLD model.\n", "  We report on the first detection of extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) absorption\nvariability in the NeVIII 770,780 mini-broad absorption line (mini-BAL) in the\nspectrum of the quasar (QSO) PG 1206+459. The observed equivalent width (EW) of\nthe NeVIII doublet show a ~4 sigma variation over a timescale of 2.8 months in\nthe QSO's rest-frame. Both members of the NeVIII doublet exhibit non-black\nsaturation, indicating partial coverage of the continuum source. An increase in\nthe NeVIII covering fraction from f_c = 0.59\\pm0.05 to 0.72\\pm0.03 is observed\nover the same period. The NeVIII profiles are too highly saturated to be\nsusceptible to changes in the ionization state of the absorbing gas. In fact,\nwe do not observe any significant variation in the EW and/or column density\nafter correcting the spectra for partial coverage. We, thus, propose transverse\nmotions of the absorbing gas being the cause of the observed variability. Using\na simple model of a transiting cloud we estimate a transverse speed of ~1800\nkm/s. For Keplerian motion, this corresponds to a distance between the absorber\nand the central engine of ~1.3 pc, which places the absorber just outside the\nBLR region. We further estimate a density of ~5\\times10^6 cm^(-3) and a kinetic\nluminosity of ~10^43 - 10^44 erg/s. Such large kinetic powers suggest that\noutflows detected via EUV lines are potentially major contributors to AGN\nfeedback.\n", "  We show that supercritically charged black holes with NUT provide a new\nsetting for traversable wormholes. This does not require exotic matter, a price\nbeing the Misner string singularities. Without assuming time periodicity to\nmake Misner strings unobservable, we show that, contrary to expectations,\ngeodesics do not stop there. Moreover, since there is no central singularity\nthe space-time turns out to be geodesically complete. Another unpleasant\nfeature of spacetimes with NUTs is the presence of regions where the azimuthal\nangle $\\varphi$ becomes timelike, signalling the appearance of closed timelike\ncurves (CTCs). We show that among them there are no closed timelike or null\ngeodesics, so the freely falling observers should not encounter causality\nviolations. Considering worldlines of charged particles, we find that, although\nthese can become closed in the vicinity of the wormhole throat for large enough\ncharge-to-mass ratio, the non-causal orbits are still disconnected from the\ndistant zones. All these findings support our feeling that wormholes with NUTs\ndeserve to be taken seriously. Integrating the geodesic equations completely,\nwe demonstrate the existence of timelike and null geodesics connecting two\nasymptotic regions of the wormhole, such that the tidal forces in the throat\nare reasonably small. We discuss bounds on the NUT charge which follow from the\nSchwinger pair creation and ionization thresholds and speculate that such NUT\nwormholes could be present in some galactic centers.\n", "  We study the production of hadronic resonances and their interaction in the\npartonic and hadronic medium using the EPOS3 model, which employs the UrQMD\nmodel for the description of the hadronic phase. We investigate the centrality\ndependence of the yields and momentum distributions for various resonances\n(rho(770),K(892),phi(1020),Delta(1232),Sigma(1385),Lambda(1520),Xi(1530) and\ntheir antiparticles) in Pb-Pb collisions at sNN= 2.76 TeV. The predictions for\nK(892) and phi(1020) will be compared with the experimental data from the ALICE\ncollaboration. The observed signal suppression of the K(892) with increasing\ncentrality will be discussed with respect to the resonance interaction in the\nhadronic medium. The mean transverse momentum and other particle ratios such as\nphi(1020)/p and Omega/phi(1020) will be discussed with respect to additional\ncontributions from the hadronic medium interactions.\n", "  The Kosambi-Cartan-Chern (KCC) theory represents a powerful mathematical\nmethod for the investigation of the properties of dynamical systems. The KCC\ntheory introduces a geometric description of the time evolution of a dynamical\nsystem, with the solution curves of the dynamical system described by methods\ninspired by the theory of geodesics in a Finsler spaces. The evolution of a\ndynamical system is geometrized by introducing a non-linear connection, which\nallows the construction of the KCC covariant derivative, and of the deviation\ncurvature tensor. In the KCC theory the properties of any dynamical system are\ndescribed in terms of five geometrical invariants, with the second one giving\nthe Jacobi stability of the system. Usually, the KCC theory is formulated by\nreducing the dynamical evolution equations to a set of second order\ndifferential equations. In the present paper we introduce and develop the KCC\napproach for dynamical systems described by systems of arbitrary\n$n$-dimensional first order differential equations. We investigate in detail\nthe properties of the $n$-dimensional autonomous dynamical systems, as well as\nthe relationship between the linear stability and the Jacobi stability. As a\nmain result we find that only even-dimensional dynamical systems can exhibit\nboth Jacobi stability and instability behaviors, while odd-dimensional\ndynamical systems are always Jacobi unstable, no matter their Lyapunov\nstability. As applications of the developed formalism we consider the\ngeometrization and the study of the Jacobi stability of the complex dynamical\nnetworks, and of the $\\Lambda $-Cold Dark Matter cosmological models,\nrespectively.\n", "  We study spin-orbit torques in two dimensional hexagonal crystals such as\ngraphene, silicene, germanene and stanene. The torque possesses two components,\na field-like term due to inverse spin galvanic effect and an antidamping torque\noriginating from Berry curvature in mixed spin-$k$ space. In the presence of\nstaggered potential and exchange field, the valley degeneracy can be lifted and\nwe obtain a valley-dependent Berry curvature, leading to a tunable antidamping\ntorque by controlling the valley degree of freedom. The valley imbalance can be\nas high as 100\\% by tuning the bias voltage or magnetization angle. These\nfindings open new venues for the development of current-driven spin-orbit\ntorques by structural design.\n", "  This lecture on adiabatic oscillations is intended to present the basis of\nasteroseismology and to serve as an introduction for other lectures of the EES\n2014. It also exposes the state-of-the-art of solar-like oscillation analysis,\nas revealed by the space missions CoRoT and Kepler. A large part of the lecture\nis devoted to the interpretation of the modes with a mixed character that\nreveal the properties of the radiative cores of subgiants and red giants.\n", "  We present an extension of the random--phase approximation (RPA) where the\nRPA phonons are used as building blocks to construct the excited states. In our\nmodel, that we call double RPA (DRPA), we include up to two RPA phonons. This\nis an approximate and simplified way, with respect to the full second\nrandom--phase approximation (SRPA), to extend the RPA by including two\nparticle--two hole configurations. Some limitations of the standard SRPA model,\nrelated to the violation of the stability condition, are not encountered in the\nDRPA. We also verify in this work that the energy--weighted sum rules are\nsatisfied. The DRPA is applied to low--energy modes and giant resonances in the\nnucleus $^{16}$O. We show that the model (i) produces a global downwards shift\nof the energies with respect to the RPA spectra; (ii) provides a shift that is\nhowever strongly reduced compared to that generated by the standard SRPA. This\nmodel represents an alternative way of correcting for the SRPA anomalous energy\nshift, compared to a recently developed extension of the SRPA, where a\nsubtraction procedure is applied. The DRPA provides results in good agreeement\nwith the experimental energies, with the exception of those low--lying states\nthat have a dominant two particle--two hole nature. For describing such states,\nhigher--order calculations are needed.\n", "  In this letter, we study the scaling properties of multi-year observed and\natmospheric model-generated wind time series. We have found that the extended\nself-similarity holds for the observed series, and remarkably, the scaling\nexponents corresponding to the meoscale range closely match the well-accepted\ninertial-range turbulence values. However, the scaling results from the\nsimulated time series are significantly different.\n", "  We study the role of the $f_1(1285)$ resonance in the decays of $J/\\psi \\to\n\\phi \\bar{K} K^*$ and $J/\\psi \\to \\phi f_1(1285)$. The theoretical approach is\nbased on the results of chiral unitary theory where the $f_1(1285)$ resonance\nis dynamically generated from the $K^* \\bar{K} - c.c.$ interaction. In order to\nfurther test the dynamical nature of the $f_1(1285)$ state, we investigate the\n$J/\\psi \\to \\phi \\bar{K} K^*$ decay close to the $\\bar{K} K^*$ threshold and\nmake predictions for the ratio of the invariant mass distributions of the\n$J/\\psi \\to \\phi \\bar{K} K^*$ decay and the $J/\\psi \\to \\phi f_1(1285)$ partial\ndecay width with all the parameters of the mechanism fixed in previous studies.\nThe results can be tested in future experiments and therefore offer new clues\non the nature of the $f_1(1285)$ state.\n", "  We propose a physical realization of a commuting Hamiltonian of interacting\nMajorana fermions realizing $Z_{2}$ topological order, using an array of\nJosephson-coupled topological superconductor islands. The required multi-body\ninteraction Hamiltonian is naturally generated by a combination of charging\nenergy induced quantum phase-slips on the superconducting islands and electron\ntunneling. Our setup improves on a recent proposal for implementing a Majorana\nfermion surface code [1], a 'hybrid' approach to fault-tolerant quantum\ncomputation that combines (1) the engineering of a stabilizer Hamiltonian with\na topologically ordered ground state with (2) projective stabilizer\nmeasurements to implement error correction and a universal set of logical\ngates. Our hybrid strategy has advantages over the traditional surface code\narchitecture in error suppression and single-step stabilizer measurements, and\nis widely applicable to implementing stabilizer codes for quantum computation.\n", "  The Nekrasov-Shatashvili limit of the N=2 SU(2) pure gauge (Omega-deformed)\nsuper Yang-Mills theory encodes the information about the spectrum of the\nMathieu operator. On the other hand, the Mathieu equation emerges entirely\nwithin the frame of two-dimensional conformal field theory (2d CFT) as the\nclassical limit of the null vector decoupling equation for some degenerate\nirregular block. Therefore, it seems to be possible to investigate the spectrum\nof the Mathieu operator employing the techniques of 2d CFT. To exploit this\nstrategy, a full correspondence between the Mathieu equation and its\nrealization within 2d CFT has to be established. In our previous paper [1], we\nhave found that the expression of the Mathieu eigenvalue given in terms of the\nclassical irregular block exactly coincides with the well known weak coupling\nexpansion of this eigenvalue in the case in which the auxiliary parameter is\nthe noninteger Floquet exponent. In the present work we verify that the formula\nfor the corresponding eigenfunction obtained from the irregular block\nreproduces the so-called Mathieu exponent from which the noninteger order\nelliptic cosine and sine functions may be constructed. The derivation of the\nMathieu equation within the formalism of 2d CFT is based on conjectures\nconcerning the asymptotic behaviour of irregular blocks in the classical limit.\nA proof of these hypotheses is sketched. Finally, we speculate on how it could\nbe possible to use the methods of 2d CFT in order to get from the irregular\nblock the eigenvalues of the Mathieu operator in other regions of the coupling\nconstant.\n", "  At present, the main challenge to the interpretation of variations in\ngravity-sensitive line strengths as driven by a non-universal initial mass\nfunction (IMF), lies in understanding the effect of other parameters describing\nunresolved stellar populations, such as elemental abundance ratios. We combine\nvarious TiO-based, IMF-sensitive indicators in the optical and NIR spectral\nwindows, along with the FeH-based Wing-Ford band to break this degeneracy. We\nobtain a significant radial trend of the IMF slope in XSG1, a massive\nearly-type galaxy (ETG), with velocity dispersion sigma~300km/s, observed with\nthe VLT/X-SHOOTER instrument. In addition, we constrain both the shape and\nnormalization of the IMF based only on a stellar population analysis. We\nrobustly rule out a single power-law to describe the IMF, whereas a power law\ntapered off to a constant value at low masses (defined as a bimodal IMF) is\nconsistent with all the observational spectroscopic data and with the stellar\nM/L constraints based on the Jeans Anisotropic Modelling method. The IMF in\nXSG1 is bottom-heavy in the central regions (corresponding to a bimodal IMF\nslope Gb~3, or a mass normalization mismatch parameter alpha~2), changing\ntowards a standard Milky-Way like IMF (Gb~1.3; alpha~1) around half of the\neffective radius. This result, combined with previous observations of local IMF\nvariations in massive ETGs, reflects the varying processes underlying the\nformation of this type of galaxies, between the central core and the outer\nregions.\n", "  New experimental data on transverse momentum spectra of strange particles\n(KS0, K-, K*, phi,...) produced in pp collisions at sqrt s = 200 GeV obtained\nby the STAR and PHENIX collaborations at RHIC are analysed in the framework of\nz-scaling approach. Scaling properties of the data z-presentation are\nillustrated. Self-similarity of strange particle production is discussed. A\nmicroscopic scenario of constituent interactions developed within the z-scaling\napproach is used to study constituent energy loss, proton momentum fraction and\nrecoil mass in dependence on the transverse momentum, strangeness, and mass of\nthe inclusive particle. The obtained results can be useful for understanding\nstrangeness origin, for searching for new physics with strange probes and can\nserve as a benchmark for complex analyses of self-similar features of strange\nproduction in heavy ion collisions.\n", "  Semi-annihilation is a generic feature of dark matter theories with\nsymmetries larger than Z2. We investigate two examples with multi-component\ndark sectors comprised of an SU(2)L singlet or triplet fermion besides a scalar\nsinglet. These are respectively the minimal fermionic semi-annihilating model,\nand the minimal case for a gauge-charged fermion. We study the relevant dark\nmatter phenomenology, including the interplay of semi-annihilation and the\nSommerfeld effect. We demonstrate that semi-annihilation in the singlet model\ncan explain the gamma ray excess from the galactic center. For the triplet\nmodel we scan the parameter space, and explore how signals and constraints are\nmodified by semi-annihilation. We find that the entire region where the model\ncomprises all the observed dark matter is accessible to current and planned\ndirect and indirect searches.\n", "  We study the application of one nanoring driven by a laser field in different\nstates of polarization in logic circuits. In particular we show that assigning\nboolean values to different state of the incident laser field and to the\nemitted signals, we can create logic gates such as OR, XOR and AND. We also\nshow the possibility to make logic circuits such as half-adder and full-adder\nusing one and two nanoring respectively. Using two nanorings we made the\nToffoli gate. Finally we use the final angular momentum acquired by the\nelectron to store information and hence show the possibility to use an array of\nnanorings as a mass memory device.\n", "  The concept of z-scaling previously developed for analysis of inclusive\nreactions in proton-proton collisions is applied for description of processes\nwith polarized particles. Hypothesis of self-similarity of the proton spin\nstructure is discussed. The possibility of extracting information on\nspin-dependent fractal dimensions of hadrons and fragmentation process from the\ncross sections and asymmetries is justified. The double longitudinal spin\nasymmetry A_{LL} of jet and pi0-meson production and the coefficient of\npolarization transfer D_{LL} measured in proton-proton collisions at sqrt s =\n200 GeV at RHIC are analyzed in the framework of z-scaling. The spin-dependent\nfractal dimension of proton is estimated.\n", "  We present a high-precision mass model of the galaxy cluster\nMACSJ1149.6+2223, based on a strong-gravitational-lensing analysis of Hubble\nSpace Telescope Frontier Fields (HFF) imaging data and spectroscopic follow-up\nwith Gemini/GMOS and VLT/MUSE. Our model includes 12 new multiply imaged\ngalaxies, bringing the total to 22, comprised of 65 individual lensed images.\nUnlike the first two HFF clusters, Abell 2744 and MACSJ0416.1-2403, MACSJ1149\ndoes not reveal as many multiple images in the HFF data. Using the Lenstool\nsoftware package and the new sets of multiple images, we model the cluster with\nseveral cluster-scale dark-matter halos and additional galaxy-scale halos for\nthe cluster members. Consistent with previous analyses, we find the system to\nbe complex, composed of five cluster-scale halos. Their spatial distribution\nand lower mass, however, makes MACSJ1149 a less powerful lens. Our best-fit\nmodel predicts image positions with an RMS of 0.91\". We measure the total\nprojected mass inside a 200~kpc aperture as ($1.840\\pm 0.006$)$\\times\n10^{14}$M$_{\\odot}$, thus reaching again 1% precision, following our previous\nHFF analyses of MACSJ0416.1-2403 and Abell 2744. In light of the discovery of\nthe first resolved quadruply lensed supernova, SN Refsdal, in one of the\nmultiply imaged galaxies identified in MACSJ1149, we use our revised mass model\nto investigate the time delays and predict the rise of the next image between\nNovember 2015 and January 2016.\n", "  Using the nine-year radio-pulsar timing data set from the North American\nNanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav), collected at Arecibo\nObservatory and the Green Bank Telescope, we have measured the positions,\nproper motions, and parallaxes for 37 millisecond pulsars. We report twelve\nsignificant parallax measurements and distance measurements, and eighteen lower\nlimits on distance. We compare these measurements to distances predicted by the\nNE2001 interstellar electron density model and find them to be in general\nagreement. We use measured orbital-decay rates and spin-down rates to confirm\ntwo of the parallax distances and to place distance upper limits on other\nsources; these distance limits agree with the parallax distances with one\nexception, PSR J1024-0719, which we discuss at length. Using the proper motions\nof the 37 NANOGrav pulsars in combination with other published measurements, we\ncalculate the velocity dispersion of the millisecond pulsar population in\nGalactocentric coordinates. We find the radial, azimuthal, and perpendicular\ndispersions to be 46, 40, and 24 km s-1, respectively, in a model that allows\nfor high-velocity outliers; or 81, 58, and 62 km s-1 for the full population.\nThese velocity dispersions are far smaller than those of the canonical pulsar\npopulation, and are similar to older Galactic disk populations. This suggests\nthat millisecond pulsar velocities are largely attributable to their being an\nold population rather than being artifacts of their birth and evolution as\nneutron star binary systems. The components of these velocity dispersions\nfollow similar proportions to other Galactic populations, suggesting that our\nresults are not biased by selection effects.\n", "  We compute the $N=2$ R\\'enyi entanglement entropy of two intervals at equal\ntime in a circle, for the theory of a 2d compact complex free scalar at finite\ntemperature. This is carried out by performing functional integral on a genus 3\nramified cover of the torus, wherein the quantum part of the integral is\ncaptured by the four point function of twist fields on the worldsheet torus,\nand the classical piece is given by summing over winding modes of the genus 3\nsurface onto the target space torus. The final result is given in terms of a\nproduct of theta function and certain multi-dimensional theta function. We\ndemonstrate the T-duality invariance of the result. We also study its low\ntemperature limit. In the case in which the size of the intervals and of their\nseparation are much smaller than the whole system, our result is in exact\nagreement with the known result for two intervals on an infinite system at zero\ntemperature \\cite{eeoftwo}. In the case in which the separation between the two\nintervals is much smaller than the interval length, the leading thermal\ncorrections take the same universal form as proposed in\n\\cite{Cardy:2014jwa,Chen:2015cna} for R\\'enyi entanglement entropy of a single\ninterval.\n", "  We present statistical properties of diffuse Lyman-alpha halos (LAHs) around\nhigh-$z$ star-forming galaxies with large Subaru samples of Lyman-alpha\nemitters (LAEs) at $z=2.2$. We make subsamples defined by the physical\nquantities of LAEs' central Lyman-alpha luminosities, UV magnitudes,\nLyman-alpha equivalent widths, and UV slopes, and investigate LAHs' radial\nsurface brightness (SB) profiles and scale lengths $r_n$ as a function of these\nphysical quantities. We find that there exist prominent LAHs around LAEs with\nfaint Lyman-alpha luminosities, bright UV luminosities, and small Lyman-alpha\nequivalent widths in cumulative radial Lyman-alpha SB profiles. We confirm this\ntrend with the anti-correlation between $r_n$ and Lyman-alpha luminosities\n(equivalent widths) based on the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient that\nis $\\rho=-0.9$ ($-0.7$) corresponding to the $96\\%$ ($93\\%$) confidence level,\nalthough the correlation between $r_n$ and UV magnitudes is not clearly found\nin the rank correlation coefficient. Our results suggest that LAEs with\nproperties similar to typical Lyman-break galaxies (with faint Lyman-alpha\nluminosities and small equivalent widths) possess more prominent LAHs. We\ninvestigate scenarios for the major physical origins of LAHs with our results,\nand find that the cold stream scenario is not preferred, due to the relatively\nsmall equivalent widths up to $77$\\AA\\ in LAHs that include LAEs' central\ncomponents. There remain two possible scenarios of Lyman-alpha scattering in\ncircum-galactic medium and satellite galaxies that cannot be tested with our\nobservational data.\n", "  We discuss studies of the $Q^2$ dependence of the $f_2(1270)$ and $a_2\n(1320)$ production cross sections in $\\gamma^*(Q^2)\\gamma $ collisions at\ncurrent and coming into operation colliders with a high luminosity. Changing\nthe dominant helicity amplitude occurs in the reactions $\\gamma^*(Q\n^2)\\gamma\\to f_2(1270)$ and $\\gamma^*(Q^2) \\gamma\\to a_2(1320)$ with increasing\n$Q^2$. This is caused by the coming of the QCD asymptotics. It is shown that\nthe transition to the asymptotic behavior of QCD in the amplitudes\n$\\gamma^*(Q^2) \\gamma\\to f_2(1270),a_2(1320)$ is provided by the compensation\nof the contributions of ground vector states $\\rho$ and $\\omega$ in\n$Q^2$-channel with the contributions of their radial excitations.\n", "  A study of the relation between the electrostatic charge density at a point\non a conducting surface and the curvature of the surface (at that point) is\npresented. Two major scientific literature on this topic are reviewed and the\napparent discrepancy between them is resolved. Hence, a step is taken towards\nobtaining a general analytic formula for relating the charge density with\nsurface curvature of conductors. The merit of this formula and its limitations\nare discussed.\n", "  We study the evolution of holographic complexity in various AdS/CFT models\ncontaining cosmological crunch singularities. We find that a notion of\ncomplexity measured by extremal bulk volumes tends to decrease as the\nsingularity is approached in CFT time, suggesting that the corresponding\nquantum states have simpler entanglement structure at the singularity.\n", "  The FONLL general-mass variable-flavour number scheme provides a framework\nfor the matching of a calculation in which a heavy quark is treated as a\nmassless parton to one in which the mass dependence is retained throughout. We\ndescribe how the usual formulation of FONLL can be extended in such a way that\nthe heavy quark parton distribution functions are freely parameterized at some\ninitial scale, rather than being generated entirely perturbatively. We\nspecifically consider the case of deep-inelastic scattering, in view of\napplications to PDF determination, and the possible impact of a fitted charm\nquark distribution on $F_2^c$ is assessed.\n", "  We report the discovery of KELT-4Ab, an inflated, transiting Hot Jupiter\norbiting the brightest component of a hierarchical triple stellar system. The\nhost star is an F star with $T_{\\rm eff}=6206\\pm75$ K, $\\log g=4.108\\pm0.014$,\n$\\left[{\\rm Fe}/{\\rm H}\\right]=-0.116_{-0.069}^{+0.065}$, ${\\rm\nM_*}=1.201_{-0.061}^{+0.067} \\ {\\rm M}_{\\odot}$, and ${\\rm\nR_*}=1.610_{-0.068}^{+0.078} \\ {\\rm R}_{\\odot}$. The best-fit linear ephemeris\nis $\\rm {BJD_{TDB}} = 2456193.29157 \\pm 0.00021 + E\\left(2.9895936 \\pm\n0.0000048\\right)$. With a magnitude of $V\\sim10$, a planetary radius of\n$1.699_{-0.045}^{+0.046} \\ {\\rm R_J}$, and a mass of $0.902_{-0.059}^{+0.060} \\\n{\\rm M_J}$, it is the brightest host among the population of inflated Hot\nJupiters ($R_P > 1.5R_J$), making it a valuable discovery for probing the\nnature of inflated planets. In addition, its existence within a hierarchical\ntriple and its proximity to Earth ($210$ pc) provides a unique opportunity for\ndynamical studies with continued monitoring with high resolution imaging and\nprecision radial velocities. In particular, the motion of the binary stars\naround each other and of both stars around the primary star relative to the\nmeasured epoch in this work should be detectable when it rises in October 2015.\n", "  We introduce a solid material that is itself invisible, possessing identical\nelectromagnetic properties as air (i.e. not a cloak) at a desired frequency.\nSuch a material could provide improved mechanical stability, electrical\nconduction and heat dissipation to a system, without disturbing incident\nelectromagnetic radiation. One immediate application would be towards perfect\nantenna radomes. Unlike cloaks, such a transparent and self-invisible material\nhas yet to be demonstrated. Previous research has shown that a single sphere or\ncylinder coated with plasmonic or dielectric layers can have a dark-state with\nconsiderably suppressed scattering cross-section, due to the destructive\ninterference between two resonances in one of its scattering channels.\nNevertheless, a massive collection of these objects will have an accumulated\nand detectable disturbance to the original field distribution. Here we overcome\nthis bottleneck by lining up the dark-state frequencies in different channels.\nSpecifically, we derive analytically, verify numerically and demonstrate\nexperimentally that deliberately designed corrugated metallic wires can have\nrecord-low scattering amplitudes, achieved by aligning the nodal frequencies of\nthe first two scattering channels. This enables an arbitrary assembly of these\nwires to be omnidirectionally invisible and the effective constitutive\nparameters nearly identical to air. Measured transmission spectra at microwave\nfrequencies reveal indistinguishable results for all the arrangements of the\n3D-printed samples studied.\n", "  Efficient preparation and detection of the motional state of trapped ions is\nimportant in many experiments ranging from quantum computation to precision\nspectroscopy. We investigate the stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP)\ntechnique for the manipulation of motional states in a trapped ion system. The\npresented technique uses a Raman coupling between two hyperfine ground states\nin $^{25}$Mg$^+$, implemented with delayed pulses, which removes a single\nphonon independent of the initial motional state. We show that for a thermal\nstate the STIRAP population transfer is more efficient than a stimulated Raman\nRabi pulse on a motional sideband. In contrast to previous implementations, a\nlarge detuning of more than 200 times the natural linewidth of the transition\nis used. This approach renders STIRAP suitable for atoms in which resonant\nlaser fields would populate fluorescing excited states and thus impede the\nSTIRAP process. We use the technique to measure the wavefunction overlap of\nexcited motional states with the motional ground state. This is an important\napplication for photon recoil spectroscopy and other force sensing applications\nthat utilize the high sensitivity of the motional state of trapped ions to\nexternal fields. Furthermore, a determination of the ground state population\nenables a simple measurement of the ion's temperature.\n", "  Since the discovery of the first transiting hot Jupiters, models have sought\nto explain the anomalously large radii of highly irradiated gas giants. We now\nknow that the size of hot Jupiter radius anomalies scales strongly with a\nplanet's level of irradiation and numerous models like tidal heating, ohmic\ndissipation, and thermal tides have since been developed to help explain these\ninflated radii. In general however, these models can be grouped into two broad\ncategories: 1) models that directly inflate planetary radii by depositing a\nfraction of the incident irradiation into the interior and 2) models that\nsimply slow a planet's radiative cooling allowing it to retain more heat from\nformation and thereby delay contraction. Here we present a new test to\ndistinguish between these two classes of models. Gas giants orbiting at\nmoderate orbital periods around post main sequence stars will experience\nenormous increases their irradiation as their host stars move up the sub-giant\nand red-giant branches. If hot Jupiter inflation works by depositing\nirradiation into the planet's deep interiors then planetary radii should\nincrease in response to the increased irradiation. This means that otherwise\nnon-inflated gas giants at moderate orbital periods >10 days can re-inflate as\ntheir host stars evolve. Here we explore the circumstances that can lead to the\ncreation of these \"re-inflated\" gas giants and examine how the existence or\nabsence of such planets can be used to place unique constraints of the physics\nof the hot Jupiter inflation mechanism. Finally, we explore the prospects for\ndetecting this potentially important undiscovered population of planets.\n", "  We study the impact of structural variations (that is slowly varying geometry\naberrations and internal strain fields) on the width and shape of the\nstimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) resonance in nanoscale waveguides. We\nfind that they lead to an homogeneous resonance broadening through two distinct\nmechanisms: firstly, the acoustic frequency is directly influenced via\nmechanical nonlinearities; secondly, the optical wave numbers are influenced\nvia the opto-mechanical nonlinearity leading to an additional acoustic\nfrequency shift via the phase-matching condition. We find that this second\nmechanism is proportional to the opto-mechanical coupling and, hence, related\nto the SBS-gain itself. It is absent in intra-mode forward SBS, while it plays\na significant role in backward scattering. In backward SBS increasing the\nopto-acoustic overlap beyond a threshold defined by the fabrication tolerances\nwill therefore no longer yield the expected quadratic increase in overall\nStokes amplification. Finally, we illustrate in a numerical example that in\nbackward SBS and inter-mode forward SBS the existence of two broadening\nmechanisms with opposite sign also opens the possibility to compensate the\neffect of geometry-induced broadening. Our results can be transferred to other\nmicro- and nano-structured waveguide geometries such as photonic crystal\nfibres.\n", "  Computer tomography is one of the most promising new methods to image\nabnormal tissues inside the human body. Tomography is also used to position the\npatient accurately before radiation therapy. Hadron therapy for treating cancer\nhas become one of the most advantageous and safe options. In order to fully\nutilize the advantages of hadron therapy, there is a necessity of performing\nradiography with hadrons as well. In this paper we present the development of a\nproton computed tomography system. Our second-generation proton tomography\nsystem consists of two upstream and two downstream trackers made up of fibers\nas active material and a range detector consisting of plastic scintillators. We\npresent details of the detector system, readout electronics, and data\nacquisition system as well as the commissioning of the entire system. We also\npresent preliminary results from the test beam of the range detector.\n", "  The Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) feature in the power spectrum of\ngalaxies provides a standard ruler to measure the accelerated expansion of the\nUniverse. To extract all available information about dark energy, it is\nnecessary to measure a standard ruler in the local, z<0.2, universe where dark\nenergy dominates most the energy density of the Universe. Though the volume\navailable in the local universe is limited, it is just big enough to measure\naccurately the long 100 Mpc/h wave-mode of the BAO. Using cosmological N-body\nsimulations and approximate methods based on Lagrangian perturbation theory, we\nconstruct a suite of a thousand light-cones to evaluate the precision at which\none can measure the BAO standard ruler in the local universe. We find that\nusing the most massive galaxies on the full sky (34,000 sq. deg.), i.e. a\nK(2MASS)<14 magnitude-limited sample, one can measure the BAO scale up to a\nprecision of 4\\% and 1.2\\% using reconstruction). We also find that such a\nsurvey would help to detect the dynamics of dark energy.Therefore, we propose a\n3-year long observational project, named the Low Redshift survey at Calar Alto\n(LoRCA), to observe spectroscopically about 200,000 galaxies in the northern\nsky to contribute to the construction of aforementioned galaxy sample. The\nsuite of light-cones is made available to the public.\n", "  We consider holographic thermalization in the presence of a Weyl correction\nin five dimensional AdS space. We first obtain the Weyl corrected black brane\nsolution perturbatively, up to first order in the coupling. The corresponding\nAdS-Vaidya like solution is then constructed. This is then used to numerically\nanalyze the time dependence of the two point correlation functions and the\nexpectation values of rectangular Wilson loops in the boundary field theory,\nand we discuss how the Weyl correction can modify the thermalization time\nscales in the dual field theory. In this context, the subtle interplay between\nthe Weyl coupling constant and the chemical potential is studied in detail.\n", "  The new minimal supersymmetric standard model (nMSSM), a variant of the\ngeneral next to minimal supersymmetric standard model (NMSSM) without $Z_3$\nsymmetry, features a naturally light singlino with a mass below 75 GeV. In\nlight of the new constraints from LHC Run-1 on the Higgs couplings, sparticles\nsearches and flavour observables, we define the parameter space of the model\nwhich is compatible with both collider and dark matter (DM) properties. Among\nthe regions compatible with these constraints, implemented through NMSSMTools,\nSModelS and MadAnalysis 5, only one with a singlino lightest supersymmetric\nparticle (LSP) with a mass around 5 GeV can explain all the DM abundance of the\nuniverse, while heavier mixed singlinos can only form one of the DM components.\nTypical collider signatures for each region of the parameter space are\ninvestigated. In particular, the decay of the 125 GeV Higgs into light scalars\nand/or pseudoscalars and the decay of the heavy Higgs into charginos and\nneutralinos, provide distinctive signatures of the model. Moreover, the\nsfermion decays usually proceed through heavier neutralinos rather than\ndirectly into the LSP, as the couplings to the singlino are suppressed. We also\nshow that direct detection searches are complementary to collider ones, and\nthat a future ton-scale detector could completely probe the region of parameter\nspace with a LSP mass around 65 GeV.\n", "  In molecular collisions, resonances occur at specific energies where the\ncolliding particles temporarily form quasi-bound complexes, resulting in rapid\nvariations in the energy dependence of scattering cross sections.\nExperimentally, it has proven challenging to observe such scattering\nresonances, especially in differential cross sections. We report the\nobservation of resonance fingerprints in the state-to-state differential cross\nsections for inelastic NO-He collisions in the 13 to 19 cm$^{-1}$ energy range\nwith 0.3 cm$^{-1}$ resolution. The observed structures were in excellent\nagreement with quantum scattering calculations. They were analyzed by\nseparating the resonance contributions to the differential cross sections from\nthe background through a partitioning of the multichannel scattering matrix.\nThis revealed the partial wave composition of the resonances, and their\nevolution during the collision.\n", "  Negative thermal expansion in ZrW2O8 was investigated using a flexibility\nanalysis of ab-initio phonons. It was shown that no previously proposed\nmechanism adequately describes the atomic-scale origin of negative thermal\nexpansion in this material. Instead it was found that NTE in ZrW2O8 is driven,\nnot by a single mechanism, but by wide bands of phonons that resemble\nvibrations of near-rigid WO4 units and Zr-O bonds at low frequency, with\ndeformation of O-W-O and O-Zr-O bond angles steadily increasing with increasing\nNTE phonon frequency. It is asserted that this phenomenon is likely to provide\na more accurate explanation for NTE in many complex systems not yet studied.\n", "  We suggest a new mechanism for the energy loss of fast heavy quarks in\nquark-gluon plasma. This mechanism is based on pion production caused by the\nanomalous chromomagnetic quark-gluon-pion interaction induced by strong\ntopological fluctuations of the gluon fields represented by instantons. We\nfound that this mechanism gives a considerable contribution to the collisional\nenergy loss of a heavy quark in quark-gluon plasma, which shows a nontrivial\nrole of nonperturbative phenomena in strongly interacting quark-gluon plasma.\n", "  An extensive phenomenological study of the Drell-Yan (DY) process in $pp$\ncollisions at various energies is performed in the color dipole framework.\nBesides previously studied $\\gamma^*$ production we have also included the\n$Z^0$ contribution relevant at large dilepton invariant masses. We investigate\nthe DY cross section differential in invariant mass, rapidity and transverse\nmomentum of the dilepton pair in $pp$ collisions at RHIC and LHC. We consider\nthree different phenomenological models for the dipole cross section and found\na reasonable agreement with the available data. As a further test of the color\ndipole formalism, we also study the correlation function in azimuthal angle\nbetween the dilepton pair and a forward pion $\\Delta\\phi$ for different\nenergies, dilepton rapidites and invariant masses. The characteristic\ndouble-peak structure of the correlation function around $\\Delta \\phi\\simeq\n\\pi$ found for very forward pions and low-mass dilepton pairs is sensitive to\nthe saturation effects and can be tested by future DY measurements in $pp$\ncollisions.\n", "  The specific heat for an ideal Bose gas confined in semi-infinite\nmultifilament cables is analyzed. We start with a Bose gas inside a\nsemi-infinite tube of impenetrable walls and finite rectangular cross section.\nThe internal filament structure is created by applying to the gas two, mutually\nperpendicular, Kronig-Penney delta-potentials along the tube cross section,\nwhile particles are free to move perpendicular to the cross section. The energy\nspectrum accessible to the particles is obtained and introduced into the grand\npotential to calculate the specific heat of the system as a function of\ntemperature for different values of the periodic structure parameters such as:\nthe cross section area, the wall impenetrability and the number of filaments.\nThe specific heat as a function of temperature shows at least two maxima and\none minimum. The main difference with respect to the infinite case is that the\npeak associated with the BE condensation becomes a smoothed maximum or in other\nwords, there is not a jump in the specific heat derivative, whose temperature\nno longer represents a critical point.\n", "  We determine constraints on parameters of a single eV-scale light neutrino\nusing IceCube-59 data. Particular emphasis is put on the question whether such\nan analysis can rule out sterile neutrino hints. While important complementary\ninformation is provided, the different dependence on the various sterile\nneutrino mixing angles makes it currently not possible to fully exclude short\nbaseline appearance results or sterile neutrinos in general.\n", "  Yang-Baxter sigma models, proposed by Klimcik and Delduc-Magro-Vicedo, have\nbeen recognized as a powerful framework for studying integrable deformations of\ntwo-dimensional non-linear sigma models. In this short article, as an important\ngeneralization, we review a non-integrable sigma model in the Yang-Baxter sigma\nmodel approach based on [arXiv:1406.2249]. In particular, we discuss a family\nof deformations of the 5D Sasaki-Einstein manifold $T^{1,1}$, instead of the\nstandard deformations of the $5$-sphere S$^5$. For this purpose, we first\ndescribe a novel construction of $T^{1,1}$ as a supercoset, and provide a\nphysical interpretation of this construction from viewpoint of the dual\nKlebanov-Witten field theory. Secondly, we consider a $3$-parameter deformation\nof $T^{1,1}$ by using classical $r$-matrices satisfying the classical\nYang--Baxter equation (CYBE). The resulting metric and NS-NS two-form\ncompletely agree with the ones previously obtained via TsT (T-dual -- shift --\nT-dual) transformations, and contain the Lunin-Maldacena background as a\nspecial case. Our result indicates that what we refer to as the\ngravity/CYBE(Classical Yang-Baxter Equation) correspondence can be extended\nbeyond integrable cosets.\n", "  The existence of the critical point (CP) of strongly interacting matter is\nstill an open problem. An extensive strong interactions program including a\nsearch of the CP and the study of the onset of deconfinement was started by the\nNA61/SHINE experiment at the CERN SPS. A two dimensional scan of the phase\ndiagram scan is performed to search for the CP and to shed light on the phase\ntransition region. This program includes studies of hadron production in\nproton-proton, proton-nucleus and nucleus-nucleus interactions measured in a\nwide range of colliding energy and system size. Correlations between various\nobservables measured at midrapidity as well as in separated rapidity intervals\nare considered as additional and sensitive tools of this phase diagram scan. We\npresent NA61/SHINE results of studies of energy dependence of two-particle\ncorrelations of pseudo-rapidity and azimuthal angle in p+p collisions at the\nSPS and the first results on correlations between multiplicity and mean\ntransverse momentum in 7Be+9Be collisions at 150A GeV/c obtained for separated\npseudo-rapidity intervals (so called long-range correlations). Comparison with\ndata calculations using the EPOS 1.99 model are also discussed.\n", "  We release the next installment of the Stripe 82 X-ray survey point-source\ncatalog, which currently covers 31.3 deg$^2$ of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey\n(SDSS) Stripe 82 Legacy field. In total, 6181 unique X-ray sources are\nsignificantly detected with {\\it XMM-Newton} ($>5\\sigma$) and {\\it Chandra}\n($>4.5\\sigma$). This catalog release includes data from {\\it XMM-Newton} cycle\nAO 13, which approximately doubled the Stripe 82X survey area. The flux limits\nof the Stripe 82X survey are $8.7\\times10^{-16}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$,\n$4.7\\times10^{-15}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$, and $2.1\\times10^{-15}$ erg\ns$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ in the soft (0.5-2 keV), hard (2-10 keV), and full bands\n(0.5-10 keV), respectively, with approximate half-area survey flux limits of\n$5.4\\times10^{-15}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$, $2.9\\times10^{-14}$ erg s$^{-1}$\ncm$^{-2}$, and $1.7\\times10^{-14}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$. We matched the X-ray\nsource lists to available multi-wavelength catalogs, including updated matches\nto the previous release of the Stripe 82X survey; 88\\% of the sample is matched\nto a multi-wavelength counterpart. Due to the wide area of Stripe 82X and rich\nancillary multi-wavelength data, including coadded SDSS photometry,\nmid-infrared {\\it WISE} coverage, near-infrared coverage from UKIDSS and VHS,\nultraviolet coverage from {\\it GALEX}, radio coverage from FIRST, and\nfar-infrared coverage from {\\it Herschel}, as well as existing $\\sim$30\\%\noptical spectroscopic completeness, we are beginning to uncover rare objects,\nsuch as obscured high-luminosity AGN at high-redshift. The Stripe 82X point\nsource catalog is a valuable dataset for constraining how this population grows\nand evolves, as well as for studying how they interact with the galaxies in\nwhich they live.\n", "  The pygmy dipole resonance and photon strength functions (PSF) in stable and\nunstable Ni and Sn isotopes are calculated within the microscopic\nself-consistent version of the extended theory of finite fermi systems in the\nquasiparticle time blocking approximation. The approach includes phonon\ncoupling (PC) effects in addition to the standard QRPA approach. The Skyrme\nforce SLy4 is used. A pygmy dipole resonance in 72Ni is predicted at the mean\nenergy of 12.4 MeV exhausting 25.7% of the total energy-weighted sum rule. With\nour microscopic E1 PSFs in the EMPIRE 3.1 code, the following radiative nuclear\nreaction characteristics have been calculated for several stable and unstable\neven-even Sn and Ni isotopes: 1) neutron capture cross sections, 2)\ncorresponding neutron capture gamma-spectra, 3) average radiative widths of\nneutron resonances. Here, three variants of the microscopic nuclear level\ndensity models have been used and a comparison with the phenomenological\ngeneralized superfluid model (GSM) has been performed. In all the considered\nproperties, including the recent experimental data for PSF in Sn isotopes, the\nPC contributions turned out to be significant, as compared with the QRPA one,\nand necessary to explain the available experimental data. The phenomenological\nGSM NLD model used in EMPIRE3.1 gives, on the whole, the worse results than the\nmicroscopic HFB plus combinatorial NLD model.\n", "  We generalize a recently discovered example of a private quantum subsystem to\nfind private subsystems for Abelian subgroups of the $n$-qubit Pauli group,\nwhich exist in the absence of private subspaces. In doing so, we also connect\nthese quantum privacy investigations with the theory of quasiorthogonal\noperator algebras through the use of tools from group theory and operator\ntheory.\n", "  A first experimental test of tracking relativistic charged particles by\n`drifting' Cherenkov photons in a water-based optical time-projection chamber\n(OTPC) has been performed at the Fermilab Test Beam Facility. The prototype\nOTPC detector consists of a 77~cm long, 28~cm diameter, 40~kg cylindrical water\nmass instrumented with a combination of commercial $5.1\\times5.1$~cm$^2$\nmicro-channel plate photo-multipliers (MCP-PMT) and $6.7\\times6.7$~cm$^2$\nmirrors. Five MCP-PMTs are installed in two columns along the OTPC cylinder in\na small-angle stereo configuration. A mirror is mounted opposite each MCP-PMT\non the far side of the detector cylinder, effectively doubling the\nphoto-detection efficiency and providing a time-resolved image of the Cherenkov\nlight on the opposing wall. Each MCP-PMT is coupled to an anode readout\nconsisting of thirty 50 Ohm microstrips. A 180-channel data acquisition system\ndigitizes the MCP-PMT signals on one end of the microstrips using the PSEC4\nwaveform sampling-and-digitizing chip operating at a sampling rate of\n10.24~Gigasamples-per-second. The single-ended microstrip readout determines\nthe time and position of a photon arrival at the face of the MCP-PMT by\nrecording both the direct signal and the pulse reflected from the unterminated\nfar end of the strip. The detector was installed on the Fermilab MCenter\nsecondary beam-line behind a steel absorber where the primary flux is multi-GeV\nmuons. Approximately 80 Cherenkov photons are detected for a through-going muon\ntrack in a total event duration of ~2 ns. By measuring the time-of-arrival and\nthe position of individual photons at the surface of the detector to\n$\\le$100~ps and a few mm, respectively, we have measured a spatial resolution\nof $\\sim$ 15~mm for each MCP-PMT track segment, and, from linear fits over the\nentire track length of $\\sim40$~cm, an angular resolution on the track\ndirection of $\\sim60$~mrad.\n", "  Based on the previous works (arXiv:1202.5375 and 1402.1346), we investigate\nthe localization of the fields on the dynamical domain wall, where the four\ndimensional FRW universe is realized on the domain wall in the five dimensional\nspace-time. Especially we show that the chiral spinor can localize on the\ndomain wall, which has not been succeeded in the past works as the seminal work\nin arXiv:0810.3746.\n", "  We characterised and studied, in the radio band, a sample of candidates of\nhigh Rotation Measure (RM). These point-like objects show a strong\ndepolarisation at 21cm. This feature suggests the presence of a very dense\nmedium surrounding them in a combination of a strong magnetic field. This work\naims at selecting and studying a sample of radio sources with high RM, thus to\nstudy their physical conditions and their status with respect to their\nsurrounding medium. We want to understand if any connection is present between\nthe AGN hosting galaxy medium with some evolutionary track and/or some\nrestarting phase of the AGN itself. Multifrequency single-dish observations\nwere performed with the 100-m Effelsberg telescope to define the initial\nsample, to characterise the SED of the final sample (30 targets) and to\ndetermine their RM in the 11 to 2 cm wavelength range. From the observations,\nthe SED together with polarisation information, i.e. the fractional\npolarisation and the polarisation angle, have been determined. Three different\nobject types were revealed from the SEDs analysis: Older, GPS-like and Mixed.\nFor each of the targets, the rotation measure has been found and the\ndepolarisation has been modelled. No significant correlation have been found\nbetween the depolarisation behaviours and the SEDs, while a correlation has\nbeen found between sources with mixed SED (with an old component at low\nfrequency and compact components at high frequencies) and high values of the\nrotation measure (with values in the rest frame larger than 1000 rad/m^2). This\nwork helps us to define and identify a sample of sources with high RM. From the\nanalysis we can conclude that the sources showing a restarting phase at high\nfrequency (with a Mixed SED), are characterised by a really dense and/or a\nmagnetised medium that strongly rotates the polarisation angle at the different\nfrequencies, leading to a high RM.\n", "  A leap forward has been performed due to the space-borne missions, MOST,\nCoRoT and Kepler. They provided a wealth of observational data, and more\nprecisely oscillation spectra, which have been (and are still) exploited to\ninfer the internal structure of stars. While an adiabatic approach is often\nsufficient to get information on the stellar equilibrium structures it is not\nsufficient to get a full understanding of the physics of the oscillation.\nIndeed, it does not permit one to answer some fundamental questions about the\noscillations, such as: What are the physical mechanisms responsible for the\npulsations inside stars? What determines the amplitudes? To what extent the\nadiabatic approximation is valid? All these questions can only be addressed by\nconsidering the energy exchanges between the oscillations and the surrounding\nmedium.\n  This lecture therefore aims at considering the energetical aspects of stellar\npulsations with particular emphasis on the driving and damping mechanisms. To\nthis end, the full non-adiabatic equations are introduced and thoroughly\ndiscussed. Two types of pulsation are distinguished, namely the self-excited\noscillations that result from an instability and the solar-like oscillations\nthat result from a balance between driving and damping by turbulent convection.\nFor each type, the main physical principles are presented and illustrated using\nrecent observations obtained with the ultra-high precision photometry\nspace-borne missions (MOST, CoRoT and Kepler). Finally, we consider in detail\nthe physics of scaling relations, which relates the seismic global indices with\nthe global stellar parameters and gave birth to the development of statistical\n(or ensemble) asteroseismology. Indeed, several of these relations rely on the\nsame cause: the physics of non-adiabatic oscillations.\n", "  Very little is known about how the nature of expertise in introductory and\nadvanced courses compares in knowledge-rich domains such as physics. We develop\na framework to compare the similarities and differences between learning and\npatterns of student difficulties in introductory physics and quantum mechanics.\nBased upon our framework, we argue that the qualitative patterns of student\nreasoning difficulties in introductory physics bear a striking resemblance to\nthose found for upper-level quantum mechanics. The framework can guide the\ndesign of teaching and learning tools.\n", "  Quantum mechanics is challenging even for advanced undergraduate and graduate\nstudents. Dirac notation is a convenient notation used extensively in quantum\nmechanics. We have been investigating the difficulties that the advanced\nundergraduate and graduate students have with Dirac notation. We administered\nwritten free response and multiple-choice questions to students and also\nconducted semi-structured individual interviews with 23 students using a\nthink-aloud protocol to obtain a better understanding of the rationale behind\ntheir responses. We find that many students struggle with Dirac notation and\nthey are not consistent in using this notation across various questions in a\ngiven test. In particular, whether they answer questions involving Dirac\nnotation correctly or not is context dependent.\n", "  Quantum mechanics is challenging even for advanced undergraduate and graduate\nstudents. In the Schr\\\"odinger representation, the wave function evolves in\ntime according to the time dependent Schr\\\"odinger equation. The time\ndependence of the wave function gives rise to time dependence of the\nexpectation value of observables. We have been exploring the difficulties that\nadvanced undergraduate and graduate students have with time dependence of\nexpectation values in quantum mechanics. We have developed and administered\nconceptual free response and multiple-choice questions to students to\ninvestigate these difficulties. We also interviewed 23 students individually\nusing a think-aloud protocol to obtain a better understanding of the rationale\nbehind students' written responses. We find that many students struggle with\ntime dependence of expectation values of observables. We discuss some findings.\n", "  We are developing a quantum interactive learning tutorial (QuILT) on a\nquantum eraser for students in upperlevel quantum mechanics. The QuILT exposes\nstudents to contemporary topics in quantum mechanics and uses a guided approach\nto learning. It adapts existing visualization tools to help students build\nphysical intuition about quantum phenomena and strives to help them develop the\nability to apply quantum principles in physical situations. The quantum eraser\napparatus in the gedanken (thought) experiments and simulations that students\nlearn from in the QuILT uses a MachZehnder Interferometer with single photons.\nWe also discuss findings from a preliminary in-class evaluation.\n", "  We are developing a Quantum Interactive Learning Tutorial (QuILT) on a\nMach-Zehnder Interferometer with single photons to expose upper-level students\nin quantum mechanics courses to contemporary applications. The QuILT strives to\nhelp students develop the ability to apply fundamental quantum principles to\nphysical situations and explore differences between classical and quantum\nideas. The QuILT adapts visualization tools to help students build physical\nintuition about quantum phenomena and focuses on helping them integrate\nqualitative and quantitative understanding. We also discuss findings from a\npreliminary in-class evaluation.\n", "  We calculate the distance-dependent performance of a few representative\nterrestrial neutrino detectors in detecting and measuring the properties of the\n$\\nu_e$ breakout burst light curve in a Galactic core-collapse supernova. The\nbreakout burst is a signature phenomenon of core collapse and offers a probe\ninto the stellar core through collapse and bounce. We examine cases of no\nneutrino oscillations and oscillations due to normal and inverted neutrino-mass\nhierarchies. For the normal hierarchy, other neutrino flavors emitted by the\nsupernova overwhelm the $\\nu_e$ signal, making a detection of the breakout\nburst difficult. For the inverted hierarchy (IH), some detectors at some\ndistances should be able to see the $\\nu_e$ breakout burst peak and measure its\nproperties. For the IH, the maximum luminosity of the breakout burst can be\nmeasured at 10 kpc to accuracies of $\\sim$30% for Hyper-Kamiokande (Hyper-K)\nand $\\sim$60% for the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE).\nSuper-Kamiokande (Super-K) and Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO)\nlack the mass needed to make an accurate measurement. For the IH, the time of\nthe maximum luminosity of the breakout burst can be measured in Hyper-K to an\naccuracy of $\\sim$3 ms at 7 kpc, in DUNE $\\sim$2 ms at 4 kpc, and JUNO and\nSuper-K can measure the time of maximum luminosity to an accuracy of $\\sim$2 ms\nat 1 kpc. Detector backgrounds in IceCube render a measurement of the $\\nu_e$\nbreakout burst unlikely. For the inverted hierarchy, a measurement of the\nmaximum luminosity of the breakout burst could be used to differentiate between\nnuclear equations of state.\n", "  We present a consistent way of combining associated weak boson radiation in\nhard dijet events with hard QCD radiation in Drell-Yan-like scatterings. This\nintegrates multiple tree-level calculations with vastly different cross\nsections, QCD- and electroweak parton shower resummation into a single\nframework. The new merging strategy is implemented in the PYTHIA event\ngenerator and predictions are confronted with LHC data. Improvements over the\nprevious strategy are observed. Results of the new electroweak-improved merging\nat a future 100 TeV proton collider are also investigated.\n", "  We study the bulk and boundary scattering of the sl(N) twisted Yangian spin\nchain via the solution of the Bethe ansatz equations in the thermodynamic\nlimit. Explicit expressions for the scattering amplitudes are obtained and the\nfactorization of the bulk scattering is shown. The issue of defects in twisted\nYangians is also briefly discussed.\n", "  First results of study of a soft photon yield at Nuclotron (LHEP, JINR) in\nnucleus-nucleus collisions at 3.5 GeV per nucleon are presented. These photons\nare registered by an BGO electromagnetic calorimeter built by SVD-2\nCollaboration. The obtained spectra confirm the excessive yield in the energy\nregion less than 50 MeV in comparison with theoretical estimations and agree\nwith previous experiments at high-energy interactions.\n", "  Aiming at studying the mechanism of photo-excited precession of magnetization\nin ferromagnetic (Ga,Mn)As, magneto-optical (MO) and differential reflectivity\n(DR) temporal profiles are studied at relatively long and ultra-short time\nscales for samples with different Mn contents (x=0.01-0.11). As to the\noscillatory MO profiles observed in the long time scale, simulation based on\nthe LLG equation combined with two different MO effects confirms\nphoto-inducement of the perpendicular anisotropy component p-Heff. As for the\nprofiles observed in the ultra-short time scale, they are consistently\nexplained in terms of the dynamics of photo-generated carriers, but not by the\nsudden reduction in magnetization. With those experimental results and\nanalyses, new mechanism which accounts for the photo-induced p-Heff is\naddressed; photo-ionization like excitation of Mn(II). Namely, Mn(II) is\nexcited into Mn(III) and e . It is discussed that such excitation tips magnetic\nanisotropy toward the out-of-plane direction through the inducement of orbital\nangular momentum and the gradient dMn(II*)/dz. Validity of the proposed\nmechanism is examined by estimating the efficiency of excitation on the basis\nof the Lambert-Beer law and the experimental p-Heff values, through which the\nefficiency of 1-10 ppm with the nominal optical cross section of around 5 x\n10^12 m^2 are obtained.\n", "  Among colossal magnetoresistive manganites the prototypical ferromagnetic\nmanganite La$_{0.7}$Sr$_{0.3}$MnO$_{3}$ has a relatively small\nmagnetoresistance, and has been long assumed to have only weak electron-lattice\ncoupling. Here we report that La$_{0.7}$Sr$_{0.3}$MnO$_{3}$ has strong\nelectron-phonon coupling: Our neutron and x-ray scattering experiments show\nstrong softening and broadening of transverse acoustic phonons on heating\nthrough the Curie temperature T$_C$ = 350 K. Simultaneously, we observe two\nphases where metallic resistivity and polarons coexist. The ferromagnetic\npolaronic metal phase between 200 K and T$_C$ is characterized by quasielastic\nscattering from dynamic CE-type polarons with the relatively short lifetime of\n$\\mathbf{\\tau}\\approx 1\\,\\rm{ps}$. This scattering is greatly enhanced above\nT$_C$ in the paramagnetic polaronic metal phase. Our results suggest that the\nstrength of magnetoresistance in manganites scales with the inverse of polaron\nlifetime, not the strength of electron-phonon coupling.\n", "  Mean field calculations, based on the D1S, D1N and D1M parametrizations of\nthe Gogny energy density functional, have been carried out to obtain the\npotential energy surfaces relevant to fission in several Ra isotopes with the\nneutron number 144 $\\le$ N $\\le$ 176. Inner and outer barrier heights as well\nas first and second isomer excitation energies are given. The existence of a\nwell developed third minimum along the fission paths of Ra nuclei, is analyzed\nin terms of the energetics of the \"fragments\" defining such elongated\nconfiguration. The masses and charges of the fission fragments are studied as\nfunctions of the neutron number in the parent Ra isotope. The comparison\nbetween fission and $\\alpha$-decay half-lives, reveals that the former becomes\nfaster for increasing neutron numbers. Though there exists a strong variance of\nthe results with respect to the parameters used in the computation of the\nspontaneous fission rate, a change in tendency is observed at N=164 with a\nsteady increase that makes heavier neutron-rich Ra isotopes stable against\nfission, diminishing the importance of fission recycling in the r-process.\n", "  The vibrational properties of model amorphous materials are studied by\ncombining complete analysis of the vibration modes, dynamical structure factor\nand energy diffusivity with exact diagonalization of the dynamical matrix and\nthe Kernel Polynomial Method which allows a study of very large system sizes.\nDifferent materials are studied that differ only by the bending rigidity of the\ninteractions in a Stillinger-Weber modelization used to describe amorphous\nsilicon. The local bending rigidity can thus be used as a control parameter, to\ntune the sound velocity together with local bonds directionality. It is shown\nthat for all the systems studied, the upper limit of the Boson peak corresponds\nto the Ioffe-Regel criterion for transverse waves, as well as to a minimum of\nthe diffusivity. The Boson peak is followed by a diffusivity's increase\nsupported by longitudinal phonons. The Ioffe-Regel criterion for transverse\nwaves corresponds to a common characteristic mean-free path of 5-7 \\AA{} (which\nis slightly bigger for longitudinal phonons), while the fine structure of the\nvibrational density of states is shown to be sensitive to the local bending\nrigidity.\n", "  At the tree level, the scattering processes involving open and closed strings\nare described by a disk world-sheet with vertex operator insertions at the\nboundary and in the bulk. Such amplitudes can be decomposed as certain linear\ncombinations of pure open string amplitudes. While previous relations have been\nestablished on the double cover (complex sphere) in this letter we derive them\non the disk (upper complex half plane) allowing for different momenta of the\nleft- and right-movers of the closed string. Formally, the computation of disk\namplitudes involving both open and closed strings is reduced to considering the\nmonodromies on the underlying string world-sheet.\n", "  I give a brief overview of the recent theoretical progress in the study of\nquarkonium production in proton-nucleus collisions in view of the recent LHC\nand RHIC results. A special emphasis is put on the excited states such as the\npsi', Upsilon(2S) and Upsilon(3S).\n", "  In systems exhibiting fluctuation-dominated phase ordering, a single order\nparameter does not suffice to characterize the order, and it is necessary to\nmonitor a larger set. For hard-core sliding particles (SP) on a fluctuating\nsurface and the related coarse-grained depth (CD) models, this set comprises\nthe long-wavelength Fourier components of the density profile. We study both\nstatic and dynamic scaling laws obeyed by the Fourier modes $Q_m$ and find that\nthe mean value obeys the static scaling law $\\langle Q_m \\rangle \\sim\nL^{-\\phi}f(m/L)$ with $\\phi\\simeq2/3$ and $\\phi \\simeq 3/5$ with\nEdwards-Wilkinson (EW) and Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) surface evolution\nrespectively. The full probability distribution $P(Q_m)$ exhibits scaling as\nwell. Further, time-dependent correlation functions such as the steady state\nauto-correlation and cross-correlations of order parameter components are\nscaling functions of $t/L^z$, where $L$ is the system size and $z$ is the\ndynamic exponent with $z=2$ for EW and $z=3/2$ for KPZ surface evolution. In\naddition we find that the CD model shows temporal intermittency, manifested in\nthe dynamical structure functions of the density and a weak divergence of the\nflatness as the scaled time approaches zero.\n", "  We describe the fabrication of homogeneous sub-stoichiometric titanium\nnitride films for microwave kinetic inductance detector (mKID) arrays. Using a\n6 inch sputtering target and a homogeneous nitrogen inlet, the variation of the\ncritical temperature over a 2 inch wafer was reduced to <25 %. Measurements of\na 132-pixel mKID array from these films reveal a sensitivity of 16 kHz/pW in\nthe 100 GHz band, comparable to the best aluminium mKIDs. We measured a noise\nequivalent power of NEP = 3.6e-15 W/Hz^(1/2). Finally, we describe possible\nroutes to further improve the performance of these TiN mKID arrays.\n", "  The linear dynamics of Alfven modes in tokamaks is investigated here by means\nof the global gyrokinetic particle-in-cell code NEMORB. The model equations are\nshown and the local shear Alfven wave dispersion relation is derived,\nrecovering the continuous spectrum in the incompressible ideal MHD limit. A\nverification and benchmark analysis is performed for continuum modes in a\ncylinder and for toroidicity-induced Alfven Eigenmodes. Modes in a\nreversed-shear equilibrium are also investigated, and the dependence of the\nspatial structure in the poloidal plane on the equilibrium parameters is\ndescribed. In particular, a phase-shift in the poloidal angle is found to be\npresent for modes whose frequency touches the continuum, whereas a radial\nsymmetry is found to be characteristic of modes in the continuum gap.\n", "  We study a realization of light dilatons by considering Conformal Field\nTheories deformed by a nearly marginal operator ${\\cal O}$. This is discussed\nin the holographic setup consisting of Renormalization Group flows that end on\na soft wall. We obtain a mass formula for the dilaton as an average along the\nflow. Finally we discuss the holographic method to compute the condensate\n$\\langle {\\cal O} \\rangle$.\n", "  Interacting Bose-Fermi systems play a central role in condensed matter\nphysics. Here, we analyze a novel Bose-Fermi mixture formed by a cavity\nexciton-polariton condensate interacting with a two-dimensional electron\nsystem. We show that that previous predictions of superconductivity [F.P.\nLaussy, Phys. Rev. Lett. 10, 104 (2010)] and excitonic supersolid formation\n[I.A. Shelykh, Phys. Rev. Lett. 14, 105 (2010)] in this system are closely\nintertwined- resembling the predictions for strongly correlated electron\nsystems such as high temperature superconductors. In stark contrast to a large\nmajority of Bose-Fermi systems analyzed in solids and ultracold atomic gases,\nthe renormalized interaction between the polaritons and electrons in our system\nis long-ranged and strongly peaked at a tunable wavevector, which can be\nrendered incommensurate with the Fermi momentum. We analyze the prospects for\nexperimental observation of superconductivity and find that critical\ntemperatures on the order of a few Kelvins can be achieved in heterostructures\nconsisting of transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers that are embedded in\nan open cavity structure. All optical control of superconductivity in\nsemiconductor heterostructures could enable the realization of new device\nconcepts compatible with semiconductor nanotechnology. In addition the\npossibility to interface quantum Hall physics, superconductivity and\nnonequilibrium polariton condensates is likely to provide fertile ground for\ninvestigation of completely new physical phenomena.\n", "  We present studies of strange particle yields and correlations in $pp$\ncollisions in the PYTHIA8 event generator by studying forward-backward\ncorrelations. Several key processes that give rise to these correlative effects\nare identified and manipulated to probe the fundamental properties of strange\nparticle emitting sources. The sensitivity of strange particle production and\ncorrelations to PYTHIA's multiparton interaction, color reconnection, and\nexplicit strangeness suppression are shown.\n", "  We use the finite amplitude method for computing charge-changing Skyrme-QRPA\ntransition strengths in axially-deformed nuclei together with a modern Skyrme\nenergy-density functional to fit several previously unconstrained parameters in\nthe charge-changing time-odd part of the functional. With the modified\nfunctional we then calculate rates of beta-minus decay for all medium-mass and\nheavy even-even nuclei between the valley of stability and the neutron drip\nline. We fit the Skyrme parameters to a limited set of beta-decay rates, a set\nof Gamow-Teller resonance energies, and a set of spin-dipole resonance\nenergies, in both spherical and deformed nuclei. Comparison to available\nexperimental beta-decay rates shows agreement at roughly the same level as in\nother global QRPA calculations. We estimate the uncertainty in our rates all\nthe way to the neutron drip line through a construction that extrapolates the\nerrors of known beta-decay rates in nuclei with intermediate Q values to less\nstable isotopes with higher Q values.\n", "  The incidence of rare events in fast-slow systems is investigated via\nanalysis of the large deviation principle (LDP) that characterizes the\nlikelihood and pathway of large fluctuations of the slow variables away from\ntheir mean behavior -- such fluctuations are rare on short timescales but\nbecome ubiquitous eventually. This LDP involves an Hamilton-Jacobi equation\nwhose Hamiltonian is related to the leading eigenvalue of the generator of the\nfast process, and is typically non-quadratic in the momenta -- in other words,\nthe LDP for the slow variables in fast-slow systems is different in general\nfrom that of any stochastic differential equation (SDE) one would write for the\nslow variables alone. It is shown here that the eigenvalue problem for the\nHamiltonian can be reduced to a simpler algebraic equation for this Hamiltonian\nfor a specific class of systems in which the fast variables satisfy a linear\nequation whose coefficients depend nonlinearly on the slow variables, and the\nfast variables enter quadratically the equation for the slow variables. These\nresults are illustrated via examples, inspired by kinetic theories of turbulent\nflows and plasma, in which the quasipotential characterizing the long time\nbehavior of the system is calculated and shown again to be different from that\nof an SDE.\n", "  We present an ongoing project aimed at determining the thermodynamic Equation\nof State (EoS) of quark--gluon matter from lattice QCD with two generations of\ndynamical quarks. We employ the Wilson twisted mass implementation for the\nfermionic fields and the improved Iwasaki gauge action. Relying on $T=0$ data\nobtained by the ETM Collaboration the strange and charm quark masses are fixed\nat their physical values, while the pion mass takes four values in the range\nfrom 470 MeV down to 210 MeV. The temperature is varied within a fixed--lattice\nscale approach. The values for the pseudocritical temperature are obtained from\nvarious observables. For the EoS we show preliminary results for the pure\ngluonic contribution obtained at the pion mass value 370 MeV, where we can\ncompare with previously obtained results with $N_f=2$ degenerate light\nflavours.\n", "  We present results for the topological susceptibility at nonzero temperature\nobtained from lattice QCD with four dynamical quark flavours. We apply\ndifferent smoothing methods, including gradient Wilson flow and over--improved\ncooling, before calculating the susceptibility. It is shown that the considered\nsmoothing techniques basically agree among each other, and that there are\nsimple scaling relations between flow time and the number of cooling/smearing\nsteps. The topological susceptibility exhibits a surprisingly slow decrease at\nhigh temperature.\n", "  Type Ia supernovae luminosities can be corrected to render them useful as\nstandard candles able to probe the expansion history of the universe. This\ntechnique was successful applied to discover the present acceleration of the\nuniverse. As the number of SNe Ia observed at high redshift increases and\nanalysis techniques are perfected, people aim to use this technique to probe\nthe equation of state of the dark energy. Nevertheless, the nature of SNe Ia\nprogenitors remains controversial and concerns persist about possible evolution\neffects that may be larger and harder to characterize than the more obvious\nstatistical uncertainties.\n", "  HD~106906AB is so far the only young binary system around which a planet has\nbeen imaged and a debris disk evidenced thanks to a strong IR excess. As such,\nit represents a unique opportunity to study the dynamics of young planetary\nsystems. We aim at further investigating the close (tens of au scales)\nenvironment of the HD~106906AB system. We used the extreme AO fed, high\ncontrast imager SPHERE recently installed on the VLT to observe HD~106906. Both\nthe IRDIS imager and the Integral Field Spectrometer were used. We discovered a\nvery inclined, ring-like disk at a distance of 65~au from the star. The disk\nshows a strong brightness asymmetry with respect to its semi-major axis. It\nshows a smooth outer edge, compatible with ejection of small grains by the\nstellar radiation pressure. We show furthermore that the planet's projected\nposition is significantly above the disk's PA. Given the determined disk\ninclination, it is not excluded though that the planet could still orbit within\nthe disk plane if at a large separation (2000--3000 au). We identified several\nadditional point sources in the SPHERE/IRDIS field-of-view, that appear to be\nbackground objects. We compare this system with other debris disks sharing\nsimilarities, and we briefly discuss the present results in the framework of\ndynamical evolution.\n", "  Electron spin resonance (ESR) is usually interpreted as a single-particle\nphenomenon protected from the effect of many-body correlations. We show that\nthis is not the case in a two-dimensional Fermi liquid (FL) with spin-orbit\ncoupling (SOC). Depending on whether the magnetic field is below or above some\ncritical value, ESR in such a system probes up to three collective chiral-spin\nmodes, augmented by the presence of the field, or the Larmor mode, augmented\nboth by SOC and FL renormalizations. We argue that ESR can be used as a probe\nnot only for SOC but also for many-body physics.\n", "  Arm-locking is a technique for stabilizing the frequency of a laser in an\ninter-spacecraft interferometer by using the spacecraft separation as the\nfrequency reference. A candidate technique for future space-based gravitational\nwave detectors such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA),\narm-locking has been extensive studied in this context through analytic models,\ntime-domain simulations, and hardware-in-the-loop laboratory demonstrations. In\nthis paper we show the Laser Ranging Interferometer instrument flying aboard\nthe upcoming Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment Follow-On (GRACE-FO)\nmission provides an appropriate platform for an on-orbit demonstration of the\narm-locking technique. We describe an arm-locking controller design for the\nGRACE-FO system and a series of time-domain simulations that demonstrate its\nfeasibility. We conclude that it is possible to achieve laser frequency noise\nsuppression of roughly two orders of magnitude around a Fourier frequency of\n1Hz with conservative margins on the system's stability. We further demonstrate\nthat `pulling' of the master laser frequency due to fluctuating Doppler shifts\nand lock acquisition transients is less than $100\\,$MHz over several GRACE-FO\norbits. These findings motivate further study of the implementation of such a\ndemonstration.\n", "  This paper considers a nonlinear coupling between a radial and a nonradial\nmode of nearly the same frequency. The results may be of general interest, but\nin particular have application to the \"beating-modes model\" of the Blazhko\neffect which was recently shown to accurately reproduce the light curve of RR\nLyr. For weak coupling, the two modes do not phase-lock and they retain\nseparate frequencies, but the coupling nevertheless has important consequences.\nUpon increasing the coupling strength from zero, an additional side-peak\nemerges in the spectrum forming an asymmetric triplet centered on the\nfundamental. As the coupling is further increased, the amplitude of this\nside-peak increases and the three peaks are also pulled towards each other,\ndecreasing the Blazhko frequency. Beyond a critical coupling strength,\nphase-locking occurs between the modes. With appropriate choice of coupling\nstrength, this \"interactive beating-modes model\" can match the side-peak\namplitude ratio of any star. The effects of nonlinear damping are also explored\nand found to generate additional side-peaks of odd order. Consistent with this,\nthe odd side-peaks are found to be favored in V808 Cyg. It is also shown that\nthe Blazhko effect generates a fluctuating \"environment\" that can have a\nmodulatory effect on other excited modes of the star. An example is found in\nV808 Cyg where the modulation is at double the Blazhko frequency. An\nexplanation is found for this mysterious doubling, providing additional\nevidence in favor of the model.\n", "  We study exactly the effect of an impurity in the interacting quantum spin\nchain at low temperature by solving the integrable spin-1/2 XXZ periodic chain\nwith an impurity through the algebraic and thermal Bethe ansatz methods. In\nparticular, we investigate how the crossover temperature for the impurity\nspecific heat depends on the impurity parameter, i.e. the coupling of the\nimpurity to other spins, and show that it is consistent with the analytic\nexpression that is obtained by setting the impurity susceptibility to be\nproportional to the inverse of the crossover temperature. In the model, two\ntypes of crossover behavior appear: one from the high-temperature regime to the\nlow-temperature Kondo regime and another from the N-site homogeneous chain to\nthe (N-1)-site chain with a decoupled free impurity spin, with respect to the\ntemperature and the impurity parameter, respectively.\n", "  As said by Sir A. Eddington in 1925: Our telescopes may probe farther and\nfarther into the depths of space. At first sight it would seem that the deep\ninterior of the sun and stars is less accessible to scientific investigation\nthan any other region of the universe. What appliance can pierce through the\nouter layers of a star and test the conditions within? Eddington (1926).\nNowadays, asteroseismology has proven its ability to pierce below stellar pho-\ntospheres and allow us to see inside the interior of thousands of stars down to\nthe stellar cores, answering the question asked by Eddington ninety years ago.\nIn this chapter we review the general properties of the spectral analysis which\nis the base of any asteroseismic investigation. After describing the stellar\npower spectrum, we will describe in details the characterization of the modal\nspec- trum. This chapter will end by a brief description of the instrumentation\nin both helio and asteroseismology.\n", "  The detection of $\\rm z>6$ quasars reveals the existence of supermassive\nblack holes of a few $\\rm 10^9~M_{\\odot}$. One of the potential pathways to\nexplain their formation in the infant universe is the so-called direct collapse\nmodel which provides massive seeds of $\\rm 10^5-10^6~M_{\\odot}$. An isothermal\ndirect collapse mandates that halos should be of a primordial composition and\nthe formation of molecular hydrogen remains suppressed in the presence of a\nstrong Lyman Werner flux. In this study, we perform high resolution\ncosmological simulations for two massive primordial halos employing a detailed\nchemical model which includes $\\rm H^-$ cooling as well as realistic opacities\nfor both the bound-free $\\rm H^-$ emission and the Rayleigh scattering of\nhydrogen atoms. We are able to resolve the collapse up to unprecedentedly high\ndensities of $\\rm \\sim 10^{-3}~g/cm^3$ and to scales of about $\\rm 10^{-4}$ AU.\nOur results show that the gas cools down to $\\rm \\sim $ 5000 K in the presence\nof $\\rm H^-$ cooling, and induces fragmentation at scales of about 8000 AU in\none of the two simulated halos, which may lead to the formation of a binary. In\naddition, fragmentation also occurs on the AU scale in one of the halos but the\nclumps are expected to merge on short time scales. Our results confirm that\n$\\rm H^-$ cooling does not prevent the formation of a supermassive star and the\ntrapping of cooling radiation stabilises the collapse on small scales.\n", "  Reverberation mapping (RM) measurements of broad-line region (BLR) lags in\nz>0.3 quasars are important for directly measuring black hole masses in these\ndistant objects, but so far there have been limited attempts and success given\nthe practical difficulties of RM in this regime. Here we report preliminary\nresults of 15 BLR lag measurements from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey\nReverberation Mapping (SDSS-RM) project, a dedicated RM program with\nmulti-object spectroscopy designed for RM over a wide redshift range. The lags\nare based on the 2014 spectroscopic light curves alone (32 epochs over 6\nmonths) and focus on the Hbeta and MgII broad lines in the 100 lowest-redshift\n(z<0.8) quasars included in SDSS-RM; they represent a small subset of the lags\nthat SDSS-RM (including 849 quasars to z~4.5) is expected to deliver. The\nreported preliminary lag measurements are for intermediate-luminosity quasars\nat 0.3<~z<0.8, including 9 Hbeta lags and 6 MgII lags, for the first time\nextending RM results to this redshift-luminosity regime and providing direct\nquasar black hole mass estimates over ~ half of cosmic time. The MgII lags also\nincrease the number of known MgII lags by several-fold, and start to explore\nthe utility of MgII for RM at high redshift. The location of these new lags at\nhigher redshifts on the observed BLR size-luminosity relationship is\nstatistically consistent with previous Hbeta results at z<0.3. However, an\nindependent constraint on the relationship slope at z>0.3 is not yet possible\ndue to the limitations in our current sample. Our results demonstrate the\ngeneral feasibility and potential of multi-object RM for z>0.3 quasars.\n", "  We construct single input logic gates using the energy sharing collisions of\na minimal number of (three) bright optical solitons associated with the three\nsoliton solution of the integrable Manakov system. As computation requires\nstate changes to represent binary logic, here we make use of the state change\nof a particular soliton during its sequential collision with other two solitons\nfor constructing single input gates. As a consequence, we clearly demonstrate\nthe construction of various one-input logic gates such as COPY gate, NOT gate\nand ONE gate using energy sharing three soliton collision of Manakov system.\nThis type of realization of logic gates just from a three soliton collision\n(pair-wise interaction) is clearly distinct from the earlier studies which\nrequire separate collisions of four solitons.\n", "  We consider the motion of a particle along the geodesic lines of the\nPoincar\\`e half-plane. The particle is specularly reflected when it hits\nrandomly-distributed obstacles that are assumed to be motionless. This is the\nhyperbolic version of the well-known Lorentz Process studied by Gallavotti in\nthe Euclidean context. We analyse the limit in which the density of the\nobstacles increases to infinity and the size of each obstacle vanishes: under a\nsuitable scaling, we prove that our process converges to a Markovian process,\nnamely a random flight on the hyperbolic manifold.\n", "  Starting from the (Polyakov-) Nambu-Jona-Lasinio Lagrangian, (P)NJL, we\nformulate a transport theory which allows for describing the expansion of a\nquark-antiquark plasma and the subsequent transition to the hadronic world\n--without adding any new parameter to the standard (P)NJL approach, whose\nparameters are fixed to vacuum physics. This transport theory can be used to\ndescribe ultrarelativistic heavy-ion reaction data as well as to study the\n(first-order) phase transition during the expansion of the plasma. (P)NJL\npredicts such a phase transition for finite chemical potentials. In this\ncontribution we give an outline of the necessary steps to obtain such a\ntransport theory and present first results.\n", "  The time-dependent version of nuclear density functional theory, using\nfunctionals derived from Skyrme interactions, is able to approximately describe\nnuclear dynamics. We present time-dependent results of calculations of dipole\nresonances, concentrating on excitations of valence neutrons against a proton\nplus neutron core in the neutron-rich doubly-magic $^{132}$Sn nucleus, and\nresults of collision dynamics, highlighting potential routes to ternary fusion,\nwith the example of a collision of $^{48}$Ca+$^{48}$Ca+$^{208}$Pb resulting in\na compound nucleus of element 120 stable against immiedate fission\n", "  The scientific apparatus \"Gamma-400\" designed for study of hadron and\nelectromagnetic components of cosmic rays will be launched to an elliptic orbit\nwith the apogee of about 300 000 km and the perigee of about 500 km. Such a\nconfiguration of the orbit allows it to cross periodically the radiation belt\nand the outer part of magnetosphere. We discuss the possibility to use hybrid\npixel detecters based on the Timepix chip and semiconductive sensors on board\nthe \"Gamma-400\" apparatus. Due to high granularity of the sensor (pixel size is\n55 $mu$m) and possibility to measure independently an energy deposition in each\npixel, such compact and lightweight detector could be a unique instrument for\nstudy of spatial, energy and time structure of electron and proton components\nof the radiation belt.\n", "  We present the results of the first in-beam studies of a medium size\n(10$\\times$10 cm$^2$) Resistive-Plate WELL (RPWELL): a single-sided THGEM\ncoupled to a pad anode through a resistive layer of high bulk resistivity\n($\\sim$10$^9 \\Omega$cm). The 6.2~mm thick (excluding readout electronics)\nsingle-stage detector was studied with 150~GeV muons and pions. Signals were\nrecorded from 1$\\times$1 cm$^2$ square copper pads with APV25-SRS readout\nelectronics. The single-element detector was operated in Ne\\(5%\n$\\mathrm{CH_{4}}$) at a gas gain of a few times 10$^4$, reaching 99$\\%$\ndetection efficiency at average pad multiplicity of $\\sim$1.2. Operation at\nparticle fluxes up to $\\sim$10$^4$ Hz/cm$^2$ resulted in $\\sim$23$\\%$ gain drop\nleading to $\\sim$5$\\%$ efficiency loss. The striking feature was the\ndischarge-free operation, also in intense pion beams. These results pave the\nway towards robust, efficient large-scale detectors for applications requiring\neconomic solutions at moderate spatial and energy resolutions.\n", "  We show that critical systems of finite size develop a fractal structure in\nmomentum space with anomalous dimension given in terms of the isotherm critical\nexponent delta of the corresponding infinite system. The associated power laws\nof transverse momentum correlations, in high-energy nuclear collisions, provide\nus with a signature of a critical point in strongly interacting matter\naccording to the laws of QCD.\n", "  Previous works show strong winds exist in hot accretion flows around black\nholes. Those works focus only on the region close to the black hole thus it is\nunknown whether or where the wind production stops at large radii. In this\npaper, we investigate this problem by hydrodynamical simulations. We take into\naccount gravities of both the black hole and the nuclear star clusters. For the\nlatter, we assume that the velocity dispersion of stars is a constant and its\ngravitational potential $\\propto \\sigma^2 \\ln (r)$, where $\\sigma$ is the\nvelocity dispersion of stars and $r$ is the distance from the center of the\ngalaxy. We focus on the region where the gravitational potential is dominated\nby the star cluster. We find, same as the accretion flow at small radii, the\nmass inflow rate decreases inward and the flow is convectively unstable.\nHowever, trajectory analysis shows that there is very few wind launched from\nthe flow. Our result, combined with the results of Yuan et al. (2015),\nindicates that the mass flux of wind launched from hot accretion flow\n$\\dot{M}_{\\rm wind}=\\dot{M}_{\\rm BH}(r/20r_s)$, with $r\\la R_A\\equiv GM_{\\rm\nBH}/\\sigma^2$. Here $\\dot{M}_{\\rm BH}$ is accretion rate at black hole horizon.\n$R_A$ is similar to Bondi radius. We argue that the inward decrease of inflow\nrate is not because of mass loss via wind, but because of convective motion.\nThe disappearance of wind outside of $R_A$ must be because of the change of the\ngravitational potential, but the exact reason remains to be probed.\n", "  We use biquaternion to construct SL(2,C) ADHM Yang-Mills instantons. The\nsolutions contain 16k-6 moduli parameters for the kth homotopy class, and\ninclude as a subset the SL(2,C) (M,N) instanton solutions constructed\npreviously. In constrast to the SU(2) instantons, the SL(2,C) instantons\ninhereit jumping lines or singulariries which are not gauge artifacts and can\nnot be gauged away.\n", "  We employ the graviton self-energy induced by a massless, minimally coupled\n(MMC) scalar on de Sitter background to compute the quantum corrections to the\ngravitational potentials of a static point particle with a mass $M$. The\nSchwinger-Keldysh formalism is used to derive real and causal effective field\nequations. When evaluated at the one-loop order, the gravitational potentials\nexhibit a secular decrease in the observed gravitational coupling $G$. This can\nalso be interpreted as a (time dependent) anti-screening of the mass $M$.\n", "  The galaxy cluster RX J0603.3+4214 at z=0.225 is one of the rarest clusters\nboasting an extremely large (~2 Mpc) radio-relic. Because of the remarkable\nmorphology of the relic, the cluster is nicknamed \"Toothbrush Cluster\".\nAlthough the cluster's underlying mass distribution is one of the critical\npieces of information needed to reconstruct the merger scenario responsible for\nthe puzzling radio-relic morphology, its proximity to the Galactic plane b~10\ndeg has imposed significant observational challenges. We present a\nhigh-resolution weak-lensing study of the cluster with Subaru/Suprime Cam and\nHubble Space Telescope imaging data. Our mass reconstruction reveals that the\ncluster is comprised of complicated dark matter substructures closely tracing\nthe galaxy distribution, however in contrast with the relatively simple binary\nX-ray morphology. Nevertheless, we find that the cluster mass is still\ndominated by the two most massive clumps aligned north-south with a ~3:1 mass\nratio (M_{200}=6.29_{-1.62}^{+2.24} x 10^{14} Msun and 1.98_{-0.74}^{+1.24} x\n10^{14} Msun for the northern and southern clumps, respectively). The southern\nmass peak is ~2' offset toward the south with respect to the corresponding\nX-ray peak, which has a \"bullet\"-like morphology pointing south. Comparison of\nthe current weak-lensing result with the X-ray, galaxy, and radio-relic\nsuggests that perhaps the dominant mechanism responsible for the observed relic\nmay be a high-speed collision of the two most massive subclusters, although the\npeculiarity of the morphology necessitates involvement of additional\nsub-clusters. Careful numerical simulations should follow in order to obtain\nmore complete understanding of the merger scenario utilizing all existing\nobservations.\n", "  We consider an extension of the Starobinsky model, whose parameters are\nfunctions of an extra scalar field. Our motivation is to test the robustness\n(or sensitivity) of the Starobinsky inflation against mixing scalaron with\nanother (matter) scalar field. We find that the extended Starobinsky model is\n(classically) equivalent to the two-field inflation, with the scalar potential\nhaving a flat direction. For the sake of fully explicit calculations, we\nperform a numerical scan of the parameter space. Our numerical calculations\nsupport the viability of the Starobinsky-like two-field inflation for the\ncertain range of its parameters, which are characterized by the scalar index\n$n_s=0.96\\pm 0.01$, the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r<0.06$, and small running of\nthe scalar index at $|\\alpha_s|<0.05$.\n", "  We present an $R$-matrix Fortran package to solve coupled-channel problems in\nnuclear physics. The basis functions are chosen as Lagrange functions, which\npermits simple calculations of the matrix elements. The main input are the\ncoupling potentials at some nucleus-nucleus distances, specified by the\nprogram. The program provides the collision matrix and, optionally, the\nassociated wave function. The present method deals with open and closed\nchannels simultaneously, without numerical instability associated with closed\nchannels. It can also solve coupled-channel problems for non-local potentials.\nLong-range potentials can be treated with propagation techniques, which\nsignificantly speed up the calculations. We first present an overview of the\n$R$-matrix theory, and of the Lagrange-mesh method. A description of the\npackage and its installation on a UNIX machine is then provided. Finally, five\ntypical examples are discussed.\n", "  All-loop planar scattering amplitudes in maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills\ntheory can be formulated geometrically in terms of the \"amplituhedron\". We\nstudy the mathematical structures of the one-loop amplituhedron, and present a\nnew formula for its canonical measure, or the one-loop Grassmannian measure\nformula. Using the recently proposed momentum-twistor diagrams, we show that\nthere is a correspondence between the cells of one-loop amplituhedron, BCFW\nterms or equivalently on-shell diagrams, and residues of the one-loop\nGrassmannian formula. In particular, for the first non-trivial case of one-loop\nNMHV, these structures are naturally associated with a nice geometric picture\nas polygons in projective space, as we discuss in various illustrative\nexamples.\n", "  The entropy of generic non-extremal dyonic black holes in the STU model has\nbeen shown to admit a remarkably universal form. The missing invariant in the\nformula was recently identified by S\\'arosi using the formalism of quantum\nentanglement as well as a higher dimensional embedding of the U-duality group.\nHere, we express the non-extremal black hole entropy in the STU model in terms\nof U-duality covariant tensors. We then provide the extension to the most\ngeneral non-extremal black hole of ungauged $\\mathcal N= 8$ supergravity using\n$E_{7(7)}$ invariants. We also conjecture a generalization for ungauged\n$\\mathcal N = 2$ supergravity coupled to vector multiplets with arbitrary cubic\nprepotential. The most general rotating dyonic black hole solution of the STU\nmodel with all scalar moduli turned on is provided in an appendix.\n", "  Linear and nonlinear mechanisms for conical wave propagation in\ntwo-dimensional lattices are explored in the realm of phononic crystals. As a\nprototypical example, a statically compressed granular lattice of spherical\nparticles arranged in a hexagonal packing configuration is analyzed. Upon\nidentifying the dispersion relation of the underlying linear problem, the\nresulting diffraction properties are considered. Analysis both via a heuristic\nargument for the linear propagation of a wavepacket, as well as via asymptotic\nanalysis leading to the derivation of a Dirac system suggests the occurrence of\nconical diffraction. This analysis is valid for strong precompression i.e.,\nnear the linear regime. For weak precompression, conical wave propagation is\nstill possible, but the resulting expanding circular wave front is of a\nnon-oscillatory nature, resulting from the complex interplay between the\ndiscreteness, nonlinearity and geometry of the packing. The transition between\nthese two types of propagation is explored.\n", "  We apply Ferrara-Porrati-Sagnotti approach to the case of one-dimensional\nsupersymmetric model with N=2 supersymmetry spontaneously broken to the N=1\none. We explicitly demonstrate that only one superfield can be treated as the\nGoldstone one, while the second one has the meaning of the matter superfield.\nThe general action for such a system is constructed and also two relevant\nparticular cases are considered.\n", "  Observations of the 21 cm line radiation coming from the epoch of\nreionization have a great capacity to study the cosmological growth of the\nUniverse. Also, CMB polarization produced by gravitational lensing has a large\namount of information about the growth of matter fluctuations at late time. In\nthis paper, we investigate their sensitivities to the impact of neutrino\nproperty on the growth of density fluctuations, such as the total neutrino\nmass, the effective number of neutrino species (extra radiation), and the\nneutrino mass hierarchy. We will show that by combining a precise CMB\npolarization observations such as Simons Array with a 21 cm line observation\nsuch as Square kilometer Array (SKA) phase 1 and a baryon acoustic oscillation\nobservation (Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument:DESI) we can measure effects\nof non-zero neutrino mass on the growth of density fluctuation if the total\nneutrino mass is larger than 0.1eV. Additionally, the combinations can strongly\nimprove errors of the bounds on the effective number of neutrino species\nsigma(N_nu) ~ 0.06-0.09 at 95 % C.L.. Finally, by using SKA phase 2, we can\ndetermine the neutrino mass hierarchy at 95 % C.L. if the total neutrino mass\nis similar to or smaller than 0.1 eV.\n", "  We present high-resolution Large Binocular Telescope LBTI/LMIRcam images of\nthe spectroscopic and astrometric binary NO UMa obtained as part of the LBTI\nExozodi Exoplanet Common Hunt (LEECH) exoplanet imaging survey. Our H, K$_s$,\nand L'-band observations resolve the system at angular separations <0.09\". The\ncomponents exhibit significant orbital motion over a span of ~7 months. We\ncombine our imaging data with archival images, published speckle interferometry\nmeasurements, and existing spectroscopic velocity data to solve the full\norbital solution and estimate component masses. The masses of the K2.0$\\pm$0.5\nprimary and K6.5$\\pm$0.5 secondary are 0.83$\\pm$0.02 M$_{\\odot}$ and\n0.64$\\pm$0.02 M$_{\\odot}$, respectively. We also derive a system distance of d\n= 25.87$\\pm$0.02 pc and revise the Galactic kinematics of NO UMa. Our revised\nGalactic kinematics confirm NO UMa as a nuclear member of the ~500 Myr old Ursa\nMajor moving group and it is thus a mass and age benchmark. We compare the\nmasses of the NO UMa binary components to those predicted by five sets of\nstellar evolution models at the age of the Ursa Major group. We find excellent\nagreement between our measured masses and model predictions with little\nsystematic scatter between the models. NO UMa joins the short list of nearby,\nbright, late-type binaries having known ages and fully characterized orbits.\n", "  Calorimetric decay energy spectroscopy of electron-capture-decaying isotopes\nis a promising method to achieve the sensitivity required for electron neutrino\nmass measurement. The very low total nuclear decay energy (QEC < 3 keV) and\nshort half-life (4570 y) of 163Ho make it attractive for high-precision\nelectron capture spectroscopy (ECS) near the kinematic endpoint, where the\nneutrino momentum goes to zero. In the ECS approach, an\nelectron-capture-decaying isotope is embedded inside a microcalorimeter\ndesigned to capture and measure the energy of all the decay radiation except\nthat of the escaping neutrino. We have developed a complete process for\nproton-irradiation-based isotope production, isolation, and purification of\n163Ho. We have developed transition-edge sensors for this measurement and\nmethods for incorporating 163Ho into high-resolution microcalorimeters, and\nhave measured the electron-capture spectrum of 163Ho. We present our work in\nthese areas and discuss the measured spectrum and its comparison to current\ntheory.\n", "  In this work we propose a Hybrid method with Deviational Particles (HDP) for\na plasma modeled by the inhomogeneous Vlasov-Poisson-Landau system. We split\nthe distribution into a Maxwellian part evolved by a grid based fluid solver\nand a deviation part simulated by numerical particles. These particles, named\ndeviational particles, could be both positive and negative. We combine the\nMonte Carlo method proposed in \\cite{YC15}, a Particle in Cell method and a\nMacro-Micro decomposition method \\cite{BLM08} to design an efficient hybrid\nmethod. Furthermore, coarse particles are employed to accelerate the\nsimulation. A particle resampling technique on both deviational particles and\ncoarse particles is also investigated and improved. The efficiency is\nsignificantly improved compared to a PIC-MCC method, especially near the fluid\nregime.\n", "  The radiation pressure of light can act to damp and cool the vibrational\nmotion of a mechanical resonator. In understanding the quantum limits of this\ncooling, one must consider the effect of shot noise fluctuations on the final\nthermal occupation. In optomechanical sideband cooling in a cavity, the finite\nStokes Raman scattering defined by the cavity linewidth combined with shot\nnoise fluctuations dictates a quantum backaction limit, analogous to the\nDoppler limit of atomic laser cooling. In our work we sideband cool to the\nquantum backaction limit by using a micromechanical membrane precooled in a\ndilution refrigerator. Monitoring the optical sidebands allows us to directly\nobserve the mechanical object come to thermal equilibrium with the optical\nbath.\n", "  The principles of noncommutative geometry impose severe restrictions on the\nstructure of (almost) commutative field theories. The Standard Model fits\nsurprisingly well into the noncommutative framework. Here we overview some\nuniversal predictions of the spectral action principle for the behavior of\nbosonic theories at very high energies.\n", "  We characterize niobium-based lateral Superconductor (S) - Normal metal (N) -\nSuperconductor weak links through low-temperature switching current\nmeasurements and tunnel spectroscopy. We fabricate the SNS devices in two\nseparate lithography and deposition steps, combined with strong argon ion\ncleaning before the normal metal deposition in the last step. Our SNS weak link\nconsists of high-quality sputtered Nb electrodes that are contacted with\nevaporated Cu. The two-step fabrication flow enables great flexibility in the\nchoice of materials and pattern design. A comparison of the\ntemperature-dependent equilibrium critical supercurrent with theoretical\npredictions indicates that the quality of the Nb-Cu interface is similar to\nthat of evaporated Al-Cu weak links. Aiming at increased sensitivity, range of\noperation temperatures, and thermal isolation, we investigate how these SNS\nstructures can be combined with shadow-evaporated aluminum tunnel junctions for\nsensor applications that utilize the superconducting proximity effect. To this\nend, we demonstrate a hybrid magnetic flux sensor based on a Nb-Cu-Nb SNS\njunction, where the phase-dependent normal metal density of states is probed\nwith an Al tunnel junction.\n", "  We consider networks made of parallel lanes along which particles hop\naccording to driven diffusive dynamics. The particles also hop transversely\nfrom lane to lane, hence indirectly coupling their longitudinal dynamics. We\npresent a general method for constructing the phase diagram of these systems\nwhich reveals that in many cases their physics reduce to that of single-lane\nsystems. The reduction to an effective single-lane description legitimizes, for\ninstance, the use of a single TASEP to model the hopping of molecular motors\nalong the many tracks of a single microtubule. Then, we show how, in quasi-2D\nsettings, new phenomena emerge due to the presence of non-zero transverse\ncurrents, leading, for instance, to strong `shear localisation' along the\nnetwork.\n", "  We examine a model of reduced staggered fermions in three dimensions\ninteracting through an $SO(4)$ invariant four fermion interaction. The model is\nsimilar to that considered in a recent paper by Ayyer and Chandrasekharan\n\\cite{Ayyar:2014eua}. We present theoretical arguments and numerical evidence\nwhich support the idea that the system develops a mass gap for sufficiently\nstrong four fermi coupling.{\\it without} producing a symmetry breaking fermion\nbilinear condensate. Massless and massive phases appear to be separated by a\ncontinuous phase transition.\n", "  The aim of this work is to investigate and characterise particle behaviour in\nan (observationally-driven) 3D MHD model of the solar atmosphere above a slowly\nevolving, non-flaring active region. We use a relativistic guiding-centre\nparticle code to investigate the behaviour of selected particle orbits,\ndistributed throughout a single snapshot of the 3D MHD simulation. Two distinct\nparticle acceleration behaviours are recovered, which affect both electrons and\nprotons: (i) direct acceleration along field lines and (ii) tangential drifting\nof guiding centres with respect to local magnetic field. However, up to 40\\% of\nall particles actually experience a form of (high energy) particle trap,\nbecause of changes in the direction of the electric field and unrelated to the\nstrength of the magnetic field; such particles are included in the first\ncategory. Additionally, category (i) electron and proton orbits undergo\nsurprisingly strong acceleration to non-thermal energies ($\\lesssim42$MeV),\nbecause of the strength and extent of super-Dreicer electric fields created by\nthe MHD simulation. Reducing the electric field strength of the MHD model does\nnot significantly affect the efficiency of the (electric field-based) trapping\nmechanism, but does reduce the peak energies gained by orbits. We discuss the\nimplications for future experiments, which aim to simulate non-flaring active\nregion heating and reconnection.\n", "  I present a determination of longitudinally-polarized parton distribution\nfunctions of the proton from inclusive deep-inelastic scattering data:\nNNPDFpol1.0+. This determination, based on the NNPDF methodology, upgrades a\nprevious analysis, NNPDFpol1.0, in two respects: first, it includes all new\ndata sets which have recently become available from the COMPASS experiment at\nCERN and from the E93-009, EG1-DVCS and E06-014 experiments at JLAB; second, it\nuses the state-of-the-art unpolarized parton set NNPDF3.0 as a baseline for the\nreconstruction of fitted observables and for the determination of positivity\nconstraints. I discuss the impact of both these new inputs on the uncertainty\nof parton distribution functions.\n", "  We present a study of the recently discovered compact stellar system\nTriangulum II. From observations conducted with the DEIMOS spectrograph on Keck\nII, we obtained spectra for 13 member stars that follow the CMD features of\nthis very faint stellar system and include two bright red giant branch stars.\nTri II has a very negative radial velocity (<v_r>=-383.7^{+3.0}_{-3.3} km/s)\nthat translates to <v_{r,gsr}> ~ -264 km/s and confirms it is a Milky Way\nsatellite. We show that, despite the small data set, there is evidence that Tri\nII has complex internal kinematics. Its radial velocity dispersion increases\nfrom 4.4^{+2.8}_{-2.0} km/s in the central 2' to 14.1^{+5.8}_{-4.2} km/s\noutwards. The velocity dispersion of the full sample is inferred to be\n\\sigma_{vr}=9.9^{+3.2}_{-2.2} km/s. From the two bright RGB member stars we\nmeasure an average metallicity <[Fe/H]>=-2.6+/-0.2, placing Tri II among the\nmost metal-poor Milky Way dwarf galaxies. In addition, the spectra of the\nfainter member stars exhibit differences in their line widths that could be the\nindication of a metallicity dispersion in the system. All these properties\npaint a complex picture for Tri II, whose nature and current state are largely\nspeculative. The inferred metallicity properties of the system however lead us\nto favor a scenario in which Tri II is a dwarf galaxy that is either disrupting\nor embedded in a stellar stream.\n", "  Temperature evolution of the spin correlation and excitation spectrum is\ninvestigated for a Kitaev model defined on a decorated honeycomb lattice by\nusing the quantum Monte Carlo simulation in the Majorana fermion\nrepresentation. The ground state of this quantum spin model is given by two\nkinds of chiral spin liquids: one is topologically trivial with Abelian anyon\nexcitations, and the other is topologically nontrivial with non-Abelian anyon\nexcitations. While lowering temperature, the model exhibits several crossovers\nin the paramagnetic state, which originate from the fractionalization of\nquantum spins into Majorana fermions, in addition to a phase transition\nassociated with time reversal symmetry breaking. We show that the spin\ncorrelation develops around the crossover temperatures, whereas it shows a\nslight change at the critical temperature, as in other Kitaev-type models. We\nalso calculate the excitation spectrum in terms of Majorana fermions, and find\nthat the excitation gap in the non-Abelian phase is fragile against thermal\nfluctuations of the $Z_2$ fluxes, while that in the Abelian phase remains open.\n", "  Based on the factorization representation of the General Parton Distributions\n(GPDs) the momentum transfer dependence was determined by the analysis of the\ndifferent representations of parton distribution functions (PDFs) and all\npossible experimental data of the electromagnetic form factors of the proton\nand neutron. The obtained $t$-dependence of the GPDs is checked by analysis of\nthe different hadronic reactions (including exclusive and elastic hadron\nscattering) in a wide energy region with minimum free fitting parameters.\n", "  We use quantum optimal control theory algorithms to design external electric\nfields that drive the coupled spin and orbital dynamics of an electron in a\ndouble quantum dot, subject to the spin-orbit interaction and Zeeman magnetic\nfields. We obtain time-profiles of multi-frequency electric pulses which\nincrease the rate of spin-flip transitions by several orders of magnitude in\ncomparison with monochromatic fields, where the spin Rabi oscillations were\npredicted to be very slow. This precise, with the accuracy higher than\n$10^{-4}$, and fast, at the timescale of the order of 0.1 ns, simultaneous\ncontrol of the electron spin orientation and position is achieved while keeping\nthe electron in the four lowest tunneling- and Zeeman-split levels through the\nduration of the pulse, facilitating high fidelity and suggesting useful\napplications in spintronics and quantum information devices.\n", "  We recall that the full susceptibility series of the Ising model, modulo\npowers of the prime 2, reduce to algebraic functions. We also recall the\nnon-linear polynomial differential equation obtained by Tutte for the\ngenerating function of the q-coloured rooted triangulations by vertices, which\nis known to have algebraic solutions for all the numbers of the form $2 +2\n\\cos(j\\pi/n)$, the holonomic status of the q= 4 being unclear. We focus on the\nanalysis of the q= 4 case, showing that the corresponding series is quite\ncertainly non-holonomic. Along the line of a previous work on the\nsusceptibility of the Ising model, we consider this q=4 series modulo the first\neight primes 2, 3, ... 19, and show that this (probably non-holonomic) function\nreduces, modulo these primes, to algebraic functions. We conjecture that this\nprobably non-holonomic function reduces to algebraic functions modulo (almost)\nevery prime, or power of prime numbers. This raises the question to see whether\nsuch remarkable non-holonomic functions can be seen as ratio of diagonals of\nrational functions, or algebraic, functions of diagonals of rational functions.\n", "  We consider a class of flavored dark matter (DM) theories where dark matter\ninteracts with the Standard Model lepton fields at the renormalizable level. We\nallow for a general coupling matrix between the dark matter and leptons whose\nstructure is beyond the one permitted by the minimal flavor violation (MFV)\nassumption. It is assumed that this is the only new source of flavor violation\nin addition to the Standard Model (SM) Yukawa interactions. The setup can be\ndescribed by augmenting the SM flavor symmetry by an additional\n$\\mathrm{SU}(3)_{\\chi}$, under which the dark matter $\\chi$ transforms. This\nframework is especially phenomenologically rich, due to possible novel\nflavor-changing interactions which are not present within the more restrictive\nMFV framework. As a representative case study of this setting, which we call\n\"beyond MFV\" (BMFV), we consider Dirac fermion dark matter which transforms as\na singlet under the SM gauge group and a triplet under $\\mathrm{SU}(3)_{\\chi}$.\nThe DM fermion couples to the SM lepton sector through a scalar mediator\n$\\phi$. Unlike the case of quark-flavored DM, we show that there is no\n$\\mathbb{Z}_3$ symmetry within either the MFV or BMFV settings which\nautomatically stabilizes the lepton-flavored DM. We discuss constraints on this\nsetup from flavor-changing processes, DM relic abundance as well as direct and\nindirect detections. We find that relatively large flavor-changing couplings\nare possible, while the dark matter mass is still within the phenomenologically\ninteresting region below the TeV scale. Collider signatures which can be\npotentially searched for at the lepton and hadron colliders are discussed.\nFinally, we discuss the implications for decaying dark matter, which can appear\nif an additional stabilizing symmetry is not imposed.\n", "  Motivated by nucleation and molecular aggregation in physical, chemical and\nbiological settings, we present an extension to a thorough analysis of the\nstochastic self-assembly of a fixed number of identical particles in a finite\nvolume. We study the statistic of times it requires for maximal clusters to be\ncompleted, starting from a pure-monomeric particle configuration. For finite\nvolume, we extend previous analytical approaches to the case of arbitrary\nsize-dependent aggregation and fragmentation kinetic rates. For larger volume,\nwe develop a scaling framework to study the behavior of the first assembly time\nas a function of the total quantity of particles.\n  We find that the mean time to first completion of a maximum-sized cluster may\nhave surprisingly a very weak dependency on the total number of particles. We\nhighlight how the higher statistic (variance, distribution) of the first\npassage time may still help to infer key parameters (such as the size of the\nmaximum cluster) from data. And last but not least, we present a framework to\nquantify the formation of cluster of macroscopic size, whose formation is\n(asymptotically) very unlikely and occurs as a large deviation phenomenon from\nthe mean-field limit. We argue that this framework is suitable to describe\nphase transition phenomena, as inherent infrequent stochastic processes, in\ncontrast to classical nucleation theory.\n", "  We study intersite electron correlations in the half-filled Hubbard model on\nsquare lattices with periodic and open boundary conditions by means of a\nreal-space dual fermion approach. By calculating renormalization factors, we\nclarify that nearest-neighbor intersite correlations already significantly\nreduce the critical interaction. The Mott transition occurs at U/t~6.4, where\n$U$ is the interaction strength and t is the hopping integral. This value is\nconsistent with the quantum Monte Carlo results. This shows the importance of\nshort-range intersite correlations, which are taken into account in the\nframework of the real-space dual fermion approach.\n", "  As dipolar gases become more readily accessible in experiment there is a need\nto develop a comprehensive theoretical framework of the few-body physics of\nthese systems. Here, we extend the coupled-pair approach developed for the\nunitary two-component Fermi gas to a few-body system of dipolar bosons in a\nspherical harmonic trap. The long range and anisotropy of the dipole-dipole\ninteraction is handled by a flexible and efficient correlated gaussian basis\nwith stochastically variational optimisation. We calculate the eigenenergy\nspectrum and structural properties of two and three trapped bosonic dipoles.\nThis demonstrates the efficiency and flexibility of the coupled-pair approach\nat dealing with systems with complex interactions.\n", "  We study valence fluctuations at finite temperatures in the extended periodic\nAnderson model, where the Coulomb interaction between conduction and localized\n$f$-electrons is taken into account, using dynamical mean-field theory combined\nwith the continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo (CT-QMC) method. The valence\ntransition with the hysteresis is clearly found, indicating the first-order\nphase transition between the Kondo and mixed-valence states. We demonstrate\nthat spin correlation rapidly develops when the system approaches the valence\ntransition point. The comparison of the impurity solvers, %: the CT-QMC,\nnon-crossing approximation, and one-crossing approximation, is also addressed.\n", "  Quantum Hall (QH) systems consist of many-body electron and nuclear spins.\nThey are coupled so weakly through the hyperfine interaction that normally\nelectron spin dynamics are scarcely affected by the nuclear spins. The dynamics\nof the QH systems, however, may drastically change when the nuclear spins\ninteract with low-energy collective excitation modes of the electron spins. We\ntheoretically investigate the nuclear-electron spin interaction in the QH\nsystems as hybrid quantum systems driven by the hyperfine interaction. In\nparticular, we study the interaction between the nuclear spins and the\nNambu-Goldstone (NG) mode with the linear dispersion relation associated with\nthe U(1) spin rotational symmetry breaking. We show that such an interaction is\ndescribed as nuclear spins collectively coupled to the NG mode, and can be\neffectively described by the Dicke model. Based on the model we suggest that\nvarious collective spin phenomena realized in quantum optical systems also\nemerge in the QH systems.\n", "  We use Monte Carlo methods to explore the set of toric threefold bases that\nsupport elliptic Calabi-Yau fourfolds for F-theory compactifications to four\ndimensions, and study the distribution of geometrically non-Higgsable gauge\ngroups, matter, and quiver structure. We estimate the number of distinct\nthreefold bases in the connected set studied to be $\\sim { 10^{48}}$. The\ndistribution of bases peaks around $h^{1, 1}\\sim 82$. All bases encountered\nafter \"thermalization\" have some geometric non-Higgsable structure. We find\nthat the number of non-Higgsable gauge group factors grows roughly linearly in\n$h^{1,1}$ of the threefold base. Typical bases have $\\sim 6$ isolated gauge\nfactors as well as several larger connected clusters of gauge factors with\njointly charged matter. Approximately 76% of the bases sampled contain\nconnected two-factor gauge group products of the form SU(3)$\\times$SU(2), which\nmay act as the non-Abelian part of the standard model gauge group.\nSU(3)$\\times$SU(2) is the third most common connected two-factor product group,\nfollowing SU(2)$\\times$SU(2) and $G_2\\times$SU(2), which arise more frequently.\n", "  Based on the known non-linear transformation rules of the Weyl multiplet\nfields, the action of $N=4$ conformal supergravity is constructed up to terms\nquadratic in the fermion fields. The bosonic sector corrects a recent result in\nthe literature.\n", "  We show that artificial magnetism of periodic dielectric or metal/dielectric\nstructures has limitations and is subject to at least two \"uncertainty\nprinciples\". First, the stronger the magnetic response (the deviation of the\neffective permeability tensor from identity), the less accurate (\"certain\") the\npredictions of any homogeneous model. Second, if the magnetic response is\nstrong, then homogenization cannot accurately reproduce the transmission and\nreflection parameters and, simultaneously, power dissipation in the material.\nThese principles are general and not confined to any particular method of\nhomogenization. Our theoretical analysis is supplemented with a numerical\nexample: a hexahedral lattice of cylindrical air holes in a dielectric host.\nEven though this case is highly isotropic, which might be thought as conducive\nto homogenization, the uncertainty principles remain valid.\n", "  Type I X-ray bursts are thermonuclear flashes observed from the surfaces of\naccreting neutron stars (NSs) in Low Mass X-ray Binaries. Oscillations have\nbeen observed during the rise and/or decay of some of these X-ray bursts. Those\nseen during the rise can be well explained by a spreading hot spot model, but\nlarge amplitude oscillations in the decay phase remain mysterious because of\nthe absence of a clear-cut source of asymmetry. To date there have not been any\nquantitative studies that consistently track the oscillation amplitude both\nduring the rise and decay (cooling tail) of bursts. Here we compute the light\ncurves and amplitudes of oscillations in X-ray burst models that realistically\naccount for both flame spreading and subsequent cooling. We present results for\nseveral such \"cooling wake\" models, a \"canonical\" cooling model where each\npatch on the NS surface heats and cools identically, or with a\nlatitude-dependent cooling timescale set by the local effective gravity, and an\n\"asymmetric\" model where parts of the star cool at significantly different\nrates. We show that while the canonical cooling models can generate\noscillations in the tails of bursts, they cannot easily produce the highest\nobserved modulation amplitudes. Alternatively, a simple phenomenological model\nwith asymmetric cooling can achieve higher amplitudes consistent with the\nobservations.\n", "  We experimentally study the statistical properties of the energy fluxes\nbetween two trapped Brownian particles, interacting through dissipative\nhydrodynamic coupling, submitted to an effective temperature difference $\\Delta\nT$, obtained by random forcing the position of one trap. We identify effective\nheat fluxes between the two particles and show that they satisfy an exchange\nfluctuation theorem (xFT) in the stationary state. We also show that after the\nsudden application of a temperature gradient $\\Delta T$, \\resub{the total}\nhot-cold flux satisfies \\resub{a} transient xFT for any integration time\nwhereas \\resub{the total} cold-hot flux only does it asymptotically for long\ntimes.\n", "  We present a path integral formalism to compute potentials for nonequilibrium\nsteady states, reached by a multiplicative stochastic dynamics. We develop a\nweak-noise expansion, which allows the explicit evaluation of the potential in\narbitrary dimensions and for any stochastic prescription. We apply this general\nformalism to study noise-induced phase transitions. We focus on a class of\nmultiplicative stochastic lattice models and compute the steady state phase\ndiagram in terms of the noise intensity and the lattice coupling. We obtain,\nunder appropriate conditions, an ordered phase induced by noise. By computing\nentropy production, we show that microscopic irreversibility is a necessary\ncondition to develop noise-induced phase transitions. This property of the\nnonequilibrium stationary state has no relation with the initial stages of the\ndynamical evolution, in contrast with previous interpretations, based on the\nshort-time evolution of the order parameter.\n", "  In the last decade, spectral linear statistics on large dimensional random\nmatrices have attracted significant attention. Within the physics community, a\nprivileged role has been played by invariant matrix ensembles for which a two\ndimensional Coulomb gas analogy is available. We present a critical revision of\nthe Coulomb gas method in Random Matrix Theory (RMT) borrowing language and\ntools from Large Deviations Theory. This allows us to formalize an equivalent,\nbut more effective and quicker route toward RMT free energy calculations.\nMoreover, we argue that this more modern viewpoint is likely to shed further\nlight on the interesting issues of weak phase transitions and evaporation\nphenomena recently observed in RMT.\n", "  We report on the spectroscopic investigation of quantum dot - micropillar\ncavities with unprecedented quality factors. We observe a pronounced dependency\nof the quality factor on the measurement scheme, and find that significantly\nlarger quality factors can be extracted in photoreflectance compared to\nphotoluminescence measurements. While the photoluminescence spectra of the\nmicrocavity resonances feature a Lorentzian lineshape and Q-factors up to\n184,000, the reflectance spectra have a Fano-shaped asymmetry and feature\nsignificantly higher Q-factors in excess of 250,000 resulting from a full\nsaturation of the embedded emitters. The very high quality factors in our\ncavities promote strong light-matter coupling with visibilities exceeding 0.5\nfor a single QD coupled to the cavity mode.\n", "  In this article, we review recent theoretical works on the Schwingermechanism\nof particle production in external electrical fields. Although the\nnon-perturbative Schwinger mechanism is at the center of this discussion, many\nof the approaches that we discuss can cope with general time and space\ndependent fields, and therefore also capture the perturbative contributions to\nparticle production.\n", "  The strong deformation splitting of the isoscalar giant monopole resonance\n(ISGMR), recently observed in ($\\alpha,\\alpha'$) reaction in prolate $^{24}$Mg,\nis analyzed in the framework of the Skyrme quasiparticle\nrandom-phase-approximation (QRPA) approach with the Skyrme forces SkM*, SVbas\nand SkP$^{\\delta}$. The calculations with these forces give close results and\nconfirm that the low-energy E0-peak is caused by the deformation-induced\ncoupling of ISGMR with the K=0 branch of the isoscalar giant quadrupole\nresonance.\n", "  Despite the success statistical physics has enjoyed at predicting the\nproperties of materials for given parameters, the inverse problem, identifying\nwhich material parameters produce given, desired properties, is only beginning\nto be addressed. Recently, several methods have emerged across disciplines that\ndraw upon optimization and simulation to create computer programs that tailor\nmaterial responses to specified behaviors. However, so far the methods\ndeveloped either involve black-box techniques, in which the optimizer operates\nwithout explicit knowledge of the material's configuration space, or they\nrequire carefully tuned algorithms with applicability limited to a narrow\nsubclass of materials. Here we introduce a formalism that can generate\noptimizers automatically by extending statistical mechanics into the realm of\ndesign. The strength of this new approach lies in its capability to transform\nstatistical models that describe materials into optimizers to tailor them. By\ncomparing against standard black-box optimization methods, we demonstrate how\noptimizers generated by this formalism can be faster and more effective, while\nremaining straightforward to implement. The scope of our approach includes new\npossibilities for solving a variety of complex optimization and design problems\nconcerning materials both in and out of equilibrium.\n", "  The electron component of an ultracold neutral plasma (UCP) is modeled based\non a scalable method using a self-consistently determined mean-field\napproximation. Representative sampling of discrete electrons within the UCP are\nused to project the electron spatial distribution onto an expansion of\northogonal basis functions. A collision operator acting on the sample electrons\nis employed in order to drive the distribution toward thermal equilibrium.\nThese equilibrium distributions can be determined for non-zero electron\ntemperatures even in the presence of spherical symmetry-breaking applied\nelectric fields. This is useful for predicting key macroscopic UCP parameters,\nsuch as the depth of the electrons' confining potential. Dynamics such as\nelectron oscillations in UCPs with non-uniform density distributions can also\nbe treated by this model.\n", "  The HERMES spectrograph installed on the 1.2-m Mercator telescope has been\nused to monitor the radial velocity of 13 low-metallicity carbon stars, among\nwhich 7 Carbon-Enhanced Metal-Poor (CEMP) stars and 6 CH stars. All stars but\none show clear evidence for binarity. New orbits are obtained for 8 systems.\nThe sample covers an extended range in orbital periods, extending from 3.4 d\n(for the dwarf carbon star HE 0024-2523) to about 54 yr (for the CH star HD 26,\nthe longest known among barium, CH and extrinsic S stars). Three systems\nexhibit low-amplitude velocity variations with periods close to 1 yr\nsuperimposed on a long-term trend. In the absence of an accurate photometric\nmonitoring of these systems, it is not clear yet whether these variations are\nthe signature of a very low-mass companion, or of regular envelope pulsations.\nThe period - eccentricity (P - e) diagram for the 40 low-metallicity carbon\nstars with orbits now available shows no difference between CH and CEMP-s stars\n(the latter corresponding to those CEMP stars enriched in s-process elements,\nas are CH stars). We suggest that they must be considered as one and the same\nfamily and that their different names only stem from historical reasons.\nIndeed, these two families have as well very similar mass-function\ndistributions, corresponding to companions with masses in the range 0.5 - 0.7\nMsun, indicative of white-dwarf companions, adopting 0.8 - 0.9 Msun for the\nprimary component. This result confirms that CH and CEMP-s stars obey the same\nmass-transfer scenario as their higher-metallicity analogs, the barium stars.\nThe P - e diagrams of barium, CH and CEMP-s stars are indeed very similar. They\nreveal two different groups of systems: one with short orbital periods (P <\n1000 d) and mostly circular or almost circular orbits, and another with\nlonger-period and eccentric (e > 0.1) orbits.\n", "  Using many-body configuration interaction techniques we show that Wigner\ncrystallization occurs at the zigzag edges of graphene at surprisingly high\nelectronic densities up to $0.8$ $\\mbox{nm}^{-1}$. In contrast with\none-dimensional electron gas, the flat-band structure of the edge states makes\nthe system interaction dominated, facilitating the electronic localization. The\nresulting Wigner crystal manifests itself in pair-correlation functions, and\nevolves smoothly as the edge electron density is lowered. We also show that the\ncrystallization affects the magnetization of the edges. While the edges are\nfully polarized when the system is charge neutral (i.e. high density), above\nthe critical density, the spin-spin correlations between neighboring electrons\ngo through a smooth transition from antiferromagnetic to magnetic coupling as\nthe electronic density is lowered.\n", "  In this work, we study the Mazur and Mottola gravastar model within the\ncontext of Randall-Sundrum II type braneworld scenario, based on the fact that\nour four dimensional space-time is a three-brane, embedded in a five\ndimensional bulk. We present exact solutions of the modified field equations in\neach of the three regions making up the gravastar, namely, (I) the core, (II)\nthe shell, and (III) the vacuum exterior. The junction conditions at each\ninterface are fulfilled and we further explore interesting physical properties\nsuch as length and energy and entropy of the spherical distribution.\n", "  A radial-velocity monitoring of the Carbon-Enhanced Metal-Poor (CEMP) star HE\n0017+0055 over 8 years with the Nordic Optical Telescope and Mercator\ntelescopes reveals variability with a period of 384 d and amplitude of\n540$\\pm27$ m s$^{-1}$, superimposed on a nearly linear long-term decline of\n$\\sim$1 m s$^{-1}$ day$^{-1}$. High-resolution HERMES/Mercator and Keck/HIRES\nspectra have been used to derive elemental abundances using 1-D LTE MARCS\nmodels. A metallicity of [Fe/H] $\\sim -2.4$ is found, along with s-process\noverabundances on the order of 2 dex (with the exception of [Y/Fe] $\\sim+0.5$),\nand most notably overabundances of r-process elements like Sm, Eu, Dy, and Er\nin the range 0.9 - 2.0 dex. With [Ba/Fe] $ > 1.9$ dex and [Eu/Fe] = 2.3 dex, HE\n0017+0055 is a CEMP-rs star. It appears to be a giant star below the tip of the\nred giant branch (RGB). The s-process pollution must therefore originate from\nmass transfer from a companion formerly on the AGB, now a carbon-oxygen white\ndwarf (WD). If the 384 d velocity variations are attributed to the WD\ncompanion, its orbit must be seen almost face-on, with $i \\sim 2.3^\\circ$,\nbecause the mass function is very small: $f(M_1,M_2) =\n(6.1\\pm1.1)\\times10^{-6}$ Msun. Alternatively, the WD orbital motion could be\nresponsible for the long-term velocity variations, with a period of several\ndecades. The 384 d variations should then be attributed either to a low-mass\ninner companion (perhaps a brown dwarf, depending on the orbital inclination),\nor to stellar pulsations. The latter possibility is made likely by the fact\nthat similar low-amplitude velocity variations, with periods close to 1 yr,\nhave been reported for other CEMP stars in a companion paper (Jorissen et al.,\n2015). A definite conclusion about the origin of the 384 d velocity variations\nshould however await the detection of synchronous low-amplitude photometric\nvariations.\n", "  The Twin Higgs model seeks to address the little hierarchy problem by making\nthe Higgs a pseudo-Goldstone of a global $SU(4)$ symmetry that is spontaneously\nbroken to $SU(3)$. Gauge and Yukawa couplings, which explicitly break $SU(4)$,\nenjoy a discrete $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry that accidentally maintains $SU(4)$ at\nthe quadratic level and therefore keeps the Higgs light. Contrary to most\nbeyond the Standard Model theories, the quadratically divergent corrections to\nthe Higgs mass are cancelled by a mirror sector, which is uncharged under the\nStandard Model groups. However, the Twin Higgs with an exact $\\mathbb{Z}_2$\nsymmetry leads to equal vevs in the Standard Model and mirror sectors, which is\nphenomenologically unviable. An explicit $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ breaking potential must\nthen be introduced and tuned against the $SU(4)$ breaking terms to produce a\nhierarchy of vevs between the two sectors. This leads to a moderate but\nnon-negligible tuning. We propose a model to alleviate this tuning, without the\nneed for an explicit $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ breaking sector. The model consists of two\n$SU(4)$ fundamental Higgses, one whose vacuum preserves $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ and one\nwhose vacuum breaks it. As the interactions between the two Higgses are turned\non, the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ breaking is transmitted from the broken to the unbroken\nsector and a small hierarchy of vevs is naturally produced. The presence of an\neffective tadpole and feedback between the two Higgses lead to a sizable\nimprovement of the tuning. The resulting Higgs boson is naturally very Standard\nModel like.\n", "  A Quark-Nova (QN, the sudden transition from a neutron star into a quark\nstar) which occurs in the second common envelope (CE) phase of a massive binary\n(Ouyed et al., 2015a&b), gives excellent fits to super-luminous, hydrogen-poor,\nSupernovae (SLSNe) with double-peaked light curves including DES13S2cmm, SN\n2006oz and LSQ14bdq (http://www.quarknova.ca/LCGallery.html). In our model, the\nH envelope of the less massive companion is ejected during the first CE phase\nwhile the QN occurs deep inside the second, He-rich, CE phase after the CE has\nexpanded in size to a radius of a few tens to a few thousands solar radii, this\nyields the first peak in our model. The ensuing merging of the quark star with\nthe CO core leads to black hole formation and accretion explaining the second\nlong-lasting peak. We study a sample of 8 SLSNe Ic with double-humped\nlight-curves. Our model provides good fits to all of these with a universal\nexplosive energy of 2x10^52 erg (which is the kinetic energy of the QN ejecta)\nfor the first hump. The late-time emissions seen in iPTF13ehe and LSQ14bdq are\nfit with a shock interaction between the outgoing He-rich (i.e second) CE and\nthe previously ejected H-rich (i.e first) CE.\n", "  X-ray emission from Young Stellar Objects (YSOs) is crucial to understand\nstar formation. A very limited amount of X-ray results is available for the\nprotostellar (ClassI) phase. A systematic search of transient X-ray phenomena\ncombined with a careful evaluation of the evolutionary stage offer a widely\nunexplored window to our understanding of YSOs X-ray properties. Within the\nEXTraS project, a search for transients and variability in the whole XMM-Newton\narchive, we discover transient X-ray emission consistent with ISO-Oph 85, a\nstrongly embedded YSO in the rho Ophiuchi region, not detected in previous\ntime-averaged X-ray studies. We extract an X-ray light curve for the flare and\ndetermine its spectral parameters from XMM-Newton/EPIC (European Photon Imaging\nCamera) data using quantile analysis. The X-ray flare ($2500\\,s$), the only one\ndetected in the XMM-Newton archive for ISO-Oph 85, has a luminosity of\n$LogL_X[erg/s]=31.1$ and a spectrum consistent with a highly-absorbed\none-component thermal model ($N_H=1.0^{+1.2}_{-0.5}10^{23}\\,cm^{-2}$,\n$kT=1.15^{+2.35}_{-0.65}\\,keV)$. We set an upper limit of $LogL_X[erg/s]<29.5$\nto the quiescent X-ray luminosity. We build a SED with IR to mm photometry\ndrawn from literature and mid-IR Spitzer and sub-mm Herschel photometry\nanalysed by us, and compare it with pre-computed models. The sub-mm emission\npeak in the Herschel data suggests that the object is a ClassI protostar.\nHowever, the Herschel/IR position offset is larger than for other YSOs in the\nregion, leaving some doubt on the association. This is the first X-ray flare\nfrom a YSO recognised as a candidate ClassI YSO via the analysis of its\ncomplete SED. This work shows how the analysis of the whole SED is fundamental\nfor the classification of YSOs, and how the X-ray source detection techniques\nwe developed can open a new era in time-resolved analysis of the X-ray emission\nfrom stars.\n", "  Neutron star mergers are among the most promising sources of gravitational\nwaves for advanced ground-based detectors. These mergers are also expected to\npower bright electromagnetic signals, in the form of short gamma-ray bursts,\ninfrared/optical transients, and radio emission. Simulations of these mergers\nwith fully general relativistic codes are critical to understand the merger and\npost-merger gravitational wave signals and their neutrinos and electromagnetic\ncounterparts. In this paper, we employ the SpEC code to simulate the merger of\nlow-mass neutron star binaries (two $1.2M_\\odot$ neutron stars) for a set of\nthree nuclear-theory based, finite temperature equations of state. We show that\nthe frequency peaks of the post-merger gravitational wave signal are in good\nagreement with predictions obtained from simulations using a simpler treatment\nof gravity. We find, however, that only the fundamental mode of the remnant is\nexcited for long periods of time: emission at the secondary peaks is damped on\na millisecond timescale in the simulated binaries. For such low-mass systems,\nthe remnant is a massive neutron star which, depending on the equation of\nstate, is either permanently stable or long-lived. We observe strong\nexcitations of l=2, m=2 modes, both in the massive neutron star and in the form\nof hot, shocked tidal arms in the surrounding accretion torus. We estimate the\nneutrino emission of the remnant using a neutrino leakage scheme and, in one\ncase, compare these results with a gray two-moment neutrino transport scheme.\nWe confirm the complex geometry of the neutrino emission, also observed in\nprevious simulations with neutrino leakage, and show explicitly the presence of\nimportant differences in the neutrino luminosity, disk composition, and outflow\nproperties between the neutrino leakage and transport schemes.\n", "  Most successful galaxy formation scenarios now postulate that the intense\nstar formation in massive, high-redshift galaxies during their major growth\nperiod was truncated when powerful AGNs launched galaxy-wide outflows of gas\nthat removed large parts of the interstellar medium. The most powerful radio\ngalaxies at z~2 show clear signatures of such winds, but are too rare to be\ngood representatives of a generic phase in the evolution of all massive\ngalaxies at high redshift. Here we present SINFONI imaging spectroscopy of 12\nradio galaxies at z~2 that are intermediate between the most powerful radio and\nvigorous starburst galaxies in radio power, and common enough to represent a\ngeneric phase in the early evolution of massive galaxies.\n  The kinematic properties are diverse, with regular velocity gradients with\namplitudes of Delta v=200-400 km s^-1 as in rotating disks as well as irregular\nkinematics with multiple velocity jumps of a few 100 km s^-1. Line widths are\ngenerally high, typically around FWHM=800 km s^-1, consistent with wind\nvelocities in hydrodynamic models. A broad H-alpha line in one target implies a\nblack hole mass of a few 10^9 M$_sun. The ratio of line widths, sigma, to bulk\nvelocity, v, is so large that even the gas in galaxies with regular velocity\nfields is unlikely to be gravitationally bound. It is unclear, however, whether\nthe large line widths are due to turbulence or unresolved, local outflows as\nare sometimes observed at low redshifts. Comparison of the kinetic energy with\nthe energy supply from the AGN through jet and radiation pressure suggests that\nthe radio source still plays a dominant role for feedback, consistent with\nlow-redshift radio-loud quasars.\n", "  We compute 5-point classical conformal blocks with two heavy, two light, and\none superlight operator using the monodromy approach up to third order in the\nsuperlight expansion. By virtue of the AdS/CFT correspondence we show the\nequivalence of the resulting expressions to those obtained in the bulk\ncomputation for the corresponding geodesic configuration.\n", "  We prove some theorems about self-avoiding walks attached to an impenetrable\nsurface (i.e. positive walks) and subject to a force. Specifically we show the\nforce dependence of the free energy is identical when the force is applied at\nthe last vertex or at the top (confining) plane. We discuss the relevance of\nthis result to numerical results and to a recent result about convergence rates\nwhen the walk is being pushed towards the surface.\n", "  We present high resolution (0.3\") Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) 870um\nimaging of five z~1.5-4.5 X-ray detected AGN with luminosities of\nL(2-8keV)>10^42 erg/s. These data provide a >~20x improvement in spatial\nresolution over single-dish rest-frame FIR measurements. The sub-millimetre\nemission is extended on scales of FWHM~0.2\"-0.5\", corresponding to physical\nsizes of 1-3 kpc (median value of 1.8 kpc). These sizes are comparable to the\nmajority of z=1-5 sub-millimetre galaxies (SMGs) with equivalent ALMA\nmeasurements. In combination with spectral energy distribution analyses, we\nattribute this rest-frame far-infrared (FIR) emission to dust heated by star\nformation. The implied star-formation rate surface densities are ~20-200\nMo/yr/kpc^2, which are consistent with SMGs of comparable FIR luminosities\n(i.e., L(IR)~[1-5]x10^(12)Lo). Although limited by a small sample of AGN, which\nall have high FIR luminosities, our study suggests that the kpc-scale spatial\ndistribution and surface density of star formation in high-redshift\nstar-forming galaxies is the same irrespective of the presence of X-ray\ndetected AGN.\n", "  Measurements of intrinsic alignments of galaxy shapes with the large-scale\ndensity field, and the inferred intrinsic alignments model parameters, are\nsensitive to the shape measurement methods used. In this paper we measure the\nintrinsic alignments of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey-III (SDSS-III) Baryon\nOscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) LOWZ galaxies using three different\nshape measurement methods (re-Gaussianization, isophotal, and de Vaucouleurs),\nidentifying a variation in the inferred intrinsic alignments amplitude at the\n40% level between these methods, independent of the galaxy luminosity or other\nproperties. We also carry out a suite of systematics tests on the shapes and\ntheir two-point correlation functions, identifying a pronounced contribution\nfrom additive PSF systematics in the de Vaucouleurs shapes. Since different\nmethods measure galaxy shapes at different effective radii, the trends we\nidentify in the intrinsic alignments amplitude are consistent with the\ninterpretation that the outer regions of galaxy shapes are more responsive to\ntidal fields, resulting in isophote twisting and stronger alignments for\nisophotal shapes. We observe environment dependence of ellipticity, with\nbrightest galaxies in groups being rounder on average compared to satellite and\nfield galaxies. We also study the anisotropy in intrinsic alignments\nmeasurements introduced by projected shapes, finding effects consistent with\npredictions of the nonlinear alignment model and hydrodynamic simulations. The\nlarge variations seen using the different shape measurement methods have\nimportant implications for intrinsic alignments forecasting and mitigation with\nfuture surveys.\n", "  Production of the doubly heavy-flavored hadrons ($B_c$ meson, doubly heavy\nbaryons $\\Xi_{cc}$, $\\Xi_{bc}$, $\\Xi_{bb}$, their excited states and\nantiparticles of them as well) at $e^+e^-$ colliders is investigated under two\ndifferent approaches: $LO$ (leading order QCD complete calculation) and $LL$\n(leading logarithm fragmentation calculation). The results for the production\nobtained by the approaches $LO$ and $LL$, including the angle distributions of\nthe produced hadrons with unpolarized and polarized incoming beams, the\nbehaviors on the energy fraction of the produced doubly heavy hadron and\ncomparisons between the two approaches' results, are presented in terms of\ntables and figures. Thus characteristics of the production and uncertainties of\nthe approaches are shown precisely, and it is concluded that only if the\ncolliders run at the eneries around $Z$-pole (which may be called as\n$Z$-factories) and additionally the luminosity of the colliders is as high as\npossible then to study the doubly heavy hadrons thoroughly is accessible.\n", "  We investigate the extent to which theories of collective motion can capture\nthe physics that determines the nuclear matrix elements governing neutrinoless\ndouble-beta decay. To that end we calculate the matrix elements for a series of\nisotopes in the full $pf$ shell, omitting no spin-orbit partners. With the\ninclusion of isoscalar pairing, a separable collective Hamiltonian that is\nderived from the shell model effective interaction reproduces the full\nshell-model matrix elements with good accuracy. A version of the generator\ncoordinate method that includes the isoscalar pairing amplitude as a coordinate\nalso reproduces the shell model results well, an encouraging result for\ntheories of collective motion, which can include more single-particle orbitals\nthan the shell model. We briefly examine heavier nuclei relevant for\nexperimental double-beta decay searches, in which shell-model calculations with\nall spin-orbit partners are not feasible; our estimates suggest that isoscalar\npairing also plays a significant role in these nuclei, though one we are less\nable to quantify precisely.\n", "  In a combination of neutron and synchrotron diffraction the lattice constants\nand expansivities of hydrogenated and deuterated CH4-, CO2-, Xe- (structure\ntype I) and N2-hydrate (structure type II) from 10 K up to the stability limit\nunder pressure were established. Some important results emerge from our\nanalysis: (1) Despite the larger guest-size of CO2 as compared to methane, CO2-\nhydrate has the smaller lattice constants at low temperatures which we ascribe\nto the larger attractive guest-host interaction of the CO2-water system. (2)\nThe expansivity of CO2-hydrate is larger than for CH4-hydrate which leads to\nlarger lattice constants for the former at temperatures above ~ 150 K; this is\nlikely due to the higher motional degrees of freedom of the CO2 guest\nmolecules. (3) The cage filling does not affect significantly the lattice\nconstants in CH4- and CO2-hydrate in contrast to Xe-hydrate for which the\neffect is quantitatively established. (4) Similar to ice Ih, the deuterated\ncompounds have slightly larger lattice constants for all investigated systems\nwhich can be ascribed to the somewhat weaker H-bonding; the isotopic difference\nis smallest for the Xesystem,in which the large Xe atoms lead to an increase of\naveraged H-bond distances. (5) Compared to ice Ih the high temperature\nexpansivities are about 50% larger; in contrast to ice Ih, there is no negative\nthermal expansion at low temperature.\n", "  In recent charge-pump experiments, single electrons are injected into quantum\nHall edge channels at energies significantly above the Fermi level. We consider\nhere the relaxation of these hot edge-channel electrons through\nlongitudinal-optical phonon emission. Our results show that the probability for\nan electron in the outermost edge channel to emit one or more phonons en route\nto a detector some microns distant along the edge channel suffers a\ndouble-exponential suppression with increasing magnetic field. This explains\nrecent experimental observations. We also describe how the shape of the\narrival-time distribution of electrons at the detector reflects the velocities\nof the electronic states post phonon emission. We show how this can give rise\nto pronounced oscillations in the arrival-time-distribution width as a function\nof magnetic field or electron energy.\n", "  We search for environmental dependence of the HI mass function in the ALFALFA\n70% catalogue. The catalogue is split into quartiles of environment density\nbased on the projected neighbour density of neighbours found in both SDSS and\n2MRS volume limited reference catalogues. We find the Schechter function 'knee'\nmass to be dependent on environment, with the value of $\\log\n({M_{*}/\\mathrm{M_{\\odot}}})$ shifting from $9.81 \\pm 0.02$ to $10.00 \\pm 0.03$\nbetween the lowest and highest density quartiles. However, this dependence was\nonly observed when defining environment based on the SDSS reference catalogue,\nnot 2MRS. We interpret these results as meaning that the local environment is\nthe dominant cause of the shift in $M_{*}$, and that the larger scales that\n2MRS probes (compared to SDSS) are almost irrelevant. In addition, we also use\na fixed aperture method to probe environment, and find tentative evidence that\nHI-deficiency depresses the value of $M_{*}$ in the highest density regions. We\nfind no significant dependence of the low-mass slope on environment in any\ntest, using either method. Tensions between these results and those from the\nliterature, are discussed and alternative explanations are explored.\n", "  We demonstrate the feasibility of generation of quasi-stable\ncounter-propagating solitonic structures in an atomic Bose-Einstein condensate\nconfined in a realistic toroidal geometry, and identify optimal parameter\nregimes for their experimental observation. Using density engineering we\nnumerically identify distinct regimes of motion of the emerging macroscopic\nexcitations, including both solitonic motion along the azimuthal ring\ndirection, such that structures remain visible after multiple collisions even\nin the presence of thermal fluctuations, and snaking instabilities leading to\nthe decay of the excitations into vortical structures. Our analysis, which\nconsiders both mean field effects and fluctuations, is based on the ring trap\ngeometry of Murray et al. Phys. Rev. A 88 053615 2013.\n", "  The strongly coupled dusty plasma has often been modelled by the Generalized\nHydrodynamic (GHD) model used for representing visco-elastic fluid systems. The\nincompressible limit of the model which supports transverse shear wave mode is\nstudied in detail. In particular dipole structures are observed to emit\ntransverse shear waves in both the limits of sub and super - luminar\npropagation, where the structures move slower and faster than the phase\nvelocity of the shear waves, respectively. In the sub - luminar limit the\ndipole gets engulfed within the shear waves emitted by itself, which then\nbackreacts on it and ultimately the identity of the structure is lost. However,\nin the super - luminar limit the emission appears like a wake from the tail\nregion of the dipole. The dipole, however, keeps propagating forward with\nlittle damping but minimal distortion in its form. A Poynting like conservation\nlaw with radiative, convective and dissipative terms being responsible for the\nevolution of W , which is similar to `enstrophy' like quantity in normal\nhydrodynamic fluid systems, has also been constructed for the incompressible\nGHD equations. The conservation law is shown to be satisfied in all the cases\nof evolution and collision amidst the nonlinear structures to a great accuracy.\nIt is shown that monopole structures which do not move at all but merely\nradiate shear waves, the radiative term and dissipative losses solely\ncontribute to the evolution of W. The, dipolar structures, on the other hand,\npropagate in the medium and hence convection also plays an important role in\nthe evolution of W.\n", "  The so-called Lindley paradox is a counterintuitive statistical effect where\nthe Bayesian and frequentist approaches to hypothesis testing give radically\ndifferent answers, depending on the choice of the prior distribution. In this\npaper we address the occurrence of the Lindley paradox in optical\ninterferometry and discuss its implications for high-precision measurements. In\nparticular, we focus on phase estimation by Mach-Zehnder interferometers and\nshow how to mitigate the conflict between the two approaches by using suitable\npriors.\n", "  We report recent results on the dynamics of strange hadrons in two-body\nreactions relevant for near-threshold production in heavy-ion collisions at\nGSI/FAIR and NICA-Dubna. In particular, $\\bar K N$ scattering in hot and dense\nnuclear matter is studied within a chiral unitary framework in coupled\nchannels, setting up the starting point for implementations in microscopic\noff-shell transport approaches. We focus on the calculation of transition rates\nwith special attention to the excitation of hyperon resonances and isospin\neffects. Additionally, we explore \"unconventional\" strangeness generation by\nmeson-meson and meson-baryon interactions in connection with recent HADES\nobservations of deep sub-threshold $\\phi$ and $\\Xi$ production.\n", "  Cascaded stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) is a complex nonlinear optical\nprocess that results in the generation of several optical waves that are\nfrequency shifted by an acoustic resonance frequency. Four-wave mixing (FWM)\nbetween these Brillouin shifted optical waves can create an equally spaced\noptical frequency comb with a stable spectral phase, i.e. a Brillouin frequency\ncomb (BFC). Here, we investigate phase-locking of the spectral components of\nBFCs, considering FWM interactions arising from the Kerr-nonlinearity as well\nas from coupling by the acoustic field. Deriving for the first time the\ncoupled-mode equations that include all relevant nonlinear interactions, we\nexamine the contribution of the various nonlinear processes to phase-locking,\nand show that different regimes can be obtained that depend on the length scale\non which the field amplitudes vary.\n", "  The discovery of novae as sources of ~GeV gamma-rays highlights the key role\nof shocks and relativistic particle acceleration in these transient systems.\nAlthough there is evidence for a spectral cut-off above energies ~1-100 GeV at\nparticular epochs in some novae, the maximum particle energy achieved in these\naccelerators has remained an open question. The high densities of the nova\nejecta (~10 orders of magnitude larger than in supernova remnants) render the\ngas far upstream of the shock neutral and shielded from ionizing radiation. The\namplification of the magnetic field needed for diffusive shock acceleration\nrequires ionized gas, thus confining the acceleration process to a narrow\nphoto-ionized layer immediately ahead of the shock. Based on the growth rate in\nthis layer of the hybrid non-resonant cosmic ray current-driven instability\n(considering also ion-neutral damping), we quantify the maximum particle\nenergy, Emax, across the range of shock velocities and upstream densities of\ninterest. We find values of Emax ~ 10 GeV - 10 TeV, which are broadly\nconsistent with the inferred spectral cut-offs, but which could also in\nprinciple lead to emission extending to higher energies >100 GeV accessible to\natmosphere Cherenkov telescopes, such as the planned Cherenkov Telescope Array\n(CTA). Detecting TeV neutrinos with IceCube in hadronic scenarios appears to be\nmore challenging, although the prospects are improved if the shock power during\nthe earliest, densest phases of the nova outburst is higher than is implied by\nthe observed GeV light curves, due to downscattering of the gamma-rays by\nelectrons within the ejecta. Novae provide ideal nearby laboratories to study\nmagnetic field amplification and the onset of cosmic ray acceleration, because\nother time-dependent sources (e.g. radio supernovae) typically occur too\ndistant to detect as gamma-ray sources.\n", "  We present an analytic model for computing the luminosity and spectral\nevolution of flares caused by a supermassive black hole impacting the accretion\ndisc of another supermassive black hole. Our model includes photon diffusion,\nemission from optically thin regions and relativistic corrections to the\nobserved spectrum and time-scales. We test the observability of the impact\nscenario with a simulated population of quasars hosting supermassive black hole\nbinaries. The results indicate that for a moderate binary mass ratio of 0.3,\nand impact distances of 100 primary Schwarzschild radii, the accretion disc\nimpacts can be expected to equal or exceed the host quasar in brightness at\nobserved wavelength {\\lambda} = 510 nm up to z = 0.6. We conclude that\naccretion disc impacts may function as an independent probe for supermassive\nblack hole binaries. We release the code used for computing the model light\ncurves to the community.\n", "  We extend a machine learning (ML) framework presented previously to model\ngalaxy formation and evolution in a hierarchical universe using N-body +\nhydrodynamical simulations. In this work, we show that ML is a promising\ntechnique to study galaxy formation in the backdrop of a hydrodynamical\nsimulation. We use the Illustris Simulation to train and test various\nsophisticated machine learning algorithms. By using only essential dark matter\nhalo physical properties and no merger history, our model predicts the gas\nmass, stellar mass, black hole mass, star formation rate, $g-r$ color, and\nstellar metallicity fairly robustly. Our results provide a unique and powerful\nphenomenological framework to explore the galaxy-halo connection that is built\nupon a solid hydrodynamical simulation. The promising reproduction of the\nlisted galaxy properties demonstrably place ML as a promising and a\nsignificantly more computationally efficient tool to study small-scale\nstructure formation. We find that ML mimics a full-blown hydrodynamical\nsimulation surprisingly well in a computation time of mere minutes. The\npopulation of galaxies simulated by ML, while not numerically identical to\nIllustris, is statistically and physically robust and follows the same\nfundamental observational constraints. Machine learning offers an intriguing\nand promising technique to create quick mock galaxy catalogs in the future.\n", "  Understanding the extent to which experimental searches are sensitive to\nLight Stops (LST) scenarios is essential to resolve questions about\nnaturalness, electroweak baryogenesis and Dark Matter. In this paper we\ncharacterize the reach on LST scenarios in two ways. We extend experimental\nsearches to cover specific gaps in the LST parameter space, showing for the\nfirst time that assuming a single decay channel one can exclude the region of\n$m_{\\tilde{t}}<m_{top}$, which in its turn excludes electroweak baryogenesis in\nMSSM. Also, we explore the extent to which searches are weakened in a more\ngeneric scenario when more than one decay channel takes place, even after their\ncombination. This study highlights the need for a more comprehensive\nexploration of the LST parameter space.\n", "  We present the details of the analytic calculation of the three-loop\nangle-dependent cusp anomalous dimension in QCD and its supersymmetric\nextensions, including the maximally supersymmetric $\\mathcal{N}=4$ super\nYang-Mills theory. The three-loop result in the latter theory is new and\nconfirms a conjecture made in our previous paper. We study various physical\nlimits of the cusp anomalous dimension and discuss its relation to the\nquark-antiquark potential including the effects of broken conformal symmetry in\nQCD. We find that the cusp anomalous dimension viewed as a function of the cusp\nangle and the new effective coupling given by light-like cusp anomalous\ndimension reveals a remarkable universality property -- it takes the same form\nin QCD and its supersymmetric extensions, to three loops at least. We exploit\nthis universality property and make use of the known result for the three-loop\nquark-antiquark potential to predict the special class of nonplanar corrections\nto the cusp anomalous dimensions at four loops. Finally, we also discuss in\ndetail the computation of all necessary Wilson line integrals up to three loops\nusing the method of leading singularities and differential equations.\n", "  Non-linear ac magnetic susceptibility terms viz. quadratic, chi2, and cubic,\nchi3, were measured versus temperature and frequency for a series of the\nsigma-phase Fe(100-x)Mo(x) (47<x<53) compounds. Clear evidence was found that\nthe ground magnetic state of the samples is mixed i.e. constituted by two\nphases: a spin glass (SG) and a ferromagnet (FM), hence the magnetism of the\ninvestigated samples can be regarded as re-entrant (RSG). Based on the present\ndata, previously reported magnetic phase diagram has been upgraded [J.\nPrzewoznik, S. M. Dubiel,J. Alloy. Comp., 630 (2015) 222].\n", "  (abridged) Context: Both observations and simulations of embedded protostars\nhave progressed rapidly in recent years. Bringing them together is an important\nstep in advancing our knowledge about the earliest phases of star formation.\n  Aims: To compare synthetic continuum images and SEDs, calculated from\nlarge-scale numerical simulations, to observational studies, thereby aiding in\nboth the interpretation of the observations and in testing the fidelity of the\nsimulations.\n  Methods: The radiative transfer code RADMC-3D is used to create synthetic\ncontinuum images and SEDs of protostellar systems in a large numerical\nsimulation of a molecular cloud. More than 13000 unique radiative transfer\nmodels are produced of a variety of different protostellar systems.\n  Results: Over the course of 0.76 Myr the simulation forms more than 500\nprotostars, primarily within two sub-clusters. Synthetic SEDs are used to the\ncalculate evolutionary tracers Tbol and Lsmm/Lbol. It is shown that, while the\nobserved distributions of the tracers are well matched by the simulation, they\ngenerally do a poor job of tracking the protostellar ages. Disks form early in\nthe simulation, with 40 % of the Class 0 protostars being encircled by one. The\nflux emission from the simulated disks is found to be, on average, a factor of\n6 too low relative to real observations. The distribution of protostellar\nluminosities spans more than three order of magnitudes, similar to the observed\ndistribution. Cores and protostars are found to be closely associated with one\nanother, with the distance distribution between them being in excellent\nagreement with observations.\n  Conclusions: The analysis and statistical comparison of synthetic\nobservations to real ones is established as a powerful tool in the\ninterpretation of observational results.\n", "  We construct the minimal dark matter models in the left-right symmetric\nextensions of the standard model (SM), where the gauge symmetry\nSU(3)$_C\\times$SU(2)$_L\\times$SU(2)$_R\\times$U(1)$_{B-L}$ is broken into its\nsubgroup SU(3)$_C\\times$U(1)$_{\\rm em}$ by nonzero VEVs of a SU(2)$_R$ doublet\n$H_R$ and a SU(2)$_L\\times$ SU(2)$_R$ bidoublet $H$. A possible candidate of\ndark matter is explored in the framework of minimal dark matter considering\nSU(2)$_{L, R}$ multiplet scalar bosons and fermions. Then we focus on SU(2)$_R$\nquintuplet fermions with $B-L$ charges 0, 2 and 4 as the minimal dark matter\ncandidates and investigate phenomenology of them. We show that the dark matter\nin the model can provide observed relic density with 2 TeV $W'$ boson which is\nmotivated by the ATLAS diboson excess and CMS $eejj$ excess. The possible mass\nof dark matter is predicted for each $B-L$ charge. We then estimate the\nscattering cross section of dark matter with nucleon and production cross\nsection of charged components in the quintuplets at the LHC.\n", "  We study the dynamical response of extended systems, hosts, to smaller\nsystems, satellites, orbiting around the hosts using extremely high-resolution\nN-body simulations with up to one billion particles. This situation corresponds\nto minor mergers which are ubiquitous in the scenario of hierarchical structure\nformation in the universe. According to Chandrasekhar (1943), satellites create\ndensity wakes along the orbit and the wakes cause a deceleration force on\nsatellites, i.e. dynamical friction. This study proposes an analytical model to\npredict the dynamical response of hosts as reflected in their density\ndistribution and finds not only traditional wakes but also mirror images of\nover- and underdensities centered on the host. Our controlled N-body\nsimulations with high resolutions verify the predictions of the analytical\nmodel. We apply our analytical model to the expected dynamical response of\nnearby interacting galaxy pairs, the Milky Way - Large Magellanic Cloud system\nand the M31 - M33 system.\n", "  This paper revisits the question of reconstructing bulk gauge fields as\nboundary operators in AdS/CFT. In the presence of the wormhole dual to the\nthermofield double state of two CFTs, the existence of bulk gauge fields is in\nsome tension with the microscopic tensor factorization of the Hilbert space. I\nexplain how this tension can be resolved by splitting the gauge field into\ncharged constituents, and I argue that this leads to a new argument for the\n\"principle of completeness\", which states that the charge lattice of a gauge\ntheory coupled to gravity must be fully populated. I also claim that it leads\nto a new motivation for (and a clarification of) the \"weak gravity conjecture\",\nwhich I interpret as a strengthening of this principle. This setup gives a\nsimple example of a situation where describing low-energy bulk physics in CFT\nlanguage requires knowledge of high-energy bulk physics. This contradicts to\nsome extent the notion of \"effective conformal field theory\", but in fact is an\nexpected feature of the resolution of the black hole information problem. An\nanalogous factorization issue exists also for the gravitational field, and I\ncomment on several of its implications for reconstructing black hole interiors\nand the emergence of spacetime more generally.\n", "  We propose a new framework for the next-to-minimal supersymmetric standard\nmodel (NMSSM) in gauge mediation, where in general the correct electroweak\nsymmetry breaking (EWSB) is difficult to be explained. The difficulty is caused\nby the absence of a soft supersymmetry (SUSY) breaking mass for the NMSSM\nsinglet S. In our framework, S is a meson in a hidden QCD. This QCD is\nresponsible for the dynamical SUSY breaking, forming S, and the soft SUSY\nbreaking mass for S, which is a key to explain the correct EWSB: all the\ningredients for successful phenomenology originate from the common dynamics.\nFrom the requirement of the successful EWSB, the low-scale SUSY breaking around\n100-1000 TeV is predicted. This is favored to avoid the large fine-tuning.\n", "  Vacuum magnetic birefringence was predicted long time ago and is still\nlacking a direct experimental confirmation. Several experimental efforts are\nstriving to reach this goal, and the sequence of results promises a success in\nthe next few years. This measurement generally is accompanied by the search for\nhypothetical light particles that couple to two photons. The PVLAS experiment\nemploys a sensitive polarimeter based on a high finesse Fabry-Perot cavity. In\nthis paper we report on the latest experimental results of this experiment. The\ndata are analysed taking into account the intrinsic birefringence of the\ndielectric mirrors of the cavity. Besides the limit on the vacuum magnetic\nbirefringence, the measurements also allow the model-independent exclusion of\nnew regions in the parameter space of axion-like and milli-charged particles.\nIn particular, these last limits hold also for all types of neutrinos,\nresulting in a laboratory limit on their charge.\n", "  We study pairs of co-axial vortex rings starting from the action for a\nclassical bosonic string in a three-form background. We complete earlier work\non the phase diagram of classical orbits by explicitly considering the case\nwhere the circulations of the two vortex rings are equal and opposite. We then\ngo on to study perturbations, focusing on cases where the relevant\nfour-dimensional transfer matrix splits into two-dimensional blocks. When the\ncirculations of the rings have the same sign, instabilities are mostly limited\nto wavelengths smaller than a dynamically generated length scale at which\nsingle-ring instabilities occur. When the circulations have the opposite sign,\nlarger wavelength instabilities can occur.\n", "  We expand the previous analyses of the conformal barrier on the walking\ntechnirho for the 2 TeV diboson excesses reported by the ATLAS collaboration,\nwith a special emphasis on the hidden local symmetry (HLS) constraints. We\nfirst show that the Standard Model (SM) Higgs Lagrangian is equivalent to the\nscale-invariant nonlinear chiral Lagrangian, which is further gauge equivalent\nto the scale-invariant HLS model, with the scale symmetry realized nonlinearly\nvia SM Higgs as a (pseudo-) dilaton. The scale symmetry forbids the new vector\nboson decay to the 125 GeV Higgs plus W/Z boson, in sharp contrast to the\nconventional \"equivalence theorem\" which is invalidated by the conformality.\nThe HLS forbids mixing between the iso-triplet technirho's, rho_{Pi} and\nrho_{P}, of the one-family walking technicolor (with four doublets\nN_D=N_F/2=4), which, without the HLS, would be generated when switching on the\nstandard model gauging. We also present updated analyses of the walking\ntechnrho's for the diboson excesses by fully incorporating the constraints from\nthe conformal barrier and the HLS as well as possible higher order effects:\nstill characteristic of the one-family walking technirho is its smallness of\nthe decay width, roughly of order Gamma/M_rho ~ [3/N_C x 1/N_D] x\n[Gamma/M_rho]_{QCD} ~ 70 GeV/2TeV (N_D= N_C=4), in perfect agreement with the\nexpected diboson resonance with Gamma<100 GeV. The model is so sharply\ndistinguishable from other massive spin 1 models without the conformality and\nHLS that it is clearly testable at the LHC Run II. If the 2 TeV boson decay to\nWH/ZH is not observed in the ongoing Run II, then the conformality is operative\non the 125 GeV Higgs, strongly suggesting that the 2 TeV excess events are\nresponsible for the walking technirhos and the 125 GeV Higgs is the\ntechnidilaton.\n", "  Coronal rain clumps and prominence knots are dense condensations with\nchromospheric to transition region temperatures that fall down in the much\nhotter corona. Their typical speeds are in the range 30--150~km~s$^{-1}$ and of\nthe order of 10--30~km~s$^{-1}$, respectively, i.e., they are considerably\nsmaller than free fall velocities. These cold blobs contain a mixture of\nionized and neutral material that must be dynamically coupled in order to fall\ntogether, as observed. We investigate this coupling by means of hydrodynamic\nsimulations in which the coupling arises from the friction between ions and\nneutrals. The numerical simulations presented here are an extension of those of\n\\citet{oliver2014} to the partially ionized case. We find that, although the\nrelative drift speed between the two species is smaller than 1~m~s$^{-1}$ at\nthe blob center, it is sufficient to produce the forces required to strongly\ncouple charged particles and neutrals. The ionization degree has no discernible\neffect on the main results of our previous work for a fully ionized plasma: the\ncondensation has an initial acceleration phase followed by a period with\nroughly constant velocity and, in addition, the maximum descending speed is\nclearly correlated with the ratio of initial blob to environment density.\n", "  It is well-known but sometimes overlooked that constraints on the oblique\nparameters (most notably $S$ and $T$ parameters) are generally speaking only\napplicable to a special class of new physics scenarios known as universal\ntheories. In the effective field theory (EFT) framework, the oblique parameters\nshould not be associated with Wilson coefficients in a particular operator\nbasis, unless restrictions have been imposed on the EFT so that it describes\nuniversal theories. We work out these restrictions, and present a detailed EFT\nanalysis of universal theories. We find that at the dimension-6 level,\nuniversal theories are completely characterized by 16 parameters. They are\nconveniently chosen to be: 5 oblique parameters that agree with the\ncommonly-adopted ones, 4 anomalous triple-gauge couplings, 3 rescaling factors\nfor the $h^3$, $hff$, $hVV$ vertices, 3 parameters for $hVV$ vertices absent in\nthe Standard Model, and 1 four-fermion coupling of order $y_f^2$. All these\nparameters are defined in an unambiguous and basis-independent way, allowing\nfor consistent constraints on the universal theories parameter space from\nprecision electroweak and Higgs data.\n", "  Most star clusters at an intermediate age (1-2 Gyr) in the Large and Small\nMagellanic Clouds show a puzzling feature in their color-magnitude diagrams\n(CMD) that is not in agreement with a simple stellar population. The main\nsequence turn-off of these clusters is much broader than would be expected from\nphotometric uncertainties. One interpretation of this feature is that age\nspreads of the order 200-500 Myr exist within individual clusters, although\nthis interpretation is highly debated. Such large age spreads should affect\nother parts of the CMD, which are sensitive to age, as well. In this study, we\nanalyze the CMDs of a sample of 12 intermediate-age clusters in the Large\nMagellanic Cloud that all show an extended turn-off using archival optical data\ntaken with the Hubble Space Telescope. We fit the star formation history of the\nturn-off region and the red clump region independently with two different\ntheoretical isochrone models. We find that in most of the cases, the age\nspreads inferred from the red clumps are smaller than the ones resulting from\nthe turn-off region. However, the age ranges resulting from the red clump\nregion are broader than would be expected for a single age. Only two out of 12\nclusters in our sample show a red clump which seems to be consistent with a\nsingle age. As our results are not unambiguous, we can not ultimately tell if\nthe extended main sequence turn-off feature is due to an age spread, or not, by\nfitting the star formation histories to the red clump regions. However, we find\nthat the width of the extended main sequence turn-off feature is correlated\nwith the age of the clusters in a way which would be unexplained in the \"age\nspread\" interpretation, but which may be expected if stellar rotation is the\ncause of the spread at the turn-off.\n", "  We show how to refine conformal block expansion convergence estimates from\nhep-th/1208.6449. In doing so we find a novel explicit formula for the 3d\nconformal blocks on the real axis.\n", "  We investigate the backreaction of the Affleck-Dine leptogenesis to inflaton\ndynamics in the F-term hybrid and chaotic inflation models in supergravity. We\ndetermine the lightest neutrino mass in both models so that the predictions of\nspectral index, tensor-to-scalar ratio, and baryon abundance are consistent\nwith observations.\n", "  We present a revisited version of the nonextensive QCD-based Nambu -\nJona-Lasinio (NJL) model describing the behavior of strongly interacting matter\nproposed by us some time ago. As before, it is based on the nonextensive\ngeneralization of the Boltzmann-Gibbs (BG) statistical mechanics used in the\nNJL model to its nonextensive version based on Tsallis statistics, but this\ntime it fulfils the basic requirements of thermodynamical consistency.\nDifferent ways in which this can be done, connected with different possible\nchoices of the form of the corresponding nonextensive entropies, are presented\nand discussed in detail. The corresponding results are compared, discussed and\nconfronted with previous findings.\n", "  Magnetoresistance and Hall resistance measurements have been carried out in\nfastcooled single crystals of Bi2Se3-xTex (x: 0 to 2) in 4 to 300 K temperature\nrange, under magnetic fields up to 15 T. The variation of resistivity with\ntemperature that points to a metallic behaviour in Bi2Se3, shows an upturn at\nlow temperatures in the Te doped samples. Magnetoresistance measurements in\nBi2Se3 show clear signatures of Shubnikov de Hass oscillations that gets\nsuppressed in the Te doped samples. In the Bi2SeTe2 sample, the\nmagneto-resistance shows a cusp like positive magneto-resistance at low\nmagnetic fields and low temperatures, a feature associated with weak\nantilocalisation (WAL), that crosses over to negative magneto-resistance at\nhigher fields. The qualitatively different magnetotransport behaviour seen in\nBi2SeTe2 as compared to Bi2Se3 is rationalised in terms of the disorder,\nthrough an estimate of the carrier density, carrier mobility and an analysis in\nterms of the Ioffe Regel criterion with support from Hall Effect measurements.\n", "  Fluctuation theorems play a central role in nonequilibrium physics and\nstochastic thermodynamics. Here we derive an integral fluctuation theorem for\nthe dissipated heat in systems governed by an underdamped Langevin dynamics. We\nshow that this identity may be used to predict the occurrence of extreme events\nleading to exponential tails in the probability distribution functions of the\nheat and related quantities.\n", "  A classical-kind phase-space formalism is developed to address the tiny\nintrinsic dynamical deviation from what is predicted by Wilczek-Zee theorem\nduring quantum adiabatic evolution on degeneracy levels. In this formalism, the\nHilbert space and the aggregate of degenerate eigenstates become the\nclassical-kind phase-space and a high-dimensional subspace in the phase-space,\nrespectively. Compared with the previous same study by a different method, the\ncurrent result is qualitatively different in that the first-order deviation\nderived here is always perpendicular to the degeneracy subspace. A tripod\nscheme Hamiltonian with two degenerate dark states is employed to illustrate\nthe adiabatic deviation with degeneracy levels.\n", "  Isolated magnetic white dwarfs have field strengths ranging from kilogauss to\ngigagauss, and constitute an interesting class of objects. The origin of the\nmagnetic field is still the subject of a hot debate. Whether these fields are\nfossil, hence the remnants of original weak magnetic fields amplified during\nthe course of the evolution of the progenitor of white dwarfs, or on the\ncontrary, are the result of binary interactions or, finally, other physical\nmechanisms that could produce such large magnetic fields during the evolution\nof the white dwarf itself, remains to be elucidated. In this work we review the\ncurrent status and paradigms of magnetic fields in white dwarfs, from both the\ntheoretical and observational points of view.\n", "  An essential part of any factorisation proof is the demonstration that the\nexchange of Glauber gluons cancels for the considered observable. We show this\ncancellation at all orders for double Drell-Yan production (the double parton\nscattering process in which a pair of electroweak gauge bosons is produced)\nboth for the integrated cross section and for the cross section differential in\nthe transverse boson momenta. In the process of constructing this proof, we\nalso revisit and clarify some issues regarding the Glauber cancellation\nargument and its relation to the rest of the factorisation proof for the single\nDrell-Yan process.\n", "  This monograph offers an overview on the topological invariants in fermionic\ntopological insulators from the complex classes. Tools from K-theory and\nnon-commutative geometry are used to define bulk and boundary invariants, to\nestablish the bulk-boundary correspondence and to link the invariants to\nphysical observables.\n", "  We study the prediction for the Higgs transverse momentum distribution in\ngluon fusion and focus on the problem of matching fixed- and all-order\nperturbative results. The main sources of matching ambiguities on this\ndistribution are investigated by means of a twofold comparison. On the one\nhand, we present a detailed qualitative and quantitative comparison of two\nrecently introduced algorithms for determining the matching scale. On the other\nhand, we apply the results of both methods to three widely used approaches for\nthe resummation of logarithmically enhanced contributions at small transverse\nmomenta: the MC@NLO and POWHEG Monte Carlo approaches, and analytic\nresummation. While the three sets of results are largely compatible in the\nlow-pT region, they exhibit sizable differences at large pT. We show that these\ndifferences can be significantly reduced by suitable modifications of formally\nsubleading terms in the Monte Carlo implementations. We apply our study to the\nStandard Model Higgs boson and to the neutral Higgs bosons of the\nTwo-Higgs-Doublet Model for representative scenarios of the parameter space,\nwhere the top- and bottom-quark diagrams enter the cross section at different\nstrength.\n", "  We analyse the largest spectroscopic samples of galaxy clusters to date, and\nprovide observational constraints on the distance-redshift relation from baryon\nacoustic oscillations. The cluster samples considered in this work have been\nextracted from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey at three median redshifts, $z=0.2$,\n$z=0.3$, and $z=0.5$. The number of objects is $12910$, $42215$, and $11816$,\nrespectively. We detect the peak of baryon acoustic oscillations for all the\nthree samples. The derived distance constraints are: $r_s/D_V(z=0.2)=0.18 \\pm\n0.01$, $r_s/D_V(z=0.3)=0.124 \\pm 0.004$ and $r_s/D_V(z=0.5)=0.080 \\pm 0.002$.\nCombining these measurements, we obtain robust constraints on cosmological\nparameters. Our results are in agreement with the standard $\\Lambda$ cold dark\nmatter model. Specifically, we constrain the Hubble constant in a $\\Lambda$CDM\nmodel, $H_0 = 64_{-9}^{+14} \\, \\mathrm{km} \\,\n\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, the density of curvature energy, in the\n$o\\Lambda$CDM context, $\\Omega_K = -0.015_{-0.36}^{+0.34}$, and finally the\nparameter of the dark energy equation of state in the $ow$CDM case, $w =\n-1.01_{-0.44}^{+0.44}$. This is the first time the distance-redshift relation\nhas been constrained using only the peak of baryon acoustic oscillations of\ngalaxy clusters.\n", "  During the last ~50 years, the population of black hole candidates in X-ray\nbinaries has increased considerably with 59 Galactic objects detected in\ntransient low-mass X-ray binaries, plus a few in persistent systems (including\n~5 extragalactic binaries). We collect near-infrared, optical and X-ray\ninformation spread over hundreds of references in order to study the population\nof black holes in X-ray transients as a whole. We present the most updated\ncatalogue of black hole transients, which contains X-ray, optical and\nnear-infrared observations together with their astrometric and dynamical\nproperties. It provides new useful information in both statistical and\nobservational parameters providing a thorough and complete overview of the\nblack hole population in the Milky Way. Analysing the distances and spatial\ndistribution of the observed systems, we estimate a total population of ~1300\nGalactic black hole transients. This means that we have already discovered less\nthan ~5% of the total Galactic distribution. The complete version of this\ncatalogue will be continuously updated online and in the Virtual Observatory,\nincluding finding charts and data in other wavelengths.\n", "  We show that in any two dimensional conformal field theory with (2, 2)\nsupersymmetry one can define a supersymmetric analog of the usual Renyi entropy\nof a spatial region A. It differs from the Renyi entropy by a universal\nfunction (which we compute) of the central charge, Renyi parameter n and the\ngeometric parameters of A. In the limit $n \\to1$ it coincides with the\nentanglement entropy. Thus, it contains the same information as the Renyi\nentropy but its computation only involves correlation functions of chiral and\nanti-chiral operators. We also show that this quantity appears naturally in\nstring theory on $AdS_3$.\n", "  We report a study of high harmonic generation from noble gas clusters of\nxenon atoms in a gas jet. Harmonic spectra were investigated as a function of\nbacking pressure, showing spectral shifts due to the nanoplasma electrons in\nthe clusters. At certain value of laser intensity this process may oppose the\neffect of the well-known ionization-induced blueshift. In addition, these\ncluster-induced harmonic redshifts may give the possibility to estimate cluster\ndensity and cluster size in the laser-gas jet interaction range.\n", "  Nonlinear conductivity of point contacts (PCs) on the base of FeSe single\ncrystals has been investigated. Measured dV/dI dependencies demonstrate the\nprevailing contribution to the PC conductivity caused by the degraded surface.\nSuperconducting (SC) feature in dV/dI like a sharp zero-bias minimum develops\nfor relatively low ohmic PCs, where the deep areas of FeSe are involved.\nAnalysis of dV/dI has shown that the origin of the zero-bias minimum is\nconnected with the Maxwell part of the PC resistance, what masks energy\ndependent spectral peculiarities. Even so, we have found the specific features\nin dV/dI - the sharp side maxima, which may have connection to the SC gap,\nsince their position follows the BCS temperature dependence. Exploring the\ndV/dI spectra of the rare occurrence with Andreev-like structure, the two gaps\nwith Delta = 2.5 and 3.5 meV were identified.\n", "  We provide the classification of real forms of complex D=4 Euclidean algebra\n$\\mathcal{\\epsilon}(4; \\mathbb{C}) = \\mathfrak{o}(4;\\mathbb{C})) \\ltimes\n\\mathbf{T}_{\\mathbb{C}}^4$ as well as (pseudo)real forms of complex D=4\nEuclidean superalgebras $\\mathcal{\\epsilon}(4|N; \\mathbb{C})$ for N=1,2.\nFurther we present our results: N=1 and N=2 supersymmetric D=4 Poincare and\nEuclidean r-matrices obtained by using D= 4 Poincare r-matrices provided by\nZakrzewski [1]. For N=2 we shall consider the general superalgebras with two\ncentral charges.\n", "  We propose a way to understand the evolution of an open quantum system using\na description that dispenses a continuous evolution in time, by discrete\noperators entangled states, in its most direct and fundamental way. We show\nthat the successive application of these operators in very small time intervals\nreproduce continuous evolution. It describes and compares the temporal\nevolution of an open quantum system of three levels, for which the Lindblad\nequation is solved to obtain the density matrix function of time, a method is\ndeveloped to find Kraus operators time dependent and also finds constant Kraus\noperators differentials operate computationally $ n $ times evolving in\ndiscrete-time $ \\Delta t = \\tau = t / n $. It is seen in the example of atom\ncavity inside a reservoir that by calculating the distance and the relative\nerror we define is a relationship with the evolution of discrete steps and\nphysical variables as $ \\omega $ which presuppose a natural discretization\nfound time.\n", "  This work presents a new silicon vertical JFET (V-JFET) device, based on the\ntrenched 3D-detector technology developed at IMB-CNM, to be used as switches\nfor the High-Voltage powering scheme of the ATLAS upgrade Inner Tracker. The\noptimization of the device characteristics is performed by 2D and 3D TCAD\nsimulations. Special attention has been paid to the on-resistance and the\nswitch-off and breakdown voltages to meet the specific requirements of the\nsystem. In addition, a set of parameter values has been extracted from the\nsimulated curves to implement a SPICE model of the proposed V-JFET transistor.\nAs these devices are expected to operate under very high radiation conditions\nduring the whole experiment life-time, a study of the radiation damage effects\nand the expected degradation on the device performance is also presented at the\nend of the paper.\n", "  We show that simple thermodynamic conditions determine, to a great extent,\nthe equation of state and dynamics of cosmic defects of arbitrary\ndimensionality. We use these conditions to provide a more direct derivation of\nthe Velocity-dependent One-Scale (VOS) model for the macroscopic dynamics of\ntopological defects of arbitrary dimensionality in a $N+1$-dimensional\nhomogeneous and isotropic universe. We parameterize the modifications to the\nVOS model associated to the interaction of the topological defects with other\nfields, including, in particular, a new dynamical degree of freedom associated\nto the variation of the mass per unit $p$-area of the defects, and compute the\ncorresponding scaling solutions. The observational impact of this new dynamical\ndegree of freedom is also briefly discussed.\n", "  The electric-field noise above a layered structure composed of a planar metal\nelectrode covered by a thin dielectric is evaluated and it is found that the\ndielectric film considerably increases the noise level, in proportion to its\nthickness. Importantly, even a thin (mono) layer of a low-loss dielectric can\nenhance the noise level by several orders of magnitude compared to the noise\nabove a bare metal. Close to this layered surface, the power spectral density\nof the electric field varies with the inverse fourth power of the distance to\nthe surface, rather than with the inverse square, as it would above a bare\nmetal surface. Furthermore, compared to a clean metal, where the noise spectrum\ndoes not vary with frequency (in the radio-wave and microwave bands), the\ndielectric layer can generate electric-field noise which scales in inverse\nproportion to the frequency. For various realistic scenarios, the noise levels\npredicted from this model are comparable to those observed in trapped-ion\nexperiments. Thus, these findings are of particular importance for the\nunderstanding and mitigation of unwanted heating and decoherence in\nminiaturized ion traps.\n", "  While giant extrasolar planets have been studied for more than two decades\nnow, there are still some open questions such as their dominant formation and\nmigration process, as well as their atmospheric evolution in different stellar\nenvironments. In this paper, we study a sample of giant transiting exoplanets\ndetected by the Kepler telescope with orbital periods up to 400 days. We first\ndefined a sample of 129 giant-planet candidates that we followed up with the\nSOPHIE spectrograph (OHP, France) in a 6-year radial velocity campaign. This\nallow us to unveil the nature of these candidates and to measure a\nfalse-positive rate of 54.6 +/- 6.5 % for giant-planet candidates orbiting\nwithin 400 days of period. Based on a sample of confirmed or likely planets, we\nthen derive the occurrence rates of giant planets in different ranges of\norbital periods. The overall occurrence rate of giant planets within 400 days\nis 4.6 +/- 0.6 %. We recover, for the first time in the Kepler data, the\ndifferent populations of giant planets reported by radial velocity surveys.\nComparing these rates with other yields, we find that the occurrence rate of\ngiant planets is lower only for hot jupiters but not for the longer period\nplanets. We also derive a first measurement on the occurrence rate of brown\ndwarfs in the brown-dwarf desert with a value of 0.29 +/- 0.17 %. Finally, we\ndiscuss the physical properties of the giant planets in our sample. We confirm\nthat giant planets receiving a moderate irradiation are not inflated but we\nfind that they are in average smaller than predicted by formation and evolution\nmodels. In this regime of low-irradiated giant planets, we find a possible\ncorrelation between their bulk density and the Iron abundance of the host star,\nwhich needs more detections to be confirmed.\n", "  We estimate constraints on the existence of a heavy, mostly sterile neutrino\nwith mass between 10 eV and 1 TeV. We improve upon previous analyses by\nperforming a global combination and expanding the experimental inputs to\nsimultaneously include tests for lepton universality, lepton-flavor-violating\nprocesses, electroweak precision data, dipole moments, and neutrinoless double\nbeta decay. Assuming the heavy neutrino and its decay products are invisible to\ndetection, we further include, in a self-consistent manner, constraints from\ndirect kinematic searches, the kinematics of muon decay, cosmology, and\nneutrino oscillations, in order to estimate constraints on the values of\n$|U_{e4}|^2$, $|U_{\\mu4}|^2$, and $|U_{\\tau4}|^2$.\n", "  We consider general black hole solutions of Einstein-Maxwell-scalar theory\nthat are holographically dual to conformal field theories at finite charge\ndensity with non-vanishing magnetic fields and local magnetisation currents,\nwhich generically break translation invariance explicitly. We show that the\nthermoelectric DC conductivity of the field theory can be obtained by solving a\nsystem of generalised Stokes equations on the black hole horizon. For various\nexamples, including Q-lattices and one-dimensional lattices, we solve the\nStokes equations explicitly and obtain expressions for the DC conductivity in\nterms of the solution at the black hole horizon.\n", "  How to quantify the impact of a researcher's or an institution's body of work\nis a matter of increasing importance to scientists, funding agencies, and\nhiring committees. The use of bibliometric indicators, such as the h-index or\nthe Journal Impact Factor, have become widespread despite their known\nlimitations. We argue that most existing bibliometric indicators are\ninconsistent, biased, and, worst of all, susceptible to manipulation. Here, we\npursue a principled approach to the development of an indicator to quantify the\nscientific impact of both individual researchers and research institutions\ngrounded on the functional form of the distribution of the asymptotic number of\ncitations. We validate our approach using the publication records of 1,283\nresearchers from seven scientific and engineering disciplines and the chemistry\ndepartments at the 106 U.S. research institutions classified as \"very high\nresearch activity\". Our approach has three distinct advantages. First, it\naccurately captures the overall scientific impact of researchers at all career\nstages, as measured by asymptotic citation counts. Second, unlike other\nmeasures, our indicator is resistant to manipulation and rewards publication\nquality over quantity. Third, our approach captures the time-evolution of the\nscientific impact of research institutions.\n", "  We derive the most general sets of viable mass spectra of the exotic Higgs\nbosons in the Georgi-Machacek model that are consistent with the theoretical\nconstraints of vacuum stability and perturbative unitarity and the experimental\nconstraints of electroweak precision observables, $Zb \\bar b$ coupling and\nHiggs boson signal strengths. Branching ratios of various cascade decay\nchannels of the doubly-charged Higgs boson in the ${\\bf 5}$ representation, the\nsingly-charged Higgs boson in ${\\bf 3}$, and the singlet Higgs boson are\nfurther computed. As one of the most promising channels for discovering the\nmodel, we study the prospects for detecting the doubly-charged Higgs boson that\nis produced via the vector boson fusion process and decays into final states\ncontaining a pair of same-sign leptons at the 14-TeV LHC and a 100-TeV future\n$pp$ collider. For this purpose, we evaluate acceptance times efficiency for\nsignals of the doubly-charged Higgs boson with general viable mass spectra and\ncompare it with the standard model background estimates.\n", "  We identify features in the angle-resolved photoemission spectra (ARPES)\narising from the periodic pattern characteristic for graphene heterostructure\nwith hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). For this, we model ARPES spectra and\nintensity maps for five microscopic models used previously to describe moire\nsuperlattice in graphene/hBN systems. We show that detailed analysis of these\nfeatures can be used to pin down the microscopic mechanism of the interaction\nbetween graphene and hBN. We also analyze how the presence of a moire-periodic\nstrain in graphene or scattering of photoemitted electrons off hBN can be\ndistinguished from the miniband formation.\n", "  The processes of neutrino production of electron-positron pairs, $\\nu \\bar\\nu\n\\to e^- e^+$ and $\\nu \\to \\nu e^- e^+$, in a magnetic field of arbitrary\nstrength, where electrons and positrons can be created in the states\ncorresponding to excited Landau levels, are analysed. The results can be\napplied for calculating the efficiency of the electron-positron plasma\nproduction by neutrinos in the conditions of the Kerr black hole accretion disc\nconsidered by experts as the most possible source of a short cosmological gamma\nburst.\n", "  We demonstrate a scheme for magneto-optically trapping strontium monofluoride\n(SrF) molecules at temperatures one order of magnitude lower and phase space\ndensities three orders of magnitude higher than obtained previously with\nlaser-cooled molecules. In our trap, optical dark states are destabilized by\nrapidly and synchronously reversing the trapping laser polarizations and the\napplied magnetic field gradient. The number of molecules and trap lifetime are\nalso significantly improved from previous work by loading the trap with high\nlaser power and then reducing the power for long-term trapping. With this\nprocedure, temperatures as low as 400 $\\mu$K are achieved.\n", "  Spectroscopic methods are a sensitive way to determine the chemical\ncomposition of potentially hazardous materials. Here, we demonstrate that\nthermally-tuned high-Q photonic crystal cavities can be used as a compact\nhigh-resolution on-chip spectrometer. We have used such a chip-scale\nspectrometer to measure the absorption spectra of both acetylene and hydrogen\ncyanide in the 1550 nm spectral band, and show that we can discriminate between\nthe two chemical species even though the two materials have spectral features\nin the same spectral region. Our results pave the way for the development of\nchip-size chemical sensors that can detect toxic substances.\n", "  The Local Group of galaxies offer some of the most discriminating tests of\nmodels of cosmic structure formation. For example, observations of the Milky\nWay (MW) and Andromeda satellite populations appear to be in disagreement with\nN-body simulations of the \"Lambda Cold Dark Matter\" ({\\Lambda}CDM) model: there\nare far fewer satellite galaxies than substructures in cold dark matter halos\n(the \"missing satellites\" problem); dwarf galaxies seem to avoid the most\nmassive substructures (the \"too-big-to-fail\" problem); and the brightest\nsatellites appear to orbit their host galaxies on a thin plane (the \"planes of\nsatellites\" problem). Here we present results from APOSTLE (A Project Of\nSimulating The Local Environment), a suite of cosmological hydrodynamic\nsimulations of twelve volumes selected to match the kinematics of the Local\nGroup (LG) members. Applying the Eagle code to the LG environment, we find that\nour simulations match the observed abundance of LG galaxies, including the\nsatellite galaxies of the MW and Andromeda. Due to changes to the structure of\nhalos and the evolution in the LG environment, the simulations reproduce the\nobserved relation between stellar mass and velocity dispersion of individual\ndwarf spheroidal galaxies without necessitating the formation of cores in their\ndark matter profiles. Satellite systems form with a range of spatial\nanisotropies, including one similar to that of the MW, confirming that such a\nconfiguration is not unexpected in {\\Lambda}CDM. Finally, based on the observed\nvelocity dispersion, size, and stellar mass, we provide new estimates of the\nmaximum circular velocity for the halos of nine MW dwarf spheroidals.\n", "  The procedure for calculation of the QCD evolution of transverse momentum\ndependent distributions within the covariant approach is suggested. The\nstandard collinear QCD evolution together with the requirements of relativistic\ninvariance and rotational symmetry of the nucleon in its rest frame represent\nthe basic ingredients of our approach. The obtained results are compared with\nthe predictions of some other approaches.\n", "  The cascade of kinetic Alfv\\'en waves (KAWs) at the sub-ion scales in the\nsolar wind is numerically simulated using a fluid approach that retains ion and\nelectron Landau damping, together with ion finite Larmor radius corrections.\nAssuming initially equal and isotropic ion and electron temperatures, and an\nion beta equal to unity, different simulations are performed by varying the\npropagation direction and the amplitude of KAWs that are randomly driven at a\ntransverse scale of about one fifth of the proton gyroradius in order to\nmaintain a prescribed level of turbulent fluctuations. The resulting turbulent\nregimes are characterized by the nonlinearity parameter, defined as the ratio\nof the characteristic times of Alfv\\'en wave propagation and of the transverse\nnonlinear dynamics. The corresponding transverse magnetic energy spectra\ndisplay power laws with exponents spanning a range of values consistent with\nspacecraft observations. The meandering of the magnetic field lines together\nwith the ion temperature homogenization along these lines are shown to be\nrelated to the strength of the turbulence, measured by the nonlinearity\nparameter. The results are interpreted in terms of a recently proposed\nphenomenological model where the homogenization process along field lines\ninduced by Landau damping plays a central role.\n", "  A new ionisation chamber for alpha-spectroscopy has been built from\nradio-pure materials for the purpose of investigating long lived alpha-decays.\nThe measurement makes use of pulse shape analysis to discriminate between\nsignal and background events. The design and performance of the chamber is\ndescribed in this paper. A background rate of ($10.9 \\pm 0.6$) counts per day\nin the energy region of 1 MeV to 9 MeV was achieved with a run period of 30.8\ndays. The background is dominantly produced by radon daughters.\n", "  Magnetic reconnection is a leading mechanism for dissipating magnetic energy\nand accelerating nonthermal particles in Poynting-flux dominated flows. In this\nletter, we investigate nonthermal particle acceleration during magnetic\nreconnection in a magnetically-dominated ion-electron plasma using fully\nkinetic simulations. For an ion-electron plasma with the total magnetization\n$\\sigma_0=B^2/(4\\pi n(m_i+m_e)c^2)$, the magnetization for each species is\n$\\sigma_i \\sim \\sigma_0$ and $\\sigma_e \\sim (m_i/m_e) \\sigma_0$, respectively.\nWe have studied the magnetically dominated regime by varying $\\sigma_{e} = 10^3\n- 10^5$ with initial ion and electron temperatures $T_i = T_e = 5 - 20 m_ec^2$\nand mass ratio $m_i/m_e = 1 - 1836$. The results demonstrate that reconnection\nquickly establishes power-law energy distributions for both electrons and ions\nwithin several ($2-3$) light-crossing times. For the cases with periodic\nboundary conditions, the power-law index is $1<s<2$ for both electrons and\nions. The hard spectra limit the power-law energies for electrons and ions to\nbe $\\gamma_{be} \\sim \\sigma_e$ and $\\gamma_{bi} \\sim \\sigma_i$, respectively.\nThe main acceleration mechanism is a Fermi-like acceleration through the drift\nmotions of charged particles. When comparing the spectra for electrons and ions\nin momentum space, the spectral indices $s_p$ are identical as predicted in\nFermi acceleration. We also find that the bulk flow can carry a significant\namount of energy during the simulations. We discuss the implication of this\nstudy in the context of Poynting-flux dominated jets and pulsar winds\nespecially the applications for explaining the nonthermal high-energy\nemissions.\n", "  We investigate matter couplings in massive bigravity. We find a new family of\nsuch consistent couplings, including and extending known consistent matter\ncouplings, and we investigate their decoupling limits, ADM decompositions,\nHiguchi bounds and further aspects. We show that differences to previous known\nconsistent couplings only arise beyond the $\\Lambda_3$ decoupling limit and\ndiscuss the uniqueness of consistent matter couplings and how this is related\nto the so-called symmetric vielbein condition. Since we work in a vielbein\nformulation, these results easily generalise to multi-gravity.\n", "  In d=2+1 dimensions, there exist field theories which are non-relativistic\nand superconformal. These theories describe two species of anyons, whose spins\ndiffer by 1/2, interacting in a harmonic trap. We compute the dimensions of\nchiral primary operators. These operators receive large anomalous dimensions\nwhich are related to the unusual angular momentum properties of anyons.\nSurprisingly, we find that the dimensions of some chiral primary operators\nviolate the unitarity bound and we trace this to the fact that the associated\nwavefunctions become non-normalisable. We also study BPS non-perturbative\nstates in this theory: these are Jackiw-Pi vortices. We show that these emerge\nat exactly the point where perturbative operators hit the unitarity bound. To\ndescribe the low-energy dynamics of these vortices, we construct a novel type\nof supersymmetric gauged linear sigma model.\n", "  The reionization of intergalactic hydrogen has received intense theoretical\nscrutiny over the past two decades. Here, we approach the process formally as a\npercolation process and phase transition. Using semi-numeric simulations, we\ndemonstrate that an infinitely-large ionized region abruptly appears at an\nionized fraction of ~0.1 and quickly grows to encompass most of the ionized\ngas: by an ionized fraction of 0.3, nearly ninety percent of the ionized\nmaterial is part of this region. Throughout most of reionization, nearly all of\nthe intergalactic medium is divided into just two regions, one ionized and one\nneutral, and both infinite in extent. We also show that the discrete ionized\nregions that exist before and near this transition point follow a near-power\nlaw distribution in volume, with equal contributions to the total filling\nfactor per logarithmic interval in size up to a sharp cutoff in volume. These\nqualities are generic to percolation processes, with the detailed behavior a\nresult of long-range correlations in the underlying density field. These\ninsights will be crucial to understanding the distribution of ionized and\nneutral gas during reionization and provide precise meaning to the intuitive\ndescription of reionization as an \"overlap\" process.\n", "  We review the recent results of heavy meson diffusion in thermal hadronic\nmatter. The interactions of D and B-bar mesons with other hadrons (light mesons\nand baryons) are extracted from effective field theories based on chiral and\nheavy-quark symmetries. When these guiding principles are combined with exact\nunitarity, physical values of the cross sections are obtained. These cross\nsections (which contain resonant contributions) are used to calculate the drag\nand diffusion coefficients of heavy mesons immersed in a thermal and dense\nmedium. The transport coefficients are computed using a Fokker-Planck reduction\nof the Boltzmann equation.\n", "  Current models of gamma-ray lightcurves in pulsars suffer from large\nuncertainties on the precise location of particle acceleration and radiation.\nHere, we present an attempt to alleviate these difficulties by solving for the\nelectromagnetic structure of the oblique magnetosphere, particle acceleration,\nand the emission of radiation self-consistently, using 3D spherical\nparticle-in-cell simulations. We find that the low-energy radiation is\nsynchro-curvature radiation from the polar-cap regions within the light\ncylinder. In contrast, the high-energy emission is synchrotron radiation that\noriginates exclusively from the Y-point and the equatorial current sheet where\nrelativistic magnetic reconnection accelerates particles. In most cases,\nsynthetic high-energy lightcurves contain two peaks that form when the current\nsheet sweeps across the observer's line of sight. We find clear evidence of\ncaustics in the emission pattern from the current sheet. High-obliquity\nsolutions can present up to two additional secondary peaks from energetic\nparticles in the wind region accelerated by the reconnection-induced flow near\nthe current sheet. The high-energy radiative efficiency depends sensitively on\nthe viewing angle, and decreases with increasing pulsar inclination. The\nhigh-energy emission is concentrated in the equatorial regions where most of\nthe pulsar spindown is released and dissipated. These results have important\nimplications for the interpretation of gamma-ray pulsar data.\n", "  Obscured active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are thought to be very common in the\nUniverse. Observations and surveys have shown that the number of sources\nincreases for near galaxies and at the low-luminosity regime (the so-called\nLLAGNs). Furthermore, many AGNs show changes in their obscuration properties at\nX-rays that may suggest a configuration of clouds very close to the accretion\ndisk. However, these variations could also be due to changes in the intrinsic\ncontinuum of the source. It is therefore important to study nearby AGN to\nbetter understand the locus and distribution of clouds in the neighbourhood of\nthe nucleus. We aim to study the nuclear obscuration of LLAGN NGC835 and its\nextended emission using mid-infrared observations. We present mid-infrared 11.5\nmicrons imaging of the LLAGN galaxy NGC835 obtained with the instrument\nCanariCam in the Gran Telescopio CANARIAS (GTC), archival Spitzer/IRS\nspectroscopy, and archival Chandra data observed in 2000, 2008, and 2013. The\nGTC/CanariCam 11.5 microns image reveals faint extended emission out to ~6\narcsec. We obtained a nuclear flux of F(11.5 microns) ~18 mJy, whereas the\nextended emission accounts for 90% of the total flux within the 6 arcsec. This\nmeans that the low angular resolution (~4 arcsec) IRS spectrum is dominated by\nthis extended emission and not by the AGN, clearly seen in the Spitzer/IRS\nspectrum. Although the extended soft X-ray emission shows some resemblance with\nthat of the mid-infrared, the knots seen at X-rays are mostly located in the\ninner side of this mid-infrared emission. The nuclear X-ray spectrum of the\nsource has undergone a spectral change between 2000/2008 and 2013. We argue\nthat this is most probably due to changes in the hydrogen column density from ~\n8x10E+23 cm-2 to ~ 3x10E+23 cm-2. NGC835 therefore is one of the few LLAGN,\ntogether with NGC1052, in which changes in the absorber can be claimed.\n", "  We examine the effects of higher-order multipole contributions of rotating\nneutron star (NS) spacetimes on the propagation of corrugation (c-)modes within\na thin accretion disk. We find that the Lense-Thirring precession frequency,\nwhich determines the propagation region of the low-frequency fundamental\ncorrugation modes, can experience a turnover allowing for c-modes to become\nself-trapped for sufficiently high dimensionless spin $j$ and quadrupole\nrotational deformability $\\alpha$. If such self-trapping c-modes can be\ndetected, e.g. through phase-resolved spectroscopy of the iron line for a\nhigh-spin low-mass accreting neutron star, this could potentially constrain the\nspin-induced NS quadrupole and the NS equation of state.\n", "  The progenitor systems for type Ia supernovae are still controversial. One of\nthe methods to test the proposed scenario for the progenitor systems is to\nidentify companions that are supposed to survive according to the so-called\nsingle degenerate scenario. These companions might be affected by supernova\nejecta. We present several numerical simulations of surviving red-giant\ncompanions whose envelopes were stripped and heated. We find that red-giants\nwith less-massive helium cores ($\\lesssim0.30\\,M_{\\odot}$) can be so faint\nafter the supernovae that we cannot detect them. In addition, we apply the\nresults to the case of SNR 0509-67.5, and put constraints on the helium core\nmass, envelope stripping, and energy injection under the single degenerate\nscenario for type Ia supernovae.\n", "  Simple elastic network models of DNA were developed to reveal the\nstructure-dynamics relationships for several nucleotide sequences. First, we\npropose a simple all-atom elastic network model of DNA that can explain the\nprofiles of temperature factors for several crystal structures of DNA. Second,\nwe propose a coarse-grained elastic network model of DNA, where each nucleotide\nis described only by one node. This model could effectively reproduce the\ndetailed dynamics obtained with the all-atom elastic network model according to\nthe sequence-dependent geometry. Through normal-mode analysis for the\ncoarse-grained elastic network model, we exhaustively analyzed the dynamic\nfeatures of a large number of long DNA sequences, approximately $\\sim 150$ bp\nin length. These analyses revealed positive correlations between the\nnucleosome-forming abilities and the inter-strand fluctuation strength of\ndouble-stranded DNA for several DNA sequences.\n", "  In this work, we present a few pieces of evidence in support of a possible\nconnection of the gravitational theory in dS space to the worldvolume theory of\nunstable D-branes. We show that the action describing the geodesic motion of a\nmassive particle (or point-like object) in static dS space turns out to be the\nsame as that of the tachyon field theory for an unstable particle. The motion\nalong the radial direction from the origin, a locally Minkowski spacetime, to\nthe horizon, a locally Rindler space times a sphere, represents just the\ntachyon condensation process, therefore providing a geometric picture of\ntachyon condensation. We further study a scalar in global or flat dS and the\ntachyon fluctuations in a homogeneous tachyon background, representing either\nthe full or half S-brane, on unstable D-branes and find that certain dynamics\nof the dS universe corresponds to that of the homogeneous full or half S-brane.\nThe thermal temperature of tachyon radiation is found to agree with that felt\nby any timelike observer in dS space. In string theory context, this\ntemperature is just the Hagedorn one, signaling a phase transition to closed\nstrings. An understanding of this transition in the bulk dS space is also\ngiven.\n", "  We present our studies on jet-induced modifications of the characteristic of\nthe bulk nuclear matter. To describe such a matter, we use efficient\nrelativistic hydrodynamic simulations in (3+1) dimensions employing the\nGraphics Processing Unit (GPU) in the parallel programming framework. We use\nCartesian coordinates in the calculations to ensure a high spatial resolution\nthat is constant throughout the evolution of the system. We show our results on\nhow jets modify the hydrodynamics fields and discuss the implications.\n", "  For a large class of mass-varying massive gravity models, the graviton mass\ncannot provide the late-time cosmic expansion of the universe due to its\nvanishing at late time. In this work, we propose a new class of mass-varying\nmassive gravity in which the graviton mass varies according to a kinetic term\nof a k-essence field. By using a more general form of the fiducial metric, we\nfound a solution such that a non-vanishing graviton mass can drive the\naccelerated expansion of the universe at late time. We also perform dynamical\nanalyses of such model and found that without introducing the k-essence\nLagrangian, the graviton mass can be responsible for both dark contents of the\nuniverse, namely dark energy that drives the accelerated expansion of the\nuniverse and non-relativistic matter that plays the role of dark matter.\nMoreover, by including the k-essence Lagrangian, we found that it is possible\nto alleviate the so-called cosmic coincidence problem.\n", "  We extend our earlier work on the minimal unitary representation of $SO(d,2)$\nand its deformations for $d=4,5$ and $6$ to arbitrary dimensions $d$. We show\nthat there is a one-to-one correspondence between the minrep of $SO(d,2)$ and\nits deformations and massless conformal fields in Minkowskian spacetimes in $d$\ndimensions. The minrep describes a massless conformal scalar field, and its\ndeformations describe massless conformal fields of higher spin. The generators\nof Joseph ideal vanish identically as operators for the quasiconformal\nrealization of the minrep, and its enveloping algebra yields directly the\nstandard bosonic $AdS_{(d+1)}/CFT_d$ higher spin algebra. For deformed minreps\nthe generators of certain deformations of Joseph ideal vanish as operators and\ntheir enveloping algebras lead to deformations of the standard bosonic higher\nspin algebra. In odd dimensions there is a unique deformation of the higher\nspin algebra corresponding to the spinor singleton. In even dimensions one\nfinds infinitely many deformations of the higher spin algebra labelled by the\neigenvalues of Casimir operator of the little group $SO(d-2)$ for massless\nrepresentations.\n", "  We explore the physics and observational consequences of tidal compression\nevents (TCEs) of dark-matter clumps (DMCs) by supermassive black holes (SMBHs).\nOur analytic calculations show that a DMC approaching a SMBH much closer than\nthe tidal radius undergoes significant compression along the axis perpendicular\nto the orbital plane, shortly after pericenter passage. For DMCs composed of\nself-annihilating dark-matter particles, we find that the boosted DMC density\nand velocity dispersion lead to a flaring of the annihilation rate, most\npronounced for a velocity- dependent annihilation cross section. If the end\nproducts of the annihilation are photons, this results in a gamma-ray flare,\ndetectable (and possibly already detected) by the Fermi telescope for a range\nof model parameters. If the end products of dark-matter annihilation are\nrelativistic electrons and positrons and the local magnetic field is large\nenough, TCEs of DMCs can lead to flares of synchrotron radiation. Finally, TCEs\nof DMCs lead to a burst of gravitational waves, in addition to the ones\nradiated by the orbital motion alone, and with a different frequency spectrum.\nThese transient phenomena provide interesting new avenues to explore the\nproperties of dark matter.\n", "  The ability to synthesis well-ordered two-dimensional materials under\nultra-high vacuum and directly characterize them by other techniques in-situ\ncan greatly advance our current understanding on their physical and chemical\nproperties. In this paper, we demonstrate that iso-oriented {\\alpha}-MoO3 films\nwith as low as single monolayer thickness can be reproducibly grown on\nSrTiO3(001) (STO) substrates by molecular beam epitaxy ( (010)MoO3 || (001)STO,\n[100]MoO3 || [100]STO or [010]STO) through a self-limiting process. While one\nin-plane lattice parameter of the MoO3 is very close to that of the SrTiO3\n(aMoO3 = 3.96 {\\AA}, aSTO = 3.905 {\\AA}), the lattice mismatch along other\ndirection is large (~5%, cMoO3 = 3.70 {\\AA}), which leads to relaxation as\nclearly observed from the splitting of streaks in reflection high-energy\nelectron diffraction (RHEED) patterns. A narrow range in the growth temperature\nis found to be optimal for the growth of monolayer {\\alpha}-MoO3 films.\nIncreasing deposition time will not lead to further increase in thickness,\nwhich is explained by a balance between deposition and thermal desorption due\nto the weak van der Waals force between {\\alpha}-MoO3 layers. Lowering growth\ntemperature after the initial iso-oriented {\\alpha}-MoO3 monolayer leads to\nthicker {\\alpha}-MoO3(010) films with excellent crystallinity.\n", "  Convection plays a central role in the dynamics of any stellar interior, and\nyet its operation remains largely-hidden from direct observation. As a result,\nmuch of our understanding concerning stellar convection necessarily derives\nfrom theoretical and computational models. The Sun is, however, exceptional in\nthat regard. The wealth of observational data afforded by its proximity\nprovides a unique testbed for comparing convection models against observations.\nWhen such comparisons are carried out, surprising inconsistencies between those\nmodels and observations become apparent. Both photospheric and helioseismic\nmeasurements suggest that convection simulations may overestimate convective\nflow speeds on large spatial scales. Moreover, many solar convection\nsimulations have difficulty reproducing the observed solar differential\nrotation due to this apparent overestimation. We present a series of\n3-dimensional (3-D) stellar convection simulations designed to examine how the\namplitude and spectral distribution of convective flows are established within\na star's interior. While these simulations are non-magnetic and non-rotating in\nnature, they demonstrate two robust phenomena. When run with sufficiently high\nRayleigh number, the integrated kinetic energy of the convection becomes\neffectively independent of thermal diffusion, but the spectral distribution of\nthat kinetic energy remains sensitive to both of these quantities. A simulation\nthat has converged to a diffusion-independent value of kinetic energy will\ndivide that energy between spatial scales such that low-wavenumber power is\noverestimated, and high-wavenumber power is underestimated relative to a\ncomparable system possessing higher Rayleigh number. We discuss the\nimplications of these results in light of the current inconsistencies between\nmodels and observations.\n", "  Nonlinear Kronig-Penney model has been frequently employed to study\ntransmission problem of electron wave in a nonlinear electrified chain or in a\ndoped semiconductor superlattice. Here from an integral equation we derive a\nnovel exact solution of the problem, which contains a simple nonlinear map\nconnecting transmission coefficient with system parameters. Consequently, we\nsuggest a scheme for manipulating electronic distribution and transmission by\nadjusting the system parameters. A new effect of quantum coherence is evidenced\nin the strict expression of transmission coefficient by which for some\ndifferent system parameters we obtain the similar aperiodic distributions and\narbitrary transmission coefficients including the approximate zero transmission\nand total transmission, and the multiple transmissions. The method based on the\nconcise exact solution can be applied directly to some nonlinear cold atomic\nsystems and a lot of linear Kronig-Penney systems, and also can be extended to\ninvestigate electron transport in different discrete nonlinear systems.\n", "  We put forward the idea that the quark-gluon plasma might exist way below the\nusual confinement temperature $T_c$. Our argument rests on the possibility that\nthe plasma produced in heavy-ion collisions could reach a transient\nquasi-equilibrium with `over-occupied' gluon density, as advocated by Blaizot\net al. Taking further into account that gluons acquire an effective mass by\ninteraction effects, they can have a positive chemical potential and therefore\nbehave similarly to non-relativistic bosons. Relevant properties of this dense\nstate of interacting gluons, which we dub serried glue, can then be inferred on\nrather general grounds from Maxwell's relation.\n", "  A class of graphene wound into three-dimensional periodic curved surfaces\n(\"graphitic zeolites\") is proposed and their electronic structures are obtained\nto explore how the massless Dirac fermions behave on periodic surfaces. We find\nin the tight-binding model that the low-energy band structure around the charge\nneutrality point is dominated by the topology (cubic or gyroid) of the periodic\nsurface as well as by the spatial period $L$ in modulo 3 in units of the\nlattice constant. In both of cubic and gyroid cases the Dirac electrons become\nmassive around the charge neutrality point, where the band gap is shown to\nscale as $1/L$ within each mod-3 class. Wave functions around the gap are found\nto have amplitudes sharply peaked around the topological defects that are\nrequired to deform the graphene sheet into a three-dimensional periodic\nsurface, and this is shown to originate from non-trivial Bloch phases at $K$\nand $K'$ points of the original graphene.\n", "  We investigate the absorption of a massive and charged scalar field in a\nReissner-Nordstr\\\"om background. We compare our numerical results for the\nabsorption cross section, obtained for arbitrary frequencies, with the low- and\nhigh-frequency limits. We find, in particular, that the total absorption cross\nsection can be negative, showing that planar scalar waves can be superradiantly\namplified by black holes.\n", "  Using holography, we study non-perturbative effects in M-theory on\norientifolds from the analysis of the S^3 partition functions of dual field\ntheories. We consider the S^3 partition functions of N=4 Yang-Mills theory with\nO(n) gauge symmetry coupled to one (anti)symmetric and N_f fundamental\nhypermultiplets from the Fermi gas approach. In addition to the worldsheet\ninstanton and membrane instanton corrections to the grand potential, which are\nalso present in the U(n) Yang-Mills case, we find that there exist \"half\ninstanton\" corrections coming from the effect of orientifold plane.\n", "  ReS$_2$ has recently emerged as a new member in the rapidly growing family of\ntwo-dimensional materials. Unlike MoS$_2$ or WSe$_2$, the optical and\nelectrical properties of ReS$_2$ are not isotropic due to the reduced symmetry\nof the crystal. Here, we present layer-dependent Raman measurements of ReS$_2$\nsamples ranging from monolayers to ten layers in the ultralow frequency regime.\nWe observe layer breathing and shear modes which allow for easy assignment of\nthe number of layers. Polarization-dependent measurements give further insight\ninto the crystal structure and reveal an energetic shift of the shear mode\nwhich stems from the in-plane anisotropy of the shear modulus in this material.\n", "  We performed axisymmetric hydrodynamical simulations of oscillating tori\norbiting a non-rotating black hole. The tori in equilibrium were constructed\nwith a constant distribution of angular momentum in a pseudo-Newtonian\npotential (Klu{\\'z}niak-Lee). Motions of the torus were triggered by adding\nsub-sonic velocity fields: radial, vertical and diagonal to the tori in\nequilibrium. As the perturbed tori evolved in time, we measured $L_{2}$ norm of\ndensity and obtained the power spectrum of $L_{2}$ norm which manifested\neigenfrequencies of tori modes. The most prominent modes of oscillation excited\nin the torus by a quasi-random perturbation are the breathing mode and the\nradial and vertical epicyclic modes. The radial and the plus modes, as well as\nthe vertical and the breathing modes will have frequencies in an approximate\n3:2 ratio if the torus is several Schwarzschild radii away from the innermost\nstable circular orbit. Results of our simulations may be of interest in the\ncontext of high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (HF QPOs) observed in\nstellar-mass black hole binaries, as well as in supermassive black holes.\n", "  Entanglement is a physical phenomenon that each state cannot be described\nindividually. Entanglement entropy gives quantitative understanding to the\nentanglement. We use decomposition of the Hilbert space to discuss properties\nof the entanglement. Therefore, partial trace operator becomes important to\ndefine the reduced density matrix from different centers, which commutes with\nall elements in the Hilbert space, corresponding to different entanglement\nchoices or different observations on entangling surface. Entanglement entropy\nis expected to satisfy the strong subadditivity. We discuss decomposition of\nthe Hilbert space for the strong subadditivity and other related inequalities.\nThe entanglement entropy with centers can be computed from the Hamitonian\nformulations systematically, provided that we know wavefunctional. In the\nHamitonian formulation, it is easier to obtain symmetry structure. We consider\nmassless $p$-form theory as an example. The massless $p$-form theory in\n($2p+2)$-dimensions has global symmetry, similar to the electric-magnetic\nduality, connecting centers in ground state. This defines a duality structure\nin centers. Because it is hard to exactly compute the entanglement entropy from\npartial trace operator, we propose the Lagrangian formulation from the\nHamitonian formulation to compute the entanglement entropy with centers. From\nthe Lagrangian method and saddle point approximation, the codimension two\nsurface term (leading order) in the Einstein gravity theory or holographic\nentanglement entropy should correspond to non-tensor product decomposition\n(center is not identity). Finally, we compute the entanglement entropy of the\n$SU(N)$ Yang-Mills lattice gauge theory in the fundamental representation using\nthe strong coupling expansion in the extended lattice model to obtain spatial\narea term in total dimensions larger than two for $N>1$.\n", "  Domain walls in magnetic multilayered systems can exhibit a very complex and\nfascinating behavior. For example, the magnetization of thin films of hard\nmagnetic materials is in general perpendicular to the thin-film plane, thanks\nto the strong out-of-plane anisotropy, but its direction changes periodically,\nforming an alternating spin-up and spin-down stripe pattern. The latter is\nstabilized by the competition between the ferromagnetic coupling and\ndipole-dipole interactions, and disappears when a moderate in-plane magnetic\nfield is applied. It has been suggested that such a behavior may be understood\nin terms of a self-induced stripe glassiness. In this paper we show that such a\nscenario is compatible with the experimental findings. The strong out-of-plane\nmagnetic anisotropy of the film is found to be beneficial for the formation of\nboth the stripe-ordered and glassy phases. At zero magnetic field the system\ncan form a glass only in a narrow interval of fairly large temperatures. An\nin-plane magnetic field, however, shifts the glass transition towards lower\ntemperatures, therefore enabling it at or below room temperature. In good\nqualitative agreement with the experimental findings, we show that a moderate\nin-plane magnetic field of the order of $30~{\\rm mT}$ can lead to the formation\nof defects in the stripe pattern, which sets the onset of the glass transition.\n", "  It has been known since decades that imposing a symmetry group G on the\nscalar sector of multi-Higgs-doublet models has consequences for CP-violation.\nIn all examples of two- and three-Higgs-doublet models equipped with\nsymmetries, one observes the following intriguing property: if G prevents\nexplicit CP-violation (CPV), at least in the neutral Higgs sector, then it also\nprevents spontaneous CPV, and if G allows explicit CPV, then it allows for\nspontaneous CPV. One is led to conjecture that this is a general phenomenon. In\nthis paper, we prove this conjecture for any rephasing symmetry group G and any\nnumber of doublets.\n", "  The recent discovery of the first Weyl semimetal in TaAs provides the first\nobservation of a Weyl fermion in nature. Such a topological semimetal features\na novel type of anomalous surface state, the Fermi arc, which connects a pair\nof Weyl nodes through the boundary of the crystal. Here, we present theoretical\ncalculations of the quasi-particle interference (QPI) patterns that arise from\nthe surface states including the topological Fermi arcs in the Weyl semimetals\nTaAs and NbP. Most importantly, we discover that the QPI exhibits\ntermination-points that are fingerprints of the Weyl nodes in the interference\npattern. Our results, for the first time, propose an interference signature of\nthe topological Fermi arcs in TaAs, which provides important guidelines for STM\nmeasurements on this prototypical Weyl semimetal compound. The scattering\nchannels presented here is relevant to transport phenomena on the surface of\nthe TaAs class of Weyl semimetals. Our work is also the first systematic\ncalculation of the quantum interferences from the Fermi arc surface states,\nwhich is in general useful for future STM studies on other Weyl semimetals.\n", "  Capitalizing on the all-sky coverage of {\\it WISE}, and the 35\\% and 50\\% sky\ncoverage from SDSS and Pan-STARRS, respectively, we explore the efficacy of\n$m_{R}$ (optical) - $m_{3.4 \\mu m}$ (mid-infrared), hereafter $R-W1$, as a\ncolor diagnostic to identify obscured supermassive black hole accretion in\nwide-area X-ray surveys. We use the $\\sim$16.5 deg$^2$ Stripe 82 X-ray survey\ndata as a test-bed to compare $R-W1$ with $R-K$, an oft-used obscured AGN\nselection criterion, and examine where different classes of objects lie in this\nparameter space. Most stars follow a well-defined path in $R-K$ vs. $R-W1$\nspace. We demonstrate that optically normal galaxies hosting X-ray AGN at\nredshifts $0.5<z<1$ can be recovered with an $R-W1>4$ color-cut, while they\ntypically are not selected as AGN based on their $W1-W2$ colors. Additionally,\ndifferent observed X-ray luminosity bins favor different regions in $R-W1$\nparameter space: moderate luminosity AGN ($10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1} < L_{\\rm 0.5-10\nkeV} < 10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$) tend to have red colors while the highest\nluminosity AGN ($L_{\\rm 0.5-10 keV} > 10^{45}$ erg s$^{-1}$) have bluer colors;\nhigher spectroscopic completeness of the Stripe 82X sample is needed to\ndetermine whether this is a selection effect or an intrinsic property. Finally,\nwe parameterize X-ray obscuration of Stripe 82X AGN by calculating their\nhardness ratios (HRs) and find no clear trends between HR and optical\nreddening. Our results will help inform best-effort practices in following-up\nobscured AGN candidates in current and future wide-area, shallow X-ray surveys,\nincluding the all-sky {\\it eROSITA} mission.\n", "  To test the role of large-scale magnetic fields in accretion processes, we\nstudy dynamics of charged test particles in vicinity of a black hole immersed\ninto an asymptotically uniform magnetic field. Using the Hamiltonian formalism\nof charged particle dynamics, we examine chaotic scattering in the effective\npotential related to the black hole gravitational field combined with the\nuniform magnetic field. Energy interchange between the translational and\noscillatory modes od the charged particle dynamics provides mechanism for\ncharged particle acceleration along the magnetic field lines. This energy\ntransmutation is an attribute of the chaotic charged particle dynamics in the\ncombined gravitational and magnetic fields only, the black hole rotation is not\nnecessary for such charged particle acceleration. The chaotic scatter can cause\ntransition to the motion along the magnetic field lines with small radius of\nthe Larmor motion or vanishing Larmor radius, when the speed of the particle\ntranslational motion is largest and can be ultra-relativistic. We discuss\nconsequences of the model of ionization of test particles forming a neutral\naccretion disc, or heavy ions following off-equatorial circular orbits, and we\nexplore the fate of heavy charged test particles after ionization where no kick\nof heavy ions is assumed and only switch-on effect of the magnetic field is\nrelevant. We demonstrate that acceleration and escape of the ionized particles\ncan be efficient along the Kerr black hole symmetry axis parallel to the\nmagnetic field lines. We show that strong acceleration of ionized particles to\nultra-relativistic velocities is preferred in the direction close to the\nmagnetic field lines. Therefore, the process of ionization of Keplerian discs\naround Kerr black holes can serve as a model of relativistic jets.\n", "  The dynamics of a quantum system with internal degrees of freedom undergoing\nspontaneous collapse in the position basis are analysed; e.g., neutral mesons\nor neutrinos. Surprisingly, the value of the Heaviside function $\\theta(x)$ at\n$x=0$ that can in general be chosen in the interval [0,1] leads to different\nphysical predictions. For the QMUPL (Quantum Mechanics with Universal Position\nLocalization) model only a single value leads to probabilities conserving the\nparticle number. Herewith the physical properties of the noise field can be\nconstrained. This opens a road to study the physical properties of the noise\nfield essential for collapse models.\n", "  Circumbinary planets whose orbits become unstable may be ejected, accreted,\nor even captured by one of the stars. We quantify the relative rates of these\nchannels, for a binary of secondary star's mass fraction 0.1 with an orbit of\n1AU. The most common outcome is ejection, which happens ~80% of the time. If\nbinary systems form circumbinary planets readily and sloppily, this process may\nfill the Milky Way with free-floating planets. A significant fraction of the\ntime, ~20%, the unstable planet strikes the primary or secondary. We tracked\nwhether a Jupiter-like planet would undergo tidal stripping events during close\npassages, and find that these events are not strong enough to change the\ntrajectory of the planet, though this may be observable from a changed\nstructured for free-floating planets that are produced by this process.\n", "  Recent experimental results from the LHCb, BaBar and Belle collaborations on\nthe semitauonic decays of $B$ meson, $\\bar{B}\\rightarrow D^{(\\ast)}\\tau\n\\bar{\\nu}$, showing a significant deviation from the Standard Model (SM), hint\ntowards a new physics scenario beyond the SM. In this work, we show that these\nenhanced decay rates can be explained within the framework of $E_{6}$ motivated\nAlternative Left-Right Symmetric Model (ALRSM), which has been successful in\nexplaining the recent CMS excesses and has the feature of accommodating high\nscale leptogenesis. The R-parity conserving couplings in ALRSM can contribute\nuniversally to both $\\bar{B}\\rightarrow D \\tau \\bar{\\nu}$ and\n$\\bar{B}\\rightarrow D^{(\\ast)}\\tau \\bar{\\nu}$ via the exchange of scalar\nleptoquarks. We study the leptonic decays $D_{s}^{+} \\rightarrow \\tau^{+}\n\\bar{\\nu}$, $B^{+}\\rightarrow \\tau^{+} \\bar{\\nu}$, $D^{+}\\rightarrow \\tau^{+}\n\\bar{\\nu}$ and $D^{0}$-$\\bar{D}^{0}$ mixing to constrain the couplings involved\nin explaining the enhanced $B$ decay rates and we find that ALRSM can explain\nthe current experimental data on $\\mathcal{R}(D^{(\\ast)})$ quite well while\nsatisfying these constraints.\n", "  Tapered silica fibers are often used to rapidly probe the optical properties\nof micro-resonators. However, their low refractive index precludes\nphase-matching when coupling to high-index micro-resonators, reducing\nefficiency. Here we demonstrate efficient optical coupling from tapered fibers\nto high-index micro-resonators by loading the fibers with an ancillary\nadiabatic waveguide-coupler fabricated via angled-etching. We demonstrate\ngreatly enhanced coupling to a silicon multimode micro-resonator when compared\nto coupling via the bare fiber only. Signatures of resonator optical\nbistability are observed at high powers. This scheme can be applied to\nresonators of any size and material, increasing the functional scope of fiber\ncoupling.\n", "  We generalize the classical one dimensional Potts model to the case where the\nsymmetry group is a non-Abelian finite group. It turns out that this new model\nhas a quantum nature in that its spectrum of energy eigenstates consists of\nentangled states. We determine the complete energy spectrum, i.e. the ground\nstates and all the excited states with their degeneracy structure. We calculate\nthe partition function by two different algebraic and combinatorial methods. We\nalso determine the entanglement properties of its ground states.\n", "  We have observed 6 late-L and T dwarfs with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large\nArray (VLA) to investigate the presence of highly circularly polarized radio\nemission, associated with large-scale auroral currents. Previous surveys\nencompassing ~60 L6 or later targets in this spectral range have yielded only\none detection. Our sample includes the previously detected T6.5 dwarf 2MASS\n10475385+2124234 as well as 5 new targets selected for the presence of H-alpha\nemission or optical/infrared photometric variability, which are possible\nmanifestations of auroral activity. We detect 2MASS 10475385+2124234, as well\nas 4 of the 5 targets in our biased sample, including the strong IR variable\nSIMP J01365662+0933473 and bright H-alpha emitter 2MASS 12373919+6526148,\nreinforcing the possibility that activity at these disparate wavelengths is\nrelated. The radio emission frequency corresponds to a precise determination of\nthe lower-bound magnetic field strength near the surface of each dwarf and this\nnew sample provides robust constraints on dynamo theory in the low mass brown\ndwarf regime. Magnetic fields >2.5 kG are confirmed for 5/6 targets. Our\nresults provide tentative evidence that the dynamo operating in this mass\nregime may be inconsistent with predicted values from a recently proposed\nmodel. Further observations at higher radio frequencies are essential for\nverifying this assertion.\n", "  We construct a class of Einstein-vector theories where the vector field\ncouples bilinearly to the curvature polynomials of arbitrary order in such a\nway that only Riemann tensor rather than its derivative enters the equations of\nmotion. The theories can thus be ghost free. The U(1) gauge symmetry may emerge\nin the vacuum and also in some weak-field limit. We focus on the two-derivative\ntheory and study a variety of applications. We find that in this theory, the\nenergy-momentum tensor of dark matter provides a position-dependent\ngauge-violating term to the Maxwell field. We also use the vector as an\ninflaton and construct cosmological solutions. We find that the expansion can\naccelerate without a bared cosmological constant, indicating a new candidate\nfor dark energy. Furthermore we obtain exact solutions of de Sitter bounce,\ngenerated by the vector which behaves like a Maxwell field in the later time.\nWe also obtain a few new exact black holes that are asymptotic to flat and\nLifshitz spacetimes. In addition, we construct exact wormholes, and\nRandall-Sundrum II domain walls.\n", "  Quasi-two dimensional superconductors with sufficiently weak interlayer\ncoupling allow magnetic flux to penetrate in the form of Josephson vortices for\nin-plane applied magnetic fields. A consequence is the dominance of the Zeeman\ninteraction over orbital effects. In the clean limit, the normal state is\nfavored over superconductivity for fields greater than the paramagnetic\nlimiting field, unless an intermediate, inhomogeneous state is stabilized.\nPresented here are nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies of the\ninhomogeneous (FFLO) state for $\\beta^{\\prime\n\\prime}$-(ET)$_2$SF$_5$CH$_2$CF$_2$SO$_3$. The uniform superconductivity-FFLO\ntransition is identified at an applied field value of 9.3(0.1) T at low\ntemperature ($T=130$ mK), and evidence for a possible second transition between\ninhomogeneous states at $\\sim11$ T is presented. The spin polarization\ndistribution inferred from the NMR absorption spectrum compares favorably to a\nsingle-Q modulation of the superconducting order parameter.\n", "  We investigated the effects of Se substitution on the lattice constants and\nsuperconducting properties of CeO0.5F0.5Bi(S1-xSex)2. With increasing Se\nconcentration, the a lattice constant increased, while the c lattice constant\ndid not show any significant increase between x = 0.1 and x = 0.5. Bulk\nsuperconductivity was observed in samples with x = 0.2-0.4, and the\nsuperconducting transition temperature was the highest at x = 0.3. The obtained\nsuperconductivity phase diagram was compared to those of LaO0.5F0.5Bi(S1-xSex)2\nand NdO0.5F0.5Bi(S1-xSex)2.\n", "  Inspired by recent experiments and simulations on pattern formation in\nbiomolecules by optical tweezers, a theoretical description based on reference\ninteraction site model (RISM) integral equation method is developed to\ncalculate the equilibrium density profiles of small polyelectrolytes in an\nexternal potential. The formalism is applied to the specific case of a finite\nnumber of polyelectrolytes trapped in a harmonic potential. The density\nprofiles of flexible Gaussian and rigid rod-like polyelectrolytes are studied\nover a range of lengths and numbers of polyelectrolytes in the trap and the\nCoulomb coupling parameter. For smaller polymers we recover the results for\npoint charges. In the mean field limit the point particles do not form shells\nfor any values of the coupling parameter whereas the longer polymers form a\nshell at the boundary at moderate coupling. When the inter-polymer cor-\nrelations are included the density profile of the polymers shows sharp shells\neven at weak coupling. The implications of these results are also discussed.\n", "  We consider ${\\cal N} =1$ supersymmetric gauge theories in the conformal\nwindow. The running of the gauge coupling is absorbed into the metric by\napplying a suitable matter superfield- and Weyl-transformation. The computation\nbecomes equivalent to one of a free theory in a curved background carrying the\ninformation of the renormalisation group flow. We use the techniques of\nconformal anomaly matching and dilaton effective action, by Komargodski and\nSchwimmer, to rederive the difference of the Euler anomaly coefficient $\\Delta\na \\equiv a_{\\rm UV} - a_{\\rm IR} $ for the ${\\cal N} =1$ theory. The structure\nof $\\Delta a $ is therefore in one-to-one correspondence with the Wess-Zumino\ndilaton action.\n", "  We report on the construction and initial performance studies of two\nmicromegas detector quadruplets with an area of 0.5 m$^2$. They serve as\nprototypes for the planned upgrade project of the ATLAS muon system. Their\ndesign is based on the resistive-strip technology and thus renders the\ndetectors spark tolerant. Each quadruplet comprises four detection layers with\n1024 readout strips and a strip pitch of 415 $\\mu$m. In two out of the four\nlayers the strips are inclined by $\\pm$1.5$^{\\circ}$ to allow for the\nmeasurement of a second coordinate. We present the detector concept and report\non the experience gained during the detector construction. In addition an\nevaluation of the detector performance with cosmic rays and test-beam data is\ngiven.\n", "  We derive exact brane solutions of minimally coupled Einstein-Maxwell-scalar\ngravity in d+2 dimensions with a vanishing scalar potential. The solutions are\nconformal to the Lifshitz spacetime and have several properties, which make\nthem interesting for holographic applications. In particular, the dual QFT is\ncharacterized by hyperscaling violation. We show that our solutions, together\nwith the AdS brane and the domain wall sourced by an exponential potential,\ngive the complete list of scalar branes sourced by a generic potential having\nsimple (scale-covariant) scaling symmetries. This allows us to give a complete\nclassification of both simple and interpolating brane solution of minimally\ncoupled Einstein-Maxwell-scalar gravity, which may be very useful for\nholographic applications.\n", "  We define here q-Gamow states corresponding to Tsallis' q-statistics. We\ncompute for them their norm, mean energy value an the q-analogue of the\nBreit-Wigner distribution (a q-Breit-Wigner).\n", "  We investigated the origin of the high reverse leakage current in light\nemitting diodes (LEDs) based on (In,Ga)N/GaN nanowire (NW) ensembles grown by\nmolecular beam epitaxy on Si substrates. To this end, capacitance deep level\ntransient spectroscopy (DLTS) and temperature-dependent current-voltage (I-V)\nmeasurements were performed on a fully processed NW-LED. The DLTS measurements\nreveal the presence of two distinct electron traps with high concentrations in\nthe depletion region of the p-i-n junction. These band gap states are located\nat energies of $570\\pm20$ and $840\\pm30$ meV below the conduction band minimum.\nThe physical origin of these deep level states is discussed. The\ntemperature-dependent I-V characteristics, acquired between 83 and 403 K, show\nthat different conduction mechanisms cause the observed leakage current. On the\nbasis of all these results, we developed a quantitative physical model for\ncharge transport in the reverse bias regime. By taking into account the mutual\ninteraction of variable range hopping and electron emission from Coulombic trap\nstates, with the latter being described by phonon-assisted tunnelling and the\nPoole-Frenkel effect, we can model the experimental I-V curves in the entire\nrange of temperatures with a consistent set of parameters. Our model should be\napplicable to planar GaN-based LEDs as well. Furthermore, possible approaches\nto decrease the leakage current in NW-LEDs are proposed.\n", "  GJ758 B is a brown dwarf companion to a nearby (15.76 pc) solar-type,\nmetal-rich (M/H = +0.2 dex) main-sequence star (G9V) that was discovered with\nSubaru/HiCIAO in 2009. From previous studies, it has drawn attention as being\nthe coldest (~600K) companion ever directly imaged around a neighboring star.\nWe present new high-contrast data obtained during the commissioning of the\nSPHERE instrument at the VLT. The data was obtained in Y-, J-, H-, and Ks-bands\nwith the dual-band imaging (DBI) mode of IRDIS, providing a broad coverage of\nthe full near-infrared (near-IR) range at higher contrast and better spectral\nsampling than previously reported. In this new set of high-quality data, we\nreport the re-detection of the companion, as well as the first detection of a\nnew candidate closer-in to the star. We use the new 8 photometric points for an\nextended comparison of GJ758 B with empirical objects and 4 families of\natmospheric models. From comparison to empirical object, we estimate a T8\nspectral type, but none of the comparison object can accurately represent the\nobserved near-IR fluxes of GJ758 B. From comparison to atmospheric models, we\nattribute a Teff = 600K $\\pm$ 100K, but we find that no atmospheric model can\nadequately fit all the fluxes of GJ758 B. The photometry of the new candidate\ncompanion is broadly consistent with L-type objects, but a second epoch with\nimproved photometry is necessary to clarify its status. The new astrometry of\nGJ758 B shows a significant proper motion since the last epoch. We use this\nresult to improve the determination of the orbital characteristics using two\nfitting approaches, Least-Square Monte Carlo and Markov Chain Monte Carlo.\nFinally, we analyze the sensitivity of our data to additional closer-in\ncompanions and reject the possibility of other massive brown dwarf companions\ndown to 4-5 AU. [abridged]\n", "  The system of four planets around HR8799 offers a unique opportunity to probe\nthe physics and chemistry at play in the atmospheres of self-luminous young\n(~30 Myr) planets. We recently obtained new photometry of the four planets and\nlow-resolution (R~30) spectra of HR8799 d and e with the SPHERE instrument\n(paper III). In this paper (paper IV), we compare the available spectra and\nphotometry of the planets to known objects and atmospheric models (BT-SETTL14,\nCloud-AE60, Exo-REM) to characterize the atmospheric properties of the planets.\nWe find that HR8799d and e properties are well reproduced by those of L6-L8\ndusty dwarfs discovered in the field, among which some are candidate members of\nyoung nearby associations. No known object reproduces well the properties of\nplanets b and c. Nevertheless, we find that the spectra and WISE photometry of\npeculiar and/or young early-T dwarfs reddened by submicron grains made of\ncorundum, iron, enstatite, or forsterite successfully reproduce the SED of\nthese two planets. Our analysis confirms that only the Exo-REM models with\nthick clouds fit (within 2{\\sigma}) the whole set of spectrophotometric\ndatapoints available for HR8799 d and e for Teff = 1200 K, log g in the range\n3.0-4.5, and M/H=+0.5. The models still fail to reproduce the SED of HR8799c\nand b. The determination of the metallicity, log g, and cloud thickness are\ndegenerate. We conclude that an enhanced content in dust and decreased CIA of\nH2 is certainly responsible for the deviation of the properties of the planet\nwith respect to field dwarfs. The analysis suggests in addition that HR8799c\nand b have later spectral types than the two other planets, and therefore could\nboth have lower masses.\n", "  Mechanical impulse propagation in granular media depends strongly on the\nimposed confinement conditions. In this work, the propagation of sound in a\ngranular packing contained by flexible walls that enable confinement under\nhydrostatic pressure conditions is investigated. This configuration also allows\nthe form of the input impulse to be controlled by means of an instrumented\nimpact pendulum. The main characteristics of mechan- ical wave propagation are\nanalyzed, and it is found that the wave speed as function of the wave amplitude\nof the propagating pulse obeys the predictions of the Hertz contact law. Upon\nincreasing the confinement pressure, a continuous transition from nonlinear to\nlinear propagation is observed. Our results show that in the low-confinement\nregime, the attenuation increases with an increasing impulse amplitude for\nnonlinear pulses, whereas it is a weak function of the confinement pressure for\nlinear waves.\n", "  We present the results of the SDSS APOGEE INfrared Spectroscopy of Young\nNebulous Clusters program (IN-SYNC) survey of the Orion A molecular cloud. This\nsurvey obtained high resolution near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy of about 2700\nyoung pre-main sequence stars throughout the region, acquired across five\ndistinct fields spanning 6deg field of view (FOV). With these spectra, we have\nmeasured accurate stellar parameters (T_eff, log g, v sin i) and extinctions,\nand placed the sources in the Hertzsprung-Russel Diagram (HRD). We have also\nextracted radial velocities for the kinematic characterization of the\npopulation. We compare our measurements with literature results for a\nsub-sample of targets in order to assess the performances and accuracy of the\nsurvey. Source extinction shows evidence for dust grains that are larger than\nthose in the diffuse interstellar medium (ISM): we estimate an average R_V=5.5\nin the region. Importantly, we find a clear correlation between HRD inferred\nages and spectroscopic surface-gravity inferred ages. This clearly indicates a\nreal spread of stellar radii at fixed temperature, and together with additional\ncorrelations with extinction and with disk presence, strongly suggests a real\nspread of ages large than a few Myr. Focussing on the young population around\nNGC1980 iota Ori, which has previously been suggested to be a separate,\nforeground, older cluster, we confirm its older (5Myr) age and low A_V, but\nconsidering that its radial velocity distribution is indistinguishable from the\nOrion A's population, we suggest that NGC1980 is part of Orion A's star\nformation activity. Based on their stellar parameters and kinematic properties,\nwe identify 383 new candidate members of Orion A, most of which are diskless\nsources in areas of the region poorly studied by previous works.\n", "  [abbreviated] We present a census of Ly\\alpha\\ emission at $z\\gtrsim7$\nutilizing deep near infrared HST grism spectroscopy from the first six\ncompleted clusters of the Grism Lens-Amplified Survey from Space (GLASS). In\n24/159 photometrically selected galaxies we detect emission lines consistent\nwith Ly\\alpha\\ in the GLASS spectra. Based on the distribution of\nsignal-to-noise ratios and on simulations we expect the completeness and the\npurity of the sample to be 40-100% and 60-90%, respectively. For the objects\nwithout detected emission lines we show that the observed (not corrected for\nlensing magnification) 1$\\sigma$ flux limits reaches\n$5\\times10^{-18}$erg/s/cm$^{2}$ per position angle over the full wavelength\nrange of GLASS (0.8-1.7$\\mu$m). Based on the conditional probability of\nLy\\alpha\\ emission measured from the ground at $z\\sim7$ we would have expected\n12-18 Ly\\alpha\\ emitters. This is consistent with the number of detections,\nwithin the uncertainties, confirming the drop in Ly\\alpha\\ emission with\nrespect to $z\\sim6$. These candidates include a promising source at $z=8.1$.\nThe spatial extent of Ly\\alpha\\ in a deep stack of the most convincing\nLy\\alpha\\ emitters with $\\langle z\\rangle=7.2$ is consistent with that of the\nrest-frame UV continuum. Extended Ly$\\alpha$ emission, if present, has a\nsurface brightness below our detection limit, consistent with the properties of\nlower redshift comparison samples. From the stack we estimate upper limits on\nrest-frame UV emission line ratios and find $f_\\textrm{CIV} /\nf_\\textrm{Ly${\\alpha}$} \\lesssim 0.32$ and $f_\\textrm{CIII]} /\nf_\\textrm{Ly$\\alpha$} \\lesssim 0.23$ in good agreement with other values\npublished in the literature.\n", "  We elaborate on a recent study of a model of supersymmetry breaking we\nproposed recently, in the presence of a tunable positive cosmological constant,\nbased on a gauged shift symmetry of a string modulus, external to the Standard\nModel (SM) sector. Here, we identify this symmetry with a global symmetry of\nthe SM and work out the corresponding phenomenology. A particularly attracting\npossibility is to use a combination of Baryon and Lepton number that contains\nthe known matter parity and guarantees absence of dimension-four and five\noperators that violate B and L.\n", "  We present a complete analysis of the light rays within the linearized,\nweak-field approximation of a Schwarzschild-like metric describing the\ngravitational field of an isolated, spherically symmetric body. We prove in\nthis context the existence of two time transfer functions and we obtain these\nfunctions in an exact closed-form. We are led to distinguish two regimes. In\nthe first regime, the two time transfer functions correspond to rays which are\nconfined in regions of spacetime where the weak-field approximation is valid.\nSuch a regime occurs in gravitational lensing configurations with double images\nof a given source. We find the general expressions of the angular separation\nand the difference in light travel time between the two images. In the second\nregime, there exists only one time transfer function corresponding to a light\nray remaining in a region of weak field. Performing a Taylor expansion of this\nfunction with respect to the gravitational constant, we obtain the Shapiro time\ndelay completed by a series of so-called \"enhanced terms\". The enhanced terms\nbeyond the third order are new.\n", "  We show that the known expressions for the force on a point-like dipole are\nincompatible with the relativistic transformation of force, and in this respect\nwe apply the Lagrangian approach to the derivation of the correct equation for\nforce on a small electric/magnetic dipole. The obtained expression for the\ngeneralized momentum of a moving dipole predicts two novel quantum effects with\nnon-topological and non-dynamic phases, when an electric dipole is moving in an\nelectric field, and when a magnetic dipole is moving in a magnetic field,\ncorrespondingly. The implications of the obtained results are discussed.\n", "  A quantitative analysis of the evolution of nuclear shapes and shape phase\ntransitions, including regions of short-lived nuclei that are becoming\naccessible in experiments at radioactive-beam facilities, necessitate accurate\nmodeling of the underlying nucleonic dynamics. Important theoretical advances\nhave recently been made in studies of complex shapes and the corresponding\nexcitation spectra and electromagnetic decay patterns, especially in the\n\"beyond mean-field\" framework based on nuclear density functionals. Interesting\napplications include studies of shape evolution and coexistence in N = 28\nisotones, the structure of lowest $0^+$ excitations in deformed N $\\approx$ 90\nrare-earth nuclei, and quadrupole and octupole shape transitions in thorium\nisotopes.\n", "  Cryogenic liquids, particularly liquid xenon and argon, are of interest as\ndetector media for experiments in nuclear and particle physics. Here we present\na new detector diagnostic technique using piezoelectric sensors to detect\nbubbling of the liquid. Bubbling can indicate locations of excess heat\ndissipation e.g., in immersed electronics. They can also interfere with normal\nevent evolution by scattering of light or by interrupting the drift of\nionization charge. In our test apparatus, four sensors are placed in the vacuum\nspace of a double-walled dewar of liquid nitrogen and used to detect and locate\na source of bubbling inside the liquid volume. Utilizing the differences in\ntransmitted frequencies through the different media present in the experiment,\nwe find that sound traveling in a direct path from the source to the sensor can\nbe isolated with appropriate filtering. The location of the source is then\nreconstructed using the time difference of arrivals (TDOA) information. The\nreconstruction algorithm is shown to have a 95.8% convergence rate and\nreconstructed positions are self-consistent to an average +/-0.5cm around the\nmean in x, y, and z. Systematic effects are observed to cause errors in\nreconstruction when bubbles occur very close to the surfaces of the liquid\nvolume.\n", "  We present a comprehensive study of a model where the dark matter is composed\nof a singlet real scalar that couples to the Standard Model predominantly via a\nYukawa interaction with a light quark and a colored vector-like fermion. A\ndistinctive feature of this scenario is that thermal freeze-out in the early\nuniverse may be driven by annihilation both into gluon pairs at one-loop ($gg$)\nand by virtual internal Bremsstrahlung of a gluon ($q \\bar{q} g$). Such a dark\nmatter candidate may also be tested through direct and indirect detection and\nat the LHC; viable candidates have either a mass nearly degenerate with that of\nthe fermionic mediator or a mass above about 2 TeV.\n", "  We present a combined study with conventional far-infrared and time-domain\nterahertz ellipsometry of the temperature dependent optical response of SrTiO3\nthin films (85 and 8.5 nm) that are grown by pulsed-laser deposition on LSAT\nsubstrates. We demonstrate that terahertz ellipsometry is very sensitive to the\noptical response of these thin films, in particular, to the soft mode of\nSrTiO3. We show that for the 85 nm film the eigenfrequency of the soft mode is\nstrongly reduced by annealing at 1200 C, whereas for the 8.5 nm film it is\nhardy affected. For the latter, after annealing the mode remains at 125 cm-1 at\n300 K and exhibits only a weak softening to about 90 cm-1 at 10 K. This\nsuggests that this ultrathin film undergoes hardly any relaxation of the\ncompressive strain due to the LSAT substrate.\n", "  We study mimetic $F(R)$ gravity with potential and Lagrange multiplier\nconstraint. In the context of these theories, we introduce a reconstruction\ntechnique which enables us to realize arbitrary cosmologies, given the Hubble\nrate and an arbitrarily chosen $F(R)$ gravity. We exemplify our method by\nrealizing cosmologies that are in concordance with current observations (Planck\ndata) and also well known bouncing cosmologies. The attribute of our method is\nthat the $F(R)$ gravity can be arbitrarily chosen, so we can have the appealing\nfeatures of the mimetic approach combined with the known features of some\n$F(R)$ gravities, which unify early-time with late-time acceleration. Moreover,\nwe study the existence and the stability of de Sitter points in the context of\nmimetic $F(R)$ gravity. In the case of unstable de Sitter points, it is\ndemonstrated that graceful exit from inflation occurs. We also study the\nEinstein frame counterpart theory of the Jordan frame mimetic $F(R)$ gravity,\nwe discuss the general properties of the theory and exemplify our analysis by\nstudying a quite interesting from a phenomenological point of view, model with\ntwo scalar fields. We also calculate the observational indices of the two\nscalar field model, by using the two scalar field formalism. Furthermore, we\nextensively study the dynamical system that corresponds to the mimetic $F(R)$\ngravity, by finding the fixed points and studying their stability. Finally, we\nmodify our reconstruction method to function in the inverse way and thus\nyielding which $F(R)$ gravity can realize a specific cosmological evolution,\ngiven the mimetic potential and the Lagrange multiplier.\n", "  Detection of scintillation light can play several important roles in LArTPCs.\nIncreased collection efficiency could result in the improvement of time,\nenergy, and position resolution. The SBND collaboration is developing detailed\nMC simulations to study the performance of different types of light systems in\nthe LArSoft framework. Due to the vast number of photons typically produced in\nneutrino physics events, a full optical simulation becomes extremely hard to\nrun on reasonable time scales. I will describe how the SBND simulation tackles\nthese problems and its current status for two of the light detection systems\nconsidered by SBND: (i) a traditional TPB-coated PMT based system and (ii) a\nsystem based on TPB-coated reflector foils to increase collection efficiency\nwithout increasing the number of photodetectors.\n", "  The Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) together with the Long\nBaseline Neutrino Facility (LBNF) hosted at the Fermilab will provide a unique,\nworld-leading program for the exploration of key questions at the forefront of\nneutrino physics and astrophysics. CP violation in neutrino flavor mixing is\none of its most important potential discoveries. Additionally, the experiment\nwill determine the neutrino mass hierarchy and precisely measure the neutrino\nmixing parameters which may potentially reveal new fundamental symmetries of\nnature. Moreover, the DUNE is also designed for the observation of nucleon\ndecay and supernova burst neutrinos. The photon detection (PD) system in the\nDUNE far detector provides trigger for cosmic backgrounds, enhances supernova\nburst trigger efficiency and improves the energy resolution of the detector.\nThe DUNE adopts the technology of liquid argon time projection chamber (LArTPC)\nthat requires the PD sensors, silicon photomultipliers (SiPM), to be carefully\nchosen to not only work properly in cryostat, but also meet certain\nspecifications for the life of the experiment. A comprehensive testing of SiPMs\nin cryostat is necessary since the datasheet provided by the manufactures in\nthe market does not cover this temperature regime. This paper gives the\ndetailed characterization results of SenSL C-Series 60035 SiPMs, including\ngain, dark count rate (DCR), cross-talk and after-pulse rate. Characteristic\nstudies on SiPMs from other vendors are also discussed in order to avoid any\npotential problems associated with using a single source. Moreover, the results\nof the ongoing mechanical durability tests are shown for the current candidate,\nSenSL B/C-Series 60035 SiPMs.\n", "  We demonstrate electron spin polarization detection and electron paramagnetic\nresonance (EPR) spectroscopy using a direct current superconducting quantum\ninterference device (dc-SQUID) magnetometer. Our target electron spin ensemble\nis directly glued on the dc-SQUID magnetometer that detects electron spin\npolarization induced by a external magnetic field or EPR in micrometer-sized\narea. The minimum distinguishable number of polarized spins and sensing volume\nof the electron spin polarization detection and the EPR spectroscopy are\nestimated to be $\\sim$$10^6$ and $\\sim$$10^{-10}$ $\\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ ($\\sim$0.1\npl), respectively.\n", "  The lattice simulations of $QC_2D$ with two flavors of staggered fermions and\nnon-zero quark chemical potential $\\mu_q$ have been performed. Dependencies of\nthe Polyakov loop, chiral condensate and baryon number density on $\\mu_q$ were\nstudied. We found that an increase of the baryon chemical potential leads to\nchiral symmetry restoration. At small values of $\\mu_q$, our results for the\nbaryon number density agree with ChPT predictions.\n", "  We study radiative corrections to the decay rate of false vacua, paying\nparticular attention to the renormalization-scale dependence of the decay rate.\nThe decay rate exponentially depends on the bounce action. The bounce action\nitself is renormalization scale dependent. To make the decay rate\nscale-independent, radiative corrections, which are due to the field\nfluctuations around the bounce, have to be included. We show quantitatively\nthat the inclusion of the fluctuations suppresses the scale dependence, and\nhence is important for the precise calculation of the decay rate. We also apply\nour analysis to a supersymmetric model and show that the radiative corrections\nare important for the Higgs-stau system with charge breaking minima.\n", "  We investigate separations of trapped balanced two-component atomic Fermi\ngases with repulsive contact interaction. Candidates for ground-state densities\nare obtained from the imaginary-time evolution of a nonlinear\npseudo-Schr\\\"odinger equation in three dimensions, rather than from the\ncumbersome variational equations. With the underlying hydrodynamical approach,\ngradient corrections to the Thomas-Fermi approximation are conveniently\nincluded and are shown to be vital for reliable density profiles. We provide\ncritical repulsion strengths that mark the onset of phase transitions in a\nharmonic trap. We present transitions from identical density profiles of the\ntwo fermion species towards isotropic and anisotropic separations for various\nconfinements, including harmonic and double-well-type traps. Our proposed\nmethod is suited for arbitrary trap geometries and can be straightforwardly\nextended to study dynamics in the light of ongoing experiments on degenerate\nFermi gases.\n", "  When a liquid droplet impacts a hot solid surface, enough vapor may be\ngenerated under it as to prevent its contact with the solid. The minimum solid\ntemperature for this so-called Leidenfrost effect to occur is termed the\nLeidenfrost temperature, or the dynamic Leidenfrost temperature when the\ndroplet velocity is non-negligible. We observe the wetting/drying and the\nlevitation dynamics of the droplet impacting on an (isothermal) smooth sapphire\nsurface using high speed total internal reflection imaging, which enables us to\nobserve the droplet base up to about 100 nm above the substrate surface. By\nthis method we are able to reveal the processes responsible for the\ntransitional regime between the fully wetting and the fully levitated droplet\nas the solid temperature increases, thus shedding light on the characteristic\ntime- and length-scales setting the dynamic Leidenfrost temperature for droplet\nimpact on an isothermal substrate.\n", "  We study the Witten effect of hidden monopoles on the QCD axion dynamics, and\nshow that its abundance as well as isocurvature perturbations can be\nsignificantly suppressed if there is a sufficient amount of hidden monopoles.\nWhen the hidden monopoles make up a significant fraction of dark matter, the\nWitten effect suppresses the abundance of axion with the decay constant smaller\nthan $10^{12}$ GeV. The cosmological domain wall problem of the QCD axion can\nalso be avoided, relaxing the upper bound on the decay constant when the\nPeccei-Quinn symmetry is spontaneously broken after inflation.\n", "  We study $\\Lambda$ and $\\bar{\\Lambda}$ production asymmetries in $p \\bar{p}\n\\rightarrow \\Lambda (\\bar{\\Lambda}) X$, $p \\bar{p} \\rightarrow J/\\psi \\Lambda\n(\\bar{\\Lambda}) X$, and $p \\bar{p} \\rightarrow \\mu^\\pm \\Lambda (\\bar{\\Lambda})\nX$ events recorded by the D0 detector at the Fermilab Tevatron collider at\n$\\sqrt{s} = 1.96$ TeV. We find an excess of $\\Lambda$'s ($\\bar{\\Lambda}$'s)\nproduced in the proton (antiproton) direction. This forward-backward asymmetry\nis measured as a function of rapidity. We confirm that the\n$\\bar{\\Lambda}/\\Lambda$ production ratio, measured by several experiments with\nvarious targets and a wide range of energies, is a universal function of\n\"rapidity loss\", i.e., the rapidity difference of the beam proton and the\nlambda.\n", "  We propose a fully ab initio method, the opposing crystal potential (OCP), to\ncalculate the crystal field parameters of transition metal impurities in\ninsulator hosts. Through constrained density functional calculations, OCP\nobtains the constraining Lagrange multipliers, which act as cancellation\npotential against the crystal field and lead to spherical $d$-electron\ndistribution. The method is applied to several insulators doped with Mn$^{4+}$\nand Mn$^{2+}$ ions and shown to be in good agreement with experiment.\n", "  Large field inflation can be sensitive to perturbative and nonperturbative\nquantum corrections that spoil slow roll. A large number $N$ of light species\nin the theory, which occur in many string constructions, can amplify these\nproblems. One might even worry that in a de Sitter background, light species\nwill lead to a violation of the covariant entropy bound at large $N$. If so,\nrequiring the validity of the covariant entropy bound could limit the number of\nlight species and their couplings, which in turn could severely constrain\naxion-driven inflation. Here we show that there is no such problem when we\ncorrectly renormalize models with many light species, taking the {\\it physical}\nPlanck scale to be $M^2_{pl} \\gtrsim N {\\cal M}_{UV}^2$, where ${\\cal M}_{UV}$\nis the cutoff for the QFT coupled to semiclassical quantum gravity. The number\nof light species then cancels out of the gravitational entropy of de Sitter or\nnear-de Sitter backgrounds at leading order. Working in detail with $N$ scalar\nfields in de Sitter space, renormalized to one loop order, we show that the\ngravitational entropy automatically obeys the covariant entropy bound.\nFurthermore, while the axion decay constant is a strong coupling scale for the\naxion dynamics, we show that it is {\\it not} in general the cutoff of 4d\nsemiclassical gravity. After renormalizing the two point function of the\ninflaton, we note that it is also controlled by scales much below the cutoff.\nWe revisit $N$-flation and KKLT-type compactifications in this light, and show\nthat they are perfectly consistent with the covariant entropy bound. Thus,\nwhile quantum gravity might yet spoil large field inflation, holographic\nconsiderations in the semiclassical theory do not obstruct it.\n", "  Geodesic incompleteness is a problem in both general relativity and string\ntheory. The Weyl invariant Standard Model coupled to General Relativity\n(SM+GR), and a similar treatment of string theory, are improved theories that\nare geodesically complete. A notable prediction of this approach is that there\nmust be antigravity regions of spacetime connected to gravity regions through\ngravitational singularities such as those that occur in black holes and\ncosmological bang/crunch. Antigravity regions introduce apparent problems of\nghosts that raise several questions of physical interpretation. It was shown\nthat unitarity is not violated but there may be an instability associated with\nnegative kinetic energies in the antigravity regions. In this paper we show\nthat the apparent problems can be resolved with the interpretation of the\ntheory from the perspective of observers strictly in the gravity region. Such\nobservers cannot experience the negative kinetic energy in antigravity\ndirectly, but can only detect in and out signals that interact with the\nantigravity region. This is no different than a spacetime black box for which\nthe information about its interior is encoded in scattering amplitudes for\nin/out states at its exterior. Through examples we show that negative kinetic\nenergy in antigravity presents no problems of principles but is an interesting\ntopic for physical investigations of fundamental significance.\n", "  The processes leading to the birth of high-mass stars are poorly understood.\nWe characterise here a sample of 430 massive clumps from the ATLASGAL survey,\nwhich are representative of different evolutionary stages. To establish a\ncensus of molecular tracers of their evolution we performed an unbiased\nspectral line survey covering the 3-mm atmospheric window between 84-117 GHz\nwith the IRAM 30m. A smaller sample of 128 clumps has been observed in the SiO\n(5-4) transition with the APEX telescope to complement the SiO (2-1) line and\nprobe the excitation conditions of the emitting gas, which is the main focus of\nthe current study. We report a high detection rate of >75% of the SiO (2-1)\nline and a >90% detection rate from the dedicated follow-ups in the (5-4)\ntransition. The SiO (2-1) line with broad line profiles and high detection\nrates, is a powerful probe of star formation activity, while the ubiquitous\ndetection of SiO in all evolutionary stages suggests a continuous star\nformation process in massive clumps. We find a large fraction of infrared-quiet\nclumps to exhibit SiO emission, the majority of them only showing a\nlow-velocity component (FWHM~5-6 km/s) centred at the rest velocity of the\nclump. In the current picture, where this is attributed to low-velocity shocks\nfrom cloud-cloud collisions, this can be used to pinpoint the youngest, thus,\nlikely prestellar massive structures. Based on the line ratio of the (5-4) to\nthe (2-1) line, our study reveals a trend of changing excitation conditions\nthat lead to brighter emission in the (5-4) line towards more evolved sources.\nOur analysis delivers a more robust estimate of SiO column density and\nabundance than previous studies and questions the decrease of jet activity in\nmassive clumps as a function of age.\n", "  Debris disks are signposts of analogues to small body populations of the\nSolar System, often however with much higher masses and dust production rates.\nThe disk associated with the nearby star Eta Corvi is especially striking as it\nshows strong mid- and far-infrared excesses despite an age of ~1.4 Gyr. We\nundertake to construct a consistent model of the system able to explain a\ndiverse collection of spatial and spectral data. We analyze Keck Interferometer\nNuller measurements and revisit Spitzer and additional spectro-photometric\ndata, as well as resolved Herschel images to determine the dust spatial\ndistribution in the inner exozodi and in the outer belt. We model in detail the\ntwo-component disk and the dust properties from the sub-AU scale to the\noutermost regions by fitting simultaneously all measurements against a large\nparameter space. The properties of the cold belt are consistent with a\ncollisional cascade in a reservoir of ice-free planetesimals at 133 AU. It\nshows marginal evidence for asymmetries along the major axis. KIN enables us to\nestablish that the warm dust consists in a ring that peaks between 0.2 and 0.8\nAU. To reconcile this location with the ~400 K dust temperature, very high\nalbedo dust must be invoked and a distribution of forsterite grains starting\nfrom micron sizes satisfies this criterion while providing an excellent fit to\nthe spectrum. We discuss additional constraints from the LBTI and near-infrared\nspectra, and we present predictions of what JWST can unveil about this unusual\nobject and whether it can detect unseen planets.\n", "  We examine a modification of the Kuramoto model for phase oscillators coupled\non a network. Here, two populations of oscillators are considered, each with\ndifferent network topologies, internal and cross-network couplings and\nfrequencies. Additionally, frustration parameters for the interactions of the\ncross-network phases are introduced. This may be regarded as a model of\ncompeting populations: internal to any one network phase synchronisation is a\ntarget state, while externally one or both populations seek to frequency\nsynchronise to a phase in relation to the competitor. We conduct fixed point\nanalyses for two regimes: one, where internal phase synchronisation occurs for\neach population with the potential for instability in the phase of one\npopulation in relation to the other; the second where one part of a population\nremains fixed in phase in relation to the other population, but where\ninstability may occur within the first population leading to `fragmentation'.\nWe compare analytic results to numerical solutions for the system at various\ncritical thresholds.\n", "  Double diffusive convection (DDC), which is the buoyancy driven flow with\nfluid density depending on two scalar components, is ubiquitous in many natural\nand engineering enviroments. Of great interests are scalers transfer rate and\nflow structures. Here we systematically investigate DDC flow between two\nhorizontal plates, driven by an unstable salinity gradient and stabilized by a\ntemperature gradient. Counterintuitively, when increasing the stabilizing\ntemperature gradient, the salinity flux first increases, even though the\nvelocity monotonically decreases, before it finally breaks down to the purely\ndiffusive value. The enhanced salinity transport is traced back to a transition\nin the overall flow pattern, namely from large scale convection rolls to\nwell-organised vertically-oriented salt fingers. We also show and explain that\nthe unifying theory of thermal convection originally developed by Grossmann and\nLohse for Rayleigh-B\\'{e}nard convection can be directly applied to DDC flow\nfor a wide range of control parameters (Lewis number and density ratio),\nincluding those which cover the common values relevant for ocean flows.\n", "  We present progress in development of the truncated Mellin moments approach\n(TMMA). We show our recent results on the generalization of DGLAP evolution\nequations and discuss some their applications in spin physics.\n", "  In this paper we apply a supersymmetric generalization of the method of\nderivative expansion to compute the induced non-Abelian Chern-Simons term in\n$\\mathcal{N}=1$, $d=3$ superspace, for an arbitrary gauge group.\n", "  We study a simple effective field theory incorporating six heavy vector\nbosons together with the standard-model field content. The new particles\npreserve custodial symmetry as well as an approximate left-right parity\nsymmetry. The enhanced symmetry of the model allows it to satisfy precision\nelectroweak constraints and bounds from Higgs physics in a regime where all the\ncouplings are perturbative and where the amount of fine-tuning is comparable to\nthat in the standard model itself.\n  We find that the model could explain the recently observed excesses in\ndi-boson processes at invariant mass close to 2 TeV from LHC Run 1 for a range\nof allowed parameter space. The masses of all the particles differ by no more\nthan roughly 10%. In a portion of the allowed parameter space only one of the\nnew particles has a production cross section large enough to be detectable with\nthe energy and luminosity of Run 1, both via its decay to WZ and to Wh, while\nthe others have suppressed production rates. The model can be tested at the\nhigher-energy and higher-luminosity run of the LHC even for an overall scale of\nthe new particles higher than 3 TeV.\n", "  The paper explores quantum mechanics of half-spin particle motion in the\nfield of Reissner-Nordstroem (RN) naked singularity. It is shown that for any\nquantum mechanical Dirac particle, irrespective of availability and sign of its\nelectrical charge, the RN naked singularity is separated by an infinitely high\npositive potential barrier. With like charges of a particle and the source of\nthe RN naked singularity, near the origin there exists the second completely\nimpenetrable potential barrier. It has been proved that in the field of the RN\nnaked singularity, bound states of half-spin particles can exist. The\nconditions for appearance of such states were revealed and computations were\nperformed to find energy eigenvalues and eigenfunctions.\n", "  Remote observation of spectroscopic emissions is a potential tool for the\nidentification and quantification of various species in comets. CO Cameron band\n(to trace \\cod) and atomic oxygen emissions (to trace H$_2$O and/or CO$_2$, CO)\nhave been used to probe neutral composition in the cometary coma. Using a\ncoupled-chemistry emission model, various excitation processes controlling CO\nCameron band and different atomic oxygen and atomic carbon have been modelled\nin comet 67P-Churyumov-Gerasimenko at 1.29~AU (perihelion) and at 3~AU\nheliocentric distances, which is being explored by ESA's Rosetta mission. The\nintensities of CO Cameron band, atomic oxygen and atomic carbon emission lines\nas a function of projected distance are calculated for different CO and CO$_2$\nvolume mixing ratios relative to water. Contributions of different excitation\nprocesses controlling these emissions are quantified. We assess how CO$_2$\nand/or CO volume mixing ratios with respect to H$_2$O can be derived based on\nthe observed intensities of CO Cameron band, atomic oxygen, and atomic carbon\nemission lines.The results presented in this work serve as base line\ncalculations to understand the behaviour of low out-gassing cometary coma and\ncompare them with the higher gas production rate cases (e.g. comet Halley).\nQuantitative analysis of different excitation processes governing the\nspectroscopic emissions is essential to study the chemistry of inner coma and\nto derive neutral gas composition.\n", "  We discuss some model-independent implications of embedding (aligned) axionic\ninflation in string theory. As a consequence of string theoretic duality\nsymmetries the pure cosine potentials of natural inflation are replaced by\nmodular functions. This leads to \"wiggles\" in the inflationary potential that\nmodify the predictions with respect to CMB-observations. In particular, the\nscalar power spectrum deviates from the standard power law form. As a\nby-product one can show that trans-Planckian excursions of the aligned\neffective axion are compatible with the weak gravity conjecture.\n", "  The obliquities of planet-hosting stars are clues about the formation of\nplanetary systems. Previous observations led to the hypothesis that for\nclose-in giant planets, spin-orbit alignment is enforced by tidal interactions.\nHere, we examine two problems with this hypothesis. First, Mazeh and coworkers\nrecently used a new technique -- based on the amplitude of starspot-induced\nphotometric variability -- to conclude that spin-orbit alignment is common even\nfor relatively long-period planets, which would not be expected if tides were\nresponsible. We re-examine the data and find a statistically significant\ncorrelation between photometric variability and planetary orbital period that\nis qualitatively consistent with tidal interactions. However it is still\ndifficult to explain quantitatively, as it would require tides to be effective\nfor periods as long as tens of days. Second, Rogers and Lin argued against a\nparticular theory for tidal re-alignment by showing that initially retrograde\nsystems would fail to be re-aligned, in contradiction with the observed\nprevalence of prograde systems. We investigate a simple model that overcomes\nthis problem by taking into account the dissipation of inertial waves and the\nequilibrium tide, as well as magnetic braking. We identify a region of\nparameter space where re-alignment can be achieved, but it only works for\nclose-in giant planets, and requires some fine tuning. Thus, while we find both\nproblems to be more nuanced than they first appeared, the tidal model still has\nserious shortcomings.\n", "  The Disk of Satellites (DoS) observed in the Andromeda galaxy is a thin and\nextended group of satellites, nearly perpendicular to the disk plane, that\nshare a common direction of rotation about the centre of Andromeda. Although a\nDoS is also observed in the Milky Way galaxy, the prevalance of such structures\nin more distant galaxies remains controversial. Explanations for the formation\nof such DoSs vary widely from filamentary infall, or flattening due to the\npotential field from large scale structure, to galaxy interactions in a Mondian\nparadigm. Here we present an alternative scenario -- during a merger, a galaxy\nmay bring its own satellite population when merging with another galaxy. We\ndemonstrate how, under the correct circumstances, during the coalescence of the\ntwo galaxies, the satellite population can be spread into an extended,\nflattened structure, with a common direction of rotation about the merger\nremnant. We investigate the key parameters of the interaction, and the\nsatellite population, that are required to form a DoS in this scenario.\n", "  We report on a deep photometric survey covering an area of 1.17 deg$^2$ in\nthe young Upper Scorpius stellar association using VIMOS $Iz$ and UKIDSS $ZJHK$\ndata taking several years apart. The search for the least massive population of\nUpper Scorpius ($\\sim$5-10 Myr, 145 pc) is performed on the basis of various\noptical and infrared color-color and color-magnitude diagrams, including WISE\nphotometry, in the magnitude interval $J$=14.5-19 mag (completeness), which\ncorresponds to substellar masses from 0.028 through 0.004 M$_\\odot$ at the age\nand distance of Upper Scorpius. We also present the proper motion analysis of\nthe photometric candidates, finding that two objects successfully pass all\nphotometric and astrometric criteria for membership in the young stellar\nassociation. One of them, UScoJ155150.2$-$213457, is a new discovery. We\nobtained low resolution, near-infrared spectroscopy ($R\\sim$450, 0.85--2.35\n$\\mu$m) of this new finding using the FIRE instrument. We confirmed its\nlow-gravity atmosphere expected for an Upper Scorpius member (weak alkaline\nlines, strong VO absorption, peaked $H$-band pseudocontinuum). By comparison\nwith spectroscopic standards, we derive a spectral type of L6$\\pm$1, and\nestimate a mass of $\\approx$0.008-0.010 M$_\\odot$ for UScoJ155150.2$-$213457.\nThe colors and spectral slope of this object resemble those of other young,\ncool members of Upper Scorpius and $\\sigma$ Orionis ($\\sim$3 Myr) and field,\nhigh gravity dwarfs of related classification in contrast with the very red\nindices of field, low gravity, L-type dwarfs of intermediate age.\nUScoJ155150.2$-$213457, which does not show infrared flux excesses up to 4.5\n$\\mu$m, becomes one of the least massive and latest type objects known in the\nentire Upper Scorpius stellar association.\n", "  Using 3.6 and 4.5$\\mu$m images of 73 late-type, edge-on galaxies from the\nS$^4$G survey, we compare the richness of the globular cluster populations of\nthese galaxies to those of early type galaxies that we measured previously. In\ngeneral, the galaxies presented here fill in the distribution for galaxies with\nlower stellar mass, M$_*$, specifically $\\log({\\rm M}_*/{\\rm M}_\\odot) < 10$,\noverlap the results for early-type galaxies of similar masses, and, by doing\nso, strengthen the case for a dependence of the number of globular clusters per\n$10^9\\ {\\rm M}_\\odot$ of galaxy stellar mass, T$_{\\rm N}$, on M$_*$. For $8.5 <\n\\log ({\\rm M}_*/{\\rm M}_\\odot) < 10.5$ we find the relationship can be\nsatisfactorily described as T$_{\\rm N} = ({\\rm M}_*/10^{6.7})^{-0.56}$ when\nM$_*$ is expressed in solar masses. The functional form of the relationship is\nonly weakly constrained and extrapolation outside this range is not advised.\nOur late-type galaxies, in contrast to our early-types, do not show the\ntendency for low mass galaxies to split into two T$_{\\rm N}$ families. Using\nthese results and a galaxy stellar mass function from the literature, we\ncalculate that in a volume limited, local Universe sample, clusters are most\nlikely to be found around fairly massive galaxies (M$_* \\sim 10^{10.8}$\nM$_\\odot$) and present a fitting function for the volume number density of\nclusters as a function of parent galaxy stellar mass. We find no correlation\nbetween T$_{\\rm N}$ and large-scale environment, but do find a tendency for\ngalaxies of fixed M$_*$ to have larger T$_{\\rm N}$ if they have converted a\nlarger proportion of their baryons into stars.\n", "  The `excised ensemble', a random matrix model for the zeros of quadratic\ntwist families of elliptic curve $L$-functions, was introduced by Due\\~nez,\nHuynh, Keating, Miller and Snaith. The excised model is motivated by a formula\nfor central values of these $L$-functions in a paper by Kohnen and Zagier. This\nformula indicates that for a finite set of $L$-functions from a family of\nquadratic twists, the central values are all either zero or are greater than\nsome positive cutoff. The excised model imposes this same condition on the\ncentral values of characteristic polynomials of matrices from $SO(2N)$.\nStrangely, the cutoff on the characteristic polynomials that results in a\nconvincing model for the $L$-function zeros is significantly smaller than that\nwhich we would obtain by naively transferring Kohnen and Zagier's cutoff to the\n$SO(2N)$ ensemble. In this current paper we investigate a modification to the\nexcised model. It lacks the simplicity of the original excised ensemble, but it\nserves to explain the reason for the unexpectedly low cutoff in the original\nexcised model. Additionally, the distribution of central $L$-values is\n`choppier' than the distribution of characteristic polynomials, in the sense\nthat it is a superposition of a series of peaks: the characteristic polynomial\ndistribution is a smooth approximation to this. The excised model didn't\nattempt to incorporate these successive peaks, only the initial cutoff. Here we\nexperiment with including some of the structure of the $L$-value distribution.\nThe conclusion is that a critical feature of a good model is to associate the\ncorrect mass to the first peak of the $L$-value distribution.\n", "  The CMS Level-1 calorimeter trigger is being upgraded in two stages to\nmaintain performance as the LHC increases pile-up and instantaneous luminosity\nin its second run. In the first stage, improved algorithms including\nevent-by-event pile-up corrections are used. New algorithms for heavy ion\nrunning have also been developed. In the second stage, higher granularity\ninputs and a time-multiplexed approach allow for improved position and energy\nresolution. Data processing in both stages of the upgrade is performed with\nnew, Xilinx Virtex-7 based AMC cards.\n", "  We study the color-decoration of higher-spin (anti)-de Sitter gravity in\nthree dimensions. We show that the rainbow vacua, which we found recently for\nthe colored gravity theory, also pertain in the colored higher-spin theory. The\ncolor singlet spin-two plays the role of first fundamental form (metric). The\ndifference is that when spontaneous breaking of color symmetry takes place, the\nGoldstone modes of massless spin-two combine with all other spins and become\nthe maximal-depth partially massless fields of the highest spin in the theory,\nforming a Regge trajectory.\n", "  We present a new technique for tagging heavy-flavor jets with p_T > 500 GeV\ncalled \"mu_x tagging.\" Current track-based methods of b-jet tagging lose\nefficiency and experience a large rise in fake rate in the boosted regime.\nUsing muons from B hadron decay, we combine angular information and jet\nsubstructure to tag b jets, c jets, light jets, and \"light-heavy\" jets (those\ncontaining B hadrons from gluon splitting). We find tagging efficiencies of\nepsilon_b = 14%, epsilon_c = 6.5%, epsilon_{light-light} = 0.14%, and\nepsilon_{light-heavy} = 0.5%, respectively, that are nearly independent of\ntransverse momentum at high energy. We demonstrate the usefulness of this new\nscheme by examining the discovery potential for multi-TeV leptophobic Z-prime\nbosons in the boosted-b-tagged dijet channel at the Large Hadron Collider.\n", "  We present a method for detection and reconstruction of the\ngravitational-wave (GW) transients with the networks of advanced detectors.\nOriginally designed to search for transients with the initial GW detectors, it\nuses significantly improved algorithms, which enhances both the low-latency\nsearches with rapid localization of GW events for the electro-magnetic followup\nand high confidence detection of a broad range of the transient GW sources. In\nthe paper we present the analytic framework of the method. Following a short\ndescription of the core analysis algorithms, we introduce a novel approach to\nthe reconstruction of the GW polarization from a pattern of detector responses\nto a GW signal. This polarization pattern is a unique signature of an arbitrary\nGW signal that can be measured independent from the other source parameters.\nThe polarization measurements enable rapid reconstruction of the GW waveforms,\nsky localization and helps identification of the source origin.\n", "  We report the first observation of robust self-trapping of vortex beams\npropagating in a uniform condensed medium featuring local saturable\nself-focusing nonlinearity. Optical vortices with topological charge m=1, that\nremain self-trapped over ~ 5 Rayleigh lengths, are excited in carbon disulfide\nusing a helical light beam at 532 nm and intensities from 8 to 10 GW/cm^2. At\nlarger intensities, the vortex beams lose their stability, spontaneously\nbreaking into two fragments. Numerical simulations based on the nonlinear\nSchr\\\"odinger equation including the three-photon absorption and nonpolynomial\nsaturation of the refractive nonlinearity demonstrate close agreement with the\nexperimental findings.\n", "  Previous work on the physical content of exchange correlation functionals\nthat depend on both charge and spin densities is extended to elemental\ntransition metals and a wider range of perovskite transition metal oxides. A\ncomparison of spectra and magnetic moments calculated using exchange\ncorrelation functionals depending on charge density only or on both charge and\nspin densities, as well as the $+U$ and $+J$ extensions of these methods\nconfirms previous conclusions that the spin-dependent part of the exchange\ncorrelation functional provides an effective Hund's interaction acting on the\ntransition metal $d$ orbitals. For the local spin density approximation and\nspin-dependent Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof generalized gradient approximation, the\neffective Hund's exchange is found to be larger than 1 eV. The results indicate\nthat at least as far as applications to transition metals and their oxides are\nconcerned, $+U$, $+J$ and +dynamical mean field theory extensions of density\nfunctional theory should be based on exchange-correlation functionals of charge\ndensity only.\n", "  The set of solutions to the AdS$_3$ Einstein gravity with Brown-Henneaux\nboundary conditions is known to be a family of metrics labeled by two arbitrary\nperiodic functions, respectively left and right-moving. It turns out that there\nexists an appropriate presymplectic form which vanishes on-shell. This promotes\nthis set of metrics to a phase space in which the Brown-Henneaux asymptotic\nsymmetries become symplectic symmetries in the bulk of spacetime. Moreover, any\nelement in the phase space admits two global Killing vectors. We show that the\nconserved charges associated with these Killing vectors commute with the\nVirasoro symplectic symmetry algebra, extending the Virasoro symmetry algebra\nwith two $U(1)$ generators. We discuss that any element in the phase space\nfalls into the coadjoint orbits of the Virasoro algebras and that each orbit is\nlabeled by the $U(1)$ Killing charges. Upon setting the right-moving function\nto zero and restricting the choice of orbits, one can take a near-horizon\ndecoupling limit which preserves a chiral half of the symplectic symmetries.\nHere we show two distinct but equivalent ways in which the chiral Virasoro\nsymplectic symmetries in the near-horizon geometry can be obtained as a limit\nof the bulk symplectic symmetries.\n", "  Yang-Baxter R operators symmetric with respect to the orthogonal and\nsymplectic algebras are considered in an uniform way. Explicit forms for the\nspinorial and metaplectic R operators are obtained. L operators, obeying the\nRLL relation with the orthogonal or symplectic fundamental R matrix, are\nconsidered in the interesting cases, where their expansion in inverse powers of\nthe spectral parameter is truncated. Unlike the case of special linear algebra\nsymmetry the truncation results in additional conditions on the Lie algebra\ngenerators of which the L operators is built and which can be fulfilled in\ndistinguished representations only. Further, generalised L operators, obeying\nthe modified RLL relation with the fundamental R matrix replaced by the\nspinorial or metaplectic one, are considered in the particular case of linear\ndependence on the spectral parameter. It is shown how by fusion with respect to\nthe spinorial or metaplectic representation these first order spinorial L\noperators reproduce the ordinary L operators with second order truncation.\n", "  We study holographic renormalization of 3D minimal massive gravity using the\nChern-Simons-like formulation of the model. We explicitly present Gibbons-\nHawking term as well as all counterterms needed to make the action finite in\nterms of dreibein and spin-connection. This can be used to find correlation\nfunctions of stress tensor of holographic dual field theory.\n", "  We consider the two flavor Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model within the RPA framework\nto evaluate the masses of the $\\sigma$ and $\\pi^0$ mesons and the $\\pi^0$ decay\nconstant in the presence of a magnetic field at vanishing temperatures and\nbaryonic densities. The present work extends other RPA applications by fully\nconsidering the external momenta, which enter the integrals representing the\nmagnetized polarization tensor, so that more accurate results can be obtained\nin the evaluation of physical quantities containing pionic contributions. As we\nshow, this technical improvement generates results which agree well with those\nproduced by lattice simulations and chiral perturbation theory. Our method may\nalso prove to be useful in future evaluations of quantities such as the shear\nviscosity and the equation of state of magnetized quark matter with mesonic\ncontributions.\n", "  Recent analysis of the SDSS-III/APOGEE Data Release 12 stellar catalogue has\nrevealed that the Milky Way's metallicity distribution function (MDF) changes\nshape as a function of radius, transitioning from being negatively skewed at\nsmall Galactocentric radii to positively skewed at large Galactocentric radii.\nUsing a high resolution, N-body+SPH simulation, we show that the changing\nskewness arises from radial migration - metal-rich stars form in the inner disk\nand subsequently migrate to the metal-poorer outer disk. These migrated stars\nrepresent a large fraction (> 50%) of the stars in the outer disk; they\npopulate the high metallicity tail of the MDFs and are, in general, more\nmetal-rich than the surrounding outer disk gas. The simulation also reproduces\nanother surprising APOGEE result: the spatially invariant high-[alpha/Fe] MDFs.\nThis arises in the simulation from the migration of a population formed within\na narrow range of radii (3.2+/-1.2 kpc) and time (8.8+/-0.6 Gyr ago), rather\nthan from spatially extended star formation in a homogeneous medium at early\ntimes. These results point toward the crucial role radial migration has played\nin shaping our Milky Way.\n", "  The terrestrial planets and the asteroids dominant in the inner asteroid belt\nare water poor. However, in the protoplanetary disk the temperature should have\ndecreased below water condensation level well before the disk was\nphotoevaporated. Thus, the global water depletion of the inner Solar System is\npuzling. We show that, even if the inner disk becomes cold, there cannot be\ndirect condensation of water. This is because the snowline moves towards the\nSun more slowly than the gas itself. The appearance of ice in a range of\nheliocentric distances swept by the snowline can only be due to the radial\ndrift of icy particles from the outer disk. However, if a sufficiently massive\nplanet is present, the radial drift of particles is interrupted, because the\ndisk acquires a superKeplerian rotation just outside of the planetary orbit.\nFrom this result, we propose that the precursor of Jupiter achieved about 20\nEarth masses when the snowline was still around 3 AU. This effectively\nfossilized the snowline at that location. Although cooling, the disk inside of\nthe Jovian orbit remained ice-depleted because the flow of icy particles from\nthe outer system was intercepted by the planet. This scenario predicts that\nplanetary systems without giant planets should be much more rich in water in\ntheir inner regions than our system. We also show that the inner edge of the\nplanetesimal disk at 0.7AU, required in terrestrial planet formation models to\nexplain the small mass of Mercury and the absence of planets inside of its\norbit, could be due to the silicate condensation line, fossilized at the end of\nthe phase of streaming instability that generated the planetesimal seeds. Thus,\nwhen the disk cooled, silicate particles started to drift inwards of 0.7AU\nwithout being sublimated, but they could not be accreted by any pre-existing\nplanetesimals.\n", "  In 2015 March, the notable WZ Sge-type dwarf nova AL Com exhibited an unusual\noutburst with a recurrence time of ${\\sim}$1.5 yr, which is the shortest\ninterval of superoutbursts among WZ Sge-type dwarf novae. Early superhumps in\nthe superoutburst light curve were absent, and a precursor was observed at the\nonset of the superoutburst for the first time in WZ Sge-type dwarf novae. The\npresent superoutburst can be interpreted as a result of the condition that the\ndisk radius barely reached the 3:1 resonance radius, but did not reach the 2:1\nresonance one. Ordinary superhumps immediately grew following the precursor.\nThe initial part of the outburst is indistinguishable from those of\nsuperoutbursts of ordinary SU UMa-type dwarf novae. This observation supports\nthe interpretation that the 2:1 resonance suppresses a growth of ordinary\nsuperhumps. The estimated superhump period and superhump period derivative are\n$P_{\\rm sh}$ = 0.0573185(11) d and $P_{\\rm dot} = +1.5(3.1) \\times 10^{-5}$,\nrespectively. These values indicate that the evolution of ordinary superhumps\nis the same as that in past superoutbursts with much larger extent. Although\nthe light curve during the plateau stage was typical for an SU UMa-type dwarf\nnova, this superoutburst showed a rebrightening, together with a regrowth of\nthe superhumps. The overall light curve of the rebrightening was the almost the\nsame as those observed in previous rebrightenings. This implies that the\nrebrightening type is inherent in the system.\n", "  Double photo-electron momentum spectra of the Helium atom are calculated\n\\textit{ab initio} at extreme ultra-violet and near infrared wavelengths. At\nshort wavelengths two-photon double ionization yields, two-electron energy\nspectra, and triply differential cross sections agree with results from recent\nliterature. At the near infrared wavelength of $780\\,nm$ the experimental\nsingle-to-double ionization ratio is reproduced up to intensities of $4\\times\n10^{14}W/cm^2$, and two-electron energy spectra and joint angular distributions\nare presented. The time-dependent surface flux (tSurff) approach is extended to\nfull 3+3 spatial dimensions and systematic error control is demonstrated. We\nanalyze our differential spectra in terms of an experimentally accessible\nquantitative measure of correlation.\n", "  Darwin's theory of evolution - as introduced in game theory by Maynard Smith\n- is not the only important evolutionary aspect in a evolutionary dynamics,\nsince complex interdependencies, competition, and growth should be modeled by,\nfor example, reactive aspects. In the ultimatum game the reciprocity and the\nfifty-fifty partition seems to be a deviation from rational behavior of the\nplayers under the light of the Nash equilibrium concept.Such equilibrium\nemerges, for example, from the punishment of the responder who generally tends\nto refuse unfair proposals. In the iterated version of the game, the proposers\nare able to improve their proposals by adding a value thus making fairer\nproposals. Such evolutionary aspects are not properly Darwinian-motivated, but\nthey are endowed with a fundamental aspect: they reflect their actions\naccording to value of the offers. Recently, a reactive version of the ultimatum\ngame where acceptance occurs with fixed probability was proposed. In this\npaper, we aim at exploring this reactive version of the ultimatum game where\nthe acceptance by players depends on the offer. In order to do so, we analyze\ntwo situations: (i) mean field and (ii) we consider players inserted within the\nnetworks with arbitrary coordination. We then show that the reactive aspect,\nhere studied, thus far not analyzed in the evolutionary game theory literature\ncan unveil an essential feature for the convergence to fifty-fifty split.\nMoreover we also analyze populations under four different polices ranging from\na highly conservative to a moderate one, with respect to decision in changing\nthe proposal based on acceptations. We show that the idea of gaining less more\ntimes added to the reciprocity of the players is highly relevant to the\n\"healthy\" societies population bargaining concept.\n", "  The slow non-monotonic relaxation processes, which have been recently fixed\nin Al-Y melts, are described theoretically. The theoretical description is\nbased on the Cahn-Hilliard theory and functional methods of non-equilibrium\ndynamics. In terms of the suggested approach the reasons of this relaxation\nkinetics are non-linearity of the system near to the liquidus line, which\nsharply increases with Y concentration, and strong initial heterogeneity of the\nmelt on the concentration of Y atoms. According to our analysis one can\nconclude that the non-monotonic temporal dependence of viscosity is caused by\nthe Ostwald ripening processes in the rich in yttrium areas.\n", "  Quantum information processing holds great promise for communicating and\ncomputing data efficiently. However, scaling current photonic implementation\napproaches to larger system size remains an outstanding challenge for realizing\ndisruptive quantum technology. Two main ingredients of quantum information\nprocessors are quantum interference and single-photon detectors. Here we\ndevelop a hybrid superconducting-photonic circuit system to show how these\nelements can be combined in a scalable fashion on a silicon chip. We\ndemonstrate the suitability of this approach for integrated quantum optics by\ninterfering and detecting photon pairs directly on the chip with\nwaveguide-coupled single-photon detectors. Using a directional coupler\nimplemented with silicon nitride nanophotonic waveguides, we observe 97%\ninterference visibility when measuring photon statistics with two\nmonolithically integrated superconducting single photon detectors. The photonic\ncircuit and detector fabrication processes are compatible with standard\nsemiconductor thin-film technology, making it possible to implement more\ncomplex and larger scale quantum photonic circuits on silicon chips.\n", "  Active galactic nuclei (AGN) show evidence for reprocessing gas, outflowing\nfrom the accreting black hole. The combined effects of absorption and\nscattering from the circumnuclear material likely explains the `hard excess' of\nX-ray emission above 20 keV, compared with extrapolation of spectra from lower\nX-ray energies. In a recent {\\it Suzaku} study, we established the ubiquitous\nhard excess in hard X-ray-selected, radio-quiet type\\,1 AGNs to be consistent\nwith reprocessing of the X-ray continuum an ensemble of clouds, located tens to\nhundreds of gravitational radii from the nuclear black hole. Here we add hard\nX-ray-selected, type\\,2 AGN to extend our original study and show that the\ngross X-ray spectral properties of the entire local population of radio quiet\nAGN may be described by a simple unified scheme. We find a broad, continuous\ndistribution of spectral hardness ratio and Fe\\,K$\\alpha$ equivalent width\nacross all AGN types, which can be reproduced by varying the observer's\nsightline through a single, simple model cloud ensemble, provided the radiative\ntransfer through the model cloud distribution includes not only photoelectric\nabsorption but also 3D Compton scattering. Variation in other parameters of the\ncloud distribution, such as column density or ionisation, should be expected\nbetween AGN, but such variation is not required to explain the gross X-ray\nspectral properties.\n", "  The NEXT neutrinoless double beta decay experiment will use a high- pressure\ngas electroluminescence-based TPC to search for the decay of Xe-136. One of the\nmain advantages of this technology is the possibility to reconstruct the\ntopology of events with energies close to Qbb. The rejection potential\nassociated to the topology reconstruction is limited by our capacity to prop-\nerly reconstruct the original path of the electrons in the gas. This\nreconstruction is limited by different factors that include the geometry of the\ndetector, the density of the sensors in the tracking plane and the separation\namong them, etc. Ultimately, the resolution is limited by the physics of\nelectron diffusion in the gas. In this paper we present a series of molecular\nadditives that can be used in Xenon gas at very low partial pressure to reduce\nboth longitudinal and transverse diffusion. We will show the results of\ndifferent Monte-Carlo simulations of electron transport in the gas mixtures\nfrom wich we have extracted the value of some important parameters like\ndiffusion, drift velocity and light yields. These results show that there is a\nseries of candidates that can reduce diffusion without affecting the energy\nresolution of the detector and they should be studied experimentally. A\ncomparison with preliminary results from such an ongoing experimental effort is\ngiven.\n", "  Understanding and controlling physical aging, i.e. the spontaneous temporal\nevolution of out-of-equilibrium systems, represents one of the greatest tasks\nin material science. Recent studies have revealed the existence of a complex\natomic motion in metallic glasses, with different aging regimes in contrast\nwith the typical continuous aging observed in macroscopic quantities. By\ncombining dynamical and structural synchrotron techniques, for the first time\nwe directly connect previously identified microscopic structural mechanisms\nwith the peculiar atomic motion, providing a broader unique view of their\ncomplexity. We show that the atomic scale is dominated by the interplay between\ntwo processes: rearrangements releasing residual stresses related to a cascade\nmechanism of relaxation, and medium range ordering processes, which do not\naffect the local density, likely due to localized relaxations of liquid-like\nregions. As temperature increases, a surprising additional secondary relaxation\nprocess sets in, together with a faster medium range ordering, likely\nprecursors of crystallization.\n", "  Complex networks have attracted growing attention in many fields. As a\ngeneralization of fractal analysis, multifractal analysis (MFA) is a useful way\nto systematically describe the spatial heterogeneity of both theoretical and\nexperimental fractal patterns. Some algorithms for MFA of unweighted complex\nnetworks have been proposed in the past a few years, including the sandbox (SB)\nalgorithm recently employed by our group. In this paper, a modified SB\nalgorithm (we call it SBw algorithm) is proposed for MFA of weighted\nnetworks.First, we use the SBw algorithm to study the multifractal property of\ntwo families of weighted fractal networks (WFNs): \"Sierpinski\" WFNs and \"Cantor\ndust\" WFNs. We also discuss how the fractal dimension and generalized fractal\ndimensions change with the edge-weights of the WFN. From the comparison between\nthe theoretical and numerical fractal dimensions of these networks, we can find\nthat the proposed SBw algorithm is efficient and feasible for MFA of weighted\nnetworks. Then, we apply the SBw algorithm to study multifractal properties of\nsome real weighted networks ---collaboration networks. It is found that the\nmultifractality exists in these weighted networks, and is affected by their\nedge-weights.\n", "  In the framework of the present phase -- IPOPv2 -- of the international\nOpacity Project (OP), a new web service has been implemented based on the\nlatest release of the OP opacities. The user may construct online opacity\ntables to be conveniently included in stellar evolution codes in the format\nmost commonly adopted by stellar physicists, namely the OPAL format. This\nfacility encourages the use and comparison of both the OPAL and OP data sets in\napplications. The present service allows for the calculation of multi-element\nmixtures containing the 17 species (H, He, C, N, O, Ne, Na, Mg, Al, Si, S, Ar,\nCa, Cr, Mn, Fe and Ni) considered by the OP, and underpins the latest release\nof OP opacities. This new service provides tables of Rosseland mean opacites\nusing OP atomic data. We provide an alternative to the OPAL opacity services\nallowing direct comparison as well as study of the effect of uncertainties in\nstellar modeling due to mean opacities.\n", "  Acoustic waves traveling through the early Universe imprint a characteristic\nscale in the clustering of galaxies, QSOs and inter-galactic gas. This scale\ncan be used as a standard ruler to map the expansion history of the Universe, a\ntechnique known as Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO). BAO offer a\nhigh-precision, low-systematics means of constraining our cosmological model.\nThe statistical power of BAO measurements can be improved if the `smearing' of\nthe acoustic feature by non-linear structure formation is undone in a process\nknown as reconstruction. In this paper we use low-order Lagrangian perturbation\ntheory to study the ability of $21\\,$cm experiments to perform reconstruction\nand how augmenting these surveys with galaxy redshift surveys at relatively low\nnumber densities can improve performance. We find that the critical number\ndensity which must be achieved in order to benefit $21\\,$cm surveys is set by\nthe linear theory power spectrum near its peak, and corresponds to densities\nachievable by upcoming surveys of emission line galaxies such as eBOSS and\nDESI. As part of this work we analyze reconstruction within the framework of\nLagrangian perturbation theory with local Lagrangian bias, redshift-space\ndistortions, ${\\bf k}$-dependent noise and anisotropic filtering schemes.\n", "  Aims: We evaluate the radial velocity (RV) information content and achievable\nprecision on M0-M9 spectra covering the ZYJHK bands. We do so while considering\nboth a perfect atmospheric transmission correction and discarding areas\npolluted by deep telluric features, as done in previous works.\n  Methods: To simulate the M-dwarf spectra, PHOENIX-ACES model spectra were\nemployed; they were convolved with rotational kernels and instrumental profiles\nto reproduce stars with a $v.sin{i}$ of 1.0, 5.0, and 10.0 km/s when observed\nat resolutions of 60 000, 80 000, and 100 000. We considered the RV precision\nas calculated on the whole spectra, after discarding strongly polluted areas,\nand after applying a perfect telluric correction. In our simulations we paid\nparticular attention to the details of the convolution and sampling of the\nspectra, and we discuss their impact on the final spectra.\n  Results: Our simulations show that the most important parameter ruling the\ndifference in attainable precision between the considered bands is the spectral\ntype. For M0-M3 stars, the bands that deliver the most precise RV measurements\nare the Z, Y, and H band, with relative merits depending on the parameters of\nthe simulation. For M6-M9 stars, the bands show a difference in precision that\nis within a factor of $\\sim$2 and does not clearly depend on the band; this\ndifference is reduced to a factor smaller than $\\sim$1.5 if we consider a\nnon-rotating star seen at high resolution. We also show that an M6-M9 spectrum\nwill deliver a precision about two times better as an M0-M3 spectra with the\nsame signal-to-noise ratio. Finally, we note that the details of modelling the\nEarth atmosphere and interpreting the results have a significant impact on\nwhich wavelength regions are discarded when setting a limit threshold at 2-3%.\n(abridged)\n", "  In the context of a physical theory, two devices, A and B, described by the\ntheory are called incompatible if the theory does not allow the existence of a\nthird device C that would have both A and B as its components. Incompatibility\nis a fascinating aspect of physical theories, especially in the case of quantum\ntheory. The concept of incompatibility gives a common ground for several famous\nimpossibility statements within quantum theory, such as ``no-cloning'' and ``no\ninformation without disturbance''; these can be all seen as statements about\nincompatibility of certain devices. The purpose of this paper is to give a\nconcise overview of some of the central aspects of incompatibility.\n", "  Atomically thin layered two-dimensional materials, including transition-metal\ndichacolgenide (TMDC) and black phosphorus (BP), (1) have been receiving much\nattention, because of their promising physical properties and potential\napplications in flexible and transparent electronic devices . Here, for the\nfirst time we show non-volatile chargetrap memory devices, based on\nfield-effect transistors with large hysteresis, consisting of a few-layer black\nphosphorus channel and a three dimensional (3D) Al2O3 /HfO2 /Al2O3 charge-trap\ngate stack. An unprecedented memory window exceeding 12 V is observed, due to\nthe extraordinary trapping ability of HfO2. The device shows a high endurance\nand a stable retention of ?25% charge loss after 10 years, even drastically\nlower than reported MoS2 flash memory. The high program/erase current ratio,\nlarge memory window, stable retention and high on/off current ratio, provide a\npromising route towards the flexible and transparent memory devices utilising\natomically thin two-dimensional materials. The combination of 2D materials with\ntraditional high-k charge-trap gate stacks opens up an exciting field of\nnonvolatile memory devices.\n", "  Aims. Numerical test-particle simulations are a reliable and frequently used\ntool to test analytical transport theories and to predict mean-free paths. The\ncomparison between solutions of the diffusion equation and the particle flux is\nused to critically judge the applicability of diffusion to the stochastic\ntransport of energetic particles in magnetized turbulence. Methods. A\nMonte-Carlo simulation code is extended to allow for the generation of\nintensity profiles as well as anisotropy-time profiles. Due to the relatively\nlow number density of computational particles, a kernel function has to be used\nto describe the spatial extent of each particle. Results. The obtained\nintensity profiles are interpreted as solutions of the diffusion equation by\ninserting the diffusion coefficients that have been directly determined from\nthe mean-square displacements. The comparison shows that the time dependence of\nthe diffusion coefficients needs to be considered, in particular the initial\nballistic phase and the often sub-diffusive perpendicular coefficient.\nConclusions. It is argued that the perpendicular component of the distribution\nfunction is essential if agreement between the diffusion solution and the\nsimulated flux is to be obtained. In addition, time-dependent diffusion can\nprovide a better description than the classic diffusion equation only after the\ninitial ballistic phase.\n"]}
