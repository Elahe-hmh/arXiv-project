In many-body systems\nquantum mechanical noise reveals non-local correlations of the underlying\nmany-body states. Here, we provide a complete experimental analysis of the\nshot-to-shot variations of interference fringe contrast for pairs of\nindependently created one-dimensional Bose condensates. Analyzing different\nsystem sizes we observe the crossover from thermal to quantum noise, reflected\nin a characteristic change in the distribution functions from Poissonian to\nGumbel-type, in excellent agreement with theoretical predictions based on the\nLuttinger liquid formalism. We present the first experimental observation of\nquasi long-range order in one-dimensional atomic condensates, which is a\nhallmark of quantum fluctuations in one-dimensional systems. Furthermore, our\nexperiments constitute the first analysis of the full distribution of quantum\nnoise in an interacting many-body system.\n", "  A representation theory of finite electromagnetic beams in free space is\nformulated by factorizing the field vector of the plane-wave component into a\n$3 \\times 2$ mapping matrix and a 2-component Jones-like vector. The mapping\nmatrix has one degree of freedom that can be described by the azimuthal angle\nof a fixed unit vector with respect to the wave vector. This degree of freedom\nallows us to find out such a beam solution in which every plane-wave component\nis specified by the same fixed unit vector $\\mathbf{I}$ and has the same\nnormalized Jones-like vector. The angle $\\theta_I$ between the fixed unit\nvector and the propagation axis acts as a parameter that describes the\nvectorial property of the beam. The impact of $\\theta_I$ is investigated on a\nbeam of angular-spectrum field scalar that is independent of the azimuthal\nangle. The field vector in position space is calculated in the first-order\napproximation under the paraxial condition. A transverse effect is found that a\nbeam of elliptically-polarized angular spectrum is displaced from the center in\nthe direction that is perpendicular to the plane formed by the fixed unit\nvector and the propagation axis. The expression of the transverse displacement\nis obtained. Its paraxial approximation is also given.\n", "  With this paper, a consistent and comprehensive treatise on the foundations\nof the extended Hamilton-Lagrange formalism will be presented. In this\nformalism, the system's dynamics is parametrized along a time-like system\nevolution parameter $s$, and the physical time $t$ is treated as a dependent\nvariable $t(s)$ on equal footing with all other configuration space variables\n$q^{i}(s)$. In the action principle, the conventional classical action $L dt$\nis then replaced by the generalized action $L_{e}ds$, with $L$ and $L_{e}$\ndenoting the conventional and the extended Lagrangian, respectively. In the\nexisting literature, the discussion is restricted to only those extended\nLagrangians $L_{e}$ that are homogeneous forms of first order in the\nvelocities.\n  It is shown that a class of extended Lagrangians $L_{e}$ exists that are\ncorrelated to corresponding conventional Lagrangians $L$ without being\nhomogeneous functions in the velocities. Then the Legendre transformation of\n$L_{e}$ to an extended Hamiltonian $H_{e}$ exists. With this class of extended\nHamiltonians, an extended canonical formalism is presented that is completely\nanalogous to the conventional Hamiltonian formalism. The physical time $t$ and\nthe negative value of the conventional Hamiltonian then constitute and an\nadditional pair of conjugate canonical variables. The extended formalism also\nincludes a theory of extended canonical transformations, where the time\nvariable $t(s)$ is also subject to transformation.\n  In the extended formalism, the system's dynamics is described as a motion on\na hypersurface within an extended phase space of even dimension. It is shown\nthat the hypersurface condition does not embody a constraint as the condition\nis automatically satisfied on the system path that is given by the solution of\nthe extended set of canonical equations.\n", "  It is shown that the momentum density of free electromagnetic field splits\ninto two parts. One has no contribution to the net momentum due to the\ntransversality condition. The other yields all the momentum. The angular\nmomentum that originates from the former part is spin, and the angular momentum\nthat originates from the latter part is orbital angular momentum. Expressions\nfor the spin and orbital angular momentum are given in terms of the electric\nvector in reciprocal space. The spin and orbital angular momentum defined this\nway are used to investigate the angular momentum of nonparaxial beams that are\ndescribed in a recently published paper [Phys. Rev. A 78, 063831 (2008)]. It is\nfound that the orbital angular momentum depends, apart from an $l$-dependent\nterm, on two global quantities, the polarization represented by a generalized\nJones vector and a new characteristic represented by a unit vector\n$\\mathbf{I}$, though the spin depends only on the polarization. The\npolarization dependence of orbital angular momentum through the effect of\n$\\mathbf{I}$ is obtained and discussed. Some applications of the result\nobtained here are also made. The fact that the spin originates from the part of\nmomentum density that has no contribution to the net momentum is used to show\nthat there does not exist the paradox on the spin of circularly polarized plane\nwave. The polarization dependence of both spin and orbital angular momentum is\nshown to be the origin of conversion from the spin of a paraxial\nLaguerre-Gaussian beam into the orbital angular momentum of the focused beam\nthrough a high numerical aperture.\n", "  It is shown that the momentum density of free electromagnetic field splits\ninto two parts.

We prove that if an integrable system has no hyperbolic\nsingularities and its bifurcation diagram has no vertical tangencies, then the\nfibers of the induced singular Lagrangian fibration are connected. The image of\nthis singular Lagrangian fibration is, up to smooth deformations, a planar\nregion bounded by the graphs of two continuous functions. The bifurcation\ndiagram consists of the boundary points in this image plus a countable\ncollection of rank zero singularities, which are contained in the interior of\nthe image. Because it recently has become clear to the mathematics and\nmathematical physics communities that the bifurcation diagram of an integrable\nsystem provides the best framework to study symplectic invariants, this paper\nprovides a setting for studying quantization questions, and spectral theory of\nquantum integrable systems.\n", "  It is shown that the self inductance of a wire loop may be written as a curve\nintegral akin to the Neumann formula for the mutual inductance of two wire\nloops. The only difference is that contributions where the two integration\nvariables get too close to each other must be excluded from the curve integral\nand evaluated in detail. The contributions of these excluded segments depend on\nthe distribution of the current in the cross section of the wire. They add to a\nsimple constant proportional to the wire length. The error of the new\nexpression is of first order in the wire radius if there are sharp corners and\nof second order in the wire radius for smooth wire loops.\n", "  The impulses, cutting entropy functional (EF) measure on trajectories Markov\ndiffusion process, integrate information path functional (IPF) composing\ndiscrete information Bits extracted from observing random process. Each cut\nbrings memory of the cutting entropy, which provides both reduction of the\nprocess entropy and discrete unit of the cutting entropy a Bit. Consequently,\ninformation is memorized entropy cutting in random observations which process\ninteractions. The origin of information associates with anatomy creation of\nimpulse enables both cut entropy and stipulate random process generating\ninformation under the cut. Memory of the impulse cutting time interval freezes\nthe observing events dynamics in information processes. Diffusion process\nadditive functional defines EF reducing it to a regular integral functional.\nCompared to Shannon entropy measure of random state, cutting process on\nseparated states decreases quantity information concealed in the states\ncorrelation holding hidden process information. Infinite dimensional process\ncutoffs integrate finite information in IPF whose information approaches EF\nrestricting process maximal information. Within the impulse reversible\nmicroprocess, conjugated entropy increments are entangling up to the cutoff\nconverting entropy in irreversible information. Extracting maximum of minimal\nimpulse information and transferring minimal entropy between impulses implement\nmaxmin-minimax principle of optimal conversion process entropy to information.\nMacroprocess extremals integrate entropy of microprocess and cutoff information\nof impulses in the IPF information physical process. IPF measures Feller kernel\ninformation. Estimation extracting information confirms nonadditivity of EF\nmeasured process increments.\n", "  The Karin family is a very young asteroid family created by an asteroid\nbreakup 5.8 Myr ago. Since the members of this family probably have not\nexperienced significant orbital or collisional evolution yet, it is possible\nthat they still preserve properties of the original family-forming event in\nterms of their spin state. As we carried out a series of photometric\nobservations of the Karin family asteroids, here we report an analysis result\nof lightcurves including the rotation period of eleven members. The mean\nrotation rate of the Karin family members turned out to be much lower than\nthose of NEAs or smaller MBAs (diameter D<12 km), and even lower than that of\nlarger MBAs (D>130 km). We investigated a correlation between the peak-to-peak\nvariation magnitude reduced to zero solar phase angle and the rotation period\nof the eleven Karin family asteroids, and found a possible trend that elongated\nmembers have lower spin rate, and less elongated members have higher spin rate.\nHowever, this has to be confirmed by another series of future observations.\n", "  In this work we theoretically analyze a circuit QED design where propagating\nquantum microwaves interact with a single artificial atom, a single Cooper pair\nbox. In particular, we derive a master equation in the so-called transmon\nregime, including coherent drives. Inspired by recent experiments, we then\napply the master equation to describe the dynamics in both a two-level and a\nthree-level approximation of the atom. In the two-level case, we also discuss\nhow to measure photon antibunching in the reflected field and how it is\naffected by finite temperature and finite detection bandwidth.\n", "  In this paper, we consider a nonlinear second order equation modelling rocket\nmotion in the gravitational field obstructed by the drag force. The proofs of\nthe main results are based on topological fixed point approach.\n", "  The radio tracking apparatus of the New Horizons spacecraft, currently\ntraveling to the Pluto system where its arrival is scheduled for July 2015,\nshould be able to reach an accuracy of 10 m (range) and 0.1 mm s^-1\n(range-rate) over distances up to 50 au. This should allow to effectively\nconstrain the location of a putative trans-Plutonian massive object, dubbed\nPlanet X (PX) hereafter, whose existence has recently been postulated for a\nvariety of reasons connected with, e.g., the architecture of the Kuiper belt\nand the cometary flux from the Oort cloud. Traditional scenarios involve a\nrock-ice planetoid with mX = 0.7mE at some 100 - 200 au, or a Jovian body with\nmX = 5mJ at about 10,000 - 20,000 au; as a result of our preliminary\nsensitivity analysis, they should be detectable by New Horizons since they\nwould impact its range at a km level or so over a time span six years long.\nConversely, range residuals statistically compatible with zero having an\namplitude of 10 m would imply that PX, if it exists, could not be located at\nless than about 4,500 au (mX = 0.7mE) or 60,000 au (mX = 5mJ), thus making a\ndirect detection quite demanding with the present-day technologies. As a\nconsequence, it would be appropriate to rename such a remote body as Telisto.\nAlso fundamental physics would benefit from this analysis since certain subtle\neffects predicted by MOND for the deep Newtonian regions of our Solar System\nare just equivalent to those of a distant pointlike mass.\n", "  We consider long term average or `ergodic' optimal control poblems with a\nspecial structure: Control is exerted in all directions and the control costs\nare proportional to the square of the norm of the control field with respect to\nthe metric induced by the noise. The long term stochastic dynamics on the\nmanifold will be completely characterized by the long term density $\\rho$ and\nthe long term current density $J$. As such, control problems may be\nreformulated as variational problems over $\\rho$ and $J$. We discuss several\noptimization problems: the problem in which both $\\rho$ and $J$ are varied\nfreely, the problem in which $\\rho$ is fixed and the one in which $J$ is fixed.\nThese problems lead to different kinds of operator problems: linear PDEs in the\nfirst two cases and a nonlinear PDE in the latter case. These results are\nobtained through through variational principle using infinite dimensional\nLagrange multipliers. In the case where the initial dynamics are reversible we\nobtain the result that the optimally controlled diffusion is also\nsymmetrizable. The particular case of constraining the dynamics to be\nreversible of the optimally controlled process leads to a linear eigenvalue\nproblem for the square root of the density process.\n", "  The interplay between geometry, topology and order can lead to geometric\nfrustration that profoundly affects the shape and structure of a curved\nsurface. In this commentary we show how frustration in this context can result\nin the faceting of elastic vesicles. We show that, under the right conditions,\nan assortment of regular and irregular polyhedral structures may be the low\nenergy states of elastic membranes with spherical topology. In particular, we\nshow how topological defects, necessarily present in any crystalline lattice\nconfined to spherical topology, naturally lead to the formation of icosahedra\nin a homogeneous elastic vesicle. Furthermore, we show that introducing\nheterogeneities in the elastic properties, or allowing for non-linear bending\nresponse of a homogeneous system, opens non-trivial pathways to the formation\nof faceted, yet non-icosahedral, structures.\n", "  An algorithm for sampling exactly from the normal distribution is given. The\nalgorithm reads some number of uniformly distributed random digits in a given\nbase and generates an initial portion of the representation of a normal deviate\nin the same base. Thereafter, uniform random digits are copied directly into\nthe representation of the normal deviate. Thus, in contrast to existing\nmethods, it is possible to generate normal deviates exactly rounded to any\nprecision with a mean cost that scales linearly in the precision. The method\nperforms no extended precision arithmetic, calls no transcendental functions,\nand, indeed, uses no floating point arithmetic whatsoever; it uses only simple\ninteger operations. It can easily be adapted to sample exactly from the\ndiscrete normal distribution whose parameters are rational numbers.\n", "  For time projection chambers (TPCs) the accuracy in measurement of the track\ncoordinates along the pad-row direction deteriorates with the drift distance\n(z): Resolution**2 = D**2 * z / N_eff, where D is the diffusion constant and\nN_eff is the effective number of electrons. Experimentally it has been shown\nthat N_eff is smaller than the average number of drift electrons per pad row\n(<N>). In the previous work we estimated N_eff by means of a simple numerical\nsimulation for argon-based gas mixtures, taking into account the diffusion of\nelectrons only in the pad-row direction [1]. The simulation showed that N_eff\ncould be as small as 30% of <N> because of the combined effect of statistical\nfluctuations in the number of drift electrons (N) and in their multiplication\nin avalanches. In this paper, we evaluate the influence of the diffusion normal\nto the pad-row direction on the effective number of electrons. The\nde-clustering of the drift electrons due to the diffusion makes N_eff\ndrift-distance dependent. However, its effect was found to be too small to\nexplain the discrepancy between the values of N_eff measured with two TPC\nprototypes different in size.\n", "  Immersed mechanical resonators are well suited for probing the properties of\nfluids, since the surrounding environment influences the resonant\ncharacteristics of such oscillators in several ways. Quartz tuning forks have\ngained much popularity in recent years as the resonators of choice for studies\nof liquid helium. They have many superior properties when compared to other\noscillating bodies conventionally used for this purpose, such as vibrating\nwires. However, the intricate geometry of a tuning fork represents a challenge\nfor analyzing their behavior in a fluid environment - analytical approaches do\nnot carry very far. In this article the characteristics of immersed quartz\ntuning fork resonators are studied by numerical simulations. We account for the\ncompressibility of the medium, that is acoustic phenomena, and neglect\nviscosity, with the aim to realisticallymodel the oscillator response in\nsuperfluid helium. The significance of different tuning fork shapes is studied.\nAcoustic emission in infinite medium and acoustic resonances in confined\nvolumes are investigated. The results can aid in choosing a quartz tuning fork\nwith suitable properties for experiments, as well as interpreting measured\ndata.\n", "  We numerically investigate the effect of in-plane anisotropic Fermi surface\n(FS) on the flux-flow resistivity $\\rho_{\\rm f}$ under rotating magnetic field\non the basis of the quasiclassical Green's function method. We demonstrate that\none can detect the phase in pairing potential of Cooper pair through the\nfield-angular dependence of $\\rho_{\\rm f}$ even if the FS has in-plane\nanisotropy. In addition, we point out one can detect the gap-node directions\nirrespective of the FS anisotropy by measuring $\\rho_{\\rm f}$ under rotating\nfield.\n", "  Logarithmic representations of the bordism category are considered as a\nframework for capturing a class of additive invariants characterising\nReidemeister torsions.\n", "  By the Moutard transformation method we construct two-dimensional Schrodinger\noperators with real smooth potential decaying at infinity and with a multiple\npositive eigenvalue. These potentials are rational functions of spatial\nvariables and their sines and cosines.\n", "  Regular colored graphs are dual representations of pure colored D-dimensional\ncomplexes. These graphs can be classified with respect to an integer, their\ndegree, much like maps are characterized by the genus. We analyse the structure\nof regular colored graphs of fixed positive degree and perform their exact and\nasymptotic enumeration. In particular we show that the generating function of\nthe family of graphs of fixed degree is an algebraic series with a positive\nradius of convergence, independant of the degree. We describe the singular\nbehavior of this series near its dominant singularity, and use the results to\nestablish the double scaling limit of colored tensor models.\n", "  We investigate the sensitivity with which the temperature and the chemical\npotential characterizing quantum gases can be measured. We calculate the\ncorresponding quantum Fisher information matrices for both fermionic and\nbosonic gases. For the latter, particular attention is devoted to the situation\nclose to the Bose-Einstein condensation transition, which we examine not only\nfor the standard scenario in three dimensions, but also for generalized\ncondensation in lower dimensions, where the bosons condense in a subspace of\nHilbert space instead of a unique ground state, as well as condensation at\nfixed volume or fixed pressure. We show that Bose Einstein condensation can\nlead to sub-shot noise sensitivity for the measurement of the chemical\npotential. We also examine the influence of interactions on the sensitivity in\nthree different models, and show that mean-field and contact interactions\ndeteriorate the sensitivity but only slightly for experimentally accessible\nweak interactions.\n", "  We construct and investigate an infrared-improved soft-wall AdS/QCD model for\nmesons. Both linear confinement and chiral symmetry breaking of low energy QCD\nare well characterized in such an infrared-improved soft-wall AdS/QCD model.\nThe model enables us to obtain a more consistent numerical prediction for the\nmass spectra of resonance scalar, pseudoscalar, vector and axial-vector mesons.\nIn particular, the predicted mass for the lightest ground state scalar meson\nshows a good agreement with the experimental data. The model also provides a\nremarkable check for the Gell-Mann-Oakes-Renner relation and a sensible result\nfor the space-like pion form factor.\n", "  These lecture notes review the theoretical problems associated with\ncoarse-graining the observed inhomogeneous structure of the universe at late\nepochs, of describing average cosmic evolution in the presence of growing\ninhomogeneity, and of relating average quantities to physical observables. In\nparticular, a detailed discussion of the timescape scenario is presented. In\nthis scenario, dark energy is realized as a misidentification of gravitational\nenergy gradients which result from gradients in the kinetic energy of expansion\nof space, in the presence of density and spatial curvature gradients that grow\nlarge with the growth of structure. The phenomenology and observational tests\nof the timescape model are discussed in detail, with updated constraints from\nPlanck satellite data. In addition, recent results on the variation of the\nHubble expansion on < 100/h Mpc scales are discussed. The spherically averaged\nHubble law is significantly more uniform in the rest frame of the Local Group\nof galaxies than in the conventional rest frame assumed for the Cosmic\nMicrowave Background. This unexpected result supports a fundamental revision of\nthe notion of the cosmic rest frame, consistent with the expectations of the\ntimescape scenario.\n", "  This paper analyzes a new self-avoiding (SA) meshwork model using the\ncanonical Monte Carlo simulation technique on lattices that consist of\nconnection-fixed triangles. The Hamiltonian of this model includes a\nself-avoiding potential and a pressure term. The model identifies a\ncrumpled-to-tubule (CT) transition between the crumpled and tubular phases.\nThis is a second-order transition, which occurs when the pressure difference\nbetween the inner and outer sides of the surface is close to zero. We obtain\nthe Flory swelling exponents $\\nu_{{\\rm R}^2}(=\\!D_f/2)$ and $\\bar{\\nu}_{\\rm\nv}$ corresponding to the mean square radius of gyration $R_g^2$ and enclosed\nvolume $V$, where $D_f$ is the fractal dimension. The analysis shows that\n$\\bar{\\nu}_{\\rm v}$ at the transition is almost identical to the one of the\nsmooth phase of previously reported SA model which has no crumpled phase.\n", "  A concentration-saturated helium mixture at the melting pressure consists of\ntwo liquid phases and one or two solid phases. The equilibrium system is\nunivariant, whose properties depend uniquely on temperature. Four coexisting\nphases can exist on singular points, which are called quadruple points. As a\nunivariant system, the melting pressure could be used as a thermometric\nstandard. It would provide some advantages compared to the current reference,\nnamely pure $^3$He, especially at the lowest temperatures below 1 mK. We have\nextended the melting pressure measurements of the concentration-saturated\nhelium mixture from 10 mK to 460 mK. The density of the dilute liquid phase was\nalso recorded. The effect of the equilibrium crystal structure changing from\nhcp to bcc was clearly seen at T=294 mK at the melting pressure P=2.638 MPa. We\nobserved the existence of metastable solid phases around this point. No\nevidence was found for the presence of another, disputed, quadruple point at\naround 400 mK. The experimental results agree well with our previous\ncalculations at low temperatures, but deviate above 200 mK.\n", "  Scope of the present work is to frame into a rigorous, quantitative scaffold\n- stemmed from stochastic process theory - two sets of experiments designed to\ninfer the spontaneous organization of leukocytes against cancer cells, namely\nmice splenocytes vs. B16 mouse tumor cells, and embedded in an \"ad hoc\"\nmicrofluidic environment developed on a LabOnChip technology. In the former,\nsplenocytes from knocked out (KO) mice engineered to silence the transcription\nfactor IRF-8, crucial for the development and function of several immune\npopulations, were used. In this case lymphocytes and cancer cells exhibited a\npoor reciprocal exchange, resulting in the inability of coordinating or\nmounting an effective immune response against melanoma. In the second class of\ntests, wild type (WT) splenocytes were able to interact with and to coordinate\na response against the tumor cells through physical interaction. The\nenvironment where cells moved was built of by two different chambers,\ncontaining respectively melanoma cells and splenocytes, connected by capillary\nmigration channels allowing leucocytes to migrate from their chamber toward the\nmelanoma one. We collected and analyzed data on the motility of the cells and\nfound that the first ensemble of IRF-8 KO cells performed pure uncorrelated\nrandom walks, while WT splenocytes were able to make singular drifted random\nwalks, that, averaged over the ensemble of cells, collapsed on a straight\nballistic motion for the system as a whole. At a finer level of investigation,\nwe found that IRF-8 KO splenocytes moved rather uniformly since their step\nlengths were exponentially distributed, while WT counterpart displayed a\nqualitatively broader motion as their step lengths along the direction of the\nmelanoma were log-normally distributed.\n", "  By extracting the permittivity of monolayer MoS2 from experiments, the\noptical absorption of monolayer MoS2 prepared on top of one-dimensional\nphotonic crystal (1DPC) or metal films is investigated theoretically. The 1DPC\nand metal films act as resonant back reflectors that can enhance absorption of\nmonolayer MoS2 substantially over a broad spectral range due to the Fabry-Perot\ncavity effect. The absorption of monolayer MoS2 can also be tuned by varying\neither the distance between the monolayer MoS2 and the back reflector or the\nthickness of the cover layers.\n", "  We consider the questions connected with the Hamiltonian properties of the\nWhitham equations in case of several spatial dimensions. An essential point of\nour approach here is a connection of the Hamiltonian structure of the Whitham\nsystem with the finite-dimensional Poisson bracket defined on the space of\nperiodic or quasi-periodic solutions. From our point of view, this approach\ngives a possibility to construct the Hamiltonian structure of the Whitham\nequations under minimal requirements on the properties of the initial system.\nThe Poisson bracket for the Whitham system can be considered here as a\ndeformation of the finite-dimensional bracket with the aid of the Dubrovin -\nNovikov procedure of bracket averaging. At the end, we consider the examples\nwhere the constructions of the paper play an essential role for the\nconstruction of the Poisson bracket for the Whitham system.\n", "  Using a quantum version of the Bell-Ziv-Zakai bound, I derive a Heisenberg\nlimit to multiparameter estimation for any Gaussian prior probability density.\nThe mean-square error lower bound is shown to have a universal quadratic\nscaling with respect to a quantum resource, such as the average photon number\nin the case of optical phase estimation, suitably weighted by the prior\ncovariance matrix.\n", "  A linearly polarized laser beam acquires its circular polarization by\ninteracting with a neutrino beam for the reason that the gauge-couplings of\nleft-handed neutrinos are parity-violated. Based on this phenomena, we study\nthe oscillations of active and sterile neutrinos in short baseline neutrino\nexperiments. Using the total fluxes of active and sterile neutrinos in the\n$3+1$ framework, we show that the rate of generating circular polarization\noscillates as a function of the distance $L$ neutrinos propagating from the\nsource to the detector. By measuring such oscillation, one can possibly\ndetermine the mixing amplitudes of active and sterile neutrinos and their\nsquared-mass difference.\n", "  We apply stochastic process theory to the analysis of immigrant integration.\nUsing a unique and detailed data set from Spain, we study the relationship\nbetween local immigrant density and two social and two economic immigration\nquantifiers for the period 1999-2010. As opposed to the classic time-series\napproach, by letting immigrant density play the role of \"time\", and the\nquantifier the role of \"space\" it become possible to analyze the behavior of\nthe quantifiers by means of continuous time random walks. Two classes of\nresults are obtained. First we show that social integration quantifiers evolve\nfollowing pure diffusion law, while the evolution of economic quantifiers\nexhibit ballistic dynamics. Second we make predictions of best and worst case\nscenarios taking into account large local fluctuations. Our stochastic process\napproach to integration lends itself to interesting forecasting scenarios\nwhich, in the hands of policy makers, have the potential to improve political\nresponses to integration problems. For instance, estimating the standard\nfirst-passage time and maximum-span walk reveals local differences in\nintegration performance for different immigration scenarios. Thus, by\nrecognizing the importance of local fluctuations around national means, this\nresearch constitutes an important tool to assess the impact of immigration\nphenomena on municipal budgets and to set up solid multi-ethnic plans at the\nmunicipal level as immigration pressure build.\n", "  We present and show the features of the FRUITY database, an interactive\nweb-based interface devoted to the nucleosynthesis in AGB stars. We describe\nthe current available set of AGB models (largely expanded with respect to the\noriginal one) with masses in the range 1.3<=M/M_SUN<=3.0 and metallicities\n-2.15<=[Fe/H]<=+0.15. We illustrate the details of our s-process surface\ndistributions and we compare our results to observations. Moreover, we\nintroduce a new set of models where the effects of rotation are taken into\naccount. Finally, we shortly describe next planned upgrades.\n", "  We introduce a phenomenological theory of dislocation motion appropriate for\ntwo dimensional lattices. A coarse grained description is proposed that\ninvolves as primitive variables local lattice rotation and Burgers vector\ndensities along distinguished slip systems of the lattice. We then use symmetry\nconsiderations to propose phenomenological equations for both defect energies\nand their dissipative motion. As a consequence, the model includes explicit\ndependences on the local state of lattice orientation, and allows for\ndifferential defect mobilities along distinguished directions. Defect densities\nand lattice rotation need to determined self consistently and we show specific\nresults for both square and hexagonal lattices. Within linear response,\ndissipative equations of motion for the defect densities are derived which\ncontain defect mobilities that depend nonlocally on defect distribution.\n", "  We show that a formalism proposed by Creutz to evaluate Grassmann integrals\nprovides an algorithm of complexity $O(2^n n^3)$ to compute the generating\nfunction for the sum of the permanental minors of a matrix of order $n$. This\nalgorithm improves over the Brualdi-Ryser formula, whose complexity is at least\n$O(2^{\\frac{5n}{2}})$. In the case of a banded matrix with band width $w$ and\nrank $n$ the complexity is $O(2^{min(2w, n)} (w + 1) n^2)$. Related algorithms\nfor the matching and independence polynomials of graphs are presented.\n", "  We consider statistical-mechanical models for spin systems built on\nhierarchical structures, which provide a simple example of non-mean-field\nframework. We show that the coupling decay with spin distance can give rise to\npeculiar features and phase diagrams much richer that their mean-field\ncounterpart. In particular, we consider the Dyson model, mimicking\nferromagnetism in lattices, and we prove the existence of a number of\nmeta-stabilities, beyond the ordered state, which get stable in the\nthermodynamic limit. Such a feature is retained when the hierarchical structure\nis coupled with the Hebb rule for learning, hence mimicking the modular\narchitecture of neurons, and gives rise to an associative network able to\nperform both as a serial processor as well as a parallel processor, depending\ncrucially on the external stimuli and on the rate of interaction decay with\ndistance; however, those emergent multitasking features reduce the network\ncapacity with respect to the mean-field counterpart. The analysis is\naccomplished through statistical mechanics, graph theory, signal-to-noise\ntechnique and numerical simulations in full consistency. Our results shed light\non the biological complexity shown by real networks, and suggest future\ndirections for understanding more realistic models.\n", "  In this paper we introduce and investigate the statistical mechanics of\nhierarchical neural networks: First, we approach these systems \\`a la Mattis,\nby thinking at the Dyson model as a single-pattern hierarchical neural network\nand we discuss the stability of different retrievable states as predicted by\nthe related self-consistencies obtained from a mean-field bound and from a\nbound that bypasses the mean-field limitation. The latter is worked out by\nproperly reabsorbing fluctuations of the magnetization related to higher levels\nof the hierarchy into effective fields for the lower levels. Remarkably, mixing\nAmit's ansatz technique (to select candidate retrievable states) with the\ninterpolation procedure (to solve for the free energy of these states) we prove\nthat (due to gauge symmetry) the Dyson model accomplishes both serial and\nparallel processing. One step forward, we extend this scenario toward multiple\nstored patterns by implementing the Hebb prescription for learning within the\ncouplings. This results in an Hopfield-like networks constrained on a\nhierarchical topology, for which, restricting to the low storage regime (where\nthe number of patterns grows at most logarithmical with the amount of neurons),\nwe prove the existence of the thermodynamic limit for the free energy and we\ngive an explicit expression of its mean field bound and of the related improved\nbound\n", "  Recent experimental breakthroughs have finally allowed to implement in-vitro\nreaction kinetics (the so called {\\em enzyme based logic}) which code for\ntwo-inputs logic gates and mimic the stochastic AND (and NAND) as well as the\nstochastic OR (and NOR). This accomplishment, together with the already-known\nsingle-input gates (performing as YES and NOT), provides a logic base and paves\nthe way to the development of powerful biotechnological devices. The\ninvestigation of this field would enormously benefit from a self-consistent,\npredictive, theoretical framework. Here we formulate a complete statistical\nmechanical description of the Monod-Wyman-Changeaux allosteric model for both\nsingle and double ligand systems, with the purpose of exploring their practical\ncapabilities to express logical operators and/or perform logical operations.\nMixing statistical mechanics with logics, and quantitatively our findings with\nthe available biochemical data, we successfully revise the concept of\ncooperativity (and anti-cooperativity) for allosteric systems, with particular\nemphasis on its computational capabilities, the related ranges and scaling of\nthe involved parameters and its differences with classical cooperativity (and\nanti-cooperativity).\n", "  We describe the action of the (Mobius) inversion on the data of the\nWeierstrass representation of surfaces in the three-space and show that the\nMoutard transformation of two-dimensional Dirac operators has a geometrical\nmeaning: it maps the potential $U$ of a surface $S$ into the potential of its\ninversion.\n", "  We present a comprehensive analysis of salt transport and overlimiting\ncurrents in a microchannel during concentration polarization. We have carried\nout full numerical simulations of the coupled Poisson-Nernst-Planck-Stokes\nproblem governing the transport and rationalized the behaviour of the system. A\nremarkable outcome of the investigations is the discovery of strong couplings\nbetween bulk advection and the surface current; without a surface current, bulk\nadvection is strongly suppressed. The numerical simulations are supplemented by\nanalytical models valid in the long channel limit as well as in the limit of\nnegligible surface charge. By including the effects of diffusion and advection\nin the diffuse part of the electric double layers, we extend a recently\npublished analytical model of overlimiting current due to surface conduction.\n", "  We present an explicit example of a fast decaying solution to the modified\nNovikov--Veselov equation with a one-point singularity in the space-time. It is\nconstructed by using the geometrical interpretation of the Moutard\ntransformation of solutions to this equation and the Enneper minimal surface.\n", "  We present a numerical study of thermoviscous effects on the acoustic\nstreaming flow generated by an ultrasound standing-wave resonance in a long\nstraight microfluidic channel containing a Newtonian fluid. These effects enter\nprimarily through the temperature and density dependence of the fluid\nviscosity. The resulting magnitude of the streaming flow is calculated and\ncharacterized numerically, and we find that even for thin acoustic boundary\nlayers, the channel height affects the magnitude of the streaming flow. For the\nspecial case of a sufficiently large channel height we have successfully\nvalidated our numerics with analytical results from 2011 by Rednikov and Sadhal\nfor a single planar wall. We analyze the time-averaged energy transport in the\nsystem and the time-averaged second-order temperature perturbation of the\nfluid. Finally, we have made three main changes in our previously published\nnumerical scheme to improve the numerical performance: (i) The time-averaged\nproducts of first-order variables in the time-averaged second-order equations\nhave been recast as flux densities instead of as body forces. (ii) The order of\nthe finite element basis functions has been increased in an optimal manner.\n(iii) Based on the International Association for the Properties of Water and\nSteam (IAPWS 1995, 2008, and 2011), we provide accurate polynomial fits in\ntemperature for all relevant thermodynamic and transport parameters of water in\nthe temperature range from 10 C to 50 C.\n", "  We present a theoretical expression for the acoustic interaction force\nbetween small spherical particles suspended in an ideal fluid exposed to an\nexternal acoustic wave. The acoustic interaction force is the part of the\nacoustic radiation force on one given particle involving the scattered waves\nfrom the other particles. The particles, either compressible liquid droplets or\nelastic microspheres, are considered to be much smaller than the acoustic\nwavelength. In this so-called Rayleigh limit, the acoustic interaction forces\nbetween the particles are well approximated by gradients of pair-interaction\npotentials with no restriction on the inter-particle distance. The theory is\napplied to studies of the acoustic interaction force on a particle suspension\nin either standing or traveling plane waves. The results show aggregation\nregions along the wave propagation direction, while particles may attract or\nrepel each other in the transverse direction. In addition, a mean-field\napproximation is developed to describe the acoustic interaction force in an\nemulsion of oil droplets in water.\n", "  A construction of blowing up solutions to the modified Novikov-Veselov\nequation is proposed. It is based on the Moutard transformation of\ntwo-dimensional Dirac operators and its geometrical interpretation via surface\ngeometry. An explicit example of such a solution constructed by using the\nEnneper minimal surface is discussed in detail. This example was briefly\nannounced in arXiv:1408.4723.\n", "  We propose a scheme of searches for the Abelian $Z'$ gauge boson in the\nDrell-Yan process at $\\sqrt{S}=1.96$ TeV. We base our considerations on\nrenor\\-ma\\-li\\-za\\-tion-group relations between the $Z'$ couplings to\nstandard-model fermions. Considering the range of energies near the $Z$-boson\npeak, namely $66-116$ GeV for the invariant mass of a leptonic pair, we propose\nan integration scheme to construct two-parametric observables suitable for $Z'$\nsearches in the $p\\bar{p} \\to l^+ l^-$ scattering. The observables allow to\nconstrain the $Z'$ vector and axial-vector couplings to SM fermions in a\ngeneral phenomenological parameterization with non-universal $Z'$ interactions\nwith fermion generations. We also consider the cases of generation-universal\n$Z'$ boson and leptophobic $Z'$ boson, and show that one-parametric observables\nexist for these scenarios. The research is aimed to supplement direct searches\nfor $Z'$ as an on-shell state in a specific set of new-physics models.\n", "  The half-supersymmetric Wilson loop in $\\mathcal N=4$ SYM is arguably the\ncentral non-local operator in the AdS/CFT correspondence. On the field theory\nside, the vacuum expectation values of Wilson loops in arbitrary\nrepresentations of $SU(N)$ are captured to all orders in perturbation theory by\na Gaussian matrix model. Of prominent interest are the $k$-symmetric and\n$k$-antisymmetric representations, whose gravitational description is given in\nterms of D3- and D5-branes, respectively, with fluxes in their world volumes.\nAt leading order in $N$ and $\\lambda$ the agreement in both cases is exact. In\nthis note we explore the structure of the next-to-leading order correction in\nthe matrix model and compare with existing string theory calculations. We find\nagreement in the functional dependence on $k$ but a mismatch in the numerical\ncoefficients.\n", "  We show that motion and gravity affect the precision of quantum clocks. We\nconsider a localised quantum field as a fundamental model of a quantum clock\nmoving in spacetime and show that its state is modified due to changes in\nacceleration. By computing the quantum Fisher information we determine how\nrelativistic motion modifies the ultimate bound in the precision of the\nmeasurement of time. While in the absence of motion the squeezed vacuum is the\nideal state for time estimation, we find that it is highly sensitive to the\nmotion-induced degradation of the quantum Fisher information. We show that\ncoherent states are generally more resilient to this degradation and that in\nthe case of very low initial number of photons, the optimal precision can be\neven increased by motion. These results can be tested with current technology\nby using superconducting resonators with tunable boundary conditions.\n", "  We consider a particle performing a stochastic motion on a one-dimensional\nlattice with jump widths distributed according to a power-law with exponent\n$\\mu + 1$. Assuming that the walker moves in the presence of a distribution\n$a(x)$ of targets (traps) depending on the spatial coordinate $x$, we study the\nprobability that the walker will eventually find any target (will eventually be\ntrapped). We focus on the case of power-law distributions $a(x) \\sim\nx^{-\\alpha}$ and we find that as long as $\\mu < \\alpha$ there is a finite\nprobability that the walker will never be trapped, no matter how long the\nprocess is. This analytical result, valid on infinite chains, is corroborated\nby numerical simulations which also evidence the emergence of slow searching\n(trapping) times in finite-size system. The extension of this finding to\nhigher-dimensional structures is also discussed.\n", "  Polar coding is a method for communication over noisy classical channels\nwhich is provably capacity-achieving and has an efficient encoding and\ndecoding. Recently, this method has been generalized to the realm of quantum\ninformation processing, for tasks such as classical communication, private\nclassical communication, and quantum communication. In the present work, we\napply the polar coding method to network quantum information theory, by making\nuse of recent advances for related classical tasks. In particular, we consider\nproblems such as the compound multiple access channel and the quantum\ninterference channel. The main result of our work is that it is possible to\nachieve the best known inner bounds on the achievable rate regions for these\ntasks, without requiring a so-called quantum simultaneous decoder. Thus, our\nwork paves the way for developing network quantum information theory further\nwithout requiring a quantum simultaneous decoder.\n", "  Socio-economic inequalities are manifested in different aspects of our social\nlife. We discuss various aspects, beginning with the evolutionary and\nhistorical origins, and discussing the major issues from the social and\neconomic point of view. The subject has attracted scholars from across various\ndisciplines, including physicists, who bring in a unique perspective to the\nfield. The major attempts to analyze the results, address the causes, and\nunderstand the origins using statistical tools and statistical physics concepts\nare discussed.\n", "  Recent measurements of the Cosmic Microwave Background $B$-mode polarization\npower spectrum by the BICEP2 and POLARBEAR experiments have demonstrated new\nprecision tools for probing fundamental physics. Regardless of origin, the fact\nthat we can detect sub-$\\mu$K CMB polarization represents a tremendous\ntechnological breakthrough. Yet more information may be latent in the CMB's\npolarization pattern. Because of its tensorial nature, CMB polarization may\nalso reveal parity-violating physics via a detection of cosmic polarization\nrotation. Although current CMB polarimeters are sensitive enough to measure one\ndegree-level polarization rotation with $>5\\sigma$ statistical significance,\nthey lack the ability to differentiate this effect from a systematic\ninstrumental polarization rotation. Here, we motivate the search for cosmic\npolarization rotation from current CMB data as well as independent radio galaxy\nand quasar polarization measurements. We argue that an improvement in\ncalibration accuracy would allow the precise measurement of parity- and\nLorentz-violating effects. We describe the CalSat space-based polarization\ncalibrator that will provide stringent control of systematic polarization angle\ncalibration uncertainties to $0.05^\\circ$ -- an order of magnitude improvement\nover current CMB polarization calibrators. CalSat-based calibration could be\nused with current CMB polarimeters searching for $B$-mode polarization,\neffectively turning them into probes of cosmic parity violation, i.e. without\nthe need to build dedicated instruments.\n", "  We provide the reformulations of Yang-Mills theories in terms of gauge\ninvariant metric-like variables in three and four dimensions. The\nreformulations are used to analyze the dimension two gluon condensate and give\ngauge invariant descriptions of gluon polarization. In three dimensions, we\nobtain a non-zero dimension two gluon condensate by one loop computation, whose\nvalue is similar to the square of photon mass in the Schwinger model. In four\ndimensions, we obtain a Lagrangian with the dual property, which shares the\nsimilar but different property with the dual superconductor scenario. We also\nmake discussions on the effectiveness of one loop approximation.\n", "  We consider a realistic model, i.e., ultracold atoms in a driven optical\nlattice, to realize phase space crystals [Phys. Rev. Lett. 111, 205303 (2013)].\nThe corresponding lattice structure in phase space is more complex and contains\nrich physics. A phase space lattice differs fundamentally from a lattice in\nreal space, because its coordinate system, i.e., phase space, has a\nnoncommutative geometry, which naturally provides an artificial gauge\n(magnetic) field. We study the behavior of the quasienergy band structure as\nfunction of the artificial magnetic field and investigate the thermal\nproperties. Synthesizing lattice structures in phase space is not only a new\nway to create artificial lattice in experiments but also provides a platform to\nstudy the intriguing phenomena of driven systems far away from equilibrium.\n", "  Many experiments can be interpreted in terms of random processes operating\naccording to some internal protocols. When experiments are costly or cannot be\nrepeated only one or a few finite samples are available. In this paper we study\ndata generated by pseudo-random computer experiments operating according to\nparticular internal protocols. We show that the standard statistical analysis\nperformed on a sample, containing 100000 data points or more, may sometimes be\nhighly misleading and statistical errors largely underestimated. Our results\nconfirm in a dramatic way the dangers of standard asymptotic statistical\ninference if a sample is not homogenous. We demonstrate that analyzing various\nsubdivisions of samples by multiple chi-square tests and chi-square frequency\ngraphs is very effective in detecting sample inhomogeneity. Therefore to assure\ncorrectness of the statistical inference the above mentioned chi-square tests\nand other non-parametric sample homogeneity tests should be incorporated in any\nstatistical analysis of experimental data. If such tests are not performed the\nreported conclusions and estimates of the errors cannot be trusted.\n", "  We present a scheme for engineering the joint spectrum of photon pairs\ncreated via spontaneous parametric down conversion. Our method relies on\ncustomizing the poling configuration of a quasi-phase-matched crystal. We use\nsimulated annealing to find an optimized poling configuration which allows\nalmost arbitrary shaping of the crystal's phase-matching function. This has\ndirect application in the creation of pure single photons---currently one of\nthe most important goals of single-photon quantum optics. We describe the\ngeneral algorithm and provide code, written in C++, that outputs an optimized\npoling configuration given specific experimental parameters.\n", "  Superqubits provide a supersymmetric generalisation of the conventional qubit\nin quantum information theory. After a review of their current status, we\naddress the problem of generating entangled states. We introduce the global\nunitary supergroup $\\text{UOSp}((3^n+1)/2 | (3^n-1)/2)$ for an $n$-superqubit\nsystem, which contains as a subgroup the local unitary supergroup\n$[\\text{UOSp}(2|1)]^n$. While for $4>n>1$ the bosonic subgroup in\n$\\text{UOSp}((3^n+1)/2 | (3^n-1)/2)$ does not contain the standard global\nunitary group $\\text{SU}(2^n)$, it does have an\n$\\text{USp}(2^n)\\subset\\text{SU}(2^n)$ subgroup which acts transitively on the\n$n$-qubit subspace, as required for consistency with the conventional\nmulti-qubit framework. For two superqubits the $\\text{UOSp}(5|4)$ action is\nused to generate entangled states from the \"bosonic\" separable state\n$|00\\rangle$.\n", "  Entanglement entropy of gauge fields is calculated using the partition\nfunction in curved spacetime with a boundary. We derive a Gibbons-Hawking-like\nterm from a Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) action and a Wald-entropy-like\ncodimension-2 surface term is produced. It is further suggested that boundary\ndegrees of freedom localized on the entanglement surface generated from the\ngauge redundancy could be used to resolve a subtle mismatch in a universal\nconformal anomaly- entanglement entropy relation.\n", "  The conferences on \"Strongly Coupled Coulomb Systems\" (SCCS) arose from the\n\"Strongly Coupled Plasmas\" meetings, inaugurated in 1977. The progress in SCCS\ntheory is reviewed in an `author-centered' frame to limit its scope. Our\nefforts, i.e., with Fran\\c{c}ois Perrot, sought to apply density functional\ntheory (DFT) to SCCS calculations. DFT was then poised to become the major\ncomputational scheme for condensed matter physics. The ion-sphere models of\nSalpeter and others evolved into useful average-atom models for finite-$T$\nCoulomb systems, as in Lieberman's Inferno code. We replaced these by\ncorrelation-sphere models that exploit the description of matter via density\nfunctionals linked to pair-distributions. These methods provided practical\ncomputational means for studying strongly interacting electron-ion Coulomb\nsystems like warm-dense matter (WDM). The staples of SCCS are wide-ranged,\nviz., equation of state, plasma spectroscopy, opacity (absorption, emission),\nscattering, level shifts, transport properties, e.g., electrical and heat\nconductivity, laser- and shock- created plasmas, their energy relaxation and\ntransient properties etc. These calculations need pseudopotentials and\nexchange-correlation functionals applicable to finite-$T$ Coulomb systems that\nmay be used in ab initio codes, molecular dynamics, etc. The search for simpler\ncomputational schemes has proceeded via proposals for orbital-free DFT,\nstatistical potentials, classical maps of quantum systems using classical\nschemes like HNC to include strong coupling effects (CHNC). Laughlin's\nclassical plasma map for the fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) is a seminal\nexample where we report new results for graphene.\n", "  It is shown that in the state space of a quantum particle involved in a\none-dimensional completed scattering (OCS) there is a superselection rule (SSR)\ninduced by the dichotomous physical context that determines the properties of a\nquantum ensemble of scattering particles in the disjoint spatial regions\nlocated on the different sides of the potential barrier at asymptotically large\ndistances from it. At the initial stage of the OCS this context is associated,\nin the general case, with two sources of particles located on the different\nsides of the barrier; and at the final stage it is associated, in the general\ncase, with two particle detectors located on different sides of the barrier.\nThe role of a superselection operator is played by the Pauli matrix $\\sigma_3$\nthat divides the space of in- and out-asymptotes into two coherent sectors. In\nthe course of the OCS, its unitary quantum dynamics crosses these sectors. In\nparticular, in the scattering problem with one source and two detectors, a pure\ninitial state of a particle is converted into a mixed final state. According to\nthis rule, the OCS is a complex quantum process consisting of two coherent\nsubprocesses -- transmission and reflection; the average value of any\nobservable as well as characteristic times can be defined for the subprocesses\nonly. It is shown that the quantum dynamics of both subprocesses at all stages\nof scattering is uniquely determined by the initial state of the whole ensemble\nof particles and by the final states of transmitted and reflected particles.\n", "  The deep trapping gate pixel device was described recently as an alternative\nto CMOS 3T pixel. The feasibilty of this device was studied with technological\nand transport simulations used in classical electron devices and process\ndesign. A buried gate containing localized deep level centers (Deep Trapping\nGate or DTG) is the key for the operation of this field effect pixel detector.\nThis can be made with deep levels or a quantum box. This buried gate can\nmodulates the drain-source current, the same way the upper gate does. This\nprinciple was evaluated with realistic simulations physical parameters and this\nshows that the signal magnitude is sufficient for an energy deposition of a\nMinimum Ionizing Particle within a limited silicon thickness (a few microns).\nWe will study here the potential techniques usable for the fabrication of the\ndevice with their drawbacks, advantages and limits. The first technique\nintroduced is impurity implantation, followed by annealing. The problems\nrelated to the control of the defects in the DTG will be examined in the light\nof recent work on ion implantation. As an alternative recent work on quantum\ndots opens the possibility to the use Ge dots as a DTG. Ion implantation can\nagain be used with some limitations. As an alternative to ion implantation an\nepitaxial DTG could be fabricated using standard techniques. The first\nconclusion of this study is that all the established techniques necessary for\nthe development of the DTG pixel can reasonably be successful because the\nrelated bottlenecks may be overcome. The deep levels concentration in the DTG\n(above 10^18 cm-3) is higher than the concentration of radiation induced\ndefects for integrated fluences lower than 1x10^16 cm-3.\n", "  A generalization of the geometric measure of quantum discord is introduced in\nthis article, based on Hellinger distance. Our definition has virtues of\ncomputability and independence of local measurement. In addition it also does\nnot suffer from the recently raised critiques about quantum discord. The exact\nresult can be obtained for bipartite pure states with arbitrary levels, which\nis completely determined by the Schmidt decomposition. For bipartite mixed\nstates the exact result can also be found for a special case. Furthermore the\ngeneralization into multipartite case is direct. It is shown that it can be\nevaluated exactly when the measured state is invariant under permutation or\ntranslation. In addition the detection of quantum phase transition is also\ndiscussed for Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick and Dicke model.\n", "  We investigate the unfolded formulation of bosonic Lorentz tensor fields of\narbitrary spin in $AdS_3$ containing a parity breaking mass parameter. They\ninclude deformations of the linearisations of the Prokushkin--Vasiliev higher\nspin theory around its critical points. They also provide unfolded formulations\nof linearized topologically massive higher spin fields including their critical\nversions. The gauge invariant degrees of freedom are captured by infinite\ntowers of zero forms. We also introduce two inequivalent sets of gauge\npotentials given by trace constrained Fronsdal fields and trace unconstrained\nmetric-like fields.\n", "  The dual formulation of planar N = 4 super-Yang-Mills scattering amplitudes\nmakes manifest that the integrand has only logarithmic singularities and no\npoles at infinity. Recently, Arkani-Hamed, Bourjaily, Cachazo and Trnka\nconjectured the same singularity properties hold to all loop orders in the\nnonplanar sector as well. Here we conjecture that to all loop orders these\nconstraints give us the key analytic information contained in dual conformal\nsymmetry. We also conjecture that to all loop orders, while N = 8 supergravity\nhas poles at infinity, at least at four points it has only logarithmic\nsingularities at finite locations. We provide nontrivial evidence for these\nconjectures. For the three-loop four-point N = 4 super-Yang-Mills amplitude, we\nexplicitly construct a complete basis of diagram integrands that has only\nlogarithmic singularities and no poles at infinity. We then express the\ncomplete amplitude in terms of the basis diagrams, with the coefficients\ndetermined by unitarity. We also give examples at three loops showing how to\nmake the logarithmic singularity properties manifest via dlog forms. We give\nadditional evidence at four and five loops supporting the nonplanar logarithmic\nsingularity conjecture. Furthermore, we present a variety of examples\nillustrating that these constraints are more restrictive than dual conformal\nsymmetry. Our investigations show that the singularity structures of planar and\nnonplanar amplitudes in N = 4 super-Yang-Mills are strikingly similar. While it\nis not clear how to extend either dual conformal symmetry or a dual formulation\nto the nonplanar sector, these results suggest that related concepts might\nexist and await discovery. Finally, we describe the singularity structure of N\n= 8 supergravity at three loops and beyond.\n", "  Lenses that can collect the perfect image of an object must restore\npropagative and evanescent waves. However, for efficient information transfer,\ne.g., in compressed sensing, it is often desirable to detect only the fast\nspatial variations of the wave field (carried by evanescent waves), as the one\ncreated by edges or small details. Image processing edge detection algorithms\nperform such operation but they add time and complexity to the imaging process.\nHere, we present a new subwavelength approach that generates an image of only\nthose components of the acoustic field that are equal to or smaller than the\noperating wavelength. The proposed technique converts evanescent waves into\npropagative waves exciting trapped resonances in a waveguide, and it uses\nperiodicity to attenuate the propagative components. This approach achieves\nresolutions about an order of magnitude smaller than the operating wavelength\nand makes it possible to visualize independently edges aligned along different\ndirections.\n", "  The compression of arsenolite (cubic As2O3) has been studied from a joint\nexperimental and theoretical point of view. Experimental X-ray diffraction and\nRaman scattering measurements of this molecular solid at high pressures with\ndifferent pressure-transmitting media have been interpreted with the help of ab\ninitio calculations. Our results confirm arsenolite as one of the softest\nminerals in absence of hydrogen bonding and provide evidence for helium\ntrapping above 3 GPa between adamantane-type As4O6 cages, thus leading to a new\ncompound with stoichiometry He2As4O6. Helium trapping alters all properties of\narsenolite. In particular, pressure-induced amorphization, which occurs in pure\narsenolite above 15 GPa, is impeded when He is trapped between the As4O6 cages;\nthus resulting in a mechanical stability of He2As4O6 beyond 30 GPa. Our work\npaves the way for the modification of the properties of other molecular solids\nby compression depending on their ability to trap relatively small atomic or\nmolecular species and form new compounds. Furthermore, our work suggests that\ncompression of molecular solids with noble gases as helium could result in\nunexpected results compared to other pressure-transmitting media.\n", "  Tensoring two on-shell super Yang-Mills multiplets in dimensions $D\\leq 10$\nyields an on-shell supergravity multiplet, possibly with additional matter\nmultiplets. Associating a (direct sum of) division algebra(s) $\\mathbb{D}$ with\neach dimension $3\\leq D\\leq 10$ we obtain formulae for the algebras\n$\\mathfrak{g}$ and $\\mathfrak{h}$ of the U-duality group $G$ and its maximal\ncompact subgroup $H$, respectively, in terms of the internal global symmetry\nalgebras of each super Yang-Mills theory. We extend our analysis to include\nsupergravities coupled to an arbitrary number of matter multiplets by allowing\nfor non-supersymmetric multiplets in the tensor product.\n", "  We propose angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy of aerosol particles as\nan alternative way to determine the electron mean free path of low energy\nelectrons in solid and liquid materials. The mean free path is obtained from\nfits of simulated photoemission images to experimental ones over a broad range\nof different aerosol particle sizes. The principal advantage of the aerosol\napproach is twofold. Firstly, aerosol photoemission studies can be performed\nfor many different materials, including liquids. Secondly, the size-dependent\nanisotropy of the photoelectrons can be exploited in addition to size-dependent\nchanges in their kinetic energy. These finite size effects depend in different\nways on the mean free path and thus provide more information on the mean free\npath than corresponding liquid jet, thin film, or bulk data. The present\ncontribution is a proof of principle employing a simple model for the\nphotoemission of electrons and preliminary experimental data for potassium\nchloride aerosol particles.\n", "  Assessing quantitatively the state and dynamics of a social system is a very\ndifficult problem. It is of great importance for both practical and theoretical\nreasons such as establishing the efficiency of social action programs,\ndetecting possible community needs or allocating resources. In this paper we\npropose a new general theoretical framework for the study of social complexity,\nbased on the relation of complexity and entropy in combination with\nevolutionary dynamics to asses the dynamics of the system. Imposing the second\nlaw of thermodynamics, we study the conditions under which cooperation emerges\nand demonstrate that it depends of relative importance of local and global\nfitness. As cooperation is a central concept in sustainability, this\nthermodynamic-informational approach allows new insights and means to asses it\nusing the concept of Helmholtz free energy. Finally we introduce a new set of\nequations that consider the more general case where the social system change\nboth in time and space, and relate our findings to sustainability.\n", "  We study the one dimensional periodic derivative nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger\n(DNLS) equation. This is known to be a completely integrable system, in the\nsense that there is an infinite sequence of formal integrals of motion $\\int\nh_k$, $k\\in \\mathbb{Z}_{+}$. In each $\\int h_{2k}$ the term with the highest\nregularity involves the Sobolev norm $\\dot H^{k}(\\mathbb{T})$ of the solution\nof the DNLS equation. We show that a functional measure on $L^2(\\mathbb{T})$,\nabsolutely continuous w.r.t. the Gaussian measure with covariance\n$(\\mathbb{I}+(-\\Delta)^{k})^{-1}$, is associated to each integral of motion\n$\\int h_{2k}$, $k\\geq1$.\n", "  In this work we apply techniques and modus operandi typical of Statistical\nMechanics to a large dataset about key social quantifiers and compare the\nresulting behaviours of five European nations, namely France, Germany, Italy,\nSpain and Switzerland. The social quantifiers considered are $i.$ the evolution\nof the number of autochthonous marriages (i.e. between two natives) within a\ngiven territorial district and $ii.$ the evolution of the number of mixed\nmarriages (i.e. between a native and an immigrant) within a given territorial\ndistrict. Our investigations are twofold. From a theoretical perspective, we\ndevelop novel techniques, complementary to classical methods (e.g. historical\nseries and logistic regression), in order to detect possible collective\nfeatures underlying the empirical behaviours; from an experimental perspective,\nwe evidence a clear outline for the evolution of the social quantifiers\nconsidered. The comparison between experimental results and theoretical\npredictions is excellent and allows speculating that France, Italy and Spain\ndisplay a certain degree of {\\em internal heterogeneity}, that is not found in\nGermany and Switzerland; such heterogeneity, quite mild in France and in Spain,\nis not negligible in Italy and highlights quantitative differences in the\ncustoms of Northern and Southern regions. These findings may suggest the\npersistence of two culturally distinct communities, long-term lasting heritages\nof different and well-established cultures.\n", "  Recently, much attention has been paid to search for Majorana fermions in\nsolid-state systems. Among various proposals there is one based on\nradio-frequency superconducting quantum interference devices (rf-SQUIDs), in\nwhich the appearance of 4$\\pi$-period energy-phase relations is regarded as\nsmoking-gun evidence of Majorana fermion states. Here we report the observation\nof truncated 4$\\pi$-period (i.e., 2$\\pi$-period but fully skewed) oscillatory\npatterns of contact resistance on rf-SQUIDs constructed on the surface of\nthree-dimensional topological insulator Bi$_2$Te$_3$. The results reveal the\nexistence of 1/2 fractional modes of Cooper pairs and the occurrence of parity\nswitchings, both of which are necessary signatures accompanied with the\nformation of Majorana fermion states.\n", "  We report the measurement of the leptonic ($e^{+}e^{-}$) decay channel of the\n$\\phi$(1020) meson in Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}}$ = 200 GeV by the\nSTAR experiment. The transverse momentum ($p_{\\rm T}$) spectrum is measured for\n0.1 $\\le p_{\\rm T} \\le 2.5$ GeV/$c$ at mid-rapidity ($|y|\\le1$). We obtain the\n$p_{\\rm T}$-integrated $\\phi$(1020) mass $M_{\\phi}=1017.7\\pm0.8 (\\rm {stat.})\n\\pm0.9 (\\rm {sys.})$ MeV/$c^{2}$ and width $\\Gamma_{\\phi} = 8.0\\pm 2.5(\\rm\n{stat.}) \\pm 2.3(\\rm {sys.}) \\textrm{MeV/}c^{2}$, which are within\n1.5\\,$\\sigma$ and 1.1\\,$\\sigma$ of the vacuum values, respectively. No\nsignificant difference is observed in the measured $p_{\\rm T}$ spectrum,\n$dN/dy$, or $\\left<p_{\\rm T}\\right>$ of the $\\phi$(1020) meson between the\n$e^{+}e^{-}$ and hadronic ($K^{+}K^{-}$) decay channels as measured by the same\nexperiment. The experimental results are compared to a theoretical model\nincluding medium-modified $\\phi$(1020).\n", "  We calculate analytically the low temperature quasi-particle scattering rate,\nthe conductivity, and the specific heat in weakly disordered metals close to a\nquantum critical point, via the use of a proper fluctuation potential\n$V(q,\\omega)$ between the quasi-particles. We obtain typical Fermi liquid\nresults proportional to $T^2$ and $T$ respectively, with prefactors which\ndiverge as power laws of the control parameter $a$ upon approaching the\ncritical point. The Kadowaki-Woods ratio is shown to be independent of $a$\n(possibly times a logarithmic dependence on $a$) only for the case of\nthree-dimensional ferromagnetic fluctuations. Our results are consistent with\nexperiments on the eight materials CeCoIn$_5$, Sr$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$,\nYbRh$_2$Si$_2$, La$_{2-x}$Ce$_x$CuO$_4$, Tl$_2$Ba$_2$CuO$_{6+x}$, CeAuSb$_2$,\nYbAlB$_4$, and CeRuSi$_2$.\n", "  We report the discovery of a gravitationally lensed hyperluminous infrared\ngalaxy (L_IR~10^13 L_sun) with strong radio emission (L_1.4GHz~10^25 W/Hz) at\nz=2.553. The source was identified in the citizen science project SpaceWarps\nthrough the visual inspection of tens of thousands of iJKs colour composite\nimages of Luminous Red Galaxies (LRGs), groups and clusters of galaxies and\nquasars. Appearing as a partial Einstein ring (r_e~3\") around an LRG at z=0.2,\nthe galaxy is extremely bright in the sub-millimetre for a cosmological source,\nwith the thermal dust emission approaching 1 Jy at peak. The redshift of the\nlensed galaxy is determined through the detection of the CO(3-2) molecular\nemission line with the Large Millimetre Telescope's Redshift Search Receiver\nand through [OIII] and H-alpha line detections in the near-infrared from\nSubaru/IRCS. We have resolved the radio emission with high resolution (300-400\nmas) eMERLIN L-band and JVLA C-band imaging. These observations are used in\ncombination with the near-infrared imaging to construct a lens model, which\nindicates a lensing magnification of ~10x. The source reconstruction appears to\nsupport a radio morphology comprised of a compact (<250 pc) core and more\nextended component, perhaps indicative of an active nucleus and jet or lobe.\n", "  In nanoscale space and pico- to nanoseconds enormous physical, chemical and\nbiological processes take place, while the motions of involved\nparticles/molecules under thermal fluctuations are usually analyzed using the\nconventional theory of diffusive Brownian motion based on both sufficiently\nlong time averaging and assumptions of spherical particle shapes. Here, using\nmolecular dynamics simulations, we show that asymmetrically shaped\nnanoparticles in dilute solutions possess spontaneous directional motion of the\ncenter of mass within a finite time interval. The driving force for this\nunexpected directional motion lies in the imbalance of the interactions\nexperienced by their constituent atoms during the orientation regulation at\ntimescales before the onset of diffusive Brownian motion. Theoretical formulae\nhave been derived to describe the mean displacement and the variance of this\ndirectional motion. Our study potentially takes an important step towards\nestablishing a complete theoretical framework for describing the motions of\nvariously-shaped particles in solutions over all timescales from ballistic to\ndiffusive regime.\n", "  We consider extensive data on Spanish international trades and population\ncomposition and, through statistical-mechanics and graph-theory driven\nanalysis, we unveil that the social network made of native and foreign-born\nindividuals plays a role in the evolution and in the diversification of trades.\nIndeed, migrants naturally provide key information on policies and needs in\ntheir native countries, hence allowing firm's holders to leverage transactional\ncosts of exports and duties. As a consequence, international trading is\naffordable for a larger basin of firms and thus results in an increased number\nof transactions, which, in turn, implies a larger diversification of\ninternational traded products. These results corroborate the novel scenario\ndepicted by \"Economical Complexity\", where the pattern of production and trade\nof more developed countries is highly diversified. We also address a central\nquestion in Economics, concerning the existence of a critical threshold for\nmigrants (within a given territorial district) over which they effectively\ncontribute to boost international trades: in our physically-driven picture,\nthis phenomenon corresponds to the emergence of a phase transition and,\ntackling the problem from this perspective, results in a novel successful\nquantitative route. Finally, we can infer that the pattern of interaction\nbetween native and foreign-born population exhibits small-world features as\nsmall diameter, large clustering, and weak ties working as optimal cut-edge, in\ncomplete agreement with findings in \"Social Complexity\".\n", "  We study multiple period states of a two-component unpolarized superfluid\nFermi gas in an optical lattice along the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) to\nBose-Einstein condensate (BEC) crossover. The existence of states whose period\nis a multiple of the lattice spacing is a direct consequence of the non-linear\nbehavior of the gas, which is due to the presence of the order parameter\nassociated with superfluidity. By solving Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations for a\nsuperfluid flow with finite quasimomentum, we find that, in the BCS side of the\ncrossover, the multiple period states can be energetically favorable compared\nto the normal Bloch states and their survival time against dynamical\ninstability drastically increases, suggesting that these states can be\naccessible in current experiments, in sharp contrast to the situation in BECs.\n", "  The electron-transport properties of adatom-graphene system are investigated\nfor different (random, correlated, and ordered) spatial configurations of\nadatoms over different types of high symmetry sites with various adsorption\nheights. K adatoms in monolayer graphene are modeled by the scattering\npotential adapted from the independent self-consistent ab initio calculations.\nThe results are obtained numerically using the quantum-mechanical\nKubo-Greenwood formalism. A band gap may be opened only if ordered adatoms act\nas substitutional atoms, while there is no band gap opening for adatoms acting\nas interstitial atoms. The type of adsorption sites strongly affect the\nconductivity for random and correlated adatoms, but practically does not change\nthe conductivity when they form ordered superstructures with equal periods.\nDepending on electron density and type of adsorption sites, the conductivity\nfor correlated and ordered adatoms is found to be enhanced in dozens of times\nas compared to the cases of their random positions. These the correlation and\nordering effects manifest weaker or stronger depending on whether adatoms act\nas substitutional or interstitial atoms. The conductivity approximately\nlinearly scales with adsorption height of random or correlated adatoms, but\nremains practically unchanged with adequate varying of elevation of ordered\nadatoms. Correlations between electron transport properties and heterogeneous\nelectron transfer kinetics through K-doped graphene and electrolyte interface\nare investigated as well. The ferri-/ferrocyanide redox couple is used as an\nelectrochemical benchmark system. K adsorption of graphene electrode results to\nonly slight suppress of the heterogeneous standard rate constant. Band gap,\nopening for ordered and strongly short-range scatterers, has a strong impact on\nthe dependence of the electrode reaction rate as a function of electrode\npotential.\n", "  Atmospheric chemical disequilibrium has been proposed as a method for\ndetecting extraterrestrial biospheres from exoplanet observations. Chemical\ndisequilibrium is potentially a generalized biosignature since it makes no\nassumptions about particular biogenic gases or metabolisms. Here, we present\nthe first rigorous calculations of the thermodynamic chemical disequilibrium in\nSolar System atmospheres, in which we quantify the available Gibbs energy: the\nGibbs free energy of an observed atmosphere minus that of atmospheric gases\nreacted to equilibrium. The purely gas phase disequilibrium in Earth's\natmosphere is mostly attributable to O2 and CH4. The available Gibbs energy is\nnot unusual compared to other Solar System atmospheres and smaller than that of\nMars. However, Earth's fluid envelope contains an ocean, allowing gases to\nreact with water and requiring a multiphase calculation with aqueous species.\nThe disequilibrium in Earth's atmosphere-ocean system (in joules per mole of\natmosphere) ranges from 20 to 2E6 times larger than the disequilibria of other\natmospheres in the Solar System. Only on Earth is the chemical disequilibrium\nenergy comparable to the thermal energy per mole of atmosphere. Earth's\ndisequilibrium is biogenic, mainly caused by the coexistence of N2, O2 and\nliquid water instead of more stable nitrate. In comparison, the O2-CH4\ndisequilibrium is minor. We identify abiotic processes that cause\ndisequilibrium in the other atmospheres. Our metric requires minimal\nassumptions and could potentially be calculated using observations of exoplanet\natmospheres. However, further work is needed to establish whether thermodynamic\ndisequilibrium is a practical exoplanet biosignature, requiring an assessment\nof false positives, noisy observations, and other detection challenges. Our\nMatlab code and databases for these calculations are available, open source.\n", "  The neutrino detector of the Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO)\nis designed to use 20 kilotons of liquid scintillator and approximately 16,000\n20-inch photomultipliers (PMTs).One of the options is to use the 20-inch R12860\nPMT with high quantum efficiency which has recently been developed by Hamamatsu\nPhotonics. The performance of the newly developed PMT preproduction samples is\nevaluated. The results show that its quantum efficiency is $30\\%$ at $400 nm$.\nIts Peak/Valley (P/V) ratio for the single photoelectron is 4.75 and the dark\ncount rate is $27 kHz$ at the threshold of 3 mV while the gain is at $1 \\times\n10^7$. The transit time spread of a single photoelectron is $2.86 ns$.\nGenerally the performances of this new 20-inch PMT are improved over the old\none of R3600.\n", "  Using the standard Green-Kubo formalism, we determine the shear viscosity\n$\\eta$ of a hot and dense Yukawa-Fermi gas. In particular, we study the effect\nof particle and plasmino excitations on thermal properties of the fermionic\npart of the shear viscosity, and explore the effects of thermal corrections to\nparticle masses on bosonic and fermionic shear viscosities, $\\eta_b$ and\n$\\eta_f$. It turns out that the effects of plasminos on $\\eta_f$ become\nnegligible with increasing (decreasing) temperature (chemical potential).\n", "  Weak measurements have thus far been considered instrumental in the so-called\ndirect measurement of the quantum wavefunction [Nature (London) 474, 188\n(2011)]. Here we show that direct measurement of the wavefunction can be\nobtained by using measurements of arbitrary strength. In particular, in the\ncase of strong measurements, i.e. those in which the coupling between the\nsystem and the measuring apparatus is maximum, we compared the precision and\nthe accuracy of the two methods, by showing that strong measurements outperform\nweak measurements in both for arbitrary quantum states in most cases. We also\ngive the exact expression of the difference between the reconstructed and\noriginal wavefunctions obtained by the weak measurement approach: this will\nallow to define the range of applicability of such method.\n", "  Prediction and control of network dynamics are grand-challenge problems in\nnetwork science. The lack of understanding of fundamental laws driving the\ndynamics of networks is among the reasons why many practical problems of great\nsignificance remain unsolved for decades. Here we study the dynamics of\nnetworks evolving according to preferential attachment, known to approximate\nwell the large-scale growth dynamics of a variety of real networks. We show\nthat this dynamics is Hamiltonian, thus casting the study of complex networks\ndynamics to the powerful canonical formalism, in which the time evolution of a\ndynamical system is described by Hamilton's equations. We derive the explicit\nform of the Hamiltonian that governs network growth in preferential attachment.\nThis Hamiltonian turns out to be nearly identical to graph energy in the\nconfiguration model, which shows that the ensemble of random graphs generated\nby preferential attachment is nearly identical to the ensemble of random graphs\nwith scale-free degree distributions. In other words, preferential attachment\ngenerates nothing but random graphs with power-law degree distribution. The\nextension of the developed canonical formalism for network analysis to richer\ngeometric network models with non-degenerate groups of symmetries may\neventually lead to a system of equations describing network dynamics at small\nscales.\n", "  Graphs are now ubiquitous in almost every field of research. Recently, new\nresearch areas devoted to the analysis of graphs and data associated to their\nvertices have emerged. Focusing on dynamical processes, we propose a fast,\nrobust and scalable framework for retrieving and analyzing recurring patterns\nof activity on graphs. Our method relies on a novel type of multilayer graph\nthat encodes the spreading or propagation of events between successive time\nsteps. We demonstrate the versatility of our method by applying it on three\ndifferent real-world examples. Firstly, we study how rumor spreads on a social\nnetwork. Secondly, we reveal congestion patterns of pedestrians in a train\nstation. Finally, we show how patterns of audio playlists can be used in a\nrecommender system. In each example, relevant information previously hidden in\nthe data is extracted in a very efficient manner, emphasizing the scalability\nof our method. With a parallel implementation scaling linearly with the size of\nthe dataset, our framework easily handles millions of nodes on a single\ncommodity server.\n", "  Separate spin evolution quantum hydrodynamics is generalized to include the\nCoulomb exchange interaction. The Coulomb exchange interaction is considered as\nthe interaction between the spin-down electrons being in the quantum states\noccupied by one electron, giving main contribution in the equilibrium. The\ngeneralized model is applied to study the non-linear spin-electron acoustic\nwaves. Existence of the spin-electron acoustic soliton is demonstrated.\nContributions of the concentration, spin polarization, and exchange interaction\nin the properties of the spin electron acoustic soliton are studied.\n", "  A common statistical situation concerns inferring an unknown distribution\nQ(x) from a known distribution P(y), where X (dimension n), and Y (dimension m)\nhave a known functional relationship. Most commonly, n<m, and the task is\nrelatively straightforward. For example, if Y1 and Y2 are independent random\nvariables, each uniform on [0, 1], one can determine the distribution of X = Y1\n+ Y2; here m=2 and n=1. However, biological and physical situations can arise\nwhere n>m. In general, in the absence of additional information, there is no\nunique solution to Q in those cases. Nevertheless, one may still want to draw\nsome inferences about Q. To this end, we propose a novel maximum entropy\n(MaxEnt) approach that estimates Q(x) based only on the available data, namely,\nP(y). The method has the additional advantage that one does not need to\nexplicitly calculate the Lagrange multipliers. In this paper we develop the\napproach, for both discrete and continuous probability distributions, and\ndemonstrate its validity. We give an intuitive justification as well, and we\nillustrate with examples.\n", "  Many online collaboration networks struggle to gain user activity and become\nself-sustaining due to the ramp-up problem or dwindling activity within the\nsystem. Prominent examples include online encyclopedias such as (Semantic)\nMediaWikis, Question and Answering portals such as StackOverflow, and many\nothers. Only a small fraction of these systems manage to reach self-sustaining\nactivity, a level of activity that prevents the system from reverting to a\nnon-active state. In this paper, we model and analyze activity dynamics in\nsynthetic and empirical collaboration networks. Our approach is based on two\nopposing and well-studied principles: (i) without incentives, users tend to\nlose interest to contribute and thus, systems become inactive, and (ii) people\nare susceptible to actions taken by their peers (social or peer influence).\nWith the activity dynamics model that we introduce in this paper we can\nrepresent typical situations of such collaboration networks. For example,\nactivity in a collaborative network, without external impulses or investments,\nwill vanish over time, eventually rendering the system inactive. However, by\nappropriately manipulating the activity dynamics and/or the underlying\ncollaboration networks, we can jump-start a previously inactive system and\nadvance it towards an active state. To be able to do so, we first describe our\nmodel and its underlying mechanisms. We then provide illustrative examples of\nempirical datasets and characterize the barrier that has to be breached by a\nsystem before it can become self-sustaining in terms of critical mass and\nactivity dynamics. Additionally, we expand on this empirical illustration and\nintroduce a new metric p---the Activity Momentum---to assess the activity\nrobustness of collaboration networks.\n", "  We present the first measurement for helium atoms of the tune-out wavelength\nat which the atomic polarizability vanishes. We utilise a novel, highly\nsensitive technique for precisely measuring the effect of variations in the\ntrapping potential of confined metastable ($2^{3}S_{1}$) helium atoms\nilluminated by a perturbing laser light field. The measured tune-out wavelength\nof 413.0938($9_{Stat.}$)($20_{Syst.}$) nm compares well with the value\npredicted by a theoretical calculation (413.02(9) nm) which is sensitive to\nfinite nuclear mass, relativistic, and quantum electro-dynamic (QED) effects.\nThis provides motivation for more detailed theoretical investigations to test\nQED.\n", "  We propose a realistic scheme to detect the 4D quantum Hall effect using\nultracold atoms. Based on contemporary technology, motion along a synthetic\nfourth dimension can be accomplished through controlled transitions between\ninternal states of atoms arranged in a 3D optical lattice. From a\nsemi-classical analysis, we identify the linear and non-linear quantized\ncurrent responses of our 4D model, relating these to the topology of the Bloch\nbands. We then propose experimental protocols, based on current or\ncenter-of-mass-drift measurements, to extract the topological 2nd Chern number.\nOur proposal sets the stage for the exploration of novel topological phases in\nhigher dimensions.\n", "  IceCube has reported the detection of a diffuse TeV-PeV neutrino emission,\nfor which the flat spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) have been proposed to be the\ncandidate sources. Here we assume that the neutrino flux from FSRQs is\nproportional to their gamma-ray ones, and obtain the gamma-ray/neutrino flux\nratio by the diffuse gamma-ray flux from Fermi-LAT measurement of FSRQs and the\ndiffuse neutrino flux detected by IceCube. We apply this ratio to individual\nFSRQs and hence predict their neutrino flux. We find that a large fraction of\ncandidate FSRQs from the northern sky in the IceCube point source search has\npredicted neutrino flux above the IceCube upper limit; and for the sample of\nstacking search for neutrinos by IceCube, the predicted stacked flux is even\nlarger than the upper limit of stacked flux by orders of magnitude. Therefore\nthe IceCube limit from stacking searches, combined with the Fermi-LAT\nobservations, already rejects FSRQs as the main sources of IceCube-detected\ndiffuse neutrinos: FSRQs can only account for <10% (4%) of the IceCube-detected\ndiffuse neutrino flux, according to the stacking searches from the whole\n(northern) sky. The derived neutrino/gamma-ray flux ratio is <<1, also implying\nthat the gamma-ray emission from FSRQs cannot be produced by the secondary\nleptons and photons from the pion production processes. The caveat in the\nassumptions is discussed.\n", "  We identify and analyze thermal dark matter candidates in the fraternal twin\nHiggs model and its generalizations. The relic abundance of fraternal twin dark\nmatter is set by twin weak interactions, with a scale tightly tied to the weak\nscale of the Standard Model by naturalness considerations. As such, the dark\nmatter candidates benefit from a \"fraternal WIMP miracle,\" reproducing the\nobserved dark matter abundance for dark matter masses between 50 and 150 GeV.\nHowever, the couplings dominantly responsible for dark matter annihilation do\nnot lead to interactions with the visible sector. The direct detection rate is\ninstead set via fermionic Higgs portal interactions, which are likewise\nconstrained by naturalness considerations but parametrically weaker than those\nleading to dark matter annihilation. The predicted direct detection cross\nsection is close to current LUX bounds and presents an opportunity for the next\ngeneration of direct detection experiments.\n", "  Progress in the understanding of quantum critical properties of itinerant\nelectrons has been hindered by the lack of effective models which are amenable\nto controlled analytical and numerically exact calculations. Here we establish\nthat the disorder driven semimetal to metal quantum phase transition of three\ndimensional massless Dirac fermions could serve as a paradigmatic toy model for\nstudying itinerant quantum criticality, which is solved in this work by exact\nnumerical and approximate field theoretic calculations. As a result, we\nestablish the robust existence of a non-Gaussian universality class, and also\nconstruct the relevant low energy effective field theory that could guide the\nunderstanding of quantum critical scaling for many strange metals. Using the\nkernel polynomial method (KPM), we provide numerical results for the calculated\ndynamical exponent ($z$) and correlation length exponent ($\\nu$) for the\ndisorder-driven semimetal (SM) to diffusive metal (DM) quantum phase transition\nat the Dirac point for several types of disorder, establishing its universal\nnature and obtaining the numerical scaling functions in agreement with our\nfield theoretical analysis.\n", "  We derive the second-order hydrodynamic equation and the microscopic formulae\nof the relaxation times as well as the transport coefficients systematically\nfrom the relativistic Boltzmann equation. Our derivation is based on a novel\ndevelopment of the renormalization-group method, a powerful reduction theory of\ndynamical systems, which has been applied successfully to derive the\nnon-relativistic second-order hydrodynamic equation Our theory nicely gives a\ncompact expression of the deviation of the distribution function in terms of\nthe linearized collision operator, which is different from those used as an\nansatz in the conventional fourteen-moment method. It is confirmed that the\nresultant microscopic expressions of the transport coefficients coincide with\nthose derived in the Chapman-Enskog expansion method. Furthermore, we show that\nthe microscopic expressions of the relaxation times have natural and physically\nplausible forms. We prove that the propagating velocities of the fluctuations\nof the hydrodynamical variables do not exceed the light velocity, and hence our\nseconder-order equation ensures the desired causality. It is also confirmed\nthat the equilibrium state is stable for any perturbation described by our\nequation.\n", "  A complete model of the dynamics of scrape-off layer filaments will be rather\ncomplex, including temperature evolution, three dimensional geometry and finite\nLarmor radius effects. However, the basic mechanism of\n$\\boldsymbol{E}\\times\\boldsymbol{B}$ advection due to electrostatic potential\ndriven by the diamagnetic current can be captured in a much simpler model; a\ncomplete understanding of the physics in the simpler model will then aid\ninterpretation of more complex simulations, by allowing the new effects to be\ndisentangled. Here we consider such a simple model, which assumes cold ions and\nisothermal electrons and is reduced to two dimensions. We derive the scaling\nwith width and amplitude of the velocity of isolated scrape-off layer\nfilaments, allowing for arbitrary elliptical cross-sections, where previously\nonly circular cross-sections have been considered analytically. We also put the\nscaling with amplitude in a new and more satisfactory form. The analytical\nresults are extensively validated with two dimensional simulations and also\ncompared, with reasonable agreement, to three dimensional simulations having\nminimal variation parallel to the magnetic field.\n", "  We propose an experimental setup to measure the work performed in a\nnormal-metal/insulator/superconducting (NIS) junction, subjected to a voltage\nchange and in contact with a thermal bath. We compute the performed work and\nargue that the associated heat release can be measured experimentally. Our\nresults are based on an equivalence between the dynamics of the NIS junction\nand that of an assembly of two-level systems subjected to a circularly\npolarised field, for which we can determine the work-characteristic function\nexactly. The average work dissipated by the NIS junction, as well as its\nfluctuations, are determined. From the work characteristic function, we also\ncompute the work probability-distribution and show that it does not have a\nGaussian character. Our results allow for a direct experimental test of the\nCrooks-Tasaki fluctuation relation.\n", "  We analyze the controllability of a two-layer network, where driver nodes can\nbe chosen randomly only from one layer. Each layer contains a scale-free\nnetwork with directed links and the node dynamics depends on the incoming links\nfrom other nodes. We combine the in-degree and out-degree values to assign an\nimportance value $w$ to each node, and distinguish between peripheral nodes\nwith low $w$ and central nodes with high $w$. Based on numerical simulations,\nwe find that the controllable part of the network is larger when choosing low\n$w$ nodes to connect the two layers. The control is as efficient when\nperipheral nodes are driver nodes as it is for the case of more central nodes.\nHowever, if we assume a cost to utilize nodes that is proportional to their\noverall degree, utilizing peripheral nodes to connect the two layers or to act\nas driver nodes is not only the most cost-efficient solution, it is also the\none that performs best in controlling the two-layer network among the different\ninterconnecting strategies we have tested.\n", "  We present the results of T-even TMDs in a light front quark-diquark model of\nnucleons with the wave functions constructed from the soft-wall AdS/QCD\nprediction. The relations amongst TMDs are discussed. The $p_\\perp$ dependence\nof the TMDs are compared with the $t$-dependence of the GPDs. AdS/QCD wave\nfunction provides an explanation behind the approximate $x$ and $p_\\perp$\nfactorization observed in lattice TMD calculations.\n", "  In the iron based superconductors, one of the on-going frontier studies is\nabout the pairing mechanism. The recent interest concerns the high temperature\nsuperconductivity and its intimate reason in the monolayer FeSe thin films. The\nchallenge here is how the double superconducting gaps seen by the scanning\ntunnelling spectroscopy (STS) associate however to only one set of Fermi\npockets seen by the angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). The\nrecently discovered (Li1-xFexOH)FeSe phase with Tc=40 K provides a good\nplatform to check the fundamental problems. Here we report the STS study on the\n(Li1-xFexOH)FeSe single crystals. The STS spectrum clearly indicates the\npresence of double anisotropic gaps with maximum magnitudes of Delta_1=14.3 meV\nand Delta_2=8.6 meV, and mimics that of the monolayer FeSe thin film. Further\nanalysis based on the quasiparticle interference (QPI) allows us to rule out\nthe d-wave gap, and for the first time assign the larger (smaller) gap to the\nouter (inner) hybridized Fermi pockets associating with the dxy (dxz/dyz)\norbitals, respectively. The huge value Delta_1/k_BT_c = 8.7 discovered here\nundoubtedly proves the strong coupling mechanism in the present superconducting\nsystem.\n", "  We derive an effective spin Hamiltonian for the one-dimensional half-filled\nasymmetric ionic Hubbard model with alternating on-site interaction in the\nlimit of strong repulsion. It is shown that the effective Hamiltonian is that\nof a spin $S=1/2$ anisotropic $XXZ$ Heisenberg chain with alternating\nnext-nearest-neighbor and three-spin couplings in the presence of a uniform and\na staggered magnetic field.\n", "  We apply on-shell and integrability methods that have been developed in the\ncontext of scattering amplitudes in N=4 SYM theory to tree-level form factors\nof this theory. Focussing on the colour-ordered super form factors of the\nchiral part of the stress-tensor multiplet as an example, we show how to\nsystematically construct on-shell diagrams for these form factors with the\nminimal form factor as further building block in addition to the three-point\namplitudes. Moreover, we obtain analytic representations in terms of\nGra{\\ss}mannian integrals in spinor helicity, twistor and momentum twistor\nvariables. While Yangian invariance is broken by the operator insertion, we\nfind that the form factors are eigenstates of the integrable spin-chain\ntransfer matrix built from the monodromy matrix that yields the Yangian\ngenerators. Constructing them via the method of R operators allows to introduce\ndeformations that preserve the integrable structure. We finally show that the\nintegrable properties extend to minimal tree-level form factors of generic\ncomposite operators as well as certain leading singularities of their n-point\nloop-level form factors.\n", "  In this introductory review, we give an overview of the computational\nchemistry methods commonly used in the field of metal-organic frameworks\n(MOFs), to describe or predict the structures themselves and characterize their\nvarious properties, either at the quantum chemical level or through classical\nmolecular simulation. We discuss the methods for the prediction of crystal\nstructures, geometrical properties and large-scale screening of hypothetical\nMOFs, as well as their thermal and mechanical properties. A separate section\ndeals with the simulation of adsorption of fluids and fluid mixtures in MOFs.\n", "  In this work, the effects of non-commutative and commutative vacua on the\nphase space generated by a scalar field in a scalar torsion scenario are\ninvestigated. For both classical and quantum regimes, the commutative and\nnon-commutative cases are compared. To take account the effects of\nnon-commutativity, two well known non-commutative parameters, $\\theta$ and\n$\\beta,$ are introduced. It should be emphasized, the effects of $\\beta$ which\nis related to momentum sector has more key role in comparison to $\\theta$ which\nis related to space sector. Also the different boundary conditions and\nmathematical interpretations of non-commutativity are explored.\n", "  We compare DNS calculations of homogeneous isotropic turbulence with the\nstatistical properties of intra-cluster turbulence from the Matryoshka Run\n(Miniati 2014) and find remarkable similarities between their inertial ranges.\nThis allowed us to use the time dependent statistical properties of\nintra-cluster turbulence to evaluate dynamo action in the intra-cluster medium,\nbased on earlier results from numerically resolved nonlinear\nmagneto-hydrodynamic turbulent dynamo (Beresnyak 2012). We argue that this\napproach is necessary (a) to properly normalize dynamo action to the available\nintra-cluster turbulent energy and (b) to overcome the limitations of low Re\naffecting current numerical models of the intra-cluster medium. We find that\nwhile the properties of intra-cluster magnetic field are largely insensitive to\nthe value and origin of the seed field, the resulting values for the Alfven\nspeed and the outer scale of the magnetic field are consistent with current\nobservational estimates, basically confirming the idea that magnetic field in\ntoday's galaxy clusters is a record of its past turbulent activity.\n", "  We present a theoretical analysis of the acoustic radiation force on a single\nsmall particle, either a thermoviscous fluid droplet or a thermoelastic solid\nparticle, suspended in a viscous and heat-conducting fluid medium. Our analysis\nplaces no restrictions on the length scales of the viscous and thermal boundary\nlayer thicknesses $\\delta_\\mathrm{s}$ and $\\delta_\\mathrm{t}$ relative to the\nparticle radius $a$, but it assumes the particle to be small in comparison to\nthe acoustic wavelength $\\lambda$. This is the limit relevant to scattering of\nsound and ultrasound waves from micrometer-sized particles. For particles of\nsize comparable to or smaller than the boundary layers, the thermoviscous\ntheory leads to profound consequences for the acoustic radiation force. Not\nonly do we predict forces orders of magnitude larger than expected from\nideal-fluid theory, but for certain relevant choices of materials, we also find\na sign change in the acoustic radiation force on different-sized but otherwise\nidentical particles. This phenomenon may possibly be exploited in handling of\nsubmicrometer-sized particles such as bacteria and vira in lab-on-a-chip\nsystems.\n", "  Fractional quantum Hall quasiparticles are famous for having fractional\nelectric charge. Recent experiments report that the quasiparticles' effective\nelectric charge determined through tunneling current noise measurements can\ndepend on the system parameters such as temperature or bias voltage. Several\nworks proposed to understand this as a signature for edge theory properties\nchanging with energy scale. I consider two of such experiments and show that in\none of them the apparent dependence of the electric charge on a system\nparameter is likely to be an artefact of experimental data analysis.\nConversely, in the second experiment the dependence cannot be explained in such\na way.\n", "  Using random matrices, we study the reduced dynamics of a two level system\ninteracting with a generic environment. In the weak coupling limit, the result\ncan be obtained directly from known results for purity decay, and result in\nMarkovian dynamics. We then focus on the case of strong coupling, when the\ndynamics is known to be non-Markovian. In this regime, the coupling dominates\nover the local parts of the Hamiltonian, and thus we treat the latter as a\nperturbation of the former. With the help of the linear response approximation,\nthis allows us to obtain an analytical description of the reduced dynamics.\nFinally, we find a transition from non-Markovian to Markovian dynamics at a\npoint where the coupling and the local Hamiltonian are comparable in size.\n", "  We develop a time-dependent theory to investigate electron dynamics and\nphotoionization processes of diatomic molecules interacting with strong laser\nfields including electron-electron correlation effects. We combine the recently\nformulated time-dependent generalized-active-space configuration interaction\ntheory [D. Hochstuhl and M. Bonitz, Phys. Rev. A 86, 053424 (2012); S. Bauch,\net al., Phys. Rev. A 90, 062508 (2014)] with a prolate spheroidal basis set\nincluding localized orbitals and continuum states to describe the bound\nelectrons and the outgoing photoelectron. As an example, we study the\nstrong-field ionization of the two-center four-electron lithium hydride\nmolecule in different intensity regimes. By using single-cycle pulses, two\norientations of the asymmetric heteronuclear molecule are investigated: Li-H,\nwith the electrical field pointing from H to Li, and the opposite case of H-Li.\nThe preferred orientation for ionization is determined and we find a transition\nfrom H-Li, for low intensity, to Li-H, for high intensity. The influence of\nelectron correlations is studied at different levels of approximation, and we\nfind a significant change in the preferred orientation. For certain intensity\nregimes, even an interchange of the preferred configuration is observed,\nrelative to the uncorrelated simulations. Further insight is provided by\ndetailed comparisons of photoelectron angular distributions with and without\ncorrelation effects taken into account.\n", "  Analytically tractable dynamical systems exhibiting a whole range of normal\nand anomalous deterministic diffusion are rare. Here we introduce a simple\nnon-chaotic model in terms of an interval exchange transformation suitably\nlifted onto the whole real line which preserves distances except at a countable\nset of points. This property, which leads to vanishing Lyapunov exponents, is\ndesigned to mimic diffusion in non-chaotic polygonal billiards that give rise\nto normal and anomalous diffusion in a fully deterministic setting. As these\nbilliards are typically too complicated to be analyzed from first principles,\nsimplified models are needed to identify the minimal ingredients generating the\ndifferent transport regimes. For our model, which we call the slicer map, we\ncalculate all its moments in position analytically under variation of a single\ncontrol parameter. We show that the slicer map exhibits a transition from\nsubdiffusion over normal diffusion to superdiffusion under parameter variation.\nOur results may help to understand the delicate parameter dependence of the\ntype of diffusion generated by polygonal billiards. We argue that in different\nparameter regions the transport properties of our simple model match to\ndifferent classes of known stochastic processes. This may shed light on\ndifficulties to match diffusion in polygonal billiards to a single anomalous\nstochastic process.\n", "  A double well loaded with bosonic atoms represents an ideal candidate to\nsimulate some of the most interesting aspects in the phenomenology of\nthermalisation and equilibration. Here we report an exhaustive analysis of the\ndynamics and steady state properties of such a system locally in contact with\ndifferent temperature reservoirs. We show that thermalisation only occurs\n'accidentally'. We further examine the nonclassical features and energy fluxes\nimplied by the dynamics of the double-well system, thus exploring its\nfinite-time thermodynamics in relation to the settlement of nonclassical\ncorrelations between the wells.\n", "  In this article we study self-gravitating static solutions of the\nEinstein-ScalarField system in arbitrary dimensions. We discuss the existence\nand the non-existence of geodesically complete solutions depending on the form\nof the scalar field potential $V(\\phi)$, and provide full global geometric\nestimates when the solutions exist. Our main results are summarised as follows.\nFor the Klein-Gordon field, namely when $V(\\phi)=m^{2}|\\phi|^{2}$, it is proved\nthat geodesically complete solutions have Ricci-flat spatial metric, have\nconstant lapse and are vacuum, (that is $\\phi$ is constant and equal to zero if\n$m\\neq 0$). In particular, when the spatial dimension is three, the only such\nsolutions are either Minkowski or a quotient thereof (no nontrivial solutions\nexist). When $V(\\phi)=m^{2}|\\phi|^{2}+2\\Lambda$, that is, when a vacuum energy\nor a cosmological constant is included, it is proved that no geodesically\ncomplete solution exists when $\\Lambda>0$, whereas when $\\Lambda<0$ it is\nproved that no non-vacuum geodesically complete solution exists unless\n$m^{2}<-2\\Lambda/(n-1)$, ($n$ is the spatial dimension) and the spatial\nmanifold is non-compact. The proofs are based on techniques in comparison\ngeometry \\'a la Backry-Emery.\n", "  The NEMO Phase-2 tower is the first detector which was operated underwater\nfor more than one year at the \"record\" depth of 3500 m. It was designed and\nbuilt within the framework of the NEMO (NEutrino Mediterranean Observatory)\nproject. The 380 m high tower was successfully installed in March 2013 80 km\noffshore Capo Passero (Italy). This is the first prototype operated on the site\nwhere the italian node of the KM3NeT neutrino telescope will be built. The\ninstallation and operation of the NEMO Phase-2 tower has proven the\nfunctionality of the infrastructure and the operability at 3500 m depth. A more\nthan one year long monitoring of the deep water characteristics of the site has\nbeen also provided. In this paper the infrastructure and the tower structure\nand instrumentation are described. The results of long term optical background\nmeasurements are presented. The rates show stable and low baseline values,\ncompatible with the contribution of 40K light emission, with a small percentage\nof light bursts due to bioluminescence. All these features confirm the\nstability and good optical properties of the site.\n", "  The Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO), a 20 kton multi-purpose\nunderground liquid scintillator detector, was proposed with the determination\nof the neutrino mass hierarchy as a primary physics goal. It is also capable of\nobserving neutrinos from terrestrial and extra-terrestrial sources, including\nsupernova burst neutrinos, diffuse supernova neutrino background, geoneutrinos,\natmospheric neutrinos, solar neutrinos, as well as exotic searches such as\nnucleon decays, dark matter, sterile neutrinos, etc. We present the physics\nmotivations and the anticipated performance of the JUNO detector for various\nproposed measurements. By detecting reactor antineutrinos from two power plants\nat 53-km distance, JUNO will determine the neutrino mass hierarchy at a 3-4\nsigma significance with six years of running. The measurement of antineutrino\nspectrum will also lead to the precise determination of three out of the six\noscillation parameters to an accuracy of better than 1\\%. Neutrino burst from a\ntypical core-collapse supernova at 10 kpc would lead to ~5000\ninverse-beta-decay events and ~2000 all-flavor neutrino-proton elastic\nscattering events in JUNO. Detection of DSNB would provide valuable information\non the cosmic star-formation rate and the average core-collapsed neutrino\nenergy spectrum. Geo-neutrinos can be detected in JUNO with a rate of ~400\nevents per year, significantly improving the statistics of existing geoneutrino\nsamples. The JUNO detector is sensitive to several exotic searches, e.g. proton\ndecay via the $p\\to K^++\\bar\\nu$ decay channel. The JUNO detector will provide\na unique facility to address many outstanding crucial questions in particle and\nastrophysics. It holds the great potential for further advancing our quest to\nunderstanding the fundamental properties of neutrinos, one of the building\nblocks of our Universe.\n", "  We demonstrate the multiplexing of a classical coherent and a quantum state\nof light in a single telecommunciation fiber. For this purpose we make use of\nspontaneous parametric down conversion and quantum frequency conversion to\ngenerate photon pairs at 854 nm and the telecom O-band. The herald photon\ntriggers a telecom C-band laser pulse. The telecom single photon and the laser\npulse are combined and coupled to a standard telecom fiber. Low background time\ncorrelation of the classical and quantum signal behind the fiber shows\nsuccessful telecommunication channel multiplexing.\n", "  Let $\\mathfrak{g}$ be a symmetrizable Kac-Moody algebra and let\n$U_q(\\mathfrak{g})$ denote the corresponding quantized enveloping algebra. In\nthe present paper we show that quantum symmetric pair coideal subalgebras\n$B_{c,s}$ of $U_q(\\mathfrak{g})$ have a universal K-matrix if $\\mathfrak{g}$ is\nof finite type. By a universal K-matrix for $B_{c,s}$ we mean an element in a\ncompletion of $U_q(\\mathfrak{g})$ which commutes with $B_{c,s}$ and provides\nsolutions of the reflection equation in all integrable\n$U_q(\\mathfrak{g})$-modules in category $\\mathcal{O}$. The construction of the\nuniversal K-matrix for $B_{c,s}$ bears significant resemblance to the\nconstruction of the universal R-matrix for $U_q(\\mathfrak{g})$. Most steps in\nthe construction of the universal K-matrix are performed in the general\nKac-Moody setting.\n  In the late nineties T. tom Dieck and R. H\\\"aring-Oldenburg developed a\nprogram of representations of categories of ribbons in a cylinder. Our results\nshow that quantum symmetric pairs provide a large class of examples for this\nprogram.\n", "  We show that the topological recursion for the (semi-classical) spectral\ncurve of the first Painlev\\'e equation $P_{\\rm I}$ gives a WKB solution for the\nisomonodromy problem for $P_{\\rm I}$. In other words, the isomonodromy system\nis a quantum curve in the sense of [Dumitrescu O., Mulase M., Lett. Math. Phys.\n104 (2014), 635-671, arXiv:1310.6022] and [Dumitrescu O., Mulase M.,\narXiv:1411.1023].\n", "  The surface spin states for bismuth thin films were investigated using an\n$sp^3$ tight-binding model. The model explains the experimental observations\nusing angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, including the Fermi surface,\nthe band structure with Rashba spin splitting, and the quantum confinement in\nthe energy band gap of the surface states. A large out-of-plane spin component\nalso appears. The surface states penetrate inside the film to within\napproximately a few bilayers near the Brillouin-zone center, whereas they reach\nthe center of the film near the Brillouin-zone boundary.\n", "  Comparative analysis of second harmonic generation in ordinary and\nbackward-wave settings is presented. Extraordinary properties of frequency\ndoubling nonlinear optical reflectivity and pulse shaping through phase\nmatching of ordinary and backward electromagnetic waves in the nanowaveguides\nwith mixed negative/positive spatial dispersion is demonstrated with numerical\nsimulations.\n", "  In the real world, many complex systems are represented not by single\nnetworks but rather by sets of interdependent ones. In these specific networks,\nnodes in one network mutually interact with nodes in other networks. This paper\nfocuses on a simple representative case of two-layer networks (the so-called\nduplex networks) with unidirectional inter-layer couplings. That is, each node\nin one network depends on a counterpart in the other network. Accordingly, the\nformer network is called the response layer and the latter network is the drive\nlayer. Specifically, synchronization between each node in the drive layer and\nits counterpart in the response layer (counterpart synchronization, or CS) of\nthis sort of duplex networks with delayed nodes and noise perturbation is\ninvestigated. Based on the LaSalle-type invariance principle, a control\ntechnique is proposed and a sufficient condition is developed for realizing\ncounterpart synchronization of duplex networks. Furthermore, two corollaries\nare derived as special cases. In addition, node dynamics within each layer can\nbe various and topologies of the two layers are not necessarily identical.\nTherefore, the proposed synchronization method can be applied to a wide range\nof multiplex networks. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the\nfeasibility and effectiveness of the results.\n", "  Using a void catalog from the SDSS survey, we present the first measurements\nof void clustering and the corresponding void bias. Over the range 30-200 Mpc/h\nthe void auto-correlation is detected at 5-sigma significance for voids of\nradius 15-20 Mpc/h. We also measure the void-galaxy cross-correlation at higher\nsignal-to-noise and compare the inferred void bias with the autocorrelation\nresults. Void bias is constant with scale for voids of a given size, but its\nvalue falls from 5.6 +/- 1.0 to below zero as the void radius increases from 15\nto 30 Mpc/h. The comparison of our measurements with carefully matched galaxy\nmock catalogs, with no free parameters related to the voids, shows that model\npredictions can be reliably made for void correlations. We study the dependence\nof void bias on tracer density and void size with a view to future\napplications. In combination with our previous lensing measurements of void\nmass profiles, these clustering measurements provide another step towards using\nvoids as cosmological tracers.\n", "  We investigate the formation of discrete breathers (DBs) and the dynamics of\nthe mixture of two-species Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) in open boundary\noptical lattices using the discrete nonlinear Schr\\\"{o}dinger equations. The\nresults show that the coupling of intra- and interspecies interaction can lead\nto the existence of pure single-species DBs and symbiotic DBs (i.e.,\ntwo-species DBs). Furthermore, we find that there is a selective distillation\nphenomenon in the dynamics of the mixture of two-species BECs. One can\nselectively distil one species from the mixture of two-species BECs and can\neven control dominant species fraction by adjusting the intra- and interspecies\ninteraction in optical lattices. Our selective distillation mechanism may find\npotential application in quantum information storage and quantum information\nprocessing based on multi-species atoms.\n", "  In deep tissue photoacoustic imaging, the spatial resolution is inherently\nlimited by acoustic diffraction. Moreover, as the ultrasound attenuation\nincreases with frequency, resolution is often traded-off for penetration depth.\nHere we report on super-resolution photoacoustic imaging by use of multiple\nspeckle illumination. Specifically, we show that the analysis of second-order\nfluctuations of the photoacoustic images combined with image deconvolution\nenables resolving optically absorbing structures beyond the acoustic\ndiffraction limit. A resolution increase of almost a factor 2 is demonstrated\nexperimentally. Our method introduces a new framework that could potentially\nlead to deep tissue photoacoustic imaging with sub-acoustic resolution.\n", "  We derive some exact results concerning the anomalous U(1)$_A$ symmetry in\nthe chirally symmetric phase of QCD at high temperature. We discuss the\nimportance of topology and finite-volume effects on the U(1)$_A$ symmetry\nviolation characterized by the difference of chiral susceptibilities. In\nparticular, we present a reliable method to measure the anomaly strength in\nlattice simulations with fixed topology. We also derive new spectral sum rules\nand a novel Banks-Casher-type relation. Through our spectral analysis we arrive\nat a simple alternative proof of the Aoki-Fukaya-Taniguchi \"theorem\" on the\neffective restoration of the U(1)$_A$ symmetry at high temperature.\n", "  The strength and tensor structure of the Higgs boson's interactions are\ninvestigated within an effective field theory framework, which allows new\nCP-even and CP-odd interactions that can lead to changes in the kinematic\nproperties of the Higgs boson and associated jet spectra. The parameters of the\neffective field theory are probed using a fit to five differential cross\nsections previously measured by the ATLAS experiment in the $H \\rightarrow\n\\gamma\\gamma$ decay channel with an integrated luminosity of 20.3 fb$^{-1}$ at\n$\\sqrt{s}=8$ TeV. In order to perform a simultaneous fit to the five\ndistributions, the statistical correlations between them are determined by\nre-analysing the $H \\rightarrow \\gamma\\gamma$ candidate events in the\nproton-proton collision data. No significant deviations from the Standard Model\nare observed and limits on the effective field theory parameters are derived.\nThe statistical correlations are made publicly available to allow for future\nanalysis of theories with non-Standard Model interactions.\n", "  Relativistic Weyl fermion (WF) often appears in the band structure of three\ndimensional magnetic materials and acts as a source or sink of the Berry\ncurvature, i.e., the (anti-)monopole. It has been believed that the WFs are\nstable due to their topological indices except when two Weyl fermions of\nopposite chiralities annihilate pairwise. Here, we theoretically show for a\nmodel including the electron-electron interaction that the Mott gap opens for\neach WF without violating the topological stability, leading to a topological\nMott insulator dubbed {\\it Weyl Mott insulator } (WMI). This WMI is\ncharacterized by several novel features such as (i) energy gaps in the\nangle-resolved photo-emission spectroscopy (ARPES) and the optical\nconductivity, (ii) the nonvanishing Hall conductance, and (iii) the Fermi arc\non the surface with the penetration depth diverging as approaching to the\nmomentum at which the Weyl point is projected. Experimental detection of the\nWMI by distinguishing from conventional Mott insulators is discussed with\npossible relevance to pyrochlore iridates.\n", "  The question of how a metal becoming superconducting expels a magnetic field\nis addressed. It is argued that the conventional theory of superconductivity\nhas not answered this question despite its obvious importance. We argue that\nthe growth of the superconducting into the normal region and associated\nexpulsion of magnetic field from the superconducting region can only be\nunderstood if it is accompanied by motion of charge from the superconducting\ninto the normal region. From a microscopic point of view it is shown that the\nperfect diamagnetism of superconductors requires that superconducting electrons\nreside in orbits of spatial extent $2\\lambda_L$, with $\\lambda_L$ the London\npenetration depth. Associated with this physics, the spin-orbit interaction of\nthe electron magnetic moment and the positively charged ionic background gives\nrise to a \"Spin Meissner\" effect, the generation of a macroscopic spin current\nnear the surface of superconductors. We point out that both the Meissner and\nthe Spin Meissner effect can be understood dynamically under the assumption\nthat the superfluid condensate wavefunction $\\Psi(\\vec{r})$ does not screen\nitself, just like the $\\Psi(\\vec{r})$ for an electron in a hydrogen atom. We\nargue that the conventional theory of superconductivity cannot explain the\nMeissner effect because it does not contain the physical elements discussed\nhere.\n", "  The Daya Bay experiment was the first to report simultaneous measurements of\nreactor antineutrinos at multiple baselines leading to the discovery of\n$\\bar{\\nu}_e$ oscillations over km-baselines. Subsequent data has provided the\nworld's most precise measurement of $\\rm{sin}^22\\theta_{13}$ and the effective\nmass splitting $\\Delta m_{ee}^2$. The experiment is located in Daya Bay, China\nwhere the cluster of six nuclear reactors is among the world's most prolific\nsources of electron antineutrinos. Multiple antineutrino detectors are deployed\nin three underground water pools at different distances from the reactor cores\nto search for deviations in the antineutrino rate and energy spectrum due to\nneutrino mixing. Instrumented with photomultiplier tubes (PMTs), the water\npools serve as shielding against natural radioactivity from the surrounding\nrock and provide efficient muon tagging. Arrays of resistive plate chambers\nover the top of each pool provide additional muon detection. The antineutrino\ndetectors were specifically designed for measurements of the antineutrino flux\nwith minimal systematic uncertainty. Relative detector efficiencies between the\nnear and far detectors are known to better than 0.2%. With the unblinding of\nthe final two detectors' baselines and target masses, a complete description\nand comparison of the eight antineutrino detectors can now be presented. This\npaper describes the Daya Bay detector systems, consisting of eight antineutrino\ndetectors in three instrumented water pools in three underground halls, and\ntheir operation through the first year of eight detector data-taking.\n", "  This paper designs an efficient two-class pattern classifier utilizing\nasynchronous cellular automata (ACAs). The two-state three-neighborhood\none-dimensional ACAs that converge to fixed points from arbitrary seeds are\nused here for pattern classification. To design the classifier, we first\nidentify a set of ACAs that always converge to fixed points from any seeds with\nfollowing properties - (1) each ACA should have at least two but not huge\nnumber of fixed point attractors, and (2) the convergence time of these ACAs\nare not to be exponential. In order to address the first issue, we propose a\ngraph, coined as fixed point graph of an ACA that facilitates in counting the\nfixed points. We further perform an experimental study to estimate the\nconvergence time of ACAs, and find that there are some convergent ACAs which\ndemand exponential convergence time. Finally, we find that there are 71 (out of\n256) ACAs which can be effective candidates as pattern classifier. We use each\nof the candidate ACAs on some standard data sets, and observe the effectiveness\nof each ACAs as pattern classifier. It is observed that the proposed classifier\nis very competitive and performs reliably better than many standard existing\nalgorithms.\n", "  Previous studies have shown that supersymmetric partition function on $T^2\n\\times S^2$ is related to elliptic genus of two dimensional supersymmetric\ntheory. In this short note we find a four dimensional supersymmetric theory,\nwhose partition function on $T^2 \\times S^2$ is the same as elliptic genera of\n$\\mathcal{N}=2$ minimal models in two dimensions.\n", "  The rise of social media platforms has fundamentally altered the public\ndiscourse by providing easy to use and ubiquitous forums for the exchange of\nideas and opinions. Elected officials often use such platforms for\ncommunication with the broader public to disseminate information and engage\nwith their constituencies and other public officials. In this work, we\ninvestigate whether Twitter conversations between legislators reveal their\nreal-world position and influence by analyzing multiple Twitter networks that\nfeature different types of link relations between the Members of Parliament\n(MPs) in the United Kingdom and an identical data set for politicians within\nIreland. We develop and apply a matrix factorization technique that allows the\nanalyst to emphasize nodes with contextual local network structures by\nspecifying network statistics that guide the factorization solution. Leveraging\nonly link relation data, we find that important politicians in Twitter networks\nare associated with real-world leadership positions, and that rankings from the\nproposed method are correlated with the number of future media headlines.\n", "  We report the superconductivity in Ca-intercalated bilayer graphene\nC$_6$CaC$_6$, the thinnest limit of Ca graphite intercalation compound. We\nperformed \\textit{in situ} electrical transport measurements on pristine\nbilayer graphene, C$_6$LiC$_6$ and C$_6$CaC$_6$ fabricated on SiC substrate\nunder zero and non-zero magnetic field. While both bilayer graphene and\nC$_6$LiC$_6$ show non-superconducting behavior, C$_6$CaC$_6$ exhibits the\nsuperconductivity with transition temperature ($T_{{\\rm c}}$) of 4.0 K. The\nobserved $T_{{\\rm c}}$ in C$_6$CaC$_6$ and the absence of superconductivity in\nC$_6$LiC$_6$ show a good agreement with the theoretical prediction, suggesting\nthe importance of a free-electron-like metallic band at the Fermi level to\ndrive the superconductivity.\n", "  The mass-constraining variable $M_2$, a $(1+3)$-dimensional natural successor\nof extremely popular $M_{T2}$, possesses an array of rich features having the\nability to use on-shell mass constraints in semi-invisible production at a\nhadron collider. In this work, we investigate the consequence of applying a\nheavy resonance mass-shell constraint in the context of a semi-invisible antler\ndecay topology produced at the LHC. Our proposed variable, under additional\nconstraint, develops a new kink solution at the true masses. This enables one\nto determine the invisible particle mass simultaneously with the parent\nparticle mass from these events. We analyze in a way to measure this kink\noptimally, exploring the origin and the properties of such interesting\ncharacteristics. We also study the event reconstruction capability inferred\nfrom this new variable and find that the resulting momenta are unique and well\ncorrelated with true invisible particle momenta.\n", "  Freely decaying relativistic force-free turbulence is studied for the first\ntime. We initiate the magnetic field at a short wavelength and simulate its\nrelaxation toward equilibrium on two and three dimensional periodic domains, in\nboth helical and non-helical settings. Force-free turbulent relaxation is found\nto exhibit an inverse cascade in all settings, and in 3D to have a magnetic\nenergy spectrum consistent with the Kolmogorov $5/3$ power law. 3D relaxations\nalso obey the Taylor hypothesis; they settle promptly into the lowest energy\nconfiguration allowed by conservation of the total magnetic helicity. But in\n2D, the relaxed state is a force-free equilibrium whose energy greatly exceeds\nthe Taylor minimum, and which contains persistent force-free current layers and\nisolated flux tubes. We explain this behavior in terms of additional\ntopological invariants that exist only in two dimensions, namely the helicity\nenclosed within each level surface of the magnetic potential function. The\nspeed and completeness of turbulent magnetic free energy discharge could help\naccount for rapidly variable gamma-ray emission from the Crab Nebula, gamma-ray\nbursts, blazars, and radio galaxies.\n", "  Cellular processes do not follow deterministic rules; even in identical\nenvironments genetically identical cells can make random choices leading to\ndifferent phenotypes. This randomness originates from fluctuations present in\nthe biomolecular interaction networks. Most previous work has been focused on\nthe intrinsic noise (IN) of these networks. Yet, especially for\nhigh-copy-number biomolecules, extrinsic or environmental noise (EN) has been\nexperimentally shown to dominate the variation. Here, we develop an analytical\nformalism that allows for calculation of the effect of EN on gene-expression\nmotifs. We introduce a method for modeling bounded EN as an auxiliary species\nin the master equation. The method is fully generic and is not limited to\nsystems with small EN magnitudes. We focus our study on motifs that can be\nviewed as the building blocks of genetic switches: a nonregulated gene, a\nself-inhibiting gene, and a self-promoting gene. The role of the EN properties\n(magnitude, correlation time, and distribution) on the statistics of interest\nare systematically investigated, and the effect of fluctuations in different\nreaction rates is compared. Due to its analytical nature, our formalism can be\nused to quantify the effect of EN on the dynamics of biochemical networks and\ncan also be used to improve the interpretation of data from single-cell\ngene-expression experiments.\n", "  We reveal the existence of high-density Feshbach resonances in the collision\nbetween the ground and metastable states of $^{171}$Yb and coherently produce\nthe associated Feshbach molecules by photoassociation. The extremely small\ntransition rate is overcome by the enhanced Franck-Condon factor of the weakly\nbound Feshbach molecule, allowing us to observe Rabi oscillations with long\ndecay time between an atom pair and a molecule in an optical lattice. We also\nperform the precision measurement of the binding energies, which characterizes\nthe observed resonances. The ultra-narrow photoassociation will be a basis for\npractical implementation of optical Feshbach resonances.\n", "  We study $5d$ gauge theories that go in the UV to $6d$ $\\mathcal{N}$$=(1,0)$\nSCFT. We focus on these theories that can be engineered in string theory by\nbrane webs. Given a theory in this class, we propose a method to determine the\n$6d$ SCFT it goes to. We also discuss the implication of this to the\ncompactification of the resulting $6d$ SCFT on a torus to $4d$. We test and\ndemonstrate this method with a variety of examples.\n", "  During the past 15 years a new field has emerged, which combines\nsuperconductivity and spintronics, with the goal to pave a way for new types of\ndevices for applications combining the virtues of both by offering the\npossibility of long-range spin-polarized supercurrents. Such supercurrents\nconstitute a fruitful basis for the study of fundamental physics as they\ncombine macroscopic quantum coherence with microscopic exchange interactions,\nspin selectivity, and spin transport. This report follows recent developments\nin the controlled creation of long-range equal-spin triplet supercurrents in\nferromagnets and its contribution to spintronics. The mutual proximity-induced\nmodification of order in superconductor-ferromagnet hybrid structures\nintroduces in a natural way such evasive phenomena as triplet\nsuperconductivity, odd-frequency pairing, Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov\npairing, long-range equal-spin supercurrents, $\\pi$-Josephson junctions, as\nwell as long-range magnetic proximity effects. All these effects were rather\nexotic before 2000, when improvements in nanofabrication and materials control\nallowed for a new quality of hybrid structures. Guided by pioneering\ntheoretical studies, experimental progress evolved rapidly, and since 2010\ntriplet supercurrents are routinely produced and observed. We have entered a\nnew stage of studying new phases of matter previously out of our reach, and of\nmerging the hitherto disparate fields of superconductivity and spintronics to a\nnew research direction: super-spintronics.\n", "  Based on first- and second-order perturbation theory, we present a numerical\nstudy of the temporal build-up and decay of unsteady acoustic fields and\nacoustic streaming flows actuated by vibrating walls in the transverse\ncross-sectional plane of a long straight microchannel under adiabatic\nconditions and assuming temperature-independent material parameters. The\nunsteady streaming flow is obtained by averaging the time-dependent velocity\nfield over one oscillation period, and as time increases, it is shown to\nconverge towards the well-known steady time-averaged solution calculated in the\nfrequency domain. Scaling analysis reveals that the acoustic resonance builds\nup much faster than the acoustic streaming, implying that the radiation force\nmay dominate over the drag force from streaming even for small particles.\nHowever, our numerical time-dependent analysis indicates that pulsed actuation\ndoes not reduce streaming significantly due to its slow decay. Our analysis\nalso shows that for an acoustic resonance with a quality factor Q, the\namplitude of the oscillating second-order velocity component is Q times larger\nthan the usual second-order steady time-averaged velocity component.\nConsequently, the well-known criterion v << c for the validity of the\nperturbation expansion is replaced by the more restrictive criterion v << c/Q.\nOur numerical model is available in the supplemental material in the form of\nComsol model files and Matlab scripts.\n", "  Using moderate-resolution optical spectra from 58 background Lyman-break\ngalaxies and quasars at $z\\sim 2.3-3$ within a $11.5'\\times13.5'$ area of the\nCOSMOS field ($\\sim 1200\\,\\mathrm{deg}^2$ projected area density or $\\sim\n2.4\\,h^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{Mpc}$ mean transverse separation), we reconstruct a 3D\ntomographic map of the foreground Ly$\\alpha$ forest absorption at $2.2<z<2.5$\nwith an effective smoothing scale of\n$\\sigma_{3d}\\approx3.5\\,h^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{Mpc}$ comoving. Comparing with 61\ncoeval galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts in the same volume, we find that\nthe galaxy positions are clearly biased towards regions with enhanced IGM\nabsorption in the tomographic map. We find an extended IGM overdensity with\ndeep absorption troughs at $z=2.45$ associated with a recently-discovered\ngalaxy protocluster at the same redshift. Based on simulations matched to our\ndata, we estimate the enclosed dark matter mass within this IGM overdensity to\nbe $M_{\\rm dm} (z=2.45) = (9\\pm4)\\times 10^{13}\\,h^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{M_\\odot}$, and\nargue based on this mass and absorption strength that it will form at least one\n$z\\sim0$ galaxy cluster with $M(z=0) = (3\\pm 2) \\times\n10^{14}\\,h^{-1}\\mathrm{M_\\odot}$, although its elongated nature suggests that\nit will likely collapse into two separate clusters. We also point out a compact\noverdensity of six MOSDEF galaxies at $z=2.30$ within a $r\\sim\n1\\,h^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{Mpc}$ radius and $\\Delta z\\sim 0.006$, which does not appear\nto have a large associated IGM overdensity. These results demonstrate the\npotential of Ly$\\alpha$ forest tomography on larger volumes to study galaxy\nproperties as a function of environment, as well as revealing the large-scale\nIGM overdensities associated with protoclusters and other features of\nlarge-scale structure.\n", "  Standard perturbative quantum gravity formalism is applied to compute the\nlowest order corrections to the spatially flat cosmological FLRW solution\ngoverned by ordinary matter. The presented approach is analogous to the one\nused to compute quantum corrections to the Coulomb potential in\nelectrodynamics, or to the approach applied in computation of quantum\ncorrections to the Schwarzschild solution in gravity. In this framework, it is\nshown that the corrections to the classical metric coming from the one-loop\ngraviton vacuum polarization (self-energy) have (UV cutoff dependent) repulsive\nproperties, which could be not negligible in the very early Universe.\n", "  We report the experimental measurement of the equation of state of a\ntwo-dimensional Fermi gas with attractive s-wave interactions throughout the\ncrossover from a weakly coupled Fermi gas to a Bose gas of tightly bound dimers\nas the interaction strength is varied. We demonstrate that interactions lead to\na renormalization of the density of the Fermi gas by several orders of\nmagnitude. We compare our data near the ground state and at finite temperature\nto predictions for both fermions and bosons from Quantum Monte Carlo\nsimulations and Luttinger-Ward theory. Our results serve as input for\ninvestigations of close-to-equilibrium dynamics and transport in the\ntwo-dimensional system.\n", "  We have developed and implemented a compact transparent nozzle for use in\nlaser vaporization sources. This nozzle eliminates the need for an ablation\naperture, allowing for a more intense molecular beam. We use this nozzle to\nprepare a molecular beam of aluminum monohydride (AlH) suitable for ion trap\nloading of AlH$^+$ via photoionization in ultra-high vacuum. We demonstrate\nstable AlH production over hour time scales using a liquid ablation target. The\nlong-term stability, low heat load and fast ion production rate of this source\nare well-suited to molecular ion experiments employing destructive state\nreadout schemes requiring frequent trap reloading.\n", "  We demonstrate that the recent measurement of azimuthally collimated, long\nrange rapidity (\"ridge\") correlations in $\\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV proton-proton (p+p)\ncollisions by the ATLAS collaboration at the LHC are in agreement with\nexpectations from the color glass condensate effective theory of high energy\nQCD. The observation that the integrated near side yield as a function of\nmultiplicity is independent of collision energy is a natural consequence of the\nfact that multiparticle production is driven by a single semi-hard saturation\nscale in the color glass condensate framework. We argue further that the\nazimuthal structure of these recent ATLAS ridge measurements strongly constrain\nhydrodynamic interpretations of such correlations in high multiplicity p+p\ncollisions.\n", "  Phase transition of the Ising model is investigated on a planar lattice that\nhas a fractal structure. On the lattice, the number of bonds that cross the\nborder of a finite area is doubled when the linear size of the area is extended\nby a factor of four. The free energy and the spontaneous magnetization of the\nsystem are obtained by means of the higher-order tensor renormalization group\nmethod. The system exhibits the order-disorder phase transition, where the\ncritical indices are different from that of the square-lattice Ising model. An\nexponential decay is observed in the density matrix spectrum even at the\ncritical point. It is possible to interpret that the system is less entangled\nbecause of the fractal geometry.\n", "  Self-consistent perturbation expansion up to the second order in the\ninteraction strength is used to study a single-level quantum dot with local\nCoulomb repulsion attached asymmetrically to two generally different\nsuperconducting leads. At zero temperature and wide range of other parameters\nthe spin-symmetric version of the expansion yields excellent results for the\nposition of the $0-\\pi$ impurity quantum phase transition boundary and\nJosephson current together with the energy of Andreev bound states in the\n$0$-phase as confirmed by numerical calculations using the Numerical\nRenormalisation Group method. We analytically prove that the method is\ncharge-conserving as well as thermodynamically consistent. Explicit formulas\nfor the position of the $0-\\pi$ phase boundary are presented for the\nHartree-Fock approximation as well as for its variant called Generalized Atomic\nLimit. It is shown that the Generalized Atomic Limit can be used as a quick\nestimate for the position of the phase boundary at half-filling in a broad\nrange of parameters. We apply our second order perturbation method to the\ninterpretation of the existing experimental data on the phase boundary with\nvery satisfactory outcome suggesting that the so far employed heavy numerical\ntools such as Numerical Renormalization Group and/or Quantum Monte Carlo are\nnot necessary in a class of generic situations and can be safely replaced by a\nperturbative approach.\n", "  We have used time-dependent density functional theory to study\nself-irradiated Si. We calculate the electronic stopping power of Si in Si by\nevaluating the energy transferred to the electrons per unit path length by an\nion of kinetic energy from $1$ eV to $100 $ keV moving through the host.\nElectronic stopping is found to be significant below the threshold velocity\nnormally identified with direct transitions across the band gap. A structured\ncrossover at low velocity exists in place of a hard threshold. An analysis of\nthe time dependence of the transition rates using coupled linear rate equations\nenables one of the excitation mechanisms to be clearly identified: a defect\nstate induced in the gap by the moving ion acts like an elevator and carries\nelectrons across the band gap.\n", "  Although self-consistent multi-configuration methods have been used for\ndecades to address the description of atomic and molecular many-body systems,\nonly a few trials have been made in the context of nuclear structure. This work\naims at the development of such an approach to describe in a unified way\nvarious types of correlations in nuclei, in a self-consistent manner where the\nmean-field is improved as correlations are introduced. The goal is to reconcile\nthe usually set apart Shell-Model and Self-Consistent Mean-Field methods. This\napproach is referred as \"variational multiparticle-multihole configuration\nmixing method\". It is based on a double variational principle which yields a\nset of two coupled equations that determine at the same time the expansion\ncoefficients of the many-body wave function and the single particle states. The\nformalism is derived and discussed in a general context, starting from a\nthree-body Hamiltonian. Links to existing many-body techniques such as the\nformalism of Green's functions are established. First applications are done\nusing the two-body D1S Gogny effective force. The numerical procedure is tested\non the $^{12}$C nucleus in order to study the convergence features of the\nalgorithm in different contexts. Ground state properties as well as\nsingle-particle quantities are analyzed, and the description of the first $2^+$\nstate is examined. This study allows to validate our numerical algorithm and\nleads to encouraging results. In order to test the method further, we will\nrealize in the second article of this series, a systematic description of more\nnuclei and observables obtained by applying the newly-developed numerical\nprocedure with the same Gogny force. As raised in the present work,\napplications of the variational multiparticle-multihole configuration mixing\nmethod will however ultimately require the use of an extended and more\nconstrained Gogny force.\n", "  The possibility that a classical space-time and quantum matter cohabit at the\ndeepest level, i.e. the possibility of having a fundamental and not\nphenomenological semiclassical gravity, is often disregarded for lack of a good\ncandidate theory. The standard semiclassical theory suffers from fundamental\ninconsistencies (e.g.: Schr\\\"odinger cat sources, faster-than-light\ncommunication and violation of the Born rule) which can only be ignored in\nsimple typical situations. We harness the power of spontaneous localization\nmodels, historically constructed to solve the measurement problem in quantum\nmechanics, to build a consistent theory of (stochastic) semiclassical gravity\nin the Newtonian limit. Our model makes quantitative and potentially testable\npredictions: we recover the Newtonian pair potential up to a short distance\ncut-off (hence we predict no 1 particle self-interaction) and uncover an\nadditional gravitational decoherence term which depends on the specifics of the\nunderlying spontaneous localization model considered. We hint at a possible\nprogram to go past the Newtonian limit, towards a consistent general\nrelativistic semiclassical gravity.\n", "  We study inflation in the framework of $f(T)$-gravity in the presence of a\ncanonical scalar field. After reviewing the basic equations governing the\nbackground cosmology in $f(T)$-gravity, we turn to study the cosmological\nperturbations and obtain the evolutionary equations for the scalar and tensor\nperturbations. Solving those equations, we find the power spectra for the\nscalar and tensor perturbations. Then, we consider a power-law form for the\n$f(T)$ function in the action and examine the inflationary models with the\npower-law and intermediate scale factors. We see that in contrast with the\nstandard inflationary scenario based on the Einstein gravity, in the considered\n$f(T)$-gravity scenario, the power-law and intermediate inflationary models can\nbe compatible with the observational results of Planck 2015 at 68\\% CL. In our\n$f(T)$-gravity setting, the potentials responsible for both the power-law and\nintermediate inflationary models have the power-law form $V(\\phi ) \\propto\n{\\phi ^m}$ but the power $m$ is different for them. Therefore, we can refine\nsome of power-law inflationary potentials in the framework of $f(T)$-gravity\nwhile they are disfavored by the observational data in the standard\ninflationary scenario. Interestingly enough, the self-interacting quartic\npotential $V(\\phi ) \\propto {\\phi ^4}$ which has special reheating properties,\ncan be consistent with the Planck 2015 data in our $f(T)$-gravity scenario\nwhile it is ruled out in the standard inflationary scenario.\n", "  Relying on an effective-string approach in which glueballs --- bound states\nof pure Yang-Mills theory --- are modelled by closed strings, we give arguments\nsuggesting that anyonic glueballs, \\textit{i.e.} glueballs with arbitrary spin,\nmay exist in $(2+1)$-$\\,$dimensional Yang-Mills theory. We then focus on the\nlarge$\\,$-$N_c$ limit of $SU$($N_c$) Yang-Mills theory and show that our model\nleads to a mass spectrum in good agreement with lattice data in the scalar\nsector, while it predicts the masses and spins of anyonic glueball states.\n", "  In this paper, using the Hojman construction, we give examples of various\nPoisson brackets which differ from those which are usually analyzed in\nHamiltonian mechanics. They possess a nonmaximal rank, and in the general case\nan invariant measure and Casimir functions can be globally absent for them.\n", "  We report results on the Young's modulus (YM) of defect-free and defective\nsilicene nanoribbons (SNRs) as a function of length and temperature. In this\nstudy, we perform molecular dynamics simulations using the\nEnvironment-Dependent Interatomic Potential (EDIP) to describe the interaction\nof the Si atoms. We find that the Young's modulus of pristine and defective\nSNRs increases with the ribbon length in both chirality directions. It is shown\nthat the Young's modulus of defective SNRs exhibit a complex dependence on the\ncombinations of vacancies. With respect to temperature, we find that YM for\nSNRs with and without vacancy defects shows a nonlinear behavior and it could\nbe tailoring for a given length and chirality.\n", "  We study the magnetic susceptibility in various three-dimensional gapless\nsystems, including Dirac and Weyl semimetals and a line-node semimetal. The\nsusceptibility is decomposed into the orbital term, the spin term and also the\nspin-orbit cross term which is caused by the spin-orbit interaction. We show\nthat the orbital susceptibility logarithmically diverges at the band touching\nenergy in the point-node case, while it exhibits a stronger delta-function\nsingularity in the line node case. The spin-orbit cross term is shown to be\nparamagnetic in the electron side while diamagnetic in the hole side, in\ncontrast with other two terms which are both even functions in Fermi energy.\nThe spin-orbit cross term in the nodal semimetal is found to be directly\nrelated to the chiral surface current induced by the topological surface modes.\n", "  Recent quantum oscillation experiments on SmB$_6$ pose a paradox, for while\nthe angular dependence of the oscillation frequencies suggest a 3D bulk Fermi\nsurface, SmB$_6$ remains robustly insulating to very high magnetic fields.\nMoreover, a sudden low temperature upturn in the amplitude of the oscillations\nraises the possibility of quantum criticality. Here we discuss recently\nproposed mechanisms for this effect, contrasting bulk and surface scenarios. We\nargue that topological surface states permit us to reconcile the various data\nwith bulk transport and spectroscopy measurements, interpreting the low\ntemperature upturn in the quantum oscillation amplitudes as a result of surface\nKondo breakdown and the high frequency oscillations as large topologically\nprotected orbits around the X point. We discuss various predictions that can be\nused to test this theory.\n", "  The canonical understanding of quantum oscillation in metals is challenged by\nthe observation of de Haas-van Alphen effect in an insulator, SmB$_{6}$ [Tan\n\\emph{et al}, Science {\\bf349}, 287 (2015)]. Based on a two-band model with\ninverted band structure, we show that the periodically narrowing hybridization\ngap in magnetic fields can induce the oscillation of low-energy density of\nstates in the bulk, which is observable provided that the hybridization gap is\nnarrow and comparable to the Landau level spacing. Its temperature dependence\nstrongly deviates from the Lifshitz-Kosevich theory. The nontrivial band\ntopology manifests itself as a nonzero Berry phase in the oscillation pattern,\nwhich crosses over to a trivial Berry phase by increasing the temperature or\nthe magnetic field. Further predictions to experiments are also proposed.\n", "  Overview of the latest theory developments presented at the Hard Probes 2015\nconference, held at McGill University, Montreal, Canada, in July 2015.\n", "  We report results of a combined investigation of thermal conductivity and\nacoustic phonon spectra in nanoporous alumina membranes with the pore diameter\ndecreasing from D=180 nm to 25 nm. The samples with the hexagonally arranged\npores were selected to have the same porosity of ~13%. The Brillouin-Mandelstam\nspectroscopy measurements revealed bulk-like phonon spectrum in the samples\nwith D=180-nm pores and spectral features, which were attributed to spatial\nconfinement, in the samples with 25-nm and 40-nm pores. The velocity of the\nlongitudinal acoustic phonons was reduced in the samples with smaller pores.\nAnalysis of the experimental data and calculated phonon dispersion suggests\nthat both phonon-boundary scattering and phonon spatial confinement affect heat\nconduction in membranes with the feature sizes D<40 nm.\n", "  The paramagnetic phase of the one-band Hubbard model is studied at\nzero-temperature, within the framework of dynamical mean-field theory, and for\ngeneral particle-hole asymmetry where a doping-induced Mott transition occurs.\nOur primary focus is the Mott insulator (MI) phase, and our main aim to\nestablish what can be shown exactly about it. To handle the locally\ndoubly-degenerate MI requires two distinct self-energies, which reflect the\nbroken symmetry nature of the phase and together determine the standard single\nself-energy. Exact results are obtained for the local charge, local magnetic\nmoment and associated spin susceptibilities, the interaction-renormalised\nlevels, and the low-energy behaviour of the self-energy in the MI phase. The\nmetallic phase is also considered briefly, and shown to acquire an emergent\nparticle-hole symmetry as the Mott transition is approached. Throughout the\nmetal, Luttinger's theorem is reflected in the vanishing of the Luttinger\nintegral; for the generic MI by contrast this is shown to be non-vanishing, but\nagain to have a universal magnitude. Numerical results are also obtained using\nNRG, for the metal/MI phase boundary, the scaling behaviour of the charge as\nthe Mott transition is aproached from the metal, and associated universal\nscaling of single-particle dynamics as the low-energy Kondo scale vanishes.\n", "  We obtain the critical magnetic field required for complete destruction of\n$S$-wave pairing in neutron matter, thereby setting limits on the pairing and\nsuperfluidity of neutrons in the crust and outer core of magnetars. We find\nthat for fields $B \\ge 10^{17}$ G the neutron fluid is non-superfluid -- if\nweaker spin-1 superfluidity does not intervene -- a result with profound\nconsequences for the thermal, rotational, and oscillatory behavior of\nmagnetars. Because the dineutron is not bound in vacuum, cold dilute neutron\nmatter cannot exhibit a proper BCS-BEC crossover. Nevertheless, owing to the\nstrongly resonant behavior of the $nn$ interaction at low densities, neutron\nmatter shows a precursor of the BEC state, as manifested in Cooper-pair\ncorrelation lengths {being} comparable to the interparticle distance. We make a\nsystematic quantitative study of this type of BCS-BEC crossover in the presence\nof neutron fluid spin-polarization induced by an ultra-strong magnetic field.\nWe evaluate the Cooper pair wave-function, quasiparticle occupation numbers,\nand quasiparticle spectra for densities and temperatures spanning the BCS-BEC\ncrossover region. The phase diagram of spin-polarized neutron matter is\nconstructed and explored at different polarizations.\n", "  Group III-V films are of great importance for their potential application in\nspintronics and quantum computing. Search for two-dimensional III-V films with\na nontrivial large-gap are quite crucial for the realization of dissipationless\ntransport edge channels using quantum spin Hall (QSH) effects. Here we use\nfirst-principles calculations to predict a class of large-gap QSH insulators in\nfunctionalized TlSb monolayers (TlSbX2; (X = H, F, Cl, Br, I)), with sizable\nbulk gaps as large as 0.22~0.40 eV. The QSH state is identified by Z2\ntopological invariant together with helical edge states induced by spin-orbit\ncoupling (SOC). Noticeably, the inverted band gap in the nontrivial states can\nbe effectively tuned by the electric field and strain. Additionally, these\nfilms on BN substrate also maintain a nontrivial QSH state, which harbors a\nDirac cone lying within the band gap. These findings may shed new light in\nfuture design and fabrication of QSH insulators based on two-dimensional\nhoneycomb lattices in spintronics.\n", "  For thermal transport in one-dimensional (1D) systems, recent studies have\nsuggested that employing different theoretical models and different numerical\nsimulations under different system's parameter regimes might lead to different\nuniversality classes of the scaling exponents. In order to well understand the\nuniversality class(es), here we perform a direct dynamics simulation for two\narchetype 1D oscillator systems with quite different phonon dispersions under\nvarious system's parameters and find that there is a crossover between the\ndifferent universality classes. We show that by varying anharmonicity and\ntemperatures, the space-time scaling exponents for the systems with different\ndispersions can be feasibly tuned in different ways. The underlying picture is\nsuggested to be understood by phonons performing various kinds of\ncontinuous-time random walks (in most cases, be the L\\'{e}vy walks but not\nalways), probably induced by the peculiar phonon dispersions along with\nnonlinearity. The results and suggested mechanisms may provide insights into\ncontrolling the transport of heat in some 1D materials.\n", "  The formalism to treat quantization and evolution of cosmological\nperturbations of multiple fluids is described. We first construct the\nLagrangian for both the gravitational and matter parts, providing the necessary\nrelevant variables and momenta leading to the quadratic Hamiltonian describing\nlinear perturbations. The final Hamiltonian is obtained without assuming any\nequations of motions for the background variables. This general formalism is\napplied to the special case of two fluids, having in mind the usual radiation\nand matter mix which made most of our current Universe history. Quantization is\nachieved using an adiabatic expansion of the basis functions. This allows for\nan unambiguous definition of a vacuum state up to the given adiabatic order.\nUsing this basis, we show that particle creation is well defined for a suitable\nchoice of vacuum and canonical variables, so that the time evolution of the\ncorresponding quantum fields is unitary. This provides constraints for setting\ninitial conditions for an arbitrary number of fluids and background time\nevolution. We also show that the common choice of variables for quantization\ncan lead to an ill-defined vacuum definition. Our formalism is not restricted\nto the case where the coupling between fields is small, but is only required to\nvary adiabatically with respect to the ultraviolet modes, thus paving the way\nto consistent descriptions of general models not restricted to single-field (or\nfluid).\n", "  The shear viscosity bound violation in Einstein gravity for anisotropic black\nbranes is discussed, with the aim of constraining the deviation of the shear\nviscosity-entropy density ratio from the shear viscosity bound using causality\nand thermodynamics analysis. The results show that no stringent constraints can\nbe imposed. The diffusion bound in anisotropic phases is also studied.\nUltimately, it is concluded that shear viscosity violation always occurs in\ncases where the equation of motion of the metric fluctuations cannot be written\nin a form identical to that of the minimally coupled massless scalar fields.\n", "  We propose a variation, based on very low energy and extremely intense photon\nsources, on the well established technique of Light-Shining-through-Wall (LSW)\nexperiments for axion-like particle searches. With radiation sources at 30 GHz,\nwe compute that present laboratory exclusion limits on axion-like particles\nmight be improved by at least four orders of magnitude, for masses m_a <~\n0.01~meV. This could motivate research and development programs on dedicated\nsingle-photon sub-THz detectors.\n", "  We study the electromagnetic (EM) transitions of the $nS$, $nP$ ($n\\leq 3$),\nand $nD$ ($n\\leq 2$) charmonium states with a constituent quark model. We\nobtain a reasonable description of the EM transitions of the well-established\ncharmonium states $J/\\psi$, $\\psi(2S)$, $\\chi_{cJ}(1P)$, $h_c(1P)$ and\n$\\psi(3770)$. We find that the M2 transitions give notable corrections to some\nE1 dominant processes by interfering with the E1 transitions. Our predictions\nof EM decay properties for the higher charmonium states are also presented and\ncompared with other model predictions. In particular, we discuss the EM decay\nproperties of some $\"XYZ\"$ states, such as $X(3823)$, $X(3872)$, $X(3915)$,\n$X(3940)$ and $X(4350)$ as conventional charmonium states. Assuming $X(3872)$\nas the $\\chi_{c1}(2P)$ state, our predicted ratio $\\Gamma[X(3872)\\to\n\\psi(2S)\\gamma]/\\Gamma[X(3872)\\to J/\\psi \\gamma]\\simeq 4.0$ is consistent with\nBaBar's measurement.\n", "  We discuss a scheme to implement the relaxion solution to the hierarchy\nproblem with multiple axions, and present a UV-completed model realizing the\nscheme. All of the $N$ axions in our model are periodic with a similar decay\nconstant $f$ well below the Planck scale. In the limit $N\\gg 1$, the relaxion\n$\\phi$ corresponds to an exponentially long multi-helical flat direction which\nis shaped by a series of mass mixing between nearby axions in the compact field\nspace of $N$ axions. With the length of flat direction given by $\\Delta \\phi\n=2\\pi f_{\\rm eff} \\sim e^{\\xi N} f$ for $\\xi={\\cal O}(1)$, both the scalar\npotential driving the evolution of $\\phi$ during the inflationary epoch and the\n$\\phi$-dependent Higgs boson mass vary with an exponentially large periodicity\nof ${\\cal O}(f_{\\rm eff})$, while the back reaction potential stabilizing the\nrelaxion has a periodicity of ${\\cal O}( f)$. A natural UV completion of our\nscheme can be found in high scale or (mini) split supersymmetry (SUSY) scenario\nwith the axion scales generated by SUSY breaking as $f\\sim \\sqrt{m_{\\rm\nSUSY}M_*}$, where the soft SUSY breaking scalar mass $m_{\\rm SUSY}$ can be well\nabove the weak scale, and the fundamental scale $M_*$ can be identified as the\nPlanck scale or the GUT scale.\n", "  In this analysis, we present the contribution associated with the\nchromomagnetic dipole operator O_8 to the double differential decay width\nd\\Gamma/(ds_1 ds_2) for the inclusive process $\\bar{B} \\to X_s \\gamma \\gamma$.\nThe kinematical variables s_1 and s_2 are defined as s_i=(p_b - q_i)^2/m_b^2,\nwhere p_b, q_1, q_2 are the momenta of b-quark and two photons. This\ncontribution (taken at tree level) is of order \\alpha_s, like the recently\ncalculated QCD corrections to the contribution of the operator O_7. In order to\nregulate possible collinear singularities of one of the photons with the\nstrange quark, we introduce a non zero mass m_s for the strange quark. Our\nresults are obtained for exact m_s, which we interpret as a constituent mass\nbeing varied between 400 and 600 MeV. Numerically it turns out that the effect\nof the (O_8, O_8) contribution to the branching ratio of $\\bar{B} \\to X_s\n\\gamma \\gamma$ does not exceed +0.1 % for any kinematically allowed value of\nour physical cutoff parameter c, confirming the expected suppression of this\ncontribution relative to the QCD corrections to d\\Gamma_{77}/(ds_1 ds_2).\n", "  Superradiance, i.e., spontaneous emission of coherent radiation by an\nensemble of identical two-level atoms in collective states introduced by Dicke\nin 1954, is one of the enigmatic problems of quantum optics. The startling gist\nis that even though the atoms have no dipole moment they radiate with increased\nintensity in particular directions. Following the advances in our understanding\nof superradiant emission by atoms in entangled $W$ states we examine the\nquantum statistical properties of superradiance. Such investigations require\nthe system to have at least two excitations as one needs to explore the\nphoton-photon correlations of the radiation emitted by such states. We present\nspecifically results for the spatially resolved photon-photon correlations of\nsystems prepared in doubly excited $W$ states and give conditions when the\natomic system emits nonclassial light. Equally, we derive the conditions for\nthe occurrence of bunching and even of superbunching, a rare phenomenon\notherwise known only from nonclassical states of light like the squeezed\nvacuum. We finally investigate the photon-photon cross correlations of the\nspontaneously scattered light and highlight the nonclassicalty of such\ncorrelations.\n", "  The level density and gamma-ray strength function (gammaSF) of 243Pu have\nbeen measured in the quasi-continuum using the Oslo method. Excited states in\n243Pu were populated using the 242Pu(d,p) reaction. The level density closely\nfollows the constant-temperature level density formula for excitation energies\nabove the pairing gap. The gammaSF displays a double-humped resonance at low\nenergy as also seen in previous investigations of actinide isotopes. The\nstructure is interpreted as the scissors resonance and has a centroid of\nomega_{SR}=2.42(5)MeV and a total strength of B_{SR}=10.1(15)mu_N^2, which is\nin excellent agreement with sum-rule estimates. The measured level density and\ngammaSF were used to calculate the 242Pu(n,gamma) cross section in a neutron\nenergy range for which there were previously no measured data.\n", "  We revisit the most general theory for a massive vector field with derivative\nself-interactions, extending previous works on the subject to account for terms\nhaving trivial total derivative interactions for the longitudinal mode. In the\nflat spacetime (Minkowski) case, we obtain all the possible terms containing\nproducts of up to five first-order derivatives of the vector field, and provide\na conjecture about higher-order terms. Rendering the metric dynamical, we\ncovariantize the results and add all possible terms implying curvature.\n", "  Characterization of strain in two-dimensional (2D) crystals is important for\nunderstanding their properties and performance. Using first-principles\ncalculations, we study the effects of uniaxial strain on the Raman-active modes\nin monolayer MoS$_2$. We show that the in-plane $E'$ mode at 384 cm$^{-1}$ and\nthe out-of-plane $A_1'$ mode at 403 cm$^{-1}$ can serve as fingerprints for the\nuniaxial strain in this 2D material. Specifically, under a uniaxial strain, the\ndoubly degenerate $E'$ mode splits into two non-degenerate modes: one is\n$E_{\\parallel}'$ mode in which atoms vibrate in parallel to the strain\ndirection, and the other is $E_\\perp'$ mode in which atoms vibrate\nperpendicular to the strain direction. The frequency of the $E_{\\parallel}'$\nmode blue-shifts for a compressive strain, but red-shifts for a tensile strain.\nIn addition, due to the strain-induced anisotropy in the MoS$_2$ lattice, the\npolarized Raman spectra of the $E_{\\parallel}'$ and $E_{\\perp}'$ modes exhibit\ndistinct angular dependence for specific laser polarization setups, allowing\nfor a precise determination of the direction of the uniaxial strain with\nrespect to the crystallographic orientation. Furthermore, we find that the\npolarized Raman intensity of the $A_1'$ mode also shows evident dependence on\nthe applied strain, providing additional effective clues for determining the\ndirection of the strain even without knowledge of the crystallographic\norientation. Thus, polarized Raman spectroscopy offers an efficient\nnon-destructive way to characterize the uniaxial strains in monolayer MoS$_2$.\n", "  Gravitational collapse of a massless scalar field in spherically symmetric\nanti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetimes presents a new phenomenology with a series of\ncritical points whose dynamics is discretely self-similar as in the\nasymptotically flat case. Each critical point is the limit of a branch of\nscalar field configurations that have bounced off the AdS boundary a fixed\nnumber of times before forming an apparent horizon. We present results from a\nnumerical study that focus on the interfaces between branches. We find that\nthere is a mass gap between branches and that subcritical configurations near\nthe critical point form black holes with an apparent horizon mass that follows\na power law of the form $M_{AH}-M_{g} \\propto (p_{c}-p)^{\\xi}$, where $M_g$ is\nthe mass gap and the exponent $\\xi\\simeq 0.7$ appears to be universal.\n", "  The Einstein-Hilbert theory of gravity can be rephrased by focusing on local\nconformal symmetry as an exact, but spontaneously broken symmetry of nature.\nThe conformal component of the metric field is then treated as a dilaton field\nwith only renormalizable interactions. This imposes constraints on the theory,\nwhich can also be viewed as demanding regularity of the action as the dilaton\nfield variable tends to 0. In other words, we have constraints on the small\ndistance behaviour. Our procedure appears to turn a black hole into a regular,\ntopologically trivial soliton without singularities, horizons of firewalls, but\nmany questions remain.\n", "  Events in the solar corona are often widely separated in their timescales,\nwhich can allow them to be identified when they would otherwise be confused\nwith emission from other sources in the corona. Methods for cleanly separating\nsuch events based on their timescales are thus desirable for research in the\nfield. This paper develops a technique for identifying time-varying signals in\nsolar coronal image sequences which is based on a per-pixel running median\nfilter and an understanding of photon-counting statistics. Example applications\nto 'EIT Waves' and small-scale dynamics are shown, both using data from the 193\nAngstrom channel on AIA. The technique is found to discriminate EIT Waves more\ncleanly than the running and base difference techniques most commonly used. It\nis also demonstrated that there is more signal in the data than is commonly\nappreciated, finding that the waves can be traced to the edge of the AIA field\nof view when the data are rebinned to increase the signal-to-noise ratio.\n", "  In the present paper we study the production of $\\chi_b + c\\bar c$ at the LHC\nwithin single parton scattering approach. A special attention payed to the\nfeed-down from $\\chi_b$ states to the associated $\\Upsilon + c\\bar c$\nproduction, which was recently studied by the LHCb. We have found that this\nfeed-down is about percents of the total cross section seen in the experiment.\nIt is shown that the shapes of the differential distributions are almost same\nas found by the LHCb except the azimuthal asymmetry, which is almost flat in\nthe experiment. We conclude that the precise study of the single parton\nscattering contributions is necessary for the correct isolation of other\npossible production channels such as double parton scattering.\n", "  We present detailed theoretical study on zero-frequency Drude weight and\noptical conductivity of a two-dimensional heavy-hole gas(2DHG) with $k$-cubic\nRashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit interactions. The presence of $k$-cubic\nspin-orbit couplings strongly modifies the Drude weight in comparison to the\nelectron gas with $k$-linear spin-orbit couplings. For large hole density and\nstrong $k$-cubic spin-orbit couplings, the density dependence of Drude weight\ndeviates from the linear behavior. We establish a relation between optical\nconductivity and the Berry connection. Unlike two-dimensional electron gas with\n$k$-linear spin-orbit couplings, we explicitly show that the optical\nconductivity does not vanish even for equal strength of the two spin-orbit\ncouplings. We attribute this fact to the non-zero Berry phase for equal\nstrength of $k$-cubic spin-orbit couplings. The least photon energy needed to\nset in the optical transition in hole gas is one order of magnitude smaller\nthan that of electron gas. Types of two van Hove singularities appear in the\noptical spectrum are also discussed.\n", "  Ultracold atomic Fermi gases have been a popular topic of research, with\nattention being paid recently to two-dimensional (2D) gases. In this work, we\nperform T=0 ab initio diffusion Monte Carlo calculations for a strongly\ninteracting two-component Fermi gas confined to two dimensions. We first go\nover finite-size systems and the connection to the thermodynamic limit. After\nthat, we illustrate pertinent 2D scattering physics and properties of the wave\nfunction. We then show energy results for the strong-coupling crossover, in\nbetween the Bose-Einstein Condensation (BEC) and Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer\n(BCS) regimes. Our energy results for the BEC-BCS crossover are parametrized to\nproduce an equation of state, which is used to determine Tan's contact. We\ncarry out a detailed comparison with other microscopic results. Finally, we\ncalculate the pairing gap for a range of interaction strengths in the strong\ncoupling regime, following from variationally optimized many-body wave\nfunctions.\n", "  We consider a model of neutrino mass with a scalar triplet\n$(\\xi^{++},\\xi^+,\\xi^0)$ assigned lepton number $L=0$, so that the tree-level\nYukawa coupling $\\xi^0 \\nu_i \\nu_j$ is not allowed. It is generated instead\nthrough the interaction of $\\xi$ and $\\nu$ with dark matter and the soft\nbreaking of $L$ to $(-1)^L$. We discuss the phenomenological implications of\nthis model, including $\\xi^{++}$ decay and the prognosis of discovering the\ndark sector at the Large Hadron Collider.\n", "  The charged lepton flavor violation process is a clean and sensitive probe of\nnew physics beyond the Standard Model. A sensitivity study is performed to the\nprocess $\\tau^- \\to \\gamma \\mu^-$ based on a 3~fb$^{-1}$ inclusive Monte Carlo\nsample of $e^+e^-$ collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 4.26 or 4.6~GeV, in\nthe framework of the BESIII software system. The 90\\% confidence level upper\nlimits on $\\BR(\\tau^- \\to \\gamma \\mu^-)$ are estimated assuming no signal is\nproduced. We also obtain the sensitivity on $\\BR(\\tau^- \\to \\gamma \\mu^-)$ as a\nfunction of the integrated luminosity, to serve as a reference for the HIEPA\nbeing proposed in China. It is found that 6.34~ab$^{-1}$ are needed to reach\nthe current best upper limit of $4.4\\times 10^{-8}$ and about 2510~ab$^{-1}$\nare needed to reach a sensitivity of $10^{-9}$ if the detector design is\nsimilar to that of BESIII.\n", "  We consider a new formulation of the stochastic coupled cluster method in\nterms of the similarity transformed Hamiltonian. We show that improvement in\nthe granularity with which the wavefunction is represented results in a\nreduction in the critical population required to correctly sample the\nwavefunction for a range of systems and excitation levels and hence leads to a\nsubstantial reduction in the computational cost. This development has the\npotential to substantially extend the range of the method, enabling it to be\nused to treat larger systems with excitation levels not easily accessible with\nconventional deterministic methods.\n", "  Quantum algorithms for scientific computing require modules implementing\nfundamental functions, such as the square root, the logarithm, and others. We\nrequire algorithms that have a well-controlled numerical error, that are\nuniformly scalable and reversible (unitary), and that can be implemented\nefficiently. We present quantum algorithms and circuits for computing the\nsquare root, the natural logarithm, and arbitrary fractional powers. We provide\nperformance guarantees in terms of their worst-case accuracy and cost. We\nfurther illustrate their performance by providing tests comparing them to the\nrespective floating point implementations found in widely used numerical\nsoftware.\n", "  A torsion-bar antenna (TOBA) is a low-frequency terrestrial gravitational\nwave (GW) antenna which consists of two orthogonal bar-shaped test masses. We\nupgraded the prototype TOBA and achieved the strain sensitivity $10^{-10}$\nHz$^{-1/2}$ at around 1 Hz. We operated the upgraded TOBA (called the \"Phase-II\nTOBA\") located at Tokyo in Japan for 22.5 hours and performed an all-sky\ncoherent search for continuous GWs using the $\\mathcal{F}$-statistic. We place\nupper limits on continuous GWs from electromagnetically unknown sources in the\nfrequency range from 6 Hz to 7 Hz with the first derivative of frequency less\nthan $7.62 \\times 10^{-11}$ Hz/s using data from the TOBA. As a result, no\nsignificant GW signals are found in the frequency band 6-7 Hz. The most\nstringent upper limit upper limit on the dimensionless GW strain with 95%\nconfidence level in this band is $3.6 \\times 10^{-12}$ at 6.84 Hz.\n", "  Monodromy matrices of the $\\tau_2$ model are known to satisfy a Yang--Baxter\nequation with a six-vertex $R$-matrix as the intertwiner. The commutation\nrelations of the elements of the monodromy matrices are completely determined\nby this $R$-matrix. We show the reason why in the superintegrable case the\neigenspace is degenerate, but not in the general case. We then show that the\neigenspaces of special CSOS models descending from the chiral Potts model are\nalso degenerate. The existence of an $L({\\mathfrak{sl}}_2)$ quantum loop\nalgebra (or subalgebra) in these models is established by showing that the\nSerre relations hold for the generators. The highest weight polynomial (or the\nDrinfeld polynomial) of the representation is obtained by using the method of\nBaxter for the superintegrable case. As a byproduct, the eigenvalues of all\nsuch CSOS models are given explicitly.\n", "  The next generation of ground and space-based telescopes will image habitable\nplanets around nearby stars. A growing literature describes how to characterize\nsuch planets with spectroscopy, but less consideration has been given to the\nusefulness of planet colors. Here, we investigate whether potentially\nEarth-like exoplanets could be identified using UV-visible-to-NIR wavelength\nbroadband photometry (350-1000 nm). Specifically, we calculate optimal\nphotometric bins for identifying an exo-Earth and distinguishing it from\nuninhabitable planets including both Solar System objects and model exoplanets.\nThe color of some hypothetical exoplanets - particularly icy terrestrial worlds\nwith thick atmospheres - is similar to Earth's because of Rayleigh scattering\nin the blue region of the spectrum. Nevertheless, subtle features in Earth's\nreflectance spectrum appear to be unique. In particular, Earth's reflectance\nspectrum has a 'U-shape' unlike all our hypothetical, uninhabitable planets.\nThis shape is partly biogenic because O2-rich, oxidizing air is transparent to\nsunlight, allowing prominent Rayleigh scattering, while ozone absorbs visible\nlight, creating the bottom of the 'U'. Whether such uniqueness has practical\nutility depends on observational noise. If observations are photon limited or\ndominated by astrophysical sources (zodiacal light or imperfect starlight\nsuppression), then the use of broadband visible wavelength photometry to\nidentify Earth twins has little practical advantage over obtaining detailed\nspectra. However, if observations are dominated by dark current then optimized\nphotometry could greatly assist preliminary characterization. We also calculate\nthe optimal photometric bins for identifying extrasolar Archean Earths, and\nfind that the Archean Earth is more difficult to unambiguously identify than a\nmodern Earth twin.\n", "  Single photon sources (SPS) are a fundamental building block for optical\nimplementations of quantum information protocols. Among SPSs, multiple crystal\nheralded single photon sources seem to give the best compromise between high\npair production rate and low multiple photon events. In this work, we study\ntheir performance in a practical quantum key distribution experiment, by\nevaluating the achievable key rates. The analysis focuses on the two different\nschemes, symmetric and asymmetric, proposed for the practical implementation of\nheralded single photon sources, with attention on the performance of their\ncomposing elements. The analysis is based on the protocol proposed by Bennett\nand Brassard in 1984 and on its improvement exploiting decoy state technique.\nFinally, a simple way of exploiting the post-selection mechanism for a passive,\none decoy state scheme is evaluated.\n", "  We present muon spin rotation ($\\mu$SR) and susceptibility measurements on\nsingle crystals of isoelectronically doped URu$_{2-x}$T$_x$Si$_2$ (T = Fe, Os)\nfor doping levels up to 50\\%. Zero Field (ZF) $\\mu$SR measurements show\nlong-lived oscillations demonstrating that an antiferromagnetic state exists\ndown to low doping levels for both Os and Fe dopants. The measurements further\nshow an increase in the internal field with doping for both Fe and Os.\nComparison of the local moment - hybridization crossover temperature from\nsusceptibility measurements and our magnetic transition temperature shows that\nchanges in hybridization, rather than solely chemical pressure, are important\nin driving the evolution of magnetic order with doping.\n", "  We propose to use the effect of measurements instead of their number to study\nthe time evolution of quantum systems under monitoring. This time redefinition\nacts like a microscope which blows up the inner details of seemingly\ninstantaneous transitions like quantum jumps. In the simple example of a\ncontinuously monitored qubit coupled to a heat bath, we show that this\nprocedure provides well defined and simple evolution equations in an otherwise\nsingular strong monitoring limit. We show that there exists anomalous\nobservable localised on sharp transitions which can only be resolved with our\nnew effective time. We apply our simplified description to study the\ncompetition between information extraction and dissipation in the evolution of\nthe linear entropy. Finally, we show that the evolution of the new time as a\nfunction of the real time is closely related to a stable Levy process of index\n1/2.\n", "  We present a solid-state laser system that generates over 200 mW of\ncontinuous-wave, narrowband light, tunable from 316.3 nm - 317.7 nm and 318.0\nnm - 319.3 nm. The laser is based on commercially available fiber amplifiers\nand optical frequency doubling technology, along with sum frequency generation\nin a periodically poled stoichiometric lithium tantalate crystal. The laser\nfrequency is stabilized to an atomic-referenced high finesse optical transfer\ncavity. Using a GPS-referenced optical frequency comb we measure a long term\nfrequency instability of $<$35 kHz for timescales between $10^{-3}$ s and\n$10^3$ s. As an application we perform spectroscopy of Sr Rydberg states from\n$n$ = 37 - 81, demonstrating mode-hop-free scans of 24 GHz. In a cold atomic\nsample we measure Doppler-limited linewidths of 350 kHz.\n", "  A Regge pole model for Pomeron-Pomeron total cross section in the resonance\nregion $\\sqrt{M^2}\\le$ 5 GeV is presented. The cross section is saturated by\ndirect-channel contributions from the Pomeron as well as from two different $f$\ntrajectories, accompanied by the isolated f$_0(500)$ resonance which dominates\nthe $\\sqrt{M^{2}}\\lesssim 1$ GeV region. A slowly varying background is taken\ninto account. The calculated Pomeron-Pomeron total cross section cannot be\nmeasured directly, but is an essential part of central diffractive processes.\nIn preparation of future calculations of central resonance production at the\nhadron level, and corresponding measurements at the LHC, we normalize the\nPomeron-Pomeron cross section at large masses $\\sigma_{t}^{PP}\n(\\sqrt{M^2}\\rightarrow \\infty) \\approx$ 1 mb as suggested by QCD-motivated\nestimates.\n", "  Proteolysis of the multimeric blood coagulation protein von Willebrand Factor\n(VWF) by ADAMTS13 is crucial for prevention of microvascular thrombosis.\nADAMTS13 cleaves VWF within the mechanosensitive A2 domain, which is believed\nto open under shear flow. Here, we combine Fluorescence Correlation\nSpectroscopy (FCS) and a microfluidic shear cell to monitor real-time kinetics\nof full-length VWF proteolysis as a function of shear stress. For comparison,\nwe also measure the Michaelis-Menten kinetics of ADAMTS13 cleavage of wild-type\nVWF in the absence of shear but partially denaturing conditions. Under shear,\nADAMTS13 activity on full-length VWF arises without denaturing agent as\nevidenced by FCS and gel-based multimer analysis. In agreement with Brownian\nhydrodynamics simulations, we find a sigmoidal increase of the enzymatic rate\nas a function of shear at a threshold shear rate 5522/s. The same flow-rate\ndependence of ADAMTS13 activity we also observe in blood plasma, which is\nrelevant to predict hemostatic dysfunction.\n", "  We observed the J = 9-8 and 16-15 rotational transitions of the normal\nspecies and five 13C isotopologues of HC5N to study its formation mechanisms\ntoward the cyanopolyyne peak in Taurus Molecular Cloud-1, with the 45-m radio\ntelescope of Nobeyama Radio Observatory. We detected the five 13C isotopologues\nwith high signal-to-noise ratios between 12 and 20, as well as the normal\nspecies. The abundance ratios of the five 13C isotopologues of HC5N are found\nto be 1.00:0.97:1.03:1.05:1.16 (0.19) for\n[H13CCCCCN]:[HC13CCCCN]:[HCC13CCCN]:[HCCC13CCN]:[HCCCC13CN]. We do not find any\nsignificant differences among the five 13C isotopologues. The averaged\n[HC5N]/[13C isotopologues] abundance ratio is determined to be 94 (6), which is\nslightly higher than the local interstellar elemental 12C/13C ratio of 60-70.\nPossible formation pathways are discussed on the basis of these results.\n", "  Exploration of the unusual properties of the two-dimensional materials\nsilicene and germanene is a very active research field in recent years. This\narticle therefore reviews the latest developments, focusing both on the\nfundamental materials properties and on possible applications.\n", "  An outline of the basic Riemannian structures underlying the separation of\nvariables in the Hamilton-Jacobi equation of natural Hamiltonian systems.\n", "  Single layers of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are direct gap\nsemiconductors with nondegenerate valley indices. An intriguing possibility for\nthese materials is the use of their valley index as an alternate state\nvariable. Several limitations to such a utility include strong, phonon-enabled\nintervalley scattering, as well as multiparticle interactions leading to\nmultiple emission channels. We prepare single-layer WS$_{2}$ such that the\nphotoluminescence is from either the neutral or charged exciton (trion). After\nexcitation with circularly polarized light, the neutral exciton emission has\nzero polarization, however, the trion emission has a large polarization (28%)\nat room temperature. The trion emission also has a unique, non-monotonic\ntemperature dependence that we show is a consequence of the multiparticle\nnature of the trion. This temperature dependence enables us to determine that\ncoulomb assisted intervalley scattering, electron-hole radiative recombination,\nand a 3-particle Auger process are the dominant mechanisms at work in this\nsystem. Because this dependence involves trion systems, one can use gate\nvoltages to modulate the polarization (or intensity) emitted from TMD\nstructures.\n", "  In this paper we consider an elementary, and largely unexplored,\ncombinatorial problem in low-dimensional topology. Consider a real\n2-dimensional compact surface $S$, and fix a number of points $F$ on its\nboundary. We ask: how many configurations of disjoint arcs are there on $S$\nwhose boundary is $F$?\n  We find that this enumerative problem, counting curves on surfaces, has a\nrich structure. For instance, we show that the curve counts obey an effective\nrecursion, in the general framework of topological recursion. Moreover, they\nexhibit quasi-polynomial behaviour.\n  This \"elementary curve-counting\" is in fact related to a more advanced notion\nof \"curve-counting\" from algebraic geometry or symplectic geometry. The\nasymptotics of this enumerative problem are closely related to the asymptotics\nof volumes of moduli spaces of curves, and the quasi-polynomials governing the\nenumerative problem encode intersection numbers on moduli spaces.\n  Furthermore, among several other results, we show that generating functions\nand differential forms for these curve counts exhibit structure that is\nreminiscent of the mathematical physics of free energies, partition functions,\ntopological recursion, and quantum curves.\n", "  We use self-consistent numerical simulations of the evolution and disruption\nof the Sun's birth cluster in the Milky Way potential to investigate the\npresent-day phase space distribution of the Sun's siblings. The simulations\ninclude the gravitational N-body forces within the cluster and the effects of\nstellar evolution on the cluster population. In addition the gravitational\nforces due to the Milky Way potential are accounted for in a self-consistent\nmanner. Our aim is to understand how the astrometric and radial velocity data\nfrom the Gaia mission can be used to pre-select solar sibling candidates. We\nvary the initial conditions of the Sun's birth cluster, as well as the\nparameters of the Galactic potential. We show that the disruption time-scales\nof the cluster are insensitive to the details of the non-axisymmetric\ncomponents of the Milky Way model and we make predictions, averaged over the\ndifferent simulated possibilities, about the number of solar siblings that\nshould appear in surveys such as Gaia or GALAH. We find a large variety of\npresent-day phase space distributions of solar siblings, which depend on the\ncluster initial conditions and the Milky Way model parameters. We show that\nnevertheless robust predictions can be made about the location of the solar\nsiblings in the space of parallaxes ($\\varpi$), proper motions ($\\mu$) and\nradial velocities ($V_\\mathrm{r}$). By calculating the ratio of the number of\nsimulated solar siblings to that of the number of stars in a model Galactic\ndisk, we find that this ratio is above 0.5 in the region given by: $\\varpi \\geq\n5$mas, $4 \\leq \\mu \\leq 6$masyr$^{-1}$, and $-2\\leq V_\\mathrm{r} \\leq\n0$kms$^{-1}$. Selecting stars from this region should increase the probability\nof success in identifying solar siblings through follow up observations\n[Abridged].\n", "  Phyllotaxis describes the arrangement of florets, scales or leaves in\ncomposite flowers or plants (daisy, aster, sunflower, pinecone, pineapple). As\na structure, it is a geometrical foam, the most homogeneous and densest\ncovering of a large disk by Voronoi cells (the florets), constructed by a\nsimple algorithm: Points placed regularly on a generative spiral constitute a\nspiral lattice, and phyllotaxis is the tiling by the Voronoi cells of the\nspiral lattice. Locally, neighboring cells are organized as three whorls or\nparastichies, labeled with successive Fibonacci numbers. The structure is\nencoded as the sequence of the shapes (number of sides) of the successive\nVoronoi cells on the generative spiral. We show that sequence and organization\nare independent of the position of the initial point on the generative spiral,\nthat is invariant under disappearance ($T2$) of the first Voronoi cell or,\nconversely, under creation of a first cell, that is under growth. This\nindependence shows how a foam is able to respond to a shear stress, notably\nthrough grain boundaries that are layers of square cells slightly truncated\ninto heptagons, pentagons and hexagons, meeting at four-corner vertices,\ncritical points of $T1$ elementary topological transformations.\n", "  A large mass expansion of the one-loop effective action of a scalar field on\nthe two-dimensional Minkowski spacetime is found in the system of coordinates,\nwhere the metric $g_{\\mu\\nu}(t,x)\\neq\\eta_{\\mu\\nu}=diag(1,-1)$, and\n$g_{\\mu\\nu}(t,x)$ tends to $\\eta_{\\mu\\nu}$ at the spatial and temporal\ninfinities. It is shown that, apart from the Coleman-Weinberg potential, this\nexpansion contains the terms both analytic and non-analytic in $m^{-2}$, where\n$m$ is the mass of a scalar field. A general unambiguous expression for the\none-loop correction to the effective action on non-stationary backgrounds is\nderived.\n", "  We demonstrate that amplitudes based on matter supermultiplets can be\ncombined to provide amplitudes of vector supermultiplets by means of KLT\nrelations. In practice we do this by developing a procedure for removing\nsupersymmetry supercharges from super Yang-Mills theory and supergravity\nsupermultiplets, reducing them to vector and chiral supermultiplets\nrespectively. This way, we reduce the super KLT relations to chiral KLT\nrelations making chiral squaring of amplitudes manifest. We study these chiral\nKLT relations, discussing permutation symmetry and vanishing relations. Finally\nsome explicit calculations are done to show how the relations work in detail.\n", "  An extended version of the BPS Skyrme model that admits time-dependent\nsolutions is discussed. Initially, by introducing a power law at the original\npotential term of the BPS Skyrme model the existence, stability and structure\nof the corresponding solutions is investigated. Then, the frequencies and\nhalf-lifes of the radial oscillations of the constructed time-dependent\nsolutions are determined.\n", "  We present the results of high-resolution near-IR spectroscopy toward the\nmultiple outflows around the Herbig Be star Lk{\\Ha} 234 using the Immersion\nGrating Infrared Spectrograph (IGRINS). Previous studies indicate that the\nregion around Lk{\\Ha} 234 is complex, with several embedded YSOs and the\noutflows associated with them. In simultaneous H$-$ and K$-$band spectra from\nHH 167, we detected 5 {\\FeII} and 14 H$_{2}$ emission lines. We revealed a new\n{\\FeII} jet driven by radio continuum source VLA 3B. Position-velocity diagrams\nof H$_{2}$ 1$-$0 S(1) $\\lambda$2.122 $\\micron$ line show multiple velocity\npeaks. The kinematics may be explained by a geometrical bow shock model. We\ndetected a component of H$_{2}$ emission at the systemic velocity (V$_{LSR}$\n$=$ $-$10.2 {\\kms}) along the whole slit in all slit positions, which may arise\nfrom the ambient photodissociation region. Low-velocity gas dominates the\nmolecular hydrogen emission from knots A and B in HH 167, which is close to the\nsystemic velocity, {\\FeII} emission lines are detected at farther from the\nsystemic velocity, at V$_{LSR}$ $=$ $-$100 $-$ $-$130 {\\kms}. We infer that the\nH$_{2}$ emission arises from shocked gas entrained by a high-velocity outflow.\nPopulation diagrams of H$_{2}$ lines imply that the gas is thermalized at a\ntemperature of 2,500 $-$ 3,000 K and the emission results from shock\nexcitation.\n", "  The firewall was introduced into black hole evaporation scenarios as a deus\nex machina designed to break entanglements and preserve unitarity (Almheiri\net.al., 2013). Here we show that the firewall actually exists and does break\nentanglements, but only in the context of a virtual reality for observers\nstationed near the horizon, who are following the long-term evolution of the\nhole. These observers are heated by acceleration radiation at the Unruh\ntemperature and see pair creation at the horizon as a high-energy phenomenon.\nThe objective reality is very different. We argue that Hawking pair creation is\nentirely a low-energy process in which entanglements never arise. The Hawking\nparticles materialize as low-energy excitations with typical wavelength\nconsiderably larger than the black hole radius. They thus emerge into a very\nnon-uniform environment inimical to entanglement-formation.\n", "  Stochastic phenotype switching has been suggested to play a beneficial role\nin microbial populations by leading to the division of labour among cells, or\nensuring that at least some of the population survives an unexpected change in\nenvironmental conditions. Here we use a computational model to investigate an\nalternative possible function of stochastic phenotype switching - as a way to\nadapt more quickly even in a static environment. We show that when a genetic\nmutation causes a population to become less fit, switching to an alternative\nphenotype with higher fitness (growth rate) may give the population enough time\nto develop compensatory mutations that increase the fitness again. The\npossibility of switching phenotypes can reduce the time to adaptation by orders\nof magnitude if the \"fitness valley\" caused by the deleterious mutation is deep\nenough. Our work has important implications for the emergence of\nantibiotic-resistant bacteria. In line with recent experimental findings we\nhypothesise that switching to a slower growing but less sensitive phenotype\nhelps bacteria to develop resistance by exploring a larger set of beneficial\nmutations while avoiding deleterious ones.\n", "  Increase in the Balmer continuum radiation during solar flares was predicted\nby various authors but never firmly confirmed observationally using\nground-based slit spectrographs. Here we describe a new post-focal instrument -\nImage Selector - enabling to measure the Balmer continuum flux from the whole\nflare area, in analogy of successful detections of flaring dMe stars. The\nsystem was developed and put into operation at the horizontal solar telescope\nHSFA-2 of the Ond\\v{r}ejov Observatory. We measure the total flux by a fast\nspectrometer from a limited but well defined region on the solar disk. Using a\nsystem of diaphragms, the disturbing contribution of a bright solar disk can be\neliminated as much as possible. Light curves of the measured flux in the\nspectral range 350 - 440 nm are processed, together with the H{\\alpha} images\nof the flaring area delimited by the appropriate diaphragm. The spectral flux\ndata are flat-fielded, calibrated and processed to be compared with model\npredictions. Our analysis of the data proves that the described device is\nsufficiently sensitive to detect variations in the Balmer continuum during\nsolar flares. Assuming that the Balmer-continuum kernels have at least a\nsimilar size as those visible in H\\alpha, we find the flux increase in the\nBalmer continuum to reach 230 % - 550 % of the quiet continuum during the\nobserved X-class flare. We also found temporal changes in the Balmer continuum\nflux starting well before the onset of the flare in H{\\alpha}.\n", "  We propose an experimentally feasible scheme for generating entangled\nterahertz photon pairs in topological insulator quantum dots (TIQDs). We\ndemonstrate theoretically that in generic TIQDs: 1) the fine structure\nsplitting, which is the obstacle to produce entangled photons in conventional\nsemiconductor quantum dots, is inherently absent for one-dimensional massless\nexcitons due to the time-reversal symmetry; 2) the selection rules obey winding\nnumber conservation instead of the conventional angular momentum conservation\nbetween edge states with a linear dispersion. With these two advantages, the\nentanglement of the emitted photons during the cascade in our scheme is robust\nagainst unavoidable disorders and irregular shapes of the TIQDs.\n", "  The dimer Mott insulator $\\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$Cu$_2$(CN)$_3$ exhibits\nunusual electrodynamic properties. Numerical investigations of the electronic\nground state and the molecular and lattice vibrations reveal the importance of\nthe Cu$_2$(CN)$_3^-$ anion network coupled to the BEDT-TTF molecules: The\nthreefold cyanide coordination of copper and linkage isomerism in the anion\nstructure cause a loss of symmetry, frustration, disorder, and domain\nformation. Our findings consistently explain the temperature and\npolarization-dependent THz and infrared measurements, reinforce the\nunderstanding of dielectric properties and have important implications for the\nquantum spin-liquid state, which should be treated beyond two-dimensional,\npurely electronic models.\n", "  In this paper we prove that the pressure beneath an extreme Stokes wave over\nfinite depth is strictly increasing with depth. Additionally it is shown that\nthe pressure decreases in moving between a crest-line and trough-line, while it\nis stationary with respect to the horizontal coordinate along these lines\nthemselves.\n", "  In this thesis, the connection between recently introduced algebraic\nstructures (tridiagonal algebra, $q$-Onsager algebra, generalized $q-$Onsager\nalgebras), related representation theory (tridiagonal pair, Leonard pair,\northogonal polynomials), some properties of these algebras and the analysis of\nrelated quantum integrable models on the lattice (the $XXZ$ open spin chain at\nroots of unity) is first reviewed. Then, the main results of the thesis are\ndescribed: (i) for the class of $q-$Onsager algebras associated with\n$\\widehat{sl_2}$ and ADE type simply-laced affine Lie algebras, higher order\nanalogs of Lusztig's relations are conjectured and proven in various cases,\n(ii) for the open $XXZ$ spin chain at roots of unity, new elements (that are\ndivided polynomials of $q-$Onsager generators) are introduced and some of their\nproperties are studied. These two elements together with the two basic elements\nof the $q-$Onsager algebra generate a new algebra, which can be understood as\nan analog of Lusztig's quantum group for the $q-$Onsager algebra. Some\nperspectives are presented.\n", "  We report on temperature- and excitation-power-dependent photoluminescence\n(PL) study of CuInS$_{2}$/ZnS nanocrystals dispersed on a SiO$_{2}$/Si\nsubstrate with a confocal micro-PL system. With increasing the excitation power\nat 22 K and room temperature, the PL spectra are blue-shifted because of the\nstate filling. At low temperature, a small peak is observed at the low energy\nside of the spectrum, which could be due to the F$\\ddot{o}$rster resonance\nenergy transfer between different nanocrystals. The integrated PL intensity\nincreases sublinearly as a function of excitation power with a power factor of\naround 2/3, which demonstrates the Auger recombination dominated process in the\nnanocrystals, especially under the high excitation power.\n", "  Compared with the MSSM or the NMSSM with a low \\lambda, \\lambda-SUSY theory\nwith a large \\lambda around one has been deemed as a most natural realization\nof NMSSM. In this work, we treat the next-to-lightest CP-even Higgs boson as\nthe SM-like Higgs boson in \\lambda-SUSY and study the properties of the Higgs\nbosons and the pair production of the SM-like Higgs boson by considering\nvarious experiment constraints. We find that naturalness plays an important\nrole in selecting the parameter space of \\lambda-SUSY. In the most natural\nregion of parameter space, the triple self coupling of the SM-like Higgs boson\ncompared with its SM prediction may get enhanced by a factor about 7, and the\nmost dominant contribution to the Higgs pair production comes from the triple\nself coupling of the SM-like Higgs boson and the production rate can be greatly\nenhanced, maximally 10 times larger than the SM prediction.\n", "  The recent proposal of Almheiri et al.http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.7041,\ntogether with the Ryu-Takayanagi formula, implies the entanglement wedge\nhypothesis for certain choices of boundary subregions. This fact is derived in\nthe pure AdS space. A similar conclusion holds in the presence of quantum\ncorrections, but in a more restricted domain of applicability. We also comment\non http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.05416 and some similarities and differences with\nthis work\n", "  Using ab-initio methods we investigate the possibility of three-terminal\ngraphene \"T-junction\" devices and show that these all-graphene edge contacts\nare energetically feasible when the 1D interface itself is free from foreign\natoms. We examine the energetics of various junction structures as a function\nof the atomic scale geometry. Three-terminal equilibrium Green's functions are\nused to determine the transmission spectrum and contact resistance of the\nsystem. We find that the most symmetric structures have a significant binding\nenergy, and we determine the contact resistances in the junction to be in the\nrange of 1-10 kOhm which is comparable to the best contact resistance reported\nfor edge-contacted graphene-metal contacts. We conclude that conducting\nall-carbon T-junctions should be feasible.\n", "  We study the dissipative Hofstadter model on a triangular lattice, making use\nof the $O(2,2;R)$ T-dual transformation of string theory. The $O(2,2;R)$ dual\ntransformation transcribes the model in a commutative basis into the model in a\nnon-commutative basis. In the zero temperature limit, the model exhibits an\nexact duality, which identifies equivalent points on the two dimensional\nparameter space of the model. The exact duality also defines magic circles on\nthe parameter space, where the model can be mapped onto the boundary\nsine-Gordon on a triangular lattice. The model describes the junction of three\nquantum wires in a uniform magnetic field background. An explicit expression of\nthe equivalence condition, which identifies the points on the two dimensional\nparameter space of the model by the exact duality, is obtained. It may help us\nto understand the structure of the phase diagram of the model.\n", "  We establish a generalization of Luttinger's theorem that applies to\nfractionalized Fermi liquids, i.e. Fermi liquids coexisting with symmetry\nenriched topological order. We find that, in the linear relation between the\nFermi volume and the density of fermions, the contribution of the density is\nchanged by the filling fraction associated with the topologically ordered\nsector, which is determined by how the symmetries fractionalize. Conversely,\nthis places constraints on the allowed symmetry enriched topological orders\nthat can manifest in a fractionalized Fermi liquid with a given Fermi volume\nand density of fermions.\n", "  The E and B Experiment (EBEX) is a balloon-borne polarimeter designed to\nmeasure the polarization of the cosmic microwave background radiation and to\ncharacterize the polarization of galactic dust. EBEX was launched December 29,\n2012 and circumnavigated Antarctica observing $\\sim$6,000 square degrees of sky\nduring 11 days at three frequency bands centered around 150, 250 and 410 GHz.\nEBEX was the first experiment to operate a kilo-pixel array of transition-edge\nsensor bolometers and a continuously rotating achromatic half-wave plate aboard\na balloon platform. It also pioneered the use of detector readout based on\ndigital frequency domain multiplexing.\n  We describe the temperature calibration of the experiment. The gain response\nof the experiment is calibrated using a two-step iterative process. We use\nsignals measured on passes across the Galactic plane to convert from\nreadout-system counts to power. The effective smoothing scale of the EBEX\noptics and the star camera-to-detector offset angles are determined through\n\\c{hi}2 minimization using the compact HII region RCW 38. This two-step process\nis initially performed with parameters measured before the EBEX 2013 flight and\nthen repeated until the calibration factor and parameters converge.\n", "  We present a novel implementation of the modal discontinuous Galerkin (DG)\nmethod for hyperbolic conservation laws in two dimensions on graphics\nprocessing units (GPUs) using NVIDIA's Compute Unified Device Architecture\n(CUDA). Both flexible and highly accurate, DG methods accommodate parallel\narchitectures well as their discontinuous nature produces element-local\napproximations. High performance scientific computing suits GPUs well, as these\npowerful, massively parallel, cost-effective devices have recently included\nsupport for double-precision floating point numbers. Computed examples for\nEuler equations over unstructured triangle meshes demonstrate the effectiveness\nof our implementation on an NVIDIA GTX 580 device. Profiling of our method\nreveals performance comparable to an existing nodal DG-GPU implementation for\nlinear problems.\n", "  In the Letter [J. Nucl. Mater. 444, 356 (2014)] and Comment [Phys Rev B 90,\n157101 (2014)], Soderlind et al. argue that 1) DFT based on GGA already models\nU metal and U-Zr alloy accurately, and 2) DFT + U models them worse than DFT\naccording to results they calculate or select from our recent study [Phys. Rev.\nB 88, 235128 (2013)]. Here we demonstrate in response to 1) that previously\nneglected and more recent experimental data indicate that DFT, even when\nimplemented in all-electron methods, does not model the bulk modulus and\nelastic constants of {\\alpha}U very accurately. Furthermore, Soderlind et al.'s\nclaim that deficiency exists in our PAW calculation is unfounded and hence our\nresults, including those that show DFT results compare unfavorably with\nexperimental/computational references, are valid. We also demonstrate in\nresponse to 2) that Soderlind et al.'s arguments are unsound for three reasons.\nFirst, they focus on just the BCC phases {\\gamma}U and {\\gamma}(U,Zr)--which at\nthe ab initio modeling temperature of 0 K are unstable and hence difficult to\nmodel and benchmar--as primary subjects of examination; however it is results\nfor the stable phases mostly neglected by Soderlind et al. that are the primary\nevidence of our argument. Second, they make unfounded generalization of DFT + U\nresults at selected U eff values to argue that DFT + U in general gives wrong\nor unsatisfactory results. Third, some key points in Soderlind et al.'s\ncriticisms of DFT + U are not well supported, including the claims that for\n{\\gamma}(U,Zr) DFT + U at Ueff = 1.24 eV gives positive deviations from linear\ndependence of composition that are unprecedentedly large and partially negative\nenthalpies of mixing that are inconsistent with the existence of miscibility\ngap in the experimental phase diagram. We therefore maintain our conclusion\nthat DFT + U can be of value for modeling U and U-Zr.\n", "  We consider an anisotropically two-dimensional diffusion of a charged\nmolecule (particle) through a large biological channel under an external\nvoltage. The channel is modeled as a cylinder of three structure parameters:\nradius, length, and surface density of negative charges located at the channel\ninterior-lining. These charges induce inside the channel a potential that plays\na key role in controlling the particle current through the channel. It was\nshown that to facilitate the transmembrane particle movement the channel should\nbe reasonably self-optimized so that its potential coincides with the resonant\none, resulting in a large particle current across the channel. Observed\nfacilitation appears to be an intrinsic property of biological channels,\nregardless the external voltage or the particle concentration gradient. This\nfacilitation is very selective in the sense that a channel of definite\nstructure parameters can facilitate the transmembrane movement of only\nparticles of proper valence at corresponding temperatures. Calculations also\nshow that the modeled channel is non-Ohmic with the ion conductance which\nexhibits a resonance at the same channel potential as that identified in the\ncurrent.\n", "  We fabricate LaxSr2-x-yBayIrO4-delta thin films by pulsed laser deposition,\nin an effort to realize the effective carrier doping and metallization in the\nSr2IrO4 system. We design ideal in-plane Ir-O-Ir frame structure by utilizing\ntensile substrate strain and Ba substitution, as well as control La doping and\noxygen deficiency. This enables us to elucidate relation between the charge\ntransport and the carrier density through systematic changes from original\np-type spin-orbit Mott insulator to highly doped n-type metal.\n", "  A parameter, called the degree of diffraction, is defined to describe the\ndiffractive spreading of a monochromatic light beam. The same as the degree of\nparaxiality that was introduced by Gawhary and Severini in Opt. Lett. 33, 1360\n(2008), the degree of diffraction depends only on beam's angular spectrum. With\nthis definition, it is possible to quantitatively compare the diffractive\nspreading of different light beams.\n", "  Adoption of innovations, products or online services is commonly interpreted\nas a spreading process driven to large extent by social influence and\nconditioned by the needs and capacities of individuals. To model this process\none usually introduces behavioural threshold mechanisms, which can give rise to\nthe evolution of global cascades if the system satisfies a set of conditions.\nHowever, these models do not address temporal aspects of the emerging cascades,\nwhich in real systems may evolve through various pathways ranging from slow to\nrapid patterns. Here we fill this gap through the analysis and modelling of\nproduct adoption in the world's largest voice over internet service, the social\nnetwork of Skype. We provide empirical evidence about the heterogeneous\ndistribution of fractional behavioural thresholds, which appears to be\nindependent of the degree of adopting egos. We show that the structure of\nreal-world adoption clusters is radically different from previous theoretical\nexpectations, since vulnerable adoptions --induced by a single adopting\nneighbour-- appear to be important only locally, while spontaneous adopters\narriving at a constant rate and the involvement of unconcerned individuals\ngovern the global emergence of social spreading.\n", "  Extensive line lists generated as part of the ExoMol project are used to\ncompute lifetimes for individual rotational, rovibrational and rovibronic\nexcited states, and temperature-dependent cooling functions by summing over all\ndipole-allowed transitions for the states concerned. Results are presented for\nSiO, CaH, AlO, ScH, H$_2$O and methane. The results for CH$_4$ are particularly\nunusual with 4 excited states with no dipole-allowed decay route and several\nothers where these decays lead to exceptionally long lifetimes. These lifetime\ndata should be useful in models of masers and estimates of critical densities,\nand can provide a link with laboratory measurements. Cooling functions are\nimportant in stellar and planet formation.\n", "  The effect of chemical doping on the ZSiNRs with Mn as passivating element\nreplacing H atoms at one edge are investigated by first principles\ncalculations.The structures optimized in the typical ferromagnetic and\nantiferromagnetic coupling show that the system leads to an AFM state and\nachieve half metallic properties.Also,our first principle approach based on the\nKeldysh nonequilibrium Greens function method gives the spin dependent\ntransport properties of the device. When the system changes from parallel to\nantiparallel configuration. the spin up current increases rapidly while the\nspin down current is still depressed. Further, it is found that the system is a\nquite good spin filtering device with nearly 80 percent spin filtering\nefficiency at a wide bias voltage region and therefore suitable for\napplications. The mechanisms for these phenomena are proposed in detail.\n", "  We discuss color screening in 2+1 flavor QCD in terms of free energies of a\nstatic quark-antiquark pair. Thermal modifications of long distance\ncorrelations in quark-antiquark systems are studied in terms of static meson\ncorrelators. We calculate the Polyakov loop correlator, the color-singlet\nWilson line correlator in Coulomb gauge and the cyclic Wilson loop on lattices\nusing the HISQ/Tree action and almost physical quark mases with $N_\\tau= 4, 6,\n8, 10, 12$. We present results in the continuum limit for temperatures up to $T\n\\lesssim 650$ MeV and discuss the linear divergence of the cyclic Wilson loop.\n", "  We present absolute-frequency measurements for the transitions from the\n6s$_{1/2}$ ground state of $^{133}$Cs to $n$p$_{1/2}$ and $n$p$_{3/2}$ Rydberg\nstates. The transition frequencies are determined by one-photon UV spectroscopy\nin ultracold samples of Cs atoms using a narrowband laser system referenced to\na frequency comb. From a global fit of the ionization energy $E_\\mathrm{I}$ and\nthe quantum defects of the two series we determine an improved value of\n$E_\\mathrm{I} = h c \\cdot 31 406.467 732 5(14)$ cm$^{-1}$ for the ionization\nenergy of Cs with a relative uncertainty of $5\\times10^{-11}$. We also report\nimproved values for the quantum defects of the $n$p$_{1/2}$, $n$p$_{3/2}$,\n$n$s$_{1/2}$, and $n$d$_{5/2}$ series.\n", "  The temporal Fokker-Plank equation [{\\it J. Stat. Phys.}, {\\bf 3/4}, 527\n(2003)] or propagation-dispersion equation was derived to describe diffusive\nprocesses with temporal dispersion rather than spatial dispersion as in\nclassical diffusion. %\\cite{boon-grosfils-lutsko}. We present two\ngeneralizations of the temporal Fokker-Plank equation for the first passage\ndistribution function $f_j(r,t)$ of a particle moving on a substrate with time\ndelays $\\tau_j$. Both generalizations follow from the first visit master\nequation. In the first case, the time delays depend on the local concentration,\nthat is the time delay probability $P_j$ is a functional of the particle\ndistribution function and we show that when the functional dependence is of the\npower law type, $P_j \\propto f_j^{\\nu - 1}$, the generalized Fokker-Plank\nequation exhibits a structure similar to that of the nonlinear spatial\ndiffusion equation where the roles of space and time are reversed. In the\nsecond case, we consider the situation where the time delays are distributed\naccording to a power law, $P_j \\propto \\tau_j^{-1-\\alpha}$ (with $0 < \\alpha <\n2$), in which case we obtain a fractional propagation-dispersion equation which\nis the temporal analog of the fractional spatial diffusion equation (with space\nand time interchanged).\n", "  Associated Legendre functions of the first kind give a family of BCOV rings\non elliptic curves. We prove that the family is parametrized by $q$-exponents\nof the eta function $\\eta(q^{24})$. Our method involves a classification of\nrational solutions of a Riccati equation under some constraints.\n", "  We apply a subtracted dispersion relation (DR) formalism with the aim to\nimprove predictions for the two-photon exchange (TPE) corrections to elastic\nelectron-proton scattering observables at small momentum transfers. We study\nthe formalism on the elastic TPE contribution in comparison with existing data\nfor unpolarized cross sections. We extend the general formalism of TPE to\nelastic scattering with massive lepton and perform a numerical estimate of the\nmuon-proton scattering at low momentum transfer in view of the upcoming\nmuon-proton scattering experiment (MUSE). We study the influence of the\ndouble-virtual Compton scattering (VVCS) subtraction function on the\nunpolarized lepton-proton scattering cross-section. We show that the resulting\nTPE correction is negligible in the electron-proton scattering and smaller than\nplanned uncertainties of the MUSE experiment for the subtraction functions\nevaluated in chiral perturbation theory.\n", "  We investigate a topological insulator -- superconductor heterostructure with\nan Abrikosov vortex in a magnetic field. Large Zeeman field causes a\ntopological phase transition in the system. We found that a Majorana fermion\nexists at the vortex core in the phase with zero first Chern number and does\nnot exist at the phase with non-trivial first Chern number. This result is\nsupported by the index theorem. This system provides an example in which a\nMajorana fermion emerges in a system with zero first Chern number.\n", "  A full spectral characterization of carbonaceous dust analogs is necessary to\nunderstand their potential as carriers of observed astronomical spectral\nsignatures such as the ubiquitous UV bump at 217.5 nm and the far-ultraviolet\n(FUV) rise common to interstellar extinction curves. Our goal is to study the\nspectral properties of carbonaceous dust analogs from the FUV to the\nmid-infrared (MIR) domain. We seek in particular to understand the spectra of\nthese materials in the FUV range, for which laboratory studies are scarce. We\nproduced analogs to carbonaceous interstellar dust encountered in various\nphases of the interstellar medium: amorphous hydrogenated carbons (a-C:H), for\ncarbonaceous dust observed in the diffuse interstellar medium, and soot\nparticles, for the polyaromatic component. Analogs to a-C:H dust were produced\nusing a radio-frequency plasma reactor at low pressures, and soot nanoparticles\nfilms were produced in an ethylene (C$_2$H$_4$) flame. We measured transmission\nspectra of these thin films (thickness < 100 nm) in the far-ultraviolet (190 -\n250 nm) and in the vacuum-ultraviolet (VUV; 50 - 190 nm) regions using the APEX\nchamber at the DISCO beam line of the SOLEIL synchrotron radiation facility.\nThese were also characterized through infrared microscopy at the SMIS beam\nline. We successfully measured the transmission spectra of these analogs from\n{\\lambda} = 1 {\\mu}m to 50 nm. From these, we extracted the laboratory optical\nconstants via Kramers-Kronig inversion. We used these constants for comparison\nto existing interstellar extinction curves. We extend the spectral measurements\nof these types of carbonaceous analogs into the VUV and link the spectral\nfeatures in this range to the 3.4 {\\mu}m band. We suggest that these two\nmaterials might contribute to different classes of interstellar extinction\ncurves.\n", "  In this paper, we rigorously derive a new compressible multifluid system from\ncompressible Navier-Stokes equations with density-dependent viscosity in the\none-dimensional in space setting. More precisely, we propose and mathematically\nderive a generalization of the usual one velocity Baer-Nunziato model with a\nnew relaxation term in the PDE governing the volume fractions. This new\nrelaxation term encodes the change of viscosity and pressure between the\ndifferent fluids. For the reader's convenience, we first establish a formal\nderivation in the bifluid setting using a WKB decomposition and then we\nrigorously justify the multifluid homogenized system using a kinetic\nformulation via Young measures characterization.\n", "  We present a novel floating catalyst synthesis route for individual, i.e.\nnon-bundled, small diameter single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) with a\nnarrow chiral angle distribution peaking at high chiralities near the armchair\nspecies. An ex situ spark discharge generator was used to form iron particles\nwith geometric number mean diameters of 3-4 nm and fed into a laminar flow\nchemical vapour deposition reactor for the continuous synthesis of long and\nhigh-quality SWCNTs from ambient pressure carbon monoxide. The intensity ratio\nof G/D peaks in Raman spectra up to 48 and mean tube lengths up to 4 microns\nwere observed. The chiral distributions, as directly determined by electron\ndiffraction in the transmission electron microscope, clustered around the (n,m)\nindices (7,6), (8,6), (8,7) and (9,6), with up to 70% of tubes having chiral\nangles over 20{\\deg}. The mean diameter of SWCNTs was reduced from 1.10 to 1.04\nnm by decreasing the growth temperature from 880 to 750 {\\deg}C, which\nsimultaneously increased the fraction of semiconducting tubes from 67 to 80%.\nLimiting the nanotube gas phase number concentration to approx. 100 000 per\ncubic centimetre successfully prevented nanotube bundle formation that is due\nto collisions induced by Brownian diffusion. Up to 80 % of 500 as-deposited\ntubes observed by atomic force and transmission electron microscopy were\nindividual. Transparent conducting films deposited from these SWCNTs exhibited\nrecord low sheet resistances of 63 Ohms/sq. at 90 % transparency for 550 nm\nlight.\n", "  Pan, Vekilov and Lubchenko[\\textit{J. Phys. Chem. B}, 2010, \\textbf{114},\n7620] have proposed that dense stable protein clusters appearing in weak\nprotein solutions above the solubility curve are composed of protein oligomers.\nThe hypothesis is that a weak solution of oligomer species is unstable with\nrespect to condensation causing the formation of dense, oligomer-rich droplets\nwhich are stabilized against growth by the monomer-oligomer reaction. Here, we\nshow that such a combination of processes can be understood using a simple\ncapillary model yielding analytic expressions for the cluster properties which\ncan be used to interpret experimental data. We also construct a microscopic\nDynamic Density Functional Theory model and show that it is consistent with the\npredictions of the capillary model. The viability of the mechanism is thus\nconfirmed and it is shown how the radius of the stable clusters is related to\nphysically interesting quantities such as the monomer-oligomer rate constants.\n", "  The ultimate performance - ratio of electrical conductivity to optical\nabsorbance - of single- walled carbon nanotube (SWCNTs) transparent conductive\nfilms (TCFs) is an issue of considerable application relevance. Here, we\npresent direct experimental evidence that SWCNT bundling is detrimental for\ntheir performance. We combine floating catalyst synthesis of non-bundled,\nhigh-quality SWCNTs with an aggregation chamber, in which bundles with mean\ndiameters ranging from 1.38 to 2.90 nm are formed from identical 3 microns long\nSWCNTs. The as-deposited TCFs from 1.38 nm bundles showed sheet resistances of\n310 Ohms/sq. at 90% transparency, while those from larger bundles of 1.80 and\n2.90 nm only reached values of 475 and 670 Ohms/sq., respectively. Based on\nthese observations, we elucidate how networks formed by smaller bundles perform\nbetter due to their greater interconnectivity at a given optical density.\nFinally, we present a semi-empirical model for TCF performance as a function of\nSWCNT mean length and bundle diameter. This gives an estimate for the ultimate\nperformance of non-doped, random network mixed-metallicity SWCNT TCFs at ~80\nOhms/sq. and 90% transparency.\n", "  Extracting the optimal amount of power from an array of tidal turbines\nrequires an intricate understanding of tidal dynamics and the effects of\nturbine placement on the local and regional scale flow. Numerical models have\ncontributed significantly towards this understanding, and more recently,\nadjoint-based modelling has been employed to optimise the positioning of the\nturbines in an array in an automated way and improve on simple, regular\nman-made configurations. Adjoint-based optimisation of high-resolution and\nideally 3D transient models is generally a very computationally expensive\nproblem. As a result, existing work on the adjoint optimisation of tidal\nturbine placement has been mostly limited to steady-state simulations in which\nvery high, non-physical values of the background viscosity are required to\nensure that a steady-state solution exists. However, such compromises may\naffect the reliability of the modelled turbines, their wakes and interactions,\nand thus bring into question the validity of the computed optimal turbine\npositions. This work considers a suite of idealised simulations of flow past\ntidal turbine arrays in a 2D channel. It compares four regular array\nconfigurations, detailed by Divett et al. (2013), with the configuration found\nthrough adjoint optimisation in a steady-state, high-viscosity setup. The\noptimised configuration produces considerably more power. The same\nconfigurations are then used to produce a suite of transient simulations that\ndo not use constant high-viscosity, and instead use large eddy simulation (LES)\nto parameterise the resulting turbulent structures. It is shown that the LES\nsimulations produce less power than that predicted by the constant\nhigh-viscosity runs. Nevertheless, they still follow the same trends in the\npower curve throughout time, with optimised layouts continuing to perform\nsignificantly better than simplified configurations.\n", "  A new approximation to the Stokes drift velocity profile based on the exact\nsolution for the Phillips spectrum is explored. The profile is compared with\nthe monochromatic profile and the recently proposed exponential integral\nprofile. ERA-Interim spectra and spectra from a wave buoy in the central North\nSea are used to investigate the behaviour of the profile. It is found that the\nnew profile has a much stronger gradient near the surface and lower normalized\ndeviation from the profile computed from the spectra. Based on estimates from\ntwo open-ocean locations, an average value has been estimated for a key\nparameter of the profile. Given this parameter, the profile can be computed\nfrom the same two parameters as the monochromatic profile, namely the transport\nand the surface Stokes drift velocity.\n", "  The Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) is a great source of\ntop-quality photometry of classical pulsators. Collection of variable stars\nfrom the fourth part of the project contains more than 38 000 RR Lyrae stars.\nThese stars pulsate mostly in the radial fundamental mode (RRab), in radial\nfirst overtone (RRc) or in both modes simultaneously (RRd). Analysis of the\nOGLE data allowed to detect additional non-radial modes in RRc and in RRd\nstars. We have found more than 260 double-mode stars with characteristic period\nratio of the additional (shorter) period to first overtone period around 0.61,\nincreasing the number of known stars of this type by factor of 10. Stars from\nthe OGLE sample form three nearly parallel sequences in the Petersen diagram.\nSome stars show more than one non-radial mode simultaneously. These modes\nbelong to different sequences.\n", "  Xinglong Observatory of the National Astronomical Observatories, Chinese\nAcademy of Sciences (NAOC), is one of the major optical observatories in China,\nwhich hosts nine optical telescopes including the Large Sky Area Multi-Object\nFiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) and the 2.16 m reflector. Scientific\nresearch from these telescopes is focused on stars, galaxies, and exoplanets\nusing multicolor photometry and spectroscopic observations. Therefore, it is\nimportant to provide the observing conditions of the site, in detail, to the\nastronomers for an efficient use of these facilities. In this article, we\npresent the characterization of observing conditions at Xinglong Observatory\nbased on the monitoring of meteorology, seeing and sky brightness during the\nperiod from 2007 to 2014. Results suggest that Xinglong Observatory is still a\ngood site for astronomical observations. Our analysis of the observing\nconditions at Xinglong Observatory can be used as a reference to the observers\non targets selection, observing strategy, and telescope operation.\n", "  Consider a particle sitting at a fixed position outside of a stable black\nhole. If the system is heated up, the black hole horizon grows and there should\nexist a critical temperature above which the particle enters the black hole\ninterior. We solve a simple model describing exactly this situation: a large N\nmatrix quantum mechanics modeling a fixed D-particle in a black hole\nbackground. We show that indeed a striking phenomenon occurs: above some\ncritical temperature, there is a non-perturbative Bose-Einstein condensation of\nmassless strings. The transition, even though precisely defined by the presence\nof the condensate, cannot be sharply detected by measurements made in a finite\namount of time. The order parameter is fundamentally non-local in time and\ncorresponds to infinite-time correlations.\n", "  We present the valence electron energy-loss spectrum and the dielectric\nfunction of monoclinic hafnia (m-HfO$_2$) obtained from time-dependent\ndensity-functional theory (TDDFT) predictions and compared to energy-filtered\nspectroscopic imaging measurements in a high-resolution transmission-electron\nmicroscope. Fermi's Golden Rule density-functional theory (DFT) calculations\ncan capture the qualitative features of the energy-loss spectrum, but we find\nthat TDDFT, which accounts for local-field effects, provides nearly\nquantitative agreement with experiment. Using the DFT density of states and\nTDDFT dielectric functions, we characterize the excitations that result in the\nm-HfO$_2$ energy loss spectrum. The sole plasmon occurs between 13-16 eV,\nalthough the peaks $\\sim$28 and above 40 eV are also due to collective\nexcitations. We furthermore elaborate on the first-principles techniques used,\ntheir accuracy, and remaining discrepancies among spectra. More specifically,\nwe assess the influence of Hf semicore electrons (5$p$ and 4$f$) on the\nenergy-loss spectrum, and find that the inclusion of transitions from the 4$f$\nband damps the energy-loss intensity in the region above 13 eV. We study the\nimpact of many-body effects in a DFT framework using the adiabatic\nlocal-density approximation (ALDA) exchange-correlation kernel, as well as from\na many-body perspective using a $GW$-derived electronic structure to account\nfor self-energy corrections. These results demonstrate some cancellation of\nerrors between self-energy and excitonic effects, even for excitations from the\nHf $4f$ shell. We also simulate the dispersion with increasing momentum\ntransfer for plasmon and collective excitation peaks.\n", "  In this note we discuss the quantum mechanical three-body problem with\npairwise zero-range interactions in dimension three. We review the state of the\nart concerning the construction of the corresponding Hamiltonian as a\nself-adjoint operator in the bosonic and in the fermionic case. Exploiting a\nquadratic form method, we also prove self-adjointness and boundedness from\nbelow in the case of three identical bosons when the Hilbert space is suitably\nrestricted, i.e., excluding the \"s-wave\" subspace.\n", "  IGR~J19149+1036 is a high mass X-ray binary detected by INTEGRAL in 2011 in\nthe hard X-ray domain. We have analyzed the BAT survey data of the first 103\nmonths of the Swift mission detecting this source at a significance level of\n~30 standard deviations. The timing analysis on the long term BAT light curve\nreveals the presence of a strong sinusoidal intensity modulation of 22.25+/-\n0.05 d, that we interpret as the orbital period of this binary system.\n  A broad band (0.3-150 keV) spectral analysis was performed combining the BAT\nspectrum and the XRT spectra from the pointed follow up observations. The\nspectrum is adequately modeled with an absorbed power law with a high energy\ncutoff at ~24 keV and an absorption cyclotron feature at ~31 keV. Correcting\nfor the gravitational redshift, the inferred magnetic field at the neutron star\nsurface is B_surf ~ 3.6 x 10^12 gauss.\n", "  Wavefront shaping has revolutionized the concepts of optical imaging and\nfocusing. Contrary to what was believed, strong scattering in the optical paths\ncan be exploited in favor of light focusing through turbid media and ultimately\nimprove optical imaging and light manipulation capabilities. The use of light\nshapers and appropriately engineered scattering structures, i.e. opaque lenses\nenables the production of nano-scale confined foci and of extended fields of\nview. Exploiting this concept we fabricate configurable scattering structures\nby direct femtosecond laser writing. The properly shaped light trespassing the\ncustomized structure, a photonic lattice of parallel rods, forms a light-sheet\nat user defined positions. We demonstrate that our technique enables\nlight-sheets with sub-micron resolution and extended depth of focus, a\nsignificant advantage when compared to the existing free space systems.\nMoreover, our approach permits to focus light of different wavelengths onto the\nsame defined position without moving any optical element and correcting for\nchromatic aberrations. Furthermore, we demonstrate how an opaque cylindrical\nlens can be created using a biological structure, hence unveiling the potential\nadvantages for optical microscopic and mesoscopic imaging.\n", "  Finsleroid-Finsler metrics form an important class of singular (y-local)\nFinsler metrics. They were introduced by G. S. Asanov [2] in 2006. As the\nspecial case of the general construction Asanov produced singular (y - local)\nexamples of Landsberg spaces of dimension at least three that are not of\nBerwald type. The existence of regular (y - global) Landsberg metrics that are\nnot of Berwald type is an open problem up to this day; for a detailed\nexposition of the so-called unicorn problem in Finsler geometry see D. Bao [3].\n  In this paper we are going to characterize the Finsleroid-Finsler metrics as\nthe solutions of a conformal rigidity problem. We are looking for\n(non-Riemannian) Finsler metrics admitting a (non-homothetic) conformal change\nsuch that the mixed curvature tensor of the Berwald connection contracted by\nthe derivatives of the logarithmic scale function is invariant. We prove that\nthe solutions of class at least $\\mathcal{C}^2$ on the complement of the zero\nsection are conformal to Finsleroid-Finsler metrics.\n", "  We report the experimental observation of quantized conductance by Rashba\nbands at the surface of 50-nm Bi nanowires. With increasing magnetic fields\nalong the wire axis, the wires exhibit a stepwise increase of conductance with\nas many as four distinct plateaus together with oscillatory thermopower. The\nobservations can be accounted for by the increase of the number of propagating\nsurface modes. The modes have very high mobility and are associated with\nAharonov-Bohm interference around the perimeter consistently with theory of\nquasiballistic one-dimensional nanowires considering that Lorentz forces\ndecouple the modes from scattering at the nanowire surface.\n", "  Top quark pair production in association with a $Z$-boson or a photon at the\nLHC directly probes neutral top-quark couplings. We present predictions for\nthese two processes in the Standard Model (SM) Effective Field Theory (EFT) at\nnext-to-leading (NLO) order in QCD. We include the full set of CP-even\ndimension-six operators that enter the top-quark interactions with the SM gauge\nbosons. For comparison, we also present predictions in the SMEFT for top\nloop-induced $HZ$ production at the LHC and for $t\\bar{t}$ production at the\nILC at NLO in QCD. Results for total cross sections and differential\ndistributions are obtained and uncertainties coming from missing higher orders\nin the strong coupling and in the EFT expansions are discussed. NLO results\nmatched to the parton shower are available, allowing for event generation to be\ndirectly employed in an experimental analyses. Our framework provides a solid\nbasis for the interpretation of current and future measurements in the SMEFT,\nwith improved accuracy and precision.\n", "  Iron-based superconductors have been found to exhibit an intimate interplay\nof orbital, spin, and lattice degrees of freedom, dramatically affecting their\nlow-energy electronic properties, including superconductivity. Albeit the\nprecise pairing mechanism remains unidentified, several candidate interactions\nhave been suggested to mediate the superconducting pairing, both in the orbital\nand in the spin channel. Here, we employ optical spectroscopy (OS),\nangle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), ab initio band-structure,\nand Eliashberg calculations to show that nearly optimally doped\nNaFe$_{0.978}$Co$_{0.022}$As exhibits some of the strongest orbitally selective\nelectronic correlations in the family of iron pnictides. Unexpectedly, we find\nthat the mass enhancement of itinerant charge carriers in the strongly\ncorrelated band is dramatically reduced near the $\\Gamma$ point and attribute\nthis effect to orbital mixing induced by pronounced spin-orbit coupling.\nEmbracing the true band structure allows us to describe all low-energy\nelectronic properties obtained in our experiments with remarkable consistency\nand demonstrate that superconductivity in this material is rather weak and\nmediated by spin fluctuations.\n", "  We show that probabilities of results of all possible measurements performing\non a quantum system depend on the system's state only through its density\nmatrix. Therefore all experimentally available information about the state\ncontains in the density matrix. In this study, we do not postulate that\nmeasurements obey some given formalism (such as observables, positive-operator\nvalued measures, etc.), and do not use Born rule. The process of measurement is\nconsidered in a fully operational manner---as an interaction of a measured\nsystem with some black-box apparatus. The key point of our approach is the\nproof that, for improper mixtures, the expected value of any measurement\ndepends linearly on the reduced density function. Such a proof is achieved by\nconsidering appropriate thought experiments. We demonstrate that Born rule can\nbe derived as a natural consequence of our results.\n", "  Grading shapes students' learning, and above all, students' approaches to\nproblem solving. In particular, grading can encourage expert-like\nproblem-solving. Teaching assistants (TAs) are often responsible for grading\nstudent solutions, thus, their perceptions of grading are central in\ndetermining grading practices in the physics classroom. Studying TAs'\nperceptions of grading is instrumental for curriculum developers as well as\nprofessional development leaders interested in improving grading practices. In\norder to identify TAs' perceptions of grading, we used a data collection tool\ndesigned to bring to light TAs' considerations when making grading decisions as\nwell as possible conflicts between their stated goals and actual grading\npractices. In particular, the tool was devised to explicate TAs' attitudes\ntowards research-based grading practices intended to promote expert-like\nproblem solving approaches. TAs were first asked to state their goals for\ngrading in general. Then, TAs graded student solutions in a simulated setting\nwhile explicating and discussing underlying considerations. The data collection\ntool was administered before TAs entered their teaching appointment and after\none semester of teaching experience. We found that almost all of the TAs stated\nthat the purpose of grading was formative, i.e., grading should encourage\nstudents to learn from their mistakes as well as inform the instructor of\ncommon student difficulties. However, when making grading decisions in a\nsimulated setting, the majority of TAs' grading considerations focused on\ncorrectness and did not encourage expert-like approaches. TAs' perceptions of\ngrading did not change significantly during one semester of teaching\nexperience.\n", "  Magnetic chiral skyrmions are vortex like spin structures that appear as\nstable or meta-stable states in magnetic materials due to the interplay between\nthe symmetric and antisymmetric exchange interactions, applied magnetic field\nand/or uniaxial anisotropy. Their small size and internal stability make them\nprospective objects for data storage but for this, the controlled switching\nbetween skyrmion states of opposite polarity and topological charge is\nessential. Here we present a study of magnetic skyrmion switching by an applied\nmagnetic field pulse based on a discrete model of classical spins and atomistic\nspin dynamics. We found a finite range of coupling parameters corresponding to\nthe coexistence of two degenerate isolated skyrmions characterized by mutually\ninverted spin structures with opposite polarity and topological charge. We\ndemonstrate how for a wide range of material parameters a short inclined\nmagnetic field pulse can initiate the reliable switching between these states\nat GHz rates. Detailed analysis of the switching mechanism revealed the complex\npath of the system accompanied with the excitation of a chiral-achiral meron\npair and the formation of an achiral skyrmion.\n", "  Extending tensor models at the field theoretical level, tensor field theories\nare nonlocal quantum field theories with Feynman graphs identified with\nsimplicial complexes. They become relevant for addressing quantum topology and\ngeometry in any dimension and therefore form an interesting class of models for\nstudying quantum gravity. We review the class of perturbatively renormalizable\ntensor field theories and some of their features.\n", "  In this thesis a systematic comparison of supersymmetric plasma systems and\ntheir nonsupersymmetric counterparts is presented. The work is motivated by the\nAdS/CFT correspondence and the main aim is to check how much the plasma\ngoverned by the N=4 super Yang-Mills theory resembles the quark-gluon plasma\nstudied experimentally in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. The analysis is\ndone in a weak coupling regime where perturbative methods are applicable. Since\nthe Keldysh-Schwinger approach is used, not only equilibrium but also\nnonequilibrium plasmas, which are assumed to be ultrarelativistic, are under\nconsideration. First, using the functional techniques we introduce\nFaddeev-Popov ghosts into the Keldysh-Schwinger formalism of nonAbelian gauge\ntheories. Next the collective excitations of the N=1 SUSY QED plasma are\nconsidered and compared to those of the usual QED system. The analysis is\nrepeated to confront with each other the plasmas governed by the N=4 super\nYang-Mills and QCD theories. Finally, transport properties of the systems are\nalso discussed. Since both collective excitations and transport characteristics\nof supersymmetric and nonsupersymmetric plasmas are very similar to each other\nwe conclude that supersymmetric plasma systems are qualitatively the same as\ntheir nonsupersymmetric partners in weak coupling regime. The quantitative\ndifferences mostly reflect different numbers of degrees of freedom.\n", "  We give a brief review on the development of phenomenological NN interactions\nand the corresponding quantification of statistical uncertainties. We look into\nthe uncertainty of effective interactions broadly used in mean field\ncalculations through the Skyrme parameters and effective field theory\ncounter-terms by estimating both statistical and systematic uncertainties\nstemming from the NN interaction. We also comment on the role played by\ndifferent fitting strategies on the light of recent developments.\n", "  A simplified formalism of first quantized massless fields of any spin is\npresented. The angular momentum basis for particles of zero mass and finite\nspin s of the D^(s-1/2,1/2) representation of the Lorentz group is used to\ndescribe the wavefunctions. The advantage of the formalism is that by equating\nto zero the s-1 components of the wave functions, the 2s-1 subsidiary\nconditions (needed to eliminate the non-forward and non-backward helicities)\nare automatically satisfied. Probability currents and Lagrangians are derived\nallowing a first quantized formalism. A simple procedure is derived for\nconnecting the wave functions with potentials and gauge conditions. The spin 1\ncase is of particular interest and is described with the D^(1/2,1/2) vector\nrepresentation of the well known self-dual representation of the Maxwell's\nequations. This representation allows us to generalize Maxwell's equations by\nadding the E_0 and B_0 components to the electric and magnetic four-vectors.\nRestrictions on their existence are discussed.\n", "  We report that 1T-TiSe2, an archetypical layered transition metal\ndichalcogenide, becomes superconducting when Ta is substituted for Ti but not\nwhen Nb is substituted for Ti. This is unexpected because Nb and Ta should be\nchemically equivalent electron donors. Superconductivity emerges near x = 0.02\nfor Ti1-xTaxSe2, while for Ti1-xNbxSe2, no superconducting transitions are\nobserved above 0.4 K. The equivalent chemical nature of the dopants is\nconfirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. ARPES and Raman scattering\nstudies show similarities and differences between the two systems, but the\nfundamental reasons why the Nb and Ta dopants yield such different behavior are\nunknown. We present a comparison of the electronic phase diagrams of many\nelectron-doped 1T-TiSe2 systems, showing that they behave quite differently,\nwhich may have broad implications in the search for new superconductors. We\npropose that superconducting Ti0.8Ta0.2Se2 will be suitable for devices and\nother studies based on exfoliated crystal flakes.\n", "  This is a brief summary of the most important hairy black hole solutions in\n3+1 spacetime dimensions discovered over the last 25 years. These were first of\nall the Einstein-Yang-Mills black holes and their various generalizations\nincluding the Higgs field, the dilaton and the curvature corrections, and also\nthe Skyrme black holes. More recently, these were black holes supporting a\nscalar field violating the energy conditions or non-minimally coupled to\ngravity, and also spinning black holes with massive complex scalar hair.\nFinally, these were black holes with massive graviton hair.\n", "  Despite two decades of studies, the formation of metallic glasses, very\npromising systems for industrial applications, still remains mostly\nunexplained. This lack of knowledge hinders the search for new systems, still\nperformed with combinatorial trial and error. In the past, it was speculated\nthat some sort of \"confusion\" during crystallization could play a key role\nduring their formation. In this article, we propose a heuristic descriptor\nquantifying such confusion. It is based on the \"thermodynamic density of\ncompeting crystalline states\", parameterized from high-throughput ab-initio\ncalculations. The existence of highly enthalpy-degenerate but\ngeometrically-different phases frustrates the crystallization process and\npromotes glass formation. Two test beds are considered. A good and a bad\nglass-former, CuZr and NiZr, are experimentally characterized with\nhigh-throughput synthesis. The experimental results corroborate the capability\nof the heuristic descriptor in predicting glass forming ability through the\ncompositional space. Our analysis is expected to deepen the understanding of\nthe underlying mechanisms and to accelerate the discovery of novel metallic\nglasses.\n", "  It is well-known that a stable algebraic spin liquid state (or equivalently\nan algebraic Bose liquid (ABL) state) with emergent gapless photon excitations\ncan exist in quantum spin ice systems, or in a quantum dimer model on a\nbipartite $3d$ lattice. This photon phase is stable against any weak\nperturbation without assuming any symmetry. Further works concluded that\ncertain lattice models give rise to more exotic stable algebraic Bose liquid\nphases with graviton-like excitations. In this paper we will show how these\nalgebraic Bose liquid states can be generalized to stable phases with even more\nexotic types of gapless excitations and then argue that these new phases are\nstable against weak perturbations. We also explicitly show that these theories\nhave an (algebraic) topological ground state degeneracy on a torus, and\nconstruct the corresponding topological invariants.\n", "  The discovery of unusual heat conduction properties of graphene has led to a\nsurge of theoretical and experimental studies of phonon transport in\ntwo-dimensional material systems. The rapidly developing graphene thermal field\nspans from theoretical physics to practical engineering applications. In this\ninvited review we outline different theoretical approaches developed for\ndescribing phonon transport in graphene and provide comparison with available\nexperimental thermal conductivity data. A special attention is given to\nanalysis of the recent theoretical results for the phonon thermal conductivity\nof graphene and few-layer graphene, the effects of the strain, defects,\nisotopes and edge scattering on the acoustic phonon transport in these material\nsystems.\n", "  We study the photoabsorption properties of photoactive bulk polymer/\nfullerene/nanotube heterojunctions in the near-infrared region. By combining\npump-probe spectroscopy and linear response time-dependent density functional\ntheory within the random phase approximation (TDDFT-RPA) we elucidate the\nexcited state dynamics of the $E_{11}$ transition within (6,5) and (7,5)\nsingle-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) and combined with\npoly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT) and [6,6]-phenyl-C$_{61}$-butyric acid\nmethyl ester (PCBM) in P3HT/PCBM/SWNT blended samples. We find the presence of\na photoinduced absorption (PA) peak is related mainly to the width of the\nphotobleach (PB) peak and the charge carrier density of the SWNT system. For\nmixed SWNT samples, the PB peak is too broad to observe the PA peak, whereas\nwithin P3HT/PCBM/SWNT blended samples P3HT acts as a hole acceptor, narrowing\nthe PB peak by exciton delocalization, which reveals a PA peak. Our results\nsuggest that the PA peak originates from a widening of the band gap in the\npresence of excited electrons and holes. These results have important\nimplications for the development of new organic photovoltaic heterojunctions\nincluding SWNTs.\n", "  Pristine monocrystalline graphene is claimed to be the strongest material\nknown with remarkable mechanical and electrical properties. However, graphene\nmade with scalable fabrication techniques is polycrystalline and contains\ninherent nano-scale line and point defects - grain boundaries and\ngrain-boundary triple junctions - that lead to significant statistical\nfluctuations in toughness and strength. These fluctuations become particularly\npronounced for nanocrystalline graphene where the density of defects is high.\nHere we use large-scale simulation and continuum modeling to show that the\nstatistical variation in toughness and strength can be understood with\n'weakest-link' statistics. We develop the first statistical theory of toughness\nin polycrystalline graphene, and elucidate the nano-scale origins of the\ngrain-size dependence of its strength and toughness. Our results should lead to\nmore reliable graphene device design, and provide a framework to interpret\nexperimental results in a broad class of 2D materials.\n", "  We introduce an efficient method to construct optimal and system adaptive\nbasis sets for use in electronic structure and quantum Monte Carlo\ncalculations. The method is based on an embedding scheme in which a reference\natom is singled out from its environment, while the entire system (atom and\nenvironment) is described by a Slater determinant or its antisymmetrized\ngeminal power (AGP) extension. The embedding procedure described here allows\nfor the systematic and consistent contraction of the primitive basis set into\ngeminal embedded orbitals (GEOs), with a dramatic reduction of the number of\nvariational parameters necessary to represent the many-body wave function, for\na chosen target accuracy. Within the variational Monte Carlo method, the Slater\nor AGP part is determined by a variational minimization of the energy of the\nwhole system in presence of a flexible and accurate Jastrow factor,\nrepresenting most of the dynamical electronic correlation. The resulting GEO\nbasis set opens the way for a fully controlled optimization of many-body wave\nfunctions in electronic structure calculation of bulk materials, namely,\ncontaining a large number of electrons and atoms. We present applications on\nthe water molecule, the volume collapse transition in cerium, and the\nhigh-pressure liquid hydrogen.\n", "  Four decades after its prediction, the axion remains the most compelling\nsolution to the Strong-CP problem and a well-motivated dark matter candidate,\ninspiring a host of elegant and ultrasensitive experiments based on\naxion-photon mixing. This report reviews the experimental situation on several\nfronts. The microwave cavity experiment is making excellent progress in the\nsearch for dark matter axions in the microelectronvolt range and may be\nplausibly extended up to 100 mu eV. Within the past several years however, it\nhas been realized that axions are pervasive throughout string theories, but\nwith masses that fall naturally in the nanoelectronvolt range, for which a\nNMR-based search is under development. Searches for axions emitted from the\nSun's burning core, and purely laboratory experiments based on photon\nregeneration have both made great strides in recent years, with ambitious\nprojects proposed for the coming decade. Each of these campaigns has pushed the\nstate of the art in technology, enabling large gains in sensitivity and mass\nreach. Furthermore each modality has also been exploited to search for more\ngeneralized axion-like particles, that will also be discussed in this report.\nWe are hopeful, even optimistic, that the next review of the subject will\nconcern the discovery of the axion, its properties, and its exploitation as a\nprobe of early universe cosmology and structure formation.\n", "  Modified dark matter (MDM, formerly known as MoNDian dark matter) is a\nphenomenological model of dark matter, inspired by quantum gravity. We review\nthe construction of MDM by generalizing entropic gravity to de-Sitter space as\nis appropriate for an accelerating universe (in accordance with the Lambda-CDM\nmodel). Unlike cold dark matter models, the MDM mass profile depends on the\nbaryonic mass. We successfully fit the rotation curves to a sample of 30 local\nspiral galaxies with a single free parameter (viz., the mass-to-light ratio for\neach galaxy). We show that dynamical and observed masses agree in a sample of\n93 galactic clusters. We also comment on strong gravitational lensing in the\ncontext of MDM.\n", "  The study of open quantum systems is important for fundamental issues of\nquantum physics as well as for technological applications such as quantum\ninformation processing. The interaction of a quantum system with it's\nenvironment is usually detrimental for the quantum properties of the system and\nleads to decoherence. However, sometimes a coherent partial exchange of\ninformation takes place between the system and the environment and the dynamics\nof the open system becomes non-Markovian. In this article we study discrete\nopen quantum system dynamics where single evolution step consist of local\nunitary transformation on the open system followed by a coupling unitary\nbetween the system and the environment. We implement experimentally a local\ncontrol protocol for controlling the transition from Markovian to non-Markovian\ndynamics.\n", "  The single excitation subspace (SES) method for universal quantum simulation\nis investigated for a number of diatomic molecular collision complexes.\nAssuming a system of $n$ tunably-coupled, and fully-connected superconducting\nqubits, computations are performed in the $n$-dimensional SES which maps\ndirectly to an $n$-channel collision problem within a diabatic molecular wave\nfunction representation. Here we outline the approach on a classical computer\nto solve the time-dependent Schr\\\"odinger equation in an $n$-dimensional\nmolecular basis - the so-called semiclassical molecular-orbital close-coupling\n(SCMOCC) method - and extend the treatment beyond the straight-line,\nconstant-velocity approximation which is restricted to large kinetic energies\n($\\gtrsim 0.1$ keV/u). We explore various multichannel potential averaging\nschemes and an Ehrenfest symmetrization approach to allow for the application\nof the SCMOCC method to much lower collision energies (approaching 1 eV/u). In\naddition, a computational efficiency study for various propagators is performed\nto speed-up the calculations on classical computers. These computations are\nrepeated for the simulation of the SES approach assuming typical parameters for\nrealistic pretheshold superconducting quantum computing hardware. The\nfeasibility of applying future SES processors to the quantum dynamics of large\nmolecular collision systems is briefly discussed.\n", "  Particle transport through a duct by Lambertian reflection from duct walls is\nagain considered. This popular transport example has been solved by most\nnumerical transport methods except notably one- the method of doubling. We\nshall show that the method of doubling provides every bit as, or more, accurate\nreflectances and transmittances as the numerical discrete ordinates (NDO) and\nanalytical discrete ordinates (ADO) methods with less mathematical and\nnumerical effort.\n", "  Under investigation in this paper is the higherorder nonlinear Schrodinger\nand Maxwell-Bloch (HNLSMB) system which describes the wave propagation in an\nerbium-doped nonlinear fiber with higher-order effects including the\nfourth-order dispersion and quintic nonKerr nonlinearity. The breather and\nrogue wave (RW) solutions are shown that they can be converted into various\nsoliton solutions including the multipeak soliton, periodic wave, antidark\nsoliton, M-shaped soliton, and W-shaped soliton. In addition, under different\nvalues of higher-order effect, the locus of the eigenvalues on the complex\nplane which converts breathers or RWs into solitons is calculated.\n", "  This article reviews recent research on the collective dynamical behavior of\ncolloids with dipolar or multipolar interactions. Indeed, whereas equilibrium\nstructures and static self-assembly of such systems are now rather well\nunderstood, the past years have seen an explosion of interest in understanding\ndynamicals aspects, from the relaxation dynamics of strongly correlated dipolar\nnetworks over systems driven by time-dependent, electric or magnetic fields, to\npattern formation and dynamical control of active, self-propelled systems.\nUnraveling the underlying mechanisms is crucial for a deeper understanding of\nself-assembly in and out of equilibrium and the use of such particles as\nfunctional devices. At the same time, the complex dynamics of dipolar colloids\nposes challenging physical questions and puts forward their role as model\nsystems for nonlinear behavior in condensed matter physics. Here we attempt to\ngive an overview of these developments, with an emphasis on theoretical and\nsimulation studies.\n", "  The production of hydrogen from water using only a catalyst and solar energy\nis one of the most challenging and promising outlets for the generation of\nclean and renewable energy. Semiconductor photocatalysts for solar hydrogen\nproduction by water photolysis must employ stable, non-toxic, abundant and\ninexpensive visible-light absorbers capable of harvesting light photons with\nadequate potential to reduce water. Here, we show that a-Fe2O3 can meet these\nrequirements by means of using hydrothermally prepared nanorings. These iron\noxide nanoring photocatalysts proved capable of producing hydrogen efficiently\nwithout application of an external bias. In addition, Co(OH)2 nanoparticles\nwere shown to be efficient co-catalysts on the nanoring surface by improving\nthe efficiency of hydrogen generation. Both nanoparticle-coated and uncoated\nnanorings displayed superior photocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution\nwhen compared with TiO2 nanoparticles, showing themselves to be promising\nmaterials for water-splitting using only solar light.\n", "  In this paper, we present the results on the gravitational collapse of\ncharged massless scalar field in asymptotically flat spacetime with a perfectly\nreflecting wall. Differing from previous works, we study the system in the\ndouble null coordinates, by which we could simulate the system until the black\nhole forms with higher precision but less performance time. We investigate the\ninfluence of charge on the black hole formation and the scaling behavior near\nthe critical collapses. The gapless and gapped critical behaviors for black\nhole mass and charge are studied numerically. We find that they satisfy the\nscaling laws for critical gravitational collapse but the gapped critical\nbehavior is different from its AdS counterpart.\n", "  We illustrate the usefulness of functional equations in establishing\nrelationships between master integrals under the integration-by-parts reduction\nprocedure by considering a certain two-loop propagator-type diagram as an\nexample.\n", "  Tin sulphide thin films of p-type conductivity were grown on glass\nsubstrates. The refractive index of the as grown films, calculated using both\nTransmission and ellipsometry data were found to follow the Sellmeier\ndispersion model. The improvement in the dispersion data obtained using\nellipsometry was validated by Wemple-Dedomenico (WDD) single oscillator model\nfitting. The optical properties of the films were found to be closely related\nto the structural properties of the films. The band-gap, its spread and\nappearance of defect levels within the band-gap intimately controls the\nrefractive index of the films.\n", "  In the framework of Lagrangian perturbation theory in general relativity we\ndiscuss the possibility to split the Einstein equations, written in terms of\nspatial Cartan coframes within a 3+1 foliation of spacetime, into\ngravitoelectric and gravitomagnetic parts. While the former reproduces the full\nhierarchy of the Newtonian perturbation solutions, the latter contains\nnon-Newtonian aspects like gravitational waves. This split can be understood\nand made unique through the Hodge decomposition of Cartan coframe fields.\n", "  Precise knowledge of the strange and antistrange quark distributions of the\nnucleon is a major step toward better understanding of the strong interaction\nand the nucleon structure. Moreover, the $ s-\\bar s $ asymmetry in the nucleon\nplays an important role in some physical processes involving hadrons. The goal\nof this paper is the study of intrinsic strange contribution to the strange sea\nof the nucleon. To this aim, we calculate the intrinsic strange distributions\nfrom the various light-cone models including BHPS, scalar five-quark and\nmeson-baryon models and then compare their results. These models can lead to\nthe rather different distributions for the intrinsic strange that are dominated\nin different values of $ x $. Furthermore, the meson-baryon model leads to the\n$ s-\\bar s $ asymmetry that can be comparable in some situations to the result\nobtained from the global analysis of PDFs. We also present a simple\nparametrization for each model prediction of intrinsic strange distribution.\n", "  We study the low temperature thermodynamics of the quantum Heisenberg\nferromagnet in three dimension for any value of the spin $ S \\geq 1/2 $. We\nreport on a rigorous proof of the validity of the spin-wave approximation for\nthe excitation spectrum, at the level of the first non-trivial contribution to\nthe free energy as the inverse temperature $ \\beta \\to \\infty $.\n", "  We study the orbital angular momentum contribution to the spin structure of\nthe proton. It is well known that the quark and gluon spin contributions do not\nadd up to the proton spin. We motivate the connection between the Generalized\nTransverse Momentum Distribution (GTMD) $F_{14}$, and orbital angular momentum\nby exploring the underlying quark proton helicity amplitude structure. The\ntwist three Generalized Parton Distribution (GPD) $\\tilde{E}_{2T}$, was shown\nto connect to OAM. We study these functions using a diquark model calculation.\nThe GTMD $F_{14}$ is unique in that it can describe both Jaffe-Manohar and Ji\nOAM depending on choice of gauge link, i.e. whether final state interactions\nare included or not. We perform a calculation of $F_{14}$ in both scenarios.\n", "  The host galaxies of nearby (z<0.3) core-collapse supernovae and\nlong-duration gamma-ray bursts offer an excellent means of probing the\nenvironments and populations that produce these events' varied massive\nprogenitors. These same young stellar progenitors make LGRBs and SNe valuable\nand potentially powerful tracers of star formation, metallicity, the IMF, and\nthe end phases of stellar evolution. However, properly utilizing these\nprogenitors as tools requires a thorough understanding of their formation and,\nconsequently, the physical properties of their parent host environments. This\nreview looks at some of the recent work on LGRB and SN hosts with resolved\nenvironments that allows us to probe the precise explosion sites and\nsurrounding environments of these events in incredible detail.\n", "  After revival of the concept of minimal length, many investigations have been\ndevoted, in literature, to estimate upper-bound on minimal length for systems\nlike hydrogen atom, deuteron etc. We report here a possible origin of minimal\nlength for atomic and nuclear systems which is connected with the fundamental\ninteraction strength and the Compton wavelength. The formula we appear at is\nnumerically close to the upper-bounds found in literature.\n", "  It is shown that the standard expression of the vector part of the hadronic\nmatrix element in weak charged-current proton-neutron transitions is in\nagreement with the CVC hypothesis, contrary to a different claim in a recent\npaper.\n", "  Recently published and preliminary results of the TOTEM experiment are\npresented, emphasizing a recent discovery of a non-exponential behaviour of the\ndifferential cross-section of elastic proton-proton scattering, that TOTEM\nmeasured with an unprecedented precision at the centre-of-mass energy\n$\\sqrt{s}$ = 8 TeV based on a high-statistics data sample obtained with the\n$\\beta_* = 90$ m optics of CERN LHC. Both the statistical and systematic\nuncertainties remained below 1%, except for the t-independent contribution from\nthe overall normalisation. This measurement allowed TOTEM to exclude a purely\nexponential differential cross-section in the range of four-momentum transfer\nsquared 0.027 < |t| < 0.2 GeV$^2$ with a significance greater than 7 $\\sigma$.\nIn this context we also highlight the innovative TOTEM recalibration of LHC\noptics, that used elastic scattering data measured by the world's largest and\nmost complex Roman Pot detector system, and discuss recent preliminary TOTEM\ndata on the Coulomb-Nuclear interference region with its physics implications.\n", "  A mechanical model is introduced for predicting the initiation and evolution\nof complex fracture patterns without the need for a damage variable or law. The\nmodel, a continuum variant of Newton's second law, uses integral rather than\npartial differential operators where the region of integration is over finite\ndomain. The force interaction is derived from a novel nonconvex strain energy\ndensity function, resulting in a nonmonotonic material model. The resulting\nequation of motion is proved to be mathematically well-posed. The model has the\ncapacity to simulate nucleation and growth of multiple, mutually interacting\ndynamic fractures. In the limit of zero region of integration, the model\nreproduces the classic Griffith model of brittle fracture. The simplicity of\nthe formulation avoids the need for supplemental kinetic relations that dictate\ncrack growth or the need for an explicit damage evolution law.\n", "  During 2014-15, there were several outbreaks of nominated-based online social\ncontagion. These infections, which were transmitted from one individual to\nanother via posts on social media, included games such as 'neknomination', 'ice\nbucket challenge', 'no make up selfies', and Facebook users re-posting their\nfirst profile pictures. Fitting a mathematical model of infectious disease\ntransmission to outbreaks of these four games in the United Kingdom, I\nestimated the basic reproduction number, $R_0$, and generation time of each\ninfection. Median estimates for $R_0$ ranged from 1.9-2.5 across the four\noutbreaks, and the estimated generation times were between 1.0 and 2.0 days.\nTests using out-of-sample data from Australia suggested that the model had\nreasonable predictive power, with $R^2$ values between 0.52-0.70 across the\nfour Australian datasets. Further, the relatively low basic reproduction\nnumbers for the infections suggests that only 48-60% of index cases in\nnomination-based games may subsequently generate major outbreaks.\n", "  We present a novel ab-initio single-electron approach to correlated electron\ndynamics in strong laser fields. By writing the electronic wavefunction as a\nproduct of a marginal one-electron wavefunction and a conditional wavefunction,\nwe show that the exact harmonic spectrum can be obtained from a single-electron\nSchr\\\"odinger equation. To obtain the one-electron potential in practice, we\npropose an adiabatic approximation, i.e. a potential is generated that depends\nonly on the position of one electron. This potential, together with the laser\ninteraction, is then used to obtain the dynamics of the system. For a model\nHelium atom in a laser field, we show that by using our approach, the\nhigh-order harmonic generation spectrum can be obtained to a good\napproximation.\n", "  The concept of the deep trapping gate device was introduced fairly recently\non the basis of technological and transport simulations currently used in the\nfield of classical electron devices. The concept of a buried gate containing\nlocalized deep level centers for holes (Deep Trapping Gate or DTG) renders\npossible the operation of this field effect pixel detector. One alternative to\nDeep Level introduction is the use of a quantum box, which is a hole\nquantum-well and an electron barrier. In all of these cases the buried gate\nmodulates the drain-source current. This principle was formerly evaluated with\nrealistic simulations parameters and this shows that a measurable signal is\nobtained for an energy deposition of a minimum-ionizing particle within a\nlimited silicon thickness. In this work a quantitative study of the response of\nsuch a pixel to Minimum Ionizing Particles. The influence of some parameters\nsuch as the thickness of the pixel and its lateral dimensions, on the operation\nof the pixel is studied here using current available simulation tools, in\nquantum mode when a narrow Ge layer is used as a buried gate. A bias sequence\nis introduced here to separate the operation of the pixel in detection and\nreadout mode. The first frabrication technique introduced is deep impurity\nimplantation, followed by annealing. Recent work on quantum boxes and dots\nopens the possibility to the use Ge boxes as a DTG.Ion implantation and\nalternative methods such an epitaxial growth DTG can be reasonably considered.\nIf the related bottlenecks are overcome the pixel should be a good candidate\nfor high luminosity particle collider inner detectors, provides that its\npotential radiation hardness is proven sufficient for these applications.\n", "  Present and future space missions rely on systems of increasingly demanding\nperformance for being successful. Drag-free technology is one of the\ntechnologies that is fundamental for LISA-Pathfinder, an ESA mission whose\nlaunch is planned for the end of September 2015. A purely drag-free object is\ndefined by the absence of all external forces other than gravity. This is not a\nnatural condition and thus requires a proper design of a spacecraft, whose core\nis an object in free-fall, called test mass (TM). The purity of the drag-free\norbit depends on the spacecraft capability of protecting the TM from\ndisturbances, which indeed has limitations. According to a NASA study, such a\nconcept provides substantial economies for LEO satellites. At the same time, a\ndrag-free motion is required in many missions of fundamental physics. eLISA is\nan ESA concept mission aimed at opening a new window to the universe, black\nholes, and massive binary systems by means of gravitational waves.\nLISA-Pathfinder is in charge of proving the eLISA concept. In this frame, the\nsystem holding the TM during launch and releasing it in free-fall before the\nscience phase represents a single point of failure for the whole mission. This\nthesis describes the phenomena, operations, issues, tests, activities, and\nsimulations linked to the release following a system engineering approach.\nExperimental studies have been carried out to investigate this phenomenon in\nconditions representative of the LISA-Pathfinder flight environment. The last\npart of the thesis is dedicated to the preliminary design of the housing of the\nTM in the frame of a low-cost mission conceived at Stanford (USA). The ambition\nof this work is increasing the maturity of the technology needed in drag-free\nprojects and therefore provide a starting point for future fascinating and\nchallenging missions of this kind.\n", "  Transient premixed hydrogen/air flames contracting through inhomogeneous fuel\ndistributions and subjected to stretch and pressure oscillations are\ninvestigated numerically using an implicit method which couples the fully\ncompressible flow to the realistic chemistry and multicomponent transport\nproperties. The impact of increasing {\\em negative} stretch is investigated\nthrough the use of planar, cylindrical and spherical geometries, and a\ncomparison with the results from {\\em positively} stretched expanding H2/air\nflames (MALIK2010) and CH4/air flames (MALIK2012a) is made. A flame relaxation\nnumber $n_R=\\tau_R/\\tau_L$ ($\\tau_R$ is the time that the flame takes to return\nto the mean equilibrium conditions after initial disturbance; $\\tau_L$ is a\nflame time scale) decreases by 10\\% with increasing {\\em negative} stretch, in\ncontrast to the two expanding flames where $n_R$ decreased by 40\\% with\nincreasing {\\em positive} stretch. $n_R$ appears to much more sensitive to\nvariations in positive/negative curvature than to the thermo-chemistry of\ndifferent flame types. $n_R$ may thus be a useful indicator of the strength of\nflame-curvature coupling. The spectra of pressure fluctuations $E_p(\\omega)$\nscale close to $\\sim\\omega^{-3}$, which is steeper than in the expanding H2/air\nflames where $E_p(\\omega)\\sim\\omega^{-2}$. Rapid transport ('flapping') of the\nflame front by the largest convective velocities induced by the random pressure\nfluctuations is prominent because of the lack of gas velocity ahead of the\nflame, $u_g=0$. 'Memory effects' between fuel consumption and the rate of heat\nrelease is obscured by the flapping, although the contracting flames display\nshort time-lags in the mean.\n", "  We have investigated current-current correlations in a cross-shaped conductor\nmade of graphene ribbons. We measured auto and cross correlations and compared\nthem with the theoretical predictions for ideal diffusive conductors. Our data\ndeviate from these predictions and agreement can be obtained only by adding\ncontributions from occupation-number noise in the central region connecting the\narms of the cross. Furthermore, we have determined Hanbury -- Brown and Twiss\n(HBT) exchange correlations in this system. Contrary to expectations for a\ncross-shaped diffusive system, we find finite HBT exchange effects due to the\noccupation-number noise at the crossing. The strength of these HBT exchange\ncorrelations is found to vary with gate voltage, and very a distinct HBT effect\nwith large fluctuations is observed near the Dirac point.\n", "  Many-particles quantum walks of particles obeying Bose statistics moving on\ngraphs of various topologies are introduced. A single coin tossing commands the\nconditional shift operation over the whole graph. Vertices particle densities,\nthe mean values of the phase space variables, second order spatial correlation\nand counting statistics are evaluated and simulated. Evidence of an universal\ndynamics is presented.\n", "  Oxygen octahedra tilting is a common structural phenomenon in perovskites and\nhas been subject of intensive studies, particularly in rhombohedral Pb(Zr,Ti)O3\n(PZT). Early reports suggest that the tilted octahedra may strongly affect the\ndomain switching behavior, dielectric and piezoelectric properties of PZT\nceramics. In a way similar to that proposed for tilts, however, charged\ndefects, associated with oxygen vacancies, may also inhibit the motion of the\ndomain walls, resulting macroscopically in pinched hysteresis loops and reduced\npiezoelectric response. Here, we revisit the early studies on rhombohedral PZT\nceramics with tilted octahedra by considering a possible role of both tilts and\ncharged defects on domain-wall motion. We show that the observed pinched\nhysteresis loops are likely associated with the presence of defect complexes\ncontaining charged oxygen vacancies, and not tilts as suggested in some cases.\nRegardless of the presence or absence of long-range ordered tilts in\nrhombohedral PZT, the effect of charged defects is also prominent in weak-field\npermittivity and piezoelectric properties, particularly at sub-Hz driving\nconditions where the conductivity, related to the motion of oxygen vacancies,\ngives rise to strong frequency dispersion.\n", "  First-principles molecular dynamics simulation based on a plane\nwave/pseudopotential implementation of density functional theory is adopted to\ninvestigate atomic scale energy transport for semiconductors (silicon and\ngermanium). By imposing thermostats to keep constant temperatures of the\nnanoscale thin layers, initial thermal non-equilibrium between the neighboring\nlayers is established under the vacuum condition. Models with variable gap\ndistances with an interval of lattice constant increment of the simulated\nmaterials are set up and statistical comparisons of temperature evolution\ncurves are made. Moreover, the equilibration time from non-equilibrium state to\nthermal equilibrium state of different silicon or/and germanium layers\ncombinations are calculated. The results show significant distinctions of heat\ntransfer under different materials and temperatures combinations. Further\ndiscussions on the equilibrium time are made to explain the simulation results.\nAs the first work of the atomic scale energy transport spanning from heat\nconduction to thermal radiation, the simulation results here highlights the\npromising application of the first-principles molecular dynamics in thermal\nengineering.\n", "  The structural, dynamic, and vibrational properties during the heat transfer\nprocess in Si/Ge superlattices, are studied by analyzing the trajectories\ngenerated by the ab initio Car-Parrinello molecular dynamics simulation. The\nradial distribution functions and mean square displacements are calculated and\nfurther discussions are made to explain and probe the structural changes\nrelating to the heat transfer phenomenon. Furthermore, the vibrational density\nof states of the two layers (Si/Ge) are computed and plotted to analyze the\ncontributions of phonons with different frequencies to the heat conduction.\nCoherent heat conduction of the low frequency phonons is found and their\ncontributions to facilitate heat transfer are confirmed. The Car-Parrinello\nmolecular dynamics simulation outputs in the work show reasonable\nthermophysical results of the thermal energy transport process and shed light\non the potential applications of treating the heat transfer in the\nsuperlattices of semiconductor materials from a quantum mechanical molecular\ndynamics simulation perspective.\n", "  An ab initio molecular dynamics study of femtosecond laser processing of\ngermanium is presented in this paper. The method based on the finite\ntemperature density functional theory is adopted to probe the structural\nchange, thermal motion of the atoms, dynamic property of the velocity\nautocorrelation, and the vibrational density of states. Starting from a cubic\nsystem at room temperature (300 K) containing 64 germanium atoms with an\nordered arrangement of 1.132 nm in each dimension, the femtosecond laser\nprocessing is simulated by imposing the Nose Hoover thermostat to the\nelectronic subsystem lasting for ~100 fs and continuing with microcanonical\nensemble simulation of ~200 fs. The simulation results show solid, liquid and\ngas phases of germanium under adjusted intensities of the femtosecond laser\nirradiation. We find the irradiated germanium distinguishes from the usual\ngermanium crystal by analyzing their melting and dynamic properties.\n", "  The goal of this study is to develop an approximate self-consistent\ndescription of particle motion in strongly magnetised solar corona. We derive a\nset of reduced drift-kinetic equations based on the assumption that the\ngyro-velocity distribution is Maxwellian. The equations are tested using simple\n1D models.\n", "  For a thermal conductivity that is spatially uniform and independent of\ntemperature, Fourier's law of heat transfer predicts a curl-free heat-flux. In\nthe quasi-ballistic phonon transport regime, where the Fourier law breaks down,\nit has been proven starting from the Boltzmann transport equation that the\nconstitutive relation for the heat-flux contains a solenoidal (circulatory)\nterm with zero divergence and non-zero curl. In this paper we show how to\nreduce the effective thermal conductivity of a material with dimensions on the\nsame scale as the phonon mean-free path, by exploiting the solenoidal term in\nthe constitutive relation.\n", "  We have developed an apparatus to search for the higher-order Lorentz\nviolation in photons by measuring the resonant frequency difference between two\ncounterpropagating directions of an asymmetric optical ring cavity. From the\nyear-long data taken between 2012 and 2013, we found no evidence for the light\nspeed anisotropy at the level of $\\delta c/c \\lesssim 10^{-15}$. Limits on the\ndipole components of the anisotropy are improved by more than an order of\nmagnitude, and limits on the hexapole components are obtained for the first\ntime. An overview of our apparatus and the data analysis in the framework of\nthe spherical harmonics decomposition of anisotropy are presented. We also\npresent the status of the recent upgrade of the apparatus.\n", "  We find that existing multi-party quantum key agreement (MQKA) protocols\ndesigned for fairness of the key are, in fact, unfair. Our analysis shows that\nthese protocols are sensitive to collusive attacks; that is, dishonest\nparticipants can collaborate to predetermine the key without being detected. In\nfact, the transmission structures of the quantum particles in those unfair MQKA\nprotocols, three of which have already been analyzed, have much in common. We\ncall these unfair MQKA protocols circle-type MQKA protocols. Likewise, the\ntransmission structures of the quantum particles in MQKA protocols that can\nresist collusive attacks are also similar. We call such protocols\ncomplete-graph-type MQKA protocols. A MQKA protocol also exists that can resist\nthe above attacks but is still not fair, and we call it the tree-type MQKA\nprotocol. We first point out a common, easily missed loophole that severely\ncompromises the fairness of present circle-type MQKA protocols. Then we show\nthat two dishonest participants at special positions can totally predetermine\nthe key generated by circle-type MQKA protocols. We anticipate that our\nobservations will contribute to secure and fair MQKA protocols, especially\ncircle-type protocols.\n", "  Theoretical and experimental characterizations of Mn2CrGa compound in regard\nto the possibility of phase transformation have been carried out in this work.\nUnder a high ordering L21 structure, this compound has the potential to be a\nmartensite phase transition material. However, experimental results show a\nsevere disordering took place in this system, which forbids the occurring of\nthe phase transition. This work provides important reference for the design of\nnew phase transition materials in Heusler alloys.\n", "  We discuss quantum capacities for two types of entanglement networks:\n$\\mathcal{Q}$ for the quantum repeater network with free classical\ncommunication, and $\\mathcal{R}$ for the tensor network as the rank of the\nlinear operation represented by the tensor network. We find that $\\mathcal{Q}$\nalways equals $\\mathcal{R}$ in the regularized case for the samenetwork graph.\nHowever, the relationships between the corresponding one-shot capacities\n$\\mathcal{Q}_1$ and $\\mathcal{R}_1$ are more complicated, and the min-cut upper\nbound is in general not achievable. We show that the tensor network can be\nviewed as a stochastic protocol with the quantum repeater network, such that\n$\\mathcal{R}_1$ is a natural upper bound of $\\mathcal{Q}_1$. We analyze the\npossible gap between $\\mathcal{R}_1$ and $\\mathcal{Q}_1$ for certain networks,\nand compare them with the one-shot classical capacity of the corresponding\nclassical network.\n", "  Based on a method that produces the solutions to the Schrodinger equations of\npartner potentials, we give two conditionally exactly solvable partner\npotentials of exponential type defined on the half line. These potentials are\nmultiplicative shape invariant and each of their linearly independent solution\nincludes a sum of two hypergeometric functions. Furthermore we calculate the\nscattering amplitudes and study some of their properties.\n", "  Correlated electron microscopy and cathodoluminescence (CL) imaging using\nfunctionalized nanoparticles is a promising nanoscale probe of biological\nstructure and function. Nanodiamonds (NDs) that contain CL-emitting color\ncenters are particularly well suited for such applications. The intensity of CL\nemission from NDs is determined by a combination of factors, including:\nparticle size; density of color centers; efficiency of energy deposition by\nelectrons passing through the particle; and conversion efficiency from\ndeposited energy to CL emission. We report experiments and numerical\nsimulations that investigate the relative importance of each of these factors\nin determining CL emission intensity from NDs containing nitrogen-vacancy (NV)\ncolor centers. In particular, we find that CL can be detected from NV-doped NDs\nwith dimensions as small as ~ 40 nm, although CL emission decreases\nsignificantly for smaller NDs.\n", "  In recent years, the relationship of collaboration among scientists and the\ncitation impact of papers have been frequently investigated. Most of the\nstudies show that the two variables are closely related: an increasing\ncollaboration activity (measured in terms of number of authors, number of\naffiliations, and number of countries) is associated with an increased citation\nimpact. However, it is not clear whether the increased citation impact is based\non the higher quality of papers which profit from more than one scientist\ngiving expert input or other (citation-specific) factors. Thus, the current\nstudy addresses this question by using two comprehensive datasets with\npublications (in the biomedical area) including quality assessments by experts\n(F1000Prime member scores) and citation data for the publications. The study is\nbased on nearly 10,000 papers. Robust regression models are used to investigate\nthe relationship between number of authors, number of affiliations, and number\nof countries, respectively, and citation impact - controlling for the papers'\nquality (measured by F1000Prime expert ratings). The results point out that the\neffect of collaboration activities on impact is largely independent of the\npapers' quality. The citation advantage is apparently not quality-related;\ncitation specific factors (e.g. self-citations) seem to be important here.\n", "  The trajectory and the orbital velocity are determined for an object moving\nin a gravitational system, in terms of fundamental and independent variables.\nIn particular, considering a path on equipotential line, the elliptical orbit\nis naturally traced, verifying evidently the keplerian laws. The case of the\nplanets of the solar system is presented.\n", "  The branching fractions of radiative leptonic $\\tau$ decays $(\\tau \\to l \\nu\n\\bar{\\nu} \\gamma$, $l=e,\\mu)$ were recently measured by the Babar collaboration\nwith a relative error of about 3%. The measurement of the branching ratio\n$\\mathcal{B} (\\tau \\to e \\bar{\\nu} \\nu \\gamma)$, for a minimum photon energy of\n10 MeV in the $\\tau$ rest frame, differs from our recent SM prediction by 3.5\nstandard deviations, whereas our result agrees with Babar's value for\n$\\mathcal{B} (\\tau \\to \\mu \\bar{\\nu} \\nu \\gamma)$. Our predictions also agree\nwith the measurement of $\\mathcal{B} (\\mu \\to e \\bar{\\nu} \\nu \\gamma)$ by the\nMEG collaboration. We also report on a recent proposal to test the $\\tau$\ndipole moments via precise measurements of radiative leptonic $\\tau$ decays at\nhigh-luminosity $B$ factories.\n", "  Classical field theory is considered as a theory of unparametrized surfaces\nembedded in a configuration space, which accommodates, in a symmetric way,\nspacetime positions and field values. Dynamics is defined via the (Hamiltonian)\nconstraint between multivector-valued generalized momenta, and points in the\nconfiguration space. Starting from a variational principle, we derive the local\nequations of motion, that is, differential equations that determine classical\nsurfaces and momenta. A local Hamilton-Jacobi equation applicable in the field\ntheory then follows readily. In addition, we discuss the relation between\nsymmetries and conservation laws, and derive a Hamiltonian version of the\nNoether theorem, where the Noether currents are identified as the classical\nmomentum contracted with the symmetry-generating vector fields. The general\nformalism is illustrated by two examples: the scalar field theory, and the\nstring theory.\n  Throughout the article, we employ the mathematical formalism of geometric\nalgebra and calculus, which allows us to perform completely coordinate-free\nmanipulations.\n", "  We study a system of independent Brownian particles in a flashing ratchet\npotential that can be turned on or off depending on the position of the\nparticles, with the aim of maximising the speed of the center of mass in the\nlong run. First, an explanation on how to find the optimal protocol using\nBellman's principle of optimality for any number of particles is given. Then\nthe problem is numerically solved for a system of 2 particles. Simulations show\nthat the optimal protocol performs better than the maximisation of\ninstantaneous center-of-mass speed, a protocol known to give better results for\n2 particles than any open-loop protocol.\n", "  We study, by means of a Monte Carlo simulator, the hot phonon effect on the\nrelaxation dynamics in photoexcited graphene and its quantitative impact as\ncompared to considering an equilibrium phonon distribution. Our multi-particle\napproach indicates that neglecting the hot phonon effect significantly\nunderestimates the relaxation times in photoexcited graphene. The hot phonon\neffect is more important for a higher energy of the excitation pulse and\nphotocarrier densities between $1$ and $3\\times 10^{12} \\mathrm{~cm}^{-2}$.\nAcoustic intervalley phonons play a non-negligible role, and emitted phonons\nwith wavelengths limited up by a maximum (determined by the carrier\nconcentration) induce a slower carrier cooling rate. Intrinsic phonon heating\nis damped in graphene on a substrate due to additional cooling pathways, with\nthe hot phonon effect showing a strong inverse dependence with the carrier\ndensity.\n", "  We introduce a scheme for the parallel storage of frequency separated signals\nin an optical memory and demonstrate that this dual-rail storage is a suitable\nmemory for high fidelity frequency qubits. The two signals are stored\nsimultaneously in the Zeeman-split Raman absorption lines of a cold atom\nensemble using gradient echo memory techniques. Analysis of the split-Zeeman\nstorage shows that the memory can be configured to preserve the relative\namplitude and phase of the frequency separated signals. In an experimental\ndemonstration dual-frequency pulses are recalled with 35% efficiency, 82%\ninterference fringe visibility, and 6 degrees phase stability. The fidelity of\nthe frequency-qubit memory is limited by frequency-dependent polarisation\nrotation and ambient magnetic field fluctuations, our analysis describes how\nthese can be addressed in an alternative configuration.\n", "  The effect of the two-nucleon excitation from $p$ to $sd$ shell is discussed\nin $^{12}$C and $^{14}$C in the frame work of shell model. The recently\nsuggested shell-model Hamiltonian YSOX provides an suitable tool to investigate\nthe $2~\\hbar\\omega$ excitation in $psd$ region. Because the strength of the\n$<pp|V|sdsd>$ interaction, which represents the interaction between the\n$0~\\hbar\\omega$ and $2~\\hbar\\omega$ configurations, is considered in the\nconstruction of the YSOX. The level of $^{12}$C is almost independent on the\n$<pp|V|sdsd>$ interaction, but excitation energies of certain states in\n$^{14}$C are strongly affected by it. Further investigation shows that the\npercentage of $2~\\hbar\\omega$ configuration in these states is quite different\nfrom that of the ground state.\n", "  We explore the behaviour of the inverse reduced density fluctuations and the\nisobaric expansion coefficient using {\\alpha},{\\omega}-dibromoalkanes as an\nexample. Two different states are revealed far from the critical point: the\nregion of exponentially decaying fluctuations near the coexistence curve and\nthe state with longer correlations under sufficiently high pressures. The\ncrossing of the isotherms of the isobaric expansion coefficient occurs within\nthe PVT range of the mentioned transition. We discuss the interplay of this\ncrossing with the changes in molecular packing structure connected with the\nanalysed function of the density, which represents inverse reduced volume\nfluctuations.\n", "  The simulation of turbulent combustion phenomena is still an open problem in\nmodern fluid dynamics. Considering the economical importance of hydrocarbon\ncombustion in energy production processes, it is evident the need of an\naccurate tool with a relatively low computational cost for the prediction of\nthis kind of reacting flows. In the present work, a comparative study is\ncarried out among large eddy simulations, performed with various grid\nresolutions, a Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes simulation, and experimental\ndata concerning the well-known Sandia D flame test case. In all the\nsimulations, a flamelet progress variable model has been employed using various\nhypotheses for the joint probability density function closure. The filtered\napproach proved to be more accurate than the averaged one, even for the coarser\ngrid used in this work. In fact both approaches have shown poorly accurate\npredictions in the first part of the combustion chamber, but only by the large\neddy simulation one is capable to recover the inlet discrepancies with respect\nto the experimental data going along the streamwise direction.\n", "  This work presents a comparative analysis of Influenzanet data for influenza\nitself and common cold in the Netherlands during the last 5 years, from the\npoint of view of modelling by linearised SIRS equations parametrically driven\nby the ambient temperature. It is argued that this approach allows for the\nforecast of common cold, but not of influenza in a strict sense. The difference\nin their kinetic models is discussed with reference to the clinical background.\n", "  By using the blob theory and computer simulations, we investigate the\nproperties of a linear polymer performing a stationary rotational motion around\na long impenetrable rod. In particular, in the simulations the rotation is\ninduced by a torque applied to the end of the polymer that is tethered to the\nrod. Three different regimes are found, in close analogy with the case of\npolymers pulled by a constant force at one end. For low torques the polymer\nrotates maintaining its equilibrium conformation. At intermediate torques the\npolymer assumes a trumpet shape, being composed by blobs of increasing size. At\neven larger torques the polymer is partially wrapped around the rod. We derive\nseveral scaling relations between various quantities as angular velocity,\nelongation and torque. The analytical predictions match the simulation data\nwell. Interestingly, we find a \"thinning\" regime where the torque has a very\nweak (logarithmic) dependence on the angular velocity. We discuss the origin of\nthis behavior, which has no counterpart in polymers pulled by an applied force.\n", "  In this letter, we introduce the astrophysical observations into the wormhole\nresearch, which is not meant to general parameters constraints for the dark\nenergy models, in order to understand more about in which stage of the universe\nevolutions wormholes may exist through the investigation of the evolution\nbehavior of the cosmic equation of state parameter. As a concrete instance, we\ninvestigate the Ricci dark energy (RDE) traversable wormholes constrained by\nastrophysical data-sets. Particularly, we can discover from Fig. \\ref{fig5} of\nthe present work, when the effective equation of state parameter $\\omega_X<-1$,\nnamely, the Null Energy conditions (NEC) is violated clearly, the wormholes\nwill appear (open). Subsequently, six specific solutions of static and\nspherically symmetric traversable wormhole supported by the RDE are obtained.\nExcept for the case of constant redshift function, in which the solution is not\nonly asymptotically flat but also traversable, the remaining five solutions are\nall not asymptotically flat, therefore, the exotic matter from the RDE fluids\nis spatially distributed in the vicinity of the throat. Furthermore, we analyze\nthe physical characteristics and properties of the RDE traversable wormholes.\nIt is worth noting that, through the astrophysical observations, we get\nconstraints on the parameters of RDE model, explore the type of exotic RDE\nfluids in different stages of the universe changing, limit the number of\navailable models for wormhole research, reduce the number of the wormholes\ncorresponding to different parameters for RDE model and provide a more apparent\npicture for wormhole investigations from the new perspective of observational\ncosmology background\n", "  The process of crumpling a sheet and compacting it into a ball is dependent\non many parameters that are difficult to disentangle. We study the effect of\nplasticity on the crumpling process, and disentangle the effects of plasticity\nand dimensionality of compaction by performing isotropic compaction experiments\non various materials with different elastoplasticities. The force required to\ncrumple a sheet into a ball as well as the number of layers inside the ball\nhave a power-law dependence on the size of the crumpled ball, each with its own\npower-law exponent. We experimentally determine both exponents and find that\nthey are linearly proportional to and decrease with increasing plasticity of\nthe material. Finally we provide a scaling argument predicting a linear\nrelation between the two exponents with a coefficient of 3.5 in excellent\nagreement with our experimental results.\n", "  In 2011, a re-evaluation of the antineutrino spectrum emitted by nuclear\nreactors revealed a 6% deficit between the observed flux and the expected one.\nThis anomaly is significant at 2.9$\\sigma$ and can be explained by a new\noscillation at short range due to a light sterile neutrino, with parameter\n$\\Delta m^2=\\mathcal{O}(\\text{eV})$. The STEREO detector in construction at ILL\nwill be the first ever to measure with precision its antineutrino spectrum and\nflux at very short distance (9-11m) and it will be able to confirm or reject\nthe existence of this light sterile neutrino. In the following we introduce the\nrelevant parameter to study the neutrino oscillation, then the STEREO detector\nand its discovery potential.\n", "  Social network research has begun to take advantage of fine-grained\ncommunications regarding coordination, decision-making, and knowledge sharing.\nThese studies, however, have not generally analyzed how external events are\nassociated with a social network's structure and communicative properties.\nHere, we study how external events are associated with a network's change in\nstructure and communications. Analyzing a complete dataset of millions of\ninstant messages among the decision-makers in a large hedge fund and their\nnetwork of outside contacts, we investigate the link between price shocks,\nnetwork structure, and change in the affect and cognition of decision-makers\nembedded in the network. When price shocks occur the communication network\ntends not to display structural changes associated with adaptiveness. Rather,\nthe network \"turtles up\". It displays a propensity for higher clustering,\nstrong tie interaction, and an intensification of insider vs. outsider\ncommunication. Further, we find changes in network structure predict shifts in\ncognitive and affective processes, execution of new transactions, and local\noptimality of transactions better than prices, revealing the important\npredictive relationship between network structure and collective behavior\nwithin a social network.\n", "  The Hilbert space for three fermions in six orbitals, lately dubbed the\n\"Borland-Dennis setting,\" is a proving ground for insights into electronic\nstructure. Borland and Dennis discovered that, when referred to coordinate\nsystems defined in terms of its natural orbitals, a wave function in the\nBorland-Dennis setting has the same structure as a 3-qubit state. By dint of\nthe Borland-Dennis Theorem, canonical forms for 3-qubit states have analogs in\nthe Borland-Dennis setting.\n  One of these canonical forms is based upon \"max-overlap Slater determinant\napproximations.\" Any max-overlap Slater determinant approximation of a given\nwave function is the leading term in a 5-term configuration interaction (CI)\nexpansion of that wave function. Our main result is that \"max-overlap CIS\napproximations\" also lead to 5-term CI expansions, distinct from those based on\nmax-overlap Slater determinant approximations, though of the same symmetric\nshape. We also prove the analog of this result for 3-qubit setting.\n", "  Generalized second law of thermodynamics in the Bianchi type I universe with\nthe generalized holographic Ricci dark energy model is studied in this paper.\nThe behavior of dark energy's equation of state parameter indicates that it is\nmatter-like in the early time of the universe but phantom-like in the future.\nBy analysing the evolution of the deviations of state parameter and the total\npressure of the universe, we find that for an anisotropic Bianchi type I\nuniverse, it transits from a high anisotropy stage to a more homogeneous stage\nin the near past. Using the normal entropy given by Gibbs' law of\nthermodynamics, it is proved that the generalized second law of thermodynamics\ndoes not always satisfied throughout the history of the universe when we assume\nthe universe is enclosed by the generalized Ricci scalar radius $R_{gr}$. It\nbecomes invalid in the near past to the future, and the formation of the\ngalaxies will be helpful in explaining such phenomenon, for that the galaxies's\nformation is an entropy increase process. The negative change rates of the\nhorizon entropy and internal entropy occur in different period indicates that\nthe influences of galaxies formation is wiped from internal to the universe's\nhorizon.\n", "  In this paper we derive the type-II integrable defect for the N = 2\nsupersymmetric sinh-Gordon (sshG) model by using the fusing procedure. In\nparticular, we show explicitly the conservation of the modified energy,\nmomentum and supercharges.\n", "  For detailed explanation of the experimental results of lepton production\ncross section in hadronic collisions such as nucleon-nucleon or nucleon-nuclei,\nit is of great importance to use quarks and sea quarks distribution function\ninside free and bound nucleons. In this paper the role of pion cloud inside the\nnucleus in the structure function of Cu and Pt nuclei and the EMC ratio of\nthese nuclei were investigated by using harmonic oscillator model.\n", "  The Rayleigh--Taylor instability which is responsible for the occurrence of\nnarrow upward jets are studied in the scope of the nonhydrostatic model with\nhorizontally--nonuniform density and the Newtonian cooling. As analysis shows,\nthe total hierarchy of instabilities in this model consists of three regimes --\ncollapse, algebraic instability, and inertial motion. Realization of these\nstages, mutual transitions and interference depend on a ratio between two\ncharacteristic time scales -- collapse time and cooling time.\n", "  Single layers of MoS2 and MoSe2 were optically pumped with circularly\npolarized light and an appreciable polarization was initialized as the pump\nenergy was varied. The circular polarization of the emitted photoluminescence\nwas monitored as function of the difference between the excitation energy and\nthe A-exciton emission at the K-point of the Brillouin zone. Our results show a\nthreshold of twice the LA phonon energy, specific to the material, above which\nphonon-assisted intervalley scattering causes depolarization. In both materials\nthis lead to almost complete depolarization within ~100 meV above the threshold\nenergy. We identify the extra kinetic energy of the exciton (independent of\nwhether it is neutral or charged) as the key parameter for presenting a\nunifying picture of the depolarization process.\n", "  We review a package of no-go results in axiomatic quantum field theory with\nHaag's theorem at its centre. Since the concept of operator-valued\ndistributions in this framework comes very close to what we believe canonical\nquantum fields are about, these results are of consequence to quantum field\ntheory: they suggest the seeming absurdity that this highly victorious theory\nis incapable of describing interactions. We single out unitarity of the\ninteraction picture's intertwiner as the most salient provision of Haag's\ntheorem and critique canonical perturbation theory to argue that\nrenormalisation bypasses Haag's theorem by violating this very assumption.\n", "  There has been considerable interest in spin-orbit torques for the purpose of\nmanipulating the magnetization of ferromagnetic (FM) films or nano-elements for\nspintronic technologies. Spin-orbit torques are derived from spin currents\ncreated from charge currents in materials with significant spin-orbit coupling\nthat diffuse into an adjacent FM material. There have been intensive efforts to\nsearch for candidate materials that exhibit large spin Hall angles, i.e.\nefficient charge to spin current conversion. Here we report, using spin torque\nferromagnetic resonance, the observation of a giant spin Hall angle of up to\n~0.35 in (100) oriented single crystalline antiferromagnetic (AF) IrMn3 thin\nfilms, coupled to ferromagnetic permalloy layers, and a spin Hall angle that is\nabout three times smaller in (111) oriented films. For the (100) oriented\nsamples we show that the magnitude of the spin Hall angle can be significantly\nchanged by manipulating the populations of the various AF domains through field\nannealing. Using ab-initio calculations we show that the triangular AF\nstructure of IrMn3 gives rise to a substantial intrinsic spin Hall conductivity\nthat is three times larger for the (100) than for the (111) orientations,\nconsistent with our experimental findings.\n", "  Forecasts and analyses of cosmological observations often rely on the\nassumption of a perfect theoretical model over a defined range of scales. We\nexplore how model uncertainties and nuisance parameters in perturbative models\nof the matter and galaxy spectra affect constraints on neutrino mass and\nprimordial non-Gaussianities. We provide a consistent treatment of theoretical\nerrors and argue that their inclusion is a necessary step to obtain realistic\ncosmological constraints. We find that galaxy surveys up to high redshifts will\nallow a detection of the minimal neutrino mass and local non-Gaussianity of\norder unity, but improving the constraints on equilateral non-Gaussianity\nbeyond the CMB limits will be challenging. We argue that similar considerations\napply to analyses where theoretical models are based on simulations.\n", "  We calculate the low temperature one-particle scattering rate and the\nspecific heat in a weakly disordered metal close to a quantum critical point.\nTo lowest order in the fluctuation potential, we obtain typical Fermi-liquid\nresults proportional to T^2 and T respectively, with prefactors which diverge\nas a power law of the control parameter upon approaching the critical point.\nThe Kadowaki-Woods ratio is shown to be independent of the control parameter\nonly for the case of 3-D FM fluctuations. Our work is relevant for experiments\non CeCoIn$_5$ and Sr_3Ru_2O_7.\n", "  We examine theories of gravity which include finitely many coupled scalar\nfields with arbitrary couplings to the curvature (wavemaps). We show that the\nmost general scalar-tensor $\\sigma$-model action is conformally equivalent to\ngeneral relativity with a minimally coupled wavemap with a particular target\nmetric. Inflation on the source manifold is then shown to occur in a novel way\ndue to the combined effect of arbitrary curvature couplings and wavemap\nself-interactions. A new interpretation of the conformal equivalence theorem\nproved for such `wavemap-tensor' theories through brane-bulk dynamics is also\ndiscussed.\n"]}
