If quantum bits (qubits) are sufficiently\nreliable, errors are sparse and quantum error correction (QEC) is capable of\nidentifying and correcting them. Adding more qubits improves the preservation\nby guaranteeing increasingly larger clusters of errors will not cause logical\nfailure - a key requirement for large-scale systems. Using QEC to extend the\nqubit lifetime remains one of the outstanding experimental challenges in\nquantum computing. Here, we report the protection of classical states from\nenvironmental bit-flip errors and demonstrate the suppression of these errors\nwith increasing system size. We use a linear array of nine qubits, which is a\nnatural precursor of the two-dimensional surface code QEC scheme, and track\nerrors as they occur by repeatedly performing projective quantum non-demolition\n(QND) parity measurements. Relative to a single physical qubit, we reduce the\nfailure rate in retrieving an input state by a factor of 2.7 for five qubits\nand a factor of 8.5 for nine qubits after eight cycles. Additionally, we\ntomographically verify preservation of the non-classical\nGreenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state. The successful suppression of\nenvironmentally-induced errors strongly motivates further research into the\nmany exciting challenges associated with building a large-scale superconducting\nquantum computer.\n", "  We propose theory for reversible quantum transducer connecting\nsuperconducting qubits and optical photons using acoustic waves in\npiezoelectrics. The proposed device consists of integrated acousto-optic\nresonator that utilizes stimulated Brillouin scattering for phonon-photon\nconversion, and piezoelectric effect for coupling of phonons to qubits. We\nevaluate the phonon-photon coupling rate, and show that the required power of\noptical pump as well as the other device parameters providing full and faithful\nquantum conversion are feasible for implementation with the state of the art\nintegrated acousto-optics.\n", "  In this paper we present a study of a general system coupled to a reservoir\nconsisting of nonlinear oscillators, based on perturbation theory at the\nclassical level. We extend the standard Zwanzig approach of elimination of bath\ndegrees of freedom order by order in perturbation. We observe that the\nFluctuation Dissipation Relation (FDR) in its standard form for harmonic baths\ngets modified due to the nonlinearity and this is manifested through higher\npowers of kBT in the expression for two-time noise correlation.As an aside, we\nalso observe that the first moment of the noise arising from a nonlinear bath\ncan be non-zero, even in absence of any external drive, if the reservoir\npotential is asymmetric with respect to one of its minima, about which one\nbuilds up the perturbation theory.\n", "  In [1] a new method to measure the speed of light through Baryon Acoustic\nOscillations (BAO) was introduced. Here, we describe in much more detail the\ntheoretical basis of that method, its implementation, and give some newly\nupdated results about its application to the forecast data. In particular, we\nwill show that SKA will be able to detect a 1% variation (if any) in the speed\nof light at 3$\\sigma$ level. Smaller signals will be hardly detected by\nalready-planned future galaxy surveys, but we give indications about what\nsensitivity requirements should a survey fulfill in order to be successful.\n", "  By virtue of the integration method within P-ordered product of operators and\nthe property of entangled state representation, we reveal new physical\ninterpretation of the generalized two-mode squeezing operator (GTSO), and find\nit be decomposed as the product of free-space propagation operator, single-mode\nand two-mode squeezing operators, as well as thin lens transformation operator.\nThis docomposition is useful to design of opticl devices for generating various\nsqueezed states of light. Transformation of entangled state representation\ninduced by GTSO is emphasized.\n", "  The KM2A(one kilometer square extensive air shower array) is the largest\ndetector array in the LHAA- SO(Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory)\nproject. The KM2A consists of 5635 EDs(Electromagnetic particle Detectors) and\n1221 MDs(Muon Detectors). The EDs are distributed and exposed in the wild. Two\nchannels, Anode and Dynode, are employed for the PMT(photomultiplier tube)\nsignal readout. The readout electronics proposed in this paper aims at the\naccurate charge and arrival time measurement of the PMT signals, which cover a\nlarge amplitude range from 20P.E(photoelectrons) to 2x10^5 P.E. By using the\nTrigger-less architecture, we digitize signals close to the PMTs. All digitized\ndata is transmitted to DAQ(Data Acquisition) via the simplified WR(White\nRabbit) protocol. Compared with traditional high energy experiments,\nhigh-precision of time measurement in such a large area and suppression of\ntemperature effects in the wild become the key techniques. Experiments show\nthat the design has fulfilled the requirements in this project.\n", "  The lifetimes of the lower-lying vibrational states of ultralong-range\nstrontium Rydberg molecules comprising one ground-state 5s2 1S0 atom and one\nRydberg atom in the 5s38s 3S1 state are reported. The molecules are created in\nan ultracold gas held in an optical dipole trap and their numbers determined\nusing field ionization, the product electrons being detected by a microchannel\nplate. The measurements show that, in marked contrast to earlier measurements\ninvolving rubidium Rydberg molecules, the lifetimes of the low-lying molecular\nvibrational states are very similar to those of the parent Rydberg atoms. This\nresults because the strong p-wave resonance in low-energy electronrubidium\nscattering, which plays an important role in determining the molecular\nlifetimes, is not present for strontium. The absence of this resonance offers\nadvantages for experiments involving strontium Rydberg atoms as impurities in\nquantum gases and for testing theories of molecular formation and decay.\n", "  We present scattering cross sections $\\sigma_\\text{scatt}$ of ultracold\nneutrons (UCN) in liquid deuterium at T = 20.6 K, as recently measured by means\nof a transmission experiment. The indispensable thorough raw data treatment\nprocedure is explained. A calculation model for coherent and incoherent\nscattering in liquid deuterium in the hydrodynamic limit based on appropriate\nphysical concepts is provided and shown to fit the data well. The applicability\nof the incoherent approximation for UCN scattering in liquid deuterium was\ntested and found to deliver acceptable results.\n", "  A mechanically coupled phase-field model is proposed for the first time to\nsimulate the peculiar behavior of relaxor ferroelectrics. Based on the random\nfield theory for relaxors, local random fields are introduced to characterize\nthe effect of chemical disorder. This generic model is developed from a\nthermodynamic framework and the microforce theory and is implemented by a\nnonlinear finite element method. Simulation results show that the model can\nreproduce relaxor features, such as domain miniaturization, small remnant\npolarization and large piezoelectric response. In particular, the influence of\nrandom field strength on these features are revealed. Simulation results on\ndomain structure and hysteresis behavior are discussed and compared with\nrelated experimental results.\n", "  To begin with, it is pointed out that the form of the quantum probabil- ity\nformula originates in the very initial state of the object system as seen when\nthe state is expanded with the eigen-projectors of the measured ob- servable.\nMaking use of the probability reproducibility condition, which is a key concept\nin unitary measurement theory, one obtains the relevant coher- ent distribution\nof the complete-measurement results in the final unitary- measurement state in\nagreement with the mentioned probability formula. Treating the transition from\nthe final unitary, or premeasurement, state, where all possible results are\npresent, to one complete-measurement result sketchily in the usual way, the\nwell-known probability formula is derived. In conclusion it is pointed out that\nthe entire argument is only formal unless one makes it physical assuming that\nthe quantum probability law is valid in the extreme case of probability-one\n(certain) events (projectors).\n", "  The thermodynamic properties of the superconducting state in the amorphous\n${\\rm Sn_{1-x}Cu_{x}}$ thin films have been characterized. The concentration of\ncopper changes in the range from $0.08$ to $0.41$. The calculations have been\nconducted in the framework of the strong-coupling formalism, wherein the\nEliashberg functions determined in the tunnel experiment (Phys. Rev. B {\\bf\n51}, 685 (1995)) have been used. The value of the Coulomb pseudopotential equal\nto $0.1$ has been adopted. It has been found that the critical temperature\n($T_{C}$) decreases from $7$ K to $3.9$ K. The ratio of the energy gap to the\ncritical temperature: $R_{\\Delta}=2\\Delta\\left(0\\right)/k_{B}T_{C}$, differs\nsignificantly from the BCS value: $R_{\\Delta}\\in\\left<4.4,3.95\\right>$.\nSimilarly behaves the ratio of the specific heat jump to the specific heat of\nthe normal state: $R_{C}=\\Delta C\\left(T_{C}\\right)/C^{N}\\left(T_{C}\\right)$,\nand the parameter:\n$R_{H}=T_{C}C^{N}\\left(T_{C}\\right)/H^{2}_{C}\\left(0\\right)$, where\n$H_{C}\\left(0\\right)$ is the thermodynamic critical field. In particular,\n$R_{C}\\in\\left<2.2,1.75\\right>$ and $R_{H}\\in\\left<0.141,0.154\\right>$.\n", "  It is universally accepted that the cubic, nonlinear Schr\u007fodinger equation\n(NLS) models the dynamics of narrow-bandwidth wave packets consisting of short\ndispersive waves, while the Kortewegde Vries equation (KdV) models the\npropagation of long waves in dispersive media. A system that couples the two\nequations seems attractive to model the interaction of long and short waves and\nsuch a system has been studied over the last few decades. However, questions\nabout the validity of the system in the study of water waves were raised in our\nprevious work where we presented our analysis using the fifth-order KdV as the\nstarting point. In this paper, these questions are settled unequivocally as we\nshow that the NLS-KdV system or even the linear Schr\u007fodinger-KdV system cannot\nbe resulted from the full Euler equations formulated in the study of water\nwaves.\n"]}
