This\nwork gives a simple algorithm that does it, based on the weak coin flipping\nprotocol with arbitrarily small bias derived by Mochon in 2007, and recently\npublished and simplified in Aharonov et al in 2016. A protocol with linear\nnumber of coin flipping rounds is quite simple to achieve; We further provide\nan improvement to logarithmic number of coin flipping rounds. This is a much\nimproved journal version of a preprint posted in 2009: many typos are\ncorrected, proofs are more rigorous and accurate, and the analysis of\ncomplexity is significantly tightened which gives a stronger result in terms of\nefficiency; The first protocol with linear number of rounds, was achieved\nindependently also by Aharon and Silman in 2010.\n", "  Measurements of the magnetic susceptibility of Fe/W(110) films with thickness\nin the range of 1.6 to 2.4 ML Fe, show that in addition to the large response\nalong the easy axis associated with the Curie transition, there is a much\nsmaller, paramagnetic hard axis response that is not consistent with the 2D\nanisotropic Heisenberg model used to describe homogeneous in-plane ferromagnets\nwith uniaxial anisotropy. The shape, amplitude, and peak temperature of the\nhard axis susceptibility, as well as its dependence upon layer completion close\nto 2.0 ML, indicate that inhomogeneities in the films create a system of mixed\nanisotropy. A likely candidate for inhomogeneities that are magnetically\nrelevant in the critical region are the closed lines of step edges associated\nwith the incomplete layers. According to the Harris criterion, the existence of\nmagnetically relevant inhomogeneities may alter the critical properties of the\nfilms from those of a 2D Ising model. Experiments in the recent literature are\ndiscussed in this context.\n", "  A binary mixture of interacting Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) in the\npresence of fragmentation-driving external lattice potentials forms two\ninterdependent mean-field lattices made of each component. These effective\nmean-field lattices, like ordinary optical lattices, can induce additional\nfragmentation and phase coherence loss of BECs between lattice sites. In this\nstudy, we consider the nonequilibrium dynamics of two hyperfine states of\none-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensates, subjected to state-dependent optical\nlattices. Our numerical calculations using the truncated Wigner approximation\n(TWA) show that phase coherence in a mixture of two-component BECs can be lost\nnot just by optical lattices, but by mean-field lattices gradually formed by\nother components, and we reveal that such an effect of internal mean-field\nlattices, however, is limited, contrary to external optical lattices, in regard\nto phase decoherence.\n", "  A formalism for studying the dynamics of quantum systems embedded in\nclassical spin baths is introduced. The theory is based on generalized\nantisymmetric brackets and predicts the presence of open-path off-diagonal\ngeometric phases in the evolution of the density matrix. The weak coupling\nlimit of the equation can be integrated by standard algorithms and provides a\nnon-Markovian approach to the computer simulation of quantum systems in\nclassical spin environments. It is expected that the theory and numerical\nschemes presented here have a wide applicability.\n", "  We study a number of filtering schemes for the reduction of the statistical\nerror in non-adiabatic calculations by means of the quantum-classical Liouville\nequation. In particular, we focus on a scheme based on setting a threshold\nvalue on the sampling weights, so that when the threshold is overcome the value\nof the weight is reset, and on another approach which prunes the ensemble of\nthe allowed non-adiabatic transitions according to a generalised sampling\nprobability. Both methods have advantages and drawbacks, however their\ncombination drastically improves the performance of an algorithm known as the\nSequential Short Time Step Propagation [D. MacKernan et al., J. Phys: Condens.\nMatter {\\bf 14} 9069 (2002)], which is derived from a simple first order\nexpansion of the quantum-classical propagator. Such an algorithm together with\nthe combined filtering procedures produce results that compare very well with\nthose obtained by means of numerically \"exact\" quantum calculations for the\nspin-boson model, even for intermediate and strong coupling regimes.\n", "  The action of certain static magnetic fields on charged test particles is\ninterpreted as a consequence of the interaction of the particles with electric\ndipole distributions emitted by other charged particles in relative motion. The\ndipole model of electric forces was initially conceived to emulate Coulomb's\nlaw, but is applied here to a wide class of phenomena, such as forces between\nparallel conductors, a relativistic correction of Biot--Savart's law, and the\nmagnetic moment of a current loop.\n", "  The problem of constructing semi-discrete integrable analogues of the\nLiouville type integrable PDE is discussed. We call the semi-discrete equation\na discretization of the Liouville type PDE if these two equations have a common\nintegral. For the Liouville type integrable equations from the well-known\nGoursat list for which the integrals of minimal order are of the order less\nthan or equal to two we presented a list of corresponding semi-discrete\nversions. The list contains new examples of non-autonomous Darboux integrable\nchains.\n", "  In this paper a formalism for studying the dynamics of quantum systems\ncoupled to classical spin environments is reviewed. The theory is based on\ngeneralized antisymmetric brackets and naturally predicts open-path\noff-diagonal geometric phases in the evolution of the density matrix. It is\nshown that such geometric phases must also be considered in the\nquantum-classical Liouville equation for a classical bath with canonical phase\nspace coordinates; this occurs whenever the adiabatics basis is complex (as in\nthe case of a magnetic field coupled to the quantum subsystem). When the\nquantum subsystem is weakly coupled to the spin environment, non-adiabatic\ntransitions can be neglected and one can construct an effective non-Markovian\ncomputer simulation scheme for open quantum system dynamics in classical spin\nenvironments. In order to tackle this case, integration algorithms based on the\nsymmetric Trotter factorization of the classical-like spin propagator are\nderived. Such algorithms are applied to a model comprising a quantum two-level\nsystem coupled to a single classical spin in an external magnetic field.\nStarting from an excited state, the population difference and the coherences of\nthis two-state model are simulated in time while the dynamics of the classical\nspin is monitored in detail. It is the author's opinion that the numerical\nevidence provided in this paper is a first step toward developing the\nsimulation of quantum dynamics in classical spin environments into an effective\ntool. In turn, the ability to simulate such a dynamics can have a positive\nimpact on various fields, among which, for example, nano-science.\n", "  Several papers provide evidences that the most probable sites of flare onset\nare the regions of high horizontal magnetic field gradients in solar active\nregions. Besides the localization of flare producing areas the present work\nintends to reveal the characteristic temporal variations in these regions prior\nto flares. This study uses sunspot data instead of magnetograms, it follows the\nbehaviour of a suitable defined proxy measure representing the horizontal\nmagnetic field gradient. The source of the data is the SDD (SOHO/MDI-Debrecen\nData) sunspot catalogue. The most promising pre-flare signatures are the\nfollowing properties of the gradient variation: i) steep increase, ii) high\nmaximum, iii) significant fluctuation and iv) a gradual decrease between the\nmaximum and the flare onset which can be related to the \"pull mode\" of the\ncurrent layer. These properties may yield a tool for the assessment of flare\nprobability and intensity within the next 8-10 hours.\n", "  Using N-body simulations we study the phenomenon of radial orbit instability\noccurring in dark matter haloes of the size of a dwarf galaxy. We carried out\nsimulations of seven spherical models, with the same standard NFW density\nprofile but different anisotropy profiles of particle orbits. Four of them\nunderwent instability: two with a constant positive anisotropy, one with an\nanisotropic core and an isotropic envelope and one with a very small isotropic\ncore and an anisotropic envelope. Haloes affected by the instability become\napproximately axisymmetric and prolate, with the profile of the\nshortest-to-longest axis ratio increasing with radius. The lower limit for the\ncentral value of this axis ratio is 0.3 for an NFW halo. The density profiles\nof the haloes did not change significantly, whereas the velocity distributions\nbecame axisymmetric. The total angular momentum rose due to large-amplitude\noscillations of its components perpendicular to the symmetry axis of the halo.\nWe also studied orbits of individual particles assigning them to classical\norbit families in triaxial potentials. We find that the membership of a given\nparticle in a family depends on its initial total angular momentum and its\ncomponents along the principal axes of matter distribution.\n", "  The probability distribution of the number $s$ of distinct sites visited up\nto time $t$ by a random walk on the fully-connected lattice with $N$ sites is\nfirst obtained by solving the eigenvalue problem associated with the discrete\nmaster equation. Then, using generating function techniques, we compute the\njoint probability distribution of $s$ and $r$, where $r$ is the number of sites\nvisited only once up to time $t$. Mean values, variances and covariance are\ndeduced from the generating functions and their finite-size-scaling behaviour\nis studied. Introducing properly centered and scaled variables $u$ and $v$ for\n$r$ and $s$ and working in the scaling limit ($t\\to\\infty$, $N\\to\\infty$ with\n$w=t/N$ fixed) the joint probability density of $u$ and $v$ is shown to be a\nbivariate Gaussian density. It follows that the fluctuations of $r$ and $s$\naround their mean values in a finite-size system are Gaussian in the scaling\nlimit. The same type of finite-size scaling is expected to hold on periodic\nlattices above the critical dimension $d_{\\rm c}=2$.\n", "  {We point out some obstacles raised by the lost of symmetry against the\nextension to the case of an interacting particle of the approach that {\\sl\ndeductively} establishes the Quantum Theory of a free particle according to the\ngroup theoretical methods worked out by Bargmann, Mackey and Wigner. Then we\ndevelop an approach which overcomes these difficulties in the non relativistic\ncase. According to our approach the different specific forms of the wave\nequation of an interacting particle are implied by particular first order\ninvariance properties that characterize the interaction with respect to\nspecific sub-groups of galileian transformations. Moreover, the possibility of\nyet unknown forms of the wave equation is left open.\n", "  Adiabatic quantum computing~(AQC) is based on the adiabatic principle, where\na quantum system remains in an instantaneous eigenstate of the driving\nHamiltonian. The final state of the Hamiltonian encodes solution to the problem\nof interest. While AQC has distinct advantages, recent researches have shown\nthat quantumness such as quantum coherence in adiabatic processes may be lost\nentirely due to the system-bath interaction when the evolution time is long,\nand consequently the expected quantum speedup dose not show up. Here we propose\na fast-signal assisted adiabatic quantum algorithm. We find that by applying a\nsequence of fast random or regular signals during the evolution process, the\nruntime can be reduced greatly, yet advantages of the adiabatic algorithm\nremain intact. Significantly, we present a \\emph{randomized} Trotter formula\nand show that the driving Hamiltonian and the sequence of fast signals can be\nimplemented simultaneously. We apply the algorithm for solving the $3$-bit\nexact cover problem~(EC$3$) and put forward an approach for implementing the\nproblem with trapped ions.\n", "  A quantum memory or information processing device is subject to disturbance\nfrom its surrounding environment or inevitable leakage due to its contact with\nother systems. To tackle these problems, several control protocols have been\nproposed for quantum memory or storage. Among them, the fast-signal control or\ndynamical decoupling based on external pulse sequences provides a prevailing\nstrategy aimed at suppressing decoherence and preventing the target systems\nfrom the leakage or diffusion process. In this paper, we review the\napplications of this protocol in protecting quantum memory under the\nnon-Markovian dissipative noise and maintaining systems on finite speed\nadiabatic passages without leakage there-from. We analyze leakage and control\nperturbative and nonperturbative dynamical equations including second-order\nmaster equation, quantum-state-diffusion equation, and one-component master\nequation derived from Feshbach PQ-partitioning technique. It turns out that the\nquality of fast-modulated signal control is insensitive to configurations of\nthe applied pulse sequences. Specifically, decoherence and leakage will be\ngreatly suppressed as long as the control sequence is able to effectively shift\nthe system beyond the bath cutoff frequency, almost independent of the details\nof the control sequences which could be ideal pulses, regular rectangular\npulses, random pulses and even noisy pulses.\n", "  Let $(M,J,\\omega)$ be a quantizable compact K\\\"ahler manifold, with\nquantizing Hermitian line bundle $(A,h)$, and associated Hardy space $H(X)$,\nwhere $X$ is the unit circle bundle. Given a collection of $r$ Poisson\ncommuting quantizable Hamiltonian functions $f_j$ on $M$, there is an induced\nAbelian unitary action on $H(X)$, generated by certain T\\\"oplitz operators\nnaturally induced by the $f_j$'s. As a multi-dimensional analogue of the usual\nWeyl law and trace formula, we consider the problem of describing the\nasymptotic clustering of the joint eigenvalues of these T\\\"oplitz operators\nalong a given ray, and locally on $M$ the asymptotic concentration of the\ncorresponding joint eigenfunctions. This problem naturally leads to a \\lq\ndirectional local trace formula\\rq, involving scaling asymptotics in the\nneighborhood of certain special loci in $M$. Under natural transversality\nassumption, we obtain asymptotic expansions related to the local geometry of\nthe Hamiltonian action and flow.\n", "  We introduce a formalism for time-dependent correlation functions for systems\nwhose evolutions are governed by non-Hermitian Hamiltonians of general type. It\nturns out that one can define two different types of time correlation\nfunctions. Both these definitions seem to be physically consistent while\nbecoming equivalent only in certain cases. Moreover, when autocorrelation\nfunctions are considered, one can introduce another function defined as the\nrelative difference between the two definitions. We conjecture that such a\nfunction can be used to assess the positive semi-definiteness of the density\noperator without computing its eigenvalues. We illustrate these points by\nstudying analytically a number of models with two energy levels.\n", "  We generalize the Point information gain (PIG) and derived quantities, i.e.\nPoint information entropy (PIE) and Point information entropy density (PIED),\nfor the case of R\\'enyi entropy and simulate the behavior of PIG for typical\ndistributions. We also use these methods for the analysis of multidimensional\ndatasets. We demonstrate the main properties of PIE/PIED spectra for the real\ndata on the example of several images, and discuss possible further utilization\nin other fields of data processing.\n", "  The Aharonov-Bohm effect is considered by most authors as a quantum effect,\nbut a generally accepted explanation does not seem to be available. The\nphenomenon is studied here under the assumption that hypothetical electric\ndipole distributions configured by moving charges in the solenoid act on the\nelectrons as test particles. The relative motions of the interacting charged\nparticles introduce relativistic time dilations. The massless dipoles are\npostulated as part of an impact model that has recently been proposed to\naccount for the far-reaching electrostatic forces between charged particles\ndescribed by Coulomb's law. The model provides a quantitative explanation of\nthe Aharonov-Bohm effect.\n", "  We propose a scheme for precise control of tunneling dynamics of dipolar\nbosons in shaken triple-well potentials. In the high-frequency regimes and\nunder the resonance conditions, we have analytically and numerically\ndemonstrated that we can transport a priori prescribed number of dipolar bosons\nalong different pathways and different directions by adjusting the driving\nparameters. These results extend the previous many-body selective coherent\ndestruction of tunneling (CDT) schemes for nondipolar bosons in double-well\npotentials[Phys. Rev. Lett. 103, 133002 (2009); Phys. Rev. A 86, 044102\n(2012)], thus offering an efficient way to design the long-range coherent\nquantum transportation.\n", "  Quantum systems with a non-conserved probability can be described by means of\nnon-Hermitian Hamiltonians and non-unitary dynamics. In this paper, the case in\nwhich the degrees of freedom can be partitioned in two subsets with light and\nheavy masses is treated. A classical limit over the heavy coordinates is taken\nin order to embed the non-unitary dynamics of the subsystem in a classical\nenvironment. Such a classical environment, in turn, acts as an additional\nsource of dissipation (or noise), beyond that represented by the non-unitary\nevolution. The non-Hermitian dynamics of a Heisenberg two-spin chain, with the\nspins independently coupled to harmonic oscillators, is considered in order to\nillustrate the formalism.\n", "  The forecast method introduced by Kors\\'os et al.(2014) is generalised from\nthe horizontal magnetic gradient (GM), defined between two opposite polarity\nspots, to all spots within an appropriately defined region close to the\nmagnetic neutral line of an active region. This novel approach is not limited\nto searching for the largest GM of two single spots as in previous methods.\nInstead, the pre-flare conditions of the evolution of spot groups is captured\nby the introduction of the weighted horizontal magnetic gradient, or W_GM. This\nnew proxy enables the potential of forecasting flares stronger than M5. The\nimproved capability includes (i) the prediction of flare onset time and (ii) an\nassessment whether a flare is followed by another event within about 18 hours.\nThe prediction of onset time is found to be more accurate here. A linear\nrelationship is established between the duration of converging motion and the\ntime elapsed from the moment of closest position to that of the flare onset of\nopposite polarity spot groups. The other promising relationship is between the\nmaximum of the W_GM prior to flaring and the value of W_GM at the moment of the\ninitial flare onset in the case of multiple flaring. We found that when the\nW_GM decreases by about 54%, then there is no second flare. If, however, when\nthe W_GM decreases less than 42%, then there will be likely a follow-up flare\nstronger than M5. This new capability may be useful for an automated flare\nprediction tool.\n", "  Tentative evidence for excess GeV-scale gamma rays from the galactic center\nhas been corroborated by several groups, including the Fermi collaboration, on\nwhose data the observation is based. Dark matter annihilation into standard\nmodel particles has been shown to give a good fit to the signal for a variety\nof final state particles, but generic models are inconsistent with constraints\nfrom direct detection. Models where the dark matter annihilates to mediators\nthat subsequently decay are less constrained. We perform global fits of such\nmodels to recent data, allowing branching fractions to all possible fermionic\nfinal states to vary. The best fit models, including constraints from the\nAMS-02 experiment (and also antiproton ratio), require branching primarily to\nmuons, with a $\\sim 10-20\\%$ admixture of $b$ quarks, and no other species.\nThis suggests models in which there are two scalar mediators that mix with the\nHiggs, and have masses consistent with such a decay pattern. The scalar that\ndecays to $\\mu^+\\mu^-$ must therefore be lighter than $2m_\\tau \\cong 3.6$ GeV.\nSuch a small mass can cause Sommerfeld enhancement, which is useful to explain\nwhy the best-fit annihilation cross section is larger than the value needed for\na thermal relic density. For light mediator masses $\\sim (0.2-2)$ GeV, it can\nalso naturally lead to elastic DM self-interactions at the right level for\naddressing discrepancies in small structure formation as predicted by\ncollisionless cold dark matter.\n", "  Heavy quarkonia, Bc-meson, and CS-meson masses are calculated within the\nframework of the N-dimensional radial Schrodinger equation. The Cornell\npotential is extended by including the harmonic oscillator potential. The\nenergy eigenvalues and the corresponding wave functions are calculated in the\nN-dimensional space using the Nikiforov-Uvarov (NV) method. The energy\neigenvalues are obtained in the three-dimensional space. The mass of spectra of\ncharmonium, bottomonium, and mesons are calculated. The effect of\ndimensionality number on the mass of quarkonium is investigated. A comparison\nwith other theoretical approaches is discussed. The obtained results are in\ngood agreement with experimental data. We conclude that the dimensionality\nnumber plays an important role in studying the spectra of quarkonium masses.\nThe modified Cornell potential provides a good description of the spectra of\nquarkonium masses.\n", "  We consider a random walk on the fully-connected lattice with $N$ sites and\nstudy the time evolution of the number of distinct sites $s$ visited by the\nwalker on a subset with $n$ sites. A record value $v$ is obtained for $s$ at a\nrecord time $t$ when the walker visits a site of the subset for the first time.\nThe record time $t$ is a partial covering time when $v<n$ and a total covering\ntime when $v=n$. The probability distributions for the number of records $s$,\nthe record value $v$ and the record (covering) time $t$, involving $r$-Stirling\nnumbers, are obtained using generating function techniques. The mean values,\nvariances and skewnesses are deduced from the generating functions. In the\nscaling limit the probability distributions for $s$ and $v$ lead to the same\nGaussian density. The fluctuations of the record time $t$ are also Gaussian at\npartial covering, when $n-v={\\mathrm O}(n)$. They are distributed according to\nthe type-I Gumbel extreme-value distribution at total covering, when $v=n$. A\ndiscrete sequence of generalized Gumbel distributions, indexed by $n-v$, is\nobtained at almost total covering, when $n-v={\\mathrm O}(1)$. These generalized\nGumbel distributions are crossing over to the Gaussian distribution when $n-v$\nincreases.\n", "  We simulate the dynamics of a quantum dot coupled to the single resonating\nmode of a metal nano-particle. Systems like this are known as metamolecules. In\nthis study, we consider a time-dependent driving field acting onto the\nmetamolecule. We use the Heisenberg equations of motion for the entire system,\nwhile representing the resonating mode in Wigner phase space. A time-dependent\nbasis is adopted for the quantum dot. We integrate the dynamics of the\nmetamolecule for a range of coupling strengths between the quantum dot and the\ndriving field, while restricting the coupling between the quantum dot and the\nresonant mode to weak values. By monitoring the average of the time variation\nof the energy of the metamolecule model, as well as the coherence and the\npopulation difference of the quantum dot, we observe distinct non-linear\nbehavior in the case of strong coupling to the driving field.\n", "  We consider a model in which dark matter is a composite baryon of a dark\nsector governed by $SU(3)$ gauge theory, with vector-like quarks also charged\nunder $U(1)_Y$. The model provides simple answer to the dark matter stability\nproblem: it is a result of the accidental dark baryon number conservation. And\nwith an analogy to QCD, all physical quantities of the dark matter can be\ncalculated by rescaling the QCD experimental results. According to the thermal\nfreeze-out mechanism the mass of the dark matter is predicted to be\n$\\mathcal{O}(100)$~TeV in order to achieve a correct relic abundance. Such\nheavy dark matter is in general hard for detection due to small dark matter\nnumber density in the universe. However, dark baryon number in our model is not\nnecessarily strictly preserved thanks to operators suppressed by the Planck\nscale, and such decay operator results in a decay lifetime marginal to the\ncurrent detection bound. We show our model with $\\mathcal{O}(10^{27})~s$ dark\nmatter decay life time can explain the AMS-02 anti-proton data, if it is\nexperimentally interpreted as an access, although some theoretical uncertainty\nmay weaken its significance. We also investigate other phenomena of this model\nsuch as the extragalactic gamma ray and neutrino signatures.\n", "  Relying on an exact time evolution scheme, we identify a novel transient\nenergy transfer phe- nomenon in an exactly-solvable quantum microscopic model\nconsisting of a three-level system coupled to two non-Markovian\nzero-temperature bosonic baths through two separable quantum channels. The\ndynamics of this model can be solved exactly using the quantum-state-diffusion\nequation formalism, demonstrating finite intervals of unidirectional energy\nflow across the system, typically, from the non-Markovian environment towards\nthe more Markovian bath. Furthermore, when introducing a spatial asymmetry into\nthe system, an analogue of the rectification effect is realized. In the long\ntime limit, the dynamics arrives at a stationary state and the effects recede.\nUnderstanding temporal characteristics of directional energy flow will aid in\ndesigning microscopic energy transfer devices.\n", "  We consider the KPZ equation in one space dimension driven by a stationary\ncentred space-time random field, which is sufficiently integrable and mixing,\nbut not necessarily Gaussian. We show that, in the weakly asymmetric regime,\nthe solution to this equation considered at a suitable large scale and in a\nsuitable reference frame converges to the Hopf-Cole solution to the KPZ\nequation driven by space-time Gaussian white noise. While the limiting process\ndepends only on the integrated variance of the driving field, the diverging\nconstants appearing in the definition of the reference frame also depend on\nhigher order moments.\n", "  Multilayer networks are a useful data structure for simultaneously capturing\nmultiple types of relationships between a set of nodes. In such networks, each\nrelational definition gives rise to a layer. While each layer provides its own\nset of information, community structure across layers can be collectively\nutilized to discover and quantify underlying relational patterns between nodes.\nTo concisely extract information from a multilayer network, we propose to\nidentify and combine sets of layers with meaningful similarities in community\nstructure. In this paper, we describe the \"strata multilayer stochastic block\nmodel'' (sMLSBM), a probabilistic model for multilayer community structure. The\ncentral extension of the model is that there exist groups of layers, called\n\"strata'', which are defined such that all layers in a given stratum have\ncommunity structure described by a common stochastic block model (SBM). That\nis, layers in a stratum exhibit similar node-to-community assignments and SBM\nprobability parameters. Fitting the sMLSBM to a multilayer network provides a\njoint clustering that yields node-to-community and layer-to-stratum\nassignments, which cooperatively aid one another during inference. We describe\nan algorithm for separating layers into their appropriate strata and an\ninference technique for estimating the SBM parameters for each stratum. We\ndemonstrate our method using synthetic networks and a multilayer network\ninferred from data collected in the Human Microbiome Project.\n", "  Using the two dimensional $XY-(S(O(3))$ model as a test case, we show that\nanalysis of the Fisher zeros of the canonical partition function can provide\nsignatures of a transition in the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless ($BKT$)\nuniversality class. Studying the internal border of zeros in the complex\ntemperature plane, we found a scenario in complete agreement with theoretical\nexpectations which allow one to uniquely classify a phase transition as in the\n$BKT$ class of universality. We obtain $T_{BKT}$ in excellent accordance with\nprevious results. A careful analysis of the behavior of the zeros for both\nregions $\\mathfrak{Re}(T) \\leq T_{BKT}$ and $\\mathfrak{Re}(T) > T_{BKT}$ in the\nthermodynamic limit show that $\\mathfrak{Im}(T)$ goes to zero in the former\ncase and is finite in the last one.\n", "  As the precious resource for quantum information processing, quantum\ncoherence can be created remotely if the involved two sites are quantum\ncorrelated. It can be expected that the amount of coherence created should\ndepend on the quantity of the shared quantum correlation, which is also a\nresource. Here, we establish an operational connection between coherence\ninduced by steering and the quantum correlation. We find that the\nsteering-induced coherence quantified by such as relative entropy of coherence\nand trace-norm of coherence is bounded from above by a known quantum\ncorrelation measure defined as the one-side measurement-induced disturbance.\nThe condition that the upper bound saturated by the induced coherence varies\nfor different measures of coherence. The tripartite scenario is also studied\nand similar conclusion can be obtained. Our results provide the operational\nconnections between local and non-local resources in quantum information\nprocessing.\n", "  A tidal radius is a distance from a satellite orbiting in a host potential\nbeyond which its material is stripped by the tidal force. We derive a revised\nexpression for the tidal radius of a rotating satellite which properly takes\ninto account the possibility of prograde and retrograde orbits of stars.\nBesides the eccentricity of the satellite orbit, the tidal radius depends also\non the ratio of the satellite internal angular velocity to the orbital angular\nvelocity. We compare our formula to the results of two $N$-body simulations of\ndwarf galaxies orbiting a Milky Way-like host on a prograde and retrograde\norbit. The tidal radius for the retrograde case is larger than for the\nprograde. We introduce a kinematic radius separating stars still orbiting the\ndwarf galaxy from those already stripped and following the potential of the\nhost galaxy. We find that the tidal radius matches very well the kinematic\nradius. Our results provide a connection between the formalism of the tidal\nradius derivation and the theory of resonant stripping.\n", "  We calculate the change of the properties of a resonator, when coupled to a\nsemiclassical spin by means of the magnetic field. Starting with the Lagrangian\nof the complete system, we provide an analytical expression for the linear\nresponse function for the motion of the resonator, thereby considering the\ninfluence of the resonator on the spin and vice versa. This analysis shows that\nthe resonance frequency and effective dissipation factor can change\nsignificantly due to the relaxation times of the spin. We first derive this for\na system consisting of a spin and mechanical resonator and thereafter apply the\nsame calculations to an electromagnetic resonator. Moreover, the applicability\nof the method is generalized to a resonator coupled to general two and more\nlevel systems, providing a key to understand some of the problems of two level\nsystems in quantum devices.\n", "  This work presents exchange potentials for specific orbitals calculated by\ninverting Hartree-Fock wavefunctions. This was achieved by using a Depurated\nInversion Method. The basic idea of the method relies upon the substitution of\nHartree-Fock orbitals and eigenvalues into the Kohn-Sham equation. Through\ninversion, the corresponding effective potentials were obtained. Further\ntreatment of the inverted potential should be carried on. The depuration is a\ncareful optimization which eliminates the poles and also ensures the\nfullfilment of the appropriate boundary conditions. The procedure developed\nhere is not restricted to the ground state or to a nodeless orbital and is\napplicable to all kinds of atoms. As an example, exchange potentials for noble\ngases and term-dependent orbitals of the lower configuration of Nitrogen are\ncalculated. The method allows to reproduce the input energies and wavefunctions\nwith a remarkable degree of accuracy.\n", "  We use trapped atomic ions forming a hybrid Coulomb crystal, and exploit its\nphonons to study an isolated quantum system composed of a single spin coupled\nto an engineered bosonic environment. We increase the complexity of the system\nby adding ions and controlling coherent couplings and, thereby, we observe the\nemergence of thermalization: Time averages of spin observables approach\nmicrocanonical averages while related fluctuations decay. Our platform features\nprecise control of system size, coupling strength, and isolation from the\nexternal world to explore the dynamics of equilibration and thermalization.\n", "  Effort has been given for the development of an analytical approach that\nhelps to address several sigmoidal and non-sigmoidal growth processes found in\nliterature. In the proposed approach, the role of specific growth rate in\ndifferent growth processes has been considered in an unified manner. It is\nfound that the different growth equations can be derived from the same\nfunctional form of rate equation of specific growth rate. A common functional\nform of growth and growth velocity have been derived analytically and it has\nbeen shown that different values of the parameters involved in the description\nlead to different growth function. The theta logistic growth can be explained\nin this proposed framework. It is found that the competitive environment may\nincrease the saturation level of population size.\n", "  Effective gravitational field equations on a four dimensional brane embedded\nin a five dimensional bulk have been considered. Using the Einstein-Hilbert\naction along with the Gauss-Bonnet correction term, we have derived static\nspherically symmetric vacuum solution to the effective field equations, first\norder in the Gauss-Bonnet coupling parameter. The solution so obtained, has one\npart corresponding to general relativity with an additional correction term,\nproportional to the Gauss-Bonnet coupling parameter. The correction term\nmodifies the spacetime structure, in particular, the location of the event\nhorizon. Proceeding further, we have derived effective field equations for\n$f(R)$ gravity with Gauss-Bonnet correction term and a static spherically\nsymmetric solution has been obtained. In this case the Gauss-Bonnet term\nmodifies both the event and cosmological horizon of the spacetime. There exist\nanother way of obtaining the brane metric --- expanding the bulk gravitational\nfield equations in the ratio of bulk to brane curvature scale and assuming a\nseparable bulk metric ansatz. It turns out that static, spherically symmetric\nsolutions obtained from this perturbative method can be matched exactly, with\nthe solutions derived earlier. This will hold for Einstein-Hilbert plus\nGauss-Bonnet as well as for f(R) with the Gauss-Bonnet correction. Implications\nof these results are discussed.\n", "  We study certain six dimensional theories arising on $(p,q)$ brane webs\nliving on $\\mathbb{R}\\times S^1$. These brane webs are dual to toric\nelliptically fibered Calabi-Yau threefolds. The compactification of the space\non which the brane web lives leads to a deformation of the partition functions\nequivalent to the elliptic deformation of the Ding-Iohara algebra. We compute\nthe elliptic version Dotsenko-Fateev integrals and show that they reproduce the\ninstanton counting of the six dimensional theory.\n", "  In this paper we study the relations of Planck-Einstein-de Broglie type for\nthe wave packets. We assume that the wave packet is a possible model of\nparticle . When studying the behaviour of the wave packet for standing waves,\nin relation to an accelerated observer (i.e. Rindler observer), there can be\ndemonstrated that the equivalent mass of the packet is the inertial mass. In\nour scenario, the waves and of the wave packets are depicted by the strain\ninduced/produced in the medium. The properties of the waves, of the wave packet\nand, generally, of the perturbations in a material medium suggest the existence\nof an acoustic world. The acoustic world has mechanical and thermodynamical\nproperties. The perturbations that are generated and propagated in the medium\nare correlated by means of acoustic waves with maximum speed. The observers of\nthis world of disturbances (namely the acoustic world) have senses that are\nbased on the perception of mechanical waves (disturbance of any kind) and\napparatus for detecting and acquiring information by means of the same type of\nwave. Time and length measurements (and other parameters) are correlated by\nLorentz type transformations, where the maximum speed is the speed of the sound\nwaves. By applying these transformations to the packet of standing waves, there\nresults that the energy, mass, linear momentum and the action variable/variable\naction undergo relativistic changes. We highlight the fact that the dynamic\nrelativist relationship between energy and momentum is a consequence of the\nwave packet model for a particle. We have also emphasized the existence of\ncertain limits for the energy of the disturbance and the corresponding action\nvariable.\n", "  Colorado State University (CSU) and Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory\n(Fermilab) have been developing a control system to regulate the resonant\nfrequency of an RF electron gun. As part of this effort, we present initial\ntest results for a benchmark temperature controller that combines a machine\nlearning-based model and a predictive control algorithm. This is part of an\non-going effort to develop adaptive, machine learning-based tools specifically\nto address control challenges found in particle accelerator systems.\n", "  Grand-canonical fluctuations of Bose-Einstein condensates of light are\naccessible to state-of-the-art experiments [J. Schmitt et al., Phys. Rev. Lett.\n112, 030401 (2014).]. We phenomenologically describe these fluctuations by\nusing the grand-canonical ensemble for a weakly interacting Bose gas at thermal\nequilibrium. For a two-dimensional harmonic trap, we use two models for which\nthe canonical partition functions of the weakly interacting Bose gas are given\nby exact recurrence relations. We find that the grand-canonical condensate\nfluctuations for weakly interacting Bose gases vanish at zero temperature, thus\nbehaving qualitatively similar to an ideal gas in the canonical ensemble (or\nmicro-canonical ensemble) rather than the grand-canonical ensemble. For low but\nfinite temperatures, the fluctuations remain considerably higher than for the\ncanonical ensemble, as predicted by the ideal gas in the grand-canonical\nensemble, thus clearly showing that we are not in a regime in which the\nensembles are equivalent.\n", "  We present a conditionally exactly solvable singular potential for the\none-dimensional Schr\\\"odinger equation which involves the exactly solvable\ninverse square root potential. Each of the two fundamental solutions that\ncompose the general solution of the problem is given by a linear combination\nwith non-constant coefficients of two confluent hypergeometric functions.\nDiscussing the bound-state wave functions vanishing both at infinity and in the\norigin, we derive the exact equation for the energy spectrum which is written\nusing two Hermite functions of non-integer order. In specific auxiliary\nvariables this equation becomes a mathematical equation that does not refer to\na specific physical context discussed. In the two-dimensional space of these\nauxiliary variables the roots of this equation draw a countable infinite set of\nopen curves with hyperbolic asymptotes. We present an analytic description of\nthese curves by a transcendental algebraic equation for the involved variables.\nThe intersections of the curves thus constructed with a certain cubic curve\nprovide a highly accurate description of the energy spectrum.\n", "  We report on the state of the art of quantum walk experiments with neutral\natoms in state-dependent optical lattices. We demonstrate a novel\nstate-dependent transport technique enabling the control of two spin-selective\nsublattices in a fully independent fashion. This transport technique allowed us\nto carry out a test of single-particle quantum interference based on the\nviolation of the Leggett-Garg inequality and, more recently, to probe\ntwo-particle quantum interference effects with neutral atoms cooled into the\nmotional ground state. These experiments lay the groundwork for the study of\ndiscrete-time quantum walks of strongly interacting, indistinguishable\nparticles to demonstrate quantum cellular automata of neutral atoms.\n", "  In this paper we analyze in detail a rarely discussed question of gravity\nwave production from evaporating primordial black holes. These black holes emit\ngravitons which are, at classical level, registered as gravity waves. We use\nthe latest constraints on their abundance, and calculate the power emitted in\ngravitons at the time of their evaporation. We then solve the coupled system of\nequations that gives us the evolution of the frequency and amplitude of gravity\nwaves during the expansion of the universe. The spectrum of gravitational waves\nthat can be detected today depends on multiple factors: fraction of the total\nenergy density which was occupied by primordial black holes, the epoch in which\nthey were formed, and quantities like their mass and angular momentum. We\nconclude that very small primordial black holes which evaporate before the\nbig-bang nucleosynthesis emit gravitons whose spectral energy fraction today\ncan be as large as $10^{-7.5}$. On the other hand, those which are massive\nenough so that they still exist now can yield a signal as high as $10^{-6.5}$.\nHowever, typical frequencies of the gravity waves from primordial black holes\nare still too high to be observed with the current and near future gravity wave\nobservations.\n", "  We compute the heat kernel for the Laplacians of symmetric transverse\ntraceless fields of arbitrary spin on the $AdS$ background in even number of\ndimensions using the group theoretic approach introduced in\n\\cite{Gopakumar:2011qs} and apply it on the partition function of six\ndimensional conformal gravity. The obtained partition function consists of the\nEinstein gravity, conformal ghost and two modes that contain mass.\n", "  If Dark Matter is made of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) with\nmasses below $\\sim$20 GeV, the corresponding nuclear recoils in mainstream WIMP\nexperiments are of energies too close, or below, the experimental threshold.\nGas Time Projection Chambers (TPCs) can be operated with a variety of target\nelements, offer good tracking capabilities and, on account of the amplification\nin gas, very low thresholds are achievable. Recent advances in electronics and\nin novel radiopure TPC readouts, especially micro-mesh gas structure\n(Micromegas), are improving the scalability and low-background prospects of\ngaseous TPCs. Here we present TREX-DM, a prototype to test the concept of a\nMicromegas-based TPC to search for low-mass WIMPs. The detector is designed to\nhost an active mass of $\\sim$0.300 kg of Ar at 10 bar, or alternatively\n$\\sim$0.160 kg of Ne at 10 bar, with an energy threshold below 0.4 keVee, and\nis fully built with radiopure materials. We will describe the detector in\ndetail, the results from the commissioning phase on surface, as well as a\npreliminary background model. The anticipated sensitivity of this technique may\ngo beyond current experimental limits for WIMPs of masses of 2-8 GeV.\n", "  Cosmological inflation generates primordial density perturbations on all\nscales, including those far too small to contribute to the cosmic microwave\nbackground. At these scales, isolated ultracompact minihalos of dark matter can\nform well before standard structure formation, if the perturbations have\nsufficient amplitude. Minihalos affect pulsar timing data and are potentially\nbright sources of gamma rays. The resulting constraints significantly extend\nthe observable window of inflation in the presence of cold dark matter,\ncoupling two of the key problems in modern cosmology.\n", "  The aim of the present work is to specify the spatio-temporal characteristics\nof flare activity observed by the Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic\nImager (RHESSI) and Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES)\nsatellites in connection with the behaviour of the longitudinal domain of\nenhanced sunspot activity known as active longitude (AL). By using our method\ndeveloped for this purpose, we identified the AL in every Carrington Rotation\nprovided by the Debrecen Photoheliographic Data (DPD). The spatial probability\nof flare occurrence has been estimated depending on the longitudinal distance\nfrom AL in the northern and southern hemispheres separately. We have found that\nmore than the 60\\% of the RHESSI and GOES flares is located within $\\pm\n36^{\\circ}$ from the active longitude. Hence, the most flare-productive active\nregions tend to be located in or close to the active longitudinal belt. This\nobserved feature may allow predicting the geo-effective position of the domain\nof enhanced flaring probability. Furthermore, we studied the temporal\nproperties of flare occurrence near the active longitude and several\nsignificant fluctuations were found. More precisely, the results of the method\nare the following fluctuations: $0.8$ years, $1.3$ years and $1.8$ years. These\ntemporal and spatial properties of the solar flare occurrence within the active\nlongitudinal belts could provide us enhanced solar flare forecasting\nopportunity.\n", "  We point out that the determinant formula for a parabolic Verma module plays\na key role in the study of (super)conformal field theories and in particular\ntheir (super)conformal blocks. The determinant formula is known from the old\nwork of Jantzen for bosonic conformal algebras, and we present a conjecture for\nsuperconformal algebras. The application of the formula includes derivation of\nthe unitary bound and recursion relations for conformal blocks.\n", "  We present a method for calculating the energy levels of superconducting\ncircuits that contain highly anharmonic, inductively-shunted modes with\narbitrarily strong coupling. Our method starts by calculating the normal modes\nof the linearized circuit and proceeds with numerical diagonalization in this\nbasis. As an example, we analyze the Hamiltonian of a fluxonium qubit\ninductively coupled to a readout resonator. While elementary, this simple\nexample is nontrivial because it cannot be efficiently treated by the method\nknown as \"black-box quantization,\" numerical diagonalization in the bare\nharmonic oscillator basis, or perturbation theory. Calculated spectra are\ncompared to measured spectroscopy data, demonstrating excellent quantitative\nagreement between theory and experiment.\n", "  Classification of relativistic wave equations is given on the ground of\ninterlocking representations of the Lorentz group. A system of interlocking\nrepresentations is associated with a system of eigenvector subspaces of the\nenergy operator. Such a correspondence allows one to define matter spectrum,\nwhere the each level of this spectrum presents a some state of elementary\nparticle. An elementary particle is understood as a superposition of state\nvectors in nonseparable Hilbert space. Classification of indecomposable systems\nof relativistic wave equations is produced for bosonic and fermionic fields on\nan equal footing (including Dirac and Maxwell equations). All these fields are\nequivalent levels of matter spectrum, which differ from each other by the value\nof mass and spin. It is shown that a spectrum of the energy operator,\ncorresponding to a given matter level, is non-degenerate for the fields of type\n$(l,0)\\oplus(0,l)$, where $l$ is a spin value, whereas for arbitrary spin\nchains we have degenerate spectrum. Energy spectra of the stability levels\n(electron and proton states) of the matter spectrum are studied in detail. It\nis shown that these stability levels have a nature of threshold scales of the\nfractal structure associated with the system of interlocking representations of\nthe Lorentz group.\n", "  Measurement of Bose-Einstein or HBT correlations of identified charged\nparticles provide insight into the space-time structure of particle emitting\nsources in heavy-ion collisions. In this paper we present the latest results\nfrom the RHIC PHENIX experiment on such measurements.\n", "  Coherent dressing of a quantum two-level system provides access to a new\nquantum system with improved properties - a different and easily tuneable level\nsplitting, faster control, and longer coherence times. In our work we\ninvestigate the properties of the dressed, donor-bound electron spin in\nsilicon, and probe its potential for the use as quantum bit in scalable\narchitectures. The two dressed spin-polariton levels constitute a quantum bit\nthat can be coherently driven with an oscillating magnetic field, an\noscillating electric field, by frequency modulating the driving field, or by a\nsimple detuning pulse. We measure coherence times of $T_{2\\rho}^*=2.4$ ms and\n$T_{2\\rho}^{\\rm Hahn}=9$ ms, one order of magnitude longer than those of the\nundressed qubit. Furthermore, the use of the dressed states enables coherent\ncoupling of the solid-state spins to electric fields and mechanical\noscillations.\n", "  We have studied the magnetic excitations of electron-doped\nSr$_{2-x}$La$_x$IrO$_4$ ($0 \\leq x \\leq 0.10$) using resonant inelastic x-ray\nscattering (RIXS) at the Ir L$_3$-edge. The long range magnetic order is\nrapidly lost with increasing $x$, but two-dimensional short-range order (SRO)\nand dispersive magnon excitations with nearly undiminished spectral weight\npersist well into the metallic part of the phase diagram. The magnons in the\nSRO phase are heavily damped and exhibit anisotropic softening. Their\ndispersions are well described by a pseudospin-1/2 Heisenberg model with\nexchange interactions whose spatial range increases with doping. We also find a\ndoping-independent high-energy magnetic continuum, which is not described by\nthis model. The spin-orbit excitons arising from the pseudospin-3/2 manifold of\nthe Ir ions broaden substantially in the SRO phase, but remain largely\nseparated from the low-energy magnons. Pseudospin-1/2 models are therefore a\ngood starting point for the theoretical description of the low-energy magnetic\ndynamics of doped iridates.\n", "  We observe the polarization squeezing in the mixture of a two mode squeezed\nvacuum and a simple coherent light through a linear polarization beam splitter.\nSqueezed vacuum not being squeezed in polarization, generates polarization\nsqueezed light when superposed with coherent light. All the three Stokes\nparameters of the light produced on the output port of polarization beam\nsplitter are found to be squeezed and squeezing factor also depends upon the\nparameters of coherent light.\n", "  We study polarization squeezing of a pure photon number state which is\nobviously polarized but the mere change in the basis of polarization leads to\nsimultaneous polarization squeezing in all the components of Stokes operator\nvector except those falling along or perpendicular to the direction of\npolarization state, is observed. We use the most general definition of\npolarization squeezing and discuss the experimental feasibility of the result.\nWe also observe that a squeezing operation like non-degenerate parametric\namplification of the state does not reveal simultaneous squeezing in all Stokes\noperator vectors and decreases in this sense.\n", "  We present a molecular dynamics study of the effects of carbon- and iron-ion\ninduced shock waves in DNA duplexes in liquid water. We use the CHARMM force\nfield implemented within the MBN Explorer simulation package to optimize and\nequilibrate DNA duplexes in liquid water boxes of different sizes and shapes.\nThe translational and vibrational degrees of freedom of water molecules are\nexcited according to the energy deposited by the ions and the subsequent shock\nwaves in liquid water are simulated. The pressure waves generated are studied\nand compared with an analytical hydrodynamics model which serves as a benchmark\nfor evaluating the suitability of the simulation boxes. The energy deposition\nin the DNA backbone bonds is also monitored as an estimation of biological\ndamage, something which lies beyond the possibilities of the analytical model.\n", "  We propose a generic scenario for realizing gapful topological\nsuperconductors (TSCs) from gapless spin-singlet superconductors (SCs).\nNoncentrosymmetric nodal SCs in two dimension are shown to be gapful under a\nZeeman field, as a result of the cooperation of inversion-symmetry breaking and\ntime-reversal-symmetry breaking. In particular, non-s-wave SCs acquire a large\nexcitation gap. Such paramagnetically-induced gapful SCs may be classified into\nTSCs in the symmetry class D specified by the Chern number. We show nontrivial\nChern numbers over a wide parameter range for spin-singlet SCs. A variety of\nthe paramagnetically-induced gapful TSCs are demonstrated, including D+p-wave\nTSC, extended S+p-wave TSC, p+D+f-wave TSC, and s+P-wave TSC. Natural extension\ntoward three-dimensional Weyl SCs is also discussed.\n", "  To describe the transverse momentum spectrum of heavy color-singlet\nproduction, the joint resummation of threshold and transverse momentum\nlogarithms is investigated. We obtain factorization theorems for various\nkinematic regimes valid to all orders in the strong coupling, using\nSoft-Collinear Effective Theory. We discuss how these enable resummation and\nhow to combine regimes. The new ingredients in the factorization theorems are\ncalculated at next-to-leading order, and a range of consistency checks is\nperformed. Our framework goes beyond the current next-to-leading logarithmic\naccuracy (NLL).\n", "  We investigate the low-lying excitation spectrum and ground-state properties\nof narrow graphene nanoribbons with zigzag edge configurations. Nanoribbons of\ncomparable widths have been synthesized very recently [P. Ruffieux, \\emph{et\nal.} Nature \\textbf{531}, 489 (2016)], and their descriptions require more\nsophisticated methods since in this regime conventional methods, like\nmean-field or density-functional theory with local density approximation, fail\nto capture the enhanced quantum fluctuations. Using the unbiased density-matrix\nrenormalization group algorithm we calculate the charge gaps with high accuracy\nfor different widths and interaction strengths and compare them with mean-field\nresults. It turns out that the gaps are much smaller in the former case due to\nthe proper treatment of quantum fluctuations. Applying the elements of quantum\ninformation theory we also reveal the entanglement structure inside a ribbon\nand examine the spectrum of subsystem density matrices to understand the origin\nof entanglement. We examine the possibility of magnetic ordering and the effect\nof magnetic field. Our findings are relevant for understanding the gap values\nin different recent experiments and the deviations between them.\n", "  We study the spin-$1/2$ Ising chain with multispin interactions $K$ involving\nthe product of $m$ successive spins, for general values of $m$. Using a change\nof spin variables the zero-field partition function of a finite chain is\nobtained for free and periodic boundary conditions (BC) and we calculate the\ntwo-spin correlation function. When placed in an external field $H$ the system\nis shown to be self-dual. Using another change of spin variables the\none-dimensional (1D) Ising model with multispin interactions in a field is\nmapped onto a zero-field rectangular Ising model with first-neighbour\ninteractions $K$ and $H$. The 2D system, with size $m\\times N/m$, has the\ntopology of a cylinder with helical BC. In the thermodynamic limit\n$N/m\\to\\infty$, $m\\to\\infty$, a 2D critical singularity develops on the\nself-duality line, $\\sinh 2K\\sinh 2H=1$.\n", "  We provide an alternative approach to relativistic dynamics based on the\nFeshbach projection technique. Instead of directly studying the Dirac equation,\nwe derive a two-component equation for the upper spinor. This approach allows\none to investigate the underlying physics in a different perspective. For\nparticles with small mass such as the neutrino, the leading order equation has\na Hermitian effective Hamiltonian, implying there is no leakage between the\nupper and lower spinors. In the weak relativistic regime, the leading order\ncorresponds to a non-Hermitian correction to the Pauli equation, which takes\ninto account the non-zero possibility of finding the lower-spinor state and\noffers a more precise description.\n", "  The splitting processes of bremsstrahlung and pair production in a medium are\ncoherent over large distances in the very high energy limit, which leads to a\nsuppression known as the Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal (LPM) effect. In this paper,\nwe continue analysis of the case when the coherence lengths of two consecutive\nsplitting processes overlap (which is important for understanding corrections\nto standard treatments of the LPM effect in QCD), avoiding soft-gluon\napproximations. In particular, this paper analyzes the subtle problem of how to\nprecisely separate overlapping double splitting (e.g.\\ overlapping double\nbremsstrahlung) from the case of consecutive, independent bremsstrahlung (which\nis the case that would be implemented in a Monte Carlo simulation based solely\non single splitting rates). As an example of the method, we consider the rate\nof real double gluon bremsstrahlung from an initial gluon with various\nsimplifying assumptions (thick media; $\\hat q$ approximation; large $N_c$; and\nneglect for the moment of processes involving 4-gluon vertices) and explicitly\ncompute the correction $\\Delta\\,d\\Gamma/dx\\,dy$ due to overlapping formation\ntimes.\n", "  Orbits are the key building blocks of any density distribution and their\nstudy helps us understand the kinematical structure and the evolution of\ngalaxies. Here we investigate orbits in a tidally induced bar of a dwarf\ngalaxy, using an $N$-body simulation of an initially disky dwarf galaxy\norbiting a Milky Way-like host. After the first pericenter passage, a tidally\ninduced bar forms in the stellar component of the dwarf. The bar evolution is\ndifferent than in isolated galaxies and our analysis focuses on the period\nbefore it buckles. We study the orbits in terms of their dominant frequencies,\nwhich we calculate in a Cartesian coordinate frame rotating with the bar. Apart\nfrom the well-known x$_1$ orbits we find many other types, mostly with boxy\nshapes of various degree of elongation. Some of them are also near-periodic,\nadmitting frequency ratios of 4/3, 3/2 and 5/3. The box orbits have various\ndegrees of vertical thickness but only a relatively small fraction of those\nhave banana (i.e. smile/frown) or infinity-symbol shapes in the edge-on view.\nIn the very center we also find orbits known from the potential of triaxial\nellipsoids. The elongation of the orbits grows with distance from the center of\nthe bar in agreement with the variation of the shape of the density\ndistribution. Our classification of orbits leads to the conclusion that more\nthan $80 \\%$ of them have boxy shapes, while only $8 \\%$ have shapes of\nclassical x$_1$ orbits.\n", "  State of the art qubit systems are reaching the gate fidelities required for\nscalable quantum computation architectures. Further improvements in the\nfidelity of quantum gates demands characterization and benchmarking protocols\nthat are efficient, reliable and extremely accurate. Ideally, a benchmarking\nprotocol should also provide information on how to rectify residual errors.\nGate Set Tomography (GST) is one such protocol designed to give detailed\ncharacterization of as-built qubits. We implemented GST on a high-fidelity\nelectron-spin qubit confined by a single $^{31}$P atom in $^{28}$Si. The\nresults reveal systematic errors that a randomized benchmarking analysis could\nmeasure but not identify, whereas GST indicated the need for improved\ncalibration of the length of the control pulses. After introducing this\nmodification, we measured a new benchmark average gate fidelity of\n$99.942(8)\\%$, an improvement on the previous value of $99.90(2)\\%$.\nFurthermore, GST revealed high levels of non-Markovian noise in the system,\nwhich will need to be understood and addressed when the qubit is used within a\nfault-tolerant quantum computation scheme.\n", "  The ground-state properties of a few spin-1/2 fermions with different masses\nand interacting via short-range contact forces are studied within an exact\ndiagonalization approach. It is shown that, depending on the shape of the\nexternal confinement, different scenarios of the spatial separation between\ncomponents manifested by specific shapes of the density profiles can be\nobtained in the strong interaction limit. We find that the ground-state of the\nsystem undergoes a specific transition between orderings when the confinement\nis changed adiabatically from a uniform box to a harmonic oscillator shape. We\nstudy the properties of this transition in the framework of the finite-size\nscaling method adopted to few-body systems.\n", "  Scanning nanofocus X-ray diffraction (nXRD) performed at a synchrotron is\nused for the first time to simultaneously probe the morphology and the\nstructural properties of spin-coated CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPI) perovskite films for\nphotovoltaic devices. MAPI films are spin-coated on a Si/SiO2/PEDOT:PSS\nsubstrate held at different temperatures during the deposition in order to tune\nthe perovskite film coverage, and then investigated by nXRD, scanning electron\nmicroscopy (SEM) and grazing incidence wide angle X-ray scatter-ing (GI-WAXS).\nThe advantages of nXRD over SEM and GI-WAXS are dis-cussed. A method to\nvisualize, selectively isolate, and structurally charac-terize single\nperovskite grains buried within a complex, polycrystalline film is developed.\nThe results of nXRD measurements are correlated with solar cell device\nmeasurements, and it is shown that spin-coating the perovskite precursor\nsolution at elevated temperatures leads to improved surface coverage and\nenhanced solar cell performance.\n", "  Symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases in free fermion and interacting\nbosonic systems have been classified, but the physical phenomena of interacting\nfermionic SPT phases have not been fully explored. Here, employing large-scale\nquantum Monte Carlo simulation, we investigate the edge physics of a bilayer\nKane-Mele-Hubbard model with zigzag ribbon geometry. Our unbiased numerical\nresults show that the fermion edge modes are gapped out by interaction, while\nthe bosonic edge modes remain gapless at the $(1+1)d$ boundary, before the bulk\nquantum phase transition to a topologically trivial phase. Therefore, finite\nfermion gaps both in the bulk and on the edge, together with the robust gapless\nbosonic edge modes, prove that our system becomes an emergent bosonic SPT phase\nat low energy, which is, for the first time, directly observed in an\ninteracting fermion lattice model.\n", "  We study electron-positron pair creation by a strong and slowly varying\nelectric field, assisted by a weaker and more rapidly changing field (e.g., in\nthe keV regime) plus an additional high-energy (say MeV) photon. It turns out\nthat this combination can yield a pair creation probability which is\nexponentially larger than in the case where one (or more) of the three\ningredients is missing. Apart from a deeper understanding of these\nnon-perturbative phenomena, this double enhancement may pave the way for an\nexperimental verification of this fundamental prediction.\n", "  We consider the nature of quantum properties in non-relativistic quantum\nmechanics (QM) and relativistic QFTs, and examine the connection between formal\nquantization schemes and intuitive notions of wave-particle duality. Based on\nthe map between classical Poisson brackets and their associated commutators,\nsuch schemes give rise to quantum states obeying canonical dispersion\nrelations, obtained by substituting the de Broglie relations into the relevant\n(classical) energy-momentum relation. In canonical QM, this yields a dispersion\nrelation involving $\\hbar$ but not $c$, whereas the canonical relativistic\ndispersion relation involves both. Extending this logic to the canonical\nquantization of the gravitational field gives rise to loop quantum gravity, and\na map between classical variables containing $G$ and $c$, and associated\ncommutators involving $\\hbar$. This naturally defines a \"wave-gravity duality\",\nsuggesting that a quantum wave packet describing {\\it self-gravitating matter}\nobeys a dispersion relation involving $G$, $c$ and $\\hbar$. We propose an\nansatz for this relation, which is valid in the semi-Newtonian regime of both\nQM and general relativity. In this limit, space and time are absolute, but\nimposing $v_{\\rm max} = c$ allows us to recover the standard expressions for\nthe Compton wavelength $\\lambda_C$ and the Schwarzschild radius $r_S$ within\nthe same ontological framework. The new dispersion relation is based on\n\"extended\" de Broglie relations, which remain valid for slow-moving bodies of\n{\\it any} mass $m$. These reduce to canonical form for $m \\ll m_P$, yielding\n$\\lambda_C$ from the standard uncertainty principle, whereas, for $m \\gg m_P$,\nwe obtain $r_S$ as the natural radius of a self-gravitating quantum object.\nThus, the extended de Broglie theory naturally gives rise to a unified\ndescription of black holes and fundamental particles in the semi-Newtonian\nregime.\n", "  The neutron spin resonance is a collective magnetic excitation that appears\nin copper oxide, iron pnictide, and heavy fermion unconventional\nsuperconductors. Although the resonance is commonly associated with a\nspin-exciton due to the $d$($s^{\\pm}$)-wave symmetry of the superconducting\norder parameter, it has also been proposed to be a magnon-like excitation\nappearing in the superconducting state. Here we use inelastic neutron\nscattering to demonstrate that the resonance in the heavy fermion\nsuperconductor Ce$_{1-x}$Yb$_{x}$CoIn$_5$ with $x=0,0.05,0.3$ has a ring-like\nupward dispersion that is robust against Yb-doping. By comparing our\nexperimental data with random phase approximation calculation using the\nelectronic structure and the momentum dependence of the $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave\nsuperconducting gap determined from scanning tunneling microscopy for\nCeCoIn$_5$, we conclude the robust upward dispersing resonance mode in\nCe$_{1-x}$Yb$_{x}$CoIn$_5$ is inconsistent with the downward dispersion\npredicted within the spin-exciton scenario.\n", "  We perform a comprehensive cosmological study of the $H_0$ tension between\nthe direct local measurement and the model-dependent value inferred from the\nCosmic Microwave Background. With the recent measurement of $H_0$ this tension\nhas raised to more than $3\\sigma$. We consider changes in the early time\nphysics without modifying the late time cosmology. We also reconstruct the late\ntime expansion history in a model independent way with minimal assumptions\nusing distances measures from Baryon Acoustic Oscillations and Type Ia\nSupernovae, finding that at $z<0.6$ the recovered shape of the expansion\nhistory is less than 5 % different than that of a standard LCDM model. These\nprobes also provide a model insensitive constraint on the low-redshift standard\nruler, measuring directly the combination $r_s h$ where $H_0=h \\times 100$\nkm/s/Mpc and $r_s$ is the sound horizon at radiation drag (the standard ruler),\ntraditionally constrained by CMB observations. Thus $r_s$ and $H_0$ provide\nabsolute scales for distance measurements (anchors) at opposite ends of the\nobservable Universe. We calibrate the cosmic distance ladder and obtain a\nmodel-independent determination of the standard ruler for acoustic scale,\n$r_s$. The tension in $H_0$ reflects a mismatch between our determination of\n$r_s$ and its standard, CMB-inferred value. Without including high-l Planck CMB\npolarization data (i.e., only considering the \"recommended baseline\" low-l\npolarisation and temperature and the high l temperature data), a modification\nof the early-time physics to include a component of dark radiation with an\neffective number of species around 0.4 would reconcile the CMB-inferred\nconstraints, and the local $H_0$ and standard ruler determinations. The\ninclusion of the \"preliminary\" high-l Planck CMB polarisation data disfavours\nthis solution.\n", "  A search for neutrino and antineutrino events correlated with 2,350 gamma-ray\nbursts (GRBs) is performed with Borexino data collected between December 2007\nand November 2015. No statistically significant excess over background is\nobserved. We look for electron antineutrinos ($\\bar{\\nu}_e$) that inverse beta\ndecay on protons with energies from 1.8\\,MeV to 15\\,MeV and set the best limit\non the neutrino fluence from GRBs below 8\\,MeV. The signals from neutrinos and\nantineutrinos from GRBs that scatter on electrons are also searched for, a\ndetection channel made possible by the particularly radio-pure scintillator of\nBorexino. We obtain currently the best limits on the neutrino fluence of all\nflavors and species below 7\\,MeV. Finally, time correlations between GRBs and\nbursts of events are investigated. Our analysis combines two semi-independent\ndata acquisition systems for the first time: the primary Borexino readout\noptimized for solar neutrino physics up to a few MeV, and a fast waveform\ndigitizer system tuned for events above 1\\,MeV.\n", "  We discuss a minimal solution to the long-standing $(g-2)_\\mu$ anomaly in a\nsimple extension of the Standard Model with an extra $Z'$ vector boson that has\nonly flavor off-diagonal couplings to the second and third generation of\nleptons, i.e. $\\mu, \\tau, \\nu_\\mu, \\nu_\\tau$ and their antiparticles. A\nsimplified model realization, as well as various collider and low-energy\nconstraints on this model, are discussed. We find that the $(g-2)_\\mu$-favored\nregion for a $Z'$ lighter than the tau lepton is totally excluded, while a\nheavier $Z'$ solution is still allowed. Some testable implications of this\nscenario in future experiments, such as lepton-flavor universality-violating\ntau decays at Belle 2, and a new four-lepton signature involving same-sign\ndi-muons and di-taus at HL-LHC and FCC-ee, are pointed out. A characteristic\nresonant absorption feature in the high-energy neutrino spectrum might also be\nobserved by neutrino telescopes like IceCube and KM3NeT.\n", "  We study theoretically the responses of the dynamically corrected gates to\ntime-dependent noises in the exchange-only spin qubit system. We consider $1/f$\nnoises having spectra proportional to $1/\\omega^\\alpha$, where the exponent\n$\\alpha$ indicates the strength of correlation within the noise. The quantum\ngate errors due to noises are extracted from a numerical simulation of\nRandomized Benchmarking, and are compared between the application of\nuncorrected operations and that of dynamically corrected gates robust against\nthe hyperfine noise. We have found that for $\\alpha\\gtrsim1.5$, the dynamically\ncorrected gates offer considerable reduction in the gate error and such\nreduction is approximately two orders of magnitude for the experimentally\nrelevant noise exponent. On the other hand, no improvement of the gate fidelity\nis provided for $\\alpha\\lesssim1.5$. This critical value $\\alpha_c\\approx1.5$\nis comparatively larger than that for the cases for the singlet-triplet qubits.\nThe filter transfer functions corresponding to the dynamically corrected gates\nare also computed and compared to those derived from uncorrected pulses. Our\nresults suggest that the dynamically corrected gates are useful measures to\nsuppress the hyperfine noise when operating the exchange-only qubits.\n", "  In the present work, we show the importance of temperature dependent energy\nband gap, E$_{g}$(T), in understanding the high temperature thermoelectric (TE)\nproperties of material by considering LaCoO$_{3}$ (LCO) and ZnV$_{2}$O$_{4}$\n(ZVO) compounds as a case study. For the fix value of band gap, E$_{g}$,\ndeviation in the values of $\\alpha$ has been observed above 360 K and 400 K for\nLCO and ZVO compounds, respectively. These deviation can be overcomed by\nconsideration of temperature dependent band gap. The change in used value of\nE$_{g}$ with respect to temperature is $\\sim$4 times larger than that of InAs.\nThis large temperature dependence variation in E$_{g}$ can be attributed to\ndecrement in the effective on-site Coulomb interaction due to lattice\nexpansion. At 600 K, the value of \\textit{ZT} for \\textit{n} and\n\\textit{p-doped}, LCO is $\\sim$0.35 which suggest that it can be a used as a\npotential material for TE device. This work clearly suggest that one should\nconsider the temperature dependent band gap in predicting the high temperature\nTE properties of insulating materials.\n", "  New insights on stellar evolution and stellar interiors physics are being\nmade possible by asteroseismology. Throughout the course of the Kepler mission,\nasteroseismology has also played an important role in the characterization of\nexoplanet-host stars and their planetary systems. The upcoming NASA Transiting\nExoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) will be performing a near all-sky survey for\nplanets that transit bright nearby stars. In addition, its excellent\nphotometric precision, combined with its fine time sampling and long intervals\nof uninterrupted observations, will enable asteroseismology of solar-type and\nred-giant stars. Here we develop a simple test to estimate the detectability of\nsolar-like oscillations in TESS photometry of any given star. Based on an\nall-sky stellar and planetary synthetic population, we go on to predict the\nasteroseismic yield of the TESS mission, placing emphasis on the yield of\nexoplanet-host stars for which we expect to detect solar-like oscillations.\nThis is done for both the target stars (observed at a 2-min cadence) and the\nfull-frame-image stars (observed at a 30-min cadence). A similar exercise is\nalso conducted based on a compilation of known host stars. We predict that TESS\nwill detect solar-like oscillations in a few dozen target hosts (mainly\nsubgiant stars but also in a smaller number of F dwarfs), in up to 200\nlow-luminosity red-giant hosts, and in over 100 solar-type and red-giant known\nhosts, thereby leading to a threefold improvement in the asteroseismic yield of\nexoplanet-host stars when compared to Kepler's.\n", "  A measurement of the cross-section for $W \\to e\\nu$ production in $pp$\ncollisions is presented using data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of\n$2\\,$fb$^{-1}$ collected by the LHCb experiment at a centre-of-mass energy of\n$\\sqrt{s}=8\\,$TeV. The electrons are required to have more than $20\\,$GeV of\ntransverse momentum and to lie between 2.00 and 4.25 in pseudorapidity. The\ninclusive $W$ production cross-sections, where the $W$ decays to $e\\nu$, are\nmeasured to be \\begin{equation*} \\sigma_{W^{+} \\to e^{+}\\nu_{e}}=1124.4\\pm\n2.1\\pm 21.5\\pm 11.2\\pm 13.0\\,\\mathrm{pb}, \\end{equation*} \\begin{equation*}\n\\sigma_{W^{-} \\to e^{-}\\bar{\\nu}_{e}}=\\,\\,\\,809.0\\pm 1.9\\pm 18.1\\pm\\,\\,\\,7.0\\pm\n\\phantom{0}9.4\\,\\mathrm{pb}, \\end{equation*} where the first uncertainties are\nstatistical, the second are systematic, the third are due to the knowledge of\nthe LHC beam energy and the fourth are due to the luminosity determination.\nDifferential cross-sections as a function of the electron pseudorapidity are\nmeasured. The $W^{+}/W^{-}$ cross-section ratio and production charge asymmetry\nare also reported. Results are compared with theoretical predictions at\nnext-to-next-to-leading order in perturbative quantum chromodynamics. Finally,\nin a precise test of lepton universality, the ratio of $W$ boson branching\nfractions is determined to be \\begin{equation*} \\mathcal{B}(W \\to\ne\\nu)/\\mathcal{B}(W \\to \\mu\\nu)=1.020\\pm 0.002\\pm 0.019, \\end{equation*} where\nthe first uncertainty is statistical and the second is systematic.\n", "  Within the SM, the yet unmeasured $\\tau^-\\to\\pi^-\\eta^{(\\prime)}\\nu_\\tau$\ndecays are predicted as a suppressed, isospin-violating effect with branching\nratios $\\lesssim\\mathcal{O}(10^{-5})$. However, they can also proceed through\nother mechanisms (such as charged Higgs exchange) at comparable rates. This has\nmotivated several studies of the corresponding QCD predictions for these second\nclass current processes. In this contribution we discuss the prospects for the\ndiscovery of these decays at Belle-II emphasizing the Mexican involvement in\nthis project. Our branching ratio prediction $\\sim1.7\\cdot10^{-5}$ (decay\nchannel with an $\\eta$ meson) is well within the reach of Belle-II. The\nbranching fraction for the decay channel with an $\\eta^\\prime$ meson is\nexpected to be between one and two orders of magnitude more suppressed.\n", "  In the search for an accurate and computationally efficient approximation to\nthe exact exchange potential of Kohn-Sham density functional theory, we\nrecently compared various semilocal exchange potentials to the exact one [F.\nTran et al., Phys. Rev. B 91, 165121 (2015)]. It was concluded that the\nBecke-Johnson (BJ) potential is a very good starting point, but requires the\nuse of empirical parameters to obtain good agreement with the exact exchange\npotential. In the present work, we extend the comparison by considering the\nKrieger-Li-Iafrate (KLI) approximation, which is a beyond-semilocal\napproximation. It is shown that overall the KLI and BJ-based potentials are the\nmost reliable approximations to the exact exchange potential, however, sizeable\ndifferences, especially for the antiferromagnetic transition-metal oxides, can\nbe obtained.\n", "  A search for high-energy neutrino emission correlated with gamma-ray bursts\noutside the electromagnetic prompt-emission time window is presented. Using a\nstacking approach of the time delays between reported gamma-ray burst alerts\nand spatially coincident muon-neutrino signatures, data from the Antares\nneutrino telescope recorded between 2007 and 2012 are analysed. One year of\npublic data from the IceCube detector between 2008 and 2009 have been also\ninvestigated. The respective timing profiles are scanned for statistically\nsignificant accumulations within 40 days of the Gamma Ray Burst, as expected\nfrom Lorentz Invariance Violation effects and some astrophysical models. No\nsignificant excess over the expected accidental coincidence rate could be found\nin either of the two data sets. The average strength of the neutrino signal is\nfound to be fainter than one detectable neutrino signal per hundred gamma-ray\nbursts in the Antares data at 90% confidence level.\n", "  General relativity is the theory with unclear energy momentum tensor. An\napproach is considered, allowing to construct the energy momentum tensor for\nrelativity with nonsymmetric metric. A consequence of the approach is confirmed\nin the nuclear physics.\n", "  Stokes' theorem is central to many aspects of physics -- electromagnetism,\nthe Aharonov-Bohm effect, and Wilson loops to name a few. However, the\npedagogical examples and research work almost exclusively focus on situations\nwhere the fields are time-independent so that one need only deal with purely\nspatial line integrals ({\\it e.g.} $\\oint {\\bf A} \\cdot d{\\bf x}$) and purely\nspatial area integrals ({\\it e.g.} $\\int (\\nabla \\times {\\bf A}) \\cdot d{\\bf a}\n= \\int {\\bf B} \\cdot d{\\bf a}$). Here we address this gap by giving some\nexplicit examples of how Stokes' theorem plays out with time-dependent fields\nin a full 4-dimensional spacetime context. We also discuss some unusual\nfeatures of Stokes' theorem with time-dependent fields related to gauge\ntransformations and non-simply connected topology.\n", "  The Mg II h&k lines are powerful diagnostics for studying the solar\nchromosphere. They have become particularly popular with the launch of the IRIS\nsatellite, and a number of studies that include these lines have lead to great\nprogress in understanding chromospheric heating, in many cases thanks to the\nsupport from 3D MHD simulations. In this study we utilize another approach to\nanalyze observations: non-LTE inversions of the Mg II h&k and UV triplet lines\nincluding the effects of partial redistribution. Our inversion code attempts to\nconstruct a model atmosphere that is compatible with the observed spectra. We\nhave assessed the capabilities and limitations of the inversions using the FALC\natmosphere and a snapshot from a 3D radiation-MHD simulation. We find that Mg\nII h&k allow reconstructing a model atmosphere from the middle photosphere to\nthe transition region. We have also explored the capabilities of a\nmulti-line/multi-atom setup, including the Mg II h&k, the Ca II 854.2 nm and\nthe Fe I 630.25 lines to recover the full stratification of physical\nparameters, including the magnetic field vector, from the photosphere to the\nchromosphere. Finally, we present the first inversions of observed IRIS spectra\nfrom quiet-Sun, plage and sunspot, with very promising results.\n", "  The structure of even-even neutron-rich Ru, Mo, Zr and Sr nuclei in the\n$A\\approx 100$ mass region is studied within the interacting boson model (IBM)\nwith microscopic input from the self-consistent mean-field approximation based\non the Gogny-D1M energy density functional. The deformation energy surface in\nthe quadrupole deformation space $(\\beta,\\gamma)$, computed within the\nconstrained Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov framework, is mapped onto the expectation\nvalue of the appropriately chosen IBM Hamiltonian with configuration mixing in\nthe boson condensate state. The mapped IBM Hamiltonian is used to study the\nspectroscopic properties of $^{98-114}$Ru, $^{96-112}$Mo, $^{94-110}$Zr and\n$^{92-108}$Sr. Several cases of $\\gamma$-soft behavior are predicted in Ru and\nMo nuclei while a pronounced coexistence between strongly-prolate and\nweakly-oblate deformed shapes is found for Zr and Sr nuclei. The method\ndescribes well the evolution of experimental yrast and non-yrast states as well\nas selected $B$(E2) transition probabilities.\n", "  We present the results of a cross-correlation search for gravitational waves\nfrom SNR 1987A using the second year of LIGO Science Run 5 data. The frequency\nband 75--450\\,Hz is searched. No evidence of gravitational waves is found. A\n90\\% confidence upper limit of $h_0 \\leq 3.8\\times10^{-25}$ is placed on the\ngravitational wave strain at the most sensitive frequency near 150\\,Hz. This\ncorresponds to an ellipticity of $\\epsilon \\leq 8.2\\times10^{-4}$ and improves\non previously published strain upper limits by a factor $\\approx4$. We perform\na comprehensive suite of validations of the search algorithm and identify\nseveral computational savings which marginally sacrifice sensitivity in order\nto streamline the parameter space being searched. We estimate detection\nthresholds and sensitivities through Monte-Carlo simulations.\n", "  We present the first set of benchmark problems for phase field models that\nare being developed by the Center for Hierarchical Materials Design (CHiMaD)\nand the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). While many\nscientific research areas use a limited set of well-established software, the\ngrowing phase field community continues to develop a wide variety of codes and\nlacks benchmark problems to consistently evaluate the numerical performance of\nnew implementations. Phase field modeling has become significantly more popular\nas computational power has increased and is now becoming mainstream, driving\nthe need for benchmark problems to validate and verify new implementations. We\nfollow the example set by the micromagnetics community to develop an evolving\nset of benchmark problems that test the usability, computational resources,\nnumerical capabilities and physical scope of phase field simulation codes. In\nthis paper, we propose two benchmark problems that cover the physics of solute\ndiffusion and growth and coarsening of a second phase via a simple spinodal\ndecomposition model and a more complex Ostwald ripening model. We demonstrate\nthe utility of benchmark problems by comparing the results of simulations\nperformed with two different adaptive time stepping techniques, and we discuss\nthe needs of future benchmark problems. The development of benchmark problems\nwill enable the results of quantitative phase field models to be confidently\nincorporated into integrated computational materials science and engineering\n(ICME), an important goal of the Materials Genome Initiative.\n", "  Zhang have obtained recently a twisted rotating black hole metric, which is a\nvacuum solution in four-dimensional Einstein gravity. This black hole solution\nhas a rotation parameter, but without the total angular moment. Here, we have\ninvestigated the shadow casted by a twisted rotating black hole. Our results\nshow that the shape of the shadow of the twisted rotating black hole is a\nstandard round disk and does not depend on the inclination angle of the\nobserver. It means that although the twisted rotating black hole has a rotation\nparameter, its shadow possesses the same behaviors as the common static black\nhole rather than the usual Kerr-like black holes. Moreover, we find that the\nmarginally circular orbit radius of photon is independent of the direction of\nphoton around the black hole. The value of the marginally circular orbit radius\nof photon and the size of shadow increase monotonously with the rotation\nparameter.\n", "  The field of the globular cluster NGC 362 was monitored between 1997 and 2015\nin a search for variable stars. BV light curves were obtained for 151 periodic\nor likely periodic variables, over a hundred of which are new detections.\nTwelve newly detected variables are proper motion members of the cluster: two\nSX Phe and two RR Lyr pulsators, one contact binary, three detached or\nsemi-detached eclipsing binaries, and four spotted variables. The most\ninteresting objects among these are the binary blue straggler V20 with an\nasymmetric light curve, and the 8.1 d semidetached binary V24 located on the\nred giant branch of NGC 362, which is a Chandra X-ray source. We also provide\nsubstantial new data for 24 previously known variables.\n", "  Tunable quantum phase transitions and novel emergent fermions in solid state\nmaterials are fascinating subjects of research. Here, we propose a new stable\ntwo-dimensional (2D) material, the blue phosphorene oxide (BPO), which exhibits\nboth. Based on first-principles calculations, we show that its equilibrium\nstate is a narrow-bandgap semiconductor with three bands at low energy.\nRemarkably, a moderate strain can drive a semiconductor-to-semimetal quantum\nphase transition in BPO. At the critical transition point, the three bands\ncross at a single point at Fermi level, around which the quasiparticles are a\nnovel type of 2D pseudospin-1 fermions. Going beyond the transition, the system\nbecomes a symmetry-protected semimetal, for which the conduction and valence\nbands touch quadratically at a single Fermi point that is protected by\nsymmetry, and the low-energy quasiparticles become another novel type of 2D\ndouble Weyl fermions. We construct effective models characterizing the phase\ntransition and these novel emergent fermions, and we point out several exotic\neffects, including super Klein tunneling, supercollimation, and universal\noptical absorbance. Our result reveals BPO as an intriguing platform for the\nexploration of fundamental properties of quantum phase transitions and novel\nemergent fermions, and also suggests its great potential in nanoscale device\napplications.\n", "  Half Heusler (HH) thermoelectric alloys provide a wide platform to choose\nmaterials with non-toxic and earth abundant elements. This article presents an\nab-initio theoretical evaluation of electrical and thermal transport properties\nof three Bismuth-based most promising thermoelectric alloys, selected out of 54\nstable HH compounds. These are brand new compounds which are recently proposed\nto be stable (Nature Chem. 7, 308 (2015)) and may have interesting properties.\nThe calculated band structure of the three compounds, namely HfRhBi, ZrIrBi and\nZrRhBi, served as a hint for their promising thermoelectric properties. To gain\nconfidence on the theoretical predictions of these unreported systems, we first\nchecked our calculated results for a well studied similar compound, ZrNiSn, and\nshowed reasonable agreement with the measured ones. HfRhBi and ZrIrBi turn out\nto be narrow band gap while ZrRhBi is a moderate band gap semiconductor. A\ndetailed study of the carrier concentration and temperature dependance of the\nSeebeck coefficient (S), Power factor (S$^2 \\sigma$), lattice ($\\kappa_L$) and\nelectronic ($\\kappa_e$) thermal conductivity and hence the figure of merit (ZT)\nis carried out. In contrast to most promising known thermoelectric materials,\nwe found high power factor for these materials (highest S$^2 \\sigma\\sim$17.36\nmWm$^{-1}$K$^{-2}$ for p-type ZrIrBi). All the three systems (specially p-type)\nshow high figure of merit, with ZT value as high as 0.45 for ideal crystal.\nMaximum ZT and the corresponding optimal n- and p-type doping concentrations\n($n_c$) are calculated for all the three compounds, which shall certainly pave\nguidance to future experimental work.\n", "  Real-Space renormalization group techniques are developed for tackling large\ncurvature fluctuations in quantum gravity. Within cells of invariant volume\n$a^4$, only certain types of fluctuations are allowed. Normal coordinates are\nused to avoid redundancy of the degrees of freedom. The relevant integration\nmeasure is read off from the metric on metrics. All fluctuations in a group of\ncells are averaged over to get an effective action for the larger cell. In this\npaper the simplest type of fluctuations are kept. The measure is simply an\nintegration over independent components of the curvature tensor at the center\nof each cell. Terms of higher order in $a$ are required for convergence in case\nof Einstein-Hilbert action. With only next order (in $a$) contribution to the\naction, there is no renormalization of Newton's or cosmological constants. The\n`massless Gaussian surface' in the renormalization group space is given by\nactions that have linear and quadratic terms in curvature and determines the\nevolution of coupling constants away from it. Our techniques allow for\nsystematic improvements.\n", "  We describe some of the challenges of particle accelerator control, highlight\nrecent advances in neural network techniques, discuss some promising avenues\nfor incorporating neural networks into particle accelerator control systems,\nand describe a neural network-based control system that is being developed for\nresonance control of an RF electron gun at the Fermilab Accelerator Science and\nTechnology (FAST) facility, including initial experimental results from a\nbenchmark controller.\n", "  Recently, an ultra-low-cost linear scan based tomography architecture was\nproposed by our team. Similar to linear tomosynthesis, the source and detector\nare translated in opposite directions and the data acquisition system targets\non a region-of-interest (ROI) to acquire data for image reconstruction. This\nkind of tomography architecture was named parallel translational computed\ntomography (PTCT). In our previous studies, filtered backprojection (FBP)-type\nalgorithms were developed to reconstruct images from PTCT. However, the\nreconstructed ROI images from truncated projections have severe truncation\nartifacts. In this paper, we propose two backprojection filtering (BPF)-type\nalgorithms named MP-BPF and MZ-BPF to reconstruct ROI images from truncated\nPTCT data. A weight function is constructed to deal with data redundancy for\nmulti-linear translations modes. Extensive numerical simulations are performed\nto evaluate the proposed MP-BPF and MZ-BPF algorithms for PTCT in fan-beam\ngeometry. Qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that the proposed\nBPF-type algorithms can not only accurately reconstruct ROI images from\ntruncated projections but also provide high-quality images for the entire image\nsupport in some circumstances.\n", "  The size-modified Poisson-Boltzmann equation (SMPBE) is one important variant\nof the popular dielectric model, the Poisson-Boltzmann equation (PBE), to\nreflect ionic size effects in the prediction of electrostatics for a\nbiomolecule in an ionic solvent. In this paper, a new SMPBE hybrid solver is\ndeveloped using a solution decomposition, the Schwartz's overlapped domain\ndecomposition, finite element, and finite difference. It is then programmed as\na software package in C, Fortran, and Python based on the state-of-the-art\nfinite element library DOLFIN from the FEniCS project. This software package is\nwell validated on a Born ball model with analytical solution and a dipole model\nwith a known physical properties. Numerical results on six proteins with\ndifferent net charges demonstrate its high performance. Finally, this new SMPBE\nhybrid solver is shown to be numerically stable and convergent in the\ncalculation of electrostatic solvation free energy for 216 biomolecules and\nbinding free energy for a DNA-drug complex.\n", "  Measurement of the Galactic neutral atomic hydrogen (HI) column density, NHI,\nand brightness temperatures, Tb, is of high scientific value for a broad range\nof astrophysical disciplines. In the past two decades, one of the most-used\nlegacy HI datasets has been the Leiden/Argentine/Bonn Survey (LAB). We release\nthe HI 4$\\pi$ survey (HI4PI), an all-sky database of Galactic HI, which\nsupersedes the LAB survey. The HI4PI survey is based on data from the recently\ncompleted first coverage of the Effelsberg-Bonn HI Survey (EBHIS) and from the\nthird revision of the Galactic All-Sky Survey (GASS). EBHIS and GASS share\nsimilar angular resolution and match well in sensitivity. Combined, they are\nideally suited to be a successor to LAB. The new HI4PI survey outperforms the\nLAB in angular resolution (16.2', FWHM) and sensitivity (RMS: 43 mK). Moreover,\nit has full spatial sampling and thus overcomes a major drawback of LAB, which\nseverely undersamples the sky. We publish all-sky column density maps of the\nneutral atomic hydrogen in the Milky Way, along with full spectroscopic data,\nin several map projections including HEALPix.\n", "  We discuss the single diffractive production of $c \\bar c$ pairs and charmed\nmesons at the LHC. In addition to standard collinear approach, for a first time\nwe propose a $k_t$-factorization approach to the diffractive processes. The\ntransverse momentum dependent (the unintegrated diffractive parton\ndistributions) in proton are obtained with the help of the Kimber-Martin-Ryskin\nprescription where collinear diffractive PDFs are used as input. In this\ncalculation the transverse momentum of the pomeron is neglected with respect to\ntransverse momentum of partons entering the hard process. The results of the\nnew approach are compared with those of the standard collinear one.\nSignificantly larger cross sections are obtained in the $k_t$-factorization\napproach where some part of higher-order effects is effectively included. Some\ncorrelation observables, like azimuthal angle correlation between $c$ and $\\bar\nc$, and $c \\bar c$ pair transverse momentum distribution were obtained for the\nfirst time.\n", "  In this short paper we report that the dynamics of the earthquake (EQ)\npreparation processes, as embedded in the observed fracture-induced\nelectromagnetic emissions (EME), were characterized by critical and then\ntricritical behavior a few days before the occurrence of the recent Ioannina\n(Greece) earthquake [($39.79^o N, 20.69^o E$), 15 October 2016, $M_L=5.3$].\nSpecifically, an excerpt of the MHz EME recorded by our remote telemetric\nstation near the city of Ioannina five days before the EQ was found to possess\ncritical characteristics, followed by an excerpt possessing tricritical\ncharacteristics. The analysis was performed by means of the method of critical\nfluctuations (MCF) revealing critical.\n", "  An overview of quantum-mechanical methods to generate cross-section data for\nelectron collisions with atoms and molecules is presented. Particular emphasis\nis placed on the time-independent close-coupling approach, since it is\nparticularly suitable for low-energy collisions and also allows for systematic\nimprovements as well as uncertainty estimates. The basic ideas are illustrated\nwith examples for electron collisions with argon atoms and methane. For many\natomic systems, such as e-Ar collisions, highly reliable cross sections can now\nbe computed with quantified uncertainties. On the other hand, while electron\ncollision calculations with molecules do provide key input data for plasma\nmodels, the methods and computer codes presently used require further\ndevelopment to make these inputs robust.\n", "  This thesis discusses recent advances in precision calculations of quantum\nchromodynamics and their application to the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) physics\nprogram and beyond.\n", "  We review the impact of tetrahedral order on the macroscopic dynamics of\nbent-core liquid crystals. We discuss tetrahedral order comparing with other\ntypes of orientational order, like nematic, polar nematic, polar smectic, and\nactive polar order. In particular, we present hydrodynamic equations for\nphases, where only tetrahedral order exists or tetrahedral order is combined\nwith nematic order. Among the latter we discriminate between three cases, where\nthe nematic director (a) orients along a 4-fold, or (b) along a 3-fold symmetry\naxis of the tetrahedral structure. For the optically isotropic T_d phase, which\nonly has tetrahedral order, we focus on the coupling of flow with e.g.\ntemperature gradients and on the specific orientation behavior in external\nelectric fields. For the transition to the nematic phase, electric fields lead\nto a temperature shift that is linear in the field strength. Electric fields\ninduce nematic order, again linear in the field strength. If strong enough,\nelectric fields can change the tetrahedral structure and symmetry leading to a\npolar phase. We briefly deal with the T phase that arises when tetrahedral\norder occurs in a system of chiral molecules. To case (a) belong (i) the\nnon-polar, achiral, optically uniaxial D2d phase with ambidextrous helicity and\nwith orientational frustration in external fields, (ii) the non-polar\ntetragonal S4 phase, (iii) the non-polar, orthorhombic D2 phase that is\nstructurally chiral featuring ambidextrous chirality, (iv) the polar\northorhombic C2v phase, and (v) the polar monoclinic C2 phase. Case (b) results\nin a trigonal C3v phase that behaves like a biaxial polar nematic phase.\nFinally we discuss some experiments that show typical effects related to the\nexistence of tetrahedral order.\n", "  Inclusive charged-particle measurements probe the low-energy region of the\nnon-perturbative quantum chromodynamics. The ATLAS collaboration has recently\nmeasured the charged-particle multiplicity and its dependence on transverse\nmomentum and pseudorapidity in special data sets with low LHC beam currents,\nrecorded at centre-of-mass energies of 8 TeV and 13 TeV. The measurements at 8\nTeV cover a wide spectrum using charged-particle selections with minimum\ntransverse momentum of both 100 MeV and 500 MeV and in various phase space\nregions of low and high charged-particle multiplicities, some of which are\nstudied for the first time by ATLAS. The measurements at 13 TeV also present\ndetailed studies with a minimum transverse momentum of both 100 MeV and 500\nMeV. The measurements are compared with predictions of various tuned Monte\nCarlo generators and are found to provide strong constraints on these. None of\nthe Monte Carlo generators with their respective tunes are able to reproduce\nall the features of the data.\n", "  According to the holographic principle, the maximum amount of information\nstored in a region of space scales as the area of its two-dimensional surface,\nlike a hologram. We show that the holographic principle can be understood\nheuristically as originated from quantum fluctuations of spacetime. Applied to\ncosmology, this consideration leads to a dynamical cosmological constant\n$\\Lambda$ of the observed magnitude, in agreement with the result obtained for\nthe present and recent cosmic eras, by using unimodular gravity and causal-set\ntheory. By generalizing the concept of entropic gravity, we find a critical\nacceleration parameter related to $\\Lambda$ in galactic dynamics, and we\nconstruct a phenomenological model of dark matter which we call \"modified dark\nmatter\" (MDM). We provide successful observational tests of MDM at both the\ngalactic and cluster scales. We also discuss the possibility that the quanta of\nboth dark energy and dark matter obey the quantum Boltzmann statistics or\ninfinite statistics as described by a curious average of the bosonic and\nfermionic algebras.\n", "  We study many-body localization (MBL) and delocalization from the perspective\nof integrals of motion (IOMs). MBL can be understood phenomenologically through\nthe existence of macroscopically many localized IOMs. However, IOMs exist for\nall many-body systems, and non-localized IOMs determine properties on the\nergodic side of the MBL transition too. Here we explore their properties using\nour method of displacement transformations. We show how different quantities\ncan be calculated using the IOMs as an expansion in the number of operators.\nFor all values of disorder the typical IOMs are localized, suggesting the\nimportance of rare fluctuations in understanding the delocalization transition.\n", "  Online extremists in social networks pose a new form of threat to the general\npublic. These extremists range from cyberbullies who harass innocent users to\nterrorist organizations such as the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) that\nuse social networks to recruit and incite violence. Currently social networks\nsuspend the accounts of such extremists in response to user complaints. The\nchallenge is that these extremist users simply create new accounts and continue\ntheir activities. In this work we present a new set of operational capabilities\nto deal with the threat posed by online extremists in social networks.\n  Using data from several hundred thousand extremist accounts on Twitter, we\ndevelop a behavioral model for these users, in particular what their accounts\nlook like and who they connect with. This model is used to identify new\nextremist accounts by predicting if they will be suspended for extremist\nactivity. We also use this model to track existing extremist users as they\ncreate new accounts by identifying if two accounts belong to the same user.\nFinally, we present a model for searching the social network to efficiently\nfind suspended users' new accounts based on a variant of the classic Polya's\nurn setup. We find a simple characterization of the optimal search policy for\nthis model under fairly general conditions. Our urn model and main theoretical\nresults generalize easily to search problems in other fields.\n", "  We present medium resolution near infrared spectroscopic observations of 41\nobscured and intermediate class AGN (type 2, 1.9 and 1.8; AGN2) with redshift\n$z \\lesssim$0.1, selected from the Swift/BAT 70-month catalogue. The\nobservations have been carried out in the framework of a systematic study of\nthe AGN2 near infrared spectral properties and have been executed using\nISAAC/VLT, X-shooter/VLT and LUCI/LBT, reaching an average S/N ratio of\n$\\sim$30 per resolution element. For those objects observed with X-shooter we\nalso obtained simultaneous optical and UV spectroscopy. We have identified a\ncomponent from the broad line region in 13 out of 41 AGN2, with FWHM ${\\rm >\n800 }$ km/s. We have verified that the detection of the broad line region\ncomponents does not significantly depend on selection effects due to the\nquality of the spectra, the X-ray or near infrared fluxes, the orientation\nangle of the host galaxy or the hydrogen column density measured in the X-ray\nband. The average broad line region components found in AGN2 has a\nsignificantly (a factor 2) smaller FWHM if compared with a control sample of\ntype 1 AGN.\n", "  The quark transversity distribution inside nucleon is less understood than\nthe quark unpolarized and helicity distributions inside nucleon. In particular,\nit is important to know clearly why the quark helicity and transversity\ndistributions are different. We investigate the origin of their discrepancy.\n", "  The Future Circular Collider (FCC) is a post-LHC project aiming at searches\nfor physics beyond the SM in a new 80--100~km tunnel at CERN. Running in its\nfirst phase as a very-high-luminosity electron-positron collider (FCC-ee), it\nwill provide unique possibilities for indirect searches of new phenomena\nthrough high-precision tests of the SM. In addition, by collecting tens of\nab$^{-1}$ integrated luminosity in the range of center-of-mass energies\n$\\sqrt{s}$~=90--350~GeV, the FCC-ee also offers unique physics opportunities\nfor precise measurements of QCD phenomena and of photon-photon collisions\nthrough, literally, billions of hadronic final states as well as unprecedented\nlarge fluxes of quasireal $\\gamma$'s radiated from the $\\rm e^+e^-$ beams. We\nsuccinctly summarize the FCC-ee perspectives for high-precision extractions of\nthe QCD coupling, for detailed analyses of parton radiation and fragmentation,\nand for SM and BSM studies through $\\gamma\\gamma$ collisions.\n", "  According to the flow narrative commonly applied to high-energy nuclear\ncollisions a 1D cylindrical-quadrupole component of 2D angular correlations\nconventionally denoted by quantity $v_2$ is interpreted to represent elliptic\nflow: azimuth modulation of transverse or radial flow in noncentral\nnucleus-nucleus (A-A) collisions. The nonjet (NJ) quadrupole component exhibits\nvarious properties inconsistent with a flow or hydro interpretation, including\nthe observation that NJ-quadrupole centrality variation in $A$-$A$ collisions\nhas no relation to strongly-varying jet modification (\"jet quenching\") in those\ncollisions commonly attributed to jet interaction with a dense flowing medium.\nIn the present study I report isolation of quadrupole spectra from\n$p_t$-differential $v_2(p_t)$ data obtained at the relativistic heavy ion\ncollider (RHIC) and large hadron collider (LHCr). I demonstrate that NJ\nquadrupole spectra have characteristics very different from the single-particle\nspectra for most hadrons, that quadrupole spectra indicate a common boosted\nhadron source for a small minority of hadrons that \"carry\" the quadrupole\nstructure, that the narrow source-boost distribution is characteristic of an\nexpanding thin cylindrical shell (also strongly contradicting a hydro\ninterpretation), and that in the boost frame a single universal quadrupole\nspectrum (L\\'evy distribution) on transverse mass $m_t$ accurately describes\ndata for several hadron species scaled according to their statistical-model\nabundances. The quadrupole spectrum shape changes very little from RHIC to LHC\nenergies. Taken in combination those characteristics strongly suggest a unique\n{\\em nonflow} (and nonjet) QCD mechanism for the NJ quadrupole conventionally\nrepresented by $v_2$.\n", "  We discuss two topics on the experimental measurements of fluctuation\nobservables in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. First, we discuss the effects\nof the thermal blurring, i.e. the blurring effect arising from the experimental\nmeasurement of fluctuations in momentum space as a proxy of the thermal\nfluctuations defined in coordinate space, on higher order cumulants. Second, we\ndiscuss the effect of imperfect efficiency of detectors on the measurement of\nhigher order cumulants. We derive effective formulas which can carry out the\ncorrection of this effect for higher order cumulants based on the binomial\nmodel.\n", "  In this comment, we criticize three main conclusions of the\nletter\\cite{Lee2016}. We show that the concept of fractional winding\nnumber(FWN) is factitious, Lee's conclusions on Fig. 3 are finite-size effect\nand the breakdown of bulk-boundary correspondence (BBBC) cannot be explained by\n\"defective\".\n", "  Effects of substrate temperature, substrate wettability and particles\nconcentration are experimentally investigated for evaporation of a sessile\nwater droplet containing colloidal particles. Time-varying droplet shapes and\ntemperature of the liquid-gas interface are measured using high-speed\nvisualization and infrared thermography, respectively. The motion of the\nparticles inside the evaporating droplet is qualitatively visualized by an\noptical microscope and profile of final particle deposit is measured by an\noptical profilometer. On a non-heated hydrophilic substrate, a ring-like\ndeposit forms after the evaporation, as reported extensively in the literature;\nwhile on a heated hydrophilic substrate, a thinner ring with an inner deposit\nis reported in the present work. The latter is attributed to Marangoni\nconvection and recorded motion of the particles as well as measured temperature\ngradient across the liquid-gas interface confirms this hypothesis. The thinning\nof the ring scales with the substrate temperature and is reasoned to stronger\nMarangoni convection at larger substrate temperature. In case of a non-heated\nhydrophobic substrate, an inner deposit forms due to very early depinning of\nthe contact line. On the other hand, in case of a heated hydrophobic substrate,\nthe substrate heating as well as larger particle concentration helps in the\npinning of the contact line, which results in a thin ring with an inner\ndeposit. We propose a regime map for predicting three types of deposits namely,\nring, thin ring with inner deposit and inner deposit - for varying substrate\ntemperature, substrate wettability and particles concentration. A first-order\nmodel corroborates the liquid-gas interface temperature measurements and\nvariation in the measured ring profile with the substrate temperature.\n", "  Stellar astronomy, fueled by massive capital investments, advances in\nnumerical modeling and theory, is resurgent and arguably is on the verge of a\nmagnificent renaissance. Powerful time domain optical surveys, both on ground\nand in space, are producing data on variable stars on an unprecedented\nindustrial scale. Those with deep knowledge of variable stars will stand to\nbenefit from this resurgence. Notwithstanding these developments, in some\nastronomical communities, classical stellar astronomy has been in the doldrums.\nI offer a modest proposal to establish a basic level of familiarity with\nvariable stellar phenomenology and an attractive scheme to make research in\nvariable star astronomy visible, alluring and fashionable.\n", "  Results presented in this article demonstrate importance of taking into\naccount such a phenomenon as the solid solution decomposition at the boundaries\nseparating coexisting phases in lead-zirconate-titanate-based solid solutions\nwith compositions belonging to the morphotropic boundary region of the\n\"temperature-composition\" phase diagram. It is shown that in the local\ndecomposition of solid solutions in the vicinity of the boundaries separating\nthe tetragonal and rhombohedral phases in lead-zirconate-titanate-based solid\nsolutions lead to the changes of the chemical composition of the solid\nsolutions and to the formation of segregates. It is also shown that the proper\nthermoelectric treatment of samples containing these segregates can give\nsubstantially higher values of piezoelectric parameters in the\nlead-zirconate-titanate-based compounds.\n", "  Low power energy dispersive XRD-XRF portable instruments equipped with\nmultiple angle scanning can take advantage of the shorter acquisition time of\nEDXRD with respect to ADXRD, and bring closer higher accuracy and resolution of\ninter-planar distance with those obtained by ADXRD. The data produced by this\nnew hybrid configuration is correlated in the sense that a single XRF or XRD\nspecimen appear in multiple spectra (the later shifted in energy for differing\nangles). Hence, for fully benefit from the richer data released by this\nconfiguration, the analysis should not be confined to the independent\nprocessing of the spectra, specialized hybrid data processing should be\nconceived. We previously reported some advances in the processing of the\nresulting 3D data (intensity, energy and angle). Here the analytical\nperformance of the first hybrid angle-energy dispersive X-ray diffraction and\nfluorescence portable system is assessed for non-invasive surface mineral\nanalysis of samples relevant for archaeometrical applications. We evaluate the\nperformance on standard reference material and probe applicability of the\nmethods so developed to identify stones (jadeite and omphacite), and pigments\n(Prussian blue) in the pictorial layer of modeled paintings. Discussion\nemphasize the improvement in accuracy of interplanar distance with respect to\nEDXRD taken at a single fixed angles, evaluate the resolution of AD/EDXRD data,\nand total acquisition time.\n", "  We discuss the three-baryon interaction generated by the determinant\ninteraction of quarks, known as the Kobayashi-Maskawa-'t Hooft (KMT)\ninteraction. The expectation value of the KMT interaction operator is\ncalculated in fully-antisymmetrized quark-cluster model wave functions for\none-, two- and three-octet baryon states. The three-baryon potential from the\nKMT interaction is found to be repulsive for $NN\\Lambda$ and $N\\Lambda\\Lambda$\nsystems, while it is zero for the $NNN$ system. The strength and range of the\nthree-baryon potential are found to be comparable to those for the $NNN$\nthree-body potential obtained in lattice QCD simulations. The contribution to\nthe $\\Lambda$ single particle potential in nuclear matter is found to be 0.28\nMeV and 0.73 MeV in neutron matter and symmetric nuclear matter at normal\nnuclear density, respectively. These repulsive forces are not enough to solve\nthe hyperon puzzle, but may be measured in high-precision hyperisotope\nexperiments.\n", "  We develop a theoretical framework on the mechanism of combinatorial binding\nof transcription factors (TFs) with their specific binding sites on DNA. We\nconsider three possible mechanisms viz. monomer, hetero-oligomer and\ncoordinated recruitment pathways. In the monomer pathway, combinatorial TFs\nsearch for their targets in an independent manner and the protein-protein\ninteractions among them will be insignificant. The protein-protein interactions\nare very strong so that the hetero-oligomer complex of TFs as a whole searches\nfor the cognate sites in case of hetero-oligomer pathway. The TF which arrived\nfirst will recruit the adjacent TFs in a sequential manner in the recruitment\npathway. The free energy released from the protein-protein interactions among\nTFs will be in turn utilized to stabilize the TFs-DNA complex. Such coordinated\nbinding of TFs in fact emerges as the cooperative effect. Monomer and\nhetero-oligomer pathways are efficient only when few TFs are involved in the\ncombinatorial regulation. Detailed random walk simulations suggest that when\nthe number of TFs in a combination increases then the searching efficiency of\nTFs in these pathways decreases with the increasing number of TFs in a power\nlaw manner. The power law exponent associated with the monomer pathway seems to\nbe strongly dependent on the number of TFs, distance between the initial\nposition of TFs from their specific binding sites and the hop size associated\nwith the dynamics of TFs on DNA.\n", "  Spintronics aims to exploit the spin degree of freedom in solid state devices\nfor data storage and information processing technologies. The fundamental\nspintronic device concepts such as creation, manipulation and detection of spin\npolarization has been demonstrated in semiconductors and spin transistor\nstructures using both the electrical and optical methods. However, an unsolved\nchallenge in the field is the realization of all electrical methods to control\nthe spin polarization and spin transistor operation at ambient temperature. For\nthis purpose, two-dimensional (2D) crystals offer a unique platform due to\ntheir remarkable and contrasting spintronic properties, such as weak spin-orbit\ncoupling (SOC) in graphene and strong SOC in molybdenum disulfide (MoS$_2$).\nHere we combine graphene and MoS$_2$ in a van der Waals heterostructure to\nrealize the electric control of the spin polarization and spin lifetime, and\ndemonstrated a spin field-effect transistor (spin-FET) at room temperature in a\nnon-local measurement geometry. We observe electrical gate control of the spin\nvalve signal due to pure spin transport and Hanle spin precession signals in\nthe graphene channel in proximity with MoS$_2$ at room temperature. We show\nthat this unprecedented control over the spin polarization and lifetime stems\nfrom the gate-tuning of the Schottky barrier at the MoS$_2$/graphene interface\nand MoS$_2$ channel conductivity leading to spin interaction with high SOC\nmaterial. The all-electrical creation, transport and control of the spin\npolarization in a spin-FET device at room temperature is a substantial step in\nthe field of spintronics. It opens a new platform for the interplay of spin,\ncharge and orbital degrees of freedom for testing a plethora of exotic physical\nphenomena, which can be key building blocks in future device architectures.\n", "  Macrocellular silicone polymers are obtained after solidification of the\ncontinuous phase of a PDMS (polydimethylsiloxane) emulsion, which contains PEG\n(polyethylene glycol) drops of sub-millimetric dimensions. Coalescence of the\nliquid template emulsion is prohibited by a reactive blending approach. We\ninvestigate in detail the relationship between the interfacial properties and\nthe emulsion stability, and we use micro- and millifluidic techniques to\ngeneration macro-cellular polymers with controlled structural properties over a\nwider range of cell-sizes (0.2-2mm) and volume fractions of the continuous\nphase (0.1-40%). This approach could easily be transferred to a wide range of\npolymeric systems.\n", "  Recent progress in laser wakefield acceleration has led to the emergence of a\nnew generation of electron and X-ray sources that may have enormous benefits\nfor ultrafast science. These novel sources promise to become indispensable\ntools for the investigation of structural dynamics on the femtosecond time\nscale, with spatial resolution on the atomic scale. Here, we demonstrate the\nuse of laser-wakefield-accelerated electron bunches for time-resolved electron\ndiffraction measurements of the structural dynamics of single-crystal silicon\nnano-membranes pumped by an ultrafast laser pulse. In our proof-of-concept\nstudy, we resolve the silicon lattice dynamics on a picosecond time scale by\ndeflecting the momentum-time correlated electrons in the diffraction peaks with\na static magnetic field to obtain the time-dependent diffraction efficiency.\nFurther improvements may lead to femtosecond temporal resolution, with\nnegligible pump-probe jitter being possible with future\nlaser-wakefield-accelerator ultrafast-electron-diffraction schemes.\n", "  In the present work, a simple strategy is used to thermally oxidize TiN\nnanopowder (ca. 20 nm) to an anatase phase of a TiO2:Ti3+:N compound. In\ncontrast to the rutile phase of such a compound this photocatalyst provides\nphotocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution under AM1.5 conditions - this\nwithout the use of any noble metal co-catalyst. Moreover the photocatalyst is\nactive and stable over extended periods of time (tested for 4 months).\nImportantly, to achieve successful conversion to the active anatase polymorph,\nsufficiently small starting particles of TiN are needed. The key factor for\ncatalysis is the stabilization of the co-catalytically active Ti3+ species\nagainst oxidation by nitrogen present in the starting material.\n", "  We derive the full set of macroscopic equations necessary to describe the\ndynamics of systems with active polar order in a viscoelastic or elastic\nbackground. The active polar order is manifested by a second velocity, whose\nnon-zero modulus is the polar order parameter and whose direction is the polar\npreferred direction. Viscoelasticity is described by a relaxing strain field\nallowing for a straightforward change from transient to permanent elasticity.\nRelative rotations of the elastic structure with respect to the polar direction\nare taken into account. The intricate coupling between active polar order and\n(transient) elasticity leads to a combined relaxation of the polar order\nparameter and the strains. The rather involved sound spectrum contains a\nspecific excitation due to a reversible coupling between elasticity and polar\norder. Effects of chirality are also considered.\n", "  Mostly, optical spectroscopies are used to investigate the physics of\nexcitons, whereas their electrical evidences are hardly explored. Here, we\nexamined a forward bias activated differential capacitance response of\nGaInP-AlGaInP based multi-quantum well laser diodes to trace the presence of\nexcitons using electrical measurements. Occurrence of negative activation\nenergy after light emission is understood as thermodynamical signature of\nsteady state excitonic population under intermediate range of carrier\ninjections. Similar corroborative results are also observed in an InGaAs-GaAs\nquantum dot laser structure grown by molecular beam epitaxy. With increasing\nbiases, the measured differential capacitance response slowly vanishes. This\nrepresents gradual Mott transition of an excitonic phase into an electron-hole\nplasma in a GaInP-AlGaInP laser diode. This is further substantiated by more\nand more exponentially looking shapes of high energy tails in\nelectroluminescence spectra with increasing forward bias, which originates from\na growing non-degenerate population of free electrons and holes. Such an\nexperimental correlation between electrical and optical properties of excitons\ncan be used to advance the next generation excitonic devices.\n", "  In the present work we demonstrate the self-organized formation of anodic\nMo-oxide nanotube arrays grown on a Mo sheet under suitable electrochemical\nconditions in glycerol/NH4F electrolytes. The resulting amorphous tubes can be\ncrystallized by annealing to MoO2 or MoO3. The tube walls then can be further\nsulfurized fully or partially to Mo-sulfide to form well-ordered arrays of\nvertically aligned MoOx/MoS2 nanotubes. Under optimized conditions, defined\nMoS2 sheets form on the oxide walls in a layer by layer low angle zig-zag\narrangement that provide a high density of reactive stacking faults. These\ncore-shell nanotube arrays, consisting of tubes with a conductive suboxide core\nand a functional high defect density MoS2 coating, are highly promising for\napplications such as electrocatalysis (hydrogen evolution) or ion insertion\ndevices.\n", "  In this work, we design a TiO2 nanomembrane (TiNM) that can be used as a\nnanofilter platform for a selective enrichment of specific proteins. After use\nthe photocatalytic properties of TiO2 allow to decompose unwanted remnant on\nthe substrate and thus make the platform reusable. To construct this platform\nwe fabricate a free-standing TiO2 nanotube array and remove the bottom oxide to\nform a both-end open TiNM. By pyrolysis of the natural tube wall contamination\n(C/TiNM), the walls become decorated with graphitic carbon patches. Owing to\nthe large surface area, the amphiphilic nature and the charge adjustable\ncharacter, this C/TiNM can be used to extract and enrich hydrophobic and\ncharged biomolecules from solutions. Using human serum albumin (HSA) as a model\nprotein as well as protein mixtures, we show that the composite membrane\nexhibits a highly enhanced loading capacity and protein selectivity and is\nreusable after a short UV treatment.\n", "  Staphylococcus aureus is an important pathogen, giving rise to antimicrobial\nresistance in cell strains such as Methicillin Resistant S. aureus (MRSA). Here\nwe report an image analysis framework for automated detection and image\nsegmentation of cells in S. aureus cell clusters, and explicit identification\nof their cell division planes. We use a new combination of several existing\nanalytical tools of image analysis to detect cellular and subcellular\nmorphological features relevant to cell division from millisecond time scale\nsampled images of live pathogens at a detection precision of single molecules.\nWe demonstrate this approach using a fluorescent reporter GFP fused to the\nprotein EzrA that localises to a mid-cell plane during division and is involved\nin regulation of cell size and division. This image analysis framework presents\na valuable platform from which to study candidate new antimicrobials which\ntarget the cell division machinery, but may also have more general application\nin detecting morphologically complex structures of fluorescently labelled\nproteins present in clusters of other types of cells.\n", "  Because they may provide ultrathin, high-flux, and energy-efficient membranes\nfor precise ionic and molecular sieving in aqueous solution, GO membranes\n(partially oxidized, stacked sheets of graphene) have shown great potential in\nwater desalination and purification, gas and ion separation, biosensors, proton\nconductors, lithium-based batteries and super-capacitors. Unlike carbon\nnanotube (CNT) membranes, in which the nanotube pores have fixed sizes, the\npores of GO membranes - the interlayer spacing between GO sheets - are of\nvariable size. This presents a challenge for using GO membranes for filtration.\nDespite the great efforts to tune and fix the interlayer spacing, it remains\ndifficult both to reduce the interlayer spacing sufficiently to exclude small\nions while keeping this separation constant against the tendency of GO\nmembranes to swell when immersed in aqueous solution, which greatly affects the\napplications of GO membranes. Here, we demonstrate experimentally that highly\nefficient and selective ion rejection by GO membranes can be readily achieved\nby controlling the interlayer spacing of GO membranes using cations (K+, Na+,\nCa2+, Li+ and Mg2+) themselves. The interspacing can be controlled with\nprecision as small as 1 A, and GO membranes controlled by one kind of cation\ncan exclude other cations with a larger hydrated volume, which can only be\naccommodated with a larger interlayer spacing. First-principles calculations\nreveal that the strong noncovalent cation-pi interactions between hydrated\ncations in solution and aromatic ring structures in GO are the cause of this\nunexpected behavior. These findings open up new avenues for using GO membranes\nfor water desalination and purification, lithium-based batteries and\nsuper-capacitors, molecular sieves for separating ions or molecules, and many\nother applications.\n", "  Debris discs are often modelled assuming compact dust grains, but more and\nmore evidence for the presence of porous grains is found. We aim at quantifying\nthe systematic errors introduced when modelling debris discs composed of porous\ndust with a disc model assuming spherical, compact grains. We calculate the\noptical dust properties derived via the fast, but simple effective medium\ntheory. The theoretical lower boundary of the size distribution -- the\nso-called 'blowout size' -- is compared in the cases of compact and porous\ngrains. Finally, we simulate observations of hypothetical debris discs with\ndifferent porosities and feed them into a fitting procedure using only compact\ngrains. The deviations of the results for compact grains from the original\nmodel based on porous grains are analysed. We find that the blowout size\nincreases with increasing grain porosity up to a factor of two. An analytical\napproximation function for the blowout size as a function of porosity and\nstellar luminosity is derived. The analysis of the geometrical disc set-up,\nwhen constrained by radial profiles, are barely affected by the porosity.\nHowever, the determined minimum grain size and the slope of the grain size\ndistribution derived using compact grains are significantly overestimated.\nThus, the unexpectedly high ratio of minimum grain size to blowout size found\nby previous studies using compact grains can be partially described by dust\ngrain porosity, although the effect is not strong enough to completely explain\nthe trend.\n", "  The concern of this article is a semiclassical Weyl calculus on an infinite\ndimensional Hilbert space $H$. If $(i, H, B)$ is a Wiener triplet associated to\n$H$, the quantum state space will be the space of $L^2$ functions on $B$ with\nrespect to a Gaussian measure with $h/2$ variance, where $h$ is the\nsemiclassical parameter. We prove the boundedness of our pseudodifferential\noperators (PDO) in the spirit of Calder\\'on-Vaillancourt with an explicit\nbound, a Beals type characterization, and metaplectic covariance. An\napplication to a model of quantum electrodynamics (QED) is added in the last\nsection, for fixed spin $1/2$ particles interacting with the quantized\nelectromagnetic field (photons). We prove that some observable time evolutions,\nthe spin evolutions, the magnetic and electric evolutions when subtracting\ntheir free evolutions, are PDO in our class.\n", "  We give the semiclassical asymptotic of barrier-top resonances for\nSchr\\\"{o}dinger operators on ${\\mathbb R}^{n}$, $n \\geq 1$, whose potential is\n$C^{\\infty}$ everywhere and analytic at infinity. In the globally analytic\nsetting, this has already been obtained. Our proof is based on a propagation of\nsingularities theorem at a hyperbolic fixed point that we establish here. This\nlast result refines a theorem of the same authors, and its proof follows\nanother approach.\n", "  Metal electrodes are a universal element of all electronic devices.\nConducting SrRuO3 (SRO) epitaxial thin films have been extensively used as\nelectrodes in complex-oxide heterostructures due to good lattice mismatches\nwith perovskite substrates. However, when compared to SRO single crystals, SRO\nthin films have shown reduced conductivity and Curie temperatures (T_C), which\ncan lead to higher Joule heating and energy loss in the devices. Here, we\nreport that high-quality SRO thin films can be synthesized by controlling the\nplume dynamics and growth rate of pulsed laser epitaxy (PLE) with real-time\noptical spectroscopic monitoring. The SRO thin films grown under the\nkinetically controlled conditions, down to ca. 16 nm in thickness, exhibit both\nenhanced conductivity and T_C as compared to bulk values, due to their improved\nstoichiometry and a strain-mediated increase of the bandwidth of Ru 4d\nelectrons. This result provides a direction for enhancing the physical\nproperties of PLE-grown thin films and paves a way for improved device\napplications.\n", "  Single photon superradiance is a strong enhancement of spontaneous emission\nappearing when a single excitation is shared between a large number of\ntwo-level systems. This enhanced rate can be accompanied by a shift of the\nemission frequency, the cooperative Lamb shift, issued from the exchange of\nvirtual photons between the emitters. In this work we present a semiconductor\noptoelectronic device allowing the observation of these two phenomena at room\ntemperature. We demonstrate experimentally and theoretically that plasma\noscillations in spatially separated quantum wells interact through real and\nvirtual photon exchange. This gives rise to a superradiant mode displaying a\nlarge cooperative Lamb shift.\n", "  Cosmic ray detectors use air as a radiator for luminescence. In water and\nice, Cherenkov light is the dominant light producing mechanism when the\nparticle's velocity exceeds the Cherenkov threshold, approximately three\nquarters of the speed of light in vacuum. Luminescence is produced by highly\nionizing particles passing through matter due to the electronic excitation of\nthe surrounding molecules. The observables of luminescence, such as the\nwavelength spectrum and decay times, are highly dependent on the properties of\nthe medium, in particular, temperature and purity. The results for the light\nyield of luminescence of previous measurements vary by two orders of magnitude.\nIt will be shown that even for the lowest measured light yield, luminescence is\nan important signature of highly ionizing particles below the Cherenkov\nthreshold. These could be magnetic monopoles or other massive and highly\nionizing exotic particles. With the highest observed efficiencies, luminescence\nmay even contribute significantly to the light output of standard model\nparticles such as the PeV IceCube neutrinos. We present analysis techniques to\nuse luminescence in neutrino telescopes and discuss experimental setups to\nmeasure the light yield of luminescence for the particular conditions in\nneutrino detectors.\n", "  Around the time of its perihelion passage the observability of\n67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko from Earth was limited to very short windows each\nmorning from any given site, due to the low solar elongation of the comet. The\npeak in the comet's activity was therefore difficult to observe with\nconventionally scheduled telescopes, but was possible where service/queue\nscheduled mode was possible, and with robotic telescopes. We describe the\nrobotic observations that allowed us to measure the total activity of the comet\naround perihelion, via photometry (dust) and spectroscopy (gas), and compare\nthese results with the measurements at this time by Rosetta's instruments. The\npeak of activity occurred approximately two weeks after perihelion. The total\nbrightness (dust) largely followed the predictions from Snodgrass et al. 2013,\nwith no significant change in total activity levels from previous apparitions.\nThe CN gas production rate matched previous orbits near perihelion, but\nappeared to be relatively low later in the year.\n", "  We report on NuSTAR observations of the Intermediate Polar GK Persei which\nalso behaves as a Dwarf Nova. It exhibited a Dwarf Nova outburst in 2015\nMarch-April. The object was observed in 3-79 keV X-rays with NuSTAR, once at\nthe outburst peak, and again in 2015 September during quiescence. The 5-50 keV\nflux during the outburst was 26 times higher than that during the quiescence.\nWith a multi-temperature emission model and a reflection model, we derived the\npost-shock temperature as 19.2 +/- 0.7 keV in the outburst, and 38.5 +4.1/-3.6\nkeV in the quiescence. This temperature difference is considered to reflect\nchanges in the radius at which the accreting matter, forming an accretion disk,\nis captured by the magnetosphere of the white dwarf (WD). Assuming that this\nradius scales as the power of -2/7 of the mass accretion rate, and utilizing\nthe two temperature measurements, as well as the standard mass-radius relation\nof WDs, we determined the WD mass in GK Persei as 0.90 +/- 0.06 solar masses.\nThe magnetic field is estimated as 4*10^5 G.\n", "  Up to now, the rotational velocities of galaxies are not clearly understood\nand the experimental Tully Fisher rule, linking the total galactic mass to the\nfourth power of the velocity, through an acceleration coefficient of about\n10-10 m/s2 has not found a deep theoretical explanation. Tentative proposals\n(MOND theory of a modified Newton s law and extraneous dark matter) do not\nbring a definite clarification. We propose here a new approach to this problem,\nwithout exotic matter and using the classical Newton force. But we introduce a\nnew additional universal acceleration, which could represent a universal\nexpansion law valid at the scale level of a galaxy. We show that this\nhypothesis leads to a good description of the observed variations of the\ngalactic transverse velocity. It can be considered as a consequence of the\nScale Expansion Cosmos theory (SEC) introduced by J. Masreliez, but we\npostulate that the space expansion acceleration universally applies at any\nscale. We obtain a formal derivation of the Tully Fisher law, linking the\nconstant galactic transverse velocity to its total mass, via the universal\nminimum acceleration. We derive a good estimate of the TF acceleration\ncoefficient and show that expansion should be proportional to the square root\nof the local volumic mass density. Our conjecture is in fact a new dynamics\nprinciple which could be applied to many other physical problems at different\nscales. Applying it to the range of the solar planet system confirms the well\nknown Kepler laws, at least as a valid approximation for the order of magnitude\nof the solar system.\n", "  In this paper, we endeavour to obtain a modified form of the Foldy-Wouthuysen\nand Cini-Toushek transformations by resorting to the noncommutative nature of\nspace-time geometry, starting from the Klein-Gordon equation. Also, we obtain a\nshift in the energy levels due to noncommutativity and from these results a\nlimit for the Lorentz factor in the ultra-relativistic case has been derived in\nconformity with observations\n", "  The split octonionic form of Dirac and Maxwell equations are found. In\ncontrast with the previous attempts these equations are derived from the\noctonionic analyticity condition and also we use different basis of the\n8-dimensional space of split octonions.\n", "  A book chapter where a new matrix function of the HMO Hamiltonian is proposed\nto deal with the Quantum Interference phenomenon in conjugated organic\nmolecules.\n", "  We propose an architecture based on Quantum cellular Automata which allows\nthe use of only one type of quantum gates per computational step in order to\nperform nearest neighbor interactions. The model is built in partial steps,\neach one of them analyzed using nearest neighbor interactions, starting with\nsingle qubit operations and continuing with two qubit ones. The effectiveness\nof the model is tested and valuated by developing a quantum circuit\nimplementing the Quantum Fourier Transform. The important outcome of this\nvalidation was that the operations are performed in a local and controlled\nmanner thus reducing the error rate of each computational step.\n", "  One of the characteristic features of low-mass stars is their propensity to\nshed large amounts of angular momentum throughout their evolution. This\ndistinguishs them from brown dwarfs which remain fast rotators over timescales\nof gigayears. Brown dwarfs with rotation periods longer than a couple of days\nhave only been found in star forming regions and young clusters. This is a\nuseful constraint on the mass dependency of mechanisms for angular momentum\nregular in stars. Rotational braking by disks and winds become highly\ninefficient in the substellar regime. In this short review I discuss the\nobservational evidence for the fast rotation in brown dwarfs, the implications,\nand the link to the spin-mass relation in planets.\n", "  The location of the critical end point (CEP) and the isentropic trajectories\nin the QCD phase diagram are investigated. We use the (2+1)\nNambu$-$Jona-Lasinio model with the Polyakov loop coupling for different\nscenarios, namely by imposing zero strange quark density, which is the case in\nthe ultra relativistic heavy-ion collisions, and $\\beta$-equilibrium. The\ninfluence of strong magnetic fields and of the vector interaction on the\nisentropic trajectories around the CEP is discussed. It is shown that the\nvector interaction and the magnetic field, having opposite effects on the\nfirst-order transition, affect the isentropic trajectories differently: as the\nvector interaction increases, the first-order transition becomes weaker and the\nisentropes become smoother; when a strong magnetic field is considered, the\nfirst-order transition is strengthened and the isentropes are pushed to higher\ntemperatures. No focusing of isentropes in region towards the CEP is seen.\n", "  In the present work, we introduce the anodic growth of conical shaped TiO2\nnanotube arrays. These titania nanocones provide a scaffold for dye-sensitized\nsolar cell (DSSC) structures with significantly improved photon management,\nproviding an optimized absorption profile compared with conventional\ncylindrical nanotube arrays. Finite difference time domain (FDTD) modelling\ndemonstrates a drastically changed power-absorption characteristic over the\ntube length. When used in a back-side illumination DSSC configuration, nanocone\nstructures can reach over 60 % higher solar cell conversion efficiency than\nconventional tubes. The resulting {\\eta} of ca. 8 % represents one of the\nhighest reported values for Graetzel type DSSCs used under back-side\nillumination.\n", "  The possibility to excite Surface Plasmon Polaritons (SPPs) at the interface\nbetween two media depends on the optical properties of both media and\ngeometrical aspects. Specific conditions allowing the coupling of light with a\nplasmon-active interface must be satisfied. Plasmonic effects are well\ndescribed in noble metals where the imaginary part of the dielectric\npermittivity is often neglected (\"perfect medium approximation\"). However, some\nsystems exist for which such approximation cannot be applied, hence requiring a\nrefinement of the common SPP theory. In this context, several properties of\nSPPs such as excitation conditions, period of the electromagnetic field\nmodulation and SPP lifetime then may strongly deviate from that of the perfect\nmedium approximation. In this paper, calculations taking into account the\nimaginary part of the dielectric permittivities are presented. The model\nidentifies analytical terms which should not be neglected in the mathematical\ndescription of SPPs on lossy materials. These calculations are applied to\nnumerous material combinations resulting in a prediction of the corresponding\nSPP features. A list of plasmon-active interfaces is provided along with a\nquantification of the above mentioned SPP properties in the regime where the\nperfect medium approximation is not applicable.\n", "  We provide a general framework for the optimal design of surface energies on\nnetworks. We prove sharp bounds for the homogenization of discrete systems\ndescribing mixtures of ferromagnetic interactions by constructing optimal\nmicrogeometries, and we prove a localization principle which allows to reduce\nto the periodic setting in the general nonperiodic case.\n", "  We describe our recent lattice study of SU(4) gauge theory with fermions in\nthe fundamental and sextet representations. In this theory, a new type of\nbaryon consists of quarks in both representations. The spectrum of these\n\"chimera baryons\" has a straightforward interpretation in terms of a\nnon-relativistic quark model based on SU(4). Our results are particularly\nrelevant to composite Higgs models in which the top quark is partially\ncomposite.\n", "  Gravitational features are a fundamental source of information to learn more\nabout the interior structure and composition of planets, moons, asteroids and\ncomets. Gravitational field modeling typically approximates the target body\nwith a sphere, leading to a representation in spherical harmonics. However,\nsmall celestial bodies are often irregular in shape, and hence poorly\napproximated by a sphere. A much better suited geometrical fit is achieved by a\ntri-axial ellipsoid. This is also mirrored in the fact that the associated\nharmonic expansion (ellipsoidal harmonics) shows a significantly better\nconvergence behavior as opposed to spherical harmonics. Unfortunately, complex\nmathematics and numerical problems (arithmetic overflow) so far severely\nlimited the applicability of ellipsoidal harmonics. In this paper, we present a\nmethod that allows expanding ellipsoidal harmonics to a considerably higher\ndegree compared to existing techniques. We apply this novel approach to model\nthe gravitational field of comet 67P, the final target of the Rosetta mission.\nThe comparison of results based on the ellipsoidal parameterization with those\nbased on the spheroidal and spherical approximations reveals that the latter is\nclearly inferior; the spheroidal solution, on the other hand, is virtually just\nas accurate as the ellipsoidal one. Finally, in order to generalize our\nfindings, we assess the gravitational field modeling performance for some 400\nsmall bodies in the solar system. From this investigation we generally conclude\nthat the spheroidal representation is an attractive alternative to the complex\nellipsoidal parameterization on the one hand, and the inadequate spherical\nrepresentation on the other hand.\n", "  The electric polarization hysteresis loops and remanent polarization were\nrevealed in multiferroics RMn$_2$O$_5$ with $R = Gd$ and $Bi$ at wide\ntemperature interval from 5 K up to 330 K. Until recently, the long-range\nferroelectric order having an exchange-striction magnetic nature had been\nobserved in RMn$_2$O$_5$ only at low temperatures ($T\\leq T_C = 30$ -- 35 K).\nWe believe that the polarization we observed was caused by the frozen\nsuperparaelectric state which was formed by the restricted polar domains\nresulting from phase separation and charge carriers self-organization. At some\nsufficiently high temperatures $T\\gg T_C$ the frozen superparaelectric state\nwas destroyed, and the conventional superparaelectric state occurred. This\nhappened when the potential barriers of the restricted polar domain\nreorientations become equal to the kinetic energy of the itinerant electrons\n(leakage). The hysteresis loops were measured by the so-called PUND method\nwhich allowed us to correctly subtract the contribution of conductivity from\nthe measured polarization. The correlations between properties of the phase\nseparation domains and polarization were revealed and studied. The\nhigh-temperature polarization also had a magnetic nature and was controlled by\nthe magnetic field because the double exchange between pairs of Mn ions with\ndifferent valences (Mn$^{3+}$ and Mn$^{4+}$) in RMn$_2$O$_5$ was the basic\ninteraction resulting in phase separation.\n", "  It is conventionally thought that New Zealand's distance from the large,\nnorthern hemisphere centres of learning, and our relatively small population\nand wealth, are detrimental to the contribution we can make to the advancement\nof scientific knowledge. Here the reverse point of view is argued.\n", "  Einstein's theory of general relativity models the physical universe using\nspacetimes which satisfy Einstein's gravitational field equations. To date,\nEinstein's theory has been enormously successful in modeling observed\ngravitational phenomena, both at the astrophysical and the cosmological levels.\n  The collection of spacetime solutions of Einstein's equations which have been\neffectively used for modeling the physical universe is a very small subset of\nthe full set of solutions. Among this larger set, there are many spacetimes in\nwhich strange phenomena related to time are present: There are solutions\ncontaining regions in which determinism and the predictability of experimental\noutcomes breaks down (the Taub-NUT spacetimes), and there others in which the\nbreakdown of determinism occurs everywhere (the G\\\"odel universe).\n  Should the existence of these strange solutions lead us to question the\nusefulness of Einstein's theory in modeling physical phenomena? Should it\ninstead lead us to seriously search for strange time phenomena in physics? Or\nshould we simply treat these solutions as anomalous (if embarrassing)\ndistractions which we can ignore?\n  In this essay, after introducing some basic ideas of special and general\nrelativity and discussing what it means for a spacetime to be a solution of\nEinstein's equations, we explore the use of spacetime solutions for modeling\nastrophysical events and cosmology. We then examine some of the spacetime\nsolutions in which determinism and causal relationships break down, we relate\nsuch phenomena to Penrose's \"Strong Cosmic Censorship Conjecture\", and finally\nwe discuss the questions noted above.\n", "  We explain how to couple topological B-models whose targets are\nnon-K\\\"ahlerian manifolds to topological gravity and to thus define\ncorresponding topological strings. We emphasize the need to take into account\nthe coupling to the superghost field of topological gravity in order to obtain\na consistent definition of the string model. We also review the importance of\nthe superghost for correctly interpreting the holomorphic anomaly of the string\namplitudes. We perform our analysis in the BV framework in order to make it\ncompletely gauge independent.\n", "  Cosmological consequences of a strictly valid total energy conservation for\nthe whole universe are investigated in this paper. Interestingly enough as one\nconsequence of ergodically behaving universes very specific scaling laws with\nthe diameter R of the universe can be derived for relevant cosmic quantities.\nEspecially the 1/R^2- scaling of mass - and vacuum energy - density then\nautomatically leads to a vanishing cosmic curvature parameter k=0 and also\nreveals, that for such universes no horizon problem occurs. In addition the\nlongstanding problem of observationally indicated very low cosmic vacuum\nenergies in contrast to the very large quantumfield estimates is easily solved\nwhen the vacuum energy density decay with 1/R^2 is taken into account\nreconciling presently observed vacuum energy density values with those from\ntheoretical expectations. We also suggest why the mass of the universe can\npermanently increase and can in fact grow up from a Planck mass as a pure\nvacuum fluctuation.\n", "  In this article we want to answer the cosmologically relevant question what,\nwith some good semantic and physical reason, could be called the mass of an\ninfinitely extended, homogeneously matter-filled and expanding universe. To\nanswer this question we produce a space-like sum of instantaneous cosmic energy\ndepositions surrounding equally each spacepoint in the homogeneous universe. We\ncalculate the added-up instantaneous cosmic energy per volume around an\narbitrary space point in the expanding universe. To carry out this sum we use\nas basic metrics an analogy to the inner Schwarzschild metric applied to stars,\nbut this time applied to the spacepoint-related universe. It is then shown that\nthis leads to the added-up proper energy within a sphere of a finite outer\ncritical radius defining the point-related infinity. As a surprise this radius\nturns out to be reciprocal to the square root of the prevailing average cosmic\nenergy density. The equivalent mass of the universe can then also be calculated\nand, by the expression which is obtained here, shows a scaling with this\ncritical radius of this universe, a virtue of the universe which was already\noften called for in earlier works by E.Mach, H.Thirring and F.Hoyle and others.\nThis radius on the other hand can be shown to be nearly equal to the\nSchwarzschild radius of the so-defined mass of the universe.\n"]}
