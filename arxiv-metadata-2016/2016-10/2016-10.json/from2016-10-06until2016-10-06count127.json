We calculate the probability\ndistribution of the metastable state of the plasmids and show on this example\nthat the reaction rate equations may fail in predicting the average number of\nregulated molecules even when this number is large, and the time is much\nshorter than the mean extinction time.\n", "  The influence of a topological defect in graphene on the ground state of\nelectronic quasiparticle excitations is studied in the framework of the\nlong-wavelength continuum model originating in the tight-binding approximation\nfor the nearest neighbour interaction in the graphitic lattice. A topological\ndefect that rolls up a graphitic sheet into a nanocone is represented by a\npointlike pseudomagnetic vortex with a flux which is related to the deficit\nangle of the cone. The method of self-adjoint extensions is employed to define\nthe set of physically acceptable boundary conditions at the apex of the\nnanocone. The electronic system on a graphitic nanocone is found to acquire the\nground state condensate and current of special type, and we determine the\ndependence of these quantities on the deficit angle of the nanocone, continuous\nparameter of the boundary condition at the apex, and the distance from the\napex.\n", "  The pivot algorithm for self-avoiding walks has been implemented in a manner\nwhich is dramatically faster than previous implementations, enabling extremely\nlong walks to be efficiently simulated. We explicitly describe the data\nstructures and algorithms used, and provide a heuristic argument that the mean\ntime per attempted pivot for $N$-step self-avoiding walks is $O(1)$ for the\nsquare and simple cubic lattices. Numerical experiments conducted for\nself-avoiding walks with up to 268 million steps are consistent with $o(\\log\nN)$ behavior for the square lattice and $O(\\log N)$ behavior for the simple\ncubic lattice. Our method can be adapted to other models of polymers with\nshort-range interactions, on the lattice or in the continuum, and hence\npromises to be widely useful.\n", "  We calculate the soft gluon radiation spectrum off heavy quarks (HQs)\ninteracting with light quarks (LQs) beyond small angle scattering (eikon-\nality) approximation and thus generalize the dead-cone formula of heavy quarks\nextensively used in the literatures of Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) phenomenology\nto the large scattering angle regime which may be im- portant in the energy\nloss of energetic heavy quarks in the deconfined Quark-Gluon Plasma medium. In\nthe proper limits, we reproduce all the relevant existing formulae for the\ngluon radiation distribution off energetic quarks, heavy or light used in the\nQGP phenomenology.\n", "  Point defects in Ga- and Al-doped ZnO thin films are studied by means of\nfirst principles electronic structure calculations. Candidate defects are\nidentified to explain recently observed differences in electrical and\nspectroscopical behavior of both systems. Substitutional doping in Ga-ZnO\nexplain the metallic behavior of the electrical properties. Complexes of\ninterstitial oxygen with substitutional Ga can behave as acceptor and cause\npartial compensation, as well as gap states below the conduction band minimum\nas observed in photoemission experiments. Zn vacancies can also act as\ncompensating acceptors. On the other hand, the semiconducting behavior of\nAl-ZnO and the small variation in the optical gap compared with pure ZnO, can\nbe explained by almost complete compensation between acceptor Zn vacancies and\nsubstitutional Al donors. Interstitial Al can also be donor levels and can be\nthe origin of the small band observed in photoemission experiments below the\nFermi level. Combinations of substitutional Al with interstitial oxygen can act\nsimultaneously as compensating acceptor and generator o the mentioned\nphotoemission band. The theoretical calculations have been done using density\nfunctional theory (DFT) within the generalized gradient approximation with\non-site Coulomb interaction. In selected cases, DFT calculations with\nsemilocal-exact exchange hybrid functionals have been performed. Results are\ncompared with photoelectron spectra for Ga-ZnO and Al-ZnO at the corresponding\ndoping levels.\n", "  A perfectly reflecting (Dirichlet) boundary condition at the edge of an\nimpenetrable magnetic-flux-carrying tube of nonzero transverse size is imposed\non the charged massive scalar matter field which is quantized outside the tube.\nWe show that the vacuum polarization effects outside the tube give rise to a\nmacroscopic force acting at the increase of the tube radius (if the magnetic\nflux is held steady). The Casimir energy and force are periodic in the value of\nthe magnetic flux, being independent of the coupling to the space-time\ncurvature scalar. We conclude that a topological defect of the vortex type can\npolarize the vacuum of only those quantum fields that have masses which are\nmuch less than a scale of the spontaneous symmetry breaking.\n", "  We derive the large-N, all order asymptotic expansion for a system of N\nparticles with mean-field interactions on top of a Coulomb repulsion at\ntemperature 1/\\beta, under the assumptions that the interactions are analytic,\noff-critical, and satisfy a local strict convexity assumption.\n", "  Landauer principle describes the minimum heat produced by an\ninformation-processing device. Recently a new term has been included in the\nminimum heat production: it's called conditional entropy and takes into account\nthe microstates content of a given logic state. Usually this term is assumed\nzero in bistable symmetric systems thanks to the strong hypothesis used to\nderive Landauer principle. In this paper we show that conditional entropy can\nbe nonzero even for bistable symmetric systems and that it can be expressed as\nthe sum of three different terms related to the probabilistic features of the\ndevice. The contribution of the three terms to conditional entropy (and thus to\nminimum heat production) is then discussed for the case of bit-reset.\n", "  We develop a new perturbation method for studying quasi-neutral competition\nin a broad class of stochastic competition models, and apply it to the analysis\nof fixation of competing strains in two epidemic models. The first model is a\ntwo-strain generalization of the stochastic Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible\n(SIS) model. Here we extend previous results due to Parsons and Quince (2007),\nParsons et al (2008) and Lin, Kim and Doering (2012). The second model, a\ntwo-strain generalization of the stochastic Susceptible-Infected-Recovered\n(SIR) model with population turnover, has not been studied previously. In each\nof the two models, when the basic reproduction numbers of the two strains are\nidentical, a system with an infinite population size approaches a point on the\ndeterministic coexistence line (CL): a straight line of fixed points in the\nphase space of sub-population sizes. Shot noise drives one of the strain\npopulations to fixation, and the other to extinction, on a time scale\nproportional to the total population size. Our perturbation method explicitly\ntracks the dynamics of the probability distribution of the sub-populations in\nthe vicinity of the CL. We argue that, whereas the slow strain has a\ncompetitive advantage for mathematically \"typical\" initial conditions, it is\nthe fast strain that is more likely to win in the important situation when a\nfew infectives of both strains are introduced into a susceptible population.\n", "  We overview the recent results on the shift of the spectrum and norm bounds\nfor variation of spectral subspaces of a Hermitian operator under an additive\nHermitian perturbation. Along with the known results, we present a new subspace\nvariation bound for the generic off-diagonal subspace perturbation problem. We\nalso demonstrate how some of the abstract results may work for few-body\nHamiltonians.\n", "  We conjecture that (when the notion of Hadamard state is suitably adapted)\nthere is no isometry-invariant Hadamard state for the massive or massless\ncovariant Klein-Gordon equation defined on the region of the Kruskal spacetime\nto the left of a surface of constant Schwarzschild radius in the right\nSchwarzschild wedge when Dirichlet boundary conditions are put on that surface.\nWe also prove that, with a suitable definition for 'boost-invariant Hadamard\nstate' (which we call 'strongly boost-invariant globally-Hadamard') which takes\ninto account both the existence of the timelike boundary and the special\nmassless 1+1 infra-red pathology, there is no such state for the massless wave\nequation on the region of 1+1 Minkowski space to the left of an eternally\nuniformly accelerating mirror -- with Dirichlet boundary conditions. This\nresult is significant because such a state does exist if there is also a\nsymmetrically placed decelerating mirror in the left wedge (and the region to\nthe left of this mirror is excluded). We expect a similar existence result to\nhold for Kruskal when there are symmetrically placed spherical boxes in both\nright and left Schwarzschild wedges. Our Kruskal no-go conjecture raises basic\nquestions about the black holes in boxes considered in black hole\nthermodynamics. If true, it would lend further support to the conclusion of\nB.S. Kay 'Instability of enclosed horizons', Gen. Rel. Grav. 47, 1-27 (2015)\n(arXiv: 1310.7395) that the nearest thing to a description of a black hole in\nequilibrium in a box in terms of a classical spacetime with quantum fields\npropagating on it has, for the classical spacetime, the exterior Schwarzschild\nsolution, with the classical spacetime picture breaking down near the horizon.\nAn appendix points out the existence of, and partially fills, a gap in the\nproofs of the theorems in B.S. Kay and R.M. Wald Phys. Rep. 207, 49-136 (1991).\n", "  We study terminally attached self-avoiding walks and bridges on the simple\ncubic lattice, both by series analysis and Monte Carlo methods. We provide\nstrong numerical evidence supporting a scaling relation between self-avoiding\nwalks, bridges, and terminally attached self-avoiding walks, and posit that a\ncorresponding amplitude ratio is a universal quantity.\n", "  Statistical mechanics is one of the most comprehensive theories in physics.\nFrom a boiling pot of water to the complex dynamics of quantum many-body\nsystems it provides a successful connection between the microscopic dynamics of\natoms and molecules and the macroscopic properties of matter. However,\nstatistical mechanics only describes the thermal equilibrium situation of a\nsystem, and there is no general framework to describe how equilibrium is\nreached or under which circumstances it can be reached at all. This problem is\nparticularly challenging in quantum mechanics, where unitarity appears to\nrender the very concept of thermalization counterintuitive. With the rapid\nexperimental progress in the control and probing of ultracold quantum gases\nthis question has become within reach of detailed experimental investigations.\nIn these notes we present a series of experiments with ultracold\none-dimensional Bose gases, which provide novel insights into this fundamental\nquestion.\n", "  The quantum states and thermodynamical properties of the Te vacancy in CdTe\nare addressed by first principles calculations, including the supercell size\nand quasiparticle corrections. It is shown that the 64-atoms supercell\ncalculation is not suitable to model the band structure of the isolated Te\nvacancy. This problem can be solved with a larger 216-atoms supercell, where\nthe band structure of the defect seems to be a perturbation of that of the\nperfect crystal. It is interesting to note that the Te-vacancy formation energy\ncalculated with both supercell sizes are close in energy, which is attributed\nto error cancelation. We also show that the interplay between supercell size\neffects and the band gap underestimation of the generalized gradient\napproximation strongly influences the predicted symmetry of some charge states.\n", "  We analyze the atom field-effect transistor scheme [J. A. Stickney, D. Z.\nAnderson and A. A. Zozulya, Phys. Rev. A 75, 013608 (2007)] using the standard\ntools of nonequlilibrium dynamics. In particular, we study the deviations from\nthe Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis, quantum fluctuations, and the density\nof states, both ab initio and using their mean-field analogues. Having fully\nestablished the quantum vs. mean-field correspondence for this system, we\nattempt, using a mean-field model, to interpret the off-on threshold in our\ntransistor as the onset of ergodicity---a point where the system becomes able\nto visit the thermal values of the former integrals of motion in principle,\nalbeit not being fully thermalized yet.\n", "  We present measurements of Collins asymmetries in the inclusive process\n$e^+e^- \\rightarrow h_1 h_2 X$, $h_1h_2=KK,\\, K\\pi,\\, \\pi\\pi$, at the\ncenter-of-mass energy of 10.6 GeV, using a data sample of 468 fb$^{-1}$\ncollected by the BaBar experiment at the PEP-II $B$ factory at SLAC National\nAccelerator Center. Considering hadrons in opposite thrust hemispheres of\nhadronic events, we observe clear azimuthal asymmetries in the ratio of unlike-\nto like-sign, and unlike- to all charged $h_1 h_2$ pairs, which increase with\nhadron energies. The $K\\pi$ asymmetries are similar to those measured for the\n$\\pi\\pi$ pairs, whereas those measured for high-energy $KK$ pairs are, in\ngeneral, larger.\n", "  The excitons in the orthorhombic phase of the perovskite CH$_3$NH$_3$PbI$_3$\nare studied using the effective mass approximation. The electron-hole\ninteraction is screened by a distance-dependent dielectric function, as\ndescribed by the Haken potential or the Pollmann-B\\\"uttner potential. The\nenergy spectrum and the eigenfunctions are calculated for both cases. The\neffective masses, the low and high frequency dielectric constants, and the\ninterband absorption matrix elements, are obtained from generalized density\nfunctional theory calculations. The results show that the Pollmann-B\\\"uttner\nmodel provides better agreement with the experimental results. The discrete\npart of the exciton spectrum is composed of a fundamental state with a binding\nenergy of 24 meV, and higher states that are within 2 meV from the onset the\nunbound exciton continuum. Light absorption is dominated by the fundamental\nline with an oscillator strength of 0.013, followed by the exciton continuum.\nThe calculations have been performed without fitting any parameter from\nexperiments and are in close agreement with recent experimental results.\n", "  We present F-theories that reduce to 10D Type II Green-Schwarz superstrings.\nThey vary in manifest U-duality according to division between spacetime and\n\"internal\" coordinates. They are defined by selfdual current superalgebras in\nhigher worldvolume dimensions with manifest $\\mathrm G\\times \\mathrm G'$\nsymmetry where the spacetime symmetry $\\mathrm G=\\mathrm E_{n(n)}$ ranges over\nthe (split form of the) exceptional groups with ranks $n=\\mathrm D+1 \\leq 7$\nand the internal symmetry $\\mathrm {G'= GL(10-D)}$.\n", "  Digital signatures are widely used in modern communication to guarantee\nauthenticity and transferability of messages, The security of currently used\nclassical schemes relies on computational assumptions. We present a quantum\nsignature scheme that does not require trusted quantum channels. We prove that\nit is unconditionally secure against the most general coherent attacks, and\nshow that it requires the transmission of significantly fewer quantum states\nthan previous schemes. We also show that the quantum channel noise threshold\nfor our scheme is less strict than for distilling a secure key using quantum\nkey distribution. This shows that direct quantum signature schemes can be\npreferable to signature schemes relying on secret shared keys generated using\nquantum key distribution.\n", "  In this article, we show that eigenenergies and eigenstates of a system\nconsisting of four one-dimensional hard-core particles with masses $6m$, $2m$,\n$m$, and $3m$ in a hard-wall box can be found exactly using Bethe Ansatz. The\nAnsatz is based on the exceptional affine reflection group $\\tilde{F}_{4}$\nassociated with the symmetries and tiling properties of an octacube---a\nPlatonic solid unique to four dimensions, with no three-dimensional analogues.\nWe also uncover the Liouville integrability structure of our problem: the four\nintegrals of motion in involution are identified as invariant polynomials of\nthe finite reflection group $F_{4}$, taken as functions of the components of\nmomenta.\n", "  In this Letter, we show that a three-dimensional Bose-Einstein solitary wave\ncan become stable if the dispersion law is changed from quadratic to quartic.\nWe suggest a way to realize the quartic dispersion, using shaken optical\nlattices. Estimates show that the resulting solitary waves can occupy as little\nas $\\sim 1/20$-th of the Brillouin zone in each of the three directions and\ncontain as many as $N = 10^{3}$ atoms, thus representing a \\textit{fully\nmobile} macroscopic three-dimensional object.\n", "  We study the dynamics of a generalized inflationary model in which both the\nscalar field and its derivatives are coupled to the gravity. We consider a\ngeneral form of the nonminimal derivative coupling in order to have a complete\ntreatment of the model. By expanding the action up to the second order in\nperturbation, we study the spectrum of the primordial modes of the\nperturbations. Also, by expanding the action up to the third order and\nconsidering the three point correlation functions, the amplitude of the\nnon-Gaussianity of the primordial perturbations is studied both in equilateral\nand orthogonal configurations. Finally, by adopting some sort of potentials, we\ncompare the model at hand with the Planck 2015 released observational data and\nobtain some constraints on the model's parameters space. As an important\nresult, we show that the nonminimal couplings help to make models of chaotic\ninflation, that would otherwise be in tension with Planck data, in better\nagreement with the data. This model is consistent with observation at weak\ncoupling limit.\n", "  The first post-classical computation will most probably be performed not on a\nuniversal quantum computer, but rather on a dedicated quantum hardware. A\nstrong candidate for achieving this is represented by the task of sampling from\nthe output distribution of linear quantum optical networks. This problem, known\nas boson sampling, has recently been shown to be intractable for any classical\ncomputer, but it is naturally carried out by running the corresponding\nexperiment. However, only small scale realizations of boson sampling\nexperiments have been demonstrated to date. Their main limitation is related to\nthe non-deterministic state preparation and inefficient measurement step. Here,\nwe propose an alternative setup to implement boson sampling that is based on\nmicrowave photons and not on optical photons. The certified scalability of\nsuperconducting devices indicates that this direction is promising for a\nlarge-scale implementation of boson sampling and allows for more flexible\nfeatures like arbitrary state preparation and efficient photon-number\nmeasurements.\n", "  The stability of Lattice Boltzmann Equations modelling Shallow Water\nEquations in the special case of reduced gravity is investigated theoretically.\nA stability notion is defined as applied in incompressible Navier-Stokes\nequations in Banda, M. K., Yong, W.- A. and Klar, A: A stability notion for\nlattice Boltzmann equations. SIAM J. Sci. Comput. {\\bf 27(6)}, 2098-2111\n(2006). It is found that to maintain stability a careful choice of the value of\nthe reduced gravity must be made. The stability notion is employed to\ninvestigate different shallow water lattice Boltzmann Equations. Results are\ntested using the Lattice Boltzmann Method for various values of the governing\nparameters of the flow. It is observed that even for the discrete model the\nreduced gravity has a significant effect on the stability.\n", "  Starting with the first-order singular Lagrangian containing the redundant\nvariables, the noncommutative quantum mechanics on a curved space is\ninvestigated by the constraint star-product quantization formalism of the\nprojection operator method. Imposing the additional constraints to eliminate\nthe reduntant degrees of freedom, the noncommutative quantum system with\nnoncommutativity among the coordinates on the curved space is exactly\nconstructed. Then, it is shown that the resultant Hamiltonian contains the\nquantum corrections in the exact form. We further discuss the additional\nconstraints to realize the noncommutativities both of coordinates and momenta\non the curved space.\n", "  Creativity, together with the making of ideas into fruition, is essential for\nprogress. Today the evolution from an idea to its application can be\nfacilitated by the implementation of Fabrication Laboratories, or FabLabs,\nhaving affordable digital tools for prototyping. FabLabs aiming at scientific\nresearch and invention are now starting to be established inside Universities,\nResearch Centers and Schools. We review the setting up of the ICTP Scientific\nFabLab in Trieste, Italy, give concrete examples on the use in physics, and\npropose to replicate world-wide this class of multi-purpose workplaces within\nacademia as a support for physics and math education and for community\ndevelopment.\n", "  Superconducting layered transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) stand out\namong other superconductors due to the tunable nature of the superconducting\ntransition, coexistence with other collective electronic excitations (charge\ndensity waves) and strong intrinsic spin-orbit coupling. Molybdenum disulphide\n(MoS2) is the most studied representative of this family of materials,\nespecially since the recent demonstration of the possibility to tune its\ncritical temperature, Tc, by electric-field doping. However, just one of its\npolymorphs, band-insulator 2H-MoS2, has so far been explored for its potential\nto host superconductivity. We have investigated the possibility to induce\nsuperconductivity in metallic polytypes, 1T- and 1T'-MoS2, by potassium (K)\nintercalation. We demonstrate that at doping levels significantly higher than\nthat required to induce superconductivity in 2H-MoS2, both 1T and 1T' phases\nbecome superconducting, with Tc = 2.8 and 4.6K, respectively. Unusually, K\nintercalation in this case is responsible both for the structural and\nsuperconducting phase transitions. By adding new members to the family of\nsuperconducting TMDs our findings open the way to further manipulate and\nenhance the electronic properties of these technologically important materials.\n", "  The $\\Lambda(1405)$ baryon is difficult to detect in experiment, absent in\nmany quark model calculations, and supposedly manifested through a two-pole\nstructure. Its uncommon properties made it subject to numerous experimental and\ntheoretical studies in recent years. Lattice-QCD eigenvalues for different\nquark masses were recently reported by the Adelaide group. We compare these\neigenvalues to predictions of a model based on Unitary Chiral Perturbation\nTheory. The UCHPT calculation predicts the quark mass dependence remarkably\nwell. It also explains the overlap pattern with different meson-baryon\ncomponents, mainly $\\pi\\Sigma$ and $\\bar KN$, at different quark masses. More\naccurate lattice QCD data are required to draw definite conclusions on the\nnature of the $\\Lambda(1405)$.\n", "  We study the non-equilibrium dynamics obtained by an abrupt change (a {\\em\nquench}) in the parameters of an integrable classical field theory, the\nnonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation. We first consider explicit one-soliton\nexamples, which we fully describe by solving the direct part of the inverse\nscattering problem. We then develop some aspects of the general theory using\nelements of the inverse scattering method. For this purpose, we introduce the\n{\\em quench map} which acts on the space of scattering data and represents the\nchange of parameter with fixed field configuration (initial condition). We\ndescribe some of its analytic properties by implementing a higher level version\nof the inverse scattering method, and we discuss the applications of\nDarboux-B\\\"acklund transformations, Gelfand-Levitan-Marchenko equations and the\nRosales series solution to a related, dual quench problem. Finally, we comment\non the interplay between quantum and classical tools around the theme of\nquenches and on the usefulness of the quantization of our classical approach to\nthe quantum quench problem.\n", "  Beam energy scan programs in heavy-ion collisions aim to explore the QCD\nphase structure at high baryon density. Sensitive observables are applied to\nprobe the signatures of the QCD phase transition and critical point in\nheavy-ion collisions at RHIC and SPS. Intriguing structures, such as dip, peak\nand oscillation, have been observed in the energy dependence of various\nobservables. In this paper, an overview is given and corresponding physics\nimplications will be discussed for the experimental highlights from the beam\nenergy scan programs at the STAR, PHENIX and NA61/SHINE experiments.\nFurthermore, the beam energy scan phase II at RHIC (2019-2020) and other future\nexperimental facilities for studying the physics at low energies will be also\ndiscussed.\n", "  To optimize the interaction between chiral matter and highly twisted light,\nquantities that can help characterize chiral electromagnetic fields near\nnanostructures are needed. Here, by analogy with Poynting's theorem, we\nformulate the time-averaged conservation law of optical chirality in lossy\ndispersive media and identify the optical chirality flux as an ideal far-field\nobservable for characterizing chiral optical near fields. Bounded by the\nconservation law, we show that it provides precise information, unavailable\nfrom circular dichroism spectroscopy, on the magnitude and handedness of highly\ntwisted fields near nanostructures.\n", "  Electromagnetism is a \\textit{relativistic} theory and one must exercise care\nin coupling this theory with \\textit{nonrelativistic} classical mechanics and\nwith \\textit{nonrelativistic} classical statistical mechanics. Indeed\nhistorically, both the blackbody radiation spectrum and diamagnetism within\nclassical theory have been misunderstood because of two crucial failures: 1)the\nneglect of classical electromagnetic zero-point radiation, and 2) the use of\nerroneous combinations of nonrelativistic mechanics with relativistic\nelectrodynamics. Here we review the treatment of classical blackbody radiation,\nand show that use of Lorentz-invariant classical electromagnetic zero-point\nradiation can be used to explain both the Planck blackbody spectrum and Landau\ndiamagnetism at thermal equilibrium within classical electromagnetic theory.\nThe analysis requires that relativistic electromagnetism is joined\nappropriately with simple nonrelativistic mechanical systems which can be\nregarded as the zero-velocity limits of relativistic systems, and that\nnonrelativistic classical statistical mechanics is applied only in the\nlow-frequency limit when zero-point energy makes no contribution.\n", "  Newton's theorem of revolving orbits states that one can multiply the angular\nspeed of a Keplerian orbit by a factor $k$ by applying a radial inverse cubed\nforce proportional to $(1-k^2)$. In this paper we derive an extension of this\ntheorem in general relativity, valid for the motion of massive particles in any\nstatic, spherically symmetric metrics. We verify the Newtonian limit of this\nextension and demonstrate that there is no such generalization for rotating\nmetrics. Further we also extend the theory to the case of charged particles in\nthe Einstein-Maxwell and Kaluza-Klein theories.\n", "  We report on the measurement of $\\rm{J}/\\psi$ production in the dielectron\nchannel at mid-rapidity (|y|<1) in p+p and d+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ =\n200 GeV from the STAR experiment at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider. The\ntransverse momentum $p_{T}$ spectra in p+p for $p_{T}$ < 4 GeV/c and d+Au\ncollisions for $p_{T}$ < 3 GeV/c are presented. These measurements extend the\nSTAR coverage for $\\rm{J}/\\psi$ production in p+p collisions to low $p_{T}$.\nThe $<p_{T}^{2}>$ from the measured $\\rm{J}/\\psi$ invariant cross section in\np+p and d+Au collisions are evaluated and compared to similar measurements at\nother collision energies. The nuclear modification factor for $\\rm{J}/\\psi$ is\nextracted as a function of $p_{T}$ and collision centrality in d+Au and\ncompared to model calculations using the modified nuclear Parton Distribution\nFunction and a final-state $\\rm{J}/\\psi$ nuclear absorption cross section.\n", "  Symmetries play an interesting role in cosmology. They are useful in\ncharacterizing the cosmological perturbations generated during inflation and\nlead to consistency relations involving the soft limit of the statistical\ncorrelators of large-scale structure dark matter and galaxies overdensities. On\nthe other hand, in observational cosmology the carriers of the information\nabout these large-scale statistical distributions are light rays traveling on\nnull geodesics. Motivated by this simple consideration, we study the structure\nof null infinity and the associated BMS symmetry in a cosmological setting. For\ndecelerating Friedmann-Robertson-Walker backgrounds, for which future null\ninfinity exists, we find that the BMS transformations which leaves the\nasymptotic metric invariant to leading order. Contrary to the asymptotic flat\ncase, the BMS transformations in cosmology generate Goldstone modes\ncorresponding to both scalar and tensor degrees of freedom which may exist at\nnull infinity and perturb the asymptotic data. Therefore, BMS transformations\ngenerate physically inequivalent vacua as they populate the universe at null\ninfinity with these physical degrees of freedom. We also discuss the\ngravitational memory effect when cosmological expansion is taken into account.\nIn this case, there are extra contribution to the gravitational memory due to\nthe tail of the retarded Green functions which are supported not only on the\nlight-cone, but also in its interior. The gravitational memory effect can be\nunderstood also from an asymptotic point of view as a transition among\ncosmological BMS-related vacua.\n", "  We study the critical properties of finite-dimensional dissipative quantum\nspin systems with uniform ferromagnetic interactions. Starting from the\ntransverse-field Ising model coupled to a bath of harmonic oscillators with\nOhmic spectral density, we generalize its classical representation to classical\nspin systems with $O(n)$ symmetry and then take the large-$n$ limit to reduce\nthe system to the spherical model. The exact solution to the resulting\nspherical model with long-range interactions along the imaginary-time axis\nshows a phase transition with static critical exponents coinciding with those\nof the conventional short-range spherical model in $d+2$ dimensions, where $d$\nis the spatial dimensionality of the original quantum system. This implies the\ndynamical exponent to be $z=2$. These conclusions are consistent with the\nresults of Monte Carlo simulations and renormalization group calculations for\ndissipative transverse-field Ising and $O(n)$ models in one and two dimensions.\nThe present approach therefore serves as a useful tool to analytically\ninvestigate the properties of quantum phase transitions of the dissipative\ntransverse-field Ising and related models. Our method may also offer a platform\nto study more complex phase transitions in dissipative finite-dimensional\nquantum spin systems, which recently receive renewed interest under the context\nof quantum annealing in a noisy environment.\n", "  We present a new-generation tool to model and interpret spectral energy\ndistributions (SEDs) of galaxies, which incorporates in a consistent way the\nproduction of radiation and its transfer through the interstellar and\nintergalactic media. This flexible tool, named BEAGLE (for BayEsian Analysis of\nGaLaxy sEds), allows one to build mock galaxy catalogues as well as to\ninterpret any combination of photometric and spectroscopic galaxy observations\nin terms of physical parameters. The current version of the tool includes\nversatile modeling of the emission from stars and photoionized gas, attenuation\nby dust and accounting for different instrumental effects, such as\nspectroscopic flux calibration and line spread function. We show a first\napplication of the BEAGLE tool to the interpretation of broadband SEDs of a\npublished sample of ${\\sim}10^4$ galaxies at redshifts $0.1 \\lesssim\nz\\lesssim8$. We find that the constraints derived on photometric redshifts\nusing this multi-purpose tool are comparable to those obtained using public,\ndedicated photometric-redshift codes and quantify this result in a rigorous\nstatistical way. We also show how the post-processing of BEAGLE output data\nwith the Python extension PYP-BEAGLE allows the characterization of systematic\ndeviations between models and observations, in particular through posterior\npredictive checks. The modular design of the BEAGLE tool allows easy extensions\nto incorporate, for example, the absorption by neutral galactic and\ncircumgalactic gas, and the emission from an active galactic nucleus, dust and\nshock-ionized gas. Information about public releases of the BEAGLE tool will be\nmaintained on http://www.jacopochevallard.org/beagle.\n", "  We report an investigation of temperature and IrMn layered thickness\ndependence of anomalous-Hall resistance (AHR), anisotropic magnetoresistance\n(AMR), and magnetization on Pt/Ir20Mn80/Y3Fe5O12 (Pt/IrMn/YIG)\nheterostructures. The magnitude of AHR is dramatically enhanced compared with\nPt/YIG bilayers. The enhancement is much more profound at higher temperatures\nand peaks at the IrMn thickness of 3 nm. The observed spin-Hall\nmagnetoresistance (SMR) in the temperature range of 10-300 K indicates that the\nspin current generated in the Pt layer can penetrate the entire thickness of\nthe IrMn layer to interact with the YIG layer. The lack of conventional\nanisotropic magnetoresistance (CAMR) implies that the insertion of the IrMn\nlayer between Pt and YIG efficiently suppresses the magnetic proximity effect\n(MPE) on induced Pt moments by YIG. Our results suggest that the dual roles of\nthe InMn insertion in Pt/IrMn/YIG heterostructures are to block the MPE and to\ntransport the spin current between Pt and YIG layers. We discuss possible\nmechanisms for the enhanced AHR.\n", "  This paper describes a new approach for learning from homework, called\nPeer-Assisted Reflection (PAR). PAR involves students using peer feedback to\nimprove their work on open-ended homework problems. Collaborating with peers\nand revising one's work based on the feedback of others are important aspects\nof doing and learning physics. While notable exceptions exist, homework and\nexams are generally individual activities that do not support collaboration and\nrefinement, which misses important opportunities to use assessment for\nlearning. In contrast, PAR provides students with a structure to iteratively\nengage with challenging, open-ended problems and solicit the input of their\npeers to improve their work.\n", "  In this paper the optimal control of alignment models composed by a large\nnumber of agents is investigated in presence of a selective action of a\ncontroller, acting in order to enhance consensus. Two types of selective\ncontrols have been presented: an homogeneous control filtered by a selective\nfunction and a distributed control active only on a selective set. As a first\nstep toward a reduction of computational cost, we introduce a model predictive\ncontrol (MPC) approximation by deriving a numerical scheme with a feedback\nselective constrained dynamics. Next, in order to cope with the numerical\nsolution of a large number of interacting agents, we derive the mean-field\nlimit of the feedback selective constrained dynamics, which eventually will be\nsolved numerically by means of a stochastic algorithm, able to simulate\nefficiently the selective constrained dynamics. Finally, several numerical\nsimulations are reported to show the efficiency of the proposed techniques.\n", "  Trapped substances between a 2D crystal, such as graphene, and an atomically\nflat substrate, for example, hexagonal boron nitride, give rise to the\nformation of bubbles. We show that the size, shape and internal pressure inside\nthese bubbles are determined by the competition between van der Waals\nattraction of a 2D crystal to the substrate and the elastic energy needed to\ndeform the atomically thin layer. This presents opportunities to use bubbles to\nstudy the elasticity of 2D materials as well as the conditions of confinement,\nyet none of these have been explored so far, either theoretically or\nexperimentally. We have created a variety of bubbles formed by monolayers of\ngraphene, hBN and MoS2 mechanically exfoliated onto hBN, graphite and MoS2\nsubstrates. Their shapes, analyzed using atomic force microscopy, are found to\nexhibit universal scaling with well-defined aspect ratios, in agreement with\ntheoretical analysis based on general properties of membranes. We also measured\nthe pressure induced by the confinement, which increased with decreasing\nbubble's size and reached tens on MPa inside submicron bubbles. This agrees\nwith our theory estimates and suggests that for bubbles with radii < 10 nm\nhydrostatic pressures can reach close to 1 GPa, which may modify the properties\nof a trapped material.\n", "  We extend the string field theory of 2D generalized causal dynamical\ntriangulation (GCDT) with the Ishibashi-Kawai type (IK-type) interaction\nformulated by the matrix model to the 3D model of the surface field theory.\nBased on the loop gas model, we construct a tensor model for the discretized\nsurface field and then apply it the stochastic quantization method. In the\ndouble-scaling limit, the model is characterized by two scaling dimensions $D$\nand $D_N$, the power indices of the minimal length as the scaling parameter.\nThe continuum GCDT model with the IK-type interaction is realized with a\nsimilar restriction in the $D_N$-$D$ space to the 2D model. The distinct\nproperty in the 3D model is that the quantum effect contains the IK-type\ninteraction only, while the ordinary splitting interaction is excluded.\n", "  For the better part of a century the field of nuclear astrophysics has aimed\nto answer fundamental questions about nature, such as the origin of the\nelements and the behavior of high-density, low-temperature matter. Sustained\nand concerted efforts in nuclear experiment have been key to achieving progress\nin these areas and will continue to be so. Here I will briefly review recent\naccomplishments and open questions in experimental nuclear astrophysics.\n", "  A view on the physical meaning of the so called ergodic hypothesis: its role\non the foundations of equilibrium statistical mechanics in mid '800, its\ninterpretations and hints at its relevance for modern nonequilibrium\nstatistical mechanics. Followed by appendices with detailed comments on the\noriginal papers.\n", "  We report a new method of using the plasma time difference, which results\nfrom the plasma effect, between the nuclear and electronic recoil events in\nhigh-purity germanium detectors to distinguish these two types of events in the\nsearch for rare physics processes. The physics mechanism of the plasma effect\nis discussed in detail. A numerical model is developed to calculate the plasma\ntime for nuclear and electronic recoils at various energies in germanium\ndetectors. It can be shown that under certain conditions the plasma time\ndifference is large enough to be observable. The experimental aspects in\nrealizing such a discrimination in germanium detectors is discussed.\n", "  We study the probability distribution $\\mathcal{P}(H,t,L)$ of the surface\nheight $h(x=0,t)=H$ in the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation in $1+1$\ndimension when starting from a parabolic interface, $h(x,t=0)=x^2/L$. The\nlimits of $L\\to\\infty$ and $L\\to 0$ have been recently solved exactly for any\n$t>0$. Here we address the early-time behavior of $\\mathcal{P}(H,t,L)$ for\ngeneral $L$. We employ the weak-noise theory - a variant of WKB approximation\n-- which yields the optimal history of the interface, conditioned on reaching\nthe given height $H$ at the origin at time $t$. We find that at small $H$\n$\\mathcal{P}(H,t,L)$ is Gaussian, but its tails are non-Gaussian and highly\nasymmetric. In the leading order and in a proper moving frame, the tails behave\nas $-\\ln \\mathcal{P}= f_{+}|H|^{5/2}/t^{1/2}$ and $f_{-}|H|^{3/2}/t^{1/2}$. The\nfactor $f_{+}(L,t)$ monotonically increases as a function of $L$, interpolating\nbetween time-independent values at $L=0$ and $L=\\infty$ that were previously\nknown. The factor $f_{-}$ is independent of $L$ and $t$, signalling\nuniversality of this tail for a whole class of deterministic initial\nconditions.\n", "  Particle dynamics in the electron current layer in collisionless magnetic\nreconnection is investigated by using a particle-in-cell simulation. Electron\nmotion and velocity distribution functions are studied by tracking\nself-consistent trajectories. New classes of electron orbits are discovered:\nfigure-eight-shaped regular orbits inside the electron jet, noncrossing regular\norbits on the jet flanks, noncrossing Speiser orbits, and nongyrotropic\nelectrons in the downstream of the jet termination region. Properties of a\nsuper-Alfv\\'{e}nic outflow jet are attributed to an ensemble of electrons\ntraveling through Speiser orbits. Noncrossing orbits are mediated by the\npolarization electric field near the electron current layer. The noncrossing\nelectrons are found to be non-negligible in number density. The impact of these\nnew orbits to electron mixing, spatial distribution of energetic electrons, and\nobservational signatures, is presented.\n", "  We study anisotropic inflation with Gauss-Bonnet correction in presence of a\nmassless vector field. In this scenario, exact anisotropic power-law inflation\nis realized when the inflaton potential, gauge coupling function and the\nGauss-Bonnet coupling are exponential functions. We show that anisotropy\nbecomes proportional to two slow-roll parameters of the theory and hence gets\nenhanced in presence of quadratic curvature corrections. The stability analysis\nreveals that anisotropic power-law solutions remain stable over a substantially\nlarge parameter region.\n", "  We present ALMA band 7 (345 GHz) continuum and $^{12}$CO(J = 3-2)\nobservations of the circumstellar disk surrounding HD141569. At an age of about\n5 Myr, the disk has a complex morphology that may be best interpreted as a\nnascent debris system with gas. Our $870\\rm~\\mu m$ ALMA continuum observations\nresolve a dust disk out to approximately $ 56 ~\\rm au$ from the star (assuming\na distance of 116 pc) with $0.\"38$ resolution and $0.07 ~ \\rm mJy~beam^{-1}$\nsensitivity. We measure a continuum flux density for this inner material of\n$3.8 \\pm 0.4 ~ \\rm mJy$ (including calibration uncertainties). The\n$^{12}$CO(3-2) gas is resolved kinematically and spatially from about 30 to 210\nau. The integrated $^{12}$CO(3-2) line flux density is $15.7 \\pm 1.6~\\rm\nJy~km~s^{-1}$. We estimate the mass of the millimeter debris and $^{12}$CO(3-2)\ngas to be $\\gtrsim0.04~\\rm M_{\\oplus}$ and $\\sim2\\times 10^{-3}~\\rm\nM_{\\oplus}$, respectively. If the millimeter grains are part of a collisional\ncascade, then we infer that the inner disk ($<50$ au) has $\\sim 160~\\rm\nM_{\\oplus}$ contained within objects less than 50 km in radius, depending on\nthe planetesimal size distribution and density assumptions. MCMC modeling of\nthe system reveals a disk morphology with an inclination of $53.4^{\\circ}$\ncentered around a $\\rm M=2.39~ M_{\\odot}$ host star ($\\rm Msin(i)=1.92~\nM_{\\odot}$). We discuss whether the gas in HD141569's disk may be second\ngeneration. If it is, the system can be used to study the clearing stages of\nplanet formation.\n", "  Ultrafast two-dimensional spectroscopy utilizes correlated multiple\nlight-matter interactions for retrieving dynamic features that may otherwise be\nhidden under the linear spectrum. Its extension to the terahertz regime of the\nelectromagnetic spectrum, where a rich variety of material degrees of freedom\nreside, remains an experimental challenge. Here we report ultrafast\ntwo-dimensional terahertz spectroscopy of gas-phase molecular rotors at room\ntemperature. Using time-delayed terahertz pulse pairs, we observe photon echoes\nand other nonlinear signals resulting from molecular dipole orientation induced\nby three terahertz field-dipole interactions. The nonlinear time-domain\norientation signals are mapped into the frequency domain in two-dimensional\nrotational spectra which reveal J-state-resolved nonlinear rotational dynamics.\nThe approach enables direct observation of correlated rotational transitions\nand may reveal rotational coupling and relaxation pathways in the ground\nelectronic and vibrational state.\n", "  Gravitational Waves (GW) have now been detected from stellar-mass black hole\nbinaries, and the first observations of GW from Massive Black Hole (MBH)\nBinaries are expected within the next decade. Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTA), which\ncan measure the years long periods of GW from MBHB, have excluded many standard\npredictions for the amplitude of a stochastic GW Background (GWB). We use\ncoevolved populations of MBH and galaxies from hydrodynamic, cosmological\nsimulations ('Illustris') to calculate a predicted GWB. The most advanced\npredictions so far have included binary hardening mechanisms from individual\nenvironmental processes. We present the first calculation including all of the\nenvironmental mechanisms expected to be involved: dynamical friction, stellar\n'loss-cone' scattering, and viscous drag from a circumbinary disk. We find that\nMBH binary lifetimes are generally multiple gigayears, and only a fraction\ncoalesce by redshift zero. For a variety of parameters, we find all GWB\namplitudes to be below the most stringent PTA upper limit of\n$A_{\\textrm{yr}^{-1}} \\approx 10^{-15}$. Our fairly conservative fiducial model\npredicts an amplitude of $A_{\\textrm{yr}^{-1}} \\approx 0.4\\times\n10^{-15}$---less than a factor of three below the current limit. At lower\nfrequencies, we find $A_{0.1\\,\\textrm{yr}^{-1}} \\approx 1.5\\times 10^{-15}$\nwith spectral indices between $-0.4$ and $-0.6$---significantly flatter than\nthe canonical value of $-2/3$ due to purely GW-driven evolution. Typical MBHB\ndriving the GWB signal come from redshifts around $0.3$, with total masses of a\nfew times $10^9\\,M_\\odot$, and in host galaxies with very large stellar masses.\nEven without GWB detections, our results can be connected to observations of\ndual AGN to constrain binary evolution.\n", "  In this paper, we show that a higher derivative theory, such as New Massive\nGravity, allows the existence of new entangling surfaces with non-zero\nextrinsic curvature. We perform the analysis for Lifshitz and Warped $AdS$\nspace times, revealing the role of the higher derivative contributions in the\ncalculation of the holographic entanglement entropy. Finally, as an outcome of\nour holographic analysis we briefly comment on the dual boundary theory.\n", "  The Horava theory depends on several coupling constants. The kinetic term of\nits Lagrangian depends on one dimensionless coupling constant lambda. For the\nparticular value lambda = 1/3 the kinetic term becomes conformal invariant,\nalthough the full Lagrangian does not have this symmetry. For any value of\nlambda the nonprojectable version of the theory has second-class constraints\nwhich play a central role in the process of quantization. Here we study the\ncomplete nonprojectable theory, including the Blas-Pujolas-Sibiryakov\ninteracting terms, at the kinetic-conformal point lambda = 1/3. The generic\ncounting of degrees of freedom indicates that this theory propagates the same\nphysical degrees of freedom of General Relativity. We analyze this point\nrigorously taking into account all the z=1,2,3 terms that contribute to the\naction describing quadratic perturbations around the Minkowski spacetime. We\nshow that the constraints of the theory and equations determining the Lagrange\nmultipliers are strongly elliptic partial differential equations, an essential\ncondition for a constrained phase-space structure in field theory. We show how\ntheir solutions lead to the two independent tensorial physical modes propagated\nby the theory. We also obtain the reduced Hamiltonian. These arguments\nstrengthen the consistency of the theory. We find the restrictions on the space\nof coupling constants to ensure the positiveness of the reduced Hamiltonian. We\nobtain the propagator of the physical modes, showing that there are not ghosts\nand that the propagator effectively acquires the z=3 scaling for all physical\ndegrees of freedom at the high energy regime. By evaluating the superficial\ndegree of divergence, taking into account the second-class constraints, we show\nthat the theory is power-counting renormalizable. ...\n", "  We apply the Matrix Product Ansatz to study the Totally Asymmetric Simple\nExclusion Process on a ring with a generalized discrete-time dynamics depending\non two hopping probabilities, $p$ and $\\tilde{p}$. The model contains as\nspecial cases the TASEP with parallel update, when $\\tilde{p} =0$, and with\nsequential backward-ordered update, when $\\tilde{p} =p$.\n  We construct a two-dimensional matrix-product representation and use it to\nobtain exact finite-size expressions for the partition function, the current of\nparticles and the two-point correlation function. Our main new result is the\nderivation of the finite-size pair correlation function. Its behavior is\nanalyzed in different regimes of effective attraction and repulsion between the\nparticles, depending on whether $\\tilde{p} >p$ or $\\tilde{p} < p$. In\nparticular, we explicitly obtain an analytic expression for the pair\ncorrelation function in the limit of irreversible aggregation\n$\\tilde{p}\\rightarrow 1$, when the stationary configurations contain just one\ncluster.\n", "  In this work, we present a trinification-based grand unified theory\nincorporating a global $\\mathrm{SU}(3)$ family symmetry that after a\nspontaneous breaking leads to a left-right symmetric model. Already at the\nclassical level, this model can accommodate the matter content and the quark\nCabbibo mixing in the Standard Model (SM) with only one Yukawa coupling at the\nunification scale. Considering the minimal low-energy scenario with the least\namount of light states, we show that the resulting effective theory enables\ndynamical breaking of its gauge group down to that of the SM by means of\nradiative corrections accounted for by the renormalisation group evolution at\none loop. This result paves the way for a consistent explanation of the SM\nbreaking scale and fermion mass hierarchies.\n", "  We present a useful function for describing the profiles of dark-matter\nhaloes with a varying asymptotic inner slope -\\alpha, ranging from a cusp to a\ncore, where the profiles of density, mass-velocity and potential are simple\nanalytic expressions for any \\alpha. The idea is to express the mean-density\nprofile as a simple functional form, and obtain the local density by\nderivative. The model involves a concentration parameter c analogous to the NFW\nprofile. More flexibility is provided by a sum of two such functions, with\nconcentrations c_1 and c_2. An optional additional parameter is the asymptotic\nouter slope -\\gamma, which allows more flexibility in the outskirts of haloes.\nFor \\gamma different than 3, there are analytic expressions for the profiles of\ndensity and mass-velocity but not for the potential. We match the proposed\nfunction, in different variants, to the dark-matter profiles of haloes in\ncosmological simulations, with and without baryons, spanning inner profiles\nthat range from steep cusps to flat cores, and find excellent fits. The\nanalytic potential profile is useful in modeling the evolution of the inner\nhalo due to episodes of gas inflow and outflow. The analytic profile,\nespecially with a free \\gamma, is useful for a study of environmental effects\nin the outer halo. In general, these analytic profiles can serve for\nstraightforwardly quantifying the shapes of simulated and observed rotation\ncurves, without the need for numerical integrations.\n", "  In this work, we present a consistent Hamiltonian analysis of cosmological\nperturbations for generalized non-canonical scalar fields. In order to do so,\nwe introduce a new phase-space variable that is uniquely defined for different\nnon-canonical scalar fields. We also show that this is the simplest and\nefficient way of expressing the Hamiltonian. We extend the Hamiltonian approach\nof [arXiv:1512.02539] to non-canonical scalar field and obtain a new definition\nof speed of sound in phase-space. In order to invert generalized phase-space\nHamilton's equations to Euler-Lagrange equations of motion, we prescribe a\ngeneral inversion formulae and show that our approach for non-canonical scalar\nfield is consistent. We also obtain the third and fourth order interaction\nHamiltonian for generalized non-canonical scalar fields and briefly discuss the\nextension of our method to generalized Galilean scalar fields.\n", "  Based on the already existing analytical theory of the strongly-nonlinear\nwakefield (which is called \"bubble\") in transversely inhomogeneous plasmas, we\nstudy particular behavior of non-loaded (empty) bubbles and bubbles with\naccelerated bunches. We obtain an analytical expression for the shape of a\nnon-loaded bubble in a general case and verify it with particle-in-cell (PIC)\nsimulations. We derive a method of calculation of the acceleration efficiency\nfor arbitrary accelerated bunches. The influence of flat-top electron bunches\non the shape of a bubble is studied. It is also shown that it is possible to\nachieve acceleration in a homogeneous longitudinal electric field by the\nadjustment of the longitudinal density profile of the accelerated electron\nbunch. The predictions of the model are verified by 3D PIC simulations and are\nin a good agreement with them.\n", "  The embedding of a given point set with non-crystallographic symmetry into\nhigher-dimensional space is reviewed, with special emphasis on the Minkowski\nembedding known from number theory. This is a natural choice that does not\nrequire an a priori construction of a lattice in relation to a given symmetry\ngroup. Instead, some elementary properties of the point set in physical space\nare used, and explicit methods are described. This approach works particularly\nwell for the standard symmetries encountered in the practical study of\nquasicrystalline phases. We also demonstrate this with a recent experimental\nexample, taken from a sample with square-triangle tiling structure and\n(approximate) twelvefold symmetry.\n", "  We develop an effective medium model of thermal conductivity that accounts\nfor both percolation and interface scattering. This model accurately explains\nthe measured increase and decrease of thermal conductivity with loading in\ncomposites dominated by percolation and interface scattering, respectively. Our\nmodel further predicts that strong interface scattering leads to a sharp\ndecrease in thermal conductivity, or an insulator transition, at high loadings\nwhen conduction through the matrix is restricted and heat is forced to diffuse\nthrough particles with large interface resistance. The accuracy of our model\nand its ability to predict transitions between insulating and conducting states\nsuggest it can be a useful tool for designing materials with low or high\nthermal conductivity for a variety of applications.\n", "  We consider a two-dimensional (2D) two-component spinor system with cubic\nattraction between the components and intra-species self-repulsion, which may\nbe realized in atomic Bose-Einstein condensates, as well as in a\nquasi-equilibrium condensate of microcavity polaritons. Including a 2D\nspatially periodic potential, which is necessary for the stabilization of the\nsystem against the critical collapse, we use detailed numerical calculations\nand an analytical variational approximation (VA) to predict the existence and\nstability of several types of 2D symbiotic solitons in the spinor system.\nStability ranges are found for symmetric and asymmetric symbiotic fundamental\nsolitons and vortices, including hidden-vorticity (HV) modes, with opposite\nvorticities in the two components. The VA produces exceptionally accurate\npredictions for the fundamental solitons and vortices. The fundamental\nsolitons, both symmetric and asymmetric ones, are completely stable, in either\ncase when they exist as gap solitons or regular ones. The symmetric and\nasymmetric vortices are stable if the inter-component attraction is stronger\nthan the intra-species repulsion, while the HV modes have their stability\nregion in the opposite case.\n", "  The magnetic skyrmion structure can be formed in the chiral magnets (CMs)\nwith strong Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions. In this work, we propose a way\nof artificially tailoring the topological details of the skyrmion such as its\nradial and whirling symmetric patterns by external magnetic fields besieging\nthe CM slab. As long as the boundary magnetic fields are strong enough to fix\nthe boundary ferromagnetism, the attained skyrmion profile is stable over time.\nThe dynamics of spins is considered by numerically solving the non-equilibrium\nLandau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation.\n", "  We study two-field bouncing cosmologies in which primordial perturbations are\ncreated in either an ekpyrotic or a matter-dominated contraction phase. We use\na non-singular ghost condensate bounce model to follow the perturbations\nthrough the bounce into the expanding phase of the universe. In contrast to the\nadiabatic perturbations, which on large scales are conserved across the bounce,\nentropy perturbations can grow significantly during the bounce phase. If they\nare converted into adiabatic/curvature perturbations after the bounce, they\ntypically form the dominant contribution to the observed temperature\nfluctuations in the microwave background, which can have several beneficial\nimplications. For ekpyrotic models, this mechanism loosens the constraints on\nthe amplitude of the ekpyrotic potential while naturally suppressing the\nintrinsic amount of non-Gaussianity. For matter bounce models, the mechanism\namplifies the scalar perturbations compared to the associated primordial\ngravitational waves.\n", "  Under the existence of chiral non-Gaussian sources during inflation, the\ntrispectrum of primordial curvature perturbations can break parity. We examine\nsignatures of the induced trispectrum of the cosmic microwave background (CMB)\nanisotropies. It is confirmed via a harmonic-space analysis that, as a\nconsequence of parity violation, such a CMB trispectrum has nonvanishing signal\nin the $\\ell_1 + \\ell_2 + \\ell_3 + \\ell_4 = \\text{odd}$ domain, which is\nprohibited in the concordance cosmology. When the curvature trispectrum is\nparametrized with Legendre polynomials, the CMB signal due to the Legendre\ndipolar term is enhanced at the squeezed configurations in $\\ell$ space,\nyielding a high signal-to-noise ratio. A Fisher matrix computation results in a\nminimum detectable size of the dipolar coefficient in a\ncosmic-variance-limited-level temperature survey as $d_1^{\\rm odd} = 640$. In\nan inflationary model where the inflaton field couples to the gauge field via\nan $f(\\phi)(F^2 + F\\tilde{F})$ interaction, the curvature trispectrum contains\nsuch a parity-odd dipolar term. We find that, in this model, the CMB\ntrispectrum yields a high signal-to-noise ratio compared with the CMB power\nspectrum or bispectrum. Therefore, the $\\ell_1 + \\ell_2 + \\ell_3 + \\ell_4 =\n\\text{odd}$ signal could be a promising observable of cosmological parity\nviolation.\n", "  Symmetrization of topologically ordered wavefunctions is a powerful method\nfor constructing new topological models. Here, we study wavefunctions obtained\nby symmetrizing quantum double models of a group $G$ in the Projected Entangled\nPair States (PEPS) formalism. We show that symmetrization naturally gives rise\nto a larger symmetry group $\\tilde G$ which is always non-abelian. We prove\nthat by symmetrizing on sufficiently large blocks, one can always construct\nwavefunctions in the same phase as the double model of $\\tilde G$. In order to\nunderstand the effect of symmetrization on smaller patches, we carry out\nnumerical studies for the toric code model, where we find strong evidence that\nsymmetrizing on individual spins gives rise to a critical model which is at the\nphase transitions of two inequivalent toric codes, obtained by anyon\ncondensation from the double model of $\\tilde G$.\n", "  We consider the most general correlations that can be obtained by a group of\nparties whose causal relations are well-defined, although possibly\nprobabilistic and dependent on past parties' operations. We show that, for any\nfixed number of parties and inputs and outputs for each party, the set of such\ncorrelations forms a convex polytope, whose vertices correspond to\ndeterministic strategies, and whose (nontrivial) facets define so-called causal\ninequalities. We completely characterize the simplest tripartite polytope in\nterms of its facet inequalities, propose generalizations of some inequalities\nto scenarios with more parties, and show that our tripartite inequalities can\nbe violated within the process matrix formalism, where quantum mechanics is\nlocally valid but no global causal structure is assumed.\n", "  Beauty baryons are being observed in large numbers in the LHCb detector. The\nrich kinematic distributions of their multibody decays are therefore becoming\naccessible and provide us with new opportunities to search for CP violation. We\nanalyse the angular distributions of some three- and four-body decays of\nspin-$1/2$ baryons using the Jacob-Wick helicity formalism. The asymmetries\nthat provide access to small differences of CP-odd phases between decay\namplitudes of identical CP-even phases are notably discussed. The understanding\ngained on processes featuring specific resonant intermediate states allows us\nto establish which asymmetries are relevant for what purpose. It is for\ninstance shown that some CP-odd angular asymmetries measured by the LHCb\ncollaboration in the $\\Lambda_b \\to \\Lambda\\,\\varphi \\to p\\,\\pi\\, K^+ K^-$\ndecay are expected to vanish identically.\n", "  A light yield of 20.4 $\\pm$ 0.8 photoelectrons/keV was achieved with an\nundoped CsI crystal coupled directly to a photomultiplier tube at 77 Kelvin.\nThis is by far the largest yield in the world achieved with CsI crystals. An\nenergy threshold that is several times lower than the current dark matter\nexperiments utilizing CsI(Tl) crystals may be achievable using this technique.\nTogether with novel CsI crystal purification methods, the technique may be used\nto improve the sensitivities of dark matter and coherent elastic\nneutrino-nucleus scattering experiments. Also measured were the scintillation\nlight decay constants of the undoped CsI crystal at both room temperature and\n77 Kelvin. The results are consistent with those in the literature.\n", "  Photometric measurements are prone to systematic errors presenting a\nchallenge to low-amplitude variability detection. In search for a\ngeneral-purpose variability detection technique able to recover a broad range\nof variability types including currently unknown ones, we test 18 statistical\ncharacteristics quantifying scatter and/or correlation between brightness\nmeasurements. We compare their performance in identifying variable objects in\nseven time series data sets obtained with telescopes ranging in size from a\ntelephoto lens to 1m-class and probing variability on time-scales from minutes\nto decades. The test data sets together include lightcurves of 127539 objects,\namong them 1251 variable stars of various types and represent a range of\nobserving conditions often found in ground-based variability surveys. The real\ndata are complemented by simulations. We propose a combination of two indices\nthat together recover a broad range of variability types from photometric data\ncharacterized by a wide variety of sampling patterns, photometric accuracies,\nand percentages of outlier measurements. The first index is the interquartile\nrange (IQR) of magnitude measurements, sensitive to variability irrespective of\na time-scale and resistant to outliers. It can be complemented by the ratio of\nthe lightcurve variance to the mean square successive difference, 1/h, which is\nefficient in detecting variability on time-scales longer than the typical time\ninterval between observations. Variable objects have larger 1/h and/or IQR\nvalues than non-variable objects of similar brightness. Another approach to\nvariability detection is to combine many variability indices using principal\ncomponent analysis. We present 124 previously unknown variable stars found in\nthe test data.\n", "  Star formation within the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) may be intimately\nlinked to the orbital dynamics of the gas. Recent models suggest that star\nformation within the dust ridge molecular clouds (from G0.253+0.016 to Sgr B2)\nfollows an evolutionary time sequence, triggered by tidal compression during\ntheir preceding pericentre passage. Given that these clouds are the most likely\nprecursors to a generation of massive stars and extreme star clusters, this\nscenario would have profound implications for constraining the time-evolution\nof star formation. In this Letter, we search for the initial conditions of the\nprotocluster clouds, focusing on the kinematics of gas situated upstream from\npericentre. We observe a highly-regular corrugated velocity field in\n$\\{l,\\,v_{\\rm LSR}\\}$ space, with amplitude and wavelength $A=3.7\\,\\pm\\,0.1$\nkms$^{-1}$ and $\\lambda_{\\rm vel, i}=22.5\\,\\pm\\,0.1$ pc, respectively. The\nextremes in velocity correlate with a series of massive\n($\\sim10^{4}$M$_{\\odot}$) and compact ($R_{\\rm eq}\\sim2$ pc), quasi-regularly\nspaced ($\\sim8$ pc), molecular clouds. The corrugation wavelength and cloud\nseparation closely agree with the predicted Toomre ($\\sim17$ pc) and Jeans\n($\\sim6$ pc) lengths, respectively. We conclude that gravitational\ninstabilities are driving the condensation of molecular clouds within the\nGalactic Centre gas stream. Furthermore, we speculate these seeds are the\nhistorical analogue of the dust-ridge molecular clouds, representing the\ninitial conditions of star and cluster formation in the CMZ.\n", "  We demonstrate how to describe in an unified way early and late-time\nacceleration in the context of mimetic $F(R)$ gravity. As we show, an\nexponential $F(R)$ gravity model has appealing features, with regard to\nunification, and we perform an analysis of the late-time evolution. The\nresulting picture is interesting since in the mimetic case, certain pathologies\nof some ordinary $F(R)$ models are remedied in a consistent way, owing to the\npresence of the mimetic potential and the Lagrange multiplier. We quantify the\nlate-time evolution analysis by studying the scaled dark energy density, the\ndark energy equation of state and the total effective equation of state, and as\nwe show the late-time evolution is crucially affected by the functional form of\nthe $F(R)$ gravity. It is intriguing that the most appealing case corresponds\nto the exponential $F(R)$ gravity which unifies late and early-time\nacceleration. Finally, we study the behavior of the effective gravitational\nconstant and the growth factor, and as we show, significant differences between\nthe mimetic and ordinary $F(R)$ exponential model are spotted in the growth\nfactor.\n", "  The electron-doped high-transition-temperature (T_c) iron-based pnictide\nsuperconductor LaFeAsO_{1-x}H_x has a unique phase diagram: superconducting\n(SC) double domes are sandwiched by antiferromagnetic phases at ambient\npressure and they turn to a single dome with a maximum T_c that exceeds 45K at\na pressure of 3.0 GPa. We studied whether spin fluctuations are involved in\nincreasing T_c under a pressure of 3.0 GPa by using ^{75}As nuclear magnetic\nresonance (NMR) technique. The ^{75}As-NMR results for the powder samples show\nthat T_c increases up to 48 K without the influence of spin fluctuations. The\nfact indicates that spin fluctuations are not involved in raising T_c, which\nimplies that other factors, such as orbital degrees of freedom, may be\nimportant for achieving a high T_c of almost 50 K.\n", "  Notes in a musical piece are building blocks employed in non-random ways to\ncreate melodies. It is the \"interaction\" among a limited amount of notes that\nallows constructing the variety of musical compositions that have been written\nin centuries and within different cultures. Networks are a modeling tool that\nis commonly employed to represent a set of entities interacting in some way.\nThus, notes composing a melody can be seen as nodes of a network that are\nconnected whenever these are played in sequence. The outcome of such a process\nresults in a directed graph. By using complex network theory, some main metrics\nof musical graphs can be measured, which characterize the related musical\npieces. In this paper, we define a framework to represent melodies as networks.\nThen, we provide an analysis on a set of guitar solos performed by main\nmusicians. Results of this study indicate that the presented model can have an\nimpact on audio and multimedia applications such as music classification,\nidentification, e-learning, automatic music generation, multimedia\nentertainment.\n", "  The study is devoted to definition of generalized metrical and topological\n(informational entropy) characteristics of neural signals via their well-known\ntheoretical models. We have shown that time dependence of action potential of\nneurons is scale invariant. Information and entropy of neural signals have\nconstant values in case of self-similarity and self-affinity.\n", "  In this paper we will investigate the effects of a noncommutative (NC)\nspace-time on the dynamics of the universe. We will generalize the black hole\nentropy formula for a NC black hole. Then, using the entropic gravity\nformalism, we will show that the noncommutativity changes the strength of the\ngravitational field. By applying this result to a homogeneous and isotropic\nuniverse containing nonrelativistic matter and a cosmological constant, we will\nshow that the model modified by the noncommutativity of the space-time is a\nbetter fit to the obtained data than the standard one.\n", "  Certain predictions of quantum theory are not compatible with the notion of\nlocal-realism. This was the content of Bell's famous theorem of the year 1964.\nBell proved this with the help of an inequality, famously known as Bell's\ninequality. The alternative proofs of Bell's theorem without using Bell's\ninequality are known as `nonlocality without inequality (NLWI)' proofs. We,\nreview one such proof, namely the Hardy's proof which due to its simplicity and\ngenerality has been considered the best version of Bell's theorem.\n", "  We compare the rest-frame ultraviolet and rest-frame optical morphologies of\n2 < z < 3 star-forming galaxies in the GOODS-S field using Hubble Space\nTelescope WFC3 and ACS images from the CANDELS, GOODS, and ERS programs. We\nshow that the distribution of sizes and concentrations for 1.90 < z < 2.35\ngalaxies selected via their rest-frame optical emission-lines are statistically\nindistinguishable from those of Lyman-alpha emitting systems found at z ~ 2.1\nand z ~ 3.1. We also show that the z > 2 star-forming systems of all sizes and\nmasses become smaller and more compact as one shifts the observing window from\nthe UV to the optical. We argue that this offset is due to inside-out galaxy\nformation over the first ~ 2 Gyr of cosmic time.\n", "  We present spatially resolved ALMA [CII] observations of the bright (flux\ndensity S=400 mJy at 350 microns), gravitationally lensed, starburst galaxy\nPLCK G045.1+61.1 at z=3.427, the \"Garnet\". This source is part of our set of\n\"Planck's Dusty GEMS\", discovered with the Planck's all-sky survey. Two\nemission-line clouds with a relative velocity offset of ~600 km/s extend\ntowards north-east and south-west, respectively, of a small, intensely\nstar-forming clump with a star-formation intensity of 220 Msun/yr/kpc^2, akin\nto maximal starbursts. [CII] is also seen in absorption, with a redshift of\n+350 km/s relative to the brightest CO component. [CII] absorption has\npreviously only been found in the Milky Way along sightlines toward bright\nhigh-mass star-forming regions, and this is the first detection in another\ngalaxy. Similar to Galactic environments, the [CII] absorption feature is\nassociated with [CI] emission, implying that this is diffuse gas shielded from\nthe UV radiation of the clump, and likely at large distances from the clump.\nSince absorption can only be seen in front of a continuum source, the gas in\nthis structure can definitely be attributed to gas flowing towards the clump.\nThe absorber could be part of a cosmic filament or merger debris being accreted\nonto the galaxy. We discuss our results also in light of the on-going debate of\nthe origin of the [CII] deficit in dusty star-forming galaxies.\n", "  We investigate the link between the irreversibility generated by a stationary\ndissipative process and the correlations established within a composite quantum\nsystem. We provide two equivalent expressions for the entropy generated in the\nnon-equilibrium steady state of coupled quantum harmonic oscillators that allow\nfor a simple interpretation of the onset of irreversibility. We then unveil a\nquantitative relation between the entropy production rate and correlations,\nboth total and quantum, built between the two oscillators. In the\nsmall-coupling limit, the entropy production rate is shown to be proportional\nto both the mutual information and the quantum correlations. We apply our\nresults to the analysis of the optomechanical interaction between a\nnano-mechanical resonator and a cavity field, and show that the behavior of the\nentropy production captures the peculiar features of the model, such as\nsideband cooling and amplification.\n", "  The study of stellar kinematic properties may provide hints on the formation\nand evolution of elliptical and lenticular galaxies. Although most previous\nstudies have focused on the large scale of these galaxies, their central\nregions (scales of $\\sim$ 100 pc) may contain important clues about their\nstructure, such as kinematically decoupled cores. This is the fourth paper on a\nsample of 10 massive ($\\sigma$ $>$ 200 km s$^{-1}$) and nearby ($d$ $<$ 31 Mpc)\nearly-type galaxies, observed with the integral field unit of the Gemini South\nMulti Object Spectrograph. Here, we analyse the properties of the stellar\nkinematics in the circumnuclear region. We fitted the line-of-sight velocity\ndistribution with a Gauss-Hermite function. In seven galaxies of the sample, we\ndetected a rotation pattern in their radial velocity maps that are\nanti-correlated with $h_3$. We interpret this as stellar structures in rotation\nembedded in the bulges of the objects. Comparing the stellar kinematic results\nwith the PCA Tomography results and also with the gas kinematic results of IC\n5181, it seems that this object may have a non-axisymmetric potential at its\ncentre. The velocity dispersion maps of four objects have a nuclear peak, which\nmust correspond, in part, to unresolved stellar rotation. In NGC 1404, we\ndetected a kinematic decoupled core with an extension of $\\sim$ 200 pc. This\ngalaxy also has a $\\sigma$-drop in the centre, which may be related to both\nstellar components in counterrotation or with a kinematically cold star-forming\nregion.\n", "  We have calculated the resonant and nonresonant contributions to attosecond\nimpulsive stimulated electronic Raman scattering (SERS) in regions of\nautoionizing transitions. Comparison with Multiconfiguration Time-Dependent\nHartree-Fock (MCTDHF) calculations find that attosecond SERS is dominated by\ncontinuum transitions and not autoionizing resonances. These results agree\nquantitatively with a rate equation that includes second-order Raman and\nfirst-and second-order photoionization rates. Such rate models can be extended\nto larger molecular systems. Our results indicate that attosecond SERS\ntransition probabilities may be understood in terms of two-photon generalized\ncross sections even in the high-intensity limit for extreme ultraviolet\nwavelengths.\n", "  We perform the improved constraints on the Hubble constant $H_0$ by using the\nmodel-independent method, Gaussian Processes. Utilizing the latest 36 $H(z)$\nmeasurements, we obtain $H_0=69.21\\pm3.72$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$, which is\nconsistent with the Planck 2015 and Riess et al. 2016 analysis at $1\\sigma$\nconfidence level, and reduces the uncertainty from $6.5\\%$ (Busti et al. 2014)\nto $5.4\\%$. Different from the results of Busti et al. 2014 by only using 19\n$H(z)$ measurements, our reconstruction results of $H(z)$ and the derived\nvalues of $H_0$ are independent of the choice of covariance functions.\n", "  The present study addresses the reaction zone structure and burning mechanism\nof unstable detonations. Experiments investigated mainly two-dimensional\nmethane-oxygen cellular detonations in a thin channel geometry. The\nsufficiently high temporal resolution permitted to determine the PDF of the\nshock distribution, a power-law with an exponent of -3, and the burning rate of\nunreacted pockets from their edges - through surface turbulent flames with a\nspeed approximately 3-7 times larger than the laminar one at the local\nconditions. Numerical simulations were performed using a novel Large Eddy\nSimulation method where the reactions due to both auto-ignition and turbulent\ntransport and treated exactly at the sub-grid scale in a reaction-diffusion\nformulation. The model is an extension of Kerstein & Menon's Linear Eddy Model\nfor Large Eddy Simulation to treat flows with shock waves and rapid gasdynamic\ntransients. The two-dimensional simulations recovered well the amplification of\nthe laminar flame speed owing to the turbulence generated mainly by the shear\nlayers originating from the triple points and subsequent Richtmyer-Meshkov\ninstability associated with the internal pressure waves. The simulations\nclarified how the level of turbulence generated controlled the burning rate of\nthe pockets, the hydrodynamic thickness of the wave, the cellular structure and\nits distribution. Three-dimensional simulations were found in general good\nagreement with the two-dimensional ones, in that the sub-grid scale model\ncaptured the ensuing turbulent burning once the scales associated with the\ncellular dynamics, where turbulent kinetic energy is injected, are well\nresolved.\n", "  It is demonstrated that many important features of single-pion production in\n$pp$ collisions at intermediate energies ($T_p \\simeq 400$-$800$ MeV) can\nnaturally be explained by supposing excitation of intermediate diproton\nresonances in $pp$ channels ${}^1D_2$, ${}^3F_3$ and ${}^3P_2$, in addition to\nconventional mechanisms involving an intermediate $\\Delta$-isobar. We predict\nfor the first time the crucial role of the ${}^3P_2$ diproton resonance, found\nin recent experiments on the single-pion production reaction $pp \\to\npp({}^1S_0) \\pi^0$, in reproducing the proper behavior of spin-correlation\nparameters in the reaction $pp \\to d \\pi^+$ which were poorly described by\nconventional meson-exchange models to date. The possible quark structure of the\n$P$-wave diproton resonances is also discussed.\n", "  We have identified low-energy magnetic excitations in a doped quantum\ncritical system by means of polarized neutron scattering experiments. The\npresence of these excitations could explain why\nCe(Fe$_{0.76}$Ru$_{0.24}$)$_2$Ge$_2$ displays dynamical scaling in the absence\nof local critical behavior or long-range spin-density wave criticality. The\nlow-energy excitations are associated with the reorientations of the superspins\nof fully ordered, isolated magnetic clusters that form spontaneously upon\nlowering the temperature. The system houses both frozen clusters and dynamic\nclusters, as predicted by Hoyos and Vojta [Phys. Rev. B 74, 140401 (R) (2006)].\n", "  We use a simple form of the K-essence theory and apply it to the classic\nisotropic cosmological model and seek exact solutions. The particular form of\nthe kinetic term that we choose is $K \\left(\\phi, X \\right)= K_0(\\phi)X^m\n+K_1$. The resulting field equations in the homogeneous and isotropic cosmology\n(FRW)is considered. Several exact solutions are obtained.\n", "  It is shown how Fermionic material particles can emerge from a covariant\nformulation of the de Broglie-Bohm theory. Material particles are continuous\nfields, formed as the eigenvalue of the Schrodinger field operator, evaluated\nalong a Bohmian trajectory. The motivation for this work is due to a theorem\nproved by Malament that states there cannot be a relativistic quantum mechanics\nof localizable particles.\n", "  Following the various statements of [DW16] to their logical conclusion, this\nnote explicitly argues the following statement, implicit in [DW16]: for\npositive semi-definite operators $C_{1},\\ldots,\\,C_{L} $, a unitary $V_{C_{i}}$\ncommuting with $C_{i}$, and $p\\geq1$, the quantity $$\n\\max_{V_{C_{1}},\\ldots,V_{C_{L}}}\\left\\Vert C_{1}^{1/p}V_{C_{1}}\\cdots\nC_{L}^{1/p}V_{C_{L}}\\right\\Vert _{p}^{p} $$ is monotone non-increasing with\nrespect to $p$. The idea from [DW16] is that by allowing unitary swivels\nconnecting a long chain of positive semi-definite operators together, we can\nestablish such a statement, which might not hold generally without the presence\nof the unitary swivels. Other related statements follow directly from [DW16] as\nwell, being implicit there, and are given explicitly in this note.\n", "  Modern Cosmology offers us a great understanding of the universe with\nstriking precision, made possible by the modern technologies of the newest\ngenerations of telescopes. The standard cosmological model, however, is not\nabsent of theoretical problems and open questions. One possibility that has\nbeen put forward is the existence of a coupling between dark sectors. The idea\nof an interaction between the dark components could help physicists understand\nwhy we live in an epoch of the universe where dark matter and dark energy are\ncomparable in terms of energy density, which can be regarded as a coincidence\ngiven that their time evolutions are completely different.\n  We introduce the interaction phenomenologically and proceed to test models of\ninteraction with observations of redshift-space distortions. In a flat universe\ncomposed only of those two fluids, we consider separately two forms of\ninteraction, through terms proportional to the densities of both dark energy\nand dark matter. An analytic expression for the growth rate approximated as $f\n= \\Omega_{\\mathrm{DM}}^{\\gamma}$, where $\\Omega_{\\mathrm{DM}}$ is the\npercentage contribution from the dark matter to the content of the universe and\n$\\gamma$ is the growth index, is derived in terms of the interaction strength\nand of other parameters of the model in the first case, while for the second\nmodel we show that a non-zero interaction cannot be accommodated by the index\ngrowth approximation. The successful expressions obtained are then used to\ncompare the predictions with growth of structure observational data in a MCMC\ncode.\n  We also employ observations of galaxy clusters to assess their virial state\nvia the modified Layzer-Irvine equation in order to detect signs of an\ninteraction, obtaining measurements of observed virial ratios, interaction\nstrength, rest virial ratio and departure from equilibrium for a set of\nclusters. [abridged]\n", "  Magetoresistive Random Access Memory (MRAM) was irradiated by 60Co\n{\\gamma}-rays and electron beam. The test of synergistic effect was performed\nunder additional magnetic field when irradiation. We analyzed Total Ionizing\nDose (TID) and synergistic damage mechanism of MRAM. DC, AC and function\nparameters of the memory were tested in radiation and annealing by Very Large\nScale Integrated circuit (VLSI) test system. The radiation sensitive parameters\nwere obtained through analyzing the data. Because magnetic field imposed on\nMRAM when the test of synergistic effect, Shallow Trench Isolation (STI)\nleakage or Frenkel-Poole emission of synergistic effect was smaller than that\nof TID, and radiation damage of synergistic effect was lower than that of TID.\n", "  Spatially resolved maps of Jupiter's far-infrared 17-37 $\\mu$m\nhydrogen-helium collision-induced spectrum were acquired by the FORCAST\ninstrument on the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA) in\nMay 2014. Spectral scans in two grisms covered the broad S(0) and S(1)\nabsorption lines, in addition to contextual imaging in eight broad-band filters\n(5-37 $\\mu$m) with spatial resolutions of 2-4\". The spectra were inverted to\nmap the zonal-mean temperature and para-H$_2$ distribution ($f_p$, the fraction\nof the para spin isomer with respect to the ortho spin isomer) in Jupiter's\nupper troposphere (the 100-700 mbar range). We compared these to a reanalysis\nof Voyager-1 and -2 IRIS spectra covering the same spectral range. Para-H$_2$\nincreases from equator to pole, with low-$f_p$ air at the equator representing\nsub-equilibrium conditions (i.e., less para-H$_2$ than expected from thermal\nequilibration), and high-$f_p$ air and possible super-equilibrium at higher\nlatitudes. In particular, we confirm the continued presence of a region of\nhigh-$f_p$ air at high northern latitudes discovered by Voyager/IRIS, and an\nasymmetry with generally higher $f_p$ in the north than in the south. We note\nthat existing collision-induced absorption databases lack opacity from\n(H$_2$)$_2$ dimers, leading to under-prediction of the absorption near the S(0)\nand S(1) peaks. There appears to be no spatial correlation between para-H$_2$\nand tropospheric ammonia, phosphine and cloud opacity derived from Voyager/IRIS\nat mid-infrared wavelengths (7-15 $\\mu$m). We note, however, that para-H$_2$\ntracks the similar latitudinal distribution of aerosols within Jupiter's upper\ntropospheric and stratospheric hazes observed in reflected sunlight, suggesting\nthat catalysis of hydrogen equilibration within the hazes (and not the main\nclouds) may govern the equator-to-pole gradient. [Abridged]\n", "  We present our current work on the spectral analysis of the hot sdO star\nFeige 34. We combine high S/N optical spectra and fully-blanketed non-LTE model\natmospheres to derive its fundamental parameters (Teff, log g) and helium\nabundance. Our best fits indicate Teff =63 000 K, log g=6.0 and log\nN(He)/N(H)=-1.8. We also use available ultraviolet spectra (IUE and FUSE) to\nmeasure metal abundances. We find the star to be enriched in iron and nickel by\na factor of ten with respect to the solar values, while lighter elements have\nsubsolar abundances. The FUSE spectrum suggests that the spectral lines could\nbe broadened by rotation.\n", "  Ubiquitous graphene is a stricly 2D material representing an ideal adsorbing\nplatform due to its large specific surface area as well as its mechanical\nstrength and resistance to both thermal and chemical stresses. However,\ngraphene as a bulk material has the tendency to form irreversible agglomerates\nleading to 3D graphitic structures with a significant decrease of the area\navailable for adsorption and no room for gas intercalation. In this paper a\nnovel nanoporous graphite formed by graphtriyne sheets is introduced: its 3D\nstructure is theoretically assessed by means of electronic structure and\nmolecular dynamics computations within the DFT level of theory. It is found\nthat the novel layered carbon allotrope is almost as compact as pristine\ngraphite but the inherent porosity of the 2D graphyne sheets and its relative\nstacking leads to nanochannels that cross the material and whose sub-nanometer\nsize could allow the diffusion and storage of gas species. A molecular\nprototype of the nanochannel is used to accurately determine first principles\nadsorption energies and enthalpies for CO2, N2, H2O and H2 within the pores.\nThe proposed porous graphite presents no significant barrier for gas diffusion\nand it shows a high propensity for CO2 physisorption with respect to the other\nrelevant components in both pre- and post-combustion gas streams.\n", "  We discuss a recent study on high-energy jet production in the multi-Regge\nlimit done with the use of the Monte Carlo event generator BFKLex which\nincludes collinear improvements in the form of double-log contributions. We\nwill show results for the average transverse momentum and azimuthal angle of\nthe final state jets when at least one of them is very forward in rapidity and\nanother one is very backward. We also discuss the introduction of a new\nobservable which accounts for the average rapidity ratio among subsequent\nemissions.\n", "  The muonic vacuum polarization contribution to the $g$-factor of the electron\nbound in a nuclear potential is investigated theoretically. The electric as\nwell as the magnetic loop contributions are evaluated. We found these muonic\neffects to be observable in planned trapped-ion experiments with light and\nmedium-heavy highly charged ions. The enhancement due to the strong Coulomb\nfield boosts these contributions much above the corresponding terms in the\nfree-electron $g$-factor. Due to their magnitude, muonic vacuum polarization\nterms are also significant in planned determinations of the fine-structure\nconstant from the bound-electron $g$-factor.\n", "  We discuss briefly a recent study of new observables in LHC inclusive events\nwith three tagged jets. One jet is in the forward direction, the second is in\nthe backward direction and well-separated in rapidity from the first, whereas,\nthe third tagged jet is to be found in more central regions of the detector.\nTaking into consideration that non-tagged mini-jet emissions are allowed and\nthat they may be accounted for by the BFKL gluon Green function, we project the\ncross sections on azimuthal-angle components and define suitable ratios based\non these projections which can provide several distinct tests of the BFKL\ndynamics.\n", "  Inter-layer synchronization is a dynamical state occurring in multi-layer\nnetworks composed of identical nodes. The state corresponds to have all layers\nsynchronized, with nodes in each layer which do not necessarily evolve in\nunison. So far, the study of such a solution has been restricted to the case in\nwhich all layers had an identical connectivity structure. When layers are not\nidentical, the inter-layer synchronous state is no longer a stable solution of\nthe system. Nevertheless, when layers differ in just a few links, an\napproximate treatment is still feasible, and allows one to gather information\non whether and how the system may wander around an inter-layer synchronous\nconfiguration. We report the details of an approximate analytical treatment for\na two-layer multiplex, which results in the introduction of an extra inertial\nterm accounting for structural differences. Numerical validation of the\npredictions highlights the usefulness of our approach, especially for small or\nmoderate topological differences in the intra-layer coupling. Moreover, we\nidentify a non-trivial relationship between the betweenness centrality of the\nmissing links and the intra-layer coupling strength. Finally, by the use of two\nmultiplexed identical layers of electronic circuits in a chaotic regime, we\nstudy the loss of inter-layer synchronization as a function of the betweenness\ncentrality of the removed links.\n", "  Industrial radiography has its inimitable role in non-destructive\nexaminations. Industrial radiography devices, consisting of significantly high\nactivity of the radioisotopes, are operated manually by remotely held control\nunit. Malfunctioning of these devices may cause potential exposure to the\noperator and nearby public, and thus should be practiced under a systematic\nrisk control. To ensure the radiation safety, proactive risk assessment should\nbe implemented. Risk assessment in industrial radiography using the Failure\nModes & Effect Analysis (FMEA) for the design and operation of industrial\nradiography exposure devices has been carried out in this study. Total 56\ncomponent failure modes were identified and Risk Priority Numbers (RPNs) were\nassigned by the FMEA expert team, based on the field experience and reported\nfailure data of various components. Results shows all the identified failure\nmodes have RPN in the range of 04 to 216 and most of the higher RPN are due to\nlow detectability and high severity levels. Assessment reveals that increasing\nfailure detectability is a practical and feasible approach to reduce the risk\nin most of the failure modes of industrial radiography devices. Actions for\nreducing RPN for each failure mode have been suggested. Feasibility of FMEA for\nrisk assessment in industrial radiography has been established by this study\n", "  A fully kinetic simulation approach, treating each plasma component based on\nthe Vlasov equation, is adopted to study the disintegration of an initial\ndensity perturbation (IDP) into a number of ion-acoustic solitary waves (IASWs)\nin the presence of the trapping effect of electrons. The non-linear fluid\ntheory developed by Schamel has identified three separate regimes of\nion-acoustic solitary waves based on the trapping parameter. Here, the\ndisintegration process and the resulting self-consistent IASWs are studied in a\nwide range of trapping parameters covering all the three regimes continuously.\nThe dependency of features such as the time of disintegration, the number,\nspeed and size of IASWs on the trapping parameter are focused upon. It is shown\nthat an increase in this parameter slows down the propagation of IASWs while\ndecreases their sizes in the phase space. These features of IASWs tend to\nsaturate for large value of trapping parameters. The disintegration time shows\na more complicated behavior than what was predicted by the theoretical\napproach. Also for the case of trapping parameters bigger than one, propagation\nof IASWs is observed in contrast with the theoretical predictions. The kinetic\nsimulation results unveil a smooth and well-defined dependency of solitary\nwaves' features on the trapping parameter, showing the possibility of bridging\nall the three regimes. Finally, it is shown that for beta around zero, the\nelectron phase space structure of the accompanying vortex stays symmetric. The\neffect of the electron-to-ion temperature ratio on the disintegration and the\npropagation of IASWs are considered as a benchmarking test of the simulation\ncode (in the nonlinear regime).\n", "  We study the effect of localized Joule heating on the mechanical properties\nof doubly clamped nanowires under tensile stress. Local heating results in\nsystematic variation of the resonant frequency; these frequency changes result\nfrom thermal stresses that depend on temperature dependent thermal conductivity\nand expansion coefficient. The change in sign of the linear expansion\ncoefficient of InAs is reflected in the resonant response of the system near a\nbath temperature of 20 K. Using finite element simulations to model the\nexperimentally observed frequency shifts, we show that the thermal conductivity\nof a nanowire can be approximated in the 10-60 K temperature range by the\nempirical form $\\kappa=b$T W/mK, where the value of $b$ for a nanowire was\nfound to be $b=0.035$ W/mK$^2$, significantly lower than bulk values. Also,\nlocal heating allows us to independently vary the temperature of the nanowire\nrelative to the clamping points pinned to the bath temperature. We suggest a\nloss mechanism (dissipation $\\sim10^{-4}-10^{-5}$) originating from the\ninterfacial clamping losses between the metal and the semiconductor\nnanostructure.\n", "  In this paper, the performance of two lattice Boltzmann method formulations\nfor yield-stress (i.e. viscoplastic) fluids has been investigated. The first\napproach is based on the popular Papanastasiou regularisation of the fluid\nrheology in conjunction with explicit modification of the lattice Boltzmann\nrelaxation rate. The second approach uses a locally-implicit formulation to\nsimultaneously solve for the fluid stress and the underlying particle\ndistribution functions. After investigating issues related to the lattice\nsymmetry and non-hydrodynamic Burnett stresses, the two models were compared in\nterms of spatial convergence and their behaviour in transient and inertial\nflows. The choice of lattice and the presence of Burnett stresses was found to\ninfluence the results of both models, however the latter did not significantly\ndegrade the velocity field. Using Bingham flows in ducts and synthetic porous\nmedia, it was found that the implicitly-regularised model was superior in\ncapturing transient and inertial fluid behaviour. This result presents\npotential implications for the application of the Papanastasiou-regularised\nmodel in such scenarios. In creeping flows the performance of both models was\nfound to be both similar and satisfactory.\n", "  Purpose: The main purpose of this study was to assess the reliability of\nshape and heterogeneity features in both Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and\nlow-dose Computed Tomography (CT) components of PET/CT. A secondary objective\nwas to investigate the impact of image quantization.Material and methods: A\nHealth Insurance Portability and Accountability Act -compliant secondary\nanalysis of deidentified prospectively acquired PET/CT test-retest datasets of\n74 patients from multi-center Merck and ACRIN trials was performed.\nMetabolically active volumes were automatically delineated on PET with Fuzzy\nLocally Adaptive Bayesian algorithm. 3DSlicerTM was used to semi-automatically\ndelineate the anatomical volumes on low-dose CT components. Two quantization\nmethods were considered: a quantization into a set number of bins\n(quantizationB) and an alternative quantization with bins of fixed width\n(quantizationW). Four shape descriptors, ten first-order metrics and 26\ntextural features were computed. Bland-Altman analysis was used to quantify\nrepeatability. Features were subsequently categorized as very reliable,\nreliable, moderately reliable and poorly reliable with respect to the\ncorresponding volume variability. Results: Repeatability was highly variable\namongst features. Numerous metrics were identified as poorly or moderately\nreliable. Others were (very) reliable in both modalities, and in all categories\n(shape, 1st-, 2nd- and 3rd-order metrics). Image quantization played a major\nrole in the features repeatability. Features were more reliable in PET with\nquantizationB, whereas quantizationW showed better results in CT.Conclusion:\nThe test-retest repeatability of shape and heterogeneity features in PET and\nlow-dose CT varied greatly amongst metrics. The level of repeatability also\ndepended strongly on the quantization step, with different optimal choices for\neach modality. The repeatability of PET and low-dose CT features should be\ncarefully taken into account when selecting metrics to build multiparametric\nmodels.\n", "  NbP is a recently realized Weyl semimetal (WSM), hosting Weyl points through\nwhich conduction and valence bands cross linearly in the bulk and exotic Fermi\narcs appear. However, the most intriguing transport phenomenon of a WSM, the\nchiral anomaly-induced negative magnetoresistance (NMR) in parallel electric\nand magnetic fields, has yet to be observed in NbP. In intrinsic NbP the Weyl\npoints lie far from the Fermi energy, making chiral magneto-transport elusive.\nHere, we use Ga-doping to relocate the Fermi energy in NbP sufficiently close\nto the Weyl points, for which the different Fermi surfaces are verified by\nresultant quantum oscillations. Consequently, we observe a NMR for parallel\nelectric and magnetic fields, which is considered as a signature of the chiral\nanomaly in condensed-matter physics. The NMR survives up to room temperature,\nmaking NbP a versatile material platform for the development of Weyltronic\napplications.\n", "  In a social dilemma game group members are allowed to decide if they\ncontribute to the joint venture or not. As a consequence, defectors, who do not\ninvest but only enjoy the mutual benefit, prevail and the system evolves onto\nthe tragedy of the common state. This unfortunate scenario can be avoided if\nparticipation is not obligatory but only happens with a given probability. But\nwhat if we also consider a player's individual wealth when to decide about\nparticipation? To address this issue we propose a model in which the\nprobabilistic participation in the public goods game is combined with a\nconditional investment mode that is based on individual wealth: if a player's\nwealth exceeds a threshold value then it is qualified and can participate in\nthe joint venture. Otherwise, the participation is forbidden in the investment\ninteractions. We show that if only probabilistic participation is considered,\nspatially structured populations cannot support cooperation better than\nwell-mixed populations where full defection state can also be avoided for small\nparticipation probabilities. By adding the wealth-based criterion of\nparticipation, however, structured populations are capable to augment network\nreciprocity relevantly and allow cooperator strategy to dominate in a broader\nparameter interval.\n", "  Leaning upon the Fock method of the stereographic projection of the\nthree-dimensional momentum space onto the four-dimensional unit sphere the\npossibility of the analytical solving of the Lippmann-Schwinger integral\nequation for the partial wave two-body Coulomb transition matrix at the ground\nbound state energy has been studied. In this case new expressions for the\npartial p-, d- and f-wave two-body Coulomb transition matrices have been\nobtained in the simple analytical form. The developed approach can also be\nextended to determine analytically the partial wave Coulomb transition matrices\nat the energies of excited bound states.

Powder neutron diffraction data collected from samples obtained\nby a new hydrothermal synthetic route reveal a previously unobserved trigonal\nP3121 structure, similar to the isoelectronic mineral SrCu3V2O8(OH)2. The\nrefined structure is consistent with orbital frustration of the eg d-orbitals\nin a sublattice of the Cu2+ kagome network due to a dynamic Jahn-Teller effect,\nwhich persists below the magnetic transition at TN = 9K and makes the material\nan interesting candidate for exploring concomitant spin and orbital\nfrustration. A combination of crystallographic strain analysis and\nmagnetisation measurements indicate strong magnetostructural coupling which may\nexplain the varied magnetic behaviour between samples of vesignieite in the\nliterature. The revised orbital structure is similar to that found in\nvolborthite, rather than the quantum spin liquid herbertsmithite, and provides\na convincing argument for the differing magnetic properties found in these\nfrustrated magnets.\n", "  We present the first results of a new data analysis pipeline for processing\nextragalactic AKARI/IRC images. The main improvements of the pipeline over the\nstandard analysis are the removal of Earth shine and image distortion\ncorrection. We present the differential number counts of the AKARI/IRC S11\nfilter IRAC validation field. The differential number counts are consistent\nwith S11 AKARI NEP deep and 12 microns WISE NEP number counts, and with a\nphenomenological backward evolution galaxy model, at brighter fluxes densities.\nThere is a detection of deeper galaxies in the IRAC validation field.\n", "  We study numerically the propagation of seismic waves in a three-dimensional\nblock medium. The medium is modeled by a spatial lattice of masses connected by\nelastic springs and viscous dampers. We study Lamb's problem under a surface\npoint vertical load. The cases of both step and pulse load are considered. The\ndisplacements and velocities are calculated for surface masses. The influence\nof the viscosity of the dampers on the attenuation of perturbations is studied.\nWe compare our numerical results for the block medium with known analytical\nsolutions for the elastic medium.\n", "  Volterra functions were introduced at the beginning of the twentieth century\nas solutions of some integral equations of convolution type with logarithmic\nkernel. Since then, few authors have studied this family of functions and faced\nwith the problem of providing a clear understanding of their asymptotic\nbehaviour for small and large arguments. This paper reviews some of the most\nimportant results on Volterra functions and in particular collects, into a\nquite general framework, several results on their asymptotic expansions, these\nresults turn out to be useful not only for the full understanding of the\nbehaviour of the Volterra functions but also for their numerical computation.\nThe connections with integrals of Ramanujan type, which have several important\napplications, are also discussed.\n", "  In this research, methods and computational results based on statistical\nanalysis and mathematical modelling, data collection in situ in order to make a\nhazard map of Hanta Virus infection in the region of Araucania, Chile are\npresented. The development of this work involves several elements such as\nLandsat satellite images, biological information regarding seropositivity of\nHanta Virus and information concerning positive cases of infection detected in\nthe region.

We hope the recorded discussions will be helpful, especially to\nthe current and future young researchers and students.\n", "  The advent of photonic bandgap (PBG) guiding hollow- core photonic crystal\nfiber (HC-PCF) sparked the hope of guiding light with attenuation below the\nfundamental silica Rayleigh scattering limit (SRSL) of conventional step-index\nfibers. Unfortunately, the combination of the strong core-cladding\noptical-overlap, the surface roughness at the silica cladding struts and the\npresence of interface-modes limited the lowest reported transmission-loss to\n1.2 dB/km at 1550 nm. This hope is recently revived by the introduction of\nhypocycloid core- contour (i.e. negative curvature) in inhibited-coupling (IC)\nguiding HC-PCF, and the reduction of their confinement loss to a level that\nmakes them serious contenders for light transmission below the SRSL in UV-\nVIS-NIR spectral range. Here, we report on several IC guiding HC-PCFs with a\nhypocycloid core-contour and a cladding structure made of a single ring from a\ntubular lattice. The fibers guide in the UV-VIS and NIR, and among which we\nlist one with a record transmission loss of 7.7 dB/km at ~750 nm (only a factor\n~2 above the SRSL), and a second with an ultra-broad fundamental-band with loss\nin the range of 10-20 dB/km spanning from 600 to 1200 nm. Both fibers present\nnear-single mode guidance and very low bend loss sensitivity. The results show\nthat the limit in the transmission is set by confinement loss for wavelengths\nlonger than ~1 {\\mu}m and by surface- roughness for shorter wavelengths, thus\nindicating that transmission loss well below the SRSL in the visible is\npossible with a surface roughness reduction and would open the possibility of\nthe first UV low-loss light- guidance.\n", "  The relationship for the energy variation, work done, and energy dissipation\nin unit volumetric fluid of incompressible flow is derived. A universal\nequation for calculating the energy gradient function is presented for\nsituations where both pressure driven flow and shear driven flow are present\nsimultaneously.\n", "  Using our newly developed model atmosphere code appropriate for magnetic\nwhite dwarfs with metal lines in the Paschen-Back regime, we study various\nmagnetic white dwarfs and explore the effects of various parameters such as the\nfield geometry and the convective efficiency\n", "  Online social networks represent a main source of communication and\ninformation exchange in today's life. They facilitate exquisitely news sharing,\nknowledge elicitation, and forming groups of same interests. Researchers in the\nlast two decades studied the growth dynamics of the online social networks\nextensively questing a clear understanding of the behavior of humans in online\nsocial networks that helps in many directions, like engineering better\nrecommendation systems and attracting new members. However, not all of social\nnetworks achieved the desired growth, for example, online social networks like\nMySpace, Orkut, and Friendster are out of service today. In this work, we\npresent a probabilistic theoretical model that captures the dynamics of the\nsocial decay due to the inactivity of the members of a social network. The\nmodel is proved to have some interesting mathematical properties, namely\n\\textit{submodularity}, which imply achieving the model optimization in a\nreasonable performance. That means the maximization problem can be approximated\nwithin a factor of $(1-1/e)$ and the minimization problem can be achieved in\npolynomial time.\n", "  In recent years, universal scaling has gained renewed attention in the study\nof magnetocaloric materials. It has been applied to a wide variety of pure\nelements and compounds, ranging from rare earth-based materials to transition\nmetal alloys, from bulk crystalline samples to nanoparticles. It is therefore\nnecessary to quantify the limits within which the scaling laws would remain\napplicable for magnetocaloric research. For this purpose, a threefold approach\nhas been followed: a) the magnetocaloric responses of a set of materials with\nCurie temperatures ranging from 46 to 336 K have been modeled with a mean-field\nBrillouin model, b) experimental data for Gd has been analyzed, and c) a\n3D-Ising model ---which is beyond the mean-field approximation--- has been\nstudied. In this way we can demonstrate that the conclusions extracted in this\nwork are model-independent. It is found that universal scaling remains\napplicable up to applied fields which provide a magnetic energy to the system\nup to 8\\% of the thermal energy at the Curie temperature. In this range, the\npredicted deviations from scaling laws remain below the experimental error\nmargin of carefully performed experiments. Therefore, for materials whose Curie\ntemperature is close to room temperature, scaling laws at the Curie temperature\nwould be applicable for the magnetic field range available at conventional\nmagnetism laboratories ($\\sim 10$ T), well above the fields which are usually\navailable for magnetocaloric devices.\n", "  Plasmonic nanoparticles influence the absorption and emission processes of\nnearby emitters due to local enhancements of the illuminating radiation and the\nphotonic density of states. Here, we use the plasmon resonance of metal\nnanoparticles in order to enhance the stimulated depletion of excited molecules\nfor super-resolved microscopy. We demonstrate stimulated emission depletion\n(STED) microscopy with gold nanorods with a long axis of only 26 nm and a width\nof 8 nm that provide an enhancement of the resolution compared to\nfluorescent-only probes without plasmonic components irradiated with the same\ndepletion power. These novel nanoparticle-assisted STED probes represent a\n~2x10^3 reduction in probe volume compared to previously used nanoparticles and\nwe demonstrate their application to the first plasmon-assisted STED cellular\nimaging. We also discuss their current limitations.\n", "  This is author's Habilitation Thesis (Dr. Sci. dissertation) submitted at the\nbeginning of September 2004. It is written in Russian and is posted due to the\ncontinuing requests for the manuscript.\n  The content: 1. Introduction, 2. Nonlinear chains with the discrete time and\ntheir self-similar solutions, 3. General theory of theta hypergeometric series,\n4. Theta hypergeometric integrals, 5. Biorthogonal functions, 6. Elliptic\nhypergeometric functions with |q|=1, 7. Conclusion, 8. References.\n  It contains an outline of a general heuristic scheme for building univariate\nspecial functions through self-similar reductions of spectral transformation\nchains, which allowed construction of the differential-difference q-Painleve\nequations, as well as of the most general known set of elliptic biorthogonal\nfunctions comprising all classical orthogonal polynomials and biorthogonal\nrational functions. One of the key results of the thesis consists in the\ndiscovery of genuinely transcendental elliptic hypergeometric functions\ndetermined by the elliptic hypergeometric integrals. The whole theory of such\nintegrals can be built from the univariate elliptic beta integral -- the most\ncomplicated known definite integral with exact evaluation, which generalizes\nthe ordinary binomial theorem and its q-extension, Euler's beta integral, the\nmeasure for Askey-Wilson polynomials, and many other previously established\nresults on ordinary and q-hypergeometric functions.\n", "  Recent technical advances in dealing with finite-size errors make quantum\nMonte Carlo methods quite appealing for treating extended systems in electronic\nstructure calculations, especially when commonly-used density functional theory\n(DFT) methods might not be satisfactory. We present a theoretical study of\nmartensitic phase transition of a two-dimensional phosphorene by employing\ndiffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) approach to investigate the energetics of this\nphase transition. The DMC calculation supports DFT prediction of having a\nrather diffusive barrier that is characterized by having two transition states,\nin addition to confirming that the so-called black and blue phases of\nphosphorene are essentially degenerate. At the same time, the calculation shows\nthe importance of treating correlation energy accurately for describing the\nenergy changes in the martensitic phase transition, as is already widely\nappreciated for chemical bond formation/dissociation. Building on the atomistic\ncharacterization of the phase transition process, we also discuss how\nmechanical strain influences the stabilities of the two phases of phosphorene.\n", "  It is well-known that de Sitter Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{o}(1,4)$ contrary to\nanti-de Sitter one $\\mathfrak{o}(2,3)$ does not have a standard\n$\\mathbb{Z}_2$-graded superextension.

Using the standard contraction\nprocedure for this superextension we obtain an {\\it alternative}\nsuper-Poincar\\'e algebra with the $\\mathbb{Z}_2\\times\\mathbb{Z}_2$-grading.\n", "  The calcium isotopes have emerged as an important testing ground for new\nmicroscopically derived shell-model interactions, and a great deal of focus has\nbeen directed toward this region. We investigate the relative spectroscopic\nstrengths associated with $1f_{7/2}$ neutron hole states in $^{47, 49}$Ca\nfollowing one-neutron knockout reactions from $^{48,50}$Ca. The observed\nreduction of strength populating the lowest 7/2$^{-}_{1}$ state in $^{49}$Ca,\nas compared to $^{47}$Ca, is consistent with the description given by\nshell-model calculations based on two- and three-nucleon forces in the neutron\n$pf$ model space, implying a fragmentation of the $l$=3 strength to\nhigher-lying states. The experimental result is inconsistent with both the\nGXPF1 interaction routinely used in this region of the nuclear chart and with\nmicroscopic calculations in an extended model space including the $\\nu1g_{9/2}$\norbital.\n", "  We study numerically and experimentally supercontinuum generation in optical\nfibers with dark and bright solitons simultaneously contributing into the\nspectral broadening and dispersive wave generation. We report a novel type of\nweak trapped radiation arising due to interaction of bright solitons with the\ndark soliton background. This radiation expresses itself as two pulses with the\ncontinuously shifting spectra constituting the short and long wavelength limits\nof the continuum. Our theoretical and experimental results are in good\nagreement.\n", "  We propose here the use of the variational level set methodology to capture\nLagrangian vortex boundaries in 2D unsteady velocity fields. This method\nreformulates earlier approaches that seek material vortex boundaries as\nextremum solutions of variational problems. We demonstrate the performance of\nthis technique for two different variational formulations built upon different\nnotions of coherence. The first formulation uses an energy functional that\npenalizes the deviation of a closed material line from piecewise uniform\nstretching [Haller and Beron-Vera, J. Fluid Mech. 731, R4 (2013)]. The second\nenergy function is derived for a graph-based approach to vortex boundary\ndetection [Hadjighasem et al., Phys. Rev. E 93, 063107 (2016)]. Our level-set\nformulation captures an a priori unknown number of vortices simultaneously at\nrelatively low computational cost. We illustrate the approach by identifying\nvortices from different coherence principles in several examples.\n", "  We exactly calculate the fourth virial coefficient for hard spheres in even\ndimensions for D=4,6,8,10, and 12.\n", "  We study the virial coefficients B_k of hard spheres in D dimensions by means\nof Monte-Carlo integration.

For 7<=k<=17 we compute sets of Ree-Hoover\ndiagrams and find that either for large D or large k the dominant diagrams are\n\"loose packed\". We use these results to study the radius of convergence and the\nvalidity of the many approximations used for the equations of state for hard\nspheres.\n", "  We present new results for the virial coefficients B_k with k <= 10 for hard\nspheres in dimensions D=2,...,8.\n", "  We evaluate the virial coefficients B_k for k<=10 for hard spheres in\ndimensions D=2,...,8. Virial coefficients with k even are found to be negative\nwhen D>=5. This provides strong evidence that the leading singularity for the\nvirial series lies away from the positive real axis when D>=5. Further analysis\nprovides evidence that negative virial coefficients will be seen for some k>10\nfor D=4, and there is a distinct possibility that negative virial coefficients\nwill also eventually occur for D=3.\n"]}
