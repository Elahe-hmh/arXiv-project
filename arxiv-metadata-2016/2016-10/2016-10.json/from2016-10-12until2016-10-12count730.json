essence of genetic\nregulatory networks and the field of Artificial Embryology (or Computational\nDevelopment). A model is proposed, with the objective of providing an effective\nway to generate arbitrary forms by using evolutionary-developmental techniques.\nPreliminary experiments have been performed.\n", "  The stability of the Maxwellian of the Boltzmann equation with a large\namplitude external potential $\\Phi$ has been an important open problem. In this\npaper, we resolve this problem with a large $C3-$potential in a periodic box\n$\\mathbb{T}^d$, $d \\geq 3$. We use [1] in $L^p-L^{\\infty}$ framework to\nestablish the well-posedness and the $L^{\\infty}-$stability of the Maxwellian\n$\\mu_E(x,v)=\\exp\\{-\\frac{|v|^2}{2}-\\Phi(x)\\}$.\n", "  We have used deep V-band and JHKs-band observations to investigate\nvariability and stellar populations near the Galactic plane in Centaurus, and\ncompared the observations with the Galactic model of Besancon. By applying\nimage subtraction technique to a series of over 580 V-band frames taken with\nthe ESO VLT/VIMOS instrument during two contiguous nights in April 2005, we\nhave detected 333 variables among 84,734 stars in the brightness range\n12.7<V<26.0 mag. Infrared data collected in March 2010 with the new ESO VISTA\ntelescope allowed us to construct deep combined optical-IR colour-magnitude and\ncolour-colour diagrams. All detected variables but four transit candidates are\nreported for the first time. The majority of the variables are\neclipsing/ellipsoidal binaries and delta Scuti-type pulsators. The occurrence\nrate of eclipsing/ellipsoidal variables reached ~0.28% of all stars. This is\nvery close to the highest fraction of binary systems detected using\nground-based data so far (0.30%), but still about four times less than the\naverage occurrence rate recently obtained from the Kepler space mission after\n44 days of operation. Comparison of the observed Ks vs. V-Ks diagram with a\ndiagram based on the Besancon model shows significant effects of both distance\nand reddening in the investigated direction of the sky. We demonstrate that the\nbest model indicates the presence of absorbing clouds at distances 11-13 kpc\nfrom the Sun in the minor Carina-Sagittarius Arm.\n", "  In this talk, we report our recent study of constraining the non-Newtonian\ngravity at femtometer scale. We incorporate the Yukawa-type non-Newtonian\ngravitational potential consistently to the Skyrme functional form using the\nexact treatment for the direct contribution and density-matrix expansion method\nfor the exchange contribution. The effects from the non-Newtonian potential on\nfinite nuclei properties are then studied together with a well-tested Skyrme\nforce. Assuming that the framework without non-Newtonian gravity can explain\nthe binding energies and charge radii of medium to heavy nuclei within 2%\nerror, we set an upper limit for the strength of the non-Newtonian\ngravitational potential at femtometer scale.\n", "  We demonstrate the stability of a spin-triplet paired s-wave (with an\nadmixture of extended s-wave) state for the case of purely repulsive\ninteractions in a degenerate two-band Hubbard model. We further show that near\nhalf-filling the considered kind of superconductivity can coexist with\nantiferromagnetism. The calculations have been carried out with the use of the\nso-called statistically consistent Gutzwiller approximation for the case of a\nsquare lattice. The absence of a stable paired state when analyzed in the\nHartree-Fock-BCS approximation allows us to claim that the electron\ncorrelations in conjunction with the Hund's rule exchange play the crucial role\nin stabilizing the spin-triplet superconducting state. A sizable hybridization\nof the bands suppresses the paired state.\n", "  Exact analytical solutions to the dissipative time-dependent Schr\\\"odinger\nequation are obtained for a decaying two-state system with decay rates\n$\\Gamma_{1}$ and $\\Gamma_{2}$ for levels with extremal spin projections. The\nsystem is coherently driven with a pulse whose detuning is made up of two\nparts: a time-dependent part (chirp) of hyperbolic-tangent shape and a static\npart with real and imaginary terms. This gives us a wide range of possibilities\nto arbitrarily select the interaction terms. We considered two versions which\nled to decaying Demkov-Kunike (DK) models; the version in which the Rabi\nfrequency (interaction) is a time-dependent hyperbolic-secant function (called\ndecaying DK1 model) and the case when it is constant in time and never turns\noff (decaying DK2 model). Our analytical solutions account for all possible\ninitial moments instead of only $t_{0}=0$ or $t_{0}=-\\infty$ as for\nnon-decaying models and may be useful for experiments on level crossings. Two\ncomplementary limits of the pulse detuning are considered and explored: the\nlimit of fast (i) and slow rise (ii). In the case (i), the coupling between\nlevel positions in the first DK model collapses while the second DK model\nreduces to a Rabi model (constant Hamiltonian), in the case (ii), both DK\nmodels reduce to the LZ model. In both cases (i) and (ii), analytical\napproximated solutions which conveniently approach the exact solutions are\nderived.\n", "  More general probability sum-rules for describing interference than found in\nquantum mechanics (QM) were formulated by Sorkin in a hierarchy of such rules.\nThe additivity of classical measure theory corresponds to the second sum-rule.\nQM violates this rule, but satisfies the third and higher sum-rules. This\nevokes the question of whether there are physical principles that forbid their\nviolation. We show that under certain assumptions, violation of higher\nsum-rules allows for superluminal signaling.\n", "  Super-luminous supernovae that radiate more than 10^44 ergs per second at\ntheir peak luminosity have recently been discovered in faint galaxies at\nredshifts of 0.1-4. Some evolve slowly, resembling models of 'pair-instability'\nsupernovae. Such models involve stars with original masses 140-260 times that\nof the Sun that now have carbon-oxygen cores of 65-30 solar masses. In these\nstars, the photons that prevent gravitational collapse are converted to\nelectron-positron pairs, causing rapid contraction and thermonuclear\nexplosions. Many solar masses of 56Ni are synthesized; this isotope decays to\n56Fe via 56Co, powering bright light curves. Such massive progenitors are\nexpected to have formed from metal-poor gas in the early Universe. Recently,\nsupernova 2007bi in a galaxy at redshift 0.127 (about 12 billion years after\nthe Big Bang) with a metallicity one-third that of the Sun was observed to look\nlike a fading pair-instability supernova. Here we report observations of two\nslow-to-fade super-luminous supernovae that show relatively fast rise times and\nblue colours, which are incompatible with pair-instability models. Their\nlate-time light-curve and spectral similarities to supernova 2007bi call the\nnature of that event into question. Our early spectra closely resemble typical\nfast-declining super-luminous supernovae, which are not powered by\nradioactivity. Modelling our observations with 10-16 solar masses of\nmagnetar-energized ejecta demonstrates the possibility of a common explosion\nmechanism. The lack of unambiguous nearby pair-instability events suggests that\ntheir local rate of occurrence is less than 6x10^-6 times that of the\ncore-collapse rate.\n", "  A high-order accurate, explicit kernel-split, panel-based, Fourier-Nystr\\\"om\ndiscretization scheme is developed for integral equations associated with the\nHelmholtz equation in axially symmetric domains. Extensive incorporation of\nanalytic information about singular integral kernels and on-the-fly computation\nof nearly singular quadrature rules allow for very high achievable accuracy,\nalso in the evaluation of fields close to the boundary of the computational\ndomain.\n", "  We consider the $\\theta$-deformed quantum three sphere $S^3_\\theta$ and study\nits Chern--Simons theory from a spectral point of view. We first construct a\nspectral triple on $S^3_\\theta$ as a generalization of the Dirac geometry on\n$S^3 $. Since the choice of Dirac operator is not unique, we give two more\nnatural spectral triples on $S^3_\\theta$ related to the standard round metric.\nWe then compute the Chern--Simons action with respect to the three spectral\ntriples, it turns out that it is not a topological invariant, that is, it\ndepends on the choice of Dirac operators.\n", "  To any solution of a linear system of differential equations, we associate a\nkernel, correlators satisfying a set of loop equations, and in presence of\nisomonodromic parameters, a Tau function. We then study their semiclassical\nexpansion (WKB type expansion in powers of the weight hbar per derivative) of\nthese quantities. When this expansion is of topological type (TT), the\ncoefficients of expansions are computed by the topological recursion with\ninitial data given by the semiclassical spectral curve of the linear system.\nThis provides an efficient algorithm to compute them at least when the\nsemiclassical spectral curve is of genus 0. TT is a non trivial property, and\nit is an open problem to find a criterion which guarantees it is satisfied. We\nprove TT and illustrate our construction for the linear systems associated to\nthe q-th reductions of KP - which contain the (p,q) models as a specialization.\n", "  $Sp(2M)$ invariant field equations in the space ${\\cal M}_M$ with symmetric\nmatrix coordinates are classified. Analogous results are obtained for\nMinkowski-like subspaces of ${\\cal M}_M$ which include usual $4d$ Minkowski\nspace as a particular case. The constructed equations are associated with the\ntensor products of the Fock (singleton) representation of $Sp(2M)$ of any rank\n${\\mathbf{r }}$. The infinite set of higher-spin conserved currents multilinear\nin rank-one fields in ${\\cal M}_M$ is found. The associated conserved charges\nare supported by $({\\mathbf{r }} M-\\frac{{\\mathbf{r }} ({\\mathbf{r }}\n-1)}{2})-$dimensional differential forms in ${\\cal M}_M$, that are closed by\nvirtue of the rank-$2{\\mathbf{r }}$ field equations. The cohomology groups\n$H^p(\\sigma^{\\mathbf{r }}_-)$ with all $p$ and ${\\mathbf{r }}$, which determine\nthe form of appropriate gauge fields and their field equations, are found both\nfor ${\\cal M}_M$ and for its Minkowski-like subspace.\n", "  The eXciting Dark Matter (XDM) model was proposed as a mechanism to\nefficiently convert the kinetic energy (in sufficiently hot environments) of\ndark matter into e+e- pairs. The standard scenario invokes a doublet of nearly\ndegenerate DM states, and a dark force to mediate a large upscattering cross\nsection between the two. For heavy ($\\sim TeV$) DM, the kinetic energy of WIMPs\nin large (galaxy-sized or larger) halos is capable of producing low-energy\npositrons. For lighter dark matter, this is kinematically impossible, and the\nunique observable signature becomes an X-ray line, arising from $\\chi \\chi\n\\rightarrow \\chi^* \\chi^*$, followed by $\\chi^* \\rightarrow \\chi \\gamma$. This\nvariant of XDM is distinctive from other DM X-ray scenarios in that it tends to\nbe most present in more massive, hotter environments, such as clusters, rather\nthan nearby dwarfs, and has different dependencies from decaying models. We\nfind that it is capable of explaining the recently reported X-ray line at 3.56\nkeV. For very long lifetimes of the excited state, primordial decays can\nexplain the signal without the presence of upscattering. Thermal models\nfreeze-out as in the normal XDM setup, via annihilations to the light boson\n$\\phi$. For suitable masses the annihilation $\\chi \\chi \\rightarrow \\phi \\phi$\nfollowed by $\\phi \\rightarrow SM$ can explain the reported gamma-ray signature\nfrom the galactic center. Direct detection is discussed, including the\npossibility of explaining DAMA via the \"Luminous\" dark matter approach. Quite\ngenerally, the proximity of the 3.56 keV line to the energy scale of DAMA\nmotivates a reexamination of electromagnetic explanations. Other signals,\nincluding lepton jets and the modification of cores of dwarf galaxies are also\nconsidered.\n", "  The elliptic flow splitting between particles and their antiparticles has\nrecently been observed by the STAR Collaboration in the beam-energy scan\nprogram at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider. In studies based on transport\nmodels, we have found that this splitting can be explained by the different\nmean-field potentials acting on particles and their antiparticles in the\nproduced baryon-rich matter. In particular, we have shown that the\nexperimentally measured relative elliptic flow difference can help constrain\nthe vector coupling constant in the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model used in describing\nthe partonic stage of heavy-ion collisions. This information is useful for\nlocating the critical point in the QCD phase diagram and thus understanding the\nphase structure of QCD.\n", "  Spin-transfer torques induced by temperature gradients in conducting\nferromagnets are calculated microscopically for smooth magnetization textures.\nTemperature gradients are treated a la Luttinger by introducing a fictitious\ngravitational field that couples to the energy density. The thermal torque\ncoefficients obtained by the Kubo formula contain divergences caused by\nequilibrium components that should be subtracted before applying the\nEinstein-Luttinger relation. Only by following this procedure a familiar\nMott-like formula is obtained for the dissipative spin-transfer torque. The\nresult indicates that a fictitious field coupled to the entropy rather than\nenergy would solve the issue from the outset.\n", "  Since the discovery a century ago, spin describing the intrinsic angular\nmomentum of massive elementary particles has exposed its nature and significant\nroles in wide ranges of (relativistic) quantum phenomena and practical\napplications for future quantum technology. Emerging inconsistencies have also\ndisclosed its telltale incomplete description. Finding relativistic spins\n(operators) of massive particles is a long-standing fundamental problem from\nthe beginning of relativistic quantum mechanics. Here we present the rigorous\nderivation and the representation of spin operators from the spacetime\nsymmetry. The covariant parity operation, defined by the spin operators,\nnaturally leads to a fundamental equation equivalent to the covariant Dirac\nequation, which manifests existent relativistic spins. Proper understanding\nposition operator in the Dirac theory on account of the spin operator through\ntotal angular momentum predicts no Zitterbewegung as well as conserving orbital\nand spin currents. The spin operators can be applicable for unraveling the\ninconsistencies and for exploring unveiled physics of massive particles.\n", "  The superposition principle is usually incorrectly applied in interference\nexperiments. This has recently been investigated through numerics based on\nFinite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) methods as well as the Feynman path\nintegral formalism. In the current work, we have derived an analytic formula\nfor the Sorkin parameter which can be used to determine the deviation from the\napplication of the principle. We have found excellent agreement between the\nanalytic distribution and those that have been earlier estimated by numerical\nintegration as well as resource intensive FDTD simulations. The analytic handle\nwould be useful for comparing theory with future experiments. It is applicable\nboth to physics based on classical wave equations as well as the\nnon-relativistic Schrodinger equation.\n", "  A general treatment of ultracold two-body scattering in the presence of\nisotropic spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is presented. Owing to the mixing of\ndifferent partial wave channels, scattering with SOC is in general a coupled\nmultichannel problem. A systematic method is introduced to analytically solve a\nclass of coupled differential equations by recasting the coupled channel\nproblem as a simple eigenvalue problem. The exact Green's matrix in the\npresence of SOC is found, which readily gives the scattering solutions for any\ntwo identical particles in any total angular momentum subspace having\nnegligible center of mass momentum. Application of this formalism to two spin-1\nbosons shows the ubiquitous low energy threshold behavior for systems with\nisotropic SOC. A modified threshold behavior shows up, which does not occur for\nthe spin-orbit coupled spin-1/2 system. We also confirm the parity-breaking\nmechanism for the spontaneous emergency of handedness, that has been proposed\nby Duan et. al. [1]. Additionally, a two-body bound state is found for any\narbitrarily small and negative scattering length. Our study sheds light on the\nfew-body side of SOC physics and provides one step towards understanding\nultracold scattering in a non-Abelian gauge field.\n", "  Network science have constantly been in the focus of research for the last\ndecade, with considerable advances in the controllability of their structural.\nHowever, much less effort has been devoted to study that how to improve the\ncontrollability of complex networks. In this paper, a new algorithm is proposed\nto improve the controllability of complex networks by rewiring links regularly\nwhich transforms the network structure. Then it is demonstrated that our\nalgorithm is very effective after numerical simulation experiment on typical\nnetwork models (Erd\\\"os-R\\'enyi and scale-free network). We find that our\nalgorithm is mainly determined by the average degree and positive correlation\nof in-degree and out-degree of network and it has nothing to do with the\nnetwork size. Furthermore, we analyze and discuss the correlation between\ncontrollability of complex networks and degree distribution index: power-law\nexponent and heterogeneity\n", "  The focus of this paper is on the analysis of a semi-infinite crack lying\nalong a perfect interface in a piezoelectric bimaterial with arbitrary loading\non the crack faces. Making use of the extended Stroh formalism for\npiezoelectric materials combined with Riemann-Hilbert formulation, general\nexpressions are obtained for both symmetric and skew-symmetric weight functions\nassociate with plane crack problems at the interface between dissimilar\nanisotropic piezoelectric media. The effect of the coupled electrical fields is\nincorporated in the derived original expressions for the weight function\nmatrices. These matrices are used together with Betti's reciprocity identity in\norder to obtain singular integral equations relating the extended displacement\nand traction fields to the loading acting on the crack faces. In order to study\nthe variation of the piezoelectric effect, two different poling directions are\nconsidered. Examples are shown for both poling directions with a number of\nmechanical and electrical loadings applied to the crack faces.\n", "  We theoretically show the negative refraction existing in M\\\"{o}bius\nmolecules. The negative refractive index is induced by the non-trivial topology\nof the molecules. With the M\\\"{o}bius boundary condition, the effective\nelectromagnetic fields felt by the electron in a M\\\"{o}bius ring is spatially\ninhomogeneous. In this regard, the $D_{N}$ symmetry is broken in M\\\"{o}bius\nmolecules and thus the magnetic response is induced through the effective\nmagnetic field. Our findings open up a new architecture for negative refractive\nindex materials based on the non-trivial topology of M\\\"{o}bius molecules.\n", "  In the early 1970s, after a slow start, and lots of hurdles, Quantum Field\nTheory emerged as the superior doctrine for understanding the interactions\nbetween relativistic sub-atomic particles. After the conditions for a\nrelativistic field theoretical model to be renormalizable were established,\nthere were two other developments that quickly accelerated acceptance of this\napproach: first the Brout-Englert-Higgs mechanism, and then asymptotic freedom.\nTogether, these gave us a complete understanding of the perturbative sector of\nthe theory, enough to give us a detailed picture of what is now usually called\nthe Standard Model. Crucial for this understanding were the strong indications\nand encouragements provided by numerous experimental findings. Subsequently,\nnon-perturbative features of the quantum field theories were addressed, and the\nfirst proposals for completely unified quantum field theories were launched.\nSince the use of continuous symmetries of all sorts, together with other topics\nof advanced mathematics, were recognised to be of crucial importance, many new\npredictions were pointed out, such as the Higgs particle, supersymmetry and\nbaryon number violation. There are still many challenges ahead.\n", "  The test of the electroweak corrections has played a major role in providing\nevidence for the gauge and the Higgs sectors of the Standard Model. At the same\ntime the consideration of the electroweak corrections has given significant\nindirect information on the masses of the top and the Higgs boson before their\ndiscoveries and important orientation/constraints on the searches for new\nphysics, still highly valuable in the present situation.The progression of\nthese contributions is reviewed.\n", "  We show that the one-dimensional extended Hubbard model has saturated\nferromagnetic ground states with the spin-triplet electron pair condensation in\na certain range of parameters. The ground state wave functions with fixed\nelectron numbers are explicitly obtained. We also construct two ground states\nin which both the spin-rotation and the gauge symmetries are broken, and show\nthat these states are transferred from one to the other by applying the edge\noperators. The edge operators are reduced to the Majorana fermions in a special\ncase. These symmetry breaking ground states are shown to be stabilized by a\nsuperconducting mean field Hamiltonian which is related to the Kitaev chain\nwith the charge-charge interaction.\n", "  Band structure is theoretically studied in partially flattened carbon\nnanotubes within an effective-mass scheme. Effects of inter-wall interactions\nare shown to be important in non-chiral nanotubes such as zigzag and armchair\nand can essentially be neglected in chiral nanotubes except in the close\nvicinity of non-chiral tubes. In fact, inter-wall interactions significantly\nmodify states depending on relative displacement in the flattened region in\nnon-chiral tubes and can convert semiconducting tubes into metallic and vice\nversa. They diminish rapidly when the chiral angle deviates from that of the\nzigzag or armchair tube, although the decay is slower in the vicinity of\narmchair tubes.\n", "  We develop a construction of the unitary type anti-involution for the\nquantized differential calculus over $GL_q(n)$ in the case $|q|=1$. To this\nend, we consider a joint associative algebra of quantized functions,\ndifferential forms and Lie derivatives over $GL_q(n)/SL_q(n)$, which is\nbicovariant with respect to $GL_q(n)/SL_q(n)$ coactions. We define a specific\nnon-central {\\em spectral extension} of this algebra by the spectral variables\nof three matrices of the algebra generators. In the spectrally expended algebra\nwe construct three-parametric family of its inner automorphisms. These\nautomorphisms are used for construction of the unitary anti-involution for the\n(spectrally extended) calculus over $GL_q(n)$.\n", "  This essay is intended to provide a brief description of the peculiar\nproperties of neutrinos within and beyond the standard theory of weak\ninteractions. The focus is on the flavor oscillations of massive neutrinos,\nfrom which one has achieved some striking knowledge about their mass spectrum\nand flavor mixing pattern. The experimental prospects towards probing the\nabsolute neutrino mass scale, possible Majorana nature and CP-violating effects\nwill also be addressed.\n", "  In this paper we investigate the one-dimensional parabolic-parabolic\nPatlak-Keller-Segel model of chemotaxis. For the case when the diffusion\ncoefficient of chemical substance is equal to two, in terms of travelling wave\nvariables the reduced system appears integrable and allows the analytical\nsolution. We obtain the exact soliton solutions, one of which is exactly the\none-soliton solution of the Korteweg-de Vries equation.\n", "  The Higgs boson was postulated in 1964, and phenomenological studies of its\npossible production and decays started in the early 1970s, followed by studies\nof its possible production in electron-positron, antiproton-proton and\nproton-proton collisions, in particular. Until recently, the most sensitive\nsearches for the Higgs boson were at LEP between 1989 and 2000, which were\ncomplemented by searches at the Fermilab Tevatron. Then the LHC experiments\nATLAS and CMS entered the hunt, announcing on July 4, 2012 the discovery of a\n\"Higgs-like\" particle with a mass of about 125~GeV. This identification has\nbeen supported by subsequent measurements of its spin, parity and coupling\nproperties. It was widely anticipated that the Higgs boson would be accompanied\nby supersymmetry, although other options, like compositeness, were not\ncompletely excluded. So far there are no signs any new physics, and the\nmeasured properties of the Higgs boson are consistent with the predictions of\nthe minimal Standard Model. This article reviews some of the key historical\ndevelopments in Higgs physics over the past half-century.\n", "  The optical properties of PT-symmetric periodic stack of the layers with\nbalanced loss and gain are examined. We demonstrate that tunnelling phenomenon\nin periodic structures is connected with excitation of surface waves at the\nboundaries separating gain and loss regions within each unit cell and\ntunnelling conditions for periodic stack can be reduced to the conditions for\none period. Alternatively, it is shown that coherent perfect absorber laser\nstates are mediated by excitation of surface modes localised at all internal\nboundaries of the structure. The effects of the structure parameters and angle\nand direction of incidence on the resonant phenomena and spontaneous symmetry\nbreaking transition are determined. It is shown that structure periodicity\nsignificantly increases the number of resonant phenomena, especially in stacks\nwith high real and imaginary parts of dielectric permittivity of the layers.\nGaussian beam dynamics in this type of structure is examined. The beam\nsplitting in PT-symmetric periodic structure is observed.\n", "  A recent search for the lepton flavor violating (LFV) decays of the Higgs\nboson, performed by CMS collaboration, reports an interesting deviation from\nthe standard model (SM). The search conducted in the channel $H\\rightarrow\n\\mu\\tau_e$ and $H\\rightarrow \\mu\\tau_{\\textrm{had}}$ shows an excess of\n$2.4\\sigma$ signal events with 19.7 fb$^{-1}$ data at a center-of-mass energy\n$\\sqrt s=8$ TeV. On the other hand, a search performed by CMS collaboration for\nthe SM Higgs boson produced in association with a top quark pair ($t\\bar t H$)\nalso showed an excess in the same-sign di-muon final state. In this work we try\nto find out if these two seemingly uncorrelated excesses are related or not.\nOur analysis reveals that a lepton flavour violating Higgs decay\n($H\\rightarrow\\mu\\tau$) can partially explain the excess in the same sign\ndi-muon final state in the $t\\bar t H$ search, infact brings down the excess\nwell within 2$\\sigma$ error of the SM expectation. Probing such non-standard\nHiggs boson decay is of interest and might contain hints of new physics at the\nelectroweak scale.\n", "  We study finite-dimensional integrals in a way that elucidates the\nmathematical meaning behind the formal manipulations of path integrals\noccurring in quantum field theory. This involves a proper understanding of how\nWick's theorem allows one to evaluate integrals perturbatively, i.e., as a\nseries expansion in a formal parameter irrespective of convergence properties.\nWe establish invariance properties of such a Wick expansion under coordinate\nchanges and the action of a Lie group of symmetries, and we use this to study\nessential features of path integral manipulations, including coordinate\nchanges, Ward identities, Schwinger-Dyson equations, Faddeev-Popov\ngauge-fixing, and eliminating fields by their equation of motion. We also\ndiscuss the asymptotic nature of the Wick expansion and the implications this\nhas for defining path integrals perturbatively and nonperturbatively.\n", "  We use persistent homology to build a quantitative understanding of large\ncomplex systems that are driven far-from-equilibrium; in particular, we analyze\nimage time series of flow field patterns from numerical simulations of two\nimportant problems in fluid dynamics: Kolmogorov flow and Rayleigh-B\\'enard\nconvection. For each image we compute a persistence diagram to yield a reduced\ndescription of the flow field; by applying different metrics to the space of\npersistence diagrams, we relate characteristic features in persistence diagrams\nto the geometry of the corresponding flow patterns. We also examine the\ndynamics of the flow patterns by a second application of persistent homology to\nthe time series of persistence diagrams. We demonstrate that persistent\nhomology provides an effective method both for quotienting out symmetries in\nfamilies of solutions and for identifying multiscale recurrent dynamics. Our\napproach is quite general and it is anticipated to be applicable to a broad\nrange of open problems exhibiting complex spatio-temporal behavior.\n", "  The behavior and properties of neutrinos in non-uniform nuclear matter,\nsurrounded by electrons and other neutrinos are studied. The nuclear matter\nitself is modeled by the non-linear Walecka model, where the so-called nuclear\npasta phase is described using the Thomas-Fermi approximation, solved in a\nWigner-Seitz cell. We obtain the total cross-section and mean-free path for the\nneutrinos, taking into account scattering and neutrino absorption, and compare\nthe final results for two known kind of model parametrizations: one in which\nnon-linear effects in the strong sector are explicitly written in the model\nLagrangian and another one in which the coupling constants are density\ndependent. The solution for this problem is important for the understanding of\nneutrino diffusion in a newly born neutron star after a supernova explosion.\n", "  We consider the Schr\\\"odinger--Poisson--Newton equations for crystals with a\ncubic lattice and one ion per cell. We linearize this dynamics at the ground\nstate and introduce a novel class of the ion charge densities which provide the\nstability of the linearized dynamics. This is the first result on linear\nstability for crystals.\n  Our key result is the {\\it energy positivity} for the Bloch generators of the\nlinearized dynamics under a Wiener-type condition on the ion charge density. We\nalso assume an additional condition which cancels the negative contribution\ncaused by electrostatic instability.\n  The proof of the energy positivity relies on a special factorization of the\ncorresponding Hamilton functional. We show that the energy positivity can fail\nif the additional condition breaks down while the Wiener condition holds.\n  The Bloch generators are nonselfadjoint (and even nonsymmetric) Hamilton\noperators. We diagonalize these generators using our theory of spectral\nresolution of the Hamilton ope\\-rators {\\it with positive definite energy}\n\\ci{KK2014a,KK2014b}. Using this spectral resolution, we establish the\nstability of the linearized crystal dynamics.\n", "  We study the connection between N = 2 supersymmetric gauge theories, quantum\ncohomology and quantum integrable systems of hydrodynamic type. We consider\ngauge theories on ALE spaces of A and D-type and discuss how they describe the\nquantum cohomology of the corresponding Nakajima's quiver varieties. We also\ndiscuss how the exact evaluation of local BPS observables in the gauge theory\ncan be used to calculate the spectrum of quantum Hamiltonians of spin Calogero\nintegrable systems and spin Intermediate Long Wave hydrodynamics. This is\nexplicitly obtained by a Bethe Ansatz Equation provided by the quiver gauge\ntheory in terms of its adjacency matrix.\n", "  We investigate multi-electron effects in strong-field ionization of Helium\nusing a semi-classical model that, unlike other commonly used theoretical\napproaches, takes into account electron-electron correlation. Our approach has\nan additional advantage of allowing to selectively switch off different\ncontributions from the parent ion (such as the remaining electron or the\nnuclear charge) and thereby investigate in detail how the final electron angle\nin the attoclock experiment is influenced by these contributions. We find that\nthe bound electron exerts a significant effect on the final electron momenta\ndistribution that can, however, be accounted for by an appropriately selected\nmean field. Our results show excellent agreement with other widely used\ntheoretical models done within a single active electron approximation.\n", "  Based on the Nagel-Schreckenberg (NS) model with periodic boundary\nconditions, we proposed the NSOS model by adding the overtaking strategy (OS).\nIn our model, overtaking vehicles are randomly selected with probability $q$ at\neach time step, and the successful overtaking is determined by their\nvelocities. We observed that (i) traffic jams still occur in the NSOS model;\n(ii) OS increases the traffic flow in the regime where the densities exceed the\nmaximum flow density. We also studied the phase transition (from free flow\nphase to jammed phase) of the NSOS model by analyzing the overtaking success\nrate, order parameter, relaxation time and correlation function, respectively.\nIt was shown that the NSOS model differs from the NS model mainly in the jammed\nregime, and the influence of OS on the transition density is dominated by the\nbraking probability $p$\n", "  The strong coupling constant is one of the fundamental parameters of the\nstandard model of particle physics. In this review I will briefly summarise the\ntheoretical framework, within which the strong coupling constant is defined and\nhow it is connected to measurable observables. Then I will give an historical\noverview of its experimental determinations and discuss the current status and\nworld average value. Among the many different techniques used to determine this\ncoupling constant in the context of quantum chromodynamics, I will focus in\nparticular on a number of measurements carried out at the Large Electron\nPositron Collider (LEP) and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN.\n", "  Radio observations at multiple frequencies have detected a significant\nisotropic emission component between 22~MHz and 10~GHz, commonly termed the\nARCADE-2 Excess. The origin of this radio emission is unknown, as the\nintensity, spectrum and isotropy of the signal are difficult to model with\neither traditional astrophysical mechanisms or novel physics such as dark\nmatter annihilation. We posit a new model capable of explaining the key\ncomponents of the excess radio emission. Specifically, we show that the\nre-acceleration of non-thermal electrons via turbulence in merging galaxy\nclusters are capable of explaining the intensity, spectrum, and isotropy of the\nARCADE-2 data. We examine the parameter spaces of cluster re-acceleration,\nmagnetic field, and merger rate, finding that the radio excess can be\nreproduced assuming reasonable assumptions for each. Finally, we point out that\nfuture observations will definitively confirm or rule-out the contribution of\ncluster mergers to the isotropic radio background.\n", "  Following the recent success of anisotropic hydrodynamics we propose a new,\ngeneral prescription for the hydrodynamics expansion around an anisotropic\nbackground. The anisotropic distribution is fixing exactly the complete\nenergy-momentum tensor, just like the effective temperature is fixing the\nproper energy density in the ordinary expansion around local equilibrium. This\nmeans that momen- tum anisotropies are already included at the leading order,\nallowing for large pressure anisotropies without the need of a next to leading\norder treatment. The first moment of the Boltzmann equation (local\nfour-momentum conservation) provides the time evolution of the proper energy\ndensity and the four velocity. Differently from previous prescriptions, the\ndynamic equations for the pressure corrections are not derived from the zeroth\nor second moment of the Boltzmann equation, but they are taken directly from\nthe exact evolution given by the Boltzmann equation. We check the effec-\ntiveness of this new approach by matching with the exact solution of the\nBoltzmann equation in the Bjorken limit with the collisional kernel treated in\nrelaxation time approximation, finding an unprecedented agreement.\n", "  We derive a general criterion to detect entangled states in multi-partite\nsystems based on the symmetric logarithmic derivative quantum Fisher\ninformation. This criterion is a direct consequence of the fact that separable\nstates do not improve the accuracy upon estimating one-parameter family of\nquantum channels. Our result is a generalization of the previously known\ncriterion for one-parameter unitary channel to any one-parameter quantum\nchannel. We discuss several examples to illustrate our criterion. The proposed\ncriterion is extended to the case of open quantum systems and we briefly\ndiscuss how to detect entangled states in the presence of decoherence.\n", "  The Standard Model may be included within a supersymmetric theory,\npostulating new sparticles that differ by half-a-unit of spin from their\nstandard model partners, and by a new quantum number called R-parity. The\nlightest one, usually a neutralino, is expected to be stable and a possible\ncandidate for dark matter.\n  The electroweak breaking requires two doublets, leading to several charged\nand neutral Brout- Englert-Higgs bosons. This also leads to gauge/Higgs\nunification by providing extra spin-0 partners for the spin-1 W$^\\pm$ and Z. It\noffers the possibility to view, up to a mixing angle, the new 125 GeV boson as\nthe spin-0 partner of the Z under two supersymmetry transformations, i.e. as a\nZ that would be deprived of its spin. Supersymmetry then relates two existing\nparticles of different spins, in spite of their different gauge symmetry\nproperties, through supersymmetry transformations acting on physical fields in\na non-polynomial way.\n  We also discuss how the compactification of extra dimensions, relying on\nR-parity and other discrete symmetries, may determine both the\nsupersymmetry-breaking and grand-unification scales\n", "  We study the evolution of primordial magnetic fields in an expanding cosmic\nplasma. For this purpose we present a comprehensive theoretical model to\nconsider the evolution of MHD turbulence that can be used over a wide range of\nphysical conditions, including cosmological and astrophysical applications. We\nmodel different types of decaying cosmic MHD turbulence in the expanding\nuniverse and characterize the large-scale magnetic fields in such a medium.\nDirect numerical simulations of freely decaying MHD turbulence are performed\nfor different magnetogenesis scenarios: magnetic fields generated during cosmic\ninflation as well as electroweak and QCD phase transitions in the early\nuniverse.\n  Magnetic fields and fluid motions are strongly coupled due to the high\nReynolds number in the early universe. Hence, we abandon the simple adiabatic\ndilution model to estimate magnetic field amplitudes in the expanding universe\nand include turbulent mixing effects on the large-scale magnetic field\nevolution. Numerical simulations have been carried out for non-helical and\nhelical magnetic field configurations. The numerical results show the\npossibility of inverse transfer of energy in magnetically dominated non-helical\nMHD turbulence. On the other hand, decay properties of helical turbulence\ndepend on whether the turbulent magnetic field is in a weakly or a fully\nhelical state.\n  Our results show that primordial magnetic fields can be considered as a seed\nfor the observed large-scale magnetic fields in galaxies and clusters. Bounds\non the magnetic field strength are obtained and are consistent with the upper\nand lower limits set by observations of extragalactic magnetic fields.\n", "  We survey some of the AGT relations between N=2 gauge theories in four\ndimensions and geometric representations of symmetry algebras of\ntwo-dimensional conformal field theory on the equivariant cohomology of their\ninstanton moduli spaces. We treat the cases of gauge theories on both flat\nspace and ALE spaces in some detail, and with emphasis on the implications\narising from embedding them into supersymmetric theories in six dimensions.\nAlong the way we construct new toric noncommutative ALE spaces using the\ngeneral theory of complex algebraic deformations of toric varieties, and\nindicate how to generalise the construction of instanton moduli spaces. We also\ncompute the equivariant partition functions of topologically twisted\nsix-dimensional Yang-Mills theory with maximal supersymmetry in a general\nOmega-background, and use the construction to obtain novel reductions to\ntheories in four dimensions.\n", "  Flavour physics represents one of the most interesting and, at the same time,\nless understood sector of the Standard Theory. On the one hand, the peculiar\npattern of quark and lepton masses, and their mixing angles, may be the clue to\nsome new dynamics occurring at high-energy scales. On the other hand, the\nstrong suppression of flavour-changing neutral-current processes, predicted by\nthe Standard Theory and confirmed by experiments, represents a serious\nchallenge to extend the Theory. This article reviews both these aspects of\nflavour physics from a theoretical perspective.\n", "  (Li0.8Fe0.2)OHFeSe is a newly-discovered intercalated iron-selenide\nsuperconductor with a Tc above 40 K, which is much higher than the Tc of bulk\nFeSe (8 K). Here we report a systematic study of (Li0.8Fe0.2)OHFeSe by low\ntemperature scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). We observed two kinds of\nsurface terminations, namely FeSe and (Li0.8Fe0.2)OH surfaces. On the FeSe\nsurface, the superconducting state is fully gapped with double coherence peaks,\nand a vortex core state with split peaks near EF is observed. Through\nquasi-particle interference (QPI) measurements, we clearly observed intra- and\ninter-pocket scatterings in between the electron pockets at the M point, as\nwell as some evidence of scattering that connects gamma and M points. Upon\napplying magnetic field, the QPI intensity of all the scattering channels are\nfound to behave similarly. Furthermore, we studied impurity effects on the\nsuperconductivity by investigating intentionally introduced impurities and\nintrinsic defects. We observed that magnetic impurities such as Cr adatoms can\ninduce in-gap states and suppress superconductivity. However, nonmagnetic\nimpurities such as Zn adatoms do not induce visible in-gap states. Meanwhile,\nwe show that Zn adatoms can induce in-gap states in thick FeSe films, which is\nbelieved to have an (s+-)wave pairing symmetry. Our experimental results\nsuggest it is likely that (Li0.8Fe0.2)OHFeSe is a plain s-wave superconductor,\nwhose order parameter has the same sign on all Fermi surface sections.\n", "  Within the framework of inverse seesaw mechanism we investigate neutrino mass\nmatrices invariant under cyclic symmetry ($Z_3$) with maximal zero texture (6\nzero textures). We explore two different approaches to obtain the cyclic\nsymmetry invariant form of the constituent matrices. In the first one we\nconsider explicit cyclic symmetry in the neutrino sector of the Lagrangian\nwhich dictates the emerged effective neutrino mass matrix ($m_\\nu$) to be\nsymmetry invariant and hence leads to a degeneracy in masses. We then consider\nexplicit breaking of the symmetry through a dimensionless parameter\n$\\epsilon^{\\prime}$ to remove the degeneracy. It is seen that the method\ndoesn't support the current neutrino oscillation global fit data even after\nconsidering the correction from cyclic symmetry invariant charged lepton mass\nmatrix ($m_l$) unless the breaking parameter is too large. In the second\nmethod, we assume the same forms of the neutrino mass matrices, however,\nsymmetry is broken in the charged lepton sector. All the structures of the mass\nmatrices are now dictated by an effective residual symmetry of some larger\nsymmetry group in the Lagrangian. For illustration, we exemplify a toy model\nbased on softly broken $A_4$ symmetry group which leads to one of the\ncombination of $m_l$, $m_D$, $M_{RS}$ and $\\mu$ to generate effective $m_\\nu$.\nAll the emerged mass matrices predict a constraint range of the CP violating\nphases and atmospheric mixing angle along with an inverted hierarchical\nstructure of the neutrino masses. Further, significant predictions on\n$\\beta\\beta0\\nu$ decay parameter $|m_{11}|$ and the sum of the three light\nneutrino masses ($\\Sigma_im_i$) are also obtained.\n", "  Cosmological constraints from galaxy clusters rely on accurate measurements\nof the mass and internal structure of clusters. An important source of\nsystematic uncertainty in cluster mass and structure measurements is the secure\nselection of background galaxies that are gravitationally lensed by clusters.\nThis issue has been shown to be particular severe for faint blue galaxies. We\ntherefore explore the selection of faint blue background galaxies, by reference\nto photometric redshift catalogs derived from the COSMOS survey and our own\nobservations of massive galaxy clusters at z~0.2. We show that methods relying\non photometric redshifts of galaxies in/behind clusters based on observations\nthrough five filters, and on deep 30-band COSMOS photometric redshifts are both\ninadequate to identify safely faint blue background galaxies. This is due to\nthe small number of filters used by the former, and absence of massive galaxy\nclusters at redshifts of interest in the latter. We therefore develop a\npragmatic method to combine both sets of photometric redshifts to select a\npopulation of blue galaxies based purely on photometric analysis. This sample\nyields stacked weak-lensing results consistent with our previously published\nresults based on red galaxies. We also show that the stacked clustercentric\nnumber density profile of these faint blue galaxies is consistent with\nexpectations from consideration of the lens magnification signal of the\nclusters. Indeed, the observed number density of blue background galaxies\nchanges by ~10-30 per cent across the radial range over which other surveys\nassume it to be flat.\n", "  In Monte Carlo integration an accurate and reliable determination of the\nnumerical intregration error is essential. We point out the need for an\nindependent estimate of the error on this error, for which we present an\nunbiased estimator. In contrast to the usual (first-order) error estimator,\nthis second-order estimator can be shown to be not necessarily positive in an\nactual Monte Carlo computation. We propose an alternative and indicate how this\ncan be computed in linear time without risk of large rounding errors. In\naddition, we comment on the relatively very slow convergence of the\nsecond-order error estimate.\n", "  We extend the Lieb-Schupp theorem to the Heisenberg models with higher order\ninteractions on non-frustrated or frustrated finite lattices. These lattices\nare constructed by even numbered rings with or without crossing bonds and have\nreflection symmetry. The results show that all ground states have total spin\nzero in wide interaction parameters region which is not covered with the\nresults of the Marshall-Lieb-Mattis type arguments.\n", "  We consider a model of half-filled bilayer graphene, in which the three\ndominant Slonczewski-Weiss-McClure hopping parameters are retained, in the\npresence of short range interactions. Under a smallness assumption on the\ninteraction strength $U$ as well as on the inter-layer hopping $\\epsilon$, we\nconstruct the ground state in the thermodynamic limit, and prove its\nanalyticity in $U$, uniformly in $\\epsilon$. The interacting Fermi surface is\ndegenerate, and consists of eight Fermi points, two of which are protected by\nsymmetries, while the locations of the other six are renormalized by the\ninteraction, and the effective dispersion relation at the Fermi points is\nconical. The construction reveals the presence of different energy regimes,\nwhere the effective behavior of correlation functions changes qualitatively.\nThe analysis of the crossover between regimes plays an important role in the\nproof of analyticity and in the uniform control of the radius of convergence.\nThe proof is based on a rigorous implementation of fermionic renormalization\ngroup methods, including determinant estimates for the renormalized expansion.\n", "  This report gives the 2014 self-consistent set of values of the constants and\nconversion factors of physics and chemistry recommended by the Committee on\nData for Science and Technology (CODATA). These values are based on a\nleast-squares adjustment that takes into account all data available up to 31\nDecember 2014. The recommended values may also be found on the World Wide Web\nat physics.nist.gov/constants.\n", "  We examine the multiscaling behavior of the normal- and superfluid-velocity\nstructure functions in three-dimensional superfluid turbulence by using a shell\nmodel for the three-dimensional (3D) Hall-Vinen-Bekharevich-Khalatnikov (HVBK)\nequations. Our 3D-HVBK shell model is based on the Gledzer-Okhitani-Yamada\n(GOY) shell model. We examine the dependence of the multiscaling exponents on\nthe normal-fluid fraction and the mutual-friction coefficients. Our extensive\nstudy of the 3D-HVBK shell model shows that the multiscaling behavior of the\nvelocity structure functions in superfluid turbulence is more complicated than\nit is in fluid turbulence.\n", "  We construct a class of codimension-2 solutions in supergravity that realize\nT-folds with arbitrary $O(2,2,\\mathbb{Z})$ monodromy and we develop a geometric\npoint of view in which the monodromy is identified with a product of Dehn\ntwists of an auxiliary surface $\\Sigma$ fibered on a base $\\mathcal{B}$. These\ndefects, that we call T-fects, are identified by the monodromy of the mapping\ntorus obtained by fibering $\\Sigma$ over the boundary of a small disk\nencircling a degeneration. We determine all possible local geometries by\nsolving the corresponding Cauchy-Riemann equations, that imply the equations of\nmotion for a semi-flat metric ansatz. We discuss the relation with the\nF-theoretic approach and we consider a generalization to the T-duality group of\nthe heterotic theory with a Wilson line.\n", "  The dynamics of the release of stored energy during annealing along two\ndifferent crystallographic planes i.e.{111} and {220} in deformed copper have\nbeen investigated using in-situ X-ray diffraction measurements at 458K and 473K\nrespectively. The study has been carried out on 50% and 80% rolled Cu sheets.\nThe microstructures of the rolled samples have been characterised using optical\nmicroscope and Electron Back Scattered Diffraction measurements. The\nmicrostructural parameters were evaluated using Scherrer equation and the\nmodified Rietveld technique from X-ray diffractogram. The stored energy along\ndifferent planes were determined using the modified Stibitz formula from the\nX-ray peak broadening and the bulk stored energy has been evaluated using\ndifferential scanning calorimetry. The process dynamics of recovery and\nrecrystallization as observed through the release of stored energy has been\nmodelled as a second order and first order process respectively.\n", "  We report on the complete OPE series for the 6-gluon MHV and NMHV amplitudes\nin planar $\\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM theory. Namely, we provide a finite coupling\nprediction for all the terms in the expansion of these amplitudes around the\ncollinear limit. These furnish a non-perturbative representation of the full\namplitudes.\n", "  We develop a way of improving complex Langevin dynamics motivated by the\nLefschetz-thimble decomposition of integrals. In our method, arbitrary\nobservables of an original model with multiple Lefschetz thimbles are computed\nby a modified model with a single thimble. We apply our modification method to\na one dimensional integral in which the naive implementation of the complex\nLangevin dynamics fails to reproduce the exact results due to the severe sign\nproblem. We show that the toy model can be modified so that the new model\nconsists of a single Lefschetz thimble. We find that correct results can be\nobtained by the improved complex Langevin dynamics.\n", "  We study the nonequilibrium interplay between disorder and interactions in a\nclosed quantum system. We base our analysis on the notion of dynamical\nstate-space localization, calculated via the Loschmidt echo. Although\nreal-space and state-space localization are independent concepts in general, we\nshow that both perspectives may be directly connected through a specific choice\nof initial states, namely, maximally localized states (ML-states). We show\nnumerically that in the noninteracting case the average echo is found to be\nmonotonically increasing with increasing disorder; these results are in\nagreement with an analytical evaluation in the single particle case in which\nthe echo is found to be inversely proportional to the localization length. We\nalso show that for interacting systems, the length scale under which\nequilibration may occur is upper bounded and such bound is smaller the greater\nthe average echo of ML-states. When disorder and interactions, both being\nlocalization mechanisms, are simultaneously at play the echo features a\nnon-monotonic behaviour indicating a non-trivial interplay of the two\nprocesses. This interplay induces delocalization of the dynamics which is\naccompanied by delocalization in real-space. This non-monotonic behaviour is\nalso present in the effective integrability which we show by evaluating the gap\nstatistics.\n", "  This work is to develop a general framework, namely analytical iterative\nreconstruction (AIR) method, to incorporate analytical reconstruction (AR)\nmethod into iterative reconstruction (IR) method, for enhanced CT image quality\nand reconstruction efficiency. Specifically, AIR is established based on the\nmodified proximal forward-backward splitting (PFBS) algorithm, and its\nconnection to the filtered data fidelity with sparsity regularization is\ndiscussed. As a result, AIR decouples data fidelity and image regularization\nwith a two-step iterative scheme, during which an AR-projection step updates\nthe filtered data fidelity term, while a denoising solver updates the sparsity\nregularization term. During the AR-projection step, the image is projected to\nthe data domain to form the data residual, and then reconstructed by certain AR\nto a residual image which is then weighted together with previous image iterate\nto form next image iterate. Intuitively since the eigenvalues of AR-projection\noperator are close to the unity, PFBS based AIR has a fast convergence. Such an\nadvantage is rigorously established through convergence analysis and numerical\ncomputation of convergence rate. The proposed AIR method is validated in the\nsetting of circular cone-beam CT with AR being FDK and total-variation sparsity\nregularization, and has improved image quality from both AR and IR. For\nexample, AIR has improved visual assessment and quantitative measurement in\nterms of both contrast and resolution, and reduced axial and half-fan\nartifacts.\n", "  In recent years, observational $\\gamma$-ray astronomy has seen a remarkable\nrange of exciting new results in the high-energy and very-high energy regimes.\nCoupled with extensive theoretical and phenomenological studies of non-thermal\nprocesses in the Universe these observations have provided a deep insight into\na number of fundamental problems of high energy astrophysics and astroparticle\nphysics. Although the main moti- vations of $\\gamma$-ray astronomy remain\nunchanged, recent observational results have contributed significantly towards\nour understanding of many related phenomena. This article aims to review the\nmost important results in the young and rapidly developing field of\n$\\gamma$-ray astrophysics.\n", "  Lattice QCD simulations are now reaching a precision where isospin breaking\neffects become important. Previously, we have developed a program to\nsystematically investigate the pattern of flavor symmetry beaking within QCD\nand successfully applied it to meson and baryon masses involving up, down and\nstrange quarks. In this Letter we extend the calculations to QCD + QED and\npresent our first results on isospin splittings in the pseudoscalar meson and\nbaryon octets. In particular, we obtain the nucleon mass difference of\n$M_n-M_p=1.35(18)(8)\\,\\mbox{MeV}$ and the electromagnetic contribution to the\npion splitting $M_{\\pi^+}-M_{\\pi^0}=4.60(20)\\,\\mbox{MeV}$. Further we report\nfirst determination of the separation between strong and electromagnetic\ncontributions in the $\\bar{MS}$ scheme.\n", "  Phase separation mechanisms can produce a variety of complicated and\nintricate microstructures, which often can be difficult to characterize in a\nquantitative way. In recent years, a number of novel topological metrics for\nmicrostructures have been proposed, which measure essential connectivity\ninformation and are based on techniques from algebraic topology. Such metrics\nare inherently computable using computational homology, provided the\nmicrostructures are discretized using a thresholding process. However, while in\nmany cases the thresholding is straightforward, noise and measurement errors\ncan lead to misleading metric values. In such situations, persistence\nlandscapes have been proposed as a natural topology metric. Common to all of\nthese approaches is the enormous data reduction, which passes from complicated\npatterns to discrete information. It is therefore natural to wonder what type\nof information is actually retained by the topology. In the present paper, we\ndemonstrate that averaged persistence landscapes can be used to recover central\nsystem information in the Cahn-Hilliard theory of phase separation. More\nprecisely, we show that topological information of evolving microstructures\nalone suffices to accurately detect both concentration information and the\nactual decomposition stage of a data snapshot. Considering that persistent\nhomology only measures discrete connectivity information, regardless of the\nsize of the topological features, these results indicate that the system\nparameters in a phase separation process affect the topology considerably more\nthan anticipated. We believe that the methods discussed in this paper could\nprovide a valuable tool for relating experimental data to model simulations.\n", "  Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods coupled to WENO algorithms allow high\norder convergence for smooth problems and for the simulation of discontinuities\nand shocks. In this work, we investigate WENO-DG algorithms in the context of\nnumerical general relativity, in particular for general relativistic\nhydrodynamics. We implement the standard WENO method at different orders, a\ncompact (simple) WENO scheme, as well as an alternative subcell evolution\nalgorithm. To evaluate the performance of the different numerical schemes, we\nstudy non-relativistic, special relativistic, and general relativistic\ntestbeds. We present the first three-dimensional simulations of general\nrelativistic hydrodynamics, albeit for a fixed spacetime background, within the\nframework of WENO-DG methods. The most important testbed is a single TOV-star\nin three dimensions, showing that long term stable simulations of single\nisolated neutron stars can be obtained with WENO-DG methods.\n", "  Cosmic ray anisotropy has been observed in a wide energy range and at\ndifferent angular scales by a variety of experiments over the past decade.\nHowever, no comprehensive or satisfactory explanation has been put forth to\ndate. The arrival distribution of cosmic rays at Earth is the convolution of\nthe distribution of their sources and of the effects of geometry and properties\nof the magnetic field through which particles propagate. It is generally\nbelieved that the anisotropy topology at the largest angular scale is\nadiabatically shaped by diffusion in the structured interstellar magnetic\nfield. On the contrary, the medium- and small-scale angular structure could be\nan effect of non-diffusive propagation of cosmic rays in perturbed magnetic\nfields. In particular, a possible explanation of the observed small-scale\nanisotropy observed at TeV energy scale, may come from the effect of particle\nscattering in turbulent magnetized plasmas. We perform numerical integration of\ntest particle trajectories in low-$\\beta$ compressible magnetohydrodynamic\nturbulence to study how the cosmic rays arrival direction distribution is\nperturbed when they stream along the local turbulent magnetic field. We utilize\nLiouville's theorem for obtaining the anisotropy at Earth and provide the\ntheoretical framework for the application of the theorem in the specific case\nof cosmic ray arrival distribution. In this work, we discuss the effects on the\nanisotropy arising from propagation in this inhomogeneous and turbulent\ninterstellar magnetic field.\n", "  A dynamical system is said to undergo rate-induced tipping when it fails to\ntrack its quasi-equilibrium state due to an above-critical-rate change of\nsystem parameters. We study a prototypical model for rate-induced tipping, the\nsaddle-node normal form subject to time-varying equilibrium drift and noise. We\nfind that both most commonly used early-warning indicators, increase in\nvariance and increase in autocorrelation, occur not when the equilibrium drift\nis fastest but with a delay. We explain this delay by demonstrating that the\nmost likely trajectory for tipping also crosses the tipping threshold with a\ndelay and therefore the tipping itself is delayed. We find solutions of the\nvariational problem determining the most likely tipping path using numerical\ncontinuation techniques. The result is a systematic study of the most likely\ntipping time in the plane of two parameters, distance from tipping threshold\nand noise intensity.\n", "  We discuss a scenario of the type-II 2HDM in which the $b\\bar{b}\\gamma\\gamma$\nrate of the Higgs pair production is enhanced due to the two nearly degenerate\n125 GeV Higgs bosons ($h$, $H$). Considering various theoretical and\nexperimental constraints, we figure out the allowed ranges of the trilinear\ncouplings of these two Higgs bosons and calculate the signal rate of\n$b\\bar{b}\\gamma\\gamma$ from the productions of Higgs pairs ($hh$, $hH$, $HH$)\nat the LHC. We find that in the allowed parameter space some trilinear Higgs\ncouplings can be larger than the SM value by an order and the production rate\nof $b\\bar{b}\\gamma\\gamma$ can be greatly enhanced. We also consider a\n\"decoupling\" benchmark point where the light CP-even Higgs has a SM-like cubic\nself-coupling while other trilinear couplings are very small. With a detailed\nsimulation on the $b\\bar{b}\\gamma\\gamma$ signal and backgrounds, we find that\nin such a \"decoupling\" scenario the $hh$ and $hH$ channels can jointly enhance\nthe statistical significance to 5$\\sigma$ at 14 TeV LHC with an integrated\nluminosity of 3000 fb$^{-1}$.\n", "  Using large-scale molecular dynamics simulations for a system of $10^6$\nparticles, the response of a dense amorphous solid to the continuous expansion\nof its volume is investigated. We find that the spatially uniform glassy state\nbecomes unstable via the formation of cavities, which eventually leads to\nfailure. By scanning through a wide range of densities and temperatures, we\ndetermine the state points at which the instability occurs and thereby provide\nestimates of the co-existence density of the resultant glass phase. Evidence\nfor long-lived, inhomogeneous configurations with a negative pressure is found,\nwhere the frozen-in glass structure contains spherical cavities or a network of\nvoid space. Furthermore, we demonstrate the occurrence of hysteretic effects\nwhen the cavitated solid is compressed to regain the dense glassy state. As a\nresult, a new glass state is obtained, the pressure of which is different from\nthe initial one due to small density inhomogeneities that are generated by the\ndilation-compression cycle.\n", "  In this letter we derive an action principle for Coulomb collisions in\nplasmas. Although no natural Lagrangian exists for the Landau-Fokker-Planck\nequation, an Eulerian variational formulation is found considering the system\nof partial differential equations that couple the distribution function and the\nRosenbluth potentials. Exact conservation laws are derived after generalizing\nthe energy-momentum stress tensor for second order Lagrangians and, in the case\nof a test-particle population in a given plasma background, the action\nprinciple is shown to correspond to the Langevin equation for individual\nparticles. Being suitable for discretization, the presented action allows\nconstruction of variational integrators. Numerical implementation is left for a\nfuture study.\n", "  We interpret the relation between the polarizing efficiency $P_{\\max}/E(B-V)$\nand the wavelength of the maximum polarization $\\lambda_{\\max}$ observed for 17\nobjects (including 243 stars) separated into two groups: \"dark clouds\" and\n\"open clusters\". The objects are assigned to one of the groups according to the\ndistribution of the parameter $\\lambda_{\\max}$. We use the model of homogeneous\nsilicate and carbonaceous spheroidal particles with the imperfect alignment and\na time-evolving size distribution. The polarization is assumed to be mainly\nproduced by large silicate particles with the sizes $r_{V} \\ga r_{V,\\rm cut}$.\nThe models with the initial size distribution reproducing the average curve of\nthe interstellar extinction fail to explain the values of $\\lambda_{\\max} \\ga\n0.65\\,\\mkm$ observed for several dark clouds. We assume that the grain size\ndistribution is modified due to accretion and coagulation, according to the\nmodel of Hirashita \\& Voshchinnikov (2014). After including the evolutionary\neffects, $\\lambda_{\\max}$ shifts to longer wavelengths on time-scales $\\sim 20\n(n_\\mathrm{H}/10^3 \\mathrm{cm}^{-3})^{-1}$ Myr where $n_\\mathrm{H}$ is the\nhydrogen density in molecular clouds where dust processing occurs. The ratio\n$P_{\\max}/E(B-V)$ goes down dramatically when the size of polarizing grains\ngrows. The variations of the degree and direction of particle orientation\ninfluence this ratio only moderately. We have also found that the aspect ratio\nof prolate grains does not affect significantly the polarizing efficiency. For\noblate particles, the shape effect is stronger but in most cases the\npolarization curves produced are too narrow in comparison with the observed\nones.\n", "  The \"QCD Kondo effect\" stems from the color exchange interaction in QCD with\nnon-Abelian property, and can be realized in a high-density quark matter\ncontaining heavy-quark impurities. We propose a novel type of the QCD Kondo\neffect induced by a strong magnetic field. In addition to the fact that the\nmagnetic field does not affect the color degrees of freedom, two properties\ncaused by the Landau quantization in a strong magnetic field are essential for\nthe \"magnetically induced QCD Kondo effect\"; (1) dimensional reduction to\n1+1-dimensions, and (2) finiteness of the density of states for lowest energy\nquarks. We demonstrate that, in a strong magnetic field $B$, the scattering\namplitude of a massless quark off a heavy quark impurity indeed shows a\ncharacteristic behavior of the Kondo effect. The resulting Kondo scale is\nestimated as $\\Lambda_{\\rm K} \\simeq \\sqrt{e_qB}\\ \\alpha_{s}^{1/3}\n{\\rm{exp}}\\{-{4}\\pi/N_{c} \\alpha_{s} {\\rm{log}}( 4 \\pi/\\alpha_{s}) \\}$ where\n$\\alpha_{s}$ and $N_c$ are the fine structure constant of strong interaction\nand the number of colors in QCD, and $e_q$ is the electric charge of light\nquarks.\n", "  We study the critical behavior for inhomogeneous versions of the Curie-Weiss\nmodel, where the coupling constant $J_{ij}(\\beta)$ for the edge $ij$ on the\ncomplete graph is given by $J_{ij}(\\beta)=\\beta w_iw_j/(\\sum_{k\\in[N]}w_k)$. We\ncall the product form of these couplings the rank-1 inhomogeneous Curie-Weiss\nmodel. This model also arises (with inverse temperature $\\beta$ replaced by\n$\\sinh(\\beta)$) from the annealed Ising model on the generalized random graph.\nWe assume that the vertex weights $(w_i)_{i\\in[N]}$ are regular, in the sense\nthat their empirical distribution converges and the second moment converges as\nwell. We identify the critical temperatures and exponents for these models, as\nwell as a non-classical limit theorem for the total spin at the critical point.\nThese depend sensitively on the number of finite moments of the weight\ndistribution. When the fourth moment of the weight distribution converges, then\nthe critical behavior is the same as on the (homogeneous) Curie-Weiss model, so\nthat the inhomogeneity is weak. When the fourth moment of the weights converges\nto infinity, and the weights satisfy an asymptotic power law with exponent\n$\\tau$ with $\\tau\\in(3,5)$, then the critical exponents depend sensitively on\n$\\tau$. In addition, at criticality, the total spin $S_{N}$ satisfies that\n$S_{N}/N^{(\\tau-1)/(\\tau-2)}$ converges in law to some limiting random variable\nwhose distribution we explicitly characterize.\n", "  Let $\\mu$ be a measure on the real line $\\mathbb{R}$ such that\n$\\int_{\\mathbb{R}}\\frac{d\\mu(t)}{1+t^2} < \\infty$ and let $a>0$. Assume that\nthe norms $\\|f\\|_{L^2(\\mathbb{R})}$ and $\\|f\\|_{L^2(\\mu)}$ are comparable for\nfunctions $f$ in the Paley-Wiener space $PW_{a}$ and that $PW_a$ is dense in\n$L^2(\\mu)$. We reconstruct the canonical Hamiltonian system $JX' = zHX$ such\nthat $\\mu$ is the spectral measure for this system.\n", "  Very intense neutrino beams and large neutrino detectors will be needed to\nenable the discovery of CP violation in the leptonic sector. The European\nSpallation Source (ESS), currently under construction in Lund, Sweden, is a\nresearch center that will provide, by 2023, the world's most powerful neutron\nsource. The average power will be 5 MW. Pulsing this linac at higher frequency,\nat the same instantaneous power, will make it possible to raise the average\nbeam power to 10 MW to produce, in parallel with the spallation neutron\nproduction, a high performance neutrino Super Beam of about 0.4 GeV mean\nneutrino energy. The ESS neutrino Super Beam, ESSnuSB, operated with a 2.0 GeV\nlinac proton beam, together with a large underground Water Cherenkov detector\nlocated at 540 km from Lund, close to the second oscillation maximum, will make\nit possible to discover leptonic CP violation at 5 sigma significance level in\n56 percent (65 percent for an upgrade to 2.5 GeV beam energy) of the leptonic\nDirac CP-violating phase range after 10 years of data taking. The paper gives\nan overview of the proposed facility and presents the outstanding physics reach\npossible for CP violation with ESSnuSB.\n", "  The evolution equation for inhomogeneous and anisotropic temperature\nfluctuation inside a medium is derived within the ambit of Boltzmann Transport\nEquation (BTE) for a hot gas of massless particles. Also, specializing to a\nsituation created after heavy-ion collision (HIC), we analyze the Fourier space\nvariation of temperature fluctuation of the medium using its temperature\nprofile. The effect of viscosity on the variation of fluctuations in the latter\ncase is investigated and possible implications for early universe cosmology,\nand its connection with HICs are also explored.\n", "  In the last 50 years we have seen how an initially ad-hoc and not widely\naccepted theory of the strong and electroweak interactions (Standard Theory:\nST) has correctly predicted the entire accelerator based experimental\nobservations with incredible accuracy (with the important exception of neutrino\noscillation experiments). Decays of the ST particles (quarks and leptons),\nwhich are rare due to some symmetry of the theory, have played an important\nrole in the formalism of the ST. These rare decays have been powerful tools to\nsearch for new particle interactions with the ST particles, which may not\nnecessarily have the same symmetries. In this article, I will describe the\nindirect search for evidence of new physics (NP) using quark and lepton flavour\nchanging neutral decays, which are highly suppressed within the ST, and\nconstitute strong probes of potential new flavour structures.\n", "  I generalize the theory of phonon topological band structures of isostatic\nlattices to frustrated antiferromagnets. I achieve this with a discovery of a\nmany-body supersymmetry (SUSY) in the phonon problem of balls and springs and\nits connection to local constraints satisfied by ground states. The Witten\nindex of the SUSY model demands the Maxwell-Calladine index of mechanical\nstructures. \"Spontaneous supersymmetry breaking\" is identified as the need to\ngap all modes in the bulk to create the topological isostatic lattice state.\nSince ground states of magnetic systems also satisfy local constraint\nconditions (such as the vanishing of the total spin on a triangle) I identify a\nsimilar SUSY structure for many common models of antiferromagnets including the\nsquare, triangluar, kagome, pyrochlore nearest neighbor antiferromagnets, and\nthe $J_2 = J_1/2$ square lattice antiferromagnet. Remarkably, the kagome family\nof antiferromagnets is the analog of topological isostatic lattices among this\ncollections of models. Thus, a solid state realization of the theory of phonon\ntopological band structure may be found in frustrated magnetic materials.\n", "  In a changing climate, a key role may be played by the response of\nconvective-type cloud and precipitation to temperature changes. Yet, it is\nunclear if precipitation intensities will increase mainly due to modified\nthermodynamic forcing or due to stronger convective dynamics. In gradual\nself-organization, convective events produce highest intensities late in the\nday. Tracking rain cells throughout their life cycles, we find that interacting\nevents respond strongly to changes in boundary conditions. Conversely, events\nwithout interaction remain unaffected. Increased surface temperature indeed\nleads to more interaction and higher precipitation extremes. However, a similar\nintensification occurs when leaving temperature unchanged but simply granting\nmore time for self-organization.Our study implies that the convective field as\na whole acquires a memory of past precipitation and inter-cloud dynamics,\ndriving extremes. Our results implicate that the dynamical interaction between\nconvective clouds must be incorporated in global climate models to describe\nconvective extremes and the diurnal cycle more realistically.\n", "  The two-dimensional minimal supersymmetric sigma models with homogeneous\ntarget spaces $G/H$ and chiral fermions of the same chirality are revisited. We\ndemonstrate that the Moore-Nelson consistency condition revealing a global\nanomaly in CP(N-1) (with N>2 and ${\\mathcal N}=(0,2)$ supersymmetry) due to a\nnontrivial first Pontryagin class is in one-to-one correspondence with the\nlocal anomalies of isometries in these models. These latter anomalies are\ngenerated by fermion loop diagrams which we explicitly calculate. In the case\nof O}(N) sigma models the first Pontryagin class vanishes, so there is no\nglobal obstruction for the minimal ${\\mathcal N}=(0,1)$ supersymmetrization of\nthese models. We show that at the local level isometries in these models are\nanomaly free. Thus, there are no obstructions to quantizing the minimal\n${\\mathcal N}=(0,1)$ models with the $S^{N-1}= SO(N)/SO(N-1)$ target space.\nThis also includes CP(1) (equivalent to $S^{2}$) which is an exceptional case\nfrom the CP(N-1) series. We also discuss a relation between the geometric and\ngauged formulations of the CP}(N-1) models.\n", "  In this work we explore the possibility that the motion of the deuterium ions\nemitted from Coulomb cluster explosions is chaotic enough to resemble\nthermalization. We analyze the process of nuclear fusion reactions driven by\nlaser-cluster interactions in experiments conducted at the Texas Petawatt laser\nfacility using a mixture of D2+3He and CD4+3He cluster targets. When clusters\nexplode by Coulomb repulsion, the emission of the energetic ions is nearly\nisotropic. In the framework of cluster Coulomb explosions, we analyze the\nenergy distributions of the ions using a Maxwell- Boltzmann (MB) distribution,\na shifted MB distribution (sMB) and the energy distribution derived from a\nlog-normal (LN) size distribution of clusters. We show that the first two\ndistributions reproduce well the experimentally measured ion energy\ndistributions and the number of fusions from d-d and d-3He reactions. The LN\ndistribution is a good representation of the ion kinetic energy distribution\nwell up to high momenta where the noise becomes dominant, but overestimates\nboth the neutron and the proton yields. If the parameters of the LN\ndistributions are chosen to reproduce the fusion yields correctly, the\nexperimentally measured high energy ion spectrum is not well represented. We\nconclude that the ion kinetic energy distribution is highly chaotic and\npractically not distinguishable from a thermalized one.\n", "  We present the construction of Maxwell's equal area law for the Guass-Bonnet\nAdS black holes in $d=5,6$ and third order Lovelock AdS black holes in $d=7,8$.\nThe equal area law can be used to find the number and location of the points of\nintersection in the plots of Gibbs free energy, so that we can get the\nthermodynamically preferred solution which corresponds to the first order phase\ntransition. We obtain the radius of the small and large black holes in the\nphase transition which share the same Gibbs free energy. The case with two\ncritical points is explored in much more details. The latent heat is also\nstudied.\n", "  Randomness extractors, widely used in classical and quantum cryptography and\nother fields of computer science, e.g., derandomization, are functions which\ngenerate almost uniform randomness from weak sources of randomness. In the\nquantum setting one must take into account the quantum side information held by\nan adversary which might be used to break the security of the extractor. In the\ncase of seeded extractors the presence of quantum side information has been\nextensively studied. For multi-source extractors one can easily see that high\nconditional min-entropy is not sufficient to guarantee security against\narbitrary side information, even in the classical case. Hence, the interesting\nquestion is under which models of (both quantum and classical) side information\nmulti-source extractors remain secure. In this work we suggest a natural model\nof side information, which we call the Markov model, and prove that any\nmulti-source extractor remains secure in the presence of quantum side\ninformation of this type (albeit with weaker parameters). This improves on\nprevious results in which more restricted models were considered and the\nsecurity of only some types of extractors was shown.\n", "  We exhibit a one-parameter group of automorphism on the Cuntz-algebra O_2\nsuch that the simplex of KMS states changes abruptly at a certain critical\ntemperature from infinitely many to one, and then none. The factor types of the\nextremal KMS states are also determined.\n", "  We present the results of multi-objective genetic algorithm optimizations of\na potential single shot ultra fast electron diffraction beamline utilizing a\n225 kV dc gun with a novel cryocooled photocathode system and buncher cavity.\nOptimizations of the transverse projected emittance as a function of bunch\ncharge are presented and discussed in terms of the scaling laws derived in the\ncharge saturation limit. Additionally, optimization of the transverse coherence\nlength as a function of final rms bunch length at sample location have been\nperformed for three different sample radii: 50, 100, 200 microns, for two final\nbunch charges: 100k and 1000k electrons. Analysis of the solutions is\ndiscussed, as are the effects of disorder induced heating. In particular, a\ncoherence length per rms spot size of 0.27 nm/micron was obtained for a final\nbunch charge of 100k electrons and final rms bunch length of approximately 100\nfs. For a final charge of 1000k electrons the cryogun produces a coherence\nlength per rms spot size of 0.1 nm/micron for an rms bunch length of 100-200 fs\nand final spot size of 50 micron. These results demonstrate the viability of\nusing genetic algorithms in the design and operation of ultrafast electron\ndiffraction beamlines.\n", "  The $O(\\alpha)$ electromagnetic radiative corrections to the $B^- \\rightarrow\nV^0 \\ell^- \\bar{\\nu}_{\\ell}$ ($V$ is a vector meson and $\\ell$ a charged\nlepton) decay rates are evaluated using the cutoff method to regularize virtual\ncorrections and incorporating intermediate resonance states in the real-photon\namplitude to extend the region of validity of the soft-photon approximation.\nThe electromagnetic and weak form factors of hadrons are assumed to vary\nsmoothly over the energies of virtual and real photons under consideration. The\ncutoff dependence of radiative corrections upon the scale $\\Lambda$ that\nseparates the long- and short-distance regimes is found to be mild and is\nconsidered as an uncertainty of the calculation. Owing to partial cancellations\nof electromagnetic corrections evaluated over the three- and four-body regions\nof phase space, the photon-inclusive corrected rates are found to be dominated\nby the short-distance contribution. These corrections will be relevant for a\nprecise determination of the $b$ quark mixing angles by testing isospin\nsymmetry when measurements of semileptonic rates of charged and neutral $B$\nmesons at the few percent level become available. For completeness, we also\nprovide numerical values of radiative corrections in the three-body region of\nthe Dalitz plot distributions of these decays.\n", "  We study the phase diagram of a topological string-net type lattice model in\nthe presence of geometrically frustrated interactions. These interactions drive\nseveral phase transitions that reduce the topological order, leading to a rich\nphase diagram including both Abelian ($\\mathbb{Z}_2$) and non-Abelian\n($\\text{Ising}\\times \\overline{\\text{Ising}}$) topologically ordered phases, as\nwell as phases with broken translational symmetry. Interestingly, one of these\nphases simultaneously exhibits (Abelian) topological order and long-ranged\norder due to translational symmetry breaking, with non-trivial interactions\nbetween excitations in the topological order and defects in the long-ranged\norder. We introduce a variety of effective models, valid along certain lines in\nthe phase diagram, which can be used to characterize both topological and\nsymmetry-breaking order in these phases, and in many cases allow us to\ncharacterize the phase transitions that separate them. We use exact\ndiagonalization and high-order series expansion to study areas of the phase\ndiagram where these models break down, and to approximate the location of the\nphase boundaries.\n", "  In sensory neurons the presence of noise can facilitate the detection of weak\ninformation-carrying signals, which are encoded and transmitted via correlated\nsequences of spikes. Here we investigate relative temporal order in spike\nsequences induced by a subthreshold periodic input, in the presence of white\nGaussian noise. To simulate the spikes, we use the FitzHugh-Nagumo model, and\nto investigate the output sequence of inter-spike intervals (ISIs), we use the\nsymbolic method of ordinal analysis. We find different types of relative\ntemporal order, in the form of preferred ordinal patterns which depend on both,\nthe strength of the noise and the period of the input signal. We also\ndemonstrate a resonance-like behavior, as certain periods and noise levels\nenhance temporal ordering in the ISI sequence, maximizing the probability of\nthe preferred patterns. Our findings could be relevant for understanding the\nmechanisms underlying temporal coding, by which single sensory neurons\nrepresent in spike sequences the information about weak periodic stimuli.\n", "  Calculating the quasiparticle (QP) band structure of two-dimensional (2D)\nmaterials within the GW self-energy approximation has proven to be a rather\ndemanding computational task. The main reason is the strong\n$\\mathbf{q}$-dependence of the 2D dielectric function around $\\mathbf{q} =\n\\mathbf{0}$ that calls for a much denser sampling of the Brillouin zone than is\nnecessary for similar 3D solids. Here we use an analytical expression for the\nsmall $\\mathbf{q}$-limit of the 2D response function to perform the BZ integral\nover the critical region around $\\mathbf{q} = \\mathbf{0}$. This drastically\nreduces the requirements on the $\\mathbf{q}$-point mesh and implies a\nsignificant computational speed-up. For example, in the case of monolayer\nMoS$_2$, convergence of the $G_0W_0$ band gap to within $\\sim 0.1\\,\\mathrm{eV}$\nis achieved with $12\\times 12$ $\\mathbf{q}$-points rather than the $36\\times\n36$ mesh required with discrete BZ sampling techniques. We perform a critical\nassessment of the band gap of the three prototypical 2D semiconductors MoS$_2$,\nhBN, and phosphorene including the effect of self-consistency at the GW$_0$ and\nGW level. The method is implemented in the open source GPAW code.\n", "  The properties of interacting bosons in a weak, one-dimensional, and\nbichromatic optical with a rational ratio of the constituting wavelengths\n$\\lambda_1$ and $\\lambda_2$ are numerically examined along a broad range of the\nLieb-Liniger interaction parameter $\\gamma$ passing through the Sine-Gordon\ntransition. It is argued that there should not be much difference in the\nresults between those due to an irrational ratio $\\lambda_1/\\lambda_2$ and due\nto a rational approximation of the latter. For a weak bichromatic optical\nlattice, it is chiefly demonstrated that this transition is robust against the\nintroduction of quasidisorder via a weaker, secondary, and incommensurate\noptical lattice superimposed on the primary one. The properties, such as the\ncorrelation function, Matsubara Green's function, and the single-particle\ndensity matrix, do not respond to changes in the depth of the secondary optical\nlattice $V_1$. For a stronger bichromatic optical lattice, however, a response\nis observed because of changes in $V_1$. It is found accordingly, that holes in\nthe SG regime play an important role in the response of properties to changes\nin $\\gamma$. The continuous-space worm algorithm Monte Carlo method [Boninsegni\n\\ea, Phys. Rev. E $\\mathbf{74}$, 036701 (2006)] is applied for the present\nexamination. It is found that the worm algorithm is able to reproduce the\nSine-Gordon transition that has been observed experimentally [Haller \\ea,\nNature $\\mathbf{466}$, 597 (2010)].\n", "  One of the principal mechanisms by which surfaces and interfaces affect\nmicrobial life is by perturbing the hydrodynamic flows generated by swimming.\nBy summing a recursive series of image systems we derive a numerically\ntractable approximation to the three-dimensional flow fields of a Stokeslet\n(point force) within a viscous film between a parallel no-slip surface and\nno-shear interface and, from this Green's function, we compute the flows\nproduced by a force- and torque-free micro-swimmer. We also extend the exact\nsolution of Liron & Mochon (1976) to the film geometry, which demonstrates that\nthe image series gives a satisfactory approximation to the swimmer flow fields\nif the film is sufficiently thick compared to the swimmer size, and we derive\nthe swimmer flows in the thin-film limit. Concentrating on the thick film case,\nwe find that the dipole moment induces a bias towards swimmer accumulation at\nthe no-slip wall rather than the water-air interface, but that higher-order\nmultipole moments can oppose this. Based on the analytic predictions we propose\nan experimental method to find the multipole coefficient that induces circular\nswimming trajectories, allowing one to analytically determine the swimmer's\nthree-dimensional position under a microscope.\n", "  The PLANCK collaboration has determined values for the spectral parameters of\nthe CMB radiation, namely the spectral index $n_s$, its running $\\alpha_s$, the\nrunning of the running $\\beta_s$, using a growing body of measurements of CMB\nanisotropies by the Planck satellite and other missions. These values do not\nfollow the hierarchy of sizes predicted by single field, slow roll inflationary\ntheory, and are thus difficult to fit for such inflation models.\n  In this work we present first a study of 49 single field, slow roll\ninflationary potentials in which we assess the likelyhood of these models\nfitting the spectral parameters to their currently most accurate determination\ngiven by the PLANCK collaboration. We check numerically with a MATLAB program\nthe spectral parameters that each model can yield for a very broad,\ncomprehensive list of possible parameter and field values. The comparison of\nspectral parameter values supported by the models with their determinations by\nthe PLANCK collaboration leads to the conclusion that the data provided by\nPLANCK2015 TT+lowP and PLANCK2015 TT,TE,EE+lowP taking into account the running\nof the running disfavours 40 of the 49 models with confidence level at least\n92.8\\%.\n  Next, we discuss the reliability of the current computations of these\nspectral parameters. We identify a bias in the method of determination of the\nspectral parameters by least residue parameter fitting (using MCMC or any other\nscheme) currently used to reconstruct the power spectrum of scalar\nperturbations. This bias can explain the observed contradiction between theory\nand observations. Its removal is computationally costly, but necessary in order\nto compare the forecasts of single field, slow roll theories with observations.\n", "  The conventional seesaw-leptogenesis can simultaneously explain the\nsuppression of neutrino masses and the generation of cosmic baryon asymmetry,\nbut usually cannot predict an unambiguous relation between these two sectors.\nIn this work we shall demonstrate a novel left-right symmetric scenario,\nmotivated to solve the strong CP problem by parity symmetry, where the present\nbaryon asymmetry is determined by three charged lepton masses and a\nseesaw-suppressed hermitian Dirac neutrino mass matrix up to an overall scale\nfactor. To produce the observed baryon asymmetry, this scenario requires that\nthe neutrinos must have a normal hierarchical mass spectrum and their mixing\nmatrix must contain a sizable Dirac CP phase. Our model can be tested in\nneutrino oscillation and neutrinoless double beta decay experiments.\n", "  Measurements of normalized differential cross-sections of top-quark pair\nproduction are presented as a function of the top-quark, $t\\bar{t}$ system and\nevent-level kinematic observables in proton-proton collisions at a\ncentre-of-mass energy of $\\sqrt{s}=8$ TeV}. The observables have been chosen to\nemphasize the $t\\bar{t}$ production process and to be sensitive to effects of\ninitial- and final-state radiation, to the different parton distribution\nfunctions, and to non-resonant processes and higher-order corrections. The\ndataset corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 20.3 fb$^{-1}$, recorded in\n2012 with the ATLAS detector at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. Events are\nselected in the lepton+jets channel, requiring exactly one charged lepton and\nat least four jets with at least two of the jets tagged as originating from a\n$b$-quark. The measured spectra are corrected for detector effects and are\ncompared to several Monte Carlo simulations. The results are in fair agreement\nwith the predictions over a wide kinematic range. Nevertheless, most generators\npredict a harder top-quark transverse momentum distribution at high values than\nwhat is observed in the data. Predictions beyond NLO accuracy improve the\nagreement with data at high top-quark transverse momenta. Using the current\nsettings and parton distribution functions, the rapidity distributions are not\nwell modelled by any generator under consideration. However, the level of\nagreement is improved when more recent sets of parton distribution functions\nare used.\n", "  We derive several uncertainty relations for two arbitrary unitary operators\nacting on physical states of a Hilbert space. We show that our bounds are\ntighter in various cases than the ones existing in the current literature.\nUsing the uncertainty relation for the unitary operators, we obtain the tight\nstate-independent lower bound for the uncertainty of two Pauli observables and\nanticommuting observables in higher dimensions. With regard to the\nminimum-uncertainty states, we derive the minimum-uncertainty state equation by\nthe analytic method and relate this to the ground-state problem of the Harper\nHamiltonian. Furthermore, the higher-dimensional limit of the uncertainty\nrelations and minimum-uncertainty states are explored. From an operational\npoint of view, we show that the uncertainty in the unitary operator is directly\nrelated to the visibility of quantum interference in an interferometer where\none arm of the interferometer is affected by a unitary operator. This shows a\nprinciple of preparation uncertainty, i.e., for any quantum system, the amount\nof visibility for two general noncommuting unitary operators is nontrivially\nupper bounded.\n", "  The discovery of the Higgs boson at the LHC exposes some of the most profound\nmysteries fundamental physics has encountered in decades, opening the door to\nthe next phase of experimental exploration. More than ever, this will\nnecessitate new machines to push us deeper into the energy frontier. In this\narticle, we discuss the physics motivation and present the physics potential of\na proton-proton collider running at an energy significantly beyond that of the\nLHC and a luminosity comparable to that of the LHC. 100 TeV is used as a\nbenchmark of the center of mass energy, with integrated luminosities from 3\ninverse ab to 30 inverse ab.\n", "  Dark matter may be coupled to dark radiation: light degrees of freedom that\nmediate forces between dark sector particles. Cosmological constraints favor\ndark radiation that is colder than Standard Model radiation. In models with\nfixed couplings between dark matter and the Standard Model, these constraints\ncan be difficult to satisfy if thermal equilibrium is assumed in the early\nuniverse. We construct a model of asymmetric reheating of the visible and dark\nsectors from late decays of a long-lived particle (for instance, a modulus). We\nshow, as a proof-of-principle, that such a model can populate a sufficiently\ncold dark sector while also generating baryon and dark matter asymmetries\nthrough the out of equilibrium decay. We frame much of our discussion in terms\nof the scenario of dissipative dark matter, as in the Double-Disk Dark Matter\nscenario. However, our results may also be of interest for other scenarios like\nthe Twin Higgs model that are in danger of overproducing dark radiation due to\nnonnegligible dark-visible couplings.\n", "  We discuss the consequences of possible sign changes of the $Q$-function\nwhich measures the energy transference between dark energy and dark matter. We\ninvestigate this scenario from a holographic perspective to modeling the dark\nenergy by a linear-parametrization of the equation of state parameter denoted\nby $\\omega$. By imposing the strong constraint of the second law of\nthermodynamics, we show that sign changes of $Q$ due to the cosmic evolution\nimply changes in the temperatures of dark energy and dark matter, respectively.\nWe also discuss the phase transitions, in the past and future, experienced by\ndark energy and dark matter (or, equivalently, the sign changes of their heat\ncapacities).\n", "  We introduce an $n$-species totally asymmetric zero range process ($n$-TAZRP)\non one-dimensional periodic lattice with $L$ sites. It is a continuous time\nMarkov process in which $n$ species of particles hop to the adjacent site only\nin one direction under the condition that smaller species ones have the\npriority to do so. Also introduced is an $n$-line process, a companion\nstochastic system having the uniform steady state from which the $n$-TAZRP is\nderived as the image by a certain projection $\\pi$. We construct the $\\pi$ by a\ncombinatorial $R$ of the quantum affine algebra $U_q(\\hat{sl}_L)$ and establish\na matrix product formula of the steady state probability of the $n$-TAZRP in\nterms of corner transfer matrices of a $q=0$-oscillator valued vertex model.\nThese results parallel the recent reformulation of the $n$-species totally\nasymmetric simple exclusion process ($n$-TASEP) by the authors, demonstrating\nthat $n$-TAZRP and $n$-TASEP are the canonical sister models associated with\nthe symmetric and the antisymmetric tensor representations of $U_q(\\hat{sl}_L)$\nat $q=0$, respectively.\n", "  We improve Knabe's spectral gap bound for frustration-free\ntranslation-invariant local Hamiltonians in 1D. The bound is based on a\nrelationship between global and local gaps. The global gap is the spectral gap\nof a size-$m$ chain with periodic boundary conditions, while the local gap is\nthat of a subchain of size $n<m$ with open boundary conditions. Knabe proved\nthat if the local gap is larger than the threshold value $1/(n-1)$ for some\n$n>2$, then the global gap is lower bounded by a positive constant in the\nthermodynamic limit $m\\rightarrow \\infty$. Here we improve the threshold to\n$\\frac{6}{n(n+1)}$, which is better (smaller) for all $n>3$ and which is\nasymptotically optimal. As a corollary we establish a surprising fact about 1D\ntranslation-invariant frustration-free systems that are gapless in the\nthermodynamic limit: for any such system the spectral gap of a size-$n$ chain\nwith open boundary conditions is upper bounded as $O(n^{-2})$. This contrasts\nwith gapless frustrated systems where the gap can be $\\Theta(n^{-1})$. It also\nlimits the extent to which the area law is violated in these frustration-free\nsystems, since it implies that the half-chain entanglement entropy is\n$O(1/\\sqrt{\\epsilon})$ as a function of spectral gap $\\epsilon$. We extend our\nresults to frustration-free systems on a 2D square lattice.\n", "  Since the W and Z discovery, hadron colliders have provided a fertile ground,\nin which continuously improving measurements and theoretical predictions allow\nto precisely determine the gauge boson properties, and to probe the dynamics of\nelectroweak and strong interactions. This article will review, from a\ntheoretical perspective, the role played by the study, at hadron colliders, of\nelectroweak boson production properties, from the better understanding of the\nproton structure, to the discovery and studies of the top quark and of the\nHiggs, to the searches for new phenomena beyond the Standard Model.\n", "  In first-passage percolation, we place i.i.d. continuous weights at the edges\nof Z^2 and consider the weighted graph metric. A distance-minimizing path\nbetween points x and y is called a geodesic, and a bigeodesic is a\ndoubly-infinite path whose segments are geodesics. It is a famous conjecture\nthat almost surely, there are no bigeodesics. In the '90s, Licea-Newman showed\nthat, under a curvature assumption on the \"asymptotic shape\", all infinite\ngeodesics have an asymptotic direction, and there is a full-measure set D of\n[0, 2 pi) such that for any theta in D, there are no bigeodesics with one end\ndirected in direction theta. In this paper, we show that there are no\nbigeodesics with one end directed in any deterministic direction, assuming the\nshape boundary is differentiable. This rules out existence of ground state\npairs for the related disordered ferromagnet whose interface has a\ndeterministic direction. Furthermore, it resolves the Benjamini-Kalai-Schramm\n\"midpoint problem\" under the extra assumption that the limit shape boundary is\ndifferentiable.\n", "  We investigate the non-classical states of light that emerge in a microwave\nresonator coupled to a periodically-driven electron in a nanowire double\nquantum dot (DQD). Under certain drive configurations, we find that the\nresonator approaches a thermal state at the temperature of the surrounding\nsubstrate with a chemical potential given by a harmonic of the drive frequency.\nAway from these thermal regions we find regions of gain and loss, where the\nsystem can lase, or regions where the DQD acts as a single-photon source. These\neffects are observable in current devices and have broad utility for quantum\noptics with microwave photons.\n", "  Association rules mining is one of the most important problems in knowledge\ndiscovery and data mining. The goal of it is to acquire consumption habits of\ncustomers by discovering the relationships between items from a transaction\ndatabase that has a large number of transactions and items. The most compute\nintensive process for ARM is to find out the frequent 1-itemsets and\n2-itemsets. In this paper, we propose a quantum algorithm for finding out the\nfrequent 1-itemsets and 2-itemsets. In our algorithm, to mine the frequent\n1-itemsets efficiently, we use the technique of amplitude amplification. To\nmine the frequent 2-itemsets efficiently, we propose a new tomography scheme,\ni.e., pure-state-based quantum state tomography. It is shown that our algorithm\nis potential to achieve exponential speedup in the number of transactions and\npolynomial speedup in the number of items over the classical algorithm.\n", "  In the first order of the fine structer constant, the polarization operator\nof a photon is investigated in a constant and homogeneous magnetic field at\narbitrary photon energies. For weak and strong fields H, compared with the\nSchwinger critical field, approximate expressions have been found. We consider\nthe pure quantum region of photon energy near the threshold of pair creation,\nas well as the region of high energy levels where the quasiclassical\napproximation is valid. The general formula has been obtained for the effective\nmass of photon with given polarization. It is useful for an analysis of the\nproblem under consideration on the whole and at a numerical work\n", "  The assumption of anarchic quark flavor puts serious stress on composite\nHiggs models: flavor bounds imply a tuning of a few per-mille (at best) in the\nHiggs potential. Composite twin Higgs (CTH) models significantly reduce this\ntension by opening up a new region of parameter space, obtained by raising the\ncoupling among the composites close to the strong coupling limit $g_* \\sim\n4\\pi$, thereby raising the scale of composites to around 10 TeV. This does not\nlead to large tuning in the Higgs potential since the leading quantum\ncorrections are canceled by the twin partners (rather than the composites). We\nsurvey the leading flavor bounds on the CTH, which correspond to tree-level\n$\\Delta F=2$ four-Fermi operators from Kaluza-Klein (KK) Z exchange in the kaon\nsystem and 1-loop corrections from KK fermions to the electric dipole moment of\nthe neutron. We provide a parametric estimate for these bounds and also perform\na numeric scan of the parameter space using the complete calculation for both\nquantities. The results confirm our expectation that CTH models accommodate\nanarchic flavor significantly better than regular composite Higgs (CH) models.\nOur conclusions apply both to the identical and fraternal twin cases.\n", "  We study the escape rate for the Farey map, an infinite measure preserving\nsystem, with a hole including the indifferent fixed point. Due to the ergodic\nproperties of the map, the standard theoretical approaches to this problem\ncannot be applied. To overcome this difficulties we propose here to consider\napproximations of the hole by means of real analytic functions. We introduce a\nparticular family of approximations and study numerically the behavior of the\nescape rate for \"shrinking\" approximated holes. The results suggest that the\nscaling of the escape rate depends on the chosen approximation, but \"converges\"\nto the behavior found for piecewise linear approximations of the map in\n\\cite{KM}.\n", "  We describe the Lie group and the group representations associated to the\nnonlinear Thermodynamic Coordinate Transformations (TCT). The TCT guarantee the\nvalidity of the Thermodynamic Covariance Principle (TCP) : {\\it The nonlinear\nclosure equations, i.e. the flux-force relations, everywhere and in particular\noutside the Onsager region, must be covariant under TCT}. In other terms, the\nfundamental laws of thermodynamics should be manifestly covariant under\ntransformations between the admissible thermodynamic forces, i.e. under TCT.\nThe TCP ensures the validity of the fundamental theorems for systems far from\nequilibrium. The symmetry properties of a physical system are intimately\nrelated to the conservation laws characterizing that system. Noether's theorem\ngives a precise description of this relation. We derive the conserved\n(thermodynamic) currents and, as an example of calculation, a simple system out\nof equilibrium where the validity of TCP is imposed at the level of the kinetic\nequations is also analyzed.\n", "  We study the action of mirror symmetry on two-dimensional N=(2,2) effective\ntheories obtained by compactifying Type IIA string theory on Calabi-Yau\nfourfolds. Our focus is on fourfold geometries with non-trivial three-form\ncohomology. The couplings of the massless zero-modes arising by expanding in\nthese forms depend both on the complex structure deformations and the Kahler\nstructure deformations of the Calabi-Yau fourfold. We argue that two\nholomorphic functions of the deformation moduli capture this information. These\nare exchanged under mirror symmetry, which allows us to derive them at the\nlarge complex structure and large volume point. We discuss the application of\nthe resulting explicit expression to F-theory compactifications and their weak\nstring coupling limit. In the latter orientifold settings we demonstrate\ncompatibility with mirror symmetry of Calabi-Yau threefolds at large complex\nstructure. As a byproduct we find an interesting relation of no-scale like\nconditions on Kahler potentials to the existence of chiral and twisted-chiral\ndescriptions in two dimensions.\n", "  The residence time of cosmic rays (CRs) in the Galaxy is usually inferred\nfrom the measurement of the ratio of secondary-to-primary nuclei, such as the\nboron (B)/carbon (C) ratio, which provides an estimate of the amount of matter\ntraversed by CRs during their propagation, the so called CR grammage. However,\nafter being released by their parent sources, for instance supernova remnants\n(SNRs), CRs must cross the disc of the Galaxy, before entering the much lower\ndensity halo, in which they are believed to spend most of the time before\neventually escaping the Galaxy. In the near-source region, the CR propagation\nis shown to be dominated by the non-linear self-generation of waves. Here we\nshow that due to this effect, the time that CRs with energies up to $\\sim$ 10\nTeV spend within a distance $L_{c}\\sim 100$ pc from the sources is much larger\nthan naive estimates would suggest. The corresponding grammage is close to\ncurrent estimates of the total grammage traversed throughout the whole Galaxy.\nMoreover, there is an irreducible grammage that CRs traverse while trapped\ndownstream of the shock that accelerated them, though this contribution is\nrather uncertain. We conclude that at energies $\\lesssim 1$ TeV, the observed\ngrammage is heavily affected by the near-source non-linear trapping of CRs, and\nat energies $\\gtrsim 1$ TeV it is affected by the source grammage. As a result,\nthe measurement of the B/C ratio should be used very cautiously as an indicator\nof the propagation of CRs on large Galactic scales.\n", "  We demonstrate that the quantum corrections to the classical arrival time for\na quantum object in a potential free region of space, as computed by Galapon\n[Phys. Rev. A {\\bf 80}, 030102(R) (2009)], can be eliminated up to a given\norder of $\\hbar$ by choosing an appropriate position-dependent phase for the\nobject's wavefunction. This then implies that we can make the quantum arrival\ntime of the object as close as possible to its corresponding classical arrival\ntime, allowing us to synchronize a classical and quantum clock which tells time\nusing the classical and quantum arrival time of the object, respectively. We\nprovide an example for synchronizing such a clock by making use of a quantum\nobject with a position-dependent phase imprinted on the object's initial\nwavefunction with the use of an impulsive potential.\n", "  We study the generalization of the dispersionless Kadomtsev - Petviashvili\n(dKP) equation in n+1 dimensions and with nonlinearity of degree m+1, a model\nequation describing the propagation of weakly nonlinear, quasi one dimensional\nwaves in the absence of dispersion and dissipation, and arising in several\nphysical contexts, like acoustics, plasma physics, hydrodynamics and nonlinear\noptics. In 2+1 dimensions and with quadratic nonlinearity, this equation is\nintegrable through a novel IST, and it has been recently shown to be a\nprototype model equation in the description of the two dimensional wave\nbreaking of localized initial data. In higher dimensions and with higher\nnonlinearity, the generalized dKP equations are not integrable, but their\ninvariance under motions on the paraboloid allows one to construct in this\npaper a family of exact solutions describing waves constant on their\nparaboloidal wave front and breaking simultaneously in all points of it,\ndeveloping after breaking either multivaluedness or single valued discontinuous\nshocks. Then such exact solutions are used to build the longtime behavior of\nthe solutions of the Cauchy problem, for small and localized initial data,\nshowing that wave breaking of small initial data takes place in the longtime\nregime if and only if $m(n-1)\\le 2$. At last, the analytic aspects of such a\nwave breaking are investigated in detail in terms of the small initial data, in\nboth cases in which the solution becomes multivalued after breaking or it\ndevelops a discontinuous shock. These results, contained in the 2012 master\nthesis of one of the authors (FS), generalize those obtained by one of the\nauthors (PMS) and S.V.Manakov for the dKP equation in n+1 dimensions with\nquadratic nonlinearity, and are obtained following the same strategy.\n", "  We study the splitting in the screening mass of pions and the $\\eta$-meson\nacross the chiral crossover. This splitting is determined by the 't Hooft\ndeterminant. We use results for the renormalisation group scale dependence of\nthe 't Hooft determinant obtained within the functional renomalisation group in\nquenched QCD with two flavours. The scale dependence of the 't Hooft\ndeterminant is mapped to its temperature dependence with the help of a\nPolyakov-quark-meson model. As a result we obtain the temperature dependence of\nthe splitting in the screening mass of pions and the $\\eta$-meson.\n", "  We enumerate the conditions necessary for $CP$ violation to be manifest in\n$n$-$\\bar n$ oscillations, and build a simple model that can give rise to such\neffects. We discuss a possible connection between neutron oscillations and dark\nmatter, provided the mass of the latter lies between $m_p-m_e$ and $m_p+m_e$.\nWe apply our results to a possible baryogenesis scenario involving $CP$\nviolation in the oscillations of the $\\Xi^0$.\n", "  [Abridged] Enormous observational efforts have been made to constrain the\nenergetics of AGN feedback by mapping the kinematics of the ionized gas on kpc\nscale. We study how the observed kinematics and inferred energetics are\naffected by beam smearing of a bright unresolved NLR due to seeing. We analyse\nIFU spectroscopy of a sample of twelve QSOs initially presented by Liu et al.\n(2014). The PSF for the observations is directly obtained from the light\ndistribution of the broad Hb line component. We are able to compare the ionized\ngas kinematics and derived energetics of the total, spatially extended, and\nunresolved [OIII] emission. We find that the spatially resolved [OIII] line\nwidth on kpc scales is significantly narrower than the one before PSF\ndeblending. The ENLRs appear offset from the QSO position or more elongated\nwhich can be interpreted in favour of a conical outflow on large scales while a\nspherical geometry cannot be excluded for the unresolved NLR. We find that the\nkinetic power at 5kpc distance from the spherical model by Liu et al. (2013) is\nreduced by two magnitudes for a conical outflow and one magnitude for the\nunresolved NLR after PSF deblending. This reduced kinetic power corresponds to\n0.01-0.1% of the bolometric AGN luminosity. This is smaller than the 5-10%\nfeedback efficiency required by some simulations to reproduce the massive\ngalaxy population. The injected momentum fluxes are close or below the simple\nradiation-pressure limit Lbol/c for the conical outflow model for the NLR and\nENLR when beam smearing is considered. IFU spectroscopy is a powerful tool to\ninvestigate the energetics of AGN outflows, but the impact of beam smearing has\nto be taken into account. For the majority of observations in the literature,\nthis has not been addressed carefully so that the incidence and energetics of\npresumed kpc-scale AGN-driven outflows still remain an unsolved issue.\n", "  In the context of a nonuniversal and anomaly free $U(1)_{X}$ extension of the\nstandard model, we examine the decay of a $750$GeV scalar singlet state,\n$\\xi_{\\chi}$, as a possible explanation of the observed diphoton excess\nannounced by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations at CERN-LHC collider. One-loop\ndecay to photons is allowed through three heavy singlet quarks and one charged\nHiggs boson into the loop. We obtain, for different width approximations and\nfor masses of the exotic singlet quarks in the region $[900,\\,3000]$ GeV, a\nproduction cross section $\\sigma(pp\\to\\xi_{\\chi}\\to\\gamma\\gamma)$ compatible\nwith ATLAS and CMS collaborations data. We also include another scalar singlet,\n$\\sigma$, as a dark matter candidate that may couple with the 750 GeV scalar at\ntree level with production cross sections in agreement with ATLAS and CMS.\n", "  We consider the central limit theorem for stable laws in the case of the\nstandardized sum of independent and identically distributed random variables\nwith regular probability density function. By showing decay of different\nentropy functionals along the sequence we prove convergence with explicit rate\nin various norms to a L\\'evy centered density of parameter $\\lambda >1$ . This\nintroduces a new information-theoretic approach to the central limit theorem\nfor stable laws, in which the main argument is shown to be the relative\nfractional Fisher information, recently introduced by the same author (cf.\narXiv 1504.07057). In particular, it is proven that, with respect to the\nrelative fractional Fisher information, the L\\'evy density satisfies an\nanalogous of the logarithmic Sobolev inequality, which allows to pass from the\nmonotonicity and decay to zero of the relative fractional Fisher information in\nthe standardized sum to the decay to zero in relative entropy with an explicit\ndecay rate.\n", "  We compute Vassiliev invariants up to order six for arbitrary pretzel knots,\nwhich depend on $g+1$ parameters $n_1,\\ldots,n_{g+1}$. These invariants are\nsymmetric polynomials in $n_1,\\ldots,n_{g+1}$ whose degree coincide with their\norder. We also discuss their topological and integer-valued properties.\n", "  The symmetries of string theory on ${\\rm AdS}_3 \\times {\\rm S}^3 \\times\n\\mathbb{T}^4$ at the dual of the symmetric product orbifold point are described\nby a so-called Higher Spin Square (HSS). We show that the massive string\nspectrum in this background organises itself in terms of representations of\nthis HSS, just as the matter in a conventional higher spin theory does so in\nterms of representations of the higher spin algebra. In particular, the entire\nuntwisted sector of the orbifold can be viewed as the Fock space built out of\nthe multiparticle states of a single representation of the HSS, the so-called\n`minimal' representation. The states in the twisted sector can be described in\nterms of tensor products of a novel family of representations that are somewhat\nlarger than the minimal one.\n", "  The spectral resolution of a dispersive astronomical spectrograph is limited\nby the trade-off between throughput and the width of the entrance slit.\nPhotonic guided-wave transitions have been proposed as a route to bypass this\ntrade-off, by enabling the efficient reformatting of incoherent seeing-limited\nlight collected by the telescope into a linear array of single modes: a\npseudo-slit which is highly multimode in one axis but diffraction-limited in\nthe dispersion axis of the spectrograph. It is anticipated that the size of a\nsingle-object spectrograph fed with light in this manner would be essentially\nindependent of the telescope aperture size. A further anticipated benefit is\nthat such spectrographs would be free of `modal noise', a phenomenon that\noccurs in high-resolution multimode fibre-fed spectrographs due to the coherent\nnature of the telescope point-spread-function (PSF). We address these aspects\nby integrating a multicore fibre photonic lantern with an ultrafast laser\ninscribed three-dimensional waveguide interconnect to spatially reformat the\nmodes within the PSF into a diffraction-limited pseudo-slit. Using the CANARY\nadaptive optics (AO) demonstrator on the William Herschel Telescope, and 1530\n$\\pm$ 80 nm stellar light, the device is found to exhibit a transmission of\n47-53 % depending upon the mode of AO correction applied. We also show the\nadvantage of using AO to couple light into such a device by sampling only the\ncore of the CANARY PSF. This result underscores the possibility that a\nfully-optimised guided-wave device can be used with AO to provide efficient\nspectroscopy at high spectral resolution.\n", "  We make a first principle calculation of the fragility index $m$ of a simple\nliquid using the structure of the supercooled liquid as an input. Using the\ndensity functional theory (DFT) of classical liquids, the configurational\nentropy ${\\cal S}_c$ is obtained for low degree of supercooling. We extrapolate\nthis data to estimate the Kauzmann temperature $T_\\mathrm{K}$ for the liquid.\nUsing the Adam-Gibbs relation, we link the configurational entropy ${\\cal S}_c$\nto the relaxation time. The relaxation times are obtained from direct solutions\nof the equations of fluctuating nonlinear hydrodynamics (FNH). These equations\nalso form the basis of the mode coupling theory (MCT) for glassy dynamics. The\nfragility index for the supercooled liquid is estimated from analysis of the\ncurves on the Angell plot.\n", "  We review some aspects of spin physics where QCD instantons play an important\nrole. In particular, their large contributions in semi-inclusive deep-inelastic\nscattering and polarized proton on proton scattering. We also review their\npossible contribution in the $\\mathcal{P}$-odd pion azimuthal charge\ncorrelations in peripheral $AA$ scattering at collider energies.\n", "  We investigate the quantisation in the Heisenberg representation of a\nrelativistically covariant version of the Hopfield model for dielectric media,\nwhich entails the interaction of the quantum electromagnetic field with the\nmatter dipole fields. The matter fields are represented by a mesoscopic\npolarization field. A full quantisation of the model is provided in a covariant\ngauge, with the aim of maintaining explicit relativistic covariance. Breaking\nof the Lorentz invariance due to the intrinsic presence in the model of a\npreferred reference frame is also taken into account. Relativistic covariance\nforces us to deal with the unphysical (scalar and longitudinal) components of\nthe fields, furthermore it introduces, in a more tricky form, the well-known\ndipole ghost of standard QED in a covariant gauge. In order to correctly\ndispose of this contribution, we implement a generalized Lautrup trick.\nFurthermore, causality and the relation of the model with the Wightman axioms\nare also discussed.\n", "  We consider a time-dependent deformation of anti-de-Sitter (AdS) space-time\nwhich contains a cosmological \"singularity\" - a space-like region of high\ncurvature. Making use of the AdS/CFT correspondence we can map the bulk\ndynamics onto the boundary. The boundary theory has a time dependent coupling\nconstant which becomes small at times when the bulk space-time is highly\ncurved. We investigate the propagation of small fluctuations of a test scalar\nfield from early times before the bulk singularity to late times after the\nsingularity. Under the assumption that the AdS/CFT correspondence extends to\ndeformed AdS space-times, we can map the bulk evolution of the scalar field\nonto the evolution of the boundary gauge field. The time evolution of\nlinearized fluctuations is well defined in the boundary theory as long as the\ncoupling remains finite, so that we can extend the boundary perturbations to\nlate times after the singularity. Assuming that the spacetime in the future of\nthe singularity has a weakly coupled region near the boundary, we reconstruct\nthe bulk fluctuations after the singularity crossing making use of generic\nproperties of boundary-to-bulk propagators. Finally, we extract the spectrum of\nthe fluctuations at late times given some initial spectrum. We find that the\nspectral index is unchanged, but the amplitude increases due to the squeezing\nof the fluctuations during the course of the evolution. This investigation can\nteach us important lessons on how the spectrum of cosmological perturbations\npasses through a bounce which is singular from the bulk point of view but which\nis resolved using an ultraviolet complete theory of quantum gravity.\n", "  This study investigated the extended Holstein--Hubbard model at half-filling\nas a model for describing interplay of the electron-electron and\nelectron-phonon couplings. When the electron-phonon and nearest-neighbor\nelectron-electron interactions are strong, we prove the existence of long-range\ncharge order at sufficiently low temperature in three or more dimensions. As a\nresult, we rigorously justify the phase competition between the\nantiferromagnetic and charge orders.\n", "  We show that, in the presence of a $\\pi/2$ artificial gauge field per\nplaquette, Mott insulating phases of ultra-cold fermions with $SU(N)$ symmetry\nand one particle per site generically possess an extended chiral phase with\nintrinsic topological order characterized by a multiplet of $N$ low-lying\nsinglet excitations for periodic boundary conditions, and by chiral edge states\ndescribed by the $SU(N)_1$ Wess-Zumino-Novikov-Witten conformal field theory\nfor open boundary conditions. This has been achieved by extensive exact\ndiagonalizations for $N$ between $3$ and $9$, and by a parton construction\nbased on a set of $N$ Gutzwiller projected fermionic wave-functions with flux\n$\\pi/N$ per triangular plaquette. Experimental implications are briefly\ndiscussed.\n", "  Ab initio density functional theory calculations are carried out to predict\nthe electronic properties and relative stability of gallium sulfide nanoribbons\n(Ga2S2-NRs) with either zigzag- or armchair-terminated edges. It is found that\nthe electronic properties of the nanoribbons are very sensitive to the edge\nstructure. The zigzag nanoribbons (Ga2S2-ZNRs) are metallic with spin-polarized\nedge states regardless of the H-passivation,whereas the bare armchair ones\n(Ga2S2-ANRs) are semiconducting with an indirect band gap. This band gap\nexhibits an oscillation behavior as the width increases and finally converges\nto a constant value. Similar behavior is also found in H-saturated Ga2S2-ANRs,\nalthough the band gap converges to a larger value. The relative stabilities of\nthe bare ANRs and ZNRs are investigated by calculating their binding energies.\nIt is found that for a similar width the ANRs are more stable than the ZNRs,\nand both are more stable than some Ga2S2 nanocluters with stable\nconfigurations.\n", "  We theoretically investigate the ground-state properties of a quantum dot\ndefined on the surface of a strong three-dimensional time-reversal invariant\ntopological insulator. Confinement is realized by ferromagnetic barriers and\nCoulomb interaction is treated numerically for up to seven electrons in the\ndot. Experimentally relevant intermediate interaction strengths are considered.\nThe topological nature of the dot has interesting consequences: i) spin\npolarization increases and the ground state exhibits quantum phase transitions\nat specific angular momenta as a function of interaction strength ii) the onset\nof Wigner correlations takes place mainly in one spin channel, iii) the ground\nstate is characterized by a persistent current which changes sign as a function\nof the radius of the dot.\n", "  On-shell helicity methods provide powerful tools for determining scattering\namplitudes, which have a one-to-one correspondence with leading power helicity\noperators in the Soft-Collinear Effective Theory (SCET) away from singular\nregions of phase space. We show that helicity based operators are also useful\nfor enumerating power suppressed SCET operators, which encode subleading\namplitude information about singular limits. In particular, we present a\ncomplete set of scalar helicity building blocks that are valid for constructing\noperators at any order in the SCET power expansion. We also describe an\ninteresting angular momentum selection rule that restricts how these building\nblocks can be assembled.\n", "  Transient detection and flux measurement via image subtraction stand at the\nbase of time domain astronomy. Due to the varying seeing conditions, the image\nsubtraction process is non-trivial, and existing solutions suffer from a\nvariety of problems. Starting from basic statistical principles, we develop the\noptimal statistic for transient detection, flux measurement and any\nimage-difference hypothesis testing. We derive a closed-form statistic that:\n(i) Is mathematically proven to be the optimal transient detection statistic in\nthe limit of background-dominated noise; (ii) Is numerically stable; (iii) For\naccurately registered, adequately sampled images, does not leave subtraction or\ndeconvolution artifacts; (iv) Allows automatic transient detection to the\ntheoretical sensitivity limit by providing credible detection significance; (v)\nHas uncorrelated white noise; (vi) Is a sufficient statistic for any further\nstatistical test on the difference image, and in particular, allows to\ndistinguish particle hits and other image artifacts from real transients; (vii)\nIs symmetric to the exchange of the new and reference images; (viii) Is at\nleast an order of magnitude faster to compute than some popular methods; and\n(ix) Is straightforward to implement. Furthermore, we present extensions of\nthis method that make it resilient to registration errors, color-refraction\nerrors, and any noise source that can be modelled. In addition, we show that\nthe optimal way to prepare a reference image is the proper image coaddition\npresented in Zackay \\& Ofek (2015b). We demonstrate this method on simulated\ndata and real observations from the Palomar Transient Factory data release 2.\nWe provide an implementation of this algorithm in MATLAB and Python.\n", "  A simple discontinuous map is proposed as a generic model for nonlinear\ndynamical systems. The orbit of the map admits exact solutions for wide regions\nin parameter space and the method employed (digit manipulation) allows the\nmathematical design of useful signals, such as regular or aperiodic\noscillations with specific waveforms, the construction of complex attractors\nwith nontrivial properties as well as the coexistence of different basins of\nattraction in phase space with different qualitative properties. A detailed\nanalysis of the dynamical behavior of the map suggests how the latter can be\nused in the modeling of complex nonlinear dynamics including, e.g., aperiodic\nnonchaotic attractors and the hierarchical deposition of grains of different\nsizes on a surface.\n", "  We propose a method to realize diluted magnetic semiconductors (DMS) with p-\nand n-type carriers by choosing host semiconductors with a narrow band gap. By\nemploying a combination of the density function theory and quantum Monte Carlo\nsimulation, we demonstrate such semiconductors using Mn-doped BaZn2As2, which\nhas a band gap of 0.2 eV. In addition, we found a new non-toxic DMS Mn-doped\nBaZn2Sb2, of which the Curie temperature Tc is predicted to be higher than that\nof Mn-doped BaZn2As2, the Tc of which was up to 230 K in the recent experiment.\n", "  We study the realization of slow-roll inflation in $\\mathcal N = 1$\nsupergravities where inflation is the result of the evolution of a single\nchiral field. When there is only one flat direction in field space, it is\npossible to derive a single-field effective field theory parametrized by the\nsound speed $c_s$ at which curvature perturbations propagate during inflation.\nThe value of $c_s$ is determined by the rate of bend of the inflationary path\nresulting from the shape of the $F$-term potential. We show that $c_s$ must\nrespect an inequality that involves the curvature tensor of the Kahler manifold\nunderlying supergravity, and the ratio $M/H$ between the mass $M$ of\nfluctuations ortogonal to the inflationary path, and the Hubble expansion rate\n$H$. This inequality provides a powerful link between observational constraints\non primordial non-Gaussianity and information about the $\\mathcal N = 1$\nsupergravity responsible for inflation. In particular, the inequality does not\nallow for suppressed values of $c_s$ (values smaller than $c_s \\sim 0.4$)\nunless (a) the ratio $M/H$ is of order 1 or smaller, and (b) the fluctuations\nof mass $M$ affect the propagation of curvature perturbations by inducing on\nthem a nonlinear dispersion relation during horizon crossing. Therefore, if\nlarge non-Gaussianity is observed, supergravity models of inflation would be\nseverely constrained.\n", "  Topological phases of matter are a potential platform for the storage and\nprocessing of quantum information with intrinsic error rates that decrease\nexponentially with inverse temperature and with the length scales of the\nsystem, such as the distance between quasiparticles. However, it is less\nwell-understood how error rates depend on the speed with which non-Abelian\nquasiparticles are braided. In general, diabatic corrections to the holonomy or\nBerry's matrix vanish at least inversely with the length of time for the braid,\nwith faster decay occurring as the time-dependence is made smoother. We show\nthat such corrections will not affect quantum information encoded in\ntopological degrees of freedom, unless they involve the creation of\ntopologically nontrivial quasiparticles. Moreover, we show how measurements\nthat detect unintentionally created quasiparticles can be used to control this\nsource of error.\n", "  The r-process nuclei are robustly synthesized in the material ejected during\na neutron star binary merger (NSBM), as tidal torques transport angular\nmomentum and energy through the outer Lagrange point in the form of a vast\ntidal tail. If NSBM are indeed solely responsible for the solar system r-\nprocess abundances, a galaxy like our own would require to host a few NSBM per\nmillion years, with each event ejecting, on average, about 5x10^{-2} M_sun of\nr-process material. Because the ejecta velocities in the tidal tail are\nsignificantly larger than in ordinary supernovae, NSBM deposit a comparable\namount of energy into the interstellar medium (ISM). In contrast to extensive\nefforts studying spherical models for supernova remnant evolution, calculations\nquantifying the impact of NSBM ejecta in the ISM have been lacking. To better\nunderstand their evolution in a cosmological context, we perform a suite of\nthree-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations with optically-thin radiative\ncooling of isolated NSBM ejecta expanding in environments with conditions\nadopted from Milky Way-like galaxy simulations. Although the remnant morphology\nis highly complex at early times, the subsequent radiative evolution that\nresults from thermal instability in atomic gas is remarkably similar to that of\na standard supernova blast wave. This implies that sub-resolution supernova\nfeedback models can be used in galaxy-scale simulations that are unable to\nresolve the key evolutionary phases of NSBM blast waves. Among other\nquantities, we examine the radius, time, mass and kinetic energy content of the\nNSBM remnant at shell formation as well as the momentum injected to the ISM. We\nfind that the shell formation epoch is attained when the swept-up mass is about\n10^3 M_sun, at this point the mass fraction of r-process material is\ndrastically enhanced up to two orders of magnitude in relation to a solar\nmetallicity ISM.\n", "  We present an evaluation of systematic effects associated with a\ncontinuously-rotating, ambient-temperature half-wave plate (HWP) based on two\nseasons of data from the Atacama B-Mode Search (ABS) experiment located in the\nAtacama Desert of Chile. The ABS experiment is a microwave telescope sensitive\nat 145 GHz. Here we present our in-field evaluation of celestial (CMB plus\ngalactic foreground) temperature-to-polarization leakage. We decompose the\nleakage into scalar, dipole, and quadrupole leakage terms. We report a scalar\nleakage of ~0.01%, consistent with model expectations and an order of magnitude\nsmaller than other CMB experiments have reported. No significant dipole or\nquadrupole terms are detected; we constrain each to be <0.07% (95% confidence),\nlimited by statistical uncertainty in our measurement. Dipole and quadrupole\nleakage at this level lead to systematic error on r<0.01 before any mitigation\ndue to scan cross-linking or boresight rotation. The measured scalar leakage\nand the theoretical level of dipole and quadrupole leakage produce systematic\nerror of r<0.001 for the ABS survey and focal-plane layout before any data\ncorrection such as so-called deprojection. This demonstrates that ABS achieves\nsignificant beam systematic error mitigation from its HWP and shows the promise\nof continuously-rotating HWPs for future experiments.\n", "  We show that cold Rydberg gases enable an efficient six-wave mixing process\nwhere terahertz or microwave fields are coherently converted into optical\nfields and vice versa. This process is made possible by the long lifetime of\nRydberg states, the strong coupling of millimeter waves to Rydberg transitions\nand by a quantum interference effect related to electromagnetically induced\ntransparency (EIT). Our frequency conversion scheme applies to a broad spectrum\nof millimeter waves due to the abundance of transitions within the Rydberg\nmanifold, and we discuss two possible implementations based on focussed\nterahertz beams and millimeter wave fields confined by a waveguide,\nrespectively. We analyse a realistic example for the interconversion of\nterahertz and optical fields in rubidium atoms and find that the conversion\nefficiency can in principle exceed 90\\%.\n", "  We apply large $N$ diagrammatic techniques for theories with double-trace\ninteractions to the leading corrections to $C_J$, the coefficient of a\nconserved current two-point function, and $C_T$, the coefficient of the\nstress-energy tensor two-point function. We study in detail two famous\nconformal field theories in continuous dimensions, the scalar $O(N)$ model and\nthe Gross-Neveu model. For the $O(N)$ model, where the answers for the leading\nlarge $N$ corrections to $C_J$ and $C_T$ were derived long ago using analytic\nbootstrap, we show that the diagrammatic approach reproduces them correctly. We\nalso carry out a new perturbative test of these results using the $O(N)$\nsymmetric cubic scalar theory in $6-\\epsilon$ dimensions. We go on to apply the\ndiagrammatic method to the Gross-Neveu model, finding explicit formulae for the\nleading corrections to $C_J$ and $C_T$ as a function of dimension. We check\nthese large $N$ results using regular perturbation theory for the Gross-Neveu\nmodel in $2+\\epsilon$ dimensions and the Gross-Neveu-Yukawa model in\n$4-\\epsilon$ dimensions. For small values of $N$, we use Pade approximants\nbased on the $4-\\epsilon$ and $2+\\epsilon$ expansions to estimate the values of\n$C_J$ and $C_T$ in $d=3$. For the $O(N)$ model our estimates are close to those\nfound using the conformal bootstrap. For the GN model, our estimates suggest\nthat, even when $N$ is small, $C_T$ differs by no more than $2\\%$ from that in\nthe theory of free fermions. We find that the inequality $C_T^{\\textrm{UV}} >\nC_T^{\\textrm{IR}}$ applies both to the GN and the scalar $O(N)$ models in\n$d=3$.\n", "  We investigate light massive string states that appear at brane\nintersections. They replicate the massless spectrum in a richer fashion and may\nbe parametrically lighter than standard Regge excitations. We identify the\nfirst few physical states and determine their BRST invariant vertex operators.\nIn the supersymmetric case we reconstruct the super-multiplet structure. We\nthen compute some simple interactions, such as the decay rate of a massive\nscalar or vector into two massless fermions. Finally we suggest an alternative\ninterpretation of the 750 GeV diphoton excess at LHC in terms of a light\nmassive string state, a replica of the Standard Model Higgs.\n", "  We report the discovery of the two hot-Jupiters K2-30b and K2-34b. The two\nplanets were detected transiting their main-sequence star with periods $\\sim$\n4.099 and $\\sim$ 2.996 days, in campaigns 4 and 5 of the extension of the\nKepler mission, K2. Subsequent ground-based radial velocity follow-up with\nSOPHIE, HARPS-N and CAFE, established the planetary nature of the transiting\nobjects. We analyzed the transit signal, radial velocity and spectral energy\ndistributions of the two systems to characterize their properties. Both planets\n(K2-30b and K2-34b) are bloated hot-Jupiters (1.25 $R_{\\rm Jup}$ and 1.33\n$R_{\\rm Jup}$) around relatively bright (V =13.5 and V=11.5), slow rotating\nmain-sequence (G8 and F9) stars. Thus, these systems are good candidates for\ndetecting the Rossiter-MacLaughlin effect to measure their obliquity and for\natmospheric studies.\n", "  We suggest indirect excitons in 2D semiconductor heterostructures as a\nplatform for realization of a bosonic analog of the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer\nsuperconductor. The quantum phase transition to a biexcitonic gapped state can\nbe controlled in situ by tuning the electric field applied to the structure in\nthe growth direction. The proposed playground should allow one to go to\nstrongly correlated and high-temperature regimes, unattainable with Feshbach\nresonant atomic gases.\n", "  Rapid heating of small buried regions by laser generated fast electrons may\nbe useful for applications such as XUV radiation sources or as drivers for\nshock experiments. In non-structured targets the heating profile possesses a\nglobal maximum near the front surface. This paper presents a new target design\nthat uses resistive guiding to concentrate the fast electron current density at\na finite depth inside the target. The choice of geometry uses principles of\nnon-imaging optics. A global temperature maximum at depths up to 50{\\mu}m into\nthe target is achieved. Although theoretical calculations suggest that small\nsource sizes should perform better than large ones, simulations show that a\nlarge angular spread at high intensities results in significant losses of the\nfast electrons to the sides. A systematic parameter scan suggests an optimal\nlaser intensity. A ratio of 1.6 is demonstrated between the maximum ion\ntemperature and the ion temperature at the front surface.\n", "  The ATLAS and CMS Collaborations of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) have\nreported an excess of events in diphoton channel with invariant mass of about\n750 GeV. With low energy supersymmetry breaking, we systematically consider the\nsgoldstino scalar $S$ as the new resonance, which is a linear combination of\nthe CP-even scalar $s$ and CP-odd pseudoscalar $a$. Because we show that $s$\nand $a$ can be degenerated or have large mass splitting, we consider two cases\nfor all the following three scenarios: (1) Single resonance. $s$ is the 750 GeV\nresonance decays to a pair of 1 GeV pseudoscalar $a$. With suitable decay\nlength, these two $a$ decay into collimated pair of photons which cannot be\ndistinguished at the LHC and may appear as diphotons instead of four photons.\n(2) Twin resonances. $m_{s}\\approx m_{a}$ with a mass difference of about 40\nGeV and both $s$ and $a$ decay into diphoton pairs. For productions, we\nconsider three scenarios: (I) vector boson fusion; (II) gluon gluon fusion;\n(III) $q{\\bar q}$ pair production. In all these scenarios with two kinds of\nresonances, we find the parameter space that satisfies the diphoton production\ncross section from 3 to 13 ${\\rm fb}$ and all the other experimental\nconstraints. And we address the decay width as well. In particular, in the\nthird scenario, we observe that the production cross section is small but the\ndecay width of $s$ or $a$ can be from 40 to 60 GeV.\n", "  The intrinsic difficulties in extracting the hadron resonances from reaction\ndata are illustrated by using several exactly soluble $\\pi\\pi$ scattering\nmodels. The finite-volume Hamiltonian method is applied to predict spectra\nusing two meson-exchange Hamiltonians of $\\pi N$ reactions. Within a\nthree-channel model with $\\pi N$, $\\pi\\Delta$ and $\\sigma N$ channels, we show\nthe advantage of the finite-volume Hamiltonian method over the approach using\nthe L\\\"uscher formula to test Lattice QCD calculations aimed at predicting\nnucleon resonances. We discuss the necessary steps for using the ANL-Osaka\neight-channel Hamiltonian to predict the spectra for testing the LQCD\ncalculations for determining the excited nucleon states up to invariant mass\n$W= 2 $ GeV.\n", "  We study the properties of 4d N=3 superconformal field theories whose rank is\none, i.e. those that reduce to a single vector multiplet on their moduli space\nof vacua. We find that the moduli space can only be of the form C^3/Z_k for\nk=1,2,3,4,6, and that the supersymmetry automatically enhances to N=4 for\nk=1,2. In addition, we determine the central charges a and c in terms of k, and\nconstruct the associated 2d chiral algebras, which turn out to be exotic N=2\nsupersymmetric W-algebras.\n", "  We use the SU(2) slave fermion approach to study a tetrahedral spin 1/2\nchain, which is a one-dimensional generalization of the two dimensional Kitaev\nhoneycomb model. Using the mean field theory, coupled with a gauge fixing\nprocedure to implement the single occupancy constraint, we obtain the phase\ndiagram of the model. We then show that it matches the exact results obtained\nearlier using the Majorana fermion representation. We also compute the\nspin-spin correlation in the gapless phase and show that it is a spin liquid.\nFinally, we map the one-dimensional model in terms of the slave fermions to the\nmodel of 1D p-wave superconducting model with complex parameters and show that\nthe parameters of our model fall in the topological trivial regime and hence\ndoes not have edge Majorana modes.\n", "  The first study is presented of CP violation with an amplitude analysis of\nthe Dalitz plot of $B^0 \\to D K^+ \\pi^-$ decays, with $D \\to K^+ \\pi^-$, $K^+\nK^-$ and $\\pi^+ \\pi^-$. The analysis is based on a data sample corresponding to\n$3.0\\,{\\rm fb}^{-1}$ of $pp$ collisions collected with the LHCb detector. No\nsignificant CP violation effect is seen, and constraints are placed on the\nangle $\\gamma$ of the unitarity triangle formed from elements of the\nCabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa quark mixing matrix. Hadronic parameters associated\nwith the $B^0 \\to D K^*(892)^0$ decay are determined for the first time. These\nmeasurements can be used to improve the sensitivity to $\\gamma$ of existing and\nfuture studies of the $B^0 \\to D K^*(892)^0$ decay.\n", "  We study theoretically the spontaneous edge current in a small chiral\nsuperconductor with surface roughness. We obtained self-consistent solutions of\nthe pair potential and the vector potential by solving the quasiclassical\nEilenberger equation and the Maxwell equation simultaneously. We then employed\nthem to calculate numerically the spatial distribution of the chiral edge\ncurrent in a small superconductor. The characteristic behavior of the\nspontaneous edge current depends strongly on the symmetries of the order\nparameters such as chiral $p$-, chiral $d$- and chiral $f$-wave pairing. The\nedge current is robust under the surface roughness in the chiral $p$- and\nchiral $d$-wave superconductors. In the chiral $d$-wave case, the surface\nroughness tends to flip the direction of the chiral current. On the other hand,\nthe edge current in a chiral $f$-wave superconductor is fragile when there is\nsurface roughness. We also discuss the temperature dependence of a spontaneous\nmagnetization, which is a measurable value in standard experiments.\n", "  The glass transition remains one of the great unsolved mysteries of\ncontemporary condensed matter physics. When crystallization is bypassed by\nrapid cooling, a supercooled liquid, retaining amorphous particle arrangment,\nresults. The physical phenomenology of supercooled liquids is as vast as it is\ninteresting. Most significant, the viscosity of the supercooled liquid displays\nan incredible increase over a narrow temperature range. Eventually, the\nsupercooled liquid ceases to flow, becomes a glass, and gains rigidity and\nsolid-like behaviors. Understanding what underpins the monumental growth of\nviscosity, and how rigidity results without long range order is a long-sought\ngoal. Many theories of the glassy slowdown require the growth of static\nlengthscale related to structure with lowering of the temperature. To that end,\nwe have proposed a new, natural lengthscale- \"the shear penetration depth\".\nThis lengthscale quantifies the structural connectivity of the supercooled\nliquid. The shear penetration depth is defined as the distance up to which a\nshear perturbation applied to the boundary propagates into the liquid. We\nprovide numerical data, based on the simulations of $NiZr_2$, illustrating that\nthis length scale exhibits dramatic growth and eventual divergence upon\napproach to the glass transition. We further discuss this in relation to\npercolating structural connectivity and a new theory of the glass transition.\n", "  We present a supersymmetric version of a two-field relaxion model that\nnaturalizes tuned versions of supersymmetry. This arises from a relaxion\nmechanism that does not depend on QCD dynamics and where the relaxion potential\nbarrier height is controlled by a second axion-like field. During the\ncosmological evolution, the relaxion rolls with a nonzero value that breaks\nsupersymmetry and scans the soft supersymmetric mass terms. Electroweak\nsymmetry is broken after the soft masses become of order the supersymmetric\nHiggs mass term and causes the relaxion to stop rolling for superpartner masses\nup to $\\sim 10^9$ GeV. This can explain the tuning in supersymmetric models,\nincluding split-SUSY models, while preserving the QCD axion solution to the\nstrong CP problem. Besides predicting two very weakly-coupled axion-like\nparticles, the supersymmetric spectrum may contain an extra Goldstino, which\ncould be a viable dark matter candidate.\n", "  Experimental identification of quantum spin liquids remains a challenge, as\nthe pristine nature is to be seen in asymptotically low temperatures. We here\ntheoretically show that the precursor of quantum spin liquids appears in the\nspin dynamics in the paramagnetic state over a wide temperature range. Using\nthe cluster dynamical mean-field theory and the continuous-time quantum Monte\nCarlo method, which are newly developed in the Majorana fermion representation,\nwe calculate the dynamical spin structure factor, relaxation rate in nuclear\nmagnetic resonance, and magnetic susceptibility for the honeycomb Kitaev model\nwhose ground state is a canonical example of the quantum spin liquid. We find\nthat dynamical spin correlations show peculiar temperature and frequency\ndependence even below the temperature where static correlations saturate. The\nresults provide the experimentally-accessible symptoms of the fluctuating\nfractionalized spins evincing the quantum spin liquids.\n", "  The macroscopic spreading and mixing of solute plumes in saturated porous\nmedia is ultimately controlled by processes operating at the pore scale. Whilst\nthe conventional picture of pore-scale mechanical dispersion and molecular\ndiffusion leading to persistent hydrodynamic dispersion is well accepted, this\nparadigm is inherently two-dimensional (2D) in nature and neglects important\nthree-dimensional (3D) phenomena. We discuss how the kinematics of steady 3D\nflow at the porescale generate chaotic advection, involving exponential\nstretching and folding of fluid elements,the mechanisms by which it arises and\nimplications of microscopic chaos for macroscopic dispersion and mixing.\nProhibited in steady 2D flow due to topological constraints, these phenomena\nare ubiquitous due to the topological complexity inherent to all 3D porous\nmedia. Consequently 3D porous media flows generate profoundly different fluid\ndeformation and mixing processes to those of 2D flow. The interplay of chaotic\nadvection and broad transit time distributions can be incorporated into a\ncontinuous-time random walk (CTRW) framework to predict macroscopic solute\nmixing and spreading. We show how these results may be generalised to real\nporous architectures via a CTRW model of fluid deformation, leading to\nstochastic models of macroscopic dispersion and mixing which both honour the\npore-scale kinematics and are directly conditioned on the pore-scale\ntomography.\n", "  We analyze the dynamical response functions of strongly interacting quantum\ncritical states described by conformal field theories (CFTs). We construct a\nself-consistent holographic model that incorporates the relevant scalar\noperator driving the quantum critical phase transition. Focusing on the finite\ntemperature dynamical conductivity $\\sigma(\\omega,T)$, we study its dependence\non our model parameters, notably the scaling dimension of the relevant\noperator. It is found that the conductivity is well-approximated by a simple\nansatz proposed by Katz et al [1] for a wide range of parameters. We further\ndissect the conductivity at large frequencies $\\omega >> T$ using the operator\nproduct expansion, and show how it reveals the spectrum of our model CFT. Our\nresults provide a physically-constrained framework to study the analytic\ncontinuation of quantum Monte Carlo data, as we illustrate using the O(2)\nWilson-Fisher CFT. Finally, we comment on the variation of the conductivity as\nwe tune away from the quantum critical point, setting the stage for a\ncomprehensive analysis of the phase diagram near the transition.\n", "  We introduce a general framework for describing deformed phase spaces with\ngroup valued momenta. Using techniques from the theory of Poisson-Lie groups\nand Lie bi-algebras we develop tools for constructing Poisson structures on the\ndeformed phase space starting from the minimal input of the algebraic structure\nof the generators of the momentum Lie group. The tools developed are used to\nderive Poisson structures on examples of group momentum space much studied in\nthe literature such as the $n$-dimensional generalization of the\n$\\kappa$-deformed momentum space and the $SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$ momentum space in\nthree space-time dimensions. We discuss classical momentum observables\nassociated to multi-particle systems and argue that these combine according the\nusual four-vector addition despite the non-abelian group structure of momentum\nspace.\n", "  In this work, we explore the statistical physics of colloidal particles that\ninteract with electrolytes via ion-specific interactions. Firstly we study\nparticles interact weakly with electrolyte using linear response theory. We\nfind that the mean potential around a particle is linearly determined by the\n{\\em effective charge distribution} of the particle, which depends both on the\nbare charge distribution and on ion-specific interactions. We also discuss the\neffective interaction between two such particles and show that, in far field\nregime, it is bilinear in the effective charge distributions of two particles.\nWe subsequently generalize the above results to the more complicated case where\nparticles interact strongly with the electrolyte. Our results indicate that in\norder to understand the statistical physics of non-dilute electrolytes, both\nion-specific interactions and ionic correlations have to be addressed in a\nsingle unified and consistent framework.\n", "  Overlapping Feshbach resonances are commonly observed in experiments with\nultracold atoms and can influence the molecule production process. We derive an\neffective approach to describe magnetoassociation in an external trap in the\npresence of multiple overlapping resonances. We study how the strength and\nshape of the trap affects the energy level structure and demonstrate the\nexistence of a regime in which the conventional two-channel Landau-Zener\ndescription of the molecule production process breaks down.\n", "  Helicity is a topological invariant that measures the linkage and knottedness\nof lines, tubes and ribbons. As such, it has found myriads of applications in\nastrophysics and solar physics, in fluid dynamics, in atmospheric sciences, and\nin biology. In quantum flows, where topology-changing reconnection events are a\nstaple, helicity appears as a key quantity to study. However, the usual\ndefinition of helicity is not well posed in quantum vortices, and its\ncomputation based on counting links and crossings of vortex lines can be\ndownright impossible to apply in complex and turbulent scenarios. We present a\nnew definition of helicity which overcomes these problems. With it, we show\nthat only certain reconnection events conserve helicity. In other cases\nhelicity can change abruptly during reconnection. Furthermore, we show that\nthese events can also excite Kelvin waves, which slowly deplete helicity as\nthey interact nonlinearly, thus linking the theory of vortex knots with\nobservations of quantum turbulence.\n", "  Particles in the shape of chiral dipoles show a preferential rotation in\nthree dimensional homogeneous isotropic turbulence. A chiral dipole consists of\na rod with two helices of opposite handedness, one at each end. We can use 3d\nprinting to fabricate these particles with length in the inertial range and\ntrack their rotations in a turbulent flow between oscillating grids. High\naspect ratio chiral dipoles will align with the extensional eigenvectors of the\nstrain rate tensor and the helical ends will respond to the strain field by\nspinning around its long axis. The mean of the measured spinning rate is\nnon-zero and reflects the average stretching the particles experience. We use\nStokesian dynamics simulations of chiral dipoles in pure strain flow to\nquantify the dependence of spinning on particle shape. Based on the known\nresponse to pure strain, we build a model that gives the spinning rate of small\nchiral dipoles using Lagrangian velocity gradients from high resolution direct\nnumerical simulations. The statistics of chiral dipole spinning determined with\nthis model show surprisingly good agreement with the measured spinning of much\nlarger chiral dipoles in the experiments.\n", "  The spatio-temporal evolution and breaking of relativistically intense wave\npackets in a cold homogeneous unmagnetized plasma has been studied analytically\nand numerically. A general expression for phase mixing time scale as a function\nof amplitude of the wave packet and width of the spectrum has been derived.\nResults have been compared with the existing formulae in literature. It is\nshown that phase mixing time scale crucially depends on the relative magnitude\nof the amplitude and dimensionless spectral width of the wave packet. Finally\nwe have verified our results with respect to both the amplitude of the wave\npacket and width of the spectral using numerical simulations based on Dawson\nSheet Model.\n", "  Within effective field theory we explore the properties of the $d$=3+1\nquantum XY model at low temperatures and in weak magnetic or staggered fields.\nFor this parameter regime only few results appear to be known, and furthermore\nare restricted to one-loop order. In the present study we systematically\nanalyze the thermodynamics of the $d$=3+1 quantum XY model up to three-loop\norder. In the low-temperature expansion of the free energy density, the free\nBose gas term of order $T^4$ receives corrections of order $T^6$ and $T^8$. The\ndiscussion also includes the pressure, (staggered) magnetization and\nsusceptibility. In particular, we show how these quantities are influenced by\nthe spin-wave interaction. We then compare our findings with those for the\nquantum XY model in $d$=2+1.\n", "  Statistical properties for the recurrence of particles in an oval billiard\nwith a hole in the boundary are discussed. The hole is allowed to move in the\nboundary under two different types of motion: (i) counterclockwise periodic\ncirculation with a fixed step length and; (ii) random movement around the\nboundary. After injecting an ensemble of particles through the hole we show\nthat the surviving probability of the particles without recurring - without\nescaping - from the billiard is described by an exponential law and that the\nslope of the decay is proportional to the relative size of the hole. Since the\nphase space of the system exhibits islands of stability we show that there are\npreferred regions of escaping in the polar angle, hence given a partial answer\nto an open problem: {\\it Where to place a hole in order to maximize or minimize\na suitable defined measure of escaping}.\n", "  Monte Carlo and Active Subspace Identification methods are combined with\nfirst- and second-order adjoint sensitivities to perform (forward) uncertainty\nquantification analysis of the thermo-acoustic stability of two annular\ncombustor configurations. This method is applied to evaluate the risk factor,\ni.e., the probability for the system to be unstable. It is shown that the\nadjoint approach reduces the number of nonlinear-eigenproblem calculations by\nup to $\\sim\\mathcal{O}(M)$, as many as the Monte Carlo samples.\n", "  We propose an all-electrically controlled nanodevice - a gated semiconductor\nnanowire - capable of generating a coherent state of a single electron trapped\nin a harmonic oscillator or superposition of such coherent states - the\nSchr\\\"odinger cat state. In the proposed scheme, electron in the ground state\nof the harmonic potential is driven by resonantly oscillating Rashba spin-orbit\ncoupling. This allows for the creation of the Schr\\\"odinger cat state with\nsuperposition amplitudes depending on the initial electron spin state. Such a\nmethod can be used for initialization of a single spin qubit defined in a\ncoherent state. The harmonic confinement potential along the InSb nanowire and\nthe modulation of the Rashba spin-orbit coupling is obtained by proper gating.\nThe results are supported by realistic three-dimensional time-dependent self\nconsistent Poisson-Schr\\\"odinger calculations.\n", "  Nanomagnetic logic has emerged as a potential replacement for traditional\nCMOS-based logic because of superior energy-efficiency. One implementation of\nnanomagnetic logic employs shape-anisotropic (e.g. elliptical) ferromagnets\n(with two stable magnetization orientations) as binary switches that rely on\ndipole-dipole interaction to communicate binary information. Normally, circular\nnanomagnets are incompatible with this approach since they lack distinct stable\nin-plane magnetization orientations to encode bits. However, circular\nmagnetoelastic nanomagnets can be made bi-stable with a voltage induced\nanisotropic strain, which provides two significant advantages for nanomagnetic\nlogic applications. First, the shape anisotropy energy barrier is eliminated\nwhich reduces the amount of energy to reorient the dipole. Second, the in-plane\nsize can be reduced (~20nm) which was previously impossible due to thermal\nstability issues. In circular magnetoelastic nanomagnets, a voltage induced\nstrain stabilizes the magnetization even at this size overcoming the thermal\nstability issue. In this paper, we analytically demonstrate a binary logic wire\nimplemented with an array of circular nanomagnets that are clocked with\nvoltage-induced strain applied by an underlying piezoelectric substrate. This\nleads to an energy-efficient logic paradigm orders of magnitude superior to\nexisting CMOS-based logic that is scalable to dimensions substantially smaller\nthan those for existing nanomagnetic logic approaches. The analytical approach\nis validated with experimental measurements conducted on dipole coupled Ni\nnanodots fabricated on a PMN-PT sample.\n", "  We discuss the relation between Noether (point) symmetries and discrete\nsymmetries for a class of minisuperspace cosmological models. We show that when\na Noether symmetry exists for the gravitational Lagrangian then there exists a\ncoordinate system in which a reversal symmetry exists. Moreover as far as\nconcerns the scale-factor duality symmetry of the dilaton field, we show that\nit is related to the existence of a Noether symmetry for the field equations,\nand the reversal symmetry in the normal coordinates of the symmetry vector\nbecomes scale-factor duality symmetry in the original coordinates. In\nparticular the same point symmetry as also the same reversal symmetry exists\nfor the Brans-Dicke- scalar field with linear potential while now the discrete\nsymmetry in the original coordinates of the system depends on the Brans-Dicke\nparameter and it is a scale-factor duality when $\\omega_{BD}=1$. Furthermore,\nin the context of the O'Hanlon theory for $f\\left( R\\right) $-gravity, it is\npossible to show how a duality transformation in the minisuperspace can be used\nto relate different gravitational models.\n", "  Massive gas-rich galaxy discs at $z \\sim 1-3$ host massive star-forming\nclumps with typical baryonic masses in the range $10^7-10^8$~M$_{\\odot}$ which\ncan affect the orbital decay and concurrent growth of supermassive black hole\n(BH) pairs. Using a set of high-resolution simulations of isolated clumpy\ngalaxies hosting a pair of unequal-mass BHs, we study the interaction between\nmassive clumps and a BH pair at kpc scales, during the early phase of the\norbital decay. We find that both the interaction with massive clumps and the\nheating of the cold gas layer of the disc by BH feedback tend to delay\nsignificantly the orbital decay of the secondary, which in many cases is\nejected and then hovers for a whole Gyr around a separation of 1--2 kpc. In the\nenvelope, dynamical friction is weak and there is no contribution of disc\ntorques: these lead to the fastest decay once the orbit of the secondary BH has\ncircularised in the disc midplane. In runs with larger eccentricities the delay\nis stronger, although there are some exceptions. We also show that, even in\ndiscs with very sporadic transient clump formation, a strong spiral pattern\naffects the decay time-scale for BHs on eccentric orbits. We conclude that,\ncontrary to previous belief, a gas-rich background is not necessarily conducive\nto a fast BH decay and binary formation, which prompts more extensive\ninvestigations aimed at calibrating event-rate forecasts for ongoing and future\ngravitational-wave searches, such as with Pulsar Timing Arrays and the future\nevolved Laser Interferometer Space Antenna.\n", "  We explore a new class of natural models which ensure the one-loop\ndivergences in the Higgs mass are cancelled. The top-partners that cancel the\ntop loop are new gauge bosons, and the symmetry relation that ensures the\ncancellation arises at an infrared fixed point. Such a cancellation mechanism\ncan, a la Little Higgs models, push the scale of new physics that completely\nsolves the hierarchy problem up to 5-10 TeV. When embedded in a supersymmetric\nmodel, the stop and gaugino masses provide the cutoffs for the loops, and the\nmechanism ensures a cancellation between the stop and gaugino mass dependence\nof the Higgs mass parameter.\n", "  The method of mathematical modeling was used for the calculation of the\nstructural, electronic, phonon, and other characteristics of various normal\nphases of phosphorus hydrides with stoichiometry PHk. It was shown that the\ndi-phosphine may form 2D lattice of the metallic hydrogen, stabilized by\nphosphorus atoms under high hydrostatic compressive pressure. The resulting\nstructure with the elements of H-P-H is a locally stable one in the phonon\nspectrum (or metastable). The properties of di-phosphine with the properties of\nsimilar structures such as thesulphur hydrides were compared.\n", "  We treat a problem at the interface of dynamical systems and equilibrium\nstatistical physics. It is well-known that the geometric pressure function\n$$t\\in\\mathbb R\\mapsto \\sup_{\\mu}\\left\\{h_\\mu(T_2)-t\\int\\log\n|dT_2(x)|d\\mu(x)\\right\\}$$ of the Chebyshev quadratic map $T_2(x)=1-2x^2$\n$(x\\in\\mathbb R)$ is not differentiable at $t=-1$. We show that this phase\ntransition can be \"removed\", by an arbitrarily small singular perturbation of\nthe map $T_2$ into H\\'enon-like diffeomorphisms. A proof of this result relies\non an elaboration of the well-known inducing techniques adapted to H\\'enon-like\ndynamics near the first bifurcation.\n", "  We study spectral properties of Schr\\\"odinger operators with\n$\\delta$-interactions on a semi-axis by using the theory of boundary triplets\nand the corresponding Weyl functions. We establish a connection between\nspectral properties (deficiency indices, self-adjointness, semiboundedness,\ndiscreteness of spectra, resolvent comparability etc.) of Schr\\\"odinger\noperators with point interactions and a special class of block Jacobi matrices.\n", "  Recent results of meson photo-production at the existing electron machines\nwith polarized real photon beams and the measurement of polarization\nobservables of the final state baryons have provided high precision data that\nled to the discovery of new excited nucleon and $\\Delta$ states using\nmulti-channel partial wave analyses procedures. The internal structure of\nseveral prominent excited states has been revealed employing meson\nelectroproduction processes. On the theoretical front, lattice QCD is now\npredicting the baryon spectrum with very similar characteristics as the\nconstituent quark model, and continuum QCD, such as is represented in the\nDyson-Schwinger Equations approach and in light front relativistic quark\nmodels, describes the non-perturbative behavior of resonance excitations at\nphoton virtuality of $Q^2 > 1.5GeV^2$. In this talk I discuss the need to\ncontinue a vigorous program of nucleon spectroscopy and the study of the\ninternal structure of excited states as a way to reveal the effective degrees\nof freedom underlying the excited states and their dependence on the distance\nscale probed.\n", "  In the context of studying the 4D effective potentials of type IIB\nnon-geometric flux compactifications, this article has a twofold goal. First,\nwe present a modular invariant symplectic rearrangement of the tree level\nnon-geometric scalar potential arising from a flux superpotential which\nincludes the S-dual pairs of non-geometric fluxes $(Q, P)$, the standard NS-NS\nand RR three-form fluxes $(F_3, H_3)$ and the geometric flux ($\\omega$). This\n`symplectic formulation' is valid for arbitrary numbers of K\\\"ahler moduli, and\nthe complex structure moduli which are implicitly encoded in a set of\nsymplectic matrices.\n  In the second part, we further explicitly rewrite all the symplectic\ningredients in terms of saxionic and axionic components of the complex\nstructure moduli. The same leads to a compact form of the generic scalar\npotential being explicitly written out in terms of all the real moduli/axions.\nMoreover, the final form of the scalar potential needs only the knowledge of\nsome topological data (such as hodge numbers and the triple intersection\nnumbers) of the compactifying (CY) threefolds and their respective mirrors.\nFinally, we demonstrate how the same is equivalent to say that, for a given\nconcrete example, various pieces of the scalar potential can be directly read\noff from our generic proposal, without the need of starting from the K\\\"ahler-\nand super-potentials.\n", "  We study theoretically the effects of long-range and on-site Coulomb\ninteractions on the topological phases and transport properties of\nspin-orbit-coupled quasi-one-dimensional quantum wires imposed on an s-wave\nsuperconductor. The electrostatic potential and charge density distributions\nare computed self-consistently within the Hartree approximation. Due to the\nfinite width of the wires and the charge repulsion, the potential and density\ndistribute inhomogeneously in the transverse direction and tend to accumulate\nalong the lateral edges where the hard-wall confinement is assumed. This result\nhas profound effects on the topological phases and the differential conductance\nof the interacting quantum wires and their hybrid junctions with\nsuperconductors. Coulomb interactions renormalize the chemical potential, and\nalter the topological phases strongly by enhancing the topological regimes and\nproducing jagged boundaries. Moreover, the multicritical points connecting\ndifferent topological phases from high-index subbands are modified remarkably\nin striking contrast to the predictions of the two-band model. We further\nsuggest the possible non-magnetic topological phase transitions manipulated\nexternally with the aid of long-range interactions. Finally, the transport\nproperties of normal-superconductor junctions are also examined and interaction\nimpacts on the emergence of Majorana fermions and the strength of Majorana\nzero-bias peaks are revealed.\n", "  We study the radiation emitted by inertial charge evolving on the expanding\nde Sitter spacetime. Performing a perturbative calculation, within scalar\nquantum electrodynamics (sQED), we obtain the transition amplitude for the\nprocess and using this we define the energy radiated by the source. In the\nnon-relativistic limit we find that the leading term is compatible with the\nclassical result (Larmor formula). The first quantum correction is found to be\nnegative, a result which is in line with a number of similar quantum field\ntheory results. For the ultra-relativistic case we find a logarithmic\ndivergence of the emitted energy for large frequencies, which we link to the\nnature of the spacetime. We compare our results with that of Nomura et al.\n(2006), where the authors make a similar calculation for a general conformally\nflat spacetime.\n", "  $\\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ has been hinted as a spin-orbital-assisted Mott insulator\nin proximity to a Kitaev spin liquid state. Here we present ARPES measurements\non single crystal $\\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ in both the pristine and electron-doped\nstates, and combine them with LDA+SOC+U calculations performed for the several\nlow-energy competing magnetically ordered states as well as the paramagnetic\nstate. A large Mott gap is found in the measured band structure of the pristine\ncompound that persists to more than 20 times beyond the magnetic ordering\ntemperature, though the paramagnetic calculation shows almost no gap. Upon\nelectron doping, spectral weight is transferred into the gap but the new states\nstill maintain a sizable gap from the Fermi edge. These findings are most\nconsistent with a Mott insulator with a somewhat exotic evolution out of the\nMott state with both temperature and doping, likely related to unusually strong\nspin fluctuations.\n", "  We re-examine a closed-string model defined by altering the boundary\nconditions for one handedness of two-dimensional propagators in\notherwise-standard string theory. We evaluate the amplitudes using\nKawai-Lewellen-Tye factorization into open-string amplitudes. The only\nmodification to standard string theory is effectively that the spacetime\nMinkowski metric changes overall sign in one open-string factor. This cancels\nall but a finite number of states: As found in earlier approaches, with enough\nsupersymmetry (e.g., type II) the tree amplitudes reproduce those of the\nmassless truncation of ordinary string theory. However, we now find for the\nother cases that additional fields, formerly thought to be auxiliary, describe\nnew spin-2 states at the two adjacent mass levels (tachyonic and tardyonic).\nThe tachyon is always a ghost, but can be avoided in the heterotic case.\n", "  Negative magnetoresistivity is a special magnetotransport property associated\nwith chiral anomaly in four dimensional chiral anomalous systems, which refers\nto the transport behavior that the DC longitudinal magnetoresistivity decreases\nwith increasing magnetic field. We calculate the longitudinal\nmagnetoconductivity in the presence of backreactions of the magnetic field to\ngravity in holographic zero charge and axial charge density systems with and\nwithout axial charge dissipation. In the absence of axial charge dissipation,\nwe find that the quantum critical conductivity grows with increasing magnetic\nfield when the backreaction strength is larger than a critical value, in\ncontrast to the monotonically decreasing behavior of quantum critical\nconductivity in the probe limit. With axial charge dissipation, we find the\nnegative magnetoresistivity behavior. The DC longitudinal magnetoconductivity\nscales as $B$ in the large magnetic field limit, which deviates from the exact\n$B^2$ scaling of the probe limit result. In both cases, the small frequency\nlongitudinal magnetoconductivity still agrees with the formula obtained from\nthe hydrodynamic linear response theory, even in the large magnetic field\nlimit.\n", "  In this paper, we determine the charge lattice of mutually local Wilson and\n't Hooft line operators for class S theories living on M5-branes wrapped on\ncompact Riemann surfaces. The main ingredients of our analysis are the\nfundamental group of the N-cover of the Riemann surface, and a quantum\nconstraint on the six-dimensional theory. This latter plays a central role in\nexcluding some of the possible lattices and imposing consistency conditions on\nthe charges. This construction gives a geometric explanation for the mutual\nlocality among the lines, fixing their charge lattice and the structure of the\nfour-dimensional gauge group.\n", "  In this paper we derive new two-component integrable differential difference\nand partial difference systems by applying a Lax-Darboux scheme to an operator\nformed from an ${\\mathfrak{sl}}_3({\\mathbb{C}})$-based automorphic Lie algebra.\nThe integrability of the found systems is demonstrated via Lax pairs and\ngeneralised symmetries.\n", "  The ripening kinetics of bubbles is studied by performing molecular dynamics\nsimulations. From the time evolution of a system, the growth rates of\nindividual bubbles are determined. At low temperatures, the system exhibits a\n$t^{1/2}$ law and the growth rate is well described by classical\nLifshitz-Slyozov-Wagner (LSW) theory for the reaction-limited case. This is\ndirect evidence that the bubble coarsening at low temperatures is\nreaction-limited. At high temperatures, although the system exhibits a\n$t^{1/3}$ law, which suggests that it is diffusion-limited, the accuracy of the\ngrowth rate is insufficient to determine whether the form is consistent with\nthe prediction of LSW theory for the diffusion-limited case. The gas volume\nfraction dependence of the coarsening behavior is also studied. Although the\nbehavior of the system at low temperatures has little sensitivity to the gas\nvolume fraction up to 10%, that at high temperatures deviates from the\nprediction of LSW theory for the diffusion-limited case as the gas volume\nfraction increases. These results show that the mean-field-like treatment is\nvalid for a reaction-limited system even with a finite volume fraction, while\nit becomes inappropriate for a diffusion-limited system since classical LSW\ntheory for the diffusion-limited case is valid at the dilute limit.\n", "  The diphoton excesses at 750 GeV seen in the LHC data may be the first hint\nfor new physics at the TeV scale. We discuss variations of the model considered\nearlier, in which one or more diphoton excesses arise from composite pseudo\nNambu-Goldstone bosons (hidden pions) associated with new strong dynamics at\nthe TeV scale. We study the case in which the 750 GeV excess arises from a\nunique hidden pion leading to a diphoton final state as well as the case in\nwhich it arises from one of the hidden pions decaying into diphotons. We\nconsider SU(N), SO(N), and Sp(N) gauge groups for the strong dynamics and find\nthat SO(N) and Sp(N) models give extra hidden pions beyond those in the SU(N)\nmodels, which can be used to discriminate among models.\n", "  Despite its historical importance, a perfect gas enclosed by a pistons and in\ncontact with a thermal reservoirs is a system still largely under study. Its\nthermodynamic properties are not yet well understood when driven under\nnon-equilibrium conditions. In particular, analytic formulas that describe the\nheat exchanged with the reservoir are rare. In this paper we prove a power\nseries expansions for the heat when both the external force and the reservoir\ntemperature are slowly varying over time but the overall process is not\nquasi-static. To do so, we use the dynamical equations from [Cerino \\emph{et\nal.}, \\textit{Phys. Rev. E}, \\textbf{91} 032128] and an uncommon application of\nthe regular perturbation technique.\n", "  We present global fits of an effective field theory description of real, and\ncomplex scalar dark matter candidates. We simultaneously take into account all\npossible dimension 6 operators consisting of dark matter bilinears and gauge\ninvariant combinations of quark and gluon fields. We derive constraints on the\nfree model parameters for both the real (five parameters) and complex (seven)\nscalar dark matter models obtained by combining Planck data on the cosmic\nmicrowave background, direct detection limits from LUX, and indirect detection\nlimits from the Fermi Large Area Telescope. We find that for real scalars\nindirect dark matter searches disfavour a dark matter particle mass below 100\nGeV. For the complex scalar dark matter particle current data have a limited\nimpact due to the presence of operators that lead to p-wave annihilation, and\nalso do not contribute to the spin-independent scattering cross- section.\nAlthough current data are not informative enough to strongly constrain the\ntheory parameter space, we demonstrate the power of our formalism to\nreconstruct the theoretical parameters compatible with an actual dark matter\ndetection, by assuming that the excess of gamma rays observed by the Fermi\nLarge Area Telescope towards the Galactic centre is entirely due to dark matter\nannihilations. Please note that the excess can very well be due to\nastrophysical sources such as millisecond pulsars. We find that scalar dark\nmatter interacting via effective field theory operators can in principle\nexplain the Galactic centre excess, but that such interpretation is in strong\ntension with the non-detection of gamma rays from dwarf galaxies in the real\nscalar case. In the complex scalar case there is enough freedom to relieve the\ntension.\n", "  The energy efficiency of the spin Hall effects (SHE) can be enhanced if the\nelectrical conductivity is decreased without sacrificing the spin Hall\nconductivity. The resistivity of Pt films can be increased to 150-300\n{\\mu}{\\Omega}*cm by mesoscopic lateral confinement, thereby decreasing the\nconductivity. The SHE and inverse spin Hall effects (ISHE) in these mesoscopic\nPt films are explored at 10 K by using the nonlocal spin injection/detection\nmethod. All relevant physical quantities are determined in-situ on the same\nsubstrate, and a quantitative approach is developed to characterize all\nprocesses effectively. Extensive measurements with various Pt thickness values\nreveal an upper limit for the Pt spin diffusion length: {\\lambda}_pt<0.8 nm.\nThe average product of {\\lambda}_pt and the Pt spin Hall angle {\\alpha}_H is\nsubstantial: {\\alpha}_H*{\\lambda}_pt=(0.142 +/- 0.040)nm for 4 nm thick Pt,\nthough a gradual decrease is observed at larger Pt thickness. The results\nsuggest enhanced spin Hall effects in resistive mesoscopic Pt films.\n", "  A search is presented for the production of two Higgs bosons in final states\ncontaining two photons and two bottom quarks. Both resonant and nonresonant\nhypotheses are investigated. The analyzed data correspond to an integrated\nluminosity of 19.7 inverse femtobarns of proton-proton collisions at sqrt(s) =\n8 TeV collected with the CMS detector. Good agreement is observed between data\nand predictions of the standard model (SM). Upper limits are set at 95%\nconfidence level on the production cross section of new particles and compared\nto the prediction for the existence of a warped extra dimension. When the decay\nto two Higgs bosons is kinematically allowed, assuming a mass scale Lambda[R] =\n1 TeV for the model, the data exclude a radion scalar at masses below 980 GeV.\nThe first Kaluza-Klein excitation mode of the graviton in the RS1\nRandall-Sundrum model is excluded for masses between 325 and 450 GeV. An upper\nlimit of 0.71 pb is set on the nonresonant two-Higgs-boson cross section in the\nSM-like hypothesis. Limits are also derived on nonresonant production assuming\nanomalous Higgs boson couplings.\n", "  The analytic continuation from the Euclidean domain to real space of the\none-particle irreducible quantum effective action is discussed in the context\nof generalized local equilibrium states. Discontinuous terms associated with\ndissipative behavior are parametrized in terms of a conveniently defined sign\noperator. A generalized variational principle is then formulated, which allows\nto obtain causal and real dissipative equations of motion from the analytically\ncontinued quantum effective action. Differential equations derived from the\nimplications of general covariance determine the space-time evolution of the\ntemperature and fluid velocity fields and allow for a discussion of entropy\nproduction including a local form of the second law of thermodynamics.\n", "  Detection of dynamic surface displacements associated with local changes in\nmaterial strain provides access to a number of phenomena and material\nproperties. Contact resonance-enhanced methods of Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM)\nhave been shown capable of detecting ~1-3 pm-level surface displacements, an\napproach used in techniques such as piezoresponse force microscopy, atomic\nforce acoustic microscopy, and ultrasonic force microscopy. Here, based on an\nanalytical model of AFM cantilever vibrations, we demonstrate a guideline to\nquantify surface displacements with a high accuracy by taking into account the\ncantilever shape at the first resonant contact mode depending on the tip-sample\ncontact stiffness. The approach has been experimentally verified and further\ndeveloped for the piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) using well-defined\nferroelectric materials. These results open up a way to accurate and precise\nmeasurements of the surface displacement as well as piezoelectric constants at\nthe pm-scale with nanometer spatial resolution and will allow avoiding\nerroneous data interpretations and measurement artefacts. This analysis is\ndirectly applicable to all cantilever-resonance-based SPM techniques.\n", "  In this Rapid Communication, we investigate the universal properties of a\nspin-polarized two-component Fermi gas in one dimension (1D) using Bethe\nansatz. We discuss the quantum phases and phase transitions by obtaining exact\nresults for the equation of state, the contact, the magnetic susceptibility and\nthe contact susceptibility, giving a precise understanding of the 1D analogue\nof the Bose-Einstein condensation and Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer crossover in\nthree dimension (3D) and the associated universal magnetic properties. In\nparticular, we obtain the exact form of the magnetic susceptibility $\\chi \\sim\n{1}/{\\sqrt{T}}\\exp(-\\Delta/T)$ at low temperatures, where $\\Delta$ is the\nenergy gap and $T$ is the temperature. Moreover, we establish exact upper and\nlower bounds for the relation between polarization $P$ and the contact $C$ for\nboth repulsive and attractive Fermi gases. Our findings emphasize the role of\nthe pair fluctuations in strongly interacting 1D fermion systems that can shed\nlight on higher dimensions.\n", "  Physical vapor deposition (PVD) is widely used in manufacturing ultra-thin\nlayers of amorphous organic solids. Here, we demonstrate that these films\nexhibit a sharp transition from glassy solid to liquid-like behavior with\nthickness below 30 nm. This liquid-like behavior persists even at temperatures\nwell below the glass transition temperature, T$_{\\mathrm{g}}$. The enhanced\ndynamics in these films can produce large scale morphological features during\nPVD and lead to a dewetting instability in films held at temperatures as low as\nT$_{\\mathrm{g}}$-35 K. We measure the effective viscosity of organic glass\nfilms by monitoring the dewetting kinetics. These measurements combined with\ncooling rate-dependent T$_{\\mathrm{g}}$ measurements show that the apparent\nactivation barrier for rearrangement decreases sharply in films thinner than 30\nnm. These observations suggest long-range facilitation of dynamics induced by\nthe free surface, with dramatic effects on the properties of nano-scale\namorphous materials.\n", "  The structural, vibrational, thermodynamical and optical properties of\ntechnologically important, weakly coupled MAX compound, Sc2AlC are calculated\nusing density functional theory (DFT). The structural properties of Sc2AlC are\ncompared with results reported earlier. The vibrational, thermodynamical, and\noptical properties are theoretically estimated for the first time. The phonon\ndispersion curve has been calculated and the dynamical stability of this\ncompound has been investigated. The optical and acoustic modes are observed\nclearly. We have calculated the Helmholtz free energy (F), internal energy (E),\nentropy (S) and specific heat capacity (Cv) from the phonon density of states.\nVarious optical parameters have also been calculated. The reflectance spectrum\nshows that it this compound has the potential to be used as a solar reflector.\n", "  The conditions under which stable evolution of two nonlinear interacting\nwaves are derived within the context of nematic crystals. Two cases are\nconsidered: plane waves and solitons. In the first case, the modulation\ninstability analysis reveals that while the nonlocal term suppresses the growth\nrates, substantially, the coupled system exhibits significantly higher growth\nrates than its scalar counterpart. In the soliton case, the necessary\nconditions are derived that lead the solitons to exhibit stable, undistorted\nevolution, suppressing any breathing behavior and radiation, leading to soliton\nmutual guiding.\n", "  In this paper, conditions for existence of G\\\"{o}del and G\\\"{o}del-type\nsolutions in Brans-Dicke (BD) scalar-tensor theory and their main features are\nstudied. The consistency of equations of motion, causality violation and\nexistence of CTCs (closed time-like curves) are investigated. The role which\ncosmological constant and Mach principle play to achieve the consistency of\nthis model is studied.\n", "  Spherically symmetric dust universe models with a positive cosmological\nconstant $\\Lambda$, known as $\\Lambda$-Lema\\^itre-Tolman-Bondi($\\Lambda$LTB)\nmodels, are considered. We report a method to construct the $\\Lambda$LTB model\nfrom a given distance-redshift relation observed at the symmetry center. The\nspherical inhomogeneity is assumed to be composed of growing modes. We derive a\nset of ordinary differential equations for three functions of the redshift,\nwhich specify the spherical inhomogeneity. Once a distance-redshift relation is\ngiven, with careful treatment of possible singular points, we can uniquely\ndetermine the model by solving the differential equations for each value of\n$\\Lambda$. As a demonstration, we fix the distance-redshift relation as that of\nthe flat $\\Lambda$CDM model with $(\\Omega^{\\rm dis}_{\\rm m0}, \\Omega^{\\rm\ndis}_{\\rm \\Lambda 0})=(0.3,0.7)$, where $\\Omega^{\\rm dis}_{\\rm m0}$ and\n$\\Omega^{\\rm dis}_{\\rm \\Lambda 0}$ are the normalized matter density and the\ncosmological constant, respectively. Then, we construct the $\\Lambda$LTB model\nfor several values of $\\Omega_{\\rm \\Lambda 0}:=\\Lambda/(3H_0^2)$, where $H_0$\nis the present Hubble parameter observed at the symmetry center. We obtain void\nstructure around the symmetry center for $\\Omega_{\\Lambda 0}<\\Omega^{\\rm\ndis}_{\\Lambda 0}$. We show the relation between the ratio\n$\\Omega_{\\Lambda0}/\\Omega^{\\rm dis}_{\\Lambda 0}$ and the amplitude of the\ninhomogeneity.\n", "  The phenomenon of electronic wave localization through disorder was\nintroduced by Anderson in 1958 in the context of electron transport in solids.\nIt remains an important area of fundamental and applied research. Localization\nof all wave phenomena, including light, is thought to exist in a restricted one\ndimensional geometry. We present here a series of experiments which illustrate,\nusing a simple experimental arrangement and approach, localization of light in\na quasi one dimensional physical system. In the experiments, reflected and\ntransmitted light from a stack of glass slides of varying thickness reveals an\nOhm's Law type behavior for small thicknesses, and evolution to exponential\ndecay of the transmitted power for thicker slide stacks. Light absorption is\nnegligible in our realization of the experiment. For larger stacks of slides,\nweak departure from a one dimensional behavior is also observed. The experiment\nand analysis of the results, then showing many of the essential features of\nwave localization, is relatively straightforward, economical, and suitable for\nlaboratory experiments at an undergraduate level.\n", "  We consider deterministic walks on square, triangular and hexagonal two\ndimensional lattices. In each case, there is a scatterer at every site that can\nbe in one of two states that force the walker to turn either to his/her\nimmediate right or left. After the walker is scattered, the scatterer changes\nstate. A lattice with an arrangement of scatterers is an environment. We show\nthat there are only two environments for which the scattering rules are\ninjective, mirrors or rotators, on the three lattices. On hexagonal lattices,\nB. Z. Webb and E. G. D. Cohen, proved that given an initial position and\nvelocity of the walker and an environment of one type of scatterers, mirrrors\nor rotators, there is an environment of the other type such that the walks on\nboth environments are equivalent, meaning they visit the same sites at the same\ntime steps. We prove the equivalence of walks on square and triangular lattices\nand include a proof of the equivalence of walks on hexagonal lattices. The\nproofs are based both on the geometry of the lattice and the structure of the\nscattering rule.\n", "  We introduce a subtraction method for jet cross sections at\nnext-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) accuracy in the strong coupling and use it\nto compute event shapes in three-jet production in electron-positron\ncollisions. We validate our method on two event shapes, thrust and C-parameter,\nwhich are already known in the literature at NNLO accuracy and compute for the\nfirst time oblateness and the energy-energy correlation at the same accuracy.\n", "  The spin crossover of iron in Fe$^{3+}$-bearing bridgmanite, the most\nabundant mineral of the Earth's lower mantle, is by now a well-established\nphenomenon, though several aspects of this crossover remain unclear. Here we\ninvestigate effects of disorder, iron concentration, and temperature on this\ncrossover using ab initio LDA + U$_{sc}$ calculations. The effect of\nconcentration and disorder are addressed using complete statistical samplings\nof coupled substituted configurations in super-cells containing up to 80 atoms.\nVibrational/thermal effects on the crossover are addressed within the\nquasiharmonic approximation. The effect of disorder seems quite small, while\nincreasing iron concentration results in considerable increase in crossover\npressure. Our calculated compression curves for iron-free, Fe$^{2+}$-, and\nFe$^{3+}$-bearing bridgmanite compare well with the latest experimental\nmeasurements. The comparison also suggests that in a close system, Fe$^{2+}$\npresent in the sample may transform into Fe$^{3+}$ by introduction of Mg and O\nvacancies with increasing pressure. As in the spin crossover in ferropericlase,\nthis crossover in bridgmanite is accompanied by a clear volume reduction and an\nanomalous softening of the bulk modulus throughout the crossover pressure\nrange. These effects reduce significantly with increasing temperature. Though\nthe concentration of [Fe$^{3+}$]$_{Si}$ in bridgmanite may be small, related\nelastic anomalies may impact the interpretation of radial and lateral velocity\nstructures of the Earth's lower mantle.\n", "  Observations of exoplanet atmospheres have revealed the presence of cloud\nparticles in their atmospheres. 3D modelling of cloud formation in atmospheres\nof extrasolar planets coupled to the atmospheric dynamics has long been a\nchallenge. We investigate the thermo-hydrodynamic properties of cloud formation\nprocesses in the atmospheres of hot Jupiter exoplanets. We simulate the dynamic\natmosphere of HD 189733b with a 3D model that couples 3D\nradiative-hydrodynamics with a kinetic, microphysical mineral cloud formation\nmodule designed for RHD/GCM exoplanet atmosphere simulations. Our simulation\nincludes the feedback effects of cloud advection and settling, gas phase\nelement advection and depletion/replenishment and the radiative effects of\ncloud opacity. We model the cloud particles as a mix of mineral materials which\nchange in size and composition as they travel through atmospheric\nthermo-chemical environments. All local cloud properties such as number\ndensity, grain size and material composition are time-dependently calculated.\nGas phase element depletion as a result of cloud formation is included in the\nmodel. In-situ \\textit{effective medium theory} and Mie theory is applied to\ncalculate the wavelength dependent opacity of the cloud component. We present a\n3D cloud structure of a chemically complex, gaseous atmosphere of the hot\nJupiter HD 189733b. Mean cloud particle sizes are typically sub-micron\n(0.01-0.5 $\\mu$m) at pressures less than 1 bar with hotter equatorial regions\ncontaining the smallest grains. Denser cloud structures occur near terminator\nregions and deeper ($\\sim$ 1 bar) atmospheric layers. Silicate materials such\nas MgSiO$_{3}$[s] are found to be abundant at mid-high latitudes, while\nTiO$_{2}$[s] and SiO$_{2}$[s] dominate the equatorial regions.\n", "  We present an ab initio study of the electronic stopping power of protons in\ncopper over a wide range of proton velocities $v = 0.02-10~\\mathrm{a.u.}$ where\nwe take into account non-linear effects. Time-dependent density functional\ntheory coupled with molecular dynamics is used to study electronic excitations\nproduced by energetic protons. A plane-wave pseudopotential scheme is employed\nto solve the time-dependent Kohn-Sham equations for a moving ion in a periodic\ncrystal. The electronic excitations and the band structure determine the\nstopping power of the material and alter the interatomic forces for both\nchanneling and off-channeling trajectories. Our off-channeling results are in\nquantitative agreement with experiments, and at low velocity they unveil a\ncrossover region of superlinear velocity dependence (with a power of $\\sim\n1.5$) in the velocity range $v = 0.07-0.3~\\mathrm{a.u.}$, which we associate to\nthe copper crystalline electronic band structure. The results are rationalized\nby simple band models connecting two separate regimes. We find that the limit\nof electronic stopping $v\\to 0$ is not as simple as phenomenological models\nsuggest and it plagued by band-structure effects.\n", "  We demonstrate a wide-band all-optical method of nanoscale magnetic resonance\n(MR) spectroscopy under ambient conditions. Our method relies on\ncross-relaxation between a probe spin, the electronic spin of a\nnitrogen-vacancy centre in diamond, and target spins as the two systems are\ntuned into resonance. By optically monitoring the spin relaxation time ($T_1$)\nof the probe spin while varying the amplitude of an applied static magnetic\nfield, a frequency spectrum of the target spin resonances, a $T_1$-MR spectrum,\nis obtained. As a proof of concept, we measure $T_1$-MR spectra of a small\nensemble of $^{14}$N impurities surrounding the probe spin within the diamond,\nwith each impurity comprising an electron spin 1/2 and a nuclear spin 1. The\nintrinsically large bandwidth of the technique and probe properties allows us\nto detect both electron spin transitions -- in the GHz range -- and nuclear\nspin transitions -- in the MHz range -- of the $^{14}$N spin targets. The\nmeasured frequencies are found to be in excellent agreement with theoretical\nexpectations, and allow us to infer the hyperfine, quadrupole and gyromagnetic\nconstants of the target spins. Analysis of the strength of the resonances\nobtained in the $T_1$-MR spectrum reveals that the electron spin transitions\nare probed via dipole interactions, while the nuclear spin resonances are\ndramatically enhanced by hyperfine coupling and an electron-mediated process.\nFinally, we investigate theoretically the possibility of performing $T_1$-MR\nspectroscopy on nuclear spins without hyperfine interaction and predict\nsingle-proton sensitivity using current technology. This work establishes\n$T_1$-MR as a simple yet powerful technique for nanoscale MR spectroscopy, with\nbroadband capability and a projected sensitivity down to the single nuclear\nspin level.\n", "  Natural realisations of supersymmetry require light stops ${\\tilde t}_1$,\nmaking them a prime target of LHC searches for physics beyond the Standard\nModel. Depending on the kinematic region, the main search channels are ${\\tilde\nt_1}\\to t \\tilde \\chi^0_1$, ${\\tilde t_1}\\to W b \\tilde \\chi^0_1$ and ${\\tilde\nt_1}\\to c \\tilde \\chi^0_1$. We first examine the interplay of these decay modes\nwith ${\\tilde c_1}\\to c \\tilde \\chi^0_1$ in a model-independent fashion,\nrevealing the existence of large regions in parameter space which are excluded\nfor any ${\\tilde t_1}\\to c \\tilde \\chi^0_1$ branching ratio. This effect is\nthen illustrated for scenarios with stop-scharm mixing in the right-handed\nsector, where it has previously been observed that the stop mass limits can be\nsignificantly weakened for large mixing. Our analysis shows that once the LHC\nbounds from ${\\tilde c_1}\\to c \\tilde \\chi^0_1$ searches are taken into\naccount, non-zero stop-scharm mixing leads only to a modest increase in the\nallowed regions of parameter space, with large areas excluded for arbitrary\nmixing angles.\n", "  We evaluated the planetary radar capabilities at Arecibo, the Goldstone 70-m\nDSS-14 and 34-m DSS-13 antennas, the 70-m DSS-43 antenna at Canberra, the Green\nBank Telescope, and the Parkes Radio Telescope in terms of their relative\nsensitivities and the number of known near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) detectable\nper year in monostatic and bistatic configurations. In the 2015 calendar year,\nmonostatic observations with Arecibo and DSS-14 were capable of detecting 253\nand 131 NEAs respectively, with signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) greater than\n30/track. Combined, the two observatories were capable of detecting 276 NEAs.\nOf these, Arecibo detected 77 and Goldstone detected 32, or 30% and 24% the\nnumbers that were possible. The two observatories detected an additional 18 and\n7 NEAs respectively, with SNRs of less than 30/track. This indicates that a\nsubstantial number of potential targets are not being observed. The bistatic\nconfiguration with DSS-14 transmitting and the Green Bank Telescope receiving\nwas capable of detecting about 195 NEAs, or ~50% more than with monostatic\nobservations at DSS-14. Most of the detectable asteroids were targets of\nopportunity that were discovered less than 15 days before the end of their\nobserving windows. About 50% of the detectable asteroids have absolute\nmagnitudes > 25, which corresponds diameters < ~30 m.\n", "  The reaction $^{11}B+p$ has been used to populate the $(J^{\\pi},T)=(2^+,1)$\nstate at an excitation energy of 16.11 MeV in $^{12}$C, and the breakup of the\nstate into three $\\alpha$ particles has been studied in complete kinematics. A\ntwo-step breakup model which includes interference effects is found to provide\nthe most accurate description of the experimental data. The branching ratio to\nthe ground state of $^8$Be is determined to be 5.1(5)% in agreement with\nprevious findings, but more precise by a factor of two, while the decay to the\nfirst-excited state in $^8$Be is found to be dominated by $d$-wave emission.\n", "  Large mass splittings between new scalars in two-Higgs-doublet models (2HDM)\nopen a key avenue to search for these new states via exotic heavy Higgs decays.\nWe discuss in detail the different search channels for these new scalars at the\nLHC in the presence of a sizable mass splitting, i.e. a hierarchical 2HDM\nscenario, taking into account the theoretical and experimental constraints. We\nprovide benchmark planes to exploit the complementarity among these searches,\nanalyzing their potential to probe the hierarchical 2HDM parameter space during\nLHC Run 2.\n", "  The particles produced at a potential Future Circular Collider with\n$\\sqrt{s}$ = 100 TeV are of unprecented energies. In this document we present\nthe hadronic shower containment and resolution parametrizations based on Geant4\nsimulations for the Hadronic calorimetry needed for conceptual detector design\nat this energy. The Geant4 toolkit along with FTFP\\_BERT physics list are used\nin this study. Comparisons are made with test-beam data from the ATLAS Tile\nhadronic calorimeter. These simulations motivate a 12 $\\lambda$ calorimeter in\norder to contain at 98% level TeV single hadron showers and multi-TeV jets and\nkeep a pion energy resolution constant term of 3%.\n", "  The 750 GeV resonance observed by ATLAS and CMS may be explained by a gauge\nsinglet scalar. This would provide an ideal candidate for a gauge singlet\nscalar alternative to Higgs Inflation, S-inflation. Here we discuss the\nrelevant results of S-inflation in the context of the 750 GeV resonance. In\nparticular, we show that a singlet scalar, if it is real, has a major advantage\nover the Higgs boson with regard to unitarity violation during inflation. This\nis because it is possible to restrict the large non-minimal coupling required\nfor inflation, $\\xi \\sim 10^5$, to the real singlet scalar, with all other\nscalars having $\\xi \\sim 1$. In this case the scale of unitarity violation\n$\\Lambda$ is much larger than the inflaton field during inflation. This\nprotects the inflaton effective potential from modification by the new physics\nor strong coupling which is necessary to restore unitarity, which would\notherwise invalidate the perturbative effective potential based on Standard\nModel physics. This is in contrast to the case of Higgs Inflation or models\nbased on complex singlet scalars, where the unitarity violation scale during\ninflation is less than or of the order of the inflaton field. Therefore if the\n750 GeV resonance is the inflaton, it must be a non-minimally coupled real\nsinglet scalar.\n", "  We present exact large N calculus of four point function in general\nChern-Simons bosonic and fermionic vector models. Applying the LSZ formula to\nthe four point function we determine two body scattering amplitudes in these\ntheories taking a special care for a non-analytic term to achieve unitarity in\nthe singlet channel. We show that the S-matrix enjoys the bosonization duality,\nunusual crossing relation and non-relativistic reduction to Aharonov-Bohm\nscattering. We also argue that the S-matrix develops a pole in a certain range\nof coupling constants, which disappears in the range where the theory reduces\nto Chern-Simons theory interacting with free fermions.\n", "  We apply a coupled-channel formalism incorporating quasi-bound quark-model\nstates to calculate pion scattering into eta N, K Lambda and K Sigma channels,\nas well eta p, eta n, K+Lambda, and K0Sigma+ photo-production processes. The\nmeson-baryon and photon-baryon vertices are determined in a SU(3) version of\nthe Cloudy Bag Model. Our model predicts sizable amplitudes in the P11, P13,\nP33 and S11 partial waves in agreement with the latest MAID isobar model and\nthe recent partial-wave analyses of the Bonn-Gatchina group. We are able to\ngive a quark-model explanation for the apparent resonance at 1685 MeV in the\neta n channel.\n", "  The uncertainties in neutron star (NS) radii and crust properties due to our\nlimited knowledge of the equation of state (EOS) are quantitatively analysed.\nWe first demonstrate the importance of a unified microscopic description for\nthe different baryonic densities of the star. If the pressure functional is\nobtained matching a crust and a core EOS based on models with different\nproperties at nuclear matter saturation, the uncertainties can be as large as\n$\\sim 30\\%$ for the crust thickness and $4\\%$ for the radius. Necessary\nconditions for causal and thermodynamically consistent matchings between the\ncore and the crust are formulated and their consequences examined. A large set\nof unified EOS for purely nucleonic matter is obtained based on 24 Skyrme\ninteractions and 9 relativistic mean-field nuclear parametrizations. In\naddition, for relativistic models 17 EOS including a transition to hyperonic\nmatter at high density are presented. All these EOS have in common the property\nof describing a $2\\;M_\\odot$ star and of being causal within stable NS. A span\nof $\\sim 3$ km and $\\sim 4$ km is obtained for the radius of, respectively,\n$1.0\\;M_\\odot$ and $2.0\\;M_\\odot$ star. Applying a set of nine further\nconstraints from experiment and ab-initio calculations the uncertainty is\nreduced to $\\sim 1$ km and $2$ km, respectively. These residual uncertainties\nreflect lack of constraints at large densities and insufficient information on\nthe density dependence of the EOS near the nuclear matter saturation point. The\nmost important parameter to be constrained is shown to be the symmetry energy\nslope $L$ which exhibits a linear correlation with the stellar radius,\nparticularly for masses $\\sim 1.0\\;M_\\odot$. Potential constraints on $L$, the\nNS radius and the EOS from observations of thermal states of NS are also\ndiscussed. [Abriged]\n", "  The entropy of a classical thermally isolated Hamiltonian system is given by\nthe logarithm of the measure of phase space enclosed by the constant energy\nhyper-surface, also known as volume entropy. It has been shown that on average\nthe latter cannot decrease if the initial state is sampled from a classical\npassive distribution. Quantum extension of this result has been shown, but only\nfor systems with a non-degenerate energy spectrum. Here we further extend to\nthe case of possible degeneracies.\n", "  Model analysis provides a mechanism for representing student learning as\nmeasured by standard multiple-choice surveys. The model plot contains\ninformation regarding both how likely students in a particular class are to\nchoose the correct answer and how likely they are to choose an answer\nconsistent with a well-documented conceptual model. Unfortunately Bao's\noriginal presentation of the model plot did not include a way to represent\nuncertainty in these measurements. I present details of a method to add error\nbars to model plots by expanding the work of Sommer and Lindell. I also provide\na template for generating model plots with error bars.\n", "  The tunnel ionization of an electron bounded by two delta potentials under\nthe influence of a constant electric field is considered. The equations for the\nelectron current density for two different initial states are obtained. The\ndependence of the emission current on the orientation of the potential with\nrespect to the field direction and the distance between them is studied.\nAppropriate conditions for observation essential interference effects are\ndefined.\n", "  Non-reciprocal devices, such as circulators and isolators, are indispensable\ncomponents in classical and quantum information processing in an integrated\nphotonic circuit. Aside from those applications, the non-reciprocal phase shift\nis of fundamental interest for exploring exotic topological photonics, such as\nthe realization of chiral edge states and topological protection. However,\nincorporating low optical-loss magnetic materials into a photonic chip is\ntechnically challenging. In this study, we experimentally demonstrate\nnon-magnetic non-reciprocity using optomechanical interactions in a\nwhispering-gallery microresonator, as proposed by Hafezi and Rabl.\nOptomechanically induced non-reciprocal transparency and amplification are\nobserved, and a non-reciprocal phase shift of up to 40 degrees is demonstrated\nin this study. The results of this study represent an important step towards\nintegrated all-optical controllable isolators and circulators, as well as\nnon-reciprocal phase shifters.\n", "  A detailed comparison of HERA data at low Bjorken-$x$ and low\nfour-momentum-transfer squared, $Q^2$, with predictions based on $\\ln{Q^2}$\nevolution (DGLAP) in perturbative Quantum Chromo Dynamics suggests inadequacies\nof this framework. The standard DGLAP evolution was augmented by including an\nadditional higher-twist term in the description of the longitudinal structure\nfunction, $F_{\\rm L}$. This additional term, $F_{\\rm L}~A_{\\rm L}^{\\rm\nHT}/Q^2$, improves the description of the reduced cross sections significantly.\nThe resulting predictions for $F_{\\rm L}$ suggest that further corrections are\nrequired for $Q^2$ less than about 2 GeV$^2$.\n", "  Almost all real-world networks are subject to constant evolution, and plenty\nof evolving networks have been investigated to uncover the underlying\nmechanisms for a deeper understanding of the organization and development of\nthem. Compared with the rapid expansion of the empirical studies about\nevolution mechanisms exploration, the future links prediction methods\ncorresponding to the evolution mechanisms are deficient. Real-world information\nalways contain hints of what would happen next, which is also the case in the\nobserved evolving networks. In this paper, we firstly propose a\nstructured-dependent index to strengthen the robustness of link prediction\nmethods. Then we treat the observed links and their timestamps in evolving\nnetworks as known information. We envision evolving networks as dynamic systems\nand model the evolutionary dynamics of nodes similarity. Based on the iterative\nupdating of nodes' network position, the potential trend of evolving networks\nis uncovered, which improves the accuracy of future links prediction.\nExperiments on various real-world networks show that the proposed index\nperforms better than baseline methods and the spatial-temporal position drift\nmodel performs well in real-world evolving networks.\n", "  Upgrades at the 2.3 meter Wyoming Infrared Observatory telescope have\nprovided the capability for fully-remote operations by a single operator from\nthe University of Wyoming campus. A line-of-sight 300 Megabit/s 11 GHz radio\nlink provides high-speed internet for data transfer and remote operations that\ninclude several real-time video feeds. Uninterruptable power is ensured by a 10\nkVA battery supply for critical systems and a 55 kW autostart diesel generator\ncapable of running the entire observatory for up to a week. Construction of a\nnew four-element prime-focus corrector with fused-silica elements allows\nimaging over a 40' field-of-view with a new 4096x4096 UV-sensitive prime-focus\ncamera and filter wheel. A new telescope control system facilitates the remote\noperations model and provides 20'' rms pointing over the usable sky. Taken\ntogether, these improvements pave the way for a new generation of sky surveys\nsupporting space-based missions and flexible-cadence observations advancing\nemerging astrophysical priorities such as planet detection, quasar variability,\nand long-term time-domain campaigns.\n", "  In this paper, we consider the rational extensions of two different P T\nsymmetric complex potentials namely the asymptotically vanishing Scarf II and\nasymptotically non-vanishing Rosen-Morse II [ RM-II] potentials and obtain\nbound state eigenfunc- tions in terms of newly found exceptional Xm Jacobi\npolynomials and also some new type of orthogonal polynomials respectively. By\nconsidering the asymptotic behaviour of the exceptional polynomials, we obtain\nthe reflection and transmission amplitudes for them and discuss the various\nnovel properties of the corresponding amplitudes.\n", "  Neutrino oscillation measurements depend on a difference between the rate of\nneutrino-nucleus interactions at different neutrino energies or different\ndistances from the source. Knowledge of the neutrino energy spectrum and\nneutrino-detector interactions are crucial for these experiments. Short range\nnucleon-nucleon correlations in nuclei (SRC) affect properties of nuclei. The\nArgoNeut liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (lArTPC) observed neutrino-argon\nscattering events with two protons back-to-back in the final state (\"hammer\"\nevents) which they associated with SRC pairs. The MicroBoone lArTPC will\nmeasure far more of these events.\n  We simulate hammer events using two simple models. We use the well-known\nelectron-nucleon cross section to calculate e-argon interactions where the e-\nscatters from a proton, ejecting a pi+, and the pi+ is then absorbed on a\nmoving deuteron-like $np$ pair. We also use a model where the electron excites\na nucleon to a Delta, which then deexcites by interacting with a second\nnucleon.\n  The pion production model results in two protons very similar to those of the\nhammer events. These distributions are insensitive to the momentum of the $np$\npair that absorbed the $\\pi$. The incident neutrino energy can be reconstructed\nfrom just the outgoing lepton. The Delta process results in two protons that\nare less similar to the observed events.\n  ArgoNeut hammer events can be described by a simple pion production and\nreabsorption model. These hammer events in MicroBooNE can be used to determine\nthe incident neutrino energy but not to learn about SRC. We suggest that this\nreaction channel could be used for neutrino oscillation experiments to\ncomplement other channels with higher statistics but different systematic\nuncertainties.\n", "  We propose to study the $a_0(980)$ and the $\\Lambda(1670)$ resonances in the\n$\\Lambda^+_c \\to \\pi^+ \\eta \\Lambda$ decay via the final state interactions of\nthe $\\pi^+ \\eta$ and $\\eta \\Lambda$ pairs. The weak interaction part proceeds\nthrough the $c$ quark decay process: $c(ud) \\to (s + u + \\bar d)(ud)$, while\nthe hadronization part takes place in two different mechanisms. In the first\nmechanism, the $sud$ cluster picks up a $q\\bar{q}$ pair from the vacuum to form\nthe $\\eta\\Lambda$ meson-baryon pair while the $u\\bar{d}$ pair from the weak\ndecay hadronizes into a $\\pi^+$. In the second, the $sud$ cluster turns into a\n$\\Lambda$, while the $u\\bar{d}$ pair from the $c$ decay picks up a $q\\bar{q}$\npair and hadronizes into a meson-meson pair ($\\pi\\eta$ or $K\\bar{K}$). Because\nthe final $\\pi^+ \\eta$ and $\\eta \\Lambda$ states are in pure isospin $I = 1$\nand $I=0$ combinations, the $\\Lambda^+_c \\to \\pi^+ \\eta \\Lambda$ decay can be\nan ideal process to study the $a_0(980)$ and $\\Lambda(1670)$ resonances.\nDescribing the final state interaction in the chiral unitary approach, we find\nthat the $\\pi^+ \\eta$ and $\\eta \\Lambda$ invariant mass distributions, up to an\narbitrary normalization, show clear cusp and peak structures, which can be\nassociated with the $a_0(980)$ and $\\Lambda(1670)$ resonances, respectively.\nThe proposed mechanism can provide valuable information on the nature of these\nresonances and can in principle be test by facilities such as BEPCII.\n", "  We have investigated the motion of timelike particles along geodesic in the\nbackground of accelerating and rotating black hole spacetime. We confirmed that\nthe chaos exists in the geodesic motion of the particles by Poincar\\'e\nsections, the power spectrum, the fast Lyapunov exponent indicator and the\nbifurcation diagram. Moreover, we probe the effects of the acceleration and\nrotation parameters on the chaotic behavior of a timelike geodesic particle in\nthe black hole spacetime. Our results show that the acceleration brings richer\nphysics for the geodesic motion of particles.\n", "  I present a survey of calculations of the excited $N^*$ spectrum in lattice\nQCD. I then describe recent advances aimed at extracting the momentum-dependent\nphase shifts from lattice calculations, notably in the meson sector, and the\npotential for their application to baryons. I conclude with a discussion of\ncalculations of the electromagnetic transition form factors to excited\nnucleons, including calculations at high $Q^2$.\n", "  We present an accurate and robust numerical method to track quantized vortex\nlines in a superfluid described by the Gross-Pitaevskii equation. By utilizing\nthe pseudo-vorticity field of the associated complex scalar order parameter of\nthe superfluid, we are able to track the topological defects of the superfluid\nand reconstruct the vortex lines which correspond to zeros of the field.\nThroughout, we assume our field is periodic to allow us to make extensive use\nof the Fourier representation of the field and its derivatives in order to\nretain spectral accuracy. We present several case studies to test the precision\nof the method which include the evaluation of the curvature and torsion of a\ntorus vortex knot, and the measurement of the Kelvin wave spectrum of a vortex\nline and a vortex ring. The method we present makes no a-priori assumptions on\nthe geometry of the vortices and is therefore applicable to a wide range of\nsystems such as a superfluid in a turbulent state that is characterised by many\nvortex rings coexisting with sound waves. This allows us to track the positions\nof the vortex filaments in a dense turbulent vortex tangle and extract\nstatistical information about the distribution of the size of the vortex rings\nand the inter-vortex separations. In principle, the method can be extended to\ntrack similar topological defects arising in other physical systems.\n", "  We study the 6d N=(0,2) superconformal field theory, which describes multiple\nM5-branes, on the product space S^2 x M_4, and suggest a correspondence between\na 2d N=(0,2) half-twisted gauge theory on S^2 and a topological sigma-model on\nthe four-manifold M_4. To set up this correspondence, we determine in this\npaper the dimensional reduction of the 6d N=(0,2) theory on a two-sphere and\nderive that the four-dimensional theory is a sigma-model into the moduli space\nof solutions to Nahm's equations, or equivalently the moduli space of\nk-centered SU(2) monopoles, where k is the number of M5-branes. We proceed in\nthree steps: we reduce the 6d abelian theory to a 5d Super-Yang-Mills theory on\nI x M_4, with I an interval, then non-abelianize the 5d theory and finally\nreduce this to 4d. In the special case, when M_4 is a Hyper-Kahler manifold, we\nshow that the dimensional reduction gives rise to a topological sigma-model\nbased on tri-holomorphic maps. Deriving the theory on a general M_4 requires\nknowledge of the metric of the target space. For k=2 the target space is the\nAtiyah-Hitchin manifold and we twist the theory to obtain a topological\nsigma-model, which has both scalar fields and self-dual two-forms.\n", "  Several high energy physics and neutrino physics experiments worldwide\nrequire large-size RPCs to cover wide acceptances. The muon tracking systems in\nthe Iron calorimeter (ICAL) in the INO experiment, India and the near detector\nin DUNE at Fermilab are two such examples. A (240 cm $\\times$ 120 cm $\\times$\n0.2 cm) bakelite RPC has been built and tested at Variable Energy Cyclotron\nCentre, Kolkata, using indigenous materials procured from the local market. No\nadditional lubricant, like oil has been used on the electrode surfaces for\nsmoothening. The chamber is in operation for $>$ 365 days. We have tested the\nchamber for its long term operation. The leakage current, bulk resistivity,\nefficiency, noise rate and time resolution of the chamber have been found to be\nquite stable during the testing peroid. It showed an efficiency $>$ 95$\\%$ with\nan average time resolution of $\\sim$0.83 ns at the point of measurement at 9000\nV throughout the testing period. Details of the long term performance of the\nchamber have been discussed.\n", "  I present the calculation of the $\\pi^+\\gamma^\\star\\to\\pi^+\\pi^0$ transition\namplitude from quantum chromodynamics performed by the Hadron Spectrum\nCollaboration. The amplitude is determined for a range of values of the photon\nvirtuality and the final state energy. One observes a clear dynamical\nenhancement due to the presence of the $\\rho$ resonance. By fitting the\ntransition amplitude and analytically continuing it onto the $\\rho$-pole, the\n$\\rho\\to\\pi\\gamma^\\star$ form factor is obtained. This exploratory calculation,\nperformed using lattice quantum chromodynamics, constitutes the very first\ndetermination of an electroweak decay of a hadronic resonance directly from the\nfundamental theory of quarks and gluons. In this talk, I highlight some of the\nnecessary steps that made this calculation possible, placing emphasis on\nrecently developed formalism. Finally, I discuss the status and outlook of the\nfield for the study of $N\\gamma^\\star\\to N^\\star\\to N\\pi$ transitions.\n", "  We measure the current noise of several cryogenic cables in a pulse tube\nbased dilution refrigerator at frequencies between about 1~mHz and 50~kHz. We\nshow that vibration-induced noise can be efficiently suppressed by using\nvacuum-insulated cables between room temperature and the 2nd pulse tube stage.\nA noise peak below 4 fA at the 1.4~Hz operation frequency of the pulse tube,\nand a white noise density of 0.44 fA/\\sqrt{Hz} in the millihertz range are\nobtained.\n", "  Supermassive black holes are a key ingredient of galaxy evolution. However,\ntheir origin is still highly debated. In one of the leading formation\nscenarios, a black hole of $\\sim100$ M$_{\\odot}$ results from the collapse of\nthe inner core of a supermassive star ($\\gtrsim 10^{4-5}$ M$_{\\odot}$), created\nby the rapid accumulation ($\\gtrsim 0.1 $ M$_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$) of pristine\ngas at the centre of newly formed galaxies at $z\\sim 15$. The subsequent\nevolution is still speculative: the remaining gas in the supermassive star can\neither directly plunge into the nascent black hole, or part of it can form a\ncentral accretion disc, whose luminosity sustains a surrounding, massive, and\nnearly hydrostatic envelope (a system called a \"quasi-star\"). To address this\npoint, we consider the effect of rotation on a quasi-star, as angular momentum\nis inevitably transported towards the galactic nucleus by the accumulating gas.\nUsing a model for the internal redistribution of angular momentum that\nqualitative matches results from simulations of rotating convective stellar\nenvelopes, we show that quasi-stars with an envelope mass greater than a few\n$10^{5}$ M$_{\\odot} \\times (\\rm black~hole~mass/100 M_{\\odot})^{0.82}$ have\nhighly sub-keplerian gas motion in their core, preventing gas circularisation\noutside the black hole's horizon. Less massive quasi-stars could form but last\nfor only $\\lesssim 10^4$ years before the accretion luminosity unbinds the\nenvelope, suppressing the black hole growth. We speculate that this might\neventually lead to a dual black hole seed population: (i) massive ($>10^{4}$\nM$_{\\odot}$) seeds formed in the most massive ($> 10^{8}$ M$_{\\odot}$) and rare\nhaloes; (ii) lighter ($\\sim 10^{2}$ M$_{\\odot}$) seeds to be found in less\nmassive and therefore more common haloes.\n", "  We introduce the cross-cavity quantum Rabi model describing the interaction\nof a single two-level system with two orthogonal boson fields and propose its\nquantum simulation by two-dimensional, bichromatic, first-sideband driving of a\nsingle trapped ion. We provide an introductory survey of the model, including\nits diagonalization in the two-level system basis, numerical spectra and its\ncharacteristics in the weak, ultra strong and deep strong coupling regimes. We\nalso show that the particular case of degenerate field frequencies and balanced\ncouplings allows us to cast the model as two parity deformed oscillators in any\ngiven coupling regime.\n", "  The measurement of the time of flight of the two 511 keV gammas recorded in\ncoincidence in a PET scanner provides an effective way of reducing the random\nbackground and therefore increases the scanner sensitivity, provided that the\ncoincidence resolving time (CRT) of the gammas is sufficiently good. The best\ncommercial PET-TOF system today (based in LYSO crystals and digital SiPMs), is\nthe VEREOS of Philips, boasting a CRT of 316 ps (FWHM). In this paper we\npresent a Monte Carlo investigation of the CRT performance of a PET scanner\nexploiting the scintillating properties of liquid xenon. We find that an\nexcellent CRT of 70 ps (depending on the PDE of the sensor) can be obtained if\nthe scanner is instrumented with silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) sensitive to\nthe ultraviolet light emitted by xenon. Alternatively, a CRT of 160 ps can be\nobtained instrumenting the scanner with (much cheaper) blue-sensitive SiPMs\ncoated with a suitable wavelength shifter. These results show the excellent\ntime of flight capabilities of a PET device based in liquid xenon.\n", "  We revisit the mixed derivative extension of Ho\\v{r}ava gravity which was\ndesigned to address the naturalness problems of the standard theory in the\npresence of matter couplings. We consider the minimal theory with mixed\nderivative terms that contain two spatial and two temporal derivatives.\nIncluding all terms compatible with the (modified) scaling rules and the\nfoliation preserving diffeomorphisms, we calculate the dispersion relations of\npropagating modes. We find that the theory contains four propagating degrees of\nfreedom, as opposed to three in the standard Ho\\v{r}ava gravity. The new degree\nof freedom is another scalar graviton and it is unstable at low energies. Our\nresult brings tension to the Lorentz violation suppression mechanism that\nrelies on separation of scales.\n", "  We discuss aspects of theories with superpotentials given by Arnold's $A,D,E$\nsingularities, particularly the novelties that arise when the fields are\nmatrices. We focus on 4d ${\\cal N}=1$ variants of susy QCD, with $U(N_c)$ or\n$SU(N_c)$ gauge group, $N_f$ fundamental flavors, and adjoint matter fields $X$\nand $Y$ appearing in $W_{A,D,E}(X,Y)$ superpotentials. Many of our\nconsiderations also apply in other possible contexts for matrix-variable\n$W_{A,D,E}$. The 4d $W_{A,D,E}$ SQCD-type theories RG flow to superconformal\nfield theories, and there are proposed duals in the literature for the\n$W_{A_k}$, $W_{D_k}$, and $W_{E_7}$ cases. As we review, the\n$W_{D_\\text{even}}$ and $W_{E_7}$ duals rely on a conjectural, quantum\ntruncation of the chiral ring. We explore these issues by considering various\ndeformations of the $W_{A,D,E}$ superpotentials, and the resulting RG flows and\nIR theories. Rather than finding supporting evidence for the quantum truncation\nand $W_{D_\\text{even}}$ and $W_{E_7}$ duals, we note some challenging evidence\nto the contrary.\n", "  A novel concept for detection and spectroscopy of gamma rays, and detection\nof thermal neutrons based on codoped lanthanum fluoride nanocrystals containing\ngadolinium is presented.The trends of colloidal synthesis of the mentioned\nmaterial, LaF3 co-doped with Ce as the activator, Yb as the wavelength-shifter\nand Gd as the neutron captor, is reported. Nanocrystals of the mentioned\nmaterial were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray\ndiffraction (XRD), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), optical\nabsorption, and photoluminescence spectroscopy. Gamma detection and its\npotential spectroscopy feature have been confirmed. The neutron detection\ncapability has been confirmed by experiments performed using a 252Cf neutron\nsource.\n", "  The KdV equation models the propagation of long waves in dispersive media,\nwhile the NLS equation models the dynamics of narrow-bandwidth wave packets\nconsisting of short dispersive waves. A system that couples the two equations\nto model the interaction of long and short waves seems attractive and such a\nsystem has been studied over the last decades. We evaluate the validity of this\nsystem, discussing two main problems. First, only the system coupling the\nlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation with KdV has been derived in the literature.\nSecond, the time variables appearing in the equations are of a different order.\nIt appears that in the manuscripts that study the coupled NLS-KdV system, an\nassumption has been made that the coupled system can be derived, justifying its\nmathematical study. In fact, this is true even for the papers where the\nasymptotic derivation with the problems described above is presented. In\naddition to discussing these inconsistencies, we present some alternative\nsystems describing the interaction of long and short waves.\n", "  In this paper, we study the properties of the twist-3 distribution amplitude\n(DA) of the heavy pseudo-scalars such as $\\eta_c$, $B_c$ and $\\eta_b$. New sum\nrules for the twist-3 DA moments $\\left<\\xi^n_P\\right>_{\\rm HP}$ and\n$\\left<\\xi^n_\\sigma\\right>_{\\rm HP}$ up to sixth orders and up to dimension-six\ncondensates are deduced under the framework of the background field theory.\nBased on the sum rules for the twist-3 DA moments, we construct a new model for\nthe two twist-3 DAs of the heavy pseudo-scalar with the help of the\nBrodsky-Huang-Lepage prescription. Furthermore, we apply them to the\n$B_c\\to\\eta_c$ transition form factor ($f^{B_c\\to\\eta_c}_+(q^2)$) within the\nlight-cone sum rules approach, and the results are comparable with other\napproaches. It has been found that the twist-3 DAs $\\phi^P_{3;\\eta_c}$ and\n$\\phi^\\sigma_{3;\\eta_c}$ are important for a reliable prediction of\n$f^{B_c\\to\\eta_c}_+(q^2)$. For example, at the maximum recoil region, we have\n$f^{B_c\\to\\eta_c}_+(0) = 0.674 \\pm 0.066$, in which those two twist-3 terms\nprovide $\\sim33\\%$ and $\\sim22\\%$ contributions. Also we calculate the\nbranching ratio of the semi-leptonic decay $B_c \\to\\eta_c l\\nu$ as $Br(B_c\n\\to\\eta_c l\\nu) = \\left( 9.31^{+2.27}_{-2.01} \\right) \\times 10^{-3}$.\n", "  We modify the McLerran-Venugopalan model to include only a finite number of\nsources of color charge. We argue that Coulombic interactions between these\ncolor charges generates a source-source correlation function that properly\nincludes the effects of color charge screening, a generalization of Debye\nscreening for the Color Glass Condensate. Such a model may be useful for\ncomputing angular harmonics of flow measured in high energy hadron collisions\nfor small systems. In this paper we provide a basic formulation of the problem\non a lattice.\n", "  We study the main properties of the warm inflationary model based on Barrow's\nsolution for the scale factor of the universe. Within this framework we\ncalculate analytically the basic slow roll parameters for different versions of\nwarm inflation. We test the performance of this inflationary scenario against\nthe latest observational data and we verify that the predicted spectral index\nand the tensor-to-scalar fluctuation ratio are in excellent agreement with\nthose of {\\it Planck 2015}. Finally, we find that the current predictions are\nconsistent with those of viable inflationary models.\n", "  Upgrades to the LHCb computing infrastructure in the first long shutdown of\nthe LHC have allowed for high quality decay information to be calculated by the\nsoftware trigger making a separate offline event reconstruction unnecessary.\nFurthermore, the storage space of the triggered candidate is an order of\nmagnitude smaller than the entire raw event that would otherwise need to be\npersisted. Tesla, following the LHCb renowned physicist naming convention, is\nan application designed to process the information calculated by the trigger,\nwith the resulting output used to directly perform physics measurements.\n", "  Biosensing with ferromagnet-based magnetoresistive devices has been dominated\nby electrical detection of particle-induced changes to the devices' static\nmagnetic configuration. There are however potential advantages to be gained\nfrom using field dependent, high frequency magnetization dynamics for magnetic\nparticle detection. Here we demonstrate the use of nano-confined ferromagnetic\nresonances in periodically patterned magnetic films for the detection of\nadsorbed magnetic particles with diameters ranging from 6 nm to 4 $\\mu$m. The\nnanopatterned films contain arrays of holes which can act as preferential\nadsorption sites for small particles. Hole-localized particles act in unison to\nshift the resonant frequencies of the various modes of the patterned layer with\nshift polarities determined by the localization of each mode within the\nnanopattern's repeating unit cell. The same polarity shifts are observed for a\nlarge range of coverages, even when hole-localized particles are covered by\nquasi-continuous particle sheets. For large particles however, preferential\nadsorption no longer occurs, leading to resonance shifts with polarities which\nare independent of the mode localization. Analogous shifts are seen in\ncontinuous layers where, for small particles, the shift of the layer's\nfundamental mode is typically about 10 times less than in patterned systems and\ninduced by relatively weak fields emanating beyond the particle in the\ndirection of the static applied field. This highlights the importance of having\nconfined modes consistently positioned with respect to nearby particles.\n", "  The gauge invariance analysis of theories described in noncommutative (NC)\nspace-times can lead us to interesting results since noncommutativity is one of\nthe possible paths to investigate quantum effects in classical theories such as\ngeneral relativity, for example. This theoretical possibility has motivated us\nto analyze the gauge invariance of the NC version of the Proca model, which is\na second-class system, in Dirac's classification, since its classical\nformulation (commutative space-time) has its gauge invariance broken thanks to\nthe mass term. To obtain such gauge invariant model, we have used the gauge\nunfixing method to construct a first-class NC version of the Proca model. We\nhave also questioned if the gauge symmetries of NC theories, are affected\nnecessarily or not by the NC parameter. In this way, we have calculated its\nrespective symmetries in a standard way via Poisson brackets.\n", "  Searches for rare nuclear processes, such as neutrinoless double beta-decay\nand the interactions of WIMP dark matter, are motivating experiments with\never-decreasing levels of radioactive backgrounds. These background reductions\nare achieved using various techniques, but amongst the most important is\nminimizing radioactive contamination in the materials from which the experiment\nis constructed. To this end there have been decades of advances in material\nsourcing, manufacture and certification, during which researchers have\naccumulated many thousands of measurements of material radiopurity. Some of\nthese assays are described in publications, others are in databases, but many\nare still communicated informally. Until this work, there has been no standard\nformat for encoding assay results and no effective, central location for\nstoring them. The aim of this work is to address these long-standing problems\nby creating a concise and flexible material assay data format and powerful\nsoftware application to manipulate it. A public installation of this software,\navailable at http://www.radiopurity.org, is the largest database of assay\nresults ever compiled and is intended as a long-term repository for the\ncommunity's data.\n", "  We present the star formation history of the extremely metal-poor dwarf\ngalaxy DDO 68, based on our photometry with the Advanced Camera for Surveys.\nWith a metallicity of only $12+\\log(O/H)=7.15$ and a very isolated location,\nDDO 68 is one of the most metal-poor galaxies known. It has been argued that\nDDO 68 is a young system that started forming stars only $\\sim 0.15$ Gyr ago.\nOur data provide a deep and uncontaminated optical color-magnitude diagram that\nallows us to disprove this hypothesis, since we find a population of at least\n$\\sim 1$ Gyr old stars. The star formation activity has been fairly continuous\nover all the look-back time. The current rate is quite low, and the highest\nactivity occurred between 10 and 100 Myr ago. The average star formation rate\nover the whole Hubble time is $\\simeq 0.01$ M$_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$,\ncorresponding to a total astrated mass of $\\simeq 1.3 \\times 10^8$ M$_{\\odot}$.\nOur photometry allows us to infer the distance from the tip of the red giant\nbranch, $D = 12.08 \\pm 0.67$ Mpc; however, to let our synthetic color-magnitude\ndiagram reproduce the observed ones we need a slightly higher distance,\n$D=12.65$ Mpc, or $(m-M)_0 = 30.51$, still inside the errors of the previous\ndetermination, and we adopt the latter. DDO 68 shows a very interesting and\ncomplex history, with its quite disturbed shape and a long Tail probably due to\ntidal interactions. The star formation history of the Tail differs from that of\nthe main body mainly for an enhanced activity at recent epochs, likely\ntriggered by the interaction.\n", "  This topical review focusses on the contributions of plasma physics to chaos\nand nonlinear dynamics bringing new methods which are or can be used in other\nscientific domains. It starts with the development of the theory of Hamiltonian\nchaos, and then deals with order or quasi order, for instance adiabatic and\nsoliton theories. It ends with a shorter account of dissipative and high\ndimensional Hamiltonian dynamics, and of quantum chaos. Most of these\ncontributions are a spin-off of the research on thermonuclear fusion by\nmagnetic confinement, which started in the fifties. Their presentation is both\nexhaustive and compact. [15 April 2016]\n", "  Using a semi-classical model, we investigate frustrated double ionization\n(FDI) in $\\mathrm{D_3^+}$, a two-electron triatomic molecule, when driven by an\nintense, linearly polarized, near-infrared (800 nm) laser field. We compute the\nkinetic energy release of the nuclei and find a good agreement between\nexperiment and our model. We explore the two pathways of FDI and show that,\nwith increasing field strength, over-the-barrier ionization overtakes tunnel\nionization as the underlying mechanism of FDI. Moreover, we compute the angular\ndistribution of the ion fragments for FDI and identify a feature that can\npotentially be observed experimentally and is a signature of only one of the\ntwo pathways of FDI.\n", "  Powerful femtosecond laser pulses that propagate through narrow ablating\ncapillaries cause modification of capillary walls, which is studied\nexperimentally and theoretically. At low intensities, laser-induced periodic\nsurface structures (LIPSS) and porous coating composed of sub-micron particles\nappear on the walls. At higher intensities, the surface is covered by deposited\ndroplets of the size up to 10 $\\mu$m. In both cases, the ablated material forms\na solid plug that completely blocks the capillary after several hundreds or\nthousands of pulses. The suggested theoretical model indicates that plug\nformation is a universal effect. It must take place in any narrow tube subject\nto ablation under the action of short laser pulses.\n", "  We present a proposal of a set-up to measure the work distribution due to an\narbitrary unitary process acting on the spatial transverse degrees of freedom\nof a light beam. Hermite-Gaussian optical modes representing a quantum harmonic\noscillator are prepared in a thermal state and sent through an interferometer.\nWe show that the Fourier transform of the work distribution, or the\ncharacteristic function, can be obtained by measuring the intensity at the\noutput of the interferometer. The usefulness of the approach is illustrated by\ncalculating the work distribution for a unitary operation that displaces the\nlinear momentum of the oscillator. We discuss the feasibility of the\nexperiment, which can be realized with simple linear optical components.\n", "  Using finite element micromagnetic simulations, we study how resonant\nmagnetisation dynamics in thin magnetic discs with perpendicular anisotropy are\ninfluenced by magnetostatic coupling to a magnetic nanoparticle. We identify\nresonant modes within the disc using direct magnetic eigenmode calculations and\nstudy how their frequencies and profiles are changed by the nanoparticle's\nstray magnetic field. We demonstrate that particles can generate shifts in the\nresonant frequency of the disc's fundamental mode which exceed resonance\nlinewidths in recently studied spin torque oscillator devices. Importantly, it\nis shown that the simulated shifts can be maintained over large field ranges\n(here up to 1T). This is because the resonant dynamics (the basis of\nnanoparticle detection here) respond directly to the nanoparticle stray field,\ni.e. detection does not rely on nanoparticle-induced changes to the magnetic\nground state of the disk. A consequence of this is that in the case of small\ndisc-particle separations, sensitivities to the particle are highly mode- and\nparticle-position-dependent, with frequency shifts being maximised when the\nintense stray field localised directly beneath the particle can act on a large\nproportion of the disc's spins that are undergoing high amplitude precession.\n", "  We present a model which describes proton scattering data from ISR to\nTevatron energies, and which can be applied to collimation n high energy\naccelerators, such as the LHC and FCC. Collimators remove beam halo particles,\nso that they do not impinge on vulnerable regions of the machine, such as the\nsuperconducting magnets and the experimental areas. In simulating the effect of\nthe collimator jaws it is crucial to model the scattering of protons at small\nmomentum transfer~$t$,as these protons can subsequently survive several turns\nof the ring before being lost. At high energies these soft processes are well\ndescribed by Pomeron exchange models. We study the behaviour of elastic and\nsingle-diffractive dissociation cross sections over a wide range of energy, and\nshow that the model can be used as a global description of the wide variety of\nhigh energy elastic and diffractive data presently available. In particular it\nmodels low mass diffraction dissociation, where a rich resonance structure is\npresent, and thus predicts the differential and integrated cross sections in\nthe kinematical range appropriate to the LHC.We incorporate the physics of this\nmodel into the beam tracking code MERLIN and use it to simulate the resulting\nloss maps of the beam halo lost in the collimators in the LHC.\n", "  Decretion (or external) disks are gas disks freely expanding to large radii\ndue to their internal stresses. They are expected to naturally arise in tidal\ndisruption events, around Be stars, in mass-losing post main sequence binaries,\nas a result of supernova fallback, etc. Their evolution is theoretically\nunderstood in two regimes: when the central object does not exert torque on the\ndisk (a standard assumption for conventional accretion disks) or when no mass\ninflow (or outflow) occurs at the disk center. However, many astrophysical\nobjects - circumbinary disks, Be stars, neutron stars accreting in a propeller\nregime, etc. - feature non-zero torque simultaneously with the non-zero\naccretion (or ejection of mass) at the disk center. We provide a general\ndescription for the evolution of such disks (both linear and non-linear) in the\nself-similar regime, to which the disk should asymptotically converge with\ntime. We identify a similarity parameter $\\lambda$, which is uniquely related\nto the degree, to which the central mass accretion is suppressed by the\nnon-zero central torque. The known decretion disk solutions correspond to the\ntwo discrete values of $\\lambda$, while our new solutions cover a continuum of\nits physically allowed values, corresponding to either accretion or mass\nejection by the central object. A direct relationship between $\\lambda$ and\ncentral $\\dot M$ and torque is also established. We describe the time evolution\nof the various disk characteristics for different $\\lambda$, and show that the\nobservable properties (spectrum and luminosity evolution) of the decretion\ndisks are in general different from the standard accretion disks with no\ncentral torque.\n", "  We consider self-avoiding polygons in a restricted geometry, namely an\ninfinite $L\\times M$ tube in $\\mathbb Z^3$. These polygons are subjected to a\nforce $f$, parallel to the infinite axis of the tube. When $f>0$ the force\nstretches the polygons, while when $f<0$ the force is compressive. We obtain\nand prove the asymptotic form of the free energy in both limits\n$f\\to\\pm\\infty$. We conjecture that the $f\\to-\\infty$ asymptote is the same as\nthe limiting free energy of \"Hamiltonian\" polygons, polygons which visit every\nvertex in a $L\\times M\\times N$ box. We investigate such polygons, and in\nparticular use a transfer-matrix methodology to establish that the conjecture\nis true for some small tube sizes\n", "  We present cosmological constraints from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) using a\ncombined analysis of angular clustering of red galaxies and their\ncross-correlation with weak gravitational lensing of background galaxies. We\nuse a 139 square degree contiguous patch of DES data from the Science\nVerification (SV) period of observations. Using large scale measurements, we\nconstrain the matter density of the Universe as Omega_m = 0.31 +/- 0.09 and the\nclustering amplitude of the matter power spectrum as sigma_8 = 0.74 +/- 0.13\nafter marginalizing over seven nuisance parameters and three additional\ncosmological parameters. This translates into S_8 = sigma_8(Omega_m/0.3)^{0.16}\n= 0.74 +/- 0.12 for our fiducial lens redshift bin at 0.35 <z< 0.5, while S_8 =\n0.78 +/- 0.09 using two bins over the range 0.2 <z< 0.5. We study the\nrobustness of the results under changes in the data vectors, modelling and\nsystematics treatment, including photometric redshift and shear calibration\nuncertainties, and find consistency in the derived cosmological parameters. We\nshow that our results are consistent with previous cosmological analyses from\nDES and other data sets and conclude with a joint analysis of DES angular\nclustering and galaxy-galaxy lensing with Planck CMB data, Baryon Accoustic\nOscillations and Supernova type Ia measurements.\n", "  We analyze the interaction of a cold fast electron beam with a thermalized\nplasma, in the presence of many Langmuir modes. The work aims at characterizing\nthe deviation of the system behavior from the single mode approximation, both\nwith respect to a consistent spectral analysis of the most unstable mode\nharmonics and with respect to the presence of a dense spectrum, containing\nlinearly unstable and stable modes. We demonstrate how, on the one hand, the\ntotal energy fraction absorbed by the harmonics is negligible at all (by\nevaluating its total amount) and, on the other hand, the additional Langmuir\nmodes can be excited via an avalanche mechanism, responsible for a transport in\nthe particle velocity space. In particular, we show that the spectral\nbroadening outlines a universal shape and the distribution function, associated\nto the avalanche mechanism, has an asymptotic plateau, differently from the\ncoherent structures characterizing the single wave model.\n", "  In this work we study a one-dimensional lattice of Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick\nmodels with alternating couplings between nearest-neighbors sites, which\nresembles the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. Typical properties of the underlying\nmodels are present in our semiclassical-topological hybrid system, allowing us\nto investigate an interplay between semiclassical bifurcations at mean-field\nlevel and topological phases. Our results show that bifurcations of the energy\nlandscape lead to diverse ordered quantum phases. Furthermore, the study of the\nquantum fluctuations around the mean field solution reveals the existence of\nnontrivial topological phases. These are characterized by the emergence of\nlocalized states at the edges of a chain with open boundary conditions.\n", "  We present an analysis of archival {\\it HST/ACS} imaging in the F475W\n($g_{475}$), F606W ($V_{606}$) and F814W ($I_{814}$) bands of the globular\ncluster (GC) system of a large (3.4 kpc effective radius) ultra-diffuse galaxy\n(DF17) believed located in the Coma Cluster of galaxies. We detect 11 GCs down\nto the 5$\\sigma$ completeness limit of the imaging ($I_{814}=$27 mag).\nCorrecting for background and our detection limits yields a total population of\nGCs in this galaxy of $27\\pm5$ and a $V$-band specific frequency, $S_N=28\\pm5$.\nBased on comparisons to the GC systems of Local galaxies, we show that both the\nabsolute number and the colors of the GC system of DF17 are consistent with the\nGC system of a dark-matter dominated dwarf galaxy with virial mass\n$\\sim0.9\\times10^{10}$~\\msun and a dark-to-stellar mass ratio, $M_{vir} / M_{\nstar}\\sim 1000$. Based on the stellar mass-growth of the Milky Way, we show\nthat DF17 cannot be understood as a failed Milky Way-like system, but is more\nsimilar to quenched Large Magellanic Cloud-like systems. We find that the mean\ncolor of GC population, $g_{475}-I_{814}$ = $0.91\\pm0.05$ mag, coincides with\nthe peak of the color distribution of intracluster GCs and are also similar to\nthose of the blue GCs in the outer regions of massive galaxies. We suggest that\nboth the intracluster GC population in Coma and the blue-peak in the GC\npopulations of massive galaxies may be fed - at least in part - by the\ndisrupted equivalents of systems such as DF17.\n", "  Neutral atoms can strongly influence the intrinsic rotation and radial\nelectric field at the tokamak edge. Here, we present a framework to investigate\nthese effects when the neutrals dominate the momentum transport. We explore the\nparameter space numerically, using highly flexible model geometries and a state\nof the art kinetic solver. We find that the most important parameters\ncontrolling the toroidal rotation and electric field are the major radius where\nthe neutrals are localized and the plasma collisionality. This offers a means\nto influence the rotation and electric field by, for example, varying the\nradial position of the X-point to change the major radius of the neutral peak.\n", "  Given the first 20-100 coefficients of a typical generating function of the\ntype that arises in many problems of statistical mechanics or enumerative\ncombinatorics, we show that the method of differential approximants performs\nsurprisingly well in predicting (approximately) subsequent coefficients. These\ncan then be used by the ratio method to obtain improved estimates of critical\nparameters. In favourable cases, given only the first 20 coefficients, the next\n100 coefficients are predicted with useful accuracy. More surprisingly, this is\nalso the case when the method of differential approximants does not do a useful\njob in estimating the critical parameters, such as those cases in which one has\nstretched exponential asymptotic behaviour. Nevertheless, the coefficients are\npredicted with surprising accuracy. As one consequence, significant computer\ntime can be saved in enumeration problems where several runs would normally be\nmade, modulo different primes, and the coefficients constructed from their\nvalues modulo different primes. Another is in the checking of newly calculated\ncoefficients. We believe that this concept of approximate series extension\nopens up a whole new chapter in the method of series analysis.\n", "  In the functional renormalisation group approach to gauge theory, the\nWard-Takahashi identity is modified due to the presence of an infrared cutoff\nterm. It take the most accessible form for the Wilsonian effective action.\n  In the present work we solve these identities, partially, for the Wilson\neffective action of QED. In particular, we compute the longitudinal part of the\nphoton two point vertex function as a momentum- dependent function in the\npresence of the cutoff k. The resultant Wilsonian effective action carries form\nfactors that originate from the modified Ward-Takahashi identity. We show how\nthis result carries over to the one-particle-irreducible effective action.\n", "  We present the calculation of the master integrals needed for the two-loop\nQCDxEW corrections to $ q + \\bar{q} \\to l^- + l^+$ and $ q + \\bar{q}' \\to l^- +\n\\overline{\\nu} \\, , $ for massless external particles. We treat W and Z bosons\nas degenerate in mass. We identify three types of diagrams, according to the\npresence of massive internal lines: the no-mass type, the one-mass type, and\nthe two-mass type, where all massive propagators, when occurring, contain the\nsame mass value. We find a basis of 49 master integrals and evaluate them with\nthe method of the differential equations. The Magnus exponential is employed to\nchoose a set of master integrals that obeys a canonical system of differential\nequations. Boundary conditions are found either by matching the solutions onto\nsimpler integrals in special kinematic configurations, or by requiring the\nregularity of the solution at pseudo-thresholds. The canonical master integrals\nare finally given as Taylor series around d=4 space-time dimensions, up to\norder four, with coefficients given in terms of iterated integrals,\nrespectively up to weight four.\n", "  Recent interest in point and line node semimetals has led to the proposal and\ndiscovery of these phenomena in numerous systems. Frequently, though, these\nnodal systems are described in terms of individual properties reliant on\nspecific space group intricacies or band-tuning conditions. Restricting\nourselves to cases with strong spin-orbit interaction, we develop a general\nframework which captures existing systems and predicts new examples of nodal\nmaterials. In many previously proposed systems, the three-dimensional nature of\nthe space group has obscured key generalities. Therefore, we show how within\nour framework one can predict and characterize a diverse set of nodal phenomena\neven in two-dimensional systems constructed of three-dimensional sites, known\nas the \"Layer Groups\". Expanding on an existing discussion by Watanabe, Po,\nVishwanath, and Zaletel of the relationship between minimal insulating filling,\nnonsymmorphic symmetries, and compact flat manifolds, we characterize the\nallowed semimetallic structures in the layer groups and draw connections to\nrelated three-dimensional systems.\n", "  Context. The APOGEE survey has obtained high-resolution infrared spectra of\nmore than 100,000 stars. Deriving chemical abundances patterns of these stars\nis paramount to piecing together the structure of the Milky Way. While the\nderived chemical abundances have been shown to be precise for most stars, some\ncalibration problems have been reported, in particular for more metal- poor\nstars. Aims. In this paper, we aim to (1) re-determine the chemical abundances\nof the APOGEE+Kepler stellar sample (APOKASC) with an independent procedure,\nline list and line selection, and high quality surface gravity information from\nastroseismology, and (2) extend the abundance catalogue by including abundances\nthat are not currently reported in the most recent APOGEE release (DR12).\nMethods. We fixed the Teff and log g to those determined using\nspectrophotometric and asteroseismic techniques, respectively. We made use of\nthe Brussels Automatic Stellar Parameter (BACCHUS) code to derive the\nmetallicity and broadening parameters for the APOKASC sample. In addition, we\nderived differential abundances with respect to Arcturus. Results. We have\nvalidated the BACCHUS code on APOGEE data using several well-known stars, and\nstars from open and globular clusters. We also provide the abundances of C, N,\nO, Mg, Ca, Si, Ti, S, Al, Na, Ni, Mn, Fe, K, P, Cr, Co, Cu, Rb, Yb and V for\nevery star, line, and show the impact of line selection on the final\nabundances. These include abundances of five new elements and improved\nabundances for Si, Ti, S, and V. Conclusions. In this paper, we present an\nindependent analysis of the APOKASC sample and provide abundances of up to 21\nelements. This catalogue can be used not only to study chemical abundance\npatterns of the Galaxy but also to train data driven spectral approaches which\ncan improve the abundance precision in a restricted dataset, but also full\nAPOGEE sample.\n", "  We show that inflation can naturally occur at a finite temperature T>H that\nis sustained by dissipative effects, when the inflaton field corresponds to a\npseudo Nambu-Goldstone boson of a broken gauge symmetry. Similarly to \"Little\nHiggs\" scenarios for electroweak symmetry breaking, the flatness of the\ninflaton potential is protected against both quadratic divergences and the\nleading thermal corrections. We show that, nevertheless, nonlocal dissipative\neffects are naturally present and are able to sustain a nearly thermal bath of\nlight particles despite the accelerated expansion of the Universe. As an\nexample, we discuss the dynamics of chaotic warm inflation with a quartic\npotential and show that the associated observational predictions are in very\ngood agreement with the latest Planck results. This model constitutes the first\nrealization of warm inflation requiring only a small number of fields; in\nparticular, the inflaton is directly coupled to just two light fields.\n", "  The classical conformality is one of the possible candidates for explaining\nthe gauge hierarchy of the Standard Model. We show that it is naturally\nobtained from the Coleman's theory on baby universe.\n", "  We analyze the spectrum of perturbative closed strings on AdS3 x S3 x T4 with\nRamond-Ramond flux using integrable methods. By solving the crossing equations\nwe determine the massless and mixed-mass dressing factors of the worldsheet S\nmatrix and derive the Bethe equations. Using these, we construct the underlying\nintegrable spin chain and show that it reproduces the reducible spin chain\nconjectured at weak coupling in arXiv:1211.1952. We find that the string-theory\nmassless modes are described by gapless excitations of the spin chain. The\nresulting degeneracy of vacua matches precisely the protected supergravity\nspectrum found by de Boer.\n", "  Through experiments, we studied defect turbulence, a type of spatiotemporal\nchaos in planar systems of nematic liquid crystals, to clarify the chaotic\nadvection of weak turbulence. In planar systems of large aspect ratio,\nstructural relaxation which is characterized by the dynamic structure factor\nexhibits a long-period oscillation that is described well by a combination of a\nsimple exponential relaxation and underdamped oscillation. The simple\nrelaxation arises as a result of the roll modulation while the damped\noscillation is manifest in the repetitive gliding of defect pairs in a local\narea. Each relaxation is derived analytically by the projection operator method\nthat separates turbulent transport into a macroscopic contribution and\nfluctuations. The analysis proposes that the two relaxations are not\ncorrelated. The nonthermal fluctuations of defect turbulence are consequently\nseparated into two independent Markov processes. Our approach sheds light on\ndiversity and universality from a unified viewpoint for weak turbulence.\n", "  We consider BPS Wilson loops in planar ABJM theory, wound multiple times\naround the great circle. We compute the expectation value of the 1/6-BPS and\n1/2-BPS Wilson loops to three- and two-loop order in perturbation theory,\nrespectively, dealing with the combinatorics of multiple winding via recursive\nrelations. For the 1/6-BPS Wilson loop we perform the computation at generic\nframing and at framing 1 we find agreement with the localization result. For\nthe 1/2-BPS Wilson loop we compute the expectation value at trivial framing and\nby comparison with the matrix model expression we extract the framing\ndependence of the fermion diagrams.\n", "  The LIGO observation of gravitational waves from a binary black hole merger\nhas begun a new era in fundamental physics. If new dark sector particles, be\nthey bosons or fermions, can coalesce into exotic compact objects (ECOs) of\nastronomical size, then the first evidence for such objects, and their\nunderlying microphysical description, may arise in gravitational wave\nobservations. In this work we study how the macroscopic properties of ECOs are\nrelated to their microscopic properties, such as dark particle mass and\ncouplings. We then demonstrate the smoking gun exotic signatures that would\nprovide observational evidence for ECOs, and hence new particles, in\nterrestrial gravitational wave observatories. Finally, we discuss how\ngravitational waves can test a core concept in general relativity: Hawking's\narea theorem.\n", "  The coherent transport of $n$ fermions in disordered networks of $l$\nsingle-particle states connected by $k$-body interactions is studied. These\nnetworks are modeled by embedded Gaussian random matrix ensemble (EGE). The\nconductance bandwidth as well as the ensemble-averaged total current attain\ntheir maximal values if the system is highly filled $n \\sim l-1$ and $k\\sim\nn/2$. For the cases $k=1$ and $k=n$ the bandwidth is minimal. We show that for\nall parameters the transport is enhanced significantly whenever centrosymmetric\nensemble (csEGE) are considered. In this case the transmission shows numerous\nresonances of perfect transport. Analyzing the transmission by spectral\ndecomposition, we find that centrosymmetry induces strong correlations and\nenhances the extrema of the distributions. This suppresses destructive\ninterference effects in the system and thus, causes backscattering-free\ntransmission resonances which enhance the overall transport. The distribution\nof the total current for the csEGE has a very large dominating peak for\n$n=l-1$, close to the highest observed currents.\n", "  The CHemical Abundances of Spirals (CHAOS) project leverages the combined\npower of the Large Binocular Telescope with the broad spectral range and\nsensitivity of the Multi Object Double Spectrograph (MODS) to measure direct\nabundances in large samples of HII regions in spiral galaxies. We present LBT\nMODS observations of 109 Hii regions in NGC5457, of which 74 have robust\nmeasurements of key auroral lines, a factor of 3 larger than all previous\npublished detections of auroral lines in the HII regions of NGC5457. Comparing\nthe temperatures derived from the different ionic species we find: (1) strong\ncorrelations of T[NII] with T[SIII] and T[OIII], consistent with little or no\nintrinsic scatter; (2) a correlation of T[SIII] with T[OIII], but with\nsignificant intrinsic dispersion; (3) overall agreement between T[NII], T[SII],\nand T[OII], as expected, but with significant outliers; (4) the correlations of\nT[NII] with T[SIII] and T[OIII] match the predictions of photoionization\nmodeling while the correlation of T[SIII] with T[OIII] is offset from the\nprediction of photoionization modeling. Based on these observations, which\ninclude significantly more observations of lower excitation HII regions,\nmissing in many analyses, we inspect the commonly used ionization correction\nfactors (ICFs) for unobserved ionic species and propose new empirical ICFs for\nS and Ar. We have discovered an unexpected population of HII regions with a\nsignificant offset to low values in Ne/O, which defies explanation. We derive\nradial gradients in O/H and N/O which agree with previous studies. Our large\nobservational database allows us to examine the dispersion in abundances, and\nwe find intrinsic dispersions of 0.074 in O/H and 0.095 in N/O (at a given\nradius). We stress that this measurement of the intrinsic dispersion comes\nexclusively from direct measurements of HII regions in NGC5457.\n", "  Motivated by the rapid development of heavy-flavor experiments,\nphenomenological studies of nonleptonic $\\bar{B}_{d,s} \\to D^{*}_{d,s} V$ and\n$\\bar{B}_{d,s}^* \\to D_{d,s} V$~($V=\\rho\\,,K^*$) decays are performed within\nthe framework of QCD Factorization. Relative to previous works, the QCD\ncorrections to the transverse amplitudes are evaluated at next-to-leading\norder. The theoretical predictions of the observables are updated. For the\nmeasured $\\bar{B}_{d,s} \\to D^{*}_{d,s} V$ decays, two tensions between\ntheoretical results and experimental measurements, {\\it i.e.} \"$R_{ds}^{V}$\npuzzle\" and \"$D^{*} V$~(or $R_{V/\\ell\\bar{\\nu}_\\ell}$) puzzle\", are presented\nafter detailed analyses. For the $\\bar{B}_{d,s}^* \\to D_{d,s} V$ decays, they\nhave relatively large branching fractions of the order $\\gtrsim{\\cal\nO}(10^{-9})$ and are in the scope of Belle-II and LHCb experiments. Moreover,\nthey also provide a way to crosscheck the above-mentioned possible puzzles\nthrough the similar ratios $R_{ds}^{\\prime V}$ and\n$R_{V/\\ell\\bar{\\nu}_\\ell}^{\\prime}$. More refined experimental measurements and\ntheoretical efforts are required to confirm or refute such two anomalies.\n", "  The dynamics of the cavitation bubble collapse is a fundamental issue for the\nbubble collapse application and prevention. In present work, the modified\nforcing scheme for the pseudopotential multi-relaxation-time lattice Boltzmann\nmodel developed by Li Q. et al. is adopted to develop a cavitation bubble\ncollapse model. In the respects of coexistence curves and Laplace law\nverification, the improved pseudopotential multi-relaxation-time lattice\nBoltzmann model is investigated. The independence between the kinematic\nviscosity and the thermodynamic consistency, surface tension is founded. By\nhomogeneous and heterogeneous cavitation simulation, the capability of the\npresent model to describe the cavitation bubble development as well as the\ncavitation inception is verified. The bubble collapse between two parallel\nwalls is simulated. The dynamic process of collapsing bubble is consistent with\nthe results from experiments and simulations by other numerical method. It is\ndemonstrated that the present pseudopotential multi-relaxation-time lattice\nBoltzmann model is available and efficient, and the lattice Boltzmann method is\nan alternative tool for collapsing bubble modeling.\n", "  Vortex core polarity switching in NiFe disks has been evidenced using an\nall-electrical rectification scheme. Both simulation and experiments yield a\nconsistent loss of the rectified signal when driving the core at high powers\nnear its gyrotropic resonant frequency. The frequency range over which the loss\noccurs grows and shifts with increasing signal power, consistent with\nnon-linear core dynamics and periodic switching of the core polarity induced by\nthe core attaining its critical velocity. We demonstrate that core polarity\nswitching can be impeded by displacing the core towards the disk's edge where\nan increased core stiffness reduces the maximum attainable core velocity.\n", "  Sudden changes are ubiquitous in nature. Identifying them is of crucial\nimportance for a number of applications in medicine, biology, geophysics, and\nsocial sciences. Here we investigate the problem in the quantum domain,\nconsidering a source that emits particles in a default state, until a point\nwhere it switches to another state. Given a sequence of particles emitted by\nthe source, the problem is to find out where the change occurred. For large\nsequences, we obtain an analytical expression for the maximum probability of\ncorrectly identifying the change point when joint measurements on the whole\nsequence are allowed. We also construct strategies that measure the particles\nindividually and provide an online answer as soon as a new particle is emitted\nby the source. We show that these strategies substantially underperform the\noptimal strategy, indicating that quantum sudden changes, although happening\nlocally, are better detected globally.\n", "  We construct a set of non-rational conformal field theories that consist of\ndeformations of Toda field theory for sl(n). Besides conformal invariance, the\ntheories still enjoy a remnant infinite-dimensional affine symmetry. The case\nn=3 is used to illustrate this phenomenon, together with further deformations\nthat yield enhanced Kac-Moody symmetry algebras. For generic n we compute\nN-point correlation functions on the Riemann sphere and show that these can be\nexpressed in terms of sl(n) Toda field theory correlation functions.\n", "  We consider \"new inflation\" inflationary models at small fields, embedded in\nminimal ${\\cal N}=1$ supergravity with a single chiral superfield. Imposing a\nperiod of inflation compatible with experiment severely restricts possible\nmodels, classified in perturbation theory. If moreover we impose that the field\ngoes to large values and very small potential at the current time, like would\nbe needed for instance for the inflaton being the volume modulus in large extra\ndimensional scenarios, the possible models are restricted to very contrived\nsuperpotentials.\n", "  Configurational entropy has been revealed as a reliable method for\nconstraining some parameters of a given model [Phys. Rev. D \\textbf{92} (2015)\n126005, Eur. Phys. J. C \\textbf{76} (2016) 100]. In this letter we calculate\nthe configurational entropy in Gauss-Bonnet braneworld models. Our results\nrestrict the range of acceptability of the Gauss-Bonnet scalar values. In this\nway, the information theoretical measure in Gauss-Bonnet scenarios opens a new\nwindow to probe situations where the additional parameters, responsible for the\nGauss-Bonnet sector, are arbitrary. We also show that such an approach is very\nimportant in applications that include p and Dp-branes and various\nsuperstring-motivated theories.\n", "  We have briefly analyzed the existence of the pseudofermionic structure of\nmultilevel pseudo-Hermitian systems with odd time-reversal and higher order\ninvolutive symmetries. We have shown that 2N-level Hamiltonians with N-order\neigenvalue degeneracy can be represented in the oscillator-like form in terms\nof pseudofermionic creation and annihilation operators for both real and\ncomplex eigenvalues. The example of most general four-level traceless\nHamiltonian with odd time-reversal symmetry, which is an extension of the SO(5)\nHermitian Hamiltonian, is considered in greater and explicit detail.\n", "  Determining the prime factors of a given number N is a problem, which\nrequires super-polynomial time for conventional digital computers. A\npolynomial-time algorithm was invented by P. Shor for quantum computers.\nHowever, the realization of quantum computers is associated with significant\ntechnological challenges in achieving and preserving quantum entanglement.\nPrime factorization can be also solved by using classical wave interference\nwithout quantum entanglement. In this work, we present experimental data\nshowing prime factorization by utilizing spin wave interference. The prime\nfactorization includes three major steps. First, general type computer\ncalculates the sequence of numbers mkmod(N), where N is the number to be\nfactorized, m is a randomly chosen positive integer, and k=0,1,2,3,4,5,6 .. .\nNext, the period of calculated sequence r is determined by exploiting spin wave\ninterference. Finally, the general type computer finds the primes based on the\nobtained r. The experiment on the period finding was accomplished on the\n6-terminal Y3Fe2(FeO4)3 device. We chose number 15 for a test and found its\nprimes in a sequence of measurements. The obtained data demonstrate an example\nof solving a prime factorization problem using classical wave interference. We\ndiscuss the physical and technological limitations of this approach, which\ndefine the maximum size of N and the computational speed. Though this classical\napproach cannot compete with the quantum algorithm in efficiency, magnonic\nholographic devices can be potentially utilized as complementary logic units\naimed to speed up prime factorization with classical computers.\n", "  We combine numerical diagonalization with a semi-analytical calculations to\nprove the existence of the intermediate non-ergodic but delocalized phase in\nthe Anderson model on disordered hierarchical lattices. We suggest a new\ngeneralized population dynamics that is able to detect the violation of\nergodicity of the delocalized states within the Abou-Chakra, Anderson and\nThouless recursive scheme. This result is supplemented by statistics of random\nwave functions extracted from exact diagonalization of the Anderson model on\nensemble of disordered Random Regular Graphs (RRG) of N sites with the\nconnectivity K=2. By extrapolation of the results of both approaches to\nN->infinity we obtain the fractal dimensions D_{1}(W) and D_{2}(W) as well as\nthe population dynamic exponent D(W) with the accuracy sufficient to claim that\nthey are non-trivial in the broad interval of disorder strength W_{E}<W<W_{c}.\nThe thorough analysis of the exact diagonalization results for RRG with\nN>10^{5} reveals a singularity in D_{1,2}(W)-dependencies which provides a\nclear evidence for the first order transition between the two delocalized\nphases on RRG at W_{E}\\approx 10.0. We discuss the implications of these\nresults for quantum and classical non-integrable and many-body systems.\n", "  Multi-gap RPC prototypes with readout on a multi-strip electrode were\ndeveloped for the small polar angle region of the CBM-TOF subdetector, the most\ndemanding zone in terms of granularity and counting rate. The prototypes are\nbased on low resistivity ($\\sim$10$^{10}$ $\\Omega$cm) glass electrodes for\nperforming in high counting rate environment. The strip width/pitch size was\nchosen such to fulfill the impedance matching with the front-end electronics\nand the granularity requirements of the innermost zone of the CBM-TOF wall. The\nin-beam tests using secondary particles produced in heavy ion collisions on a\nPb target at SIS18 - GSI Darmstadt and SPS - CERN were focused on the\nperformance of the prototype in conditions similar to the ones expected at\nSIS100/FAIR. An efficiency larger than 98\\% and a system time resolution in the\norder of 70~-~80~ps were obtained in high counting rate and high multiplicity\nenvironment.\n", "  X-ray reverberation, where light-travel time delays map out the compact\ngeometry around the inner accretion flow in supermassive black holes, has been\ndiscovered in several of the brightest, most variable and well-known Seyfert\ngalaxies. In this work, we expand the study of X-ray reverberation to all\nSeyfert galaxies in the XMM-Newton archive above a nominal rms variability and\nexposure level (a total of 43 sources). 50 per cent of source exhibit iron K\nreverberation, in that the broad iron K emission line responds to rapid\nvariability in the continuum. We also find that on long timescales, the hard\nband emission lags behind the soft band emission in 85 per cent of sources.\nThis `low-frequency hard lag' is likely associated with the coronal emission,\nand so this result suggests that most sources with X-ray variability show\nintrinsic variability from the nuclear region. We update the known iron K lag\namplitude vs. black hole mass relation, and find evidence that the height or\nextent of the coronal source (as inferred by the reverberation time delay)\nincreases with mass accretion rate.\n", "  Bulk localized excited states in an AdS spacetime can be constructed from\nIshibashi states with respect to the global conformal symmetry in the dual CFT.\nWe study boundary two point functions of primary operators in the presence of\nbulk localized excitations in two dimensional CFTs. From two point functions in\nholographic CFTs, we observe causal propagations of radiations when the mass of\ndual bulk scalar field is close to the BF bound. This behavior for holographic\nCFTs is consistent with the locality and causality in classical gravity duals.\nWe also show that this cannot be seen in free fermion CFTs. Moreover, we find\nthat the short distance behavior of two point functions is universal and obeys\nthe relation which generalizes the first law of entanglement entropy.\n", "  Large-scale hydrodynamic instabilities of periodic helical flows are\ninvestigated using $3$D Floquet numerical computations. A minimal three-modes\nanalytical model that reproduce and explains some of the full Floquet results\nis derived. The growth-rate $\\sigma$ of the most unstable modes (at small\nscale, low Reynolds number $Re$ and small wavenumber $q$) is found to scale\ndifferently in the presence or absence of anisotropic kinetic alpha (\\AKA{})\neffect. When an $AKA$ effect is present the scaling $\\sigma \\propto q\\; Re\\,$\npredicted by the $AKA$ effect theory [U. Frisch, Z. S. She, and P. L. Sulem,\nPhysica D: Nonlinear Phenomena 28, 382 (1987)] is recovered for $Re\\ll 1$ as\nexpected (with most of the energy of the unstable mode concentrated in the\nlarge scales). However, as $Re$ increases, the growth-rate is found to saturate\nand most of the energy is found at small scales. In the absence of \\AKA{}\neffect, it is found that flows can still have large-scale instabilities, but\nwith a negative eddy-viscosity scaling $\\sigma \\propto \\nu(b Re^2-1) q^2$. The\ninstability appears only above a critical value of the Reynolds number\n$Re^{c}$. For values of $Re$ above a second critical value $Re^{c}_{S}$ beyond\nwhich small-scale instabilities are present, the growth-rate becomes\nindependent of $q$ and the energy of the perturbation at large scales decreases\nwith scale separation. A simple two-modes model is derived that well describes\nthe behaviors of energy concentration and growth-rates of various unstable\nflows. In the non-linear regime (at moderate values of $Re$) and in the\npresence of scale separation, the forcing scale and the largest scales of the\nsystem are found to be the most dominant energetically.\n", "  Magnetically coupled hybrid quantum systems enable robust quantum state\ncontrol through Landau-Zener transitions. Here, we show that an ultracold\natomic sample coupled to a nanomechanical resonator via oscillating magnetic\nfields can be used to cool the resonator's mechanical motion, to measure the\nmechanical temperature, and to enable entanglement of these mesoscopic objects.\nWe calculate the expected coupling for both permanent-magnet and\ncurrent-conducting nanostring resonators and describe how this hybridization is\nattainable using recently developed fabrication techniques, including SiN\nnanostrings and atom chips.\n", "  We present observations of three FU Orionis objects (hereafter, FUors) with\nnonredundant aperture-mask interferometry (NRM) at 1.59 um and 2.12 um that\nprobe for binary companions on the scale of the protoplanetary disk that feeds\ntheir accretion outbursts. We do not identify any companions to V1515 Cyg or\nHBC 722, but we do resolve a close binary companion to V1057 Cyg that is at the\ndiffraction limit (rho = 58.3 +/- 1.4 mas or 30 +/- 5 AU) and currently much\nfainter than the outbursting star (delta(K') = 3.34 +/- 0.10 mag). Given the\nflux excess of the outbursting star, we estimate that the mass of the companion\n(M ~ 0.25 Msun) is similar to or slightly below that of the FUor itself, and\ntherefore it resembles a typical T Tauri binary system. Our observations only\nachieve contrast limits of delta(K') ~ 4 mag, and hence we are only sensitive\nto companions that were near or above the pre-outburst luminosity of the FUors.\nIt remains plausible that FUor outbursts could be tied to the presence of a\nclose binary companion. However, we argue from the system geometry and mass\nreservoir considerations that these outbursts are not directly tied to the\norbital period (i.e., occurring at periastron passage), but instead must only\noccur infrequently.\n", "  Lattice modes are intrinsic to the periodic structures and their occurrence\ncan be easily tuned and controlled by changing the lattice constant of the\nstructural array. Previous studies have revealed excitation of sharp absorption\nresonances due to lattice mode coupling with the plasmonic resonances. Here, we\nreport the first experimental observation of a lattice induced transparency\n(LIT) by coupling the first order lattice mode (FOLM) to the structural\nresonance of a metamaterial resonator at terahertz frequencies. The observed\nsharp transparency is a result of the destructive interference between the\nbright mode and the FOLM mediated dark mode. As the FOLM is swept across the\nmetamaterial resonance, the transparency band undergoes large change in its\nbandwidth and resonance position. Besides controlling the transparency\nbehaviour, LIT also shows a huge enhancement in the Q-factor and record high\ngroup delay of 28 ps, which could be pivotal in ultrasensitive sensing and slow\nlight device applications.\n", "  Single atoms or atom-like emitters are the purest source of on-demand single\nphotons, they are intrinsically incapable of multi-photon emission. To\ndemonstrate this degree of purity we have realized a tunable, on-demand source\nof single photons using a single ion trapped at the common focus of high\nnumerical aperture lenses. Our trapped-ion source produces single-photon pulses\nat a rate of 200 kHz with g$^2(0) = (1.9 \\pm 0.2) \\times 10^{-3}$, without any\nbackground subtraction. The corresponding residual background is accounted for\nexclusively by detector dark counts. We further characterize the performance of\nour source by measuring the violation of a non-Gaussian state witness and show\nthat its output corresponds to ideal attenuated single photons. Combined with\ncurrent efforts to enhance collection efficiency from single emitters, our\nresults suggest that single trapped ions are not only ideal stationary qubits\nfor quantum information processing, but promising sources of light for scalable\noptical quantum networks.\n", "  Observations relating the characteristics of electrons seen near Earth (SEPs)\nand those producing flare radiation show that in certain (prompt) events the\norigin of both population appears to be the flare site, which show strong\ncorrelation between the number and spectral index of SEP and hard X-ray\nradiating electrons, but in others(delayed), which are associated with fast\nCMEs, this relation is complex and SEPs tend to be harder. Prompt event\nspectral relation disagrees with that expected in thick or thin target models.\nWe show that using a a more accurate treatment of the transport of the\naccelerated electrons to the footpoints and to the Earth can account for this\ndiscrepancy. Our results are consistent with those found by Chen and Petrosian\n(2013) for two flares using non-parametric inversion methods, according to\nwhich we have weak diffusion conditions, and trapping mediated by magnetic\nfield convergence. The weaker correlations and harder spectra of delayed events\ncan come about by re-acceleration of electrons in the CME shock environment. We\ndescribe under what conditions such a hardening can be achieved. Using this\n(acceleration at the flare and re-acceleration in the CME) scenario we show\nthat we can describe the similar dichotomy that exists between the so called\nimpulsive, highly enriched ($^3$He and heavy ions) and softer SEP events, and\nstronger more gradual SEP events with near normal ionic abundances and harder\nspectra. These methods can be used to distinguish the acceleration mechanisms\nand to constrain their characteristics.\n", "  We present a Projector Augmented-Wave~(PAW) method based on a wavelet basis\nset. We implemented our wavelet-PAW method as a PAW library in the ABINIT\npackage [http://www.abinit.org] and into BigDFT [http://www.bigdft.org]. We\ntest our implementation in prototypical systems to illustrate the potential\nusage of our code. By using the wavelet-PAW method, we can simulate charged and\nspecial boundary condition systems with frozen-core all-electron precision.\nFurthermore, our work paves the way to large-scale and potentially order-N\nsimulations within a PAW method.\n", "  Inspired by the successful synthesis of several allotropes, boron sheets have\nbeen one of the hottest spot areas of focus in various fields. Here, we study\nphonon transport in three types of boron nanoribbons with zigzag and armchair\nedges by using a non-equilibrium Green's function combined with first\nprinciples methods. Diverse transport properties are found in the nanoribbons.\nAt the room temperature, their highest thermal conductance can be comparable\nwith that of graphene, while the lowest thermal conductance is less than half\nof graphene's. The three boron sheets exhibit different anisotropic transport\ncharacteristics. Two of these sheets have stronger phonon transport abilities\nalong the zigzag edges than the armchair edges, while in the case of the third,\nthe results are reversed. With the analysis of phonon dispersion, bonding\ncharge density, and simplified models of atomic chains, the mechanisms of the\ndiverse phonon properties are discussed. Because all boron allotropes consists\nof hexagonal and triangular rings, many hybrid patterns can be constructed\nnaturally without doping, adsorption, and defects. Our results are useful in\nmaterials and devices design using boron sheets for thermal management.\n", "  We present Q-U-I JOint TEnerife (QUIJOTE) intensity and polarisation maps at\n10-20 GHz covering a region along the Galactic plane 24<l<45 deg, |b|<8 deg.\nThese maps result from 210 h of data, have a sensitivity in polarisation of ~40\nmuK/beam and an angular resolution of ~1 deg. Our intensity data are crucial to\nconfirm the presence of anomalous microwave emission (AME) towards the two\nmolecular complexes W43 (22 sigma) and W47 (8 sigma). We also detect at high\nsignificance (6 sigma) AME associated with W44, the first clear detection of\nthis emission towards a SNR. The new QUIJOTE polarisation data, in combination\nwith WMAP, are essential to: i) Determine the spectral index of the synchrotron\nemission in W44, beta_sync =-0.62 +/-0.03, in good agreement with the value\ninferred from the intensity spectrum once a free-free component is included in\nthe fit. ii) Trace the change in the polarisation angle associated with Faraday\nrotation in the direction of W44 with rotation measure -404 +/- 49 rad/m2. And\niii) set upper limits on the polarisation of W43 of Pi_AME <0.39 per cent (95\nper cent C.L.) from QUIJOTE 17~GHz, and <0.22 per cent from WMAP 41 GHz data,\nwhich are the most stringent constraints ever obtained on the polarisation\nfraction of the AME. For typical physical conditions (grain temperature and\nmagnetic field strengths), and in the case of perfect alignment between the\ngrains and the magnetic field, the models of electric or magnetic dipole\nemissions predict higher polarisation fractions.\n", "  The 2-Higgs-Doublet Model (2HDM) belongs to the simplest extensions of the\nStandard Model (SM) Higgs sector that are in accordance with theoretical and\nexperimental constraints. In order to be able to properly investigate the\nexperimental Higgs data and, in the long term to distinguish between possible\nmodels beyond the SM, precise predictions for the Higgs boson observables have\nto be made available on the theory side. This requires the inclusion of the\nhigher order corrections. In this work, we investigate in detail the\nrenormalization of the 2HDM, a pre-requisite for the computation of higher\norder corrections. We pay particular attention to the renormalization of the\nmixing angles $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$, which diagonalize the Higgs mass matrices\nand which enter all Higgs observables. The implications of various\nrenormalization schemes in next-to-leading order corrections to the sample\nprocesses $H^\\pm \\to W^\\pm h/H$ and $H \\to ZZ$ are investigated. Based on our\nfindings, we will present a renormalization scheme that is at the same time\nprocess independent, gauge independent and numerically stable.\n", "  Strong gravitational lensing provides a geometric probe of cosmology in a\nunique manner through distance ratios involving the source and lens. This is\nwell known for the time delay distance derived from measured delays between\nlightcurves of the images of variable sources such as quasars. Recently, double\nsource plane lens systems involving two constant sources lensed by the same\nforeground lens have been proposed as another probe, involving a different\nratio of distances measured from the image positions and fairly insensitive to\nthe lens modeling. Here we demonstrate that these two different sets of strong\nlensing distance ratios have strong complementarity in cosmological leverage.\nUnlike other probes, the double source distance ratio is actually more\nsensitive to the dark energy equation of state parameters $w_0$ and $w_a$ than\nto the matter density $\\Omega_m$, for low redshift lenses. Adding double source\ndistance ratio measurements can improve the dark energy figure of merit by 40%\nfor a sample of fewer than 100 low redshift systems, or even better for the\noptimal redshift distribution we derive.\n", "  We numerically construct asymptotically global $\\mathrm{AdS}_5\\times\n\\mathrm{S}^5$ black holes that are localised on the $\\mathrm{S}^5$. These are\nsolutions to type IIB supergravity with $\\mathrm S^8$ horizon topology that\ndominate the theory in the microcanonical ensemble at small energies. At higher\nenergies, there is a first-order phase transition to\n$\\mathrm{AdS}_5$-Schwarzschild$\\times \\mathrm{S}^5$. By the AdS/CFT\ncorrespondence, this transition is dual to spontaneously breaking the $SO(6)$\nR-symmetry of $\\mathcal N=4$ super Yang-Mills down to $SO(5)$. We extrapolate\nthe location of this phase transition and compute the expectation value of the\nresulting scalar operators in the low energy phase.\n", "  In the disordered local moment picture, we calculated the magnetization (M)\nand magnetic anisotropy energy (MAE) of FePt, CoPt, and MnAl ordered alloys and\nbody-centered tegragonal FeCo (bct-FeCo) disordered alloy, assuming spatially\nfluctuated spin configurations at finite temperatures. All alloys exhibit the\nrelation K1(T)/K1(0)=(M(T)/M(0))^n with the exponent (n) around 2. This is\nconsistent with the two-ion anisotropy model, in contrast to the usual\nsingle-ion anisotropy model exhibiting n=3. Because these systems have\ndifferent mechanisms of MAE, we suggest that this relation is a general rule\nfor itinerant electron systems.\n", "  Using femtosecond time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy we\ninvestigate the effect of electron doping on the electron dynamics in\nBa(Fe_{1-x}Co_x)_2As_2 in a range of 0 < x < 0.15 at temperatures slightly\nabove the N\\'eel temperature. By analyzing the time-dependent photoemission\nintensity of the pump laser excited population as a function of energy, we\nfound that the relaxation times at 0 < E-E_F < 0.2 eV are doping dependent and\nabout 100 fs shorter at optimal doping than for overdoped and parent compounds.\nAnalysis of the relaxation rates also reveals the presence of a pump fluence\ndependent step in the relaxation time at E-E_F = 200meV which we explain by\ncoupling of the excited electronic system to a boson of this energy. We compare\nour results with static ARPES and transport measurements and find disagreement\nand agreement concerning the doping-dependence, respectively. We discuss the\neffect of the electron-boson coupling on the energy-dependent relaxation and\nassign the origin of the boson to a magnetic excitation.\n", "  By using first-principles calculations, we propose that WC-type ZrTe is a new\ntype of topological semimetal (TSM). It has six pairs of chiral Weyl nodes in\nits first Brillouin zone, but it is distinguished from other existing TSMs by\nhaving additional two paris of massless fermions with triply degenerate nodal\npoints as proposed in the isostructural compounds TaN and NbN. The mirror\nsymmetry, three-fold rotational symmetry and time-reversal symmetry require all\nof the Weyl nodes to have the same velocity vectors and locate at the same\nenergy level. The Fermi arcs on different surfaces are shown, which may be\nmeasured by future experiments. It demonstrates that the \"material universe\"\ncan support more intriguing particles simultaneously.\n", "  We consider a class of topological defects in $(1,1)$-dimensions with a\ndeformed $\\phi^4$ kink structure whose stability analysis leads to a\nSchr\\\"odinger-like equation with a zero-mode and at least one vibrational\n(shape) mode. We are interested in the dynamics of kink-antikink collisions,\nfocusing on the structure of two-bounce windows. For small deformation and for\none or two vibrational modes, the observed two-bounce windows are explained by\nthe standard mechanism of a resonant effect between the first vibrational and\nthe translational modes. With the increasing of the deformation, the effect of\nthe appearance of more than one vibrational mode is the gradual disappearance\nof the initial two-bounce windows. The total suppression of two-bounce windows\neven with the presence of a vibrational mode offers a counterexample from what\nexpected from the standard mechanism. For even larger deformation, some\ntwo-bounce windows reappear, but with a non-standard structure.\n", "  The thermodynamical properties of a generalized Dicke model are calculated\nand related with the critical properties of its energy spectrum, namely the\nquantum phase transitions (QPT) and excited state quantum phase transitions\n(ESQPT). The thermal properties are calculated both in the canonical and the\nmicrocanonical ensembles. The latter deduction allows for an explicit\ndescription of the relation between thermal and energy spectrum properties.\nWhile in an isolated system the subspaces with different pseudo spin are\ndisconnected, and the whole energy spectrum is accesible, in the thermal\nensamble the situation is radically different. The multiplicity of the lowest\nenergy states for each pseudo spin completely dominates the thermal behavior,\nmaking the set of degenerate states with the smallest pseudo spin at a given\nenergy the only ones playing a role in the thermal properties, making the\npositive energy states thermally inaccesible. Their quantum phase transitions,\nfrom a normal to a superradiant phase, are closely associated with the thermal\ntransition. The other critical phenomena, the ESQPTs occurring at excited\nenergies, have no manifestation in the thermodynamics, although their effects\ncould be seen in finite sizes corrections. A new superradiant phase is found,\nwhich only exists in the generalized model, and can be relevant in finite size\nsystems.\n", "  Our aim is to characterize the polarized continuum emission properties\nincluding intensity, polarization position angle, and polarization percentage\nof Sgr A* at $\\sim$100 (3.0 mm), $\\sim$230 (1.3 mm), $\\sim$345 (0.87 mm),\n$\\sim$500 (0.6 mm), and $\\sim$700 GHz (0.43 mm). We report continuum emission\nproperties of Sgr A* at the above frequency bands, based on the Atacama Large\nMillimeter Array (ALMA) observations. We measured flux densities of Sgr A* from\nALMA single pointing and mosaic observations. We performed sinusoidal fittings\nto the observed (XX-YY)/I intensity ratios, to derive the polarization position\nangles and polarization percentages. We successfully detect polarized continuum\nemission from all observed frequency bands. We observed lower Stokes I\nintensity at $\\sim$700 GHz than that at $\\sim$500 GHz, which suggests that\nemission at $\\gtrsim$500 GHz is from optically thin part of a synchrotron\nemission spectrum. Both the Stokes I intensity and the polarization position\nangle at our highest observing frequency of $\\sim$700 GHz, may be varying with\ntime. However, we do not yet detect variation in the polarization percentage at\n$>$500 GHz. The polarization percentage at $\\sim$700 GHz is likely lower than\nthat at $\\sim$500 GHz. By comparing the $\\sim$500 GHz and $\\sim$700 GHz\nobservations with the observations at lower frequency bands, we suggest that\nthe intrinsic polarization position angle of Sgr A* is varying with time. This\npaper also reports the measurable polarization properties from the observed\ncalibration quasars. The future simultaneous multi-frequency polarization\nobservations are required for clarifying the time and frequency variation of\npolarization position angle and polarization percentage.\n", "  The linear-chain states of $^{14}$C are theoretically investigated by using\nthe antisymmetrized molecular dynamics. The calculated excitation energies and\nthe $\\alpha$ decay widths of the linear-chain states were compared with the\nobserved data reported by the recent experiments. The properties of the\npositive-parity linear-chain states reasonably agree with the observation, that\nconvinces us of the linear-chain formation in the positive-parity states. On\nthe other hand, in the negative-parity states, it is found that the\nlinear-chain configuration is fragmented into many states and do not form a\nsingle rotational band. As a further evidence of the linear-chain formation, we\nfocus on the $\\alpha$ decay pattern. It is shown that the linear-chain states\ndecay to the excited states of daughter nucleus $^{10}{\\rm Be}$ as well as to\nthe ground state, while other cluster states dominantly decay into the ground\nstate. Hence, we regard that this characteristic decay pattern is a strong\nsignature of the linear-chain formation.\n", "  We investigate the dynamics of fermionic atoms in a high-finesse optical\nresonator after a sudden switch on of the coupling between the atoms and the\ncavity. The atoms are additionally confined by optical lattices to a ladder\ngeometry. The tunneling mechanism on a rung of a ladder is induced by a cavity\nassisted Raman process. At long times after the quantum quench the arising\nsteady state can carry a chiral current. In this work we employ exact\ndiagonalization techniques on small system sizes to study the dissipative\nattractor dynamics after the quench towards the steady state and deviations of\nthe properties of the steady state from predictions obtained by adiabatically\neliminating the cavity mode.\n", "  Several classes of stellar binaries with post-main sequence (post-MS)\ncomponents - millisecond pulsars with the white dwarf companions (MSP+WD) and\nperiods P_b~30 d, binaries hosting post-asymptotic giant branch (post-AGB)\nstars or barium stars with P_b~several yr - feature high eccentricities (up to\n0.4) despite the expectation of their efficient tidal circularization during\nthe AGB phase. It was suggested that the eccentricities of these binaries can\nbe naturally excited by their tidal coupling to the circumbinary disk, formed\nby the material ejected from the binary. Here we critically reassess this idea\nusing simple arguments rooted in the global angular momentum conservation of\nthe disk+binary system. Compared to previous studies we (1) fully account for\nthe viscous spreading of the circumbinary disk, (2) consider the possibility of\nreaccretion from the disk onto the binary (in agreement with simulations and\nempirical evidence), and (3) allow for the reduced viscosity after the disk\nexpands, cools, and forms dust. These ingredients conspire to significantly\nlower the efficiency of eccentricity excitation by the disk tides. We find that\nexplaining eccentricities of the post-AGB binaries is difficult and requires\nmassive ($> 10^{-2}M_\\odot$), long-lived ($> 10^5$ yr) circumbinary disks, that\ndo not reaccrete. Reaccretion is detrimental for the eccentricity growth also\nin the MSP+WD systems. Reduced efficiency of the disk-driven excitation\nmotivates study of alternative mechanisms for producing the peculiar\neccentricities of the post-MS binaries.\n", "  In view of the searches at the LHC for scalar particle resonances in addition\nto the 125 GeV Higgs boson, we present the cross section for a CP-even scalar\nproduced via gluon fusion at N3LO in perturbative QCD assuming that it couples\ndirectly to gluons in an effective theory approach. We refine our prediction by\ntaking into account the possibility that the scalar couples to the top-quark\nand computing the corresponding contributions through NLO in perturbative QCD.\nWe assess the theoretical uncertainties of the cross section due to missing\nhigher-order QCD effects and we provide the necessary information for obtaining\nthe cross section value and uncertainty from our results in specific scenarios\nbeyond the Standard Model. We also give detailed results for the case of a 750\nGeV scalar, which will be the subject of intense experimental studies.\n", "  We numerically construct large Randall-Sundrum II brane black holes in 4 and\n5 dimensions from associated AdS/CFT spacetimes. Our solutions are leading\norder perturbations of a representative of the boundary conformal structure of\nthe AdS spacetime sourced by the dual CFT stress tensor. The 4-dimensional\nsolutions are static perturbations of the Euclidean Schwarzschild metric, while\nthe 5-dimensional solutions are perturbations of the Myers-Perry metric with\nequal angular momenta. We compare the former with previous numerical results\nfor Randall-Sundrum bulk black holes and find good agreement down to a horizon\nradius of about rH ~30l. The latter are the first numerical results pertaining\nto rotating Randall-Sundrum black holes. They have the same entropy, but a\nlarger horizon area than Myers-Perry black holes of the same mass and angular\nmomentum.\n", "  We perform a detailed numerical study of the equilibrium ground-state\nstructures of a binary rotating Bose-Einstein condensate with unequal atomic\nmasses. Our results show that the ground-state distribution and its related\nvortex configurations are complex events that differ markedly depending\nstrongly on the strength of rotation frequency, as well as on the ratio of\natomic masses. We also discuss the structure and radius of the clouds, the\nnumber and the size of the core region of the vortices, as a function of the\nrotation frequency, and of the ratio of atomic masses, and the analytical\nresults agree well with our numerical simulations. This work may open an\nalternate way in the quantum control of the binary rotating quantum gases with\nunequal atomic masses.\n", "  We constrain the internal dynamics of a stack of 10 clusters from the GCLASS\nsurvey at 0.87<z<1.34. We determine the stack cluster mass profile M(r) using\nthe MAMPOSSt algorithm of Mamon et al., the velocity anisotropy profile beta(r)\nfrom the inversion of the Jeans equation, and the pseudo-phase-space density\nprofiles Q(r) and Qr(r), obtained from the ratio between the mass density\nprofile and the third power of the (total and, respectively, radial) velocity\ndispersion profiles of cluster galaxies. Several M(r) models are statistically\nacceptable for the stack cluster (Burkert, Einasto, Hernquist, NFW). The total\nmass distribution has a concentration c=r200/r-2=4.0-0.6+1.0, in agreement with\ntheoretical expectations, and is less concentrated than the cluster\nstellar-mass distribution. The stack cluster beta(r) is similar for passive and\nstar-forming galaxies and indicates isotropic galaxy orbits near the cluster\ncenter and increasingly radially elongated with increasing cluster-centric\ndistance. Q(r) and Qr(r) are almost power-law relations with slopes similar to\nthose predicted from numerical simulations of dark matter halos. Combined with\nresults obtained for lower-z clusters we determine the dynamical evolution of\ngalaxy clusters, and compare it with theoretical predictions. We discuss\npossible physical mechanisms responsible for the differential evolution of\ntotal and stellar mass concentrations, and of passive and star-forming galaxy\norbits [abridged].\n", "  Radiative muon and tau lepton decays are described within the\nmodel-independent approach with the help of generalized Michel parameters. The\nexact dependence on charged lepton masses is taken into account. The results\nare relevant for modern and future experiments on muon and tau lepton decays.\n", "  Making use of integral forms and superfield techniques we propose\nsupersymmetric extensions of the multimetric gravity Lagrangians in dimensions\none, two, three and four. The supersymmetric interaction potential covariantly\ndeforms the bosonic one, producing in particular suitable super-symmetric\npolynomials generated by the Berezinian. As an additional application of our\nformalism we construct supersymmetric multi-Maxwell theories in dimensions\nthree and four.\n", "  A formalism for electronic-structure calculations is presented that is based\non the functional renormalization group (FRG). The traditional FRG has been\nformulated for systems that exhibit a translational symmetry with an associated\nFermi surface, which can provide the organization principle for the\nrenormalization group (RG) procedure. We here advance an alternative\nformulation, where the RG-flow is organized in the energy-domain rather than in\nk-space. This has the advantage that it can also be applied to inhomogeneous\nmatter lacking a band-structure, such as disordered metals or molecules. The\nenergy-domain FRG ({\\epsilon}FRG) presented here accounts for Fermi-liquid\ncorrections to quasi-particle energies and particle-hole excitations. It goes\nbeyond the state of the art GW-BSE, because in {\\epsilon}FRG the Bethe-Salpeter\nequation (BSE) is solved in a self-consistent manner. An efficient\nimplementation of the approach that has been tested against exact\ndiagonalization calculations and calculations based on the density matrix\nrenormalization group is presented.\n  Similar to the conventional FRG, also the {\\epsilon}FRG is able to signalize\nthe vicinity of an instability of the Fermi-liquid fixed point via runaway flow\nof the corresponding interaction vertex. Embarking upon this fact, in an\napplication of {\\epsilon}FRG to the spinless disordered Hubbard model we\ncalculate its phase-boundary in the plane spanned by the interaction and\ndisorder strength. Finally, an extension of the approach to finite temperatures\nand spin S = 1/2 is also given.\n", "  A general scalar-tensor theory can be formulated in different\nparametrizations that are related by a conformal rescaling of the metric and a\nscalar field redefinition. We compare formulations of slow-roll regimes in the\nEinstein and Jordan frames using quantities that are invariant under the\nconformal rescaling of the metric and transform as scalar functions under the\nreparametrization of the scalar field. By comparing spectral indices,\ncalculated up to second order, we find that the frames are equivalent up to\nthis order, due to the underlying assumptions.\n", "  We characterize non-perturbatively the R\\'enyi entropies of degree n=2,3,4,\nand 5 of three-dimensional, strongly coupled many-fermion systems in the\nscale-invariant regime of short interaction range and large scattering length,\ni.e. in the unitary limit. We carry out our calculations using lattice methods\ndevised recently by us. Our results show the effect of strong pairing\ncorrelations on the entanglement entropy, which modify the sub-leading behavior\nfor large subsystem sizes (as characterized by the dimensionless parameter x=kF\nL_A, where kF is the Fermi momentum and L_A the linear subsystem size), but\nleave the leading order unchanged relative to the non-interacting case.\nMoreover, we find that the onset of the sub-leading asymptotic regime is at\nsurprisingly small x=2-4. We provide further insight into the entanglement\nproperties of this system by analyzing the spectrum of the entanglement\nHamiltonian of the two-body problem from weak to strong coupling. The low-lying\nentanglement spectrum displays clear features as the strength of the coupling\nis varied, such as eigenvalue crossing, a sharp change in the Schmidt gap, and\nscale invariance at unitarity. Beyond the low-lying component, the spectrum\nappears as a quasi-continuum distribution, for which we present a statistical\ncharacterization; we find, in particular, that the mean shifts to infinity as\nthe coupling is turned off, which indicates that that part of the spectrum\nrepresents non-perturbative contributions to the entanglement Hamiltonian. In\ncontrast, the low-lying entanglement spectrum evolves to finite values in the\nnoninteracting limit. The scale invariance of the unitary regime guarantees\nthat our results are universal features intrinsic to 3D quantum mechanics and\nrepresent a well-defined prediction for ultracold atom experiments, which were\nrecently shown to have direct access to the entanglement entropy.\n", "  Using a suite of cosmology simulations of a sample of $> 120$ galaxy clusters\nwith $\\log(M_{DM, vir}) \\le 14.5$. We compare clusters that form in purely dark\nmatter run and their counterparts in hydro runs and investigate 4 independent\nparameters, that are normally used to classify dynamical state. We find that\nthe virial ratio $\\eta$ in hydro-dynamical runs is $\\sim 10$ per cent lower\nthan in the DM run, and there is no clear separation between the relaxed and\nunrelaxed clusters for any parameter. Further, using the velocity dispersion\ndeviation parameter $\\zeta$, which is defined as the ratio between cluster\nvelocity dispersion $\\sigma$ and the theoretical prediction $\\sigma_t = \\sqrt{G\nM_{total}/R}$, we find that there is a linear correlation between the virial\nratio $\\eta$ and this $\\zeta$ parameter. We propose to use this $\\zeta$\nparameter, which can be easily derived from observed galaxy clusters, as a\nsubstitute of the $\\eta$ parameter to quantify the cluster dynamical state.\n", "  We present the cluster selection function for three of the largest\nnext-generation stage-IV surveys in the optical and infrared:\nEuclid-Optimistic, Euclid-Pessimistic and the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope\n(LSST). To simulate these surveys, we use the realistic mock catalogues\nintroduced in the first paper of this series.\n  We detected galaxy clusters using the Bayesian Cluster Finder (BCF) in the\nmock catalogues. We then modeled and calibrated the total cluster stellar mass\nobservable-theoretical mass ($M^*_{\\rm CL}-M_{\\rm h}$) relation using a power\nlaw model, including a possible redshift evolution term. We find a moderate\nscatter of $\\sigma_{M^*_{\\rm CL} | M_{\\rm h}}$ of 0.124, 0.135 and 0.136 $\\rm\ndex$ for Euclid-Optimistic, Euclid-Pessimistic and LSST, respectively,\ncomparable to other work over more limited ranges of redshift. Moreover, the\nthree datasets are consistent with negligible evolution with redshift, in\nagreement with observational and simulation results in the literature.\n  We find that Euclid-Optimistic will be able to detect clusters with $>80\\%$\ncompleteness and purity down to $8\\times10^{13} h^{-1} M_{\\odot}$ up to $z<1$.\nAt higher redshifts, the same completeness and purity are obtained with the\nlarger mass threshold of $2\\times10^{14} h^{-1} M_{\\odot}$ up to $z=2$. The\nEuclid-Pessimistic selection function has a similar shape with $\\sim10\\%$\nhigher mass limit. LSST shows $\\sim 5\\%$ higher mass limit than\nEuclid-Optimistic up to $z<0.7$ and increases afterwards, reaching values of\n$2\\times10^{14} h^{-1} M_{\\odot}$ at $z=1.4$. Similar selection functions with\nonly $80\\%$ completeness threshold have been also computed. The complementarity\nof these results with selection functions for surveys in other bands is\ndiscussed.\n", "  We study the role of the anomalous $E=0$ state in dynamical properties of\nnon-interacting fermionic chains with chiral symmetry and correlated bond\ndisorder in one dimension. These models posses a diverging density of states at\nzero energy leading to a divergent localization length at the band center. By\nanalytically calculating the localization length for a finite system, we show\nthat correlations in the disorder modify the spatial decay of the $E = 0$ state\nfrom being quasilocalized to extended. We numerically simulate charge and\nentanglement propagation and provide evidence that states close to $E=0$\ndominate the dynamical properties. Remarkably, we find that correlations lead\nto subdiffusive charge propagation, whereas the growth of entanglement is\nlogarithmically slow. A logarithmic scaling of entanglement saturation with\nsystem size is also observed, which indicates a behavior akin to quantum\ncritical glasses.\n", "  Spacial variation of the orbital part of the order parameter of $^3$He-A in\naerogel is represented as a random walk of the unit vector $\\mathbf{l}$ in a\nfield of random anisotropy produced by the strands of aerogel. For a range of\ndistances, where variation of $\\mathbf{l}$ is small in comparison with its\nabsolute value correlation function of directions of $\\mathbf{l}(\\mathbf{r})$\nis expressed in terms of the correlation function of the random anisotropy\nfield. With simplifying assumptions about this correlation function a spatial\ndependence of the average variation $\\langle\\delta\\mathbf{l}^2\\rangle$ is found\nanalytically for isotropic and axially anisotropic aerogels. Average\nprojections of $\\mathbf{l}$ on the axes of anisotropy are expressed in terms of\ncharacteristic parameters of the problem. Within the \"model of random\ncylinders\" numerical estimations of characteristic length for disruption of the\nlong-range order and of the critical anisotropy for restoration of this order\nare made and compared with other estimations .\n", "  Simplified models of the dark matter (co)annihilation mechanism predict\nstriking new collider signatures untested by current searches. These models,\nwhich were codified in the coannihilation codex, provide the basis for a dark\nmatter (DM) discovery program at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) driven by the\nmeasured DM relic density. In this work, we study an exemplary model featuring\n$s$-channel DM coannihilation through a scalar diquark mediator as a\nrepresentative case study of scenarios with strongly interacting coannihilation\npartners. We discuss the full phenomenology of the model, ranging from low\nenergy flavor constraints, vacuum stability requirements, and precision Higgs\neffects to direct detection and indirect detection prospects. Moreover,\nmotivated by the relic density calculation, we find significant portions of\nparameter space are compatible with current collider constraints and can be\nprobed by future searches, including a proposed analysis for the novel\nsignature of a dijet resonance accompanied by missing transverse energy (MET).\nOur results show that the $13$ TeV LHC with $100~\\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$ luminosity\nshould be sensitive to mediators as heavy as 1 TeV and dark matter in the\n400--500 GeV range. The combination of searches for single and paired dijet\npeaks, non-resonant jets + MET excesses, and our novel resonant dijet + MET\nsignature have strong coverage of the motivated relic density region,\nreflecting the tight connections between particles determining the dark matter\nabundance and their experimental signatures at the LHC.\n", "  We study modular Hamiltonians corresponding to the vacuum state for deformed\nhalf-spaces in relativistic quantum field theories on $\\mathbb{R}^{1,d-1}$. We\nshow that in addition to the usual boost generator, there is a contribution to\nthe modular Hamiltonian at first order in the shape deformation, proportional\nto the integral of the null components of the stress tensor along the Rindler\nhorizon. We use this fact along with monotonicity of relative entropy to prove\nthe averaged null energy condition in Minkowski space-time. This subsequently\ngives a new proof of the Hofman-Maldacena bounds on the parameters appearing in\nCFT three-point functions. Our main technical advance involves adapting newly\ndeveloped perturbative methods for calculating entanglement entropy to the\nproblem at hand. These methods were recently used to prove certain results on\nthe shape dependence of entanglement in CFTs and here we generalize these\nresults to excited states and real time dynamics. We also discuss the AdS/CFT\ncounterpart of this result, making connection with the recently proposed\ngravitational dual for modular Hamiltonians in holographic theories.\n", "  We study numerically a system of two lasers cross-coupled optoelectronically\nwith a time delay where the output intensity of each laser modulates the pump\ncurrent of the other laser. We demonstrate control of chaos via variable\ncoupling time delay by converting the laser intensity chaos to the steady\nstate. We also show that wavelength chaos in an electrically tunable\ndistributed Bragg reflector laser diode with a feedback loop can be controlled\nvia variable feedback time delay.\n", "  The operations of Resistive Plate Chambers in LHC experiments require\nFluorine based (F-based) gases for optimal performance. Recent European\nregulations demand the use of environmentally unfriendly F-based gases to be\nlimited or banned. In view of the CMS experiment upgrade, several tests are\nongoing to measure the performance of the detector with these new ecological\ngas mixtures, in terms of efficiency, streamer probability, induced charge and\ntime resolution. Prototype chambers with readout pads and with the standard CMS\nelectronic setup are under test. In this paper preliminary results on\nperformance of RPCs operated with a potential eco-friendly gas candidate\n1,3,3,3-Tetrafluoropropene, commercially known as HFO-1234ze, with CO2 and CF3I\nbased gas mixtures are presented and discussed for the possible application in\nthe CMS experiment.\n", "  A few self-consistent schemes to solve the Hedin equations are presented.\nThey include vertex corrections of different complexity. Commonly used\nquasiparticle approximation for the Green function and static approximation for\nthe screened interaction are avoided altogether. Using alkali metals Na and K\nas well as semiconductor Si and wide gap insulator LiF as examples, it is shown\nthat both the vertex corrections in the polarizability P and in the self energy\n$\\Sigma$ are important. Particularly, vertex corrections in $\\Sigma$ with\nproper treatment of frequency dependence of the screened interaction always\nreduce calculated band widths/gaps, improving the agreement with experiment.\nThe complexity of the vertex included in P and in $\\Sigma$ can be different.\nWhereas in the case of polarizability one generally has to solve the\nBethe-Salpeter equation for the corresponding vertex function, it is enough\n(for the materials in this study) to include the vertex of the first order in\nthe self energy. The calculations with appropriate vertices show remarkable\nimprovement in the calculated band widths and band gaps as compared to the\nself-consistent GW approximation as well as to the self-consistent\nquasiparticle GW approximation.\n", "  ESA's Gaia space astrometry mission is performing an all-sky survey of\nstellar objects. At the beginning of the nominal mission in July 2014, an\noperation scheme was adopted that enabled Gaia to routinely acquire\nobservations of all stars brighter than the original limit of G~6, i.e. the\nnaked-eye stars. Here, we describe the current status and extent of those\nobservations and their on-ground processing. We present an overview of the data\nproducts generated for G<6 stars and the potential scientific applications.\nFinally, we discuss how the Gaia survey could be enhanced by further exploiting\nthe techniques we developed.\n", "  In the era of precision physics measurements at the LHC, efficient and\nexhaustive estimations of theoretical uncertainties play an increasingly\ncrucial role. In the context of Monte Carlo (MC) event generators, the\nestimation of such uncertainties traditionally requires independent MC runs for\neach variation, for a linear increase in total run time. In this work, we\nreport on an automated evaluation of the dominant (renormalization-scale and\nnon-singular) perturbative uncertainties in the PYTHIA 8 event generator, with\nonly a modest computational overhead. Each generated event is accompanied by a\nvector of alternative weights (one for each uncertainty variation), with each\nset separately preserving the total cross section. Explicit scale-compensating\nterms can be included, reflecting known coefficients of higher-order splitting\nterms and reducing the effect of the variations. The formalism also allows for\nthe enhancement of rare partonic splittings, such as $g \\to b \\bar{b}$ and\n$q\\to q \\gamma$, to obtain weighted samples enriched in these splittings while\npreserving the correct physical Sudakov factors.\n", "  The replica trick defines Renyi entropies as partition functions on conically\nsingular geometries. We discuss their gravity duals: regular bulk solutions to\nthe Einstein equations inducing conically singular metrics at the boundary.\nWhen the conical singularity is supported on a flat or spherical surface, these\nsolutions are rewritings of the hyperbolic black hole. For more general shapes,\nthese solutions are new. We construct them perturbatively in a double expansion\nin the distance and strength of the conical singularity, and extract the vacuum\npolarisation due to the cone. Recent results about the structure of logarithmic\ndivergences of Renyi entropies are reproduced ---in particular, $f_b\\neq f_c$.\nWe discuss in detail the dynamical resolution of the singularity in the bulk.\nThis resolution is in agreement with a previous proposal, and indicates a\nnon-minimal settling to the `splitting problem': an apparent ambiguity in the\nholographic entropy formula of certain theories with higher derivatives.\n", "  A recent novel derivation of the representation of Virasoro singular vectors\nin terms of Jack polynomials is extended to the supersymmetric case. The\nresulting expression of a generic super-Virasoro singular vector is given in\nterms of a simple differential operator (whose form is characteristic of the\nsector, Neveu-Schwarz or Ramond) acting on a Jack superpolynomial. The latter\nis indexed by a superpartition depending upon the two integers r,s that specify\nthe reducible module under consideration. The corresponding singular vector (at\ngrade rs/2), when expanded as a linear combination of Jack superpolynomials,\nresults in an expression that (in addition to being proved) turns out to be\nmore compact than those that have been previously conjectured. As an aside, in\nrelation with the differential operator alluded to above, a remarkable property\nof the Jack superpolynomials at alpha=-3 is pointed out.\n", "  If a photon interacts with a member of an entangled photon pair via a\nso-called Bell-state measurement (BSM), its state is teleported over\nprincipally arbitrary distances onto the second member of the pair. Starting in\n1997, this puzzling prediction of quantum mechanics has been demonstrated many\ntimes; however, with one very recent exception, only the photon that received\nthe teleported state, if any, travelled far while the photons partaking in the\nBSM were always measured closely to where they were created. Here, using the\nCalgary fibre network, we report quantum teleportation from a\ntelecommunication-wavelength photon, interacting with another telecommunication\nphoton after both have travelled over several kilometres in bee-line, onto a\nphoton at 795~nm wavelength. This improves the distance over which\nteleportation takes place from 818~m to 6.2~km. Our demonstration establishes\nan important requirement for quantum repeater-based communications and\nconstitutes a milestone on the path to a global quantum Internet.\n", "  It is argued that the experimentally observed phenomenon of asymmetric shapes\nof vector mesons produced in nuclear media during high energy nucleus-nucleus\ncollisions can be explained as Fano-Feshbach resonances. It has been observed\nthat the mass distributions of lepton pairs created at meson decays decline\nfrom the traditional Breit-Wigner shape with some excess in the low-mass wing\nof the resonance. It is clear that the whole phenomenon is related to some\ninteraction with the nuclear medium. Moreover, it can be further detalized in\nquantum mechanics as the interference of direct and continuum states in\nFano-Feshbach effect. To reveal the nature of the interaction it is proposed to\nuse a phenomenological model of the additional contribution due to Cherenkov\ngluons. They can be created because of the excess of the refractivity index\nover 1 just in the low-mass wing as required by the classical Cherenkov\ntreatment. In quantum mechanics, this requirement is related to the positive\nreal part of the interaction amplitude in this wing. The corresponding\nparameters are found from the comparison with $\\rho $-meson data and admit\nreasonable explanation.\n", "  The ground state and first excited state masses of Omega(b) and Omega(bb)\nbaryons are calculated in lattice QCD using dynamical 2+1 flavour gauge fields.\nA set of baryon operators employing different combinations of smeared quark\nfields was used in the framework of the variational method. Results for radial\nexcitation energies were confirmed by carrying out a supplementary\nmultiexponential fitting analysis. Comparison is made with quark model\ncalculations.\n", "  The Xinglong 2.16-m reflector is the first 2-meter class astronomical\ntelescope in China. It was jointly designed and built by the Nanjing\nAstronomical Instruments Factory (NAIF), Beijing Astronomical Observatory (now\nNational Astronomical Observatories, Chinese Academy of Sciences, NAOC) and\nInstitute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences in 1989. It is\nRitchey-Chr\\'{e}tien (R-C) reflector on an English equatorial mount and the\neffective aperture is 2.16 meters. It had been the largest optical telescope in\nChina for $\\sim18$ years until the Guoshoujing Telescope (also called Large Sky\nArea Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope, LAMOST) and the Lijiang 2.4-m\ntelescope were built. At present, there are three main instruments on the\nCassegrain focus available: the Beijing Faint Object Spectrograph and Camera\n(BFOSC) for direct imaging and low resolution ($R\\sim500-2000$) spectroscopy,\nthe spectrograph made by Optomechanics Research Inc. (OMR) for low resolution\nspectroscopy (the spectral resolutions are similar to those of BFOSC) and the\nfiber-fed High Resolution Spectrograph (HRS, $R\\sim30000-65000$). The telescope\nis widely open to astronomers all over China as well as international\nastronomical observers. Each year there are more than 40 ongoing observing\nprojects, including 6-8 key projects. Recently, some new techniques and\ninstruments (e.g., astro-frequency comb calibration system, polarimeter and\nadaptive optics) have been or will be tested on the telescope to extend its\nobserving abilities.\n", "  We describe the characteristics and performance of a camera system, Spectral\nenergy distribution Camera for Quasars in Early Universe (SQUEAN). It was\ndeveloped to measure SEDs of high redshift quasar candidates (z $\\gtrsim$ 5)\nand other targets, e.g., young stellar objects, supernovae, and gamma-ray\nbursts, and to trace the time variability of SEDs of objects such as active\ngalactic nuclei (AGNs). SQUEAN consists of an on-axis focal plane camera\nmodule, an auto-guiding system, and mechanical supporting structures. The\nscience camera module is composed of a focal reducer, a customizable filter\nwheel, and a CCD camera on the focal plane. The filter wheel uses filter\ncartridges that can house filters with different shapes and sizes, enabling the\nfilter wheel to hold twenty filters of 50 mm $\\times$ 50 mm size, ten filters\nof 86 mm $\\times$ 86 mm size, or many other combinations. The initial filter\nmask was applied to calibrate the filter wheel with high accuracy and we\nverified that the filter position is repeatable at much less than one pixel\naccuracy. We installed and tested 50 nm medium bandwidth filters of 600 --\n1,050 nm and other filters at the commissioning observation in 2015 February.\nWe found that SQUEAN can reach limiting magnitudes of 23.3 - 25.3 AB mag at\n5-$\\sigma$ in a 1-hour total integration time. - 25.3 AB mag at 5-$\\sigma$ in a\n1-hour total integration time.\n", "  We theoretically investigate the behavior of Andreev levels in a\nsingle-orbital interacting quantum dot in contact to superconducting leads,\nfocusing on the effect of electrostatic gating and applied magnetic field, as\nrelevant for recent experimental spectroscopic studies. In order to account\nreliably for spin-polarization effects in presence of correlations, we extend\nhere two simple and complementary approaches that are tailored to capture\neffective Andreev levels: the static functional renormalization group (fRG) and\nthe self-consistent Andreev bound states (SCABS) theory. We provide benchmarks\nagainst the exact large-gap solution as well as NRG calculations and find good\nquantitative agreement in the range of validity. The large flexibility of the\nimplemented approaches then allows us to analyze a sizeable parameter space,\nallowing to get a deeper physical understanding into the Zeeman field,\nelectrostatic gate, and flux dependence of Andreev levels in interacting\nnanostructures.\n", "  A number of phenomenologically relevant processes at hadron colliders, such\nas Higgs and Z boson production in association with b quarks, can be\nconveniently described as scattering of heavy quarks in the initial state. We\npresent a detailed analysis of this class of processes, identifying the form of\nthe leading initial-state collinear logarithms that allow the relation of\ncalculations performed in different flavour schemes in a simple and reliable\nway. This procedure makes it possible to assess the size of the logarithmically\nenhanced terms and the effects of their resummation via heavy-quark parton\ndistribution functions. As an application, we compare the production of\n(SM-like and heavy) scalar and vector bosons in association with b quarks at\nthe LHC in the four- and five-flavour schemes as well as the production of a\nheavy Z' in association with top quarks at a future 100 TeV hadron collider in\nthe five- and six-flavour schemes. We find that, in agreement with a previous\nanalysis of single heavy-quark initiated processes, the size of the\ninitial-state logarithms is mitigated by a kinematical suppression. The most\nimportant effects of the resummation are a shift of the central predictions\ntypically of about 20% at a justified value of the scale of each considered\nprocess and a significant reduction of scale variation uncertainties.\n", "  Topological solitons are relevant in several areas of physics [1]. Recently,\nthese configurations have been investigated in contexts as diverse as\nhydrodynamics [2], Bose-Einstein condensates [3], ferromagnetism [4], knotted\nlight [5] and non-abelian gauge theories [6]. In this paper we address the\nissue of wave propagation about a static Hopf soliton in the context of the\nNicole model. Working within the geometrical optics limit we show that several\nnontrivial lensing effects emerge due to nonlinear interactions as long as the\ntheory remains hyperbolic. We conclude that similar effects are very likely to\noccur in effective field theories characterized by a topological invariant such\nas the Skyrme model of pions.\n", "  Predictions made in Albacete {\\it et al} prior to the LHC $p+$Pb run at\n$\\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 5$ TeV are compared to currently available data. Some\npredictions shown here have been updated by including the same experimental\ncuts as the data. Some additional predictions are also presented, especially\nfor quarkonia, that were provided to the experiments before the data were made\npublic but were too late for the original publication are also shown here.\n", "  Radiative association and photodissociation rates are calculated for\nquadrupole transitions of H2. A complete set of bound and unbound states are\nincluded in a self-consistent master equation to obtain steady-state\nconcentrations for a dilute system of hydrogen atoms and molecules.\nPhenomenological rate constants computed from the steady-state concentrations\nsatisfy detailed balance for any combination of matter and radiation\ntemperature. Simple formulas are derived for expressing the steady-state\ndistributions in terms of equilibrium distributions. The rate constant for\nradiative association is found to be generally small for all temperature\ncombinations. The photodissociation rate constant for quadrupole transitions is\nfound to dominate the rate constants for other H2 photodestruction mechanisms\nfor radiation temperatures less than or equal to 3000 K. Implications for the\nformation and destruction of H2 in the early universe are discussed.\n", "  In this paper we address the issue of the non-perturbative quantization of\nEuclidean Yang-Mills theories in the Curci-Ferrari gauge. In particular, we\nconstruct a Refined Gribov-Zwanziger action for this gauge which takes into\naccount the presence of gauge copies as well as the dynamical formation of\ndimension two condensates. This action enjoys a non-perturbative BRST symmetry\nrecently proposed in \\cite{Capri:2015ixa}. Finally, we give attention to the\ngluon propagator in different space-time dimensions.\n", "  We present results from a survey of the internal kinematics of 49\nstar-forming galaxies at z$\\,\\sim\\,$2 in the CANDELS fields with the\nKeck/MOSFIRE spectrograph (SIGMA, Survey in the near-Infrared of Galaxies with\nMultiple position Angles). Kinematics (rotation velocity $V_{rot}$ and\nintegrated gas velocity dispersion $\\sigma_g$) are measured from nebular\nemission lines which trace the hot ionized gas surrounding star-forming\nregions. We find that by z$\\,\\sim\\,$2, massive star-forming galaxies\n($\\log\\,M_*/M_{\\odot}\\gtrsim10.2$) have assembled primitive disks: their\nkinematics are dominated by rotation, they are consistent with a marginally\nstable disk model, and they form a Tully-Fisher relation. These massive\ngalaxies have values of $V_{rot}/\\sigma_g$ which are factors of 2-5 lower than\nlocal well-ordered galaxies at similar masses. Such results are consistent with\nfindings by other studies. We find that low mass galaxies\n($\\log\\,M_*/M_{\\odot}\\lesssim10.2$) at this epoch are still in the early stages\nof disk assembly: their kinematics are often supported by gas velocity\ndispersion and they fall from the Tully-Fisher relation to significantly low\nvalues of $V_{rot}$. This \"kinematic downsizing\" implies that the process(es)\nresponsible for disrupting disks at z$\\,\\sim\\,$2 have a stronger effect and/or\nare more active in low mass systems. In conclusion, we find that the period of\nrapid stellar mass growth at z$\\,\\sim\\,$2 is coincident with the nascent\nassembly of low mass disks and the assembly and settling of high mass disks.\n", "  We report six new inflated hot Jupiters (HATS-25b through HATS-30b)\ndiscovered using the HATSouth global network of automated telescopes. The\nplanets orbit stars with $V$ magnitudes in the range $\\sim 12-14$ and have\nmasses in the largely populated $0.5M_J-0.7M_J$ region of parameter space but\nspan a wide variety of radii, from $1.17R_J$ to $1.75 R_J$. HATS-25b, HATS-28b,\nHATS-29b and HATS-30b are typical inflated hot Jupiters ($R_p = 1.17-1.26R_J$)\norbiting G-type stars in short period ($P=3.2-4.6$ days) orbits. However,\nHATS-26b ($R_p = 1.75R_J$, $P = 3.3024$ days) and HATS-27b ($R_p=1.50R_J$,\n$P=4.6370$ days) stand out as highly inflated planets orbiting slightly evolved\nF stars just after and in the turn-off points, respectively, which are among\nthe least dense hot Jupiters, with densities of $0.153$ g cm$^{-3}$ and $0.180$\ng cm$^{-3}$, respectively. All the presented exoplanets but HATS-27b are good\ntargets for future atmospheric characterization studies, while HATS-27b is a\nprime target for Rossiter-McLaughlin monitoring in order to determine its\nspin-orbit alignment given the brightness ($V = 12.8$) and stellar rotational\nvelocity ($v \\sin i \\approx 9.3$ km/s) of the host star. These discoveries\nsignificantly increase the number of inflated hot Jupiters known, contributing\nto our understanding of the mechanism(s) responsible for hot Jupiter inflation.\n", "  The giant Herbig-Haro object 222 extends over $\\sim$6$'$ in the plane of the\nsky, with a bow shock morphology. The identification of its exciting source has\nremained uncertain over the years. A non-thermal radio source located at the\ncore of the shock structure was proposed to be the exciting source. However,\nVery Large Array studies showed that the radio source has a clear morphology of\nradio galaxy and a lack of flux variations or proper motions, favoring an\nextragalactic origin. Recently, an optical-IR study proposed that this giant HH\nobject is driven by the multiple stellar system V380 Ori, located about 23$'$\nto the SE of HH 222. The exciting sources of HH systems are usually detected as\nweak free-free emitters at centimeter wavelengths. Here we report the detection\nof an elongated radio source associated with the Herbig Be star or with its\nclose infrared companion in the multiple V380 Ori system. This radio source has\nthe characteristics of a thermal radio jet and is aligned with the direction of\nthe giant outflow defined by HH~222 and its suggested counterpart to the SE,\nHH~1041. We propose that this radio jet traces the origin of the large scale HH\noutflow. Assuming that the jet arises from the Herbig Be star, the radio\nluminosity is a few times smaller than the value expected from the\nradio-bolometric correlation for radio jets, confirming that this is a more\nevolved object than those used to establish the correlation.\n", "  We study a testable dark matter (DM) model outside of the standard WIMP\nparadigm in which the observed ratio $\\Omega_{\\rm dark} \\simeq \\Omega_{\\rm\nvisible}$ for visible and dark matter densities finds its natural explanation\nas a result of their common QCD origin when both types of matter (DM and\nvisible) are formed at the QCD phase transition and both are proportional to\n$\\Lambda_{\\rm QCD}$. Instead of conventional \"baryogenesis\" mechanism we\nadvocate a paradigm when the \"baryogenesis\" is actually a charge separation\nprocess which always occur in the presence of the $\\cal{CP}$ odd axion field\n$a(x)$. In this scenario the global baryon number of the Universe remains zero,\nwhile the unobserved anti-baryon charge is hidden in form of heavy nuggets,\nsimilar to Witten's strangelets and compromise the DM of the Universe. We argue\nthat the nuggets will be inevitably produced during the QCD phase transition as\na result of Kibble-Zurek mechanism on formation of the topological defects\nduring a phase transition. Relevant topological defects in our scenario are the\nclosed bubbles made of the $N_{\\rm DW}=1$ axion domain walls. These bubbles, in\ngeneral, accrete the baryon (or anti baryon) charge, which eventually result in\nformation of the nuggets and anti-nuggets carrying a huge baryon (anti-baryon)\ncharge. The main consequence of the model, $\\Omega_{\\rm dark} \\approx\n\\Omega_{\\rm visible}$ is insensitive to the axion mass which may assume any\nvalue within the observationally allowed window $10^{-6} {\\rm eV} \\lesssim m_a\n\\lesssim 10^{-3}{\\rm eV}$. We also estimate the baryon to entropy ratio\n$\\eta\\equiv {n_B}/{n_{\\gamma}}\\sim 10^{-10}$ within this scenario. Finally, we\ncomment on implications of these results to the axion search experiments,\nincluding microwave cavity and the Orpheus experiments.\n", "  We consider type II string compactifications on Calabi-Yau orientifolds with\nfluxes and D-branes, and analyse the F-term scalar potential that\nsimultaneously involves closed and open string modes. In type IIA models with\nD6-branes such potential can be directly computed by integrating out Minkowski\nthree-forms. The result shows a multi-branched structure along the space of\nlifted open string moduli, in which discrete shifts in special Lagrangian and\nWilson line deformations are compensated by changes in the RR flux quanta. The\nsame sort of discrete shift symmetries are present in the superpotential and\nconstrain the Kahler potential. As for the latter, inclusion of open string\nmoduli breaks the factorisation between complex structure and Kahler moduli\nspaces. Nevertheless, the 4d Kahler metrics display a set of interesting\nrelations that allow to rederive the scalar potential analytically. Similar\nresults hold for type IIB flux compactifications with D7-brane Wilson lines.\n", "  The evaluation of generic Cachazo-He-Yuan(CHY)-integrands is a big challenge\nand efficient computational methods are in demand for practical evaluation. In\nthis paper, we propose a systematic decomposition algorithm by using\ncross-ratio identities, which provides an analytic and easy to implement method\nfor the evaluation of any CHY-integrand. This algorithm aims to decompose a\ngiven CHY-integrand containing higher-order poles as a linear combination of\nCHY-integrands with only simple poles in a finite number of steps, which\nultimately can be trivially evaluated by integration rules of simple poles. To\nmake the method even more efficient for CHY-integrands with large number of\nparticles and complicated higher-order pole structures, we combine the\n$\\Lambda$-algorithm and the cross-ratio identities, and as a by-product it\nprovides us a way to deal with CHY-integrands where the $\\Lambda$-algorithm was\nnot applicable in its original formulation.\n", "  In this paper, we consider Einstein gravity coupled to a vector field, either\nminimally or non-minimally, together with a vector potential of the type\n$V=2\\Lambda_0+\\ft 12 m^2 A^2+\\gamma_4 A^4$. For a simpler non-minimally coupled\ntheory with $\\Lambda_0=m=\\gamma_4=0$, we obtain both extremal and non-extremal\nblack hole solutions that are asymptotic to Minkowski space-times. We study the\nglobal properties of the solutions and derive the first law of thermodynamics\nusing Wald formalism. We find that the thermodynamical first laws of the\nextremal black holes are modified by a one form associated with the vector\nfield. In particular, due to the existence of the non-minimal coupling, the\nvector forms thermodynamic conjugates with the graviton mode and partly\ncontributes to the one form modifying the first laws. For a minimally coupled\ntheory with $\\Lambda_0\\neq 0$, we also obtain one class of asymptotically flat\nextremal black hole solutions in general dimensions. This is possible because\nthe parameters $(m^2,\\gamma_4)$ take certain values such that $V=0$. In\nparticular, we find that the vector also forms thermodynamic conjugates with\nthe graviton mode and contributes to the corresponding first laws, although the\nnon-minimal coupling has been turned off. Thus all the extremal black hole\nsolutions that we obtain provide highly non-trivial examples how the first law\nof thermodynamics can be modified by a either minimally or non-minimally\ncoupled vector field.\n  We also study Gauss-Bonnet gravity non-minimally coupled to a vector and\nobtain asymptotically flat black holes and Lifshitz black holes.\n", "  The Higgs boson discovered at the LHC opened a new chapter for particle\nphysics. Its properties need to be studied in detail to distinguish a purely\nstandard model (SM) Higgs boson from one of many scalars in an enlarged Higgs\nsector. The CMS collaboration has reported a possible lepton flavor violating\n(LFV) signal $h\\to\\mu\\tau$, which if confirmed, implies that the Higgs sector\nis larger than in the SM. New physics responsible for this type of decay may,\nin general, also introduce other observable effects such as charge-parity (CP)\nviolation in $h\\to \\tau\\tau$. We study two types of models that single out the\nthird generation and can induce large $h \\to \\mu\\tau$ rates with different\nconsequences for CP violation in $h \\to \\tau \\tau$. Predictions for the size of\nthe CP violating couplings require knowledge of the lepton Yukawa matrices and\nwe discuss this in the context of two different textures considering all\nexisting constraints.\n", "  We study a simple class of correlators with two heavy and two light operators\nboth in the D1D5 CFT and in the dual AdS$_3 \\times S^3 \\times T^4$ description.\nOn the CFT side we focus on the free orbifold point and discuss how these\ncorrelators decompose in terms of conformal blocks, showing that they are\ndetermined by protected quantities. On the gravity side, the heavy states are\ndescribed by regular, asymptotically AdS$_3 \\times S^3 \\times T^4$ solutions\nand the correlators are obtained by studying the wave equation in these\nbackgrounds. We find that the CFT and the gravity results agree and that, even\nin the large central charge limit, these correlators do not have (Euclidean)\nspurious singularities. We suggest that this is indeed a general feature of the\nheavy-light correlators in unitary CFTs, which can be relevant for\nunderstanding how information is encoded in black hole microstates.\n", "  Interacting fermions on the half-filled honeycomb lattice with short-range\nrepulsions have been suggested to host a variety of interesting many-body\nground states, e.g., a topological Mott insulator. A number of recent studies\nof the spinless case in terms of exact diagonalization, the infinite density\nmatrix renormalization group and the functional renormalization group, however,\nindicate a suppression of the topological Mott insulating phase in the whole\nrange of interaction parameters. Here, we complement the previous studies by\ninvestigating the quantum many-body instabilities of the physically relevant\ncase of spin-1/2 fermions with onsite, nearest-neighbor and\nsecond-nearest-neighbor repulsion. To this end, we employ the multi-patch\nfunctional renormalization group for correlated fermions with refined momentum\nresolution observing the emergence of an antiferromagnetic spin-density wave\nand a charge-density wave for dominating onsite and nearest-neighbor\nrepulsions, respectively. For dominating second-nearest neighbor interaction\nour results favor an ordering tendency towards a charge-modulated ground state\nover the topological Mott insulating state. The latter evades a stabilization\nas the leading instability by the additional onsite interaction.\n", "  The LHC is now studying in detail the couplings of the Higgs boson in order\nto determine if there is new physics. Many recent studies have examined the\navailable fits to Higgs couplings from the perspective of constraining two\nHiggs doublet models (2HDM). In this paper we extend those studies to include\nconstraints on the one loop couplings of the Higgs to gluons and photons. These\ncouplings are particularly sensitive to the existence of new colored particles\nthat are hard to detect otherwise and we use them to constrain a 2HDM augmented\nwith a color-octet scalar, a possibility motivated by minimal flavor violation.\nWe first study theoretical constraints on this model and then compare them with\nLHC measurements.\n", "  The letter introduces a diagram that rationalizes tunneling atomic force\nmicroscopy (TUNA) observations of electron emission from polycrystalline\ndiamonds as described in recent publications. The direct observations of\nelectron emission from grain boundary sites by TUNA could indeed be evidence of\nelectrons originating from grain boundaries under external electric fields. At\nthe same time, from the diagram it follows that TUNA and field emission schemes\nare complimentary rather than equivalent for results interpretation. It is\nfurther proposed that TUNA could provide better insights into emission\nmechanisms by measuring the detailed structure of the potential barrier on the\nsurface of polycrystalline diamonds.\n", "  We investigate the escape rate of an overdamped, self-propelled spherical\nBrownian particle on a surface from a metastable potential well. Within a\nmodeling in terms of a 1D constant speed of the particle's active dynamics we\nconsider the associated rate using both numerical and analytical approaches.\nRegarding the properties of the stationary state in the potential well, two\nmajor timescales exist, each governing the translational and the rotational\ndynamics of the particle, respectively. The particle radius is identified to\npresent the essential quantity in charge of regulating the ratio between those\ntimescales. For very small and very large particle radii, approximate analytic\nexpressions for the particle's escape rate can be derived, which, within their\nrespective range of validity, compare favorably with the precise escape\nnumerics of the underlying full two-dimensional Fokker-Planck description.\n", "  The simplest network of coupled phase-oscillators exhibiting chimera states\nis given by two populations with disparate intra- and inter-population coupling\nstrengths. We explore the effects of heterogeneous coupling phase-lags between\nthe two populations. Such heterogeneity arises naturally in various settings,\nfor example as an approximation to transmission delays, excitatory-inhibitory\ninteractions, or as amplitude and phase responses of oscillators with\nelectrical or mechanical coupling. We find that breaking the phase-lag symmetry\nresults in a variety of states with uniform and non-uniform synchronization,\nincluding in-phase and anti-phase synchrony, full incoherence (splay state),\nchimeras with phase separation of $0$ or $\\pi$ between populations, and states\nwhere both populations remain desynchronized. These desynchronized states\nexhibit stable, oscillatory, and even chaotic dynamics. Moreover, we identify\nthe bifurcations through which chimeras emerge. Stable chimera states and\ndesynchronized solutions, which do not arise for homogeneous phase-lag\nparameters, emerge as a result of competition between synchronized in-phase,\nanti-phase equilibria, and fully incoherent states when the phase-lags are near\n$\\pm\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ (cosine coupling). These findings elucidate previous\nexperimental results involving a network of mechanical oscillators and provide\nfurther insight into the breakdown of synchrony in biological systems.\n", "  Adiabatic quantum algorithms represent a promising approach to universal\nquantum computation. Whilst in a closed system these algorithms are limited by\navoided level crossings, where the gap becomes exponentially small in the\nsystem size, their robustness in open systems remains unresolved. We study the\ndynamics in the proximity of such an avoided level crossing associated with the\nadiabatic quantum search algorithm in a quantum system that is coupled to a\ngeneric environment. At zero temperature, we find that the algorithm remains\nscalable provided the noise spectral density of the environment decays\nsufficiently fast at low frequencies. At finite temperature, however,\nscattering processes render the algorithm inefficient and no quantum speedup\ncan be achieved. Owing to the generic nature of our model, we expect our\nresults to be widely applicable to other adiabatic quantum algorithms.\n", "  An ideal solid-state supermirror (SM) neutron polarizer assumes total\nreflection of neutrons from the SM coating for one spin-component and total\nabsorption for the other, thus providing a perfectly polarized neutron beam at\nthe exit. However, in practice, the substrate's neutron-nucleai optical\npotential does not match perfectly that for spin-down neutrons in the SM. For a\npositive step in the optical potential (as in a Fe/SiN(x) SM on Si substrate),\nthis mismatch results in spin-independent total reflection for neutrons with\nsmall momentum transfer Q, limiting the useful neutron bandwidth in the low-Q\nregion. To overcome this limitation, we propose to replace Si single-crystal\nsubstrates by media with higher optical potential than that for spin-down\nneutrons in the SM ferromagnetic layers. We found single-crystal sapphire and\nsingle-crystal quartz as good candidates for solid-state Fe/SiN(x) SM\npolarizers. To verify this idea, we coated a thick plate of single-crystal\nsapphire with a m=2.4 Fe/SiN(x) SM. At the T3 instrument at the ILL, we\nmeasured the spin-up and spin-down reflectivity curves with 7.5 A neutrons\nincident from the substrate to the interface between the substrate and the SM\ncoating. The results of this experimental test were in excellent agreement with\nour expectations: the bandwidth of high polarizing power extended significantly\ninto the low-Q region. This finding, together with the possibility to apply a\nstrong magnetizing field, opens a new road to produce high-efficient\nsolid-state SM polarizers with an extended neutron wavelength bandwidth and\nnear-to-perfect polarizing power.\n", "  In the first part of this paper, we calculate the disk-level S-matrix\nelements of one RR, one NSNS and one NS vertex operators, and show that they\nare consistent with the amplitudes that have been recently found by applying\nvarious Ward identities. We show that the massless poles of the amplitude at\nlow energy are fully consistent with the known D-brane couplings at order\n$\\alpha'^2$ which involve one RR or NSNS and two NS fields. Subtracting the\nmassless poles, we then find the contact terms of one RR, one NSNS and one NS\nfields at order $\\alpha'^2$. Some of these terms are reproduced by the Taylor\nexpansion and the pull-back of two closed string couplings, some other\ncouplings are reproduced by linear graviton in the second fundamental form and\nby the B-field in the gauge field extension $F\\rightarrow F+B$, in one closed\nand two open string couplings.\n  In the second part, we write all independent covariant contractions of one\nRR, one NSNS and one NS fields with unknown coefficients. We then constrain the\ncouplings to be consistent with the linear T-duality and with the above contact\nterms. Interestingly, we have found that up to total derivative terms and\nBianchi identities, these constraints uniquely fix all the unknown\ncoefficients.\n", "  We study a simplified scenario in the next-to-minimal supersymmetric standard\nmodel with a split electroweak spectrum, in which only the singlino and\nhiggsinos are light and other superpartners are decoupled. Serving as a dark\nmatter candidate, a singlino-dominated neutralino $\\tilde{\\chi}_1^0$ should\nhave either resonant annihilation effects or sizable higgsino components to\nsatisfy the observed relic abundance. The sensitivities of LHC searches and\ndark matter detection experiments are investigated. With an integrated\nluminosity of $30 (300) \\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$, $3l + E_\\mathrm{T} \\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!/\n\\;\\;\\;$and $2l + E_\\mathrm{T} \\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!/ \\;\\;\\;$ searches at the 13 (14)\nTeV LHC are expected to reach up to $m_{\\tilde{\\chi}_1^0}\\sim 150 (230)\n\\mathrm{GeV}$ and $m_{\\tilde{\\chi}_2^0,\\tilde{\\chi}_1^{\\pm}}\\sim 320 (480)\n\\mathrm{GeV}$. Near future dark matter direct and indirect detection\nexperiments can cover some parameter regions where collider searches lose their\nsensitivities.\n", "  The habitability of an exoplanet depends on many factors. One such factor is\nthe impact of stellar eruptive events on nearby exoplanets. Currently this is\npoorly constrained due to heavy reliance on solar scaling relationships and a\nlack of experimental evidence. Potential impacts of Coronal Mass Ejections\n(CMEs), which are a large eruption of magnetic field and plasma from a star,\nare space weather and atmospheric stripping. A method for observing CMEs as\nthey travel though the stellar atmosphere is the type II radio burst, and the\nnew LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR) provides a means for detection. We report on 15\nhours of observation of YZ Canis Minoris (YZ CMi), a nearby M dwarf flare star,\ntaken in LOFAR's beam-formed observation mode for the purposes of measuring\ntransient frequency-dependent low frequency radio emission. The observations\nutilized Low-Band Antenna (10-90 MHz) or High-Band Antenna (110-190 MHz) for\nfive three-hour observation periods. In this data set, there were no confirmed\ntype II events in this frequency range. We explore the range of parameter space\nfor type II bursts constrained by our observations Assuming the rate of shocks\nis a lower limit to the rate at which CMEs occur, no detections in a total of\n15 hours of observation places a limit of $\\nu_{type II} < 0.0667$ shocks/hr $\n\\leq \\nu_{CME}$ for YZ CMi due to the stochastic nature of the events and\nlimits of observational sensitivity. We propose a methodology to interpret\njointly observed flares and CMEs which will provide greater constraints to CMEs\nand test the applicability of solar scaling relations.\n", "  The quantum steering ellipsoid can be used to visualise two-qubit states, and\nthus provides a generalisation of the Bloch picture for the single qubit.\nRecently, a monogamy relation for the volumes of steering ellipsoids has been\nderived for pure 3-qubit states and shown to be stronger than the celebrated\nCoffman-Kundu-Wootters (CKW) inequality. We first demonstrate the close\nconnection between this volume monogamy relation and the classification of pure\n3-qubit states under stochastic local operations and classical communication\n(SLOCC). We then show that this monogamy relation does not hold for general\nmixed 3-qubit states and derive a weaker monogamy relation that does hold for\nsuch states. We also prove a volume monogamy relation for pure 4-qubit states,\nand generalize our 3-qubit inequality to n qubits. Finally, we study the effect\nof noise on the quantum steering ellipsoid and find that the volume of any\ntwo-qubit state is non-increasing when the state is exposed to arbitrary local\nnoise. This implies that any volume monogamy relation for a given class of\nmulti-qubit states remains valid under the addition of local noise. We\ninvestigate this quantitatively for the experimentally relevant example of\nisotropic noise.\n", "  Using the AdS/CFT duality, we study the expectation value of stress tensor in\n$2+1$-dimensional quantum critical theories with a general dynamical scaling\n$z$, and explore various constrains on negative energy density for strongly\ncoupled field theories. The holographic dual theory is the theory of gravity in\n3+1-dimensional Lifshitz backgrounds. We adopt a consistent approach to obtain\nthe boundary stress tensor from bulk construction, which satisfies the trace\nWard identity associated with Lifshitz scaling symmetry. In particular, the\nboundary stress tensor, constructed from the gravitational wave deformed\nLifshitz geometry, is found up to second order in gravitational wave\nperturbations. {The result} is compared to its counterpart in free {scalar}\nfield theory at the same order in an expansion of small squeezing parameters.\nThis allows us to relate the boundary values of gravitational waves to the\nsqueezing parameters of squeezed vacuum states. We find that, in both cases\nwith $z=1$, the stress tensor satisfies the averaged null energy condition, and\nis consistent with the quantum interest conjecture. Moreover, the negative\nlower bound on null-contracted stress tensor, which is averaged over time-like\ntrajectories along nearly null directions, is obtained. We find a weaker\nconstraint on the magnitude and duration of negative null energy density in\nstrongly coupled field theory as compared with the constraint in free\nrelativistic field theory. The implications are discussed.\n", "  In a Rindler-type coordinate system spanned in a region outside of a black\nhole horizon, we have nonvanishing classical holographic charges as soft hairs\non the horizon for stationary black holes. Taking a large black hole mass\nlimit, the spacetimes with the charges are described by asymptotic Rindler\nmetrics. We construct a general theory of gravitational holographic charges for\na (1+3)-dimensional linearized gravity field in the Minkowski background with\nRindler horizons. Although matter crossing a Rindler horizon causes horizon\ndeformation and a time-dependent coordinate shift, that is, gravitational\nmemory, the supertranslation and superrotation charges on the horizon can be\ndefined during and after its passage through the horizon. It is generally\nproven that holographic states on the horizon cannot store any information\nabout absorbed perturbative gravitational waves. However, matter crossing the\nhorizon really excites holographic states. By using gravitational memory\noperators, which consist of the holographic charge operators, we suggest a\nresolution of the no-cloning paradox of quantum information between matter\nfalling into the horizon and holographic charges on the horizon from the\nviewpoint of the contextuality of quantum measurement.\n", "  We determined the parameters of a classical spin Hamiltonian describing an Fe\nmonolayer on Pd(111) surface with a Pt_{1-x}Ir_{x} alloy overlayer from ab\ninitio calculations. While the ground state of the system is ferromagnetic for\nx=0.00, it becomes a spin spiral state as Ir is intermixed into the overlayer.\nAlthough the Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya interaction is present in the system, we will\ndemonstrate that the frustrated isotropic exchange interactions play a\nprominent role in creating the spin spiral state, and these frustrated\ncouplings lead to an attractive interaction between skyrmions at short\ndistances. Using spin dynamics simulations, we show that under these conditions\nthe individual skyrmions form clusters, and that these clusters remain stable\nat finite temperature.\n", "  High transverse magnetic field and zero field muon spin rotation and\nrelaxation measurements have been carried out in a lightly oxygen-doped high-Tc\nparent compound La2CuO4 in a temperature range from 2 K to 300 K. As in the\nstoichiometric compound, muon spin rotation spectra reveal, along with the\nantiferromagnetic local field, the presence of an additional source of magnetic\nfield at the muon. The results indicate that this second magnetic order is\ndriven by the antiferromagnetism at low temperature but the two magnetic orders\ndecouple at higher temperature. The ability of muSR to detect this additional\nmagnetism deteriorates with doping, thus rendering the technique impotent to\nreveal time-reversal symmetry breaking in superconductors.\n", "  Topologically stable structures include vortices in a wide variety of matter,\nsuch as skyrmions in ferro- and antiferromagnets, and hedgehog point defects in\nliquid crystals and ferromagnets. These are characterized by integer-valued\ntopological quantum numbers. In this context, closed surfaces are a prominent\nsubject of study as they form a link between fundamental mathematical theorems\nand real physical systems. Here we perform an analysis on the topology and\nstability of equilibrium magnetization states for a thin spherical shell with\neasy-axis anisotropy in normal directions. Skyrmion solutions are found for a\nrange of parameters. These magnetic skyrmions on a spherical shell have two\ndistinct differences compared to their planar counterpart: (i) they are\ntopologically trivial, and (ii) can be stabilized by curvature effects, even\nwhen Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions are absent. Due to its specific\ntopological nature a skyrmion on a spherical shell can be simply induced by a\nuniform external magnetic field.\n", "  We use high time cadence, high spectral resolution optical observations to\ndetect excess H-alpha emission from the 2 - 3 Myr old weak lined T Tauri star\nPTFO8-8695. This excess emission appears to move in velocity as expected if it\nwere produced by the suspected planetary companion to this young star. The\nexcess emission is not always present, but when it is, the predicted velocity\nmotion is often observed. We have considered the possibility that the observed\nexcess emission is produced by stellar activity (flares), accretion from a\ndisk, or a planetary companion; we find the planetary companion to be the most\nlikely explanation. If this is the case, the strength of the H-alpha line\nindicates that the emission comes from an extended volume around the planet,\nlikely fed by mass loss from the planet which is expected to be overflowing its\nRoche lobe.\n", "  We present a method for relieving aluminum 3D transmon qubits from a silicon\nsubstrate using micromachining. Our technique is a high yield, one-step deep\nreactive ion etch that requires no additional fabrication processes, and\nresults in the suspension of the junction area and edges of the aluminum film.\nThe drastic change in the device geometry affects both the dielectric and flux\nnoise environment experienced by the qubit. In particular, the participation\nratios of various dielectric interfaces are significantly modified, and\nsuspended qubits exhibited longer $T_1$'s than non-suspended ones. We also find\nthat suspension increases the flux noise experienced by tunable SQUID-based\nqubits.\n", "  We evaluate in the framework of QCD factorization the two-loop vertex\ncorrections to the decays $\\bar{B}_{(s)}\\to D_{(s)}^{(\\ast)+} \\, L^-$ and\n$\\Lambda_b \\to \\Lambda_c^+ \\, L^-$, where $L$ is a light meson from the set\n$\\{\\pi,\\rho,K^{(\\ast)},a_1\\}$. These decays are paradigms of the QCD\nfactorization approach since only the colour-allowed tree amplitude contributes\nat leading power. Hence they are sensitive to the size of power corrections\nonce their leading-power perturbative expansion is under control. Here we\ncompute the two-loop ${\\cal O}(\\alpha_s^2)$ correction to the leading-power\nhard scattering kernels, and give the results for the convoluted kernels almost\ncompletely analytically. Our newly computed contribution amounts to a positive\nshift of the magnitude of the tree amplitude by $\\sim 2$\\%. We then perform an\nextensive phenomenological analysis to NNLO in QCD factorization, using the\nmost recent values for non-perturbative input parameters. Given the fact that\nthe NNLO perturbative correction and updated values for form factors increase\nthe theory prediction for branching ratios, while experimental central values\nhave at the same time decreased, we reanalyze the role and potential size of\npower corrections by means of appropriately chosen ratios of decay channels.\n", "  We explore N=(1,0) superconformal six-dimensional theories arising from\nM5-branes probing a transverse A_k singularity. Upon circle compactification to\n5 dimensions, we describe this system with a dual pq-web of five-branes and\npropose the spectrum of basic five-dimensional instanton operators driving\nglobal symmetry enhancement. For a single M5-brane, we find that the exact\npartition function of the 5d quiver gauge theory matches the 6d (1,0) index,\nwhich we compute by letter counting. We finally show that S-duality of the\npq-web implies new relations among vertex correlators of qW-algebrae.\n", "  We investigate the non-perturbative stability of supersymmetric\ncompactifications with respect to decay via a bubble of nothing. We show\nexamples where this kind of instability is not prohibited by the spin\nstructure, i.e., periodicity of fermions about the extra dimension. However,\nsuch \"topologically unobstructed\" cases do exhibit an extra-dimensional analog\nof the well-known Coleman-De Luccia suppression mechanism, which prohibits the\ndecay of supersymmetric vacua. We demonstrate this explicitly in a four\ndimensional Abelian-Higgs toy model coupled to supergravity. The\ncompactification of this model to $M_3 \\times S_1$ presents the possibility of\nvacua with different windings for the scalar field. Away from the\nsupersymmetric limit, these states decay by the formation of a bubble of\nnothing, dressed with an Abelian-Higgs vortex. We show how, as one approaches\nthe supersymmetric limit, the circumference of the topologically unobstructed\nbubble becomes infinite, thereby preventing the realization of this decay. This\ndemonstrates the dynamical origin of the decay suppression, as opposed to the\nmore familiar argument based on the spin structure. We conjecture that this is\na generic mechanism that enforces stability of any topologically unobstructed\nsupersymmetric compactification.\n", "  Gene regulatory networks can be successfully modeled as Boolean networks. A\nmuch discussed hypothesis says that such model networks reproduce empirical\nfindings the best if they are tuned to operate at criticality, i.e. at the\nborderline between their ordered and disordered phases. Critical networks have\nbeen argued to lead to a number of functional advantages such as maximal\ndynamical range, maximal sensitivity to environmental changes, as well as to an\nexcellent trade off between stability and flexibility. Here, we study the\neffect of noise within the context of Boolean networks trained to learn complex\ntasks under supervision. We verify that quasi-critical networks are the ones\nlearning in the fastest possible way --even for asynchronous updating rules--\nand that the larger the task complexity the smaller the distance to\ncriticality. On the other hand, when additional sources of intrinsic noise in\nthe network states and/or in its wiring pattern are introduced, the optimally\nperforming networks become clearly subcritical. These results suggest that in\norder to compensate for inherent stochasticity, regulatory and other type of\nbiological networks might become subcritical rather than being critical, all\nthe most if the task to be performed has limited complexity.\n", "  In the last two decades Resistive Plate Chambers were employed in the Cosmic\nRay Experiments COVER-PLASTEX and ARGO/YBJ. In both experiments the detectors\nwere housed indoors, likely owing to gas distribution requirements and the need\nto control environment variables that directly affect RPCs operational\nstability. But in experiments where Extended Air Shower (EAS) sampling is\nnecessary, large area arrays composed by dispersed stations are deployed,\nrendering this kind of approach impossible. In this situation, it would be\nmandatory to have detectors that could be deployed in small standalone\nstations, with very rare opportunities for maintenance, and with good\nresilience to environmental conditions. Aiming to meet these requirements, we\nstarted some years ago the development of RPCs for Autonomous Stations. The\nresults from indoor tests and measurements were very promising, both concerning\nperformance and stability under very low gas flow rate, which is the main\nrequirement for Autonomous Stations. In this work we update the indoor results\nand show the first ones concerning outdoor stable operation. In particular, a\ndynamic adjustment of the high voltage is applied to keep gas gain constant.\n", "  In this paper, we apply our sky map reconstruction method for transit type\ninterferometers to the Tianlai cylinder array. The method is based on the\nspherical harmonic decomposition, and can be applied to cylindrical array as\nwell as dish arrays and we can compute the instrument response, synthesised\nbeam, transfer function and the noise power spectrum. We consider cylinder\narrays with feed spacing larger than half wavelength, and as expected, we find\nthat the arrays with regular spacing have grating lobes which produce spurious\nimages in the reconstructed maps. We show that this problem can be overcome,\nusing arrays with different feed spacing on each cylinder. We present the\nreconstructed maps, and study the performance in terms of noise power spectrum,\ntransfer function and beams for both regular and irregular feed spacing\nconfigurations.\n", "  Atrial fibrillation (AF) increases the risk of stroke by a factor of four to\nfive and is the most common abnormal heart rhythm. The progression of AF with\nage, from short self-terminating episodes to persistence, varies between\nindividuals and is poorly understood. An inability to understand and predict\nvariation in AF progression has resulted in less patient-specific therapy.\nLikewise, it has been a challenge to relate the microstructural features of\nheart muscle tissue (myocardial architecture) with the emergent temporal\nclinical patterns of AF. We use a simple model of activation wavefront\npropagation on an anisotropic structure, mimicking heart muscle tissue, to show\nhow variation in AF behaviour arises naturally from microstructural differences\nbetween individuals. We show that the stochastic nature of progressive\ntransversal uncoupling of muscle strands (e.g., due to fibrosis or gap\njunctional remodelling), as occurs with age, results in variability in AF\nepisode onset time, frequency, duration, burden and progression between\nindividuals. This is consistent with clinical observations. The uncoupling of\nmuscle strands can cause critical architectural patterns in the myocardium.\nThese critical patterns anchor micro-re-entrant wavefronts and thereby trigger\nAF. It is the number of local critical patterns of uncoupling as opposed to\nglobal uncoupling that determines AF progression. This insight may eventually\nlead to patient specific therapy when it becomes possible to observe the\ncellular structure of a patient's heart.\n", "  We study the transition in dimensionality of a three-dimensional\nmagnetohydrodynamic flow forced only mechanically, when the strength of a\nmagnetic guiding field is gradually increased. We use numerical simulations to\nconsider cases in which the mechanical forcing injects (or not) helicity in the\nflow. As the guiding field is increased, the strength of the magnetic field\nfluctuations decrease as a power law of the guiding field intensity. We show\nthat for strong enough guiding fields, the helical magnetohydrodynamic flow can\nbecome almost two-dimensional. In this case, the mechanical energy can undergo\na process compatible with an inverse cascade, being transferred preferentially\ntowards scales larger than the forcing scale. The presence of helicity changes\nthe spectral scaling of the small magnetic field fluctuations, and affects the\nstatistics of the velocity field and of the velocity gradients. Moreover, at\nsmall scales the dynamics of the flow becomes dominated by a direct cascade of\nhelicity, which can be used to derive scaling laws for the velocity field.\n", "  The James Webb Space Telescope near-infrared camera (JWST NIRCam) has two\n2.'2 $\\times$ 2.'2 fields of view that are capable of either imaging or\nspectroscopic observations. Either of two $R \\sim 1500$ grisms with orthogonal\ndispersion directions can be used for slitless spectroscopy over $\\lambda = 2.4\n- 5.0$ $\\mu$m in each module, and shorter wavelength observations of the same\nfields can be obtained simultaneously. We present the latest predicted grism\nsensitivities, saturation limits, resolving power, and wavelength coverage\nvalues based on component measurements, instrument tests, and end-to-end\nmodeling. Short wavelength (0.6 -- 2.3 $\\mu$m) imaging observations of the 2.4\n-- 5.0 $\\mu$m spectroscopic field can be performed in one of several different\nfilter bands, either in-focus or defocused via weak lenses internal to NIRCam.\nAlternatively, the possibility of 1.0 -- 2.0 $\\mu$m spectroscopy\n(simultaneously with 2.4 -- 5.0 $\\mu$m) using dispersed Hartmann sensors (DHSs)\nis being explored. The grisms, weak lenses, and DHS elements were included in\nNIRCam primarily for wavefront sensing purposes, but all have significant\nscience applications. Operational considerations including subarray sizes, and\ndata volume limits are also discussed. Finally, we describe spectral simulation\ntools and illustrate potential scientific uses of the grisms by presenting\nsimulated observations of deep extragalactic fields, galactic dark clouds, and\ntransiting exoplanets.\n", "  The high pseudo-rapidity region of the CMS muon system is covered by Cathode\nStrip Chambers (CSC) only and lacks redundant coverage despite the fact that it\nis a challenging region for muons in terms of backgrounds and momentum\nresolution. In order to maintain good efficiency for the muon trigger in this\nregion additional RPCs are planned to be installed in the two outermost\nstations at low angle named RE3/1 and RE4/1. These stations will use RPCs with\nfiner granularity and good timing resolution to mitigate background effects and\nto increase the redundancy of the system.\n", "  We consider a RG flow in a general su(2) coset model perturbed by the least\nrelevant field. The perturbing field as well as some particular fields of\ndimension close to one are constructed recursively in terms of lower level\nfields. Using this construction we obtain the structure constants and the\nfour-point correlation functions in the leading order. This allows us to\ncompute the mixing coefficients among the fields in the UV and the IR theory.\nIt turns out that they are in agreement with those found recently using the\ndomain wall construction up to this order.\n", "  We consider Abelian tensor hierarchy in four-dimensional ${\\cal N}=1$\nsupergravity in the conformal superspace formalism, where the so-called\ncovariant approach is used to antisymmetric tensor fields. We introduce\n$p$-form gauge superfields as superforms in the conformal superspace. We solve\nthe Bianchi identities under the constraints for the superforms. As a result,\neach of form fields is expressed by a single gauge invariant superfield. The\naction of superforms is shown with the invariant superfields. We also show the\nrelation between the superspace formalism and the superconformal tensor\ncalculus.\n", "  In the spacetime induced by a rotating cosmic string we compute the energy\nlevels of a massive spinless particle coupled covariantly to a homogeneous\nmagnetic field parallel to the string. Afterwards, we consider the addition of\na scalar potential with a Coulomb-type and a linear confining term and\ncompletely solve the Klein-Gordon equations for each configuration. Finally,\nassuming rigid-wall boundary conditions, we find the Landau levels when the\nlinear defect is itself magnetized. Remarkably, our analysis reveals that the\nLandau quantization occurs even in the absence of gauge fields provided the\nstring is endowed with spin.\n", "  Multi-photon interference results in modulations of output probabilities with\nphase shift periods that are much shorter than 2 Pi. Here, we investigate the\nphysics behind these statistical patterns in the case of well-defined photon\nnumbers in the input and output modes of a two-path interferometer. We show\nthat the periodicity of the multi-photon interference is related to the weak\nvalue of the unobserved intensity difference between the two arms of the\ninterferometer. This means that the operator relations between the photon\nnumber differences in input, path, and output can be used to determine the\nperiodicity of the experimentally observed quantum interference, establishing\nan important link between the classical causality of random phase interference\nand quantum effects that depend on the superposition of classically distinct\npossibilities.\n", "  Generation of zonal ow (ZF) by energetic particle (EP) driven toroidal Alfven\neigenmode (TAE) is investigated using nonlinear gyrokinetic theory. It is found\nthat, nonlinear resonant EP contri- bution dominates over the usual Reynolds\nand Maxwell stresses due to thermal plasma nonlinear response. ZF can be forced\ndriven in the linear growth stage of TAE, with the growth rate being twice the\nTAE growth rate. The ZF generation mechanism is shown to be related to\npolarization induced by resonant EP nonlinearity. The generated ZF has both the\nusual meso-scale and micro- scale radial structures. Possible consequences of\nthis forced driven ZF on the nonlinear dynamics of TAE are also discussed.\n", "  The behavior of coupled disordered one-dimensional systems, as modelled by\nidentical fermionic Hubbard chains with the on-site potential disorder and\ncoupling emerging through the inter-chain hopping $t'$, is analysed. The study\nis motivated by the experiment on fermionic cold atoms on a disordered lattice,\nwhere a decay rate of the quenched density wave was measured. We present a\nderivation of the decay rate $\\Gamma$ within perturbation theory and show that\neven at large disorder along the chains the interaction leads to finite $\\Gamma\n> 0$, the mechanism being the interaction-induced coupling of in-chain\nlocalized and inter-chain extended single-fermion states. Explicit expressions\nfor $\\Gamma$ are presented for a weak interaction $U < t,t'$, but extended also\nto the regime $t > U >t'$. It is shown that in both regimes $\\Gamma$ increases\nwith the inter-chain hopping $t'$, as well as decreases with increasing\ndisorder.\n", "  Even in absence of earthquakes, each site on earth experiences continuous\nelastic vibrations which are mostly traced to the non-linear interactions of\nsea waves. However, the fine structure of the spectrum at mHz frequencies shows\nhundreds of highly significant narrow bandwidth peaks, with a persistence and a\ncoincidence with solar acoustic eigenmodes which are incompatible with any\ngeophysical origin. The feasibility of a common cosmic origin is evaluated\nthrough an estimate of the gravitational wave cross-section of the earth,\ncombined with its elastic response and with the stochastic amplification\nproduced by the interference of the cosmic signal with tremor of oceanic\norigin. The measured spectral peaks appear compatible with a gravitational\nmonochromatic illumination at strains $h \\gtrsim 10^{-20} $. We analize in\ndetail the band around 2.614 mHz, where the binary white dwarf J0651+2844 -\nwhich is the second strongest known gravitational stellar source - is expected\nto emit. Compatible spectral tremor peaks are found for both the earth and the\nsun, but their amplitude is 3 o.m. larger than independent estimates, so that a\ngravitational source attribution would call for a variety of unknown\nnon-luminous sources with definite mass-distance ratios.\n", "  We summarize the papers published by Einstein in the Annalen der Physik in\nthe years 1902-04 on the derivation of the properties of thermal equilibrium on\nthe basis of the mechanical equations of motion and of the calculus of\nprobabilities. We point out the line of thought that led Einstein to an\nespecially economical foundation of the discipline, and to focus on\nfluctuations of the energy as a possible tool for establishing the validity of\nthis foundation. We also sketch a comparison of Einstein's approach with that\nof Gibbs, suggesting that although they obtained similar results, they had\ndifferent motivations and interpreted them in very different ways.\n", "  Barab\\'asi-Albert model describes many different natural networks, often\nyielding sensible explanations to the subjacent dynamics. However, finite size\neffects may prevent from discerning among different underlying physical\nmechanisms and from determining whether a particular finite system is driven by\nBarab\\'asi-Albert dynamics. Here we propose master equations for the evolution\nof the degrees, links and triangles distributions, solve them both analytically\nand by numerical iteration, and compare with numerical simulations. The\nanalytic solutions for all these distributions predict the network evolution\nfor systems as small as 100 nodes. The analytic method we developed is\napplicable for other classes of networks, representing a powerful tool to\ninvestigate the evolution of natural networks.\n", "  The Maupertuis principle allows us to regard classical trajectories as\nreparametrized geodesics of the Jacobi-Maupertuis (JM) metric on configuration\nspace. We study this geodesic reformulation of the planar three-body problem\nwith both Newtonian and attractive inverse-square potentials. The associated JM\nmetrics possess translation and rotation isometries in addition to scaling\nisometries for the inverse-square potential with zero energy E. The geodesic\nflow on the full configuration space $C^3$ (with collision points excluded)\nleads to corresponding flows on its Riemannian quotients: the center of mass\nconfiguration space $C^2$ and shape space $R^3$ (as well as $S^3$ and the shape\nsphere $S^2$ for the inverse-square potential when E = 0). The corresponding\nRiemannian submersions are described explicitly in `Hopf' coordinates which are\nparticularly adapted to the isometries. For equal masses subject to\ninverse-square potentials, Montgomery shows that the zero-energy `pair of\npants' JM metric on the shape sphere is geodesically complete and has negative\ngaussian curvature except at Lagrange points. We extend this to a proof of\nboundedness and strict negativity of scalar curvatures everywhere on $C^2, R^3$\n& $S^3$ with collision points removed. Sectional curvatures are also found to\nbe largely negative, indicating widespread geodesic instabilities. We obtain\nasymptotic metrics near collisions, show that scalar curvatures have finite\nlimits and observe that the geodesic reformulation `regularizes' pairwise and\ntriple collisions on $C^2$ and its quotients for arbitrary masses and allowed\nenergies. For the Newtonian potential with equal masses and E=0, we find that\nthe scalar curvature on $C^2$ is strictly negative though it could have either\nsign on $R^3$. However, unlike for the inverse-square potential, geodesics can\nencounter curvature singularities at collisions in finite geodesic time.\n", "  We propose a geometric method to study the residual symmetries in $N=2$,\n$d=4$ $\\text{U}(1)$ Fayet-Iliopoulos (FI) gauged supergravity. It essentially\ninvolves the stabilization of the symplectic vector of gauge couplings (FI\nparameters) under the action of the U-duality symmetry of the ungauged theory.\nIn particular we are interested in those transformations that act non-trivially\non the solutions and produce scalar hair and dyonic black holes from a given\nseed. We illustrate the procedure for finding this group in general and then\nshow how it works in some specific models. For the prepotential $F=-iX^0X^1$,\nwe use our method to add one more parameter to the rotating Chow-Comp\\`ere\nsolution, representing scalar hair.\n", "  Recent years have seen an upsurge of interest in dynamical realizations of\nthe superconformal group SU(1,1|2) in mechanics. Remarking that SU(1,1|2) is a\nparticular member of a chain of supergroups SU(1,1|n) parametrized by an\ninteger n, here we begin a systematic study of SU(1,1|n) multi-particle\nmechanics. A representation of the superconformal algebra su(1,1|n) is\nconstructed on the phase space spanned by m copies of the (1,2n,2n-1)\nsupermultiplet. We show that the dynamics is governed by two prepotentials V\nand F, and the Witten-Dijkgraaf-Verlinde-Verlinde equation for F shows up as a\nconsequence of a more general fourth-order equation. All solutions to the\nlatter in terms of root systems reveal decoupled models only. An extension of\nthe dynamical content of the (1,2n,2n-1) supermultiplet by angular variables in\na way similar to the SU(1,1|2) case is problematic.\n", "  Understanding the thermodynamic state of the hot intracluster medium (ICM) in\na galaxy cluster requires a knowledge of the plasma transport processes,\nespecially thermal conduction. The basic physics of thermal conduction in\nplasmas with ICM-like conditions has yet to be elucidated, however. We use\nparticle-in-cell simulations and analytic models to explore the dynamics of an\nICM-like plasma (with small gyroradius, large mean-free-path, and strongly\nsub-dominant magnetic pressure) driven by the diffusive heat flux associated\nwith thermal conduction. Lin- ear theory reveals that whistler waves are driven\nunstable electron heat flux, even when the heat flux is weak. The resonant\ninteraction of electrons with these waves then plays a critical role in\nscattering electrons and suppressing the heat flux. In a 1D model where only\nwhistler modes that are parallel to the magnetic field are captured, the only\nresonant electrons are moving in the opposite direction to the heat flux and\nthe electron heat flux suppression is small. In 2D or more, oblique whistler\nmodes also resonate with electrons moving in the direction of the heat flux.\nThe overlap of resonances leads to effective symmetrization of the electron\ndistribution function and a strong suppression of heat flux. The results\nsuggest that thermal conduction in the ICM might be strongly suppressed,\npossibly to negligible levels.\n", "  In the spirit of the fewest switches surface hopping, the frozen Gaussian\napproximation with surface hopping (FGA-SH) method samples a path integral\nrepresentation of the non-adiabatic dynamics in the semiclassical regime. An\nimproved sampling scheme is developed in this work for FGA-SH based on birth\nand death branching processes. The algorithm is validated for the standard test\nexamples of non-adiabatic dynamics.\n", "  We compute the flat coordinates on the Frobenius manifolds arising on the\ndeformation space of Gepner $\\hat{SU}(3)_k$ chiral rings. The explicit form of\nthe flat coordinates is important for exact solutions of models of topological\nCFT and 2d Liouville gravity. We describe the case k=3, which is of particular\ninterest because apart from the relevant chiral fields it contains a marginal\none. Whereas marginal perturbations are relevant in different contexts, their\nanalysis requires additional care compared to the relevant perturbations.\n", "  The thermal properties of the light decuplet baryons are investigated in the\nframework of the thermal QCD sum rules. In particular, the behavior of the mass\nand residue of the $\\Delta$, $\\Sigma^{*}$, $\\Xi^{*}$ and $\\Omega$ baryons with\nrespect to temperature are analyzed taking into account the additional\noperators coming up in the Wilson expansion at finite temperature. It is found\nthat the mass and residue of these particles remain overall unaffected up to\n$T\\simeq150~MeV$ but, beyond this point, they start to diminish, considerably.\n", "  When a collection of quantum emitters interacts with an electromagnetic\nfield, the whole system can enter into the collective strong coupling regime in\nwhich hybrid light-matter states, i.e., polaritons can be created. Only a small\nportion of excitations in the emitters are coupled to the light field, and\nthere are many dark states that, in principle, retain their pure excitonic\nnature. Here we theoretically demonstrate that these dark states can have a\ndelocalized character, which is inherent to polaritons, despite the fact that\nthey do not have a photonic component. This unexpected behavior only appears\nwhen the electromagnetic field displays a discrete spectrum. In this case, when\nthe main loss mechanism in the hybrid system stems from the radiative losses of\nthe light field, dark states are even more efficient than polaritons in\ntransferring excitations across the structure.\n", "  Complex Langevin simulations allow numerical studies of theories that exhibit\na sign problem, such as QCD, and are thereby potentially suitable to determine\nthe QCD phase diagram from first principles. Here we study QCD in the limit of\nheavy quarks for a wide range of temperatures and chemical potentials. Our\nresults include an analysis of the adaptive gauge cooling technique, which\nprevents large excursions into the non-compact directions of the SL($3,\n\\mathbb{C}$) manifold. We find that such excursions may appear spontaneously\nand change the statistical distribution of physical observables, which leads to\ndisagreement with known results. Results whose excursions are sufficiently\nsmall are used to map the boundary line between confined and deconfined quark\nphases.\n", "  The gas and dust are spatially segregated in protoplanetary disks due to the\nvertical settling and radial drift of large grains. A fuller accounting of the\nmass content and distribution in disks therefore requires spectral line\nobservations. We extend the modeling approach presented in Williams & Best\n(2014) to show that gas surface density profiles can be measured from high\nfidelity 13CO integrated intensity images. We demonstrate the methodology by\nfitting ALMA observations of the HD 163296 disk to determine a gas mass, Mgas =\n0.048 solar masse, and accretion disk characteristic size Rc = 213au and\ngradient gamma = 0.39. The same parameters match the C18O 2--1 image and\nindicates an abundance ratio [13CO]/[C18O] of 700 independent of radius. To\ntest how well this methodology can be applied to future line surveys of\nsmaller, lower mass T Tauri disks, we create a large 13CO 2--1 image library\nand fit simulated data. For disks with gas masses 3-10 Jupiter masses at 150pc,\nALMA observations with a resolution of 0.2-0.3 arcseconds and integration times\nof about 20 minutes allow reliable estimates of Rc to within about 10au and\ngamma to within about 0.2. Economic gas imaging surveys are therefore feasible\nand offer the opportunity to open up a new dimension for studying disk\nstructure and its evolution toward planet formation.\n", "  In this paper, we develop Hamiltonian particle-in-cell methods for\nVlasov-Maxwell equations by applying conforming finite element methods in space\nand splitting methods in time. For the spatial discretisation, the criteria for\nchoosing finite element spaces are presented such that the semi-discrete system\npossesses a discrete non-canonical Poisson structure. We apply a Hamiltonian\nsplitting method to the semi-discrete system in time, then the resulting\nalgorithm is Poisson preserving and explicit. The conservative properties of\nthe algorithm guarantee the efficient and accurate numerical simulation of the\nVlasov-Maxwell equations over long-time.\n", "  In this work, we have performed Monte Carlo simulations in a classical model\nfor RFe$_{1-x}$Cr$_x$O$_3$ with R=Y and Lu, comparing the numerical simulations\nwith experiments and mean field calculations. In the analyzed compounds, the\nantisymmetric exchange or Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction induced a weak\nferromagnetism due to a canting of the antiferromagnetically ordered spins.\nThis model is able to reproduce the magnetization reversal (MR) observed\nexperimentally in a field cooling process for intermediate $x$ values and the\ndependence with $x$ of the critical temperatures. We also analyzed the\nconditions for the existence of MR in terms of the strength of DM interactions\nbetween Fe$^{3+}$ and Cr$^{3+}$ ions with the x values variations.\n", "  We explore a \"partial unification\" model that could explain the diphoton\nevent excess around $750 \\, \\rm GeV$ recently reported by the LHC experiments.\nA new strong gauge group is combined with the ordinary color and hypercharge\ngauge groups. The VEV responsible for the combination is of the order of the\n$SU(2)\\times U(1)$ breaking scale, but the coupling of the new physics to\nstandard model particles is suppressed by the strong interaction of the new\ngauge group. This simple extension of the standard model has a rich\nphenomenology, including composite particles of the new confining gauge\ninteraction, a coloron and a $Z'$ which are rather weakly coupled to standard\nmodel particles, and massive vector bosons charged under both the ordinary\ncolor and hypercharge gauge groups and the new strong gauge group. The new\nscalar glueball could have mass of around $750 \\, \\rm GeV$, be produced by\ngluon fusion and decay into two photons, both through loops of the new massive\nvector bosons. The simplest version of the model has some issues: the massive\nvector bosons are stable and the coloron and the $Z'$ are strongly constrained\nby search data. An extension of the model to include additional fermions with\nthe new gauge coupling, though not as simple and elegant, can address both\nissues and more. It allows the massive vector boson to decay into a colorless,\nneutral state that could be a candidate of the dark matter. And the coloron and\n$Z'$ can decay dominantly into the new fermions, completely changing the search\nbounds. In addition, $SU(N)$ fermions below the symmetry breaking scale make it\nmore plausible that the lightest glueball is at $750$~GeV. Whatever becomes of\nthe $750$~GeV diphoton excess, the model is an unusual example of how new\nphysics at small scales could be hidden by strong interactions.\n", "  The interaction of high intensity laser radiation with underdense plasma may\nlead to the formation of electron vortices. Though being quasistationary on an\nelectron timescales, these structures tend to expand on a proton timescale due\nto Coloumb repulsion of ions. Using a simple analytical model of a stationary\nvortex as initial condition, 2D PIC simulations are performed. A number of\neffects are observed such as vortex boundary field intensification, multistream\ninstabilities at the vortex boundary, and bending of the vortex boundary with\nthe subsequent transformation into smaller electron vortices.\n", "  We try to reconcile the tension between the local 2.4\\% determination of\nHubble constant and its global determination by $\\textit{Planck}$ CMB data and\nBAO data through modeling the dark energy variously. We find that the\nchi-square is significantly reduced by $\\Delta\\chi^2_\\text{all}=-6.76$ in the\nredshift-binned dark energy model where the $68\\%$ limits of the equation of\nstate of dark energy read $w(0\\leq z\\leq 0.1)=-1.958_{-0.508}^{+0.509}$,\n$w(0.1< z\\leq 1.5)=-1.006_{-0.082}^{+0.092}$, and here $w(z>1.5)$ is fixed to\n$-1$.\n", "  Comets are considered as the most primitive objects in the Solar System.\nTheir composition provides information on the composition of the primitive\nsolar nebula, 4.6 Gyr ago. The radio domain is a privileged tool to study the\ncomposition of cometary ices. Observations of the OH radical at 18 cm\nwavelength allow us to measure the water production rate. A wealth of molecules\n(and some of their isotopologues) coming from the sublimation of ices in the\nnucleus have been identified by observations in the millimetre and\nsubmillimetre domains. We present an historical review on radio observations of\ncomets, focusing on the results from our group, and including recent\nobservations with the Nan\\c{c}ay radio telescope, the IRAM antennas, the Odin\nsatellite, the Herschel space observatory, ALMA, and the MIRO instrument aboard\nthe Rosetta space probe.\n", "  The Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) coupling, $\\alpha_s$, is not a physical\nobservable of the theory since it depends on conventions related to the\nrenormalization procedure. We introduce a definition of the QCD coupling,\ndenoted by $\\hat\\alpha_s$, whose running is explicitly renormalization scheme\ninvariant. The scheme dependence of the new coupling $\\hat\\alpha_s$ is\nparameterized by a single parameter $C$, related to transformations of the QCD\nscale $\\Lambda$. It is demonstrated that appropriate choices of $C$ can lead to\nsubstantial improvements in the perturbative prediction of physical\nobservables. As phenomenological applications, we study $e^+e^-$ scattering and\ndecays of the $\\tau$ lepton into hadrons, both being governed by the QCD Adler\nfunction.\n", "  It has been suggested that the comet-like activity of Main Belt Comets are\ndue to the sublimation of sub-surface water-ice that has been exposed as a\nresult of their surfaces being impacted by m-sized bodies. We have examined the\nviability of this scenario by simulating impacts between m-sized and km-sized\nobjects using a smooth particle hydrodynamics approach. Simulations have been\ncarried out for different values of the impact velocity and impact angle as\nwell as different target material and water-mass fraction. Results indicate\nthat for the range of impact velocities corresponding to those in the asteroid\nbelt, the depth of an impact crater is slightly larger than 10 m suggesting\nthat if the activation of MBCs is due to the sublimation of sub-surface\nwater-ice, this ice has to exist no deeper than a few meters from the surface.\nResults also show that ice-exposure occurs in the bottom and on the interior\nsurface of impact craters as well as the surface of the target where some of\nthe ejected icy inclusions are re-accreted. While our results demonstrate that\nthe impact scenario is indeed a viable mechanism to expose ice and trigger the\nactivity of MBCs, they also indicate that the activity of the current MBCs is\nlikely due to ice sublimation from multiple impact sites and/or the water\ncontents of these objects (and other asteroids in the outer asteroid belt) is\nlarger than the 5% that is traditionally considered in models of terrestrial\nplanet formation providing more ice for sublimation. We present details of our\nsimulations and discuss their results and implications.\n", "  Relatively recently (A. Amaya-Tapia, S. Y. Larsen and M. Lassaut. Ann. Phys.,\nvol. 306 (2011) 406), we presented a formula for the evaluation of the third\nBose fugacity coefficient - leading to the third virial coefficient - in terms\nof three-body eigenphase shifts, for particles subject to repulsive forces. An\nanalytical calculation for a 1-dim. model, for which the result is known,\nconfirmed the validity of this approach. We now extend the formalism to\nparticles with attractive forces, and therefore must allow for the possibility\nthat the particles have bound states. We thus obtain a true generalization of\nthe famous formula of Uhlenbeck and Beth (G.E. Uhlenbeck and E. Beth. Physica,\nvol. 3 (1936) 729; E. Beth and G.E. Uhlenbeck. ibid, vol.4 (1937) 915) (and of\nGropper (L. Gropper. Phys. Rev. vol. 50 (1936) 963; ibid vol. 51 (1937) 1108))\nfor the second virial. We illustrate our formalism by a calculation, in an\nadiabatic approximation, of the third cluster in one dimension, using McGuire's\nmodel as in our previous paper, but with attractive forces. The inclusion of\nthree-body bound states is trivial; taking into account states having\nasymptotically two particles bound, and one free, is not.\n", "  We present the images of a \\textit{Hubble Space Telescope}\n(\\textit{HST}/WFC3) snapshot program of angularly compact Galactic planetary\nnebulae (PNe), acquired with the aim of studying their size, evolutionary\nstatus, and morphology. PNe that are smaller than $\\sim4\\arcsec$ are\nunderrepresented in most morphological studies, and today they are less well\nstudied than their immediate evolutionary predecessors, the pre-planetary\nnebulae. The images have been acquired in the light of\n[\\ion{O}{3}]$\\lambda5007$, which is commonly used to classify the PN\nmorphology, in the UV continuum with the aim of detecting the central star\nunambiguously, and in the $I-$band to detect a cool stellar companion, if\npresent. The sample of 51 confirmed PNe exhibits nearly the full range of\nprimary morphological classes, with the distribution more heavily weighted\ntoward bipolar PNe, but with total of aspherical PNe almost identical to that\nof the general Galactic sample. A large range of microstructures is evident in\nour sample as well, with many nebulae displaying attached shells, halos, ansae,\nand internal structure in the form of arcs, rings, and spirals. Various\naspherical structures in a few PNe, including detached arcs, suggest an\ninteraction with the ISM. We studied the observed sample of compact Galactic\nPNe in the context of the general Galactic PN population, and explore whether\ntheir physical size, spatial distribution, reddening, radial metallicity\ngradient, and possible progenitors, are peculiar within the population of\nGalactic PNe. We found that these compact Galactic PNe, which have been\nselected based on apparent dimensions, constitute a diverse Galactic PN\npopulation that is relatively uniformly distributed across the Galactic disk,\nincluding the outskirts of our Galaxy. This unique sample will be used in the\nfuture to probe the old Galactic disk population.\n", "  Verifiable blind quantum computing is a secure delegated quantum computing\nwhere a client with a limited quantum technology delegates her quantum\ncomputing to a server who has a universal quantum computer. The client's\nprivacy is protected (blindness) and the correctness of the computation is\nverifiable by the client in spite of her limited quantum technology\n(verifiability). There are mainly two types of protocols for verifiable blind\nquantum computing: the protocol where the client has only to generate\nsingle-qubit states, and the protocol where the client needs only the ability\nof single-qubit measurements. The latter is called the measurement-only\nverifiable blind quantum computing. If the input of the client's quantum\ncomputing is a quantum state whose classical efficient description is not known\nto the client, there was no way for the measurement-only client to verify the\ncorrectness of the input. Here we introduce a new protocol of measurement-only\nverifiable blind quantum computing where the correctness of the quantum input\nis also verifiable.\n", "  The holographic entanglement entropy is studied numerically in\n(4+1)-dimensional spherically symmetric Gauss-Bonnet AdS black hole spacetime\nwith compact boundary. On the bulk side the black hole spacetime undergoes a\nvan der Waals-like phase transition in the extended phase space, which is\nreviewed with emphasis on the behavior on the temperature-entropy plane. On the\nboundary, we calculated the regularized HEE of a disk region of different\nsizes. We find strong numerical evidence for the failure of equal area law for\nisobaric curves on the temperature-HEE plane and for the correctness of first\nlaw of entanglement entropy, and briefly give an explanation for why the latter\nmay serve as a reason for the former, i.e. the failure of equal area law on the\ntemperature-HEE plane.\n", "  Aims. In this work, we characterize the low mass companion of the A0 field\nstar HR3549. Methods. We observed HR3549AB in imaging mode with the the NIR\nbranch (IFS and IRDIS) of SPHERE@VLT, with IFS in YJ mode and IRDIS in the H\nband. We also acquired a medium resolution spectrum with the IRDIS long slit\nspectroscopy mode. The data were reduced using the dedicated SPHERE GTO\npipeline, purposely designed for this instrument. We employed algorithms such\nas PCA and TLOCI to reduce the speckle noise. Results. The companion was\nclearly visible both with IRDIS and IFS.We obtained photometry in four\ndifferent bands as well as the astrometric position for the companion. Based on\nour astrometry, we confirm that it is a bound object and put constraints on its\norbit. Although several uncertainties are still present, we estimate an age of\n~100-150 Myr for this system, yielding a most probable mass for the companion\nof 40-50MJup and T_eff ~300-2400 K. Comparing with template spectra points to a\nspectral type between M9 and L0 for the companion, commensurate with its\nposition on the color-magnitude diagram.\n", "  Inspired by the recent single $e^{\\pm}\\mu^{\\mp}$ event at 2.1 TeV invariant\nmass from the ATLAS at $\\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV with 3.2 fb$^{-1}$ luminosity, we\npropose an explanation using a $Z'$ gauge boson, which possesses\nlepton-flavor-changing neutral currents originated from non-universal couplings\nto charged leptons. We assume that the left-handed charged-lepton mixing matrix\nequals to the PMNS matrix and no mixing in the neutrino sector to make this\nphenomenological $Z'$ model more predictive. There are indeed some parameter\nregions, where the $Z'$ can generate a large enough $e^{\\pm}\\mu^{\\mp}$\nproduction cross section, while at the same time satisfies various observables\nfrom lepton-flavor violation and other constraints from the LHC.\n", "  We calculate the chameleon field profile, confined between two parallel\nplates, filled with air at pressure $P = 10^{-4}\\,{\\rm mbar}$ and room\ntemperature and separated by the distance $L$, in the chameleon field theory\nwith Ratra--Peebles self--interaction potential with index $n = 1$. We give the\nexact analytical solution in terms of Jacobian elliptic functions, depending on\nthe mass density of the ambient matter. The obtained analytical solution can be\nused in qBounce experiments, measuring transition frequencies between quantum\ngravitational states of ultracold neutrons and also for the calculation of the\nchameleon field induced Casimir force for the CANNEX experiment. We show that\nthe chameleon--matter interactions with coupling constants $\\beta \\le 10^4$ can\nbe probed by qBounce experiments with sensitivities $\\Delta E \\le\n10^{-18}\\,{\\rm eV}$. At $L = 30.1\\,{\\rm \\mu m}$ we reproduce the result $\\beta\n< 5.8\\times 10^8$, obtained by Jenke {\\it et al.} Phys. Rev. Lett. {\\bf 112},\n151105 (2014)) at sensitivity $\\Delta E \\sim 10^{-14}\\,{\\rm eV}$. In the\nvicinity of one of the plates our solution coincides with the solution,\nobtained by Brax and Pignol (Phys. Rev. Lett. {\\bf 107}, 111301 (2011)) (see\nalso Ivanov {\\it et al.} Phys. Rev. D {\\bf 87}, 105013 (2013)) above a plate at\nzero density of the ambient matter.\n", "  We study the wetting properties of water on silica surfaces using molecular\ndynamics (MD) simulations. To describe the intermolecular interaction between\nwater and silica atoms, two types of interaction potential models are used: the\nstandard Br\\'odka and Zerda (BZ) model, and the Gulmen and Thompson (GT) model.\nWe perform an in-depth analysis of the influence of the choice of the potential\non the arrangement of the water molecules in partially filled pores and on top\nof silica slabs. We find that at moderate pore filling ratios, the GT silica\nsurface is completely wetted by water molecules, which agrees well with\nexperimental findings, while the commonly used BZ surface is less hydrophilic\nand is only partially wetted. We interpret our simulation results using an\nanalytical calculation of the phase diagram of water in partially filled pores.\nMoreover, an evaluation of the contact angle of the water droplet on top of the\nsilica slab reveals that the interaction becomes more hydrophilic with\nincreasing slab thickness and saturates around 2.5-3 nm, in agreement with the\nexperimentally found value. Our analysis also shows that the hydroaffinity of\nthe surface is mainly determined by the electrostatic interaction, but that the\nvan der Waals interaction nevertheless is strong enough that it can turn a\nhydrophobic surface into a hydrophilic surface.\n", "  The slope of the beta function at a fixed point is commonly thought to be RG\ninvariant and to be the critical exponent gamma* that governs the approach of\nany physical quantity R to its fixed-point limit: R*-R proportional to\nQ^gamma*. Chyla has shown that this is not quite true. Here we define a proper\nRG invariant, the \"effective exponent\" gamma(Q), whose fixed-point limit is the\ntrue gamma*.\n", "  The geometrically frustrated antiferromagnetic Swedenborgite\nDyBaCo$_{4}$O$_{7}$ is investigated by a combination of xray diffraction,\nmagnetization and dielectric measurements. Systematic doping in the series\nDy$_{1-x}$Ca$_{x}$BaCo$_{4}$O$_{7}$ causes a lifting of the geometrical\nfrustration resulting in a structural transition from a Trigonal P31c to an\northorhombic Pbn2$_{1 }$ symmetry at $x=0.4$. This structural transition can\nalso be accessed as a function of temperature, and all our orthorhombic\nspecimens exhibit this transition at elevated temperatures. In line with\nprevious reports, the temperature at which this structural transition occurs\nscales linearly with the mean ionic radii of the $A$ site ion. However,\nCaBaCo$_{4}$O$_{7}$ which has an equal number of Co${^{2+}}$ and Co${^{3+}}$\nions clearly violates this quasilinear relationship, indicating that charge\nordering could also play a critical role in stabilizing the orthorhombic\ndistortion in this system. Using thermoremanent magnetization measurements to\ncircumvent the problem of the large paramagnetic background arising from\nDy${^{3+}}$ ions, we chart out the phase diagram of the\nDy$_{1-x}$Ca$_{x}$BaCo$_{4}$O$_{7}$ series.\n", "  We present a simulation program for the production of a pair of W bosons in\nassociation with a jet, that can be used in conjunction with general-purpose\nshower Monte Carlo generators, according to the POWHEG method. We have further\nadapted and implemented the MINLO' method on top of the NLO calculation\nunderlying our WW+jet generator. Thus, the resulting simulation achieves NLO\naccuracy not only for inclusive distributions in WW+jet production but also WW\nproduction, i.e. when the associated jet is not resolved, without the\nintroduction of any unphysical merging scale. This work represents the first\nextension of the MINLO' method, in its original form, to the case of a genuine\nunderlying 2->2 process, with non-trivial virtual corrections.\n", "  We present a search for low energy antineutrino events coincident with the\ngravitational wave events GW150914 and GW151226, and the candidate event\nLVT151012 using KamLAND, a kiloton-scale antineutrino detector. We find no\ninverse beta-decay neutrino events within $\\pm 500$ seconds of either\ngravitational wave signal. This non-detection is used to constrain the electron\nantineutrino fluence and the luminosity of the astrophysical sources.\n", "  We demonstrate a coherence time of 2.1(1)~s for electron spin superposition\nstates of a single trapped $^{40}$Ca$^+$ ion. The coherence time, measured with\na spin-echo experiment, corresponds to residual rms magnetic field fluctuations\n$\\leq$~2.7$\\times$10$^{-12}$~T. The suppression of decoherence induced by\nfluctuating magnetic fields is achieved by combining a two-layer $\\mu$-metal\nshield, which reduces external magnetic noise by 20 to 30~dB for frequencies of\n50~Hz to 100~kHz, with Sm$_2$Co$_{17}$ permanent magnets for generating a\nquantizing magnetic field of 0.37~mT. Our results extend the coherence time of\nthe simple-to-operate spin qubit to ultralong coherence times which so far have\nbeen observed only for magnetic insensitive transitions in atomic qubits with\nhyperfine structure.\n", "  The question of how stiff polymers are able to pack into small containers is\nparticularly relevant to the study of DNA packaging in viruses. A reduced\nversion of the problem based on coarse-grained representations of the main\ncomponents of the system -- the DNA polymer and the spherical viral capsid --\nhas been studied by molecular dynamics simulation. The results, involving\nlonger polymers than in earlier work, show that as polymers become more rigid\nthere is an increasing tendency to self-organize as spools that wrap from the\ninside out, rather than the inverse direction seen previously. In the final\nstate, a substantial part of the polymer is packed into one or more coaxial\nspools, concentrically layered with different orientations, a form of packaging\nachievable without twisting the polymer.\n", "  The analytic \"equilibrium model\" for galaxy evolution using a mass balance\nequation is able to reproduce mean observed galaxy scaling relations between\nstellar mass, halo mass, star formation rate (SFR) and metallicity across the\nmajority of cosmic time with a small number of parameters related to feedback.\nHere we aim to test this data-constrained model to quantify deviations from the\nmean relation between stellar mass and SFR, i.e. the star-forming galaxy main\nsequence (MS). We implement fluctuation in halo accretion rates parameterised\nfrom merger-based simulations, and quantify the intrinsic scatter introduced\ninto the MS under the assumption that fluctuations in star formation follow\nbaryonic inflow fluctuations. We predict the 1-sigma MS scatter to be ~ 0.2 -\n0.25 dex over the stellar mass range 10^8 Mo to 10^11 Mo and a redshift range\n0.5 < z < 3 for SFRs averaged over 100 Myr. The scatter increases modestly at z\n> 3, as well as by averaging over shorter timescales. The contribution from\nmerger-induced star formation is generally small, around 5% today and 10 - 15%\nduring the peak epoch of cosmic star formation. These results are generally\nconsistent with available observations, suggesting that deviations from the MS\nprimarily reflect stochasticity in the inflow rate owing to halo mergers.\n", "  It was recently suggested that the merger of $\\sim30\\,M_\\odot$ primordial\nblack holes (PBHs) may provide a significant number of events in\ngravitational-wave observatories over the next decade, if they make up an\nappreciable fraction of the dark matter. Here we show that measurement of the\neccentricities of the inspiralling binary black holes can be used to\ndistinguish these binaries from those produced by more traditional\nastrophysical mechanisms. These PBH binaries are formed on highly eccentric\norbits and can then merge on timescales that in some cases are years or less,\nretaining some eccentricity in the last seconds before the merger. This is to\nbe contrasted with massive-stellar-binary, globular-cluster, or other\nastrophysical origins for binary black holes (BBHs) in which the orbits have\nvery effectively circularized by the time the BBH enters the observable LIGO\nwindow. Here we discuss the features of the gravitational-wave signals that\nindicate this eccentricity and forecast the sensitivity of LIGO and the\nEinstein Telescope to such effects. We show that if PBHs make up the dark\nmatter, then roughly one event should have a detectable eccentricity given\nLIGO's expected sensitivity and observing time of six years. The Einstein\nTelescope should see $O(10)$ such events after ten years.\n", "  In this letter we describe how we use stellar dynamics information to\nconstrain the shape of the stellar IMF in a sample of 27 early-type galaxies\nfrom the CALIFA survey. We obtain dynamical and stellar mass-to-light ratios,\n$\\Upsilon_\\mathrm{dyn}$ and $\\Upsilon_{\\ast}$, over a homogenous aperture of\n0.5~$R_{e}$. We use the constraint $\\Upsilon_\\mathrm{dyn} \\ge \\Upsilon_{\\ast}$\nto test two IMF shapes within the framework of the extended MILES stellar\npopulation models. We rule out a single power law IMF shape for 75% of the\ngalaxies in our sample. Conversely, we find that a double power law IMF shape\nwith a varying high-mass end slope is compatible (within 1$\\sigma$) with 95% of\nthe galaxies. We also show that dynamical and stellar IMF mismatch factors give\nconsistent results for the systematic variation of the IMF in these galaxies.\n", "  We explore universal critical behavior in models with two competing order\nparameters, and an O(N)+O(M) symmetry for dimensions $d \\leq 3$. In d=3, there\nis always exactly one stable Renormalization Group fixed point, corresponding\nto bicritical or tetracritical behavior. Employing novel, pseudo-spectral\ntechniques to solve functional Renormalization Group equations in a\ntwo-dimensional field space, we uncover a more intricate structure of fixed\npoints in d<3, where two additional bicritical fixed points play a role.\nTowards d=2, we discover ranges of N=M with several simultaneously stable fixed\npoints, indicating the coexistence of several universality classes.\n", "  The dispersion relations of magnons in ferromagnetic pyrochlores with\nDzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction is shown to possess Weyl points, i.\\,e.,\npairs of topological nontrivial crossings of two magnon branches with opposite\ntopological charge. As a consequence of their topological nature, their\nprojections onto a surface are connected by magnon arcs, thereby resembling\nclosely Fermi arcs of electronic Weyl semimetals. On top of this, the positions\nof the Weyl points in reciprocal space can be tuned widely by an external\nmagnetic field: rotated within the surface plane, the Weyl points and magnon\narcs are rotated as well; tilting the magnetic field out-of-plane shifts the\nWeyl points toward the center $\\bar{\\Gamma}$ of the surface Brillouin zone. The\ntheory is valid for the class of ferromagnetic pyrochlores, i.\\,e.,\nthree-dimensional extensions of topological magnon insulators on kagome\nlattices. In this Letter, we focus on the $(111)$ surface, identify candidates\nof established ferromagnetic pyrochlores which apply to the considered spin\nmodel, and suggest experiments for the detection of the topological features.\n", "  We construct high order symmetric volume-preserving methods for the\nrelativistic dynamics of a charged particle by the splitting technique with\nprocessing. Via expanding the phase space to include time $t$, we give a more\ngeneral construction of volume-preserving methods that can be applied to\nsystems with time-dependent electromagnetic fields. The newly derived methods\nprovide numerical solutions with good accuracy and conservative properties over\nlong time of simulation. Furthermore, because of the use of processing\ntechnique the high order methods are explicit, and cost less than the methods\nderived from standard compositions, thus are more efficient. The results are\nverified by the numerical experiments. Linear stability analysis of the methods\nshow that the high order processed method allows larger time step size during\nintegration.\n", "  The performance of the jet trigger for the ATLAS detector at the LHC during\nthe 2011 data taking period is described. During 2011 the LHC provided\nproton-proton collisions with a centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV and heavy ion\ncollisions with a 2.76 TeV per nucleon-nucleon collision energy. The ATLAS\ntrigger is a three level system designed to reduce the rate of events from the\n40 MHz nominal maximum bunch crossing rate to the approximate 400 Hz which can\nbe written to offline storage. The ATLAS jet trigger is the primary means for\nthe online selection of events containing jets. Events are accepted by the\ntrigger if they contain one or more jets above some transverse energy\nthreshold. During 2011 data taking the jet trigger was fully efficient for jets\nwith transverse energy above 25 GeV for triggers seeded randomly at Level 1.\nFor triggers which require a jet to be identified at each of the three trigger\nlevels, full efficiency is reached for offline jets with transverse energy\nabove 60 GeV. Jets reconstructed in the Event Filter and corresponding to\noffline jets with transverse energy greater than 60 GeV, are reconstructed with\na resolution in transverse energy of better than 4% in the central region and\nbetter than 2.5% in the forward direction.\n", "  Using the most recent release of the ALEPH $\\tau$ decay data, we present a\nvery detailed phenomenological update of the $\\alpha_s(m_\\tau^2)$\ndetermination. We have exploited the sensitivity to the strong coupling in many\ndifferent ways, exploring several complementary methodologies. All\ndeterminations turn out to be in excellent agreement, allowing us to extract a\nvery reliable value of the strong coupling. We find\n$\\alpha_{s}^{(n_f=3)}(m_\\tau^2) = 0.328 \\pm 0.012$ which implies\n$\\alpha_{s}^{(n_f=5)}(M_Z^{2}) = 0.1197\\pm 0.0014$. We critically revise\nprevious work, and point out the problems flawing some recent analyses which\nclaim slightly smaller values.\n", "  A model of the self-interacting charged massive spin-two field is\nconstructed. We investigate several properties of the model and find that the\ntrivial vacuum is only allowed due to the internal symmetry. This suggests that\nthe Higgs mechanism might not be induced by the model of the massive spin-two\nfield with the ghost-free potential.\n", "  The evolution equations of anomalous magnetohydrodynamics are derived in the\nextreme relativistic regime and contrasted with the treatment of hydromagnetic\nnonlinearities pioneered by Lichnerowicz in the absence of anomalous currents.\nIn particular we explore the situation where the conventional vector currents\nare complemented by the axial-vector currents arising either from the pseudo\nNambu-Goldstone bosons of a spontaneously broken symmetry or because of finite\nfermionic density effects. After expanding the generally covariant equations in\ninverse powers of the conductivity, the relativistic analog of the magnetic\ndiffusivity equation is derived in the presence of vortical and magnetic\ncurrents. While the anomalous contributions are generally suppressed by the\ndiffusivity, they are shown to disappear in the perfectly conducting limit.\nWhen the flow is irrotational, boost-invariant and with vanishing\nfour-acceleration the corresponding evolution equations are explicitly\nintegrated so that the various physical regimes can be directly verified.\n", "  We consider the orbital effect of an in-plane magnetic field on electrons in\nbilayer graphene, deriving linear-in-field contributions to the low-energy\nHamiltonian arising from the presence of either skew interlayer coupling or\ninterlayer potential asymmetry, the latter being tunable by an external\nmetallic gate. To illustrate the relevance of such terms, we consider the\nratchet effect in which a dc current results from the application of an\nalternating electric field in the presence of an in-plane magnetic field and\ninversion-symmetry breaking. By comparison with recent experimental\nobservations in monolayer graphene [C. Drexler et al., Nature Nanotech. 8, 104\n(2013)], we estimate that the effect in bilayer graphene can be two orders of\nmagnitude greater than that in monolayer, illustrating that the bilayer is an\nideal material for the realization of optoelectronic effects that rely on\ninversion-symmetry breaking.\n", "  An analytical solution to the the three-dimensional telegraph equation is\npresented. This equation has recently received some attention but so far the\ntreatment has been one-dimensional. By using the structural similarity to the\nKlein-Gordon equation, the telegraph equation can be solved in closed form.\nIllustrative examples are used to discuss the qualitative differences to the\ndiffusion solution. The comparison with a numerical test-particle simulation\nreveals that some features of an intensity profile can be better explained\nusing the telegraph approach.\n", "  We present a complete study of the associated production of the $\\eta_c$\nmeson with light hadrons in $e^+e^-$ collisions at the B-factory energy, which\nis demonstrated to be one of the best laboratories for testing the colour-octet\n(CO) mechanism. The colour-siglet contributions are evaluated up to\n$O(\\alpha^2\\alpha_s^3)$ while the CO ones are evaluated up to\n$O(\\alpha^2\\alpha_s^2)$. For the first time, the angular distribution of the\n$^1S_0^{[8]}$ production is studied at QCD next-to-leading order. We find that\nthe $^1S_0^{[8]}$ channel dominate the total cross section, while the\n$^1P_1^{[8]}$ one exhibit its importance in the angular distribution, which\nturns out to be downward going with respect to $\\mathrm{cos}\\theta$. This can\nbe considered as the most distinct signal for the CO mechanism.\n", "  We study the spin-flavor structure of the nucleon's chiral-odd generalized\nparton distributions (transversity GPDs) in the large-N_c limit of QCD. In\ncontrast to the chiral-even case, only three combinations of the four\nchiral-odd GPDs are non-zero in the leading order of the 1/N_c expansion:\nE_T-bar = E_T + 2 H_T-tilde, H_T and E_T-tilde. The degeneracy is explained by\nthe absence of spin-orbit interactions correlating the transverse momentum\ntransfer with the transverse quark spin. It can also be deduced from the\nnatural N_c-scaling of the quark-nucleon helicity amplitudes associated with\nthe GPDs. In the GPD E_T-bar the flavor-singlet component u + d is leading in\nthe 1/N_c expansion, while in H_T and E_T-tilde it is the flavor-nonsinglet\ncomponents u - d. The large-N_c relations are consistent with the spin-flavor\nstructure extracted from hard exclusive pi0 and eta electroproduction data, if\nit is assumed that the processes are mediated by twist-3 amplitudes involving\nthe chiral-odd GPDs and the chiral-odd pseudoscalar meson distribution\namplitudes.\n", "  Comparing the luminosity distance measurements to its theoretical predictions\nis one of the cornerstones in establishing the modern cosmology. However, as\nshown in Biern & Yoo, its theoretical predictions in literature are often\nplagued with infrared divergences and gauge-dependences. This trend calls into\nquestion the sanity of the methods used to derive the luminosity distance. Here\nwe critically investigate four different methods --- the geometric approach,\nthe Sachs approach, the Jacobi mapping approach, and the geodesic light cone\n(GLC) approach to modeling the luminosity distance, and we present a unified\ntreatment of such methods, facilitating the comparison among the methods and\nchecking their sanity. All of these four methods, if exercised properly, can be\nused to reproduce the correct description of the luminosity distance.\n", "  We calcuate electronic spin susceptibility and spin-lattice relaxation rate\nin singlet superconductor near a pairbreaking surface, or in a domain wall of\nthe order parameter. We directly link presence of high-density Andreev bound\nstates in the inhomogeneous region, combined with coherence factors, to\nenhancement of the susceptibility above the normal state's value for certain\n$\\bf q$ vectors. Beside the dominant peak at ferromagnetic vector $q=0$, we\nfind significant enhancement of antiferromagnetic correlations at vectors\n$q\\lesssim 2 k_f$, with $\\bf q$ $along$ the domain wall in $S$-wave\nsuperconductor, and $across$ domain wall in $D$-wave (nodes along the wall).\nThese features are destroyed by applying moderate Zeeman field that splits the\nzero-energy peak. We solve Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations in momentum space and\nour results deviate from the lattice models investigated previously. Large\nenhancement of the spin-lattice relaxation rate $T_1^{-1}$ at the domain wall\nprovides clear signature of the quasiparticle bound states, and is in good\nagreement with recent experiment in organic superconductor\n$\\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$Cu(NCS)$_2$.\n", "  The onset of irreversible deformation in low-temperature amorphous solids is\ndue to the accumulation of elementary events, consisting of spacially and\ntemporally localized atomic rearrangements involving only a few tens of atoms.\nRecently, numerical and experimental work addressed the issue of\nspatio-temporal correlations between these plastic events. Here, we provide\nfurther insight into these correlations by investigating, via molecular\ndynamics (MD) simulations, the plastic response of a two-dimensional amorphous\nsolid to artificially triggered local shear transformations. We show that while\nthe plastic response is virtually absent in as-quenched configurations, it\nbecomes apparent if a shear strain was previously imposed on the system.\nPlastic response has a four-fold symmetry which is characteristic of the shear\nstress redistribution following the local transformation. At high shear rate we\nreport evidence for a fluctuation-dissipation relation, connecting plastic\nresponse and correlation, which seems to break down if lower shear rates are\nconsidered.\n", "  We report on the anisotropic expansion of ultracold bosonic dysprosium gases\nat temperatures above quantum degeneracy and develop a quantitative theory to\ndescribe this behavior. The theory expresses the post-expansion aspect ratio in\nterms of temperature and microscopic collisional properties by incorporating\nHartree-Fock mean-field interactions, hydrodynamic effects, and\nBose-enhancement factors. Our results extend the utility of expansion imaging\nby providing accurate thermometry for dipolar thermal Bose gases, reducing\nerror in expansion thermometry from tens of percent to only a few percent.\nFurthermore, we present a simple method to determine scattering lengths in\ndipolar gases, including near a Feshbach resonance, through observation of\nthermal gas expansion.\n", "  We discuss why, in the determination of $\\alpha_s(m_{\\tau}^2)$ from hadronic\n$\\tau$ decays, two important assumptions made in most of previous analyses,\nnamely the neglect of higher-dimension condensates and of Duality Violations\n(DVs), have introduced uncontrolled systematic errors into this determination.\nAlthough the use of pinched weights is usually offered as a justification of\nthese assumptions, we explain why it is not possible to simultaneously suppress\nthese two contributions; particularly since the Operator Product Expansion is\nexpected to be an asymptotic, rather than a convergent expansion. There is not\nonly experimental and theoretical evidence for DVs, but they also affect the\nextraction of $\\alpha_s(m_{\\tau}^2)$.\n", "  We propose a model of gravity in which a General Relativity metric tensor and\nan effective metric generated from a single scalar formulated in Geometric\nScalar Gravity are mixed. We show that the model yields the exact Schwarzschild\nsolution, along with accelerating behavior of scale factors in cosmological\nsolutions.\n", "  High-redshift radio galaxies present signs of both star formation and AGN\nactivity, making them ideal candidates to investigate the connection and\ncoevolution of AGN and star formation in the progenitors of present-day massive\ngalaxies. We make use of a sample of 11 powerful radio galaxies spanning 1<z<4\nwhich have complete coverage of their spectral energy distribution (SED) from\nUV to FIR wavelengths. Using Herschel data, we disentangle the relative\ncontribution of the AGN and star formation by combining the\ngalaxyevolutioncodePEGASE.3 with an AGN torus model. We find that three\ncomponents are necessary to reproduce the observed SEDs: an evolved and massive\nstellar component, a submm bright young starburst, and an AGN torus. We find\nthat powerful radio galaxies form at very high-redshift, but experience\nepisodic and important growth at 1<z<4 as the mass of the associated starburst\nvaries from 5 to 50% of the total mass of the system. The properties of star\nformation differ from source to source, indicating no general trend of the star\nformation properties in the most infrared luminous high-redshift radio galaxies\nand no correlation with the AGN bolometric luminosity. Moreover, we find that\nAGN scattered light have a very limited impact on broad-band SED fitting on our\nsample. Finally, our analysis also suggests a wide range in origins for the\nobserved star formation,which we partially constrain for some sources.\n", "  The explicit breaking of chiral symmetry of the Wilson fermion action results\nin additive quark mass renormalization. Moreover, flavour singlet and\nnon-singlet scalar currents acquire different renormalization constants with\nrespect to continuum regularization schemes. This complicates keeping the\nrenormalized strange quark mass fixed when varying the light quark mass in\nsimulations with $N_f=2+1$ sea quark flavours. Here we present and validate our\nstrategy within the CLS (Coordinated Lattice Simulations) effort to achieve\nthis in simulations with non-perturbatively order-$a$ improved Wilson fermions.\nWe also determine various combinations of renormalization constants and\nimprovement coefficients.\n", "  In the perspective of developing smart hybrid materials with customized\nfeatures, ferrogels and magnetorheological elastomers allow a synergy of\nelasticity and magnetism. The interplay between elastic and magnetic properties\ngives rise to a unique reversible control of the material behavior by applying\nan external magnetic field. Albeit few works have been performed on the\ntime-dependent properties so far, understanding the dynamic behavior is the key\nto model many practical situations, e.g. applications as vibration absorbers.\nHere we present a way to calculate the frequency-dependent elastic moduli based\non the decomposition of the linear response to an external stress in normal\nmodes. We use a minimal three-dimensional dipole-spring model to theoretically\ndescribe the magnetic and elastic interactions on the mesoscopic level.\nSpecifically, the magnetic particles carry permanent magnetic dipole moments\nand are spatially arranged in a prescribed way, before they are linked by\nelastic springs. An external magnetic field aligns the magnetic moments. On the\none hand, we study regular lattice-like particle arrangements to compare with\nprevious results in the literature. On the other hand, we calculate the dynamic\nelastic moduli for irregular, more realistic particle distributions. Our\napproach measures the tunability of the linear dynamic response as a function\nof the particle arrangement, the system orientation with respect to the\nexternal magnetic field, as well as the magnitude of the magnetic interaction\nbetween the particles. The strength of the present approach is that it\nexplicitly connects the relaxational modes of the system with the rheological\nproperties as well as with the internal rearrangement of the particles in the\nsample, providing new insight into the dynamics of these remarkable materials.\n", "  Andromeda II (And II) has been known for a few decades but only recently\nobservations have unveiled new properties of this dwarf spheroidal galaxy. The\npresence of two stellar populations, the bimodal star formation history (SFH)\nand an unusual rotation velocity of And II put strong constrains on its\nformation and evolution. Following Lokas et al. (2014), we propose a detailed\nmodel to explain the main properties of And II involving (1) a gas-rich major\nmerger between two dwarf galaxies at high redshift in the field and (2) a close\ninteraction with M31 about 5 Gyr ago. The model is based on\nN-body/hydrodynamical simulations including gas dynamics, star formation and\nfeedback. One simulation is designed to reproduce the gas-rich major merger\nexplaining the origin of stellar populations and the SFH. Other simulations are\nused to study the effects of tidal forces and the ram pressure stripping during\nthe interaction between And II and M31. The model successfully reproduces the\nSFH of And II including the properties of stellar populations, its morphology,\nkinematics and the lack of gas. Further improvements to the model are possible\nvia joint modelling of all processes and better treatment of baryonic physics.\n", "  We study the radiative symmetry breaking of B-L in supersymmetric models with\ninverse seesaw mechanism. We show that for a wide region of parameter space the\nradiative corrections can drive the squared mass of the extra Higgs boson from\npositive initial values at the GUT scale to negative values at the TeV scale,\nleading to the spontaneous breaking of the B-L symmetry. We also emphasize that\nin this class of models, unlike the supersymmetric B-L models with type I\nseesaw, the right-handed sneutrino cannot get a non-zero vacuum expectation\nvalue. Therefore, B-L can be radiatively broken while R-parity remains an exact\nsymmetry.\n", "  Multifocal lens, which focus incident light at multiple foci, are widely used\nin imaging systems and optical communications. However, for the traditional\ndesign strategy, it combines several lenses that have different focal points\ninto a planar integrated unit, resulting a low imaging quality due to the high\nbackground noise. Here, we propose two kinds of multifocal metalens with Au\nnanoslits arranged in an elliptical and a hyperbolic shape, which are able to\neffectively focus incident light at all of the foci with constructive\ninterference, and extremely decrease the background noise and improve the lens\nimaging performance at the nanoscale. We further demonstrate that, the proposed\nmetalens can possess a broadband operation wavelength changed from 600 nm to\n900 nm, with its dual-polarity actively controlled by the incident circular\npolarization lights. With great agreement between the experimental and\nsimulation results, our proposed conic-shaped metalens provides a significant\npotential for the future integrated nanophotonic device.\n", "  We have developed the deposition technology of WSi thin films 4 to 9 nm thick\nwith high temperature values of superconducting transition (Tc~4 K). Based on\ndeposed films there were produced nanostructures with indicative planar sizes\n~100 nm, and the research revealed that even on nanoscale the films possess of\nhigh critical temperature values of the superconducting transition (Tc~3.3-3.7K\n) which certifies high quality and homogeneity of the films created. The first\nexperiments on creating superconducting single-photon detectors showed that the\ndetectors SDE (system detection efficiency) with increasing bias current (Ib)\nreaches a constant value of ~30% (for 1550 nm) defined by infrared radiation\nabsorption by the superconducting structure. To enhance radiation absorption by\nthe superconductor there were created detectors with cavity structures which\ndemonstrated a practically constant value of quantum efficiency >65% for bias\ncurrents Ib>=0.6Ic. The minimal dark counts level (DC) made 1 s^-1 limited with\nbackground noise. Hence WSi is the most promising material for creating\nsingle-photon detectors with record SDE/DC ratio and noise equivalent power\n(NEP).\n", "  The energy-dependent cross section of the 7Be(n,alpha)4He reaction, of\ninterest for the so-called Cosmological Lithium Problem in Big Bang\nNucleosynthesis, has been measured for the first time from 10 meV to 10 keV\nneutron energy. The challenges posed by the short half-life of 7Be and by the\nlow reaction cross section have been overcome at n_TOF thanks to an\nunprecedented combination of the extremely high luminosity and good resolution\nof the neutron beam in the new experimental area (EAR2) of the n_TOF facility\nat CERN, the availability of a sufficient amount of chemically pure 7Be, and a\nspecifically designed experimental setup. Coincidences between the two\nalpha-particles have been recorded in two Si-7Be-Si arrays placed directly in\nthe neutron beam. The present results are consistent, at thermal neutron\nenergy, with the only previous measurement performed in the 60's at a nuclear\nreactor. The energy dependence here reported clearly indicates the inadequacy\nof the cross section estimates currently used in BBN calculations. Although new\nmeasurements at higher neutron energy may still be needed, the n_TOF results\nhint to a minor role of this reaction in BBN, leaving the long-standing\nCosmological Lithium problem unsolved.\n", "  SrTiO3 plays a central role in oxide electronics. It is the substrate of\nchoice for functional oxide heterostructures based on perovskite-structure\nthin-film stacks, and its surface or interface with a polar oxide such as\nLaAlO3 can become a two-dimensional conductor because of electronic\nreconstruction or the presence of oxygen defects. Inconsistent reports of\nmagnetic order in SrTiO3 abound in the literature. Here we report a systematic\nexperimental study aimed at establishing how and when SrTiO3 can develop a\nmagnetic moment at room temperature. Polished 100, 110 or 111 crystal slices\nfrom four different suppliers are characterized before and after vacuum\nannealing at 750 {\\deg}C, both in single-crystal and powdered form. Impurity\ncontent is analysed at the surface and in the bulk. Besides the underlying\nintrinsic diamagnetism of SrTiO3, magnetic signals are of three types-a Curie\nlaw susceptibility due to dilute magnetic impurities at the ppm level, a\nhysteretic, temperature-dependent ferromagnetic impurity contribution, and a\npractically-anhysteretic, defect-related temperature-independent component that\nsaturates in about 200 mT. The latter component is intrinsic. It is often the\nlargest, reaching 10 Bohr magnetons per nm2 of surface area or more and\ndominating the magnetic response in low fields at room temperature. It is\nassociated with defects near the surface, and can be destroyed by treatment\nwith Tiron (C6H4Na2O8S2), an electron donor molecule that forms a strong\ncomplex with titanium at the surface. The origin of this unusual\nhigh-temperature ferromagnetic-like response is discussed.\n", "  We report on the first fully differential calculation for double Higgs boson\nproduction through gluon fusion in hadron collisions up to\nnext-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in QCD perturbation theory. The\ncalculation is performed in the heavy-top limit of the Standard Model, and in\nthe phenomenological results we focus on pp collisions at 14 TeV. We present\ndifferential distributions through NNLO for various observables including the\ntransverse-momentum and rapidity distributions of the two Higgs bosons. NNLO\ncorrections are at the level of 10%-25% with respect to the next-to-leading\norder (NLO) prediction with a residual scale uncertainty of 5%-15% and an\noverall mild phase-space dependence. Only at NNLO the perturbative expansion\nstarts to converge yielding overlapping scale uncertainty bands between NNLO\nand NLO in most of the phase-space. The calculation includes NLO predictions\nfor pp -> HH+jet+X. Corrections to the corresponding distributions exceed 50%\nwith a residual scale dependence of 20%-30%.\n", "  Living microorganisms are capable of a tactic response to external stimuli by\nswimming towards or away from the stimulus source; they do so by adapting their\ntactic signal transduction pathways to the environment. Their self-motility\nthus allows them to swim against a traveling tactic wave, whereas a simple\nfore-rear asymmetry argument would suggest the opposite. Their biomimetic\ncounterpart, the artificial microswimmers, also propel themselves by harvesting\nkinetic energy from an active medium, but, in contrast, lack the adaptive\ncapacity. Here we investigate the transport of artificial swimmers subject to\ntraveling active waves and show, by means of analytical and numerical methods,\nthat self-propelled particles can actually diffuse in either direction with\nrespect to the wave, depending on its speed and waveform. Moreover, chiral\nswimmers, which move along spiraling trajectories, may diffuse preferably in a\ndirection perpendicular to the active wave. Such a variety of tactic responses\nis explained by the modulation of the swimmer's diffusion inside traveling\nactive pulses.\n", "  We review the spectrum and electromagnetic properties of baryons described as\nrelativistic three-quark bound states within QCD. The composite nature of\nbaryons results in a rich excitation spectrum, whilst leading to highly\nnon-trivial structural properties explored by the coupling to external\n(electromagnetic and other) currents. Both present many unsolved problems\ndespite decades of experimental and theoretical research. We discuss the\nprogress in these fields from a theoretical perspective, focusing on\nnonperturbative QCD as encoded in the functional approach via Dyson-Schwinger\nand Bethe-Salpeter equations. We give a systematic overview as to how results\nare obtained in this framework and explain technical connections to lattice\nQCD. We also discuss the mutual relations to the quark model, which still\nserves as a reference to distinguish 'expected' from 'unexpected' physics. We\nconfront recent results on the spectrum of non-strange and strange baryons,\ntheir form factors and the issues of two-photon processes and Compton\nscattering determined in the Dyson-Schwinger framework with those of lattice\nQCD and the available experimental data. The general aim is to identify the\nunderlying physical mechanisms behind the plethora of observable phenomena in\nterms of the underlying quark and gluon degrees of freedom.\n", "  We present a numerical path-integral iteration scheme for the low dimensional\nreduced density matrix of a time-dependent quantum dissipative system. Our\napproach simultaneously accounts for the combined action of a microscopically\nmodelled pure-dephasing type coupling to a continuum of harmonic oscillators\nrepresenting, e.g., phonons, and further environmental interactions inducing\nnon-Hamiltonian dynamics in the inner system represented, e.g., by Lindblad\ntype dissipation or relaxation. Our formulation of the path-integral method\nallows for a numerically exact treatment of the coupling to the oscillator\nmodes and moreover is general enough to provide a natural way to include\nMarkovian processes that are sufficiently described by rate equations. We apply\nthis new formalism to a model of a single semiconductor quantum dot which\nincludes the coupling to longitudinal acoustic phonons for two cases: a)\nexternal laser excitation taking into account a phenomenological radiative\ndecay of the excited dot state and b) a coupling of the quantum dot to a single\nmode of an optical cavity taking into account cavity photon losses.\n", "  The exploration of the phase diagram of a minimal model for barchan fields\nleads to the description of three distinct phases for the system: stationary,\npercolable and unstable. In the stationary phase the system always reaches an\nout of equilibrium, fluctuating, stationary state, independent of its initial\nconditions. This state has a large and continuous range of dynamics, from\ndilute -- where dunes do not interact -- to dense, where the system exhibits\nboth spatial structuring and collective behavior leading to the selection of a\nparticular size for the dunes. In the percolable phase, the system presents a\npercolation threshold when the initial density increases. This percolation is\nunusual, as it happens on a continuous space for moving, interacting, finite\nlifetime dunes. For extreme parameters, the system exhibits a sub-critical\ninstability, where some of the dunes in the field grow without bound. We\ndiscuss the nature of the asymptotic states and their relations to well-known\nmodels of statistical physics.\n", "  The `Rayleigh line' $\\mu=\\eta^2$, where $\\mu=\\Omega_o/\\Omega_i$ and\n$\\eta=r_i/r_o$ are respectively the rotation and radius ratios between inner\n(subscript `i') and outer (subscript `o') cylinders, is regarded as marking the\nlimit of centrifugal instability (CI) in unstratified inviscid Taylor-Couette\nflow, for both axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric modes. Non-axisymmetric\nstratorotational instability (SRI) is known to set in for anticyclonic rotation\nratios beyond that line, i.e. $\\eta^2<\\mu<1$ for axially stably-stratified\nTaylor-Couette flow, but the competition between CI and SRI in the range\n$\\mu<\\eta^2$ has not yet been addressed. In this paper, we establish continuous\nconnections between the two instabilities at finite Reynolds number Re, as\npreviously suggested by M. Le Bars & P. Le Gal, Phys. Rev. Lett. 99, 064502\n(2007), making them indistinguishable at onset. Both instabilities are also\ncontinuously connected to the radiative instability at finite Re. These results\ndemonstrate the complex impact viscosity has on the linear stability properties\nof this flow. Several other qualitative differences with inviscid theory were\nfound, among which the instability of a non-axisymmetric mode localized at the\nouter cylinder without stratification, and the instability of a mode\npropagating against the inner cylinder rotation with stratification. The\ncombination of viscosity and stratification can also lead to a `collision'\nbetween (axisymmetric) Taylor vortex branches, causing the axisymmetric\noscillatory state already observed in past experiments. Perhaps more surprising\nis the instability of a centrifugal-like helical mode beyond the Rayleigh line,\ncaused by the joint effects of stratification and viscosity. The threshold\n$\\mu=\\eta^2$ seems to remain, however, an impassable instability limit for\naxisymmetric modes, regardless of stratification, viscosity, and even\ndisturbance amplitude.\n", "  We study the physics reach of the long-baseline oscillation analysis of the\nDUNE experiment when realistic simulations are used to estimate its neutrino\nenergy reconstruction capabilities. Our studies indicate that significant\nimprovements in energy resolution compared to what is customarily assumed are\nplausible. This improved energy resolution can increase the sensitivity to\nleptonic CP violation in two ways. On the one hand, the CP-violating term in\nthe oscillation probability has a characteristic energy dependence that can be\nbetter reproduced. On the other hand, the second oscillation maximum,\nespecially sensitive to $\\delta_{CP}$, is better reconstructed. These effects\nlead to a significant improvement in the fraction of values of $\\delta_{CP}$\nfor which a $5 \\sigma$ discovery of leptonic CP-violation would be possible.\nThe precision of the $\\delta_{CP}$ measurement could also be greatly enhanced,\nwith a reduction of the maximum uncertainties from $26^\\circ$ to $18^\\circ$ for\na 300~MW$\\cdot$kt$\\cdot$yr exposure. We therefore believe that this potential\ngain in physics reach merits further investigations of the detector performance\nachievable in DUNE.\n", "  We present EVEREST, an open-source pipeline for removing instrumental noise\nfrom K2 light curves. EVEREST employs a variant of pixel level decorrelation\n(PLD) to remove systematics introduced by the spacecraft's pointing error and a\nGaussian process (GP) to capture astrophysical variability. We apply EVEREST to\nall K2 targets in campaigns 0-7, yielding light curves with precision\ncomparable to that of the original Kepler mission for stars brighter than $K_p\n\\approx 13$, and within a factor of two of the Kepler precision for fainter\ntargets. We perform cross-validation and transit injection and recovery tests\nto validate the pipeline, and compare our light curves to the other de-trended\nlight curves available for download at the MAST High Level Science Products\narchive. We find that EVEREST achieves the highest average precision of any of\nthese pipelines for unsaturated K2 stars. The improved precision of these light\ncurves will aid in exoplanet detection and characterization, investigations of\nstellar variability, asteroseismology, and other photometric studies. The\nEVEREST pipeline can also easily be applied to future surveys, such as the TESS\nmission, to correct for instrumental systematics and enable the detection of\nlow signal-to-noise transiting exoplanets. The EVEREST light curves and the\nsource code used to generate them are freely available online.\n", "  The action for a massless particle in 4D Minkowski space has a worldline\ntime-reversing symmetry corresponding to CPT invariance of the quantum theory.\nThe analogous symmetry of the N-extended superparticle is shown to be anomalous\nwhen N is odd, in the supertwistor formalism this is because a CPT-violating\nworldline-Chern-Simons term is needed to preserve the chiral U(1) gauge\ninvariance. This accords with the fact that no massless N=1 super-Poincar\\'e\nirrep is CPT-self-conjugate. There is a CPT self-conjugate supermultiplet when\nN is even, but it has $2^{N+1}$ states when N/2 is odd (e.g. the N=2\nhypermultiplet) in contrast to just $2^N$ when N/2 is even (e.g. the N=4\nMaxwell supermultiplet). This is shown to follow from a Kramers degeneracy of\nthe superparticle state space when N/2 is odd.\n", "  The ion-ion interactions become exponentially screened for ions confined in\nultranarrow metallic pores. To study the phase behaviour of an assembly of such\nions, called a superionic liquid, we develop a statistical theory formulated on\nbipartite lattices, which allows an analytical solution within the\nBethe-lattice approach. Our solution predicts the existence of ordered and\ndisordered phases in which ions form a crystal-like structure and a homogeneous\nmixture, respectively. The transition between these two phases can potentially\nbe first or second order, depending on the ion diameter, degree of confinement\nand pore ionophobicity. We supplement our analytical results by\nthree-dimensional off-lattice Monte Carlo simulations of an ionic liquid in\nslit nanopores. The simulations predict formation of ionic clusters and ordered\nsnake-like patterns, leading to characteristic close-standing peaks in the\ncation-cation and anion-anion radial distribution functions.\n", "  One of the defining properties of an open quantum system is the variation of\nits purity in time. We derive speed limits on the rate of purity change for\nsystems coupled to a Markovian environment. Our speed limits are based on\nLiouville space where density matrices are represented as vectors. This\napproach leads to speed limits that are always tighter compared to their\nparallel speed limits in Hilbert space. These bounds depend solely on the\ngenerators of the nonunitary dynamics and are independent of the particular\nstates of the systems. Thus, they are perfectly suited to investigate\ndephasing, thermalization, and decorrelation processes of arbitrary states. We\nshow that our speed limits can be attained and are therefore tight. As an\napplication of our results we study correlation loss, and the speed of\nclassical and quantum correlation erasure in multi-particle system.\n", "  This Letter reports an improved search for light sterile neutrino mixing in\nthe electron antineutrino disappearance channel with the full configuration of\nthe Daya Bay Reactor Neutrino Experiment. With an additional 404 days of data\ncollected in eight antineutrino detectors, this search benefits from 3.6 times\nthe statistics available to the previous publication, as well as from\nimprovements in energy calibration and background reduction. A relative\ncomparison of the rate and energy spectrum of reactor antineutrinos in the\nthree experimental halls yields no evidence of sterile neutrino mixing in the\n$2\\times10^{-4} \\lesssim |\\Delta m^{2}_{41}| \\lesssim 0.3$ eV$^{2}$ mass range.\nThe resulting limits on $\\sin^{2}2\\theta_{14}$ are improved by approximately a\nfactor of 2 over previous results and constitute the most stringent constraints\nto date in the $|\\Delta m^{2}_{41}| \\lesssim 0.2$ eV$^{2}$ region.\n", "  Under the presence of anisotropic sources in the inflationary era, the\ntrispectrum of the primordial curvature perturbation has a very specific\nangular dependence between each wavevector that is distinguishable from the one\nencountered when only scalar fields are present, characterized by an angular\ndependence described by Legendre polynomials. We examine the imprints left by\ncurvature trispectra on the $TT\\mu$ bispectrum, generated by the correlation\nbetween temperature anisotropies (T) and chemical potential spectral\ndistortions ($\\mu$) of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). Due to the\nangular dependence of the primordial signal, the corresponding $TT\\mu$\nbispectrum strongly differs in shape from $TT\\mu$ sourced by the usual $g_{\\rm\nNL}$ or $\\tau_{\\rm NL}$ local trispectra, enabling us to obtain an unbiased\nestimation. From a Fisher matrix analysis, we find that, in a\ncosmic-variance-limited (CVL) survey of $TT\\mu$, a minimum detectable value of\nthe quadrupolar Legendre coefficient is $d_2 \\sim 0.01$, which is 4 orders of\nmagnitude better than the best value attainable from the $TTTT$ CMB\ntrispectrum. In the case of an anisotropic inflationary model with a\n$f(\\phi)F^2$ interaction (coupling the inflaton field $\\phi$ with a vector\nkinetic term $F^2$), the size of the curvature trispectrum is related to that\nof quadrupolar power spectrum asymmetry, $g_*$. In this case, a CVL measurement\nof $TT\\mu$ makes it possible to measure $g_*$ down to $10^{-3}$.\n", "  We present a scenario where a $Z_2$-symmetric scalar field $\\phi$ first\ndrives cosmic inflation, then reheats the Universe but remains\nout-of-equilibrium itself, and finally comprises the observed dark matter\nabundance, produced by particle decays \\`{a} la freeze-in mechanism. We work\nmodel-independently without specifying the interactions of the scalar field\nbesides its self-interaction coupling, $\\lambda\\phi^4$, non-minimal coupling to\ngravity, $\\xi\\phi^2R$, and coupling to another scalar field, $g\\phi^2\\sigma^2$.\nWe find the scalar field $\\phi$ serves both as the inflaton and a dark matter\ncandidate if $10^{-9}\\lesssim \\lambda\\lesssim g\\lesssim 10^{-7}$ and $3\n\\rm{keV} \\lesssim m_{\\rm \\phi}\\lesssim 85 \\rm{MeV}$ for $\\xi=\\mathcal{O}(1)$.\nSuch a small value of the non-minimal coupling is also found to be of the right\nmagnitude to produce the observed curvature perturbation amplitude within the\nscenario. We also discuss how the model may be distinguished from other\ninflationary models of the same type by the next generation CMB satellites.\n", "  The leading order dynamics of the type IIB Large Volume Scenario is\ncharacterised by the interplay between $\\alpha'$ and non-perturbative effects\nwhich fix the overall volume and all local blow-up modes leaving (in general)\nseveral flat directions. In this paper we show that, in an arbitrary Calabi-Yau\nwith at least one blow-up mode resolving a point-like singularity, any\nremaining flat directions can be lifted at subleading order by the inclusions\nof higher derivative $\\alpha'$ corrections. We then focus on simple fibred\ncases with one remaining flat direction which can behave as an inflaton if its\npotential is generated by both higher derivative $\\alpha'$ and winding loop\ncorrections. Natural values of the underlying parameters give a spectral index\nin agreement with observational data and a tensor-to-scalar ratio of order\n$r=0.01$ which could be observed by forthcoming CMB experiments. Dangerous\ncorrections from higher dimensional operators are suppressed due to the\npresence of an approximate non-compact shift symmetry.\n", "  We investigate novel transport phenomena in a chiral fluid originated from an\ninterplay between a vorticity and strong magnetic field, which induces a\nredistribution of vector charges in the system and an axial current along the\nmagnetic field. The corresponding transport coefficients are obtained from an\nenergy-shift argument for the chiral fermions in the lowest Landau level (LLL)\ndue to a spin-vorticity coupling and also from diagrammatic computations on the\nbasis of the linear response theory. Based on consistent results from the both\nmethods, we observe that the transport coefficients are proportional to the\nanomaly coefficient and are independent of temperature and chemical potential.\nWe therefore speculate that these transport phenomena are connected to quantum\nanomaly.\n", "  We show that in the perturbative regime defined by the coupling constant, the\ntheta-exact Seiberg-Witten map applied to noncommutative U(N) Yang-Mills --with\nor without Supersymmetry-- gives an ordinary gauge theory which is, at the\nquantum level, dual to the former. We do so by using the on-shell DeWitt\neffective action and dimensional regularization. We explicitly compute the\none-loop two-point function contribution to the on-shell DeWitt effective\naction of the ordinary U(1) theory furnished by the theta-exact Seiberg-Witten\nmap. We find that the non-local UV divergences found in the propagator in the\nFeynman gauge all but disappear, so that they are not physically relevant. We\nalso show that the quadratic noncommutative IR divergences are gauge-fixing\nindependent and go away in the Supersymmetric version of the U(1) theory.\n", "  Introduction of spin-orbit interaction (SOI) into graphene with weak\nhydrogenation ($\\sim$0.1\\%) by dissociation of hydrogen silsesquioxane resist\nhas been confirmed through the appearance of inverse spin Hall effect. The spin\ncurrent was produced by spin injection from permalloy electrodes excluding\nnon-spin relating experimental artifact.\n", "  Classical density functional theory is applied to investigate the validity of\na phenomenological force-balance description of the stability of the Cassie\nstate of liquids on substrates with nanoscale corrugation. A bulk free-energy\nfunctional of third order in local density is combined with a square-gradient\nterm, describing the liquid-vapor interface. The bulk free energy is\nparameterized to reproduce the liquid density and the compressibility of water.\nThe square-gradient term is adjusted to model the width of the water-vapor\ninterface. The substrate is modeled by an external potential, based upon\nLennard-Jones interactions. The three-dimensional calculation focuses on\nsubstrates patterned with nanostripes and square-shaped nanopillars. Using both\nthe force-balance relation and density-functional theory, we locate the\nCassie-to-Wenzel transition as a function of the corrugation parameters. We\ndemonstrate that the force-balance relation gives a qualitatively reasonable\ndescription of the transition even on the nanoscale. The force balance utilizes\nan effective contact angle between the fluid and the vertical wall of the\ncorrugation to parameterize the impalement pressure. This effective angle is\nfound to have values smaller than the Young contact angle. This observation\ncorresponds to an impalement pressure that is smaller than the value predicted\nby macroscopic theory. Therefore, this effective angle embodies effects\nspecific to nanoscopically corrugated surfaces, including the finite range of\nthe liquid-solid potential (which has both repulsive and attractive parts),\nline tension, and the finite interface thickness. Consistently with this\npicture, both patterns (stripes and pillars) yield the same effective contact\nangles for large periods of corrugation.\n", "  We study possible string theory compactifications which, in the low-energy\nlimit, describe chaotic inflation with a stabilizer field. We first analyze\ntype IIA setups where the inflationary potential arises from a D6-brane\nwrapping an internal three-cycle, and where the stabilizer field is either an\nopen-string or bulk K\\\"ahler modulus. We find that after integrating out the\nrelevant closed-string moduli consistently, tachyonic directions arise during\ninflation which cannot be lifted. This is ultimately due to the shift\nsymmetries of the type IIA K\\\"ahler potential at large compactification volume.\nThis motivates us to search for stabilizer candidates in the complex structure\nsector of type IIB orientifolds, since these fields couple to D7-brane Wilson\nlines and their shift symmetries are generically broken away from the large\ncomplex structure limit. However, we find that in these setups the challenge is\nto obtain the necessary hierarchy between the inflationary and Kaluza-Klein\nscales.\n", "  Associated with spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and inversion symmetry breaking,\nRashba spin polarization opens a new avenue for spintronic applications that\nwas previously limited to ordinary magnets. However, spin polarization effects\nin actual Rashba systems are far more complicated than what conventional\nsingle-orbital models would suggest. By studying via first-principles DFT and a\nmulti-orbital k.p model a 3D bulk Rashba system (free of complications by\nsurface effects) we find that the physical origin of the leading spin\npolarization effects is SOC-induced hybridization between spin and multiple\norbitals, especially those with nonzero orbital angular momenta. In this\nframework we establish a general understanding of the orbital mapping, common\nto the surface of topological insulators and Rashba system. Consequently, the\nintrinsic mechanism of various spin polarization effects, which pertain to all\nRashba systems even those with global inversion symmetry, is understood as a\nmanifestation of the orbital textures. This finding suggests a route for\ndesigning high spin-polarization materials by considering the atomic-orbital\ncontent.\n", "  We develop a new Monte-Carlo-based method to convert the SDSS (Sloan Digital\nSky Survey) $u$-band magnitude to the SCUSS (South Galactic Cap of $u$-band Sky\nSurvey) $u$-band magnitude. Due to more accuracy of SCUSS $u$-band\nmeasurements, the converted $u$-band magnitude becomes more accurate comparing\nwith the original SDSS $u$-band magnitude, in particular at the faint end. The\naverage $u$ (both SDSS and SCUSS) magnitude error of numerous main-sequence\nstars with $0.2<g-r<0.8$ increase as $g$-band magnitude becomes fainter. When\n$g=19.5$, the average magnitude error of SDSS $u$ is 0.11. When $g=20.5$, the\naverage SDSS $u$ error is up to 0.22. However, at this magnitude, the average\nmagnitude error of SCUSS $u$ is just half as much as that of SDSS $u$. The SDSS\n$u$-band magnitudes of main-sequence stars with $0.2<g-r<0.8$ and $18.5<g<20.5$\nare converted, therefore the maximum average error of converted $u$-band\nmagnitudes is 0.11. The potential application of this conversion is to derive\nmore accurate photometric metallicity calibration from SDSS observation,\nespecially for those distant stars. Thus, we can explore stellar metallicity\ndistributions either in the Galactic halo or some stream stars.\n", "  We explore the potential for the discovery of a dilaton\n$\\mathcal{O}(200-500)$ GeV in a classical scale/conformal invariant extension\nof the Standard Model by investigating the size of the corresponding breaking\nscale $\\Lambda$ at the LHC, extending a previous analysis. In particular, we\naddress the recent bounds on $\\Lambda$ derived from Higgs boson searches. We\ninvestigate if such a dilaton can be produced via gluon-gluon fusion,\npresenting rates for its decay either into a pair of Higgs bosons or into two\nheavy gauge bosons, which can give rise to multi-leptonic final states. A\ndetailed analysis via PYTHIA-FastJet has been carried out of the dominant\nStandard Model backgrounds, at a centre of mass energy of 14 TeV. We show that\nearly data of $\\sim 20$ fb$^{-1}$ can certainly probe the region of parameter\nspace where such a dilaton is allowed. A conformal scale of 5 TeV is allowed by\nthe current data, for almost all values of the dilaton mass investigated.\n", "  An exhaustive number of QCD finite energy sum rules for $\\tau$-decay together\nwith the latest updated ALEPH data is used to test the assumption of global\nduality. Typical checks are the absence of the dimension $d=2$ condensate, the\nequality of the gluon condensate extracted from vector or axial vector spectral\nfunctions, the Weinberg sum rules, the chiral condensates of dimensions $d=6$\nand $d=8$, as well as the extraction of some low-energy parameters of chiral\nperturbation theory. Suitable pinched linear integration kernels are introduced\nin the sum rules in order to suppress potential quark-hadron duality violations\nand experimental errors. We find no compelling indications of duality\nviolations in hadronic $\\tau$-decay in the kinematic region above $s\\simeq2.2$\nGeV$^{2}$ for these kernels.\n", "  Recently, Daylan et al. (2014) show that the GeV gamma-ray excess signal from\nthe central Milky Way can be explained by the annihilation of $\\sim 40$ GeV\ndark matter through $b\\bar{b}$ channel. Based on the morphology of the\ngamma-ray flux, the best-fit inner slope of the dark matter density profile is\n$\\gamma=1.26$. However, recent analyses of Milky Way dark matter profile favor\n$\\gamma=0.6-0.8$. In this article, we show that the GeV gamma-ray excess can\nalso be explained by the Sommerfeld-enhanced dark matter annihilation through\n$b\\bar{b}$ channel with $\\gamma=0.85-1.05$. We constrain the parameters of the\nSommerfeld-enhanced annihilation by using the data from Fermi-LAT. We also show\nthat the predicted gamma-ray fluxes emitted from dwarf galaxies generally\nsatisfy the recent upper limits of gamma-ray fluxes detected by Fermi-LAT.\n", "  In this work, we aim to contribute to the understanding of the human\npro-social behavior by studying the influence that a particular form of social\npressure \"being watched\" has on the evolution of cooperative behavior. We study\nhow cooperation emerge in multiplex complex topologies by analyzing a\nparticular bidirectionally-coupled dynamics on top of a two-layers multiplex\nnetwork (duplex). The coupled dynamics appears between the Prisoner's Dilemma\ngame in a network, and a threshold cascade model in the other. The threshold\nmodel is intended to abstract the behavior of a network of vigilant nodes, that\nimpose pressure of being observed altering hence the temptation to defect of\nthe dilemma. Cooperation or defection in the game also affects the state of a\nnode of being vigilant. We analyze these processes on different duplex networks\nstructures and assess the influence of the topology, average degree and\ncorrelated multiplexity, on the outcome of cooperation. Interestingly, we find\nthat the social pressure of vigilance may impact cooperation positively or\nnegatively, depending on the duplex structure, specifically the degree\ncorrelations between layers is determinant. Our results give further\nquantitative insights in the promotion of cooperation under social pressure.\n", "  Massive stars are extremely luminous and drive strong winds, blowing a large\npart of their matter into the galactic environment before they finally explode\nas a supernova. Quantitative knowledge of massive star feedback is required to\nunderstand our Universe as we see it. Traditionally, massive stars have been\nstudied under the assumption that their winds are homogeneous and stationary,\nlargely relying on the Sobolev approximation. However, observations with the\nnewest instruments, together with progress in model calculations, ultimately\ndictate a cardinal change of this paradigm: stellar winds are highly\ninhomogeneous. Hence, we are now advancing to a new stage in our understanding\nof stellar winds. Using the foundations laid by V.V. Sobolev and his school, we\nnow update and further develop the stellar spectral analysis techniques. New\nsophisticated 3-D models of radiation transfer in inhomogeneous expanding media\nelucidate the physics of stellar winds and improve classical empiric mass-loss\nrate diagnostics. Applications of these new techniques to multiwavelength\nobservations of massive stars yield consistent and robust stellar wind\nparameters.\n", "  In-beam evaluation of a fully-equipped medium-size 30$\\times$30 cm$^2$\nResistive Plate WELL (RPWELL) detector is presented. It consists here of a\nsingle element gas-avalanche multiplier with Semitron ESD225 resistive plate, 1\ncm$^2$ readout pads and APV25/SRS electronics. Similarly to previous results\nwith small detector prototypes, stable operation at high detection efficiency\n(>98%) and low average pad multiplicity (~1.2) were recorded with 150 GeV muon\nand high-rate pion beams, in Ne/(5%CH$_4$), Ar/(5%CH$_4$) and Ar/(7%CO$_2$).\nThis is an important step towards the realization of robust detectors suitable\nfor applications requiring large-area coverage; among them Digital Hadron\nCalorimetry.\n", "  Based on the results in [Nucl. Phys. B 866 (2013) 212], we consider a way to\nconstruct a higher-derivative mechanical model which possesses the\n$l$-conformal Galilei symmetry. The dynamical system describes generalized\nPais-Uhlenbeck oscillator in the presence of an effective external field.\n", "  Binary mixtures of Bose-Einstein condensates trapped in deep optical lattices\nand subjected to equal contributions of Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit\ncoupling (SOC), are investigated in the presence of a periodic time modulation\nof the Zeeman field. SOC tunability is explicitly demonstrated by adopting a\nmean-field tight-binding model for the BEC mixture and by performing an\naveraging approach in the strong modulation limit. In this case, the system can\nbe reduced to an unmodulated vector discrete nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation\nwith a rescaled SOC tunning parameter $\\alpha$, which depends only on the ratio\nbetween amplitude and frequency of the applied Zeeman field. The dependence of\nthe spectrum of the linear system on $\\alpha$ has been analytically\ncharacterized. In particular, we show that extremal curves (ground and highest\nexcited states) of the linear spectrum are continuous piecewise functions\n(together with their derivatives) of $\\alpha$, which consist of a finite number\nof decreasing band lobes joined by constant lines. This structure also remains\nin presence of not too large nonlinearities. Most important, the interactions\nintroduce a number of localized states in the band-gaps that undergo change of\nproperties as they collide with band lobes. The stability of ground states in\nthe presence of the modulating field has been demonstrated by real time\nevolutions of the original (un-averaged) system. Localization properties of the\nground state induced by the SOC tuning, and a parameter design for possible\nexperimental observation have also been discussed.\n", "  In order to understand the possible $q\\bar{q}$ quark-model assignments of the\n$B_J(5840)$ and $B_J(5960)$ recently reported by the LHCb Collaboration, we\nevaluate mass spectra, strong decays, and radiative decays of bottom and\nbottom-strange mesons in a nonrelativistic quark model. Comparing these\npredictions with the relevant experimental results, we suggest that the\n$B_J(5840)$ and $B_J(5960)$ can be identified as the $B(2^1S_0)$ and\n$B(1^3D_3)$, respectively, and the $B(5970)$ reported by the CDF Collaboration\ncan be interpreted as the $B(2^3S_1)$ or $B(1^3D_3)$. Further precise\nmeasurements of the width, spin and decay modes of the $B(5970)$ are needed to\ndistinguish these two assignments. These predictions of bottom and\nbottom-strange mesons can provide useful information to further experimental\ninvestigations.\n", "  Within the framework of the full potential projector-augmented wave\nmethodology, we present a promising low-scaling $GW$ implementation. It allows\nfor quasiparticle calculations with a scaling that is cubic in the system size\nand linear in the number of $k$ points used to sample the Brillouin zone. This\nis achieved by calculating the polarizability and self-energy in the real space\nand imaginary time domain. The transformation from the imaginary time to the\nfrequency domain is done by an efficient discrete Fourier transformation with\nonly a few nonuniform grid points. Fast Fourier transformations are used to go\nfrom real space to reciprocal space and vice versa. The analytic continuation\nfrom the imaginary to the real frequency axis is performed by exploiting\nThiele's reciprocal difference approach. Finally, the method is applied\nsuccessfully to predict the quasiparticle energies and spectral functions of\ntypical semiconductors (Si, GaAs, SiC, and ZnO), insulators (C, BN, MgO, and\nLiF), and metals (Cu and SrVO$_3$). The results are compared with conventional\n$GW$ calculations. Good agreement is achieved, highlighting the strength of the\npresent method.\n", "  Many studies have investigated students' epistemological framing when solving\nphysics problems. Framing supports students' problem solving as they decide\nwhat knowledge to employ and the necessary steps to solve the problem. Students\nmay frame the same problem differently and take alternate paths to a correct\nsolution. When students work in group settings, they share and discuss their\nframing to decide how to proceed in problem solving as a whole group. In this\nstudy, we investigate how groups of students negotiate their framing and frame\nshifts in group problem solving.\n", "  We apply in a schematic model a theory beyond mean-field, namely Stochastic\nTime-Dependent Hartree-Fock (STDHF), which includes dynamical electron-electron\ncollisions on top of an incoherent ensemble of mean-field states by occasional\n2-particle-2-hole ($2p2h$) jumps. The model considered here is inspired by a\nLipkin-Meshkov-Glick model of $\\Omega$ particles distributed into two bands of\nenergy and coupled by a two-body interaction. Such a model can be exactly\nsolved (numerically though) for small $\\Omega$. It therefore allows a direct\ncomparison of STDHF and the exact propagation. The systematic impact of the\nmodel parameters as the density of states, the excitation energy and the\nbandwidth is presented and discussed. The time evolution of the STDHF compares\nfairly well with the exact entropy, as soon as the excitation energy is\nsufficiently large to allow $2p2h$ transitions. Limitations concerning low\nenergy excitations and memory effects are also discussed.\n", "  We present experimental demonstrations of two-photon interference involving\ntemporally separated photons within two types of interferometers: a\nMach-Zehnder interferometer and a polarization-based Michelson interferometer.\nThe two-photon states are probabilistically prepared in a symmetrically\nsuperposed state within the two interferometer arms by introducing a large time\ndelay between two input photons; this state is composed of two temporally\nseparated photons, which are in two different or the same spatial modes. We\nthen observe two-photon interference fringes involving both the Hong-Ou-Mandel\ninterference effect and the interference of path-entangled two-photon states\nsimultaneously in a single interferometric setup. The observed two-photon\ninterference fringes provide simultaneous observation of the interferometric\nproperties of the single-photon and two-photon wavepackets. The observations\ncan also facilitate a more comprehensive understanding of the origins of the\ninterference phenomena arising from spatially bunched/anti-bunched two-photon\nstates comprised of two temporally separated photons within the interferometer\narms.\n", "  The authors of Phys.Rev.Lett. \\textbf{111}, 240402 (2013) conclude that \"the\npast of the photons is not represented by continuous trajectories\". A simple\nanalysis by standard quantum mechanics shows that this claim is false.\n", "  The three gluon one particle irreducible function is investigated using\nlattice QCD simulations over a large region of momentum in the Landau gauge for\nfour dimensional pure Yang-Mills equations and the SU(3) gauge group. The\nresults favor a zero crossing of the gluon form factor for momenta in the range\n$220 - 260$ MeV. This zero crossing is required to happen in order to have a\nproperly defined set of Dyson-Schwinger equations. It is also shown that in the\nhigh momentum region the lattice results are compatible with the predictions of\nrenormalisation group improved perturbation theory.\n", "  We apply the operator product expansion (OPE) technique to the decay and\nannihilation of heavy particles in a thermal medium with temperature below the\nheavy particle mass, m_chi. This allows us to explain two interesting\nobservations made before: a) that the leading thermal correction to the decay\nwidth of a charged particle is the same multiplicative factor of the\nzero-temperature width for a two-body decay and muon decay, and b) that the\nleading thermal correction to fermionic dark matter annihilation arises only at\norder T^4/m_chi^4. The OPE further considerably simplifies the computation and\nfactorizes it into model-independent matrix elements in the thermal background,\nand short-distance coefficients to be computed in zero-temperature field\ntheory.\n", "  During its 5 year mission, the Kepler spacecraft has uncovered a diverse\npopulation of planetary systems with orbital configurations ranging from\nsingle-transiting planets to systems of multiple planets co-transiting the\nparent star. By comparing the relative occurrences of multiple to\nsingle-transiting systems, recent analyses have revealed a significant\nover-abundance of singles. Dubbed the \"Kepler Dichotomy,\" this feature has been\ninterpreted as evidence for two separate populations of planetary systems: one\nwhere all orbits are confined to a single plane, and a second where the\nconstituent planetary orbits possess significant mutual inclinations, allowing\nonly a single member to be observed in transit at a given epoch. In this work,\nwe demonstrate that stellar obliquity, excited within the disk-hosting stage,\ncan explain this dichotomy. Young stars rotate rapidly, generating a\nsignificant quadrupole moment which torques the planetary orbits, with inner\nplanets influenced more strongly. Given nominal parameters, this torque is\nsufficiently strong to excite significant mutual inclinations between planets,\nenhancing the number of single-transiting planets, sometimes through a\ndynamical instability. Furthermore, as hot stars appear to possess\nsystematically higher obliquities, we predict that single-transiting systems\nshould be relatively more prevalent around more massive stars. We analyze the\nKepler data and confirm this signal to be present.\n", "  We propose and study a novel extension of the Standard Model based on the B-L\ngauge symmetry that can account for dark matter and neutrino masses. In this\nmodel, right-handed neutrinos are absent and the gauge anomalies are canceled\ninstead by four chiral fermions with fractional B-L charges. After the breaking\nof $U(1)_{B-L}$, these fermions arrange themselves into two Dirac particles,\nthe lightest of which is automatically stable and plays the role of the dark\nmatter. We determine the regions of the parameter space consistent with the\nobserved dark matter density and show that they can be partially probed via\ndirect and indirect dark matter detection or collider searches at the LHC.\nNeutrino masses, on the other hand, can be explained by a variant of the\ntype-II seesaw mechanism involving one of the two scalar fields responsible for\nthe dark matter mass.\n", "  The so called one-parameter (often called $\\varkappa$) deformed $AdS$ string\nsigma models have attracted a lot of attention lately in the study of\nintegrability in string theory. We construct various circular string solutions\nin the $(AdS_3 \\times S^3)_{\\varkappa}$ background and describe the\ncharacteristics of such solutions qualitatively. We study the Bohr-Sommerfeld\nlike quantization for these string states to characterise the motion. Further\nwe find a `long' string limit of such circular strings in the\n$\\varkappa$-deformed $AdS_3$ and find a novel dependence of the oscillation\nnumber on the energy in the next to leading order expansion.\n", "  Using the worldline formalism of the Dirac field with a non-Abelian gauge\nsymmetry we show how to describe the matter field transforming in an arbitrary\nrepresentation of the gauge group. Colour degrees of freedom are carried on the\nworldline by auxiliary fields, responsible for providing path ordering and the\nWilson-loop coupling. The Hilbert space of these fields is reducible but we\nmake use of recent work in order to project onto a single, arbitrary,\nirreducible representation. By functionally quantising the resulting theory we\nshow that this procedure correctly generates the Wilson-loop interaction\nbetween the gauge field and the matter field taken to transform in a chosen\nrepresentation. This work has direct application to physical observables such\nas scattering amplitudes in the presence of such a matter multiplet and lifts\nthe restriction on the type of matter that has previously featured in worldline\ncalculations.\n", "  A new method to calculate spectroscopic properties of deformed nuclei is\nproposed: configuration interaction on top of projected density functional\ntheory (CI-PDFT). The general concept of this approach is discussed in the\nframework of covariant density functional theory and its validity is\nillustrated in an application to the yrast band of the nucleus Cr-54. It is\nfound that the experimentally observed excitation energies for the yrast band\nin Cr-54 can be well reproduced. In contrast to conventional shell-model\ncalculations, there is no core and only a relatively small number of\nconfigurations is sufficient for a satisfying description. No new parameters\nare necessary, because the effective interaction is derived from an universal\ndensity functional given in the literature.\n", "  We study possibility of obtaining velocity spectra by studying turbulence in\nan optically thick medium using velocity centroids (VCs).We find that the\nregime of universal, i.e. independent of underlying turbulence statistics,\nfluctuations discovered originally within the velocity channel analysis (VCA)\ncarries over to the statistics of VCs. In other words, for large absorptions\nthe VC lose their ability to reflect the spectra of turbulence. Combining our\npresent study with the earlier studies of centroids in Esquivel & Lazarian, we\nconclude that centroids are applicable for studies subsonic/transsonic\nturbulence for the range of scales that is limited by the absorption effects.\nWe also consider VCs based on absorption lines and define the range of their\napplicability. We address the problem of analytical description of spectra and\nanisotropies of fluctuations that are available through studies using VC. We\nobtain spectra and anisotropy of VC fluctuations arising from Alfv\\'en, slow\nand fast modes that constitute the compressible MHD cascade to address the\nissue of anisotropy of VC statistics, and show how the VC anisotropy can be\nused to find the media magnetization as well as to identify and separate\ncontributions from Alfv\\'en, slow and fast modes. Our study demonstrates that\nVCs are complementary to the tools provided by the VCA. In order to study\nturbulent volume for which the resolution of single dish telescopes is\ninsufficient, we demonstrate how the studies of anisotropy can be performed\nusing interferometers.\n", "  We present a microelectromechanical system, in which a silicon beam is\nattached to a comb-drive actuator, that is used to tune the tension in the\nsilicon beam, and thus its resonance frequency. By measuring the resonance\nfrequencies of the system, we show that the comb-drive actuator and the silicon\nbeam behave as two strongly coupled resonators. Interestingly, the effective\ncoupling rate (~ 1.5 MHz) is tunable with the comb-drive actuator (+10%) as\nwell as with a side-gate (-10%) placed close to the silicon beam. In contrast,\nthe effective spring constant of the system is insensitive to either of them\nand changes only by $\\pm$ 0.5%. Finally, we show that the comb-drive actuator\ncan be used to switch between different coupling rates with a frequency of at\nleast 10 kHz.\n", "  Scattering of protons with transversal polarization $p_y^p$ on deuterons with\ntensor polarization $P_{xz}$ provides a null-test signal for time-reversal (T)\ninvariance violating but parity (P) conserving effects. We calculate the\ncorresponding null-test observable at beam energies 100-1000 MeV within the\nspin-dependent Glauber theory considering T-violating P-conserving\nnucleon-nucleon interactions. The S-wave component of the deuteron wave\nfunction as well as the D-wave are taken into account and the latter is found\nto play an important role for the magnitude and the energy dependence of the\nobservable in question. Specifically, with inclusion of the D wave the maximum\nof the obtained signal is shifted to higher beam energies, i.e. to 700-800 MeV.\n", "  We study the scalar leptoquark effects on the rare semileptonic decays of\n$\\Lambda_b$ baryon, governed by the quark level transition $b \\to s l^+ l^-$.\nWe estimate the branching ratios, forward-backward asymmetries, lepton\npolarization parameters and the lepton flavour non-universality effects in\nthese decay channels. We find significant deviations from the corresponding\nstandard model predictions in some of the observables due to leptoquark\neffects. We also investigate the lepton flavour violating decays $\\Lambda_b \\to\n\\Lambda l_i^- l_j^+$, the branching ratios of which are found to be ${\\cal\nO}(10^{-10} - 10^{-9})$.\n", "  It is well known that Akhmediev breathers of the nonlinear cubic Schrodinger\nequation can be superposed nonlinearly via the Darboux transformation to yield\nbreathers of higher order. Surprisingly, we find that the peak height of each\nAkhmediev breather only adds {\\it linearly} to form the peak height of the\nfinal breather. Using this new peak-height formula, we show that at any given\nperiodicity, there exist a unique high-order breather of maximal intensity.\nMoreover, these high-order breathers form a continuous hierarchy, growing in\nintensity with increasing periodicity. For any such higher-order breather, a\nsimple initial wave function can be extracted from the Darboux transformation\nto dynamically generate that breather from the nonlinear Schrodinger equation.\n", "  This paper presents an innovative nano strain-amplifier employed to\nsignificantly enhance the sensitivity of piezoresistive strain sensors.\nInspired from the dogbone structure, the nano strain-amplifier consists of a\nnano thin frame released from the substrate, where nanowires were formed at the\ncentre of the frame. Analytical and numerical results indicated that a nano\nstrain-amplifier significantly increases the strain induced into a free\nstanding nanowire, resulting in a large change in their electrical conductance.\nThe proposed structure was demonstrated in p-type cubic silicon carbide\nnanowires fabricated using a top down process. The experimental data showed\nthat the nano strain-amplifier can enhance the sensitivity of SiC strain\nsensors at least 5.4 times larger than that of the conventional structures.\nThis result indicates the potential of the proposed strain-amplifier for\nultra-sensitive mechanical sensing applications.\n", "  We consider the influence of photon-initiated processes on high-mass particle\nproduction. We discuss in detail the photon PDF at relatively high parton $x$,\nrelevant to such processes, and evaluate its uncertainties. In particular we\nshow that, as the dominant contribution to the input photon distribution is due\nto coherent photon emission, at phenomenologically relevant scales the photon\nPDF is already well determined in this region, with the corresponding\nuncertainties under good control. We then demonstrate the implications of this\nresult for the example processes of high-mass lepton and $W$ boson pair\nproduction at the LHC and FCC. While for the former process the\nphoton-initiated contribution is expected to be small, in the latter case we\nfind that it is potentially significant, in particular at larger masses.\n", "  In this work, we analyze Jovian Trojans in the space of suitable resonant\nelements and we identify clusters of possible collisional origin by two\nindependent methods: the hierarchical clustering and a so-called \"randombox\".\nCompared to our previous work (Bro\\v{z} and Rozehnal 2011), we study a twice\nlarger sample. Apart from Eurybates, Ennomos and $1996\\,\\rm RJ$ families, we\nhave found three more clusters --- namely families around asteroids\n(20961)~Arkesilaos, (624)~Hektor in the $L_4$ libration zone and\n(247341)~$2001\\,\\rm UV_{209}$ in $L_5$. The families fulfill our stringent\ncriteria, i.e. a high statistical significance, an albedo homogeneity and a\nsteeper size-frequency distribution than that of background. In order to\nunderstand their nature, we simulate their long term collisional evolution with\nthe Boulder code (Morbidelli et al. 2009) and dynamical evolution using a\nmodified SWIFT integrator (Levison and Duncan, 1994). Within the framework of\nour evolutionary model, we were able to constrain the the age of the Hektor\nfamily to be either 1 to 4 Gyr or, less likely, 0.1 to 2.5 Gyr, depending on\ninitial impact geometry. Since (624) Hektor itself seems to be a bilobed--shape\nbody with a satellite (Marchis et al. 2014), i.e. an exceptional object, we\naddress its association with the D--type family and we demonstrate that the\nmoon and family could be created during a single impact event. We simulated the\ncratering event using a Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH, Benz and Asphaug,\n1994). This is also the first case of a family associated with a D--type parent\nbody.\n", "  Bukhvostov and Lipatov have shown that weakly interacting instantons and\nanti-instantons in the $O(3)$ non-linear sigma model in two dimensions are\ndescribed by an exactly soluble model containing two coupled Dirac fermions. We\npropose an exact formula for the vacuum energy of the model for twisted\nboundary conditions, expressing it through a special solution of the classical\nsinh-Gordon equation. The formula perfectly matches predictions of the standard\nrenormalized perturbation theory at weak couplings as well as the conformal\nperturbation theory at short distances. Our results also agree with the Bethe\nansatz solution of the model. A complete proof the proposed expression for the\nvacuum energy based on a combination of the Bethe ansatz techniques and the\nclassical inverse scattering transform method is presented in the second part\nof this work [40].\n", "  We examine a mechanism by which excitons are generated via the LO\n(longitudinal optical) phonon-assisted scattering process after optical\nexcitation of monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides. The exciton formation\ntime is computed as a function of the exciton center-of-mass wavevector,\nelectron and hole temperatures, and carrier densities for known values of the\nFr\\\"ohlich coupling constant, LO phonon energy, lattice temperature, and the\nexciton binding energy in layered structures. For the monolayer MoS$_2$, we\nobtain ultrafast exciton formation times on the sub-picosecond time scale at\ncharge densities of 5 $\\times$ 10$^{11}$ cm$^{-2}$ and carrier temperatures\nless than 300 K, in good agreement with recent experimental findings ($\\approx$\n0.3 ps). While excitons are dominantly created at zero center-of-mass\nwavevectors at low charge carrier temperatures ($\\approx$ 30 K), the exciton\nformation time is most rapid at non-zero wavevectors at higher temperatures\n($\\ge $ 120 K) of charge carriers. The results show the inverse square-law\ndependence of the exciton formation times on the carrier density, consistent\nwith a square-law dependence of photoluminescence on the excitation density.\nOur results show that excitons are formed more rapidly in exemplary monolayer\nselenide-based dichalcogenides (MoSe$_2$ and WSe$_2$) than sulphide-based\ndichalcogenides (MoS$_2$ and WS$_2$).\n", "  It is argued that the charged $Z^+_c(3885)$ resonance, treated as a\n`molecular' state of charmed $D$ and $D^*$ mesons, is likely to consist of two\npeaks unequally coupled to the $D^{*+} \\bar D^0$ and $D^+ \\bar D^{*0}$\nchannels. The peaks should be split in mass by at least approximately 1.5 MeV.\nThis behavior arises from an enhancement of the effect of isospin violation in\nthe masses of the $D$ and $D^*$ mesons due to apparent suppression of forces\nbetween the mesons depending on the spins of the heavy as well as of the light\nquarks. The suggested double-peak structure can be studied either by direct\nshape measurement in the channels with heavy mesons, or by isospin-violating\ntransitions from $Z_c^\\pm(3885)$ to the states of charmonium plus a light\nmeson.\n", "  Extreme ultraviolet (EUV) coronal dimmings are often observed in response to\nsolar eruptive events. These phenomena can be generated via several different\nphysical processes. For space weather, the most important of these is the\ntemporary void left behind by a coronal mass ejection (CME). Massive, fast CMEs\ntend to leave behind a darker void that also usually corresponds to minimum\nirradiance for the cooler coronal emissions. If the dimming is associated with\na solar flare, as is often the case, the flare component of the irradiance\nlight curve in the cooler coronal emission can be isolated and removed using\nsimultaneous measurements of warmer coronal lines. We apply this technique to\n37 dimming events identified during two separate two-week periods in 2011, plus\nan event on 2010 August 7 analyzed in a previous paper, to parameterize dimming\nin terms of depth and slope. We provide statistics on which combination of\nwavelengths worked best for the flare-removal method, describe the fitting\nmethods applied to the dimming light curves, and compare the dimming parameters\nwith corresponding CME parameters of mass and speed. The best linear\nrelationships found are\n  $$ \\begin{align} v_{CME} \\Big[\\frac{km}{s} \\Big] & \\approx 2.36 \\times 10^6\n\\Big[\\frac{km}{\\%} \\Big] \\times s_{dim} \\Big[\\frac{\\%}{s} \\Big] \\\\ m_{CME} [g]\n& \\approx 2.59 \\times 10^{15} \\Big[\\frac{g}{\\%} \\Big] \\times \\sqrt{d_{dim}}\n[\\%]. \\end{align} $$\n  These relationships could be used for space weather operations of estimating\nCME mass and speed using near-realtime irradiance dimming measurements.\n", "  We consider soft gluon emission corrections to the production of a\ntop-antitop pair in association with a W boson at the Large Hadron Collider. We\nobtain a soft-gluon resummation formula for this production process which is\nvalid up to next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy. We evaluate the soft\ngluon resummation formula in Mellin space by means of an in-house parton level\nMonte Carlo code which allows us to obtain predictions for the total cross\nsection as well as for several differential distributions. We study the impact\nof the soft-gluon resummation corrections in comparison to fixed order\ncalculations.\n", "  In an X-ray reflection spectrum, a tail-like spectral feature generated via\nCompton down-scattering, known as a Compton shoulder (CS), appears at the\nlow-energy side of the iron K$\\alpha$ line. Despite its great diagnostic\npotential, its use as a spectral probe of the reflector has been seriously\nlimited due to observational difficulties and modelling complexities. We\nrevisit the basic nature of the CS by systematic investigation into its\ndependence on spatial and temporal parameters. The calculations are performed\nby Monte-Carlo simulations for sphere and slab geometries. The dependence is\nobtained in a two-dimensional space of column density and metal abundance,\ndemonstrating that the CS solves parameter degeneration between them which was\nseen in conventional spectral analysis using photoelectric absorption and\nfluorescence lines. Unlike the iron line, the CS does not suffer from any\nobservational dependence on the spectral hardness. The CS profile is highly\ndependent on the inclination angle of the slab geometry unless the slab is\nCompton-thick, and the time evolution of the CS is shown to be useful to\nconstrain temporal information on the source if the intrinsic radiation is\nvariable. We also discuss how atomic binding of the scattering electrons in\ncold matter blurs the CS profile, finding that the effect is practically\nsimilar to thermal broadening in a plasma with a moderate temperature of\n$\\sim$5 eV. Spectral diagnostics using the CS is demonstrated with grating data\nof X-ray binary GX 301$-$2, and will be available in future with\nhigh-resolution spectra of active galactic nuclei obtained by\nmicrocalorimeters.\n", "  We perform MHD modeling of a single bright coronal loop to include the\ninteraction with a non-uniform magnetic field. The field is stressed by random\nfootpoint rotation in the central region and its energy is dissipated into\nheating by growing currents through anomalous magnetic diffusivity that\nswitches on in the corona above a current density threshold. We model an entire\nsingle magnetic flux tube, in the solar atmosphere extending from the high-beta\nchromosphere to the low-beta corona through the steep transition region. The\nmagnetic field expands from the chromosphere to the corona. The maximum\nresolution is ~30 km. We obtain an overall evolution typical of loop models and\nrealistic loop emission in the EUV and X-ray bands. The plasma confined in the\nflux tube is heated to active region temperatures (~3 MK) after ~2/3 hr.\nUpflows from the chromosphere up to ~100 km/s fill the core of the flux tube to\ndensities above 10^9 cm^-3. More heating is released in the low corona than the\nhigh corona and is finely structured both in space and time.\n", "  We investigate the masses of $cs \\bar c \\bar s$ tetraquark states in a\ndiquark-antidiquark picture employing the relativized quark model proposed by\nGodfrey and Isgur. Only the antitriplet diquark states in color space are\ncalculated. The diquark masses are obtained with the relativized potential\nfirstly, and then the diquark and antidiquark are treated as the usual\nantiquark and quark, respectively, and the masses of the tetraquark states are\nobtained by solving the Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation with the relativized potential\nbetween the diquark and antidiquark. The theoretical uncertainties induced by\nscreening effects are also taken into account. It is found that the resonance\nof $X(4140)$ can be regarded as the $cs \\bar c \\bar s$ tetraquark ground\nstates, and the $X(4700)$ can be assigned as the $2S$ excited tetraquark state.\nWhen the internal excited diquarks are taken into account, the resonance of\n$X(4500)$ can be explained as the tetraquark composed of one $2S$ scalar\ndiquark and one scalar antidiquark. In our approach, the $X(4274)$ cannot be\nexplained as a tetraquark state, however, it can be a good candidate of the\nconventional $\\chi_{c1}(3^3P_1)$ state. In addition, other charmonium-like\nstates $\\chi_{c0}(3915)$, $X(4350)$, $X(4630)$ and $X(4660)$, as the $cs \\bar c\n\\bar s$ tetraquark states, are also discussed.\n", "  We studied the atomic momentum distribution for a superposition of Bloch\nstates spreading in the lowest band of an optical lattice after the action of\nthe standing wave pulse. By designing the imposing pulse on this superposed\nstate, an atomic momentum pattern appears with narrower interval between the\nadjacent peaks that can be far less than the double recoil momentum. The\npatterns with narrower interval come from the superposition of the action of\nthe designed pulse on many Bloch states with quasi-momenta over the first\nBrillouin zone, where for each quasi-momentum there is an interference among\nseveral lowest bands. Our experimental result of narrow interval peaks is\nconsistent with the theoretical simulation. The patterns of multi modes with\ndifferent quasi-momenta are helpful for precise measurement and atomic\nmanipulation.\n", "  We present new, more precise measurements of the mass and distance of our\nGalaxy's central supermassive black hole, Sgr A*. These results stem from a new\nanalysis that more than doubles the time baseline for astrometry of faint stars\norbiting Sgr A*, combining two decades of speckle imaging and adaptive optics\ndata. Specifically, we improve our analysis of the speckle images by using\ninformation about a star's orbit from the deep adaptive optics data (2005 -\n2013) to inform the search for the star in the speckle years (1995 - 2005).\nWhen this new analysis technique is combined with the first complete\nre-reduction of Keck Galactic Center speckle images using speckle holography,\nwe are able to track the short-period star S0-38 (K-band magnitude = 17,\norbital period = 19 years) through the speckle years. We use the kinematic\nmeasurements from speckle holography and adaptive optics to estimate the orbits\nof S0-38 and S0-2 and thereby improve our constraints of the mass ($M_{bh}$)\nand distance ($R_o$) of Sgr A*: $M_{bh} =\n4.02\\pm0.16\\pm0.04\\times10^6~M_{\\odot}$ and $7.86\\pm0.14\\pm0.04$ kpc. The\nuncertainties in $M_{bh}$ and $R_o$ as determined by the combined orbital fit\nof S0-2 and S0-38 are improved by a factor of 2 and 2.5, respectively, compared\nto an orbital fit of S0-2 alone and a factor of $\\sim$2.5 compared to previous\nresults from stellar orbits. This analysis also limits the extended dark mass\nwithin 0.01 pc to less than $0.13\\times10^{6}~M_{\\odot}$ at 99.7% confidence, a\nfactor of 3 lower compared to prior work.\n", "  Delensing is an increasingly important technique to reverse the gravitational\nlensing of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and thus reveal primordial\nsignals the lensing may obscure. We present a first demonstration of delensing\non Planck temperature maps using the cosmic infrared background (CIB).\nReversing the lensing deflections in Planck CMB temperature maps using a linear\ncombination of the 545 and 857GHz maps as a lensing tracer, we find that the\nlensing effects in the temperature power spectrum are reduced in a manner\nconsistent with theoretical expectations. In particular, the characteristic\nsharpening of the acoustic peaks of the temperature power spectrum resulting\nfrom successful delensing is detected at a significance of 16$\\rm{\\sigma}$,\nwith an amplitude of $A_{\\rm{delens}} = 1.12 \\pm 0.07$ relative to the expected\nvalue of unity. This first demonstration on data of CIB delensing, and of\ndelensing techniques in general, is significant because lensing removal will\nsoon be essential for achieving high-precision constraints on inflationary\nB-mode polarization.\n", "  We study instanton corrections to the vacuum expectation value (VEV) of 1/6\nBPS Wilson loops in ABJM theory from the Fermi gas approach. We mainly consider\nWilson loops in the fundamental representation and winding Wilson loops, but we\nalso initiate the study of Wilson loops with two boundaries. We find that the\nmembrane instanton corrections to the Wilson loop VEV are determined by the\nrefined topological string in the Nekrasov-Shatashvili limit, and the pole\ncancellation mechanism between membrane instantons and worldsheet instantons\nworks also in the Wilson loop VEVs as in the case of the partition functions.\n", "  Relative biological effectiveness (RBE) plays an important role in designing\na uniform dose response for ion beam therapy. In this study the biological\neffectiveness of a carbon ion beam delivery system was investigated using Monte\nCarlo simulation. A carbon ion beam delivery line was designed for the Korea\nHeavy Ion Medical Accelerator (KHIMA) project. The GEANT4 simulation tool kit\nwas used to simulate carbon beam transporting into media. An incident energy\ncarbon ion beam in the range between 220 MeV/u and 290 MeV/u was chosen to\ngenerate secondary particles. The microdosimetric-kinetic (MK) model is applied\nto describe the RBE of 10% survival in human salivary gland (HSG) cells. The\nRBE weighted dose was estimated as a function of the penetrating depth of the\nwater phantom along the incident beam direction. A biologically\nphoton-equivalent Spread Out Bragg Peak (SOBP) was designed using the RBE\nweighted absorbed dose. Finally, the RBE of mixed beams was predicted as a\nfunction of the water phantom depth.\n", "  We consider the conformal higher spin (CHS) theory in d=4 that contains the\ns=1 Maxwell vector, s=2 Weyl graviton and their higher spin s=3,4,...\ncounterparts with higher-derivative \\box^s kinetic terms. The interacting\naction for such theory can be found as the coefficient of the logarithmically\ndivergent part in the induced action for sources coupled to higher spin\ncurrents in a free complex scalar field model. We explicitly determine some\ncubic and quartic interaction vertices in the CHS action from scalar loop\nintegrals. We then compute the simplest tree-level 4-particle scattering\namplitudes 11 -> 11, 22 -> 22 and 11 -> 22 and find that after summing up all\nthe intermediate CHS exchanges they vanish. This generalises the vanishing of\nthe scattering amplitude for external conformal scalars interacting via the\nexchange of all CHS fields found earlier in arXiv:1512.08896. This vanishing\nshould generalise to all scattering amplitudes in the CHS theory and as in the\nconformal scalar scattering case should be a consequence of the underlying\ninfinite dimensional higher spin symmetry that extends the standard conformal\nsymmetry.\n", "  Measurement of the brightness temperature of extended radio emission demands\nknowledge of the gain (or aperture efficiency) of the telescope and measurement\nof the polarized component of the emission requires correction for the\nconversion of unpolarized emission from sky and ground to apparently polarized\nsignal. Radiation properties of the John A. Galt Telescope at the Dominion\nRadio Astrophysical Observatory were studied through analysis and measurement\nin order to provide absolute calibration of a survey of polarized emission from\nthe entire northern sky from 1280 to 1750 MHz, and to understand the\npolarization performance of the telescope. Electromagnetic simulators CST and\nGRASP-10 were used to compute radiation patterns of the telescope in all Stokes\nparameters, and aperture efficiency. Aperture efficiency was also evaluated\nusing geometrical optics and was measured using Cyg A. Measured aperture\nefficiency varied smoothly with frequency between values of 0.49 and 0.54;\nGRASP-10 yielded values 6.5% higher but with closely similar variation with\nfrequency. Overall error across the frequency band is 3%, but values at any two\nfrequencies are relatively correct to ~1%. Dominant influences on aperture\nefficiency are illumination taper of the feed radiation pattern and shadowing\nby the feed-support struts. A model of ground emission was developed based on\nmeasurements and on empirical data from remote sensing of the Earth from\nsatellite-borne telescopes. This model was convolved with the computed antenna\nresponse to estimate conversion of ground emission into spurious polarized\nsignal. The computed spurious signal is comparable to measured values, but is\nnot accurate enough to be used to correct observations. A simpler model, in\nwhich the ground is considered as an unpolarized emitter with a brightness\ntemperature of ~240 K, is shown to have useful accuracy when compared to\nmeasurements.\n", "  The formation of nonlinear Bloch states in open driven-dissipative system of\nexciton-polaritons loaded into a weak-contrast 1D periodic lattice is studied\nnumerically and analytically. The condensate is described within the framework\nof mean-field theory by the coupled equations for the order parameter and for\nthe density of incoherent excitons. The stationary nonlinear solutions having\nthe structure of Bloch waves are studied in detail. It is shown that there is a\nbifurcation leading to the appearance of a family of essentially nonlinear\nstates. The special feature of these solutions is that its current does not\nvanish when the quasi-momentum of the state approaches the values equal to the\nhalf of the lattice constant. To explain the bifurcations found in numerical\nsimulations a simple perturbative approach is developed. The stability of the\nnonlinear states is examined by linear spectral analysis and by direct\nnumerical simulations. An experimental scheme allowing the observation of the\ndiscussed nonlinear current states is suggested and studied by numerical\nsimulations.\n", "  We review the occurrence of negative energies in Pais-Uhlenbeck oscillator.\nWe point out that in the absence of interactions negative energies are not\nproblematic, neither in the classical nor in the quantized theory. However, in\nthe presence of interactions that couple positive and negative energy degrees\nof freedom the system is unstable, unless the potential is bounded from bellow\nand above. We review some approaches in the literature that attempt to avoid\nthe problem of negative energies in the Pais-Uhlenbeck oscillator.\n", "  FLARE (First Light And Reionization Explorer) is a space mission that will be\nsubmitted to ESA (M5 call). Its primary goal (about 80% of lifetime) is to\nidentify and study galaxies that dwell in the universe before the end of the\nreionization up to about z = 15, a redshift that might not be statistically\nreachable for JWST, Euclid and WFIRST. A secondary objective (about 20% of\nlifetime) is to survey star formation in the Milky Way.\n  The strategy selected for FLARE optimizes the science return: imaging and\nspectroscopic integral-field observations will be carried out simultaneously on\ntwo parallel focal planes and over very wide instantaneous fields of view.\nFLARE will feature an instantaneous field of view of about 0.2 deg$^2$ with\n0.2-arcsec pixels and an instantaneous integral-field spectroscopic field of\nview of about 1 arcmin$^2$ with R = 500 - 1000 and an angular resolution of\nabout 0.4 arcsec. To detect first-light galaxies, the imaging and spectroscopic\nsurvey (parallel observations over about 6 years) will reach m$_{AB}$ = 28 and\nf$_{\\lambda}$ = 10$^{-18}$ erg/cm$^2$/S.\n  FLARE will help addressing two of ESA's Cosmic Vision themes: a) \"How did the\nuniverse originate and what is it made of?\" and b) \"What are the conditions for\nplanet formation and the emergence of life?\" and more specifically, \"From gas\nand dust to stars and planets\".\n  FLARE will provide to the ESA community a leading position to statistically\nstudy the early universe after JWST's deep but pin-hole surveys. Moreover, the\ninstrumental development of wide-field imaging and wide-field integral-field\nspectroscopy in space will be a major breakthrough after making them available\non ground-based telescopes.\n", "  It is well known that the mean field theory of directed polymers in a random\nmedium exhibits replica symmetry breaking with a distribution of overlaps which\nconsists of two delta functions. Here we show that the leading finite size\ncorrection to this distribution of overlaps has a universal character which can\nbe computed explicitly. Our results can also be interpreted as genealogical\nproperties of branching Brownian motion or of branching random walks.\n", "  We analyse 38-month of contiguous short-cadence data, concentrating on mode\nmultiplets induced by the star rotation and on frequencies forming linear\ncombinations that show intriguing behaviors during the course of the\nobservations. We find clear signatures that point toward nonlinear effects\npredicted by resonant mode coupling mechanisms. These couplings can induce\nvarious mode behaviors for the components of multiplets and for frequencies\nrelated by linear relationships. We find that a triplet at 5760\\,$\\mu$Hz, a\nquintuplet at 5287\\,$\\mu$Hz and a ($\\ell>2$) multiplet at 5412\\,$\\mu$Hz, all\ninduced by rotation, show clear frequency and amplitude modulations which are\ntypical of the so-called intermediate regime of a resonance between the\ncomponents. One triplet at 316\\,$\\mu$Hz and a doublet at 394\\,$\\mu$Hz show\nmodulated amplitude and constant frequency which can be associated with a\nnarrow transitory regime of the resonance. Another triplet at 519\\,$\\mu$Hz\nappears to be in a frequency lock regime where both frequency and amplitude are\nconstant. Additionally, three linear combination of frequencies near\n6076\\,$\\mu$Hz also show amplitude and frequency modulations, which are likely\nrelated to a three-mode direct resonance. The identified frequency and\namplitude modulations are the first clear-cut signatures of nonlinear resonant\ncouplings occurring in pulsating hot B subdwarf stars. However, the observed\nbehaviors suggest that the resonances occurring in these stars usually follow\nmore complicated patterns than the simple predictions from current nonlinear\ntheoretical frameworks. These results should therefore motivate further work to\ndevelop the theory of nonlinear stellar pulsations, considering that stars like\nKIC~10139564 now offer remarkable testbeds to do so.\n", "  This work analyzes the X-ray, EUV and UV emission apparently coming from the\nEarth-facing (dark) side of Venus as observed with Hinode/XRT and SDO/AIA\nduring a transit across the solar disk occurred in 2012. We have measured\nsignificant X-Ray, EUV and UV flux from Venus dark side. As a check we have\nalso analyzed a Mercury transit across the solar disk, observed with Hinode/XRT\nin 2006. We have used the latest version of the Hinode/XRT Point Spread\nFunction (PSF) to deconvolve Venus and Mercury X-ray images, in order to remove\npossible instrumental scattering. Even after deconvolution, the flux from Venus\nshadow remains significant while in the case of Mercury it becomes negligible.\nSince stray-light contamination affects the XRT Ti-poly filter data from the\nVenus transit in 2012, we performed the same analysis with XRT Al-mesh filter\ndata, which is not affected by the light leak. Even the Al-mesh filter data\nshow residual flux. We have also found significant EUV (304 A, 193 A, 335 A)\nand UV (1700 A) flux in Venus shadow, as measured with SDO/AIA. The EUV\nemission from Venus dark side is reduced when appropriate deconvolution methods\nare applied; the emission remains significant, however. The light curves of the\naverage flux of the shadow in the X-ray, EUV, and UV bands appear different as\nVenus crosses the solar disk, but in any of them the flux is, at any time,\napproximately proportional to the average flux in a ring surrounding Venus, and\ntherefore proportional to the average flux of the solar regions around Venus\nobscuring disk line of sight. The proportionality factor depends on the band.\nThis phenomenon has no clear origin; we suggest it may be due to scatter\noccurring in the very long magnetotail of Venus.\n", "  We present Karl G Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) observations of CO(2-1) line\nemission and rest-frame 250GHz continuum emission of the Hyper-Luminous IR\nGalaxies (HyLIRGs) BRI1202-0725 (z=4.69) and BRI1335-0417 (z=4.41), with an\nangular resolution as high as 0.15\". Our low order CO observations delineate\nthe cool molecular gas, the fuel for star formation in the systems, in\nunprecedented detail. For BRI1202-0725, line emission is seen from both extreme\nstarburst galaxies: the quasar host and the optically obscured submm galaxy\n(SMG), in addition to one of the Lyman-alpha emitting galaxies in the group.\nLine emission from the SMG shows an east-west extension of about 0.6\". For\nLyalpha-2, the CO emission is detected at the same velocity as [CII] and [NII],\nindicating a total gas mass ~4.0*10^10 solar masses. The CO emission from\nBRI1335-0417 peaks at the nominal quasar position, with a prominent northern\nextension (~1\", a possible tidal feature). The gas depletion timescales are\n~10^7 years for the three HyLIRGs, consistent with extreme starbursts, while\nthat of Lyalpha-2 may be consistent with main sequence galaxies. We interpret\nthese sources as major star formation episodes in the formation of massive\ngalaxies and supermassive black holes (SMBHs) via gas rich mergers in the early\nUniverse.\n", "  We consider the coupling of the magnons in both quantum ferromagnets and\nantiferromagnets to the longitudinal order-parameter fluctuations, and the\nresulting nonanalytic behavior of the longitudinal susceptibility. In classical\nmagnets it is well known that long-range correlations induced by the magnons\nlead to a singular wave-number dependence of the form $1/k^{4-d}$ in all\ndimensions 2<d<4, for both ferromagnets and antiferromagnets. At zero\ntemperature we find a profound difference between the two cases. Consistent\nwith naive power counting, the longitudinal susceptibility in a quantum\nantiferromagnet scales as $k^{d-3}$ for 1<d<3, whereas in a quantum ferromagnet\nthe analogous result, $k^{d-2}$, is absent due to a zero scaling function. This\nabsence of a nonanalyticity in the longitudinal susceptibility is due to the\nlack of magnon number fluctuations in the ground state of a quantum\nferromagnet; correlation functions that are sensitive to other fluctuations do\nexhibit the behavior predicted by simple power counting. Also of interest is\nthe dynamical behavior as expressed in the longitudinal part of the dynamical\nstructure factor, which is directly measurable via neutron scattering. For both\nferromagnets and antiferromagnets there is a logarithmic singularity at the\nmagnon frequency with a prefactor that vanishes as $T\\to 0$. In the\nantiferromagnetic case there also is a nonzero contribution at T=0 that is\nmissing for ferromagnets. Magnon damping due to quenched disorder restores the\nexpected scaling behavior of the longitudinal susceptibility in the\nferromagnetic case; it scales as $k^{d-2}$ if the order parameter is not\nconserved, or as $k^d$ if it is. Detailed predictions are made for both two-\nand three-dimensional systems at both T=0 and in the limit of low temperatures,\nand the physics behind the various nonanalytic behaviors is discussed.\n", "  Melnikov's method is an analytical way to show the existence of classical\nchaos generated by a Smale horseshoe. It is a powerful technique, though its\napplicability is somewhat limited. In this paper, we present a solution of type\nIIB supergravity to which Melnikov's method is applicable. This is a brane-wave\ntype deformation of the AdS$_5\\times$S$^5$ background. By employing two\nreduction ans\\\"atze, we study two types of coupled pendulum-oscillator systems.\nThen the Melnikov function is computed for each of the systems by following the\nstandard way of Holmes and Marsden and the existence of chaos is shown\nanalytically.\n", "  We discuss in detail level/rank duality in three-dimensional Chern-Simons\ntheories and various related dualities in three-dimensional Chern-Simons-matter\ntheories. We couple the dual Lagrangians to appropriate background fields\n(including gauge fields, spin$_c$ connections and the metric). The non-trivial\nmaps between the currents and the line operators in the dual theories is\naccounted for by mixing of these fields. In order for the duality to be valid\nwe must add finite counterterms depending on these background fields. This\nanalysis allows us to resolve a number of puzzles with these dualities, to\nprovide derivations of some of them, and to find new consistency conditions and\nrelations between them. In addition, we find new level/rank dualities of\ntopological Chern-Simons theories and new dualities of Chern-Simons-matter\ntheories, including new boson/boson and fermion/fermion dualities.\n", "  In this paper we study the Nielsen identity for the supersymmetric\nChern-Simons-matter model in the superfield formalism, in three spacetime\ndimensions. The Nielsen identity is essential to understand the gauge\ninvariance of the symmetry breaking mechanism, and it is calculated by using\nthe BRST invariance of the model. We discuss the technical difficulties in\napplying this identity to the complete effective superpotential, but we show\nhow we can study in detail the gauge independence of one part of the effective\nsuperpotential, $K_{eff}$. We calculate the renormalization group functions of\nthe model for arbitrary gauge-fixing parameter, finding them to be independent\nof the gauge choice. This result can be used to argue that $K_{eff}$ also does\nnot depend on the gauge parameter. We discuss the possibility of the extension\nof these results to the complete effective superpotential.\n", "  According to the famous Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM), the universality of\nspontaneous defect generation in continuous phase transitions (CPTs) can be\nunderstood by the critical slowing down. In most CPTs of atomic Bose-Einstein\ncondensates (BECs), the universality of spontaneous defect generations has been\nexplained by the divergent relaxation time associated with the nontrivial\ngapless Bogoliubov excitations. However, for atomic BECs in synthetic gauge\nfields, their spontaneous superfluidity breakdown is resulted from the\ndivergent correlation length associated with the zero Landau critical velocity.\nHere, by considering an atomic BEC ladder subjected to a synthetic magnetic\nfield, we reveal that the spontaneous superfluidity breakdown obeys the KZM.\nThe Kibble-Zurek scalings are derived from the Landau critical velocity which\ndetermines the correlation length. In further, the critical exponents are\nnumerically extracted from the critical spatial-temporal dynamics of the\nbifurcation delay and the spontaneous vortex generation. Our study provides a\ngeneral way to explore and understand the spontaneous superfluidity breakdown\nin CPTs from a single-well dispersion to a double-well one, such as, BECs in\nsynthetic gauge fields, spin-orbit coupled BECs, and BECs in shaken optical\nlattices.\n", "  Kepler has discovered hundreds of systems with multiple transiting exoplanets\nwhich hold tremendous potential both individually and collectively for\nunderstanding the formation and evolution of planetary systems. Many of these\nsystems consist of multiple small planets with periods less than ~50 days known\nas Systems with Tightly-spaced Inner Planets, or STIPs. One especially\nintriguing STIP, Kepler-80 (KOI-500), contains five transiting planets: f, d,\ne, b, and c with periods of 1.0, 3.1, 4.6, 7.1, 9.5 days, respectively. We\nprovide measurements of transit times and a transit timing variation (TTV)\ndynamical analysis. We find that TTVs cannot reliably detect eccentricities for\nthis system, though mass estimates are not affected. Restricting the\neccentricity to a reasonable range, we infer masses for the outer four planets\n(d, e, b, and c) to be $6.75^{+0.69}_{-0.51}$, $4.13^{+0.81}_{-0.95}$,\n$6.93^{+1.05}_{-0.70}$, and $6.74^{+1.23}_{-0.86}$ Earth masses, respectively.\nThe similar masses but different radii are consistent with terrestrial\ncompositions for d and e and $\\sim$2% H/He envelopes for b and c. We confirm\nthat the outer four planets are in a rare dynamical configuration with four\ninterconnected three-body resonances that are librating with few degree\namplitudes. We present a formation model that can reproduce the observed\nconfiguration by starting with a multi-resonant chain and introducing\ndissipation. Overall, the information-rich Kepler-80 planets provide an\nimportant perspective into exoplanetary systems.\n", "  Multiple relaxation times detected in the ac magnetic susceptibility of\nseveral single-molecule magnets have been always assigned to extrinsic factors,\nsuch as nonequivalent magnetic centers or effects of intermolecular\ninteractions in the crystal. By solving quantum relaxation equations, we prove\nthat the observed multiple relaxation times can be of intramolecular origin and\ncan show up even in single-ion metal complexes. For the latter a remarkably\ngood description of the coexistent two relaxation times is demonstrated on\nseveral experimental examples. This proves the relevance of the intramolecular\nmechanism of multiple relaxation times in such systems, which is even easier\njustified in polynuclear magnetic complexes.\n", "  The Mott insulator $\\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$Ag$_2$(CN)$_3$ forms a\nhighly-frustrated triangular lattice of $S=1/2$ dimers with a possible\nquantum-spin-liquid state. Our experimental and numerical studies reveal the\nemergence of a slight charge imbalance between crystallographically\ninequivalent sites, relaxor dielectric response and hopping dc transport. In a\nbroader perspective we conclude that the universal properties of\nstrongly-correlated charge-transfer salts with spin liquid state are an\nanion-supported valence band and cyanide-induced quasi-degenerate electronic\nconfigurations in the relaxed state. The generic low-energy excitations are\ncaused by charged domain walls rather than by fluctuating electric dipoles.\nThey give rise to glassy dynamics characteristic of dimerized Mott insulators,\nincluding the sibling compound $\\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$Cu$_2$(CN)$_3$.\n", "  The usage of x-ray free electron laser (XFEL) in femtosecond\nnanocrystallography involves sequential illumination of many small crystals of\narbitrary orientation. Hence a wide radiation bandwidth will be useful in order\nto obtain and to index a larger number of Bragg peaks used for determination of\nthe crystal orientation. Considering the baseline configuration of the European\nXFEL in Hamburg, and based on beam dynamics simulations, we demonstrate here\nthat the usage of corrugated structures allows for a considerable increase in\nradiation bandwidth. Data collection with a 3% bandwidth, a few microjoule\nradiation pulse energy, a few femtosecond pulse duration, and a photon energy\nof 5.4 keV is possible. For this study we have developed an analytical modal\nrepresentation of the short-range wake function of the flat corrugated\nstructures for arbitrary offsets of the source and the witness particles.\n", "  We study indirect exchange interaction between magnetic impurities in the\n(001) CdTe/HgTe/CdTe symmetric quantum well. We consider low temperatures and\nthe case of the chemical potential placed in the energy gap of the 2D\nquasiparticle spectrum. We find that the indirect exchange interaction is\nsuppressed exponentially with the distance between magnetic impurities. The\npresence of inversion asymmetry results in oscillations of the indirect\nexchange interaction with the distance and generates additional terms which are\nnon-invariant under rotations in the (001) plane. The indirect exchange\ninteraction matrix has complicated structure with some terms proportional to\nthe sign of the energy gap.\n", "  We run simulations to determine the expected distribution of orbital elements\nof nearly isotropic comets (NICs) in the outer solar system, assuming that\nthese comets originate in the Oort Cloud at thousands of AU and are perturbed\ninto the planetary region by the Galactic tide. We show that the Large Synoptic\nSurvey Telescope (LSST) should detect and characterize the orbits of hundreds\nto thousands of NICs with perihelion distance outside 5 AU. Observing NICs in\nthe outer solar system is our only way of directly detecting comets from the\ninner Oort Cloud, as these comets are dynamically excluded from the inner solar\nsystem by the giant planets. Thus the distribution of orbital elements\nconstrains the spatial distribution of comets in the Oort cloud and the\nenvironment in which the solar system formed. Additionally, comet orbits can be\ncharacterized more precisely when they are seen far from the Sun as they have\nnot been affected by non-gravitational forces.\n", "  Robust knowledge of molecular gas mass is critical for understanding star\nformation in galaxies. The H$_{2}$ molecule does not emit efficiently in the\ncold interstellar medium, hence the molecular gas content of galaxies is\ntypically inferred using indirect tracers. At low metallicity and in other\nextreme environments, these tracers can be subject to substantial biases. We\npresent a new method of estimating total molecular gas mass in galaxies\ndirectly from pure mid-infrared rotational H$_{2}$ emission. By assuming a\npower-law distribution of H$_{2}$ rotational temperatures, we can accurately\nmodel H$_{2}$ excitation and reliably obtain warm ($T\\!\\gtrsim\\!100$ K) H$_{2}$\ngas masses by varying only the power law's slope. With sensitivities typical of\nSpitzer/IRS, we are able to directly probe the H$_{2}$ content via rotational\nemission down to ~80 K, accounting for ~15% of the total molecular gas mass in\na galaxy. By extrapolating the fitted power law temperature distributions to a\ncalibrated \\emph{single} lower cutoff temperature, the model also recovers the\ntotal molecular content within a factor of ~2.2 in a diverse sample of\ngalaxies, and a subset of broken power law models performs similarly well. In\nULIRGs, the fraction of warm H$_{2}$ gas rises with dust temperature, with some\ndependency on $\\alpha_\\mathrm{CO}$. In a sample of five low metallicity\ngalaxies ranging down to 12+log[O/H]=7.8, the model yields molecular masses up\nto ~100 times larger than implied by CO, in good agreement with other methods\nbased on dust mass and star formation depletion timescale. This technique\noffers real promise for assessing molecular content in the early universe where\nCO and dust-based methods may fail.\n", "  M87 is arguably the best supermassive black hole (BH) to explore the jet\nand/or accretion physics due to its proximity and fruitful high-resolution\nmulti-waveband observations. We model the multi-wavelength spectral energy\ndistribution (SED) of M87 core that observed at a scale of 0.4 arcsec ($\\sim\n10^5R_{\\rm g}$, $R_{\\rm g}$ is gravitational radius) as recently presented by\nPrieto et al. Similar to Sgr A*, we find that the millimeter bump as observed\nby Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) can be modeled by the\nsynchrotron emission of the thermal electrons in advection dominated accretion\nflow (ADAF), while the low-frequency radio emission and X-ray emission may\ndominantly come from the jet. The millimeter radiation from ADAF dominantly\ncome from the region within $10R_{\\rm g}$, which is roughly consistent with the\nrecent very long baseline interferometry observations at 230\\,GHz. We further\ncalculate the Faraday rotation measure (RM) from both ADAF and jet models, and\nfind that the RM predicted from the ADAF is roughly consistent with the\nmeasured value while the RM predicted from the jet is much higher if jet\nvelocity close to the BH is low or moderate (e.g., $v_{\\rm\njet}\\lesssim0.6\\,c$). With the constraints from the SED modeling and RM, we\nfind that the accretion rate close to the BH horizon is $\\sim\n(0.2-1)\\times10^{-3}{M}_{\\odot} \\rm yr^{-1}\\ll\\dot{\\it M}_{\\rm B}\\sim 0.2\\it\n{M}_{\\odot} \\rm yr^{-1}$ ($\\dot{M}_{\\rm B}$ is Bondi accretion rate), where the\nelectron density profile, $n_{\\rm e}\\propto r^{\\sim -1}$, in the accretion flow\nis consistent with that determined from X-ray observation inside the Bondi\nradius and recent numerical simulations.\n", "  A search is performed for a heavy particle decaying into different flavour\ndilepton pairs ($e\\mu$, $e\\tau$ or $\\mu\\tau$), using 3.2 $fb^{-1}$ of\nproton-proton collision data at $\\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV collected in 2015 by the\nATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider. No excess over the Standard Model\nprediction is observed. Limits at the 95% credibility level are set on the mass\nof a $Z^{\\prime}$ boson with lepton-flavour-violating couplings at 3.0, 2.7 and\n2.6 TeV, and on the mass of a supersymmetric $\\tau$ sneutrino with\n$R$-parity-violating couplings at 2.3, 2.2 and 1.9 TeV, for $e\\mu$, $e\\tau$ and\n$\\mu\\tau$ final states, respectively. The results are also interpreted as\nlimits on the threshold mass for quantum black hole production.\n", "  We study the photocurrent induced by pulsed-light illumination (pulse\nduration is several nanoseconds) of single-crystal diamond containing nitrogen\nimpurities. Application of additional continuous-wave light of the same\nwavelength quenches pulsed photocurrent. Characterization of the optically\nquenched photocurrent and its recovery is important for the development of\ndiamond based electronics and sensing.\n", "  PG1159 stars are hot, hydrogen-deficient (pre-) white dwarfs with atmospheres\nmainly composed of helium, carbon, and oxygen. The unusual surface chemistry is\nthe result of a late helium-shell flash. Observed element abundances enable us\nto test stellar evolution models quantitatively with respect to their\nnucleosynthesis products formed near the helium-burning shell of the progenitor\nasymptotic giant branch stars. Because of the high effective temperatures\n(Teff), abundance determinations require ultraviolet spectroscopy and non-local\nthermodynamic equilibrium model atmosphere analyses. Up to now, we have\npresented results for the prototype of this spectral class and two cooler\nmembers (Teff in the range 85,000-140,000 K). Here we report on the results for\ntwo even hotter stars (PG1520+525 and PG1144+005, both with Teff = 150,000 K)\nwhich are the only two objects in this temperature-gravity region for which\nuseful far-ultraviolet spectra are available, and revisit the prototype star.\nPrevious results on the abundances of some species are confirmed, while results\non others (Si, P, S) are revised. In particular, a solar abundance of sulphur\nis measured in contrast to earlier claims of a strong S deficiency that\ncontradicted stellar evolution models. For the first time, we assess the\nabundances of Na, Al, and Cl with newly constructed non-LTE model atoms.\nBesides the main constituents (He, C, O), we determine the abundances (or upper\nlimits) of N, F, Ne, Na, Al, Si, P, S, Cl, Ar, and Fe. Generally, good\nagreement with stellar models is found.\n", "  We use a recently developed model of relativistic meson-exchange currents to\ncompute the neutron-proton and proton-proton yields in $(\\nu_\\mu,\\mu^-)$\nscattering from $^{12}$C in the 2p-2h channel. We compute the response\nfunctions and cross sections with the relativistic Fermi gas model for\ndifferent kinematics from intermediate to high momentum transfers. We find a\nlarge contribution of neutron-proton configurations in the initial state, as\ncompared to proton-proton pairs. In the case of charge-changing neutrino\nscattering the 2p-2h cross section of proton-proton emission ({\\it i.e.,} np in\nthe initial state) is much larger than for neutron-proton emission ({\\it i.e.,}\ntwo neutrons in the initial state) by a $(\\omega,q)$-dependent factor. The\ndifferent emission probabilities of distinct species of nucleon pairs are\nproduced in our model only by meson-exchange currents, mainly by the $\\Delta$\nisobar current. We also analyze other effects including exchange contributions\nand the effect of the axial and vector currents.\n", "  We derive the flow equation for the gravitational effective average action in\nan $f(R)$ truncation on hyperbolic spacetimes using the exponential\nparametrization of the metric. In contrast to previous works on compact spaces,\nwe are able to evaluate traces exactly using the optimised cutoff. This reveals\nin particular that all modes can be integrated out for a finite value of the\ncutoff due to a gap in the spectrum of the Laplacian, leading to the effective\naction. Studying polynomial solutions, we find poorer convergence than has been\nfound on compact spacetimes even though at small curvature the equations only\ndiffer in the treatment of certain modes. In the vicinity of an asymptotically\nfree fixed point, we find the universal beta function for the $R^2$ coupling\nand compute the corresponding effective action which involves an $R^2 \\log R^2$\nquantum correction.\n", "  The partition function of 2d conformal field theory is a modular invariant\nfunction. It is known that the partition function of a holomorphic CFT whose\ncentral charge is a multiple of 24 is a polynomial in the Klein function. In\nthis paper, by using the medium temperature expansion we show that every\nmodular invariant partition function can be mapped to a holomorphic partition\nfunction whose structure can be determined similarly. We use this map to study\npartition function of CFTs with half-integer left and right conformal weights.\nWe show that the corresponding left and right central charges are necessarily\nmultiples of 4. Furthermore, the degree of degeneracy of high-energy levels can\nbe uniquely determined in terms of the degeneracy in the low energy states.\n", "  Near-infrared color-excess and extinction ratios are essential for\nestablishing the cosmic distance scale and probing the Galaxy, particularly\nwhen analyzing targets attenuated by significant dust. A robust determination\nof those ratios followed from leveraging new infrared observations from the VVV\nsurvey, wherein numerous bulge RR Lyrae and Type II Cepheids were discovered,\nin addition to $BVJHK_{s}(3.4\\rightarrow22)\\mu m$ data for classical Cepheids\nand O-stars occupying the broader Galaxy. The apparent optical color-excess\nratios vary significantly with Galactic longitude ($\\ell$), whereas the\nnear-infrared results are comparatively constant with $\\ell$ and Galactocentric\ndistance ($\\langle E(J-\\overline{3.5\\mu m})/E(J-K_s) \\rangle =1.28\\pm0.03$).\nThe results derived imply that classical Cepheids and O-stars display separate\noptical trends ($R_{V,BV}$) with $\\ell$, which appear to disfavor theories\nadvocating a strict and marked decrease in dust size with increasing\nGalactocentric distance. The classical Cepheid, Type II Cepheid, and RR Lyrae\nvariables are characterized by $\\langle A_{J}/E(J-K_s) \\rangle = \\langle\nR_{J,JK_s} \\rangle =1.49\\pm0.05$ ($\\langle A_{K_s}/A_J \\rangle =0.33\\pm0.02$),\nwhereas the O-stars are expectedly impacted by emission beyond $3.6 \\mu m$. The\nmean optical ratios characterizing classical Cepheids and O-stars are\napproximately $\\langle R_{V,BV} \\rangle \\sim3.1$ and $\\langle R_{V,BV} \\rangle\n\\sim3.3$, respectively.\n", "  We present results of an optical search for Cepheid variable stars using the\nHubble Space Telescope (HST) in 19 hosts of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) and the\nmaser-host galaxy NGC 4258, conducted as part of the SH0ES project (Supernovae\nand H0 for the Equation of State of dark energy). The targets include 9 newly\nimaged SN Ia hosts using a novel strategy based on a long-pass filter that\nminimizes the number of HST orbits required to detect and accurately determine\nCepheid properties. We carried out a homogeneous reduction and analysis of all\nobservations, including new universal variability searches in all SN Ia hosts,\nthat yielded a total of 2200 variables with well-defined selection criteria --\nthe largest such sample identified outside the Local Group. These objects are\nused in a companion paper to determine the local value of H0 with a total\nuncertainty of 2.4%.\n", "  We show that the relatively small but coincident excesses observed around 2\nTeV in the ATLAS Run 1 and Run 2 hadronic diboson searches --- when a cut on\nthe number of tracks in the fat jets is not applied --- and the null results of\nall remaining high-mass diboson searches are compatible with the decay of a\ntriboson resonance $R$ into $WZ$ plus an extra particle $X$. These decays can\ntake place via new neutral ($Y^0$) or charged ($Y^\\pm$) particles, namely $R\n\\to Y^0 \\, W$, with $Y^0 \\to Z X$, or $R \\to Y^\\pm Z$, with $Y^\\pm \\to W X$. An\nobvious candidate for such intermediate particle is a neutral one $Y^0$, given\na $3.9\\sigma$ excess found at 650 GeV by the CMS Collaboration in searches for\nintermediate mass diboson resonances decaying to $ZV$, with $V=W,Z$. We discuss\ndiscovery strategies for triboson resonances with small modifications of\nexisting hadronic searches.\n", "  We prove that the scattering equation formalism for Yang-Mills amplitudes can\nbe used to make manifest the theory's color-kinematics duality. This is\nachieved through a concrete reduction algorithm which renders this duality\nmanifest term-by-term. The reduction follows from the recently derived set of\nidentities for amplitudes expressed in the scattering equation formalism that\nare analogous to monodromy relations in string theory. A byproduct of our\nalgorithm is a generalization of the identities among gravity and Yang-Mills\namplitudes.\n", "  Theia is an astrometric mission proposed to ESA in 2014 for which one of the\nscientific objectives is detecting Earth-like exoplanets in the habitable zone\nof nearby solar-type stars. This objective requires the capability to measure\nstellar centroids at the precision of 1e-5 pixel. Current state-of-the-art\nmethods for centroid estimation have reached a precision of about 3e-5 pixel at\ntwo times Nyquist sampling, this was shown at the JPL by the VESTA experiment.\nA metrology system was used to calibrate intra and inter pixel quantum\nefficiency variations in order to correct pixelation errors. The Theia\nconsortium is operating a testbed in vacuum in order to achieve 1e-5 pixel\nprecision for the centroid estimation. The goal is to provide a proof of\nconcept for the precision requirement of the Theia spacecraft.\n  The testbed consists of two main sub-systems. The first one produces pseudo\nstars: a blackbody source is fed into a large core fiber and lights-up a\npinhole mask in the object plane, which is imaged by a mirror on the CCD. The\nsecond sub-system is the metrology, it projects young fringes on the CCD. The\nfringes are created by two single mode fibers facing the CCD and fixed on the\nmirror. In this paper we present the latest experiments conducted and the\nresults obtained after a series of upgrades on the testbed was completed. The\ncalibration system yielded the pixel positions to an accuracy estimated at 4e-4\npixel. After including the pixel position information, an astrometric accuracy\nof 6e-5 pixel was obtained, for a PSF motion over more than 5 pixels. In the\nstatic mode (small jitter motion of less than 1e-3 pixel), a photon noise\nlimited precision of 3e-5 pixel was reached.\n", "  The processes $e^{+}e^{-} \\rightarrow K^{\\pm} K^{*\\mp}(892)$ and $e^{+}e^{-}\n\\rightarrow \\eta \\phi(1020)$ are calculated in the framework of the extended\nNambu-Jona-Lasinio model. The intermediate vector mesons $\\rho(770),\n\\omega(782), \\phi(1020)$ and their first radially-excited states are taken into\naccount. The obtained results are in satisfactory agreement with the\nexperimental data. The predictions for the cross sections of the reactions\n$e^{+}e^{-} \\rightarrow K^{\\pm} K^{*\\mp}(1410)$, $e^{+}e^{-} \\rightarrow\n\\eta^{'}(958) \\phi(1020)$ and $e^{+}e^{-} \\rightarrow \\eta \\phi(1680)$ were\nmade.\n", "  We derive a theoretical model of mass and angular momentum scaling in type-II\ncritical collapse with rotation. We focus on the case where the critical\nsolution has precisely one, spherically symmetric, unstable mode. We\ndemonstrate excellent agreement with numerical results for critical collapse of\na rotating radiation fluid, which falls into this case.\n", "  The NASA Kepler mission has discovered thousands of new planetary candidates,\nmany of which have been confirmed through follow-up observations. A primary\ngoal of the mission is to determine the occurrance rate of terrestrial-size\nplanets within the Habitable Zone (HZ) of their host stars. Here we provide a\nlist of HZ exoplanet candidates from the Kepler Data Release 24 Q1-Q17 data\nvetting process. This work was undertaken as part of the Kepler Habitable Zone\nWorking Group. We use a variety of criteria regarding HZ boundaries and\nplanetary sizes to produce complete lists of HZ candidates, including a catalog\nof 104 candidates within the optimistic HZ and 20 candidates with radii less\nthan two Earth radii within the conservative HZ. We cross-match our HZ\ncandidates with the Data Release 25 stellar properties and confirmed planet\nproperties to provide robust stellar parameters and candidate dispositions. We\nalso include false positive probabilities recently calculated by Morton et al.\n(2016) for each of the candidates within our catalogs to aid in their\nvalidation. Finally, we performed dynamical analysis simulations for\nmulti-planet systems that contain candidates with radii less than two Earth\nradii as a step toward validation of those systems.\n", "  This project sought to consider two important aspects of the planetary nebula\nNGC 3242 using new long-slit HST/STIS spectra. First, we investigated whether\nthis object is chemically homogeneous by dividing the slit into different\nregions spatially and calculating the abundances of each region. The major\nresult is that the elements of He, C, O, and Ne are chemically homogeneous\nwithin uncertainties across the regions probed, implying that the stellar\noutflow was well-mixed. Second, we constrained the stellar properties using\nphotoionization models computed by CLOUDY and tested the effects of three\ndifferent density profiles on these parameters. The three profiles tested were\na constant density profile, a Gaussian density profile, and a Gaussian with a\npower law density profile. The temperature and luminosity were not affected\nsignificantly by the choice of density structure. The values for the stellar\ntemperature and luminosity from our best fit model are 89.7$^{+7.3}_{-4.7}$kK\nand log(L/Lsol)=3.36$^{+0.28}_{-0.22}$, respectively. Comparing to evolutionary\nmodels on an HR diagram, this corresponds to an initial and final mass of\n0.95$^{+0.35}_{-0.09}$ Msol and 0.56$^{+0.01}_{-0.01}$ Msol, respectively.\n", "  We present a finite-element method modeling of acoustophoretic devices\nconsisting of a single, long, straight, water-filled microchannel surrounded by\nan elastic wall of either borosilicate glass (pyrex) or the elastomer\npolydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and placed on top of a piezoelectric transducer\nthat actuates the device by surface acoustic waves (SAW). We compare the\nresulting acoustic fields in these full solid-fluid models with those obtained\nin reduced fluid models comprising of only a water domain with simplified,\napproximate boundary conditions representing the surrounding solids. The\nreduced models are found to only approximate the acoustically hard pyrex\nsystems to a limited degree for large wall thicknesses and not at all for the\nacoustically soft PDMS systems.\n", "  A large number of tidal disruption event (TDE) candidates have been observed\nrecently, often differing in their observational features. Two classes appear\nto stand out: X-ray and optical TDEs, the latter featuring lower effective\ntemperatures and luminosities. These differences can be explained if the\nradiation detected from the two categories of events originates from different\nlocations. In practice, this location is set by the evolution of the debris\nstream around the black hole and by the energy dissipation associated with it.\nIn this paper, we build an analytical model for the stream evolution, whose\ndynamics is determined by both magnetic stresses and shocks. Without magnetic\nstresses, the stream always circularizes. The ratio of the circularization\ntimescale to the initial stream period is $t_{\\rm ev}/t_{\\rm min} = 8.3 (M_{\\rm\nh}/10^6 M_{\\odot})^{-5/3} \\beta^{-3}$, where $M_{\\rm h}$ is the black hole mass\nand $\\beta$ is the penetration factor. If magnetic stresses are strong, they\ncan lead to the stream ballistic accretion. The boundary between\ncircularization and ballistic accretion corresponds to a critical magnetic\nstresses efficiency $v_{\\rm A}/v_{\\rm c} \\approx 10^{-1}$, largely independent\nof $M_{\\rm h}$ and $\\beta$. However, the main effect of magnetic stresses is to\naccelerate the stream evolution by strengthening self-crossing shocks.\nBallistic accretion therefore necessarily occurs on the stream dynamical\ntimescale. The shock luminosity associated to energy dissipation is\nsub-Eddington but decays as $t^{-5/3}$ only for a slow stream evolution.\nFinally, we find that the stream thickness rapidly increases if the stream is\nunable to cool completely efficiently. A likely outcome is its fast evolution\ninto a thick torus, or even an envelope completely surrounding the black hole.\n", "  We report on the observation of photogalvanic effects induced by terahertz\nradiation in type-II GaSb/InAs quantum wells with inverted band order.\nPhotocurrents are excited at oblique incidence of radiation and consists of\nseveral contributions varying differently with the change of the radiation\npolarization state; the one driven by the helicity and the other one driven by\nthe linearly polarization of radiation are of comparable magnitudes.\nExperimental and theoretical analyses reveal that the photocurrent is dominated\nby the circular and linear photogalvanic effects in a system with a dominant\nstructure inversion asymmetry. A microscopic theory developed in the framework\nof the Boltzmann equation of motion considers both photogalvanic effects and\ndescribes well all the experimental findings.\n", "  We present an improvement of the MC event generator Herwiri2, where we recall\nthe latter MC was a prototype for the inclusion of CEEX resummed EW corrections\nin hadron-hadron scattering at high cms energies. In this improvement the new\nexact ${\\cal O}(\\alpha^2L)$ resummed EW generator ${\\cal{KK}}$ MC 4.22,\nfeaturing as it does the CEEX realization of resummation in the EW sector, is\nput in union with the Herwig parton shower environment. The {\\rm LHE} format of\nthe attendant output event file means that all other conventional parton shower\nenvironments are available to the would-be user of the resulting new MC. For\nthis reason (and others -- see the text) we henceforth refer to the new\nimprovement of the Herwiri2 MC as ${\\cal{KK}}\\text{MC-hh}$. Since this new MC\nfeatures exact ${\\cal O}(\\alpha)$ pure weak corrections from the DIZET EW\nlibrary and features the CEEX and the EEX YFS-style resummation of large\nmultiple photon effects, it provides already the concrete path to 0.05\\%\nprecision on such effects if we focus on the EW effects themselves. We\ntherefore show predictions for observable distributions and comparisons with\nother approaches in the literature. This MC represents an important step in the\nrealization of the exact amplitude-based $QED\\otimes QCD$ resummation paradigm.\nIndependently of this latter observation, the MC rigorously quantifies\nimportant EW effects in the current LHC experiments.\n", "  We theoretically study the coupling of electric charge and spin polarization\nin an equilibrium and nonequilibrium electric transport across a two\ndimensional Josephson configuration comprised of disordered surface channels of\na three dimensional topological insulator. In the equilibriun state of the\nsystem we predict the Edelstein effect, which is much more pronounced than its\ncounterpart in conventional spin orbit coupled materials. Employing a\nquasiclassical Keldysh technique, we demonstrate that the ground state of\nsystem can be experimentally shifted into arbitrary macroscopic superconducting\nphase differences other than the standard `$0$' or `$\\pi$', constituting a\n$\\phi_0$-junction, solely by modulating a quasiparticle flow injection into the\njunction. We propose a feasible experiment where the quasiparticles are\ninjected into the topological insulator surface by means of a normal electrode\nand voltage gradient so that oppositely oriented stationary spin densities can\nbe developed along the interfaces and allow for directly making use of the\nspin-momentum locking nature of Dirac fermions in the surface channels. The\n$\\phi_0$-state is proportional to the voltage difference applied between the\ninjector electrode and superconducting terminals that calibrates the injection\nrate of particles and, therefore, the $\\phi_0$ shift.\n", "  This paper contains some new results on the hadronic light-by-light\ncontribution (HLbL) to the muon $g-2$. The first part argues that we can expect\nlarge effects from disconnected diagrams in present and future calculations by\nlattice QCD of HLbL. The argument is based on the dominance of pseudo-scalar\nmeson exchange.\n  In the second part, we revisit the pion loop HLbL contribution to the muon\nanomalous magnetic moment. We study it in the framework of some models studied\nearlier, pure pion loop, full VMD and hidden local symmetry for inclusion of\nvector mesons. In addition we study possible ways to include the axial-vector\nmeson. The main part of the work is a detailed study of how the different\nmomentum regions contribute. We derive a short distance constraint on the\n$\\gamma^*\\gamma^*\\to\\pi\\pi$ amplitude and use this as a constraint on the\nmodels used for the pion loop. As a byproduct we present the general result for\nintegration using the Gegenbauer polynomial method.\n", "  We investigate theoretically and experimentally the heteronuclear Efimov\nscenario for a three-body system that consists of two bosons and one\ndistinguishable particle with positive intraspecies scattering lengths. The\nthree-body parameter at the three-body scattering threshold and the scaling\nfactor between consecutive Efimov resonances are found to be controlled by the\nscattering length between the two bosons, approximately independent of\nshort-range physics. We observe two excited-state Efimov resonances in the\nthree-body recombination spectra of an ultracold mixture of fermionic $^6 $Li\nand bosonic $^{133} $Cs atoms close to a Li-Cs Feshbach resonance, where the\nCs-Cs interaction is positive. Deviation of the obtained scaling factor of\n4.0(3) from the universal prediction of 4.9 and the absence of the ground state\nEfimov resonance shed new light on the interpretation of the universality and\nthe discrete scaling behavior of heteronuclear Efimov physics.\n", "  We investigate unusual surface plasmons polariton (SPP) propagation and\nlight-matter interactions in ultrathin black phosphorus (BP) films, a 2D\nmaterial that exhibits exotic electrical and physical properties due to its\nextremely anisotropic crystal structure. Recently, it has been speculated that\nthe ultra-confined surface plasmons supported by BP may present various\ntopologies of wave propagation bands, ranging from anisotropic elliptic to\nhyperbolic, across the mid- and near-infrared regions of the electromagnetic\nspectrum. By carefully analyzing the natural nonlocal anisotropic optical\nconductivity of BP, derived using the Kubo formalism and an effective\nlow-energy Hamiltonian, we demonstrate here that the SPP wavenumber cutoff\nimposed by nonlocality prohibits that they acquire an arbitrary hyperbolic\ntopology, forcing operation in the canalization regime. The resulting\nnonlocality-induced canalization presents interesting properties, as it is\ninherently broadband, enables large light-matter interactions in the very near\nfield, and allows extreme device miniaturization. We also determine fundamental\nbounds to the confinement of BP plasmons, which are significantly weaker than\nfor graphene, thus allowing a larger local density of states. Our results\nconfirm the potential of BP as a promising reconfigurable plasmonic platform,\nwith exciting applications, such as planar hyperlenses, optoelectronic\ncomponents, imaging, and communication systems.\n", "  We construct $\\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetric nonlocal theories in four\ndimension. We discuss higher derivative extensions of chiral and vector\nsuperfields, and write down generic forms of K\\\"ahler potential and\nsuperpotential up to quadratic order. We derive the condition in which an\nauxiliary field remains non-dynamical, and the dynamical scalars and fermions\nare free from the ghost degrees of freedom. We also investigate the nonlocal\neffects on the supersymmetry breaking and find that supertrace (mass) formula\nis significantly modified even at the tree level.\n", "  Deceleration of relativistic jets from active galactic nuclei (AGNs) detected\nrecently by MOJAVE team is discussed in connection with the interaction of the\njet material with the external photon field. Appropriate energy density of the\nisotropic photon field which is necessary to decelerate jets is determined. It\nis shown that the disturbances of the electric potential and magnetic surfaces\nplay important role in general dynamics of particle deceleration.\n", "  We consider the simplest realization of leptogenesis with one heavy Majorana\nneutrino species much lighter than the other ones. In this scenario, when the\ntemperature of the early universe is smaller than the lightest Majorana\nneutrino mass, we compute at first order in the Standard Model couplings and,\nfor each coupling, at leading order in the termperature the CP asymmetry in the\ndecays of the lightest neutrino into leptons and anti-leptons. We perform the\ncalculation using a hierarchy of two effective field theories organized as\nexpansions in the inverse of the heavy-neutrino masses. In the ultimate\neffective field theory, leading thermal corrections proportional to the Higgs\nself coupling and the gauge couplings are encoded in one single operator of\ndimension five, whereas corrections proportional to the top Yukawa coupling are\nencoded in four operators of dimension seven, which we compute.\n", "  We present a combined theoretical and experimental study of the energetic\nstability and accessibility of different domain wall spin configurations in\nmesoscopic magnetic iron rings. The evolution is investigated as a function of\nthe width and thickness in a regime of relevance to devices, while Fe is chosen\nas a material due to its simple growth in combination with attractive magnetic\nproperties including high saturation magnetization and low intrinsic\nanisotropy. Micromagnetic simulations are performed to predict the lowest\nenergy states of the domain walls, which can be either the transverse or vortex\nwall spin structure, in good agreement with analytical models, with simulations\nrevealing the expected low temperature configurations observable on relaxation\nof the magnetic structure from saturation in an external field. In the latter\ncase, following the domain wall nucleation process, transverse domain walls are\nfound at larger widths and thicknesses than would be expected by comparing the\ncompeting energy terms demonstrating the importance of metastability of the\nstates. The simulations are compared to high resolution experimental images of\nthe magnetization using scanning electron microscopy with polarization analysis\nto provide a phase diagram of the various spin configurations. In addition to\nthe vortex and simple symmetric transverse domain wall, a significant range of\ngeometries are found to exhibit highly asymmetric transverse domain walls with\nproperties distinct from the symmetric transverse wall. Simulations of the\nasymmetric walls reveal an evolution of the domain wall tilting angle with ring\nthickness. Analysis of all the data reveals that in addition to the geometry,\nthe influence of materials properties, defects and thermal activation all need\nto be taken into account in order to understand and reliably control the\nexperimentally accessible states, as needed for devices.\n", "  We present a simple diagnostic that can be used to constrain the location of\nthe differential rotation in red giants with measured mixed mode rotational\nsplittings. Specifically, in red giants with radii $\\sim 4R_\\odot$, the\nsplittings of p-dominated modes (sound wave dominated) relative to those of\ng-dominated modes (internal gravity wave dominated) are sensitive to how much\nof the differential rotation resides in the outer convection zone versus the\nradiative interior of the red giant. An independently measured surface rotation\nrate significantly aids breaking degeneracies in interpreting the measured\nsplittings. We apply our results to existing observations of red giants,\nparticularly those of Kepler-56, and find that most of the differential\nrotation resides in the radiative region rather than in the convection zone.\nThis conclusion is consistent with results in the literature from rotational\ninversions, but our results are insensitive to some of the uncertainties in the\ninversion process and can be readily applied to large samples of red giants\nwith even a modest number of measured rotational splittings. We argue that\ndifferential rotation in the radiative interior strongly suggests that angular\nmomentum transport in red giants is dominated by local fluid instabilities\nrather than large-scale magnetic stresses.\n", "  We discuss the transformation of observed photometry into flux for the\ncreation of spectral energy distributions and the computation of bolometric\nluminosities. We do this in the context of supernova studies, particularly as\nobserved with the Swift spacecraft, but the concepts and techniques should be\napplicable to many other types of sources and wavelength regimes. Traditional\nmethods of converting observed magnitudes to flux densities are not very\naccurate when applied to UV photometry. Common methods for extinction and the\nintegration of pseudo-bolometric fluxes can also lead to inaccurate results.\nThe sources of inaccuracy, though, also apply to other wavelengths. Because of\nthe complicated nature of translating broad-band photometry into monochromatic\nflux densities, comparison between observed photometry and a spectroscopic\nmodel is best done by comparing in the natural units of the observations. We\nrecommend that integrated flux measurements be made using a spectrum or\nspectral energy distribution which is consistent with the multi-band photometry\nrather than converting individual photometric measurements to flux densities,\nlinearly interpolating between the points, and integrating. We also highlight\nsome specific areas where the UV flux can be mischaracterized.\n", "  The reaction $e^+e^- \\to \\bar \\Lambda \\Lambda$ is investigated for energies\nclose to the threshold. Specific emphasis is put on the role played by the\ninteraction in the final $\\bar \\Lambda \\Lambda$ system which is taken into\naccount rigorously. For that interaction a variety of $\\bar \\Lambda \\Lambda$\npotential models is employed that have been constructed for the analysis of the\nreaction $\\bar p p \\to \\bar \\Lambda \\Lambda$ in the past. The enhancement of\nthe effective form factor for energies close to the $\\bar \\Lambda \\Lambda$\nthreshold, seen in pertinent experiments, is reproduced. Predictions for the\n$\\Lambda$ electromagnetic form factors $G_M$ and $G_E$ in the timelike region\nand for spin-dependent observables such as spin-correlation parameters are\npresented.\n", "  We perform several tests on a recent proposal by Shifman and Stepanyantz for\nan exact expression for the current correlation functions in supersymmetric\ngauge theories. We clarify the meaning of the relation in superconformal\ntheories. In particular we show that it automatically follows from known\nrelations between the current correlation functions and anomalies. It therefore\nalso automatically matches between different dual realizations of the same\nsuperconformal theory. We use holographic examples as well as calculations in\nfree theories to show that the proposed relation fails in theories with mass\nterms.\n", "  Motivated by the goal of realizing topological phases in thin films and\nheterostructures of correlated oxides, we propose here a quantum anomalous Hall\ninsulator (QAHI) in ultrathin films of double perovskites based on mixed 3d-5d\nor 3d-4d transition metal ions, grown along the [111] direction. Considering\nthe specific case of ultrathin Ba2FeReO6, we present a theoretical analysis of\nan effective Hamiltonian derived from first-principles. We establish that a\nstrong spin-orbit coupling at Re site, t2g symmetry of the low-energy d-bands,\npolarity of its [111] orientation of perovskite structure, and mixed 3d-5d\nchemistry results in room temperature magnetism with a robust QAHI state of\nChern number C=1 and a large band-gap. We uncover and highlight a\nnon-relativistic orbital-Rashba-type effect in addition to the spin-orbit\ncoupling, that governs this QAHI state. Our prediction of a large topological\nband-gap of ~100 meV in electronic structure, and a magnetic transition\ntemperature Tc~300K estimated by Monte Carlo simulations, is expected to\nstimulate experimental efforts at synthesis of such films and enable possible\npractical applications of its dissipationless edge currents.\n", "  The design, construction and performance characteristics of a simple\naxial-field ionization chamber suitable for identifying ions in a radioactive\nbeam are presented. Optimized for use with low-energy radioactive beams (< 5\nMeV/A) the detector presents only three 0.5 $\\mu$m/cm$^2$ foils to the beam in\naddition to the detector gas. A fast charge sensitive amplifier (CSA)\nintegrated into the detector design is also described. Coupling this fast CSA\nto the axial field ionization chamber produces an output pulse with a risetime\nof 60-70 ns and a fall time of 100 ns, making the detector capable of\nsustaining a relatively high rate. Tests with an $\\alpha$ source establish the\ndetector energy resolution as $\\sim$8 $\\%$ for an energy deposit of $\\sim$3.5\nMeV. The energy resolution with beams of 2.5 and 4.0 MeV/A $^{39}$K ions and\nthe dependence of the energy resolution on beam intensity is measured. At an\ninstantaneous rate of 3 x 10$^5$ ions/s the energy resolution has degraded to\n14% with a pileup of 12%. The good energy resolution of this detector at rates\nup to 3 x 10$^5$ ions/s makes it an effective tool in the characterization of\nlow-energy radioactive beams.\n", "  Here, we peruse cosmological usage of the most promising candidates of dark\nenergy in the framework of $f(T)$ gravity theory. We reconstruct the different\n$f(T)$ modifed gravity models in the spatially flat FRW universe according to\nentropy-corrected versions of the holographic and new agegraphic dark energy\nmodels in power-law and logarithmic corrections, which describe accelerated\nexpansion history of the universe. We conclude that the equation of state\nparameter of the entropy-corrected models can transit from quintessence state\nto phantom regime as indicated by recent observations or can lie entirely in\nthe phantom region. Also, using these models, we investigate the different\nerase of the stability with the help of the squared speed of sound.\n", "  We numerically propose a scheme for realizing an all-optical femtosecond\nsoliton diode based on a tailored heterojunction Bragg grating, which is\ndesigned by two spatially asymmetric chirped cholesteric liquid crystals. Our\nsimulations demonstrate that with the consideration of optical nonlinearity,\nnot only the femtosecond diode effect with nonreciprocal transmission ratio up\nto 120 can be achieved, but also the optical pulse evolving into soliton which\nmaintains its shape during propagation through the sample is observed. Further,\nthe influence of pulse width and the carrier wavelength to the femtosecond\ndiode effect is also discussed in detail. Our demonstrations might suggest a\nnew direction for experimentally realizing the femtosecond soliton diode based\non the cholesteric liquid crystals.\n", "  We formulate the lunar cratering distribution and verify the cratering\nasymmetries generated by the main-belt asteroids (MBAs) as well as the\nnear-Earth objects (NEOs).\n  Based on a planar model that excludes the terrestrial and lunar gravitations\non the impactors and assuming the impactor encounter speed with Earth\n$v_{\\rm{enc}}$ is higher than the lunar orbital speed $v_{\\rm{M}}$, we\nrigorously integrated the lunar cratering distribution, and derived its\napproximation to the first order of $v_{\\rm{M}}/v_{\\rm{enc}}$. Numerical\nsimulations of lunar bombardment by the MBAs during the late heavy bombardment\nwere performed with an Earth-Moon distance $a_{\\rm{M}}$ = 20--60 Earth radii in\nfive cases.\n  The analytical model directly proves the existence of a leading/trailing\nasymmetry and the absence of near/far asymmetry. The approximate form of the\nleading/trailing asymmetry is $(1 + A_1 \\cos\\beta)$, which decreases as the\napex distance $\\beta$ increases. The numerical simulations show evidence of a\npole/equator asymmetry as well as the leading/trailing asymmetry, and the\nformer is empirically described as $(1 + A_2 \\cos2\\varphi)$, which decreases as\nthe latitude modulus $|\\varphi|$ increases. The amplitudes $A_{1,2}$ are\nreliable measurements of asymmetries. Our analysis explicitly indicates the\nquantitative relations between cratering distribution and bombardment\nconditions (impactor properties and the lunar orbital status) like $A_1 \\propto\nv_{\\rm{M}}/v_{\\rm{enc}}$, resulting in a method for reproducing the bombardment\nconditions through measuring the asymmetry. Mutual confirmation between\nanalytical model and numerical simulations is found in terms of the cratering\ndistribution and its variation with $a_{\\rm{M}}$. Estimates of $A_1$ for crater\ndensity distributions generated by the MBAs and the NEOs are 0.101--0.159 and\n0.117, respectively.\n", "  The presence of the ancient valley networks on Mars indicates that the\nclimate at 3.8 Ga was warm enough to allow substantial liquid water to flow on\nthe martian surface for extended periods of time. However, the mechanism for\nproducing this warming continues to be debated. One hypothesis is that Mars\ncould have been kept warm by global cirrus cloud decks in a CO2-H2O atmosphere\ncontaining at least 0.25 bar of CO2 (Urata and Toon, 2013). Initial warming\nfrom some other process, e.g., impacts, would be required to make this model\nwork. Those results were generated using the CAM 3-D global climate model.\nHere, we use a single-column radiative-convective climate model to further\ninvestigate the cirrus cloud warming hypothesis. Our calculations indicate that\ncirrus cloud decks could have produced global mean surface temperatures above\nfreezing, but only if cirrus cloud cover approaches ~75 - 100% and if other\ncloud properties (e.g., height, optical depth, particle size) are chosen\nfavorably. However, at more realistic cirrus cloud fractions, or if cloud\nparameters are not optimal, cirrus clouds do not provide the necessary warming,\nsuggesting that other greenhouse mechanisms are needed.\n", "  We present a detailed investigation of the exciton and trion dynamics in\nnaturally doped MoSe2 and WSe2 single atomic layers as a function of\ntemperature in the range 10-300K under above band-gap laser excitation. By\ncombining time-integrated and time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy\nwe show the importance of exciton and trion localization in both materials at\nlow temperatures. We also reveal the transition to delocalized exciton\ncomplexes at higher temperatures where the exciton and trion thermal energy\nexceeds the typical localization energy. This is accompanied with strong\nchanges in PL including suppression of the trion PL and decrease of the trion\nPL life-time, as well as significant changes for neutral excitons in the\ntemperature dependence of the PL intensity and appearance of a pronounced slow\nPL decay component. In MoSe2 and WSe2 studied here, the temperatures where such\nstrong changes occur are observed at around 100 and 200 K, respectively, in\nagreement with their inhomogeneous PL linewidth of 8 and 20 meV at T~10K. The\nobserved behavior is a result of a complex interplay between influences of the\nspecific energy ordering of bright and dark excitons in MoSe2 and WSe2, sample\ndoping, trion and exciton localization and various temperature-dependent\nnon-radiative processes.\n", "  We have developed and implemented a low-cost peer-mentoring program that\nblends personal and academic support to help students achieve academic success\nin the introductory courses required for the Physics Major or the Dual-Degree\nProgram in Engineering. As a result of this program, retention has increased\namong entering science, technology, engineering and mathematics students at\nAlbion College as they move through the introductory classes, as shown by a 20\nper cent increase in retention from first-semester to third-semester physics\ncourses compared to years when this program was not in place.\n", "  We examine the processes triggering star formation and Active Galactic\nNucleus (AGN) activity in a sample of 25 low redshift ($z<0.13$) gas-rich\ngalaxy mergers observed at milli-arcsecond resolution with Very Long Baseline\nInterferometry as part of the mJy Imaging VLBA Exploration at 20cm (mJIVE-20)\nsurvey. The high ($>10^7$ K) brightness temperature required for an mJIVE-20\ndetection allows us to unambiguously identify the radio AGN in our sample. We\nfind three such objects. Our VLBI AGN identifications are classified as\nSeyferts or LINERs in narrow line optical diagnostic plots; mid-infrared\ncolours of our targets and the comparison of H$\\alpha$ star formation rates\nwith integrated radio luminosity are also consistent with the VLBI\nidentifications. We reconstruct star formation histories in our galaxies using\noptical and UV photometry, and find that these radio AGN are not triggered\npromptly in the merger process, consistent with previous findings for non-VLBI\nsamples of radio AGN. This delay can significantly limit the efficiency of\nfeedback by radio AGN triggered in galaxy mergers. We find that radio AGN hosts\nhave lower star formation rates than non-AGN radio-selected galaxies at the\nsame starburst age. Conventional and VLBI radio imaging shows these AGN to be\ncompact on arcsecond scales. Our modeling suggests that the actual sizes of\nAGN-inflated radio lobes may be much larger than this, but these are too faint\nto be detected in existing observations. Deep radio imaging is required to map\nout the true extent of the AGN, and to determine whether the low star formation\nrates in radio AGN hosts are a result of the special conditions required for\nradio jet triggering, or the effect of AGN feedback.\n", "  We present a generalization of the six-dimensional (2,0) system of\narXiv:1007.2982 to include a constant abelian 3-form. For vanishing 3-form this\nsystem is known to provide a variety descriptions of parallel M5-branes. For a\nparticular choice of 3-form the system is shown to reduce to that of two\nM2-branes. Thus this generalised (2,0) system provides a unified description of\ntwo parallel M2-branes or M5-branes.\n", "  We compare predictions of a number of empirical models and numerical\nsimulations of galaxy formation to the conditional stellar mass functions\n(CSMF)of galaxies in groups of different masses obtained recently by Lan et al.\nto test how well different models accommodate the data. The observational data\nclearly prefer a model in which star formation in low-mass halos changes\nbehavior at a characteristic redshift $z_c\\sim 2$. There is also tentative\nevidence that this characteristic redshift depends on environment, becoming\n$z_c\\sim 4$ in regions that eventually evolve into rich clusters of galaxies.\nThe constrained model is used to understand how galaxies form and evolve in\ndark matter halos, and to make predictions for other statistical properties of\nthe galaxy population, such as the stellar mass functions of galaxies at high\n$z$, the star formation and stellar mass assembly histories in dark matter\nhalos. A comparison of our model predictions with those of other empirical\nmodels shows that different models can make vastly different predictions, even\nthough all of them are tuned to match the observed stellar mass functions of\ngalaxies.\n", "  The martensitic transformation in Ni$_{2}$Mn$_{1+x}$Sn$_{1-x}$ alloys has\nbeen investigated within ab-initio density functional theory. The experimental\ntrend of a martensitic transition happening beyond $x$ = 0.36 is captured\nwithin these calculations. The microscopic considerations leading to this are\ntraced to increased Ni-Mn hybridization which results from the Ni atom\nexperiencing a resultant force along a lattice parameter and moving towards the\nMn atoms above a critical concentration. The presence of the lone pair\nelectrons on Sn forces the movement of Ni atoms away from Sn. While band Jahn\nTeller effects have been associated with this transition, we show\nquantitatively that atleast in this class of compounds they have a minor role.\n", "  We discuss possible instabilities in higher-derivative matter fields\ntheories. These theories has two free parameters $\\beta_1$ and $\\beta_4$. By\nusing dynamical system approach we explicitly demonstrate that for stability of\nMinkowski space in expanding Universe it is need condition $\\beta_4<0$. By\nusing quantum field theory approach we also find additional restriction for\nparameters $\\beta_1>-\\frac{1}{3}\\beta_4$ which is need to avoid tachyon-like\ninstability.\n", "  We perform ultrahigh resolution angle-resolved photoemission experiments at a\ntemperature T=0.8 K on the type-II Weyl semimetal candidate WTe$_{2}$. We find\na surface Fermi arc connecting the bulk electron and hole pockets on the (001)\nsurface. Our results show that the surface Fermi arc connectivity to the bulk\nbands is strongly mediated by distinct surface resonances dispersing near the\nborder of the surface-projected bulk band gap. By comparing the experimental\nresults to first-principles calculations we argue that the coupling to these\nsurface resonances, which are topologically trivial, is compatible with the\nclassification of WTe$_{2}$ as a type-II Weyl semimetal hosting topological\nFermi arcs. We further support our conclusion by a systematic characterization\nof the bulk and surface character of the different bands and discuss the\nsimilarity of our findings to the case of topological insulators.\n", "  We theoretically show that a locally-embedded Rashba interaction acts as a\nstrong pinning center for current-driven domain walls and demonstrate efficient\ncapturing and depinning of the wall using a weak Rashba interaction of the\norder of 0.01 eV{\\AA}. Our discovery is expected to be useful for the highly\nreliable control of domain walls in racetrack memories.\n", "  The source 4U 1901+03 is a high-mass X-ray pulsar than went into outburst in\n2003. Observation performed with the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer showed\nspectral and timing variability, including the detection of flares,\nquasi-periodic oscillations, complex changes in the pulse profiles, and pulse\nphase dependent spectral variability. We re-analysed the data covering the 2003\nX-ray outburst and focused on several aspects of the variability that have not\nbeen discussed so far. These are the 10 keV feature and the X-ray spectral\nstates and their association with accretion regimes, including the transit to\nthe propeller state at the end of the outburst. We find that 4U 1901+03 went\nthrough three accretion regimes over the course of the X-ray outburst. At the\npeak of the outburst and for a very short time, the X-ray flux may have\novercome the critical limit that marks the formation of a radiative shock at a\ncertain distance above the neutron star surface. Most of the time, however, the\nsource is in the subcritical regime. Only at the end of the outburst, when the\nluminosity decreased below ~10^{36} (d/10 kpc)^2 erg/s, did the source enter\nthe propeller regime. Evidence for the existence of these regimes comes from\nthe pulse profiles, the shape of the hardness-intensity diagram, and the\ncorrelation of various spectral parameters with the flux. The 10 keV feature\nappears to strongly depend on the X-ray flux and on the pulse phase, which\nopens the possibility to interpret this feature as a cyclotron line.\n", "  A new concept of nonlinear focusing of colliding bunches, called Crab Waist\n(CW)collision scheme, has been proposed at LNF INFN. It has been successfully\ntested at the Italian lepton collider DAFNE in operational conditions providing\nluminosity for two different experimental detectors, SIDDHARTA and KLOE-2.\nConsidering a high efficiency of the scheme for increasing collision luminosity\nand its relative simplicity for implementation several new collider projects\nhave been proposed and are under development at present. These are the\nSuperKEKB B-factory ready to start commissioning in 2016 in Japan, the\nSuperC-Tau factory proposed in Novosibirsk and entered in the short list of\nRussian mega-science projects, the new 100-km electron-positron Future Circular\nCollider (FCC-ee) under design study at CERN and some others. In this paper we\ndescribe the CW collision scheme, discuss its advantages and report principal\nresults achieved at the electron-positron Phi-factory DAFNE.\n", "  The influence of the center of mass motion of a trapped two level system on\nefficient resonant single photon absorption is investigated. It is shown that\nthis absorption process depends strongly on the ratio between the\ncharacteristic time scales of spontaneous photon emission and of the two level\nsystem's center of mass motion. In particular, if the spontaneous photon\nemission process occurs almost instantaneously on the time scale of the center\nof mass motion coherent control of the center of mass motion offers interesting\nperspectives for optimizing single photon absorption. It is demonstrated that\nthis way time dependent modulation of a harmonic trapping frequency allows to\nsqueeze the two level system's center of mass motion so strongly that high\nefficient single photon absorption is possible even in cases of weak\nconfinement by a trapping potential.\n", "  We revisit the non-sphericity of cluster-mass scale halos from cosmological\nN-body simulation on the basis of triaxial modelling. In order to understand\nthe difference between the simulation results and the conventional ellipsoidal\ncollapse model (EC), we first consider the evolution of individual simulated\nhalos. The major difference between EC and the simulation becomes appreciable\nafter the turn-around epoch. Moreover, it is sensitive to the individual\nevolution history of each halo. Despite such strong dependence on individual\nhalos, the resulting nonsphericity of halos exhibits weak but robust mass\ndependence in a statistical fashion; massive halos are more spherical up to the\nturn-around, but gradually become less spherical by z = 0. This is clearly\ninconsistent with the EC prediction; massive halos are usually more spherical.\nIn addition, at z=0, inner regions of the halos are less spherical than outer\nregions, i.e., the density distribution inside the halos is highly\ninhomogeneous and therefore not self-similar. Since most of previous fitting\nformulae for the PDF of axis ratio of triaxial ellipsoids have been constructed\nunder the self-similarity assumption, they are not accurate. Indeed, we compute\nthe PDF of projected axis ratio a1/a2 directly from the simulation data without\nthe self-similarity assumption, and find that it is very sensitive to the\nassumption. The latter needs to be carefully taken into account in direct\ncomparison with observations, and therefore we provide an empirical fitting\nformula for the PDF of a1/a2. Our preliminary analysis suggests that the\nderived PDF of a1/a2 roughly agrees with the current weak-lensing observations.\nMore importantly, the present results will be useful in future exploration of\nthe non-sphericity of clusters in X-ray and optical observations.\n", "  Transition probability calculations of strong field particle processes in the\nFurry picture, typically use fermion Volkov solutions. These solutions have a\nrelatively complicated spinor due to the interaction of the electron spin with\na strong external field, which in turn leads to unwieldy trace calculations.\nThe simplification of these calculations would aid theoretical studies of\nstrong field phenomena such as the predicted resonance behaviour of higher\norder Furry picture processes. Here, Fierz transformations of Volkov spinors\nare developed and applied to a 1st order and a 2nd order Furry picture process.\nCombined with symmetry properties, the techniques presented here are generally\napplicable and lead to considerable simplification of Furry picture analytic\ncalculations.\n", "  Vortex electron beams are freely propagating electron waves carrying\nadjustable orbital angular momentum with respect to the propagation direction.\nSuch beams were experimentally realized just a few years ago and are now used\nto probe various electromagnetic processes. So far, these experiments used the\nsingle vortex electron beams, either propagating in external fields or\nimpacting a target. Here, we investigate the elastic scattering of two such\naligned vortex electron beams and demonstrate that this process allows one to\nexperimentally measure features which are impossible to detect in the usual\nplane-wave scattering. The scattering amplitude of this process is well\napproximated by two plane-wave scattering amplitudes with different momentum\ntransfers, which interfere and give direct experimental access to the Coulomb\nphase. This phase (shift) affects the scattering of all charged particles and\nhas thus received significant theoretical attention but was never probed\nexperimentally. We show that a properly defined azimuthal asymmetry, which has\nno counterpart in plane-wave scattering, allows one to directly measure the\nCoulomb phase as function of the scattering angle.\n", "  We point out that a hypothesis of squarks and sleptons being Nambu-Goldstone\n(NG) bosons is consistent with pure gravity mediation or minimal split\nsupersymmetry (SUSY). As a concrete example, we consider a SUSY $E_7/SU(5)\n\\times U(1)^3$ non-linear sigma model in the framework of pure gravity\nmediation. The model accommodates three families of the quark and lepton chiral\nmultiplets as (pseudo) NG multiplets of the Kahler manifold, which may enable\nus to understand the origin and number of the families. We point out that\nsquarks in the first and second generations are likely to be as light as a few\nTeV if the observed baryon asymmetry is explained by the thermal leptogenesis;\ntherefore, these colored particles can be discovered at the LHC Run-2 or at the\nhigh luminosity LHC.\n", "  Magnetic skyrmions have been receiving growing attention as potential\ninformation storage and magnetic logic devices since an increasing number of\nmaterials have been identified that support skyrmion phases. Explorations of\nartificial frustrated systems have led to new insights into controlling and\nengineering new emergent frustration phenomena in frustrated and disordered\nsystems. Here, we propose a skyrmion spin ice, giving a unifying framework for\nthe study of geometric frustration of skyrmion crystals in a non-frustrated\nartificial geometrical lattice as a consequence of the structural confinement\nof skyrmions in magnetic potential wells. The emergent ice rules from the\ngeometrically frustrated skyrmion crystals highlight a novel phenomenon in this\nskyrmion system: emergent geometrical frustration. We demonstrate how skyrmion\ncrystal topology transitions between a non-frustrated periodic configuration\nand a frustrated ice-like ordering can also be realized reversibly. The\nproposed artificial frustrated skyrmion systems can be annealed into different\nice phases with an applied current induced spin-transfer torque, including a\nlong range ordered ice rule obeying ground state, as-relaxed random state,\nbiased state and monopole state. The spin-torque reconfigurability of the\nartificial skyrmion ice states, difficult to achieve in other artificial spin\nice systems, is compatible with standard spintronic device fabrication\ntechnology, which makes the semiconductor industrial integration\nstraightforward.\n", "  We study the general formalism of polytropes in relativistic regime with\ngeneralized polytropic equations of state in the vicinity of cylindrical\nsymmetry. We take charged anisotropic fluid distribution of matter with\nconformally flat condition for the development of general framework of\npolytropes. We discussed the stability of the model by Whittaker formula and\nconcluded that one of the developed model is physically viable.\n", "  Nearby active galactic nuclei were diagnosed in the X-ray and mid-to-far\ninfrared wavelengths, with Monitor of All-sky X-ray Image (MAXI) and the\nJapanese infrared observatory AKARI, respectively. Among the X-ray sources\nlisted in the second release of the MAXI all-sky X-ray source catalog, 100 ones\nare currently identified as a non-blazar-type active galactic nucleus. These\ninclude 95 Seyfert galaxies and 5 quasars, and they are composed of 73 type-1\nand 27 type-2 objects. The AKARI all-sky survey point source catalog was\nsearched for their mid- and far-infrared counterparts at 9, 18, and 90 $\\mu$m.\nAs a result, 69 Seyfert galaxies in the MAXI catalog (48 type-1 and 21 type-2\nones) were found to be detected with AKARI. The X-ray (3-4 keV and 4-10 keV)\nand infrared luminosities of these objects were investigated, together with\ntheir color information. Adopting the canonical photon index, $\\Gamma = 1.9$,\nof the intrinsic X-ray spectrum of the Seyfert galaxies, the X-ray hardness\nratio between the 3-4 and 4-10 keV ranges derived with MAXI was roughly\nconverted into the absorption column density. After the X-ray luminosity was\ncorrected for absorption from the estimated column density, the well-known\nX-ray-to-infrared luminosity correlation was confirmed at least in the\nCompton-thin regime. In contrast, NGC 1365, only one Compton-thick object in\nthe MAXI catalog, was found to deviate from the correlation toward a\nsignificantly lower X-ray luminosity by nearly an order of magnitude. It was\nverified that the relation between the X-ray hardness below 10 keV and\nX-ray-to-infrared color acts as an effective tool to pick up Compton-thick\nobjects. The difference in the infrared colors between the type-1 and type-2\nSeyfert galaxies and its physical implication on the classification and\nunification of active galactic nuclei were briefly discussed.\n", "  Perturbed angular correlation (PAC) measurements using the In-111 probe were\ncarried out on FeGa3 as part of a broader investigation of indium site\noccupation and cadmium diffusion in intermetallic compounds. One PAC signal was\nobserved with hyperfine parameters w1 = 513.8(1) Mrad/s and eta = 0.939(2) at\nroom temperature. By comparison with quadrupole frequencies observed in PAC\nmeasurements on isostructural RuIn3, it was determined that indium occupies\nonly the 8j site in the FeGa3 structure, denoted Ga(2) below because two out of\nthe three Ga sites have this point symmetry. PAC spectra at elevated\ntemperature exhibited damping characteristic of electric field gradients (EFGs)\nthat fluctuate as Cd probes jump among Ga(2) sites within the lifetime of the\nexcited PAC level. A stochastic model for the EFG fluctuations based on four\nconceivable, single-step jump-pathways connecting one Ga(2) site to neighboring\nGa(2) sites was developed and used to fit PAC spectra. The four pathways lead\nto two observable EFG reorientation rates, and these reorientation rates were\nfound to be strongly dependent on EFG orientation. Calculations using density\nfunctional theory were used to reduce the number of unknowns in the model with\nrespect to EFG orientation. This made it possible to determine with reasonable\nprecision the total jump rate of Cd among Ga(2) sites that correspond to a\nchange in mirror plane orientation of site-symmetry. This total jump rate was\nfound to be thermally activated with an activation enthalpy of 1.8(1) eV.\n", "  We describe a protocol to prepare clusters of ultracold bosonic atoms in\nstrongly-interacting states reminiscent of fractional quantum Hall states. Our\nscheme consists in injecting a controlled amount of angular momentum to an\natomic gas using Raman transitions carrying orbital angular momentum. By\ninjecting one unit of angular momentum per atom, one realizes a single-vortex\nstate, which is well described by mean field theory for large enough particle\nnumbers. We also present schemes to realize fractional quantum Hall states,\nnamely the bosonic Laughlin and Moore-Read states. We investigate the\nrequirements for adiabatic nucleation of a such topological states, in\nparticular comparing linear Landau-Zener ramps and arbitrary ramps obtained\nfrom optimized control methods. We also show that this protocol requires\nexcellent control over the isotropic character of the trapping potential.\n", "  Quasi-free photoproduction of $\\pi\\eta$-pairs has been investigated from\nthreshold up to incident photon energies of 1.4 GeV, respectively up to\nphoton-nucleon invariant masses up to 1.9 GeV. Total cross sections, angular\ndistributions, invariant-mass distributions of the $\\pi\\eta$ and meson-nucleon\npairs, and beam-helicity asymmetries have been measured for the reactions\n$\\gamma p\\rightarrow p\\pi^0\\eta$, $\\gamma n\\rightarrow n\\pi^0\\eta$, $\\gamma\np\\rightarrow n\\pi^+\\eta$, and $\\gamma n\\rightarrow p\\pi^-\\eta$ from nucleons\nbound inside the deuteron. For the $\\gamma p$ initial state data for free\nprotons have also been analyzed. Finally, the total cross sections for\nquasi-free production of $\\pi^0\\eta$ pairs from nucleons bound in $^3$He nuclei\nhave been investigated in view of final state interaction (FSI) effects. The\nexperiments were performed at the tagged photon beam facility of the Mainz MAMI\naccelerator using an almost $4\\pi$ covering electromagnetic calorimeter\ncomposed of the Crystal Ball and TAPS detectors. The shapes of all differential\ncross section data and the asymmetries are very similar for protons and\nneutrons and agree with the conjecture that the reactions are dominated by the\nsequential $\\Delta^{\\star}3/2^-\\rightarrow\\eta\\Delta(1232)\\rightarrow\\pi\\eta N$\ndecay chain, mainly with $\\Delta(1700)3/2^-$ and $\\Delta(1940)3/2^-$. The\nratios of the magnitude of the total cross sections also agree with this\nassumption. However, the absolute magnitudes of the cross sections are reduced\nby FSI effects with respect to free proton data.\n", "  High-bunch-charge photoemission electron-sources operating in a continuous\nwave (CW) mode are required for many advanced applications of particle\naccelerators, such as electron coolers for hadron beams, electron-ion\ncolliders, and free-electron lasers (FELs). Superconducting RF (SRF) has\nseveral advantages over other electron-gun technologies in CW mode as it offers\nhigher acceleration rate and potentially can generate higher bunch charges and\naverage beam currents. A 112 MHz SRF electron photoinjector (gun) was developed\nat Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) to produce high-brightness and\nhigh-bunch-charge bunches for the Coherent electron Cooling Proof-of-Principle\n(CeC PoP) experiment. The gun utilizes a quarter-wave resonator (QWR) geometry\nfor assuring beam dynamics, and uses high quantum efficiency (QE) multi-alkali\nphotocathodes for generating electrons.\n", "  It has been hypothesized that the presence of closely orbiting giant planets\nis associated with enhanced chromospheric emission of their host stars. The\nmain cause for such a relation would likely be enhanced dynamo action induced\nby the planet. We present measurements of chromospheric emission in 234 planet\ncandidate systems from the Kepler mission. This ensemble includes 37 systems\nwith giant planet candidates, which show a clear emission enhancement. The\nenhancement, however, disappears when systems which are also identified as\neclipsing binary candidates are removed from the ensemble. This suggests that a\nlarge fraction of the giant planet candidate systems with chromospheric\nemission stronger than the Sun are not giant planet system, but false\npositives. Such false-positive systems could be tidally interacting binaries\nwith strong chromospheric emission. This hypotesis is supported by an analysis\nof 188 eclipsing binary candidates that show increasing chromospheric emission\nas function of decreasing orbital period.\n", "  Images obtained by the Cassini spacecraft of the region just beyond Saturn's\nmain rings reveal a previously unreported narrow and dusty ringlet that has\ndynamical connections with both Saturn's small satellite Prometheus and the F\nring. The radial position of this ringlet is observed to vary with time and\nlongitude, indicating that it is eccentric with an eccentricity of 0.0012 and\nthat its mean orbital radius varies between 139,300 km and 139,400 km. These\nmean radii are consistent with material trapped in a co-orbital 1:1 resonance\nwith Prometheus. However, the apsidal precession rate of this ringlet is not\nthat expected for material close to Prometheus' orbit (2.76 degrees/day).\nInstead, the ringlet appears to be precessing at the same rate as the F ring\n(2.70 degrees/day). This ringlet therefore appears to consist of material\nco-rotating with Prometheus whose apsidal precession rates have been modified\nby interactions with F-ring material. This ringlet may therefore provide new\ninsights into how rings can maintain organized eccentric structures over a\nrange of semi-major axes\n", "  We provide an updated analysis of the forward $J/\\psi$-p scattering\namplitude, relating its imaginary part to $\\gamma p \\to J/\\psi p$ and $\\gamma p\n\\to c \\bar c X$ cross section data, and calculating its real part through a\nonce-subtracted dispersion relation. From a global fit to both differential and\ntotal cross section data, we extract a value for the spin-averaged $J/\\psi$-p\ns-wave scattering length $a_{\\psi p} = 0.046 \\pm 0.005$ fm, which can be\ntranslated into a $J/\\psi$ binding energy in nuclear matter of $B_\\psi = 2.7\n\\pm 0.3$ MeV. We estimate the forward-backward asymmetry to the $\\gamma p \\to\ne^- e^+ p$ process around the $J/\\psi$ resonance, which results from\ninterchanging the leptons in the interference between the $J/\\psi$ production\nand the Bethe-Heitler mechanisms. We show that to good approximation this\nasymmetry depends linearly on $a_{\\psi p}$, and can reach values around -25%\nfor forthcoming $J/\\psi$ threshold production experiments at Jefferson Lab. Its\nmeasurement can thus provide a very sensitive observable for a refined\nextraction of $a_{\\psi p}$.\n", "  Using density-functional perturbation theory and the Gr\\\"uneisen formalism,\nwe directly calculate the linear thermal expansion coefficients (TECs) of a\nhexagonal bulk system MoS$_2$ in the crystallographic $a$ and $c$ directions.\nThe TEC calculation depends critically on the evaluation of a\ntemperature-dependent quantity $I_i(T)$, which is the integral of the product\nof heat capacity and $\\Gamma_i(\\nu)$, of frequency $\\nu$ and strain type $i$,\nwhere $\\Gamma_i(\\nu)$ is the phonon density of states weighted by the\nGr\\\"uneisen parameters. We show that to determine the linear TECs we may use\nminimally two uniaxial strains in the $z$ direction, and either the $x$ or $y$\ndirection. However, a uniaxial strain in either the $x$ or $y$ direction\ndrastically reduces the symmetry of the crystal from a hexagonal one to a\nbase-centered orthorhombic one. We propose to use an efficient and accurate\nsymmetry-preserving biaxial strain in the $xy$ plane to derive the same result\nfor $\\Gamma(\\nu)$. We highlight that the Gr\\\"uneisen parameter associated with\na biaxial strain may not be the same as the average of Gr\\\"uneisen parameters\nassociated with two separate uniaxial strains in the $x$ and $y$ directions due\nto possible preservation of degeneracies of the phonon modes under a biaxial\ndeformation. Large anisotropy of TECs is observed where the linear TEC in the\n$c$ direction is about $1.8$ times larger than that in the $a$ or $b$ direction\nat high temperatures. Our theoretical TEC results are compared with experiment.\nThe symmetry-preserving approach adopted here may be applied to a broad class\nof two lattice-parameter systems such as hexagonal, trigonal, and tetragonal\nsystems, which allows many complicated systems to be treated on a\nfirst-principles level.\n", "  We present a principle and a simple theory of a novel reverse\nelectroactuator, in which the electrical current is generated by pumping of an\nelectrolytic liquid into nonwetting pores of a polarized electrode. The theory\nestablishes the relationship between the variation of external pressure and the\nelectrical current. The effective current density is amplified by high porosity\nof the electrode. The suggested principle can be implemented into a design of a\nshoe which will be generating an AC current simply by walking. Estimates of\ntypical parameters and operation regimes of such device suggest that one can\neasily generate a peak current density of ~17 mA/cm2. This would produce some\n1.7 A from each shoe at 0.65 W average power density, without hampering\nwalking.\n", "  Ultra violet light emitting diodes (UV LEDs) face critical limitations in\nboth the injection efficiency and light extraction efficiency due to the\nresistive and absorbing p-type contact layers. In this work, we investigate the\ndesign and application of polarization engineered tunnel junctions for\nultra-wide bandgap AlGaN (Al mole fraction higher than 50%) materials towards\nhighly efficient UV LEDs. We demonstrate that polarization-induced 3D charge is\nbeneficial in reducing tunneling barriers especially for high composition AlGaN\ntunnel junctions. The design of graded tunnel junction structures could lead to\nlow tunneling resistance below 10-3 Ohm cm2 and low voltage consumption below 1\nV (at 1 kA/cm2) for high composition AlGaN tunnel junctions. Experimental\ndemonstration of 292 nm emission was achieved through non-equilibrium hole\ninjection into wide bandgap materials with bandgap energy larger than 4.7 eV,\nand detailed modeling of tunnel junctions shows that they can be engineered to\nhave low resistance, and can enable efficient emitters in the UV-C wavelength\nrange.\n", "  We report the results from a search in Super-Kamiokande for neutrino signals\ncoincident with the first detected gravitational wave events, GW150914 and\nGW151226, using a neutrino energy range from 3.5 MeV to 100 PeV. We searched\nfor coincident neutrino events within a time window of $\\pm$500 seconds around\nthe gravitational wave detection time. Four neutrino candidates are found for\nGW150914 and no candidates are found for GW151226. The remaining neutrino\ncandidates are consistent with the expected background events. We calculated\nthe 90\\% confidence level upper limits on the combined neutrino fluence for\nboth gravitational wave events, which depends on event energy and topologies.\nConsidering the upward going muon data set (1.6 GeV - 100 PeV) the neutrino\nfluence limit for each gravitational wave event is 14 - 37 (19 - 50) cm$^{-2}$\nfor muon neutrinos (muon antineutrinos), depending on the zenith angle of the\nevent. In the other data sets, the combined fluence limits for both\ngravitational wave events range from 2.4$\\times 10^{4}$ to 7.0$\\times 10^{9}$\ncm$^{-2}$.\n", "  The first eight years of operation of the Cold Neutron Chopper Spectrometer\n(CNCS) at the Spallation Neutron Source in Oak Ridge is being reviewed. The\ninstrument has been part of the facility user program since 2009, and more than\n250 individual user experiments have been performed to date. CNCS is an\nextremely powerful and versatile instrument and offers leading edge performance\nin terms of beam intensity, energy resolution, and flexibility to trade one for\nanother. Experiments are being routinely performed with the sample at extreme\nconditions: T~0.05K, p>=2GPa and B=8T can be achieved individually or in\ncombination. In particular, CNCS is in a position to advance the state of the\nart with inelastic neutron scattering under pressure, and some of the recent\naccomplishments in this area will be presented in more detail.\n", "  We have measured the energies of the strongest 1s-2ell (ell=s,p) transitions\nin He- through Ne-like silicon and sulfur ions to an accuracy of better than\n1eV using Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory's electron beam ion traps,\nEBIT-I and SuperEBIT, and the NASA/GSFC EBIT Calorimeter Spectrometer (ECS). We\nidentify and measure the energies of 18 and 21 X-ray features from silicon and\nsulfur, respectively. The results are compared to new Flexible Atomic Code\ncalculations and to semi-relativistic Hartree Fock calculations by Palmeri et\nal. (2008). These results will be especially useful for wind diagnostics in\nhigh mass X-ray binaries, such as Vela X-1 and Cygnus X-1, where\nhigh-resolution spectral measurements using Chandra's high energy transmission\ngrating has made it possible to measure Doppler shifts of 100km/s. The accuracy\nof our measurements is consistent with that needed to analyze Chandra\nobservations, exceeding Chandra's 100km/s limit. Hence, the results presented\nhere not only provide benchmarks for theory, but also accurate rest energies\nthat can be used to determine the bulk motion of material in astrophysical\nsources. We show the usefulness of our results by applying them to redetermine\nDoppler shifts from Chandra observations of Vela X-1.\n", "  Based on the LAMOST survey and Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), we use\nlow-resolution spectra of 130,043 F/G-type dwarf stars to study the kinematics\nand metallicity properties of the Galactic disk. Our study shows that the stars\nwith poorer metallicity and larger vertical distance from Galactic plane tend\nto have larger eccentricity and velocity dispersion. After separating the\nsample stars into likely thin-disk and thick-disk sub-sample, we find that\nthere exits a negative gradient of rotation velocity $V_{\\phi}$ with\nmetallicity [Fe/H] for the likely thin-disk sub-sample, and the thick-disk\nsub-sample exhibit a larger positive gradient of rotation velocity with\nmetallicity. By comparing with model prediction, we consider the radial\nmigration of stars appears to have influenced on the thin-disk formation. In\naddition, our results shows that the observed thick-disk stellar orbital\neccentricity distribution peaks at low eccentricity ($e \\sim 0.2$) and extends\nto a high eccentricity ($e \\sim 0.8$). We compare this result with four\nthick-disk formation simulated models, and it imply that our result is\nconsistent with gas-rich merger model.\n", "  Modified gravity theories are a popular alternative to dark energy as a\npossible explanation for the observed accelerating cosmic expansion, and their\ncosmological tests are currently an active research field. Studies in recent\nyears have been increasingly focused on testing these theories in the nonlinear\nregime, which is computationally demanding. Here we show that, under certain\ncircumstances, a whole class of theories can be ruled out by using background\ncosmology alone. This is possible because certain classes of models (i) are\nfundamentally incapable of producing specific background expansion histories,\nand (ii) said histories are incompatible with local gravity tests. As an\nexample, we demonstrate that a popular class of models, $f(R)$ gravity, would\nnot be viable if observations suggest even a slight deviation of the background\nexpansion history from that of the $\\Lambda$CDM paradigm.\n", "  We present and evaluate several strategies to search for prompt,\nlow-frequency radio emission associated with gravitational wave transients\nusing the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA). As we are able to repoint the MWA on\ntimescales of tens of seconds, we can search for the dispersed radio signal\nthat has been predicted to originate along with or shortly after a neutron\nstar-neutron star merger. We find that given the large, 600 deg^2 instantaneous\nfield-of-view of the MWA we can cover a significant fraction of the predicted\ngravitational wave error region, although due to the complicated geometry of\nthe latter we only cover >50% of the error region for approximately 5% of\nevents, and roughly 15% of events will be located <10 deg from the MWA pointing\ncenter such that they will be covered in the radio images. For optimal\nconditions our limiting flux density for a 10-s long transient would be 0.1 Jy,\nincreasing to about 1 Jy for a wider range of events. This corresponds to\nluminosity limits of 1e38-1e39 erg/s based on expectations for the distances of\nthe gravitational wave transients, which should be sufficient to detect or\nsignificantly constrain a range of models for prompt emission.\n", "  Motivated by the growing interest on PT-quantum mechanics, in this paper we\ndiscuss some facts on generalized Gibbs states and on their related KMS-like\nconditions. To achieve this, we first consider some useful connections between\nsimilar (Hamiltonian) operators and we propose some extended version of the\nHeisenberg algebraic dynamics, deducing some of their properties, useful for\nour purposes.\n", "  Realistic density dependent CDM3Yn versions of the M3Y interaction have been\nused in an extended Hartree-Fock (HF) calculation of nuclear matter (NM), with\nthe nucleon single-particle potential determined from the total NM energy based\non the Hugenholtz-van Hove theorem that gives rise naturally to a rearrangement\nterm (RT). Using the RT of the single-nucleon potential obtained exactly at\ndifferent NM densities, the density- and energy dependence of the CDM3Yn\ninteractions was modified to account properly for both the RT and observed\nenergy dependence of the nucleon optical potential. Based on a local density\napproximation, the double-folding model of the nucleus-nucleus optical\npotential has been extended to take into account consistently the rearrangement\neffect and energy dependence of the nuclear mean-field potential, using the\nmodified CDM3Yn interactions. The extended double-folding model was applied to\nstudy the elastic $^{12}$C+$^{12}$C and $^{16}$O+$^{12}$C scattering at the\nrefractive energies, where the Airy structure of the nuclear rainbow has been\nwell established. The RT was found to affect significantly the real\nnucleus-nucleus optical potential at small internuclear distances, giving the\npotential strength close to that implied by the realistic optical model\ndescription of the Airy oscillation.\n", "  Actuators at the nanoscale are assuming great important in todays shrinking\nelectronics industry where a system-on-chip approach is used to integrate\nmulti-functional systems and devices. Integration of sensors, actuators,\ninformation processing, and storage have become extremely important, more so at\nthe sub-micrometer scale. Here we utilized vertically aligned carbon nanotube\nforests bonded onto a piezoelectric substrate to provide sensing of nanoscale\nforces and actuation on the same platform. This is a demonstration of\nintegration of two important functions using the functionality of\nnanomaterials. This has immediate utility in many areas including outer space\nexploration, portable consumer electronics, embedded systems, etc.\n", "  Ground-state and magnetocaloric properties of a double-tetrahedral chain, in\nwhich nodal lattice sites occupied by the localized Ising spins regularly\nalternate with triangular clusters half filled with mobile electrons, are\nexactly investigated by using the transfer-matrix method in combination with\nthe construction of the $N$th tensor power of the discrete Fourier\ntransformation. It is shown that the ground state of the model is formed by two\nnon-chiral phases with the zero residual entropy and two chiral phases with the\nfinite residual entropy $S = Nk_{\\rm B}\\ln 2$. Depending on the character of\nthe exchange interaction between the localized Ising spins and mobile\nelectrons, one or three magnetization plateaus can be observed in the\nmagnetization process. Their heights basically depend on the values of Land\\'e\n$g$-factors of the Ising spins and mobile electrons. It is also evidenced that\nthe system exhibits both the conventional and inverse magnetocaloric effect\ndepending on values of the applied magnetic field and temperature.\n", "  We have studied the isothermal magnetization $M(H)$ of\nCeCo(In$_{1-x}$Cd$_x$)$_5$ with $x$ = 0.0075 and 0.01 down to 50 mK. Pronounced\nfield-history dependent phenomena occur in the coexistence regime of the\nsuperconducting and antiferromagnetic phases. At low-fields, a phenomenological\nmodel of magnetic-flux entry well explains $M(H)$ implying the dominance of\nbulk pinning effect. However, unless crystallographic quenched disorder is\nhysteretic, the asymmetric peak effect (ASPE) which appears at higher fields\ncannot be explained by the pinning of vortices due to material defects. Also\nthe temperature dependence of the ASPE deviates from the conventional scenario\nfor the peak effect. Comparison of our thermodynamic phase diagrams with those\nfrom previous neutron scattering and magnetoresistance experiments indicates\nthat the pinning of vortices takes place at the field-history dependent\nantiferromagnetic domain boundaries.\n", "  Schemes based on anticommuting scalar coordinates, corresponding to\nproperties, lead to generations of particles naturally. The application of\nGrassmannian duality cuts down the number of states substantially and is vital\nfor constructing sensible Lagrangians anyhow. We apply duality to all of the\nsubgroups within the {\\em classification} group\nSU(3)$\\times$SU(2)$_L\\times$SU(2)$_R$, which encompasses the standard model\ngauge group, and thereby determine the full state inventory; this includes the\ndefinite prediction of quarks with charge -4/3 and other exotic states.\nAssuming universal gravitational coupling to the gauge fields and parity even\nproperty curvature, we also obtain $4\\sin^2\\theta_w = 1 - 2\\alpha/3\\alpha_s$\nwhich is not far from the experimental value around the $M_Z$ mass.\n", "  Compact stellar objects inspiralling into massive black holes (MBHs) in\ngalactic nuclei are some of the most promising gravitational wave (GWs) sources\nfor next generation GW-detectors. The rates of such extreme mass ratio\ninspirals (EMRIs) depend on the dynamics and distribution of compact objects\naround the MBH. Here we study the impact of mass-segregation processes on EMRI\nrates. In particular, we provide the expected mass function of EMRIs, given an\ninitial mass function of stellar BHs (SBHs), and relate it to the\nmass-dependent detection rate of EMRIs. We then consider the role of star\nformation on the distribution of compact objects and its implication on EMRI\nrates. We find that the existence of a wide spectrum of SBH masses lead to the\noverall increase of EMRI rates, and to high rates of the EMRIs from the\nmost-massive SBHs. However, it also leads to a relative quenching of EMRI rates\nfrom lower-mass SBHs, and together produces a steep dependence of the EMRI mass\nfunction on the highest-mass SBHs. Star-formation history plays a relatively\nsmall role in determining the EMRI rates of SBHs, since most of them migrate\nclose to the MBH through mass-segregation rather than forming in-situ. However,\nthe EMRI rate of neutron stars can be significantly increased when they form\nin-situ close to the MBH, as they can inspiral before relaxation processes\nsignificantly segregates them outwards. A reverse but weaker effect of\ndecreasing the EMRI rates from neutron stars and white dwarfs occurs when\nstar-formation proceeds far from the MBH.\n", "  We demonstrate an optical far-field super-resolution microscopy using array\nof nitrogen vacancy centers in bulk diamond as near-field optical probes. The\nlocal optical field, which transmits through the nanostructures on the diamond\nsurface, is measured by detecting the charge state conversion of nitrogen\nvacancy center. And the locating of nitrogen vacancy center with spatial\nresolution of 6.1 nm is realized with the charge state depletion nanoscopy. The\nnanostructures on the surface of diamond are then imaged with resolution below\noptical diffraction limit. The results offer an approach to built a\ngeneral-purpose optical super-resolution microscopy and a convenient platform\nfor high spatial resolution quantum sensing with nitrogen vacancy center.\n", "  The crystal structure of the double tungstate NaFe(WO$_4$)$_2$ arises from\nthat of the spin-driven multiferroic MnWO$_4$ by inserting non-magnetic Na\nlayers. NaFe(WO$_4$)$_2$ exhibits a three-dimensional incommensurate\nspin-spiral structure at low temperature and zero magnetic field, which,\nhowever, competes with commensurate order induced by magnetic field. The\nincommensurate zero-field phase corresponds to the condensation of a single\nirreducible representation but it does not imply ferroelectric polarization\nbecause spirals with opposite chirality coexist. Sizable anharmonic modulations\nemerge in this incommensurate structure, which are accompanied by large\nmagneto-elastic anomalies, while the onset of the harmonic order is invisible\nin the thermal expansion coefficient. In magnetic fields applied along the\nmonoclinic axis, we observe a first-order transition to a commensurate\nstructure that again is accompanied by large magneto-elastic effects. The large\nmagnetoelastic coupling, a reduction of the $b$ lattice parameter, is thus\nassociated only with the commensurate order. Upon releasing the field at low\ntemperature, the magnetic order transforms to another commensurate structure\nthat considerably differs from the incommensurate low-temperature phase\nemerging upon zero-field cooling. The latter phase, which exhibits a reduced\nordered moment, seems to be metastable.\n", "  In a paper by Umarov, Tsallis and Steinberg (2008), a generalization of the\nFourier transform, called the $q$-Fourier transform, was introduced and applied\nfor the proof of a $q$-generalized central limit theorem ($q$-CLT).\nSubsequently, Hilhorst illustrated (2009 and 2010) that the $q$-Fourier\ntransform for $q>1$ is not invertible in the space of density functions.\nIndeed, using an invariance principle, he constructed a family of densities\nwith the same $q$-Fourier transform and noted that \"as a consequence, the\n$q$-central limit theorem falls short of achieving its stated goal\". The\ndistributions constructed there have compact support. We prove now that the\nlimit distribution in the $q$-CLT is unique and can not have a compact support.\nThis result excludes all the possible counterexamples which can be constructed\nusing the invariance principle and fills the gap mentioned by Hilhorst.\n", "  We determine the equation of state (EOS) of nuclear matter with the inclusion\nof hyperons in a self-consistent manner by using a Modified Quark Meson\nCoupling Model (MQMC) where the confining interaction for quarks inside a\nbaryon is represented by a phenomenological average potential in an equally\nmixed scalar-vector harmonic form. The hadron-hadron interaction in nuclear\nmatter is then realized by introducing additional quark couplings to $\\sigma$,\n$\\omega$, and $\\rho$ mesons through mean-field approximations. The effect of a\nnonlinear $\\omega$-$\\rho$ term on the equation of state is studied. The hyperon\ncouplings are fixed from the optical potential values and the mass-radius curve\nis determined satisfying the maximum mass constraint of $2$~M$_{\\odot}$ for\nneutron stars, as determined in recent measurements of the pulsar PSR\nJ0348+0432. We also observe that there is no significant advantage of\nintroducing the nonlinear $\\omega$-$\\rho$ term in the context of obtaining the\nstar mass constraint in the present set of parametrizations.\n", "  We report a study on axially and reflection symmetric dissipative fluids,\njust after its departure from hydrostatic and thermal equilibrium, at the\nsmallest time scale at which the first signs of dynamic evolution appear. Such\na time scale is smaller than the thermal relaxation time, the thermal\nadjustment time and the hydrostatic time. It is obtained that the onset of\nnon--equilibrium will critically depend on a single function directly related\nto the time derivative of the vorticity. Among all fluid variables (at the time\nscale under consideration), only the tetrad component of the anisotropic tensor\nin the subspace orthogonal to the four--velocity and the Killing vector of\naxial symmetry, shows signs of dynamic evolution. Also, the first step toward a\ndissipative regime begins with a non--vanishing time derivative of the heat\nflux component along the meridional direction. The magnetic part of the Weyl\ntensor vanishes (not so its time derivative), indicating that the emission of\ngravitational radiation will occur at later times. Finally, the decreasing of\nthe effective inertial mass density, associated to thermal effects, is clearly\nillustrated.\n", "  The ability to manipulate plasmons is driving new developments in\nelectronics, optics, sensing, energy, and medicine. Despite the massive\nmomentum of experimental research in this direction, a predictive\nquantum-mechanical framework for describing electron-plasmon interactions in\nreal materials is still missing. Here, starting from a many-body Green's\nfunction approach, we develop an ab initio approach for investigating\nelectron-plasmon coupling in solids. As a first demonstration of this\nmethodology, we show that electron-plasmon scattering is the primary mechanism\nfor the cooling of hot carriers in doped silicon, it is key to explain measured\nelectron mobilities at high doping, and it leads to a quantum zero-point\nrenormalization of the band gap in agreement with experiment.\n", "  Power-law frequency distributions of the peak flux of solar flare X-ray\nemission have been studied extensively and attributed to a system of\nself-organized criticality (SOC). In this paper, we first show that, so long as\nthe shape of the normalized light curve is not correlated with the peak flux,\nthe flux histogram of solar flares also follows a power-law distribution with\nthe same spectral index as the power-law frequency distribution of the peak\nflux, which may partially explain why power-law distributions are ubiquitous in\nthe Universe. We then show that the spectral indexes of the histograms of soft\nX-ray fluxes observed by GOES satellites in two different energy channels are\ndifferent: the higher energy channel has a harder distribution than the lower\nenergy channel, which challenges the universal power-law distribution predicted\nby SOC models and implies a very soft distribution of thermal energy content of\nplasmas probed by the GOES. The temperature ($T$) distribution, on the other\nhand, approaches a power-law distribution with an index of 2 for high values of\n$T$. Application of SOC models to statistical properties of solar flares needs\nto be revisited.\n", "  We study the decoherence and relaxation of a single elementary electronic\nexcitation propagating in a one-dimensional chiral conductor. Using\ntwo-particle interferences in the electronic analog of the Hong-Ou-Mandel\nexperiment, we analyze quantitatively the decoherence scenario of a single\nelectron propagating along a quantum Hall edge channel at filling factor 2. The\ndecoherence results from the emergence of collective neutral excitations\ninduced by Coulomb interaction and leading, in one dimension, to the\ndestruction of the elementary quasiparticle. This study establishes the\nrelevance of electron quantum optics setups to provide stringent tests of\nstrong interaction effects in one-dimensional conductors described by Luttinger\nliquids paradigm.\n", "  The EUSO (Extreme Universe Space Observatory) project is developing a new\nmission concept for the scientific research of Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays\n(UHECRs) from space. The EUSO wide-field telescope will look down from space\nonto the Earth night sky to detect UV photons emitted from air showers\ngenerated by UHECRs in our atmosphere. In this article we concentrate on the\nmitigation strategies agreed so far, and in particular on the implementation of\na careful early selection and testing of subsystem materials (including\noptics), design and interfaces of the subsystem and an optimization of the\ninstrument operational concept.\n", "  The properties of non-product states, both (anti)symmetrized and entangled,\nhave been extensively studied in the literature. In this paper, by extending\nprevious partial results, we introduce a general framework to describe atomic\nabsorption and emission in these states. Our approach shows the existence of\nsome fundamental differences between entanglement and (anti)symmetrization and\nbetween absorption and emission. For instance, modifications of the emission\nproperties with respect to that of uncorrelated systems occur for any\n(anti)symmetrized state but only for some very specific entangled states.\n", "  Although InP and GaAs have very similar band-structure their magnetic\nproperties appear to drastically differ. Critical temperatures in (In,Mn)P are\nmuch smaller than that of (Ga,Mn)As and scale linearly with Mn concentration.\nThis is in contrast to the square root behaviour found in (Ga,Mn)As. Moreover\nthe magnetization curve exhibits an unconventional shape in (In,Mn)P\ncontrasting with the conventional one of well annealed (Ga,Mn)As. By combining\nseveral theoretical approaches, the nature of ferromagnetism in Mn doped InP is\ninvestigated. It appears that the magnetic properties are essentially\ncontrolled by the position of the Mn acceptor level. Our calculations are in\nexcellent agreement with recent measurements for both critical temperatures and\nmagnetizations. The results are only consistent with a Fermi level lying in an\nimpurity band, ruling out the possibility to understand the physical properties\nof Mn doped InP within the valence band scenario. The quantitative success\nfound here reveals a predictive tool of choice that should open interesting\npathways to address magnetic properties in other compounds\n", "  We present an intensive monitoring of high-resolution spectra of the Ca {\\sc\nii} K line in the A7IV shell star $\\Phi$ Leo at very short (minutes, hours),\nshort (night to night), and medium (weeks, months) timescales. The spectra show\nremarkable variable absorptions on timescales of hours, days, and months. The\ncharacteristics of these sporadic events are very similar to most that are\nobserved toward the debris disk host star $\\beta$ Pic, which are commonly\ninterpreted as signs of the evaporation of solid, comet-like bodies grazing or\nfalling onto the star. Therefore, our results suggest the presence of solid\nbodies around $\\Phi$ Leo. To our knowledge, with the exception of $\\beta$ Pic,\nour monitoring has the best time resolution at the mentioned timescales for a\nstar with events attributed to exocomets. Assuming the cometary scenario and\nconsidering the timescales of our monitoring, our results indicate that $\\Phi$\nLeo presents the richest environment with comet-like events known to date,\nsecond only to $\\beta$ Pic.\n", "  Euclid is the second medium-size mission (M2) of the ESA Cosmic Vision\nProgram, currently scheduled for a launch in 2020. The two instruments on-board\nEuclid, VIS and NISP, will provide key measurements to investigate the nature\nof dark energy, advancing our knowledge on cosmology. We present in this\ncontribution the development and manufacturing status of the VIS Read-out\nShutter Unit, whose main function is to prevent direct light from falling onto\nthe VIS CCDs during the read-out of the scientific exposures and to allow the\ndark-current/bias calibrations of the instrument.\n", "  We apply the complex de Broglie-Bohm formulation of quantum mechanics [1] to\na spatially closed homogeneous and isotropic early Universe whose matter\ncontent are radiation and dust perfect fluids. We then show that an expanding\nclassical Universe can emerge from an oscillating (with complex scale factor)\nquantum Universe without singularity. Furthermore, the Universe obtained in\nthis process has no horizon or flatness problems.\n", "  The thermodynamic and magnetocaloric properties of a generalized\nspin-$(1/2,s)$ Fisher's super-exchange antiferromagnet are exactly investigated\nby using the decoration-iteration mapping transformation. Besides the critical\ntemperature, sublattice magnetization, total magnetization, entropy and\nspecific heat, the isothermal entropy change and adiabatic temperature change\nare rigorously calculated in order to examine cooling efficiency of the model\nin a vicinity of the first- and second-order phase transitions. It is shown\nthat an enhanced inverse magnetocaloric effect occurs around the temperature\ninterval $T_c(B\\neq 0) \\lesssim T < T_c(B = 0)$ for any magnetic-field change\n$\\Delta B: 0 \\to B$. The most pronounced inverse magnetocaloric effect can be\nfound nearby the critical field, which corresponds to the zero-temperature\nphase transition from the long-range ordered ground state to the paramagnetic\none. The observed phenomenon increases with the increasing value of decorating\nspins. Furthermore, sufficiently high values of decorating spins have also\nlinked to a possibility of observing reentrant phase transitions at finite\ntemperatures.\n", "  The detection of complex organic molecules (COMs) toward cold sources such as\npre-stellar cores (with T<10 K), has challenged our understanding of the\nformation processes of COMs in the interstellar medium. Recent modelling on COM\nchemistry at low temperatures has provided new insight into these processes\npredicting that COM formation depends strongly on parameters such as visual\nextinction and the level of CO freeze out. We report deep observations of COMs\ntoward two positions in the L1544 pre-stellar core: the dense,\nhighly-extinguished continuum peak with Av>=30 mag within the inner 2700 au;\nand a low-density shell with average Av~7.5-8 mag located at 4000 au from the\ncore's center and bright in CH3OH. Our observations show that CH3O, CH3OCH3 and\nCH3CHO are more abundant (by factors ~2-10) toward the low-density shell than\ntoward the continuum peak. Other COMs such as CH3OCHO, c-C3H2O, HCCCHO, CH2CHCN\nand HCCNC show slight enhancements (by factors <=3) but the associated\nuncertainties are large. This suggests that COMs are actively formed and\nalready present in the low-density shells of pre-stellar cores. The modelling\nof the chemistry of O-bearing COMs in L1544 indicates that these species are\nenhanced in this shell because i) CO starts freezing out onto dust grains\ndriving an active surface chemistry; ii) the visual extinction is sufficiently\nhigh to prevent the UV photo-dissociation of COMs by the external interstellar\nradiation field; and iii) the density is still moderate to prevent severe\ndepletion of COMs onto grains.\n", "  Full orbit dynamics of charged particles in a $3$-dimensional helical\nmagnetic field in the presence of $\\alpha$-stable L\\'evy electrostatic\nfluctuations and linear friction modeling collisional Coulomb drag is studied\nvia Monte Carlo numerical simulations. The L\\'evy fluctuations are introduced\nto model the effect of non-local transport due to fractional diffusion in\nvelocity space resulting from intermittent electrostatic turbulence. The\nprobability distribution functions of energy, particle displacements, and\nLarmor radii are computed and showed to exhibit a transition from exponential\ndecay, in the case of Gaussian fluctuations, to power law decay in the case of\nL\\'evy fluctuations. The absolute value of the power law decay exponents are\nlinearly proportional to the L\\'evy index $\\alpha$. The observed anomalous\nnon-Gaussian statistics of the particles' Larmor radii (resulting from outlier\ntransport events) indicate that, when electrostatic turbulent fluctuations\nexhibit non-Gaussian L\\'evy statistics, gyro-averaging and guiding centre\napproximations might face limitations and full particle orbit effects should be\ntaken into account.\n", "  The self-consistent GW{\\Gamma} method satisfies the Ward-Takahashi identity\n(i.e., the gauge invariance or the local charge continuity) for arbitrary\nenergy ($\\omega$) and momentum ($\\bf q$) transfers. Its self-consistent\nfirst-principles treatment of the vertex $\\Gamma=\\Gamma_v$ or $\\Gamma_W$ is\npossible to first order in the bare ($v$) or dynamically-screened ($W$) Coulomb\ninteraction. It is developed within a linearized scheme and combined with the\nBethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) to accurately calculate photoabsorption spectra\n(PAS) and photoemission (or inverse photoemission) spectra (PES)\nsimultaneously. The method greatly improves the PAS of Na, Na$_3$, B$_2$, and\nC$_2$H$_2$ calculated using the standard one-shot $G_0W_0$ + BSE method that\nresults in significantly redshifted PAS by 0.8-3.1 eV, although the PES are\nwell reproduced already in $G_0W_0$.\n", "  We fit the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of members of a large sample\nof Fermi 2LAC blazars to synchrotron and inverse Compton (IC) models. Our main\nresults are as follows. (i) As suggested by previous works, the correlation\nbetween peak frequency and curvature can be explained by statistical or\nstochastic particle acceleration mechanisms. For BL Lacs, we find a linear\ncorrelation between synchrotron peak frequency and its curvature. The slope of\nthe correlation is consistent with the stochastic acceleration mechanisms and\nconfirm previous studies. For FSRQs, we also find a linear correlation, but its\nslope cannot be explained by previous theoretical models. (ii) We find a\nsignificant correlation between IC luminosity and synchrotron luminosity. The\nslope of the correlation of FSRQs is consistent with the EC process. And the\nslope of the correlation of BL Lac is consistent with the SSC process. (iii) We\nfind several significant correlations between IC curvature and several basic\nparameters of blazars (black hole mass, broad line luminosity, the Lorentz\nfactor of jet). We also find significant correlations between bolometric\nluminosity and these basic parameters of blazars which suggest that the origin\nof jet is a mixture of the mechanisms proposed by Blandford $\\&$ Znajek and by\nBlandford $\\&$ Payne.\n", "  We study how well we can retrodict results of measurements made on a quantum\nsystem if we can make measurements on its final state. We know what\nmeasurements were made, but not their results. An initial examination shows\nthat we can gain anywhere from no information to perfect information about the\nresults of previous measurements, depending on the measurements and the initial\nstate of the system. The case of two two-outcome measurements, the second of\nwhich is a projective measurement, is examined in some detail. We then look at\na model of a qubit interferometer in which measurements are made in order to\ndetermine the path the qubit followed. The measurement made on the final state\nof the qubit depends on the information about previous measurement results that\nwe are trying to determine. One can attempt to find the result of just one of\nthe measurements, all of them, or find a measurement sequence that was not\nrealized. We study all three possibilities.\n", "  A detailed search for emission and absorption lines and assessing their upper\nlimits are performed for Suzaku data. The method utilizes a matched-filtering\napproach to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio for a given energy resolution,\nwhich could be applicable to many types of line search. We first applied it to\nwell-known AGN spectra that have been reported to have ultra-fast outflows, and\nfind that our results are consistent with previous findings at the ~3{\\sigma}\nlevel. We proceeded to search for emission and absorption features in the two\nbright magnetars 4U 0142+61 and 1RXS J1708-4009, applying the filtering method\nto Suzaku data. We found that neither source showed any significant indication\nof line features, even using long Suzaku observations and dividing their\nspectra into spin phases. The upper limits on the equivalent width of\nemission/absorption lines are constrained to be a few eV at ~1 keV, and a few\nhundreds of eV at ~10 keV. This strengthens previous reports that persistently\nbright magnetars do not show proton cyclotron absorption features in soft\nX-rays and, even if they exist, they would be broadened or much weaker than\nbelow the detection limit of X-ray CCD.\n", "  Tailoring the thermal conductivity of polymers is central to enlarge their\napplications in the thermal management of flexible integrated circuits.\nProgress has been made over the past decade by fabricating materials with\nvarious nanostructures, but a clear relationship between various functional\ngroups and thermal properties of polymers remains to be established. Here, we\nnumerically study the thermal conductivity of single-stranded carbon-chain\npolymers with multiple substituents of hydrogen atoms through atomic mass\nmodification. We find that their thermal conductivity can be tuned by atomic\nmass modifications as revealed through molecular dynamics simulations. The\nsimulation results suggest that heavy homogeneous substituents do not assist\nheat transport and trace amounts of heavy substituents can in fact hinder heat\ntransport substantially. Our analysis indicates that carbon chain has the\nbiggest contribution (over 80%) to the thermal conduction in single-stranded\ncarbon-chain polymers. We further demonstrate that atomic mass modifications\ninfluence the phonon bands of bonding carbon atoms, and the discrepancies of\nphonon bands between carbon atoms are responsible for the remarkable drops in\nthermal conductivity and large thermal resistances in carbon chains. Our study\nprovides fundamental insight into how to tailor the thermal conductivity of\npolymers through variable substituents.\n", "  We study the phase space for an scalar-tensor string inspired model of dark\nenergy with non minimal kinetic and Gauss Bonnet couplings. The form of the\nscalar potential and of the coupling terms is of the exponential type, which\ngive rise to appealing cosmological solutions. The critical points describe a\nvariety of cosmological scenarios that go from matter or radiation dominated\nuniverse to dark energy dominated universe. There were found trajectories in\nthe phase space departing from unstable or saddle fixed points and arriving to\nthe stable scalar field dominated point corresponding to late-time accelerated\nexpansion.\n", "  Hot channel (HC) structure, observed in the high-temperature passbands of the\nAIA/SDO, is regarded as one candidate of coronal flux rope which is an\nessential element of solar eruptions. Here we present the first radio imaging\nstudy of an HC structure in the metric wavelength. The associated radio\nemission manifests as a moving type-IV (t-IVm) burst. We show that the radio\nsources co-move outwards with the HC, indicating that the t-IV emitting\nenergetic electrons are efficiently trapped within the structure. The t-IV\nsources at different frequencies present no considerable spatial dispersion\nduring the early stage of the event, while the sources spread gradually along\nthe eruptive HC structure at later stage with significant spatial dispersion.\nThe t-IV bursts are characterized by a relatively-high brightness temperature\n($\\sim$ 10$^{7}$ $-$ 10$^{9}$ K), a moderate polarization, and a spectral shape\nthat evolves considerably with time. This study demonstrates the possibility of\nimaging the eruptive HC structure at the metric wavelength and provides strong\nconstraints on the t-IV emision mechanism, which, if understood, can be used to\ndiagnose the essential parameters of the eruptive structure.\n", "  Cosmological simulations of galaxy formation can produce present-day galaxies\nwith a large range of assembly and star formation histories. A detailed study\nof the metallicity evolution and star formation history of such simulations can\nassist in predicting LIGO-detectable compact object binary mergers. Recent\nsimulations of compact binary evolution suggest the compact object merger rate\ndepends sensitively on the progenitor's metallicity. Rare low-metallicity star\nformation during galaxy assembly can produce more detected compact binaries\nthan typical star formation. Using detailed simulations of galaxy and chemical\nevolution, we determine how sensitively the compact binary populations of\ngalaxies with similar present-day appearance depend on the details of their\nassembly. We also demonstrate by concrete example the extent to which dwarf\ngalaxies overabundantly produce compact binary mergers, particularly binary\nblack holes, relative to more massive galaxies. We discuss the implications for\ntransient multimessenger astronomy with compact binary sources.\n", "  We present a study on galaxy detection and shape classification using\ntopometric clustering algorithms. We first use the DBSCAN algorithm to extract,\nfrom CCD frames, groups of adjacent pixels with significant fluxes and we then\napply the DENCLUE algorithm to separate the contributions of overlapping\nsources. The DENCLUE separation is based on the localization of pattern of\nlocal maxima, through an iterative algorithm which associates each pixel to the\nclosest local maximum. Our main classification goal is to take apart elliptical\nfrom spiral galaxies. We introduce new sets of features derived from the\ncomputation of geometrical invariant moments of the pixel group shape and from\nthe statistics of the spatial distribution of the DENCLUE local maxima\npatterns. Ellipticals are characterized by a single group of local maxima,\nrelated to the galaxy core, while spiral galaxies have additional ones related\nto segments of spiral arms. We use two different supervised ensemble\nclassification algorithms, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting. Using a sample\nof ~ 24000 galaxies taken from the Galaxy Zoo 2 main sample with spectroscopic\nredshifts, and we test our classification against the Galaxy Zoo 2 catalog. We\nfind that features extracted from our pipeline give on average an accuracy of ~\n93%, when testing on a test set with a size of 20% of our full data set, with\nfeatures deriving from the angular distribution of density attractor ranking at\nthe top of the discrimination power.\n", "  Magnetic null has long been recognized as a special structure serving as a\npreferential site for magnetic reconnection (MR). However, the direct\nobservational study of MR at null-points is largely lacking. Here, we show the\nobservations of MR around a magnetic null associated with an eruption that\nresulted in an M1.7 flare and a coronal mass ejection. The GOES X- ray profile\nof the flare exhibited two peaks at 02:23 UT and 02:40 UT on 2012 November 8,\nrespectively. Based on the imaging observations, we find that the first and\nalso primary X- ray peak was originated from MR in the current sheet underneath\nthe erupting magnetic flux rope (MFR). On the other hand, the second and also\nweaker X-ray peak was caused by MR around a null-point located above the\npre-eruption MFR. The interaction of the null-point and the erupting MFR can be\ndescribed as a two-step process. During the first step, the erupting and fast\nexpanding MFR passed through the null-point, resulting in a significant\ndisplacement of the magnetic field surrounding the null. During the second\nstep, the displaced magnetic field started to move back, resulting in a\nconverging inflow and subsequently the MR around the null. The null-point\nreconnection is a different process from the current sheet reconnection in this\nflare; the latter is the cause of the main peak of the flare, while the former\nis the cause of the secondary peak of the flare and the conspicuous high-lying\ncusp structure.\n", "  I begin with some memories of Abdus Salam who was my PhD supervisor. After\nreviewing the theory of non-linear realisations and Kac-Moody algebras, I\nexplain how to construct the non-linear realisation based on the Kac-Moody\nalgebra E11 and its vector representation. I explain how this field theory\nleads to dynamical equations which contain an infinite number of fields defined\non a space time with an infinite number of coordinates. I then show that these\nunique dynamical equations, when truncated to low level fields and the usual\ncoordinates of space time, lead to precisely the equations of motion of eleven\ndimensional supergravity theory. By taking different group decompositions of\nE11 we find all the maximal supergravity theories, including the gauged maximal\nsupergravities, and as a result the non-linear realisation should be thought of\nas a unified theory that is the low energy effective action for type II strings\nand branes. These results essentially confirm the E11 conjecture given many\nyears ago.\n", "  A realization of Majorana fermions is proposed in the frustrated magnets via\nthe topological proximity effect. Specifically, we consider a theoretical\nmodel, where a topological insulator is coupled to a frustrated magnetic\nmaterial through the spin exchange interaction. Using the renormalization\ngroup-based self-consistent mean-field approach, and calculating the\nself-energy correction due to the topological insulator, we find that the spin\ntexture and the spin-momentum locking of the Dirac cone will be inherited by\nthe spinons in the nearby frustrated magnets. This leads to a particular\ntopological state of matter that supports the Majorana excitations. Unlike the\nconventional realization in SC systems, these Majorana fermions are the\ncombination of spinons and anti-spinons, rather than electrons and holes. They\ncan participate in the transport of spinons, leading to nontrivial properties\nof the spin transport.\n", "  The four-body contribution of the model-independent radiative corrections to\nthe Dalitz plot of the semileptonic decays of neutral kaons are computed to\norder (\\alpha/\\pi)(q/M_1), where q is the momentum transfer and M_1 is the kaon\nmass. The final result is presented in two forms. The first one is given in\nterms of the triple integration of the bremsstrahlung photon ready to be\nperformed numerically; the second one is a fully analytical expression. This\npaper is organized to make it accessible and reliable in the analysis of the\nDalitz plot of precision experiments involving kaons and is not compromised to\nfixing the form factors at predetermined values. As a byproduct, gathering\ntogether three- and four-body contributions of radiative corrections yields,\nthrough a least-squares fit to the measured kaon decay rates, the value\nf_+^{K^0\\pi^-}|V_{us}| = 0.2168(3).\n", "  We report on the custom produced low radiation background stainless steel and\nthe welding rod for the PandaX experiment, one of the deep underground\nexperiments to search for dark matter and neutrinoless double beta decay using\nxenon. The anthropogenic 60 Co concentration in these samples is at the range\nof 1 mBq/kg or lower. We also discuss the radioactivity of nuclear-grade\nstainless steel from TISCO which has a similar background rate. The PandaX-II\npressure vessel was thus fabricated using the stainless steel from CISRI and\nTISCO. Based on the analysis of the radioactivity data, we also made\ndiscussions on potential candidate for low background metal materials for\nfuture pressure vessel development.\n", "  We present HI observations of four giant low surface brightness (GLSB)\ngalaxies UGC 1378, UGC 1922, UGC 4422 and UM 163 using the Giant Meterwave\nRadio Telescope (GMRT). We include HI results on UGC 2936, UGC 6614 and Malin 2\nfrom literature. HI is detected from all the galaxies and the extent is roughly\ntwice the optical size; in UM 163, HI is detected along a broken disk\nencircling the optical galaxy. We combine our results with those in literature\nto further understand these systems. The main results are the following: (1)\nThe peak HI surface densities in GLSB galaxies are several times 10^21 cm^{-2}\n. The HI mass is between 0.3 - 4 x 10^10 M_Sun/yr, dynamical mass ranges from a\nfew times 10^11 M_Sun/yr to a few times 10^12 M_Sun/yr. (2) The rotation curves\nof GLSB galaxies are flat to the outermost measured point with rotation\nvelocities of the seven GLSB galaxies being between 225 and 432 km s^{-1}. (3)\nRecent star formation traced by near-ultraviolet emission in five GLSB galaxies\nin our sample appears to be located in rings around the galaxy centre. We\nsuggest that this could be due to a stochastic burst of star formation at one\nlocation in the galaxy being propagated along a ring over a rotation period.\n(4) The Hi is correlated with recent star formation in five of the seven GLSB\ngalaxies.\n", "  We provide a graphical description of the entanglement of pure-state\nmultiparty systems based on an analogy between a bipartite purity analysis and\nthe centroid of a collection of point masses. This description applies to\nquantum systems with $N$ parties, each with an arbitrary number of (discrete)\nstates. The case of $N$ qubits is highlighted for simplicity. This geometric\ndescription illustrates some of the restrictions in the form of inequalities\nthat apply to entanglement in multiparty systems.\n", "  The Strong equivalence Principle (SEP) states that the description of a\nphysical system in a gravitational field is indistinguishable from the\ndescription of the same system at rest in an accelerating frame. While this\nstatement holds true in both General Relativity and ordinary Quantum Mechanics,\none expects it to fail when quantum gravity corrections are taken into account.\nIn this paper we investigate the possible failure of the SEP in two Quantum\nGravity inspired modifications of Quantum Mechanics - Polymer Quantum Mechanics\nand deformed Heisenberg Algebra. We find that the SEP fails to hold in both\nthese theories. We estimate the deviation from SEP and find in both cases that\nit is too small to be measured in present day experiments.\n", "  Recently, the first lithium detection outside of the Milky Way was made in\nlow-metallicity gas of the Small Magellanic Cloud, which was at the level of\nthe expected primordial value. Part of the observed lithium in any environment\nhas primordial origin, but there is always some post-BBN (Big Bang\nNucleosynthesis) contamination, since lithium can also be produced in\ncosmic-ray interactions with the interstellar medium. Using the fact that\nprocesses involving cosmic rays produce lithium, but also gamma rays through\nneutral pion decay, we use the Small Magellanic Cloud gamma-ray observations by\nFermi-LAT to make predictions on the amount of lithium in this galaxy that was\nproduced by galactic cosmic rays accelerated in supernova remnants. By\nincluding both fusion processes, as well as spallation of heavier nuclei, we\nfind that galactic cosmic rays could produce a very small amount of lithium. In\nthe case of 6Li isotope (which should only be produced by cosmic rays) we can\nonly explain 0.16% of the measured abundance. If these cosmic rays are indeed\nresponsible for such small lithium production, observed abundances could be the\nresult of some other sources, which are discussed in the paper.\n", "  The twin paradox of the special theory of relativity has given rise to a\nlarge body of literature discussing its implications. In its standard form, the\ntraveler changes velocity only at the destination of the trip, so that he\nappears to perceive an improbably instantaneous and non-continuous change in\nage of the stationary twin. In this work, a smooth velocity/acceleration\nprofile is used that allows the abrupt velocity-change case as a limit. All\ngravitational effects are ignored in this treatment. Aside from mutual\nperception of simultaneous clock times in an accelerating frame, constant\ncommunication of clock times between the twins by means of (digital) light\nsignals is shown to be possible, in principle if not in practice.\n", "  We present a detailed study of nuclear corrections in the deuteron (D) from\nan analysis of data from charged-lepton deep-inelastic scattering (DIS) off\nproton and D, as well as from dimuon pair production in pp and pD collisions\nand $W^\\pm$ and the $Z$ boson production at pp (p$\\rm \\bar p$) colliders. In\nparticular, we discuss the determination of the off-shell function describing\nthe modification of parton distributions (PDF) in bound nucleons in the context\nof global PDF fits. Our results are consistent with the ones obtained earlier\nfrom the study of the ratios of DIS structure functions $F_2^A/F_2^D$ in nuclei\nwith $A\\geq4$, confirming the universality of the off-shell function. We also\ndiscuss the sensitivity to various models of the deuteron wave function and the\nimpact of nuclear corrections on the determination of the $d$ quark\ndistribution.\n", "  We study, by means of numerical simulations and analysis, the details of the\naccretion process from a disc onto a binary system. We show that energy is\ndissipated at the edge of a circumbinary disc and this is associated with the\ntidal torque that maintains the cavity: angular momentum is transferred from\nthe binary to the disc through the action of compressional shocks and viscous\nfriction. These shocks can be viewed as being produced by fluid elements which\ndrift into the cavity and, before being accreted, are accelerated onto\ntrajectories that send them back to impact the disc. The rate of energy\ndissipation is approximately equal to the product of potential energy per unit\nmass at the disc's inner edge and the accretion rate, estimated from the disc\nparameters just beyond the cavity edge, that would occur without the binary.\nFor very thin discs, the actual accretion rate onto the binary may be\nsignificantly less. We calculate the energy emitted by a circumbinary disc\ntaking into account energy dissipation at the inner edge and also irradiation\narising there from reprocessing of light from the stars. We find that, for\ntight PMS binaries, the SED is dominated by emission from the inner edge at\nwavelengths between 1-4 and 10 $\\mu$m. This may apply to systems like CoRoT\n223992193 and V1481 Ori.\n", "  In this manuscript, we study properties of long-term optical variability of a\nlarge sample of 106 SDSS spectroscopically confirmed AGN with double-peaked\nbroad low-ionization emission lines (double-peaked emitters). The long-term\noptical light curves over 8 years are collected from the Catalina Sky Surveys\nData Release 2. And, the Damped Random Walk (DRW) process is applied to\ndescribe the long-term variability of the double-peaked emitters. Meanwhile,\nthe same DRW process is applied to long-term optical light curves of more than\n7000 spectroscopically confirmed normal quasars in the SDSS Stripe82 Database.\nThen, we can find that the DRW process determined rest-frame intrinsic\nvariability timescales $\\ln(\\tau/{\\rm days})$ are about 5.8 and about 4.8 for\nthe double-peaked emitters and for the normal quasars, respectively. The\nstatistically longer intrinsic variability timescales can be confirmed in the\ndouble-peaked emitters, after considerations of necessary effects, such as the\neffects from different distributions of redshift, BH mass and accretion rate\nbetween the double-peaked emitters and the normal quasars. Moreover, a radial\ndependence of accretion rate $\\dot{m}_{\\rm R}~\\propto~R^\\beta$ with larger\nvalues of $\\beta$ could be an acceptable interpretation of the longer intrinsic\nvariability timescales in the double-peaked emitters. Therefore, there are\ndifferent intrinsic properties of emission regions between the double-peaked\nemitters and the normal quasars. The double-peaked emitters can be well treated\nas an unique subclass of AGN.\n", "  We present the first VLBI detection of HCN molecular absorption in the nearby\nactive galactic nucleus NGC 1052. Utilizing the 1 milliarcsecond resolution\nachieved by the Korean VLBI Network, we have spatially resolved the HCN\nabsorption against a double-sided nuclear jet structure. Two velocity features\nof HCN absorption are detected significantly at the radial velocity of 1656 and\n1719 km/s, redshifted by 149 and 212 km/s with respect to the systemic velocity\nof the galaxy. The column density of the HCN molecule is estimated to be\n10^{15}-10^{16} cm^{-2}, assuming the excitation temperature of 100-230 K. The\nabsorption features show high optical depth localized on the receding jet side,\nwhere the free-free absorption occurred due to the circumnuclear torus. The\nsize of the foreground absorbing molecular gas is estimated to be on\napproximately one-parsec scales, which agrees well with the approximate size of\nthe circumnuclear torus. HCN absorbing gas is likely to be several clumps\nsmaller than 0.1 parsec inside the circumnuclear torus. The redshifted\nvelocities of the HCN absorption features imply that HCN absorbing gas traces\nongoing infall motion inside the circumnuclear torus onto the central engine.\n", "  Various lines of evidence suggest that the cores of a large portion of\nearly-type galaxies (ETGs) are virtually evacuated of warm ionised gas. This\nimplies that the Lyman-continuum (LyC) radiation produced by an assumed active\ngalactic nucleus (AGN) can escape from the nuclei of these systems without\nbeing locally reprocessed into nebular emission, which would prevent their\nreliable spectroscopic classification as Seyfert galaxies with standard\ndiagnostic emission-line ratios. The spectral energy distribution (SED) of\nthese ETGs would then lack nebular emission and be essentially composed of an\nold stellar component and the featureless power-law (PL) continuum from the\nAGN. A question that arises in this context is whether the AGN component can be\ndetected with current spectral population synthesis in the optical,\nspecifically, whether these techniques effectively place an AGN detection\nthreshold in LyC-leaking galaxies. To quantitatively address this question, we\ntook a combined approach that involves spectral fitting with STARLIGHT of\nsynthetic SEDs composed of stellar emission that characterises a 10 Gyr old ETG\nand an AGN power-law component that contributes a fraction $0\\leq\nx_{\\mathrm{AGN}} < 1$ of the monochromatic luminosity at $\\lambda_0=$ 4020 \\AA.\nIn addition to a set of fits for PL distributions $F_{\\nu} \\propto\n\\nu^{-\\alpha}$ with the canonical $\\alpha=1.5$, we used a base of multiple PLs\nwith $0.5 \\leq \\alpha \\leq 2$ for a grid of synthetic SEDs with a\nsignal-to-noise ratio of 5-$10^3$. Our analysis indicates an effective AGN\ndetection threshold at $x_{\\mathrm{AGN}}\\simeq 0.26$, which suggests that a\nconsiderable fraction of ETGs hosting significant accretion-powered nuclear\nactivity may be missing in the AGN demographics.\n", "  We have determined the masses and mass-to-light ratios of 50 Galactic\nglobular clusters by comparing their velocity dispersion and surface brightness\nprofiles against a large grid of 900 N-body simulations of star clusters of\nvarying initial concentration, size and central black hole mass fraction. Our\nmodels follow the evolution of the clusters under the combined effects of\nstellar evolution and two-body relaxation allowing us to take the effects of\nmass segregation and energy equipartition between stars self-consistently into\naccount. For a subset of 16 well observed clusters we also derive their\nkinematic distances. We find an average mass-to-light ratio of Galactic\nglobular clusters of $<M/L_V>=1.98 \\pm 0.03$, which agrees very well with the\nexpected M/L ratio if the initial mass function of the clusters was a standard\nKroupa or Chabrier mass function. We do not find evidence for a decrease of the\naverage mass-to-light ratio with metallicity. The surface brightness and\nvelocity dispersion profiles of most globular clusters are incompatible with\nthe presence of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) with more than a few\nthousand $M_\\odot$ in them. The only clear exception is $\\omega$ Cen, where the\nvelocity dispersion profile provides strong evidence for the presence of a\n$\\sim$40,000 $M_\\odot$ IMBH in the centre of the cluster.\n", "  Photometric data from the Xuyi Schmidt Telescope Photometric Survey of the\nGalactic Anticentre (XSTPS-GAC) and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) are\nused to derive the global structure parameters of the smooth components of the\nMilky Way. The data, which cover nearly 11,000 deg$^2$ sky area and the full\nrange of Galactic latitude, allow us to construct a globally representative\nGalactic model. The number density distribution of Galactic halo stars is\nfitted with an oblate spheroid that decays by power law. The best-fit yields an\naxis ratio and a power law index $\\kappa=0.65$ and $p=2.79$, respectively. The\n$r$-band differential star counts of three dwarf samples are then fitted with a\nGalactic model. The best-fit model yielded by a Markov Chain Monte Carlo\nanalysis has thin and thick disk scale heights and lengths of $H_{1}=$ 322\\,pc\nand $L_{1}=$2343\\,pc, $H_{2}=$794\\,pc and $L_{2}=$3638\\,pc, a local\nthick-to-thin disk density ratio of $f_2=$11\\,per\\,cent, and a local density\nratio of the oblate halo to the thin disk of $f_h=$0.16\\,per\\,cent. The\nmeasured star count distribution, which is in good agreement with the above\nmodel for most of the sky area, shows a number of statistically significant\nlarge scale overdensities, including some of the previously known\nsubstructures, such as the Virgo overdensity and the so-called \"north near\nstructure\", and a new feature between 150\\degr $< l < $ 240\\degr~and $-1$5\\degr\n$< b < $ $-$5\\degr, at an estimated distance between 1.0 and 1.5\\,kpc. The\nGalactic North-South asymmetry in the anticentre is even stronger than\npreviously thought.\n", "  We make use of $N$-body simulations to determine the relationship between two\nobservable parameters that are used to quantify mass segregation and energy\nequipartition in star clusters. Mass segregation can be quantified by measuring\nhow the slope of a cluster's stellar mass function $\\alpha$ changes with\nclustercentric distance r, and then calculating $\\delta_\\alpha = \\frac{d\n\\alpha(r)}{d ln(r/r_m)}$ where $r_m$ is the cluster's half-mass radius. The\ndegree of energy equipartition in a cluster is quantified by $\\eta$, which is a\nmeasure of how stellar velocity dispersion $\\sigma$ depends on stellar mass m\nvia $\\sigma(m) \\propto m^{-\\eta}$. Through a suite of $N$-body star cluster\nsimulations with a range of initial sizes, binary fractions, orbits, black hole\nretention fractions, and initial mass functions, we present the co-evolution of\n$\\delta_\\alpha$ and $\\eta$. We find that measurements of the global $\\eta$ are\nstrongly affected by the radial dependence of $\\sigma$ and mean stellar mass\nand the relationship between $\\eta$ and $\\delta_\\alpha$ depends mainly on the\ncluster's initial conditions and the tidal field. Within $r_m$, where these\neffects are minimized, we find that $\\eta$ and $\\delta_\\alpha$ initially share\na linear relationship. However, once the degree of mass segregation increases\nsuch that the radial dependence of $\\sigma$ and mean stellar mass become a\nfactor within $r_m$, or the cluster undergoes core collapse, the relationship\nbreaks down. We propose a method for determining $\\eta$ within $r_m$ from an\nobservational measurement of $\\delta_\\alpha$. In cases where $\\eta$ and\n$\\delta_\\alpha$ can be measured independently, this new method offers a way of\nmeasuring the cluster's dynamical state.\n", "  The time lag between optical and near-infrared continuum emission in active\ngalactic nuclei (AGN) shows a tight correlation with luminosity and has been\nproposed as a standardisable candle for cosmology. In this paper, we explore\nthe use of these AGN hot-dust time lags for cosmological model fitting under\nthe constraints of the new VISTA Extragalactic Infrared Legacy Survey VEILS.\nThis new survey will target a 9 deg^2 field observed in J- and Ks-band with a\n14-day cadence and will run for three years. The same area will be covered\nsimultaneously in the optical griz bands by the Dark Energy Survey, providing\ncomplementary time-domain optical data. We perform realistic simulations of the\nsurvey setup, showing that we expect to recover dust time lags for about 450\nobjects out of a total of 1350 optical type 1 AGN, spanning a redshift range of\n0.1 < z < 1.2. We use the lags recovered from our simulations to calculate\nprecise distance moduli, establish a Hubble diagram, and fit cosmological\nmodels. Assuming realistic scatter in the distribution of the dust around the\nAGN as well as in the normalisation of the lag-luminosity relation, we are able\nto constrain {\\Omega}_{\\Lambda} in {\\Lambda}CDM with similar accuracy as\ncurrent supernova samples. We discuss the benefits of combining AGN and\nsupernovae for cosmology and connect the present work to future attempts to\nreach out to redshifts of z > 4.\n", "  The frequency of Galactic stellar encounters the Solar system experienced\ndepends on the local density and velocity dispersion along the orbit of the Sun\nin the Milky Way galaxy. We aim at determining the effect of the radial\nmigration of the solar orbit on the rate of stellar encounters. As a first step\nwe integrate the orbit of the Sun backwards in time in an analytical potential\nof the Milky Way. We use the present-day phase-space coordinates of the Sun,\naccording to the measured uncertainties. The resulting orbits are inserted in\nan N-body simulation of the Galaxy, where the stellar velocity dispersion is\ncalculated at each position along the orbit of the Sun. We compute the rate of\nGalactic stellar encounters by employing three different solar orbits\n---migrating from the inner disk, without any substantial migration, and\nmigrating from the outer disk. We find that the rate for encounters within\n$4\\times10^5$ AU from the Sun is approximately 21, 39 and 63 Myr$^{-1}$,\nrespectively. The stronger encounters establish the outer limit of the\nso-called parking zone, which is the region in the plane of the orbital\neccentricities and semi-major axes where the planetesimals of the Solar system\nhave been perturbed only by interactions with stars belonging to the Sun's\nbirth cluster. We estimate the outer edge of the parking zone at semi-major\naxes of 250--1300 AU (the outward and inward migrating orbits reaching the\nsmallest and largest values, respectively), which is one order of magnitude\nsmaller than the determination made by Portegies Zwart & J\\'ilkov\\'a (2015). We\nfurther discuss the effect of stellar encounters on the stability of the\nhypothetical Planet 9.\n", "  Coalescing massive black hole binaries, formed during galaxy mergers, are\nexpected to be a primary source of low frequency gravitational waves. Yet in\nisolated gas-free spherical stellar systems, the hardening of the binary stalls\nat parsec-scale separations owing to the inefficiency of relaxation-driven\nloss-cone refilling. Repopulation via collisionless orbit diffusion in triaxial\nsystems is more efficient, but published simulation results are contradictory.\nWhile sustained hardening has been reported in simulations of galaxy mergers\nwith $N \\sim 10^6$ stars and in early simulations of rotating models, in\nisolated non-rotating triaxial models the hardening rate continues to fall with\nincreasing N, a signature of spurious two-body relaxation. We present a novel\napproach for studying loss cone repopulation in galactic nuclei. Since loss\ncone repopulation in triaxial systems owes to orbit diffusion, it is a purely\ncollisionless phenomenon and can be studied with an approximated force\ncalculation technique, provided the force errors are well behaved and\nsufficiently small. We achieve this using an accurate fast multipole method and\ndefine a proxy for the hardening rate that depends only on stellar angular\nmomenta. We find that the loss cone is efficiently replenished even in very\nmildly triaxial models (with axis ratios 1 : 0.9 : 0.8). Such triaxiality is\nunavoidable following galactic mergers and can drive binaries into the\ngravitational wave regime. We conclude that there is no final parsec problem.\n", "  We investigate the effect of epitaxial strain on the electrocaloric effect\n(ECE) in BaTiO$_3$ by means of ab initio based molecular dynamics simulations.\nWe show that tensile strain can be used to optimize the operation range for\nferroic cooling. Strain in the range of $\\leq 1$ % can be used to shift the\noperation temperature by several hundreds of Kelvin both to higher and lower\ntemperatures, depending on the direction of the external field. In addition,\nthe transformation between multi-domain and mono-domain states, induced by an\nin-plane electric field, results in an additional peak of the adiabatic\ntemperature change at lower temperatures, and a broad temperature interval\nwhere the caloric response scales linearly with the applied field strength,\neven up to very high fields.\n", "  We propose that the accretion disks fueling active galactic nuclei are\nsupported vertically against gravity by a strong toroidal ($\\phi-$direction)\nmagnetic field that develops naturally as the result of an accretion disk\ndynamo. The magnetic pressure elevates most of the gas carrying the accretion\nflow at $R$ to large heights $z > 0.1 R$ and low densities, while leaving a\nthin dense layer containing most of the mass --- but contributing very little\naccretion --- around the equator. We show that such a disk model leads\nnaturally to the formation of a broad emission line region through thermal\ninstability. Extrapolating to larger radii, we demonstrate that local\ngravitational instability and associated star formation are strongly suppressed\ncompared to standard disk models for AGN, although star formation in the\nequatorial zone is predicted for sufficiently high mass supply rates. This new\nclass of accretion disk models thus appears capable of resolving two\nlongstanding puzzles in the theory of AGN fueling: the formation of broad\nemission line regions and the suppression of fragmentation thought to inhibit\naccretion at the required rates. We show that the disk of stars that formed in\nthe Galactic Center a few million years ago could have resulted from an episode\nof magnetically elevated accretion at $> 0.1$ of the Eddington limit.\n", "  We recently developed a procedure to recognize gamma-ray blazar candidates\nwithin the positional uncertainty regions of the unidentified/unassociated\ngamma-ray sources (UGSs). Such procedure was based on the discovery that Fermi\nblazars show peculiar infrared colors. However, to confirm the real nature of\nthe selected candidates, optical spectroscopic data are necessary. Thus, we\nperformed an extensive archival search for spectra available in the literature\nin parallel with an optical spectroscopic campaign aimed to reveal and confirm\nthe nature of the selected gamma-ray blazar candidates. Here, we first search\nfor optical spectra of a selected sample of gamma-ray blazar candidates that\ncan be potential counterparts of UGSs using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS\nDR12). This search enables us to update the archival search carried out to\ndate. We also describe the state-of-art and the future perspectives of our\ncampaign to discover previously unknown gamma-ray blazars.\n", "  We analyse the spectra of black hole (BH) and neutron star (NS) X-ray\nbinaries (XBs) in the hard state using archival RXTE observations. We find that\nthere is a clear dichotomy in the strength of Comptonisation between NS and BH\nsources, as measured by both the Compton y-parameter and amplification factor\nA, with distinct groups of BH and NS XBs separated at y~0.9 and A~3. The\nelectron temperature kTe can occupy a broad range in BH systems, from\nkTe~30-200 keV, whereas for NSs kTe is peaked at ~15-25 keV, but can extend to\nhigher values. The difference between BHs and NSs in y implies that kTe is\nhigher at a given optical depth for BH XBs. Our results also imply that for NS\nsystems the accreting material loses ~1/2-2/3 of its energy through\nComptonisation in the corona. The remaining energy is released on the surface\nof the neutron star, making it a powerful source of soft radiation, which\nalters the properties of the Comptonising corona. Finally, we find evidence at\nthe 2.4 sigma confidence level that Comptonisation parameters may be correlated\nwith the neutron star spin, whereas no correlation with the BH spin is found.\nOur results highlight a further observational distinction between BH and NS XBs\nthat is a consequence of NSs possessing a physical surface.\n", "  We present a photometric study of the Andromeda XVIII dwarf spheroidal galaxy\nassociated with M31, and situated well outside of the virial radius of the M31\nhalo. The galaxy was resolved into stars with Hubble Space Telescope/Advanced\nCamera for Surveys revealing the old red giant branch and red clump. With the\nnew observational data we determined the Andromeda XVIII distance to be D =\n1.33+-0.08 Mpc using the tip of red giant branch method. Thus, the dwarf is\nsituated at the distance of 579 kpc from M31. We model the star formation\nhistory of Andromeda XVIII from the stellar photometry and Padova theoretical\nstellar isochrones. An ancient burst of star formation occurred 12-14 Gyr ago.\nThere is no sign of recent/ongoing star formation in the last 1.5 Gyr. The mass\nfractions of the ancient and intermediate age stars are 34 and 66 per cent,\nrespectively, and the total stellar mass is 4.2x10^6 Msun. It is probable that\nthe galaxy has not experienced an interaction with M31 in the past. We also\ndiscuss star formation processes of dSphs KKR 25, KKs 03, as well as dTr KK\n258. Their star formation histories were uniformly measured by us from HST/ACS\nobservations. All the galaxies are situated well beyond the Local Group and the\ntwo dSphs KKR 25 and KKs 03 are extremely isolated. Evidently, the evolution of\nthese objects has proceeded without influence of neighbours.\n", "  Absolute photoionisation cross sections for the Cl$^+$ ion in its ground and\nthe metastable states; $3s^2 3p^4\\; ^3P_{2,1,0}$, and $3s^2 3p^4\\; ^1D_2,\\;\n^1S_0$, were measured recently at the Advanced Light Source ALS) at Lawrence\nBerkeley National Laboratory using the merged beams photon-ion technique at an\nphoton energy resolution of 15 meV in the energy range 19 -- 28 eV. These\nmeasurements are compared with large-scale Dirac Coulomb {\\it R}-matrix\ncalculations in the same energy range. Photoionisation of this sulphur-like\nchlorine ion is characterized by multiple Rydberg series of autoionizing\nresonances superimposed on a direct photoionisation continuum. A wealth of\nresonance features observed in the experimental spectra are spectroscopically\nassigned and their resonance parameters tabulated and compared with the recent\nmeasurements. Metastable fractions in the parent ion beam are determined from\nthe present study. Theoretical resonance energies and quantum defects of the\nprominent Rydberg series $3s^2 3p^3 nd$, identified in the spectra as\n$3p\\rightarrow nd$ transitions are compared with the available measurements\nmade on this element. Weaker Rydberg series $3s^2 3p^3 ns$, identified as $3p\n\\rightarrow ns$ transitions and window resonances $3s3p^4 (^4P)np$ features,\ndue to $3s \\rightarrow np$ transitions are also found in the spectra.\n", "  We combine the decade long photometry of the Be/X-ray binary system A0538-66\nprovided by the MACHO and OGLE IV projects with high resolution SALT\nspectroscopy to provide detailed constraints on the orbital parameters and\nsystem properties. The ~420d superorbital modulation is present throughout, but\nhas reduced in amplitude in recent years. The well-defined 16.6409d orbital\noutbursts, which were a strong function of superorbital phase in the MACHO data\n(not occurring at all at superorbital maximum), are present throughout the OGLE\nIV coverage. However, their amplitude reduces during superorbital maximum. We\nhave refined the orbital period and ephemeris of the optical outburst based on\n~25 yrs light curves to HJD = 2455674.48 +/- 0.03 + n*16.6409 +/- 0.0003d. Our\nSALT spectra reveal a B1 III star with vsini of 285 km/s from which we have\nderived an orbital radial velocity curve which confirms the high eccentricity\nof e = 0.72 +/- 0.14. Furthermore, the mass function indicates that, unless the\nneutron star far exceeds the canonical 1.44 Msun, the donor must be\nsignificantly undermassive for its spectral type. We discuss the implications\nof the geometry and our derived orbital solution on the observed behaviour of\nthe system.\n", "  This work presents CHARA/VEGA H$\\alpha$ spectro-interferometry (R ~ 6000, and\n$\\lambda$/2B ~ 1 mas) of HD 179218 and HD 141569, doubling the sample of Herbig\nAe/Be (HAeBe) stars for which this type of observations is available so far.\nThe observed H$\\alpha$ emission is spatially unresolved, indicating that the\nsize of the H$\\alpha$ emitting region is smaller than ~ 0.21 and 0.12 au for HD\n179218 and HD 141529 (~ 15 and 16 R*, respectively). This is smaller than for\nthe two other HAeBes previously observed with the same instrumentation. Two\ndifferent scenarios have been explored in order to explain the compact line\nemitting regions. A hot, several thousand K, blackbody disc is consistent with\nthe observations of HD 179218 and HD 141569. Magnetospheric accretion (MA) is\nable to reproduce the bulk of the H$\\alpha$ emission shown by HD 179218,\nconfirming previous estimates from MA shock modelling with a mass accretion\nrate of 10^-8 Msun/yr, and an inclination to the line of sight between 30 and\n50 degr. The H$\\alpha$ profile of HD 141569 cannot be fitted from MA due to the\nhigh rotational velocity of this object. Putting the CHARA sample together, a\nvariety of scenarios is required to explain the H$\\alpha$ emission in HAeBe\nstars -compact or extended, discs, accretion, and winds-, in agreement with\nprevious Br$\\gamma$ spectro-interferometric observations.\n", "  Accurate determination of stellar atmospheric parameters and elemental\nabundances is crucial for Galactic archeology via large-scale spectroscopic\nsurveys. In this paper, we estimate stellar atmospheric parameters -- effective\ntemperature T_{\\rm eff}, surface gravity log g and metallicity [Fe/H], absolute\nmagnitudes M_V and M_{Ks}, {\\alpha}-element to metal (and iron) abundance ratio\n[{\\alpha}/M] (and [{\\alpha}/Fe]), as well as carbon and nitrogen abundances\n[C/H] and [N/H] from the LAMOST spectra with amultivariate regressionmethod\nbased on kernel-based principal component analysis, using stars in common with\nother surveys (Hipparcos, Kepler, APOGEE) as training data sets. Both internal\nand external examinations indicate that given a spectral signal-to-noise ratio\n(SNR) better than 50, our method is capable of delivering stellar parameters\nwith a precision of ~100K for Teff, ~0.1 dex for log g, 0.3 -- 0.4mag for M_V\nand M_{Ks}, 0.1 dex for [Fe/H], [C/H] and [N/H], and better than 0.05 dex for\n[{\\alpha}/M] ([{\\alpha}/Fe]). The results are satisfactory even for a spectral\nSNR of 20. The work presents first determinations of [C/H] and [N/H] abundances\nfrom a vast data set of LAMOST, and, to our knowledge, the first reported\nimplementation of absolute magnitude estimation directly based on the observed\nspectra. The derived stellar parameters for millions of stars from the LAMOST\nsurveys will be publicly available in the form of value-added catalogues.\n", "  Cluster state plays a crucial role in the one-way quantum computation. Here,\nwe propose and experimentally demonstrate a new scheme to prepare an\nultrahigh-fidelity four-photon linear cluster state via spontaneous parametric\ndown-conversion process. The state fidelity is measured to be\n$0.9517\\pm0.0027$. Our scheme can be directly extended to more photons to\ngenerate N-qubit linear cluster state. Furthermore, our scheme is optimal for\ngenerating photonic linear cluster states in the sense of achieving the maximal\nsuccess probability and having the simplest strategy. The key idea is that the\nphoton pairs are prepared in some special non-maximally entangled states\ninstead of the normal Bell states. To generate a 2N-qubit linear cluster state\nfrom N pairs of entangled photons, only (N-1) Hong-Ou-Mandel interferences are\nneeded and a success probability of $(\\frac{1}{4})^{N-1}$ is achieved.\n", "  We use high-precision photometry of red-giant-branch (RGB) stars in 57\nGalactic globular clusters (GCs), mostly from the `Hubble Space Telescope (HST)\nUV Legacy Survey of Galactic globular clusters', to identify and characterize\ntheir multiple stellar populations. For each cluster the pseudo two-color\ndiagram (or `chromosome map') is presented, built with a suitable combination\nof stellar magnitudes in the F275W, F336W, F438W and F814W filters that\nmaximizes the separation between multiple populations. In the chromosome map of\nmost GCs (Type I clusters), stars separate in two distinct groups that we\nidentify with the first (1G) and the second generation (2G). This\nidentification is further supported by noticing that 1G stars have primordial\n(oxygen-rich, sodium-poor) chemical composition, whereas 2G stars are enhanced\nin sodium and depleted in oxygen. This 1G-2G separation is not possible for a\nfew GCs where the two sequences have apparently merged into an extended,\ncontinuous sequence. In some GCs (Type II clusters) the 1G and/or the 2G\nsequences appear to be split, hence displaying more complex chromosome maps.\nThese clusters exhibit multiple SGBs also in purely optical color-magnitude\ndiagrams, with the fainter SGB joining into a red RGB which is populated by\nstars with enhanced heavy-element abundance. We measure the RGB width by using\nappropriate colors and pseudo-colors. When the metallicity dependence is\nremoved, the RGB width correlates with the cluster mass. The fraction of 1G\nstars ranges from ~8% to ~67% and anticorrelates with the cluster mass,\nindicating that incidence and complexity of the multiple population phenomenon\nboth increase with cluster mass.\n", "  The electronic response of a telescope under direct illumination by a\npoint-like light source is based on photon counting. With the data obtained\nusing the SNDICE light source and the Megacam camera on the CFHT telescope, we\nshow that the ultimate precision is only limited by the photon statistical\nfluctuation, which is below 1 ppm. A key feature of the analysis is the\nincorporation of diffuse light that interferes with specularly reflected light\nin the transmission model to explain the observed diffraction patterns. The\neffect of diffuse light, usually hidden conveniently in the Strehl ratio for an\nobject at infinity, is characterized with a precision of 10 ppm. In particular,\nthe spatial frequency representation provides some strong physical constraints\nand a practical monitoring of the roughness of various optical surfaces.\n", "  A significant fraction of OB-type, main-sequence massive stars are classified\nas runaway and move supersonically through the interstellar medium (ISM). Their\nstrong stellar winds interact with their surroundings where the typical\nstrength of the local ISM magnetic field is about 3.5-7 micro-G, which can\nresult in the formation of bow shock nebulae. We investigate the effects of\nsuch magnetic fields, aligned with the motion of the flow, on the formation and\nemission properties of these circumstellar structures. Our axisymmetric,\nmagneto-hydrodynamical simulations with optically-thin radiative cooling,\nheating and anisotropic thermal conduction show that the presence of the\nbackground ISM magnetic field affects the projected optical emission our bow\nshocks at Ha and [OIII] lambda 5007 which become fainter by about 1-2 orders of\nmagnitude, respectively. Radiative transfer calculations against dust opacity\nindicate that the magnetic field slightly diminishes their projected infrared\nemission and that our bow shocks emit brightly at 60 micron. This may explain\nwhy the bow shocks generated by ionizing runaway massive stars are often\ndifficult to identify. Finally, we discuss our results in the context of the\nbow shock of Zeta Ophiuchi and we support the interpretation of its imperfect\nmorphology as an evidence of the presence of an ISM magnetic field not aligned\nwith the motion of its driving star.\n", "  Residual speckles due to aberrations arising from optical errors after the\nsplit between the wavefront sensor and the science camera path are the most\nsignificant barriers to imaging extrasolar planets. While speckles can be\nsuppressed using the science camera in conjunction with the deformable mirror,\nthis requires knowledge of the phase of the electric field in the focal plane.\nWe describe a method which combines a coronagraph with a simple phase-shifting\ninterferometer to measure and correct speckles in the full focal plane. We\ndemonstrate its initial use on the Stellar Double Coronagraph at the Palomar\nObservatory. We also describe how the same hardware can be used to distinguish\nspeckles from true companions by measuring the coherence of the optical field\nin the focal plane. We present results observing the brown dwarf HD 49197b with\nthis technique, demonstrating the ability to detect the presence of a companion\neven when it is buried in the speckle noise, without the use of any standard\n\"calibration\" techniques. We believe this is the first detection of a\nsubstellar companion using the coherence properties of light.\n", "  In simulations of a model with topological sectors, algorithms which proceed\nin small update steps tend to get stuck in one sector, especially on fine\nlattices. This distorts the numerical results; in particular it is not\nstraightforward to measure the topological susceptibility chi_t. We test a\nmethod to measure chi_t even if configurations from only one sector are\navailable. It is based on the topological charges in sub-volumes, which we\ndenote as \"slab\". This enables the evaluation of chi_t, as we demonstrate with\nnumerical results for non-linear sigma-models and for 2-flavour QCD. In the\nlatter case, the gradient flow is applied for the smoothing of the gauge\nconfigurations, and the slab method results for chi_t are stable over a broad\nrange of flow times.\n", "  We reduced ESO's archival linear spectropolarimetry data (4000-9000\\AA) of 6\nhighly polarized and 8 unpolarized standard stars observed between 2010 and\n2016, for a total of 70 epochs, with the FOcal Reducer and low dispersion\nSpectrograph (FORS2) mounted at the Very Large Telescope. We provide very\naccurate standard stars polarization measurements as a function of wavelength,\nand test the performance of the spectropolarimetric mode (PMOS) of FORS2. We\nused the unpolarized stars to test the time stability of the PMOS mode, and\nfound a small ($\\leq$0.1%), but statistically significant, on-axis instrumental\npolarization wavelength dependency, possibly caused by the tilted surfaces of\nthe dispersive element. The polarization degree and angle are found to be\nstable at the level of $\\leq$0.1% and $\\leq$0.2 degrees, respectively. We\nderived the polarization wavelength dependence of the polarized standard stars\nand found that, in general, the results are consistent with those reported in\nthe literature, e.g. Fossati et al. (2007) who performed a similar analysis\nusing FORS1 data. The re-calibrated data provide a very accurate set of\nstandards that can be very reliably used for technical and scientific purposes.\nThe analysis of the Serkowski parameters revealed a systematic deviation from\nthe width parameter $K$ reported by Whittet et al. (1992). This is most likely\nexplained by incorrect effective wavelengths adopted in that study for the R\nand I bands.\n", "  We present high-resolution, long-slit spectroscopic observations of two\nplanetary nebulae with [WC] central stars located near the galactic bulge, M\n1-32 and M 3-15. The observations were obtained with the 2.1-m telescope at the\nObservatorio Astron\\'omico Nacional, San Pedro M\\'artir. M 1-32 shows wide\nwings on the base of its emission lines and M 3-15 has two very faint\nhigh-velocity knots. In order to model both PNe we built a three-dimensional\nmodel consisting of a jet interacting with an equatorially concentrated slow\nwind, emulating the presence of a dense torus, using the Yguaz\\'u\nhydrodynamical code. From our hydrodynamical models, we obtained\nposition-velocity (PV) diagrams in the [N II]$\\lambda$6583 line for comparison\nwith the observations. We find that the spectral characteristics of M 1-32 and\nM 3-15 can be explained with the same physical model -a jet moving inside an\nAGB wind- using different parameters (physical conditions and position angles\nof the jet). In agreement with our model and observations, these objects\ncontain a dense torus seeing pole-on and a bipolar jet escaping thorough the\npoles. Then we propose to classify this kind of objects as spectroscopic\nbipolar nebulae, although they have been classified morphologically as compact,\nround, or elliptical nebulae or with \"close collimated lobes\".\n", "  RS Ophiuchi is a symbiotic variable and a recurrent nova. We have monitored\nit with the Nordic Optical Telescope and obtained 30 high resolution (R=46 000)\noptical spectra over one orbital cycle during quiescence. To our knowledge this\nis the best-sampled high resolution spectroscopic dataset of RS Oph over one\norbital period. We do not detect any direct signatures of an accretion disc\nsuch as double peaked emission lines, but many line profiles are complex\nconsisting of superimposed emission and absorption components. We measure the\nspin of the red giant and conclude that it is tidally locked to the binary\norbit. We observe Na I absorption features, probably arising from the\ncircumbinary medium, that has been shaped by previous recurrent nova outbursts.\nWe do not detect any intrinsic polarisation in the optical wavelengths.\n", "  With an increasing number of superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) discovered the\nquestion of their origin remains open and causes heated debates in the\nsupernova community. Currently, there are three proposed mechanisms for SLSNe:\n(1) pair-instability supernovae (PISN), (2) magnetar-driven supernovae, and (3)\nmodels in which the supernova ejecta interacts with a circumstellar material\nejected before the explosion. Based on current observations of SLSNe, the PISN\norigin has been disfavoured for a number of reasons. Many PISN models provide\noverly broad light curves and too reddened spectra, because of massive ejecta\nand a high amount of nickel. In the current study we re-examine PISN properties\nusing progenitor models computed with the GENEC code. We calculate supernova\nexplosions with FLASH and light curve evolution with the radiation\nhydrodynamics code STELLA. We find that high-mass models (200 and 250 solar\nmasses) at relatively high metallicity (Z=0.001) do not retain hydrogen in the\nouter layers and produce relatively fast evolving PISNe Type I and might be\nsuitable to explain some SLSNe. We also investigate uncertainties in light\ncurve modelling due to codes, opacities, the nickel-bubble effect and\nprogenitor structure and composition.\n", "  For most galaxies, the shutdown of star formation was a slow process that\ntook four billion years. An analysis of thousands of galaxies suggests that\n'strangulation' by their environment was the most likely cause. See Letter on\npage 192 of Peng, Maiolino and Cochrane (2015), Nature, vol. 521.\n", "  The typical motions of a spinning test particle in Schwarzschild's background\nwhich show the strong repulsive action of the highly relativistic spin-gravity\ncoupling are considered using the exact Mathisson-Papapetrou equations. An\napproximated approach to choice solutions of these equations which describe\nmotions of the particle's proper center of mass is developed.\n", "  The fluctuating superconducting correlations emerging in dirty hybrid\nstructures in conditions of the strong proximity effect are demonstrated to\naffect the validity range of the widely used formalism of Usadel equations at\nmesoscopic scales. In superconductor -- ferromagnet (SF) structures these giant\nmesoscopic fluctuations originating from the interference effects for the\nCooper pair wave function in the presence of the exchange field can be\nresponsible for an anomalously slow decay of superconducting correlations in a\nferromagnet even when the non-collinear and spin-orbit effects are negligible.\nThe resulting sample-to-sample fluctuations of the Josephson current in SFS\njunctions and local density of states in SF hybrid structures can provide an\nexplanation of the long range proximity phenomena observed in mesoscopic\nsamples with collinear magnetization.\n", "  We present the abundance analysis for a sample of 17 red giant branch stars\nin the metal-poor globular cluster M28 based on high resolution spectra. This\nis the first extensive spectroscopic study of this cluster. We derive\nabundances of O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Y, Zr,\nBa, La, Ce, and Eu. We find a metallicity of [Fe/H]=-1.29+-0.01 and an\nalpha-enhancement of +0.34+-0.01 (errors on the mean), typical of Halo Globular\nClusters in this metallicity regime. A large spread is observed in the\nabundances of light elements O, Na, and Al. Mg also shows an anticorrelation\nwith Al with a significance of 3 sigma. The cluster shows a Na-O\nanticorrelation and a Na-Al correlation. This correlation is not linear but\n\"segmented\" and that the stars are not distributed continuously, but form at\nleast 3 well separated sub-populations. In this aspect M28 resembles NGC~2808\nthat was found to host at least 5 sub-populations. The presence of a Mg-Al\nanticorrelation favor massive AGB stars as the main polluters responsible for\nthe multiple-population phenomenon.\n", "  We studied magneto-optical response of a canonical topological insulator\nBi$_2$Se$_3$ with the goal of addressing a controversial issue of\nelectron-phonon coupling. Magnetic-field induced modifications of reflectance\nare very pronounced in the infrared part of the spectrum, indicating strong\nelectron-phonon coupling. This coupling causes an asymmetric line-shape of the\n60 cm$^{-1}$ phonon mode, and is analyzed within the Fano formalism. The\nanalysis reveals that the Fano asymmetry parameter (q) changes sign when the\ncyclotron resonance is degenerate with the phonon mode. To the best of our\nknowledge this is the first example of magnetic field driven q-reversal.\n", "  The linear hydrodynamic stability of a model for confined\nquasi-two-dimensional granular gases is analyzed. The system exhibits\nhomogeneous hydrodynamics, i.e. there are macroscopic evolution equations for\nhomogeneous states. The stability analysis is carried out around all these\nstates and not only the homogeneous steady state reached eventually by the\nsystem. It is shown that in some cases the linear analysis is not enough to\nreach a definite conclusion on the stability, and molecular dynamics simulation\nresults are presented to elucidate these cases. The analysis shows the\nrelevance of nonlinear hydrodynamic contributions to describe the behavior of\nspontaneous fluctuations occurring in the system, that lead even to the\ntransitory formation of clusters of particles. The conclusion is that the\nsystem is always stable. The relevance of the results for describing the\ninstabilities of confined granular gases observed experimentally is discussed.\n", "  This note is devoted to the study of the well-posedness of the Cauchy problem\nfor the Landau Hamiltonian wave equation in the plane, with nonzero constant\nmagnetic field. We show the well-posedness in suitably defined Sobolev spaces\ntaking into account the spectral properties of the operator.\n", "  We performed a series of 29 gasdynamical simulations of disc galaxies, barred\nand unbarred, with various stellar masses, to study the impact of the bar on\nstar formation history. Unbarred galaxies evolve very smoothly, with a star\nformation rate (SFR) that varies by at most a factor of three over a period of\n2 Gyr. The evolution of barred galaxies is much more irregular, especially at\nhigh stellar masses. In these galaxies, the bar drives a substantial amount of\ngas toward the centre, resulting in a high SFR, and producing a starburst in\nthe most massive galaxies. Most of the gas is converted into stars, and gas\nexhaustion leads to a rapid drop of star formation after the starburst. In\nmassive barred galaxies (stellar mass M* > 2x10^10 Msun) the large amount of\ngas funnelled toward the centre is completely consumed by the starburst, while\nin lower-mass barred galaxies it is only partially consumed. Gas concentration\nis thus higher in lower-mass barred galaxies than it is in higher-mass ones.\nEven though unbarred galaxies funnelled less gas toward their centre, the lower\nSFR allows this gas to accumulate. At late times, the star formation efficiency\nis higher in barred galaxies than unbarred ones, enabling these galaxies to\nmaintain a higher SFR with a smaller gas supply. Several properties, such as\nthe global SFR, central SFR, or central gas concentration, vary monotonically\nwith time for unbarred galaxies, but not for barred galaxies. Therefore one\nmust be careful when comparing barred and unbarred galaxies that share one\nobservational property, since these galaxies might be at very different stages\nof their respective evolution.\n", "  In this paper, the contributions of weak annihilation and hard spectator\nscattering in $B\\to \\rho K^*$, $ K^* \\bar{K}^*$, $\\phi K^*$, $\\rho\\rho$ and\n$\\phi\\phi$ decays are investigated within the framework of QCD factorization.\nUsing the experimental data available, we perform $\\chi^2$ analyses of\nend-point parameters in four cases based on the topology-dependent and\npolarization-dependent parameterization schemes. The fitted results indicate\nthat: (i) In the topology-dependent scheme, the relation\n$(\\rho_A^{i},\\phi_A^{i})\\neq (\\rho_A^{f},\\phi_A^{f})$ gotten through $B\\to PP$\nand $PV$ decays is favored by the penguin-dominated $B\\to VV$ decays at 95\\% C.\nL., (ii) The large hard spectator scattering corrections and/or the\nsimplification $ (\\rho_H,\\phi_H)= (\\rho_A^{i},\\phi_A^{i})$ are challenged by\n${\\cal B}(\\bar{B}^0\\to \\rho^0 \\rho^0)$, even though they are allowed by $B\\to\nPP$ and $PV$ decays and helpful for resolving \"$\\pi\\pi$ puzzle\", (iii) In the\npolarization-dependent scheme, the relation $(\\rho_A^{L},\\phi_A^{L})\\neq\n(\\rho_A^{T},\\phi_A^{T})$ is always required. Moreover, we have updated the\ntheoretical results for $B\\to VV$ decays with the best-fit values of end-point\nparameters. A few observables, such as the ones of pure annihilation $B_d\\to\n\\phi \\phi$ decay, are also identified for probing the annihilation corrections.\n", "  Permanent magnets with yokes are widely used in the watt and joule balances\nto measure the Planck constant for the forthcoming redefinition of the unit of\nmass, the kilogram. Recently, a permanent magnet system has been in\nconsideration for a further practice of NIM-2, the generalized joule balance.\nIn this paper, an analytical model to design the permanent magnet system is\npresented. The presented model can be solved to obtain the preliminary\nparameters and then is used as guidance for FEA software to optimize the\nparameters of such magnetic system. As an instance for the application of the\ndesigning model, the design of the permanent magnet system for NIM-2 is\ndescribed and the special design of opening shape makes the misalignment of the\ntop and middle yokes has little influence on the vertical component of the\nmagnetic field.\n", "  An oscillation with a period of about 2100-2500 years, the Hallstatt cycle,\nis found in cosmogenic radioisotopes (C-14 and Be-10) and in paleoclimate\nrecords throughout the Holocene. Herein we demonstrate the astronomical origin\nof this cycle. Namely, this oscillation is coherent to the major stable\nresonance involving the four Jovian planets - Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and\nNeptune - whose period is p=2318 yr. The Hallstatt cycle could derive from the\nrhythmic variation of the circularity of the solar system disk assuming that\nthis dynamics could eventually modulate the solar wind and, consequently, the\nincoming cosmic ray flux and/or the interplanetary/cosmic dust concentration\naround the Earth-Moon system. The orbit of the planetary mass center (PMC)\nrelative to the Sun is used as a proxy. We analyzed how the instantaneous\neccentricity vector of this virtual orbit varies from 13,000 B. C. to 17,000 A.\nD.. We found that it undergoes kind of pulsations as it clearly presents\nrhythmic contraction and expansion patterns with a 2318 yr period together with\na number of already known faster oscillations associated to the planetary\norbital stable resonances. We found that a fast expansion of the Sun-PMC orbit\nfollowed by a slow contraction appears to prevent cosmic rays to enter within\nthe system inner region while a slow expansion followed by a fast contraction\nfavors it. Similarly, the same dynamics could modulate the amount of\ninterplanetary/cosmic dust falling on Earth. These would then cause both the\nradionucleotide production and climate change by means of a cloud/albedo\nmodulation. Other stable orbital resonance frequencies (e.g. at periods of 20\nyr, 45 yr, 60 yr, 85 yr, 159-171-185 yr, etc.) are found in radionucleotide,\nsolar, aurora and climate records, as determined in the scientific literature.\nThus, the result supports a planetary theory of solar and/or climate variation.\n", "  We present detailed spectral calculations for small Lieb lattices having up\nto $N=4$ number of cells, in the regime of half-filling, an instance of\nparticular relevance for the nano-magnetism of discrete systems such as quantum\ndot arrays, due to the degenerate levels at mid-spectrum. While for the Hubbard\ninteraction model -and even number of sites- the ground state spin is given by\nthe Lieb theorem, the inclusion of long range interaction -or odd number of\nsites- make the spin state not a priori known, which justifies our approach. We\ncalculate also the excitation energies, which are of experimental importance,\nand find significant variation induced by the interaction potential. One\nobtains insights on the mechanisms involved that impose as ground state the\nLieb state with lower spin rather than the Hund one with maximum spin for the\ndegenerate levels, showing this in the first and second order of the\ninteraction potential for the smaller lattices. The analytical results concorde\nwith the numerical ones, which are performed by exact diagonalization\ncalculations or by a combined mean-field and configuration interaction method.\nWhile the Lieb state is always lower in energy than the Hund state, for strong\nlong-range interaction, when possible, another minimal spin state is imposed as\nground state.\n", "  Recently, we have suggested some semi-quantitative Hamiltonian for an\nelectron in a hydrogen atom in a weak gravitational field, which takes into\naccount quantum effects of electron motion in the atom. We have shown that this\nHamiltonian predicts breakdown of the equivalence between passive electron\ngravitational mass and its energy. Moreover, as has been shown by us, the\nlatter phenomenon can be experimentally observed as unusual emission of\nradiation from an ensemble of the atoms, provided that they are moved in the\nEarth's gravitational field with constant velocity by some spacecraft. In this\narticle, we derive the above-mentioned Hamiltonian from the Dirac equation in a\ncurved spacetime. It is shown that it exactly coincides with the\nsemi-quantitative Hamiltonian, used in our previous papers. We extend the\nobtained Hamiltonian to the case of a spacecraft, containing a macroscopic\nensemble of the atoms and moving with a constant velocity in the Earth's\ngravitational field. On this basis, we discuss some idealized and realistic\nexperiments on the Earth's orbit. If such (realistic) experiment is done, it\nwill be the first direct observation of quantum effects in the General\nRelativity.\n", "  Earth sustains its magnetic field by a dynamo process driven by convection in\nthe liquid outer core. Geodynamo simulations have been successful in\nreproducing many observed properties of the geomagnetic field. However, while\ntheoretical considerations suggest that flow in the core is governed by a\nbalance between Lorentz force, rotational force and buoyancy (called MAC\nbalance for Magnetic, Archimedean, Coriolis) with only minute roles for viscous\nand inertial forces, dynamo simulations must employ viscosity values that are\nmany orders of magnitude larger than in the core due to computational\nconstraints. In typical geodynamo models viscous and inertial forces are not\nmuch smaller than the Coriolis force and the Lorentz force plays a sub-dominant\nrole. This has led to conclusions that these simulations are viscously\ncontrolled and do not represent the physics of the geodynamo. Here we show by a\ndirect analysis of the relevant forces that a MAC balance can be achieved when\nthe viscosity is reduced to values close to the current practical limit.\nLorentz force, buoyancy and the uncompensated (by pressure) part of the\nCoriolis force are of very similar strength, whereas viscous and inertia are\nsmaller by a factor of at least 20 in the bulk of the fluid volume. Compared to\nnon-magnetic convection at otherwise identical parameters, the dynamo flow is\nof larger scale, less invariant parallel to the rotation axis (less\ngeostrophic) and convection transports twice as much heat, all of which is\nexpected when the Lorentz force strongly influences the convection properties.\n", "  The two main data categories of vehicular traffic flow, stationary detector\ndata and floating-car data, are also available for many Marathons and other\nmass-sports events: Loop detectors and other stationary data sources find their\ncounterpart in the RFID tags of the athletes recording the split times at\nseveral stations during the race. Additionally, more and more athletes use\nsmart-phone apps generating track data points that are the equivalent of\nfloating-car data. We present a methodology to detect congestions and estimate\nthe location of jam-fronts, the delay times, and the spatio-temporal speed and\ndensity distribution of the athlete's crowd flow by fusing these two data\nsources based on a first-order macroscopic model with triangular fundamental\ndiagram. The method can be used in real-time or for analyzing past events.\nUsing synthetic \"ground truth\" data generated by simulations with the\nIntelligent-Driver Model, we show that, in a real-time application, the\nproposed algorithm is robust and effective with minimal data requirements.\nGenerally, two stationary data sources and about ten \"floating-athlete\"\ntrajectories per hour are sufficient.\n", "  When a subdominant light scalar field ends slow roll during inflation, but\nwell after the Hubble exit of the pivot scales, it may determine the\ncosmological perturbations. This thesis investigates how such a scalar field,\nthe spectator, may leave its impact on the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)\nradiation and be consequently constrained. We first introduce the observables\nof the CMB, namely the power spectrum $P_\\zeta$, spectral index $n_s$ and its\nrunning $dn_s/d\\ln k$, the non-Gaussianities $f_{NL}$, $g_{NL}$ and\n$\\tau_{NL}$, and the lack of isocurvature and polarization modes. Based on\nthese studies, we derive the cosmological predictions for the spectator\nscenario, revealing its consistency with the CMB for inflection point\npotentials, hyperbolic tangent potentials, and those with a sudden phase\ntransition. In the end, we utilize the spectator scenario to explain the CMB\npower asymmetry, with a brief tachyonic fast-roll phase.\n", "  The NGSIM trajectory data are used to calibrate two car-following models -\nthe IDM and the FVDM. We used the I80 dataset which has already been\nreconstructed to eliminate outliers, unphysical data, and internal and platoon\ninconsistencies contained in the original data.We extract from the data\nleader-follower pairs and platoons of up to five consecutive vehicles thereby\neliminating all trajectories that are too short or contain lane changes. Four\nerror measures based on speed and gap deviations are considered. Furthermore,\nwe apply three calibration methods: local or direct calibration, global\ncalibration, and platoon calibration. The last approach means that a platoon of\nseveral vehicles following a data-driven leader is simulated and compared to\nthe observed dynamics.\n", "  We present a protocol that transforms any quantum multi-prover interactive\nproof into a nonlocal game in which questions consist of logarithmic number of\nbits and answers of constant number of bits. As a corollary, this proves that\nthe promise problem corresponding to the approximation of the nonlocal value to\ninverse polynomial accuracy is complete for QMIP*, and therefore NEXP-hard.\nThis establishes that nonlocal games are provably harder than classical games\nwithout any complexity theory assumptions. Our result also indicates that gap\namplification for nonlocal games may be impossible in general and provides a\nnegative evidence for the possibility of the gap amplification approach to the\nmulti-prover variant of the quantum PCP conjecture.\n", "  In a range of citation networks, the in-degree distributions boast\ntime-periodicity---the distributions of citations per article published each\nyear present similar scale-free tails. This phenomenon can be regarded as a\nconsequence of the emergence of hot topics and the existence of the \"burst\"\nphenomenon. With this inference considered, a geometric model based on our\nprevious study is established, in which the sizes of the influence zones of\nnodes follow the same power-law distribution and decrease with their ages. The\nmodel successfully reproduces the time-periodicity of the in-degree\ndistributions of the empirical data, and accounts for the presence of citation\nburst as well. Moreover, a reasonable explanation for the emergence of the\nscale-free tails by regarding the citation behavior between articles as a\n\"yes/no\" experiment is presented. The model can also predict the\ntime-periodicity of the local clustering coefficients, which indicates that the\nmodel is a good tool in researches on the evolutionary mechanism of citation\nnetworks.\n", "  The Astropy Project (http://astropy.org) is, in its own words, \"a community\neffort to develop a single core package for Astronomy in Python and foster\ninteroperability between Python astronomy packages.\" For five years this\nproject has been managed, written, and operated as a grassroots,\nself-organized, almost entirely volunteer effort while the software is used by\nthe majority of the astronomical community. Despite this, the project has\nalways been and remains to this day effectively unfunded. Further, contributors\nreceive little or no formal recognition for creating and supporting what is now\ncritical software. This paper explores the problem in detail, outlines possible\nsolutions to correct this, and presents a few suggestions on how to address the\nsustainability of general purpose astronomical software.\n", "  This is a copy of the 2009 Princeton University thesis which examined various\naspects of gauge/gravity duality, including renormalization group flows, phase\ntransitions of the holographic entanglement entropy, and instabilities\nassociated with the breaking of supersymmetry. Chapter 5 contains new\nunpublished material on various instabilities of the weakly curved\nnon-supersymmetric $AdS_4$ backgrounds of M-theory.\n", "  The birth of attosecond light sources is expected to inspire a breakthrough\nin ultrafast optics, which may extend human real-time measurement and control\ntechniques into atomic-scale electronic dynamics. For applications, it is\nessential to obtain a single attosecond pulse of high intensity, large photon\nenergy and short duration. Here we show that single 100-terawatt attosecond\nX-ray light pulse with intensity ${1\\times10^{21}}\\textrm{W}/\\textrm{cm}^{{\n2}}$ and duration ${7.9} \\textrm{as}$ can be produced by intense laser\nirradiation on a capacitor-nanofoil target composed of two separate nanofoils.\nIn the interaction, a strong electrostatic potential develops between two\nnanofoils, which drags electrons out of the second foil and piles them up in\nvacuum, forming an ultradense relativistic electron nanobunch. This nanobunch\nexists in only half a laser cycle and smears out in others, resulting in\ncoherent synchrotron emission of a single pulse. Such an unprecedentedly giant\nattosecond X-ray pulse may bring us to view a real attoworld.\n", "  I present two interesting studies related to the role of solitons in theories\nwith spontaneous symmetry breaking. Quantised fermions coupled to solitons are\nknown to induce fractional fermion number. I present an example where an\nunstable topological solution binding a zero mode of a majorana fermion gets\nstabilised due to the induced fractional number. Thus neither is the cosmic\nstring stable nor is the fermion number conserved, yet the bound state then\nbecomes stable due to Quantum Mechanics. The other phenomenon concerns a\nmetastable vacuum getting destabilised due to the presence of a cosmic string.\nThis happens because the scalar field signalling spontaneous symmetry breaking\nacquires a vacuum expectation value approaching its true vacuum value in the\ncore of the string. Thus the string acts like a seed nucleating the true\nvacuum. The instanton mediating between the false vacuum and the exit point\ninto the true vacuum is shown to exist and graphically displayed through a\nnumeric calculation. T. Padmanabhan has been a long time friend and was\ncollaborator for early investigations in this direction. I review these works\ndone subsequently with other collaborators as a felicitation to him on his\nsixtieth birthday.\n", "  This paper establishes certain existence and classification results for\nsolutions to $SU(n)$ Toda systems with three singular sources at 0, 1, and\n$\\infty$. First, we determine the necessary conditions for such an $SU(n)$ Toda\nsystem to be related to an $n$th order hypergeometric equation. Then, we\nconstruct solutions for $SU(n)$ Toda systems that satisfy the necessary\nconditions and also the interlacing conditions from Beukers and Heckman.\nFinally, for $SU(3)$ Toda systems satisfying the necessary conditions, we\nclassify, under a natural reality assumption, that all the solutions are\nrelated to hypergeometric equations. This proof uses the Pohozaev identity.\n", "  As one of the most influential experiments on the development of modern\nmacroscopic theory from Newtonian mechanics to Einstein's special theory of\nrelativity, the phenomenon of light dragging in a moving medium has been\ndiscussed and observed extensively in different types of systems. To have a\nsignificant dragging effect, the long duration of light travelling in the\nmedium is preferred. Here we demonstrate a light-dragging experiment in an\nelectromagnetically induced transparent cold atomic ensemble and enhance the\ndragging effect by at least three orders of magnitude compared with the\nprevious experiments. With a large enhancement of the dragging effect, we\nrealize an atom-based velocimeter that has a sensitivity two orders of\nmagnitude higher than the velocity width of the atomic medium used. Such a\ndemonstration could pave the way for motional sensing using the collective\nstate of atoms in a room temperature vapour cell or solid state material.\n", "  Interaction between tannin and bovine serum albumin (BSA) was examined by the\nfluorescent quenching. The process of elimination between BSA and tannin was\nthe one of a stationary state, and the coupling coefficient was one. The\nworking strength between the tannin and the beef serum was hydrophobic one.\n", "  We report detailed study of angular-dependent magnetoresistance (AMR) with\ntilting angel $\\theta$ from $c$-axis ranging from 0$^\\circ$ to 360$^\\circ$ on a\nhigh-quality FeSe single crystal. A pronounced AMR with twofold symmetry is\nobserved, which is caused by the quasi two-dimensional (2D) Fermi surface. The\npronounced AMR is observed only in the orthorhombic phase, indicating that the\nquasi-2D Fermi surface is induced by the structural transition. Details about\nthe influence of the multiband effect to the AMR are also discussed. Besides,\nthe angular response of a possible Dirac-cone-like band structure is\ninvestigated by analyzing the detailed magnetoresistance at different $\\theta$.\nThe obtained characteristic field ($B^*$) can be also roughly scaled in the 2D\napproximation, which indicates that the Dirac-cone-like state is also 2D in\nnature.\n", "  Boyajian's Star (KIC 8462852) undergoes mysterious, irregular eclipses that\naren't yet explained. It also appears to have dimmed over a time of several\nyears, possibly decades. I show that Kepler's detection of a phenomenon with a\nduration of t_anom is only expected if it occurs at a mean rate of >~ 30\nGyr^(-1) (t_anom / 100 yr)^(-1) for each Kepler target and K2 star. If true,\nthe phenomenon occurs hundreds of times during the lifespan of its host stars.\nObscuration by the interstellar medium remains a plausible explanation, since\nit doesn't actually affect the host star. An intervening cloud is consistent\nwith the lack of an observed submillimeter excess but would be abnormally\ndilute.\n", "  This comment clarifies the mixed definition of the cerium valence in the\narticle entitled: Quantitative study of the $f$ occupation in CeMIn5 and other\ncerium compounds with hard X-rays, published in Journal of Electron\nSpectroscopy and Related Phenomena\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0368204816300123 and\navailable on arXiv:1601.03270. Indeed, it is unclear wether electrons belonging\non hybridized f-states are part or not of the valence. When one tries to\nsimulate the system, an Anderson impurity model only includes valence bands\nelectrons and localized 4-f states. Therefore hybridized 4-f states are mixed\nwith the localized ones. From a heavy fermion perspective it however essential\nto differentiate hybridized and localized states as only the second are\nresponsible for strong correlations, such as obtained by susceptibility or\ndirect comparisons to model systems.\n", "  In this paper, we discuss the formation of ring-shaped and gyro-phase\nrestricted velocity distribution functions (VDFs) at the edges of a cloud of\nprotons injected into non-uniform distributions of the electromagnetic field.\nThe velocity distribution function is reconstructed using the forward\ntest-kinetic method. We consider two profiles of the electric field: (1) a\nnon-uniform E-field obtained by solving the Laplace equation consistent with\nthe conservation of the electric drift and (2) a constant and uniform E-field.\nIn both cases, the magnetic field is similar to the solutions obtained for\ntangential discontinuities. The initial velocity distribution function is\nLiouville mapped along numerically integrated trajectories. The numerical\nresults show the formation of an energy-dispersed structure due to the\nenergy-dependent displacement of protons towards the edges of the cloud by the\ngradient-B drift. Another direct effect of the gradient-B drift is the\nformation of ring-shaped velocity distribution functions within the\nvelocity-dispersed structure. Higher energy particles populate the edges of the\nproton beam, while smaller energies are located in the core. Non-gyrotropic\nvelocity distribution functions form on the front-side and trailing edge of the\ncloud; this effect is due to remote sensing of energetic particles with guiding\ncenters inside the beam. The kinetic features revealed by the test-kinetic\nsolutions have features similar to in-situ velocity distribution functions\nobserved by Cluster satellites in the magnetotail, close to the neutral sheet.\n", "  In this paper we perform a comparative study of the forward and backward\nLiouville mapping applied to the modeling of ring-shaped and non-gyrotropic\nvelocity distribution functions of particles injected in a sheared\nelectromagnetic field. The test-kinetic method is used to compute the velocity\ndistribution function in various areas of a proton cloud moving in the vicinity\nof a region with a sharp transition of the magnetic field and a non-uniform\nelectric field. In the forward approach the velocity distribution function is\ncomputed for a two-dimensional spatial bin, while in the backward approach the\ndistribution function is averaged over a spatial bin with the same size as for\nthe forward method and using a two-dimensional trapezoidal integration scheme.\nIt is shown that the two approaches lead to similar results for spatial bins\nwhere the velocity distribution function varies smoothly. On the other hand,\nwith bins covering regions of configuration space characterized by sharp\nspatial gradients of the velocity distribution function, the forward and\nbackward approaches will generally provide different results.\n", "  It is now well established that nearby beating pairs of eukaryotic flagella\nor cilia typically synchronize in phase. A substantial body of evidence\nsupports the hypothesis that hydrodynamic coupling between the active\nfilaments, combined with waveform compliance, provides a robust mechanism for\nsynchrony. This elastohydrodynamic mechanism has been incorporated into\n`bead-spring' models in which flagella are represented by microspheres tethered\nby radial springs as internal forces drive them about orbits. While these\nlow-dimensional models reproduce the phenomenon of synchrony, their parameters\nare not readily relatable to those of flagella. More realistic models which\nreflect the elasticity of the axonemes and active force generation take the\nform of fourth-order nonlinear PDEs. While computational studies have shown\nsynchrony, the effects of hydrodynamic coupling between nearby filaments\ngoverned by such models have been theoretically examined only in the regime of\ninterflagellar distances $d$ large compared to flagellar length $L$. Yet, in\nmany biological situations $d/L \\ll 1$. Here, we first present an asymptotic\nanalysis of the hydrodynamic coupling between two filaments in the regime $d/L\n\\ll 1$, and find that the form of the coupling is independent of the details of\nthe internal forces that govern the motion of the filaments. The analysis is\nlike the localized induction approximation for vortex filament motion, extended\nto the case of mutual induction. To understand how the coupling mechanism leads\nto synchrony of extended objects, we introduce a heuristic model of flagellar\nbeating, a single fourth-order nonlinear PDE whose form is derived from\nsymmetry considerations, the physics of elasticity, and the overdamped nature\nof the dynamics. Analytical and numerical studies of this model illustrate how\nsynchrony between two filaments is achieved through the asymptotic coupling.\n", "  We separate the contributions of parton distributions from higher twist\ncorrections to the deeply inelastic lepton-proton scattering in the resonance\nregion using the Jefferson Lab data at low $Q^2$. The study indicates that the\nconcept of the valence quarks and their distributions are indispensable even at\n$Q^2<1GeV^2$. The quark-hadron duality is also discussed.\n", "  Ultracold atoms can be used to perform quantum simulations of a variety of\ncondensed matter systems, including spin systems. These progresses point to the\nimplementation of the manipulation of quantum states and to observe and exploit\nthe effect of quantum correlations. A natural direction along this line is\nprovided by the possibility to perform quantum state transfer (QST). After\npresenting a brief discussion of the simulation of quantum spin chains with\nultracold gases and reminding the basic facts of QST, we discuss how to\npotentially use the tools of present-day ultracold technology to implement the\nQST between two regions of the atomic system (the sender and the receiver). The\nfidelity and the typical timescale of the QST are discussed, together with\npossible limitations and applications of the presented results.\n", "  We realize a two-qubit sensor designed for achieving high spectral resolution\nin quantum sensing experiments. Our sensor consists of an active \"sensing\nqubit\" and a long-lived \"memory qubit\", implemented by the electronic and the\nnitrogen-15 nuclear spins of a nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond,\nrespectively. Using state storage times of up to 45 ms, we demonstrate\nspectroscopy of external ac signals with a line width of 19 Hz (~2.9 ppm) and\nof carbon-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) signals with a line width of 190\nHz (~ 74 ppm). This represents an up to 100-fold improvement in spectral\nresolution compared to measurements without nuclear memory.\n", "  We present an elaborate version of the hadron resonance gas model with the\ncombined treatment of separate chemical freeze-outs for strange and non-strange\nhadrons and with an additional $\\gamma_{s}$ factor which accounts for the\nremaining strange particle non-equilibration. Within suggested approach the\nparameters of two chemical freeze-outs are connected by the conservation laws\nof entropy, baryonic charge, third isospin projection and strangeness. The\ndeveloped model enables us to perform a high-quality fit of the hadron\nmultiplicity ratios measured at AGS, SPS and RHIC with $\\chi^2/dof \\simeq\n0.93$. A special attention is paid to a successful description of the\nStrangeness Horn. The well-known problem of selective suppression of $\\bar\n\\Lambda $ and $\\bar \\Xi$ hyperons is also discussed. The main result is that\nfor all collision energies the $\\gamma_{s}$ factor is about 1 within the error\nbars, except for the center of mass collision energy 7.6 GeV at which we find\nabout 20\\% enhancement of strangeness. Also we confirm an existence of strong\njumps in pressure, temperature and effective number of degrees of freedom at\nthe stage of strange particle chemical freeze-out, when the center of mass\ncollision energy changes from 4.3 to 4.9 GeV. We argue that these\nirregularities may signal about the quark-hadron phase transition.\n", "  A new nine-dimensional potential energy surface (PES) for methane has been\ngenerated using state-of-the-art \\textit{ab initio} theory. The PES is based on\nexplicitly correlated coupled cluster calculations with extrapolation to the\ncomplete basis set limit and incorporates a range of higher-level additive\nenergy corrections. These include: core-valence electron correlation,\nhigher-order coupled cluster terms beyond perturbative triples, scalar\nrelativistic effects and the diagonal Born-Oppenheimer correction.\nSub-wavenumber accuracy is achieved for the majority of experimentally known\nvibrational energy levels with the four fundamentals of $^{12}$CH$_4$\nreproduced with a root-mean-square error of $0.70{\\,}$cm$^{-1}$. The computed\n\\textit{ab initio} equilibrium C{--}H bond length is in excellent agreement\nwith previous values despite pure rotational energies displaying minor\nsystematic errors as $J$ (rotational excitation) increases. It is shown that\nthese errors can be significantly reduced by adjusting the equilibrium\ngeometry. The PES represents the most accurate \\textit{ab initio} surface to\ndate and will serve as a good starting point for empirical refinement.\n", "  We provide details of the lattice construction of five-dimensional maximally\nsupersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. The lattice theory is supersymmetric, gauge\ninvariant and free from spectrum doublers. Such a supersymmetric lattice\nformulation is interesting as it can be used for non-perturbative explorations\nof the five-dimensional theory, which has a known gravitational dual.\n", "  Plasma wakefields driven inside a hollow-channel plasma are significantly\ndifferent from those driven in a homogeneous plasma. This work investigates the\nscaling laws of the accelerating and focusing fields in the \"crunch-in\" regime.\nThis regime is excited due to the collapse of the electron-rings from the\nchannel walls onto the propagation axis of the energy-source, in its wake. This\nregime is thus the non-linearly driven hollow channel, since the electron-ring\ndisplacement is of the order of the channel radius. We present the properties\nof the coherent structures in the \"crunch-in\" regime where the channel radius\nis matched to the beam properties such that channel-edge to on-axis collapse\ntime has a direct correspondence to the energy source intensity. We also\ninvestigate the physical mechanisms that underlie the \"crunch-in\" wakefields by\ntuning the channel radius. Using a theoretical framework and results from PIC\nsimulations the possible applications of the \"crunch-in\" regime for\nacceleration of positron beams with collider-scale parameters is presented.\n", "  We consider the weighted isotropic relaxed micromorphic model and provide an\nin depth investigation of the characteristic dispersion curves when the\nconstitutive parameters of the model are varied. The weighted relaxed\nmicromorphic model generalizes the classical relaxed micromorphic model\npreviously introduced by the authors, since it features the Cartan-Lie\ndecomposition of the tensors $P_{,t}$ and Curl $P$ in their dev, dev sym, skew\nand spheric part. It is shown that the split of the tensor $P_{,t}$ in the\nmicro-inertia provide an independent control of the cut-offs of the optic\nbenches. This is crucial for the future calibration of the relaxed micromorphic\nmodel on real band-gap metamaterials.\n  Even if the physical interest of the introduction of the split of the tensor\nCurl $P$ is less evident than in the previous case, we discuss in detail which\nis its effect on the dispersion curves. Finally, we also provide a complete\nparametric study involving all the constitutive parameters of the introduced\nmodel, so giving rise to an exhaustive panorama of dispersion curves for the\nrelaxed micromorphic model.\n", "  Surface chemistry is important across diverse fields such as corrosion and\nnanostructure synthesis. Unfortunately, many as-synthesized nanomaterials,\nincluding partially dealloyed nanoparticle catalysts for fuel cells, with\nhighly active surfaces are not stable in their reactive environments,\npreventing widespread application. Thus, understanding instability by focusing\non the structure-stability and defect-stability relationship at the nanoscale\nis crucial and will likely play an important role in meeting grand challenges.\nTo this end, recent advances in imaging nanostructure stability have come via\nboth electron, x-ray, and other techniques such as atomic force microscopy, but\ntend to be limited to specific sample environments and/or two-dimensional\nimages. Here, we report investigations into the defect-stability relationship\nof silver nanoparticles to voltage-induced electrochemical dissolution imaged\nin-situ in three-dimensional (3D) detail by Bragg Coherent Diffractive Imaging\n(BCDI). We first determine the average dissolution kinetics by Stationary Probe\nRotating Disk Electrode (SPRDE) in combination with inductively coupled plasma\nmass spectrometry (ICP-MS), which allows real-time in-situ measurement of Ag+\nions formation and the corresponding electrochemical current. We then observe\nthe dissolution and redeposition processes in 3D with BCDI in single\nnanocrystals, providing unique insight about the role of surface strain,\ndefects, and their coupling to the dissolution chemistry. The methods developed\nand the knowledge gained go well beyond a \"simple\" silver electrochemistry and\nare applicable to all electrocatalytic reactions where functional links between\nactivity and stability are controlled by structure and defect dynamics.\n", "  We present the updates of the Galactic O-Star Catalog (GOSC) that we have\nundertaken in the last two years: new spectral types, more objects, additional\ninformation, and coordination with CDS. We also present updates for the\nGalactic O-Star Spectroscopic Survey (GOSSS). A new paper (GOSSS-III) has been\npublished and ~1000 targets have been observed since 2014. Four new setups have\nbeen added to our lineup and for two of them we have already obtained over 100\nspectra: with OSIRIS at the 10.4 m GTC we are observing northern dim stars and\nwith FRODOspec at the 2.0 m Liverpool Telescope we are observing northern\nbright stars. Finally, we also make available new versions of MGB, the spectral\nclassification tool associated with the project, and of the GOSSS grid of\nspectroscopic standards.\n", "  A novel optimization concept for an oscillator with two degrees of freedom is\nproposed. By using specially defined motion ratios, we control the action of\nsprings and dampers to each degree of freedom of the oscillator. If the\npotential action of the springs in one period of vibration, used as the payoff\nfunction for the conservative oscillator, is maximized, then the optimal motion\nratios uncouple vibration modes. The same result holds true for the dissipative\noscillator. The application to optimal design of vehicle suspension is\ndiscussed.\n", "  In vortex-like spin arrangements, multiple spins can combine into emergent\nmultipole moments. Such multipole moments have broken space-inversion and\ntime-reversal symmetries, and can therefore exhibit linear magnetoelectric (ME)\nactivity. Three types of such multipole moments are known: toroidal, monopole,\nand quadrupole moments. So far, however, the ME-activity of these multipole\nmoments has only been established experimentally for the toroidal moment. Here,\nwe propose a magnetic square cupola cluster, in which four corner-sharing\nsquare-coordinated metal-ligand fragments form a noncoplanar buckled structure,\nas a promising structural unit that carries an ME-active multipole moment. We\nsubstantiate this idea by observing clear magnetodielectric signals associated\nwith an antiferroic ME-active magnetic quadrupole order in the real material\nBa(TiO)Cu$_4$(PO$_4$)$_4$. The present result serves as a useful guide for\nexploring and designing new ME-active materials based on vortex-like spin\narrangements.\n", "  The fundamental plane (FP) of galaxies can be recovered in the framework of\n$f(R)$ gravity avoiding the issues related to dark matter to fit the\nobservations. In particular, the power-law version $f(R)\\propto R^n$, resulting\nfrom the existence of Noether symmetries for $f(R)$, is sufficient to implement\nthe approach. In fact, relations between the FP parameters and the corrected\nNewtonian potential, coming from $R^n$, can be found and justified from a\nphysical point of view. Specifically, we analyze the velocity distribution of\nelliptical galaxies and obtain that $r_c$, the scale-length depending on the\ngravitational system properties, is proportional to $r_e$, the galaxy effective\nradius. This fact points out that the gravitational corrections induced by\n$f(R)$ can lead photometry and dynamics of the system. Furthermore, the main\nbyproduct of such an approach is that gravity could work in different ways\ndepending on the scales of self-gravitating systems.\n", "  The deconfinement transition at vanishing chemical potential can be reliably\nstudied by lattice simulations and its general features are by now well known.\nOn the contrary, what happens at finite density is still largely unknown and we\nwill review the results obtained in the last year regarding the dependence, for\nsmall density, of the (pseudo)critical temperature on the baryonic chemical\npotential.\n", "  In this paper we discuss some examples of systems composed of $N$ units,\nwhich exchange a conserved quantity $x$ according to some given stochastic\nrule, from some standard kinetic model of condensed matter physics to the\nkinetic exchange models used for studying the wealth dynamics of social\nsystems. The focus is on the similarity of the equilibrium state of the various\nexamples considered, which all relax toward a canonical Gibbs-Boltzmann\nequilibrium distribution for the quantity $x$, given by a $\\Gamma$-distribution\nwith shape parameter $\\alpha = D/2$, which implicitly defines an effective\ndimension $D$ of the system. We study various systems exploring (continuous)\nvalues of $D$ in the interval $[1,\\infty)$.\n", "  We investigated 10 to 200 nm thick black phosphorus flakes on SiO2/Si and\npolyimide substrates by Angle-resolved Polarized Raman spectra (ARPRS) using\n442 nm excitation wavelength. The results revealed that ARPRS with 442 nm\nexcitation can provide unambiguous, convenient, non-destructive and fast\ndetermination of BP's crystallographic orientation. The substrate and thickness\ndependencies of Raman spectra and Raman tensor elements were studied. These\ndependencies were shown to be influenced by Raman excitation laser heating\neffect. By comparing with in-situ Raman measurements at elevated temperatures,\nwe were able to quantify the laser-heating effect, which is significant and\nhard to avoid for Raman measurements of BP on polyimide substrates due to the\npoor thermal conductivity of the substrate. Thermal processing by substrate\nheating was shown to have a significant impact on BP on SiO2/Si substrate, but\nnot for BP on polyimide due to smaller thermal expansion mismatch. Our results\ngive important insights on Raman Spectroscopy characterizations of BP on\ndifferent substrates.\n", "  We investigate the possibility of observing a magneto-transverse scattering\nof photons from alkaline-earth-like atoms as well as alkali-like ions and\nprovide orders of magnitude. The transverse magneto-scattering is physically\ninduced by the interference between two possible quantum transitions of an\nouter electron in a S-state, one dispersive electric-dipole transition to a\nP-orbital state and a second resonant electric-quadrupole transition to a\nP-orbital state. In contrast with previous mechanisms proposed for such an\natomic photonic Hall effect, no real photons are scattered by the\nelectric-dipole allowed transition, which increases the ratio of Hall current\nto background photons significantly. The main experimental challenge is to\novercome the small detection threshold, with only 10^{-5} photons scattered per\natom per second.\n", "  The classical dynamics of a cold atom trapped inside a vertical rotating\nhelical optical tube (HOT) is investigated by taking also into account the\ngravitational field. The resulting equations of motion are solved numerically.\nThe rotation induces a vertical motion for an atom initially at rest. The\nmotion is a result of the action of two inertial forces, namely the centrifugal\nforce and the Coriolis force. Both inertial forces force the atom to rotate in\na direction opposite to that of the angular velocity of the HOT. The frequency\nand the turning points of the atom's global oscillation can be controlled by\nthe value and the direction of the angular velocity of the HOT. However, at\nlarge values of the angular velocity of the HOT the atom can escape from the\nglobal oscillation and be transported along the axis of the HOT. In this case,\nthe rotating HOT operates as an Optical Archimedes' Screw (OAS) for atoms.\n", "  Rhythmic and sequential segmentation of the embryonic body plan is a vital\ndevelopmental patterning process in all vertebrate species. However, a\ntheoretical framework capturing the emergence of dynamic patterns of gene\nexpression from the interplay of cell oscillations with tissue elongation and\nshortening and with signaling gradients, is still missing. Here we show that a\nset of coupled genetic oscillators in an elongating tissue that is regulated by\ndiffusing and advected signaling molecules can account for segmentation as a\nself-organized patterning process. This system can form a finite number of\nsegments and the dynamics of segmentation and the total number of segments\nformed depend strongly on kinetic parameters describing tissue elongation and\nsignaling molecules. The model accounts for existing experimental perturbations\nto signaling gradients, and makes testable predictions about novel\nperturbations. The variety of different patterns formed in our model can\naccount for the variability of segmentation between different animal species.\n", "  Double field theory and exceptional field theory are formulations of\nsupergravity that make certain dualities manifest symmetries of the action. To\nachieve this, the geometry is extended by including dual coordinates\ncorresponding to winding modes of the fundamental objects. This geometrically\nunifies the spacetime metric and the gauge fields (and their local symmetries)\nin a generalized geometry. Solutions to these extended field theories take the\nsimple form of waves and monopoles in the extended space. From a supergravity\npoint of view they appear as 1/2 BPS objects such as the string, the membrane\nand the fivebrane in ordinary spacetime. In this thesis double field theory and\nexceptional field theory are introduced, solutions to their equations of motion\nare constructed and their properties are analyzed. Further it is established\nhow isometries in the extended space give rise to duality relations between the\nsupergravity solutions. Extensions to these core ideas include studying\nGoldstone modes, probing singularities at the core of solutions and localizing\nthem in winding space. The relation of exceptional field theory to F-theory is\nalso covered providing an action for the latter and incorporating the duality\nbetween M-theory and F-theory.\n", "  Stars of stellar type later than about M3.5 are believed to be fully\nconvective and therefore unable to support magnetic dynamos like the one that\nproduces the 11-year solar cycle. Because of their intrinsic faintness, very\nfew late M stars have undergone long-term monitoring to test this prediction,\nwhich is critical to our understanding of magnetic field generation in such\nstars. Magnetic activity is also of interest as the driver of UV and X-ray\nradiation, as well as energetic particles and stellar winds, that affect the\natmospheres of close-in planets that lie within habitable zones, such as the\nrecently discovered Proxima b. We report here on several years of optical, UV,\nand X-ray observations of Proxima Centauri (GJ 551; dM5.5e): 15 years of ASAS\nphotometry in the V band (1085 nights) and 3 years in the I band (196 nights),\n4 years of Swift XRT and UVOT observations (more than 120 exposures), and 9\nsets of X-ray observations from other X-ray missions (ASCA, XMM-Newton, and\nthree Chandra instruments) spanning 22 years. We confirm previous reports of an\n83-day rotational period and find strong evidence for a 7-year stellar cycle,\nalong with indications of differential rotation at about the solar level.\nX-ray/UV intensity is anti-correlated with optical V-band brightness for both\nrotational and cyclical variations. From comparison with other stars observed\nto have X-ray cycles we deduce a simple empirical relationship between X-ray\ncyclic modulation and Rossby number, and we also present Swift UV grism spectra\ncovering 2300-6000 {\\AA}.\n", "  From the principle of least action the equation of motion for viscous\ncompressible and charged fluid is derived. The viscosity effect is described by\nthe 4-potential of the energy dissipation field, dissipation tensor and\ndissipation stress-energy tensor. In the weak field limit it is shown that the\nobtained equation is equivalent to the Navier-Stokes equation. The equation for\nthe power of the kinetic energy loss is provided, the equation of motion is\nintegrated, and the dependence of the velocity magnitude is determined. A\ncomplete set of equations is presented, which suffices to solve the problem of\nmotion of viscous compressible and charged fluid in the gravitational and\nelectromagnetic fields.\n", "  Empirical relationships are derived for the expected sampling error of\nquantile estimations using Monte Carlo experiments for two frequency\ndistributions frequently encountered in climate sciences. The relationships\nfound are expressed as a scaling factor times the standard error of the mean;\nthese give a quick tool to estimate the uncertainty of quantiles for a given\nfinite sample size.\n", "  Lumley [Lumley J.L.: Adv. Appl. Mech. 18 (1978) 123--176] provided a\ngeometrical proof that any Reynolds-stress tensor $\\overline{u_i'u_j'}$ (indeed\nany tensor whose eigenvalues are invariably nonnegative) should remain inside\nthe so-called Lumley's realizability triangle. An alternative formal algebraic\nproof is given that the anisotropy invariants of any positive-definite\nsymmetric Cartesian rank-2 tensor in the 3-D Euclidian space $\\mathbb{E}^3$\ndefine a point which lies within the realizability triangle. This general\nresult applies therefore not only to $\\overline{u_i'u_j'}$ but also to many\nother tensors that appear in the analysis and modeling of turbulent flows.\nTypical examples are presented based on DNS data for plane channel flow.\n", "  In atomic force microscopy (AFM), the exchange and alignment of the AFM\ncantilever with respect to the optical beam and position-sensitive detector\n(PSD) are often performed manually. This process is tedious and time-consuming\nand sometimes damages the cantilever or tip. To increase the throughput of AFM\nin industrial applications, the ability to automatically exchange and align the\ncantilever in a very short time with sufficient accuracy is required. In this\npaper, we present the development of an automated cantilever exchange and\noptical alignment instrument. We present an experimental proof of principle by\nexchanging various types of AFM cantilevers in 6 seconds with an accuracy\nbetter than 2 um. The exchange and alignment unit is miniaturized to allow for\nintegration in a parallel AFM. The reliability of the demonstrator has also\nbeen evaluated. Ten thousand continuous exchange and alignment cycles were\nperformed without failure. The automated exchange and alignment of the AFM\ncantilever overcome a large hurdle toward bringing AFM into high-volume\nmanufacturing and industrial applications.\n", "  For the first time accurate measurements of electron and positron fluxes in\nthe energy range 0.2-10 GeV have been performed with the Alpha Magnetic\nSpectometer (AMS) instrument at altitudes of 370-390 Km in the geographic\nlatitude interval +/- 51.7 deg. We present an original analysis of the AMS\ndata, focused on the study of the under-cutoff component of these fluxes,\noutside the region of the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA). A separation in\nquasi-trapped, long lifetime (O(10 s)), and albedo, short life time (O(100\nms)), components is found. The flux maps as a function of the canonical\nadiabatic variables L, alpha0 are determined in the interval\n(L,alpha0)=(0.95-3,0-90) for electrons with E less than 10 GeV, and positrons\nwith E less than 3 GeV. The results are compared with existing data at lower\nenergies and in similar L, alpha0 range. The properties of the observed\nunder-cutoff particles are also investigated in terms of their residence times\nand geographical origin. The resulting distributions are discussed and related\nto the characteristics of the drift shells observed by AMS.\n", "  A modified version of the Moller-Plesset approach for obtaining the\ncorrelation energy associated to a Hartree-Fock ground state is proposed. The\nmethod is tested in a model of interacting fermions that allows for an exact\nsolution. Using up to third order terms improved results are obtained, even\nmore accurate in the limit of loosely bound particles. This result suggests the\npossible convenience of the scheme for the study of chemical bound problems.\n"]}
