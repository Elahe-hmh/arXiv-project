In this article we introduce an event-level, particle-based\npileup correction procedure, SoftKiller. It removes the softest particles in an\nevent, up to a transverse momentum threshold that is determined dynamically on\nan event-by-event basis. In simulations, this simple procedure appears to be\nreasonably robust and brings superior jet resolution performance compared to\nexisting jet-based approaches. It is also nearly two orders of magnitude faster\nthan methods based on jet areas.\n", "  Charge transfer plays the central role in chemisorption and chemical\nreactions at metal surfaces. The Somorjai group in Nano. Lett. {\\bf 9}, 3930\n(2009) has reported a chemicurrent, a flux of charge carriers in response to\n$\\mathrm{H_2}$ oxidation by $\\mathrm{O_2}$ into $\\mathrm{H_2O}$ over a platinum\nsurface. The nature of the chemicurrent has been debated in the literature;\nexplanations both extrinsic and intrinsic to the reaction mechanism have been\noffered. This article suggests a picture behind the chemicurrent experiments,\nwhich is intrinsic to the mechanism of hydrogen oxidation in a high temperature\nregime. Surface reaction intermediates, $\"\\mathrm{O^-}\"$, $\"\\mathrm{H^-}\"$,\n$\"\\mathrm{OH^-}\"$, are negatively charged while the product, $\\mathrm{H_2O}$,\nand reactants, $\\mathrm{H_2}$ and $\\mathrm{O_2}$, are neutral. Hence, charge\ntransfers between the metal and reacting species are inevitable. After\nelectrons are transferred from the metal to the interface in dissociative\noxygen and hydrogen adsorption, translationally excited electrons in the metal\narise in part as a result of decay of negatively charged transition states in\nreaction steps connecting surface species of different charges,\n$\"\\mathrm{O^-+H^-}\" \\rightleftarrows \"\\mathrm{2 e+OH^-}\"$ and\n$\"\\mathrm{OH^-+H^-}\"\\rightleftarrows \"\\mathrm{2 e+H_2O}\"$. These transition\nstates are the lowest energy configurations possible for changing the charge of\nthe negatively charged surface intermediates. In particular, the transition\nstate for $\"\\mathrm{O^-+H^-}\" \\rightleftarrows \\mathrm{\"2 e+OH^-\"}$ limits the\nreaction rate. These processes may contribute to the chemicurrent. This picture\nshould also apply to other catalytic chemical reactions on metal surfaces that\nproceed through formation of charged surface intermediates and their consequent\ndischarge into the metal.\n", "  According to Zipf's meaning-frequency law, words that are more frequent tend\nto have more meanings. Here it is shown that a linear dependency between the\nfrequency of a form and its number of meanings is found in a family of models\nof Zipf's law for word frequencies. This is evidence for a weak version of the\nmeaning-frequency law. Interestingly, that weak law (a) is not an inevitable of\nproperty of the assumptions of the family and (b) is found at least in the\nnarrow regime where those models exhibit Zipf's law for word frequencies.\n", "  In Aligned Natural Inflation, an alignment between different potential terms\nproduces an inflaton excursion greater than the axion scales in the potential.\nWe show that, starting from a general potential of two axions with two aligned\npotential terms, the effective theory for the resulting light direction is\ncharacterized by four parameters: an effective potential scale, an effective\naxion constant, and two extra parameters (related to ratios of the axion scales\nand the potential scales in the $2-$field theory). For all choices of these\nextra parameters, the model can support inflation along valleys (in the\n$2-$field space) that end in minima of the potential. This leads to a\nphenomenology similar to that of single field Natural Inflation. For a\nsignificant range of the extra two parameters, the model possesses also higher\naltitude inflationary trajectories passing through saddle points of the\n$2-$field potential, and disconnected from any minimum. These plateaus end when\nthe heavier direction becomes unstable, and therefore all of inflation takes\nplace close to the saddle point, where - due to the higher altitude - the\npotential is flatter (smaller $\\epsilon$ parameter). As a consequence, a\ntensor-to-scalar ratio $r = {\\rm O } \\left( 10^{-4} - 10^{-2} \\right)$ can be\neasily achieved in the allowed $n_s$ region, well within the latest $1 \\sigma$\nCMB contours.\n", "  We propose that, up to invertible topological orders, 2+1D fermionic\ntopological orders without symmetry and 2+1D fermionic/bosonic topological\norders with symmetry $G$ are classified by non-degenerate unitary braided\nfusion categories (UBFC) over a symmetric fusion category (SFC); the SFC\ndescribes a fermionic product state without symmetry or a fermionic/bosonic\nproduct state with symmetry $G$, and the UBFC has a modular extension. We\ndeveloped a simplified theory of non-degenerate UBFC over a SFC based on the\nfusion coefficients $N^{ij}_k$ and spins $s_i$. This allows us to obtain a list\nthat contains all 2+1D fermionic topological orders (without symmetry). We find\nexplicit realizations for all the fermionic topological orders in the table.\nFor example, we find that, up to invertible\n$p+\\hspace{1pt}\\mathrm{i}\\hspace{1pt} p$ fermionic topological orders, there\nare only four fermionic topological orders with one non-trivial topological\nexcitation: (1) the $K={\\scriptsize \\begin{pmatrix} -1&0\\\\0&2\\end{pmatrix}}$\nfractional quantum Hall state, (2) a Fibonacci bosonic topological order\n$2^B_{14/5}$ stacking with a fermionic product state, (3) the time-reversal\nconjugate of the previous one, (4) a primitive fermionic topological order that\nhas a chiral central charge $c=\\frac14$, whose only topological excitation has\na non-abelian statistics with a spin $s=\\frac14$ and a quantum dimension\n$d=1+\\sqrt{2}$. We also proposed a categorical way to classify 2+1D invertible\nfermionic topological orders using modular extensions.\n", "  We obtain solutions of Einstein's equations describing gravitational field\noutside a noncanonical global monopole with cosmological constant. In\nparticular, we consider two models of k-monopoles: the Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI)\nand the power-law types, and study their corresponding exterior gravitational\nfields. For each model we found two types of solutions. The first of which are\nglobal k-monopole black hole with conical global topology. These are\ngeneralizations of the Barriola-Vilenkin solution of global monopole. The\nappearance of noncanonical kinetic terms does not modify the critical\nsymmetry-breaking scale, $\\eta_{crit}$, but it does affect the corresponding\nhorizon(s). The second type of solution is compactification, whose topology is\na product of two $2$-dimensional spaces with constant curvatures; ${\\mathcal\nY}_4\\rightarrow {\\mathcal Z}_2\\times S^2$, with ${\\mathcal Y}, {\\mathcal Z}$\ncan be de Sitter, Minkowski, or Anti-de Sitter, and $S^2$ is the $2$-sphere. We\ninvestigate all possible compactifications and show that the nonlinearity of\nkinetic terms opens up new channels which are otherwise non-existent. For\n$\\Lambda=0$ four-dimensional geometry, we conjecture that these\ncompactification channels are their (possible) non-static super-critical\nstates, right before they undergo topological inflation.\n", "  We numerically investigate the expansion of clouds of hard-core bosons in the\ntwo-dimensional square lattice using a matrix-product-state based method. This\nnonequilibrium set-up is induced by quenching the trapping potential to zero\nand our work is specifically motivated by a recent experiment with interacting\nbosons in an optical lattice [Ronzheimer et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 110, 205301\n(2013)]. As the anisotropy of the amplitudes $J_x$ and $J_y$ for hopping in\ndifferent spatial directions is varied from the one- to the two-dimensional\ncase, we observe a crossover from a fast ballistic expansion in the\none-dimensional limit $J_x \\gg J_y$ to much slower dynamics in the isotropic\ntwo-dimensional limit $J_x=J_y$. We further study the dynamics on multi-leg\nladders and long cylinders. For these geometries we compare the expansion of a\ncloud to the melting of a domain wall, which helps us to identify several\ndifferent regimes of the expansion as a function of time. By studying the\ndependence of expansion velocities on both the anisotropy $J_y/J_x$ and the\nnumber of legs, we observe that the expansion on two-leg ladders, while similar\nto the two-dimensional case, is slower than on wider ladders. We provide a\nqualitative explanation for this observation based on an analysis of the rung\nspectrum.\n", "  Peculiarities of the formation of a neutron enhanced standing wave in the\nstructure with a thin highly absorbing layer of gadolinium are considered in\nthe article. An analogue of the poisoning effect well known in reactor physics\nwas found. The effect is stronger for the Nb/Gd/Nb system. Despite of this\neffect, for a Nb/Gd bilayer and a Nb/Gd/Nb trilayer placed between Al2O3\nsubstrate and Cu layer, it is shown theoretically and experimentally that one\norder of magnitude enhancement of neutron density is possible in the vicinity\nof the Gd layer. This enhancement makes it possible to study domain formation\nin the Gd layer under transition of the Nb layer(s) into the superconducting\nstate (cryptoferromagnetic phase).\n", "  We study the impact of the wetting properties on the immiscible displacement\nof a viscous fluid in disordered porous media. We present a novel pore-scale\nmodel that captures wettability and dynamic effects, including the\nspatiotemporal nonlocality associated with interface readjustments. Our\nsimulations show that increasing the wettability of the invading fluid (the\ncontact angle) promotes cooperative pore filling that stabilizes the invasion,\nand that this effect is suppressed as the flow rate increases, due to viscous\ninstabilities. We use scaling analysis to derive two dimensionless numbers that\npredict the mode of displacement. By elucidating the underlying mechanisms, we\nexplain classical yet intriguing experimental observations. These insights\ncould be used to improve technologies such as hydraulic fracturing, CO$_{2}$\ngeo-sequestration, and microfluidics.\n", "  This paper studies the bond valence method (BVM) and its application in the\nnon-isovalent semiconductor alloy (GaN)$_{\\rm{1-x}}$(ZnO)$_{\\rm{x}}$.\nParticular attention is paid to the role of short-range order (SRO). A physical\ninterpretation based on atomic orbital interaction is proposed and examined by\ndensity-functional theory (DFT) calculations. Combining BVM with Monte-Carlo\nsimulations and a DFT-based cluster expansion model, bond-length distributions\nand bond-angle variations are predicted. The correlation between bond valence\nand bond stiffness is also revealed. Finally the concept of bond valence is\nextended into the modelling of an atomistic potential.\n", "  A generalization of the MIT bag boundary condition for spinor matter is\nproposed basing on the requirement that the Dirac hamiltonian operator be\nself-adjoint. An influence of a background magnetic field on the vacuum of\ncharged spinor matter confined between two parallel material plates is studied.\nEmploying the most general set of boundary conditions at the plates in the case\nof the uniform magnetic field directed orthogonally to the plates, we find the\npressure from the vacuum onto the plates. In physically plausible situations,\nthe Casimir effect is shown to be repulsive, independently of a choice of\nboundary conditions and of a distance between the plates.\n", "  We use the vector model of spinning particle to analyze the influence of\nspin-field coupling on the particle's trajectory in ultra-relativistic regime.\nThe Lagrangian with minimal spin-gravity interaction yields the equations\nequivalent to the Mathisson-Papapetrou-Tulczyjew-Dixon (MPTD) equations of a\nrotating body. We show that they have unsatisfactory behavior in the\nultra-relativistic limit. In particular, three-dimensional acceleration of the\nparticle increases with velocity and becomes infinite in the ultra-relativistic\nlimit. The reason is that in the equation for trajectory emerges the term which\ncan be thought as an effective metric generated by the minimal spin-gravity\ncoupling. Therefore we examine the non-minimal interaction through the\ngravimagnetic moment $\\kappa$, and show that the theory with $\\kappa=1$ is free\nof the problems detected in MPTD-equations. Hence the non-minimally interacting\ntheory seem more promising candidate for description of a relativistic rotating\nbody in general relativity.\n  The Lagrangian for the particle in an arbitrary electromagnetic field in\nMinkowski space leads to generalized Frenkel and Bargmann-Michel-Telegdi\nequations. The particle with magnetic moment in electromagnetic field and the\nparticle with gravimagnetic moment in gravitational field have very similar\nstructure of equations of motion. In particular, the spin-electromagnetic\ncoupling also produces an effective metric for the particle with anomalous\nmagnetic moment. If we use the usual special-relativity notions for time and\ndistance, then the critical speed, which the particle cannot exceed during its\nevolution in electromagnetic field, is different from the speed of light. This\ncan be corrected assuming that the three-dimensional geometry should be defined\nwith respect to the effective metric.\n", "  Single-crystal diamond cavity optomechanical devices are a promising example\nof a hybrid quantum system: by coupling mechanical resonances to both light and\nelectron spins, they can enable new ways for photons to control solid state\nqubits. However, realizing cavity optomechanical devices from high quality\ndiamond chips has been an outstanding challenge. Here we demonstrate\nsingle-crystal diamond cavity optomechanical devices that can enable\nphoton-phonon-spin coupling. Cavity optomechanical coupling to $2\\,\\text{GHz}$\nfrequency ($f_\\text{m}$) mechanical resonances is observed. In room temperature\nambient conditions, these resonances have a record combination of low\ndissipation (mechanical quality factor, $Q_\\text{m} > 9000$) and high\nfrequency, with $Q_\\text{m}\\cdot f_\\text{m} \\sim 1.9\\times10^{13}$ sufficient\nfor room temperature single phonon coherence. The system exhibits high optical\nquality factor ($Q_\\text{o} > 10^4$) resonances at infrared and visible\nwavelengths, is nearly sideband resolved, and exhibits optomechanical\ncooperativity $C\\sim 3$. The devices' potential for optomechanical control of\ndiamond electron spins is demonstrated through radiation pressure excitation of\nmechanical self-oscillations whose 31 pm amplitude is predicted to provide 0.6\nMHz coupling rates to diamond nitrogen vacancy center ground state transitions\n(6 Hz / phonon), and $\\sim10^5$ stronger coupling rates to excited state\ntransitions.\n", "  In our previous paper [1], we studied a model of dark matter (DM) in which\nthe hidden sector interacts with standard model particles via a hidden photonic\nportal (HP). We investigated the effects of this new interaction on the\nhydrogen atom and obtained an upper bound for the coupling of the model. In\nthis work, we study the effects of HP on two interesting exotic atoms namely\nmuonium and positronium. We obtain a tighter upper limit on the coupling. We\nalso calculate the change (shift) in the Aharonov-Bohm phase due to HP and find\nthat the phase shift is negligibly small (for DM particles mass in the GeV\nrange). Recently a 3.5 keV X ray line signal observed in the spectrum of 73\ngalaxy clusters, reported by the XXM-Newton X ray observatory. Since in HP\nmodel the DM particles can decay directly into photons, so we finally calculate\nthe value of the coupling constant f using the condition Delta E=3.5 keV.\n", "  We present a model of the electronic properties of monolayer transition-metal\ndichalcogenides based on a tight binding approach which includes the effects of\nstrain and curvature of the crystal lattice. Mechanical deformations of the\nlattice offer a powerful route for tuning the electronic structure of the\ntransition-metal dichalcogenides, as changes to bond lengths lead directly to\ncorrections in the electronic Hamiltonian while curvature of the crystal\nlattice mixes the orbital structure of the electronic Bloch bands. We first\npresent an effective low energy Hamiltonian describing the electronic\nproperties near the K point in the Brillouin zone, then present the corrections\nto this Hamiltonian due to arbitrary mechanical deformations and curvature in a\nway which treats both effects on an equal footing. This analysis finds that\nlocal area variations of the lattice allow for tuning of the band gap and\neffective masses, while the application of uniaxial strain decreases the\nmagnitude of the direct band gap at the K point. Additionally, strain induced\nbond length modifications create a fictitious gauge field with a coupling\nstrength that is smaller than that seen in related materials like graphene. We\nalso find that curvature of the lattice leads to the appearance of both an\neffective in-plane magnetic field which couples to spin degrees of freedom and\na Rashba-like spin-orbit coupling due to broken mirror inversion symmetry.\n", "  The alignment of the CMB Cold Spot and the Eridanus supervoid suggests a\nphysical connection between these two relatively rare objects. We use galaxy\ncata\\-logues with photometric (2MPZ) and spectroscopic (6dF) redshift\nmeasurements, supplemented by low-redshift compilations of cosmic voids, in\norder to improve the 3D mapping of the matter density in the Eridanus\nconstellation. We find evidence for a supervoid with a significant elongation\nin the line-of-sight, effectively spanning the total redshift range $z<0.3$.\nOur tomographic imaging reveals important substructure in the Eridanus\nsupervoid, with a potential interpretation of a long, fully connected system of\nvoids. We improve the analysis by extending the line-of-sight measurements into\nthe antipodal direction that interestingly crosses the Northern Local Supervoid\nat the lowest redshifts. Then it intersects very rich superclusters like\nHercules and Corona Borealis, in the region of the Coma and Sloan Great Walls,\nas a possible compensation for the large-scale matter deficit of Eridanus. We\nfind that large-scale structure measurements are consistent with a central\nmatter underdensity $\\delta_0 \\approx -0.25$, projected transverse radius\n$r_{0}^{\\perp}\\approx 195$ Mpc/h with an extra deepening in the centre, and\nline-of-sight radius $r_{0}^{\\parallel}\\approx500$ Mpc/h, i.e. an ellipsoidal\nsupervoid. The expected integrated Sachs-Wolfe imprint of such an elongated\nsupervoid is at the $\\Delta T_{\\rm ISW} \\approx -40 \\mu K$ level, thus\ninappropriate to accounting for the Cold Spot pattern in the CMB.\n", "  Axions play a central role in many realizations of large field models of\ninflation and in recent alternative mechanisms for generating primordial tensor\nmodes in small field models. If these axions couple to gauge fields, the\ncoupling produces a tachyonic instability that leads to an exponential\nenhancement of the gauge fields, which in turn can decay into observable scalar\nor tensor curvature perturbations. Thus, a fully self-consistent treatment of\naxions during inflation is important, and in this work we discuss the\nperturbative constraints on axions coupled to gauge fields. We show how the\nrecent proposal of generating tensor modes through these alternative mechanisms\nis in tension with perturbation theory in the in-in formalism. Interestingly,\nwe point out that the constraints are parametrically weaker than one would\nestimate based on naive power counting of propagators of the gauge field. In\nthe case of non-Abelian gauge fields, we derive new constraints on the size of\nthe gauge coupling, which apply also in certain models of natural large field\ninflation, such as alignment mechanisms.\n", "  Multi-parton interactions and color reconnection can produce QGP-like effects\nin small systems, specifically, radial flow-like patterns. For pp collisions\nsimulated with Pythia 8.212, in this work we investigate their effects on\ndifferent observables like event multiplicity, event shapes and transverse\nmomentum distributions.\n", "  We consider heterotic string backgrounds in four-dimensional Minkowski space,\nwhere N=1 supersymmetry is spontaneously broken at a low scale m_{3/2} by a\nstringy Scherk-Schwarz mechanism. We review how the effective gauge couplings\nat 1-loop may evade the \"decompactification problem\", namely the\nproportionality of the gauge threshold corrections, with the large volume of\nthe compact space involved in the supersymmetry breaking.\n", "  This paper presents a new Bayesian model and associated algorithm for depth\nand intensity profiling using full waveforms from time-correlated single-photon\ncounting (TCSPC) measurements in the limit of very low photon counts (i.e.,\ntypically less than 20 photons per pixel). The model represents each Lidar\nwaveform as an unknown constant background level, which is combined in the\npresence of a target, to a known impulse response weighted by the target\nintensity and finally corrupted by Poisson noise. The joint target detection\nand depth imaging problem is expressed as a pixel-wise model selection and\nestimation problem which is solved using Bayesian inference. Prior knowledge\nabout the problem is embedded in a hierarchical model that describes the\ndependence structure between the model parameters while accounting for their\nconstraints. In particular, Markov random fields (MRFs) are used to model the\njoint distribution of the background levels and of the target presence labels,\nwhich are both expected to exhibit significant spatial correlations. An\nadaptive Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm including reversible-jump updates\nis then proposed to compute the Bayesian estimates of interest. This algorithm\nis equipped with a stochastic optimization adaptation mechanism that\nautomatically adjusts the parameters of the MRFs by maximum marginal likelihood\nestimation. Finally, the benefits of the proposed methodology are demonstrated\nthrough a series of experiments using real data.\n", "  We calculate the Drude weight in the superfluid (SF) and the supersolid (SS)\nphases of hard core boson (HCB) model using stochastic series expansion (SSE).\nWe demonstrate from our numerical calculations that the normal phase of HCBs in\ntwo dimensions can be an ideal conductor with dissipationless transport. In two\ndimensions, when the ground state is a SF, the superfluid stiffness drops to\nzero with a Kosterlitz-Thouless type transition at $T_{KT}$. The Drude weight,\nthough is equal to the stiffness below $T_{KT}$, surprisingly stays finite even\nfor temperatures above $T_{KT}$ indicating the non-dissipative transport in the\nnormal state of this system. In contrast to this in a three dimensional SF\nphase, where the superfluid stiffness goes to zero continuously with a second\norder phase transition at $T_c$, Drude weight also goes to zero at $T_c$ as\nexpected. We also calculated the Drude weight in a 2D SS phase, where the\ncharge density wave (CDW) order coexists with superfluidity. For the SS phase\nwe studied, superfluidity is lost via Kosterlitz-Thouless transition at\n$T_{KT}$ and the transition temperature for the CDW order is larger than\n$T_{KT}$. In striped SS phase where the CDW order breaks the rotational\nsymmetry of the lattice, for $T > T_{KT}$, the system behaves like an ideal\nconductor along one of the lattice direction while along the other direction it\nbehaves like an insulator. In contrast to this, in star-SS phase, Drude weight\nalong both the lattice directions goes to zero along with the superfluid\nstiffness and for $T > T_{KT}$ we have a finite temperature phase of a CDW\ninsulator.\n", "  We investigate the effects of material anisotropy on the superheating field\nof layered superconductors. We provide an intuitive argument both for the\nexistence of a superheating field, and its dependence on anisotropy, for\n$\\kappa = \\lambda / \\xi$ (the ratio of magnetic to superconducting healing\nlengths) both large and small. On the one hand, the combination of our\nestimates with published results using a two-gap model for MgB${}_2$ suggests\nhigh anisotropy of the superheating field near zero temperature. On the other\nhand, within Ginzburg-Landau theory for a single gap, we see that the\nsuperheating field shows significant anisotropy only when the crystal\nanisotropy is large and the Ginzburg-Landau parameter $\\kappa$ is small. We\nthen conclude that only small anisotropies in the superheating field are\nexpected for typical unconventional superconductors near the critical\ntemperature. Using a generalized form of Ginzburg Landau theory, we do a\nquantitative calculation for the anisotropic superheating field by mapping the\nproblem to the isotropic case, and present a phase diagram in terms of\nanisotropy and $\\kappa$, showing type I, type II, or mixed behavior (within\nGinzburg-Landau theory), and regions where each asymptotic solution is\nexpected. We estimate anisotropies for a number of different materials, and\ndiscuss the importance of these results for radio-frequency cavities for\nparticle accelerators.\n", "  Time-dependent spin phenomena in condensed matter are most often either\ndescribed in the weakly correlated limit of metallic Stoner/Slater-like\nmagnetism via band theory or in the strongly correlated limit of\nHeisenberg-like interacting spins in an insulator. However many experimental\nstudies, e.g. of (de)magnetization processes, focus on itinerant local-moment\nmaterials such as transition metals and various of their compounds. We here\npresent a general theoretical framework that is capable of addressing\ncorrelated spin dynamics, also in the presence of a vanishing charge gap. A\nreal-space implementation of the time-dependent rotational-invariant slave\nboson methodology allows to treat non-equilibrium spins numerically fast and\nefficiently beyond linear response as well as beyond the band-theoretical or\nHeisenberg limit.\n", "  Electrical power systems are one of the most important infrastructures that\nsupport our society. However, their vulnerabilities have raised great concern\nrecently due to several large-scale blackouts around the world. In this paper,\nwe investigate the robustness of power systems against cascading failures\ninitiated by a random attack. This is done under a simple yet useful model\nbased on global and equal redistribution of load upon failures. We provide a\ncomplete understanding of system robustness by i) deriving an expression for\nthe final system size as a function of the size of initial attacks; ii)\nderiving the critical attack size after which system breaks down completely;\niii) showing that complete system breakdown takes place through a first-order\n(i.e., discontinuous) transition in terms of the attack size; and iv)\nestablishing the optimal load-capacity distribution that maximizes robustness.\nIn particular, we show that robustness is maximized when the difference between\nthe capacity and initial load is the same for all lines; i.e., when all lines\nhave the same redundant space regardless of their initial load. This is in\ncontrast with the intuitive and commonly used setting where capacity of a line\nis a fixed factor of its initial load.\n", "  Electrons transmitted across a ballistic semiconductor junction undergo\nrefraction, analogous to light rays across an optical boundary. A pn junction\ntheoretically provides the equivalent of a negative index medium, enabling\nnovel electron optics such as negative refraction and perfect (Veselago)\nlensing. In graphene, the linear dispersion and zero-gap bandstructure admit\nhighly transparent pn junctions by simple electrostatic gating, which cannot be\nachieved in conventional semiconductors. Moreover ballistic transport over\nmicron length scales at ambient temperature has been realized, providing an\nideal platform to realize a new generation of device based on electron lensing.\nRobust demonstration of these effects, however, has not been forthcoming. Here\nwe employ transverse magnetic focusing to probe propagation across an\nelectrostatically defined graphene junction. We find perfect agreement with the\npredicted Snells law for electrons, including observation of both positive and\nnegative refraction. Resonant transmission across the pn junction provides a\ndirect measurement of the angle dependent transmission coefficient, and we\ndemonstrate good agreement with theory. Comparing experimental data with\nsimulation reveals the crucial role played by the effective junction width,\nproviding guidance for future device design. Our results pave the way for\nrealizing novel electron optics based on graphene pn junctions.\n", "  Doubly special relativity (DSR) is an effective model for encoding quantum\ngravity in flat spacetime. To incorporate DSR into general relativity, one\ncould use \"Gravity's rainbow\", where the spacetime background felt by a test\nparticle would depend on its energy. In this scenario, one could rewrite the\nrainbow metric $g_{\\mu\\nu}\\left( E\\right) $ in terms of some orthonormal frame\nfields and use the modified equivalence principle to determine the energy\ndependence of $g_{\\mu\\nu}\\left( E\\right) $. Obviously, the form of\n$g_{\\mu\\nu}\\left( E\\right) $ depends on the choice of the orthonormal frame.\nFor a static black hole, there are two natural orthonormal frames, the static\none hovering above it and freely falling one along geodesics. The cases with\nthe static orthonormal frame have been extensively studied by many authors. The\naim of this paper is to investigate properties of rainbow black holes in the\nscenario with the free-fall orthonormal frame. We first derive the metric of\nrainbow black holes and their Hawking temperatures in this free-fall scenario.\nThen, the thermodynamics of a rainbow Schwarzschild black hole is studied.\nFinally, we use the brick wall model to compute the thermal entropy of a\nmassless scalar field near the horizon of a Schwarzschild rainbow black hole in\nthis free-fall scenario.\n", "  The $^{120}$Sn($p$,$p\\alpha$)$^{116}$Cd reaction at 392 MeV is investigated\nwith the distorted wave impulse approximation (DWIA) framework. We show that\nthis reaction is very peripheral mainly because of the strong absorption of\n$\\alpha$ by the reaction residue $^{116}$Cd, and the $\\alpha$-clustering on the\nnuclear surface can be probed clearly. We investigate also the validity of the\nso-called factorization approximation that has frequently been used so far. It\nis shown that the kinematics of $\\alpha$ in the nuclear interior region is\nsignificantly affected by the distortion of $^{116}$Cd, but it has no effect on\nthe reaction observables because of the strong absorption in that region.\n", "  Rational design of artificial lattices yields effects unavailable in simple\nsolids, and vertical superlattices of multilayer semiconductors are already\nused in optical sensors and emitters. Manufacturing lateral superlattices\nremains a much bigger challenge, with new opportunities offered by the use of\nmoire patterns in van der Waals heterostructures of graphene and hexagonal\ncrystals such as boron nitride (h-BN). Experiments to date have elucidated the\nnovel electronic structure of highly aligned graphene/h-BN heterostructures,\nwhere miniband edges and saddle points in the electronic dispersion can be\nreached by electrostatic gating. Here we investigate the dynamics of electrons\nin moire minibands by transverse electron focusing, a measurement of ballistic\ntransport between adjacent local contacts in a magnetic field. At low\ntemperatures, we observe caustics of skipping orbits extending over hundreds of\nsuperlattice periods, reversals of the cyclotron revolution for successive\nminibands, and breakdown of cyclotron motion near van Hove singularities. At\nhigh temperatures, we study the suppression of electron focusing by inelastic\nscattering.\n", "  We study coherent transport and bound-state formation of Bogoliubov\nquasiparticles in a high-mobility In$_{0.75}%$Ga$_{0.25}$As two-dimensional\nelectron gas (2DEG) coupled to a superconducting Nb electrode by means of a\nquantum point contact (QPC) as a tunable single-mode probe. Below the\nsuperconducting critical temperature of Nb, the QPC shows a single-channel\nconductance greater than the conductance quantum $2e^{2}/h$ at zero bias, which\nindicates the presence of Andreev-reflected quasiparticles, time-reversed\nstates of the injected electron, returning back through the QPC. The marked\nsensitivity of the conductance enhancement to voltage bias and perpendicular\nmagnetic field suggests a mechanism analogous to reflectionless tunneling--a\nhallmark of phase-coherent transport, with the boundary of the 2DEG cavity\nplaying the role of scatters. When the QPC transmission is reduced to the\ntunneling regime, the differential conductance vs bias voltage probes the\nsingle-particle density of states in the proximity area. Measured conductance\nspectra show a double peak within the superconducting gap of Nb, demonstrating\nthe formation of Andreev bound states in the 2DEG. Both of these results,\nobtained in the open and closed geometries, underpin the coherent nature of\nquasiparticles, i.e., phase-coherent Andreev reflection at the InGaAs/Nb\ninterface and coherent propagation in the ballistic 2DEG.\n", "  We study the decay and oscillations of Majorana fermion wavefunctions and\nground state (GS) fermion parity in one-dimensional topological superconducting\nlattice systems. Using a Majorana transfer matrix method, we find that Majorana\nwavefunction properties are encoded in the associated Lyapunov exponent, which\nin turn is the sum of two independent components: a `superconducting component'\nwhich characterizes the gap induced decay, and the `normal component', which\ndetermines the oscillations and response to chemical potential configurations.\nThe topological phase transition separating phases with and without Majorana\nend modes is seen to be a cancellation of these two components. We show that\nMajorana wavefunction oscillations are completely determined by an underlying\nnon-superconducting tight-binding model and are solely responsible for GS\nfermion parity switches in finite-sized systems. These observations enable us\nto analytically chart out wavefunction oscillations, the resultant GS parity\nconfiguration as a function of parameter space in uniform wires, and special\nparity switch points where degenerate zero energy Majorana modes are restored\nin spite of finite size effects. For disordered wires, we find that band\noscillations are completely washed out leading to a second localization length\nfor the Majorana mode and the remnant oscillations are randomized as per\nAnderson localization physics in normal systems. Our transfer matrix method\nfurther allows us to i) reproduce known results on the scaling of mid-gap\nMajorana states and demonstrate the origin of its log-normal distribution, ii)\nidentify contrasting behavior of disorder-dependent GS parity switches for the\ncases of even versus odd number of lattice sites, and iii) chart out the GS\nparity configuration and associated parity switch points as a function of\ndisorder strength.\n", "  We numerically study the dynamics of entanglement entropy, induced by an\noscillating time periodic driving of the transverse field, h(t), of a\none-dimensional quantum Ising chain. We consider several realizations of h(t),\nand we find a number of results in analogy with entanglement entropy dynamics\ninduced by a sudden quantum quench. After short-time relaxation, the dynamics\nof entanglement entropy synchronises with h(t), displaying an oscillatory\nbehaviour at the frequency of the driving. Synchronisation in the dynamics of\nentanglement entropy, is spoiled by the appearance of quasi-revivals which fade\nout in the thermodynamic limit, and which we interpret using a quasi-particle\npicture adapted to periodic drivings. Taking the time-average of the\nentanglement entropy in the synchronised regime, we find that it obeys a volume\nlaw scaling with the subsystem's size. Such result is reminiscent of a thermal\nstate or of a Generalised Gibbs ensemble of a quenched Ising chain, although\nthe system does not heat up towards infinite temperature as a consequence of\nthe integrability of the model.\n", "  In inflation with nonminimal derivative coupling there is not a conformal\ntransformation to the Einstein frame where calculations are straightforward,\nand thus in order to extract inflationary observables one needs to perform a\ndetailed and lengthy perturbation investigation. In this work we bypass this\nproblem by performing a Hamilton-Jacobi analysis, namely rewriting the\ncosmological equations considering the scalar field to be the time variable. We\napply the method to two specific models, namely the power-law and the\nexponential cases, and for each model we calculate various observables such as\nthe tensor-to-scalar ratio, and the spectral index and its running. We compare\nthem with 2013 and 2015 Planck data, and we show that they are in a very good\nagreement with observations.\n", "  Direct measurements of spin fluctuations are becoming the mainstream approach\nfor studies of complex condensed matter, molecular, nuclear, and atomic\nsystems. This review covers recent progress in the field of optical Spin Noise\nSpectroscopy (SNS) with an additional goal to establish an introduction into\nits theoretical foundations. Various theoretical techniques that have been\nrecently used to interpret results of SNS measurements are explained alongside\nwith examples of their applications.\n", "  In a recent theoretical article [Eur. Phys. J. D 70, 1 (2016)], Kazemi et al.\nclaim to have demonstrated superluminal light transmission in an optomechanical\nsystem where a Bose-Einstein condensate serves as the mechanical oscillator. In\nfact the superluminal propagation is only inferred from the existence of a\nminimum of transmission of the system at the probe frequency. This condition is\nnot sufficient and we show that, in all the cases where superluminal\npropagation is claimed by Kazemi et al., the propagation is in reality\nsubluminal. Moreover, we point out that the system under consideration is not\nminimum-phase-shift. The Kramers-Kronig relations then only fix a lower limit\nto the group delay and we show that these two quantities have sometimes\nopposite signs.\n", "  We develop a Magnus formalism for periodically driven systems which provides\nan expansion both in the driving term and the inverse driving frequency,\napplicable to isolated and dissipative systems. We derive explicit formulas for\na driving term with a cosine dependence on time, up to fourth order. We apply\nthese to the steady state of a classical parametric oscillator coupled to a\nthermal bath, which we solve numerically for comparison. Beyond dynamical\nstabilization at second order, we find that the higher orders further\nrenormalize the oscillator frequency, and additionally create a weakly\nrenormalized effective temperature. The renormalized oscillator frequency is\nquantitatively accurate almost up to the parametric instability, as we confirm\nnumerically. Additionally, a cut-off dependent term is generated, which\nindicates the break-down of the hierarchy of time scales of the system, as a\nprecursor to the instability. Finally, we apply this formalism to a\nparametrically driven chain, as an example for the control of the dispersion of\na many-body system.\n", "  We study the size of the minimal gap between the first N eigenvalues of the\nLaplacian on a rectangular billiard having irrational squared aspect ratio\n$\\alpha$, in comparison to the corresponding quantity for a Poissonian\nsequence. If $\\alpha$ is a quadratic irrationality of certain type, such as the\nsquare root of a rational number, we show that the minimal gap is roughly of\nsize 1/N, which is essentially consistent with Poisson statistics. We also give\nrelated results for a set of $\\alpha$'s of full measure. However, on a fine\nscale we show that Poisson statistics is violated for all $\\alpha$. The proofs\nuse a variety of ideas of an arithmetical nature, involving Diophantine\napproximation, the theory of continued fractions, and results in analytic\nnumber theory.\n", "  The Green's function method has applications in several fields in Physics,\nfrom classical differential equations to quantum many-body problems. In the\nquantum context, Green's functions are correlation functions, from which it is\npossible to extract information from the system under study, such as the\ndensity of states, relaxation times and response functions. Despite its power\nand versatility, it is known as a laborious and sometimes cumbersome method.\nHere we introduce the equilibrium Green's functions and the equation-of-motion\ntechnique, exemplifying the method in discrete lattices of non-interacting\nelectrons. We start with simple models, such as the two-site molecule, the\ninfinite and semi-infinite one-dimensional chains, and the two-dimensional\nladder. Numerical implementations are developed via the recursive Green's\nfunction, implemented in Julia, an open-source, efficient and easy-to-learn\nscientific language. We also present a new variation of the surface recursive\nGreen's function method, which can be of interest when simulating\nsimultaneously the properties of surface and bulk.\n", "  We present results from a new approach to learning and plasticity in\nneuromorphic hardware systems: to enable flexibility in implementable learning\nmechanisms while keeping high efficiency associated with neuromorphic\nimplementations, we combine a general-purpose processor with full-custom analog\nelements.\n  This processor is operating in parallel with a fully parallel neuromorphic\nsystem consisting of an array of synapses connected to analog, continuous time\nneuron circuits. Novel analog correlation sensor circuits process spike events\nfor each synapse in parallel and in real-time.\n  The processor uses this pre-processing to compute new weights possibly using\nadditional information following its program.\n  Therefore, learning rules can be defined in software giving a large degree of\nflexibility.\n  Synapses realize correlation detection geared towards Spike-Timing Dependent\nPlasticity (STDP) as central computational primitive in the analog domain.\n  Operating at a speed-up factor of 1000 compared to biological time-scale, we\nmeasure time-constants from tens to hundreds of micro-seconds.\n  We analyze variability across multiple chips and demonstrate learning using a\nmultiplicative STDP rule.\n  We conclude, that the presented approach will enable flexible and efficient\nlearning as a platform for neuroscientific research and technological\napplications.\n", "  The secret key rate attained by a free-space QKD system in the {\\em\nnear-field} propagation regime (relevant for $1$-$10$ km range using $\\approx\n7$ cm radii transmit and receive apertures and $1.55~\\mu$m transmission center\nwavelenght) can benefit from the use of multiple spatial modes. A suite of\ntheoretical research in recent years have suggested the use of\norbital-angular-momentum (OAM) bearing spatial modes of light to obtain this\nimprovement in rate. We show that most of the aforesaid rate improvement in the\nnear field afforded by spatial-mode multiplexing can be realized by a\nsimple-to-build overlapping Gaussian beam array (OGBA) and a pixelated detector\narray. With the current state-of-the-art in OAM-mode-sorting efficiencies, the\nkey-rate performance of our OGBA architecture could come very close to, if not\nexceed, that of a system employing OAM modes, but at a fraction of the cost.\n", "  In this work, two completely different approaches, statefinder with error\nbars and Bayesian evidence, are used to distinguish and judge three\ntime-dependent dark energy models. The parameters constrain for the three dark\nenergy models are given using the current cosmic observational data sets :\n$Planck$ 2015, SNIa, BAO and OHD. Using the statefinder pairs with error bars,\nwe find that the error region of the dark energy model, whose equation of state\nparameter is given by $w(a) = w_0+w_3\\frac{1-a}{a^2+(1-a)^2}$, is relativity\ncompact than the other two models during the all the evolving history.\nMeanwhile, the Bayesian evidence also provide that this model is significantly\nbetter than the other two models and the other two models are inconclusive.\nThen, there are reasons for believing that this model is a preferential\ncandidate in dark energy investigation rather than the other two.\n", "  Although a considerable number of solvent based methodologies have been\ndeveloped for exfoliating black phosphorus, so far there are no reports on\ncontrolled organization of these exfoliated nanosheets on substrates. Here, for\nthe first time to the best of our knowledge, a mixture of\nN-Methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) and deoxygenated water is employed as a subphase\nin Langmuir Blodgett (LB) trough for assembling the nanosheets followed by\ntheir deposition on substrates and studied its field effect transistor (FET)\ncharacteristics. Electron microscopy reveals the presence of densely aligned,\ncrystalline, ultra-thin sheets of pristine phosphorene having lateral\ndimensions larger than hundred of microns. Furthermore, these assembled\nnanosheets retain their electronic properties and show a high current\nmodulation of 10^4 at room temperature in FET devices. The proposed technique\nprovides semiconducting phosphorene thin films that are amenable for large area\napplications.\n", "  We use the ACTpol published cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization\ndata to constrain cosmological birefringence, a tracer of parity violation\nbeyond the standard model of particle physics. To this purpose, we employ all\nthe polarized ACTpol spectra, including the cross-correlations between\ntemperature anisotropy and B mode polarization (TB) and between E mode and B\nmode (EB), which are most sensitive to the effect. We build specific, so-called\nD-estimators for birefringence and assess their performances and error budgets\nby using realistic Monte Carlo simulations based on the experimental\ncharacteristics provided by the ACTpol collaboration. We determine the optimal\nmultipole range for our analysis to be $250 < \\ell < 3025$ over which we find a\nnull result for the uniform birefringence angle $\\alpha = 0.29^\\circ \\pm\n0.28^\\circ$ (stat.) $\\pm 0.5^\\circ$ (syst.), the latter uncertainty being the\nestimate published by the ACTpol team on their global systematic error budget.\nWe show that this result holds consistently when other multipole ranges are\nconsidered. Finally, we forecast the capability of several forthcoming ground\nbased, balloon and space borne CMB experiments to constrain the birefringence\nangle, showing, e.g., that the proposed post-Planck COrE satellite mission\ncould in principle constrain $\\alpha$ at a level of 10 arcsec, provided that\nall systematics are under control. Under the same circumstances, we find the\nCOrE constraints to be at least 2 or 3 times better than what could ideally be\nachieved by the other experiments considered.\n", "  The quadratic scalar radar equations are obtained for SuperDARN radars that\nare suitable for the analysis and interpretation of experimental data. The\npaper is based on a unified approach to the obtaining radar equations for the\nmonostatic and bistatic sounding with use of hamiltonian optics and ray\nrepresentation of scalar Green's function and without taking into account the\npolarization effects. The radar equation obtained is the sum of several terms\ncorresponding to the propagation and scattering over the different kinds of\ntrajectories, depending on their smoothness and the possibility of reflection\nfrom the ionosphere. It is shown that the monostatic sounding in the media with\nsignificant refraction, unlike the case of refraction-free media, should be\nanalyzed as a combination of monostatic and bistatic scattering. This leads to\nstrong dependence of scattering amplitude on background ionospheric density due\nto focusing mechanism and appearance of new (bistatic) areas of effective\nscattering with significant distortion of the scattered signal spectrum.\nSelective properties of the scattering also have been demonstrated.\n", "  We consider the massive Thirring model at finite density in 0+1 dimension.\nThe fermion bag approach, Langevin dynamics and complex Langevin dynamics are\nadopted to attack the sign problem for this model. Compared with the complex\nLangevin dynamics, both fermion bag approach and Langvin dynamics avoid the\nsign problem. The fermion density and chiral condensate, which are obtained by\nthese numerical methods, are compared with the exact results. The advantages of\nthe fermion bag approach over the other numerical methods are also discussed.\n", "  The entanglement spectrum of the reduced density matrix contains information\nbeyond the von Neumann entropy and provides unique insights into exotic orders\nor critical behavior of quantum systems. Here, we show that strongly disordered\nsystems in the many-body localized phase have power-law entanglement spectra,\narising from the presence of extensively many local integrals of motion. The\npower-law entanglement spectrum distinguishes many-body localized systems from\nergodic systems, as well as from ground states of gapped integrable models or\nfree systems in the vicinity of scale-invariant critical points. We confirm our\nresults using large-scale exact diagonalization. In addition, we develop a\nmatrix-product state algorithm which allows us to access the eigenstates of\nlarge systems close to the localization transition, and discuss general\nimplications of our results for variational studies of highly excited\neigenstates in many-body localized systems.\n", "  Casimir-Polder interaction arises from the vacuum fluctuations of quantum\nfield that depend on spacetime curvature and thus is spacetime-dependent. Here\nwe show how to use the resonance Casimir-Polder interaction (RCPI) between two\nentangled atoms to detect spacetime curvature. We find that the RCPI of two\nstatic entangled atoms in the de Sitter-invariant vacuum depends on the de\nSitter spacetime curvature relevant to the temperature felt by the static\nobserver. It is characterized by a $1/L^2$ power law decay when beyond a\ncharacteristic length scale associated to the breakdown of a local inertial\ndescription of the two-atom system. However, the RCPI of the same setup\nembedded in a thermal bath in the Minkowski universe is temperature-independent\nand is always characterized by a $1/L$ power law decay. Therefore, although a\nsingle static atom in the de Sitter-invariant vacuum responds as if it were\nbathed in thermal radiation in a Minkowski universe, using the distinct\ndifference between RCPI of two entangled atoms one can in principle distinguish\nthese two universes.\n", "  A salient feature of cyclically driven first-order phase transformations in\ncrystals is their scale-free avalanche dynamics. This behavior has been linked\nto the presence of a classical critical point but the mechanism leading to\ncriticality without extrinsic tuning remains unexplained. Here we show that the\nsource of scaling in such systems is an annealed disorder associated with\ntransformation-induced slip which co-evolves with the phase transformation,\nthus ensuring the crossing of a critical manifold. Our conclusions are based on\na model where annealed disorder emerges in the form of a random field induced\nby the phase transition. Such disorder exhibits super-transient chaotic\nbehavior under thermal loading, obeys a heavy-tailed distribution and exhibits\nlong-range spatial correlations. We show that the universality class is\naffected by the long-range character of elastic interactions. In contrast, it\nis not influenced by the heavy-tailed distribution and spatial correlations of\ndisorder.\n", "  Diamond is a promising material for the development of emerging applications\nin quantum optics, quantum information and quantum sensing. The fabrication and\ncharacterization of novel luminescent defects with suitable opto-physical\nproperties is therefore of primary importance for further advances in these\nresearch fields. In this work we report on the investigation in the formation\nof photoluminescent (PL) defects upon MeV He implantation in diamond. Such\ncolor centers, previously reported only in electroluminescence and\ncathodoluminescence regime, exhibited two sharp emission lines at 536.5 nm and\n560.5 nm, without significant phonon sidebands. A strong correlation between\nthe PL intensities of the above-mentioned emission lines and the He\nimplantation fluence was found in the 10^15-10^17 cm^{-2} fluence range. The PL\nemission features were not detected in control samples, i.e. samples that were\neither unirradiated or irradiated with different ion species (H, C). Moreover,\nthe PL emission lines disappeared in samples that were He-implanted above the\ngraphitization threshold. Therefore, the PL features are attributed to\noptically active defects in the diamond matrix associated with He impurities.\nThe intensity of the 536.5 nm and 560.5 nm emission lines was investigated as a\nfunction of the annealing temperature of the diamond substrate. The emission\nwas observed upon annealing at temperatures higher than 500{\\deg}C, at the\nexpenses of the concurrently decreasing neutral-vacancy-related GR1 emission\nintensity. Therefore, our findings indicate that the luminescence originates\nfrom the formation of a stable lattice defect. Finally, the emission was\ninvestigated under different laser excitations wavelengths (i.e. 532 nm and 405\nnm) with the purpose of gaining a preliminary insight about the position of the\nrelated levels in the energy gap of diamond.\n", "  Fourier ptychography (FP) is a recently proposed computational imaging\ntechnique for high space-bandwidth product imaging. In real setups such as\nendoscope and transmission electron microscope, the common sample motion\nlargely degrades the FP reconstruction and limits its practicability. In this\npaper, we propose a novel FP reconstruction method to efficiently correct for\nunknown sample motion. Specifically, we adaptively update the sample's Fourier\nspectrum from low spatial-frequency regions towards high spatial-frequency\nones, with an additional motion recovery and phase-offset compensation\nprocedure for each sub-spectrum. Benefiting from the phase retrieval redundancy\ntheory, the required large overlap between adjacent sub-spectra offers an\naccurate guide for successful motion recovery. Experimental results on both\nsimulated data and real captured data show that the proposed method can correct\nfor unknown sample motion with its standard deviation being up to 10% of the\nfield-of-view scale. We have released our source code for non-commercial use,\nand it may find wide applications in related FP platforms such as endoscopy and\ntransmission electron microscopy.\n", "  Great investments of observing time have been dedicated to the study of\nnearby spiral galaxies with diverse goals ranging from understanding the star\nformation process to characterizing their dark matter distributions. Accurate\ndistances are fundamental to interpreting observations of these galaxies, yet\nmany of the best studied nearby galaxies have distances based on methods with\nrelatively large uncertainties. We have started a program to derive accurate\ndistances to these galaxies. Here we measure the distance to M51 - the\nWhirlpool galaxy - from newly obtained Hubble Space Telescope optical imaging\nusing the tip of the red giant branch method. We measure the distance modulus\nto be 8.58+/-0.10 Mpc (statistical), corresponding to a distance modulus of\n29.67+/-0.02 mag. Our distance is an improvement over previous results as we\nuse a well-calibrated, stable distance indicator, precision photometry in a\noptimally selected field of view, and a Bayesian Maximum Likelihood technique\nthat reduces measurement uncertainties.\n", "  As Physics did in previous centuries, there is currently a common dream of\nextracting generic laws of nature in economics, sociology, neuroscience, by\nfocalising the description of phenomena to a minimal set of variables and\nparameters, linked together by causal equations of evolution whose structure\nmay reveal hidden principles. This requires a huge reduction of dimensionality\n(number of degrees of freedom) and a change in the level of description. Beyond\nthe mere necessity of developing accurate techniques affording this reduction,\nthere is the question of the correspondence between the initial system and the\nreduced one. In this paper, we offer a perspective towards a common framework\nfor discussing and understanding multi-level systems exhibiting structures at\nvarious spatial and temporal levels. We propose a common foundation and\nillustrate it with examples from different fields. We also point out the\ndifficulties in constructing such a general setting and its limitations.\n", "  Nuclear uncertainties in the production of $p$ nuclei in massive stars have\nbeen quantified in a Monte Carlo procedure. Bespoke temperature-dependent\nuncertainties were assigned to different types of reactions involving nuclei\nfrom Fe to Bi. Their simultaneous impact was studied in postprocessing\nexplosive trajectories for three different stellar models. It was found that\nthe grid of mass zones in the model of a 25 $M_\\odot$ star, which is widely\nused for investigations of $p$ nucleosynthesis, is too crude to properly\nresolve the detailed temperature changes required for describing the production\nof $p$ nuclei. Using models with finer grids for 15 $M_\\odot$ and 25 $M_\\odot$\nstars with initial solar metallicity, it was found that most of the production\nuncertainties introduced by nuclear reaction uncertainties are smaller than a\nfactor of two. Since a large number of rates were varied at the same time in\nthe Monte Carlo procedure, possible cancellation effects of several\nuncertainties could be taken into account. Key rates were identified for each\n$p$ nucleus, which provide the dominant contribution to the production\nuncertainty. These key rates were found by examining correlations between rate\nvariations and resulting abundance changes. This method is superior to studying\nflow patterns, especially when the flows are complex, and to individual,\nsequential variation of a few rates.\n", "  Unlike conventional magnets where the magnetic moments are partially or\ncompletely static in the ground state, in a quantum spin liquid they remain in\ncollective motion down to the lowest temperatures. The importance of this state\nis that it is coherent and highly entangled without breaking local symmetries.\nSuch phenomena is usually sought in simple lattices where antiferromagnetic\ninteractions and/or anisotropies that favor specific alignments of the magnetic\nmoments are \"frustrated\" by lattice geometries incompatible with such order\ne.g. triangular structures. Despite an extensive search among such compounds,\nexperimental realizations remain very few. Here we describe the investigation\nof a novel, unexplored magnetic system consisting of strong ferromagnetic and\nweaker antiferromagnetic isotropic interactions as realized by the compound\nCa$_{10}$Cr$_7$O$_{28}$. Despite its exotic structure we show both\nexperimentally and theoretically that it displays all the features expected of\na quantum spin liquid including coherent spin dynamics in the ground state and\nthe complete absence of static magnetism.\n", "  Spectral functions of the nucleon and its negative parity excited state in\nnuclear matter are studied using QCD sum rules and the maximum entropy method\n(MEM). It is found that in-medium modifications of the spectral functions are\nattributed mainly to density dependencies of the $\\langle \\bar{q}q \\rangle $\nand $\\langle q^{\\dagger}q \\rangle $ condensates. The MEM reproduces the\nlowest-energy peaks of both the positive and negative parity nucleon states at\nfinite density up to $\\rho \\sim \\rho_N$ (normal nuclear matter density). As the\ndensity grows, the residue of the nucleon ground state decreases gradually\nwhile the residue of the lowest negative parity excited state increases\nslightly. On the other hand, the positions of the peaks, which correspond to\nthe total energies of these states, are almost density independent for both\nparity states. The density dependencies of the effective masses and vector\nself-energies are also extracted by assuming the mean-field green functions for\nthe peak states. We find that, as the density increases, the nucleon effective\nmass decreases while the vector self-energy increases. The density dependence\nof these quantities for the negative parity state on the other hand turns out\nto be relatively weak.\n", "  We present results of numerical simulations performed on one-dimensional spin\nchains in order to extract the so-called relaxation rate $1/T_1$ accessible\nthrough NMR experiments. Building on numerical tensor network methods using the\nMatrix Product States (MPS) formalism, we can follow the non-trivial crossover\noccurring in critical chains between the high-temperature diffusive classical\nregime and the low-temperature response described by the Tomonaga-Luttinger\nliquid (TLL) theory, for which analytical expressions are known. In order to\ncompare analytics and numerics, we focus on a generic spin-$1/2$ XXZ chain\nwhich is a paradigm of gapless TLL, as well as a more realistic spin-$1$\nanisotropic chain, modelling the DTN material, which can be either in a trivial\ngapped phase or in a TLL regime induced by an external magnetic field. Thus, by\nmonitoring the finite temperature crossover, we provide quantitative limits on\nthe range of validity of TLL theory, that will be useful when interpreting\nexperiments on quasi one-dimensional materials.\n", "  We investigate the sound absorption in quark matter due to the interaction of\nthe sound wave with the precritical fluctuations of the diquark-pair field\nabove $T_c$. The soft collective mode of the pair field is derived using the\ntime dependent Ginzburg-Landau functional with random Langevin forces. The\nstrong absorption near the phase transition line may be viewed as a\nmanifestation of the Mandelshtam-Leontovich slow relaxation time theory.\n", "  Numerical studies by W\\'ojs, Yi and Quinn have suggested that an\nunconventional fractional quantum Hall effect is plausible at filling factors\n$\\nu=$ 1/3 and 1/5, provided the interparticle interaction has an unusual form\nfor which the energy of two fermions in the relative angular momentum three\nchannel dominates. The interaction between composite fermions in the second\n$\\Lambda$ level (composite fermion analog of the electronic Landau level)\nsatisfies this property, and recent studies have supported unconventional\nfractional quantum Hall effect of composite fermions at $\\nu^*=$ 4/3 and 5/3,\nwhich manifests as fractional quantum Hall effect of electrons at $\\nu=$ 4/11,\n4/13, 5/13, and 5/17. I investigate in this article the nature of the\nfractional quantum Hall states at $\\nu=$ 4/5, 5/7, 6/17, and 6/7, which\ncorrespond to composite fermions at $\\nu^*=$ 4/3, 5/3 and 6/5, and find that\nall these fractional quantum Hall states are conventional. The underlying\nreason is that the interaction between composite fermions depends substantially\non both the number and the direction of the vortices attached to the electrons.\nI also study in detail the states with different spin polarizations at 6/17 and\n6/7 and predict the critical Zeeman energies for the spin phase transitions\nbetween them. I calculate the excitation gaps at 4/5, 5/7, 6/7, and 6/17 and\ncompare them against recent experiments.\n", "  In classical Hamiltonian theories, entropy may be understood either as a\nstatistical property of canonical systems, or as a mechanical property, that\nis, as a monotonic function of the phase space along trajectories. In classical\nmechanics, there are theorems which have been proposed for proving the\nnon-existence of entropy in the latter sense. We explicate, clarify and extend\nthe proofs of these theorems to some standard matter (scalar and\nelectromagnetic) field theories in curved spacetime, and then we show why these\nproofs fail in general relativity; due to properties of the gravitational\nHamiltonian and phase space measures, the second law of thermodynamics holds.\nAs a concrete application, we focus on the consequences of these results for\nthe gravitational two-body problem, and in particular, we prove the\nnon-compactness of the phase space of perturbed Schwarzschild-Droste\nspacetimes. We thus identify the lack of recurring orbits in phase space as a\ndistinct sign of dissipation and hence entropy production.\n", "  In highly viscous electron systems such as, for example, high quality\ngraphene above liquid nitrogen temperature, a linear response to applied\nelectric current becomes essentially nonlocal, which can give rise to a number\nof new and counterintuitive phenomena including negative nonlocal resistance\nand current whirlpools. It has also been shown that, although both effects\noriginate from high electron viscosity, a negative voltage drop does not\nprincipally require current backflow. In this work, we study the role of\ngeometry on viscous flow and show that confinement effects and relative\npositions of injector and collector contacts play a pivotal role in the\noccurrence of whirlpools. Certain geometries may exhibit backflow at\narbitrarily small values of the electron viscosity, whereas others require a\nspecific threshold value for whirlpools to emerge.\n", "  We have discovered a new domain of optical coherence, and show that it is the\nthird and last member of a previously unreported fundamental triad of\ncoherences. These are unified by our derivation of a parallel triad of\ncoherence constraints that take the form of complementarity relations. We have\nbeen able to enter this new coherence domain experimentally and we describe the\nnovel tomographic approach devised for that purpose.\n", "  We develop an algorithm to apply the Dalgarno-Lewis (DL) perturbation theory\nto quantum graphs with multiple, connected edges. We use it to calculate the\nnonlinear optical hyperpolarizability tensors for graphs and show that it\nreplicates the sum over states computations, but executes ten to fifty times\nfaster. DL requires only knowledge of the ground state of the graph,\neliminating the requirement to determine all possible degeneracies of a complex\nnetwork. The algorithm is general and may be applied to any quantum graph.\n", "  Pristine single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) are rather inert to O$_2$\nand N$_2$, which for low doses chemisorb only on defect sites or vacancies of\nthe SWCNTs at the ppm level. However, very low doping has a major effect on the\nelectronic properties and conductivity of the SWCNTs. Already at low O$_2$\ndoses (80 L), the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) O 1s signal becomes\nsaturated, indicating nearly all the SWCNT's vacancies have been oxidized. As a\nresult, probing vacancy oxidation on SWCNTs via XPS yields spectra with rather\nlow signal-to-noise ratios, even for metallicity-sorted SWCNTs. We show that,\neven under these conditions, the first principles density functional theory\ncalculated Kohn-Sham O 1s binding energies may be used to assign the XPS O 1s\nspectra for oxidized vacancies on SWCNTs into its individual components. This\nallows one to determine the specific functional groups or bonding environments\nmeasured. We find the XPS O 1s signal is mostly due to three O-containing\nfunctional groups on SWCNT vacancies: epoxy (C$_2$$>$O), carbonyl\n(C$_2$$>$C$=$O), and ketene (C$=$C$=$O), as ordered by abundance. Upon\noxidation of nearly all the SWCNT's vacancies, the central peak's intensity for\nthe metallic SWCNT sample is 60\\% greater than for the semiconducting SWCNT\nsample. This suggests a greater abundance of O-containing defect structures on\nthe metallic SWCNT sample. For both metallic and semiconducting SWCNTs, we find\nO$_2$ does not contribute to the measured XPS O~1s spectra.\n", "  We present an algorithm based on artificial neural networks (ANNs), that\nestimates the mass ratio in a binary black hole collision out of given\nGravitational Wave (GW) strains. In this analysis, the ANN is trained with a\nsample of GW signals generated with numerical simulations. The effectiveness of\nthe algorithm is evaluated with GWs generated also with simulations for given\nmass ratios unknown to the ANN. We measure the accuracy of the algorithm in the\ninterpolation and extrapolation regimes. We present the results for noise free\nsignals and signals contaminated with Gaussian noise, in order to foresee the\ndependence of the method accuracy in terms of the signal to noise ratio.\n", "  The X-ray source 1E 161348-5055 in the supernova remnant RCW 103 recently\nexhibited X-ray activity typical of magnetars, i.e. neutron stars with magnetic\nfields > 10^14-10^15 G. However, 1E 161348-5055 has an observed period of 6.67\nhr, in contrast to magnetars which have a spin period of seconds. Here we\ndescribe a simple model which can explain the spin evolution of 1E 161348-5055,\nas well as other magnetars, from an initial period of milliseconds that would\nbe required for dynamo generation of magnetar-strength magnetic fields. We\npropose that the key difference between 1E 161348-5055 and other magnetars is\nthe persistence of a remnant disk of small total mass. This disk caused 1E\n161348-5055 to undergo ejector and propeller phases in its life, during which\nstrong torques caused a rapid increase of its spin period. By matching its\nobserved spin period and ~1-3 kyr age, we find that 1E 161348-5055 has the\n(slightly) highest magnetic field of all known magnetars, with B~5x10^15 G, and\nthat its disk had a mass of ~10^24 g, comparable to that of the asteroid Ceres.\n", "  An analysis of the kinematics of NGC 6720 is performed on the commissioning\ndata obtained with SITELLE, the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope's new imaging\nFourier transform spectrometer. In order to measure carefully the small\nbroadening effect of a shell expansion on an unresolved emission line, we have\ndetermined a computationally robust implementation of the convolution of a\nGaussian with a sinc instrumental line shape which avoids arithmetic overflows.\nThis model can be used to measure line broadening of typically a few km/s even\nat low spectral resolution (R less than 5000). We have also designed the\ncorresponding set of Gaussian apodizing functions that are now used by ORBS,\nthe SITELLE's reduction pipeline. We have implemented this model in ORCS, a\nfitting engine for SITELLE's data, and used it to derive the [SII] density map\nof the central part of the nebula. The study of the broadening of the [NII]\nlines shows that the Main Ring and the Central Lobe are two different shells\nwith different expansion velocities. We have also derived deep and spatially\nresolved velocity maps of the Halo in [NII] and Halpha and found that the\nbrightest bubbles are originating from two bipolar structures with a velocity\ndifference of more than 35 km/s lying at the poles of a possibly unique Halo\nshell expanding at a velocity of more than 15 km/s.\n", "  In the framework of vector model of spin, we discuss the problem of a\ncovariant formalism \\cite{Pomeranskii1998} concerning the discrepancy between\nrelativistic and Pauli Hamiltonians. We show how the spin-induced non\ncommutativity of a position accounts the discrepancy on the classical level,\nwithout appeal to the Dirac equation and Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation.\n", "  In this paper we employ the results of a previous paper on the late-time\ndecay of scalar-field perturbations of an extreme Reissner-Nordstrom black\nhole, in order to find the late-time decay of coupled electromagnetic and\ngravitational perturbations of this black hole. We explicitly write the\nlate-time tails of Moncrief's gauge invariant variables and of the\nperturbations of the metric tensor and the electromagnetic field tensor in the\nRegge-Wheeler gauge. We discuss some of the consequences of the results and\nrelations to previous works.\n", "  We show that, when a spatially localised electric pulse is applied at the\nedge of a quantum spin Hall system, electron wavepackets of the helical states\ncan be photoexcited by purely intra-branch electrical transitions, without\ninvoking the bulk states or the magnetic Zeeman coupling. In particular, as\nlong as the electric pulse remains applied, the photoexcited densities lose\ntheir character of right- and left-movers, whereas after the ending of the\npulse they propagate in opposite directions without dispersion, i.e.\nmaintaining their space profile unaltered. Notably we find that, while the\nmomentum distribution of the photoexcited wave packets depends on the\ntemperature $T$ and the chemical potential $\\mu$ of the initial equilibrium\nstate and displays a non-linear behavior on the amplitude of the applied pulse,\nin the mesoscopic regime the space profile of the wave packets is independent\nof $T$ and $\\mu$. Instead, it depends purely on the applied electric pulse, in\na linear manner, as a signature of the chiral anomaly characterising massless\nDirac electrons. We also discuss how the photoexcited wave packets can be\ntailored with the electric pulse parameters, for both low and finite\nfrequencies.\n", "  We implement the momentum dissipation introduced by spatial linear axionic\nfields in a holographic model without self-duality, broke by Weyl tensor\ncoupling to Maxwell field, and study its response. It is found that for the\npositive Weyl coupling parameter $\\gamma>0$, the momentum dissipation\ncharacterized by parameter $\\hat{\\alpha}$ drives the boundary conformal field\ntheory (CFT), in which the conductivity exhibits a peak at low frequency, into\nthe incoherent metallic phase with a dip, which is away from CFT due to the\nintroduction of axionic fields. While for $\\gamma<0$, an oppositive scenario is\nfound. Our present model provides a possible route toward the problem that\nwhich sign of $\\gamma$ is the correct description of the CFT of boson Hubbard\nmodel. In addition, we also investigate the DC conductivity, diffusion constant\nand susceptibility. We find that for each of these observables there is a\nspecific value of $\\hat{\\alpha}$, for which these observables are independent\nof $\\gamma$. Finally, the electromagnetic (EM) duality is also studied and we\nfind that there is also a specific value of $\\hat{\\alpha}$, for which the\nparticle-vortex duality related by the change of the sign of $\\gamma$ in the\nboundary theory holds better than for other values of $\\hat{\\alpha}$.\n", "  Radiative double electron capture (RDEC), the one-step process occurring in\nion-atom collisions, has been investigated for bare fluorine ions colliding\nwith carbon. RDEC is completed when two target electrons are captured to a\nbound state of a projectile simultaneously with the emission of a single\nphoton. This work is a follow-up to our earlier measurement of RDEC for bare\noxygen projectiles, thus providing a recipient system free of electron-related\nCoulomb fields in both cases and allowing for the comparison between the two\ncollision systems as well as with available theoretical studies. The most\nsignificant mechanisms of x-ray emission that may contribute to the RDEC energy\nregion as background processes are also addressed.\n", "  Thermal conductivity of the most abundant element in the planetary core, Iron\n(Fe) is measured up to Earth's outer core pressure $\\sim 120$ GPa. The\nmeasurements are carried out using the laser heated diamond anvil cell\nfacility, where the absorbed power by Fe metal foil is calculated using\nthermodynamical equation. The thermal conductivity of $\\gamma-Fe$ linearly\nincreases up to a maximum experimental pressure 40 GPa. Thermal conductivity of\n$\\epsilon-Fe$ measured by us shows a saturated value $\\sim$ 52 ($\\pm$ 5)\n$Wm^{-1}K^{-1}$ in the pressure range 77 - 120 GPa. At different pressures\ntemperature dependence of thermal conductivity show a sharp drop during\nmelting, which indicates the formation of liquid layer resulting in a thermal\nbuffer to the heat conduction.\n", "  The synthesis of heavy, proton rich isotopes in the astrophysical\ngamma-process proceeds through photodisintegration reactions. For the improved\nunderstanding of the process, the rates of the involved nuclear reactions must\nbe known. The reaction 128Ba(g,a)124Xe was found to affect the abundance of the\np nucleus 124Xe. Since the stellar rate for this reaction cannot be determined\nby a measurement directly, the aim of the present work was to measure the cross\nsection of the inverse 124Xe(a,g)128Ba reaction and to compare the results with\nstatistical model predictions. Of great importance is the fact that data below\nthe (a,n) threshold was obtained. Studying simultaneously the 124Xe(a,n)127Ba\nreaction channel at higher energy allowed to further identify the source of a\ndiscrepancy between data and prediction. The 124Xe + alpha cross sections were\nmeasured with the activation method using a thin window 124Xe gas cell. The\nstudied energy range was between E = 11 and 15 MeV close above the\nastrophysically relevant energy range. The obtained cross sections are compared\nwith statistical model calculations. The experimental cross sections are\nsmaller than standard predictions previously used in astrophysical\ncalculations. As dominating source of the difference, the theoretical alpha\nwidth was identified. The experimental data suggest an alpha width lower by at\nleast a factor of 0.125 in the astrophysical energy range. An upper limit for\nthe 128Ba(g,a)124Xe stellar rate was inferred from our measurement. The impact\nof this rate was studied in two different models for core-collapse supernova\nexplosions of 25 solar mass stars. A significant contribution to the 124Xe\nabundance via this reaction path would only be possible when the rate was\nincreased above the previous standard value. Since the experimental data rule\nthis out, they also demonstrate the closure of this production path.\n", "  We present the evolution of a supersonic wind interacting with a Boson Star\n(BS) and compare the resulting wind density profile with that of the shock cone\nformed when the wind is accreted by a non-rotating Black Hole (BH) of the same\nmass. The physical differences between these accretors are that a BS, unlike a\nBH has no horizon, it does not have a mechanical surface either and thus the\nwind is expected to trespass the BS. Despite these conditions, on the BS\nspace-time the gas achieves a stationary flux with the gas accumulating in a\nhigh density elongated structure comparable to the shock cone formed behind a\nBH. The highest density resides in the center of the BS whereas in the case of\nthe BH it is found on the downstream part of the BH near the event horizon. The\nmaximum density of the gas is smaller in the BS than in the BH case. Our\nresults indicate that the highest density of the wind is more similar on the BS\nto that on the BH when the BS has high self-interaction, when it is more\ncompact and when the wind velocity is higher. We expect this and similar\nanalyses help to know whether BSs can still be Black Hole mimickers or can be\nruled out.\n", "  Purpose: To assess the peripheral refraction induced by Fractal Contact\nLenses (FCLs) in myopic eyes by means of a two-dimensional Relative Peripheral\nRefractive Error (RPRE) map.\n  Methods: FCLs prototypes were specially manufactured and characterized. This\nstudy involved twenty-six myopic subjects ranging from -0.50 D to -7.00 D. The\ntwo-dimensional RPRE was measured with an open-field autorefractor by means of\ntracking targets distributed in a square grid from -30 degrees (deg) nasal to\n30 deg temporal and 15 deg superior to -15 deg inferior. Corneal topographies\nwere taken in order to assess correlations between corneal asphericity, lens\ndecentration and RPRE represented in vector components M, J0 and J45.\n  Results: The mean power of the FCLs therapeutic zones was 1.32 +/- 0.28 D.\nSignificant correlations were found between the corneal asphericity and vector\ncomponents of the RPRE in the nacked eyes. FCLs were decentered a mean of 0.7\n+/- 0.19 mm to the temporal cornea. M decreased asymmetrically between nasal\nand temporal retina after fitting the FCLs with a significant increment of the\nmyopic shift besides 10 deg (p<0.05) and the induced myopic shift at 25 deg and\n30 deg decreased with FCLs decentration to temporal cornea. The peak of maximum\nmyopic shift at the peripheral retina (M= -1.3 D) was located at 20 deg.\nTwo-dimensional maps showed uniform significant differences in extreme\npositions of the visual field in comparison with the horizontal RPRE for M and\nJ0, but not for J45.\n  Conclusions: FCLs measured in myopic eyes showed a similar performance than\nthe reported in previous ray-tracing studies with a small bias explained by the\nmanufacturing process and the lens decentration. Two-dimensional maps are\npreferable for assessing J45 changes due to the lens.\n", "  This is the documentation of the tomographic X-ray data of a lotus root,\nfilled with four different attenuating objects, of different sizes. Data are\navailable at www.fips.fi/dataset.php, and can be freely used for scientific\npurposes with appropriate references to them, and to this document in\nhttp://arxiv.org/arXiv. The data set consists of (1) the X-ray sinogram of a\nsingle 2D slice of the lotus root with two different resolutions and (2) the\ncorresponding measurement matrices modeling the linear operation of the X-ray\ntransform. Each of these sinograms was obtained from a measured 360-projection\nfan-beam sinogram by down-sampling and taking logarithms. The original\n(measured) sinogram is also provided in its original form and resolution.\n", "  We present a simple method for the identification of weak signals associated\nwith gravitational wave events. Its application reveals a signal with the same\ntime lag as the GW150914 event in the released LIGO strain data with a\nsignificance around $3.2\\sigma$. This signal starts about 10 minutes before\nGW150914 and lasts for about 45 minutes. Subsequent tests suggest that this\nsignal is likely to be due to external sources.\n", "  Electron bulk energization in the diffusion region during anti-parallel\nsymmetric reconnection entails two stages. First, the inflowing electrons are\nadiabatically trapped and energized by an ambipolar parallel electric field.\nNext, the electrons gain energy from the reconnection electric field as they\nundergo meandering motion. These collisionless mechanisms have been decribed\npreviously, and they lead to highly-structured electron velocity distributions.\nNevertheless, a simplified control-volume analysis gives estimates for how the\nnet effective heating scales with the upstream plasma conditions in agreement\nwith fully kinetic simulations and spacecraft observations.\n", "  We report on the development of Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detectors\n(MKIDs) using platinum silicide as the sensor material. MKIDs are an emerging\nsuperconducting detector technology, capable of measuring the arrival times of\nsingle photons to better than two microseconds and their energies to around ten\npercent. Previously, MKIDs have been fabricated using either sub-stoichiometric\ntitanium nitride or aluminum, but TiN suffers from spatial inhomogeneities in\nthe superconducting critical temperature and Al has a low kinetic inductance\nfraction, causing low detector sensitivity. To address these issues, we have\ninstead fabricated PtSi microresonators with superconducting critical\ntemperatures of 944$\\pm$12~mK and high internal quality factors ($Q_i \\gtrsim\n10^6$). These devices show typical quasiparticle lifetimes of $\\tau_{qp}\n\\approx 30$--$40~\\mu$s and spectral resolution, $R = \\lambda / \\Delta \\lambda$,\nof 8 at 406.6~nm. We compare PtSi MKIDs to those fabricated with TiN and detail\nthe substantial advantages that PtSi MKIDs have to offer.\n", "  Galactic open clusters (OCs) that survive the early gas-expulsion phase are\ngradually destroyed over time by the action of disruptive dynamical processes.\nTheir final evolutionary stages are characterized by a poorly populated\nconcentration of stars called open cluster remnant (OCR). This study is devoted\nto assess the real physical nature of the OCR candidate NGC 7193. GMOS/Gemini\nspectroscopy of 53 stars in the inner target region were obtained to derive\nradial velocities and atmospheric parameters. We also employed photometric and\nproper motion data. The analysis method consists of the following steps: (i)\nanalysis of the statistical resemblance between the cluster and a set of field\nsamples with respect to the sequences defined in colour-magnitude diagrams\n(CMDs); (ii) a 5-dimensional iteractive exclusion routine was employed to\nidentify outliers from kinematical and positional data; (iii) isochrone fitting\nto the $K_{s}\\times(J-K_{s})$ CMD of the remaining stars and the dispersion of\nspectral types along empirical sequences in the $(J-H)\\times(H-K_{s})$ diagram\nwas checked. A group of stars was identified for which the mean heliocentric\ndistance is compatible with that obtained via isochrone fitting and whose\nmetallicities are compatible with each other. Fifteen member stars observed\nspectroscopically were identified together with other 19 probable members. Our\nresults indicate that NGC 7193 is a genuine OCR, of an once very populous OC,\nfor which the following parameters were derived: $d=501\\,\\pm\\,46\\,$pc,\n$t=2.5\\,\\pm\\,1.2\\,$Gyr, $\\langle\\,[Fe/H]\\,\\rangle=-0.17\\,\\pm\\,0.23$ and\n$E(B-V)=0.05\\,\\pm\\,0.05$. Its luminosity and mass functions show depletion of\nlow mass stars, confirming the OCR dynamically evolved state.\n", "  We scrutinize the behaviour of hydrogen atom's eigenvalues in a quantum\nplasma as it interacts with electric field directed along $\\theta=\\pi$ and\nexposed to linearly polarized intense laser field radiation. Using the\nKramers-Henneberger (KH) unitary transformation, which is semiclassical\ncounterpart of the Block-Nordsieck transformation in the quantized field\nformalism, the squared vector potential that appears in the equation of motion\nis eliminated and the resultant equation is expressed in KH frame. Within this\nframe, the resulting potential and the corresponding wavefunction have been\nexpanded in Fourier series and using Ehlotzky's approximation, we obtain a\nlaser-dressed potential to simulate intense laser field. By fitting the\nexponential-cosine-screened Coulomb potential into the laser-dressed potential,\nand then expanding it in Taylor series up to $\\mathcal{O}(r^4,\\alpha_0^9)$, we\nobtain the eigensolution (eigenvalues and wavefunction) of hydrogen atom in\nlaser-plasma encircled by electric field, within the framework of perturbation\ntheory formalism. Our numerical results show that for a weak external electric\nfield and gargantuan length of Debye screening parameter, the system is\nstrongly repulsive in contrast for strong external electric field and small\nlength of Debye screening parameter, the system is very attractive. This work\nhas potential application in the areas of atomic and molecular processes in\nexternal fields including interactions with strong fields and short pulses.\n", "  We propose a method for directly producing radially and azimuthally polarized\nphoton pairs through spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC). This method\nconstitutes a novel geometry for SPDC, in which a radially polarized\nBessel-Gauss pump beam is directed into a nonlinear crystal, with the central\npropagation direction parallel to the crystal axis. The phasematching\nconditions are controlled by changing the opening angle of the pump beam; as\nthe crystal axis cannot be tuned, we refer to this process as super-critical\nphasematching. We model and plot the spatial and polarization output\ndistributions for Type-I and Type-II super-critical phasematching.\n", "  The angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy lineshapes of quasi\none-dimensional (1d) Li0.9Mo6O17 display both agreement with and departures\nfrom the one-band Tomonaga-Luttinger model. We show that the departures can be\nunderstood by explicitly accounting for the four modes arising from the two\nquasi-1d bands known to cross the Fermi energy. The key assumption is that the\nantisymmetric charge mode is gapped with a magnitude near the temperature (T)\nof a mysterious 25K powerlaw resistivity upturn. The gap is consistent with the\nlack of a charge or spin density wave accompanying the upturn, is able to\ncontrol the upturn T, and prevents crossover to a Fermi liquid (FL) down to the\nsuperconducting transition at 1.9K.\n", "  The band structure in phononic crystals (PCs) is usually affected by the\ndeformations of their soft components. In this work, hyperelastic\ntransformation media is proposed to be integrated in the PCs'design, to achieve\nstable elastic band-gaps which is independent with finite mechanical\ndeformations. For a one-dimensional (1D) PC, we demonstrate the semi-linear\nsoft component can keep all elastic wave bands unchanged with the external\ndeformation field. While for neo-Hookean soft component, only S-wave bands can\nbe precisely retained. The change of the P-wave bands can be predicted by using\na lumped mass method. Numerical simulations are performed to validate our\ntheory predictions and the robustness of the proposed PCs.\n", "  We report on the synthesis of perovskite SrIrO3 thin films using sputtering\ntechnique. Single phase (110) oriented SrIrO$_3$ thin films were epitaxially\ngrown on SrTiO3 (001) substrate. Using off-axis XRD $\\theta-2\\theta$ scans, we\ndemonstrate that these films exhibit (110) out-of-plane orientation with (001)\nand (1-10) lying in-plane. The sputtering grown thin films have a smooth,\nhomogeneous surface, and excellent coherent interface with the substrate.\n", "  Scanning laser confocal holographic microscopy using a spatial heterodyne\ndetection method is presented. Spatial heterodyne detection technique employs a\nMach-Zehnder interferometer with the reference beam frequency shifted by two\nacousto-optic modulators (AOM) relative to the object beam frequency. Different\nfrom the traditional temporal heterodyne detection technique in which hundreds\ntemporal samples are taken at each scanning point to achieve the complex\nsignal, the spatial heterodyne detection technique generates spatial\ninterference fringes by use of a linear tempo-spatial relation provided by\ngalvanometer scanning in a typical line-scanning confocal microscope or for the\nslow-scanning on one dimension in a point-scanning confocal microscope, thereby\nsignificantly reducing sampling rate and increasing the signal to noise ratio\nunder the same illumination compared to the traditional temporal heterodyne\ncounterpart. The proposed spatial heterodyne detection scheme applies to both\nline-scanning and point-scanning confocal microscopes. In this paper, we\npresent the mathematical principles of the spatial heterodyne detection method\nand experimental schemes for both line-scanning and point-scanning confocal\nmicroscopes. Computer experiments are provided to demonstrate the validity of\nthis idea. The presented spatial heterodyne scanning laser confocal holographic\nmicroscope (SH-SLCHM) can obtain both amplitude and quantitative phase\ninformation of the object field without a significant increase in complexity of\noptical and electronic design on the basis of a traditional scanning laser\nconfocal microscope (SLCM). SH-SLCHM may find applications in optical\nmetrology, in-vivo tissue imaging, and ophthalmic imaging.\n", "  The spatial arrangement of galaxies (of satellites on a scale of 100kpc) as\nwell as their three-dimensional distribution in galaxy groups such as the Local\nGroup (on a scale of 1Mpc), the distribution of galaxies in the nearby volume\nof galaxies (on a scale of 8Mpc) and in the nearby Universe (on a scale of\n1Gpc) is considered. There is further evidence that the CMB shows\nirregularities and for anisotropic cosmic expansion. The overall impression one\nobtains, given the best data we have, is matter to be arranged as not expected\nin the dark-matter based standard model of cosmology (SMoC). There appears to\nbe too much structure, regularity and organisation. Dynamical friction on the\ndark matter halos is a strong direct test for the presence of dark matter\nparticles, but this process does not appear to be operative in the real\nUniverse. This evidence suggests strongly that dynamically relevant dark matter\ndoes not exist and therefore cosmology remains largely not understood\ntheoretically. More-accepted awareness of this case would by itself constitute\na major advance in research providing fabulous opportunities for bright minds,\nand the observational data strongly suggest that gravitation must be\neffectively Milgromian, corresponding to a generalized Poisson equation in the\nclassical limit. Thus, physical cosmology offers a significant historically\nrelevant opportunity for ground-breaking work, at least for those daring to do\nso.\n", "  M104 (NGC 4594; the Sombrero galaxy) is a nearby, well-studied elliptical\ngalaxy included in scores of surveys focused on understanding the details of\ngalaxy evolution. Despite the importance of observations of M104, a consensus\ndistance has not yet been established. Here, we use newly obtained Hubble Space\nTelescope optical imaging to measure the distance to M104 based on the tip of\nthe red giant branch method. Our measurement yields the distance to M104 to be\n9.55 +/- 0.13 +/- 0.31 Mpc equivalent to a distance modulus of 29.90 +/- 0.03\n+/- 0.07 mag. Our distance is an improvement over previous results as we use a\nwell-calibrated, stable distance indicator, precision photometry in a optimally\nselected field of view, and a Bayesian Maximum Likelihood technique that\nreduces measurement uncertainties. The most discrepant previous results are due\nto Tully-Fisher method distances, which are likely inappropriate for M104 given\nits peculiar morphology and structure. Our results are part of a larger program\nto measure accurate distances to a sample of well-known spiral galaxies\n(including M51, M74, and M63) using the tip of the red giant branch method.\n", "  Recent years have witnessed growing interest in the development of\nsmall-footprint lasers for potential applications in small-volume sensing and\non-chip optical communications. Surface-plasmons, electromagnetic modes\nevanescently confined to metal-dielectric interfaces, offer an effective route\nto achieving lasing at nanometer-scale dimensions when resonantly amplified in\ncontact with a gain-medium. Here, we achieve visible frequency ultra-narrow\nlinewidth lasing at room-temperature by leveraging surface plasmons propagating\nin an open Fabry-Perot cavity formed by a flat metal surface coated with a\nsubwavelength-thick layer of optically-pumped gain medium and orthogonally\nbound by a pair of flat metal sidewalls. Low perturbation\ntransmission-configuration sampling of the lasing plasmon mode is achieved via\nan evanescently coupled recessed nanoslit, opening the way to\nhigh-figure-of-merit refractive-index sensing of analytes interacting with the\nopen cavity.\n", "  We describe a very compact (0.9 m high, 0.4 m diameter, 40 kg) battery\noperable neutron scatter camera designed for field deployment. Unlike most\nother systems, the configuration of the sixteen liquid-scintillator detection\ncells are arranged to provide omnidirectional (4{\\pi}) imaging with sensitivity\ncomparable to a conventional two-plane system. Although designed primarily to\noperate as a neutron scatter camera for localizing energetic neutron sources,\nit also functions as a Compton camera for localizing gamma sources. In addition\nto describing the radionuclide source localization capabilities of this system,\nwe demonstrate how it provides neutron spectra that can distinguish plutonium\nmetal from plutonium oxide sources, in addition to the easier task of\ndistinguishing AmBe from fission sources.\n", "  In this paper the relaxed micromorphic continuum model with weighted free and\ngradient micro-inertia is used to describe the dynamical behavior of a real\ntwo-dimensional phononic crystal for a wide range of wavelengths. In\nparticular, a periodic structure with specific micro-structural topology and\nmechanical properties, capable of opening a phononic band-gap, is chosen with\nthe criterion of showing a low degree of anisotropy (the band-gap is almost\nindependent of the direction of propagation of the traveling wave). A Bloch\nwave analysis is performed to obtain the dispersion curves and the\ncorresponding vibrational modes of the periodic structure. A linear-elastic,\nisotropic, relaxed micromorphic model including both a free micro-inertia\n(related to free vibrations of the microstructures) and a gradient\nmicro-inertia (related to the motions of the microstructure which are coupled\nto the macro-deformation of the unit cell) is introduced and particularized to\nthe case of plane wave propagation. The parameters of the relaxed model, which\nare independent of frequency, are then calibrated on the dispersion curves of\nthe phononic crystal showing an excellent agreement in terms of both dispersion\ncurves and vibrational modes. Almost all the homogenized elastic parameters of\nthe relaxed micromorphic model result to be determined. This opens the way to\nthe design of morphologically complex meta-structures which make use of the\nchosen phononic structure as the basic building block and which preserve its\nability of \"stopping\" elastic wave propagation at the scale of the structure.\n", "  Friendship is a fundamental characteristic of human beings and usually\nassumed to be reciprocal in nature. Despite this common expectation, in\nreality, not all friendships by default are reciprocal nor created equal. Here,\nwe show that reciprocated friendships are more intimate and they are\nsubstantially different from those that are not. We examine the role of\nreciprocal ties in inducing more effective peer pressure in a cooperative\narrangements setting and find that the directionality of friendship ties can\nsignificantly limit the ability to persuade others to act. Specifically, we\nobserve a higher behavioral change and more effective peer-influence when\nsubjects shared reciprocal ties with their peers compared to sharing unilateral\nones. Moreover, through spreading process simulation, we find that although\nunilateral ties diffuse behaviors across communities, reciprocal ties play more\nimportant role at the early stages of the diffusion process.\n", "  We present systematic investigations on the shock responses of nanoporous\naluminum (np-Al) by nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations. The\ndislocation nucleation sites are found to concentrate in low latitude region\nnear the equator of the spherical void surfaces. We propose a continuum wave\nreflection theory and a resolved shear stress model to explain the distribution\nof dislocation nucleation sites. The simulations reveals two mechanisms of void\ncollapse: the plasticity mechanism and the internal jetting mechanism. The\nplasticity mechanism, which leads to transverse collapse of voids, prevails\nunder relatively weaker shocks; while the internal jetting mechanism, which\nleads to longitudinal filling of the void vacuum, plays more significant role\nas the shock intensity increases. In addition, an abnormal thermodynamic\nphenomenon (i.e., arising of temperature with pressure dropping) in shocked\nnp-Al is discovered. This phenomenon is incompatible with the conventional\nRankine-Hugoniot theory, and is explained by the nonequilibrium processes\ninvolved in void collapse. The influences of void collapse on spall fracture of\nnp-Al is studied. Under the same loading velocity, the spall strength of np-Al\nis found to be lower than that of single-crystal Al; but the spall resistance\nis higher in np-Al than in single-crystal Al. This is explained by the combined\ninfluences of thermal dissipation and stress attenuation during shock wave\npropagation in np-Al.\n", "  What happens when two synchronized clocks on a rigid beam are both given the\nexact same acceleration profile? Will they remain synchronized? What if we use\na rigid-rod Rindler acceleration profile? The special relativity prediction\nsurprises many people. This experimental setup is the special-relativity analog\nof the gravitational redshift. Just like two clocks higher and lower in a\ngravitational field lose synchronization, one sees a loss of synchronization in\nthese clocks with `identical' acceleration profiles. To the best of our\nknowledge this equivalence principle analog has never been directly measured,\nand current experimental techniques are sensitive enough to measure it. We\ndiscuss the origin of the essential physics behind this synchronization loss,\nand some special conditions which simplify its experimental observation. We\ndiscuss the origin of the essential physics behind this synchronization loss,\nand some special conditions which simplify its experimental observation. If\nvalidated this effect will not only test the equivalence principle from a new\nvantage, but it may one day aid in understanding and enhancing future\nultra-precise navigation systems.\n", "  A two dimensional electrostatic Particle-in-Cell simulation code is developed\nto investigate anisotropy of ions in a trench geometry for plasma etching. The\nnumerical simulation results suggest that if the trench width is larger than\nDebye length scale, anisotropy can be lost due to potential development across\nthe trench. Furthermore, the effects of ion charge build up on the trench\nbottom is investigated, which can degrade the anisotropy.\n", "  We investigate the decoherence dynamics of continuous variable entanglement\nas the system-environment coupling strength varies from the weak-coupling to\nthe strong-coupling regimes. Due to the existence of localized modes in the\nstrong-coupling regime, the system cannot approach equilibrium with its\nenvironment, which induces a nonequilibrium quantum phase transition. We\nanalytically solve the entanglement decoherence dynamics for an arbitrary\nspectral density. The nonequilibrium quantum phase transition is demonstrated\nas the system-environment coupling strength varies for all the Ohmic-type\nspectral densities. The 3-D entanglement quantum phase diagram is obtained.\n", "  Excitonic effects in solids can be calculated using the Bethe-Salpeter\nequation (BSE) or the Casida equation of time-dependent density-functional\ntheory (TDDFT). In both methods, the Tamm-Dancoff approximation (TDA), which\ndecouples excitations and de-excitations, is widely used to reduce\ncomputational cost. Here, we study the effect of the TDA on exciton binding\nenergies of solids obtained from the Casida equation using long-range corrected\n(LRC) exchange-correlation kernels. We find that the TDA underestimates\nTDDFT-LRC exciton binding energies of semiconductors slightly, but those of\ninsulators significantly (i.e., by more than 100%), and thus it is essential to\nsolve the full Casida equation to describe strongly bound excitons. These\nfindings are relevant in the ongoing search for accurate and efficient TDDFT\napproaches for excitons.\n", "  Experimental excitation functions for proton induced reactions on natural\nvanadium in the 37-65 MeV energy range were measured with the activation method\nusing a stacked foil irradiation technique. By using high resolution gamma\nspectrometry cross-section data for the production of $^{51,48}$Cr, $^{48}$V,\n$^{48,47,46,44m,44g,43}$Sc and $^{43,42}$K were determined. Comparisons with\nthe earlier published data are presented and results predicted by different\ntheoretical codes (EMPIRE and TALYS) are included. Thick target yields were\ncalculated from a fit to our experimental excitation curves and compared with\nthe earlier experimental yield data. Depth distribution curves to be used for\nthin layer activation (TLA) are also presented.\n", "  We report on the spin structure of the pyrochlore iridate Nd$_2$Ir$_2$O$_7$\nthat could be directly determined by means of powder neutron diffraction. Our\nmagnetic structure refinement unravels a so-called all-in/all-out magnetic\nstructure that appears in both, the Nd and the Ir sublattice. The ordered\nmagnetic moments at 1.8 K amount to 0.34(1) $\\mu_\\mathrm{B}$/Ir$^{4+}$ and\n1.27(1) $\\mu_\\mathrm{B}$/Nd$^{3+}$. The Nd$^{3+}$ moment size at 1.8 K is\nsmaller than that expected for the Nd$^{3+}$ ground state doublet. On the other\nhand, the size of the ordered moments of the Ir$^{4+}$ ions at 1.8 K agrees\nvery well with the value expected for a $J_\\mathrm{eff}$ = 1/2 state based on\nthe presence of strong spin-orbit coupling in this system. Finally, our\nmeasurements reveal a parallel alignment of the Nd$^{3+}$ moments with the net\nmoment of its six nearest neighboring Ir$^{4+}$ ions.\n", "  We compare the heat release data of organic glasses with that of amorphous\nand glass like crystalline solids. Anomalous behavior was found in all these\nmaterials, which disagrees with the standard tunneling model. We can explain\nthe most of the experimental observations within a phenomenological model,\nwhere we assume that for a part of tunneling systems the barrier heights are\nstrongly reduced as a consequence of the local stress produced during the\ncooling process.\n", "  The evolution of the electronic structure of BiTeI, a layered semiconductor\nwith a van der Waals gap, under compression is studied by employing semilocal\nand dispersion-corrected density-functional calculations. Comparative analysis\nof the results of these calculations shows that the band-gap energy of BiTeI\ndecreases till it attains a minimum value of zero at a critical pressure, after\nwhich it increases again. The critical pressure corresponding to the closure of\nthe band gap is calculated, at which BiTeI becomes a topological insulator.\nComparison of the critical pressure to the pressure at which BiTeI undergoes a\nstructural phase transition indicates that the closure of the band gap would\nnot be hindered by a structural transformation. Moreover, the band-gap pressure\ncoefficients of BiTeI are computed, and an expression of the critical pressure\nis devised in terms of these coefficients. Our findings indicate that the\nsemilocal and dispersion-corrected approaches are in conflict about the\ncompressibility of BiTeI, which result in overestimation and underestimation,\nrespectively. Nevertheless, the effect of pressure on the atomic structure of\nBiTeI is found to be manifested primarily as the reduction of the width of the\nvan der Waals gap according to both approaches, which also yield consistent\npredictions concerning the interlayer metallic bonding in BiTeI under\ncompression. It is consequently shown that the calculated band-gap energies\nfollow qualitatively and quantitatively the same trend within the two\napproximations employed here, and the transition to the zero-gap state occurs\nat the same critical width of the van der Waals gap.\n", "  Dissipative solitons are stable localized coherent structures with linear\nfrequency chirp generated in normal-dispersion mode-locked lasers. The soliton\nenergy in fiber lasers is limited by the Raman effect, but implementation of\nintracavity feedback for the Stokes wave enables synchronous generation of a\ncoherent Raman dissipative soliton. Here we demonstrate a new approach for\ngenerating chirped pulses at new wavelengths by mixing in a highly-nonlinear\nfiber of two frequency-shifted dissipative solitons, as well as cascaded\ngeneration of their clones forming a \"dissipative soliton comb\" in the\nfrequency domain. We observed up to eight equidistant components in a 400-nm\ninterval demonstrating compressibility from ~10 ps to ~300 fs. This approach,\nbeing different from traditional frequency combs, can inspire new developments\nin fundamental science and applications.\n", "  Nanometric magnonic and spintronic devices need magnetic field control in\naddition to conventional electronic control. In this work we review ways to\nreplace magnetic field control by an electronic one in order to circumvent\nappearance of stray magnetic fields or the difficulty of creating large\nmagnetic fields over nanometric distances. Voltage control is compared to\ncurrent control and corresponding devices are compared from their energetic\nefficiency point of view.\n", "  We provide a self-contained introduction for entanglement-assisted quantum\nerror-correcting codes in this book chapter.\n", "  The miniaturization of machines towards the micron and nanoscales requires\nthe development of joint-like elements that enable and constrain motion. We\npresent a facile method to create colloidal joints, that is, anisotropic\ncolloidal particles containing surface mobile DNA linkers that control the\nmotion range of bonded particles. We demonstrate quantitatively that we can\ncontrol the flexibility of these colloidal joints by tuning the DNA linker\nconcentration in the bond area. We show that the colloidal shape controls the\nrange of motion that these colloidal joints enable, due to the finite-sized\npatch of bonded linkers that cannot cross regions of high curvature. Finally we\ndemonstrate the potential of the colloidal joints for programmable bottom-up\nself-assembly by creating flexible colloidal molecules and colloidal polymers.\nThe reconfigurability and motion constraint offered by our colloidal joints\nmake them promising building blocks for the development of switchable materials\nand nanorobots.\n", "  $\\textbf{Background:}$ The deuteron shows the essential features of\nshort-range correlations found in all nuclei. Experimental observables related\nto short-range correlations are connected with the high-momentum components of\none- and two-body momentum distributions. An intuitive understanding of\nshort-range correlations is provided by the suppression of the two-body density\nin coordinate space at small distances.\n  $\\textbf{Purpose:}$ The Wigner function provides a quasi-probability\ndistribution in phase-space that allows to investigate short-range correlations\nas a function of distance and relative momentum in a unified picture.\n  $\\textbf{Method:}$ The Wigner function for the deuteron is calculated for\nbare and SRG evolved AV8' and N3LO interactions and investigated as a function\nof distance, relative momentum and angular orientation. Partial momentum and\ncoordinate space distributions are obtained by integrating over parts of phase\nspace.\n  $\\textbf{Results:}$ The Wigner function shows a pronounced low-momentum peak\nthat is not affected by short-range correlations and a high-momentum shoulder\nat small distances that reflects short-range correlations. Oscillations of the\nWigner function are related to interference of low- and high-momentum\ncomponents.\n  $\\textbf{Conclusions:}$ Short-range correlations are a truly\nquantum-mechanical phenomenon caused by interference of low- and high-momentum\ncomponents in the wave function.\n", "  We study the electronic transport properties of a monolayer graphene with a\none-dimensional modulated height profile caused, for instance, by substrate\nondulations. We show that the combined effect of the resulting strain fields\ninduce modulated scalar and vector potentials that give rise to Weiss\noscillations in the magnetoconductivity. We also find that similar effects can\nbe obtained by applying a parallel magnetic field to the graphene-substrate\ninterface. The parameters of an experimental set-up for a physical realization\nof these findings in graphene systems are discussed.\n", "  Quantum key distribution (QKD) provides an attractive means for securing\ncommunications in optical fibre networks. However, deployment of the technology\nhas been hampered by the frequent need for dedicated dark fibres to segregate\nthe very weak quantum signals from conventional traffic. Up until now the\ncoexistence of QKD with data has been limited to bandwidths that are orders of\nmagnitude below those commonly employed in fibre optic communication networks.\nUsing an optimised wavelength divisional multiplexing scheme, we transport QKD\nand the prevalent 100 Gb/s data format in the forward direction over the same\nfibre for the first time. We show a full quantum encryption system operating\nwith a bandwidth of 200 Gb/s over a 100 km fibre. Exploring the ultimate limits\nof the technology by experimental measurements of the Raman noise, we\ndemonstrate it is feasible to combine QKD with 10 Tb/s of data over a 50 km\nlink. These results suggest it will be possible to integrate QKD and other\nquantum photonic technologies into high bandwidth data communication\ninfrastructures, thereby allowing their widespread deployment.\n", "  We study the sensitivity of top pair production with six-fermion decay at the\nLHC to the presence and nature of an underlying Z' boson, accounting for full\ntree-level Standard Model ttbar interference, with all intermediate particles\nallowed off-shell. We concentrate on the lepton-plus-jets final state and\nsimulate experimental conditions, including kinematic requirements and top\nquark pair reconstruction in the presence of missing transverse energy and\ncombinatorial ambiguity in jet-top assignment. We focus on the differential\nmass spectra of the cross section and asymmetry observables, especially\ndemonstrating the use of the latter in probing the coupling structure of a new\nneutral resonance, in addition to cases in which the asymmetry forms a\ncomplementary discovery observable.\n", "  There are many orbital excited mesons discovered in recent years. In this\nwork we attempt to study whether the Regge trajectory is quasi-linear or\nsquare-root form. In the framework of the quasi-linear Regge trajectory and\nsquare-root Regge trajectory, the masses of the states lying on the well\nestablished 11S0, 13S1, and 13P2 trajectories are estimated. Comparison of the\nresults given by the two trajectories with the existing experimental data\nillustrates that both of them can give a reasonable description for the ground\nmesons. For the orbital excited states, the quasi-linear trajectory describes\nthe existing meson spectrum to be more reasonable.\n", "  A personal perspective on the future challenges of research in particle\nphysics is presented with emphasis on the role of DIS physics in this\nendeavour.\n", "  We investigate the possibility of achieving high-temperature\nsuperconductivity in hydrides under pressure by inducing metallization of\notherwise insulating phases through doping, a path previously used to render\nstandard semiconductors superconducting at ambient pressure. Following this\nidea, we study H$_2$O, one of the most abundant and well-studied substances, we\nidentify nitrogen as the most likely and promising substitution/dopant. We show\nthat for realistic levels of doping of a few percent, the phase X of ice\nbecomes superconducting with a critical temperature of about 60 K at 150GPa. In\nview of the vast number of hydrides that are strongly covalent bonded, but that\nremain insulating until rather large pressures, our results open a series of\nnew possibilities in the quest for novel high-temperature superconductors.\n", "  We consider exclusive $pp \\to pp \\pi^{+} \\pi^{-}$ and $pp \\to pp \\pi^{+}\n\\pi^{-}\\pi^{+} \\pi^{-}$ reactions at high energies. The calculation is based on\na tensor pomeron model and the amplitudes for the processes are formulated in\nan effective field-theoretic approach. In the case of $pp \\to pp \\pi^{+}\n\\pi^{-}$ process we consider both diffractive and photoproduction mechanisms\nand we include the non-resonant $\\pi^{+}\\pi^{-}$ continuum and the resonance\n$f_{0}(500)$, $f_{0}(980)$, $f_{2}(1270)$, $\\rho(770)$ contributions. We\ndiscuss how two pomerons couple to tensor meson $f_{2}(1270)$ and the\ninterference effects of resonance and dipion continuum. We find that the\nrelative contribution of resonances $\\rho(770)$, $f_2(1270)$ and dipion\ncontinuum strongly depends on the cut on proton transverse momenta. In the case\nof exclusive central $4 \\pi$ production we include the contribution via the\nintermediate $\\sigma\\sigma$ and $\\rho\\rho$ states. For both processes the\ntheoretical results have been compared with the experimental data and\npredictions for planned or being carried out experiments (e.g. STAR,\nATLAS-ALFA) are presented.\n", "  Weak vector boson scattering at high energies will be one of the key\nmeasurements in current and upcoming LHC runs. It is most sensitive to any new\nphysics associated with electroweak symmetry breaking. However, a conventional\nEFT analysis will fail at high energies. To address this problem, we present a\nparameter-free prescription valid for arbitrary perturbative and\nnon-perturbative models: the T-matrix unitarization. We describe its\nimplementation as an asymptotically consistent reference model matched to the\nlow-energy effective theory. We show examples of typical observables of\nvector-boson scattering at the LHC in our unitarized framework. For many\nstrongly-coupled models like composite Higgs models, dimension-8 operators\nmight be actually the leading operators. In addition to those longitudinal and\ntransversal dimension eight EFT operators, the effects of generic tensor and\nscalar resonances within simplified models are considered.\n", "  In the present work, extended Argon ion bombardment was used to modify\nanatase TiO2 nanotube (NTs) layers. In situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy\nrevealed a high content of sub-oxide formed (Ti3+, Ti2+ states) in the nanotube\nlayers. These samples were tested for their ability to show open-circuit\nphotocatalytic hydrogen evolution. We found for UV (cw laser 325nm)\nillumination as well as for AM1.5 conditions, a strongly enhanced H2 evolution\nactivity in absence of the usual noble metal-nanoparticle decoration. We\nconclude therefore that these sub-oxide states can play an important role in\nthe activation of TiO2 nanotubes - namely as a H2 evolution co-catalyst.\n", "  In accelerator and plasma physics it is accepted that there is no need to\nsolve the dynamical equations for particles in covariant form, i.e. by using\nthe coordinate-independent proper time to parameterize particle world-lines in\nspace-time: to describe dynamics in the laboratory frame, there is no need to\nuse the laws of relativistic kinematics. It is sufficient to account for the\nrelativistic dependence of particles momenta on the velocity in the second\nNewton's law. Then, the coupling of fields and particles is based on the use of\nresult from particle dynamics treated according to Newton's laws in terms of\nthe relativistic three-momentum and on the use of Maxwell's equations in\nstandard form. Previously, we argued that this is a misconception. Here we\ndescribe in detail how to calculate the coupling between fields and particles\nin a correct way and how to develop a new algorithm for a particle tracking\ncode in agreement with the use of Maxwell's equations in their standard form.\nAdvanced textbooks on classical electrodynamics correctly tell us that\nMaxwell's equations in standard form in the laboratory frame and charged\nparticles are coupled by introducing particles trajectories as projections of\nparticles world-lines onto coordinates of the laboratory frame and then by\nusing the laboratory time to parameterize the trajectory curves. We show a\ndifference between conventional and covariant particle tracking results in the\nlaboratory frame. This essential point has never received attention in the\nphysical community. Only the solution of the dynamical equations in covariant\nform gives the correct coupling between field equations in standard form and\nparticles trajectories in the laboratory frame. Previous theoretical and\nsimulation results in accelerator and plasma physics should be re-examined in\nthe light of the pointed difference between conventional and covariant particle\ntracking.\n", "  In a radio interferometer, the determination of geometrical antenna positions\nrelies on accurate calibration of the dry and wet delay of the atmosphere above\neach antenna. For the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA),\nwhich has baseline lengths up to 16 kilometers, the geography of the site\nforces the height above mean sea level of the more distant antenna pads to be\nsignificantly lower than the central array. Thus, both the ground level\nmeteorological values and the total water column can be quite different between\nantennas in the extended configurations. During 2015, a network of six\nadditional weather stations was installed to monitor pressure, temperature,\nrelative humidity and wind velocity, in order to test whether inclusion of\nthese parameters could improve the repeatability of antenna position\ndeterminations in these configurations. We present an analysis of the data\nobtained during the ALMA Long Baseline Campaign of Oct. through Nov. 2015. The\nrepeatability of antenna position measurements typically degrades as a function\nof antenna distance. Also, the scatter is more than three times worse in the\nvertical direction than in the local tangent plane, suggesting that a\nsystematic effect is limiting the measurements. So far we have explored\ncorrecting the delay model for deviations from hydrostatic equilibrium in the\nmeasured air pressure and separating the partial pressure of water from the\ntotal pressure using water vapor radiometer (WVR) data. Correcting for these\ncombined effects still does not provide a good match to the residual position\nerrors in the vertical direction. One hypothesis is that the current model of\nwater vapor may be too simple to fully remove the day-to-day variations in the\nwet delay. We describe possible avenues of improvement, including measuring and\napplying more accurate values of the sky coupling efficiency of the WVRs.\n", "  The $\\Omega$-background is defined for supergravity, and a very general class\nof such backgrounds is constructed for 11-dimensional supergravity.\n11-dimensional supergravity in a certain $\\Omega$-background is shown to be\nequivalent to a 5-dimensional non-commutative gauge theory of Chern-Simons\ntype. M2 and M5 branes are expressed as 1 and 2-dimensional extended objects in\nthe 5-dimensional gauge theory. This 5-dimensional gauge theory is shown to\nadmit a consistent quantization with two coupling constants, despite being\nformally non-renormalizable.\n  A check of a twisted version of AdS/CFT is performed relating this\n5-dimensional non-commutative gauge theory to the theory on N M5 branes,\nwrapping an $A_{k-1}$ singularity and placed in an $\\Omega$-background. The\noperators on the M5 branes, in the $\\Omega$-background, are described by a\ncertain chiral algebra which in the large N limit becomes a $W_{k+\\infty}$\nalgebra. This chiral algebra is recovered from the 5-dimensional gauge theory.\n  This argument also provides a holographic explanation of the result of\nMaulik-Okounkov and Schiffmann-Vasserot that the $W_{k+\\infty}$ algebra acts on\nthe equivariant cohomology of the moduli of instantons on an $A_{k-1}$\nsingularity.\n", "  In this paper we continue to study the shock formation for the\n$3$-dimensional quasilinear wave equation \\begin{align}\\label{main eq}\n-(1+3G\"(0)(\\partial_{t}\\phi)^{2})\\partial^{2}_{t}\\phi+\\Delta\\phi=0,\\tag{\\textbf{$\\star$}}\n\\end{align} with $G\"(0)$ being a non-zero constant. Since \\eqref{main eq}\nadmits global-in-time solution with small initial data, to present shock\nformation, we consider a class of large data. Moreover, no symmetric assumption\nis imposed on the data. Compared to our previous work [18], here we pose data\non the hypersurface $\\{(t,x)|t=-r_{0}\\}$ instead of $\\{(t,x)|t=-2\\}$, with\n$r_{0}$ being arbitrarily large. We prove an a priori energy estimate\nindependent of $r_{0}$. Therefore a complete description of the solution\nbehavior as $r_{0}\\rightarrow\\infty$ is obtained. This allows us to relax the\nrestriction on the profile of initial data which still guarantees shock\nformation. Since \\eqref{main eq} can be viewed as a model equation for\ndescribing the propagation of electromagnetic waves in nonlinear dielectric,\nthe result in this paper reveals the possibility to use wave pulse with weak\nintensity to form electromagnetic shocks in laboratory. A main new feature in\nthe proof is that all estimates in the present paper do \\emph{not} depend on\nthe parameter $r_{0}$, which requires different methods to obtain energy\nestimates. As a byproduct, we prove the existence of semi-global-in-time\nsolutions which lead to shock formation by showing that the limits of the\ninitial energies exist as $r_{0}\\rightarrow\\infty$. The proof combines the\nideas in [5] where the the formation of shocks for 3-dimensional relativistic\ncompressible Euler equations with small initial data is established, and the\nshort pulse method introduced in [6] and generalized in [15], where the\nformation of black holes in general relativity is proved.\n", "  In the present work we investigate the photocatalytic hydrogen production\n(water splitting) activity of different Pt loaded TiO2 nanotube layers.\nTherefore, we fabricate free standing membranes and fix them in four different\nconfigurations: top up (with initiation layer grass or without) and bottom up\n(bottom closed or open), then decorate the tubes with various amounts of Pt and\nmeasure the open-circuit photocatalytic H2 production rate. We find a strong\ninfluence of the configuration with the open top morphology showing the highest\nphotocatalytic hydrogen production efficiency, these nanotubes yield 3.5 times\nmore H2 than the least efficient structure (bottom closed). The work therefore\nprovides valuable guidelines for optimizing TiO2 nanotube layers for\nphotocatalytic applications.\n", "  The present work reports on the enhancement of TiO2 nanotubes\nphotoelectrochemical water splitting rate by decorating the nanostructure with\nan amine layer in a hydrothermal process using diethylenetriamine (DETA). The\naminate coated TiO2 tubes show a stable improvement of the photoresponse in\nboth UV and visible light spectrum and under hydrothermal conditions, 4-fold\nincrease of the photoelectrochemical water splitting rate is observed. From\nintensity modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) measurements significantly\nfaster electron transport times are observed indicating a surface passivating\neffect of the N-decoration.\n", "  We give an example of a one-dimensional scalar spin energy with long-range\ninteractions not satisfying standard decay conditions and which admits a\ncontinuum approximation defined for functions u in BV((0,L),[-1,1]) taking into\naccount the total variation of u. Related minimum problems show boundary and\nsize effects in dependence of L.\n", "  We report on how to grow and control self-organized TiO2 nanotube arrays that\nshow defined and regular gaps between individual nanotubes. For this we use\nelectrochemical anodization of titanium in fluoride containing di-ethylene\nglycol (DEG) electrolytes, with variations in voltage and water content in the\nelectrolyte. In these specific electrolytes, such nanotubes show a true\nspacing, i.e. nanotubes are spaced both at top and at bottom in regular\nintervals, this in contrast to classic nanotubes obtained in other organic\nelectrolytes showing a close-packed organization. We identify critical\nparameters, that define the region of existence i.e. under which condition tube\nspacing occurs as well as the intertube distance, to be the voltage and the\nwater content. Using these findings allows to grow tubes where diameter and\nspacing can even be independently controlled.\n", "  In this work we introduce the use of TiN/Ti2 N layers as a back contact for\nlifted-off membranes of anodic Ta3N5 nanotube layers. In photoelectrochemical\nH2 generation experiments under simulated AM 1.5G light, shift of the onset\npotential for anodic photocurrents to lower potentials is observed, as well as\na higher magnitude of the photocurrents compared to conventional Ta3N5\nnanotubes (~ 0.5 V RHE ). We ascribe this beneficial effect to the improved\nconductive properties of the TiNx -based back contact layer that enables a\nfacilitated electron-transport for tantalum-nitride based materials to the\nconductive substrate.\n", "  This paper presents a partial proof of the non-linear stability of the\nexpanding region of Schwarzschild de Sitter cosmologies. We show that under\ndynamically realistic assumptions the conformal Weyl curvature decays towards\nnull infinity. Our assumptions are consistent with the expectation that a\ndynamical solution to Einstein's equations with positive cosmological constant\ndoes not converge globally to a member of the Kerr de Sitter family. In\nparticular in this problem the geometry of null infinity is a priori unknown.\nOne expects this result to form an essential part of a global existence proof\nfor the cosmological region, which - along with the precise asymptotics of\nthese solutions - is the subject of a subsequent paper.\n", "  We consider the simplified model of strategic allocation of trajectories in\nthe airspace presented in a previous publication. Two types of companies,\ncharacterized by different cost functions, compete for allocation of\ntrajectories in the airspace. We study how the equilibrium state of the model\ndepends on the traffic demand and number of airports. We show that in a mixed\npopulation environment the equilibrium solution is not the optimal at the\nglobal level, but rather than it tends to have a larger fraction of companies\nwho prefer to delay the departure time rather taking a longer routes. Finally\nwe study the evolutionary dynamics investigating the fluctuations of airline\ntypes around the equilibrium and the speed of convergence toward it in finite\npopulations. We find that the equilibrium point is shifted by the presence of\nnoise and is reached more slowly.\n", "  This article presents theoretical results for the dynamic response of\nperiodically surface-modulated ferromagnetic thin films. For such system, the\nrole of the periodic dipolar field induced by the modulation is addressed by\nusing the plane-wave method. By controlling the geometry of the modulated\nvolumes within the film, the frequency modes and spatial profiles of spin waves\ncan be manipulated. The angular dependence of the frequency band-gaps unveils\nthe influence of both dynamic and static magnetic charges, which reside in the\nedges of the etching periodic zones, and it is stablished that band-gap widths\ncreated by static magnetic charges are broader than the one created by dynamic\nmagnetic charges. To corroborate the validity of the model, the theoretical\nresults are compared with ferromagnetic resonance simulations, where a very\ngood agreement is achieved between both methods. The theoretical model allows\nfor a detailed understanding of the physics underlying these kind of systems,\nthereby providing an outlook to potential applications associated with magnonic\ncrystals-based devices.\n", "  Modern astronomy increasingly relies upon systematic surveys, whose dedicated\ntelescopes continuously observe the sky across varied wavelength ranges of the\nelectromagnetic spectrum; some surveys also observe non-electromagnetic\n\"messengers,\" such as high-energy particles or gravitational waves. Stars and\ngalaxies look different through the eyes of different instruments, and their\nindependent measurements have to be carefully combined to provide a complete,\nsound picture of the multicolor and eventful universe. The association of an\nobject's independent detections is, however, a difficult problem\nscientifically, computationally, and statistically, raising varied challenges\nacross diverse astronomical applications. The fundamental problem is finding\nrecords in survey databases with directions that match to within the direction\nuncertainties. Such astronomical versions of the record linkage problem are\nknown by various terms in astronomy: cross-matching, cross-identification, and\ndirectional, positional, or spatio-temporal coincidence assessment. Astronomers\nhave developed several statistical approaches for such problems, largely\nindependently of related developments in other disciplines. Here we review\nemerging approaches that compute (Bayesian) probabilities for the hypotheses of\ninterest: possible associations, or demographic properties of a cosmic\npopulation that depend on identifying associations. Many cross-identification\ntasks can be formulated within a hierarchical Bayesian partition model\nframework, with components that explicitly account for astrophysical effects\n(e.g., source brightness vs. wavelength, source motion, or source extent),\nselection effects, and measurement error. We survey recent developments, and\nhighlight important open areas for future research.\n", "  Applications of cavity optomechanics span from gravitational wave detection\nto the study of quantum motion states in mesoscopic mechanical systems. The\nengineering of resonators supporting strongly interacting mechanical and\noptical modes is central to these developments. However, current technological\nand experimental approaches limit the accessible mechanical frequencies to a\nfew GHz, imposing hard constraints on quantum mechanical studies. Here we\ndemonstrate the optical control of 20-100~GHz mechanical modes confined in the\nthree dimensions within semiconductor nano-optomechanical pillar cavities. We\nuse a time-resolved transient optical reflectivity technique and access both\nthe energy spectrum and dynamics of the mechanical modes at the picosecond\ntimescale. A strong increase of the optomechanical coupling upon reducing the\npillar size is observed together with unprecedent room temperature Q-frequency\nproducts above $10^{14}$. The measurements also reveal sideband generation in\nthe optomechanical response. Such resonators can naturally integrate quantum\nwells and quantum dots, enabling novel applications in cavity quantum\nelectrodynamics and high frequency nanomechanics.\n", "  Highly controlled coating of biomimetic polydopamine (PDA) was achieved on\ntitanium dioxide nanotubes (TiO2 NTs) by exposing TiO2 NT arrays to a slightly\nalkaline dopamine solution. The thin films act as photonic sensitizers\n(enhancing photocurrents and photodegradation) in the visible light range. The\nPDA coatings can furthermore be used as a platform for decorating the TiO2 NTs\nwith different co-catalysts and metal nanoparticles (NPs).\n", "  Subjecting a nanohelix to a transverse electric field gives rise to\nsuperlattice behavior with tunable electronic properties. We theoretically\ninvestigate such a system and find Bloch oscillations and negative differential\nconductance when a longitudinal electric field (along the nanohelix axis) is\nalso applied. Furthermore, we study dipole transitions across the\ntransverse-electric-field-induced energy gap, which can be tuned to the\neulogized terahertz frequency range by experimentally attainable external\nfields. We also reveal a photogalvanic effect by shining circularly polarized\nlight onto our helical quantum wire.\n", "  Gauge-invariant perturbation theory for theories with a Brout-Englert-Higgs\neffect, as developed by Fr\\\"ohlich, Morchio and Strocchi, starts out from\nphysical, exactly gauge-invariant quantities as initial and final states. These\nare composite operators, and can thus be considered as bound states. In case of\nthe standard model, this reduces almost entirely to conventional perturbation\ntheory. This explains the success of conventional perturbation theory for the\nstandard model. However, this is due to the special structure of the standard\nmodel, and it is not guaranteed to be the case for other theories. Here, we\nreview gauge-invariant perturbation theory. Especially, we show how it can be\napplied and that it is little more complicated than conventional perturbation\ntheory, and that it is often possible to utilize existing results of\nconventional perturbation theory. Finally, we present tests of the predictions\nof gauge-invariant perturbation theory, using lattice gauge theory, in three\ndifferent settings. In one case, the results coincide with conventional\nperturbation theory and with the lattice results. In a second case, it appears\nthat the results of gauge-invariant perturbation theory agree with the lattice,\nbut differ from conventional perturbation theory. In the third case both\napproaches fail due to quantum fluctuations.\n", "  We investigate the possible role of line-driven winds in the circumstellar\nenvelope in B[e] stars, mainly the role of the $\\Omega$-slow wind solution,\nwhich is characterized by a slower terminal velocity and higher mass-loss rate,\nin comparison with the standard (m-CAK) wind solution. In this work, we assume\ntwo scenarios: 1) a spherically symmetric star and 2) a scenario that considers\nthe oblate shape, considering only the oblate correction factor. For certain\nvalues of the line force parameters (according to previous works), we obtain in\nboth scenarios a density contrast $\\gtrsim10^{2}$ between equatorial and polar\ndensities, characterized for a fast polar wind and a slow and denser wind when\nthe $\\Omega$-slow wind solution is obtained. All this properties are enhanced\nwhen the oblate correction factor is included in our calculations.\n", "  Summary of recent ATLAS measurements of jet and photon production using\nproton-proton (pp) collisions from the Large Hadron Collider. The\ncharged-particle multiplicity in jets, and jet charge measurements are\npresented using 8 TeV pp collisions. Differential measurements of jet and\nphoton cross-sections are shown for 7, 8 and 13 TeV pp collisions.\n", "  We analyze the statistics of an estimator, denoted by xi_t and referred to as\nthe slave, for the equilibrium susceptibility of a one dimensional Langevin\nprocess x_t in a potential phi(x). The susceptibility can be measured by\nevolving the slave equation in conjunction with the original Langevin process.\nThis procedure yields a direct estimate of the susceptibility and avoids the\nneed, when performing numerical simulations, to include applied external fields\nexplicitly. The success of the method however depends on the statistical\nproperties of the slave estimator. The joint probability density function for\nx_t and xi_t is analyzed. In the case where the potential of the system has a\nconcave component the probability density function of the slave acquires a\npower law tail characterized by a temperature dependent exponent. Thus we show\nthat while the average value of the slave, in the equilibrium state, is always\nfinite and given by the fluctuation dissipation relation, higher moments and\nindeed the variance may show divergences. The behavior of the power law\nexponent is analyzed in a general context and it is calculated explicitly in\nsome specific examples. Our results are confirmed by numerical simulations and\nwe discuss possible measurement discrepancies in the fluctuation dissipation\nrelation which could arise due to this behavior.\n", "  The problem of the axial anomaly in the presence of the Bohm-Aharonov gauge\nvector field is exactly solved.\n"]}
