materials, the mobility of charge\ncarriers is strongly dependent on temperature and the electric field. Our\nnumerical study shows that both the energy distribution and the mobility of\ncharge carriers in systems with a Gaussian density of states, such as organic\ndisordered semiconductors, can be described by a single parameter - effective\ntemperature, dependent on the magnitude of the electric field. Furthermore,\nthis effective temperature does not depend on the concentration of charge\ncarriers, while the mobility does depend on the charge carrier concentration.\nThe concept of the effective temperature is shown to be valid for systems with\nand without space-energy correlations in the distribution of localized states.\n", "  We have performed a temperature-dependent angle-integrated laser\nphotoemission study of iron oxypnictide superconductors LaFeAsO:F and LaFePO:F\nexhibiting critical transition temperatures (Tc's) of 26 K and 5 K,\nrespectively. We find that high-Tc LaFeAsO:F exhibits a temperature-dependent\npseudogap-like feature extending over ~0.1 eV about the Fermi level at 250 K,\nwhereas such a feature is absent in low-Tc LaFePO:F. We also find ~20-meV\npseudogap-like features and signatures of superconducting gaps both in\nLaFeAsO:F and LaFePO:F. We discuss the possible origins of the unusual\npseudogap-like features through comparison with the high-Tc cuprates.\n", "  Microcrystals of diaquocobalt(II) oxalate have been synthesized by the\ncoprecipitation reaction of aqueous solutions of Cobalt (II) bromide and oxalic\nacid. Chemical analysis and thermal experiments revealed that there is only one\nphase present. X-ray powder diffraction studies show that this compound is\northorhombic with space group Cccm. Molar susceptibility versus temperature\nmeasurements show the existence of an antiferromagnetic ordering, however, the\nhysteresis measured in magnetization measurements as a function of magnetic\nfield reveals a weak ferromagnetic behavior.\n", "  The combination of the local-density approximation (LDA) with the\nrotationally invariant slave-boson theory (RISB) is used to investigate the\nrealistic correlated electronic structure of Sr$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$. From\nWannier-downfolding the low-energy band structure to a three-band model for the\nRu($t_{2g}$) states, the interacting problem is solved including intra- and\ninter-orbital Hubbard terms as well as spin-flip and pair-hopping interactions.\nTherewith it is possible to obtain valuable insight into the orbital\noccupations, relevant local spin multiplets and the fermiology with increasing\ncorrelation strength. Besides generic correlation-induced band-narrowing and\n-shifting, an intriguing quasiparticle structure close to the Fermi level is\nfound in the neigborhood of the notorious $\\gamma_2$ pocket in the Brillouin\nzone. Along the $\\Gamma$$-$$X$ direction in {\\bf k}-space, that structure\nappears very sensitive to electronic self-energy effects. The subtle\nsensitivity, connected also its manifest multi-orbital character, may put this\nvery low-energy structure in context with the puzzling metamagnetic properties\nof the compound.\n", "  We are investigating the dynamics of a new Poincar\\'e gauge theory of gravity\nmodel, which has cross coupling between the spin-0$^+$ and spin-0$^-$ modes. To\nthis end we here consider a very appropriate situation---homogeneous-isotropic\ncosmologies---which is relatively simple, and yet all the modes have\nnon-trivial dynamics which reveals physically interesting and possibly\nobservable results. More specifically we consider manifestly isotropic Bianchi\nclass A cosmologies; for this case we find an effective Lagrangian and\nHamiltonian for the dynamical system. The Lagrange equations for these models\nlead to a set of first order equations that are compatible with those found for\nthe FLRW models and provide a foundation for further investigations. Typical\nnumerical evolution of these equations shows the expected effects of the cross\nparity coupling.\n", "  We present a detailed analysis of the X-ray spectrum of the Seyfert 2 galaxy\nNGC454E, belonging to the interacting system NGC454. Observations performed\nwith Suzaku, XMM-Newton and Swift allowed us to detect a dramatic change in the\ncurvature of the 2-10 keV spectrum, revealing a significant variation of the\nabsorbing column density along the line of sight (from ~ 1 x10^{24}cm^{-2} to ~\n1x10^{23}cm^{-2}). Consequently, we propose this source as a new member of the\nclass of \"changing look\" AGN, i.e. AGN that have been observed both in\nCompton-thin (NH =10^{23 cm^{-2}) and reflection dominated states\n(Compton-thick, NH >10^{24} cm^{-2}). Due to the quite long time lag (6 months)\nbetween the Suzaku and XMM-Newton observations we cannot infer the possible\nlocation of the obscuring material causing the observed variability. In the 6-7\nkeV range the XMM-Newton observation also shows a clear signature of the\npresence of an ionized absorber. Since this feature is not detected during the\nSuzaku observation (despite its detectability), the simplest interpretation is\nthat the ionized absorber is also variable; its location is estimated to be\nwithin ~10^{-3} pc from the central black hole, probably much closer in than\nthe rather neutral absorber.\n", "  We review the exact treatment of the pairing correlation functions in the\ncanonical ensemble. The key for the calculations has been provided by relating\nthe discrete BCS model to known integrable theories corresponding to the so\ncalled Gaudin magnets with suitable boundary terms. In the present case the\ncorrelation functions can be accessed beyond the formal level, allowing the\ndescription of the cross-over from few electrons to the thermodynamic limit. In\nparticular, we summarize the results on the finite size scaling behavior of the\ncanonical pairing clarifying some puzzles emerged in the past. Some recent\ndevelopments and applications are outlined.\n", "  We investigate the unique properties of various analytical optical modes,\nincluding the fundamental modes and the excited modes, in a double-channel\nwaveguide with parity-time (PT) symmetry. Based on these optical modes, the\ndependence of the threshold values for the gain/loss parameter, i.e., PT\nsymmetry breaking points, on the structure parameters is discussed. We find\nthat the threshold value for the excited modes is larger than that of the\nfundamental mode. In addition, the beam dynamics in the double-channel\nwaveguide with PT symmetry is also investigated.\n", "  The first measurements of the coherence factor R_{K_S^0K\\pi} and the average\nstrong--phase difference \\delta^{K_S^0K\\pi} in D^0 \\to K_S^0 K^\\mp\\pi^\\pm\ndecays are reported. These parameters can be used to improve the determination\nof the unitary triangle angle \\gamma\\ in B^- \\rightarrow $\\widetilde{D}K^-$\ndecays, where $\\widetilde{D}$ is either a D^0 or a D^0-bar meson decaying to\nthe same final state, and also in studies of charm mixing. The measurements of\nthe coherence factor and strong-phase difference are made using\nquantum-correlated, fully-reconstructed D^0D^0-bar pairs produced in e^+e^-\ncollisions at the \\psi(3770) resonance. The measured values are R_{K_S^0K\\pi} =\n0.70 \\pm 0.08 and \\delta^{K_S^0K\\pi} = (0.1 \\pm 15.7)$^\\circ$ for an\nunrestricted kinematic region and R_{K*K} = 0.94 \\pm 0.12 and \\delta^{K*K} =\n(-16.6 \\pm 18.4)$^\\circ$ for a region where the combined K_S^0 \\pi^\\pm\ninvariant mass is within 100 MeV/c^2 of the K^{*}(892)^\\pm mass. These results\nindicate a significant level of coherence in the decay. In addition, isobar\nmodels are presented for the two decays, which show the dominance of the\nK^*(892)^\\pm resonance. The branching ratio {B}(D^0 \\rightarrow\nK_S^0K^+\\pi^-)/{B}(D^0 \\rightarrow K_S^0K^-\\pi^+) is determined to be 0.592 \\pm\n0.044 (stat.) \\pm 0.018 (syst.), which is more precise than previous\nmeasurements.\n", "  The autocorrelation function of the Langevin force in the model introduced in\nthe cited paper is calculated and verified to be correct.\n", "  We study the asymptotic long-range behavior of the time-dependent correlation\nfunction of the surface charge density induced on the interface between two\nmedia of distinct dielectric functions which are in thermal equilibrium with\none another as well as with the radiated electromagnetic field. We start with a\nshort review which summarizes the results obtained by using quantum and\nclassical descriptions of media, in both non-retarded and retarded regimes of\nparticle interactions. The classical static result for the flat interface is\nrederived by using a combination of the microscopic linear response theory and\nthe macroscopic method of electrostatic image charges. The method is then\napplied to the case of a spherically shaped interface between media.\n", "  We demonstrate molecular beam growth of graphene on biotite mica substrates\nat temperatures below 1000{\\deg}C. As indicated by optical and atomic force\nmicroscopy, evaporation of carbon from a high purity solid-state source onto\nbiotite surface results in the formation of single-, bi-, and multilayer\ngraphene with size in the micrometer regime. Graphene grown directly on mica\nsurface is of very high crystalline quality with the defect density below the\nthreshold detectable by Raman spectroscopy. The interaction between graphene\nand the mica substrate is studied by comparison of the Raman spectroscopy and\natomic force microscopy data with the corresponding results obtained for\ngraphene flakes mechanically exfoliated onto biotite substrates. Experimental\ninsights are combined with density functional theory calculations to propose a\nmodel for the initial stage of the van der Waals growth of graphene on mica\nsurfaces. This work provides important hints on how the direct growth of high\nquality graphene on insulators can be realized in general without exceeding the\nthermal budget limitations of Si technologies.\n", "  We present a new strong lensing mass reconstruction of the Bullet cluster (1E\n0657-56) at z=0.296, based on WFC3 and ACS HST imaging and VLT/FORS2\nspectroscopy. The strong lensing constraints underwent substantial revision\ncompared to previously published analysis, there are now 14 (six new and eight\npreviously known) multiply-imaged systems, of which three have\nspectroscopically confirmed redshifts (including one newly measured from this\nwork). The reconstructed mass distribution explicitly included the combination\nof three mass components: i) the intra-cluster gas mass derived from X-ray\nobservation, ii) the cluster galaxies modeled by their fundamental plane\nscaling relations and iii) dark matter. The model that includes the\nintra-cluster gas is the one with the best Bayesian evidence. This model has a\ntotal RMS value of 0.158\" between the predicted and measured image positions\nfor the 14 multiple images considered. The proximity of the total RMS to\nresolution of HST/WFC3 and ACS (0.07-0.15\" FWHM) demonstrates the excellent\nprecision of our mass model. The derived mass model confirms the spatial offset\nbetween the X-ray gas and dark matter peaks. The fraction of the galaxy halos\nmass to total mass is found to be f_s=11+/-5% for a total mass of 2.5+/-0.1 x\n10^14 solar mass within a 250 kpc radial aperture.\n", "  We analyse multiwavelength observations of an M2.9/1N flare that occurred in\nAR NOAA 11112 on 16 October 2010. AIA 211 {\\AA} EUV images reveal the presence\nof a faster coronal wave (decelerating from ~1390 to ~830 km/s) propagating\nahead of a slower wave (decelerating from ~416 to ~166 km/s) towards the\nwestern limb. The dynamic radio spectrum from Sagamore Hill radio telescope\nshows the presence of metric type II radio burst, which reveals the presence of\na coronal shock wave (speed~800 km/s). The speed of the faster coronal wave\nderived from AIA 211 {\\AA} images is found to be comparable to the coronal\nshock speed. AIA 171 {\\AA} high-cadence observations showed that a coronal\nloop, which was located at the distance of ~0.32 Rs to the west of the flaring\nregion, started to oscillate by the end of the impulsive phase of the flare.\nThe results indicate that the faster coronal wave may be the first driver of\nthe transversal oscillations of coronal loop. As the slower wave passed through\nthe coronal loop, the oscillations became even stronger. There was a plasmoid\neruption observed in EUV and a white-light CME was recorded, having velocity of\n~340-350 km/s. STEREO 195 {\\AA} images show an EIT wave, propagating in the\nsame direction of the lower-speed coronal wave observed in AIA, but\ndecelerating from ~320 to ~254 km/s. These observations reveal the co-existence\nof both waves (i.e. coronal Moreton and EIT waves), and type II radio burst\nseems to be associated with the coronal Moreton wave.\n", "  An Adaptive Mesh Refinement cosmological resimulation is analyzed in order to\ntest whether filamentary flows of cold gas are responsible for the build-up of\nangular momentum within a Milky Way like disk at z>=3. A set of algorithms is\npresented that takes advantage of the high spatial resolution of the simulation\n(12 pc) to identify: (i) the central gas disk and its plane of orientation;\n(ii) the complex individual filament trajectories that connect to the disk,\nand; (iii) the infalling satellites. The results show that two filaments at\nz>5.5, which later merge to form a single filament at z<4, drive the angular\nmomentum and mass budget of the disk throughout its evolution, whereas luminous\nsatellite mergers make negligible fractional contributions. Combined with the\nubiquitous presence of such filaments in all large-scale cosmological\nsimulations that include hydrodynamics, these findings provide strong\nquantitative evidence that the growth of thin disks in haloes with masses below\n10^{12} M_{sun}, which host the vast majority of galaxies, is supported via\ninflowing streams of cold gas at intermediate and high redshifts.\n", "  We design and optimize a waveguide structure consisted of three segments of\nPT-symmetric coupler. It can amplify the difference mode with the attenuation\nof the sum mode, so performs an asymmetric optical amplifier. Also, the\ndependence of the amplification factor for the difference mode and the\nattenuation factor for the sum mode on the gain/loss is illustrated.\n", "  Using mainly numerical methods, we investigate the width of the spin gap of a\nspin-1/2 two-leg ladder described by $\\cH= J_\\rl \\sum_{j=1}^{N/2} [ \\vS_{j,a}\n\\cdot \\vS_{j+1,a} + \\vS_{j,b} \\cdot \\vS_{j+1,b} ] + J_\\rr \\sum_{j=1}^{N/2}\n[\\lambda (S^x_{j,a} S^x_{j,b} + S^y_{j,a} S^y_{j,b}) + S^z_{j,a} S^z_{j,b}] $,\nwhere $S^\\alpha_{j,a(b)}$ denotes the $\\alpha$-component of the spin-1/2\noperator at the $j$-th site of the $a (b)$ chain. We mainly focus on the $J_\\rr\n\\gg J_\\rl > 0$ and $|\\lambda| \\ll 1$ case. The width of the spin gap as a\nfunction of $\\lambda$ anomalously increases near $\\lambda = 0$; for instance,\nfor $-0.1 < \\lambda < 0.1$ when $J_{\\rm l}/J_{\\rm r} = 0.1$. The gap formation\nmechanism is thought to be different for the $\\lambda < 0$ and $\\lambda > 0$\ncases. Since, in usual cases, the width of the gap becomes zero or small at the\npoint where the gap formation mechanism changes, the above gap-increasing\nphenomenon in the present case is anomalous. We explain the origin of this\nanomalous phenomenon by use of the degenerate perturbation theory. We also draw\nthe ground-state phase diagram.\n", "  We have obtained deep J & Ks-band images centered on a bright radio quiet QSO\nUM402 (z_{em}=2.856) using IRCS camera and AO systems on Subaru Telescope, as\nwell as retrieved WFC3/F140W archive images. A faint galaxy (m_{k}=23.32 +/-\n0.05 in the Vega system) that lies ~ 2.4\" north of the QSO sightline has been\nclearly resolved in all three deep high resolution datasets, and appears as an\nirregular galaxy with two close components in the Ks-band images (separation ~\n0.3\"). Given the small impact parameter (b=19.6 kpc, at z_{lls}=2.531), as well\nas the red color of (J-Ks)_{vega} ~ 1.6, it might be a candidate galaxy giving\nrise to the Lyman Limit system absorption at z_{abs}=2.531 seen in the QSO\nspectrum. After carefully subtracting the PSF from the QSO images, the host\ngalaxy of this bright radio quiet QSO at z ~ 3 was marginally revealled. We\nplaced a low limit of the host component of m_{k} ~ 23.3 according to our\nanalyses.\n", "  An earlier model for substrate strain mediated interactions between monomer\nadatoms is extended to the interaction of monomers with dimers and the\ninteraction of dimers. While monomers (sitting on high symmetric sites) are\nsupposed to create isotropic stress on the substrate, dimers would create\nanisotropic stress caused by stretching their bond. Resulting interactions are\nstrongly angle dependent and also reflect the elastic anisotropy of the\nsubstrate. The applicability of a continuum elastic model and its limitations\nare discussed. Consequences for modelling adatom structures are sketched\nwithout detailed analysis.\n", "  In ecology, prey switching refers to a predator's adaptive change of habitat\nor diet in response to prey abundance. In this paper, we study piecewise-smooth\nmodels of predator-prey interactions with a linear trade-off in a predator's\nprey preference. We consider optimally foraging predators and derive a model\nfor a 1 predator-2 prey interaction with a tilted switching manifold between\nthe two sides of discontinuous vector fields. We show that the 1 predator-2\nprey system undergoes a novel adding-sliding-like (center to two-part periodic\norbit; \"C2PO\") bifurcation in which the prey ratio transitions from constant to\ntime-dependent. Further away from the bifurcation point, the period of the\noscillating prey ratio period doubles, suggesting a possible cascade to chaos.\nWe compare our model predictions with data and demonstrate that we successfully\ncapture the periodicity in the ratio between the predator's preferred and\nalternative prey types in data on freshwater plankton. Our study suggests that\nit is useful to investigate prey ratio as a possible indicator of how\npopulation dynamics can be influenced by ecosystem diversity.\n", "  Microwave and submillimeter molecular transition frequencies between nearly\ndegenerated rotational levels, tunneling transitions, and mixed\ntunneling-rotational transitions show an extremely high sensitivity to the\nvalues of the fine-structure constant, alpha, and the electron-to-proton mass\nratio, mu. This review summarizes the theoretical background on\nquantum-mechanical calculations of the sensitivity coefficients of such\ntransitions to tiny changes in alpha and mu for a number of molecules which are\nusually observed in Galactic and extragalactic sources, and discusses the\npossibility of testing the space- and time-invariance of fundamental constants\nthrough comparison between precise laboratory measurements of the molecular\nrest frequencies and their astronomical counterparts. In particular, diatomic\nradicals CH, OH, NH+, and a linear polyatomic radical C3H in Pi electronic\nground state, polyatomic molecules NH3, ND3, NH2D, NHD2, H2O2, H3O+, CH3OH, and\nCH3NH2 in their tunneling and tunneling-rotational modes are considered. It is\nshown that sensitivity coefficients strongly depend on the quantum numbers of\nthe corresponding transitions. This can be used for astrophysical tests of\nEinstein's Equivalence Principle all over the Universe at an unprecedented\nlevel of sensitivity of ~10^-9, which is a limit three to two orders of\nmagnitude lower as compared to the current constraints on cosmological\nvariations of alpha and mu: Delta alpha/alpha < 10^-6, Delta mu/mu < 10^-7.\n", "  We have assembled a tiled array (220 cm2) of fine pixel (0.6 mm) imaging CZT\ndetectors for a balloon borne wide-field hard X-ray telescope, ProtoEXIST2.\nProtoEXIST2 is a prototype experiment for a next generation hard X-ray imager\nMIRAX-HXI on board Lattes, a spacecraft from the Agencia Espacial Brasilieira.\nMIRAX will survey the 5 to 200 keV sky of Galactic bulge, adjoining southern\nGalactic plane and the extragalactic sky with 6' angular resolution. This\nsurvey will open a vast discovery space in timing studies of accretion neutron\nstars and black holes. The ProtoEXIST2 CZT detector plane consists of 64 of 5\nmm thick 2 cm x 2 cm CZT crystals tiled with a minimal gap. MIRAX will consist\nof 4 such detector planes, each of which will be imaged with its own\ncoded-aperture mask. We present the packaging architecture and assembly\nprocedure of the ProtoEXIST2 detector. On 2012, Oct 10, we conducted a\nsuccessful high altitude balloon experiment of the ProtoEXIST1 and 2\ntelescopes, which demonstrates their technology readiness for space\napplication. During the flight both telescopes performed as well as on the\nground. We report the results of ground calibration and the initial results for\nthe detector performance in the balloon flight.\n", "  The aim of the paper is to derive the exact analytical expressions for\ntorsion and bending creep of rods with the Norton-Bailey, Garofalo and\nNaumenko-Altenbach-Gorash constitutive models. These simple constitutive\nmodels, for example, the time- and strain-hardening constitutive equations,\nwere based on adaptations for time-varying stress of equally simple models for\nthe secondary creep stage from constant load/stress uniaxial tests where\nminimum creep rate is constant. The analytical solution is studied for\nNorton-Bailey and Garofalo laws in uniaxial states of stress. The most common\nsecondary creep constitutive model has been the Norton-Bailey Law which gives a\npower law relationship between minimum creep rate and (constant) stress. The\ndistinctive mathematical properties of the power law allowed the development of\nanalytical methods, many of which can be found in high temperature design\ncodes. The results of creep simulation are applied to practically important\nproblem of engineering, namely for simulation of creep and relaxation of\nhelical and disk springs. The exact analyticalexpressions giving the torque and\nbending moment as a function of the time were derived.\n", "  We present an implementation of the manifest left-right symmetric model in\nFeynRules. The different aspects of the model are briefly described alongside\nthe corresponding elements of the model file. The model file is validated and\ncan be easily translated to matrix element generators such as\nMadGraph5_aMC@NLO, CalcHEP, Sherpa, etc. The implementation of the left-right\nsymmetric model is a useful step for studying new physics signals with the data\ngenerated at the LHC.\n", "  The problem of the two-point resistance in various networks has recently\nreceived considerable attention. Here we consider the problem on a fan-resistor\nnetwork, which is a segment of the cobweb network. Using a recently developed\napproach, we obtain the exact resistance between two arbitrary nodes on such a\nnetwork. As a byproduct, the analysis also delivers the solution of the\nspanning tree problem on the fan network.\n", "  We present an updated version of the so-called Madau model for the\nattenuation by the intergalactic neutral hydrogen against the radiation from\ndistant objects. First, we derive a distribution function of the intergalactic\nabsorbers from the latest observational statistics of the Ly$\\alpha$ forest,\nLyman limit systems, and damped Ly$\\alpha$ systems. The distribution function\nexcellently reproduces the observed redshift evolutions of the Ly$\\alpha$\ndepression and of the mean-free-path of the Lyman continuum simultaneously.\nThen, we derive a set of the analytic functions which describe the mean\nintergalactic attenuation curve for objects at $z>0.5$. The new model predicts\nless (or more) Ly$\\alpha$ attenuation for $z\\simeq3$--5 ($z>6$) sources through\nusual broad-band filters relative to the original Madau model. This may cause a\nsystematic difference in the photometric redshift estimates, which is, however,\nstill as small as about 0.05. Finally, we find a more than 0.5 mag\noverestimation of the Lyman continuum attenuation in the original Madau model\nat $z>3$, which causes a significant overcorrection against direct observations\nof the Lyman continuum of galaxies.\n", "  Anomalous surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) peaks are identified for\nliquid sample stored in polypropylene centrifuge tubes (PP tube) for months. We\nobserved the unexpected Raman peaks during experiments for Thiamine\nHydrochloride aqueous solution stored in PP tube for two months. In order to\nidentify the contaminants we have performed SERS experiments for de-ionized\nwater (DI water) stored in polypropylene centrifuge tube for two months and\ncompared them with fresh DI water sample. We have also carried out Ultra Violet\n(UV) absorption spectra for both fresh and contaminated water. We believe that\nthe water is contaminated because of chemicals leaching from the PP tube. From\nthe GC-MS data the main contaminant was found to be Phthalic acid and its\nderivatives. Further SERS and UV absorption experiment for Phthalic acid\ncorrelates well with the anomalous peaks identified earlier. We qualitatively\nconfirmed the identification and quantitatively estimated the concentration of\nsuspect contaminants as between 1uM and 10uM with both SERS and UV absorption\nspectroscopy. With UV absorption spectroscopy, we precisely estimate the\nconcentration as 2.1uM. We have shown that sample in PP tube can be\ncontaminated due to leaching chemicals upon long term storage and suggested\nSERS and UV-absorption spectroscopy as two quick and simple techniques to\ndetect the contamination\n", "  We consider (a) the partition functions of the anisotropic dimer model on the\nrectangular (2M-1) x (2N-1) lattice with free and cylindrical boundary\nconditions with a single monomer residing on the boundary and (b) the partition\nfunction of the anisotropic spanning tree on an M x N rectangular lattice with\nfree boundary conditions. We express (a) and (b) in terms of a principal\npartition function with twisted boundary conditions. Based on these\nexpressions, we derive the exact asymptotic expansions of the free energy for\nboth cases (a) and (b). We confirm the conformal field theory prediction for\nthe corner free energy of these models, and find the central charge is c = - 2.\nWe also show that the dimer model on the cylinder with an odd number of sites\non the perimeter exhibits the same finite-size corrections as on the plane.\n", "  We study gravity duals to a broad class of N=2 supersymmetric gauge theories\ndefined on a general class of three-manifold geometries. The gravity\nbackgrounds are based on Euclidean self-dual solutions to four-dimensional\ngauged supergravity. As well as constructing new examples, we prove in general\nthat for solutions defined on the four-ball the gravitational free energy\ndepends only on the supersymmetric Killing vector, finding a simple closed\nformula when the solution has U(1) x U(1) symmetry. Our result agrees with the\nlarge N limit of the free energy of the dual gauge theory, computed using\nlocalization. This constitutes an exact check of the gauge/gravity\ncorrespondence for a very broad class of gauge theories with a large N limit,\ndefined on a general class of background three-manifold geometries.\n", "  We present a path integral Monte Carlo study of the global superfluid\nfraction and local superfluid density in cylindrically-symmetric reservoirs of\nliquid $^{4}$He separated by nanoaperture arrays. The superfluid response to\nboth translations along the axis of symmetry (longitudinal response) and\nrotations about the cylinder axis (transverse response) are computed, together\nwith radial and axial density distributions that reveal the microscopic\ninhomogeneity arising from the combined effects of the confining external\npotential and the $^4$He-$^4$He interatomic potentials. We make a microscopic\ndetermination of the length-scale of decay of superfluidity at the radial\nboundaries of the system by analyzing the local superfluid density distribution\nto extract a displacement length that quantifies the superfluid mass\ndisplacement away from the boundary. We find that the longitudinal superfluid\nresponse is reduced in reservoirs separated by a septum containing sufficiently\nsmall apertures compared to a cylinder with no intervening aperture array, for\nall temperatures below $T_{\\lambda}$. For a single aperture in the septum, a\nsignificant drop in the longitudinal superfluid response is seen when the\naperture diameter is made smaller than twice the empirical\ntemperature-dependent $^4$He healing length, consistent with the formation of a\nweak link between the reservoirs. Increasing the diameter of a single aperture\nor the number of apertures in the array results in an increase of the\nsuperfluid density toward the expected bulk value.\n", "  For $J/\\psi$ pair production at hadron colliders, we present the full\nnext-to-leading order (NLO) calculations with the color-singlet channel in\nnonrelativistic QCD. We find that the NLO result can reasonably well describe\nthe LHCb measured cross section, but exhibits very different behaviors from the\nCMS data in the transverse momentum distribution and mass distribution of\n$J/\\psi$ pair. Moreover, by adding contributions of gluon fragmentation and\nquark fragmentation, which occur at even higher order in $\\alpha_s$, it is\nstill unable to reduce the big differences. In particular, the observed flat\ndistribution in the large invariant mass region is hard to explain. New\nprocesses or mechanisms are needed to understand the CMS data for $J/\\psi$ pair\nproduction.\n", "  We analyze doubly magic trapping of Cs hyperfine transitions including\npreviously neglected contributions from the ground state hyperpolarizability\nand the interaction of the laser light and a static magnetic field. Extensive\nnumerical searches do not reveal any doubly magic trapping conditions for any\npair of hyperfine states. However, including the hyperpolarizability reveals\nlight intensity insensitive traps for a wide range of wavelengths at specific\nintensities. We then investigate the possibility of using bichromatic trapping\nlight fields. Deploying a bichromatic scheme, we demonstrate doubly magic red\nand blue detuned traps for pairs of states separated by one or two single\nphoton transitions.\n", "  The quantum Heisenberg model is studied in the geometrically frustrated\nbody-centered tetragonal lattice(BCT lattice) with antiferromagnetic interlayer\ncoupling J1 and intralayer first and second neighbor coupling J2 and J3. We\nintroduce a variational method: each interaction term can be decoupled\npartially in the purely magnetic Weiss and in the spin-liquid (SL) mean-field\nchannels. We find that the most stable variational solutions correspond to the\nthree different possible long range magnetic orders that are respectively\ngoverned by J1, J2, and J3. We characterize three different purely SL\nnon-magnetic solutions that are variationally the second most stable states\nafter the purely magnetic ones. This suggests that quantum fluctuations induced\nby the frustration between J1-J2-J3 coupling should destroy magnetic orders and\nstabilize the formation of SL in large areas of parameters. The SL solution\ngoverned by J1 breaks the lattice translation symmetry. This Modulated SL is\nassociated to a commensurate ordering wave vector (1,1,1). We discuss the\nrelevance of our results for heavy fermion Uru2Si2 and cuprate superconductors\nthat have a BCT lattice structure. Also, the general variational method\nintroduced here can be applied to any other system where interaction terms can\nbe decoupled in two different mean-field channels.\n", "  We present the first reconstruction of the star formation history (SFH) of\nthe Large and Small Magellanic Clouds (LMC and SMC) using Long Period Variable\nstars. These cool evolved stars reach their peak luminosity in the\nnear-infrared; thus, their K-band magnitudes can be used to derive their birth\nmass and age, and hence the SFH can be obtained. In the LMC, we found a 10-Gyr\nold single star formation epoch at a rate of $\\sim1.5$ M$_\\odot$ yr$^{-1}$,\nfollowed by a relatively continuous SFR of $\\sim0.2$ M$_\\odot$ yr$^{-1}$,\nglobally. In the core of the LMC (LMC bar), a secondary, distinct episode is\nseen, starting 3 Gyr ago and lasting until $\\sim0.5$ Gyr ago. In the SMC, two\nformation epochs are seen, one $\\sim6$ Gyr ago at a rate of $\\sim0.28$\nM$_\\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ and another only $\\sim0.7$ Gyr ago at a rate of $\\sim0.3$\nM$_\\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. The latter is also discernible in the LMC and may thus be\nlinked to the interaction between the Magellanic Clouds and/or Milky Way, while\nthe formation of the LMC bar may have been an unrelated event. Star formation\nactivity is concentrated in the central parts of the Magellanic Clouds now, and\npossibly has always been if stellar migration due to dynamical relaxation has\nbeen effective. The different initial formation epochs suggest that the LMC and\nSMC did not form as a pair, but at least the SMC formed in isolation.\n", "  For highly compact neutron stars, constructing numerical initial data for\nblack hole-neutron star binary evolutions is very difficult. We describe\nimprovements to an earlier method that enable it to handle these more\nchallenging cases. We examine the case of a 6:1 mass ratio system in inspiral\nclose to merger, where the star is governed by a polytropic $\\Gamma=2$, an SLy,\nor an LS220 equation of state. In particular, we are able to obtain a solution\nwith a realistic LS220 equation of state for a star with compactness 0.26 and\nmass 1.98 $M_\\odot$, which is representative of the highest reliably determined\nneutron star masses. For the SLy equation of state, we can obtain solutions\nwith a comparable compactness of 0.25, while for a family of polytropic\nequations of state, we obtain solutions with compactness up to 0.21, the\nlargest compactness that is stable in this family. These compactness values are\nsignificantly higher than any previously published results. We find that\nimprovements in adapting the computational domain to the neutron star surface\nand in accounting for the center of mass drift of the system are the key\ningredients allowing us to obtain these solutions.\n", "  We express the partition functions of the spanning tree on finite square\nlattices under five different sets of boundary conditions (free, cylindrical,\ntoroidal, M\\\"obius strip, and Klein bottle) in terms of a principal partition\nfunction with twisted boundary conditions. Based on these expressions, we\nderive the exact asymptotic expansions of the logarithm of the partition\nfunction for each case. We have also established several groups of identities\nrelating spanning-tree partition functions for the different boundary\nconditions. We also explain an apparent discrepancy between logarithmic\ncorrection terms in the free energy for a two dimensional spanning tree model\nwith periodic and free boundary conditions and conformal field theory\npredictions. We have obtain corner free energy for the spanning tree under free\nboundary conditions in full agreement with conformal field theory predictions.\n", "  Networked entanglement is an essential component for a plethora of quantum\ncomputation and communication protocols. Direct transmission of quantum signals\nover long distances is prevented by fibre attenuation and the no-cloning\ntheorem, motivating the development of quantum repeaters, designed to purify\nentanglement, extending its range. Quantum repeaters have been demonstrated\nover short distances, but error-corrected, global repeater networks with high\nbandwidth require new technology. Here we show that error corrected quantum\nmemories installed in cargo containers and carried by ship can provide a\nflexible connection between local networks, enabling low-latency, high-fidelity\nquantum communication across global distances at higher bandwidths than\npreviously proposed. With demonstrations of technology with sufficient fidelity\nto enable topological error-correction, implementation of the quantum memories\nis within reach, and bandwidth increases with improvements in fabrication. Our\napproach to quantum networking avoids technological restrictions of repeater\ndeployment, providing an alternate path to a worldwide Quantum Internet.\n", "  We consider the Schr\\\"odinger equation with a Hamiltonian given by a second\norder difference operator with nonconstant growing coefficients, on the half\none dimensional lattice. This operator appeared first naturally in the\nconstruction and dynamics of noncommutative solitons in the context of\nnoncommutative field theory. We prove pointwise in time decay estimates, with\nthe optimal decay rate $t^{-1}\\log^{-2}t$ generically. We use a novel technique\ninvolving generating functions of orthogonal polynomials to achieve this\nestimate.\n", "  We consider the Schr\\\"odinger equation with a Hamiltonian given by a second\norder difference operator with nonconstant growing coefficients, on the half\none dimensional lattice. This operator appeared first naturally in the\nconstruction and dynamics of noncommutative solitons in the context of\nnoncommutative field theory. We construct a ground state soliton for this\nequation and analyze its properties. In particular we arrive at $\\ell^{\\infty}$\nand $\\ell^{1}$ estimates as well as a quasi-exponential spatial decay rate.\n", "  The functional relation between the fractional band-width and the quality\nfactor of a radiating system is investigated in this note. Several widely used\ndefinitions of the quality factor are compared on two examples of RLC circuits\nthat serve as a simplified model of a single resonant antenna tuned to its\nresonance. It is demonstrated that for a first-order system, only the quality\nfactor based on differentiation of input impedance has unique proportionality\nto the fractional bandwidth, whereas e.g. the classical definition of the\nquality factor, i. e. the ratio of the stored energy to the lost energy per one\ncycle, is not uniquely proportional to the fractional bandwidth. In addition,\nit is shown that for higher-order systems the quality factor based on\ndifferentiation of the input impedance ceases to be uniquely related to the\nfractional bandwidth.\n", "  The realization of Majorana zero modes is in the centre of intense\ntheoretical and experimental investigations. Unfortunately, their exchange that\ncan reveal their exotic statistics needs manipulations that are still beyond\nour experimental capabilities. Here we take an alternative approach. Through\nthe Jordan-Wigner transformation, the Kitaev's chain supporting two Majorana\nzero modes is mapped to the spin-1/2 chain. We experimentally simulated the\nspin system and its evolution with a photonic quantum simulator. This allows us\nto probe the geometric phase, which corresponds to the exchange of two Majorana\nzero modes positioned at the ends of a three-site chain. Finally, we\ndemonstrate the immunity of quantum information encoded in the Majorana zero\nmodes against local errors through the simulator. Our photonic simulator opens\nthe way for the efficient realization and manipulation of Majorana zero modes\nin complex architectures.\n", "  Frequency domain Mie solutions to scattering from spheres have been used for\na long time. However, deriving their transient analogue is a challenge as it\ninvolves an inverse Fourier transform of the spherical Hankel functions (and\ntheir derivatives) that are convolved with inverse Fourier transforms of\nspherical Bessel functions (and their derivatives). Series expansion of these\nconvolutions are highly oscillatory (therefore, poorly convergent) and\nunstable. Indeed, the literature on numerical computation of this convolution\nis very sparse. In this paper, we present a novel quasi-analytical approach to\ncomputing transient Mie scattering that is both stable and rapidly convergent.\nThe approach espoused here is to use vector tesseral harmonics as basis\nfunction for the currents in time domain integral equations together with a\nnovel addition theorem for the Green's functions that renders these expansions\nstable. This procedure results in an orthogonal, spatially-meshfree and\nsingularity-free system, giving us a set of one dimensional Volterra Integral\nequations. Time-dependent multipole coefficients for each mode are obtained via\na time marching procedure. Finally, several numerical examples are presented to\nshow the accuracy and stability the proposed method.\n", "  We discuss the universality and self-similarity of void density profiles, for\nvoids in realistic mock luminous red galaxy (LRG) catalogues from the Jubilee\nsimulation, as well as in void catalogues constructed from the SDSS LRG and\nMain Galaxy samples. Voids are identified using a modified version of the ZOBOV\nwatershed transform algorithm, with additional selection cuts. We find that\nvoids in simulation are self-similar, meaning that their average rescaled\nprofile does not depend on the void size, or -- within the range of the\nsimulated catalogue -- on the redshift. Comparison of the profiles obtained\nfrom simulated and real voids shows an excellent match. The profiles of real\nvoids also show a universal behaviour over a wide range of galaxy luminosities,\nnumber densities and redshifts. This points to a fundamental property of the\nvoids found by the watershed algorithm, which can be exploited in future\nstudies of voids.\n", "  To probe the charge scattering mechanism in Cd$_{3}$As$_{2}$ single crystal,\nwe have analyzed the temperature and magnetic field dependence of the Seebeck\ncoefficient ($S$). The large saturation value of $S$ at high field clearly\ndemonstrates the linear energy dispersion of three-dimensional Dirac fermion. A\nwide tunability of the charge scattering mechanism has been realized by varying\nthe strength of the magnetic field and carrier density via In doping. With the\nincrease in magnetic field, the scattering time crosses over from being nearly\nenergy independent to a regime of linear dependence. On the other hand, the\nscattering time enters into the inverse energy-dependent regime and the Fermi\nsurface strongly modifies with 2\\% In doping at Cd site. With further increase\nin In content from 2 to 4\\%, we did not observe any Shubnikov-de Haas\noscillation up to 9 T field, but the magnetoresistance is found to be quite\nlarge as in the case of undoped sample.\n", "  The squash operation, or the squashing model, is a useful mathematical tool\nfor proving the security of quantum key distribution systems using practical\n(i.e., non-ideal) detectors. At the present, however, this method can only be\napplied to a limited class of detectors, such as the threshold detector of the\nBennett-Brassard 1984 type. In this paper we generalize this method to include\nmulti-partite measurements, such that it can be applied to a wider class of\ndetectors. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this generalization by applying\nit to the device-independent security proof of the Ekert 1991 protocol, and by\nimproving the associated key generation rate. For proving this result we use\ntwo physical assumptions, namely, that quantum mechanics is valid, and that\nAlice's and Bob's detectors are memoryless.\n", "  The hypothesis of a discrete fabric of the universe--the \"Planck scale\"--is\nalways on stage, since it solves mathematical and conceptual problems in the\ninfinitely small. However, it clashes with special relativity, which is\ndesigned for the continuum. Here we show how the clash can be overcome within a\ndiscrete quantum theory where the evolution of fields is described by a quantum\ncellular automaton. The reconciliation is achieved by defining the change of\nobserver as a change of representation of the dynamics, without any reference\nto space-time. We use the relativity principle, i.e. the invariance of dynamics\nunder change of inertial observer, to identify a change of inertial frame with\na symmetry of the dynamics. We consider the full group of such symmetries, and\nrecover the usual Lorentz group in the relativistic regime of low energies,\nwhile at the Planck scale the covariance is nonlinearly distorted.\n", "  We present a general method to derive entanglement breaking (EB) conditions\nfor continuous-variable quantum gates. We start with an arbitrary entanglement\nwitness, and reach an EB condition. The resultant EB condition is applicable\nnot only for quantum channels but also for general quantum operations, namely,\ntrace-non-increasing class of completely positive maps. We illustrate our\nmethod associated with a quantum benchmark based on the input ensemble of\nGaussian distributed coherent states. We also exploit our idea for channels\nacting on finite dimensional systems and present a Schmidt-number benchmark\nbased on input states of two mutually unbiased bases and measurements of\ngeneralized Pauli operators.\n", "  We present new light curves covering 14 to 19 years of observations of four\nbright proto-planetary nebulae (PPNs), all O-rich and of F spectral type. They\neach display cyclical light curves with significant variations in amplitude.\nAll four were previously known to vary in light. Our data were combined with\npublished data and searched for periodicity. The results are as follows: IRAS\n19475+3119 (HD 331319; 41.0 days), 17436+5003 (HD 161796; 45.2 days),\n19386+0155 (101.8 days), and 18095+2704 (113.3 days). The two longer periods\nare in agreement with previous studies while the two shorter periods each\nreveal for the first time reveal a dominant period over these long observing\nintervals. Multiple periods were also found for each object. The secondary\nperiods were all close to the dominant periods, with P2/P1 ranging from 0.86 to\n1.06. The variations in color reveal maximum variations in T(eff) of 400 to 770\nK. These variations are due to pulsations in these post-AGB objects. Maximum\nseasonal light variations are all less than 0.23 mag (V), consistent for their\ntemperatures and periods with the results of Hrivnak et al. (2010) for 12\nC-rich PPNs. For all of these PPNs, there is an inverse relationship between\nperiod and temperature; however, there is a suggestion that the\nperiod-temperature relationship may be somewhat steeper for the O-rich than for\nthe C-rich PPNs.\n", "  The atomic-scale spin structure of individual isolated skyrmions in an\nultrathin film is investigated in real space by spin-polarized scanning\ntunneling microscopy. Their axial symmetry as well as their unique rotational\nsense is revealed by using both out-of-plane and in-plane sensitive tips. The\nsize and shape of skyrmions change as a function of magnetic field. An\nanalytical expression for the description of skyrmions is proposed and applied\nto connect the experimental data to the original theoretical model describing\nchiral skyrmions. Thereby, the relevant material parameters responsible for\nskyrmion formation can be obtained.\n", "  We study analytically the plasmonic modes in the graphene-coated dielectric\nnanowire, based on the explicit form of nonlinear surface conductivity of\ngraphene. The propagation constants of different plasmonic modes can be tuned\nby the input power at the order of a few tenths of mW. The lower and upper mode\nbifurcation branches are connected at the limitation value of the input power.\nMoreover, due to the nonlinearity of graphene, the dispersion curves of\nplasmonic modes at different input powers form an energy band, which is in\nsharp contrast with the single dispersion curve in the limit of zero input\npower.\n", "  We evaluate the advantages of performing cross-phase modulation (XPM) on a\nvery-far-off-resonance atomic system. We consider a ladder system with a weak\n(few-photon level) control coherent field imparting a conditional nonlinear\nphase shift on a probe beam. We find that by coupling to an optical resonator\nthe optimal XPM is enhanced proportional to the finesse of the resonator by a\nfactor of $F/4\\pi$. We present a semi-classical description of the system and\nshow that the phenomenon is optimal in the self-defined condition of\noff-resonance-effective-cooperativity equal to one.\n", "  The response of glasses to mechanical loading often leads to the formation of\ninhomogeneous flow patterns that strongly affect materials properties. Among\nthem, shear bands are ubiquitous in a wide variety of materials, ranging from\nsoft matter systems to metallic alloys. Shear banding is associated with strain\nlocalization, i.e. the deformation of the sheared glassy solid is localized in\nspace in form of band-like structures. These structures are often precursors to\ncatastrophic failure, implying that a proper understanding of the underlying\nmechanisms could lead to the design of smarter materials. However, despite its\nimportance in material science, the microscopic origin of shear banding in\nglassy materials is only poorly understood. Here, the formation of shear\nbanding in glassy systems is revealed by non-equilibrium molecular dynamics\nsimulations (NEMD) of a binary Lennard-Jones mixture, subject to a constant\nstrain rate. In its glass state, this system exhibits for all considered strain\nrates the formation of a percolating cluster of mobile regions at a critical\nstrain. We show that this percolation transition belongs to the universality\nclass of directed percolation. Only at low shear rates, where the steady-state\nstress is close to the yielding threshold, the percolating cluster evolves into\na transient (but long-lived) shear band with a diffusive growth of its width.\n", "  The critical Ising model in two dimensions with a defect line is analyzed to\ndeliver the first exact solution with twisted boundary conditions. We derive\nexact expressions for the eigenvalues of the transfer matrix and obtain\nanalytically the partition function and the asymptotic expansions of the free\nenergy and inverse correlation lengths for an infinitely long cylinder of\ncircumference $L_x$. We find that finite-size corrections to scaling are of the\nform $a_k/L^{2k-1}_x$ for the free energy $f$ and $b_k(p)/L_x^{2k-1}$ and\n$c_k(p)/L_x^{2k-1}$ for inverse correlation lengths $\\xi^{-1}_p$ and\n$\\xi^{-1}_{L-p}$, respectively, with integer values of $k$. By exact evaluation\nwe find that the amplitude ratios $b_k(p)/a_k$ and $c_k(p)/a_k$ are universal\nand verify this universal behavior using a perturbative conformal approach.\n", "  We present the three-loop result for the soft anomalous dimension governing\nlong-distance singularities of multi-leg gauge-theory scattering amplitudes of\nmassless partons. We compute all contributing webs involving semi-infinite\nWilson lines at three loops and obtain the complete three-loop correction to\nthe dipole formula. We find that non-dipole corrections appear already for\nthree coloured partons, where the correction is a constant without kinematic\ndependence. Kinematic dependence appears only through conformally-invariant\ncross ratios for four coloured partons or more, and the result can be expressed\nin terms of single-valued harmonic polylogarithms of weight five. While the\nnon-dipole three-loop term does not vanish in two-particle collinear limits,\nits contribution to the splitting amplitude anomalous dimension reduces to a\nconstant, and it only depends on the colour charges of the collinear pair,\nthereby preserving strict collinear factorization properties. Finally we verify\nthat our result is consistent with expectations from the Regge limit.\n", "  Consider a two-party correlation that can be generated by performing local\nmeasurements on a bipartite quantum system. A question of fundamental\nimportance is to understand how many resources, which we quantify by the\ndimension of the underlying quantum system, are needed to reproduce this\ncorrelation. In this Letter, we identify an easy-to-compute lower bound on the\nsmallest Hilbert space dimension needed to generate a given two-party quantum\ncorrelation. We show that our bound is tight on many well-known correlations\nand discuss how it can rule out correlations of having a finite-dimensional\nquantum representation. We show that our bound is multiplicative under product\ncorrelations and also that it can witness the non-convexity of certain\nrestricted-dimensional quantum correlations.\n", "  Magnetic skyrmions are localised non-collinear spin textures with high\npotential for future spintronic applications. Skyrmion phases have been\ndiscovered in a number of materials and a focus of current research is the\npreparation, detection, and manipulation of individual skyrmions for an\nimplementation in devices. Local experimental characterization of skyrmions has\nbeen performed by, e.g., Lorentz microscopy or atomic-scale tunnel\nmagnetoresistance measurements using spin-polarised scanning tunneling\nmicroscopy. Here, we report on a drastic change of the differential tunnel\nconductance for magnetic skyrmions arising from their non-collinearity: mixing\nbetween the spin channels locally alters the electronic structure, making a\nskyrmion electronically distinct from its ferromagnetic environment. We propose\nthis non-collinear magnetoresistance (NCMR) as a reliable all-electrical\ndetection scheme for skyrmions with an easy implementation into device\narchitectures.\n", "  Spatially-varying depth and characteristics of observing conditions, such as\nseeing, airmass, or sky background, are major sources of systematic\nuncertainties in modern galaxy survey analyses, in particular in deep\nmulti-epoch surveys. We present a framework to extract and project these\nsources of systematics onto the sky, and apply it to the Dark Energy Survey\n(DES) to map the observing conditions of the Science Verification (SV) data.\nThe resulting distributions and maps of sources of systematics are used in\nseveral analyses of DES SV to perform detailed null tests with the data, and\nalso to incorporate systematics in survey simulations. We illustrate the\ncomplementarity of these two approaches by comparing the SV data with the\nBCC-UFig, a synthetic sky catalogue generated by forward-modelling of the DES\nSV images. We analyse the BCC-UFig simulation to construct galaxy samples\nmimicking those used in SV galaxy clustering studies. We show that the\nspatially-varying survey depth imprinted in the observed galaxy densities and\nthe redshift distributions of the SV data are successfully reproduced by the\nsimulation and well-captured by the maps of observing conditions. The combined\nuse of the maps, the SV data and the BCC-UFig simulation allows us to quantify\nthe impact of spatial systematics on $N(z)$, the redshift distributions\ninferred using photometric redshifts. We conclude that spatial systematics in\nthe SV data are mainly due to seeing fluctuations and are under control in\ncurrent clustering and weak lensing analyses. The framework presented here is\nrelevant to all multi-epoch surveys, and will be essential for exploiting\nfuture surveys such as the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST), which will\nrequire detailed null-tests and realistic end-to-end image simulations to\ncorrectly interpret the deep, high-cadence observations of the sky.\n", "  We introduce a method, dubbed the flux-fusion anomaly test, to detect certain\nanomalous symmetry fractionalization patterns in two-dimensional symmetry\nenriched topological (SET) phases. We focus on bosonic systems with Z2\ntopological order, and symmetry group of the form G = U(1) $\\rtimes$ G', where\nG' is an arbitrary group that may include spatial symmetries and/or time\nreversal. The anomalous fractionalization patterns we identify cannot occur in\nstrictly d=2 systems, but can occur at surfaces of d=3 symmetry protected\ntopological (SPT) phases. This observation leads to examples of d=3 bosonic\ntopological crystalline insulators (TCIs) that, to our knowledge, have not\npreviously been identified. In some cases, these d=3 bosonic TCIs can have an\nanomalous superfluid at the surface, which is characterized by non-trivial\nprojective transformations of the superfluid vortices under symmetry. The basic\nidea of our anomaly test is to introduce fluxes of the U(1) symmetry, and to\nshow that some fractionalization patterns cannot be extended to a consistent\naction of G' symmetry on the fluxes. For some anomalies, this can be described\nin terms of dimensional reduction to d=1 SPT phases. We apply our method to\nseveral different symmetry groups with non-trivial anomalies, including G =\nU(1) X Z2T and G = U(1) X Z2P, where Z2T and Z2P are time-reversal and d=2\nreflection symmetry, respectively.\n", "  We present HI 21cm emission observations of the z ~ 0.00632 sub-damped\nLyman-alpha absorber (sub-DLA) towards PG1216+069 made using the Arecibo\nTelescope and the Very Large Array (VLA). The Arecibo 21cm spectrum corresponds\nto an HI mass of ~ 3.2x10^7 solar masses, two orders of magnitude smaller than\nthat of a typical spiral galaxy. This is surprising since in the local Universe\nthe cross-section for absorption at high HI column densities is expected to be\ndominated by spirals. The 21cm emission detected in the VLA spectral cube has a\nlow signal-to-noise ratio, and represents only half the total flux seen at\nArecibo. Emission from three other sources is detected in the VLA observations,\nwith only one of these sources having an optical counterpart. This group of HI\nsources appears to be part of complex \"W\", believed to lie in the background of\nthe Virgo cluster. While several HI cloud complexes have been found in and\naround the Virgo cluster, it is unclear whether the ram pressure and galaxy\nharassment processes that are believed to be responsible for the creation of\nsuch clouds in a cluster environment are relevant at the location of this cloud\ncomplex. The extremely low metallicity of the gas, ~ 1/40 solar, also makes it\nunlikely that the sub-DLA consists of material that has been stripped from a\ngalaxy. Thus, while our results have significantly improved our understanding\nof the host of this sub-DLA, the origin of the gas cloud remains a mystery\n", "  One of the most intriguing aspects of Quantum Mechanics is the impossibility\nof measuring at the same time observables corresponding to non-commuting\noperators. This impossibility can be partially relaxed when considering joint\nor sequential weak values evaluation. Indeed, weak measurements have been a\nreal breakthrough in the quantum measurement framework that is of the utmost\ninterest from both a fundamental and an applicative point of view. Here we show\nhow we realized, for the first time, a sequential weak value evaluation of two\nincompatible observables on a single photon.\n", "  This paper deals with the generalization of usual round spheres in the flat\nMinkowski spacetime to the case of a generic four-dimensional spacetime\nmanifold $M$. We consider geometric properties of sphere-like submanifolds in\n$M$ and introduce conditions on external curvature and torsion, which lead to a\ndefinition of a {\\em rigid sphere}. The main result is a local existence\ntheorem concernig such spheres. For this purpose we apply the surjective\nimplicit function theorem. The proof is based on a detailed analysis of the\nlinearized problem and leads to an eight-parameter family of solutions in case\nwhen the metric tensor $g$ of $M$ is from a certain neighbourhood of the flat\nMinkowski metric. This contribution continues the study of rigid spheres in\n(Class. Quantum Grav. \\textbf{30} (2013), 175010,\ndoi:10.1088/0264-9381/30/17/175010, 18 pp.).\n", "  We present the distance priors that we have derived from the 2015 Planck\ndata, and use these in combination with the latest observational data from Type\nIa Supernovae (SNe Ia) and galaxy clustering, to explore the systematic\nuncertainties in dark energy constraints. We use the Joint Lightcurve Analysis\n(JLA) set of 740 SNe Ia, galaxy clustering measurements of H(z)s and D_A(z)/s\n(where s is the sound horizon at the drag epoch) from the Sloan Digital Sky\nSurvey (SDSS) at z=0.35 and z=0.57 (BOSS DR12). We find that the combined dark\nenergy constraints are insensitive to the assumptions made in the galaxy\nclustering measurements (whether they are for BAO only or marginalized over\nRSD), which indicates that as the analysis of galaxy clustering data becomes\nmore accurate and robust, the systematic uncertainties are reduced. On the\nother hand, we find that flux-averaging SNe Ia at z>= 0.5 significantly\ntightens the dark energy constraints, and excludes a flat universe with a\ncosmological constant at 68% confidence level, assuming a dark energy equation\nof state linear in the cosmic scale factor. Flux-averaging has the most\nsignificant effect when we allow dark energy density function X(z) to be a free\nfunctions given by the cubic spline of its value at z=0, 1/3, 2/3, 1; the\nmeasured X(z) deviates from a cosmological constant at more than 95% confidence\nlevel for 0.4 < z < 0.7. Since flux-averaging reduces the bias in the SN\ndistance measurements, this may be an indication that we have arrived in the\nera when the SN distance measurements are limited by systematic uncertainties.\n", "  Optical access networks connect multiple endpoints to a common network node\nvia shared fibre infrastructure. They will play a vital role to scale up the\nnumber of users in quantum key distribution (QKD) networks. However, the\npresence of power splitters in the commonly used passive network architecture\nmakes successful transmission of weak quantum signals challenging. This is\nespecially true if QKD and data signals are multiplexed in the passive network.\nThe splitter introduces an imbalance between quantum signal and Raman noise,\nwhich can prevent the recovery of the quantum signal completely. Here we\nintroduce a method to overcome this limitation and demonstrate coexistence of\nmulti-user QKD and full power data traffic from a gigabit passive optical\nnetwork (GPON). The dual feeder implementation is compatible with standard GPON\narchitectures and can support up to 128 users, highlighting that quantum\nprotected GPON networks could be commonplace in the future.\n", "  Recent analyses of cosmic ray arrival directions have resulted in evidence\nfor a positive correlation with active galactic nuclei positions that has weak\nsignificance against an isotropic source distribution. In this paper, we\nexplore the sample size needed to measure a highly statistically significant\ncorrelation to a parent source catalogue. We compare several scenarios for the\ndirectional scattering of ultra-high energy cosmic rays given our current\nknowledge of the galactic and intergalactic magnetic fields. We find\nsignificant correlations are possible for a sample of $>$1000 cosmic ray\nprotons with energies above 60 EeV.\n", "  Motivated by the tension between the Higgs mass and muon g-2 in minimal\nsupersymmetric standard model (MSSM), we analyze the muon g-2 in supersymmertic\nB-L extension of the standard model (BLSSM) with inverse seesaw mechanism. In\nthis model, the Higgs mass receives extra important radiative corrections\nproportional to large neutrino Yukawa coupling. We point out that muon g-2 also\ngets significant contribution, due to the constructive interferences of light\nneutralino effects. The light neutralinos are typically the MSSM Bino like and\nthe supersymmetric partner of U(1)_B-L gauge boson (B'-ino). We show that with\nuniversal soft supersymmetry breaking terms, the muon g-2 resides within 2\nsigma of the measured value, namely ~17 x 10^-10, with Higgs mass equal to 125\nGeV .\n", "  We calculate the unpolarized transverse momentum dependent fragmentation\nfunction (TMDFF) at next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO), evaluating separately\nTMD soft factor and TMD collinear correlator. For the first time the\ncancellation of spurious rapidity divergences in a properly defined individual\nTMD beyond the first non-trivial order is shown. This represents a strong check\nof the given TMD definition. We extract the matching coefficient necessary to\nperform the transverse momentum resummation at\nnext-to-next-to-next-to-leading-logarithmic accuracy. The universal character\nof the soft function, which enters the definition of all (un)polarized TMD\ndistribution/fragmentation functions, facilitates the future calculation of all\nthe other TMDs and their coefficients at NNLO, pushing forward the accuracy of\ntheoretical predictions for the current and next generation of high energy\ncolliders.\n", "  A universal approach to decoherence control combined with quantum estimation\ntheory reveals a critical behavior, akin to a phase transition, of the\ninformation obtainable by a qubit probe concerning the memory time of\nenvironmental fluctuations. This criticality emerges only when the probe is\nsubject to dynamical control. It gives rise to a sharp transition between two\ndynamical phases characterized by either a short or long memory time compared\nto the probing time. This phase-transition of the environmental information is\na fundamental feature that facilitates the attainment of the highest estimation\nprecision of the environment memory-time and the characterization of probe\ndynamics.\n", "  Time reversal symmetric topological superconductors in three spatial\ndimensions carry gapless surface Majorana fermions. They are robust against any\ntime reversal symmetric single-body perturbation weaker than the bulk energy\ngap. We mimic the massless surface Majorana's by coupled wire models in two\nspatial dimensions. We introduce explicit many-body interwire interactions that\npreserve time reversal symmetry and give energy gaps to all low energy degrees\nof freedom. We show the gapped models generically carry non-trivial topological\norder and support anyonic excitations.\n", "  Accurate understanding of the subsurface production rate of the radionuclide\n$^{39}$Ar is necessary for argon dating techniques and noble gas geochemistry\nof the shallow and the deep Earth, and is also of interest to the WIMP dark\nmatter experimental particle physics community. Our new calculations of\nsubsurface production of neutrons, $^{21}$Ne, and $^{39}$Ar take advantage of\nthe state-of-the-art reliable tools of nuclear physics to obtain reaction cross\nsections and spectra (TALYS) and to evaluate neutron propagation in rock\n(MCNP6). We discuss our method and results in relation to previous studies and\nshow the relative importance of various neutron, $^{21}$Ne, and $^{39}$Ar\nnucleogenic production channels. Uncertainty in nuclear reaction cross\nsections, which is the major contributor to overall calculation uncertainty, is\nestimated from variability in existing experimental and library data. Depending\non selected rock composition, on the order of $10^7$-$10^{10}$ {\\alpha}\nparticles are produced in one kilogram of rock per year (order of 1-$10^3$\nkg$^{-1}$ s$^{-1}$); the number of produced neutrons is lower by $\\sim6$ orders\nof magnitude, $^{21}$Ne production rate drops by an additional factor of 15-20,\nand another one order of magnitude or more is dropped in production of\n$^{39}$Ar. Our calculation yields a nucleogenic $^{21}$Ne/$^4$He production\nratio of $(4.6\\pm0.6) \\times 10^{-8}$ in Continental Crust and $(4.2\\pm0.5)\n\\times 10^{-8}$ in Oceanic Crust and Depleted Mantle. Calculated $^{39}$Ar\nproduction rates span a great range from $29\\pm9$ atoms kg-rock$^{-1}$\nyr$^{-1}$ in the K-Th-U-enriched Upper Continental Crust to $(2.6\\pm0.8) \\times\n10^{-4}$ atoms kg-rock$^{-1}$ yr$^{-1}$ in Depleted Upper Mantle. Nucleogenic\n$^{39}$Ar production exceeds the cosmogenic production below $\\sim700$ meters\ndepth and thus, affects radiometric ages of groundwater.\n", "  In the framework of a multisource thermal model, we describe experimental\nresults of the transverse momentum spectra of final-state light flavour\nparticles produced in gold-gold (Au-Au), copper-copper (Cu-Cu), lead-lead\n(Pb-Pb), proton-lead ($p$-Pb), and proton-proton ($p$-$p$) collisions at\nvarious energies, measured by the PHENIX, STAR, ALICE, and CMS Collaborations,\nby using the Tsallis-standard (Tsallis form of Fermi-Dirac or Bose-Einstein),\nTsallis, and two- or three-component standard distributions which can be in\nfact regarded as different types of \"thermometers\" or \"thermometric scales\" and\n\"speedometers\". A central parameter in the three distributions is the effective\ntemperature which contains information on the kinetic freeze-out temperature of\nthe emitting source and reflects the effects of random thermal motion of\nparticles as well as collective expansion of the source. To disentangle both\neffects, we extract the kinetic freeze-out temperature from the intercept of\nthe effective temperature ($T$) curve as a function of particle's rest mass\n($m_0$) when plotting $T$ versus $m_0$, and the mean transverse flow velocity\nfrom the slope of the mean transverse momentum ($\\langle p_T \\rangle$) curve as\na function of mean moving mass ($\\overline{m}$) when plotting $\\langle p_T\n\\rangle$ versus $\\overline{m}$.\n", "  A toy model is developed to understand how the spatial distribution of\nfluorescent emitters in the vicinity of bright quasars could be affected by the\ngeometry of the quasar bi-conical radiation field and by its lifetime. The\nmodel is then applied to the distribution of high equivalent width Lyman\n$\\alpha$ emitters (with rest-frame equivalent widths above 100 A, threshold\nused in e.g. Trainor & Steidel, 2013) identified in a deep narrow-band 36x36\narcmin$^2$ image centered on the luminous quasar Q0420-388. These emitters are\nfound to the edge of the field and show some evidence of an azimuthal asymmetry\non the sky of the type expected if the quasar is radiating in a bipolar cone.\nIf these sources are being fluorescently illuminated by the quasar, the two\nmost distant objects require a lifetime of at least 15 Myr for an opening angle\nof 60 degrees or more, increasing to more than 40 Myr if the opening angle is\nreduced to a minimum 30 degrees. However, few of the other expected signatures\nof boosted fluorescence are seen at the current survey limits, e.g. a fall off\nin Lyman $\\alpha$ brightness, or equivalent width, with distance. Furthermore,\nto have most of the Lyman $\\alpha$ emission of the two distant sources to be\nfluorescently boosted would require the quasar to have been significantly\nbrighter in the past. This suggests that these particular sources may not be\nfluorescent, invalidating the above lifetime constraints. This would cast doubt\non the use of this relatively low equivalent width threshold and thus on the\nlifetime analysis in Trainor & Steidel (2013).\n", "  Terahertz electromagnetic radiation is extremely useful for numerous\napplications such as imaging and spectroscopy. Therefore, it is highly\ndesirable to have an efficient table-top emitter covering the 1-to-30-THz\nwindow whilst being driven by a low-cost, low-power femtosecond laser\noscillator. So far, all solid-state emitters solely exploit physics related to\nthe electron charge and deliver emission spectra with substantial gaps. Here,\nwe take advantage of the electron spin to realize a conceptually new terahertz\nsource which relies on tailored fundamental spintronic and photonic phenomena\nin magnetic metal multilayers: ultrafast photo-induced spin currents, the\ninverse spin-Hall effect and a broadband Fabry-P\\'erot resonance. Guided by an\nanalytical model, such spintronic route offers unique possibilities for\nsystematic optimization. We find that a 5.8-nm-thick W/CoFeB/Pt trilayer\ngenerates ultrashort pulses fully covering the 1-to-30-THz range. Our novel\nsource outperforms laser-oscillator-driven emitters such as ZnTe(110) crystals\nin terms of bandwidth, terahertz-field amplitude, flexibility, scalability and\ncost.\n", "  Achieving error rates that meet or exceed the fault-tolerance threshold is a\ncentral goal for quantum computing experiments, and measuring these error rates\nusing randomized benchmarking is now routine. However, direct comparison\nbetween measured error rates and thresholds is complicated by the fact that\nbenchmarking estimates average error rates while thresholds reflect worst-case\nbehavior when a gate is used as part of a large computation. These two measures\nof error can differ by orders of magnitude in the regime of interest. Here we\nfacilitate comparison between the experimentally accessible average error rates\nand the worst-case quantities that arise in current threshold theorems by\nderiving relations between the two for a variety of physical noise sources. Our\nresults indicate that it is coherent errors that lead to an enormous mismatch\nbetween average and worst case, and we quantify how well these errors must be\ncontrolled to ensure fair comparison between average error probabilities and\nfault-tolerance thresholds.\n", "  We characterize the physical properties of the cool T ~10^4 K circumgalactic\nmedium surrounding z ~2-3 quasar host galaxies, which are predicted to evolve\ninto present day massive ellipticals. Using a statistical sample of 14 quasar\npairs with projected separation < 300 kpc and high dispersion, high S/N\nspectra, we find extreme kinematics with low metal ion lines typically spanning\n~ 500 km/s, exceeding any previously studied galactic population. The CGM is\nsignificantly enriched, even beyond the virial radius, with a median\nmetallicity [M/H] ~ -0.6. The alpha/Fe abundance ratio is enhanced, suggesting\nthat halo gas is primarily enriched by core-collapse supernovae. The projected\ncool gas mass within the virial radius is estimated to be 1.9*10^11 M_sun\n(R_\\perp/160 kpc)^2, accounting for ~ 1/3 of the galaxy halo baryonic budget.\nThe ionization state of CGM gas increases with projected distance from the\nforeground quasars, contrary to expectation if the quasar dominates the\nionizing radiation flux. However, we also found peculiarities not exhibited in\nthe CGM of other galaxy populations. In one absorption system, we may be\ndetecting unresolved fluorescent Ly-alpha emission, and another system shows\nstrong NV lines. Taken together these anomalies suggest that transverse\nsightlines are at least in some cases possibly illuminated. We also discovered\na peculiar case where detection of the CII* fine structure line implies an\nelectron density > 100 cm^-3 and subparsec scale gas clumps.\n", "  Motivated by the realization of hard-wall boundary conditions in experiments\nwith ultracold atoms, we investigate the ground-state properties of spin-1/2\nfermions with attractive interactions in a one-dimensional box. We use lattice\nMonte Carlo methods to determine essential quantities like the energy, which we\ncompute as a function of coupling strength and particle number in the regime\nfrom few to many particles. Many-fermion systems bound by hard walls display\nnon-trivial density profiles characterized by so-called Friedel oscillations\n(which are similar to those observed in harmonic traps). In non-interacting\nsystems, the characteristic length scale of the oscillations is set by (2\nkF)^(-1), where kF is the Fermi momentum, while repulsive interactions tend to\ngenerate Wigner-crystal oscillations of period (4 kF)^(-1). Based on the\nnon-interacting result, we find a remarkably simple parametrization of the\ndensity profiles of the attractively interacting case, which we generalize to\nthe one-body density matrix. While the total momentum is not a conserved\nquantity in the presence of hard walls, the magnitude of the momentum does\nprovide a good quantum number. We are therefore able to provide a detailed\ncharacterization of the (quasi-)momentum distribution, which displays rather\nrobust discontinuity at the Fermi surface. In addition, we determine the\nspatially varying on-site density-density correlation, which in turn yields\nTan's contact density and, upon integration, Tan's contact. As is well known,\nthe latter fully determines the short-range correlations and plays a crucial\nrole in a multitude of equilibrium and non-equilibrium sum rules.\n", "  The progress in high-precision spectroscopy requires one to verify the\naccuracy of theoretical models such as the master equation describing\nspontaneous emission of atoms. For this purpose, we apply the coarse-graining\nmethod to derive a master equation of an atom interacting with the modes of the\nelectromagnetic field. This master equation naturally includes terms due to\nquantum interference in the decay channels and fulfills the requirements of the\nLindblad theorem without the need of phenomenological assumptions. We then\nconsider the spectroscopy of the 2S-4P line of atomic Hydrogen and show that\nthese interference terms, typically neglected, significantly contribute to the\nphoton count signal. These results can be important in understanding\nspectroscopic measurements performed in recent experiments for testing the\nvalidity of quantum electrodynamics.\n", "  Statistical Mechanics deals with ensembles of microstates that are compatible\nwith fixed constraints and that on average define a thermodynamic macrostate.\nThe evolution of a small system is normally subjected to changing constraints\nand involve a stochastic dependence on previous events. Here, we develop a\ntheory for reversible processes with memory that comprises equilibrium\nstatistics and that converges to the same physics in the limit of independent\nevents. This framework is based on the characterization of single phase-space\npathways and is used to derive ensemble-average dynamics in stochastic systems\ndriven by a protocol in the limit of no friction. We show that the state of a\nsystem depends on its history to the extent of attaining a one-to-one\ncorrespondence between states and pathways when memory covers all the previous\nevents. Equilibrium appears as the consequence of exploring all pathways that\nconnect two states by all procedures. This theory is useful to interpret\nsingle-molecule experiments in Biophysics and other fields in Nanoscience and\nan adequate platform for a general theory of irreversible processes.\n", "  Optomechanical systems explore and exploit the coupling between light and the\nmechanical motion of matter. A nonlinear coupling offers access to rich new\nphysics, in both the quantum and classical regimes. We investigate a dynamic,\nas opposed to the usually studied static, nonlinear optomechanical system,\ncomprising of a nanosphere levitated and cooled in a hybrid electro-optical\ntrap. An optical cavity offers readout of both linear-in-position and\nquadratic-in-position (nonlinear) light-matter coupling, whilst simultaneously\ncooling the nanosphere to millikelvin temperatures for indefinite periods of\ntime in high vacuum. We observe cooling of the linear and non-linear motion,\nleading to a $10^5$ fold reduction in phonon number $n_p$, attaining final\noccupancies of $n_p = 100-1000$. This work puts cavity cooling of a levitated\nobject to the quantum ground-state firmly within reach.\n", "  We model the decoherence and dephasing of nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in\ndiamond due to a noisy paramagnetic bath, with and without the presence of a rf\nfield that couples levels of the ground electronic state manifold, using a\nsimple quantum mechanical model that allows for analytical solutions. The model\ntreats the NV three-level ground state system in the presence of fluctuating\nmagnetic fields that arise from the environment, and that result in\ndecoherence, dephasing and dissipation. We show that all 9 eigenmodes of the\nthree-level system are coupled to each other due to interaction with the\nenvironment, and we discuss consequences for fitting experiments in which\ndecoherence plays a role.\n", "  We compute next to eikonal (NE) and next to next to eikonal (NNE) corrections\nto the Lipatov vertex due to a finite target thickness. These arise from\nelectric field insertions into the eikonal Wilson lines. We then derive a\n$k_T$-factorization formula for single inclusive gluon production at NNE\naccuracy and find that nuclear effects are absent. We also analyze NNE\ncorrections to two-gluon production where some of the contributions are found\nto exhibit corrections proportional to $A^{2/3}$.\n", "  The authors report on the design and measurement of a reflective single-pole\nsingle-throw microwave switch with no internal power dissipation, based on a\nsuperconducting circuit containing a single Josephson junction. The data\ndemonstrate the switch operation with 2 GHz instantaneous bandwidth centered at\n10 GHz, low insertion loss, and better than 20 dB on/off ratio. The switch's\nmeasured performance agrees well with simulations for input powers up to -100\ndBm. An extension of the demonstrated circuit to implement a single-pole\ndouble-throw switch is shown in simulation.\n", "  Setting the timeline of the events which shaped the Milky Way disc through\nits 13 billion year old history is one of the major challenges in the theory of\ngalaxy formation. Achieving this goal is possible using late-type stars, which\nin virtue of their long lifetimes can be regarded as fossil remnants from\nvarious epochs of the formation of the Galaxy. There are two main paths to\nreliably age-date late-type stars: astrometric distances for stars in the\nturn-off and subgiant region, or oscillation frequencies along the red giant\nbranch. So far, these methods have been applied to large samples of stars in\nthe solar neighbourhood, and in the Kepler field. I review these studies,\nemphasize how they complement each other, and highlight some of the constraints\nthey provide for Galactic modelling. I conclude with the prospects and\nsynergies that astrometric (Gaia) and asteroseismic space-borne missions\nreserve to the field of Galactic Archaeology, and advocate that survey\nselection functions should be kept as simple as possible, relying on basic\nobservables such as colours and magnitudes only.\n", "  We calculate a set of one-loop corrections to $h\\to b\\bar b$ and $h\\to\n\\tau\\bar \\tau$ decays in the dimension-6 Standard Model effective field theory\n(SMEFT). In particular, working in the limit of vanishing gauge couplings, we\ncalculate directly in the broken phase of the theory all large logarithmic\ncorrections and in addition the finite corrections in the large-$m_t$ limit.\nMoreover, we give exact results for one-loop contributions from four-fermion\noperators. We obtain these corrections within an extension of the widely used\non-shell renormalisation scheme appropriate for SMEFT calculations, and show\nexplicitly how UV divergent bare amplitudes from a total of 21 different SMEFT\noperators are rendered finite within this scheme. As a by-product of the\ncalculation, we also compute to one-loop order the logarithmically enhanced and\nfinite large-$m_t$ corrections to muon decay in the limit of vanishing gauge\ncouplings, which is necessary to implement the $G_F$ input parameter scheme\nwithin the SMEFT.\n", "  A review of the Gaia mission and its science performance after one year of\noperations will be presented, and the contribution to reconstructing the\nhistory of the Milky Way will be outlined.\n", "  Motivated by experimental observation of the Kondo-enhanced Andreev transport\n[R. S. Deacon \\textit{et al.}, PRB \\textbf{81}, 121308(R) (2010)] in a hybrid\nnormal metal-quantum dot-superconductor (N-QD-S) device, we theoretically study\nthe Kondo effect in such a device and clarify the different roles played by the\nnormal and superconducting leads. Due to the Andreev reflection in a QD-S\nsystem, a pair of Andreev energy levels form in the superconducting gap, which\nis able to carry the magnetic moment if the ground state of the QD is a\nmagnetic doublet. In this sense, the Andreev energy levels play a role of\neffective impurity levels. When the normal lead is coupled to the QD-S system,\non the one hand, the Andreev energy levels broaden to form the so-called\nAndreev bound states (ABSs), on the other hand, it can screen the magnetic\nmoment of the ABSs. By tuning the couplings between the QD and the normal\n(superconducting) leads, the ABSs can simulate the Kondo, mixed-valence, and\neven empty orbit regimes of the usual single-impurity Anderson model. The above\npicture is confirmed by the Green's function calculation of the hybrid N-QD-S\nAnderson model and is also able to explain qualitatively experimental phenomena\nobserved by Deacon \\textit{et al.}. These results can further stimulate related\nexperimental study in the N-QD-S systems.\n", "  The physical properties of epitaxial films can fundamentally differ from\nthose of bulk single crystals even above the critical thickness. By a\ncombination of non-resonant x-ray magnetic scattering, neutron diffraction and\nvector-mapped x-ray magnetic linear dichroism photoemission electron\nmicroscopy, we show that epitaxial (111)-BiFeO3 films support sub-micron\nantiferromagnetic domains, which are magneto-elastically coupled to a coherent\ncrystallographic monoclinic twin structure. This unique texture, which is\nabsent in bulk single crystals, should enable control of magnetism in BiFeO3\nfilm devices via epitaxial strain.\n", "  A newly developed hypergeometric resummation technique [H. Mera et al., Phys.\nRev. Lett. 115, 143001 (2015)] provides an easy-to-use recipe to obtain\nconserving approximations within the self-consistent nonequilibrium many-body\nperturbation theory. We demonstrate the usefulness of this technique by\ncalculating the phonon-limited electronic current in a model of a\nsingle-molecule junction within the self-consistent Born approximation for the\nelectron-phonon interacting system, where the perturbation expansion for the\nnonequilibrium Green function in powers of the free bosonic propagator\ntypically consists of a series of non-crossing \\sunset\" diagrams.\nHypergeometric resummation preserves conservation laws and it is shown to\nprovide substantial convergence acceleration relative to more standard\napproaches to self-consistency. This result strongly suggests that the\nconvergence of the self-consistent \\sunset\" series is limited by a branch-cut\nsingularity, which is accurately described by Gauss hypergeometric functions.\nOur results showcase an alternative approach to conservation laws and\nself-consistency where expectation values obtained from conserving perturbation\nexpansions are \\summed\" to their self-consistent value by analytic continuation\nfunctions able to mimic the convergence-limiting singularity structure.\n", "  We obtain bounds for the minimum and maximum mass/radius ratio of a stable,\ncharged, spherically symmetric compact object in a $D$-dimensional space-time\nin the framework of general relativity, and in the presence of dark energy. The\ntotal energy, including the gravitational component, and the stability of\nobjects with minimum mass/radius ratio is also investigated. The minimum energy\ncondition leads to a representation of the mass and radius of the charged\nobjects with minimum mass/radius ratio in terms of the charge and vacuum energy\nonly. As applied to the electron in the four-dimensional case, this procedure\nallows one to re-obtain the classical electron radius from purely general\nrelativistic considerations. By combining the lower mass bound, in four\nspace-time dimensions, with minimum length uncertainty relations (MLUR)\nmotivated by quantum gravity, we obtain an alternative bound for the maximum\ncharge/mass ratio of a stable, gravitating, charged quantum mechanical object,\nexpressed in terms of fundamental constants. Evaluating this limit numerically,\nwe obtain again the correct order of magnitude value for the charge/mass ratio\nof the electron, as required by the stability conditions. This suggests that,\nif the electron were either less massive (with the same charge) or if its\ncharge were any higher (for fixed mass), a combination of electrostatic and\ndark energy repulsion would destabilize the Compton radius. In other words, the\nelectron would blow itself apart. Our results suggest the existence of a deep\nconnection between gravity, the presence of the cosmological constant, and the\nstability of fundamental particles.\n", "  A linear analysis of the zombie vortex instability is performed in a\nstratified shearing sheet setting for three model barotropic shear flows. The\nlinear analysis is done by utilizing a Green's function formulation to resolve\nthe critical layers of the associated normal-mode problem. The instability is\nthe result of a resonant interaction between a Rossby wave and a gravity wave\nwhich we refer to as Z-modes. The associated critical layer is the location\nwhere the Doppler shifted frequency of a distant Rossby wave equals the local\nBrunt-Vaisala frequency. The minimum required Rossby number for instability,\nRo= 0.2, is confirmed for parameter values reported in the literature. It is\nalso found that the shear layer supports the instability in the limit where\nstratification vanishes. The zombie vortex instability is examined in a jet\nmodel, finding that the instability can occur for Ro= 0.05. Nonlinear vorticity\nforcing due to unstable Z-modes is shown to result in the creation of a jet\nflow at the critical layer emerging as the result of the competition between\nthe vertical lifting of perturbation radial vorticity and the radial transport\nof perturbation vertical vorticity. We find that the picture of this\ninstability leading to a form of nonlinearly driven self-replicating pattern of\ncreation and destruction is warranted: a parent jet spawns a growing child jet\nat associated critical layers. A mature child jet creates a next generation of\nchild jets at associated critical layers while simultaneously destroying its\nparent jet via the Rossby wave instability.\n", "  The main objective of this work is to perform a detailed comparison of the\nlattice Boltzmann equation (LBE) and the recently developed discrete unified\ngas-kinetic scheme (DUGKS) methods for direct numerical simulation (DNS) of the\ndecaying homogeneous isotropic turbulence (DHIT) in a periodic box. The flow\nfields and key statistical quantities computed by both methods are compared\nwith those from pseudo-spectral (PS) method. The results show that the LBE and\nDUGKS have almost the same accuracy when the flow field is well-resolved, and\nthat the LBE is less dissipative and is slightly more efficient than the DUGKS,\nbut the latter has a superior numerical stability, particularly for high\nReynolds number flows. Therefore, the DUGKS method can be viewed as a viable\ntool for DNS of turbulent flows. It should be emphasized that the main\nadvantage of the DUGKS when compared with the LBE method is its feasibility in\nadopting nonuniform meshes, which is critical for wall-bounded turbulent flows.\nThe present work provides a basis for further applications of DUGKS in studying\nthe physics of the turbulent flows.\n", "  We construct forecasts for cosmological parameter constraints from weak\ngravitational lensing surveys involving the Square Kilometre Array (SKA).\nConsidering matter content, dark energy and modified gravity parameters, we\nshow that the first phase of the SKA (SKA1) can be competitive with other Stage\nIII experiments such as the Dark Energy Survey (DES) and that the full SKA\n(SKA2) can potentially form tighter constraints than Stage IV optical weak\nlensing experiments, such as those that will be conducted with LSST,\nWFIRST-AFTA or Euclid-like facilities. Using weak lensing alone, going from\nSKA1 to SKA2 represents improvements by factors of $\\sim10$ in matter, $\\sim10$\nin dark energy and $\\sim5$ in modified gravity parameters. We also show, for\nthe first time, the powerful result that comparably tight constraints (within\n$\\sim5\\%$) for both Stage III and Stage IV experiments, can be gained from\ncross-correlating shear maps between the optical and radio wavebands, a process\nwhich can also eliminate a number of potential sources of systematic errors\nwhich can otherwise limit the utility of weak lensing cosmology.\n", "  We construct a pipeline for simulating weak lensing cosmology surveys with\nthe Square Kilometre Array (SKA), taking as inputs telescope sensitivity\ncurves; correlated source flux, size and redshift distributions; a simple\nionospheric model; source redshift and ellipticity measurement errors. We then\nuse this simulation pipeline to optimise a 2-year weak lensing survey performed\nwith the first deployment of the SKA (SKA1). Our assessments are based on the\ntotal signal-to-noise of the recovered shear power spectra, a metric that we\nfind to correlate very well with a standard dark energy figure of merit. We\nfirst consider the choice of frequency band, trading off increases in number\ncounts at lower frequencies against poorer resolution; our analysis strongly\nprefers the higher frequency Band 2 (950-1760 MHz) channel of the SKA-MID\ntelescope to the lower frequency Band 1 (350-1050 MHz). Best results would be\nobtained by allowing the centre of Band 2 to shift towards lower frequency,\naround 1.1 GHz. We then move on to consider survey size, finding that an area\nof 5,000 square degrees is optimal for most SKA1 instrumental configurations.\nFinally, we forecast the performance of a weak lensing survey with the second\ndeployment of the SKA. The increased survey size (3$\\pi$\\,steradian) and\nsensitivity improves both the signal-to-noise and the dark energy metrics by\ntwo orders of magnitude.\n", "  In recent years, several measures have been proposed for characterizing the\ncoherence of a given quantum state. We derive several results that illuminate\nhow these measures behave when restricted to pure states. Notably, we present\nan explicit characterization of the closest incoherent state to a given pure\nstate under the trace distance measure of coherence. We then use this result to\nshow that the states maximizing the trace distance of coherence are exactly the\nmaximally coherent states. We define the trace distance of entanglement and\nshow that it coincides with the trace distance of coherence for pure states.\nFinally, we give an alternate proof to a recent result that the $\\ell_1$\nmeasure of coherence of a pure state is never smaller than its relative entropy\nof coherence.\n", "  To explore capabilities of moderate-size optical telescopes in surveys, the\nset of 9 new wide-field designs having apertures up to 1 m is considered. All\nbut one systems have angular field of view in a range 3.5-10 degrees and flat\nfocal surface; the field of the last system is 45 degrees in diameter at the\n0.5 m aperture and spherical focal surface. The complete description of the\noptical layouts is given in the Appendix. Relations between the expected\nlimiting magnitude, survey speed and exposure time allow to choose the system\nthat is most suitable for a particular task of observations. In principle, a\nsingle wide-field telescope with the aperture of approximately 1 m can detect\nobjects brighter than 22.5 magnitude over the entire hemisphere within one\nnight, however, the reliability of acquired data can be significantly increased\nby using a hierarchic observational network comprised of telescopes with\noptimized parameters.\n", "  The auxiliary function of a classical channel appears in two fundamental\nquantities that upper and lower bound the error probability, respectively. A\ncrucial property of the auxiliary function is its concavity, which leads to\nseveral important results in finite block length analysis. In this paper, we\nprove that the auxiliary function of a classical-quantum channel also enjoys\nthe same concave property, extending an earlier partial result to its full\ngenerality. The key component in our proof is a beautiful result of geometric\nmeans of operators.\n", "  The present note is mostly a survey on the generalised Hitchin integrable\nsystem and moduli spaces of meromorphic Higgs bundles. We also fill minor gaps\nin the existing literature, outline a calculation of the infinitesimal period\nmap and review briefly some related geometries.\n", "  We use the observed unresolved cosmic X-ray background (CXRB) in the 0.5-2\nkeV band and existing upper limits on the 21-cm power spectrum to constrain the\nhigh-redshift population of X-ray sources, focusing on their effect on the\nthermal history of the Universe and the cosmic 21-cm signal. Because the\nproperties of these sources are poorly constrained, we consider hot gas, X-ray\nbinaries and mini-quasars (i.e., sources with soft or hard X-ray spectra) as\npossible candidates. We find that (1) the soft-band CXRB sets an upper limit on\nthe X-ray efficiency of sources that existed before the end of reionization,\nwhich is one-to-two orders of magnitude higher than typically assumed\nefficiencies, (2) hard sources are more effective in generating the CXRB than\nthe soft ones, (3) the commonly-assumed limit of saturated heating is not valid\nduring the first half of reionization in the case of hard sources, with any\nallowed value of X-ray efficiency, (4) the maximal allowed X-ray efficiency\nsets a lower limit on the depth of the absorption trough in the global 21-cm\nsignal and an upper limit on the height of the emission peak, while in the\n21-cm power spectrum it sets a minimum amplitude and frequency for the\nhigh-redshift peaks, and (5) the existing upper limit on the 21-cm power\nspectrum sets a lower limit on the X-ray efficiency for each model. When\ncombined with the 21-cm global signal, the CXRB will be useful for breaking\ndegeneracies and helping constrain the nature of high-redshift heating sources.\n", "  A Materials Project based open-source Python tool, MPInterfaces, has been\ndeveloped to automate the high-throughput computational screening and study of\ninterfacial systems. The framework encompasses creation and manipulation of\ninterface structures for solid/solid hetero-structures, solid/implicit solvents\nsystems, nanoparticle/ligands systems; and the creation of simple\nsystem-agnostic workflows for in depth computational analysis using\ndensity-functional theory or empirical energy models. The package leverages\nexisting open-source high-throughput tools and extends their capabilities\ntowards the understanding of interfacial systems. We describe the various\nalgorithms and methods implemented in the package. Using several test cases, we\ndemonstrate how the package enables high-throughput computational screening of\nadvanced materials, directly contributing to the Materials Genome Initiative\n(MGI), which aims to accelerate the discovery, development, and deployment of\nnew materials.\n", "  We treat quantum creation of gravitons by small scale factor oscillations\naround the average of an expanding universe. Such oscillations can arise in\nstandard general relativity due to oscillations of a homogeneous, minimally\ncoupled scalar field. They can also arise in modified gravity theories with a\nterm proportional to the square of the Ricci scalar in the gravitational\naction. The graviton wave equation is different in the two cases, leading to\nsomewhat different creation rates. Both cases are treated using a perturbative\nmethod due to Birrell and Davies, involving an expansion in a conformal\ncoupling parameter to calculate the number density and energy density of the\ncreated gravitons. Cosmological constraints on the present graviton energy\ndensity and the dimensionless amplitude of the oscillations are discussed. We\nalso discuss decoherence of quantum systems produced by the spacetime geometry\nfluctuations due to such a graviton bath.\n", "  The LHC has recently reported a slight excess in the $h\\rightarrow \\tau \\mu$\nchannel. If this lepton flavor violating (LFV) decay is confirmed, an extension\nof the Standard Model (SM) will be required to explain it. In this paper we\ninvestigate two different possibilities to accommodate such a LFV process: the\nfirst scenario is based on flavor off-diagonal $A$-terms in the Minimal\nSupersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM), and the second is a model where the Higgs\ncouples to new vectorlike fermions that couple to the SM leptons through a LFV\nfour fermion interaction. In the supersymmetric model, we find that the sizes\nof the $A$-terms needed to accommodate the $h\\rightarrow \\tau\\mu$ excess are in\nconflict with charge- and color-breaking vacuum constraints. In the second\nmodel, the excess can be successfully explained while satisfying all other\nflavor constrains, with order one couplings, vectorlike fermion masses as low\nas 15 TeV, and a UV scale higher than 35 TeV.\n", "  Formulating consistent theories describing strongly correlated metallic\ntopological phases is an outstanding problem in condensed matter physics. In\nthis work we derive a theory defining a fractionalized analogue of the Weyl\nsemimetal state: the fractional chiral metal. Our approach is to construct a\n4+1D quantum Hall insulator by stacking 3+1D Weyl semimetals in a magnetic\nfield. In a strong enough field the low-energy physics is determined by the\nlowest Landau level of each Weyl semimetal, which is highly degenerate and\nchiral, motivating us to use a coupled-wire approach. The one-dimensional\ndispersion of the lowest Landau level allows us to model the system as a set of\ndegenerate 1+1D quantum wires that can be bosonized in the presence of\nelectron-electron interactions and coupled such that a gapped phase is\nobtained, whose response to an electromagnetic field is given in terms of a\nChern-Simons field theory. At the boundary of this phase we obtain the field\ntheory of a 3+1D gapless fractional chiral state, which we show is consistent\nwith a previous theory for the surface of a 4+1D Chern-Simons theory. The\nboundary's response to an external electromagnetic field is determined by a\nchiral anomaly with a fractionalized coefficient. We suggest that such\nanomalous response can be taken as a working definition of a fractionalized\nstrongly correlated analogue of the Weyl semimetal state.\n", "  We show that a local measurement of temperature and voltage for a quantum\nsystem in steady state, arbitrarily far from equilibrium, with arbitrary\ninteractions within the system, is unique when it exists. This is interpreted\nas a consequence of the second law of thermodynamics. We further derive a\nnecessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a solution. In this\nregard, we find that a positive temperature solution exists whenever there is\nno net population inversion. However, when there is a net population inversion,\nwe may characterize the system with a unique negative temperature. Voltage and\ntemperature measurements are treated on an equal footing: They are\nsimultaneously measured in a noninvasive manner, via a weakly-coupled\nthermoelectric probe, defined by requiring vanishing charge and heat\ndissipation into the probe. Our results strongly suggest that a local\ntemperature measurement without a simultaneous local voltage measurement, or\nvice-versa, is a misleading characterization of the state of a nonequilibrium\nquantum electron system. These results provide a firm mathematical foundation\nfor voltage and temperature measurements far from equilibrium.\n", "  Thermal conductivity in dielectric crystals is the result of the relaxation\nof lattice vibrations described by the phonon Boltzmann transport equation.\nRemarkably, an exact microscopic definition of the heat carriers and their\nrelaxation times is still missing: phonons, typically regarded as the relevant\nexcitations for thermal transport, cannot be identified as the heat carriers\nwhen most scattering events conserve momentum and do not dissipate heat flux.\nThis is the case for two-dimensional or layered materials at room temperature,\nor three-dimensional crystals at cryogenic temperatures. In this work we show\nthat the eigenvectors of the scattering matrix in the Boltzmann equation define\ncollective phonon excitations, termed here relaxons. These excitations have\nwell defined relaxation times, directly related to heat flux dissipation, and\nprovide an exact description of thermal transport as a kinetic theory of the\nrelaxon gas. We show why Matthiessen's rule is violated, and construct a\nprocedure for obtaining the mean free paths and relaxation times of the\nrelaxons. These considerations are general, and would apply also to other\nsemiclassical transport models, such as the electronic Boltzmann equation. For\nheat transport, they remain relevant even in conventional crystals like\nsilicon, but are of the utmost importance in the case of two-dimensional\nmaterials, where they can revise by several orders of magnitude the relevant\ntime- and length-scales for thermal transport in the hydrodynamic regime.\n", "  The ground-state magnetic phase diagram (including collinear and spiral\nstates) of the single-band Hubbard model for the face-centered cubic lattice\nand related metal-insulator transition (MIT) are investigated within the\nslave-boson approach by Kotliar and Ruckenstein. The correlation induced\nelectronic spectrum narrowing and a comparison with a generalized Hartree-Fock\napproximation allow one to estimate the strength of correlation effects. This,\nas well as the MIT scenario, depends dramatically on the ratio of the\nnext-nearest and nearest electron hopping integrals $t'/t$. In contrast with\nmetallic state, possessing strong band narrowing, insulator one is only weakly\ncorrelated. The magnetic (Slater) scenario of MIT is found to be superior over\nthe Mott one. Unlike simple and body-centered cubic lattices, MIT is the first\norder transition for most $t'/t$. The insulator state is type-II or type-III\nantiferromagnet, and the metallic state is spin-spiral, collinear\nantiferromagnet or paramagnet depending on $t'/t$. The picture of magnetic\nordering is compared with that in the standard localized-electron (Heisenberg)\nmodel.\n", "  Element abundances in high-redshift quasar absorbers offer excellent probes\nof the chemical enrichment of distant galaxies, and can constrain models for\npopulation III and early population II stars. Recent observations indicate that\nthe sub-damped Lyman-alpha (sub-DLA) absorbers are more metal-rich than DLA\nabsorbers at redshifts 0$<$$z$$<$3. It has also been suggested that the DLA\nmetallicity drops suddenly at $z$$>$4.7. However, only 3 DLAs at $z$$>$4.5 and\nnone at $z$$>$3.5 have \"dust-free\" metallicity measurements of undepleted\nelements. We report the first quasar sub-DLA metallicity measurement at\n$z$$>$3.5, from detections of undepleted elements in high-resolution data for a\nsub-DLA at $z$=5.0. We obtain fairly robust abundances of C, O, Si, and Fe,\nusing lines outside the Lyman-alpha forest. This absorber is metal-poor, with\nO/H]=-2.00$\\pm$0.12, which is $\\gtrsim$4$\\sigma$ below the level expected from\nextrapolation of the trend for $z$$<$3.5 sub-DLAs. The C/O ratio is\n1.8$^{+0.4}_{-0.3}$ times lower than in the Sun. More strikingly, Si/O is\n3.2$^{+0.6}_{-0.5}$ times lower than in the Sun, while Si/Fe is nearly\n(1.2$^{+0.4}_{-0.3}$ times) solar. This absorber does not display a clear\nalpha/Fe enhancement. Dust depletion may have removed more Si from the gas\nphase than is common in the Milky Way interstellar medium, which may be\nexpected if high-redshift supernovae form more silicate-rich dust. C/O and Si/O\nvary substantially between different velocity components, indicating spatial\nvariations in dust depletion and/or early stellar nucleosynethesis (e.g.,\npopulation III star initial mass function). The higher velocity gas may trace\nan outflow enriched by early stars.\n", "  We discuss the failure of the Markov approximation in the description of\natom-surface fluctuation-induced interactions, both at equilibrium\n(Casimir-Polder forces) and out-of-equilibrium (quantum friction). Using\ngeneral theoretical arguments, we show that the Markov approximation can lead\nto erroneous predictions of such phenomena with regard to both strength and\nfunctional dependencies on system parameters. Our findings highlight the\nimportance of non-Markovian effects in dispersion interactions. In particular,\nwe show that the long-time power-law tails of temporal correlations, and the\ncorresponding low-frequency behavior, of two-time dipole correlations,\nneglected in the Markovian limit, dramatically affect the prediction of the\nforce.\n", "  We report on the first observation of stationary light pulses and narrowband\nlight storage inside a hollow-core photonic crystal fiber. Laser-cooled atoms\nwere first loaded into the fiber core providing strong light-matter coupling.\nLight pulses were then stored in a collective atomic excitation using a single\ncontrol laser beam. By applying a second counterpropagating control beam, a\nlight pulse could be brought to a standstill. Our work paves the way towards\nthe creation of strongly-correlated many-body systems with photons and\napplications in the field of quantum information processing.\n", "  Particles of low velocity, travelling without dissipation in a superfluid,\ncan interact and emit sound when they collide. We propose a minimal model in\nwhich the equations of motion of the particles, including a short-range\nrepulsive force, are self-consistently coupled with the Gross-Pitaevskii\nequation. We use this model to demonstrate the existence of an effective\nsuperfluid-mediated attractive interaction between the particles; and we study\nnumerically the collisional dynamics of particles as a function of their\nincident kinetic energy and the length-scale of the repulsive force. We find a\ntransition from almost elastic to completely inelastic (sticking) collisions as\nthe parameters are tuned. We find that aggregation and clustering result from\nthis sticking transition in multi-particle systems.\n", "  We study a range of radio-frequency ion trap geometries and investigate the\neffect of integrating dielectric cavity mirrors on their trapping potential. We\naim to identify ion trap and cavity configurations that are best suited for\nachieving small cavity volumes and thus large ion-photon coupling as required\nfor scalable quantum information networks. In particular, we investigate the\ntrapping potential distortions caused by the dielectric material of the cavity\nmirrors for different mirror orientations with respect to the trapping\nelectrodes, as well as for mirror misalignment. We also analyze the effect of\nthe mirror material properties such as dielectric constants and surface\nconductivity, and study the effect of surface charges on the mirrors. The\nsmallest trapping potential distortions are found if the cavities are aligned\nalong the major symmetry axis of the electrode geometries. These cavity\nconfigurations also appear to be the most stable with respect to any mirror\nmisalignment.\n", "  Stream-stream collisions play an important role for the circularization of\nhighly eccentric streams resulting from tidal disruption events (TDEs). We\nperform three dimensional radiation hydrodynamic simulations to show that\nstream collisions can contribute significant optical and ultraviolet light to\nthe flares produced by TDEs, and can sometimes explain the majority of the\nobserved emission. Our simulations focus on the region near the radiation\npressure dominated shock produced by a collision and track how the kinetic\nenergy of the stream is dissipated by the associated shock. When the mass flow\nrate of the stream $\\dot{M}$ is a significant fraction of the Eddington\naccretion rate, $\\gtrsim2\\%$ of the initial kinetic energy is converted to\nradiation directly as a result of the collision. In this regime, the collision\nredistributes the specific kinetic energy into the downstream gas and more than\n$16\\%$ of the mass can become unbound. The fraction of unbound gas decreases\nrapidly as $\\dot{M}$ drops significantly below the Eddington limit, with no\nunbound gas being produced when $\\dot{M}$ drops to $1\\%$ of Eddington; we find\nhowever that the radiative efficiency increases slightly to $\\lesssim 8\\%$ in\nthese low $\\dot{M}$ cases. The effective radiation temperature and size of the\nphotosphere is determined by the stream velocity and $\\dot{M}$, which we find\nto be a few times $10^4$~K and $10^{14}$~cm in our calculations, comparable to\nthe inferred values of some TDE candidates. The photosphere size is directly\nproportional to $\\dot{M}$, which can explain the rapidly changing photosphere\nsizes seen in TDE candidates such as PS1-10jh.\n", "  We present a general input-output formalism for the few-photon transport in\nmultiple waveguide channels coupled to a local cavity. Using this formalism, we\nstudy the effect of Fano interference in two-photon quantum transport. We show\nthat the physics of Fano interference can manifest as an asymmetric spectral\nline shape in the frequency dependence of the two-photon correlation function.\nThe two-photon fluorescence spectrum, on the other hand, does not exhibit the\nphysics of Fano interference.\n", "  Remote state preparation (RSP) provides an indirect way of manipulating\nquantum information based on the nonlocal effect of quantum measurement.\nAlthough RSP has been demonstrated in recent years to remotely prepare\nmulti-photon states, quantum measurement on the same number of photons was\nrequired, i.e., to prepare N-photon states via RSP, quantum measurement on the\nother N-photons was required, hence significantly limiting practicality and\napplicability of RSP. Here we report the first experimental demonstration of\nremote preparation of three-photon entangled states by measuring only a\nsingle-photon entangled with the three photons. We further generalize our\nprotocol to prepare multi-photon entangled states with arbitrary photon number\nand purity via single-photon measurement. As our RSP scheme relies on the\nnonlinearity induced by single-photon measurement, it enables quantum state\nengineering of multi-photon entangled states beyond the linear optical limit.\nOur results are expected to have significant impacts on quantum metrology and\nquantum information processing.\n", "  We study the dynamical effect of relative velocities between dark matter and\nbaryonic fluids, which remained supersonic after the epoch of recombination.\nThe impact of this supersonic motion on the formation of cosmological\nstructures was first formulated by Tseliakhovich & Hirata (2010), in terms of\nthe linear theory of small-scale fluctuations coupled to large-scale, relative\nvelocities in mean-density regions. In their formalism, they limited the\nlarge-scale density environment to be those of the global mean density. We\nimprove on their formulation by allowing variation in the density environment\nas well as the relative velocities. This leads to a new type of coupling\nbetween large-scale and small-scale modes. We find that the small-scale\nfluctuation grows in a biased way: faster in the overdense environment and\nslower in the underdense environment. We also find that the net effect on the\nglobal power spectrum of the density fluctuation is to boost its overall\namplitude from the prediction by Tseliakhovich & Hirata (2010).\nCorrespondingly, the conditional mass function of cosmological halos and the\nhalo bias parameter are both affected in a similar way. The discrepancy between\nour prediction and that by Tseliakhovich & Hirata (2010) is significant, and\ntherefore the related cosmology and high-redshift astrophysics should be\nrevisited. The mathematical formalism of this study can be used for generating\ncosmological initial conditions of small-scale perturbations in generic,\noverdense (underdense) background patches.\n", "  Magnetic flux noise is a dominant source of dephasing and energy relaxation\nin superconducting qubits. The noise power spectral density varies with\nfrequency as $1/f^\\alpha$ with $\\alpha \\sim 1$ and spans 13 orders of\nmagnitude. Recent work indicates that the noise is from unpaired magnetic\ndefects on the surfaces of the superconducting devices. Here, we demonstrate\nthat adsorbed molecular O$_2$ is the dominant contributor to magnetism in\nsuperconducting thin films. We show that this magnetism can be suppressed by\nappropriate surface treatment or improvement in the sample vacuum environment.\nWe observe a suppression of static spin susceptibility by more than an order of\nmagnitude and a suppression of $1/f$ magnetic flux noise power spectral density\nby more than a factor of 5. These advances open the door to realization of\nsuperconducting qubits with improved quantum coherence.\n", "  We investigate the behavior of two quantum emitters (two-level atoms)\nembedded in a linear waveguide, in a quasi-one-dimensional configuration. Since\nthe atoms can emit, absorb and reflect radiation, the pair can spontaneously\nrelax towards an entangled bound state, under conditions in which a single atom\nwould instead decay. We analyze the properties of these bound states, which\noccur for resonant values of the interatomic distance, and discuss their\nrelevance with respect to entanglement generation. The stability of such states\nclose to the resonance is studied, as well as the properties of non resonant\nbound states, whose energy is below the threshold for photon propagation.\n", "  We report an experimental study of the phase diagrams of periclase (MgO),\nenstatite (MgSiO3) and forsterite (Mg2SiO4) at high pressures. We investigated\nwith laser driven decaying shocks the pressure/temperature curves of MgO,\nMgSiO3 and Mg2SiO4 between 0.2-1.2 TPa, 0.12-0.5 TPa and 0.2-0.85 TPa\nrespectively. A melting signature has been observed in MgO at 0.47 TPa and 9860\nK, while no phase changes were observed neither in MgSiO3 nor in Mg2SiO4. An\nincreasing of reflectivity of MgO, MgSiO3 and Mg2SiO4 liquids have been\ndetected at 0.55 TPa -12 760 K, 0.15 TPa - 7540 K, 0.2 TPa - 5800 K,\nrespectively. In contrast to SiO2, melting and metallization of these compounds\ndo not coincide implying the presence of poor electrically conducting liquids\nclose to the melting lines. This has important implications for the generation\nof dynamos in Super-earths mantles.\n", "  We develop a new method to constrain the physical conditions in the cool\n(~10^4 K) circumgalactic medium (CGM) from measurements of ionic column\ndensities, by assuming that the cool CGM spans a large range of gas densities\nand that small high-density clouds are hierarchically embedded in large\nlow-density clouds. The new method combines the information available from\ndifferent sightlines during the photoionization modeling, thus yielding tighter\nconstraints on CGM properties compared to traditional methods which model each\nsightline individually. Applying this new technique to the COS-Halos survey of\nlow-redshift ~L* galaxies, we find that we can reproduce all observed ion\ncolumns in all 44 galaxies in the sample, from the low-ions to OVI, with a\nsingle universal density structure for the cool CGM. The gas densities span the\nrange 50 < \\rho/\\rho_mean < 5x10^5 (\\rho_mean is the cosmic mean), while the\nphysical size of individual clouds scales as ~\\rho^-1, from ~35 kpc of the low\ndensity OVI clouds to ~6 pc of the highest density low-ion clouds. The deduced\ncloud sizes are too small for this density structure to be driven by\nself-gravity, thus its physical origin is unclear. The implied cool CGM mass\nwithin the virial radius is 1.3x10^10 M_sun (~1% of the halo mass), distributed\nrather uniformly over the four decades in density. The mean cool gas density\nprofile scales as R^-1.0, where R is the distance from the galaxy center. We\nconstruct a 3D model of the cool CGM based on our results, which we argue\nprovides a benchmark for the CGM structure in hydrodynamic simulations. Our\nresults can be tested by measuring the coherence scales of different ions.\n", "  We propose a simple renormalizable grand unified theory based on the $SU(5)$\ngauge symmetry where the neutrino masses are generated at the quantum level\nthrough the Zee mechanism. In this model the same Higgs needed to correct the\nmass relation between charged leptons and down-type quarks plays a crucial role\nto generate neutrino masses. We show that in this model one can satisfy the\nconstrains coming from the unification of gauge couplings and the mechanism for\nneutrino masses is discussed in detail. The predictions for proton decay are\ndiscussed in order to understand the testability at current and future\nexperiments such as Hyper-Kamiokande. This simple theory predicts a light\ncolored octet which could give rise to exotic signatures at the LHC.\n", "  Indirect excitons in coupled quantum wells have long radiative lifetimes and\nform a cold quasi-two-dimensional population suitable for studying collective\nquantum effects. Here we report the observation of the exciton Mott transition\nfrom an insulating (excitons) to a conducting (ionized electron-hole pairs)\nphase, which occurs gradually as a function of carrier density and temperature.\nThe transition is inferred from spectral and time-resolved photoluminescence\nmeasurements around a carrier density of $2\\times10^{10} \\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$ and\ntemperatures of $12-16 \\mathrm{K}$. An externally applied electric field is\nemployed to tune the dynamics of the transition via the quantum-confined Stark\neffect. Our results provide evidence of a gradual nature of the exciton Mott\ntransition.\n", "  We point out that a distinctive mono-top signature is present in Natural SUSY\nscenarios when a scalar top-quark and higgsinos are almost mass degenerate.\nThis signature originates from a supersymmetric counter part of the $t \\bar t\nH$ process, i.e. $pp \\to \\tilde t t \\tilde h$. Unlike mono-jet signatures\nexploiting initial state radiation, this channel can be regarded as a smoking\ngun signature of a light stop and higgsinos, allowing a direct probe of the\nstop and neutralino sectors. The production rate of this channel largely\ndepends on the up-type higgsino components in the neutralinos while the stop\nsector is sensitive to angular distributions of top-quark's decay products. We\ndevelop an optimal search strategy to capture the supersymmetric $t \\bar t H$\nprocess and find that a high luminosity LHC can probe the stop and higgsino\nsectors with $m_{\\tilde t_1} \\lesssim 380$ GeV and $m_{\\tilde t_1} - m_{\\tilde\n\\chi_1^0} \\lesssim m_W$. Additionally, we propose a kinematic variable with\nwhich one can measure the stop mixing in this channel.\n", "  We study the dijet azimuthal de-correlation in relativistic heavy ion\ncollisions as an important probe of the transverse momentum broadening effects\nof a high energy jet traversing the quark-gluon plasma. We take into account\nboth the soft gluon radiation in vacuum associated with the Sudakov logarithms\nand the jet P_T-broadening effects in the QCD medium. We find that the Sudakov\neffects are dominant at the LHC, while the medium effects can play an important\nrole at RHIC energies. This explains why the LHC experiments have not yet\nobserved sizable P_T-broadening effects in the measurement of dijet azimuthal\ncorrelations in heavy ion collisions. Future investigations at RHIC will\nprovide a unique opportunity to study the P_T-broadening effects and help to\npin down the underlying mechanism for jet energy loss in a hot and dense\nmedium.\n", "  A system driven in the vicinity of its critical point by varying a relevant\nfield in an arbitrary function of time is a generic system that possesses a\nlong relaxation time compared with the driving time scale and thus represents a\nlarge class of nonequilibrium systems. For such a manifestly nonlinear\nnonequilibrium strongly fluctuating system, we show that there exists universal\nnonequilibrium critical behavior that is well described incredibly by its\nequilibrium critical properties. A dynamic renormalization-group theory is\ndeveloped to account for the behavior. The weak driving may give rise to\nseveral time scales depending on its form and thus rich nonequilibrium\nphenomena of various regimes and their crossovers, negative susceptibilities,\nas well as violation of fluctuation-dissipation theorem. An initial condition\nthat can be in either equilibrium or nonequilibrium but has longer correlations\nthan the driving scales also results in a unique regime and complicates the\nsituation. Implication of the results on measurement is also discussed. The\ntheory may shed light on study of other nonequilibrium systems and even\nnonlinear science.\n", "  The paper outlines a new development in the Contextuality-by-Default theory\nas applied to finite systems of binary random variables. The logic and\nprinciples of the original theory remain unchanged, but the definition of\ncontextuality of a system of random variables is now based on multimaximal\nrather than maximal couplings of the variables that measure the same property\nin different contexts: a system is considered noncontextual if these\nmultimaximal couplings are compatible with the distributions of the random\nvariables sharing contexts. A multimaximal coupling is one that is a maximal\ncoupling of any subset (equivalently, of any pair) of the random variables\nbeing coupled. Arguments are presented for why this modified theory is a\nsuperior generalization of the traditional understanding of contextuality in\nquantum mechanics. The modified theory coincides with the previous version in\nthe important case of cyclic systems, which include the systems whose\ncontextuality was most intensively studied in quantum physics and behavioral\nsciences.\n", "  We report an anti-levitation behavior of Landau levels in vanishing magnetic\nfields in a high quality hetero-junction insulated-gated field-effect\ntransistor. We found, in the Landau fan diagram of electron density versus\nmagnetic field, the positions of the magneto-resistance minima at Landau level\nfillings \\nu=4, 5, 6 move below the 'traditional' Landau level line to lower\nelectron densities. Moreover, the even and odd filling factors show\nquantitatively different behaviors in anti-levitation, suggesting that the\nexchange interactions may be important.\n", "  We have performed systemmatic local linear stability analysis on a radially\nstratified infinite self-gravitating cylinder of rotating plasma under the\ninfluence of magnetic field. In order to render the system analytically\ntractable, we have focussed solely on the axisymmetric modes of perturbations.\nUsing cylindrical coordinate system, we have derived the critical linear mass\ndensity of a non-rotating filament required for gravitational collapse to ensue\nin the presence of azimuthal magnetic field. Moreover, for such filaments\nthreaded by axial magnetic field, we show that the growth rates of the modes\nhaving non-zero radial wavenumber are reduced more strongly by the magnetic\nfield than that of the modes having zero radial wavenumber. More importantly,\nour study contributes to the understanding of the stability property of\nrotating astrophysical filaments that are more often than not influenced by\nmagnetic fields. In addition to complementing many relevant numerical studies\nreported the literature, our results on filaments under the influence of\nmagnetic field generalize some of the very recent analytical works\n(e.g.,~\\citet{jog2014}, etc.). For example, here we prove that even a weak\nmagnetic field can play a dominant role in determining stability of the\nfilament when the rotation timescale is larger than the free fall timescale. A\nfilamentary structure with faster rotation is, however, comparatively more\nstable for the same magnetic field. The results reported herein, due to strong\nlocality assumption, are strictly valid for the modes for which one can ignore\nthe radial variations in the density and the magnetic field profiles.\n", "  Using an analytic, axisymmetric approach that includes general relativity,\ncoupled to a condition for pair production deduced from simulations, we derive\ngeneral results about the spatial distribution of pair-producing field lines\nover the pulsar polar cap. In particular, we show that pair production on\nmagnetic field lines operates over only a fraction of the polar cap for an\naligned rotator for general magnetic field configurations, assuming the\nmagnetic field varies spatially on a scale that is larger than the size of the\npolar cap. We compare our result to force-free simulations of a pulsar with a\ndipole surface field and find excellent agreement. Our work has implications\nfor first-principles simulations of pulsar magnetospheres, and for explaining\nobservations of pulsed radio and high-energy emission.\n", "  We study the gauge-independent observables associated with two interesting\nstationary configurations of the Standard Model Higgs potential (extrapolated\nto high energy according to the present state of the art, namely the NNLO): i)\nthe value of the top mass ensuring stability of the SM electroweak minimum, and\nii) the value of the Higgs potential at a rising inflection point. We examine\nin detail and reappraise the experimental and theoretical uncertainties which\nplague their determination, finding that: i) stability of the SM is compatible\nwith the present data at the 1.5 sigma level; ii) despite the large theoretical\nerror plaguing the value of the Higgs potential at a rising inflection point,\napplication of such configuration to models of primordial inflation displays a\n3 sigma tension with the recent bounds on the tensor-to-scalar ratio of\ncosmological perturbations.\n", "  We explore the effect of magnetic field on chiral condensation in QCD via a\nsimple bottom up holographic model which inputs QCD dynamics through the\nrunning of the anomalous dimension of the quark bilinear. Bottom up holography\nis a form of effective field theory and we use it to explore the dependence on\nthe coefficients of the two lowest order terms linking the magnetic field and\nthe quark condensate. In the massless theory, we identify a region of parameter\nspace where magnetic catalysis occurs at zero temperature but inverse magnetic\ncatalysis at temperatures of order the thermal phase transition. The model\nshows similar non-monotonic behaviour in the condensate with B at intermediate\nT as the lattice data. This behaviour is due to the separation of the meson\nmelting and chiral transitions in the holographic framework. The introduction\nof quark mass raises the scale of B where inverse catalysis takes over from\ncatalysis until the inverse catalysis lies outside the regime of validity of\nthe effective description leaving just catalysis.\n", "  We investigate sensing of magnetic fields using quantum spin chains at finite\ntemperature and exploit quantum phase crossovers to improve metrological bounds\non the estimation of the chain parameters. In particular, we analyze the $ XX $\nspin chain and show that the magnetic sensitivity of this system is dictated by\nits adiabatic magnetic susceptibility, which scales extensively (linearly) in\nthe number of spins $ N $. Next, we introduce an iterative feedforward protocol\nthat actively exploits features of quantum phase crossovers to enable\nsuper-extensive scaling of the magnetic sensitivity. Moreover, we provide\nexperimentally realistic observables to saturate the quantum metrological\nbounds. Finally, we also address magnetic sensing in the Heisenberg $ XY $ spin\nchain.\n", "  Photoionization of two buckyonions, C$_{60}$@C$_{240}$ and C$_{20}$@C$_{60}$,\nis investigated by means of time-dependent density-functional theory (TDDFT).\nThe TDDFT-based photoabsorption spectrum of C$_{60}$@C$_{240}$, calculated in a\nbroad photon energy range, resembles the sum of spectra of the two isolated\nfullerenes, thus illustrating the absence of strong plasmonic coupling between\nthe fullerenes which was proposed earlier. The calculated spectrum of the\nsmaller buckyonion, C$_{20}$@C$_{60}$, differs significantly from the sum of\nthe cross sections of the individual fullerenes because of strong geometrical\ndistortion of the system. The contribution of collective electron excitations\narising in individual fullerenes is evaluated by means of plasmon resonance\napproximation (PRA). An extension of the PRA formalism is presented, which\nallows for the study of collective electron excitations in multishell\nfullerenes under photon impact. An advanced analysis of photoionization of\nbuckyonions, performed using modern computational and analytical approaches,\nprovides valuable information on the response of complex molecular systems to\nthe external electromagnetic field.\n", "  We study fermions that are gauge-coupled to a cavity mode via Raman-assisted\nhopping in a one dimensional lattice. For an infinite lattice, we find a\nsuperradiant phase with infinitesimal pumping threshold which induces a\ndirected particle flow. We explore the fate of this flow in a finite lattice\nwith boundaries, studying the non-equilibrium dynamics including fluctuation\neffects. The short time dynamics is dominated by superradiance, while the long\ntime behaviour is governed by cavity fluctuations. We show that the steady\nstate in the finite lattice is not unique, and can be understood in terms of\ncoherent bosonic excitations above a Fermi surface in real space.\n", "  We study a restricted class of correlator product states (CPS) for a\nspin-half chain in which each spin is contained in just two overlapping\nplaquettes. This class is also a restriction upon matrix product states (MPS)\nwith local dimension $2^n$ ($n$ being the size of the overlapping regions of\nplaquettes) equal to the bond dimension. We investigate the trade-off between\ngains in efficiency due to this restriction against losses in fidelity. The\ntime-dependent variational principle formulated for these states is numerically\nvery stable. Moreover, it shows significant gains in efficiency compared to the\nnaively related matrix product states - the evolution or optimisation scales as\n$2^{3n}$ for the correlator product states versus $2^{4n}$ for the unrestricted\nmatrix product state. However, much of this advantage is offset by a\nsignificant reduction in fidelity. Correlator product states break the local\nHilbert space symmetry by the explicit selection of a local basis. We\ninvestigate this dependence in detail and formulate the broad principles under\nwhich correlator product states may be a useful tool. In particular, we find\nthat scaling with overlap/bond order may be more stable with correlator product\nstates allowing a more efficient extraction of critical exponents - we present\nan example in which the use of correlator product states is several orders of\nmagnitude quicker than matrix product states.\n", "  We report single crystal X-ray diffraction measurements on\nNa$_2$Ti$_{2}Pn_{2}$O ($Pn$ = As, Sb) which reveal a charge superstructure that\nappears below the density wave transitions previously observed in bulk data.\nFrom symmetry-constrained structure refinements we establish that the\nassociated distortion mode can be described by two propagation vectors, ${\\bf\nq}_{1} = (1/2, 0, l)$ and ${\\bf q}_{2} = (0, 1/2, l)$, with $l=0$ (Sb) or $l =\n1/2$ (As), and primarily involves in-plane displacements of the Ti atoms\nperpendicular to the Ti--O bonds. The results provide direct evidence for\nphonon-assisted charge density wave order in Na$_2$Ti$_{2}Pn_{2}$O and identify\na proximate ordered phase that could compete with superconductivity in doped\nBaTi$_{2}$Sb$_{2}$O.\n", "  The capacity of classical channels is convex. This is not the case for the\nquantum capacity of a channel: the capacity of a mixture of different quantum\nchannels exceeds the mixture of the individual capacities and thus is\nnon-convex. Here we show that this effect goes beyond the quantum capacity and\nholds for the private and classical environment-assisted capacities of quantum\nchannels.\n", "  General probabilistic theories are designed to provide operationally the most\ngeneral probabilistic models including both classical and quantum theories. In\nthis letter, we introduce a systematic method to construct a series of\nentropies, all of which generalize Shannon entropy in classical system and von\nNeumann entropy in quantum system. Using these entropies, the Holevo bound, an\nupper bound of the accessible information from a quantum system, is generalized\nto hold in any general probabilistic theory.\n", "  Calculation of the differential cross section for the dielectronic\nrecombination with two-electron uranium within the framework of QED is\npresented. The polarization of the emitted photon is investigated. The\ncontributions of the Breit interaction and the interference of the photon\nmultipoles are studied.\n", "  We report the observation of an unexpected, long-range field-effect in\nWTe$_2$ devices, leading to large gate-induced changes of the transport\nproperties of crystals much thicker than the electrostatic screening length.\nThe phenomenon --which manifests itself very differently from the conventional\nfield-effect-- originates from the non-local nature of transport in the devices\nthat are thinner than the carrier mean free path, because of the dominant role\nof surface scattering. We reproduce theoretically the gate dependence of the\nmeasured classical and quantum magneto-transport in all detail, and show that\nthe phenomenon is caused by the gate-tuning of the bulk carrier mobility by\nchanging the scattering at the surface. Our results demonstrate the possibility\nto gate tune the electronic properties deep in the interior of conducting\nmaterials, avoiding limitations imposed by electrostatic screening.\n", "  We examine the exact equation of motion for the relaxation of populations of\nstrongly correlated electrons after a nonequilibrium excitation by a pulsed\nfield, and prove that the populations do not change when the Green's functions\nhave no average time dependence. We show how the average time dependence enters\ninto the equation of motion to lowest order and describe what governs the\nrelaxation process of the electron populations in the long-time limit. While\nthis result may appear, on the surface, to be required by any steady-state\nsolution, the proof is nontrivial, and provides new critical insight into how\nnonequilibrium populations relax, which goes beyond the assumption that they\nthermalize via a simple relaxation rate determined by the imaginary part of the\nself-energy, or that they can be described by a quasi-equilibrium condition\nwith a Fermi-Dirac distribution and a time-dependent temperature. We also\ndiscuss the implications of this result to approximate theories, which may not\nsatisfy the exact relation in the equation of motion.\n", "  We analyse a generalised quantum error correction code against photon loss\nwhere a logical qubit is encoded into a subspace of a single oscillator mode\nthat is spanned by distinct multi-component cat states (coherent-state\nsuperpositions). We present a systematic code construction that includes the\nextension of an existing one-photon-loss code to higher numbers of losses. When\nsubject to a photon loss (amplitude damping) channel, the encoded qubits are\nshown to exhibit a cyclic behaviour where the code and error spaces each\ncorrespond to certain multiples of losses, half of which can be corrected. As\nanother generalisation we also discuss how to protect logical qudits against\nphoton losses, and as an application we consider a one-way quantum\ncommunication scheme, in which the encoded qubits are periodically recovered\nwhile the coherent-state amplitudes are restored as well at regular intervals.\n", "  The sub-population of quasars reddened by intrinsic or intervening clouds of\ndust are known to be underrepresented in optical quasar surveys. By defining a\ncomplete parent sample of the brightest and spatially unresolved quasars in the\nCOSMOS field, we quantify to which extent this sub-population is fundamental to\nour understanding of the true population of quasars. By using the available\nmultiwavelength data of various surveys in the COSMOS field, we built a parent\nsample of 33 quasars brighter than $J=20$ mag, identified by reliable X-ray to\nradio wavelength selection techniques. Spectroscopic follow-up with the\nNOT/ALFOSC was carried out for four candidate quasars that had not been\ntargeted previously to obtain a 100\\% redshift completeness of the sample. The\npopulation of high $A_V$ quasars (HAQs), a specific sub-population of quasars\nselected from optical/near-infrared photometry, is found to contribute\n$21\\%^{+9}_{-5}$ of the parent sample. The full population of bright spatially\nunresolved quasars represented by our parent sample consists of\n$39\\%^{+9}_{-8}$ reddened quasars defined by having $A_V>0.1$, and\n$21\\%^{+9}_{-5}$ of the sample having $E(B-V)>0.1$ assuming the extinction\ncurve of the Small Magellanic Cloud. We show that the HAQ selection works well\nfor selecting reddened quasars, but some are missed because their optical\nspectra are too blue to pass the $g-r$ color cut in the HAQ selection. This is\neither due to a low degree of dust reddening or anomalous spectra. We find that\nthe fraction of quasars with contributing light from the host galaxy is most\ndominant at $z \\lesssim 1$. At higher redshifts the population of spatially\nunresolved quasars selected by our parent sample is found to be representative\nof the full population at $J<20$ mag. This work quantifies the bias against\nreddened quasars in studies that are based solely on optical surveys.\n", "  The orbital magnetic susceptibility of an electron gas in a periodic\npotential depends not only on the zero field energy spectrum but also on the\ngeometric structure of cell-periodic Bloch states which encodes interband\neffects. In addition to the Berry curvature, we explicitly relate the orbital\nsusceptibility of two-band models to a quantum metric tensor defining a\ndistance in Hilbert space. Within a simple tight-binding model allowing for a\ntunable Bloch geometry, we show that interband effects are essential even in\nthe absence of Berry curvature. We also show that for a flat band model, the\nquantum metric gives rise to a very strong orbital paramagnetism.\n", "  We present results of an experiment where, using a 200 GW CO2 laser seed, a\n65 MeV electron beam was decelerated down to 35 MeV in a 54 cm long strongly\ntapered helical magnetic undulator, extracting over 30$\\%$ of the initial\nelectron beam energy to coherent radiation. These results demonstrate\nunparalleled electro-optical conversion efficiencies for a relativistic beam in\nan undulator field and represent an important step in the development of high\npeak and average power coherent radiation sources.\n", "  Doubly magic nuclei have a simple structure and are the cornerstones for\nentire regions of the nuclear chart. Theoretical insights into the supposedly\ndoubly magic $^{78}$Ni and its neighbors are challenging because of the extreme\nneutron-to-proton ratio and the proximity of the continuum. We predict the\n$J^\\pi=2_1^+$ state in $^{78}$Ni from a correlation with the $J^\\pi=2_1^+$\nstate in $^{48}$Ca using chiral nucleon-nucleon and three-nucleon interactions.\nOur results confirm that $^{78}$Ni is doubly magic, and the predicted low-lying\nstates of $^{79,80}$Ni open the way for shell-model studies of many more rare\nisotopes.\n", "  Intriguing lattice dynamics has been predicted for aperiodic crystals that\ncontain incommensurate substructures. Here we report inelastic neutron\nscattering measurements of phonon and magnon dispersions in Sr14Cu24O41, which\ncontains incommensurate one-dimensional (1D) chain and two-dimensional (2D)\nladder substructures. Two distinct pseudoacoustic phonon modes, corresponding\nto the sliding motion of one sublattice against the other, are observed for\natomic motions polarized along the incommensurate axis. In the long wavelength\nlimit, it is found that the sliding mode shows a remarkably small energy gap of\n1.7-1.9 meV, indicating very weak interactions between the two incommensurate\nsublattices. The measurements also reveal a gapped and steep linear magnon\ndispersion of the ladder sublattice. The high group velocity of this magnon\nbranch and weak coupling with acoustic and pseudoacoustic phonons can explain\nthe large magnon thermal conductivity in Sr14Cu24O41 crystals. In addition, the\nmagnon specific heat is determined from the measured total specific heat and\nphonon density of states, and exhibits a Schottky anomaly due to gapped magnon\nmodes of the spin chains. These findings offer new insights into the phonon and\nmagnon dynamics and thermal transport properties of incommensurate magnetic\ncrystals that contain low-dimensional substructures.\n", "  Even tin isotopes of mass number $A = 108 \\sim 124$ are calculated with\nrealistic interactions in the generalized-seniority approximation of the\nnuclear shell model. For each nucleus, we compute the lowest ten thousand\nstates ($5000$ of each parity) up to around $8$ MeV in excitation energy, by\nallowing as many as four broken pairs. The lowest fifty eigen energies of each\nparity are compared with the exact results of the large-scale shell-model\ncalculation. The wavefunctions of the mid-shell nuclei show a clear pattern of\nthe stepwise breakup of condensed coherent pairs with increasing excitation\nenergy. We also compute in the canonical ensemble the thermal properties --\nlevel density, entropy, and specific heat -- in relation to the thermal pairing\nphase transition.\n", "  Learning and memory are acquired through long-lasting changes in synapses. In\nthe simplest models, such synaptic potentiation typically leads to runaway\nexcitation, but in reality there must exist processes that robustly preserve\noverall stability of the neural system dynamics. How is this accomplished?\nVarious approaches to this basic question have been considered. Here we propose\na particularly compelling and natural mechanism for preserving stability of\nlearning neural systems. This mechanism is based on the global processes by\nwhich metabolic resources are distributed to the neurons by glial cells.\nSpecifically, we introduce and study a model comprised of two interacting\nnetworks: a model neural network interconnected by synapses which undergo\nspike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP); and a model glial network\ninterconnected by gap junctions which diffusively transport metabolic resources\namong the glia and, ultimately, to neural synapses where they are consumed. Our\nmain result is that the biophysical constraints imposed by diffusive transport\nof metabolic resources through the glial network can prevent runaway growth of\nsynaptic strength, both during ongoing activity and during learning. Our\nfindings suggest a previously unappreciated role for glial transport of\nmetabolites in the feedback control stabilization of neural network dynamics\nduring learning.\n", "  The layered ternary compound TaIrTe$_4$ has been predicted to be a type-II\nWeyl semimetal with only four Weyl points just above the Fermi energy.\nPerforming magnetotransport measurements on this material we find that the\nresistivity does not saturate for fields up to 70 T and follows a $ \\rho \\sim\nB^{1.5}$ dependence. Angular-dependent de Haas-van Alphen (dHvA) measurements\nreveal four distinct frequencies. Analyzing these magnetic quantum oscillations\nby use of density functional theory (DFT) calculations we establish that in\nTaIrTe$_4$ the Weyl points are located merely $\\sim$ 40-50 meV above the\nchemical potential, suggesting that the chemical potential can be tuned into\nthe four Weyl nodes by moderate chemistry or external pressure, maximizing\ntheir chiral effects on electronic and magnetotransport properties.\n", "  In a joint theoretical and experimental investigation we show that a series\nof transition metals with strained body-centered cubic lattice ---W, Ta, Nb,\nand Mo--- host surface states that are topologically protected by mirror\nsymmetry. Our finding extends the class of topologically nontrivial systems by\ntopological crystalline transition metals. The investigation is based on\nindependent calculations of the electronic structures and of topological\ninvariants, the results of which agree with established properties of the\nDirac-type surface state in W(110). To further support our prediction, we\ninvestigate both experimentally by spin-resolved inverse photoemission and\ntheoretically an unoccupied topologically nontrivial surface state in Ta(110).\n", "  Understanding the effect of vibrations in optically active nano systems is\ncrucial for successfully implementing applications in molecular-based\nelectro-optical devices, quantum information communications, single photon\nsources, and fluorescent markers for biological measurements. Here, we present\na first-principles microscopic description of the role of phonons on the\nisotopic shift presented in the optical emission spectrum associated to the\nnegatively charged silicon-vacancy color center in diamond. We use the\nspin-boson model and estimate the electron-phonon interactions using a\nsymmetrized molecular description of the electronic states and a force-constant\nmodel to describe molecular vibrations. Group theoretical arguments and\ndynamical symmetry breaking are presented in order to explain the optical\nproperties of the zero-phonon line and the isotopic shift of the phonon\nsideband.\n", "  We investigate the emergent open dynamics of a quantum system that undergoes\nrapid repeated unitary interactions with a sequence of ancillary systems. We\nstudy in detail how decoherence appears as a subleading effect when a quantum\nsystem is 'bombarded' by a quick succession of ancillas. In the most general\ncase, these ancillas are a) taken from an ensemble of quantum systems of\ndifferent dimensions, b) prepared in different states, and c) interacting with\nthe system through different Hamiltonians. We derive an upper bound on\ndecoherence rates in this regime, and show how a rich variety of phenomena in\nopen dynamics (such as projection, thermalization, purification, and dephasing)\ncan emerge out of our general model of repeated interaction. Furthermore, we\nshow a fundamental link between the strength of the leading order dissipation\nand the intrinsic \"unpredictability\" in the system-ancilla interaction. We also\ndiscuss how these results encompass and extend results obtained with other\nearlier models of repeated interaction.\n", "  We consider nonlocal correlations in iron in the vicinity of the\n$\\alpha$-$\\gamma$ phase transition within the spin-rotationally-invariant\ndynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) approach, combined with the recently\nproposed spin-fermion model of iron. The obtained nonlocal corrections to DMFT\nyield a decrease of the Curie temperature of the $\\alpha$ phase, leading to an\nagreement with its experimental value. We show that the corresponding nonlocal\ncorrections to the energy of the $\\alpha$ phase are crucially important to\nobtain the proximity of energies of $\\alpha$ and $\\gamma$ phases in the\nvicinity of the iron $\\alpha$-$\\gamma$ transformation.\n", "  We present an effective Hamiltonian based real-space approach for studying\nthe weak-coupling Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) to the strong-coupling\nBose-Einstein condensate (BEC) crossover in the two-dimensional attractive\nHubbard model at finite temperatures. We introduce and justify an effective\nclassical Hamiltonian to describe the thermal fluctuations of the relevant\nauxiliary fields. Our results for $T_c$ and phase diagrams compare very well\nwith those obtained from more sophisticated and {\\it cpu}-intensive numerical\nmethods. We demonstrate that the method works in the presence of disorder and\nis useful for a real-space description of the effect of disorder on\nsuperconductivity. From a combined analysis of the superconducting order\nparameter, the distribution of auxiliary fields and the quasiparticle density\nof states, we identify the regions of metallic, insulating, superconducting and\npseudogapped behavior. Our finding of the importance of phase fluctuations for\nthe pseudogap behavior is consistent with the conclusions drawn from recent\nexperiments on NbN superconductors. The method can be generalized to study\nsuperconductors with non-trivial order parameter symmetries by identifying the\nrelevant auxiliary variables.\n", "  Many-component electron-hole plasma is considered in the Coupled Quantum\nWells (CQW). It is found that the homogeneous state of the plasma is unstable\nif the carrier density is sufficiently small. The instability results in the\nbreakdown into two coexisting phase - a low-density gas phase and a\nhigh-density electron-hole liquid. The homogeneous state of the electron-hole\nliquid is stable if the distance between the quantum wells l is sufficiently\nsmall. However, as the distance l increases and reaches a certain critical\nvalue, the plasmon spectrum of the electron-hole liquid becomes unstable.\nHereupon, a quantum phase transition occurs, resulting in the appearance of the\ncharge density waves of finite amplitude in both quantum wells. The strong mass\nrenormalization and the strong Z-factor renormalization are found for the\nelectron-hole liquid as the quantum phase transition occurs.\n", "  It is shown, using direct numerical simulations and laboratory experiments\ndata, that distributed chaos is often tuned to large scale coherent motions in\nanisotropic inhomogeneous turbulence. The examples considered are: fully\ndeveloped turbulent boundary layer (range of coherence: $14 < y^{+} < 80$),\nturbulent thermal convection (in a horizontal cylinder), and Cuette-Taylor\nflow. Two ways of the tuning have been described: one via fundamental frequency\n(wavenumber) and another via subharmonic (period doubling). For the second way\nthe large scale coherent motions are a natural component of distributed chaos.\nIn all considered cases spontaneous breaking of space translational symmetry is\naccompanied by reflexional symmetry breaking.\n", "  A gravitationally collapsed object can bounce-out from its horizon via a\ntunnelling process that violates the classical equations in a finite region.\nSince tunnelling is a non-perturbative phenomenon, it cannot be described in\nterms of quantum fluctuations around a classical solution and a background-free\nformulation of quantum gravity is needed to analyze it. Here we use Loop\nQuantum Gravity to compute the amplitude for this process, in a first\napproximation. The amplitude determines the tunnelling time as a function of\nthe mass. This is the key information to evaluate the astrophysical relevance\nof this process. The calculation offers a template and a concrete example of\nhow a background-free quantum theory of gravity can be used to compute a\nrealistical observable quantity.\n", "  Forward rapidity $J/\\psi$ meson production in proton-nucleus collisions can\nbe an important constraint of descriptions of the small-$x$ nuclear\nwavefunction. In an earlier work we studied this process using a dipole cross\nsection satisfying the Balitsky-Kovchegov equation, fit to HERA inclusive data\nand consistently extrapolated to the nuclear case using a standard Woods-Saxon\ndistribution. In this paper we present further calculations of these cross\nsections, studying the mean transverse momentum of the meson and the dependence\non collision centrality. We also extend the calculation to backward rapidities\nusing nuclear parton distribution functions. We show that the parametrization\nis overall rather consistent with the available experimental data. However,\nthere is a tendency towards a too strong centrality dependence. This can be\ntraced back to the rather small transverse area occupied by small-$x$ gluons in\nthe nucleon that is seen in the HERA data, compared to the total inelastic\nnucleon-nucleon cross section.\n", "  Boson sampling is the problem of generating a quantum bit stream whose\naverage is the permanent of a $n\\times n$ matrix. The bitstream is created as\nthe output of a prototype quantum computing device with $n$ input photons. It\nis a fundamental challenge to verify boson sampling, and the question of how\noutput count rates scale with matrix size $n$ is crucial. Here we apply results\nfrom random matrix theory to establish scaling laws for average count rates in\nboson sampling experiments with arbitrary inputs and losses. The results show\nthat, even with losses included, verification of nonclassical behaviour at\nlarge $n$ values is indeed possible.\n", "  We report growth and characterization of a coupled quantum dot structure that\nutilizes nanowire templates for selective epitaxy of radial heterostructures.\nThe starting point is a zinc blende InAs nanowire with thin segments of\nwurtzite structure. These segments have dual roles: they act as tunnel barriers\nfor electron transport in the InAs core, and they also locally suppress growth\nof a GaSb shell, resulting in coaxial InAs-GaSb quantum dots with integrated\nelectrical probes. The parallel quantum dot structure hosts spatially separated\nelectrons and holes that interact due to the type-II broken gap of InAs-GaSb\nheterojunctions. The Coulomb blockade in the electron and hole transport is\nstudied, and periodic interactions of electrons and holes are observed and can\nbe reproduced by modeling. Distorted Coulomb diamonds indicate voltage-induced\nground-state transitions, possibly a result of changes in the spatial\ndistribution of holes in the thin GaSb shell.\n", "  We present multi-epoch mid-infrared (IR) photometry and the optical discovery\nobservations of the \"impostor\" supernova (SN) 2010da in NGC 300 using new and\narchival Spitzer Space Telescope images and ground-based observatories. The\nmid-IR counterpart of SN 2010da was detected as SPIRITS 14bme in the SPitzer\nInfraRed Intensive Transient Survey (SPIRITS), an ongoing systematic search for\nIR transients. A sharp increase in the 3.6 $\\mu$m flux followed by a rapid\ndecrease measured ~150 d before and ~80 d after the initial outburst,\nrespectively, reveal a mid-IR counterpart to the coincident optical and high\nluminosity X-ray outbursts. At late times after the outburst (~2000 d), the 3.6\nand 4.5 $\\mu$m emission increased to over a factor of 2 times the progenitor\nflux. We attribute the re-brightening mid-IR emission to continued dust\nproduction and increasing luminosity of the surviving system associated with SN\n2010da. We analyze the evolution of the dust temperature, mass, luminosity, and\nequilibrium temperature radius in order to resolve the nature of SN 2010da. We\naddress the leading interpretation of SN 2010da as an eruption from a luminous\nblue variable (LBV) high-mass X-ray binary (HMXB) system. We propose that SN\n2010da is instead a supergiant (sg)B[e]-HMXB based on similar luminosities and\ndust masses exhibited by two other known sgB[e]-HMXB systems. Additionally, the\nSN 2010da progenitor occupies a similar region on a mid-IR color-magnitude\ndiagram (CMD) with known sgB[e] stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud. The lower\nlimit estimated for the orbital eccentricity of the sgB[e]-HMXB (e>0.82) from\nX-ray luminosity measurements is high compared to known sgHMXBs and supports\nthe claim that SN 2010da may be associated with a newly formed HMXB system.\n", "  In this paper, measurement results and experimental methodology are presented\non the determination of multiplication distributions of avalanches initiated by\nsingle electron in GEM foils. The measurement relies on the amplification of\nphotoelectrons by the GEM under study, which is subsequently amplified in an\nMWPC for signal enhancement and readout. The intrinsic detector resolution,\nnamely the sigma-over-mean ratio of the multiplication. distribution is also\nelaborated. Small gain dependence of the shape of the avalanche response\ndistribution is observed in the range of net effective gain of 15 to 100. The\ndistribution has an exponentially decaying tail at large amplitudes. At small\namplitudes, the applied working gas is seen to have a well visible effect on\nthe shape of the multiplication distribution. Equivalently, the working gas has\nan influence on the intrinsic detector resolution of GEMs via suppression of\nthe low amplitude responses. A sigma-over-mean ratio of 0.75 was reached using\na neon based mixture, whereas other gases provided an intrinsic detector\nresolution closer to 1, meaning a multiplication distribution closer to the\nlow-field limit exponential case.\n", "  We consider rigidly rotating states in thermal equilibrium on static\nspherically symmetric spacetimes. Using the Maxwell-Juttner equilibrium\ndistribution function, onstructed as a solution of the relativistic Boltzmann\nequation, the equilibrium particle flow four-vector, stress-energy tensor and\nthe transport coefficients in the Marle model are computed. Their properties\nare discussed in view of the topology of the speed-of-light surface induced by\nthe rotation for two classes of spacetimes: maximally symmetric (Minkowski, de\nSitter and anti-de Sitter) and charged (Reissner-Nordstrom) black-hole\nspacetimes. To facilitate our analysis, we employ a non-holonomic comoving\ntetrad field, obtained unambiguously by applying a Lorentz boost on a fixed\nbackground tetrad.\n", "  We prove that a system of non-interacting electrons proximity coupled to a\nconventional s-wave superconductor cannot realize a time reversal invariant\ntopological phase. This is done by showing that for such a system, in either\none or two dimensions, the topological invariant of the corresponding symmetry\nclass (DIII) is always trivial. Our results suggest that the pursuit of\nMajorana bound states in time-reversal invariant systems should be aimed at\ninteracting systems or at proximity to unconventional superconductors.\n", "  The detection of quasars at $z>6$ unveils the presence of supermassive black\nholes (BHs) of a few billion solar masses. The rapid formation process of these\nextreme objects remains a fascinating and open issue. Such discovery implies\nthat seed black holes must have formed early on, and grown via either rapid\naccretion or BH/galaxy mergers. In this theoretical review, we discuss in\ndetail various BH seed formation mechanisms and the physical processes at play\nduring their assembly. We discuss the three most popular BH formation\nscenarios, involving the (i) core-collapse of massive stars, (ii) dynamical\nevolution of dense nuclear star clusters, (iii) collapse of a protogalactic\nmetal free gas cloud. This article aims at giving a broad introduction and an\noverview of the most advanced research in the field.\n", "  Many deep wide-band wide-field radio interferometric surveys are being\ndesigned to accurately measure intensities, spectral indices and polarization\nproperties of faint source populations. In this paper we compare various\nwideband imaging methods to evaluate the accuracy to which intensities and\nspectral indices of sources close to the confusion limit can be reconstructed.\nWe simulated a wideband single-pointing (C-array, L-Band (1-2GHz)) and\n46-pointing mosaic(D-array, C-Band (4-8GHz)) JVLA observation using realistic\nbrightness distribution ranging from $1\\mu$Jy to $100m$Jy and time-,frequency-,\npolarization- and direction-dependent instrumental effects. The main results\nfrom these comparisons are (a) errors in the reconstructed intensities and\nspectral indices are larger for weaker sources even in the absence of simulated\nnoise, (b) errors are systematically lower for joint reconstruction methods\n(such as MT-MFS) along with A-Projection for accurate primary beam correction,\nand (c) use of MT-MFS for image reconstruction eliminates Clean-bias (which is\npresent otherwise). Auxiliary tests include solutions for deficiencies of data\npartitioning methods (e.g. the use of masks to remove clean bias and hybrid\nmethods to remove sidelobes from sources left undeconvolved), the effect of\nsources not at pixel centers and the consequences of various other numerical\napproximations within software implementations. This paper also demonstrates\nthe level of detail at which such simulations must be done in order to reflect\nreality, enable one to systematically identify specific reasons for every trend\nthat is observed and to estimate scientifically defensible imaging performance\nmetrics and the associated computational complexity of the algorithms/analysis\nprocedures.\n", "  Despite intensive studies of protoplanetary disks, there is still no reliable\nway to determine their total mass and their surface density distribution,\nquantities that are crucial for describing both the structure and the evolution\nof disks up to the formation of planets. The goal of this work is to use less\nabundant CO isotopologues, whose detection is routine for ALMA, to infer the\ngas mass of disks. Isotope-selective effects need to be taken into account in\nthe analysis, because they can significantly modify CO isotopologues line\nintensities. CO isotope-selective photodissociation has been implemented in the\nphysical-chemical code DALI and 800 disk models have been run for a range of\ndisk and stellar parameters. Dust and gas temperature structures have been\ncomputed self-consistently, together with a chemical calculation of the main\nspecies. Both disk structure and stellar parameters have been investigated.\nTotal fluxes have been ray-traced for different CO isotopologues and for\nvarious transitions for different inclinations. A combination of 13CO and C18O\ntotal intensities allows inference of the total disk mass, although with\nnon-negligible uncertainties. These can be overcome by employing spatially\nresolved observations, i.e. the disk's radial extent and inclination.\nComparison with parametric models shows differences at the factor of a few\nlevel, especially for extremely low and high disk masses. Finally, total line\nintensities for different CO isotopologue and for various low-J transitions are\nprovided and are fitted to simple formulae. The effects of a lower gas-phase\ncarbon abundance and different gas/dust ratios are investigated as well, and\ncomparison with other tracers is made. Disk masses can be determined within a\nfactor of a few by comparing CO isotopologue lines observations with the\nsimulated line fluxes, modulo the uncertainties in the volatile elemental\nabundances.\n", "  Geographical features such as mountain ranges or big lakes and inland seas\noften result in large closed loops in high voltage AC power grids. Sizable\ncirculating power flows have been recorded around such loops, which take up\ntransmission line capacity and dissipate but do not deliver electric power.\nPower flows in high voltage AC transmission grids are dominantly governed by\nvoltage angle differences between connected buses, much in the same way as\nJosephson currents depend on phase differences between tunnel-coupled\nsuperconductors. From this previously overlooked similarity we argue here that\ncirculating power flows in AC power grids are analogous to supercurrents\nflowing in superconducting rings and in rings of Josephson junctions. We\ninvestigate how circulating power flows can be created and how they behave in\nthe presence of ohmic dissipation. We show how changing operating conditions\nmay generate them, how significantly more power is ohmically dissipated in\ntheir presence and how they are topologically protected, even in the presence\nof dissipation, so that they persist when operating conditions are returned to\ntheir original values. We identify three mechanisms for creating circulating\npower flows, (i) by loss of stability of the equilibrium state carrying no\ncirculating loop flow, (ii) by tripping of a line traversing a large loop in\nthe network and (iii) by reclosing a loop that tripped or was open earlier.\nBecause voltage angles are uniquely defined, circulating power flows can take\non only discrete values, much in the same way as circulation around vortices is\nquantized in superfluids.\n", "  We study the temperature dependence of nuclear magnetic relaxation (NMR)\nrates to detect a sign of topological superconductivity in doped topological\ninsulators, such as $M$($=$Cu,Nb,Sr)$_{x}$Bi$_{2}$Se$_{3}$ and\nSn$_{1-x}$In$_{x}$Te. The Hebel-Slichter coherence effect below a critical\ntemperature Tc depends on the superconducting states predicted by a minimal\nmodel of doped topological insulators. In a nodal anisotropic topological state\nsimilar to the ABM-phase in $^{3}$He, the NMR rate has a conventional $s$-wave\nlike coherence peak below Tc. In contrast, in a fully-gapped isotropic\ntopological superconducting state, this rate below Tc exhibits an anti-peak\nprofile. Moreover, in a two-fold in-plane anisotropic topological\nsuperconducting state, there is no coherence effect, which is similar to that\nin a chiral $p$-wave state. Thus, we reveal that the NMR rates shed light on\nunconventional superconductivity in doped topological insulators.\n", "  In the previous papers in this series, we have measured the stellar and \\hi\ncontent in a sample of edge-on galaxies. In the present paper, we perform a\nsimultaneous rotation curve and vertical force field gradient decomposition for\nfive of these edge-on galaxies. The rotation curve decomposition provides a\nmeasure of the radial dark matter potential, while the vertical force field\ngradient provide a measure of the vertical dark matter potential. We fit dark\nmatter halo models to these potentials. Using our \\hi self-absorption results,\nwe find that a typical dark matter halo has a less dense core\n($0.094\\pm0.230$\\,M$_\\odot$/pc$^3$) compared to an optically thin \\hi model\n($0.150\\pm0.124$\\,M$_\\odot$/pc$^3$). The HI self-absorption dark matter halo\nhas a longer scale length $R_c$ of $1.42\\pm 3.48$\\,kpc, versus $1.10\\pm\n1.81$\\,kpc for the optically thin HI model. The median halo shape is spherical,\nat $q=1.0\\pm0.6$ (self-absorbing \\hi), while it is prolate at $q=1.5\\pm0.6$ for\nthe optically thin. Our best results were obtained for ESO\\,274-G001 and\nUGC\\,7321, for which we were able to measure the velocity dispersion in Paper\nIII. These two galaxies have drastically different halo shapes, with one oblate\nand one strongly prolate. Overall, we find that the many assumptions required\nmake this type of analysis susceptible to errors.\n", "  We present predictions of the binding energy per nucleon and the neutron skin\nthickness in highly neutron-rich isotopes of Oxygen, Magnesium, and Aluminum.\nThe calculations are carried out at and below the neutron drip line as\npredicted by our model. The nuclear properties are obtained via an energy\nfunctional whose input is the equation of state of isospin-asymmetric infinite\nmatter. The latter is based on a microscopic derivation of the energy per\nparticle in neutron matter applying chiral few-nucleon forces together with a\nphenomenological model for the equation of state of symmetric nuclear matter.\nWe highlight the impact of the neutron matter equation of state at different\norders of chiral effective field theory on neutron skins and the binding energy\nper particle and quantify the uncertainty carried by our predictions.\n", "  We present RoadMapping, a full-likelihood dynamical modelling machinery that\naims to recover the Milky Way's (MW) gravitational potential from large samples\nof stars in the Galactic disk. RoadMapping models the observed positions and\nvelocities of stars with a parametrized, three-integral distribution function\n(DF) in a parametrized axisymmetric potential. We investigate through\ndifferential test cases with idealized mock data how the breakdown of model\nassumptions and data properties affect constraints on the potential and DF. Our\nkey results are: (i) If the MW's true potential is not included in the assumed\nmodel potential family, we can - in the axisymmetric case - still find a robust\nestimate for the potential, with only <~ 10% difference in surface density\nwithin |z| <= 1.1 kpc inside the observed volume. (ii) Modest systematic\ndifferences between the true and model DF are inconsequential. E.g, when\nbinning stars to define sub-populations with simple DFs, binning errors do not\naffect the modelling as long as the DF parameters of neighbouring bins differ\nby < 20%. In addition, RoadMapping ensures unbiased potential estimates for\neither (iii) small misjudgements of the spatial selection function (i.e., <~\n15% at the survey volume's edge), (iv) if distances are known to within 10%, or\n(v) if proper motion uncertainties are known within 10% or are smaller than\ndelta mu <~ 1 mas/yr. Challenges are the rapidly increasing computational costs\nfor large sample sizes. Overall, RoadMapping is well suited to making precise\nnew measurements of the MW's potential with data from the upcoming Gaia\nreleases.\n", "  We study the magnetization dynamics of thin-film magnetic elements with\nin-plane magnetization subject to a spin-current flowing perpendicular to the\nfilm plane. We derive a reduced partial differential equation for the in-plane\nmagnetization angle in a weakly damped regime. We then apply this model to\nstudy the experimentally relevant problem of switching of an elliptical element\nwhen the spin-polarization has a component perpendicular to the film plane,\nrestricting the reduced model to a macrospin approximation. The macrospin\nordinary differential equation is treated analytically as a weakly damped\nHamiltonian system, and an orbit-averaging method is used to understand\ntransitions in solution behaviors in terms of a discrete dynamical system. The\npredictions of our reduced model are compared to those of the full\nLandau--Lifshitz--Gilbert--Slonczewski equation for a macrospin.\n", "  Understanding the behavior of light in non-equilibrium scenarios underpins\nmuch of quantum optics and optical physics. While lasers provide a severe\nexample of a non-equilibrium problem, recent interests in the near-equilibrium\nphysics of so-called photon `gases', such as in Bose condensation of light or\nin attempts to make photonic quantum simulators, suggest one re-examine some\nnear-equilibrium cases. Here we consider how a sinusoidal parametric coupling\nbetween two semi-infinite photonic transmission lines leads to the creation and\nflow of photons between the two lines. Our approach provides a photonic analog\nto the Landauer transport formula, and using non-equilbrium Green's functions,\nwe can extend it to the case of an interacting region between two photonic\n`leads' where the sinusoid frequency plays the role of a voltage bias.\nCrucially, we identify both the mathematical framework and the physical regime\nin which photonic transport is directly analogous to electronic transport and\nregimes in which other behavior such as two-mode squeezing can emerge.\n", "  We report the first observation of the 2$^+$ isomer in $^{52}$Co, produced in\nthe $\\beta$ decay of the 0$^+$, $^{52}$Ni ground state. We have observed three\n$\\gamma$-rays at 849, 1910, and 5185 keV characterizing the $\\beta$\nde-excitation of the isomer. We have measured a half-life of 102(6) ms for the\nisomeric state. The Fermi and Gamow-Teller transition strengths for the $\\beta$\ndecay of $^{52m}$Co to $^{52}$Fe have been determined. We also add new\ninformation on the $\\beta$ decay of the 6$^+$, $^{52}$Co ground state, for\nwhich we have measured a half-life of 112(3) ms.\n", "  We study the impact of axion emission in simulations of massive star\nexplosions, as an additional source of energy loss complementary to the\nstandard neutrino emission. The inclusion of this channel shortens the cooling\ntime of the nascent protoneutron star and hence the duration of the neutrino\nsignal. We treat the axion-matter coupling strength as a free parameter to\nstudy its impact on the protoneutron star evolution as well as on the neutrino\nsignal. We furthermore analyze the observability of the enhanced cooling in\ncurrent and next-generation underground neutrino detectors, showing that values\nof the axion mass $m_a \\gtrsim 8 \\times 10^{-3}$ eV can be probed. Therefore a\ngalactic supernova neutrino observation would provide a valuable possibility to\nprobe axion masses in a range within reach of the planned helioscope\nexperiment, the International Axion Observatory (IAXO).\n", "  We investigate the Peierls-Feynman-Bogoliubov variational principle to map\nHubbard models with nonlocal interactions to effective models with only local\ninteractions. We study the renormalization of the local interaction induced by\nnearest-neighbor interaction and assess the quality of the effective Hubbard\nmodels in reproducing observables of the corresponding extended Hubbard models.\nWe compare the renormalization of the local interactions as obtained from\nnumerically exact determinant Quantum Monte Carlo to approximate but more\ngenerally applicable calculations using dual boson, dynamical mean field\ntheory, and the random phase approximation. These more approximate approaches\nare crucial for any application with real materials in mind. Furthermore, we\nuse the dual boson method to calculate observables of the extended Hubbard\nmodels directly and benchmark these against determinant Quantum Monte Carlo\nsimulations of the effective Hubbard model.\n", "  This paper examines the thermoelectric response of a dissipative quantum dot\nheat engine based on the Anderson-Holstein model in two relevant operating\nlimits: (i) when the dot phonon modes are out of equilibrium, and (ii) when the\ndot phonon modes are strongly coupled to a heat bath. In the first case, a\ndetailed analysis of the physics related to the interplay between the quantum\ndot level quantization, the on-site Coulomb interaction and the electron-phonon\ncoupling on the thermoelectric performance reveals that an n-type heat engine\nperforms better than a p-type heat engine. In the second case, with the aid of\nthe dot temperature estimated by incorporating a {\\it{thermometer bath}}, it is\nshown that the dot temperature deviates from the bath temperature as\nelectron-phonon interaction becomes stronger. Consequently, it is demonstrated\nthat the dot temperature controls the direction of phonon heat currents,\nthereby influencing the thermoelectric performance. Finally, the conditions on\nthe maximum efficiency with varying phonon couplings between the dot and all\nthe other macroscopic bodies are analyzed in order to reveal the nature of the\noptimum junction.\n", "  The Yuan-Tseh Lee Array for Microwave Background Anisotropy (AMiBA) is a\nco-planar interferometer array operating at a wavelength of 3mm to measure the\nSunyaev-Zeldovich effect (SZE) of galaxy clusters. In the first phase of\noperation -- with a compact 7-element array with 0.6m antennas (AMiBA-7) -- we\nobserved six clusters at angular scales from 5\\arcmin to 23\\arcmin. Here, we\ndescribe the expansion of AMiBA to a 13-element array with 1.2m antennas\n(AMiBA-13), its subsequent commissioning, and our cluster SZE observing\nprogram. The most important changes compared to AMiBA-7 are (1) array\nre-configuration with baselines ranging from 1.4m to 4.8m covering angular\nscales from 2\\arcmin to 11.5\\arcmin, (2) thirteen new lightweight\ncarbon-fiber-reinforced plastic (CFRP) 1.2m reflectors, and (3) additional\ncorrelators and six new receivers. From the AMiBA-13 SZE observing program, we\npresent here maps of a subset of twelve clusters. In highlights, we combine\nAMiBA-7 and AMiBA-13 observations of Abell 1689 and perform a joint fitting\nassuming a generalized NFW pressure profile. Our cylindrically integrated\nCompton-y values for this cluster are consistent with the BIMA/OVRA, SZA, and\nPlanck results. We report the first targeted SZE detection towards the\noptically selected galaxy cluster RCS J1447+0828, and we demonstrate the\nability of AMiBA SZE data to serve as a proxy for the total cluster mass.\nFinally, we show that our AMiBA-SZE derived cluster masses are consistent with\nrecent lensing mass measurements in the literature.\n", "  Brownian particles interacting via repulsive soft-core potentials can\nspontaneously aggregate, despite repelling each other, and form periodic\ncrystals of particle clusters. We study this phenomenon in low-dimensional\nsituations (one and two dimensions) at two levels of description: performing\nnumerical simulations of the discrete particle dynamics, and by linear and\nnonlinear analysis of the corresponding Dean-Kawasaki equation for the\nmacroscopic particle density. Restricting to low dimensions and neglecting\nfluctuation effects we gain analytical insight into the mechanisms of the\ninstability leading to clustering which turn out to be the interplay between\ndiffusion, the intracluster forces and the forces between neighboring clusters.\nWe show that the deterministic part of the Dean-Kawasaki equation provides a\ngood description of the particle dynamics, including width and shape of the\nclusters, in a wide range of parameters, and analyze with weakly nonlinear\ntechniques the nature of the pattern-forming bifurcation in one and two\ndimensions. Finally, we briefly discuss the case of attractive forces.\n", "  We present new JVLA observations of the high-mass cluster-forming region W51A\nfrom 2 to 16 GHz with resolution ${\\theta}_{fwhm} \\approx$ 0.3 - 0.5\". The data\nreveal a wealth of observational results: (1) Currently-forming, very massive\n(proto-O) stars are traced by o-H2CO $2_{1,1}-2_{1,2}$ emission, suggesting\nthat this line can be used efficiently as a massive protostar tracer. (2) There\nis a spatially distributed population of $\\sim$mJy continuum sources, including\nhypercompact H ii regions and candidate colliding wind binaries, in and around\nthe W51 proto-clusters. (3) There are two clearly detected protoclusters, W51e\nand W51 IRS2, that are gas-rich but may have most of their mass in stars within\ntheir inner $\\sim$ 0.05 pc. The majority of the bolometric luminosity in W51\nmost likely comes from a third population of OB stars between these clusters.\nThe presence of a substantial population of exposed O-stars coincident with a\npopulation of still-forming massive stars, along with a direct measurement of\nthe low mass loss rate via ionized gas outflow from W51 IRS2, together imply\nthat feedback is ineffective at halting star formation in massive\nprotoclusters. Instead, feedback may shut off the large-scale accretion of\ndiffuse gas onto the W51 protoclusters, implying that they are evolving towards\na state of gas exhaustion rather than gas expulsion. Recent theoretical models\npredict gas exhaustion to be a necessary step in the formation of\ngravitationally bound stellar clusters, and our results provide an\nobservational validation of this process.\n", "  Recent observations indicate that the mass of Supermassive Black Holes\n(SMBHs) correlate differently with different galaxy stellar components.\nComparing such observations with the results of \"ab initio\" galaxy formation\nmodels can provide insight on the mechanisms leading to the growth of SMBHs.\nHere we use a state-of-the-art semi-analytic model of galaxy formation to\ninvestigate the correlation of the different galaxy stellar components with the\nmass of the central SMBH. The stellar mass in the disc, in the bulge, and in\nthe pseudo-bulge of galaxies is related to quiescent star formation, to galaxy\ninteractions, and to the loss of angular momentum following disc instabilities,\nrespectively. Consistently with recent findings, we find that while the\npredicted bulge masses are tightly correlated with the SMBH masses, the\ncorrelation between the latter and the galactic discs shows a much larger\nscatter, in particular when bulgeless galaxies are considered. In addition, we\nobtain that the predicted masses of pseudo-bulges shows little or\nno-correlation with the masses of SMBHs. We track the histories of merging,\nstar formation, and SMBH accretion to investigate the physical processes at the\norigin of such findings within the context of cosmological models of galaxy\nformation. Finally, we discuss the effects of variations of our assumed\nfiducial model on the results.\n", "  We investigate the spontaneous emission rate of a two-level quantum emitter\nnext to a composite medium made of randomly distributed metallic inclusions\nembedded in a dielectric host matrix. In the near-field, the Purcell factor can\nbe enhanced by two-orders of magnitude relative to the case of an homogeneous\nmetallic medium, and reaches its maximum precisely at the insulator-metal\ntransition. By unveiling the role of the decay pathways on the emitter's\nlifetime, we demonstrate that, close to the percolation threshold, the\nradiation emission process is dictated by electromagnetic absorption in the\nheterogeneous medium. We show that our findings are robust against change in\nmaterial properties, shape of inclusions, and apply for different effective\nmedium theories as well as for a wide range of transition frequencies.\n", "  Quantum computing architectures are on the verge of scalability, a key\nrequirement for the implementation of a universal quantum computer. The next\nstage in this quest is the realization of quantum error correction codes, which\nwill mitigate the impact of faulty quantum information on a quantum computer.\nArchitectures with ten or more quantum bits (qubits) have been realized using\ntrapped ions and superconducting circuits. While these implementations are\npotentially scalable, true scalability will require systems engineering to\ncombine quantum and classical hardware. One technology demanding imminent\nefforts is the realization of a suitable wiring method for the control and\nmeasurement of a large number of qubits. In this work, we introduce an\ninterconnect solution for solid-state qubits: The quantum socket. The quantum\nsocket fully exploits the third dimension to connect classical electronics to\nqubits with higher density and better performance than two-dimensional methods\nbased on wire bonding. The quantum socket is based on spring-mounted micro\nwires the three-dimensional wires that push directly on a micro-fabricated\nchip, making electrical contact. A small wire cross section (~1 mmm), nearly\nnon-magnetic components, and functionality at low temperatures make the quantum\nsocket ideal to operate solid-state qubits. The wires have a coaxial geometry\nand operate over a frequency range from DC to 8 GHz, with a contact resistance\nof ~150 mohm, an impedance mismatch of ~10 ohm, and minimal crosstalk. As a\nproof of principle, we fabricated and used a quantum socket to measure\nsuperconducting resonators at a temperature of ~10 mK.\n", "  We perform Ramsey interferometry on an ultracold 87Rb ensemble confined in an\noptical dipoletrap. We use a \\pi-pulse set at the middle of the interferometer\nto restore the coherence of the spinensemble by canceling out phase\ninhomogeneities and creating a spin echo in the contrast. However,for high\natomic densities, we observe the opposite behavior: the \\pi-pulse accelerates\nthe dephasingof the spin ensemble leading to a faster contrast decay of the\ninterferometer. We understand thisphenomenon as a competition between the\nspin-echo technique and an exchange-interaction drivenspin self-rephasing\nmechanism based on the identical spin rotation effect. Our experimental data\niswell reproduced by a numerical model.\n", "  Experiments searching for exotic spin-dependent interactions typically employ\nmagnetic shielding between the source of the exotic field and the interrogated\nspins. We explore the question of what effect magnetic shielding has on\ndetectable signals induced by exotic fields. Our general conclusion is that for\ncommon experimental geometries and conditions, magnetic shields should not\nsignificantly reduce sensitivity to exotic spin-dependent interactions,\nespecially when the technique of comagnetometry is used. However, exotic fields\nthat couple to electron spin can induce magnetic fields in the interior of\nshields made of a soft ferro- or ferrimagnetic material. This induced magnetic\nfield must be taken into account in the interpretation of experiments searching\nfor new spin-dependent interactions and raises the possibility of using a flux\nconcentrator inside magnetic shields to amplify exotic spin-dependent signals.\n", "  We report the discovery by the HATSouth network of HATS-18 b: a 1.980 +/-\n0.077 Mj, 1.337 +0.102 -0.049 Rj planet in a 0.8378 day orbit, around a solar\nanalog star (mass 1.037 +/- 0.047 Msun, and radius 1.020 +0.057 -0.031 Rsun)\nwith V=14.067 +/- 0.040 mag. The high planet mass, combined with its short\norbital period, implies strong tidal coupling between the planetary orbit and\nthe star. In fact, given its inferred age, HATS-18 shows evidence of\nsignificant tidal spin up, which together with WASP-19 (a very similar system)\nallows us to constrain the tidal quality factor for Sun-like stars to be in the\nrange 6.5 <= lg(Q*/k_2) <= 7 even after allowing for extremely pessimistic\nmodel uncertainties. In addition, the HATS-18 system is among the best systems\n(and often the best system) for testing a multitude of star--planet\ninteractions, be they gravitational, magnetic or radiative, as well as planet\nformation and migration theories.\n", "  This paper presents updated estimates of source parameters for GW150914, a\nbinary black-hole coalescence event detected by the Laser Interferometer\nGravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) on September 14, 2015 [1]. Reference\npresented parameter estimation [2] of the source using a 13-dimensional,\nphenomenological precessing-spin model (precessing IMRPhenom) and a\n11-dimensional nonprecessing effective-one-body (EOB) model calibrated to\nnumerical-relativity simulations, which forces spin alignment (nonprecessing\nEOBNR). Here we present new results that include a 15-dimensional\nprecessing-spin waveform model (precessing EOBNR) developed within the EOB\nformalism. We find good agreement with the parameters estimated previously [2],\nand we quote updated component masses of $35^{+5}_{-3}\\mathrm{M}_\\odot$ and\n$30^{+3}_{-4}\\mathrm{M}_\\odot$ (where errors correspond to 90% symmetric\ncredible intervals). We also present slightly tighter constraints on the\ndimensionless spin magnitudes of the two black holes, with a primary spin\nestimate $0.65$ and a secondary spin estimate $0.75$ at 90% probability.\nReference [2] estimated the systematic parameter-extraction errors due to\nwaveform-model uncertainty by combining the posterior probability densities of\nprecessing IMRPhenom and nonprecessing EOBNR. Here we find that the two\nprecessing-spin models are in closer agreement, suggesting that these\nsystematic errors are smaller than previously quoted.\n", "  The distribution of smaller satellite galaxies around large central galaxies\nhas attracted attention because peculiar spatial and kinematic configurations\nhave been detected in some systems. A particularly striking example of such\nbehavior is seen in the satellite system of the Andromeda galaxy, where around\n80\\% are on the nearside of that galaxy, facing the Milky Way. Motivated by\nthis departure from anisotropy, we examined the spatial distribution of\nsatellites around pairs of galaxies in the SDSS. By stacking tens of thousands\nof satellites around galaxy pairs we found that satellites tend to bulge\ntowards the other central galaxy, preferably occupying the space between the\npair, rather than being spherically or axis-symmetrically distributed around\neach host. The bulging is a function of the opening angle examined and is\nfairly strong -- there are up to $\\sim$10\\% more satellites in the space\nbetween the pair, than expected from uniform. Consequently, it is a\nstatistically very strong signal, being inconsistent with a uniform\ndistribution at the 5$\\sigma$ level. The possibility that the observed signal\nis the result of the overlap of two haloes with extended satellite\ndistributions, is ruled out by testing this hypothesis by performing the same\ntests on isolated galaxies (and their satellites) artificially placed at\nsimilar separations. These findings highlight the unrelaxed and interacting\nnature of galaxies in pairs.\n", "  The direct gap interband transitions in transition metal dichalcogenides\nmonolayers are governed by chiral optical selection rules. Determined by laser\nhelicity, optical transitions in either the $K^+$ or $K^-$ valley in momentum\nspace are induced. Linearly polarized laser excitation prepares a coherent\nsuperposition of valley states. Here we demonstrate the control of the exciton\nvalley coherence in monolayer WSe2 by tuning the applied magnetic field\nperpendicular to the monolayer plane. We show rotation of this coherent\nsuperposition of valley states by angles as large as 30 degrees in applied\nfields up to 9 T. This exciton valley coherence control on ps time scale could\nbe an important step towards complete control of qubits based on the valley\ndegree of freedom.\n", "  We measure a transverse momentum kick in a Sagnac interferometer using\nweak-value amplification with two postselections. The first postselection is\ncontrolled by a polarization dependent phase mismatch between both paths of a\nSagnac interferometer and the second postselection is controlled by a polarizer\nat the exit port. By monitoring the darkport of the interferometer, we study\nthe complementary amplification of the concatenated postselections, where the\npolarization extinction ratio is greater than the contrast of the spatial\ninterference. In this case, we find an improvement in the amplification of the\nsignal of interest by introducing a second postselection to the system.\n", "  We investigate the dynamics of a strongly-driven, microwave-dressed,\ndonor-bound electron spin qubit in silicon. A resonant oscillating magnetic\nfield $B_1$ is used to dress the electron spin and create a new quantum system\nwith a level splitting proportional to $B_1$. The dressed two-level system can\nthen be driven by modulating the detuning $\\Delta\\nu$ between the microwave\nsource frequency $\\nu_{\\rm MW}$ and the electron spin transition frequency\n$\\nu_e$ at the frequency of the level splitting. The resulting dressed qubit\nRabi frequency $\\Omega_{R\\rho}$ is defined by the modulation amplitude, which\ncan be made comparable to the level splitting using frequency modulation on the\nmicrowave source. This allows us to investigate the regime where the rotating\nwave approximation breaks down, without requiring microwave power levels that\nwould be incompatible with a cryogenic environment. We observe clear deviations\nfrom normal Rabi oscillations and can numerically simulate the time evolution\nof the states in excellent agreement with the experimental data.\n", "  Dark Matter (DM) may have a relic density that is in part determined by a\nparticle/antiparticle asymmetry, much like baryons. If this is the case, it can\naccumulate in stars like the Sun to sizable number densities and annihilate to\nStandard Model (SM) particles including neutrinos. We show that the combination\nof neutrino telescope and direct detection data can be used in conjunction to\ndetermine or constrain the DM asymmetry from data. Depending on the DM mass,\nthe current neutrino data from Super-K and IceCube give powerful constraints on\nasymmetric DM unless its fractional asymmetry is $\\lesssim 10^{-2}$. Future\nneutrino telescopes and detectors like Hyper-K and KM3NeT can search for the\nresulting signal of high-energy neutrinos from the center of the Sun. The\nobservation of such a flux yields information on both the DM-nucleus cross\nsection but also on the relative abundances of DM and anti-DM.\n", "  Depopulation of the Mn$^{2+}$ state in ZnO:Mn upon illumination, monitored by\nquenching of the Mn$^{2+}$ EPR signal intensity, was observed at temperatures\nbelow 80~K. Mn$^{2+}$ photoquenching is shown to result from the Mn$^{2+}$\n$\\to$ Mn$^{3+}$ ionization transition, promoting one electron to the conduction\nband. Temperature dependence of this process indicates the existence of an\nenergy barrier for electron recapture of the order of 1~meV. GGA$+U$\ncalculations show that after ionization of Mn$^{2+}$ a moderate breathing\nlattice relaxation in the 3+ charge state occurs, which increases energies of\n$d$(Mn) levels. At its equilibrium atomic configuration, Mn$^{3+}$ is\nmetastable since the direct capture of photo-electron is not possible. The\nmetastability is mainly driven by the strong intra-shell Coulomb repulsion\nbetween $d$(Mn) electrons. Both the estimated barrier for electron capture and\nthe photoionization energy are in good agreement with the experimental values.\n", "  MoTe2 belongs to the semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenide family\nwith some properties differing from the other well-studied members\n(Mo,W)(S,Se)2. The optical band gap is in the near infrared region and both\nmonolayers and bilayers may have a direct optical band gap. We first simulate\nthe band structure of both monolayer and bilayer MoTe2 with DFT-GW\ncalculations. We find a direct (indirect) electronic band gap for the monolayer\n(bilayer). By solving the Bethe-Salpeter equation, we calculate similar\nenergies for the direct excitonic states in monolayer and bilayer. We then\nstudy the optical properties by means of photoluminescence (PL) excitation,\ntime-resolved PL and power dependent PL spectroscopy. We identify the same\nenergy for the B exciton state in monolayer and bilayer. Following circularly\npolarized excitation, we do not find any exciton polarization for a large range\nof excitation energies. At low temperature (T=10 K), we measure similar PL\ndecay times of the order of 4 ps for both monolayer and bilayer excitons with a\nslightly longer one for the bilayer. Finally, we observe a reduction of the\nexciton-exciton annihilation contribution to the non-radiative recombination in\nbilayer.\n", "  Using Matrix Product Operators (MPO) the Schwinger model is simulated in\nthermal equilibrium. The variational manifold of gauge invariant MPO is\nconstructed to represent Gibbs states. As a first application the chiral\ncondensate in thermal equilibrium is computed and agreement with earlier\nstudies is found. Furthermore, as a new application the Schwinger model is\nprobed with a fractional charged static quark-antiquark pair separated\ninfinitely far from each other. A critical temperature beyond which the string\ntension is exponentially suppressed is found, which is in qualitative agreement\nwith analytical studies in the strong coupling limit. Finally, the CT symmetry\nbreaking is investigated and our results strongly suggest that the symmetry is\nrestored at any nonzero temperature.\n", "  The conversion of the IR emission into star formation rate can be strongly\ndependent on the physical properties of the dust, which are affected by the\nenvironmental conditions where the dust is embedded. We study here the dust\nproperties of a set of HII regions in the Local Group Galaxy M33 presenting\ndifferent spatial configurations between the stars, gas and dust to understand\nthe dust evolution under different environments. We model the SED of each\nregion using the DustEM tool and obtain the mass relative to hydrogen for Very\nSmall Grains (YVSG), Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (YPAH) and Big Grains\n(YBG). The relative mass of the VSGs (YVSG/YTOT) is a factor of 1.7 higher for\nHII regions classified as filled and mixed than for regions presenting a shell\nstructure. The enhancement of VSGs within NGC 604 and NGC 595 is correlated to\nexpansive gas structures with velocities greater than 50 km/s. The gas-to-dust\nratio derived for the HII regions in our sample exhibits two regimes related to\nthe HI-H2 transition of the ISM. Regions corresponding to the HI diffuse regime\npresent a gas-to-dust ratio compatible with the expected value if we assume\nthat the gas-to-dust ratio scales linearly with metallicity, while regions\ncorresponding to a H2 molecular phase present a flatter dust-gas surface\ndensity distribution. The fraction of VSGs can be affected by the conditions of\nthe interstellar environment: strong shocks of 50-90 km/s existing in the\ninterior of the most luminous HII regions can lead to fragmentation of BGs into\nsmaller ones, while the more evolved shell and clear shell objects provide a\nmore quiescent environment where reformation of dust BG grains might occur. The\ngas-to-dust variations found in this analysis might imply that grain\ncoagulation and/or gas-phase metals incorporation to the dust mass is occurring\nin the interior of the HII regions in M33.\n", "  Pyrochlore oxides show several fascinating phenomena, such as the formation\nof heavy fermions and the thermal Hall effect. Although a key to understanding\nsome phenomena may be the Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya (DM) interaction, its\nmicroscopic origin is unclear. To clarify the microscopic origin, we\nconstructed a $t_{2g}$-orbital model with the kinetic energy, the\ntrigonal-distortion potential, the multiorbital Hubbard interactions, and the\n$LS$ coupling, and derived the low-energy effective Hamiltonian for a $d^{1}$\nMott insulator with the weak $LS$ coupling. We first show that lack of the\ninversion center of each nearest-neighbor V-V bond causes the odd-mirror\ninterorbital hopping integrals. Those are qualitatively different from the\neven-mirror hopping integrals, existing even with the inversion center. We next\nshow that the second-order perturbation using the kinetic terms leads to the\nferromagnetic and the antiferromagnetic super exchange interactions. Then, we\nshow the most important result: the third-order perturbation terms using the\ncombination of the even-mirror hopping integral, the odd-mirror hopping\nintegral, and the $LS$ coupling causes the DM interaction due to the\nmirror-mixing effect, where those hopping integrals are necessary to obtain the\nantisymmetric kinetic exchange and the $LS$ coupling is necessary to excite the\norbital angular momentum at one of two sites. We also show that the magnitude\nand sign of the DM interaction can be controlled by changing the positions of\nthe O ions and the strength of the Hubbard interactions. We discuss the\nadvantages in comparison with the phenomenological theory and Moriya's\nmicroscopic theory, applicability of our mechanism, and the similarities and\ndifferences between our case and the strong-$LS$-coupling case.\n", "  We have developed a fine-pitch hard X-ray (HXR) detector using a cadmium\ntelluride (CdTe) semiconductor for imaging and spectroscopy for the second\nlaunch of the Focusing Optics Solar X-ray Imager (FOXSI). FOXSI is a rocket\nexperiment to perform high sensitivity HXR observations from 4-15 keV using the\nnew technique of HXR focusing optics. The focal plane detector requires < 100\num position resolution (to take advantage of the angular resolution of the\noptics) and about 1 keV energy resolution (FWHM) for spectroscopy down to 4\nkeV, with moderate cooling (> -30 C). Double-sided silicon strip detectors were\nused for the first FOXSI flight in 2012 to meet these criteria. To improve the\ndetectors' efficiency (66 at 15 keV for the silicon detectors) and position\nresolution of 75 um for the second launch, we fabricated double-sided CdTe\nstrip detectors with a position resolution of 60 um and almost 100 % efficiency\nfor the FOXSI energy range. The sensitive area is 7.67 mm x 7.67 mm,\ncorresponding to the field of view of 791'' x 791''. An energy resolution of\nabout 1 keV (FWHM) and low energy threshold of 4 keV were achieved in\nlaboratory calibrations. The second launch of FOXSI was performed on December\n11, 2014, and images from the Sun were successfully obtained with the CdTe\ndetector. Therefore we successfully demonstrated the detector concept and the\nusefulness of this technique for future HXR observations of the Sun.\n", "  We propose a mechanism for realization of exact control of parity-time (PT)\nsymmetry by using a periodically modulated nonlinear optical coupler with\nbalanced gain and loss. It is shown that for certain appropriately chosen\nvalues of the modulation parameters, we can construct a family of exact\nanalytical solutions for the two-mode equations describing the dynamics of such\nnonlinear couplers. These exact solutions give explicit examples that allow us\nto precisely manipulate the system from nonlinearity-induced symmetry breaking\nto PT symmetry, thus providing an analytical approach to the all-optical signal\ncontrol in nonlinear PT-symmetric structures.\n", "  We study the statistics of the fluorescence decay rates for single quantum\nemitters embedded in a scattering medium undergoing a phase transition. Under\ncertain circumstances, the structural properties of the scattering medium\nexplore a regime in which the system dynamically switches between two different\nphases. While in that regime the light scattering properties of both phases are\nhardly distinguishable, we demonstrate that the lifetime statistics of single\nemitters with low diffusivity is clearly dependent on the dynamical state in\nwhich the medium evolves. Hence, lifetime statistics provides clear signatures\nof phase switching in systems where light scattering does not.\n", "  In this work we present an analysis of the behaviour of galaxies in a\nfour-dimensional parameter space defined by stellar mass, metallicity, star\nformation rate, and molecular gas mass. We analyse a combined sample of 227\ngalaxies, which draws from a number of surveys across the redshift range 0 < z\n< 2 (> 90% of the sample at z~0), and covers > 3 decades in stellar mass.Using\nPrinciple Component Analysis, we demonstrate that galaxies in our sample lie on\na 2-dimensional plane within this 4D parameter space, indicative of galaxies\nthat exist in an equilibrium between gas inflow and outflow. Furthermore, we\nfind that the metallicity of galaxies depends only on stellar mass and\nmolecular gas mass. In other words, gas-phase metallicity has a negligible\ndependence on star formation rate, once the correlated effect of molecular gas\ncontent is accounted for. The well-known `fundamental metallicity relation',\nwhich describes a close and tight relationship between metallicity and SFR (at\nfixed stellar mass) is therefore entirely a by-product of the underlying\nphysical relationship with molecular gas mass (via the Schmidt-Kennicutt\nrelation).\n", "  We consider Earth satellite orbits in the range of semi-major axes where the\nperturbing effects of Earth's oblateness and lunisolar gravity are of\ncomparable order. This range covers the medium-Earth orbits (MEO) of the Global\nNavigation Satellite Systems and the geosynchronous orbits (GEO) of the\ncommunication satellites. We recall a secular and quadrupolar model, based on\nthe Milankovitch vector formulation of perturbation theory, which governs the\nlong-term orbital evolution subject to the predominant gravitational\ninteractions. We study the global dynamics of this two-and-a-half\ndegrees-of-freedom Hamiltonian system by means of the fast Lyapunov indicator\n(FLI), used in a statistical sense. Specifically, we characterize the degree of\nchaoticity of the action space using angle-averaged normalized FLI maps,\nthereby overcoming the angle dependencies of the conventional stability maps.\nEmphasis is placed upon the phase-space structures near secular resonances,\nwhich are of first importance to the space debris community. We confirm and\nquantify the transition from order to chaos in MEO, stemming from the critical\ninclinations, and find that highly inclined GEO orbits are particularly\nunstable. Despite their reputed normality, Earth satellite orbits can possess\nan extraordinarily rich spectrum of dynamical behaviors, and, from a\nmathematical perspective, have all the complications that make them very\ninteresting candidates for testing the modern tools of chaos theory.\n", "  We show using simple arguments, that the conceptual triad of a {\\it\nclassical} black hole, semi-classical Hawking emission and geometry\nquantization is inherently, mutually incompatible. Presence of any two\nexplicitly violates the third. We argue that geometry quantization, if realized\nin nature, magnifies the quantum gravity features hugely to catapult them into\nthe realm of observational possibilities. We also explore a quantum route\ntowards extremality of the black holes.\n", "  In the absence of a third dredge-up episode during the asymptotic giant\nbranch phase, white dwarf models evolved from low-metallicity progenitors have\na thick hydrogen envelope, which makes hydrogen shell burning be the most\nimportant energy source. We investigate the pulsational stability of white\ndwarf models with thick envelopes to see whether nonradial $g$-mode pulsations\nare triggered by hydrogen burning, with the aim of placing constraints on\nhydrogen shell burning in cool white dwarfs and on a third dredge-up during the\nasymptotic giant branch evolution of their progenitor stars. We construct\nwhite-dwarf sequences from low-metallicity progenitors by means of full\nevolutionary calculations, and analyze their pulsation stability for the models\nin the range of effective temperatures $T_{\\rm eff} \\sim 15\\,000\\,-\\, 8\\,000$\nK. We demonstrate that, for white dwarf models with masses $M_{\\star} \\lesssim\n0.71\\,\\rm M_{\\sun}$ and effective temperatures $8\\,500 \\lesssim T_{\\rm eff}\n\\lesssim 11\\,600$ K that evolved from low-metallicity progenitors ($Z= 0.0001$,\n$0.0005$, and $0.001$) the dipole ($\\ell= 1$) and quadrupole ($\\ell=2$) $g_1$\nmodes are excited mostly due to the hydrogen-burning shell through the\n$\\varepsilon$-mechanism, in addition to other $g$ modes driven by either the\n$\\kappa-\\gamma$ or the convective driving mechanism. However, the $\\varepsilon$\nmechanism is insufficient to drive these modes in white dwarfs evolved from\nsolar-metallicity progenitors. We suggest that efforts should be made to\nobserve the dipole $g_1$ mode in white dwarfs associated with low-metallicity\nenvironments, such as globular clusters and/or the galactic halo, to place\nconstraints on hydrogen shell burning in cool white dwarfs and the third\ndredge-up episode during the preceding asymptotic giant branch phase.\n", "  Aims. We have investigated neutral gas in the central cavity of the\ncircumnuclear disk (CND) at the Galactic Center, where the ionized minispiral\nlies, to describe the H2 distribution and properties in this ionized\nenvironment. Methods. This study was carried out through a spectro-imaging data\ncube of the central cavity obtained with SPIFFI on the VLT. The observed field\nof view is 36\"x 29\" , with a spectral resolution R = 1 300 in the\nnear-infrared. These observations cover several H2 lines. To preserve the\nspatial resolution and avoid edge effects, we applied a new line-fitting method\nthat consists of a regularized 3D fitting. We also applied a more classical 1D\nfitting to compare the relative strength of the H2 lines. Results. We present\nhigh spatial and spectral resolution maps of the intensity, velocity, and width\nof five H2 lines and an extinction map derived from H2. Molecular gas is\ndetected everywhere in the field. In particular, in addition to the known CND\nfeatures, we detected an emission from the northern arm cloud and from the\nminicavity. The excitation diagrams allow us to estimate the temperature, mass,\nand density of these features. Conclusions. We interpret the CND emission as\ncoming from a hot, thermalized, thin layer at the surface of the clouds. The\nobserved H2 corresponds only to a small fraction of the total H2 mass. The\nemission remains fairly strong in the whole central cavity, but it is not\nthermalized. A strong deviation from thermal equilibrium is detected near the\nminicavity. We suggest that this emission is caused by constantly forming H2\nthat is destroyed again before it reaches ortho/para equilibrium.\n", "  We investigate the heavier electroweakino sectors in several versions of the\nMSSM, which has not been explored so far in the light of the LHC data, and\nobtain new bounds using the ATLAS Run I constraints in the $3l +\n{E\\!\\!\\!\\!/_T}$ channel. We also venture beyond the trilepton events and\npredict several novel multilepton + ${E\\!\\!\\!\\!/_T}$ signatures of these\nelectroweakinos which may show up before the next shutdown of the LHC.\n", "  Ever since Schrodinger, Time in quantum theory is postulated Newtonian for\nevery reference frame. With the help of certain known mathematical results, we\nshow that the concept of the so-called Local Time allows avoiding the\npostulate. In effect, time appears as neither fundamental nor universal on the\nquantum-mechanical level while being consistently attributable to every, at\nleast approximately, closed quantum system as well as to every of its\n(conservative or not) subsystems.\n", "  It is well known that, in single clock inflation, the curvature perturbation\n$\\zeta$ is constant in time on superhorizon scales. In the standard bulk\ndescription this follows quite simply from the local conservation of the energy\nmomentum tensor in the bulk. On the other hand, in a holographic description,\nthe constancy of the curvature perturbation must be related to the properties\nof the RG flow in the boundary theory. Here, we show that, in single clock\nholographic inflation, the time independence of correlators of $\\zeta$ follows\nfrom the cut-off independence of correlators of the energy momentum tensor in\nthe boundary theory, and from the so-called consistency relations for vertex\nfunctions with a soft leg.\n", "  We report low temperature muon spin relaxation (muSR) measurements of the\nhigh-transition-temperature (Tc) cuprate superconductors\nBi{2+x}Sr{2-x}CaCu2O{8+\\delta} and YBa2Cu3O6.57, aimed at detecting the\nmysterious intra-unit cell (IUC) magnetic order that has been observed by spin\npolarized neutron scattering in the pseudogap phase of four different cuprate\nfamilies. A lack of confirmation by local magnetic probe methods has raised the\npossibility that the magnetic order fluctuates slowly enough to appear static\non the time scale of neutron scattering, but too fast to affect $\\mu$SR or\nnuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) signals. The IUC magnetic order has been\nlinked to a theoretical model for the cuprates, which predicts a long-range\nordered phase of electron-current loop order that terminates at a quantum\ncrictical point (QCP). Our study suggests that lowering the temperature to T ~\n25 mK and moving far below the purported QCP does not cause enough of a slowing\ndown of fluctuations for the IUC magnetic order to become detectable on the\ntime scale of muSR. Our measurements place narrow limits on the fluctuation\nrate of this unidentified magnetic order.\n", "  A large number of extremely low-mass helium white dwarfs (ELM WDs) have been\ndiscovered in recent years. The majority of them are found in close binary\nsystems suggesting they are formed either through a common-envelope phase or\nvia stable mass transfer in a low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) or a cataclysmic\nvariable (CV) system. Here, we investigate the formation of these objects\nthrough the LMXB channel with emphasis on the proto-WD evolution in\nenvironments with different metallicities. We study, for the first time, the\ncombined effects of rotational mixing and element diffusion (e.g. gravitational\nsettling, thermal and chemical diffusion) on the evolution of proto-WDs and on\nthe cooling properties of the resulting WDs. We present state-of-the-art binary\nstellar evolution models computed with MESA for metallicities between Z=0.0002\nand Z=0.02, producing WDs with masses between 0.16-0.45 M$_{\\odot}$. Our\nresults confirm that element diffusion plays a significant role in the\nevolution of proto-WDs that experience hydrogen shell flashes. The occurrence\nof these flashes produces a clear dichotomy in the cooling timescales of ELM\nWDs, which has important consequences e.g. for the age determination of binary\nmillisecond pulsars. Rotational mixing is found to counteract the effect of\ngravitational settling in the surface layers of young, bloated ELM proto-WDs\nand therefore plays a key role in determining their surface chemical\nabundances. We predict that these proto-WDs have helium-rich envelopes through\na significant part of their lifetime, a crucial ingredient for understanding\nthe newly observed ELM proto-WD pulsators. The hydrogen envelope at detachment,\nalthough small compared to the total mass of the WD, contains enough angular\nmomentum such that the spin frequency of the resulting WD on the cooling track\nis well above the orbital frequency.\n", "  Aims. Polarimetric characteristics of comets at large heliocentric distances\nis a relatively unexplored area; we extend the idea by adding and analysing the\ndata for three Jupiter family comets (JFCs).\n  Methods. With the FORS2 instrument of the ESO VLT, we performed\nquasi-simultaneous photometry and polarimetry of three active JFCs\n67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, 74P/Smirnova-Chernykh, and 152P/Helin-Lawrence.\n  Results. We obtained in total 23 polarimetric measurements at different\nepochs, covering a phase-angle range ~1 -16 degrees and heliocentric distances\nfrom 3 to 4.6 au. From our observations we obtained both colour and\npolarimetric maps to look for structures in the comae and tails of the comets.\n  Conclusions. 74P/Smirnova-Chernykh and 152P/Helin-Lawrence exhibit enough\nactivity at large heliocentric distances to be detectable in polarimetric\nmeasurements. Polarimetric and colour maps indicate no evidence of dust\nparticle\n", "  In this work corrections to the usual flavor SU(2) Nambu-Jona-Lasinio\ncoupling due to a weak external magnetic field are calculated by considering\nquark polarization in a (dressed) gluon exchange mechanism for quark\ninteractions. The quark field is splitted into two components, one that\ncondenses and another one that is a background field for interacting quarks,\nbeing the former integrated out. The resulting determinant is expanded for\nrelatively large quark mass and small magnetic field, $(eB_0/{M^*}^2)<1$ by\nresolving magnetic field dependent low energy quark effective interactions.\nBesides the corrections for the NJL and vector NJL effective couplings,\ndifferent $B_0-$dependent effective couplings that break isospin and chiral\nsymmetry emerge.\n", "  Motivated by uncertainty quantification in natural transport systems, we\ninvestigate an individual-based transport process involving particles\nundergoing a random walk along a line of point sinks whose strengths are\nthemselves independent random variables. We assume particles are removed from\nthe system via first-order kinetics. We analyse the system using a hierarchy of\napproaches when the sinks are sparsely distributed, including a stochastic\nhomogenization approximation that yields explicit predictions for the extrinsic\ndisorder in the stationary state due to sink strength fluctuations. The\nextrinsic noise induces long-range spatial correlations in the particle\nconcentration, unlike fluctuations due to the intrinsic noise alone.\nAdditionally, the mean concentration profile, averaged over both intrinsic and\nextrinsic noise, is elevated compared with the corresponding profile from a\nuniform sink distribution, showing that the classical homogenization\napproximation can be a biased estimator of the true mean.\n", "  Context. Galaxy clusters are continuously growing through the accretion of\nmatter in their outskirts. This process induces inhomogeneities in the gas\ndensity distribution (clumping) which need to be taken into account to recover\nthe physical properties of the intracluster medium (ICM) at large radii. Aims.\nWe studied the thermodynamic properties in the outskirts (R > R500) of the\nmassive galaxy cluster Abell 2142 by combining the Sunyaev Zel'dovich (SZ)\neffect with the X-ray signal. Methods. We combined the SZ pressure profile\nmeasured by Planck with the XMM-Newton gas density profile to recover radial\nprofiles of temperature, entropy and hydrostatic mass out to 2R500. We used a\nmethod that is insensitive to clumping to recover the gas density, and we\ncompared the results with traditional X-ray measurement techniques. Results.\nWhen taking clumping into account, our joint SZ/X-ray entropy profile is\nconsistent with the predictions from pure gravitational collapse, whereas a\nsignificant entropy flattening is found when the effect of clumping is\nneglected. The hydrostatic mass profile recovered using joint X-ray/SZ data\nagrees with that obtained from spectroscopic X-ray measurements and with mass\nreconstructions obtained through weak lensing and galaxy kinematics.\nConclusions. We found that clumping can explain the entropy flattening observed\nby Suzaku in the outskirts of several clusters. When using a method insensitive\nto clumping for the reconstruction of the gas density, the thermodynamic\nproperties of Abell 2142 are compatible with the assumption that the thermal\ngas pressure sustains gravity and that the entropy is injected at accretion\nshocks, with no need to evoke more exotic physics. Our results highlight the\nneed for X-ray observations with sufficient spatial resolution, and large\ncollecting area, to understand the processes at work in cluster outer regions.\n", "  Red giant stars are perhaps the most important type of stars for Galactic and\nextra-galactic archaeology: they are luminous, occur in all stellar\npopulations, and their surface temperatures allow precise abundance\ndeterminations for many different chemical elements. Yet, the full star\nformation and enrichment history of a galaxy can be traced directly only if two\nkey observables can be determined for large stellar samples - age and chemical\ncomposition. While spectroscopy is a powerful method to analyse the detailed\nabundances of stars, stellar ages are the \"missing link in the chain\", since\nthey are not a direct observable. However, spectroscopy should be able to\nestimate stellar masses, which for red giants directly infer ages provided\ntheir chemical composition is known.\n  Here we establish a new empirical relation between the shape of the hydrogen\nline in the observed spectra of red giants and stellar mass determined from\nasteroseismology. The relation allows to determine stellar masses and ages with\nthe accuracy of 10-15%. The method can be used with confidence for stars in the\nfollowing range of stellar parameters: 4000 < Teff < 5000 K, 0.5 < log g < 3.5,\n-2.0 < [Fe/H] < 0.3, and luminosities log L/LSun < 2.5. Our analysis provides\nobservational evidence that the Halpha spectral characteristics of red giant\nstars are tightly correlated with their mass and therefore their age. We also\nshow that the method samples well all stellar populations with ages above 1\nGyr. Targeting bright giants, the method allows to obtain simultaneous age and\nchemical abundance information far deeper than would be possible with\nasteroseismology, extending the possible survey volume to remote regions of the\nMilky Way and even to neighbouring galaxies like Andromeda or the Magellanic\nClouds already with present instrumentation, like VLT and Keck facilities.\n", "  We study parton distributions for two partons, a quark and a gluon, in the\nlight-front dressed quark model, with focus on correlations between the two\npartons. The model calculation leads to sizable spin-spin and spin-kinematic\ncorrelations of interest for studies of double parton scattering (DPS) in\nhigh-energy collisions. In particular, we find that the transverse dependence\nof the double parton distributions (DPDs) does not factorize within the model.\nThe results gives insight to the strengths of correlations in different\nkinematical regions, which can help in constructing input DPDs in cross section\ncalculations.\n", "  Measurements of velocity and density perturbations along stellar streams in\nthe Milky Way provide a time integrated measure of dark matter substructure at\nlarger galactic radius than the complementary instantaneous inner halo strong\nlensing detections of dark matter sub-halos in distant galaxies. An interesting\ncase to consider is the proposed Phoenix-Hermus star stream, which is long,\nthin and on a nearly circular orbit, making it a particular good target to\nstudy for velocity variations along its length. In the presence of dark matter\nsub-halos the distribution of velocities is significantly perturbed in a manner\nthat is readily understood with the impulse approximation. A set of simulations\nshow that only sub-halos above a few 10^7 M_sun lead to reasonably long lived\nobservationally detectable velocity variations of amplitude of order 1 kms,\nwith an average of about one visible hit per (two-armed) stream. An implication\nis that globular clusters themselves will not have a visible impact on the\nstream. Radial velocities have the benefit that they are completely insensitive\nto distance errors. Distance errors scatter individual star velocities\nperpendicular and tangential to the mean orbit but their mean values remain\nunbiased. Calculations like these help build the quantitative case to acquire\nlarge, fairly deep, velocity samples of stream stars.\n", "  We introduce a new technique for dealing with the matrix elements of the\nHamiltonian operator in loop quantum gravity, based on the use of intertwiners\nprojected on coherent states of angular momentum. We give explicit expressions\nfor the projections of intertwiners on the spin coherent states in terms of\ncomplex numbers describing the unit vectors which label the coherent states.\nOperators such as the Hamiltonian can then be reformulated as differential\noperators acting on polynomials of these complex numbers. This makes it\npossible to describe the action of the Hamiltonian geometrically, in terms of\nthe unit vectors originating from the angular momentum coherent states, and\nopens up a way towards investigating the semiclassical limit of the dynamics\nvia asymptotic approximation methods.\n", "  We present a narrowband survey with three adjacent filters for z=2.8--2.9\nLyman Alpha Emitter (LAE) galaxies in the Extended Chandra Deep Field South\n(ECDFS), along with spectroscopic followup. With a complete sample of 96 LAEs\nin the narrowband NB466, we confirm a large-scale structure at z~ 2.8. Compared\nto the blank field in NB470 and NB475, the LAE density excess in the NB466\nfield is ~6.0+/-0.8 times the standard deviation expected at z~2.8, assuming a\nlinear bias of 2. The overdense large scale structure in NB466 can be\ndecomposed into 4 protoclusters, whose overdensities are 4.6 - 6.6. These 4\nprotoclusters are expected to evolve into a Coma-like cluster at z~ 0. In the\nmeanwhile, we investigate the average star-formation rates derived from\nLy{\\alpha}, rest-frame UV and X-ray, the Ly{\\alpha} luminosity functions, the\nLy{\\alpha} photon densities and their dependence on the environment. We find\nthat the Ly{\\alpha} photon density in the overdense field (NB466) is ~50\\%\nhigher than that in the blank field (NB470+NB475). The 3 brightest LAEs,\nincluding a quasar at z=2.81, are all detected in X-ray and in NB466. These\nthree LAE-AGNs contribute an extra 20--30\\% Ly{\\alpha} photon density.\nFurthermore, we find that LAEs in overdense regions are younger and less dusty.\nWe conclude that the structure we found is a significant and rare density peak,\nand narrowband imaging is an efficient method to detect and study such\nstructures in the high-z universe.\n", "  We consider continuous quantum measurement of a superconducting qubit in the\ncircuit QED setup with a moderate bandwidth of the measurement resonator, i.e.,\nwhen the \"bad cavity\" limit is not applicable. The goal is a simple description\nof the quantum evolution due to measurement, i.e., the measurement back-action.\nExtending the quantum Bayesian approach previously developed for the \"bad\ncavity\" regime, we show that the evolution equations remain the same, but now\nthey should be applied to the entangled qubit-resonator state, instead of the\nqubit state alone. The derivation uses only elementary quantum mechanics and\nbasic properties of coherent states, thus being accessible to non-experts.\n", "  In the setup of isolated quantum systems, it is proved that the thermodynamic\nentropy and the diagonal entropy must increase extensively in any nontrivial\nquantum quench. The extensive increase of the thermodynamic entropy is shown\nfor any initial state (even for a pure state) that represents thermal\nequilibrium. On the other hand, the extensive increase of the diagonal entropy\nis shown for any stationary initial state under the condition that both the\npre-quench and the post-quench Hamiltonians satisfy the eigenstate\nthermalization hypothesis.\n", "  Self-rotation occurs in an exciton-polariton condensate in a two-dimensional\nsemiconductor microcavity pumped by a nonresonant Gaussian laser beam. A wave\npacket of the condensate spontaneously rotates around the center of the pumped\nregion at a constant frequency breaking the rotation symmetry of the system.\nWhen two self-rotating condensates are created with an appropriate distance,\nsynchronization occurs between the dynamics of the self-rotating condensates.\n", "  We present new molecular gas maps of NGC5195 (alternatively known as M51b)\nfrom the Combined Array for Research in Millimeter Astronomy (CARMA), including\n12CO(1-0), 13CO(1-0), CN(1-0), and CS(2-1). NGC5195 has also been detected in\n3mm continuum. NGC5195 has a 12CO/13CO ratio consistent with normal\nstar-forming galaxies. The CN(1-0) intensity is higher than is seen in an\naverage star-forming galaxy, possibly enhanced in the diffuse\nphoto-dissociation regions. Stellar template fitting of the nuclear spectrum of\nNGC5195 shows two stellar populations: an 80% mass fraction of old (>10Gyr) and\na 20% mass fraction of intermediate-aged (~1Gyr) stellar populations, providing\na constraint on the timescale over which NGC5195 experienced enhanced star\nformation during its interaction with M51a. The average molecular gas depletion\ntimescale in NGC5195 is: tdep=3.08Gyr, a factor of ~2 larger than the depletion\ntimescales in nearby star-forming galaxies, but consistent with the depletion\nseen in CO-detected early-type galaxies. While the radio continuum emission at\ncentimeter and millimeter wavelengths is present in the vicinity of the nucleus\nof NGC5195, we find it is most likely associated with nuclear star formation\nrather than a radio-loud AGN. Thus, despite having a substantial interaction\nwith M51a ~1/2Gyr ago, the molecular gas in NGC5195 has resettled and is\nforming stars at an efficiency consistent with settled early-type galaxies at\nthe present time.\n", "  Properties of hot dense ultrarelativistic spinor matter in a slab of finite\nwidth, placed in a transverse uniform magnetic field, are studied. The\nadmissible set of boundary conditions is determined by the requirement that\nspinor matter be confined inside the slab. In thermal equilibrium, the chiral\nseparation effect in the slab is shown to depend on both temperature and\nchemical potential; this is distinct from the unrealistic case of the magnetic\nfield filling the unbounded (infinite) medium, when the effect is temperature\nindependent. In the realistic case of the slab, a stepwise behaviour of the\naxial current density at zero temperature is smoothed out as temperature\nincreases, turning into a linear behaviour at infinitely large temperature. A\nchoice of boundary conditions can facilitate either augmentation or attenuation\nof the chiral separation effect; in particular, the effect can persist even at\nzero chemical potential, if temperature is finite. Thus the boundary condition\ncan serve as a source that is additional to the spinor matter density.\n", "  Context. The formation of planetary systems is a common, yet complex\nmechanism. Numerous stars have been identified to possess a debris disk, a\nproto-planetary disk or a planetary system. The understanding of such formation\nprocess requires the study of debris disks. These targets are substantial and\nparticularly suitable for optical and infrared observations. Sparse Aperture\nmasking (SAM) is a high angular resolution technique strongly contributing to\nprobe the region from 30 to 200 mas around the stars. This area is usually\nunreachable with classical imaging, and the technique also remains highly\ncompetitive compared to vortex coronagraphy. Aims. We aim to study debris disks\nwith aperture masking to probe the close environment of the stars. Our goal is\neither to find low mass companions, or to set detection limits. Methods. We\nobserved eight stars presenting debris disks ( $\\beta$ Pictoris, AU\nMicroscopii, 49 Ceti, $\\eta$ Telescopii, Fomalhaut, g Lupi, HD181327 and\nHR8799) with SAM technique on the NaCo instrument at the VLT. Results. No close\ncompanions were detected using closure phase information under 0.5 of\nseparation from the parent stars. We obtained magnitude detection limits that\nwe converted to Jupiter masses detection limits using theoretical isochrones\nfrom evolutionary models. Conclusions. We derived upper mass limits on the\npresence of companions in the area of few times the diffraction limit of the\ntelescope around each target star.\n", "  We present a 3 mm spectral line and continuum survey of L1451 in the Perseus\nMolecular Cloud. These observations are from the CARMA Large Area Star\nFormation Survey (CLASSy), which also imaged Barnard 1, NGC 1333, Serpens Main\nand Serpens South. L1451 is the survey region with the lowest level of star\nformation activity---it contains no confirmed protostars. HCO+, HCN, and N2H+\n(J=1-0) are all detected throughout the region, with HCO+ the most spatially\nwidespread, and molecular emission seen toward 90% of the area above N(H_2)\ncolumn densities of 1.9x10^21 cm^-2. HCO+ has the broadest velocity dispersion,\nnear 0.3 km/s on average, compared to ~0.15 km/s for the other molecules, thus\nrepresenting a range from supersonic to subsonic gas motions. Our non-binary\ndendrogram analysis reveals that the dense gas traced by each molecule has\nsimilar hierarchical structure, and that gas surrounding the candidate first\nhydrostatic core (FHSC), L1451-mm, and other previously detected single-dish\ncontinuum clumps have similar hierarchical structure; this suggests that\ndifferent sub-regions of L1451 are fragmenting on the pathway to forming young\nstars. We determined the three-dimensional morphology of the largest detectable\ndense gas structures to be relatively ellipsoidal compared to other CLASSy\nregions, which appeared more flattened at largest scales. A virial analysis\nshows the most centrally condensed dust structures are likely unstable against\ncollapse. Additionally, we identify a new spherical, centrally condensed N2H+\nfeature that could be a new FHSC candidate. The overall results suggest L1451\nis a young region starting to form its generation of stars within turbulent,\nhierarchical structures.\n", "  The rapid shape change in Zr isotopes near neutron number $N$=60 is\nidentified to be caused by type II shell evolution associated with massive\nproton excitations to its $0g_{9/2}$ orbit, and is shown to be a quantum phase\ntransition. Monte Carlo shell-model calculations are carried out for Zr\nisotopes of $N$=50-70 with many configurations spanned by eight proton orbits\nand eight neutron orbits. Energy levels and B(E2) values are obtained within a\nsingle framework in a good agreement with experiments, depicting various shapes\nin going from $N$=50 to 70. Novel coexistence of prolate and triaxial shapes is\nsuggested.\n", "  Background: Type II shell evolution has recently been identified as a\nmicroscopic cause for nuclear shape coexistence. Purpose: Establish a low-lying\nrotational band in 96-Zr. Methods: High-resolution inelastic electron\nscattering and a relative analysis of transition strengths are used. Results:\nThe B(E2; 0_1^+ -> 2_2^+) value is measured and electromagnetic decay strengths\nof the secdond 2^+ state are deduced. Conclusions: Shape coexistence is\nestablished for 96-Zr. Type II shell evolution provides a systematic and\nquantitative mechanism to understand deformation at low excitation energies.\n", "  We examine the hypothesis that the red near-infrared colors of some L dwarfs\ncould be explained by a \"dust haze\" of small particles in their upper\natmospheres. This dust haze would exist in conjunction with the clouds found in\ndwarfs with more typical colors. We developed a model which uses Mie theory and\nthe Hansen particle size distributions to reproduce the extinction due to the\nproposed dust haze. We apply our method to 23 young L dwarfs and 23 red field L\ndwarfs. We constrain the properties of the dust haze including particle size\ndistribution and column density using Markov-Chain Monte Carlo methods. We find\nthat sub-micron range silicate grains reproduce the observed reddening. Current\nbrown dwarf atmosphere models include large grain (1--100~$\\mu m$) dust clouds\nbut not submicron dust grains. Our results provide a strong proof of concept\nand motivate a combination of large and small dust grains in brown dwarf\natmosphere models.\n", "  We introduce two tangle-based four-party entanglement measures $t_1$ and\n$t_2$, and two negativity-based measures $n_1$ and $n_2$, which are derived\nfrom the monogamy relations. These measures are computed for three four-qubit\nmaximally entangled and W states explicitly. We also compute these measures for\nthe rank-$2$ mixture $\\rho_4 = p \\ket{\\mbox{GHZ}_4} \\bra{\\mbox{GHZ}_4} + (1 -\np) \\ket{\\mbox{W}_4} \\bra{\\mbox{W}_4}$ by finding the corresponding optimal\ndecompositions. It turns out that $t_1 (\\rho_4)$ is trivial and the\ncorresponding optimal decomposition is equal to the spectral decomposition.\nProbably, this triviality is a sign of the fact that the corresponding monogamy\ninequality is not sufficiently tight. We fail to compute $t_2 (\\rho_4)$ due to\nthe difficulty for the calculation of the residual entanglement. The\nnegativity-based measures $n_1 (\\rho_4)$ and $n_2 (\\rho_4)$ are explicitly\ncomputed and the corresponding optimal decompositions are also derived\nexplicitly.\n", "  The recent discovery of topological insulator (TI) offers new opportunities\nfor the development of thermoelectrics, because many TIs (like Bi$_2$Te$_3$)\nare excellent thermoelectric (TE) materials. In this review, we will first\ndescribe the general TE properties of TIs and show that the coexistence of the\nbulk and boundary states in TIs introduces unusual TE properties, including\nstrong size effects and anomalous Seebeck effect. Importantly, the TE figure of\nmerit $zT$ of TIs is no longer an intrinsic property, but depends strongly on\nthe geometric size. The geometric parameters of two-dimensional TIs can be\ntuned to enhance $zT$ to be significantly greater than 1. Then a few\nproof-of-principle experiments on three-dimensional TIs will be discussed,\nwhich observed unconventional TE phenomena that are closely related to the\ntopological nature of the materials. However, current experiments indicate that\nthe metallic surface states, if their advantage of high mobility is not fully\nutilized, would be detrimental to TE performance. Finally we provide an outlook\nfor future work on topological materials, which offers great possibilities to\ndiscover exotic TE effects and may lead to significant breakthroughs in\nimproving $zT$.\n", "  A multitude of searches have already been performed by the ATLAS and CMS\ncollaborations at the LHC to probe the heavy Higgses of the Minimal\nSupersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) through their decay to the Standard Model\nparticles. In this paper, we study the decay of the MSSM heavy Higgses into\nneutralino and chargino pairs and estimate the maximum possible branching\nratios for these `ino' modes being consistent with the present LHC data. After\nperforming a random scan of the relevant electroweakino parameters, we impose\nthe SM 125 GeV Higgs constraints, low energy flavour data as well as current\nbounds on heavy Higgses from the LHC run-I and run-II data. The present limits\non the electroweakino masses and couplings are also considered in our analysis.\nWe choose a few representative benchmark points satisfying all the\nabove-mentioned constraints, and then perform a detailed collider simulation,\nincluding fast detector effects, and analyze all the potential SM backgrounds\nin order to estimate the discovery reach of these heavy Higgses at the LHC. We\nrestrict ourselves within the leptonic cascade decay modes of these heavy\nHiggses and study the mono-X + MET (X=W,Z) and trilepton + MET signatures in\nthe context of high luminosity run of the 14 TeV LHC.\n", "  We argue that lepton flavor violating (LFV) decays $M \\to \\ell_1 \\overline\n\\ell_2$ of quarkonium states $M$ with different quantum numbers could be used\nto put constraints on the Wilson coefficients of effective operators describing\nLFV interactions at low energy scales. We note that restricted kinematics of\nthe two-body quarkonium decays allows us to select operators with particular\nquantum numbers, significantly reducing the reliance on the single operator\ndominance assumption that is prevalent in constraining parameters of the\neffective LFV Lagrangian. We shall also argue that studies of radiative lepton\nflavor violating $M \\to \\gamma \\ell_1 \\overline \\ell_2$ decays could provide\nimportant complementary access to those effective operators.\n", "  We present the first three-dimensional gas-dynamical simulations of the\ngrazing envelope evolution (GEE) of stars, with the goal of exploring the basic\nflow properties and the role of jets at the onset of the GEE. In the simulated\nruns, a secondary main-sequence star grazes the envelope of the primary\nasymptotic giant branch (AGB) star. The orbit is circular at the radius of the\nAGB primary star on its equator. We inject two opposite jets perpendicular to\nthe equatorial plane from the location of the secondary star, and follow the\nevolution for several orbital periods. We explore the flow pattern by which the\njets eject the outskirts of the AGB envelope. After one orbit the jets start to\ninteract with gas ejected in previous orbits and inflate hot low-density\nbubbles.\n", "  We present a simultaneous, multi-wavelength campaign targeting the nearby\n(7.2 pc) L8/L9 (optical/near-infrared) dwarf WISEP J060738.65+242953.4 in the\nmid-infrared, radio, and optical. Spitzer Space Telescope observations show no\nvariability at the 0.2% level over 10 hours each in the 3.6 and 4.5 micron\nbands. Kepler K2 monitoring over 36 days in Campaign 0 rules out stable\nperiodic signals in the optical with amplitudes great than 1.5% and periods\nbetween 1.5 hours and 2 days. Non-simultaneous Gemini optical spectroscopy\ndetects lithium, constraining this L dwarf to be less than ~2 Gyr old, but no\nBalmer emission is observed. The low measured projected rotation velocity (v\nsin i < 6 km/s) and lack of variability are very unusual compared to other\nbrown dwarfs, and we argue that this substellar object is likely viewed\npole-on. We detect quiescent (non-bursting) radio emission with the VLA.\nAmongst radio detected L and T dwarfs, it has the lowest observed L_nu and the\nlowest v sin i. We discuss the implications of a pole-on detection for various\nproposed radio emission scenarios.\n", "  In most studies of dust in galaxies, dust is only detected from its emission\nto approximately the optical radius of the galaxy. By combining the signal of\n110 spiral galaxies observed as part of the Herschel Reference Survey, we are\nable to improve our sensitivity by an order-of-magnitude over that for a single\nobject. Here we report the direct detection of dust from its emission that\nextends out to at least twice the optical radius. We find that the distribution\nof dust is consistent with an exponential at all radii with a gradient of ~-1.7\ndex R$_{25}^{-1}$. Our dust temperature declines linearly from ~25 K in the\ncentre to 15 K at R$_{25}$ from where it remains constant out to ~2.0 R$_{25}$.\nThe surface-density of dust declines with radius at a similar rate to the\nsurface-density of stars but more slowly than the surface-density of the\nstar-formation rate. Studies based on dust extinction and reddening of\nhigh-redshift quasars have concluded that there are substantial amounts of dust\nin intergalactic space. By combining our results with the number counts and\nangular correlation function from the SDSS, we show that with Milky Way type\ndust we can explain the reddening of the quasars by the dust within galactic\ndisks alone. Given the uncertainties in the properties of any intergalactic\ndust, we cannot rule out its existence, but our results show that statistical\ninvestigations of the dust in galactic halos that use the reddening of\nhigh-redshift objects must take account of the dust in galactic disks.\n", "  We theoretically investigate the quantum transports in a junction between a\nsuperconductor and a silicene nanoribbon, under the effect of a magnetic\nexchange field. We find that for a narrow nanoribbon of silicene, remarkable\ncrossed Andreev reflection (with a fraction $>50\\%$) can be induced in the\nenergy window of the elastic cotunneling, by destroying some symmetries of the\nsystem. Since the energy responses of electrons to the exchange field are\nopposite for opposite spins, these transport channels can be well spin\npolarized. Moreover, due to the helicity conservation of the topological edge\nstates, these three transport channels are spatially separated in three\ndifferent locations of the device, making them experimentally distinguishable.\nThis crossed Andreev reflection is a nonlocal quantum interference between\nopposite edges through evanescent modes. If two superconducting leads with\ndifferent phases are connected to two edges of the silicene nanoribbon, the\ncrossed Andreev reflection can present Josephson type oscillations, with a\nmaximal fraction $\\sim 100\\%$.\n", "  We investigate the structural modulations induced by optical excitation of a\npolar phonon mode in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_7$, using first-principles calculations\nbased on density functional theory. We focus on the intense-excitation regime\nin which we expect that fourth-order phonon-phonon coupling terms dominate, and\nmodel the structural modulations induced by pulses of such intensity. Our\ncalculations of the phonon-phonon anharmonicities confirm that the cubic\ncoupling between modes, shown in earlier work to cause a quasi-static change in\nthe apical O - Cu distance and a buckling of the CuO$_2$ planes, is the leading\ncontribution at moderate pump strengths. At higher pump strengths ($\\sim$10\nMV/cm) the previously neglected quartic couplings become relevant and produce\nan additional shearing of the CuO$_2$ planes. Finally, we analyze the changes\nin the electronic and magnetic properties associated with the induced\nstructural changes.\n", "  We report on the observation of optical activity of quantum wells resulting\nin the conversion of the light polarization state controlled by the light\npropagation direction. The polarization conversion is detected in reflection\nmeasurements. We show that a pure $s$-polarized light incident on a quantum\nwell is reflected as an elliptically polarized wave. The signal is drastically\nenhanced in the vicinity of the light-hole exciton resonance. We show that the\npolarization conversion is caused by the spin-orbit splitting of the light hole\nstates and the birefringence of the studied structure. The bulk inversion\nasymmetry constant $\\beta_{h} \\approx 0.14$ eV\\AA, is determined for the ground\nlight hole subband in a 10 nm ZnSe/ZnMgSSe quantum well.\n", "  We present two different halo-independent methods to assess the compatibility\nof several direct dark matter detection data sets for a given dark matter model\nusing a global likelihood consisting of at least one extended likelihood and an\narbitrary number of Gaussian or Poisson likelihoods. In the first method we\nfind the global best fit halo function (we prove that it is a unique piecewise\nconstant function with a number of down steps smaller than or equal to a\nmaximum number that we compute) and construct a two-sided pointwise confidence\nband at any desired confidence level, which can then be compared with those\nderived from the extended likelihood alone to assess the joint compatibility of\nthe data. In the second method we define a \"constrained parameter\ngoodness-of-fit\" test statistic, whose $p$-value we then use to define a\n\"plausibility region\" (e.g. where $p \\geq 10\\%$). For any halo function not\nentirely contained within the plausibility region, the level of compatibility\nof the data is very low (e.g. $p < 10 \\%$). We illustrate these methods by\napplying them to CDMS-II-Si and SuperCDMS data, assuming dark matter particles\nwith elastic spin-independent isospin-conserving interactions or exothermic\nspin-independent isospin-violating interactions.\n", "  Almost 200 different species have been detected in the interstellar medium\n(ISM) during the last decades, revealing not only simple species but complex\nmolecules with more than 6 atoms. Other exotic compounds, like the weakly-bound\ndimer (H2)2, have also been detected in astronomical sources like Jupiter. We\naim at detecting for the first time the CO-H2 van der Waals complex in the ISM,\nwhich if detected can be a sensitive indicator for low temperatures. We use the\nIRAM30m telescope, located in Pico Veleta (Spain), to search for the CO-H2\ncomplex in a cold, dense core in TMC-1C (with a temperature of 10 K). All the\nbrightest CO-H2 transitions in the 3 mm (80-110 GHz) band have been observed\nwith a spectral resolution of 0.5-0.7 km/s, reaching a rms noise level of 2 mK.\nThe simultaneous observation of a broad frequency band, 16 GHz, has allowed us\nto conduct a serendipitous spectral line survey. No lines belonging to the\nCO-H2 complex have been detected. We have set up a new, more stringent upper\nlimit for its abundance to be [CO-H2]/[CO] = 5x10^{-6}, while we expect the\nabundance of the complex to be in the range 10^{-8}-10^{-3}. The spectral line\nsurvey has allowed us to detect 75 lines associated with 41 different species\n(including isotopologues). We detect a number of complex organic species, e.g.\nmethyl cyanide (CH3CN), methanol (CH3OH), propyne (CH3CCH) and ketene (CH2CO),\nassociated with cold gas (excitation temperatures about 7 K), confirming the\npresence of these complex species not only in warm objects but also in cold\nregimes.\n", "  We show that upon Tb substitution the interaction between the magnetic\nmoments on the impurity Tb$^{4+}$ ion and its surrounding Ir$^{4+}$ ions is\ndescribed by a \"compass\" model, i.e., Ising-like interaction favoring the\nmagnetic moments across each bond to align along the bond direction. Such\ninteraction nucleates quenched magnetic vortices near the impurities and drives\na reentrant transition out of the antiferromagnetic ordered phase at low\ntemperatures hence quickly suppresses the N\\'eel temperature consistent with\nthe experiment [Phys. Rev. B \\textbf{92}, 214411 (2015)]. As a by-product, we\npropose that the compass model can be realized in ordered double perovskites\ncomposed of the spin-orbital-coupled $d^{5}$ ions and the half-closed-shell\n$f^{7}$ ions.\n", "  Context. The accretion process in Classical T Tauri Stars (CTTSs) can be\nstudied through the analysis of some UV and X-ray emission lines which trace\nhot gas flows and act as diagnostics of the post-shock downfalling plasma. In\nthe UV band, where higher spectral resolution is available, these lines are\ncharacterized by rather complex profiles whose origin is still not clear.\n  Aims. We investigate the origin of UV and X-ray emission at impact regions of\ndensity structured (fragmented) accretion streams.We study if and how the\nstream fragmentation and the resulting structure of the post-shock region\ndetermine the observed profiles of UV and X-ray emission lines.\n  Methods. We model the impact of an accretion stream consisting of a series of\ndense blobs onto the chromosphere of a CTTS through 2D MHD simulations. We\nexplore different levels of stream fragmentation and accretion rates. From the\nmodel results, we synthesize C IV (1550 {\\AA}) and OVIII (18.97 {\\AA}) line\nprofiles.\n  Results. The impacts of accreting blobs onto the stellar chromosphere produce\nreverse shocks propagating through the blobs and shocked upflows. These\nupflows, in turn, hit and shock the subsequent downfalling fragments. As a\nresult, several plasma components differing for the downfalling velocity,\ndensity, and temperature are present altoghether. The profiles of C IV doublet\nare characterized by two main components: one narrow and redshifted to speed\n$\\approx$ 50 km s$^{-1}$ and the other broader and consisting of subcomponents\nwith redshift to speed in the range 200 $\\approx$ 400 km s$^{-1}$. The profiles\nof OVIII lines appear more symmetric than C IV and are redshifted to speed\n$\\approx$ 150 km s$^{-1}$.\n  Conclusions. Our model predicts profiles of C IV line remarkably similar to\nthose observed and explains their origin in a natural way as due to stream\nfragmentation.\n", "  We investigate the photometric modulation induced by magnetic activity cycles\nand study the relationship between rotation period and activity cycle(s) in\nlate-type (FGKM) stars. We analyse light-curves spanning up to 9 years of 125\nnearby stars provided by the ASAS survey. The sample is mainly conformed by\nlow-activity main sequence late A to mid M-type stars. A search is performed\nfor short (days) and long-term (years) periodic variations in the photometry.\nWe modelled with combinations of sinusoids the light-curves to measure the\nproperties of these periodic signals. To provide a better statistical\ninterpretation of our results we complement them with the results from previous\nsimilar works. We have been able to measure long-term photometric cycles of 47\nstars. Rotational modulation was also detected and rotational periods measured\nin 36 stars. For 28 stars we have simultaneous measurements of both, activity\ncycles and rotational periods, being 17 of them M-type stars. From sinusoidal\nfits we measured both photometric amplitudes and periods. The measured cycle\nperiods range from 2 up to 14 yr with photometric amplitudes in the range of\n5-20 mmag. We have found that the distribution of cycle lengths for the\ndifferent spectral types is similar. On the other hand the distribution of\nrotation periods is completely different, trending to longer periods for later\ntype stars. The amplitudes induced by magnetic cycles and rotation show a clear\ncorrelation. A trend of photometric amplitudes with rotation period is also\noutlined in the data. For a given activity index the amplitudes of the\nphotometric variability induced by activity cycles of main sequence GK stars\nare lower than those of early and mid-M dwarfs. Using spectroscopic data we\nalso provide an update in the empirical relationship between the level of\nchromospheric activity as given by log(Rhk) and the rotation periods.\n", "  We propose a closed formula for the tree-level one-point functions of\nnon-protected operators belonging to an SU(3) sub-sector of the defect CFT dual\nto the D3-D5 probe brane system with background gauge field flux, k, valid for\nk=2. The formula passes a number of non-trivial analytical and numerical tests.\nOur proposal is based on expressing the one-point functions as an overlap\nbetween a Bethe eigenstate of the SU(3) spin chain and a certain matrix product\nstate, deriving various factorization properties of the Gaudin norm and\nperforming explicit computations for shorter spin chains. As its SU(2)\ncounterpart, the one-point function formula for the SU(3) sub-sector is of\ndeterminant type. We discuss the the differences with the SU(2) case and the\nchallenges in extending the present formula beyond k=2.\n", "  We present new radial velocity (RV) measurements of old (horizontal branch)\nand intermediate-age (red clump) stellar tracers in the Carina dwarf\nspheroidal. They are based on more than 2,200 low-resolution spectra collected\nwith VIMOS at VLT. The targets are faint (20<V<21.5 mag), but the accuracy at\nthe faintest limit is <9 kms-1. These data were complemented with RV\nmeasurements either based on spectra collected with FORS2 and FLAMES/GIRAFFE at\nVLT or available in the literature. We ended up with a sample of 2748 stars and\namong them 1389 are candidate Carina stars. We found that the intermediate-age\nstellar component shows a well defined rotational pattern around the minor\naxis. The western and the eastern side of the galaxy differ by +5 and -4 km s-1\nwhen compared with the main RV peak. The old stellar component is characterized\nby a larger RV dispersion and does not show evidence of RV pattern. We compared\nthe observed RV distribution with N-body simulations for a former disky dwarf\ngalaxy orbiting a giant MilkyWay-like galaxy (Lokas et al. 2015). We rotated\nthe simulated galaxy by 60 degrees with respect to the major axis, we kept the\nobserver on orbital plane of the dwarf and extracted a sample of stars similar\nto the observed one. Observed and predicted Vrot/{\\sigma} ratios across the\ncentral regions are in remarkable agreement. This evidence indicates that\nCarina was a disky dwarf galaxy that experienced several strong tidal\ninteractions with the Milky Way. Owing to these interactions, Carina\ntransformed from a disky to a prolate spheroid and the rotational velocity\ntransformed into random motions.\n", "  In July 2015, the high-mass X-ray binary V 0332+53 underwent a giant\noutburst, a decade after the previous one. This system hosts a strongly\nmagnetized neutron star. During the 2004--2005 outburst, an anti-correlation\nbetween the centroid energy of its fundamental cyclotron resonance scattering\nfeatures (CRSFs) and the X-ray luminosity was observed. The long ($\\approx 100$\nd) and bright ($L_{\\rm x} \\approx 10^{38}$ erg s$^{-1}$) 2015 outburst offered\nthe opportunity to study during another outburst the unique properties of the\nfundamental CRSF and its dependence on the X-ray luminosity. The source was\nobserved by the INTEGRAL satellite for $\\sim 330$ ks. We exploit the spectral\nresolution at high energies of the SPectrometer on INTEGRAL (SPI) and the Joint\nEuropean X-ray Monitors to characterize its spectral properties, focusing in\nparticular on the CRSF-luminosity dependence. We complement the data of the\n2015 outburst with those collected by SPI in 2004--2005 and left unpublished so\nfar. We find a highly significant anti-correlation of the centroid energy of\nthe fundamental CRSF and the $3-100$ keV luminosity of $E_1 \\propto\n-0.095(8)L_{37}$ keV. This trend is observed for both outbursts. We confirm the\ncorrelation between the width of the fundamental CRSF and the X-ray luminosity\npreviously found in the JEM-X and IBIS dataset of the 2004--2005 outburst. By\nexploiting the RXTE/ASM and Swift/BAT monitoring data we also report on the\ndetection of a $\\sim 34$ d modulation superimposed on the mean profiles and\nroughly consistent with the orbital period of the pulsar. We discuss possible\ninterpretations of such variability.\n", "  We analyze new high spatial resolution (~60 pc) ALMA CO(2-1) observations of\nthe isolated luminous infrared galaxy ESO 320-G030 (d=48 Mpc) in combination\nwith ancillary HST optical and near-IR imaging as well as VLT/SINFONI near-IR\nintegral field spectroscopy. We detect a high-velocity (~450 km/s) spatially\nresolved (size~2.5 kpc; dynamical time ~3 Myr) massive (~10^7 Msun; mass\nrate~2-8 Msun/yr) molecular outflow originated in the central ~250 pc. We\nobserve a clumpy structure in the outflowing cold molecular gas with clump\nsizes between 60 and 150 pc and masses between 10^5.5 and 10^6.4 Msun. The mass\nof the clumps decreases with increasing distance, while the velocity is\napproximately constant. Therefore, both the momentum and kinetic energy of the\nclumps decrease outwards. In the innermost (~100 pc) part of the outflow, we\nmeasure a hot-to-cold molecular gas ratio of 7x10^-5, which is similar to that\nmeasured in other resolved molecular outflows. We do not find evidence of an\nionized phase in this outflow. The nuclear IR and radio properties are\ncompatible with strong and highly obscured star-formation (A_k ~ 4.6 mag;\nSFR~15 Msun/yr). We do not find any evidence for the presence of an active\ngalactic nucleus. We estimate that supernova explosions in the nuclear\nstarburst (\\nu(SN) ~ 0.2 yr^-1) can power the observed molecular outflow. The\nkinetic energy and radial momentum of the cold molecular phase of the outflow\ncorrespond to about 2% and 20%, respectively, of the supernovae output. The\ncold molecular outflow velocity is lower than the escape velocity, so the gas\nwill likely return to the galaxy disk. The mass loading factor is ~0.1-0.5, so\nthe negative feedback due to this star-formation powered molecular outflow is\nprobably limited.\n", "  We report a detailed simulation and classical density functional theory study\nof the drying transition in a realistic model fluid at a smooth substrate. This\ntransition (in which the contact angle $\\theta\\to 180^\\circ$) is shown to be\ncritical for both short ranged and long-ranged substrate-fluid interaction\npotentials. In the latter case critical drying occurs at exactly zero\nattractive substrate strength. This observation permits the accurate\nelucidation of the character of the transition via a finite-size scaling\nanalysis of the density probability function. We find that the critical\nexponent $\\nu_\\parallel$ that controls the parallel correlation length, i.e.\nthe extent of vapor bubbles at the wall, is over twice as large as predicted by\nmean field and renormalization group calculations. We suggest a reason for the\ndiscrepancy. Our findings shed new light on fluctuation phenomena in fluids\nnear hydrophobic and solvophobic interfaces.\n", "  Understanding the interaction of primordial gravitational waves (GWs) with\nthe Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) plasma is important for observational\ncosmology. In this article, we provide an analysis of an effect apparently\noverlooked as yet. We consider a single free electric charge and suppose that\nit can be agitated by primordial GWs propagating through the CMB plasma,\nresulting in periodic, regular motion along particular directions. Light\nreflected by the charge will be partially polarized, and this will imprint a\ncharacteristic pattern on the CMB. We study this effect by considering a simple\nmodel in which anisotropic incident electromagnetic (EM) radiation is\nrescattered by a charge sitting in spacetime perturbed by GWs and becomes\npolarized. As the charge is driven to move along particular directions, we\ncalculate its dipole moment to determine the leading-order rescattered EM\nradiation. The Stokes parameters of the rescattered radiation exhibit a net\nlinear polarization. We investigate how this polarization effect can be\nschematically represented out of the Stokes parameters. We work out the\nrepresentations of gradient modes (E-modes) and curl modes (B-modes) to produce\npolarization maps. Although the polarization effect results from GWs, we find\nthat its representations, the E- and B-modes, do not practically reflect the GW\nproperties such as strain amplitude, frequency and polarization states.\n", "  We report the discovery and analysis of the most metal-poor damped\nLyman-alpha (DLA) system currently known, which also displays the Lyman series\nabsorption lines of neutral deuterium. The average [O/H] abundance of this\nsystem is [O/H] = -2.804 +/- 0.015, which includes an absorption component with\n[O/H] = -3.07 +/- 0.03. Despite the unfortunate blending of many weak D I\nabsorption lines, we report a precise measurement of the deuterium abundance of\nthis system. Using the six highest quality and self-consistently analyzed\nmeasures of D/H in DLAs, we report tentative evidence for a subtle decrease of\nD/H with increasing metallicity. This trend must be confirmed with future high\nprecision D/H measurements spanning a range of metallicity. A weighted mean of\nthese six independent measures provides our best estimate of the primordial\nabundance of deuterium, 10^5 (D/H)_P = 2.547 +/- 0.033 (log_10 (D/H)_P =\n-4.5940 +/- 0.0056). We perform a series of detailed Monte Carlo calculations\nof Big Bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) that incorporate the latest determinations of\nseveral key nuclear cross sections, and propagate their associated uncertainty.\nCombining our measurement of (D/H)_P with these BBN calculations yields an\nestimate of the cosmic baryon density, 100 Omega_B,0 h^2(BBN) = 2.156 +/-\n0.020, if we adopt the most recent theoretical determination of the\nd(p,gamma)3He reaction rate. This measure of Omega_B,0 h^2 differs by ~2.3\nsigma from the Standard Model value estimated from the Planck observations of\nthe cosmic microwave background. Using instead a d(p,gamma)3He reaction rate\nthat is based on the best available experimental cross section data, we\nestimate 100 Omega_B,0 h^2(BBN) = 2.260 +/- 0.034, which is in somewhat better\nagreement with the Planck value. Forthcoming measurements of the crucial\nd(p,gamma)3He cross section may shed further light on this discrepancy.\n", "  We develop a simple and general method to construct arbitrary Flat Band\nlattices. We identify the basic ingredients behind zero-dispersion bands and\ndevelop a method to construct extended lattices based on a consecutive\nrepetition of a given mini-array. The number of degenerated localized states is\ndefined by the number of connected mini-arrays times the number of modes\npreserving the symmetry at a given connector site. In this way, we create one\nor more (depending on the lattice geometry) complete degenerated Flat Bands for\nquasi-one and two-dimensional systems. We probe our method by studying several\nexamples, and discuss the effect of additional interactions like anisotropy or\nnonlinearity. At the end, we test our method by studying numerically a ribbon\nlattice using a continuous description.\n", "  The six-degree obliquity of the sun suggests that either an asymmetry was\npresent in the solar system's formation environment, or an external torque has\nmisaligned the angular momentum vectors of the sun and the planets. However,\nthe exact origin of this obliquity remains an open question. Batygin & Brown\n(2016) have recently shown that the physical alignment of distant Kuiper Belt\norbits can be explained by a 5-20 Earth-mass planet on a distant, eccentric,\nand inclined orbit, with an approximate perihelion distance of ~250 AU. Using\nan analytic model for secular interactions between Planet Nine and the\nremaining giant planets, here we show that a planet with similar parameters can\nnaturally generate the observed obliquity as well as the specific pole position\nof the sun's spin axis, from a nearly aligned initial state. Thus, Planet Nine\noffers a testable explanation for the otherwise mysterious spin-orbit\nmisalignment of the solar system.\n", "  We investigate the 3.45-eV luminescence band of spontaneously formed GaN\nnanowires on Si(111) by photoluminescence and cathodoluminescence spectroscopy.\nThis band is found to be particularly prominent for samples synthesized at\ncomparatively low temperatures. At the same time, these samples exhibit a\npeculiar morphology, namely, isolated long nanowires are interspersed within a\ndense matrix of short ones. Cathodoluminescence intensity maps reveal the\n3.45-eV band to originate primarily from the long nanowires. Transmission\nelectron microscopy shows that these long nanowires are either Ga polar and are\njoined by an inversion domain boundary with their short N-polar neighbors, or\nexhibit a Ga-polar core surrounded by a N-polar shell with a tubular inversion\ndomain boundary at the core/shell interface. For samples grown at high\ntemperatures, which exhibit a uniform nanowire morphology, the 3.45-eV band is\nalso found to originate from particular nanowires in the ensemble and thus\npresumably from inversion domain boundaries stemming from the coexistence of N-\nand Ga-polar nanowires. For several of the investigated samples, the 3.45-eV\nband splits into a doublet. We demonstrate that the higher-energy component of\nthis doublet arises from the recombination of two-dimensional excitons free to\nmove in the plane of the inversion domain boundary. In contrast, the\nlower-energy component of the doublet originates from excitons localized in the\nplane of the inversion domain boundary. We propose that this in-plane\nlocalization is due to shallow donors in the vicinity of the inversion domain\nboundaries.\n", "  Galaxies which strongly deviate from the radio-far IR correlation are of\ngreat importance for studies of galaxy evolution as they may be tracing early,\nshort-lived stages of starbursts and active galactic nuclei (AGNs). The most\nextreme FIR-excess galaxy NGC1377 has long been interpreted as a young dusty\nstarburst, but millimeter observations of CO lines revealed a powerful\ncollimated molecular outflow which cannot be explained by star formation alone.\nWe present new radio observations at 1.5 and 10 GHz obtained with the Jansky\nVery Large Array (JVLA) and Chandra X-ray observations towards NGC1377. The\nobservations are compared to synthetic starburst models to constrain the\nproperties of the central energy source. We obtained the first detection of the\ncm radio continuum and X-ray emission in NGC1377. We find that the radio\nemission is distributed in two components, one on the nucleus and another\noffset by 4$\"$.5 to the South-West. We confirm the extreme FIR-excess of the\ngalaxy, with a $q_\\mathrm{FIR}\\simeq$4.2, which deviates by more than\n7-$\\sigma$ from the radio-FIR correlation. Soft X-ray emission is detected on\nthe off-nucleus component. From the radio emission we estimate for a young\n($<10$ Myr) starburst a star formation rate SFR$<$0.1 M$_\\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. Such\na SFR is not sufficient to power the observed IR luminosity and to drive the CO\noutflow. We find that a young starburst cannot reproduce all the observed\nproperties of the nucleus of NGC1377. We suggest that the galaxy may be\nharboring a radio-quiet, obscured AGN of 10$^6$M$_\\odot$, accreting at\nnear-Eddington rates. We speculate that the off-nucleus component may be\ntracing an hot-spot in the AGN jet.\n", "  We present a new multi-pixel high resolution (R >10^7) spectrometer for the\nStratospheric Observatory for Far-Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA). The receiver uses\n2 x 7-pixel subarrays in orthogonal polarization, each in an hexagonal array\naround a central pixel. We present the first results for this new instrument\nafter commissioning campaigns in May and December 2015 and after science\nobservations performed in May 2016 . The receiver is designed to ultimately\ncover the full 1.8-2.5 THz frequency range but in its first implementation, the\nobserving range was limited to observations of the [CII] line at 1.9 THz in\n2015 and extended to 1.83-2.07 THz in 2016. The instrument sensitivities are\nstate-of-the-art and the first scientific observations performed shortly after\nthe commissioning confirm that the time efficiency for large scale imaging is\nimproved by more than an order of magnitude as compared to single pixel\nreceivers. An example of large scale mapping around the Horsehead Nebula is\npresented here illustrating this improvement. The array has been added to\nSOFIA's instrument suite already for ongoing observing cycle 4.\n", "  Using universal properties and a basic statistical mechanical approach, we\npropose a general equation of state for unitary Fermi gases. The universal\nequation of state is written as a series solution to a self consistent integral\nequation where the general solution is a linear combination of Fermi functions.\nFirst, by truncating our series solution to four terms with already known exact\ntheoretical inputs at limiting cases, namely the first \\emph{three} virial\ncoefficients and using the Bertsch parameter as a free parameter, we find a\ngood agreement with experimental measurements in the entire temperature region\nin the normal state. This analytical equation of state agrees with experimental\ndata up to the fugacity $z = 18$, which is a vast improvement over the other\nanalytical equations of state available where the agreements is \\emph{only} up\nto $z \\approx 7$. Second, by truncating our series solution to four terms again\nusing first \\emph{four} virial coefficients, we find the Bertsch parameter $\\xi\n=0.35$, which is in good agreement with the direct experimental measurement of\n$\\xi =0.37$. This second form of equation of state shows a good agreement with\nself-consistent T-matrix calculations in the normal phase.\n", "  We present the current status of the analytic theory of brown dwarf evolution\nand the lower mass limit of the hydrogen burning main sequence stars. In the\nspirit of a simplified analytic theory we also introduce some modifications to\nthe existing models. We give an exact expression for the pressure of an ideal\nnon-relativistic Fermi gas at a finite temperature, therefore allowing for\nnon-zero values of the degeneracy parameter ($\\psi = \\frac{kT}{\\mu_{F}}$, where\n$\\mu_{F}$ is the Fermi energy). We review the derivation of surface luminosity\nusing an entropy matching condition and the first-order phase transition\nbetween the molecular hydrogen in the outer envelope and the partially-ionized\nhydrogen in the inner region. We also discuss the results of modern simulations\nof the plasma phase transition, which illustrate the uncertainties in\ndetermining its critical temperature. Based on the existing models and with\nsome simple modification we find the maximum mass for a brown dwarf to be in\nthe range $0.064M_\\odot-0.087M_\\odot$. An analytic formula for the luminosity\nevolution allows us to estimate the time period of the non-steady state (i.e.,\nnon-main sequence) nuclear burning for substellar objects. Standard models also\npredict that stars that are just above the substellar mass limit can reach an\nextremely low luminosity main sequence after at least a few million years of\nevolution, and sometimes much longer. We estimate that $\\simeq 11 \\%$ of stars\ntake longer than $10^7$ yr to reach the main-sequence, and $\\simeq 5 \\%$ of\nstars take longer than $10^8$ yr.\n", "  Energies and lifetimes (widths) of vibrational states above the lowest\ndissociation limit of $^{16}$O$_3$ were determined using a previously-developed\nefficient approach, which combines hyperspherical coordinates and a complex\nabsorbing potential. The calculations are based on a recently-computed\npotential energy surface of ozone determined with a spectroscopic accuracy [J.\nChem. Phys. {\\bf 139}, 134307 (2013)]. The effect of permutational symmetry on\nrovibrational dynamics and the density of resonance states in O$_3$ is\ndiscussed in detail. Correspondence between quantum numbers appropriate for\nshort- and long-range parts of wave functions of the rovibrational continuum is\nestablished. It is shown, by symmetry arguments, that the allowed purely\nvibrational ($J=0$) levels of $^{16}$O$_3$ and $^{18}$O$_3$, both made of\nbosons with zero nuclear spin, cannot dissociate on the ground state potential\nenergy surface. Energies and wave functions of bound states of the ozone\nisotopologue $^{16}$O$_3$ with rotational angular momentum $J=0$ and 1 up to\nthe dissociation threshold were also computed. For bound levels, good agreement\nwith experimental energies is found: The RMS deviation between observed and\ncalculated vibrational energies is 1~\\cm. Rotational constants were determined\nand used for a simple identification of vibrational modes of calculated levels.\n", "  To take full advantage of the unprecedented power of upcoming weak lensing\nsurveys, understanding the noise, such as cosmic variance and geometry/mask\neffects, is as important as understanding the signal itself. Accurately\nquantifying the noise requires a large number of statistically independent\nmocks for a variety of cosmologies. This is impractical for weak lensing\nsimulations, which are costly for simultaneous requirements of large box size\n(to cover a significant fraction of the past light cone) and high resolution\n(to robustly probe the small scale where most lensing signal resides).\nTherefore fast mock generation methods are desired and are under intensive\ninvestigation. We propose a new fast weak lensing map generation method, named\nthe inverse-Gaussianization method, based on the finding that a lensing\nconvergence field can be Gaussianized to excellent accuracy by a local\ntransformation [Yu et al, Phys. Rev. D 84, 023523 (2011)]. Given a simulation,\nit enables us to produce as many as infinite statistically independent lensing\nmaps as fast as producing the simulation initial conditions. The proposed\nmethod is tested against simulations for each tomography bin centered at lens\nredshift $z \\sim 0.5$, 1, and 2, with various statistics. We find that the\nlensing maps generated by our method have reasonably accurate power spectra,\nbispectra, and power spectrum covariance matrix. Therefore, it will be useful\nfor weak lensing surveys to generate realistic mocks. As an example of\napplication, we measure the probability distribution function of the lensing\npower spectrum, from 16384 lensing maps produced by the inverse-Gaussianization\nmethod.\n", "  Collective coupling between dipoles can dramatically modify the optical\nresponse of a medium. Such effects depend strongly on the geometry of the\nmedium and the polarization of the light. Using a classical coupled dipole\nmodel, here we investigate the simplest case of one dimensional (1D) arrays of\ninteracting atomic dipoles driven by a weak laser field. Changing the\npolarization and direction of the driving field allows us to separately address\nsuperradiant, subradiant, red-shifted, and blue-shifted eigenmodes, as well as\nobserve strong Fano-like interferences between different modes. The cooperative\neigenvectors can be characterized by the phase difference between nearest\nneighbor dipoles, ranging from all oscillating in phase to all oscillating out\nof phase with their nearest neighbors. Investigating the eigenvalue behavior as\na function of atom number and lattice spacing, we find that certain eigenmodes\nof an infinite atomic chain have the same decay rate as a single atom between\ntwo mirrors. The effects we observe provide a framework for collective control\nof the optical response of a medium, giving insight into the behavior of more\ncomplicated geometries, as well as providing further evidence for the dipolar\nanalog of cavity QED.\n", "  We study the nonlinear gravitational dynamics of a universe filled with a\npressureless fluid and a cosmological constant $\\Lambda$ in the context of\nNewtonian gravity, and in the relativistic post-Friedmann approach proposed in\npaper I [I. Milillo et al., Phys. Rev. D 92, 023519 (2015).]. The\npost-Friedmann approximation scheme is based on the $1/c$ expansion of the\nspace-time metric and the energy-momentum tensor, and includes nonlinear\nNewtonian cosmology. Here we establish the nonlinear post-Friedmann framework\nin the Lagrangian-coordinates approach for structure formation. For this we\nfirst identify a Lagrangian gauge which is suitable for incorporating nonzero\nvorticity. We analyze our results in two limits: at the leading order we\nrecover the fully nonlinear Newtonian cosmological equations in the Lagrangian\nformulation, and we provide a space-time metric consistent from the perspective\nof general relativity. We then linearize our expressions and recover the\nrelativistic results at first order in cosmological perturbation theory.\nTherefore, the introduced approximation scheme provides a unified treatment for\nthe two leading-order regimes, from the small scales described by Newtonian\ngravity to the large linear scale, where first-order relativistic cosmological\nperturbation theory gives a very good description of structure formation.\n", "  We present an analysis of surveying the inner Solar System for objects that\nmay pose some threat to the Earth. Most of the analysis is based on\nunderstanding the capability provided by Sentinel, a concept for an infrared\nspace-based telescope placed in a heliocentric orbit near the distance of\nVenus. From this analysis, we show 1) the size range being targeted can affect\nthe survey design, 2) the orbit distribution of the target sample can affect\nthe survey design, 3) minimum observational arc length during the survey is an\nimportant metric of survey performance, and 4) surveys must consider objects as\nsmall as D=15-30 m to meet the goal of identifying objects that have the\npotential to cause damage on Earth in the next 100 years. Sentinel will be able\nto find 50% of all impactors larger than 40 meters in a 6.5 year survey. The\nSentinel mission concept is shown to be as effective as any survey in finding\nobjects bigger than D=140 m but is more effective when applied to finding\nsmaller objects on Earth-impacting orbits. Sentinel is also more effective at\nfinding objects of interest for human exploration that benefit from lower\npropulsion requirements. To explore the interaction between space and ground\nsearch programs, we also study a case where Sentinel is combined with the Large\nSynoptic Survey Telescope and show the benefit of placing a space-based\nobservatory in an orbit that reduces the overlap in search regions with a\nground-based telescope. In this case, Sentinel+LSST can find more than 70% of\nthe impactors larger than 40 meters assuming a 6.5 year lifetime for Sentinel\nand 10 years for LSST.\n", "  Universal scaling terms occurring in Renyi entanglement entropies have the\npotential to bring new understanding to quantum critical points in free and\ninteracting systems. Quantitative comparisons between analytical continuum\ntheories and numerical calculations on lattice models play a crucial role in\nadvancing such studies. In this paper, we exactly calculate the universal\ntwo-cylinder shape dependence of entanglement entropies for free bosons on\nfinite-size square lattices, and compare to approximate functions derived in\nthe continuum using several different ansatzes. Although none of these ansatzes\nare exact in the thermodynamic limit, we find that numerical fits are in good\nagreement with continuum functions derived using the AdS/CFT correspondence, an\nextensive mutual information model, and a quantum Lifshitz model. We use fits\nof our lattice data to these functions to calculate universal scalars defined\nin the thin-cylinder limit, and compare to values previously obtained for the\nfree boson field theory in the continuum.\n", "  We have performed inelastic neutron scattering measurements on a powder\nsample of the superconductor lithium iron selenide hydroxide\nLi$_{1-x}$Fe$_{x}$ODFe$_{1-y}$Se ($x \\simeq 0.16, y \\simeq 0.02$, $T_{\\rm c} =\n41$\\,K). The spectrum shows an enhanced intensity below $T_{\\rm c}$ over an\nenergy range $0.64\\times2\\Delta < E < 2\\Delta$, where $\\Delta$ is the\nsuperconducting gap, with maxima at the wave vectors $Q_1 \\simeq\n1.46$\\,\\AA$^{-1}$ and $Q_2 \\simeq 1.97$\\,\\AA$^{-1}$. The behavior of this\nfeature is consistent with the spin resonance mode found in other\nunconventional superconductors, and strongly resembles the spin resonance\nobserved in the spectrum of the molecular-intercalated iron selenide,\nLi$_{0.6}$(ND$_{2}$)$_{0.2}$(ND$_{3}$)$_{0.8}$Fe$_{2}$Se$_{2}$. The signal can\nbe described with a characteristic two-dimensional wave vector $(\\pi, 0.67\\pi)$\nin the Brillouin zone of the iron square lattice, consistent with the nesting\nvector between electron Fermi sheets.\n", "  The Wide Angle Camera of the OSIRIS instrument on board the Rosetta\nspacecraft is equipped with several narrowband filters that are centered on the\nemission lines and bands of various fragment species. These are used to\ndetermine the evolution of the production and spatial distribution of the gas\nin the inner coma of comet 67P with time and heliocentric distance, here\nbetween 2.6 - 1.3 AU pre-perihelion. Our observations indicate that the\nemission observed in the OH, OI, CN, NH, and NH2 filters is mostly produced by\ndissociative electron impact excitation of different parent species. We\nconclude that CO2 rather than H2O is a significant source of the [OI] 630 nm\nemission. A strong plume-like feature observed in the in CN and [OI] filters is\npresent throughout our observations. This plume is not present in OH emission\nand indicates a local enhancement of the CO2/H2O ratio by as much as a factor\nof 3. We observed a sudden decrease in intensity levels after March 2015, which\nwe attribute to decreased electron temperatures in the first kilometers above\nthe nucleus surface.\n", "  The Disk Detective citizen science project aims to find new stars with 22\nmicron excess emission from circumstellar dust using data from NASA's WISE\nmission. Initial cuts on the AllWISE catalog provide an input catalog of\n277,686 sources. Volunteers then view images of each source online in 10\ndifferent bands to identify false-positives (galaxies, background stars,\ninterstellar matter, image artifacts, etc.). Sources that survive this online\nvetting are followed up with spectroscopy on the FLWO Tillinghast telescope.\nThis approach should allow us to unleash the full potential of WISE for finding\nnew debris disks and protoplanetary disks. We announce a first list of 37 new\ndisk candidates discovered by the project, and we describe our vetting and\nfollow-up process. One of these systems appears to contain the first debris\ndisk discovered around a star with a white dwarf companion: HD 74389. We also\nreport four newly discovered classical Be stars (HD 6612, HD 7406, HD 164137,\nand HD 218546) and a new detection of 22 micron excess around a previously\nknown debris disk host star, HD 22128.\n", "  In arXiv:1407.8203, we introduced the idea of s-sourcery, a general formalism\nfor building many-body quantum ground states using\nrenormalization-group-inspired quantum circuits. Here we define a generalized\nnotion of s-sourcery that applies to mixed states, and study its properties and\napplicability. We prove a number of theorems establishing the prevalence of\nmixed s-source fixed points. For our examples we focus on thermal states of\nlocal Hamiltonians. Thermal double states (also called thermofield double\nstates) and the machinery of approximate conditional independence are used\nheavily in the constructions.\n", "  Collaborative international efforts under the name of the Event Horizon\nTelescope project, using sub- mm very long baseline interferometry, are soon\nexpected to provide the first images of the shadow cast by the candidate\nsupermassive black hole in our Galactic center, Sagittarius A*. Observations of\nthis shadow would provide direct evidence of the existence of astrophysical\nblack holes. Although it is expected that astrophysical black holes are\ndescribed by the axisymmetric Kerr solution, there also exist many other black\nhole solutions, both in general relativity and in other theories of gravity,\nwhich cannot presently be ruled out. To this end, we present calculations of\nblack hole shadow images from various metric theories of gravity as described\nby our recent work on a general parameterisation of axisymmetric black holes\n[R. Konoplya, L. Rezzolla and A. Zhidenko, Phys. Rev. D 93, 064015 (2016)]. An\nalgorithm to perform general ray-tracing calculations for any metric theory of\ngravity is first outlined and then employed to demonstrate that even for\nextremal metric deformation parameters of various black hole spacetimes, this\nparameterisation is both robust and rapidly convergent to the correct solution.\n", "  Electromagnetic waves arise in many area of physics. Solutions are difficult\nto find in the general case. In this paper, we numerically integrate Maxwell\nequations in a 3D spherical polar coordinate system. Straightforward finite\ndifference methods would lead to a coordinate singularity along the polar axis.\nSpectral methods are better suited to deal with such artificial singularities\nrelated to the choice of a coordinate system. When the radiating object is\nrotating like for instance a star, special classes of solutions to Maxwell\nequations are worthwhile to study such as quasi-stationary regimes. Moreover,\nin high-energy astrophysics, strong gravitational and magnetic fields are\npresent especially around rotating neutron stars. In order to study such\nsystems, we designed an algorithm to solve the time-dependent Maxwell equations\nin spherical polar coordinates including general relativity as well as quantum\nelectrodynamical corrections to leading order. As a diagnostic, we compute the\nspindown luminosity expected from these stars and compare it to the classical\ni.e. non relativistic and non quantum mechanical results. It is shown that\nquantum electrodynamics leads to an irrelevant change in the spindown\nluminosity even for magnetic field around the critical value of\n$\\numprint{4.4e9}$~\\si{\\tesla}. Therefore the braking index remains close to\nits value for a point dipole in vacuum namely $n=3$. The same conclusion holds\nfor a general-relativistic quantum electrodynamically corrected force-free\nmagnetosphere.\n", "  We investigate the high-speed ($v >$ 1000 km s$^{-1}$) extreme-ultraviolet\n(EUV) wave associated with an X1.2 flare and coronal mass ejection (CME) from\nNOAA active region 11283 on 2011 September 6 (SOL2011-09-06T22:12). This EUV\nwave features peculiar on-disk signatures, in particular we observe an\nintermittent \"disappearance\" of the front for 120 s in SDO/AIA 171, 193, 211\n{\\AA} data, whereas the 335 {\\AA} filter, sensitive to hotter plasmas\n(T$\\sim$2.5 MK), shows a continuous evolution of the wave front. The eruption\nwas also accompanied by localized coronal dimming regions. We exploit the\nmulti-point quadrature position of SDO and STEREO-A, to make a thorough\nanalysis of the EUV wave evolution, with respect to its kinematics and\namplitude evolution and reconstruct the SDO line-of-sight (LOS) direction of\nthe identified coronal dimming regions in STEREO-A. We show that the observed\nintensities of the dimming regions in SDO/AIA depend on the structures that are\nlying along their LOS and are the combination of their individual intensities,\ne.g. the expanding CME body, the enhanced EUV wave and CME front. In this\ncontext, we conclude that the intermittent disappearance of the EUV wave in the\nAIA 171, 193, 211 {\\AA} filters, which are channels sensitive to plasma with\ntemperatures below $\\sim$2 MK is also caused by such LOS integration effects.\nThese observations clearly demonstrate that single-view image data provide us\nwith limited insight to correctly interpret coronal features.\n", "  We present and analyze Subaru/IRCS L' and M' images of the nearby M dwarf VHS\nJ125601.92-125723.9 (VHS 1256), which was recently claimed to have a ~11 M_Jup\ncompanion (VHS 1256 b) at ~102 au separation. Our AO images partially resolve\nthe central star into a binary, whose components are nearly equal in brightness\nand separated by 0.106\" +/- 0.001\". VHS 1256 b occupies nearly the same near-IR\ncolor-magnitude diagram position as HR 8799 bcde and has a comparable L'\nbrightness. However, it has a substantially redder H - M' color, implying a\nrelatively brighter M' flux density than for the HR 8799 planets and suggesting\nthat non-equilibrium carbon chemistry may be less significant in VHS 1256 b. We\nsuccessfully match the entire SED (optical through thermal infrared) for VHS\n1256 b to atmospheric models assuming chemical equilibrium, models which failed\nto reproduce HR 8799 b at 5 microns. Our modeling favors slightly thick clouds\nin the companion's atmosphere, although perhaps not quite as thick as those\nfavored recently for HR 8799 bcde. We estimate that the system is at least\nolder than 200 Myr and the masses of the stars comprising the central binary\nare at least 58 M_Jup each. Moreover, we find some of the properties of VHS\n1256 are inconsistent with the recent suggestion that it is a member of the AB\nDor moving group. Given the possible ranges in distance (12.7 pc vs. 17.1 pc),\nthe lower mass limit for VHS 1256 b ranges from 10.5 - 26.2 M_Jup. Our\ndetection limits rule out companions more massive than VHS 1256 b exterior to\n6-8 au, placing significant limits on and providing some evidence against a\nsecond, more massive companion that may have scattered the wide-separation\ncompanion to its current location. VHS 1256 is most likely a very low mass\nhierarchical triple system, and could be the third such system in which all\ncomponents reside in the brown dwarf mass regime.\n", "  Electron transport in thin metallic wires and films is strongly influenced by\nthe quality of their surface. Weak localization and magnetoconductivity are\nalso sensitive to the electron scattering at the edges of the sample. We study\nweak localization effects in a two-dimensional electron gas patterned in the\nform of a narrow quasi-one-dimensional channel in transverse magnetic field.\nThe most general boundary conditions interpolating between the limits of mirror\nand diffuse edge scattering are assumed. We calculate magnetoconductivity for\nan arbitrary width of the sample including the cases of diffusive and ballistic\nlateral transport as well as the crossover between them. We find that in a\nbroad range of parameters, the electron mobility is limited by the boundary\nroughness while the magnetotransport is only weakly influenced by the quality\nof the edges. In addition, we calculate magnetoconductivity for a metallic\ncylinder in the transverse field and a quasi-two-dimensional metallic film in\nthe parallel field.\n", "  We used the newly commissioned 50 cm Binocular Network (50BiN) telescope at\nQinghai Station of Purple Mountain Observatory (Chinese Academy of Sciences) to\nobserve the old open cluster NGC 188 in V and R as part of a search for\nvariable objects. Our time-series data span a total of 36 days. Radial velocity\nand proper-motion selection resulted in a sample of 532 genuine cluster\nmembers. Isochrone fitting was applied to the cleaned cluster sequence,\nyielding a distance modulus of (m - M)0V = 11.35 \\pm 0.10 mag and a total\nforeground reddening of E(V - R) = 0.062 \\pm 0.002 mag. Light-curve solutions\nwere obtained for eight W Ursae Majoris eclipsing-binary systems (W UMas) and\ntheir orbital parameters were estimated. Using the latter parameters, we\nestimate a distance to the W UMas which is independent of the host cluster's\nphysical properties. Based on combined fits to six of the W UMas (EP Cep, EQ\nCep, ES Cep, V369 Cep, and--for the first time--V370 Cep and V782 Cep), we\nobtain an average distance modulus of (m - M)0V = 11.31 \\pm 0.08 mag, which is\ncomparable with that resulting from our isochrone fits. These six W UMas\nexhibit an obvious period-luminosity relation. We derive more accurate physical\nparameters for the W UMa systems and discuss their initial masses and ages. The\nformer show that these W UMa systems have likely undergone angular-momentum\nevolution within a convective envelope (W-type evolution). The ages of the W\nUMa systems agree well with the cluster's age.\n", "  Thermal properties of the $S=1/2$ kagome Heisenberg antiferromagnet at low\ntemperatures are investigated by means of the Hams-de Raedt method for clusters\nof up to 36 sites possessing a full symmetry of the lattice. The specific heat\nexhibits, in addition to the double peaks, the third and the forth peaks at\nlower temperatures. With decreasing the temperature, the type of the magnetic\nshort-range order (SRO) changes around the third-peak temperature from the\n$\\sqrt{3} \\times \\sqrt{3}$ to the $q$=0 states, suggesting that the third peak\nof the specific heat is associated with a crossover phenomenon between the\nspin-liquid states with distinct magnetic SRO. Experimental implications are\ndiscussed.\n", "  We try to retrieve the power spectra with certainty to the highest spatial\nfrequencies allowed by current instrumentation. For this, we use 2D inversion\ncode that were able to recover information up to the instrumental diffraction\nlimit. The retrieved power spectra have shallow slopes extending further down\nto much smaller scales than found before. They seem not to show any power law.\nThe observed slopes at subgranular scales agree with those obtained from recent\nlocal dynamo simulations. Small differences are found for vertical component of\nkinetic energy that suggest that observations suffer from an instrumental\neffect that is not taken into account.\n", "  We report a method to characterize the propagation of an ultrashort pulse of\nlight through a multiple scattering medium by measuring its time-resolved\ntransmission matrix. This method is based on the use of a spatial light\nmodulator together with a coherent time-gated detection of the transmitted\nspeckle field. Using this matrix, we demonstrate the focusing of the scattered\npulse at any arbitrary position in space and time after the medium. Our\napproach opens new perspectives for both fundamental studies and applications\nin imaging and coherent control in disordered media.\n", "  Ultra-compact dwarf galaxies (UCDs) share many properties with globular\nclusters (GCs) and are found in similar environments. A large sample of UCDs\nand GCs around NGC 1399, the central giant elliptical of the Fornax galaxy\ncluster, is used to infer their formation history and also that of NGC 1399. We\nassumed that all GCs and UCDs in our sample are star clusters (SCs) and used\nthem as tracers of past star formation activities. After correcting our GC/UCD\nsample for mass loss, we interpreted their overall mass function to be a\nsuperposition of SC populations that formed coevally during different times.\nThe SC masses of each population were distributed according to the embedded\ncluster mass function (ECMF), a pure power law with the slope $-\\beta$ and a\nstellar upper mass limit, $M_{\\mathrm{max}}$, which depended on the star\nformation rate (SFR). We decomposed the observed GC/UCD mass function into\nindividual SC populations and converted $M_{\\mathrm{max}}$ of each SC\npopulation to an SFR. The overall distribution of SFRs reveals how the GC/UCD\nsample formed. Considering the age of the GCs/UCDs and the present stellar mass\nof NGC 1399, we found that the formation of the GCs/UCDs can be well explained\nfor $\\beta<2.3$. This agrees very well with the observation in young SCs where\n$\\beta\\approx2.0$ is usually found. Even if taking into account that some of\nthe most massive objects might not be genuine SCs and applying different\ncorrections for the mass loss, the outcome is not influenced much. We found\npeak SFRs between approximately 300 and 3000 $M_{\\odot}\\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$, which\nmatches the SFRs observed in massive high-$z$ sub-mm galaxies and an SFR\nestimate inferred from NGC 1399 based on \"downsizing\", i.e. more massive\ngalaxies must have formed over shorter times. Our results suggest that NGC 1399\nand its GC/UCD system formed in an early, short, and intense starburst.\n", "  It is known that not all summation methods are linear and stable. Zeta\nfunction regularization is in general non-linear. However, in some cases formal\nmanipulations with \"zeta function\" regularization (assuming linearity of sums)\nlead to correct results. We consider several examples and show why this\nhappens.\n", "  We study a six matrix model with global $SO(3)\\times SO(3)$ symmetry\ncontaining at most quartic powers of the matrices. This theory exhibits a phase\ntransition from a geometrical phase at low temperature to a Yang-Mills matrix\nphase with no background geometrical structure at high temperature. This is an\nexotic phase transition in the same universality class as the three matrix\nmodel but with important differences. The geometrical phase is determined\ndynamically, as the system cools, and is given by a fuzzy four-sphere\nbackground ${\\bf S}^2_N\\times{\\bf S}^2_N$, with an Abelian gauge field which is\nvery weakly coupled to two normal scalar fields playing the role of dark\nenergy.\n", "  Guided movement in response to slowly diffusing polymeric trails provides a\nunique mechanism for self-organization of some microorganisms. To elucidate how\nthis signaling route leads to microcolony formation, we experimentally probe\nthe trajectory and orientation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa that propel themselves\non a surface using type IV pili motility appendages, which preferentially\nattach to deposited exopolysaccharides. We construct a stochastic model by\nanalyzing single-bacterium trajectories, and show that the resulting\ntheoretical prediction for the many-body behavior of the bacteria is in\nquantitative agreement with our experimental characterization of how cells\nexplore the surface via a power law strategy.\n", "  We present a determination of the supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass\nfunction for early- and late-type galaxies in the nearby universe (z<0.0057),\nestablished from a volume-limited sample consisting of a statistically complete\ncollection of the brightest spiral galaxies in the southern hemisphere. The\nsample is defined by limiting luminosity (redshift-independent) distance,\nD_L=25.4 Mpc, and a limiting absolute B-band magnitude, M_B=-19.12. These\nlimits define a sample of 140 spiral, 30 elliptical (E), and 38 lenticular (S0)\ngalaxies. We established the Sersic index distribution for early-type (E/S0)\ngalaxies in our sample. Davis et al. (2014) established the pitch angle\ndistribution for their sample, which is identical to our late-type (spiral)\ngalaxy sample. We then used the pitch angle and the Sersic index distributions\nin order to estimate the SMBH mass function for our volume-limited sample. The\nobservational simplicity of our approach relies on the empirical relation\nbetween the mass of the central (SMBH) and the Sersic index (Graham et al.\n2007) for an early-type galaxy or the logarithmic spiral arm pitch angle\n(Berrier et al. 2013) for a spiral galaxy. Our SMBH mass function agrees well\nat the high-mass end with previous values in the literature. At the low-mass\nend, while inconsistencies exist in previous works that still need to be\nresolved, our work is more in line with expectations based on modeling of black\nhole evolution.\n", "  We present chemical abundances derived from high-resolution Magellan/MIKE\nspectra of the nine brightest known red giant members of the ultra-faint dwarf\ngalaxy Reticulum II. These stars span the full metallicity range of Ret II\n(-3.5 < [Fe/H] < -2). Seven of the nine stars have extremely high levels of\nr-process material ([Eu/Fe]~1.7), in contrast to the extremely low\nneutron-capture element abundances found in every other ultra-faint dwarf\ngalaxy studied to date. The other two stars are the most metal-poor stars in\nthe system ([Fe/H] < -3), and they have neutron-capture element abundance\nlimits similar to those in other ultra-faint dwarf galaxies. We confirm that\nthe relative abundances of Sr, Y, and Zr in these stars are similar to those\nfound in r-process halo stars but ~0.5 dex lower than the solar r-process\npattern. If the universal r-process pattern extends to those elements, the\nstars in Ret II display the least contaminated known r-process pattern. The\nabundances of lighter elements up to the iron peak are otherwise similar to\nabundances of stars in the halo and in other ultra-faint dwarf galaxies.\nHowever, the scatter in abundance ratios is large enough to suggest that\ninhomogeneous metal mixing is required to explain the chemical evolution of\nthis galaxy. The presence of low amounts of neutron-capture elements in other\nultra-faint dwarf galaxies may imply the existence of additional r-process\nsites besides the source of r-process elements in Ret II. Galaxies like Ret II\nmay be the original birth sites of r-process enhanced stars now found in the\nhalo.\n", "  Initial C/O ratios of circumstellar disks have been obtained in solar-type\nstars by differential photospheric abundance analysis with respect to the Sun.\nWe present C/O ratios of M dwarfs obtained by absolute abundance analysis\nderived from CO and H2O spectra in the K-band. We compare the distributions of\nC/O ratios in M dwarfs and solar-type stars using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.\nThe C/O distribution of M dwarfs is consistent with low frequency of high C/O\nratios in solar-type stars.\n", "  We study the possibility of using quadrupole moments of auto-convolved galaxy\nimages to measure cosmic shear. The autoconvolution of an image corresponds to\nthe inverse Fourier transformation of its power spectrum. The new method has\nthe following advantages: the smearing effect due to the Point Spread Function\n(PSF) can be corrected by subtracting the quadrupole moments of the\nauto-convolved PSF; the centroid of the auto-convolved image is trivially\nidentified; the systematic error due to noise can be directly removed in\nFourier space; the PSF image can also contain noise, the effect of which can be\nsimilarly removed. With a large ensemble of simulated galaxy images, we show\nthat the new method can reach a sub-percent level accuracy in general\nconditions, albeit with increasingly large stamp size for galaxies of less\ncompact profiles.\n", "  The excitonic spectra of single layer GeS and GeSe are predicted by ab initio\nGW-Bethe Salpeter equation calculations. G 0 W 0 calculations for the band\nstructures find a fundamental band gap of 2.85 eV for GeS and 1.70 eV for GeSe\nmonolayer. However, excitons are tightly bound, specially in GeS at the\n{\\Gamma} point, where the quasi-particle interactions are so strong that they\nshift the {\\Gamma} exciton peak energy into the visible range and below the\noff-{\\Gamma} exciton peak. The lowest energy excitons in both materials are\nexcited by light along the zigzag direction and have exciton binding energies\nof 1.05 eV and 0.4 eV, respectively, but despite the strong binding, the\ncalculated binding energies are in agreement with a Mott-Wannier model.\n", "  Stellar scattering off irregularities in a galaxy disk has been shown to make\nan exponential radial profile, but no fundamental reason for this has been\nsuggested. Here we show that exponentials are mathematically expected from\nrandom scattering in a disk when there is a slight inward bias in the\nscattering probability. Such a bias was present in our previous scattering\nexperiments that formed exponential profiles. Double exponentials can arise\nwhen the bias varies with radius. This is a fundamental property of scattering\nand may explain why piece-wise exponential profiles are ubiquitous in galaxies,\neven after minor mergers and other disruptive events.\n", "  We study here an alternative technique to probe the Dark Ages (DA) and the\nEpoch of Reonization (EoR) that makes use of the Comptonization of the CMB\nspectrum modified by physical effects occurring during this epoch related to\nthe emergence of the 21-cm radiation background. Inverse Compton scattering of\n21-cm photon background by thermal and non-thermal electrons residing in the\natmospheres of cosmic structures like galaxy clusters, radiogalaxy lobes and\ngalaxy halos, produces a specific form of Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (SZE) that\nwe refer to as SZE-21cm. We derive the SZE-21cm in a general relativistic\napproach which is required to describe the correct spectral features of this\nastrophysical effect. We calculate the spectral features of the thermal and\nnon-thermal SZE-21cm in galaxy clusters and in radiogalaxy lobes, and their\ndependence on the history of physical mechanisms occurring during the DA and\nEoR. We study how the spectral shape of the SZE-21cm can be used to establish\nthe global features in the mean 21-cm spectrum generated during and prior to\nthe EoR, and how it depends on the properties of the (thermal and non-thermal)\nplasma in cosmic structures. We find that the thermal and non-thermal SZE-21cm\nhave peculiar spectral shapes that allow to investigate the physics and history\nof the EoR and DA. Its spectrum depends on the gas temperature (for the thermal\nSZE-21cm) and on the electrons minimum momentum (for the non-thermal SZE-21cm).\nThe global SZE-21cm signal can be detected (in $\\sim 1000$ hrs) by SKA1-low in\nthe frequency range $\\nu \\simgt 75-90$ MHz, for clusters in the temperature\nrange 5 to 20 keV, and the difference between the SZE-21cm and the standard SZE\ncan be detected by SKA1 or SKA2 at frequencies depending on the background\nmodel and the cluster temperature. [abridged]\n", "  The Andreev bound states and charge transport in a Josephson junction between\ntwo superconductors with intrinsic exchange fields are studied. We find that\nfor a parallel configuration of the exchange fields in the superconductors the\ndiscrete spectrum consists of two pairs of spin-split states. The Josephson\ncurrent in this case is mainly carried by bound states. In contrast, for the\nantiparallel configuration we find that there is no spin-splitting of the bound\nstates and that for phase differences smaller than certain critical value there\nare no bound states at all. Hence the supercurrent is only carried by states in\nthe continuous part of the spectrum. Our predictions can be tested by\nperforming a tunneling spectroscopy of a weak link between two spin-split\nsuperconductors.\n", "  We present digital tables for the radiative terms that appear in the energy\nand momentum equations used to simulate the accretion onto supermassive black\nholes (SMBHs) in the center of galaxies. Cooling and heating rates and\nradiative accelerations are calculated with two different Spectral Energy\nDistributions (SEDs). One SED is composed of an accretion disk +\n[X-ray]-powerlaw, while the other is made of an accretion disk +\n[Corona]-bremsstrahlung with $T_X=1.16 \\times 10^8$ K, where precomputed\nconditions of adiabatic expansion are included. Quantification of different\nphysical mechanisms at operation are presented, showing discrepancies and\nsimilarities between both SEDs in different ranges of fundamental physical\nparameters (i.e., ionization parameter, density, and temperature). With the\nrecent discovery of outflows originating at sub-parsec scales, these tables may\nprovide a useful tool to model gas accretion processes onto a SMBH.\n", "  We present mid-infrared photometry of the Orion Bar obtained with FORCAST\naboard SOFIA at 6.4, 6.6, 7.7, 19.7, 31.5 and 37.1 \\um. By complementing this\nobservations with archival FORCAST and \\emph{Herschel}/PACS images we are able\nto construct a complete infrared spectral energy distribution of the Huygens\nregion in the Orion nebula By comparing the infrared images with gas tracers,\nwe find that PACS maps trace the molecular cloud, while the FORCAST data trace\nthe photodissociation region (PDR) and HII region. Analysis of the energetics\nof the region reveal that the PDR extends for 0.28~pc along the line-of-sight\nand that the Bar is inclined at an angle of $4\\degr$. The infrared and\nsubmillimeter images reveal that the Orion Bar represents a swept up shell with\na thickness of 0.1~pc. The mass of the shell implies a shock velocity of\n$\\simeq 3$ km/s and an age of $\\simeq 10^5$ yr for the HII region. Our analysis\nshows that the UV and infrared dust opacities in the HII region and the PDR are\na factor 5 to 10 lower than in the diffuse interstellar medium. In the ionized\ngas, Ly$\\alpha$ photons are a major source of dust heating at distances larger\nthan $\\simeq0.06$~pc from \\toc. Dust temperatures can be explained if the size\nof the grains is between 0.1 to 1~\\um. We derive the photo-electric heating\nefficiency of the atomic gas in the Orion Bar. The results are in good\nqualitative agreement with models and The quantitative differences indicate a\ndecreased PAH abundance in this region.\n", "  Investigations into the substructure of massive star forming regions are\nessential for understanding the observed relationships between core mass\ndistributions and mass distributions in stellar clusters, differentiating\nbetween proposed mechanisms of massive star formation. We study the\nsubstructure in the two largest fragments (i.e. cores) MM1 and MM2, in the\ninfrared dark cloud complex SDC13. As MM1 appears to be in a later stage of\nevolution than MM2, comparing their substructure provides an insight in to the\nearly evolution of massive clumps. We report the results of high resolution SMA\ndust continuum observations towards MM1 and MM2. Combining these data with\nHerschel observations, we carry out RADMC-3D radiative transfer modelling to\ncharacterise the observed substructure.\n  SMA continuum data indicates 4 sub-fragments in the SDC13 region. The nature\nof the second brightest sub-fragment (B) is uncertain as it does not appear as\nprominent at the lower MAMBO resolution or at radio wavelengths. Statistical\nanalysis indicates that it is unlikely to be a background source, an AGB star,\nor the free-free emission of a HII region. It is plausible that B is a runaway\nobject ejected from MM1. MM1, which is actively forming stars, consists of two\nsub-fragments A and C. This is confirmed by 70 micron Herschel data. While MM1\nand MM2 appear quite similar in previous low resolution observations, at high\nresolution, the sub-fragment at the centre of MM2 (D) is much fainter than\nsub-fragment at the centre of MM1 (A). RADMC-3D models of MM1 and MM2 are able\nto reproduce these results, modelling MM2 with a steeper density profile and\nhigher mass than is required for MM1. The relatively steep density profile of\nMM2 depends on a significant temperature decrease in its centre, justified by\nthe lack of star formation in MM2. A final stellar population for MM1 was\nextrapolated, indicating a ...\n", "  We have monitored photometrically the Y0 brown dwarf WISEP\nJ173835.52+273258.9 (W1738) at both near- and mid-infrared wavelengths. This ~1\nGyr-old 400K dwarf is at a distance of 8pc and has a mass around 5 M_Jupiter.\nWe observed W1738 using two near-infrared filters at lambda~1um, Y and J, on\nGemini observatory, and two mid-infrared filters at lambda~4um, [3.6] and\n[4.5], on the Spitzer observatory. Twenty-four hours were spent on the source\nby Spitzer on each of June 30 and October 30 2013 UT. Between these\nobservations, around 5 hours were spent on the source by Gemini on each of July\n17 and August 23 2013 UT. The mid-infrared light curves show significant\nevolution between the two observations separated by four months. We find that a\ndouble sinusoid can be fit to the [4.5] data, where one sinusoid has a period\nof 6.0 +/- 0.1 hours and the other a period of 3.0 +/- 0.1 hours. The\nnear-infrared observations suggest variability with a ~3.0 hour period,\nalthough only at a <~2 sigma confidence level. We interpret our results as\nshowing that the Y dwarf has a 6.0 +/- 0.1 hour rotation period, with one or\nmore large-scale surface features being the source of variability. The\npeak-to-peak amplitude of the light curve at [4.5] is 3%. The amplitude of the\nnear-infrared variability, if real, may be as high as 5 to 30%. Intriguingly,\nthis size of variability and the wavelength dependence can be reproduced by\natmospheric models that include patchy KCl and Na_2S clouds and associated\nsmall changes in surface temperature. The small number of large features, and\nthe timescale for evolution of the features, is very similar to what is seen in\nthe atmospheres of the solar system gas giants.\n", "  We perform systematic first-principles calculations of the proximity exchange\ncoupling, induced by cobalt (Co) and nickel (Ni) in graphene, via a few (up to\nthree) layers of hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). We find that the induced spin\nsplitting of the graphene bands is of the order of 10 meV for a monolayer of\nhBN, decreasing in magnitude but alternating in sign by adding each new\ninsulating layer. We find that the proximity exchange can be giant if there is\na resonant $d$ level of the transition metal close to the Dirac point. Our\ncalculations suggest that this effect could be present in Co heterostructures,\nin which a $d$ level strongly hybridizes with the valence-band orbitals of\ngraphene. Since this hybridization is spin dependent, the proximity spin\nsplitting is unusually large, about 10 meV even for two layers of hBN. An\nexternal electric field can change the offset of the graphene and\ntransition-metal orbitals and can lead to a reversal of the sign of the\nexchange parameter. This we predict to happen for the case of two monolayers of\nhBN, enabling electrical control of proximity spin polarization (but also spin\ninjection) in graphene/hBN/Co structures. Nickel-based heterostructures show\nweaker proximity effects than cobalt heterostructures. We introduce two\nphenomenological models to describe the first-principles data. The minimal\nmodel comprises the graphene (effective) $p_z$ orbitals and can be used to\nstudy transport in graphene with proximity exchange, while the $p_z$-$d$ model\nalso includes hybridization with $d$ orbitals, which is important to capture\nthe giant proximity exchange. Crucial to both models is the\npseudospin-dependent exchange coupling, needed to describe the different spin\nsplittings of the valence and conduction bands.\n", "  We report a detail theoretical study of the electronic structure and phase\nstability of transition metal oxides MnO, FeO, CoO, and NiO in their\nparamagnetic cubic B1 structure by employing dynamical mean-field theory of\ncorrelated electrons combined with \\emph{ab initio} band structure methods\n(DFT+DMFT). Our calculations reveal that under pressure these materials exhibit\na Mott insulator-metal transition (IMT) which is accompanied by a simultaneous\ncollapse of local magnetic moments and lattice volume, implying a complex\ninterplay between chemical bonding and electronic correlations. Moreover, our\nresults for the transition pressure show a monotonous decrease from ~ 145 GPa\nto 40 GPa, upon moving from MnO to CoO. In contrast to that, in NiO, magnetic\ncollapse is found to occur at remarkably higher pressure of ~ 429 GPa. We\nprovide a unified picture of such a behavior and suggest that it is primary a\nlocalized to itinerant moment behavior transition at the IMT that gives rise to\nmagnetic collapse in transition metal oxides.\n", "  We use a nanofluidic system to investigate the emergence of thermally driven\ncollective phenomena along a single polymer chain. In our approach, a single\nDNA molecule is confined in a nanofluidic slit etched with arrays of embedded\nnanocavities; the cavity lattice is designed so that a single chain occupies\nmultiple cavities. Fluorescent video-microscopy data shows that waves of excess\nfluorescence propagate across the cavity-straddling molecule, corresponding to\npropagating fluctuations of contour overdensity in the cavities. The waves are\nquantified by examining the correlation in intensity fluctuations between\nneighbouring cavities. Correlations grow from an anti-correlated minimum to a\ncorrelated maximum before decaying, corresponding to a transfer of contour\nbetween neighbouring cavities at a fixed transfer time-scale. The observed\ndynamics can be modelled using Langevin dynamics simulations and a minimal\nlattice model of coupled diffusion. This study shows how confinement-based\nsculpting of the polymer equilibrium configuration, by renormalizing the\nphysical system into a series of discrete cavity states, can lead to new types\nof dynamic collective phenomena.\n", "  We report our very early optical observations of GRB 110530A and investigate\nits jet properties together with its X-ray afterglow data. A peculiar broad\nonset bump followed by a plateau is observed in its early R band afterglow\nlightcurve. The optical data in the other bands and the X-ray data are well\nconsistent with the temporal feature of the R band lightcurve. Our joint\nspectral fits of the optical and X-ray data show that they are in the same\nregime, with a photon index of $\\sim 1.70$. The optical and X-ray afterglow\nlightcurves are well fitted with the standard external shock model by\nconsidering a delayed energy injection component. Based on our modeling\nresults, we find that the radiative efficiency of the GRB jet is $\\sim 1\\%$ and\nthe magnetization parameter of the afterglow jet is $<0.04$ with the derived\nextremely low $\\epsilon_B$ (the fraction of shock energy to magnetic field) of\n$(1.64\\pm 0.25)\\times 10^{-6}$. These results indicate that the jet may be\nmatter dominated. Discussion on delayed energy injection from accretion of late\nfall-back material of its pre-supernova star is also presented.\n", "  We consider a spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensate with Rashba spin-orbit coupling\nand dipole-dipole interaction confined in a cigar-shaped trap. Due to the\ncombined effects of spin-orbit coupling, dipole-dipole interaction, and trap\ngeometry, the system exhibits a rich variety of ground-state spin structures,\nincluding twisted spin vortices. The ground-state phase diagram is determined\nwith respect to the strengths of the spin-orbit coupling and dipole-dipole\ninteraction.\n", "  BRITE (BRIght Target Explorer) Constellation, the first nanosatellite mission\napplied to astrophysical research, is a collaboration among Austria, Canada and\nPoland. The fleet of satellites (6 launched, 5 functioning) performs precise\noptical photometry of the brightest stars in the night sky. A pioneering\nmission like BRITE - with optics and instruments restricted to small volume,\nmass and power in several nanosatellites, whose measurements must be\ncoordinated in orbit - poses many unique challenges. We discuss the technical\nissues, including problems encountered during on-orbit commissioning\n(especially higher-than expected sensitivity of the CCDs to particle\nradiation). We describe in detail how the BRITE team has mitigated these\nproblems, and provide a complete overview of mission operations. This paper\nserves as a template for how to effectively plan, build and operate future\nlow-cost niche-driven space astronomy missions.\n", "  The positron annihilation gamma-ray signal in the Milky Way (MW) shows a\npuzzling morphology: a very bright bulge and a very low surface-brightness\ndisk. A coherent explanation of the positron origin, propagation through the\nGalaxy and subsequent annihilation in the interstellar medium has not yet been\nfound. Tentative explanations involve positrons from radioactivity, X-ray\nbinaries, and dark matter (DM). Dwarf satellite galaxies (DSGs) are believed to\nbe DM-dominated and hence promising candidates in the search for 511 keV\nemission as a result of DM annihilation into electron-positron pairs. The goal\nof this study is to constrain possible 511 keV gamma-ray signals from 39 DSGs\nof the MW and to test the annihilating DM scenario. We use the spectrometer SPI\non INTEGRAL to extract individual spectra for the studied objects. As the\ndiffuse galactic emission dominates the signal, the large scale morphology of\nthe MW has been modelled accordingly and was included in a maximum likelihood\nanalysis. Alternatively, a distance-weighted stacked spectrum has been\ndetermined. Only Reticulum II (Ret II) shows a 3.1 sigma signal. Five other\nsources show tentative 2 sigma signals. The mass-to-511-keV-luminosity-ratio\nshows a marginal trend towards higher values for intrinsically brighter\nobjects, opposite to the V band mass-to-light-ratio, which is generally used to\nuncover DM in DSGs. All derived flux values are above the level implied by a DM\ninterpretation of the MW bulge signal. The signal from Ret II is unlikely to be\nrelated to a DM origin alone, otherwise, the MW bulge would be about 100 times\nbrighter than what is seen. Ret II is exceptional considering the DSG sample,\nand rather points to enhanced recent star formation activity, if its origins\nare similar to processes in the MW. Understanding this emission may provide\nfurther clues regarding the origin of the annihilation emission in the MW.\n", "  We present a theory of the phononic thermal (Kapitza) resistance at the\ninterface between graphene or another single-layer two-dimensional (2D) crystal\n(e.g. MoS$_{2}$) and a flat substrate, based on a modified version of the\ncross-plane heat transfer model by Persson, Volokitin and Ueba [J. Phys.:\nCondens. Matter 23, 045009 (2011)]. We show how intrinsic flexural phonon\ndamping is necessary for obtaining a finite Kapitza resistance and also\ngeneralize the theory to encased single-layer 2D crystals with a superstrate.\nWe illustrate our model by computing the thermal boundary conductance (TBC) for\nbare and SiO$_{2}$-encased single-layer graphene and MoS$_{2}$ on a SiO$_{2}$\nsubstrate, using input parameters from first-principles calculation. The\nestimated room temperature TBC for bare (encased) graphene and MoS$_{2}$ on\nSiO$_{2}$ are 34.6 (105) and 3.10 (5.07) MWK$^{-1}$m$^{-2}$, respectively. The\ntheory predicts the existence of a phonon frequency crossover point, below\nwhich the low-frequency flexural phonons in the bare 2D crystal do not\ndissipate energy efficiently to the substrate. We explain within the framework\nof our theory how the encasement of graphene with a top SiO$_{2}$ layer\nintroduces new low-frequency transmission channels which significantly reduce\nthe graphene-substrate Kapitza resistance. We emphasize that the distinction\nbetween bare and encased 2D crystals must be made in the analysis of\ncross-plane heat dissipation to the substrate.\n", "  We compute the three-loop four-gluon scattering amplitude in maximally\nsupersymmetric Yang-Mills theory, including its full color dependence. Our\nresult is the first complete computation of a non-planar four-particle\nscattering amplitude to three loops in four-dimensional gauge theory and\nconsequently provides highly non-trivial data for the study of non-planar\nscattering amplitudes. We present the amplitude as a Laurent expansion in the\ndimensional regulator to finite order, with coefficients composed of harmonic\npoly-logarithms of uniform transcendental weight, and simple rational\nprefactors. Our computation provides an independent check of a recent result\nfor three-loop corrections to the soft anomalous dimension matrix that predicts\nthe general infrared singularity structure of massless gauge theory scattering\namplitudes. Taking the Regge limit of our result, we determine the three-loop\ngluon Regge trajectory. We also find agreement with very recent predictions for\nsub-leading logarithms.\n", "  We report the discovery of variable radio emission associated with the T\nTauri star, V830 Tau, which was recently shown to host a hot Jupiter companion.\nVery Large Array observations at a frequency of 6 GHz reveal a detection on 01\nMay 2011 with a flux density $919 \\pm 26\\ \\mu$Jy, along with non-detections in\ntwo other epochs at $<66$ and $<150\\ \\mu$Jy. Additionally, Very Long Baseline\nArray observations include one detection and one non-detection at comparable\nsensitivity, demonstrating that the emission is nonthermal in origin. The\nemission is consistent with the gyro-synchrotron or synchrotron mechanism from\na region with a magnetic field ${\\stackrel{\\scriptstyle >}{\\scriptstyle \\sim}}\n30$ G, and is likely driven by an energetic event such as magnetic reconnection\nthat accelerated electrons. With the limited data we have, we are not able to\nplace any constraint on the relationship between the radio emission and the\nrotational or orbital properties of V830 Tau. This is the first detection of\nradio emission from a non-degenerate star known to host an exoplanet.\n", "  We provide the possible resolution for the century old problem of\nhydrodynamic shear flows, which are apparently stable in linear analysis but\nshown to be turbulent in astrophysically observed data and experiments. This\nmismatch is noticed in a variety of systems, from laboratory to astrophysical\nflows. There are so many uncountable attempts made so far to resolve this\nmismatch, beginning with the early work of Kelvin, Rayleigh, and Reynolds\ntowards the end of the nineteenth century. Here we show that the presence of\nstochastic noise, whose inevitable presence should not be neglected in the\nstability analysis of shear flows, leads to pure hydrodynamic linear\ninstability therein. This explains the origin of turbulence, which has been\nobserved/interpreted in astrophysical accretion disks, laboratory experiments\nand direct numerical simulations. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the\nfirst solution to the long standing problem of hydrodynamic instability of\nRayleigh stable flows.\n", "  We present a study of ro-vibrational OH and CO emission from 21 disks around\nHerbig Ae/Be stars. We find that the OH and CO luminosities are proportional\nover a wide range of stellar ultraviolet luminosities. The OH and CO line\nprofiles are also similar, indicating that they arise from roughly the same\nradial region of the disk. The CO and OH emission are both correlated with the\nfar-ultraviolet luminosity of the stars, while the PAH luminosity is correlated\nwith the longer wavelength ultraviolet luminosity of the stars. Although disk\nflaring affects the PAH luminosity, it is not a factor in the luminosity of the\nOH and CO emission. These properties are consistent with models of\nUV-irradiated disk atmospheres. We also find that the transition disks in our\nsample, which have large optically thin inner regions, have lower OH and CO\nluminosities than non-transition disk sources with similar ultraviolet\nluminosities. This result, while tentative given the small sample size, is\nconsistent with the interpretation that transition disks lack a gaseous disk\nclose to the star.\n", "  Millisecond pulsars (MSPs) are thought to originate from low-mass X-ray\nbinaries (LMXBs). The discovery of eclipsing radio MSPs including redbacks and\nblack widows indicates that evaporation of the donor star by the MSP's\nirradiation takes place during the LMXB evolution. In this work, we investigate\nthe effect of donor evaporation on the secular evolution of LMXBs, considering\ndifferent evaporation efficiencies and related angular momentum loss. We find\nthat for widening LMXBs, the donor star leaves a less massive white dwarf than\nwithout evaporation; for contracting systems, evaporation can speed up the\nevolution, resulting in dynamically unstable mass transfer and possibly the\nformation of isolated MSPs.\n", "  Aims. We obtained Herschel/PACS imaging and spectroscopic observations of the\nnebula surrounding the candidate LBV HD168625. By combining these data with\noptical spectra of the star, we want to constrain the abundances in the nebula\nand in the star and compare them to trace back its evolution.\n  Methods. We use CMFGEN to determine the fundamental parameters and the CNO\nabundances of the central star whilst the abundances of the nebula are derived\nfrom the emission lines present in the Herschel/PACS spectrum.\n  Result. The FIR images show a nebula composed of an elliptical ring/torus of\nejecta with a ESE-WNW axis and of a second perpendicular bipolar structure\ncomposed of empty caps/rings. We detect equatorial shells composed of dust and\nionized material with different sizes when observed at different wavelengths,\nand bipolar caps more of less separated from the central star in H$\\alpha$ and\nmid-IR images. This complex global structure seems to show 2 different\ninclinations: 40{\\deg} for the equatorial torus and 60{\\deg} for the bipolar\nejections. From the Herschel/PACS spectrum, we determine nebular abundances of\n$\\mathrm{N/H} = 4.1 \\pm 0.8 \\times~10^{-4}$ and $\\mathrm{C/H} \\sim\n1.6_{-0.35}^{+1.16} \\times~10^{-4}$, as well as a mass of ionized gas of\n$0.17\\pm 0.04$M$_{\\odot}$ and a neutral hydrogen mass of about $1.0\\pm\n0.3$M$_{\\odot}$ which dominates. Analysis of the central star reveals Teff =\n14000K, log g = 1.74 and log (L/L$_{\\odot}$) = 5.58. We derive stellar\nabundances of about $\\mathrm{N/H} = 5.0 \\pm 1.5 \\times~10^{-4}$, $\\mathrm{C/H}\n= 1.4 \\pm 0.5 \\times~10^{-4}$ and $\\mathrm{O/H} = 3.5 \\pm 1.0\\times~10^{-4}$.\nAll these measurements taken together are compatible with the evolutionary\ntracks of a star with an initial mass between $28$ and $33$M$_{\\odot}$ and with\na crit. rotational rate between 0.3 and 0.4 that has lost its material during\nor just after the BSG phase.\n", "  The effective potential neighboring the corotation resonance region in barred\ngalaxies is shown to be strongly time-dependent in any rotating frame because\nof the competition of nearby perturbations of similar strengths with differing\nrotation speeds. Contrary to the generally adopted assumption, that in the bar\nrotating frame the corotation region should possess four stationary equilibrium\npoints (Lagrange points), with high quality N-body simulations we localize the\ninstantaneous equilibrium points and find that they circulate or oscillate\nbroadly in azimuth with respect to the pattern speeds of the inner or outer\nperturbations. This implies that at the particle level the Jacobi integral is\nnot well conserved around the corotation radius. That is, angular momentum\nexchanges decouple from energy exchanges, enhancing the chaotic diffusion of\nstars through the corotation region.\n", "  We present the results of a reverberation campaign targeting MGC-06-30-15.\nSpectrophotometric monitoring and broad-band photometric monitoring over the\ncourse of 4 months in the spring of 2012 allowed a determination of a time\ndelay in the broad H$\\beta$ emission line of $\\tau=5.3\\pm1.8$ days in the rest\nframe of the AGN. Combined with the width of the variable portion of the\nemission line, we determine a black hole mass of $M_{\\rm BH} = (1.6 \\pm 0.4)\n\\times 10^6$ M$_{\\odot}$. Both the H$\\beta$ time delay and the black hole mass\nare in good agreement with expectations from the $R_{\\rm BLR}$-$L$ and $M_{\\rm\nBH}-\\sigma_{\\star}$ relationships for other reverberation-mapped AGNs. The\nH$\\beta$ time delay is also in good agreement with the relationship between\nH$\\beta$ and broad-band near-IR delays, in which the effective BLR size is\n$\\sim 4-5$ times smaller than the inner edge of the dust torus. Additionally,\nthe reverberation-based mass is in good agreement with estimates from the X-ray\npower spectral density break scaling relationship, and with constraints based\non stellar kinematics derived from integral field spectroscopy of the inner\n$\\sim 0.5$ kpc of the galaxy.\n", "  The Protoplanetary Discussions conference --- held in Edinburgh, UK, from 7th\n--11th March 2016 --- included several open sessions led by participants. This\npaper reports on the discussions collectively concerned with the multiphysics\nmodelling of protoplanetary discs, including the self-consistent calculation of\ngas and dust dynamics, radiative transfer and chemistry. After a short\nintroduction to each of these disciplines in isolation, we identify a series of\nburning questions and grand challenges associated with their continuing\ndevelopment and integration. We then discuss potential pathways towards solving\nthese challenges, grouped by strategical, technical and collaborative\ndevelopments. This paper is not intended to be a review, but rather to motivate\nand direct future research and collaboration across typically distinct fields\nbased on \\textit{community driven input}, to encourage further progress in our\nunderstanding of circumstellar and protoplanetary discs.\n", "  KIC 8462852 is a superficially ordinary main sequence F star for which Kepler\ndetected an unusual series of brief dimming events. We obtain accurate relative\nphotometry of KIC 8462852 from the Kepler full frame images, finding that the\nbrightness of KIC 8462852 monotonically decreased over the four years it was\nobserved by Kepler. Over the first ~1000 days, KIC 8462852 faded approximately\nlinearly at a rate of 0.341 +/- 0.041%/yr, for a total decline of 0.9%. KIC\n8462852 then dimmed much more rapidly in the next ~200 days, with its flux\ndropping by more than 2%. For the final ~200 days of Kepler photometry the\nmagnitude remained approximately constant, although the data are also\nconsistent with the decline rate measured for the first 2.7 yr. Of a sample of\n193 nearby comparison stars and 355 stars with similar stellar parameters, none\nexhibit the rapid decline by 2% or the cumulative fading by 3% of KIC 8462852.\nMoreover, of these comparison stars, only one changes brightness as quickly as\nthe 0.341%/yr measured for KIC 8462852 during the first three years of the\nKepler mission. We examine whether the rapid decline could be caused by a cloud\nof transiting circumstellar material, finding while such a cloud could evade\ndetection in sub-mm observations, the transit ingress and duration cannot be\nexplained by a simple cloud model. Moreover, this model cannot account for the\nobserved longer-term dimming. No known or proposed stellar phenomena can fully\nexplain all aspects of the observed light curve.\n", "  Context. The best precision that can be achieved to estimate the location of\na stellar-like object is a topic of permanent interest in the astrometric\ncommunity.\n  Aims. We analyse bounds for the best position estimation of a stellar-like\nobject on a CCD detector array in a Bayesian setting where the position is\nunknown, but where we have access to a prior distribution. In contrast to a\nparametric setting where we estimate a parameter from observations, the\nBayesian approach estimates a random object (i.e., the position is a random\nvariable) from observations that are statistically dependent on the position.\n  Methods. We characterize the Bayesian Cramer-Rao (CR) that bounds the minimum\nmean square error (MMSE) of the best estimator of the position of a point\nsource on a linear CCD-like detector, as a function of the properties of\ndetector, the source, and the background.\n  Results. We quantify and analyse the increase in astrometric performance from\nthe use of a prior distribution of the object position, which is not available\nin the classical parametric setting. This gain is shown to be significant for\nvarious observational regimes, in particular in the case of faint objects or\nwhen the observations are taken under poor conditions. Furthermore, we present\nnumerical evidence that the MMSE estimator of this problem tightly achieves the\nBayesian CR bound. This is a remarkable result, demonstrating that all the\nperformance gains presented in our analysis can be achieved with the MMSE\nestimator.\n  Conclusions The Bayesian CR bound can be used as a benchmark indicator of the\nexpected maximum positional precision of a set of astrometric measurements in\nwhich prior information can be incorporated. This bound can be achieved through\nthe conditional mean estimator, in contrast to the parametric case where no\nunbiased estimator precisely reaches the CR bound.\n", "  We prove dynamical and spectral localization at all energies for the discrete\ngeneralized Anderson model via the Kunz-Souillard approach to localization.\nThis is an extension of the original Kunz-Souillard approach to localization\nfor Schr\\\"odinger operators, to the case where a single random variable\ndetermines the potential on a block of an arbitrary, but fixed, size $\\alpha$.\nFor this model, we also give a description of the almost sure spectrum as a set\nand prove uniform positivity of the Lyapunov exponents. In fact, regarding\npositivity of the Lyapunov exponents, we prove a stronger statement where we\nalso allow finitely supported distributions. We also show that for any size\n$\\alpha$ {\\it generalized Anderson model}, there exists some finitely supported\ndistribution $\\nu$ for which the Lyapunov exponent will vanish for at least one\nenergy. Moreover, restricting to the special case $\\alpha=1$, we describe a\npleasant consequence of this modified technique to the original Kunz-Souillard\napproach to localization. In particular, we demonstrate that actually the\nsingle operator $T_1$ is a strict contraction in $L^2(\\mathbb{R})$, whereas\nbefore it was only shown that the second iterate of $T_1$ is a strict\ncontraction.\n", "  Using data obtained by the high resolution CRisp Imaging SpectroPolarimeter\ninstrument on the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope, we investigate the dynamics and\nstability of quiet-Sun chromospheric jets observed at disk center. Small-scale\nfeatures, such as Rapid Redshifted and Blueshifted Excursions, appearing as\nhigh speed jets in the wings of the H$\\alpha$ line, are characterized by short\nlifetimes and rapid fading without any descending behavior. To study the\ntheoretical aspects of their stability without considering their formation\nmechanism, we model chromospheric jets as twisted magnetic flux tubes moving\nalong their axis, and use the ideal linear incompressible magnetohydrodynamic\napproximation to derive the governing dispersion equation. Analytical solutions\nof the dispersion equation indicate that this type of jet is unstable to\nKelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI), with a very short (few seconds) instability\ngrowth time at high upflow speeds. The generated vortices and unresolved\nturbulent flows associated with the KHI could be observed as broadening of\nchromospheric spectral lines. Analysis of the H$\\alpha$ line profiles shows\nthat the detected structures have enhanced line widths with respect to the\nbackground. We also investigate the stability of a larger scale H$\\alpha$ jet\nthat was ejected along the line-of-sight. Vortex-like features, rapidly\ndeveloping around the jet's boundary, are considered as evidence of the KHI.\nThe analysis of the energy equation in the partially ionized plasma shows that\nthe ion-neutral collisions may lead to the fast heating of the KH vortices over\ntimescales comparable to the lifetime of chromospheric jets.\n", "  We observed the J=9-8 and 10-9 rotational lines of three13C isotopologues of\nHC3N in L1527 and G28.28-0.36 with the 45-m radio telescope of the Nobeyama\nRadio Observatory in order to constrain the main formation mechanisms of HC3N\nin each source. The abundance ratios of the three 13C isotopologues of HC3N are\nfound to be 0.9 (0.2) : 1.00 : 1.29 (0.19) (1sigma) and 1.0 (0.2) : 1.00 : 1.47\n(0.17) (1sigma) for [H13CCCN]: [HC13CCN]: [HCC13CN] in L1527 and G28.28-0.36,\nrespectively. We recognize a similar 13C isotopic fractionation pattern that\nthe abundances of H13CCCN and HC13CCN are comparable, and HCC13CN is more\nabundant than the others. Based on the results, we discuss the main formation\npathway of HC3N. The 13C isotopic fractionation pattern derived from our\nobservations can be explained by the neutral-neutral reaction between C2H2 and\nCN in both the low-mass (L1527) and high-mass (28.28-0.36) star forming\nregions.\n", "  I report discovery of a new galaxy-scale gravitational lens system,\nidentified using public data from the MaNGA survey, as part of a systematic\nsearch for lensed background line-emitters. The lens is SDSS\nJ170124.01+372258.0, a giant elliptical galaxy with velocity dispersion\n$\\sigma=256$ km/s, at a redshift of $z_l=0.122$. After modelling and\nsubtracting the target galaxy light, the integral-field data-cube reveals\n[OII], [OIII] and H$\\beta$ emission lines corresponding to a source at\n$z_s=0.791$, forming an identifiable ring around the galaxy center. The\nEinstein radius is $R_{Ein} \\approx 2.3$ arcsec, projecting to ~5 kpc at the\ndistance of the lens. The total projected lensing mass is $(3.6\\pm0.6) \\times\n10^{11} M_\\odot$, and the total J-band mass-to-light ratio is $3.0\\pm0.7$ solar\nunits. Plausible estimates of the likely dark matter content could reconcile\nthis with a Milky-Way-like initial mass function (for which M/L~1.5 is\nexpected), but heavier IMFs are by no means excluded with the present data. An\nalternative interpretation of the system, with a more complex source plane, is\nalso discussed. The discovery of this system bodes well for future lens\nsearches based on MaNGA and other integral-field spectroscopic surveys.\n", "  The Circum-Galactic Medium of MASsive Spirals (CGM-MASS) is a project\nstudying the overall content, physical and chemical properties, and spatial\ndistributions of the multi-phase circum-galactic medium (CGM) around a small\nsample of the most massive isolated spiral galaxies in the local Universe. We\nintroduce the sample and present a detailed case study of the XMM-Newton\nobservation of the hot gas halo of NGC5908. After data calibration, point\nsource removal, and background analysis, we find that the diffuse soft X-ray\nemission of NGC5908 is significantly more extended than the stellar light in\nthe vertical direction. The 0.5-1.25keV radial intensity profile tracing hot\ngas emission can be detected above the background out to about $2^\\prime$, or\n$30\\rm~kpc$ from the nucleus. The unresolved soft X-ray emission can be\ncharacterized with a $\\beta$-model with a slope of $\\beta\\approx0.68$. The\nunresolved 0.5-2keV luminosity within $1^\\prime$ is\n$6.8\\times10^{39}\\rm~ergs~s^{-1}$, but young stellar sources may contribute\nsignificantly to it. Assuming a metallicity of 0.2solar, an upper limit\n(without subtracting the very uncertain young stellar contribution) to the mass\nof hot gas within this radius is $2.3\\times10^9\\rm~M_\\odot$. The cooling radius\nis $r_{\\rm cool}\\approx25\\rm~kpc$ or $\\approx0.06r_{\\rm 200}$, within which the\nhot gas could cool radiatively in less than 10Gyr, and the cooling of hot gas\ncould significantly contribute in replenishing the gas consumed in star\nformation. The hot gas accounts for $\\approx1.9\\%$ of the baryon detected\nwithin the cooling radius. By comparing NGC5908 to other galaxies, we find that\nits X-ray luminosity per stellar mass is consistent with lower-mass\nnon-starburst field spiral galaxies. However, a large scatter in hot gas soft\nX-ray emissivity is indicated for spiral galaxies with\n$M_*\\gtrsim2\\times10^{11}\\rm~M_\\odot$.\n", "  We study features of the thermoelectric transport through a Kitaev chain\nhosting Majorana bound states (MBS) at its ends. We describe the behavior of\nthe Seebeck coefficient and the ZT figure of merit for two different\nconfigurations between MBS and normal current leads. We find an important\nviolation of the Wiedemann-Franz law in one of these geometries, leading to\nsizeable values of the thermoelectric efficiency over a narrow window in\nchemical potential away from neutrality. These findings could lead to\ninteresting thermoelectric-based MBSs detection devices, via measurements of\nthe Seebeck coefficient and figure of merit.\n", "  We present the quasi-periodic slipping motion of flux rope structures prior\nto the onset of an eruptive X-class flare on 2015 March 11, obtained by the\n\\emph{Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph} (\\emph{IRIS}) and the \\emph{Solar\nDynamics Observatory} (\\emph{SDO}). The slipping motion occurred at the north\npart of the flux rope and seemed to successively peel off the flux rope. The\nspeed of the slippage was 30$-$40 km s$^{-1}$, with an average period of\n130$\\pm$30 s. The Si {\\sc iv} 1402.77 {\\AA} line showed a redshift of 10$-$30\nkm s$^{-1}$ and a line width of 50$-$120 km s$^{-1}$ at the west legs of\nslipping structures, indicative of reconnection downflow. The slipping motion\nlasted about 40 min and the flux rope started to rise up slowly at the late\nstage of the slippage. Then an X2.1 flare was initiated and the flux rope was\nimpulsively accelerated. One of the flare ribbons swept across a\nnegative-polarity sunspot and the penumbral segments of the sunspot decayed\nrapidly after the flare. We studied the magnetic topology at the flaring region\nand the results showed the existence of a twisted flux rope, together with\nquasi-separatrix layers (QSLs) structures binding the flux rope. Our\nobservations imply that quasi-periodic slipping magnetic reconnection occurs\nalong the flux-rope-related QSLs in the preflare stage, which drives the later\neruption of the flux rope and the associated flare.\n", "  Strong spectral lines are useful indicators of stellar chromospheric\nactivity. They are physically linked to the convection efficiency, differential\nrotation, and angular momentum evolution and are a potential indicator of age.\nHowever, for ages > 2 Gyr, the age-activity relationship remains poorly\nconstrained thus hampering its full application. The Ca II infrared triplet\n(IRT lines) has been poorly studied compared to classical chromospheric\nindicators. We report in this paper absolute chromospheric fluxes in the three\nCa II IRT lines, based on a new calibration tied to up-to-date model\natmospheres. We obtain the Ca II IRT absolute fluxes for 113 FGK stars from\nhigh signal-to-noise ratio and high-resolution spectra covering an extensive\ndomain of chromospheric activity levels. We perform an absolute continuum flux\ncalibration for the Ca II IRT lines anchored in atmospheric models calculated\nas an explicit function of effective temperatures, metallicity, and gravities\navoiding the degeneracy present in photometric continuum calibrations based\nsolely on color indices. The internal uncertainties achieved for continuum\nabsolute flux calculations are 2\\% of the solar chromospheric flux, one order\nof magnitude lower than photometric calibrations. We gauge the impact of\nobservational errors on the final chromospheric fluxes due to the absolute\ncontinuum flux calibration and find that $T_{\\rm eff}$ uncertainties are\nproperly mitigated by the photospheric correction leaving [Fe/H] as the\ndominating factor in the chromospheric flux uncertainty. Across the FGK\nspectral types, the Ca II IRT lines are sensitive to chromospheric activity.\nThe reduced internal uncertainties reported here enable us to build a new\nchromospheric absolute flux scale and explore the age-activity relation from\nthe active regime down to very low activity levels and a wide range of $T_{\\rm\neff}$, mass, [Fe/H], and age.\n", "  We study the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) variability (rest frame wavelengths\n500 - 920 $\\AA$) of high luminosity quasars using HST (low to intermediate\nredshift sample) and SDSS (high redshift sample) archives. The combined HST and\nSDSS data indicates a much more pronounced variability when the sampling time\nbetween observations in the quasar rest frame is $> 2\\times 10^{7}$ sec\ncompared to $< 1.5\\times 10^{7}$ sec. Based on an excess variance analysis, for\ntime intervals $< 2\\times 10^{7}$ sec in the quasar rest frame, $10\\%$ of the\nquasars (4/40) show evidence of EUV variability. Similarly, for time intervals\n$>2\\times 10^{7}$ sec in the quasar rest frame, $55\\%$ of the quasars (21/38)\nshow evidence of EUV variability. The propensity for variability does not show\nany statistically significant change between $2.5\\times 10^{7}$ sec and\n$3.16\\times 10^{7}$ sec (1 yr). The temporal behavior is one of a threshold\ntime interval for significant variability as opposed to a gradual increase on\nthese time scales. A threshold time scale can indicate a characteristic spatial\ndimension of the EUV region. We explore this concept in the context of the slim\ndisk models of accretion. We find that for rapidly spinning black holes, the\nradial infall time to the plunge region of the optically thin surface layer of\nthe slim disk that is responsible for the preponderance of the EUV flux\nemission (primarily within 0 - 7 black hole radii from the inner edge of the\ndisk) is consistent with the empirically determined variability time scale.\n", "  We describe our second installment of the 4.75 GHz survey of ultracool dwarfs\n(UCDs) conducted with the Arecibo radio telescope, which has observed 27 such\nobjects and resulted in the detection of sporadic flaring from the T6 dwarf,\nWISEPC J112254.73+255021.5. We also present follow up observations of the first\nradio-emitting T dwarf, 2MASS J10475385+2124234, a tentatively identified radio\nemitting L1 dwarf, 2MASS J1439284+192915, and the known radio-flaring source,\n2MASS J13142039+132011 AB. Our new data indicate that 2MASS J1439284+192915 is\nnot a radio flaring source. The overall detection rate of our unbiased survey\nfor radio-flaring UCDs is ~5% for new sources, with a detection rate for each\nspectral class of ~5-10%. Evidently, radio luminosity of the UCDs does not\nappear to monotonically decline with spectral type from M7 dwarfs to giant\nplanets, in contradiction to theories of the magnetic field generation and\ninternal structure of these objects. Along with other, recently published\nresults, our data exemplify the unique value of using radio surveys to reveal\nand study properties of substellar magnetic activity.\n", "  Radial velocity searches for exoplanets have detected many multi-planet\nsystems around nearby bright stars. An advantage of this technique is that it\ngenerally samples the orbit outside of inferior/superior conjunction,\npotentially allowing the Keplerian elements of eccentricity and argument of\nperiastron to be well characterized. The orbital architectures for some of\nthese systems show signs of close planetary encounters that may render the\nsystems unstable as described. We provide an in-depth analysis of two such\nsystems: HD 5319 and HD 7924, for which the scenario of coplanar orbits results\nin rapid destabilization of the systems. The poorly constrained periastron\narguments of the outer planets in these systems further emphasizes the need for\ndetailed investigations. An exhaustive scan of parameters space via dynamical\nsimulations reveals specific mutual inclinations between the two outer planets\nin each system that allow for stable configurations over long timescales. We\ncompare these configurations with those presented by mean-motion resonance as\npossible stability sources. Finally, we discuss the relevance to interpretation\nof multi-planet Keplerian orbits and suggest additional observations that will\nhelp to resolve the system stabilities.\n", "  One of the great challenges in understanding stars is measuring their masses.\nThe best methods for measuring stellar masses include binary interaction,\nasteroseismology and stellar evolution models, but these methods are not ideal\nfor red giant and supergiant stars. In this work, we propose a novel method for\ninferring stellar masses of evolved red giant and supergiant stars using\ninterferometric and spectrophotometric observations combined with spherical\nmodel stellar atmospheres to measure what we call the stellar mass index,\ndefined as the ratio between the stellar radius and mass. The method is based\non the correlation between different measurements of angular diameter, used as\na proxy for atmospheric extension, and fundamental stellar parameters. For a\ngiven star, spectrophotometry measures the Rosseland angular diameter while\ninterferometric observations generally probe a larger limb-darkened angular\ndiameter. The ratio of these two angular diameters is proportional to the\nrelative extension of the stellar atmosphere, which is strongly correlated to\nthe star's effective temperature, radius and mass. We show that these\ncorrelations are strong and can lead to precise measurements of stellar masses.\n", "  We study laser-induced torques in bcc Fe, hcp Co and $L1_0$ FePt based on\nfirst-principles electronic structure calculations and the Keldysh\nnonequilibrium formalism. We find that the torques have two contributions, one\nfrom the inverse Faraday effect (IFE) and one from the optical spin-transfer\ntorque (OSTT). Depending on the ferromagnet at hand and on the quasiparticle\nbroadening the two contributions may be of similar magnitude or one\ncontribution may dominate over the other. Additionally, we determine the\nnonequilibrium spin polarization in order to investigate its relation to the\ntorque. We find the torques and the perpendicular component of the\nnonequilibrium spin polarization to be odd in the helicity of the laser light,\nwhile the spin polarization that is induced parallel to the magnetization is\nhelicity-independent. The parallel component of the nonequilibrium spin\npolarization is orders of magnitude larger than the perpendicular component. In\nthe case of hcp Co we find good agreement between the calculated laser-induced\ntorque and a recent experiment.\n", "  One of the results of the Milky Way Star Clusters (MWSC) survey by Kharchenko\net al. (2013) was the detection of a slight under-density of old (ca. 1 Gyr)\nclusters within the nearest kilo-parsec from the Sun. This under-density may be\ndue to an ineffectiveness in the detection of larger structures with lower\nsurface brightness. We report on our attempts to reveal such clusters. We\nderived proper motions from a combination of Tycho-2 with URAT1, and obtained a\nmean precision of about 1.4 mas/y per co-ordinate for 1.3 million stars north\nof -20 degree declination. We cut the sky into narrow proper motion slices and\nsearched for spatial over-densities of stars in each slice. In optical and\nnear-infrared colour-magnitude diagrams stars from over-densities were than\nexamined to determine if they are compatible with isochrones of a cluster. We\nestimated the field star contamination using our data and the Besancon Galactic\nmodel.We detected 9 hitherto unknown open clusters in the vicinity of the Sun\nwith ages between 70 Myr and 1 Gyr, and distances between 200 and 500 pc.\n", "  The general lack of molecular oxygen in molecular clouds is an outstanding\nproblem in astrochemistry. Extensive searches with SWAS, Odin and Herschel have\nonly produced two detections; upper limits to the O_2 abundance in the\nremaining sources observed are about 1000 times lower than predicted by\nchemical models.\n  Previous atomic oxygen observations and inferences from observations of other\nmolecules indicated that high abundances of O atoms might be present in dense\ncores exhibiting large amounts of CO depletion. Theoretical arguments\nconcerning the oxygen gas-grain interaction in cold dense cores suggested that,\nif O atoms could survive in the gas after most of the rest of the heavy\nmolecular material has frozen out on to dust, then O_2 could be formed\nefficiently in the gas. Using Herschel HIFI we searched a small sample of four\ndepletion cores - L1544, L694-2, L429, Oph D - for emission in the low\nexcitation O_2 N_J=3_3-1_2 line at 487.249 GHz. Molecular oxygen was not\ndetected and we derive upper limits to its abundance in the range N(O_2)/N(H_2)\n= (0.6 - 1.6)x10^{-7}. We discuss the absence of O_2 in the light of recent\nlaboratory and observational studies.\n", "  We present a new multitrace matrix model, which is a generalization of the\nreal quartic one matrix model, exhibiting dynamical emergence of a fuzzy\ntwo-sphere and its non-commutative gauge theory. This provides a novel and a\nmuch simpler alternative to Connes non-commutative geometry and to the IKKT\nmatrix model for emergent geometry in two dimensions.\n", "  A radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF), which is commonly\ncharacterized by its sub-Keplerian nature, is a favored accretion model for the\nsupermassive black hole at Galactic center, Sagittarius A$^{*}$. To investigate\nthe observable features of a RIAF, we compare the modeled shadow images,\nvisibilities, and spectra of three flow models with dynamics characterized by\n(i) a Keplerian shell which is rigidly-rotating outside the innermost stable\ncircular orbit (ISCO) and infalling with a constant angular momentum inside\nISCO, (ii) a sub-Keplerian motion, and (iii) a free-falling motion with zero\nangular momentum at infinity. At near-mm wavelengths the emission is dominated\nby the flow within several Schwarzschild radii. The energy shift due to the\nflow dynamics becomes important and distinguishable, suggesting that the flow\ndynamics are an important model parameter for interpreting the mm/submillimeter\nvery long baseline interferometric observations with the forthcoming, fully\nassembled Event Horizon Telescope (EHT). As an example, we demonstrate that\nstructural variations of Sagittarius A$^{*}$ on event horizon-scales detected\nin previous EHT observations can be explained by the non-stationary dynamics of\na RIAF.\n", "  Diffuse star clusters (DSCs) are old and dynamically hot stellar systems that\nhave lower surface brightness and more extended morphology than globular\nclusters (GCs). Using the images from HST/ACS Fornax Cluster Survey, we find\nthat 12 out of 43 early-type galaxies (ETGs) in the Fornax cluster host\nsignificant numbers of DSCs. Together with literature data from the HST/ACS\nVirgo Cluster Survey, where 18 out of 100 ETGs were found to host DSCs, we\nsystematically study the relationship of DSCs with GCs, and their host galaxy\nenvironment. Two DSC hosts are post-merger galaxies, with most of the other\nhosts either having low mass or showing clear disk components. We find that\nwhile the number ratio of DSCs to GCs is nearly constant in massive galaxies,\nthe DSC-to-GC ratio becomes systematically higher in lower mass hosts. This\nsuggests that DSCs may be more efficient at forming (or surviving) in low\ndensity environments. DSC hosts are not special either in their position in the\ncluster, or in the galactic color-magnitude diagram. Why some disk and low-mass\ngalaxies host DSCs while others do not is still a puzzle, however. The mean\nages of DSC hosts and non-hosts are similar at similar masses, implying that\nformation efficiency, rather than survival, is the reason behind different DSC\nnumber fractions in early-type galaxies.\n", "  We present the first high spectral resolution X-ray observation of the\nbroad-line radio galaxy 3C 390.3 obtained with the high energy transmission\ngrating (HETG) spectrometer on board the Chandra X-ray Observatory. The\nspectrum shows complex emission and absorption features in both the soft X-rays\nand Fe K band. We detect emission and absorption lines in the energy range\nbetween E = 700-1000 eV associated with ionized Fe L transitions (Fe XVII-XX).\nAn emission line at the energy of E=6.4 keV consistent with the Fe K\\alpha is\nalso observed. Our best-fit model requires at least three different components:\n(i) a hot emission component likely associated with the hot interstellar medium\nin this elliptical galaxy with temperature kT=0.5+/-0.1 keV; (ii) a warm\nabsorber with ionization parameter log\\xi=2.3+/-0.5 erg s^{-1} cm, column\ndensity logN_H=20.7+/-0.1 cm^{-2}, and outflow velocity of v_{out}<150 km\ns^{-1}; (iii) a lowly ionized reflection component in the Fe K band likely\nassociated with the optical broad line region or the outer accretion disk.\nThese evidences suggest the possibility that we are looking directly down the\nionization cone of this active galaxy and that the central X-ray source only\nphotoionizes along the unobscured cone. This is overall consistent with the\nangle-dependent unified picture of active galactic nuclei.\n", "  The chemical evolution of lithium in the Milky Way represents a major problem\nin modern astrophysics. Indeed, lithium is, on the one hand, easily destroyed\nin stellar interiors, and, on the other hand, produced at some specific stellar\nevolutionary stages that are still not well constrained. The goal of this paper\nis to investigate the lithium stellar content of Milky Way stars in order to\nput constraints on the lithium chemical enrichment in our Galaxy, in particular\nin both the thin and thick discs. Thanks to high-resolution spectra from the\nESO archive and high quality atmospheric parameters, we were able to build a\nmassive and homogeneous catalogue of lithium abundances for 7300 stars derived\nwith an automatic method coupling, a synthetic spectra grid, and a Gauss-Newton\nalgorithm. We validated these lithium abundances with literature values,\nincluding those of the Gaia benchmark stars. In terms of lithium galactic\nevolution, we show that the interstellar lithium abundance increases with\nmetallicity by 1 dex from [M/H]=-1 dex to +0.0 dex. Moreover, we find that this\nlithium ISM abundance decreases by about 0.5 dex at super-solar metalllicity.\nBased on a chemical separation, we also observed that the stellar lithium\ncontent in the thick disc increases rather slightly with metallicity, while the\nthin disc shows a steeper increase. The lithium abundance distribution of\nalpha-rich, metal-rich stars has a peak at A(Li)~3 dex. We conclude that the\nthick disc stars suffered of a low lithium chemical enrichment, showing lithium\nabundances rather close to the Spite plateau while the thin disc stars clearly\nshow an increasing lithium chemical enrichment with the metallicity, probably\nthanks to the contribution of low-mass stars.\n", "  We investigate the nature of Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) subgap states induced by\nsingle Manganese (Mn) atoms adsorbed on different surface orientations of\nsuperconducting lead (Pb). Depending on the adsorption site, we detect a\ndistinct number and characteristic patterns of YSR states around the Mn atoms.\nWe suggest that the YSR states inherit their properties from the Mn $d$-levels,\nwhich are split by the surrounding crystal field. The periodicity of the\nlong-range YSR oscillations allows us to identify a dominant coupling of the\nd-states to the outer Fermi sheet of the two-band superconductor Pb.\n", "  We present a theoretical analysis of unidirectional interface states which\nform near $p$-$n$ junctions in a graphene monolayer subject to a homogeneous\nmagnetic field. The semiclassical limit of these states corresponds to\ntrajectories propagating along the $p$-$n$ interface by a combined\nskipping-snaking motion. Studying the two-dimensional Dirac equation with a\nmagnetic field and an electrostatic potential step, we provide and discuss the\nexact and essentially analytical solution of the quantum-mechanical\neigenproblem for both a straight and a circularly shaped junction. The spectrum\nconsists of localized Landau-like and unidirectional snaking-skipping interface\nstates, where we always find at least one chiral interface state. For a\nstraight junction and at energies near the Dirac point, when increasing the\npotential step height, the group velocity of this state interpolates in an\noscillatory manner between the classical drift velocity in a crossed\nelectromagnetic field and the semiclassical value expected for a purely snaking\nmotion. Away from the Dirac point, chiral interface states instead resemble the\nconventional skipping (edge-type) motion found also in the corresponding\nSchr\\\"odinger case. We also investigate the circular geometry, where chiral\ninterface states are predicted to induce sizeable equilibrium ring currents.\n", "  Tensor eigenvalues and eigenvectors have been introduced in the recent\nmathematical literature as a generalization of the usual matrix eigenvalues and\neigenvectors. We apply this formalism to a tensor that describes a multipartite\nsymmetric state or a spin state, and we investigate to what extent the\ncorresponding tensor eigenvalues contain information about the multipartite\nentanglement (or, equivalently, the classicality) of the state. This extends\nprevious results connecting entanglement to spectral properties related to the\nstate. While for spin-1 states the positivity of the smallest tensor eigenvalue\nis equivalent to separability, we show that for higher values of the angular\nmomentum there is a correlation between entanglement and the value of the\nsmallest tensor eigenvalue.\n", "  {The aim of this work is to investigate the relations between the abundances\nof different elements in the globular cluster M4, selected for its uniform\ndeficiency of iron, to explore the best models explaining the pattern of these\nobserved abundances. Moreover, in turnoff stars, the abundances of the elements\nare not suspected to be affected by internal mixing. In M4, using low and\nmoderate resolution spectra obtained for 91 turnoff (and subgiant) stars with\nthe ESO FLAMES-Giraffe spectrograph, we have extended previous measurements of\nabundances (of Li, C and Na) to other elements (C, Si, Ca, Sr and Ba), using\nmodel atmosphere analysis. We have also studied the influence of the choice of\nthe microturbulent velocity. Firstly, the peculiar turnoff star found to be\nvery Li-rich in a previous paper does not show any other abundance anomalies\nrelative to the other turnoff stars in M4. ~Secondly, an anti-correlation\nbetween C and Na has been detected, the slope being significative at more than\n$3\\sigma$. This relation between C and Na is in perfect agreement with the\nrelation found in giant stars selected below the RGB bump. ~Thirdly, the strong\nenrichment of Si and of the neutron-capture elements Sr and Ba, already\nobserved in the giants in M4, is confirmed. ~Finally, the relations between Li,\nC, Na, Sr and Ba constrain the enrichment processes of the observed stars. The\nabundances of the elements in the turnoff stars appear to be compatible with\nproduction processes by massive AGBs, but are also compatible with the\nproduction of second generation elements (like Na) and low Li produced by, for\nexample, fast rotating massive stars.\n", "  Transitional discs are a class of circumstellar discs around young stars with\nextensive clearing of dusty material within their inner regions on 10s of au\nscales. One of the primary candidates for this kind of clearing is the\nformation of planet(s) within the disc that then accrete or clear their\nimmediate area as they migrate through the disc.\n  Our sample included eight transitional discs. Using the Keck/NIRC2 instrument\nwe utilised the Sparse Aperture Masking (SAM) interferometry technique to\nsearch for asymmetries indicative of ongoing planet formation. We searched for\nclose-in companions using both model fitting and interferometric image\nreconstruction techniques. Using simulated data, we derived diagnostics that\nhelped us to distinguish between point sources and extended asymmetric disc\nemission. In addition, we investigated the degeneracy between the contrast and\nseparation that appear for marginally resolved companions.\n  We found FP Tau to contain a previously unseen disc wall, and DM Tau, LkHa\n330, and TW Hya to contain an asymmetric signal indicative of point source-like\nemission.\n  We placed upper limits on the contrast of a companion in RXJ1842.9-3532 and\nV2246 Oph. We ruled the asymmetry signal in RXJ1615.3-3255 and V2062 Oph to be\nfalse positives.\n  In the cases where our data indicated a potential companion we computed\nestimates for the value of $M_c \\dot M_c$ and found values in the range of\n$10^{-5} - 10^{-3} M^2_J yr^{-1}$.\n  We found significant asymmetries in four targets. Of these, three were\nconsistent with companions. We resolved a previously unseen gap in the disc of\nFP Tau extending inwards from approximately 10 au.\n", "  We present the measurements of the luminosity-dependent redshift-space\nthree-point correlation functions (3PCFs) for the Sloan Digital Sky Survey\n(SDSS) DR7 Main galaxy sample. We compare the 3PCF measurements to the\npredictions from three different halo and subhalo models. One is the halo\noccupation distribution (HOD) model and the other two are extensions of the\nsubhalo abundance matching (SHAM) model by allowing the central and satellite\ngalaxies to have different occupation distributions in the host halos and\nsubhalos. Parameters in all the models are chosen to best describe the\nprojected and redshift-space two-point correlation functions (2PCFs) of the\nsame set of galaxies. All three model predictions agree well with the 3PCF\nmeasurements for the most luminous galaxy sample, while the HOD model better\nperforms in matching the 3PCFs of fainter samples (with luminosity threshold\nbelow $L^*$), which is similar in trend to the case of fitting the 2PCFs. The\ndecomposition of the model 3PCFs into contributions from different types of\ngalaxy triplets shows that on small scales the dependence of the 3PCFs on\ntriangle shape is driven by nonlinear redshift-space distortion (and not by the\nintrinsic halo shape) while on large scales it reflects the filamentary\nstructure. The decomposition also reveals more detailed differences in the\nthree models, which are related to the radial distribution, the mean occupation\nfunction, and the velocity distribution of satellite galaxies inside halos. The\nresults suggest that galaxy 3PCFs can further help constrain the above\ngalaxy-halo relation and test theoretical models.\n", "  We present a new framework were we simultaneously fit strong lensing (SL) and\ndynamical data. The SL analysis is based on LENSTOOL, and the dynamical\nanalysis uses MAMPOSSt code, which we have integrated into LENSTOOL. After\ndescribing the implementation of this new tool, we apply it on the galaxy group\nSL2S\\,J02140-0535 ($z_{\\rm spec}=0.44$), which we have already studied in the\npast. We use new VLT/FORS2 spectroscopy of multiple images and group members,\nas well as shallow X-ray data from \\xmm. We confirm that the observed lensing\nfeatures in SL2S\\,J02140-0535 belong to different background sources. One of\nthis sources is located at $z_{\\rm spec}$ = 1.017 $\\pm$ 0.001, whereas the\nother source is located at $z_{\\rm spec}$ = 1.628 $\\pm$ 0.001. With the\nanalysis of our new and our previously reported spectroscopic data, we find 24\nsecure members for SL2S\\,J02140-0535. Both data sets are well reproduced by a\nsingle NFW mass profile: the dark matter halo coincides with the peak of the\nlight distribution, with scale radius, concentration, and mass equal to $r_s$\n=$82^{+44}_{-17}$ kpc , $c_{200}$ = $10.0^{+1.7}_{-2.5}$, and $M_{200}$ =\n$1.0^{+0.5}_{-0.2}$ $\\times$ 10$^{14}$M$_{\\odot}$ respectively. These\nparameters are better constrained when we fit simultaneously SL and dynamical\ninformation. The mass contours of our best model agrees with the direction\ndefined by the luminosity contours and the X-ray emission of SL2S\\,J02140-0535.\nThe simultaneous fit lowers the error in the mass estimate by 0.34 dex, when\ncompared to the SL model, and in 0.15 dex when compared to the dynamical\nmethod.The combination of SL and dynamics tools yields a more accurate probe of\nthe mass profile of SL2S\\,J02140-0535 up to $r_{200}$. However, there is\ntension between the best elliptical SL model and the best spherical dynamical\nmodel.\n", "  We present eight monitoring seasons of the four brightest images of the\ngravitational lens SDSS J1004+4112 observed between December 2003 and October\n2010. Using measured time delays for the images A, B and C and the model\npredicted time delay for image D we have removed the intrinsic quasar\nvariability, finding microlensing events of about 0.5 and 0.7 mag of amplitude\nin the images C and D. From the statistics of microlensing amplitudes in images\nA, C, and D, we have inferred the half-light radius (at {\\lambda} rest = 2407\n{\\AA}) for the accretion disk using two different methods,\n$R_{1/2}=8.7^{+18.5}_{-5.5} \\sqrt{M/0.3 M_\\odot}$ (histograms product) and\n$R_{1/2} = 4.2^{+3.2}_{-2.2} \\sqrt{M/0.3 M_\\odot}$ light-days ($\\chi^2$). The\nresults are in agreement within uncertainties with the size predicted from the\nblack hole mass in SDSS J1004+4112 using the thin disk theory.\n", "  We present the results of a recent reverberation mapping campaign for UGC\n06728, a nearby low-luminosity Seyfert 1 in a late-type galaxy. Nightly\nmonitoring in the spring of 2015 allowed us to determine an H$\\beta$ time delay\nof $\\tau = 1.4 \\pm 0.8$ days. Combined with the width of the variable H$\\beta$\nline profile, we determine a black hole mass of $M_{\\rm BH} = (7.1 \\pm 4.0)\n\\times 10^5$ M$_{\\odot}$. We also constrain the bulge stellar velocity\ndispersion from higher-resolution long slit spectroscopy along the galaxy minor\naxis and find $\\sigma_{\\star} = 51.6 \\pm 4.9$ km s$^{-1}$. The measurements\npresented here are in good agreement with both the $R_{\\rm BLR} - L$\nrelationship and the $M_{\\rm BH}-\\sigma_{\\star}$ relationship for AGNs.\nCombined with a previously published spin measurement, our mass determination\nfor UGC 06728 makes it the lowest-mass black hole that has been fully\ncharacterized, and thus an important object to help anchor the low-mass end of\nblack hole evolutionary models.\n", "  The Kondo insulator SmB$_6$ has long been known to display anomalous\ntransport behavior at low temperatures, T$<5$ K. In this temperatures range, a\nplateau is observed in the dc resistivity, contrary to the exponential\ndivergence expected for a gapped system. Recent theoretical calculations\nsuggest that SmB$_6$ may be the first topological Kondo insulator (TKI) and\npropose that the residual conductivity is due to topological surface states\nwhich reside within the Kondo gap. Since the TKI prediction many experiments\nhave claimed to observe high mobility surface states within a perfectly\ninsulating hybridization gap. Here, we investigate the low energy optical\nconductivity within the hybridization gap of single crystals of SmB$_6$ via\ntime domain terahertz spectroscopy. Samples grown by both optical floating zone\nand aluminum flux methods are investigated to probe for differences originating\nfrom sample growth techniques. We find that both samples display significant 3D\nbulk conduction originating within the Kondo gap. Although SmB$_6$ may be a\nbulk dc insulator, it shows significant bulk ac conduction that is many orders\nof magnitude larger than any known impurity band conduction. The nature of\nthese in-gap states and their coupling with the low energy spin excitons of\nSmB$_6$ is discussed. Additionally, the well defined conduction path geometry\nof our optical experiments allows us to show that any surface states, which lie\nbelow our detection threshold if present, must have a sheet resistance of\nR$/\\square \\ge$ 1000 $\\Omega$.\n", "  We present the X-ray spectral analysis of the 1855 extragalactic sources in\nthe Chandra COSMOS-Legacy survey catalog having more than 30 net counts in the\n0.5-7 keV band. 38% of the sources are optically classified Type 1 active\ngalactic nuclei (AGN), 60% are Type 2 AGN and 2% are passive, low-redshift\ngalaxies. We study the distribution of AGN photon index and of the intrinsic\nabsorption N(H,z) based on the sources optical classification: Type 1 have a\nslightly steeper mean photon index than Type 2 AGN, which on the other hand\nhave average intrinsic absorption ~3 times higher than Type 1 AGN. We find that\n~15% of Type 1 AGN have N(H,z)>1E22 cm^(-2), i.e., are obscured according to\nthe X-ray spectral fitting; the vast majority of these sources have\nL(2-10keV)>$1E44 erg/s. The existence of these objects suggests that optical\nand X-ray obscuration can be caused by different phenomena, the X-ray\nobscuration being for example caused by dust-free material surrounding the\ninner part of the nuclei. ~18% of Type 2 AGN have N(H,z)<1E22 cm^(-2), and most\nof these sources have low X-ray luminosities (L(2-10keV)<$1E43 erg/s). We\nexpect a part of these sources to be low-accretion, unobscured AGN lacking of\nbroad emission lines. Finally, we also find a direct proportional trend between\nN(H,z) and host galaxy mass and star formation rate, although part of this\ntrend is due to a redshift selection effect.\n", "  Recently introduced speckle-correlations based techniques enable noninvasive\nimaging of objects hidden behind scattering layers. In these techniques the\nhidden object Fourier amplitude is retrieved from the scattered light\nautocorrelation, and the lost Fourier phase is recovered via iterative\nphase-retrieval algorithms, which suffer from convergence to wrong local-minima\nsolutions and cannot solve ambiguities in object-orientation. Here, inspired by\nnotions used in astronomy, we experimentally demonstrate that in addition to\nFourier amplitude, the object phase information is naturally and inherently\nencoded in scattered light bispectrum (the Fourier transform of\ntriple-correlation), and can also be extracted from a single high-resolution\nspeckle pattern, based on which we present a single-shot imaging scheme to\ndeterministically and unambiguously retrieve diffraction-limited images of\nobjects hidden behind scattering layers.\n", "  The local Galactic HI gas was found to contain cold neutral medium (CNM)\nfilaments that are aligned with polarized dust emission. These filaments appear\nto be dominated by the magnetic field and in this case turbulence is expected\nto show distinct anisotropies. We use the Galactic Effelsberg--Bonn HI Survey\n(EBHIS) to derive 2D turbulence spectra for the HI distribution in direction to\n3C196 and two more comparison fields. Prior to Fourier transform we apply a\nrotational symmetric 50% Tukey window to apodize the data. We derive average as\nwell as position angle dependent power spectra. Anisotropies in the power\ndistribution are defined as the ratio of the spectral power in orthogonal\ndirections. We find strong anisotropies. For a narrow range in position angle,\nin direction perpendicular to the filaments and the magnetic field, the\nspectral power is on average more than an order of magnitude larger than\nparallel. In the most extreme case the anisotropy reaches locally a factor of\n130. Anisotropies increase on average with spatial frequency as predicted by\nGoldreich and Sridhar, at the same time the Kolmogorov spectral index remains\nalmost unchanged. The strongest anisotropies are observable for a narrow range\nin velocity and decay with a power law index close to --8/3, almost identical\nto the average isotropic spectral index of $-2.9 < \\gamma < -2.6$. HI\nfilaments, associated with linear polarization structures in LOFAR observations\nin direction to 3C196, show turbulence spectra with marked anisotropies.\nDecaying anisotropies appear to indicate that we witness an ongoing shock\npassing the HI and affecting the observed Faraday depth.\n", "  We present a new HI modelling tool called \\textsc{Galactus}. The program has\nbeen designed to perform automated fits of disc-galaxy models to observations.\nIt includes a treatment for the self-absorption of the gas. The software has\nbeen released into the public domain. We describe the design philosophy and\ninner workings of the program. After this, we model the face-on galaxy NGC2403,\nusing both self-absorption and optically thin models, showing that\nself-absorption occurs even in face-on galaxies. It is shown that the maximum\nsurface brightness plateaus seen in Paper I of this series are indeed signs of\nself-absorption. The apparent HI mass of an edge-on galaxy can be drastically\nlower compared to that same galaxy seen face-on. The Tully-Fisher relation is\nfound to be relatively free from self-absorption issues.\n", "  We present a new strategy for fitting the structure and kinematics of the HI\nin edge-on galaxies using a fit to the terminal-velocity channel maps of a HI\ndata cube. The strategy can deal with self-absorbing HI gas and the presence of\nwarps. The method is first tested on a series of models. We demonstrate that\nfitting optically thin models to real galaxies will lead to an overestimation\nof the thickness and velocity dispersion, and to a serious underestimation of\nthe HI face-on column densities. We subsequently fit both self-absorption and\noptically thin models to the HI data of six edge-on galaxies. In three of these\nwe have also measured the velocity dispersion. On average 27 \\pm 6 % of the\ntotal HI mass of edge-on galaxies is hidden by self-absorption. This implies\nthat the HI mass, thickness and velocity dispersion of galaxies is typically\nunderestimated in the literature.\n", "  We present optical and near-infrared archival observations of eight edge-on\ngalaxies. These observations are used to model the stellar content of each\ngalaxy using the FitSKIRT software package. Using FitSKIRT, we can\nself-consistently model a galaxy in each band simultaneously while treating for\ndust. This allows us to accurately measure both the scale length and scale\nheight of the stellar disc, plus the shape parameters of the bulge. By\ncombining this data with the previously reported integrated magnitudes of each\ngalaxy, we can infer their true luminosities. We have successfully modelled\nseven out of the eight galaxies in our sample. We find that stellar discs can\nbe modelled correctly, but have not been able to model the stellar bulge\nreliably. Our sample consists for the most part of slow rotating galaxies, and\nwe find that the average dust layer is much thicker than what is reported for\nfaster rotating galaxies.\n", "  We study the compatibility of measurements on finite-dimensional compact\nconvex state space in the framework of general probabilistic theory. Our main\nemphasis is on formulation of necessary and sufficient conditions for\ntwo-outcome measurements to be compatible and we use these conditions to show\nthat there exist incompatible measurements whenever the state space is not a\nsimplex. We also formulate the linear programming problem for the compatibility\nof two-outcome measurements.\n", "  How protostars accrete mass is one of the fundamental problems of star\nformation. High column densities and complex kinematical structures make direct\nobservations challenging and they only provide a snapshot. Chemical tracers\nprovide an interesting alternative to characterise the infall histories of\nprotostars. Previous observations of H13CO+ towards the low-mass protostar\nIRAS15398-3359 showed a depression in the abundance. This is a sign of\ndestruction of HCO+ by an enhanced presence of gaseous water in an extended\nregion, possibly related to a recent burst in the accretion. Direct\nobservations of water vapour can determine the exact extent of the emission and\nconfirm the hypothesis that HCO+ is indeed a good tracer of the water\nsnow-line. IRAS15398 was observed using ALMA at 0.5\" resolution. Maps of\nHDO(101-000) and H218O(414-321) were taken simultaneously with observations of\nthe CS(8-7) and N2H+(5-4) lines and continuum at 0.65 and 0.75 mm. The maps\nwere interpreted using dust radiative transfer calculations of the protostellar\ninfalling envelope with an outflow cavity. HDO is clearly detected and extended\nover the scales of the H13CO+ depression, although it is displaced by ~500 AU\nin the direction of the outflow. H218O is tentatively detected towards the\nred-shifted outflow lobe, but otherwise it is absent from the mapped region,\nwhich suggests that temperatures are low. Based on the temperature structure\nobtained from dust radiative transfer models, we conclude that the water was\nmost likely released from the grains in an extended hour-glass configuration\nduring a recent accretion burst. HDO is only detected in the region closest to\nthe protostar, at distances of up to 500 AU. These signatures can only be\nexplained if the luminosity has recently been increased by orders of\nmagnitudes. Additionally, the densities in the outflow cones must be\nsufficiently low.\n", "  CP-violating asymmetries in $B \\to \\pi \\pi$ and $B \\to \\rho \\rho$ decays can\nhelp specify the weak phase $\\phi_2 = \\alpha$ of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-%\nMaskawa (CKM) matrix. We discuss the impact of improved measurements of these\nprocesses such as will be available in the near future, finding special value\nin better measurement of the time-dependent CP violation parameter $S_{00}$ in\n$B^0 \\to \\pi^0 \\pi^0$ and $B^0 \\to \\rho^0 \\rho^0$. Reducing the errors on $B\n\\to \\rho \\rho$ measurements by a factor of two can potentially lead to an error\nin $\\phi_2 = \\alpha$ just above $2^\\circ$, at which level isospin-breaking\ncorrections must be considered.\n", "  For decades, the bright radio quasar 3C 286 has been widely recognized as one\nof the most reliable polarization calibrators at centimeter wavelengths because\nof its unchanging polarization position angle and high polarization percentage.\nHowever, it has become clear in recent years that the polarization position\nangle of 3C 286 changes with increasing frequency, increasing from\n~33$^{\\circ}$ at $\\lambda \\gtrsim 3$ cm to ~38$^{\\circ}$ at $\\lambda \\approx 1$\nmm. With the advent of high-sensitivity polarization observations by current\nand future (sub)millimeter telescopes, knowledge of the position angle of 3C\n286 at higher frequencies is critical for calibration. We report the first\npolarization observations of 3C 286 at submillimeter wavelengths, taken at 880\n$\\mu$m (340 GHz) with the Submillimeter Array. We find a polarization position\nangle and percentage of $37.4 \\pm 1.5^{\\circ}$ and $15.7 \\pm 0.8$%,\nrespectively, consistent with previous measurements at 1 mm.\n", "  Weyl semimetals are gapless three-dimensional topological materials where two\nbands touch at an even number of points in the bulk Brillouin zone. These\nsemimetals exhibit topologically protected surface Fermi arcs, which pairwise\nconnect the projected bulk band touchings in the surface Brillouin zone. Here,\nwe analyze the quasiparticle interference patterns of the Weyl phase when\ntime-reversal symmetry is explicitly broken. We use a multi-band $d$-electron\nHubbard Hamiltonian on a pyrochlore lattice, relevant for the pyrochlore\niridate R$_2$Ir$_2$O$_7$ (where R is a rare earth). Using exact\ndiagonalization, we compute the surface spectrum and quasiparticle interference\n(QPI) patterns for various surface terminations and impurities. We show that\nthe spin and orbital texture of the surface states can be inferred from the\nabsence of certain backscattering processes and from the symmetries of the QPI\nfeatures for non-magnetic and magnetic impurities. Furthermore, we show that\nthe QPI patterns of the Weyl phase in pyrochlore iridates may exhibit\nadditional interesting features that go beyond those found previously in TaAs.\n", "  Statistical characterization of secondary subsystems in binaries helps to\ndistinguish between various scenarios of multiple-star formation. The DSSI\nspeckle instrument was used at the Gemini-N telescope for several hours in 2015\nJuly to probe binarity of 25 secondary components in nearby solar-type\nbinaries. Six new subsystems were resolved, with meaningful detection limits\nfor the remaining targets. The large incidence of secondary subsystems agrees\nwith other similar studies. The newly resolved subsystem HIP 115417 Ba,Bb\ncauses deviations in the observed motion of the outer binary from which an\nastrometric orbit of Ba,Bb with a period of 117 years is deduced.\n", "  In this work we develop a compact multi-orbital tight-binding model for\nphosphorene that accurately describes states near the main band gap. The model\nparameters are adjusted using as reference the band structure obtained by a\ndensity-functional theory calculation with the hybrid HSE06 functional. We use\nthe optimized tight-binding model to study the effects of disorder on the\nanisotropic transport properties of phosphorene. In particular, we evaluate how\nthe longitudinal resistivity depends on the lattice orientation for two typical\ndisorder models: dilute scatterers with high potential fluctuation amplitudes,\nmimicking screened charges in the substrate, and dense scatterers with lower\namplitudes, simulating weakly bounded adsorbates. We show that the intrinsic\nanisotropy associated to the band structure of this material, although\nsensitive to the type and intensity of the disorder, is robust.\n", "  We study the effects that ripples induce on the electrical and magnetic\nproperties of graphene. The variation of the interatomic distance created by\nthe ripples translates in a modulation of the hopping parameter between carbon\natoms. A tight binding Hamiltonian including a Hubbard interaction term is\nsolved self consistently for ripples with different amplitudes and periods. We\nfind that, for values of the Hubbard interaction $U$ above a critical value\n$U_C$, the system displays a superposition of local ferromagnetic and\nantiferromagnetic ordered states. Nonetheless the global ferromagnetic order\nparameter is zero. The $U_C$ depends only on the product of the period and\nhopping amplitude modulation. When the Hubbard interaction is close to the\ncritical value of the antiferromagnetic transition in pristine graphene, the\nantiferromagnetic order parameter becomes much larger than the ferromagnetic\none, being the ground state similar to that of flat graphene.\n", "  The variational approach to QCD in Coulomb gauge is revisited. By assuming\nthe non-Abelian Coulomb potential to be given by the sum of its infrared and\nultraviolet parts, i.e.~by a linearly rising potential and an ordinary Coulomb\npotential, and by using a Slater determinant ansatz for the quark wave\nfunctional, which contains the coupling of the quarks and the gluons with two\ndifferent Dirac structures, we obtain variational equations for the kernels of\nthe fermionic vacuum wave functional, which are free of ultraviolet\ndivergences. Thereby, a Gaussian type wave functional is assumed for the\ngluonic part of the vacuum. By using the results of the pure Yang--Mills sector\nfor the gluon propagator as input, we solve the equations for the fermionic\nkernels numerically and calculate the quark condensate and the effective quark\nmass in leading order. Assuming a value of $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{C}} = 2.5 \\sigma$\nfor the Coulomb string tension (where $\\sigma$ is the usual Wilsonian string\ntension) the phenomenological value of the quark condensate $\\langle \\bar{\\psi}\n\\psi \\rangle \\simeq (-235 \\, \\mathrm{MeV})^3$ is reproduced with a value of $g\n\\simeq 2.1$ for the strong coupling constant of the quark-gluon vertex.\n", "  The Planck length and Planck energy should be taken as invariant scales are\nin agreement with various theories of quantum gravity. In this scenario, the\noriginal general relativity can be changed to the so-called gravity's rainbow\nwhich produces significant modifications to the black holes' evolution. In this\npaper, using two kinds of rainbow functions, we investigate the thermodynamics\nand the phase transition of Schwarzschild black hole in the context of\ngravity's rainbow theory. Firstly, with the help of the Heisenberg uncertainty\nprinciple, we calculate the modified Hawking temperature. Then, based on this\nmodification, we derive the local temperature, free energy and other\nthermodynamic quantities in an isothermal cavity. Finally, the critical\nbehavior, the thermodynamic stability and phase transition of the rainbow\nSchwarzschild black hole are analyzed. It turns out that our results are\ndifferent from the those of Hawking-Page phase transition. Meanwhile, it is\nfound that there are many similarities and differences between rainbow\nfunctions I case and rainbow functions II.\n", "  The mass-metallicity relation shows that the galaxies with the lowest mass\nhave the lowest metallicities. As most dwarf galaxies are in group\nenvironments, interaction effects such as tides could contribute to this trend.\nWe perform a series of smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations of\ndwarf galaxies in external tidal fields to examine the effects of tides on\ntheir metallicities and metallicity gradients. In our simulated galaxies,\ngravitational instabilities drive gas inwards and produce centralized star\nformation and a significant metallicity gradient. Strong tides can contribute\nto these instabilities, but their primary effect is to strip the outer\nlow-metallicity gas, producing a truncated gas disk with a large metallicity.\nThis suggests that the role of tides on the mass-metallicity relation is to\nmove dwarf galaxies to higher metallicities.\n", "  We present a theory for the diffraction of large molecules or nanoparticles\nat a standing light wave. Such particles can act as a genuine photon absorbers\ndue to their numerous internal degrees of freedom effecting fast internal\nenergy conversion. Our theory incorporates the interplay of three light-induced\nproperties: the coherent phase modulation due to the dipole interaction, a\nnon-unitary absorption-induced amplitude modulation described as a generalized\nmeasurement, and a coherent recoil splitting that resembles a quantum random\nwalk in steps of the photon momentum. We discuss how these effects show up in\nnear-field and far-field interference schemes, and we confirm our effective\ndescription by a dynamic evaluation of the grating interaction, which accounts\nfor the internal states.\n", "  We report the structural, magnetic and thermodynamic properties of the double\nperovskite compound La2CuIrO6 from X-ray, neutron diffraction, neutron\ndepolarization, dc magnetization, ac susceptibility, specific heat,\nmuon-spin-relaxation (uSR), electron-spin-resonance (ESR) and nuclear magnetic\nresonance (NMR) measurements. Below ~113 K, short-range spin-spin correlations\noccur within the Cu2+ sublattice. With decreasing temperature, the Ir4+\nsublattice progressively involves in the correlation process. Below T = 74 K,\nthe magnetic sublattices of Cu (spin s = 1/2) and Ir (pseudospin j = 1/2) in\nLa2CuIrO6 are strongly coupled and exhibit an antiferromagnetic phase\ntransition into a non-collinear magnetic structure accompanied by a small\nuncompensated transverse moment. A weak anomaly in ac-susceptibility as well as\nin the NMR and {\\mu}SR spin lattice relaxation rates at 54 K is interpreted as\na cooperative ordering of the transverse moments which is influenced by the\nstrong spin-orbit coupled 5d ion Ir4+. We argue that the rich magnetic\nbehaviour observed in La2CuIrO6 is related to complex magnetic interactions\nbetween the strongly correlated spin-only 3d ions with the strongly spin-orbit\ncoupled 5d transition ions where a combination of the spin-orbit coupling and\nthe low-symmetry of the crystal lattice plays a special role for the spin\nstructure in the magnetically ordered state.\n", "  The magnetic storm around 1859 September 2, caused by so-called Carrington\nflare, was the most intense in the history of modern scientific observations,\nand hence is considered to be the benchmark event for space weather. The\nmagnetic storm caused worldwide observations of auroras even at very low\nlatitudes such as Hawaii, Panama, or Santiago, and the available magnetic field\nmeasurement at Bombay, India, showed two peaks: the main was the Carrington\nevent which occurred in day time in East Asia, and a second storm after the\nCarrington event which occurred at night in East Asia. In this paper, we\npresent a result from surveys of aurora records in East Asia, which provides\nnew information of the aurora activity of this important event. We found some\nnew East Asian records of low latitude aurora observations caused by the storm\nwhich occurred after the Carrington event. The size of the aurora belt of the\nsecond peak of the Carrington magnetic storm was even wider than usual\nlow-latitude aurora events.\n", "  We report on the experimental implementation of a spin pump with ultracold\nbosonic atoms in an optical superlattice. In the limit of isolated double wells\nit represents a 1D dynamical version of the quantum spin Hall effect. Starting\nfrom an antiferromagnetically ordered spin chain, we periodically vary the\nunderlying spin-dependent Hamiltonian and observe a spin current without charge\ntransport. We demonstrate a novel detection method to measure spin currents in\noptical lattices via superexchange oscillations emerging after a projection\nonto static double wells. Furthermore, we directly verify spin transport\nthrough in-situ measurements of the spins' center of mass displacement.\n", "  The excessive dispersion measures (DMs) and high Galactic latitudes of fast\nradio bursts (FRBs) hint toward a cosmological origin of these mysterious\ntransients. Methods of using measured DM and redshift $z$ to study cosmology\nhave been proposed, but one needs to assume a certain amount of DM contribution\nfrom the host galaxy (DM$_{\\rm HG}$) in order to apply those methods. We\nintroduce a slope parameter $\\beta(z) \\equiv d \\ln \\left< {\\rm DM}_{\\rm E}\n\\right> / d \\ln z$ (where DM$_{\\rm E}$ is the observed DM subtracting the\nGalactic contribution), which can be directly measured when a sample of FRBs\nhave $z$ measured. We show that $\\left< {\\rm DM_{HG}}\\right>$ can be roughly\ninferred from $\\beta$ and the mean values, $\\overline{\\rm \\left<DM_{\\rm\nE}\\right>}$ and $\\bar z$, of the sample. Through Monte Carlo simulations, we\nshow that the mean value of local host galaxy DM,\n$\\left<\\rm{DM_{HG,loc}}\\right>$, along with other cosmological parameters (mass\ndensity $\\Omega_m$ in the $\\Lambda$CDM model, and the IGM portion of the baryon\nenergy density $\\Omega_b f_{\\rm IGM}$) can be independently measured through\nMCMC fitting to the data.\n", "  We have used N-body simulations for the Milky Way to investigate the\nkinematic and structural properties of the old metal-poor stellar halo in the\nbarred inner region of the Galaxy. We find that the extrapolation of the\ndensity distribution for bulge RR Lyrae stars, $\\rho\\sim r^{-3}$, approximately\nmatches the number density of RR Lyrae in the nearby stellar halo. We follow\nthe evolution of such a tracer population through the formation and evolution\nof the bar and box/peanut bulge in the N-body model. We find that its density\ndistribution changes from oblate to triaxial, and that it acquires slow\nrotation in agreement with recent measurements. The maximum radial velocity is\n$\\sim15-25$ km/s at $| l|\\!=10^\\circ-30^\\circ$, and the velocity dispersion is\n$\\sim120$ km/s. Even though the simulated metal-poor halo in the bulge has a\nbarred shape, just $12\\%$ of the orbits follow the bar, and it does not trace\nthe peanut/X structure. With these properties, the RR Lyrae population in the\nGalactic bulge is consistent with being the inward extension of the Galactic\nmetal-poor stellar halo.\n", "  The ever-growing number of large spectroscopic survey programs has increased\nthe importance of fast and reliable methods with which to determine precise\nstellar parameters. Some of these methods are highly dependent on correct\nspectroscopic calibrations. The goal of this work is to obtain a new\nspectroscopic calibration for a fast estimate of Teff and [Fe/H] for a wide\nrange of stellar spectral types. We used spectra from a joint sample of 708\nstars, compiled from 451 FGK dwarfs and 257 GK-giant stars. We used\nhomogeneously determined spectroscopic stellar parameters to derive temperature\ncalibrations using a set of selected EW line-ratios, and [Fe/H] calibrations\nusing a set of selected FeI lines. We have derived 322 EW line-ratios and 100\nFeI lines that can be used to compute Teff and [Fe/H], respectively. We show\nthat these calibrations are effective for FGK dwarfs and GK-giant stars in the\nfollowing ranges: 4500 K < Teff < 6500 K , 2.5 < logg < 4.9 dex, and -0.8 <\n[Fe/H] < 0.5 dex. The new calibration has a standard deviation of 74 K for Teff\nand 0.07 dex for [Fe/H]. We use four independent samples of stars to test and\nverify the new calibration, a sample of 56 giant stars, a sample composed of\nGaia FGK benchmark stars, a sample of 36 GK-giant stars of the DR1 of the\nGaia-ESO survey, and a sample of 582 FGK-dwarf stars. We also provide a new\ncomputer code, GeTCal, for automatically producing new calibration files based\non any new sample of stars.\n", "  Interstellar bubbles are structures in the interstellar medium with diameters\nof a few to tens of parsecs. Their progenitors are stellar winds, intense\nradiation of massive stars, or supernova explosions. Star formation and young\nstellar objects are commonly associated with these structures. We compare IR\nobservations of bubbles N115, N116 and N117 with atomic, molecular and ionized\ngas in this region. While determining the dynamical properties of the bubbles,\nwe also look into their ambient environment to understand their formation in a\nwider context. For finding bubbles in HI (VLA Galactic Plane Survey) and CO\ndata (Galactic Ring Survey), we used their images from Galactic Legacy Infrared\nMid-Plane Survey. We manually constructed masks based on the appearance of the\nbubbles in the IR images and applied it to the HI and CO data. We determined\ntheir kinematic distance, size, expansion velocity, mass, original density of\nthe maternal cloud, age and energy input. We identified two systems of bubbles:\nthe first, background system, is formed by large structures G053.9+0.2 and SNR\nG054.4-0.3 and the infrared bubble N116+117. The second, foreground system,\nincludes the infrared bubble N115 and two large HI bubbles, which we discovered\nin the HI data. Both systems are independent, lying at different distances, but\nlook similar. They are both formed by two large colliding bubbles with radii\naround 20-30 pc and ages of a few million years. A younger and smaller (~4 pc,\nless than a million years) infrared bubble lies at the position of the\ncollision. We found that both infrared bubbles N115 and N116+117 are associated\nwith the collisions of larger and older bubbles. We propose, that such\ncollisions increase the probability of further star formation, probably by\nsqueezing the interstellar material, suggesting that it is an important\nmechanism for star formation.\n", "  Interplanetary imagers provide 2D projected views of the densest plasma parts\nof interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) while in situ measurements\nprovide magnetic field and plasma parameter measurements along the spacecraft\ntrajectory, so along a 1D cut. As such, the data only give a partial view of\ntheir 3D structures. By studying a large number of ICMEs, crossed at different\ndistances from their apex, we develop statistical methods to obtain a\nquantitative generic 3D shape of ICMEs. In a first approach we theoretically\nobtain the expected statistical distribution of the shock-normal orientation\nfrom assuming simple models of 3D shock shapes, including distorted profiles,\nand compare their compatibility with observed distributions. In a second\napproach we use the shock normal and the flux rope axis orientations, as well\nas the impact parameter, to provide statistical information across the\nspacecraft trajectory. The study of different 3D shock models shows that the\nobservations are compatible with a shock symmetric around the Sun-apex line as\nwell as with an asymmetry up to an aspect ratio around 3. Moreover, flat or\ndipped shock surfaces near their apex can only be rare cases. Next, the sheath\nthickness and the ICME velocity have no global trend along the ICME front.\nFinally, regrouping all these new results and the ones of our previous\narticles, we provide a quantitative ICME generic 3D shape, including the global\nshape of the shock, the sheath and the flux rope. The obtained quantitative\ngeneric ICME shape will have implications for several aims. For example, it\nconstrains the output of typical ICME numerical simulations. It is also a base\nto develop deeper studies of the transport of high energy solar and cosmic\nparticles during an ICME propagation, as well as for modeling and forecasting\nspace weather conditions near Earth.\n", "  To study the complexity of hot Jupiter atmospheres revealed by observations\nof increasing quality, we have adapted the UK Met Office global circulation\nmodel (GCM), the Unified Model (UM), to these exoplanets. The UM solves the\nfull 3D Navier-Stokes equations with a height-varying gravity, avoiding the\nsimplifications used in most GCMs currently applied to exoplanets. In this work\nwe present the coupling of the UM dynamical core to an accurate radiation\nscheme based on the two-stream approximation and correlated-k method with\nstate-of-the-art opacities from ExoMol. Our first application of this model is\ndevoted to the extensively studied hot Jupiter HD 209458b. We have derived\nsynthetic emission spectra and phase curves, and compare them to both previous\nmodels also based on state-of-the-art radiative transfer, and to observations.\nWe find a reasonable a agreement between observations and both our day side\nemission and hot spot offset, however, our night side emission is too large.\nOverall our results are qualitatively similar to those found by Showman et al.\n(2009) with the SPARC/MITgcm, however, we note several quantitative\ndifferences: Our simulations show significant variation in the position of the\nhottest part of the atmosphere with pressure, as expected from simple timescale\narguments, and in contrast to the \"vertical coherency\" found by Showman et al.\n(2009). We also see significant quantitative differences in calculated\nsynthetic observations. Our comparisons strengthen the need for detailed\nintercomparisons of dynamical cores, radiation schemes and post-processing\ntools to understand these differences. This effort is necessary in order to\nmake robust conclusions about these atmospheres based on GCM results.\n", "  Gravitational waves from binary coalescences provide one of the cleanest\nsignatures of the nature of compact objects. It has been recently argued that\nthe post-merger ringdown waveform of exotic ultracompact objects is initially\nidentical to that of a black-hole, and that putative corrections at the horizon\nscale will appear as secondary pulses after the main burst of radiation. Here\nwe extend this analysis in three important directions: (i) we show that this\nresult applies to a large class of exotic compact objects with a photon sphere\nfor generic orbits in the test-particle limit; (ii) we investigate the\nlate-time ringdown in more detail, showing that it is universally characterized\nby a modulated and distorted train of \"echoes\" of the modes of vibration\nassociated with the photon sphere; (iii) we study for the first time\nequal-mass, head-on collisions of two ultracompact boson stars and compare\ntheir gravitational-wave signal to that produced by a pair of black-holes. If\nthe initial objects are compact enough as to mimic a binary black-hole\ncollision up to the merger, the final object exceeds the maximum mass for boson\nstars and collapses to a black-hole. This suggests that - in some\nconfigurations - the coalescence of compact boson stars might be almost\nindistinguishable from that of black-holes. On the other hand, generic\nconfigurations display peculiar signatures that can be searched for in\ngravitational-wave data as smoking guns of exotic compact objects.\n", "  We consider recently introduced solutions of Einstein gravity with minimally\ncoupled massless scalars. The geometry is homogeneous, isotropic and\nasymptotically anti de-Sitter while the scalar fields have linear\nspatial-dependent profiles. The spatially-dependent marginal operators dual to\nscalar fields cause momentum dissipation in the deformed dual CFT. We study the\neffect of these marginal deformations on holographic entanglement measures and\nWilson loop. We show that the structure of the universal terms of entanglement\nentropy for d(>2)-dim deformed CFTs is corrected depending on the geometry of\nthe entangling regions. In d = 2 case, the universal term is not corrected\nwhile momentum relaxation leads to a non-critical correction. We also show that\ndecrease of the correlation length causes: the phase transition of holographic\nmutual information to happen at smaller separations and the\nconfinement/deconfinement phase transition to take place at smaller critical\nlengths. The effective potential between point like external objects also gets\ncorrected. We show that the strength of the corresponding force between these\nobjects is an increasing function of the momentum relaxation parameter.\n", "  We present MUSE integral field spectroscopic observations of the host galaxy\n(PGC 043234) of one of the closest ($z=0.0206$, $D\\simeq 90$ Mpc) and\nbest-studied tidal disruption events (TDE), ASASSN-14li. The MUSE integral\nfield data reveal asymmetric and filamentary structures that extend up to\n$\\gtrsim 10$ kpc from the post-starburst host galaxy of ASASSN-14li. The\nstructures are traced only through the strong nebular [O III] $\\lambda$5007, [N\nII] $\\lambda$6584, and H$\\alpha$ emission lines. The total off nuclear [O III]\n$\\lambda$5007 luminosity is luminosity is $4.7\\times 10^{39}$ erg s$^{-1}$ and\nthe ionized H mass is $\\rm \\sim 10^4(500/n_e)\\,M_{\\odot}$. Based on the BPT\ndiagram, the nebular emission can be driven by either AGN photoionization or\nshock excitation, with AGN photoionization favored given the narrow intrinsic\nline widths. The emission line ratios and spatial distribution strongly\nresemble ionization nebulae around fading AGNs such as IC 2497 (Hanny's\nVoorwerp) and ionization \"cones\" around Seyfert 2 nuclei. The morphology of the\nemission line filaments strongly suggest that PGC 043234 is a recent merger,\nwhich likely triggered a strong starburst and AGN activity leading to the\npost-starburst spectral signatures and the extended nebular emission line\nfeatures we see today. We briefly discuss the implications of these\nobservations in the context of the strongly enhanced TDE rates observed in\npost-starburst galaxies and their connection to enhanced theoretical TDE rates\nproduced by supermassive black-hole binaries.\n", "  We investigate the sensitivity of the colour-based quasar selection algorithm\nof the Sloan Digital Sky Survey to several key physical parameters of\nsupermassive black holes (SMBHs), focusing on BH spin ($a_{\\star}$) at the high\nBH-mass regime ($M_{BH} \\geqslant10^9\\, M_{\\odot}$). We use a large grid of\nmodel spectral energy distribution, assuming geometrically-thin,\noptically-thick accretion discs, and spanning a wide range of five physical\nparameters: BH mass $M_{BH}$, BH spin $a_{\\star}$, Eddington ratio $L /\nL_{Edd}$ , redshift $z$, and inclination angle $inc$. Based on the expected\nfluxes in the SDSS imaging ugriz bands, we find that $\\sim 99.8\\%$ of our\nmodels with $M_{BH} \\leqslant 10^{9.5}\\, M_{\\odot}$ are selected as quasar\ncandidates and thus would have been targeted for spectroscopic follow-up.\nHowever, in the extremely high-mass regime, $\\geqslant 10^{10} M_{\\odot}$, we\nidentify a bias against slowly/retrograde spinning SMBHs. The fraction of SEDs\nthat would have been selected as quasar candidates drops below $\\sim50\\%$ for\n$a_{\\star} <0$ across $0.5<z<2$. For particularly massive BHs, with $M_{BH}\n\\simeq 3\\times10^{10}\\, M_{\\odot}$, this rate drops below $\\sim20\\%$, and can\nbe yet lower for specific redshifts. We further find that the chances of\nidentifying any hypothetical sources with $M_{BH} = 10^{11}\\, M_{\\odot}$ by\ncolour selection would be extremely low at the level of $\\sim 3\\%$. Our\nfindings, along with several recent theoretical arguments and empirical\nfindings, demonstrate that the current understanding of the SMBH population at\nthe high-$M_{BH}$, and particularly the low- or retrograde-spinning regime, is\nhighly incomplete.\n", "  We present spatially-resolved HI kinematics of 32 spiral galaxies which have\nCepheid or/and Tip of the Red Giant Branch distances, and define a calibrator\nsample for the Tully-Fisher relation. The interferometric HI data for this\nsample were collected from available archives and supplemented with new GMRT\nobservations. This paper describes an uniform analysis of the HI kinematics of\nthis inhomogeneous data set. Our main result is an atlas for our calibrator\nsample that presents global HI profiles, integrated HI column-density maps, HI\nsurface density profiles and, most importantly, detailed kinematic information\nin the form of high-quality rotation curves derived from highly-resolved,\ntwo-dimensional velocity fields and position-velocity diagrams.\n", "  We present $H$-band near-infrared polarimetric imaging observations of the\nF5V star HD~157587 obtained with the Gemini Planet Imager (GPI) that reveal the\ndebris disk as a bright ring structure at a separation of $\\sim$80$-$100~AU.\nThe new GPI data complement recent HST/STIS observations that show the disk\nextending out to over 500~AU. The GPI image displays a strong asymmetry along\nthe projected minor axis as well as a fainter asymmetry along the projected\nmajor axis. We associate the minor and major axis asymmetries with polarized\nforward scattering and a possible stellocentric offset, respectively. To\nconstrain the disk geometry we fit two separate disk models to the polarized\nimage, each using a different scattering phase function. Both models favor a\ndisk inclination of $\\sim 70\\degr$ and a $1.5\\pm0.6$ AU stellar offset in the\nplane of the sky along the projected major axis of the disk. We find that the\nstellar offset in the disk plane, perpendicular to the projected major axis is\ndegenerate with the form of the scattering phase function and remains poorly\nconstrained. The disk is not recovered in total intensity due in part to strong\nadaptive optics residuals, but we recover three point sources. Considering the\nsystem's proximity to the galactic plane and the point sources' positions\nrelative to the disk, we consider it likely that they are background objects\nand unrelated to the disk's offset from the star.\n", "  On March 20, 2015, we obtained 159 spectra of the Sun as a star with the\nsolar telescope and the FTS at the Institut f\\\"ur Astrophysik G\\\"ottingen, 76\nspectra were taken during partial solar eclipse. We obtained RVs using $I_2$ as\nwavelength reference and determined the RM curve with a peak-to-peak amplitude\nof almost 1.4 km s$^{-1}$ at typical RV precision better than 1 m s$^{-1}$. We\nmodeled disk-integrated solar RVs using surface velocities, limb darkening, and\ninformation about convective blueshift from 3D magneto-hydrodynamic\nsimulations. We confirm that convective blueshift is crucial to understand\nsolar RVs during eclipse. Our best model reproduced the observations to within\na relative precision of 10% with residuals less than 30 m s$^{-1}$. We\ncross-checked parameterizations of velocity fields using a Dopplergram from the\nSolar Dynamics Observatory and conclude that disk-integration of the\nDopplergram does not provide correct information about convective blueshift\nnecessary for m s$^{-1}$ RV work. As main limitation for modeling RVs during\neclipses, we identified limited knowledge about convective blueshift and line\nshape as functions of solar limb angle. We suspect that our model line profiles\nare too shallow at limb angles larger than $\\mu = 0.6$ resulting in incorrect\nweighting of the velocities across the solar disk. Alternative explanations\ncannot be excluded like suppression of convection in magnetic areas and\nundiscovered systematics during eclipse observations. Accurate observations of\nsolar line profiles across the solar disk are suggested. We publish our RVs\ntaken during solar eclipse as a benchmark curve for codes calculating the RM\neffect and for models of solar surface velocities and line profiles.\n", "  In this work we present a summary of the most relevant results on heavy-ion\nand astroparticle physics in ALICE. The summary includes a brief overview of\nthe current status on the characterization of the hot and dense QCD medium\ncreated in the heavy-ion collisions produced at the LHC, as well as the\nintriguing finding of collective-like phenomena in small collision systems.\n", "  Quantum information processing is expressed using quantum bits (qubits) and\nquantum gates which are arranged in the terms of quantum circuits. Here, each\nqubit is associated to a quantum circuit wire which is used to conduct the\ndesired operations. Most of the existing quantum circuits allocate a single\nquantum circuit wire for each qubit and, hence, introduce a significant\noverhead. In fact, qubits are usually not needed during the entire computation\nbut only between their initialization and measurement. Before and after that,\ncorresponding wires may be used by other qubits. In this work, we propose a\nsolution which exploits this fact in order to optimize the design of quantum\ncircuits with respect to the required wires. To this end, we introduce a\nrepresentation of the lifetimes of all qubits which is used to analyze the\nrespective need for wires. Based on this analysis, a method is proposed which\n\"recycles\" the available wires and, by this, reduces the size of the resulting\ncircuit. Experimental evaluations based on established reversible and\nfault-tolerant quantum circuits confirm that the proposed solution reduces the\namount of wires by more than 90% compared to unoptimized quantum circuits.\n", "  We study the dynamics of topological defects in the magnetic texture of\nrectangular Permalloy thin film elements during relaxation from random\nmagnetization initial states. Our full micromagnetic simulations reveal complex\ndefect dynamics during relaxation towards the stable Landau closure domain\npattern, manifested as temporal power-law decay, with a system-size dependent\ncut-off time, of various quantities. These include the energy density of the\nsystem, and the number densities of the different kinds of topological defects\npresent in the system. The related power-law exponents assume non-trivial\nvalues, and are found to be different for the different defect types. The\nexponents are robust against a moderate increase in the Gilbert damping\nconstant and introduction of quenched structural disorder. We discuss details\nof the processes allowed by conservation of the winding number of the defects,\nunderlying their complex coarsening dynamics.\n", "  We present an analysis of the region IRAS 08589-4714 with the aim of\ncharacterizing the molecular environment. We observed the CO(3-2),\n^{13}CO(3-2), C^{18}O(3-2), HCO+(3-2), and HCN(3-2) molecular lines in a region\nof 150\" x 150\", centered on the IRAS source, to analyze the distribution and\ncharacteristics of the molecular gas linked to the IRAS source. The molecular\ngas distribution reveals a molecular clump that is coincident with IRAS\n08589-4714 and with a dust clump detected at 1.2 mm. The molecular clump is\n0.45 pc in radius and its mass and H_2 volume density are 310 Mo and 1.2 x 10^4\ncm^{-3}, respectively. Two overdensities were identified within the clump in\nHCN and HCO lines. A comparison of the LTE and virial masses suggests that the\nclump is collapsing in regions that harbor young stellar objects. An analysis\nof the molecular lines suggests that they are driving molecular outflows.\n", "  We present an experimental study of the quantum spin ice candidate pyrochlore\ncoumpound \\przr\\ by means of magnetization measurements, specific heat and\nneutron scattering up to 12 T and down to 60 mK. When the field is applied\nalong the $[111]$ and $[1\\bar{1}0]$ directions, ${\\bf k}=0$ field induced\nstructures settle in. We find that the ordered moment rises slowly, even at\nvery low temperature, in agreement with macroscopic magnetization.\nInterestingly, for $H \\parallel [1\\bar{1}0]$, the ordered moment appears on the\nso called $\\alpha$ chains only. The spin excitation spectrum is essentially\n{\\it inelastic} and consists in a broad flat mode centered at about 0.4 meV\nwith a magnetic structure factor which resembles the spin ice pattern. For $H\n\\parallel [1\\bar{1}0]$ (at least up to 2.5 T), we find that a well defined mode\nforms from this broad response, whose energy increases with $H$, in the same\nway as the temperature of the specific heat anomaly. We finally discuss these\nresults in the light of mean field calculations and propose a new\ninterpretation where quadrupolar interactions play a major role, overcoming the\nmagnetic exchange. In this picture, the spin ice pattern appears shifted up to\nfinite energy because of those new interactions. We then propose a range of\nacceptable parameters for \\przr\\, that allow to reproduce several experimental\nfeatures observed under field. With these parameters, the actual ground state\nof this material would be an antiferroquadrupolar liquid with spin-ice like\nexcitations.\n", "  In this note we identify photon surfaces and anti-photon surfaces in some\nphysically interesting spacetimes, which are not spherically symmetric. All of\nour examples solve physically reasonable field equations, including for some\ncases the vacuum Einstein equations, albeit they are not asymptotically flat.\nOur examples include the vacuum C-metric, the Melvin solution of\nEinstein-Maxwell theory and generalisations including dilaton fields. The\n(anti-)photon surfaces are not round spheres, and the lapse function is not\nalways constant.\n", "  Here we utilise recent measures of galaxy total dynamical mass and X-ray gas\nluminosities (L$_{X,Gas}$) for a sample of 29 massive early-type galaxies from\nthe SLUGGS survey to probe L$_{X,Gas}$--mass scaling relations. In particular,\nwe investigate scalings with stellar mass, dynamical mass within 5 effective\nradii (R$_e$) and total virial mass. We also compare these relations with\npredictions from $\\Lambda$CDM simulations. We find a strong linear relationship\nbetween L$_{X,Gas}$ and galaxy dynamical mass within 5 R$_e$, which is\nconsistent with the recent cosmological simulations of Choi et al. that\nincorporate mechanical heating from AGN. We conclude that the gas surrounding\nmassive early-type galaxies was shock heated as it fell into collapsing dark\nmatter halos so that L$_{X,Gas}$ is primarily driven by the depth of a galaxy's\npotential well. Heating by an AGN plays an important secondary role in\ndetermining L$_{X,Gas}$.\n", "  It is generally accepted that silicate-metal (`rocky') planet formation\nrelies on coagulation from a mixture of sub-Mars sized planetary embryos and\n(smaller) planetesimals that dynamically emerge from the evolving circum-solar\ndisc in the first few million years of our Solar System. Once the planets have,\nfor the most part, assembled after a giant impact phase, they continue to be\nbombarded by a multitude of planetesimals left over from accretion. Here we\nplace limits on the mass and evolution of these planetesimals based on\nconstraints from the highly siderophile element (HSE) budget of the Moon.\nOutcomes from a combination of N-body and Monte Carlo simulations of planet\nformation lead us to four key conclusions about the nature of this early epoch.\nFirst, matching the terrestrial to lunar HSE ratio requires either that the\nlate veneer on Earth consisted of a single lunar-size impactor striking the\nEarth before 4.45 Ga, or that it originated from the impact that created the\nMoon. An added complication is that analysis of lunar samples indicates the\nMoon does not preserve convincing evidence for a late veneer like Earth.\nSecond, the expected chondritic veneer component on Mars is 0.06 weight\npercent. Third, the flux of terrestrial impactors must have been low (\n<=10^(-6) M_earth/Myr) to avoid wholesale melting of Earth's crust after\n4.4~Ga, and to simultaneously match the number of observed lunar basins. This\nconclusion leads to an Hadean eon which is more clement than assumed\npreviously. Last, after the terrestrial planets had fully formed, the mass in\nremnant planetesimals was ~10^(-3) M_earth, lower by at least an order of\nmagnitude than most previous models suggest. Our dynamically and geochemically\nself-consistent scenario requires that future N-body simulations of rocky\nplanet formation either directly incorporate collisional grinding or rely on\npebble accretion.\n", "  Blue stragglers (BSS) are stars whose position in the Color-Magnitude Diagram\n(CMD) places them above the main sequence turn-off (TO) point of a star\ncluster. Using data from the core of 47 Tuc in the ultraviolet (UV), we have\nidentified various stellar populations in the CMD, and used their radial\ndistributions to study the evolution and origin of BSS, and obtain a dynamical\nestimate of the mass of BSS systems. When we separate the BSS into two samples\nby their magnitude, we find that the bright BSS show a much more centrally\nconcentrated radial distribution and thus higher mass estimate (over twice the\nTO mass for these BSS systems), suggesting an origin involving triple or\nmultiple stellar systems. In contrast, the faint BSS are less concentrated,\nwith a radial distribution similar to the main sequence (MS) binaries, pointing\nto the MS binaries as the likely progenitors of these BSS. Putting our data\ntogether with available photometric data in the visible and using MESA\nevolutionary models, we calculate the expected number of stars in each\nevolutionary stage for the normal evolution of stars and the number of stars\ncoming from the evolution of BSS. The results indicate that BSS have a post-MS\nevolution comparable to that of a normal star of the same mass and a MS BSS\nlifetime of about 200-300 Myr. We also find that the excess population of\nasymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars in 47 Tuc is due to evolved BSS.\n", "  Using the ALMA archival data of both CO(6--5) line and 689 GHz continuum\nemission towards the archetypical Seyfert galaxy, NGC 1068, we identified a\ndistinct continuum peak separated by 14 pc from the nuclear radio component S1\nin projection. The continuum flux gives a gas mass of ~2x10^5 Msun and\nbolometric luminosity of ~10^8 Lsun, leading to a star formation rate of ~0.1\nMsun/yr. Subsequent analysis on the line data suggest that the gas has a size\nof ~10 pc, yielding to mean H2 number density of ~10^5 cm^{-3}. We therefore\nrefer to the gas as \"massive dense gas cloud\": the gas density is high enough\nto form a \"proto starcluster\" whose stellar mass of ~10^4 Msun. We found that\nthe gas stands a unique position between galactic and extraglactic clouds in\nthe diagrams of start formation rate (SFR) vs. gas mass proposed by Lada et al.\nand surface density of gas vs. SFR density by Krumholz and McKee. All the\ngaseous and star-formation properties may be understood in terms of the\nturbulence-regulated star formation scenario. Since there are two stellar\npopulations with the ages of 300 Myr and 30 Myr in the 100 pc-scale\ncircumnulear region, we discuss that NGC1068 has experienced at least three\nepisodic star formation events with a tendency that the inner star-forming\nregion is the younger. Together with several lines of evidence that the\ndynamics of the nuclear region is decoupled from that of the entire galactic\ndisk, we discuss that the gas inflow towards the nuclear region of NGC 1068 may\nbe driven by a past minor merger.\n", "  We investigated the physical properties of molecular clouds and star\nformation processes around infrared bubbles which are essentially expanding HII\nregions. We performed observations of 13 galactic infrared bubble fields\ncontaining 18 bubbles. Five molecular lines, 12CO (J=1-0), 13CO (J=1-0),\nC18O(J=1-0), HCN (J=1-0), and HCO+ (J=1-0), were observed, and several publicly\navailable surveys, GLIMPSE, MIPSGAL, ATLASGAL, BGPS, VGPS, MAGPIS, and NVSS,\nwere used for comparison. We find that these bubbles are generally connected\nwith molecular clouds, most of which are giant. Several bubble regions display\nvelocity gradients and broad shifted profiles, which could be due to the\nexpansion of bubbles. The masses of molecular clouds within bubbles range from\n100 to 19,000 solar mass, and their dynamic ages are about 0.3-3.7 Myr, which\ntakes into account the internal turbulence pressure of surrounding molecular\nclouds. Clumps are found in the vicinity of all 18 bubbles, and molecular\nclouds near four of these bubbles with larger angular sizes show shell-like\nmorphologies, indicating that either collect-and-collapse or radiation-driven\nimplosion processes may have occurred. Due to the contamination of adjacent\nmolecular clouds, only six bubble regions are appropriate to search for\noutflows, and we find that four of them have outflow activities. Three bubbles\ndisplay ultra-compact HII regions at their borders, and one of them is probably\nresponsible for its outflow. In total, only six bubbles show star formation\nactivities in the vicinity, and we suggest that star formation processes might\nhave been triggered.\n", "  We have obtained simultaneous photometric and spectroscopic observations of\nthe cataclysmic variable 1RXS J064434.5+334451. We have calibrated the spectra\nfor slit losses using the simultaneous photometry allowing to construct\nreliable Doppler images from H$\\alpha$ and HeII 4686 emission lines. We have\nimproved the ephemeris of the object based on new photometric eclipse timings,\nobtaining $HJD = 2453403.759533 + 0.26937446E$. Some eclipses present a clear\ninternal structure which we attribute to a central HeII emission region\nsurrounding the white dwarf, a finding supported by the Doppler tomography.\nThis indicates that the system has a large inclination angle $i=78 \\pm\n2^{\\circ}$. We have also analysed the radial velocity curve from the emission\nlines to measure its semi--amplitude, $K_1$, from H$\\alpha$ and HeII 4686 and\nderive the masses of the components: $M_1=0.82\\pm0.06$ M$_{\\odot}$,\n$M_2=0.78\\pm0.04$ M$_{\\odot}$ and their separation $a=2.01\\pm0.06$ $R_{\\odot}$.\nThe Doppler tomography and other observed features in this nova-like system\nstrongly suggests that this is a SW Sex-type system.\n", "  About 20 percent of all nearby early-type galaxies ($M_{\\star} \\gtrsim 6\n\\times 10^{9}$ M$_{\\odot}$) outside the Virgo cluster are surrounded by a disc\nor ring of low-column-density neutral hydrogen (HI) gas with typical radii of\ntens of kpc, much larger than the stellar body. In order to understand the\nimpact of these gas reservoirs on the host galaxies, we analyse the\ndistribution of star formation out to large radii as a function of HI\nproperties using GALEX UV and SDSS optical images. Our sample consists of 18\nHI-rich galaxies as well as 55 control galaxies where no HI has been detected.\nIn half of the HI-rich galaxies the radial UV profile changes slope at the\nposition of the HI radial profile peak. To study the stellar populations, we\ncalculate the FUV-NUV and UV-optical colours in two apertures, 1-3 and 3-10\nR$_{eff}$ . We find that HI -rich galaxies are on average 0.5 and 0.8 mag bluer\nthan the HI-poor ones, respectively. This indicates that a significant fraction\nof the UV emission traces recent star formation and is associated with the HI\ngas. Using FUV emission as a proxy for star formation, we estimate the\nintegrated star formation rate in the outer regions (R > 1R$_{eff}$) to be on\naverage $6 \\times 10^{-3}$ M$_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ for the HI-rich galaxies. This\nrate is too low to build a substantial stellar disc and, therefore, change the\nmorphology of the host. We find that the star formation efficiency and the gas\ndepletion time are similar to those at the outskirts of spirals.\n", "  We present an application of machine-learning (ML) techniques to source\nselection in the optical transient survey data with Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) on\nthe Subaru telescope. Our goal is to select real transient events accurately\nand in a timely manner out of a large number of false candidates, obtained with\nthe standard difference-imaging method. We have developed the transient\nselector which is based on majority voting of three ML machines of AUC\nBoosting, Random Forest, and Deep Neural Network. We applied it to our\nobserving runs of Subaru-HSC in 2015 May and August, and proved it to be\nefficient in selecting optical transients. The false positive rate was 1.0% at\nthe true positive rate of 90% in the magnitude range of 22.0--25.0 mag for the\nformer data. For the latter run, we successfully detected and reported ten\ncandidates of supernovae within the same day as the observation. From these\nruns, we learned the following lessons: (1) the training using artificial\nobjects is effective in filtering out false candidates, especially for faint\nobjects, and (2) combination of ML by majority voting is advantageous.\n", "  Accretion-driven luminosity outbursts are a vivid manifestation of variable\nmass accretion onto protostars. They are known as the so-called FU Orionis\nphenomenon in the context of low-mass protostars. More recently, this process\nhas been found in models of primordial star formation. Using numerical\nradiation hydrodynamics simulations, we stress that present-day forming massive\nstars also experience variable accretion and show that this process is\naccompanied by luminous outbursts induced by the episodic accretion of gaseous\nclumps falling from the circumstellar disk onto the protostar. Consequently,\nthe process of accretion-induced luminous flares is also conceivable in the\nhigh-mass regime of star formation and we propose to regard this phenomenon as\na general mechanism that can affect protostars regardless of their mass and/or\nthe chemical properties of the parent environment in which they form. In\naddition to the commonness of accretion-driven outbursts in the star formation\nmachinery, we conjecture that luminous flares from regions hosting forming\nhigh-mass star may be an observational implication of the fragmentation of\ntheir accretion disks.\n", "  Mass-loss in massive stars plays a critical role in their evolution, although\nthe precise mechanism(s) responsible - radiatively driven winds, impulsive\nejection and/or binary interaction -remain uncertain. In this paper we present\nALMA line and continuum observations of the supergiant B[e] star Wd1-9, a\nmassive post-Main Sequence object located within the starburst cluster\nWesterlund 1. We find it to be one of the brightest stellar point sources in\nthe sky at millimetre wavelengths, with (serendipitously identified) emission\nin the H41alpha radio recombination line. We attribute these properties to a\nlow velocity (~100 km/s) ionised wind, with an extreme mass-loss rate\n6.4x10^-5(d/5kpc)^1.5 Msol/yr. External to this is an extended aspherical\nejection nebula indicative of a prior phase of significant mass-loss. Taken\ntogether, the millimetre properties of Wd1-9 show a remarkable similarity to\nthose of the highly luminous stellar source MWC349A.We conclude that these\nobjects are interacting binaries evolving away from the main sequence and\nundergoing rapid case-A mass transfer. As such they - and by extension the\nwider class of supergiant B[e] stars - may provide a unique window into the\nphysics of a process that shapes the life-cycle of ~70% of massive stars found\nin binary systems.\n", "  We present the results of a broadband radio-to-GeV observing campaign\norganized to get a better understanding of the radiation processes responsible\nfor the $\\gamma$-ray flares observed in 3C 279. The total intensity and\npolarization observations of the source were carried out between December 28,\n2013 and January 03, 2014 using the Fermi-LAT, Swift-XRT, Swift-UVOT, and KVN\ntelescopes. A prominent flare observed in the optical/near-UV passbands was\nfound to be correlated with a concurrent $\\gamma$-ray flare at a confidence\nlevel $>$95$\\%$, which suggests a co-spatial origin of the two. Moreover, the\nflaring activity in the two regimes was accompanied by no significant spectral\nvariations. A peak in the X-ray light curve coincides with the peaks of the\nfractional polarization curves at 43 and 86 GHz radio bands. No prominent\nvariation was noticed for the total intensity and the electric vector position\nangle (EVPA) observations at radio bands during this period. We noticed a\npossible hint of steepening of the radio spectrum with an increase in\npercentage polarization, which suggests that the radio polarization variations\ncould be simply due to a spectral change. In a simple scenario, the correlated\noptical/$\\gamma$-ray flares could be caused by the same population of emitting\nparticles. The coincidence of the increase in radio polarization with the X-ray\nflux supports the picture that X-rays are produced via inverse-Compton\nscattering of radio photons. The observed fractional variability for the\n$\\gamma$-ray flare $\\sim$0.23 does not exceed that in the optical regime, which\nis inconsistent with what we usually observe for 3C 279; it could be due to\ndifferent dependencies of the magnetic field and the external radiation field\nenergy density profiles along the jet.\n", "  Using HST slitless grism data, we report the spectroscopic confirmation of\ntwo distant structures at $z \\sim 2$ associated with powerful high-redshift\nradio-loud AGN. These rich structures, likely (forming) clusters, are among the\nmost distant currently known and were identified on the basis of Spitzer/IRAC\n[3.6] - [4.5] color. We spectroscopically confirm 9 members in the field of MRC\n2036-254, comprising eight star-forming galaxies and the targeted radio galaxy.\nThe median redshift is $z = 2.000$. We spectroscopically confirm 10 members in\nthe field of B3 0756+406, comprising eight star-forming galaxies and two AGN,\nincluding the targeted radio-loud quasar. The median redshift is $z = 1.986$.\nAll confirmed members are within 500 kpc (1 arcmin) of the targeted AGN. We\nderive median (mean) star-formation rates of $\\sim 35~M_{\\odot}\\rm ~ yr^{-1}$\n($\\sim 50~M_{\\odot}\\rm ~ yr^{-1}$) for the confirmed star-forming members of\nboth structures based on their [OIII]$\\lambda5007$ luminosities, and estimate\naverage galaxy stellar masses $\\lesssim 1 \\times 10^{11} ~M_{\\odot}$ based on\nmid-infrared fluxes and SED modeling. Most of our confirmed members are located\nabove the star-forming main-sequence towards starburst galaxies, consistent\nwith clusters at these early epochs being the sites of significant levels of\nstar formation. The structure around MRC 2036-254 shows an overdensity of\nIRAC-selected candidate galaxy cluster members consistent with being quiescent\ngalaxies, while the structure around B3 0756+406 shows field values, albeit\nwith many lower limits to colors that could allow an overdensity of faint red\nquiescent galaxies. The structure around MRC 2036-254 shows a red sequence of\npassive galaxy candidates.\n", "  The formation of supermassive stars (SMSs) via rapid mass accretion and their\ndirect collapse into black holes (BHs) is a promising pathway for sowing seeds\nof supermassive BHs in the early universe. We calculate the evolution of\nrapidly accreting SMSs by solving the stellar structure equations including\nnuclear burning as well as general relativistic (GR) effects up to the onset of\nthe collapse. We find that such SMSs have less concentrated structure than\nfully-convective counterpart, which is often postulated for non-accreting ones.\nThis effect stabilizes the stars against GR instability even above the\nclassical upper mass limit $\\gtrsim 10^5~M_\\odot$ derived for the\nfully-convective stars. The accreting SMS begins to collapse at the higher mass\nwith the higher accretion rate. The collapse occurs when the nuclear fuel is\nexhausted only for cases with $\\dot M \\lesssim 0.1~M_\\odot~{\\rm yr}^{-1}$. With\n$\\dot{M} \\simeq 0.3 - 1~M_\\odot~{\\rm yr}^{-1}$, the star becomes GR-unstable\nduring the helium-burning stage at $M \\simeq 2 - 3.5~\\times 10^5~M_\\odot$. In\nan extreme case with $10~M_\\odot~{\\rm yr}^{-1}$, the star does not collapse\nuntil the mass reaches $\\simeq 8.0\\times 10^5~M_\\odot$, where it is still in\nthe hydrogen-burning stage. We expect that BHs with roughly the same mass will\nbe left behind after the collapse in all the cases.\n", "  We analyze the quasi-two-body decays $B\\to K\\rho\\to K\\pi\\pi$ in the\nperturbative QCD (PQCD) approach, in which final-state interactions between the\npions in the resonant regions associated with the $P$-wave states $\\rho(770)$\nand $\\rho^\\prime(1450)$ are factorized into two-pion distribution amplitudes.\nAdopting experimental inputs for the time-like pion form factors involved in\ntwo-pion distribution amplitudes, we calculate branching ratios and direct $CP$\nasymmetries of the $B\\to K\\rho(770),K\\rho^\\prime(1450)\\to K\\pi\\pi$ modes. It is\nshown that agreement of theoretical results with data can be achieved, through\nwhich Gegenbauer moments of the $P$-wave two-pion distribution amplitudes are\ndetermined. The consistency between the three-body and two-body analyses of the\n$B\\to K\\rho(770)\\to K\\pi\\pi$ decays supports the PQCD factorization framework\nfor exclusive hadronic $B$ meson decays.\n", "  The chemistry of dense interstellar regions was analyzed using a\ntime-dependent gas-grain astrochemical simulation and a new chemical network\nthat incorporates deuterated chemistry taking into account nuclear spin-states\nfor the hydrogen chemistry and its deuterated isotopologues. With this new\nnetwork, the utility of the [HCO$^+$]/[DCO$^+$] abundance ratio as a probe of\nthe cosmic ray ionization rate has been reexamined, with special attention paid\nto the effect of the initial value of the molecular hydrogen ortho-to-para\nratio (OPR). After discussing the use of the probe for cold cores, we then\ncompare our results with previous theoretical and observational results for a\nmolecular cloud close to the supernova remnant W51C, which is thought to have\nan enhanced cosmic ray ionization rate $\\zeta$ caused by the nearby\n$\\gamma$-ray source. In addition, we attempt to use our approach to estimate\nthe cosmic ray ionization rate for L1174, a dense core with an embedded star.\nBeyond the previously known sensitivity of [HCO$^+$]/[DCO$^+$] to $\\zeta$, we\ndemonstrate its additional dependence on the initial OPR and, secondarily, on\nthe age of the source, its temperature, and its density. We conclude that the\nusefulness of the [HCO$^+$]/[DCO$^+$] abundance ratio to constrain the cosmic\nray ionization rate in dense regions increases with source age and ionization\nrate as the ratio becomes far less sensitive to the initial value of the OPR.\n", "  When exploring the stability of multiplanet systems in binaries, two\nparameters are normally exploited: the critical semimajor axis ac computed by\nHolman and Wiegert (1999) within which planets are stable against the binary\nperturbations, and the Hill stability limit Delta determining the minimum\nseparation beyond which two planets will avoid mutual close encounters. Our aim\nis to test whether these two parameters can be safely applied in multiplanet\nsystems in binaries or if their predictions fail for particular binary orbital\nconfigurations. We have used the frequency map analysis (FMA) to measure the\ndiffusion of orbits in the phase space as an indicator of chaotic behaviour.\nFirst we revisited the reliability of the empirical formula computing ac in the\ncase of single planets in binaries and we find that, in some cases, it\nunderestimates by 10-20% the real outer limit of stability. For two planet\nsystems, the value of Delta is close to that computed for planets around single\nstars, but the level of chaoticity close to it substantially increases for\nsmaller semimajor axes and higher eccentricities of the binary orbit. In these\nconfigurations ac also begins to be unreliable and non linear secular\nresonances with the stellar companion lead to chaotic behaviour well within ac,\neven for single planet systems. For two planet systems, the superposition of\nmean motion resonances, either mutual or with the binary companion, and non\nlinear secular resonances may lead to chaotic behaviour in all cases. We have\ndeveloped a parametric semiempirical formula determining the minimum value of\nthe binary semimajor axis, for a given eccentricity of the binary orbit, below\nwhich stable two planet systems cannot exist.\n", "  We explore the transport of energetic particles in two-component turbulence\nin which the stochastic magnetic field is assumed to be a superposition of slab\nand two-dimensional modes. It is known that in magnetostatic slab turbulence,\nthe motion of particles across the mean magnetic field is subdiffusive. If a\ntwo-dimensional component is added, diffusion is recovered. It was also shown\nbefore that in two-component turbulence, the slab modes do not explicitly\ncontribute to the perpendicular diffusion coefficient. In the current paper the\nimplicit contribution of slab modes is explored and it is shown that this\ncontribution leads to a reduction of the perpendicular diffusion coefficient.\nThis effect improves the agreement between simulations and analytical theory.\nFurthermore, the obtained results are relevant for investigations of diffusive\nshock acceleration.\n", "  Recently one has stated that temporal disorder constitutes a relevant\nperturbation in absorbing phase transitions for all dimensions. However, its\neffect for systems other than the standard contact process (CP), its\ncompetition with other ingredients (e.g. particle diffusion) and other kinds of\ndisorder (besides the standard types) are unknown. In order to shed some light\nin the above mentioned points, we investigate a variant of the usual CP, namely\ntriplet annihilation model (TAM), in which the competition between triplet\nannihilation and single particle diffusion leads to an unusual phase diagram\nbehavior, with reentrant shape and endless activity for sufficient large\ndiffusion rates. Two kinds of time-dependent disorder have been considered. In\nthe former, it is introduced in the creation-annihilation parameters (as\ncommonly considered in recent studies), whereas in the latter the diffusion\nrate $D$ (so far unexplored) is allowed to be time dependent. In all cases, the\ndisorder follows an uniform distribution with fixed mean and width $\\sigma$.\nTwo values of $\\sigma$ have been considered, in order to exemplify the regime\nof \"weaker\" and \"stronger\" temporal disorder strengths. Our results show that\nin the former approach, the disorder suppresses the reentrant phase diagram\nwith a critical behavior deviating from the directed percolation universality\nclass (DP) in the regime of low diffusion rates, while they strongly suggest\nthat the DP class is recovered for larger hoping rates. An opposite scenario is\nfound in the latter disorder approach, with a substantial increase of reentrant\nshape and the maximum diffusion, in which the reentrant shape also displays a\ncritical behavior consistent to the DP universality class (in similarity with\nthe pure model). Lastly, comparison with the diffusive disordered CP has been\nundertaken.\n", "  Limiting ourselves to two flavor approximation the motion of the neutrino\nflux in the solar matter and twisting magnetic field is considered. For the\nneutrino system described by the 4-component wave function $\\Psi^T = (\\nu_{eL},\n\\nu_{XL}, {\\overline\\nu}_{eR}, {\\overline\\nu}_{XL})$, where $X=\\mu, \\tau$, an\nevolution equation is found. Our consideration carries general character, that\nis, it holds for any SM extensions with massive neutrinos. The resonance\ntransitions of the electron neutrinos are investigated. Factors which influence\non the electron neutrino flux, crossing a region of solar flares (SF) are\ndefined. When the SF is absent a terrestrial detector records the electron\nneutrino flux weakened at the cost both of vacuum oscillations and of the MSW\nresonance conversion only. On the other hand, the electron neutrino flux passed\nthe SF region in preflare period proves to be further weakened in so far as it\nundergoes one (Majorana neutrino) or two (Dirac neutrino) additional resonance\nconversions, apart from the MSW resonance and vacuum oscillations. The\nhypothesis of the $\\nu_e$-induced decays which states that decreasing the beta\ndecay rates of some elements of the periodic table is caused by reduction of\nthe solar neutrino flux is discussed as well.\n  PACS number(s): 12.60.Cn, 14.60.Pg, 96.60.Kx, 95.85.Qx, 96.60.Rd.\n", "  Aims: for the first time the astrometric capabilities of the Multi-Conjugate\nAdaptive Optics (MCAO) facility GeMS with the GSAOI camera on Gemini-South are\ntested to quantify the accuracy in determining stellar proper motions in the\nGalactic globular cluster NGC 6681. Methods: proper motions from HST/ACS for a\nsample of its stars are already available, and this allows us to construct a\ndistortion-free reference at the epoch of GeMS observations that is used to\nmeasure and correct the temporally changing distortions for each GeMS exposure.\nIn this way, we are able to compare the corrected GeMS images with a\nfirst-epoch of HST/ACS images to recover the relative proper motion of the\nSagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy with respect to NGC 6681. Results: we find\nthis to be (\\mu_{\\alpha}cos\\delta, \\mu_{\\delta}) = (4.09,-3.41) mas/yr, which\nmatches previous HST/ACS measurements with a very good accuracy of 0.03 mas/yr\nand with a comparable precision (r.m.s of 0.43 mas/yr). Conclusions: this study\nsuccessfully demonstrates that high-quality proper motions can be measured for\nquite large fields of view (85 arcsec X 85 arcsec) with MCAO-assisted,\nground-based cameras and provides a first, successful test of the performances\nof GeMS on multi-epoch data.\n", "  This automated catalogue combines all the largest published optical, radio\nand X-ray sky catalogues to find probable radio/X-ray associations to optical\nobjects, plus double radio lobes, using uniform processing against all input\ndata. The total count is 1002855 optical objects so presented. Each object is\ndisplayed with J2000 astrometry, optical and radio/X-ray identifiers, red and\nblue photometry, and calculated probabilities and optical field solutions of\nthe associations. This is the third and final edition of this method.\n", "  The radio and gamma-ray pulsar PSR J2032+4127 was recently found to be in a\ndecades-long orbit with the Be star MT91 213, with the pulsar moving rapidly\ntowards periastron. This binary shares many similar characteristics with the\npreviously unique binary system PSR B1259-63/LS 2883. Here, we describe radio,\nX-ray, and optical monitoring of PSR J2032+4127/MT91 213. Our extended orbital\nphase coverage in radio, supplemented with Fermi gamma-ray data, allows us to\nupdate and refine the orbital period to 45-50 yr and time of periastron passage\nto 2017 November. We analyse archival and recent Chandra and Swift observations\nand show that PSR J2032+4127/MT91 213 is now brighter in X-rays by a factor of\n~70 since 2002 and ~20 since 2010. While the pulsar is still far from\nperiastron, this increase in X-rays is possibly due to collisions between\npulsar and Be star winds. Optical observations of the Halpha emission line of\nthe Be star suggest that the size of its circumstellar disc may be varying by\n~2 over timescales as short as 1-2 months. Multiwavelength monitoring of PSR\nJ2032+4127/MT91 213 will continue through periastron passage, and the system\nshould present an interesting test case and comparison to PSR B1259-63/LS 2883.\n", "  The Mount Wilson Ca II index log$(R'_{\\rm HK})$ is the accepted standard\nmetric of calibration for the chromospheric activity versus age relation of FGK\nstars. Recent results claim its inability to discern activity levels, and thus\nages, for stars older than $\\sim$2 Gyr, which would severely hamper its\napplication to date disk stars older than the Sun. We present a new\nactivity-age calibration of the Mt. Wilson index explicitly taking into account\nmass and $[$Fe/H$]$ biases, implicit in samples of stars selected to have\nprecise ages, that have so far gone unappreciated. We show that these selection\nbiases tend to blur the activity-age relation for large age ranges. We\ncalibrate the Mt. Wilson index for a sample of field FGK stars with precise\nages, covering a wide range of mass and $[$Fe/H$]$, augmented with data from\nthe Pleiades, Hyades, M67 clusters, and the Ursa Major moving group. We further\ntest the calibration with extensive new Gemini/GMOS log$(R'_{\\rm HK})$ data of\nthe old, solar $[$Fe/H$]$ clusters M67 and NGC 188. The observed NGC 188\nactivity level is clearly lower than M67. We correctly recover the isochronal\nage of both clusters and establish the viability of deriving usable\nchromospheric ages for solar-type stars up to at least $\\sim$6 Gyr, average\nerrors being $\\sim$0.14 dex provided that the mass and $[$Fe/H$]$ dimensions\nare explicitly accounted for. We test our calibration against\nasteroseismological ages, finding excellent correlation ($\\rho$ = +0.89). We\nshow that our calibration improves the chromospheric age determination for a\nwide range of ages, masses, and metallicities in comparison to previous\nage-activity relations.\n", "  We study the large solar energetic particle (SEP) events that were detected\nby GOES in the $>$ 10 MeV energy channel during December 2006 to March 2014. We\nderive and compare solar particle release (SPR) times for the 0.25--10.4 MeV\nelectrons and 10--100 MeV protons for the 28 SEP events. In the study, the\nelectron SPR times are derived with the time-shifting analysis (TSA) and the\nproton SPR times are derived using both the TSA and the velocity dispersion\nanalysis (VDA). Electron anisotropies are computed to evaluate the amount of\nscattering for the events under study. Our main results include:\n1)near-relativistic electrons and high-energy protons are released at the same\ntime within 8 min for most (16 of 23) SEP events. 2)There exists a good\ncorrelation between electron and proton acceleration, peak intensity and\nintensity time profiles. 3) The TSA SPR times for 90.5 MeV and 57.4 MeV protons\nhave maximum errors of 6 min and 10 min compared to the proton VDA release\ntimes, respectively, while the maximum error for 15.4 MeV protons can reach to\n32 min. 4) For 7 low-intensity events of the 23, large delays occurred between\n6.5 MeV electrons and 90.5 MeV protons relative to 0.5 MeV electrons. Whether\nthese delays are due to times needed for the evolving shock to be strengthened\nor due to particle transport effects remains unresolved.\n", "  Fast magnetic reconnection may occur in different astrophysical sources,\nproducing flare-like emission and particle acceleration. Currently, this\nprocess is being studied as an efficient mechanism to accelerate particles via\na first-order Fermi process. In this work we analyse the acceleration rate and\nthe energy distribution of test particles injected in three-dimensional\nmagnetohydrodynamical (MHD) domains with large-scale current sheets where\nreconnection is made fast by the presence of turbulence. We study the\ndependence of the particle acceleration time with the relevant parameters of\nthe embedded turbulence, i.e., the Alfv\\'en speed $V_{\\rm A}$, the injection\npower $P_{\\rm inj}$ and scale $k_{\\rm inj}$ ($k_{\\rm inj} = 1/l_{\\rm inj}$). We\nfind that the acceleration time follows a power-law dependence with the\nparticle kinetic energy: $t_{acc} \\propto E^{\\alpha}$, with $0.2 < \\alpha <\n0.6$ for a vast range of values of $c / V_{\\rm A} \\sim 20 - 1000$. The\nacceleration time decreases with the Alfv\\'en speed (and therefore with the\nreconnection velocity) as expected, having an approximate dependence $t_{acc}\n\\propto (V_{\\rm A} / c)^{-\\kappa}$, with $\\kappa \\sim 2.1- 2.4$ for particles\nreaching kinetic energies between $1 - 100 \\, m_p c^2$, respectively.\nFurthermore, we find that the acceleration time is only weakly dependent on the\n$P_{\\rm inj}$ and $l_{\\rm inj}$ parameters of the turbulence. The particle\nspectrum develops a high-energy tail which can be fitted by a hard power-law\nalready in the early times of the acceleration, in consistency with the results\nof kinetic studies of particle acceleration by magnetic reconnection in\ncollisionless plasmas.\n", "  We observe that high-Q electromagnetic cavity resonances increase the\ncyclotron cooling rate of pure electron plasmas held in a Penning-Malmberg trap\nwhen the electron cyclotron frequency, controlled by tuning the magnetic field,\nmatches the frequency of standing wave modes in the cavity. For certain modes\nand trapping configurations, this can increase the cooling rate by factors of\nten or more. In this paper, we investigate the variation of the cooling rate\nand equilibrium plasma temperatures over a wide range of parameters, including\nthe plasma density, plasma position, electron number, and magnetic field.\n", "  The XQ-100 survey provides optical and near infrared coverage of 36 blindly\nselected, intervening damped Lyman alpha systems (DLAs) at 2 < z < 4,\nsimultaneously covering the MgII doublet at 2796A, 2803A, and the Ly-alpha\ntransition. Using the XQ-100 DLA sample, we investigate the completeness of\nselecting DLA absorbers based on their MgII rest-frame equivalent width (W2796)\nat these redshifts. Of the 29 DLAs with clean MgII profiles, we find that six\n(20% of DLAs) have W2796 < 0.6A. The DLA incidence rate of W2796 < 0.6A\nabsorbers is a factor of ~5 higher than what is seen in z~1 samples, indicating\na potential evolution in the MgII properties of DLAs with redshift. All of the\nW2796 < 0.6A DLAs have low metallicities (-2.5 < [M/H] < -1.7), small velocity\nwidths (v90 < 50 km/s), and tend to have relatively low N(HI). We demonstrate\nthat the exclusion of these low W2796 DLAs results in a higher mean N(HI) which\nin turn leads to a ~7% increase in the cosmological gas density of HI of DLAs\nat 2 < z < 4; and that this exclusion has a minimal effect on the HI-weighted\nmean metallicity.\n", "  Based on the investigation of the multi-terminal conductance of a system\ncomposed of two graphene nanoribbons, in which one is on top of the other and\nrotated by 60 degrees, we propose a setup for a 50/50 electronic beam splitter\nthat neither requires large magnetic fields nor ultra low temperatures. Our\nfindings are based on an atomistic tight-binding description of the system and\non the Green's function method to compute the Landauer conductance. We\ndemonstrate that this system acts as a perfect 50/50 electronic beam splitter,\nin which its operation can be switched on and off by varying the doping (Fermi\nenergy). We show that this device is robust against thermal fluctuations and\nlong range disorder, as zigzag valley chiral states of the nanoribbons are\nprotected against backscattering. We suggest that the proposed device can be\napplied as the fundamental element of the Hong-Ou-Mandel interferometer, as\nwell as a building block of many devices in electron optics.\n", "  Understanding the nature of spiral structure in disk galaxies is one of the\nmain, and still unsolved questions in galactic astronomy. However, theoretical\nworks are proposing new testable predictions whose detection is becoming\nfeasible with recent development in instrumentation. In particular, streaming\nmotions along spiral arms are expected to induce azimuthal variations in the\nchemical composition of a galaxy at a given galactic radius. In this letter we\nanalyse the gas content in NGC 6754 with VLT/MUSE data to characterise its 2D\nchemical composition and H$\\alpha$ line-of-sight velocity distribution. We find\nthat the trailing (leading) edge of the NGC 6754 spiral arms show signatures of\ntangentially-slower, radially-outward (tangentially-faster, radially-inward)\nstreaming motions of metal-rich (poor) gas over a large range of radii. These\nresults show direct evidence of gas radial migration for the first time. We\ncompare our results with the gas behaviour in a $N$-body disk simulation\nshowing spiral morphological features rotating with a similar speed as the gas\nat every radius, in good agreement with the observed trend. This indicates that\nthe spiral arm features in NGC 6754 may be transient and rotate similarly as\nthe gas does at a large range of radii.\n", "  A general technique to analyze the classical interaction between ideal\ntopological insulators, and electromagnetic sources and fields, has been\npreviously elaborated. Nevertheless it is not immediately applicable in the\nlaboratory as it fails to describe real ponderable media. In this work we\nprovide a description of real topologically insulating materials taking into\naccount their dielectric and magnetic properties. For inhomogeneous\npermittivity and permeability, the problem of finding the Green's function must\nbe solved in an ad hoc manner. Nevertheless, the physically feasible cases of\npiecewise constant $\\varepsilon, \\mu$ and $\\theta$ make the problem tractable,\nwhere $\\theta$ encodes the topological magnetoelectric polarizability\nproperties of the medium. To this end we employ the Green's function method to\nfind the fields resulting form the interaction between these materials and\nelectromagnetic sources. Furthermore we exploit the fact that in the cases here\nstudied, the full Green's function can be successfully found if the Green's\nfunction of the corresponding ponderable media with $\\theta = 0$ is known. Our\nresults, satisfactorily reproduce previously existing ones and also generalize\nsome others. The method here elaborated can be exploited to determine the\nelectromagnetic fields for more general configurations aiming to measure the\ninteraction between real 3D topological insulators and electromagnetic fields.\n", "  The critical behavior of the cubic helimagnet FeGe was obtained from\nisothermal magnetization data in very close vicinity of the ordering\ntemperature. A thorough and consistent scaling analysis of these data revealed\nthe critical exponents $\\beta=0.368$, $\\gamma=1.382$, and $\\delta=4.787$. The\nanomaly in the specific heat associated with the magnetic ordering can be well\ndescribed by the critical exponent $\\alpha=-0.133$. The values of these\nexponents corroborate that the magnetic phase transition in FeGe belongs to the\nisotropic 3D-Heisenberg universality class. The specific heat data are well\ndescribed by ab initio phonon calculations and confirm the localized character\nof the magnetic moments.\n", "  $Context.$ Pulsating stars are windows to the physics of stars enabling us to\nsee glimpses of their interior. Not all stars pulsate, however. On the main\nsequence, pulsating stars form an almost continuous sequence in brightness,\nexcept for a magnitude range between $\\delta$ Scuti and slowly pulsating B\nstars. Against all expectations, 36 periodic variables were discovered in 2013\nin this luminosity range in the open cluster NGC 3766, the origins of which was\na mystery. $Aims.$ We investigate the properties of those new variability class\ncandidates in relation to their stellar rotation rates and stellar\nmultiplicity. $Methods.$ We took multi-epoch spectra over three consecutive\nnights using ESO's Very Large Telescope. $Results.$ We find that the majority\nof the new variability class candidates are fast-rotating pulsators that obey a\nnew period-luminosity relation. We argue that the new relation discovered here\nhas a different physical origin to the period-luminosity relations observed for\nCepheids. $Conclusions.$ We anticipate that our discovery will boost the\nrelatively new field of stellar pulsation in fast-rotating stars, will open new\ndoors for asteroseismology, and will potentially offer a new tool to estimate\nstellar ages or cosmic distances.\n", "  The information content of the two-particle one- and two-dimensional Calogero\nmodel is studied using the von Neumann and R\\'enyi entropies. The\none-dimensional model is shown to have non-monotonic entropies with finite\nvalues in the large interaction strength limit. On the other hand, the von\nNeumann entropy of the two-dimensional model with isotropic confinement is a\nmonotone increasing function of the interaction strength which diverges\nlogarithmically. By considering an anisotropic confinement in the\ntwo-dimensional case we show that the one-dimensional behavior is eventually\nreached when the anisotropy increases. The crossover from two to one dimensions\nis demonstrated using the harmonic approximation and it is shown that the von\nNeumann divergence only occurs in the isotropic case. The R\\'enyi entropies are\nused to highlight the structure of the model spectrum. In particular, it is\nshown that these entropies have a non-monotonic and non-analytical behavior in\nthe neighborhood of the interaction strength parameter values where the Hilbert\nspace and, consequently, the spectrum of the reduced density matrix are both\nfinite.\n", "  Cosmological implications of Higgs field fluctuations during inflation are\nconsidered. This study is based on the Standard Model and the standard\nquadratic model of chaotic inflation where the Higgs field is minimally coupled\nto gravity and has no direct coupling to the inflaton. In the Standard model\nthe renormalisation group improved effective potential develops an instability\n(an additional minimum and maximum) at large field values. It is shown that\nsuch a new maximum should take place at an energy scale above $10^{14}\n\\;\\text{GeV},$ otherwise a universe like ours is extremely unlikely. The\nextension to the case of the Higgs field interacting with the inflaton field is\ndiscussed.\n", "  We present follow-up X-ray observations of the candidate massive black hole\n(BH) in the nucleus of the low-mass, compact starburst galaxy Henize 2-10.\nUsing new high-resolution observations from the Chandra X-ray Observatory\ntotaling 200 ks in duration, as well as archival Chandra observations from\n2001, we demonstrate the presence of a previously unidentified X-ray point\nsource that is spatially coincident with the known nuclear radio source in\nHenize 2-10 (i.e., the massive BH). We show that the hard X-ray emission\npreviously identified in the 2001 observation is dominated by a source that is\ndistinct from the nucleus, with the properties expected for a high-mass X-ray\nbinary. The X-ray luminosity of the nuclear source suggests the massive BH is\nradiating significantly below its Eddington limit (~10^-6 L_Edd), and the soft\nspectrum resembles other weakly accreting massive BHs including Sagittarius A*.\nAnalysis of the X-ray light curve of the nucleus reveals the tentative\ndetection of a ~9-hour periodicity, although additional observations are\nrequired to confirm this result. Our study highlights the need for sensitive\nhigh-resolution X-ray observations to probe low-level accretion, which is the\ndominant mode of BH activity throughout the Universe.\n", "  Knowing the metallicity distribution of stars in the Galactic Centre has\nimportant implications for the formation history of the Milky Way nuclear star\ncluster. However, this distribution is not well known, and is currently based\non a small sample of fewer than 100 stars. We obtained near-infrared K-band\nspectra of more than 700 late-type stars in the central 4 pc^2 of the Milky Way\nnuclear star cluster with the integral-field spectrograph KMOS (VLT). We\nanalyse the medium-resolution spectra using a full-spectral fitting method\nemploying the G\\\"ottingen Spectral library of synthetic PHOENIX spectra. The\nderived stellar metallicities range from metal-rich [M/H]>+0.3 dex to\nmetal-poor [M/H]<-1.0 dex, with a fraction of 5.2(^{+6.0}+{-3.1}) per cent\nmetal-poor ([M/H]<-0.5 dex) stars. The metal-poor stars are distributed over\nthe entire observed field. The origin of metal-poor stars remains unclear. They\ncould originate from infalling globular clusters. For the metal-rich stellar\npopulation ([M/H]>0 dex) a globular cluster origin can be ruled out. As there\nis only a very low fraction of metal-poor stars in the central 4 pc^2 of the\nGalactic Centre, we believe that our data can discard a scenario in which the\nMilky Way nuclear star cluster is purely formed from infalling globular\nclusters.\n", "  Transitional millisecond pulsars (tMSPs) switch, on roughly multi-year\ntimescales, between rotation-powered radio millisecond pulsar (RMSP) and\naccretion-powered low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) states. The tMSPs have raised\nseveral questions related to the nature of accretion flow in their LMXB state\nand the mechanism that causes the state switch. The discovery of coherent X-ray\npulsations from PSR J1023+0038 (while in the LMXB state) provides us with the\nfirst opportunity to perform timing observations and to compare the neutron\nstar's spin variation during this state to the measured spin-down in the RMSP\nstate. Whereas the X-ray pulsations in the LMXB state likely indicate that some\nmaterial is accreting onto the neutron star's magnetic polar caps, radio\ncontinuum observations indicate the presence of an outflow. The fraction of the\ninflowing material being ejected is not clear, but it may be much larger than\nthat reaching the neutron star's surface. Timing observations can measure the\ntotal torque on the neutron star. We have phase-connected nine XMM-Newton\nobservations of PSR J1023+0038 over the last 2.5 years of the LMXB state to\nestablish a precise measurement of spin evolution. We find that the average\nspin-down rate as an LMXB is 26.8+/-0.4% faster than the rate (-2.39x10^-15 Hz\ns-1) determined during the RMSP state. This shows that negative angular\nmomentum contributions (dipolar magnetic braking and outflow) exceed positive\nones (accreted material), and suggests that the pulsar wind continues to\noperate at a largely unmodified level. We discuss implications of this tight\nobservational constraint in the context of possible accretion models.\n", "  Chandra observations have revealed a feature,within 16\" of Cygnus X-3 which\nvaried in phase with Cygnus X-3. This feature was shown to be a Bok globule\nwhich is along the line of sight to Cygnus X-3. We report on observations made\nwith Submillimeter Array (SMA) to search for molecular emission from this\nglobule, also known as Cygnus X-3's \"Little Friend\" (LF). We have found a\ncounterpart in both 12CO (2-1) and 13}CO (2-1) emission. From the velocity\nshift of the molecular lines, we are able to find two probable distances based\non the Bayesian model of Milky Way kinematics of Reid et al. 2016. For the LF\nvelocity of -47.5 km/s, we get a distance of 6.1 +/- 0.6 kpc (62% probability)\nand 7.8 +/- 0.6 ~kpc (38% probability). This yields a distance to Cyg X-3 of\n7.4 +/- 1.1 kpc and 10.2 +/-1.2 ~kpc, respectively. Based on the probabilities\nentailed, we take 7.4 +/- 1.1 kpc as the preferred distance to Cyg X-3. We also\nreport the discovery of bipolar molecular outflow, suggesting that there is\nactive star formation occurring within the Little Friend.\n", "  Sizes of the sunspots vary in a wide range during the progression of a solar\ncycle. Long-term variation study of different sunspot sizes are key to better\nunderstand the underlying process of sunspot formation and their connection to\nthe solar dynamo. Kodaikanal white-light digitized archive provides daily\nsunspot observations for a period of 90 years (1921-2011). Using different size\ncriteria on the detected individual sunspots, we have generated yearly averaged\nsunspot area time series for the full Sun as well as for the individual\nhemispheres. In this paper, we have used the sunspot area values instead of\nsunspot numbers used in earlier studies. Analysis of these different time\nseries show that different properties of the sunspot cycles depend on the\nsunspot sizes. The `odd-even rule', double peaks during the cycle maxima and\nthe long-term periodicities in the area data are found to be present for\nspecific sunspot sizes and are absent or not so prominent in other size ranges.\nApart from that, we also find a range of periodicities in the asymmetry index\nwhich have a dependency on the sunspot sizes. These statistical differences in\nthe different size ranges may indicate that a complex dynamo action is\nresponsible for the generation and dynamics of sunspots with different sizes.\n", "  We report the first evidence of a hot corino in a Bok globule. This is based\non the ALMA observations in the 1.2 mm band toward the low-mass Class 0\nprotostar IRAS 19347+0727 in B335. Saturated complex organic molecules (COMs),\nCH$_3$CHO, HCOOCH$_3$, and NH$_2$CHO, are detected in a compact region within a\nfew 10 au around the protostar. Additionally, CH$_3$OCH$_3$, C$_2$H$_5$OH,\nC$_2$H$_5$CN, and CH$_3$COCH$_3$ are tentatively detected. Carbon-chain related\nmolecules, CCH and c-C$_3$H$_2$, are also found in this source, whose\ndistributions are extended over a few 100 au scale. On the other hand,\nsulfur-bearing molecules CS, SO, and SO$_2$, have both compact and extended\ncomponents. Fractional abundances of the COMs relative to H$_2$ are found to be\ncomparable to those in known hot-corino sources. Though the COMs lines are as\nbroad as 5-8 km s$^{-1}$, they do not show obvious rotation motion in the\npresent observation. Thus, the COMs mainly exist in a structure whose\ndistribution is much smaller than the synthesized beam (0.\"58 x 0.\"52).\n", "  Slow long-lived fluctuations of mechanical properties of drying drops of\ninstant coffee water solutions have been found by means of the Drying Drop\nTechnology developed earlier. Parameters of the fluctuations depended on the\nextent of dilution and were not affected by additional hashing of the solution,\nclosing by a cover and shielding from external electromagnetic fields [1-3].\nHere we compared dynamics of physicochemical and morphological processes in\nbulk. We observed microscopically periodic emergence, growth, aggregation and\ndisappearance of spherical cavities (50-250 micrometers in diameter) in bulk of\ndispersion, which was followed by agreed fluctuations of physicochemical\nparameters of the colloidal system. We have shown that those spheres were huge\nhydrate covers of liquid crystal water around colloidal particles. Phase\ntransitions between free and bound (liquid crystal) water in a bulk of a\ncolloidal system is a pacemaker of fluctuations of its physicochemical\nproperties. These changes are regulated and coordinated by the value of osmotic\npressure. At low osmotic pressure hydrate covers grow, forcing out particles\nand ions into the bulk; at high osmotic pressure they collapse to small size,\nreducing osmotic pressure. Existence of self-oscillatory processes was\nconfirmed by a mathematical model.\n", "  Zinc metal-silicate fractionation provides experimental access to the\nconditions of core formation and Zn has been used to estimate the S contents of\nthe Earth's core and of the bulk Earth, assuming that they share similar\nvolatility and that Zn was not partitioned into the Earth's core. We have\nconducted a suite of partitioning experiments to characterize Zn metal-silicate\nelemental and isotopic fractionation as a function of time, temperature, and\ncomposition. Experiments were conducted at temperatures from 1473-2273K, with\nrun durations from 5-240 minutes for four starting materials. Chemical and\nisotopic equilibrium is achieved within 10 minutes. Zinc metal-silicate\nisotopic fractionation displays no resolvable dependence on temperature,\ncomposition, or oxygen fugacity. Thus, the Zn isotopic composition of silicate\nphases can be used as a proxy for bulk telluric bodies. Results from this study\nand literature data were used to parameterize Zn metal-silicate partitioning as\na function of temperature, pressure, and redox state. Using this\nparameterization and viable formation conditions, we have estimated a range of\nZn contents in the cores of iron meteorite parent bodies (i.e. iron meteorites)\nof ~0.1-150 ppm, in good agreement with natural observations. We have\ncalculated the first geochemical estimates for the Zn contents of the Earth's\ncore and of the bulk Earth, at 242 +/-107 ppm and 114 +/-34 ppm (respectively),\nthat consider the slightly siderophile behavior of Zn and are therefore\nsignificantly higher than previous estimates. Assuming similar volatility for S\nand Zn, a chondritic S/Zn ratio, and considering our new estimates, we have\ncalculated a geochemical upper bound for the S content of the Earth's core of\n6.3 +/-1.9 wt%. This indicates that S may be a major contributor to the density\ndeficit of the Earth's core or that the S/Zn ratio for the Earth is\nnon-chondritic.\n", "  Galactic nuclei, like the one of the Milky Way, are extreme places with high\nstellar densities and, in most cases, hosting a supermassive black hole. One of\nthe scenarios proposed for the formation of the Galactic nucleus is by merging\nof primordial globular clusters (Capuzzo-Dolcetta 1993). An implication of this\nmodel is that this region should host stars characteristically found in old\nMilky Way globular clusters. RR Lyrae stars are primary distance indicators,\nwell known representatives of old and metal-poor stellar populations, and\ntherefore regularly found in globular clusters. Here we report the discovery of\na dozen RR Lyrae ab-type stars in the vicinity of the Galactic center, i.e. in\nthe so-called nuclear stellar bulge of the Milky Way. This discovery provides\nthe first direct observational evidence that the Galactic nuclear stellar bulge\ncontains ancient stars (>10 Gyr old). Based on this we conclude that merging\nglobular clusters likely contributed to building-up the high stellar density in\nthe nuclear stellar bulge of the Milky Way.\n", "  We consider spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ model on the honeycomb lattice in the presence\nof weak magnetic field $h\\ll J$. Such a perturbation treated in the second\norder over $h$ leads to the power-law decay of irreducible spin correlation\nfunction $S(\\mathbf{r},t)=\\left\\langle \\left\\langle\ns^{z}_r(t)s^{z}_0(0)\\right\\rangle \\right\\rangle \\propto\nh_{z}^{2}f(t,\\mathbf{r})$, where $f(t,\\mathbf{r})\\propto \\lbrack \\max\n(t,Jr)]^{-4}$ is an oscillating function of $\\mathbf{r}$, with a wavelength\nequal to 3 lattice constants. In the present Letter we sum main terms in all\norders of the perturbation theory for the correlation function\n$S(\\mathbf{r},t)$ in the limit of large $r,t$. Our results can be understood in\nterms of the effective low-energy Hamiltonian written in terms of Majorana\nfermions, which in the presence of magnetic field acquire vector potential $A_x\n\\propto h_z^2$. Correspondingly, the wave vector of the oscillations in\n$S(\\mathbf{r},t)$ changes according to $\\delta k \\propto h_z^2$. We also\ncompute the dynamic structure factor $S(\\mathbf{p},\\omega)$; in the vicinity of\n$\\mathbf{p}_K$ corresponding to the inter-conical points excitations it reads\nas\n$S(\\mathbf{p},\\omega)-S(\\mathbf{p}_K,\\omega)\\propto\\sqrt{\\omega^2-3J^2(\\mathbf{p}-\\mathbf{p}_K)^2}$.\n", "  The incorporation site of Er dopants inserted at high and low concentration\n(respectively 5 and 0.5 mol %) in nanoparticles of CaF 2 is studied by X-ray\nAbsorption Spectroscopy (XAS) at the Er L III edge. The experimental data are\ncompared with the results of structural modeling based on Density Functional\nTheory (DFT). DFT-based molecular dynamics is also used to simulate complete\ntheoretical EXAFS spectra of the model structures. The results is that Er\nsubstitutes for Ca in the structure and in the low concentration case the\ndopant ions are isolated. At high concentration the rare earth ions cluster\ntogether binding Ca vacancies.\n", "  We report the results of a statistical analysis of the space distribution of\ngalaxies within distances about 300 Mpc using the 2MRS catalog, which contains\nredshifts of 43533 galaxies of the 2MASS all-sky IR survey. Because of the\nunique features of the 2MRS survey, such as its 90 percent sky coverage, galaxy\nselection in the IR, the complete incorporation of the old stellar population\nof galaxies, weakness of the dust extinction effects, and the smallness of the\nk- and e-corrections allowed us to determine the statistical properties of the\nglobal distribution of galaxies in the Local Universe. We took into account the\nmain methodological factors that distort the theoretically expected relations\ncompared to those actually observed. We construct the radial galaxy number\ncounts N(R), SL(R, r) statistics, and the complete correlation function\n(conditional density) for volume-limited (VL) galaxy samples. The observed\nconditional density in the redshift space is independent of the luminosity of\ngalaxies and has the form of a power-law function with slope ~ 1.0 over a large\nrange scale-length spanning from 0.1 to 100 Mpc. We compare the statistical\nproperties of the space distribution of galaxies of the 2MRS catalog with the\ncorresponding properties of simulated catalogs: stochastic fractal\ndistributions and galaxies of the Millennium catalog.\n", "  We have obtained the highest resolution images available of TRAPPIST-1 using\nthe Gemini-South telescope and our speckle imaging camera. Observing at 692 and\n883 nm, we reached the diffraction limit of the telescope providing a best\nresolution of 27 mas or, at the distance of TRAPPIST-1, a spatial resolution of\n0.32 AU. Our imaging of the star extends from 0.32 to 14.5 AU. We show that to\na high confidence level, we can exclude all possible stellar and brown dwarf\ncompanions, indicating that TRAPPIST-1 is a single star.\n", "  Euclid is a space-based optical/near-infrared survey mission of the European\nSpace Agency (ESA) to investigate the nature of dark energy, dark matter and\ngravity by observing the geometry of the Universe and on the formation of\nstructures over cosmological timescales. Euclid will use two probes of the\nsignature of dark matter and energy: Weak gravitational Lensing, which requires\nthe measurement of the shape and photometric redshifts of distant galaxies, and\nGalaxy Clustering, based on the measurement of the 3-dimensional distribution\nof galaxies through their spectroscopic redshifts. The mission is scheduled for\nlaunch in 2020 and is designed for 6 years of nominal survey operations. The\nEuclid Spacecraft is composed of a Service Module and a Payload Module. The\nService Module comprises all the conventional spacecraft subsystems, the\ninstruments warm electronics units, the sun shield and the solar arrays. In\nparticular the Service Module provides the extremely challenging pointing\naccuracy required by the scientific objectives. The Payload Module consists of\na 1.2 m three-mirror Korsch type telescope and of two instruments, the visible\nimager and the near-infrared spectro-photometer, both covering a large common\nfield-of-view enabling to survey more than 35% of the entire sky. All sensor\ndata are downlinked using K-band transmission and processed by a dedicated\nground segment for science data processing. The Euclid data and catalogues will\nbe made available to the public at the ESA Science Data Centre.\n", "  The physical parameters of the retired A star HD 185351 were analysed in\ngreat detail by Johnson et al. (2014) using interferometry, spectroscopy and\nasteroseismology. Results from all independent methods are consistent with HD\n185351 having a mass in excess of $1.5\\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$. However, the study\nalso showed that not all observational constraints could be reconciled in\nstellar evolutionary models, leading to mass estimates ranging from $\\sim\n1.6-1.9\\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$ and casting doubts on the accuracy of stellar\nproperties determined from asteroseismology. Here we solve this discrepancy and\nconstruct a theoretical model in agreement with all observational constraints\non the physical parameters of HD 185351. The effects of varying input physics\nare examined as well as considering the additional constraint of the observed\ng-mode period spacing. This quantity is found to be sensitive to the inclusion\nof additional mixing from the convective core during the main sequence, and can\nbe used to calibrate the overshooting efficiency using low-luminosity red giant\nstars. A theoretical model with metallicity\n$\\left[\\mathrm{Fe/H}\\right]=0.16$dex, mixing-length parameter\n$\\alpha_{\\mathrm{MLT}}=2.00$, and convective overshooting efficiency parameter\n$f=0.030$ is found to be in complete agreement with all observational\nconstraints for a stellar mass of $M\\simeq1.60\\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$.\n", "  Bitter coil is an electromagnet used for the generation of exceptionally\nstrong magnetic fields. The upper bound of magnet flux density is restricted by\nseveral factors. One principal restriction is the high stresses due to Lorentz\nforces in the coil. The Lorentz forces generate the distributed body force,\nwhich acts as the pressure of magnetic field. The common radial thickness\nprofile of the Bitter coil is constant. In this paper the possibility of\noptimization by means of non-constant radial thickness profile of the Bitter\ncoil is studied. The close form expression for optimal thickness profile is\nobtained. Both designs are compared and the considerable improvement of\nmagnetic flux density is demonstrated. Moreover, the optimal design improves\nthe shape of cooling channels. Namely, the highest cross-section of cooling\nchannel is at the most thermally loaded inner surface of the coil.\n", "  We report the observations of nonstructural acousto-injection luminescence\n(NAIL) from tantalized LiNbO3 wafers. The samples under study are the X cut or\nY cut wafers with the silver paste electrodes on opposite surfaces. The\nthickness is 1 to 2 mm and other linear dimensions are in the range of 2 to 25\nmm. Experiments are done at room temperature in the MHz-frequency range. Mainly\nthe fundamental shear ultrasound modes are excited in the samples.\nExperimentally are measured the spectra of NAIL, photo-luminescence spectra,\nacousto-electric properties, X Ray diffraction under NAIL. The NAIL and other\neffects appear above certain threshold amplitude of the acoustical strain that\nis about 10E-5. The involvement of the microstructural non-uniformity in the\neffects observed is experimentally identified by the photo-luminescence of\npoint defects taken from different micro-regions of the samples. The data are\nexplained in terms of the considerable acoustic stresses and piezoelectric\nfields that are capable injecting charge carriers from the metal contacts into\na crystal.\n", "  Since Shannon proved that Gaussian distribution is the optimum for a linear\nchannel with additive white Gaussian noise and he calculated the corresponding\nchannel capacity, it remains the most applied distribution in optical\ncommunications while the capacity result is celebrated as the seminal linear\nShannon limit. Yet, when it is applied in nonlinear channels (e.g.\nfiber-optics) it has been shown to be non-optimum, yielding the same result as\nfor uncoded transmission in the high nonlinear regime. This has led to the\nnotion of nonlinear Shannon limit, which predicts vanishing capacity at high\nnonlinearity. However, recent findings indicate that non-Gaussian distribution\nmay lead to improved capacity estimations, urging for an exciting search for\nnovel methods in nonlinear optical communications. Here for the first time, we\nshow that it is possible to transmit information above the existing limits by\nusing a novel probabilistic shaping of the input signal, which we call ripple\ndistribution\n", "  I describe a possible scenario for the origin of proton mass in terms of\nCheshire Cat, half-skyrmions, topology change and interplay between hidden\nchiral-scale symmetry and induced local symmetry. This differs from the\nstandard constituent-quark scenario. As the baryonic matter density is\nincreased toward the vector manifestation (VM) fixed-point at which the $\\rho$\nmass is to vanish, the effective in-medium mass ratio $m^*_\\rho/m^*_N$ is to\ntend to zero proportionally to $g^*_\\rho$ where $g^*_\\rho$ is the in-medium\nhidden gauge coupling constant. I develop the thesis that the intricacy\ninvolved in the mass generation could be decoded from experiments at RIB\naccelerators and massive compact stars.\n", "  We propose an all-silicon multi-layer interference filter composed solely of\nsilicon with sub-wavelength structure (SWS) in order to realize high\nperformance optical filters operating in the THz frequency region with\nrobustness against cryogenic thermal cycling and mechanical damage. We\ndemonstrate fabrication of a three-layer prototype using well-established\ncommon micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) technologies as a first step\ntoward developing practical filters. The measured transmittance of the\nthree-layer filter agrees well with the theoretical transmittances calculated\nby a simple thin-film calculation with effective refractive indices as well as\na rigorous coupled-wave analysis simulation. We experimentally show that SWS\nlayers can work as homogeneous thin-film interference layers with effective\nrefractive indices even if there are multiple SWS layers in a filter.\n", "  We propose an extended version of quantum dynamics for a certain system S,\nwhose evolution is ruled by a Hamiltonian $H$, its initial conditions, and a\nsuitable set $\\rho$ of {\\em rules}, acting repeatedly on S. The resulting\ndynamics is not necessarily periodic or quasi-periodic, as one could imagine\nfor conservative systems with a finite number of degrees of freedom. In fact,\nit may have quite different behaviors depending on the explicit forms of $H$,\n$\\rho$ as well as on the initial conditions. After a general discussion on this\n$(H,\\rho)$-{\\em induced dynamics}, we apply our general ideas to extend the\nclassical game of life, and we analyze several aspects of this extension.\n", "  Use of lighter than air platforms (aerostats and airships) for reconnaissance\nand surveillance over long periods can be facilitated by generation of power\non-board through solar photovoltaic arrays. Attempts to integrate solar\nphotovoltaic modules on such contoured surfaces leads to multiple challenges\nranging from the choice of solar modules, determination of best method of their\nintegration with the lighter than air platform, and design of the array layout\nin order to optimize the loss of power due to non-uniform illumination. This\npaper describes the method of designing such a system and suggests strategies\nfor overcoming these challenges. The issue of non-uniform illumination has been\ntackled by maximum power point tracking using the scanning window technique for\nmaximizing power generation and an algorithm of distributed maximum power point\ntracking has been suggested for further improvement. The procedure described in\nthis paper can be used for obtaining the optimum power generation capability of\na solar photovoltaic array mounted on a lighter than air platform of a given\nvolume and payload carrying capability.\n", "  Social dilemmas concern a natural conflict between cooperation and self\ninterests among individuals in large populations. The emergence of cooperation\nand its maintenance is the key for the understanding of fundamental concepts\nabout the evolution of species. In order to understand the mechanisms involved\nin this framework, here we study the Optional Public Good Games with focus on\nthe effects of diffusive aspects in the emergent patterns of cyclic dominance\nbetween the strategies. Differently from other works, we showed that\nrock-paper-scissors (RPS) patterns occur by introducing a simple kind of random\nmobility in a lattice sparsely occupied. Such pattern has been revealed to be\nvery important in the conservation of the species in ecological and social\nenvironments. The goal of this paper is to show that we do not need more\nelaborated schemes for construction of the neighbourhood in the game to observe\nRPS patterns as suggested in the literature. As an interesting additional\nresult, in this contribution we also propose an alternative method to quantify\nthe RPS density in a quantitative context of the game theory which becomes\npossible to perform a finite size scaling study. Such approach can be very\ninteresting to be applied in other games generically.\n", "  Nematic quantum fluids with wavefunctions that break the underlying\ncrystalline symmetry can form in interacting electronic systems. We examine the\nquantum Hall states that arise in high magnetic fields from anisotropic hole\npockets on the Bi(111) surface. Spectroscopy performed with a scanning\ntunneling microscope shows that a combination of local strain and many-body\nCoulomb interactions lift the six-fold Landau level (LL) degeneracy to form\nthree valley-polarized quantum Hall states. We image the resulting anisotropic\nLL wavefunctions and show that they have a different orientation for each\nbroken-symmetry state. The wavefunctions correspond precisely to those expected\nfrom pairs of hole valleys and provide a direct spatial signature of a nematic\nelectronic phase.\n", "  In their recent paper [Nature Physics 15, 451 (2006)], Sakmann and Kasevich\nstudy the formation of fringe patterns in ultra-cold Bose gases and claim:\n`Here, we show how single shots can be simulated from numerical solutions of\nthe time-dependent many-body Schr\\\"odinger equation.' It would be remarkable if\nthey had solved this exponentially complex equation. Instead they solve\nnonlinear equations with the aim to approximate the solution of the\nSchr\\\"odinger equation. The authors proceed to criticize phase-space approaches\nto simulating quantum dynamics and claim the impossibility of interpreting\nsingle trajectories of the truncated Wigner (tW) method as single-shot\nexperimental outcomes. Here we aim to provide relevant context and elaborate\nwhy we disagree with the authors' claims.\n", "  This paper argues that non-self-adjoint operators can be observables. There\nare only four ways for this to occur: non-self-adjoint observables can either\nbe normal operators, or be symmetric, or have a real spectrum, or have none of\nthese three properties. I explore each of these four classes of observables,\narguing that the class of normal operators provides an equivalent formulation\nof quantum theory, whereas the other classes considerably extend it.\n", "  Supernova remnants are believed to be the sources of galactic cosmic rays.\nWithin this framework, diffusive shock acceleration must operate in these\nobjects and accelerate protons all the way up to PeV energies. To do so,\nsignificant amplification of the magnetic field at the shock is required. The\ngoal of this paper is to investigate the capability of supernova remnants to\naccelerate PeV protons. We present analytic estimates of the maximum energy of\naccelerated protons under various assumptions about the field amplification at\nsupernova remnant shocks. We show that acceleration up to PeV energies is\nproblematic in all the scenarios considered. This implies that either a\ndifferent (more efficient) mechanism of field amplification operates at\nsupernova remnant shocks, or that the sources of galactic cosmic rays in the\nPeV energy range should be searched somewhere else.\n", "  The Maxwell equations for an homogeneous medium in which electric currents\nare composed of Ohmic, diffusive and impressed currents are written in the\nstatic approximation in which displacements currents are neglected. Closed\nexact expressions are given for the solutions of the charge density, electric\nfield potential and the magnetic field intensity as functions of the impressed\ncurrents and densities. Also, approximate formulae for these magnitudes are\nderived. The solutions correctly reproduce the conclusions of a previous work\nin which the relevance of Yukawa like potentials determined by diffusion\neffects were identified. Within the approximate solutions, the effective\npotential generated by the impressed sources is given by the superposition of\nYukawa potentials created by the impressed charges concentrated in a given\nvolume element. This representation makes evident that at small spatial\nregions, the experimental detectors are able to measure spherically symmetrical\nsignals, indicating the presence of electric monopoles. The discussion also\nallows to argue that the magnetic field tomographic signal becomes completely\nindependent of the presence of diffusion in the medium. The analysis also\npermits to determine the range of space and temporal frequencies in which the\ndiffusion effects might become important in justifying the detection of\nmonopole signals.\n", "  Our knowledge of Saturns neutral thermosphere is far superior to that of the\nother giant planets due to Cassini Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrograph (UVIS)\nobservations of 15 solar occultations and 26 stellar occultations analyzed to\ndate. These measurements yield H2 as the dominant species with an upper limit\non the H mole fraction of 5 %. Inferred temperatures near the lower boundary\nare ~ 150 K, rising to an asymptotic value of ~ 400K at equatorial latitudes\nand increasing with latitude to polar values in the range of 550-600 K. The\nlatter is consistent with a total estimated auroral power input of ~ 10TW\ngenerating Joule and energetic particle heating of ~ 5-6TW that is more than an\norder of magnitude greater than solar EUV/FUV heating. This auroral heating\nwould be sufficient to solve the energy crisis of Saturns thermospheric\nheating, if it can be efficiently redistributed to low latitudes. The inferred\nstructure of the thermosphere yields poleward directed pressure gradients on\nequipotential surfaces consistent with auroral heating and poleward increasing\ntemperatures. A gradient wind balance aloft with these pressure gradients\nimplies westward, retrograde winds ~ 500 m/s or Mach number ~ 0.3 at\nmid-latitudes. The occultations reveal an expansion of the thermosphere peaking\nat or slightly after equinox, anti-correlated with solar activity, and\napparently driven by lower thermospheric heating of unknown cause. The He mole\nfraction remains unconstrained as no Cassini UVIS He 58.4 nm airglow\nmeasurements have been published.\n", "  We present \\Chandra\\ observations of 23 galaxy groups and low-mass galaxy\nclusters at $0.03<z<0.15$ with a median temperature of ~2keV. The sample is a\nstatistically complete flux-limited subset of the 400 deg$^2$ survey. We\ninvestigated the scaling relation between X-ray luminosity ($L$) and\ntemperature ($T$), taking selection biases fully into account. The logarithmic\nslope of the bolometric \\LT\\ relation was found to be $3.29\\pm0.33$, consistent\nwith values typically found for samples of more massive clusters. In\ncombination with other recent studies of the \\LT\\ relation we show that there\nis no evidence for the slope, normalisation, or scatter of the \\LT\\ relation of\ngalaxy groups being different than that of massive clusters. The exception to\nthis is that in the special case of the most relaxed systems, the slope of the\ncore-excised \\LT\\ relation appears to steepen from the self-similar value found\nfor massive clusters to a steeper slope for the lower mass sample studied here.\nThanks to our rigorous treatment of selection biases, these measurements\nprovide a robust reference against which to compare predictions of models of\nthe impact of feedback on the X-ray properties of galaxy groups.\n", "  Mesoscale forecasts are now routinely performed as elements of operational\nforecasts and their outputs do appear convincing. However, despite their\nrealistic appearance at times the comparison to observations is less favorable.\nAt the grid scale these forecasts often do not compare well with observations.\nThis is partly due to the chaotic system underlying the weather. Another key\nproblem is that it is impossible to evaluate the risk of making decisions based\non these forecasts because they do not provide a measure of confidence.\nEnsembles provide this information in the ensemble spread and quartiles.\nHowever, running global ensembles at the meso or sub mesoscale involves\nsubstantial computational resources. National centers do run such ensembles,\nbut the subject of this publication is a method which requires significantly\nless computation. The ensemble enhanced mesoscale system presented here aims\nnot at the creation of an improved mesoscale forecast model. Also it is not to\ncreate an improved ensemble system. Here an ensemble is created from one\nmesoscale forecast with the aim of interrogating the probabilities of the\nforecast. The diagnostics developed in this publication is the generation of\nthe confidence intervals via cumulative probability density functions (pdf),\ndetection of extrema and selective ensembles. The subject of this publication\nis the analysis of those diagnostics, their dependence on the domain size of\nthe ensemble and the number of ensemble members. The analysis strategies\nintroduced are termed: subgrid ensemble enhanced mesoscale forecast, extreme\nvalue analysis of the ensemble pdf and observation constrained ensemble\nforecast.\n", "  We consider the goal of predicting how complex networks respond to chronic\n(press) perturbations when characterizations of their network topology and\ninteraction strengths are associated with uncertainty. Our primary result is\nthe derivation of exact formulas for the expected number and probability of\nqualitatively incorrect predictions about a system's responses under\nuncertainties drawn form arbitrary distributions of error. These formulas\nobviate the current use of simulations, algorithms, and qualitative modeling\ntechniques. Additional indices provide new tools for identifying which links in\na network are most qualitatively and quantitatively sensitive to error, and for\ndetermining the volume of errors within which predictions will remain\nqualitatively determinate (i.e. sign insensitive). Together with recent\nadvances in the empirical characterization of uncertainty in ecological\nnetworks, these tools bridge a way towards probabilistic predictions of network\ndynamics.\n", "  Griffiths [Phys. Rev. A 94, 032115 (2016)] analyzed, in the framework of\nconsistent histories interpretation, the controversy regarding the approach to\nthe past of a quantum particle introduced by Vaidman [Phys. Rev. A 87, 052104\n(2013)]. I argue that Griffith's criticism of my approach using analysis of\nexperiments with weak probes is unfounded.\n", "  We present combined experimental and theoretical investigations on the\nmagnetic and magnetocaloric behavior of Nd$_2$NiMnO$_6$. The relative cooling\npower (RCP) which quantifies the usefulness of a magnetocaloric (MC) material\nis estimated to be $\\approx 300$ J/Kg near the ferromagnetic transition at $T_C\n\\approx 195$ K. This RCP is comparable to the best known MC materials.\nAdditionally, the magnetic entropy change has a broad profile ($T_C - 50~{\\rm\nK} < T < T_C + 50~{\\rm K}$) leading to an enhancement in the working-range of\ntemperatures for magnetocaloric based cooling. These features make\nNd$_2$NiMnO$_6$ a superior magnetocaloric material compared for example, to the\nnonmagnetic counterpart Y$_2$NiMnO$_6$. We identify the mechanism for the\nenhanced RCP which can guide search for future MC materials.\n", "  The role of surface tension and wettability in the dynamics of air-liquid\ninterfaces during immiscible fluid displacement flows in capillary tube driven\nby pressure has been investigated. The contact angle and capillary number drive\nthe force wetting processes which is controlled by the balance between the\ncapillary and the viscous lubrication forces. The dynamic wetting condition\nwith the critical capillary number is studied analytically and validated\nexperimentally, which demonstrates that the critical capillary number is\nassociated with the contact angle, slip length and capillary radius.\n", "  Experimental excitation functions for long-lived products in proton induced\nreactions were measured with the activation method in the 37-65 MeV energy\nrange on natural holmium. Stacked foil irradiation technique and high\nresolution gamma spectrometry were used in order to measure cross-section data\nfor the production of $^{161}$Er, $^{160}$Er and $^{159,157}$Dy. For comparison\nof the production routes of medically related $^{161}$Er and $^{160}$Er\nradioisotopes new experimental cross section data were deduced for the\n$^{162}$Er(p,x)$^{161,160}$Er and $^{162}$Er(d,x)$^{161,160}$Er reactions by\nre-evaluating gamma-ray spectra from earlier measurements. No earlier data were\nfound in the literature for these reactions. The experimental data are compared\nwith results of TALYS theoretical code reported in TENDL-2015.\n", "  In many interacting particle systems, tagged particles move diffusively upon\nsubtracting a drift. General techniques to prove such `invariance principles'\nare available for reversible processes (Kipnis-Varadhan) and for non-reversible\nprocesses in dimension $d>2$. The interest of our paper is that it considers a\nnon-reversible one-dimensional process: the Toom model. The reason that we can\nprove the invariance principle is that in this model, push-tagged particles\nmove manifestly slower than second-class particles.\n", "  Purpose: To explore the usability and normal T1rho value of liver parenchyma\nwith a novel single breathhold black blood single shot fast spin echo\nacquisition based liver imaging sequence. Materials and Methods: In total 19\nhealth subjects (10 males, 9 females; mean age: 37.4 yrs; range: 23-54 yrs)\nparticipated in the study. 11 subjects had liver scanned twice in the same\nsession to access scan-rescan repeatability. 12 subjects had liver scanned\ntwice in two sessions with 7-10 days' interval to access scan-rescan\nreproducibility. MR was performed with a 3.0 T scanner with dual transmitter.\nThe MR sequence allows simultaneous acquisition of 4 spin lock times (TSLs:\n0ms, 10 ms, 30 ms, 50ms) in 10 second. Inherent black blood effect of fast spin\necho and double inversion recovery were utilized to achieve blood signal\nsuppression. Results: The technique demonstrated good image quality and minimal\nartifacts. For liver parenchyma, Bland-Altman plot showed the scan-rescan\nrepeatability mean difference was 0.025 ms (95% limits of agreement: -1.163 to\n1.213 ms), and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was 0.977. The\nscan-rescan reproducibility mean difference was -0.075 ms (95% limits of\nagreement: -3.280 to 3.310 ms), and ICC was 0.820 which is better than the ICC\nof 0.764 of a previous bright blood multi-breath hold gradient echo acquisition\ntechnique. The liver T1rho value was 39.9 +/- 2.4 ms (range: 36.1 - 44.2 ms),\nwhich is lower than the value of 42.8=/-2.1 ms acquired with the previous\nbright blood technique. Conclusion: This study validated the application of a\nsingle breathhold black blood single shot fast spin echo acquisition based for\nhuman liver T1rho imaging. The lower liver parenchyma T1rho value and higher\nscan rescan reproducibility may improve of the sensitivity of this technique.\n", "  Complex and Hermitian structures on hom-Lie algebras are introduced and some\nexamples of these structures are presented. Also, it is shown that there not\nexists a proper complex (Hermitian) home-Lie algebra of dimension two. Then\nusing a hom-left symmetric algebra, a phase space is provided and then a\ncomplex structure on it, is presented. Finally, the notion of Kahler hom-Lie\nalgebra is introduced and then using a Kahler hom-Lie algebra, a phase space is\nconstructed.\n", "  Hartree--Fock theory is one of the most ancient methods of computational\nchemistry, but up to the present day quantum chemical calculations on\nHartree--Fock level or with hybrid density functional theory can be excessively\ntime consuming.\n  We compare three currently available techniques to reduce the computational\ndemands of such calculations in terms of timing and accuracy.\n", "  Collective animal movements produce spectacular natural phenomena that arise\nfrom simple local interactions among group members. Flocks of homing pigeons,\nColumba livia, provide a useful model for the study of collective motion and\ndecision making. During homing flights, flock members are forced to resolve\npotentially divergent navigational preferences in order to stay together and\nbenefit from flying in a group. Recent work has demonstrated that some\nindividuals consistently contribute more to the movement decisions of the flock\nthan others do, thereby generating stable hierarchical leader/follower\nnetworks. Yet, what attributes of a flying pigeon reliably predict leadership\nremains an open question. We examined the flexibility of an individual's\nhierarchical leadership rank (i.e. its ordinal position when flock members are\nranked according to the average time differences with which they lead or follow\nothers) as a function of changes in its navigational knowledge. We manipulated\nalready established hierarchical networks in three different flocks, by\nproviding certain individuals with additional homing experience. We found that\nsuch training did not consistently lead to an increase in birds' leadership\nranks, and that, in general, the nature of leader/follower interactions between\ntrained and untrained birds remained unaffected. Thus, leadership hierarchies\nin pigeon flocks appear resistant to changes in the navigational knowledge of a\nsubset of their members, at least when these changes are relatively small. We\ndiscuss the implications of our results in light of the potential benefits of\nstructural stability in decision-making networks.\n", "  We investigate, within the type-II two-Higgs-doublet extension of the\nstandard model (SM), the impact of heavy neutral Higgs boson resonances with\nunsuppressed Yukawa couplings to top quarks on top-quark pair production at the\nLHC at next-to-leading order (NLO) in the strong coupling constant. We take\ninto account the resonant Higgs boson contributions, the non-resonant SM\n$t\\bar{t}$ continuum and the interference of these two contributions. The NLO\nQCD corrections to heavy Higgs production and the interference contributions\nare calculated in the large top-quark mass ($m_t$) limit, including an\neffective K-factor rescaling. Our evaluation of the QCD-Higgs interference is\nfocused on the Higgs resonance region. Using representative CP-conserving as\nwell as CP-violating parameter scenarios phenomenological results are presented\nfor different observables.\n", "  With the intriguing properties of diffraction-free, self-accelerating, and\nself-healing, Airy plasmons are promising to be used in the trapping,\ntransporting, and sorting of micro-objects, imaging, and chip scale signal\nprocessing. However, the high dissipative loss and the lack of dynamical\nsteerability restrict the implementation of Airy plasmons in these\napplications. Here we reveal the hybrid Airy plasmons for the first time by\ntaking a hybrid graphene-based plasmonic waveguide in the terahertz (THz)\ndomain as an example. Due to the coupling between an optical mode and a\nplasmonic mode, the hybrid Airy plasmons can have large propagation lengths and\neffective transverse deflections, where the transverse waveguide confinements\nare governed by the hybrid modes with moderate quality factors. Meanwhile, the\npropagation trajectories of hybrid Airy plasmons are dynamically steerable by\nchanging the chemical potential of graphene. These hybrid Airy plasmons may\npromote the further discovery of non-diffracting beams with the emerging\ndevelopments of optical tweezers and tractor beams.\n", "  We perform a benchmark study of the step scaling procedure for the ratios of\nrenormalization constants extracted from position space correlation functions.\nWe work in the quenched approximation and consider the pseudoscalar, scalar,\nvector and axial vector bilinears. The pseudoscalar/scalar cases allow us to\nobtain the non-perturbative running of the quark mass over a wide range of\nenergy scales - from around 17 GeV to below 1.5 GeV - which agrees well with\nthe 4-loop prediction of continuum perturbation theory. We find that step\nscaling is feasible in X-space and we discuss its advantages and potential\nproblems.\n", "  PicSat is a nanosatellite currently being developed to observe the transit of\nthe giant planet \\b{eta} Pictoris, expected some time between July 2017 and\nJune 2018. The mission is based on a Cubesat architecture, with a small but\nambitious 2 kg opto-mechanical payload specifically designed for high precision\nphotometry. The satellite will be launched in early 2017, probably on a 600 km\nSun synchronous orbit. The main objective of the mission is the constant\nmonitoring of the brightness of Pic at an unprecedented combination of\nreliability and precision (200 ppm per hour, with interruptions of at most 30\nminutes) to finely characterize the transiting exoplanet and detect exocomets\nin the Pictoris system. To achieve this difficult objective, the payload is\ndesigned with a 3.5 cm effective aperture telescope which injects the light in\na single-mode optical fiber linked to an avalanche photodioode. A two-axis\npiezoelectric actuation system, driven by a tailor-made feedback loop control\nalgorithm, is used to lock the fiber on the center of the star in the focal\nplane. These actuators complement the attitude determination and control system\nof the satellite to maintain the sub-arcsecond pointing accuracy required to\nreach the excellent level of photometric precision. Overall, the mission raises\nmultiple very difficult challenges: high temperature stability of the avalanche\ndetector (achieved with a thermoelectric colling device), high pointing\naccuracy and stability, and short timeframe for the development.\n", "  We study supersymmetric extension of the Einstein-aether gravitational model\nwhere local Lorentz invariance is broken down to the subgroup of spatial\nrotations by a vacuum expectation value of a timelike vector field. By\nrestricting to the level of linear perturbations around Lorentz-violating\nvacuum and using the superfield formalism we construct the most general action\ninvariant under the linearized supergravity transformations. We show that,\nunlike its non-supersymmetric counterpart, the model contains only a single\nfree dimensionless parameter, besides the usual dimensionful gravitational\ncoupling. This makes the model highly predictive. An analysis of the spectrum\nof physical excitations reveal superluminal velocity of gravitons. The latter\nproperty leads to the extension of the gravitational multiplet by additional\nfermonic and bosonic states with helicities $\\pm 3/2$ and $\\pm 1$. We outline\nthe observational constraints on the model following from its low-energy\nphenomenology.\n", "  Hilbert-Schmidt (HS) decompositions and Frobenius norms are used to analyze\nbiseparability of 3-qubit systems, with particular emphasis on density matrices\nwith maximally disordered subsystems (MDS) and on the W state mixed with white\nnoise. The biseparable form of a MDS density matrix is obtained by using the\nBell states of a 2-qubit subsystem, multiplied by density matrices of the third\nqubit, which include the relevant HS parameters. Using our methods a sufficient\ncondition and explicit biseparability of the W state mixed with white noise are\ngiven. They are compared with the sufficient condition for explicit full\nseparability given in a previous work.\n", "  In this paper we qualitatively analyse quadratically damped oscillators with\nnon-linear restoring force. In particular, we obtain Hamiltonian structure and\nanalytical form of the energy functions.\n", "  This paper describes an alternative method of charged hyperon reconstruction\napplicable to the LHCb experiment. It extends the seminal work of the FOCUS\ncollaboration to the specific detector layout of LHCb and addresses the\nreconstruction ambiguities reported in their earlier work, leading to\nimprovements in the reconstruction efficiency for the specific cases of Xi- and\nOmega- baryon decays to a charged meson and a Lambda baryon.\n", "  We associate tape casting and magnetron sputtering techniques to engineer\nflexible nanostructures using ZrO$_2$ green tape as substrate. We\nsystematically investigate the structural, magnetic and electrical properties\nof NiFe/Cr/NiFe trilayer nanostructures, with variable thickness values of the\nNiFe and Cr layers, grown onto rigid glass and flexible ZrO$_2$ tape\nsubstrates. We verify the mirroring of these properties in the trilayer\nnanostructures, irrespective on the kind of employed substrate. The fact that\nthe trilayer nanostructures can be reproduced in distinct substrates\ncorresponds to an important advance for their applicability. The results place\nthe ZnO$_2$ green tape as an attractive candidate for application as low-cost\nflexible substrate in the development of electrical and magnetic sensor\nelements with high sensitivity to mechanic stress.\n", "  Classification of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) into groups has been intensively\nstudied by various statistical tests in previous years. It has been suggested\nthat there was a distinct group of GRBs, beyond the long and short ones, with\nintermediate durations. However, such a group is not securely confirmed yet.\nStrangely, concerning the spectral hardness, the observations from the Swift\nand RHESSI satellites give different results. For the Swift/BAT database it is\nfound that the intermediate-duration bursts might well be related to so-called\nX-ray flashes (XRFs). On the other hand, for the RHESSI dataset the\nintermediate-duration bursts seem to be spectrally too hard to be given by\nXRFs. The connection of the intermediate-duration bursts and XRFs for the BATSE\ndatabase is not clear as well. The purpose of this article is to check the\nrelation between XRFs and GRBs for the BATSE and RHESSI databases,\nrespectively. We use an empirical definition of XRFs introduced by other\nauthors earlier. For the RHESSI database we also use a transformation between\nthe detected counts and the fluences based on the simulated detector response\nfunction. The purpose is to compare the hardnesses of GRBs with the definition\nof XRFs. There is a 1.3-4.2 % fraction of XRFs in the whole BATSE database. The\nvast majority of the BATSE short bursts are not XRFs because only 0.7-5.7 % of\nthe short bursts can be given by XRFs. However, there is a large uncertainty in\nthe fraction of XRFs among the intermediate-duration bursts. The fraction of\n1-85 % of the BATSE intermediate-duration bursts can be related to XRFs. For\nthe long bursts this fraction is between 1.0 % and 3.4 %. The uncertainties in\nthese fractions are large, however it can be claimed that all BATSE\nintermediate-duration bursts cannot be given by XRFs. At least 79 % of RHESSI\nshort bursts, at least 53 % of RHESSI intermediate-duration bursts, and at\nleast...\n", "  Noise characterization in MRI has multiple applications, including quality\nassurance and protocol optimization. It is particularly important in the\npresence of parallel imaging acceleration, where the noise distribution can\ncontain severe spatial heterogeneities. If the parallel imaging reconstruction\nis a linear process, an exact noise analysis is possible by taking into account\nthe correlations between all the samples involved. However, for k-space based\ntechniques like GRAPPA, the exact analysis has been considered computationally\nprohibitive due to the very large size of the noise covariance matrices\nrequired to characterize the noise propagation from k-space to image-space.\nPrevious methods avoid this computational burden by approximating the GRAPPA\nreconstruction as a pixel-wise linear operation performed in the image-space.\nHowever, these methods are not exact in the presence of non-uniform k-space\nundersampling (e.g.: containing a calibration region). For this reason, in this\nwork we develop an exact characterization of the noise distribution for\nself-calibrated parallel imaging in the presence of arbitrary Cartesian\nundersampling patterns. By exploiting the symmetries and separability in the\nnoise propagation process, the proposed method is computationally efficient and\ndoes not require large matrices. In this manuscript, we present the proposed\nnoise characterization method and compare it to previous techniques using\nMonte-Carlo simulations as well as phantom acquisitions.\n", "  The slow dynamics in a glassy hard-sphere system is dominated by cage\nbreaking events, i.e., rearrangements where a particle escapes from the cage\nformed by its neighboring particles. We study such events for an overdamped\ncolloidal system by the means of Brownian dynamics simulations. While it is\ndifficult to relate cage breaking events to structural mean field results in\nbulk, we show that the microscopic dynamics of particles close to a wall can be\nrelated to the anisotropic two-particle density. In particular, we study\ncage-breaking trajectories, mean forces on a tracked particle, and the impact\nof the history of trajectories. Based on our simulation results, we further\nconstruct two different one-particle random-walk models - one without and one\nwith memory incorporated - and find the local anisotropy and the\nhistory-dependence of particles as crucial ingredients to describe the escape\nfrom a cage. Finally, our detailed study of a rearrangement event close to a\nwall not only reveals the memory effect of cages, but leads to a deeper insight\ninto the fundamental mechanisms of glassy dynamics.\n", "  We prove that for any convex globally hyperbolic maximal (GHM) anti-de Sitter\n(AdS) 3-dimensional space-time $N$ with particles (cone singularities of angles\nless than $\\pi$ along time-like curves), the complement of the convex core in\n$N$ admits a unique foliation by constant Gauss curvature surfaces. This\nextends, and provides a new proof of, a result of \\cite{BBZ2}. We also describe\na parametrization of the space of convex GHM AdS metrics on a given manifold,\nwith particles of given angles, by the product of two copies of the\nTeichm\\\"uller space of hyperbolic metrics with cone singularities of fixed\nangles. Finally, we use the results on $K$-surfaces to extend to hyperbolic\nsurfaces with cone singularities of angles less than $\\pi$ a number of results\nconcerning landslides, which are smoother analogs of earthquakes sharing some\nof their key properties.\n", "  We model the energy dependence of a quasi periodic oscillation (QPOs)\nproduced by Lense-Thirring precession of a hot inner flow. We use a fully\n3-dimensional Monte-Carlo code to compute the Compton scattered flux produced\nby the hot inner flow intercepting seed photons from an outer truncated\nstandard disc. The changing orientation of the precessing torus relative to the\nline of sight produces the observed modulation of the X-ray flux.\n  We consider two scenarios of precession. First, we assume that the precession\naxis is perpendicular to the plane of the outer disc. In this scenario the\nrelative geometry of the cold disc and the hot torus does not change during\nprecession, so the emitted spectrum does not change, and the modulation is\nsolely due to the changing viewing angle. In the second scenario the precession\naxis is tilted with respect to the outer disc plane. This leads to changes in\nthe relative geometry of the hot flow and cold plasma, possibly resulting in\nvariations of the plasma temperature and thus generating additional spectral\nvariability, which combines with the variations due to the viewing angle\nchanges.\n", "  In this work the author derives the Galilean limit of the gravity obtained by\nusing the quantum hydrodynamic approach. The result shows that the quantum\ninteraction generates, in the weak gravity limit, a non zero contribution. The\nwork calculates the small deviation from the Newotion law due to the quantum\neffects on gravity and analyzes the experimental features to validate, on heart\nlaboratories, the theoretical model. The paper shows that this contribution\nexplain the observation of the motion of the galaxies.\n", "  We begin with a description of spacetime by a 4-dimensional cubic lattice\n$\\sscript$. It follows from this framework that the the speed of light is the\nonly nonzero instantaneous speed for a particle. The dual space $\\sscripthat$\ncorresponds to a cubic lattice of energy-momentum. This description implies\nthat there is a discrete set of possible particle masses. We then define\ndiscrete scalar quantum fields on $\\sscript$. These fields are employed to\ndefine interaction Hamiltonians and scattering operators. Although the\nscattering operator $S$ cannot be computed exactly, approximations are\npossible. Whether $S$ is unitary is an unsolved problem. Besides the\ndefinitions of these operators, our main assumption is conservation of\nenergy-momentum for a scattering process. This article concludes with various\nexamples of perturbation approximations. These include simplified versions of\nelectron-electron and electron-proton scattering as well as simple decay\nprocesses. We also define scattering cross-sections, decay rates and lifetimes\nwithin this formalism.\n", "  The reliable prediction of optical and fundamental gaps of finite size\nsystems using density functional theory requires to account for the potential\nself-interaction error, which is notorious for degrading the description of\ncharge transfer transitions. One solution is provided by parameterized\nlong-range corrected functionals such as LC-BLYP, which can be tuned such as to\ndescribe certain properties of the particular system at hand. Here, bare and\n3-mercaptoprotionic acid covered \\ce{Cd33Se33} quantum dots are investigated\nusing the optimally tuned LC-BLYP functional. The range separation parameter,\nwhich determines the switching on of the exact exchange contribution is found\nto be 0.12 bohr$^{-1}$ and 0.09 bohr$^{-1}$ for the bare and covered quantum\ndot, respectively. It is shown that density functional optimization indeed\nyields optical and fundamental gaps and thus exciton binding energies,\nconsiderably different compared with standard functionals such as the popular\nPBE and B3LYP ones. This holds true, despite the fact that the leading\ntransitions are localized on the quantum dot and do not show pronounced\nlong-range charge transfer character.\n", "  This work demonstrated two different kinds of magneto-transport behaviors in\nepitaxial $L1_{0}$ MnAl film as a function of temperature. The\nmagneto-resistance ratio (MR) was negative and exhibited evident enhancement in\nthe resistivity at coercive fields above 175 K. The MR enhancement was\nattributed to the increase of the magnetic domain walls based on the\nquantitative correlation between the domain density and the resistivity. Below\n175 K, the MR was positive and showed a quadratic dependence on the external\nmagnetic field, which implied that the MR was dominated by Lorentz effects.\n", "  This study deals with the investigation of MHD flow of Williamson fluid over\nan infinite rotating disk with the effects of Soret, Dufour, and anisotropic\nslip. The anisotropic slip and the Soret and Dufour effects are the primary\nfeatures of this study, which greatly influence the flow, heat and mass\ntransport properties. In simultaneous appearance of heat and mass transfer in a\nmoving fluid, the mass flux generated by temperature gradients is known as the\nthermal-diffusion or Soret effect and the energy flux created by a composition\ngradient is called the diffusion-thermo or Dufour effect, however, difference\nin slip lengths in streamwise and spanwise directions is named as anisotropic\nslip. The system of nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs), which\ngoverns the flow, heat and mass transfer characteristics, is transformed into\nordinary differential equations (ODEs) with the help of von K\\'arm\\'an\nsimilarity transformation. A numerical solution of the complicated ODEs is\ncarried out by a MATLAB routine bvp4c. The obtained results of velocity,\ntemperature, concentration, and some physical quantities are displayed through\ngraphs and tables, and their physical discussion is presented.\n", "  Overlaying commensurate optical lattices with various configurations called\nsuperlattices can lead to exotic lattice topologies and, in turn, a discovery\nof novel physics. In this study, by overlapping the maxima of lattices, a new\nisolated structure is created, while the interference of minima can generate\nvarious \"sublattice\" patterns. Three different kinds of primitive lattices are\nused to demonstrate isolated square, triangular, and hexagonal \"sublattice\"\nstructures in a two-dimensional optical superlattice, the patterns of which can\nbe manipulated dynamically by tuning the polarization, frequency, and intensity\nof laser beams. In addition, we propose the method of altering the relative\nphase to adjust the tunneling amplitudes in \"sublattices.\"\n  Our configurations provide unique opportunities to study particle\nentanglement in \"lattices\" formed by intersecting wells and to implement\nspecial quantum logic gates in exotic lattice geometries.\n", "  We report the colloidal synthesis of strongly fluorescent CsPbBr3 perovskite\nnanowires (NWs) with rectangular section and with tuneable width, from 20 nm\n(exhibiting no quantum confinement, hence emitting in the green) down to around\n3 nm (in the strong quan-tum-confinement regime, emitting in the blue), by\nintroducing in the synthesis a short acid (octanoic acid or hexanoic acid)\ntogether with alkyl amines (octylamine and oleylamine). Temperatures below 70\n{\\deg}C promoted the formation of monodisperse, few unit cell thick NWs that\nwere free from byproducts. The photoluminescence quantum yield of the NW\nsamples went from 12% for non-confined NWs emitting at 524 nm to a maximum of\n77% for the 5 nm diameter NWs emitting at 497 nm, down to 30% for the thinnest\nNWs (diameter ~ 3nm), in the latter sample most likely due to aggregation\noccurring in solution.\n", "  TiSe2 is a member of transition metal dichalcogenide family of layered\nvan-der-Waals materials that exhibits some distinctive electronic and optical\nproperties. Here, we perform Raman spectroscopy studies on single crystal TiSe2\nto investigate photon-induced defects associated with formation of selenium\nvacancies. Two additional Eg phonon peaks are observed in the laser-irradiated\nregions, consistent with Raman spectra of selenium deficient TiSe2. Temperature\ndependent studies of the threshold laser intensity necessary to form selenium\nvacancies show that there is a linear dependence. We extract the relevant\nactivation energy for selenium vacancy nucleation. The impact of these results\non the properties of strongly correlated electron states in TiSe2 are\ndiscussed.\n", "  Static mechanical properties (e.g. elastic modulus) and fatigue properties of\na material all have dispersions. Material inhomogeneity (it can be\ncharacterized well by the dispersion of elastic modulus) is the internal factor\nof dispersions of fatigue properties and the dispersion of the load is the\nexternal factor. In this paper, according to theoretical derivation and\npreliminary experiments verification, the following relationships between\ndispersions of fatigue properties and dispersions of static mechanical\nproperties of a material are obtained: the dispersion of fatigue life is n (the\nfatigue index) times of the sum of the dispersion of elastic modulus and the\ndispersion of the load. The corresponding dispersion of fatigue life is a\ndecreasing function of the given fatigue strength in the stage of high cycle\nfatigue; P-S curve (the probability statistical distribution of fatigue\nstrength) under the given fatigue life cannot be directly by test, but P-S\ncurve can be obtained on the bias of P-N curve (the probability statistical\ndistribution of fatigue life), and the corresponding dispersion of fatigue\nstrength is a decreasing function of the given fatigue life. On bias of\nconclusions above, not only the inhomogeneity of material but also the\ndispersion of the load needs to be considered in the fatigue design, especially\nin high cycle fatigue design.\n", "  We study the effect of thermal noise on the propagation speed of a planar\nflame. We show that this out of equilibrium greatly amplifies the effect of\nthermal noise to yield macroscopic reductions in the flame speed over what is\npredicted by the noise-free model. Computations show that noise slows the flame\nsignificantly. The flame is modeled using Navier Stokes equations with\nappropriate diffusive transport terms and chemical kinetic mechanism of\nhydrogen/oxygen. Thermal noise is modeled within the continuum framework using\na system of stochastic partial differential equations, with transport noise\nfrom fluctuating hydrodynamics and reaction noise from a poisson model. We use\na full chemical kinetics model in order to get quantitatively meaningful\nresults. We compute steady and dynamic flames using an operator split finite\nvolume scheme. New characteristic boundary conditions avoid non-physical\nboundary layers at computational boundaries. New limiters prevent stochastic\nterms from introducing non-physical negative concentrations. This represents\nthe first computation of a model with thermal noise is a system with this\ndegree of physical detail.\n", "  In the last decade, the relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) modelling of\npulsar wind nebulae, and of the Crab nebula in particular, has been highly\nsuccessful, with many of the observed dynamical and emission properties\nreproduced down to the finest detail. Here, we critically discuss the results\nof some of the most recent studies: namely the investigation of the origin of\nthe radio emitting particles and the quest for the acceleration sites of\nparticles of different energies along the termination shock, by using wisps\nmotion as a diagnostic tool; the study of the magnetic dissipation process in\nhigh magnetization nebulae by means of new long-term three-dimensional\nsimulations of the pulsar wind nebula evolution; the investigation of the\nrelativistic tearing instability in thinning current sheets, leading to fast\nreconnection events that might be at the origin of the Crab nebula gamma-ray\nflares.\n", "  We demonstrate that the use of on-shell methods, involving calculation of the\ndiscontinuity across the t-channel cut associated with the exchange of a pair\nof massless particles, can be used to evaluate loop contributions to both the\nelectromagnetic and gravitational scattering of massive systems. In the\ngravitational case, the use of factorization permits a straightforward and\nalgebraic calculation of higher order scattering results, which were obtained\npreviously by much more arduous Feynman diagram techniques.\n", "  Using Chandra ACIS-S, we have obtained imaging Xray spectrophotometry of the\nPluto system in support of the New Horizons flyby on 14 July 2015. 174 ksec of\nobservations were obtained on 4 visits in Feb 2014 to Aug 2015. We measured a\nnet signal of 6.8 counts and a noise level of 1.2 counts in a comoving 11 x 11\npixel box (100 x 100 R_Pluto) in the 0.31 to 0.60 keV passband for a detection\nat > 99.95 C.L. The Pluto photons do not match the background spectrum, are\ncoincident with a 90% flux aperture comoving with Pluto, and are not sky source\nconfused. The mean 0.31 to 0.60 keV Xray power from Pluto is 200 MW, in the\nmidrange of Xray power levels seen for known solar system emission sources:\nauroral precipitation, solar Xray scattering, and charge exchange (CXE) between\nsolar wind (SW) ions & atmospheric neutrals. We eliminate auroral effects as a\nsource, as Pluto has no known magnetic field & the New Horizons Alice UV\nspectrometer detected no airglow from Pluto during the flyby. Nano-scale\natmospheric haze particles could lead to enhanced resonant scattering of solar\nX-rays from Pluto, but the energy signature of the detected photons does not\nmatch the solar spectrum and estimates of Plutos scattered Xray emission are >\n100 times below the 3.9e-5 cps found in our observations. CXE emission from SW\ncarbon, nitrogen, and oxygen ions can produce the energy signature seen, and\nthe 6e25 neutral gas escape rate from Pluto deduced from New Horizons data can\nsupport the 3.0e24 Xray photons/sec emission rate required by our observations.\nUsing the SW proton density and speed measured by the Solar Wind Around Pluto\n(SWAP) instrument in the vicinity of Pluto at the time of the photon emissions,\nwe find too few SW minor ions flowing into the 11 x 11 pixel box centered on\nPluto than are needed to support the observed emission rate unless the SW is\nsignificantly focused and enhanced in this region.\n", "  The goal of the present paper is to obtain new free field realizations of\naffine Kac-Moody algebras motivated by geometric representation theory for\ngeneralized flag manifolds of finite-dimensional semisimple Lie groups. We\nprovide an explicit construction of a large class of irreducible modules\nassociated with certain parabolic subalgebras covering all known special cases.\n", "  The conformational properties of flexible and semiflexible polymers exposed\nto active noise are studied theoretically. The noise may originate from the\ninteraction of the polymer with surround- ing active (Brownian) particles or\nfrom the inherent motion of the polymer itself, which may be composed of active\nBrownian particles. In the latter case, the respective monomers are indepen-\ndently propelled in directions changing diffusively. For the description of the\npolymer, we adopt the continuous Gaussian semiflexible polymer model.\nSpecifically, the finite polymer extensibility is taken into account which\nturns out to be essentially for the polymer conformations. Our analytical\ncalculations predict a strong dependence of the relaxation times on the\nactivity. In particular, semi- flexible polymers exhibit a crossover from a\nbending-elasticity-dominated to the flexible-polymer dynamics with increasing\nactivity. This leads to a significant noise-induced polymer shrinkage over a\nlarge range of self-propulsion velocities. For large activities, the polymers\nswell and their extension becomes comparable to the contour length. The scaling\nproperties of the mean square end-to-end distance with respect to the polymer\nlength and monomer activity are discussed.\n", "  In this paper, we analyse the effect of the expansion of the universe on the\nclustering of galaxies. We evaluate the configurational integral for\ninteracting system of galaxies in an expanding universe by including effects\nproduced by the cosmological constant. The gravitational partition function is\nobtained using this configuration integral. Thermodynamic quantities,\nspecifically, Helmholtz free energy, entropy, internal energy, pressure and\nchemical potential are also derived for this system. It is observed that they\ndepend on the modified clustering parameter for this system of galaxies. It is\nalso demonstrated that these thermodynamical quantities get corrected because\nof the cosmological constant.\n", "  Utilizing the excellent stability of the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI),\nwe characterize both short-term (solar rotation) and long-term (solar cycle)\nchanges of the solar spectral irradiance (SSI) between 265-500 nm during the\non-going Cycle 24. We supplement the OMI data with concurrent observations from\nthe GOME-2 and SORCE instruments and find fair-to-excellent, depending on\nwavelength, agreement among the observations and predictions of the NRLSSI2 and\nSATIRE-S models.\n", "  In the last years new interdisciplinary approaches to economics and social\nscience have been developed. A Thermodynamic approach to socio-economics has\nbrought to a new interdisciplinary scientific field called econophysics. Why\nthermodynamic? Thermodynamic is a statistical theory for large atomic system\nunder constraints of energy[1] and the economy can be considered a large system\ngoverned by complex rules. The present job proposes a new application, starting\nfrom econophysic, passing throughout the thermodynamic laws to interpret and to\ndescribed the Technology Transfer (TT) activities. Using the definition of\neconomy (i.e. economy[dictionary def.] = the process or system by which goods\nand services are produced, sold, and bought in a country or region) the TT can\nbe considered an important sub-domain of the economy and a transversal new area\nof the scientific research. The TT is the process of transferring knowledge,\nthat uses the results from the research to produce innovation and to ensure\nthat scientific and technological developments could become accessible to a\nwider range of users. Starting from important Universities (MIT, Stanford,\nOxford, etc) nowadays the TT is assuming a central role. It is called the third\nmission, together with education and research. The importance to provide new\ntheories and tools to describe the TT activities and their behavior, has been\nretained fundamental to support the social rapid evolution that is involving\nthe TT offices. The presented work uses the thermodynamic theories applying\nthem to Technology Transfer and starting from the concept of entropy, exergy\nand anergy. The output analysis should become an help to make decision to\nimprove the TT activities and a better resources employment.\n", "  We present the first experimental observations of phononic four-wave mixing\n(FWM) in a piezoelectrically actuated free-free beam microstructure. The FWM\nresponse is facilitated by the intrinsic coupling between a driven mode and an\nauto-parametrically excited sub-harmonic mode. Motivated by the experimental\nresults, a dynamical model for FWM has been specified.\n", "  The regular hyperbranched polymers (RHPs), also known as Vicsek fractals, are\nan important family of hyperbranched structures which have attracted a wide\nspread attention during the past several years. In this paper, we study the\nfirst-passage properties for random walks on the RHPs. Firstly, we propose a\nway to label all the different nodes of the RHPs and derive exact formulas to\ncalculate the mean first-passage time (MFPT) between any two nodes and the mean\ntrapping time (MTT) for any trap node. Then, we compare the trapping efficiency\nbetween any two nodes of the RHPs by using the MTT as the measures of trapping\nefficiency. We find that the central node of the RHPs is the best trapping site\nand the nodes which are the farthest nodes from the central node are the worst\ntrapping sites. Furthermore, we find that the maximum of the MTT is about $4$\ntimes more than the minimum of the MTT. The result is similar to the results in\nthe recursive fractal scale-free trees and T-fractal, but it is quite different\nfrom that in the recursive non-fractal scale-free trees. These results can help\nunderstanding the influences of the topological properties and trap location on\nthe trapping efficiency.\n", "  In high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) systems using non-ionizing\nmethods in cancer treatment, if the device is applied to the body externally,\nthe HIFU beam can damage nearby healthy tissues and burn skin due to lack of\nknowledge about the viscoelastic properties of patient tissue and failure to\nconsider the physical properties of tissue in treatment planning. Addressing\nthis problem by using various methods, such as MRI or ultrasound, elastography\ncan effectively measure visco-elastic properties of tissue and fits within the\npattern of stimulation and total treatment planning. In this paper, in a linear\npath of HIFU propagation, and by considering the smallest part of the path,\nincluding voxel with three mechanical elements of mass, spring and damper,\nwhich represents the properties of viscoelasticity of tissue, by creating waves\nof HIFU in the wire environment of MATLAB mechanics and stimulating these\nelements, pressure and heat transfer due to stimulation in the hypothetical\nvoxel was obtained. Through the repeatability of these three-dimensional\nelements, tissue is created. The measurement was performed on three layers. The\nvalues of these elements for liver tissue and kidney of sheep in a practical\nexample and outside the body are measured, and pressure and heat for three\nlayers of liver and kidney tissue of an organism were obtained by applying\nultrasound signals with a designed model. This action is repeated in three\ndifferent directions, and the results are then compared with simulation\nsoftware for ultrasound, as a reference to U.S. Food and Drug Administration\n(FDA) measures for HIFU, as well as comparisons of results with an operational\nmethod for an HIFU cell.\n", "  We review recent progress in our understanding of the physics of energetic\nparticles in our Galaxy, in active galaxies such as starburst galaxies, in\nactive galactic nuclei and in the jets and radio hot spots of powerful radio\ngalaxies and radioloud quasars. We propose that cosmic rays originate mainly in\nthree sites, a) normal supernova explosions into the approximately homogeneous\ninterstellar medium, b) supernova explosions into stellar winds, and c) hot\nspots of powerful radio galaxies. The predictions based on this proposition\nhave been tested successfully against airshower data over the particle energy\nrange from 10 TeV to 100 EeV. The low energy cosmic ray particles carried out\nby galactic winds to the intergalactic medium may ionize and heat this medium\nconsistent with all known constraints. Furthermore we propose that radioloud\nquasars accelerate nuclei to high energies in shocks in the inner sections of\ntheir jets, and thus initiate hadronic cascades which produce the $\\gamma$-ray\nemission observed with GRO. Radio observations of the Galactic center compact\nsource suggest that there is a jet similar to that in quasars, but very much\nweaker in its emission; simple modelling suggests that the power carried by\nthis jet is of order similar to the accretion disk luminosity. By analogy we\nspeculate that also radioweak quasars have jets which carry a large proportion\nof the accretion power, and which accelerate particles to high energy.\n", "  These lectures provide an introductory review of big bang cosmology. I\ndiscuss the expanding Friedmann-Robertson-Walker universe, summarizing the\nobservational evidence which has led to its adoption as the `standard'\ncosmological model and reviewing its basic properties. Subsequent lectures\nprovide an overview of the early universe. The final lectures give an\nintroduction to the inflationary universe, beginning with the motivating\npuzzles of the standard cosmology (the horizon and flatness problems) and\nending with the inflationary production of quantum field fluctuations and their\npossible role in seeding the large-scale structure of the Universe.\n", "  We describe the changes to the standard primordial black hole constraints on\ndensity perturbations if there are modifications to the standard cosmology\nbetween the time of formation and nucleosynthesis.\n", "  We propose a simple model in which the cosmological dark matter consists of\nparticles whose mass increases with the scale factor of the universe. The\nparticle mass is generated by the expectation value of a scalar field which\ndoes not have a stable vacuum state, but which is effectively stabilized by the\nrest energy of the ambient particles. As the universe expands, the density of\nparticles decreases, leading to an increase in the vacuum expectation value of\nthe scalar (and hence the mass of the particle). The energy density of the\ncoupled system of variable-mass particles (``vamps'') redshifts more slowly\nthan that of ordinary matter. Consequently, the age of the universe is larger\nthan in conventional scenarios.\n", "  A cosmological scenario of a light axino and a lighter gravitino is\npresented. The most important consequence is that it can mimick the mixed dark\nmatter (MDM) model of the large scale structure formation. The presence of\naxino and gravitino is inevitable in supergravity extension of the invisible\naxion solution of the strong CP problem. The possibility of a light gravitino\nis popular in the recent efforts of gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking.\n", "  An overview of some new results in open inflation over the past year,\nincluding the calculation of gravity wave contributions to the Cosmic Microwave\nBackground. Proceedings for COSMO-97, held in Ambleside, U.K., hence very short\ndue to space limitations (the version for the web is more than 3 pages because\narchive numbers have been added for the references).\n", "  We consider the evolution of cosmological perturbations at the QCD\ntransition, in particular the sudden reheating from a supercooled universe to\nthe transition temperature. Sudden reheating happens at a specific temperature,\nhence density, and singles out one specific hypersurface. Underdensities reach\nthe reheating earlier than overdensities, there is a short period of huge\npressure differences which leads to a jump in the fluid velocity. Density\nperturbations of scales far below the Hubble radius $\\lambda\\ll R_H $ get an\namplification which grows quadratically in wavenumber. Primordial black hole\nformation will not be sufficiently amplified by the QCD transition unless the\ninitial spectrum is fine tuned.\n", "  Recent research has severely constrained the standard ``defect'' models of\ncosmic structure formation. Here I discuss the nature of the problems with\ndefect models, and place this discussion in the context of the big picture of\ncosmic structure formation. In particular, I classify models of cosmic\nstructure formation as either ``causal'' or ``acausal'', and ask whether the\nproblems with the defect models extend to all other causal models. I argue that\ndetermining the causal nature of the primordial perturbations is within the\nreach of modern cosmology, and that such a determination would yield deep\ninsights into the very early Universe.\n", "  The current cosmological constraints on a dark matter axion are reviewed. We\ndescribe the basic mechanisms by which axions are created in the early\nuniverse, both in the standard thermal scenario in which axion strings form and\nin inflationary models. In the thermal scenario, the dominant process for axion\nproduction is through the radiative decay of an axion string network, which\nimplies a dark matter axion of mass m_a ~ 100 microeV with specified large\nuncertainties. An inflationary phase does not affect this string bound if the\nreheat temperature is high T_reh > f_a or, conversely, for T_reh < f_a, if the\nHubble parameter during inflation is large H_1 > f_a; in both cases, strings\nform and we return to the standard picture with a m_a ~ 100 microeV dark matter\naxion. Inflationary models with f_a > H_1 > T_reh face strong CMBR constraints\nand require `anthropic misalignment' fine-tuning in order to produce a dark\nmatter axion; in this case, some inflation models are essentially incompatible\nwith a detectable axion, while others can be engineered to allow a dark matter\naxion anywhere in a huge mass range below m_a < 1 meV. We endeavour to clarify\nthe sometimes confusing and contradictory literature on axion cosmology.\n", "  We present the status of our study into the feasibility of estimating the\nparameters of inflation from planned satellite observations of the anisotropy\nof the cosmic microwave background (CMB).We describe a perturbative procedure\nfor studying inflation models with soft departures from scale free spectra and\nfind that in this case the parameters of inflation are likely to be well\ndetermined. We also demonstrate that radical departures from scale free initial\nperturbations with broad features in $k$-space can be be measured by Planck.\nHowever, allowing for very fine features in $k$-space can very strongly\ncompromise the ability to measure cosmological parameters.\n", "  This review covers applications of quantum Monte Carlo methods to quantum\nmechanical problems in the study of electronic and atomic structure, as well as\napplications to statistical mechanical problems both of static and dynamic\nnature. The common thread in all these applications is optimization of\nmany-parameter trial states, which is done by minimization of the variance of\nthe local or, more generally for arbitrary eigenvalue problems, minimization of\nthe variance of the configurational eigenvalue.\n", "  We consider the static elastoplastic theory of dislocations in an\nelastoplastic material. We use a Yang-Mills type Lagrangian (the teleparallel\nequivalent of Hilbert-Einstein Lagrangian) and some Lagrangians with\nanisotropic constitutive laws. The translational part of the generalized affine\nconnection is utilized to describe the theory of elastoplasticity in the\nframework of a translation gauge theory. We obtain a system of Yang-Mills field\nequations which express the balance of force and moment.\n", "  A (microscopic) static elastoplastic field theory of dislocations with moment\nand force stresses is considered. The relationship between the moment stress\nand the Nye tensor is used for the dislocation Lagrangian. We discuss the\nstress field of an infinitely long screw dislocation in a cylinder, a dipole of\nscrew dislocations and a coaxial screw dislocation in a finite cylinder. The\nstress fields have no singularities in the dislocation core and they are\nmodified in the core due to the presence of localized moment stress.\nAdditionally, we calculated the elastoplastic energies for the screw\ndislocation in a cylinder and the coaxial screw dislocation. For the coaxial\nscrew dislocation we find a modified formula for the so-called Eshelby twist\nwhich depends on a specific intrinsic material length.\n", "  We present a study of non-equilibrium phenomena observed in the electrical\nconductance of insulating granular aluminium thin films. An anomalous field\neffect and its slow relaxation are studied in some detail. The phenomenology is\nvery similar to the one already observed in indium oxide. The origin of the\nphenomena is discussed. In granular systems, the present experiments can\nnaturally be interpreted along two different lines. One relies on a slow\npolarisation in the dielectric surrounding the metallic islands. The other one\nrelies on a purely electronic mechanism: the formation of an electron Coulomb\nglass in the granular metal. More selective experiments and/or quantitative\npredictions about the Coulomb glass properties are still needed to definitely\ndistinguish between the two scenarii.\n", "  The perfect-nesting instability towards antiferromagnetism of the Hubbard\nmodel is suppressed by next-nearest neighbor hopping t'. The exact asymptotic\nbehavior of the critical coupling U_c(t') at small t' is calculated in\ndimensions d=2,3 and infinity using Hartree theory, and the order of the\ntransition is determined. A region of stability of a metallic antiferromagnetic\nphase in d=3 is identified.\n", "  This work deals with the overdamped motion of a particle in a fluctuating\none-dimensional periodic potential. If the potential has no inversion symmetry\nand its fluctuations are asymmetric and correlated in time, a net flow can be\ngenerated at finite temperatures. We present results for the stationary current\nfor the case of a piecewise linear potential, especially for potentials being\nclose to the case with inversion symmetry. The aim is to study the stationary\ncurrent as a function of the potential. Depending on the form of the potential,\nthe current changes sign once or even twice as a function of the correlation\ntime of the potential fluctuations. To explain these current reversals, several\nmechanisms are proposed. Finally, we discuss to what extent the model is useful\nto understand the motion of biomolecular motors.\n", "  We study hierarchical network models which have recently been introduced to\napproximate the Chalker-Coddington model for the integer quantum Hall effect\n(A.G. Galstyan and M.E. Raikh, PRB 56 1422 (1997); Arovas et al., PRB 56, 4751\n(1997)). The hierarchical structure is due to a recursive method starting from\na finite elementary cell. The localization-delocalization transition occurring\nin these models is displayed in the flow of the conductance distribution under\nincreasing system size. We numerically determine this flow, calculate the\ncritical conductance distribution, the critical exponent of the localization\nlength, and the multifractal exponents of critical eigenstates.\n", "  The spin flip of the conduction electrons at the interface of a ferromagnetic\nand a nonmagnetic part of a metallic wire, suspended between two electrodes, is\nshown to tort the wire when a current is driven through it.\n  In order to enhance the effect it is suggested to use an alternating current\nin resonance with the torsional oscillations.\n  Thereby the magnetic polarization of the conduction electrons in the\nferromagnet can be measured directly, and compared to the total magnetization.\n  This may yield new information on the transport properties of the narrow band\nelectrons in itinerant ferromagnets.\n", "  We overview our recent studies of cosmological models with expansion and\nglobal rotation. Problems of the early rotating models are discussed, and the\nclass of new viable cosmologies is described in detail. Particular attention is\npaid to the observational effects of the cosmic rotation.\n", "  We clarify the way in which cosmological perturbations of quantum origin,\nproduced during inflation, assume classical properties. Two features play an\nimportant role in this process: First, the dynamics of fluctuations which are\npresently on large cosmological scales leads to a very peculiar state (highly\nsqueezed) that is indistinguishable, in a precise sense, from a classical\nstochastic process. This holds for almost all initial quantum states. Second,\nthe process of decoherence by interaction with the environment distinguishes\nthe field amplitude basis as a robust pointer basis. We discuss in detail the\ninterplay between these features and use simple analogies such as the free\nquantum particle to illustrate the main conceptual issues.\n", "  These lectures discuss field theoretic techniques that might allow for\nrealistic simulations of lattice QCD on small computers.\n", "  The possibility of exploring the systematics of the spectroscopy, strong\ndynamics, and the weak and rare decay modes of b--quark systems at hadron\ncolliders such as Fermilab, LHC and SSC, is discussed. A copious yield of\n$10^{10}$ detected $B$--mesons is readily accessible in a dedicated Fermilab\nprogram, and implies a vast array of accessible decay modes, including second\norder weak processes and $CP$--violation, which will be unavailable elsewhere\nuntil the commissioning of LHC or SSC. Kinematic and flavor tagging, utilizing\nthe ``daughter pions'' from resonances, is expected to play a major role in\nsemileptonic weak decay studies and the search for $CP$--violation. Plenary\ntalk, Workshop on $B$ Physics at Hadron Accelerators, Snowmass, Colorado, June\n25, 1993; Invited Lecture, TASI, Boulder, Colorado, June 18, 1993.\n", "  In these lectures we present the motivation for dynamical electroweak\nsymmetry breaking and its most popular realization, technicolor. We introduce\nthe basic ideas of technicolor and its companion theory of flavor, extended\ntechnicolor. We review the classical theory of technicolor, based on naive\nscaling from quantum chromodynamics, and discuss the classical theory's fatal\nflaws. Finally, we describe the principal attempt to correct these flaws, the\ntheory of walking technicolor.\n", "  I review the present state of our knowledge about the masses and weak mixing\nelements of the u, d, s quarks. This is the written version of lectures given\nin the 1993 Theoretical Advanced Study Institute (TASI).\n", "  In a series of three lectures, I review the theory and phenomenology of heavy\nquark masses and mixing angles and the status of their determination. In\naddition, I give an introduction to heavy quark symmetry, with the main\nemphasis on the development of heavy quark effective field theory and its\napplication to obtain a model-independent determination of $|V_{cb}|$.\n", "  Higgs boson production at the LHC within the Standard Model and its minimal\nsupersymmetric extension is reviewed. The predictions for decay rates and\nproduction cross sections are updated by choosing the present value of the top\nquark mass and recent parton density sets. Moreover, all relevant higher order\ncorrections, some of which have been obtained only recently, are included in a\nconsistent way.\n", "  I describe work done in collaboration with M. Joyce and K. Kainulainen on (1)\nthe strength of the electroweak phase transition in the MSSM and (2) the\nmechanism for producing the baryon asymmetry during the phase transition. In\nthe former we compare the effective potential and dimensional reduction methods\nfor describing the phase transition and search the parameter space of the MSSM\nfor those values where it is strong enough. In the latter we give a systematic\ncomputation of the baryon asymmetry due the CP-violating force acting on\ncharginos in the vicinity of the bubble wall. We find that a light right-handed\nstop, a light Higgs boson, and a large phase in the mu parameter, are the main\nnecessary ingredients for producing the baryon asymmetry.\n", "  I review recent work concerning the microphysics of cosmic string solutions\nof N=1 supersymmetric gauge field theories.\n", "  An inflationary stage dominated by a D-term avoids the slow-roll problem of\ninflation in supergravity and can naturally emerge in theories with a\nnon-anomalous or anomalous U(1) gauge symmetry. In this talk different aspects\nof D-term inflation are discussed.\n", "  The current status of neutrino oscillation searches with reactors and\naccelerators is reviewed. An outlook, especially on future long baseline\nneutrino oscillation projects, is given.\n", "  The axion decay into electron-positron pair $a \\to e^+ e^-$ is studied in an\nexternal magnetic field in KSVZ-model where axions have only induced coupling\nto leptons. The axion lifetime in the field decreases with energy and field\nstrength to seconds.\n", "  Supersymmetric Peccei-Quinn symmetry and string theory predict a complex\nscalar field comprising a dilaton and an axion. These fields are massless at\nhigh energies, but it is known since long that the axion is stabilized in an\ninstanton dominated vacuum. Instantons and axions together also provide a\nmechanism to stabilize a dilaton, thus accounting for a dilaton as a possible\ncold dark matter component accompanying the axion. We briefly review the\nprospects of this scenario and point out further implications.\n", "  A brief review of non-universalities in the soft SUSY breaking sector of\nsupergravity grand unification is given. The effects of these\nnon-universalities on the analysis of event rates in neutralino nucleus\nscattering are discussed. An analysis is also given of the implications of the\nsimultaneous imposition of proton stability and dark matter constraints. One\nfinds that these constraints put an upper limit on the gluino mass.\n", "  I review some of the mechanisms through which primordial magnetic fields may\nbe created in the electroweak phase transition. I show that no magnetic fields\nare produced initially from two-bubble collisions in a first-order transition.\nThe initial field produced in a three-bubble collision is computed. The\nevolution of fields at later times is discussed.\n", "  In a recent paper we proposed a new model of inflation based on the\nsoft-breaking of N=2 supersymmetric SU(2) Yang-Mills theory. The advantage of\nsuch a model is the fact that we can write an exact expression for the\neffective scalar potential, including perturbative and non-perturbative\neffects. We find that the scalar condensate that plays the role of the inflaton\ncan drive a long period of cosmological expansion in the weak coupling Higgs\nregion, and end inflation in the strong coupling monopole region, where\nreheating takes place. The model predicts the right amount of temperature\nanisotropies in the microwave background, a precise spectral tilt, $n=0.91$,\nand negligible gravitational wave perturbations.\n", "  We discuss the (non)-restoration of global and local symmetries at high\ntemperature. First, we analyze a two-scalar model with $Z_2 \\times Z_2$\nsymmetry using the exact renormalization group. We conclude that inverse\nsymmetry breaking is possible in this kind of models within the perturbative\nregime. Regarding local symmetries, we consider the $SU(2) \\otimes U(1)$ gauge\nsymmetry and focus on the case of a strongly interacting scalar sector.\nEmploying a model-independent chiral Lagrangian we find indications of symmetry\nrestoration.\n", "  A supersymmetric model based on a left-right symmetric gauge group is\nproposed where hybrid inflation, baryogenesis and neutrino oscillations are\nlinked.This scheme, supplemented by a familiar ansatz for the neutrino Dirac\nmasses and mixing of the two heaviest families and with the MSW resolution of\nthe solar neutrino puzzle, implies that $m_{\\nu_{\\tau}}$ lies between 1 and 9\neV. The mixing angle $\\theta_{\\mu \\tau}$ is predicted to lie in a narrow range\nwhich will be partially tested by the Chorus/Nomad experiment.\n", "  Future sattelite (MAP and Planck) balloon and ground based experiments will\nthe determine the basic cosmological parameters within a few percent. We\nexamine here the effect of this on constraining the SUSY parameter space for\nsupergravity R-parity conserving models (with tanbeta < 25) for the cases of\nnuCDM and LambdaCDM cosmological models. For the nuCDM (LambdaCDM) models, the\ngluino mass is restricted by m_g~ < 720(540)GeV. In both cases, the\ncosmological constraints are sensitive to non-universal SUSY soft breaking\nproducing a lower bound m_g~ > 400GeV in some regions and for the nuCDM model,\ngaps in the allowed m_g~ range for other regions. For gluino (neutralino)\nmasses greater than 450(65)GeV, m_0 is constrained to be small making the quark\nand slepton mass light generally light and detrmined mostly by m_g~.\n", "  In this talk we discuss a model of inflation based on a simple variant of the\nNMSSM, called $\\phi$NMSSM \\cite{phiNMSSM}, where the additional singlet $\\phi$\nplays the role of the inflaton in hybrid (or inverted hybrid) type models. As\nin the original NMSSM, the $\\phi$NMSSM solves the $\\mu$ problem of the MSSM via\nthe VEV of a gauge singlet $N$, but unlike the NMSSM does not suffer from\ndomain wall problems since the offending $Z_3$ symmetry is replaced by an\napproximate Peccei-Quinn symmetry which also solves the strong CP problem, and\nleads to an invisible axion with interesting cosmological consequences. The\nmodel predicts a spectral index $n=1$ to one part in $10^{12}$.\n", "  The phenomenology of a low-energy supersymmetry at hadron colliders is\ndiscussed with consideration of the minimal supergravity model, with a large\ntop quark Yukawa coupling at the grand unification mass scale, and gauge\nmediated symmetry breaking models. Possible supersymmetry interpretations of\nsome unexplained events are mentioned.\n", "  Inflation arises in supersymmetric grand unified theories (susy GUTs) without\nfine tuning and cosmic strings usually form at the end of inflation. Hence both\nstrings and inflation contribute to the density perturbations in the very early\nuniverse which lead to structure formation and to CMB anisotropies. This may\ngive us a hint as to the $B-L$ breaking scale.\n", "  I offer some computational details and useful and concise formulae to\ncalculate the effective potential for a general abelian supersymmetric model at\nhigh temperature and density. It will be shown that such cases are very good\ncandidates for symmetry nonrestoration at high temperature, providing large\ndensities are present.\n", "  Rochelle salt has a remarkable characteristic of becoming more ordered for a\nrange of high temperatures before melting. In the particle physics language\nthis means more symmetry breaking for high T. In many realistic field theories\nthis is a perfectly consistent scenario which has profound consequences in the\nearly universe. In particular it implies that there may be no domain wall and\nmonopole problems, and it may also play an important role in baryogenesis if CP\nand P are broken spontaneously. In the case of the monopole problem this may\nrequire a large background charge of the universe. The natural candidates for\nthis background charge are a possible lepton number in the neutrino sea or\nglobal continous R-charges in supersymmetric theories.\n", "  I report on recent numerical simulations of the simplest field theory with\ncosmic string solutions, the Abelian Higgs model. We find that random networks\nof string quickly converge to a scaling solution in which the network scale\nlength $\\xi$ increases linearly with time. There are very few loops with sizes\nless than $\\xi$, and the strings are smooth, showing no signs of ``small scale\nstructure''. We claim that particle production is the dominant energy-loss\nmechanism, not gravitational radiation as previously thought. For strings in\nGrand Unified Models, stringent constraints can be placed from cosmic ray\nobservations on the string tension $\\mu$: we estimate $G\\mu < 10^{-9}$, three\norders of magnitude lower than the constraint from Cosmic Microwave Background\nfluctuations.\n", "  We review work done over the last years on the macroscopic and microscopic\nentropy of supersymmetric black holes in fourdimensional N=2 supergravity and\nin N=2 compactifications of string theory and M-theory. Particular emphasis is\nput on the crucial role of higher curvature terms and of modifications of the\narea law in obtaining agreement between the macroscopic entropy, which is a\ngeometric property of black hole solutions and the microscopic entropy, which\nis computed by state counting in Calabi-Yau compactifications of string or\nM-theory. We also discuss invariance properties of the entropy under stringy\nT-duality and S-duality transformations in N=2,4 compactifications in presence\nof higher curvature terms.\n  In order to make the paper self-contained we review the laws of black hole\nmechanics in higher derivative gravity, the definition of entropy as a surface\ncharge, the superconformal off-shell description of N=2 supergravity, special\ngeometry, and N=2 compactifications of heterotic and type II string theory and\nof M-theory.\n", "  We analyze certain brane bound states in M-theory and their descendants in\ntype IIA string theory, all involving 3-form or 2-form background fluxes. Among\nthem are configurations which represent NCYM, NCOS and ODp-theories in the\nscaling limit of OM-theory. In particular, we show how the conditions for the\nembedding to preserve supersymmetry are modified by the presence of the flux\nand discuss their relations for the various different bound states. Via the\nformalism of geometric quantization such a deformation of a supersymmetric\ncycle is related to a non-commutativity of its coordinates. We also study\npossible non-commutative deformations of the Seiberg-Witten curve of N=2\nsupersymmetric gauge theories due to non-trivial H-flux.\n", "  We present master formulas for the divergent part of the one-loop effective\naction for a minimal operator of any order in the 4-dimensional curved space\nand for an arbitrary nonminimal operator in the flat space.\n", "  In these lectures we give a geometrical formulation of N-extended\nsupergravities which generalizes N=2 special geometry of N=2 theories. In all\nthese theories duality symmetries are related to the notion of \"flat symplectic\nbundles\" and central charges may be defined as \"sections\" over these bundles.\nAttractor points giving rise to \"fixed scalars\" of the horizon geometry and\nBekenstein-Hawking entropy formula for extremal black-holes are discussed in\nsome details.\n", "  The reduced O(3)-sigma model with an O(3)->O(2) symmetry breaking potential\nis considered with an additional Skyrmionic term, i.e. a totally antisymmetric\nquartic term in the field derivatives. This Skyrme term does not affect the\nclassical static equations of motionwhich, however, allow an unstable sphaleron\nsolution. Quantum fluctuations around the static classical solution are\nconsidered for the determination of the rate of thermally induced transitions\nbetween topologically distinct vacua mediated by the sphaleron. The main\ntechnical effect of the Skyrme term is to produce an extra measure factor in\none of the fluctuation path integrals which is therefore evaluated using a\nmeasure-modified Fourier-Matsubara decomposition (this being one of the few\ncases permitting this explicit calculation). The resulting transition rate is\nvalid in a temperature region different from that of the original Skyrme-less\nmodel, and the crossover from transitions dominated by thermal fluctuations to\nthose dominated by tunneling at the lower limit of this range depends on the\nstrength of the Skyrme coupling.\n", "  A string cosmology scenario (\"pre-big-bang\") postulates that the evolution of\nthe Universe starts from a state of very small curvature and coupling,\nundergoes a long phase of dilaton-driven kinetic inflation and at some later\ntime joins smoothly standard radiation dominated cosmological evolution, thus\ngiving rise to a singularity free inflationary cosmology. I report on recent\nprogress in understanding some outstanding issues such as initial conditions,\ngraceful exit transition and generation of inhomogeneity perturbations.\n", "  Although Lorentz symmetry has been tested at low energy with extremely good\naccuracy, its validity at very high energy is much less well established. If\nLorentz symmetry violation (LSV) is energy-dependent (e.g. $\\propto E^2$), it\ncan be of order 1 at Planck scale and undetectable at GeV scale or below.\nSimilarly, superluminal particles with positive mass and energy (superbradyons)\ncan exist and be the ultimate building blocks of matter. We discuss a few\ncosmological consequences of such a scenario, as well as possible experimental\ntests.\n", "  We investigate in detail the effects of a QND vibrational number measurement\nmade on single ions in a recently proposed measurement scheme for the\nvibrational state of a register of ions in a linear rf trap [C. D'Helon and\nG.J. Milburn, Phys. Rev. A 54, 5141 (1996)]. The performance of a measurement\nshows some interesting patterns which are closely related to searching.\n", "  It is shown that the time-energy uncertainty relation can be combined into\nthe position-momentum uncertainty relation covariantly in the quark model of\nhadrons. This leads to a Lorentz-invariant form of the uncertainty relations.\nThis model explains that the quark model and the parton model are two different\nmanifestations of the same covariant model. In particular, this covariant model\nexplains why the coherent amplitudes in the quark model become incoherent,\nafter a Lorentz boost, in the parton model. It is shown that this lack of\ncoherence is consistent with the present form of quantum mechanics.\n", "  We build, using group-theoretic methods, a general framework for approaching\nmulti-particle entanglement. As far as entanglement is concerned, two states of\nn spin-1/2 particles are equivalent if they are on the same orbit of the group\nof local rotations (U(2)^n). We give a method for finding the number of\nparameters needed to describe inequivalent n spin-1/2 particles states. We also\ndescribe how entanglement of states on a given orbit may be characterized by\nthe stability group of the action of the group of local rotations on any point\non the orbit.\n", "  Exact results are derived on the averaged dynamics of a class of random\nquantum-dynamical systems in continuous space. Each member of the class is\ncharacterized by a Hamiltonian which is the sum of two parts. While one part is\ndeterministic, time-independent and quadratic, the Weyl-Wigner symbol of the\nother part is a homogeneous Gaussian random field which is delta correlated in\ntime, but smoothly correlated in position and momentum. The averaged dynamics\nof the resulting white-noise system is shown to be a monotone mixing increasing\nquantum-dynamical semigroup. Its generator is computed explicitly. Typically,\nin the course of time the mean energy of such a system grows linearly to\ninfinity. In the second part of the paper an extended model is studied, which,\nin addition, accounts for dissipation by coupling the white-noise system\nlinearly to a quantum-mechanical harmonic heat bath. It is demonstrated that,\nunder suitable assumptions on the spectral density of the heat bath, the mean\nenergy then saturates for long times.\n", "  Philosophical analyses of causation take many forms but one major difficulty\nthey all aim to address is that of the spatio-temporal continuity between\ncauses and their effects. Bertrand Russell in 1913 brought the problem to its\nmost transparent form and made it a case against the notion of causation in\nphysics. In this essay, I focus on this subject of causal continuity and its\nrelated issues in classical and quantum physics.\n", "  We propose a setup capable of generating Fock states of a single mode\nradiation field. The scheme is based on coupling the signal field to a ring\ncavity through cross-Kerr phase modulation, and on conditional ON-OFF\nphotodetection at the output cavity mode. The same setup allows to prepare\nselected superpositions of Fock states and entangled two-mode states.\nRemarkably, the detector's quantum efficiency does not affect the reliability\nof the state synthesis.\n", "  We show the possibility of noiseless amplification of an optical image in\ncavities containing a parametric oscillator. We consider a confocal ring cavity\nwith plane mirrors and compare with the case of planar cavity. In the latter\ncase the system operates with severe spatial limitations, while in the confocal\ncase, there is the possibility of preserving the signal-to-noise ratio while\namplifying uniformely the entire image.\n"]}
