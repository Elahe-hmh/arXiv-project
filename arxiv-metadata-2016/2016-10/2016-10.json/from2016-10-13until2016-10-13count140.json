We then present a procedure to translate contextual scenarios into\ntemporal Leggett-Garg-type and spatial Bell-type ones. To demonstrate the\ngenerality of this approach we construct a family of spatial Bell-type\ninequalities. We show that in Leggett-Garg scenario a necessary condition for\ncontextuality in time is given by a violation of consistency conditions in\nConsistent Histories approach to quantum mechanics.\n", "  Transformation optics (TO) is a new tool for controlling electromagnetic\nfields. In the context of metamaterial technology, it provides a direct link\nbetween a desired electromagnetic (EM) phenomenon and the material response\nrequired for its occurrence. Recently, this powerful framework has been\nsuccessfully exploited to study surface plasmon assisted phenomena such as\nlight harvesting. Here, we review the general strategy based on TO to design\nplasmonic devices capable of harvesting light over a broadband spectrum and\nachieving considerable field confinement and enhancement. The methodology\nstarts with two-dimensional (2D) cases, such as 2D metal edges, crescent-shaped\ncylinders, nanowire dimers, and rough metal surfaces, and has been well\nextended to fully-fledged three-dimensional (3D) situations. The largely\nanalytic approach gives physical insights into the processes involved and\nsuggests the way forward to study a wide variety of plasmonic nanostructures.\n", "  We present a model of soft active particles that leads to a rich array of\ncollective behavior found also in dense biological swarms of bacteria and other\nunicellular organisms. Our model uses only local interactions, such as\nVicsek-type nearest neighbor alignment, short-range repulsion, and a local\nboundary term. Changing the relative strength of these interactions leads to\nmigrating swarms, rotating swarms and jammed swarms, as well as swarms that\nexhibit run-and-tumble motion, alternating between migration and either\nrotating or jammed states. Interestingly, although a migrating swarm moves\nslower than an individual particle, the diffusion constant can be up to three\norders of magnitude larger, suggesting that collective motion can be highly\nadvantageous, for example, when searching for food.\n", "  The paper is devoted to the study of shock formation of the 3-dimensional\nquasilinear wave equation \\begin{equation}\\label{Main Equation}\n  - \\big(1+3G^{\\prime\\prime}(0) (\\partial_t\\phi)^2\\big)\\partial^2_t \\phi\n+\\Delta\\phi=0,\\tag{\\textbf{$\\star$}} \\end{equation} where $G^{\\prime\\prime}(0)$\nis a non-zero constant. We will exhibit a family of smooth initial data and\nshow that the foliation of the incoming characteristic hypersurfaces collapses.\nSimilar to 1-dimensional conservational laws, we refer this specific type\nbreakdown of smooth solutions as shock formation. Since $(\\star)$ satisfies the\nclassical null condition, it admits global smooth solutions for small data.\nTherefore, we will work with large data (in energy norm). Moreover, no symmetry\ncondition is imposed on the initial datum. We emphasize the geometric\nperspectives of shock formations in the proof. More specifically, the key idea\nis to study the interplay between the following two objects: (1) the energy\nestimates of the linearized equations of $(\\star)$; (2) the differential\ngeometry of the Lorentzian metric $g=-\\dfrac{1}{\\left(1+3G^{\\prime\\prime}(0)\n(\\partial_t\\phi)^2\\right)} d t^2+dx_1^2+dx_2^2+dx_3^2$. Indeed, the study of\nthe characteristic hypersurfaces (implies shock formation) is the study of the\nnull hypersurfaces of $g$. The techniques in the proof are inspired by the work\n\\cite{Ch-Shocks} in which the formation of shocks for $3$-dimensional\nrelativistic compressible Euler equations with small initial data is\nestablished. We also use the short pulse method which is introduced in the\nstudy of formation of black holes in general relativity in \\cite{Ch-BlackHoles}\nand generalized in \\cite{K-R-09}.\n", "  We propose a scheme for translating metrological precision bounds into lower\nbounds on query complexity of quantum search algorithms. Within the scheme the\nlink between quadratic performance enhancement in idealized quantum\nmetrological and quantum computing schemes becomes clear. More importantly, we\nutilize results from the field of quantum metrology on a generic loss of\nquadratic quantum precision enhancement in presence of decoherence to infer an\nanalogous generic loss of quadratic speed-up in oracle based quantum computing.\nWhile most of our reasoning is rigorous, at one of the final steps, we need to\nmake use of an unproven technical conjecture. We hope that we will be able to\namend this deficiency in the near future, but we are convinced that even\nwithout the conjecture proven our results provide a novel and deep insight into\nrelationship between quantum algorithms and quantum metrology protocols.\n", "  The results of space-like separated measurements are independent of distant\nmeasurement settings, a property one might call two-way no-signalling. In\ncontrast, time-like separated measurements are only one-way no-signalling since\nthe past is independent of the future but not vice-versa. For this reason\ntemporal correlations that are formally identical to non-classical spatial\ncorrelations can still be modelled classically. We define non-classical\ntemporal correlations as the ones which cannot be simulated by propagating in\ntime a classical information content of a quantum system. We first show that\ntemporal correlations between results of any projective quantum measurements on\na qubit can be simulated classically. Then we present a sequence of POVM\nmeasurements on a single $m$-level quantum system that cannot be explained by\npropagating in time $m$-level classical system and using classical computers\nwith unlimited memory.\n", "  Entanglement can effectively increase communication channel capacity as\nevidenced by dense coding that predicts a capacity gain of 1 bit when compared\nto entanglement-free protocols. However, dense coding relies on Bell states and\nwhen implemented using photons the capacity gain is bounded by $0.585$ bits due\nto one's inability to discriminate between the four optically encoded Bell\nstates. In this paper we study the following question: Are there alternative\nentanglement-assisted protocols that rely only on linear optics, coincidence\nphoton counting and separable single photon input states and at the same time\nprovide a greater capacity gain than $0.585$ bits. We show that besides the\nBell states there is a class of bipartite four-mode two-photon entangled states\nthat facilitate an increase in channel capacity. We also discuss how the\nproposed scheme can be generalized to the case of two-photon $N$-mode entangled\nstates for $N=6,8$.\n", "  We explore the dynamical behaviour of cosmological models involving a scalar\nfield (with an exponential potential and a canonical kinetic term) and a matter\nfluid with spatial curvature included in the equations of motion. Using\nappropriately defined parameters to describe the evolution of the scalar field\nenergy in this situation, we find that there are two extra fixed points that\nare not present in the case without curvature. We also analyse the evolution of\nthe effective equation-of-state parameter for different initial values of the\ncurvature.\n", "  We derive a dispersion estimate for one-dimensional perturbed radial\nSchr\\\"odinger operators. We also derive several new estimates for solutions of\nthe underlying differential equation and investigate the behavior of the Jost\nfunction near the edge of the continuous spectrum.\n", "  Although neutrinos are probably the most abundant particles of the universe\ntheir mass is not yet known. Oscillation experiments have proven that at least\none of the neutrino mass states has m_{i}>0.05 eV while various interpretations\nof cosmological observations yielded an upper limit for the sum of neutrino\nmasses \\sum m_{i}<(0.14-1.7) eV. The searches for the yet unobserved\n0\\nu\\beta\\beta decay result in an effective neutrino mass\nm_{\\beta\\beta}<(0.2-0.7) eV. The analyses of measured tritium \\beta-spectra\nprovide an upper limit for the effective electron neutrino mass m(\\nu_e)<2 eV.\nIn this review, we summarize the experience of two generations of \\beta-ray\nspectroscopists who improved the upper limit of m(\\nu_e) by three orders of\nmagnitude. We describe important steps in the development of radioactive\nsources and electron spectrometers, and recapitulate the lessons from\nnow-disproved claims for the neutrino mass of 30 eV and the 17 keV neutrino\nwith an admixture larger than 0.03 %. We also pay attention to new experimental\napproaches and searches for hypothetical sterile neutrinos.\n", "  We study the Kondo Lattice Model (KLM) on a square lattice through a\nHartree-Fock approximation in which the local spins are treated\nsemi-classically, in the sense that their average values are modulated by a\nmagnetic wavevector $\\mathbf{Q}$ while they couple with the conduction\nelectrons through fermion operators. In this way, we obtain a ground state\nphase diagram in which spiral magnetic phases (in which the wavevector depends\non the coupling constants and on the density) interpolate between the\nlow-density ferromagnetic phase and the antiferromagnetic phase at half\nfilling; within small regions of the phase diagram commensurate magnetic phases\ncan coexist with Kondo screening. We have also obtained `Doniach-like'\ndiagrams, showing the effect of temperature on the ground state phases, and\nestablished that for some ranges of the model parameters (the exchange coupling\nand conduction electron density) the magnetic wavevector changes with\ntemperature, either continuously or abruptly (e.g., from spiral to\nferromagnetic).\n", "  Loop quantum cosmology(LQC) is the symmetric model of loop quantum gravity.\nIn this paper, we generalize the structure of loop quantum cosmology to the\ntheories with arbitrary spacetime dimensions. The isotropic and homogenous\ncosmological model in n+1 dimensions is quantized by the loop quantization\nmethod. Interestingly, we find that the underlying quantum theories are divided\ninto two qualitatively different sectors according to spacetime dimensions. The\neffective Hamiltonian and modified dynamical equations of n+1 dimensional LQC\nare obtained. Moreover, our results indicate that the classical big bang\nsingularity is resolved in arbitrary spacetime dimensions by a quantum bounce.\nWe also briefly discuss the similarities and differences between the n+1\ndimensional model and the 3+1 dimensional one. Our model serves as a first\nexample of higher dimensional loop quantum cosmology and offers possibility to\ninvestigate quantum gravity effects in higher dimensional cosmology.\n", "  One parameter quantization ambiguity is existed in Loop quantum gravity which\nis called the Immirzi parameter. In this paper, we fix this free paremater by\nconsidering the quasinormal mode spectrum of black holes in four and higher\nspacetime dimensions. As a consequence, our result consistents with\nBekenstein-Hawking entropy of a black hole. Moreover, we also give a possible\nquantum gravity explanation of the universal $\\ln(3)$ behavior of the\nquasinormal mode spectrum.\n", "  It is generally recognized that a distinguishing feature of life is its\npeculiar capability to avoid equilibration. The origin of this capability and\nits evolution along the timeline of abiogenesis is not yet understood. We\npropose to study an analog of this phenomenon that could emerge in\nnon-biological systems. To this end, we introduce the concept of sustainability\nof transient kinetic regimes. This concept is illustrated via investigation of\ncooperative effects in an extended system of compartmentalized chemical\noscillators under batch and semi-batch conditions. The computational study of a\nmodel system shows robust enhancement of lifetimes of the decaying oscillations\nwhich translates into the evolution of the survival function of the transient\nnon-equilibrium regime. This model does not rely on any form of replication.\nRather, it explores the role of a structured effective environment as a\ncontributor to the system-bath interactions that define non-equilibrium\nregimes. We implicate the noise produced by the effective environment of a\ncompartmentalized oscillator as the cause of the lifetime extension.\n", "  This paper collects and extends the lectures I gave at the \"XXIV\nInternational Fall Workshop on Geometry and Physics\" held in Zaragoza (Spain)\nAugust 31 - September 4, 2015. Within these lectures I review the formulation\nof Quantum Mechanics, and quantum theories in general, from a mathematically\nadvanced viewpoint, essentially based on the orthomodular lattice of elementary\npropositions, discussing some fundamental ideas, mathematical tools and\ntheorems also related to the representation of physical symmetries. The final\nstep consists of an elementary introduction the so-called (C*-) algebraic\nformulation of quantum theories.\n", "  Using molecular dynamics simulations, we show that an asymmetrically shaped\nnanoparticle in dilute solution possesses a spontaneously curved trajectory\nwithin finite time interval, instead of the generally expected random walk.\nThis unexpected dynamic behavior has a similarity to that of active matters,\nsuch as swimming bacteria, cells or even fishes, but is of a different physical\norigin. The key to the curved trajectory lies in the non-zero resultant force\noriginated from the imbalance of the collision forces acted by surrounding\nsolvent molecules on the shaped nanoparticle during its orientation regulation.\nTheoretical formulae based on the microscopic observation have been derived to\ndescribe this non-zero force and the resulted motion of the nanoparticle.\n", "  We report thermodynamic and transport properties, and also theoretical\ncalculations, for Cu-based compound Ca2Cu6P5 and compare with CaCu(2-x)P2. Both\nmaterials have layers of edge-sharing copper pnictide tetrahedral CuP4, similar\nto Fe-As and Fe-Se layers (with FeAs4, FeSe4) in the iron-based\nsuperconductors. Despite the presence of this similar transition-metal pnictide\nlayer, we find that both Ca2Cu6P5 and CaCu(2-x)P2 have temperature-independent\nmagnetic susceptibility and show metallic behavior with no evidence of either\nmagnetic ordering or superconductivity down to 1.8 K. CaCu(2-x)P2 is slightly\noff-stoichiometric, with delta = 0.14. Theoretical calculations suggest that\nunlike Fe 3d-based magnetic materials with a large density of states (DOS) at\nthe Fermi surface, Cu have comparatively low DOS, with the majority of the 3d\nspectral weight located well below Fermi level. The room-temperature\nresistivity value of Ca2Cu6P5 is only 9 micro ohm-cm, due to a substantial\nplasma frequency and an inferred electron-phonon coupling lambda of 0.073\n(significantly smaller than that of metallic Cu). Also, microscopy result shows\nthat Cu-Cu distance along the c-axis within the double layers can be very short\n(2.5 A), even shorter than metallic elemental copper bond (2.56 A). The value\nof dp over dT for CaCu(2-x)P2 at 300 K is approximately three times larger than\nin Ca2Cu6P5, which suggests the likelihood of stronger electron-phonon\ncoupling. This study shows that the details of Cu-P layers and bonding are\nimportant for their transport characteristics. In addition, it emphasizes the\nremarkable character of the DOS of '122' iron-based materials, despite much\nstructural similarities.\n", "  TaAs as one of the experimentally discovered topological Weyl semimetal has\nattracted intense interests recently. The ambient TaAs has two types of Weyl\nnodes which are not on the same energy level. As an effective way to tune\nlattice parameters and electronic interactions, high pressure is becoming a\nsignificant tool to explore new materials as well as their exotic states.\nTherefore, it is highly interesting to investigate the behaviors of topological\nWeyl fermions and possible structural phase transitions in TaAs under pressure.\nHere, with a combination of ab initio calculations and crystal structure\nprediction techniques, a new hexagonal P-6m2 phase is predicted in TaAs at\npressure around 14 GPa. Surprisingly, this new phase is a topological semimetal\nwith only single set of Weyl nodes exactly on the same energy level. The phase\ntransition pressure from the experimental measurements, including electrical\ntransport measurements and Raman spectroscopy, agrees with our theoretical\nprediction reasonably. Moreover, the P-6m2 phase seems to be quenched\nrecoverable to ambient pressure, which increases the possibilities of further\nstudy on the exotic behaviors of single set of Weyl fermions, such as the\ninterplay between surface states and other properties.\n", "  We show that the honeycomb Heisenberg antiferromagnet with $J_1/2=J_2=J_3$,\nwhere $J_{1/2/3}$ are first-, second- and third-neighbour couplings\nrespectively, forms a classical spin liquid with pinch-point singularities in\nthe structure factor at the Brillouin zone corners. Upon dilution with\nnon-magnetic ions, fractionalised degrees of freedom carrying $1/3$ of the free\nmoment emerge. Their effective description in the limit of low-temperature is\nthat of spins randomly located on a triangular lattice, with a frustrated\ninteraction of long-ranged logarithmic form. The XY version of this magnet\nexhibits nematic thermal order by disorder, which comes with a clear\nexperimental diagnostic.\n", "  The interaction of intruding objects with deformable materials is a common\nphenomenon, arising in impact and penetration problems, animal and vehicle\nlocomotion, and various geo-space applications. The dynamics of arbitrary\nintruders can be simplified using Resistive Force Theory (RFT), an empirical\nframework originally used for fluids but works surprisingly well, better in\nfact, in granular materials. That such a simple model describes behavior in dry\ngrains, a complex nonlinear material, has invigorated a search to determine the\nunderlying mechanism of RFT. We have discovered that a straightforward\nfriction-based continuum model generates RFT, establishing a link between RFT\nand local material behavior. Our theory reproduces experimental RFT data\nwithout any parameter fitting and generates RFT's key simplifying assumption: a\ngeometry-independent local force formula. Analysis of the system explains why\nRFT works better in grains than in viscous fluids, and leads to an analytical\ncriterion to predict RFT's in other materials.\n", "  We consider the triple Higgs coupling for $h(125)$ Higgs boson within the\nmost general 2HDM. At moderate values of parameters of model, allowing by\nmodern data, noticeable deviation of this coupling from its SM value is\nimprobable. This deviation can be sizable only if some measurable parameters of\nthe model are exotic.\n", "  The classical models for irreversible diffusion-influenced reactions can be\nderived by introducing absorbing boundary conditions to over-damped continuous\nBrownian motion (BM) theory. As there is a clear corresponding stochastic\nprocess, the mathematical description takes both Kolmogorov forward equation\nfor the evolution of the probability distribution function and the stochastic\nsample trajectories. This dual description is a fundamental characteristic of\nstochastic processes and allows simple particle based simulations to accurately\nmatch the expected statistical behavior. However, in the traditional theory\nusing the back-reaction boundary condition to model reversible reactions with\ngeminate recombinations, several subtleties arise: it is unclear what the\nunderlying stochastic process is, which causes complications in producing\naccurate simulations; and it is non-trivial how to perform an appropriate\ndiscretization for numerical computations. In this work, we derive a discrete\nstochastic model that recovers the classical models and their boundary\nconditions in the continuous limit. In the case of reversible reactions, we\nrecover the back-reaction boundary condition, unifying the back-reaction\napproach with those of current simulation packages. Furthermore, all the\ncomplications encountered in the continuous models become trivial in the\ndiscrete model. Our formulation brings to attention the question: With\ncomputations in mind, can we develop a discrete reaction kinetics model that is\nmore fundamental than its continuous counterpart?\n", "  We present a direct measurement of the mean halo occupation distribution\n(HOD) of galaxies taken from the eleventh data release (DR11) of the Sloan\nDigital Sky Survey-III Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS). The HOD\nof BOSS low-redshift (LOWZ: $0.2 < z < 0.4$) and Constant-Mass (CMASS: $0.43 <z\n<0.7$) galaxies is inferred via their association with the dark-matter halos of\n174 X-ray-selected galaxy clusters drawn from the XMM Cluster Survey (XCS).\nHalo masses are determined for each galaxy cluster based on X-ray temperature\nmeasurements, and range between ${\\rm log_{10}} (M_{180}/M_{\\odot}) = 13-15$.\nOur directly measured HODs are consistent with the HOD-model fits inferred via\nthe galaxy-clustering analyses of Parejko et al. for the BOSS LOWZ sample and\nWhite et al. for the BOSS CMASS sample. Under the simplifying assumption that\nthe other parameters that describe the HOD hold the values measured by these\nauthors, we have determined a best-fit alpha-index of 0.91$\\pm$0.08 and\n$1.27^{+0.03}_{-0.04}$ for the CMASS and LOWZ HOD, respectively. These\nalpha-index values are consistent with those measured by White et al. and\nParejko et al. In summary, our study provides independent support for the HOD\nmodels assumed during the development of the BOSS mock-galaxy catalogues that\nhave subsequently been used to derive BOSS cosmological constraints.\n", "  Quantum networks must classically exchange complex metadata between devices\nin order to carry out information for protocols such as teleportation,\nsuper-dense coding, and quantum key distribution. Demonstrating the integration\nof these new communication methods with existing network protocols, channels,\nand data forwarding mechanisms remains an open challenge. Software-defined\nnetworking (SDN) offers robust and flexible strategies for managing diverse\nnetwork devices and uses. We adapt the principles of SDN to the deployment of\nquantum networks, which are composed from unique devices that operate according\nto the laws of quantum mechanics. We show how quantum metadata can be managed\nwithin a software-defined network using the OpenFlow protocol, and we describe\nhow OpenFlow management of classical optical channels is compatible with\nemerging quantum communication protocols. We next give an example specification\nof the metadata needed to manage and control QPHY behavior and we extend the\nOpenFlow interface to accommodate this quantum metadata. We conclude by\ndiscussing near-term experimental efforts that can realize SDN's principles for\nquantum communication.\n", "  The newly observed $X, Y, Z$ exotic states are definitely not in the standard\n$Q\\bar Q'$ structures, thus their existence composes a challenge to our\nunderstanding on the fundamental principles of hadron physics. Therefore the\nstudies on their decay patterns which are determined by the non-perturbative\nQCD will definitely shed light on the concerned physics. Generally the\nfour-quark states might be in a molecular state or tetraquark or their mixture.\nIn this work, we adopt the suggestion that $Y(4630)$ is a charmonium-like\ntetraquark made of a diquark and an anti-diquark. If it is true, its favorable\ndecay mode should be $Y(4630)$ decaying into an open-charm baryon pair, since\nsuch a transition occurs via strong interaction and is super-OZI-allowed. In\nthis work, we calculate the decay width of $Y(4630)\\to\\Lambda_c\\bar{\\Lambda}_c$\nin the framework of the quark pair creation (QPC) model. Our numerical results\non the partial width computed in the tetraquark configuration coincide with the\nBelle data within a certain error tolerance.\n", "  It has recently been shown, in flat Robertson-Walker geometries, that the\ndynamics of gravitational actions which are minimally coupled to matter fields\nleads to the appearance of \"attractors\" - sets of physical observables on which\nphase space measures become peaked. These attractors will be examined in the\ncontext of inhomogeneous perturbations about the FRW background and in the\ncontext of anisotropic Bianchi I systems. We show that maximally expanding\nsolutions are generically attractors, i.e. any measure based on phase-space\nobservables becomes sharply peaked about those solutions which have $P=-\\rho$.\n", "  We investigate Fabry-Perot interference in an ultraclean carbon nanotube\nresonator. The conductance shows a clear superstructure superimposed onto\nconventional Fabry-Perot oscillations. A sliding average over the fast\noscillations reveals a characteristic slow modulation of the conductance as a\nfunction of the gate voltage. We identify the origin of this secondary\ninterference in intervalley and intravalley backscattering processes which\ninvolve wave vectors of different magnitude, reflecting the trigonal warping of\nthe Dirac cones. As a consequence, the analysis of the secondary interference\npattern allows us to estimate the chiral angle of the carbon nanotube.\n", "  Current studies of WN Toda field theory focus on correlation functions such\nthat the WN highest-weight representations in the fusion channels are\nmultiplicity-free. In this work, we study W3 Toda 4-point functions with\nmultiplicity in the fusion channel. The conformal blocks of these 4-point\nfunctions involve matrix elements of a fully-degenerate primary field with a\nhighest-weight in the adjoint representation of sl3, and a semi-degenerate\nprimary field with a highest-weight in the fundamental representation of sl3.\nWe show that, when the fusion rules are obeyed, the matrix elements of the\nfully-degenerate adjoint field, between two arbitrary descendant states, can be\ncomputed explicitly, on equal footing with the matrix elements of the\nsemi-degenerate fundamental field. Using null-state conditions, we obtain a\nfourth-order Fuchsian differential equation for the conformal blocks. Using\nOkubo theory, we show that, due to the presence of multiplicities, this\ndifferential equation belongs to a class of Fuchsian equations that is\ndifferent from those that have appeared so far in WN theories. We solve this\nequation, compute its monodromy group, and construct the monodromy-invariant\ncorrelation functions.\n", "  We consider a three-dimensional (3D) lattice model associated with the\nintertwiner of the quantized coordinate ring $A_q(sl_3)$, and introduce a\nfamily of layer to layer transfer matrices on $m\\times n$ square lattice. By\nusing the tetrahedron equation we derive their commutativity and bilinear\nrelations mixing various boundary conditions. At $q=0$ and $m=n$, they lead to\na new proof of the steady state probability of the $n$-species totally\nasymmetric zero range process obtained recently by the authors, revealing the\n3D integrability in the matrix product construction.\n", "  Mass spectra of excited states of the singly charmed baryons are calculated\nusing the hypercentral description of three body system. The baryon consist of\na charm quark and light quarks (u, d and s) are studied in the framework of QCD\nmotivated constituent quark model. The form of confinement potential is hyper\ncoloumb plus power potential with potential index $\\nu$, varying from 0.5 to\n2.0. The first order correction to the confinement potential is also\nincorporated in this approach. The radial as well as orbital excited state\nmasses of $\\Sigma_{c}^{++}, \\Sigma_{c}^+, \\Sigma_{c}^0, \\Xi_c^+, \\Xi_c^0,\n\\Lambda_c^+, \\Omega_c^0$ baryons, are reported in this paper. We have\nincorporated spin-spin, spin-orbit and tensor interactions perturbatively in\nthe present study. The semi-electronic decay of $\\Omega_c$ and $\\Xi_c$ are also\ncalculated using the spectroscopic parameters of these baryons. The computed\nresults are compared with other theoretical predictions as well as with the\navailable experimental observations. We also construct the Regge trajectory in\n($n_r$, $M^{2}$) and (J, $M^{2}$) plane for these baryons.\n", "  We propose that the vacuum state of a scalar field around a black hole is a\nmodified Unruh vacuum. In (1+1) dimensions, we show that a free-faller close to\nsuch an horizon can be modelled as an inertial observer in a modified Minkowski\nvacuum. The modification allows for information-leaking correlations at high\nfrequencies. Using a Gaussian detector centred at $k_0$, we find that the\nexpectation value of the number operator for a detector crossing the horizon is\nproportional to $1/|k_0|$, implying that the free-faller will observe unbounded\nnumbers of high energy photons, i.e. a firewall.\n", "  Cadmium zinc telluride (CdZnTe, CZT) radiation detectors are suitable for a\nvariety of applications, due to their high spatial resolution and spectroscopic\nenergy performance at room temperature. However, state-of-the-art detector\nsystems require high-performance readout electronics. Though an\napplication-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) is an adequate solution for the\nreadout, requirements of high dynamic range and high throughput are not\navailable in any commercial circuit. Consequently, the present study develops\nthe analog front-end electronics with operational amplifiers for an 8x8\npixelated CZT detector. For this purpose, we modeled an electrical equivalent\ncircuit of the CZT detector with the associated charge-sensitive amplifier\n(CSA). Based on a detailed network analysis, the circuit design is completed by\nnumerical values for various features such as ballistic deficit,\ncharge-to-voltage gain, rise time, and noise level. A verification of the\nperformance is carried out by synthetic detector signals and a pixel detector.\nThe experimental results with the pixel detector assembly and a 22Na\nradioactive source emphasize the depth dependence of the measured energy. After\npulse processing with depth correction based on the fit of the weighting\npotential, the energy resolution is 2.2% (FWHM) for the 511 keV photopeak.\n", "  It is well-known that when the magnetic field is stronger than a critical\nvalue, the spin imbalance can break the Cooper pairs of electrons and hence\nhinder the superconductivity in a spin-singlet channel. In a bilayer system of\nultra-cold Fermi gases, however, we demonstrate that the critical value of the\nmagnetic field at zero temperature can be significantly increased by including\na spin-flip tunnelling, which opens a gap in the spin-triplet channel near the\nFermi surface and hence reduces the influence of the effective magnetic field\non the superfluidity. The phase transition also changes from first order to\nsecond order when the tunnelling exceeds a critical value. Considering a\nrealistic experiment, this mechanism can be implemented by applying an\nintralayer Raman coupling between the spin states with a phase difference\nbetween the two layers.\n", "  In this paper we provide formulae that can be used to determine the\nuncertainty contributed to a measurement by a $K$-correction and, thus,\nvaluable information about which flux measurement will provide the most\naccurate $K$-corrected luminosity. All of this is done at the level of a\nGaussian approximation of the statistics involved, that is, where the galaxies\nin question can be characterized by a mean spectral energy distribution (SED)\nand a covariance function (spectral 2-point function). This paper also includes\napproximations of the SED mean and covariance for galaxies, and the three\ncommon subclasses thereof, based on applying the templates from Assef et al.\n(2010) to the objects in zCOSMOS bright 10k (Lilly et al. 2009) and photometry\nof the same field from Capak et al. (2007), Sanders et al. (2007), and the\nAllWISE source catalog.\n", "  Turbulent dynamo field amplification has often been invoked to explain the\nstrong field strengths in thin rims in supernova shocks ($\\sim 100 \\, \\mu$G)\nand in radio relics in galaxy clusters ($\\sim \\mu$G). We present high\nresolution MHD simulations of the interaction between pre-shock turbulence,\nclumping and shocks, to quantify the conditions under which turbulent dynamo\namplification can be significant. We demonstrate numerically converged field\namplification which scales with Alfv\\'en Mach number, $B/B_0 \\propto {\\mathcal\nM}_{\\rm A}$, up to ${\\mathcal M}_{\\rm A} \\sim 150$. This implies that the\npost-shock field strength is relatively independent of the seed field.\nAmplification is dominated by compression at low ${\\mathcal M}_{\\rm A}$, and\nstretching (turbulent amplification) at high ${\\mathcal M}_{\\rm A}$. For high\n$\\mathcal{M}_{\\rm A}$, the $B$-field grows exponentially and saturates at\nequipartition with turbulence, while the vorticity jumps sharply at the shock\nand subsequently decays; the resulting field is orientated predominately along\nthe shock normal (an effect only apparent in 3D and not 2D). This agrees with\nthe radial field bias seen in supernova remnants. By contrast, for low\n$\\mathcal{M}_{\\rm A}$, field amplification is mostly compressional, relatively\nmodest, and results in a predominantly perpendicular field. The latter is\nconsistent with the polarization seen in radio relics. Our results are\nrelatively robust to the assumed level of gas clumping. Our results imply that\nthe turbulent dynamo may be important for supernovae, but is only consistent\nwith the field strength, and not geometry, for cluster radio relics. For the\nlatter, this implies strong pre-existing $B$-fields in the ambient cluster\noutskirts.\n", "  We explore the possibility of engineering quantum states of a charged\nmechanical oscillator by coupling it to a stream of atoms in superpositions of\nhigh-lying Rydberg states. Our scheme relies on the driving of a two-phonon\nresonance within the oscillator by coupling it to an atomic two-photon\ntransition. This approach effectuates a controllable open system dynamics on\nthe oscillator that permits the dissipative creation of squeezed and other\nnon-classical states which are central to applications such as sensing and\nmetrology or for studies of fundamental questions concerning the boundary\nbetween classical and quantum mechanical descriptions of macroscopic objects.\nWe show that these features are robust to thermal noise arising from a coupling\nof the oscillator with the environment. Finally, we assess the feasibility of\nthe scheme finding that the required coupling strengths are challenging to\nachieve with current state-of-the-art technology.\n", "  The Rashba effect as an electrically tunable spin-orbit interaction is the\nbase for a multitude of possible applications such as spin filters, spin\ntransistors, and quantum computing using Majorana states in nanowires.\nMoreover, this interaction can determine the spin dephasing and\nantilocalization phenomena in two dimensions. However, the real space pattern\nof the Rashba parameter has never been probed, albeit it critically influences,\ne.g., the more robust spin transistors using the spin helix state and the\notherwise forbidden electron backscattering in topologically protected\nchannels. Here, we map this pattern down to nanometer length scales by\nmeasuring the spin splitting of the lowest Landau level using scanning\ntunnelling spectroscopy. We reveal strong fluctuations correlated with the\nlocal electrostatic potential for an InSb inversion layer with a large Rashba\ncoefficient (~1 eV{\\AA}). The novel type of Rashba field mapping enables a more\ncomprehensive understanding of the critical fluctuations, which might be\ndecisive towards robust semiconductor-based spintronic devices.\n", "  The Buda-Lund hydro model describes an expanding ellipsoidal fireball, and\nfits the observed elliptic flow and oscillating HBT radii successfully. Due to\nfluctuations in energy depositions, the fireball shape however fluctuates on an\nevent-by-event basis. The transverse plane asymmetry can be translated into a\nseries of multipole anisotropy coefficients. These anisotropies then result in\nmeasurable momentum-space anisotropies, to be measured with respect to their\nrespective symmetry planes. In this paper we detail an extension of the\nBuda-Lund model to multipole anisotropies and investigate the resulting flow\ncoefficients and oscillations of HBT radii.\n", "  We investigate a bounce inflation model with a graceful exit into the\nFriedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) decelerated Universe within $f(T)$ gravity\nframework, where $T$ is the torsion scalar in the teleparallelism. We study the\ncosmic thermal evolution, the model predicts a supercold Universe during the\nprecontraction phase, which is consistent with the requirements of the\nslow-roll models, while it performs a reheating period by the end of the\ncontraction with a maximum temperature just below the grand unified theory\n(GUT) temperature. However, it matches the radiation temperature of the hot big\nbang at later stages. The equation-of-state due to the effective gravitational\nsector suggests that our Universe is self-accelerated by teleparallel gravity.\nWe assume the matter component to be a canonical scalar field. We obtain the\nscalar field potential that is induced by the $f(T)$ theory. The power spectrum\nof the model is nearly scale invariant. In addition, we show that the model\nunifies inflaton and quintessence fields in a single model. Also, we revisited\nthe primordial fluctuations in $f(T)$ bounce cosmology, to study the\nfluctuations that are produced at the precontraction phase.\n", "  We present a method for the numerical calculation of derivatives of functions\nof general complex matrices. The method can be used in combination with any\nalgorithm that evaluates or approximates the desired matrix function, in\nparticular with implicit Krylov-Ritz-type approximations. An important use case\nfor the method is the evaluation of the overlap Dirac operator in lattice\nQuantum Chromodynamics (QCD) at finite chemical potential, which requires the\napplication of the sign function of a non-Hermitian matrix to some source\nvector. While the sign function of non-Hermitian matrices in practice cannot be\nefficiently approximated with source-independent polynomials or rational\nfunctions, sufficiently good approximating polynomials can still be constructed\nfor each particular source vector. Our method allows for an efficient\ncalculation of the derivatives of such implicit approximations with respect to\nthe gauge field or other external parameters, which is necessary for the\ncalculation of conserved lattice currents or the fermionic force in Hybrid\nMonte-Carlo or Langevin simulations. We also give an explicit deflation\nprescription for the case when one knows several eigenvalues and eigenvectors\nof the matrix being the argument of the differentiated function. We test the\nmethod for the two-sided Lanczos approximation of the finite-density overlap\nDirac operator on realistic $SU(3)$ gauge field configurations on lattices with\nsizes as large as $14\\times14^3$ and $6\\times18^3$.\n", "  In this paper we apply the strong deflection limit approach to investigate\nthe gravitational lensing phenomena beyond general relativity. This is\naccomplished by considering the lensing effects related to black hole solutions\nthat emerge out of the domain of Einstein gravity, namely, the ones acquired\nfrom the method of geometric deformation and the Casadio-Fabbri-Mazzacurati\nbrane-world black holes. The lensing observables, for those brane-world black\nhole metrics, are compared with the standard ones for the Schwarzschild case.\nWe prove that brane-world black holes could have significantly different\nobservational signatures, compared to the Schwarzschild black hole, with terms\ncontaining the post-Newtonian parameter, for the case of the\nCasadio-Fabbri-Mazzacurati, and terms with variable brane-world tension, for\nthe method of geometric deformation.\n", "  The Future Circular Collider (FCC) Study is aimed at assessing the physics\npotential and the technical feasibility of a new collider with centre-of-mass\nenergies, in the hadron-hadron collision mode, seven times larger than the\nnominal LHC energies. Operating such machine with heavy ions is an option that\nis being considered in the accelerator design studies. It would provide, for\nexample, Pb-Pb and p-Pb collisions at sqrt{s_NN} = 39 and 63 TeV, respectively,\nper nucleon-nucleon collision, with integrated luminosities above 30 nb^-1 per\nmonth for Pb-Pb. This is a report by the working group on heavy-ion physics of\nthe FCC Study. First ideas on the physics opportunities with heavy ions at the\nFCC are presented, covering the physics of the Quark-Gluon Plasma, of gluon\nsaturation, of photon-induced collisions, as well as connections with other\nfields of high-energy physics.\n", "  A measurement of the cross section for the inclusive production of isolated\nprompt photons in proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of\n$\\sqrt{s} = 8$ TeV is presented. The measurement covers the pseudo rapidity\nranges $|\\eta^{\\gamma}| < 1.37$ and $1.56 \\leq |\\eta^{\\gamma}| < 2.37$ in the\ntransverse energy range $25 < E_{\\rm T}^{\\gamma} < 1500$ GeV. The results are\nbased on an integrated luminosity of 20.2 fb$^{-1}$, recorded by the ATLAS\ndetector at the LHC. Photon candidates are identified by combining information\nfrom the calorimeters and the inner tracker. The background is subtracted using\na data-driven technique, based on the observed calorimeter shower-shape\nvariables and the deposition of hadronic energy in a narrow cone around the\nphoton candidate. The measured cross sections are compared with leading-order\nand next-to-leading order perturbative QCD calculations and are found to be in\na good agreement over ten orders of magnitude.\n", "  For a compact $ d $-dimensional rectifiable subset of $ \\mathbb{R}^{p} $ we\nstudy asymptotic properties as $ N\\to\\infty $ of $N$-point configurations\nminimizing the energy arising from a Riesz $ s $-potential $ 1/r^s $ and an\nexternal field in the hypersingular case $ s\\geq d$. Formulas for the weak$ ^*\n$ limit of normalized counting measures of such optimal point sets and the\nfirst-order asymptotic values of minimal energy are obtained. As an\napplication, we derive a method for generating configurations whose normalized\ncounting measures converge to a given absolutely continuous measure supported\non a rectifiable subset of $ \\mathbb{R}^{p} $. Results on separation and\ncovering properties of discrete minimizers are given. Our theorems are\nillustrated with several numerical examples.\n", "  The mechanism of unconventional superconductivity in iron-based\nsuperconductors (IBSs) is one of the most intriguing questions in current\nmaterials research. Among non-oxide IBSs, (Ba$_{1-x}$K$_x$)Fe$_2$As$_2$ has\nbeen intensively studied because of its high superconducting transition\ntemperature and fascinating evolution of the superconducting gap structure from\nbeing fully isotropic at optimal doping (\\(x\\approx\\)0.4) to becoming nodal at\n$x > $0.8. Although this marked evolution was identified in several independent\nexperiments, there are no details of the gap evolution to date because of the\nlack of high-quality single crystals covering the entire K-doping range of the\nsuperconducting dome. We conducted a systematic study of the London penetration\ndepth, $\\lambda (T)$, across the full phase diagram for different\nconcentrations of point-like defects introduced by 2.5 MeV electron\nirradiation. Fitting the low-temperature variation with the power law, $\\Delta\n\\lambda \\sim T^{n}$, we find that the exponent $n$ is the highest and $T_c$\nsuppression rate with disorder is the smallest at optimal doping, and they\nevolve with doping being away from optimal, which is consistent with increasing\ngap anisotropy, including an abrupt change around $x\\simeq 0.8$, indicating the\nonset of nodal behavior. Our analysis using a self-consistent $t$-matrix\napproach suggests the ubiquitous and robust nature of s$_{\\pm}$ pairing in IBSs\nand argues against a previously suggested transition to a $d-$wave state near\n$x=1$ in this system.\n", "  Quantum correlations forms a subset of the set of nonsignaling boxes. This\nallows us to characterize quantum correlations as a convex combination of the\nextremal boxes of the nonsignaling polytope which are Popescu-Rohrlich boxes\n(maximally nonlocal boxes) and local deterministic boxes. There exists multiple\ndecomposition of quantum correlations in the context of the nonsignaling\npolytope. I find that the existence of Popescu-Rohrlich box decomposition for\nlocal boxes associates two notions of discord which capture nonclassicality of\nquantum correlations originating from Bell nonlocality and EPR-steering. I\nintroduce, Bell and Mermin discord, and demonstrate that any bipartite\nnonsignaling box admits a three-way decomposition. This decomposition allows us\nto isolate the origin of nonclassicality into three disjoint sources: a\nPopescu-Rohrlich box, a maximally local box that detects EPR-steering, and a\nclassical correlation. Interestingly, I show that all non-null quantum discord\nstates which are neither classical-quantum states nor quantum-classical states\ncan give rise to nonclassical correlations which have non-null Bell and/or\nMermin discord for suitable noncommuting measurements. I introduce two notions\nof genuine discord, which are the generalizations of Bell and Mermin discord to\nthe multipartite boxes, to characterize the presence of genuine nonclassicality\nin multipartite quantum correlations.\n", "  Recent measurements of the dipole anisotropy in the arrival directions of\nGalactic cosmic rays (CRs) indicate a strong energy dependence of the dipole\namplitude and phase in the TeV-PeV range. We argue here that these observations\ncan be well understood within standard diffusion theory as a combined effect of\n(i) one or more local sources at Galactic longitude 120deg < l < 300deg\ndominating the CR gradient below 0.1-0.3 PeV, (ii) the presence of a strong\nordered magnetic field in our local environment, (iii) the relative motion of\nthe solar system, and (iv) the limited reconstruction capabilities of\nground-based observatories. We show that an excellent candidate of the local CR\nsource responsible for the dipole anisotropy at 1-100 TeV is the Vela supernova\nremnant.\n", "  Building on recent advances in defining Wilsonian RG flows, and in particular\nthe notion of scales, for background-independent theories, we present a first\ninvestigation of the renormalization of the 4d spin foam path integral for\nquantum gravity, both analytically and numerically. Focussing on a specific\ntruncation of the model using a hypercubic lattice, we compute the RG flow and\nfind strong indications for a phase transition, as well as an interesting\ninterplay between the different observed phases and the (broken) diffeomorphism\nsymmetry of the model. Most notably, it appears that the critical point between\nthe phases, which is a fixed point of the RG flow, is precisely where broken\ndiffeomorphism symmetry is restored, which suggests that it might allow for the\ndefinition a continuum limit of the quantum gravity theory.\n", "  The emergence of quantum consciousness stems from dynamic flows of hydrogen\nions in brain liquid. This liquid contains vast areas of the fourth phase of\nwater with hexagonal packing of its molecules, the so-called exclusion zone\n(EZ) of water. The hydrogen ion motion on such hexagonal lattices shows as the\nhopping of the ions forward and the holes (vacant places) backward, caused by\nthe Grotthuss mechanism. By supporting this motion using external infrasound\nsources, one may achieve the appearance of the superfluid state of the EZ\nwater. Flows of the hydrogen ions are described by the modified Navier-Stokes\nequation. It, along with the continuity equation, yields the nonlinear\nSchrodinger equation, which describes the quantum effects of these flows, such\nas the tunneling at long distances or the interference on gap junctions.\n", "  The one-loop QCD corrections to the light-front wave-function for the\nquark-antiquark Fock state inside a transverse or longitudinal off-shell photon\nare explicitly calculated, both in full momentum space and in mixed space\n(a.k.a. dipole space). These results provide one of the main contributions to\nvirtual NLO corrections to many DIS observables (inclusive or not) in the\ndipole factorization formalism at low Bjorken x.\n  In a follow-up article, these one-loop corrections are combined with earlier\nresults on the wave-function for the quark-antiquark-gluon Fock state, in order\nto get the full set of NLO corrections to the DIS structure functions $F_2$ and\n$F_L$ in the dipole factorization formalism, valid at low Bjorken x.\n", "  In the Al-Co-Cu alloy system, both the decagonal quasicrystal with the space\ngroup of $P\\overline{10}m2$ and its approximant Al$_{13}$Co$_4$ phase with\nmonoclinic $Cm$ symmetry are present around 20 at.% Co-10 at.% Cu. In this\nstudy, we examined the crystallographic features of prepared Al-(30-x) at.%\nCo-x at.% Cu samples mainly by transmission electron microscopy in order to\nmake clear the crystallographic relation between the decagonal quasicrystal and\nthe monoclinic Al$_{13}$Co$_4$ structure. The results revealed a coexistence\nstate consisting of decagonal quasicrystal and approximant Al$_{13}$Co$_4$\nregions in Al-20 at.% Co-10 at.% Cu alloy samples. With the help of the\ncoexistence state, the orientation relationship was established between the\nmonoclinic Al$_{13}$Co$_4$ structure and the decagonal quasicrystal. In the\ndetermined relationship, the crystallographic axis in the quasicrystal was\nfound to be parallel to the normal direction of the (010)$_{\\rm m}$ plane in\nthe Al$_{13}$Co$_4$ structure, where the subscript m denotes the monoclinic\nsystem. Based on data obtained experimentally, the state stability of the\ndecagonal quasicrystal was also examined in terms of the Hume-Rothery (HR)\nmechanism on the basis of the nearly-free-electron approximation. It was found\nthat a model based on the HR mechanism could explain the crystallographic\nfeatures such as electron diffraction patterns and atomic arrangements found in\nthe decagonal quasicrystal. In other words, the HR mechanism is most likely\nappropriate for the stability of the decagonal quasicrystal in the Al-Co-Cu\nalloy system.\n", "  We construct spectral zeta functions for the Dirac operator on metric graphs.\nWe start with the case of a rose graph, a graph with a single vertex where\nevery edge is a loop. The technique is then developed to cover any finite graph\nwith general energy independent matching conditions at the vertices. The\nregularized spectral determinant of the Dirac operator is also obtained as the\nderivative of the zeta function at a special value. In each case the zeta\nfunction is formulated using a contour integral method, which extends results\nobtained for Laplace and Schrodinger operators on graphs.\n", "  We present results from a search for neutrinoless double-$\\beta$\n($0\\nu\\beta\\beta$) decay using 36.6 g of the isotope $^{150}$Nd with data\ncorresponding to a live time of 5.25 y recorded with the NEMO-3 detector. We\nconstruct a complete background model for this isotope, including a measurement\nof the two-neutrino double-$\\beta$ decay half-life of $T^{2\\nu}_{1/2}=$[9.34\n$\\pm$ 0.22 (stat.) $^{+0.62}_{-0.60}$ (syst.)]$\\times 10^{18}$ y for the ground\nstate transition, which represents the most precise result to date for this\nisotope. We perform a multivariate analysis to search for \\zeronu decays in\norder to improve the sensitivity and, in the case of observation, disentangle\nthe possible underlying decay mechanisms. As no evidence for \\zeronu decay is\nobserved, we derive lower limits on half-lives for several mechanisms involving\nphysics beyond the Standard Model. The observed lower limit, assuming light\nMajorana neutrino exchange mediates the decay, is $T^{0\\nu}_{1/2} >$ 2.0\n$\\times 10^{22}$ y at the 90% C.L., corresponding to an upper limit on the\neffective neutrino mass of $\\langle m_{\\nu} \\rangle$ $<$ 1.6 - 5.3 eV..\n", "  We examine geodesics for scalar-tensor black holes in the Horndeski-Galileon\nnon-minimal kinetic coupling framework. Our analysis shows that bound orbits\nmay not be present within some model parameters range. Using the observational\ndata we pose bounds on possible solution parameter values, as well as initial\nmodel parameters.\n", "  The Internet not only has changed the dynamics of our collective attention,\nbut also through the transactional log of online activities, provides us with\nthe opportunity to study attention dynamics at scale. In this paper, we\nparticularly study attention to aircraft incidents and accidents using\nWikipedia transactional data in two different language editions, English and\nSpanish. We study both the editorial activities on and the viewership of the\narticles about airline crashes. We analyse how the level of attention is\ninfluenced by different parameters such as number of deaths, airline region,\nand event locale and date. We find evidence that the attention given by\nWikipedia editors to pre-Wikipedia aircraft incidents and accidents depends on\nthe region of the airline for both English and Spanish editions. North American\nairline companies receive more prompt coverage in English Wikipedia. We also\nobserve that the attention given by Wikipedia visitors is influenced by the\nairline region but only for events with high number of deaths. Finally we show\nthat the rate and time span of the decay of attention is independent of the\nnumber of deaths and a fast decay within about a week seems to be universal. We\ndiscuss the implications of these findings in the context of attention bias.\n", "  Interfacing s-wave superconductors and quantum spin Hall edges produces\ntime-reversal-invariant topological superconductivity of a type that can not\narise in strictly 1D systems. With the aim of establishing sharp fingerprints\nof this novel phase, we use renormalization group methods to extract universal\ntransport characteristics of superconductor/quantum spin Hall heterostructures\nwhere the native edge states serve as leads. We determine scaling forms for the\nconductance through a grounded superconductor and show that the results depend\nsensitively on the interaction strength in the leads, the size of the\nsuperconducting region, and the presence or absence of time-reversal-breaking\nperturbations. We also study transport across a floating superconducting island\nisolated by magnetic barriers. Here we predict e-periodic Coulomb-blockade\npeaks, as recently observed in nanowire devices [Albrecht et al., Nature 531,\n206 (2016)], with the added feature that the island can support fractional\ncharge tunable via the relative orientation of the barrier magnetizations. As\nan interesting corollary, when the magnetic barriers arise from strong\ninteractions at the edge that spontaneously break time-reversal symmetry, the\nCoulomb-blockade periodicity changes from e to e/2. These findings suggest\nseveral future experiments that probe unique characteristics of topological\nsuperconductivity at the quantum spin Hall edge.\n", "  The optical response of traditional semiconductors depends on the laser\nexcitation power used in experiments. For two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors,\nlaser excitation effects are anticipated to be vastly different due to\ncomplexity added by their ultimate thinness, high surface to volume ratio, and\nlaser-membrane interaction effects. We show in this article that under laser\nexcitation the optical properties of 2D materials undergo irreversible changes.\nMost surprisingly these effects take place even at low steady state excitation,\nwhich is commonly thought to be non-intrusive. In low temperature\nphotoluminescence (PL) we show for monolayer (ML) MoSe2 samples grown by\ndifferent techniques that laser treatment increases significantly the trion\n(i.e. charged exciton) contribution to the emission compared to the neutral\nexciton emission. Comparison between samples exfoliated onto different\nsubstrates shows that laser induced doping is more efficient for ML MoSe2 on\nSiO2/Si compared to h-BN and gold. For ML MoS2 we show that exposure to laser\nradiation with an average power in the $\\mu$W/$\\mu$m$^2$ range does not just\nincrease the trion-to-exciton PL emission ratio, but may result in the\nirreversible disappearance of the neutral exciton PL emission and a shift of\nthe main PL peak to lower energy.\n", "  We introduce a new method of investigating qutrit nonclassicality by\ntranslating qutrit operators to symmetric two-qubit operators. We show that\nthis procedure partially resolves the discrepancy between maximal qutrit\nentanglement and maximal nonclassicality of qutrit correlations. Namely we\nexpress Bell operators corresponding to qutrit Bell inequalities in terms of\nsymmetric two-qubit operators, and analyze the maximal quantum violation of a\ngiven Bell inequality from the qubit perspective. As an example we show that\nthe two-qutrit CGLMP(Collins-Gisin-Linden-Massar-Popescu) Bell inequality can\nbe seen as a combination of Mermin's and CHSH (Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt)\nqubit Bell inequalities, and therefore the optimal state violating this\ncombination differs from the one which corresponds to the maximally entangled\nstate of two qutrits. In addition, we discuss the same problem for a three\nqutrit inequality. We also demonstrate that the maximal quantum violation of\nthe CGLMP inequality follows from complementarity of correlations.\n", "  Within a GIS environment, we combine field measures of mangrove diameter,\nmangrove species distribution, and mangrove density with remotely sensed\nmeasures of mangrove location and mangrove canopy cover to estimate the\nmangrove carbon holdings of northern Ecuador. We find that the four northern\nestuaries of Ecuador contain approximately 7,742,999 t (plus or minus 15.47\npercent) of standing carbon. Of particular high carbon holdings are the\nRhizophora mangle dominated mangrove stands found in-and-around the\nCayapas-Mataje Ecological Reserve in northern Esmeraldas Province, Ecuador and\ncertain stands of Rhizophora mangle in-and-around the Isla Corazon y Fragata\nWildlife Refuge in central Manabi Province, Ecuador. Our field driven mangrove\ncarbon estimate is higher than all but one of the comparison models evaluated.\nWe find that basic latitudinal mangrove carbon models performed at least as\nwell, if not better, than the more complex species based allometric models in\npredicting standing carbon levels. In addition, we find that improved results\noccur when multiple models are combined as opposed to relying any one single\nmodel for mangrove carbon estimates. The high level of carbon contained in\nthese mangrove forests, combined with the future atmospheric carbon\nsequestration potential they offer, makes it a necessity that they are included\nin any future payment for ecosystem services strategy aimed at utilizing forest\nsystems to reduce CO2 emissions and mitigate predicted CO2 driven temperature\nincreases.\n", "  Measurement-based quantum computing (MBQC) is a model of quantum computation\nwhere quantum information is coherently processed by means of projective\nmeasurements on highly entangled states. Following the introduction of MBQC,\ncluster states have been studied extensively both from the theoretical and\nexperimental point of view. Indeed, the study of MBQC was catalysed by the\nrealisation that cluster states are universal for MBQC with (X,Y)-plane and Z\nmeasurements. Here we examine the question of whether the requirement for Z\nmeasurements can be dropped while maintaining universality. We answer this\nquestion in the affirmative by showing that universality is possible in this\nscenario.\n", "  We present an ansatz for the relationship between magnetic flux density and\nfluid vorticity evolution equations. We also suggest that the magnetic flux\ndensity evolution equations be compared to the evolution equation for an\neffective vorticity ($\\omega_{eff}$), which bears a power law relation to the\nordinary vorticity.\n", "  We investigate numerically the inverse participation ratios in a spin-1/2 XXZ\nchain, computed in the \"Ising\" basis (i.e., eigenstates of $\\sigma^z_i$). We\nconsider in particular a quantity $T$, defined by summing the inverse\nparticipation ratios of all the eigenstates in the zero magnetization sector of\na finite chain of length $N$, with open boundary conditions. From a dynamical\npoint of view, $T$ is proportional to the stationary return probability to an\ninitial basis state, averaged over all the basis states (initial conditions).\nWe find that $T$ exhibits an exponential growth, $T\\sim\\exp(aN)$, in the gapped\nphase of the model and a linear scaling, $T\\sim N$, in the gapless phase. These\ntwo different behaviors are analyzed in terms of the distribution of the\nparticipation ratios of individual eigenstates. We also investigate the effect\nof next-nearest-neighbor interactions, which break the integrability of the\nmodel. Although the massive phase of the non-integrable model also has\n$T\\sim\\exp(aN)$, in the gapless phase $T$ appears to saturate to a constant\nvalue.\n", "  A principal scientific goal of the Gemini Planet Imager (GPI) is obtaining\nmilliarcsecond astrometry to constrain exoplanet orbits. However, astrometry of\ndirectly imaged exoplanets is subject to biases, systematic errors, and speckle\nnoise. Here we describe an analytical procedure to forward model the signal of\nan exoplanet that accounts for both the observing strategy (angular and\nspectral differential imaging) and the data reduction method (Karhunen-Lo\\`eve\nImage Projection algorithm). We use this forward model to measure the position\nof an exoplanet in a Bayesian framework employing Gaussian processes and Markov\nchain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to account for correlated noise. In the case of GPI\ndata on $\\beta$ Pic b, this technique, which we call Bayesian KLIP-FM\nAstrometry (BKA), outperforms previous techniques and yields 1$\\sigma$-errors\nat or below the one milliarcsecond level. We validate BKA by fitting a\nKeplerian orbit to twelve GPI observations along with previous astrometry from\nother instruments. The statistical properties of the residuals confirm that BKA\nis accurate and correctly estimates astrometric errors. Our constraints on the\norbit of $\\beta$ Pic b firmly rule out the possibility of a transit of the\nplanet at 10-$\\sigma$ significance. However, we confirm that the Hill sphere of\n$\\beta$ Pic b will transit, giving us a rare chance to probe the\ncircumplanetary environment of a young, evolving exoplanet. We provide an\nephemeris for photometric monitoring of the Hill sphere transit event, which\nwill begin at the start of April in 2017 and finish at the end of January in\n2018.\n", "  The interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) has been shown to\nstabilize homochiral N\\'eel-type domain walls in thin films with perpendicular\nmagnetic anisotropy and as a result permit them to be propagated by a spin Hall\ntorque. In this study, we demonstrate that in Ta/Co$_{20}$Fe$_{60}$B$_{20}$/MgO\nthe DMI may be influenced by annealing. We find that the DMI peaks at\n$D=0.057\\pm0.003$ mJ/m$^{2}$ at an annealing temperature of 230 $^{\\circ}$C.\nDMI fields were measured using a purely field-driven creep regime domain\nexpansion technique. The DMI field and the anisotropy field follow a similar\ntrend as a function of annealing temperature. We infer that the behavior of the\nDMI and the anisotropy are related to interfacial crystal ordering and B\nexpulsion out of the CoFeB layer as the annealing temperature is increased.\n", "  The metal-insulator transitions and the intriguing physical properties of\nrare-earth perovskite nickelates have attracted considerable attention in\nrecent years. Nonetheless, a complete understanding of these materials remains\nelusive. Here, taking a NdNiO3 thin film as a representative example, we\nutilize a combination of x-ray absorption and resonant inelastic x-ray\nscattering (RIXS) spectroscopies to resolve important aspects of the complex\nelectronic structure of the rare-earth nickelates. The unusual coexistence of\nbound and continuum excitations observed in the RIXS spectra provides strong\nevidence for the abundance of oxygen 2p holes in the ground state of these\nmaterials. Using cluster calculations and Anderson impurity model\ninterpretation, we show that these distinct spectral signatures arise from a Ni\n3d8 configuration along with holes in the oxygen 2p valence band, confirming\nsuggestions that these materials do not obey a conventional positive\ncharge-transfer picture, but instead exhibit a negative charge-transfer energy,\nin line with recent models interpreting the metal to insulator transition in\nterms of bond disproportionation.\n", "  We present the first lattice QCD study of coupled-channel $D\\pi$, $D\\eta$ and\n$D_{s}\\bar{K}$ scattering in isospin-1/2 in three partial waves. Using\ndistillation, we compute matrices of correlation functions with bases of\noperators capable of resolving both meson and meson-meson contributions to the\nspectrum. These correlation matrices are analysed using a variational approach\nto extract the finite-volume energy eigenstates. Utilising L\\\"uscher's method\nand its extensions, we constrain scattering amplitudes in $S$, $P$ and $D$-wave\nas a function of energy. By analytically continuing the scattering amplitudes\nto complex energies, we investigate the $S$-matrix singularities. Working at\n$m_\\pi \\approx 391$ MeV, we find a pole corresponding to a $J^{P} = 0^{+}$\nnear-threshold bound state with a large coupling to $D\\pi$. We also find a\ndeeply bound $J^{P} = 1^{-}$ state, and evidence for a $J^{P} = 2^{+}$ narrow\nresonance coupled predominantly to $D\\pi$. Elastic $D\\pi$ scattering in the\nisospin-$3/2$ channel is studied and we find a weakly repulsive interaction in\n$S$-wave.\n", "  We study the effects of the non-attractor initial conditions for the\ncanonical single-field inflation. The non-attractor stage can last only several\n$e$-folding numbers, and should be followed by hilltop inflation. This\ntwo-stage evolution leads to large scale suppression in the primordial power\nspectrum, which is favored by recent observations. Moreover we give a detailed\ncalculation of primordial non-Guassianity due to the \"from non-attractor to\nslow-roll\" transition, and find step features in the local and equilateral\nshapes. We conclude that a plateau-like inflaton potential with an initial\nnon-attractor phase yields interesting features in both power spectrum and\nbispectrum.\n", "  We investigate the effect of Coulomb interactions on the electromagnetic\nresponse of three-dimensional Dirac and Weyl semimetals. In a calculation\nreminiscent of Schwinger's seminal work on quantum electrodynamics, we find\nthree physically distinct effects for the anomalous magnetic moment of the\nrelativisticlike quasiparticles in the semimetal. In the case of nonzero\ndoping, the anomalous magnetic moment is finite at long wavelengths and\ntypically orders of magnitude larger than Schwinger's result. We also find\ninteresting effects of one of the three new Hamiltonian terms on the\ntopological surface states at the interface between vacuum and a Weyl\nsemimetal. We conclude that observation of these effects should be within\nexperimental reach.\n", "  The Dalitz plot analysis technique is used to study the resonant\nsubstructures of $B^{-} \\to D^{+} \\pi^{-} \\pi^{-}$ decays in a data sample\ncorresponding to 3.0 ${\\rm fb}^{-1}$ of $pp$ collision data recorded by the\nLHCb experiment during 2011 and 2012. A model-independent analysis of the\nangular moments demonstrates the presence of resonances with spins 1, 2 and 3\nat high $D^{+}\\pi^{-}$ mass. The data are fitted with an amplitude model\ncomposed of a quasi-model-independent function to describe the $D^{+}\\pi^{-}$\nS-wave together with virtual contributions from the $D^{*}(2007)^{0}$ and\n$B^{*0}$ states, and components corresponding to the $D^{*}_{2}(2460)^{0}$,\n$D^{*}_{1}(2680)^{0}$, $D^{*}_{3}(2760)^{0}$ and $D^{*}_{2}(3000)^{0}$\nresonances. The masses and widths of these resonances are determined together\nwith the branching fractions for their production in $B^{-} \\to D^{+} \\pi^{-}\n\\pi^{-}$ decays. The $D^{+}\\pi^{-}$ S-wave has phase motion consistent with\nthat expected due to the presence of the $D^{*}_{0}(2400)^{0}$ state. These\nresults constitute the first observations of the $D^{*}_{3}(2760)^{0}$ and\n$D^{*}_{2}(3000)^{0}$ resonances.\n", "  The aim of this review paper is to expose a new state of matter exhibited by\nstrongly correlated Fermi systems represented by various heavy-fermion (HF)\nmetals, two-dimensional liquids like $\\rm ^3He$, compounds with quantum spin\nliquids, quasicrystals, and systems with one-dimensional quantum spin liquid.\nWe name these various systems HF compounds, since they exhibit the behavior\ntypical of HF metals. In HF compounds at zero temperature the unique phase\ntransition, dubbed throughout as the fermion condensation quantum phase\ntransition (FCQPT) can occur; this FCQPT creates flat bands which in turn lead\nto the specific state, known as the fermion condensate. Unlimited increase of\nthe effective mass of quasiparticles signifies FCQPT; these quasiparticles\ndetermine the thermodynamic, transport and relaxation properties of HF\ncompounds. Our discussion of numerous salient experimental data within the\nframework of FCQPT resolves the mystery of the new state of matter. Thus, FCQPT\nand the fermion condensation can be considered as the universal reason for the\nnon-Fermi liquid behavior observed in various HF compounds. We show\nanalytically and using arguments based completely on the experimental grounds\nthat these systems exhibit universal scaling behavior of their thermodynamic,\ntransport and relaxation properties. Therefore, the quantum physics of\ndifferent HF compounds is universal, and emerges regardless of the microscopic\nstructure of the compounds. This uniform behavior allows us to view it as the\nmain characteristic of a new state of matter exhibited by HF compounds.\n", "  This article describes the Laser calibration system of the Atlas hadronic\nTile Calorimeter that has been used during the run 1 of the LHC. First, the\nstability of the system associated readout electronics is studied. It is found\nto be stable with variations smaller than 0.6 %. Then, the method developed to\ncompute the calibration constants, to correct for the variations of the gain of\nthe calorimeter photomultipliers, is described. These constants were determined\nwith a statistical uncertainty of 0.3 % and a systematic uncertainty of 0.2 %\nfor the central part of the calorimeter and 0.5 % for the end-caps. Finally,\nthe detection and correction of timing mis-configuration of the Tile\nCalorimeter using the Laser system are also presented.\n", "  We report the experimental details of how mechanical detwinning can be\nimplemented in tandem with high sensitivity nuclear magnetic resonance\nmeasurements and use this setup to measure the in-plane anisotropy of the\nspin-lattice relaxation rate in underdoped Ba(Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_{x}$)$_{2}$As$_{2}$\nwith $x=0.048$. The anisotropy reaches a maximum of 30\\% at $T_{N}$, and the\nrecovery data reveal that the glassy behavior of the spin fluctuations present\nin the twinned state persist in the fully detwinned crystal. A theoretical\nmodel is presented to describe the spin-lattice relaxation rate in terms of\nanisotropic nematic spin fluctuations.\n", "  The response of a many body system to a time dependent coupling which passes\nthrough or approaches a critical point displays universal scaling behavior. In\nsome regimes, scaling laws have been known since the 1970's. Recently\nholographic techniques have been used to understand the origins of such\nscaling. Along the way, new scaling behaviors in other regimes have been found\nin holographic models, which have later been shown to hold in a generic field\ntheory regardless of holography. This contribution summarizes recent work on\nthese various scaling regimes.\n", "  In this article we present a theoretical construction of spacetimes with a\nthin shell that joins two different local cosmic string geometries. We study\ntwo types of global manifolds, one representing spacetimes with a thin shell\nsurrounding a cosmic string or an empty region with Minkowski metric, and the\nother corresponding to wormholes which are not symmetric across the throat\nlocated at the shell. We analyze the stability of the static configurations\nunder perturbations preserving the cylindrical symmetry. For both types of\ngeometries we find that the static configurations can be stable for suitable\nvalues of the parameters.\n", "  The effect of dipolar orientation with respect to the condensate plane on the\nmean-field dynamics of dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates in a pancake-shaped\nconfinement is discussed. The stability of a quasi-two-dimensional condensate,\nwith respect to the tilting angle, is found to be different from a\ntwo-dimensional layer of dipoles, indicating the relevance of the transverse\nextension while characterizing two-dimensional dipolar systems. An anisotropic\nexcitation spectrum exhibiting a highly tunable, rotonlike minimum can arise\nentirely from the dipole-dipole interactions, by tilting the dipoles. At the\nmagic angle and in the absence of contact interactions, the long-wavelength\nexcitations are not phononlike and always unstable. The post-roton-instability\ndynamics, in contrast to phonon instability, in a uniform condensate, is\nfeatured by a transient, defect-free, stripe pattern, which eventually\nundergoes local collapses, and driving the condensate back into the stable\nregime can make them sustained for longer. Hopping between stripes has been\nobserved before it melts into a uniform state in the presence of dissipation.\nFinally, we discuss a class of solutions, in which a quasi-two-dimensional\ncondensate is self-trapped in one direction, as well as a regime of interaction\nparameters, including attractive short-range interactions, at which a\ntwo-dimensional anisotropic soliton can be stabilized, and we show that a\nchromium condensate with a relatively small number of atoms is well suited for\nthis.\n", "  Actual solutions of the Bethe-Salpeter equation for a two-fermion bound\nsystem are becoming available directly in Minkowski space, by virtue of a novel\ntechnique, based on the so-called Nakanishi integral representation of the\nBethe-Salpeter amplitude and improved by expressing the relevant momenta\nthrough light-front components, i.e. $k^\\pm=k^0 \\pm k^3$. We solve a crucial\nproblem that widens the applicability of the method to real situations by\nproviding an analytically exact treatment of the singularities plaguing the\ntwo-fermion problem in Minkowski space, irrespective of the complexity of the\nirreducible Bethe-Salpeter kernel. This paves the way for feasible numerical\ninvestigations of relativistic composite systems, with any spin degrees of\nfreedom. We present a thorough comparison with existing numerical results,\nevaluated in both Minkowski and Euclidean space, fully corroborating our\nanalytical treatment, as well as fresh light-front amplitudes illustrating the\npotentiality of non perturbative calculations performed directly in Minkowski\nspace.\n", "  Topological semimetals are three-dimensional topological states of matter, in\nwhich the conduction and valence bands touch at a finite number of points,\ni.e., the Weyl nodes. Topological semimetals host paired monopoles and\nantimonopoles of Berry curvature at the Weyl nodes and topologically protected\nFermi arcs at certain surfaces. We review our recent works on quantum transport\nin topological semimetals, according to the strength of the magnetic field. At\nweak magnetic fields, there are competitions between the positive\nmagnetoresistivity induced by the weak anti-localization effect and negative\nmagnetoresistivity related to the nontrivial Berry curvature. We propose a\nfitting formula for the magnetoconductivity of the weak anti-localization. We\nexpect that the weak localization may by induced by inter- alley effects and\ninteraction effect, and occur in double-Weyl semimetals. For the negative\nmagnetoresistance induced by the nontrivial Berry curvature in topological\nsemimetals, we show the dependence of the negative magnetoresistance on the\ncarrier density. At strong magnetic fields, specifically, in the quantum limit,\nthe magnetoconduction depends on the type and range of the scattering potential\nof disorder. The high-field positive magnetoconductivity may not be a\ncompelling signature of the chiral anomaly. For long-range Gaussian scattering\npotential and half filling, the magnetoconductivity can be linear in the\nquantum limit. A minimal conductivity is found at the Weyl nodes although the\ndensity of states vanishes there.\n", "  We consider a novel model for three standard families of left chiral states\nof quarks and leptons conjointly with a new family of dark matter fermionic\nparticles and a sterile neutrino. It is suggested to use a SO(10) symmetry for\ndescription of these families for the first time. It is presented estimations\nof masses of dark matter particles and the sterile neutrino as well limitations\nfor values of mixing parameters between the new family particles and active\nneutrinos. This model can be used for predictions and interpretations of\nresults of experiments for sterile neutrino and dark matter particles search.\n", "  An extreme dissipation event in the bulk of a closed three-dimensional\nturbulent convection cell is found to be correlated with a strong reduction of\nthe large-scale circulation flow in the system that happens at the same time as\na plume emission event from the bottom plate. The reduction in the large-scale\ncirculation opens the possibility for a nearly frontal collision of down- and\nupwelling plumes and the generation of a high-amplitude thermal dissipation\nlayer in the bulk. This collision is locally connected to a subsequent\nhigh-amplitude energy dissipation event in the form of a strong shear layer.\nOur analysis illustrates the impact of transitions in the large-scale\nstructures on extreme events at the smallest scales of the turbulence, a direct\nlink that is observed in a flow with boundary layers. We also show that\ndetection of extreme dissipation events which determine the far-tail statistics\nof the dissipation fields in the bulk requires long-time integrations of the\nequations of motion over at least hundred convective time units.\n", "  We present the relaxation dynamics of glass-forming glycerol mixed with 1.1\nnm sized polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS) molecules using dielectric\nspectroscopy (DS) and two different neutron scattering (NS) techniques. Both,\nthe reorientational dynamics as measured by DS and the density fluctuations\ndetected by NS reveal a broadening of the alpha relaxation when POSS molecules\nare added. Moreover, we find a significant slowing down of the alpha-relaxation\ntime. These effects are in accord with the heterogeneity scenario considered\nfor the dynamics of glasses and supercooled liquids. The addition of POSS also\naffects the excess wing in glycerol arising from a secondary relaxation\nprocess, which seems to exhibit a dramatic increase in relative strength\ncompared to the alpha-relaxation.\n", "  We investigated spin Hall magnetoresistance in FeMn/Pt bilayers, which was\nfound to be one order of magnitude larger than that of heavy metal and\ninsulating ferromagnet or antiferromagnet bilayer systems, and comparable to\nthat of NiFe/Pt bilayers. The spin Hall magnetoresistance shows a non-monotonic\ndependence on the thicknesses of both FeMn and Pt. The former can be accounted\nfor by the thickness dependence of net magnetization in FeMn thin films,\nwhereas the latter is mainly due to spin accumulation and diffusion in Pt.\nThrough analysis of the Pt thickness dependence, the spin Hall angle, spin\ndiffusion length of Pt and the real part of spin mixing conductance were\ndetermined to be 0.2, 1.1 nm, and $5.5 * 10^{14} {\\Omega}^{-1} m^{-2}$,\nrespectively. The results corroborate the spin orbit torque effect observed in\nthis system recently.\n", "  We present new quantum algorithms for Triangle Finding improving its best\npreviously known quantum query complexities for both dense and spare\ninstances.For dense graphs on $n$ vertices, we get a query complexity of\n$O(n^{5/4})$ without any of the extra logarithmic factors present in the\nprevious algorithm of Le Gall [FOCS'14]. For sparse graphs with $m\\geq n^{5/4}$\nedges, we get a query complexity of $O(n^{11/12}m^{1/6}\\sqrt{\\log n})$, which\nis better than the one obtained by Le Gall and Nakajima [ISAAC'15] when $m \\geq\nn^{3/2}$. We also obtain an algorithm with query complexity ${O}(n^{5/6}(m\\log\nn)^{1/6}+d_2\\sqrt{n})$ where $d_2$ is the variance of the degree distribution.\nOur algorithms are designed and analyzed in a new model of learning graphs that\nwe call extended learning graphs. In addition, we present a framework in order\nto easily combine and analyze them. As a consequence we get much simpler\nalgorithms and analyses than previous algorithms of Le Gall {\\it et al} based\non the MNRS quantum walk framework [SICOMP'11].\n", "  In this paper, we will analyse the holographic complexity for time-dependent\nasymptotically $AdS$ geometries. We will first use a covariant zero mean\ncurvature slicing of the time-dependent bulk geometries, and then use this\nco-dimension one spacelike slice of the bulk spacetime to define a co-dimension\ntwo minimal surface. The time-dependent holographic complexity will be defined\nusing the volume enclosed by this minimal surface. This time-dependent\nholographic complexity will reduce to the usual holographic complexity for\nstatic geometries. We will analyse the time-dependence as a perturbation of the\nasymptotically $AdS$ geometries. Thus, we will obtain time-dependent\nasymptotically $AdS$ geometries, and we will calculate the holographic\ncomplexity for such a time-dependent geometries.\n", "  We discuss the unification of gauge coupling constants in non-supersymmetric\nopen string vacua that possess the properties of Split Supersymmetry, namely\nthe Standard Model with Higgsinos at low energies and where the Standard model\nspectrum is always accompanied by right handed neutrinos. These vacua achieve\npartial unification of two out of three (namely SU(3)$_c$, SU(2), U(1)) running\ngauge couplings, possess massive gauginos and light Higgsinos at low energies\nand also satisfy $sin^2\\theta_w (M_s) = 3/8$. These vacua are based on four\ndimensional orbifold $Z_3 \\times Z_3$ compactifications of string IIA\norientifolds with D6-branes intersecting at angles, where the (four\ndimensional) chiral fermions of the Standard Model appear as opens strings\nstreching between the intersections of seven dimensional objects the so called\nD6-branes.\n", "  We use the spinor helicity formalism in order to derive the dyadic forms for\nmassless fields of various spins. We also give an iterated form of this\napproach in case higher spin theories are under study. This reduces\ncalculations at hard and soft scattering problems in gauge theories\ndrastically. Finally, we state and prove a theorem of gauge symmetry violation\nin the presence of minimal coupling with light in higher spin theories\n($j>1/2$).\n", "  In this Rapid Communication we investigate the coupling between excited\nelectrons and phonons in the highly anisotropic electronic structure of the\nprototypical topological insulator Bi$_2$Te$_3$. Using time- and angle-resolved\nphotoemission spectroscopy we are able to identify the emergence and ultrafast\ntemporal evolution of the longitudinal-optical A$_{1g}$ coherent-phonon mode in\nBi$_2$Te$_3$. We observe an antiphase behavior in the onset of the\ncoherent-phonon oscillations between the $\\overline{\\Gamma K}$ and the\n$\\overline{\\Gamma M}$ high-symmetry directions that is consistent with warping.\nThe qualitative agreement between our density-functional theory calculations\nand the experimental results reveals the critical role of the anisotropic\ncoupling between Dirac fermions and phonon modes in the topological insulator\nBi$_2$Te$_3$.\n", "  We propose a new diagram, the Kinematic-Excitation diagram (KEx diagram),\nwhich uses the [OIII]/H\\beta\\ line ratio and the [OIII]5007 emission line width\n(\\sigma_{[OIII]}) to diagnose the ionization source and physical properties of\nthe Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) and the star-forming galaxies (SFGs). The KEx\ndiagram is a suitable tool to classify emission-line galaxies (ELGs) at\nintermediate redshift because it uses only the [OIII]5007 and H\\beta\\ emission\nlines. We use the SDSS DR7 main galaxy sample and the\nBaldwin-Phillips-Terlevich (BPT) diagnostic to calibrate the diagram at low\nredshift. We find that the diagram can be divided into 3 regions: one occupied\nmainly by the pure AGNs (KEx-AGN region), one dominated by composite galaxies\n(KEx-composite region), and one contains mostly SFGs (KEx-SFG region). AGNs are\nseparated from SFGs in this diagram mainly because they preferentially reside\nin luminous and massive galaxies and have high [OIII]/H\\beta. The separation of\nAGN from star-forming galaxies is even cleaner thanks to the additional\n0.15/0.12 dex offset in [OIII] line width at fixed luminosity/stellar mass. We\napply the KEx diagram to 7,866 galaxies at 0.3 < z < 1 in the DEEP2 Galaxy\nRedshift Survey, and compare it to an independent X-ray classification scheme\nusing Chandra observation. X-ray AGNs are mostly located in the KEx-AGN region\nwhile X-ray SFGs are mostly located in the KEx-SFG region. Almost all of Type1\nAGNs lie in the KEx-AGN region. These confirm the reliability of this\nclassification diagram for emission line galaxies at intermediate redshift. At\nz~2, the demarcation line between star-forming galaxies and AGNs should shift\n0.3 dex higher in \\sigma_{[OIII]} to account for evolution.\n", "  We investigate the self-induced turbulence of high repetition rate laser\nfilaments over a wide range of average powers (1 mW to 100 W) and its\nsensitivity to external atmospheric turbulence. Although both\nexternally-imposed and self-generated turbulences can have comparable\nmagnitudes, they act on different temporal and spatial scales. While the former\ndrives the shot-to-shot motion at the millisecond time scale, the latter acts\non the 0.5 s scale. As a consequence, their effects are decoupled, preventing\nbeam stabilization by the thermally-induced low-density channel produced by the\nlaser filaments.\n", "  Metallic structures with periodic array of slits are well-known to lead to\nextraordinary power transmission, when slits have dimensions much less than the\nwavelength of incident optical wave. Excellent power transmission originates\nfrom surface waves excited by incident transverse magnetic wave. Here we show\nthat metallic structure with array of stepped-slits can transmit power of\nincident wave into the substrate at desired optical frequency entirely and\nsimultaneously in terahertz frequency band by 70%, for In0.53Ga0.47As\nsubstrate. Transmitted power of the proposed structure is studied both in a\nclosed-form by an analytical model as well as numerically by finite element\nmethod. It is found that with the increase of field intensity in the substrate,\nstructure with array of stepped-slits (as opposed to uniform-slits) favorably\nhas no reduction of frequency range at maximum transmitted power.\n", "  A liquid drop impacting a smooth solid substrate splashes by emitting a thin\nliquid sheet from near the contact line of the spreading liquid. This sheet is\nlifted from the substrate and ultimately breaks apart. Surprisingly, the splash\nis caused by the ambient gas, whose properties dictate when and if the sheet is\ncreated. Here I focus on two aspects of this process. Using high-speed imaging\nI find that the time of thin-sheet creation displays a different quantitative\ndependence on air pressure if the sheet is created during the early stages of\nspreading, rather than when the liquid has already spread to a large radius.\nThis result sheds light on previously observed impact velocity regimes.\nAdditionally, by measuring impacts of drops on surfaces comprised of both rough\nand smooth regions, I identify a new threshold velocity that limits the times\nat which the thin sheet can be created. This velocity determines the threshold\npressure below which splashing is suppressed.\n", "  In this thesis we focus on Gaussian quantum metrology in the phase-space\nformalism and its applications in quantum sensing and the estimation of\nspace-time parameters. We derive new formulae for the optimal estimation of\nmultiple parameters encoded into Gaussian states. We discuss the discontinuous\nbehavior of the figure of merit - the quantum Fisher information. Using derived\nexpressions we devise a practical method of finding optimal probe states for\nthe estimation of Gaussian channels and we illustrate this method on several\nexamples. We show that the temperature of a probe state affects the estimation\ngenerically and always appears in the form of four multiplicative factors. We\nalso discuss how well squeezed thermal states perform in the estimation of\nspace-time parameters. Finally we study how the estimation precision changes\nwhen two parties exchanging a quantum state with the encoded parameter do not\nshare a reference frame. We show that using a quantum reference frame could\ncounter this effect.\n", "  These notes, based on lectures given at the summer school on Asymptotic\nAnalysis in General Relativity, collect material on the Einstein equations, the\ngeometry of black hole spacetimes, and the analysis of fields on black hole\nbackgrounds. The Kerr model of a rotating black hole in vacuum is expected to\nbe unique and stable. The problem of proving these fundamental facts provides\nthe background for the material presented in these notes.\n  Among the many topics which are relevant for the uniqueness and stability\nproblems are the theory of fields on black hole spacetimes, in particular for\ngravitational perturbations of the Kerr black hole, and more generally, the\nstudy of nonlinear field equations in the presence of trapping. The study of\nthese questions requires tools from several different fields, including\nLorentzian geometry, hyperbolic differential equations and spin geometry, which\nare all relevant to the black hole stability problem.\n", "  Aaronson and Drucker (2011) asked whether there exists a quantum finite\nautomaton that can distinguish fair coin tosses from biased ones by spending\nsignificantly more time in accepting states, on average, given an infinite\nsequence of tosses. We answer this question negatively.\n", "  Quantum information processing with hybrid protocols making use of discrete-\nand continuous-variable currently attracts of great interest because of its\npromising applications in scalable quantum computer and distant quantum\nnetwork. By inducing a giant cross-Kerr nonlinearity between two cavities, we\npropose a general protocol for hybrid quantum gate and quantum entanglement\nwith high fidelity between a stationary, discrete photonic qubit and a flying\nphotonic state. Interestingly, our protocol can be used to conduct a\ncontrolled-Z quantum gate between a stationary microwave photon stored in a\nslowly-decaying microwave cavity and a flying optical photon, and therefore\nenable to build quantum network for distant superconducting quantum circuits.\n", "  We define single quantum dots of lengths varying from 60 nm up to nearly half\na micron in Ge-Si core-shell nanowires. The charging energies scale inversely\nwith the quantum dot length between 18 and 4 meV. Subsequently, we split up a\nlong dot into a double quantum dot with a separate control over the tunnel\ncouplings and the electrochemical potential of each dot. Both single and double\nquantum dot configurations prove to be very stable and show excellent control\nover the electrostatic environment of the dots, making this system a highly\nversatile platform for spin-based quantum computing.\n", "  We present a model for computing the surface force density on a fluid\nellipsoid in simple shear flow, which we derive by coupling existing models for\nthe shape of a fluid droplet and the surface force density on a solid\nellipsoid. The primary contribution of this coupling is to develop a method to\ncompute the force acting against a plane intersecting the ellipsoid, which we\ncall the fragmentation force. The model can be used to simulate the motion,\nshape, surface force density, and breakage of fluid droplets and colloidal\naggregates in shear flow.\n", "  The noninteracting electronic structures of tight binding models on bipartite\nlattices with unequal numbers of sites in the two sublattices have a number of\nunique features, including the presence of spatially localized eigenstates and\nflat bands. When a \\emph{uniform} on-site Hubbard interaction $U$ is turned on,\nLieb proved rigorously that at half filling ($\\rho=1$) the ground state has a\nnon-zero spin. In this paper we consider a `CuO$_2$ lattice (also known as\n`Lieb lattice', or as a decorated square lattice), in which `$d$-orbitals'\noccupy the vertices of the squares, while `$p$-orbitals' lie halfway between\ntwo $d$-orbitals. We use exact Determinant Quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC)\nsimulations to quantify the nature of magnetic order through the behavior of\ncorrelation functions and sublattice magnetizations in the different orbitals\nas a function of $U$ and temperature. We study both the homogeneous (H) case,\n$U_d= U_p$, originally considered by Lieb, and the inhomogeneous (IH) case,\n$U_d\\neq U_p$. For the H case at half filling, we found that the global\nmagnetization rises sharply at weak coupling, and then stabilizes towards the\nstrong-coupling (Heisenberg) value, as a result of the interplay between the\nferromagnetism of like sites and the antiferromagnetism between unlike sites;\nwe verified that the system is an insulator for all $U$. For the IH system at\nhalf filling, we argue that the case $U_p\\neq U_d$ falls under Lieb's theorem,\nprovided they are positive definite, so we used DQMC to probe the cases\n$U_p=0,U_d=U$ and $U_p=U, U_d=0$. We found that the different environments of\n$d$ and $p$ sites lead to a ferromagnetic insulator when $U_d=0$; by contrast,\n$U_p=0$ leads to to a metal without any magnetic ordering. In addition, we have\nalso established that at density $\\rho=1/3$, strong antiferromagnetic\ncorrelations set in, caused by the presence of one fermion on each $d$ site.\n", "  The noncontact (van der Waals) friction is an interesting physical effect\nwhich has been the subject of controversial scientific discussion. The \"direct\"\nfriction term due to the thermal fluctuations of the electromagnetic field\nleads to a friction force proportional to 1/Z^5 where Z is the atom-wall\ndistance). The \"backaction\" friction term takes into account the feedback of\nthermal fluctuations of the atomic dipole moment onto the motion of the atom\nand scales as 1/Z^8. We investigate noncontact friction effects for the\ninteractions of hydrogen, ground-state helium and metastable helium atoms with\nalpha-quartz (SiO_2), gold (Au) and calcium difluorite (CaF_2). We find that\nthe backaction term dominates over the direct term induced by the thermal\nelectromagnetic fluctuations inside the material, over wide distance ranges.\nThe friction coefficients obtained for gold are smaller than those for SiO_2\nand CaF_2 by several orders of magnitude.\n", "  Because of the strong inherent resonances, the giant optical activity\nobtained via chiral metamaterials generally suffers from high dispersion, which\nhas been a big stumbling block to broadband applications. In this paper, we\npropose a type of chiral metamaterial consisting of interconnected metal helix\nstructures with four-fold symmetry, which exhibits nonresonant Drude-like\nresponse and can therefore avoid the highly dispersive optical activity\nresulting from resonances. It shows that the well-designed chiral metamaterial\ncan achieve nondispersive and pure optical activity with high transmittance in\na broadband frequency range. And the optical activity of multi-layer chiral\nmetamaterials is proportional to the layer numbers of single-layer chiral\nmetamaterial. Most remarkably, the broadband behaviors of nondispersive optical\nactivity and high transmission are insensitive to the incident angles of\nelectromagnetic waves and permittivity of dielectric substrate, thereby\nenabling more flexibility in polarization manipulation.\n", "  Recently, we studied the magic wavelength for the atomic hydrogen 1S-2S\ntransition [A.K., Phys. Rev. A 92, 042507 (2015)]. An explicit summation over\nvirtual atomic states of the discrete part of the hydrogen spectrum was\nperformed to evaluate the atomic polarizability. In this paper, we supplement\nthe contribution of the continuum part of the spectrum and add the reduced-mass\ncorrection. The magic wavelength, at which the lowest-order ac Stark shifts of\nthe 1S and 2S states are equal, is found to be equal to 514.6 nm. The ac Stark\nshift at the magic wavelength is -221.6 Hz / (kW/cm^2), and the slope of the ac\nStark shift at the magic wavelength under a change of the driving laser\nfrequency is -0.2157 Hz/ (GHz kW/cm^2).\n", "  Cuprate high temperature superconductors consist of two quasi-two-dimensional\n(2D) substructures: CuO2 superconducting layers and charge reservoir layers.\nThe superconductivity is realized by charge transfer from the charge reservoir\nlayers into the superconducting layers without chemical dopants and defects\nbeing introduced into the latter, similar to modulation-doping in semiconductor\nsuperlattices of AlGaAs/GaAs. Inspired by this scheme, we have been searching\nfor high temperature superconductivity in ultrathin films of superconductors\nepitaxially grown on semiconductor/oxide substrates since 2008. We have\nobserved interface enhanced superconductivity in both conventional and\nunconventional superconducting films, including single atomic layer films of Pb\nand In on Si substrates and single unit cell (UC) films of FeSe on SrTiO3 (STO)\nsubstrates. The discovery of high temperature superconductivity with a\nsuperconducting gap of ~20 meV in 1UC-FeSe/STO has stimulated tremendous\ninterest in superconductivity community, for it opens new avenue for both\nraising superconducting transition temperature and understanding the pairing\nmechanism of unconventional high temperature superconductivity. Here, we review\nmainly the experimental progress on interface enhanced superconductivity in the\nthree systems mentioned above with emphasis on 1UC-FeSe/STO, studied by\nscanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy, angle-resolved photoemission\nspectroscopy and transport experiments. We discuss the roles of interfaces and\npossible pairing mechanism inferred from those studies.\n", "  Optical orbital angular momentum (OAM) provides an additional dimension for\nphotons to carry information in high-capacity optical communication. Although\nthe practical needs have intrigued the generations of miniaturized devices to\nmanipulate the OAM modes in various integrated platforms, the on-chip OAM\ndetection is still challenging to match the newly-developed compact OAM emitter\nand OAM transmission fiber. Here, we demonstrate an ultra-compact device, i.e.,\na single plasmonic nanohole, to efficiently measure an optical beam's OAM state\nin a nondestructive way. The device size is reduced down to a few hundreds of\nnanometers, which can be easily fabricated and installed in the current OAM\ndevices. It is a flexible and robust way for in-situ OAM monitoring and\ndetection in optical fiber networks and long-distance optical communication\nsystems. With proper optimization of the nanohole parameters, this approach\ncould be further extended to discriminate the OAM information multiplexed in\nmultiple wavelengths and polarizations.\n", "  Activation cross-sections of deuterons induced reactions on Nb targets were\ndetermined with the aim of different applications and comparison with\ntheoretical models.\n", "  We derive an expression for the reduced density matrices of ideal Bose and\nFermi gases in the canonical ensemble, which corresponds to the Bloch--De\nDominicis (or Wick's) theorem in the grand canonical ensemble for\nnormal-ordered products of operators. Using this expression, we study one- and\ntwo-body correlations of homogeneous ideal gases with $N$ particles. The pair\ndistribution function $g^{(2)}(r)$ of fermions clearly exhibits antibunching\nwith $g^{(2)}(0)=0$ due to the Pauli exclusion principle at all temperatures,\nwhereas that of normal bosons shows bunching with $g^{(2)}(0)\\approx 2$,\ncorresponding to the Hanbury Brown--Twiss effect. For bosons below the\nBose--Einstein condensation temperature $T_0$, an off-diagonal long-range order\ndevelops in the one-particle density matrix to reach $g^{(1)}(r)=1$ at $T=0$,\nand the pair correlation starts to decrease towards $g^{(2)}(r)\\approx 1$ at\n$T=0$. The results for $N\\rightarrow \\infty$ are seen to converge to those of\nthe grand canonical ensemble obtained by assuming the average\n$\\langle\\hat\\psi({\\bf r})\\rangle$ of the field operator $\\hat\\psi({\\bf r})$\nbelow $T_0$. This fact justifies the introduction of the \"anomalous\" average\n$\\langle\\hat\\psi({\\bf r})\\rangle\\neq 0$ below $T_0$ in the grand canonical\nensemble as a mathematical means of removing unphysical particle-number\nfluctuations to reproduce the canonical results in the thermodynamic limit.\n", "  Modifications of gravity have been considered to model the primordial\ninflation and the late-time cosmic acceleration. Provided that modified gravity\nmodels do not suffer from theoretical instabilities, they must be confronted\nwith observations, not only at the cosmological scales, but also with the local\ntests of gravity, in the lab and in the Solar System, as well as at the\nastrophysical scales. Considering in particular sub-classes of the Horndeski\ngravity, we study their observational predictions at different scales. In order\nto pass the local tests of gravity while allowing for long-range interactions\nin cosmology, Horndeski gravity exhibits screening mechanisms, among them the\nchameleon. The chameleon screening mechanism has been tested recently using\natom interferometry in a vacuum chamber. Numerical simulations are provided in\nthis thesis in order to refine the analytical predictions. At the astrophysical\nscale, Horndeski gravity predicts a variation of the gravitational coupling\ninside compact stars. Focusing on Higgs inflation, we discuss to what extent\nthe Higgs vacuum expectation value varies inside stars and conclude whether the\neffect is detectable in gravitational and nuclear physics. Finally, the\ncovariant Galileon model exhibits non-linearities in the scalar field kinetic\nterm such that it might pass the local tests of gravity thanks to the\nVainshtein screening mechanism. We discuss if a sub-class of the covariant\nGalileon theory dubbed the Fab Four model leads to a viable inflationary phase\nand provide combined analysis with neutron stars and Solar System observables.\n", "  Among the early B-type stars, He-rich Bp stars exhibit the strongest\nlarge-scale organized magnetic fields with a predominant dipole contribution.\nThe presence of $\\beta$ Cep-like pulsations in the typical magnetic early\nBp-type star HD 96446 was announced a few years ago, but the analysis of the\nmagnetic field geometry was hampered by the absence of a reliable rotation\nperiod and a sophisticated procedure for accounting for the impact of\npulsations on the magnetic field measurements. Using new spectropolarimetric\nobservations and a recently determined rotation period based on an extensive\nspectroscopic time series, we investigate the magnetic field model parameters\nof this star under more detailed considerations of the pulsation behaviour of\nthe line profiles.\n", "  Demonstrating quantum supremacy, a complexity-guaranteed quantum advantage\nagainst over the best classical algorithms by using less universal quantum\ndevices, is an important near-term milestone for quantum information\nprocessing. Here we develop a threshold theorem for quantum supremacy with\nnoisy quantum circuits in the pre-threshold region, where quantum error\ncorrection does not work directly. We show that, even in such a region, we can\nvirtually simulate quantum error correction by postselection. This allows us to\nshow that the output sampled from the noisy quantum circuits (without\npostselection) cannot be simulated efficiently by classical computers based on\na stable complexity theoretical conjecture, i.e., non-collapse of the\npolynomial hierarchy. By applying this to fault-tolerant quantum computation\nwith the surface codes, we obtain the threshold value $2.84\\%$ for quantum\nsupremacy, which is much higher than the standard threshold $0.75\\%$ for\nuniversal fault-tolerant quantum computation with the same circuit-level noise\nmodel. Moreover, contrast to the standard noise threshold, the origin of\nquantum supremacy in noisy quantum circuits is quite clear; the threshold is\ndetermined purely by the threshold of magic state distillation, which is\nessential to gain a quantum advantage.\n", "  A method is proposed for the analysis of the propagation of electromagnetic\nwaves through a homogeneous slab of a medium with Drude-Lorentz dispersion\nbehavior, and excited by a causal sinusoidal source. An expression of the time\ndependent field, free from branch-cuts in the plane of complex frequencies, is\nestablished. This method provides the complete temporal response in both the\nsteady-state and transient regimes in terms of discrete poles contributions.\nThe Sommerfeld and Brillouin precursors are retrieved and the corresponding set\nof poles are identified. In addition, the contribution in the transient field\nof the resonance frequency in the Drude-Lorentz model is exhybited, and the\neffect of reflections resulting from the refractive index mismatch at the\ninterfaces of the slab are analyzed.\n", "  The present review gives an overview of the highlights of more than 10 years\nof research on synthesis and applications of ordered oxide structures (nanotube\nlayers, hexagonal pore arrangements) that are formed by self-organizing\nanodization of metals. In particular we address the questions after the\ncritical factors that lead to the spectacular self-ordering during the growth\nof anodic oxides that finally yield morphologies such as highly ordered TiO2\nnanotube arrays and similar structures. Why are tubes and pores formed - what\nare the key parameters controlling these processes?\n", "  Plasmon hybridization between closely spaced nanoparticles yields new hybrid\nmodes not found in individual constituents, allowing for the engineering of\nresonance properties and field enhancement capabilities of metallic\nnanostructure. Experimental verifications of plasmon hybridization have been\nthus far mostly limited to optical frequencies, as metals cannot support\nsurface plasmons at longer wavelengths. Here, we introduce the concept of\n'spoof plasmon hybridization' in highly conductive metal structures and\ninvestigate experimentally the interaction of localized surface plasmon\nresonances (LSPR) in adjacent metal disks corrugated with subwavelength spiral\npatterns. We show that the hybridization results in the splitting of spoof\nplasmon modes into bonding and antibonding resonances analogous to molecular\norbital rule and plasmonic hybridization in optical spectrum. These hybrid\nmodes can be manipulated to produce enormous field enhancements (larger than\n5000) by tuning the separation between disks or alternatively, the disk size,\nwhich effectively changes the relative gap size. The impact of the radiation\nloss is considered to find out the optimum disk size that maximizes field\nenhancement capabilities. Our investigation not only extends the range of\napplicability of the hybridization model, but also provides insightful guidance\nto exporting the exciting applications associated with plasmon hybridization to\nlower spectral range.\n", "  The coexistent physics of de Rham-Gabada-dze-Tolley (dRGT) massive black\nholes and holographic massive black holes is investigated in the extended phase\nspace where the cosmological constant is viewed as pressure. Van der Waals like\nphase transitions are found for both of them. Coexistent curves of reduced\npressure and reduced temperature are found to be different from that of RN-AdS\nblack holes. Coexistent curves of reduced Gibbs free energy and reduced\npressure show that Gibbs free energy in the canonical ensemble decreases\nmonotonically with the increasing pressure. The concept number density is\nintroduced to study the coexistent physics. It is uncovered that with the\nincreasing pressure, the number densities of small black holes (SBHs) and large\nblack holes (LBHs) change monotonically in the contrary directions till finally\nreaching the same value at the critical points of the phase transitions. In\nother words, with the increasing pressure the number density differences\nbetween SBHs and LBHs decrease monotonically before disappearance at the\ncritical points. Further more, HEPM thermodynamic scalar curvature differences\nbetween SBHs and LBHs are found to decrease monotonically to zero when\napproaching to the critical points, which is similar as a RN-AdS black hole. We\npropose that both the number density difference and the HEPM scalar curvature\ndifference can be order parameters describing the SBH/LBH phase transition and\njudging the upcoming of critical point where a second-order phase transition\ntakes place. These results provide us with new recognition of the massive\ngravity. The thermodynamics in the extended phase space of AdS black holes is\nenriched.\n", "  Understanding the physics of phase-separation between solid and fluid phases\nas a mixture mass moves down slope is a long-standing challenge. Here, we\npropose an extension of the two phase mass flow model (Pudasaini, 2012) by\nincluding a new mechanism, called separation-flux, that leads to strong\nphase-separation in avalanche and debris flows while balancing the enhanced\nsolid flux with the reduced fluid flux. The separation flux mechanism is\ncapable of describing the dynamically evolving phase-separation and levee\nformation in a multi-phase, geometrically three-dimensional debris flow. These\nare often observed phenomena in natural debris flows and industrial processes\nthat involve the transportation of particulate solid-fluid mixture material.\nThe novel separation-flux model includes several dominant physical and\nmechanical aspects such as pressure gradients, volume fractions of solid and\nfluid phases and their gradients, shear-rates, flow depth, material friction,\nviscosity, material densities, topographic constraints, grain size, etc. Due to\nthe inherent separation mechanism, as the mass moves down slope, more and more\nsolid particles are transported to the front and the sides, resulting in\nsolid-rich and mechanically strong frontal surge head, and lateral levees\nfollowed by a weaker tail largely consisting of viscous fluid. The primary\nfrontal solid-rich surge head followed by secondary fluid-rich surges is the\nconsequence of phase-separation. Such typical and dominant phase-separation\nphenomena are revealed for two-phase debris flow simulations. Finally, changes\nin flow composition, that are explicitly considered by the new modelling\napproach, result in significant changes of impact pressure estimates. These are\nhighly important in hazard assessment and mitigation planning and highlight the\napplication potential of the new approach.\n", "  The nuclear equation-of-state is a topic of highest current interest in\nnuclear structure and reactions as well as in astrophysics. In particular, the\nequation-of-state of asymmetric matter and the symmetry energy representing the\ndifference between the energy densities of neutron matter and of symmetric\nnuclear matter are not sufficiently well constrained at present. The density\ndependence of the symmetry energy is conventionally expressed in the form of\nthe slope parameter L describing the derivative with respect to density of the\nsymmetry energy at saturation. Results deduced from nuclear structure and\nheavy-ion reaction data are distributed around a mean value L=60 MeV.\n  Recent studies have more thoroughly investigated the density range that a\nparticular observable is predominantly sensitive to. Two thirds of the\nsaturation density is a value typical for the information contained in\nnuclear-structure data. Higher values exceeding saturation have been shown to\nbe probed with meson production and collective flows at incident energies in\nthe range of up to about 1 GeV/nucleon.\n  From the measurement of the elliptic-flow ratio of neutrons with respect to\nlight charged particles in recent experiments at the GSI laboratory, a new more\nstringent constraint for the symmetry energy at suprasaturation density has\nbeen deduced. It confirms, with a considerably smaller uncertainty, the\nmoderately soft to linear density dependence of the symmetry energy previously\ndeduced from the FOPI-LAND data. Future opportunities offered by FAIR will be\ndiscussed.\n", "  We study three-leg-ladder optical lattices loaded with repulsive atomic\nBose-Einstein condensates and subjected to artificial gauge fields. By\nemploying the plane-wave analysis and variational approach, we analyze the\nband-gap structure of the energy spectrum and reveal the exotic swallow-tail\nloop structures in the energy-level anti-crossing regions due to an interplay\nbetween the atom-atom interaction and artificial gauge field. Also, we discover\nstable discrete solitons residing in a semi-infinite gap above the highest\nband, these discrete solitons are associated with the chiral edge currents.\n", "  Polymer blends offer an exciting material for various potential applications\ndue to their tunable properties by varying constituting components and their\nrelative composition. Our simulation results unravel an intrinsic relationship\nbetween the phase behavior and crystallization characteristics with the\nrelative composition of A- and B-polymer in the system. We report simulation\nresults for non-isothermal and isothermal crystallization with weak and strong\nsegregation strength to elucidate the composition dependent crystallization\nbehavior. With increasing composition of low melting B-polymer, macrophase\nseparation and crystallization temperature changes non-monotonically, which is\nattributed to the change in diffusivity of both the polymers with increasing\ncomposition of B-polymer. In weak segregation strength, however, at high enough\ncomposition of B-polymer, A-polymer yields relatively thicker crystals, which\nis attributed to the dilution effect exhibited by B-polymer. When B-polymer\ncomposition is high enough, it acts like a solvent while A-polymer\ncrystallizes. Under this situation, A-polymer segments become more mobile and\nless facile to crystallize. As a result, A-polymer crystallizes at a relative\nlow temperature with the formation of thicker crystals. At strong segregation\nstrength, dilution effect is accompanied with the strong A-B repulsive\ninteraction, which is reflected in non-monotonic trend of mean square radius of\ngyration with increasing composition of B-polymer. Isothermal crystallization\nreveals a strong relationship between composition and crystallization behavior.\nTwo-step (viz., sequential crystallization) yields better crystals than\none-step (viz., coincident crystallization) for both the polymers.\n", "  We discuss the fidelity as a figure of merit in quantum error correction\nschemes. We show that when identifiable but uncorrectable errors occur as a\nresult of the action of the channel, a common strategy that improves the\nfidelity actually decreases the transmitted mutual information. The conclusion\nis that while the fidelity is simple to calculate and therefore often used, it\nis perhaps not always a recommendable figure of merit for quantum error\ncorrection. The reason is that while it roughly speaking encourages\noptimisation of the \"mean probability of success\", it gives no incentive for a\nprotocol to indicate exactly where the errors lurk. For small error\nprobabilities, the latter information is more important for the integrity of\nthe information than optimising the mean probability of success.\n", "  Fluctuations of Hamiltonian eigenfunctions, measured by the inverse\nparticipation ratio (IPR), turn out to characterize topological-band insulator\ntransitions occurring in 2D Dirac materials like silicene, which is\nisostructural with graphene but with a strong spin-orbit interaction. Using\nmonotonic properties of the IPR, as a function of a perpendicular electric\nfield (which provides a tunable band gap), we define topological-like quantum\nnumbers that take different values in the topological-insulator and\nband-insulator phases.\n", "  We review the results of our studies on the production of two jets with a\nlarge interval of rapidity at hadron colliders, which was proposed by Mueller\nand Navelet as a possible test of the high energy dynamics of QCD, within the\nnext-to-leading logarithm framework. The application of the\nBrodsky-Lepage-Mackenzie procedure to fix the renormalization scale leads to a\nvery good description of the available CMS data at the LHC for the azimuthal\ncorrelations of the jets. We show that the inclusion of next-to-leading order\ncorrections to the jet vertex significantly reduces the importance of\nenergy-momentum non-conservation which is inherent to the BFKL approach, for an\nasymmetric jet configuration.\n", "  We propose a method to identify the order of a Quantum Phase Transition by\nusing area measures of the ground state in phase space. We illustrate our\nproposal by analyzing the well known example of the Quantum Cusp, and four\ndifferent paradigmatic boson models: Dicke, Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick, interacting\nboson model, and vibron model.\n", "  In 1945 Einstein concluded that [1]: 'The present theory of relativity is\nbased on a division of physical reality into a metric field (gravitation) on\nthe one hand, and into an electromagnetic field and matter on the other hand.\nIn reality space will probably be of a uniform character and the present theory\nbe valid only as a limiting case. For large densities of field and of matter,\nthe field equations and even the field variables which enter into them will\nhave no real significance.'. The dichotomy can be resolved by introducing a\nscalar field/potential algebraically related to the Ricci tensor for which the\ncorresponding metric is free of additional singularities. Hence, although a\nfundamentally nonlinear theory, the scalar field/potential provides an analytic\nframework for interacting particles; described by linear superposition. The\nstress tensor for the scalar field includes both the sources of and the\nenergy-momentum for the gravitational field, and has zero covariant and\nordinary divergence. Hence, the energy-momentum for the gravitational field and\nsources are conserved. The theory's predictions agree with the experimental\nresults for General Relativity. By introducing the corresponding Lagrangian to\nanalytic mechanics, what is experimentally known for GR can be accounted for.\n", "  The Proca potential has been used in many contexts in flat spacetime, but not\nso often in curved spacetime. Here, the static Proca potentials are derived on\na Schwarzschild background, and are found to have very different forms from\nthose in flat space. In addition, the coupling of the two fields leads to a\nquantum condition on the particle mass, which is found to be quantized and\ninversely proportional to the range parameter, $\\mu$. This suggests that\ngravity may induce quantization in other physical fields.\n", "  We introduce an informative labeling algorithm for the vertices of a family\nof Koch networks. Each of the labels is consisted of two parts, the precise\nposition and the time adding to Koch networks. The shortest path routing\nbetween any two vertices is determined only on the basis of their labels, and\nthe routing is calculated only by few computations. The rigorous solutions of\nbetweenness centrality for every node and edge are also derived by the help of\ntheir labels. Furthermore, the community structure in Koch networks is studied\nby the current and voltage characteristics of its resistor networks.\n", "  Quantum physics emerge and develop as temperature is reduced. Although\nmesoscopic electrical circuits constitute an outstanding platform to explore\nquantum behavior, the challenge in cooling the electrons impedes their\npotential. The strong coupling of such micrometer-scale devices with the\nmeasurement lines, combined with the weak coupling to the substrate, makes them\nextremely difficult to thermalize below 10 mK and imposes in-situ thermometers.\nHere we demonstrate electronic quantum transport at 6 mK in micrometer-scale\nmesoscopic circuits. The thermometry methods are established by the comparison\nof three in-situ primary thermometers, each involving a different underlying\nphysics. The employed combination of quantum shot noise, quantum back-action of\na resistive circuit and conductance oscillations of a single-electron\ntransistor covers a remarkably broad spectrum of mesoscopic phenomena. The\nexperiment, performed in vacuum using a standard cryogen-free dilution\nrefrigerator, paves the way toward the sub-millikelvin range with additional\nthermalization and refrigeration techniques.\n", "  Using first-principles calculations combined with Boltzmann transport theory,\nwe investigate the effects of topological edge states on the thermoelectric\nproperties of Bi nanoribbons. It is found that there is a competition between\nthe edge and bulk contributions to the Seebeck coefficients. However, the\nelectronic transport of the system is dominated by the edge states because of\nits much larger electrical conductivity. As a consequence, a room temperature\nvalue exceeding 3.0 could be achieved for both p- and n-type systems when the\nrelaxation time ratio between the edge and the bulk states is tuned to be 1000.\nOur theoretical study suggests that the utilization of topological edge states\nmight be a promising approach to cross the threshold of the industrial\napplication of thermoelectricity.\n", "  Given a network represented by a graph $G=(V,E)$, we consider a dynamical\nprocess of influence diffusion in $G$ that evolves as follows: Initially only\nthe nodes of a given $S\\subseteq V$ are influenced; subsequently, at each\nround, the set of influenced nodes is augmented by all the nodes in the network\nthat have a sufficiently large number of already influenced neighbors. The\nquestion is to determine a small subset of nodes $S$ (\\emph{a target set}) that\ncan influence the whole network. This is a widely studied problem that\nabstracts many phenomena in the social, economic, biological, and physical\nsciences. It is known that the above optimization problem is hard to\napproximate within a factor of $2^{\\log^{1-\\epsilon}|V|}$, for any $\\epsilon\n>0$. In this paper, we present a fast and surprisingly simple algorithm that\nexhibits the following features: 1) when applied to trees, cycles, or complete\ngraphs, it always produces an optimal solution (i.e, a minimum size target\nset); 2) when applied to arbitrary networks, it always produces a solution of\ncardinality which improves on the previously known upper bound; 3) when applied\nto real-life networks, it always produces solutions that substantially\noutperform the ones obtained by previously published algorithms (for which no\nproof of optimality or performance guarantee is known in any class of graphs).\n", "  The wave propagation in the partially ionized ionosphere plays an important\nrole in the magnetosphere ionosphere coupling. For example, the ionosphere may\nsupports very low-frequency Alfven wave which can be caused by a balance\nbetween the bulk fluid inertia (mostly due to neutrals in the lower and middle\nE region) and the deformation of the magnetic field. The plasma neutral\ncollisional momentum exchange facilitates the transfer of the magnetic stress\n(felt directly by the ions) to the neutrals. Therefore, in the low-frequency\n(with respect to the neutral ion collision frequency) limit, waves through the\nionosphere can propagate with very little damping. In the vanishing plasma\ninertia limit, waves can be excited due to the loading of neutral inertia on\nthe field lines and thus may have very long wavelength and can easily couple to\nthe magnetosphere. The frequency of these waves are below few Hz.\n", "  Zeeman Doppler imaging has successfully mapped the large-scale magnetic\nfields of stars over a large range of spectral types, rotation periods and\nages. When observed over multiple epochs, some stars show polarity reversals in\ntheir global magnetic fields. On the Sun, polarity reversals are a feature of\nits activity cycle. In this paper, we examine the magnetic properties of stars\nwith existing chromospherically determined cycle periods. Previous authors have\nsuggested that cycle periods lie on multiple branches, either in the cycle\nperiod-Rossby number plane or the cycle period-rotation period plane. We find\nsome evidence that stars along the active branch show significant average\ntoroidal fields that exhibit large temporal variations while stars exclusively\non the inactive branch remain dominantly poloidal throughout their entire\ncycle. This lends credence to the idea that different shear layers are in\noperation along each branch. There is also evidence that the short magnetic\npolarity switches observed on some stars are characteristic of the inactive\nbranch while the longer chromospherically determined periods are characteristic\nof the active branch. This may explain the discrepancy between the magnetic and\nchromospheric cycle periods found on some stars. These results represent a\nfirst attempt at linking global magnetic field properties obtained form ZDI and\nactivity cycles.\n", "  We present preliminary results of an experimental study exploring helium at\nphotospheric conditions of white dwarf stars. These data were collected at\nSandia National Laboratories' Z-machine, the largest x-ray source on earth. Our\nhelium results could have many applications ranging from validating current DB\nwhite dwarf model atmospheres to providing accurate He pressure shifts at\nvarying temperatures and densities. In a much broader context, these helium\ndata can be used to guide theoretical developments in new continuum-lowering\nmodels for two-electron atoms. We also discuss future applications of our\nupdated experimental design, which enables us to sample a greater range of\ndensities, temperatures, and gas compositions.\n", "  We present a calculation of the effective geometry-induced quantum potential\nfor the carriers in graphene shaped as a helicoidal nanoribbon. In this\ngeometry the twist of the nanoribbon plays the role of an effective transverse\nelectric field in graphene and this is reminiscent of the Hall effect. However,\nthis effective electric field has a different sign for the two iso-spin states\nand translates into a mechanism to separate the two chiral species on the\nopposing rims of the nanoribbon. Iso-spin transitions are expected with the\nemission or absorption of microwave radiation which could be adjusted to be in\nthe THz region.\n", "  We develop physically admissible lattice models in the harmonic approximation\nwhich define by Hamilton's variational principle fractional Laplacian matrices\nof the forms of power law matrix functions on the n -dimensional periodic and\ninfinite lattice in n=1,2,3,..n=1,2,3,.. dimensions. The present model which is\nbased on Hamilton's variational principle is confined to conservative\nnon-dissipative isolated systems. The present approach yields the discrete\nanalogue of the continuous space fractional Laplacian kernel. As continuous\nfractional calculus generalizes differential operators such as the Laplacian to\nnon-integer powers of Laplacian operators, the fractional lattice approach\ndeveloped in this paper generalized difference operators such as second\ndifference operators to their fractional (non-integer) powers. Whereas\ndifferential operators and difference operators constitute local operations,\ntheir fractional generalizations introduce nonlocal long-range features. This\nis true for discrete and continuous fractional operators. The nonlocality\nproperty of the lattice fractional Laplacian matrix allows to describe numerous\nanomalous transport phenomena such as anomalous fractional diffusion and random\nwalks on lattices. We deduce explicit results for the fractional Laplacian\nmatrix in 1D for finite periodic and infinite linear chains and their Riesz\nfractional derivative continuum limit kernels.\n", "  We report the experimental realization of acoustic coherent perfect\nabsorption (CPA) of four symmetric scatterers of very different structures. The\nonly conditions necessary for these scatterers to exhibit CPA are that both the\nreflection and transmission amplitudes of the scatterers are 0.5 under one\nincident wave, and there are two collinear and counter-propagating incident\nwaves with appropriate relative amplitude and phase. Nearly 1000 times in the\nmodulation of output power has been demonstrated by changing the relative phase\nof the incident waves over 180{\\deg}. We further demonstrate that these\nscatterers are sensitive devices to detect the small differences between two\nnearly equal incident waves. A 27 % change in the strength of the scattering\nwave has been demonstrated for every degree of phase deviation from the optimum\ncondition between the incident waves.\n", "  In this paper we look for traces of interaction of CME/ICME with high-speed\nstream (HSS) of solar wind from coronal hole (CH) for two serial Carrington\nrotations (CRs) during December 2011 - January 2012. We analyze two cases. (1)\nIn CR 2118 instead of predicted arrival of HSS the signatures of ICME with\nmodified back side and compressed slow stream were observed. (2) In CR 2119 the\npredicted HSS was observed in time, and after arrival of preceding ICME. Our\nanalysis shows that difference of these cases can be explained by different\ninteractions between HSS and CME, which in the first case result in significant\ndeflection of HSS of solar wind from the Sun-Earth line. Thus, the CH passage\nthrough the central meridian with simultaneous occurrence of CMEs in the nearby\nlocated sources can result in interaction between HSS and CME streams,\ndeflection of the HSS stream aside of the ecliptic and changes in parameters of\nthe solar wind.\n", "  We speculate that the early Universe was inside a primordial black hole. The\ninterior of the the black hole is a dS background and the two spacetimes are\nseparated on the surface of black hole's event horizon. We argue that this\npicture provides a natural realization of inflation without invoking the\ninflaton field. The black hole evaporation by Hawking radiation provides a\nnatural mechanism for terminating inflation so reheating and the hot big bang\ncosmology starts from the evaporation of black hole to relativistic particles.\nThe quantum gravitational fluctuations at the boundary of black hole generate\nthe nearly scale invariant scalar and tensor perturbations with the ratio of\ntensor to scalar power spectra at the order of $10^{-3}$. As the black hole\nevaporates, the radius of its event horizon shrinks and the Hubble expansion\nrate during inflation increases slowly so the quantum Hawking radiation\nprovides a novel mechanism for the violation of null energy condition in\ncosmology.\n", "  Two approaches (micro- and macro- investigations) are used to determine the\ndimension dependences of the optical parameters of the nanometer-scale layers\nof materials. It is shown that both an index of refraction and coefficient of\nabsorption depend strongly on the thickness of the layer. In this region of\nthicknesses, the dimension resonance occurs, where an index of refraction has a\nmaximum and a coefficient of absorption has a minimum. The numerical\ncalculation of the optical parameters of some materials (Ag, Al, Fe, Ge, Si,\nSe, Te) have been carried out with the use of the experimental data of\nreflection and transparency of thin layers, obtained in a series of works, and\nwith our formulas for the wave amplitudes and the laws of refractions. The\nanalogues of the Fresnel formulas and the Snell law have been derived from the\nMaxwell boundary conditions where the absorption and conductivity of media were\ntaken into account. The use of our formulas for the wave amplitudes leads to\nthe fulfillment of the conservation law of energy both for the TE- and TM-\npolarizations of light. The reemission of light is possible for the\nthicknesses, which is equal to the wavelength of light in a medium, divisible\nby integer:\n$\\frac{2{\\pi}d_{res}}{2}={\\lambda}_m{\\cdot}m=\\frac{{\\lambda}_0}{n}{\\cdot}m$,\nwhere m=1,2,3... The visible luminescence of the porous silicon, silicon\nwhiskers and other nanometer-scale structures can be explained by their\nemission in the case of dimension resonance because in this region of\nthicknesses, layers have a big negative coefficient of absorption and little -\nof a damping. It is also shown that in the case of the TM-polarization, in a\nmaterial with a high conductivity, light refracts in a \"wrong\" direction (at\nall positive optical parameters) due to a surface current. In the case of the\nTE-polarization, light refracts only in a \"right\" direction.\n", "  Suprathermal tails are a common feature of solar wind electron velocity\ndistributions, and are expected in the solar corona. From the corona,\nsuprathermal electrons can propagate through the steep temperature gradient of\nthe transition region towards the chromosphere, and lead to non-Maxwellian\nelectron velocity distribution functions (VDFs) with pronounced suprathermal\ntails. We calculate the evolution of a coronal electron distribution through\nthe transition region in order to quantify the suprathermal electron population\nthere. A kinetic model for electrons is used which is based on solving the\nBoltzmann-Vlasov equation for electrons including Coulomb collisions with both\nions and electrons. Initial and chromospheric boundary conditions are\nMaxwellian VDFs with densities and temperatures based on a background fluid\nmodel. The coronal boundary condition has been adopted from earlier studies of\nsuprathermal electron formation in coronal loops. The model results show the\npresence of strong suprathermal tails in transition region electron VDFs,\nstarting at energies of a few 10 eV. Above electron energies of 600 eV,\nelectrons can traverse the transition region essentially collision-free. The\npresence of strong suprathermal tails in transition region electron VDFs shows\nthat the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium is not justified there.\nThis has a significant impact on ionization dynamics, as is shown in a\ncompanion paper.\n", "  Carl Bender and collaborators have developed a quantum theory governed by\nHamiltonians that are PT-symmetric rather than Hermitian. To implement this\ntheory, the inner product was redefined to guarantee positive norms of\neigenstates of the Hamiltonian. In the general case, which includes arbitrary\ntime-dependence in the Hamiltonian, a modification of the Schrodinger equation\nis necessary as shown by Gong and Wang to conserve probability. In this paper,\nwe derive the following selection rule: transitions induced by time dependence\nin a PT-symmetric Hamiltonian cannot occur between normalized states of\ndiffering PT-norm. We show three examples of this selection rule in action: two\nmatrix models and one in the continuum.\n", "  In this work we use molecular simulations to examine methods of controlling\nmechanical properties of polymeric glass materials such as elastic moduli,\nmechanical heterogeneity as well as their glass transition temperature. We\nstudy filled and unfilled polymers and examine the effect of particle size,\nvolume fraction and polymer-particle interactions. We identify a relationship\nbetween mobility and dynamic heterogeneity with elastic moduli and glass\ntransition temperature.\n", "  This article gives a rigorous formulation and proof of the $1/N$ expansion\nfor Wilson loop expectations in strongly coupled $SU(N)$ lattice gauge theory\nin any dimension. The coefficients of the expansion are represented as\nabsolutely convergent sums over trajectories in a string theory on the lattice,\nestablishing a kind of gauge-string duality. Moreover, it is shown that in\nlarge $N$ limit, calculations in $SU(N)$ lattice gauge theory with coupling\nstrength $2\\beta$ corresponds to those in $SO(N)$ lattice gauge theory with\ncoupling strength $\\beta$ when $|\\beta|$ is sufficiently small.\n", "  The measurement of $BR(K^+\\to\\pi^+\\nu\\bar{\\nu})$ with 10% precision by the\nNA62 experiment requires extreme background suppression. The Small Angle\nCalorimeter aims to provide an efficient veto for photons flying at angles down\nto zero with respect to the kaon flight direction. The initial prototype was\nupgraded and tested at the Beam Test Facility of the DA$\\Phi$NE Linac at\nFrascati. The energy resolution and the efficiency were measured and are\npresented.\n", "  Recently S. Meljanac proposed a construction of a class of examples of an\nalgebraic structure with properties very close to the Hopf algebroids $H$ over\na noncommutative base $A$ of other authors. His examples come along with a\nsubalgebra $\\mathcal{B}$ of $H\\otimes H$, here called the balancing subalgebra,\nwhich contains the image of the coproduct and such that the intersection of\n$\\mathcal{B}$ with the kernel of the projection $H\\otimes H\\to H\\otimes_A H$ is\na two-sided ideal in $\\mathcal{B}$ which is moreover well behaved with respect\nto the antipode. We propose a set of abstract axioms covering this construction\nand make a detailed comparison to the Hopf algebroids of Lu. We prove that\nevery scalar extension Hopf algebroid can be cast into this new set of axioms.\n"]}
