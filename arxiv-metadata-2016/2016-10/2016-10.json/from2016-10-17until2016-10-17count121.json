In this\narticle, we study some implications of this fact in the case of topological\ntensor networks. The graph underlying these networks is given by the\ntriangulation of a manifold, and the structure of the tensors ensures that the\noverall tensor is independent of the choice of internal triangulation. This\nleads to quantum algorithms for additively approximating certain invariants of\ntriangulated manifolds. We discuss the details of this construction in two\nspecific cases. In the first case, we consider triangulated surfaces, where the\ntriangle tensor is defined by the multiplication operator of a finite group;\nthe resulting invariant has a simple closed-form expression involving the\ndimensions of the irreducible representations of the group and the Euler\ncharacteristic of the surface. In the second case, we consider triangulated\n3-manifolds, where the tetrahedral tensor is defined by the so-called Fibonacci\nanyon model; the resulting invariant is the well-known Turaev-Viro invariant of\n3-manifolds.\n", "  It is well-known that deciding equivalence of logic circuits is a\ncoNP-complete problem. As a corollary, the problem of deciding weak equivalence\nof reversible circuits, i.e. ignoring the ancilla bits, is also coNP-complete.\nThe complexity of deciding strong equivalence, including the ancilla bits, is\nless obvious and may depend on gate set. Here we use Barrington's theorem to\nshow that deciding strong equivalence of reversible circuits built from the\nFredkin gate is coNP-complete. This implies coNP-completeness of deciding\nstrong equivalence for other commonly used universal reversible gate sets,\nincluding any gate set that includes the Toffoli or Fredkin gate.\n", "  We present a quantum logic scheme to detect atomic and molecular ions in\ndifferent states of angular momentum based on their magnetic $g$-factors. The\nstate-dependent magnetic $g$-factors mean that electronic, rotational or\nhyperfine states may be distinguished by their Zeeman splittings in a given\nmagnetic field. Driving motional sidebands of a chosen Zeeman splitting enables\nreading out the corresponding state of angular momentum with an auxillary logic\nion. As a proof-of-principle demonstration, we show that we can detect the\nground electronic state of a ${^{174}}$Yb$^+$ ion using ${^{171}}$Yb$^+$ as the\nlogic ion. Further, we can distinguish between the ${^{174}}$Yb$^+$ ion being\nin its ground electronic state versus the metastable ${^{2}}D_{3/2}$ state. We\ndiscuss the suitability of this scheme for the detection of rotational states\nin molecular ions.\n", "  Motivated by a probabilistic approach to Kahler-Einstein metrics we consider\na general non-equilibrium statistical mechanics model in Euclidean space\nconsisting of the stochastic gradient flow of a given (possibly singular)\nquasi-convex N-particle interaction energy. We show that a deterministic\n\"macroscopic\" evolution equation emerges in the large N-limit of many\nparticles. This is a strengthening of previous results which required a uniform\ntwo-sided bound on the Hessian of the interaction energy. The proof uses the\ntheory of weak gradient flows on the Wasserstein space. Applied to the setting\nof permanental point processes at \"negative temperature\" the corresponding\nlimiting evolution equation yields a drift-diffusion equation, coupled to the\nMonge-Ampere operator, whose static solutions correspond to toric\nKahler-Einstein metrics. This drift-diffusion equation is the gradient flow on\nthe Wasserstein space of probability measures of the K-energy functional in\nKahler geometry and it can be seen as a fully non-linear version of various\nextensively studied dissipative evolution equations and conservations laws,\nincluding the Keller-Segel equation and Burger's equation. We also obtain a\nreal probabilistic (and tropical) analog of the complex geometric\nYau-Tian-Donaldson conjecture in this setting. In a companion paper\napplications to singular pair interactions are given.\n", "  We consider quasi-stationary scattering of interacting bosonic matter waves\nin one-dimensional waveguides, as they arise in guided atom lasers. We show how\nthe truncated Wigner (tW) method, which corresponds to the semiclassical\ndescription of the bosonic many-body system on the level of the diagonal\napproximation, can be utilized in order to describe such many-body bosonic\nscattering processes. Special emphasis is put on the discretization of space at\nthe exact quantum level, in order to properly implement the semiclassical\napproximation and the tW method, as well as on the discussion of the results to\nbe obtained in the continuous limit.\n", "  The paper aims to adopt the complex quaternion and octonion to formulate the\nfield equations for electromagnetic and gravitational fields. Applying the\noctonionic representation enables one single definition to combine some physics\ncontents of two fields, which were considered to be independent of each other\nin the past. J. C. Maxwell applied simultaneously the vector terminology and\nthe quaternion analysis to depict the electromagnetic theory. This method\nedified the paper to introduce the quaternion and octonion spaces into the\nfield theory, in order to describe the physical feature of electromagnetic and\ngravitational fields, while their coordinates are able to be the complex\nnumber. The octonion space can be separated into two subspaces, the quaternion\nspace and the S-quaternion space. In the quaternion space, it is able to infer\nthe field potential, field strength, field source, field equations, and so\nforth, in the gravitational field. In the S-quaternion space, it is able to\ndeduce the field potential, field strength, field source, and so forth, in the\nelectromagnetic field. The results reveal that the quaternion space is\nappropriate to describe the gravitational features; meanwhile the S-quaternion\nspace is proper to depict the electromagnetic features.\n", "  The power from wind and solar exhibits a nonlinear flickering variability,\nwhich typically occurs at time scales of a few seconds. We show that\nhigh-frequency monitoring of such renewable powers enables us to detect a\ntransition, controlled by the field size, where the output power qualitatively\nchanges its behaviour from a flickering type to a diffusive stochastic\nbehaviour. We find that the intermittency and strong non-Gaussian behavior in\ncumulative power of the total field, even for a country-wide installation still\nsurvives for both renewable sources. To overcome the short time intermittency,\nwe introduce a time-delayed feedback method for power output of wind farm and\nsolar field that can change further the underlying stochastic process and\nsuppress their strong non- gaussian fluctuations.\n", "  We show that, for any n, there are m-outcome quantum correlations, with m>n,\nwhich are stronger than any nonsignaling correlation produced from selecting\namong n-outcome measurements. As a consequence, for any n, there are m-outcome\nquantum measurements that cannot be constructed by selecting locally from the\nset of n-outcome measurements. This is a property of the set of measurements in\nquantum theory that is not mandatory for general probabilistic theories. We\nalso show that this prediction can be tested through high-precision Bell-type\nexperiments and identify past experiments providing evidence that some of these\nstrong correlations exist in nature. Finally, we provide a modified version of\nquantum theory restricted to having at most n-outcome quantum measurements.\n", "  We assess the accuracy of vibrational damping rates of diatomic adsorbates on\nmetal surfaces as calculated within the local-density friction approximation\n(LDFA). An atoms-in-molecules (AIM) type charge partitioning scheme accounts\nfor intra-molecular contributions and overcomes the systematic underestimation\nof the non-adiabatic losses obtained within the prevalent independent atom\napproximation. The quantitative agreement obtained with theoretical and\nexperimental benchmark data suggests the LDFA-AIM as an efficient and reliable\napproach to account for electronic dissipation in ab initio molecular dynamics\nsimulations of surface chemical reactions.\n", "  This article sets up a formalism to describe stochastic thermodynamics for\ndriven out-of-equilibrium open quantum systems. A stochastic Schr\\\"odinger\nequation allows to construct quantum trajectories describing the dynamics of\nthe system state vector in presence of an eventually monitored environment.\nThermodynamic quantities are defined at the single quantum trajectory level,\nindependently of any energy measurement, at any time of the protocol. We\nthereby identify coherent contributions, without classical counterparts,\nleading to quantum fluctuations of thermodynamic quantities. This formalism\neventually leads to central fluctuation theorems for entropy, extending in the\nquantum regime results obtained in classical stochastic thermodynamics. The\nthermal imprint of coherences on a simple implementation of Jarzynski equality\nis investigated, opening avenues for a thermodynamic approach to decoherence.\n", "  We show that the new precise measurements of Cosmic Microwave Background\n(CMB) temperature and polarization anisotropies made by the Planck satellite\nsignificantly improves previous constraints on the cosmic gravitational waves\nbackground (CGWB) at frequencies $f>10^{-15}$ Hz. On scales smaller than the\nhorizon at the time of decoupling, primordial gravitational waves contribute to\nthe total radiation content of the Universe. Considering adiabatic\nperturbations, CGWB affects temperature and polarization CMB power spectra and\nmatter power spectrum in a manner identical to relativistic particles.\nConsidering the latest Planck results we constrain the CGWB energy density to\n$\\Omega_{\\rm gw} h^2 <1.7\\times 10^{-6} $ at 95\\% CL. Combining CMB power\nspectra with lensing, BAO and primordial Deuterium abundance observations, we\nobtain $\\Omega_{\\rm gw} h^2 <1.2\\times 10^{-6} $ at 95\\% CL, improving previous\nPlanck bounds by a factor 3 and the recent direct upper limit from the LIGO and\nVIRGO experiments a factor 2. A combined analysis of future satellite missions\nas COrE and EUCLID could improve current bound by more than an order of\nmagnitude.\n", "  In this work we calculate the mass spectrum, weak decay constants, two photon\ndecay widths, and two gluon decay widths of ground (1S), and radially excited\n(2S,3S,...) states of pseudoscalar charmoniuum and bottomonium such as\n$\\eta_{c}$ and $\\eta_{b}$, as well as the mass spectrum and leptonic decay\nconstants of ground state (1S), excited (2S,1D,3S,2D,4S,and 3D) states of\nvector charmonium and bottomonium such as $J/\\psi$, and $\\Upsilon$, using the\nformulation of Bethe-Salpeter equation under covariant Instantaneous Ansatz\n(CIA). Our results are in good agreement with data (where ever available) and\nother models. In this framework, from the beginning, we employ a $4\\times 4$\nrepresentation for two-body ($q\\overline{q}$) BS amplitude for calculating both\nthe mass spectra as well as the transition amplitudes. However, the price we\nhave to pay is to solve a coupled set of equations for both pseudoscalar and\nvector quarkonia, which we have explicitly shown get decoupled in the\nheavy-quark approximation, leading to mass spectral equation with analytical\nsolutions for both masses, as well as eigenfunctions for all the above states,\nin an approximate harmonic oscillator basis. Further, in the present framework\nof BSE, the hadron-quark vertex function (and the full 4D BS wave function) for\npseudoscalar and vector quarkonia used for calculation of various processes,\naccommodates all the Dirac structures from their complete set in a natural\nmanner.\n", "  We propose a free-space reconfigurable quantum key distribution (QKD) network\nto secure communication among mobile users. Depends on the trustworthiness of\nthe network relay, the users can implement either the highly secure\nmeasurement-device-independent QKD, or the highly efficient decoy state BB84\nQKD. Based on the same quantum infrastructure, we also propose a loss tolerant\nquantum position verification scheme, which could allow the QKD users to\ninitiate the QKD process without relying on pre-shared key.\n", "  In order to achieve a better analytic handle on the modern conformal\nbootstrap program, we re-examine and extend the pioneering 1974 work of\nPolyakov's, which was based on consistency between the operator product\nexpansion and unitarity. As in the bootstrap approach, this method does not\ndepend on evaluating Feynman diagrams. We show how this approach can be used to\ncompute the anomalous dimensions of certain operators in the $O(n)$ model at\nthe Wilson-Fisher fixed point in $4-\\epsilon$ dimensions up to $O(\\epsilon^2)$.\n", "  Corda, Mosquera Cuesta and Lorduy Gomez have shown that spherically symmetric\nstationary states can be used as a model for galaxies in the framework of the\nlinearized R^2 gravity. Those states could represent a partial solution to the\nDark Matter Problem. Here we discuss an improvement of this work. In fact, as\nthe star density is a functional of the invariants of the associated Vlasov\nequation, we show that any of these invariants is in its turn a functional of\nthe local energy and the angular momentum. As a consequence, the star density\ndepends only on these two integrals of the Vlasov system. This result is known\nas the \"Jeans theorem\". In addition, we find an analogous of the historical\nTolman- Oppenheimer-Volkov equation for the system considered in this paper.\nFor the sake of completeness, in the final Section of the paper we consider two\nadditional models which argue that Dark Matter could not be an essential\nelement.\n", "  The ability to live in coherent superpositions is a signature trait of\nquantum systems and constitutes an irreplaceable resource for quantum-enhanced\ntechnologies. However, decoherence effects usually destroy quantum\nsuperpositions. It has been recently predicted that, in a composite quantum\nsystem exposed to dephasing noise, quantum coherence in a transversal reference\nbasis can stay protected for indefinite time. This can occur for a class of\nquantum states independently of the measure used to quantify coherence, and\nrequires no control on the system during the dynamics. Here, such an invariant\ncoherence phenomenon is observed experimentally in two different setups based\non nuclear magnetic resonance at room temperature, realising an effective\nquantum simulator of two- and four-qubit spin systems. Our study further\nreveals a novel interplay between coherence and various forms of correlations,\nand highlights the natural resilience of quantum effects in complex systems.\n", "  We calculate a measure of superposition macroscopicity $\\mathcal{M}$ for a\nsuperposition of screening current states in a superconducting flux qubit\n(SFQ), by relating $\\mathcal{M}$ to the action of an instanton trajectory\nconnecting the potential wells of the flux qubit. When a magnetized\nBose-Einstein condensed (BEC) gas containing $N_{B}\\sim \\mathcal{O}(10^6)$\natoms is brought into a $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ $\\mu\\text{m}$ proximity of the flux\nqubit in an experimentally realistic geometry, we demonstrate the appearance of\na two- to five-fold amplification of $\\mathcal{M}$ over the bare value without\nthe BEC, by calculating the instantion trajectory action from the\nmicroscopically derived effective flux Lagrangian of a hybrid quantum system\ncomposed of the flux qubit and a spin-$F$ atomic Bose gas. Exploiting the\nconnection between $\\mathcal M$ and the maximal metrological usefulness of a\nmultimode superposition state, we show that amplification of $\\mathcal{M}$ in\nthe ground state of the hybrid system is equivalent to a decrease in the\nquantum Cram\\'{e}r-Rao bound for estimation of an externally applied flux. Our\nresult therefore demonstrates the increased usefulness of the BEC--SFQ hybrid\nsystem as a sensor of ultraweak magnetic fields below the standard quantum\nlimit.\n", "  Traditional cosmological inference using Type Ia supernovae (SNeIa) have used\nstretch- and color-corrected fits of SN Ia light curves and assumed a resulting\nfiducial mean and symmetric intrinsic dispersion for the resulting relative\nluminosity. As systematics become the main contributors to the error budget, it\nhas become imperative to expand supernova cosmology analyses to include a more\ngeneral likelihood to model systematics to remove biases with losses in\nprecision. To illustrate an example likelihood analysis, we use a simple model\nof two populations with a relative luminosity shift, independent intrinsic\ndispersions, and linear redshift evolution of the relative fraction of each\npopulation. Treating observationally viable two-population mock data using a\none-population model results in an inferred dark energy equation of state\nparameter $w$ that is biased by roughly 2 times its statistical error for a\nsample of N $ \\gtrsim$ 2500 SNeIa. Modeling the two-population data with a\ntwo-population model removes this bias at a cost of an approximately $\\sim20\\%$\nincrease in the statistical constraint on $w$. These significant biases can be\nrealized even if the support for two underlying SNeIa populations, in the form\nof model selection criteria, is inconclusive. With the current\nobservationally-estimated difference in the two proposed populations, a sample\nof N $ \\gtrsim$ 10,000 SNeIa is necessary to yield conclusive evidence of two\npopulations.\n", "  We present a new set of 95 numerical relativity simulations of non-precessing\nbinary black holes (BBHs). The simulations sample comprehensively both\nblack-hole spins up to spin magnitude of 0.9, and cover mass ratios 1 to 3. The\nsimulations cover on average 24 inspiral orbits, plus merger and ringdown, with\nlow initial orbital eccentricities $e<10^{-4}$. A subset of the simulations\nextends the coverage of non-spinning BBHs up to mass ratio $q=10$.\nGravitational waveforms at asymptotic infinity are computed with two\nindependent techniques, extrapolation, and Cauchy characteristic extraction. An\nerror analysis based on noise-weighted inner products is performed. We find\nthat numerical truncation error, error due to gravitational wave extraction,\nand errors due to the finite length of the numerical waveforms are of similar\nmagnitude, with gravitational wave extraction errors somewhat dominating at\nnoise-weighted mismatches of $\\sim 3\\times 10^{-4}$. This set of waveforms will\nserve to validate and improve aligned-spin waveform models for gravitational\nwave science.\n", "  In this work, we study the localization of the vector gauge field in two\nfive-dimensional braneworlds generated by scalar fields coupled to gravity. The\nsine-Gordon like potentials are employed to produce different thick brane\nsetups. A zero mode localized is obtained, and we show the existence of\nreverberations with the wave solutions indicating a quasi-localized massive\nmode. More interesting results are achieved when we propose a double\nsine-Gordon potential to the scalar field. The resulting thick brane shows a\nmore detailed topology with the presence of an internal structure composed by\ntwo kinks. The massive spectrum of the gauge field is revalued on this scenario\nrevealing the existence of various resonant modes. Furthermore, we compute the\ncorrections to Coulomb law coming from these massive KK vector modes in these\nthick scenarios, where is concluded that the dilaton parameter regulates these\ncorrections.\n", "  The full-phase infrared light curves of low-eccentricity hot Jupiters show a\ntrend of increasing dayside-to-nightside brightness temperature difference with\nincreasing equilibrium temperature. Here we present a three-dimensional model\nthat explains this relationship, in order to shed insight on the processes that\ncontrol heat redistribution in tidally-locked planetary atmospheres. This\nthree-dimensional model combines predictive analytic theory for the atmospheric\ncirculation and dayside-nightside temperature differences over a range of\nequilibrium temperature, atmospheric composition, and potential frictional drag\nstrengths with numerical solutions of the circulation that verify this analytic\ntheory. This analytic theory shows that the longitudinal propagation of waves\nmediates dayside-nightside temperature differences in hot Jupiter atmospheres,\nanalogous to the wave adjustment mechanism that regulates the thermal structure\nin Earth's tropics. These waves can be damped in hot Jupiter atmospheres by\neither radiative cooling or potential frictional drag. This frictional drag\nwould likely be caused by Lorentz forces in a partially ionized atmosphere\nthreaded by a background magnetic field, and would increase in strength with\nincreasing temperature. Additionally, the amplitude of radiative heating and\ncooling increases with increasing temperature, and hence both radiative\nheating/cooling and frictional drag damp waves more efficiently with increasing\nequilibrium temperature. Radiative heating and cooling play the largest role in\ncontrolling dayside-nightside temperature temperature differences in both our\nanalytic theory and numerical simulations, with frictional drag only important\nif it is stronger than the Coriolis force. As a result, dayside-nightside\ntemperature differences in hot Jupiter atmospheres increase with increasing\nstellar irradiation and decrease with increasing pressure.\n", "  Ellipse and hyperbola are two well-known curves in mathematics with numerous\napplications in various fields, but their properties and inherent differences\nin spin optics are less understood. Here, we investigate the peculiar optical\nspin properties of the two curves and establish a connection between their foci\nand the spin states of incident light. We show that the optical spin Hall\neffect is the intrinsic optical spin property of ellipse, where photons with\ndifferent spin states can be exactly separated to each of its two foci. While a\nhyperbola exhibits optical spin-selective effect, where only photons with one\nparticular spin state can be accumulated at its foci. These properties are then\nexperimentally demonstrated in near field by arranging nanoslits in conic\nshape. Based on the spin properties of the curves, we design spin-based\nplasmonic devices with various functionalities. Our results reveal the\nintrinsic optical spin properties behind conic curves and provide a route for\ndesigning spin-based plasmonic device.\n", "  We investigate the complex interactions between the stellar disc and the\ndark-matter halo during bar formation and evolution using N-body simulations\nwith fine temporal resolution and optimally chosen spatial resolution. We find\nthat the forming stellar bar traps dark matter in the vicinity of the stellar\nbar into bar-supporting orbits. We call this feature the shadow bar. The shadow\nbar modifies both the location and magnitude of the angular momentum transfer\nbetween the disc and dark matter halo and adds 10 per cent to the mass of the\nstellar bar over 4 Gyr. The shadow bar is potentially observable by its density\nand velocity signature in spheroid stars and by direct dark matter detection\nexperiments. Numerical tests demonstrate that the shadow bar can diminish the\nrate of angular momentum transport from the bar to the dark matter halo by more\nthan a factor of three over the rate predicted by dynamical friction with an\nuntrapped dark halo, and thus provides a possible physical explanation for the\nobserved prevalence of fast bars in nature.\n", "  We revisit the issue of interpreting the results of large volume cosmological\nsimulations in the context of large scale general relativistic effects. We look\nfor simple modifications to the nonlinear evolution of the gravitational\npotential $\\psi$ that lead on large scales to the correct, fully relativistic\ndescription of density perturbations in the Newtonian gauge. We note that the\nrelativistic constraint equation for $\\psi$ can be cast as a diffusion\nequation, with a diffusion length scale determined by the expansion of the\nUniverse. Exploiting the weak time evolution of $\\psi$ in all regimes of\ninterest, this equation can be further accurately approximated as a Helmholtz\nequation, with an effective relativistic 'screening' scale $\\ell$ related to\nthe Hubble radius. We demonstrate that it is thus possible to carry out N-body\nsimulations in the Newtonian gauge by replacing Poisson's equation with this\nHelmholtz equation, involving a trivial change in the Green's function kernel.\nOur results also motivate a simple, approximate (but very accurate) gauge\ntransformation - $\\delta_{\\rm N}(\\mathbf{k}) \\approx \\delta_{\\rm\nsim}(\\mathbf{k})\\times (k^2+\\ell^{-2})/k^2$ - to convert the density field\n$\\delta_{\\rm sim}$ of standard collisionless N-body simulations (initialised in\nthe comoving synchronous gauge) into the Newtonian gauge density $\\delta_{\\rm\nN}$ at arbitrary times. A similar conversion can also be written in terms of\nparticle positions. Our results can be interpreted in terms of a Jeans\nstability criterion induced by the expansion of the Universe. The appearance of\nthe screening scale $\\ell$ in the evolution of $\\psi$, in particular, leads to\na natural resolution of the 'Jeans swindle' in the presence of super-horizon\nmodes.\n", "  We present a detailed phenomenological study of Z-boson production in\nassociation with a jet through next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in\nperturbative QCD. Fiducial cross sections and differential distributions for\nboth 8 TeV and 13 TeV LHC collisions are presented. We study the impact of\ndifferent parton distribution functions (PDFs) on predictions for the Z+jet\nprocess. Upon inclusion of the NNLO corrections, the residual scale uncertainty\nis reduced such that both the total rate and the transverse momentum\ndistributions can be used to discriminate between various PDF sets.\n", "  The low energy physics of both graphene and surface states of\nthree-dimensional topological insulators is described by gapless Dirac fermions\nwith linear dispersion. In this work, we predict the emergence of a \"heavy\"\nDirac fermion in a graphene/topological insulator hetero-junction, where the\nlinear term almost vanishes and the corresponding energy dispersion becomes\nhighly non-linear. By combining {\\it ab initio} calculations and an effective\nlow-energy model, we show explicitly how strong hybridization between Dirac\nfermions in graphene and the surface states of topological insulators can\nreduce the Fermi velocity of Dirac fermions. Due to the negligible linear term,\ninteraction effects will be greatly enhanced and can drive \"heavy\" Dirac\nfermion states into the half quantum Hall state with non-zero Hall conductance.\n", "  We perform spectroscopic measurements of electromagnetically induced\ntransparency (EIT) in a strongly interacting Rydberg gas, and observe a\nsignificant spectral shift of the transparency from the single-atom EIT\nresonance as well as a spectral dephasing of the same order. We characterize\nthe shift and dephasing as a function of atomic density, probe Rabi frequency,\nand principal quantum number of Rydberg states, and demonstrate that the\nobserved spectral shift and dephasing are reduced if the size of a Gaussian\natomic cloud is increased. We simulate our experiment with a semi-analytical\nmodel, which gives results in good agreement with our experimental data.\n", "  In this paper we develop a cost-benefit analysis of a major research\ninfrastructure, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the highest-energy accelerator\nin the world, currently operating at CERN. We show that the evaluation of\nbenefits can be made quantitative by estimating their welfare effects on\ndifferent types of agents. Four classes of direct benefits are identified,\naccording to the main social groups involved: (a) scientists; (b) students and\nyoung researchers; (c) firms in the procurement chain and other organizations;\n(d) the general public, including onsite and website visitors and other media\nusers. These benefits are respectively related to the knowledge output of\nscientists; human capital formation; technological spillovers; and direct\ncultural effects for the general public. Welfare effects for taxpayers can also\nbe estimated by the contingent valuation of the willingness to pay for a pure\npublic good for which there is no specific direct use (i.e., as non-use value).\nUsing a Monte Carlo approach, we estimate the conditional probability\ndistribution of costs and benefits for the LHC from 1993 until its planned\ndecommissioning in 2025, assuming a range of values for some critical\nstochastic variables. We conservatively estimate that there is around a 90\\%\nprobability that benefits exceed costs, with an expected net present value of\nabout 2.9 billion euro, not considering the unpredictable applications of\nscientific discovery.\n", "  The production rate of the X(5568) observed by D0 collabotation is quite\nlarge and can not be understood by various general hadronization mechanism. We\npropose an inclusive resonance production formulation to calculate the cross\nsection and extract the value of the effective wave function at origin. Based\non these results we suspect X($D_s \\pi^{\\pm}$) can be copiously produced and\nobservable at high enenrgy scatterings (the relative production ratio to D_s is\nlarger than 10 %).\n  In the updated version the discussions on cluster model and FI are added.\nBoth cases can not give large rate.\n  Then we show that pion in X(5568) decay can only gain a very small momentum.\nIn the pseudo-rapidity region [2,5], large part of the signal pions will be\ndismissed by the detector since the transverse mometum is too small and/or\ntotal momentum too small. If further requirement on pion tranverse mometum\nlarger than 1GeV/c added, almost all signal pions are rejected. But for the\ncharm partner, this problem does not exist since the charm partner can give a\nlarger boost factor. A 3D distribution of signal pions are added\n", "  The spontaneous formation of patterns in dynamical systems is a rich\nphenomenon that transcends scientific boundaries. Here, we report our\nobservation of coupled optical-atomic pattern formation, which results in the\ncreation of self-organized, multimode structures in free-space laser-driven\ncold atoms. We show that this process gives rise to spontaneous\nthree-dimensional Sisyphus cooling even at very low light intensities and the\nemergence of self-organized atomic structures on both sub- and super-wavelength\nscales.\n", "  We present a cascading failure model of two interdependent networks in which\nfunctional nodes belong to components of size greater than or equal to $s$. We\nfind theoretically and via simulation that in complex networks with random\ndependency links the transition is first-order for $s\\geq 3$ and second-order\nfor $s=2$. We find for two square lattices with a distance constraint $r$ in\nthe dependency links that increasing $r$ moves the system from a regime without\na phase transition to one with a second-order transition. As $r$ continues to\nincrease the system collapses in a first-order transition. Each regime is\nassociated with a different structure of domain formation of functional nodes.\n", "  This article sets up a new formalism to investigate stochastic thermodynamics\nof out-of-equilibrium quantum systems, where stochasticity primarily comes from\nquantum measurement. In the absence of any bath, we define a purely quantum\ncomponent to heat exchange, that corresponds to energy fluctuations induced by\nmeasurement back-action. By providing a central position to quantum\nmeasurement, our formalism bridges the gap between quantum optics and quantum\nthermodynamics: Thermal signatures of measurement induced irreversibility are\nidentified in a simple implementation of Jarzynski equality, while quantum\nthermodynamics sheds new light on textbook paradoxical trajectories in quantum\noptics.\n", "  Mu3e is a novel experiment searching for charged lepton flavor violation in\nthe rare decay $\\mu^+ \\rightarrow e^+e^-e^+$. Decay vertex position, decay time\nand particle momenta have to be precisely measured in order to reject both\naccidental and physics background. A silicon pixel tracker based on $50\\,\\mu$m\nthin high voltage monolithic active pixel sensors (HV-MAPS) in a 1 T solenoidal\nmagnetic field provides precise vertex and momentum information. The MuPix chip\ncombines pixel sensor cells with integrated analog electronics and a periphery\nwith a complete digital readout. The MuPix7 is the first HV-MAPS prototype\nimplementing all functionalities of the final sensor including a readout state\nmachine and high speed serialization with 1.25 Gbit/s data output, allowing for\na streaming readout in parallel to the data taking. The observed efficiency of\nthe MuPix7 chip including the full readout system is $\\geq99\\%$ in a high rate\ntest beam.\n", "  The Nitrogen-Vacancy (NV) center in diamond has attractive properties for a\nnumber of quantum technologies that rely on the spin angular momentum of the\nelectron and the nuclei adjacent to the center. The nucleus with the strongest\ninteraction is the $^{13}$C nuclear spin of the first shell. Using this degree\nof freedom effectively hinges on precise data on the hyperfine interaction\nbetween the electronic and the nuclear spin. Here, we present detailed\nexperimental data on this interaction, together with an analysis that yields\nall parameters of the hyperfine tensor, as well as its orientation with respect\nto the atomic structure of the center.\n", "  We consider spherically symmetric space-times in GR under the unconventional\nassumptions that the spherical radius $r$ is either a constant or has a null\ngradient in the $(t,x)$ subspace orthogonal to the symmetry spheres (i.e.,\n$(\\partial r)^2 = 0$). It is shown that solutions to the Einstein equations\nwith $r = \\rm const$ contain an extra (fourth) spatial or temporal Killing\nvector and thus satisfy the Birkhoff theorem under an additional physically\nmotivated condition that the lateral pressure is functionally related to the\nenergy density. This leads to solutions that directly generalize the\nBertotti-Robinson, Nariai and Plebanski-Hacyan solutions. Under similar\nconditions, solutions with $(\\partial r)^2 = 0$ but $r\\ne\\rm const$, supported\nby an anisotropic fluid, contain a null Killing vector, which again indicates a\nBirkhoff-like behavior of the system. Similar space-times supported by pure\nradiation (in particular, a massless radiative scalar field) contain a null\nKilling vector without additional assumptions, which leads to one more\nextension of the Birkhoff theorem. Exact radial wave solutions have been found\n(i) with an anisotropic fluid and (ii) with a gas of radially directed cosmic\nstrings (or a \"string cloud\") combined with pure radiation. Furthermore, it is\nshown that a perfect fluid with isotropic pressure and a massive or\nself-interacting scalar field cannot be sources of gravitational fields with a\nnull but nonzero gradient of $r$.\n", "  In the presence of a complex classical dynamics associated with a mixed phase\nspace, a quantum wave function can tunnel between two stable islands through\nthe chaotic sea, an effect that has no classical counterpart. This phenomenon,\nreferred to as chaos assisted tunneling, is characterized by large fluctuations\nof the tunneling rate when a parameter is varied. To date the full extent of\nthis effect as well as the associated statistical distribution have never been\nobserved in a quantum system. Here we analyze the possibility of characterizing\nthese effects accurately in a cold atom experiment. Using realistic values of\nthe parameters of an experimental setup, we examine through analytical\nestimates and extensive numerical simulations a specific system that can be\nimplemented with cold atoms, the atomic modulated pendulum. We assess the\nefficiency of three possible routes to observe in detail chaos assisted\ntunneling properties. Our main conclusion is that due to the fragility of the\nsymmetry between positive and negative momenta as a function of quasimomentum,\nit is very challenging to use tunneling between classical islands centered on\nfixed points with opposite momentum. We show that it is more promising to use\nislands symmetric in position space, and characterize the regime where it could\nbe done. The proposed experiment could be realized with current\nstate-of-the-art technology.\n", "  We investigate the effect of a periodic potential generated by a\none-dimensional optical lattice on the magnetic properties of an $S=1/2$\nspin-orbit-coupled Bose gas. By increasing the lattice strength one can achieve\na magnetic phase transition between a polarized and an unpolarized Bloch wave\nphase, characterized by a significant enhancement of the contrast of the\ndensity fringes. If the wave vector of the periodic potential is chosen close\nto the roton momentum, the transition could take place at very small lattice\nintensities, revealing the strong enhancement of the response of the system to\na weak density perturbation. By solving the Gross-Pitaevskii equation in the\npresence of a three-dimensional trapping potential, we shed light on the\npossibility of observing the magnetic phase transition in currently available\nexperimental conditions.\n", "  Programable spatial light modulators (SLMs) have significantly advanced the\nconfigurable optical trapping of particles. Typically, these devices are\nutilized in the Fourier plane of an optical system, but direct imaging of an\namplitude pattern can potentially result in increased simplicity and\ncomputational speed. Here we demonstrate high-resolution direct imaging of a\ndigital micromirror device (DMD) at high numerical apertures (NA), which we\napply to the optical trapping of a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). We utilise a\n(1200 x 1920) pixel DMD and commercially available 0.45 NA microscope\nobjectives, finding that atoms confined in a hybrid optical/magnetic or\nall-optical potential can be patterned using repulsive blue-detuned (532 nm)\nlight with 630(10) nm full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) resolution, within 5%\nof the diffraction limit. The result is near arbitrary control of the density\nthe BEC without the need for expensive custom optics. We also introduce the\ntechnique of time-averaged DMD potentials, demonstrating the ability to produce\nmultiple grayscale levels with minimal heating of the atomic cloud, by\nutilising the high switching speed (20 kHz maximum) of the DMD. These\ntechniques will enable the realization and control of diverse optical\npotentials for superfluid dynamics and atomtronics applications with quantum\ngases. The performance of this system in a direct imaging configuration has\nwider application for optical trapping at non-trivial NAs.\n", "  The R_K measurement by LHCb suggests non-standard lepton non-universality\n(LNU) to occur in b -> s l+ l- transitions, with effects in muons rather than\nelectrons. A number of other measurements of b -> s l+ l- transitions by LHCb\nand B-factories display disagreement with the SM predictions and, remarkably,\nthese discrepancies are consistent in magnitude and sign with the R_K effect.\nNon-standard LNU suggests non-standard lepton flavor violation (LFV) as well,\nfor example in B -> K l l' and B_s -> l l'. There are good reasons to expect\nthat the new effects may be larger for generations closer to the third one. In\nthis case, the B_s -> mu e decay may be the most difficult to reach\nexperimentally. We propose and study in detail the radiative counterpart of\nthis decay, namely B_s -> mu e gamma, whereby the chiral-suppression factor is\nreplaced by a factor of order alpha/pi. A measurement of this mode would be\nsensitive to the same physics as the purely leptonic LFV decay and, depending\non experimental efficiencies, it may be more accessible. A realistic\nexpectation is a factor of two improvement in statistics for either of the\nB_{d,s} modes.\n", "  We investigate primordial gravitational waves and curvature perturbations in\nde Rham-Gabadadze-Tolley (dRGT) bimetric gravity. We evaluate the power-spectra\nin the leading order in slow roll. Taking into account the decay of massive\ngraviton, we find that the action up to the second order reduces to the\nEinstein theory with a non-minimally coupled scalar field, which is simplified\nto a minimally coupled model by conformal transformation. We also find that the\ntensor to scalar ratio for large field inflation with power law potential is\nlarger than the general relativity counterpart for any choice of parameters in\ndRGT bimetric gravity. In addition, we confirm that the usual consistency\nrelation holds and we have a steeper spectrum for gravitational waves.\n", "  We present optical spectroscopy, ultraviolet to infrared imaging and X-ray\nobservations of the intermediate luminosity optical transient (ILOT) SN 2010da\nin NGC 300 (d=1.86 Mpc) spanning from -6 to +6 years relative to the time of\noutburst in 2010. Based on the light curve and multi-epoch SEDs of SN 2010da,\nwe conclude that the progenitor of SN 2010da is a ~10-12 Msol yellow supergiant\npossibly transitioning into a blue loop phase. During outburst, SN 2010da had a\npeak absolute magnitude of M<-10.4 mag, dimmer than other ILOTs and supernova\nimpostors. We detect multi-component hydrogen Balmer, Paschen, and Ca II\nemission lines in our high-resolution spectra, which indicate a dusty and\ncomplex circumstellar environment. Since the 2010 eruption, the star has\nbrightened by a factor of ~5 and remains highly variable in the optical.\nFurthermore, we detect SN 2010da in archival Swift and Chandra observations as\nan ultraluminous X-ray source (L~6x10^{39} erg/s). We additionally attribute He\nII 4686 Angstrom and coronal Fe emission lines in addition to a steady X-ray\nluminosity of ~10^{37} erg/s to the presence of a compact companion.\n", "  While there are many dynamical mechanisms and models that try to explain the\norigin and phenomenology of the quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) seen in the\nX-ray light curves of low-mass X-ray binaries, few of them address how the\nradiative processes occurring in these extreme environments give rise to the\nrich set of variability features actually observed in these light curves. A\nstep towards this end comes from the study of the energy and frequency\ndependence of the phase lags of these QPOs. Here we used a methodology that\nallowed us to study, for the first time, the dependence of the phase lags of\nall QPOs in the range of 1 Hz to 1300 Hz detected in the low-mass X-ray binary\n4U 1636-53 upon energy and frequency as the source changes its states as it\nmoves through the colour-colour diagram. Our results suggest that within the\ncontext of models of up-scattering Comptonization, the phase lags dependencies\nupon frequency and energy can be used to extract size scales and physical\nconditions of the medium that produces the lags.\n", "  We theoretically study the superfluid phase of a strongly correlated\n$^{173}$Yb Fermi gas near its orbital Feshbach resonance, by developing a\nquantitative pair-fluctuation theory within a two-band model. We examine the\ndensity excitation spectrum of the system and determine a stability phase\ndiagram. We find that the $^{173}$Yb Fermi gas is intrinsically metastable and\nhas a peculiar equation of state, due to the small but positive singlet\nscattering length. The massive Leggett mode, arising from the fluctuation of\nthe relative phase of two order parameters, is severely damped. We discuss the\nparameter space where an undamped Leggett mode may exist.\n", "  The problem with the U-duality transformation of membrane on $T^{n}$ is\nrecently addressed in [arXiv:1509.02915 [hep-th]]. We will consider the\nU-duality transformation rule of membrane on $T^{n}\\times R$. It turns out that\nwinding modes on $T^{n}$ should be taken into account, since the duality\ntransformation may bring the membrane configuration without winding modes into\nthe one with winding modes. With the winding modes added, the membrane\nworldvolume theory in lightcone gauge is equivalent to the $n+1$ dimensional\nsuper-Yang-Mills (SYM) theory in $\\tilde{T}^{n}$, which has $SL(2,Z)\\times\nSL(3,Z)$ and $SL(5,Z)$ symmetries for $n=3$ and $n=4$, respectively. The\n$SL(2,Z)\\times SL(3,Z)$ transformation can be realized classically, making the\non-shell field configurations transformed into each other. However, the\n$SL(5,Z)$ symmetry may only be realized at the quantum level, since the\nclassical $5d$ SYM field configurations cannot form the representation of\n$SL(5,Z)$.\n", "  We demonstrate the appearance of thermal order by disorder in Ising\npyrochlores with staggered antiferromagnetic order frustrated by an applied\nmagnetic field. We use a mean-field cluster variational method, a\nlow-temperature expansion and Monte Carlo simulations to characterise the\norder-by-disorder transition. By direct evaluation of the density of states we\nquantitatively show how a symmetry-broken state is selected by thermal\nexcitations. We discuss the relevance of our results to experiments in $2d$ and\n$3d$ samples, and evaluate how anomalous finite-size effects could be exploited\nto detect this phenomenon experimentally in two-dimensional artificial systems,\nor in antiferromagnetic all-in--all-out pyrochlores like Nd$_2$Hf$_2$O$_7$ or\nNd$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$, for the first time.\n", "  We demonstrate the optical initialization of a hole-spin qubit bound to an\nisoelectronic center (IC) formed by a pair of Te impurities in ZnSe, an\nimpurity/host system providing high optical homogeneity, large electric dipole\nmoments, and long coherence times. The initialization scheme is based on the\nspin-preserving tunneling of a resonantly excited donor-bound exciton to a\npositively charged Te IC, thus forming a positive trion. The radiative decay of\nthe trion within less than 50 ps leaves a heavy hole in a well-defined\npolarization-controlled spin state. The initialization fidelity exceeds 98:5 %\nfor an initialization time of less than 150 ps.\n", "  Single phase nickel-cobalt-titanate thin films with a formula A1+2xTi1-xO3,\nwhere A is Ni2+,Co2+ and -0.25<x<1, were grown by pulsed laser deposition on\nsapphire substrates. There is a large window in which both Ni/Co ratio and x\ncan be chosen independently. In the prototype ilmenite and corundum structures\none third of the octahedra are vacant. The reported structure is obtained by\nfilling vacant (x>0) or emptying filled (x<0) octahedra. When x = 1 all\noctahedra are filled. Two factors controlling the magnetism and crystal\ndistortion are identified. First is a direct overlap between the adjacent\ncation d-orbitals resulting in a bond formation and magnetic interactions\nbetween the cations. This is most clearly revealed as a crystal distortion in\nthe x approximately 0 compositions with approximately equal amounts of Ni and\nCo: the distortion of the x approximately 0 compound is a function of Ni/Co\nratio. The second factor is x, which controls the cation shift towards a vacant\noctahedron. The displacement decreases and the symmetry increases with\ndecreasing Ti content as was revealed by x-ray diffraction and Raman\nspectroscopy. When all octahedra are filled the cations prefer octahedron\ncenter positions. Also the number density of cations has increased by a factor\nof 50 percent when compared to the ilmenite structure. The number density\nratios of Ni/Co cations between x=1 and x=0 compounds is 3. The Raman and x-ray\ndiffraction data collected on samples with x = 1 or close to 1 are interpreted\nin terms of P63/mmc space group.\n", "  We consider the dynamical atom-surface Casimir-Polder force in the\nnon-equilibrium configuration of an atom near a perfectly conducting wall,\ninitially prepared in an excited state with the field in its vacuum state. We\nevaluate the time-dependent Casimir-Polder force on the atom, and find that it\nshows an oscillatory behavior from attractive to repulsive both in time and in\nspace. We also investigate the asymptotic behavior in time of the dynamical\nforce and of related local field quantities, showing that the static value of\nthe force, as obtained by a time-independent approach, is recovered for times\nmuch larger than the timescale of the atomic self-dressing, but smaller than\nthe atomic decay time. We then discuss the evolution of global quantities such\nas atomic and field energies, and their asymptotic behavior. We also compare\nour results for the dynamical force on the excited atom with analogous results\nrecently obtained for an initially bare ground-state atom. We show that new\nrelevant features are obtained in the case of an initially excited atom, for\nexample much larger values of the dynamical force with respect to the static\none, allowing for an easier way to single-out and observe the dynamical\nCasimir-Polder effect.\n", "  Using the Geroch transformation we obtain the first example of an exact stiff\nfluid spike solution to the Einstein field equations in a closed form\nexhibiting a spacelike $G_1$ group of symmetries (i.e., with a single\nisometry). This new solution is of Petrov type I and exhibits a spike crossing\nwhich persists to the past, which allows us to better understand spike\ncrossings in the context of structure formation.\n", "  Quantum circuit synthesis is the process in which an arbitrary unitary\noperation is decomposed into a sequence of gates from a universal set,\ntypically one which a quantum computer can implement both efficiently and\nfault-tolerantly. As physical implementations of quantum computers improve, the\nneed is growing for tools which can effectively synthesize components of the\ncircuits and algorithms they will run. Existing algorithms for exact,\nmulti-qubit circuit synthesis scale exponentially in the number of qubits and\ncircuit depth, leaving synthesis intractable for circuits on more than a\nhandful of qubits. Even modest improvements in circuit synthesis procedures may\nlead to significant advances, pushing forward the boundaries of not only the\nsize of solvable circuit synthesis problems, but also in what can be realized\nphysically as a result of having more efficient circuits.\n  We present a method for quantum circuit synthesis using deterministic walks.\nAlso termed pseudorandom walks, these are walks in which once a starting point\nis chosen, its path is completely determined. We apply our method to construct\na parallel framework for circuit synthesis, and implement one such version\nperforming optimal $T$-count synthesis over the Clifford+$T$ gate set. We use\nour software to present examples where parallelization offers a significant\nspeedup on the runtime, as well as directly confirm that the 4-qubit 1-bit full\nadder has optimal $T$-count 7 and $T$-depth 3.\n", "  In this paper, we investigate the thermodynamic properties of black holes in\nthe framework of rainbow gravity. By considering rainbow functions in the\nmetric of Schwarzschild and Reissner-Nordstr\\\"{o}m black holes, remnant and\ncritical masses are found to exist. Demanding the universality of logarithmic\ncorrections to the semi-classical area law for the entropy leads to\nconstraining the form of the rainbow functions. The mass output and the\nradiation rate for these constrained form of rainbow functions have been\ncomputed for different values of the rainbow parameter $\\eta$ and have striking\nsimilarity to those derived from the generalized uncertainty principle.\n", "  This is an elementary review of the history and physics of neutrinos. The\nstory of the discovery of neutrino mass through neutrino oscillations is\ndescribed in some detail. Experiments on solar neutrinos and atmospheric\nneutrinos played an important part. Recent advances are summarized and future\ndevelopments are indicated.\n", "  The field of fragmentation functions of light quarks and gluons is reviewed.\nIn addition to integrated fragmentation functions, attention is paid to the\ndependence of fragmentation functions on transverse momenta and on polarization\ndegrees of freedom. Higher-twist and di-hadron fragmentation functions are\nconsidered as well. Moreover, the review covers both theoretical and\nexperimental developments in single-inclusive hadron production in\nelectron-positron annihilation, deep-inelastic lepton-nucleon scattering, and\nproton-proton collisions.\n", "  We present baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) scale measurements determined\nfrom the clustering of 1.2 million massive galaxies with redshifts 0.2 < z <\n0.75 distributed over 9300 square degrees, as quantified by their\nredshift-space correlation function. In order to facilitate these measurements,\nwe define, describe, and motivate the selection function for galaxies in the\nfinal data release (DR12) of the SDSS III Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic\nSurvey (BOSS). This includes the observational footprint, masks for image\nquality and Galactic extinction, and weights to account for density\nrelationships intrinsic to the imaging and spectroscopic portions of the\nsurvey. We simulate the observed systematic trends in mock galaxy samples and\ndemonstrate that they impart no bias on baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) scale\nmeasurements and have a minor impact on the recovered statistical uncertainty.\nWe measure transverse and radial BAO distance measurements in 0.2 < z < 0.5,\n0.5 < z < 0.75, and (overlapping) 0.4 < z < 0.6 redshift bins. In each redshift\nbin, we obtain a precision that is 2.7 per cent or better on the radial\ndistance and 1.6 per cent or better on the transverse distance. The combination\nof the redshift bins represents 1.8 per cent precision on the radial distance\nand 1.1 per cent precision on the transverse distance. This paper is part of a\nset that analyses the final galaxy clustering dataset from BOSS. The\nmeasurements and likelihoods presented here are combined with others in Alam et\nal. (2016) to produce the final cosmological constraints from BOSS.\n", "  We reveal the existence of a new type of topological Josephson effect\ninvolving type II superconductors and three-dimensional topological insulators\nas tunnel junctions. We predict that vortex lines induce a variant of the\nWitten effect that is the consequence of the axion electromagnetic response of\nthe topological insulator: at the interface of the junction each flux quantum\nattains a fractional electrical charge of e/4. As a consequence, if an external\nmagnetic field is applied perpendicular to the junction, the Witten effect\ninduces an AC Josephson effect in absence of any external voltage. We derive a\nnumber of further experimental consequences and propose potential setups where\nthese {quantized, flux induced, Witten} effects may be observed.\n", "  The interaction between the itinerant spins in metals and localized spins in\nmagnetic insulators thus far has only been explored in collinear spin systems,\nsuch as garnets. Here, we report the spin-Hall magnetoresistance (SMR)\nsensitive to the surface magnetization of the spin-spiral material, Cu_2OSeO_3.\nWe experimentally demonstrate that the angular dependence of the SMR changes\ndrastically at the transition between the helical spiral and the conical spiral\nphases. Furthermore, the sign and magnitude of the SMR in the conical spiral\nstate are controlled by the cone angle. We show that this complex behaviour can\nbe qualitatively explained within the SMR theory initially developed for\ncollinear magnets. In addition, we studied the spin Seebeck effect (SSE), which\nis sensitive to the bulk magnetization. It originates from the conversion of\nthermally excited low-energy spin waves in the magnet, known as magnons, into\nthe spin current in the adjacent metal contact (Pt). The SSE displays\nunconventional behavior where not only the magnitude but also the phase of the\nSSE vary with the applied magnetic field.\n", "  Cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) was shown to affect cells not only directly,\nbut also indirectly by means of plasma pre-treated solution. This study\ninvestigated a new application of CAP generated in deionized (DI) water for the\ncancer therapy. In our experiments, the CAP solution was generated in DI water\nusing helium as carrier gas. We report on the effects of this plasma solution\nin breast (MDA-MD-231) and gastric (NCI-N87) cancer cells. The results revealed\nthat apoptosis efficiency was dependent on the plasma exposure time and on the\nlevels of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS and RNS). The plasma\nsolution that resulted from 30-minute treatment of DI water had the most\nsignificant effect in the rate of apoptosis.\n", "  Kinetics of molecular oxygen / Au (001) surface interaction has been studied\nat high temperature and near atmospheric pressures of O2 gas with in situ x-ray\nscattering measurements. We find that the hexagonal reconstruction (hex) of Au\n(001) surface lifts to (1x1) in the presence of O2 gas, indicating that the\n(1x1) is more favored when some oxygen atoms present on the surface. The\nmeasured lifting rate constant vs. temperature is found to be highest at\nintermediate temperature exhibiting a 'volcano'-type behavior. At low\ntemperature, the hex-to-(1x1) activation barrier (Eact = 1.3(3) eV) limits the\nlifting. At high temperature, oxygen adsorption energy (Eads = 1.6(2) eV)\nlimits the lifting. The (1x1)-to-hex activation barrier (Ehex = 0.41(14) eV) is\nalso obtained from hex recovery kinetics. The pressure-temperature (PT) surface\nphase diagram obtained in this study shows three regions: hex at low P and T,\n(1x1) at high P and T, and coexistence of the hex and (1x1) at the intermediate\nP and T.\n", "  We demonstrate high-resolution non-iterative holographic coherent diffraction\nimaging with hard X-rays using a novel phase-shifting reference, fabricated by\natomic layer deposition to produce nanosharp 3D structure. The method surpasses\nthe limitations associated with absorbing substrates predominantly employed in\nsoft X-ray holography using extended, customized and point-source references.\nThe unconfined experimental setup relaxes the technical constraints, allows\neffective data correction, and enables independent sample translation and\nrotation for data averaging and tomography. Applicable to single-shot\nmeasurements, phase and amplitude reconstructions of samples are retrieved with\nsingle-pixel resolution and differential contrast by simple non-iterative\ncomputation.\n", "  We derive the second-order QCD corrections to the production of a Higgs boson\nrecoiling against a parton with finite transverse momentum, working in the\neffective field theory in which the top quark contributions are integrated out.\nTo account for quark mass effects, we supplement the effective field theory\nresult by the full quark mass dependence at leading order. Our calculation is\nfully differential in the final state kinematics and includes the decay of the\nHiggs boson to a photon pair. It allows one to make next-to-next-to- leading\norder (NNLO)-accurate theory predictions for Higgs-plus-jet final states and\nfor the transverse momentum distribution of the Higgs boson, accounting for the\nexperimental definition of the fiducial cross sections. The NNLO QCD\ncorrections are found to be moderate and positive, they lead to a substantial\nreduction of the theory uncertainty on the predictions. We compare our results\nto 8 TeV LHC data from ATLAS and CMS. While the shape of the data is\nwell-described for both experiments, we agree on the normalization only for\nCMS. By normalizing data and theory to the inclusive fiducial cross section for\nHiggs production, good agreement is found for both experiments, however at the\nexpense of an increased theory uncertainty. We make predictions for Higgs\nproduction observables at the 13 TeV LHC, which are in good agreement with\nrecent ATLAS data. At this energy, the leading order mass corrections to the\neffective field theory prediction become significant at large transverse\nmomenta, and we discuss the resulting uncertainties on the predictions.\n", "  Quantum-enhanced metrology aims to estimate an unknown parameter such that\nthe precision scales better than the shot-noise bound. Single-shot adaptive\nquantum-enhanced metrology (AQEM) is a promising approach that uses feedback to\ntweak the quantum process according to previous measurement outcomes.\nTechniques and formalism for the adaptive case are quite different from the\nusual non-adaptive quantum metrology approach due to the causal relationship\nbetween measurements and outcomes. We construct a formal framework for AQEM by\nmodeling the procedure as a decision-making process, and we derive the\nimprecision and the Cram\\'{e}r-Rao lower bound with explicit dependence on the\nfeedback policy. We also explain the reinforcement learning approach for\ngenerating quantum control policies, which is adopted due to the optimal policy\nbeing non-trivial to devise. Applying a learning algorithm based on\ndifferential evolution enables us to attain imprecision for adaptive\ninterferometric phase estimation, which turns out to be SQL when non-entangled\nparticles are used in the scheme.\n", "  We show that Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) geometry with flat spatial\nsection in quantized (Wheeler deWitt quantization) Brans Dicke (BD) theory\nreveals a rich phase structure owing to anomalous breaking of a classical\nsymmetry, which maps the scale factor $a\\mapsto\\lambda a$ for some constant\n$\\lambda$. In the weak coupling ($\\omega$) limit, the theory goes from a\nsymmetry preserving phase to a broken phase. The existence of phase boundary is\nan obstruction to another classical symmetry [arXiv:gr-qc/9902083] (which\nrelates two BD theory with different coupling) admitted by BD theory with scale\ninvariant matter content i.e $T^{\\mu}{}_{\\mu}=0$. Classically, this prohibits\nthe BD theory to reduce to General Relativity (GR) for scale invariant matter\ncontent. We show that strong coupling limit of BD and GR both preserves the\nsymmetry involving scale factor. We also show that with a scale invariant\nmatter content (radiation i.e $P=\\frac{1}{3}\\rho$), the quantized BD theory\ndoes reduce to GR as $\\omega\\rightarrow\\infty$, which is in sharp contrast to\nclassical behavior. This is a first known illustration of a scenario, where\nquantized BD theory provides example of anomalous symmetry breaking and\nresulting binary phase structure. We make a conjecture regarding strong\ncoupling limit of BD theory in generic scenario.\n", "  We investigate, by means of a field-theory analysis combined with the\ndensity-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method, a theoretical model for a\nstrongly correlated quantum system in one dimension realizing a\ntopologically-ordered Haldane phase ground state. The model consists of a\nspin-1/2 Heisenberg chain coupled to a tight-binding chain via two competing\nKondo exchange couplings of different type: a \"s-wave\" Kondo coupling\n($J^s_{K}$), and a less common \"p-wave\" ($J^p_{K}$) Kondo coupling. While the\nfirst coupling is the standard Kondo interaction studied in many\ncondensed-matter systems, the latter has been recently introduced by Alexandrov\nand Coleman [Phys. Rev. B 90, 115147 (2014)] as a possible mechanism leading to\na topological Kondo-insulating ground state in one dimension. As a result of\nthis competition, a topological quantum phase transition (TQPT) occurs in the\nsystem for a critical value of the ratio $J^s_{K}/J^p_{K}$, separating a\n(Haldane-type) topological phase from a topologically trivial ground state\nwhere the system can be essentially described as a product of local singlets.\nWe study and characterize the TQPT by means for the magnetization profile, the\nentanglement entropy and the full entanglement spectrum of the ground state.\nOur results might be relevant to understand how topologically-ordered phases of\nfermions emerge in strongly interacting quantum systems.\n", "  The Kondo effect of a Co atom on Cu(100) was investigated with a\nlow-temperature scanning tunneling microscope using a monoatomically sharp\nnickel tip. Upon a tip-Co contact, the differential conductance spectra exhibit\na spin-split asymmetric Kondo resonance. The computed ab initio value of the\nexchange coupling is too small to suppress the Kondo effect, but sufficiently\nlarge to produce the splitting observed. A quantitative analysis of the line\nshape using the numerical renormalization group technique indicates that the\njunction spin polarization is weak.\n", "  Comment on a recent paper published in Physical Review Letters by M. C. Wang,\nS. Qiao, Z. Jiang, S. N. Luo, and J. Qi [Phys. Rev. Lett. 116, 036601 (2016),\narXiv:1511.02994v2].\n", "  Using an ultrafast laser pulse to manipulate the spin degree of freedom has\nbroad technological appeal. It allows one to control the spin dynamics on a\nfemtosecond time scale. The discipline, commonly called femtomagnetism, started\nwith the pioneering experiment by Beaurepaire and coworkers in 1996, who showed\nsubpicosecond demagnetization occurs in magnetic Ni thin films. This finding\nhas motivated extensive research worldwide. All-optical helicity-dependent spin\nswitching (AOS) represents a new frontier in femtomagnetism, where a single\nultrafast laser pulse can permanently switch spin without any assistance from a\nmagnetic field. This review summarizes some of the crucial aspects of this new\ndiscipline: key experimental findings, leading mechanisms, controversial\nissues, and possible future directions. The emphasis is on our latest\ninvestigation. We first develop the all-optical spin switching rule that\ndetermines how the switchability depends on the light helicity. This rule\nallows one to understand microscopically how the spin is reversed and why the\ncircularly polarized light appears more powerful than the linearly polarized\nlight. Then we invoke our latest spin-orbit coupled harmonic oscillator model\nto simulate single spin reversal. We consider both cw excitation and pulsed\nlaser excitation. The results are in a good agreement with the experimental\nresult. We then extend the code to include the exchange interaction among\ndifferent spin sites. We show where the \"inverse Faraday field\" comes from and\nhow the laser affects the spin reversal nonlinearly. Our hope is that this\nreview will motivate new experimental and theoretical investigations and\ndiscussions.\n", "  We study theoretically the transverse spin associated with the eigenmodes of\na thin metal film embedded in a dielectric. We show that the transverse spin\nhas a direct dependence on the nature and strength of the coupling leading to\ntwo distinct branches for the long- and short- range modes. We show that the\nshort-range mode exhibits larger extraordinary spin because of its more\n'structured' nature due to higher decay in propagation. In contrast to some of\nthe earlier studies, calculations are performed retaining the full lossy\ncharacter of the metal. In the limit of vanishing losses we present analytical\nresults for the extraordinary spin for both the coupled modes. The results can\nhave direct implications for enhancing the elusive transverse spin exploiting\nthe coupled plasmon structures.\n", "  On 2008 October 7, small asteroid 2008 TC3 turned itself into the parent body\nof the first meteor ever to be predicted before entering the Earth's\natmosphere. Over five years later, the 2014 AA event became the second instance\nof such an occurrence. The uncertainties associated with the pre-impact orbit\nof 2008 TC3 are relatively small because thousands of observations were made\nduring the hours preceding the actual meteor airburst. In sharp contrast, 2014\nAA was only observed seven times before impact and consequently its trajectory\nis somewhat uncertain. Here, we present a recalculation of the impact\nparameters -location and timing- of this meteor based on infrasound recordings.\nThe new values and their uncertainties together with Monte Carlo and N-body\ntechniques, are applied to obtain an independent determination of the\npre-impact orbit of 2014 AA. Our orbital solution is used to investigate the\npossible presence of known near-Earth objects (NEOs) moving in similar orbits.\nPrior to impact, 2014 AA was subjected to a web of overlapping secular\nresonances and it followed a path similar to those of 2011 GJ3, 2011 JV10, 2012\nDJ54, and 2013 NJ4. NEOs in this transient group have their orbits controlled\nby close encounters with the Earth-Moon system at perihelion and Mars at\naphelion, perhaps constituting a dynamical family. Extensive comparison with\nother studies is also presented.\n", "  Implementation of real-time, continuous, and three-dimensional imaging (4D\nintervention guidance) would be a quantum leap for minimally-invasive medicine.\nIt allows guidance during interventions by assessing the spatial position of\ninstruments continuously in respect to their surroundings. Recent research\nshowed that it is feasible using X-ray and novel tomographic reconstruction\napproaches. Radiation dose stays within reasonable limits. This article\nprovides abstractions and background information together with an outlook on\nthese prospects. There are explanations of how situational awareness during\ninterventions is generated today and how they will be in future. The\ndifferences between fluoroscopically and CT-guided interventions are eluted to\nwithin the context of these developments. The exploration of uncharted terrain\nbetween these current methods is worth pursuing. Necessary image quality of 4D\nintervention guidance varies relevantly from that of standard computed\ntomography. Means to analyze the risk-benefit ratio of 4D intervention guidance\nare provided and arguments for gantry-based setups vs C-arm based setups are\ngiven. Due to the lack of moving organs, neuro-interventions might be the first\nfield in which 4D intervention guidance might become available, however,\nregistration and fusion algorithms might make it applicable in complex\nwhole-body interventions such as aortic valve replacement soon thereafter.\n", "  I discuss a variety of issues relating to near-future experiments\ndemonstrating fault-tolerant quantum computation. I describe a family of\nfault-tolerant quantum circuits that can be performed with 5 qubits arranged on\na ring with nearest-neighbor interactions. I also present a criterion whereby\nwe can say that an experiment has succeeded in demonstrating fault tolerance.\nFinally, I discuss the possibility of using future fault-tolerant experiments\nto answer important questions about the interaction of fault-tolerant protocols\nwith real experimental errors.\n", "  The study of Galactic Cosmic-ray electrons (CREs) saw important developments\nin recent years, with the assumption of positron production only in interaction\nof hadronic Cosmic-rays with interstellar matter challenged by new measurements\nof CRE spectrum and related quantities. Indeed, all recent experiments seem to\nconfirm an hardening in the positrons, a feature that is totally in contrast\nwith the all-secondaries hypothesis, even if significant disagreements are\npresent about the CRE spectral behavior and the possible presence of spectral\nfeatures. Together with insufficient precision of current measurements, these\ndisagreements prevent the identification of the primary positron source, with\nmodels involving Dark matter or astrophysical sources like Super Nova Remnants\nand Pulsar Wind Nebula all able to explain current data.\n  The fermi-LAT contribution to the CRE study was fundamental, with the 2009\nmeasurement of the positron + electron spectrum extended to the 7 MeV - 1TeV\nrange with a statistics already exceeding previous results by many order of\nmagnitude; since then, the last statistic has largely increased, while the LAT\nevent reconstruction was significantly improved.\n  In this article the reader will find an extensive and historical review of\nthe CRE science, a summary of the history of gamma astronomy before fermi, an\naccurate description of the LAT and of its data analysis, a review of the\npresent knowledge about CRE spectrum and on the theories that try to explain\nit, and finally a description of the changes and improvements introduced in the\nLAT event reconstruction process at the beginning of 2015.\n", "  Circumstellar disks around young stars are the birthsites of planets. It is\nthus fundamental to study the disks in which they form, their structure and the\nphysical conditions therein. The first astronomical unit is of great interest\nbecause this is where the terrestrial-planets form and the angular momentum is\ncontroled via massloss through winds/jets. With its milli-arcsecond resolution,\noptical interferometry is the only technic able to spatially resolve the first\nfew astronomical units of the disk. In this review, we will present a broad\noverview of studies of young stellar objects with interferometry, and discuss\nprospects for the future.\n", "  The thermal conductivity, heat capacity and heat release of NbTi, NbTi-H and\nNbTi-D were measured at low temperatures. All three systems reveal low\ntemperature anomalies typical for structural glasses. It is shown that above a\nconcentration of 2\\% H or D the tunneling states of the NbTi matrix disappear.\nTherefore, for higher concentration it is a good system to proof how the change\nof the mass of tunneling atoms influences the low temperature anomalies. For\nthe heat capacity we found the expected isotopic effect. However, the anomalous\nisotopic effect observed for the heat release data cannot be explained within\nthe standard tunneling model. A surprising result is that tunneling systems\nwith very high barrier heights, even the systems with the maximum barrier\nheight, influence remarkable the heat capacity and the heat release data at low\ntemperatures. As a possible origin, we consider large-scale fluctuations in\nthermal expansion which could generate anomalous two-level systems.\n", "  The bound state solutions of the $D$-dimensional Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation for\nnew mixed class of potential, $V(r)=\\frac{V_1}{r^2}+\\frac{V_2e^{-\\alpha\nr}}{r}+V_3coth\\alpha r+V_4\\,,$ are studied within the framework of the Pekeris\napproximation for any arbitrary $\\ell$-state. Asymptotic iteration method (AIM)\nis used for the work. The energy spectrum are obtained as well as their\ncorresponding normalized eigenfunctions are derived in terms of generalized\nhypergeometric functions $\\,_{2}F_{1}(a,b,c;z)$. It is shown that using the\nPekeris approximation, present potential model is very much capable of deriving\nother well known potentials quite easily and corresponding solutions are in\nexcellent agreement with the previous work carried out in literature.\n", "  It is shown theoretically that the use of accelerating spatiotemporal\nquasi-phase-matching (QPM) modulation patterns in media with parametric optical\ninteractions makes it possible to generate a time-reversed replica of the pump\npulse envelope in a frequency converted signal. The conversion is dependent on\nthe group-velocity mismatch between the fundamental and up-converted harmonics,\nand controlled by the acceleration rate (chirp) of the QPM phase pattern.\nAnalytical results are corroborated by numerical simulations.\n", "  Collective cell motility plays central roles in various biological phenomena\nsuch as inflammatory response, wound healing, cancer metastasis and\nembryogenesis. These are biological demonstrations of the unjamming transition.\nHowever, contradictory to the typical density-driven jamming processes in\nparticulate assemblies, cellular systems often get unjammed in highly packed,\nsometimes overcrowding tissue environments. In this work, we report that\novercrowding can unjam gap-free monolayers through increasing isotropic\ncompression. The transition boundary is determined by the isotropic compression\nand the cell-cell adhesion. We explicitly construct the free energy landscape\nfor the T1 topological transition during monolayer rearrangement, and find that\nit evolves from single-barrier shape to double-barrier shape upon completion of\nthe unjamming process. Our analyses reveal that the overcrowding and adhesion\ninduced unjamming transition reflects the mechanical yielding of the highly\ndeformable monolayer, which differs from those caused by loosing up a packed\nparticulate assembly.\n", "  The existence of the limit of a sample scattering intensity, as the\nscattering vector approaches zero, requires and is ensured by the property that\nthe mean value of the scattering density fluctuation over volume $V$\nasymptotically behaves, at large $V$s, as $\\nu V^{-1/2}$, $\\nu$ being an\nappropriate constant. Then, the limit of the normalized scattering intensity is\nequal to $\\nu^2$. The implications of this result are also analyzed in the case\nof samples made up of two homogeneous phases.16 pages, 3 figures\n", "  This paper considers metric spaces where distances between a pair of nodes\nare represented by distance intervals. The goal is to study methods for the\ndetermination of hierarchical clusters, i.e., a family of nested partitions\nindexed by a resolution parameter, induced from the given distance intervals of\nthe metric spaces. Our construction of hierarchical clustering methods is based\non defining admissible methods to be those methods that abide to the axioms of\nvalue - nodes in a metric space with two nodes are clustered together at the\nconvex combination of the distance bounds between them - and transformation -\nwhen both distance bounds are reduced, the output may become more clustered but\nnot less. Two admissible methods are constructed and are shown to provide\nuniversal upper and lower bounds in the space of admissible methods. Practical\nimplications are explored by clustering moving points via snapshots and by\nclustering networks representing brain structural connectivity using the lower\nand upper bounds of the network distance. The proposed clustering methods\nsucceed in identifying underlying clustering structures via the maximum and\nminimum distances in all snapshots, as well as in differentiating brain\nconnectivity networks of patients from those of healthy controls.\n", "  We report the results from our first-generation experiment to measure the\nmagnetic-dipole transition moment (M1) between the $6S_{1/2}$ and $5D_{3/2}$\nmanifolds in Ba$^{+}$. Knowledge of M1 is crucial for the proposed\nparity-nonconservation experiment in the ion \\cite{Fortson93}, where M1 will be\na leading source of systematic error. To date, no measurement of M1 has been\nmade in Ba$^{+}$, and moreover, the sensitivity of the moment to\nelectron-electron correlations has confounded accurate theoretical predictions.\nA precise measurement may help to resolve the theoretical discrepancies while\nproviding essential information for planning a future PNC measurement in\nBa$^{+}$. We demonstrate our technique for measuring M1 - including a method\nfor calibrating for stress-induced birefringence introduced by the scientific\napparatus - and place an upper bound of $\\mathrm{M1} < 93 \\pm 39 \\times 10^{-5}\n\\mu_{B}$.\n", "  We explored the issues related to the resolution and the modulation\nextinction when filtering the spectrum of a UV femtosecond laser with a\nstandard ultrashort pulse shaper. We have learned that a higher pulse shaping\nresolution often requires a larger working beam size or a higher density\ngrating for greater dispersion. However, these approaches also introduce more\noptical errors and degrade the extinction. In this work, we examined specifics\nof each component to determine the best configuration of our spectral filtering\nsetup. As a proof-of-concept demonstration, we utilized elements available as\nstandard products and achieved 100 GHz filtering resolution with high\nextinction at the UV-A wavelength, which is superb in this wavelength range.\nThe high extinction spectral filtering is especially important while modifying\na broadband laser for the optical control of molecule's internal state.\n", "  Dynamical systems of N particles in \\R^{D} interacting by a singular pair\npotential of mean field type are considered. The systems are assumed to be of\ngradient type and the existence of a macroscopic limit in the many particle\nlimit is established for a large class of singular interaction potentials in\nthe stochastic as well as the deterministic settings. The main assumption on\nthe potentials is an appropriate notion of quasi-convexity. When D=1 the\nconvergence result is sharp when applied to strongly singular repulsive\ninteractions and for a general dimension D the result applies to attractive\ninteractions with Lipschitz singular interaction potentials, leading to\nstochastic particle solutions to the corresponding macroscopic aggregation\nequations. The proof uses the theory of gradient flows in Wasserstein spaces of\nAmbrosio-Gigli-Savaree.\n", "  Critical fluctuations change the effective anisotropy of cubic ferromagnet\nnear the Curie point. If the crystal undergoes phase transition into\northorhombic phase and the initial anisotropy is not too strong, reduced\nanisotropy of nonlinear susceptibility acquires at $T_c$ the universal value\n$\\delta_4^* = {{2v^*} \\over {3(u^* + v^*)}}$ where $u^*$ and $v^*$ --\ncoordinates of the cubic fixed point on the flow diagram of renormalization\ngroup equations. In the paper, the critical value of the reduced anisotropy is\nestimated within the pseudo-$\\epsilon$ expansion approach. The six-loop\npseudo-$\\epsilon$ expansions for $u^*$, $v^*$, and $\\delta_4^*$ are derived for\nthe arbitrary spin dimensionality $n$. For cubic crystals ($n = 3$)\nhigher-order coefficients of the pseudo-$\\epsilon$ expansions obtained turn out\nto be so small that use of simple Pad\\'e approximants yields reliable numerical\nresults. Pad\\'e resummation of the pseudo-$\\epsilon$ series for $u^*$, $v^*$,\nand $\\delta_4^*$ leads to the estimate $\\delta_4^* = 0.079 \\pm 0.006$\nindicating that detection of the anisotropic critical behavior of cubic\nferromagnets in physical and computer experiments is certainly possible.\n", "  Magnetic excitation in a spin dimer system on a bilayer honeycomb lattice is\ninvestigated in the presence of a zigzag edge, where disordered and ordered\nphases can be controlled by a quantum phase transition. In analogy with the\ncase of graphene with a zigzag edge, a flat edge magnon mode appears in the\ndisordered phase. In an ordered phase, a finite magnetic moment generates a\nmean-field potential to the magnon. Since the potential is nonuniform on the\nedge and bulk sites, it affects the excitation, and the dispersion of the edge\nmode deviates from the flat shape. We investigate how the edge magnon mode\nevolves when the phase changes through the quantum phase transition and discuss\nthe similarities to ordered spin systems on a monolayer honeycomb lattice.\n", "  Invisibility dips, minima in scattering spectrum associated with asymmetric\nFano-like line-shapes, have been predicted with transformation optics in\nstudying strong coupling between two plasmonic nanoparticles. This feature of\nstrongly coupled plasmonic nanoparticles holds promise for sensor cloaking. It\nrequires an extremely narrow gap between the two nanoparticles, though,\npreventing its experimental observation at optical frequencies. Here, the\nconcept of spoof surface plasmons is utilized to facilitate the strong coupling\nbetween two spoof-localized-surface-plasmon (SLSP) resonators. Instead of\nobserving in far field, the near-field energy transport is probed through the\ntwo SLSP resonators. By virtue of enhanced coupling between the two resonators\nstacked vertically, a spectral transmission dip with asymmetric Fano-like\nline-shape, similar to the far-field invisibility dips predicted by\ntransformation optics, is observed. The underlying mode interference mechanism\nis further demonstrated by directly imaging the field maps of interfered waves\nthat are tightly localized around the resonators. These near-field invisibility\ndips may find use in near-field sensing, on-chip switching, filters and logical\noperation elements.\n", "  In an era of unprecedented deluge of (mostly unstructured) data, graphs are\nproving more and more useful, across the sciences, as a flexible abstraction to\ncapture complex relationships between complex objects. One of the main\nchallenges arising in the study of such networks is the inference of\nmacroscopic, large-scale properties affecting a large number of objects, based\nsolely on the microscopic interactions between their elementary constituents.\nStatistical physics, precisely created to recover the macroscopic laws of\nthermodynamics from an idealized model of interacting particles, provides\nsignificant insight to tackle such complex networks.\n  In this dissertation, we use methods derived from the statistical physics of\ndisordered systems to design and study new algorithms for inference on graphs.\nOur focus is on spectral methods, based on certain eigenvectors of carefully\nchosen matrices, and sparse graphs, containing only a small amount of\ninformation. We develop an original theory of spectral inference based on a\nrelaxation of various mean-field free energy optimizations. Our approach is\ntherefore fully probabilistic, and contrasts with more traditional motivations\nbased on the optimization of a cost function. We illustrate the efficiency of\nour approach on various problems, including community detection, randomized\nsimilarity-based clustering, and matrix completion.\n", "  A key factor preventing the market penetration of renewable, intermittent\nenergy sources, such as solar, wind and wave, is the lack of cost-effective\nenergy storage options to counteract intermittency. Here, we propose and\ndemonstrate a novel flow battery architecture that replaces traditional\nion-exchange membranes with less expensive heterogeneous flow-through porous\nmedia. We present an experimentally-validated model which demonstrates that our\narchitecture promises reduced crossover of reactive species compared to typical\nmembraneless systems employing co-laminar flows in open channels. In addition,\nour prototype battery exhibits significantly improved power density (0.925\nW/cm2) and maximum current density (3 A/cm2) compared to previous membraneless\nsystems.\n", "  Weyl fermions1 do not appear in nature as elementary particles, but they are\nnow found to exist as nodal points in the band structure of electronic and\nclassical wave crystals. Novel phenomena such as Fermi arcs and chiral anomaly\nhave fueled the interest of these topological points which are frequently\nperceived as monopoles in momentum space. Here, we demonstrate that generalized\nWeyl points can exist in a parameter space and we report the first observation\nof such nodal points in one-dimensional photonic crystals in the optical range.\nThe reflection phase inside the band gap of a truncated photonic crystal\nexhibits vortexes in the parameter space where the Weyl points are defined and\nthey share the same topological charges as the Weyl points. These vortexes\nguarantee the existence of interface states, the trajectory of which can be\nunderstood as \"Fermi arcs\" emerging from the Weyl nodes.\n", "  We propose a simple discrete time semi-supervised graph embedding approach to\nlink prediction in dynamic networks. The learned embedding reflects information\nfrom both the temporal and cross-sectional network structures, which is\nperformed by defining the loss function as a weighted sum of the supervised\nloss from past dynamics and the unsupervised loss of predicting the\nneighborhood context in the current network. Our model is also capable of\nlearning different embeddings for both formation and dissolution dynamics.\nThese key aspects contributes to the predictive performance of our model and we\nprovide experiments with three real--world dynamic networks showing that our\nmethod is comparable to state of the art methods in link formation prediction\nand outperforms state of the art baseline methods in link dissolution\nprediction.\n", "  Activation cross sections of proton induced reactions on gold for production\nof $^{197m,197g,195m,195g, 193m,193g,192}$Hg,\n$^{196m,196g(cum),195g(cum),194,191(cum)}$Au, $^{191(cum)}$Pt and $^{192}$Ir\nwere measured up to 65 MeV proton energy, some of them for the first time. The\nnew data are in acceptably good agreement with the recently published earlier\nexperimental data in the overlapping energy region. The experimental data are\ncompared with the predictions of the TALYS 1.6 (results in TENDL-2015 on-line\nlibrary) and EMPIRE 3.2 code.\n", "  Fiber transport of multi-dimensional photonic qudits promises high\ninformation capacity per photon without space restriction. This work\nexperimentally demonstrates transmission of spatial qudits through multi-core\noptical fibers and measurement of the entanglement between two fibers with\nquantum state analyzers, each composed of a spatial light modulator and a\nsingle-mode fiber. Quantum state tomography reconstructs the four-dimension\nentangled state that verifies the non-locality through concurrences in\ntwo-dimensional subspaces and a high-dimensional Bell-type CGLMP inequality.\n", "  In this study, we systematically investigate 3D momentum($\\hbar k$)-resolved\nelectronic structures of Ruddlesden-Popper-type iridium oxides\nSr$_{n+1}$Ir$_n$O$_{3n+1}$ using soft-x-ray (SX) angle-resolved photoemission\nspectroscopy (ARPES). Our results provide direct evidence of an\ninsulator-to-metal transition that occurs upon increasing the dimensionality of\nthe IrO$_2$-plane structure. This transition occurs when the spin-orbit-coupled\n$j_{\\rm eff}$=1/2 band changes its behavior in the dispersion relation and\nmoves across the Fermi energy. In addition, an emerging band along the\n$\\Gamma$(0,0,0)-R($\\pi$,$\\pi$,$\\pi$) direction is found to play a crucial role\nin the metallic characteristics of SrIrO$_3$. By scanning the photon energy\nover 350 eV, we reveal the 3D Fermi surface in SrIrO$_3$ and $k_z$-dependent\noscillations of photoelectron intensity in Sr$_3$Ir$_2$O$_7$. In contrast to\npreviously reported results obtained using low-energy photons, folded bands\nderived from lattice distortions and/or magnetic ordering make significantly\nweak (but finite) contributions to the $k$-resolved photoemission spectrum. At\nthe first glance, this leads to the ambiguous result that the observed\n$k$-space topology is consistent with the unfolded Brillouin zone (BZ) picture\nderived from a non-realistic simple square or cubic Ir lattice. Through careful\nanalysis, we determine that a superposition of the folded and unfolded band\nstructures has been observed in the ARPES spectra obtained using photons in\nboth ultraviolet and SX regions. To corroborate the physics deduced using\nlow-energy ARPES studies, we propose to utilize SX-ARPES as a powerful\ncomplementary technique, as this method surveys more than one whole BZ and\nprovides a panoramic view of electronic structures.\n", "  Ordered W-doped Ta2O5 nanotube arrays were grown by self-organizing\nelectrochemical anodization of TaW alloys with different tungsten\nconcentrations and by a suitable high temperature ammonia treatment, fully\nconverted to W:Ta3N5 tubular structures. A main effect found is that W doping\ncan decrease the band gap from 2 eV (bare Ta3N5) down to 1.75 eV. Ta3N5\nnanotubes grown on 0.5 at% W alloy and modified with (CoOH)x as co-catalyst\nshow ~33% higher photocurrents in photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting\nthan pure Ta3N5.\n", "  Despite the great success of the Standard Model of particle physics the\nnature of Dark Matter still remains unclear. Recently, the idea of the\nexistence of a hidden sector coupling only weakly with the ordinary matter was\nrevitalized and gained popularity. A simple mediator between the hidden and the\nvisible sector could be a vector particle of a new gauge interaction, the so\ncalled dark photon. Numerous of activities were initiated to probe its\nparameter space. The present results and the foreseen experiments aimed to\nsearch for dark photons in few directions are reviewed and discussed.\n", "  How do flocks, herds and swarms proceed through disordered environments? This\nquestion is not only crucial to animal groups in the wild, but also to\nvirtually all applications of collective robotics, and active materials\ncomposed of synthetic motile units. In stark contrast, appart from very rare\nexceptions, our physical understanding of flocking has been hitherto limited to\nhomogeneous media. Here we explain how collective motion survives to\ngeometrical disorder. To do so, we combine experiments on motile colloids\ncruising through random microfabricated obstacles, and analytical theory. We\nexplain how disorder and bending elasticity compete to channel the flow of\npolar flocks along sparse river networks akin those found beyond plastic\ndepinning in driven condensed matter. Further increasing disorder, we\ndemonstrate that collective motion is suppressed in the form of a first-order\nphase transition generic to all polar active materials.\n", "  Molecular features such as the G-band, CN-band and NH-band are important\ndiagnostics for measuring a star's carbon and nitrogen abundances, especially\nin metal-poor stars where atomic lines are no longer visible in stellar\nspectra. Unlike atomic transitions, molecular features tend to form in bands,\nwhich cover large wavelength regions in a spectrum. While it is a trivial\nmatter to compute carbon and nitrogen molecular bands under the assumption of\n1D, it is extremely time consuming in 3D. In this contribution to the 2016\nCO5BOLD workshop we review the improvements made to the 3D spectral synthesis\ncode Linfor3D, and discuss the new challenges found when computing molecular\nfeatures in 3D.\n", "  We present a generalized picture of intermittency in turbulence that is based\non the theory of stochastic processes. To this end, we rely on the\nexperimentally and numerically verified finding by R.~Friedrich and J.~Peinke\n[Phys. Rev. Lett. 78, 863 (1997)] that allows for an interpretation of the\nturbulent energy cascade as a Markov process of the velocity increments in\nscale. It is explicitly shown that all known phenomenological models of\nturbulence can be reproduced by the Kramers-Moyal expansion of the velocity\nincrement probability density function that is associated to a Markov process.\nWe compare the different sets of Kramers-Moyal coefficients of each\nphenomenology and deduce that an accurate description of intermittency should\ntake into account an infinite number of coefficients. This is demonstrated in\nmore detail for the case of Burgers turbulence that exhibits the strongest\nintermittency effects. Moreover, the influence of nonlocality on the\nKramers-Moyal coefficients is investigated by direct numerical simulations of a\ngeneralized Burgers equation. Depending on the balance between nonlinearity and\nnonlocality, we encounter different intermittency behaviour that ranges from\nself-similarity (purely nonlocal case) to intermittent behaviour (intermediate\ncase that agrees with Yakhot's mean field theory [Phys. Rev. E 63 026307\n(2001)]) to shock-like behaviour (purely nonlinear Burgers case).\n", "  After highlighting the importance of neutrino cross section modeling for\nneutrino oscillation measurements, the most recent neutrino cross section\nmeasurements are presented. New preliminary results are available from T2K for\nthe measurement of charged current interactions on carbon without pions in the\nfinal state, single pion production in water, coherent pion production in\ncarbon and charged current inclusive interactions in carbon as a function of\nneutrino energy. Few other results already published by the MINERvA and T2K\ncollaborations are also discussed.\n", "  We report ab initio excited-state dynamics simulations on isolated thymine to\ninvestigate the mechanism of intersystem crossing, based on CASSCF potential\nenergy surfaces and the \\textsc{Sharc} surface hopping method. We show that\neven though $S_2 \\rightarrow S_1$ internal conversion is not described\naccurately with CASSCF, intersystem crossing can be correctly simulated.\nIntersystem crossing in thymine occurs from the $S_1$ ($^1n\\pi^*$) minimum, via\na nearby crossing with $T_2$ ($^3\\pi\\pi^*$). The system further relaxes via\nultrafast internal conversion in the triplet manifold to the $T_1$\n($^3\\pi\\pi^*$) state. The simulations reveal that, once the system is trapped\nin the $^1n\\pi^*$ minimum, intersystem crossing might proceed with a time\nconstant of 1~ps. Furthermore, the change of the system's electronic state is\naccompanied respectively by elongation/shortening of specific bonds, which\ncould thus be used as indicators to identify which state is populated in the\ndynamics.\n", "  Overlaid self-ordering processes: we form anodic self-organized TiO2\nnanostumps and exploit them for self-ordering dewetting of Au-Ag sputtered\nfilms. This forms ordered particle configurations at tube top (crown position)\nor bottom (ground position). By dealloying we then form, from minimal amount of\nnoble metal, porous Au nanoparticles that when in crown position allow for a\ndrastically improved photocatalytic H2 production compared with nanoparticles\nproduced by conventional dewetting processes.\n", "  This article covers ten years of GRB follow-ups by the Spanish BOOTES\nstations: 71 follow-ups providing 23 detections. Follow-ups by BOOTES-1B from\n2005 to 2008 were given in the previous article, and are here reviewed,\nupdated, and include additional detection data points as the former article\nmerely stated their existence. The all-sky cameras CASSANDRA have not yet\ndetected any GRB optical afterglows, but limits are reported where available.\n", "  We review recent activity in the construction of the renormalization group\nfunctions for O(N) scalar and gauge theories in six and higher dimensions. The\ntheories lie in their respective universality classes at the Wilson-Fisher\nfixed point. The critical exponents at this fixed point in the various\ndimensions are all in agreement with the known exponents determined in the\nlarge Nexpansion.\n", "  We describe how a physical theory incorporating the properties of fields\nderiving from extra-dimensional structures over a four-dimensional spacetime\nmanifold can in principle be obtained through the analysis of a simple initial\nstructure consisting of the one dimension of time alone, as represented by the\nreal line. The simplicity of this starting point leads to symmetries of\nmulti-dimensional forms of time, from which a geometrical structure can be\nderived which is similar to the framework employed in non-Abelian Kaluza-Klein\ntheories. This leads to a relationship between the external and internal\ncurvature on the spacetime manifold unified through the underlying constraint\nof the one dimension of time for the theory presented here. We also describe\nhow the symmetry breaking structure is compatible with the Coleman-Mandula\ntheorem for the subsequent quantisation of the theory.\n", "  This is a chapter for an upcoming book, \"Space, Time, and the Limits of Human\nUnderstanding\", edited by Shyam Wuppuluri and Giancarlo Ghirardi. I first\npresent the classical picture of flat space and ever-flowing time, as generally\naccepted until about 1900, discuss the challenges posed by modern physics and\nthe adjustments required by special relativity, general relativity and quantum\nmechanics, and finally consider (and reject) a recent hypothesis that\nspace-time is essentially discrete. Ultimately, none of the simple answers to\n\"what is space-time?\" stand up to reality. We have more work ahead of us!\n", "  The fact that not all quantum observables are jointly measurable is one of\nthe major differences between quantum and classical theory. In the former,\nnon-commuting observables can only be simultaneously measured with limited\nprecision. We report on an experimental implementation of such a simultaneous\nmeasurement of two non-commuting observables based on the framework of weak von\nNeumann measurements. We use a photonic setup where the polarisation degree of\nfreedom acts as the system and the two components of the transversal position\ncorrespond to the pointers of the measurement apparatuses. In addition, the\ntheory shows that these weak measurements demonstrate a counter-intuitive\nnon-monotonicity: weaker measurements can potentially reveal more information\nthan stronger ones.\n", "  Acoustic-gravity waves (hereafter AGWs) in ocean have received much interest\nrecently, mainly with respect to early detection of tsunamis as they travel at\nnear the speed of sound in water which makes them ideal candidates for early\ndetection of tsunamis. While the generation mechanisms of AGWs have been\nstudied from the perspective of vertical oscillations of seafloor and triad\nwave-wave interaction, in the current study we are interested in their\ngeneration by wave-structure interaction with possible implication to the\nenergy sector. Here, we develop two wavemaker theories to analyze different\nwave modes generated by impermeable (the classic Havelock's theory) and porous\n(porous wavemaker theory) plates in weakly compressible fluids. Slight\nmodification has been made to the porous theory so that, unlike the previous\ntheory, the new solution depends on the geometry of the plate. The expressions\nfor three different types of plates (piston, flap, delta-function) are\nintroduced. Analytical solutions are also derived for the potential amplitude\nof the gravity, acoustic-gravity, evanescent waves, as well as the surface\nelevation, velocity distribution, and pressure for AGWs. Both theories reduce\nto previous results for incompressible flow when the compressibility is\nneglected. We also show numerical examples for AGWs generated in a wave flume\nas well as in deep ocean. Our current study sets the theoretical background\ntowards remote sensing by AGWs, for optimized deep ocean wave-power harnessing,\namong others.\n", "  The merits and limitations of the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model as a model for\nstrong interactions at nonzero density are critically discussed. We present\nseveral examples, demonstrating that, while in general the results should not\nbe trusted quantitatively, the NJL model is a powerful theoretical tool for\ngetting new insights and ideas about the QCD phase diagram and the dense-matter\nequation of state.\n", "  Ni$_{1-x}$Rh$_x$ bulk alloys exhibit a ferromagnetic to paramagnetic quantum\nphase transition (QPT) at the critical concentration $x_c \\sim$ 0.37. A spin\nglass phase arises below the Ferromagnetism by controlling the short range\ninteraction between Ni and Rh atoms. we have synthesized nanoalloys of two\ndifferent concentrations with two different reaction times by chemical reflux\nmethod. From the dc magnetization measurements, existence of ferromagnetism and\nspin glass phase in these nanoalloys is confirmed. A step like feature in both\nZFC and FC curve at certain temperature indicates the existence of the spin\nglass phase.\n", "  In supersymmetric models the mass of the stops can be considered as the\nnaturalness measure of the theory. Roughly, the lighter the stops are, the more\nnatural the theory is. Both, the absence of supersymmetric signals at\nexperiment and the measurement of the Higgs mass, put scenarios with light\nstops under increasing tension. I will present a supersymmetry breaking\nmechanism of the Scherk-Schwarz type that, by introducing extra $SU(2)_L$\ntriplets in the Higgs sector, is able to generate the correct Higgs mass while\nkeeping stops light.\n", "  The proposed $e^+e^-$-collider FCC-ee aims at an unprecedented accuracy for\n$e^+e^-$ collisions into fermion pairs at the $Z$ peak, based on about\n$10^{13}$ events. The S-matrix approach to the $Z$ boson line shape allows the\nmodel-independent quantitative description of the reaction $e^+e^- \\to {\\bar\nf}f$ around the $Z$ peak in terms of few parameters, among them the mass $M_Z$\nand width $\\Gamma_Z$ of the $Z$-boson. While weak and strong corrections remain\n\"black\", a careful theoretical description of the photonic interactions is\nmandatory. I introduce the method and describe applications and the analysis\ntool SMATASY/ZFITTER.\n", "  We present a retrieval algorithm based on generalized projections for\nultrashort pulse characterization using dispersion scan (d-scan). The new\nalgorithm is tested on several simulated cases and in two different\nexperimental cases in the few-cycle regime. The proposed algorithm is much\nfaster and leads to a drastic reduction of retrieval times, but performs less\nrobust in the retrieval of noisy d-scan traces compared to the standard\nalgorithm.\n", "  In the present work we report significant enhancement of the\nphotoelectrochemical properties of self-organized TiO2 nanotubes by a combined\nde-coring of classic nanotubes followed by an appropiate TiCl4-treatment. We\nshow that, except for the expected particle decoration, a key effect of the\nTiCl4 treatment is that the electron transport characteristics in TiO2\nnanotubes can be drastically improved, e.g. we observe an enhancement of up to\n70 % in electron transport times.\n", "  Over the past ten years, self-aligned TiO2 nanotubes have attracted\ntremendous scientific and technological interest due to their anticipated\nimpact on energy conversion, environment remediation and biocompatibility. In\nthe present manuscript, we review fundamental principles that govern the\nself-organized initiation of anodic TiO2 nanotubes. We start with the\nfundamental question: Why is self-organization taking place? We illustrate the\ninherent key mechanistic aspects that lead to tube growth in various different\nmorphologies, such as rippled-walled tubes, smooth tubes, stacks and\nbamboo-type tubes, and importantly the formation of double-walled TiO2\nnanotubes versus single-walled tubes, and the drastic difference in their\nphysical and chemical properties. We show how both double- and single-walled\ntube layers can be detached from the metallic substrate and exploited for the\npreparation of robust self-standing membranes. Finally, we show how by\nselecting the right growth approach to TiO2 nanotubes specific functional\nfeatures can be significantly improved, e.g., an enhanced electron mobility,\nintrinsic doping, or crystallization into pure anatase at extremely high\ntemperatures can be achieved. This in turn can be exploited in constructing\nhigh performance devices based on anodic TiO2 in a wide range of applications.\n", "  In this paper, we study theoretically the optomechanical interaction of an\nalmost pure condensate of photons with an oscillating mechanical membrane in a\nmicro-cavity. We show that in the Bogoliubov approximation, due to the large\nnumber of photons in the condensate phase, there is a linear strong effective\ncoupling between the Bogoliubov mode of the photonic Bose-Einstein condensate\n(BEC) and the mechanical motion of the membrane which depends on the nonlinear\nphoton-photon scattering potential. This coupling leads to the cooling of the\nmechanical motion, the normal mode splitting (NMS), the squeezing of the output\nfield and the entanglement between the excited mode of the cavity and the\nmechanical mode. We show that, in one hand, the nonlinearity of the photon gas\nincreases the degree of the squeezing of the output field of the micro-cavity\nand the efficiency of the cooling process at high temperatures. In the other\nhand, it reduces NMS in the displacement spectrum of the oscillating membrane\nand the degree of the optomechanical entanglement. In addition, the temperature\nof the photonic BEC can be used to control the above-mentioned phenomena.\n", "  Tree-level scattering amplitudes in massless theories not only exhibit a\nsimplicity entirely unexpected from Feynman diagrams, but also an underlying\nstructure remarkably reminiscent of worldsheet theory correlators. These\nfeatures can be explained by ambitwistor strings - two-dimensional chiral\nconformal field theories in an auxiliary target space, the complexified phase\nspace of null geodesics. The aim of this thesis is to explore the ambitwistor\nstring approach to understand these structures in amplitudes, and thereby\nprovide a new angle on quantum field theories. The first part of the thesis\nprovides a user-friendly introduction to ambitwistor strings, as well as a\ncondensed overview over the literature and some novel results. Emphasising the\nstudy of tree-level amplitudes, we then explore the wide-ranging impact of\nambitwistor strings for an extensive family of massless theories, and discuss\nthe duality between asymptotic symmetries and the low energy behaviour of a\ntheory from the point of view of the worldsheet CFT. The second part of this\nthesis focusses on proving a conjectured ambitwistor string formula for loop\namplitudes, and extending the formalism to more general theories. Remarkably,\nresidue theorems reduce the computationally challenging ambitwistor\nhigher-genus expressions to simple formulae on nodal Riemann spheres. This idea\nis developed into a widely applicable framework for loop integrands, that is\nshown to be applicable to both supersymmetric and non-supersymmetric theories.\nIn the case of supergravity, this provides strong evidence for the validity of\nthe ambitwistor string at loop level, and explicit proofs are given for\nnon-supersymmetric theories. This leads to a proposal for an all-loop integrand\nfor gravity and Yang-Mills.\n", "  We use free-standing TiO2 nanotube membranes that are transferred onto FTO\nslides in front-side illuminated dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). We\ninvestigate the key parameters for solar cell arrangement of self-ordered\nanodic TiO2 nanotube layers on the FTO substrate and namely the influence of\nthe annealing procedure on the DSSC light conversion efficiency. The results\nshow that using an optimal temperature annealing profile can significantly\nenhance the DSSC efficiency (in our case 9.8 %), as it leads to a markedly\nlower density of trapping states in the tube oxide, and thus to strongly\nimproved electron transport properties.\n", "  In this work we generalize the models for nonlinear waves in a gas--liquid\nmixture taking into account an interphase heat transfer, a surface tension and\na weak liquid compressibility simultaneously at the derivation of the equations\nfor nonlinear waves. We also take into consideration high order terms with\nrespect to the small parameter. Two new nonlinear differential equations are\nderived for long weakly nonlinear waves in a liquid with gas bubbles by the\nreductive perturbation method considering both high order terms with respect to\nthe small parameter and the above mentioned physical properties. One of these\nequations is the perturbation of the Burgers equation and corresponds to main\ninfluence of dissipation on nonlinear waves propagation. The other equation is\nthe perturbation of the Burgers--Korteweg--de Vries equation and corresponds to\nmain influence of dispersion on nonlinear waves propagation.\n", "  We conjecture that all vacua in string theory decay. More precisely,\nnon-supersymmetric vacua in string theory are at most metastable and eventually\ndecay, while supersymmetric vacua are only marginally stable. All de Sitter\nvacua with small cosmological constant are metastable to decay via a process\nthat occurs on scales small compared to the horizon size.\n", "  This thesis discusses the possibility of uncertainty relations for space and\nenergy given a state of fixed entropy. In particular, it discusses the results\nin the paper of Dam/Nguyen. There, the authors propose a lower bound for the\nmixed cost in energy and space required for physically storing information in a\nquantum mechanical system. We first critically examine the justifications for\nthe bound given in the paper.This is done from a mathematical point of view, in\ncontrast to the more physically motivated original paper.Then we give two\nexamples that illustrate the limitations of this inequality. We also present\nnumerical results to find an alternative energy-space bound in the finite\ndimensional version of this problem. They indicate a slightly different version\nof the inequality. In the end we describe a promising ansatz to find a lower\nenergy-space bound that depends on the amount stored information. Unfortunately\nthat did not result in a satisfactory result.\n", "  The nucleon axial form factor is a dominant contribution to errors in\nneutrino oscillation studies. Lattice QCD calculations can help control theory\nerrors by providing first-principles information on nucleon form factors. In\nthese proceedings, we present preliminary results on a blinded calculation of\n$g_A$ and the axial form factor using HISQ staggered baryons with 2+1+1 flavors\nof sea quarks. Calculations are done using physical light quark masses and are\nabsolutely normalized. We discuss fitting form factor data with the\nmodel-independent $z$ expansion parametrization.\n", "  It is useful to study the space of all cosmological models from a dynamical\nsystems perspective, that is, by formulating the Einstein field equations as a\ndynamical system using appropriately normalized variables. We will discuss\nvarious aspects of this work, the choices of normalization factor, multiple\nrepresentations of models, the past attractor, nonlinear dynamics in\nclose-to-Friedmann-Lemaitre models, Weyl curvature dominance, and numerical\nsimulations.\n", "  We discuss three complementary aspects of scalar curvature singularities:\nasymptotic causal properties, asymptotic Ricci and Weyl curvature, and\nasymptotic spatial properties. We divide scalar curvature singularities into\ntwo classes: so-called asymptotically silent singularities and non-generic\nsingularities that break asymptotic silence. The emphasis in this paper is on\nthe latter class which have not been previously discussed. We illustrate the\nabove aspects and concepts by describing the singularities of a number of\nrepresentative explicit perfect fluid solutions.\n"]}
