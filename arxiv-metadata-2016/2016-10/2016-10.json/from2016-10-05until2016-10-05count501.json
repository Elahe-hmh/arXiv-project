information\nprocessing. It is known that one can engineer the couplings of a\none-dimensional spin chain to achieve the goal of perfect state transfer. To\nleverage the value of these spin chains, a spin star is potentially useful for\nconnecting different parts of a quantum network. In this work, we extend the\nspin-chain engineering problem to the problems with a topology of a star\nnetwork. We show that a permanently coupled spin star can function as a network\nswitch for transferring quantum states selectively from one node to another by\nvarying the local potentials only. Together with one-dimensional chains, this\nresult allows applications of quantum state transfer be applied to more general\nquantum networks.\n", "  We present the first observation of the 1s2p 3P2 ? 1s2s 3S1 transition in\nHe-like uranium. The experiment was performed at the internal gas-jet target of\nthe ESR storage ring at GSI exploiting a Bragg crystal spectrometer and a\ngermanium solid state detector. Using the 1s2 2p 2P3/2 ? 1s2 2s 2S1/2\ntransition in Li-like uranium as reference and the deceleration capabilities of\nthe ESR storage rings, we obtained the first evaluation of the He-like heavy\nion intra-shell transition energy.\n", "  The ARCADE 2 instrument has measured the absolute temperature of the sky at\nfrequencies 3, 8, 10, 30, and 90 GHz, using an open-aperture cryogenic\ninstrument observing at balloon altitudes with no emissive windows between the\nbeam-forming optics and the sky. An external blackbody calibrator provides an\n{\\it in situ} reference. Systematic errors were greatly reduced by using\ndifferential radiometers and cooling all critical components to physical\ntemperatures approximating the CMB temperature. A linear model is used to\ncompare the output of each radiometer to a set of thermometers on the\ninstrument. Small corrections are made for the residual emission from the\nflight train, balloon, atmosphere, and foreground Galactic emission. The ARCADE\n2 data alone show an extragalactic rise of $50\\pm7$ mK at 3.3 GHz in addition\nto a CMB temperature of $2.730\\pm .004$ K. Combining the ARCADE 2 data with\ndata from the literature shows a background power law spectrum of $T=1.26\\pm\n0.09$ [K] $(\\nu/\\nu_0)^{-2.60\\pm 0.04}$ from 22 MHz to 10 GHz ($\\nu_0=1$ GHz)\nin addition to a CMB temperature of $2.725\\pm .001$ K.\n", "  We present new high resolution numerical simulations of the ISM in a central\nR ~32 parsecs region around a supermassive black hole at a galactic center.\nThree-dimensional hydrodynamic modeling of the ISM (Wada & Norman 2002) with\nthe nuclear starburst now includes tracking of the formation of molecular\nhydrogen out of the neutral hydrogen phase. In a quasi equilibrium state, mass\nfraction of H2 is about 0.4 (total H2 mass is ~1.5 10^6 Msun) of the total gas\nmass for the uniform far UV (FUV) with G_0 = 10. The gas forms an inhomogeneous\ndisk, whose scale-height becomes larger in the outer region. H2 forms a thin\nnuclear disk in the inner ~ 5 pc, which is surrounded by molecular clouds\nswelled up toward h < 10 pc. The velocity field of the disk is highly turbulent\nin the torus region, whose velocity dispersion is ~ 20 km/s on average. Average\nsupernova rate (SNR) of ~ 5 10^-5/yr is large enough to energize these\nstructures. Gas column densities toward the nucleus larger than 10^22 cm^-2 are\nobserved if the viewing angle is smaller than \\theta_v ~ 50 deg from the\nedge-on. However, the column densities are distributed over almost two orders\nof magnitude around the average for any given viewing angle due to the clumpy\nnature of the torus. For a stronger FUV (G_0 =100), the total H2 mass in an\nequillibrium is only slightly smaller (~ 0.35). Finally the morphology and\nkinematics of the circumnuclear molecular gas disks emerging from our models is\nsimilar to that revealed by recent near infrared observations using VLTI/Keck.\n", "  We study the vortex phase diagram of the single-layer Bi2Sr2CuO6+d (Bi2201)\nsuperconductor by means of bulk magnetization measurements on high-quality\noxygen-overdoped crystals. In striking contrast with the results found in the\nmoderately-doped two and three-layer Bi-based cuprates, Bi2201 exhibits a\nstrong temperature-dependent second-peak effect. By means of measurements of\nthe in and out-of-plane first-penetration field we provide direct evidence that\nthis phenomenon is mainly associated to an increase of the electromagnetic\nanisotropy on warming. The effect of oxygen-doping d on the vortex phase\ndiagram results in both the irreversibility and second-peak lines shifting to\nhigher temperatures and fields. This enhanced stability of the Bragg glass\nphase suggests that the interlayer coupling between Cu-O layers increases with\nd. In addition, we found that the critical temperature follows the parabolic\nrelation with the number of holes per Cu-O plane that holds for most single and\ntwo-layer cuprates.\n", "  We study transport properties and also local density of states in a clean\nsuperconductor-normal metal-superconductor Josephson junction with triplet\nf-wave superconductors based on the Eilenberger equation. Effects of thickness\nof normal metal and misorientation between gap vector of superconductors on the\nspin and charge currents are investigated. Spin current, which stems from the\nmisalignment of d-vectors, in the absence of charge current for some values of\nphase difference between superconductors is found. We also find unconventional\nbehavior of the spin current associated with 0-pitransition. The misalignment\nof d-vectors also gives rise to a zero energy peak in the density of states in\nthe normal metal.\n", "  Using a recently developed mesoscopic theory of protein dielectrics, we have\ncalculated the salt bridge energies, total residue electrostatic potential\nenergies, and transfer energies into a low dielectric amyloid-like phase for 12\nspecies and mutants of the prion protein. Salt bridges and self energies play\nkey roles in stabilizing secondary and tertiary structural elements of the\nprion protein. The total electrostatic potential energy of each residue was\nfound to be invariably stabilizing. Residues frequently found to be mutated in\nfamilial prion disease were among those with the largest electrostatic\nenergies. The large barrier to charged group desolvation imposes regional\nconstraints on involvement of the prion protein in an amyloid aggregate,\nresulting in an electrostatic amyloid recruitment profile that favours regions\nof sequence between alpha helix 1 and beta strand 2, the middles of helices 2\nand 3, and the region N-terminal to alpha helix 1. We found that the\nstabilization due to salt bridges is minimal among the proteins studied for\ndisease-susceptible human mutants of prion protein.\n", "  We show in elementary terms the equivalence in a general gauge of a\nU(1)-gauge theory of a scalar charged particle on a torus T^n = R^n/L to the\nanalogous theory on R^n constrained by quasiperiodicity under translations in\nthe lattice L. The latter theory provides a global description of the former:\nthe quasiperiodic wavefunctions defined on R^n play the role of sections of the\nassociated hermitean line bundle E on T^n, since also E admits a global\ndescription as a quotient. The components of the covariant derivatives\ncorresponding to a constant (necessarily integral) magnetic field B = dA\ngenerate a Lie algebra g_Q and together with the periodic functions the algebra\nof observables O_Q . The non-abelian part of g_Q is a Heisenberg Lie algebra\nwith the electric charge operator Q as the central generator; the corresponding\nLie group G_Q acts on the Hilbert space as the translation group up to phase\nfactors. Also the space of sections of E is mapped into itself by g in G_Q . We\nidentify the socalled magnetic translation group as a subgroup of the\nobservables' group Y_Q . We determine the unitary irreducible representations\nof O_Q, Y_Q corresponding to integer charges and for each of them an associated\northonormal basis explicitly in configuration space. We also clarify how in the\nn = 2m case a holomorphic structure and Theta functions arise on the associated\ncomplex torus. These results apply equally well to the physics of charged\nscalar particles on R^n and on T^n in the presence of periodic magnetic field B\nand scalar potential. They are also necessary preliminary steps for the\napplication to these theories of the deformation procedure induced by Drinfel'd\ntwists.\n", "  We present here a new solution for the astronomical computation of the\norbital motion of the Earth spanning from 0 to -250 Myr. The main improvement\nwith respect to the previous numerical solution La2004 (Laskar et al. 2004) is\nan improved adjustment of the parameters and initial conditions through a fit\nover 1 Myr to a special version of the high accurate numerical ephemeris\nINPOP08 (Fienga et al. 2009). The precession equations have also been entirely\nrevised and are no longer averaged over the orbital motion of the Earth and\nMoon. This new orbital solution is now valid over more than 50 Myr in the past\nor in the future with proper phases of the eccentricity variations. Due to\nchaotic behavior, the precision of the solution decreases rapidly beyond this\ntime span, and we discuss the behavior of various solutions beyond 50 Myr. For\npaleoclimate calibrations, we provide several different solutions that are all\ncompatible with the most precise planetary ephemeris. We have thus reached the\ntime where geological data are now required to discriminate among planetary\norbital solutions beyond 50 Myr.\n", "  Dwarf galaxies (DGs) serve as extremely challenging objects in extragalactic\nastrophysics. Their origin is expected to be set as the first units in CDM\ncosmology. Nevertheless they are the galaxy type most sensitive to\nenvironmental in uences and their division into multiple types with various\nproperties have invoked the picture of their variant morphological\ntransformations. Detailed observations reveal characteristics which allow to\ndeduce the evolutionary paths and to witness how the environment has affected\nthe evolution. Here we refer to general morphological DG types and review some\ngeneral processes, most of which deplete gas-rich irregular DGs. Moreover, the\nvariety of pecularities is brie y refered, but cannot be comprehensively\nanalyzed because of limited paper space.\n", "  We show that a quantum state transfer, previously studied as a continuous\ntime process in networks of interacting spins, can be achieved within the model\nof discrete time quantum walks with position dependent coin. We argue that due\nto additional degrees of freedom, discrete time quantum walks allow to observe\neffects which cannot be observed in the corresponding continuous time case.\nFirst, we study a discrete time version of the engineered coupling protocol due\nto Christandl et. al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 92, 187902 (2004)] and then discuss the\ngeneral idea of conversion between continuous time quantum walks and discrete\ntime quantum walks.\n", "  We have investigated the stability and conductivity of unsupported, two\ndimensional infinite gold nanowires using ab-initio density functional theory\n(DFT). Two dimensional ribbon like nanowires, with 1-5 rows of gold atoms in\nthe non-periodic direction and with different possible structures have been\nconsidered. The nanowires with > 2 rows of atoms exhibit dimerization, similar\nto finite wires, along the non-periodic direction. Our results show that in\nthese zero thickness nanowires, the parallelogram motif is the most stable. A\ncomparison between parallelogram and rectangular shaped nanowires of increasing\nwidth indicates that zero thickness (111) oriented wires have a higher\nstability over (100). A detailed analysis of the electronic structure, reveals\nthat the (111) oriented structures show increased delocalization of s and p\nelectrons in addition to a stronger delocalization of the d electrons and hence\nare the most stable. The density of states show that the nanowires are metallic\nand conducting except for the double zigzag structure, which, is\nsemiconducting. Conductance calculations show transmission for a wide range of\nenergies in all the stable nanowires with more than two rows of atoms. The\nconductance channels are not purely s and have strong contributions from the d\nlevels and weak contributions from the p levels.\n", "  In this brief report, the microcausility of quantum field theory on\nspin-induced noncom- mutative spacetime is discussed. It is found that for\nspacelike seperation the microcausality is not obeyed by the theory generally.\nIt means that Lorentz covariance can not guaran- tee microcausality in quantum\nfield thoery. We also give some comments about quantum field thoeries on such\nnoncommutative spacetime and the relations between noncommutative spacetime and\ncausality.\n", "  We have investigated theoretically the interaction between individual quantum\ndot with broken inversion symmetry and electromagnetic field of a single-mode\nquantum microcavity. It is shown that in the strong coupling regime the system\ndemonstrates nonlinear optical properties and can serve as emitter of the\nterahertz radiation at Rabi frequency of the system. Analytical results for\nsimplest physical situations are obtained and numerical quantum approach for\ncalculating emission spectrum is developed.\n", "  The wetting properties of solid substrates with macroscopic random roughness\nare considered as a function of the microscopic contact angle of the wetting\nliquid and its partial pressure in the surrounding gas phase. It is shown that\nWenzel prewetting, which has been recently predicted for a rather wide class of\nroughness profiles derived from Gaussian random processes by a general\ndistortion procedure, should in fact be ubiquitous and prevail under even much\nmilder conditions. The well-known transition occurring at Wenzel's angle is\naccompanied by a prewetting transition, at which a jump in the adsorbed liquid\nvolume occurs. This should be present on most surfaces bearing homogeneous,\nisotropic random roughness.\n", "  We study the topology and geometry of two dimensional coarsening foams with\narbitrary liquid fraction. To interpolate between the dry limit described by\nvon Neumann's law, and the wet limit described by Marqusee equation, the\nrelevant bubble characteristics are the Plateau border radius and a new\nvariable, the effective number of sides. We propose an equation for the\nindividual bubble growth rate as the weighted sum of the growth through\nbubble-bubble interfaces and through bubble-Plateau borders interfaces. The\nresulting prediction is successfully tested, without adjustable parameter,\nusing extensive bidimensional Potts model simulations. Simulations also show\nthat a selfsimilar growth regime is observed at any liquid fraction and\ndetermine how the average size growth exponent, side number distribution and\nrelative size distribution interpolate between the extreme limits. Applications\ninclude concentrated emulsions, grains in polycrystals and other domains with\ncoarsening driven by curvature.\n", "  We propose a conjecture to compute the all-order asymptotic expansion of the\ncolored Jones polynomial of the complement of a hyperbolic knot, J_N(q =\nexp(2u/N)) when N goes to infinity. Our conjecture claims that the asymptotic\nexpansion of the colored Jones polynomial is a the formal wave function of an\nintegrable system whose semiclassical spectral curve S would be the SL_2(C)\ncharacter variety of the knot (the A-polynomial), and is formulated in the\nframework of the topological recursion. It takes as starting point the proposal\nmade recently by Dijkgraaf, Fuji and Manabe (who kept only the perturbative\npart of the wave function, and found some discrepancies), but it also contains\nthe non-perturbative parts, and solves the discrepancy problem. These\nnon-perturbative corrections are derivatives of Theta functions associated to\nS, but the expansion is still in powers of 1/N due to the special properties of\nA-polynomials. We provide a detailed check for the figure-eight knot and the\nonce-punctured torus bundle L^2R. We also present a heuristic argument inspired\nfrom the case of torus knots, for which knot invariants can be computed from a\nmatrix model.\n", "  Scientific communities have adopted different conventions for ordering\nauthors on publications. Are these choices inconsequential, or do they have\nsignificant influence on individual authors, the quality of the projects\ncompleted, and research communities at large? What are the trade-offs of using\none convention over another? In order to investigate these questions, we\nformulate a basic two-player game theoretic model, which already illustrates\ninteresting phenomena that can occur in more realistic settings.\n  We find that alphabetical ordering can improve research quality, while\ncontribution-based ordering leads to a denser collaboration network and a\ngreater number of publications. Contrary to the assumption that free riding is\na weakness of the alphabetical ordering scheme, this phenomenon can occur under\nany contribution scheme, and the worst case occurs under contribution-based\nordering. Finally, we show how authors working on multiple projects can\ncooperate to attain optimal research quality and eliminate free riding given\neither contribution scheme.\n", "  We propose a novel class of atomic clocks based on highly charged ions. We\nconsider highly-forbidden laser-accessible transitions within the $4f^{12}$\nground-state configurations of highly charged ions. Our evaluation of\nsystematic effects demonstrates that these transitions may be used for building\nexceptionally accurate atomic clocks which may compete in accuracy with\nrecently proposed nuclear clock.\n", "  Within the collinear twist-3 framework, we study the single-spin asymmetry\n(SSA) in collisions between unpolarized protons and transversely polarized\nprotons with focus on the fragmentation term. The fragmentation mechanism must\nbe analyzed in detail in order to unambiguously determine the impact of various\ncontributions to SSAs in hadron production. Such a distinction may also settle\nthe \"sign mismatch\" between the transverse SSA in proton-proton collisions and\nthe Sivers effect in semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering. We calculate\nterms involving quark-quark and quark-gluon-quark correlators, which is an\nimportant step in such an investigation.\n", "  We consider the eigenvalue problem for the Laplace operator in a planar\ndomain which can be decomposed into a bounded domain of arbitrary shape and\nelongated \\branches\" of variable cross-sectional profiles. When the eigenvalue\nis smaller than a prescribed threshold, the corresponding eigenfunction decays\nexponentially along each branch. We prove this behavior for Robin boundary\ncondition and illustrate some related results by numerically computed\neigenfunctions.\n", "  We present an analytical closed form expression, which gives a good\napproximate propagator for diffusion on the sphere. Our formula is the\nspherical counterpart of the Gaussian propagator for diffusion on the plane.\nWhile the analytical formula is derived using saddle point methods for short\ntimes, it works well even for intermediate times. Our formula goes beyond\nconventional \"short time heat kernel expansions\" in that it is nonperturbative\nin the spatial coordinate, a feature that is ideal for studying large\ndeviations. Our work suggests a new and efficient algorithm for numerical\nintegration of the diffusion equation on a sphere. We perform Monte Carlo\nsimulations to compare the numerical efficiency of the new algorithm with the\nolder Gaussian one.\n", "  We investigate the creation of double K-shell holes in N2 molecules via\nsequential absorption of two photons on a timescale shorter than the core-hole\nlifetime by using intense x-ray pulses from the Linac Coherent Light Source\nfree electron laser. The production and decay of these states is characterized\nby photoelectron spectroscopy and Auger electron spectroscopy. In molecules,\ntwo types of double core holes are expected, the first with two core holes on\nthe same N atom, and the second with one core hole on each N atom. We report\nthe first direct observations of the former type of core hole in a molecule, in\ngood agreement with theory, and provide an experimental upper bound for the\nrelative contribution of the latter type.\n", "  We report on the realization of an out-of-equilibrium polariton condensate\nunder pulsed excitation in a one-dimensional geometry. We observe macroscopic\noccupation of a polaritonic mode with only 3% photonic fraction, and a nature\nstrikingly close to that of a bare exciton condensate. With the help of this\ntiny photonic fraction, the condensate is found to display first-order\ncoherence over distances as large as 10 microns. Based on a driven-dissipative\nmean field model, we find that the correlations length is limited by the\neffects of a shallow disorder under non-equilibrium conditions.\n", "  In this report we have pointed out that magnetic hysteresis loop can be used\nas a probe to distinguish a single layer from a many layer graphitic structure.\nChemically we have synthesized graphitic oxide (GO) and reduced graphitic oxide\n(RGO) for this investigation. We observe ferromagnetic like hysteresis loops\nfor both GO and RGO below a certain applied critical magnetic field and above\nthis critical field we observe cross-over of the positive magnetization to\nnegative magnetization leading to diamagnetic behaviour. This cross-over is\nmore dominant for the case of many layer graphitic structure. Upon annealing of\nGO in air the critical cross-over field decreases and the magnetization\nincreases for multilayer graphitic structure. Possible reasons for all these\nobservations and phenomena is presented here.\n", "  Context. Though only a handful of extrasolar planets have been discovered via\ndirect imaging, each of these discoveries had tremendous impact on our\nunderstanding of planetary formation, stellar formation and cool atmosphere\nphysics. Aims. Since many of these newly imaged giant planets orbit massive A\nor even B stars we investigated whether giant planets could be found orbiting\nlow-mass stars at large separations. Methods. We have been conducting an\nadaptive optic imaging survey to search for planetary-mass companions of young\nM dwarfs of the solar neigbourhood, to probe different initial conditions of\nplanetary formation. Results. We report here the direct imaging discovery of\n2MASS J01033563-5515561(AB)b, a 12-14 MJup companion at a projected separation\nof 84 AU from a pair of young late M stars, with which it shares proper motion.\nWe also detected a Keplerian-compatible orbital motion. Conclusions. This young\nL-type object at planet/brown dwarf mass boundary is the first ever imaged\naround a binary system at a separation compatible with formation in a disc.\n", "  We address the forces exerted by the electromagnetic field emitted by a\nplanar uctuating source on dielectric particles that have arose much interest\nbecause of their recently shown magnetodielectric behavior. In this context, we\nanalyze as a particular case the modification of the Casimir and Van der Waals\nforces. We study the effect of the source coherence length as well as the\ninterplay between the force from the radiated field and that from the electric\nand magnetic dipoles induced on the particle. This allows a control of these\ninteractions as well as of the weight and interference effects between the\nfields from both kinds of induced dipoles, in particular when large changes in\ntheir differential scattering cross section occur due to Kerker minimum forward\nor zero backward conditions; thus opening new paths to nanoparticle ensembling\nand manipulation. The influence of surface waves of the source is also studied.\n", "  The Coronal Multichannel Polarimeter (CoMP) measures not only the\npolarization of coronal emission, but also the full radiance profiles of\ncoronal emission lines. For the first time, CoMP observations provide\nhigh-cadence image sequences of the coronal line intensity, Doppler shift and\nline width simultaneously in a large field of view. By studying the Doppler\nshift and line width we may explore more of the physical processes of CME\ninitiation and propagation. Here we identify a list of CMEs observed by CoMP\nand present the first results of these observations. Our preliminary analysis\nshows that CMEs are usually associated with greatly increased Doppler shift and\nenhanced line width. These new observations provide not only valuable\ninformation to constrain CME models and probe various processes during the\ninitial propagation of CMEs in the low corona, but also offer a possible\ncost-effective and low-risk means of space weather monitoring.\n", "  This is the supplementary information to arXiv:1303.4545v1 [physics.optics]\n19 Mar 2013 in which we address the forces exerted by the electromagnetic field\nemitted by a planar uctuating source on dielectric particles that have arose\nmuch interest because of their recently shown magnetodielectric behavior.\n", "  We study the anomalous density in an ultra-cold trapped bose gas in a\nvariational framework, for both zero and finite temperature. We show that it is\nfinite in 1D, while it is logarithmically and linearly divergent in 2D and 3D.\nThe renormalization that we adopt is more reliable and compatible with the\nvariational scheme. The main outcome is that the anomalous and non condensate\ndensities are of the\n", "  We formulate a notion of abstract loop equations, and show that their\nsolution is provided by a topological recursion under some assumptions, in\nparticular the result takes a universal form. The Schwinger-Dyson equation of\nthe one and two hermitian matrix models, and of the O(n) model appear as\nspecial cases. We study applications to repulsive particles systems, and\nexplain how our notion of loop equations are related to Virasoro constraints.\nThen, as a special case, we study in detail applications to enumeration\nproblems in a general class of non-intersecting loop models on the random\nlattice of all topologies, to SU(N) Chern-Simons invariants of torus knots in\nthe large N expansion. We also mention an application to Liouville theory on\nsurfaces of positive genus.\n", "  In the paper, the model of the society represented by a social network and\nthe model of a multi-agent system built on the basis of this, is presented. The\nparticular aim of the system is to predict the evolution of a society and an\nanalysis of the communities that appear, their characteristic features and\nreasons for coming into being. As an example of application, an analysis was\nmade of a social portal which makes it possible to offer and reserve places in\nrooms for travelling tourists\n", "  In this work, a model to study the coupling between a semiconductor qubit and\ntwo timedependent electric fields is developed. By using it in the resonantly\nmonochromatic double dressing regime, control of the local density of optical\nstates is theoretically and numerically demonstrated for a strongly confined\nexciton. Drastic changes in the allowed energy transitions yielding tunable\nbroadening of the optically active frequency ranges, are observed in the\nsimulated emission spectra. The presented results are in excellent qualitative\nand quantitative agreement with recent experimental observations.\n", "  We introduce a new model of competition on growing networks. This extends the\npreferential attachment model, with the key property that node choices evolve\nsimultaneously with the network. When a new node joins the network, it chooses\nneighbours by preferential attachment, and selects its type based on the number\nof initial neighbours of each type. The model is analysed in detail, and in\nparticular, we determine the possible proportions of the various types in the\nlimit of large networks. An important qualitative feature we find is that, in\ncontrast to many current theoretical models, often several competitors will\ncoexist. This matches empirical observations in many real-world networks.\n", "  We show that the large N expansion in the multi-trace 1 formal hermitian\nmatrix model is governed by the topological recursion of [Eynard and Orantin,\n2007] with initial conditions. In terms of a 1d gas of eigenvalues, this model\nincludes - on top of the squared Vandermonde - multilinear interactions of any\norder between the eigenvalues. In this problem, the initial data (W10,W20) of\nthe topological recursion is characterized: for W10, by a non-linear, non-local\nRiemann-Hilbert problem on a discontinuity locus to determine ; for W20, by a\nrelated but linear, non-local Riemann-Hilbert problem on the discontinuity\nlocus. In combinatorics, this model enumerates discrete surfaces (maps) whose\nelementary 2-cells can have any topology - W10 being the generating series of\ndisks and W20 that of cylinders. In particular, by substitution one may\nconsider maps whose elementary cells are themselves maps, for which we propose\nthe name \"stuffed maps\". In a sense, our results complete the program of the\n\"moment method\" initiated in the 90s to compute the formal 1/N in the one\nhermitian matrix model.\n", "  A Friedman cosmology is investigated based on scalar-tensor gravitation with\ngeneral metric coupling and scalar potential functions. We show that for a\nbroad class of such functions, the scalar field can be dynamically trapped\nusing a recently suggested mechanism. The trapped scalar can drive inflation\nand accelerated cosmic expansion, compatible with standard requirements. The\ninflationary phase admits a natural exit with a value of the Hubble parameter\ndictated by the duration of inflation in a parameter independent manner. For\ninflationary duration consistent with the GUT description, the resulting Hubble\nparameter is found to be consistent with its observed value.\n", "  We perform a geometric analysis for the sky map of the IceCube TeV-PeV\nneutrino excess and test its compatibility with the sky map of decaying dark\nmatter signals in our galaxy. Using both Kolmogorov-Smirnov and the\nlikelihood-ratio tests, we have found that the observed event sky map prefers\nto have a combination of the galactic dark matter and a homogeneous background\ncontributions, compared to a purely galactic dark matter origin. For the\nassumption that the galactic dark matter is responsible for all neutrino\nexcess, the current data can also exclude a wide range of dark matter profiles\nexcept flatter profiles such as the isothermal one. We also consider several\nrepresentative decaying dark matter spectra, which can provide a good fit to\nthe observed spectrum at IceCube with a dark matter lifetime of around 12\norders of magnitude longer than the age of the universe.\n", "  We describe a method for measuring the integrated Comptonization (YSZ) of\nclusters of galaxies from measurements of the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect in\nmultiple frequency bands and use this method to characterize a sample of galaxy\nclusters detected in South Pole Telescope (SPT) data. We test this method on\nsimulated cluster observations and verify that it can accurately recover\ncluster parameters with negligible bias. In realistic simulations of an\nSPT-like survey, with realizations of cosmic microwave background anisotropy,\npoint sources, and atmosphere and instrumental noise at typical SPT-SZ survey\nlevels, we find that YSZ is most accurately determined in an aperture\ncomparable to the SPT beam size. We demonstrate the utility of this method to\nmeasure YSZ and to constrain mass scaling relations using X-ray mass estimates\nfor a sample of 18 galaxy clusters from the SPT-SZ survey. Measuring YSZ within\na 0.75' radius aperture, we find an intrinsic log-normal scatter of 21+/-11% in\nYSZ at a fixed mass. Measuring YSZ within a 0.3 Mpc projected radius\n(equivalent to 0.75' at the survey median redshift z = 0.6), we find a scatter\nof 26+/-9%. Prior to this study, the SPT observable found to have the lowest\nscatter with mass was cluster detection significance. We demonstrate, from both\nsimulations and SPT observed clusters, that YSZ measured within an aperture\ncomparable to the SPT beam size is equivalent, in terms of scatter with cluster\nmass, to SPT cluster detection significance.\n", "  We calculate the potential energy curves, the permanent dipole moment curves,\nand the lifetimes of the ground and excited vibrational states of the\nheteronuclear alkali dimers XY (X, Y = Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs) in the X1{\\Sigma}+\nelectronic state using the coupled cluster with singles doubles and triples\n(CCSDT) method. All-electron quadruple-{\\zeta} basis sets with additional core\nfunctions are used for Li and Na, and small-core relativistic effective core\npotentials with quadruple-{\\zeta} quality basis sets are used for K, Rb and Cs.\nThe inclusion of the coupled cluster non-perturbative triple excitations is\nshown to be crucial for obtaining the accurate potential energy curves. Large\none-electron basis set with additional core functions is needed for the\naccurate prediction of permanent dipole moments. The dissociation energies are\noverestimated by only 14 cm-1 for LiNa and by no more than 114 cm-1 for the\nother molecules. The discrepancies between the experimental and calculated\nharmonic vibrational frequencies are less than 1.7 cm-1, and the discrepancies\nfor the anharmonic correction are less than 0.1 cm-1. We show that correlation\nbetween atomic electronegativity differences and permanent dipole moment of\nheteronuclear alkali dimers is not perfect. To obtain the vibrational energies\nand wave functions the vibrational Schr\\\"odinger equation is solved with the\nB-spline basis set method. The transition dipole moments between all\nvibrational states, the Einstein coefficients and the lifetimes of the\nvibrational states are calculated. We analyze the decay rates of the\nvibrational states in terms of spontaneous emission, and stimulated emission\nand absorption induced by black body radiation. In all studied heteronuclear\nalkali dimers the ground vibrational states have much longer lifetimes than any\nexcited states.\n", "  We investigated the Li+ ion incorporation in Ba2GdNbO6:Eu3+ perovskite by\natomistic simulations based on energy minimization. We predicted the most\nprobable sites occupied by Eu3+ and Li+ ions and the related\ncharge-compensation mechanisms involved into these substitutions. The results\nshow that the Eu3+ and Li+ ions are incorporated mainly at the Gd3+ site. In\nthe Li+ ion case, there is a charge compensation by Nb_Gd antisite. The Crystal\nfield parameters and the transition levels for the Eu3+ ion in the BGN:Eu3+\nwere calculated with basis on the simulated local symmetry of the Eu3+ site.\nThe results show that the mechanism of luminescent properties enhancement is\nthe symmetry distortion induced by the Li+ co-doping.\n", "  We theoretically investigate the surface plasmon polariton (SPP) at the\ninterface between 3D strong topological insulator (TI) and layered\nsuperconductor-magnetic insulator structure. The tunability of SPP through\nelectronic doping can be enhanced when the magnetic permeability of the layered\nstructure becomes higher. When the interface is gapped by superconductivity or\nperpendicular magnetism, SPP dispersion is further distorted, accompanied by a\nshift of group velocity and penetration depth. Such a shift of SPP reaches\nmaximum when the magnitude of Fermi level approaches the gap value, and may\nlead to observable effects. The tunable SPP at the interface between layered\nsuperconductor and magnetism materials in proximity to TI surface may provide\nnew insight in the detection of Majorana Fermions.\n", "  A well known cryptographic primitive is so called random access code. Namely,\nAlice is to send to Bob one of two bits, so that Bob has the choice which bit\nhe wants to learn about. However at any time Alice should not learn Bob's\nchoice, and Bob should learn only the bit of his choice. The task is impossible\nto accomplish by means of either classical or quantum communication. On the\nother hand, a concept of correlations stronger than quantum ones, exhibited by\nso called Popescu- Rohrlich box, was introduced and widely studied. In\nparticular, it is known that Popescu-Rohrlich box enables simulation of the\nrandom access code with the support of one bit of communication. Here, we\npropose a quantum analogue of this phenomenon. Namely, we define an analogue of\na random access code, where instead of classical bits, one encodes qubits. We\nprovide a quantum non-signaling box that if supported with two classical bits,\nallows to simulate a quantum version of random access code. We point out that\ntwo bits are necessary. We also show that a quantum random access code cannot\nbe fully quantum: when Bob inputs superposition of two choices, the output will\nbe in a mixed state rather than in a superposition of required states.\n", "  Triply resonant three mode interactions in long optical cavities have been\nshown to lead to enhanced scattering of carrier light by the ultrasonic\nacoustic modes of the test mass mirrors. At high optical power, this can lead\nto parametric instability (parametric gain R > 1) for a few acoustic modes with\nstrong spectral and spatial overlap. Numerous ?~10^3 acoustic modes of the test\nmasses are predicted to have R > 10^2. Experimental studies have shown that\nsuch modes also strongly scatter the carrier light, enabling very sensitive\nreadout of the acoustic modes. The 3-mode scattering from the thermal\nfluctuation of large population of ultrasonic modes would causes random changes\nin occupation number of the carrier light and cavity transverse optical modes.\nBecause the thermal fluctuation time scale (set by the acoustic mode relaxation\ntimes) is typically a few seconds, the noise spectrum from thermally induced\nphoton number fluctuations is strongly peaked at low frequency. The noise level\ndepends on the acoustic mode structure and acoustic losses of the test masses,\nthe transverse optical mode spectrum of the optical cavities and on the test\nmass temperature. We theoretically investigate the possible effect of this\nnoise and show that in advanced detectors under construction three mode\ninteraction noise is below the standard quantum limit, but could set limits on\nfuture low frequency detectors that aim to exceed the free mass standard\nquantum limit.\n", "  We consider an alternative approach for the computation of the stochastic\ngravitational wave background generated by small loops produced throughout the\ncosmological evolution of cosmic string networks and use it to derive an\nanalytical approximation to the corresponding power spectrum. We show that this\napproximation produces an excellent fit to more elaborate results obtained\nusing the Velocity-dependent One-Scale model to describe cosmic string network\ndynamics, over a wide frequency range, in the small-loop regime.\n", "  In this paper we discuss the energy interaction between gravitational waves\nand laser interferom- eter gravitational wave detectors. We show that the\nwidely held view that the laser interferometer gravitational wave detector\nabsorbs no energy from gravitational waves is only valid under the\napproximation of a frequency-independent optomechanical coupling strength and a\npump laser without detuning with respect to the resonance of the\ninterferometer. For a strongly detuned interferometer, the optical-damping\ndynamics dissipates gravitational wave energy through the interaction between\nthe test masses and the optical field. For a non-detuned interferometer, the\nfrequency-dependence of the optomechanical coupling strength causes a tiny\nenergy dissipation, which is proved to be equivalent to the Doppler friction\nraised by Braginsky et.al.\n", "  Threshold cascade models have been used to describe spread of behavior in\nsocial networks and cascades of default in financial networks. In some cases,\nthese networks may have multiple kinds of interactions, such as distinct types\nof social ties or distinct types of financial liabilities; furthermore, nodes\nmay respond in different ways to in influence from their neighbors of multiple\ntypes. To start to capture such settings in a stylized way, we generalize a\nthreshold cascade model to a multiplex network in which nodes follow one of two\nresponse rules: some nodes activate when, in at least one layer, a large enough\nfraction of neighbors are active, while the other nodes activate when, in all\nlayers, a large enough fraction of neighbors are active. Varying the fractions\nof nodes following either rule facilitates or inhibits cascades. Near the\ninhibition regime, global cascades appear discontinuously as the network\ndensity increases; however, the cascade grows more slowly over time. This\nbehavior suggests a way in which various collective phenomena in the real world\ncould appear abruptly yet slowly.\n", "  We demonstrate sensitive detection of single charges using a planar tunnel\njunction 8.5nm wide and 17.2nm long defined by an atomically precise phosphorus\ndoping profile in silicon. The conductance of the junction responds to a nearby\ngate potential and also to changes in the charge state of a quantum dot\npatterned 52nm away. The response of this detector is monotonic across the\nentire working voltage range of the device, which will make it particularly\nuseful for studying systems of multiple quantum dots. The charge sensitivity is\nmaximized when the junction is most conductive, suggesting that more sensitive\ndetection can be achieved by shortening the length of the junction to increase\nits conductance.\n", "  We formulate and solve the Slepian spatial-spectral concentration problem on\nthe three-dimensional ball. Both the standard Fourier-Bessel and also the\nFourier-Laguerre spectral domains are considered since the latter exhibits a\nnumber of practical advantages (spectral decoupling and exact computation). The\nSlepian spatial and spectral concentration problems are formulated as\neigenvalue problems, the eigenfunctions of which form an orthogonal family of\nconcentrated functions. Equivalence between the spatial and spectral problems\nis shown. The spherical Shannon number on the ball is derived, which acts as\nthe analog of the space-bandwidth product in the Euclidean setting, giving an\nestimate of the number of concentrated eigenfunctions and thus the dimension of\nthe space of functions that can be concentrated in both the spatial and\nspectral domains simultaneously. Various symmetries of the spatial region are\nconsidered that reduce considerably the computational burden of recovering\neigenfunctions, either by decoupling the problem into smaller subproblems or by\naffording analytic calculations. The family of concentrated eigenfunctions\nforms a Slepian basis that can be used be represent concentrated signals\nefficiently. We illustrate our results with numerical examples and show that\nthe Slepian basis indeeds permits a sparse representation of concentrated\nsignals.\n", "  In this work, we investigate the synchronization in oscillators with\nconjugate coupling in which oscillators interact via dissimilar variables. The\nsynchronous dynamics and its stability are investigated theoretically and\nnumerically. We find that the synchronous dynamics and its stability are\ndependent on both coupling scheme and the coupling constant. We also find that\nthe synchronization may be independent of the number of oscillators. Numerical\ndemonstrations with Lorenz oscillators are provided.\n", "  It is generally accepted that certain astronomical and cosmological\nobservations can be explained by invoking the concepts of Dark Matter and Dark\nEnergy (DM/DE). Applying straightforward extensions of the Standard Model to\nDM/DE, results in scalar fields and predictions of particles generation via\nphoto-magnetic coupling . Under the right conditions, these particles should be\nobservable in earth-bound laboratory settings. Although many attempts have been\nmade to observe these particles, none have succeeded.\n  Heretofore, most searches have focused on detecting multi-GeV Dark Matter\nWIMPS. Recently, however, searches have been conducted in the lighter dark\nmatter, sub-eV, WISP mass range. By comparison, little has been done to search\nfor dark energy particles. The ALPs-Chameleon Experiments Stations (ACES)\nprogram, described herein, proposes a compact station that would search for\nboth dark sector particles.\n  Finally, it is noted that both \"species\" of particles - dark energy and dark\nmatter - could be generated at the same time in the same magnetic field with\nthe possibility of interaction between DM and DE particles. Thus, by using\nstandard matter tools to produce particles from both dark sectors, ACES\npotentially could provide tri-sector discoveries with huge results for very\nlittle investment.\n", "  The ability to carry electric current with zero dissipation is the hallmark\nof superconductivity. It is this very property which is used in applications\nfrom MRI machines to LHC magnets. But, is it indeed the case that\nsuperconducting order is incompatible with dissipation? One notable exception,\nknown as vortex flow, takes place in high magnetic fields. Here we report\nobservation of dissipative superconductivity in far more basic configurations:\nsuperconducting nanowires with superconducting leads. We provide evidence that\nin such systems, normal current may flow in the presence of superconducting\norder throughout the wire. The phenomenon is attributed to the formation of a\nnon-equilibrium state, where superconductivity coexists with dissipation,\nmediated by the so-called Andreev quasiparticles. Besides promise for\napplications such as single-photon detectors, the effect is a vivid example of\na controllable non-equilibrium state of a quantum liquid. Thus our findings\nprovide an accessible generic platform to investigate conceptual problems of\nout-of-equilibrium quantum systems.\n", "  Collective behaviors of coupled oscillators have attracted much attention. In\nthis Letter, we propose an ensemble order parameter(EOP) equation that enables\nus to grasp the essential low-dimensional dynamical mechanism of the explosive\nsynchronization in heterogeneous networks. Dif- ferent solutions of the EOP\nequation build correspondences with diverse collective states, and different\nbifurcations reveal various transitions among these collective states. The\nstructural relationship between the incoherent state and synchronous state\nleads to different routes of transitions to synchronization, either continuous\nor discontinuous. The explosive synchronization is determined by the bistable\nstate where the measure of each state and the critical points are obtained\nanalytically by using the EOP equation. Our method and results hold for\nheterogeneous networks with star graph motifs such as scale-free networks, and\nhence, provide an effective approach in understanding the routes to\nsynchronization in more general complex networks.\n", "  We carry out molecular dynamics (MD) and Monte Carlo (MC) simulations to\ncharacterize nucleation in liquid clusters of 600 Lennard-Jones particles over\na broad range of temperatures. We use the formalism of mean first-passage times\nto determine the rate and find that Classical Nucleation Theory (CNT) predicts\nthe rate quite well, even when employing simple modelling of crystallite shape,\nchemical potential, surface tension and particle attachment rate, down to the\ntemperature where the droplet loses metastability and crystallization proceeds\nthrough growth-limited nucleation in an unequilibrated liquid. Below this\ncrossover temperature, the nucleation rate is still predicted when MC\nsimulations are used to directly calculate quantities required by CNT.\nDiscrepancy in critical embryo sizes obtained from MD and MC arises when\ntwinned structures with five-fold symmetry provide a competing free energy\npathway out of the critical region. We find that crystallization begins with\nhcp-fcc stacked precritical nuclei and differentiation to various end\nstructures occurs when these embryos become critical. We confirm that using the\nlargest embryo in the system as a reaction coordinate is useful in determining\nthe onset of growth-limited nucleation and show that it gives the same free\nenergy barriers as the full cluster size distribution once the proper reference\nstate is identified. We find that the bulk melting temperature controls the\nrate, even though the solid-liquid coexistence temperature for the droplet is\nsignificantly lower. The value of surface tension that renders close agreement\nbetween CNT and direct rate determination is significantly lower than what is\nexpected for the bulk system.\n", "  The basic concepts of orbital entanglement and its application to chemistry\nare briefly reviewed. The calculation of orbital entanglement measures from\ncorrelated wavefunctions is discussed in terms of reduced $n$-particle density\nmatrices. Possible simplifications in their evaluation are highlighted in case\nof seniority-zero wavefunctions. Specifically, orbital entanglement allows us\nto dissect electron correlation effects in its strong and weak contributions,\nto determine bond orders, to assess the quality and stability of active space\ncalculations, to monitor chemical reactions, and to identify points along the\nreaction coordinate where electronic wavefunctions change drastically. Thus,\norbital entanglement represents a useful and intuitive tool to interpret\ncomplex electronic wavefunctions and to facilitate a qualitative understanding\nof electronic structure and how it changes in chemical processes.\n", "  Postulating the existence of a fnite-mass mediator of T,P-odd coupling\nbetween atomic electrons and nucleons we consider its effect on permanent\nelectric dipole moment (EDM) of diamagnetic atoms. We present both numerical\nand analytical analysis for such mediator-induced EDMs and compare it with EDM\nresults for the conventional contact interaction. Based on this analysis we\nderive limits on coupling strengths and carrier masses from experimental limits\non EDM of 199Hg atom.\n", "  Emergent behaviors occur in a vast array of systems across many scales, and\nare of fundamental physical importance because of the intrinsic difficulty in\nlinking microscopic system properties to macroscopic behaviors. Here we study\nthe emergent self-assembly behavior of model systems of recently synthesized\nfamilies of concave dimpled hard spheres, or lock-and-key colloids. We find\nthat as dimple size increases each family exhibits a crossover from a structure\nthat does not reflect the particle symmetry to one that does and, surprisingly,\nthe point at which this crossover occurs is approximately independent of the\nparticle symmetry. Using a combination of numerical and analytic techniques we\nstudy systems at infinite and finite pressure, and find different common\ncontrol parameters in each limit. Our results suggest there exists a set of\nexperimentally realizable colloidal systems that exhibit complex emergent\nbehaviors that can be traced to a common underlying microscopic control\nparameter.\n", "  Level-rank duality relates the observables of two different Chern-Simons\ntheories in which the roles of the Chern-Simons level and the rank of the gauge\ngroup are exchanged. In this note, we explore the consequences of this duality\nin the realm of topological string theory. We show that this duality induces a\nnumber of identities between the open Gromov-Witten invariants of the\ngeometries associated with a knot ${\\cal K}$ and its mirror image $\\tilde{\\cal\nK}$. We show how these identities arise both in the A-model and in the dual\nB-model.\n", "  We propose a scheme based on a heterodyne laser link that allows for long\nbaseline gravitational wave detection using atom interferometry. While the\nbaseline length in previous atom-based proposals is constrained by the need for\na reference laser to remain collimated as it propagates between two satellites,\nhere we circumvent this requirement by employing a strong local oscillator\nlaser near each atom ensemble that is phase locked to the reference laser beam.\nLonger baselines offer a number of potential advantages, including enhanced\nsensitivity, simplified atom optics, and reduced atomic source flux\nrequirements.\n", "  Large-scale peculiar motion modulates the observed luminosity distribution of\ngalaxies. Using about half a million SDSS galaxies, this can be harnessed to\nobtain bounds on peculiar velocity moments, the amplitude of the linear matter\npower spectrum, $\\sigma_{8}$, and the growth rate of density perturbations at z\n~ 0.1. Results obtained from this approach agree well with the predictions of\nthe $\\Lambda$CDM model and are consistent with the reported ~ 1% zero-point\ntilt in the SDSS photometry.\n", "  We have observed thermal gating, i.e. electrostatic gating induced by hot\nelectrons. The effect occurs in a device consisting of two capacitively coupled\nquantum dots. The double dot system is coupled to a hot electron reservoir on\none side (QD1), whilst the conductance of the second dot (QD2) is monitored.\nWhen a bias across QD2 is applied we observe a current which is strongly\ndependent on the temperature of the heat reservoir. This current can be either\nenhanced or suppressed, depending on the relative energetic alignment of the QD\nlevels. Thus, the system can be used to control a charge current by hot\nelectrons.\n", "  In this paper, we prove a far-from-CMC result similar to the ones obtained by\nHolst, Nagy, Tsogtgerel and Maxwell for the conformal Einstein-scalar field\nconstraint equations on compact Riemannian manifolds with positive (modified)\nYamabe invariant.\n", "  Beginning with the principle that a closed mechanical composite system is\ntimeless, time can be defined by the regular changes in a suitable position\ncoordinate (clock) in the observing part, when one part of the closed composite\nobserves another part. Translating this scenario into both classical and\nquantum mechanics allows a transition to be made from a time-independent\nmechanics for the closed composite to a time-dependent description of the\nobserved part alone. The use of Hamilton- Jacobi theory yields a very close\nparallel between the derivations in classical and quantum mechanics. The\ntime-dependent equations, Hamilton-Jacobi or Schr\u007fodinger, appear as\napproximations since no observed system is truly closed. The quantum case has\nan additional feature in the condition that the observing environment must\nbecome classical in order to define a real classical time variable. This\ncondition leads to a removal of entanglement engendered by the interaction\nbetween the observed system and the observing environment. Comparison is made\nto the similar emergence of time in quantum gravity theory\n", "  We propose a generalized star product which deviates from the standard\nproduct when the fields at evaluated at different space-time points. This\nproduces no changes in the standard Lagrangian density in non-commutative\nspace-time but produces a change in the cosmological power spectrum. We show\nthat the generalized star product leads to physically consistent results and\ncan fit the observed data on hemispherical anisotropy in the cosmic microwave\nbackground radiation.\n", "  Thermodynamics is independent of a description at a microscopic level\nconsequently statistical thermodynamics must produce results independent of the\ncoordinate system used to describe the particles and their interactions. In the\npath integral formalism the equilibrium properties are cal- culated by using\nclosed paths and an euclidean coordinate system. We show that the calculations\non these paths are coordinates independent. In the change of coordinate systems\nwe consider those preserving the physics on which we focus. Recently it has\nbeen shown that the path integral formalism can be built from the real motion\nof particles. We consider the change of coordinates for which the equations of\nmotion are unchanged. Thus we have to deal with the canonical trans-\nformations. The Lagrangian is not uniquely defined and a change of coordinates\nintroduces in hamiltonians the partial time derivative of an arbitrary\nfunction. We have show that the closed paths does not contain any arbitrary\ningredients. This proof is inspired by a method used in gauge theory. Closed\npaths appear as the keystone on which we may describe the equilibrium states in\nstatistical thermodynamics.\n", "  We consider an special dynamics of a quantum walk (QW) on a line. Initially,\nthe walker localized at the origin of the line with arbitrary chirality,\nevolves to an asymptotic stationary state. In this stationary state a\nmeasurement is performed and the state resulting from this measurement is used\nto start a second QW evolution to achieve a second asymptotic stationary state.\nIn previous works, we developed the thermodynamics associated with the\nentanglement between the coin and position degrees of freedom in the QW. Here\nwe study the application of the first and second laws of thermodynamics to the\nprocess between the two stationary states mentioned above. We show that: i) the\nentropy change has upper and lower bounds that are obtained analytically as a\nfunction of the initial conditions. ii) the energy change is associated to a\nheat-transfer process.\n", "  Despite decades of progress, an understanding of unconventional\nsuperconductivity still remains elusive. An important open question is about\nthe material dependence of the superconducting properties. Using the\nquasiparticle self-consistent GW method, we re-examine the electronic structure\nof copper oxide high-Tc materials. We show that QSGW captures several important\nfeatures, distinctive from the conventional LDA results. The energy level\nsplitting between dx2-y2 and d3z2-r2 is significantly enlarged and the van Hove\nsingularity point is lowered. The calculated results compare better than LDA\nwith recent experimental results from resonant inelastic xray scattering and\nangle resolved photoemission experiments. This agreement with the experiments\nsupports the previously suggested two-band theory for the material dependence\nof the superconducting transition temperature, Tc.\n", "  The trial and condemnation of Giordano Bruno was mainly based on arguments of\nphilosophical and theological nature, and therefore different from Galilei's.\nSuch elements contribute to unfairly devalue the scientific contribution of\nBruno and do not properly account in particular for his contribution to\nphysics. This paper discusses the contribution of Bruno to the principle of\nrelativity. According to common knowledge, the special principle of relativity\nwas first enunciated in 1632 by Galileo Galilei in his Dialogo sopra i due\nmassimi sistemi del mondo (Dialogue concerning the two chief world systems),\nusing the metaphor today known as \"Galileo's ship\": in a boat moving at\nconstant speed, the mechanical phenomena can be described by the same laws\nholding on Earth. We shall show that the same metaphor and some of the examples\nin Galilei's book were already contained in the dialogue La cena de le Ceneri\n(The Ash Wednesday Supper) published by Giordano Bruno in 1584. In fact,\nGiordano Bruno largely anticipated the arguments of Galilei on the relativity\nprinciple. It is likely that Galilei was aware of Bruno's work, and it is\npossible that the young Galilei discussed with Bruno, since they both stayed in\nVenezia for long periods in 1592.\n", "  The Dark Energy Survey (DES) is currently undertaking an observational\nprogram imaging $1/4$ of the southern hemisphere sky with unprecedented\nphotometric accuracy. In the process of observing millions of faint stars and\ngalaxies to constrain the parameters of the dark energy equation of state, the\nDES will obtain pre-discovery images of the regions surrounding an estimated\n100 gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) over five years. Once GRBs are detected by, e.g.,\nthe Swift satellite, the DES data will be extremely useful for follow-up\nobservations by the transient astronomy community. We describe a\nrecently-commissioned suite of software that listens continuously for automated\nnotices of GRB activity, collates useful information from archival DES data,\nand disseminates relevant data products back to the community in\nnear-real-time. Of particular importance are the opportunities that non-public\nDES data provide for relative photometry of the optical counterparts of GRBs,\nas well as for identifying key characteristics (e.g., photometric redshifts) of\npotential GRB host galaxies. We provide the functional details of the DESAlert\nsoftware as it presently operates, as well as the data products that it\nproduces, and we show sample results from the application of DESAlert to\nseveral previously-detected GRBs.\n", "  In eikonal and quenched approximation, it is argued that the strong coupling\nfermionic QCD Green's functions and related amplitudes depart from a sole\ndependence on the SUc(3) quadratic Casimir operator, C2f, evaluated over the\nfundamental gauge group representation. Noticed in non-relativistic Quark\nModels and in a non-perturbative generalization of the Schwinger mechanism, an\nadditional dependence on the cubic Casimir operator shows up, in\ncontradistinction with perturbation theory and other non-perturbative\napproaches. However, it accounts for the full algebraic content of the rank-2\nLie algebra of SUc(3). Though numerically sub-leading effects, cubic Casimir\ndependences, here and elsewhere, appear to be a signature of the\nnon-perturbative fermonic sector of QCD.\n", "  In this paper, we construct the first families of asymmetric quantum\nconvolutional codes (AQCC)'s. These new AQCC's are constructed by means of the\nCSS-type construction applied to suitable families of classical convolutional\ncodes, which are also constructed here. The new codes have noncatastrophic\ngenerator matrices and they present great asymmetry. Since our constructions\nare performed algebraically, it is possible to derive several families of such\ncodes and not only codes with specific parameters. Additionally, several\ndifferent types of such codes are obtained.\n", "  In this work, we establish an ICME list from 1996 to 2014 based on the\nin-situ observations from the WIND and ACE satellites. Based on this ICME list,\nwe extend the statistical analysis of the ICMEs to the solar maximum phase of\nsolar cycle 24th. The analysis of the annual variations of the properties of\nICMEs show that the number of ICMEs, the number of shocks, the percentage of\nICMEs drove shocks, the magnetic field and plasma properties of ICMEs are well\ncorrelated with the solar cycle variation. The number of MCs do not show any\ncorrelation with sunspot number. But, the percentage of the MCs in ICMEs show\ngood anti-correlation with the sunspot number. By comparison the parameters of\nMCs with None-MC ICMEs, we found that the MCs are stronger than the None-MC\nICMEs . In addition, we compare the parameters of ICMEs with and without\nshocks. It is found that the ICMEs with shocks are much stronger than the ICME\nwithout shocks. Meanwhile, we discuss the distribution of the magnetic field\nand solar wind plasmas parameters of the sheath regions of ICMEs at first time.\nWe find that the magnetic field and solar wind velocity in the sheath region\nare higher than them in the ejecta of ICMEs from statistical point of view.\n", "  We report on both high-precision photometry from the MOST space telescope and\nground-based spectroscopy of the triple system delta Ori A consisting of a\nbinary O9.5II+early-B (Aa1 and Aa2) with P = 5.7d, and a more distant tertiary\n(O9 IV P > 400 yrs). This data was collected in concert with X-ray spectroscopy\nfrom the Chandra X-ray Observatory. Thanks to continuous coverage for 3 weeks,\nthe MOST light curve reveals clear eclipses between Aa1 and Aa2 for the first\ntime in non-phased data. From the spectroscopy we have a well constrained\nradial velocity curve of Aa1. While we are unable to recover radial velocity\nvariations of the secondary star, we are able to constrain several fundamental\nparameters of this system and determine an approximate mass of the primary\nusing apsidal motion. We also detected second order modulations at 12 separate\nfrequencies with spacings indicative of tidally influenced oscillations. These\nspacings have never been seen in a massive binary, making this system one of\nonly a handful of such binaries which show evidence for tidally induced\npulsations.\n", "  Motivated by the discovery of prolate rotation of stars in Andromeda II, a\ndwarf spheroidal companion of M31, we study its origin via mergers of disky\ndwarf galaxies. We simulate merger events between two identical dwarfs changing\nthe initial inclination of their disks with respect to the orbit and the amount\nof orbital angular momentum. On radial orbits the amount of prolate rotation in\nthe merger remnants correlates strongly with the inclination of the disks and\nis well understood as due to the conservation of the angular momentum component\nof the disks along the merger axis. For non-radial orbits prolate rotation may\nstill be produced if the orbital angular momentum is initially not much larger\nthan the intrinsic angular momentum of the disks. The orbital structure of the\nremnants with significant rotation is dominated by box orbits in the center and\nlong-axis tubes in the outer parts. The frequency analysis of stellar orbits in\nthe plane perpendicular to the major axis reveals the presence of two families\nroughly corresponding to inner and outer long-axis tubes. The fraction of inner\ntubes is largest in the remnant forming from disks oriented most vertically\ninitially and is responsible for the boxy shape of the galaxy. We conclude that\nprolate rotation results from mergers with a variety of initial conditions and\nno fine tuning is necessary to reproduce this feature. We compare the\nproperties of our merger remnants to those of dwarfs resulting from the tidal\nstirring scenario and the data for Andromeda II.\n", "  In this article, we give nonexistence and nonuniqueness results for the\nvacuum Einstein conformal constraint equations in the far-from-CMC case and\nalso show that in some cases the equations of the conformal method for positive\nYamabe metrics and with TT-tensor $\\sigma$ = 0 have a non-trivial solution, and\nthus answer a question by D. Maxwell.\n", "  The influence of defect dipoles on the electrocaloric effect (ECE) in\nacceptor doped BaTiO$_3$ is studied by means of lattice-based Monte-Carlo\nsimulations. A Ginzburg-Landau type effective Hamiltonian is used. Oxygen\nvacancy-acceptor associates are described by fixed defect dipoles with\norientation parallel or anti-parallel to the external field. By a combination\nof canonical and microcanoncial simulations the ECE is directly evaluated. Our\nresults show that in the case of anti-parallel defect dipoles the ECE can be\npositive or negative depending on the density of defect dipoles. Moreover, a\ntransition from a negative to positive ECE can be observed from a certain\ndensity of anti-parallel dipoles on when the external field increases. These\ntransitions are due to the delicate interplay of internal and external fields,\nand are explained by the domain structure evolution and related field-induced\nentropy changes. The results are compared to those obtained by MD simulations\nemploying an {\\it{ab initio}} based effective Hamiltonian, and a good\nqualitative agreement is found. In addition, a novel electrocaloric cycle,\nwhich makes use of the negative ECE and defect dipoles, is proposed to enhance\nthe cooling effect.\n", "  The joint analysis of galaxy-galaxy lensing and galaxy clustering is a\npromising method for inferring the growth function of large scale structure.\nThis analysis will be carried out on data from the Dark Energy Survey (DES),\nwith its measurements of both the distribution of galaxies and the tangential\nshears of background galaxies induced by these foreground lenses. We develop a\npractical approach to modeling the assumptions and systematic effects affecting\nsmall scale lensing, which provides halo masses, and large scale galaxy\nclustering. Introducing parameters that characterize the halo occupation\ndistribution (HOD), photometric redshift uncertainties, and shear measurement\nerrors, we study how external priors on different subsets of these parameters\naffect our growth constraints. Degeneracies within the HOD model, as well as\nbetween the HOD and the growth function, are identified as the dominant source\nof complication, with other systematic effects sub-dominant. The impact of HOD\nparameters and their degeneracies necessitate the detailed joint modeling of\nthe galaxy sample that we employ. We conclude that DES data will provide\npowerful constraints on the evolution of structure growth in the universe,\nconservatively/optimistically constraining the growth function to 7.9\\%/4.8\\%\nwith its first-year data that covered over 1000 square degrees, and to\n3.9\\%/2.3\\% with its full five-year data that will survey 5000 square degrees,\nincluding both statistical and systematic uncertainties.\n", "  Quantum spin tunneling (QST) and Kondo effect are two very different quantum\nphenomena that produce the same effect on quantized spins, namely, the\nquenching of their magnetization. However, the nature of this quenching is very\ndifferent so that QST and Kondo effects compete with each other. Importantly,\nboth QST and Kondo produce very characteristic features in the spectral\nfunction that can be measured by means of single spin scanning tunneling\nspectroscopy that makes it possible to probe the crossover from one regime to\nthe other. We model this crossover, and the resulting changes in transport,\nusing a non-perturbative treatment of a generalized Anderson model including\nmagnetic anisotropy that leads to quantum spin tunneling. We predict that, at\nzero magnetic field, integer spins can feature a split-Kondo peak driven by\nquantum spin tunneling.\n", "  A nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond is a promising sensor for nanoscale\nmagnetic sensing. Here we report electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy\nusing a single NV center in diamond. First, using a 230 GHz ESR spectrometer,\nwe performed ensemble ESR of a type-Ib sample crystal and identified a\nsubstitutional single nitrogen impurity as a major paramagnetic center in the\nsample crystal. Then, we carried out free-induction decay and spin echo\nmeasurements of the single NV center to study static and dynamic properties of\nnanoscale bath spins surrounding the NV center. We also measured ESR spectrum\nof the bath spins using double electron-electron resonance spectroscopy with\nthe single NV center. The spectrum analysis of the NV-based ESR measurement\nidentified that the detected spins are the nitrogen impurity spins. The\nexperiment was also performed with several other single NV centers in the\ndiamond sample and demonstrated that the properties of the bath spins are\nunique to the NV centers indicating the probe of spins in the microscopic\nvolume using NV-based ESR. Finally, we discussed the number of spins detected\nby the NV-based ESR spectroscopy. By comparing the experimental result with\nsimulation, we estimated the number of the detected spins to be $\\leq$ 50\nspins.\n", "  Light beams having a vectorial field structure - or polarization - that\nvaries over the transverse profile and a central optical singularity are called\nvector-vortex (VV) beams and may exhibit specific properties, such as focusing\ninto \"light needles\" or rotation invariance, with applications ranging from\nmicroscopy and light trapping to communication and metrology. Individual\nphotons in such beams exhibit a form of single-particle quantum entanglement\nbetween different degrees of freedom. On the other hand, the quantum states of\ntwo photons can be also entangled with each other. Here we combine these two\nconcepts and demonstrate the generation of quantum entanglement between two\nphotons that are both in VV states - a new form of quantum \"entangled\nentanglement\". This result may lead to quantum-enhanced applications of VV\nbeams as well as to quantum-information protocols fully exploiting the\nvectorial features of light.\n", "  We formulate the spin foam representation of discrete SU(2) gauge theory as a\nproduct of vertex amplitudes each of which is the spin network generating\nfunction of the boundary graph dual to the vertex. In doing so the sums over\nspins have been carried out. The boundary data of each n-valent node is\nexplicitly reduced with respect to the local gauge invariance and has a\nmanifest geometrical interpretation as a framed polyhedron of fixed total area.\nUltimately, sums over spins are traded for contour integrals over simple poles\nand recoupling theory is avoided using generating functions.\n", "  We study the effect of resonances associated with complex molecular\ninteraction of Rydberg atoms on Rydberg blockade. We show that densely-spaced\nmolecular potentials between doubly-excited atomic pairs become unavoidably\nresonant with the optical excitation at short interatomic separations. Such\nmolecular resonances limit the coherent control of individual excitations in\nRydberg blockade. As an illustration, we compute the molecular interaction\npotentials of Rb atoms near the $100s$ states asymptote to characterize such\ndetrimental molecular resonances, determine the resonant loss rate to molecules\nand inhomogeneous light shifts. Techniques to avoid the undesired effect of\nmolecular resonances are discussed.\n", "  We present a Linearized Coupled Cluster (LCC) correction based on an\nAntisymmetric Product of 1 reference orbital Geminals (AP1roG) reference state.\nIn our LCC ansatz, the cluster operator is restricted to double and to single\nand double excitations as in standard single-reference CC theory. The\nperformance of the AP1roG-LCC models is tested for the dissociation of diatomic\nmolecules (C$_2$ and F$_2$), spectroscopic constants of the uranyl cation\n(UO$_2^{2+}$), and the symmetric dissociation of the H$_{50}$ hydrogen chain.\nOur study indicates that an LCC correction based on an AP1roG reference\nfunction is more robust and reliable than corrections based on perturbation\ntheory, yielding spectroscopic constants that are in very good agreement with\ntheoretical reference data.\n", "  We present a catalog of all CO (J=4-3 through J=13-12)), [CI], [NII] lines\navailable from extragalactic spectra from the Herschel SPIRE Fourier Transform\nSpectrometer (FTS) archive combined with observations of the low-J CO lines\nfrom the literature and from the Arizona Radio Observatory. This work examines\nthe relationships between LFIR, L'CO, and LCO/LCO(1-0). We also present a new\nmethod for estimating probability distribution functions (PDFs) from marginal\nsignal-to-noise ratio Herschel} FTS spectra, which takes into account the\ninstrumental \"ringing\" and the resulting highly correlated nature of the\nspectra. The slopes of log(LFIR) vs. log(L'CO) are linear for all mid- to\nhigh-J CO lines and slightly sublinear if restricted to (U)LIRGs. The mid- to\nhigh-J CO luminosity relative to CO J=1-0 increases with increasing LFIR,\nindicating higher excitement of the molecular gas, though these ratios do not\nexceed ~ 180. For a given bin in LFIR, the luminosities relative to CO J=1-0\nremain relatively flat from J=6-5 through J=13-12, across three orders of\nmagnitude of LFIR. A single component theoretical photon-dominated region (PDR)\nmodel cannot match these flat SLED shapes, though combinations of PDR models\nwith mechanical heating added qualitatively match the shapes, indicating the\nneed for further comprehensive modeling of the excitation processes of warm\nmolecular gas in nearby galaxies.\n", "  Electron sheaths form near the surface of objects biased more positive than\nthe plasma potential, such as in the electron saturation region of a Langmuir\nprobe trace. Generally, the formation of electron sheaths requires that the\nelectron-collecting area be sufficiently smaller ($\\sqrt{2.3m_e/M}$ times) than\nthe ion-collecting area. They are commonly thought to be local phenomena that\ncollect the random thermal electron current, but do not otherwise perturb a\nplasma. Here, using experiments on an electrode embedded in a wall,\nparticle-in-cell simulations and theory, it is shown that under low temperature\nplasma conditions ($T_e \\gg T_i$) electron sheaths are far from local. Instead,\na long presheath region (in excess of 70 $\\lambda_D$) extends into the plasma\nwhere electrons are accelerated via a pressure gradient to a flow speed\nexceeding the electron thermal speed at the sheath edge. This fast flow is\nfound to excite instabilities, causing strong fluctuations near the sheath\nedge.\n", "  Using data collected with the Belle detector at the KEKB asymmetric-energy\n$e^+e^-$ collider, we measure the energy dependence of the $e^+e^- \\to\nh_b(nP)\\pi^+\\pi^-$ $(n=1,2)$ cross sections from thresholds up to $11.02\\,$GeV.\nWe find clear $\\Upsilon(10860)$ and $\\Upsilon(11020)$ peaks with little or no\ncontinuum contribution. We study the resonant substructure of the\n$\\Upsilon(11020) \\to h_b(nP)\\pi^+\\pi^-$ transitions and find evidence that they\nproceed entirely via the intermediate isovector states $Z_b(10610)$ and\n$Z_b(10650)$. The relative fraction of these states is loosely constrained by\nthe current data: the hypothesis that only $Z_b(10610)$ is produced is excluded\nat the level of 3.3 standard deviations, while the hypothesis that only\n$Z_b(10650)$ is produced is not excluded at a significant level.\n", "  Humans are heterogenous and the behaviors of individuals could be different\nfrom that at the population level. We conduct an in-depth study of the temporal\npatterns of cellphone conversation activities of 73'339 anonymous cellphone\nusers with the same truncated Weibull distribution of inter-call durations. We\nfind that the individual call events exhibit a pattern of bursts, in which high\nactivity periods are alternated with low activity periods. Surprisingly, the\nnumber of events in high activity periods are found to conform to a power-law\ndistribution at the population level, but follow an exponential distribution at\nthe individual level, which is a hallmark of absence of memory in individual\ncall activities. Such exponential distribution is also observed for the number\nof events in low activity periods. Together with the exponential distributions\nof inter-call durations within bursts and of the intervals between consecutive\nbursts, we demonstrate that the individual call activities are driven by two\nindependent Poisson processes, which can be combined within a minimal model in\nterms of a two-state first-order Markov chain giving very good agreement with\nthe empirical distributions using the parameters estimated from real data for\nabout half of the individuals in our sample. By measuring directly the\ndistributions of call rates across the population, which exhibit power-law\ntails, we explain the difference with previous population level studies,\npurporting the existence of power-law distributions, via the \"Superposition of\nDistributions\" mechanism: The superposition of many exponential distributions\nof activities with a power-law distribution of their characteristic scales\nleads to a power-law distribution of the activities at the population level.\n", "  We present an analysis of X-ray, Ultraviolet and optical/near-IR photometric\ndata of the transitional millisecond pulsar binary XSSJ12270-4859, obtained at\ndifferent epochs after the transition to a rotation-powered radio pulsar state.\nThe observations, while confirming the large-amplitude orbital modulation found\nin previous studies after the state change, also reveal an energy dependence of\nthe amplitudes as well as variations on time scale of months. The amplitude\nvariations are anti-correlated in the X-ray and the UV/optical bands. The\naverage X-ray spectrum is described by a power law with \\Gamma index of 1.07(8)\nwithout requiring an additional thermal component. The power law index \\Gamma\nvaries from 1.2 to 1.0 between superior and inferior conjunction of the neutron\nstar. We interpret the observed X-ray behaviour in terms of synchrotron\nradiation emitted in an extended intrabinary shock, located between the pulsar\nand the donor star, which is eclipsed due to the companion orbital motion. The\nG5 type donor dominates the UV/optical and near-IR emission and is similarly\nfound to be heated up to ? 6500K as in the disc state. The analysis of optical\nlight curves gives a binary inclination 46 < i < 65deg and a mass ratio 0.11 <\nq <0.26. The donor mass is found to be 0.15 < M2 < 0.36Msun for a neutron star\nmass of 1.4Msun. The variations in the amplitude of the orbital modulation are\ninterpreted in terms of small changes in the mass flow rate from the donor\nstar. The spectral energy distribution from radio to gamma-rays is composed by\nmultiple contributions that are different from those observed during the\naccretion-powered state.\n", "  The variability of the broad absorption lines is investigated for a broad\nabsorption line (BAL) QSO, SDSS J022844.09+000217.0 (z = 2.719), with 18\nSDSS/BOSS spectra covering 4128 days in the observed frame. With the ratio of\nthe rms spectrum to the mean spectrum, the relative flux change of the\nBAL-trough is larger than that of the emission lines and the continuum. Fitting\nthe power-law continuum and the emission line profiles of \\civ $\\lambda$1549\nand \\siiv$\\lambda$1399, we calculate the equivalent width (EW) for different\nepochs, as well as the continuum luminosity and the spectral index. It is found\nthat there is a strong correlation between the BAL-trough EW and the spectral\nindex, and a weak negative correlation between the BAL-trough EW and the\ncontinuum luminosity. The strong correlation between the BAL-trough EW and the\nspectral index for this one QSO suggests that dust is intrinsic to outflows.\nThe weak correlation between the BAL variability and the continuum luminosity\nfor this one QSO implies that the BAL-trough variation is not dominated by\nphotoionization.\n", "  We employ high-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulations focusing on a\nhigh-sigma peak and an average cosmological field at $z\\sim 6-12$, in order to\ninvestigate the influence of environment and baryonic feedback on galaxy\nevolution in the reionization epoch. Strong feedback, e.g., galactic winds,\ncaused by elevated star formation rates (SFRs) is expected to play an important\nrole in this evolution. We compare different outflow prescriptions: (i)\nconstant wind velocity (CW), (ii) variable wind scaling with galaxy properties\n(VW), and (iii) no outflows (NW). The overdensity leads to accelerated\nevolution of dark matter and baryonic structures, absent in the \"normal\"\nregion, and to shallow galaxy stellar mass functions at the low-mass end.\nAlthough CW shows little dependence on both environments, the more physically\nmotivated VW model does exhibit this effect. In addition, VW can reproduce the\nobserved specific SFR (sSFR) and the sSFR-stellar mass relation, which CW and\nNW fail to satisfy simultaneously. Winds also differ substantially in affecting\nthe state of the intergalactic medium (IGM). The difference lies in\nvolume-filling factor of hot, high-metallicity gas which is near unity for CW,\nwhile it remains confined in massive filaments for VW, and locked up in\ngalaxies for NW. Such gas is nearly absent in the normal region. Although all\nwind models suffer from deficiencies, the VW model seems to be promising in\ncorrelating the outflow properties to those of host galaxies. Further\nconstraints on the state of the IGM at high-$z$ are needed to separate\ndifferent wind models.\n", "  Multi-field inflation models include a variety of scenarios for how inflation\nproceeds and ends. Models with the same potential but different kinetic terms\nare common in the literature. We compare spiral inflation and Dante's\ninferno-type models, which differ only in their field-space metric. We justify\na single-field effective description in these models and relate the\nsingle-field description to a mass-matrix formalism. We note the effects of the\nnontrivial field-space metric on inflationary observables, and consequently on\nthe viability of these models. We also note a duality between spiral inflation\nand Dante's inferno models with different potentials.\n", "  We apply the new method for constructing integrable Hamiltonian hierarchies\nof Lax type equations developed in our previous paper, to show that all\nW-algebras W(gl_N,f) carry such a hierarchy. As an application, we show that\nall vector constrained KP hierarchies and their matrix generalizations are\nobtained from these hierarchies by Dirac reduction, which provides the former\nwith a bi-Poisson structure.\n", "  The network paradigm for quantum computing involves interconnecting many\nmodules to form a scalable machine. Typically it is assumed that the links\nbetween modules are prone to noise while operations within modules have\nsignificantly higher fidelity. To optimise fault tolerance in such\narchitectures we introduce a hierarchical generalisation of the surface code: a\nsmall `patch' of the code exists within each module, and constitutes a single\neffective qubit of the logic-level surface code. Errors primarily occur in a\ntwo-dimensional subspace, i.e. patch perimeters extruded over time, and the\nresulting noise threshold for inter-module links can exceed ~ 10% even in the\nabsence of purification. Increasing the number of qubits within each module\ndecreases the number of qubits necessary for encoding a logical qubit. But this\nadvantage is relatively modest, and broadly speaking a `fine grained' network\nof small modules containing only ~ 8 qubits is competitive in total qubit count\nversus a `course' network with modules containing many hundreds of qubits.\n", "  We investigate gauge invariant scalar fluctuations of the metric during\ninflation in a non-perturbative formalism in the framework of a recently\nintroduced scalar-tensor theory of gravity formulated on a Weyl-Integrable\ngeometry. We found that the Weyl scalar field can play the role of the inflaton\nfield in this theory. As an application we study the case of a power law\ninflation. In this case the quasi-scale invariance of the spectrum for scalar\nfluctuations of the metric is achieved for determined values of the $\\omega$\nparameter of the scalar-tensor theory. In our formalism the physical inflaton\nfield has a geometrical origin.\n", "  We show the existence of a general mechanism by which heavy scalar fields can\nbe destabilized during inflation, relying on the fact that the curvature of the\nfield space manifold can dominate the stabilizing force from the potential and\ndestabilize inflationary trajectories. We describe a simple and rather\nuniversal setup in which higher-order operators suppressed by a large energy\nscale trigger this instability. This phenomenon can prematurely end inflation,\nthereby leading to important observational consequences and sometimes excluding\nmodels that would otherwise perfectly fit the data. More generally, it modifies\nthe interpretation of cosmological constraints in terms of fundamental physics.\nWe also explain how the geometrical destabilization can lead to powerful\nselection criteria on the field space curvature of inflationary models.\n", "  Quantum field theory predicts Weyl semimetals to possess a peculiar response\nof the longitudinal current density to the application of a DC magnetic field.\nSuch a response function has been shown to be at odds with a general result\nshowing the vanishing of the bulk current in an equilibrium system on any real\nmaterial with a lattice in an external magnetic field. Here we resolve this\napparent contradiction by introducing a model where a current flows in response\nto a magnetic field even without Weyl nodes. We point out that the previous\nderivation of a vanishing CME in the limit of vanishing real frequency is a\nconsequence of the assumption of periodic boundary conditions of the system. A\nmore realistic system with open boundary conditions is not subject to these\nconstraints and can have a non-vanishing CME. Consistent with recent work, we\nfound the finite frequency CME to be non-vanishing in general when there was a\nnon-vanishing Berry curvature on the Fermi surface. This does not necessitate\nhaving a topological Berry flux as in the case of a Weyl node. Finally, we\nstudy how the perturbation theory in magnetic field might be more stable in the\npresence of disorder. Using the standard diagrammatic treatment of disorder\nwithin the Born approximation, we have found that in a realistic disordered\nsystem, the chiral magnetic response is really a dynamical phenomena and\nvanishes in the DC limit.\n", "  The search for the curl component (B mode) in the cosmic microwave background\n(CMB) polarization induced by inflationary gravitational waves is described.\nThe canonical single-field slow-roll model of inflation is presented, and we\nexplain the quantum production of primordial density perturbations and\ngravitational waves. It is shown how these gravitational waves then give rise\nto polarization in the CMB. We then describe the geometric decomposition of the\nCMB polarization pattern into a curl-free component (E mode) and curl component\n(B mode) and show explicitly that gravitational waves induce B modes. We\ndiscuss the B modes induced by gravitational lensing and by Galactic\nforegrounds and show how both are distinguished from those induced by\ninflationary gravitational waves. Issues involved in the experimental pursuit\nof these B modes are described, and we summarize some of the strategies being\npursued. We close with a brief discussion of some other avenues toward\ndetecting/characterizing the inflationary gravitational-wave background.\n", "  We investigate the luminescence of Ga- and N-polar\nIn$_{x}$Ga$_{1-x}$N/In$_{y}$Ga$_{1-y}$N quantum wells (QWs) grown by\nplasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy on freestanding GaN as well as 6H-SiC\nsubstrates. In striking contrast to their Ga-polar counterparts, the N-polar\nQWs prepared on freestanding GaN do not exhibit any detectable\nphotoluminescence. Theoretical simulations of the band profiles combined with\nresonant excitation of the QWs allow us to rule out carrier escape and\nsubsequent surface recombination as the reason for the absence of luminescence.\nTo explore the hypothesis of a high concentration of nonradiative defects at\nthe interfaces between wells and barriers, we analyze Ga- and N-polar QWs\nprepared on 6H-SiC as a function of the well width. Intense luminescence is\nobserved for both Ga- and N polar samples. As expected, the luminescence of the\nGa-polar QWs quenches and red-shifts with increasing well width due to the\nquantum confined Stark effect. In contrast, both the intensity and the energy\nof the luminescence from the N-polar samples are essentially independent of\nwell width. Transmission electron microscopy reveals that the N-polar QWs\nexhibit abrupt interfaces and homogeneous composition, excluding emission from\nIn-rich clusters as the reason for this anomalous behavior. The microscopic\norigin of the luminescence in the N-polar QWs is elucidated using spatially\nresolved cathodoluminescence spectroscopy. Regardless of well width, the\nluminescence is found to not originate from the N-polar QWs, but from the\nsemipolar facets of v-pit defects. These results cast serious doubts on the\npotential of N-polar QWs grown by plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy for\nthe development of long-wavelength light emitting diodes. What remains to be\nseen is whether unconventional growth conditions may enable a significant\nreduction in the concentration of nonradiative defects.\n", "  We use electronic transport and atom probe tomography to study ZnO:Al / SiO2\n/ Si Schottky junctions on lightly-doped n- and p-type Si. We vary the carrier\nconcentration in the the ZnO:Al films by two orders of magnitude but the\nSchottky barrier height remains constant, consistent with Fermi level pinning\nseen in metal / Si junctions. Atom probe tomography shows that Al segregates to\nthe interface, so that the ZnO:Al at the junction is likely to be metallic even\nwhen the bulk of the ZnO:Al film is semiconducting. We hypothesize that Fermi\nlevel pinning is connected to the insulator-metal transition in doped ZnO, and\nthat controlling this transition may be key to un-pinning the Fermi level in\noxide / Si Schottky junctions.\n", "  We propose an interferometric scheme based on an untrapped nano-object\nsubjected to gravity. The motion of the center of mass (c.m.) of the free\nobject is coupled to its internal spin system magnetically, and a free flight\nscheme is developed based on coherent spin control. The wavepacket of the test\nobject, under a spin-dependent force, may then be delocalized to a macroscopic\nscale. A gravity induced dynamical phase (accrued solely on the spin state, and\nmeasured through a Ramsey scheme) is used to reveal the above spatially\ndelocalised superposition of the spin-nano-object composite system that arises\nduring our scheme. We find a remarkable immunity to the motional noise in the\nc.m. (initially in a thermal state with moderate cooling), and also a dynamical\ndecoupling nature of the scheme itself. Together they secure a high visibility\nof the resulting Ramsey fringes. The mass independence of our scheme makes it\nviable for a nano-object selected from an ensemble with a high mass\nvariability. Given these advantages, a quantum superposition with $100$ nm\nspatial separation for a massive object of $10^9$ amu is achievable\nexperimentally, providing a route to test postulated modifications of quantum\ntheory such as continuous spontaneous localisation.\n", "  The indeterminacy inherent in quantum measurement is an outstanding character\nof quantum theory, which manifests itself typically in Heisenberg's\nerror-disturbance uncertainty relation. In the last decade, Heisenberg's\nrelation has been generalized to hold for completely general quantum\nmeasurements. Nevertheless, the strength of those relations has not been\nclarified yet for mixed quantum states. Recently, a new error-disturbance\nuncertainty relation (EDUR), stringent for generalized input states, has been\nintroduced by one of the present authors. A neutron-optical experiment is\ncarried out to investigate this new relation: it is tested whether error and\ndisturbance of quantum measurements disappear or persist in mixing up the\nmeasured ensemble. Our results exhibit that measurement error and disturbance\nremain constant independent of the degree of mixture. The tightness of the new\nEDUR is confirmed, thereby validating the theoretical prediction.\n", "  To depict the complex relationship among nodes and the evolving process of a\ncomplex system, a Bose-Einstein hypernetwork is proposed in this paper. Based\non two basic evolutionary mechanisms, growth and preference jumping, the\ndistribution of hyperedge cardinalities is studied. The Poisson process theory\nis used to describe the arrival process of new node batches. And, by using the\nPoisson process theory and a continuity technique, the hypernetwork is analyzed\nand the characteristic equation of hyperedge cardinalities is obtained.\nAdditionally, an analytical expression for the stationary average hyperedge\ncardinality distribution is derived by employing the characteristic equation,\nfrom which Bose-Einstein condensation in the hypernetwork is obtained. The\ntheoretical analyses in this paper agree with the conducted numerical\nsimulations. This is the first study on the hyperedge cardinality in\nhypernetworks, where Bose-Einstein condensation can be regarded as a special\ncase of hypernetworks. Moreover, a condensation degree is also discussed with\nwhich Bose-Einstein condensation can be classified.\n", "  The Magellanic Clouds are surrounded by an extended network of gaseous\nstructures. Chief among these is the Magellanic Stream, an interwoven tail of\nfilaments trailing the Clouds in their orbit around the Milky Way. When\nconsidered in tandem with its Leading Arm, the Stream stretches over 200\ndegrees on the sky. Thought to represent the result of tidal interactions\nbetween the Clouds and ram-pressure forces exerted by the Galactic corona, its\nkinematic properties reflect the dynamical history of the closest pair of dwarf\ngalaxies to the Milky Way. The Stream is a benchmark for hydrodynamical\nsimulations of accreting gas and cloud/corona interactions. If the Stream\nsurvives these interactions and arrives safely in the Galactic disk, its cargo\nof over a billion solar masses of gas has the potential to maintain or elevate\nthe Galactic star formation rate. In this article, we review the current state\nof knowledge of the Stream, including its chemical composition, physical\nconditions, origin, and fate. We also review the dynamics of the Magellanic\nSystem, including the proper motions and orbital history of the Large and Small\nMagellanic Clouds, the first-passage and second-passage scenarios, and the\nevidence for a Magellanic Group of galaxies.\n", "  We consider one of the fundamental debates in performing the relativity\ntheory, namely, the ether and the relativity points of view, in a way to aid\nthe learning of the subjects. In addition, we present our views and prospects\nwhile describing the issues that being accessible to many physicists and\nallowing broader views. Also, we very briefly review the two almost recent\nobservations of the Webb redshift and the ultra high-energy cosmic rays, and\nthe modified relativity models that have been presented to justify them,\nwherein we express that these justifications have not been performed via a\nsingle model with a single mechanism.\n", "  We prove the existence and some properties of the limiting gap distribution\nfunctions for the directions of orbits of some infinite covolume subgroups of\n$Isom(\\mathbb{H}^2)$ in the Poincar\\'e disk.\n", "  Hot Jupiters, giant extrasolar planets with orbital periods shorter than ~10\ndays, have long been thought to form at large radial distances, only to\nsubsequently experience long-range inward migration. Here, we propose that in\ncontrast with this picture, a substantial fraction of the hot Jupiter\npopulation formed in situ via the core accretion process. We show that under\nconditions appropriate to the inner regions of protoplanetary disks, rapid gas\naccretion can be initiated by Super-Earth type planets, comprising 10-20 Earth\nmasses of refractory composition material. An in situ formation scenario leads\nto testable consequences, including the expectation that hot Jupiters should\nfrequently be accompanied by additional low-mass planets with periods shorter\nthan ~100 days. Our calculations further demonstrate that dynamical\ninteractions during the early stages of planetary systems' lifetimes should\nincrease the inclinations of such companions, rendering transits rare.\nHigh-precision radial velocity monitoring provides the best prospect for their\ndetection.\n", "  The bulk of cosmic matter resides in a dilute reservoir that fills the space\nbetween galaxies, the intergalactic medium (IGM). The history of this reservoir\nis intimately tied to the cosmic histories of structure formation, star\nformation, and supermassive black hole accretion. Our models for the IGM at\nintermediate redshifts (2<z<5) are a tremendous success, quantitatively\nexplaining the statistics of Lyman-alpha absorption of intergalactic hydrogen.\nHowever, at both lower and higher redshifts (and around galaxies) much is still\nunknown about the IGM. We review the theoretical models and measurements that\nform the basis for the modern understanding of the IGM, and we discuss unsolved\npuzzles (ranging from the largely unconstrained process of reionization at\nhigh-z to the missing baryon problem at low-z), highlighting the efforts that\nhave the potential to solve them.\n", "  We study simultaneous evolution of electron, neutrino and quark asymmetries,\nand large scale hypermagnetic fields in the symmetric phase of the electroweak\nplasma in the temperature range $100$GeV$\\leq T\\leq 10$TeV, taking into account\nthe chirality flip processes via inverse Higgs decays and fermion number\nviolation due to Abelian anomalies. We present a derivation of the coefficient\nof the Chern-Simons term for the hypercharge gauge field, showing that the\nleft-handed and right-handed components of each fermion species contribute with\nopposite sign. This is in contrast to the results presented in some of the\nprevious works. The $\\textrm{U}_{\\textrm{Y}}(1)$ Chern-Simons term affects the\nresulting anomalous magnetohydrodynamic (AMHD) equations. We solve the\nresulting coupled evolution equations for the lepton and baryon asymmetries, as\nwell as the hypermagnetic field to obtain their time evolution along with their\nvalues at the electroweak phase transition ($T_{EW} \\sim 100$GeV) for a variety\nof critical ranges for their initial values at $T=10$TeV. We first investigate\nthe results of this sign change, by directly comparing our results with those\nobtained in one of the previous works and find that matter asymmetry generation\nincreases considerably in the presence of a strong hypermagnetic field.\nFurthermore, we find that a strong hypermagnetic field can generate matter\nasymmetry starting from absolutely zero asymmetry, while matter asymmetry can\ngenerate a hypermagnetic field provided the initial value of the latter is\nnonzero.\n", "  In this paper, we consider the Universe at the late stage of its evolution\nand deep inside the cell of uniformity. At these scales, we consider the\nUniverse to be filled with dust-like matter in the form of discretely\ndistributed galaxies, a minimally coupled scalar field and radiation as matter\nsources. We investigate such a Universe in the mechanical approach. This means\nthat the peculiar velocities of the inhomogeneities (in the form of galaxies)\nas well as fluctuations of other perfect fluids are non-relativistic. Such\nfluids are designated as coupled because they are concentrated around\ninhomogeneities. In the present paper we investigate the conditions under which\na scalar field can become coupled, and show that, at the background level, such\ncoupled scalar field behaves as a two component perfect fluid: a network of\nfrustrated cosmic strings with EoS parameter $w=-1/3$ and a cosmological\nconstant. The potential of this scalar field is very flat at the present time.\nHence, the coupled scalar field can provide the late cosmic acceleration. The\nfluctuations of the energy density and pressure of this field are concentrated\naround the galaxies screening their gravitational potentials. Therefore, such\nscalar fields can be regarded as coupled to the inhomogeneities.\n", "  We consider a dynamical model of distress propagation on complex networks,\nwhich we apply to the study of financial contagion in networks of banks\nconnected to each other by direct exposures. The model that we consider is an\nextension of the DebtRank algorithm, recently introduced in the literature. The\nmechanics of distress propagation is very simple: When a bank suffers a loss,\ndistress propagates to its creditors, who in turn suffer losses, and so on. The\noriginal DebtRank assumes that losses are propagated linearly between connected\nbanks. Here we relax this assumption and introduce a one-parameter family of\nnon-linear propagation functions. As a case study, we apply this algorithm to a\ndata-set of 183 European banks, and we study how the stability of the system\ndepends on the non-linearity parameter under different stress-test scenarios.\nWe find that the system is characterized by a transition between a regime where\nsmall shocks can be amplified and a regime where shocks do not propagate, and\nthat the overall stability of the system increases between 2008 and 2013.\n", "  We show that generalizations of classical and quantum dynamics with two times\nlead to fundamentally constrained evolution. At the level of classical physics,\nNewton's second law is extended and exactly integrated in $1+2$ dimensional\nspace, leading to effective single-time evolution for any initial condition. In\nthe domain of quantum mechanics, we follow strictly the hypothesis of\nprobability conservation by extending the Heisenberg picture to unitary\nevolution with two times. As a result, the observability of two temporal axes\nis constrained by a generalized uncertainty relation involving level spacings,\ntotal duration of the effect and Planck's constant.\n", "  We consider f(R,T) modified theory of gravity in which, in general, the\ngravitational Lagrangian is given by an arbitrary function of the Ricci scalar\nand the trace of the energy-momentum tensor. We indicate that in this type of\nthe theory, the coupling energy-momentum tensor is~not conserved. However, we\nmainly focus on a particular model that matter is minimally coupled to the\ngeometry in the metric formalism and wherein, its coupling energy--momentum\ntensor is also conserved. We obtain the corresponding Raychaudhuri dynamical\nequation that presents the evolution of the kinematic quantities. Then for the\nchosen model, we derive the behavior of the deceleration parameter, and show\nthat the coupling term can lead to an acceleration phase after the matter\ndominated phase. On the other hand, the curvature of the universe corresponds\nwith the deviation from parallelism in the geodesic motion. Thus, we also\nscrutinize the motion of the free test particles on their geodesics, and derive\nthe geodesic deviation equation in this modified theory to study the\naccelerating universe within the spatially flat FLRW background. Actually, this\nequation gives the relative accelerations of adjacent particles as a measurable\nphysical quantity, and provides an elegant tool to investigate the timelike and\nthe null structures of spacetime geometries. Then, through the null deviation\nvector, we find the observer area-distance as a function of the redshift for\nthe chosen model, and compare the results with the corresponding results\nobtained in the literature.\n", "  We investigate the statistical nature of the dark matter particles produced\nin bouncing cosmology, especially, the evolution of its thermal fluctuations.\nBy explicitly deriving and solving the equation of motion of super-horizon\nmode, we fully determine the evolution of thermal perturbation of dark matter\nin a generic bouncing background. And we also show that the evolution of\nsuper-horizon modes is stable and will not ruin the background evolution of a\ngeneric bouncing universe till the Planck scale. Given no super-horizon thermal\nperturbation of dark matter appears in standard inflation scenario such as\nWIMP(-less) miracles, such super-horizon thermal perturbation of dark matter\ngenerated during the generic bouncing universe scenario may be significant for\ntesting and distinguishing these two scenario in near future.\n", "  We propose a new parametrization of the background equations of motion\ncorresponding to (canonical) single-field models of inflation, which allows a\nbetter understanding of the general properties of the solutions and of the\ncorresponding predictions in the inflationary observables. Based on the tools\nof dynamical systems, the method suggests that inflation comes in two flavors:\npower-law and de Sitter. Power-law inflation seems to occur for a restricted\ntype of potentials, whereas de Sitter inflation has a much broader\napplicability. We also show a general perturbative method, by means of series\nexpansion, to solve the new equations of motion around the critical point of\nthe de Sitter type, and how the method can be used for arbitrary models of de\nSitter inflation. It is then argued that for the latter there are two general\nclasses of inflationary solutions, given in terms of the behavior of the\ntensor-to-scalar ratio as a function of the number $N$ of $e$-folds before the\nend of inflation: $r \\sim N^{-1}$ (Class I), or $r \\sim N^{-2}$ (Class II). We\ngive some examples of the two classes in terms of known scalar field\npotentials, and compare their general predictions with constraints obtained\nfrom observations.\n", "  We report broadband characterization of the propagation of light through a\nmultiply scattering medium by means of its Multi-Spectral Transmission Matrix.\nUsing a single spatial light modulator, our approach enables the full control\nof both spatial and spectral properties of an ultrashort pulse transmitted\nthrough the medium. We demonstrate spatiotemporal focusing of the pulse at any\narbitrary position and time with any desired spectral shape. Our approach opens\nnew perspectives for fundamental studies of light-matter interaction in\ndisordered media, and has potential applications in sensing, coherent control\nand imaging.\n", "  We investigate the extended Higgs sectors, specially the charged Higgs sector\nin a supersymmetric $Y=0$ $SU(2)$ triplet and a Standard Model (SM) gauge\nsinglet extension of SM. We show that in this model the allowed data for the\nHiggs boson interaction eigenstates tend to group into separate blocks for\n$SU(2)$ triplet, doublet and singlet. The triplet sector has two degenerate\npaired states, each pair composed of a mostly-triplet charged Higgs and of a\nmostly-triplet scalar or pseudoscalar state. The mostly-doublet sector involves\na Standard Model like Higgs of 125 GeV and extra mass-degenerate states,\ncomposed of a charged, a scalar and a pseudoscalar. The CP-odd component of the\nsinglet scalar, after supersymmetry breaking, takes the role of a\npseudo-Nambu-Goldstone mode in the $Z_3$ symmetric case, while the CP-even one\nbecomes decoupled. In a second part of our study we investigate the different\ndecay processes allowed to a charged Higgs boson of this model. Specifically,\nwe search for general signatures of the TNMSSM in order to distinguish among\nHiggs fields belonging to $SU(2)$ doublet, triplet and singlet representations\nat the LHC. We also propose few golden plated final state modes carrying the\ndistinctive signatures of this model which could be investigated in collider\nsearches. We also show how in the decoupling limit of the triplet ($|\\lambda_T|\n\\simeq 0$) affects the decays as well as the production channels at the LHC.\n", "  The anisotropic two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) layered materials,\nwith both scientific interest and potential application, have one more\ndimension to tune the properties than the isotropic 2D materials. The\ninterlayer vdW coupling determines the properties of 2D multi-layer materials\nby varying stacking orders. As an important representative anisotropic 2D\nmaterials, multilayer rhenium disulfide (ReS2) was expected to be random\nstacking and lack of interlayer coupling. Here, we demonstrate two stable\nstacking orders (aa and a-b) of N layer (NL, N>1) ReS2 from ultralow-frequency\nand high-frequency Raman spectroscopy, photoluminescence spectroscopy and\nfirst-principles density functional theory calculation. Two interlayer shear\nmodes are observed in aa-stacked NL-ReS2 while only one interlayer shear mode\nappears in a-b-stacked NL-ReS2, suggesting anisotropic-like and isotropic-like\nstacking orders in aa- and a-b-stacked NL-ReS2, respectively. The frequency of\nthe interlayer shear and breathing modes reveals unexpected strong interlayer\ncoupling in aa- and a-b-NL-ReS2, the force constants of which are 55-90% to\nthose of multilayer MoS2. The observation of strong interlayer coupling and\npolytypism in multi-layer ReS2 stimulate future studies on the structure,\nelectronic and optical properties of other 2D anisotropic materials.\n", "  We study the Littlest Higgs model with T-parity (LHT) in the process of $pp\n\\to W_H^+W_H^- \\to W^+W^- A_H A_H$ at the 14 TeV LHC. With the $W$-jet tagging\ntechnique, we demonstrate that the bulk of the model parameter space can be\nprobed at the level of more than $5\\sigma$ in the signature of two fat $W$-jets\nplus large missing energy. Furthermore, we propose a novel strategy of\nmeasuring the principle parameter $f$ that is crucial to testify the LHT model\nand to fix mass spectrum, including dark matter particle. Our proposal can be\neasily incorporated into current experimental program of diboson searches at\nthe LHC Run-II.\n", "  We present a novel proposal for generating quantum superpositions of\nmacroscopically distinct states of a bulk mechanical oscillator, compatible\nwith existing optomechanical devices operating in the readily achievable\nbad-cavity limit. The scheme is based on a pulsed cavity optomechanical quantum\nnon-demolition (QND) interaction, driven by displaced non-Gaussian states, and\nmeasurement-induced feedback, avoiding the need for strong single-photon\noptomechanical coupling. Furthermore, we show that single-quadrature cooling of\nthe mechanical oscillator is sufficient for efficient state preparation, and we\noutline a three-pulse protocol comprising a sequence of QND interactions for\nsqueezing-enhanced cooling, state preparation, and tomography.\n", "  Interstellar hydrides -- that is, molecules containing a single heavy element\natom with one or more hydrogen atoms -- were among the first molecules detected\noutside the solar system. They lie at the root of interstellar chemistry, being\namong the first species to form in initially-atomic gas, along with molecular\nhydrogen and its associated ions. Because the chemical pathways leading to the\nformation of interstellar hydrides are relatively simple, the analysis of the\nobserved abundances is relatively straightforward and provides key information\nabout the environments where hydrides are found. Recent years have seen rapid\nprogress in our understanding of interstellar hydrides, thanks largely to\nfar-IR and submillimeter observations performed with the Herschel Space\nObservatory. In this review, we will discuss observations of interstellar\nhydrides, along with the advanced modeling approaches that have been used to\ninterpret them, and the unique information that has thereby been obtained.\n", "  We study the connection between spherical wedge and full spherical shell\ngeometries using simple mean-field $\\alpha^2$ dynamos. We solve the equations\nfor a one-dimensional time-dependent mean-field dynamo to examine the effects\nof varying the polar angle $\\theta_0$ between the latitudinal boundaries and\nthe poles in spherical coordinates. We investigate the effects of turbulent\nmagnetic diffusivity and $\\alpha$ effect profiles as well as different\nlatitudinal boundary conditions to isolate parameter regimes where oscillatory\nsolutions are found. Finally, we add shear along with a damping term mimicking\nradial gradients to study the resulting dynamo regimes. We find that the\ncommonly used perfect conductor boundary condition leads to oscillatory\n$\\alpha^2$ dynamo solutions only if the wedge boundary is at least one degree\naway from the poles. Other boundary conditions always produce stationary\nsolutions. By varying the profile of the turbulent magnetic diffusivity alone,\noscillatory solutions are achieved with models extending to the poles, but the\nmagnetic field is strongly concentrated near the poles and the oscillation\nperiod is very long. By introducing radial shear and a damping term mimicking\nradial gradients, we again see oscillatory dynamos, and the direction of drift\nfollows the Parker--Yoshimura rule. Oscillatory solutions in the weak shear\nregime are found only in the wedge case with $\\theta_0 = 1^\\circ$ and perfect\nconductor boundaries. A reduced $\\alpha$ effect near the poles with a turbulent\ndiffusivity concentrated toward the equator yields oscillatory dynamos with\nequatorward migration and reproduces best the solutions in spherical wedges.\n", "  We track subhalo orbits of galaxy and group sized halos in cosmological\nsimulations. We identify filamentary structures around halos and we use these\nto define a sample of subhalos accreted from filaments as well as a control\nsample of subhalos accreted from other directions. We use these samples to\nstudy differences in satellite orbits produced by filamentary accretion. Our\nresults depend on host halo mass. We find that for low masses, subhalos\naccreted from filaments show $\\sim10\\%$ shorter lifetimes compared to the\ncontrol sample, they show a tendency towards more radial orbits, reach halo\ncentral regions earlier, and are more likely to merge with the host. For higher\nmass halos this lifetime difference dissipates and even reverses for cluster\nsized halos. This behavior appears to be connected to the fact that more\nmassive hosts are connected to stronger filaments with higher velocity\ncoherence and density, with slightly more radial subhalo orbits. Because\nsubhalos tend to follow the coherent flow of the filament, it is possible that\nsuch thick filaments are enough to shield the subhalo from the effect of\ndynamical friction at least during their first infall. We also identify subhalo\npairs/clumps which merge with one another after accretion. They survive as a\nclump for only a very short time, which is even shorter for higher subhalo\nmasses, suggesting that the Magellanic Clouds and other Local group satellite\nassociations, may have entered the MW virial radius very recently and probably\nare in their first infall. Filaments boost the accretion of satellite\nassociations.\n", "  The hierarchical triple body approximation has useful applications to a\nvariety of systems from planetary and stellar scales to supermassive black\nholes. In this approximation, the energy of each orbit is separately conserved\nand therefore the two semi-major axes are constants. On timescales much larger\nthan the orbital periods, the orbits exchange angular momentum which leads to\neccentricity and orientation (i.e., inclination) oscillations. The orbits'\neccentricity can reach extreme values leading to a nearly radial motion, which\ncan further evolve into short orbit periods and merging binaries. Furthermore,\nthe orbits' mutual inclination may change dramatically from pure prograde to\npure retrograde leading to misalignment and a wide range of inclinations. This\ndynamical behavior is coined as the \"eccentric Kozai-Lidov\" mechanism. The\nbehavior of such a system is exciting, rich and chaotic in nature. Furthermore,\nthese dynamics are accessible from a large part of the triple body parameter\nspace and can be applied to diverse range of astrophysical settings and used to\ngain insights to many puzzles.\n", "  Using N-body simulations we study the formation and evolution of tidally\ninduced bars in disky galaxies in clusters. Our progenitor is a massive,\nlate-type galaxy similar to the Milky Way, composed of an exponential disk and\nan NFW dark matter halo. We place the galaxy on four different orbits in a\nVirgo-like cluster and evolve it for 10 Gyr. As a reference case we also evolve\nthe same model in isolation. Tidally induced bars form on all orbits soon after\nthe first pericenter passage and survive until the end of the evolution. They\nappear earlier, are stronger, longer and have lower pattern speeds for tighter\norbits. Only for the tightest orbit the properties of the bar are controlled by\nthe orientation of the tidal torque from the cluster at pericenters. The\nmechanism behind the formation of the bars is the angular momentum transfer\nfrom the galaxy stellar component to its halo. All bars undergo extended\nperiods of buckling instability that occur earlier and lead to more pronounced\nboxy/peanut shapes when the tidal forces are stronger. Using all simulation\noutputs of galaxies at different evolutionary stages we construct a toy model\nof the galaxy population in the cluster and measure the average bar strength\nand bar fraction as a function of clustercentric radius. Both are found to be\nmildly decreasing functions of radius. We conclude that tidal forces can\ntrigger bar formation in cluster cores, but not in the outskirts, and thus\ncause larger concentrations of barred galaxies towards cluster center.\n", "  Two of the central problems in our understanding of the solar chromosphere\nare how the upper chromosphere is heated and what drives spicules. Estimates of\nthe required chromospheric heating, based on radiative and conductive losses\nsuggest a rate of ${\\sim} 0.1 \\mathrm{\\:erg\\:cm^{-3}\\:s^{-1}}$ in the lower\nchromosphere dropping to ${\\sim} 10^{-3} \\mathrm{\\:erg\\:cm^{-3}\\:s^{-1}}$ in\nthe upper chromosphere (\\citet{Avrett1981}). The chromosphere is also permeated\nby spicules, higher density plasma from the lower atmosphere propelled upwards\nat speeds of ${\\sim} 10-20 \\mathrm{\\:km\\:s^{-1}}$, for so called Type-I\nspicules (\\citet{Pereira2012,Zhang2012}), reaching heights of ${\\sim} 3000-5000\n\\mathrm{\\:km}$ above the photosphere. A clearer understanding of chromospheric\ndynamics, its heating and the formation of spicules, is thus of central\nimportance to solar atmospheric science. For over thirty years it has been\nproposed that photospheric driving of MHD waves may be responsible for both\nheating and spicule formation. This paper presents results from a\nhigh-resolution MHD treatment of photospheric driven Alfv\\'en and kink waves\npropagating upwards into an expanding flux tube embedded in a model\nchromospheric atmosphere. We show that the ponderomotive coupling from Alfv\\'en\nand kink waves into slow modes generates shocks which both heat the upper\nchromosphere and drive spicules. These simulations show that wave driving of\nthe solar chromosphere can give a local heating rate which matches observations\nand drive spicules consistent with Type-I observations all within a single\ncoherent model.\n", "  In this manuscript the general concepts of spin wave theory are adapted to\nthe dynamics of a self-polarized system based on two layers coupled via\ninterlayer exchange (conservative coupling) and mutual spin torque (dissipative\ncoupling). An analytical description of the non-linear dynamics is proposed and\nvalidated through numerical simulations. In contrast to the single layer model,\nthe phase equation of the coupled system has a contribution coming from the\ndissipative part of the LLGS equation. It is shown that this is a major\ncontribution to the frequency mandatory to describe well the most basic\nfeatures of the dynamics of coupled systems. Using the proposed model a\nspecific feature of coupled dynamics is addressed: the redshift to blueshift\ntransition observed in the frequency current dependence of this kind of\nexchange coupled systems upon increasing the applied field. It is found that\nthe blueshift regime can only occur in a region of field where the two linear\neigenmodes contribute equally to the steady state mode (i.e. high mode\nhybridization). Finally, a general perturbed Hamiltonian equation for the\ncoupled system is proposed.\n", "  When ultralight axion dark matter encounters a static magnetic field, it\nsources an effective electric current that follows the magnetic field lines and\noscillates at the axion Compton frequency. We propose a new experiment to\ndetect this axion effective current. In the presence of axion dark matter, a\nlarge toroidal magnet will act like an oscillating current ring, whose induced\nmagnetic flux can be measured by an external pickup loop inductively coupled to\na SQUID magnetometer. We consider both resonant and broadband readout circuits\nand show that a broadband approach has advantages at small axion masses. We\nestimate the reach of this design, taking into account the irreducible sources\nof noise, and demonstrate potential sensitivity to axion-like dark matter with\nmasses in the range of 10^{-14}-10^{-6} eV. In particular, both the broadband\nand resonant strategies can probe the QCD axion with a GUT-scale decay\nconstant.\n", "  We have studied the properties of hot and dense quark matter based on the\n3-flavor Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model as well as its Polyakov-loop extension\n(pNJL) with scalar-isovector and vector-isovector couplings. Provided a\nconsiderable large isospin asymmetry or isospin chemical potential, isospin\nsplittings of constituent mass, chiral phase transition boundary, and critical\npoint for $u$ and $d$ quarks can be observed for positive isovector coupling\nconstants but are suppressed for negative ones. The quark matter symmetry\nenergy decreases with the increasing isovector coupling constant, and is mostly\nenhanced in the pNJL model than in the NJL model. A positive scalar-isovector\ncoupling constant is more likely to lead to an unstable isospin asymmetric\nquark matter. The isovector coupling has been further found to affect particle\nfractions as well as the equation of state in hybrid stars. Possible effects on\nthe isospin properties of quark matter have also been discussed if the\nstrangeness sector is further broken among the flavor symmetry.\n", "  In this paper we explore the correspondence between four-dimensional\nBorn-Infeld theory and five-dimensional classical gravity. The Born-Infeld\ntheory side corresponds to the low energy effective theory for open strings\nending on coincident D3-branes in a (slowly varying) background Kalb-Ramond\nfield, including all higher-derivative corrections. On the gravity side one has\nthe gravitational (closed string) description of D3-branes in the same\nbackground Kalb-Ramond field and the correspondence is thus a consequence of\nthe open/closed string duality. According to the correspondence the gravity\nside provides a description of the strong coupling limit of Born-Infeld theory.\nThis is a correspondence between effective theories in a similar sense as in\nthe fluid/gravity correspondence. We match the Born-Infeld and gravity sides up\nto, and including, two-derivative corrections. To this end, we find a new\ngravity solution for D3-branes with flat embedding in the background of an\narbitrary constant background Kalb-Ramond field and show that there are no\ntwo-derivative corrections to this for a slowly varying Kalb-Ramond field.\n", "  We investigate heat transport between two thermal reservoirs that are coupled\nvia a large spin composed of N identical two level systems. One coupling\nimplements the dissipative Dicke super- radiance. The other coupling is locally\nof the pure-dephasing type and requires to go beyond the standard weak-coupling\nlimit by employing a Bogoliubov mapping in the corresponding reservoir. After\nthe mapping, the large spin is coupled to a collective mode with the original\npure-dephasing interaction, but the collective mode is dissipatively coupled to\nthe residual oscillators. Treating the large spin and the collective mode as\nthe system, a standard master equation approach is now able to capture the\nenergy transfer between the two reservoirs. Assuming fast relaxation of the\ncollective mode, we derive a coarse-grained rate equation for the large spin\nonly and discuss how the original Dicke superradiance is affected by the\npresence of the additional reservoir. Our main finding is a cooperatively\nenhanced rectification effect due to the interplay of supertransmittant heat\ncurrents (scaling quadratically with $N$) and the asymmetric coupling to both\nreservoirs. For large $N$, the system can thus significantly amplify current\nasymmetries under bias reversal, functioning as a heat diode. We also briefly\ndiscuss the case when the couplings of the collective spin are locally\ndissipative, showing that the heat-diode effect is still present.\n", "  Fully developed homogeneous isotropic turbulence in 2D is fundamentally\ndifferent from 3D. In 2D, the simultaneous conservation of both energy and\nenstrophy in the inertial ranges of scales leads to a forward cascade of\nenstrophy and a reverse cascade of energy. In 3D, helicity, the integral of the\nscalar product of velocity and vorticity, is also an inviscid flow invariant\nalong with kinetic energy. Unlike enstrophy, however, helicity does not block\nthe cascade of energy to small scales. Energy and helicity are not only\nglobally conserved but also conserved within each non-linear triadic\ninteraction between three plane waves in the spectral form of the\nNavier--Stokes equation (NSE). By decomposing each plane wave into two helical\nmodes of opposite helicities each triadic interaction is split into a set of\neight triadic interactions between helical modes (Waleffe 1992). Biferale et\nal. (2012) recently found that a subset of these interactions which render both\nsigns of helicity separately conserved (i.e. enstrophy-like) leads to an\ninverse cascade of (part of) the energy. Motivated by this finding we introduce\na new shell model obtained from the NSE expressed in the helical basis (Waleffe\n1992). By analysing and integrating the new model we attempt to explain why the\ndual forward cascade of energy and helicity dominates in 3D turbulence.\n", "  One of the main methods for protecting quantum information against\ndecoherence is to encode information in the ground subspace (or the low energy\nsector) of a Hamiltonian with a large energy gap which penalizes errors from\nenvironment. The protecting Hamiltonian is chosen such that its degenerate\nground subspace is an error detecting code for the errors caused by the\ninteraction with the environment. We consider environments with arbitrary\nnumber of local sites, e.g. spins, whose interactions among themselves are\nlocal and bounded. Then, assuming the system is interacting with a finite\nnumber of sites in the environment, we prove that, up to second order with\nrespect to the coupling constant, decoherence and relaxation are suppressed by\na factor which grows exponentially fast with the ratio of energy penalty to the\nnorm of local interactions in the environment. The state may, however, still\nevolve unitarily inside the code subspace due to the Lamb shift effect. In the\ncontext of adiabatic quantum computation, this means that the evolution inside\nthe code subspace is effectively governed by a renormalized Hamiltonian. The\nresult is derived from first principles, without use of master equations or\ntheir assumptions, and holds even in the infinite temperature limit. We also\nprove that unbounded or non-local interactions in the environment at sites far\nfrom the system do not considerably modify the exponential suppression. Our\nmain technical tool is a new bound on the decay of power spectral density at\nhigh frequencies for local observables and many-body Hamiltonians with bounded\nand local interactions in a neighborhood around the support of the observable.\n", "  In this paper we present well-posedness results of the wave equation in\n$H^{1}$ for spacetimes that contain string-like singularities. These results\nextend a framework able to characterise gravitational singularities as\nobstruction to the dynamics of test fields rather than point particles. In\nparticular, we discuss spacetimes with cosmic strings and the relation of our\nresults to the Strong Cosmic Censorship Conjecture.\n", "  We demonstrate a new approach for directly measuring the ultrafast energy\ntransfer between elec- trons and magnons, enabling us to track spin dynamics in\nan antiferromagnet (AFM). In multiferroic HoMnO3, optical photoexcitation\ncreates hot electrons, after which changes in the spin order are probed with a\nTHz pulse tuned to a magnon resonance. This reveals a photoinduced\ntransparency, which builds up over several picoseconds as the spins heat up due\nto energy transfer from hot elec- trons via phonons. This spin-lattice\nthermalization time is ?10 times faster than that of typical ferromagnetic (FM)\nmanganites. We qualitatively explain the fundamental differences in\nspin-lattice thermalization between FM and AFM systems and apply a Boltzmann\nequation model for treating AFMs. Our work gives new insight into spin-lattice\nthermalization in AFMs and demonstrates a new approach for directly monitoring\nthe ultrafast dynamics of spin order in these systems.\n", "  We consider the fluctuation-induced interaction of two thin, rod-like\nparticles or \"needles\" immersed in a two-dimensional critical fluid of Ising\nsymmetry right at the critical point. Conformally mapping the plane containing\nthe needles onto a simpler geometry in which the stress tensor is known, we\nanalyze the force and torque between needles of arbitrary length, separation,\nand orientation. For infinite and semi-infinite needles we utilize the mapping\nof the plane bounded by the needles onto the half plane, and for two needles of\nfinite length the mapping onto an annulus. For semi-infinite and infinite\nneedles the force is expressed in terms of elementary functions, and we also\nobtain analytical results for the force and torque between needles of finite\nlength with separation much greater than their length. Evaluating formulas in\nour approach numerically for several needle geometries and surface universality\nclasses, we study the full crossover from small to large values of the\nseparation to length ratio. In these two limits the numerical results agree\nwith results for infinitely long needles and with predictions of the\nsmall-particle operator expansion, respectively.\n", "  We derive an energy conservation law for the system of gravitational\nperturbations on the Schwarzschild spacetime expressed in a double null gauge.\nThe resulting identity involves only first derivatives of the metric\nperturbation. Exploiting the gauge invariance up to boundary terms of the\nfluxes that appear, we are able to establish positivity of the flux on any\noutgoing null hypersurface to the future of the initial data. This allows us to\nbound the total energy flux through any such hypersurface, including the event\nhorizon, in terms of initial data. We similarly bound the total energy radiated\nto null infinity. Our estimates provide a direct approach to a weak form of\nstability, thereby complementing the proof of the full linear stability of the\nSchwarzschild solution recently obtained in [M. Dafermos, G. Holzegel and I.\nRodnianski \\emph{The linear stability of the Schwarzschild solution to\ngravitational perturbations}, arXiv:1601.06467].\n", "  Cliques are frequently used to model communities: a community is a set of\nnodes where each pair is equally likely to be connected. But studying\nreal-world communities reveals that they have more structure than that. In\nparticular, the nodes can be ordered in such a way that (almost) all edges in\nthe community lie below a hyperbola. In this paper we present three new models\nfor communities that capture this phenomenon. Our models explain the structure\nof the communities differently, but we also prove that they are identical in\ntheir expressive power. Our models fit to real-world data much better than\ntraditional block models or previously-proposed hyperbolic models, both of\nwhich are a special case of our model. Our models also allow for intuitive\ninterpretation of the parameters, enabling us to summarize the shapes of the\ncommunities in graphs effectively.\n", "  In this review we argue for the creation of a physics of moving systems -- a\nlocomotion \"robophysics\" -- which we define as the pursuit of the discovery of\nprinciples of self generated motion. Robophysics can provide an important\nintellectual complement to the discipline of robotics, largely the domain of\nresearchers from engineering and computer science. The essential idea is that\nwe must complement study of complex robots in complex situations with\nsystematic study of simplified robophysical devices in controlled laboratory\nsettings and simplified theoretical models. We must thus use the methods of\nphysics to examine successful and failed locomotion in simplified (abstracted)\ndevices using parameter space exploration, systematic control, and techniques\nfrom dynamical systems. Using examples from our and other's research, we will\ndiscuss how such robophysical studies have begun to aid engineers in the\ncreation of devices that begin to achieve life-like locomotor abilities on and\nwithin complex environments, have inspired interesting physics questions in low\ndimensional dynamical systems, geometric mechanics and soft matter physics, and\nhave been useful to develop models for biological locomotion in complex\nterrain. The rapidly decreasing cost of constructing sophisticated robot models\nwith easy access to significant computational power bodes well for scientists\nand engineers to engage in a discipline which can readily integrate experiment,\ntheory and computation.\n", "  Based on a vector triplet model we study a possible failure of dimension-6\noperators in describing LHC Higgs kinematics. First, we illustrate that\nincluding dimension-6 contributions squared can significantly improve the\nagreement between the full model and the dimension-6 approximation, both in\nassociated Higgs production and in weak-boson-fusion Higgs production. Second,\nwe test how a simplified model with an additional heavy scalar could improve\nthe agreement in critical LHC observables. In weak boson fusion we find an\nimprovement for virtuality-related observables at large energies, but at the\ncost of sizeable deviations in interference patterns and angular correlations.\n", "  Recent observations of the L2 Puppis system suggest that this Mira-like\nvariable may be in the early stages of forming a bipolar planetary nebula (PN).\nAs one of nearest and brightest AGB stars, thought be a binary, L2 Puppis\nserves as a benchmark object for studying the late-stages of stellar evolution.\nWe perform global, three-dimensional, adaptive-mesh-refinement hydrodynamic\nsimulations of the L2 Puppis system with AstroBEAR. We use the radiative\ntransfer code RADMC-3D to construct the broad-band spectral-energy-distribution\n(SED) and synthetic observational images from our simulations. Given the\nreported binary parameters, we are able to reproduce the current observational\ndata if a short pulse of dense material is released from the AGB star with a\nvelocity sufficient to escape the primary but not the binary. Such a situation\ncould result from a thermal pulse, be induced by a periastron passage of the\nsecondary, or could be launched if the primary ingests a planet.\n", "  Symmetries constrain dynamics. We test this fundamental physical principle,\nexperimentally and by molecular dynamics simulations, for a hot Janus swimmer\noperating far from thermal equilibrium. Our results establish scalar and\nvectorial steady-state fluctuation theorems and a thermodynamic uncertainty\nrelation that link the fluctuating particle current to its entropy production\nat an effective temperature. A Markovian minimal model elucidates the\nunderlying non-equilbrium physics.\n", "  We define the theoretical framework and deduce the conditions under which\nmulti-messenger astronomy can provide useful information about neutrino masses\nand their ordering. The framework uses time differences between the arrival of\nneutrinos and the other light messenger, i.e. the graviton, emitted in\nastrophysical catastrophes. We also provide a preliminary feasibility study\nelucidating the experimental reach and challenges for planned neutrino\ndetectors such as Hyper-Kamiokande as well as future several megaton detectors.\nThis study shows that future experiments can be useful in testing independently\nthe cosmological bounds on absolute neutrino masses. Concretely the success of\nsuch measurements depends crucially on the available rate of astrophysical\nevents and further requires development of high resolution timing besides the\nadvocated need of megaton size detectors.\n", "  We present a thorough density functional theory study of the magneto-electric\n(ME) effect in Cr$_{2}$O$_{3}$. The spin-lattice ME tensor $\\alpha$ was\ndetermined in the low-field and spin flop (SF) phases, using the method of\ndynamical magnetic charges, and found to be the sum of three distinct\ncomponents. Two of them, a large relativistic \"cycloidal\" term and a small\nlongitudinal term, are independent on the spin orientation. The third, only\nactive in the SF phases is also of relativistic origin and arises from\nmagnetic-field-induced chirality, leading to a non-toroidal ME response.\n", "  Magnetic skyrmions have attracted broad attention during recent years because\nthey are regarded as promising candidates as bits of information in novel data\nstorage devices. A broad range of theoretical and experimental investigations\nhave been conducted with the consideration of rotational symmetric skyrmions in\nisotropic environments. However, one naturally observes a huge variety of\nanisotropic behavior in many experimentally relevant materials. In the present\nwork, we investigate the influence of anisotropic environments onto the\nformation and behavior of the non-collinear spin states of skyrmionic materials\nby means of Monte-Carlo calculations. We find skyrmionic textures which are far\nfrom having a rotational symmetric shape. Furthermore, we show the possibility\nto employ periodic modulations of the environment to create skyrmionic tracks.\n", "  [Abridged] Star and planet formation are the complex outcomes of\ngravitational collapse and angular momentum transport mediated by protostellar\nand protoplanetary disks. In this review we focus on the role of gravitational\ninstability in this process. We begin with a brief overview of the\nobservational evidence for massive disks that might be subject to gravitational\ninstability, and then highlight the diverse ways in which the instability\nmanifests itself in protostellar and protoplanetary disks: the generation of\nspiral arms, small scale turbulence-like density fluctuations, and\nfragmentation of the disk itself. We present the analytic theory that describes\nthe linear growth phase of the instability, supplemented with a survey of\nnumerical simulations that aim to capture the non-linear evolution. We\nemphasize the role of thermodynamics and large scale infall in controlling the\noutcome of the instability. Despite apparent controversies in the literature,\nwe show a remarkable level of agreement between analytic predictions and\nnumerical results. We highlight open questions related to (1) the development\nof a turbulent cascade in thin disks, and (2) the role of mode-mode coupling in\nsetting the maximum angular momentum transport rate in thick disks.\n", "  Non-aligning self-propelled particles with purely repulsive excluded volume\ninteractions undergo athermal motility-induced phase separation into a dilute\ngas and a dense cluster phase. Here, we use enhanced sampling computational\nmethods and analytic theory to examine the kinetics of formation of the dense\nphase. Despite the intrinsically nonequilibrium nature of the phase transition,\nwe show that the kinetics can be described using an approach analogous to\nequilibrium classical nucleation theory, governed by an effective free energy\nof cluster formation with identifiable bulk and surface terms. The theory\ncaptures the location of the binodal, nucleation rates as a function of\nsupersaturation, and the cluster size distributions below the binodal, while\ndiscrepancies in the metastable region reveal additional physics about the\nearly stages of active crystal formation. The success of the theory shows that\na framework similar to equilibrium thermodynamics can be obtained directly from\nthe microdynamics of an active system, and can be used to describe the kinetics\nof evolution toward nonequilibrium steady states.\n", "  The approximation of a high-dimensional vector by a small combination of\ncolumn vectors selected from a fixed matrix has been actively debated in\nseveral different disciplines. In this paper, a sampling approach based on the\nMonte Carlo method is presented as an efficient solver for such problems.\nEspecially, the use of simulated annealing (SA), a metaheuristic optimization\nalgorithm, for determining degrees of freedom (the number of used columns) by\ncross validation is focused on and tested. Test on a synthetic model indicates\nthat our SA-based approach can find a nearly optimal solution for the\napproximation problem and, when combined with the CV framework, it can optimize\nthe generalization ability. Its utility is also confirmed by application to a\nreal-world supernova data set.\n", "  After the jets have switched off, radio galaxies undergo a fading phase which\nis often named the dying phase. The luminosity evolution of the remnant plasma\nduring this period is still poorly constrained because of the paucity of\nobjects detected. Using the new 150-MHz deep LOFAR observations of the\nwell-known extragalactic field the Lockman Hole, we performed a systematic\nsearch of dying radio sources aiming to provide good statistics on their\ndetection and properties. To avoid selection biases towards any specific class\nof dying sources we used both morphological and spectral selection criteria. To\ndo this we combined the LOFAR data with publicly available surveys at other\nfrequencies as well as dedicated deep observations. Our preliminary results,\nshow that the fraction of candidate dying radio sources is < 6-8% of the entire\nradio source population and is dominated by steep spectrum sources. By\ncomparing these observational results with statistical modelling of the radio\nsky population we will be able to constrain the main mechanisms contributing to\nthe dying radio galaxy luminosity evolution.\n", "  We have studied the crystal and magnetic structures of Fe-doped hexagonal\nmanganites LuMn1-xFexO3 (x = 0, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3) by using bulk magnetization\nand neutron powder diffraction methods. The samples crystalize consistently in\na hexagonal structure and maintain the space group P63cm from 2 to 300 K. The\nN\\'eel temperature TN increases continuously with increasing Fe-doping. In\ncontrast to a single {\\Gamma}4 representation in LuMnO3, the magnetic ground\nstate of the Fe-doped samples can only be described with a spin configuration\ndescribed by a mixture of {\\Gamma}3 (P63'cm') and {\\Gamma}4 (P63'c'm)\nrepresentations, whose contributions have been quantitatively estimated. The\ndrastic effect of Fe-doping is highlighted by composition-dependent spin\nreorientations. A phase diagram of the entire composition series is proposed\nbased on the present results and those reported in literature. Our result\ndemonstrates the importance of tailoring compositions in increasing magnetic\ntransition temperatures of multiferroic systems.\n", "  We discuss the emergence of classical trajectories in Bohmian Mechanics (BM),\nwhen a macroscopic object interacts with an external environment. We show that\nin such a case the conditional wave function of the system follows a dynamics\nwhich, under reasonable assumptions, corresponds to that of the\nGhirardi-Rimini-Weber (GRW) collapse model. As a consequence, Bohmian\ntrajectories evolve classically. Our analysis also shows how the GRW\n(istantaneous) collapse process can be derived by an underlying continuous\ninteraction of a quantum system with an external agent, thus throwing a light\non how collapses can emerge from a deeper level theory.\n", "  We summarize our current knowledge of neutron star masses and radii. Recent\ninstrumentation and computational advances have resulted in a rapid increase in\nthe discovery rate and precise timing of radio pulsars in binaries in the last\nfew years, leading to a large number of mass measurements. These discoveries\nshow that the neutron star mass distribution is much wider than previously\nthought, with 3 known pulsars now firmly in the 1.9-2.0 Msun mass range. For\nradii, large, high quality datasets from X-ray satellites as well as\nsignificant progress in theoretical modeling led to considerable progress in\nthe measurements, placing them in the 9.9-11.2 km range and shrinking their\nuncertainties due to a better understanding of the sources of systematic\nerrors. The combination of the massive neutron star discoveries, the tighter\nradius measurements, and improved laboratory constraints of the properties of\ndense matter has already made a substantial impact on our understanding of the\ncomposition and bulk properties of cold nuclear matter at densities higher than\nthat of the atomic nucleus, a major unsolved problem in modern physics.\n", "  We present a method to optimize qubit control parameters during error\ndetection which is compatible with large-scale qubit arrays. We demonstrate our\nmethod to optimize single or two-qubit gates in parallel on a nine-qubit\nsystem. Additionally, we show how parameter drift can be compensated for during\ncomputation by inserting a frequency drift and using our method to remove it.\nWe remove both drift on a single qubit and independent drifts on all qubits\nsimultaneously. We believe this method will be useful in keeping error rates\nlow on all physical qubits throughout the course of a computation. Our method\nis O(1) scalable to systems of arbitrary size, providing a path towards\ncontrolling the large numbers of qubits needed for a fault-tolerant quantum\ncomputer\n", "  DXL (Diffuse X-ray emission from the Local Galaxy) is a sounding rocket\nmission designed to estimate the contribution of Solar Wind Charge eXchange\n(SWCX) to the Diffuse X-ray Background (DXB) and to help determine the\nproperties of the Local Hot Bubble (LHB). The detectors are large-area\nthin-window proportional counters with a spectral response similar to that of\nthe PSPC used in the ROSAT All Sky Survey (RASS). A direct comparison of DXL\nand RASS data for the same part of the sky viewed from quite different vantage\npoints in the Solar system and the assumption of approximate isotropy for the\nSolar wind allowed us to quantify the SWCX contribution to all 6 RASS bands\n(R1-R7, excepting R3). We find that the SWCX contribution at l=140 deg, b=0\ndeg, where the DXL path crosses the Galactic plane is 33%+-6%\n(statistical)+-12%(systematic) for R1, 44%+-\\%+-5% for R2, 18%+-12%+-11% for\nR4, 14%+-11%+-9% for R5, and negligible for R6 and R7 bands. Reliable models\nfor the distribution of neutral H and He in the Solar system permit estimation\nof the contribution of interplanetary SWCX emission over the the whole sky and\ncorrection of the RASS maps. We find that the average SWCX contribution in the\nwhole sky is 26%+-6%+-13% for R1, 30%+-4%+-4% for R2, 8%+-5%+-5% for R4,\n6%+-4%+-4% for R5, and negligible for R6 and R7.\n", "  The dynamo action achieved in the convective cores of main-sequence massive\nstars is explored here through 3D global simulations of convective core dynamos\noperating within a young $\\Msun{10}$ B-type star, using the anelastic spherical\nharmonic (ASH) code. These simulations capture the inner 65\\% of this star by\nradius, encompassing the convective nuclear-burning core (about 23\\% by radius)\nand a portion of the overlying radiative envelope. Eight rotation rates are\nconsidered, ranging from 0.05\\% to 16\\% of the surface breakup velocity,\nthereby capturing both convection that barely senses the effects of rotation\nand other situations in which the Coriolis forces are prominent. The vigorous\ndynamo action realized within all of these turbulent convective cores builds\nmagnetic fields with peak strengths exceeding a megagauss, with the overall\nmagnetic energy (ME) in the faster rotators reaching super-equipartition levels\ncompared to the convective kinetic energy (KE). The core convection typically\ninvolves turbulent columnar velocity structures roughly aligned with the\nrotation axis, with magnetic fields threading through these rolls and\npossessing complex linkages throughout the core. The very strong fields are\nable to coexist with the flows without quenching them through Lorentz forces.\nThe velocity and magnetic fields achieve such a state by being nearly\nco-aligned, and with peak magnetic islands being somewhat displaced from the\nfastest flows as the intricate evolution proceeds. As the rotation rate is\nincreased, the primary force balance shifts from nonlinear advection balancing\nLorentz forces to a magnetostrophic balance between Coriolis and Lorentz\nforces.\n", "  Entangled states are a crucial resource for quantum-based technologies such\nas quantum computers and quantum communication systems (1,2). Exploring new\nmethods for entanglement generation is important for diversifying and\neventually improving current approaches. Here, we create entanglement in atomic\nions by applying laser fields to constrain the evolution to a restricted number\nof states, in an approach that has become known as \"quantum Zeno dynamics\"\n(3-5). With two trapped $^9\\rm{Be}^+$ ions, we obtain Bell state fidelities up\nto $0.990^{+2}_{-5}$, with three ions, a W-state (6) fidelity of\n$0.910^{+4}_{-7}$ is obtained. Compared to other methods of producing\nentanglement in trapped ions, this procedure is relatively insensitive to\ncertain imperfections such as fluctuations in laser intensity, laser frequency,\nand ion-motion frequencies.\n", "  Simultaneous space- and ground-based microlensing surveys, such as K2's\nCampaign 9 (K2C9) and $WFIRST$, facilitate measuring the masses and distances\nof free-floating planet (FFP) candidates. FFPs are identified as single-lens\nevents with a short timescale, of-order 1 day. Measuring the mass of the\nlensing object requires determining the finite size of the source star $\\rho$,\nas well as the microlens parallax $\\pi_{\\rm E}$. A planet that is bound to but\nwidely separated from a host star can produce a light curve similar to that of\nan FFP. This tension can be resolved with high-resolution imaging of the\nmicrolensing target to search for the lens flux $F_l$ from a possible host\nstar. Here we investigate the accessible parameter space for each of these\ncomponents --- $\\pi_{\\rm E}$, $\\rho$, and $F_l$ --- considering different\nsatellites for a range of FFP masses, Galactic distances, and source star\nproperties. We find that at the beginning of K2C9, when its projected\nseparation from the Earth (as viewed from the center of its survey field) is\n$\\lesssim$0.2 AU, it will be able to measure $\\pi_{\\rm E}$ for Jupiter-mass FFP\ncandidates at distances larger than $\\sim$2 kpc and to Earth-mass lenses at\n$\\sim$8 kpc. At the end of its campaign, when $D_\\perp = 0.81$ AU, it is\nsensitive to planetary-mass lenses for distances $\\gtrsim$3.5 kpc, and even\nthen only to those with mass $\\gtrsim$M$_{\\rm Jup}$. From lens flux constraints\nwe find that it will be possible to exclude all stellar-mass host stars (down\nto the deuterium-burning limit) for events within $\\sim$2 kpc. Together these\nindicate that the ability to characterize FFPs detected during K2C9 is\noptimized for events occurring toward the beginning of the campaign. $WFIRST$,\non the other hand, will be able to detect and characterize FFPs with masses at\nleast as low as super-Earths throughout the Galaxy during its entire\nmicrolensing survey.\n", "  We present novel, analytical, equilibrium-chemistry formulae for the\nabundances of molecules in hot exoplanetary atmospheres that include the\ncarbon, oxygen and nitrogen networks. Our hydrogen-dominated solutions involve\nacetylene (C$_2$H$_2$), ammonia (NH$_3$), carbon dioxide (CO$_2$), carbon\nmonoxide (CO), ethylene (C$_2$H$_4$), hydrogen cyanide (HCN), methane (CH$_4$),\nmolecular nitrogen (N$_2$) and water (H$_2$O). By considering only the gas\nphase, we prove that the mixing ratio of carbon monoxide is governed by a decic\nequation (polynomial equation of degree 10). We validate our solutions against\nnumerical calculations of equilibrium chemistry that perform Gibbs free energy\nminimization and demonstrate that they are accurate at the $\\sim 1\\%$ level for\ntemperatures from 500 to 3000 K. In hydrogen-dominated atmospheres, the ratio\nof abundances of HCN to CH$_4$ is nearly constant across a wide range of\ncarbon-to-oxygen ratios, which makes it a robust diagnostic of the metallicity\nin the gas phase. Our validated formulae allow for the convenient benchmarking\nof chemical kinetics codes and provide an efficient way of enforcing chemical\nequilibrium in atmospheric retrieval calculations.\n", "  The numerical simulation of turbulence in stars has led to a rich set of\npossibilities regarding stellar pulsations, asteroseismology, thermonuclear\nyields, and formation of neutron stars and black holes. The breaking of\nsymmetry by turbulent flow grows in amplitude as collapse is approached, which\ninsures that the conditions at the onset of collapse are not spherical. This\nlack of spherical symmetry has important implications for the mechanism of\nexplosion and ejected nucleosynthesis products. Numerical resolution of several\ndifferent types of three--dimensional (3D) stellar simulations are compared; it\nis suggested that core collapse simulations may be under-resolved.\n  New physical effects which appear in 3D are summarized.\n  Connections between simulations of progenitor explosion and observations of\nsupernova remnants (SNR) are discussed.\n  Present treatment of boundaries, for mixing regions during He--burning,\nrequires revision.\n", "  We study the composition of the faint radio population selected from the\nVLA-COSMOS 3GHz Large Project, a radio continuum survey performed at 10 cm\nwavelength. The survey covers the full 2 square degree COSMOS field with mean\n$rms\\sim2.3$ $\\mu$Jy/beam, cataloging 10,899 source components above $5\\times\nrms$. By combining these radio data with UltraVISTA, optical, near-infrared,\nand Spitzer/IRAC mid-infrared data, as well as X-ray data from the Chandra\nLegacy, and Chandra COSMOS surveys, we gain insight into the emission\nmechanisms within our radio sources out to redshifts of $z\\sim5$. From these\nemission characteristics we classify our souces as star forming galaxies or\nAGN. Using their multi-wavelength properties we further separate the AGN into\nsub-samples dominated by radiatively efficient and inefficient AGN, often\nreferred to as high- and low-excitation emission line AGN. We compare our\nmethod with other results based on fitting of the sources' spectral energy\ndistributions using both galaxy and AGN spectral models, and those based on the\ninfrared-radio correlation. We study the fractional contributions of these\nsub-populations down to radio flux levels of $\\sim$10 $\\mu$Jy. We find that at\n3 GHz flux densities above $\\sim$400 $\\mu$Jy quiescent, red galaxies,\nconsistent with the low-excitation radio AGN class constitute the dominant\nfraction. Below densities of $\\sim$200 $\\mu$Jy star-forming galaxies begin to\nconstitute the largest fraction, followed by the low-excitation, and X-ray- and\nIR-identified high-excitation radio AGN.\n", "  Some unexpected features of the phase diagram of the monoaxial helimagnet in\npresence of an applied magnetic field perpendicular to the chiral axis are\ntheoretically predicted. A rather general hamiltonian with long range\nHeisenberg exchange and Dzyaloshinskii--Moriya interactions is considered. The\ncontinuum limit simplifies the free energy, which contains only a few\nparameters which in principle are determined by the many parameters of the\nhamiltonian, although in practice they may be tuned to fit the experiments. The\nphase diagram contains a Chiral Soliton Lattice phase and a forced\nferromagnetic phase separated by a line of phase transitions, which are of\nsecond order at low T and of first order in the vicinity of the zero-field\nordering temperature, and are separated by a tricritical point. A highly non\nlinear Chiral Soliton Lattice, in which many harmonics contribute appreciably\nto the spatial modulation of the local magnetic moment, develops only below the\ntricritical temperature, and in this case the scaling shows a logarithmic\nbehaviour similar to that at T=0, which is a universal feature of the Chiral\nSoliton Lattice. Below the tricritical temperature, the normalized soliton\ndensity curves are found to be independent of T, in agreement with the\nexperimental results of magnetorresistance curves, while above the tricritical\ntemperature they show a noticeable temperature dependence. The implications in\nthe interpretation of experimental results of CrNb3S6 are discussed.\n", "  The square lattice antiferromagnet with frustrating next nearest neighbour\ncoupling continues to generate tremendous interest, with an elusive quantum\ndisordered phase in the vicinity of $J_2$ = $J_1$/2. At this precise value of\nfrustration, the classical model has a very large degeneracy which makes the\nproblem difficult to handle. We show that introducing a ferromagnetic $J_3$\ncoupling partially lifts this degeneracy. It gives rise to a four-site magnetic\nunit cell with the constraint that the spins on every square must add to zero.\nThis leads to a two-parameter family of ground states and an emergent vector\norder parameter. We reinterpret this family of ground states as coexistence\nstates of three spirals. Using spin wave analysis, we show that thermal and\nquantum fluctuations break this degeneracy differently. Thermal fluctuations\nbreak it down to a threefold degeneracy with a N\\'eel phase and two stripe\nphases. This threefold symmetry is restored via a $Z_3$ thermal transition, as\nwe demonstrate using classical Monte Carlo simulations. On the other hand,\nquantum fluctuations select the N\\'eel state. In the extreme quantum limit of\nspin-$1/2$, we use exact diagonalization to demonstrate N\\'eel ordering beyond\na critical $J_3$ coupling. For weak $J_3$, a variational approach suggests an\n$s$-wave plaquette-RVB state. Away from the $J_2 = J_1/2$ line, we show that\nquantum fluctuations favour N\\'eel ordering strongly enough to stabilize it\nwithin the classical stripe region. Our results shed light on the origin of the\nquantum disordered phase in the $J_1$-$J_2$ model.\n", "  We observe and study the phenomenon of Anderson localization in a system of\ntrue quantum kicked rotors. Nitrogen molecules in a supersonic molecular jet\nare cooled down to 27~K and are rotationally excited by a periodic train of\n24~high-intensity femtosecond pulses. Exponential distribution of the molecular\nangular momentum - the most unambiguous signature of Anderson localization - is\nmeasured directly by means of coherent Raman scattering. We demonstrate the\nsuppressed growth of the molecular rotational energy with the number of laser\nkicks and study the dependence of the localization length on the kick strength.\nBoth timing and amplitude noise in the pulse train is shown to destroy the\nlocalization and revive the diffusive growth of angular momentum.\n", "  Recent developments in searches for dark-matter candidates with atomic clocks\nare reviewed. The intended audience is the atomic clock community.\n", "  We present two results which combined enable one to reliably detect\nmultimode, multipartite entanglement in the presence of measurement errors. The\nfirst result leads to a method to compute the best (approximated) physical\ncovariance matrix given a measured non-physical one. The other result states\nthat a widely used entanglement condition is a consequence of negativity of\npartial transposition. Our approach can quickly verify entanglement of\nexperimentally obtained multipartite states, which is demonstrated on several\nrealistic examples. Compared to existing detection schemes, ours is very simple\nand efficient. In particular, it does not require any complicated\noptimizations.\n", "  We present a microscopic theory of the chiral one-dimensional electron gas\nsystem localized on the sidewalls of magnetically-doped Bi$_2$Se$_3$-family\ntopological insulator nanoribbons in the quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE)\nregime. Our theory is based on a simple continuum model of sidewall states\nwhose parameters are extracted from detailed ribbon and film geometry\ntight-binding model calculations. In contrast to the familiar case of the\nquantum Hall effect in semiconductor quantum wells, the number of microscopic\nchiral channels depends simply and systematically on the ribbon thickness and\non the position of the Fermi level within the surface state gap. We use our\ntheory to interpret recent transport experiments that exhibit non-zero\nlongitudinal resistance in samples with accurately quantized Hall conductances.\n", "  The early rise of Type IIP supernovae (SN IIP) provides important information\nfor constraining the properties of their progenitors. This can in turn be\ncompared to pre-explosion imaging constraints and stellar models to develop a\nmore complete picture of how massive stars evolve and end their lives. Using\nthe SuperNova Explosion Code (SNEC), we model the first 40 days of SNe IIP to\nbetter understand what constraints can be derived from their early light\ncurves. We use two sets of red supergiant progenitor models with zero-age main\nsequence masses in the range between 9 Msol and 20 Msol. We find that the early\nproperties of the light curve depend most sensitively on the radius of the\nprogenitor, and thus provide a relation between the g-band rise time and the\nradius at the time of explosion. This relation will be useful for deriving\nconstraints on progenitors from future observations, especially in cases where\ndetailed modeling of the entire rise is not practical. When comparing to\nobserved rise times, the radii we find are a factor of a few larger than\nprevious semi-analytic derivations and generally in better agreement with what\nis found with current stellar evolution calculations.\n", "  An improved thermodynamic cycle is proposed, where the cooling effect of an\nelectrocaloric refrigerant is enhanced by applying a reversed electric field.\nIn contrast to conventional adiabatic heating or cooling by on-off cycles of\nthe external electric field, applying a reversed field is significantly\nimproving the cooling efficiency, since the variation in configurational\nentropy is increased. By comparing results from computer simulations using\nMonte-Carlo algorithms and experiments using direct electrocaloric\nmeasurements, we show that the electrocaloric cooling efficiency can be\nenhanced by more than 20\\% in standard ferroelectrics and also relaxor\nferroelectrics, like Pb(Mg$_{1/3}$/Nb$_{2/3}$)$_{0.71}$Ti$_{0.29}$O$_3$.\n", "  Tantalum arsenide is a member of the non-centrosymmetric monopnictides, which\nare putative Weyl semimetals. In these materials, three-dimensional chiral\nmassless quasiparticles, the so-called Weyl fermions, are predicted to induce\nnovel quantum mechanical phenomena, such as the chiral anomaly and topological\nsurface states. However, their chirality is only well-defined if the Fermi\nlevel is close enough to the Weyl points that separate Fermi surface pockets of\nopposite chirality exist. In this article, we present the bulk Fermi surface\ntopology of high quality single crystals of TaAs, as determined by\nangle-dependent Shubnikov-de Haas and de Haas-van Alphen measurements combined\nwith ab-initio band-structure calculations. Quantum oscillations originating\nfrom three different types of Fermi surface pocket were found in magnetization,\nmagnetic torque, and mag- netoresistance measurements performed in magnetic\nfields up to 14 T and temperatures down to 1.8 K. Of these Fermi pockets, two\nare pairs of topologically non-trivial electron pockets around the Weyl points\nand one is a trivial hole pocket. Unlike the other members of the\nnon-centrosymmetric monopnictides, TaAs is the first Weyl semimetal candidate\nwith the Fermi energy suffciently close to both types of Weyl points to\ngenerate chiral quasiparticles at the Fermi surface.\n", "  Resonant inelastic x-ray scattering is used to investigate the electronic\norigin of orbital polarization in nickelate heterostructures taking\n$\\mathrm{LaTiO_3-LaNiO_3-3x(LaAlO_3)}$, a system with exceptionally large\npolarization, as a model system. We find that heterostructuring generates only\nminor changes in the Ni $3d$ orbital energy levels, contradicting the\noften-invoked picture in which changes in orbital energy levels generate\norbital polarization. Instead, O $K$-edge x-ray absorption spectroscopy\ndemonstrates that orbital polarization is caused by an anisotropic\nreconstruction of the oxygen ligand hole states. This provides an explanation\nfor the limited success of theoretical predictions based on tuning orbital\nenergy levels and implies that future theories should focus on anisotropic\nhybridization as the most effective means to drive large changes in electronic\nstructure and realize novel emergent phenomena.\n", "  A density functional theory study of NbSe$_2$ single-layers in the normal\nnon-modulated and the $3\\times3$ CDW states is reported. We show that, in the\nsingle layer, the CDW barely affects the Fermi surface of the system, thus\nruling out a nesting mechanism as the driving force for the modulation. The CDW\nstabilizes levels lying around 1.5 eV below the Fermi level within the Se-based\nvalence band but having a substantial Nb-Nb bonding character. The absence of\ninterlayer interactions leads to the suppression of the pancake-like portion of\nthe bulk Fermi surface in the single-layer. We perform scanning tunneling\nmicroscopy simulations and find that the images noticeably change with the sign\nand magnitude of the voltage bias. The atomic corrugation of the Se sublayer\ninduced by the modulation plays a primary role in leading to these images, but\nthe electronic reorganization also has an important contribution. The analysis\nof the variation of these images with the bias voltage does not support a Fermi\nsurface nesting mechanism for the CDW. It is also shown that underlying\ngraphene layers (present in some of the recent experimental work) do not modify\nthe conduction band, but do affect the shape of the valence band of NbSe$_2$\nsingle-layers. The relevance of these results in understanding recent physical\nmeasurements for NbSe$_2$ single-layers is discussed.\n", "  There is evidence that magnetized material along the line of sight to distant\nquasars is detectable in the polarization properties of the background sources.\nThe polarization properties appear to be correlated with the presence of\nintervening MgII absorption, which is thought to arise in outflowing material\nfrom star forming galaxies. In order to investigate this further, we have\nobtained high spectral resolution polarization measurements, with the VLA and\nATCA, of a set of 49 unresolved quasars for which we have high quality optical\nspectra. These enable us to produce a Faraday Depth spectrum for each source,\nusing Rotation Measure Synthesis. Our new independent radio data confirms that\ninterveners are strongly associated with depolarization. We characterize the\ncomplexity of the Faraday Depth spectrum using a number of parameters and show\nhow these are related, or not, to the depolarization and to the presence of\nMgII absorption along the line of sight. We argue that complexity and structure\nin the Faraday Depth distribution likely arise from both intervening material\nand intrinsically to the background source and attempt to separate these. We\nfind that the strong radio depolarization effects associated with intervening\nmaterial at redshifts out to $z \\approx 1$ arise from inhomogeneous Faraday\nscreens producing a dispersion in Rotation Measure across individual sources of\naround 10~rad/m$^2$. This is likely produced by disordered fields with\nstrengths of at least $3\\;\\mu$G.\n", "  The problem of estimating an unknown phase $ \\varphi $ using two-level probes\nin the presence of unital phase-covariant noise and using finite resources is\ninvestigated. We introduce a simple model in which the phase-imprinting\noperation on the probes is realized by a unitary transformation with a randomly\nsampled generator. We determine the optimal phase sensitivity in a sequential\nestimation protocol, and derive a general (tight-fitting) lower bound. The\nsensitivity grows quadratically with the number of applications $ N $ of the\nphase-imprinting operation, then attains a maximum at some $ N_\\text{opt} $,\nand eventually decays to zero. We provide an estimate of $ N_\\text{opt} $ in\nterms of accessible geometric properties of the noise and illustrate its\nusefulness as a guideline for optimizing the estimation protocol. The use of\npassive ancillas and of entangled probes in parallel to improve the phase\nsensitivity is also considered. We find that multi-probe entanglement may offer\nno practical advantage over single-probe coherence if the interrogation at the\noutput is restricted to measuring local observables.\n", "  Supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) at sub-parsec separations should be\ncommon in galactic nuclei, as a result of frequent galaxy mergers.\nHydrodynamical simulations of circumbinary discs predict strong periodic\nmodulation of the mass accretion rate on time-scales comparable to the orbital\nperiod of the binary. As a result, SMBHBs may be recognized by the periodic\nmodulation of their brightness. We conducted a statistical search for periodic\nvariability in a sample of 35,383 spectroscopically confirmed quasars in the\nphotometric database of the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF). We analysed\nLomb-Scargle periodograms and assessed the significance of our findings by\nmodeling each individual quasar's variability as a damped random walk (DRW). We\nidentified 50 quasars with significant periodicity beyond the DRW model,\ntypically with short periods of a few hundred days. We find 33 of these to\nremain significant after a re-analysis of their periodograms including\nadditional optical data from the intermediate-PTF and the Catalina Real-Time\nTransient Survey (CRTS). Assuming that the observed periods correspond to the\nredshifted orbital periods of SMBHBs, we conclude that our findings are\nconsistent with a population of unequal-mass SMBHBs, with a typical mass ratio\nas low as q = M2/M1 ~ 0.01.\n", "  We consider determination of spin-orbit (SO) coupling constants for the\ntwo-dimensional electron gas from measurements of electric properties in\nrotated in-plane magnetic field. %Due to the interplay Due to the SO coupling\nthe electron backscattering is accompanied by spin precession and spin mixing\nof the incident and reflected electron waves. The competition of the external\nand SO-related magnetic fields produces a characteristic conductance dependence\non the in-plane magnetic field value and orientation which, in turn, allows for\ndetermination of the absolute value of the effective spin-orbit coupling\nconstant as well as the ratio of the Rashba and Dresselhaus SO contributions.\n", "  The recent discovery of the unidentified emission line at 3.55 keV in\ngalaxies and clusters has attracted great interest from the community. As the\norigin of the line remains uncertain, we study the surface brightness\ndistribution of the line in the Perseus cluster since that information can be\nused to identify its origin. We examine the flux distribution of the 3.55 keV\nline in the deep Suzaku observations of the Perseus cluster in detail. The 3.55\nkeV line is observed in three concentric annuli in the central observations,\nalthough the observations of the outskirts of the cluster did not reveal such a\nsignal. We establish that these detections and the upper limits from the\nnon-detections are consistent with a dark matter decay origin. However, absence\nof positive detection in the outskirts is also consistent with some unknown\nastrophysical origin of the line in the dense gas of the Perseus core, as well\nas with a dark matter origin with a steeper dependence on mass than the dark\nmatter decay. We also comment on several recently published analyses of the\n3.55 keV line.\n", "  Lyman-$\\alpha$ nebulae are usually found in massive environments at high\nredshift ($z > 2$). The origin of their Lyman-$\\alpha$ (Lya) emission remains\ndebated. Recent polarimetric observations showed that at least some Lya sources\nare polarized. This is often interpreted as a proof that the photons are\ncentrally produced, and opposed to the scenario in which the Lya emission is\nthe cooling radiation emitted by gas heated during the accretion onto the halo.\nWe suggest that this scenario is not incompatible with the polarimetric\nobservations. In order to test this idea, we post-process a radiative\nhydrodynamics simulation of a blob with the MCLya Monte Carlo transfer code. We\ncompute radial profiles for the surface brightness and the degree of\npolarization and compare them to existing observations. We find that both are\nconsistent with a significant contribution of the extragalactic gas to the Lya\nemission. Most of the photons are centrally emitted and scattered inside the\nfilament afterwards, producing the observed high level of polarization. We\nargue that the contribution of the extragalactic gas to the Lya emission does\nnot prevent polarization to arise. On the contrary, we find that pure galactic\nemission causes the polarization profile to be too steep to be consistent with\nobservations.\n", "  We enumerate the set of simplified models which match onto the complete set\nof gauge invariant effective operators up to dimension six describing\ninteractions of a singlet-like Majorana fermion dark matter with the standard\nmodel. Tree level matching conditions for each case are worked out in the large\nmediator mass limit, defining a one to one correspondence between the effective\noperator coefficients and the simplified model parameters for weakly\ninteracting models. Utilizing such a mapping, we compute the dark matter\nannihilation rate in the early universe, as well as other low-energy\nobservables like nuclear recoil rates using the effective operators, while the\nsimplified models are used to compute the dark matter production rates at high\nenergy colliders like LEP, LHC and future lepton colliders. Combining all\nrelevant constraints with a profile likelihood analysis, we then discuss the\ncurrently allowed parameter regions and prospects for future searches in terms\nof the effective operator parameters, reducing the model dependence to a\nminimal level. In the parameter region where such a model-independent analysis\nis applicable, and leaving aside the special dark matter mass regions where the\nannihilation proceeds through an s-channel Z or Higgs boson pole, the current\nconstraints allow effective operator suppression scales ($\\Lambda$) of the\norder of a few hundred GeV for dark matter masses $m_\\chi >$ 20 GeV at $95\\%$\nC.L., while the maximum allowed scale is around $3$ TeV for $m_\\chi \\sim\n\\mathcal{O}(1\\,{\\rm TeV})$. An estimate of the future reach of ton-scale direct\ndetection experiments and planned electron-positron colliders show that most of\nthe remaining regions can be probed, apart from dark matter masses near half of\nthe Z-boson mass (with $500\\,{\\rm GeV} < \\Lambda < 2\\,{\\rm TeV} $) and those\nbeyond the kinematic reach of the future lepton colliders.\n", "  We investigate numerically the applicability of dynamic facilitation (DF)\ntheory for glass-forming binary hard disk systems where supercompression is\ncontrolled by pressure. By using novel efficient algorithms for hard disks, we\nare able to generate equilibrium supercompressed states in an additive\nnon-equimolar binary mixture, where micro-crystallization and size segregation\ndo not emerge at high average packing fractions. Above an onset pressure where\ncollective heterogeneous relaxation sets in, we find that relaxation times are\nwell described by a \"parabolic law\" with pressure. We identify excitations, or\nsoft-spots, that give rise to structural relaxation, and find that they are\nspatially localized, their average concentration decays exponentially with\npressure, and their associated energy scale is logarithmic in the excitation\nsize. These observations are consistent with the predictions of DF generalized\nto systems controlled by pressure rather than temperature.\n", "  Multiplicities of charged pions and unidentified hadrons produced in\ndeep-inelastic scattering were measured in bins of the Bjorken scaling variable\n$x$, the relative virtual-photon energy $y$ and the relative hadron energy $z$.\nData were obtained by the COMPASS Collaboration using a 160 GeV muon beam and\nan isoscalar target ($^6$LiD). They cover the kinematic domain in the photon\nvirtuality $Q^2$ > 1(GeV/c$)^2$, $0.004 < x < 0.4$, $0.2 < z < 0.85$ and $0.1 <\ny < 0.7$. In addition, a leading-order pQCD analysis was performed using the\npion multiplicity results to extract quark fragmentation functions.\n", "  We significantly constrain the sky position, distance, and mass of a possible\nadditional, distant planet in the solar system by examining its influence on\nthe distance between Earth and the Cassini Spacecraft. Our preferred region is\napproximately centered on (RA, Dec) = ($40\\arcdeg$, $-15\\arcdeg$), extending\napproximately 20 degrees in all directions.\n", "  We present the first statistical sample of rest-frame far-UV spectra of\nstar-forming galaxies at z~1. These spectra are unique in that they cover the\nhigh-ionization CIV{\\lambda}{\\lambda}1548, 1550 doublet. We also detect\nlow-ionization features such as SiII{\\lambda}1527, FeII{\\lambda}1608,\nAlII{\\lambda}1670, NiII{\\lambda}{\\lambda}1741, 1751 and SiII{\\lambda}1808, and\nintermediate-ionization features from AlIII{\\lambda}{\\lambda}1854, 1862.\nComparing the properties of absorption lines of lower- and higher- ionization\nstates provides a window into the multi-phase nature of circumgalactic gas. Our\nsample is drawn from the DEEP2 survey and spans the redshift range 1.01 < z <\n1.35 (<z> = 1.25). By isolating the interstellar CIV absorption from the\nstellar P-Cygni wind profile we find that 69% of the CIV profiles are\nblueshifted with respect to the systemic velocity. Furthermore, CIV shows a\nsmall but significant blueshift relative to FeII (offset of the best-fit linear\nregression -76 $\\pm$ 26 km/s). At the same time, the CIV blueshift is on\naverage comparable to that of MgII{\\lambda}{\\lambda}2796, 2803. At this point,\nin explaining the larger blueshift of CIV absorption at the ~ 3-sigma level, we\ncannot distinguish between the faster motion of highly-ionized gas relative to\ngas traced by FeII, and filling in on the red side from resonant CIV emission.\nWe investigate how far-UV interstellar absorption kinematics correlate with\nother galaxy properties using stacked spectra. These stacking results show a\ndirect link between CIV absorption and the current SFR, though we only observe\nsmall velocity differences among different ionization states tracing the\noutflowing ISM.\n", "  We synthesized a series of V-doped LiFe$_{1-x}$V$_x$As single crystals. The\nsuperconducting transition temperature $T_c$ of LiFeAs decreases rapidly at a\nrate of 7 K per 1\\% V. The Hall coefficient of LiFeAs switches from negative to\npositive with 4.2\\% V doping, showing that V doping introduces hole carriers.\nThis observation is further confirmed by the evaluation of the Fermi surface\nvolume measured by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), from\nwhich a 0.3 hole doping per V atom introduced is deduced. Interestingly, the\nintroduction of holes does not follow a rigid band shift. We also show that the\ntemperature evolution of the electrical resistivity as a function of doping is\nconsistent with a crossover from a Fermi liquid to a non-Fermi liquid. Our\nARPES data indicate that the non-Fermi liquid behavior is mostly enhanced when\none of the hole $d_{xz}/d_{yz}$ Fermi surfaces is well nested by the\nantiferromagnetic wave vector to the inner electron Fermi surface pocket with\nthe $d_{xy}$ orbital character. The magnetic susceptibility of\nLiFe$_{1-x}$V$_x$As suggests the presence of strong magnetic impurities\nfollowing V doping, thus providing a natural explanation to the rapid\nsuppression of superconductivity upon V doping.\n", "  Possible paths of a photon passing through a nested Mach-Zehnder\ninterferometer on its way to a detector are analyzed using the consistent\nhistories formulation of quantum mechanics, and confirmed using a set of weak\nmeasurements (but not weak values). The results disagree with an analysis by\nVaidman [ Phys.\\ Rev.\\ A 87 (2013) 052104 ], and agree with a conclusion\nreached by Li et al.\\ [ Phys.\\ Rev.\\ A 88 (2013) 046102 ]. However, the\nanalysis casts serious doubt on the claim of Salih et al.\\ (whose authorship\nincludes Li et al.) [ Phys.\\ Rev.\\ Lett.\\ 110 (2013) 170502 ] to have\nconstructed a protocol for counterfactual communication: a channel which can\ntransmit information even though it contains a negligible number of photons.\n", "  We have characterized the strength of the interfacial Dyzaloshinskii-Moriya\ninteraction (DMI) in ultrathin perpendicularly magnetized CoFeB/MgO films,\ngrown on different underlayers of W, TaN, and Hf, using two experimental\nmethods. First, we determined the effective DMI field from measurements of\nfield-driven domain wall motion in the creep regime, where applied in-plane\nmagnetic fields induce an anisotropy in the wall propagation that is correlated\nwith the DMI strength. Second, Brillouin light spectroscopy was employed to\nquantify the frequency non-reciprocity of spin waves in the CoFeB layers, which\nyielded an independent measurement of the DMI. By combining these results, we\nshow that DMI estimates from the different techniques only yield qualitative\nagreement, which suggests that open questions remain on the underlying models\nused to interpret these results.\n", "  We construct ensembles of random scalar potentials for $N_f$ interacting\nscalar fields using non-equilibrium random matrix theory, and use these to\nstudy the generation of observables during small-field inflation. For\n$N_f={\\cal O}({\\rm few})$, these heavily featured scalar potentials give rise\nto power spectra that are highly non-linear, at odds with observations. For\n$N_f\\gg 1$, the superhorizon evolution of the perturbations is generically\nsubstantial, yet the power spectra simplify considerably and become more\npredictive, with most realisations being well approximated by a linear power\nspectrum. This provides proof of principle that complex inflationary physics\ncan give rise to simple emergent power spectra. We explain how these results\ncan be understood in terms of large $N_f$ universality of random matrix theory.\n", "  Breather solutions of the nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation (NLSE) are known\nto be considered as backbone models for extreme events in the ocean as well as\nin Kerr media. These exact determinisitic rogue wave (RW) prototypes on a\nregular background describe a wide-range of modulation instability\nconfigurations. Alternatively, oceanic or electromagnetic wave fields can be of\nchaotic nature and it is known that RWs may develop in such conditions as well.\nWe report an experimental study confirming that extreme localizations in an\nirregular oceanic JONSWAP wave field can be tracked back to originate from\nexact NLSE breather solutions, such as the Peregrine breather. Numerical NLSE\nas well as modified NLSE simulations are both in good agreement with laboratory\nexperiments and highlight the significance of universal weakly nonlinear\nevolution equations in the emergence as well as prediction of extreme events in\nnonlinear dispersive media.\n", "  We study spectral properties of the Dirac and scalar Laplace operator on the\nEuclidean Schwarzschild space, both twisted by a family of abelian connections\nwith anti-self-dual curvature. We show that the zero-modes of the gauged Dirac\noperator, first studied by Pope, take a particularly simple form in terms of\nthe radius of the Euclidean time orbits, and interpret them in the context of\ngeometric models of matter. For the gauged Laplace operator, we study the\nspectrum of bound states numerically and observe that it can be approximated\nwith remarkable accuracy by that of the exactly solvable gauged Laplace\noperator on the Euclidean Taub-NUT space.\n", "  We show the importance of separated efficiency corrections between positively\nand negatively charged particles for cumulant calculations by Monte Carlo toy\nmodels and analytical calculations. Our results indicate that S{\\sigma} in\npublished net-proton results from the STAR experiment will be suppressed about\n5 to 10% in central collisions, and 10 to 20% in peripheral collisions at the\nbeam energy of \\sqrt s_{NN} = 62.4 and 200 GeV if the separated efficiencies\nare used to efficiency correction.\n", "  We analyze spectrum of waveguide modes of an arbitrary uniaxial anisotropic\nmetamaterial slab with non-local electromagnetic response whose permittivity\ntensor could be described within Drude approximation. Spatial dispersion was\nintroduced within the hydrodynamical model. Both anisotropy and spatial\ndispersion were considered as perturbations. This helps to distinguish their\neffect on the spectrum of the slab and to analyze lifting of the degeneracy of\neigenmodes at plasma frequency in detail. Spatial dispersion is shown to result\nin break of the singularity in the den- sity of optical states in the\nhyperbolic regime and in suppression of negative dispersion induced by\nanisotropy. Mutual effect of spatial dispersion and anisotropy can bring light\nto a complete stop at certain frequencies.\n", "  Since their discovery, topological insulators have been expected to be ideal\nspintronic materials owing to the spin currents carried by surface states with\nspin--momentum locking. However, the bulk doping problem remains an obstacle\nthat hinders such application. In this work, we predict that a newly discovered\nfamily of topological materials, the Weyl semimetals, exhibits large intrinsic\nspin Hall effects that can be utilized to generate and detect spin currents.\nOur $ab~initio$ calculations reveal a large spin Hall conductivity that is\ncomparable to that of $4d$ and $5d$ transition metals. The spin Hall effect\noriginates intrinsically from the bulk band structure of Weyl semimetals, which\nexhibit a large Berry curvature and spin--orbit coupling, so the bulk carrier\nproblem in the topological insulators is naturally avoided. Our work not only\npaves the way for employing Weyl semimetals in spintronics, but also proposes a\nnew guideline for searching for the spin Hall effect in various topological\nmaterials.\n", "  When determining absolute ages of identifiably young stellar populations,\nresults strongly depend on which stars are studied. Cooler (K, M) stars\ntypically yield ages that are systematically younger than warmer (A, F, G)\nstars by a factor of two. I explore the possibility that these age\ndiscrepancies are the result of magnetic inhibition of convection in cool young\nstars by using magnetic stellar evolution isochrones to determine the age of\nthe Upper Scorpius subgroup of the Scorpius-Centaurus OB Association. A median\nage of 10 Myr consistent across spectral types A through M is found, except for\na subset of F-type stars that appear significantly older. Agreement is shown\nfor ages derived from the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram and from the empirical\nmass-radius relationship defined by eclipsing multiple-star systems. Surface\nmagnetic field strengths required to produce agreement are of order 2.5 kG and\nare predicted from a priori estimates of equipartition values. A region in the\nHR diagram is identified that plausibly connects stars whose structures are\nweakly influenced by the presence of magnetic fields with those whose\nstructures are strongly influenced by magnetic fields. The models suggest this\nregion is characterized by stars with rapidly thinning outer convective\nenvelopes where the radiative core mass is greater than 75% of the total\nstellar mass. Furthermore, depletion of lithium predicted from magnetic models\nappears in better agreement with observed lithium equivalent widths than\npredictions from non-magnetic models. These results suggest that magnetic\ninhibition of convection plays an important role in the early evolution of\nlow-mass stars and that it may be responsible for noted age discrepancies in\nyoung stellar populations.\n", "  Multi-layered Josephson junctions are modeled in the context of a field\ntheory, and dynamics of Josephson vortices trapped inside insulators are\nstudied. Starting from a theory consisting of complex and real scalar fields\ncoupled to a U(1) gauge field which admit parallel $N-1$ domain-wall solutions,\nJosephson couplings are introduced weakly between the complex scalar fields.\nThe $N-1$ domain walls behave as insulators separating $N$ superconductors,\nwhere one of the complex scalar fields has a gap. We construct the effective\nLagrangian on the domain walls, which reduces to a coupled sine-Gordon model\nfor well-separated walls We then construct sine-Gordon solitons emerging in an\neffective theory in which we identify Josephson vortices carrying singly\nquantized magnetic fluxes. When two neighboring superconductors tend to have\nthe same phase, the ground state does not change with the positions of domain\nwalls. On the other hand, when two neighboring superconductors tend to have\n$\\pi$-phase differences, the ground state has a phase transition depending on\nthe positions of domain walls; when the two walls are close to each other,\nfrustration occurs because of the coupling between the two superconductors\nbesides the thin superconductor. Focusing on the case of three superconductors\nseparated by two insulators, we find for the former case that the interaction\nbetween two Josephson vortices on different insulators changes its nature,\ni.e., attractive or repulsive, depending on the positions of the domain walls.\nIn the latter case, there emerges fractional Josephson vortices when two\ndegenerate ground states appear due to spontaneous charge-symmetry breaking,\nand the number of the Josephson vortices varies with the position of the domain\nwalls. Our predictions should be verified in multilayered Josephson junctions.\n", "  We report on the emergence of robust multi-clustered chimera states in a\ndissipative-driven system of symmetrically and locally coupled identical SQUID\noscillators. The \"snake-like\" resonance curve of the single SQUID\n(Superconducting QUantum Interference Device) is the key to the formation of\nthe chimera states and is responsible for the extreme multistability exhibited\nby the coupled system that leads to attractor crowding at the geometrical\nresonance (inductive-capacitive) frequency. Until now, chimera states were\nmostly believed to exist for nonlocal coupling. Our findings provide\ntheoretical evidence that nearest neighbor interactions are indeed capable of\nsupporting such states in a wide parameter range. SQUID metamaterials are the\nsubject of intense experimental investigations and we are highly confident that\nthe complex dynamics demonstrated in this manuscript can be confirmed in the\nlaboratory.\n", "  We analyze from a classical and quantum point of view the behavior of the\nuniverse close to a little rip, which can be interpreted as a big rip sent\ntowards the infinite future. Like a big rip singularity, a little rip implies\nthe destruction of all bounded structure in the Universe and is thus an event\nwhere quantum effects could be important. We present here a new phantom scalar\nfield model for the little rip. The quantum analysis is performed in quantum\ngeometrodynamics, with the Wheeler-DeWitt equation as its central equation. We\nfind that the little rip can be avoided in the sense of the DeWitt criterion,\nthat is, by having a vanishing wave function at the place of the little rip.\nTherefore our analysis completes the answer to the question: can quantum\ncosmology smoothen or avoid the divergent behavior genuinely caused by phantom\nmatter? We show that this can indeed happen for the little rip, similar to the\navoidance of a big rip and a little sibling of the big rip.\n", "  We analyze in detail the possibility to use charge-dipole interaction between\na single polar molecule or a 1D molecular array and a single Rydberg atom to\nread out rotational populations. The change in the Rydberg electron energy is\nconditioned on the rotational state of the polar molecules, allowing for\nrealization of a CNOT quantum gate between the molecules and the atom.\nSubsequent readout of the atomic fluorescence results in a non-destructive\nmeasurement of the rotational state. We study the interaction between a 1D\narray of polar molecules and an array or a cloud of atoms in a Rydberg\nsuperatom (blockaded) state and calculate the resolved energy shifts of Rb(60s)\nwith KRb and RbYb molecules, with N=1, 3, 5 molecules. We show that collective\nmolecular rotational states can be read out using the conditioned Rydberg\nenergy shifts.\n", "  We study a model describing competition of interactions between $N$ two-level\nsystems (TLSs) against decoherence. We apply it to analyze dye molecules in an\noptical microcavity, where molecular vibrations provide a local source for\ndecoherence. Most interesting is the case when decoherence strongly affects\neach individual TLS, e.g. via broadening of emission lines as well as\nvibrational satellites, however its influence is strongly suppressed for large\n$N$ due to the interactions between TLSs. In this interaction dominated regime\nwe find unique signatures in the emission spectrum, including strong\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{N})$ level shifts, as well as $1/N$ suppression of both the\ndecoherence width and of the vibrational satellites.\n", "  We study production of light particles due to oscillation of the Hubble\nparameter or the scale factor. Any coherently oscillating scalar field,\nirrespective of its energy fraction in the universe, imprints such an\noscillating feature on them. Not only the Einstein gravity but extended gravity\nmodels, such as models with non-minimal (derivative) coupling to gravity and\n$f(R)$ gravity, lead to oscillation of the scale factor. We present a\nconvenient way to estimate the gravitational particle production rate in these\ncircumstances. Cosmological implications of gravitational particle production,\nsuch as dark matter/radiation and moduli problem, are discussed. For example,\nif the theory is described solely by the standard model plus the Peccei-Quinn\nsector, the Starobinsky $R^2$ inflation may lead to observable amount of axion\ndark radiation.\n", "  Tubular crystals, two-dimensional lattices wrapped into cylindrical\ntopologies, arise in many contexts, including botany and biofilaments, and in\nphysical systems such as carbon nanotubes. The geometrical principles of\nbotanical phyllotaxis, describing the spiral packings on cylinders commonly\nfound in nature, have found application in all these systems. Several recent\nstudies have examined defects in tubular crystals associated with crystalline\npackings that must accommodate a fixed tube radius. Here, we study the\nmechanics of tubular crystals with variable tube radius, with dislocations\ninterposed between regions of different phyllotactic packings. Unbinding and\nseparation of dislocation pairs with equal and opposite Burgers vectors allow\nthe growth of one phyllotactic domain at the expense of another. In particular,\nglide separation of dislocations offers a low-energy mode for plastic\ndeformations of solid tubes in response to external stresses, reconfiguring the\nlattice step by step. Through theory and simulation, we examine how the tube's\nradius and helicity affects, and is in turn altered by, the mechanics of\ndislocation glide. We also discuss how a sufficiently strong bending rigidity\ncan alter or arrest the deformations of tubes with small radii.\n", "  We report $\\sim$3 au resolution imaging observations of the protoplanetary\ndisk around TW Hya at 145 and 233 GHz with the Atacama Large\nMillimeter/Submillimeter Array. Our observations revealed two deep gaps\n($\\sim$25--50 \\%) at 22 and 37~au and shallower gaps (a few \\%) at 6, 28, and\n44~au, as recently reported by Andrews et al. (2016). The central hole with a\nradius of $\\sim3$~au was also marginally resolved. The most remarkable finding\nis that the spectral index $\\alpha (R)$ between bands 4 and 6 peaks at the\n22~au gap. The derived power-law index of the dust opacity $\\beta (R)$ is\n$\\sim1.7$ at the 22~au gap and decreases toward the disk center to $\\sim0$. The\nmost prominent gap at 22~au could be caused by the gravitational interaction\nbetween the disk and an unseen planet with a mass of $\\lesssim$1.5\n$M_\\mathrm{Neptune}$ although other origins may be possible. The planet-induced\ngap is supported by the fact that $\\beta (R)$ is enhanced at the 22~au gap,\nindicating a deficit of $\\sim$mm-sized grains within the gap due to dust\nfiltration by a planet.\n", "  Diffuse striations in molecular clouds are preferentially aligned with local\nmagnetic fields whereas dense filaments tend to be perpendicular to them. When\nand why this transition occurs remain uncertain. To explore the physics behind\nthis transition, we compute the histogram of relative orientation (HRO) between\nthe density gradient and the magnetic field in 3D MHD simulations of prestellar\ncore formation in shock-compressed regions within GMCs. We find that, in the\nmagnetically-dominated (sub-Alfv\\'enic) post-shock region, the gas structure is\npreferentially aligned with the local magnetic field. For overdense sub-regions\nwith super-Alfv\\'enic gas, their elongation becomes preferentially\nperpendicular to the local magnetic field instead. The transition occurs when\nself-gravitating gas gains enough kinetic energy from the gravitational\nacceleration to overcome the magnetic support against the cross-field\ncontraction, which results in a power-law increase of the field strength with\ndensity. Similar results can be drawn from HROs in projected 2D maps with\nintegrated column densities and synthetic polarized dust emission. We\nquantitatively analyze our simulated polarization properties, and interpret the\nreduced polarization fraction at high column densities as the result of\nincreased distortion of magnetic field directions in trans- or super-Alfv\\'enic\ngas. Furthermore, we introduce measures of the inclination and tangledness of\nthe magnetic field along the line of sight as the controlling factors of the\npolarization fraction. Observations of the polarization fraction and angle\ndispersion can therefore be utilized in studying local magnetic field\nmorphology in star-forming regions.\n", "  Real-time dynamics in one-dimensional transverse Ising model coupled with the\ntime-dependent oscillating field is analyzed by using the infinite\ntime-evolving block decimation algorithm and the Floquet theory. In particular,\nthe transient dynamics induced by the pulse field and their connections to the\ndynamics by a continuous-wave field are focused on. During the pulse-field\nirradiation, the order parameter shows a characteristic oscillation, in which\nthe frequency shifts from the pulse-field frequency. This is considered as a\nkind of the Rabi oscillation, but the frequency strongly depends on the\nintersite Ising interaction. After turning off the pulse field, the oscillation\nremains with a frequency $\\mathit{\\Omega}$ and a damping constant $\\gamma$. In\nthe case of low fluence, both $\\mathit{\\Omega}$ and $\\gamma$ are scaled by the\npulse amplitude in a wide range of the parameter values of the model. In the\ncase of high fluence, $\\mathit{\\Omega}$ and $\\gamma$ are arranged by a product\nof the pulse amplitude and the pulse width. This implies that the dynamics\nafter turning off the pulse field are decided by a population of the excited\nstate when the pulse field is turned off.\n", "  We present results from our observing campaign of Comet 209P/LINEAR during\nits exceptionally close approach to Earth during May of 2014, the third\nsmallest perigee of any comet in two centuries. These circumstances permitted\nus to pursue several studies of this intrinsically faint object, including\nmeasurements of gas and dust production rates, searching for coma morphology,\nand direct detection of the nucleus to measure its properties. Indeed, we\nsuccessfully measured the lowest water production rates of an intact comet in\nover 35 years and a corresponding smallest active area, ~0.007 km^2. When\ncombined with the nucleus size found from radar (Howell et al. 2014), this also\nyields the smallest active fraction for any comet, ~0.024%. In all, this\nstrongly suggests that 209P/LINEAR is on its way to becoming an inert object.\nThe nucleus was detected but could not easily be disentangled from the inner\ncoma due to seeing variations and changing spatial scales. Even so, we were\nable to measure a double-peaked lightcurve consistent with the shorter of two\nviable rotational periods found by Hergenrother (2014). Radial profiles of the\ndust coma are quite steep, similar to that observed for some other very anemic\ncomets and suggestive that vaporizing icy grains are present.\n", "  Feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN) is believed to prevent\ncatastrophic cooling in galaxy clusters. However, how the feedback energy is\ntransformed into heat, and how the AGN jets heat the intracluster medium (ICM)\nisotropically, still remain elusive. In this work, we gain insights into the\nrelative importance of different heating mechanisms using three-dimensional\nhydrodynamic simulations including cold gas accretion and momentum-driven jet\nfeedback, which are the most successful models to date in terms reproducing the\nproperties of cool cores. We find that there is net heating within two `jet\ncones' (within ~30 degrees from the axis of jet precession) where the ICM gains\nentropy by shock heating and mixing with the hot thermal gas within bubbles.\nOutside the jet cones, the ambient gas is heated by weak shocks, but not enough\nto overcome radiative cooling, therefore forming a `reduced' cooling flow.\nConsequently, the cluster core is in a process of `gentle circulation' over\nbillions of years. Within the jet cones, there is significant adiabatic cooling\nas the gas is uplifted by buoyantly rising bubbles; outside the cones, energy\nis supplied by inflow of already-heated gas from the jet cones as well as\nadiabatic compression as the gas moves toward the center. In other words, the\nfluid dynamics self-adjusts such that it compensates and transports the heat\nprovided by the AGN, and hence no fine-tuning of the heating profile of any\nprocess is necessary. Throughout the cluster evolution, turbulent energy is\nonly at the percent level compared to gas thermal energy, and thus turbulent\nheating is not the main source of heating in our simulation.\n", "  The dynamical generation of a fermion mass is studied within\n($2+1$)-dimensional QED with $N$ four-component fermions in the leading and\nnext-to-leading orders of the 1/N expansion. The analysis is carried out in the\nLandau gauge which is supposed to insure the gauge independence of the critical\nfermion flavour number, N_c. It is found that the dynamical fermion mass\nappears for N<N_c where N_c=3.29, that is only about $1\\%$ larger than its\nvalue at leading order.\n", "  We discuss the superfluid properties of a Bose-Einstein condensed gas with\nspin-orbit coupling, recently realized in experiments. We find a finite normal\nfluid density $\\rho_n$ at zero temperature which turns out to be a function of\nthe Raman coupling. In particular, the entire fluid becomes normal at the\ntransition point from the zero momentum to the plane wave phase, even though\nthe condensate fraction remains finite. We emphasize the crucial role played by\nthe gapped branch of the elementary excitations and discuss its contributions\nto various sum rules. Finally, we prove that an independent definition of\nsuperfluid density $\\rho_s$, using the phase twist method, satisfies the\nequality $\\rho_n+\\rho_s=\\rho$, the total density, despite the breaking of\nGalilean invariance.\n", "  We study the $Y(4260)$ production mechanism in $e^+e^-$ annihilations in the\nframework of hadronic molecules and investigate the consequence of such a\npicture in different decay channels. In the hadronic molecule picture the\n$Y(4260)$ is described as a mixture state composed of a long-ranged\n$\\bar{D}D_1(2420)+c.c.$ molecule state and a compact $c\\bar{c}$ component. We\nshow that the compositeness relation can still provide a reasonable constraint\non the wavefunction renormalization parameter due to the dominance of the\nmolecular component. Such a mechanism can be regarded as a natural consequence\nof the heavy quark spin symmetry (HQSS) breaking. This study elaborates the\nmolecular picture for the $Y(4260)$ in the $e^+e^-$ annihilations and affirms\nthat the cross section lineshape of $e^+e^-\\to \\bar{D}D^*\\pi+c.c.$ in the\nvicinity of the $Y(4260)$ should have a nontrivial behavior. In this framework\nwe predict that the upper limit of the $Y(4260)$ leptonic decay width is about\n500 eV. We also investigate the coupling for $D_1(2420)\\to D^*\\pi$ in the\n$^3P_0$ quark model and examine the possible HQSS breaking effects due to the\ndeviation from the $|^1P_1\\rangle$ and $|^3P_1\\rangle$ ideal mixing. This will\nin turn provide a constraint on the HQSS breaking coupling for the $Y(4260)$ to\n$\\bar{D}D_1(2420)+c.c.$ via its $c\\bar{c}$ component.\n", "  Short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are believed to be produced by relativistic\njets from mergers of neutron-stars (NS) or neutron-stars and black-holes (BH).\nIf the Lorentz-factors $\\Gamma$ of jets from compact-stellar-mergers follow a\nsimilar power-law distribution to those observed for other high-energy\nastrophysical phenomena (e.g. blazars, AGN), the population of jets would be\ndominated by low-$\\Gamma$ outflows. These jets will not produce the prompt\ngamma-rays, but jet energy will be released as x-ray/optical/radio transients\nwhen they collide with the ambient medium. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we\nstudy the properties of such transients. Approximately $78\\%$ of merger-jets\n$<300~$Mpc result in failed-GRBs if the jet $\\Gamma$ follows a power-law\ndistribution of index $-1.75$. X-ray/optical transients from failed-GRBs will\nhave broad distributions of their characteristics: light-curves peak\n$t_p\\sim0.1-10~$days after a merger; flux peaks for x-ray\n$10^{-6}{\\rm~mJy}\\lesssim~F_x\\lesssim10^{-2}~$mJy; and optical flux peaks at\n$14\\lesssim~m_g\\lesssim22$. X-ray transients are detectable by Swift XRT, and\n$\\sim85\\%$ of optical transients will be detectable by telescopes with limiting\nmagnitude $m_g \\gtrsim 21$, for well localized sources on the sky.\nX-ray/optical transients are followed by radio transients with peak times\nnarrowly clustered around $t_p\\sim10~$days, and peak flux of $\\sim~10-100~$mJy\nat 10 GHz and $\\sim~0.1~$mJy at 150 MHz. By considering the all-sky rate of\nshort GRBs within the LIGO/Virgo range, the rate of on-axis orphan afterglows\nfrom failed-GRB would be 2.6(26) per year for NS-NS(NS-BH) mergers,\nrespectively. Since merger jets from gravitational-wave (GW) trigger events\ntend to be directed to us, a significant fraction of GW events could be\nassociated with the on-axis orphan afterglow.\n", "  Developing quantitative methods for characterizing structural properties of\nforce chains in densely packed granular media is an important step toward\nunderstanding or predicting large-scale physical properties of a packing. A\npromising framework in which to develop such methods is network science, which\ncan be used to translate particle locations and force contacts to a graph in\nwhich particles are represented by nodes and forces between particles are\nrepresented by weighted edges. Applying network-based community-detection\ntechniques to extract force chains opens the door to developing statistics of\nforce chain structure, with the goal of identifying shape differences across\npackings, and providing a foundation on which to build predictions of bulk\nmaterial properties from mesoscale network features. Here, we discuss a trio of\nrelated but fundamentally distinct measurements of mesoscale structure of force\nchains in arbitrary 2D packings, including a novel statistic derived using\ntools from algebraic topology, which together provide a tool set for the\nanalysis of force chain architecture. We demonstrate the utility of this tool\nset by detecting variations in force chain architecture with pressure.\nCollectively, these techniques can be generalized to 3D packings, and to the\nassessment of continuous deformations of packings under stress or strain.\n", "  This paper introduces a catalog of gravitational waveforms from the bank of\nsimulations by the numerical relativity effort at Georgia Tech. Currently, the\ncatalog consists of 452 distinct waveforms from more than 600 binary black hole\nsimulations: 128 of the waveforms are from binaries with black hole spins\naligned with the orbital angular momentum, and 324 are from precessing binary\nblack hole systems. The waveforms from binaries with non-spinning black holes\nhave mass-ratios $q = m_1/m_2 \\le 15$, and those with precessing, spinning\nblack holes have $q \\le 8$. The waveforms expand a moderate number of orbits in\nthe late inspiral, the burst during coalescence, and the ring-down of the final\nblack hole. Examples of waveforms in the catalog matched against the widely\nused approximate models are presented. In addition, predictions of the mass and\nspin of the final black hole by phenomenological fits are tested against the\nresults from the simulation bank. The role of the catalog in interpreting the\nGW150914 event and future massive binary black-hole search in LIGO is\ndiscussed. The Georgia Tech catalog is publicly available at\neinstein.gatech.edu/catalog.\n", "  We present MCRaT, a Monte Carlo Radiation Transfer code for self-consistently\ncomputing the light curves and spectra of the photospheric emission from\nrelativistic, unmagnetized jets. We apply MCRaT to a relativistic hydrodynamic\nsimulation of a long duration gamma-ray burst jet, and present the resulting\nlight-curves and time-dependent spectra for observers at various angles from\nthe jet axis. We compare our results to observational results and find that\nphotospheric emission is a viable model to explain the prompt phase of\nlong-duration gamma-ray bursts at the peak frequency and above, but faces\nchallenges in reproducing the flat spectrum below the peak frequency. We\nfinally discuss possible limitations of these results both in terms of the\nhydrodynamics and the radiation transfer and how these limitations could affect\nthe conclusions that we present.\n", "  We analyse in detail the effect of non-trivial band topology on the area law\nbehaviour of the entanglement entropy in Kitaev's honeycomb model. By mapping\nthe translationally invariant 2D spin model into 1D fermionic subsystems, we\nidentify those subsystems responsible for universal entanglement contributions\nin the gapped phases and those responsible for critical entanglement scaling in\nthe gapless phases. For the gapped phases we analytically show how the\ntopological edge states contribute to the entanglement entropy and provide a\nuniversal lower bound for it. For the gapless semi-metallic phases and\ntopological phase transitions the identification of the critical subsystems\nshows that they fall always into the Ising or the XY universality classes. As\nour study concerns the fermionic degrees of freedom in the honeycomb model,\nqualitatively similar results are expected to apply also to generic topological\ninsulators and superconductors.\n", "  The magnetic susceptibility of the QCD vacuum is analyzed in the framework of\na nonlocal SU(3) Polyakov-Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model. Considering two different\nmodel parametrizations, we estimate the values of the $u$ and $s$-quark tensor\ncoefficients and magnetic susceptibilities and then we extend the analysis to\nfinite temperature systems. Our numerical results are compared to those\nobtained in other theoretical approaches and in lattice QCD calculations.\n", "  Barnard B1b has revealed as one of the most interesting globules from the\nchemical and dynamical point of view. It presents a rich molecular chemistry\ncharacterized by large abundances of deuterated and complex molecules.\nFurthermore, it hosts an extremely young Class 0 object and one candidate to\nFirst Hydrostatic Core (FHSC). Our aim was to determine the cosmic ray\nionization rate and the depletion factors in this extremely young star forming\nregion. We carried out a spectral survey towards Barnard 1b as part of the IRAM\nLarge program ASAI using the IRAM 30-m telescope at Pico Veleta (Spain). This\nprovided a very complete inventory of neutral and ionic C-, N- and S- bearing\nspecies with, up to our knowledge, the first secure detections of the\ndeuterated ions DCS+ and DOCO+. We used a state-of-the-art\npseudo-time-dependent gas-phase chemical model to determine the value of the\ncosmic ray ionization rate and the depletion factors. The observational data\nwere well fitted with $\\zeta_{H_2}$ between 3E-17 s$^{-1}$ and 1E-16 s$^{-1}$.\nElemental depletions were estimated to be ~10 for C and O, ~1 for N and ~25 for\nS. Barnard B1b presents similar depletions of C and O than those measured in\npre-stellar cores. The depletion of sulfur is higher than that of C and O but\nnot as extreme as in cold cores. In fact, it is similar to the values found in\nsome bipolar outflows, hot cores and photon-dominated regions. Several\nscenarios are discussed to account for these peculiar abundances. We propose\nthat it is the consequence of the initial conditions (important outflows and\nenhanced UV fields in the surroundings) and a rapid collapse (~0.1 Myr) that\npermits to maintain most S- and N-bearing species in gas phase to great optical\ndepths. The interaction of the compact outflow associated with B1b-S with the\nsurrounding material could enhance the abundances of S-bearing molecules, as\nwell.\n", "  We study possible edge states in single layers of honeycomb materials such as\n$\\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ and A$_2$IrO$_3$ (A=Li, Na) with strong spin-orbit coupling\n(SOC). These two dimensional systems exhibit linearly dispersing\none-dimensional (1D) edge states when their 1D boundary forms a zig-zag shape.\nUsing an effective tight-binding model based on first principles band structure\ncalculations including Hubbard U and SOC, we find degenerate edge states at the\nzone center and zone boundary. The roles of chiral symmetry and time-reversal\nsymmetry are presented. The implications to experimental signatures and the\neffects of disorder are also discussed.\n", "  We present an improved Global Sky Model (GSM) of diffuse galactic radio\nemission from 10 MHz to 5 THz, whose uses include foreground modeling for CMB\nand 21 cm cosmology. Our model improves on past work both algorithmically and\nby adding new data sets such as the Planck maps and the enhanced Haslam map.\nOur method generalizes the Principal Component Analysis approach to handle\nnon-overlapping regions, enabling the inclusion of 29 sky maps with no region\nof the sky common to all. We also perform a blind separation of our GSM into\nphysical components with a method that makes no assumptions about physical\nemission mechanisms (synchrotron, free-free, dust, etc). Remarkably, this blind\nmethod automatically finds five components that have previously only been found\n\"by hand\", which we identify with synchrotron, free-free, cold dust, warm dust,\nand the CMB anisotropy, with maps and spectra agreeing with previous work but\nin many cases with smaller error bars. The improved GSM is available online at\ngithub.com/jeffzhen/gsm2016.\n", "  We use 5 test data series to quantify putative discontinuities around 1946 in\n5 annual-mean sunspot number or group number sequences. The series tested are:\nthe original and new versions of the Wolf/Zurich/International sunspot number\ncomposite [$R_{ISNv1}$ and $R_{ISNv2}$] ; the corrected version of $R_{ISNv1}$\n[$R_C$]; the backbone group number [$R_{BB}$]; and the group number composite\n[$R_{UEA}$]. The test data are: the group number $N_G$ and total sunspot area\n$A_G$ from the RGO photoheliographic data; the CaK index from re-analysis of\nMWO CaII K spectroheliograms; the group number from the MWO sunspot drawings,\n$N_{MWO}$; and ionospheric critical frequencies at Slough [$foF2$]. The test\ndata all vary with sunspot numbers, in some cases non-linearly. Tests use both\nbefore-and-after fit-residual comparison and correlation methods, applied to\nintervals iterated to minimise errors and eliminate the effect of the\ndiscontinuity date. It is not assumed that the correction required is by a\nconstant factor, nor even linear in sunspot number. A non-linear correction is\nrequired by $R_C$, $R_{BB}$ and $R_{ISNv1}$, but not by $R_{ISNv2}$ or\n$R_{UEA}$. The test datasets give very similar results in all cases. By\nmultiplying the probability distribution functions together we obtain the\noptimum correction for each data series that must be applied to\npre-discontinuity data to make them consistent with the post-discontinuity\ndata. It is shown that, on average, values for 1932-1943 are too small\n(relative to later values) by about 12.3% for $R_{ISNv1}$ but are too large for\n$R_{ISNv2}$ and $R_{BB}$ by 3.8% and 5.2%. The correction applied to generate\n$R_C$ from $R_{ISNv1}$ reduces this average factor to 0.5% but does not remove\nthe non-linear variation, and other errors remain uncorrected. A test is\nprovided by $R_{UEA}$, which is identical to the RGO $N_G$ values over the\ninterval used.\n", "  A small fraction of red giants are known to be lithium (Li) rich, in\ncontradiction with expectations from stellar evolutionary theory. A possible\nexplanation for these atypical giants is the engulfment of a Li-rich planet or\nbrown dwarf by the star. In this work, we model the evolution of Li abundance\nin canonical red giants including the accretion of a sub-stellar mass\ncompanion. We consider a wide range of stellar and companion masses, Li\nabundances, stellar metallicities, and planetary orbital periods. Based on our\ncalculations, companions with masses lower than 15 M_J dissolve in the\nconvective envelope and can induce Li enrichment in regimes where extra mixing\ndoes not operate. Our models indicate that the accretion of a substellar\ncompanion can explain abundances up to A(Li)~2.2, setting an upper limit for\nLi-rich giants formed by this mechanism. Giants with higher abundances need\nanother mechanism to be explained. For reasonable planetary distributions, we\npredict the Li abundance distribution of low-mass giants undergoing planet\nengulfment, finding that between 1% to 3% of them should have A(Li)>1.5. We\nshow that depending on the stellar mass range, this traditional definition of\nLi-rich giants is misleading, as isolated massive stars would be considered\nanomalous while giants engulfing a companion would be set aside, flagged as\nnormal. We explore the detectability of companion engulfment, finding that\nplanets with masses higher than ~7 M_J produce a distinct signature, and that\ndescendants of stars originating in the Li-dip and low luminosity red giants\nare ideal tests of this channel.\n", "  The thermal motion of a dust particle levitated in a plasma chamber is\nsimilar to that described by Brownian motion in many ways. The primary\ndifferences between a dust particle in a plasma system and a free Brownian\nparticle is that in addition to the random collisions between the dust particle\nand the neutral gas atoms, there are electric field fluctuations, dust charge\nfluctuations, and correlated motions from the unwanted continuous signals\noriginating within the plasma system itself. This last contribution does not\ninclude random motion and is therefore separable from the random motion in a\nnormal temperature measurement. In this paper, we discuss how to separate\nrandom and coherent motion of a dust particle confined in a glass box in a\nGaseous Electronic Conference radio frequency reference cell employing\nexperimentally determined dust particle fluctuation data analyzed using the\nmean square displacement technique.\n", "  Quantum computing technology has reached a second renaissance in the past\nfive years. Increased interest from both the private and public sector combined\nwith extraordinary theoretical and experimental progress has solidified this\ntechnology as a major advancement in the 21st century. As anticipated by many,\nthe first realisation of quantum computing technology would occur over the\ncloud, with users logging onto dedicated hardware over the classical internet.\nRecently IBM has released the {\\em Quantum Experience} which allows users to\naccess a five qubit quantum processor. In this paper we take advantage of this\nonline availability of actual quantum hardware and present four quantum\ninformation experiments that have never been demonstrated before. We utilise\nthe IBM chip to realise protocols in Quantum Error Correction, Quantum\nArithmetic, Quantum graph theory and Fault-tolerant quantum computation, by\naccessing the device remotely through the cloud. While the results are subject\nto significant noise, the correct results are returned from the chip. This\ndemonstrates the power of experimental groups opening up their technology to a\nwider audience and will hopefully allow for the next stage development in\nquantum information technology.\n", "  We use time-domain optical spectroscopy to distinguish between broad emission\nlines powered by accreting black holes (BHs) or stellar processes (i.e.,\nsupernovae) for 16 galaxies identified as AGN candidates by Reines \\etal\n(2013). Our study is primarily focused on those objects with narrow\nemission-line ratios dominated by star formation. Based on follow-up spectra\ntaken with the Magellan Echellette Spectrograph (MagE), the Dual Imaging\nSpectrograph, and the Ohio State Multi-Object Spectrograph, we find that the\nbroad H$\\alpha$ emission has faded or was ambiguous for all of the star-forming\nobjects (14/16) over baselines ranging from 5 to 14 years. For the two objects\nin our follow-up sample with narrow-line AGN signatures (RGG 9 and RGG 119), we\nfind persistent broad H$\\alpha$ emission consistent with an AGN origin.\nAdditionally, we use our MagE observations to measure stellar velocity\ndispersions for 15 objects in the Reines et al. (2013) sample, all with\nnarrow-line ratios indicating the presence of an AGN. Stellar masses range from\n$\\sim5\\times10^{8}$ to $3\\times10^{9}$~\\msun, and we measure $\\sigma_{\\ast}$\nranging from $28-71~{\\rm km~s^{-1}}$. These $\\sigma_{\\ast}$ correspond to some\nof the lowest-mass galaxies with optical signatures of AGN activity. We show\nthat RGG 119, the one object which has both a measured $\\sigma_{\\ast}$ and\npersistent broad H$\\alpha$ emission, falls near the extrapolation of the $\\rm\nM_{BH}-\\sigma_{\\star}$ relation to the low-mass end.\n", "  We report optical spectroscopic observations of the Be/gamma-ray binaries\nLSI+61303, MWC 148 and MWC 656. The peak separation and equivalent widths of\nprominent emission lines (H-alpha, H-beta, H-gamma, HeI, and FeII) are\nmeasured. We estimated the circumstellar disc size, compared it with separation\nbetween the components, and discussed the disc truncation. We find that in\nLSI+61303 the compact object comes into contact with the outer parts of the\ncircumstellar disc at periastron, in MWC 148 the compact object goes deeply\ninto the disc during the periastron passage, and in MWC 656 the black hole is\naccreting from the outer parts of the circumstellar disc along the entire\norbit.\n  The interstellar extinction was estimated using interstellar lines. The\nrotation of the mass donors appears to be similar to the rotation of the mass\ndonors in Be/X-ray binaries. We suggest that X-ray/optical periodicity of about\n1 day deserves to be searched for.\n", "  We present an exact RG (renormalization group) analysis of $O(N)$-invariant\nscalar field theory about the Gaussian fixed point. We prove a series of\nstatements that taken together show that the non-polynomial eigen-perturbations\nfound in the LPA (local potential approximation) at the linearised level, do\nnot lead to new interactions, \\textit{i.e.} enlarge the universality class,\nneither in the LPA or treated exactly. Non-perturbatively, their RG flow does\nnot emanate from the fixed point. For the equivalent Wilsonian effective action\nthey can be re-expressed in terms of the usual couplings to polynomial\ninteractions, which can furthermore be tuned to be as small as desired for all\nfinite RG time. For the infrared cutoff Legendre effective action, this can\nalso be done for the infrared evolution. We explain why this is nevertheless\nconsistent with the fact that the large field behaviour is fixed by these\nperturbations.\n", "  If a new high-mass resonance is discovered at the Large Hadron Collider,\nmodel-independent techniques to identify the production mechanism will be\ncrucial to understand its nature and effective couplings to Standard Model\nparticles. We present a powerful and model-independent method to infer the\ninitial state in the production of any high-mass color-singlet system by using\na tight veto on accompanying hadronic jets to divide the data into two mutually\nexclusive event samples (jet bins). For a resonance of several hundred GeV, the\njet binning cut needed to discriminate quark and gluon initial states is in the\nexperimentally accessible range of several tens of GeV. It also yields\ncomparable cross sections for both bins, making this method viable already with\nthe small event samples available shortly after a discovery. Theoretically, the\nmethod is made feasible by utilizing an effective field theory setup to compute\nthe jet cut dependence precisely and model independently and to systematically\ncontrol all sources of theoretical uncertainties in the jet binning, as well as\ntheir correlations. We use a 750 GeV scalar resonance as an example to\ndemonstrate the viability of our method.\n", "  The $s$-process nucleosynthesis in Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars\ndepends on the modeling of convective boundaries. We present models and\ns-process simulations that adopt a treatment of convective boundaries based on\nthe results of hydrodynamic simulations and on the theory of mixing due to\ngravity waves in the vicinity of convective boundaries. Hydrodynamics\nsimulations suggest the presence of convective boundary mixing (CBM) at the\nbottom of the thermal pulse-driven convective zone. Similarly,\nconvection-induced mixing processes are proposed for the mixing below the\nconvective envelope during third dredge-up where the 13C pocket for the s\nprocess in AGB stars forms. In this work we apply a CBM model motivated by\nsimulations and theory to models with initial mass $M = 2$ and $M = 3M_\\odot$,\nand with initial metal content Z = 0.01 and Z = 0.02. As reported previously,\nthe He-intershell abundance of 12C and 16O are increased by CBM at the bottom\nof pulse-driven convection zone. This mixing is affecting the\n$^{22}Ne(\\alpha,n)^{25}Mg$ activation and the s-process effciency in the\n13C-pocket. In our model CBM at the bottom of the convective envelope during\nthe third dredgeup represents gravity wave mixing. We take further into account\nthat hydrodynamic simulations indicate a declining mixing efficiency already\nabout a pressure scale height from the convective boundaries, compared to\nmixing-length theory. We obtain the formation of the 13C-pocket with a mass of\n$\\approx 10^{-4}M_\\odot$. The final $s$-process abundances are characterized by\n0.36 < [s=Fe] < 0.78 and the heavy-to-light s-process ratio is 0.23 < [hs=ls] <\n0.45. Finally, we compare our results with stellar observations, pre-solar\ngrain measurements and previous work.\n", "  We study sharp peaks in the conductance-voltage characteristics of a double\nquantum dot and a quantum dot spin-valve that are located around zero bias. The\npeaks share similarities with a Kondo peak but can be clearly distinguished, in\nparticular as they occur at high temperatures. The underlying physical\nmechanism is a strong current suppression that is quenched in bias-voltage\ndependent ways by exchange interactions. Our theoretical results are based on\nthe quantum master equation methodology, including the Born-Markov\napproximation and a numerically exact, hierarchical scheme, which we extend\nhere to the spin-valve case. The comparison of exact and approximate results\nallows us to reveal the underlying physical mechanisms, the role of first-,\nsecond- and beyond-second-order processes and the robustness of the effect.\n", "  One of the most promising electromagnetic signatures of compact object\nmergers are kilonovae: approximately isotropic radioactively-powered transients\nthat peak days to weeks post-merger. Key uncertainties in modeling kilonovae\ninclude the emission profiles of the radioactive decay products---non-thermal\nbeta- and alpha-particles, fission fragments, and gamma-rays---and the\nefficiency with which they deposit their energy in the ejecta. The total\nradioactive energy and the efficiency of its thermalization sets the luminosity\nbudget and is therefore necessary for predicting kilonova light curves. We\noutline the uncertainties in r-process decay, describe the physical processes\nby which the energy of the decay products is absorbed in the ejecta, and\npresent time-dependent thermalization efficiencies for each particle type. We\ndetermine the net heating efficiency and explore its dependence on r-process\nyields---in particular, the production of translead nuclei that undergo\nalpha-decay---and on the ejecta's mass, velocity, composition, and magnetic\nfield configuration. We incorporate our results into new time-dependent,\nmulti-wavelength radiation transport simulations, and calculate updated\npredictions of kilonova light curves. Thermalization has a substantial effect\non kilonova photometry, reducing the luminosity by a factor of roughly 2 at\npeak, and by an order of magnitude or more at later times (15 days or more\nafter explosion). We present simple analytic fits to time-dependent net\nthermalization efficiencies, which can easily be used to improve light curve\nmodels. We briefly revisit the putative kilonova that accompanied gamma ray\nburst 130603B, and offer new estimates of the mass ejected in that event. We\nfind that later-time kilonova light curves can be significantly impacted by\nalpha-decay from translead isotopes; data at these times may therefore be\ndiagnostic of ejecta abundances.\n", "  Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interference is demonstrated experimentally for\nentangled photon pairs in the Hermite-Gauss (HG) basis. We use two Dove prisms\nin one of the paths of the photons to manipulate the entangled quantum state\nthat enters the HOM interferometer. It is demonstrated that, when entangled\nphoton pairs are in a symmetric Bell state in the Laguerre-Gauss (LG) basis,\nthen they will remain symmetric after decomposing them into the HG basis,\nthereby resulting in no coincidence events after the HOM interference. On the\nother hand, if the photon pairs are in an antisymmetric Bell state in the LG\nbasis, then they will also be antisymmetric in the HG basis, thereby producing\nonly coincidence events as a result of the HOM interference.\n", "  Bit commitment is a fundamental cryptographic primitive in which a party\nwishes to commit a secret bit to another party. Perfect security between\nmistrustful parties is unfortunately impossible to achieve through the\nasynchronous exchange of classical and quantum messages. Perfect security can\nnonetheless be achieved if each party splits into two agents exchanging\nclassical information at times and locations satisfying strict relativistic\nconstraints. A relativistic multi-round protocol to achieve this was previously\nproposed and used to implement a 2~millisecond commitment time. Much longer\ndurations were initially thought to be insecure, but recent theoretical\nprogress showed that this is not so. In this letter, we report on the\nimplementation of a 24-hour bit commitment based on timed high-speed optical\ncommunication and fast data processing only, with all agents located within the\ncity of Geneva. This duration is more than six orders of magnitude longer than\nbefore, and we argue that it could be extended to one year and allow much more\nflexibility on the locations of the agents. Our implementation offers a\npractical and viable solution for use in applications such as digital\nsignatures, secure voting and honesty-preserving auctions.\n", "  The space density distribution of galaxies in the absolute magnitude -\nrotation velocity plane: a volume-complete Tully-Fisher relation from CALIFA\nstellar kinematics\n", "  Since the pioneering work of Ramsey, atom interferometers are employed for\nprecision metrology, in particular to measure time and to realize the second.\nIn a classical interferometer, an ensemble of atoms is prepared in one of the\ntwo input states, whereas the second one is left empty. In this case, the\nvacuum noise restricts the precision of the interferometer to the standard\nquantum limit (SQL). Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a novel\nclock configuration that surpasses the SQL by squeezing the vacuum in the empty\ninput state. We create a squeezed vacuum state containing an average of 0.75\natoms to improve the clock sensitivity of 10,000 atoms by 2.05 dB. The SQL\nposes a significant limitation for today's microwave fountain clocks, which\nserve as the main time reference. We evaluate the major technical limitations\nand challenges for devising a next generation of fountain clocks based on\natomic squeezed vacuum.\n", "  Higgs boson production in association with a $Z$-boson at the LHC is\nanalysed, both in the Standard Model and in Simplified Model extensions for\nDark Matter. We focus on $H\\rightarrow$invisibles searches and show that\nloop-induced components for both the signal and background present\nphenomenologically relevant contributions to the\n$\\mathcal{BR}(H\\rightarrow\\textit{inv})$ limits. In addition, the constraining\npower of this channel to Simplified Models for Dark Matter with scalar and\npseudo-scalar mediators $\\phi$ and $A$ is discussed and compared with\nnon-collider constraints. We find that with $100~fb^{-1}$ of LHC data, this\nchannel provides competitive constraints to the non-collider bounds, for most\nof the parameter space we consider, bounding the universal Standard Model\nfermion-mediator strength at $g_v < 1$ for moderate masses in the range of\n${100~\\text{GeV}<m_{\\phi/A}<400}$ GeV.\n", "  A long-standing question for avant-grade data storage technology concerns the\nnature of the ultrafast photoinduced phase transformations in the wide class of\nchalcogenide phase-change materials (PCMs). Overall, a comprehensive\nunderstanding of the microstructural evolution and the relevant kinetics\nmechanisms accompanying the out-of-equilibrium phases is still missing. Here,\nafter overheating a phase-change chalcogenide superlattice by an ultrafast\nlaser pulse, we indirectly track the lattice relaxation by time resolved X-ray\nabsorption spectroscopy (tr-XAS) with a sub-ns time resolution. The novel\napproach to the tr-XAS experimental results reported in this work provides an\natomistic insight of the mechanism that takes place during the cooling process,\nmeanwhile a first-principles model mimicking the microscopic distortions\naccounts for a straightforward representation of the observed dynamics.\nFinally, we envisage that our approach can be applied in future studies\naddressing the role of dynamical structural strain in phase-change materials.\n", "  We calculate the spectrum of the Andreev boundary modes in a two-dimensional\nsuperconductor formed at an interface between two different non-superconducting\nmaterials, e.g. insulating oxides. Inversion symmetry is absent in this system,\nand both the electron band structure and the superconducting pairing are\nstrongly affected by the spin-orbit coupling of the Rashba type. We consider\nisotropic s-wave pairing states, both with and without time-reversal symmetry\nbreaking, as well as various d-wave states. In all cases, there exist subgap\nAndreev boundary states, whose properties, in particular, the number and\nlocation of the zero-energy modes, qualitatively depend on the gap symmetry and\nthe spin-orbit coupling strength.\n", "  We point out that tensor consistency relations-i.e. the behavior of\nprimordial correlation functions in the limit a tensor mode has a small\nmomentum-are more universal than scalar consistency relations. They hold in the\npresence of multiple scalar fields and as long as anisotropies are diluted\nexponentially fast. When de Sitter isometries are approximately respected\nduring inflation this is guaranteed by the Higuchi bound, which forbids the\nexistence of light particles with spin: De Sitter space can support scalar hair\nbut no curly hair. We discuss two indirect ways to look for the violation of\ntensor con- sistency relations in observations, as a signature of models in\nwhich inflation is not a strong isotropic attractor, such as solid inflation:\n(a) Graviton exchange contribution to the scalar four-point function; (b)\nQuadrupolar anisotropy of the scalar power spectrum due to super-horizon tensor\nmodes. This anisotropy has a well-defined statistics which can be distinguished\nfrom cases in which the background has a privileged direction.\n", "  We show that for lattice-mismatched zinc-blende-type (110)-grown quantum\nwells a significant contribution to the zero-magnetic-field spin splitting of\nelectron subbands comes from strain-induced spin-orbit coupling. Combining\nenvelope function theory and atomistic tight-binding approach we calculate\nspin-orbit splitting constants for realistic quantum wells. It is found that\nthe strain due to lattice mismatch in conventional GaAs/AlGaAs structures may\nnoticeably modify the spin splitting while in InGaAs/GaAs structures it plays a\nmajor role and may even change the sign of the spin splitting constant.\n", "  We observed 146 Galactic clumps in HCN (4-3) and CS (7-6) with the Atacama\nSubmillimeter Telescope Experiment (ASTE) 10-m telescope. A tight linear\nrelationship between star formation rate and gas mass traced by dust continuum\nemission was found for both Galactic clumps and the high redshift (z>1) star\nforming galaxies (SFGs), indicating a constant gas depletion time of ~100 Myr\nfor molecular gas in both Galactic clumps and high z SFGs. However, low z\ngalaxies do not follow this relation and seem to have a longer global gas\ndepletion time. The correlations between total infrared luminosities (L_TIR)\nand molecular line luminosities (L'_mol) of HCN (4-3) and CS (7-6) are tight\nand sublinear extending down to clumps with LTIR~10^{3} L_sun. These\ncorrelations become linear when extended to external galaxies. A bimodal\nbehavior in the LTIR--L'mol correlations was found for clumps with different\ndust temperature, luminosity-to-mass ratio, and sigmaline/sigmavir. Such\nbimodal behavior may be due to evolutionary effects. The slopes of LTIR--L'mol\ncorrelations become more shallow as clumps evolve. We compared our results with\nlower J transition lines in wu et al. (2010). The correlations between clump\nmasses and line luminosities are close to linear for low effective excitation\ndensity tracers but become sublinear for high effective excitation density\ntracers for clumps with LTIR larger than LTIR~10^4.5 Lsun. High effective\nexcitation density tracers cannot linearly trace the total clump masses,\nleading to a sublinear correlations for both Mclump-L'mol and LTIR-L'mol\nrelations.\n", "  The energy of exchange coupled antiferromagnetic insulators (AFMIs) is a\nperiodic function of the relative in-plane orientation of the N\\'{e}el vector\nfields. We show that this leads to oscillations in the relative magnetization\nof exchange coupled AFMIs separated by a thin metallic barrier. These\noscillations pump a spin current ($I_{S}$) through the metallic spacer that is\nproportional to the rate of change of the relative in-plane orientation of the\nN\\'{e}el vector fields. By considering spin-transfer torque induced by a spin\nchemical potential ($V_{S}$) at one of the interfaces, we predict non-Ohmic\n$I_{S}$-$V_{S}$ characteristics of AFMI exchange coupled hetero-structures,\nwhich leads to a non-local voltage across a spin-orbit coupled metallic spacer.\n", "  We show theoretically that a photonic topological insulator can support edge\nsolitons that are strongly self-localized and propagate unidirectionally along\nthe lattice edge. The photonic topological insulator consists of a Floquet\nlattice of coupled helical waveguides, in a medium with local Kerr\nnonlinearity. The soliton behavior is strongly affected by the topological\nphase of the linear lattice. The topologically nontrivial phase gives a\ncontinuous family of solitons, while the topologically trivial phase gives an\nembedded soliton that occurs at a single power, and arises from a self-induced\nlocal nonlinear shift in the inter-site coupling. The solitons can be used for\nnonlinear switching and logical operations, functionalities that have not yet\nbeen explored in topological photonics. We demonstrate using solitons to\nperform selective filtering via propagation through a narrow channel, and using\nsoliton collisions for optical switching.\n", "  The crucial role of hydrodynamic pinch-off instabilities is evidenced in the\ncoarsening stage of viscous liquids. The phase separation of a barium\nborosilicate glass melt is studied by in-situ synchrotron X-Ray tomography at\nhigh temperature. The high viscosity contrast between the less viscous phase\nand the more viscous phase induces a topological symmetry breaking: capillary\nbreakups occur preferentially in the less viscous phase. As a result,\ncontrasting morphologies are obtained in the two phases. This symmetry breaking\nis illustrated on three different glass compositions , corresponding to\ndifferent volume fractions of the two phases. In particular, a fragmentation\nphenomenon, reminiscent of the end-pinching mechanism proposed by Stone et al.\n[1, 2] is evidenced in the less viscous phase.\n", "  We present a first-principle study of anomaly induced transport phenomena by\nperforming real-time lattice simulations with dynamical fermions coupled\nsimultaneously to non-Abelian $SU(N_c)$ and Abelian $U(1)$ gauge fields.\nInvestigating the behavior of vector and axial currents during a sphaleron\ntransition in the presence of an external magnetic field, we demonstrate how\nthe interplay of the Chiral magnetic (CME) and Chiral separation effect (CSE)\nlead to the formation of a propagating wave. We further analyze the dependence\nof the magnitude of the induced vector current and the propagation of the wave\non the amount of explicit chiral symmetry breaking due to finite quark mass.\n", "  We have used the 150 MHz radio continuum survey (TGSS ADR) from the Giant\nMetrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) to search for phase-averaged emission toward\nall well-localized radio pulsars north of -53deg Declination. We detect\nemission toward 200 pulsars with high confidence (>=5-sigma) and another 88\npulsars at fainter levels. We show that most of our identifications are likely\nfrom pulsars, except for a small number where the measured flux density is\nconfused by an associated supernova or pulsar-wind nebula, or a globular\ncluster. We investigate the radio properties of the 150 MHz sample and we find\nan unusually high number of gamma-ray binary millisecond pulsars with very\nsteep spectral indices. We also note a discrepancy in the measured flux\ndensities between GMRT and LOFAR pulsar samples, suggesting that the flux\ndensity scale for the LOFAR pulsar sample may be in error by approximately a\nfactor two. We carry out a separate search of 30 well-localized gamma-ray,\nradio-quiet pulsars in an effort to detect a widening of the radio beam into\nthe line-of-sight at lower frequencies. No steep spectrum emission was detected\neither toward individual pulsars or in a weighted stack of all 30 images.\n", "  When a neutron star accretes matter from a companion star in a low-mass X-ray\nbinary, the accreted gas settles onto the stellar surface through a\nboundary/spreading layer. On rare occasions the accumulated gas undergoes a\npowerful thermonuclear superburst powered by carbon burning deep below the\nneutron star atmosphere. In this paper, we apply the non-negative matrix\nfactorization spectral decomposition technique to show that the spectral\nvariations during a superburst from 4U 1636-536 can be explained by two\ndistinct components: 1) the superburst emission characterized by a variable\ntemperature black body radiation component, and 2) a quasi-Planckian component\nwith a constant, $\\sim$2.5 keV, temperature varying by a factor of $\\sim$15 in\nflux. The spectrum of the quasi-Planckian component is identical in shape and\ncharacteristics to the frequency-resolved spectra observed in the\naccretion/persistent spectrum of neutron star low-mass X-ray binaries, and\nagrees well with the predictions of the spreading layer model by Inogamov &\nSunyaev (1999). Our result is yet another observational evidence that\nsuperbursts - and possibly also normal X-ray bursts - induce changes in the\ndisc-star boundary.\n", "  The internal structure of gas giant planets may be more complex than the\ncommonly assumed core-envelope structure with an adiabatic temperature profile.\nDifferent primordial internal structures as well as various physical processes\ncan lead to non-homogenous compositional distributions. A non-homogenous\ninternal structure has a significant impact on the thermal evolution and final\nstructure of the planets. In this paper, we present alternative structure and\nevolution models for Jupiter and Saturn allowing for non-adiabatic primordial\nstructures and the mixing of heavy elements by convection as these planets\nevolve. We present the evolution of the planets accounting for various initial\ncomposition gradients, and in the case of Saturn, include the formation of a\nhelium-rich region as a result of helium rain. We investigate the stability of\nregions with composition gradients against convection, and find that the helium\nshell in Saturn remains stable and does not mix with the rest of the envelope.\nIn other cases, convection mixes the planetary interior despite the existence\nof compositional gradients, leading to the enrichment of the envelope with\nheavy elements. We show that non-adiabatic structures (and cooling histories)\nfor both Jupiter and Saturn are feasible. The interior temperatures in that\ncase are much higher that for standard adiabatic models. We conclude that the\ninternal structure is directly linked to the formation and evolution history of\nthe planet. These alternative internal structures of Jupiter and Saturn should\nbe considered when interpreting the upcoming Juno and Cassini data.\n", "  We provide a variant model of strongly interacting massive particle (SIMP),\nwhere composite dark matter comes from a strongly interacting U(1) theory. We\nfirst explain a non-Abelian version of the model with an additional singlet\nfield, which is mixed with the Higgs field to maintain the kinetic equilibrium\nbetween the hidden and Standard Model (SM) sectors. The mixing leads to signals\nthat would be detected by future collider experiments, direct DM detection\nexperiments, and beam-dump experiments. Then we investigate a U(1) theory with\na scalar monopole, where U(1) charged particles are confined by monopole\ncondensation. In this model, the radial component of monopole can mix with the\nHiggs field, so that we do not need to introduce the additional singlet field.\n", "  The superfluid mixture of interacting Bose and Fermi species is a remarkable\nmany-body quantum system. Dilute degenerate atomic gases, especially for two\nspecies of distinct masses, are excellent candidates for exploring fundamental\nfeatures of superfluid mixture. However, producing a mass-imbalance Bose-Fermi\nsuperfluid mixture, providing an unambiguous visual proof of two-species\nsuperfluidity and probing inter-species interaction effects remain challenging.\nHere, we report the realization of a two-species superfluid of lithium-6 and\npotassium-41. By rotating the dilute gases, we observe the simultaneous\nexistence of vortex lattices in both species, and thus present a definitive\nvisual evidence for the simultaneous superfluidity of the two species.\nPronounced effects of the inter-species interaction are demonstrated through a\nseries of precision measurements on the formation and decay of two-species\nvortices. Our system provides a new platform for studying novel macroscopic\nquantum phenomena in vortex matter of interacting species.\n", "  In current models for jets of AGNs and their emission a shortcoming in the\ndescription and understanding of the connection between the largest and\nsmallest scales exists. In this work we present a spatially resolved SSC model\nextended to parsec scales, which opens the possibility of probing the\nconnections between the radio and high energy properties. We simulate an\nenvironment that leads to Fermi-I acceleration of leptonic particles and\nincludes the full time dependence of this process. Omitting the restriction of\na finite downstream region, we find that the spectral energy distribution (SED)\nproduced by the accelerated particles strongly depends on their radial\nconfinement behind the shock. The requirement, for both the restriction of high\nenergy emission to a small region around the shock and the production of a flat\nradio spectrum, is an initial linear increase of the radius immediately behind\nthe shock, which then slows down with increasing distance from the shock. A\ngood representation of the data for the Blazar \\textit{Mkn501} is achieved by a\nparameterized log-function. The prediction for the shape of the radio blob is\ngiven by the flux distribution with respect to shock distance.\n", "  We perform extensive molecular dynamics simulations of a charged polymer in a\ngood solvent in the regime where the chain is collapsed. We analyze the\ndependence of the gyration radius $R_g $ on the reduced Bjerrum length $\\ell_B$\nand find two different regimes. In the first one, called as a weak\nelectrostatic regime, $R_g \\sim \\ell_B^{-1/2}$, which is consistent only with\nthe predictions of the counterion-fluctuation theory. In the second one, called\na strong electrostatic regime, we find $R_g \\sim \\ell_B^{-1/5}$. To explain the\nnovel regime we modify the counterion-fluctuation theory.\n", "  We consider the electroweak production of a top quark in association with a\nphoton at the LHC to probe the electroweak top quark couplings\n(t$\\bar{\\text{t}}\\gamma$) as well as the triple gauge boson couplings\n(WW$\\gamma$). The study is based on the modifications of the\nt$\\bar{\\text{t}}\\gamma$ and WW$\\gamma$ interactions via heavy degrees of\nfreedom in the form of dimension-six operators which we add to the standard\nmodel Lagrangian. A binned angular asymmetry in single top quark plus photon\nevents and cross section ratio are proposed to probe the anomalous\n  t$\\bar{\\text{t}}\\gamma$ and WW$\\gamma$ couplings. It is shown that the\nproposed angular asymmetry can distinguish anomalous t$\\bar{\\text{t}}\\gamma$,\nWW$\\gamma$ couplings from the standard model prediction and yield a great\nsensitivity.\n", "  The existence of gender differences in student performance on conceptual\nassessments and their responses to attitudinal assessments has been repeatedly\ndemonstrated. This difference is often present in students' preinstruction\nresponses and persists in their postinstruction responses. However, one area in\nwhich the presence of gender differences has not been extensively explored is\nundergraduate laboratory courses. For example, one of the few laboratory\nfocused research-based assessments, the Colorado Learning Attitudes about\nScience Survey for Experimental Physics (E-CLASS), has not been tested for the\nexistence of gender differences in students' responses. Here, we utilize a\nnational data set of responses to the E-CLASS to determine if they demonstrate\nsignificant gender differences. We also investigate how these differences vary\nalong multiple student and course demographic slices, including course level\n(first-year vs.\\ beyond-first-year) and major (physics vs.\\ non-physics). We\nobserve a gender gap in pre- and postinstruction E-CLASS scores in the\naggregate data both for the overall score and for most items individually.\nHowever, for some subpopulations (e.g., beyond-first-year students) the size or\neven existence of the gender gap depends on another dimension (e.g., student\nmajor). We also find that for all groups the gap in postinstruction scores\nvanishes or is greatly reduced when controlling for preinstruction scores,\ncourse level, and student major.\n", "  We present relativistic analyses of 9257 measurements of times-of-arrival\nfrom the first binary pulsar, PSR B1913+16, acquired over the last thirty-five\nyears. The determination of the 'Keplerian' orbital elements plus two\nrelativistic terms completely characterizes the binary system, aside from an\nunknown rotation about the line of sight; leading to a determination of the\nmasses of the pulsar and its companion: 1.438 $\\pm$ 0.001 solar masses and\n1.390 $\\pm$ 0.001 solar masses, respectively. In addition, the complete system\ncharacterization allows the creation of tests of relativistic gravitation by\ncomparing measured and predicted sizes of various relativistic phenomena. We\nfind that the ratio of observed orbital period decrease due to gravitational\nwave damping (corrected by a kinematic term) to the general relativistic\nprediction, is 0.9983 pm 0.0016; thereby confirming the existence and strength\nof gravitational radiation as predicted by general relativity. For the first\ntime in this system, we have also successfully measured the two parameters\ncharacterizing the Shapiro gravitational propagation delay, and find that their\nvalues are consistent with general relativistic predictions. We have also\nmeasured for the first time in any system the relativistic shape correction to\nthe elliptical orbit, $\\delta_{\\theta}$,although its intrinsic value is\nobscured by currently unquantified pulsar emission beam aberration. We have\nalso marginally measured the time derivative of the projected semimajor axis,\nwhich, when improved in combination with beam aberration modelling from\ngeodetic precession observations, should ultimately constrain the pulsar's\nmoment of inertia.\n", "  We study the problem of certifying quantum steering in a\ndetection-loophole-free manner in experimental situations that require\npost-selection. We present a method to find the modified local-hidden-state\nbound of steering inequalities in such a post-selected scenario. We then\npresent a construction of linear steering inequalities in arbitrary finite\ndimension and show that they certify steering in a loophole-free manner as long\nas the detection efficiencies are above the known bound below which steering\ncan never be demonstrated. We also show how our method extends to the scenarios\nof multipartite steering and Bell nonlocality, in the general case where there\ncan be correlations between the losses of the different parties. In both cases\nwe present examples to demonstrate the techniques developed.\n", "  Most of our knowledge of planets orbiting nearby stars comes from Doppler\nsurveys. For spaced-based, high-contrast imaging missions, nearby stars with\nDoppler-discovered planets are attractive targets. The known orbits tell\nimaging missions where and when to observe, and the dynamically-determined\nmasses provide important constraints for the interpretation of planetary\nspectra. Quantifying the set of planet masses and orbits that could have been\ndetected will enable more efficient planet discovery and characterization. We\nanalyzed Doppler measurements from Lick and Keck Observatories collected by the\nCalifornia Planet Survey. We focused on stars that are likely targets for three\nspace-based planet imaging mission concepts studied by NASA--WFIRST-AFTA,\nExo-C, and Exo-S. The Doppler targets are primarily F8 and later main sequence\nstars, with observations spanning 1987-2014. We identified 76 stars with\nDoppler measurements from the prospective mission target lists. We developed an\nautomated planet search and a methodology to estimate the pipeline completeness\nusing injection and recovery tests. We applied this machinery to the Doppler\ndata and computed planet detection limits for each star as a function of planet\nminimum mass and semi-major axis. For typical stars in the survey, we are\nsensitive to approximately Saturn-mass planets inside of 1 AU, Jupiter-mass\nplanets inside of ~3 AU, and our sensitivity declines out to ~10 AU. For the\nbest Doppler targets, we are sensitive to Neptune-mass planets in 3 AU orbits.\nUsing an idealized model of Doppler survey completeness, we forecast the\nprecision of future surveys of non-ideal Doppler targets that are likely\ntargets of imaging missions.\n", "  We present the closed loop approach to linear nonequilibrium thermodynamics\nconsidering a generic heat engine dissipatively connected to two temperature\nbaths. The system is usually quite generally characterized by two parameters:\nthe output power $P$ and the conversion efficiency $\\eta$, to which we add a\nthird one, the working frequency $\\omega$. We establish that a detailed\nunderstanding of the effects of the dissipative coupling on the energy\nconversion process, necessitates the knowledge of only two quantities: the\nsystem's feedback factor $\\beta$ and its open-loop gain $A_{0}$, the product of\nwhich, $A_{0}\\beta$, characterizes the interplay between the efficiency, the\noutput power and the operating rate of the system. By placing thermodynamics\nanalysis on a higher level of abstraction, the feedback loop approach provides\na versatile and economical, hence a very efficient, tool for the study of\n\\emph{any} conversion engine operation for which a feedback factor may be\ndefined.\n", "  We calculate the distribution of the size of the percolating cluster on a\ntree in the subcritical, critical and supercritical phase. We do this by\nexploiting a mapping between continuum trees and Brownian excursions, and\narrive at a diffusion equation with suitable boundary conditions. The exact\nsolution to this equation can be conveniently represented as a characteristic\nfunction, from which the following distributions are clearly visible: Gaussian\n(subcritical), Kolmogorov-Smirnov (critical) and exponential (supercritical).\nIn this way we provide an intuitive explanation for the result reported in R.\nBotet and M. Ploszajczak, Phys. Rev. Lett 95, 185702 (2005) for critical\npercolation.\n", "  Supergranulation is characterized by horizontally divergent flows with\ntypical length scales of 32 Mm in the solar photosphere. Unlike granulation,\nthe size of which is comparable to both the thickness of the radiative boundary\nlayer and local scale height of the plasma in the photosphere, supergranulation\ndoes not reflect any obvious length scale of the solar convection zone. Early\nsuggestions that the depth of second helium ionization is important are not\nsupported by numerical simulations. Thus the origin of the solar\nsupergranulation remains largely a mystery. Moreover, observations of flows in\nthe photosphere using either Doppler imaging or correlation or feature tracking\nshow a monotonic decrease in power at scales larger than supergranulation. Both\nlocal area and global spherical shell simulations of solar convection by\ncontrast show the opposite, a power law increase in horizontal flow amplitudes\nto low wavenumber. Here we examine this disparity, and investigate how the\nsolar supergranulation may arise as a consequence of strong photospheric\ndriving and non-local heat transport by cool diving plumes. Using three\ndimensional anelastic simulations with surface driving, we show that the\nkinetic energy of largest convective scales in the upper layers of a stratified\ndomain reflects the depth of transition from strong buoyant driving to\nadiabatic stratification below. We interpret the observed monotonic decrease in\nsolar convective power at scales larger than supergranulation to be a\nconsequence of this rapid transition, and show how the supergranular scale can\nbe understood as the largest buoyantly driven mode of convection in the Sun.\n", "  The determination of the age of the bulge has led to two contradictory\nresults. On the one side, the color-magnitude diagrams in different bulge\nfields seem to indicate a uniformly old ($>$10 Gyr) population. On the other\nside, individual ages derived from dwarfs observed through microlensing events\nseem to indicate a large spread, from $\\sim$ 2 to $\\sim$ 13 Gyr. Because the\nbulge is now recognised as being mainly a boxy peanut-shaped bar, it is\nsuggested that disk stars are one of its main constituents, and therefore also\nstars with ages significantly younger than 10 Gyr. Other arguments as well\npoint to the fact that the bulge cannot be exclusively old, and in particular\ncannot be a burst population, as it is usually expected if the bulge was the\nfossil remnant of a merger phase in the early Galaxy. In the present study, we\nshow that given the range of metallicities observed in the bulge, a uniformly\nold population would be reflected into a significant spread in color at the\nturn-off which is not observed. Inversely, we demonstrate that the correlation\nbetween age and metallicity expected to hold for the inner disk would conspire\nto form a color-magnitude diagram with a remarkably small spread in color, thus\nmimicking the color-magnitude diagram of a uniformly old population. If stars\nyounger than 10 Gyr are part of the bulge, as must be the case if the bulge has\nbeen mainly formed through dynamical instabilities in the disk, then a very\nsmall spread at the turn-off is expected, as seen in the observations.\n", "  IceCube observed high-energy neutrino flux in the energy region from TeV to\nPeV. The decay of a massive long-lived particle in the early universe can be\nthe origin of the IceCube neutrino events, which we call an \"early decay\nscenario.\" In this paper, we construct a particle physics model that contains\nsuch a massive long-lived particle based on the Peccei-Quinn model. We\ncalculate the present neutrino flux, taking account of realistic initial energy\ndistributions of particles produced by the decay of the massive long-lived\nparticle. We show that the early decay scenario naturally fits into the\nPeccei-Quinn model, and that the neutrino flux observed by IceCube can be\nexplained in such a framework. We also see that, based on that model, a\nconsistent cosmological history that explains the abundance of the massive\nlong-lived particle is realized.\n", "  We derive gluon fragmentation functions in the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model\nby treating a gluon as a pair of color lines formed by fictitious quark and\nanti-quark ($q\\bar q$). Gluon elementary fragmentation functions are obtained\nfrom the quark and anti-quark elementary fragmentation functions for emitting\nspecific mesons in the NJL model under the requirement that the $q\\bar q$ pair\nmaintains in the flavor-singlet state after meson emissions. An integral\nequation, which iterates the gluon elementary fragmentation functions to all\norders, is then solved to yield the gluon fragmentation functions at a model\nscale. It is observed that these solutions are stable with respect to variation\nof relevant model parameters, especially after QCD evolution to a higher scale\nis implemented. We show that the inclusion of the gluon fragmentation functions\ninto the theoretical predictions from only the quark fragmentation functions\ngreatly improves the agreement with the SLD data for the pion and kaon\nproductions in $e^+e^-$ annihilation. Our proposal provides a plausible\nconstruct for the gluon fragmentation functions, which are supposed to be null\nin the NJL model.\n", "  Saturn formed beyond the snow line in the primordial solar nebula that made\nit possible for it to accrete a large mass. Disk instability and core accretion\nmodels have been proposed for Saturn's formation, but core accretion is favored\non the basis of its volatile abundances, internal structure, hydrodynamic\nmodels, chemical characteristics of protoplanetary disk, etc. The observed\nfrequency, properties and models of exoplanets provide additional supporting\nevidence for core accretion. The heavy elements with mass greater than 4He make\nup the core of Saturn, but are presently poorly constrained, except for carbon.\nThe C/H ratio is super-solar, and twice that in Jupiter. The enrichment of\ncarbon and other heavy elements in Saturn and Jupiter requires special delivery\nmechanisms for volatiles to these planets. In this chapter we will review our\ncurrent understanding of the origin and evolution of Saturn and its atmosphere,\nusing a multi-faceted approach that combines diverse sets of observations on\nvolatile composition and abundances, relevant properties of the moons and\nrings, comparison with the other gas giant planet, Jupiter, analogies to the\nextrasolar giant planets, as well as pertinent theoretical models.\n", "  A search for Higgs-boson pair production in the $b\\bar{b}b\\bar{b}$ final\nstate is carried out with 3.2 fb$^{-1}$ of proton--proton collision data\ncollected at $\\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV with the ATLAS detector. The data are\nconsistent with the estimated background and are used to set upper limits on\nthe production cross section of Higgs-boson pairs times branching ratio to\n$b\\bar{b}b\\bar{b}$ for both nonresonant and resonant production. In the case of\nresonant production of Kaluza--Klein gravitons within the Randall--Sundrum\nmodel, upper limits in the 24 to 91 fb range are obtained for masses between\n600 and 3000 GeV, at the 95% confidence level. The production cross section\ntimes branching ratio for nonresonant Higgs-boson pairs is also constrained to\nbe less than 1.22 pb, at the 95% confidence level.\n", "  Context: The chemical composition of stars is intimately linked to the Galaxy\nformation and evolution. Aims: We aim to trace the chemical evolution of the\nGalactic disk through the inspection of the [X/Fe]-age relations of 24 species\nfrom C to Eu. Methods: Using high-resolution and high-signal-to-noise UVES\nspectra of nine solar twins, we obtained precise estimates of stellar ages and\nchemical abundances. These determinations have been integrated with additional\naccurate age and abundance determinations from recent spectroscopic studies of\nsolar twins existing in the literature, comprising superb abundances with\n0.01~dex precision. Based on this data set, we outlined the [X/Fe]-age\nrelations over a time interval of 10~Gyr. Results: We present the [X/Fe] - age\nrelations for 24 elements (C, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, S, K, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn,\nCo, Ni, Cu, Zn, Y, Ba, La, Ce, Nd, and Eu). Each different class of elements\nshowed distinct evolution with time that relies on the different\ncharacteristics, rates and timescales of the nucleosynthesis' sites from which\nthey are produced. The $\\alpha$-elements are characterised by a [X/Fe]\ndecrement as time goes on. Strikingly, an opposite behaviour is observed for\nCa. The iron-peak elements show an early [X/Fe] increase followed by a decrease\ntowards the youngest stars. The [X/Fe] for the n-capture elements decrease with\nage. We also found that both [Mg/Y] and [Al/Y] are precise stellar clocks, with\n[Al/Y] showing the steepest dependence with age. Conslusions: Knowledge of the\n[X/Fe]-age relations is a gold mine from which we can achieve a great\nunderstanding about the processes that governed the formation and evolution of\nthe Milky Way. Through the reverse engineering of these relations we will be\nable to put strong constraints on the nature of the stellar formation history,\nthe SNe rates, the stellar yields, and the variety of the SNe progenitors.\n", "  We investigate the characteristics and the sources of the slow (< 450 km/s)\nsolar wind during the four years (2006-2009) of low solar activity between\nSolar Cycles 23 and 24. We use a comprehensive set of in-situ observations in\nthe near-Earth solar wind (Wind and ACE) and remove the periods when\nlarge-scale interplanetary coronal mass ejections were present. The\ninvestigated period features significant variations in the global coronal\nstructure, including the frequent presence of low-latitude active regions in\n2006-2007, long-lived low- and mid-latitude coronal holes in 2006 - mid-2008\nand mostly the quiet Sun in 2009. We examine both Carrington Rotation averages\nof selected solar plasma, charge state and compositional parameters and\ndistributions of these parameters related to Quiet Sun, Active Region Sun and\nthe Coronal Hole Sun. While some of the investigated parameters (e.g., speed,\nthe C^{+6}/C^{+4} and He/H ratio) show clear variations over our study period\nand with solar wind source type, some (Fe/O) exhibit very little changes. Our\nresults highlight the difficulty in distinguishing between the slow solar wind\nsources based on the inspection of the solar wind conditions.\n", "  We derive upper and lower bounds on the mass-radius ratio of stable compact\nobjects in extended gravity theories, in which modifications of the\ngravitational dynamics via-{\\' a}-vis standard general relativity are described\nby an effective contribution to the matter energy-momentum tensor. Our results\ninclude the possibility of a variable coupling between the matter sector and\nthe gravitational field and are valid for a large class of generalized gravity\nmodels. The generalized continuity and Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations are\nexpressed in terms of the effective mass, density and pressure, given by the\nbare values plus additional contributions from the total energy-momentum\ntensor, and general theoretical limits for the maximum and minimum mass-radius\nratios are explicitly obtained. As an applications of the formalism developed\nherein, we consider compact bosonic objects, described by scalar-tensor\ngravitational theories with self-interacting scalar field potentials, and\ncharged compact objects, respectively. For Higgs type models, we find that\nthese bounds can be expressed in terms of the value of the potential at the\nsurface of the compact object. Minimizing the energy with respect to the\nradius, we obtain explicit upper and lower bounds on the mass, which admits a\nChandrasekhar type representation. For charged compact objects, we consider the\neffects of the Poincar\\'{e} stresses on the equilibrium structure and obtain\nbounds on the radial and tangential stresses. As a possible astrophysical test\nof our results, we obtain the general bound on the gravitational redshift for\ncompact objects in extended gravity theories. General implications of minimum\nmass bounds for the gravitational stability of fundamental particles and for\nthe existence of holographic duality between bulk and boundary degrees of\nfreedom are also considered.\n", "  We compute the stochastic gravitational wave background generated by cosmic\nsuperstrings using a semi-analytical velocity-dependent model to describe their\ndynamics. We show that heavier string types may leave distinctive signatures on\nthe stochastic gravitational wave background spectrum within the reach of\npresent and upcoming gravitational wave detectors. We examine the physically\nmotivated scenario in which the physical size of loops is determined by the\ngravitational backreaction scale and use NANOGRAV data to derive a conservative\nconstraint of $G\\mu_F<3.2 \\times 10^{-9}$ on the tension of fundamental\nstrings. We demonstrate that approximating the gravitational wave spectrum\ngenerated by cosmic superstring networks using the spectrum generated by\nordinary cosmic strings with reduced intercommuting probability (which is often\ndone in the literature) leads, in general, to weaker observational constraints\non $G\\mu_F$. We show that the inclusion of heavier string types is required for\na more accurate characterization of the region of the $(g_s,G\\mu_F)$ parameter\nspace that may be probed using direct gravitational wave detectors. In\nparticular, we consider the observational constraints that result from NANOGRAV\ndata and show that heavier strings generate a secondary exclusion region of\nparameter space.\n", "  The structural and electronic properties of FeSe ultra-thin layers on\nBi$_{2}$Se$_{3}$ have been investigated with a combination of scanning\ntunneling microscopy and spectroscopy and angle-resolved photoemission\nspectroscopy. The FeSe multi-layers, which are predominantly 3-5 monolayers\n(ML) thick, exhibit a hole pocket-like electron band at \\bar{\\Gamma} and a\ndumbbell-like feature at \\bar{M}, similar to multi-layers of FeSe on\nSrTiO$_{3}$. Moreover, the topological state of the Bi2Se3 is preserved beneath\nthe FeSe layer, as indicated by a heavily \\it{n}-doped Dirac cone. Low\ntemperature STS does not exhibit a superconducting gap for any investigated\nthickness down to a temperature of 5 K.\n", "  The processing of energetic photons on bare silicate grains was simulated\nexperimentally on silicate films submitted to soft X-rays of energies up to\n1.25 keV. The silicate material was prepared by means of a microwave assisted\nsolgel technique. Its chemical composition reflects the Mg2SiO4 stoichiometry\nwith residual impurities due to the synthesis method. The experiments were\nperformed using the spherical grating monochromator beamline at the National\nSynchrotron Radiation Research Center in Taiwan. We found that soft X-ray\nirradiation induces structural changes that can be interpreted as an\namorphization of the processed silicate material. The present results may have\nrelevant implications in the evolution of silicate materials in X-ray\nirradiated protoplanetary disks.\n", "  As they combine decent mobilities with extremely long carrier lifetimes,\norganic-inorganic perovskites have opened a whole new field in\nopto\\-electronics. Measurements of their underlying electronic structure,\nhowever, are still lacking. Using angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy, we\nmeasure the valence band dispersion of single-crystal CH$_3$NH$_3$PbBr$_3$. The\ndispersion of the highest energy band is extracted applying a modified leading\nedge method, which accounts for the particular density of states of\norganic-inorganic perovskites. The surface Brillouin zone is consistent with\nbulk-terminated surfaces both in the low-temperature orthorhombic and the\nhigh-temperature cubic phase. In the low-temperature phase, we find a\nring-shaped valence band maximum with a radius of 0.043 {\\AA}$^{-1}$, centered\naround a 0.16 eV deep local minimum in the dispersion of the valence band at\nthe high-symmetry point. Intense circular dichroism is observed. This\ndispersion is the result of strong spin-orbit coupling. Spin-orbit coupling is\nalso present in the room-temperature phase. The coupling strength is one of the\nlargest reported so far.\n", "  We study a singlet scalar extension of the Standard Model. The singlet scalar\nis coupled non-minimally to gravity and assumed to drive inflation, and also\ncouple sufficiently strongly with the SM Higgs field in order to provide for a\nstrong first order electroweak phase transition. Requiring the model to\ndescribe inflation successfully, be compatible with the LHC data, and yield a\nstrong first order electroweak phase transition, we identify the regions of the\nparameter space where the model is viable. We also include a singlet fermion\nwith scalar coupling to the singlet scalar to probe the sensitivity of the\nconstraints on additional degrees of freedom and their couplings in the singlet\nsector. We also comment on the general feasibility of these fields to act as\ndark matter.\n", "  Hybrid improper ferroelectricity, where an electrical polarization can be\ninduced via a trilinear coupling to two non-polar structural distortions of\ndifferent symmetry, has recently been experimentally demonstrated for the first\ntime in the $n$=2 Ruddlesden-Popper compound Ca$_3$Ti$_2$O$_7$. In this paper\nwe use group theoretic methods and first-principles calculations to identify\npossible ferroelectric switching pathways in Ca$_3$Ti$_2$O$_7$. We identify\nlow-energy paths that reverse the polarization direction by switching via an\northorhombic twin domain, or via an antipolar structure. We also introduce a\nchemically intuitive set of local order parameters to give insight into how\nthese paths are relevant to switching nucleated at domain walls. Our findings\nsuggest that switching may proceed via more than one mechanism in this\nmaterial.\n", "  M3 and M13 are Galactic globular clusters with previous reports of\nsurrounding stellar halos. We present the results of a search for members and\nextratidal cluster halo stars within and outside of the tidal radius of these\nclusters in the LAMOST Data Release 1. We find seven candidate cluster members\n(inside the tidal radius) of both M3 and M13 respectively. In M3 we also\nidentify eight candidate extratidal cluster halo stars at distances up to ~9.8\ntimes the tidal radius, and in M13 we identify 12 candidate extratidal cluster\nhalo stars at distances up to ~13.8 times the tidal radius. These results\nsupport previous indications that both M3 and M13 are surrounded by extended\nstellar halos, and we find that the GC destruction rates corresponding to the\nobserved mass loss are generally significantly higher than theoretical studies\npredict.\n", "  We compare the variability properties of very high energy gamma-ray emitting\nBL Lac objects in the optical and radio bands. We use the variability\ninformation to distinguish multiple emission components in the jet, to be used\nas a guidance for spectral energy distribution modelling. Our sample includes\n32 objects in the Northern sky that have data for at least 2 years in both\nbands. We use optical R-band data from the Tuorla blazar monitoring program and\n15 GHz radio data from the Owens Valley Radio Observatory blazer monitoring\nprogram. We estimate the variability amplitudes using the intrinsic modulation\nindex, and study the time-domain connection by cross-correlating the optical\nand radio light curves assuming power law power spectral density. Our sample\nobjects are in general more variable in the optical than radio. We find\ncorrelated flares in about half of the objects, and correlated long-term trends\nin more than 40% of the objects. In these objects we estimate that at least\n10%-50% of the optical emission originates in the same emission region as the\nradio, while the other half is due to faster variations not seen in the radio.\nThis implies that simple single-zone spectral energy distribution models are\nnot adequate for many of these objects.\n", "  The study of the properties of disks around young brown dwarfs can provide\nimportant clues on the formation of these very low-mass objects and on the\npossibility of forming planetary systems around them. The presence of warm\ndusty disks around brown dwarfs is well known, based on near- and mid-infrared\nstudies. High angular resolution observations of the cold outer disk are\nlimited; we used ALMA to attempt a first survey of young brown dwarfs in the\n$\\rho$-Oph star-forming region. All 17 young brown dwarfs in our sample were\nobserved at 890 $\\mu $m in the continuum at $\\sim0.\\!^{\\prime\\prime}5$ angular\nresolution. The sensitivity of our observations was chosen to detect $\\sim0.5$\nM$_\\oplus$ of dust. We detect continuum emission in 11 disks ($\\sim65$\\%\\ of\nthe total), and the estimated mass of dust in the detected disks ranges from\n$\\sim0.5$ to $\\sim6$ M$_\\oplus$. These disk masses imply that planet formation\naround brown dwarfs may be relatively rare and that the supra-Jupiter mass\ncompanions found around some brown dwarfs are probably the result of a binary\nsystem formation. We find evidence that the two brightest disks in $\\rho$-Oph\nhave sharp outer edges at R<~25 AU, in contrast to disks around Taurus brown\ndwarfs. This difference may suggest that the different environment in\n$\\rho$-Oph may lead to significant differences in disk properties. A comparison\nof the M$_{disk}$/M$_\\ast$ ratio for brown dwarf and solar-mass systems also\nshows a possible deficit of mass in brown dwarfs, which could support the\nevidence for dynamical truncation of disks in the substellar regime. These\nfindings are still tentative and need to be put on firmer grounds by studying\nthe gaseous disks around brown dwarfs and by performing a more systematic and\nunbiased survey of the disk population around the more massive stars.\n", "  We study electron and spin transport in interacting quantum wires contacted\nby noninteracting leads. We theoretically model the wire and junctions as an\ninhomogeneous chain where the parameters at the junction change on the scale of\nthe lattice spacing. We study such systems analytically in the appropriate\nlimits based on Luttinger liquid theory and compare the results to quantum\nMonte Carlo calculations of the conductances and local densities near the\njunction. We first consider an inhomogeneous spinless fermion model with a\nnearest-neighbor interaction and then generalize our results to a spinful model\nwith an onsite Hubbard interaction.\n", "  We consider a one-dimensional cavity composed of two perfect, fixed mirrors\nand a mobile membrane in between. Assuming that the membrane starts to move\nfrom rest and that the membrane moves appreciably in a time-scale much larger\nthan the time-scale in which the cavity electromagnetic field evolves\nappreciably, we derive simple analytic formulas that describe to good\napproximation the evolution of the field and that provide an intuitive physical\npicture. These formulas take into account the position, velocity, and\nacceleration of the membrane and are valid for arbitrarily large displacements\nof the membrane along the cavity axis. Also, we deduce the conditions under\nwhich the field can be described to good approximation by a single\ninstantaneous mode.\n", "  Context: We study the impact of two-dimensional spherical shells on\ncompressible convection. Realistic profiles for density and temperature from a\none-dimensional stellar evolution code are used to produce a model of a large\nstellar convection zone representative of a young low-mass star.\n  Methods: We perform hydrodynamic implicit large-eddy simulations of\ncompressible convection using the MUltidimensional Stellar Implicit Code\n(MUSIC). Because MUSIC has been designed to use realistic stellar models\nproduced from one-dimensional stellar evolution calculations, MUSIC simulations\nare capable of seamlessly modeling a whole star. Simulations in two-dimensional\nspherical shells that have different radial extents are performed over hundreds\nof convective turnover times, permitting the collection of well-converged\nstatistics.\n  Results: We evaluate basic statistics of the convective turnover time, the\nconvective velocity, and the overshooting layer. These quantities are selected\nfor their relevance to one-dimensional stellar evolution calculations, so that\nour results are focused toward the 321D link. The inclusion in the spherical\nshell of the boundary between the radiative and convection zones decreases the\namplitude of convective velocities in the convection zone. The inclusion of\nnear-surface layers in the spherical shell can increase the amplitude of\nconvective velocities, although the radial structure of the velocity profile\nestablished by deep convection is unchanged. The impact from including the\nnear-surface layers depends on the speed and structure of small-scale\nconvection in the near-surface layers. Larger convective velocities in the\nconvection zone result in a commensurate increase in the overshooting layer\nwidth and decrease in the convective turnover time. These results provide\nsupport for non-local aspects of convection.\n", "  Dust growth via accretion of gas species has been proposed as the dominant\nprocess to increase the amount of dust in galaxies. We show here that this\nhypothesis encounters severe difficulties that make it unfit to explain the\nobserved UV and IR properties of such systems, particularly at high redshifts.\nDust growth in the diffuse ISM phases is hampered by (a) too slow accretion\nrates; (b) too high dust temperatures, and (c) the Coulomb barrier that\neffectively blocks accretion. In molecular clouds these problems are largely\nalleviated. Grains are cold (but not colder than the CMB temperature, (Tcmb =\n20 K at redshift z=6). However, in dense environments accreted materials form\nicy water mantles, perhaps with impurities. Mantles are immediately\nphoto-desorbed as grains return to the diffuse ISM at the end of the cloud\nlifetime, thus erasing any memory of the growth. We conclude that dust\nattenuating stellar light at high-$z$ must be ready-made stardust largely\nproduced in supernova ejecta.\n", "  We present new high-quality ALMA observations of the Red Rectangle (a well\nknown post-AGB object) in C17O J=6-5 and H13CN J=4-3 line emission and results\nfrom a new reduction of already published 13CO J=3-2 data. A detailed model\nfitting of all the molecular line data, including previous maps and single-dish\nspectra, was performed using a sophisticated code. These observations and the\ncorresponding modeling allowed us to deepen the analysis of the nebular\nproperties. We also stress the uncertainties in the model fitting.\n  We confirm the presence of a rotating equatorial disk and an outflow, which\nis mainly formed of gas leaving the disk. The mass of the disk is ~ 0.01 Mo,\nand that of the CO-rich outflow is ~ 10 times smaller. High temperatures of ~\n100 K are derived for most components. From comparison of the mass values, we\nroughly estimate the lifetime of the rotating disk, which is found to be of\nabout 10000 yr. Taking data of a few other post-AGB composite nebulae into\naccount, we find that the lifetimes of disks around post-AGB stars typically\nrange between 5000 and more than 20000 yr. The angular momentum of the disk is\nfound to be high, ~ 9 Mo AU km/s, which is comparable to that of the stellar\nsystem at present. Our observations of H13CN show a particularly wide velocity\ndispersion and indicate that this molecule is only abundant in the inner\nKeplerian disk, at ~ 60 AU from the stellar system. We suggest that HCN is\nformed in a dense photodissociation region (PDR) due to the UV excess known to\nbe produced by the stellar system, following chemical mechanisms that are well\nestablished for interstellar medium PDRs and disks orbiting young stars. We\nfurther suggest that this UV excess could lead to the efficient formation and\nexcitation of PAHs and other C-bearing macromolecules, whose emission is very\nintense in the optical counterpart.\n", "  We consider decaying dark matter with masses $10^{7} \\lesssim M \\lesssim\n10^{16}$ GeV, as a source of ultra-high energy (UHE) gamma rays. Using recent\nlimits on UHE gamma-ray flux for energies $E_\\gamma > 2 \\cdot 10^{14}$ eV,\nprovided by extensive air shower observatories, we put limits on masses and\nlifetimes of the dark matter. We also discuss possible dark matter decay origin\nof tentative 100 PeV photon flux detected with EAS-MSU experiment.\n", "  Context. Fast rotating red giants in the upper part of the red giant branch\nhave surface velocities that cannot be explained by single star evolution.\n  Aims. We check whether tides between a star and a planet followed by planet\nengulfment can indeed accelerate the surface rotation of red giants for a\nsufficient long time in order to produce these fast rotating red giants.\n  Methods. Using rotating stellar models, accounting for the redistribution of\nthe angular momentum inside the star by different transport mechanisms, for the\nexchanges of angular momentum between the planet orbit and the star before the\nengulfment and for the deposition of angular momentum inside the star at the\nengulfment, we study how the surface rotation velocity at the stellar surface\nevolves.\n  Results. We show that the surface velocities reached at the end of the\norbital decay due to tidal forces and planet engulfment can be similar to\nvalues observed for fast rotating red giants. This surface velocity then\ndecreases when the star evolves along the red giant branch but at a\nsufficiently slow pace for allowing stars to be detected with such a high\nvelocity. More quantitatively, star-planet interaction can produce a rapid\nacceleration of the surface of the star, above values equal to 8 km s$^{-1}$,\nfor periods lasting up to more than 30% the red giant branch phase. The changes\nof the surface carbon isotopic ratios produced by the dilution of the planetary\nmaterial into the convective envelope is quite modest. Much more important\nmight be the increase of the lithium abundance due to this effect. However\nlithium may be affected by many different, still uncertain, processes.\n  Conclusions. The acceleration of the stellar surface to rotation velocities\nabove limits that depend on the surface gravity does appear at the moment as\nthe clearest signature of a star-planet interaction.[abridged]\n", "  In this article, we propose a novel approach to measure the branching ratios\nof the leptonic eta(')-> mu+mu- decays by using charmed meson decays, namely,\nD+(s)->pi+ eta(')(->mu+mu-) and D0->K-pi+eta(')(->mu+mu-). We advocate that the\ndata available at LHCb can already yield a new measurement of Br(eta->mu+mu-)\nwith accuracy competitive with the current world average. We also estimate that\nusing the data collected by LHCb between 2015 and 2018 in proton-proton\ncollisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, corresponding to an integrated\nluminosity of 5.0/fb, the relative uncertainties to this branching ratio can be\nreduced down to ~10%. We also show that the first observation of\nBr(eta'->mu+mu-) may be possible with the Upgrade of the LHCb experiment.\n", "  We point out that if the baryon number violating neutron-antineutron\noscillation is discovered, it would impose strong limits on the departure from\nEinstein's equivalence principle at a level of one part in $10^{19}$. If this\ndeparture owes its origin to the existence of long-range forces coupled to\nbaryon number $B$ (or $B-L$), it would imply very stringent constraints on the\nstrength of gauge bosons coupling to baryon number current. For instance, if\nthe force mediating baryon number has strength $\\alpha_B$ and its range is\nlarger than a megaparsec, we find the limit to be $\\alpha_B \\leq 2\\times\n10^{-57}$, which is much stronger than all other existing bounds. For smaller\nrange for the force, we get slightly weaker, but still stringent bounds by\nconsidering the potential of the Earth and the Sun.\n", "  We demonstrate a two-qubit logic gate driven by near-field microwaves in a\nroom-temperature microfabricated ion trap. We measure a gate fidelity of\n99.7(1)\\%, which is above the minimum threshold required for fault-tolerant\nquantum computing. The gate is applied directly to $^{43}$Ca$^+$ \"atomic clock\"\nqubits (coherence time $T_2^*\\approx 50\\,\\mathrm{s}$) using the microwave\nmagnetic field gradient produced by a trap electrode. We introduce a\ndynamically-decoupled gate method, which stabilizes the qubits against\nfluctuating a.c.\\ Zeeman shifts and avoids the need to null the microwave\nfield.\n", "  [Abridged] The aim of this work is to search for an absorption signal from\nexospheric sodium (Na) and singly ionized calcium (Ca$^+$) in the optical\ntransmission spectrum of the hot rocky super-Earth 55 Cancri e. Although the\ncurrent best-fitting models to the planet mass and radius require a possible\natmospheric component, uncertainties in the radius exist, making it possible\nthat 55 Cancri e could be a hot rocky planet without an atmosphere. High\nresolution (R$\\sim$110000) time-series spectra of five transits of 55 Cancri e,\nobtained with three different telescopes (UVES/VLT, HARPS/ESO 3.6m &\nHARPS-N/TNG) were analysed. Targeting the sodium D lines and the calcium H and\nK lines, the potential planet exospheric signal was filtered out from the much\nstronger stellar and telluric signals, making use of the change of the radial\ncomponent of the orbital velocity of the planet over the transit from -57 to\n+57 km/sec. Combining all five transit data sets, we detect a signal\npotentially associated with sodium in the planet exosphere at a statistical\nsignificance level of 3$\\sigma$. Combining the four HARPS transits that cover\nthe calcium H and K lines, we also find a potential signal from ionized calcium\n(4.1 $\\sigma$). Interestingly, this latter signal originates from just one of\nthe transit measurements - with a 4.9$\\sigma$ detection at this epoch.\nUnfortunately, due to the low significance of the measured sodium signal and\nthe potentially variable Ca$^+$ signal, we estimate the p-values of these\nsignals to be too high (corresponding to <4$\\sigma$) to claim unambiguous\nexospheric detections. By comparing the observed signals with artificial\nsignals injected early in the analysis, the absorption by Na and Ca$^+$ are\nestimated to be at a level of approximately 2.3$\\times 10^{-3}$ and 7.0$\\times\n10^{-2}$ respectively, relative to the stellar spectrum.\n", "  We study the model of Fe-based superconductors with intraorbital attraction,\ndesigned to favor a spontaneous orbital polarization. Previous studies of this\nmodel within the two-orbital approximation indicated that the leading\ninstability is toward s-wave superconductivity and the subleading one is toward\nanti-ferro-orbital order, which breaks the translational symmetry of the\ncrystal. The two-orbital approximation is, however, not consistent with the\nFermi surface geometry of Fe superconductors, as it yields the wrong position\nof one of the hole pockets. Here we analyze the model with the same interaction\nbut with realistic Fermi surface geometry (two hole pockets at the center of\nthe Brillouin zone and two electron pockets at its boundary). We apply the\nparquet renormalization-group (pRG) technique to detect the leading instability\nupon the lowering of the temperature. We argue that the pRG analysis strongly\nfavors a q = 0 orbital order, which in the band basis is a d-wave Pomeranchuk\norder.\n", "  We present the results of CCD $UBV$ photometric and spectroscopic\nobservations of the open cluster NGC 225. In order to determine the structural\nparameters of NGC 225, we calculated the stellar density profile in the\ncluster's field. We estimated the probabilities of the stars being physical\nmembers of the cluster using the existing astrometric data. The most likely\nmembers of the cluster were used in the determination of the astrophysical\nparameters of the cluster. We calculated the mean radial velocity of the\ncluster as $V_{r}=-8.3\\pm 5.0$ km s$^{-1}$ from the optical spectra of eight\nstars in the cluster's field. Using the U-B vs B-V two-colour diagram and UV\nexcesses of the F-G type main-sequence stars, the reddening and metallicity of\nNGC 225 were inferred as $E(B-V)=0.151\\pm 0.047$ mag and $[Fe/H]=-0.11\\pm 0.01$\ndex, respectively. We fitted the colour-magnitude diagrams of NGC 225 with the\nPARSEC isochrones and derived the distance modulus, distance and age of the\ncluster as $\\mu_{V}=9.3\\pm 0.07$ mag, d=585$\\pm$20 pc and $t=900\\pm 100$ Myr,\nrespectively. We also estimated the galactic orbital parameters and space\nvelocity components of the cluster and found that the cluster has a slightly\neccentric orbit of $e=0.07\\pm 0.01$ and an orbital period of $P_{orb}= 255\\pm\n5$ Myr.\n", "  We present results for time-dependent electron transport in a ballistic\ngraphene field-effect transistor with an ac-driven gate. Nonlinear response to\nthe ac drive is derived utilizing Floquet theory for scattering states in\ncombination with Landauer-B\\\"uttiker theory for transport. We identify two\nregimes that can be useful for applications: (i) low and (ii) high doping of\ngraphene under source and drain contacts, relative to the doping level in the\ngraphene channel, which in an experiment can be varied by a back gate. In both\nregimes, inelastic scattering induced by the ac drive can excite quasi-bound\nstates in the channel that leads to resonance promotion of higher order\nsidebands. Already for weak to intermediate ac drive strength, this leads to a\nsubstantial change in the direct current between source and drain. For strong\nac drive with frequency $\\Omega$, we compute the higher harmonics of\nfrequencies $n\\Omega$ ($n$ integer) in the source-drain conductance. In regime\n(ii), we show that particular harmonics (for instance $n=6$) can be selectively\nenhanced by tuning the doping level in the channel or by tuning the drive\nstrength. We propose that the device operated in the weak-drive regime can be\nused to detect THz radiation, while in the strong-drive regime it can be used\nas a frequency multiplier.\n", "  Supergiant fast X-ray transients (SFXTs) are high mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs)\nhosting a neutron star and an OB supergiant companion. We examine the available\nSwift data, as well as other new or archival/serendipitous data, on three\nsources: IGR J17407-2808, 2XMM J185114.3-000004, and IGR J18175-2419, whose\nX-ray characteristics qualify them as candidate SFXT, in order to explore their\nproperties and test whether they are consistent with an SFXT nature. As IGR\nJ17407-2808 and 2XMM J185114.3-000004 triggered the Burst Alert Telescope on\nboard Swift, the Swift data allow us to provide their first arcsecond\nlocalisations, leading to an unequivocal identification of the source CXOU\nJ174042.0-280724 as the soft X-ray counterpart of IGR J17407-2808, as well as\ntheir first broadband spectra, which can be fit with models generally\ndescribing accreting neutron stars in HMXBs. While still lacking optical\nspectroscopy to assess the spectral type of the companion, we propose 2XMM\nJ185114.3-000004 as a very strong SFXT candidate. The nature of IGR J17407-2808\nremains, instead, more uncertain. Its broad band properties cannot exclude that\nthe emission originates from either a HMXB (and in that case, a SFXT) or, more\nlikely, a low mass X-ray binary. Finally, based on the deep non-detection in\nour XRT monitoring campaign and a careful reanalysis of the original Integral\ndata in which the discovery of the source was first reported, we show that IGR\nJ18175-2419 is likely a spurious detection.\n", "  We report the discovery of an extrasolar planet detected from the combined\ndata of a microlensing event OGLE-2015-BLG-0051/KMT-2015-BLG-0048 acquired by\ntwo microlensing surveys. Despite that the short planetary signal occurred in\nthe very early Bulge season during which the lensing event could be seen for\njust about an hour, the signal was continuously and densely covered. From the\nBayesian analysis using models of the mass function, matter and velocity\ndistributions combined with the information of the angular Einstein radius, it\nis found that the host of the planet is located in the Galactic bulge. The\nplanet has a mass $0.72_{-0.07}^{+0.65}\\ M_{\\rm J}$ and it is orbiting a\nlow-mass M-dwarf host with a projected separation $d_\\perp=0.73 \\pm 0.08$ AU.\nThe discovery of the planet demonstrates the capability of the current\nhigh-cadence microlensing lensing surveys in detecting and characterizing\nplanets.\n", "  AGN feedback is invoked as one of the most relevant mechanisms that shape the\nevolution of galaxies. Our goal is to understand the interplay between AGN\nfeedback and the interstellar medium in M51, a nearby spiral galaxy with a\nmodest AGN and a kpc-scale radio jet expanding through the disc of the galaxy.\nFor that purpose, we combine molecular gas observations in the CO(1-0) and\nHCN(1-0) lines from the Plateau de Bure interferometer with archival radio,\nX-ray, and optical data. We show that there is a significant scarcity of CO\nemission in the ionisation cone, while molecular gas emission tends to\naccumulate towards the edges of the cone. The distribution and kinematics of CO\nand HCN line emission reveal AGN feedback effects out to r~500pc, covering the\nwhole extent of the radio jet, with complex kinematics in the molecular gas\nwhich displays strong local variations. We propose that this is the result of\nthe almost coplanar jet pushing on molecular gas in different directions as it\nexpands; the effects are more pronounced in HCN than in CO emission, probably\nas the result of radiative shocks. Following previous interpretation of the\nredshifted molecular line in the central 5\" as caused by a molecular outflow,\nwe estimate the outflow rates to be Mdot_H2~0.9Msun/yr and\nMdot_dense~0.6Msun/yr, which are comparable to the molecular inflow rates\n(~1Msun/yr); gas inflow and AGN feedback could be mutually regulated processes.\nThe agreement with findings in other nearby radio galaxies suggests that this\nis not an isolated case, and probably the paradigm of AGN feedback through\nradio jets, at least for galaxies hosting low-luminosity active nuclei.\n", "  The Sinai model of a tracer diffusing in a quenched Brownian potential is a\nmuch studied problem exhibiting a logarithmically slow anomalous diffusion due\nto the growth of energy barriers with the system size. However, if the\npotential is random but periodic, the regime of anomalous diffusion crosses\nover to one of normal diffusion once a tracer has diffused over a few periods\nof the system. Here we consider a system in which the potential is given by a\nBrownian Bridge on a finite interval $(0,L)$ and then periodically repeated\nover the whole real line, and study the power spectrum $S(f)$ of the diffusive\nprocess $x(t)$ in such a potential. We show that for most of realizations of\n$x(t)$ in a given realization of the potential, the low-frequency behavior is\n$S(f) \\sim {\\cal A}/f^2$, i.e., the same as for standard Brownian motion, and\nthe amplitude ${\\cal A}$ is a disorder-dependent random variable with a finite\nsupport. Focusing on the statistical properties of this random variable, we\ndetermine the moments of ${\\cal A}$ of arbitrary, negative or positive order\n$k$, and demonstrate that they exhibit a multi-fractal dependence on $k$, and a\nrather unusual dependence on the temperature and on the periodicity $L$, which\nare supported by atypical realizations of the periodic disorder. We finally\nshow that the distribution of ${\\cal A}$ has a log-normal left tail, and\nexhibits an essential singularity close to the right edge of the support, which\nis related to the Lifshitz singularity. Our findings are based both on analytic\nresults and on extensive numerical simulations of the process $x(t)$.\n", "  We aim to improve our knowledge on the structure and dynamics of the\ncircumstellar disk of the LMC B[e] supergiant LHA 120-S 73. High-resolution\noptical and near-IR spectroscopic data were obtained over a period of 16 and 7\nyears, respectively. The spectra cover the diagnostic emission lines from\n[CaII] and [OI], as well as the CO bands. These features trace the disk at\ndifferent distances from the star. We analyzed the kinematics of the individual\nemission regions by modeling their emission profiles. A low-resolution\nmid-infrared spectrum was obtained as well, which provides information on the\ncomposition of the dusty disk. All diagnostic emission features display\ndouble-peaked line profiles, which we interpret as due to Keplerian rotation.\nWe find that LHA 120-S 73 is surrounded by at least four individual rings of\nmaterial with alternating densities (or by a disk with strongly non-monotonic\nradial density distribution). Moreover, we find that the molecular ring must\nhave gaps or at least strong density inhomogeneities, or in other words, a\nclumpy structure. The mid-infrared spectrum displays features of oxygen- and\ncarbon-rich grain species, which indicates a long-lived, stable dusty disk. We\ncannot confirm the previously reported high value for the stellar rotation\nvelocity. The line profile of HeI 5876 A is strongly variable in both width and\nshape and resembles of those seen in non-radially pulsating stars. A proper\ndetermination of the real underlying stellar rotation velocity is hence not\npossible. The existence of multiple stable and clumpy rings of alternating\ndensity recalls ring structures around planets. Although there is currently\ninsufficient observational evidence, it is tempting to propose a scenario with\none (or more) minor bodies or planets revolving around LHA 120-S 73 and\nstabilizing the ring system, in analogy to the shepherd moons in planetary\nsystems.\n", "  We present upper limits in the hard X-ray and gamma-ray bands at the time of\nthe LIGO gravitational-wave event GW 151226 derived from the CALorimetric\nElectron Telescope (CALET) observation. The main instrument of CALET,\nCALorimeter (CAL), observes gamma-rays from ~1 GeV up to 10 TeV with a field of\nview of ~2 sr. The CALET gamma-ray burst monitor (CGBM) views ~3 sr and ~2pi sr\nof the sky in the 7 keV - 1 MeV and the 40 keV - 20 MeV bands, respectively, by\nusing two different scintillator-based instruments. The CGBM covered 32.5% and\n49.1% of the GW 151226 sky localization probability in the 7 keV - 1 MeV and 40\nkeV - 20 MeV bands respectively. We place a 90% upper limit of 2 x 10^{-7} erg\ncm-2 s-1 in the 1 - 100 GeV band where CAL reaches 15% of the integrated LIGO\nprobability (~1.1 sr). The CGBM 7 sigma upper limits are 1.0 x 10^{-6} erg cm-2\ns-1 (7-500 keV) and 1.8 x 10^{-6} erg cm-2 s-1 (50-1000 keV) for one second\nexposure. Those upper limits correspond to the luminosity of 3-5 x 10^{49} erg\ns-1 which is significantly lower than typical short GRBs.\n", "  Using high-resolution transition region (TR) observations taken by the\nInterface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) mission, Tian et al. (2014b)\nrevealed numerous short-lived subarcsecond bright dots (BDs) above sunspots\n(mostly located in the penumbrae), which indicate yet unexplained small-scale\nenergy releases. Moreover, whether these subarcsecond TR brightenings have any\nsignature in the lower atmosphere and how they are formed are still not fully\nresolved. This paper presents a multi-wavelength study of the TR penumbral BDs\nusing a coordinated observation of a near disk-center sunspot with IRIS and the\n1.6 m New Solar Telescope (NST) at the Big Bear Solar Observatory. NST provides\nhigh-resolution chromospheric and photospheric observations with narrow-band\nH-alpha imaging spectroscopy and broad-band TiO images, respectively,\ncomplementary to IRIS TR observations. A total of 2692 TR penumbral BDs are\nidentified from a 37-minute time series of IRIS 1400 A slitjaw images. Their\nlocations tend to be associated more with downflowing and darker fibrils in the\nchromosphere, and weakly associated with bright penumbral features in the\nphotosphere. However, temporal evolution analyses of the BDs show that there is\nno consistent and convincing brightening response in the chromosphere. These\nresults are compatible with a formation mechanism of the TR penumbral BDs by\nfalling plasma from coronal heights along more vertical and dense magnetic\nloops. The BDs may also be produced by small-scale impulsive magnetic\nreconnection taking place sufficiently high in the atmosphere that has no\nenergy release in the chromosphere.\n", "  Until recently it was thought that high Galactic latitude clouds were a\nnon-star-forming ensemble. However, in a previous study we reported the\ndiscovery of two embedded clusters (ECs) far away from the Galactic plane\n($\\sim5$ kpc). In our recent star cluster catalogue we provided additional high\nand intermediate latitude cluster candidates. This work aims to clarify if our\nprevious detection of star clusters far away from the disc represents just an\nepisodic event or if the star cluster formation is currently a systematic\nphenomenon in the Galactic halo. We analyse the nature of four clusters found\nin our recent catalogue and report the discovery of three new ECs with\nunusually high latitude and distance from the Galactic disc midplane. All of\nthese clusters are younger than 5 Myr. The high-latitude ECs C 932, C 934, and\nC 939 appear to be related to a cloud complex about 5 kpc below the Galactic\ndisc, under the Local arm. The other clusters are above the disc, C 1074 and C\n1100 with a vertical distance of $\\sim3$ kpc, C 1099 with $\\sim2$ kpc, and C\n1101 with $\\sim1.8$ kpc. According to the derived parameters there occur ECs\nlocated below and above the disc, which is an evidence of widespread star\ncluster formation throughout the Galactic halo. Thus, this study represents a\nparadigm shift, in the sense that a sterile halo becomes now a host of ongoing\nstar formation. The origin and fate of these ECs remain open. There are two\npossibilities for their origin, Galactic fountain or infall. The discovery of\nECs far from the disc suggests that the Galactic halo is more actively forming\nstars than previously thought and since most ECs do not survive the\n\\textit{infant mortality} it may be raining stars from the halo into the disc,\nand/or the halo harbours generations of stars formed in clusters like those\nhereby detected.\n", "  Properties of magnetic field in the internetwork regions are still fairly\nunknown due to rather weak spectropolarimetric signals. We address the matter\nby using the 2D inversion code that is able to retrieve the information on\nsmallest spatial scales, up to the diffraction limit, while being less\nsusceptible to noise than most of the previous methods used. Performance of the\ncode and the impact of the various effects on the retrieved field distribution\nis tested first on the realistic MHD simulations. The best inversion scenario\nis then applied to the real Hinode/SP data. Tests on simulations show: (1) the\nbest choice of node position ensures a decent retrieval of all parameters, (2)\ncode performs well for different configurations of magnetic field, (3) slightly\ndifferent noise level or slightly different defocus included in the spatial PSF\nproduces no significant effect on the results and (4) temporal integration\nshifts the field distribution to the stronger, more horizontally inclined\nfield. Although the contribution of the weak field is slightly overestimated\ndue to noise, the 2D inversions are able to recover well the overall\ndistribution of the magnetic field strength. Application of the 2D inversion\ncode on the Hinode/SP internetwork observations reveals a monotonic field\nstrength distribution. The mean field strength at optical depth unity is $\\sim\n130$~G. At the higher layers, field strength drops as the field becomes more\nhorizontal. Regarding the distribution of the field inclination, tests show\nthat we cannot directly retrieve it with the observations/tools at hand,\nhowever the obtained distributions are consistent with those expected from\nsimulations with a quasi-isotropic field inclination after accounting for\nobservational effects.\n", "  CONTEXT. Gamma Doradus stars (hereafter gamma Dor stars) are known to exhibit\ngravity- and/or gravito-intertial modes that probe the inner stellar region\nnear the convective core boundary. The non-equidistant spacing of the pulsation\nperiods is an observational signature of the stars' evolution and current\ninternal structure and is heavily influenced by rotation.\n  AIMS. We aim to constrain the near-core rotation rates for a sample of gamma\nDor stars, for which we have detected period spacing patterns.\n  METHODS. We combined the asymptotic period spacing with the traditional\napproximation of stellar pulsation to fit the observed period spacing patterns\nusing chi-squared optimisation. The method was applied to the observed period\nspacing patterns of a sample of stars and used for ensemble modelling.\n  RESULTS. For the majority of stars with an observed period spacing pattern we\nsuccessfully determined the rotation rates and the asymptotic period spacing\nvalues, though the uncertainty margins on the latter were typically large. This\nalso resulted directly in the identification of the modes corresponding with\nthe detected pulsation frequencies, which for most stars were prograde dipole\ngravity and gravito-inertial modes. The majority of the observed retrograde\nmodes were found to be Rossby modes. We further discuss the limitations of the\nmethod due to the neglect of the centrifugal force and the incomplete treatment\nof the Coriolis force.\n  CONCLUSION. Despite its current limitations, the proposed methodology was\nsuccessful to derive the rotation rates and to identify the modes from the\nobserved period spacing patterns. It forms the first step towards detailed\nseismic modelling based on observed period spacing patterns of moderately to\nrapidly rotating gamma Dor stars.\n", "  Long gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs) and superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) are both\nexplosive transients with very massive progenitor stars. Clues about the nature\nof the progenitors can be found by investigating environments in which such\ntransients occur. While studies of LGRB host galaxies have a long history,\ndedicated observational campaigns have only recently resulted in a high enough\nnumber of photometrically and spectroscopically observed SLSN hosts to allow\nstatistically significant analysis of their properties. In this paper we make a\ncomparison of the host galaxies of hydrogen-poor (H-poor) SLSNe and the\nSwift/BAT6 sample of LGRBs. In contrast to previous studies we use a complete\nsample of LGRBs and we address a special attention to the comparison\nmethodology and the selection of SLSN sample whose data have been compiled from\nthe available literature. At intermediate redshifts (0.3 < z < 0.7) the two\nclasses of transients select galaxies whose properties (stellar mass,\nluminosity, star-formation rate, specific star-formation rate and metallicity)\ndo not differ on average significantly. Moreover, the host galaxies of both\nclasses of objects follow the fundamental metallicity relation and the\nfundamental plane of metallicity. In contrast to previous studies we show that\nat intermediate redshifts the emission line equivalent widths of the two\npopulations are essentially the same and that the previous claims regarding the\nhigher fraction of SLSN hosts among the extreme emission line galaxies with\nrespect to LGRBs are mostly due to a larger fraction of strong-line emitters\namong SLSN hosts at z < 0.3, where samples of LGRB hosts are small and poorly\ndefined.\n", "  We find that if solid xenon is formed from liquid xenon, denoted \"ice\", there\nis a 10% increase of $^{129}$Xe longitudinal relaxation $T_1$ time (taken at 77\nK and 2 Tesla) over a trickle-freeze formation, denoted \"snow\". Forming xenon\nice also gives unprecedented reproducibility of $^{129}$Xe $T_1$ measurements\nacross a range of 77-150 K. This temperature dependence roughly follows the\ntheory of spin-rotation mediated by Raman scattering of harmonic phonons\n(SRRS), though it results in a smaller-than-predicted spin-rotation coupling\nstrength $c_{K0}/h$. Enriched ice $^{129}$Xe $T_1$ experiments show no isotopic\ndependence in bulk relaxation mechanisms at 77 K and at kilogauss fields.\n", "  The unprecedented extent of coverage provided by Kepler observations recently\nrevealed outbursts in two hydrogen-atmosphere pulsating white dwarfs (DAVs)\nthat cause hours-long increases in the overall mean flux of up to 14%. We have\nidentified two new outbursting pulsating white dwarfs in K2, bringing the total\nnumber of known outbursting white dwarfs to four. EPIC 211629697, with T_eff =\n10,780 +/- 140 K and log(g) = 7.94 +/- 0.08, shows outbursts recurring on\naverage every 5.0 d, increasing the overall flux by up to 15%. EPIC 229227292,\nwith T_eff = 11,190 +/- 170 K and log(g) = 8.02 +/- 0.05, has outbursts that\nrecur roughly every 2.4 d with amplitudes up to 9%. We establish that only the\ncoolest pulsating white dwarfs within a small temperature range near the cool,\nred edge of the DAV instability strip exhibit these outbursts.\n", "  We study the polarization properties of the jitter and synchrotron radiation\nproduced by electrons in highly turbulent anisotropic magnetic fields. The net\npolarization is provided by the geometry of the magnetic field the directions\nof which are parallel to a certain plane. Such conditions may appear in the\nrelativistic shocks during the amplification of the magnetic field through the\nso-called Weibel instability. While the polarization properties of the jitter\nradiation allows extraction of direct information on the turbulence spectrum as\nwell as the geometry of magnetic field, the polarization of the synchrotron\nradiation reflects the distribution of the magnetic field over its strength.\nFor the isotropic distribution of monoenergetic electrons, we found that the\ndegree of polarization of the synchrotron radiation is larger than the\npolarization of the jitter radiation. For the power-law energy distribution of\nelectrons the relation between the degree of polarization of synchrotron and\njitter radiation depends on the spectral index of the distribution.\n", "  Using the concept of variational tricomplex endowed with a presymplectic\nstructure, we formulate the general notion of symmetry. We show that each\ngeneralized symmetry of a gauge system gives rise to a sequence of conservation\nlaws that are represented by on-shell closed forms of various degrees. This\nextends the usual Noether's correspondence between global symmetries and\nconservation laws to the case of lower-degree conservation laws and not\nnecessarily variational equations of motion. Finally, we equip the space of\nconservation laws of a given degree with a Lie bracket and establish a\nhomomorphism of the resulting Lie algebra to the Lie algebra of global\nsymmetries.\n", "  High-order harmonic generation by a bicircular field, which consists of two\ncoplanar counter-rotating circularly polarized fields of frequency $r\\omega$\nand $s\\omega$ ($r$ and $s$ are integers), is investigated for a polyatomic\nmolecule. This field possesses dynamical symmetry, which can be adjusted to the\nsymmetry of the molecular Hamiltonian and used to investigate the molecular\nsymmetry. For polyatomic molecules having the $C_{r+s}$ symmetry only the\nharmonics $n=q(r+s)\\pm r$, $q=1,2,\\ldots$, are emitted having the ellipticity\n$\\varepsilon_n=\\pm 1$. We illustrate this using the example of the planar\nmolecules BH$_3$ and BF$_3$, which obey the $C_3$ symmetry. We show that for\nthe BF$_3$ molecule, similarly to atoms with a $p$ ground state, there is a\nstrong asymmetry in the emission of high harmonics with opposite helicities.\nThis asymmetry depends on the molecular orientation.\n", "  We consider periodic single-photon sources with combined multiplexing in\nwhich the outputs of several time-multiplexed sources are spatially\nmultiplexed. We give a full statistical description of such systems in order to\noptimize them with respect to maximal single-photon probability. We carry out\nthe optimization for a particular scenario which can be realized in bulk optics\nand its expected performance is potentially the best at the present state of\nthe art. We find that combined multiplexing outperforms purely spatially or\ntime multiplexed sources for certain parameters only, and we characterize these\ncases. Combined multiplexing can have the advantages of possibly using less\nnonlinear sources, achieving higher repetition rates, and the potential\napplicability for continuous pumping. We estimate an achievable single-photon\nprobability between 85% and 89%.\n", "  Aims. Galaxy mass models based on simple and analytical functions for the\ndensity and potential pairs have been widely proposed in the literature. Disk\nmodels constrained by kinematic data alone give information on the global disk\nstructure only very near the Galactic plane. We attempt to circumvent this\nissue by constructing disk mass models whose three-dimensional structures are\nconstrained by a recent Galactic star counts model in the near-infrared and\nalso by observations of the hydrogen distribution in the disk. Our main aim is\nto provide models for the gravitational potential of the Galaxy that are fully\nanalytical but also with a more realistic description of the density\ndistribution in the disk component. Methods. From the disk model directly based\non the observations (here divided into the thin and thick stellar disks and the\nHI and H$_2$ disks subcomponents), we produce fitted mass models by combining\nthree Miyamoto-Nagai disk profiles of any \"model order\" (1, 2, or 3) for each\ndisk subcomponent. The Miyamoto-Nagai disks are combined with models for the\nbulge and \"dark halo\" components and the total set of parameters is adjusted by\nobservational kinematic constraints. A model which includes a ring density\nstructure in the disk, beyond the solar Galactic radius, is also investigated.\nResults. The Galactic mass models return very good matches to the imposed\nobservational constraints. In particular, the model with the ring density\nstructure provides a greater contribution of the disk to the rotational support\ninside the solar circle. The gravitational potential models and their\nassociated force-fields are described in analytically closed forms, and in\naddition, they are also compatible with our best knowledge of the stellar and\ngas distributions in the disk component. The gravitational potential models are\nsuited for investigations of orbits in the Galactic disk.\n", "  Infrared-faint radio sources (IFRS) are a class of radio-loud (RL) active\ngalactic nuclei (AGN) at high redshifts (z > 1.7) that are characterised by\ntheir relative infrared faintness, resulting in enormous radio-to-infrared flux\ndensity ratios of up to several thousand. We aim to test the hypothesis that\nIFRS are young AGN, particularly GHz peaked-spectrum (GPS) and compact\nsteep-spectrum (CSS) sources that have a low frequency turnover. We use the\nrich radio data set available for the Australia Telescope Large Area Survey\nfields, covering the frequency range between 150 MHz and 34 GHz with up to 19\nwavebands from different telescopes, and build radio spectral energy\ndistributions (SEDs) for 34 IFRS. We then study the radio properties of this\nclass of object with respect to turnover, spectral index, and behaviour towards\nhigher frequencies. We also present the highest-frequency radio observations of\nan IFRS, observed with the Plateau de Bure Interferometer at 105 GHz, and model\nthe multi-wavelength and radio-far-infrared SED of this source. We find IFRS\nusually follow single power laws down to observed frequencies of around 150\nMHz. Mostly, the radio SEDs are steep, but we also find ultra-steep SEDs. In\nparticular, IFRS show statistically significantly steeper radio SEDs than the\nbroader RL AGN population. Our analysis reveals that the fractions of GPS and\nCSS sources in the population of IFRS are consistent with the fractions in the\nbroader RL AGN population. We find that at least 18% of IFRS contain young AGN,\nalthough the fraction might be significantly higher as suggested by the steep\nSEDs and the compact morphology of IFRS. The detailed multi-wavelength SED\nmodelling of one IFRS shows that it is different from ordinary AGN, although it\nis consistent with a composite starburst-AGN model with a star formation rate\nof 170 solar masses per year.\n", "  The AGILE satellite discovered the transient source AGL J2241+4454 in 2010\nwhich triggered the study of the associated field allowing for the discovery of\nthe first Be/black hole binary system: MWC 656. This binary was suggested to be\nthe counterpart of AGL J2241+4454, but this is still not a firm association. In\nthis work we explore the archival AGILE and Fermi/LAT data in order to find\nmore transient events originating in the field of AGL J2241+4454 and address\nthe possibility to link them to the accretion/ejection processes of MWC 656. We\nfound a total of 9 other transient events with AGILE compatible with the\nposition of AGL J2241+4454, besides the one from 2010. We folded this events\nwith the period of the binary system and we did not find significant results\nthat allow us to associate the gamma-ray activity to any particular orbital\nphase. By stacking the 10 transient events we obtained a spectrum that extends\nbetween 100 MeV and 1 GeV, and we fitted it with a power law with photon index\n{\\Gamma} = 2.3 +/- 0.2. We searched into the Fermi /LAT data in order to\ncomplement the gamma-ray information provided by AGILE but no significant\nresults arose. In order to investigate this apparent contradiction between the\ntwo gamma-ray telescopes, we studied the exposure of the field of AGL\nJ2241+4454 in both instruments finding significant differences. In particular,\nAGILE exposed for longer time and at lower off-axis angle distance the field of\nAGL J2241+4454. This fact, together with the energy dependent sensitivity of\nboth instruments, and the soft spectrum found in the stacking analysis, might\nexplain why AGILE observed the transient events not seen by Fermi/LAT.\n", "  Motivated by holographic models of (pseudo)conformal Universe, we carry out\ncomplete analysis of linearized metric perturbations in the time-dependent\ntwo-brane setup of the Lykken-Randall type. We present the equations of motion\nfor the scalar, vector and tensor perturbations and identify light modes in the\nspectrum, which are scalar radion and transverse-traceless graviton. We show\nthat there are no other modes in the discrete part of the spectrum. We pay\nspecial attention to properties of light modes and show, in particular, that\nthe radion has red power spectrum at late times, as anticipated on holographic\ngrounds. Unlike the graviton, the radion survives in the single-brane limit,\nwhen one of the branes is sent to the adS boundary. These properties imply that\npotentially observable features characteristic of the 4d (pseudo)conformal\ncosmology, such as statistical anisotropy and specific shapes of\nnon-Gaussianity, are inherent also in holographic conformal models as well as\nin brane world inflation.\n", "  The accretion mechanism producing the short flares observed from the\nSupergiant Fast X-ray Transients (SFXT) is still highly debated and forms a\nmajor part in our attempts to place these X-ray binaries in the wider context\nof the High Mass X-ray Binaries.\n  We report on a 216 ks INTEGRAL observation of the SFXT IGR J16328-4726\n(August 24-27, 2014) simultaneous with two fixed-time observations with XMM\nNewton (33ks and 20ks) performed around the putative periastron passage, in\norder to investigate the accretion regime and the wind properties during this\norbital phase. During these observations, the source has shown luminosity\nvariations, from 4x10^{34} erg/s to 10^{36} erg/s, linked to spectral\nproperties changes. The soft X-ray continuum is well modeled by a power law\nwith a photon index varying from 1.2 up to 1.7 and with high values of the\ncolumn density in the range 2-4x10^{23}/cm^2. We report on the presence of iron\nlines at 6.8-7.1 keV suggesting that the X-ray flux is produced by accretion of\nmatter from the companion wind characterized by density and temperature\ninhomogeneities.\n", "  We present an integral formalism for constructing scheme transformations in a\nquantum field theory. We apply this to generate several new useful scheme\ntransformations. A comparative analysis is given of these scheme\ntransformations in terms of their series expansion coefficients and their\nresultant effect on the interaction coupling, in particular at a zero of the\nbeta function away from the origin in coupling-constant space.\n", "  We have imaged GM Aur with HST, detected its disk in scattered light at 1400A\nand 1650A, and compared these with observations at 3300A, 5550A, 1.1 microns,\nand 1.6 microns. The scattered light increases at shorter wavelengths. The\nradial surface brightness profile at 3300A shows no evidence of the 24AU radius\ncavity that has been previously observed in sub-mm observations. Comparison\nwith dust grain opacity models indicates the surface of the entire disk is\npopulated with sub-micron grains. We have compiled an SED from 0.1 microns to 1\nmm, and used it to constrain a model of the star+disk system that includes the\nsub-mm cavity using the Monte Carlo Radiative Transfer code by Barbara Whitney.\nThe best-fit model image indicates that the cavity should be detectable in the\nF330W bandpass if the cavity has been cleared of both large and small dust\ngrains, but we do not detect it. The lack of an observed cavity can be\nexplained by the presence of sub-microns grains interior to the sub-mm cavity\nwall. We suggest one explanation for this which could be due to a planet of\nmass <9 Jupiter masses interior to 24 AU. A unique cylindrical structure is\ndetected in the FUV data from the Advanced Camera for Surveys/Solar Blind\nChannel. It is aligned along the system semi-minor axis, but does not resemble\nan accretion-driven jet. The structure is limb-brightened and extends 190 +/-\n35 AU above the disk midplane. The inner radius of the limb-brightening is 40\n+/- 10 AU, just beyond the sub-millimeter cavity wall.\n", "  Context. M dwarfs are considered ideal targets for Doppler radial velocity\nsearches. Nonetheless, the statistics of frequency of low-mass planets hosted\nby low mass stars remains poorly constrained. Aims. Our M-dwarf radial velocity\nmonitoring with HARPS-N can provide a major contribution to the widening of the\ncurrent statistics through the in-depth analysis of accurate radial velocity\nobservations in a narrow range of spectral sub-types (79 stars, between dM0 to\ndM3). Spectral accuracy will enable us to reach the precision needed to detect\nsmall planets with a few earth masses. Our survey will bring a contribute to\nthe surveys devoted to the search for planets around M-dwarfs, mainly focused\non the M-dwarf population of the northern emisphere, for which we will provide\nan estimate of the planet occurence. Methods. We present here a long duration\nradial velocity monitoring of the M1 dwarf star GJ 3998 with HARPS-N to\nidentify periodic signals in the data. Almost simultaneous photometric\nobservations were carried out within the APACHE and EXORAP programs to\ncharacterize the stellar activity and to distinguish from the periodic signals\nthose due to activity and to the presence of planetary companions. Results. The\nradial velocities have a dispersion in excess of their internal errors due to\nat least four superimposed signals, with periods of 30.7, 13.7, 42.5 and 2.65\ndays. The analysis of spectral indices based on Ca II H & K and Halpha lines\ndemonstrates that the periods of 30.7 and 42.5 days are due to chromospheric\ninhomogeneities modulated by stellar rotation and differential rotation. The\nshorter periods of 13.74 +/- 0.02 d and 2.6498 +/- 0.0008 d are well explained\nwith the presence of two planets, with minimum masses of 6.26 +/- 0.79 MEarth\nand 2.47 +/- 0.27 MEarth and distances of 0.089 AU and 0.029 AU from the host,\nrespectively.\n", "  We took advantage of the large collecting area and good timing capabilities\nof the EPIC cameras on-board XMM-Newton to investigate the accretion geometry\nonto the magnetized neutron star hosted in the high mass X-ray binary EXO\n2030+375 during the rise of a source Type-I outburst in 2014. We carried out a\ntiming and spectral analysis of the XMM-Newton observation as function of the\nneutron star spin phase. We used a phenomenological spectral continuum model\ncomprising the required fluorescence emission lines. Two neutral absorption\ncomponents are present: one covering fully the source and one only partially.\nThe same analysis was also carried out on two Suzaku observations of the source\nperformed during outbursts in 2007 and 2012, to search for possible spectral\nvariations at different luminosities. The XMM-Newton data caught the source at\nan X-ray luminosity of $2\\times10^{36}$ erg s$^{-1}$ and revealed the presence\nof a narrow dip-like feature in its pulse profile that was never reported\nbefore. The width of this feature corresponds to about one hundredth of the\nneutron star spin period. From the results of the phase-resolved spectral\nanalysis we suggest that this feature can be ascribed to the self-obscuration\nof the accretion stream passing in front of the observer line of sight. We\ninferred from the Suzaku observation carried out in 2007 that the\nself-obscuration of the accretion stream might produce a significantly wider\nfeature in the neutron star pulsed profile at higher luminosities\n($\\gtrsim$$2\\times10^{37}$ erg s$^{-1}$).\n", "  We present a comprehensive study of the active dM4e star GJ 1243. We use\nprevious observations and ground-based echelle spectroscopy to determine that\nGJ 1243 is a member of the Argus association of field stars, suggesting it is\n$\\sim 30-50$ Myr old. We analyze eleven months of 1-minute cadence data from\nKepler, presenting Kepler flare frequency distributions, as well as determining\ncorrelations between flare energy, amplitude, duration, and decay time. We find\nthat the exponent $\\alpha$ of the power-law flare energy distribution varies in\ntime, primarily due to completeness of sample and the low frequency of\nhigh-energy flares. We also find a deviation from a single power law at high\nenergy. We use ground-based spectroscopic observations simultaneous with the\nKepler data to provide simultaneous photometric and spectroscopic analysis of\nthree low-energy flares, the lowest-energy dMe flares with detailed spectral\nanalysis to date on any star. The spectroscopic data from these flares extend\nconstraints for radiative hydrodynamic (RHD) flare models to a lower energy\nregime than has previously been studied. We use this simultaneous spectroscopy\nand Kepler photometry to develop approximate conversions from the\n\\textit{Kepler} bandpass to the traditional $U$ and $B$ bands. This conversion\nwill be a critical factor in comparing any Kepler flare analyses to the canon\nof previous ground-based flare studies.\n", "  GJ 1132 b is a nearby Earth-sized exoplanet transiting an M dwarf, and is\namongst the most highly characterizable small exoplanets currently known. In\nthis paper we study the interaction of a magma ocean with a water-rich\natmosphere on GJ 1132b and determine that it must have begun with more than 5\nwt% initial water in order to still retain a water-based atmosphere. We also\ndetermine the amount of O2 that can build up in the atmosphere as a result of\nhydrogen dissociation and loss. We find that the magma ocean absorbs at most\n~10% of the O2 produced, whereas more than 90% is lost to space through\nhydrodynamic drag. The most common outcome for GJ 1132 b from our simulations\nis a tenuous atmosphere dominated by O2, although for very large initial water\nabundances atmospheres with several thousands of bars of O2 are possible. A\nsubstantial steam envelope would indicate either the existence of an earlier H2\nenvelope or low XUV flux over the system's lifetime. A steam atmosphere would\nalso imply the continued existence of a magma ocean on GJ 1132 b. Further\nmodeling is needed to study the evolution of CO2 or N2-rich atmospheres on GJ\n1132 b.\n", "  We present the Green Bank Telescope absorption survey of cold atomic hydrogen\n($\\lesssim 300$K) in the inner halo of low-redshift galaxies. The survey aims\nto characterize the cold gas distribution and to address where condensation -\nthe process where ionized gas accreted by galaxies condenses into cold gas\nwithin the disks of galaxies - occurs. Our sample consists of 16 galaxy-quasar\npairs with impact parameters of $\\le$ 20kpc. We detected an HI absorber\nassociated with J0958+3222 (NGC 3067) and HI emission from six galaxies. We\nalso found two \\ion{Ca}{2} absorption system in the archival SDSS data\nassociated with galaxies J0958+3222 and J1228+3706, although the sample was not\nselected based on the presence of metals in absorption. Our detection rate of\nHI absorbers with optical depths of $\\ge 0.06$ is $\\sim$7\\%. We also find that\ncold HI phase ($\\lesssim$300K) is 44($\\pm$18)\\% of the total atomic gas in the\nsightline probing J0958+3222. We find no correlation between the peak optical\ndepth and impact parameter or stellar and HI radii normalized impact\nparameters, $\\rho/\\rm R_{90}$ and $\\rho/\\rm R_{HI}$. We conclude that the\nprocess of condensation of inflowing gas into cold ($\\lesssim$ 300K) HI occurs\nat the $\\rho << 20$kpc. However, the warmer phase of neutral gas (T $\\sim$\n1000K) can exists out to much larger distances as seen in emission maps.\nTherefore, the process of condensation of warm to cold HI is likely occurring\nin stages from ionized to warm HI in the inner halo and then to cold HI very\nclose to the galaxy disk.\n", "  One of the most enigmatic and hitherto unexplained properties of Jupiter\nTrojans is their bimodal color distribution. This bimodality is indicative of\ntwo sub-populations within the Trojans, which have distinct size distributions.\nIn this paper, we present a simple, plausible hypothesis for the origin and\nevolution of the two Trojan color sub-populations. In the framework of\ndynamical instability models of early Solar System evolution, which suggest a\ncommon primordial progenitor population for both Trojans and Kuiper belt\nobjects, we use observational constraints to assert that the color bimodalities\nevident in both minor body populations developed within the primordial\npopulation prior to the onset of instability. We show that, beginning with an\ninitial composition of rock and ices, location-dependent volatile loss through\nsublimation in this primordial population could have led to sharp changes in\nthe surface composition with heliocentric distance. We propose that the\ndepletion or retention of H$_{2}$S ice on the surface of these objects was the\nkey factor in creating an initial color bimodality. Objects that retained\nH$_{2}$S on their surfaces developed characteristically redder colors upon\nirradiation than those that did not. After the bodies from the primordial\npopulation were scattered and emplaced into their current positions, they\npreserved this primordial color bimodality to the present day. We explore\npredictions of the volatile loss model - in particular, the effect of\ncollisions within the Trojan population on the size distributions of the two\nsub-populations - and propose further experimental and observational tests of\nour hypothesis\n", "  Motivated by the recent discovery of a new family of Chromium based\nsuperconductors, we consider a two-band model, where a band of electrons\ndispersing only in one direction interacts with a band of electrons dispersing\nin all three directions. Strong $2k_f$ density fluctuations in the\none-dimensional band induces attractive interactions between the\nthree-dimensional electrons, which, in turn makes the system superconducting.\nSolving the associated Eliashberg equations, we obtain a gap function which is\npeaked at the \"poles\" of the three-dimensional Fermi sphere, and decreases\ntowards the \"equator\". When strong enough local repulsion is included, the gap\nactually changes sign around the \"equator\" and nodal rings are formed. These\nnodal rings manifest themselves in several experimentally observable\nquantities, some of which resemble unconventional observations in the newly\ndiscovered superconductors which motivated this work.\n", "  Low resolution (4.5 to 5 Angstroem) spectra of 58 blue supergiant stars\ndistributed over the disk of the Magellanic spiral galaxy NGC 55 in the\nSculptor group are analyzed by means of non-LTE techniques to determine stellar\ntemperatures, gravities and metallicities (from iron peak and alpha-elements).\nA metallicity gradient of -0.22 +/- 0.06$ dex/R_25 is detected. The central\nmetallicity on a logarithmic scale relative to the Sun is [Z] = -0.37 +\\- 0.03.\nA chemical evolution model using the observed distribution of stellar and\ninterstellar medium gas mass column densities reproduces the observed\nmetallicity distribution well and reveals a recent history of strong galactic\nmass accretion and wind outflows with accretion and mass-loss rates of the\norder of the star formation rate. There is an indication of spatial\ninhomogeneity in metallicity. In addition, the relatively high central\nmetallicity of the disk confirms that two extra-planar metal poor HII regions\ndetected in previous work 1.13 to 2.22 kpc above the galactic plane are ionized\nby massive stars formed in-situ outside the disk. For a sub-sample of\nsupergiants, for which Hubble Space Telescope photometry is available, the\nflux-weighted gravity--luminosity relationship is used to determine a distance\nmodulus of 26.85 +\\- 0.10 mag.\n", "  We determine the exact time-resolved photoemission spectroscopy for a nesting\ndriven charge-density-wave (described by the spinless Falicov-Kimball model\nwithin dynamical mean-field theory). The pump-probe experiment involves two\nlight pulses: the first is an ultrashort intense pump pulse that excites the\nsystem into nonequilibrium, and the second is a lower amplitude higher\nfrequency probe pulse that photoexcites electrons. We examine three different\ncases: the strongly correlated metal, the quantum-critical charge density wave\nand the critical Mott insulator. Our results show that the quantum critical\ncharge density wave has an ultra efficient relaxation channel that allows\nelectrons to be de-excited during the pump pulse, resulting in little net\nexcitation. In contrast, the metal and the Mott insulator show excitations that\nare closer to what one expects from these systems. In addition, the pump field\nproduces spectral band narrowing, peak sharpening, and a spectral gap\nreduction, all of which rapidly return to their field free values after the\npump is over.\n", "  Mass-loss rate is one of the most important stellar parameters. We aim to\nprovide mass-loss rates as a function of subdwarf parameters and to apply the\nformula for individual subdwarfs, to predict the wind terminal velocities, to\nestimate the influence of the magnetic field and X-ray ionization on the\nstellar wind, and to study the interaction of subdwarf wind with mass loss from\nBe and cool companions. We used our kinetic equilibrium (NLTE) wind models with\nthe radiative force determined from the radiative transfer equation in the\ncomoving frame (CMF) to predict the wind structure of subluminous hot stars.\nOur models solve stationary hydrodynamical equations, that is the equation of\ncontinuity, equation of motion, and energy equation and predict basic wind\nparameters. We predicted the wind mass-loss rate as a function of stellar\nparameters, namely the stellar luminosity, effective temperature, and\nmetallicity. The derived wind parameters (mass-loss rates and terminal\nvelocities) agree with the values derived from the observations. The radiative\nforce is not able to accelerate the homogeneous wind for stars with low\neffective temperatures and high surface gravities. We discussed the properties\nof winds of individual subdwarfs. The X-ray irradiation may inhibit the flow in\nbinaries with compact components. In binaries with Be components, the winds\ninteract with the disk of the Be star. Stellar winds exist in subluminous stars\nwith low gravities or high effective temperatures. Despite their low mass-loss\nrates, they are detectable in the ultraviolet spectrum and cause X-ray\nemission. Subdwarf stars may lose a significant part of their mass during the\nevolution. The angular momentum loss in magnetic subdwarfs with wind may\nexplain their low rotational velocities. Stellar winds are especially important\nin binaries, where they may be accreted on a compact or cool companion.\n(abridged)\n", "  We investigate an infrared-excess source called G2 or Dusty S-cluster Object\n(DSO) moving on a highly eccentric orbit around the Galaxy's central black\nhole, Sgr A*. We use, for the first time, near-infrared polarimetric imaging\ndata to determine the nature and the properties of the DSO, and obtain an\nimproved K_s-band identification of this source in median polarimetry images of\ndifferent observing years. The source starts to deviate from the stellar\nconfusion in 2008, and it does not show any flux density variability over the\nyears we analyzed it. We measure the polarization degree and angle of the DSO\nbetween 2008 and 2012 and conclude, based on the significance analysis on\npolarization parameters, that it is an intrinsically polarized source (>20%)\nwith a varying polarization angle as it approaches Sgr A* position. DSO shows a\nnear-infrared excess of K_s-L' > 3 that remains compact close to the pericenter\nof its orbit. Its observed parameters and the significant polarization obtained\nin this work show that the DSO might be a dust-enshrouded young star, forming a\nbow shock as it approaches the super massive black hole. The significantly high\nmeasured polarization degree indicates that it has a non-spherical geometry and\nit can be modelled as a combination of a bow shock with a bipolar wind of the\nstar. We use a 3D radiative transfer model that can reproduce the observed\nproperties of the source such as the total flux density and the polarization\ndegree. We obtain that the change of the polarization angle can be due to an\nintrinsic change in the source structure. Accretion disc precession of the\nyoung star in the gravitational field of the black hole can lead to the change\nof the bipolar outflow and therefore the polarization angle variation. It might\nalso be the result of the source interaction with the ambient medium.\n", "  We present results of an investigation into the formation of nitrogen-bearing\nmolecules in the atmosphere of Titan. We extend a previous model (Li et al.\n2015, 2016) to cover the region below the tropopause, so the new model treats\nthe atmosphere from Titan's surface to an altitude of 1500 km. We consider the\neffects of condensation and sublimation using a continuous, numerically stable\nmethod. This is coupled with parameterized treatments of the sedimentation of\nthe aerosols and their condensates, and the formation of haze particles. These\nprocesses affect the abundances of heavier species such as the nitrogen-bearing\nmolecules, but have less effect on the abundances of lighter molecules. Removal\nof molecules to form aerosols also plays a role in determining the mixing\nratios, in particular of HNC, HC3N and HCN. We find good agreement with the\nrecently detected mixing ratios of C2H5CN, with condensation playing an\nimportant role in determining the abundance of this molecule below 500 km. Of\nparticular interest is the chemistry of acrylonitrile (C2H3CN) which has been\nsuggested by Stevenson et al. (2015) as a molecule that could form biological\nmembranes in an oxygen-deficient environment. With the inclusion of haze\nformation we find good agreement of our model predictions of acrylonitrile with\nthe available observations.\n", "  We show that an optimized projection functions method can automatically\nconstruct maximally localized Wannier functions even for bands with nontrivial\ntopology. We demonstrate this method on a tight-binding model of a\ntwo-dimensional $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological insulator, on a three-dimensional\nstrong $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological insulator, as well as on first-principles\ndensity functional theory calculated valence states of Bi$_2$Se$_3$. In all\ncases, the resulting Wannier functions contain large imaginary components and\nare more extended than those in the topologically trivial phase.\n", "  We revisit the $\\rho$-meson longitudinal leading-twist distribution amplitude\n(DA) $\\phi_{2;\\rho}^\\|$ by using the QCD sum rules approach within the\nbackground field theory. To improve the accuracy of the sum rules for its\nmoments $\\langle\\xi_{n;\\rho}^\\|\\rangle$, we include the next-to-leading order\nQCD correction to the perturbative part and keep all non-perturbative\ncondensates up to dimension-six consistently within the background field\ntheory. The first two moments read $\\langle \\xi_{2;\\rho}^\\| \\rangle|_{1{\\rm\nGeV}} = 0.241(28)$ and $\\langle \\xi_{4;\\rho}^\\| \\rangle|_{1{\\rm GeV}} =\n0.109(10)$, indicating a double humped behavior for $\\phi_{2;\\rho}^\\|$ at small\nenergy scale. As an application, we apply them to the $B\\to \\rho $ transition\nform factors within the QCD light-cone sum rules, which are key components for\nthe decay width $\\Gamma(B\\to \\rho \\ell \\nu_\\ell)$. To compare with the\nworld-average of $\\Gamma(B\\to \\rho \\ell \\nu_\\ell)$ issued by Particle Data\nGroup, we predict $|V_{\\rm ub}| = 3.19^{+0.65}_{-0.62}$, which agrees with the\nBABAR and Omn\\`{e}s parameterization prediction within errors.\n", "  We present the spatially resolved star formation history (SFH) of the Carina\ndwarf spheroidal galaxy, obtained from deep, wide-field g,r imaging and a\nmetallicity distribution from the literature. Our photometry covers $\\sim2$\ndeg$^2$, reaching up to $\\sim10$ times the half-light radius of Carina with a\ncompleteness higher than $50\\%$ at $g\\sim24.5$, more than one magnitude fainter\nthan the oldest turnoff. This is the first time a combination of depth and\ncoverage of this quality has been used to derive the SFH of Carina, enabling us\nto trace its different populations with unprecedented accuracy. We find that\nCarina's SFH consists of two episodes well separated by a star formation\ntemporal gap. These episodes occurred at old ($>10$ Gyr) and intermediate\n($2$-$8$ Gyr) ages. Our measurements show that the old episode comprises the\nmajority of the population, accounting for $54\\pm5\\%$ of the stellar mass\nwithin $1.3$ times the King tidal radius, while the total stellar mass derived\nfor Carina is $1.60\\pm0.09\\times 10^{6} M_{\\rm{\\odot}}$, and the stellar\nmass-to-light ratio $1.8\\pm0.2$. The SFH derived is consistent with no recent\nstar formation which hints that the observed blue plume is due to blue\nstragglers. We conclude that the SFH of Carina evolved independently of the\ntidal field of the Milky Way, since the frequency and duration of its star\nformation events do not correlate with its orbital parameters. This result is\nsupported by the age/metallicity relation observed in Carina, and the gradients\ncalculated indicating that outer regions are older and more metal poor.\n", "  Spontaneous symmetry breaking is deeply related to dimensionality of system.\nThe Neel order going with spontaneous breaking of $U(1)$ symmetry is safely\nallowed at any temperature for three-dimensional systems but allowed only at\nzero temperature for purely two-dimensional systems. We closely investigate how\nsmoothly the ordering process of the three-dimensional system is modulated into\nthat of the two-dimensional one with reduction of dimensionality, considering\nspatially anisotropic quantum antiferromagnets. We first show that the N\\'eel\ntemperature is kept finite even in the two-dimensional limit although the\nN\\'eel order is greatly suppressed for low-dimensionality. This feature of the\nN\\'eel temperature is highly nontrivial, which dictates how the order parameter\nis squashed under the reduction of dimensionality. Next we investigate this\ndimensional modulation of the order parameter. We develop our argument taking\nas example a coupled spin-ladder system relevant for experimental studies. The\nordering process is investigated multidirectionally using theoretical\ntechniques of a mean-field method combined with analytical (exact solutions of\nquantum field theories) or numerial (density-matrix renormalization-group)\nmethod, a variational method, a renormalization-group study, linear spin-wave\ntheory, and quantum Monte-Carlo simulation. We show that these methods\nindependent of each other lead to the same conclusion about the dimensional\nmodulation.\n", "  We have designed and developed, from scratch, a global circulation model\nnamed THOR that solves the three-dimensional non-hydrostatic Euler equations.\nOur general approach lifts the commonly used assumptions of a shallow\natmosphere and hydrostatic equilibrium. We solve the \"pole problem\" (where\nconverging meridians on a sphere lead to increasingly smaller time steps near\nthe poles) by implementing an icosahedral grid. Irregularities in the grid,\nwhich lead to grid imprinting, are smoothed using the \"spring dynamics\"\ntechnique. We validate our implementation of spring dynamics by examining\ncalculations of the divergence and gradient of test functions. To prevent the\ncomputational time step from being bottlenecked by having to resolve sound\nwaves, we implement a split-explicit method together with a horizontally\nexplicit and vertically implicit integration. We validate our global\ncirculation model by reproducing the Earth and also the hot Jupiter-like\nbenchmark tests. THOR was designed to run on Graphics Processing Units (GPUs),\nwhich allows for physics modules (radiative transfer, clouds, chemistry) to be\nadded in the future, and is part of the open-source Exoclimes Simulation\nPlatform (ESP; www.exoclime.org).\n", "  We used a combination of optical and near-UV Hubble Space Telescope\nphotometry and FLAMES/ESO-VLT high-resolution spectroscopy to characterize the\nstellar content of the old and massive globular cluster (GC) NGC121 in the\nSmall Magellanic Cloud (SMC). We report on the detection of multiple stellar\npopulations, the first case in the SMC stellar cluster system. This result\nenforces the emerging scenario in which the presence of multiple stellar\npopulations is a distinctive-feature of old and massive GCs regardless of the\nenvironment, as far as the light element distribution is concerned. We find\nthat second population (SG) stars are more centrally concentrated than first\n(FG) ones. More interestingly, at odds with what typically observed in Galactic\nGCs, we find that NGC121 is the only cluster so far to be dominated by FG stars\nthat account for more than 65% of the total cluster mass. In the framework\nwhere GCs were born with a 90-95% of FG stars, this observational finding would\nsuggest that either NGC121 experienced a milder stellar mass-loss with respect\nto Galactic GCs or it formed a smaller fraction of SG stars.\n", "  Berry curvature hot spots in two-dimensional materials with broken inversion\nsymmetry are responsible for the existence of transverse valley currents, which\ngive rise to giant nonlocal dc voltages. Recent experiments in high-quality\ngapped graphene have highlighted a saturation of the nonlocal resistance as a\nfunction of the longitudinal charge resistivity $\\rho_{{\\rm c}, xx}$, when the\nsystem is driven deep into the insulating phase. The origin of this saturation\nis, to date, unclear. In this work we show that this behavior is fully\ncompatible with bulk topological transport in the regime of large valley Hall\nangles (VHAs). We demonstrate that, for a fixed value of the valley diffusion\nlength, the dependence of the nonlocal resistance on $\\rho_{{\\rm c}, xx}$\nweakens for increasing VHAs, transitioning from the standard $\\rho^3_{{\\rm c},\nxx}$ power-law to a result that is independent of $\\rho_{{\\rm c}, xx}$.\n", "  At molecular scales, fluctuations play a significant role and prevent\nbiomolecular processes from always proceeding in a preferred direction, raising\nthe question of how limited amounts of free energy can be dissipated to obtain\ndirected progress. We examine the system and process characteristics that\nefficiently break time-reversal symmetry at fixed energy loss; in particular\nfor a simple model of a molecular machine, an intermediate energy barrier\nproduces unusually high asymmetry for a given dissipation. We relate the\nsymmetry-breaking factors found in this model to recent observations of\nbiomolecular machines.\n", "  We regulate in Euclidean space the Jacobian under scale transformations for\ntwo-dimensional nonrelativistic fermions and bosons interacting via contact\ninteractions and compare the resulting scaling anomalies. For fermions,\nGrassmannian integration inverts the Jacobian: however, this effect is\ncancelled by the regularization procedure and a result similar to that of\nbosons is attained. We show the independence of the result with respect to the\nregulating function, and show the robustness of our methods by comparing the\nprocedure with an effective potential method using both cutoff and\n$\\zeta$-function regularization.\n", "  The determination of the size of the convective core of main-sequence stars\nis usually dependent on the construction of models of stars. Here we introduce\na method to estimate the radius of the convective core of main-sequence stars\nwith masses between about 1.1 and 1.5 $M_{\\odot}$ from observed frequencies of\nlow-degree p-modes. A formula is proposed to achieve the estimation. The values\nof the radius of the convective core of four known stars are successfully\nestimated by the formula. The radius of the convective core of KIC 9812850\nestimated by the formula is $\\mathbf{0.140\\pm0.028}$ $R_{\\odot}$. In order to\nconfirm this prediction, a grid of evolutionary models were computed. The value\nof the convective-core radius of the best-fit model of KIC 9812850 is $0.149$\n$R_{\\odot}$, which is in good agreement with that estimated by the formula from\nobserved frequencies. The formula aids in understanding the interior structure\nof stars directly from observed frequencies. The understanding is not dependent\non the construction of models.\n", "  We analyze multi-spacecraft observations associated with the 2012 July 12\nCoronal Mass Ejection (CME), covering the source region on the Sun from SDO,\nstereoscopic imaging observations from STEREO, magnetic field characteristics\nat MESSENGER, and type II radio burst and in situ measurements from Wind. A\ntriangulation method based on STEREO stereoscopic observations is employed to\ndetermine the kinematics of the CME, and the outcome is compared with the\nresult derived from the type II radio burst with a solar wind electron density\nmodel. A Grad-Shafranov technique is applied to Wind in situ data to\nreconstruct the flux-rope structure and compare it with the observation of the\nsolar source region, which helps understand the geo-effectiveness associated\nwith the CME structure. Conclusions are as follows: (1) the CME undergoes an\nimpulsive acceleration, a rapid deceleration before reaching MESSENGER, and\nthen a gradual deceleration out to 1 AU, which should be noticed in CME\nkinematics models; (2) the type II radio burst was probably produced from a\nhigh-density interaction region between the CME-driven shock and a nearby\nstreamer or from the shock flank with lower heights, which implies\nuncertainties in the determination of CME kinematics using solely type II radio\nbursts; (3) the flux-rope orientation and chirality deduced from in situ\nreconstruction at Wind agree with those obtained from solar source\nobservations; (4) the prolonged southward magnetic field near the Earth is\nmainly from the axial component of the largely southward inclined flux rope,\nwhich indicates the importance of predicting both the flux-rope orientation and\nmagnetic field components in geomagnetic activity forecasting.\n", "  We introduce a hybrid method for dielectric-metal composites that describes\nthe dynamics of the metallic system classically whilst retaining a quantum\ndescription of the dielectric. The time-dependent dipole moment of the\nclassical system is mimicked by the introduction of projected equations of\nmotion (PEOM) and the coupling between the two systems is achieved through an\neffective dipole-dipole interaction. To benchmark this method, we model a test\nsystem (semiconducting quantum dot-metal nanoparticle hybrid). We begin by\nexamining the energy absorption rate, showing agreement between the PEOM method\nand the analytical rotating wave approximation (RWA) solution. We then\ninvestigate population inversion and show that the PEOM method provides an\naccurate model for the interaction under ultrashort pulse excitation where the\ntraditional RWA breaks down.\n", "  We present a newly developed time-dependent three-dimensional multi-zone\nhadronic blazar emission model. By coupling a Fokker-Planck based\nlepto-hadronic particle evolution code 3DHad with a polarization-dependent\nradiation transfer code, 3DPol, we are able to study the time-dependent\nradiation and polarization signatures of a hadronic blazar model for the first\ntime. Our current code is limited to parameter regimes in which the hadronic\n$\\gamma$-ray output is dominated by proton synchrotron emission, neglecting\npion production. Our results demonstrate that the time-dependent flux and\npolarization signatures are generally dominated by the relation between the\nsynchrotron cooling and the light crossing time scale, which is largely\nindependent of the exact model parameters. We find that unlike the low-energy\npolarization signatures, which can vary rapidly in time, the high-energy\npolarization signatures appear stable. As a result, future high-energy\npolarimeters may be able to distinguish such signatures from the lower and more\nrapidly variable polarization signatures expected in leptonic models.\n", "  Chemical abundances are presented for 25 M31 globular clusters (GCs), based\non moderately high resolution (R = 22, 500) H-band integrated light spectra\nfrom the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE).\nInfrared spectra offer lines from new elements, of different strengths, and at\nhigher excitation potentials compared to the optical. Integrated abundances of\nC, N, and O are derived from CO, CN, and OH molecular features, while Fe, Na,\nMg, Al, Si, K, Ca, and Ti abundances are derived from atomic features. These\nabundances are compared to previous results from the optical, demonstrating the\nvalidity and value of infrared integrated light analyses. The CNO abundances\nare consistent with typical tip of the red giant branch stellar abundances, but\nare systematically offset from optical, Lick index abundances. With a few\nexceptions, the other abundances agree between the optical and the infrared\nwithin the 1{\\sigma} uncertainties. The first integrated K abundances are also\npresented, and demonstrate that K tracks the alpha-elements. The combination of\ninfrared and optical abundances allows better determinations of GC properties,\nand enables probes of the multiple populations in extragalactic GCs. In\nparticular, the integrated effects of the Na/O anticorrelation can be directly\nexamined for the first time.\n", "  HD 208472 is among the most active RS~CVn binaries with cool starspots.\nDecade-long photometry has shown that the spots seem to change their\nlongitudinal appearance with a period of about six years, coherent with\nbrightness variations. Our aim is to spatially resolve the stellar surface of\nHD 208472 and relate the photometric results to the true longitudinal and\nlatitudinal spot appearance. Furthermore, we investigate the surface\ndifferential rotation pattern of the star. We employed three years of\nhigh-resolution spectroscopic data with a high signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) from\nthe STELLA robotic observatory and determined new and more precise stellar\nphysical parameters. Precalculated synthetic spectra were fit to each of these\nspectra, and we provide new spot-corrected orbital elements. A sample of 34\nabsorption lines per spectrum was used to calculate mean line profiles with a\nS/N of several hundred. A total of 13 temperature Doppler images were\nreconstructed from these line profiles with the inversion code iMap.\nDifferential rotation was investigated by cross-correlating successive Doppler\nimages in each observing season. Spots on HD 208472 are distributed preferably\nat high latitudes and less frequently around mid-to-low latitudes. No polar-cap\nlike structure is seen at any epoch. We observed a flip-flop event between 2009\nand 2010, manifested as a flip of the spot activity from phase 0.0 to phase\n0.5, while the overall brightness of the star continued to increase and reached\nan all-time maximum in 2014. Cross-correlation of successive Doppler images\nsuggests a solar-like differential rotation that is ~15 times weaker than that\nof the Sun.\n", "  Domain walls in three-dimensional Weyl semimetals, formed by localized\nmagnetic moments, are investigated. There appear bound states around the domain\nwall with the discrete spectrum, among which we find \"Fermi arc\" states with\nthe linear dispersion. The Fermi arc modes contribute to the electric charge\nand current localized at the domain wall, which reveal a universal behavior\ndepending only on chemical potential and the splitting of the Weyl nodes. This\nequilibrium current can be traced back to the chiral magnetic effect, or the\nedge counterpart of the anomalous Hall effect in the bulk. We propose a new way\nto manipulate the motion of the domain wall, accompanied with the localized\ncharge, by applying an external electric field.\n", "  We investigate the feasibility of electroweak baryogenesis in a two-Higgs\ndoublet model with lepton flavor violation. By scrutinizing the heavy Higgs\nboson mass spectrum, regions satisfying both strong first-order electroweak\nphase transition and the muon $g-2$ anomaly are identified. We also estimate\nthe baryon number density by exploiting extra Yukawa couplings in the\n$\\mu$-$\\tau$ sector. It is found that a CP-violating source term can be\nenhanced by the $\\mu$-$\\tau$ flavor-violating coupling together with the extra\n$\\tau$ coupling. With $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ Yukawa couplings and CP-violating\nphases, the observed baryon number density is marginally produced under a\ngenerous assumption for the bubble wall profile.\n", "  We investigate deviations from the plane wave model in the interaction of\ncharged particles with strong electromagnetic fields. A general result is that\nintegrability of the dynamics is lost when going from lightlike to timelike or\nspacelike field dependence. For a special scenario in the classical regime we\nshow how the radiation spectrum in the spacelike (undulator) case becomes\nwell-approximated by the plane wave model in the high energy limit, despite the\ntwo systems being Lorentz inequivalent. In the quantum problem, there is no\nanalogue of the WKB-exact Volkov solution. Nevertheless, WKB and uniform-WKB\napproaches give good approximations in all cases considered. Other approaches\nthat reduce the underlying differential equations from second to first order\nare found to miss the correct physics for situations corresponding to barrier\ntransmission and wide-angle scattering.\n", "  We report on an ultraviolet spectroscopic survey of red giants observed by\nthe Hubble Space Telescope, focusing on spectra of the Mg II h & k lines near\n2800 A in order to study stellar chromospheric emission, winds, and\nastrospheric absorption. We focus on spectral types between K2 III and M5 III,\na spectral type range with stars that are noncoronal, but possessing strong,\nchromospheric winds. We find a very tight relation between Mg II surface flux\nand photospheric temperature, supporting the notion that all K2-M5 III stars\nare emitting at a basal flux level. Wind velocities (V_w) are generally found\nto decrease with spectral type, with V_w decreasing from ~40 km/s at K2 III to\n~20 km/s at M5 III. We find two new detections of astrospheric absorption, for\nSigma Pup (K5 III) and Gamma Eri (M1 III). This absorption signature had\npreviously only been detected for Alpha Tau (K5 III). For the three\nastrospheric detections the temperature of the wind after the termination shock\ncorrelates with V_w, but is lower than predicted by the Rankine-Hugoniot shock\njump conditions, consistent with the idea that red giant termination shocks are\nradiative shocks rather than simple hydrodynamic shocks. A full hydrodynamic\nsimulation of the Gamma Eri astrosphere is provided to explore this further.\n", "  We introduce a new set of eight Milky Way-sized cosmological simulations\nperformed using the AMR code ART + Hydrodynamics in a LCDM cosmology. The set\nof zoom-in simulations covers present-day virial masses in the 0.83-1.56 x\n10^12 msun range and is carried out with our simple but effective deterministic\nstar formation (SF) and ``explosive' stellar feedback prescriptions. The work\nis focused on showing the goodness of the simulated set of ``field' Milky\nWay-sized galaxies. Our results are as follows. (a) The circular velocity\ncurves of our simulated galaxies are nearly flat. (b) Runs ending with a\nsignificant disk component, for their stellar masses, have V_max, radius, SF\nrate, gas fraction, and specific angular momentum values consistent with\nobservations of late-type galaxies. (C) The two most spheroid-dominated\ngalaxies formed in halos with late active merger histories, but other run that\nends also as spheroid-dominated, never had major mergers. (d) Our simulations\nare consistent with the empirical stellar-to-halo mass correlation, and those\nthat end as disk-dominated, evolve mostly along the low-mass branch of this\ncorrelation. (e) Moreover, since the last 6.5-10 Gyr, the baryonic/stellar and\nhalo mass growth histories are proportional. (f) Within Rvir ~ 25-50% of the\nbaryons are missed. (g) The z ~ 0 gas velocity dispersion profiles, sigma_z(r),\nare nearly flat and can be mostly explained by the kinetic energy injected by\nstars. (h) The average values of sigma_z increase at higher redshifts,\nfollowing roughly the shape of the SF history.\n", "  The central star of the planetary nebula NGC 1514 is among the visually\nbrightest central stars in the sky (V=9.5). It has long been known to show a\ncomposite spectrum, consisting of an A-type star and a much hotter star\nresponsible for the ionization of the surrounding nebula. These two stars have\nalways been assumed to form a binary system. High-resolution spectrograms\nobtained with Espadons at the CFHT on Mauna Kea have allowed to measure good\nradial velocities for both stars. They differ by 13 $\\pm$ 2 km s$^{-1}$. The\nstellar velocities have not changed after 500 days. We have also estimated the\nmetallicity of the cooler star. Combining these data with other information\navailable in the literature, we conclude that, unless all the published nebular\nradial velocities are systematically wrong, the cooler star is just a chance\nalignment, and the two stars are not orbiting each other. The cooler star\ncannot have played any role in the formation of NGC 1514.\n", "  Recently, a new \"type-II\" Weyl fermion, which exhibits exotic phenomena such\nas angle-dependent chiral anomaly, was discovered in a new phase of matter\nwhere electron and hole pockets contact at isolated Weyl points. [Nature\n\\textbf{527}, 495 (2015)] This raises an interesting question whether its\ncounterpart, i.e., type-II \\textit{Dirac} fermion, exists in real materials.\nHere, we predict the existence of symmetry-protected type-II Dirac fermions in\na class of transition metal dichalcogenide materials. Our first-principles\ncalculations on PtSe$_2$ reveal its bulk type-II Dirac fermions which are\ncharacterized by strongly tilted Dirac cones, novel surface states, and exotic\ndoping-driven Lifshitz transition. Our results show that the existence of\ntype-II Dirac fermions in PtSe$_2$-type materials is closely related to its\nstructural $P\\bar{3}m1$ symmetry, which provides useful guidance for the\nexperimental realization of type-II Dirac fermions and intriguing physical\nproperties distinct from those of the standard Dirac fermions known before.\n", "  Using both DFT as well as $G_0W_0$ calculations, we investigate static and\ndynamic effects on the phosphorene band gap upon deposition and encapsulation\non/in BN multilayers. We demonstrate how competing long- and short-range\neffects cause the phosphorene band gap to increase at low P - BN interlayer\nspacings, while the band gap is found to drop below that of isolated\nphosphorene in the BN/P bilayer at intermediate distances around 4 \\AA.\nSubsequent stacking of BN layers, i.e. BN/BN/P and BN/BN/BN/P is found to have\na negligible effect at the DFT level while at the $G_0W_0$ increased screening\nlowers the band gap as compared to the BN/P bilayer. Encapsulation between two\nBN layer is found to increase the phosphorene band gap by a value approximately\ntwice that observed when going from freestanding phosphorene to BN/P. We\nfurther investigate the use of the $\\rm{GLLB-SC}$ functional as a starting\npoint for $G_0W_0$ calculations showing it to, in the case of phosphorene,\nyield results close to those obtained from $GW_0@\\rm{PBE}$ calculations.\n", "  We consider the 2D alternate quantum walk on a cylinder. We concentrate on\nthe study of the motion along the open dimension, in the spirit of looking at\nthe closed coordinate as a small or \"hidden\" extra dimension. If one starts\nfrom localized initial conditions on the lattice, the dynamics of the quantum\nwalk that is obtained after tracing out the small dimension shows the\ncontribution of several components, which can be understood from the study of\nthe dispersion relations for this problem. In fact, these components originate\nfrom the contribution of the possible values of the quasi-momentum in the\nclosed dimension. In the continuous space-time limit, the different components\nmanifest as a set of Dirac equations, with each quasi-momentum providing the\nvalue of the corresponding mass. We briefly discuss the possible link of these\nideas to the simulation of high energy physical theories that include extra\ndimensions. Finally, entanglement between the coin and spatial degrees of\nfreedom is studied, showing that the entanglement entropy clearly overcomes the\nvalue reached with only one spatial dimension.\n", "  We present a large survey of giant pulses from the Crab Pulsar as observed\nwith the first station of the Long Wavelength Array. Automated methods for\ndetecting giant pulses at low frequencies where scattering becomes prevalent\nare also explored. More than 1400 pulses were detected across four frequency\nbands between 20 - 84 MHz over a seven month period beginning in 2013, with\nadditional followup observations in late 2014 and early 2015. A handful of\nthese pulses were detected simultaneously across all four frequency bands. We\nexamine pulse characteristics, including pulse broadening and power law indices\nfor amplitude distributions. We find that the flux density increases toward\nshorter wavelengths, consistent with a spectral turnover at 100 MHz. Our\nobservations uniquely span multiple scattering epochs, manifesting as a notable\ntrend in the number of detections per observation. These results are\ncharacteristic of the variable interface between the synchrotron nebula and the\nsurrounding interstellar medium.\n", "  We construct a new class of superstrata, the regular supergravity solutions\ndescribing the microstates of D1-D5-P black holes. Our solutions are obtained\nby adding momentum charge to the D1-D5 geometries based on multiple concentric\nKaluza-Klein monopoles.\n", "  Interstellar complex organic molecules (COMs) are commonly observed during\nstar formation, and are proposed to form through radical chemistry in icy grain\nmantles. Reactions between ions and neutral molecules in ices may provide an\nalternative cold channel to complexity, as ion-neutral reactions are thought to\nhave low or even no energy barriers. Here we present a study of a the kinetics\nand mechanisms of a potential ion-generating acid-base reaction between\nNH$_{3}$ and HCOOH to form the salt NH$_{4}^{+}$HCOO$^{-}$. We observe salt\ngrowth at temperatures as low as 15K, indicating that this reaction is feasible\nin cold environments. The kinetics of salt growth are best fit by a two-step\nmodel involving a slow \"pre-reaction\" step followed by a fast reaction step.\nThe reaction energy barrier is determined to be 70 $\\pm$ 30K with a\npre-exponential factor 1.4 $\\pm$ 0.4 x 10$^{-3}$ s$^{-1}$. The pre-reaction\nrate varies under different experimental conditions and likely represents a\ncombination of diffusion and orientation of reactant molecules. For a\ndiffusion-limited case, the pre-reaction barrier is 770 $\\pm$ 110K with a\npre-exponential factor of $\\sim$7.6 x 10$^{-3}$ s$^{-1}$. Acid-base chemistry\nof common ice constituents is thus a potential cold pathway to generating ions\nin interstellar ices.\n", "  In this paper we study the high energy behaviour of Electroweak Standard\nModel for a nonzero Weinberg angle $\\theta_{W}$. We evaluate the spectrum of\nthe electroweak pomeron and demonstrate that the leading intercept is given by\n$\\alpha _{\\rm e.w.}4 \\ln 2$ and does not depend on the mixing angle\n$\\theta_{W}$. Due to its very small numerical value, we conclude that the high\nenergy behaviour of electroweak theory cannot be discussed without including\nthe QCD Pomeron which, at sufficiently large energies, will dominate.\n", "  Exact expressions have been proposed for correlation functions of the\nlarge-$N$ (planar) limit of the $(1+1)$-dimensional ${\\rm SU}(N)\\times {\\rm\nSU}(N)$ principal chiral sigma model. These were obtained with the form-factor\nbootstrap. The short-distance form of the two-point function of the scaling\nfield $\\Phi(x)$, was found to be $N^{-1}\\langle {\\rm Tr}\\,\\Phi(0)^{\\dagger}\n\\Phi(x)\\rangle=C_{2}\\ln^{2}mx$, where $m$ is the mass gap, in agreement with\nthe perturbative renormalization group. Here we point out that the universal\ncoefficient $C_{2}$, is proportional to the mean first-passage time of a\nL\\'{e}vy flight in one dimension. This observation enables us to calculate\n$C_{2}=1/16\\pi$.\n", "  We investigate the thermodynamics of integrable classical field theories\nunder the effect of a random initial configuration, motivated by the\nnonequilibrium evolution of quantum field theories. The approach to thermal\nequilibrium is analysed with numerical simulations and confronted with\nanalytical results. The possibility of comparing the classical results with\ntheir quantum counterparts could be a way of inferring the behaviour of\nout-of-equilibrium quantum field theories during the thermalization process.\n", "  A fast-turnaround pipeline for realtime data reduction plays an essential\nrole in discovering and permitting follow-up observations to young supernovae\nand fast-evolving transients in modern time-domain surveys. In this paper, we\npresent the realtime image subtraction pipeline in the intermediate Palomar\nTransient Factory. By using high-performance computing, efficient database, and\nmachine learning algorithms, this pipeline manages to reliably deliver\ntransient candidates within ten minutes of images being taken. Our experience\nin using high performance computing resources to process big data in astronomy\nserves as a trailblazer to dealing with data from large-scale time-domain\nfacilities in near future.\n", "  Radio pulsars are believed to have their emission powered by the loss of\nrotational kinetic energy. By contrast, magnetars show intense X-ray and\ngamma-ray radiation whose luminosity greatly exceeds that due to spin-down and\nis believed to be powered by intense internal magnetic fields. A basic\nprediction of this picture is that radio pulsars of high magnetic field should\nshow magnetar-like emission. Here we report on a magnetar-like X-ray outburst\nfrom the radio pulsar PSR J1119-6127, heralded by two short bright X-ray bursts\non 2016 July 27 and 28 (Kennea et al. 2016; Younes et al. 2016). Using\nTarget-of-Opportunity data from the Swift X-ray Telescope and NuSTAR, we show\nthat this pulsar's flux has brightened by a factor of > 160 in the 0.5-10 keV\nband, and its previously soft X-ray spectrum has undergone a strong hardening,\nwith strong pulsations appearing for the first time above 2.5 keV, with\nphase-averaged emission detectable up to 25 keV. By comparing Swift-XRT and\nNuSTAR timing data with a pre-outburst ephemeris derived from Fermi Large Area\nTelescope data, we find that the source has contemporaneously undergone a large\nspin-up glitch of amplitude df/f = 5.74(8) E-6. The collection of phenomena\nobserved thus far in this outburst strongly mirrors those in most magnetar\noutbursts and provides an unambiguous connection between the radio pulsar and\nmagnetar populations.\n", "  We have conducted a spectral line survey observation in the 3 mm band toward\nthe low-metallicity dwarf galaxy IC10 with the 45 m radio telescope of Nobeyama\nRadio Observatory to explore its chemical composition at a molecular-cloud\nscale (~80 pc). The CS, SO, CCH, HCN, HCO+, and HNC lines are detected for the\nfirst time in this galaxy in addition to the CO and 13CO lines, while c-C3H2,\nCH3OH, CN, C18O, and N2H+ lines are not detected. The spectral intensity\npattern is found to be similar to those observed toward molecular clouds in the\nLarge Magellanic Cloud, whose metallicity is as low as IC10. Nitrogen-bearing\nspecies are deficient in comparison with the Galactic molecular clouds due to a\nlower elemental abundance of nitrogen. CCH is abundant in comparison with\nGalactic translucent clouds, whereas CH3OH may be deficient. These\ncharacteristic trends for CCH and CH3OH are also seen in the LMC, and seem to\noriginate from photodissociation regions more extended in peripheries of\nmolecular clouds due to the lower metallicity condition.\n", "  At present there are many studies concerning jets towards low-mass young\nstellar objects, while equivalent studies towards massive or intermediate-mass\nyoung stellar objects are scarce. In a previous study, we found highly\nmisaligned molecular outflows towards the infrared point source IRS. Using\nnear-IR data acquired with Gemini-NIRI at the JHKs-broad-bands and narrow-bands\ncentered at the emission lines of [FeII], H2 1-0 S(1), H2 2-1 S(1), Br-gamma,\nand CO 2-0 (bh), we studied the circumstellar environment of IRS with an\nangular resolution between 0.35\" and 0.45\". The emission in the\nJHKs-broad-bands shows, with great detail, the presence of a cone-like shape\nnebula extending to the north/northeast of the point source, which appears to\nbe attached to it by a jet-like structure. In the three bands the nebula is\nresolved in a twisted-shaped feature composed by two arc-like features and a\nbow shock-like structure seen mainly in the Ks-band, which strongly suggests\nthe presence of a precessing jet. An analysis of proper motions based on our\nGemini observations and UKIDSS data gives additional support to the precession\nscenario. We are presenting one of the best resolved cone-like nebula likely\nrelated to a precessing jet up to date. The analysis of the observed\nnear-infrared lines shows that the H2 is collisionally excited, and the\nspatially coincidence of the [FeII] and H2 emissions in the closer arc-like\nfeature suggests that this region is affected by a J-shock. The second arc-like\nfeature presents H2 emission without [FeII] which suggests the presence of a\nnondisociative C-shock or a less energetic J-shock. The H2 1-0 S(1) continuum\nsubtracted image, reveals several knots and filaments at a larger spatial scale\naround IRS, in perfect matching with the distribution of the red and\nblueshifted molecular outflows discovered in our previous work.\n", "  We study thermal effects on a decay process of a false vacuum in type IIA\nstring theory. At finite temperature, the potential of the theory is corrected\nand also thermally excited modes enhance the decay rate. The false vacuum can\naccommodate a string-like object. This cosmic string makes the bubble creation\nrate much larger and causes an inhomogeneous vacuum decay. We investigate\nthermal corrections to the DBI action for the bubble/string bound state and\ndiscuss a thermally assisted tunneling process. We show that thermally excited\nstates enhance the tunneling rate of the decay process, which makes the\nlife-time of the false vacuum much shorter.\n", "  The magnetic dipole radiation (MDR) model is currently the best approach we\nhave to explain pulsar radiation. However a most characteristic parameter of\nthe observed radiation, the braking index n$_{\\rm obs}$ shows deviations for\nall the eight best studied isolated pulsars, from the simple model prediction\nn$_{\\rm dip}$ = 3. The index depends upon the rotational frequency and its\nfirst and second time derivatives, but also on the assumption of that the\nmagnetic dipole moment and inclination angle, and the moment of inertia of the\npulsar are constant in time. In a recent paper [Phys. Rev. D 91, 063007 (2015)]\nwe showed conclusively that changes in the moment of inertia with frequency\nalone, cannot explain the observed braking indices.\n  Possible observational evidence for the magnetic dipole moment migrating away\nfrom the rotational axis at a rate $\\dot\\alpha$ $\\sim$ 0.6$^{\\circ}$ per 100\nyears over the life time of the Crab pulsar has been recently suggested by Lyne\net al. In this paper, we explore the MDR model with constant moment of inertia\nand magnetic dipole moment but variable inclination angle $\\alpha$. We first\ndiscuss the effect of the variation of $\\alpha$ on the observed braking indices\nand show they all can be understood. However, no explanation for the origin of\nthe change in $\\alpha$ is provided.\n  After discussion of the possible source(s) of magnetism in pulsars we propose\na simple mechanism for the change in $\\alpha$ based on a toy model in which the\nmagnetic structure in pulsars consists of two interacting dipoles. We show that\nsuch a system can explain the Crab observation and the measured braking\nindices.\n", "  The entanglement between two bosons or fermions can be accessed if there\nexists an auxiliary degree of freedom which can be used to label and\neffectively distinguish the two particles. For some types of entanglement\nbetween two indistinguishable particles one can observe duality, i.e., if the\nentanglement is present in the Hilbert space H and an auxiliary Hilbert space\nH' is used to label the particles, then if we used H as a label the\nentanglement would be present in H'. For distinguishable particles this effect\ndoes not occur because of superselection rules which prevent superpositions of\ndifferent types of particles. However, it is known that superselection rules\ncan be bypassed if one uses special auxiliary states that are known as\nreference frames. Here we study properties of reference frames which allow for\nan observation of a duality in entanglement between two distinguishable\nparticles. Finally, we discuss the consequences of this result from the\nresource-theoretic point of view.\n", "  Improving students' understanding of the nature of experimental physics is\noften an explicit or implicit goal of undergraduate laboratory physics courses.\nHowever, lab activities in traditional lab courses are typically characterized\nby highly structured, guided labs that often do not require or encourage\nstudents to engage authentically in the process of experimental physics.\nAlternatively, open-ended laboratory activities can provide a more authentic\nlearning environment by, for example, allowing students to exercise greater\nautonomy in what and how physical phenomena are investigated. Engaging in\nauthentic practices may be a critical part of improving students' beliefs\naround the nature of experimental physics. Here, we investigate the impact of\nopen-ended activities in undergraduate lab courses on students' epistemologies\nand expectations about the nature of experimental physics, as well as their\nconfidence and affect, as measured by the Colorado Learning Attitudes about\nScience Survey for Experimental Physics (E-CLASS). Using a national data set of\nstudent responses to the E-CLASS, we find that the inclusion of some open-ended\nlab activities in a lab course correlates with more expert-like postinstruction\nresponses relative to courses that include only traditional guided lab\nactivities. This finding holds when examining postinstruction E-CLASS scores\nwhile controlling for the variance associated with preinstruction scores,\ncourse level, student major, and student gender.\n", "  The phase structure and the infrared behaviour of the Euclidean 3-dimensional\n$O(2)$ symmetric ghost scalar field $\\phi$ has been investigated in Wegner and\nHoughton's renormalization group framework, including higher-derivatives in the\nkinetic term. It is pointed out that higher-derivative coupling provides three\nphases and leads to a triple point in that RG scheme. The types of the phase\ntransitions have also been identified.\n", "  The sample of 379 extragalactic sources is presented that have mid-infrared,\nhigh resolution spectroscopy with the Spitzer Infrared Spectrograph (IRS) and\nalso spectroscopy of the [CII] 158 um line with the Herschel Photodetector\nArray Camera and Spectrometer (PACS). The emission line profiles of [NeII]\n12.81 um, [NeIII] 15.55 um, and [CII] 158 um are presented, and intrinsic line\nwidths are determined (full width half maximum of Gaussian profiles after\ninstrumental correction). All line profiles together with overlays comparing\npositions of PACS and IRS observations are made available in the Cornell Atlas\nof Spitzer IRS Sources (CASSIS). Sources are classified from AGN to starburst\nbased on equivalent widths of the 6.2 um polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon\nfeature. It is found that intrinsic line widths do not change among\nclassification for [CII], with median widths of 207 km per s for AGN, 248 km\nper s for composites, and 233 km per s for starbursts. The [NeII] line widths\nalso do not change with classification, but [NeIII] lines are progressively\nbroader from starburst to AGN. A small number of objects with unusually broad\nlines or unusual redshift differences in any feature are identified.\n", "  Motivated by experiments performed by Landig et al. [Nature 532, 476-479], we\nconsider a two dimensional Bose gas in an optical lattice, trapped inside a\nsingle mode superradiant Fabry Perot cavity. The cavity mediates infinite range\ncheckerboard interactions between the atoms, which produces competition between\nMott insulator, charge density wave, superfluid and supersolid phases. We\ncalculate the phase diagram of this Bose gas in a homogeneous system and in the\npresence of a harmonic trap.\n", "  White dwarfs are the final remnants of low- and intermediate-mass stars.\nTheir evolution is essentially a cooling process that lasts for $\\sim 10$ Gyr.\nTheir observed properties provide information about the history of the Galaxy,\nits dark matter content and a host of other interesting astrophysical problems.\nExamples of these include an independent determination of the past history of\nthe local star formation rate, identification of the objects responsible for\nthe reported microlensing events, constraints on the rate of change of the\ngravitational constant, and upper limits to the mass of weakly interacting\nmassive particles. To carry on these tasks the essential observational tools\nare the luminosity and mass functions of white dwarfs, whereas the theoretical\ntools are the evolutionary sequences of white dwarf progenitors, and the\ncorresponding white dwarf cooling sequences. In particular, the observed white\ndwarf luminosity function is the key manifestation of the white dwarf cooling\ntheory, although other relevant ingredients are needed to compare theory and\nobservations. In this review we summarize the recent attempts to empirically\ndetermine the white dwarf luminosity function for the different Galactic\npopulations. We also discuss the biases that may affect its interpretation.\nFinally, we elaborate on the theoretical ingredients needed to model the white\ndwarf luminosity function, paying special attention to the remaining\nuncertainties, and we comment on some applications of the white dwarf cooling\ntheory. Astrophysical problems for which white dwarf stars may provide useful\nleverage in the near future are also discussed.\n", "  Context: [abbreviated]\n  Aims: Kepler data of three known Be stars are re-visited to establish their\npulsational nature and assess the properties of additional, non-pulsational\nvariations. The three program stars turned out to be one inactive Be star, one\nactive, continuously outbursting Be star, and one Be star transiting from a\nnon-outbursting into an outbursting phase, thus forming an excellent sample to\ndistill properties of Be stars in the various phases of their life-cycle.\n  Methods: [abbreviated]\n  Results: The short-term photometric variability of Be stars must be\ndisentangled into a stellar and a circumstellar part. The stellar part is on\nthe whole not different from what is seen in non-Be stars. However, some of the\nobserved phenomena might be to be due to resonant mode coupling, a mechanism\nnot typically considered for B-type stars. Short-term circumstellar variability\ncomes in the form of either a group of relatively well-defined, short-lived\nfrequencies during outbursts, which are called \\v{S}tefl frequencies, and broad\nbumps in the power spectra, indicating aperiodic variability on a time scale\nsimilar to typical low-order $g$-mode pulsation frequencies, rather than true\nperiodicity.\n  Conclusions: From a stellar pulsation perspective, Be stars are rapidly\nrotating SPB stars, that is they pulsate in low order $g$-modes, even if the\nrapid rotation can project the observed frequencies into the traditional\nhigh-order $p$-mode regime above about 4 c/d. However, when a circumstellar\ndisk is present, Be star power spectra are complicated by both cyclic, or\nperiodic, and aperiodic circumstellar phenomena, possibly even dominating the\npower spectrum.\n", "  We study the $\\rho\\pi$ and $b_1\\pi$ decay modes of the $1^{-+}$ light hybrid\nstate within the framework of light-cone QCD sum rules. We use both the tensor\ncurrent $\\bar\\psi\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\psi$ and the derivative current\n$\\bar{\\psi}\\overleftrightarrow{D}_\\mu\\gamma_5\\psi$ as interpolating currents to\ncalculate the partial decay width of the $b_1\\pi$ decay mode. Comparing the sum\nrules obtained by using different currents, we obtain $\\Gamma(\\pi_1\\to b_1\\pi)$\n= 8--23, 32--86 and 52--151\\,MeV for $m_{1^{-+}}$ = 1.6, 1.8 and 2.0\\,GeV\nrespectively, which favour the results from the flux tube models and lattice\nsimulations. We also use the tensor current to study the $\\rho\\pi$ decay mode,\nand although an extended stability criterion is needed, our results suggest a\nsmall partial decay width.\n", "  Time-resolved femtosecond x-ray diffraction patterns from laser-excited\nmolecular iodine are used to create a movie of intramolecular motion with time\nand space resolution of $30~$fs and $0.3$ \\AA . The high spatial fidelity is\ndue to interference between the moving excitation and the static initial charge\ndistribution. This x-ray interference has not been employed to image internal\nmotion in molecules before. The initial state is used as the local oscillator\nfor heterodyne amplification of the excited charge distribution to retrieve\nreal-space movies of atomic motion on \\AA ngstrom and femtosecond scales.\nCoherent vibrational motion and dispersion, dissociation, and rotational\ndephasing are all clearly visible in the data, thereby demonstrating the\nstunning sensitivity of heterodyne methods.\n", "  Spiral structures are a common feature in scattered-light images of\nprotoplanetary disks, and of great interest as possible tracers of the presence\nof planets. However, other mechanisms have been put foward to explain them,\nincluding self-gravity, disk-envelope interactions, and dead zone boundaries.\nThese mechanisms explain many spirals very well, but are unable to easily\naccount for very loosely wound spirals and single spiral arms. We study the\neffect of light travel time on the shape of a shadow cast by a clump orbiting\nclose (within ${\\sim}1\\,$au) of the central star, where there can be\nsignificant orbital motion during the light travel time from the clump to the\nouter disk and then to the sky plane. This delay in light rays reaching the sky\nplane gives rise to a variety of spiral- and arc-shaped shadows, which we\ndescribe with a general fitting formula for a flared, inclined disk.\n", "  Models of core-collapse supernova explosions powered by the neutrino-driven\nmechanism have matured considerable in recent years. Explosions at the low-mass\nend of the progenitor spectrum can routinely be simulated in 1D, 2D, and 3D and\nallow us to study supernova nucleosynthesis based on first-principle models.\nResults of nucleosynthesis calculations indicate that supernovae of the lowest\nmasses could be important contributors of some lighter n-rich elements beyond\niron. The explosion mechanism of more massive stars is still under\ninvestigation, although first 3D models of neutrino-driven explosions employing\nmulti-group neutrino transport have recently become available. Together with\nearlier 2D models and more simplified 3D simulations, these have elucidated the\ninterplay between neutrino heating and hydrodynamic instabilities in the\npost-shock region that is essential for shock revival. However, some physical\ningredients may still need to be added or improved before simulations can\nrobustly explain supernova explosions over a wide mass range. We explore\npossible issues that may affect the accuracy of supernova simulations, and\nreview some of the ideas that have recently been explored as avenues to robust\nexplosions, including uncertainties in the neutrino rates, rapid rotation, and\nan external forcing of non-radial fluid motions by strong seed perturbations\nfrom convective shell burning. The perturbation-aided neutrino-driven mechanism\nand the implications of recent 3D simulations of shell burning in supernova\nprogenitors are discussed in detail. The efficacy of the perturbation-aided\nmechanism is illustrated by the first successful multi-group neutrino\nhydrodynamics simulation of an 18 solar mass progenitor with 3D initial\nconditions. We conclude with speculations about the potential impact of 3D\neffects on the structure of massive stars through convective boundary mixing.\n(abridged)\n", "  We present an analytical approach for the equilibrium of a self-gravitating\ncharged fluid embedded in a spherical gravitational and dipolar magnetic fields\nproduced by a central mass. Our scheme is proposed, as a toy-model, in the\ncontext of gaseous/dusty tori surrounding supermassive black holes in galactic\nnuclei. While the central black hole dominates the gravitational field and it\nremains electrically neutral, the surrounding material has a non-negligible\nself-gravitational effect on the torus structure. By charging mechanisms it\nalso acquires non-zero electric charge density, so the two influences need to\nbe taken into account to achieve a self-consistent picture. With our approach\nwe discuss the impact of self-gravity, represented by the term dt (ratio of the\ntorus total mass to the mass of the central body), on the conditions for\nexistence of the equilibrium and the morphology and typology of the tori. By\ncomparison with a previous work without self-gravity, we show that the\nconditions can be different. Although the main aim of the present paper is to\ndiscuss a framework for the classification of electrically charged, magnetized,\nself-gravitating tori, we also mention potential astrophysical applications to\nvertically stratified fluid configurations.\n", "  A stochastic representation of the dynamics of open quantum systems, suitable\nfor non-perturbative system-reservoir interaction, non-Markovian effects and\narbitrarily driven systems is presented. It includes the case of driving on\ntimescales comparable to or shorter than the reservoir correlation time, a\nnotoriously difficult but relevant case in the context of quantum information\nprocessing and quantum thermodynamics. A previous stochastic approach is\nre-formulated for the case of finite reservoir correlation and response times,\nresulting in a numerical simulation strategy exceeding previous ones by orders\nof magnitude in efficiency. Although the approach is based on a memory\nformalism, the dynamical equations propagated in the simulations are\ntime-local. This leaves a wide range of choices in selecting the system to be\nstudied and the numerical method used for propagation. For a series of tests,\nthe dynamics of the spin-boson system is computed in various settings including\nstrong external driving and Landau-Zener transitions.\n", "  The paradigm of layered networks is used to describe many real-world systems\n-- from biological networks, to social organizations and transportation\nsystems. Recently there has been much progress in understanding the general\nproperties of multilayer networks, our understanding of how to control such\nsystems remains limited. One aspect that makes this endeavor challenging is\nthat each layer can operate at a different timescale, thus we cannot directly\napply standard ideas from structural control theory of individual networks.\nHere we address the problem of controlling multilayer and multi-timescale\nnetworks focusing on two-layer multiplex networks with one-to-one interlayer\ncoupling. We investigate the case when the control signal is applied to the\nnodes of one layer. We develop a theory based on disjoint path covers to\ndetermine the minimum number of inputs ($N_\\T i$) necessary for full control.\nWe show that if both layers operate on the same timescale then the network\nstructure of both layers equally affect controllability. In the presence of\ntimescale separation, controllability is enhanced if the controller interacts\nwith the faster layer: $N_\\T i$ decreases as the timescale difference increases\nup to a critical timescale difference, above which $N_\\T i$ remains constant\nand is completely determined by the faster layer. In contrast, control becomes\nincreasingly difficult if the controller interacts with the layer operating on\nthe slower timescale and increasing timescale separation leads to increased\n$N_\\T i$, again up to a critical value, above which $N_\\T i$ still depends on\nthe structure of both layers. By identifying the underlying mechanisms that\nconnect timescale difference and controllability for a simplified model, we\nprovide insight into disentangling how our ability to control real interacting\ncomplex systems is affected by a variety of sources of complexity.\n", "  As an extension to our previous work, we study the transport properties of\nthe Witten-Sakai-Sugimoto model in the black D4-brane background with smeared\nD0-branes (D0-D4/D8 system). Because of the presence of the D0-branes, in the\nbubble configuration this model is holographically dual to 4d QCD or Yang-Mills\ntheory with a Chern-Simons term. And the number density of the D0-branes\ncorresponds to the coupling constant ($\\theta$ angle) of the Chern-Simons term\nin the dual field theory. In this paper, we accordingly focus on small number\ndensity of the D0-branes to study the sound mode in the black D0-D4 brane\nsystem since the coupling of the Chern-Simons term should be quite weak in QCD.\nThen we derive its 5d effective theory and analytically compute the speed of\nsound and the sound wave attenuation in the approach of Gauge/Gravity duality.\nOur result shows the speed of sound and the sound wave attenuation is modified\nby the presence of the D0-branes. Thus they depend on the $\\theta$ angle or\nchiral potential in this holographic description.\n", "  Single point observations are presented in NH3 (1,1) and (2,2) inversion\ntransitions using the Effelsberg 100 m telescope for a sample of 100 6.7 GHz\nmethanol masers and mapping observations in the 12CO and 13CO (1-0) transitions\nusing the PMO Delingha 13.7 m telescope for 82 sample sources with detected\nammonia. A further 62 sources were selected for either 12CO or 13CO line\noutflow identification, producing 45 outflow candidates, 29 using 12CO and 16\nusing 13CO data. Twenty-two of the outflow candidates were newly identified,\nand 23 had trigonometric parallax distances. Physical properties were derived\nfrom ammonia lines and CO outflow parameters calculated. Histograms and\nstatistical correlations for ammonia, CO outflow parameters, and 6.7 GHz\nmethanol maser luminosities are also presented. No significant correlation was\nfound between ammonia and maser luminosity. However, weak correlations were\nfound between outflow properties and maser luminosities, which may indicate\nthat outflows are physically associated with 6.7 GHz masers.\n", "  Radiation feedback from stellar clusters is expected to play a key role in\nsetting the rate and efficiency of star formation in giant molecular clouds\n(GMCs). To investigate how radiation forces influence realistic turbulent\nsystems, we have conducted a series of numerical simulations employing the {\\it\nHyperion} radiation hydrodynamics solver, considering the regime that is\noptically thick to ultraviolet (UV) and optically thin to infrared (IR)\nradiation. Our model clouds cover initial surface densities between\n$\\Sigma_{\\rm cl,0} \\sim 10-300~M_{\\odot}~{\\rm pc^{-2}}$, with varying initial\nturbulence. We follow them through turbulent, self-gravitating collapse,\nformation of star clusters, and cloud dispersal by stellar radiation. All our\nmodels display a lognormal distribution of gas surface density $\\Sigma$; for an\ninitial virial parameter $\\alpha_{\\rm vir,0} = 2$, the lognormal standard\ndeviation is $\\sigma_{\\rm ln \\Sigma} = 1-1.5$ and the star formation rate\ncoefficient $\\varepsilon_{\\rm ff,\\bar\\rho} = 0.3-0.5$, both of which are\nsensitive to turbulence but not radiation feedback. The net star formation\nefficiency $\\varepsilon_\\mathrm{final}$ increases with $\\Sigma_{\\rm cl,0}$ and\ndecreases with $\\alpha_{\\rm vir,0}$. We interpret these results via a simple\nconceptual framework, whereby steady star formation increases the radiation\nforce, such that local gas patches at successively higher $\\Sigma$ become\nunbound. Based on this formalism (with fixed $\\sigma_{\\rm ln \\Sigma}$), we\nprovide an analytic upper bound on $\\varepsilon_\\mathrm{final}$, which is in\ngood agreement with our numerical results. The final star formation efficiency\ndepends on the distribution of Eddington ratios in the cloud and is strongly\nincreased by turbulent compression of gas.\n", "  Various small-scale structures abound in the solar atmosphere above active\nregions, playing an important role in the dynamics and evolution therein. We\nreport on a new class of small-scale transition region structures in active\nregions, characterized by strong emissions but extremely narrow Si IV line\nprofiles as found in observations taken with the Interface Region Imaging\nSpectrograph (IRIS). Tentatively named as Narrow-line-width UV bursts (NUBs),\nthese structures are located above sunspots and comprise of one or multiple\ncompact bright cores at sub-arcsecond scales. We found six NUBs in two datasets\n(a raster and a sit-and-stare dataset). Among these, four events are\nshort-living with a duration of $\\sim$10 mins while two last for more than 36\nmins. All NUBs have Doppler shifts of 15--18 km/s, while the NUB found in\nsit-and-stare data possesses an additional component at $\\sim$50 km/s found\nonly in the C II and Mg II lines. Given that these events are found to play a\nrole in the local dynamics, it is important to further investigate the physical\nmechanisms that generate these phenomena and their role in the mass transport\nin sunspots.\n", "  Wave propagation through sunspots involves conversion between waves of\nacoustic and magnetic character. In addition, the thermal structure of sunspots\nis very different than that of the quiet Sun. As a consequence, the\ninterpretation of local helioseismic measurements of sunspots has long been a\nchallenge. With the aim of understanding these measurements, we carry out\nnumerical simulations of wave propagation through sunspots. Helioseismic\nholography measurements made from the resulting simulated wavefields show\nqualitative agreement with observations of real sunspots. We use additional\nnumerical experiments to determine, separately, the influence of the thermal\nstructure of the sunspot and the direct effect of the sunspot magnetic field.\nWe use the ray approximation to show that the travel-time shifts in the thermal\n(non-magnetic) sunspot model are primarily produced by changes in the wave path\ndue to the Wilson depression rather than variations in the wave speed. This\nshows that inversions for the subsurface structure of sunspots must account for\nlocal changes in the density. In some ranges of horizontal phase speed and\nfrequency there is agreement (within the noise level in the simulations)\nbetween the travel times measured in the full magnetic sunspot model and the\nthermal model. If this conclusion proves to be robust for a wide range of\nmodels, it would suggest a path towards inversions for sunspot structure.\n", "  In this article the neutrino-pair production from nucleon-nucleon (NN)\nbremsstrahlung is explored via medium-modifications of the strong interactions\nat the level of the one-pion exchange approximation. It governs the bulk part\nof the NN interaction at low densities relevant for the neutrino physics in\ncore-collapse supernova studies. The resulting medium modified one-pion\nexchange rate for the neutrino-pair processes is implemented in simulations of\ncore collapse supernovae in order to study the impact on the neutrino signal\nemitted from the deleptonization of the nascent proto-neutron star.\nConsequences for the nucleosynthesis of heavy elements of the material ejected\nfrom the PNS surface are discussed.\n", "  The accretion of interstellar medium onto the central super massive black\nholes is widely accepted as the source of the gigantic energy released by the\nactive galactic nuclei. But few pieces of observational evidence have been\nconfirmed directly demonstrating the existence of the inflows. The absorption\nline system in the spectra of quasar SDSS J112526.12+002901.3 presents an\ninteresting example, in which the rarely detected hydrogen Balmer and\nmetastable He I absorption lines are found redshifted to the quasar's rest\nframe along with the low-ionization metal absorption lines Mg II, Fe II, etc.\nThe repeated SDSS spectroscopic observations suggest a transverse velocity\nsmaller than the radial velocity. The motion of the absorbing medium is thus\ndominated by infall. The He I* lines present a powerful probe to the strength\nof ionizing flux, while the Balmer lines imply a dense environment. With the\nhelp of photoionization simulations, we find the absorbing medium is exposed to\nthe radiation with ionization parameter $U\\approx 10^{-1.8}$, and the density\nis $n(\\mathrm{H})\\approx 10^9\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$. Thus the absorbing medium is\nlocated $\\sim 4\\ \\mathrm{pc}$ away from the central engine. According to the\nsimilarity in the distance and physical conditions between the absorbing medium\nand the torus, we strongly propose the absorption line system as a candidate\nfor the accretion inflow which originates from the inner surface of the torus.\n", "  A compound with very weakly interacting chains, MnCl$_3$(bpy), has attracted\na great deal of attention as a possible $S=2$ Haldane chain. However,\nlong-range magnetic order of the chains prevents the Haldane gap from\ndeveloping below 11.5~K. Based on a four-sublattice model, a description of the\nantiferromagnetic resonance (AFMR) spectrum up to frequencies of 1.5~THz and\nmagnetic fields up to 50~T indicates that the interchain coupling is indeed\nquite small but that the Dzaloshinskii-Moriya interaction produced by broken\ninversion symmetry is substantial (0.12~meV). In addition, the\nantiferromagnetic, nearest-neighbor interaction within each chain (3.3~meV) is\nsignificantly stronger than previously reported. The excitation spectrum of\nthis $S=2$ compound is well-described by a $1/S$ expansion about the classical\nlimit.\n", "  Solar flares produce radiation which can have an almost immediate effect on\nthe near-Earth environment, making it crucial to forecast flares in order to\nmitigate their negative effects. The number of published approaches to flare\nforecasting using photospheric magnetic field observations has proliferated,\nwith varying claims about how well each works. Because of the different\nanalysis techniques and data sets used, it is essentially impossible to compare\nthe results from the literature. This problem is exacerbated by the low event\nrates of large solar flares. The challenges of forecasting rare events have\nlong been recognized in the meteorology community, but have yet to be fully\nacknowledged by the space weather community. During the interagency workshop on\n\"all clear\" forecasts held in Boulder, CO in 2009, the performance of a number\nof existing algorithms was compared on common data sets, specifically\nline-of-sight magnetic field and continuum intensity images from MDI, with\nconsistent definitions of what constitutes an event. We demonstrate the\nimportance of making such systematic comparisons, and of using standard\nverification statistics to determine what constitutes a good prediction scheme.\nWhen a comparison was made in this fashion, no one method clearly outperformed\nall others, which may in part be due to the strong correlations among the\nparameters used by different methods to characterize an active region. For\nM-class flares and above, the set of methods tends towards a weakly positive\nskill score (as measured with several distinct metrics), with no participating\nmethod proving substantially better than climatological forecasts.\n", "  There is a long way from `accuracy' to `precision' about {\\bf CP} asymmetries\nin the decays of beauty \\& charm hadrons. (a) We have to apply consistent\nparametrization of the CKM matrix. (b) Probing many-body final states (FS) is\n{\\em not} a back-up for understanding the underlying forces; to be realistic we\ncan hardly go beyond four-body FS. (c) Broken U-spin symmetry is a good tools\nto describe spectroscopy of hadrons.However the landscape is very different for\nweak transitions; the connection of U- \\& V-spin symmetries are important.

The chiral exotic partners with good\nparity formed using the $(0^+, 1^+)$ multiplet are about twice more bound than\ntheir primary exotic partners formed using the $(0^-,1^-)$ multiplet. The\nchiral couplings across the multiplets $(0^\\pm, 1^\\pm)$ cause the chiral exotic\npartners to unbind, and the primary exotic molecules to be about twice more\nbound, for $J\\leq 1$. Our multi-channel coupling results show that only the\ncharm isosinglet exotic molecules with $J^{PC}=1^{++}$ binds, which we identify\nas the reported neutral $X(3872)$. Also, the bottom isotriplet exotic with\n$J^{PC}=1^{+-}$ binds, which we identify as a mixture of the reported charged\nexotics $Z^+_b(10610)$ and $Z^+_b(10650)$. The bound isosinglet with\n$J^{PC}=1^{++}$ is suggested as a possible neutral $X_b(10532)$ not yet\nreported.\n", "  Friedel's law states that the modulus of the Fourier transform of real\nfunctions is centrosymmetric, while the phase is antisymmetric. As a\nconsequence of this, elastic scattering of plane wave photons or electrons\nwithin the first-order Born-approximation as well as Fraunhofer diffraction on\nany aperture, is bound to result in centrosymmetric diffraction patterns.\nFriedel's law, however, does not apply for vortex beams, and centrosymmetry in\ngeneral is not present in their diffraction patterns. In this work we extend\nFriedel's law for vortex beams by showing that the diffraction patterns of\nvortex beams with opposite topological charge, scattered on the same two\ndimensional potential, always are centrosymmetric to one another, regardless of\nthe symmetry of the scattering object. We verify our statement by means of\nnumerical simulations and experimental data. Our research provides deeper\nunderstanding in vortex beam diffraction and can be used to design new\nexperiments to measure the topological charge of vortex beams with diffraction\ngratings, or study general vortex beam diffraction.\n", "  Gamma-ray binaries consist of a neutron star or a black hole interacting with\na normal star to produce gamma-ray emission that dominates the radiative output\nof the system. Only a handful of such systems have been previously discovered,\nall within our Galaxy. Here we report the discovery with the Fermi Large Area\nTelescope (LAT) of a luminous gamma-ray binary in the Large Magellanic Cloud\nfrom a search for periodic modulation in all sources in the third Fermi LAT\ncatalog. This is the first such system to be found outside the Milky Way. The\nsystem has an orbital period of 10.3 days and is associated with a massive\nO5III star located in the supernova remnant DEM L241, previously identified as\nthe candidate high-mass X-ray binary (HMXB) CXOU J053600.0-673507. X-ray and\nradio emission are also modulated on the 10.3 day period, but are in anti-phase\nwith the gamma-ray modulation. Optical radial velocity measurements suggest\nthat the system contains a neutron star. The source is significantly more\nluminous than similar sources in the Milky Way at radio, optical, X-ray and\ngamma-ray wavelengths. The detection of this extra-galactic system, but no new\nGalactic systems raises the possibility that the predicted number of gamma-ray\nbinaries in our Galaxy has been overestimated, and that HMXBs may be born\ncontaining relatively slowly rotating neutron stars.\n", "  We present a study of white light flares from the active M5.5 dwarf Proxima\nCentauri using the Canadian microsatellite MOST. Using 37.6 days of monitoring\ndata from 2014 and 2015, we have detected 66 individual flare events, the\nlargest number of white light flares observed to date on Proxima Cen. Flare\nenergies in our sample range from $10^{29}$-$10^{31.5}$ erg. The flare rate is\nlower than that of other classic flare stars of similar spectral type, such as\nUV Ceti, which may indicate Proxima Cen had a higher flare rate in its youth.\nProxima Cen does have an unusually high flare rate given its slow rotation\nperiod, however. Extending the observed power-law occurrence distribution down\nto $10^{28}$ erg, we show that flares with flux amplitudes of 0.5% occur 63\ntimes per day, while superflares with energies of $10^{33}$ erg occur ~8 times\nper year. Small flares may therefore pose a great difficulty in searches for\ntransits from the recently announced 1.27 M_earth Proxima b, while frequent\nlarge flares could have significant impact on the planetary atmosphere.\n", "  We present the results of near-infrared (2.5--5.4um) long-slit spectroscopy\nof the extended green object (EGO) G318.05+0.09 with AKARI. Two distinct\nsources are found in the slit. The brighter source has strong red continuum\nemission with H2O ice, CO2 ice, and CO gas and ice absorption features at 3.0,\n4.25um, 4.67um, respectively, while the other greenish object shows peculiar\nemission that has double peaks at around 4.5 and 4.7um. The former source is\nlocated close to the ultra compact HII region IRAS 14498-5856 and is identified\nas an embedded massive young stellar object. The spectrum of the latter source\ncan be interpreted by blue-shifted (-3000 ~ -6000km/s) optically-thin emission\nof the fundamental ro-vibrational transitions (v=1-0) of CO molecules with\ntemperatures of 12000--3700K without noticeable H2 and HI emission. We discuss\nthe nature of this source in terms of outflow associated with the young stellar\nobject and supernova ejecta associated with a supernova remnant.\n", "  Extended MHD is a one-fluid model that incorporates two-fluid effects such as\nelectron inertia and the Hall drift. This model is used to construct fully\nnonlinear Alfv\\'enic wave solutions, and thereby derive the kinetic and\nmagnetic spectra by resorting to a Kolmogorov-like hypothesis based on the\nconstant cascading rates of the energy and generalized helicities of this\nmodel. The magnetic and kinetic spectra are derived in the ideal $\\left(k <\n1/\\lambda_i\\right)$, Hall $\\left(1/\\lambda_i < k < 1/\\lambda_e \\right)$, and\nelectron inertia $\\left(k > 1/\\lambda_e\\right)$ regimes; $k$ is the wavenumber\nand $\\lambda_s = c/\\omega_{p s}$ is the skin depth of species `$s$'. In the\nHall regime, it is shown that the emergent results are fully consistent with\nprevious numerical and analytical studies, especially in the context of the\nsolar wind. The focus is primarily on the electron inertia regime, where\nmagnetic energy spectra with power-law indexes of $-11/3$ and $-13/3$ are\nalways recovered. The latter, in particular, is quite close to recent\nobservational evidence from the solar wind with a potential slope of\napproximately $-4$ in this regime. It is thus plausible that these spectra may\nconstitute a part of the (extended) inertial range, as opposed to the standard\n`dissipation' range paradigm.\n", "  We investigate the pulse partitioning of a 6.3 mJ, 450 fs pulse at 1030 nm to\nproduce plasma channels. At such moderate energies, splitting the energy into\nseveral sub-pulses reduces the ionization efficiency and thus does not extend\nthe plasma lifetime. We numerically show that when sufficient energy to produce\nmultifilamentation is available, splitting the pulse temporally in a pulse\ntrain increases the gas temperature compared to a filament bundle of the same\nenergy. This could improve the mean free path of the free electrons, therefore\nenhancing the efficiency of discharge triggering.\n", "  When neutron stars (NS) accrete gas from low-mass binary companions,\nexplosive nuclear burning reactions in the NS envelope fuse hydrogen and helium\ninto heavier elements. The resulting thermonuclear (type-I) X-ray bursts\nproduce energy spectra that are fit well with black bodies, but a significant\nnumber of burst observations show deviations from Planck spectra. Here we\npresent our analysis of RXTE/PCA observations of X-ray bursts from the NS\nlow-mass X-ray binary HETE J1900.1-2455. We have discovered that the\nnon-Planckian spectra are caused by photo-ionization edges. The\nanti-correlation between the strength of the edges and the colour temperature\nsuggests that the edges are produced by the nuclear burning ashes that have\nbeen transported upwards by convection and become exposed at the photosphere.\nThe atmosphere model fits show that occasionally the photosphere can consist\nentirely of metals, and that the peculiar changes in black body temperature and\nradius can be attributed to the emergence and disappearance of metals in the\nphotosphere. As the metals are detected already in the Eddington-limited phase,\nit is possible that a radiatively driven wind ejects some of the burning ashes\ninto the interstellar space.\n", "  The level of random motions in the intracluster gas lying between 20 and 60\nkpc radius in the core of the Perseus cluster has been measured by the Hitomi\nSoft X-ray Spectrometer at 164 +/- 10 km/s. The maximum energy density in\nturbulent motions on that scale is therefore low. If dissipated as heat the\nturbulent energy will be radiated away in less than 80 Myr and cannot spread\nacross the core. A higher velocity is needed to prevent a cooling collapse.\nGravity waves are shown to travel too slowly in a radial direction. Here we\ninvestigate propagation of energy by sound waves. The energy travels at about\n1000 km/s and can cross the core in a cooling time. We show that the\ndisplacement velocity amplitude of the gas required to carry the power is\nconsistent with the Hitomi result and that the inferred density and temperature\nvariations are consistent with Chandra observations.\n", "  Two energetic hard X-ray bursts have recently triggered the Fermi and Swift\nspace observatories from the rotation powered pulsar, PSR J1119-6127. We have\nperformed in depth spectral and temporal analyses of these two events. Our\nextensive searches in both observatory data for lower luminosity bursts\nuncovered 10 additional events from the source. We report here on the timing\nand energetics of the 12 bursts from PSR J1119-6127 during its burst active\nphase of 2016 July 26 and 28. We also found a spectral softer X-ray flux\nenhancement in a post burst episode, which shows evidence of cooling. We\ndiscuss here the implications of these results on the nature of this unusual\nhigh-field radio pulsar, which firmly place it within the typical magnetar\npopulation.\n", "  We study a generalization of the XY model with an additional nematic-like\nterm through extensive numerical simulations and finite-size techniques, both\nin two and three dimensions. While the original model favors local alignment,\nthe extra term induces angles of $2\\pi/q$ between neighboring spins. We focus\nhere on the $q=8$ case (while presenting new results for other values of $q$ as\nwell) whose phase diagram is much richer than the well known $q=2$ case. In\nparticular, the model presents not only continuous, standard transitions\nbetween Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) phases as in $q=2$, but also\ninfinite order transitions involving intermediate, competition driven phases\nabsent for $q=2$ and 3. Besides presenting multiple transitions, our results\nshow that having vortices decoupling at a transition is not a suficient\ncondition for it to be of BKT type.\n", "  The Milky Way is surrounded by a gravitationally bound gas corona extending\nup to the Galaxy's virial radius. Interactions of cosmic-ray particles with\nthis gas give rise to energetic secondary gamma rays and neutrinos. We present\na quantitative analysis of the neutrino and gamma-ray fluxes from the corona of\nthe Milky Way together with a combined contribution of coronae of other\ngalaxies. The high-energy neutrino flux is insufficient to explain the IceCube\nresults, while the contribution to the FERMI-LAT diffuse gamma-ray flux is not\nnegligible.\n", "  Frequency and transmission spectrum of two-dimensional array of metallic rods\nis investigated numerically. Based on the recent analysis of the band structure\nof two-dimensional photonic crystal with dielectric rods [P. Marko\\v{s}, Phys.\nRev. A 92 043814 (2015)] we identify two types of bands in the frequency\nspectrum: Bragg (P) bands resulting from a periodicity and Fano (F) bands which\narise from Fano resonances associated with each of the cylinders within the\nperiodic structure. It is shown that the existence of Fano band in a certain\nfrequency range is manifested by a Fano resonance in the transmittance. In\nparticular, we re-examine the symmetry properties of the H- polarized band\nstructure in the frequency range where the spectrum consists of the localized\nmodes associated with the single scatterer resonances and we explore process of\nformation of Fano bands by identifying individual terms in the expansion of the\nLCAO states. We demonstrate how the interplay between the two scattering\nmechanisms affects properties of the resulting band structure when the radius\nof cylinders is increased. We show that a different character of both kinds of\nbands is reflected in the spatial distribution of the magnetic field which\ndisplays patterns corresponding to the corresponding irreducible symmetry\nrepresentations.\n", "  The past decade has seen significant progress on the direct detection and\ncharacterization of young, self-luminous giant planets at wide orbital\nseparations from their host stars. Some of these planets show evidence for\ndisequilibrium processes like transport-induced quenching in their atmospheres;\nphotochemistry may also be important, despite the large orbital distances.\nThese disequilibrium chemical processes can alter the expected composition,\nspectral behavior, thermal structure, and cooling history of the planets, and\ncan potentially confuse determinations of bulk elemental ratios, which provide\nimportant insights into planet-formation mechanisms. Using a\nthermo/photochemical kinetics and transport model, we investigate the extent to\nwhich disequilibrium chemistry affects the composition and spectra of directly\nimaged giant exoplanets. Results for specific \"young Jupiters\" such as HR 8799\nb and 51 Eri b are presented, as are general trends as a function of planetary\neffective temperature, surface gravity, incident ultraviolet flux, and strength\nof deep atmospheric convection. We find that quenching is very important on\nyoung Jupiters, leading to CO/CH4 and N2/NH3 ratios much greater than, and H2O\nmixing ratios a factor of a few less than, chemical-equilibrium predictions.\nPhotochemistry can also be important on such planets, with CO2 and HCN being\nkey photochemical products. Carbon dioxide becomes a major constituent when\nstratospheric temperatures are low and recycling of water via the H2 + OH\nreaction becomes kinetically stifled. Young Jupiters with effective\ntemperatures <~ 700 K are in a particularly interesting photochemical regime\nthat differs from both transiting hot Jupiters and our own solar-system giant\nplanets.\n", "  Context. Red-giant stars may engulf planets. This may increase the rotation\nrate of their convective envelope, which could lead to strong dynamo-triggered\nmagnetic fields. Aims. We explore the possibility of generating magnetic fields\nin red giants that have gone through the process of a planet engulfment. We\ncompare them with similar models that evolve without any planets. We discuss\nthe impact of stellar wind magnetic braking on the evolution of the surface\nvelocity of the parent star. Methods. With rotating stellar models with and\nwithout planets and an empirical relation between the Rossby number and the\nsurface magnetic field, we deduce the evolution of the surface magnetic field\nalong the red-giant branch. The effects of wind magnetic braking is explored\nusing a relation deduced from MHD simulations. Results. The stellar evolution\nmodel of a 1.7 M$_\\odot$ without planet engulfment and that has a time-averaged\nrotation velocity during the Main-Sequence equal to 100 km s$^{-1}$, shows a\nsurface magnetic field triggered by convection larger than 10 G only at the\nbase of the red giant branch, that means for gravities log $g > 3$. When a\nplanet engulfment occurs, such magnetic field can also appear at much lower\ngravities, i.e. at much higher luminosities along the red giant branch.\nTypically the engulfment of a 15 M$_J$ planet produces a dynamo triggered\nmagnetic field larger than 10 G for gravities between 2.5 and 1.9. We show that\nfor reasonable wind magnetic braking laws, the high surface velocity reached\nafter a planet engulfment may be maintained sufficiently long for being\nobservable. Conclusions. High surface magnetic fields for red giants in the\nupper part of the red giant branch is a strong indication of a planet\nengulfment or of an interaction with a companion. Our theory can be tested by\nobserving fast rotating red giants and check whether they show magnetic fields.\n", "  The role of compressible fluctuations in the energy cascade of fast solar\nwind turbulence is studied using a reduced form of an exact law derived\nrecently (Banerjee and Galtier, PRE, 2013) for compressible isothermal\nmagnetohydrodynamics and in-situ observations from the THEMIS B/ARTEMIS P1\nspacecraft. A statistical survey of the data revealed a turbulent energy\ncascade over two decades of scales, which is broader than the previous\nestimates made from an exact incompressible law. A term-by-term analysis of the\ncompressible model reveals new insight into the role played by the compressible\nfluctuations in the energy cascade. The compressible fluctuations are shown to\namplify (2 to 4 times) the turbulent cascade rate with respect to the\nincompressible model in 10 % of the analyzed samples. This new estimated\ncascade rate is shown to provide the adequate energy dissipation required.\n", "  We present new high-resolution chemical-abundance analyses for the well-known\nhigh proper-motion subdwarfs G64-12 and G64-37, based on very high\nsignal-to-noise spectra (S/N ~ 700/1) with resolving power R ~ 95,000. These\nhigh-quality data enable the first reliable determination of the carbon\nabundances for these two stars; we classify them as carbon-enhanced metal-poor\n(CEMP) stars based on their carbonicities, which both exceed [C/Fe] = +1.0.\nThey are sub-classified as CEMP- no Group-II stars, based on their location in\nthe Yoon-Beers diagram of absolute carbon abundance, A(C) vs. [Fe/H], as well\nas on the conventional diagnostic [Ba/Fe]. The relatively low absolute carbon\nabundances of CEMP-no stars, in combination with the high effective\ntemperatures of these two stars (Teff ~ 6500 K) weakens their CH molecular\nfeatures to the point that accurate carbon abundances can only be estimated\nfrom spectra with very high S/N. A comparison of the observed abundance\npatterns with the predicted yields from massive, metal-free supernova models\nreduces the inferred progenitor masses by factors of ~ 2-3, and explosion\nenergies by factors of ~ 10-15, compared to those derived using previously\nclaimed carbon abundance estimates. There are certainly many more warm CEMP-no\nstars near the halo main-sequence turnoff that have been overlooked in past\nstudies, directly impacting the derived frequencies of CEMP-no stars as a\nfunction of metallicity, a probe that provides important constraints on\nGalactic chemical evolution models, the initial mass function in the early\nUniverse, and first-star nucleosynthesis.\n", "  What can cells gain by using disordered, rather than folded, proteins in the\narchitecture of their skeleton? Disordered proteins take multiple co-existing\nconformations, and often contain segments which act as random-walk-shaped\npolymers. Using X-ray scattering we measure the compression response of\ndisordered protein hydrogels, which are the main stress-responsive component of\nneuron cells. We find that at high compression their mechanics are dominated by\ngas-like steric and ionic repulsions. At low compression, specific attractive\ninteractions dominate. This is demonstrated by the considerable hydrogel\nexpansion induced by the truncation of critical short protein segments.\nAccordingly, the floppy disordered proteins form a weakly cross-bridged\nhydrogel, and act as shock absorbers that sustain large deformations without\nfailure.\n", "  The recent discovery of gravitational waves from mergers of $\\sim 10 \\,\nM_{\\odot}$ black hole binaries has stimulated interested in Primordial Black\nHole dark matter in this mass range. Microlensing and dynamical constraints\nexclude all of the dark matter being in compact objects with a delta function\nmass function in the range $10^{-7} \\lesssim M/ M_{\\odot} \\lesssim 10^{5}$.\nHowever it has been argued that all of the dark matter could be composed of\ncompact objects in this range with an extended mass function. We explicitly\nrecalculate the microlensing and dynamical constraints for compact objects with\nan extended mass function which replicates the PBH mass function produced by\ninflation models. We find that the microlensing and dynamical constraints place\nconflicting constraints on the width of the mass function, and do not find a\nmass function which satisfies both constraints.\n", "  We present a scheme for joint remote state preparation (JRSP) of\nthree-particle state via three tripartite Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ)\nentangled states as the quantum channel linking the parties. We use eight-qubit\nmutually orthogonal basis vector as measurement point of departure. The\nlikelihood of success for this scheme has been found to be $1/8$. However, by\nputting some special cases into consideration, the chances can be ameliorated\nto $1/4$ and $1$. The effects of amplitude-damping noise, phase-damping noise\nand depolarizing noise on this scheme have been scrutinized and the analytical\nderivations of fidelities for the quantum noisy channels have been presented.\nWe found that for $0.55\\leq\\eta\\leq1$, the states conveyed through depolarizing\nchannel lose more information than phase-damping channel while the information\nloss through amplitude damping channel is most minimal.\n", "  Starting with a bare nucleon-nucleon interaction, for the first time the full\nrelativistic Brueckner-Hartree-Fock equations are solved for finite nuclei in a\nDirac-Woods-Saxon basis. No free parameters are introduced to calculate the\nground-state properties of finite nuclei. The nucleus $^{16}$O is investigated\nas an example. The resulting ground-state properties, such as binding energy\nand charge radius, are considerably improved as compared with the\nnon-relativistic Brueckner-Hartree-Fock results and much closer to the\nexperimental data. This opens the door for \\emph{ab initio} covariant\ninvestigations of heavy nuclei.\n", "  The mean alpha-to-iron abundance ratio ([$\\alpha$/Fe]) of galaxies is\nsensitive to the chemical evolution processes at early time, and it is an\nindicator of star formation timescale ($\\tau_{{\\rm SF}}$). Although the\nphysical reason remains ambiguous, there is a tight relation between\n[$\\alpha$/Fe] and stellar velocity dispersion ($\\sigma$) among massive\nearly-type galaxies (ETGs). However, no work has shown convincing results as to\nhow this relation behaves at low masses. We assemble 15 data sets from the\nliterature and build a large sample that includes 192 nearby low-mass\n($18<\\sigma<80$~\\kms) ETGs. We find that the [$\\alpha$/Fe]-$\\sigma$ relation\ngenerally holds for low-mass ETGs, except in extreme environments.\nSpecifically, in normal galaxy cluster environments, the [$\\alpha$/Fe]-$\\sigma$\nrelation and its intrinsic scatter are, within uncertainties, similar for\nlow-mass and high-mass ETGs. However, in the most massive relaxed galaxy\ncluster in our sample, the zero point of the relation is higher and the\nintrinsic scatter is significantly larger. By contrast, in galaxy groups the\nzero point of the relation offsets in the opposite direction, again with\nsubstantial intrinsic scatter. The elevated [$\\alpha$/Fe] of low-mass ETGs in\nthe densest environments suggests that their star formation was quenched\nearlier than in high-mass ETGs. For the low-mass ETGs in the lowest density\nenvironments, we suggest that their more extended star formation histories\nsuppressed their average [$\\alpha$/Fe]. The large scatter in [$\\alpha$/Fe] may\nreflect stochasticity in the chemical evolution of low-mass galaxies.\n", "  We consider the fact that noticing on the operational meaning of the physical\nconcepts played an impetus role in the appearance of general relativity (GR).\nThus, we have paid more attention to the operational definition of the\ngravitational coupling constant in this theory as a dimensional constant which\nis gained through an experiment. However, as all available experiments just\nprovide the value of this constant locally, this coupling constant can\noperationally be meaningful only in a local area. Regarding this point, to\nobtain an extension of GR for the large scale, we replace it by a conformal\ninvariant model and then, reduce this model to a theory for the cosmological\nscale via breaking down the conformal symmetry through singling out a specific\nconformal frame which is characterized by the large scale characteristics of\nthe universe. Finally, we come to the same field equations that historically\nwere proposed by Einstein for the cosmological scale (GR plus the cosmological\nconstant) as the result of his endeavor for making GR consistent with the Mach\nprinciple. However, we declare that the obtained field equations in this\nalternative approach do~not carry the problem of the field equations proposed\nby Einstein for being consistent with Mach's principle (i.e., the existence of\nde Sitter solution), and can also be considered compatible with this principle\nin the Sciama view.\n", "  Non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) line formation for Ca I-Ca II,\nTi I-Ti II, and Fe I-Fe II is considered in model atmospheres of giant stars\nwith an effective temperature of 4000 K $\\le$ Teff $\\le$ 5000 K and a metal\nabundance of -4 $\\le$ [Fe/H] $\\le$ 0. The departures from LTE are analyzed\ndepending on atmospheric parameters. We present the non-LTE abundance\ncorrections for 28 lines of Ca I, 42 lines of Ti I, 54 lines of Ti II, and 262\nlines of Fe I and a three-dimensional interpolation code to obtain the non-LTE\ncorrection online (http://spectrum.inasan.ru/nLTE/) for an individual spectral\nline and given atmospheric parameters.\n", "  Observations of pre-transitional disks show a narrow inner dust ring and a\nlarger outer one. They are separated by a cavity with no or only little dust.\nWe propose an efficient recycling mechanism for the inner dust ring which keeps\nit in a steady-state. No major particle sources are needed for replenishment.\nDust particles and pebbles drift outwards by radiation pressure and\nphotophoresis. The pebbles grow during outward drift until they reach a\nbalanced position where residual gravity compensates photophoresis. While still\ngrowing larger they reverse their motion and drift inwards. Eventually, their\nspeed is fast enough that they get destroyed in collisions with other pebbles\nand drift outwards again. We quantify the force balance and drift velocities\nfor the disks LkCa15 and HD135344B. We simulate single particle evolution and\nshow that this scenario is viable. Growth and drift timescales are on the same\norder and a steady state can be established in the inner dust ring.\n", "  The curvaton reheating mechanism in a non-minimal derivative coupling to\ngravity for any non-oscillating (NO) model is studied. In this framework, we\nanalyze the energy density during the kinetic epoch and we find that this\nenergy has a complicated dependencies of the scale factor. Considering this\nmechanism, we study the decay of the curvaton in two different scenarios and\nalso we determine the reheating temperatures. As an example the NO model, we\nconsider an exponential potential and we obtain the reheating temperature\nindirectly from the inflation through of the number of e-folds.\n", "  The layer dependent structural, electronic and vibrational properties of SnS2\nand SnSe2 are investigated using first-principles density functional theory\n(DFT). The in-plane lattice constants, interlayer distances and binding\nenergies are found to be layer-independent. Bulk SnS2 and SnSe2 are both\nindirect band gap semiconductors with Eg = 2.18 eV and 1.07 eV, respectively.\nFew-layer and monolayer 2D systems also possess an indirect band gap, which is\nincreased to 2.41 eV and 1.69 eV for single layers of SnS2 and SnSe2. The\neffective mass theory of 2D excitons, which takes into account the combined\neffect of the anisotropy, non-local 2D screening and layer-dependent 3D\nscreening, predicts strong excitonic effects. The binding energy of indirect\nexcitons in monolayer samples, Ex~0.9 eV, is substantially reduced to Ex = 0.14\neV in bulk SnS2 and Ex = 0.09 eV in bulk SnSe2. The layer-dependent Raman\nspectra display a strong decrease of intensities of the Raman active A1g mode\nupon decreasing the number of layers down to a monolayer, by a factor of 7 in\nthe case of SnS2 and a factor of 20 in the case of SnSe2 which can be used to\nidentify number of layers in a 2D sample.\n", "  We analyze 15,000 spectra of 29 stellar-mass black hole candidates collected\nover the 16-year mission lifetime of RXTE using a simple phenomenological\nmodel. As these black holes vary widely in luminosity and progress through a\nsequence of spectral states, which we broadly refer to as hard and soft, we\nfocus on two spectral components: The Compton power law and the reflection\nspectrum it generates by illuminating the accretion disk. Our proxy for the\nstrength of reflection is the equivalent width of the Fe-K line as measured\nwith respect to the power law. A key distinction of our work is that for all\nstates we estimate the continuum under the line by excluding the thermal disk\ncomponent and using only the component that is responsible for fluorescing the\nFe-K line, namely the Compton power law. We find that reflection is several\ntimes more pronounced (~3) in soft compared to hard spectral states. This is\nmost readily caused by the dilution of the Fe line amplitude from Compton\nscattering in the corona, which has a higher optical depth in hard states.\nAlternatively, this could be explained by a more compact corona in soft\n(compared to hard) states, which would result in a higher reflection fraction.\n", "  We characterize the column density probability distributions functions (PDFs)\nof the atomic hydrogen gas, HI, associated with seven Galactic molecular clouds\n(MCs). We use 21 cm observations from the Leiden/Argentine/Bonn Galactic HI\nSurvey to derive column density maps and PDFs. We find that the peaks of the HI\nPDFs occur at column densities ranging from ~1-2$\\times 10^{21}$ cm$^2$\n(equivalently, ~0.5-1 mag). The PDFs are uniformly narrow, with a mean\ndispersion of $\\sigma_{HI}\\approx 10^{20}$ cm$^2$ (~0.1 mag). We also\ninvestigate the HI-to-H$_2$ transition towards the cloud complexes and estimate\nHI surface densities ranging from 7-16 $M_\\odot$ pc$^{-2}$ at the transition.\nWe propose that the HI PDF is a fitting tool for identifying the HI-to-H$_2$\ntransition column in Galactic MCs.\n", "  The present paper is based upon equations obtained in an earlier paper by the\nauthor devoted to a new formulation of quantum electrodynamics. The equations\ndescribe the structure of the electron as well as its motion in external\nfields, interaction with a measuring apparatus inclusive, in a deterministic\nmanner without any jumps. Quantum mechanics is an approximate theory because\nits equations follow from the above equations upon neglecting the self-field of\nthe electron itself. Just this leads to paradoxes, seeming contradictions and\njumps in quantum mechanics. The quantum mechanical wavefunction has a dual\ninterpretation. In some problems the square of its modulus represents a real\ndistribution of the electronic density while in others the same square\ndetermines the probability distribution of coordinates. It is shown why, given\nthe different interpretations of the wavefunction, it satisfies one and the\nsame Dirac or Schr\\\"odinger equation. Description of many-electron systems is\nalso considered in the starting approach as well as in quantum mechanics.\nNeutrinos are discussed in brief.\n", "  We present a detailed QCD analysis of nucleon structure functions $xF_3 (x,\nQ^2)$, based on Laplace transforms and Jacobi polynomials approach. The\nanalysis corresponds to the next-to-leading order and next-to-next-to-leading\norder approximation of perturbative QCD. The Laplace transform technique, as an\nexact analytical solution, is used for the solution of nonsinglet\nDokshitzer-Gribov-Lipatov-Altarelli-Parisi evolution equations at low- and\nlarge-$x$ values. The extracted results are used as input to obtain the $x$ and\nQ$^2$ evolution of $xF_3(x, Q^2)$ structure functions using the Jacobi\npolynomials approach. In our work, the values of the typical QCD scale\n$\\Lambda_{\\overline{\\rm MS}}^{(n_f)}$ and the strong coupling constant\n$\\alpha_s(M_Z^2)$ are determined for four quark flavors ($n_f=4$) as well. A\ncareful estimation of the uncertainties shall be performed using the Hessian\nmethod for the valence-quark distributions, originating from the experimental\nerrors. We compare our valence-quark parton distribution functions sets with\nthose of other collaborations; in particular with the {\\tt BBG}, {\\tt CT14},\n{\\tt MMHT14} and {\\tt NNPDF} sets, which are contemporary with the present\nanalysis. The obtained results from the analysis are in good agreement with\nthose from the literature.\n", "  With the high-resolution data from the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph,\nwe detect a light wall above a sunspot light bridge in the NOAA active region\n(AR) 12403. In the 1330 A slit-jaw images, the light wall is brighter than the\nambient areas while the wall top and base are much brighter than the wall body,\nand it keeps oscillating above the light bridge. A C8.0 flare caused by a\nfilament activation occurred in this AR with the peak at 02:52 UT on 2015\nAugust 28, and the flare's one ribbon overlapped the light bridge which was the\nobservational base of the light wall. Consequently, the oscillation of the\nlight wall was evidently disturbed. The mean projective oscillation amplitude\nof the light wall increased from 0.5 Mm to 1.6 Mm before the flare, and\ndecreased to 0.6 Mm after the flare. We suggest that the light wall shares a\ngroup of magnetic field lines with the flare loops, which undergo a magnetic\nreconnection process, and they constitute a coupled system. When the magnetic\nfield lines are pushed upwards at the pre-flare stage, the light wall turns to\nthe vertical direction, resulting in the increase of the light wall's\nprojective oscillation amplitude. After the magnetic reconnection takes place,\na group of new field lines with smaller scales are formed underneath the\nreconnection site and the light wall inclines. Thus, the projective amplitude\ndecreases remarkably at the post-flare stage.\n", "  Earlier work on quantum revivals is extended to Maxwell fields (aka spin-one\nsingletons). An evaluation of the Casimir energy on the generalised Einstein\nuniverse is also done to illustrate the utility of the Barnes zeta--function\nand generalised Bernoulli polynomials. Contact is made with some recent\ncalculations in AdS/CFT. In particular. higher order singletons are considered\nwith the Casimir energy being a polynomial in the order.\n", "  Topological insulators (TI) are a phase of matter that host unusual metallic\nstates on their surfaces. Unlike the states that exist on the surface of\nconventional materials, these so-called topological surfaces states (TSS) are\nprotected against disorder-related localization effects by time reversal\nsymmetry through strong spin-orbit coupling. By combining transport\nmeasurements, angle-resolved photo-emission spectroscopy and scanning tunneling\nmicroscopy, we show that there exists a critical level of disorder beyond which\nthe TI Bi2Se3 loses its ability to protect the metallic TSS and transitions to\na fully insulating state. The absence of the metallic surface channels dictates\nthat there is a change in topological character, implying that disorder can\nlead to a topological phase transition even without breaking the time reversal\nsymmetry. This observation challenges the conventional notion of\ntopologically-protected surface states, and will provoke new studies as to the\nfundamental nature of topological phase of matter in the presence of disorder.\n", "  We introduce expandable partial propensity direct method (EPDM) - a new exact\nstochastic simulation algorithm suitable for systems involving many interacting\nmolecular species. The algorithm is especially efficient for sparsely populated\nsystems, where the number of species that may potentially be generated is much\ngreater than the number of species actually present in the system at any given\ntime. The number of operations per reaction scales linearly with the number of\nspecies, but only those which have one or more molecules. To achieve this kind\nof performance we are employing a data structure which allows to add and remove\nspecies and their interactions on the fly. When a new specie is added, its\ninteractions with every other specie are generated dynamically by a set of\nuser-defined rules. By removing the records involving the species with zero\nmolecules, we keep the number of species as low as possible. This enables\nsimulations of systems for which listing all species is not practical. The\nalgorithm is based on partial propensities direct method (PDM) by Ramaswamy et\nal. for sampling trajectories of the chemical master equation.\n", "  I give my perspective on promising directions for high energy physics in\ncoming years.\n", "  A two-dimensional collective Hamiltonian (2DCH) on both azimuth and polar\nmotions in triaxial nuclei is proposed to investigate the chiral and wobbling\nmodes. In the 2DCH, the collective potential and the mass parameters are\ndetermined from three-dimensional tilted axis cranking (TAC) calculations. The\nbroken chiral and signature symmetries in the TAC solutions are restored by the\n2DCH. The validity of the 2DCH is illustrated with a triaxial rotor\n($\\gamma=-30^\\circ$) coupling to one $h_{11/2}$ proton particle and one\n$h_{11/2}$ neutron hole. By diagonalizing the 2DCH, the angular momenta and\nenergy spectra are obtained. These results agree with the exact solutions of\nthe particle rotor model (PRM) at high rotational frequencies. However, at low\nfrequencies, the energies given by the 2DCH are larger than those by the PRM\ndue to the underestimation of the mass parameters. In addition, with increasing\nangular momentum, the transitions from the chiral vibration to chiral rotation\nand further to longitudinal wobbling motion have been presented in the 2DCH.\n", "  We present an application of the boosted regression tree algorithm for\npredicting ground state energies of molecules made up of C, H, N, O, P, and S\n(CHNOPS). The PubChem chemical compound database has been incorporated to\nconstruct a dataset of 16,242 molecules, whose electronic ground state energies\nhave been computed using density functional theory. This dataset is used to\ntrain the boosted regression tree algorithm, which allows a computationally\nefficient and accurate prediction of molecular ground state energies.\nPredictions from boosted regression trees are compared with neural network\nregression, a widely used method in the literature, and shown to be more\naccurate with significantly reduced computational cost. The performance of the\nregression model trained using the CHNOPS set is also tested on a set of\ndistinct molecules that contain additional Cl and Si atoms. It is shown that\nthe learning algorithms lead to a rich and diverse possibility of applications\nin molecular discovery and materials informatics.\n", "  We report on the evidence of highly blue-shifted resonance lines of the\nsingly ionised isotope of 7BeII in high resolution UVES spectra of Nova\nSagittarii 2015 No. 2 (V5668 Sgr). The resonance doublet lines 7BeII at lambda\n313.0583, 313.1228 nm are clearly detected in several non saturated and\npartially resolved high velocity components during the evolution of the\noutburst. The total absorption identified with Beryllium has an equivalent\nwidth much larger than all other elements and comparable to hydrogen. We\nestimate an atomic fraction N(7Be)/N(Ca) ~ 53-69 from unsaturated and resolved\nabsorption components. The detection of 7Be in several high velocity components\nshows that it has been freshly created in a thermonuclear runaway via the\nreaction 3He}(alpha,gamma) 7Be during the Nova explosion, as postulated by\nArnould and Norgaard (1975) , however in much larger amounts than predicted by\ncurrent models. 7Be decays to 7Li with a half-life of 53.22 days, comparable to\nthe temporal span covered by the observations. The non detection of LiI\nrequires that LiII remains ionised throughout our observations. The massive 7Be\nejecta result into a 7Li production that is about 4.7-4.9 dex above the\nmeteoritic abundance. If such a high production is common even in a small\nfraction (~5%) of Novae, they can make all the \"stellar\" 7Li of the Milky Way.\n", "  Field-like spin orbit torque in FeMn/Pt bilayers with ultra-thin\npolycrystalline FeMn has been characterized through planar Hall effect\nmeasurements. A large effective field is obtained for FeMn in the thickness\nrange of 2 to 5 nm. The experimental observations can be reasonably accounted\nfor by using a macro-spin model under the assumption that the FeMn layer is\ncomposed of two spin sublattices with unequal magnetizations. The large\neffective field corroborates the spin Hall origin of the effective field\nconsidering the much smaller uncompensated net moments in FeMn as compared to\nNiFe. The effective absorption of spin current by FeMn is further confirmed by\nthe fact that spin current generated by Pt in NiFe/FeMn/Pt trilayers can only\ntravel through the FeMn layer with a thickness of 1 to 4 nm. By quantifying the\nfield-like effective field induced in NiFe, a spin diffusion length of 2 nm is\nestimated in FeMn, in consistence with values reported in literature by\nferromagnetic resonance and spin-pumping experiments.\n", "  Advancing open atmosphere printing technologies to produce features in the\nnanoscale range has important and broad applications ranging from electronics,\nto photonics, plasmonics and biology. Recently an electrohydrodynamic printing\nregime has been demonstrated in a rapid dripping mode (termed NanoDrip), where\nthe ejected colloidal droplets from nozzles of diameters of O(1 {\\mu}m) can\ncontrollably reach sizes an order of magnitude smaller than the nozzle and can\ngenerate planar and out-of-plane structures of similar sizes. Despite\ndemonstrated capabilities, our fundamental understanding of important aspects\nof the physics of NanoDrip printing needs further improvement. Here we address\nthe topics of charge content and transport in NanoDrip printing. We employ\nquantum dot and gold nanoparticle dispersions in combination with a specially\ndesigned, auxiliary, asymmetric electric field, targeting the understanding of\ncharge locality (particles vs. solvent) and particle distribution in the\ndeposits as indicated by the dried nanoparticle patterns (footprints) on the\nsubstrate. We show that droplets of alternating charge can be spatially\nseparated when applying an ac field to the nozzle. The nanoparticles within a\ndroplet are distributed asymmetrically under the influence of the auxiliary\nlateral electric field, indicating that they are the main carriers. We also\nshow that the ligand length of the nanoparticles in the colloid affects their\nmobility after deposition (in the sessile droplet state).\n", "  We study the degree of success of a single predator hunting a herd of prey on\na two dimensional square lattice landscape. We explicitly consider the self\nvolume of the prey restraining their dynamics on the lattice. The movement of\nboth predator and prey is chosen to include an intelligent, decision making\nstep based on their respective sighting ranges, the radius in which they can\ndetect the other species (prey cannot recognise each other besides the self\nvolume interaction): after spotting each other the motion of prey and predator\nturns from a nearest neighbour random walk into direct escape or chase,\nrespectively. We consider a large range of prey densities and sighting ranges\nand compute the mean first passage time for a predator to catch a prey as well\nas characterise the effective dynamics of the hunted prey. We find that the\nprey's sighting range dominates their life expectancy and the predator profits\nmore from a bad eyesight of the prey than from his own good eye sight. We\ncharacterise the dynamics in terms of the mean distance between the predator\nand the nearest prey. It turns out that effectively the dynamics of this\ndistance coordinate can be captured in terms of a simple Ornstein-Uhlenbeck\npicture. Reducing the many-body problem to a simple two-body problem by\nimagining predator and nearest prey to be connected by a Hookean bond, all\nfeatures of the model such as prey density and sighting ranges merge into the\neffective binding constant.\n", "  Experiments with multiwalled carbon nanotubes and graphite as targets in a\nsource of negative ions with cesium sputtering have shown that nanotubes with\nnanometer radii and micrometer length can be compared with micrometer size\ngraphite grains to understand the irradiation effects that include the\nformation, sputtering of carbon clusters and the resulting structural changes.\nThe simultaneous adsorption of cesium on the surface and bombardment by\nenergetic cesium ions is shown to play its role in the cluster formation and\nsputtering of carbon atoms and clusters and the cesium substituted carbon\nclusters as anions. Qualitative and quantitative sputtered species outputs are\nrelated to their respective structures. Structural changes are shown to occur\nin MWCNTs and seen in SEM micrographs. The individual identity of the heavily\nbombarded MWCNTs may have given way to the merged structures while effects on\nthe structure of heavily irradiated graphite grains size needs to be further\ninvestigated\n", "  Roth et al (2014a) reported evidence for plumes of water venting from a\nsouthern high latitude region on Europa - spectroscopic detection of off-limb\nline emission from the dissociation products of water. Here, we present Hubble\nSpace Telescope (HST) direct images of Europa in the far ultraviolet (FUV) as\nit transited the smooth face of Jupiter, in order to measure absorption from\ngas or aerosols beyond the Europa limb. Out of ten observations we found three\nin which plume activity could be implicated. Two show statistically significant\nfeatures at latitudes similar to Roth et al, and the third, at a more\nequatorial location. We consider potential systematic effects that might\ninfluence the statistical analysis and create artifacts, and are unable to find\nany that can definitively explain the features, although there are reasons to\nbe cautious. If the apparent absorption features are real, the magnitude of\nimplied outgassing is similar to that of the Roth et al feature, however the\napparent activity appears more frequently in our data.\n", "  We examine the entanglement of general mixed states of a two qubit Heisenberg\nXYZ chain in the presence of a magnetic field, and its detection by means of\ndifferent criteria. Both the exact separability conditions and the weaker\nconditions implied by the disorder and the von Neumann entropic criteria are\nanalyzed. The ensuing limit temperatures for entanglement in thermal states of\ndifferent XYZ models are then examined and compared with the limit temperature\nof the symmetry-breaking solution in a mean field type approximation. The\nlatter, though generally lower, can also be higher than the exact limit\ntemperature for entanglement in certain cases, indicating that\nsymmetry-breaking does not necessarily entail entanglement. The reentry of\nentanglement for increasing temperatures is also discussed.\n", "  We present photometry and long-slit spectroscopy for 12 S0 and spiral\ngalaxies selected from the Catalogue of Isolated Galaxies. The structural\nparameters of the sample galaxies are derived from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey\ni-band images by performing a two-dimensional photometric decomposition of the\nsurface brightness distribution. This is assumed to be the sum of the\ncontribution of a S\\`ersic bulge, an exponential disc, and a Ferrers bar\ncharacterized by elliptical and concentric isophotes with constant ellipticity\nand position angles. The rotation curves and velocity dispersion profiles of\nthe stellar component are measured from the spectra obtained along the major\naxis of galaxies. The radial profiles of the H{\\beta}, Mg and Fe line-strength\nindices are derived too. Correlations between the central values of the Mg 2\nand Fe line-strength indices and the velocity dispersion are found. The mean\nage, total metallicity and total {\\alpha}/Fe enhancement of the stellar\npopulation in the centre and at the radius where the bulge gives the same\ncontribution to the total surface brightness as the remaining components are\nobtained using stellar population models with variable element abundance\nratios. We identify intermediate-age bulges with solar metallicity and old\nbulges with a large spread in metallicity. Most of the sample bulges display\nsuper-solar {\\alpha}/Fe enhancement, no gradient in age and negative gradients\nof metallicity and {\\alpha}/Fe enhancement. These findings support a formation\nscenario via dissipative collapse where environmental effects are remarkably\nless important than in the assembly of bulges of galaxies in groups and\nclusters.\n", "  Observations point towards a close connection between nuclear starbursts,\nactive galactic nuclei (AGN), and outflow phenomena. An evolutionary sequence,\nstarting from a dust-obscured ultra-luminous infrared galaxy and eventually\nleading to an unobscured optical quasar, has been proposed and discussed in the\nliterature. AGN feedback is usually invoked to expel the obscuring gas and dust\nin a blow-out event, but the underlying physical mechanism remains unclear. We\nconsider AGN feedback driven by radiation pressure on dust, which directly acts\non the obscuring dusty gas. We obtain that radiative feedback can potentially\ndisrupt dense gas in the infrared-optically thick regime, and that an increase\nin the dust-to-gas fraction leads to an increase in the effective Eddington\nratio. Thus the more dusty gas is preferentially expelled by radiative\nfeedback, and the central AGN is prone to efficiently remove its own obscuring\ndust cocoon. Large amounts of dust imply heavy obscuration but also powerful\nfeedback, suggesting a causal link between dust obscuration and blow-out. In\nthis picture, AGN feedback and starburst phenomena are intrinsically coupled\nthrough the production of dust in supernova explosions, leading to a natural\ninterpretation of the observed evolutionary path.\n", "  Employing tidally enhanced stellar wind, we studied in binaries the effects\nof metallicity, mass ratio of primary to secondary, tidal enhancement\nefficiency and helium abundance on the formation of blue hook (BHk) stars in\nglobular clusters (GCs). A total of 28 sets of binary models combined with\ndifferent input parameters are studied. For each set of binary model, we\npresented a range of initial orbital periods that is needed to produce BHk\nstars in binaries. All the binary models could produce BHk stars within\ndifferent range of initial orbital periods. We also compared our results with\nthe observation in the Teff-logg diagram of GC NGC 2808 and {\\omega} Cen. Most\nof the BHk stars in these two GCs locate well in the region predicted by our\ntheoretical models, especially when C/N-enhanced model atmospheres are\nconsidered. We found that mass ratio of primary to secondary and tidal\nenhancement efficiency have little effects on the formation of BHk stars in\nbinaries, while metallicity and helium abundance would play important roles,\nespecially for helium abundance. Specifically, with helium abundance increasing\nin binary models, the space range of initial orbital periods needed to produce\nBHk stars becomes obviously wider, regardless of other input parameters\nadopted. Our results were discussed with recent observations and other\ntheoretical models.\n", "  The results from mass spectrometry of clusters sputtered from Cs+ irradiated\nsingle-walled carbon nano-tubes (SWCNTs) as a function of energy and dose\nidentify the nature of the resulting damage in the form of multiple vacancy\ngeneration. For pristine SWCNTs at all Cs+ energies, C2 is the most dominant\nspecies, followed by C3, C4 and C1. The experiments were performed in three\nstages: in the first stage, Cs+ energy E(Cs+) was varied. During the second\nstage, the nanotubes were irradiated continuously at E(Cs+) = 5 keV for 1,800\ns. Afterwards, the entire sequence of irradiation energies was repeated to\ndifferentiate between the fragmentation patterns of the pristine and of heavily\nirradiated SWCNTs. The sputtering and normalized yields identify the\nquantitative and relative extent of the ion-induced damage by creating double,\ntriple and quadruple vacancies; the single vacancies are least favored.\nSputtering from the heavily irradiated SWCNTs occurs not only from the damaged\nand fragmented nanotubes, but also from the inter-nanotube structures that are\ngrown due to the accumulation of the sputtered clusters. Similar irradiation\nexperiments were performed with the multi-walled carbon nanotubes; the results\nconfirmed the dominant C2 followed by C3, C4 and C1.\n", "  We put a spotlight on the exceptional magnetic properties of the metamagnetic\nHeusler alloy (Ni,Co)-Mn-Sn by means of first principles simulations.\n  In the energy landscape we find a multitude of local minima, which belong to\ndifferent ferrimagnetic states and are close in total magnetization and energy.\nAll these magnetic states correspond to the local high spin state of the Mn\natoms with different spin alignments and are related to the magnetic properties\nof Mn. Compared to pure Mn, the magneto-volume coupling is reduced by Ni, Co,\nand Sn atoms in the lattice and no local low-spin Mn states appear. For the\ncubic phase we find a ferromagnetic ground state whereas the global energy\nminimum is a tetragonal state with complicated spin structure and vanishing\nmagnetization which so far has been overlooked in simulations.\n", "  Context. Explaining the accelerated expansion of the Universe is one of the\nfundamental challenges in physics today. Cosmography provides information about\nthe evolution of the universe derived from measured distances, assuming only\nthat the space time ge- ometry is described by the\nFriedman-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker metric, and adopting an approach that\neffectively uses only Taylor expansions of basic observables. Aims. We perform\na high-redshift analysis to constrain the cosmographic expansion up to the\nfifth order. It is based on the Union2 type Ia supernovae data set, the\ngamma-ray burst Hubble diagram, a data set of 28 independent measurements of\nthe Hubble param- eter, baryon acoustic oscillations measurements from galaxy\nclustering and the Lyman-{\\alpha} forest in the SDSS-III Baryon Oscillation\nSpectroscopic Survey (BOSS), and some Gaussian priors on h and {\\Omega}M .\nMethods. We performed a statistical analysis and explored the probability\ndistributions of the cosmographic parameters. By building up their regions of\nconfidence, we maximized our likelihood function using the Markov chain Monte\nCarlo method. Results. Our high-redshift analysis confirms that the expansion\nof the Universe currently accelerates; the estimation of the jerk parameter\nindicates a possible deviation from the standard {\\Lambda}CDM cosmological\nmodel. Moreover, we investigate implications of our results for the\nreconstruction of the dark energy equation of state (EOS) by comparing the\nstandard technique of cosmography with an alternative approach based on\ngeneralized Pad\\'e approximations of the same observables. Because these\nexpansions converge better, is possible to improve the constraints on the\ncosmographic parameters and also on the dark matter EOS. Conclusions. The\nestimation of the jerk and the DE parameters indicates at 1{\\sigma} a possible\ndeviation from the {\\Lambda}CDM cosmological model.\n", "  We study the adsorption-desorption transition of polyelectrolyte chains onto\nplanar, cylindrical and spherical surfaces with arbitrarily high surface charge\ndensities by massive Monte Carlo computer simulations. We examine in detail how\nthe well known scaling relations for the threshold transition-demarcating the\nadsorbed and desorbed domains of a polyelectrolyte near weakly charged\nsurfaces-are altered for highly charged interfaces. In virtue of high surface\npotentials and large surface charge densities, the Debye-Hueckel approximation\nis often not feasible and the nonlinear Poisson-Boltzmann approach should be\nimplemented. At low salt conditions, for instance, the electrostatic potential\nfrom the nonlinear Poisson--Boltzmann equation is smaller than the\nDebye-Hueckel result, such that the required critical surface charge density\nfor polyelectrolyte adsorption $\\sigma_c$ increases. The nonlinear relation\nbetween the surface charge density and electrostatic potential leads to a\nsharply increasing critical surface charge density with growing ionic strength,\nimposing an additional limit to the critical salt concentration above which no\npolyelectrolyte adsorption occurs at all. We contrast our simulations findings\nwith the known scaling results for weak critical polyelectrolyte adsorption\nonto oppositely charged surfaces for the three standard geometries. Finally, we\ndiscuss some applications of our results for some physical-chemical and\nbiophysical systems.\n", "  We investigate the ensemble and time averaged mean squared displacements for\nparticle diffusion in a simple model for disordered media by assuming that the\nlocal diffusivity is both fluctuating in time and has a deterministic average\ngrowth or decay in time. In this study we compare computer simulations of the\nstochastic Langevin equation for this random diffusion process with analytical\nresults. We explore the regimes of normal Brownian motion as well as anomalous\ndiffusion in the sub- and superdiffusive regimes. We also consider effects of\nthe inertial term on the particle motion. The investigation of the resulting\ndiffusion is performed for unconfined and confined motion.\n", "  Let $K$ be the compact Lie group $USp(N/2)$ or $SO(N, R)$. Let $M^K_n$ be the\nmoduli space of framed K-instantons over $S^4$ with the instanton number $n$.\nBy Donaldson (1984), $M^K_n$ is endowed with a natural scheme structure. It is\na Zariski open subset of a GIT quotient of $\\mu^{-1}(0)$, where $\\mu$ is a\nholomorphic moment map such that $\\mu^{-1}(0)$ consists of the ADHM data. The\npurpose of the paper is to study the geometric properties of $\\mu^{-1}(0)$ and\nits GIT quotient, such as complete intersection, irreducibility, reducedness\nand normality. If $K=USp(N/2)$ then $\\mu$ is flat and $\\mu^{-1}(0)$ is an\nirreducible normal variety for any $n$ and even $N$. If $K = SO(N, R)$ the\nsimilar results are proven for low $n$ and $N$. As an application one can\nobtain a mathematical interpretation of the K-theoretic Nekrasov partition\nfunction of Nekrasov and Shadchin (2004).\n", "  Freeform optics aims to expand the toolkit of optical elements by allowing\nfor more complex phase geometries beyond rotational symmetry. Complex,\nasymmetric curvatures are employed to enhance the performance of optical\ncomponents while minimizing their weight and size. Unfortunately, these\nasymmetric forms are often difficult to manufacture at the nanoscale with\ncurrent technologies. Metasurfaces are planar sub-wavelength structures that\ncan control the phase, amplitude, and polarization of incident light, and can\nthereby mimic complex geometric curvatures on a flat, wavelength-scale thick\nsurface. We present a methodology for designing analogues of freeform optics\nusing a low contrast dielectric metasurface platform for operation at visible\nwavelengths. We demonstrate a cubic phase plate with a point spread function\nexhibiting enhanced depth of field over 300 {\\mu}m along the optical axis with\npotential for performing metasurface-based white light imaging, and an Alvarez\nlens with a tunable focal length range of over 2.5 mm with 100 {\\mu}m of total\nmechanical displacement. The adaptation of freeform optics to a sub-wavelength\nmetasurface platform allows for the ultimate miniaturization of optical\ncomponents and offers a scalable route toward implementing near-arbitrary\ngeometric curvatures in nanophotonics.\n", "  We compare the low eigenvalue spectra of the Overlap Dirac operator on two\nsets of configurations at $\\mu_I/\\mu_I^c$ = 0.5 and 1.5 generated with\ndynamical staggered fermions at these isospin chemical potential on $24^3\n\\times 6$ lattices. We find very small changes in the number of zero modes and\nlow lying modes which is in stark contrast with those across the corresponding\nfinite temperature phases where one sees a drop across the phase transition.\nPossible consequences are discussed.\n", "  The nature of the spiral structure of the Milky Way has long been debated.\nOnly in the last decade have astronomers been able to accurately measure\ndistances to a substantial number of high-mass star-forming regions, the\nclassic tracers of spiral structure in galaxies. We report distance\nmeasurements at radio wavelengths using the Very Long Baseline Array for eight\nregions of massive star formation near the Local spiral arm of the Milky Way.\nCombined with previous measurements, these observations reveal that the Local\nArm is larger than previously thought, and both its pitch angle and star\nformation rate are comparable to those of the Galaxy's major spiral arms, such\nas Sagittarius and Perseus. Toward the constellation Cygnus, sources in the\nLocal Arm extend for a great distance along our line of sight and roughly along\nthe solar orbit. Because of this orientation, these sources cluster both on the\nsky and in velocity to form the complex and long enigmatic Cygnus X region. We\nalso identify a spur that branches between the Local and Sagittarius spiral\narms.\n", "  We report the experimental demonstration of the induced\npolarization-dependent optical vortex beams. We use the Talbot configuration as\na method to probe this effect. In particular, our simple experiment shows the\ndirect measurement of this observation. Our experiment can exhibit clearly the\ncombination between the polarization and orbital angular momentum (OAM) states\nof light. This implementation might be useful for further studies in the\nquantum system or quantum information.\n", "  We develop a thermodynamic framework for modeling nonlinear ultrasonic damage\nsensing and prognosis in materials undergoing progressive damage. The framework\nis based on the internal variable approach and relies on the construction of a\npseudo-elastic strain energy function that captures the energetics associated\nwith the damage progression. The pseudo-elastic strain energy function is\ncomposed of two energy functions - one that describes how a material stores\nenergy in an elastic fashion and the other describes how material dissipates\nenergy or stores it in an inelastic fashion. Experimental motivation for the\nchoice of the above two functionals is discussed and some specific choices\npertaining to damage progression during fatigue and creep are presented. The\nthermodynamic framework is employed to model the nonlinear response of material\nundergoing stress relaxation and creep-like degradation. For each of the above\ncases, evolution of the nonlinearity parameter with damage as well as with\nmacroscopic measurables like accumulated plastic strain are obtained.\n", "  The study of synchronization of coupled systems is currently undergoing a\nmajor surge fueled by recent discoveries of new forms of collective dynamics\nand the development of techniques to characterize a myriad of new patterns of\nnetwork synchronization. This includes chimera states, phenomena determined by\nsymmetry, remote synchronization, and asymmetry-induced synchronization. This\nFocus Issue presents a selection of contributions at the forefront of these\ndevelopments, to which this introduction is intended to offer an up-to-date\nfoundation.\n", "  The Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) is a forthcoming international\nground-based observatory for very high-energy gamma rays. Its goal is to reach\nsensitivity five to ten times better than existing Cherenkov telescopes such as\nVERITAS, H.E.S.S. or MAGIC and extend the range of observation to energies down\nto few tens of GeV and beyond 100 TeV. To achieve this goal, an array of about\n100 telescopes is required, meaning a total reflective surface of several\nthousands of square meters. Thence, the optimal technology used for CTA mirrors\nmanufacture should be both low-cost (~1000 euros/m2) and allow high optical\nperformances over the 300-550 nm wavelength range. More exactly, a reflectivity\nhigher than 85% and a PSF (Point Spread Function) diameter smaller than 1 mrad.\nSurface roughness can significantly contribute to PSF broadening and limit\ntelescope performances. Fortunately, manufacturing techniques for mirrors are\nnow available to keep the optical scattering well below the\ngeometrically-predictable effect of figure errors. This paper determines first\norder surface finish tolerances based on a surface microroughness\ncharacterization campaign, using Phase Shift Interferometry. That allows us to\ncompute the roughness contribution to Cherenkov telescope PSF. This study is\nperformed for diverse mirror candidates (MAGIC-I and II, ASTRI, MST) varying in\nmanufacture technologies, selected coating materials and taking into account\nthe degradation over time due to environmental hazards.\n", "  We present a three-cavity network model with two modes in each cavity and a\nnon-linear medium that generates a Kerr type interaction via both self-phase\nand cross-phase modulation processes. We have two main goals. The first one is\nto generate a multipartite Maximally Entangled State (MES), starting from the\nground state of the system. We address the problem both without and with\ndissipation. Secondly, we want to protect the MES from decoherence. While\nstudying the MES, we analyze different bipartite and multipartite entanglement\nmeasures. We also study the effect of an Avoided Level Crossing (ALC)\nidentified by the critical behavior of the entanglement measures, thus showing\nthat the quantum correlations act as a witness for such phenomena. Our findings\nprovide the quantum tools to perform the operation of generation and protection\nof a maximally entangled state in a cavity QED environment.\n", "  On-chip integration of quantum optical systems could be a major factor\nenabling photonic quantum technologies. Unlike the case of electronics, where\nthe essential device is a transistor and the dominant material is silicon, the\ntoolbox of elementary devices required for both classical and quantum photonic\nintegrated circuits is vast. Therefore, many material platforms are being\nexamined to host the future quantum photonic computers and network nodes. We\ndiscuss the pros and cons of several platforms for realizing various elementary\ndevices, compare the current degrees of integration achieved in each platform\nand review several composite platform approaches.\n", "  We study the Cauchy problem for the compressible Euler equations in two\nspatial dimensions under any physical barotropic equation of state except that\nof a Chaplygin gas. We prove that the well-known phenomenon of shock formation\nin simple plane wave solutions, starting from smooth initial conditions, is\nstable under perturbations that break the plane symmetry. Moreover, we provide\na sharp asymptotic description of the singularity formation. The new feature of\nour work is that the perturbed solutions are allowed to have small but non-zero\nvorticity, even at the location of the shock. Thus, our results provide the\nfirst constructive description of the vorticity near a singularity formed from\ncompression: relative to a system of geometric coordinates adapted to the\nacoustic characteristics, the vorticity remains many times differentiable, all\nthe way up to the shock. In addition, relative to the Cartesian coordinates,\nthe vorticity remains bounded up to the shock.\n  To control the vorticity, we rely on a coalition of new geometric and\nanalytic insights that complement the ones used by Christodoulou in his\ngroundbreaking, sharp proof of shock formation in vorticity-free regions. In\nparticular, we rely on a new formulation of the compressible Euler equations\nexhibiting remarkable structures. To derive estimates, we construct an eikonal\nfunction adapted to the acoustic characteristics (which correspond to sound\nwave propagation) and a related set of geometric coordinates and differential\noperators. Thanks to the remarkable structure of the equations, the same set of\ncoordinates and differential operators can be used to analyze the vorticity,\nwhose characteristics are transversal to the acoustic characteristics. In\nparticular, our work provides the first constructive description of shock\nformation without symmetry assumptions in a system with multiple speeds.\n", "  We are conducting a large spectroscopic survey of over 130 Southern ZZ Cetis\nwith the Goodman Spectrograph on the SOAR Telescope. Because it employs a\nsingle instrument with high UV throughput, this survey will both improve the\nsignal-to-noise of the sample of SDSS ZZ Cetis and provide a uniform dataset\nfor model comparison. We are paying special attention to systematics in the\nspectral fitting and quantify three of those systematics here. We show that\nrelative positions in the $\\log{g}$-$T_{\\rm eff}$ plane are consistent for\nthese three systematics.\n", "  We compute, from first principles, the absolute dose or fluence distribution\nper incident proton charge in a known heterogeneous terrain exposed to known\nproton beams. The algorithm is equally amenable to scattered or scanned beams.\nAll objects in the terrain (including collimators) are sliced into slabs, of\nany convenient thickness, perpendicular to the nominal beam direction.\n  Transport is by standard Fermi-Eyges theory. Transverse heterogeneities are\nhandled by breaking up pencil beams (PBs) either by conventional redefinition\nor a new form of 2D recursive dynamic splitting: the mother PB is replaced,\nconserving emittance and charge, by seven daughters of equal transverse size.\nOne has 1/4 the charge and travels in the mother's direction and six have 1/8\nthe charge, are arranged hexagonally and radiate from the mother's virtual\npoint source.\n  The longitudinal (energy-like) variable is pv (proton momentum times speed).\nEach material encountered is treated on its own merits, not referenced to\nwater. Slowing down is handled by $R=a(pv)^b$ fitted to standard range-energy\ntables. Multiple Coulomb scattering is handled by a scattering power\n$T_\\mathrm{dM}$ acting as a proxy for Moliere theory. We present examples from\na proof-of-principle Fortran program and speculate about putting the algorithm\ninto practice.\n", "  We derive a new formulation of the compressible Euler equations exhibiting\nremarkable structures, including surprisingly good null structures. The new\nformulation comprises covariant wave equations for the Cartesian components of\nthe velocity and the logarithmic density coupled to a transport equation for\nthe specific vorticity, defined to be vorticity divided by density. The\nequations allow one to use the full power of the geometric vectorfield method\nin treating the \"wave part\" of the system.\n  A crucial feature of the new formulation is that all derivative-quadratic\ninhomogeneous terms verify the strong null condition. The latter is a nonlinear\ncondition signifying the complete absence of nonlinear interactions involving\nmore than one differentiation in a direction transversal to the acoustic\ncharacteristics. Moreover, the same good structures are found in the equations\nverified by the Euclidean divergence and curl of the specific vorticity. This\nis important because one needs to combine estimates for the divergence and curl\nwith elliptic estimates to obtain sufficient regularity for the specific\nvorticity, whose derivatives appears as inhomogeneous terms in the wave\nequations.\n  The above structures collectively open the door for our forthcoming results:\nexhibiting a stable regime in which initially smooth solutions develop a shock\nsingularity (in particular the first Cartesian coordinate partial derivatives\nof the velocity and density blow up) while, relative to a system of geometric\ncoordinates adapted to the acoustic characteristics, the solution (including\nthe vorticity) remains many times differentiable, all the way up to the shock.\nThe good null structures, which are often associated with global solutions, are\nin fact key to proving that the shock singularity forms. Our secondary goal in\nthis article is to overview the central role that the structures play in the\nproof.\n", "  Strain-mediated thin film multiferroics comprising\npiezoelectric/ferromagnetic heterostructures enable the electrical manipulation\nof magnetization with much greater efficiency than other methods; however, the\ninvestigation of nanostructures fabricated from these materials is limited.\nHere we characterize ferromagnetic Ni nanostructures grown on a ferroelectric\nPMN-PT substrate using scanning electron microscopy with polarization analysis\n(SEMPA) and micromagnetic simulations. The magnetization of the Ni\nnanostructures can be controlled with a combination of sample geometry and\napplied electric field, which strains the ferroelectric substrate and changes\nthe magnetization via magnetoelastic coupling. We evaluate two types of\nsimulations of ferromagnetic nanostructures on strained ferroelectric\nsubstrates: conventional micromagnetic simulations including a simple uniaxial\nstrain, and coupled micromagnetic-elastodynamic simulations. Both simulations\nqualitatively capture the response of the magnetization changes produced by the\napplied strain, with the coupled solution providing more accurate\nrepresentation.\n", "  We construct a cocycle representative of the elliptic Thom class using\nanalytic methods inspired by a 2-dimensional free fermion field theory. This\nproduces the complexified string orientation of elliptic cohomology, and hence\ndetermines a pushfoward for families of rational string manifolds. We construct\na second pushforward motivated by the supersymmetric nonlinear sigma model\nstudied by Witten in relation to the Dirac operator on loop space. We show that\nthese two pushforwards agree. Analogous constructions in 1-dimensional field\ntheories produce the Mathai--Quillen Thom form in complexified K-theory and the\n$\\hat{A}$-class for a family of oriented manifolds.\n", "  One of the objectives of the pedestrian analysis is to evaluate the effects\nof proposed policy on the pedestrian facilities before its implementation. The\nimplementation of a policy without pedestrian analysis might lead to a very\ncostly trial and error due to the implementation cost (i.e. user cost,\nconstruction time and cost, etc.). On the other hand, using good analysis\ntools, the trial and error of policy could be done in the analysis level. Once\nthe analysis could prove a good performance, the implementation of the policy\nis straightforward. The problem is how to evaluate the impact of the policy\nquantitatively toward the behavior of pedestrians before its implementation.\nSince the interaction of pedestrians cannot be well address using a macroscopic\nlevel of analysis, a microscopic level of analysis is the choice. However, the\nanalytical solution of the microscopic pedestrian model is very difficult and\nsimulation models are more practical approach. To evaluate the impact of the\npolicy quantitatively toward the behavior of pedestrians before its\nimplementation, a microscopic pedestrian simulation model was developed. The\nmodel was based on physical forces, which work upon each pedestrian\ndynamically. To demonstrate the numerical analysis of the model, an\nexperimental policy on pedestrian crossing was performed. The simulation\nresults showed that the keep right policy or the lane-like segregation policy\nis inclined to be superior to do minimum or mix-lane policy in terms of average\nspeed, average delay and dissipation time.\n", "  It is shown that the set of equations known as Maxwell's equations perfectly\ndescribe two very different systems: (1) the usual electromagnetic phenomena in\nvacuum or in the matter and (2) the deformation of isotropic solid lattices,\ncontaining topological defects as dislocations and disclinations, in the case\nof constant and homogenous expansion. The analogy between these two physical\nsystems is complete, as it is not restricted to one of the two Maxwell's\nequation couples in the vacuum, but generalized to the two equation couples as\nwell as to the diverse phenomena of dielectric polarization and magnetization\nof matter, just as to the electrical charges and the electrical currents. The\neulerian approach of the solid lattice developed here includes Maxwell's\nequations as a special case, since it stems from a tensor theory, which is\nreduced to a vector one by contraction on the tensor indices. Considering the\ntensor aspect of the eulerian solid lattice deformation theory, the analogy can\nbe extended to other physical phenomena than electromagnetism, a point which is\nshortly discussed at the end of the paper.\n", "  We consider disordered tight-binding models which Green's functions obey the\nself-consistent cavity equations . Based on these equations and the replica\nrepresentation, we derive an analytical expression for the fractal dimension\nD_{1} that distinguishes between the extended ergodic, D_{1}=1, and extended\nnon-ergodic (multifractal), 0<D_{1}<1 states. The latter corresponds to the\nsolution with broken replica symmetry, while the former corresponds to the\nreplica-symmetric solution. We prove the existence of the extended non-ergodic\nphase in a broad range of disorder strength and energy as well as existence of\ntransition between the two extended phases. The results are applied to the\nsystems with local tree structure (Bethe lattices) and to the systems with\ninfinite connectivity (Rosenzweig-Poter random matrix theory). We obtain the\nphase diagram in the disorder-energy plain for the Bethe lattice and identify\ntwo insulating phases classified by the (one-step) replica symmetry breaking\nparameter. Finally we express the line of the Anderson localization transition,\nthe stability limit of the non-ergodic extended phase and the line of the first\norder transitions between the two extended phases in terms of the Lyapunov\nexponents.\n", "  In this article a comparative study of the renormalization of entanglement in\none, two and three dimensional space and its relation with quantum phase\ntransition (QPT) near the critical point is presented by implementing the\nQuantum Renormalization Group (QRG) technique. Adopting the Kadanoff's block\napproach, numerical results for the concurrence are obtained for the spin -1/2\n$XY$ model in all the spatial dimensions. The results show similar qualitative\nbehavior as we move from the lower to the higher dimensions in space but the\nnumber of iterations reduces for achieving the QPT in the thermodynamic limit.\nWe find that in the two dimensional and three dimensional spin -1/2 $XY$ model,\nmaximum values of the concurrence reduce by the factor of $1/n$ $(n=2,3)$ with\nreference to the maximum value of one dimensional case. Moreover, we study the\nscaling behavior and the entanglement exponent. We compare the results for one,\ntwo and three dimensional cases and illustrate how the system evolves near the\ncritical point.\n", "  This book chapter reviews the experimental evidence for magnetic phenomena at\nthe LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interface. We argue that essentially all of the signatures of\nmagnetism can be sorted into two distinct categories: (1) magnetic phases\n(e.g., ferromagnetic or Kondo) involving local magnetic moments and their\ncoupling to itinerant electrons; (2) metamagnetic effects that are mediated by\nattractive electron-electron interactions that do not involve local moments. We\nreview possible candidates for the local moments that give rise to the\nferromagnetic phases and focus on arguments for one potential source: oxygen\nvacancies. For the metamagnetic transport signatures, band-structure effects\n(e.g., Lifshitz transition) and strong attractive electron-electron interaction\ncan help consolidate disparate experimental findings.\n", "  Partially-depleted cores are practically ubiquitous in luminous early-type\ngalaxies (M$_{B}\\lesssim-$20.5 mag), and typically smaller than 1 kpc. In one\npopular scenario, supermassive black hole binaries --- established during dry\n(i.e. gas-poor) galaxy mergers --- kick out the stars from a galaxy's central\nregion via three-body interactions. Here, this \"binary black hole scouring\nscenario\" is probed at its extremes by investigating the two galaxies reported\nto have the largest partially-depleted cores found to date:\n2MASX~J09194427+5622012 and 2MASX~J17222717+3207571 (the brightest galaxy in\nAbell~2261). We have fit these galaxy's two-dimensional light distribution\nusing the core-S\\'{e}rsic model, and found that the former galaxy has a\ncore-S\\'{e}rsic break radius $R_{b,cS}=0.55$~kpc, three times smaller than the\npublished value. We use this galaxy to caution that other reportedly large\nbreak radii may too have been over-estimated if they were derived using the\n\"sharp-transition\" (inner core)-to-(outer S\\'{e}rsic) model. In the case of\n2MASX~J17222717+3207571, we obtain $R_{b,cS}=3.6$~kpc. While we confirm that\nthis is the biggest known partially-depleted core of any galaxy, we stress that\nit is larger than expected from the evolution of supermassive black hole\nbinaries --- unless one invokes substantial gravitational-wave-induced (black\nhole)-recoil events. Given the presence of multiple nuclei located (in\nprojection) within the core radius of this galaxy, we explored and found\nsupport for the alternative \"stalled infalling perturber\" core-formation\nscenario, in which this galaxy's core could have been excavated by the action\nof an infalling massive perturber.\n", "  As the quantity and resolution of spectral-cubes from optical/infrared and\nradio surveys increase, desktop-based visualization and analysis solutions must\nadapt and evolve. Novel immersive 3D environments such as the CAVE2 at Monash\nUniversity can overcome personal computer's visualization limitations. CAVE2 is\npart advanced 2D/3D visualization space (80 stereo-capable screens providing a\ntotal of 84 million pixels) and part supercomputer ($\\sim100$ TFLOPS of\nintegrated GPU-based processing power). We present a novel visualization system\nenabling simultaneous 3D comparative visualization of $\\sim100$ spectral-cubes.\nWith CAVE2 augmented by our newly developed web-based controller interface,\nastronomers can easily organise spectral-cubes on the different display panels,\napply real-time transforms to one or many spectral cubes, and request\nquantitative information about the displayed data. We also discuss how such a\nsolution can help accelerate the discovery rate in varied research scenarios.\n", "  Pure amorphous solids are traditionally considered to set the lower bound of\nthermal conductivity due to their disordered atomic structure that impedes\nvibrational energy transport. However, the lower limits for thermal\nconductivity in heterogeneous amorphous solids and the physical mechanisms\nunderlying these limits remain unclear. Here, we use equilibrium molecular\ndynamics to show that an amorphous SiGe nanocomposite can possess thermal\nconductivity substantially lower than those of the amorphous Si and Ge\nconstituents. Normal mode analysis indicates that the presence of the Ge\ninclusion localizes vibrational modes with frequency above the Ge cutoff in the\nSi host, drastically reducing their ability to transport heat. This observation\nsuggests a general route to achieve exceptionally low thermal conductivity in\nfully dense solids by restricting the vibrational density of states available\nfor transport in heterogeneous amorphous nanocomposites.\n", "  We present the effects of lead doping on the thermoelectric properties of\nTellurium Telluride, prepared by solid state reactions in an evacuated sealed\nsilica tubes. Structurally, all these compounds were found to be phase pure as\nconfirmed by the x-rays and energy dispersive spectroscopy analysis. The\nSeebeck co-efficient S was measured for all these compounds which show that S\nincreases with increasing temperature from 295 to 550 K. The Seebeck\ncoefficient is positive for the whole temperature range, showing p-type\nsemiconductor characteristics. Complex behavior of Seebeck coefficient for lead\ndoped compounds has been observed that at room temperature, the values of S for\nthese compounds have complex behavior, first S decreasing with increase in lead\nconcentration, and then S increases with increase in lead contents up to\nSimilarly the electrical conductivity and the power factors have also complex\nbehavior with lead concentrations. The power factor observed for these\ncompounds are increases with increase in the whole temperature range studied\nhere.\n", "  The mineral sphalerite (ZnS) is a typical constituent at the periphery of\nsubmarine hydrothermal deposits on Earth. It has been frequently suggested to\nhave played an important role in the prebiotic chemistry due to its prominent\nphotocatalytic activity. Nevertheless, the need for {\\lambda} < 344 nm UV\nradiation, which accounts for a very minor part of the energy range of the\nincoming solar spectrum, limits the application of this semiconductor. In this\npaper we employed a simple co-precipitation method for the fabrication of Fe,\nNi, and Cu-doped ZnS colloids and investigated their activities in the\nphotocatalyzed reduction of fumaric acid. The results show that the\nphotocatalytic activity of pristine ZnS is almost identical with that of 0.1\natom% Fe-doped ZnS, but decreases by doping 0.1 atom% Ni. However, it can be\nsignificantly enhanced by doping Cu because this dopant makes the optical\nabsorption edges of ZnS shift from UV band to longer wavelengths. The optimal\ndoping concentration was found to be 0.3 atom%. Even under {\\lambda} > 450 nm\nlight irradiation, the photocatalyst Zn1-xCuxS can drive the reduction of\nfumaric acid to produce succinic acid. Given the existence of this doped\nsemiconductor in the hydrothermal vents on early Earth and its capability to\nutilize both UV and visible light, ZnS might have participated more efficiently\nthan ever estimated in the prebiotic chemical evolution.\n", "  Intense, single-cycle terahertz (THz) pulses offer a promising approach for\nunderstanding and controlling the properties of a material on an ultrafast time\nscale. In particular, resonantly exciting phonons leads to a better\nunderstanding of how they couple to other degrees of freedom in the material\n(e.g., ferroelectricity, conductivity and magnetism) while enabling coherent\ncontrol of lattice vibrations and the symmetry changes associated with them.\nHowever, an ultrafast method for observing the resulting structural changes at\nthe atomic scale is essential for studying phonon dynamics. A simple approach\nfor doing this is optical second harmonic generation (SHG), a technique with\nremarkable sensitivity to crystalline symmetry in the bulk of a material as\nwell as at surfaces and interfaces. This makes SHG an ideal method for probing\nphonon dynamics in topological insulators (TI), materials with unique surface\ntransport properties. Here, we resonantly excite a polar phonon mode in the\ncanonical TI Bi$_2$Se$_3$ with intense THz pulses and probe the subsequent\nresponse with SHG. This enables us to separate the photoinduced lattice\ndynamics at the surface from transient inversion symmetry breaking in the bulk.\nFurthermore, we coherently control the phonon oscillations by varying the time\ndelay between a pair of driving THz pulses. Our work thus demonstrates a\nversatile, table-top tool for probing and controlling ultrafast phonon dynamics\nin materials, particularly at surfaces and interfaces, such as that between a\nTI and a magnetic material, where exotic new states of matter are predicted to\nexist.\n", "  The properties of the aperiodic brightness variability for the dwarf nova HL\nCMa are considered. The variability of the system HL CMa is shown to be\nsuppressed at frequencies above $7\\times10^{-3}$Hz. Different variability\nsuppression mechanisms related to the radiation reprocessing time, partial disk\nevaporation, and characteristic variability formation time are proposed. It has\nbeen found that the variability suppression frequency does not change when the\nsystem passes from the quiescent state to the outburst one, suggesting that the\naccretion flow geometry is invariable. It is concluded from the optical and\nX-ray luminosities of the system that the boundary layer on the white dwarf\nsurface is optically thick in both quiescent and outburst states. The latter\nimplies that the optically thick part of the accretion flow (disk) reaches the\nwhite dwarf surface. The accretion rate in the system, the flow geometry and\ntemperature have been estimated from the variability power spectra and spectral\ncharacteristics in a wide energy range, from the optical to X-ray.\n", "  It has been recently claimed that bulk crystals of transition metal\ndichalcogenide (TMD) ReS$_2$ are direct band gap semiconductors, which would\nmake this material an ideal candidate, among all TMDs, for the realization of\nefficient opto-electronic devices. The situation is however unclear, because\neven more recently an indirect transition in the photoluminescence spectra of\nthis material has been detected, whose energy is smaller than the supposed\ndirect gap. To address this issue we exploit the properties of ionic liquid\ngated field-effect transistors (FETs) to investigate the gap structure of bulk\nReS$_2$. Using these devices, whose high quality is demonstrated by a record\nhigh electron FET mobility of 1,100 cm$^2$/Vs at 4K, we can induce hole\ntransport at the surface of the material and determine quantitatively the\nsmallest band gap present in the material, irrespective of its direct or\nindirect nature. The value of the band gap is found to be 1.41 eV, smaller than\nthe 1.5 eV direct optical transition but in good agreement with the energy of\nthe indirect optical transition, providing an independent confirmation that\nbulk ReS$_2$ is an indirect band gap semiconductor. Nevertheless, contrary to\nthe case of more commonly studied semiconducting TMDs (e.g., MoS$_2$, WS$_2$,\netc.) in their bulk form, we also find that ReS$_2$ FETs fabricated on bulk\ncrystals do exhibit electroluminescence when driven in the ambipolar injection\nregime, likely because the difference between the direct and indirect gap is\nonly 100 meV. We conclude that ReS$_2$ does deserve more in-depth\ninvestigations in relation to possible opto-electronic applications.\n", "  In this paper we study fermion localization and resonances on a special type\nof braneworld model supporting brane splitting. In such models one can\nconstruct multi-wall branes which cause considerable simplification in field\nequations. We use a polynomial superpotential to construct this brane. The\nsuitable Yukawa coupling between the background scalar field and localized\nfermion is determined. The massive fermion resonance spectrum is obtained. The\nnumber of resonances is increased for higher values of Yukawa coupling.\n", "  Data on thermal absorptivity and emissivity are important for calculations of\nheat flows in cryogenic devices. Although thermal radiative properties of\nmaterials used in cryogenics are measured, published and used for more than\nsixty years we have noticed that sometimes users of that data do not well\nunderstand the significance of individual factors influencing thermal radiative\nproperties. The sensitivity of the thermal radiative properties of metals to\nthe condition of the surface and the difficulty of measurement, especially at\nlow temperatures is probably the reason of dispersion of the published values.\nThe effect of the material and its purity, finishing (machining, mechanical or\nchemical polishing) and of the protective coatings or accidental layers (water,\noxidation) on the thermal radiative properties is not always obvious. Influence\nof the material, surface treatment, roughness and layers on the surface is\ndiscussed on the basis of our 20 year experience with measurement of the\nemissivity and absorptivity in the range from 20 K to 300 K.\n", "  Low surface brightness galaxies (LSBGs) represent a significant percentage of\nlocal galaxies but their formation and evolution remain elusive. They may hold\ncrucial information for our understanding of many key issues (i.e., census of\nbaryonic and dark matter, star formation in the low density regime, mass\nfunction). The most massive examples - the so called giant LSBGs - can be as\nmassive as the Milky Way, but with this mass being distributed in a much larger\ndisk. Malin 1 is an iconic giant LSBG, perhaps the largest disk galaxy known.\nWe attempt to bring new insights on its structure and evolution on the basis of\nnew images covering a wide range in wavelength. We have computed surface\nbrightness profiles (and average surface brightnesses in 16 regions of\ninterest), in six photometric bands (FUV, NUV, u, g, i, z). We compared these\ndata to various models, testing a variety of assumptions concerning the\nformation and evolution of Malin 1. We find that the surface brightness and\ncolor profiles can be reproduced by a long and quiet star-formation history due\nto the low surface density; no significant event, such as a collision, is\nnecessary. Such quiet star formation across the giant disk is obtained in a\ndisk model calibrated for the Milky Way, but with an angular momentum\napproximately 20 times larger. Signs of small variations of the star-formation\nhistory are indicated by the diversity of ages found when different regions\nwithin the galaxy are intercompared.For the first time, panchromatic images of\nMalin 1 are used to constrain the stellar populations and the history of this\niconic example among giant LSBGs. Based on our model, the extreme disk of Malin\n1 is found to have a long history of relatively low star formation (about 2\nMsun/yr). Our model allows us to make predictions on its stellar mass and\nmetallicity.\n", "  The results of a comprehensive statistical analysis of gender systematics in\nthe time allocation process at European Southern Observatory (ESO) are\npresented. The sample on which the study is based includes more than 13000\nNormal and Short proposals, submitted by about 3000 principal investigators\n(PI) over eight years. The genders of PIs, and of the panel members of the\nObserving Programmes Committee (OPC), were used, together with their career\nlevel, to analyse the grade distributions and the proposal success rates.\nProposals submitted by female PIs show a significantly lower probability of\nbeing allocated time. The proposal success rates (defined as number of top\nranked runs over requested runs) are 16.0$\\pm$0.6% and 22.0$\\pm$0.4% for\nfemales and males, respectively. To a significant extent the disparity is\nrelated to different input distributions in terms of career level. The\nseniority of male PIs is significantly higher than that of female PIs, with\nonly 34% of the female PIs being professionally employed astronomers (compared\nto 53% for male PIs). A small, but statistically significant, gender-dependent\nbehaviour is measured for the OPC referees: both genders show the same\nsystematics, but they are larger for males than females. The PI female/male\nfraction is very close to 30/70; although far from parity, the fraction is\nhigher than that observed, for instance, among IAU membership.\n", "  Coherently coupled pairs or multimers of nitrogen-vacancy defect electron\nspins in diamond have many promising applications especially in quantum\ninformation processing (QIP) but also in nanoscale sensing applications.\nScalable registers of spin qubits are essential to the progress of QIP. Ion\nimplantation is the only known technique able to produce defect pairs close\nenough to allow spin coupling via dipolar interaction. Although several\ncompeting methods have been proposed to increase the resulting resolution of\nion implantation, the reliable creation of working registers is still to be\ndemonstrated. The current limitation are residual radiation-induced defects,\nresulting in degraded qubit performance as trade-off for positioning accuracy.\nHere we present an optimized estimation of nanomask implantation parameters\nthat are most likely to produce interacting qubits under standard conditions.\nWe apply our findings to a well-established technique, namely masks written in\nelectron-beam lithography, to create coupled defect pairs with a reasonable\nprobability. Furthermore, we investigate the scaling behavior and necessary\nimprovements to efficiently engineer interacting spin architectures.\n", "  We present details of our effective computational methods based on the\nreal-space finite-difference formalism to elucidate electronic and magnetic\nproperties of the two-dimensional (2D) materials within the framework of the\ndensity functional theory. The real-space finite-difference formalism enables\nus to treat truly 2D computational models by imposing individual boundary\ncondition on each direction. The formulae for practical computations under the\nboundary conditions specific to the 2D materials are derived and the electronic\nband structures of 2D materials are demonstrated using the proposed method.\nAdditionally, we introduce other first-principles works on the MoS2 monolayer\nfocusing on the modulation of electronic and magnetic properties originating\nfrom lattice defects.\n", "  We outline two concepts to explain Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECRs),\none based on radio galaxies and their relativistic jets and terminal hot spots,\nand one based on relativistic Super-Novae (SNe) or Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs) in\nstarburst galaxies, one matching the arrival direction data in the South (the\nradio galaxy Cen A) and one in the North (the starburst galaxy M82). Ubiquitous\nneutrino emission follows accompanied by compact TeV photon emission,\ndetectable more easily if the direction is towards Earth. The ejection of\nUHECRs is last. We have observed particles up to ZeV, neutrinos up to PeV,\nphotons up to TeV, 30 - 300 Hz GW events, and hope to detect soon of order Hz\nto mHz GW events. Energy turnover in single low frequency GW events may be of\norder 10^63 erg. How can we further test these concepts? First of all by\nassociating individual UHECR events, or directional groups of events, with\nchemical composition in both the Telescope Array (TA) Coll. and the Auger Coll.\ndata. Second by identifying more TeV to PeV neutrinos with recent SMBH mergers.\nThird by detecting the order < mHz GW events of SMBH binaries, and identifying\nthe galaxies host to the stellar BH mergers and their GW events in the range up\nto 300 Hz. Fourth by finally detecting the formation of the first generation of\nSMBHs and their mergers, surely a spectacular discovery.\n", "  We consider a scalar-tensor theory of gravitation with the scalar source\nbeing the trace of the stress-energy tensor of the scalar field itself and\nmatter. We obtain an example of a numerical solution of the cosmological\nequations which shows that under some special choice of the scalar parameters,\nthere exists a slow-roll regime in which the modern values of the Hubble and\ndeceleration parameters may be obtained.\n", "  In order to ensure the beam quality and meet the requirements introduced by\nthe BEPCII storage ring, the beam energy feedback system has been developed at\nthe exit of the linac. This paper describes the implementation and\ncommissioning of this system in detail. The energy feedback system consists of\nan energy measurement unit, an application software and an execution unit. In\norder to ensure the real-time monitoring and adjustment of beam energy, we need\nto introduce a non-interceptive type of online beam energy measurement method\nwhich is on the first try in China and the effective mechanism of energy\nadjustment to achieve this goal. The adjustment of energy is achieved by\nadjusting the output microwave phase of the RF power source station. The system\nwas put into operation in March 16th, 2016 and achieved the desired results. It\ncan effectively eliminate the low point of the injection rate caused by the\nfluctuation of the beam center energy and has played an important role in\nmaintaining a high constant injection rate.\n", "  We report a laser that coherently emits phonon-polaritons, quasi-particles\narising from the coupling between photons and transverse optical phonons. The\ngain is provided by an intersubband transition in a quantum cascade structure.\nThe polaritons at h$\\nu$ = 45.4meV (corresponding to an emission frequency of\n10.4THz) are formed by the transverse AlAs phonon mode of monolayer thin AlInAs\nlayers coupled to the optical modes of a Fabry-Perot cavity. The frequency\nlocation of the laser mode is in good agreement with the computed polaritonic\ndispersion and allows to quantify the constituent fractions of the emitted\npolaritons that reach a maximum of 50% for the phonon fraction. A fraction of\nthe gain (between 2-5%) originates directly from the coupling between the\nintersubband and the phonon polarizations. The device exhibits a very low\ntemperature dependence of its threshold current, as well as the capability to\noperate in very thin ($\\lambda/20$) optical cavities.\n", "  In the described device, the thermal emissivity or absorptivity of the sample\nis measured by substitution of the radiative heat flow between two parallel\nsurfaces by thermal output of a heater. Fast measurements of the mutual\nemissivity for the range of the temperature of the radiating surface 25 K-150 K\nare possible. The absorbing surface has a temperature between 5 K and 10 K when\nLHe is used as cryoliquid. The desired measurement sensitivity is 1 mK for\ntemperature and 0.1 {\\mu}W for heat power, respectively. The diameter of the\nwhole device is 50 mm and so it is possible to use a commercial dewar can for\nthe cooling. The form of the sample is a round plate 40 mm in diameter and 1 mm\nin thickness with one tested side. The emissivity and its temperature\ndependency for various surface treatments can be checked immediately before\napplication in a cryogenic system.\n", "  We present the \"Montreal White Dwarf Database\" (MWDD), an accessible database\nwith sortable/filterable table and interactive plots that will, when fully\ncompleted, allow the community to explore the physical properties of all white\ndwarfs ever analyzed by the Montreal group, as well as display data and\nanalyses from the literature. We present its current capability and show how it\nwill continuously be updated to instantly reflect improvements made on both the\ntheoretical and observational fronts.\n", "  We have demonstrated, both theoretically and experimentally, that it is\npossible to control (i.e., to enhance or cancel) the contrast of the\ninterference pattern appearing in the intensity images obtained with a laser\noptical feedback imaging (LOFI) setup using a bimode laser. The laser is\ncomposed of two coupled orthogonally polarized states that interact (i.e.,\ninterfere) through the cross saturation laser dynamics. We created the contrast\ncontrol by choosing the frequency shift (i.e., the beating frequency) between\nthe feedback electric fields and the intracavity electric fields. We have shown\nthat the interference contrast of the output power modulation of the laser\ntotal intensity is independent from the frequency shift and is always maximal.\nOn the other hand, the interference contrast of each polarization state is\nfrequency dependent. We obtained the maximal contrast when the frequency shift\nwas equal to one of the resonance frequencies of the bimode dynamics, and was\nvery low (and almost cancels) for an intermediate frequency located at the\nintersection of the two resonance curves.\n", "  The density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method generates the\nlow-energy states of linear systems of $N$ sites with a few degrees of freedom\nat each site by starting with a small system and adding sites step by step\nwhile keeping constant the dimension of the truncated Hilbert space. DMRG\nalgorithms are adapted to open chains with inversion symmetry at the central\nsite, to cyclic chains and to weakly coupled chains. Physical properties rather\nthan energy accuracy is the motivation. The algorithms are applied to the edge\nstates of linear Heisenberg antiferromagnets with spin $S \\ge 1$ and to the\nquantum phases of a frustrated spin-1/2 chain with exchange between first and\nsecond neighbors. The algorithms are found to be accurate for extended Hubbard\nand related 1D models with charge and spin degrees of freedom.\n", "  A new approach for calculating spectral density functions of strongly\ncorrelated electron systems is proposed within the exact diagonalization method\nof dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT). This approach is based on the analytic\ncontinuation of spectral density function obtained by conventional exact\ndiagonalization method of DMFT and its results are more reasonable in shape. As\nan example of its application, the Mott transition in a strongly correlated\nelectron system is investigated using this new approach.\n", "  Due to their high photospheric density, cool helium-rich white dwarfs\n(particularly DZ, DQpec and ultracool) are often poorly described by current\natmosphere models. As part of our ongoing efforts to design atmosphere models\nsuitable for all cool white dwarfs, we investigate how the ionization ratio of\nheavy elements and the H$_2$-He collision-induced absorption (CIA) spectrum are\naltered under fluid-like densities. For the conditions encountered at the\nphotosphere of cool helium-rich white dwarfs, our ab initio calculations show\nthat the ionization of most metals is inhibited and that the H$_2$-He CIA\nspectrum is significantly distorted for densities higher than 0.1 g/cm$^3$.\n", "  The Lagrange-mesh method is an approximate variational approach having the\nform of a mesh calculation because of the use of a Gauss quadrature. Although\nthis method provides accurate results in many problems with small number of\nmesh points, its accuracy can be strongly reduced by the presence of\nsingularities in the potential term. In this paper, a new regularized\nLagrange-Laguerre mesh, based on \\textit{exactly} orthonormal Lagrange\nfunctions, is devised. It is applied to two solvable radial potentials: the\nharmonic-oscillator and Coulomb potentials. In spite of the singularities of\nthe Coulomb and centrifugal potentials, accurate bound-state energies are\nobtained for all partial waves. The analysis of these results and a comparison\nwith other Lagrange-mesh calculations lead to a simple rule to predict in which\ncases a singularity does induce or not a significant loss of accuracy in\nLagrange-mesh calculations. In addition, the Lagrange-Laguerre-mesh approach is\napplied to the evaluation of phase shifts via integral relations. Small numbers\nof mesh points suffice to provide very accurate results.\n", "  An application of active contours without edges is presented as an efficient\nand effective means of extracting and characterizing coronal holes. Coronal\nholes are regions of low-density plasma on the Sun with open magnetic field\nlines. As the source of the fast solar wind, the detection and characterization\nof these regions is important for both testing theories of their formation and\nevolution and from a space weather perspective. Coronal holes are detected in\nfull disk extreme ultraviolet (EUV) images of the corona obtained with the\nSolar Dynamics Observatory Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (SDO/AIA). The proposed\nmethod detects coronal boundaries without determining any fixed intensity value\nin the data. Instead, the active contour segmentation employs an\nenergy-minimization in which coronal holes are assumed to have more homogeneous\nintensities than surrounding active regions and quiet Sun. The segmented\ncoronal holes tend to correspond to unipolar magnetic regions, are consistent\nwith concurrent solar wind observations, and qualitatively match the coronal\nholes segmented by other methods. The means to identify a coronal hole without\nspecification of a final intensity threshold may allow this algorithm to be\nmore robust across multiple datasets, regardless of data type, resolution, and\nquality.\n", "  In this paper, we construct and investigate two supersymmetric versions of\nthe Fokas-Gel'fand formula for the immersion of 2D surfaces associated with a\nsupersymmetric integrable system. The first version involves an infinitesimal\ndeformation of the zero-curvature condition and the linear spectral problem\nassociated with this system. This deformation leads the surfaces to be\nrepresented in terms of a bosonic supermatrix immersed in a Lie superalgebra.\nThe second supersymmetric version is obtained by using a fermionic parameter\ndeformation to construct surfaces expressed in terms of a fermionic supermatrix\nimmersed in a Lie superalgebra. For both extensions, we provide a geometrical\ncharacterization of deformed surfaces using the super Killing form as an inner\nproduct and a super moving frame formalism. The theoretical results are applied\nto the supersymmetric sine-Gordon equation in order to construct super soliton\nsurfaces associated with five different symmetries. We find integrated forms of\nthese surfaces which represent constant Gaussian curvature surfaces and\nnonlinear Weingarten-type surfaces.\n", "  We present our progress on the study of extinction laws along three diferent\nlines. [a] We compare how well different families of extinction laws fit\nexisting photometric data for Galactic sightlines and we find that the Ma\\'iz\nApell\\'aniz et al. (2014) family provides better results than those of Cardelli\net al. (1989) or Fitzpatrick (1999). [b] We describe the HST/STIS\nspectrophotometry in the 1700-10 200 Angstrom range that we are obtaining for\nseveral tens of sightlines in 30 Doradus with the purpose of deriving an\nimproved wavelength-detailed family of extinction laws. [c] We present the\nstudy we are conducting on the behavior of the extinction law in the infrared\nby combining 2MASS and WISE photometry with Spitzer and ISO spectrophotometry.\n", "  Particle number fluctuations are considered within the van der Waals (VDW)\nequation, which contains both attractive (mean-field) and repulsive\n(eigenvolume) interactions. The VDW equation is used to calculate the scaled\nvariance of particle number fluctuations in generic Boltzmann VDW system and in\nnuclear matter. The strongly intensive measures $\\Delta[E^*,N]$ and\n$\\Sigma[E^*,N]$ of the particle number and excitation energy fluctuations are\nalso considered, and, similarly, show singular behavior near the critical\npoint. The $\\Delta[E^*,N]$ measure is shown to attain both positive and\nnegative values in the vicinity of critical point. Based on universality\nargument, similar behavior is expected to occur in the vicinity of the QCD\ncritical point.\n", "  We demonstrate experimentally that a broad area laser-like optical oscillator\n(a nondegenerate photorefractive oscillator) with structured injected signal\ndisplays two-phase patterns. The technique (G. J. de Valc\\'arcel and K.\nStaliunas, Phys. Rev. Lett. (105), 054101 (2010)) consists in spatially\nmodulating the injection, so that its phase alternates periodically between two\nopposite values, i.e. differing by pi\n", "  A new strategy for eliminating photocurrent losses due to the metal contacts\non the front of a solar cell was proposed, simulated, and tested. By placing\ntriangular cross-section lines of low refractive index on top of the contacts,\ntotal-internal reflection at the interface of the low-index triangles and the\nsurrounding material can direct light away from the metal and into the\nphotoactive absorber. Simulations indicated that losses can be eliminated for\nany incident angle, and that yearly energy production improvements commensurate\nwith the metallized area are possible. Proof of principle experiments were\ncarried out to eliminate the reflective losses of a commercial solar cell's\nbusbar contact. Spatially resolved laser beam induced current measurements\ndemonstrated that reflection losses due to the busbar were reduced by voids\nwith triangular cross-section.\n", "  Iron spin transition directly affects properties of lower mantle minerals and\ncan thus alter geophysical and geochemical characteristics of the deep Earth.\nWhile the spin transition in ferropericlase has been vigorously established at\nP ~ 60 GPa and 300 K, experimental evidence for spin transitions in other\nrock-forming minerals, such as bridgmanite and post-perovskite, remains\ncontroversial. Multiple valence, spin, and coordination states of iron in\nbridgmanite and post-perovskite are difficult to resolve with conventional\nspin-probing techniques. Optical spectroscopy, on the other hand, is sensitive\nto high/low spin ferrous/ferric iron at different sites; thus, it can be a\npowerful probe for spin transitions. Here we establish the optical signature of\nlow spin Fe3+O6, a plausible low spin unit in bridgmanite and post-perovskite,\nby optical absorption experiments in diamond anvil cells. We show that the\noptical absorption of Fe3+O6 in NAL (new aluminous phase) is very sensitive to\nthe iron spin state and represents a model behavior of bridgmanite and\npost-perovskite in the deep lower mantle across a spin transition.\nSpecifically, an absorption band centered at ~ 19000 cm-1 is characteristic of\nthe 2T2g to 2T1g (2A2g) transition in low spin Fe3+ in NAL at 40 GPa. This new\nspectroscopic information constrains the crystal field splitting energy of low\nspin Fe3+ to ~ 22200 cm-1 which we also independently confirm by our\nfirst-principles calculations. Together with available information on the\nelectronic structure of Fe3+O6-compounds, we constrain the spin-pairing energy\nof Fe3+ in an octahedral field to ~ 20000-23000 cm-1. This implies that\noctahedrally-coordinated Fe3+ in bridgmanite is low spin at P > ~ 40 GPa.\n", "  A numerical algorithm that computes the decomposition of a finite-dimensional\nunitary reducible representation of a compact Lie group is presented. The\nalgorithm, inspired by notions of quantum mechanics, generates two adapted\nstates and, after appropriate algebraic manipulations, returns the block matrix\nstructure of the representation in terms of its irreducible components. It also\nprovides an adapted orthonormal basis. The algorithm can be used to compute the\nClebsch--Gordan coefficients of the tensor product of irreducible\nrepresentations of a given compact Lie group. The performance of the algorithm\nis tested on various examples: the decomposition of the regular representation\nof finite groups and the computation of the Clebsch--Gordan coefficients of\ntensor products of representations of SU(2).\n", "  Proofs of the security of quantum key distribution are propositions about\nmodels written in the mathematical language of quantum mechanics, and the issue\nis the linking of such models to actual devices in an experiment on security.\nTo explore this issue, we adapt Wittgenstein's method of language games to view\nquantum language in its application to experimental activity involving\ntransmitting and receiving devices.\n  We sketch concepts with which to think about models in relation to\nexperiments, without assuming the experiments accord with any model included is\na concept of one quantum-mechanical model enveloping another. For any model\nthat agrees with given experimental results and implies the security of a key,\nthere is an enveloping model that agrees with the same results while denying\nthat security. As a result there is a gap between equations and the behavior\nrecorded from devices in an experiment, a gap bridged only by resort to\nsomething beyond the reach of logic and measured data, well named by the word\nguesswork.\n  While this recognition of guesswork encourages eavesdropping, a related\nrecognition of guesswork in the design of feedback loops can help a transmitter\nand receiver to reduce their vulnerability to eavesdropping.\n", "  The simulation of problems in kinetic plasma physics are often challenging\ndue to strongly coupled phenomena across multiple scales. In this work, we\npropose a wavelet-based coarse-grained numerical scheme, based on the framework\nof Equation-Free Projective Integration, for a kinetic plasma system modeled by\nthe Vlasov-Poisson equations. A kinetic particle-in-cell (PIC) code is used to\nsimulate the meso scale dynamics for short time intervals. This allows the\nextrapolation over long time-steps of the behavior of a coarse wavelet-based\ndiscretization of the system. To validate the approach and the underlying\nconcepts, we perform two 1D1V numerical experiments: nonlinear propagation and\nsteepening of an ion wave, and the expansion of a plasma slab in vacuum. The\ndirect comparisons to resolved PIC simulations show good agreement. We show\nthat the speedup of the projective integration scheme over the full particle\nscheme scales linearly with the system size, demonstrating efficiency while\ntaking into account fully kinetic, non-Maxwellian effects. This suggests that\nthe approach is potentially interesting for kinetic plasma problems with a\nlarge separation of scales, especially in higher dimensions.\n", "  When massless excitations are limited or modified by the presence of material\nbodies one observes a force acting between them generally called Casimir force.\nSuch excitations are present in any fluid system close to its true bulk\ncritical point. We derive exact analytical results for both the temperature and\nexternal ordering field behavior of the thermodynamic Casimir force within the\nmean-field Ginzburg-Landau Ising type model of a simple fluid or binary liquid\nmixture. We investigate the case when under a film geometry the boundaries of\nthe system exhibit strong adsorption onto one of the phases (components) of the\nsystem. We present analytical and numerical results for the (temperature-field)\nrelief map of the force in both the critical region of the film close to its\nfinite-size or bulk critical points as well as in the capillary condensation\nregime below but close to the finite-size critical point.\n", "  We consider quantum formalism limited by the classical simulating computer\nwith the fixed memory. The memory is redistributed in the course of modeling by\nthe variation of the set of classical states and the accuracy of the\nrepresentation of amplitudes. This computational description completely\npreserves the conventional formalism and does not contradicts to experiments,\nbut it makes impossible fast quantum algorithms. This description involves the\nslow down of quantum evolutions with the growth of the dimension of the minimal\nsubspace containing entangled states, which arise in the evolution. This slow\ndown is the single difference of the proposed formalism from the standard one;\nit is negligible for the systems from the usual experiments, including those in\nwhich many entangled particle participate, but grows rapidly in the attempt to\nrealize the scalable quantum computations, which require the unlimited\nparallelism. The experimental verification of this version of quantum formalism\nis reduced to the fixation of this slow down.\n", "  In Hamiltonian systems subjected to periodic perturbations the stable and\nunstable manifolds of the unstable periodic orbits provide the dynamical\n\"skeleton\" that drives the mixing process and bounds the chaotic regions of the\nphase space. Determining the behavior of these objects is valuable in physical\napplications involving asymmetric solenoidal fields or time-dependent\nHamiltonian systems. Here we introduce a simple method to calculate an unstable\nperiodic orbit given an initial guess on its position. Then we present an\nefficient adaptive method to build its high-resolution invariant manifolds to\narbitrary length and compare it to a random sampling method with the same\ncomputational cost. The adaptive method gives a high-quality representation of\nthe manifolds and reveals fine details that become lost in the random sampling\nmethod. Finally, we introduce an approximation to the adaptive method to build\nthe manifolds avoiding redundant calculations and reducing logarithmically the\nnumber of computations needed to represent these surfaces.\n", "  The impact of Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) for providing situational\nawareness to transmission system operators has been widely documented.\nMicro-PMUs ($\\mu$PMUs) are an emerging sensing technology that can provide\nsimilar benefits to Distribution System Operators (DSOs), enabling a level of\nvisibility into the distribution grid that was previously unattainable. In\norder to support the deployment of these high resolution sensors, the\nautomation of data analysis and prioritizing communication to the DSO becomes\ncrucial. In this paper, we explore the use of $\\mu$PMUs to detect anomalies on\nthe distribution grid. Our methodology is motivated by growing concern about\nfailures and attacks to distribution automation equipment. The effectiveness of\nour approach is demonstrated through both real and simulated data.\n", "  We present a strongly-coupled immersed-boundary method for flow-structure\ninteraction problems involving thin deforming bodies. The method is stable for\narbitrary choices of solid-to-fluid mass ratios and for large body motions. As\nwith many strongly-coupled immersed-boundary methods, our method requires the\nsolution of a nonlinear algebraic system at each time step. The system is\nsolved through iteration, where the iterates are obtained by linearizing the\nsystem and performing a block LU factorization. This restricts all iterations\nto small-dimensional subsystems that scale with the number of discretization\npoints on the immersed surface, rather than on the entire flow domain.\nMoreover, the iteration procedure we propose does not involve heuristic\nregularization parameters, and has converged in a small number of iterations\nfor all problems we have considered. We derive our method for general deforming\nsurfaces, and verify the method with two-dimensional test problems of\ngeometrically nonlinear beams undergoing large amplitude flapping behavior.\n", "  Operators for simulating the scattering of two particles with spin are\nconstructed. Three methods are shown to give the consistent lattice operators\nfor PN, PV, VN and NN scattering, where P, V and N denote pseudoscalar meson,\nvector meson and nucleon. The projection method leads to one or several\noperators $O_{\\Gamma,r,n}$ that transform according to a given irreducible\nrepresentation $\\Gamma$ and row r. However, it gives little guidance on which\ncontinuum quantum numbers of total J, spin S, orbital momentum L or\nsingle-particle helicities $\\lambda_{1,2}$ will be related with a given\noperator. This is remedied with the helicity and partial-wave methods. There\nfirst the operators with good continuum quantum numbers $(J,P,\\lambda_{1,2})$\nor $(J,L,S)$ are constructed and then subduced to the irreps $\\Gamma$ of the\ndiscrete lattice group. The results indicate which linear combinations\n$O_{\\Gamma,r,n}$ of various n have to be employed in the simulations in order\nto enhance couplings to the states with desired continuum quantum numbers. The\ntotal momentum of two hadrons is restricted to zero since parity P is a good\nquantum number in this case.\n", "  Bohmian mechanics is a theory that provides a consistent explanation of\nquantum phenomena in terms of point particles whose motion is guided by the\nwave function. In this theory, the state of a system of particles is defined by\nthe actual positions of the particles and the wave function of the system; and\nthe state of the system evolves deterministically. Thus, the Bohmian state can\nbe compared with the state in classical mechanics, which is given by the\npositions and momenta of all the particles, and which also evolves\ndeterministically. However, while in classical mechanics it is usually taken\nfor granted and considered unproblematic that the state is, at least in\nprinciple, measurable, this is not the case in Bohmian mechanics. Due to the\nlinearity of the quantum dynamical laws, one essential component of the Bohmian\nstate, the wave function, is not directly measurable. Moreover, it turns out\nthat the measurement of the other component of the state -the positions of the\nparticles- must be mediated by the wave function; a fact that in turn implies\nthat the positions of the particles, though measurable, are constrained by\nabsolute uncertainty. This is the key to understanding how Bohmian mechanics,\ndespite being deterministic, can account for all quantum predictions, including\nquantum randomness and uncertainty.\n", "  The notion of (auto) catalytic networks has become a cornerstone in\nunderstanding the possibility of a sudden dramatic increase of diversity in\nbiological evolution as well as in the evolution of social and economical\nsystems. Here we study catalytic random networks with respect to the final\noutcome diversity of products. We show that an analytical treatment of this\nlongstanding problem is possible by mapping the problem onto a set of\nnon-linear recurrence equations. The solution of these equations show a crucial\ndependence of the final number of products on the initial number of products\nand the density of catalytic production rules. For a fixed density of rules we\ncan demonstrate the existence of a phase transition from a practically\nunpopulated regime to a fully populated and diverse one. The order parameter is\nthe number of final products. We are able to further understand the origin of\nthis phase transition as a crossover from one set of solutions from a quadratic\nequation to the other.\n", "  The standard model of cosmology is based on the hot Big Bang theory and the\ninflationary paradigm. Recent precise observations of the temperature and\npolarization anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background and the matter\ndistribution in large scale structures like galaxies and clusters confirm the\ngeneral paradigm and put severe constrains on variations of this simple idea.\nIn this essay I will discuss the epistemological foundations of such a paradigm\nand speculate on its possible realisation within a more fundamental theory.\n", "  We study the dynamical Myers effect by allowing the fuzzy (or the dynamical\ndielectric brane) coordinates to be time dependent. We find three novel kinds\nof the dynamical spherical dielectric branes depending on their respective\nexcess energies. The first represents a dynamical spherical brane carrying a\nnegative excess energy (having a lower bound) with its radius oscillating\nperiodically between two given non-zero values. The second is the one with zero\nexcess energy and whose time dependence can be expressed in terms of a simple\nfunction. This particular dynamical spherical configuration represents the\ndielectric brane creation and/or annihilation like a photon in the presence of\na background creating an electron-position pair and then annihilating back to a\nphoton. The third is the one carrying positive excess energy and the radius can\nalso oscillate periodically between two non-zero values but, unlike the first\nkind, it passes zero twice for each cycle. Each of the above can also be\ninterpreted as the time evolution of a semi-spherical D-brane--anti\nsemi-spherical D-brane system.\n", "  This survey summarizes briefly results obtained recently in the Casimir\nenergy studies devoted to the following subjects: i) account of the material\ncharacteristics of the media in calculations of the vacuum energy (for example,\nCasimir energy of a dilute dielectric ball); ii) application of the spectral\ngeometry methods for investigating the vacuum energy of quantized fields with\nthe goal to gain some insight, specifically, in the geometrical origin of the\ndivergences that enter the vacuum energy and to develop the relevant\nrenormalization procedure; iii) a universal method for calculating the high\ntemperature dependence of the Casimir energy in terms of heat kernel\ncoefficients. A special attention is payed to the mathematical tools applied in\nthis field, namely, to the spectral zeta function method and heat kernel\ntechnique.\n"]}
