DPD particles are often thought to represent\npackets of real atoms, and the physical scale probed in DPD models are\ndetermined by the mapping of DPD variables to the corresponding physical\nquantities. However, the non-uniqueness of such mapping has led to difficulties\nin setting up simulations to mimic real systems and in interpreting results.\nFor modeling transport phenomena where thermal fluctuations are important\n(e.g., fluctuating hydrodynamics), an area particularly suited for DPD method,\nwe propose that DPD fluid particles should be viewed as only 1) to provide a\nmedium in which the momentum and energy are transferred according to the\nhydrodynamic laws and 2) to provide objects immersed in the DPD fluids the\nproper random \"kicks\" such that these objects exhibit correct fluctuation\nbehaviors at the macroscopic scale. We show that, in such a case, the choice of\nsystem temperature and mapping of DPD scales to physical scales are uniquely\ndetermined by the level of coarse-graining and properties of DPD fluids. We\nalso verified that DPD simulation can reproduce the macroscopic effects of\nthermal fluctuation in particulate suspension by showing that the Brownian\ndiffusion of solid particles can be computed in DPD simulations with good\naccuracy.\n", "  The lifetime of localized surface plasmon plays an important role in many\naspects of plasmonics and its applications. In small metal nanostructures, the\ndominant mechanism restricting plasmon lifetime is size-dependent Landau\ndamping. We performed quantum-mechanical calculations of Landau damping for the\nbright surface plasmon mode in a metal nanoshell. In contrast to the\nconventional model based on the electron surface scattering, we found that the\ndamping rate decreases as the nanoshell thickness is reduced. The origin of\nthis behavior is traced to the spatial distribution of plasmon local field\ninside the metal shell. We also found that, due to interference of electron\nscattering amplitudes from nanoshell's two metal surfaces, the damping rate\nexhibits pronounced quantum beats with changing shell thickness.\n", "  I describe composite pulses during which the average dipolar interactions\nwithin a spin ensemble are controlled while realizing a global rotation. The\nconstruction method used is based on the average Hamiltonian theory and rely on\nthe geometrical properties of the spin-spin dipolar interaction only. I present\nseveral such composite pulses robust against standard experimental defects in\nNRM: static or radio-frequency field miscalibration, fields inhomogeneities.\nNumerical simulations show that the magic sandwich pulse sequence, a pulse\nsequence that reverse the average dipolar field while applied, is plagued by\ndefects originating from its short initial and final \\pi/2 radio-frequency\npulses. Using the magic composite pulses instead of \\pi/2 pulses improves the\nmagic sandwich effect. A numerical test using a classical description of NMR\nallows to check the validity of the magic composite pulses and estimate their\nefficiency.\n", "  Carrier-dopant exchange interactions in Mn-doped PbS colloidal quantum dots\nwere studied by circularly polarized magneto-photoluminescence. Mn\nsubstitutional doping leads to paramagnetic behavior down to 5 K. While undoped\nquantum dots show negative circular polarization, Mn doping changes its sign to\npositive. A circular polarization value of 40% was achieved at T=7 K and B=7\ntesla. The results are interpreted in terms of Zeeman splitting of the band\nedge states in the presence of carrier-dopant exchange interactions that are\nqualitatively different from the s,p-d exchange interactions in II-VI systems.\n", "  Herein, we examined the dependence of protein adsorption on the nanoparticle\nsurface in the presence of functional groups. Our UV-visible spectrophotometry,\ntransmission electron microscopy, infrared spectroscopy and dynamic light\nscattering measurements evidently suggested that the functional groups play an\nimportant role in the formation of nanoparticle-protein corona. We found that\nuncoated and surfactant-free silver nanoparticles derived from a laser ablation\nprocess promoted a maximum protein (bovine serum albumin) coating due to\nincreased changes in entropy. On the other hand, BSA displayed a lower affinity\nfor electrostatically stabilized nanoparticles due to the constrained entropy\nchanges.\n", "  We reproduce patterns of drying paste by means of smoothed particle\nhydrodynamics which is the one of methods for solving the equations of\ncontinuum in the Lagrangian description. In addition to reproduce a realistic\npattern, we find that average size of fragments decays in proportion to inverse\ntime in the case of a linear drying process. Distributions of the size of the\nfragments are obtained depending on the time. We find a universal scaling\ndistribution by scaling analysis with the average size of the fragment.\n", "  We discuss optical absorption in topological insulators and study possible\nphotoelectric effects theoretically. We found that absorption of circularly\npolarized electromagnetic waves in two-dimensional topological insulators\nresults in electric current in the conducting 1D edge channels, the direction\nof the current being determined by the light polarization. We suggest two ways\nof inducing such a current: due to magnetic dipole electron transitions\nstimulated by irradiation of frequency below the bulk energy gap, and due to\nelectric dipole transitions in the bulk at frequencies larger than the energy\ngap with subsequent capture of the photogenerated carriers on conducting edge\nstates.\n", "  A candidate parameterization is introduced, in an effective field theory\nframework, for the quantum information transfer from a black hole that is\nnecessary to restore unitarity. This in particular allows description of the\neffects of this information transfer in the black hole atmosphere, for example\nseen by infalling observers. In the presence of such information transfer, it\nis shown that infalling observers need not experience untoward violence.\nMoreover, the presence of general moderate-frequency couplings to field modes\nwith high angular momenta offers a mechanism to enhance information transfer\nrates, commensurate with the increased energy flux, when a string is introduced\nto \"mine\" a black hole. Generic such models for nonviolent information transfer\npredict extra energy flux from a black hole, beyond that of Hawking.\n", "  We study inclusive dijet azimuthal decorrelations in proton-proton collisions\nat the CERN LHC invoking the hypothesis of parton Reggeization in t-channel\nexchanges at high energies. In the parton Reggeization approach, the main\ncontribution to the azimuthal angle difference between the two most energetic\njets is due to the Reggeon-Reggeon-Particle-Particle scattering, when the\nfusion of two Reggeized gluons into a pair of Yang-Mills gluons dominates.\nUsing a high-energy factorization scheme with the Kimber-Martin-Ryskin\nunintegrated parton distribution functions and the Fadin-Lipatov effective\nvertices we obtain good agreement of our calculations with recent measurements\nby the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations at the CERN LHC.\n", "  Inorganic salts are a natural component of biomass which have a significant\neffect on the product yields from a variety of biomass conversion processes.\nUnderstanding their effect on biomass at the microscopic level can help\ndiscover their mechanistic role. We present a study of the effect of aqueous\nsodium chloride (NaCl) on the largest component of biomass, cellulose, focused\non the thermodynamic and structural effect of a sodium ion on the cellulose\ntetramer, and fibril. Replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations of a\ncellulose tetramer reveal a number of preferred cellulose-Na contacts and\nbridging positions. Large scale MD simulations on a model cellulose fibril find\nthat Na+ perturbs the hydroxymethyl rotational state population and\nconsequently disrupts the \"native\" hydrogen bonding network.\n", "  We use the 1+1+2 covariant approach to clarify a number of aspects of\nspherically symmetric solutions of non-minimally coupled scalar tensor\ntheories. Particular attention is focused on the extension of Birkhoff's\ntheorem and the nature of quasi-local horizons in this context.\n", "  Sunspot area data play an important role in the studies of solar activity and\nits long-term variations. In order to reveal real long-term solar variations\nprecise homogeneous sunspot area databases should be used. However, the\nmeasured areas may be burdened with systematic deviations, which may vary in\ntime. Thus, there is a need to investigate the long-term variation of sunspot\narea datasets and to determine the time-dependent cross-calibration factors. In\nthis study, we investigate the time-dependent differences between the available\nlong-term sunspot databases. Using the results, we estimate the correction\nfactor to calibrate the corrected daily sunspot areas of Debrecen\nPhotoheliographic Data (DPD) to the same data of Greenwich Photoheliographic\nResults (GPR) by using the overlapping Kislovodsk and Pulkovo data. We give the\ncorrection factor as GPR=1.08(\\pm 0.11)*DPD\n", "  A transformation group approach to the prior for the parameters of the beta\ndistribution is suggested which accounts for finite sets of data by imposing a\nlimit to the range of parameter values under consideration. The relationship\nbetween the beta distribution and the Poisson and gamma distributions in the\ncontinuum is explored, with an emphasis on the decomposition of the model into\nseparate estimates for size and shape. Use of the beta distribution in\nclassification and prediction problems is discussed, and the effect of the\nprior on the analysis of some well known examples from statistical genetics is\nexamined.\n", "  We study random-field xy spin model at T=0 numerically on lattices of up to\n1000 x 1000 x 1000 spins with the accent on the weak random field. Our\nnumerical method is physically equivalent to slow cooling in which the system\nis gradually losing the energy and relaxing to an energy minimum. The system\nshows glass properties, the resulting spin states depending strongly on the\ninitial conditions. Random initial condition for the spins leads to the vortex\nglass (VG) state with short-range spin-spin correlations defined by the average\ndistance between vortex lines. Collinear and some other vortex-free initial\nconditions result in the vortex-free ferromagnetic (F) states that have a lower\nenergy. The energy difference between the F and VG states correlates with\nvorticity of the VG state. Correlation functions in the F states agree with the\nLarkin-Imry-Ma theory at short distances. Hysteresis curves for weak random\nfield are dominated by topologically stable spin walls raptured by vortex\nloops. We find no relaxation paths from the F, VG, or any other states to the\nhypothetical vortex-free state with zero magnetization.\n", "  We report unconventional thermopower (Seebeck coefficient, $S$) behavior of\n$L1_{0}$ FePt films. The electron diffusion and magnon scattering are found to\nbe the major contributions to the thermopower at low temperatures. The\ntemperature dependence of $S$ is fitted by a phenomenological expression. The\nextracted electron diffusion coefficient is positive, instead of negative for\nconventional metals. An overall concave curvature of the Fermi surface specific\nto FePt is found to be responsible. More interestingly, the magnon drag\ncoefficient carries an opposite sign to that of electron diffusion, suggesting\ndominant contribution from electron-magnon umklapp scattering. DFT calculations\nidentify several bands crossing the Brillouin zone boundaries, facilitating the\numklapp process. The large spin-orbit coupling in FePt results in strong mixing\nof majority and minority spins among two of those bands, greatly enhancing the\nelectron-magnon scattering.\n", "  We report Bessel-like beam formation of acoustic waves by means of an\naxisymmetric grating of rigid tori. The results show that the generated beam\npattern is similar to that of Bessel beams, characterized by elongated\nnon-diffracting focal spots. A multiple foci structure is observed, due to the\nfinite size of the lens. The dependence of the focal distance on the frequency\nis also discussed, on the basis of an extended grating theory. Experimental\nvalidation of acoustic Bessel-like beam formation is also reported for sound\nwaves. The results can be generalized to wave beams of different nature, as\noptical or matter waves.\n", "  Reformulation of conventional beam definitions into their bidirectional\nversions and use of Hertz potentials make beam fields exact vector solutions to\nMaxwell's equations. This procedure is applied to higher-order elegant\nLaguerre-Gaussian beams of TM and TE polarization. Their vortex and anti-vortex\nco-axial compositions of equal and opposite topological charges are given in a\nclosed analytic form. Polarization components of the composed beams are\nspecified by their radial and azimuthal indices. The longitudinal components\nare common for beam compositions of both types, meanwhile their transverse\ncomponents are different and comprise two - nonparaxial and paraxial - separate\nparts distinguished by a paraxial parameter and its inverse, respectively. The\nnew solutions may appear useful in modelling and tailoring of arbitrary vector\nbeams.\n", "  The Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI) has\nobserved more than 80,000 solar energetic events since its launch on February\n$12^{\\rm th}$, 2002. Using this large sample of observed flares, we studied the\nspatio-temporal relationship between succeeding flares. Our results show that\nthe statistical relationship between the temporal and spatial differences of\nsucceeding flares can be described as a power law of the form $R(t)\\sim t^p$\nwith $p=0.327\\pm 0.007$. We discuss the possible interpretations of this result\nas a characteristic function of a supposed underlying physics. Different\nscenarios are considered to explain this relation, including the case where the\nconnectivity between succeeding events is realised through a shock wave in the\npost Sedov-Taylor phase or where the spatial and temporal relationship between\nflares is supposed to be provided by an expanding flare area in the\nsub-diffusive regime. Furthermore, we cannot exclude the possibility that the\nphysical process behind the statistical relationship is the reordering of the\nmagnetic field by the flare or it is due to some unknown processes.\n", "  We report numerical investigation of the glassy behavior of random-field\nexchange models in three dimensions. Correlation of energy with the\nmagnetization for different numbers of spin components has been studied. There\nis a profound difference between the models with two and three spin components\nwith respect to the stability of the magnetized state due to the different\nkinds of singularities: vortex loops and hedgehogs, respectively. Memory\neffects pertinent to such states have been investigated. Insight into the\nmechanism of the large-scale disordering is provided by numerically\nimplementing the Imry-Ma argument in which the spins follow the random field\naveraged over correlated volumes. Thermal stability of the magnetized states is\ninvestigated by the Monte Carlo method.\n", "  In this monograph, we develop results on global existence and convergence of\nsolutions to abstract gradient flows on Banach spaces for a potential function\nthat obeys the Lojasiewicz-Simon gradient inequality. We prove a\nLojasiewicz-Simon gradient inequality for the Yang-Mills energy functional over\nclosed, smooth Riemannian manifolds of arbitrary dimension and apply the\nresulting framework to prove new results for the gradient flow equation for the\nYang-Mills energy functional on a principal bundle, with compact Lie structure\ngroup, over a closed, smooth Riemannian manifolds, including the following. If\nthe initial connection is close enough to a local minimum of the Yang-Mills\nenergy functional, in a norm sense when the base manifold has arbitrary\ndimension or in an energy sense when the base manifold has dimension four, then\nthe Yang-Mills gradient flow exists for all time and converges to a Yang-Mills\nconnection. If the initial connection is allowed to have arbitrary energy but\nwe restrict to the setting of a Hermitian vector bundle over a compact,\ncomplex, Hermitian (but not necessarily Kaehler) surface and the initial\nconnection has curvature of type (1,1), then the Yang-Mills gradient flow\nexists for all time, though bubble singularities may (and in certain cases\nmust) occur in the limit as time tends to infinity.\n", "  The period of a Morse oscillator and mathematical pendulum system are\nobtained, accurate to 100 significant digits, by forward period analysis (FPA).\nFrom these results, the long-term [0, 10^60] (time unit) solutions, which\noverlap from the Planck time to the age of the universe, are computed reliably\nand quickly with a parallel multiple-precision Taylor series (PMT) scheme. The\napplication of FPA to periodic systems can reduce the computation loops of\nlong-term reliable simulation from O(t^(1+1/M)) to O(lnt+t/h0) where T is the\nperiod, M the order and h0 a constant step-size. This scheme provides a way to\ngenerate reference solutions to test other schemes' long-term simulations.\n", "  We investigate the stability of massless topological black holes in AdS_d\nwhen minimally coupled to a scalar field of negative mass-squared. In many\ncases such black holes are unstable even though the field is above the BF bound\nand the geometry is locally AdS. The instability depends on the choice of\nboundary conditions for the scalars: scalars with non-standard (Neumann)\nboundary conditions tend to be more unstable, though scalars with standard\n(Dirichlet) boundary conditions can be unstable as well. This leads to an\napparent mismatch between boundary and bulk results in the Vasiliev/Vector-like\nmatter duality.\n", "  The study of active region tilt angles and their variations in different time\nscales plays an important role in revealing the subsurface dynamics of magnetic\nflux ropes and in understanding the dynamo mechanism. In order to reveal the\nexact characteristics of tilt angles, precise long-term tilt angle data bases\nare needed. However, there are only a few different data sets at present, which\nare difficult to be compared and cross-calibrate because of their substantial\ndeviations. In this paper, we describe new tilt angle data bases derived from\nthe Debrecen Photoheliographic Data ($DPD$) (1974--) and from the\nSOHO/MDI-Debrecen Data ($SDD$) (1996-2010) sunspot catalogues. We compare them\nwith the traditional sunspot group tilt angle data bases of Mount Wilson\nObservatory (1917-85) and Kodaikanal Solar Observatory (1906-87) and we analyse\nthe deviations. Various methods and filters are investigated which may improve\nthe sample of data and may help deriving better results based on combined data.\nAs a demonstration of the enhanced quality of the improved data set a refined\ndiagram of the Joy's law is presented.\n", "  We report on the feasibility of assessing single-grain dose-distributions by\nusing an EMCCD-based imaging system with complementary analysis software.\nAutomated image-processing was successfully applied to compensate sample motion\nand for automated grain identification. Following a dose recovery test, 74 % of\nthe grains were recognized successfully, and 44 % exhibited a suitable OSL dose\nresponse behavior to interpolate an equivalent dose value and a central dose\nrecovery ratio of 1.038 was obtained.\n", "  We present a new type of transmon split-junction qubit which can be tuned by\nMeissner screening currents in the adjacent superconducting film electrodes.\nThe best detected relaxation time ($T_1$) was of the order of 50 $\\mu$s and the\ndephasing time ($T_2$) about 40 $\\mu$s. The achieved period of oscillation with\nmagnetic field was much smaller than in usual SQUID-based transmon qubits, thus\na strong effective field amplification has been realized. This Meissner qubit\nallows an efficient coupling to superconducting vortices. We present a\nquantitative analysis of the radiation-free energy relaxation in qubits coupled\nto Abrikosov vortices. The observation of coherent quantum oscillations\nprovides strong evidence that vortices can exist in coherent quantum\nsuperpositions of different position states. According to our suggested model,\nthe wave function collapse is defined by Caldeira-Leggett dissipation\nassociated with viscous motion of the vortex cores.\n", "  We analyze site percolation on directed and undirected graphs with\nsite-dependent open-site probabilities. We construct upper bounds on cluster\nsusceptibilities, vertex connectivity functions, and the expected number of\nsimple open cycles through a chosen arc; separate bounds are given on finite\nand infinite (di)graphs. These produce lower bounds for percolation and\nuniqueness transitions in infinite (di)graphs, and for the formation of a giant\ncomponent in finite (di)graphs. The bounds are formulated in terms of\nappropriately weighted adjacency and non-backtracking (Hashimoto) matrices. It\nturns out to be the uniqueness criterion that is most closely associated with\nan asymptotically vanishing probability of forming a giant strongly-connected\ncomponent on a large finite (di)graph.\n", "  We report on updates to the accelerator controls for the Neutralized Drift\nCompression Experiment II, a pulsed induction-type accelerator for heavy ions.\nThe control infrastructure is built around a LabVIEW interface combined with an\nApache Cassandra backend for data archiving. Recent upgrades added the storing\nand retrieving of device settings into the database, as well as ZeroMQ as a\nmessage broker that replaces LabVIEW's shared variables. Converting to ZeroMQ\nalso allows easy access via other programming languages, such as Python.\n", "  A quantum annealing solver for the renowned job-shop scheduling problem (JSP)\nis presented in detail. After formulating the problem as a time-indexed\nquadratic unconstrained binary optimization problem, several pre-processing and\ngraph embedding strategies are employed to compile optimally parametrized\nfamilies of the JSP for scheduling instances of up to six jobs and six machines\non the D-Wave Systems Vesuvius processor. Problem simplifications and\npartitioning algorithms, including variable pruning and running strategies that\nconsider tailored binary searches, are discussed and the results from the\nprocessor are compared against state-of-the-art global-optimum solvers.\n", "  A time-domain numerical code based on the constitutive relations of nonlinear\nacoustics for simulating ultrasound propagation is presented. To model\nfrequency power law attenuation, such as observed in biological media, multiple\nrelaxation processes are included and relaxation parameters are fitted to both\nexact frequency power law attenuation and empirically measured attenuation of a\nvariety of tissues that does not fit an exact power law. A computational\ntechnique based on artificial relaxation is included to correct the\nnon-negligible numerical dispersion of the numerical method and to improve\nstability when shock waves are present. This technique avoids the use of high\norder finite difference schemes, leading to fast calculations. The numerical\ncode is especially suitable to study high intensity and focused axisymmetric\nacoustic beams in tissue-like medium, as it is based on the full constitutive\nrelations that overcomes the limitations of the parabolic approximations, while\nsome specific effects not contemplated by the Westervelt equation can be also\nstudied. The accuracy of the method is discussed by comparing the proposed\nsimulation solutions to one-dimensional analytical ones, to $k$-space numerical\nsolutions and also to experimental data from a focused beam propagating in a\nfrequency power law attenuation media.\n", "  Search of chiral magnetic solitons on the basis of the data on the crystal\nstructure is important from both fundamental and technological points of view.\nPotential chiral magnetic solitons - hexagonal metal formates [NH4][M(HCOO)3]\nwith M2+ = Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni and KCo(HCOO)3 containing dominating left-handed\nchiral antiferromagnetic helices that compete with interhelix interactions have\nbeen identified. The sign and strength of magnetic interactions not only\nbetween nearest neighbors, but also for longer-range neighbors in the metal\nformates have been calculated on the basis of structural data. Magnetic\nstructures of these compounds are similar to that of the chiral magnetic\nsoliton Cr1/3NbS2. The interrelation between chiral polarization of crystalline\nand magnetic structures in the metastable polymorph KCo(HCOO)3 has been\ndemonstrated.\n", "  In this article the effect of noise on Grover's algorithm is analyzed,\nmodeled as a total depolarizing channel (TDCh) and a local depolarizing channel\nin each qubit (LDCh). The focus was not in error correction (e.g. by the\nfault-tolerant method), but to provide an insight to the kind of error, or\ndegradation, that needs to be corrected. In the last years analytical results\nregarding mainly the TDCh model have been obtained. In this paper we extend\nthese previous results to the local case, concluding that the degradation of\nGrover's algorithm with the latter is worse than the former. It has been shown\nthat for both cases with an $N$-dependent small enough error-width, smaller\nthan $1/\\sqrt{N}$ for total error and $1/(\\sqrt{N}\\log_2{N})$ for the local\ncase, correction is not needed.\n", "  The propagation of intense acoustic waves in a one-dimensional phononic\ncrystal is studied. The medium consists in a structured fluid, formed by a\nperiodic array of fluid layers with alternating linear acoustic properties and\nquadratic nonlinearity coefficient. The spacing between layers is of the order\nof the wavelength, therefore Bragg effects such as band-gaps appear. We show\nthat the interplay between strong dispersion and nonlinearity leads to new\nscenarios of wave propagation. The classical waveform distortion process\ntypical of intense acoustic waves in homogeneous media can be strongly altered\nwhen nonlinearly generated harmonics lie inside or close to band gaps. This\nallows the possibility of engineer a medium in order to get a particular\nwaveform. Examples of this include the design of media with effective (e.g.\ncubic) nonlinearities, or extremely linear media (where distortion can be\ncancelled). The presented ideas open a way towards the control of acoustic wave\npropagation in nonlinear regime.\n", "  Ferrofluids show unusual hydrodynamic effects due to the magnetic nature of\ntheir constituents. For increasing magnetization a classical ferrofluid\nundergoes a Rosensweig instability and creates self-organized ordered surface\nstructures or droplet crystals. A Bose-Einstein condensate with strong dipolar\ninteractions is a quantum ferrofluid that also shows superfluidity. The field\nof dipolar quantum gases is motivated by the search for new phases that break\ncontinuous symmetries. The simultaneous breaking of continuous symmetries like\nthe phase invariance for the superfluid state and the translational symmetry\nfor a crystal provides the basis of novel states of matter. However,\ninteraction-induced crystallization in a superfluid has not been observed. Here\nwe use in situ imaging to directly observe the spontaneous transition from an\nunstructured superfluid to an ordered arrangement of droplets in an atomic\ndysprosium Bose-Einstein condensate. By utilizing a Feshbach resonance to\ncontrol the interparticle interactions, we induce a finite-wavelength\ninstability and observe discrete droplets in a triangular structure, growing\nwith increasing atom number. We find that these states are surprisingly\nlong-lived and measure a hysteretic behaviour, which is typical for a\ncrystallization process and in close analogy to the Rosensweig instability. Our\nsystem can show both superfluidity and, as shown here, spontaneous\ntranslational symmetry breaking. The presented observations do not probe\nsuperfluidity in the structured states, but if the droplets establish a common\nphase via weak links, this system is a very good candidate for a supersolid\nground state.\n", "  A general theory of preparational uncertainty relations for a quantum\nparticle in one spatial dimension is developed. We derive conditions which\ndetermine whether a given smooth function of the particle's variances and its\ncovariance is bounded from below. Whenever a global minimum exists, an\nuncertainty relation has been obtained. The squeezed number states of a\nharmonic oscillator are found to be universal: no other pure or mixed states\nwill saturate any such relation. Geometrically, we identify a convex\nuncertainty region in the space of second moments which is bounded by the\ninequality derived by Robertson and Schr\\\"{o}dinger. Our approach not only\nunifies existing uncertainty relations but also leads to new inequalities for\nsecond moments.\n", "  Following earlier findings, we argue that the low-$|t|$ structure in the\nelastic diffractive cone, recently reported by the TOTEM Collaboration at $8$\nTeV, is a consequence of the threshold singularity required by $t-$channel\nunitarity, such as revealed earlier at the ISR. By using simple Regge-pole\nmodels, we analyze the available data on the $pp$ elastic differential cross\nsection in a wide range of c.m. energies, namely those from ISR to LHC8,\nobtaining good fits of all datasets. This study hints at the fact that the\nnon-exponential behaviour observed at LHC8 is a recurrence of the low-$|t|$\n\"break\" phenomenon, observed in the seventies at ISR, being induced by the\npresence of a two-pion loop singularity in the Pomeron trajectory.\n", "  To characterize economic development and diagnose the economic health\ncondition, several popular indices such as gross domestic product (GDP),\nindustrial structure and income growth are widely applied. However, computing\nthese indices based on traditional economic census is usually costly and\nresources consuming, and more importantly, following a long time delay. In this\npaper, we analyzed nearly 200 million users' activities for four consecutive\nyears in the largest social network (Sina Microblog) in China, aiming at\nexploring latent relationships between the online social activities and local\neconomic status. Results indicate that online social activity has a strong\ncorrelation with local economic development and industrial structure, and more\ninterestingly, allows revealing the macro-economic structure instantaneously\nwith nearly no cost. Beyond, this work also provides a new venue to identify\nrisky signal in local economic structure.\n", "  The nonextensive thermodynamic relations are expressed under the assumption\nof temperature duality, endowing the \"physical temperature\" and the \"Lagrange\ntemperature\" in different physical sense. Based on this assumption, two sets of\nparallel Legendre transform structures are given. One is called \"physical\" set,\nand the other called \"Lagrange\" set. In these two formalisms, the thermodynamic\nquantities and the thermodynamic relations are both liked through the Tsallis\nfactor. Application of the two sets of the thermodynamic relations to the\nself-gravitating system shows that the heat capacity defined in the classical\nthermodynamics has no relevance to the stability of the system. Instead, the\nnew defined heat capacity can determine the stability of the system.\n", "  We study a system-bath description in the strong coupling regime where it is\nnot possible to derive a master equation for the reduced density matrix by a\ndirect expansion in the system-bath coupling. A particular example is a bath\nwith significant spectral weight at low frequencies. Through a unitary\ntransformation it can be possible to find a more suitable small expansion\nparameter. Within such approach we construct a formally exact expansion of the\nmaster equation on the Keldysh contour. We consider a system diagonally coupled\nto a bosonic bath and expansion in terms of a non-diagonal hopping term. The\nlowest-order expansion is equivalent to the so-called $P(E)$-theory or\nnon-interacting blip approximation (NIBA). The analysis of the higher-order\ncontributions shows that there are two different classes of higher-order\ndiagrams. We study how the convergence of this expansion depends on the form of\nthe spectral function with significant weight at zero frequency.\n", "  We present the first application of a new foreground removal pipeline to the\ncurrent leading HI intensity mapping dataset, obtained by the Green Bank\nTelescope (GBT). We study the 15hr and 1hr field data of the GBT observations\npreviously presented in Masui et al (2013) and Switzer et al (2013), covering\nabout 41 square degrees at 0.6<z<1.0, for which cross-correlations may be\nmeasured with the galaxy distribution of the WiggleZ Dark Energy Survey. In the\npresented pipeline, we subtract the Galactic foreground continuum and the point\nsource contamination using an independent component analysis technique\n(fastica), and develop a Fourier-based optimal estimator to compute the\ntemperature power spectrum of the intensity maps and cross-correlation with the\ngalaxy survey data. We show that fastica is a reliable tool to subtract diffuse\nand point-source emission through the non-Gaussian nature of their probability\ndistributions. The temperature power spectra of the intensity maps is dominated\nby instrumental noise on small scales which fastica, as a conservative\nsubtraction technique of non-Gaussian signals, can not mitigate. However, we\ndetermine similar GBT-WiggleZ cross-correlation measurements to those obtained\nby the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) method, and confirm that foreground\nsubtraction with fastica is robust against 21cm signal loss, as seen by the\nconverged amplitude of these cross-correlation measurements. We conclude that\nSVD and fastica are complementary methods to investigate the foregrounds and\nnoise systematics present in intensity mapping datasets.\n", "  We investigate, via Brownian dynamics simulations, the reaction dynamics of a\nsimple, non-linear chemical network (the Willamowski-Rossler network) under\nspatial confinement and crowding conditions. Our results show that the presence\nof inert crowders has a non-nontrivial effect on the dynamics of the network\nand, consequently, that effective modeling efforts aiming at a general\nunderstanding of the behavior of biochemical networks in vivo should be\nstochastic in nature and based on an explicit representation of both spatial\nconfinement and macromolecular crowding.\n", "  Disorder plays a critical role in signal transport, by controlling the\ncorrelation of systems. In wave physics, disordered potentials suppress wave\ntransport due to their localized eigenstates from random-walk scattering.\nAlthough the variation of localization with tunable disorder has been\nintensively studied as a bridge between ordered and disordered media, the\ngeneral trend of disorder-enhanced localization has remained unchanged, failing\nin envisaging the existence of delocalization in highly-disordered potentials.\nHere, we propose the concept of 'metadisorder': tunable random-walk systems\nhaving a designed eigenstate with unnatural localization. We demonstrate that\none of the eigenstates in a randomly-coupled system can always be arbitrarily\nmolded, regardless of the degree of disorder, by adjusting the self-energy of\neach element. Ordered waves are then achieved in highly-disordered systems,\nincluding planewaves and globally- collective resonances. We also devise\ncounterintuitive functionalities in disordered systems, such as\n'small-world-like' transport from non-Anderson-type localization,\nphase-conserving disorder, and phase-controlled beam steering.\n", "  Galaxy mergers produce supermassive black hole binaries, which emit\ngravitational waves prior to their coalescence. We perform three-dimensional\nhydrodynamic simulations to study the tidal disruption of stars by such a\nbinary in the final centuries of its life. We find that the gas stream of the\nstellar debris moves chaotically in the binary potential and forms accretion\ndisks around both black holes. The accretion light curve is modulated over the\nbinary orbital period owing to relativistic beaming. This periodic signal\nallows to detect the decay of the binary orbit due to gravitational wave\nemission by observing two tidal disruption events that are separated by more\nthan a decade.\n", "  In this paper, we study the age and spatial distributions of Cepheids in the\nSmall Magellanic Cloud (SMC) as a function of their ages using the data from\nthe OGLE III photometric catalogue. A period-age (PA) relation derived for the\nClassical Cepheids in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) has been used to find\nthe ages of Cepheids. The age distribution of the SMC Classical Cepheids is\nfound to have a peak at log(Age) = 8.40+/-0.10 which suggests that a major star\nformation event might have occurred in the SMC at about 250+/-50 Myrs ago. It\nis believed that this star forming burst had been triggered by close\ninteractions of the SMC with the LMC and/or the Milky Way (MW). A comparison of\nthe observed spatial distributions of the Cepheids and open star clusters has\nalso been carried out to study the star formation scenario in the SMC.\n", "  We present photometric analysis of the two W UMa type binaries identified in\nthe field of distant open star cluster NGC6866. Although these systems, namely\nID487 and ID494, were reported in the Joshi et al. (2012), but a detailed study\nof these stars has not been carried out earlier. The orbital periods of these\nstars are found to be 0.415110+/-0.000001 day and 0.366709+/-0.000004 day,\nrespectively. Based on the photometric and infrared colours, we find their\nrespective spectral types as K0 and K3. The photometric light variations of\nboth the stars show O'Connell effect which could be explained by employing a\ndark spot on the secondary components. The V and I bands light curves are\nanalyzed using the Wilson-Devinney (WD) code and relations given by Gazeas\n(2009) which yield radii and mass of the primary and secondary components of\nthe star ID487 as R1 = 1.24+/-0.01 Rsun, R2 = 1.11+/-0.02 Rsun, and M1 =\n1.24+/-0.02 Msun, M2 = 0.96+/-0.05 Msun, and for the star ID494 as R1 =\n1.22+/-0.02 Rsun, R2 = 0.81+/-0.01 Rsun, and M1 = 1.20+/-0.06 Msun, M2 =\n0.47+/-0.01 Msun.\n", "  We study the loop corrections to the scalar propagator and the fermionic\nself-energy for the mass dimension one fermionic dark matter with the Yukawa\ninteraction. We find, in the former case, there is a non-vanishing\nLorentz-violating term while the later is Lorentz-invariant. Our study of the\nfermionic loop correction shows that unitarity demands the fermionic mass must\nbe at least half of the bosonic mass and that the Lorentz-violating term makes\na non-trivial correction to the bosonic propagator. We discuss what these\nresults mean in the context of the Standard Model and the possibility of\nbypassing the unitarity constraint. In the simplest scenario, within the\nframework of standard quantum field theory, by identifying the scalar boson to\nbe the Higgs boson with a mass of 125 GeV, the mass of the fermion must be at\nleast 62.5 GeV.\n", "  Motivated by recent London penetration depth measurement [H. Kim et al. Phys.\nRev. Lett. \\textbf{114}, 027003 (2015)] and novel composite pairing scenario\n[O. Erten, R. Flint and P. Coleman, Phys. Rev. Lett. \\textbf{114}, 027002\n(2015)] on Yb-doped heavy fermion superconductor CeCoIn$_{5}$, we revisit the\nissue of superfluid response in microscopic heavy fermion lattice model.\nHowever, it is found that in literature explicit expression of superfluid\nresponse function in heavy fermion superconductor is rare. In this paper, we\nmake a contribution to this issue by investigating superfluid density response\nfunction in celebrated Kondo-Heisenberg model. To be specific, we derive\ncorresponding formalism from an effective fermionic large-N mean-field pairing\nHamiltonian, whose pairing interaction is assumed to originate from effective\nlocal antiferromagnetic exchange interaction. Interestingly, it is found that\nphysically correct superfluid density formula can only be obtained if external\nelectromagnetic field is directly coupled to heavy fermion quasi-particle. Such\nunique feature emphasizes the key role of Kondo-screening-renormalized\nquasi-particle for low-temperature/energy thermodynamics and transport\nbehaviors. As an important application, the theoretical result is compared to\nexperimental measurement in heavy fermion superconductor CeCoIn$_{5}$ and\nYb-doped Ce$_{1-x}$Yb$_{x}$CoIn$_{5}$, where the agreement is fairly good and\nthe transition of pairing symmetry in the latter one is explained as a simple\ndoping effect. In addition, the requisite formalism for the commonly\nencountered nonmagnetic impurity and non-local electrodynamic effect are\ndeveloped.\n", "  We study the thermodynamics of a zero-dimensional, cubic cluster described\nwith a Hubbard Hamiltonian, focusing our interest on the magnetic properties.\nThe range in which the studied cluster is paramagnetic is considered. The\nresults are obtained by means of exact numerical diagonalization. Such\nthermodynamic quantities as entropy, specific heat, magnetic susceptibility,\nspin-spin correlations and double occupancy are discussed. Particular emphasis\nis put on the behaviour of local maxima of specific heat and susceptibility,\nwhich are analysed in terms of Schottky anomalies.\n", "  Supermassive black holes observed at high redshift $z\\gtrsim6$ could grow\nfrom direct collapse black holes (DCBHs) with mass $\\sim10^5\\,M_{\\odot}$, which\nresult from the collapse of supermassive stars (SMSs). If a relativistic jet is\nlaunched from a DCBH, it can break out of the collapsing SMS and produce a\ngamma-ray burst (GRB). Although most of the GRB jets are off-axis from our line\nof sight, we show that the energy injected from the jet into a cocoon is huge\n$\\sim10^{55-56}\\,{\\rm{erg}}$, so that the cocoon fireball is observed as\nultra-luminous supernovae of $\\sim10^{45-46}\\rm{\\,erg\\,s^{-1}}$ for $\\sim5000\n[(1+z)/16] \\rm{\\,days}$. They are detectable by the future telescopes with near\ninfrared bands, such as, $Euclid$, $WFIRST$, $WISH$, and $JWST$ up to $z\\sim20$\nand $\\sim 100$ events per year, providing a direct evidence of the DCBH\nscenario.\n", "  We consider four-dimensional qudits as qubit pairs and their qudit Pauli\noperators as qubit Clifford operators. This introduces a nesting, $C_1^2\n\\subset C_2^4 \\subset C_3^2$, where $C_n^m$ is the $n$th level of the\n$m$-dimensional qudit Clifford hierarchy. If we can convert between logical\nqubits and qudits, then qudit Clifford operators are qubit non-Clifford\noperators. Conversion is achieved by qubit fusion and qudit fission using\nstabilizer circuits that consume a resource state. This resource is a fused\nqubit stabilizer state with a fault-tolerant state preparation using stabilizer\ncircuits.\n", "  The electronic and optical properties of nonuniform bilayer graphene\nnanoribbons are worth investigating as they exhibit rich magnetic quantization.\nBased on our numerical results, their electronic and optical properties\nstrongly depend on the competition between magnetic quantization, lateral\nconfinement, and stacking configuration. The results of our calculations lead\nto four categories of magneto-electronic energy spectra, namely monolayer-like,\nbilayer-like, coexistent, and irregular quasi-Landau-level like. Various types\nof spectra described in this paper are mainly characterized by unusual spatial\ndistributions of wave functions in the system under study. In our paper, we\ndemonstrate that these unusual quantized modes lead to the appearance of such\ndiverse magneto-optical spectra. Moreover, the investigation of the density of\nstates in our model leads to the appearance of many prominent symmetric and\nweakly asymmetric peaks. The almost well-behaved quasi-Landau levels exhibit\nhigh-intensity peaks with specific selection rules, and the distorted energy\nsubbands present numerous low-intensity peaks without any selection rules.\n", "  The Traveling Salesperson problem asks for the shortest cyclic tour visiting\na set of cities given their pairwise distances and belongs to the NP-hard\ncomplexity class, which means that with all known algorithms in the worst case\ninstances are not solveable in polynomial time, i.e., the problem is hard.\nThough that does not mean, that there are not subsets of the problem which are\neasy to solve. To examine numerically transitions from an easy to a hard phase,\na random ensemble of cities in the Euclidean plane given a parameter {\\sigma},\nwhich governs the hardness, is introduced. Here, a linear programming approach\ntogether with suitable cutting planes is applied. Such algorithms operate\noutside the space of feasible solutions and are often used in practical\napplication but rarely studied in physics so far. We observe several\ntransitions. To characterize these transitions, scaling assumptions from\ncontinuous phase transitions are applied\n", "  We investigate tunneling across a single ferromagnetic barrier on the surface\nof a three-dimensional topological insulator. In the presence of a\nmagnetization component along the bias direction, a tunneling planar Hall\nconductance (TPHC), transverse to the applied bias, develops. Electrostatic\ncontrol of the barrier enables a giant Hall angle, with the TPHC exceeding the\nlongitudinal tunneling conductance. By changing the in-plane magnetization\ndirection it is possible to change the sign of both the longitudinal and\ntransverse differential conductance without opening a gap in the topological\nsurface state. The transport in a topological insulator/ferromagnet junction\ncan thus be drastically altered from a simple spin-valve to an amplifier.\n", "  The development of high-energy and high-power density supercapacitors (SCs)\nis critical for enabling next-generation energy storage applications.\nNanocarbons are excellent SC electrode materials due to their economic\nviability, high-surface area, and high stability. Although nanocarbons have\nhigh theoretical surface area and hence high double layer capacitance, the net\namount of energy stored in nanocarbon-SCs is much below theoretical limits due\nto two inherent bottlenecks: i) their low quantum capacitance and ii) limited\nion-accessible surface area. Here, we demonstrate that defects in graphene\ncould be effectively used to mitigate these bottlenecks by drastically\nincreasing the quantum capacitance and opening new channels to facilitate ion\ndiffusion in otherwise closed interlayer spaces. Our results support the\nemergence of a new energy paradigm in SCs with 250% enhancement in double layer\ncapacitance beyond the theoretical limit. Furthermore, we demonstrate prototype\ndefect engineered bulk SC devices with energy densities 500% higher than\nstate-of-the-art commercial SCs without compromising the power density.\n", "  We consider discretisations of the Macdonald--Mehta integrals from the theory\nof finite reflection groups. For the classical groups, $\\mathrm{A}_{r-1}$,\n$\\mathrm{B}_r$ and $\\mathrm{D}_r$, we provide closed-form evaluations in those\ncases for which the Weyl denominators featuring in the summands have exponents\n$1$ and $2$. Our proofs for the exponent-$1$ cases rely on identities for\nclassical group characters, while most of the formulas for the exponent-$2$\ncases are derived from a transformation formula for elliptic hypergeometric\nseries for the root system $\\mathrm{BC}_r$. As a byproduct of our results, we\nobtain closed-form product formulas for the (ordinary and signed) enumeration\nof orthogonal and symplectic tableaux contained in a box.\n", "  Recently, it has been observed that in a T-duality invariant world-volume\ntheory in flat spacetime, all orders of gauge field strength and all orders of\nthe D-brane velocity appear in two specific matrices. Using these two matrices,\nwe construct the world-volume couplings of two massless NSNS states at order\n$\\alpha'^2$ and all orders of the velocity and the gauge field strength, by\nrequiring them to be invariant under the linear T-duality. The standard\nextension $F\\rightarrow F+P[B]$, then produces all orders of the pull-back of\nB-field into the action. We compare the resulting couplings for zero velocity\nand gauge field strength, with the $\\alpha'^2$ terms of the disk-level S-matrix\nelement of two massless NSNS vertex operators in the presence of a constant\nbackground B-field. We have found an exact agreement.\n", "  We study magnetic field penetration into a thin film made of a\nsuperconducting niobium. Imaging of magnetic field is performed by optically\ndetecting magnetic resonances of negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy defects\ninside a single crystal diamond, which is attached to the niobium film under\nstudy. The experimental results are compared with theoretical predictions based\non the critical state model, and good agreement is obtained.\n", "  The Lindblad equation is widely employed in studies of Markovian quantum open\nsystems. Here, firstly, a simple result is presented on the time evolution of\nthe non Neumann entropy under the Lindblad equation, which enables one to\nexamine if the entropy increases/decreases. Then, secondly, the following\nquestion is posed: In a quantum open system with a time-dependent Hamiltonian,\nwhat is the corresponding Lindblad equation for the quantum state that keeps\nthe internal energy of the system constant in time? This issue is of importance\nin realizing quasi-stationary states of open systems such as quantum circuits\nand batteries. As an illustrative example, the time-dependent harmonic\noscillator is analyzed. The Lindbladian operator is uniquely determined with\nthe help of a Lie-algebraic structure, and the time derivative of the von\nNeumann entropy is shown to be nonnegative depending on the time-dependence of\nthe Hamiltonian.\n", "  We study geodesics in the complete family of expanding impulsive\ngravitational waves propagating in spaces of constant curvature, that is\nMinkowski, de Sitter and anti-de Sitter universes. Employing the continuous\nform of the metric we rigorously prove existence and global uniqueness of\ncontinuously differentiable geodesics (in the sense of Filippov) and study\ntheir interaction with the impulsive wave. Thereby we justify the\n\"$C^1$-matching procedure\" used in the literature to derive their explicit\nform.\n", "  The charge-density-wave (CDW) phase is a macroscopic quantum state consisting\nof a periodic modulation of the electronic charge density accompanied by a\nperiodic distortion of the atomic lattice in quasi-1D or layered 2D metallic\ncrystals. Several layered transition metal dichalcogenides, such as 1T-TaSe2,\n1T-TaS2 and 1T-TiSe2, exhibit unusually high transition temperatures to\ndifferent CDW symmetry-reducing phases. These transitions can be affected by\nenvironmental conditions, film thickness and applied electric bias. However,\ndevice applications of these intriguing systems at room temperature or their\nintegration with other 2D materials have not been explored. Here we show that\nin 2D CDW 1T-TaS2, the abrupt change in the electrical conductivity and\nhysteresis at the transition point between nearly-commensurate and\nincommensurate charge-density-wave phases can be used for constructing an\noscillator that operates at room temperature. The hexagonal boron nitride was\ncapped on 1T-TaS2 thin film to provide protection from oxidation, and an\nintegrated graphene transistor provides a voltage tunable, matched,\nlow-resistance load enabling precise voltage control of the oscillator\nfrequency. The integration of these three disparate two-dimensional materials,\nin a way that exploits the unique properties of each, yields a simple,\nminiaturized, voltage-controlled oscillator device. Theoretical considerations\nsuggest that the upper limit of oscillation frequency to be in the THz regime.\n", "  We studied the environment of the dust bubble N10 in molecular emission.\nInfrared bubbles, first detected by the GLIMPSE survey at 8.0 $\\mu$m, are ideal\nregions to investigate the effect of the expansion of the HII region on its\nsurroundings eventual triggered star formation at its borders. In this work, we\npresent a multi-wavelength study of N10. This bubble is especially interesting\nas infrared studies of the young stellar content suggest a scenario of ongoing\nstar formation, possibly triggered, on the edge of the HII region. We carried\nout observations of $^{12}$CO(1-0) and $^{13}$CO(1-0) emission at PMO 13.7-m\ntowards N10. We also analyzed the IR and sub-mm emission on this region and\ncompare those different tracers to obtain a detailed view of the interaction\nbetween the expanding HII region and the molecular gas. We also estimated the\nparameters of the denser cold dust condensation and of the ionized gas inside\nthe shell. Bright CO emission was detected and two molecular clumps were\nidentified, from which we have derived physical parameters. We also estimate\nthe parameters for the densest cold dust condensation and for the ionized gas\ninside the shell. The comparison between the dynamical age of this region and\nthe fragmentation time scale favors the \"Radiation-Driven Implosion\" mechanism\nof star formation. N10 reveals to be specially interesting case with gas\nstructures in a narrow frontier between HII region and surrounding molecular\nmaterial, and with a range of ages of YSOs situated in region indicating\ntriggered star formation.\n", "  India-based Neutrino Observatory (INO) facility is going to have a 50 kton\nmagnetized Iron CALorimeter (ICAL) detector for precision measurements of\nneutrino oscillations using atmospheric neutrinos. The proposed ICAL detector\nwill be a stack of magnetized iron plates (acting as target material)\ninterleaved with glass Resistive Plate Chambers (RPCs) as the active detector\nelements. An RPC is a gaseous detector made up of two parallel electrode plates\nhaving high bulk resistivity like that of float glass and bakelite. For the\nICAL detector, glass is preferred over bakelite as it does not need any kind of\nsurface treatment to achieve better surface uniformity and also the cost of\nassociated electronics is reduced. Under the detector R&D efforts for the\nproposed glass RPC detector, a few glass RPCs of 1m X 1m dimension are\nfabricated procuring glass of ~ 2 mm thickness from one of the Indian glass\nmanufacturers (Asahi). In the present paper, we report the characterization of\nRPC based on leakage current study, muon detection efficiency and noise rate\nstudies with varying gas compositions.\n", "  Surface and color codes are two forms of topological quantum error correction\nin two spatial dimensions with complementary properties. Surface codes have\nlower-depth error detection circuits and well-developed decoders to interpret\nand correct errors, while color codes have transversal Clifford gates and\nbetter code efficiency in the number of physical qubits needed to achieve a\ngiven code distance. A formal equivalence exists between color codes and folded\nsurface codes, but it does not guarantee the transferability of any of these\nfavorable properties. However, the equivalence does imply the existence of\nconstant-depth circuit implementations of logical Clifford gates on folded\nsurface codes. We achieve and improve this result by constructing two families\nof folded surface codes with transversal Clifford gates. This construction is\npresented generally for qudits of any dimension. The specific application of\nthese codes to universal quantum computation based on qubit fusion is also\ndiscussed.\n", "  We deal with magnetic structures that attain integer and half-integer\nskyrmion numbers. We model and solve the problem analytically, and show how the\nsolutions appear in materials that engender distinct, very specific physical\nproperties, and use them to describe their topological features. In particular,\nwe found a way to model skyrmion with a large transition region correlated with\nthe presence of a two-peak skyrmion number density. Moreover, we run into the\nissue concerning the topological strength of a vortex-like structure and\nsuggest an experimental realization, important to decide how to modify and\nmeasure the topological strength of the magnetic structure.\n", "  Manufacturing of particulate products across many industries relies on\naccurate measurements of particle size distributions in dispersions or powders.\nLaser diffraction (or small angle light scattering) is commonly used, usually\noff-line, for particle size measurements. The estimation of particle sizes by\nthis method requires the solution of an inverse problem using a suitable\nscattering model that takes into account size, shape and optical properties of\nthe particles. However, laser diffraction instruments are usually accompanied\nby software that employs a default scattering model for spherical particles,\nwhich is then used to solve the inverse problem even though a significant\nnumber of particulate products occur in strongly non-spherical shapes such as\nneedles. In this work, we demonstrate that using the spherical model for the\nestimation of sizes of needle-like particles can lead to the appearance of\nartefacts in the form of multimodal populations of particles with size modes\nmuch smaller than those actually present in the sample. This effect can result\nin a significant under-estimation of the mean particle size and in false modes\nin estimated particles size distributions.\n", "  Highly-anisotropic plasmonic nanotubes exhibit a dramatic drop of the\nscattering cross section in the transition regime from hyperbolic to elliptic\ndispersion. The characterization of a realistic multilayered metamaterial is\ntypically carried out by means of an effective medium approach providing\naverage components of the permittivity tensor and wave fields. Here, the edge\neffects of the metal-dielectric stratified nanotube for different combinations\nwere thoroughly analyzed. We show how the boundary layers, which in principle\nremain fully irrelevant in the estimation of the effective permittivity of the\nnanotube, however play a critical role in the resonant scattering spectra and\nthe near field patterns. A remarkable enhancement of the scattered wave field\nis unexpectedly experienced at the frequencies of interest when a dielectric\nlayer is chosen to be in contact with the cavity core.\n", "  Anomalous chiral conductivities in theories with global anomalies are\nindependent of whether they are computed in a weakly coupled quantum (or\nthermal) field theory, hydrodynamics, or at infinite coupling from holography.\nWhile the presence of dynamical gauge fields and mixed, gauge-global anomalies\ncan destroy this universality, in their absence, the non-renormalisation of\nanomalous Ward identities is expected to be obeyed at all intermediate coupling\nstrengths. In holography, bulk theories with higher-derivative corrections\nincorporate coupling constant corrections to the boundary theory observables in\nan expansion around infinite coupling. In this work, we investigate the\ncoupling constant dependence and universality of anomalous conductivities (and\nthus of the anomalous Ward identities) in general, four-dimensional systems\nthat possess asymptotically anti-de Sitter holographic duals with a\nnon-extremal black brane in five dimensions, and anomalous transport introduced\ninto the boundary theory via the bulk Chern-Simons action. We show that in bulk\ntheories with arbitrary gauge- and diffeomorphism-invariant higher-derivative\nactions, anomalous conductivities, which can incorporate an infinite series of\n(inverse) coupling constant corrections, remain universal. Owing to the\nexistence of the membrane paradigm, the proof reduces to a construction of bulk\neffective theories at the horizon and the boundary. It only requires us to\nimpose the condition of horizon regularity and correct boundary conditions on\nthe fields. We also discuss ways to violate the universality by violating\nconditions for the validity of the membrane paradigm, in particular, by adding\nmass to the vector fields (a case with a mixed, gauge-global anomaly) and in\nbulk geometries with a naked singularity.\n", "  We study the supremum of the total mean curvature on the boundary of compact,\nmean-convex 3-manifolds with nonnegative scalar curvature, and a prescribed\nboundary metric. We establish an additivity property for this supremum and\nexhibit rigidity for maximizers assuming the supremum is attained. When the\nboundary consists of 2-spheres, we demonstrate that the finiteness of the\nsupremum follows from the previous work of Shi-Tam and Wang-Yau on the\nquasi-local mass problem in general relativity. In turn, we define a\nvariational analog of Brown-York quasi-local mass without assuming that the\nboundary 2-sphere has positive Gauss curvature.\n", "  The thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect and soft X-ray emission are\nroutinely observed around massive galaxies and in galaxy groups and clusters.\nWe study these observational diagnostics of galaxy haloes for a suite of\ncosmological `zoom-in' simulations from the `Feedback In Realistic\nEnvironments' project, which spans a large range in halo mass 10^10-10^13\nMsun). We explore the effect of stellar feedback on the hot gas observables.\nThe properties of our simulated groups, such as baryon fractions, SZ flux, and\nX-ray luminosities (L_X), are broadly consistent with existing observations,\neven though feedback from active galactic nuclei is not included. We make\npredictions for future observations of lower-mass objects for both SZ and\ndiffuse X-ray measurements, finding that they are not just scaled-down versions\nof massive galaxies, but more strongly affected by galactic winds driven by\nstar formation. Low-mass haloes (<~10^11 Msun) retain a low fraction of their\nbaryons, which results in a strong suppression of the SZ signal. Our\nsimulations therefore predict a scaling with halo mass that is steeper than\nself-similar for haloes less massive than 10^13 Msun. For halo masses <~10^12\nMsun, L_X is time-variable and correlated primarily with the star formation\nrate (SFR). For these objects, the diffuse X-ray emission is powered mostly by\ngalactic winds and the gas dominating the X-ray emission is flowing out with\nradial velocities close to the halo's circular velocity. For halo masses\n>~10^13 Msun, on the other hand, L_X is much less variable and not correlated\nwith the SFR, because the emission originates from the quasi-hydrostatic,\nvirialized halo gas.\n", "  We use the existence of habitable planets to impose anthropic requirements on\nthe fine structure constant, $\\alpha$. To this effect, we present two\nconsiderations that restrict its value to be very near the one observed. The\nfirst, that the end product of stellar fusion is iron and not one of its\nneighboring elements, restricts $\\alpha^{-1}$ to be $145\\pm 50$. The second,\nthat radiogenic heat in the Earth's interior remains adequately productive for\nbillions of years, restricts it to be $145\\pm9$. A connection with the grand\nunified theory window is discussed, effectively providing a route to probe\nultra-high energy physics with upcoming advances in planetary science.\n", "  The aim of the present investigation is to study the spatio-temporal\ndistribution of precursor flares during the 24-hour interval preceding M- and\nX-class major flares and the evolution of follower flares. Information on\nassociated (precursor and follower) flares is provided by Reuven Ramaty High\nEnergy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI). Flare List, while the major flares\nare observed by the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES)\nsystem satellites between 2002 and 2014. There are distinct evolutionary\ndifferences between the spatio-temporal distributions of associated flares in\nabout one day period depending on the type of the main flare. The spatial\ndistribution was characterised by the normalised frequency distribution of the\nquantity $\\delta$ (the distance between the major flare and its precursor flare\nnormalised by the sunspot group diameter) in four 6-hour time intervals before\nthe major event. The precursors of X-class flares have a double-peaked spatial\ndistribution for more than half a day prior to the major flare, but it changes\nto a lognormal-like distribution roughly 6 hours prior to the event. The\nprecursors of M-class flares show lognormal-like distribution in each 6-hour\nsubinterval. The most frequent sites of the precursors in the active region are\nwithin a distance of about 0.1 diameter of sunspot group from the site of the\nmajor flare in each case. Our investigation shows that the build-up of energy\nis more effective than the release of energy because of precursors.\n", "  Spectral statistics of weakly-disordered triangular graphene flakes with\nzigzag edges are revisited. Earlier, we have found numerically that such\nsystems may shown spectral fluctuations of GUE, signalling the time-reversal\nsymmetry breaking at zero magnetic field, accompanied by approximate twofold\nvalley degeneracy of each energy level [Phys. Rev. B 85, 245424 (2012)].\nAtomic-scale disorder induce the scattering of charge carriers between the\nvalleys and restores the spectral fluctuations of GOE. A simplified description\nof such a nonstandard GUE-GOE transition, employing the mixed ensemble of 4x4\nreal symmetric matrices was also proposed. Here we complement our previous\nstudy by analyzing numerically the spectral fluctuations of large matrices\nbelonging the same mixed ensemble. Resulting scaling laws relate the ensemble\nparameter to physical size and the number of atomic-scale defects in graphene\nflake. A phase diagram, indicating the regions in which the signatures of GUE\nmay by observable in the size-doping parameter plane, is presented.\n", "  Higgs-flavon fields appear as a part of the Froggatt-Nielsen (FN) mechanism,\nwhich attempts to explain the hierarchy of Yukawa couplings. We explore the\npossibility that the 750 GeV diphoton resonance recently reported at the LHC13,\ncould be identified with a low-scale Higgs-flavon field $H_F$ and find the\nregion of the parameter space consistent with CMS and ATLAS data. It is found\nthat the extra vector-like fermions of the ultraviolet completion of the FN\nmechanism are necessary in order to reproduce the observed signal. We consider\na standard model (SM) extension that contains two Higgs doublets (a standard\none and an inert one) and one complex FN singlet. The inert doublet includes a\nstable neutral boson, which provides a viable dark matter candidate, while the\nmixing of the standard doublet and the FN singlet induces flavor violation in\nthe Higgs sector at the tree-level. Constraints on the parameters of the model\nare derived from the LHC Higgs data, which include the search for the lepton\nflavor violating decay of the SM Higgs boson $h\\to \\bar{\\mu}\\tau $. It is also\nfound that in some region of the parameter space the model may give rise to a\nlarge branching ratio for the $H_F \\to hh$ decay, of the order of 0.1, which\ncould be searched for at the LHC.\n", "  Using molecular dynamics simulation, we investigate the slow dynamics of a\nsupercooled binary mixture of soft particles interacting with a generalized\nHertzian potential. At low density, it displays typical slow dynamics near its\nglass transition temperature. At higher densities, particles bond together,\nforming clusters, and the clusters undergo the glass transition. The number of\nparticles in a cluster increases one by one as the density increases. We\ndemonstrate that there exist the multiple cluster-glass phases characterized by\na different number of particles per cluster, each of which is separated by\ndistinct minima. Surprisingly, a so-called higher order singularity of the\nmode-coupling theory signaled by a logarithmic relaxation is observed in the\nvicinity of the boundaries between monomer and cluster glass phases. The system\nalso exhibits rich and anomalous dynamics in the cluster glass phases, such as\nthe decoupling of the self- and collective dynamics.\n", "  Topological states of matter are peculiar quantum phases showing different\nedge and bulk transport properties connected by the bulk-boundary\ncorrespondence. While non-interacting fermionic topological insulators are well\nestablished by now and have been classified according to a ten-fold scheme, the\npossible realisation of topological states for bosons has not been much\nexplored yet. Furthermore, the role of interactions is far from being\nunderstood. Here, we show that a topological state of matter exclusively driven\nby interactions may occur in the p-band of a Lieb optical lattice filled with\nultracold bosons. The single-particle spectrum of the system displays a\nremarkable parabolic band-touching point, with both bands exhibiting\nnon-negative curvature. Although the system is neither topological at the\nsingle-particle level, nor for the interacting ground state, on-site\ninteractions induce an anomalous Hall effect for the excitations, carrying a\nnon-zero Chern number. Our work introduces an experimentally realistic strategy\nfor the formation of interaction-driven topological states of bosons.\n", "  We present ultraviolet through near-infrared photometry and spectroscopy of\nthe host galaxies of all superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) discovered by the\nPalomar Transient Factory prior to 2013, and derive measurements of their\nluminosities, star-formation rates, stellar masses, and gas-phase\nmetallicities. We find that Type I (hydrogen-poor) SLSNe are found almost\nexclusively in low-mass (M < 2x10^9 M_sun) and metal-poor (12+log[O/H] < 8.4)\ngalaxies. We compare the mass and metallicity distributions of our sample to\nnearby galaxy catalogs in detail and conclude that the rate of SLSNe-I as a\nfraction of all SNe is heavily suppressed in galaxies with metallicities >0.5\nZ_sun. Extremely low metallicities are not required, and indeed provide no\nfurther increase in the relative SLSN rate. Several SLSN-I hosts are undergoing\nvigorous starbursts, but this may simply be a side effect of metallicity\ndependence: dwarf galaxies tend to have bursty star-formation histories.\nType-II (hydrogen-rich) SLSNe are found over the entire range of galaxy masses\nand metallicities, and their integrated properties do not suggest a strong\npreference for (or against) low-mass/low-metallicity galaxies. Two hosts\nexhibit unusual properties: PTF 10uhf is a Type I SLSN in a massive, luminous\ninfrared galaxy at redshift z=0.29, while PTF 10tpz is a Type II SLSN located\nin the nucleus of an early-type host at z=0.04.\n", "  We establish results similar to Kramers and Lieb-Schultz-Mattis theorems but\ninvolving only translation symmetry and for Majorana modes. In particular, we\nshow that all states are at least doubly degenerate in any one and two\ndimensional array of Majorana modes with translation symmetry, periodic\nboundary conditions, and an odd number of modes per unit cell. Moreover, we\nshow that all such systems have an underlying $\\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetry and\nexplicitly construct the generator of the supersymmetry. Furthermore, we\nestablish that there cannot be a unique gapped ground state in such one\ndimensional systems with anti-periodic boundary conditions. These general\nresults are fundamentally a consequence of the fact that translations for\nMajorana modes are represented projectively, which in turn stems from the\nanomalous nature of a single Majorana mode. An experimental signature of the\ndegeneracy arising from supersymmetry is a zero-bias peak in tunneling\nconductance.\n", "  The normal state of strongly coupled superconductors is characterized by the\npresence of \"preformed\" Cooper pairs well above the superconducting critical\ntemperature. In this regime, the electrons are paired, but they lack the phase\ncoherence necessary for superconductivity. The existence of preformed pairs\nimplies the existence of a characteristic energy scale associated to a\npseudogap. Preformed pairs are often invoked to interpret systems where some\nsignatures of pairing are present without actual superconductivity, but an\nunambiguous theoretical characterization of a preformed-pair system is still\nlacking. To fill this gap, we consider the response to an external pairing\nfield of an attractive Hubbard model, which hosts one of the cleanest\nrealizations of a preformed pair phase, and a repulsive model where s-wave\nsuperconductivity can not be realized. Using dynamical mean-field theory to\nstudy this response, we identify the characteristic features which distinguish\nthe reaction of a preformed pair state from a normal metal without any\nprecursor of pairing. The theoretical detection of preformed pairs is\nassociated with the behavior of the second derivative of the order parameter\nwith respect to the external field, as confirmed by analytic calculations in\nlimiting cases. Our findings provide a solid testbed for the interpretation of\nstate-of-the-art calculations for the normal state of the doped Hubbard model\nin terms of d-wave preformed pairs and, in perspective, of non-equilibrium\nexperiments in high-temperature superconductors.\n", "  We investigate the analytic structure of thermal energy-momentum tensor\ncorrelators at large but finite coupling in quantum field theories with gravity\nduals. We compute corrections to the quasinormal spectra of black branes due to\nthe presence of higher derivative $R^2$ and $R^4$ terms in the action, focusing\non the dual to $\\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM theory and Gauss-Bonnet gravity. We observe\nthe appearance of new poles in the complex frequency plane at finite coupling.\nThe new poles interfere with hydrodynamic poles of the correlators leading to\nthe breakdown of hydrodynamic description at a coupling-dependent critical\nvalue of the wave-vector. The dependence of the critical wave vector on the\ncoupling implies that the range of validity of the hydrodynamic description\nincreases monotonically with the coupling. The behavior of the quasinormal\nspectrum at large but finite coupling may be contrasted with the known\nproperties of the hierarchy of relaxation times determined by the spectrum of a\nlinearized kinetic operator at weak coupling. We find that the ratio of a\ntransport coefficient such as viscosity to the relaxation time determined by\nthe fundamental non-hydrodynamic quasinormal frequency changes rapidly in the\nvicinity of infinite coupling but flattens out for weaker coupling, suggesting\nan extrapolation from strong coupling to the kinetic theory result. We note\nthat the behavior of the quasinormal spectrum is qualitatively different\ndepending on whether the ratio of shear viscosity to entropy density is greater\nor less than the universal, infinite coupling value of $\\hbar/4\\pi k_B$. In the\nformer case, the density of poles increases, indicating a formation of branch\ncuts in the weak coupling limit, and the spectral function shows the appearance\nof narrow peaks. We also discuss the relation of the viscosity-entropy ratio to\nconjectured bounds on relaxation time in quantum systems.\n", "  Newly formed planets (or brown dwarfs) may possess disks or rings that occupy\nan appreciable fraction of the planet's Hill sphere and extend beyond the\nLaplace radius, where the tidal torque from the host star dominates over the\ntorque from the oblate planet. Such a disk/ring can exhibit unique, detectable\ntransit signatures, provided that the disk/ring is significantly misaligned\nwith the orbital plane of the planet. There exists tentative evidence for an\nextended ring system around the young K5 star 1 SWASP J140747-354542. We\npresent a general theoretical study of the inclination (warp) profile of\ncircumplanetary disks under the combined influences of the tidal torque from\nthe central star, the torque from the oblate planet and the self-gravity of the\ndisk. We calculate the steady-state warp profile (\"generalized Laplace\nSurface\") and investigate the condition for coherent precession of the disk. We\nfind that to maintain non-negligible misalignment between the extended outer\ndisk and the planet's orbital plane, and to ensure coherent disk precession,\nthe disk surface density must be sufficiently large so that the self-gravity\ntorque overcomes the tidal torque from the central star. Our analysis and\nquantitative results can be used to constrain the parameters of transiting\ncircumplanetary disks that may be detected in the future.\n", "  Conventional superconductors disordered by magnetic impurities demonstrate\nphysical properties drastically different from their pristine counterparts. In\nour previous work [Phys. Rev. B 92, 245430 (2015)] we explored spectral and\nthermodynamic properties of such systems for two extreme cases: completely\nrandom and ferromagnetically aligned impurity magnetic moments. Here we\nconsider transport properties of these systems, and show that they have a\npotential to be used in superconducting spintronic devices. Each magnetic\nimpurity contributes a Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) bound state to the spectrum,\nresiding at sub-gap energies. Provided the YSR states form metallic bands, we\ndemonstrate that the tunneling current carried by these states can be highly\nspin-polarized when the impurities are ferromagnetically ordered. The spin\npolarization can be switched by simply tuning the bias voltage. Moreover, even\nwhen the impurity spins are completely uncorrelated, one can still achieve\nalmost 100% spin polarization of the current, if the tunnel interface is\nspin-active. We compute electric current and noise, varying parameters of the\ninterface between tunneling and fully transparent regimes, and analyze the\nrelative role of single-particle and Andreev reflection processes.\n", "  Completing a full replication study of our previously published findings on\nbluff-body aerodynamics was harder than we thought. Despite the fact that we\nhave good reproducible-research practices, sharing our code and data openly.\nHere's what we learned from three years, four CFD codes and hundreds of runs.\n", "  We consider the scattering of a quantum particle by two independent,\nsuccessive parity-invariant point interactions in one dimension. The parameter\nspace for the two point interactions is given by the direct product of two\ntori, which is described by four parameters. By investigating the effects of\nthe two point interactions on the transmission probability of plane wave, we\nobtain the conditions for the parameter space under which perfect resonant\ntransmission occur. The resonance conditions are found to be described by\nsymmetric and anti-symmetric relations between the parameters.\n", "  We study moduli stabilization for type IIB orientifolds compactified on\nCalabi-Yau threefolds in the region close to conifold singularities in the\ncomplex structure moduli space. The form of the periods implies new phenomena\nlike exponential mass hierarchies even in the regime of negligible warping.\nIntegrating out the heavy conic complex structure modulus leads to an effective\nflux induced potential for the axio-dilaton and the remaining complex structure\nmoduli containing exponentially suppressed terms that imitate non-perturbative\neffects. It is shown that this scenario can be naturally combined with the\nlarge volume scenario so that all moduli are dynamically stabilized in the\ndilute flux regime. As an application of this moduli stabilization scheme, a\nstring inspired model of aligned inflation is designed that features a\nparametrically controlled hierarchy of mass scales.\n", "  We discuss constraints on KKLT/KKLMMT and LVS scenarios that use anti-branes\nto get an uplift to a deSitter vacuum, coming from requiring the validity of an\neffective field theory description of the physics. We find these are not always\nsatisfied or are hard to satisfy.\n", "  We study persistent currents in a Josephson junction array wrapped around a\ncylinder. The $T=0$ quantum statistical mechanics of the array is equivalent to\nthe statistical mechanics of a classical $xy$ spin system in 2+1 dimensions at\nthe effective temperature $T^{*}=\\sqrt{2JU}$, with $J$ being the Josephson\nenergy of the junction and $U$ being the charging energy of the superconducting\nisland. It is investigated analytically and numerically on lattices containing\nover one million sites. For weak disorder and $T^{*}\\ll J$ the dependence of\nthe persistent current on disorder and $T^{*}$ computed numerically agrees\nquantitatively with the analytical result derived within the spin-wave\napproximation. The high-$T^{*}$ and/or strong-disorder behavior is dominated by\ninstantons corresponding to the vortex loops in 2+1 dimensions. The current\nbecomes destroyed completely at the quantum phase transition into the\nCooper-pair insulating phase.\n", "  We show that the exact master equation incorporating initial correlations for\nopen quantum systems, within the Nakajima-Zwanzig operator-projection method,\nis a homegenous master equation for the reduced density matrix. We also derive\nexplicitly the exact master equation for a large class of bosonic and fermionic\nopen quantum systems incorporating initial correlations, the resulting master\nequation is homogenous. We find that the effects of the initial correlations\ncan be fully embedded into the fluctuation dynamics through the exact\nhomogenous master equation. Also a generalized nonequilibrium\nfluctuation-dissipation theorem incorporating the initial correlations is\nobtained.\n", "  Liquid-liquid phase separation of charge/aromatic-enriched intrinsically\ndisordered proteins (IDPs) is critical in the biological function of\nmembraneless organelles. Much of the physics of this recent discovery remains\nto be elucidated. Here we present a theory in the random phase approximation to\naccount for electrostatic effects in polyampholyte phase separations, yielding\npredictions consistent with recent experiments on the IDP Ddx4. The theory is\napplicable to any charge pattern and thus provides a general analytical\nframework for studying sequence dependence of IDP phase separation.\n", "  In a recent proposal of the half-filled Landau level, the composite fermions\nare taken to be Dirac particles and particle-hole symmetric. Cooper pairing of\nthese composite fermions in different angular momentum channels, $\\ell$, can\ngive rise to different kinds of Pfaffian states. In addition to the well known\nMoore-Read Pfaffian and anti-Pfaffian states, a new putative particle-hole\nsymmetric Pfaffian state, corresponding to the $s-$wave pairing channel, was\nalso proposed. However, the possible underlying pairing mechanism is not clear\nat all. In this work we provide a specific pairing mechanism for realizing some\nof these Pfaffian states. We show that there can be nonzero pairing in angular\nmomentum channels $|\\ell|\\ge 1$ depending on the magnitude of a coupling\nconstant. There is a quantum phase transition from the Dirac composite fermi\nliquid state to Cooper pairing states in angular momentum channels $|\\ell|\\ge\n1$ as the coupling constant is tuned across its critical point value.\nSurprisingly the particle-hole symmetric $\\ell=0$ channel pairing turns out to\nbe impossible irrespective of the size of the coupling constant.\n", "  We design plano-concave silicon lenses with coupled gradient-index plasmonic\nmetacoatings for ultrawide apertured focusing utilizing a reduced region of\n$\\sim 20 \\lambda^2$. The anomalous refraction induced in the planar input side\nof the lens and in the boundary of the wavelength-scale focal region boosts the\ncurvature of the emerging wavefront, thus significantly enhancing the\nresolution of the tightly-focused optical wave. The formation of a light tongue\nwith dimensions approaching those of the concave opening is here evidenced.\nThis scheme is expected to have potential applications in optical trapping and\ndetection.\n", "  X-ray flashes (XRFs) are a class of high-energy transients whose nature is\nstill open to question. Similar in many aspects to common gamma-ray bursts\n(GRBs), their strong X-ray emission is accompanied by very low or absent\nemission in the gamma-ray band. Despite this key difference, a number of\nindications have consolidated the idea that XRFs and GRBs share a common\norigin, including a number of potential XRF/supernova associations and the\nconsistency of some XRFs with the Amati relation for long GRBs. However, the\ndifficulties in explaining XRFs as off-axis or intrinsically weak GRBs still\ncast doubts on this interpretation. Here we explore the possibility that some\nXRFs are instead powered by the spindown of a long-lived neutron star (NS)\nformed in a binary NS (BNS) merger or, possibly, in a core-collapse supernova.\nFocusing on XRF 020903 and a few other cases observed by HETE-2, we show that\ntheir lack of gamma-ray emission, spectral properties, duration and X-ray\nluminosity find a natural explanation within our hypothesis. Moreover, we point\nout that the agreement of XRF 020903 with the Amati and Ghirlanda relations for\nlong GRBs is respectively only marginal and problematic. Assuming a BNS merger\norigin for the long-lived NS, we use XRF observations to estimate a lower limit\non the rate of BNS mergers accompanied by a potentially observable XRF signal.\nWithin the reach of the advanced LIGO and Virgo gravitational wave detectors,\nwe find >0.02-0.05 1/yr. Finally, we discuss the implications of a supernova\nassociation for the XRF events considered.\n", "  I show that the kernel of the random phase approximation (RPA) matrix based\non a stable Hartree, Hartree-Fock, Hartree-Bogolyubov or\nHartree-Fock-Bogolyubov mean field solution is decomposed into a subspace with\na basis whose vectors are associated, in the equivalent formalism of a\nclassical Hamiltonian homogeneous of second degree in canonical coordinates,\nwith conjugate momenta of cyclic coordinates (Nambu-Goldstone modes) and a\nsubspace with a basis whose vectors are associated with pairs of a coordinate\nand its conjugate momentum neither of which enters the Hamiltonian at all. In a\nsubspace complementary to the one spanned by all these coordinates including\nthe conjugate coordinates of the Nambu-Goldstone momenta, the RPA matrix\nbehaves as in the case of a zerodimensional kernel. This result was derived\nvery recently by Nakada as a corollary to a general analysis of RPA matrices\nbased on both stable and unstable mean field solutions. The present proof does\nnot rest on Nakada's general results.\n", "  We look at viscosity production in a universe consisting purely of leptons\nand photons. This is quite close to what the Universe actually look like when\nthe temperature was between $10^{10}$ K and $10^{12}$ K ($1$ -- $100$ MeV). By\ntaking the strong force and the hadronic particles out of the equation, we can\nexamine how the viscous forces behave with all the 12 leptons present. By this\nwe study how shear- and (more interestingly) bulk viscosity is affected during\nperiods with particle annihilation. We use the theory given by Hoogeveen et.\nal. from 1986, replicate their 9-particle results and expanded it to include\nthe muon and tau particles as well. This will impact the bulk viscosity\nimmensely for high temperatures. We will show that during the beginning of the\nlepton era, when the temperature is around 100 MeV, the bulk viscosity will be\nroughly 100 million times larger with muons included in the model compared to a\nmodel without.\n", "  Using the representation theory of Yangians we construct the rational\nR-matrix which takes values in the adjoint representation of SU(n). From this\nwe derive an integrable SU(n) spin chain with lattice spins transforming under\nthe adjoint representation. However, the resulting Hamiltonian is found to be\nnon-Hermitian.\n", "  A Boltzmann machine is a stochastic neural network that has been extensively\nused in the layers of deep architectures for modern machine learning\napplications. In this paper, we develop a Boltzmann machine that is capable of\nmodelling thermodynamic observables for physical systems in thermal\nequilibrium. Through unsupervised learning, we train the Boltzmann machine on\ndata sets constructed with spin configurations importance-sampled from the\npartition function of an Ising Hamiltonian at different temperatures using\nMonte Carlo (MC) methods. The trained Boltzmann machine is then used to\ngenerate spin states, for which we compare thermodynamic observables to those\ncomputed by direct MC sampling. We demonstrate that the Boltzmann machine can\nfaithfully reproduce the observables of the physical system. Further, we\nobserve that the number of neurons required to obtain accurate results\nincreases as the system is brought close to criticality.\n", "  For a sequence of integers $\\{a(x)\\}_{x \\geq 1}$ we show that the\ndistribution of the pair correlations of the fractional parts of $\\{ \\langle\n\\alpha a(x) \\rangle \\}_{x \\geq 1}$ is asymptotically Poissonian for almost all\n$\\alpha$ if the additive energy of truncations of the sequence has a power\nsavings improvement over the trivial estimate. Furthermore, we give an estimate\nfor the Hausdorff dimension of the exceptional set as a function of the density\nof the sequence and the power savings in the energy estimate. A consequence of\nthese results is that the Hausdorff dimension of the set of $\\alpha$ such that\n$\\{\\langle \\alpha x^d \\rangle\\}$ fails to have Poissonian pair correlation is\nat most $\\frac{d+2}{d+3} < 1$. This strengthens a result of Rudnick and Sarnak\nwhich states that the exceptional set has zero Lebesgue measure. On the other\nhand, classical examples imply that the exceptional set has Hausdorff dimension\nat least $\\frac{2}{d+1}$.\n  An appendix by Jean Bourgain was added after the first version of this paper\nwas written. In this appendix two problems raised in the paper are solved.\n", "  We perform an exact diagonalization study of the spin-$1/2$ XXZ Heisenberg\nantiferromagnet on the kagome lattice at finite magnetization $m = \\frac{2}{3}$\nwith an emphasis on the XY point ($J_z = 0$), and in the presence of a small\nchiral term. Recent analytic work by Kumar, Sun and Fradkin [Phys. Rev. B 90,\n174409 (2014)] on the same model, using a newly developed flux attachment\ntransformation, predicts a plateau at this value of the magnetization described\nby a chiral spin liquid (CSL) with a spin Hall conductance of $\\sigma_{xy} =\n\\frac{1}{2}$. Such a state is topological in nature, has a ground state\ndegeneracy and exhibits fractional excitations. We analyze the degeneracy\nstructure in the low energy manifold, identify the candidate topological states\nand use them to compute the modular matrices and Chern numbers all of which\nstrongly agree with expected theoretical behavior for the $\\sigma_{xy} =\n\\frac{1}{2}$ CSL. We argue that the evidence suggests the CSL is robust even in\nthe limit of zero external chirality.\n", "  Microwave-frequency superconducting resonators are ideally suited to perform\ndispersive qubit readout, to mediate two-qubit gates, and to shuttle states\nbetween distant quantum systems. A prerequisite for these applications is a\nstrong qubit-resonator coupling. Strong coupling between an electron-spin qubit\nand a microwave resonator can be achieved by correlating spin- and orbital\ndegrees of freedom. This correlation can be achieved through the Zeeman\ncoupling of a single electron in a double quantum dot to a spatially\ninhomogeneous magnetic field generated by a nearby nanomagnet. In this paper,\nwe consider such a device and estimate spin-resonator couplings of order ~ 1\nMHz with realistic parameters. Further, through realistic simulations, we show\nthat precise placement of the double dot relative to the nanomagnet allows to\nselect between a purely longitudinal coupling (commuting with the bare spin\nHamiltonian) and a purely transverse (spin non-conserving) coupling.\nAdditionally, we suggest methods to mitigate dephasing and relaxation channels\nthat are introduced in this coupling scheme. This analysis gives a clear route\ntoward the realization of coherent state transfer between a microwave resonator\nand a single electron spin in a GaAs double quantum dot with a fidelity above\n90%. Improved dynamical decoupling sequences, low-noise environments, and\nlonger-lived microwave cavity modes may lead to substantially higher fidelities\nin the near future.\n", "  We study theoretically the asymptotic behavior of the Shiba bound states\nassociated with magnetic impurities embedded in both 2D and 1D anomalous\nsuperconductors. We calculate analytically the spatial dependence of the local\ndensity of states together with the spin polarization associated with the Shiba\nbound states. We show that the latter quantity exhibits drastic differences\nbetween s-wave and different types of p-wave superconductors. Such properties,\nwhich could be measured using spin-polarized STM, offer therefore a way to\ndiscriminate between singlet and triplet pairing in low-dimensional\nsuperconductors, as well as a way to estimate the amplitude of the triplet\npairing in these systems.\n", "  Based on an almost complete sample of Galactic open star clusters within 1.8\nkpc, we perform a comprehensive statistical analysis of various cluster\nparameters like spatial position, age, size, mass and extinction in order to\nunderstand the general properties of the open cluster system in the Galaxy and\nthe Galactic structure. Based on the distribution of 1241 open clusters about\nthe Galactic plane and in different age bins, we find the average Galactic\nscale height as Zh = 60+/-2 pc for the youngest cluster population having Age\n<700 Myr, however, it increases up to 64+/-2 pc when we also include older\npopulation of clusters. The solar offset is found to be 6.2+/-1.1 pc above the\nformal Galactic plane. We derive a local mass density of \\rho_0 = 0.090+/-0.005\nMsun/pc^3 and found a negligibly small amount of dark matter in the solar\nneighbourhood. The reddening in the direction of clusters suggests a strong\ncorrelation with their vertical distance from the Galactic plane having a\nrespective slope of dE(B-V)/dz = 0.40+/-0.04 and 0.42+/-0.05 mag/kpc below and\nabove the GP. We observe a linear mass-radius and mass-age relations in the\nopen clusters and derive a slope of dR/d(logM) = 2.08+/-0.10 and\nd(logM)/d(logT) = -0.36+/-0.05,respectively.\n", "  We propose and analyse a scheme for single-rail-encoded arbitrary multi-qubit\nquantum-state generation to provide a versatile tool for quantum optics and\nquantum information applications. Our scheme can be realized, for small numbers\nof qubits, with current technologies using single photon inputs, passive linear\noptics, and heralding measurements. The particular examples of two- and\nthree-qubit cluster states are studied in detail. We show that such states can\nbe prepared with a high probability of success. Our analysis quantifies the\neffects of experimentally relevant imperfections and inefficiencies. The\ngeneral case of arbitrary N-qubit preparation is discussed and some interesting\nconnections to the boson sampling problem are given.\n", "  We consider the most minimal scale invariant extension of the standard model\nthat allows for successful radiative electroweak symmetry breaking and\ninflation. The framework involves an extra scalar singlet, that plays the\nr\\^ole of the inflaton, and is compatibile with current experimental bounds\nowing to the non-minimal coupling of the latter to gravity. This inflationary\nscenario predicts a very low tensor-to-scalar ratio $r \\approx 10^{-3}$,\ntypical of Higgs-inflation models, but in contrast yields a scalar spectral\nindex $n_s \\simeq 0.97$ which departs from the Starobinsky limit. We briefly\ndiscuss the collider phenomenology of the framework.\n", "  Nanometre-scale pores and capillaries have long been studied because of their\nimportance in many natural phenomena and their use in numerous applications. A\nmore recent development is the ability to fabricate artificial capillaries with\nnanometre dimensions, which has enabled new research on molecular transport and\nled to the emergence of nanofluidics. But surface roughness in particular makes\nit challenging to produce capillaries with precisely controlled dimensions at\nthis spatial scale. Here we report the fabrication of narrow and smooth\ncapillaries through van der Waals assembly, with atomically flat sheets at the\ntop and bottom separated by spacers made of two-dimensional crystals with a\nprecisely controlled number of layers. We use graphene and its multilayers as\narchetypal two-dimensional materials to demonstrate this technology, which\nproduces structures that can be viewed as if individual atomic planes had been\nremoved from a bulk crystal to leave behind flat voids of a height chosen with\natomic-scale precision. Water transport through the channels, ranging in height\nfrom one to several dozen atomic planes, is characterized by unexpectedly fast\nflow (up to 1 metre per second) that we attribute to high capillary pressures\n(about 1,000 bar) and large slip lengths. For channels that accommodate only a\nfew layers of water, the flow exhibits a marked enhancement that we associate\nwith an increased structural order in nanoconfined water. Our work opens up an\navenue to making capillaries and cavities with sizes tunable to {\\aa}ngstr\\\"om\nprecision, and with permeation properties further controlled through a wide\nchoice of atomically flat materials available for channel walls.\n", "  A smooth function of the second moments of $N$ continuous variables gives\nrise to an uncertainty relation if it is bounded from below. We present a\nmethod to systematically derive such bounds by generalizing an approach applied\npreviously to a single continuous variable. New uncertainty relations are\nobtained for multi-partite systems which allow one to distinguish entangled\nfrom separable states. We also investigate the geometry of the \"uncertainty\nregion\" in the $N(2N+1)$-dimensional space of moments. It is shown to be a\nconvex set for any number continuous variables, and the points on its boundary\nfound to be in one-to-one correspondence with pure Gaussian states of minimal\nuncertainty. For a single degree of freedom, the boundary can be visualized as\none sheet of a \"Lorentz-invariant\" hyperboloid in the three-dimensional pace of\nsecond moments.\n", "  We analyze an AC-driven dimer chain connected to a strongly biased electron\nsource and drain. It turns out that the resulting transport exhibits\nfingerprints of topology. They are particularly visible in the driving-induced\ncurrent suppression and the Fano factor. Thus, shot noise measurements provide\na topological phase diagram as a function of the driving parameters. The\nobserved phenomena can be explained physically by a mapping to an effective\ntime-independent Hamiltonian and the emergence of edge states. Moreover, by\nconsidering quantum dissipation, we determine the requirements for the\ncoherence properties in a possible experimental realization. For the\ncomputation of the zero-frequency noise, we develop an efficient method based\non matrix-continued fractions.\n", "  The Poisson's ratio of a material characterizes its response to uniaxial\nstrain. Materials normally possess a positive Poisson's ratio - they contract\nlaterally when stretched, and expand laterally when compressed. A negative\nPoisson's ratio is theoretically permissible but has not, with few exceptions\nof man-made bulk structures, been experimentally observed in any natural\nmaterials. Here, we show that the negative Poisson's ratio exists in the\nlow-dimensional natural material black phosphorus, and that our experimental\nobservations are consistent with first principles simulations. Through\napplication of uniaxial strain along zigzag and armchair directions, we find\nthat both interlayer and intralayer negative Poisson's ratios can be obtained\nin black phosphorus. The phenomenon originates from the puckered structure of\nits in-plane lattice, together with coupled hinge-like bonding configurations.\n", "  Searches for a light sterile neutrino have been performed independently by\nthe MINOS and the Daya Bay experiments using the muon (anti)neutrino and\nelectron antineutrino disappearance channels, respectively. In this Letter,\nresults from both experiments are combined with those from the Bugey-3 reactor\nneutrino experiment to constrain oscillations into light sterile neutrinos. The\nthree experiments are sensitive to complementary regions of parameter space,\nenabling the combined analysis to probe regions allowed by the LSND and\nMiniBooNE experiments in a minimally extended four-neutrino flavor framework.\nStringent limits on $\\sin^2 2\\theta_{\\mu e}$ are set over 6 orders of magnitude\nin the sterile mass-squared splitting $\\Delta m^2_{41}$. The sterile-neutrino\nmixing phase space allowed by the LSND and MiniBooNE experiments is excluded\nfor $\\Delta m^2_{41} < 0.8$ eV$^2$ at 95% CL$_s$.\n", "  We study topological stability of nodes in nonsymmorphic superconductors\n(SCs). In particular, we demonstrate that line nodes in nonsymmirphic\nodd-parity SCs are protected by the interplay between topology and\nnonsymmorphic symmetry. As an example, it is shown that the\n$E_{2u}$-superconducting state of UPt$_3$ hosts the topologically stable line\nnode at the Brillouin zone face. Our theory indicates that the existence of\nspin-orbit coupling is essential for protecting such a line node, complementing\nthe Norman's group theory argument. Developing the topological arguments, we\nalso argue generalization to point nodes and to other symmetry cases beyond the\ngroup theory arguments.\n", "  We investigate geodesic completeness in the full family of pp-wave or\nBrinkmann spacetimes in their extended as well as in their impulsive form. This\nclass of geometries contains the recently studied gyratonic pp-waves, modelling\nthe exterior field of a spinning beam of null particles, as well as NPWs, which\ngeneralise classical pp-waves by allowing for a general wave surface. The\nproblem of geodesic completeness reduces to the question of completeness of\ntrajectories on a Riemannian manifold under an external force field. Building\nupon respective recent results we derive completeness criteria in terms of the\nspatial asymptotics of the profile function in the extended case. In the\nimpulsive case we use a fixed point argument to show that irrespective of the\nbehaviour of the profile function all geometries in the class are complete.\n", "  We report on a dark matter search for a Weakly Interacting Massive Particle\n(WIMP) in the mass range $m_\\chi \\in [4, 30]\\,\\mathrm{GeV}/c^2$ with the\nEDELWEISS-III experiment. A 2D profile likelihood analysis is performed on data\nfrom eight selected detectors with the lowest energy thresholds leading to a\ncombined fiducial exposure of 496 kg-days. External backgrounds from $\\gamma$-\nand $\\beta$-radiation, recoils from $^{206}$Pb and neutrons as well as detector\nintrinsic backgrounds were modelled from data outside the region of interest\nand constrained in the analysis. The basic data selection and most of the\nbackground models are the same as those used in a previously published analysis\nbased on Boosted Decision Trees (BDT). For the likelihood approach applied in\nthe analysis presented here, a larger signal efficiency and a subtraction of\nthe expected background lead to a higher sensitivity, especially for the lowest\nWIMP masses probed. No statistically significant signal was found and upper\nlimits on the spin-independent WIMP-nucleon scattering cross section can be set\nwith a hypothesis test based on the profile likelihood test statistics. The 90%\nC.L. exclusion limit set for WIMPs with $m_\\chi = 4\\,\\mathrm{GeV/}c^2$ is $1.6\n\\times 10^{-39}\\,\\mathrm{cm^2}$, which is an improvement of a factor of seven\nwith respect to the BDT-based analysis. For WIMP masses above\n$15\\,\\mathrm{GeV/}c^2$ the exclusion limits found with both analyses are in\ngood agreement.\n", "  To establish the microscopic model of the compound BiCu$_2$PO$_6$ is a\nchallenging task. Inelastic neutron scattering experiments showed that the\ndispersion of this material is non-degenerate suggesting the existence of\nanisotropic interactions. Here we present a quantitative description of the\nexcitation spectrum for BiCu$_2$PO$_6$ on the one-particle level. The solution\nof the isotropic frustrated spin ladder by continuous unitary transformations\nis the starting point of our approach. Further couplings such as isotropic\ninterladder couplings and anisotropic interactions are included on the\nmean-field level. Our aim is to establish a minimal model built on the symmetry\nallowed interactions and to find a set of parameters, which allow us to\ndescribe the low-energy part of the dispersion without assuming unrealistic\ncouplings.\n", "  In this paper, we study analytically the process of external generation and\nsubsequent free evolution of the lepton chiral asymmetry and helical magnetic\nfields in the early hot universe. This process is known to be affected by the\nAbelian anomaly of the electroweak gauge interactions. As a consequence, chiral\nasymmetry in the fermion distribution generates magnetic fields of non-zero\nhelicity, and vice versa. We take into account the presence of thermal bath,\nwhich serves as a seed for the development of instability in magnetic field in\nthe presence of externally generated lepton chiral asymmetry. The developed\nhelical magnetic field and lepton chiral asymmetry support each other,\nconsiderably prolonging their mutual existence, in the process of `inverse\ncascade' transferring magnetic-field power from small to large spatial scales.\nFor cosmologically interesting initial conditions, the chiral asymmetry and the\nenergy density of helical magnetic field are shown to evolve by scaling laws,\neffectively depending on a single combined variable. In this case, the\nlate-time asymptotics of the conformal chiral chemical potential reproduces the\nuniversal scaling law previously found in the literature for the system under\nconsideration. This regime is terminated at lower temperatures because of\nscattering of electrons with chirality change, which exponentially washes out\nchiral asymmetry. We derive an expression for the termination temperature as a\nfunction of the chiral asymmetry and energy density of helical magnetic field.\n", "  We study the level structure of excitations at the \"deconfined\" critical\npoint separating antiferromagnetic and valence-bond-solid phases in\ntwo-dimensional quantum spin systems using the $J$-$Q$ model as an example.\nEnergy gaps in different spin ($S$) and momentum (${\\bf k}$) sectors are\nextracted from imaginary-time correlation functions obtained in quantum Monte\nCarlo simulations. We find strong quantitative evidence for deconfined linearly\ndispersing spinons with gapless points at ${\\bf k}=(0,0)$, $(\\pi,0)$,\n$(0,\\pi)$, and $(\\pi,\\pi)$, as inferred from two-spinon excitations ($S=0$ and\n$S=1$ states) around these points. We also observe a duality between singlet\nand triplet excitations at the critical point and inside the ordered phases, in\nsupport of an enhanced symmetry, possibly SO(5).\n", "  We study the existence and stability of fundamental bright discrete solitons\nin a parity-time (PT)-symmetric coupler composed by a chain of dimers, that is\nmodelled by linearly coupled discrete nonlinear Schrodinger equations with gain\nand loss terms. We use a perturbation theory for small coupling between the\nlattices to perform the analysis, which is then confirmed by numerical\ncalculations. Such analysis is based on the concept of the so-called\nanti-continuum limit approach. We consider the fundamental onsite and intersite\nbright solitons. Each solution has symmetric and antisymmetric configurations\nbetween the arms. The stability of the solutions is then determined by solving\nthe corresponding eigenvalue problem. We obtain that both symmetric and\nantisymmetric onsite mode can be stable for small coupling, on the contrary of\nthe reported continuum limit where the antisymmetric solutions are always\nunstable. The instability is either due to the internal modes crossing the\norigin or the appearance of a quartet of complex eigenvalues. In general, the\ngain-loss term can be considered parasitic as it reduces the stability region\nof the onsite solitons. Additionally, we analyse the dynamic behaviour of the\nonsite and intersite solitons when unstable, where typically it is either in\nthe form of travelling solitons or soliton blow-ups.\n", "  In this paper we show how to obtain from a scalar superfield its first\ncomponent via a similarity transformation. We prove that in D=4 the generators\nof this similarity transformation live in the enveloping algebra of\nsupersymmetry while for D=1 they belong to the basic algebra.\n", "  We establish an experimental method for a detailed investigation of inelastic\ncollisional properties between ytterbium (Yb) in the metastable\n${}^3\\mathrm{P}_2$ state and ground state lithium (Li). By combining an optical\nlattice and a direct excitation to the ${}^3\\mathrm{P}_2$ state we achieve high\nselectivity on the collisional partners. Using this method we determine\ninelastic loss coefficients in collisions between\n$^{174}$Yb(${}^3\\mathrm{P}_2$) with magnetic sublevels of $m_J=0$ and $-2$ and\nground state $^6$Li to be $(4.4\\pm0.3)\\times10^{-11}~\\mathrm{cm}^3/\\mathrm{s}$\nand $(4.7\\pm0.8)\\times10^{-11}~\\mathrm{cm}^3/\\mathrm{s}$, respectively. Absence\nof spin changing processes in Yb(${}^3\\mathrm{P}_2$)-Li inelastic collisions at\nlow magnetic fields is confirmed by inelastic loss measurements on the $m_J=0$\nstate. We also demonstrate that our method allows us to look into loss\nprocesses in few-body systems separately.\n", "  Ever since the discovery of high-Tc superconductivity in layered cuprates,\nthe roles that individual layers play have been debated, due to difficulty in\nlayer-by-layer characterization. While there is similar challenge in many\nFe-based layered superconductors, the newly-discovered Ca10(Pt4As8)(Fe2As2)5\nprovides opportunities to explore superconductivity layer by layer, because it\ncontains both superconducting building blocks (Fe2As2 layers) and intermediate\nPt4As8 layers. Cleaving a single crystal under ultra-high vacuum results in\nmultiple terminations: an ordered Pt4As8 layer, two reconstructed Ca layers on\nthe top of a Pt4As8 layer, and disordered Ca layer on the top of Fe2As2 layer.\nThe electronic properties of individual layers are studied using scanning\ntunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/S), which reveals different spectra for\neach surface. Remarkably superconducting coherence peaks are seen only on the\nordered Ca/Pt4As8 layer. Our results indicate that an ordered structure with\nproper charge balance is required in order to preserve superconductivity.\n", "  The gadolinium pyrochlores, Gd$_2B_2$O$_7$, are amongst the best realizations\nof antiferromagnetically coupled Heisenberg spins on a pyrochlore lattice. We\npresent a magnetic characterization of Gd$_2$Pt$_2$O$_7$, a unique member of\nthis family. Magnetic susceptibility, heat capacity, and muon spin relaxation\nmeasurements show that Gd$_2$Pt$_2$O$_7$ undergoes an antiferromagnetic\nordering transition at $T_N = 1.6$ K. This transition is strongly first order,\nas indicated by the sharpness of the heat capacity anomaly, thermal hysteresis\nin the magnetic susceptibility, and a non-divergent relaxation rate in $\\mu$SR.\nThe form of the heat capacity below $T_N$ suggests that the ground state is an\nanisotropic collinear antiferromagnet with an excitation spectrum that is\ngapped by 0.245(1) meV. The ordering temperature in Gd$_2$Pt$_2$O$_7$, $T_N =\n1.6$ K, is a substantial 160% increase from other gadolinium pyrochlores, which\nhave been found to order at 1 K or lower. We attribute this enhancement in\n$T_N$ to the $B$-site cation, platinum, which, despite being non-magnetic, has\na filled $5d$ $t_{2g}$ orbital and an empty $5d$ $e_g$ orbital that can\nfacilitate superexchange. Thus, the magnetic frustration in Gd$_2$Pt$_2$O$_7$\nis partially \"relieved\", thereby promoting magnetic order.\n", "  Most, if not all, young stars are initially surrounded by protoplanetary\ndisks. Owing to the preferential formation of stars in stellar clusters, the\nprotoplanetary disks around these stars may potentially be affected by the\ncluster environment. Various works have investigated the influence of stellar\nfly-bys on disks, although many of them consider only the effects due to\nparabolic, coplanar encounters often for equal-mass stars, which is only a very\nspecial case. We perform numerical simulations to study the fate of\nprotoplanetary disks after the impact of parabolic star-disk encounter for the\nless investigated case of inclined up to coplanar, retrograde encounters, which\nis a much more common case. Here, we concentrate on the disk size after such\nencounters because this limits the size of the potentially forming planetary\nsystems. In addition, with the possibilities that ALMA offers, now a direct\ncomparison to observations is possible. Covering a wide range of periastron\ndistances and mass ratios between the mass of the perturber and central star,\nwe find that despite the prograde, coplanar encounters having the strongest\neffect on the disk size, inclined and even the least destructive retrograde\nencounters mostly also have a considerable effect, especially for close\nperiastron passages. Interestingly, we find a nearly linear dependence of the\ndisk size on the orbital inclination for the prograde encounters, but not for\nthe retrograde case. We also determine the final orbital parameters of the\nparticles in the disk such as eccentricities, inclinations, and semi-major\naxes. Using this information the presented study can be used to describe the\nfate of disks and also that of planetary systems after inclined encounters.\n", "  In this paper, a multiple-relaxation-time (MRT) lattice Boltzmann (LB) model\nis proposed for convection heat transfer in porous media under local thermal\nnon-equilibrium (LTNE) condition. The model is constructed within the framework\nof the three-distribution-function approach: two temperature-based MRT-LB\nequations are proposed for the temperature fields of fluid and solid phases in\naddition to the MRT-LB equation of a density distribution function for the\nvelocity field described by the generalized non-Darcy model. The thermal\nnon-equilibrium effects are incorporated into the model by adding source terms\ninto the temperature-based MRT-LB equations. Moreover, the discrete lattice\neffects are considered in the introduction of source terms into the\ntemperature-based MRT-LB equations. The source terms accounting for the thermal\nnon-equilibrium effects are simple and the model retains the inherent features\nof the standard LB method. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed\nmodel can be served as an accurate and efficient numerical method for studying\nconvection heat transfer in porous media under LTNE condition.\n", "  The progress in exploiting new electronic materials and devices has been a\nmajor driving force in solid-state physics. As a new state of matter, a Weyl\nsemimetal (WSM), particularly a type-II WSM, hosts Weyl fermions as emergent\nquasiparticles and may harbor novel electrical transport properties because of\nthe exotic Fermi surface. Nevertheless, such a type-II WSM material has not\nbeen experimentally observed in nature. In this work, by performing systematic\nmagneto-transport studies on thin films of a predicted material candidate WTe2,\nwe observe notable angle-sensitive (between the electric and magnetic fields)\nnegative longitudinal magnetoresistance (MR), which can likely be attributed to\nthe chiral anomaly in WSM. This phenomenon also exhibits strong planar\norientation dependence with the absence of negative longitudinal MR along the\ntungsten chains (a axis), which is consistent with the distinctive feature of a\ntype-II WSM. By applying a gate voltage, we demonstrate that the Fermi energy\ncan be tuned through the Weyl points via the electric field effect; this is the\nfirst report of controlling the unique transport properties in situ in a WSM\nsystem. Our results have important implications for investigating simulated\nquantum field theory in solid-state systems and may open opportunities for\nimplementing new types of electronic applications, such as field-effect chiral\nelectronic devices.\n", "  We address the properties of fully three-dimensional solitons in complex\nparity-time (PT)-symmetric periodic lattices with focusing Kerr nonlinearity,\nand uncover that such lattices can stabilize both, fundamental and\nvortex-carrying soliton states. The imaginary part of the lattice induces\ninternal currents in the solitons that strongly affect their domains of\nexistence and stability. The domain of stability for fundamental solitons can\nextend nearly up to the PT-symmetry breaking point, where the linear lattice\nspectrum becomes complex. Vortex solitons feature spatially asymmetric profiles\nin the PT-symmetric lattices, but they are found to still exist as stable\nstates within narrow regions. Our results provide the first example of\ncontinuous families of stable three-dimensional propagating solitons supported\nby complex potentials.\n", "  Topological insulators host spin-polarized surface states born out of the\nenergetic inversion of bulk bands driven by the spin-orbit interaction. Here we\ndiscover previously unidentified consequences of band-inversion on the surface\nelectronic structure of the topological insulator Bi$_2$Se$_3$. By performing\nsimultaneous spin, time, and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we map\nthe spin-polarized unoccupied electronic structure and identify a surface\nresonance which is distinct from the topological surface state, yet shares a\nsimilar spin- orbital texture with opposite orientation. Its momentum-\ndependence and spin texture imply an intimate connection with the topological\nsurface state. Calculations show these two distinct states can emerge from\ntrivial Rashba-like states that change topology through the spin-orbit-induced\nband inversion. This work thus provides a compelling view of the coevolution of\nsurface states through a topological phase transition, enabled by the unique\ncapability of directly measuring the spin-polarized unoccupied band structure.\n", "  This paper studies fault-tolerant quantum computation with gapped boundaries.\nWe first introduce gapped boundaries of Kitaev's quantum double models for\nDijkgraaf-Witten theories using their Hamiltonian realizations. We classify the\nelementary excitations on the boundary, and systematically describe the\nbulk-to-boundary condensation procedure. We also provide a commuting\nHamiltonian to realize defects between boundaries in any quantum double model.\nNext, we present the algebraic/categorical structure of gapped boundaries and\nboundary defects, which will be used to describe topologically protected\noperations and obtain quantum gates. To demonstrate a potential physical\nrealization, we provide quantum circuits for surface codes that can perform all\nbasic operations on gapped boundaries. Finally, we show how gapped boundaries\nof the abelian theory $\\mathfrak{D}(\\mathbb{Z}_3)$ can be used to perform\nuniversal quantum computation.\n", "  Surface nanobubbles are stable gaseous phases in liquids that form on solid\nsubstrates. While their existence has been confirmed, there are many open\nquestions related to their formation and dissolution processes along with their\nstructures and properties, which are difficult to investigate experimentally.\nTo address these issues, we carried out molecular dynamics simulations based on\natomistic force fields for systems comprised of water, air (N2 and O2), and a\nHighly Oriented Pyrolytic Graphite (HOPG) substrate. Our results provide\ninsights into the formation/dissolution mechanisms of nanobubbles and estimates\nfor their density, contact angle, and surface tension. We found that the\nformation of nanobubbles is driven by an initial nucleation process of air\nmolecules and the subsequent coalescence of the formed air clusters. The\nclusters form favorably on the substrate, which provides an enhanced stability\nto the clusters. In contrast, nanobubbles formed in the bulk either move\nrandomly to the substrate and spread or move to the water--air surface and pop\nimmediately. Moreover, nanobubbles consist of a condensed gaseous phase with a\nsurface tension smaller than that of an equivalent system under atmospheric\nconditions, and contact angles larger than those in the equivalent nanodroplet\ncase. We anticipate that this study will provide useful insights into the\nphysics of nanobubbles and will stimulate further research in the field by\nusing all-atom simulations.\n", "  We find that the ratio r_{mu e} of the muon to the electromagnetic component\nof an extended air shower at the ground level provides an indirect measure of\nthe depth X_{max} of the shower maximum. This result, obtained with the\nair-shower code AIRES, is independent of the hadronic model used in the\nsimulation. We show that the value of r_{mu e} in a particular shower\ndiscriminates its proton or iron nature with a 98% efficiency. We also show\nthat the eventual production of forward heavy quarks inside the shower may\nintroduce anomalous values of r_{mu e} in isolated events.\n", "  We discuss the statistics of first-passage times of a Brownian particle\nmoving in a highly unstable nonlinear potential proportional to an odd power of\nposition. We observe temperature-induced shortening of the mean first-passage\ntime and its dependence on the power of nonlinearity. We propose a passage-time\nfraction as both a simple and experimentally detectable witness of the\nnonlinearity. It is advantageously independent of all other parameters of the\nexperiment and observable for a small number of trajectories. To better\ncharacterize the stochastic passage in the unstable potential, we introduce an\nanalogy of the signal-to-noise ratio for the statistical distribution of the\nfirst-passage times. Interestingly, the upper bound for the signal-to-noise\nratio is temperature independent in the unstable potential. Finally, we\ndescribe the nonequilibrium steady state of the particle cyclically passing\nthrough unstable odd nonlinearity. The maximum of the steady-state probability\ndistribution shifts against the directions of the current and this\ncounterintuitive effect increases with temperature. All these thermally induced\neffects are very promising targets for experimental tests of highly nonlinear\nstochastic dynamics of particles placed into optical potential landscapes of\nshaped optical tweezers.\n", "  A simple expression for the uniform electron gas (UEG) correlation energy,\nrecently presented in Ref. [J. Chem. Phys. 145, 021101 (2016)], deviates from\nthe reference quantum Monte-Carlo (QMC) data at large r_s. We propose to define\none of the parameters from a requirement to match the large-rs QMC data.\nFunctional with the new parameter provides much better agreement with the QMC\ndata at large r_s without deterioration of the functional quality at small and\nintermediate r_s.\n", "  Auxetic materials (materials with negative Poisson's ratio) and nanomaterials\nhave independently been for many years two of the most active research fields\nin material science. Recently, these formerly independent fields have begun to\nintersect in new and interesting ways due to the recent discovery of auxeticity\nin nanomaterials like graphene, metal nanoplates, black phosphorus, and others.\nHere we review the research emerging at the intersection of auxeticity and\nnanomaterials. We first survey the atomistic mechanisms, both intrinsic and\nextrinsic, that have been found, primarily through atomistic simulations, to\ncause auxeticity in nanomaterials. We then outline the available experimental\nevidence for auxetic nanomaterials. In order to lay the groundwork for future\nwork in this exciting area, we close by discussing several future prospects as\nwell as the current challenges in this field.\n", "  We investigate the energy dynamics in a generalized compass chain under an\nexternal magnetic field. We show that the energy current operators act on three\ncontiguous sites in the absence of the magnetic field, and they are\nincorporated with inhomogenous Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions in the\npresence of the magnetic field. These complex interactions remain the\nHamiltonian be an exactly solvable spin model. We study the effects of the\nthree-site interactions and the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions on the\nenergy spectra and phase diagram. The results have revealed that the energy\ncurrent of the pristine quantum compass model is conserved due to the\nassociated intermediate symmetries, and for other general cases such\ncharacteristic does not exist.\n", "  In this paper, we investigate the accretion on the Reissner-Nordstr\\\"{o}m\nanti-de-Sitter black hole with global monopole charge. We discuss the general\nsolutions of accretion using the isothermal and polytropic equations of state\nfor steady state, spherically symmetric, non-rotating accretion on the black\nhole. In the case of isothermal flow, we consider some specific fluids and\nderive their solutions at the sonic point as well. However, in case of\npolytropic fluid we calculate the general expressions only, as there exists no\nglobal (Bondi) solutions for polytropic test fluids. In addition to this, the\neffect of fluid on the mass accretion rate are also studied. Moreover, the\nlarge monopole parameter $\\beta$ greatly suppresses the maximum accretion rate.\n", "  Ivory's Lemma is a geometrical statement in the heart of J. Ivory's\ncalculation of the gravitational potential of a homeoidal shell. In the\nsimplest planar case, it claims that the diagonals of a curvilinear\nquadrilateral made by arcs of confocal ellipses and hyperbolas are equal.\n  In the first part of this paper, we deduce Ivory's Lemma and its numerous\ngeneralizations from complete integrability of billiards on conics and\nquadrics. In the second part, we study analogs of Ivory's Lemma in Liouville\nand St\\\"ackel metrics. Our main focus is on the results of the German school of\ndifferential geometry obtained in the late 19 -- early 20th centuries that\nmight be lesser know today.\n  In the third part, we generalize Newton's, Laplace's, and Ivory's theorems on\ngravitational and Coulomb potential of spheres and ellipsoids to the spherical\nand hyperbolic spaces. V. Arnold extended the results of Newton, Laplace, and\nIvory to algebraic hypersurfaces in Euclidean space; we generalize Arnold's\ntheorem to the spaces of constant curvature.\n", "  We report measurements of the bias dependence of the Fano factor in ensembles\nof atomic-scale Au junctions at 77 K. Previous measurements of shot noise at\nroom temperature and low biases have found good agreement of the Fano factor\nwith the expectations of the Landauer- B\\\"uttiker formalism, while enhanced\nFano factors have been observed at biases of hundreds of mV [R. Chen et al.,\nSci. Rep. 4, 4221 (2014)]. We find even stronger enhancement of shot noise at\n77 K with an \"excess\" Fano factor up to ten times the low bias value. We\ndiscuss the observed ensemble Fano factor bias dependence in terms of candidate\nmodels. The results are most consistent with either a bias-dependent channel\nmixing picture or a model incorporating noise enhancement due to\ncurrent-driven, nonequilibrium phonon populations, though a complete\ntheoretical treatment of the latter in the ensemble average limit is needed.\n", "  The Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson Hamiltonian with random temperature for the phase\ntransition in disordered systems from the Griffiths phase to ferromagnetic\nphase is reexamined. From the saddle point solutions, especially the excited\nstate solutions, it is shown that the system self-organizes into blocks coupled\nwith their neighbors like superspins, which are emergent variables. Taking the\nfluctuation around these saddle point solutions into account, we get an\neffective Hamiltonian, including the emergent superspins of the blocks, the\nfluctuation around the saddle point solutions, and their couplings. Applying\nStratonovich-Hubbard transformation to the part of superspins, we get a\nLandau-Ginzburg-Wilson Hamiltonian for the blocks. From the saddle point\nequations for the blocks, we can get the second generation blocks, of which\nsizes are much larger than the first generation blocks. Repeating this\nprocedure again and again, we get many generations of blocks to describe the\nasymptotic behavior. If a field is applied, the effective field on the\nsuperspins is multiplied greatly and proportional to the block size. For a very\nsmall field, the effective field on the higher generation superspins can be so\nstrong to cause the superspins polarizaed radically. This can explain the extra\nlarge critical isotherm exponent discovered in the experiments. The phase space\nof reduced temperature vs. field is divided into many layers , in which\ndifferent generation blocks dominate the critical behavior. The sizes of the\ndifferent generation emergent blocks are new relevant length scales. This can\nexplain a lot of puzzles in the experiments and the Monte Carlo simulation.\n", "  We consider the nonlinear problem of determining a connection and a Higgs\nfield from the corresponding parallel transport along geodesics on a Riemannian\nmanifold with boundary, in any dimension. The problem can be reduced to an\nintegral geometry question of some attenuated geodesic ray transform through a\npseudolinearization argument. We show injectivity (up to natural obstructions)\nand stability estimates for both the linear and nonlinear problems for generic\nsimple metrics and generic connections and Higgs fields, including the\nreal-analytic ones. We consider the problems on simple manifolds in order to\nmake the exposition of the main ideas clear and concise, many results of this\npaper are still true under much weaker geometric assumptions, in particular\nconjugate points and trapped geodesics are allowed and the boundary is not\nnecessarily convex.\n", "  Horndeski/Galileons may be considered as a proper generalization of General\nRelativity in high energy regime. Thus one may search for manifestation of\nGalileons interaction in collision experiments. In this paper we give arguments\nsupporting this thesis. Galileon scalar field do not interact with matter via\nStandard Model interactions, we discuss a mechanism that allows Galileons to\nhave influence on particle collisions. We give reasons to narrow the whole\nclass of Horndeski/Galileons models to one particular term - John term from Fab\nFour subclass - for this particular issue. We were able to establish the\nconstraint on the model coupling constant.\n", "  We investigate polarization memory effects in single-crystal CuFeO2, which\nhas a magnetically-induced ferroelectric phase at low temperatures and applied\nB fields between 7.5 and 13 T. Following electrical poling of the ferroelectric\nphase, we find that the nonpolar collinear antiferromagnetic ground state at B\n= 0 T retains a strong memory of the polarization magnitude and direction, such\nthat upon re-entering the ferroelectric phase a net polarization of comparable\nmagnitude to the initial polarization is recovered in the absence of external\nbias. This memory effect is very robust: in pulsed-magnetic-field measurements,\nseveral pulses into the ferroelectric phase with reverse bias are required to\nswitch the polarization direction, with significant switching only seen after\nthe system is driven out of the ferroelectric phase and ground state either\nmagnetically (by application of B > 13 T) or thermally. The memory effect is\nalso largely insensitive to the magnetoelastic domain composition, since no\nchange in the memory effect is observed for a sample driven into a\nsingle-domain state by application of stress in the [1-10] direction. On the\nbasis of Monte Carlo simulations of the ground state spin configurations, we\npropose that the memory effect is due to the existence of helical domain walls\nwithin the nonpolar collinear antiferromagnetic ground state, which would\nretain the helicity of the polar phase for certain magnetothermal histories.\n", "  Momentum relaxation is an ever-present and unavoidable ingredient of any\nrealistic condensed matter system. In real-world materials the presence of a\nlattice, impurities or disorder forces momentum to dissipate and leads to\nrelevant physical effects such as the finiteness of the DC transport\nproperties, i.e. conductivities. The main purpose of this thesis is the\nintroduction of momentum dissipation and its consequent effects into the\nframework of AdS/CMT, namely the applications of the gauge-gravity duality to\ncondensed matter. A convenient and effective way of breaking the translational\nsymmetry associated to such a conservation law is provided by massive gravity\n(MG) bulk theories. We consider generic massive gravity models embedded into\nasymptotically Anti de Sitter spacetime and we analyze them using holographic\ntechniques. We study in detail their consistency and stability. We then focus\nour attention on the transport properties of the CFT duals. A big part of our\nwork is devoted to the analysis of the electric conductivity in relation to\npossible universal bounds and the existence of holographic metal-insulator\ntransitions. We moreover initiate the study of the viscoelastic response and we\nconsider the possible violation of the well known KSS bound. We finally\ndescribe the effects of momentum relaxation on the well known holographic\nmodels for superconductivity.\n", "  Deciphering the role of clouds is central to our understanding of exoplanet\natmospheres, as they have a direct impact on the temperature and pressure\nstructure, and observational properties of the planet. Super-hot Jupiters\noccupy a temperature regime similar to low mass M-dwarfs, where minimal cloud\ncondensation is expected. However, observations of exoplanets such as WASP-12b\n(Teq ~ 2500 K) result in a transmission spectrum indicative of a cloudy\natmosphere. We re-examine the temperature and pressure space occupied by these\nsuper-hot Jupiter atmospheres, to explore the role of the initial Al- and\nTi-bearing condensates as the main source of cloud material. Due to the high\ntemperatures a majority of the more common refractory material is not depleted\ninto deeper layers and would remain in the vapor phase. The lack of depletion\ninto deeper layers means that these materials with relatively low cloud masses\ncan become significant absorbers in the upper atmosphere. We provide\ncondensation curves for the initial Al- and Ti-bearing condensates that may be\nused to provide quantitative estimates of the effect of metallicity on cloud\nmasses, as planets with metal-rich hosts potentially form more opaque clouds\nbecause more mass is available for condensation. Increased metallicity also\npushes the point of condensation to hotter, deeper layers in the planetary\natmosphere further increasing the density of the cloud. We suggest that planets\naround metal-rich hosts are more likely to have thick refractory clouds, and\ndiscuss the implication on the observed spectra of WASP-12b.\n", "  We study rigidly rotating and pulsating $(m,n)$ strings in $AdS_3 \\times S^3$\nwith mixed three form flux. The $AdS_3 \\times S^3$ background with mixed three\nform flux is obtained in the near horizon limit of $SL(2,Z)$-transformed\nsolution, corresponding to the bound state of NS5-branes and fundamental\nstrings. We study the probe $(m,n)-$string in this background by solving the\nmanifest $SL(2,Z)-$covariant form of the action. We find out the dyonic giant\nmagnon and single spike solutions corresponding to the equations of motion of a\nprobe string in this background and find out various relationships among the\nconserved charges. We further study a class of pulsating $(m,n)$ string in\n$AdS_3$ with mixed three form flux.\n", "  We analyse Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) observations of the\nblazar CGRaBS J0809+5341 using Bayesian inference methods. The observation was\ncarried out at 5 GHz using 8 telescopes that form part of the European VLBI\nNetwork. Imaging and deconvolution using traditional methods imply that the\nblazar is unresolved. To search for source structure beyond the diffraction\nlimit, we perform Bayesian model selection between three source models (point,\nelliptical Gaussian, and circular Gaussian). Our modelling jointly accounts for\nantenna-dependent gains and system equivalent flux densities. We obtain\nposterior distributions for the various source and instrumental parameters\nalong with the corresponding uncertainties and correlations between them. We\nfind that there is very strong evidence (>1e9 :1) in favour of elliptical\nGaussian structure and using this model derive the apparent brightness\ntemperature distribution of the blazar, accounting for uncertainties in the\nshape estimates. To test the integrity of our method, we also perform model\nselection on synthetic observations and use this to develop a Bayesian\ncriterion for the minimum resolvable source size and consequently the maximum\nmeasurable brightness temperature for a given interferometer, dependent on the\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the data incorporating the aforementioned\nsystematics. We find that calibration errors play an increasingly important\nrole in determining the over-resolution limit for SNR>>100. We show that it is\npossible to exploit the resolving power of future VLBI arrays down to about 5\nper cent of the size of the naturally-weighted restoring beam, if the gain\ncalibration is precise to 1 per cent or less.\n", "  An aqueous suspension of the synthetic clay Laponite undergoes a transition\nfrom a liquid-like ergodic state to a glass-like nonergodic arrested state. In\nan observation that closely resembles the dynamical slowdown observed in\nsupercooled liquids, the phenomenon of kinetic arrest in Laponite suspensions\nis accompanied by a growth in the $\\alpha$-relaxation time with increasing\nsample aging time, $t_{w}$. The ubiquitous dynamic slowdown and fragile\nbehavior observed in glass forming liquids approaching the glass transition is\ntypically ascribed to the growth in the size of distinct dynamical\nheterogeneities. In this article, we present the characterization of the\ndynamical heterogeneities in aging colloidal Laponite clay systems by invoking\nthe three-point dynamic susceptibility formalism. The average time-dependent\ntwo-point intensity autocorrelation and its sensitivity to the control\nparameter $t_{w}$ are probed in dynamic light scattering experiments.\nDistributions of relaxation time scales deduced from Kohlrausch-Williams-Watts\nequation widen with increasing $t_{w}$ signifying the heterogeneous dynamic\nslowdown. A suitable formalism to calculate three-point correlation function is\nemployed for aging colloidal suspension where the main control parameter is\n$t_{w}$. The calculated three-point dynamic susceptibility exhibits a peak,\nwith the peak height increasing with evolving $t_{w}$. The number of\ndynamically correlated particles is seen to initially increase with increasing\n$t_{w}$ at a fast rate, before eventually slowing down close to the non-ergodic\ntransition point.This observation is in agreement with reports on supercooled\nliquids. Our study confirms the growth of dynamical heterogeneities in\nsuspensions of Laponite, thereby shedding new light on the fragile supercooled\nliquid-like dynamics of aging suspensions of these anisotropic, charged,\ncolloidal clay nanoparticles.\n", "  We consider a novel dark energy model to investigate whether it will provide\nan expanding universe phase. Here we propose a mixed dark energy domination\nwhich is constituted by tachyon, quintessence, and phantom scalar fields\nnonminimally coupled to gravity, in the absence of background dark matter and\nbaryonic matter, in the framework of teleparallel gravity. We perform the\nphase-space analysis of the model by numerical methods and find the late-time\naccelerated attractor solutions implying the acceleration phase of universe.\n", "  A change in the character of maser generation in a two-level system is found\nwhen the initial population inversion exceeds some threshold value proportional\nto the square root of the total number of atoms. Above this threshold, the\nnumber of photons begins to grow exponentially with time and the pulse with\nshort leading edge and broadened trailing edge is generated. In this work, we\nattempt to explain the nature of this threshold. Coherent pulse duration\nestimated by its half-width increases significantly with increasing inversion,\nif all other parameters are fixed and the absorption is neglected. The\ninclusion of the energy loss of photons leads to the fact that the duration of\ncoherent pulse is almost constant with increasing inversion, at least well away\nfrom the threshold. If there is exist a recovery mechanism for the population\ninversion, the pulsating mode of stimulated emission generation becomes\npossible. The integral radiation intensity at this may be increased several\ntimes. This approach can be used for analysis of the cosmic radiation that\nmight help explain a great variety of pulsating radiation sources in space.\n", "  This paper demonstrates and studies helium atmospheric pressure plasma jet\ncomprised of series of repetitive streamer breakdowns, which is driven by a\npure DC high voltage (auto-oscillations). Repetition frequency of the\nbreakdowns is governed by the geometry of discharge electrodes/surroundings and\ngas flow rate. Each next streamer is initiated when the electric field on the\nanode tip recovers after the previous breakdown and reaches the breakdown\nthreshold value of about 2.5 kV/cm. Repetition frequency of the streamer\nbreakdowns excited using this principle can be simply tuned by reconfiguring\nthe discharge electrode geometry. This custom-designed type of the helium\nplasma jet, which operates on the DC high voltage and is comprised of the\nseries of the repetitive streamer breakdowns at frequency about 13 kHz, is\ndemonstrated.\n", "  Herbertsmithite, ZnCu$_3$(OH)$_6$Cl$_2$, is a two dimensional kagom\\'{e}\nlattice realization of a spin liquid, with evidence for fractionalized\nexcitations and a gapped ground state. Such a quantum spin liquid has been\nproposed to underlie high temperature superconductivity and is predicted to\nproduce a wealth of new states, including a Dirac metal at $1/3$rd electron\ndoping. Here we report the topochemical synthesis of electron-doped\nZnLi$_x$Cu$_3$(OH)$_6$Cl$_2$ from $x$ = 0 to $x$ = 1.8 ($3/5$th per Cu$^{2+}$).\nContrary to expectations, no metallicity or superconductivity is induced.\nInstead, we find a systematic suppression of magnetic behavior across the phase\ndiagram. Our results demonstrate that significant theoretical work is needed to\nunderstand and predict the role of doping in magnetically frustrated narrow\nband insulators, particularly the interplay between local structural disorder\nand tendency toward electron localization, and pave the way for future studies\nof doped spin liquids.\n", "  Enhancements of the comic-ray intensity as observed by detectors on the\nground have been observed 71 times since 1942. They are due to solar energetic\nparticles accelerated in the regions of solar flares deep in the corona, or in\nthe shock front of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) in the solar wind. The latter\nis the favoured model for the classical gradual ground level enhancement (GLE).\nIn several papers since the one of McCracken et al. (2008), we pointed out,\nhowever, that some GLEs are too impulsive to be accelerated in the CME shocks.\nThis hypothesis, together with other properties of GLEs, is demonstrated\ngraphically in this paper by plotting and comparing the time profiles of GLEs\n42 of 29 September 1989 and GLE 69 of 20 January. These two events are\nrespectively the largest examples of gradual and prompt events.\n", "  These brief comments on the article in Phys. Rev. B 93, 155116 (2016),\naddress an inadvertent misrepresentation of the capabilities of density\nfunctional theory (DFT) and of its local density approximation (LDA) in\ndescribing electronic and related properties of materials accurately. The\noversight of some previous LDA results that agree with experiments partly led\nto this unintended misrepresentation, in addition to a few assertions relative\nto perceived deficiencies of DFT.\n", "  In this thesis, I investigate the molecular electronic properties of\nmolecular junctions formed from single molecules. I started my thesis by\ndiscusses the main theoretical methods using in this work density functional\ntheory and the green function formalism of electron transport. These two\ntechniques are used to study the charge transport through dicarboxylic acid\nterminated alkanes in chapter 4, with graphene gold nanogap electrodes. The\nresults are then compared with those using symmetric gold electrodes and reveal\nthat there is a difference between the two situations due to the difference in\nFermi energies relative to the frontier orbitals of the molecules. Furthermore,\nthe electrical conductance in the asymmetric junction is higher than that in\nthe symmetric junction, which suggests that graphene offers superior electrode\nperformance when utilizing carboxylic acid anchor groups. In chapter 5, I study\naffected of the saturated chain conductance by adding oxygen to the chain.\nComparisons between my electronic structure calculations on oligoether chains\nand previous work on alkanes show that the conductance of oligoether is lower\nthan that of alkane chains with the same length. I found that the beta\ntunneling factor per methyl unit of the alkanes is lower than the beta factor\nof oligoether. In the final chapter, molecular dynamic simulations are used to\nexamine the molecular assembly of two candidate molecules for graphene-based\nmolecular electronics, one with one pyrene anchor, Pyrene PEGn exTTF, PPT, and\nthe other with three pyrene anchors, tri pyrene derivative, TPPT, on a\ndisordered graphene surface. PPT is seen to form flat structures whilst TPPT is\nseen to form semicircular cone like micelle structures on the graphene surface.\nIn the presence of water, the PPT tends to aggregate whereas the TPPT micelle\nexpands.\n", "  Chu et al. recently reported extensive results of local density approximation\n(LDA) and of four (4) different Green function and dressed Coulomb (GW)\napproximation calculations of electronic properties of several semiconductors\nand insulators [Phys. Rev. B 93, 125210 (2016)].\n", "  We discuss the basis of polarized positron production by low energy polarized\nelectrons. Efficiency of conversion ~0.1-1% might be interesting for CEBAF\nfacility and ILC as well.\n", "  We report a determination of the complex in-plane dielectric function of\nmonolayers of four transition metal dichalcogenides: MoS2, MoSe2, WS2 and WSe2,\nfor photon energies from 1.5 - 3 eV. The results were obtained from reflection\nspectra using a Kramers-Kronig constrained variational analysis. From the\ndielectric functions, we obtain the absolute absorbance of the monolayers. We\nalso provide a comparison of the dielectric function for the monolayers with\nthe corresponding bulk materials.\n", "  Surface phenomena are increasingly becoming important in exploring nanoscale\nmaterials growth and characterization. Consequently, the need for atomistic\nbased simulations is increasing. Nevertheless, relying entirely on quantum\nmechanical methods limits the length and time scales one can consider,\nresulting in an ever increasing dependence on alternative machine learning\nbased force fields. Recently, we proposed a machine learning approach, known as\nAGNI, that allows fast and accurate atomic force predictions given the atom's\nneighborhood environment. Here, we make use of such force fields to study and\ncharacterize the nanoscale diffusion and growth processes occurring on an Al\n(111) surface. In particular we focus on the adatom ripening phenomena,\nconfirming past experimental findings, wherein a low and high temperature\ngrowth regime were observed, using entirely molecular dynamics simulations.\n", "  It is well known that optical media create artificial geometry for light, and\ncurved geometry acts as an effective optical medium. This correspondence\noriginates from the form invariance of Maxwells equations, which recently has\nspawned a booming field called transformation optics. Here we investigate\nresponses of three transformation media under electromagnetic pulses, and find\nthat pulse radiation can induce unbalanced net force on transformation media,\nwhich will cause translation and rotation of transformation media although\ntheir final momentum can still be zero. Therefore, the transformation media do\nnot necessarily stay the same after an electromagnetic wave passes through.\n", "  Single photon emitters play a central role in many photonic quantum\ntechnologies. A promising class of single photon emitters consists of atomic\ncolor centers in wide-bandgap crystals, such as diamond silicon carbide and\nhexagonal boron nitride. However, it is currently not possible to grow these\nmaterials as sub-micron thick films on low-refractive index substrates, which\nis necessary for mature photonic integrated circuit technologies. Hence, there\nis great interest in identifying quantum emitters in technologically mature\nsemiconductors that are compatible with suitable heteroepitaxies. Here, we\ndemonstrate robust single photon emitters based on defects in gallium nitride\n(GaN), the most established and well understood semiconductor that can emit\nlight over the entire visible spectrum. We show that the emitters have\nexcellent photophysical properties including a brightness in excess of 500x10^3\ncounts/s. We further show that the emitters can be found in a variety of GaN\nwafers, thus offering reliable and scalable platform for further technological\ndevelopment. We propose a theoretical model to explain the origin of these\nemitters based on cubic inclusions in hexagonal gallium nitride. Our results\nconstitute a feasible path to scalable, integrated on-chip quantum technologies\nbased on GaN.\n", "  We propose a method, called as thick-target transmission (T3) method, to\nobtain an excitation function of interaction cross sections. In an ordinal\nexperiment to measure the excitation function of interaction cross sections by\nthe transmission method, we need to change the beam energy for each cross\nsection. In the T3 method, the excitation function is derived from the beam\nattenuations measured at the targets of different thicknesses without changing\nthe beam energy. The advantage of the T3 method is the simplicity and\navailability for radioactive beams. To confirm the availability, we perform a\nsimulation for the 12C+27Al system with the PHITS code instead of actual\nexperiments. Our results have large uncertainties but well reproduce the\ntendency of the experimental data.\n", "  For graphene (a Dirac material) it has been theoretically predicted and\nexperimentally observed that DC resistivity is proportional to $ T^4$ when the\ntemperature is much less than Bloch- Gr\\\"{u}neisen ($\\Theta_{BG}$) temperature\nand T linear in opposite case ($T>>\\Theta_{BG}$). Going beyond the DC case, we\ninvestigate the dynamical conductivity in graphene using the powerful method of\nmemory function formalism. In the DC (zero frequency regime) limit, we obtained\nthe above mention behavior which was previously obtained using the\nBloch-Boltzmann kinetic equation. In the finite frequency regime, we obtained\nseveral new results: (1) the generalized Drude scattering rate, in the zero\ntemperature limit, shows $\\omega^4 $ behavior at low frequencies ($\\omega <<\nk_B \\Theta_{BG}/ \\hbar$) and saturates at higher frequencies. We also observed\nthe Holstein Mechanism, however, with different power laws from that in the\ncase of metals; (2) At higher frequencies, $\\omega>>k_B \\Theta_{BG}/ \\hbar$,\nand higher temperatures $T>>\\Theta_{BG}$, we observed that the generalized\nDrude scattering rate is linear in temperature. In addition, several other\nresults are also obtained. With the experimental advancement of this field,\nthese results should be experimentally tested.\n", "  Viscoelastic liquids are characterized by a finite static viscosity and a\nzero yield stress, whereas soft solids have an infinite viscosity and a\nnon-zero yield stress. The rheological nature of viscoelastic materials has\nlong been a challenge, and it is still a matter of debate. Here, we provide for\nthe first time the constitutive equations of linear viscoelasticity for\nmagnetic wires in yield stress materials, together with experimental\nmeasurements using Magnetic Rotational Spectroscopy (MRS). With MRS, the wires\nare submitted to a rotational magnetic field as a function of frequency and the\nwire motion is monitored by time-lapse microscopy. The soft solids studied are\ngel-forming polysaccharide aqueous dispersions (gellan gum) at concentrations\nabove the gelification point. It is found that soft solids exhibit a clear and\ndistinctive signature compared to viscous and viscoelastic liquids. In\nparticular, the wire average rotation velocity equals zero over a broad\nfrequency range. We also show the MRS technique is quantitative. From the wire\noscillation amplitudes, the equilibrium elastic modulus is retrieved and agrees\nwith polymer dynamics theory.\n", "  The quantum adiabatic theorem ensures that a slowly changing system,\ninitially prepared in its ground state, will evolve to its final ground state\nwith arbitrary precision. As a first result this thesis extends the original\ntheorem to projection operators keeping the statement valid for Hamiltonians\nwith degenerate ground spaces.\n  Yet the main focus of this work lies in studying the efficiency of quantum\ncircuit simulations by adabatic quantum computation. The standard Hamiltonian\nconstruction by Kitaev is based on a path graph reflecting the $L$ computation\nsteps and influencing the scaling of the necessary evolution time by its\nspectral gap of $\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\frac{1}{L^2}\\right)$. Aspiring to an\nimproved running time we generalize Kitaev's Hamiltonian to so-called standard\ngraph Hamiltonians based on graph families with a different spectral gap.\n  In this generalized construction the first two time derivatives of the\nHamiltonian and the fraction of initial vertices appear as additional\nparameters of running time. In a first step the time derivatives can be proven\nto be constant. Expansion results from spectral graph theory however impose a\ntrade-off between the spectral gap and the fraction of initial vertices as well\nas the fraction of final vertices which corresponds to the probability for\nobtaining the correct computational output. Graphs with spectral gap\n$\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\frac{1}{L^k}\\right)$, $k<2$, turn out to contradict very\nlikely, graphs with $k<1$ even for sure at least one of the efficiency\ncriterias for running time, output probability or Hamiltonian implementation.\n  The above results may also be obstacles for a possible quantum PCP-theorem in\ncomplexity theory claiming the local Hamiltonian problem with constant gap to\nbe QMA-complete since the very same Kitaev Hamiltonian is constructed in the\nQMA-hardness proof for the Local Hamiltonian problem.\n", "  We realize a strongly coupled double quantum dot in a single all-organic\nmolecule by introducing a non-conjugated bridge in between two identical\nconjugated moieties. Spin-1/2 Kondo and Kondo enhanced low-energy excitations\nfor respectively the odd and even electron occupation are observed in\noff-resonant transport. The ground state in the even occupation can be the\nsinglet or the triplet state varying between samples. This observation suggests\nthat both anti-ferromagnetic and ferromagnetic interactions between spins are\nof the same order of magnitude.\n", "  In this paper we study the extremality of translation-invariant Gibbs measure\nfor the HC-model on a Cayley tree. It is known that for this model the\ntranslation-invariant measure is unique. We give a new proof of this statement\nand found regions of the extremality of this measure on the Cayley tree of\norder k.\n", "  Clustering network is one of which complex network attracting plenty of\nscholars to discuss and study the structures and cascading process. We\nprimarily analyzed the effect of clustering coefficient to other various of the\nsingle clustering network under localized attack. These network models\nincluding double clustering network and star-like NON with clustering and\nrandom regular (RR) NON of ER networks with clustering are made up of at least\ntwo networks among which exist interdependent relation among whose degree of\ndependence is measured by coupling strength. We show both analytically and\nnumerically, how the coupling strength and clustering coefficient effect the\npercolation threshold, size of giant component, critical coupling point where\nthe behavior of phase transition changes from second order to first order with\nthe increase of coupling strength between the networks. Last, we study the two\ntypes of clustering network: one type is same with double clustering network in\nwhich each subnetwork satisfies identical degree distribution and the other is\nthat their subnetwork satisfies different degree distribution. The former type\nis treated both analytically and numerically while the latter is treated only\nnumerically. In each section, we compared two results obtained from localized\nattack and random attack according to Shao et al:[22].\n", "  Hybrid perovskites (CH3NH3PbI3) is one of the most promising novel materials\nfor solar harvesting. Toxicity of lead (Pb), however, has always remained a\nconcern. We investigated the electronic structure of complete replacement of Pb\nby alkaline earths (Ca, Sr, Ba) and found it to be wide band gapped (Eg)\nsemiconductors (band gap ~ 3.7 to 4.0 eV), and hence not suitable as absorber\nmaterial. This opens up a new avenue to explore these materials as transparent\nconductor (TC). We doped CH3NH3BaI3 (largest Eg) with La, which shifts its\nFermi level (EF) at conduction band bottom and induces states at EF for\nconduction. This is precisely what is required for a transparent conductor.\nOptical and transport properties simulated from linear response (within Density\nFunctional Theory (DFT)) calculations suggested it to be a very good TC\nmaterial with a high figure of merit ({\\sigma}/{\\alpha}), where {\\sigma} is the\nelectrical conductivity and {\\alpha} is the optical absorption coefficient.\nThis claim is also supported by our calculated results on density of states at\nEF, effective mass, carrier concentration etc. at various La-doping. We propose\nCH3NH3(Ba1-xLax)I3 (x~12.5%) to be a good TC material to be used in a all\nperovskite solar cell.\n", "  We present a study of modulation of spin-orbit interaction (SOI) at the\ninterface of LaTiO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ by $\\delta$-doping with an iso-structural\nferromagnetic perovskite LaCoO$_3$. The sheet carrier density at the interface\ndecreases exponentially with $\\delta$-doping thickness. We have explored that\nthe spin-orbit scattering time ($\\tau_{so}$) can be decreased by nearly 3\norders of magnitude, whereas the inelastic scattering time ($\\tau_{i}$) remains\nalmost constant with $\\delta$-doping thickness. We have also observed that the\n$\\tau_{i}$ varies almost inversely proportional to temperature and $\\tau_{so}$\nremains insensitive to temperature, which suggest that the spin relaxation in\nthese interfaces follows D'yakonov-Perel mechanism. The observed in-plane\nanisotropic magnetoresistance is attributed to the mixing of the spin up and\nspin down states of d-band at Fermi level due to SOI.\n", "  Hashmi et al. [J. Phys. A 49, 345302 (2016)] claimed that the approach to the\npast of a quantum particle introduced by Vaidman [Phys. Rev. A 87, 052104\n(2013)] has difficulties in certain examples and that it even can be refuted.\nHere I reply to their criticism showing that the approach provides a good\nexplanation of all examples they considered. It is fully consistent with\nstandard quantum mechanics and provides a useful tool for analyzing\ninterference experiments.\n", "  Emergency of superconductivity at the instabilities of antiferromagnetism has\nbeen widely recognized in unconventional superconductors. In copper-oxide\nsuperconductors, spin fluctuations play a predominant role in electron pairing\nwith electron dopants yet composite orders veil the nature of superconductivity\nfor hole-doped family. However, in electron-doped copper oxide superconductors\n(cuprates) the AFM critical end point is still in controversy for different\nprobes, demonstrating high sensitivity to oxygen content. Here, by carefully\ntuning the oxygen content, a systematic study of the Hall signal and\nmagnetoresistivity up to 58 Tesla on LCCO thin films identifies two\ncharacteristic temperatures. The former is quite robust, whereas the latter\nbecomes flexible with increasing magnetic field, thereby linking respectively\nto two- and three-dimensional AFM, evident from the multidimensional phase\ndiagram as a function of oxygen and Ce dopants. A rigorous theoretical analysis\nof the presented data suggest the existence of conductive nano-filamentary\nstructures that effectively corroborate all previously reported field studies.\nThe new findings provide a uniquely consistent alternative picture in\nunderstanding the interactions between AFM and superconductivity in\nelectron-doped cuprates and offer a consolidating interpretation to the\npioneering scaling law in cuprates recently established by Bozovic et al.\n(Nature, 2016)\n", "  An extension with next-to-nearest neighbour interactions of the simplest XX\nspin chain with perfect state transfer (PST) is presented. The conditions for\nPST and entanglement generation (balanced fractional revival) can be obtained\nexactly and are discussed.\n", "  We here analyze the propagation of transients of fluid-rock temperature and\npressure through a thin boundary layer, where a steady trend is present,\nbetween two adjacent homogeneous rocks. We focus on the effect of convection on\ntransients crossing such thin layer. In comparison with early models where this\nboundary was assumed a sharp mathematical plane separating the two rocks, here\nwe show a realistic analysis of such boundary layer that implies a novel\nnonlinear model. Its solutions describe large amplitude, quick and sharp\ntransients characterized by a novel drift and variations of the signal\namplitude, leading to a nonlinear wave propagation. Possible applications are\nin volcanic, hydrologic, hydrothermal systems as well as for deep oil drilling.\nIn addition, this formalism could easily be generalized for the case of a\nsignal arriving in a rock characterized by a steady trend of pressure and/or\ntemperature. These effects, being proportional to the initial conditions, can\nalso give velocity variations not particularly important. A further heuristic\nmodel has therefore been analyzed, i.e. assuming a pressure dependent rock\npermeability. In this way, a remarkable increase of the system velocities is\nobtained.\n", "  We consider the problem of selecting a minimum size subset of nodes in a\nnetwork, that allows to activate all the nodes of the network. We present a\nfast and simple algorithm that, in real-life networks, produces solutions that\noutperform the ones obtained by using the best algorithms in the literature. We\nalso investigate the theoretical performances of our algorithm and give proofs\nof optimality for some classes of graphs. From an experimental perspective,\nexperiments also show that the performance of the algorithms correlates with\nthe modularity of the analyzed network. Moreover, the more the influence among\ncommunities is hard to propagate, the less the performances of the algorithms\ndiffer. On the other hand, when the network allows some propagation of\ninfluence between different communities, the gap between the solutions returned\nby the proposed algorithm and by the previous algorithms in the literature\nincreases.\n", "  Upon introduction into a biological system, engineered nanomaterials (ENMs)\nrapidly associate with a variety of biomolecules such as proteins and lipids to\nform a biocorona. The presence of biocorona influences nano-bio interactions\nconsiderably, and could ultimately result in altered biological responses.\nApolipoprotein A-I (ApoA-I), the major constituent of high-density lipoprotein\n(HDL), is one of the most prevalent proteins found in ENM-biocorona\nirrespective of ENM nature, size, and shape. Given the importance of ApoA-I in\nHDL and cholesterol transport, it is necessary to understand the mechanisms of\nApoA-I adsorption and the associated structural changes for assessing\nconsequences of ENM exposure. Here, we used a comprehensive array of\nmicroscopic and spectroscopic tools to elucidate the interactions between\nApoA-I and 100 nm Ag nanoparticles (AgNPs) with four different surface\nfunctional groups. We found that the protein adsorption and secondary\nstructural changes are highly dependent on the surface functionality. Our\nelectrochemical studies provided new evidence for charge transfer interactions\nthat influence ApoA-I unfolding. While the unfolding of ApoA-I on AgNPs did not\nsignificantly modify their cellular uptake and short-term cytotoxicity, we\nobserved that it strongly altered the ability of only some AgNPs to generate\nreactive oxygen species in macrophages. Our results shed new light on the\nimportance of surface functionality and charge transfer interactions in\nbiocorona formation.\n", "  We report on the experimental investigation of the polarization-dependent\nenergy splitting in the lower exciton-polariton branches of a 1D microcavity.\nThe splitting observed for the lowest branch can reach up to 1 meV. It does not\nresult from low temperature thermal constraints but from anisotropic mechanical\ninternal strains induced by etching. Those strains remove the degeneracy both\nin the photonic ($\\delta E_{\\mathrm{ph}}$) and excitonic ($\\delta\nE_{\\mathrm{exc}}$) components of the polariton but also in the photon-exciton\ncoupling ($\\delta\\Omega$). Those three contributions are accurately infered\nfrom experimental data. It appears that the sign and magnitude of the\npolarization splitting as well as the linear polarization of the corresponding\npolariton eigenstates can be tuned through the bare exciton-photon detuning.\nMoreover, no dependence on the width of the wire (from 3 to 7 $\\mathrm{\\mu}$m)\nis observed. We propose a mechanical model explaining the universality of those\nobservations paving the way to the engineering of polarization eigenstates in\nmicrowires exciton-polaritons.\n", "  We find a series of topological phase transitions in a\nhalf-metal/superconductor heterostructure, by tuning the direction of the\nmagnetization of the half-metal film. These include transitions between a\ntopological superconducting phase with a bulk gap and another phase without a\nbulk gap but has a ubiquitous local gap. At the same time, the edge states\nchange from counter-propagating Majorana edge modes to unidirectional Majorana\nedge modes. In addition, we find transitions between the second phase and a\nnodal phase which turns out to be a two-dimensional Weyl superconductor with\nFermi line edge states. We identify the topological invariants relevant to each\nphase and the symmetry that protects the Weyl superconductivity phase.\n", "  We report here a new concept, the use of bipolar electrochemistry, which\nallows the rapid and wireless growth of self-assembled TiO2 NT layers that\nconsist of highly defined and controllable gradients in NT length and diameter.\nThe gradient height and slope can be easily tailored with the time of\nelectrolysis and the applied electric field, respectively. As this technique\nallows obtaining in one run a wide range of self-ordered TiO2 NT dimensions, it\nprovides the basis for rapid screening of TiO2 NT properties. In two examples,\nwe show how these gradient arrays can be used to screen for an optimized\nphotocurrent response from TiO2 NT based devices such as dye-sensitized solar\ncells.\n", "  We describe a rapid screening technique for determining the optimal\ncharacteristics of nano- photocatalysts for the production of H2 on a single\nsurface. Arrays of TiO2 nanotubes (NTs) with a gradient in length and diameter\nwere fabricated by bipolar anodization and a perpendicular gradient of Pt\nnanoparticles (NPs) was generated by the toposelective decoration of the TiO2\nNTs. Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution was locally triggered with a UV laser\nbeam and the arrays were screened in x- and y-direction for spatially resolved\nkinetic measurements and the mapping of the optimal hydrogen production. By\nusing this technique, we demonstrate the time-efficient and straightforward\ndetermination of the tube dimensions and the Pt amount for an optimized H2\nproduction. The concept holds promise to generally improve the study of many\nphotoreactions as a function of the physicochemical characteristic of\nnano-photocatalysts, which renders it highly attractive for the optimization of\nvarious important chemical processes.\n", "  We report the synthesis and characterization of a novel class of ionic\nsemiconductor materials- inorganic chalcogenide perovskites. Several different\ncompounds including BaZrS3, CaZrS3, SrTiS3 and SrZrS3 were synthesized by high\ntemperature sulfurization of their oxide counterparts. Their crystal structures\nwere identified by XRD and composition by EDX. UV-vis and photoluminescence\nmeasurements confirmed that they are direct gap semiconductors with band gap\nvalues consistent with theoretical predictions. By adopting an anion alloying\napproach, we demonstrate widely tunable band gap from 1.73 eV to 2.87 eV. These\nstrongly ionic semiconductors provide a new avenue for engineering the\nsemiconducting properties for applications such as energy harvesting, solid\nstate lighting and sensing.\n", "  In the present work we compare TiO2 nanotube lift-off strategies for the\nconstruction of front-side illuminated dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs).\nAnodic nanotube layers were detached from the metallic back contact by using\ndifferent techniques and transferred onto an FTO substrate. We show that if we\nuse an optimized potential step treatment to fabricate membranes, DSSC cell\nefficiencies can be significantly increased (>8%). This improved efficiency is\nascribed to higher specific dye-loading and enhanced electron transport\nproperties of optimally fabricated TiO2 nanotube membranes.\n", "  In the present work we investigate various optical properties (such as light\nabsorption and reflectance) of anodic TiO2 nanotubes layers directly\ntransferred as self-standing membranes onto quartz substrates. This allows\ninvestigation in a transmission geometry which provides significantly more\nreliable data than measurements on the metallic Ti substrate. Light\ntransmission and reflectance measurements were carried out for layers of\nthicknesses varying from 1.8 to 50 micrometer, and the layers were investigated\nin their amorphous and crystalline form. A series of wavelength-dependent light\nattenuation coefficients are extrapolated and found to match the photocurrent\nvs. irradiation wavelength behavior. However, a feature specific to anodic\nnanotubes is that their intrinsic carbon content causes a sub-bandgap response\nthat is proportional to the carbon contamination content in the TiO2 nanotubes.\nOverall the extracted data provide valuable basis and understanding for the\ndesign of photo-electrochemical devices based on TiO2 nanotubes.\n", "  This is the unedited authors' version of Chapter 3 appearing in the following\nbook: Self-Assembly Systems: Theory and Simulations Ed. Li-Tang Yan John Wiley\n& Sons, Ltd, Chichester, pp. 53-84 (2017)\n", "  We present 16 new, and confirm 7 previously identified, DA white dwarfs in\nthe Kepler field through ground-based spectroscopy with the Hale 200\", Kitt\nPeak 4-meter, and Bok 2.3-meter telescopes. Using atmospheric models we\ndetermine their effective temperatures and surface gravities to constrain their\nposition with respect to the ZZ Ceti (DA pulsator) instability strip, and look\nfor the presence or absence of pulsation with Kepler's unprecedented\nphotometry. Our results are as follows: i) From our measurements of temperature\nand surface gravity, 12 of the 23 DA white dwarfs from this work fall well\noutside of the instability strip. The Kepler photometry available for 11 of\nthese WDs allows us to confirm that none are pulsating. One of these eleven\nhappens to be a presumed binary, KIC 11604781, with a period of ~5 days. ii)\nThe remaining 11 DA white dwarfs are instability strip candidates, potentially\nfalling within the current, empirical instability strip, after accounting for\nuncertainties. These WDs will help constrain the strip's location further, as\neight are near the blue edge and three are near the red edge of the instability\nstrip. Four of these WDs do not have Kepler photometry, so ground-based\nphotometry is needed to determine the pulsation nature of these white dwarfs.\nThe remaining seven have Kepler photometry available, but do not show any\nperiodicity on typical WD pulsation timescales.\n", "  We introduce a new type of synthetic saturable absorbers based on quantum\ninspired photonic arrays whose linear light transport characteristics can be\nderived via bosonic algebra. We demonstrate that the interplay between optical\nKerr nonlinearity, interference effects and non-Hermiticity through radiation\nloss leads to a nonlinear optical filtering response with two distinct regimes\nof small and large optical transmissions. More interestingly, we show that the\nboundary between these two regimes can be very sharp. The threshold optical\nintensity that marks this abrupt \"phase transition\" and its steepness can be\nengineered by varying the number of the guiding elements. The practical\nfeasibility of these structures as well as their potential applications in\nlaser systems and optical signal processing are also discussed.\n", "  We give an upper bound for the uniqueness transition on an arbitrary locally\nfinite graph ${\\cal G}$ in terms of the limit of the spectral radii $\\rho\\left[\nH({\\cal G}_t)\\right]$ of the non-backtracking (Hashimoto) matrices for an\nincreasing sequence of subgraphs ${\\cal G}_t\\subset{\\cal G}_{t+1}$ which\nconverge to ${\\cal G}$. With the added assumption of strong local connectivity\nfor the oriented line graph (OLG) of ${\\cal G}$, connectivity on any finite\nsubgraph ${\\cal G}'\\subset{\\cal G}$ decays exponentially for $p<(\\rho\\left[\nH({\\cal G}^{\\prime})\\right])^{-1}$.\n", "  An exact analytical solution for the Bohr Hamiltonian with an energy\ndependent Coulomb-like $\\gamma$-unstable potential is presented. Due to the\nlinear energy dependence of the potential's coupling constant, the\ncorresponding spectrum in the asymptotic limit of the slope parameter resembles\nthe spectral structure of the spherical vibrator, however with a different\nstate degeneracy. The parameter free energy spectrum as well as the transition\nrates for this case are given in closed form and duly compared with those of\nthe harmonic $U(5)$ dynamical symmetry. The model wave functions are found to\nexhibit properties that can be associated to shape coexistence. A possible\nexperimental realization of the model is found in few medium nuclei with a very\nlow second $0^{+}$ state known to exhibit competing prolate, oblate and\nspherical shapes.\n", "  The LHCb experiment is designed to study the decays and properties of heavy\nflavoured hadrons produced in the forward region from proton-proton collisions\nat the CERN Large Hadron Collider. During Run 1, it has recorded the world's\nlargest data sample of beauty and charm hadrons, enabling precise studies into\nthe spectroscopy of such particles, including discoveries of new states and\nmeasurements of their masses, widths and quantum numbers. An overview of recent\nLHCb results in the area of exotic hadron spectroscopy is presented, focussing\non the discovery of the first pentaquark states in the $\\Lambda_b^0 \\to J/\\psi\np K^-$ channel and a search for them in the related $\\Lambda_b^0 \\to J/\\psi\np\\pi^-$ mode. The LHCb non-confirmation of the D0 tetraquark candidate in the\n$B_s^0\\pi^+$ invariant mass spectrum is presented.\n", "  The large transparency window of silicon, covering the 1.1 um 8 um wavelength\nrange, makes it a promising platform for the implementation of\nphotothermal-based absorption spectrometers. These devices indirectly sense\nabsorption in the mid-infrared (MIR) by using near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths,\nthereby enabling the realization of MIR absorption spectrometers without the\nneed for MIR photodetectors. Nevertheless, due to their comparatively large\nindex contrast and cross-sections, MIR Si strip waveguides are multi-mode at\nNIR wavelengths, hindering device implementation. Here we present, for the\nfirst time, an integrated Bragg grating waveguide filter for hybrid near- and\nmid-infrared operation. Specifically, the filter is implemented in a\nsingle-etch suspended silicon corrugated waveguide with an effectively\nsingle-mode operation in NIR region for a waveguide cross-section as large as\n0.5 um x 1.1 um. At the same time, the waveguide supports single-mode\npropagation in MIR region. We demonstrate a long-period waveguide Bragg grating\nyielding a sharp third-order Bragg resonance for the fundamental waveguide mode\nand radiating the higher order modes. We experimentally demonstrate a notch\nfilter with a 4nm bandwidth and 40 dB extinction ratio with a\ntemperature-dependent Bragg wavelength shift of 70pm/K.\n", "  The goals, current status, and preliminary results of the VLBA Calibration\nSurvey VCS-9 are discussed.\n", "  We study a microscopic derivation and the properties of the\nDzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) between local magnetic moments in\nferromagnet/heavy metal heterostructures. First, we derive DMI by\nRuderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida interaction through electrons in a heavy metal\nwith Rashba spin orbit interaction (SOI). Next, we study the dependences of the\nDMI on the Rashba SOI, lattice constant, and chemical potential. We find that\nthe DMI amplitude increases linearly when the Rashba SOI is small, has a\nmaximum when the Rashba SOI is comparable to the hopping integral, and\ndecreases when the Rashba SOI is large. The sign of the DMI not only changes\ndepending on the sign of the Rashba SOI but also the lattice constants and the\nchemical potential of the heavy metal. The implications of the obtained results\nfor experiments are discussed.\n", "  Using angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) we report the first\nband dispersions and distinct features of the bulk Fermi surface (FS) in the\nparamagnetic metallic phase of the prototypical metal-insulator transition\nmaterial V$_2$O$_3$. Along the $c$-axis we observe both an electron pocket and\na triangular hole-like FS topology, showing that both V 3$d$ $a_{1g}$ and\n$e_g^{\\pi}$ states contribute to the FS. These results challenge the existing\ncorrelation-enhanced crystal field splitting theoretical explanation for the\ntransition mechanism and pave the way for the solution of this mystery.\n", "  The anomalous Hall effect is investigated for ferromagnetic Fe3Sn2 single\ncrystal with geometrically frustrated kagome bilayer of Fe. The scaling\nbehavior between anomalous Hall resistivity rho_{xy}^{A} and longitudinal\nresistivity rho_{xx} is quadratic and further analysis implies that the AHE in\nFe3Sn2 single crystal should be dominated by the intrinsic Karplus-Luttinger\nmechanism rather than extrinsic skew-scattering or side-jump mechanisms.\nMoreover, there is a sudden jump of anomalous Hall conductivity sigma_{xy}^{A}\nappearing at about 100 K where the spin-reorientation transition from the c\naxis to the ab plane is completed. This change of sigma_{xy}^{A} might be\nrelated to the evolution of Fermi surface induced by the spin-reorientation\ntransition.\n", "  In this paper, we study the OZI-allowed two-body strong decays of $3^-$\nheavy-light mesons. Experimentally the charmed $D_{3}^{\\ast}(2760)$ and the\ncharm-strange $D_{s3}^{\\ast}(2860)$ states with these quantum numbers have been\ndiscovered. For the bottomed $B(5970)$ state, which was found by the CDF\nCollaboration recently, its quantum number has not been decided yet and we\nassume its a $3^-$ meson in this paper. The theoretical prediction for the\nstrong decays of bottom-strange state $B_{s3}^\\ast$ is also given. The\nrelativistic wave functions of $3^-$ heavy mesons are constructed and their\nnumerical values are obtained by solving the corresponding Bethe-Salpeter\nequation with instantaneous approximation. The transition matrix is calculated\nby using the PCAC and low energy theorem, following which, the decay widths are\nobtained. For $D_{3}^\\ast(2760)$ and $D_{s3}^\\ast(2860)$, the total strong\ndecay widths are 72.6 MeV and 47.6 MeV, respectively. For $B_3^\\ast$ with\n$M=5978$ MeV and $B_{s3}^\\ast$ with $M=6178$ MeV, their strong decay widths are\n22.9 MeV and 40.8 MeV, respectively.\n", "  B[e] supergiants (B[e]SGs) are emission-line objects, presumably in a\nshort-lived phase in the post-main sequence evolution of massive stars. Their\nintense infrared excess emission indicates large amounts of warm circumstellar\ndust, and the stars were longtime assumed to possess an aspherical wind\nconsisting of a classical line-driven wind in polar direction and a dense, slow\nequatorial wind dubbed outflowing disk. The general properties obtained for\nthese disks are in line with this scenario, although current theories have\nconsiderable difficulties reproducing the observed quantities. Therefore, more\nsophisticated observational constraints are needed. These follow from combined\noptical and infrared spectroscopic studies, which delivered the surprising\nresult that the circumstellar material of B[e]SGs is concentrated in multiple\nrings revolving the stars on stable Keplerian orbits. Such a scenario requires\nnew ideas for the formation mechanism, in which pulsations might play an\nimportant role.\n", "  Almost 20% of the ~ 200 different species detected in the interstellar and\ncircumstellar media present a carbon atom linked to nitrogen by a triple bond.\nAmong these 37 molecules, 30 are nitrile R-CN compounds, the remaining seven\nbelonging to the isonitrile R-NC family. How these species behave in presence\nof the grain surfaces is still an open question. In this contribution we\ninvestigate whether the difference between nitrile and isonitrile functional\ngroups may induce differences in the adsorption energies of the related isomers\nat the surfaces of interstellar grains of different nature and morphologies.\nThe question was addressed by means of a concerted experimental and theoretical\nstudy of the adsorption energies of CH3CN and CH3NC on the surface water ice\nand silica. The experimental determination of the molecule - surface\ninteraction energies was carried out using temperature programmed desorption\n(TPD) under an ultra-high vacuum (UHV) between 70 and 160 K. Theoretically, the\nquestion was addressed using first principle periodic density functional theory\n(DFT) to represent the organized solid support. The most stable isomer (CH3CN)\ninteracts more efficiently with the solid support than the higher energy isomer\n(CH3NC) for water ice and silica. Comparing with the HCN and HNC pair of\nisomers, the simulations show an opposite behaviour, in which isonitrile HNC\nare more strongly adsorbed than nitrile HCN provided that hydrogen bonds are\ncompatible with the nature of the model surface. The present study confirms\nthat the strength of the molecule surface interaction between isomers is not\nrelated to their intrinsic stability but instead to their respective ability to\ngenerate different types of hydrogen bonds.\n", "  In this second research note of a series of two, we present the first\nnear-infrared results we obtained when modeling Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN).\nOur first proceedings showed the comparison between the MontAGN and STOKES\nMonte Carlo codes. Now we use our radiative transfer codes to simulate the\npolarization maps of a prototypical, NGC 1068-like, type-2 radio-quiet AGN. We\nproduced high angular resolution infrared (1 micron) polarization images to be\ncompared with recent observations in this wavelength range. Our preliminary\nresults already show a good agreement between the models and observations but\ncannot account for the peculiar linear polarization angle of the torus such as\nobserved. Gratadour et al. 2015 found a polarization position angle being\nperpendicular to the bipolar outflows axis. Further work is needed to improve\nthe models by adding physical phenomena such as dichroism and clumpiness.\n", "  We present a general scenario for high-temperature superconducting cuprates,\nbased on the presence of dynamical charge density waves (CDWs) and to the\noccurrence of a CDW quantum critical point, which occurs, e.g., at doping\np~0.16 in YBCO. In this framework, even the pseudogap temperature T* is\ninterpreted in terms of a reduction of the density of states due to incipient\nCDW and, at lower temperature to the possible formation of incoherent\nsuperconducting pairs. The dynamically fluctuating character of CDW accounts\nfor the different temperatures at which the pseudogap (T*), the CDW onset\nrevealed by X-ray scattering (T_{ons}(p)), and the static three-dimensional CDW\nordering appear. We also investigate the anisotropic character of the\nCDW-mediated scattering. We find that this is strongly anisotropic only close\nto the CDW quantum critical point (QCP) at low temperature and very low energy.\nIt rapidly becomes nearly isotropic and marginal-Fermi-liquid-like away from\nthe CDW QCP and at finite (even rather small) energies. This may reconcile the\ninterpretation of Hall measurements in terms of anisotropic CDW scattering with\nrecent photoemission experiments.\n", "  We present a minimal model for particle physics and cosmology. The Standard\nModel (SM) particle content is extended by three right-handed SM-singlet\nneutrinos N_i and a vector-like quark Q, all of them being charged under a\nglobal lepton number and Peccei-Quinn (PQ) U(1) symmetry which is spontaneously\nbroken by the vacuum expectation value v_sigma around 10^{11} GeV of a\nSM-singlet complex scalar field sigma. Five fundamental problems -- neutrino\noscillations, baryogenesis, dark matter, inflation, strong CP problem -- are\nsolved at one stroke in this model, dubbed \"SM*A*S*H\" (Standard\nModel*Axion*Seesaw*Higgs portal inflation). It can be probed decisively by\nupcoming cosmic microwave background and axion dark matter experiments.\n", "  We optimize the deposition of CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite into mesoporous\nelectrodes consisting of anodic TiO2 nanotube layers. By a simple spin coating\napproach, complete filling of the tube scaffolds is obtained, that leads to\ninterdigitated perovskite structures in conformal contact with the TiO2 tube\ncounterparts. Such assemblies can be used as solid state solar cells in\nhole-transporting material-free configuration, i.e., the tube scaffold serves\nas electron collector and blocking layer, while the perovskite acts as visible\nlight absorber and hole transporting material. We show that the complete\nfilling of the tube scaffold with the perovskite is essential to improve the\nsolar cell efficiency.\n", "  The large amount of work on community detection and its applications leaves\nunaddressed one important question: the statistical validation of the results.\nIn this paper we present a methodology able to clearly detect if the community\nstructure found by some algorithms is statistically significant or is a result\nof chance, merely due to edge positions in the network. Given a community\ndetection method and a network of interest, our proposal examines the stability\nof the partition recovered against random perturbations of the original graph\nstructure. To address this issue, we specify a perturbation strategy and a null\nmodel to build a set of procedures based on a special measure of clustering\ndistance, namely Variation of Information, using tools set up for functional\ndata analysis. The procedures determine whether the obtained clustering departs\nsignificantly from the null model. This strongly supports the robustness\nagainst perturbation of the algorithm used to identify the community structure.\nWe show the results obtained with the proposed technique on simulated and real\ndatasets.\n", "  Context. The Annular Groove Phase Mask (AGPM) is one possible implementation\nof the vector vortex coronagraph, where the helical phase ramp is produced by a\nconcentric subwavelength grating. For several years, we have been manufacturing\nAGPMs by etching gratings into synthetic diamond substrates using inductively\ncoupled plasma etching. Aims. We aim to design, fabricate, optimize, and\nevaluate new L-band AGPMs that reach the highest possible coronagraphic\nperformance, for applications in current and forthcoming infrared high-contrast\nimagers. Methods. Rigorous coupled wave analysis (RCWA) is used for designing\nthe subwavelength grating of the phase mask. Coronagraphic performance\nevaluation is performed on a dedicated optical test bench. The experimental\nresults of the performance evaluation are then used to accurately determine the\nactual profile of the fabricated gratings, based on RCWA modeling. Results. The\nAGPM coronagraphic performance is very sensitive to small errors in etch depth\nand grating profile. Most of the fabricated components therefore show moderate\nperformance in terms of starlight rejection (a few 100:1 in the best cases).\nHere we present new processes for re-etching the fabricated components in order\nto optimize the parameters of the grating and hence significantly increase\ntheir coronagraphic performance. Starlight rejection up to 1000:1 is\ndemonstrated in a broadband L filter on the coronagraphic test bench, which\ncorresponds to a raw contrast of about 1e-5 at two resolution elements from the\nstar for a perfect input wave front on a circular, unobstructed aperture.\nConclusions. Thanks to their exquisite performance, our latest L-band AGPMs are\ngood candidates for installation in state-of-the-art and future high-contrast\nthermal infrared imagers, such as METIS for the E-ELT.\n", "  Population dynamics is constrained by the environment, which needs to obey\ncertain conditions to support population growth. We consider a standard model\nfor the evolution of a single species population density, that includes\nreproduction, competition for resources and spatial spreading, while subject to\nan external harmful effect. The habitat is spatially heterogeneous, there\nexisting a refuge where the population can be protected. Temporal variability\nis introduced by the intermittent character of the refuge. This scenario can\napply to a wide range of situations, from a lab setting where bacteria can be\nprotected by a blinking mask from ultraviolet radiation, to large scale\necosystems, like a marine reserve where there can be seasonal fishing\nprohibitions. Using analytical and numerical tools, we investigate the\nasymptotic behavior of the total population as a function of the size and\ncharacteristic time scales of the refuge. We obtain expressions for the minimal\nsize required for population survival, in the slow and fast time scale limits.\n", "  Shale gas recovery has seen a major boom in recent years due to the\nincreasing global energy demands; but the extraction technologies are very\nexpensive. It is therefore important to develop realistic transport modelling\nand simulation methods, for porous rocks and porous media, that can compliment\nthe field work. Here, a new nonlinear transport model for single phase gas flow\nin tight porous media is derived, incorporating many important physical\nprocesses that occur in such porous systems: continuous flow, transition flow,\nslip flow, Knudsen diffusion, adsorption and desorption in to and out of the\nrock material, and a correction for high flow rates (turbulence). This produces\na nonlinear advection-diffusion type of partial differential equation (PDE)\nwith pressure dependent model parameters and associated compressibility\ncoefficients, and highly nonlinear apparent convective flux (velocity) and\napparent diffusivity. An important application is to the determination of shale\nrock properties, such as porosity and permeability, by history matching of the\nthe simulation results to data from pressure-pulse decay tests in a shale rock\ncore sample [Pong K., Ho C., Liu J., Tai Y. Non-linear pressure distribution in\nuniform microchannels. ASME Fluids Eng. Div. (FED) Vol. 197, 51--56, (1994)].\nThe estimates of the rock porosity and the permeability from our model\nsimulations are realistic of shale rocks, more realistic than obtained from\nprevious models, and illustrates the potential of the modelling strategy\npresented here in producing accurate simulations of shale gas flow in tight\nreservoirs.\n", "  We introduce the use of pure molten ortho-phosphoric acid (o-H3PO4) as an\nelectrolyte for selforganizing electrochemistry. This electrolyte allows for\nthe formation of self-organized oxide architectures (one-dimensional nanotubes,\nnanochannels, nanopores) on metals such as tungsten that up to now were\nregarded as very difficult to grow self-ordered anodic oxide structures. In\nthis work, we show particularly the fabrication of thick, vertically aligned\ntungsten oxide nanochannel layers, with pore diameter of ca. 10 nm, and\nillustrate their potential use in some typical applications.\n", "  We discuss charm $D^0 D^0$ meson-meson pair production in the forward\nrapidity region related to the LHCb experimental studies at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 7 TeV.\nWe consider double-parton scattering mechanisms of double $c \\bar c$ production\nand subsequent standard $cc \\to D^{0}D^{0}$ scale-independent hadronization as\nwell as new double $g$ and mixed $g c\\bar c $ production mechanisms with $gg\n\\to D^{0}D^{0}$ and $gc \\to D^{0}D^{0}$ scale-dependent hadronization. The new\nscenario with gluon fragmentation components results also in a new\nsingle-parton scattering mechanism of $gg$ production which is also taken here\ninto account. Results of the numerical calculations are compared with the LHCb\ndata for several correlation observables. The new mechanisms lead to a larger\ncross sections and to slightly different shapes of the calculated correlation\nobservables.\n", "  We study the classical dynamics of a binary stars when there is an\ninterchange of mass between them. Assuming that one of the star is more massive\nthan the other, the dynamics of the lighter one is analyzed as a function of\nits time depending mass variation. Within our approximations and models for\nmass transference, we obtain a general result which establishes that if the\nlightest star looses mass, its period increases. If the lightest star win mass,\nits period decreases.\n", "  In this paper, an ElectroMagnetic-Power-based Characteristic Mode Theory\n(CMT) for PEC systems (PEC-EMP-CMT) is built. The PEC-EMP-CMT is valid for the\nPEC systems which are surrounded by any electromagnetic environment, and it can\nconstruct the complex characteristic currents and non-radiative Characteristic\nModes (CMs). In this paper, some traditional concepts, such as the system input\nimpedance and modal input impedance etc., are redefined; the traditional\ncharacteristic quantity, Modal Significance (MS), is generalized; a series of\nnew power-based CM sets are introduced. It is proven in this paper that various\npower-based CM sets of a certain objective PEC structure are independent of the\nexternal environment and excitation; the non-radiative space constituted by all\nnon-radiative modes is identical to the interior resonance space constituted by\nall interior resonant modes of closed PEC structures, and the non-radiative CMs\nconstitute a basis of the space. Based on above these, the normal Eigen-Mode\nTheory (EMT) for closed PEC structures is classified into the PEC-EMP-CMT\nframework. In addition, a variational formulation for the external scattering\nproblem of PEC structures is provided in this paper, based on the conservation\nlaw of energy.\n", "  We discuss the single-parton and double-parton scattering (SPS or DPS)\neffects in four-jet production at the LHC. The calculations of both\nsingle-parton and double-parton scattering components are done in the\nhigh-energy (or $k_{T}$)-factorization approach. Here we follow our recent\ndevelopments of relevant methods and tools. The calculations are performed for\nkinematical situations relevant for two experimental measurements (ATLAS and\nCMS) at the LHC. We compare our results to those reported by the ATLAS and CMS\ncollaborations for different sets of kinematical cuts. A special attention is\ngiven to the optimization of kinematical conditions in order to enhance the\nrelative contribution of DPS in four-jet sample. Several differential\ndistributions are calculated and carefully discussed in the context of recent\nand future searches for DPS effects at the LHC. The dependences of the relative\nDPS amount is studied as a function of rapidity of jets, rapidity distance, and\nvarious azimuthal correlations between jets. The regions with an enhanced DPS\ncontribution are identified.\n", "  We report on composition controlled MoS$_{2}$ and MoO$_{x}$ (x=2 and 3)\ncompounds electrodeposited on Flourine dopped Tin Oxide (FTO) substrate. It was\nobserved that the relative content has systematic electrical and optical\nchanges for different thicknesses of layers ranging from $\\approx$20 to 540 nm.\nOptical and electrical bandgaps reveals a tuneable behavior by controlling the\nrelative content of compounds as well as a sharp transition from p to n-type of\nsemiconductivity. Moreover, spin-orbit interaction of Mo 3d doublet enhances by\nreduction of MoO$_{3}$ content in thicker films. Our results convey path-way of\napplying such compounds in optoelectronics and nanoelectronics devices.\n", "  We study the evolution of the hybrid entangled squeezed states of the\nqubit-oscillator system in the strong coupling domain. Following the adiabatic\napproximation we obtain the reduced density matrices of the qubit and the\noscillator degrees of freedom. The oscillator reduced density matrix is\nutilized to calculate the quasiprobability distributions such as the\nSudarshan-Glauber diagonal P -representation, the Wigner W -distribution, and\nthe nonnegative Husimi Q-function. The negativity associated with the W\n-distribution acts as a measure of the nonclassicality of the state. The\nexistence of the multiple time scales induced by the interaction introduces\ncertain features in the bipartite system. In the strong coupling regime the\ntransient evolution to low entropy configurations reveals brief emergence of\nnearly pure kitten states that may be regarded as superposition of uniformly\nseparated distinguishable squeezed coherent states. However, the quantum\nfluctuations with a short time period engender bifurcation and subsequent\nrejoining of these peaks in the phase space. The abovementioned doubling of the\nnumber of peaks increases the entropy to its near maximal value. Nonetheless,\nthese states characterized by high entropy values, are endowed with a large\nnegativity of the W -distribution that points towards their non-Gaussian\nbehavior. This may be ascertained by the significantly large Hilbert-Schmidt\ndistance between the oscillator state and an ensemble of most general\nstatistical mixture of squeezed Gaussian states possessing nearly identical\nsecond order quadrature moments as that of the oscillator.\n", "  We fabricate photo-anodes by transferring anodic TiO2 nanotube membranes in\ntube-top-down configuration on FTO glass, and use them for constructing\nfrontside illuminated dye-sensitized solar cells. Prior to solar cell\nconstruction, the tube-based photo-anodes are crystallized at different\ntemperatures (400-800{\\deg}C), and the effects of tube electron transport\nproperties on the photovoltaic performance of the solar cells are investigated.\nWe show that improved solar cell efficiencies (up to ca. 8.0%) can be reached\nby high-temperature treatment of the tube membranes. Consistently with electron\ntransport time measurements, remarkably enhanced electron mobility is enabled\nwhen tube membranes are crystallized at 600{\\deg}C.\n", "  We discuss the Drell-Yan production of dileptons at high energies in the\nforward rapidity region of proton-proton collisions in a hybrid high-energy\napproach. This approach uses unintegrated gluon distributions in one proton and\ncollinear quark/antiquark distributions in the second proton.\n  We compute various distributions for the case of low-mass dilepton production\nand compare to the LHCb and ATLAS experimental data on dilepton mass\ndistributions. In distinction to dipole approaches, we include four Drell-Yan\nstructure functions as well as cuts at the level of lepton kinematics. The\nimpact of the interference structure functions is rather small for typical\nexperimental cuts. We find that both side contributions ($g q/\\bar q$ and\n$q/\\bar q g$) have to be included even for the LHCb rapidity coverage which is\nin contradiction with what is usually done in the dipole approach. We present\nresults for different unintegrated gluon distributions from the literature.\nSome of them include saturation effects, but we see no clear hints of\nsaturation even at small $M_{ll}$.\n", "  With materials approaching the 2d limit yielding many exciting systems with\nintriguing physical properties and promising technological functionalities,\nunderstanding and engineering magnetic order in nanoscale, layered materials is\ngenerating keen interest. One such material is V$_{5}$S$_{8}$, a metal with an\nantiferromagnetic ground state below the N\\'eel temperature $T_{N} \\sim$ 32 K\nand a prominent spin-flop signature in the magnetoresistance (MR) when $H||c\n\\sim$ 4.2 T. Here we study nanoscale-thickness single crystals of\nV$_{5}$S$_{8}$, focusing on temperatures close to $T_{N}$ and the evolution of\nmaterial properties in response to systematic reduction in crystal thickness.\nTransport measurements just below $T_{N}$ reveal magnetic hysteresis that we\nascribe to a metamagnetic transition, the first-order magnetic field-driven\nbreakdown of the ordered state. The reduction of crystal thickness to $\\sim$ 10\nnm coincides with systematic changes in the magnetic response: $T_{N}$ falls,\nimplying that antiferromagnetism is suppressed; and while the spin-flop\nsignature remains, the hysteresis disappears, implying that the metamagnetic\ntransition becomes second order as the thickness approaches the 2d limit. This\nwork demonstrates that single crystals of magnetic materials with nanometer\nthicknesses are promising systems for future studies of magnetism in reduced\ndimensionality and quantum phase transitions.\n", "  By first-principles calculations, we find that Ba2X(X=Si, Ge) hosts a\ntopological semimetal phase with one nodal ring in the kx=0 plane, which is\nprotected by the glide mirror symmetry when spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is\nignored. The corresponding drumheadlike surface flat band appears on the (100)\nsurface in surface Green function calculation. Furthermore, a\ntopological-semimetal-to-insulator transition (TSMIT) is found. The nodal line\nsemimetal would evolve into topological insulator as SOC is turned on. The\ntopologically protected metallic surface states emerge around the Gamma=0\npoint, which could be tuned into topologically-trivial insulator state by more\nthan 3% hydrostatic strain. These results reveal a new category of materials\nshowing quantum phase transition between topological semimetal and insulator,\nand tunability through elastic strain engineering.\n", "  Gravitational forces are expected to excite spiral density waves in\nprotoplanetary disks, disks of gas and dust orbiting young stars. However,\nprevious observations that showed spiral structure were not able to probe disk\nmidplanes, where most of the mass is concentrated and where planet formation\ntakes place. Using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array we detected\na pair of trailing symmetric spiral arms in the protoplanetary disk surrounding\nthe young star Elias 2-27. The arms extend to the disk outer regions and can be\ntraced down to the midplane. These millimeter-wave observations also reveal an\nemission gap closer to the star than the spiral arms. We argue that the\nobserved spirals trace shocks of spiral density waves in the midplane of this\nyoung disk.\n", "  We suggest a specific semiclassical background field, the so called pure\ngauge sphaleron explosion, to evaluate the magnitude of the CP violation\nstemming from the standard phase of the CKM matrix. We use it to evaluate the\nmatrix elements of some next-to-leading order effective CP-violating operators\nsuggested in the literature. We also derive the scale dependence of the\ncorresponding coefficients. Finally, we discuss the expected magnitude of the\nCP violation in the cold electroweak scenario.\n", "  We describe a calibration setup for the transresistance of low-current\namplifiers, based on the capacitance-charging method. The calibration can be\nperformed in the current range of typical interest for electron counting\nexperiments. The setup implementation is simple and rugged, and is suitable to\nbe embedded in larger experiments where the amplifier is employed. The\ncalibration is traceable to units of capacitance and of time. The base relative\naccuracy of the implementation is in the 10^-5 range.\n", "  According to the standard paradigm, the strong and compact luminosity of\nactive galactic nuclei (AGN) is due to multi-temperature black body emission\noriginating from an accretion disk formed around a supermassive black hole.\nThis central engine is thought to be surrounded by a dusty region along the\nequatorial plane and by ionized winds along the poles. The innermost regions\ncannot yet be resolved neither in the optical nor in the infrared and it is\nfair to say that we still lack a satisfactory understanding of the physical\nprocesses, geometry and composition of the central (sub-parsec) components of\nAGN. Like spectral or polarimetric observations, the reverberation data needs\nto be modeled in order to infer constraints on the AGN geometry (such as the\ninner radius or the half-opening angle of the dusty torus). In this research\nnote, we present preliminary modeling results using a time-dependent Monte\nCarlo method to solve the radiative transfer in a simplified AGN set up. We\ninvestigate different model configurations using both polarization and time\nlags and find a high dependency on the geometry to the time-lag response. For\nall models there is a clear distinction between edge-on or face-on viewing\nangles for fluxes and time lags, the later showing a higher\nwavelength-dependence than the former. Time lags, polarization and fluxes point\ntoward a clear dichotomy between the different inclinations of AGN, a method\nthat could help us to determine the true orientation of the nucleus in Seyfert\ngalaxies.\n", "  List of contributions from the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) Consortium\npresented at the 6th International Symposium on High-Energy Gamma-Ray Astronomy\n(Gamma 2016), July 11-15, 2016, in Heidelberg, Germany.\n", "  TiO2 nanotube arrays grown by anodization were coated with thin layers of\npolydopamine as visible light sensitizer. The PDA-coated TiO2 scaffolds were\nused as photocatalyst for selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol under\nmonochromatic irradiation at 473 nm. Benzaldehyde was selectively formed and no\nby-products could be detected. A maximized reaction yield was obtained in\nO2-saturated acetonitrile. A mechanism is proposed that implies firstly the\ncharge carrier generation in polydopamine as a consequence of visible light\nabsorption. Secondly, photo-promoted electrons are injected in TiO2 conduction\nband, and subsequently transferred to dissolved O2 to form oxygen radical\nanions. These radicals react with benzyl alcohol and lead to its selective\ndehydrogenation oxidation towards benzaldehyde.\n", "  In the present work we introduce a technique to form a photocatalyst, based\non Pt nanoparticles suspended over the mouth of TiO2 nanotubes. These\nstructures are obtained by the decoration of the top end of highly ordered TiO2\nnanotubes with a web of TiO2 nanofibrils, followed by sputter deposition of a\nminimum amount of Pt. A subsequent thermal dewetting step forms 3-6 nm-sized Pt\nnanoparticles along the nanofibrils. These structures, when compared to\nconventional Pt decoration techniques of TiO2 nanotubes, show a strongly\nenhanced photocatalytic H2 evolution efficiency.\n", "  The least is the best. We introduce a technique to strongly reduce Pt use for\nphotocatalytic hydrogen generation from TiO2 nanotubes. By site-selectively\ndepositing thin layers of Pt only at the mouth of the nanotubes and by a\nsubsequent thermal dewetting step, we achieve an outstanding photocatalytic\nimprovement with minimal amounts of co-catalyst.\n", "  An extremely efficient ethanol fuel cell electrode is produced by combining\nthe large surface area of vertically oriented and highly conductive few-layer\ngraphene sheets with electrochemically deposited palladium nanoparticles. The\nelectrodes show an extraordinary high catalyst activity of up to 7977 mA/(mg\nPd) at low catalyst loadings of 0.64 $\\mu$g/cm$^2$ and a very high current\ndensity of up to 106 mA/cm$^2$ at high catalyst loadings of 83 $\\mu$g/cm$^2$.\nMoreover, the low onset potentials combined with a good poisoning resistance\nand long-term stability make these electrodes highly suitable for real\napplications. These features are achieved by using a newly developed\nelectrochemical catalyst deposition process exploiting high voltages of up to\n3.5 kV. This technique allows controlling the catalyst amount ranging from a\nhomogeneous widespread distribution of small ($\\leq$ 10 nm) palladium\nnanoparticles to rather dense layers of particles, while every catalyst\nparticle has electrical contact to the graphene electrode.\n", "  In this first research note of a series of two, we present a comparison\nbetween two Monte Carlo radiative transfer codes: MontAGN and STOKES. Both were\ndeveloped in order to better understand the observed polarisation of Active\nGalactic Nuclei (AGN). Our final aim is to use these radiative transfer codes\nto simulate the polarisation maps of a prototypical type-2 radio-quiet AGN on a\nwide range of wavelengths, from the infrared band with MontAGN to the X-ray\nenergies with STOKES. Doing so, we aim to analyse in depth the recent\nSPHERE/IRDIS polarimetric observations conducted on NGC 1068. In order to\nvalidate the codes and obtain preliminary results, we set for both codes a\ncommon and simple AGN model, and compared their polaro-imaging results.\n", "  In the present work we grow self-organized Ta2O5 nanotube layers in a\nH2SO4/NH4F electrolyte at various elevated temperatures. Under optimized\nconditions we obtain 4 {\\mu}m long nanotubes that are well adherent to the\nsubstrate and can be grown very homogenous over large surface areas. Moreover,\nthe key advantage of this approach is that an open top morphology (initiation\nlayer free) is obtained. After a suitable conversion treatment in NH3\natmosphere Ta3N5 nanotubes are obtained, that after (Co-Pi+Co(OH)x)\nmodification provide, under AM 1.5G illumination conditions, a\nphotoelectrochemical current response of 4.7 mA cm-2 at 1.23 V vs RHE.\n", "  We present a model for generating probabilistic forecasts by combining kernel\ndensity estimation (KDE) and quantile regression techniques, as part of the\nprobabilistic load forecasting track of the Global Energy Forecasting\nCompetition 2014. The KDE method is initially implemented with a time-decay\nparameter. We later improve this method by conditioning on the temperature or\nthe period of the week variables to provide more accurate forecasts. Secondly,\nwe develop a simple but effective quantile regression forecast. The novel\naspects of our methodology are two-fold. First, we introduce symmetry into the\ntime-decay parameter of the kernel density estimation based forecast. Secondly\nwe combine three probabilistic forecasts with different weights for different\nperiods of the month.\n", "  Flares we observe on stars in white light, UV or soft X-rays are probably\nharbingers of coronal mass ejections (CMEs). If we use the Sun as a guide,\nlarge stellar flares will dissipate two orders of magnitude less X-ray\nradiative energy than the kinetic energy in the associated CME. Since coronal\nemission on active stars appears to be dominated by flare activity, CMEs pose a\nquandary for understanding the fraction of their energy budget stars can spend\non magnetic activity. One answer is magnetic suppression of CMEs, in which the\nstrong large-scale fields of active stars entrap and prevent CMEs unless their\nfree energy exceeds a critical value. The CME-less flaring active region NOAA\n2192 presents a possible solar analogue of this. Monster CMEs will still exist,\nand have the potential to ravage planetary atmospheres.\n", "  The present paper examines the influence of a nonlinear relationship between\nthe local oxygen-vacancy concentration and the local resistivity on resistive\nswitching effects in complex oxides. The continuity equation has been used as a\nmodel for the motion of oxygen vacancies when a periodic time-dependent\nelectrical current is applied. The question of endurance of the switching\ncycles is discussed. It is found that nonlinearity of the\nresistivity-concentration dependence enhances the endurance.\n", "  In the present review we try to give a comprehensive and most up to date view\nto the field, with an emphasis on the currently most investigated anodic TiO2\nnanotube arrays. We will first give an overview of different synthesis\napproaches to produce TiO2 nanotubes and TiO2 nanotube arrays, and then deal\nwith physical and chemical properties of TiO2 nanotubes and techniques to\nmodify them. Finally, we will provide an overview of the most explored and\nprospective applications of nanotubular TiO2.\n", "  In the present work we use TiO2 nanotube arrays, carrying a Pt coating that\nis optimally dewetted, as a photocatalyst to generate H2. In order to achieve a\nmaximum H2-generation efficiency, on the one hand an ideal thermal dewetting of\nthe Pt layer into nanoparticles is needed that requires an oxygen free heat\ntreatment, and on the other hand an optimal crystallization of the TiO2\nnanotubes into anatase with reduced defect density is achieved only by\nannealing in O2 containing environment. To overcome this issue, we combine\nadequate reducing and oxidizing conditions in a multiple annealing treatment,\nand obtain Pt-decorated anatase TiO2 nanotubes showing significantly enhanced\nphotocatalytic H2 generation ability.\n", "  In the present work we explore the front- and back-side performance of a\nphotocatalytic platform consisting of self-organized TiO2 nanotube layers\nformed by complete anodization of Ti metal films evaporated on quartz slides.\nThe adhesion and light transmission of the tube layers on the quartz surfaces\nare optimized by a suitable anodization procedure. After their growth, the\nnanotube arrays were converted into crystalline structures and sputter-coated\nwith co-catalytic Pt nanoparticles. The optically transparent quartz substrates\nenable the use of the Pt-decorated tube layers for photocatalytic H2 generation\nunder either front- or back-side illumination configurations. The nanotube\nfilms on quartz are characterized in view of their physico-chemical properties,\nincluding their light transmission features measured using different light\nsources. The results show that the front-side illumination under optimized\nfactors, i.e., the amount of loaded co-catalyst, yields a maximized\nphotocatalytic performance in terms of H2 generation.\n", "  We discuss the potential of AFTER@LHC to measure single-transverse-spin\nasymmetries in open-charm and bottomonium production. With a HERMES-like\nhydrogen polarised target, such measurements over a year can reach precisions\nclose to the per cent level. This is particularly remarkable since these\nanalyses can probably not be carried out anywhere else\n", "  The spatiotemporal oscillation patterns of the proteins MinD and MinE are\nused by the bacterium E. coli to sense its own geometry. Strikingly, both\ncomputer simulations and experiments have recently shown that for the same\ngeometry of the reaction volume, different oscillation patterns can be stable,\nwith stochastic switching between them. Here we use particle-based Brownian\ndynamics simulations to predict the relative frequency of different oscillation\npatterns over a large range of three-dimensional compartment geometries, in\nexcellent agreement with experimental results. Fourier analyses as well as\npattern recognition algorithms are used to automatically identify the different\noscillation patterns and the switching rates between them. We also identify\nnovel oscillation patterns in three-dimensional compartments with\nmembrane-covered walls and identify a linear relation between the bound\nMin-protein densities and the volume-to-surface ratio. In general, our work\nshows how geometry sensing is limited by multistability and stochastic\nfluctuations.\n", "  The anomalous achromatic mirror operating in near-IR and visible frequency\nrange was designed using an array of metal-insulator-metal (MIM) resonators. An\nincident wave interacting with MIM resonator experiences phase shift that is\nequal to the optical path travelled by the gap plasmon, excited by the wave.\nThe phase gradient along the mirror surface is created through the difference\nin plasmons optical paths in resonators of different lengths. In the frequency\nregion well below the plasma frequency of the metal, the phase gradient is a\nlinear function of frequency, and thus the mirror operates in achromatic\nregime, i.e. reflection angle does not depend on the radiation frequency. Using\nsilver-air-silver resonators, we predicted that the mirror can steer normally\nincident beam to angles as large as 40$^{\\circ}$ with high radiation efficiency\n(exceeding 98 $\\%$) and small Joule losses (below 10 $\\%$).\n", "  A quantum network promises to enable long distance quantum communication, and\nassemble small quantum devices into a large quantum computing cluster. Each\nnetwork node can thereby be seen as a small few qubit quantum computer. Qubits\ncan be sent over direct physical links connecting nearby quantum nodes, or by\nmeans of teleportation over pre-established entanglement amongst distant\nnetwork nodes. Such pre-shared entanglement effectively forms a shortcut - a\nvirtual quantum link - which can be used exactly once.\n  Here, we present an abstraction of a quantum network that allows ideas from\ncomputer science to be applied to the problem of routing qubits, and manage\nentanglement in the network. Specifically, we consider a scenario in which each\nquantum network node can create EPR pairs with its immediate neighbours over a\nphysical connection, and perform entanglement swapping operations in order to\ncreate long distance virtual quantum links. We proceed to discuss the features\nunique to quantum networks, which call for the development of new routing\ntechniques. As an example, we present two simple hierarchical routing schemes\nfor a quantum network of N nodes for a ring and sphere topology. For these\ntopologies we present efficient routing algorithms requiring O(log N) qubits to\nbe stored at each network node, O(polylog N) time and space to perform routing\ndecisions, and O(log N) timesteps to replenish the virtual quantum links in a\nmodel of entanglement generation.\n", "  We present a detailed theoretical investigation of persistent spin helices in\ntwo-dimensional electron systems with spin-orbit coupling. For this purpose we\nconsider a single-particle effective mass Hamiltonian with generalized\nlinear-in-k spin-orbit coupling term corresponding to a quantum well grown in\nan arbitrary crystallographic direction, and derive the general condition for\nthe formation of the persistent spin helix. This condition applied for the\nHamiltonians describing quantum wells with different growth directions\nindicates the possibility of existence of the persistent spin helix in a wide\nclass of 2D systems apart from [001] model with equal Rashba and Dresselhaus\nspin-orbit coupling strengths and the [110] Dresselhaus model. In addition, we\nemploy the translation operator formalism for analytical calculation of\nspace-resolved spin density and visualization of the persistent spin helix\npatterns.\n", "  We present an overview of the performance of the Neutralized Drift\nCompression Experiment-II (NDCX-II) accelerator at Berkeley Lab, and summarize\nrecent studies of material properties created with nanosecond and\nmillimeter-scale ion beam pulses. The scientific topics being explored include\nthe dynamics of ion induced damage in materials, materials synthesis far from\nequilibrium, warm dense matter and intense beam-plasma physics. We summarize\nthe improved accelerator performance, diagnostics and results of beam-induced\nirradiation of thin samples of, e.g., tin and silicon. Bunches with over\n3x10^10 ions, 1- mm radius, and 2-30 ns FWHM duration have been created. To\nachieve these short pulse durations and mm-scale focal spot radii, the 1.2 MeV\nHe+ ion beam is neutralized in a drift compression section which removes the\nspace charge defocusing effect during final compression and focusing.\nQuantitative comparison of detailed particle-in-cell simulations with the\nexperiment play an important role in optimizing accelerator performance; these\nkeep pace with the accelerator repetition rate of ~1/minute.\n", "  The Intelligent Driver Model is studied and several drawbacks with respect to\ndriving simulators are defined. We present two modifications of the IDM. The\nfirst one gives any predefined distance to the leading vehicle in a steady\nstate. The second modification is a combination of the first one and the\noptimal velocity model. It takes into account drivers reaction time explicitly\nand is described by delay differential equation. This model always results in\nrealistic vehicles accelerations what allows simulating real traffic\ncollisions. Necessary and sufficient conditions are obtained, that guarantee a\nnon-oscillating solution near the equilibrium for the vehicle platoon. We\nsuggest the calibrating framework based on a numerical solution of the\nconstrained optimization problem. Nonlinear constraints are generated by the\nnumerical integration scheme. The suggested procedure incorporates the local\nstability conditions obtained and takes into account vehicle dynamics, drivers\nbehavior and weather conditions.\n", "  In Computational Fluid Dynamics there have been many attempts to combine the\npower of a fixed mesh on which to carry out spatial calculations with that of a\nset of particles that moves following the velocity field. These ideas indeed go\nback to Particle-in-Cell methods, proposed about 60 years ago.\n  Of course, some procedure is needed to transfer field information between\nparticles and mesh. There are many possible choices for this \"assignment\", or\n\"projection\".\n  Several requirements may guide this choice. Two well-known ones are\nconservativity and stability, which apply to volume integrals of the fields.\n  An additional one is here considered: preservation of information. This means\nthat mesh interpolation, followed by mesh assignment, should leave the field\nvalues invariant. The resulting methods are termed \"mass\" assignments due to\ntheir strong similarities with the Finite Element Method.\n  We test several procedures, including the well-known FLIP, on three\nscenarios: simple 1D convection, 2D convection of Zalesak's disk, and a CFD\nsimulation of the Taylor-Green periodic vortex sheet. The most symmetric mass\nassignment is seen to be clearly superior to other methods.\n", "  The sensitivity (i.e. dynamic response) of complex networked systems has not\nbeen well understood, making difficult to predict whether new macroscopic\ndynamic behavior will emerge even if we know exactly how individual nodes\nbehave and how they are coupled. Here we build a framework to quantify the\nsensitivity of complex networked system of coupled dynamic units. We\ncharacterize necessary and sufficient conditions for the emergence of new\nmacroscopic dynamic behavior in the thermodynamic limit. We prove that these\nconditions are satisfied only for architectures with power-law degree\ndistributions. Surprisingly, we find that highly connected nodes (i.e. hubs)\nonly dominate the sensitivity of the network up to certain critical frequency.\n", "  The quantum effects encapsulated in loop corrections are crucial in quantum\nfield theory for a wide variety of formal and phenomenological applications. In\nthis article we propose and check a definition of the so-called single cut\ncontributions needed to complete on-shell recursion relations for the integrand\nof scattering amplitudes in generic power-counting renormalisable theories at\nconjecturally any loop order. Our proposal meshes well with standard\ndimensional regularisation and applies in particular directly to much of the\nstandard model of particle physics. Apart from a diagrammatic construction, at\none loop order we provide a direct cross-check for box coefficients.\nInterestingly, at one loop our proposal can be related to a specific subset of\nall double unitarity cuts as well as tree-level poles by iterated recursion. We\nfocus in particular on demonstrating the method in rational-term one-loop\nexamples in pure Yang-Mills theory. For the finite amplitudes we present\nall-order arguments. First steps toward gravity integrands are taken.\n", "  Flat-panel cone-beam CT (CBCT) has been applied clinically in a number of\nhigh-resolution applications. Increasing geometric magnification can\npotentially improve resolution, but also increases blur due to an extended\nx-ray focal-spot. We present a shift-variant focal-spot blur model and\nincorporate it into a model-based iterative-reconstruction algorithm. We apply\nthis algorithm to simulation and CBCT test-bench data. In a trabecular bone\nsimulation study, we find traditional reconstruction approaches without a blur\nmodel exhibit shift-variant resolution properties that depend greatly on the\nacquisition protocol (e.g. short vs. full scans) and the anode angles of the\nrays used to reconstruct a particular region. For physical CBCT experiments\nfocal spot blur was characterized and a spatial resolution phantom was scanned\nand reconstructed. In both experiments image quality using the shift-variant\nmodel was significantly improved over approaches that modeled no blur or only a\nshift-invariant blur, suggesting a potential means to overcome traditional CBCT\nspatial resolution and system design limitations.\n", "  We used the Disk Detective citizen science project and the BANYAN II Bayesian\nanalysis tool to identify a new candidate member of a nearby young association\nwith infrared excess. WISE J080822.18-644357.3, an M5.5-type debris disk system\nwith significant excess at both 12 and 22 $\\mu$m, is a likely member ($\\sim\n90\\%$ BANYAN II probability) of the $\\sim 45$ Myr-old Carina association. Since\nthis would be the oldest M dwarf debris disk detected in a moving group, this\ndiscovery could be an important constraint on our understanding of M dwarf\ndebris disk evolution.\n", "  We present strategies how to reconstruct (estimate) properties of a quantum\nchannel described by the map E based on incomplete measurements. In a\nparticular case of a qubit channel a complete reconstruction of the map E can\nbe performed via complete tomography of four output states E[rho_j ] that\noriginate from a set of four linearly independent test states j (j = 1, 2, 3,\n4) at the input of the channel. We study the situation when less than four\nlinearly independent states are transmitted via the channel and measured at the\noutput. We present strategies how to reconstruct the channel when just one, two\nor three states are transmitted via the channel. In particular, we show that if\njust one state is transmitted via the channel then the best reconstruction can\nbe achieved when this state is a total mixture described by the density\noperator rho = I/2. To improve the reconstruction procedure one has to send via\nthe channel more states. The best strategy is to complement the total mixture\nwith pure states that are mutually orthogonal in the sense of the Bloch-sphere\nrepresentation. We show that unitary transformations (channels) can be uniquely\nreconstructed (determined) based on the information of how three properly\nchosen input states are transformed under the action of the channel.\n"]}
