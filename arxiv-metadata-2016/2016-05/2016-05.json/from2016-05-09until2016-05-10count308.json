combination of two complementary types of\nclassical information, \"amplitude\" and \"phase\". Here I show how this intuition\ncan be used to construct two new conditions for approximate quantum error\ncorrection. The first states that entanglement is locally recoverable from a\nbipartite state when one system can be used to approximately predict the\noutcomes of two complementary observables on the other. The second, more in the\nspirit of the recent decoupling approach, states that entanglement is locally\nrecoverable when the environment cannot reliably predict either.\n", "  In the past 20 years, compactifications of the families of curves in\nalgebraic varieties X have been studied via stable maps, Hilbert schemes,\nstable pairs, unramified maps, and stable quotients. Each path leads to a\ndifferent enumeration of curves. A common thread is the use of a 2-term\ndeformation/obstruction theory to define a virtual fundamental class. The\nrichest geometry occurs when X is a nonsingular projective variety of dimension\n3.\n  We survey here the 13/2 principal ways to count curves with special attention\nto the 3-fold case. The different theories are linked by a web of conjectural\nrelationships which we highlight. Our goal is to provide a guide for graduate\nstudents looking for an elementary route into the subject.\n", "  We develop a theory of \\emph{reduced} Gromov-Witten and stable pair\ninvariants of surfaces and their canonical bundles.\n  We show that classical Severi degrees are special cases of these invariants.\nThis proves a special case of the MNOP conjecture, and allows us to generalise\nthe G\\\"ottsche conjecture to the non-ample case. In a sequel we prove this\ngeneralisation.\n  We prove a remarkable property of the moduli space of stable pairs on a\nsurface. It is the zero locus of a section of a bundle on a smooth compact\nambient space, making calculation with the reduced virtual cycle possible.\n", "  System identification is a key enabling component for the implementation of\nquantum technologies, including quantum control. In this paper, we consider the\nclass of passive linear input-output systems, and investigate several basic\nquestions: (1) which parameters can be identified? (2) Given sufficient\ninput-output data, how do we reconstruct the system parameters? (3) How can we\noptimize the estimation precision by preparing appropriate input states and\nperforming measurements on the output? We show that minimal systems can be\nidentified up to a unitary transformation on the modes, and systems satisfying\na Hamiltonian connectivity condition called \"infecting\" are completely\nidentifiable. We propose a frequency domain design based on a Fisher\ninformation criterion, for optimizing the estimation precision for coherent\ninput state. As a consequence of the unitarity of the transfer function, we\nshow that the Heisenberg limit with respect to the input energy can be achieved\nusing non-classical input states.\n", "  A study on a method for the establishment of a phase space representation of\nquantum theory is presented. The approach utilizes the properties of Gaussian\ndistribution, the properties of Hermite polynomials, Fourier analysis and the\ncurrent formulation of quantum mechanics which is based on the use of Hilbert\nspace and linear operators theory. Phase space representation of quantum states\nand wave functions in phase space are introduced using properties of a set of\nfunctions called harmonic Gaussian functions. Then, new operators called\ndispersion operators are defined and identified as the operators which admit as\neigenstates the basis states of the phase space representation. Generalization\nof the approach for multidimensional cases is shown. Examples of applications\nare given.\n", "  In this paper we identify all simply connected 3-dimensional real Lie groups\nwhich admit Randers or Matsumoto metrics of Berwald type with a certain\nunderlying left invariant Riemannian metric. Then we give their flag curvatures\nformulas explicitly.\n", "  Since the 1928 seminal work of Dirac, and its subsequent development by\nWeinberg, a view is held that there is a unique Fermi field of spin one-half.\nIt is endowed with mass dimension three-half. Combined, these characteristics\nprofoundly affect the phenomenology of the high energy physics, astrophysics,\nand cosmology. We here present a counter example by providing a local, mass\ndimension one, Fermi field of spin one-half. The theory, inter alia, thus\nallows dimensionless quartic self interaction for the new fermions, and its\nonly other dimensionless coupling is quadratic in the new fermions and in the\nstandard-model scalar field. For these reasons, the immediate application of\nthe new theory resides in the dark-matter sector of physical reality. The\nlowest-mass associated new particle may leave its unique signature at the Large\nHadron Collider. We discuss in detail the theoretical crevice that allows the\nexistence of the new quantum field.\n", "  Landau's symmetry breaking theory is the basis of modern condensed matter\nphysics, from which most phases can be understood. The recent discovery of\ntopological insulators simulates the study on the topological phase which is\nbeyond this theory. An interesting question is whether the topological phase\nand spontaneous symmetry breaking order can coexist. We study this problem\nbased on the topological phase in the Haldane model. Firstly by including a\nstaggered potential, we show that if the system is subjected to the symmetry\nneeded by the charge density wave (CDW) order in advance, the topological phase\ncan coexist with the CDW order, realizing the topological CDW phase. While when\nthe nearest neighor interaction which preserves the symmetry of the origin\nHamiltonian is included, the CDW order can not develop from spontaneous\nsymmetry breaking in the topological phase. The results imply that a\nspontaneous symmetry breaking order may not develop in a topological phase.\n", "  The inverse stellar structure problem determines the equation of state of the\nmatter in stars from a knowledge of their macroscopic observables (e.g. their\nmasses and radii). This problem was solved in a previous paper by constructing\na spectral representation of the equation of state whose stellar models match a\nprescribed set of macroscopic observables. This paper improves and extends that\nwork in two significant ways: i) The method is made more robust by accounting\nfor an unexpected feature of the enthalpy based representations of the\nequations of state used in this work. After making the appropriate\nmodifications, accurate initial guesses for the spectral parameters are no\nlonger needed so Monte-Carlo techniques can now be used to ensure the best fit\nto the observables. ii) The method is extended here to use masses and tidal\ndeformabilities (which will be measured by gravitational wave observations of\nneutron-star mergers) as the macroscopic observables instead of masses and\nradii. The accuracy and reliability of this extended and more robust spectral\nmethod is evaluated in this paper using mock data for observables from stars\nbased on 34 different theoretical models of the high density neutron-star\nequation of state. In qualitative agreement with earlier work, these tests\nsuggest the high density part of the neutron-star equation of state could be\ndetermined at the few-percent accuracy level using high quality measurements of\nthe masses and radii (or masses and tidal deformabilities) of just two or three\nneutron stars.\n", "  We use density functional theory to explore the interplay between octahedral\nrotations and ferroelectricity in the model compound SrTiO$_3$. We find that\nover the experimentally relevant range octahedral rotations suppress\nferroelectricity as is generally assumed in the literature. Somewhat\nsurprisingly we observe that at larger angles the previously weakened\nferroelectric instability strengthens significantly. By analysing geometry\nchanges, energetics, force constants and charges, we explain the mechanisms\nbehind this transition from competition to cooperation with increasing\noctahedral rotation angle.\n", "  We present a novel method to measure the strength of interstellar magnetic\nfields based on ultraviolet (UV) polarization of starlight, which is in part\nproduced by weakly aligned, small interstellar grains. We begin with\ncalculating degrees of alignment of small (size $a\\sim 0.01\\mu$m) and very\nsmall ($a\\sim 0.001\\mu$m) grains in the interstellar magnetic field due to the\nDavis-Greenstein paramagnetic relaxation and resonance paramagnetic relaxation.\nWe compute the degrees of paramagnetic alignment with the ambient magnetic\nfield $B$ using Langevin equations. In this paper, we take into account various\nprocesses essential for the dynamics of small grains, including infrared (IR)\nemission, electric dipole emission, plasma drag and collisions with neutral and\nionized species. We find that the alignment of small grains is necessary to\nreproduce the observed polarization in the UV, although the polarization\narising from these small grains is negligible at the optical and IR\nwavelengths. Based on fitting theoretical models to observed extinction and\npolarization curves, we find that the best-fit model requires a higher degree\nof alignment of small grains for the case with the peak wavelength of\npolarization $\\lambda_{\\max}<0.55\\mu$m, which exhibits an excess UV\npolarization relative to the Serkowski law, compared to the typical case\n$\\lambda_{\\max}=0.55\\mu$m. We interpret the correlation between the systematic\nincrease of the UV polarization relative to maximum polarization (i.e. of\n$p(6\\mu m^{-1})/p_{\\max}$) with $\\lambda_{\\max}^{-1}$ by appealing to the\nhigher degree of alignment of small grains. We identify paramagnetic relaxation\nas the cause of the alignment of small grains and utilize the dependence of the\ndegree of alignment on the magnetic field strength $B$ to suggest a new way to\nmeasure $B$ using the observable parameters $\\lambda_{\\max}$ and $p(6\\mu\nm^{-1})/p_{\\max}$.[Abridged]\n", "  We explain that spectral networks are a unifying framework that incorporates\nboth shear (Fock-Goncharov) and length-twist (Fenchel-Nielsen) coordinate\nsystems on moduli spaces of flat SL(2,C) connections, in the following sense.\nGiven a spectral network W on a punctured Riemann surface C, we explain the\nprocess of \"abelianization\" which relates flat SL(2)-connections (with an\nadditional structure called \"W-framing\") to flat C*-connections on a covering.\nFor any W, abelianization gives a construction of a local Darboux coordinate\nsystem on the moduli space of W-framed flat connections. There are two special\ntypes of spectral network, combinatorially dual to ideal triangulations and\npants decompositions; these two types of network lead to Fock-Goncharov and\nFenchel-Nielsen coordinates respectively.\n", "  We analyze the persistence of curvature singularities when analyzed using\nquantum theory. First, quantum test particles obeying the Klein-Gordon and\nChandrasekhar-Dirac equation are used to probe the classical timelike naked\nsingularity. We show that the classical singularity is felt even by our quantum\nprobes. Next, we use loop quantization to resolve singularity hidden beneath\nthe horizon. The singularity is resolved in this case.\n", "  Monod and Beuneu [Monod and Beuneu, Phys. Rev. B 19, 911 (1979)] established\nthe validity of the Elliott-Yafet theory for elemental metals through\ncorrelating the experimental electron spin resonance line-width with the\nso-called spin-orbit admixture coefficients and the momentum-relaxation theory.\nThe spin-orbit admixture coefficients data were based on atomic spin-orbit\nsplitting. We highlight two shortcomings of the previous description: i) the\nmomentum-relaxation involves the Debye temperature and the electron-phonon\ncoupling whose variation among the elemental metals was neglected, ii) the\nElliott-Yafet theory involves matrix elements of the spin-orbit coupling (SOC),\nwhich are however not identical to the SOC induced energy splitting of the\natomic levels, even though the two have similar magnitudes. We obtain the\nempirical spin-orbit admixture parameters for the alkali metals by considering\nthe proper description of the momentum relaxation theory. In addition, we\npresent a model calculation which highlights the difference between the SOC\nmatrix element and energy splitting.\n", "  Networks are widely used to represent interaction pattern among the\ncomponents in complex systems. Structures of real networks from differ- ent\ndomains may vary quite significantly. Since there is an interplay be- tween\nnetwork architecture and dynamics, structure plays an important role in\ncommunication and information spreading on a network. Here we investigate the\nunderlying undirected topology of different biological networks which support\nfaster spreading of information and are better in communication. We analyze the\ngood expansion property by using the spectral gap and communicability between\nnodes. Different epidemic models are also used to study the transmission of\ninformation in terms of disease spreading through individuals (nodes) in those\nnetworks. More- over, we explore the structural conformation and properties\nwhich may be responsible for better communication. Among all biological\nnetworks studied here, the undirected structure of neuronal networks not only\npos- sesses the small-world property but the same is expressed remarkably to a\nhigher degree than any randomly generated network which possesses the same\ndegree sequence. A relatively high percentage of nodes, in neuronal networks,\nform a higher core in their structure. Our study shows that the underlying\nundirected topology in neuronal networks is significantly qualitatively\ndifferent than the same from other biological networks and that they may have\nevolved in such a way that they inherit a (undirected) structure which is\nexcellent and robust in communication.\n", "  In terms of the matrix valued Berry gauge field strength for the Weyl\nHamiltonian in any even spacetime dimensions a symplectic form whose elements\nare matrices in spin indices is introduced. Definition of the volume form is\nmodified appropriately. A simple method of finding the path integral measure\nand the chiral current in the presence of external electromagnetic fields is\npresented. It is shown that within this new approach the chiral magnetic effect\nas well as the chiral anomaly in even d+1 dimensions are accomplished\nstraightforwardly.\n", "  The Holstein model has been widely accepted as a model comprising electrons\ninteracting with phonons; analysis of this model's ground states was\naccomplished two decades ago. However, the results were obtained without\ncompletely taking repulsive Coulomb interactions into account. Recent progress\nhas made it possible to treat such interactions rigorously; in this paper, we\nstudy the Holstein--Hubbard model with repulsive Coulomb interactions. The\nground state properties of the model are investigated; in particular, the\nground state of the Hamiltonian is proven to be unique for an even number of\nelectrons on a bipartite connected lattice. In addition, we provide a rigorous\nupper bound on charge susceptibility.\n", "  Topological insulators (TIs) exhibit many exotic properties. In particular, a\ntopological magneto-electric (TME) effect, quantized in units of the fine\nstructure constant, exists in TIs. In this Letter, we study theoretically the\nscattering properties of electromagnetic waves by TI circular cylinders\nparticularly in the Rayleigh scattering limit. Compared with ordinary\ndielectric cylinders, the scattering by TI cylinders shows many unusual\nfeatures due to the TME effect. Two proposals are suggested to determine the\nTME effect of TIs simply based on measuring the electric-field components of\nscattered waves in the far field at one or two scattering angles. Our results\ncould also offer a way to measure the fine structure constant.\n", "  In this paper we report on a search for short-duration gravitational wave\nbursts in the frequency range 64 Hz-1792 Hz associated with gamma-ray bursts\n(GRBs), using data from GEO600 and one of the LIGO or Virgo detectors. We\nintroduce the method of a linear search grid to analyse GRB events with large\nsky localisation uncertainties such as the localisations provided by the Fermi\nGamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM). Coherent searches for gravitational waves (GWs)\ncan be computationally intensive when the GRB sky position is not\nwell-localised, due to the corrections required for the difference in arrival\ntime between detectors. Using a linear search grid we are able to reduce the\ncomputational cost of the analysis by a factor of O(10) for GBM events.\nFurthermore, we demonstrate that our analysis pipeline can improve upon the sky\nlocalisation of GRBs detected by the GBM, if a high-frequency GW signal is\nobserved in coincidence. We use the linear search grid method in a search for\nGWs associated with 129 GRBs observed satellite-based gamma-ray experiments\nbetween 2006 and 2011. The GRBs in our sample had not been previously analysed\nfor GW counterparts. A fraction of our GRB events are analysed using data from\nGEO600 while the detector was using squeezed-light states to improve its\nsensitivity; this is the first search for GWs using data from a squeezed-light\ninterferometric observatory. We find no evidence for GW signals, either with\nany individual GRB in this sample or with the population as a whole. For each\nGRB we place lower bounds on the distance to the progenitor, assuming a fixed\nGW emission energy of $10^{-2} M_{\\odot}c^{2}$, with a median exclusion\ndistance of 0.8 Mpc for emission at 500 Hz and 0.3 Mpc at 1 kHz. The reduced\ncomputational cost associated with a linear search grid will enable rapid\nsearches for GWs associated with Fermi GBM events in the Advanced detector era.\n", "  We present a densely-sampled, homogeneous set of light curves of 64 low\nredshift (z < 0.05) stripped-envelope supernovae (SN of type IIb, Ib, Ic and\nIc-bl). These data were obtained between 2001 and 2009 at the Fred L. Whipple\nObservatory (FLWO) on Mt. Hopkins in Arizona, with the optical FLWO 1.2-m and\nthe near-infrared PAIRITEL 1.3-m telescopes. Our dataset consists of 4543\noptical photometric measurements on 61 SN, including a combination of UBVRI,\nUBVr'i', and u'BVr'i', and 2142 JHKs near-infrared measurements on 25 SN. This\nsample constitutes the most extensive multi-color data set of stripped-envelope\nSN to date. Our photometry is based on template-subtracted images to eliminate\nany potential host galaxy light contamination. This work presents these\nphotometric data, compares them with data in the literature, and estimates\nbasic statistical quantities: date of maximum, color, and photometric\nproperties. We identify promising color trends that may permit the\nidentification of stripped-envelope SN subtypes from their photometry alone.\nMany of these SN were observed spectroscopically by the CfA SN group, and the\nspectra are presented in a companion paper (Modjaz et al. 2014). A thorough\nexploration that combines the CfA photometry and spectroscopy of\nstripped-envelope core-collapse SN will be presented in a follow-up paper.\n", "  We study Dirac-harmonic maps from surfaces to manifolds with torsion, which\nis motivated from the superstring action considered in theoretical physics. We\ndiscuss analytic and geometric properties of such maps and outline an existence\nresult for uncoupled solutions.\n", "  We develop a phenomenological theory to predict the characteristic features\nof the momentum-dependent scattering amplitude in resonant inelastic x-ray\nscattering (RIXS) at the energy scale of the superconducting gap in iron-based\nsuperconductors. Taking into account all relevant orbital states as well as\ntheir specific content along the Fermi surface we evaluate the charge and spin\ndynamical structure factors for the compounds LaOFeAs and LiFeAs, based on\ntight-binding models which are fully consistent with recent angle-resolved\nphotoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) data. We find a characteristic intensity\nredistribution between charge and spin dynamical structure factors which\ndiscriminates between sign-reversing and sign-preserving quasiparticle\nexcitations. Consequently, our results show that RIXS spectra can distinguish\nbetween $s_\\pm$ and $s_{++}$ wave gap functions in the singlet pairing case. In\naddition, we find that an analogous intensity redistribution at small momenta\ncan reveal the presence of a chiral $p$-wave triplet pairing.\n", "  In this paper, we provide the R\\'enyi entropy and complexity measure for a\nnovel, flexible class of skew-gaussian distributions and their related\nfamilies, as a characteristic form of the skew-gaussian Shannon entropy. We\ngive closed expressions considering a more general class of closed\nskew-gaussian distributions and the weighted moments estimation method. In\naddition, closed expressions of R\\'enyi entropy are presented for extended\nskew-gaussian and truncated skew-gaussian distributions. Finally, additional\ninequalities for skew-gaussian and extended skew-gaussian R\\'enyi and Shannon\nentropies are reported.\n", "  This research implements a design for the control of a rotatable stabiliser\nwhich, it is proposed, might augment, or fully replace, the conventional\ncontrol mechanisms for pitch and yaw in certain types of aircraft. The\nanticipated advantages of such a device are around 25% less drag, for a\ncapability which ranges between equivalent and greater than twofold that of a\nconventional tail. The tail of a popular, radio-controlled, model aircraft is\nreplaced with a rotatable stabiliser and its rotation is effected by way of a\ncontinuously-rotating servo, modified with a potentiometer. Two hollow,\ncarbon-fibre shafts (one sleeved within the other so as to allow free rotation)\nserve as the mechanical link between the servo and the tail. Inserting wiring\nalong the full length of the innermost shaft and incorporating three slip rings\ninto its collar, at the forward, servo end, facilitated an electrical supply to\nthe tail. A mapping betweeen the position of the controls and states of the\nstabiliser is formulated. Small and continuous adjustments cause the stabiliser\nto rotate in the opposite direction to the controls (when viewed from aft) and\nthe deflection of the hinged control surface is proportional to the radial\ndisplacement of the controls from their centred position. For what would amount\nto large and contradictory rotations of the device in terms of this protocol\n(rotations greater than 90$^\\circ$), the desired configuration can be more\nefficiently achieved by regarding the device's original orientation to differ\nby 180$^\\circ$ from what it actually is and by reversing the sign of the\ndeflection. One consequence of this latter mode of control is that a\nsymmetrical aerofoil is indicated. General flight, including static\nlongitudinal and directional stability, was not found to be compromised.\n", "  In this work, a growing network model that can generate a random network with\nfinite degree in infinite time is studied. The dynamics are governed by a rule\nwhere the degree increases under a scheme similar to the Malthus-Verhulst model\nin the context of population growth. The degree distribution is analysed in\nboth stationary and time-dependent regimes through some exact results and\nsimulations, and a scaling behaviour is found in asymptotically large time. For\nfinite times, the time-dependent degree distribution displays an accumulation\nof hubs as a result of competition between attractive and repulsive terms in\nlinking probability.\n", "  We use a finite temperature effective field theory recently developed for\nsuperfluid Fermi gases to investigate the properties of dark solitons in these\nsuperfluids. Our approach provides an analytic solution for the dip in the\norder parameter and the phase profile accross the soliton, which can be\ncompared with results obtained in the framework of the Bogoliubov - de Gennes\nequations. We present results in the whole range of the BCS-BEC crossover, for\narbitrary temperatures, and taking into account Gaussian fluctuations about the\nsaddle point. The obtained analytic solutions yield an exact energy-momentum\nrelation for a dark soliton showing that the soliton in a Fermi gas behaves\nlike a classical particle even at nonzero temperatures. The spatial profile of\nthe pair field and for the parameters of state for the soliton are analytically\nstudied. In the strong-coupling regime and/or for sufficiently high\ntemperatures, the obtained analytic solutions match well the numeric results\nobtained using the Bogoliubov - de Gennes equations.\n", "  Since microscopic velocity diffusion can be incorporated into general\nrelativity in a consistent way, we study cosmological background solutions when\nthe diffusion phenomena takes place in an expanding universe. Our focus here\nrelies on the nature of the diffusion coefficient $\\sigma$ which measures the\nmagnitude of such transport phenomena. We test dynamics where $\\sigma$ has a\nphenomenological dependence on the scale factor, the matter density, the dark\nenergy and the expansion rate.\n", "  We consider the problem of explaining the emergence and evolution of\ncooperation in dynamic network-structured populations. Building on seminal work\nby Poncela et al, which shows how cooperation (in one-shot prisoner's dilemma)\nis supported in growing populations by an evolutionary preferential attachment\n(EPA) model, we investigate the effect of fluctuations in the population size.\nWe find that the fluctuating model is more robust than Poncela et al's in that\ncooperation flourishes for a wide variety of initial conditions. In terms of\nboth the temptation to defect, and the types of strategies present in the\nfounder network, the fluctuating population is found to lead more securely to\ncooperation. Further, we find that this model will also support the emergence\nof cooperation from pre-existing non-cooperative random networks. This model,\nlike Poncela et al's, does not require agents to have memory, recognition of\nother agents, or other cognitive abilities, and so may suggest a more general\nexplanation of the emergence of cooperation in early evolutionary transitions,\nthan mechanisms such as kin selection, direct and indirect reciprocity.\n", "  For a graph $G$ and a related symmetric matrix $M$, the continuous-time\nquantum walk on $G$ relative to $M$ is defined as the unitary matrix $U(t) =\n\\exp(-itM)$, where $t$ varies over the reals. Perfect state transfer occurs\nbetween vertices $u$ and $v$ at time $\\tau$ if the $(u,v)$-entry of $U(\\tau)$\nhas unit magnitude. This paper studies quantum walks relative to graph\nLaplacians. Some main observations include the following closure properties for\nperfect state transfer:\n  (1) If a $n$-vertex graph has perfect state transfer at time $\\tau$ relative\nto the Laplacian, then so does its complement if $n\\tau$ is an integer multiple\nof $2\\pi$. As a corollary, the double cone over any $m$-vertex graph has\nperfect state transfer relative to the Laplacian if and only if $m \\equiv 2\n\\pmod{4}$. This was previously known for a double cone over a clique (S. Bose,\nA. Casaccino, S. Mancini, S. Severini, Int. J. Quant. Inf., 7:11, 2009).\n  (2) If a graph $G$ has perfect state transfer at time $\\tau$ relative to the\nnormalized Laplacian, then so does the weak product $G \\times H$ if for any\nnormalized Laplacian eigenvalues $\\lambda$ of $G$ and $\\mu$ of $H$, we have\n$\\mu(\\lambda-1)\\tau$ is an integer multiple of $2\\pi$. As a corollary, a weak\nproduct of $P_{3}$ with an even clique or an odd cube has perfect state\ntransfer relative to the normalized Laplacian. It was known earlier that a weak\nproduct of a circulant with odd integer eigenvalues and an even cube or a\nCartesian power of $P_{3}$ has perfect state transfer relative to the adjacency\nmatrix.\n  As for negative results, no path with four vertices or more has antipodal\nperfect state transfer relative to the normalized Laplacian. This almost\nmatches the state of affairs under the adjacency matrix (C. Godsil, Discrete\nMath., 312:1, 2011).\n", "  Dust grains may be accelerated to relativistic speeds by radiation pressure,\ndiffusive shocks, and other acceleration mechanisms. Such relativistic grains\nhave been suggested as primary particles of ultrahigh energy cosmic rays\n(UHECRs). In this paper, we first revisit the problem of acceleration by\nradiation pressure and calculate maximum grain velocities achieved. We find\nthat grains can be accelerated to relativistic speeds with Lorentz factor\n$\\gamma < 2$ by powerful radiation sources, which is lower than earlier\nestimates showing that $\\gamma$ could reach $\\sim 10$. We then investigate\ndifferent destruction mechanisms for relativistic grains traversing a variety\nof environments. In solar radiation, we find that the destruction by thermal\nsublimation and Coulomb explosions is important. We also quantify grain\ndestruction due to electronic sputtering by ions and grain-grain collisions.\nElectronic sputtering is found to be rather inefficient, whereas the\nevaporation following grain-grain collisions is shown to be an important\nmechanism for which the $a \\sim 0.01- 1\\mu$m grains would be destroyed after\nsweeping a gas column $N_{Coul}\\sim 5\\times 10^{19}-5\\times 10^{20}cm^{-2}$.\nRelativistic dust in the interstellar medium and intergalactic medium (IGM)\nwould be disrupted by Coulomb explosions due to collisional charging after\ntraversing a gas column $N_{Coul} \\sim 10^{17}cm^{-2}$ unless grain material is\nvery strong. We show that photoelectric emission by optical and ultraviolet\nbackground radiation is also significant for the destruction of relativistic\ndust in the IGM. The obtained results indicate that relativistic dust from\ngalaxies would be destroyed before reaching the Earth's atmosphere and unlikely\nto account for UHECRs.\n", "  Hawking effect was dug out of the gravitationally collapsed site forty years\nback when it was realised that quantum effects at the horizon could propagate\noutward to infinity giving rise to a thermal flux at late-times. However, the\nsituation regarding non-asymptotic observers was never completely clear. Also,\nrecently a debate has sprung in the community as to what would infalling\nobservers perceive while crossing the horizon. We set out to settle this\nquestion and more at least semi-classically in the articles [arXiv:1304.2858]\nand [arXiv:1404.0684] with a fresh approach. We introduce a new set of\ncoordinates that are regular everywhere, consider the adiabatic expansion of\ndetector response and its link to the trajectory-dependent `effective'\ntemperature/s and also local invariant observables, energy density and flux,\nbuilt from renormalized stress energy tensor. This paper is a concise summary\nof the new procedure and the results obtained thereof.\n", "  The energy band structure of a rotating BEC with a link in a\nquasi-one-dimensional torus and the role of dissipation is studied. Through\nthis study we are able to give a microscopic interpretation of hysteresis\nrecently observed in the experiment and we confirm that the hysteresis is the\nresult of the presence of metastable state. We consider of both the adiabatic\nchange and the instantaneous change of the rotation, and exhibit the\ndifferences between them. It is found that the sharp and size of the hysteresis\nloop change drastically with the strength of the link.\n", "  We theoretically demonstrate a mechanism for bright soliton generation in\nspinor non-equilibrium Bose-Einstein condensates made of atoms or\nquasiparticles such as polaritons in semiconductor microcavities. We give\nanalytical expressions for bright (half) solitons as minimizing functions of a\ngeneralized non-conservative Lagrangian elucidating the unique features of\ninter and intra-competition in non-equilibrium systems. The analytical results\nare supported by a detailed numerical analysis that further shows the rich\nsoliton dynamics inferred by their instability and mutual cross-interactions.\n", "  The kinetic friction and wear at high sliding speeds is investigated using\nthe head-disk interface of hard disk drives, wherein, the head and the disk are\nless than 10 nm apart and move at sliding speeds of 5-10 m/s relative to each\nother. While the spacing between the sliding surfaces is of the same order of\nmagnitude as various AFM based fundamental studies on friction, the sliding\nspeed is nearly six orders of magnitude larger, allowing a unique set-up for a\nsystematic study of nanoscale wear at high sliding speeds. In a hard disk\ndrive, the physical contact between the head and the disk leads to friction,\nwear and degradation of the head overcoat material (typically diamond like\ncarbon). In this work, strain gauge based friction measurements are performed;\nthe friction coefficient as well as the adhering shear strength at the\nhead-disk interface are extracted; and an experimental set-up for studying\nfriction between high speed sliding surfaces is exemplified.\n", "  We delineate a procedure to classify 6d N=(1,0) gauge theories composed, in\npart, of a semi-simple gauge group and hypermultiplets. We classify these\ntheories by requiring that they satisfy some consistency conditions. The\nprimary consistency condition is that the gauge anomaly can be cancelled by\nadding tensor multiplets which couple to the gauge fields by acting as sources\nof instanton strings. Based on the number of tensor multiplets required to\ncancel the anomaly, we conjecture that the UV completion of these consistent\ngauge theories (if it exists) should be either a 6d N=(1,0) SCFT or a 6d\nN=(1,0) little string theory.\n", "  We study Kerr nonlinear resonators (KNR) driven by a continuous wave field in\nquantum regimes where strong Kerr interactions give rise to selective resonant\nexcitations of oscillatory modes. We use an exact quantum theory of KNR in the\nframework of the Fokker-Planck equation without any quantum state truncation or\nperturbation procedure. This approach allows non-perturbative consideration of\nKNR for various quantum operational regimes including cascaded processes\nbetween oscillatory states. We focus on understanding of multi-photon\nnon-resonant and selective resonant excitations of introcavity mode depending\non the detuning, the amplitude of the driving field and the strength of\nnonlinearity. The analysis is provided on the base of photon number\ndistributions, the photon-number correlation function and the Wigner function.\n", "  We study the interaction effect in a three dimensional Dirac semimetal and\nfind that two competing orders, charge-density-wave orders and nematic orders,\ncan be induced to gap the Dirac points. Applying a magnetic field can further\ninduce an instability towards forming these ordered phases. The charge density\nwave phase is similar as that of a Weyl semimetal while the nematic phase is\nunique for Dirac semimetals. Gapless zero modes are found in the vortex core\nformed by nematic order parameters, indicating the topological nature of\nnematic phases. The nematic phase can be observed experimentally using scanning\ntunnelling microscopy.\n", "  We present a first-principles approach to describe magnetic and\nsuperconducting systems and the phenomena of competition between these\nelectronic effects. We develop a density functional theory: SpinSCDFT, by\nextending the Hohenberg-Kohn theorem and constructing the non-interacting Kohn-\nSham system. An exchange-correlation functional for SpinSCDFT is derived from\nthe Sham Schl\\\"uter connection between the SpinSCDFT Kohn-Sham and a\nself-energy in Eliashberg approximation. The reference Eliashberg equations for\nsuperconductors in the presence of magnetism are also derived and discussed.\n", "  We numerically investigate the Spin Density Functional theory for\nsuperconductors (SpinSCDFT) and the approximated exchange-correlation\nfunctional, derived and presented in the preceding paper I. As a test system we\nemploy a free electron gas featuring an exchange-splitting, a phononic pairing\nfield and a Coulomb repulsion. SpinSCDFT results are compared with Sarma, the\nBardeen Cooper and Schrieffer theory and with an Eliashberg type of approach.\nWe find that the spectrum of the superconducting Kohn-Sham SpinSCDFT system is\nnot in agreement with the true quasi particle structure. Therefore, starting\nfrom the Dyson equation, we derive a scheme that allows to compute the many\nbody excitations of the superconductor and represents the extension to\nsuperconductivity of the G0W0 method in band structure theory. This\nsuperconducting G0 W0 method vastly improves the predicted spectra.\n", "  The two-dimensional one-component plasma ---2dOCP--- is a system composed by\n$n$ mobile particles with charge $q$ over a neutralizing background in a\ntwo-dimensional surface. The Boltzmann factor of this system, at temperature\n$T$, takes the form of a Vandermonde determinant to the power $\\Gamma =\nq^2/(2\\pi\\varepsilon k_BT)$, where $\\Gamma$ is the coupling constant of this\nCoulomb system. The partition function of the model has been computed exactly\nfor the even values of the coupling constant $\\Gamma$, and a finite number of\nparticles $n$, by two means: 1) by recognizing that the Boltzmann factor is the\nsquare of a Jack polynomial and expanding it in an appropriate monomial base,\nand 2) by mapping the system onto a 1-dimensional chain of interacting\nfermions. In this work the connection among the two methods is derived, and\nsome properties of the expansion coefficients for the power of the Vandermonde\ndeterminant are explored.\n", "  In this work, we present new soliton solutions for thick branes in $4+1$\ndimensions. In particular, we consider brane models based on the sine-Gordon\n($SG$), $\\varphi^{4}$ and $\\varphi^{6}$ scalar fields, which have broken\n$Z_{2}$ symmetry in some cases, and are responsible for supporting and\nstabilizing the thick branes. The origin of the symmetry breaking in these\nmodels resides in the fact that the modified scalar field potential may have\nnon-degenerate vacuua. These vacuua determine the cosmological constant on both\nsides of the brane. We also study the geodesic equations along the fifth\ndimension, in order to explore the particle motion in the neighbourhood of the\nbrane. Furthermore, we examine the stability of the thick branes, by\ndetermining the sign of the $w^2$ term in the expansion of the potential for\nthe resulting Schrodinger-like equation, where $w$ is the 5-dimensional\ncoordinate. It turns out that the $\\varphi^4$ brane is stable, while there are\nunstable modes for certain ranges of the model parameters in the SG and\n$\\varphi^6$ branes.\n", "  The quantum capacity of a memoryless channel is often used as a single figure\nof merit to characterize its ability to transmit quantum information\ncoherently. The capacity determines the maximal rate at which we can code\nreliably over asymptotically many uses of the channel. We argue that this\nasymptotic treatment is insufficient to the point of being irrelevant in the\nquantum setting where decoherence severely limits our ability to manipulate\nlarge quantum systems in the encoder and decoder. For all practical purposes we\nshould instead focus on the trade-off between three parameters: the rate of the\ncode, the number of coherent uses of the channel, and the fidelity of the\ntransmission. The aim is then to specify the region determined by allowed\ncombinations of these parameters. Towards this goal, we find approximate and\nexact characterizations of the region of allowed triplets for the qubit\ndephasing channel and for the erasure channel with classical post-processing\nassistance. In each case the region is parametrized by a second channel\nparameter, the quantum channel dispersion. In the process we also develop\nseveral general inner (achievable) and outer (converse) bounds on the coding\nregion that are valid for all finite-dimensional quantum channels and can be\ncomputed efficiently. Applied to the depolarizing channel, this allows us to\ndetermine a lower bound on the number of coherent uses of the channel necessary\nto witness super-additivity of the coherent information.\n", "  We show the existence of an inherent property of evanescent electromagnetic\nwaves: spin-momentum locking, where the direction of momentum fundamentally\nlocks the polarization of the wave. We trace the ultimate origin of this\nphenomenon to complex dispersion and causality requirements on evanescent\nwaves. We demonstrate that every case of evanescent waves in total internal\nreflection, surface states and optical fibers/waveguides possesses this\nintrinsic spin-momentum locking. We also introduce a universal right-handed\ntriplet consisting of momentum, decay and spin for evanescent waves. We derive\nthe Stokes parameters for evanescent waves which reveal an intriguing result -\nevery fast decaying evanescent wave is inherently circularly polarized with its\nhandedness tied to the direction of propagation. We also show the existence of\na fundamental angle associated with total internal reflection (TIR) such that\npropagating waves locally inherit perfect circular polarized characteristics\nfrom the evanescent wave. This circular TIR condition occurs if and only if the\nratio of permittivities of the two dielectric media exceeds the golden ratio.\nOur work leads to a unified understanding of this spin-momentum locking in\nvarious nanophotonic experiments and sheds light on the electromagnetic analogy\nwith the quantum spin hall state for electrons.\n", "  Much of the current experimental efforts for detecting Majorana zero modes\nhave been centered on probing the boundary of quantum wires with strong\nspin-orbit coupling. The same type of Majorana zero mode can also be realized\nat crystalline dislocations in 2D superconductors with the nontrivial weak\ntopological indices. Unlike at an Abrikosov vortex, at such a dislocation,\nthere are no other low-lying midgap states than the Majorana zero mode so that\nit avoids usual complications encountered in experimental detections such as\nscanning tunneling microscope (STM) measurements. We will show that, using the\nanisotropic dispersion of the $t_{2g}$ orbitals of Ti or Ta atoms, such a weak\ntopological superconductivity can be realized when the surface 2DEG of\nSrTiO$_3$ or KTaO$_3$ becomes superconducting, which can occur through either\nintrinsic pairing or proximity to existing s-wave superconductors.\n", "  Leptoquarks in the mass range of 500-1000 GeV can be resonantly produced in\nsignificant numbers by PeV neutrino interacting with nuclei at IceCube. We\ncompute the event rates of leptoquark production and decay events and use the\n3-year IceCube data for PeV energy events to find the allowed range of the\nleptoquarks mass and coupling parameter space. We use a low-scale quark lepton\nunification model based on the $SU(4)_C \\otimes SU(2)_L\\otimes U(1)_R$ gauge\ngroup where leptoquark couplings which give rise to proton decay are forbidden\nby the symmetry. We constrain the parameters of this model and point out\nsignals of leptoquarks in this model which may be seen in PeV energy IceCube\nevents in the future.\n", "  Hexagonal diamond has been predicted computationally to display extraordinary\nphysical properties including a hardness that exceeds cubic diamond. However, a\nrecent electron microscopy study has shown that so-called hexagonal diamond\nsamples are in fact not discrete materials but faulted and twinned cubic\ndiamond. We now provide a quantitative analysis of cubic and hexagonal stacking\nin diamond samples by analysing X-ray diffraction data with the DIFFaX software\npackage. The highest fractions of hexagonal stacking we find in materials which\nwere previously referred to as hexagonal diamond are below 60%. The remainder\nof the stacking sequences are cubic. We show that the cubic and hexagonal\nsequences are interlaced in a complex way and that naturally occurring\nLonsdaleite is not a simple phase mixture of cubic and hexagonal diamond.\nInstead, it is structurally best described as stacking disordered diamond. The\nfuture experimental challenge will be to prepare diamond samples beyond 60%\nhexagonality and towards the so far elusive 'perfect' hexagonal diamond.\n", "  It has recently been shown that the presence of a spectator pseudoscalar\nfield, coupled to photons through a Chern-Simons term, can amplify the\nprimordial tensor spectrum without observationally disrupting the primordial\nscalar spectrum. The amplification occurs due to an instability that develops\nfor the vector fields. We consider the extension of previous studies to account\nfor the contribution arising from an inhomogeneous vector background which is\ngenerated prior to the onset of inflation. We find that there may be\ncontributions in which net momentum is transferred between the inhomogeneous\nvector background and the gravitons, which would give rise to a signature\ndifferent than in the absence of the semiclassical corrections. We discuss the\nproperties the classical vector field form must have in order for these\nsignatures to leave observable imprints, though we were unable to construct a\nmodel for generating such a vector field.\n", "  We study the stability and the scattering properties of a spacetime with a\ntopological defect along a spherical bubble. This bubble connects two flat\nspacetimes which are asymptotically Minkowski, so that the resulting universe\nmay be regarded as containing a wormhole. Its distinguished feature is the\nabsence of exotic matter, i.e., its matter content respects all the energy\nconditions. Although this wormhole is nontraversable, waves and quantum\nparticles can tunnel between both universes. Interestingly enough, the wave\nequation alone does not uniquely determine the evolution of scalar waves on\nthis background, and the theory of self-adjoint extensions of symmetric\noperators is required to find the relevant boundary conditions in this context.\nHere we show that, for a particular boundary condition, this spacetime is\nstable and gives rise to a scattering pattern which is identical to the more\nusual thin-shell wormhole composed of exotic matter. Other boundary conditions\nof interest are also analyzed, including an unstable configuration with sharp\nresonances at well defined frequencies.\n", "  We present the open-source Python code pyMCZ that determines oxygen abundance\nand its distribution from strong emission lines in the standard metallicity\ncalibrators, based on the original IDL code of Kewley & Dopita (2002) with\nupdates from Kewley & Ellison (2008), and expanded to include more recently\ndeveloped calibrators. The standard strong-line diagnostics have been used to\nestimate the oxygen abundance in the interstellar medium through various\nemission line ratios in many areas of astrophysics, including galaxy evolution\nand supernova host galaxy studies. We introduce a Python implementation of\nthese methods that, through Monte Carlo sampling, better characterizes the\nstatistical oxygen abundance confidence region including the effect due to the\npropagation of observational uncertainties. These uncertainties are likely to\ndominate the error budget in the case of distant galaxies, hosts of cosmic\nexplosions. Given line flux measurements and their uncertainties, our code\nproduces synthetic distributions for the oxygen abundance in up to 15\nmetallicity calibrators simultaneously, as well as for E(B-V), and estimates\ntheir median values and their 68% confidence regions. We test our code on\nemission line measurements from a sample of nearby supernova host galaxies (z <\n0.15) and compare our metallicity results with those from previous methods. Our\nmetallicity estimates are consistent with previous methods but yield smaller\nstatistical uncertainties. Systematic uncertainties are not taken into account.\nWe offer visualization tools to assess the spread of the oxygen abundance in\nthe different calibrators, as well as the shape of the estimated oxygen\nabundance distribution in each calibrator, and develop robust metrics for\ndetermining the appropriate Monte Carlo sample size. The code is open access\nand open source and can be found at https://github.com/nyusngroup/pyMCZ\n(Abridged)\n", "  The motivation of this work is to get an additional insight into the\nirreversible energy dissipation on the quantum level. The presented examination\nprocedure is based on the Feynman path integral method that is applied and\nwidened towards the calculation of the kernel of a quantum mechanical damped\noscillator. Here, it is shown that the energy loss of the oscillator can be\ngenerated by the introduced harmonic complex potential. The related damped wave\nfunction, however, does not pertain to the probability meaning as it is usual\nin the case of complex absorbing potentials. This decrease of the wave function\nis evaluated, moreover, the energy dissipation and the measure the\nirreversibility are expressed.\n", "  dc and ac magnetic properties of two thin-walled superconducting Nb cylinders\nwith a rectangular cross-section are reported. Magnetization curves and the ac\nresponse were studied on as-prepared and patterned samples in magnetic fields\nparallel to the cylinder axis. A row of micron-sized antidots (holes) was made\nin the film along the cylinder axis. Avalanche-like jumps of the magnetization\nare observed for both samples at low temperatures for magnetic fields not only\nabove $H_{c1}$, but in fields lower than $H_{c1}$ in the vortex-free region.\nThe positions of the jumps are not reproducible and they change from one\nexperiment to another, resembling vortex lattice instabilities usually observed\nfor magnetic fields larger than $H_{c1}$. At temperatures above $0.66T_c$ and\n$0.78T_c$ the magnetization curves become smooth for the patterned and the\nas-prepared samples, respectively. The magnetization curve of a reference\nplanar Nb film in the parallel field geometry does not exhibit jumps in the\nentire range of accessible temperatures. The ac response was measured in\nconstant and swept dc magnetic field modes. Experiment shows that ac losses at\nlow magnetic fields in a swept field mode are smaller for the patterned sample.\nFor both samples the shapes of the field dependences of losses and the\namplitude of the third harmonic are the same in constant and swept field near\n$H_{c3}$. This similarity does not exist at low fields in a swept mode.\n", "  The multisymplectic formalism of field theories developed by many\nmathematicians over the last fifty years is extended in this work to deal with\nmanifolds that have boundaries. In particular, we develop a multisymplectic\nframework for first order covariant Hamiltonian field theories on manifolds\nwith boundaries. This work is a geometric fulfillment of Fock's\ncharacterization of field theories as it appears in recent work by Cattaneo,\nMnev and Reshetikhin [Ca14]. This framework leads to a true geometric\nunderstanding of conventional choices for boundary conditions. For example, the\nboundary condition that the pull-back of the 1-form on the cotangent space of\nfields at the boundary vanish, i.e. \\pi * \\alpha = 0 , is shown to be a\nconsequence of our finding that the boundary fields of the theory lie in the\n0-level set of the moment map of the gauge group of the theory.\n  It is also shown that the natural way to interpret Euler-Lagrange equations\nas an evolution system near the boundary is as a presymplectic system in an\nextended phase space containing the natural configuration and momenta fields at\nthe boundary together with extra degrees of freedom corresponding to the\ntransversal components at the boundary of the momenta fields of the theory. The\nconsistency conditions at the boundary are analyzed and the reduced phase space\nof the system is determined to be a symplectic manifold with a distinguished\nisotropic submanifold corresponding to the boundary data of the solutions of\nEuler-Lagrange equations. This setting makes it possible to define well-posed\nboundary conditions, and provides the adequate setting for the canonical\nquantization of the system.\n  The notions of the theory will be tested against three significant examples:\nscalar fields, Poisson\\sigma-model and Yang-Mills theories.\n", "  Under the assumption that the superconducting state belongs to a single\nirreducible representation of lattice symmetry, we argue that the pairing\nsymmetry in all measured iron-based superconductors is universally consistent\nwith the A_{1g} s-wave. The robust s-wave pairing throughout the different\nfamilies of iron-based superconductors at different doping regions signals two\nfundamental principles behind high T_c superconducting mechanisms: (1) the\ncorrespondence principle: the short range magnetic exchange interactions and\nthe Fermi surfaces act collaboratively to achieve high T_c superconductivity\nand determine pairing symmetries; (2) the magnetic selection pairing rule: the\nsuperconductivity is only induced by the magnetic exchange couplings from the\nsuperexchange mechanism through cation-anion-cation chemical bondings. These\nprinciples explain why the unconventional high T_c superconductivity appears to\nbe such a rare but robust phenomena with its strict requirement on electronic\nenvironment. The robust s-wave pairing also reveals that the current standard\neffective models with only onsite interactions are not sufficient and a minimum\nmicroscopic model must include strong nearest neighbor repulsive interactions\nresulted from the d-d direct bondings to serves as a s-wave symmetry\nstabilizer. Finally, the sign distribution of the superconducting order\nparameters in the reciprocal space is simply a consequence of the form factors\ngiven by the leading short-range pairings. The sign change of superconducting\norder parameters on Fermi surfaces is not a necessary requirement in\nrepulsive-interaction-driven high T_c mechanism. The results will guide us to\nsearch for new electronic structure that supports high T_c superconductivity.\n", "  The ionization of xenon atoms subjected to 42fs, 800nm pulses of radiation\nfrom a Ti:Sapphire laser was investigated. In our experiments a maximum laser\nintensity of $\\sim2\\times 10^{15} \\textrm{W}/\\textrm{cm}^2$ was used. Xenon\nions were measured using a time-of-flight ion mass spectrometer having an\nentrance slit with dimensions of $12\\mu \\textrm{m} \\times 400\\mu \\textrm{m}$.\nThe observed yields $\\textrm{Xe}^{n+} (n=1-7)$ were partially free of spatial\naveraging. The ion yields showed sequential and nonsequential multiple\nionization and dip structures following saturation. To investigate the dip\nstructures and to perform a comparison between experimental and simulated data,\nwith the goal of clarifying the effects of residual spatial averaging, we\nderived a hybrid analytical-numerical solution for the integration kernel in\nrestricted focal geometries. We simulated xenon ionization using\nAmmosov-Delone-Krainov and Perelomov-Popov-Terent'ev theories and obtained\nagreement with the results of observations. Since a large number of experiments\nsuffer from spatial averaging, the results presented are important to correctly\ninterpret experimental data by taking into account spatial averaging.\n", "  We report on the direct measurement in real space of the effect of the van\nder Waals forces between individual Rydberg atoms on their external degrees of\nfreedom. Clusters of Rydberg atoms with inter-particle distances of around 5\n{\\mu}m are created by first generating a small number of seed excitations in a\nmagneto-optical trap, followed by off-resonant excitation that leads to a chain\nof facilitated excitation events. After a variable expansion time the Rydberg\natoms are field ionized, and from the arrival time distributions the size of\nthe Rydberg cluster after expansion is calculated. Our experimental results\nagree well with a numerical simulation of the van der Waals explosion.\n", "  Geometric frustrations and quantum mechanical fluctuations may prohibit the\nformation of long-range ordering even at the lowest temperature, and therefore\nliquid-like ground states could be expected. A good example is the quantum spin\nliquid in frustrated magnets that represents an exotic phase of matter and is\nattracting enormous interests. Geometric frustrations and quantum fluctuations\ncan happen beyond magnetic systems. Here we propose that quantum\nelectric-dipole liquids, analogs to quantum spin liquids, could emerge in\nfrustrated dielectrics where antiferroelectrically coupled small electric\ndipoles reside on a triangular lattice. The quantum paraelectric hexaferrite\nBaFe12O19, in which small electric dipoles originated from the off-center\ndisplacement of Fe3+ in the FeO5 bipyramids constitute a two-dimensional\ntriangular lattice, represents a promising candidate to generate the\nanticipated electric-dipole liquid. We present a series of experimental\nevidences, including dielectric permittivity, heat capacity, and thermal\nconductivity measured down to 66 mK, to reveal the existence of a nontrivial\nground state in BaFe12O19, characterized by itinerant low-energy excitations\nwith a small gap, to which we interpret as an exotic liquid-like quantum phase.\nThe quantum electric-dipole liquids in frustrated dielectrics open up a fresh\nplayground for fundamental physics and may find applications in quantum\ninformation and computation as well.\n", "  We study the background cosmological dynamics with a three component source\ncontent: a radiation fluid, a barotropic fluid to mimic the matter sector and a\nsingle scalar field which can act as dark energy giving rise to the late-time\naccelerated phase. Using the well-known dimensionless variables, we cast the\ndynamical equations into an autonomous system of ordinary differential\nequations (ASODE), which are studied by computing the fixed points and the\nconditions for their stability. The matter fluid and the scalar field are taken\nto be uncoupled at first and later, we consider a coupling between the two of\nthe form $Q = \\sqrt{2/3}\\kappa\\beta\\rho_m\\dot{\\phi}$ where $\\rho_m$ is the\nbarotropic fluid density. The key point of our analysis is that for the closure\nof ASODE, we only demand that the jerk, $\\Gamma = V V\"/V'^2$ is a function of\nacceleration, $z = - M_p V'/ V$, that is, $\\Gamma = 1+ f(z)$. In this way, we\nare able to accommodate a large class of potentials that goes beyond the simple\nexponential potentials. The analysis is completely generic and\n\\emph{independent} of the form of the potential for the scalar field. As an\nillustration and confirmation of the analysis, we consider $f(z)$ of the forms\n$\\mu/z^2$, $\\mu/z$, $(\\mu-z)/z^2$ and $(\\mu-z)$ to numerically compute the\nevolution of cosmological parameters with and without coupling. Implications of\nthe approach and the results are discussed.\n", "  We investigate the effects of topological order on the transition\ntemperature, $T_c$, and response functions in fermionic superfluids with Rashba\nspin-orbit coupling and a transverse Zeeman field in three dimensions. Our\ncalculations, relevant to the ultracold atomic Fermi gases, include\nfluctuations beyond mean-field theory and are compatible with $f$-sum rules.\nReminiscent of the $p_x + i p_y$ superfluid, the topological phase is\nstabilized when driven away from the Bose-Einstein condensation and towards the\nBCS limit. Accordingly, while experimentally accessible, $T_c$ is significantly\nsuppressed in a topological superfluid. Above $T_c$, the spin and density\nresponse functions provide signatures of topological phases via the\nrecombination or amplification of frequency dependent peaks.\n", "  The reversible phase transition from hydrochloric-acid-doped ice VI to its\nhydrogen-ordered counterpart ice XV is followed using differential scanning\ncalorimetry. Upon cooling at ambient pressure fast hydrogen ordering is\nobserved at first followed by a slower process which manifests as a tail to the\ninitial sharp exotherm. The residual hydrogen disorder in H2O and D2O ice XV is\ndetermined as a function of the cooling rate. We conclude that it will be\ndifficult to obtain fully hydrogen-ordered ice XV by cooling at ambient\npressure. Our new experimental findings are discussed in the context of recent\ncomputational work on ice XV.\n", "  We prove the existence of (one-way) communication tasks with a subconstant\nversus superconstant asymptotic gap, which we call \"doubly infinite,\" between\ntheir quantum information and communication complexities. We do so by studying\nthe exclusion game [C. Perry et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 115, 030504 (2015)] for\nwhich there exist instances where the quantum information complexity tends to\nzero as the size of the input $n$ increases. By showing that the quantum\ncommunication complexity of these games scales at least logarithmically in $n$,\nwe obtain our result. We further show that the established lower bounds and\ngaps still hold even if we allow a small probability of error. However in this\ncase, the $n$-qubit quantum message of the zero-error strategy can be\ncompressed polynomially.\n", "  We derive the part of the Lagrangian for the sigma model on the eta-deformed\nAdS_5 x S^5 space which is quadratic in fermions and has the full dependence on\nbosons. We then show that there exists a field redefinition which brings the\ncorresponding Lagrangian to the standard form of type IIB Green-Schwarz\nsuperstring. Reading off the corresponding RR couplings, we observe that they\nfail to satisfy the supergravity equations of motion, despite the presence of\nkappa-symmetry. However, in a special scaling limit our solution reproduces the\nsupergravity background found by Maldacena and Russo. Further, using the\nfermionic Lagrangian, we compute a number of new matrix elements of the tree\nlevel world-sheet scattering matrix. We then show that after a unitary\ntransformation on the basis of two-particle states which is not one-particle\nfactorisable, the corresponding T-matrix factorises into two equivalent parts.\nEach part satisfies the classical Yang-Baxter equation and coincides with the\nlarge tension limit of the q-deformed S-matrix.\n", "  The newly developed two-dimensional layered materials provide perfect\nplatform for valley-spintronics exploration. To determine the prospect of\nutilizing the valley degree of freedom, it is of great importance to directly\ndetect and understand the valley dynamics in these materials. Here, the exciton\nvalley dynamics in monolayer WSe$_2$ is investigated by the two-color\npump-probe magneto-optical Kerr technique. By tuning the probe photon energy in\nresonance with the free excitons and trions, the valley relaxation time of\ndifferent excitonic states in monolayer WSe$_2$ is determined. Valley\nrelaxation time of the free exciton in monolayer WSe$_2$ is confirmed to be\nseveral picoseconds. A slow valley polarization relaxation process is observed\nto be associated with the trions, showing that the valley lifetime for trions\nis one order of magnitude longer than that of free excitons. This finding\nsuggests that trion can be a good candidate for valleytronics application.\n", "  We study the effect of turnover of cross linkers, motors and filaments on the\ngeneration of a contractile stress in a network of filaments connected by\npassive crosslinkers and subjected to the forces exerted by molecular motors.\nWe perform numerical simulations where filaments are treated as rigid rods and\nmolecular motors move fast compared to the timescale of exchange of\ncrosslinkers. We show that molecular motors create a contractile stress above a\ncritical number of crosslinkers. When passive crosslinkers are allowed to turn\nover, the stress exerted by the network vanishes, due to the formation of\nclusters. When both filaments and passive crosslinkers turn over, clustering is\nprevented and the network reaches a dynamic contractile steady-state. A maximum\nstress is reached for an optimum ratio of the filament and crosslinker turnover\nrates.\n", "  We study the heavy-light mesons in a relativistic model, which is derived\nfrom the instantaneous Bethe-Salpeter equation by applying the Foldy-Wouthuysen\ntransformation on the heavy quark. The kernel we choose is based on scalar\nconfining and vector Coulomb potentials, the transverse interaction of the\ngluon exchange is also taken into account in this model. The spectra and wave\nfunctions of $D$, $D_s$, $B$, $B_s$ meson states are obtained. The spectra are\ncalculated up to the order of $1/m_Q$, and wave functions are treated to\nleading order.\n", "  We consider a position-dependent coined quantum walk on $\\mathbb{Z}$ and\nassume that the coin operator $C(x)$ satisfies \\[ \\|C(x) - C_0 \\| \\leq\nc_1|x|^{-1-\\epsilon},\n  \\quad x \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\] with positive $c_1$ and $\\epsilon$ and $C_0 \\in\nU(2)$. We show that the Heisenberg operator $\\hat x(t)$ of the position\noperator converges to the asymptotic velocity operator $\\hat v_+$ so that \\[\n\\mbox{s-}\\lim_{t \\to \\infty} {\\rm exp}\\left( i \\xi \\frac{\\hat x(t)}{t} \\right)\n  = \\Pi_{\\rm p}(U) + {\\rm exp}(i \\xi \\hat v_+) \\Pi_{\\rm ac}(U) \\] provided that\n$U$ has no singular continuous spectrum. Here $\\Pi_{\\rm p}(U)$ (resp. $\\Pi_{\\rm\nac}(U)$) is the orthogonal projection onto the direct sum of all eigenspaces\n(resp. the subspace of absolute continuity) of $U$. We also prove that for the\nrandom variable $X_t$ denoting the position of a quantum walker at time $t \\in\n\\mathbb{N}$, $X_t/t$ converges in law to a random variable $V$ with the\nprobability distribution \\[ \\mu_V = \\|\\Pi_{\\rm p}(U)\\Psi_0\\|^2\\delta_0\n  + \\|E_{\\hat v_+}(\\cdot) \\Pi_{\\rm ac}(U)\\Psi_0\\|^2, \\] where $\\Psi_0$ is the\ninitial state, $\\delta_0$ the Dirac measure at zero, and $E_{\\hat v_+}$ the\nspectral measure of $\\hat v_+$.\n", "  We present a new method for determining the local dark matter density using\nkinematic data for a population of tracer stars. The Jeans equation in the\n$z$-direction is integrated to yield an equation that gives the velocity\ndispersion as a function of the total mass density, tracer density, and the\ntilt term that describes the coupling of vertical and radial motions. We then\nfit a dark matter mass profile to tracer density and velocity dispersion data\nto derive credible regions on the vertical dark matter density profile. Our\nmethod avoids numerical differentiation, leading to lower numerical noise, and\nis able to deal with the tilt term while remaining one dimensional. In this\nstudy we present the method and perform initial tests on idealised mock data.\nWe also demonstrate the importance of dealing with the tilt term for tracers\nthat sample $\\gtrsim 1$ kpc above the disc plane. If ignored, this results in a\nsystematic underestimation of the dark matter density.\n", "  Reliable quantum information processing in the face of errors is a major\nfundamental and technological challenge. Quantum error correction protects\nquantum states by encoding a logical quantum bit (qubit) in multiple physical\nqubits. To be compatible with universal fault-tolerant computations, it is\nessential that the states remain encoded at all times and that errors are\nactively corrected. Here we demonstrate such active error correction on a\ncontinuously protected qubit using a diamond quantum processor. We encode a\nlogical qubit in three long-lived nuclear spins, repeatedly detect phase errors\nby non-destructive measurements using an ancilla electron spin, and apply\ncorrections on the encoded state by real-time feedback. The actively\nerror-corrected qubit is robust against errors and multiple rounds of error\ncorrection prevent errors from accumulating. Moreover, by correcting correlated\nphase errors naturally induced by the environment, we demonstrate that encoded\nquantum superposition states are preserved beyond the dephasing time of the\nbest physical qubit used in the encoding. These results establish a powerful\nplatform for the fundamental investigation of error correction under different\ntypes of noise and mark an important step towards fault-tolerant quantum\ninformation processing.\n", "  Light traveling in time-dependent media has many extraordinary properties\nwhich can be utilized to convert frequency, achieve temporal cloaking, and\nsimulate cosmological phenomena. In this paper, we focus on time-dependent\naxion-type magnetoelectric (ME) media, and prove that light in these media\nalways has two degenerate modes with opposite circular polarizations\ncorresponding to one wave vector $\\mathbf{k}$, and name this effect \"time\ncircular birefringence\" (TCB). By interchanging the status of space and time,\nthe pair of TCB modes can appear simultaneously via \"time refraction\" and \"time\nreflection\" of a linear polarized incident wave at a time interface of ME\nmedia. The superposition of the two TCB modes causes the \"time Faraday effect\",\nnamely the globally unified polarization axes rotate with time. A circularly\npolarized Gaussian pulse traversing a time interface is also studied. If the\nwave-vector spectrum of a pulse mainly concentrates in the non-traveling-wave\nband, the pulse will be trapped with nearly fixed center while its intensity\nwill grow rapidly. In addition, we propose an experimental scheme of using\nmolecular fluid with external time-varying electric and magnetic fields both\nparallel to the direction of light to realize these phenomena in practice.\n", "  Resonant excitation of atoms and ions in macroscopic cavities has lead to\nexceptional control over quanta of light. Translating these advantages into the\nsolid state with emitters in microcavities promises revolutionary quantum\ntechnologies in information processing and metrology. Key is resonant optical\nreading and writing from the emitter-cavity system. However, it has been widely\nexpected that the reflection of a resonant laser from a micro-fabricated\nwavelength-sized cavity would dominate any quantum signal. Here we demonstrate\ncoherent photon scattering from a quantum dot in a micro-pillar. The cavity is\nshown to enhance the fraction of light which is resonantly scattered towards\nunity, generating anti-bunched indistinguishable photons a factor of 16 beyond\nthe time-bandwidth limit, even when the transition is near saturation. Finally,\ndeterministic excitation is used to create 2-photon N00N states with which we\nmake super-resolving phase measurements in a photonic circuit.\n", "  We consider Horava gravity within the framework of the effective field theory\n(EFT) of dark energy and modified gravity. We work out a complete mapping of\nthe theory into the EFT language for an action including all the operators\nwhich are relevant for linear perturbations with up to sixth order spatial\nderivatives. We then employ an updated version of the EFTCAMB/EFTCosmoMC\npackage to study the cosmology of the low-energy limit of Horava gravity and\nplace constraints on its parameters using several cosmological data sets. In\nparticular we use cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature-temperature and\nlensing power spectra by Planck 2013, WMAP low-l polarization spectra, WiggleZ\ngalaxy power spectrum, local Hubble measurements, Supernovae data from SNLS,\nSDSS and HST and the baryon acoustic oscillations measurements from BOSS, SDSS\nand 6dFGS. We get improved upper bounds, with respect to those from Big Bang\nNucleosynthesis, on the deviation of the cosmological gravitational constant\nfrom the local Newtonian one. At the level of the background phenomenology, we\nfind a relevant rescaling of the Hubble rate at all epoch, which has a strong\nimpact on the cosmological observables; at the level of perturbations, we\ndiscuss in details all the relevant effects on the observables and find that in\ngeneral the quasi-static approximation is not safe to describe the evolution of\nperturbations. Overall we find that the effects of the modifications induced by\nthe low-energy Horava gravity action are quite dramatic and current data place\ntight bounds on the theory parameters.\n", "  Quantum amplification is essential for various quantum technologies such as\ncommunication and weak-signal detection. However, its practical use is still\nlimited due to inevitable device fragility that brings about distortion in the\noutput signal or state. This paper presents a general theory that solves this\ncritical issue. The key idea is simple and easy to implement: just a passive\nfeedback of the amplifier's auxiliary mode, which is usually thrown away. In\nfact, this scheme makes the controlled amplifier significantly robust, and\nfurthermore it realizes the minimum-noise amplification even under realistic\nimperfections. Hence, the presented theory enables the quantum amplification to\nbe implemented at a practical level. Also, a nondegenerate parametric amplifier\nsubjected to a special detuning is proposed to show that, additionally, it has\na broadband nature.\n", "  Many-body systems relaxing to equilibrium can exhibit complex dynamics even\nif their steady state is trivial. At low temperatures or high densities their\nevolution is often dominated by steric hindrances affecting particle motion\n[1,2,3]. Local rearrangements are highly constrained, giving rise to collective\n- and often slow - relaxation.This dynamics can be difficult to analyse from\nfirst principles, but the essential physical ingredients are captured by\nidealized lattice models with so- called kinetic constraints [4]. Here we\nexperimentally realize a many-body system exhibiting manifest kinetic\nconstraints and measure its dynamical properties. In the cold Rydberg gas used\nin our experiments, the nature of the constraints can be tailored through the\ndetuning of the excitation lasers from resonance [5,6,7,8], which controls\nwhether the system undergoes correlated or anti- correlated dynamics. Our\nresults confirm recent theoretical predictions [5,6], and highlight the analogy\nbetween the dynamics of interacting Rydberg gases and that of soft-matter\nsystems.\n", "  Confocal microscopy of colloids combined with digital image processing has\nbecome a powerful tool in soft matter physics and materials science. Together,\nthese techniques enable locating and tracking of more than half a million\nindividual colloidal particles at once. However, despite improvements in\nlocating algorithms that improve position accuracy, it remains challenging to\nlocate all particles in a densely-packed, three dimensional colloid without\nerroneously identifying the same particle more than once. We present a simple,\niterative algorithm that mitigates both the \"missed particle\" and \"double\ncounting\" problems while simultaneously reducing sensitivity to the specific\nchoice of input parameters. It is also useful for analyzing images with\nspatially-varying brightness in which a single set of input parameters is not\nappropriate for all particles. The algorithm is easy to implement and\ncompatible with existing particle locating software.\n", "  We report Ramsey interference in the excitonic population of a negatively\ncharged quantum dot revealing the coherence of the state in the limit where\nradiative decay is dominant. Our experiments show that the decay time of the\nRamsey interference is limited by the spectral width of the transition.\nApplying a vertical magnetic field induces Zeeman split transitions that can be\naddressed by changing the laser detuning to reveal 2, 3 and 4 level system\nbehaviour. We show that under finite field the phase-sensitive control of two\noptical pulses from a single laser can be used to prepare both population and\nspin qubits simultaneously.\n", "  We develop the functional renormalization group formalism for a tensorial\ngroup field theory with closure constraint, in the case of an Abelian just\nrenormalizable model with quartic interactions. The method allows us to obtain\na closed but non-autonomous system of differential equations which describe the\nrenormalization group flow of the couplings beyond perturbation theory. The\nexplicit dependence of the beta functions on the running scale is due to the\nexistence of an external scale in the model, the radius of the unit circle. We\nstudy the occurrence of fixed points and their critical properties in two\ndifferent approximate regimes, corresponding to the deep UV and deep IR.\nBesides confirming the asymptotic freedom of the model, we find also a\nnon-trivial fixed point, with one relevant direction. Our results are\nqualitatively similar to those found previously for a rank-3 model without\nclosure constraint, and it is thus tempting to speculate that the presence of a\nWilson-Fisher-like fixed point is a general feature of asymptotically free\ntensorial group field theories.\n", "  We model the luminosity-dependent projected and redshift-space two-point\ncorrelation functions (2PCFs) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) DR7 Main\ngalaxy sample, using the halo occupation distribution (HOD) model and the\nsubhalo abundance matching (SHAM) model and its extension. All the models are\nbuilt on the same high-resolution $N$-body simulations. We find that the HOD\nmodel generally provides the best performance in reproducing the clustering\nmeasurements in both projected and redshift spaces. The SHAM model with the\nsame halo-galaxy relation for central and satellite galaxies (or distinct\nhaloes and subhaloes), when including scatters, has a best-fitting\n$\\chi^2/\\rm{dof}$ around $2$--$3$. We therefore extend the SHAM model to the\nsubhalo clustering and abundance matching (SCAM) by allowing the central and\nsatellite galaxies to have different galaxy--halo relations. We infer the\ncorresponding halo/subhalo parameters by jointly fitting the galaxy 2PCFs and\nabundances and consider subhaloes selected based on three properties, the mass\n$M_{\\rm acc}$ at the time of accretion, the maximum circular velocity $V_{\\rm\nacc}$ at the time of accretion, and the peak maximum circular velocity $V_{\\rm\npeak}$ over the history of the subhaloes. The three subhalo models work well\nfor luminous galaxy samples (with luminosity above $L_*$). For low-luminosity\nsamples, the $V_{\\rm acc}$ model stands out in reproducing the data, with the\n$V_{\\rm peak}$ model slightly worse, while the $M_{\\rm acc}$ model fails to fit\nthe data. We discuss the implications of the modeling results.\n", "  We have investigated spin reorientation phenomena and interaction driven\neffects under the presence of applied strains on the (001) surface of\nPb$_{1-x}$Sn$_x$(Te, Se) topological crystalline insulators, which host\nmultiple Dirac cones. Our analysis is based on a four-band $k\\cdot p$ model,\nwhich captures the spin and orbital textures of the surface states at low\nenergies around the $\\bar{X}$ and $\\bar{Y}$ points, including the Lifshitz\ntransition. Even without breaking the time-reversal symmetry, we find that\ncertain strains which break the mirror symmetry can induce hedgehog-like spin\ntexture associated with gap formation at the Dirac points. The Chern number of\nthe gapped surface ground state is shown to be tunable through the interplay of\nstrains and a perpendicular Zeeman field. We also consider effects of strain in\nthe presence of interactions in driving competing orders, and obtain the\nassociated phase diagram at the mean-field level. Potential applications of our\nresults for low power consuming electronics are discussed.\n", "  We consider an abstract quantum walk defined by a unitary evolution operator\n$U$, which acts on a Hilbert space decomposed into a direct sum of Hilbert\nspaces $\\{\\mathcal{H}_v \\}_{v \\in V}$. We show that such $U$ naturally defines\na directed graph $G_U$ and the probability of finding a quantum walker on\n$G_U$. The asymptotic property of an abstract quantum walker is governed by the\ngenerator $H$ of $U$ such that $U^n = e^{inH}$. We derive the generator of an\nevolution of the form $U = S(2d_A^* d_A -1)$, a generalization of the Szegedy\nevolution operator. Here $d_A$ is a boundary operator and $S$ a shift operator.\n", "  The spin Hall effect creates a spin current in response to a charge current\nin a material that has strong spin-orbit coupling. The size of the spin Hall\neffect in many materials is disputed, requiring independent measurements of the\neffect. We develop a novel mechanical method to measure the size of the spin\nHall effect, relying on the equivalence between spin and angular momentum. The\nspin current carries angular momentum, so the flow of angular momentum will\nresult in a mechanical torque on the material. We determine the size and\ngeometry of this torque and demonstrate that it can be measured using a\nnanomechanical device. Our results show that measurement of the spin Hall\neffect in this manner is possible and also opens possibilities for actuating\nnanomechanical systems with spin currents.\n", "  We show that the interplay of a high density two-dimensional electron gas and\nlocalized electrons in a neighboring Mott insulator leads to kinetic magnetism\nunique to the Mott/band insulator interface. Our study is based upon a bilayer\nHubbard model at $U=\\infty$ with a potential difference between the two layers.\nWe combine analytic results with DMRG simulations to show that magnetism, and\nespecially ferromagnetism, is greatly enhanced relative by the proximity of the\ntwo subsystems. The results are potentially relevant to recent experiments\nsuggesting magnetism in $R$TiO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ heterostructures.\n", "  Rainfall in coastal areas of the tropics is often shaped by the presence of\ncirculations directly associated with the topography, such as land-sea and/or\nmountain-valley breezes. In many regions the coastally-affected rainfall\nconsitutes more than half of the overall rainfall received. Weather and climate\nmodels with parametrized convection produce large errors in rainfall in\ntropical coastal regions, most commonly underestimating rainfall over land and\noverestimating it over the ocean. Building on an algorithm to objectively\nidentify rainfall that is associated with land-sea interaction we investigate\nwhether the relationship between rainfall in coastal regions and the\nlarge-scale atmosphere differs from that over the open ocean or over inland\nareas. We combine 3-hourly satellite estimates of rainfall with estimates of\nthe large-scale atmospheric state from reanalyses. We find that when grouped by\nrainfall intensity, medium-intensity coastal rainfall in the tropics occurs in\nmore stable conditions and drier atmospheres and is associated with less\nlarge-scale convergence than its open-ocean and inland counterparts. Overall,\nthe dependence of the amount of rainfall on the large-scale state is\nsignificantly weaker when the rainfall is coastally influenced. Our findings\nindicate that the representation of convection in weather and climate models\nmust cater for the special character of the large-to-small scale relationship\nnear coasts rather than rely on a common set of rules across the globe.\n", "  In higher organisms, all cells share the same genome, but every cell\nexpresses only a limited and specific set of genes that defines the cell type.\nDuring cell division, not only the genome, but also the cell type is inherited\nby the daughter cells. This intriguing phenomenon is achieved by a variety of\nprocesses that have been collectively termed epigenetics: the stable and\ninheritable changes in gene expression patterns. This article reviews the\nextremely rich and exquisitely multi-scale physical mechanisms that govern the\nbiological processes behind the initiation, spreading and inheritance of\nepigenetic states. These include not only the changes in the molecular\nproperties associated with the chemical modifications of DNA and histone\nproteins, such as methylation and acetylation, but also less conventional ones,\nsuch as the physics that governs the three-dimensional organization of the\ngenome in cell nuclei. Strikingly, to achieve stability and heritability of\nepigenetic states, cells take advantage of many different physical principles,\nsuch as the universal behavior of polymers and copolymers, the general features\nof non-equilibrium dynamical systems, and the electrostatic and mechanical\nproperties related to chemical modifications of DNA and histones. By putting\nthe complex biological literature under this new light, the emerging picture is\nthat a limited set of general physical rules play a key role in initiating,\nshaping and transmitting this crucial \"epigenetic landscape\". This new\nperspective not only allows to rationalize the normal cellular functions, but\nalso helps to understand the emergence of pathological states, in which the\nepigenetic landscape becomes dysfunctional.\n", "  The $(1+1)$-dimensional Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) universe filled with\na perfect fluid with equation of state $p=\\omega \\rho$ is analyzed through the\nview of Ho\\v rava-Lifshitz (HL) theory of gravity. In this theory, the\nanisotropic scaling of space and time breaks Lorentz invariance of General\nRelativity (GR) in such a way that the gravitational action is no longer a\ntopological invariant and the theory becomes dynamical. With the introduction\nof a perfect fluid through Schutz formalism, it is shown that the resulting\ndynamical theory is very similar to the two-dimensional Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT)\nmodel, where a dilatonic degree of freedom is introduced to force a dynamical\ntheory. However, in HL theory, the introduction of a dilaton field is not\nnecessary.\n", "  We study deuterium fractionation in two massive starless/early-stage cores\nC1-N and C1-S in Infrared Dark Cloud (IRDC) G028.37+00.07, first identified by\nTan et al. (2013) with ALMA. Line emission from multiple transitions of $\\rm\nN_2H^+$ and $\\rm N_2D^+$ were observed with the ALMA, CARMA, SMA, JCMT, NRO 45m\nand IRAM 30m telescopes. By simultaneously fitting the spectra, we estimate the\nexcitation conditions and deuterium fraction, $D_{\\rm frac}^{\\rm N_2H^+} \\equiv\n[\\rm N_2D^+]/[N_2H^+]$, with values of $D_{\\rm frac}^{\\rm N_2H^+} \\simeq\n0.2$--$0.7$, several orders of magnitude above the cosmic [D]/[H] ratio.\nAdditional observations of o-H$_2$D$^+$ are also presented that help constrain\nthe ortho-to-para ratio of $\\rm H_2$, which is a key quantity affecting the\ndegree of deuteration. We then present chemodynamical modeling of the two\ncores, exploring especially the implications for the collapse rate relative to\nfree-fall, $\\alpha_{\\rm ff}$. In order to reach the high level of observed\ndeuteration of $\\rm N_2H^+$, we find that the most likely evolutionary history\nof the cores involves collapse at a relatively slow rate, $\\lesssim1/10$th of\nfree-fall.\n", "  Recently, a new type of quantum key distribution, called the round-robin\ndifferential phase-shift (RRDPS) protocol [Nature 509, 475 (2014)], was\nproposed, where the security can be guaranteed without monitoring any\nstatistics. In this Letter, we investigate source imperfections and\nside-channel attacks on the source of this protocol. We show that only three\nassumptions are needed for the security, and no detailed characterizations of\nthe source or the side-channel attacks are needed. This high robustness is\nanother striking advantage of the RRDPS protocol over other protocols.\n", "  Variational principles for magnetohydrodynamics were introduced by previous\nauthors both in Lagrangian and Eulerian form. In this paper we introduce\nsimpler Eulerian variational principles from which all the relevant equations\nof non-barotropic magnetohydrodynamics can be derived. The variational\nprinciple is given in terms of five independent functions for non-stationary\nbarotropic flows. This is less then the eight variables which appear in the\nstandard equations of barotropic magnetohydrodynamics which are the magnetic\nfield $\\vec B$ the velocity field $\\vec v$, the entropy $s$ and the density\n$\\rho$.\n", "  We study statistics of the gaps in Random Average Process (RAP) on a ring\nwith particles hopping symmetrically, except one tracer particle which could be\ndriven. These particles hop either to the left or to the right by a random\nfraction $\\eta$ of the space available till next particle in the respective\ndirections. The random fraction $\\eta \\in [0,~1)$ is chosen from a distribution\n$R(\\eta)$. For non-driven tracer, when $R(\\eta)$ satisfies a necessary and\nsufficient condition, the stationary joint distribution of the gaps between\nsuccessive particles takes an universal form that is factorized except for a\nglobal constraint. Some interesting explicit forms of $R(\\eta)$ are found which\nsatisfy this condition. In case of driven tracer, the system reaches a\ncurrent-carrying steady state where such factorization does not hold.\nAnalytical progress has been made in the thermodynamic limit, where we computed\nthe single site mass distribution inside the bulk. We have also computed the\ntwo point gap-gap correlation exactly in that limit. Numerical simulations\nsupport our analytical results.\n", "  The time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) provides a unified\ndescription of the structure and reaction. The linear approximation leads to\nthe random-phase approximation (RPA) which is capable of describing a variety\nof collective motion in a harmonic regime. Beyond the linear regime, we present\napplications of the TDDFT to nuclear fusion and fission reaction. In\nparticular, the extraction of the internuclear potential and the inertial mass\nparameter is performed using two different methods. A fusion hindrance\nmechanism for heavy systems is investigated from the microscopic point of view.\nThe canonical collective variables are determined by the adiabatic\nself-consistent collective coordinate method. Preliminary results of the\nspontaneous fission path, the potential, and the collective mass parameter are\nshown for 8Be --> alpha+alpha.\n", "  A numerical method, suitable for the simulation of the time evolution of\nquantum spin models of arbitrary lattice dimension, is presented. The method\ncombines sampling of the Wigner function with evolution equations obtained from\nthe Bogoliubov-Born-Green-Kirkwood-Yvon (BBGKY) hierarchy. Going to higher\norders of the BBGKY hierarchy allows for a systematic refinement of the method.\nQuantum correlations are treated through both, the Wigner function sampling and\nthe BBGKY evolution, bringing about highly accurate estimates of correlation\nfunctions. The method is particularly suitable for long-range interacting\nsystems, and we demonstrate its power by comparing with exact results as well\nas other numerical methods. As an application we compute spin squeezing in a\ntwo-dimensional lattice with power-law interactions and a transverse field,\nwhich should be accessible in future ion trap experiments.\n", "  The $N = 28$ shell gap in sulfur, argon, calcium and titanium isotopes is\ninvestigated in the framework of relativistic continuum Hartree-Bogoliubov\n(RCHB) theory. The evolutions of neutron shell gap, separation energy, single\nparticle energy and pairing energy are analyzed, and it is found that $N = 28$\nshell gap is quenched in sulfur isotopes but persists in argon, calcium and\ntitanium isotopes. The evolution of $N = 28$ shell gap in $N = 28$ isotonic\nchain is discussed, and the erosion of $N = 28$ shell gap is understood with\nthe evolution of potential with proton number.\n", "  We have constructed an apparatus to study DC electrical breakdown in liquid\nhelium at temperatures as low as 0.4 K and at pressures between the saturated\nvapor pressure and $\\sim$600 torr. The apparatus can house a set of electrodes\nthat are 12 cm in diameter with a gap of $1-2$ cm between them, and a potential\nup to $\\pm 50$ kV can be applied to each electrode. Initial results\ndemonstrated that it is possible to apply fields exceeding 100 kV/cm in a 1 cm\ngap between two electropolished stainless steel electrodes 12 cm in diameter\nfor a wide range of pressures at 0.4 K. We also measured the current between\ntwo electrodes. Our initial results, $I<1$ pA at 45 kV, correspond to a lower\nbound on the effective volume resistivity of LHe of $\\rho_V > 5\\times10^{18}$\n$\\Omega\\cdot$cm. This lower bound is 5 times larger than the bound previously\nmeasured. We report the design, construction, and operational experience of the\napparatus, as well as initial results.\n", "  We analytically compute, through the eight-and-a-half post-Newtonian order\nand the fourth-order in spin, the gravitational self-force correction to\nDetweiler's gauge invariant redshift function for a small mass in circular\norbit around a Kerr black hole. Using the first law of mechanics for black hole\nbinaries with spin [L.~Blanchet, A.~Buonanno and A.~Le Tiec, Phys.\\ Rev.\\ D\n{\\bf 87}, 024030 (2013)] we transcribe our results into a knowledge of various\nspin-dependent couplings, as encoded within the spinning effective-one-body\nmodel of T.~Damour and A.~Nagar [Phys.\\ Rev.\\ D {\\bf 90}, 044018 (2014)]. We\nalso compare our analytical results to the (corrected) numerical self-force\nresults of A.~G.~Shah, J.~L.~Friedman and T.~S.~Keidl [Phys.\\ Rev.\\ D {\\bf 86},\n084059 (2012)], from which we show how to directly extract physically relevant\nspin-dependent couplings.\n", "  We report a measurement of the spin-flip probabilities for ultracold neutrons\ninteracting with surfaces coated with nickel phosphorus. For 50~$\\mu$m thick\nnickel phosphorus coated on stainless steel, the spin-flip probability per\nbounce was found to be $\\beta_{\\rm NiP\\;on\\;SS} = (3.3^{+1.8}_{-5.6}) \\times\n10^{-6}$. For 50~$\\mu$m thick nickel phosphorus coated on aluminum, the\nspin-flip probability per bounce was found to be $\\beta_{\\rm NiP\\;on\\;Al} =\n(3.6^{+2.1}_{-5.9}) \\times 10^{-6}$. For the copper guide used as reference,\nthe spin flip probability per bounce was found to be $\\beta_{\\rm Cu} =\n(6.7^{+5.0}_{-2.5}) \\times 10^{-6}$. The results on the nickel\nphosphorus-coated surfaces may be interpreted as upper limits, yielding\n$\\beta_{\\rm NiP\\;on\\;SS} < 6.2 \\times 10^{-6}$ (90\\% C.L.) and $\\beta_{\\rm\nNiP\\;on\\;Al} < 7.0 \\times 10^{-6}$ (90\\% C.L.) for 50~$\\mu$m thick nickel\nphosphorus coated on stainless steel and 50~$\\mu$m thick nickel phosphorus\ncoated on aluminum, respectively. Nickel phosphorus coated stainless steel or\naluminum provides a solution when low-cost, mechanically robust, and\nnon-depolarizing UCN guides with a high-Fermi-potential are needed.\n", "  In this paper we describe the methods and tools used to characterize a 150\nMeV proton scaling Fixed Field Alternating Gradient (FFAG) accelerator at Kyoto\nUniversity Research Reactor Institute. Many of the techniques used are unique\nto this class of machine and are thus of relevance to any future FFAG\naccelerator. For the first time we detail systematic studies undertaken to\nimprove the beam quality of the FFAG. The control of beam quality in this\nmanner is crucial to demonstrating high power operation of FFAG accelerators in\nfuture.\n", "  We study the fidelity of single qubit quantum gates performed with\ntwo-frequency laser fields that have a Gaussian or super Gaussian spatial mode.\nNumerical simulations are used to account for imperfections arising from atomic\nmotion in an optical trap, spatially varying Stark shifts of the trapping and\ncontrol beams, and transverse and axial misalignment of the control beams.\nNumerical results that account for the three dimensional distribution of\ncontrol light show that a super Gaussian mode with intensity $I\\sim\ne^{-2(r/w_0)^n}$ provides reduced sensitivity to atomic motion and beam\nmisalignment. Choosing a super Gaussian with $n=6$ the decay time of finite\ntemperature Rabi oscillations can be increased by a factor of 60 compared to an\n$n=2$ Gaussian beam, while reducing crosstalk to neighboring qubit sites.\n", "  We report diffusion Monte Carlo results for the ground state of unpolarized\nspin-1/2 fermions in a cylindrical container and properties of the system with\na vortex-line excitation. The density profile of the system with a vortex line\npresents a non-zero density at the core. We calculate the ground-state energy\nper particle, the superfluid pairing gap, and the excitation energy per\nparticle. These simulations can be extended to calculate the properties of\nvortex excitations in other strongly interacting systems, such as superfluid\nneutron matter using realistic nuclear Hamiltonians.\n", "  The random walk formalism is used across a wide range of applications, from\nmodelling share prices to predicting population genetics. Likewise quantum\nwalks have shown much potential as a frame- work for developing new quantum\nalgorithms. In this paper, we present explicit efficient quantum circuits for\nimplementing continuous-time quantum walks on the circulant class of graphs.\nThese circuits allow us to sample from the output probability distributions of\nquantum walks on circulant graphs efficiently. We also show that solving the\nsame sampling problem for arbitrary circulant quantum circuits is intractable\nfor a classical computer, assuming conjectures from computational complexity\ntheory. This is a new link between continuous-time quantum walks and\ncomputational complexity theory and it indicates a family of tasks which could\nultimately demonstrate quantum supremacy over classical computers. As a proof\nof principle we have experimentally implemented the proposed quantum circuit on\nan example circulant graph using a two-qubit photonics quantum processor.\n", "  We present here the general expressions for the acceleration of massive test\nparticles along the symmetry axis of the Kerr metric, and then study the main\nproperties of this acceleration in different regions of the spacetime. In\nparticular, we show that there exists a region near the black hole in which the\ngravitational field is repulsive. We provide possible physical interpretations\nabout the role of this effect in terms of the different conserved parameters.\nThe studies of these geodesics are important not only to understand better the\nstructure of the Kerr spacetime but also to its use as a possible mechanism for\nthe production of extragalactic jets. Our results are obtained with the help of\nexpressing the geodesics of the Kerr spacetime in terms of the Weyl\ncoordinates.\n", "  An asymptotic investigation of monochromatic electromagnetic fields in a\nlayered periodic medium is carried out under the assumption that the wave\nfrequency is close to the frequency of a stationary point of the dispersion\nsurface. We find solutions of Maxwell equations by the method of two-scale\nasymptotic expansions. We establish that the principal order of the expansion\nof a solution dependent on three spatial coordinates is the sum of two\ndifferently polarized Floquet-Bloch solutions, each of which is multiplied by a\nslowly varying envelope function. We derive that the envelope functions satisfy\na system of differential equations with constant coefficients. In new\nvariables, it is reduced to a system of two independent equations, both of them\nare either hyperbolic or elliptic, depending on the type of the stationary\npoint. The envelope functions are independent only in the planar case. Some\nconsequences are discussed.\n", "  Universal scaling laws can guide the understanding of new phenomena, and for\ncuprate high-temperature superconductivity such an early influential relation\nshowed that the critical temperature of superconductivity ($T_c$) correlates\nwith the density of the superfluid measured at low temperatures. This famous\nUemura relation has been inspiring the community ever since. Here we show that\nthe charge content of the bonding orbitals of copper and oxygen in the\nubiquitous CuO$_2$ plane, accessible with nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), is\ntied to the Uemura scaling. This charge distribution between copper and oxygen\nvaries between cuprate families and with doping, and it allows us to draw a new\nphase diagram that has different families sorted with respect to their maximum\n$T_c$. Moreover, it also shows that $T_c$ could be raised substantially if we\nwere able to synthesize materials in which more oxygen charge is transferred to\nthe approximately half filled copper orbital.\n", "  We present ab initio predictions for ground and excited states of doubly\nopen-shell fluorine and neon isotopes based on chiral two- and three-nucleon\ninteractions. We use the in-medium similarity renormalization group, in both\nflow-equation and Magnus formulations, to derive mass-dependent sd\nvalence-space Hamiltonians. The experimental ground-state energies are\nreproduced through neutron number N=14, beyond which a new targeted\nnormal-ordering procedure improves agreement with data and large-scale\nmulti-reference calculations. For spectroscopy, we focus on neutron-rich 23-26F\nand 24-26Ne isotopes near N=14,16 magic numbers. In all cases we find an\nagreement with experiment competitive with established phenomenology. Moreover,\nyrast states are well described in 20Ne and 24Mg, providing an ab initio\ndescription of deformation in the medium-mass region.\n", "  We study the possibility that inflation is driven by a massive vector field\nwith SO(3) global symmetry nonminimally coupled to gravity. From an\nE^3-invariant Robertson-Walker metric we propose an Ansatz for the vector\nfield, allowing us to study the evolution of the system. We study the behaviour\nof the equations of motion using the methods of the theory of dynamical systems\nand find exponential inflationary regimes.\n", "  Magnetic dipole emission (MDE) from interstellar magnetic nanoparticles is an\nimportant Galactic foreground in the microwave frequencies, and its\npolarization level may pose great challenges for achieving reliable\nmeasurements of cosmic microwave background (CMB) B-mode signal. To obtain\ntheoretical constraints on the polarization of MDE, we first compute the degree\nof alignment of big silicate grains incorporated with magnetic inclusions. We\nfind that, in realistic conditions of the interstellar medium, thermally\nrotating big grains with magnetic inclusions are weakly aligned and achieve\n{\\it alignment saturation} when the magnetic alignment rate becomes much faster\nthan the rotational damping rate. We then compute the degree of alignment for\nfree-flying magnetic nanoparticles, taking into account various interaction\nprocesses of grains with the ambient gas and radiation field, including neutral\ncollisions, ion collisions, and infrared emission. We find that the rotational\ndamping by infrared emission can significantly decrease the degree of alignment\nof small particles from the saturation level, whereas the excitation by ion\ncollisions can enhance the alignment of ultrasmall particles. Using the\ncomputed degrees of alignment, we predict the polarization level of MDE from\nfree-flying magnetic nanoparticles to be rather low. Such a polarization level\nis within the upper limits measured for anomalous microwave emission (AME),\nwhich indicates that MDE from free-flying iron particles may not be ruled out\nas a source of AME. We also quantify spinning dust emission from free-flying\niron nanoparticles with permanent magnetic moments and find that its emissivity\nis one order of magnitude lower than that from spinning polycyclic aromatic\nhydrocarbons (PAHs). Finally, we compute the polarization spectra of spinning\ndust emission from PAHs for the different interstellar magnetic fields.\n", "  Motivated by recent experimental efforts, we study a black hole analog\ninduced by the propagation of a strong laser pulse in a nonlinear dielectric\nmedium. Based on the Hopfield model (one pair of Sellmeier coefficients), we\nperform an analytic and fully relativistic microscopic derivation of the analog\nof Hawking radiation in this setup. The Hawking temperature is determined by\nthe analog of the surface gravity (as expected), but we also find a\nfrequency-dependent gray-body factor (i.e., a nonthermal spectrum at infinity)\ndue to the breaking of conformal invariance in this setup.\n", "  We point out that in unimodular gravity Newton's constant is an essential\ncoupling, i.e. it is independent of field redefinitions. We illustrate the\nconsequences of this fact by a calculation in a standard simple approximation,\nshowing that in this case the renormalization group flow of Newton's constant\nis gauge and parametrization independent.\n", "  Dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) has become a very important\nhyperpolarization method because it can dramatically increase the sensitivity\nof nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) of various molecules. Liquid-state DNP\nbased on Overhauser effect is capable of directly enhancing polarizations of\nall kinds of nuclei in the system. The combination of simultaneous Overhauser\nmulti-nuclei enhancements with the multi-nuclei parallel acquisitions provides\na variety of important applications in both MR spectroscopy (MRS) and image\n(MRI). Here we present two simple illustrative examples for simultaneously\nenhanced multi-nuclear spectra and images to demonstrate the principle and\nsuperiority. We have observed very large simultaneous DNP enhancements for\ndifferent nuclei, such as 1H and 23Na, 1H and 31P, 19F and 31P, especially for\nthe first time to report sodium ion enhancement in liquid. We have also\nobtained the simultaneous imaging of 19H and 31P at low field by solution-state\nDNP for the first time. This method can obtain considerably complementary\nstructure-determination information of miscellaneous biomolecules from a single\nmeasurement. It can also be used in combination with the fast acquisition\nschemes and quantitative analysis with reduced scan time.\n", "  Aquaporin-1 (AQP1) is a membrane protein which is selectively permeable to\nwater. Due to its dumbbell shape, AQP1 can sense the size information of solute\nmolecules in osmosis. At the cost of consuming this information, AQP1 can move\nwater against its chemical potential gradient: it is able to work as one kind\nof Maxwell's Demon. This effect was detected quantitatively by measuring the\nwater osmosis of mice red blood cells. This ability may protect the red blood\ncells from the eryptosis elicited by osmotic shock when they move in the\nkidney, where a large gradient of urea is required for the urine concentrating\nmechanism. This finding anticipates a new beginning of inquiries into the\ncomplicated relationships among mass, energy and information in bio-systems.\n", "  Nuclear mass contains a wealth of nuclear structure information, and has been\nwidely employed to extract the nuclear effective interactions. The known\nnuclear mass is usually extracted from the experimental atomic mass by\nsubtracting the masses of electrons and adding the binding energy of electrons\nin the atom. However, the binding energies of electrons are sometimes neglected\nin extracting the known nuclear masses. The influence of binding energies of\nelectrons on nuclear mass predictions are carefully investigated in this work.\nIf the binding energies of electrons are directly subtracted from the\ntheoretical mass predictions, the rms deviations of nuclear mass predictions\nwith respect to the known data are increased by about $200$ keV for nuclei with\n$Z, N\\geqslant 8$. Furthermore, by using the Coulomb energies between protons\nto absorb the binding energies of electrons, their influence on the rms\ndeviations is significantly reduced to only about $10$ keV for nuclei with $Z,\nN\\geqslant 8$. However, the binding energies of electrons are still important\nfor the heavy nuclei, about $150$ keV for nuclei around $Z=100$ and up to about\n$500$ keV for nuclei around $Z=120$. Therefore, it is necessary to consider the\nbinding energies of electrons to reliably predict the masses of heavy nuclei at\nan accuracy of hundreds of keV.\n", "  We study the percolation in coupled networks with both inner-dependency and\ninter-dependency links, where the inner- and inter-dependency links represent\nthe dependencies between nodes in the same or different networks, respectively.\nWe find that when most of dependency links are inner- or inter-ones, the\ncoupled networks system is fragile and makes a discontinuous percolation\ntransition. However, when the numbers of two types of dependency links are\nclose to each other, the system is robust and makes a continuous percolation\ntransition. This indicates that the high density of dependency links could not\nalways lead to a discontinuous percolation transition as the previous studies.\nMore interestingly, although the robustness of the system can be optimized by\nadjusting the ratio of the two types of dependency links, there exists a\ncritical average degree of the networks for coupled random networks, below\nwhich the crossover of the two types of percolation transitions disappears, and\nthe system will always demonstrate a discontinuous percolation transition. We\nalso develop an approach to analyze this model, which is agreement with the\nsimulation results well.\n", "  The supernova (SN) Hubble diagram residual contains valuable information on\nboth the present matter power spectrum and its growth history. In this paper we\nshow that this information can be retrieved with precision by combining both\npeculiar velocity and weak-lensing analysis on the data. To wit, peculiar\nvelocity induces correlations on the nearby SN while lensing induces a\nnon-Gaussian dispersion in faraway objects. We show that both effects have\nalmost orthogonal degeneracies and discuss how they can be extracted\nsimultaneously from the data. We analyze the JLA supernova catalog in a\n14-dimensional parameter space, assuming a flexible growth-rate index $\\gamma$.\nWe arrive at the following marginalized constraints: $\\sigma_8 =\n0.65^{+0.23}_{-0.37}$ and $\\gamma = 1.38^{+1.7}_{-0.65}$. Assuming instead GR\nas the correct gravitation theory (and thus $\\gamma \\equiv 0.55$), the\nconstraints in $\\sigma_8$ tighten further: $\\sigma_8 = 0.40^{+0.21}_{-0.23}$.\nWe show that these constraints complement well the ones obtained from other\ndatasets and that they could improve substantially with more SNe.\n", "  Models of cosmic inflation suggest that our universe underwent an early phase\nof accelerated expansion, driven by the dynamics of one or more scalar fields.\nInflationary models make specific, quantitative predictions for several\nobservable quantities, including particular patterns of temperature anistropies\nin the cosmic microwave background radiation. Realistic models of high-energy\nphysics include many scalar fields at high energies. Moreover, we may expect\nthese fields to have nonminimal couplings to the spacetime curvature. Such\ncouplings are quite generic, arising as renormalization counterterms when\nquantizing scalar fields in curved spacetime. In this chapter I review recent\nresearch on a general class of multifield inflationary models with nonminimal\ncouplings. Models in this class exhibit a strong attractor behavior: across a\nwide range of couplings and initial conditions, the fields evolve along a\nsingle-field trajectory for most of inflation. Across large regions of phase\nspace and parameter space, therefore, models in this general class yield robust\npredictions for observable quantities that fall squarely within the \"sweet\nspot\" of recent observations.\n", "  We develop an electron transport theory for the hybrid system of a\nsemiconducting carbon nanotube that encapsulates a one-atom-thick metallic\nwire. The theory predicts Fano resonances in electron transport through the\nsystem, whereby the interaction of electrons on the wire with nanotube plasmon\ngenerated near-fields blocks some of the wire transmission channels to open up\nthe new coherent plasmon-mediated channel in the nanotube forbidden gap outside\nthe wire transmission band. Such a channel makes the entire hybrid system\ntransparent in the energy domain where neither wire, nor nanotube is\nindivudually transparent. This effect can be used to manipulate by the electron\ncharge transfer in hybrid nanodevices built on metal-semiconductor nanotube\nsystems.\n", "  We describe in details the procedure how the Lobachevsky space can be\nfactorized to a space of the constant negative curvature filled with a gas of\nwormholes. We show that such wormholes have throat sections in the form of tori\nand are traversable and stable in the cosmological context. The relation of\nsuch wormholes to the dark matter phenomenon is briefly described. We also\ndiscuss the possibility of the existence of analogous factorizations for all\ntypes of homogeneous spaces.\n", "  We observe a series of sharp resonant features in the differential\nconductance of graphene-hexagonal boron nitride-graphene tunnel transistors\nover a wide range of bias voltages between $\\sim$10 and 200 mV. We attribute\nthem to electron tunneling assisted by the emission of phonons of well-defined\nenergy. The bias voltages at which they occur are insensitive to the applied\ngate voltage and hence independent of the carrier densities in the graphene\nelectrodes, so plasmonic effects can be ruled out. The phonon energies\ncorresponding to the resonances are compared with the lattice dispersion curves\nof graphene-boron nitride heterostructures and are close to peaks in the single\nphonon density of states.\n", "  We study Josephson junctions made of semiconducting nanowires with Rashba\nspin-orbit coupling, where superconducting correlations are induced by the\nproximity effect. In the presence of a suitably directed magnetic field, the\nsystem displays the anomalous Josephson effect: a nonzero supercurrent in the\nabsence of a phase bias between two superconductors. We show that this\nanomalous current can be increased significantly by tuning the nanowire into\nthe helical regime. In particular, in a short junction, a large anomalous\ncurrent is a signature for topologically nontrivial superconductivity in the\nnanowire.\n", "  We present measurements of the electron-recoil (ER) response of the LUX dark\nmatter detector based upon 170,000 highly pure and spatially-uniform tritium\ndecays. We reconstruct the tritium energy spectrum using the combined energy\nmodel and find good agreement with expectations. We report the average charge\nand light yields of ER events in liquid xenon at 180 V/cm and 105 V/cm and\ncompare the results to the NEST model. We also measure the mean charge\nrecombination fraction and its fluctuations, and we investigate the location\nand width of the LUX ER band. These results provide input to a re-analysis of\nthe LUX Run3 WIMP search.\n", "  We generalize the Elliott-Yafet (EY) theory of spin relaxation in metals with\ninversion symmetry for the case of large spin-orbit coupling (SOC). The EY\ntheory treats the SOC to the lowest order but this approach breaks down for\nmetals of heavy elements (such as e.g. caesium or gold), where the SOC energy\nis comparable to the relevant band-band separation energies. The generalized\ntheory is presented for a four-band model system without band dispersion, where\nanalytic formulae are attainable for arbitrary SOC for the relation between the\nmomentum- and spin-relaxation rates. As an extended description, we also\nconsider an empirical pseudopotential approximation where SOC is deduced from\nthe band potential (apart from an empirical scaling constant) and the\nspin-relaxation rate can be obtained numerically. Both approaches recover the\nusual EY theory for weak SOC and give that the spin-relaxation rate approaches\nthe momentum-relaxation rate in the limit of strong SOC. We argue that this\nlimit is realized in gold by analyzing spin relaxation data. A calculation of\nthe $g$-factor shows that the empirical Elliott-relation, which links the\n$g$-factor and spin-relaxation rate, is retained even for strong SOC.\n", "  The giant impact phase of terrestrial planet formation establishes\nconnections between super-Earths' orbital properties (semimajor axis spacings,\neccentricities, mutual inclinations) and interior compositions (the presence or\nabsence of gaseous envelopes). Using N-body simulations and analytic arguments,\nwe show that spacings derive not only from eccentricities, but also from\ninclinations. Flatter systems attain tighter spacings, a consequence of an\neccentricity equilibrium between gravitational scatterings, which increase\neccentricities, and mergers, which damp them. Dynamical friction by residual\ndisk gas plays a critical role in regulating mergers and in damping\ninclinations and eccentricities. Systems with moderate gas damping and high\nsolid surface density spawn gas-enveloped super-Earths with tight spacings,\nsmall eccentricities, and small inclinations. Systems in which super-Earths\ncoagulate without as much ambient gas, in disks with low solid surface density,\nproduce rocky planets with wider spacings, larger eccentricities, and larger\nmutual inclinations. A combination of both populations can reproduce the\nobserved distributions of spacings, period ratios, transiting planet\nmultiplicities, and transit duration ratios exhibited by Kepler super-Earths.\nThe two populations, both formed in situ, also help to explain observed trends\nof eccentricity vs. planet size, and bulk density vs. method of mass\nmeasurement (radial velocities vs. transit timing variations). Simplifications\nmade in this study --- including the limited timespan of the simulations, and\nthe approximate treatments of gas dynamical friction and gas depletion history\n--- should be improved upon in future work to enable a detailed quantitative\ncomparison to the observations.\n", "  Interface-enhanced high-temperature superconductivity in one unit-cell (UC)\nFeSe films on SrTiO3(001) (STO) substrate has recently attracted much attention\nin condensed matter physics and material science. By combined in-situ scanning\ntunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS) and ex-situ scanning transmission\nelectron microscopy (STEM) studies, we report on atomically resolved structure\nincluding both lattice constants and actual atomic positions of the FeSe/STO\ninterface under both non-superconducting and superconducting states. We\nobserved TiO2 double layers (DLs) and significant atomic displacements in the\ntop two layers of STO, lattice compression of the Se-Fe-Se triple layer, and\nrelative shift between bottom Se and topmost Ti atoms. By imaging the interface\nstructures under various superconducting states, we unveil a close correlation\nbetween interface structure and superconductivity. Our atomic-scale\nidentification of FeSe/STO interface structure provides useful information on\ninvestigating the pairing mechanism of this interface-enhanced high-temperature\nsuperconducting system.\n", "  We examine the squeezed limit of the bispectrum when a light scalar with\narbitrary non-derivative self-interactions is coupled to the inflaton. We find\nthat when the hidden sector scalar is sufficiently light ($m\\lesssim0.1\\,H$),\nthe coupling between long and short wavelength modes from the series of higher\norder correlation functions (from arbitrary order contact diagrams) causes the\nstatistics of the fluctuations to vary in sub-volumes. This means that\nobservations of primordial non-Gaussianity cannot be used to uniquely\nreconstruct the potential of the hidden field. However, the local bispectrum\ninduced by mode-coupling from these diagrams always has the same squeezed\nlimit, so the field's locally determined mass is not affected by this cosmic\nvariance.\n", "  A spin-space extension is reviewed, which provides information on the\nstandard model. Its defining feature is a common matrix space that describes\nsymmetries and representations, and leads to limits on these, for given\ndimension. The model provides additional information on the standard model,\nwhose interpretation requires an interactive formulation. Within this program,\nwe compare the model's lepton-W generated interactive Lagrangian in\n(5+1)-dimensions, and that of the standard model. We derive the conditions for\nthis matching, which apply to other Lagrangian terms. We also discuss the\nadvantages of this extension, as compared to others.\n", "  We investigate the photon-mediated heat flow between two Josephson-coupled\nBardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) superconductors. We demonstrate that in\nstandard low temperature experiments involving temperature-biased\nsuperconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs), this radiative\ncontribution is negligible if compared to the direct galvanic one, but it\nlargely exceeds the heat exchanged between electrons and the lattice phonons.\nThe corresponding thermal conductance is found to be several orders of\nmagnitude smaller, for real experiments setup parameters, than the universal\nquantum of thermal conductance, kappa_0(T)=pi k_B^2T/6hbar.\n", "  A deterministic photon-photon quantum-logic gate is a long-standing goal.\nBuilding such a gate becomes possible if a light pulse containing only one\nphoton imprints a phase shift of $\\pi$ onto another light field. Here we\nexperimentally demonstrate the generation of such a $\\pi$ phase shift with a\nsingle-photon pulse. A first light pulse containing less than one photon on\naverage is stored in an atomic gas. Rydberg blockade combined with\nelectromagnetically induced transparency creates a phase shift for a second\nlight pulse which propagates through the medium. Postselected on the detection\nof a retrieved photon from the first pulse, we measure a $\\pi$ phase shift of\nthe second pulse. This demonstrates a crucial step toward a photon-photon gate\nand offers a variety of applications in the field of quantum information\nprocessing.\n", "  We study the recently reported excess in the diphoton resonance search by\nATLAS and CMS. We investigate the available parameter space in the combined\nrun-1 and run-2 diphoton data and study its interpretation in terms of a\nsinglet scalar field which possibly mixes with the Standard Model Higgs boson.\nWe show that the mixing angle is already strongly constrained by high-mass\nHiggs searches in the diboson channel, and by Higgs coupling measurements.\nWhile a broad resonance is slightly favored, we argue that the signal is\nconsistent with a narrow-width singlet which couples to colored and\nelectromagnetically-charged vector-like fermions. Dijet signals are predicted\nand may be visible in upcoming analyses. Allowing for additional decay modes\ncould explain a broader resonance, however, we show that monojet searches\ndisfavor a large invisible width. Finally, we comment on the possible relation\nof this scenario to the naturalness problem.\n", "  We study circumbinary accretion discs in the framework of the restricted\nthree-body problem (R3Bp) and via numerically solving the height-integrated\nequations of viscous hydrodynamics. Varying the mass ratio of the binary, we\nfind a pronounced change in the behaviour of the disc near mass ratio $q \\equiv\nM_s/M_p \\sim 0.04$. For mass ratios above $q=0.04$, solutions for the\nhydrodynamic flow transition from steady, to strongly-fluctuating; a narrow\nannular gap in the surface density around the secondary's orbit changes to a\nhollow central cavity; and a spatial symmetry is lost, resulting in a lopsided\ndisc. This phase transition is coincident with the mass ratio above which\nstable orbits do not exist around the L4 and L5 equilibrium points of the R3B\nproblem. Using the DISCO code, we find that for thin discs, for which a gap or\ncavity can remain open, the mass ratio of the transition is relatively\ninsensitive to disc viscosity and pressure. The $q=0.04$ transition has\nrelevance for the evolution of massive black hole binary+disc systems at the\ncenters of galactic nuclei, as well as for young stellar binaries and possibly\nplanets around brown dwarfs.\n", "  As part of the T-REX project, a number of R&D and prototyping activities have\nbeen carried out during the last years to explore the applicability of\nMicromegas-read gaseous TPCs in rare event searches like double beta decay\n(DBD), axion research and low-mass WIMP searches. While in the companion paper\nwe focus on DBD, in this paper we focus on the results regarding the search for\ndark matter candidates, both axions and WIMPs. Small ultra-low background\nMicromegas detectors are used to image the x-ray signal expected in axion\nhelioscopes like CAST at CERN. Background levels as low as $0.8\\times 10^{-6}$\nc keV$^{-1}$cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ have already been achieved in CAST while values\ndown to $\\sim10^{-7}$ c keV$^{-1}$cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ have been obtained in a\ntest bench placed underground in the Laboratorio Subterr\\'aneo de Canfranc.\nProspects to consolidate and further reduce these values down to $\\sim10^{-8}$\nc keV$^{-1}$cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$will be described. Such detectors, placed at the\nfocal point of x-ray telescopes in the future IAXO experiment, would allow for\n10$^5$ better signal-to-noise ratio than CAST, and search for solar axions with\n$g_{a\\gamma}$ down to few 10$^{12}$ GeV$^{-1}$, well into unexplored axion\nparameter space. In addition, a scaled-up version of these TPCs, properly\nshielded and placed underground, can be competitive in the search for low-mass\nWIMPs. The TREX-DM prototype, with $\\sim$0.300 kg of Ar at 10 bar, or\nalternatively $\\sim$0.160 kg of Ne at 10 bar, and energy threshold well below 1\nkeV, has been built to test this concept. We will describe the main technical\nsolutions developed, as well as the results from the commissioning phase on\nsurface. The anticipated sensitivity of this technique might reach\n$\\sim10^{-44}$ cm$^2$ for low mass ($<10$ GeV) WIMPs, well beyond current\nexperimental limits in this mass range.\n", "  Coupling a quantum many-body system to a cavity can create bifurcation points\nin its phase diagram, where the ground state makes sudden switchings between\ndifferent phases. Here we study the dynamical quantum phase transition of a\ntransverse field Ising model coupled to a cavity. We show that an infinitesimal\nquench of the cavity driving at the bifurcation points induces gradual\nevolution of the Ising model to pass across the quantum critical point and\nexcites quasiparticles. Meanwhile, when the driving is slowly ramped through\nthe bifurcation points, the adiabaticity of the evolution and the number of\nquasiparticle excitations are strongly affected by cavity-induced nonlinearity.\nIntroducing and manipulating cavity-induced nonlinearity hence provide an\neffective approach to control the dynamics and the adiabaticity of adiabatic\nquantum processes. Our model can be implemented with superconducting quantum\ncircuits.\n", "  We report on image processing techniques and experimental procedures to\ndetermine the lattice-site positions of single atoms in an optical lattice with\nhigh reliability, even for limited acquisition time or optical resolution.\nDetermining the positions of atoms beyond the diffraction limit relies on\nparametric deconvolution in close analogy to methods employed in\nsuper-resolution microscopy. We develop a deconvolution method that makes\neffective use of the prior knowledge of the optical transfer function, noise\nproperties, and discreteness of the optical lattice. We show that accurate\nknowledge of the image formation process enables a dramatic improvement on the\nlocalization reliability. This allows us to demonstrate super-resolution of the\natoms' position in closely packed ensembles where the separation between\nparticles cannot be directly optically resolved. Furthermore, we demonstrate\nexperimental methods to precisely reconstruct the point spread function with\nsub-pixel resolution from fluorescence images of single atoms, and we give a\nmathematical foundation thereof. We also discuss discretized image sampling in\npixel detectors and provide a quantitative model of noise sources in electron\nmultiplying CCD cameras. The techniques developed here are not only beneficial\nto neutral atom experiments, but could also be employed to improve the\nlocalization precision of trapped ions for ultra precise force sensing.\n", "  In this paper, we study the thermodynamics of quantum harmonic oscillator in\nthe Tsallis framework and in the presence of a minimal length uncertainty. The\nexistence of the minimal length is motivated by various theories such as string\ntheory, loop quantum gravity, and black-hole physics. We analytically obtain\nthe partition function, probability function, internal energy, and the specific\nheat capacity of the vibrational quantum system for $1<q<\\frac{3}{2}$ and\ncompare the results with those of Tsallis and Boltzmann-Gibbs statistics\nwithout the minimal length scale.\n", "  Chaotic electromagnetic fields are common in many relativistic plasma\nenvironments, where they can be excited by instabilities on kinetic spatial\nscales. When strong electric fluctuations exist on sub-electron scales, they\nmay lead to small-angle, stochastic deflections of the electrons' pitch-angles.\nUnder certain conditions, this closely resembles the effect of Coulomb\ncollisions in collisional plasmas. The electric pitch-angle diffusion\ncoefficient acts as an effective collision -- or \"quasi-collision\" --\nfrequency. We show that quasi-collisions may radically alter the expected\nradiative transport properties of candidate plasmas. In particular, we consider\nthe quasi-collisional generalization of the classical Faraday effect.\n", "  We present a polarization-resolved and temperature-dependent Raman scattering\nstudy of AFe2As2 (A = Ca, Eu). In the spin-density-wave (SDW) phase, spectral\nweight redistribution is observed in the fully symmetric and non-symmetric\nscattering channels at different energies. An anisotropic Raman response is\nobserved in the fully symmetric channel in spontaneously detwinned CaFe2As2\nsamples. We calculate the orbital-resolved electronic structures using a\ncombination of density functional theory and dynamical mean field theory\n(DFT+DMFT). We identify the electronic transitions corresponding to these two\nspectral features and find that the anisotropic Raman response originates from\nthe lifted degeneracy of the dxz/yz orbitals in the broken symmetry phase.\n", "  The gamma-ray observation of dwarf spheroidal satellites (dSphs) is an ideal\napproach for probing the dark matter (DM) annihilation signature. The latest\nFermi-LAT dSph searches have set stringent constraints on the velocity\nindependent annihilation cross section in the small DM mass range, which gives\nvery strong constraints on the scenario to explain the the AMS-02 positron\nexcess by DM annihilation. However, the dSph constraints would change in the\nvelocity dependent annihilation scenarios, because the velocity dispersion in\nthe dSphs varies from that in the Milky Way. In this work, we use a likelihood\nmap method to set constraints on the velocity dependent annihilation cross\nsection from the Fermi-LAT observation of six dSphs. We consider three typical\nforms of the annihilation cross section, i.e. p-wave annihilation, Sommerfeld\nenhancement, and Breit-Wigner resonance. For the p-wave annihilation and\nSommerfeld-enhancement, the dSph limits would become much weaker and stronger\ncompared with those for the velocity independent annihilation, respectively.\nFor the Breit-Wigner annihilation, the dSph limits would vary depending on the\nmodel parameters. We show that the scenario to explain the AMS-02 positron\nexcess by DM annihilation is still viable in the velocity dependent cases.\n", "  The dynamic behavior of vortex pairs in two-component coherently (Rabi)\ncoupled Bose-Einstein condensates is investigated in the presence of harmonic\ntrapping. We discuss the role of the surface tension associated with the domain\nwall connecting two vortices in condensates of atoms occupying different spin\nstates and its effect on the precession of the vortex pair. The results, based\non the numerical solution of the Gross-Pitaevskii equations, are compared with\nthe predictions of an analytical macroscopic model and are discussed as a\nfunction of the size of the pair, the Rabi coupling and the inter-component\ninteraction. We show that the increase of the Rabi coupling results in the\ndisintegration of the domain wall into smaller pieces, connecting vortices of\nnew-created vortex pairs. The resulting scenario is the analogue of quark\nconfinement and string breaking in quantum chromodynamics.\n", "  In ultra-thin film of topological insulator, the hybridization between the\ntop and bottom surfaces opens an energy gap and forms two degenerate quantum\nanomalous Hall states, which give rise to a quantum spin Hall state. In this\npaper, we demonstrate that a Weyl semimetal can be realized in an ultra-thin\nfilm of topological insulator heterostructure in a similar way to that of the\nsurface state of a strong three-dimensional (3D) topological insulator studied\nby Burkov and Balents . We find that the system realizes both 3D quantum\nanomalous Hall phase and 3D quantum spin Hall phase, and the Weyl nodes occur\nat zero energy when both time-reversal symmetry and inversion symmetry are\nexplicitly broken by the magnetic field and the structure inversion asymmetry\nof the thin film.\n", "  We discuss resonant squark production at the LHC via baryonic $R$-parity\nviolating interactions. The cross section easily exceeds pair-production and a\nnew set of signatures can be used to probe squarks, particularly stops. These\ninclude dijet resonances, same-sign top quarks and four-jet resonances with\nlarge $b$-jet multiplicities, as well as the possibility of displaced\nneutralino decays. We use publicly available searches at $\\sqrt{s}=8$ TeV and\nfirst results from collisions at $\\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV to set upper limits on\n$R$-parity violating couplings, with particular focus on simplified models with\nlight stops and neutralinos. The exclusion reach of these signatures is\ncomparable to $R$-parity-conserving searches, $m_{\\tilde t}\\simeq 500-700$ GeV.\nIn addition, we find that O(1) couplings involving the stop can be excluded\nwell into the multi-TeV range, and stress that new searches for single- and\npair-produced four-jet resonances will be necessary to exclude sub-TeV stops\nfor a natural SUSY spectrum with light higgsinos.\n", "  Localization of relativistic particles have been of great research interests\nover many decades. We investigate the time evolution of the Gaussian wave\npackets governed by the one dimensional Dirac equation. For the free Dirac\nequation, we obtain the evolution profiles analytically in many approximation\nregimes, and numerical simulations consistent with other numerical schemes.\nInteresting behaviors such as Zitterbewegung and Klein paradox are exhibited.\nIn particular, the dispersion rate as a function of mass is calculated, and it\nyields an interesting result that super-massive and massless particles both\nexhibit no dispersion in free space. For the Dirac equation with random\npotential or mass, we employ the Chebyshev polynomials expansion of the\npropagator operator to numerically investigate the probability profiles of the\ndisplacement distribution when the potential or mass is uniformly distributed.\nWe observe that the widths of the Gaussian wave packets decrease approximately\nwith the power law of order $o(s^{-\\nu})$ with $\\frac{1}{2}<\\nu<1$ as the\nrandomness strength $s$ increases. This suggests an onset of localization, but\nit is weaker than Anderson localization.\n", "  We study the initial conditions for Pb+Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm\nNN}}=2.76$ TeV using the two component Monte-Carlo Glauber model with shadowing\nof the nucleons in the interior by the leading ones. The model parameters are\nfixed by comparing to the multiplicity data of p+Pb and Pb+Pb at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm\nNN}}=5.02$ and $2.76$ TeV respectively. We then compute the centrality\ndependence of the eccentricities upto the fourth order as well as their event\nby event distributions. The inclusion of shadowing brings the Monte-Carlo\nGlauber model predictions in agreement with data as well as with results from\nother dynamical models of initial conditions based on gluon saturation at high\nenergy nuclear collisions. Further, we find that the shadowed Glauber model\nprovides the desired relative magnitude between the ellipticity and\ntriangularity of the initial energy distribution required to explain the data\non the even and odd flow harmonics $v_2$ and $v_3$ respectively at the LHC.\n", "  Organic-inorganic halide CH$_3$NH$_3$PbI$_3$ solar cells have attracted\nenormous attention in recent years due to their remarkable power conversion\nefficiency. When inversion symmetry is broken, these materials should exhibit\ninteresting spin-dependent properties as well, owing to their strong spin-orbit\ncoupling. In this work, we consider the spin-dependent optical response of\nCH$_3$NH$_3$PbI$_3$. We first use density functional theory to compute the\nballistic spin current generated by absorption of unpolarized light. We then\nconsider diffusive transport of photogenerated charge and spin for a thin\nCH$_3$NH$_3$PbI$_3$ layer with a passivated surface and an Ohmic, non-selective\ncontact. The spin density and spin current are evaluated by solving the\ndrift-diffusion equations for a simplified 3-dimensional Rashba model of the\nelectronic structure of the valence and conduction bands. We provide analytic\nexpressions for the photon flux required to induce measurable spin densities,\nand propose that these spin densities can provide useful information about the\nrole of grain boundaries in the photovoltaic behavior of these materials. We\nalso discuss the prospects for measuring the optically generated spin current\nwith the inverse spin Hall effect.\n", "  With the current measurements performed by CMS and ATLAS experiments, the\nlight charged Higgs scenario ($m_{H^{\\pm}}$ $<$ 160 GeV), is excluded for most\nof the parameter space in the context of MSSM. However, there is still\npossibility to look for heavy charged Higgs boson particularly in the\n$s$-channel single top production process where the charged Higgs may appear as\na heavy resonance state and decay to $t\\bar{b}$. The production process under\nconsideration in this paper is $pp \\ra H^{\\pm} \\ra t\\bar{b}~+~h.c.$, where the\ntop quark decays to $W^{+}b$ and $W^{+}$ boson subsequently decays to two light\njets. It is shown that despite the presence of large QCD and electroweak\nbackground events, the charged Higgs signal can be extracted and observed at a\nlarge area of MSSM parameter space ($m_{H^{\\pm}}$,tan$\\beta$) at LHC. The\nobservability of charged Higgs is potentially demonstrated with 5$\\sigma$\ncontours and $95\\%$ confidence level exclusion curves at different integrated\nLHC luminosities assuming a nominal center of mass energy of $\\sqrt{s}$ = 14\nTeV.\n", "  Infrared optical investigations of $\\alpha$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$I$_3$ have been\nperformed in the spectral range from 80 to 8000~cm$^{-1}$ down to temperatures\nas low as 10~K by applying hydrostatic pressure. In the metallic state, $T >\n135$~K, we observe a 50\\% increase in the Drude contribution as well as the\nmid-infrared band due to the growing intermolecular orbital overlap with\npressure up to 11~kbar. In the ordered state, $T<T_{\\rm CO}$, we extract how\nthe electronic charge per molecule varies with temperature and pressure:\nTransport and optical studies demonstrate that charge order and metal-insulator\ntransition coincide and consistently yield a linear decrease of the transition\ntemperature $T_{\\rm CO}$ by $8-9$~K/kbar. The charge disproportionation\n$\\Delta\\rho$ diminishes by $0.017~e$/kbar and the optical gap $\\Delta$ between\nthe bands decreases with pressure by -47~cm$^{-1}$/kbar. In our high-pressure\nand low-temperature experiments, we do observe contributions from the massive\ncharge carriers as well as from massless Dirac electrons to the low-frequency\noptical conductivity, however, without being able to disentangle them\nunambiguously.\n", "  We consider optical spectroscopy of molecular junctions from the quantum\ntransport perspective when radiation field is quantized and optical response of\nthe system is simulated as photon flux. Using exact expressions for photon and\nelectronic fluxes derived within the nonequilibrium Green function (NEGF)\nmethodology and utilizing fourth order diagrammatic perturbation theory in\nmolecular coupling to radiation field we perform simulations employing\nrealistic parameters. Results of the simulations are compared to the bare\nperturbation theory (PT) usually employed in studies on nonlinear optical\nspectroscopy to classify optical processes. We show that the bare PT violates\nconservation laws, while flux conserving NEGF formulation mixes optical\nprocesses.\n", "  The goal of two-party cryptography is to enable two parties, Alice and Bob,\nto solve common tasks without the need for mutual trust. Examples of such tasks\nare private access to a database, and secure identification. Quantum\ncommunication enables security for all of these problems in the noisy-storage\nmodel by sending more signals than the adversary can store in a certain time\nframe. Here, we initiate the study of device-independent protocols for\ntwo-party cryptography in the noisy-storage model. Specifically, we present a\nrelatively easy to implement protocol for a cryptographic building block known\nas weak string erasure and prove its security even if the devices used in the\nprotocol are prepared by the dishonest party. Device-independent two-party\ncryptography is made challenging by the fact that Alice and Bob do not trust\neach other, which requires new techniques to establish security. We fully\nanalyse the case of memoryless devices (for which sequential attacks are\noptimal) and the case of sequential attacks for arbitrary devices. The key\ningredient of the proof, which might be of independent interest, is an explicit\n(and tight) relation between the violation of the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt\ninequality observed by Alice and Bob and uncertainty generated by Alice against\nBob who is forced to measure his system before finding out Alice's setting\n(guessing with postmeasurement information). In particular, we show that\nsecurity is possible for arbitrarily small violation.\n", "  We predict enhanced electron-hole superfluidity in two coupled electron-hole\narmchair-edge terminated graphene nanoribbons separated by a thin insulating\nbarrier. In contrast to graphene monolayers, the multiple subbands of the\nnanoribbons are parabolic at low energy with a gap between the conduction and\nvalence bands, and with lifted valley degeneracy. These properties make\nscreening of the electron-hole interaction much weaker than for coupled\nelectron-hole monolayers, thus boosting the pairing strength and enhancing the\nsuperfluid properties. The pairing strength is further boosted by the\nquasi-one-dimensional quantum confinement of the carriers, as well as by the\nlarge density of states near the bottom of each subband. The latter magnifies\nthe superfluid shape resonances caused by the quantum confinement. Several\nsuperfluid partial condensates are present for finite-width nanoribbons with\nmultiple subbands. We find that superfluidity is predominately in the\nstrongly-coupled BEC and BCS-BEC crossover regimes, with large superfluid gaps\nup to 100 meV and beyond. When the gaps exceed the subband spacing, there is\nsignificant mixing of the subbands, a rounding of the shape resonances, and a\nresulting reduction in the one-dimensional nature of the system.\n", "  Quantum computation is the suitable orthogonal encoding of possibly holistic\nfunctional properties into state vectors, followed by a projective measurement.\n", "  The anomalous Hall effect (AHE) in strongly disordered magnetic systems has\nbeen buried in persistent confusion despite its long history. We report the AHE\nin perpendicularly magnetized L10-MnAl epitaxial films with variable orbital\ntwo-channel Kondo (2CK) effect arising from the strong coupling of conduction\nelectrons and the structural disorders of two-level systems. The AHE is\nobserved to excellently scale with pAH/f=a0pxx0+bpxx2 at high temperatures\nwhere phonon scattering prevails. In contrast, significant deviation occurs at\nlow temperatures where the orbital 2CK effect becomes important, suggesting a\nnegative AHE contribution. The deviation of the scaling agrees with the orbital\n2CK effect in the breakdown temperatures and deviation magnitudes.\n", "  The process $e^+e^- \\to \\pi^0\\gamma$ has been studied in the experiment with\nthe SND detector at the VEPP-2M $e^+e^-$ collider. The $e^+e^- \\to \\pi^0\\gamma$\ncross section has been measured in the center-of-mass energy range from 0.60 to\n1.38 GeV. The cross section is well described by the vector meson dominance\nmodel. From the fit to the cross section data we have determined the branching\nfractions $B(\\rho\\to\\pi^0\\gamma)=(4.20\\pm0.52)\\times10^{-4}$,\n$B(\\omega\\to\\pi^0\\gamma)=(8.88\\pm0.18)\\%$,\n$B(\\phi\\to\\pi^0\\gamma)=(1.367\\pm0.072)\\times10^{-3}$, and the relative phase\nbetween the $\\rho$ and $\\omega$ amplitudes\n$\\varphi_{\\rho}=(-12.7\\pm4.5)^\\circ$. Our data on the process $e^+e^- \\to\n\\pi^0\\gamma$ are the most accurate to date.\n", "  We investigate an ultra-thin film of topological insulator (TI) multilayer as\na model for a three-dimensional (3D) Weyl semimetal. We introduce tunneling\nparameters $t_S$, $t_\\perp$, and $t_D$, where the former two parameters couple\nlayers of the same thin film at small and large momenta, and the latter\nparameter couples neighbouring thin film layers along the $z$-direction. The\nChern number is computed in each topological phase of the system and we find\nthat for $t_S,t_D>0$, the tunneling parameter $t_\\perp$ changes from positive\nto negative as the system transits from Weyl semi-metallic phase to insulating\nphases. We further study the chiral magnetic effect (CME) of the system in the\npresence of a time dependent magnetic field. We compute the low-temperature\ndependence of the chiral magnetic conductivity and show that it captures three\ndistinct phases of the system separated by plateaus. Furthermore, we propose\nand study a 3D lattice model of Porphyrin thin film, an organic material known\nto support topological Frenkel exciton edge states. We show that this model\nexhibits a 3D Weyl semi-metallic phase and also supports a 2D Weyl\nsemi-metallic phase. We further show that this model recovers that of 3D Weyl\nsemimetal in topological insulator thin film multilayer. Thus, paving the way\nfor simulating a 3D Weyl semimetal in topological insulator thin film\nmultilayer. We obtain the surface states (Fermi arcs) in the 3D model and the\nchiral edge states in the 2D model and analyze their topological properties.\n", "  We study a simple model in which the recently reported 750 GeV diphoton\nexcess arises from a composite pseudo Nambu-Goldstone boson---hidden\npion---produced by gluon fusion and decaying into two photons. The model only\nintroduces an extra hidden gauge group at the TeV scale with a vectorlike quark\nin the bifundamental representation of the hidden and standard model gauge\ngroups. We calculate the masses of all the hidden pions and analyze their\nexperimental signatures and constraints. We find that two colored hidden pions\nmust be near the current experimental limits, and hence are probed in the near\nfuture. We study physics of would-be stable particles---the composite states\nthat do not decay purely by the hidden and standard model gauge dynamics---in\ndetail, including constraints from cosmology. We discuss possible theoretical\nstructures above the TeV scale, e.g. conformal dynamics and supersymmetry, and\ntheir phenomenological implications. We also discuss an extension of the\nminimal model in which there is an extra hidden quark that is singlet under the\nstandard model and has a mass smaller than the hidden dynamical scale. This\nprovides two standard model singlet hidden pions that can both be viewed as\ndiphoton/diboson resonances produced by gluon fusion. We discuss several\nscenarios in which these (and other) resonances can be used to explain various\nexcesses seen in the LHC data.\n", "  A radiative natural SUSY spectrum are proposed in the deflected anomaly\nmediation scenario with general messenger-matter interactions. Due to the\ncontributions from the new interactions, positive slepton masses as well as a\nlarge |A_t| term can naturally be obtained with either sign of deflection\nparameter and few messenger species (thus avoid the possible Landau pole\nproblem). In this scenario, in contrast to the ordinary (radiative) natural\nSUSY scenario with under-abundance of dark matter (DM), the DM can be the mixed\nbino-higgsino and have the right relic density. The 125 GeV Higgs mass can also\nbe easily obtained in our scenario. The majority of low EW fine tuning points\ncan be covered by the XENON-1T direct detection experiments.\n", "  We report transverse and longitudinal magneto-transport properties of NbAs2\nsingle crystals. Attributing to the electron-hole compensation, non-saturating\nlarge transverse magnetoresistance reaches up to 8000 at 9 T at 1.8 K with\nmobility around 1 to 2 m^2V^-1S^-1. We present a thorough study of\nangular-dependent Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) quantum oscillations of NbAs2. Three\ndistinct oscillation frequencies are identified. First-principles calculations\nreveal four types of Fermi pockets: electron alpha pocket, hole beta pocket,\nhole gamma pocket and small electron delta pocket. Although the angular\ndependence of alpha, beta and delta agree well with the SdH data, it is unclear\nwhy the gamma pocket is missing in SdH. Negative longitudinal magnetoresistance\nis observed which may be linked to novel topological states in this material,\nalthough systematic study is necessary to ascertain its origin.\n", "  We provide a brane realization of 2d (0,2) Gadde-Gukov-Putrov triality in\nterms of brane brick models. These are Type IIA brane configurations that are\nT-dual to D1-branes over singular toric Calabi-Yau 4-folds. Triality translates\ninto a local transformation of brane brick models, whose simplest\nrepresentative is a cube move. We present explicit examples and construct their\ntriality networks. We also argue that the classical mesonic moduli space of\nbrane brick model theories, which corresponds to the probed Calabi-Yau 4-fold,\nis invariant under triality. Finally, we discuss triality in terms of phase\nboundaries, which play a central role in connecting Calabi-Yau 4-folds to brane\nbrick models.\n", "  Light curves of superhumps and their evolution during superoutbursts are\nanalyzed by decomposing them into their Fourier components, including the\nfundamental mode and the first three overtones. The amplitudes of the\nfundamental mode are found to decrease significantly during superoutburst while\nthose of the overtones remain practically constant. The phases of maxima of the\nfundamental mode {\\it increase} systematically during superoutburst while those\nof the overtones -- systematically {\\it decrease}. The combination of the two\neffects is responsible for the characteristic evolution of superhump light\ncurves: the appearance and growth of the secondary humps and the spurious phase\njumps in the (O-C) diagrams. Two intrepretations are possible. Either that\ninstead of just one superhump period $P_{sh}$ there are four periods $P_k$\nwhich resemble -- but are significantly different from -- the fundamental mode\nand the first three overtones of $P_{sh}$. Or -- more likely -- that those\ntime-dependent phase shifts are genuine.\n", "  A search for Secluded Dark Matter annihilation in the Sun using 2007-2012\ndata of the ANTARES neutrino telescope is presented. Three different cases are\nconsidered: a) detection of dimuons that result from the decay of the mediator,\nor neutrino detection from: b) mediator that decays into a dimuon and, in turn,\ninto neutrinos, and c) mediator that decays directly into neutrinos. As no\nsignificant excess over background is observed, constraints are derived on the\ndark matter mass and the lifetime of the mediator.\n", "  We suggest a multiatom cavity quantum electrodynamics system for the weak\nmagnetic field detection based on Faraday rotation with intracavity\nelectromagnetically induced transparency. Our study demonstrates that the\ncollective coupling between the cavity modes and the atomic ensemble can be\nused to improve the sensitivity. With single probe photon input, the\nsensitivity is inversely proportional to the number of atoms, and the\nsensitivity with 0.7(5)~nT/$\\sqrt{\\rm Hz}$ could be attained. With multiphoton\nmeasurement, our numerical calculations show that the magnetic field\nsensitivity can be improved to 4.7(9)~fT/$\\sqrt{\\rm Hz}$.\n", "  Although progress has been made recently in defining nontrivial uncertainty\nlimits for the SU(2) group, a description of the intermediate states bound by\nthese limits remains lacking. In this paper we enumerate possible uncertainty\nrelations for the SU(2) group that involve all three observables and that are,\nmoreover, invariant under SU(2) transformations. We demonstrate that these\nrelations however, even taken as a group, do not provide sharp, saturable\nbounds. To find sharp bounds, we systematically calculate the variance of the\nSU(2) operators for all pure states belonging to the $N=2$ and $N=3$\npolarisation excitation manifold (corresponding to spin 1 and spin 3/2).\nLastly, and perhaps counter to expectation, we note that even pure states can\nreach the maximum uncertainty limit.\n", "  We have implemented the Centroid Molecular Dynamics scheme (CMD) into the\nGrand Canonical-like version of the Adaptive Resolution Simulation Molecular\nDynamics (GC-AdResS) method. We have tested the implementation on two different\nsystems, liquid parahydrogen at extreme thermodynamic conditions and liquid\nwater at ambient conditions; the reproduction of structural as well as\ndynamical results of reference systems are highly satisfactory. The capability\nof performing GC-AdResS CMD simulations allows for the treatment of a system\ncharacterized by some quantum features and open boundaries. This latter\ncharacteristic not only is of computational convenience, allowing for\nequivalent results of much larger and computationally more expensive systems,\nbut also suggests a tool of analysis so far not explored, that is the\nunambiguous identification of the essential (quantum) degrees of freedom\nrequired for a given property.\n", "  Combining neutrino mass generation and a dark matter candidate in a unified\nmodel has always been intriguing. We revisit the class of R$\\nu$MDM models,\nwhich incorporate minimal dark matter in radiative neutrino mass models based\non the one-loop ultraviolet completions of the Weinberg operator. The\npossibility of an exact accidental $Z_2$ is completely ruled out in this\nscenario. We study the phenomenology of one of the models with an approximate\n$Z_2$ symmetry. In addition to the Standard Model particles, it contains two\nreal scalar quintuplets, one vector- like quadruplet fermion and a fermionic\nquintuplet. The neutral component of the fermionic quintuplet serves as a good\ndark matter candidate which can be tested by the future direct and indirect\ndetection experiments. The constraints from flavor physics and\nelectroweak-scale naturalness are also discussed.\n", "  We explore the possibility that soft gamma-ray repeaters (SGRs) and anomalous\nX-ray pulsars (AXPs) are powered by highly magnetized white dwarfs (B-WDs). We\ntake a sample of SGRs and AXPs and provide the possible parameter space in\nmass, radius, and surface magnetic field based on their observed properties\n(period and its derivative) and the assumption that these sources obey the\nmass-radius relation derived for the B-WDs. The radius and magnetic field of\nB-WDs are adequate to explain energies in SGRs/AXPs as the rotationally powered\nenergy. In addition, B-WDs also adequately explain the perplexing radio\ntransient GCRT J1745-3009 as a white dwarf pulsar. Note that the radius and\nmagnetic fields of B-WDs are neither extreme (unlike of highly magnetized\nneutron stars) nor ordinary (unlike of magnetized white dwarfs, yet following\nthe Chandrasekhar's mass-radius relation (C-WDs)). In order to explain\nSGRs/AXPs, while the highly magnetized neutron stars require an extra,\nobservationally not well established yet, source of energy, the C-WDs predict\nlarge ultra-violet luminosity which is observationally constrained from a\nstrict upper limit. Finally, we provide a set of basic differences between the\nmagnetar and B-WD hypotheses for SGRs/AXPs.\n", "  The present note summarizes the discourse on power counting issues of chiral\nnuclear forces, with an emphasis on renormalization-group invariance. Given its\nintroductory nature, I will lean toward narrating a coherent point of view on\nthe concepts, rather than covering comprehensively the development of chiral\nnuclear forces in different approaches.\n", "  The $10$ GHz microwave conductivity, $\\sigma(T)$ and high field, $222$ GHz\nelectron spin resonance (HF-ESR) of Li$_4$C$_{60}$ fulleride is measured in a\nwide temperature range. We suggest that the majority of ESR active sites and at\nleast some of the charge carriers for $\\sigma(T)$ are electrons bound to a\nsmall concentration of surplus or vacancy ions in the polymer phase. Both\n$\\sigma(T)$ and the ESR line shape depend on ionic motion. A change of the\nactivation energy of $\\sigma(T)$ at $125$ K coincides with the onset of the\nionic DC conductivity. The ESR line shape is determined mainly by Li ionic\nmotion within octahedral voids below $150$ K. At higher temperatures,\nfluctuations due to ionic diffusion change the environment of defects from\naxial to effectively isotropic on the ESR time scale. $\\sigma(T)$ data up to\n$700$ K through the depolymerization transition confirm that the monomeric\nphase of Li$_4$C$_{60}$ is a metal.\n", "  The electromagnetic structure of $^{140}$Sm was studied in a low-energy\nCoulomb excitation experiment with a radioactive ion beam from the REX-ISOLDE\nfacility at CERN. The $2^+$ and $4^+$ states of the ground-state band and a\nsecond $2^+$ state were populated by multi-step excitation. The analysis of the\ndifferential Coulomb excitation cross sections yielded reduced transition\nprobabilities between all observed states and the spectroscopic quadrupole\nmoment for the $2_1^+$ state. The experimental results are compared to\nlarge-scale shell model calculations and beyond-mean-field calculations based\non the Gogny D1S interaction with a five-dimensional collective Hamiltonian\nformalism. Simpler geometric and algebraic models are also employed to\ninterpret the experimental data. The results indicate that $^{140}$Sm shows\nconsiderable $\\gamma$ softness, but in contrast to earlier speculation no signs\nof shape coexistence at low excitation energy. This work sheds more light on\nthe onset of deformation and collectivity in this mass region.\n", "  (abridged) The large-scale distribution of galaxies is generally analyzed\nusing the two-point correlation function. However, this statistic does not\ncapture the topology of the distribution, and it is necessary to resort to\nhigher order correlations to break degeneracies. We demonstrate that an\nalternate approach using network analysis can discriminate between\ntopologically different distributions that have similar two-point correlations.\nWe investigate two galaxy point distributions, one produced by a cosmological\nsimulation and the other by a L\\'evy walk. For the cosmological simulation, we\nadopt the redshift $z = 0.58$ slice from Illustris (Vogelsberger et al. 2014A)\nand select galaxies with stellar masses greater than $10^8$$M_\\odot$. The two\npoint correlation function of these simulated galaxies follows a single\npower-law, $\\xi(r) \\sim r^{-1.5}$. Then, we generate L\\'evy walks matching the\ncorrelation function and abundance with the simulated galaxies. We find that,\nwhile the two simulated galaxy point distributions have the same abundance and\ntwo point correlation function, their spatial distributions are very different;\nmost prominently, \\emph{filamentary structures}, absent in L\\'evy fractals. To\nquantify these missing topologies, we adopt network analysis tools and measure\ndiameter, giant component, and transitivity from networks built by a\nconventional friends-of-friends recipe with various linking lengths. Unlike the\nabundance and two point correlation function, these network quantities reveal a\nclear separation between the two simulated distributions; therefore, the galaxy\ndistribution simulated by Illustris is not a L\\'evy fractal quantitatively. We\nfind that the described network quantities offer an efficient tool for\ndiscriminating topologies and for comparing observed and theoretical\ndistributions.\n", "  Semiclassical periodic-orbit theory (POT) is applied to the physics of\nnuclear structures, with the use of a realistic nuclear mean-field model given\nby the radial power-law potential. Evolution of deformed shell structures,\nwhich are responsible for various nuclear deformations, are clearly understood\nfrom the contribution of short classical periodic orbits (POs). Bifurcations of\nshort POs, which imply underlying local dynamical symmetry, play significant\nrole there. The effect of the spin degree of freedom is also investigated in\nrelevance to the pseudospin symmetry in spherical nuclei and the prolate-oblate\nasymmetry in shell structures of nuclei with quadrupole-type deformations.\n", "  The site reduction of U(1) lattice gauge theory is used to model the 0-branes\nin the dual theory. The reduced theory is the 1D plane-rotator model of the\nangle-valued coordinates on discrete world-line. The energy spectrum is\nobtained exactly via the transfer-matrix method, with a minimum in the lowest\nenergy as a direct consequence of compact nature of coordinates. Below the\ncritical coupling $g_c=1.125$ and temperature $T_c=0.335$ the system undergoes\na first order phase transition between coexistent phases with lower and higher\ngauge couplings. The possible relation between the model and the proposed role\nfor magnetic monopoles in confinement mechanism based on dual Meissner effect\nis pointed.\n", "  We present the results of a search for elastic scattering from galactic dark\nmatter in the form of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) in the 4-30\nGeV/$c^2$ mass range. We make use of a 582 kg-day fiducial exposure from an\narray of 800 g Germanium bolometers equipped with a set of interleaved\nelectrodes with full surface coverage. We searched specifically for $\\sim\n2.5-20$ keV nuclear recoils inside the detector fiducial volume. As an\nillustration the number of observed events in the search for 5 (resp. 20)\nGeV/$c^2$ WIMPs are 9 (resp. 4), compared to an expected background of 6.1\n(resp. 1.4). A 90% CL limit of $4.3\\times 10^{-40}$ cm$^2$ (resp. $9.4\\times\n10^{-44}$ cm$^2$) is set on the spin-independent WIMP-nucleon scattering\ncross-section for 5 (resp. 20) GeV/$c^2$ WIMPs. This result represents a\n41-fold improvement with respect to the previous EDELWEISS-II low-mass WIMP\nsearch for 7 GeV/$c^2$ WIMPs. The derived constraint is in tension with hints\nof WIMP signals from some recent experiments, thus confirming results obtained\nwith different detection techniques.\n", "  We study the realization of supergroup gauge theories using negative branes\nin string theory. We show that negative branes are intimately connected with\nthe possibility of timelike compactification and exotic spacetime signatures\npreviously studied by Hull. Isolated negative branes dynamically generate a\nchange in spacetime signature near their worldvolumes, and are related by\nstring dualities to a smooth M-theory geometry with closed timelike curves.\nUsing negative D3 branes, we show that $SU(0|N)$ supergroup theories are\nholographically dual to an exotic variant of type IIB string theory on\n$dS_{3,2} \\times \\bar S^5$, for which the emergent dimensions are timelike.\nUsing branes, mirror symmetry and Nekrasov's instanton calculus, all of which\nagree, we derive the Seiberg-Witten curve for $\\mathcal N=2 ~SU(N|M)$ gauge\ntheories. Together with our exploration of holography and string dualities for\nnegative branes, this suggests that supergroup gauge theories may be\nnon-perturbatively well-defined objects, though several puzzles remain.\n", "  According to evolutionary game theory, cooperation in public goods games is\neliminated by free-riders, yet in nature, cooperation is ubiquitous. Artificial\nmodels resolve this contradiction via the mechanism of network reciprocity.\nHowever, existing research only addresses pre-existing networks and does not\nspecifically consider their origins. Further, much work has focused on\nscale-free networks and so pre-supposes attachment mechanisms which may not\nexist in nature. We present a coevolutionary model of public goods games in\nnetworks, growing by random attachment, from small founding populations of\nsimple agents. The model demonstrates the emergence of cooperation in\nmoderately heterogeneous networks, regardless of original founders' behaviour,\nand absent higher cognitive abilities such as recognition or memory. It may\nthus illustrate a more general mechanism for the evolution of cooperation, from\nearly origins, in minimally cognitive organisms. It is the first example of a\nmodel explaining cooperation in public goods games on growing networks.\n", "  The linear motor driving the target for the Muon Ionisation Cooling\nExperiment has been redesigned to improve its reliability and performance. A\nnew coil-winding technique is described which produces better magnetic\nalignment and improves heat transport out of the windings. Improved\nfield-mapping has allowed the more precise construction to be demonstrated, and\nan enhanced controller exploits the full features of the hardware, enabling\nincreased acceleration and precision. The new user interface is described and\nanalysis of performance data to monitor friction is shown to allow quality\ncontrol of bearings and a measure of the ageing of targets during use.\n", "  The robustness of connectivity and the efficiency of paths are incompatible\nin many real networks. We propose a self-organization mechanism for\nincrementally generating onion-like networks with positive degree-degree\ncorrelations whose robustness is nearly optimal. As a spatial extension of the\ngeneration model based on cooperative copying and adding shortcut, we show that\nthe growing networks become more robust and efficient through enhancing the\nonion-like topological structure on a space. The reasonable constraint for\nlocating nodes on the perimeter in typical surface growth as a self-propagation\ndoes not affect these properties of the tolerance and the path length.\nMoreover, the robustness can be recovered in the random growth damaged by\ninsistent sequential attacks even without any remedial measures.\n", "  The system of a cold atomic gas in an optical lattice is governed by two\nfactors: nonlinearity originating from the interparticle interaction, and the\nperiodicity of the system set by the lattice. The high level of controllability\nassociated with such an arrangement allows for the study of the competition and\ninterplay between these two, and gives rise to a whole range of interesting and\nrich nonlinear effects. This review covers the basic idea and overview of such\nnonlinear phenomena, especially those corresponding to extended states. This\nincludes \"swallowtail\" loop structures of the energy band, Bloch states with\nmultiple periodicity, and those in \"nonlinear lattices\", i.e., systems with the\nnonlinear interaction term itself being a periodic function in space.\n", "  High-quality collections of Type II supernova (SN) light curves are scarce\nbecause they evolve for hundreds of days, making follow-up observations time\nconsuming and often extending over multiple observing seasons. In light of\nthese difficulties, the diversity of SNe II is not fully understood. Here we\npresent ultraviolet and optical photometry of 12 SNe II monitored by the Las\nCumbres Observatory Global Telescope Network (LCOGT) during 2013-2014, and\ncompare them with previously studied SNe having well-sampled light curves. We\nexplore SN II diversity by searching for correlations between the slope of the\nlinear light-curve decay after maximum light (historically used to divide SNe\nII into IIL and IIP) and other measured physical properties. While SNe IIL are\nfound to be on average more luminous than SNe IIP, SNe IIL do not appear to\nsynthesize more 56Ni than SNe IIP. Finally, optical nebular spectra obtained\nfor several SNe in our sample are found to be consistent with models of red\nsupergiant progenitors in the 12-16 Msun range. Consequently, SNe IIL appear\nnot to account for the deficit of massive red supergiants as SN II progenitors.\n", "  An upgraded concept of solvability of Schr\\\"{o}dinger-type equations is\nproposed. In a broader methodical context of non-perturbative quantum theory\nthe innovation involves potentials which are piece-wise analytic yielding\ndifferential equations solvable in terms of special functions. In our\nillustrative example, Whittaker functions are employed and a single point of\nnon-analyticity is admitted in the origin. In a symbolic-manipulation-based\npractical implementation of the method a serendipitous advantage of the\nconstruction of bound states is found in the both-sided nature of the numerical\nlocalization of their energies.\n", "  Motivated by recent developments of BTZ black holes and interesting results\nof massive gravity, we investigate massive BTZ black holes in the presence of\nMaxwell and Born-Infeld (BI) electrodynamics. We study geometrical properties\nsuch as type of singularity and asymptotical behavior as well as thermodynamic\nstructure of the solutions through canonical ensemble. We show that despite the\nexistence of massive term, obtained solutions are asymptotically (a)dS and have\na curvature singularity at the origin. Then, we regard varying cosmological\nconstant and examine the Van der Waals like behavior of the solutions in\nextended phase space. In addition, we employ geometrical thermodynamic\napproaches and show that using Weinhold, Ruppeiner and Quevedo metrics leads to\nexistence of ensemble dependency while HPEM metric yields consistent picture.\nFor neutral solutions, it will be shown that generalization to massive gravity\nleads to the presence of non-zero temperature and heat capacity for vanishing\nhorizon radius. Such behavior is not observed for linearly charged solutions\nwhile generalization to nonlinearly one recovers this property.\n", "  We present a method to calculate the exciton spectra of all direct\nsemiconductors with a complex valence band structure. The Schr\\\"odinger\nequation is solved using a complete basis set with Coulomb Sturmian functions.\nThis method also allows for the computation of oscillator strengths. Here we\napply this method to investigate the impact of the valence band structure of\ncuprous oxide $\\left(\\mathrm{Cu_{2}O}\\right)$ on the yellow exciton spectrum.\nResults differ from those in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 115, 027402 (2015)]; the\ndifferences are discussed and explained. The difference between the second and\nthird Luttinger parameter can be determined by comparisons with experiments,\nhowever, the evaluation of all three Luttinger parameters is not uniquely\npossible. Our results are consistent with band structure calculations.\nConsidering also a finite momentum $\\hbar K$ of the center of mass, we show\nthat the large $K$-dependent line splitting observed for the $1S$ exciton state\n[Phys. Rev. Lett. 91, 107401 (2003)] is not related to an exchange interaction\nbut rather to the complex valence band structure of $\\mathrm{Cu_{2}O}$.\n", "  We report the operation of a cold-atom inertial sensor which continuously\ncaptures the rotation signal. Using a joint interrogation scheme, where we\nsimultaneously prepare a cold-atom source and operate an atom interferometer\n(AI) enables us to eliminate the dead times. We show that such continuous\noperation improves the short-term sensitivity of AIs, and demonstrate a\nrotation sensitivity of $100\\ \\text{nrad.s}^{-1}.\\text{Hz}^{-1/2}$ in a\ncold-atom gyroscope of $11 \\ \\text{cm}^2$ Sagnac area. We also demonstrate a\nrotation stability of $1 \\ \\text{nrad.s}^{-1}$ at $10^4$ s of integration time,\nwhich establishes the record for atomic gyroscopes. The continuous operation of\ncold-atom inertial sensors will enable to benefit from the full sensitivity\npotential of large area AIs, determined by the quantum noise limit.\n", "  The Higgs boson branching ratio into vector bosons is sensitive to the decay\nwidths of those vector bosons because they are produced with at least one boson\nsignificantly off-shell. Gamma(H to V V ) is approximately proportional to the\nproduct of the Higgs boson coupling and the vector boson width. Gamma Z is well\nknown, but Gamma W gives an uncertainty on Gamma(H to W W ) which is not\nnegligible. The ratio of branching ratios, BR(H to W W )/BR(H to ZZ) measured\nby a combination of ATLAS and CMS at LHC is used herein to extract a width for\nthe W boson of Gamma W = 1.8+0.4-0.3 GeV by assuming Standard Model couplings\nof the Higgs bosons. This dependence of the branching ratio on Gamma W is not\ndiscussed in most Higgs boson coupling analyses.\n", "  Fast Radio Bursts are millisecond bursts of radio radiation at frequencies of\nabout 1 GHz, recently discovered in pulsar surveys. They have not yet been\ndefinitively identified with any other astronomical object or phenomenon. The\nbursts are strongly dispersed, indicating passage through a high column density\nof low density plasma. The most economical interpretation is that this is the\ninterglactic medium, indicating that FRB are at \"cosmological\" distances with\nredshifts in the range 0.3--1.3. Their inferred brightness temperatures are as\nhigh as $10^{37\\,\\circ}$K, implying coherent emission by \"bunched\" charges, as\nin radio pulsars. I review the astronomical sites, objects and emission\nprocesses that have been proposed as the origin of FRB, with particular\nattention to Soft Gamma Repeaters and giant pulsar pulses.\n", "  We review theoretical aspects of the studies on the recently discovered BiCh2\n(Ch=chalcogen) based superconductors. We first focus on the electronic band\nstructure, the Fermi surface and their correlation with the lattice structure.\nWe then discuss the phonon features and the issue of the lattice instability.\nFinally, we survey the phonon-mediated as well as the unconventional pairing\nmechanisms that have been proposed so far.\n", "  The near-wake of a vertical-axis cross-flow turbine (CFT) was modeled\nnumerically via blade-resolved $k$-$\\omega$ SST and Spalart-Allmaras RANS\nmodels in two and three dimensions. Results for each case are compared with\nexperimental measurements of the turbine shaft power, overall drag, mean\nvelocity, turbulence kinetic energy, and momentum transport terms in the\nnear-wake at one diameter downstream. It was shown that 2-D simulations\noverpredict turbine loading and do not resolve mean vertical momentum\ntransport, which plays an important role in the near-wake's momentum balance.\nThe 3-D simulations fared better at predicting performance, with the\nSpalart-Allmaras model predictions being closest to the experiments. The SST\nmodel more accurately predicted the turbulence kinetic energy while the\nSpalart-Allmaras model more closely matched the momentum transport terms in the\nnear-wake. These results show the potential of blade-resolved RANS as a design\ntool and a way to \"extrapolate\" experimental flow field measurements.\n", "  Rise in superconducting critical temperature Tc more than two times\n(exceeding 20 K) is discov- ered in point-contacts created between\niron-chalcogenide FeSe single crystal and Cu. The possible reasons of such Tc\nincrease in point-contacts are discussed. The most probable cause for this may\nbe the interfacial carriers doping and/or interfacial enhanced electron-phonon\ninteraction.\n", "  The next-to-leading order black-body radiation(BBR) shift to atomic\nenergy-levels, namely $ (Z\\alpha)^2\\alpha T^2/m $ correction, was studied by\nusing the nonrelativistic quantum electrodynamics(NRQED). We also estimate the\none-loop contribution of quadrupole and the two-loop contributions of BBR-shift\nof the thermal(real) photon. These corrections have not been investigated\nbefore. The order of magnitude BBR-shift indicates the one-loop contribution of\nquadrupole is stronger than the previous result. And the two-loop contribution\nof BBR-shift of the thermal(real) photon is tiny, but this next-to-leading\norder BBR-shift may be as significant as the leading order in the\nmulti-electron atoms or cold ones.\n", "  Simulating a network of Ising spins with physical systems is now emerging as\na promising approach for solving mathematically intractable problems. Here we\nreport a large-scale network of artificial spins based on degenerate optical\nparametric oscillators (DOPO), paving the way towards a photonic Ising machine\ncapable of solving difficult combinatorial optimization problems. We generated\n>10,000 time-division-multiplexed DOPOs using dual-pump four-wave mixing (FWM)\nin a highly nonlinear fibre (HNLF) placed in a fibre cavity. Using those DOPOs,\na one-dimensional (1D) Ising model was simulated by introducing\nnearest-neighbour optical coupling. We observed the formation of spin domains\nand found that the domain size diverged near the DOPO threshold, which suggests\nthat the DOPO network can simulate the behavior of low-temperature Ising spins.\n", "  The total nuclear cross-section Qtot(E) resulting from the interaction of\nprotons with nuclei is decomposed in 3 different contributions: 1. elastic\nscatter at the complete nucleus, which adopts a part of the proton kinetic\nenergy; 2. inelastic scatter at a nucleus, which changes its quantum numbers by\nvibrations, rotations, transition to highly excited states; 3. proper nuclear\nreactions with change of the mass and/or charge number. Then different\nparticles leave the hit nucleus (neutrons, protons, etc.), which is now\nreferred to as 'heavy recoil' nucleus. The scatter parts of Qtot(E) according\nto points 1 and 2 can be removed by a deconvolution acting at Qtot(E) in the\nenergy space. The typical nuclear reaction channels are mainly characterized by\nresonances of a reduced cross-section function Qred(E). The procedure is\napplied to cross-sections of therapeutic protons and also to Cs55137 as an\nexample with technical relevance (transmutations with the goal to drastically\nreduce its half-time).\n", "  We employ a combination of pseudopotential and all-electron density\nfunctional calculations, to relate the structure of defects in supercells to\nthe isomer shifts and quadrupole splittings observed in M\\\"ossbauer\nspectroscopy experiments. The methodology is comprehensively reviewed and\napplied to the technologically relevant case of iron-related defects in\nsilicon, and to other group-IV hosts to a lesser degree. Investigated defects\ninclude interstitial and substitutional iron, iron-boron pairs, iron-vacancy\nand iron-divacancy. We find that in general, agreement between the calculations\nand M\\\"ossbauer data is within a 10% error bar. Nonetheless, we show that the\nmethodology can be used to make accurate assignments, including to separate\npeaks of similar defects in slightly different environments.\n", "  The city of Honolulu, Hawaii is currently planning and developing a new rail\ntransit system. While Honolulu has supportive density and topography for rail\ntransit, questions remain about its ability to effectively integrate urban\ndesign and accessibility across the system. Every transit trip begins and ends\nwith a walking trip from origins and to destinations: transportation planning\nmust account for pedestrian safety, comfort, and access. Ildefons Cerda's 19th\ncentury utopian plan for Barcelona's Eixample district produced a renowned,\nlivable urban form. The Eixample, with its well-integrated rail transit, serves\nas a model of urban design, land use, transportation planning, and\npedestrian-scaled streets working in synergy to produce accessibility. This\nstudy discusses the urban form of Honolulu and the history and planning of its\nnew rail transit system. Then it reviews the history of Cerda's plan for the\nEixample and discusses its urban form and performance today. Finally it draws\nseveral lessons from Barcelona's urban design, accessibility, and rail transit\nplanning and critically discusses their applicability to policy and design in\nHonolulu. This discussion is situated within wider debates around livable\ncities and social justice as it contributes several form and design lessons to\nthe livability and accessibility literature while identifying potential\nconcerns with privatization and displacement.\n", "  The physics of gravitational wave and its detection in the recent experiment\nby the LIGO collaboration is discussed in simple terms for a general audience.\nThe main article is devoid of any mathematics, but an appendix is included for\ninquisitive readers where essential mathematics for general theory of\nrelativity and gravitational waves are given.\n", "  We study the generation of the wakefields by means of the high energy\nradiation of pulsars. The problem is considered in the framework of a one\ndimensional approach. We linearize the set of governing equations consisting of\nthe momentum equation, continuity equation an Poisson equation and show that a\nwavelike structure will inevitably arise relatively close to the pulsar.\n", "  We propose an alternative scheme for nonreciprocal light propagation in two\ncoupled cavities system, in which a two-level quantum emitter is coupled to one\nof the optical microcavities. For the case of parity-time (\\textrm{PT}) system\n(i.e., active-passive coupled cavities system), the cavity gain can\nsignificantly enhance the optical nonlinearity induced by the interaction\nbetween a quantum emitter and cavity field beyond weak-excitation\napproximation. The giant optical nonlinearity results in the non-lossy\nnonreciprocal light propagation with high isolation ratio in proper parameters\nrange. In addition, our calculations show that nonreciprocal light propagation\nwill not be affected by the unstable output field intensity caused by optical\nbistability and we can even switch directions of nonreciprocal light\npropagation by appropriately adjusting the system parameters.\n", "  We report high spatial resolution i' band imaging of the multiple T Tauri\nsystem LkH$\\alpha$ 262/LkH$\\alpha$ 263 obtained during the first commissioning\nperiod of the Adaptive Optics Lucky Imager (AOLI) at the 4.2 m William Herschel\nTelescope, using its Lucky Imaging mode. AOLI images have provided photometry\nfor each of the two components LkH$\\alpha$ 263 A and B (0.41 arcsec separation)\nand marginal evidence for an unresolved binary or a disc in LkH$\\alpha$ 262.\nThe AOLI data combined with previously available and newly obtained optical and\ninfrared imaging show that the three components of LkH$\\alpha$ 263 are\nco-moving, that there is orbital motion in the AB pair, and, remarkably, that\nLkH$\\alpha$ 262-263 is a common proper motion system with less than 1 mas/yr\nrelative motion. We argue that this is a likely five-component gravitationally\nbounded system. According to BT-settl models the mass of each of the five\ncomponents is close to 0.4 M$_{\\odot}$ and the age is in the range 1-2 Myr. The\npresence of discs in some of the components offers an interesting opportunity\nto investigate the formation and evolution of discs in the early stages of\nmultiple very low-mass systems. In particular, we provide tentative evidence\nthat the disc in 263C could be coplanar with the orbit of 263AB.\n", "  We show that one-variable reductions of the Pfaff-Toda integrable hierarchy\nin the dispersionless limit are described by a system of coupled elliptic\nL\\\"owner (Komatu-Goluzin) equations.\n", "  Tungsten trioxide (WO$_3$) is a paradigmatic electrochromic material, whose\npeculiar optical properties in the presence of oxygen vacancies or intercalated\nalkali atoms have been observed and investigated for a long time. In this paper\nwe propose a rationalization of experiments based on first-principles\ncalculations of optical and electrical properties of oxygen deficient (reduced)\nWO$_3$. Our approach is based on a parameter-free dielectric-dependent hybrid\ndensity functional methodology, used in combination with the charge transition\nlevels formalism, for studying excitation mechanisms in the presence of\ndefects. Our results indicate that oxygen vacancies lead to a different physics\nin $\\gamma$-monoclinic WO$_3$, depending on the orientation of the W-O-W chain\nwhere the vacancy is created, thus evidencing strong anisotropic effects rooted\nin the peculiar structural properties of the original nondefective monoclinic\ncell. Different types of oxygen vacancies can hence be classified on the basis\nof the calculated ground state properties, electronic structure, and\nexcitation/emission energies, giving a satisfactory explanation to a range of\nexperimental observations made on oxygen deficient WO$_3$.\n", "  Particle acceleration by cascading Alfven wave turbulence was suggested\n(Eichler, 1979b) as being responsible for energetic particle populations in\n$^3$He-rich solar flares. In particular, it was noted that the damping of the\nturbulence by the tail of the particle distribution in rigidity naturally leads\nto dramatic enhancement of pre-accelerated species - as $^3$He is posited to be\n- and superheavy elements. The subsequent detection of large enrichment of\nultraheavies, relative to iron, has apparently confirmed this prediction,\nlending support to the original idea. It is shown here that this picture could\nbe somewhat sharpened by progress in understanding the 3-dimensional\ngeometrical details of cascading Alfven turbulence (Sridhar and Goldreich,\n1995). The mechanism may be relevant in other astrophysical environments where\nthe source of turbulence is non-magnetic, such as clusters of galaxies.\n", "  We propose an experimental test of the gravitational interaction with\nantimatter by measuring the branching fraction of the CP~violating decay\n$K_\\mathrm{L} \\to \\pi^{+} \\pi^{-}$ in space. We show that at the altitude of\nthe International Space Station, gravitational effects may change the level of\nCP~violation such that a 5$\\sigma$ discrimination may be obtained by collecting\nthe $K_\\mathrm{L}$ produced by the cosmic proton flux within a few years.\n", "  Filtered backpropagation (FBPP) is a well-known technique used for\nDiffraction Tomography (DT). For accurate reconstruction of a complex image\nusing FBPP, full $360^{\\circ}$ angular coverage is necessary. However, it has\nbeen shown that using some inherent redundancies in projection data in a\ntomographic setup, accurate reconstruction is still possible with $270^{\\circ}$\ncoverage which is called the minimal-scan angle range. This can be done by\napplying weighing functions (or filters) on projection data of the object to\neliminate the redundancies and accurately reconstruct the image from this lower\nangular coverage. This paper demonstrates procedures to generate many general\nclasses of these weighing filters. These are all equivalent at $270^{\\circ}$\ncoverage but would perform differently at lower angular coverages and under\npresence of noise. This paper does a comparative analysis of different filters\nwhen angular coverage is lower than minimal-scan angle of $270^{\\circ}$.\nSimulation studies have been done to find optimum weight filters for\nsub-minimal angular coverage. The optimum weights can generate images\ncomparable to a full $360^{\\circ}$ coverage FBPP reconstruction. Performance of\nthese in presence of noise is also analyzed. These algorithms are capable of\nreconstructing almost distortionless complex images even at angular coverages\nof $200^{\\circ}$.\n", "  We revisit the problem of modulation instability (MI) in optical fibers,\nincluding higher-order dispersion terms, self-steepening, and Raman response.\nWe derive expressions for the MI gain and use them to explore the role of\nself-steepening towards a high-power limit. We show that, contrary to common\nwisdom, there is a pump power level that maximizes the MI gain. Further\nincreasing the power not only diminishes the gain, but eventually makes it\ndisappear. We believe these findings to be of special relevance, for instance,\nwhen applied to the generation of supercontinuum in the mid and far infrared\nbands. Finally, numerical simulations confirming our analytical results are\npresented.\n", "  We report on the amplification of an optical vortex beam carrying orbital\nangular momentum via induced narrow Raman gain in an ensemble of cold cesium\natoms. A 20\\% single-pass Raman gain of a weak vortex signal field is observed\nwith a spectral width of order of 1 MHz, much smaller than the natural width,\ndemonstrating that the amplification process preserves the phase structure of\nthe vortex beam. The gain is observed in the degenerated two-level system\nassociated with the hyperfine transition $6S_{1/2}(F=3)\\leftrightarrow\n6P_{3/2}(F^{\\prime}=2)$ of cesium. Our experimental observations are explained\nwith a simple theoretical model based on a three-level $\\Lambda$ system\ninteracting coherently with the weak Laguerre-Gauss field and a strong coupling\nfield, including an incoherent pumping rate between the two degenerate\nground-states.\n", "  In our Galaxy, star formation occurs in a variety of environments, with a\nlarge fraction of stars formed in clusters hosting massive stars. OB stars have\nan important feedback on the evolution of protoplanetary disks around nearby\nyoung stars and likely on the process of planet formation occurring in them.\nThe nearby massive association Cygnus OB2 is an outstanding laboratory to study\nthis feedback. It is the closest massive association to our Sun, and hosts\nhundreds of massive stars and thousands of low mass members. In this paper, we\nanalyze the spatial variation of the disk fraction in Cygnus OB2 and we study\nits correlation with the local values of Far and Extreme ultraviolet radiation\nfields and the local stellar surface density. We present definitive evidence\nthat disks are more rapidly dissipated in the regions of the association\ncharacterized by intense local UV field and large stellar density. In\nparticular, the FUV radiation dominates disks dissipation timescales in the\nproximity (i.e. within 0.5 pc) of the O stars. In the rest of the association,\nEUV photons potentially induce a significant mass loss from the irradiated\ndisks across the entire association, but the efficiency of this process is\nreduced at increasing distances from the massive stars due to absorption by the\nintervening intracluster material. We find that disk dissipation due to close\nstellar encounters is negligible in Cygnus OB2, and likely to have affected 1%\nor fewer of the stellar population. Disk dissipation is instead dominated by\nphotoevaporation. We also compare our results to what has been found in other\nyoung clusters with different massive populations, concluding that massive\nassociations like Cygnus OB2 are potentially hostile to protoplanetary disks,\nbut that the environments where disks can safely evolve in planetary systems\nare likely quite common in our Galaxy.\n", "  In 2001 the book \"Die partiell konventional, partiell empirisch bestimmte\nRealit\\\"at physikalischer RaumZeiten\" was published by K\\\"onigshausen &\nNeumann, with a volume of more than 400 pages. It was written by Annette Garbe.\nThe English translation might be: \"The Partial Conventionally, Partial\nEmpirically Determined Reality of Physical Space-Times.\" In the following\nreview it is argued that Garbe's approach comes very close to Michael\nFriedman's contemporary defense of the relativized a priori. Whereas Friedman's\nanalysis of the role of conventional and constitutive principles in the theory\nof relativity initiated much discussion in the literature, Garbe's defense of\n\"partial determination\" has been ignored by the scientific community. This is\nentirely unjust due to her highly original re-discovery of Ludwig Lange.\n", "  As neutrinos become a significant background for projected dark matter\nexperiments, the community will become concerned with determining if events\ncounted in a dark matter experiment are good dark matter candidates or\nlow-energy neutrinos from astrophysical sources. We investigate the feasibility\nof using neutrino-electron scattering in a terrestrial detector medium as a\nmeans to determine the flight direction of the original, low-energy solar\nneutrino.Using leading-order weak interactions in the Standard Model and\nconstrains from energy and momentum conservation, we developed a simple\nsimulation that suggests that 68% of the time the ejected electron would be\nwithin 0.99 radians of the incident neutrino's direction. This suggests that it\nmay be fruitful to pursue low-energy neutrino detection capability that can\nutilize such ejected electrons.\n", "  Low Temperature Cofired Ceramics (LTCC) has been a popular multi layer\nceramic (MCM) packaging material for many electronic applications. The main\nadvantage with LTCC would be its ability to embed a major part of the\nelectronic circuit within itself, apart from its enhanced RF functionality as\nagainst many lossy materials used. The advantages of LTCC in terms of frequency\nresponse, cost, ease of fabrication, etc over many other packaging materials\nare presented. The applicability of LTCC as a packaging material, circuit\nmounting material, substrate material or a base material for micro devices is\ndiscussed. Switches and filters fabricated on LTCC as a substrate are presented\nand their enhanced functionality is shown. Planar switches and RF MEMS switches\non LTCC are discussed with regard to their isolation, insertion losses, return\nlosses, repeatability, quality factor, parasitic effects and frequency\nresponse. Concern is also shown to parameters like actuation voltages,\nactuation times and complexity of fabrication. The parameters studied with\ndesign and fabrication of filters is also discussed, like Q factor, dispersive\neffects, limits on frequencies, etc. Discussion is also done with regard to\nLTCC as a base material for MEMS sensors and actuators and the performance\nvariables of the same. Fabrication process parameters are presented. The\nimportant issue of feasibility of integration with microelectronic integrated\ncircuitry is discussed and its effects are shown.\n", "  We construct $P(phi)_1$-processes indexed by the full time-line, separately\nderived from the functional integral representations of the classical Nelson\nmodel and relativistic Nelson model in quantum field theory. Associated with\nthese processes we define a martingale which, under proper scaling, allows to\nobtain a central limit theorem for additive functionals of the two processes.\nWe show a number of examples by choosing specific functionals related to\nparticle-field operators.\n", "  With Geant4 Version 10.0, released in December 2013, one of the most widely\nused Monte-Carlo codes has been ported to take full advantage of multi- and\nmany-core CPUs thanks to the introduction of event-level parallelism via\nmultithreading. In this paper we review recent developments to allow for a\nbetter integration of parallel Geant4 jobs with external libraries. We have\nchosen to develop examples using the popular Intel Threading Building Block\n(for short TBB) as an alternative parallelization approach to the native Geant4\nPOSIX. To simplify the scaling of a Geant4 application across nodes on a\ncluster we are improving the support of MPI in Geant4. In particular it is now\npossible to run an hybrid MPI/MT application that uses MPI to scale across\nnodes and MT to scale across cores. %The recent developments allow users to\neasily implement parallel application resources that scale on a very large\nnumber of nodes and cores typical of HPC resources.\n", "  We employ a five-orbital tight-binding model to develop the mean field\nsolution for various possible spin density wave states in the\niron-chalcogenides. The quasiparticle interference (QPI) technique is applied\nto detect signatures of these states due to scatterings arising from\nnon-magnetic impurities. Apart from the experimentally observed double striped\nstructure with ordering vector $(\\pi/2,\\pi/2)$, the QPI method is investigated\nfor the extended-stripe as well as the orthogonal double stripe phase. We\ndiscuss QPI as a possible tool to detect and classify various magnetic\nstructures with different electronic structure reconstruction within framework\nof the Fe$_{1+y}$Te compound.\n", "  The low rectification ratio limits the application of thermal rectifiers. In\nthis paper, it is found that a series circuit of thermal rectifiers in\nasymmetric graphene/graphene phononic crystal (GPnC) structures can improve\nrectification significantly. The simulations by using non-equilibrium molecular\ndynamics (NEMD) are performed. Moreover, the size effect on thermal\nrectification is also studied and discussed.\n", "  There has recently been considerable interest in using a nonstandard\npiecewise approximation to formulate fractional order differential equations as\ndifference equations that describe the same dynamical behaviour and are more\namenable to a dynamical systems analysis. Unfortunately, due to mistakes in the\nfundamental papers, the difference equations formulated through this process do\nnot capture the dynamics of the fractional order equations. We show that the\ncorrect application of this nonstandard piecewise approximation leads to a one\nparameter family of fractional order differential equations that converges to\nthe original equation as the parameter tends to zero. A closed formed solution\nexists for each member of this family and leads to the formulation of a\ndifference equation that is of increasing order as time steps are taken. Whilst\nthis does not lead to a simplified dynamical analysis it does lead to a\nnumerical method for solving the fractional order differential equation. The\nmethod is shown to be equivalent to a quadrature based method, despite the fact\nthat it has not been derived from a quadrature. The method can be implemented\nwith non-uniform time steps. An example is provided showing that the difference\nequation can correctly capture the dynamics of the underlying fractional\ndifferential equation.\n", "  As one of the paradigmatic models of non-equilibrium systems, the asymmetric\nsimple exclusion process (ASEP) has been widely used to study many physical,\nchemical, and biological systems. The ASEP shows a range of nontrivial\nmacroscopic phenomena, among which, the spontaneous symmetry breaking has\ngained much attention. Nevertheless, as a basic problem, it has been\ncontroversial that whether there exist one or two symmetry-broken phases in the\nASEP. Based on mean field analysis and current minimization principle, this\npaper demonstrates that one of the broken-symmetry phases does not exist in a\nbidirectional two-lane ASEP with narrow entrances. Moreover, an exponential\ndecay feature is observed, which has been used to predict phase boundary in the\nthermodynamic limit. Our findings might be generalized to other ASEP models and\nthus deepen the understanding of the spontaneous symmetry breaking in\nnon-equilibrium systems.\n", "  In this paper, we performed four modifications on the solar still, as (A)\nadding the graphite nanoparticles, (B) the graphite nanoparticles together with\nthe phase change material (PCM), (C) the graphite nanoparticles together with\nglass film cooling, and (D) graphite nanoparticles with both PCM and glass film\ncooling. The effects of modifications are measured and compared with each\nother. The productivities of modified (A), (B), (C), and (D) solar stills are\nenhanced by about 50.28%, 65.00%, 56.15% and 73.80%, respectively, as compared\nwith the conventional solar still. The influences of saline water depths on the\nperformance of modifications (A) and (B) are also considered. Results revealed\nthat the best output yield is obtained for 0.5cm water depth for all solar\nstills.\n", "  Amplitude amplification is a central tool used in Grover's quantum search\nalgorithm and has been used in various forms in numerous quantum algorithms\nsince then. It has been shown to completely eliminate one-sided error of\nquantum search algorithms where input is accessed in the form of black-box\nqueries. We generalize amplitude amplification for two-sided error quantum\nalgorithm for decision problems in the familiar form where input is accessed in\nthe form of initial states of quantum circuits and where arbitrary projective\nmeasurements may be used to ascertain success or failure. This generalization\nallows us to derive interesting applications of amplitude amplification for\ndistinguishing between two given distributions based on their samples,\ndetection of faults in quantum circuits and eliminating error of one and\ntwo-sided quantum algorithms with exact errors.\n", "  The central nervous system and particularly the brain was designed to control\nthe life cycle of a living being. With increasing size and sophistication, in\nmammals, the brain became capable of exercising significant control over life.\nIn Homo Sapiens the brain became significantly powerful and capable of\ncomprehension beyond survival needs with visualisation, formal thought and long\nterm memory. Here we trace the rise of the powers of the brains of the Homo\nSapiens and its capability of three comprehending the three spatial dimensions\nas well as time. By tracing the evolution of technology over the last\nmillennium and particularly the late arrival of astronomy to discuss the\nevolution of the formal thinking process in humans. In a follow up paper we\nwill trace the extensive use of this new faculty by humans to comprehend the\nworking of the universe.\n", "  We attempt to provide a comprehensive model of evolution of science across\nmillennia taking into account the contributions of other intellectual\ntraditions, cultural value system and increasing in sophistication of humans in\ntheir study of nature. We also briefly discuss the role of technology and its\ninterplay in the evolution of science. We identify five primary approaches to\nthe study of nature, namely ad hoc formulations, religious approach, pragmatic\napproach, axiomatic approach and the logic based approach. Each of these\napproaches have had their prime periods and have contributed significantly to\nhuman understanding of nature and have also overlapped within a society. Each\napproach has had a central role over human evolution at some stage. We surmise\nthat the currently dominant axiomatic method will reach its limits due to\ncomplexity of the system and may never be fully formalised. We suggest that the\nfuture progress of science will more be a logic based approach where\nexperimentation and simulations rather than axiomatic firmness will be used to\ntest our understanding of nature.\n", "  We consider resonances for third order ordinary differential operator with\ncompactly supported coefficients on the real line. Resonance are defined as\nzeros of a Fredholm determinant on a non-physical sheet of three sheeted\nRiemann surface. We determine upper bounds of the number of resonances in\ncomplex discs at large radius. We express the trace formula in terms of\nresonances only.\n", "  Automated source extraction and parameterization represents a crucial\nchallenge for the next-generation radio interferometer surveys, such as those\nperformed with the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) and its precursors. In this\npaper we present a new algorithm, dubbed CAESAR (Compact And Extended Source\nAutomated Recognition), to detect and parametrize extended sources in radio\ninterferometric maps. It is based on a pre-filtering stage, allowing image\ndenoising, compact source suppression and enhancement of diffuse emission,\nfollowed by an adaptive superpixel clustering stage for final source\nsegmentation. A parameterization stage provides source flux information and a\nwide range of morphology estimators for post-processing analysis. We developed\nCAESAR in a modular software library, including also different methods for\nlocal background estimation and image filtering, along with alternative\nalgorithms for both compact and diffuse source extraction. The method was\napplied to real radio continuum data collected at the Australian Telescope\nCompact Array (ATCA) within the SCORPIO project, a pathfinder of the ASKAP-EMU\nsurvey. The source reconstruction capabilities were studied over different test\nfields in the presence of compact sources, imaging artefacts and diffuse\nemission from the Galactic plane and compared with existing algorithms. When\ncompared to a human-driven analysis, the designed algorithm was found capable\nof detecting known target sources and regions of diffuse emission,\noutperforming alternative approaches over the considered fields.\n", "  In this work, molecular mechanics simulations were performed using a modified\nembedded-atom method (MEAM) potential to generate the stress-strain responses\nof a series of n-alkane molecules from ethane (C$_2$H$_6$) to undecane\n(n-C$_{11}$H$_{24}$) in tensile deformation up to the point of bond rupture.\nThe results are further generalized to a single polyethylene (PE) chain. Force,\ntrue Cauchy stress, true virial stress, and Young's moduli were calculated as a\nfunction of true strain for all of the molecules. In calculating the stress of\na single molecule, three methods (designated in this work as M1, M2, and M3)\nare suggested based on three different metrics to quantify both the\ninstantaneous molecular cross-sectional area and volume during deformation. The\npredictions of these methods are compared to theoretical, first-principles, and\nexperimental data. M1 gives true Cauchy and true virial stress results that are\nessentially equivalent, suggesting that it is a better method for calculating\nstress in alkane molecules and, hence, PE single chain. The MEAM predictions of\nthe average elastic modulus for a single PE chain using M1, M2, and M3 are 401\nGPa, 172 GPa, and 147 GPa, respectively. Though these results are disparate, M1\ngives a modulus value that is strikingly close to the ab initio-calculated\nvalue of 405 GPa for the -CH$_2$CH$_2$- repeat unit of PE at 0 K. To further\ntest the MEAM potential, the Young's modulus (C$_{33}$ elastic constant) of an\northorhombic PE crystal cell was calculated, but its value (184 GPa)\nunderestimates the DFT-calculated value of 316 GPa by 42%.\n", "  The Hamiltonian of 2+1 dimensional Yang Mills theory was derived by Karabali,\nKim and Nair by using point splitting regularization. But in calculating e.g.\nthe vacuum wave functional this scheme was left in favour of arguments. Here we\nfollow up a conjecture of Leigh, Minic and Yelnikov of how this gap might be\nfilled by including all positive powers of the regularization parameter ($\\ep\n\\to +0$). Admittedly, though we concentrate on the ground state in the large\n$N$ limit, only two such powers could be included due to the increasing\ncomplexity of the task.\n", "  We describe our research programme on the use of atomic magnetometers to\ndetect conductive objects via electromagnetic induction. The extreme\nsensitivity of atomic magnetometers at low frequencies, up to seven orders of\nmagnitude higher than a coil-based system, permits deep penetration through\ndifferent media and barriers, and in various operative environments. This\neliminates the limitations usually associated with electromagnetic detection.\n", "  I present an interconversion currents algebra for an atom-molecule\nBose-Einstein condensate model and use it to get the quantum dynamics of the\ncurrents. For different choices of the Hamiltonian parameters I get different\ncurrents dynamics.\n", "  As in Deformed Special Relativity, we showed recently that the Fock\ncoordinate transformation can be derived from a new deformed Poisson brackets.\nThis approach allowed us to establish the corresponding momentum transformation\nwhich keeps invariant the four dimensional contraction $p_{\\mu} x^{\\mu} $. From\nthe resulting deformed algebra, we construct in this paper the corresponding\nfirst Casimir. After first quantization, we show by using the Klein-Gordon\nequation that the spacetime of the Fock transformation is the de Sitter one. As\nwe will see, the invariant length representing the universe radius in the\nspacetime of Fock's transformation is exactly the radius of the embedded\nhypersurface representing the de Sitter spacetime.\n", "  The charm quark mass is one of the fundamental parameters of the Standard\nModel Lagrangian. In this work we present a determination of the MSbar charm\nmass from a fit to the inclusive and charm HERA deep-inelastic structure\nfunction data. The analysis is performed within the xFitter framework, with\nstructure functions computed in the FONLL general-mass scheme as implemented in\nAPFEL. In the case of the FONLL-C scheme, we obtain mc(mc) = 1.335 +-\n0.043(exp) +0.019 -0.000(param) +0.011 -0.008(mod) +0.033 -0.008(th) GeV. We\nalso perform an analogous determination in the fixed-flavor-number scheme at\nnext-to-leading order, finding mc(mc) = 1.318 +- 0.054(exp) +0.011\n-0.010(param) +0.015 -0.019(mod) +0.045 -0.004(th) GeV, compatible with the\nFONLL-C value. Our results are consistent with previous determinations from DIS\ndata as well as with the PDG world average.\n", "  Formation of spatial patterns of cells is a recurring theme in biology and\noften depends on regulated cell motility. Motility of M. xanthus depends on two\nmotility machineries: the S-engine and A-engine. Moving M. xanthus cells can\norganize into spreading colonies or spore-filled fruiting bodies depending on\ntheir nutritional status. To understand these two pattern formation processes\nand the contributions by the two motility machineries, as well as cell\nreversal, we analyze spatial self-organization in 3 strains: i) a mutant that\nmoves unidirectionally without reversing by the A-motility system only, ii) a\nunidirectional mutant that is also equipped with the S-motility system, and\niii) the wild-type that, in addition to the two motility systems, reverses its\ndirection of movement. The mutant moving by the A-engine illustrates that\ncollective motion in the form of large moving clusters can arise in gliding\nbacteria due to steric interactions of the rod-shaped cells, without the need\nof invoking any biochemical signal regulation. The two-engine strain mutant\nreveals that the same phenomenon emerges when both motility systems are\npresent, and as long as cells exhibit unidirectional motion only. From the\nstudy of these two strains, we conclude that unidirectional cell motion induces\nthe formation of large moving clusters at low and intermediate densities, while\nit results into vortex formation at very high densities. These findings are\nconsistent with what is known from self-propelled rods which strongly suggests\nthat the combined effect of self-propulsion and volume exclusion interactions\nis the pattern formation mechanism leading to the observed phenomena. In\naddition, we learn that when cells reverse, as observed in the wild-type, cells\nform small but strongly elongated clusters and self-organize into a mesh-like\nstructure at high enough densities.\n", "  In this study, we investigated the terahertz radiation from a truncated edge\nsquare mesa structure made from a superconducting\nBi_{2}Sr_{2}CaCu_{2}O_{8+{\\delta}} . Using a commercial software, the\npolarization characteristics were determined, and introduced, while accounting\nfor the skin effect. The axial ratio was enhanced in the simulation by\nperforming a parametric study on the design.\n", "  An exactly solvable time-dependent quantum mechanical problem is employed to\nstudy the convergence properties of transition amplitudes calculated by using\nthe Schwinger variational principle. A detailed comparison between the\namplitudes approximated by the perturbative series and by their associated\nSchwinger variational principles is performed. The much better performance\nobtained by the variational principle is documented through different case\nstudies. For a given order of the Schwinger principle, it is observed that the\ntransition amplitudes do not converge to the exact one for large perturbations.\nThe latter is true even though large combinations of unperturbed states with\nconstant coefficients are taken as trial wave functions. As a matter of fact,\nit is shown that the improvement of the method comes from using better trial\nwave functions and increasing the order of the Schwinger principle employed.\n", "  The role of Network Theory in the study of the financial crisis has been\nwidely spotted in the latest years. It has been shown how the network topology\nand the dynamics running on top of it can trigger the outbreak of large\nsystemic crisis. Following this methodological perspective we introduce here\nthe Accounting Network, i.e. the network we can extract through vector\nsimilarities techniques from companies' financial statements. We build the\nAccounting Network on a large database of worldwide banks in the period\n2001-2013, covering the onset of the global financial crisis of mid-2007. After\na careful data cleaning, we apply a quality check in the construction of the\nnetwork, introducing a parameter (the Quality Ratio) capable of trading off the\nsize of the sample (coverage) and the representativeness of the financial\nstatements (accuracy). We compute several basic network statistics and check,\nwith the Louvain community detection algorithm, for emerging communities of\nbanks. Remarkably enough sensible regional aggregations show up with the\nJapanese and the US clusters dominating the community structure, although the\npresence of a geographically mixed community points to a gradual convergence of\nbanks into similar supranational practices. Finally, a Principal Component\nAnalysis procedure reveals the main economic components that influence\ncommunities' heterogeneity. Even using the most basic vector similarity\nhypotheses on the composition of the financial statements, the signature of the\nfinancial crisis clearly arises across the years around 2008. We finally\ndiscuss how the Accounting Networks can be improved to reflect the best\npractices in the financial statement analysis.\n", "  We explore the Mode I fracture toughness of a polymer gel containing a\nsemi-infinite, growing crack. First, an expression is derived for the energy\nrelease rate within the linearized, small-strain setting. This expression\nreveals a crack tip velocity-independent toughening that stems from the\nporoelastic nature of polymer gels. Then, we establish a poroelastic cohesive\nzone model that allows us to describe the micromechanics of fracture in gels by\nidentifying the role of solvent pressure in promoting poroelastic toughening.\nWe evaluate the enhancement in the effective fracture toughness through\nasymptotic analysis. We confirm our theoretical findings by means of numerical\nsimulations concerning the case of a steadily propagating crack. In broad\nterms, our results explain the role of poroelasticity and of the processes\noccurring in the fracturing region in promoting toughening of polymer gels.\n", "  This dissertation investigates the flavor mixing effects in supersymmetric\nmodels on electroweak precision observables, Higgs boson mass predictions,\nB-physics observables, quark flavor violating Higgs decays, lepton flavor\nviolating charged lepton decays and lepton flavor violating Higgs decays. The\nflavor mixing effects are studied in model independent way i.e. by putting\noff-diagonal entries in the sfermion mass matrix by hand as well as in the\nminimal flavor violating constrained MSSM, where mixing can originate from CKM\nmatrix in the case of squarks and from PMNS matrix in the case of sleptons. We\nfound that flavor mixing can have large impact to some observables, enabling us\nto put new constraints on parameter space in supersymmetric models.\n", "  A common approach to model memristive systems is to include empirical window\nfunctions to describe edge effects and non-linearities in the change of the\nmemristance. We demonstrate that under quite general conditions, each window\nfunction can be associated with a sigmoidal curve relating the normalised\ntime-dependent memristance to the time integral of the input. Conversely, this\nexplicit relation allows us to derive window functions suitable for the\nmesoscopic modelling of memristive systems from a variety of well-known\nsigmoidals. Such sigmoidal curves are defined in terms of measured variables\nand can thus be extracted from input and output signals of a device and then\ntransformed to its corresponding window. We also introduce a new generalised\nwindow function that allows the flexible modelling of asymmetric edge effects\nin a simple manner.\n", "  The recent advent of photonic topological insulators has opened the door to\nusing the robustness of topologically protected transport (originated in the\ndomain of condensed matter physics) in optical devices and in quantum\nsimulation. Concurrently, quantum walks in photonic networks have been shown to\nyield exponential speedup for certain algorithms, such as Boson sampling. Here\nwe theoretically demonstrate that photonic topological insulators can robustly\nprotect the transport of quantum information through photonic networks, despite\nthe presence of disorder.\n", "  The impact of a laser pulse on a highly absorbing liquid drop can lead to a\nviolent response: the drop is accelerated, strongly deforms, and eventually\nfragments. Shock waves, the ejection of matter, and even plasma formation can\naccompany this process ...\n", "  The transit of Mercury occurred two times in this century: 2003, May 7 and\n2006, November 8. In 2016 there is another opportunity to observe this\nphenomenon and measure the solar diameter with the method of comparing the\nephemerides with the observations. This method has been presented by I. I.\nShapiro in 1980, the data of the observed transits (since 1631) have been\nre-analyzed by Sveshnikov (2002) and an improvement on the observed data, to\navoid the confusion given by the black-drop effect, proposed by C. Sigismondi\nand collaborators since 2005 exploits the measurement of the chord drawn by the\nsolar limb with the disk of the transiting planet and its extrapolation to zero\nthrough the analytic chord fitting the observations before the black drop, in\nthe ingress/egress phases. A network of European observers (IOTA/ES) and\nobservatories (coronograph of Bialkow, PL 56 cm; IRSOL, Locarno CH - 45 cm\nGregorian telescope) is active for the 2016 transit. Recommendations to improve\nthe observation of the ingress/egress phases and examples of the data analysis\non the 1999 Mercury transit observed by TRACE are also done: the planet should\nbe centered in the field of view of the telescope to avoid optical distortions,\nand the observations should be prolonged well after the black drop phase,\nestimated in about 40 seconds and more after the internal contact t2 in the\ningress and before the internal contact t3 in egress.\n", "  X-ray-induced photoemission in materials research is commonly acknowledged as\na method with a probing depth limited by the escape depth of the\nphotoelectrons. This general statement should be complemented with exceptions\narising from the distribution of the X-ray wavefield in the material. Here we\nshow that the integral hard-X-ray-induced photoemission yield is modulated by\nthe Fresnel reflectivity of a multilayer structure with the signal originating\nwell below the photoelectron escape depth. A simple electric self-detection of\nthe integral photoemission yield and Fourier data analysis permit extraction of\nthicknesses of individual layers. The approach does not require detection of\nthe reflected radiation and can be considered as a framework for non-invasive\nevaluation of buried layers with hard X-rays under grazing incidence.\n", "  In a previous work, we introduced a tool for analyzing multiple datasets\nsimultaneously, which has been implemented into ISIS. This tool was used to fit\nmany spectra of X-ray binaries. However, the large number of degrees of freedom\nand individual datasets raise an issue about a good measure for a simultaneous\nfit quality. We present three ways to check the goodness of these fits: we\ninvestigate the goodness of each fit in all datasets, we define a combined\ngoodness exploiting the logical structure of a simultaneous fit, and we stack\nthe fit residuals of all datasets to detect weak features. These tools are\napplied to all RXTE-spectra from GRO 1008-57, revealing calibration features\nthat are not detected significantly in any single spectrum. Stacking the\nresiduals from the best-fit model for the Vela X-1 and XTE J1859+083 data\nevidences fluorescent emission lines that would have gone undetected otherwise.\n", "  Parallel computing and steadily increasing computation speed have led to a\nnew tool for analyzing multiple datasets and datatypes: fitting several\ndatasets simultaneously. With this technique, physically connected parameters\nof individual data can be treated as a single parameter by implementing this\nconnection into the fit directly. We discuss the terminology, implementation,\nand possible issues of simultaneous fits based on the X-ray data analysis tool\nInteractive Spectral Interpretation System (ISIS). While all data modeling\ntools in X-ray astronomy allow in principle fitting data from multiple data\nsets individually, the syntax used in these tools is not often well suited for\nthis task. Applying simultaneous fits to the transient X-ray binary GRO\nJ1008-57, we find that the spectral shape is only dependent on X-ray flux. We\ndetermine time independent parameters such as, e.g., the folding energy E_fold,\nwith unprecedented precision.\n", "  The THz spectrum of density fluctuations, $S(Q, \\omega)$, of vitreous GeO$_2$\nat ambient temperature was measured by inelastic x-ray scattering from ambient\npressure up to pressures well beyond that of the known $\\alpha$-quartz to\nrutile polyamorphic (PA) transition. We observe significant differences in the\nspectral shape measured below and above the PA transition, in particular, in\nthe 30-80 meV range. Guided by first-principle lattice dynamics calculations,\nwe interpret the changes in the phonon dispersion as the evolution from a\nquartz-like to a rutile-like coordination. Notably, such a crossover is\naccompanied by a cusp-like behavior in the pressure dependence of the elastic\nresponse of the system. Overall, the presented results highlight the complex\nfingerprint of PA phenomena on the high-frequency phonon dispersion.\n", "  We perform a comprehensive stacking analysis of data collected by the Fermi\nLarge Area Telescope (LAT) of gamma-ray bursts (GRB) localized by the Swift\nspacecraft, which were not detected by the LAT but which fell within the\ninstrument's field of view at the time of trigger. We examine a total of 79\nGRBs by comparing the observed counts over a range of time intervals to that\nexpected from designated background orbits, as well as by using a joint\nlikelihood technique to model the expected distribution of stacked counts. We\nfind strong evidence for subthreshold emission at MeV to GeV energies using\nboth techniques. This observed excess is detected during intervals that include\nand exceed the durations typically characterizing the prompt emission observed\nat keV energies and lasts at least 2700 s after the co-aligned burst trigger.\nBy utilizing a novel cumulative likelihood analysis, we find that although a\nburst's prompt gamma-ray and afterglow X-ray flux both correlate with the\nstrength of the subthreshold emission, the X-ray afterglow flux measured by\nSwift's X-ray Telescope (XRT) at 11 hr post trigger correlates far more\nsignificantly. Overall, the extended nature of the subthreshold emission and\nits connection to the burst's afterglow brightness lend further support to the\nexternal forward shock origin of the late-time emission detected by the LAT.\nThese results suggest that the extended high-energy emission observed by the\nLAT may be a relatively common feature but remains undetected in a majority of\nbursts owing to instrumental threshold effects.\n", "  We consider the problem of quantum-state tomography under the assumption that\nthe state is pure, and more generally that its rank is bounded by a given value\n$r$. In this scenario two notions of informationally complete measurements\nemerge: rank-$r$ complete measurements and rank-$r$ strictly-complete\nmeasurements. Whereas in the first notion, a rank-$r$ state is uniquely\nidentified from within the set of rank-$r$ states, in the second notion the\nsame state is uniquely identified from within the set of all physical states,\nof any rank. We argue, therefore, that strictly-complete measurements are\ncompatible with convex optimization, and we prove that they allow robust\nquantum state estimation in the presence of experimental noise. We also show\nthat rank-$r$ strictly-complete measurements are as efficient as rank-$r$\ncomplete measurements. We construct examples of strictly-complete measurements\nand give a complete description of their structure in the context of matrix\ncompletion. Moreover, we numerically show that a few random bases form such\nmeasurements. We demonstrate the efficiency-robustness property for different\nstrictly-complete measurements with numerical experiments. We thus conclude\nthat only strictly-complete measurements are useful for practical tomography.\n", "  A unitary model describing the electronic transitions in an atom subject to a\nstrong high frequency laser pulse is proposed. The model fully accounts for the\ninitial state coupling with the continuum spectrum. Continuum-continuum as well\nas discrete-discrete transitions are neglected. The model leads to a single\nintegro-differential equation for the initial state amplitude. Exact numerical\nand approximate closed semi-analytical solutions of this equation are obtained.\nA comparison of present results with full time dependent Schr\\\"odinger equation\nsolution for Hydrogen atoms subject to a laser pulse is presented. The initial\nstate time dependent population is rather well described by the model and two\napproximate solutions. The electron energy spectrum is also well reproduced by\nthe model and by a new improved Weiskopf-Wigner related approximation.\n", "  Nano artifact metrics exploit unique physical attributes of nanostructured\nmatter for authentication and clone resistance, which is vitally important in\nthe age of Internet-of-Things where securing identities is critical. However,\nhigh-cost and huge experimental apparatuses, such as scanning electron\nmicroscopy, have been required in the former studies. Herein, we demonstrate an\noptical approach to characterise the nanoscale-precision signatures of silicon\nrandom structures towards realising low-cost and high-value information\nsecurity technology. Unique and versatile silicon nanostructures are generated\nvia resist collapse phenomena, which contains dimensions that are well below\nthe diffraction limit of light. We exploit the nanoscale precision ability of\nconfocal laser microscopy in the height dimension, and our experimental results\ndemonstrate that the vertical precision of measurement is essential in\nsatisfying the performances required for artifact metrics. Furthermore, by\nusing state-of-the-art nanostructuring technology, we experimentally fabricate\nclones from the genuine devices. We demonstrate that the statistical properties\nof the genuine and clone devices are successfully exploited, showing that the\nliveness-detection-type approach, which is widely deployed in biometrics, is\nvalid in artificially-constructed solid-state nanostructures. These findings\npave the way for reasonable and yet sufficiently secure novel principles for\ninformation security based on silicon random nanostructures and optical\ntechnologies.\n", "  The steady, asymmetric and two-dimensional flow of viscous, incompressible\nmicropolar fluid through a rectangular channel with a splitter (parallel to\nwalls) was formulated and simulated numerically. The plane Poiseuille flow was\nconsidered far from upstream and downstream of the splitter. The geometric\nparameter that controls the position of splitter was defined as splitter\nposition parameter. A numerical scheme that comprises a fourth order method\nfollowed by special finite-difference method was used to solve the boundary\nvalue problem. This numerical scheme transforms the governing equations to\nsystem of finite difference equations which we have solved by SOR iterative\nmethod. Moreover, the results obtained were further refined and upgraded by the\nRichardson extrapolation method. The results were compared on different grid\nsizes as well as with the existing results for symmetric flow of Newtonian\nfluids. The comparisons were satisfactory. The microrotation effects on the\nsplitter plate were significantly high as compared to other locations of the\nchannel. This highest value for the asymmetric channel was higher in magnitude\nas compared to for the symmetric one. Furthermore, the proclivity of rotation\nof aciculate elements of the fluid about their centroids rises if either the\nReynolds' number increases or/and the distance between the upper and splitter\nplates decreases.\n", "  The Latin American Giant Observatory (LAGO) is an extended cosmic ray\nobservatory composed by a network of water-Cherenkov detectors spanning over\ndifferent sites located at significantly different altitudes (from sea level up\nto more than $5000$\\,m a.s.l.) and latitudes across Latin America, covering a\nhuge range of geomagnetic rigidity cut-offs and atmospheric absorption/reaction\nlevels. This detection network is designed to measure the temporal evolution of\nthe radiation flux at ground level with extreme detail. The LAGO project is\nmainly oriented to perform basic research in three branches: high energy\nphenomena, space weather and atmospheric radiation at ground level. LAGO is\nbuilt and operated by the LAGO Collaboration, a non-centralized collaborative\nunion of more than 30 institutions from ten countries.\n  These are the contributions of the LAGO Collaboration to the 34th\nInternational Cosmic Ray Conference, 30 July - 6 August 2015, The Hague, The\nNetherlands\n", "  Three-dimensional cutoff regulators are frequently employed in multi-nucleon\ncalculations, but they violate chiral symmetry and Lorentz invariance. A cutoff\nregularization scheme is proposed to compensate systematically at subleading\norders for these symmetry violations caused by regulator artifacts. This is\nespecially helpful when a soft momentum cutoff has to be used for technical\nreasons. It is also shown that dimensional regularization can still be used for\nsome Feynman (sub)diagrams while cutoff regulators are used for the rest.\n", "  Time-evolution of open, dissipative quantum system is a stochastic process\nthat consists of a series of quantum jumps that take place at random times.\nBetween quantum jumps quantum system idles for some time in a particular\nquantum state. Based on superfermion/superboson formalism and general\nKossakowski- Lindblad master equation for an open quantum system we develop a\nmethod to compute distribution of waiting times between quantum jumps. We\nillustrate the use of the theory by computing waiting time distribution for\nmodel Fermi-system in thermodynamic equilibrium.\n", "  Temporal information is increasingly available as part of large network data\nsets. This information reveals sequences of link activations between network\nentities, which can expose underlying processes in the data. Examples include\nthe dissemination of information through a social network, the propagation of\nmusical ideas in a music sampling network, and the spread of a disease via\ncontacts between infected and susceptible individuals. The search for these\nmore meaningful patterns may be formulated as a time-respecting subgraph\nisomorphism problem. Our set of query graphs include an enumeration of small\nrandom graphs and fan-out-fan-in structures, all composed of time-respecting\npaths. We explore three methods of solving the problem, which differ in how\nthey exploit temporal and topological information. One approach extracts all\nsubgraphs that have the temporal properties we require and then performs\nsubgraph isomorphism testing on each subgraph. Another approach performs\nsubgraph isomorphism testing first with temporal post-filtering, while the\nother is a hybrid approach that uses temporal information during the search. We\nempirically demonstrate the hybrid approach to be more efficient than the\nothers, over a range of network data sets. These data come from communication\nand social networks, up to interactions in size.\n", "  The time variation of the equation of state $w$ for quintessence scenario\nwith a scalar field as dark energy is studied up to the third derivative\n($d^3w/da^3$) with respect to the scale factor $a$, in order to predict the\nfuture observations and specify the scalar potential parameters with the\nobservables. The third derivative of $w$ for general potential $V$ is derived\nand applied to several types of potentials. They are the inverse power-law\n($V=M^{4+\\alpha}/Q^{\\alpha}$), the exponential ($V=M^4\\exp{(\\beta M/Q)}$), the\ncosine ($V=M^4(\\cos (Q/f)+1)$) and the Gaussian types\n($V=M^4\\exp(-Q^2/\\sigma^2)$), which are prototypical potentials for the\nfreezing and thawing models.\n  If the parameter number for a potential form is $ n$, it is necessary to find\nat least for $n+2$ independent observations to identify the potential form and\nthe evolution of the scalar field ($Q$ and $ \\dot{Q} $).\n  Such observations would be the values of $ \\Omega_Q, w, dw/da. \\cdots $, and\n$ dw^n/da^n$.\n  Since four of the above mentioned potentials have two parameters, it is\nnecessary to calculate the third derivative of $w$ for them to estimate the\npredict values.\n  If they are tested observationally, it will be understood whether the dark\nenergy could be described by the scalar field with this potential.\n  Numerical analysis for $d^3w/da^3$ are made under some specified parameters\nin the investigated potentials.\n  It becomes possible to distinguish the freezing and thawing modes by the\naccurate observing $dw/da$ and $d^2w/da^2$ in some parameters.\n", "  The counterfactuality of recently proposed protocols is analyzed. A\ndefinition of `counterfactuality' is offered and it is argued that an\ninteraction-free measurement of the presence of an opaque object can be named\n`counterfactual', while proposed \"counterfactual\" measurements of the absence\nof such objects are not counterfactual. The quantum key distribution protocols\nwhich rely only on measurements of the presence of the object are\ncounterfactual, but quantum direct communication protocols are not. Therefore,\nthe name `counterfactual' is not appropriate for recent \"counterfactual\"\nprotocols which transfer quantum states by quantum direct communication.\n", "  In 1933, Meissner and Ochsenfeld reported the expulsion of magnetic flux, the\ndiamagnetic Meissner effect, from the interior of superconducting lead. This\ndiscovery was crucial in formulating the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory\nof superconductivity. In exotic superconducting systems BCS theory does not\nstrictly apply. A classical example is a superconductor-magnet hybrid system\nwhere magnetic ordering breaks time-reversal symmetry of the superconducting\ncondensate and results in the stabilisation of an odd-frequency superconducting\nstate. It has been predicted that under appropriate conditions, odd-frequency\nsuperconductivity should manifest in the Meissner state as fluctuations in the\nsign of the magnetic susceptibility meaning that the superconductivity can\neither repel (diamagnetic) or attract (paramagnetic) external magnetic flux.\nHere we report local probe measurements of faint magnetic fields in a Au/Ho/Nb\ntrilayer system using low energy muons, where antiferromagnetic Ho (4.5 nm)\nbreaks time-reversal symmetry of the proximity induced pair correlations in Au.\nFrom depth-resolved measurements below the superconducting transition of Nb we\nobserve a local enhancement of the magnetic field in Au that exceeds the\nexternally applied field, thus proving the existence of an intrinsic\nparamagnetic Meissner effect arising from an odd-frequency superconducting\nstate.\n", "  Electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) is a promising technology for\nthe enhancement of light-matter interactions, and recent demonstrations of the\nquantum EIT realized in artificial micro-structured medium have remarkably\nreduced the extreme requirement for experimental observation of EIT spectrum.\nIn this paper, we propose to electrically control the EIT spectrum in a\nmetamaterial for an electromagnetic modulator. A diode acting as a tunable\nresistor is loaded in the gap of two paired wires to inductively tune the\nmagnetic resonance, which induces remarkable modulation on the EIT spectrum\nthrough the metamaterial sample. The experimental measurements confirmed that\nthe prediction of electromagnetic modulation in three narrow bands on the EIT\nspectrum, and a modulation contrast of up to 31 dB was achieved on the\ntransmission through the metamaterial. Our results may facilitate the study on\nactive/dynamical technology in translational metamaterials, which connect\nextraordinary manipulations on the flow of light in metamaterials, e.g., the\nexotic EIT, and practical applications in industry.\n", "  We study the reduction in total entropy, and associated conversion of\nenvironmental heat into work, arising from the coupling and decoupling of two\nsystems followed by processing determined by suitable mutual feedback. The\nscheme is based on the actions of Maxwell's demon, namely the performance of a\nmeasurement on a system followed by an exploitation of the outcome to extract\nwork. When this is carried out in a symmetric fashion, with each system\ninforming the exploitation of the other (and both therefore acting as a demon),\nit may be shown that the second law can be broken, a consequence of the\nself-sorting character of the system dynamics.\n", "  The neutrino burst from a core-collapse supernova can provide information\nabout the star explosion mechanism and the mechanisms of proto neutron star\ncooling but also about the intrinsic properties of the neutrino such as flavor\noscillations. One important question is to understand to which extent can the\nsupernova and the neutrino physics be decoupled in the observation of a single\nsupernova. The capabilities of present and future large underground neutrino\ndetectors to yield information about the time and flavor dependent neutrino\nsignal from a future galactic supernova are described in this paper. Neutrinos\nfrom past cosmic supernovae are also observable and their detection will\nimprove our knowledge of the core-collapse rates and average neutrino emission.\nA comparison between the different experimental techniques is included.\n", "  Low-frequency radio phenomena are due to the presence of nonthermal electrons\nin the interplanetary (IP) medium. Understanding these phenomena is important\nin characterizing the space environment near Earth and other destinations in\nthe solar system. Substantial progress has been made in the past two decades,\nbecause of the continuous and uniform data sets available from space-based\nradio and white-light instrumentation. This paper highlights some recent\nresults obtained on IP radio phenomena. In particular, the source of type IV\nradio bursts, the behavior of type III storms, shock propagation in the IP\nmedium, and the solar-cycle variation of type II radio bursts are considered.\nAll these phenomena are closely related to solar eruptions and active region\nevolution. The results presented were obtained by combining data from the Wind\nand SOHO missions.\n", "  We report on the status of solar cycle 24 based on polar prominence eruptions\n(PEs) and microwave brightness enhancement (MBE) information obtained by the\nNobeyama radioheliograph. The north polar region of the Sun had near-zero field\nstrength for more than three years (2012 to 2015) and ended only in September\n2015 as indicated by the presence of polar PEs and the lack of MBE. The\nzero-polar-field condition in the south started only around 2013, but it ended\nby June 2014. Thus the asymmetry in the times of polarity reversal switched\nbetween cycle 23 and 24. The polar MBE is a good proxy for the polar magnetic\nfield strength as indicated by the high degree of correlation between the two.\nThe cross-correlation between the high- and low-latitude MBEs is significant\nfor a lag of ~5.5 to 7.3 years, suggesting that the polar field of one cycle\nindicates the sunspot number of the next cycle in agreement with the\nBabcock-Leighton mechanism of solar cycles. The extended period of near-zero\nfield in the north-polar region should result in a weak and delayed sunspot\nactivity in the northern hemisphere in cycle 25.\n", "  An intense type IV radio burst was observed by the STEREO Behind (STB)\nspacecraft located about 144 degres behind Earth. The burst was associated with\na large solar eruption that occurred on the backside of the Sun (N05E151) close\nto the disk center in the STB view. The eruption was also observed by the\nSTEREO Ahead (STA) spacecraft (located at 149 degrees ahead of Earth) as an\neruption close to the west limb (N05W60) in that view. The type IV burst was\ncomplete in STB observations in that the envelope reached the lowest frequency\nand then receded to higher frequencies. The burst was partial viewed from STA,\nrevealing only the edge coming down to the lowest frequency. The type IV burst\nwas not observed at all near Earth because the source was 61 degrees behind the\neast limb. The eruption was associated with a low-frequency type II burst\nobserved in all three views, although it was not very intense. Solar energetic\nparticles were also observed at both STEREOs and at SOHO, suggesting that the\nshock was much extended, consistent with the very high speed of the CME (about\n2048 km/s). These observations suggest that the type IV emission is directed\nalong a narrow cone above the flare site. We confirm this result statistically\nusing the type IV bursts of solar cycle 23.\n", "  Museums often suffer from so-called \"hyper-congestion\", wherein the number of\nvisitors exceeds the capacity of the physical space of the museum. This can\npotentially deteriorate the quality of visitor's experience disturbed by other\nvisitors' behaviors and presences. Although this situation can be mitigated by\nmanaging visitors' flow between spaces, a detailed analysis of the visitor's\nmovement is required to fully realize and apply a proper solution to the\nproblem. This paper analyzes the visitor's sequential movements, the spatial\nlayout, and the relationship between them in large-scale art museums - Louvre\nMuseum - using anonymized data collected through noninvasive Bluetooth sensors.\nThis enables us to unveil some features of visitor's behavior and spatial\nimpact that shed some light on the mechanism of the museum overcrowding. The\nanalysis reveals that the visiting style of short and long stay visitors are\nnot as significantly different as one could expect. Both types of visitors tend\nto visit a similar number of key locations in the museum while the longer stay\ntype visitors just tend to do so more extensively. In addition, we reveal that\nsome ways of exploring the museum appear frequently for both types of visitors,\nalthough long stay type visitors might be expected to diversify much more given\nthe greater time spent in the museum. We suggest that these\nsimilarities/dissimilarities make for an uneven distribution of the quantity of\nvisitors in the museum space. The findings increase the understanding of the\nunknown behaviors of visitors, which is key to improve the museum's environment\nand visiting experience.\n", "  The interaction of two orthogonally polarized beams and a four-level GaAs\nquantum well (QW) waveguide is investigated. It is shown that, by applying a\nstatic magnetic field normal to the propagation direction of the driving beams,\nthe birefringence can be induced in the QW waveguide. Moreover, it is\ndemonstrated that the dephasing rate between two ground states of the QW\nwaveguide makes it a dichromatic medium and can also diminish the induced\nbirefringence. Our results show how a large and complete magneto-optical\nrotation in the QW waveguide can be obtained via adjusting the intensity of the\nmagnetic field and also the length of the QW waveguide.\n", "  The interaction of two quantized fields and three-level quantum system in a\nlambda-type configuration is investigated in the presence of cross-Kerr\nnonlinearity. We consider three models of coupling for the atom-photon\ninteraction. First, we study the dynamical behavior of the atom-photon\nentanglement and show that increasing the cross-Kerr nonlinearity results in\ndifferent behaviors in three considered models. Moreover, it is demonstrated\nthat the two quantized modes can be entangled, on the other hand, by applying a\nclassical driving field to the lower levels. Increasing the classical driving\nfield destroys the long time atom-photon entanglement. Our results show that an\noscillatory two-mode squeezing can be generated in the absence of a driving\nclassical field and the cross-Kerr nonlinearity.\n", "  Sub-wavelength resolution imaging requires high numerical aperture (NA)\nlenses, which are bulky and expensive. Metasurfaces allow the miniaturization\nof conventional refractive optics into planar structures. We show that\nhigh-aspect-ratio titanium dioxide metasurfaces can be fabricated and designed\nas meta-lenses with NA = 0.8. Diffraction-limited focusing is demonstrated at\nwavelengths of 405 nm, 532 nm, and 660 nm with corresponding efficiencies of\n86%, 73%, and 66%. The meta-lenses can resolve nanoscale features separated by\nsub-wavelength distances and provide magnification as high as 170x with image\nqualities comparable to a state-of-the-art commercial objective. Our results\nfirmly establish that meta-lenses can have widespread applications in\nlaser-based microscopy, imaging, and spectroscopy.\n", "  Strong coupling of molecular vibrations to an infrared cavity mode affects\ntheir nature by creating dressed polariton states. We show how the single and\ndouble vibrational polariton manifolds may be controlled by varying the cavity\ncoupling strength, and probed by a time domain 2DIR technique, Double Quantum\nCoherence (DQC). Applications are made to the amide-I ($CO$) and amide-II\n($CN$) bond vibrations of $N-methylacetamide$ (NMA).\n", "  This paper introduces a new method of inferring the intrinsic exoplanet\npopulation from Kepler data, based on the assumption that the frequency of\nexoplanets can be represented by a smooth function of planet radius and period.\nThe method is applied to the two most recent data releases from the Kepler\nproject, q1-16 and q1-17, over the range of periods 0.5 to 512 days, and radii\n0.5 to 16 Earth radii. Both of these releases have known biases, with the first\nbelieved to contain excess false positives, and the second excess false\nnegatives, so any analysis of them should be viewed with caution. We apply the\nnew method of population estimation to these releases, treating them like\npractice data sets. With this method, we tentatively find that the average\nnumber of planets per star would be about $5.7\\pm0.8$ for F stars, $5.0\\pm0.2$\nfor G stars, $4.0\\pm0.3$ for K stars, and $6.5\\pm1.7$ for M stars, indicating a\ndecreasing trend with FGK spectral type, but an upward jump for M stars. A\nsecond conclusion is that the number of planets per G star, per natural log\nunit of period (days) and radii (Earths) at the period and radius of the Earth\naround the Sun, is about $\\Gamma_\\oplus(G) = 1.1\\pm 0.1$. A related parameter,\n$\\eta_{\\oplus}$, which in addition depends on the range of period and radius\nconsidered, is found to be $\\eta_{\\oplus}(G) \\simeq 1.0 \\pm 0.1 $. More\ndefinitive conclusions, and validation of these preliminary values, await the\nfinal release of Kepler's transiting exoplanet list.\n", "  We investigate numerically the decay of isotropic, rotating,\nmagnetohydrodynamic (MHD), and rotating MHD flows in a periodic box. The\nReynolds number $Re$ defined with the box size and the initial velocity is\n$100$ at which the flows are in a weakly nonlinear regime, i.e. not laminar but\nfar away from the fully turbulent state. The decay of isotropic flow has two\nstages, the first stage for the development of small scales and the second\nstage for the viscous dissipation. In the rapidly rotating flow, fast rotation\ninduces the inertial wave and causes the large-scale structure to inhibit the\ndevelopment of the first stage and retard the flow decay. In the MHD flow, the\nimposed field also causes the large-scale structure but facilitates the flow\ndecay in the first stage because of the energy conversion from flow to magnetic\nfield. Magnetic Reynolds number $Rm$ is important for the dynamics of the MHD\nflow, namely a high $Rm$ induces the Alfv\\'en wave but a low $Rm$ cannot. In\nthe rotating MHD flow, slower rotation tends to convert more kinetic energy to\nmagnetic energy. The orientation between the rotational and magnetic axes is\nimportant for the dynamics of the rotating MHD flow, namely the energy\nconversion is more efficient and the stronger wave is induced when the two axes\nare not parallel than when they are parallel.\n", "  Prevalence of electronic gadgets has been on the rise and among several\nconsiderations that are important for furthering frontiers of utility of new\ngadgets is mechanical flexibility of electronic systems. Flexible electronics\nrequire functional materials to be held by flexible substrates that can be bent\nto small radii of curvature. In addition, the functionality of the active\nmaterial has to remain intact during the process of bending. There have been\nchallenges in the transfer process of functional materials onto flexible\nsubstrates as well as challenges in maintaining the functionality of these\nmaterials during the bending process. Here we demonstrate transfer of carbon\nnanotubes, a highly studied electronic material, onto flexible substrates,\nmainly kapton. We study the optimum conditions of adhesion, pressure and\ntemperature required to obtain the strongest transferred layer. We further\nstudy the limits on the radius of curvature that the substrate can be bent to.\n", "  When identical oscillators are coupled together in a network, dynamical\nsteady states are often assumed to reflect network symmetries. Here we show\nthat alternative persistent states may also exist that break the symmetries of\nthe underlying coupling network. We further show that these symmetry-broken\ncoexistent states are analogous to those dubbed \"chimera states,\" which can\noccur when identical oscillators are coupled to one another in identical ways.\n", "  The understanding of tribo- and electro-chemical phenomenons on the molecular\nlevel at a sliding interface is a field of growing interest. Fundamental\nchemical and physical insights of sliding surfaces are crucial for\nunderstanding wear at an interface, particularly for nano or micro scale\ndevices operating at high sliding speeds. A complete investigation of the\nelectrochemical effects on high sliding speed interfaces requires a precise\nmonitoring of both the associated wear and surface chemical reactions at the\ninterface. Here, we demonstrate that head-disk interface inside a commercial\nmagnetic storage hard disk drive provides a unique system for such studies. The\nresults obtained shows that the voltage assisted electrochemical wear lead to\nasymmetric wear on either side of sliding interface.\n", "  Financial markets have been extensively studied as highly complex evolving\nsystems. In this paper, we quantify financial price fluctuations through a\ncoupled dynamical system composed of phase oscillators. We find a Financial\nCoherence and Incoherence (FCI) coexistence collective behavior emerges as the\nsystem evolves into the stable state, in which the stocks split into two\ngroups: one is represented by coherent, phase-locked oscillators, the other is\ncomposed of incoherent, drifting oscillators. It is demonstrated that the size\nof the coherent stock groups fluctuates during the economic periods according\nto real-world financial instabilities or shocks. Further, we introduce the\ncoherent characteristic matrix to characterize the involvement dynamics of\nstocks in the coherent groups. Clustering results on the matrix provides a\nnovel manifestation of the correlations among stocks in the economic periods.\nOur analysis for components of the groups is consistent with the Global\nIndustry Classification Standard (GICS) classification and can also figure out\nfeatures for newly developed industries. These results can provide potentially\nimplications on characterizing inner dynamical structure of financial markets\nand making optimal investment tragedies.\n", "  Detecting community structures in social networks has gained considerable\nattention in recent years. However, lack of prior knowledge about the number of\ncommunities, and their overlapping nature have made community detection a\nchallenging problem. Moreover, many of the existing methods only consider\nstatic networks, while most of real world networks are dynamic and evolve over\ntime. Hence, finding consistent overlapping communities in dynamic networks\nwithout any prior knowledge about the number of communities is still an\ninteresting open research problem. In this paper, we present an overlapping\ncommunity detection method for dynamic networks called Dynamic Bayesian\nOverlapping Community Detector (DBOCD). DBOCD assumes that in every snapshot of\nnetwork, overlapping parts of communities are dense areas and utilizes link\ncommunities instead of common node communities. Using Recurrent Chinese\nRestaurant Process and community structure of the network in the last snapshot,\nDBOCD simultaneously extracts the number of communities and soft community\nmemberships of nodes while maintaining the consistency of communities over\ntime. We evaluated DBOCD on both synthetic and real dynamic data-sets to assess\nits ability to find overlapping communities in different types of network\nevolution. The results show that DBOCD outperforms the recent state of the art\ndynamic community detection methods.\n", "  The spectra (rotational, rotation-vibrational or electronic) of diatomic\nmolecules due to transitions involving only closed-shell ($^1\\Sigma$)\nelectronic states follow very regular, simple patterns and their theoretical\nanalysis is usually straightforward. On the other hand, open-shell electronic\nstates lead to more complicated spectral patterns and, moreover, often appear\nas a manifold of closely lying electronic states, leading to perturbations with\neven larger complexity. This is especially true when at least one of the atoms\nis a transition metal. Traditionally these complex cases have been analysed\nusing approaches based on perturbation theory, with semi-empirical parameters\ndetermined by fitting to spectral data.\n  Recently the needs of two rather diverse scientific areas have driven the\ndemand for improved theoretical models of open-shell diatomic systems based on\nan \\emph{ab initio} approach, these areas are ultracold chemistry and the\nastrophysics of \"cool\" stars, brown dwarfs and most recently extrasolar\nplanets. However, the complex electronic structure of these molecules combined\nwith the accuracy requirements of high-resolution spectroscopy render such an\napproach particularly challenging. This review describes recent progress in\ndeveloping methods for directly solving the effective Schr\\\"odinger equation\nfor open-shell diatomic molecules, with a focus on molecules containing a\ntranstion metal. It considers four aspects of the problem: 1. The electronic\nstructure problem, 2. Non-perturbative treatments of the curve couplings, 3.\nThe solution of the nuclear motion Schr\\\"odinger equation, 4. The generation of\naccurate electric dipole transition intensities. Examples of applications are\nused to illustrate these issues.\n", "  Multimode entanglement is quintessential for the design and fabrication of\nquantum networks, which play a central role in quantum information processing\nand quantum metrology. However, an experimental setup is generally constructed\nwith a specific network configuration in mind and therefore exhibits reduced\nversatility and scalability. The present work demonstrates an on-demand,\nreconfigurable quantum network simulator, using an intrinsically multimode\nquantum resource and a homodyne detection apparatus. Without altering either\nthe initial squeezing source or experimen- tal architecture, we realize the\nconstruction of thirteen cluster states of various size and connectivity as\nwell as the implementation of a secret sharing protocol. In particular, this\nsimulator enables the interrogation of quantum correlations and fluctuations\nfor a Gaussian quantum network. This initi- ates a new avenue for implementing\non-demand quantum information processing by only adapting the measurement\nprocess and not the experimental layout.\n", "  Both local geometry and collective, extended excitations drive the moves of a\nparticle in the cage of its neighbours in dense liquids. The strength of their\ninfluence is investigated by Molecular Dynamics simulations of a supercooled\nliquid of fully-flexible trimers with semirigid or rigid bonds. The rattling in\nthe cage is investigated on different length scales. First, the rattling\nanisotropy due to local order is characterized by two order parameters sensing\nthe monomers succeeding or failing to escape from the cage. Then, the\ncollective response of the surroundings excited by the monomer-monomer\ncollisions is considered. The collective response is initially restricted to\nthe nearest neighbours of the colliding particle by a Voronoi analysis\nrevealing elastic contributions. Then, the long-range excitation of the\nfarthest neighbours is scrutinised by searching spatially-extended correlations\nbetween the simultaneous fast displacements of the caged particle and the\nsurroundings. It is found that the longitudinal component has stronger spatial\nmodulation than the transverse one with wavelength of about one particle\ndiameter, in close resemblance with experimental findings on colloids. It is\nconcluded that the cage rattling is largely affected by solid-like extended\nmodes.\n", "  Accretion of matter onto black holes is universally associated with strong\nradiative feedback and powerful outflows. In particular, black hole transients\nshow outflows whose properties are strongly coupled to those of the accretion\nflow. This includes X-ray winds of ionized material, expelled from the\naccretion disc encircling the black hole, and collimated radio jets. Very\nrecently, a distinct optical variability pattern has been reported in the\ntransient black hole transient V404 Cyg, and interpreted as disrupted mass flow\ninto the inner regions of its large accretion disc. Here, we report on the\ndiscovery of a sustained outer accretion disc wind in V404 Cyg, which is unlike\nany seen previously. We find that the outflowing wind is neutral, has a large\ncovering factor, expands at 1% of the speed of light and triggers a nebular\nphase once accretion sharply drops and the ejecta become optically thin. The\nlarge expelled mass (> 10^-8 Msun) indicates that the outburst was prematurely\nended when a sizeable fraction of the outer disc was depleted by the wind,\ndetaching the inner regions from the rest of the disc. The luminous, but brief,\naccretion phases shown by transients with large accretion discs imply that this\noutflow is most likely a new fundamental ingredient regulating mass accretion\nonto black holes.\n", "  Heavy fermion systems contain not only strong electron correlations, which\npromote a rich set of quantum phases, but also a large spin-orbit coupling,\nwhich tends to endow the electronic states a topological character. Kondo\ninsulators are understood in terms of a lattice of local moments coupled to\nconduction electrons in a half-filled band, i.e., with a dense population of\nabout one electron per unit cell. Here, we propose that a new class of Kondo\ninsulator arises when the conduction-electron band is nearly empty ( or,\nequivalently, full ) . We demonstrated the effect through a honeycomb Anderson\nlattice model. In the empty carrier limit, spin-orbit coupling produces a gap\nin the hybridized heavy fermion band, thereby generating a topological Kondo\ninsulator. This state can be understood in terms of a nearby phase in the\noverall phase diagram, a Dirac-Kondo semimetal whose quasiparticle excitations\nexhibit a non-trivial Berry phase. Our results point to the dilute carrier\nlimit of the heavy-fermion systems as a new setting to study strongly\ncorrelated insulating and topological states.\n", "  By the thermofield dynamics (TFD) formalism we obtain the energy-momentum\ntensor for the Electromagnetism with Lorentz Breaking Even term of the Standard\nModel Extended (SME) Sector in a topology $S^{1}\\times S^{1}\\times R^{2}$. We\ncarry out the compactification by a generalized TFD-Bogoliubov transformation\nthat is used to define a renormalized energy-momentum tensor, and the Casimir\nenergy and pressure at finite temperature are then derived. A comparative\nanalysis with the electromagnetic case is developed, and we remark the\ninfluence of the background in the traditional Casimir effect.\n", "  Two-dimensional (2D) halide perovskites are emerging as promising candidates\nfor nano-electronics and optoelectronics. To realize their full potential, it\nis important to understand the role of those defects that can strongly impact\nmaterial properties. In contrast to other popular 2D semiconductors (e.g.\ntransition metal dichalcogenides MX2) for which defects typically induce\nharmful traps, we show that the electronic activities of defects in 2D\nperovskites are significantly tunable. For example, even with a fixed lattice\norientation, one can change the synthesis conditions to convert a line defect\n(edge or grain boundary) from electron acceptor to inactive site without deep\ngap states. We show that this difference originates from the enhanced ionic\nbonding in these perovskites compared with MX2. The donors tend to have high\nformation energies, and the harmful defects are difficult to form at a low\nhalide chemical potential. Thus we unveil unique properties of defects in 2D\nperovskites and suggest practical routes to improve them.\n", "  The Kilodegree Extremely Little Telescope (KELT) survey is a ground-based\nprogram designed to search for transiting exoplanets orbiting relatively bright\nstars. To achieve this, the KELT Science Team operates two planets facilities -\nKELT-North, at Winer Observatory, Arizona, and KELT-South, at the South African\nAstronomical Observatory. The telescopes used at these observatories have\nparticularly wide fields of view, allowing KELT to study a large number of\npotential exoplanet host stars. One of the major advantages of targeting bright\nstars is that the exoplanet candidates detected can be easily followed up by\nsmall, ground-based observatories distributed around the world. This paper will\nprovide a brief overview of the KELT-North and the KELT-South surveys, the\nfollow-up observations preformed by the KELT Follow-up Collaboration, and\nexoplanet discoveries confirmed thus far, before concluding with a brief\ndiscussion of the future for the KELT program.\n", "  We apply the second-order Israel-Stewart theory of relativistic fluid- and\nthermodynamics to a physically realistic model of a radiative fluid in a simple\nanisotropic cosmological background. We investigate the asymptotic future of\nthe resulting cosmological model and review the role of the dissipative\nphenomena in the early Universe. We demonstrate that the transport properties\nof the fluid alone, if described appropriately, do not explain the presently\nobserved accelerated expansion of the Universe. Also, we show that, in\nconstrast to the mathematical fluid models widely used before, the radiative\nfluid does approach local thermal equilibrium at late times, although very\nslowly, due to the cosmological expansion.\n", "  Trapping macromolecules in nanopits finds multifarious applications in\npolymer separation, filtering biomolecules etc. However, tuning the locomotion\nof polymers in channels of nanoscopic dimensions is greatly restricted by the\ncomparative advective and diffusive components of velocities. Using the polymer\naffinity toward the solvent and the wall, and the polymer structure, a\nmechanism is proposed to induce selective trapping of polymers. Similar to\nfractional distillation of hydrocarbons based on molecular weight, a technique\nof fractional segregation, depending on the channel wettability of polymeric\nchains at different depths in a pit that is located perpendicular to the flow\nis suggested. Depending on the properties of the polymeric chains and the\nsurface chemistry, the segregation of the polymer at a particular level in the\npit can be predicted. This behaviour stems from the difference in polymer\nstructure leading to a competition between wettability based trapping and\nentropic trapping. The results of this study suggest a novel way of separating\nbiopolymers based on their structure without relying on the channel geometry.\n", "  Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia accompanied with\nbrain atrophy. Structural measurements of brain atrophy in specific brain\nstructures such as hippocampus using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have been\nreported to detect the development of dementia early in the course of the\ndisease. The purpose of this study was to develop a computer-aided diagnostic\nsystem for AD using MRI, which is based on the automatic volumetry of segmented\nbrain images and generation of three-dimensional cortical thickness images\nusing the Eulerian partial differential equation (PDE) approach. We\ninvestigated the effect of the inhomogeneity of magnetic field strength and\nstatistical noise on the accuracy of our automatic volumetry and the PDE\napproach using the simulated MR images generated from BrainWeb. Our automatic\nvolumetry and PDE approach were robust against inhomogeneous magnetic field\nstrength. Although the accuracy of our automatic volumetry decreased with\nincreasing statistical noise, it was maintained when the statistical noise was\nless than 7-8%. The cortical thickness obtained by the PDE method tended to\ndecrease with increasing statistical noise. When we applied our method to\nclinical data, the cortical thinning due to brain atrophy was clearly\ndemonstrated in patients with brain atrophy. These results suggest that our\nsystem appears to be useful for the diagnosis of AD, because it allows us to\nautomatically evaluate the extent of brain atrophy and cortical thinning in a\nthree-dimensional manner.\n", "  Sampling is the first step to convert an analogue optical signal into a\ndigital electrical signal. The latter can be further processed and analysed by\nwell-known electrical signal processing methods. Optical pulse sources like\nmode-locked lasers are commonly incorporated for all-optical sampling, but have\nseveral drawbacks. A novel approach for a simple all-optical sampling is to\nutilise the frequency-time coherence of each signal. The method is based on\nonly using two coupled modulators driven with an electrical sine wave, allowing\nsimple integration in appropriate platforms, such as Silicon Photonics. The\npresented method grants all-optical sampling with electrically tunable\nbandwidth, repetition rate and time shift.\n", "  Hamiltonian dynamics are characterized by a function, called the Hamiltonian,\nand a Poisson bracket. The Hamiltonian is a conserved quantity due to the\nanti-symmetry of the Poisson bracket. The Poisson bracket satisfies the Jacobi\nidentity which is usually more intricate and more complex to comprehend than\nthe conservation of the Hamiltonian. Here we investigate the importance of the\nJacobi identity in the dynamics by considering three different types of\nconservative flows in R3 : Hamiltonian, almost-Poisson and metriplectic. The\ncomparison of their dynamics reveals the importance of the Jacobi identity in\nstructuring the resulting phase space.\n", "  Interfacial hydrodynamic slippage of water depends on both on surface\nchemistry and roughness. This study tries to connect the effect of chemical\nproperty and the physical structure of the surface on the interfacial slippage\nof water. By performing molecular dynamics simulations (MDS) of Couette flow of\nwater molecules over a reduced Lennard-Jones (LJ) surface, the velocity profile\nis obtained and extrapolated to get the slip lengths. The slip lengths are\nmeasured for various surface-fluid interactions. These interactions are varied\nby changing the wettability of the surface (characterized by the static contact\nangle) and its roughness. The slip length variation with the static contact\nangle as $(1+cos\\theta)^{-2}$ is observed. However, it is also observed that\nthe presence of surface roughness always reduces the slip length and it is\nproposed that the slip length varies with non-dimensionalized average surface\nroughness as $(1+\\alpha^*)^{-2}$ . Thus a relation between the chemical\nwettability and the physical roughness is established and their coupled\ninteractions modifying slip length is probed.\n", "  We report LHC measurements of single $W$ and $Z$ boson production at\ndifferent centre-of-mass energies. Together, the ATLAS, CMS, and LHCb detectors\ncover an absolute rapidity range from 0 to 4.5, enabling precision tests and\nstudies of Standard Model physics across different kinematic regions. We report\ntotal, fiducial and differential cross-section measurements and their ratios.\nThese results allow tests of the performance of different parton distribution\nfunctions (PDFs), and can be used to further constrain the PDFs. In addition,\nthe results are compared to theoretical predictions which use different\napproaches to model effects within quantum chromodynamics. We also report\nmeasurements of the forward-backward asymmetry in $Z$ boson decays, and\nmeasurements of angular coefficients, which provide sensitivity to the\nelectroweak mixing angle.\n", "  We have fabricated rhenium microwave resonators from epitaxial films. We have\nused thin films of different structural quality depending on their growth\nconditions. The resonators were coupled to a microwave transmission line which\nallows the measurement of their resonance frequencies and internal quality\nfactors. From the resonance frequency at low temperature , the effective\npenetration depth and the London penetration depth of the rhenium film are\nextracted.\n", "  We study the cubic- (focusing-)quintic (defocusing) nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger\nequation in two transverse dimensions. We discuss a family of stationary\ntraveling waves, including rarefaction pulses and vortexantivortex pairs, in a\nbackground of critical amplitude. We show that these rarefaction pulses can be\ngenerated inside a flattop soliton when a smaller bright soliton collides with\nit. The fate of the evolution strongly depends on the relative phase of the\nsolitons. Among several possibilities, we find that the dark pulse can reemerge\nas a bright soliton.\n", "  A numerical model able to simulate solid-state constrained sintering is\npresented. The model couples an existing kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) model for\nfree sintering with a finite element model (FEM) for calculating stresses on a\nmicrostructural level. The microstructural response to the local stress as well\nas the FEM calculation of the stress field from the microstructural evolution\nis discussed. The sintering behavior of a sample constrained by a rigid\nsubstrate is simulated. The constrained sintering results in a larger number of\npores near the substrate, as well as anisotropic sintering shrinkage, with\nsignificantly enhanced strain in the central upper part of the sample surface,\nand minimal strain at the edges near the substrate. All these features have\nalso previously been observed experimentally.\n", "  The total cost of a 25 W average load magnetic refrigerator using commercial\ngrade Gd is calculated using a numerical model. The price of magnetocaloric\nmaterial, magnet material and cost of operation are considered, and all\ninfluence the total cost. The lowest combined total cost with a device lifetime\nof 15 years is found to be in the range \\$150-\\$400 depending on the price of\nthe magnetocaloric and magnet material. The cost of the magnet is largest,\nfollowed closely by the cost of operation, while the cost of the magnetocaloric\nmaterial is almost negligible. For the lowest cost device, the optimal magnetic\nfield is about 1.4 T, the particle size is 0.23 mm, the length of the\nregenerator is 40-50 mm and the utilization is about 0.2, for all device\nlifetimes and material and magnet prices, while the operating frequency vary as\nfunction of device lifetime. The considered performance characteristics are\nbased on the performance of a conventional A$^{+++}$ refrigeration unit. In a\nrough life time cost comparison between the magnetic refrigeration device and\nsuch a unit we find similar costs, the former being slightly cheaper, assuming\nthe cost of the magnet can be recuperated at end of life.\n", "  An experimental realization of a heat exchanger with commercial\nthermoelectric generators (TEGs) is presented. The power producing capabilities\nas a function of flow rate and temperature span are characterized for two\ndifferent commercial heat transfer fluids and for three different thermal\ninterface materials. The device is shown to produce 2 W per TEG or 0.22 W\ncm$^{-2}$ at a fluid temperature difference of 175 $^\\circ$C and a flow rate\nper fluid channel of 5 L min$^{-1}$. One experimentally realized design\nproduced 200 W in total from 100 TEGs. For the design considered here, the\npower production is shown to depend more critically on the fluid temperature\nspan than on the fluid flow rate. Finally, the temperature span across the TEG\nis shown to be 55% to 75% of the temperature span between the hot and cold\nfluids.\n", "  The logical line is traced of formulation of theory of mechanics founded on\nthe basic correlations of mathematics of hypercomplex numbers and associated\ngeometric images. Namely, it is shown that the physical equations of quantum,\nclassical and relativistic mechanics can be regarded as mathematical\nconsequences of a single condition of stability of exceptional algebras of\nreal, complex and quaternion numbers under transformations of primitive\nconstituents of their units and elements. In the course of the study a notion\nof basic fractal surface underlying the physical three-dimensional space is\nintroduces, and an original geometric treatment (admitting visualization) of\nsome formerly considered abstract functions (mechanical action, space-time\ninterval) are suggested.\n", "  I proffer a development of some third order equation of motion for the free\nrelativistic top from the simultaneously imposed assumptions of variationality\nand Lorentz symmetry.\n", "  There is a persistent confusion about determinism and predictability. In\nspite of the opinions of some eminent philosophers (e.g., Popper), it is\npossible to understand that the two concepts are completely unrelated. In few\nwords we can say that determinism is ontic and has to do with how Nature\nbehaves, while predictability is epistemic and is related to what the human\nbeings are able to compute. An analysis of the Lyapunov exponents and the\nKolmogorov-Sinai entropy shows how deterministic chaos, although with an\nepistemic character, is non subjective at all. This should clarify the role and\ncontent of stochastic models in the description of the physical world.\n", "  The aim of this paper is to study and classify the multiplicity of\ndistinguished limits and asymptotic solutions for the advection equation with a\ngeneral oscillating velocity field with the systematic use of the two-timing\nmethod. Our results are:\n  (i) the dimensionless advection equation contains two independent small\nparameters, which represent the ratio of two characteristic time-scales and the\nspatial amplitudes of oscillations; the scaling of the variables and parameters\ncontains Strouhal number;\n  (ii) an infinite sequence of distinguished limits has been identified; this\nsequence corresponds to the successive degenerations of a drift velocity;\n  (iii) we have derived the averaged and oscillatory equations for the first\nfour distinguished limits; derivations are performed up to the forth orders in\nsmall parameters;\n  (v) we have shown, that each distinguish limit solution generates an infinite\nnumber of parametric solutions; these solutions differ from each other by the\nslow time-scale and the amplitude of prescribed velocity;\n  (vi) we have discovered the inevitable appearance of pseudo-diffusion, which\nappears as a Lie derivative of the averaged tensor of quadratic displacements;\nwe have clarified the meaning of pseudo-diffusion using a simple example;\n  (vii) our main methodological result is the introduction of a logical order\ninto the area and classification of an infinite number of asymptotic solutions;\nwe hope that it can help to study the similar problems for more complex\nsystems;\n  (viii) since in our calculations we do not employ any additional assumptions,\nour study can be used as a test for the validity of the two-timing hypothesis;\n  (ix) the averaged equations for five different types of oscillating velocity\nfields have been considered as the examples of different drifts and\npseudo-diffusion.\n", "  Several different versions of couple stress theory have appeared in the\nliterature, including the indeterminate Mindlin-Tiersten-Koiter couple stress\ntheory (MTK-CST), indeterminate symmetric modified couple stress theory (M-CST)\nand determinate skew-symmetric consistent couple stress theory (C-CST). First,\nthe solutions within each of these theories for pure torsion of cylindrical\nbars composed of isotropic elastic material are presented and found to provide\na remarkable basis for comparison with observed physical response. In\nparticular, recent novel physical experiments to characterize torsion of\nmicro-diameter copper wires in quasi-static tests show no significant size\neffect in the elastic range. This result agrees with the prediction of the\nskew-symmetric C-CST that there is no size effect for torsion of an elastic\ncircular bar in quasi-static loading, because the mean curvature tensor\nvanishes in a pure twist deformation. On the other hand, solutions within the\nother two theories exhibit size-dependent torsional response, which depends\nupon either one or two additional material parameters, respectively, for the\nindeterminate symmetric M-CST or indeterminate MTK-CST. Results are presented\nto illustrate the magnitude of the expected size-dependence within these two\ntheories in torsion. Interestingly, if the material length scales for copper in\nthese two theories with size-dependent torsion is on the order of microns or\nlarger, then the recent physical experiments in torsion would align only with\nthe self-consistent skew-symmetric couple stress theory, which inherently shows\nno size effect.\n", "  Physical interpretation of Lie algebra of de Sitter group is given for Snyder\ntheory of quantum space-time. Feasible means of its experimental validation are\npointed out.\n", "  The single-layer black phosphorus is characteristic for its puckered\nconfiguration that possesses the hinge-like mechanism, which leads to the\nhighly anisotropic in-plane Poisson's ratios and the negative out-of-plane\nPoisson's ratio. We reveal that the hinge-like mechanism can be attributed to\nthe angle-angle cross interaction, which, combined with the bond stretching and\nangle bending interactions, is able to provide a good description of the\nmechanical properties in the single-layer black phosphorus. We also propose a\nnonlinear angle-angle cross interaction, which follows the form of the\nStillinger-Weber potential and is advantageous for molecular dynamics\nsimulations of single-layer black phosphorous under large deformations.\n", "  In this short presentation, we address two somewhat separate issues. The\nfirst one deals with the establishment (vs discovery) of what we call \"physical\nlaws\". The discussion runs on a \"successive approximations\" approach, suited to\nour own thinking process, and aiming at the \"simplest \\emph{possible}\nformulation \", as opposed to the idea of pre-existing laws to be discovered. In\nthe second part, we review briefly an approach to the (observed) metric\noriginating from a short distance fractal structure, and remind how a\nsymmetrical situation can arise from mere re-summations.\n", "  Application of electron cooling at ion energies above a few GeV has been\nlimited due to reduction of electron cooling efficiency with energy and\ndifficulty in producing and accelerating a high-current high-quality electron\nbeam. A high-current storage-ring electron cooler offers a solution to both of\nthese problems by maintaining high cooling beam quality through\nnaturally-occurring synchrotron radiation damping of the electron beam.\nHowever, the range of ion energies where storage-ring electron cooling can be\nused has been limited by low electron beam damping rates at low ion energies\nand high equilibrium electron energy spread at high ion energies. This paper\nreports a development of a storage ring based cooler consisting of two sections\nwith significantly different energies: the cooling and damping sections. The\nelectron energy and other parameters in the cooling section are adjusted for\noptimum cooling of a stored ion beam. The beam parameters in the damping\nsection are adjusted for optimum damping of the electron beam. The necessary\nenergy difference is provided by an energy recovering SRF structure. A\nprototype linear optics of such storage-ring cooler and initial tracking\nsimulations are presented and some potential issues such as coherent\nsynchrotron radiation and beam break up are discussed.\n", "  A model describing the electronic transitions in an atom subject to a strong\nhigh frequency laser pulse is proposed in the velocity gauge. The model\naccounts for the initial state coupling with the the remaining discrete and\ncontinuum spectra. Continuum-continuum transitions are also taken into account\nfollowing well known strong-field approximation. A single integro-differential\nequation for the initial state amplitude has been obtained. Exact numerical\nsolutions of this equation are computed and compared with the full time\ndependent Schr{\\\"o}dinger equation solution for Hydrogen atoms. The initial\nstate amplitude is well described by two versions of the model: with and\nwithout the continuum-continuum coupling model. However the electron energy\nspectrum is only well described when the model accounts for the coupling\nbetween continuum states. Improvement on SFA arise from using Coulomb final\nwave function as well as regarding the initial state probability depletion.\n", "  Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) defect in diamond is a very promising tool for numerous\nsensing applications like magnetometry or thermometry. In this paper, we\ndemonstrate a compact and convenient device for magnetic field imaging where a\ncommercial single mode photonic crystal fibre is directly coupled to a\ncommercial CVD ppm diamond. We managed to excite and detect efficiently the\nluminescence from an ensemble of NV centres and also to perform Electron Spin\nResonance (ESR) experiments where the NV hyperfine structure is perfectly\nresolved under continuous excitation and measurement.\n", "  The co-evolution between network structure and functional performance is a\nfundamental and challenging problem whose complexity emerges from the intrinsic\ninterdependent nature of structure and function. Within this context, we\ninvestigate the interplay between the efficiency of network navigation (i.e.,\npath lengths) and network structure (i.e., edge weights). We propose a simple\nand tractable model based on iterative biased random walks where edge weights\nincrease over time as function of the traversed path length. Under mild\nassumptions, we prove that biased random walks will eventually only traverse\nshortest paths in their journey towards the destination. We further\ncharacterize the transient regime proving that the probability to traverse\nnon-shortest paths decays according to a power-law. We also highlight various\nproperties in this dynamic, such as the trade-off between exploration and\nconvergence, and preservation of initial network plasticity. We believe the\nproposed model and results can be of interest to various domains where biased\nrandom walks and decentralized navigation have been applied.\n", "  We discuss the possibility of emitting vector solitons from a two-component\nelongated BEC by manipulating in time the inter- or intra-species scattering\nlengths with Feshbach resonance tuning. We present different situations which\ndo not have an analogue in the single species case. In particular, we show\nvector soliton out-coupling by tuning the interspecies forces, how the\nevolution in one species is controlled by tuning the dynamics of the other, and\nhow one can implement the so-called supersolitons. The analysis is performed by\nnumerical simulations of the one-dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii equation. Simple\nanalytic arguments are also presented in order to give a qualitative insight.\n", "  We present two simple designs of matter-wave beam splitters in a trapped\nBose-Einstein Condensate (BEC). In our scheme, identical pairs of atomic\nsolitons are produced by an adequate control --- in time and/or space --- of\nthe scattering length. Our analysis is performed by numerical integration of\nthe Gross-Pitaevskii equation and supported by several analytic estimates. Our\nresults show that these devices can be implemented in the frame of current BEC\nexperiments. The system has potential applications for the construction of a\nsoliton interferometer.\n", "  Cooperation is observed widely in nature and is thought an essential\ncomponent of many evolutionary processes, yet the mechanisms by which it arises\nand persists are still unclear. Among several theories, network reciprocity --\na model of inhomogeneous social interactions -- has been proposed as an\nenabling mechanism to explain the emergence of cooperation. Existing\nevolutionary models of this mechanism have tended to focus on highly\nheterogeneous (scale-free) networks, hence typically assume preferential\nattachment mechanisms, and consequently the prerequisite that individuals have\nglobal network knowledge. Within an evolutionary game theoretic context, using\nthe weak prisoner's dilemma as a metaphor for cooperation, we present a minimal\nmodel which describes network growth by chronological random addition of new\nnodes, combined with regular attrition of less fit members of the population.\nSpecifically our model does not require that agents have access to global\ninformation and does not assume scale-free network structure or a preferential\nattachment mechanism. Further our model supports the emergence of cooperation\nfrom initially non-cooperative populations. By reducing dependency on a number\nof assumptions, this model offers broad applicability and as such may support\nan explanation of the emergence of cooperation in early evolutionary\ntransitions, where few assumptions can be made.\n", "  Much research has been carried out to understand the emergence of cooperation\nin simulated social networks of competing individuals. Such research typically\nimplements a population as a single connected network. Here we adopt a more\nrealistic premise; namely that populations consist of multiple networks, whose\nmembers migrate from one to another. Specifically, we isolate the key elements\nof the scenario where a minority of members from a cooperative network migrate\nto a network populated by defectors. Using the public goods game to model\ngroup-wise cooperation, we find that under certain circumstances, the concerted\nactions of a trivial number of such migrants will catalyse widespread\nbehavioural change throughout an entire population. Such results support a\nwider argument: that the general presence of some form of disruption\ncontributes to the emergence of cooperation in social networks, and\nconsequently that simpler models may encode a determinism that precludes the\nemergence of cooperation.\n", "  The many decisions people make about what to pay attention to online shape\nthe spread of information in online social networks. Due to the constraints of\navailable time and cognitive resources, the ease of discovery strongly impacts\nhow people allocate their attention to social media content. As a consequence,\nthe position of information in an individual's social feed, as well as explicit\nsocial signals about its popularity, determine whether it will be seen, and the\nlikelihood that it will be shared with followers. Accounting for these\ncognitive limits simplifies mechanics of information diffusion in online social\nnetworks and explains puzzling empirical observations: (i) information\ngenerally fails to spread in social media and (ii) highly connected people are\nless likely to re-share information. Studies of information diffusion on\ndifferent social media platforms reviewed here suggest that the interplay\nbetween human cognitive limits and network structure differentiates the spread\nof information from other social contagions, such as the spread of a virus\nthrough a population.\n", "  In the standard treatment of heterogeneous nucleation on a surface, the\nenergy of the surface is assumed to be homogeneous. Often its value is obtained\nfrom some macroscopic measurement. We ask the question what happens if we\nconsider the surface energy to be heterogeneous. This is a straightforward\ngeneralization and may realistically be important in a number of scenarios,\ne.g. when the phase forming the surface is a binary alloy, solid solution, in\npresence of self-organized or artifically created patterns on the surface. We\nexamine the effects of surface heterogeneity in a few scenarios in a model\nsystem, 3D lattice Ising model. Utilizing umbrella sampling computer\nsimulations we find the nucleation barrier can be significantly lowered in\npresence of surface heterogeneity, even if the average surface energy is kept\nconstant.\n", "  Ordered binary and ternary photonic crystals, composed of different sized\npolymer-composite spheres with diameter ratios up to 120%, are generated using\nbending induced oscillatory shearing (BIOS). This viscoelastic system creates\npolydisperse equilibrium structures, producing mixed opaline colored films with\ngreatly reduced requirements for particle monodispersity, and very different\nsphere size ratios, compared to other methods of nano-assembly.\n", "  We present the activities of the 'New Physics' working group for the 'Physics\nat TeV Colliders' workshop (Les Houches, France, 1-19 June, 2015). Our report\nincludes new physics studies connected with the Higgs boson and its properties,\ndirect search strategies, reinterpretation of the LHC results in the building\nof viable models and new computational tool developments. Important signatures\nfor searches for natural new physics at the LHC and new assessments of the\ninterplay between direct dark matter searches and the LHC are also considered.\n", "  The quantitative lateral resolution is a reliable measure for the quality of\nan XPS microprobe equipped with a focused X-ray beam. It describes the long\ntail contributions of the X-ray beam intensity distribution. The knowledge of\nthese long tail contributions is essential when judging on the origin of\nsignals of XPS spectra recorded on small-sized features. In this round robin\ntest the quantitative lateral resolution of 7 PHI XPS microprobes has been\nestimated. As expected, the quantitative lateral resolution has significantly\nlarger values than the nominal X-ray beam diameter. The estimated values of the\nquantitative lateral resolution follow a trend in time: The newer the\nmonochromator of an XPS microprobe so much the better the quantitative lateral\nresolution.\n", "  In spite of alleged impossibility proofs, \"simple derivations\" of the\nSchwarzschild metric, based solely on Einstein's equivalence principle and\nNewton's free fall velocity formula, are presented.\n", "  A second rank antisymmetric tensor field is proposed as an alternative to the\nHiggs scalar. No mass term is allowed by the symmetries. At the scale where the\nasymptotically free chiral couplings of the fermions grow large, condensates of\ntop-antitop and bottom-antibottom may induce the spontaneous breaking of the\nelectroweak gauge symmetry. This would solve the gauge hierarchy problem by\ndimensional transmutation, similar to QCD.\n", "  We construct a canonical embedding of the Schwartz space on $R^n$ to the\nspace of distributions on the adelic product of all the $p$-adic numbers. This\nmap is equivariant with respect to the action of the symplectic group $Sp(2n,\nQ)$ over rational numbers and with respect to the action of the rational\nHeisenberg group.\n", "  Mirror symmetry suggests that on a Calabi-Yau 3-fold moduli spaces of stable\nbundles, especially those with degree zero and indivisible Chern class, might\nbe smooth (i.e. unobstructed, though perhaps of too high a dimension). This is\nbecause smoothly embedded special lagrangian cycles in the mirror have\nunobstructed deformations. As there does not seem to be a counterexample in the\nliterature we provide one here, showing that such a Tian-Todorov-McLean-type\nresult cannot hold.\n", "  We propose a detection scheme for measuring the overlap of the quantum state\nof a weakly excited traveling-field mode with a desired reference quantum\nstate, by successive mixing the signal mode with modes prepared in coherent\nstates and performing photon-number measurements in an array of beam splitters.\nTo illustrate the scheme, we discuss the measurement of the quantum phase and\nthe detection of Schrodinger-cat-like states.\n"]}
