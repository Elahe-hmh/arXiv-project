Once the\nDecoherence Free Regime is reached, transient entanglement tends to become\nstationary and, therefore, usable for quantum gate implementation.\n", "  We introduce economic models based on Boolean Delay Equations: this formalism\nmakes easier to take into account the complexity of the interactions between\nfirms and is particularly appropriate for studying the propagation of an\ninitial damage due to a catastrophe. Here we concentrate on simple cases, which\nallow to understand the effects of multiple concurrent production paths as well\nas the presence of stochasticity in the path time lengths or in the network\nstructure.\n  In absence of flexibility, the shortening of production of a single firm in\nan isolated network with multiple connections usually ends up by attaining a\nfinite fraction of the firms or the whole economy, whereas the interactions\nwith the outside allow a partial recovering of the activity, giving rise to\nperiodic solutions with waves of damage which propagate across the structure.\nThe damage propagation speed is strongly dependent upon the topology. The\nexistence of multiple concurrent production paths does not necessarily imply a\nslowing down of the propagation, which can be as fast as the shortest path.\n", "  Rotor Router models were first introduced by James Propp in 2002. A recurrent\nRotor configuration is the one in which every state is visited infinitely\noften. In this project we investigated whether there is a recurrent Rotor\nconfiguration in Z^d (d>2).\n", "  We give an alternative description of the data produced in the KamLAND\nexperiment, assuming the existence of a natural nuclear reactor on the boundary\nof the liquid and solid phases of the Earth's core. Analyzing the uncertainty\nof antineutrino spectrum of georeactor origin, we show that the theoretical\n(which takes into account the soliton-like nuclear georeactor) total reactor\nantineutrino spectra describe with good accuracy the experimental KamLAND-data\nover the years of 2002-2007 and 2002-2009, respectively. At the same time the\nparameters of mixing ({\\Delta}(m21)^2=2.5\\cdot 10^-5 eV^2,\ntan^2{\\theta}12=0.437) calculated within the framework of georeactor hypothesis\nsubstantially differ from the parameters of mixing ({\\Delta}(m21)^2=7.49\\cdot\n10^-5 eV^2, tan^2{\\theta}12=0.436) obtained in KamLAND-experiment for total\nexposure over the period of 2002-2009. By traingulation of KamLAND and Borexino\ndata we have constructed the coordinate location of soliton-like nuclear\ngeoreactors on the boundary of the liquid and solid phases of the Earth core.\nBased on the necessary condition of full synchronization of geological\n(magnetic) time scale and time evolution of heat power of nuclear georeactor,\nwhich plays the role of energy source of the Earth magnetic field, and also the\nstrong negative correlation between magnetic field of the solar tachocline zone\nand magnetic field of the Earth liquid core (Y-component) we have obtain the\nestimation of nuclear georeactor average heat power ~30 TW over the years\n2002-2009.\n", "  The gluon field distribution between three infinitely spaced quarks is\nobtained. The field distribution between every pair is approximated by an\ninfinite flux tube filled with a color longitudinal electric field. The origin\nof the color electric field is a nonlinear term in the field strength of\nnonabelian gauge field. Such construction can be considered as a rough model of\nthree quarks in a nucleon.\n", "  Experimental data from the National Air Surveillance Network of Japan from\n1974 to 1996 and from independent measurements performed simultaneously in the\nregions of Ljubljana (Slovenia), Odessa (Ukraine) and the Ukrainian\n\"Academician Vernadsky\" Antarctic station (64{\\deg}15'W; 65{\\deg}15'S), where\nthe air elemental composition was determined by the standard method of\natmospheric particulate matter (PM) collection on nucleopore filters and\nsubsequent neutron activation analysis, were analyzed. Comparative analysis of\ndifferent pairs of atmospheric PM element concentration data sets, measured in\ndifferent regions of the Earth, revealed a stable linear (on a logarithmic\nscale) correlation, showing a power law increase of every atmospheric PM\nelement mass and simultaneously the cause of this increase - fractal nature of\natmospheric PM genesis. Within the framework of multifractal geometry we show\nthat the mass (volume) distribution of atmospheric PM elemental components is a\nlog normal distribution, which on a logarithmic scale with respect to the\nrandom variable (elemental component mass) is identical to normal distribution.\nThis means that the parameters of two-dimensional normal distribution with\nrespect to corresponding atmospheric PM-multifractal elemental components\nmeasured in different regions, are a priory connected by equations of direct\nand inverse linear regression, and the experimental manifestation of this fact\nis the linear correlation between the concentrations of the same elemental\ncomponents in different sets of experimental atmospheric PM data.\n", "  We solve the 2D Dirac equation describing graphene in the presence of a\nlinear vector potential. The discretization of the transverse momentum due to\nthe infinite mass boundary condition reduced our 2D Dirac equation to an\neffective massive 1D Dirac equation with an effective mass equal to the\nquantized transverse momentum. We use both a numerical Poincare Map approach,\nbased on space discretization of the original Dirac equation, and direct\nanalytical method. These two approaches have been used to study tunneling\nphenomena through a biased graphene strip. The numerical results generated by\nthe Poincare Map are in complete agreement with the analytical results.\n", "  We study the tunneling of Dirac fermions in graphene through a double barrier\npotential allowing the carriers to have an effective mass inside the barrier as\ngenerated by a lattice miss-match with the boron nitride substrate. The\nconsequences of this gap opening on the transmission are investigated. The\nrealization of resonant tunneling conditions is also analyzed.\n", "  We study a two dimensional system of electrons with Rashba coupling in the\nconstant magnetic field $B$ and confining potential. We algebraically\ndiagonalize the corresponding Hamiltonian to end up with the solutions of the\nenergy spectrum. In terms of two kinds of operator we construct two symmetries\nand discuss the filling of the shells with electrons for strong and weak $B$.\nSubsequently, we show that our system is sharing some common features with\nquantum optics where the exact operator solutions for the basics\nJaynes-Cummings variables are derived from our results. An interesting limit is\nstudied and the corresponding quantum dynamics is recovered.\n", "  In the present work, we study the noncommutative version of a quantum\ncosmology model. The model has a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker geometry, the\nmatter content is a radiative perfect fluid and the spatial sections have\npositive constant curvatures. We work in the Schutz's variational formalism. We\nquantize the model and obtain the appropriate Wheeler-DeWitt equation. In this\nmodel the states are bounded. Therefore, we compute the discrete energy\nspectrum and the corresponding eigenfunctions. The energies depend on a\nnoncommutative parameter ($\\theta$). The solutions to the Wheeler-DeWitt\nequation are function of the scale factor ($a$) and a time variable ($\\tau$),\nassociated to the fluid. They also depend on an integer ($n$) and $\\theta$. The\nmost general solution ($\\Psi(a,\\tau)$) to the Wheeler-DeWitt equation is a sum,\nin the integer $n$, of the solutions mentioned above. We observe that, there is\nno $\\Psi(a,\\tau)$ satisfying the appropriate boundary conditions. Therefore, we\nconclude that it is not possible to obtain a wavefunction satisfying the\nappropriate boundary conditions for the present model with the considered\nnoncommutativity.\n", "  Two-component hyperbolic system of equations generated by ordinary\ndifferential Painlev\\'e I \\[ u_{yy}=6u^2+y \\] and Painlev\\'e III \\[\nyuu_{yy}=yu^2_{y}-uu_y+\\delta y+\\beta u+\\alpha u^3 +\\gamma yu^4 \\] equations\nare considered, where $\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma, \\delta$ are complex numbers. The\nstructure of characteristic Lie rings is studied and higher symmetries of\nLie-B\\\"acklund are obtained.\n", "  It is shown that the capture and fission cross-sections of 238U and 239Pu\nincrease with temperature within 1000-3000 K range, in contrast to those of\n235U, that under certain conditions may lead to the so-called blow-up modes,\nstimulating the anomalous neutron flux and nuclear fuel temperature growth.\nSome features of the blow-up regimes in neutron-multiplying media are\ndiscussed.\n", "  We present a systematic approach for the separation of variables for the\ntwo-dimensional Dirac equation in polar coordinates. The three vector\npotential, which couple to the Dirac spinor via minimal coupling, along with\nthe scalar potential are chosen to have angular dependence which emanate the\nDirac equation to complete separation of variables. Exact solutions are\nobtained for a class of solvable potentials along with their relativistic\nspinor wavefunctions. Particular attention is paid to the situation where the\npotentials are confined to a quantum dot region and are of scalar, vector and\npseudo-scalar type. The study of a single charged impurity embedded in a 2D\nDirac equation in the presence of a uniform magnetic field was treated as a\nparticular case of our general study.\n", "  We show the density of eigenvalues for three classes of random matrix\nensembles is determinantal. First we derive the density of eigenvalues of\nproduct of $k$ independent $n\\times n$ matrices with i.i.d. complex Gaussian\nentries with a few of matrices being inverted. In second example we calculate\nthe same for (compatible) product of rectangular matrices with i.i.d. Gaussian\nentries and in last example we calculate for product of independent truncated\nunitary random matrices. We derive exact expressions for limiting expected\nempirical spectral distributions of above mentioned ensembles.\n", "  In this paper we prove that given a weakly almost periodic measure $\\mu$\nsupported inside some model set $\\Lambda(W)$ with closed window $W$, then the\nstrongly almost periodic component $\\mu_S$ and the null weakly almost periodic\ncomponent $\\mu_0$ are both supported inside $\\Lambda(W)$. As a consequence we\nprove that given any translation bounded measure $\\omega$, supported inside\nsome model set, then each of the pure point diffraction spectrum\n$\\hat{\\gamma}_{pp}$ and the continuous diffraction spectrum $\\hat{\\gamma}_c$ is\neither trivial or have a relatively dense support.\n", "  We investigate entanglement transformations with stochastic local operations\nand classical communication (SLOCC) in an asymptotic setting using the concepts\nof degeneration and border rank of tensors from algebraic complexity theory.\nResults well-known in that field imply that GHZ states can be transformed into\nW states at rate 1 for any number of parties. As a generalization, we find that\nthe asymptotic conversion rate from GHZ states to Dicke states is bounded as\nthe number of subsystems increase and the number of excitations is fixed. By\ngeneralizing constructions of Coppersmith and Winograd and by using monotones\nintroduced by Strassen we also compute the conversion rate from W to GHZ\nstates.\n", "  In the present work, we study the noncommutative version of a quantum\ncosmology model. The model has a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker geometry, the\nmatter content is a radiative perfect fluid and the spatial sections have zero\nconstant curvature. In this model the scale factor takes values in a bounded\ndomain. Therefore, its quantum mechanical version has a discrete energy\nspectrum. We compute the discrete energy spectrum and the corresponding\neigenfunctions. The energies depend on a noncommutative parameter $\\beta$. We\ncompute the scale factor expected value ($\\left<a\\right>$) for several values\nof $\\beta$. For all of them, $\\left<a\\right>$ oscillates between maxima and\nminima values and never vanishes. It gives an initial indication that those\nmodels are free from singularities, at the quantum level. We improve this\nresult by showing that if we subtract a quantity proportional to the standard\ndeviation of $a$ from $\\left<a\\right>$, this quantity is still positive. The\n$\\left<a\\right>$ behavior, for the present model, is a drastic modification of\nthe $\\left<a\\right>$ behavior in the corresponding commutative version of the\npresent model. There, $\\left<a\\right>$ grows without limits with the time\nvariable. Therefore, if the present model may represent the early stages of the\nUniverse, the results of the present paper give an indication that\n$\\left<a\\right>$ may have been, initially, bounded due to noncommutativity. We\nalso compute the Bohmian trajectories for $a$, which are in accordance with\n$\\left<a\\right>$, and the quantum potential $Q$. From $Q$, we may understand\nwhy that model is free from singularities, at the quantum level.\n", "  We map the kinematics of stars in simulated galaxy disks with spiral arms\nusing the velocity ellipsoid vertex deviation (l$_v$). We use test particle\nsimulations, and for the first time, fully self-consistent high resolution\nN-body models. We compare our maps with the Tight Winding Approximation model\nanalytical predictions. We see that for all barred models spiral arms rotate\nclosely to a rigid body manner and the vertex deviation values correlate with\nthe density peaks position bounded by overdense and underdense regions. In such\ncases, vertex deviation sign changes from negative to positive when crossing\nthe spiral arms in the direction of disk rotation, in regions where the spiral\narms are in between corotation (CR) and the Outer Lindblad Resonance (OLR). By\ncontrast, when the arm sections are inside the CR and outside the OLR, l$_v$\nchanges from negative to positive.We propose that measurements of the vertex\ndeviations pattern can be used to trace the position of the main resonances of\nthe spiral arms. We propose that this technique might exploit future data from\nGaia and APOGEE surveys. For unbarred N-body simulations with spiral arms\ncorotating with disk material at all radii, our analysis suggests that no clear\ncorrelation exists between l$_v$ and density structures.\n", "  We establish a resonance free strip for codimension 2 symplectic normally\nhyperbolic trapped sets with smooth incoming/outgoing tails. An important\napplication is wave decay on Kerr and Kerr-de Sitter black holes. We recover\nthe optimal size of the strip and give an $o(h^{-2})$ resolvent bound there. We\nnext show existence of deeper resonance free strips under the $r$-normal\nhyperbolicity assumption and a pinching condition. We also give a lower bound\non the ne-sided cutoff resolvent on the real line.\n", "  We consider Dirac fermion confined in harmonic potential and submitted to a\nconstant magnetic field. The corresponding solutions of the energy spectrum are\nobtained by using the path integral techniques. For this, we begin by\nestablishing a symmetric global projection, which provides a symmetric form for\nthe Green function. Based on this, we show that it is possible to end up with\nthe propagator of the harmonic oscillator for one charged particle. After some\ntransformations, we derive the normalized wave functions and the eigenvalues in\nterms of different physical parameters and quantum numbers. By interchanging\nquantum numbers, we show that our solutions possed interesting properties. The\ndensity of current and the non-relativistic limit are analyzed where different\nconclusions are obtained.\n", "  We study the problem of obtaining de Sitter and inflationary vacua from\ndimensional reduction of double field theory (DFT) on nongeometric string\nbackgrounds. In this context, we consider a new class of effective potentials\nthat admit Minkowski and de Sitter minima. We then construct a simple model of\nchaotic inflation arising from T-fold backgrounds and we discuss the\npossibility of trans-Planckian field range from nongeometric monodromies as\nwell as the conditions required to get slow roll.\n", "  In this study, we describe how WRF-Sfire is coupled with WRF-Chem to\nconstruct WRFSC, an integrated forecast system for wildfire and smoke\nprediction. The integrated forecast system has the advantage of not requiring a\nsimple plume-rise model and assumptions about the size and heat release from\nthe fire in order to determine fire emissions into the atmosphere. With\nWRF-Sfire, wildfire spread, plume and plume-top heights are predicted directly,\nat every WRF timestep, providing comprehensive meteorology and fire emissions\nto the chemical transport model WRF-Chem. Evaluation of WRFSC was based on\ncomparisons between available observations to the results of two WRFSC\nsimulations. The study found overall good agreement between forecasted and\nobserved fire spread and smoke transport for the Witch-Guejito fire. Also the\nsimulated PM2.5 (fine particulate matter) peak concentrations matched the\nobservations. However, the NO and ozone levels were underestimated in the\nsimulations and the peak concentrations were mistimed. Determining the terminal\nor plume-top height is one of the most important aspects of simulating wildfire\nplume transport, and the study found overall good agreement between simulated\nand observed plume-top heights, with some (10% or less) underestimation by the\nsimulations. One of the most promising results of the study was the agreement\nbetween passive-tracer modeled plume-top heights for the Barker Canyon fire\nsimulation and observations. This simulation took only 13h, with the first 24h\nforecast ready in almost 3h, making it a possible operational tool for\nproviding emission profiles for external chemical transport models.\n", "  We prove Haag duality for conelike regions in the ground state representation\ncorresponding to the translational invariant ground state of Kitaev's quantum\ndouble model for finite abelian groups. This property says that if an\nobservable commutes with all observables localised outside the cone region, it\nactually is an element of the von Neumann algebra generated by the local\nobservables inside the cone. This strengthens locality, which says that\nobservables localised in disjoint regions commute.\n  As an application we consider the superselection structure of the quantum\ndouble model for abelian groups on an infinite lattice in the spirit of the\nDoplicher-Haag-Roberts program in algebraic quantum field theory. We find that,\nas is the case for the toric code model on an infinite lattice, the\nsuperselection structure is given by the category of irreducible\nrepresentations of the quantum double.\n", "  Fuel moisture has a major influence on the behavior of wildland fires and is\nan important underlying factor in fire risk assessment. We propose a method to\nassimilate dead fuel moisture content observations from remote automated\nweather stations (RAWS) into a time-lag fuel moisture model. RAWS are spatially\nsparse and a mechanism is needed to estimate fuel moisture content at locations\npotentially distant from observational stations. This is arranged using a trend\nsurface model (TSM), which allows us to account for the effects of topography\nand atmospheric state on the spatial variability of fuel moisture content. At\neach location of interest, the TSM provides a pseudo-observation, which is\nassimilated via Kalman filtering. The method is tested with the time-lag fuel\nmoisture model in the coupled weather-fire code WRF-SFIRE on 10-hr fuel\nmoisture content observations from Colorado RAWS in 2013. We show using\nleave-one-out testing that the TSM compares favorably with inverse squared\ndistance interpolation as used in the Wildland Fire Assessment System. Finally,\nwe demonstrate that the data assimilation method is able to improve fuel\nmoisture content estimates in unobserved fuel classes.\n", "  Some time ago Ranada (1989) obtained new nontrivial solutions of the\nMaxwellian gauge fields without sources. These were reinterpreted in Kholodenko\n(2015a) (part I) as particle-like (monopoles, dyons, etc.). They were obtained\nby the method of Abelian reduction of the non-Abelian Yang-Mills functional.\nThe developed method uses instanton-type calculations normally employed for the\nnon-Abelian gauge fields. By invoking the electric-magnetic duality it then\nbecomes possible to replace all known charges/masses by the particle -like\nsolutions of the source-free Abelian gauge fields. To employ these results in\nhigh energy physics, it is essential to to extend Ranada's results by carefully\nanalysing and classifying all dynamically generated knoted/linked structures in\ngauge fields, including those discovered by Ranada. This task is completed in\nthis work. The study is facilitated by the recent progress made in solving the\nMoffatt conjecture. Its essence is stated as follows: in steady incompressible\nEuler-type fluids the streamlines could have knots/links of all types. By\nemploying the correspondence between the ideal hydrodynamics and\nelectrodynamics discussed in part I and by superimposing it with the already\nmentioned method of Abelian reduction, it is demonstrated that in the absence\nof boundaries only the iterated torus knots and links could be dynamically\ngenerated. Obtained results allow to develop further particle-knot/link\ncorrespondence studied in Kholodenko (2015b)\n", "  In this paper we study the elastic response of synthetic hydrogels to an\napplied shear stress. The hydrogels studied here have previously been shown to\nmimic the behaviour of biopolymer networks when they are sufficiently far above\nthe gel point. We show that near the gel point they exhibit an elastic response\nthat is consistent with the predicted critical behaviour of networks near or\nbelow the isostatic point of marginal stability. This point separates rigid and\nfloppy states, distinguished by the presence or absence of finite linear\nelastic moduli. Recent theoretical work has also focused on the response of\nsuch networks to finite or large deformations, both near and below the\nisostatic point. Despite this interest, experimental evidence for the existence\nof criticality in such networks has been lacking. Using computer simulations,\nwe identify critical signatures in the mechanical response of sub-isostatic\nnetworks as a function of applied shear stress. We also present experimental\nevidence consistent with these predictions. Furthermore, our results show the\nexistence of two distinct critical regimes, one of which arises from the\nnonlinear stretch response of semi-flexible polymers..\n", "  We describe a method based on the CL$_s$ approach to present results in\nsearches of new physics, under the condition that the relevant parameter space\nis continuous. Our method relies on a class of test statistics developed for\nnon-nested hypotheses testing problems, denoted by $\\Delta T$, which has a\nGaussian approximation to its parent distribution when the sample size is\nlarge. This leads to a simple procedure of forming exclusion sets for the\nparameters of interest, which we call the Gaussian CL$_s$ method. Our work\nprovides a self-contained mathematical proof for the Gaussian CL$_s$ method,\nthat explicitly outlines the required conditions. These conditions are milder\nthan that required by the Wilks' theorem to set confidence intervals (CIs). We\nillustrate the Gaussian CL$_s$ method in an example of searching for a sterile\nneutrino, where the CL$_s$ approach was rarely used before. We also compare\ndata analysis results produced by the Gaussian CL$_s$ method and various CI\nmethods to showcase their differences.\n", "  Motivated by the question of stability, in this letter we argue that an\neffective \"quantum\" theory can emerge in complex adaptive systems. In the\nconcrete example of stochastic Lotka-Volterra dynamics, the relevant effective\n\"Planck constant\" associated with such emergent \"quantum\" theory has the\ndimensions of the square of the unit of time. Such an emergent quantum-like\ntheory has inherently non-classical stability as well as coherent properties\nthat are not, in principle, endangered by thermal fluctuations and therefore\nmight be of crucial importance in complex adaptive systems.\n", "  We compute the transmission probability through rectangular potential\nbarriers and p-n junctions in the presence of a magnetic and electric fields in\nbilayer graphene taking into account contributions from the full four bands of\nthe energy spectrum. For energy $E$ higher than the interlayer coupling\n$\\gamma_1$ ($E > \\gamma_1$) two propagation modes are available for transport\ngiving rise to four possible ways for transmission and reflection coefficients.\nHowever, when the energy is less than the height of the barrier the Dirac\nfermions exhibit transmission resonances and only one mode of propagation is\navailable for transport. We study the effect of the interlayer electrostatic\npotential denoted by $\\delta$ and variations of different barrier geometry\nparameters on the transmission probability.\n", "  We investigate compressibility of the dimension of positive semidefinite\nmatrices while approximately preserving their pairwise inner products. This can\neither be regarded as compression of positive semidefinite factorizations of\nnonnegative matrices or (if the matrices are subject to additional\nnormalization constraints) as compression of quantum models. We derive both\nlower and upper bounds on compressibility. Applications are broad and range\nfrom the statistical analysis of experimental data to bounding the one-way\nquantum communication complexity of Boolean functions.\n", "  For more than a century, cerebral cartography has been driven by\ninvestigations of structural and morphological properties of the brain across\nspatial scales and the temporal/functional phenomena that emerge from these\nunderlying features. The next era of brain mapping will be driven by studies\nthat consider both of these components of brain organization simultaneously --\nelucidating their interactions and dependencies. Using this guiding principle,\nwe explored the origin of slowly fluctuating patterns of synchronization within\nthe topological core of brain regions known as the rich club, implicated in the\nregulation of mood and introspection. We find that a constellation of densely\ninterconnected regions that constitute the rich club (including the anterior\ninsula, amygdala, and precuneus) play a central role in promoting a stable,\ndynamical core of spontaneous activity in the primate cortex. The slow time\nscales are well matched to the regulation of internal visceral states,\ncorresponding to the somatic correlates of mood and anxiety. In contrast, the\ntopology of the surrounding \"feeder\" cortical regions show unstable, rapidly\nfluctuating dynamics likely crucial for fast perceptual processes. We discuss\nthese findings in relation to psychiatric disorders and the future of\nconnectomics.\n", "  This work generalizes our previous works on fcc-bcc martensitic\ntransformations to the larger family of transformations in the fcc-bcc-hcp\nsystem and to fcc-fcc mechanical twinning. The analytical expressions of the\natomic displacements and lattice distortions are calculated directly from the\norientation relationships without any adjustment of free parameter; the unique\nassumption is that the atoms are hard-spheres that cannot interpenetrate\nthemselves. The habit planes are predicted on the simple criterion that they\nare unrotated by the distortion, and the results are compared to experimental\nobservations published in literature. It is shown that shuffle is required for\ntransformations implying the hcp phase because the hcp primitive Bravais\nlattice contains two atoms, instead of one for the fcc and bcc phases. A simple\nencoding of the lattice distortions and shuffles permits to attribute a\ngroupoid structure to the transformations in the fcc-hcp-bcc system. The\nanalytical expressions of the intermediate states are given and could be used\nto calculate activation energies. The martensitic distortion occurs in\none-step, without shearing, and its accommodation generates orientation\ngradients in the parent phase, independently of its glide modes. The concept of\nreversibility is detailed on the basis of crystallographic and morphological\narguments. The possibility to apply this approach to diffusion-limited\nmartensitic transformations is discussed.\n", "  We study a modified Kac model where the classical kinetic energy is replaced\nby an arbitrary energy function $\\phi(v)$, $v \\in \\mathbb{R}$. The aim of this\npaper is to show that the uniform density with respect to the microcanonical\nmeasure is $Ce^{-z_0\\phi(v)}$-chaotic, $C,z_0 \\in \\mathbb{R}_+$. The kinetic\nenergy for relativistic particles is a special case. A generalization to the\ncase $v\\in \\mathbb{R}^d$ which involves conservation momentum is also formally\ndiscussed.\n", "  Languages across the world exhibit Zipf's law of abbreviation, namely more\nfrequent words tend to be shorter. The generalized version of the law - an\ninverse relationship between the frequency of a unit and its magnitude - holds\nalso for the behaviours of other species and the genetic code. The apparent\nuniversality of this pattern in human language and its ubiquity in other\ndomains calls for a theoretical understanding of its origins. To this end, we\ngeneralize the information theoretic concept of mean code length as a mean\nenergetic cost function over the probability and the magnitude of the types of\nthe repertoire. We show that the minimization of that cost function and a\nnegative correlation between probability and the magnitude of types are\nintimately related.\n", "  We argue that in addition to the Hall conductance and the nondissipative\ncomponent of the viscous tensor, there exists a third independent transport\ncoefficient, which is precisely quantized. It takes constant values along\nquantum Hall plateaus. We show that the new coefficient is the Chern number of\na vector bundle over moduli space of surfaces of genus 2 or higher and\ntherefore cannot change continuously along the plateau. As such, it does not\ntranspire on a sphere or a torus. In the linear response theory, this\ncoefficient determines intensive forces exerted on electronic fluid by\nadiabatic deformations of geometry and represents the effect of the\ngravitational anomaly. We also present the method of computing the transport\ncoefficients for quantum Hall states.\n", "  We discuss the relationship between the quantum Hall conductance and a\nfractal energy band structure, Hofstadter's butterfly, on a square lattice\nunder a magnetic field. At first, we calculate the Hall conductance of\nHofstadter's butterfly on the basis of the linear responce theory. By\nclassifying the bands into some groups with a help of continued fraction\nexpansion, we find that the conductance at the band gaps between the groups\naccord with the denominators of fractions obtained by aborting the expansion\nhalfway. The broadening of Landau levels is given as an account of this\ncorrespondance.\n", "  Recently, two-dimensional (2D) materials with strong in-plane anisotropic\nproperties such as black phosphorus have demonstrated great potential for\ndeveloping new devices that can take advantage of its reduced lattice symmetry\nwith potential applications in electronics, optoelectronics and\nthermoelectrics. However, the selection of 2D material with strong in-plane\nanisotropy has so far been very limited and only sporadic studies have been\ndevoted to transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDC) materials with reduced\nlattice symmetry, which is yet to convey the full picture of their optical and\nphonon properties, and the anisotropy in their interlayer interactions. Here,\nwe study the anisotropic interlayer interactions in an important TMDC 2D\nmaterial with reduced in-plane symmetry - atomically thin rhenium diselenide\n(ReSe2) - by investigating its ultralow frequency interlayer phonon vibration\nmodes, the layer dependent optical bandgap, and the anisotropic\nphotoluminescence (PL) spectra for the first time. The ultralow frequency\ninterlayer Raman spectra combined with the first study of polarization-resolved\nhigh frequency Raman spectra in mono- and bi-layer ReSe2 allows deterministic\nidentification of its layer number and crystal orientation. PL measurements\nshow anisotropic optical emission intensity with bandgap increasing from 1.26\neV in the bulk to 1.32 eV in monolayer, consistent with the theoretical results\nbased on first-principle calculations. The study of the layer-number dependence\nof the Raman modes and the PL spectra reveals the relatively weak van der Waals\ninteraction and 2D quantum confinement in atomically-thin ReSe2.\n", "  The bandstructures of [110] and [001] Bi2Te3 nanowires are solved with the\natomistic 20 band tight binding functionality of NEMO5. The theoretical results\nreveal: The popular assumption that all topological insulator wire surfaces are\nequivalent is inappropriate. The Fermi velocity of chemically distinct wire\nsurfaces differs significantly which creates an effective in-surface\nconfinement potential. As a result, topological insulator surface states prefer\nspecific surfaces. Therefore, experiments have to be designed carefully not to\nprobe surfaces unfavorable to the surface states (low density of states) and\nthereby be insensitive to the TI-effects.\n", "  As the volume of data grows, astronomers are increasingly faced with choices\non what data to keep -- and what to throw away. Recent work evaluating the\nJPEG2000 (ISO/IEC 15444) standards as a future data format standard in\nastronomy has shown promising results on observational data. However, there is\nstill a need to evaluate its potential on other type of astronomical data, such\nas from numerical simulations. GERLUMPH (the GPU-Enabled High Resolution\ncosmological MicroLensing parameter survey) represents an example of a data\nintensive project in theoretical astrophysics. In the next phase of processing,\nthe ~27 terabyte GERLUMPH dataset is set to grow by a factor of 100 -- well\nbeyond the current storage capabilities of the supercomputing facility on which\nit resides. In order to minimise bandwidth usage, file transfer time, and\nstorage space, this work evaluates several data compression techniques.\nSpecifically, we investigate off-the-shelf and custom lossless compression\nalgorithms as well as the lossy JPEG2000 compression format. Results of\nlossless compression algorithms on GERLUMPH data products show small\ncompression ratios (1.35:1 to 4.69:1 of input file size) varying with the\nnature of the input data. Our results suggest that JPEG2000 could be suitable\nfor other numerical datasets stored as gridded data or volumetric data. When\napproaching lossy data compression, one should keep in mind the intended\npurposes of the data to be compressed, and evaluate the effect of the loss on\nfuture analysis. In our case study, lossy compression and a high compression\nratio do not significantly compromise the intended use of the data for\nconstraining quasar source profiles from cosmological microlensing.\n", "  I present a currents algebra for the two-sites Bose-Hubbard model, generalize\nthe Heisenberg equation of motion to write the second time derivative of the\ncurrents operators and use it to get the quantum dynamics of the currents. For\ndifferent choices of the Hamiltonian parameters I get different currents\ndynamics and determine the period of the oscillations in function of the\nparameters.\n", "  A scalar model of glueball is considered. The model is based on two scalar\nfields approximation for SU(3) non-Abelian Lagrangian. The approach to\napproximation makes use of the assumption that 2 and 4-points Green's functions\nare described in terms of some two scalar fields. The model is described via\nnon-perturbative method due to value of coupling constant, which does not\npermit us using of Feynman diagrams and therefore of perturbative methods.\nAsymptotical behaviour of the scalar fields are obtained. Profiles of these\nfileds calculated for a range of values of a parameter of the problem is given.\nDetailed numerical investigation of corresponding equations describing this\nmodel is performed. The dependence of the glueball mass vs parameters of scalar\nfields is shown. Comparison of characteristics of glueball obtained in our\ntwo-scalar model and predictions of other models and experimental data for\nglueball is performed.\n", "  The trans-Planckian theory is a model that realizes concretely the Born\nreciprocity idea, which is the postulate of absolute equivalence between\ncoordinate $x$ and momenta $p$. This model is intrinsically global, and thus it\nis naturally implemented in a cosmological setting. Cosmology and Born\nreciprocity are made for each other. Inflation provides the essential mechanism\nto suppress the terms coming from the dual part of the action. The\ntrans-Planckian theory provides an explanation for the present acceleration of\nthe universe scale factor. This is possible just considering a simple model\nthat contains gravity, one gauge field plus one matter field (to be identified\nwith dark matter), together with the reciprocity principle.\n", "  Current microelectrodes designed to record chronic neural activity suffer\nfrom recording instabilities due to the modulus mismatch between the electrode\nmaterials and the brain. We sought to address this by microfabricating a novel\nflexible neural probe. Our probe was fabricated from parylene-C with a WTi\nmetal, using contact photolithography and reactive ion etching, with three\ndesign features to address this modulus mismatch: a sinusoidal shaft, a rounded\ntip and a polyimide anchoring ball. The anchor restricts movement of the\nelectrode recording sites and the shaft accommodates the brain motion. We\nsuccessfully patterned thick metal and parylene-C layers, with a reliable\ndevice release process leading to high functional yield. This novel reliably\nmicrofabricated probe can record stable neural activity for up to two years\nwithout delamination, surpassing the current state-of-the-art intracortical\nprobes. This challenges recent concerns that have been raised over the\nlong-term reliability of chronic implants when Parylene-C is used as an\ninsulator, for both research and human applications. The microfabrication and\ndesign considerations provided in this manuscript may aid in the future\ndevelopment of flexible devices for biomedical applications.\n", "  Quantum theory is based on a mathematical structure totally different from\nconventional arithmetic. Due to the symmetric nature of bosonic particles,\nannihilation or creation of single particles translates a quantum state\ndepending on how many bosons are already in the given quantum system. This\nproportionality results in a variety of non-classical features of quantum\nmechanics including the bosonic commutation relation. The annihilation and\ncreation operations have recently been implemented in photonic systems.\nHowever, this feature of quantum mechanics does not preclude the possibility of\nrealizing conventional arithmetic in quantum systems. We implement conventional\naddition and subtraction of single phonons for a trapped \\Yb ion in a harmonic\npotential. In order to realize such operations, we apply the transitionless\nadiabatic passage scheme on the anti-Jaynes-Cummings coupling between the\ninternal energy states and external motion states of the ion. By performing the\noperations on superpositions of Fock states, we realize the hybrid computation\nof classical arithmetic in quantum parallelism, and show that our operations\nare useful to engineer quantum states. Our single-phonon operations are nearly\ndeterministic and robust against parameter changes, enabling handy repetition\nof the operations independently from the initial state of the atomic motion. We\ndemonstrate the transform of a classical state to a nonclassical one of highly\nsub-Poissonian phonon statistics and a Gaussian state to a non-Gaussian state,\nby applying a sequence of the operations. The operations implemented here are\nthe Susskind-Glogower phase operators, whose non-commutativity is also\ndemonstrated.\n", "  As few real systems comprise indistinguishable units, diversity is a hallmark\nof nature. Diversity among interacting units shapes properties of collective\nbehavior such as synchronization and information transmission. However, the\nbenefits of diversity on information processing at the edge of a phase\ntransition, ordinarily assumed to emerge from identical elements, remain\nlargely unexplored. Analyzing a general model of excitable systems with\nheterogeneous excitability, we find that diversity can greatly enhance optimal\nperformance (by two orders of magnitude) when distinguishing incoming inputs.\nHeterogeneous systems possess a subset of specialized elements whose capability\ngreatly exceeds that of the nonspecialized elements. Nonetheless, the behavior\nof the whole network can outperform all subgroups. We also find that diversity\ncan yield multiple percolation, with performance optimized at tricriticality.\nOur results are robust in specific and more realistic neuronal systems\ncomprising a combination of excitatory and inhibitory units, and indicate that\ndiversity-induced amplification can be harnessed by neuronal systems for\nevaluating stimulus intensities.\n", "  Depending on the exact experimental conditions, the thermodynamic properties\nof physical systems can be related to one or more thermostatistical ensembles.\nHere, we survey the notion of thermodynamic temperature in different\nstatistical ensembles, focusing in particular on subtleties that arise when\nensembles become non-equivalent. The 'mother' of all ensembles, the\nmicrocanonical ensemble, uses entropy and internal energy (the most\nfundamental, dynamically conserved quantity) to derive temperature as a\nsecondary thermodynamic variable. Over the past century, some confusion has\nbeen caused by the fact that several competing microcanonical entropy\ndefinitions are used in the literature, most commonly the volume and surface\nentropies introduced by Gibbs. It can be proved, however, that only the volume\nentropy satisfies exactly the traditional form of the laws of thermodynamics\nfor a broad class of physical systems, including all standard classical\nHamiltonian systems, regardless of their size. This mathematically rigorous\nfact implies that negative 'absolute' temperatures and Carnot efficiencies $>1$\nare not achievable within a standard thermodynamical framework. As an important\noffspring of microcanonical thermostatistics, we shall briefly consider the\ncanonical ensemble and comment on the validity of the Boltzmann weight factor.\nWe conclude by addressing open mathematical problems that arise for systems\nwith discrete energy spectrum.\n", "  We present results from Monte Carlo calculations investigating the properties\nof the homogeneous, spin-balanced unitary Fermi gas in three dimensions. The\ntemperature is varied across the superfluid transition allowing us to determine\nthe temperature dependence of the chemical potential, the energy per particle\nand the contact density. Numerical artifacts due to finite volume and\ndiscretization are systematically studied, estimated, and reduced.\n", "  We consider the Potts model with $q$ colors on a sequence of weighted graphs\nwith adjacency matrices $A_n$, allowing for both positive and negative weights.\nUnder a mild regularity condition the mean-field prediction for the log\npartition function of the Potts model on a sequence of matrices $A_n$ is\nasymptotically correct, whenever $\\text{tr}(A_n^2)=o(n)$. In particular, our\nresults are applicable for the Ising and the Potts models on any sequence of\ngraphs with average degree going to $+\\infty$. Using this, we establish the\nuniversality of the limiting log partition function of the ferromagnetic Potts\nmodel for a sequence of asymptotically regular graphs, and that of the Ising\nmodel for bi-regular bipartite graphs in both ferromagnetic and\nanti-ferromagnetic domain. We also derive a large deviation principle for the\nempirical measure of the colors for the Potts model on asymptotically regular\ngraphs.\n", "  We use high resolution simulations of isolated dwarf galaxies to study the\nphysics of dark matter cusp-core transformations at the edge of galaxy\nformation: M200 = 10^7 - 10^9 Msun. We work at a resolution (~4 pc minimum cell\nsize; ~250 Msun per particle) at which the impact from individual supernovae\nexplosions can be resolved, becoming insensitive to even large changes in our\nnumerical 'sub-grid' parameters. We find that our dwarf galaxies give a\nremarkable match to the stellar light profile; star formation history;\nmetallicity distribution function; and star/gas kinematics of isolated dwarf\nirregular galaxies. Our key result is that dark matter cores of size comparable\nto the stellar half mass radius (r_1/2) always form if star formation proceeds\nfor long enough. Cores fully form in less than 4 Gyrs for the M200 = 10^8 Msun\nand 14 Gyrs for the 10^9 Msun dwarf. We provide a convenient two parameter\n'coreNFW' fitting function that captures this dark matter core growth as a\nfunction of star formation time and the projected stellar half mass radius.\n  Our results have several implications: (i) we make a strong prediction that\nif LCDM is correct, then 'pristine' dark matter cusps will be found either in\nsystems that have truncated star formation and/or at radii r > r_1/2; (ii)\ncomplete core formation lowers the projected velocity dispersion at r_1/2 by a\nfactor ~2, which is sufficient to fully explain the 'too big to fail problem';\nand (iii) cored dwarfs will be much more susceptible to tides, leading to a\ndramatic scouring of the subhalo mass function inside galaxies and groups.\n", "  Obtaining general relations between macroscopic properties of random\nassemblies, such as density, and the microscopic properties of their\nconstituent particles, such as shape, is a foundational challenge in the study\nof amorphous materials. By leveraging existing understanding of the random\npacking of spherical particles, we estimate the random packing density for all\nsufficiently spherical shapes. Our method uses the ensemble of random packing\nconfigurations of spheres as a reference point for a perturbative calculation,\nwhich we carry to linear order in the deformation. A fully analytic calculation\nshows that all sufficiently spherical shapes pack more densely than spheres.\nAdditionally, we use simulation data for spheres to calculate numerical\nestimates for nonspherical particles and compare these estimates to\nsimulations.\n", "  In the Relativistic Quantum Geometry (RQG) formalism recently introduced, was\nexplored the possibility that the variation of the tensor metric can be done in\na Weylian integrable manifold using a geometric displacement, from a Riemannian\nto a Weylian integrable manifold, described by the dynamics of an auxiliary\ngeometrical scalar field $\\theta$, in order that the Einstein tensor (and the\nEinstein equations) can be represented on a Weyl-like manifold. In this\nframework we study jointly the dynamics of electromagnetic fields produced by\nquantum complex vector fields, which describes charges without charges. We\ndemonstrate that complex fields act as a source of tetra-vector fields which\ndescribe an extended Maxwell dynamics.\n", "  In the present work, HfO2 thin film (100nm) has been deposited by sputtering\ntechnique and annealed at various temperatures ranging from 400 to 1000\\degree\n(in step of 200 \\degree) in O2 ambient for 10 min. The samples have been\ncharacterized using XRD, FTIR, EDAX, AFM and Laser Ellipsometer. The impact of\nannealing temperatures in O2 ambient on structural properties such as\ncrystallite size, phase, orientation, stress have been studied using XRD. The\nHf-O phonon peaks in the infrared absorption spectrum are detected at 512, 412\ncm^-1 . The stretching vibration modes at 720 cm^-1 and 748 cm^-1 correspond to\nHfO2. AFM data show mean grain size in the range of 38 nm to 67 nm. The film\nreveals variation in structural properties, which appears to be responsible for\nvariation in oxygen percentage, refractive index (1.96 to 2.01) at 632 nm\nwavelength and roughness (6.13nm to 16.40nm). Annealing temperature as well as\nambient condition has significant effects on stress, crystal size and thus the\narrangement of atoms. For good quality film, annealing temperature larger than\n600 \\degree is desired.\n", "  We consider a general enough set-up and obtain a refinement of the coupling\nbetween the Gaussian free field and random interlacements recently constructed\nby Titus Lupu in arXiv:1402.0298. We apply our results to level-set percolation\nof the Gaussian free field on a $(d+1)$-regular tree, when $d \\ge 2$, and\nderive bounds on the critical value $h_*$. In particular, we show that $0 < h_*\n< \\sqrt{2u_*}$, where $u_*$ denotes the critical level for the percolation of\nthe vacant set of random interlacements on a $(d+1)$-regular tree.\n", "  It was investigated recently, with the aim of testing the weak cosmic\ncensorship conjecture, whether an extremal Kerr black hole can be converted\ninto a naked singularity by interaction with a massless classical Dirac test\nfield, and it was found that this is possible. We generalize this result to\nelectrically and magnetically charged rotating extremal black holes (i.e.\nextremal dyonic Kerr-Newman black holes) and massive Dirac test fields,\nallowing magnetically or electrically uncharged or nonrotating black holes and\nthe massless Dirac field as special cases. We show that the possibility of the\nconversion is a direct consequence of the fact that the Einstein-Hilbert\nenergy-momentum tensor of the classical Dirac field does not satisfy the null\nenergy condition, and is therefore not in contradiction with the weak cosmic\ncensorship conjecture. We give a derivation of the absence of superradiance of\nthe Dirac field without making use of the complete separability of the Dirac\nequation in dyonic Kerr-Newman background, and we determine the range of\nsuperradiant frequencies of the scalar field. The range of frequencies of the\nDirac field that can be used to convert a black hole into a naked singularity\npartially coincides with the superradiant range of the scalar field. We apply\nhorizon-penetrating coordinates, as our arguments involve calculating\nquantities at the event horizon. We describe the separation of variables for\nthe Dirac equation in these coordinates, although we mostly avoid using it.\n", "  A bilayer graphene based electrostatically doped tunnel field-effect\ntransistor (BED-TFET) is proposed in this work. Unlike graphene nanoribbon\nTFETs in which the edge states deteriorate the OFF-state performance, BED-TFETs\noperate based on different bandgaps induced by vertical electric fields in the\nsource, channel, and drain regions without any chemical doping. The performance\nof the transistor is evaluated by self-consistent quantum transport\nsimulations. This device has several advantages: 1) ultra-low power (VDD=0.1V),\n2) high performance (ION/IOFF>104), 3) steep subthreshold swing (SS<10mv/dec),\nand 4) electrically configurable between N-TFET and P-TFET post fabrication.\nHere, the operation principle of the BED-TFET and its performance sensitivity\nto the device design parameters are studied.\n", "  Results of a search for new phenomena in events with at least three photons\nare reported. Data from proton--proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of\n8 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 20.3 fb$^{-1}$, were\ncollected with the ATLAS detector at the LHC. The observed data are well\ndescribed by the Standard Model. Limits at the 95% confidence level on new\nphenomena are presented based on the rate of events in an inclusive signal\nregion and a restricted signal region targeting the rare decay $Z\\to 3\\gamma$,\nas well as di-photon and tri-photon resonance searches. For a Standard Model\nHiggs boson decaying to four photons via a pair of intermediate pseudoscalar\nparticles ($a$), limits are found to be $\\sigma \\times {\\text {BR}}(h\n\\rightarrow aa) \\times {\\text {BR}}(a \\rightarrow \\gamma \\gamma)^{2} < 10^{-3}\n\\sigma_{\\text{SM}}$ for 10 GeV $< m_{a} <$ 62 GeV. Limits are also presented\nfor Higgs boson-like scalars ($H$) for $m_{H} > $ 125 GeV, and for a $Z'$\ndecaying to three photons via $Z' \\rightarrow a+\\gamma \\rightarrow 3\\gamma$.\nAdditionally, the observed limit on the branching ratio of the $Z$ boson decay\nto three photons is found to be BR$(Z \\rightarrow 3\\gamma) < 2.2 \\times\n10^{-6}$, a result five times stronger than the previous result from LEP.\n", "  We prove stability for arbitrarily long times of the zero solution for the\nso-called $\\beta$-plane equation, which describes the motion of a\ntwo-dimensional inviscid, ideal fluid under the influence of the Coriolis\neffect. The Coriolis force introduces a linear dispersive operator into the 2d\nincompressible Euler equations, thus making this problem amenable to an\nanalysis from the point of view of nonlinear dispersive equations. The\ndispersive operator, $L_1:=\\frac{\\partial_1}{|\\nabla|^2}$, exhibits good decay,\nbut has numerous unfavorable properties, chief among which are its anisotropy\nand its behavior at small frequencies.\n", "  We review recent statistical mechanical approaches to multimode laser theory.\nThe theory has proved very effective to describe standard lasers. We refer of\nthe mean field theory for passive mode locking and developments based on Monte\nCarlo simulations and cavity method to study the role of the frequency matching\ncondition. The status for a complete theory of multimode lasing in open and\ndisordered cavities is discussed and the derivation of the general statistical\nmodels in this framework is presented. When light is propagating in a\ndisordered medium, the system can be analyzed via the replica method. For high\ndegrees of disorder and nonlinearity, a glassy behavior is expected at the\nlasing threshold, providing a suggestive link between glasses and photonics. We\ndescribe in details the results for the general Hamiltonian model in mean field\napproximation and mention an available test for replica symmetry breaking from\nintensity spectra measurements. Finally, we summary some perspectives still\nopened for such approaches.\n", "  We perform an extensive numerical study of the disordered Poland-Scheraga\n(PS) model for DNA denaturation in which self-avoidance is completely taken\ninto account. In complement to our previous work, we focus here on the finite\nsize scaling in terms of pseudo-critical temperatures. We find notably that the\nmean value and the fluctuations of the pseudo-$T_c$ scale with the same\nexponent, the correlation length exponent $\\nu_r$ (for which we provide the\nrefined evaluation $\\nu_r=2.9 \\pm 0.4$). This result (coherent with the typical\npicture that describes random ferromagnets, when disorder is relevant) is at\nvariance with numerical results reported in the literature for the PS model\nwith self-avoidance, leading to an alternative scenario with a pseudo first\norder transition. We moreover introduce a crossover chain length $N^*$, which\nwe evaluate, appropriate for characterizing the approach to the asymptotic\nregime in this model. Essentially, below $N^*$, the behaviour of the model in\nour study could also agree with such alternative scenario. Based on an\napproximate prediction of the dependence of $N^*$ on the parameters of the\nmodel, we show that following the choice of such parameters it could be not\npossible to reach the asymptotic regime in practice. In such context it becomes\nthen possible to reconcile the apparently contradictory numerical studies.\n", "  We study charged scalar perturbations in the background of a regular magnetic\nblack hole. In this case, the charged scalar perturbation does not result in\nsuperradiance. By using careful time-domain analysis, we show that the charge\nof scalar field can change the real part of quasinormal frequency, but has\nlittle impact on the imaginary part of quasinormal frequency and the behavior\nof the late-time tail. Therefore, the regular magnetic black hole may be stable\nunder the perturbations of charged scalar field at the linear level.\n", "  In this paper we present a general framework for solving the stationary\nnonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation (NLSE) on a network of one-dimensional wires\nmodelled by a metric graph with suitable matching conditions at the vertices. A\nformal solution is given that expresses the wave function and its derivative at\none end of an edge (wire) nonlinearly in terms of the values at the other end.\nFor the cubic NLSE this nonlinear transfer operation can be expressed\nexplicitly in terms of Jacobi elliptic functions. Its application reduces the\nproblem of solving the corresponding set of coupled ordinary nonlinear\ndifferential equations to a finite set of nonlinear algebraic equations. For\nsufficiently small amplitudes we use canonical perturbation theory which makes\nit possible to extract the leading nonlinear corrections over large distances.\n", "  We generate pulsed, two mode squeezed states in a single spatio-temporal mode\nwith mean photon numbers up to 20. We directly measure\nphoton-number-correlations between the two modes with transition edge sensors\nup to 80 photons per mode. This corresponds roughly to a state-dimensionality\nof 6400. We achieve detection efficiencies of 64% in the technologically\ncrucial telecom regime and demonstrate the high quality of our measurements by\nheralded nonclassical distributions up to 50 photons per pulse and calculated\ncorrelation functions up to 40th order.\n", "  A new universality in optimization of trade-off between power and efficiency\nfor low-dissipation Carnot cycles is presented. It is shown that any trade-off\nmeasure expressible in terms of efficiency and the ratio of power to its\nmaximum value can be optimized independently of most details of the dynamics\nand of the coupling to thermal reservoirs. The result is demonstrated on two\nspecific trade-off measures. The first one is designed for finding optimal\nefficiency for a given output power and clearly reveals diseconomy of engines\nworking at maximum power. As the second example we derive universal lower and\nupper bounds on the efficiency at maximum trade-off given by the product of\npower and efficiency. The results are illustrated on a model of a\ndiffusion-based heat engine. Such engines operate in the low-dissipation regime\ngiven that the used driving minimizes the work dissipated during the isothermal\nbranches. The peculiarities of the corresponding optimization procedure are\nreviewed and thoroughly discussed.\n", "  We address the question of why strongly correlated d-wave superconductors,\nsuch as the cuprates, prove to be surprisingly robust against the introduction\nof non-magnetic impurities. We show that, very generally, both the\npair-breaking and the normal state transport scattering rates are significantly\nsuppressed by strong correlations effects arising in the proximity to a Mott\ninsulating state. We also show that the correlation-renormalized scattering\namplitude is generically enhanced in the forward direction, an effect which was\npreviously often ascribed to the specific scattering by charged impurities\noutside the copper-oxide planes.\n", "  In this article, we have studied the cosmological and particle physics\nconstraints on dark matter relic abundance from effective field theory of\ninflation using tensor-to-scalar ratio ($r$), in case of Randall-Sundrum single\nmembrane (RSII) paradigm. Using semi-analytical approach we establish a direct\nconnection between the dark matter relic abundance ($\\Omega_{DM}h^2$) and\nprimordial gravity waves ($r$), which establishes a precise connection between\ninflation and generation of dark matter within the framework of effective field\ntheory in RSII membrane. Further assuming the UV completeness of the effective\nfield theory perfectly holds good in the prescribed framework, we have\nexplicitly shown that the membrane tension, $\\sigma$, bulk mass scale $M_5$,\nand cosmological constant $\\tilde{\\Lambda}_{5}$, in RSII membrane plays the\nmost significant role to establish the connection between dark matter and\ninflation, using which we have studied the features of various mediator mass\nscale suppressed effective field theory \"relevant operators\" induced from the\nlocalized $s$, $t$ and $u$ channel interactions. Taking a completely model\nindependent approach, we have studied an exhaustive list of tree-level Feynman\ndiagrams for dark matter annihilation within the prescribed setup and to check\nthe consistency of the obtained results, further we apply the constraints as\nobtained from recently observed Planck 2015 data and Planck+BICEP2+Keck Array\njoint datasets. Using all of these derived results we have shown that to\nsatisfy the bound on, $\\Omega_{DM}h^2=0.1187\\pm 0.0017$, as from Planck 2015\ndata, it is possible to put further stringent constraint on $r$ within,\n$0.01\\leq r\\leq 0.12$, for thermally averaged annihilation cross-section of\ndark matter, $\\langle \\sigma v\\rangle\\approx {\\cal O}(10^{-28}-10^{-27}){\\rm\ncm^3 /s}$, which are very useful to constrain various membrane inflationary\nmodels.\n", "  We show that the well-known problem of frame dependence and violation of\nlocal Lorentz invariance in the usual formulation of $f(T)$ gravity is a\nconsequence of neglecting the role of spin connection. We re-formulate $f(T)$\ngravity starting, instead of the \"pure-tetrad\" teleparallel gravity, from the\ncovariant teleparallel gravity, using both the tetrad and the spin connection\nas dynamical variables, resulting in the fully covariant, consistent, and\nframe-independent, version of $f(T)$ gravity, which does not suffer from the\nnotorious problems of the usual, pure-tetrad, $f(T)$ theory. We present the\nmethod to extract solutions for the most physically important cases, such as\nthe Minkowski, the FRW and the spherically-symmetric ones. We show that in the\ncovariant $f(T)$ gravity we are allowed to use an arbitrary tetrad in an\narbitrary coordinate system along with the corresponding spin connection,\nresulting always to the same physically relevant field equations.\n", "  The ground-state (GS) phase diagram of the frustrated spin-$s$\n$J_{1}$--$J_{2}$--$J_{3}$ Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the honeycomb lattice\nis studied using the coupled cluster method, for spin quantum numbers\n$s=1,\\,\\frac{3}{2},\\,2\\,,\\frac{5}{2}$. We study the case $J_{3}=J_{2}=\\kappa\nJ_{1}$, in the range $0 \\leq \\kappa \\leq 1$, which includes the point of\nmaximum classical ($s \\to \\infty$) frustration, viz., the classical critical\npoint at $\\kappa_{{\\rm cl}}=\\frac{1}{2}$, separating the N\\'{e}el phase for\n$\\kappa < \\kappa_{{\\rm cl}}$ and the collinear striped AFM phase for $\\kappa >\n\\kappa_{{\\rm cl}}$. Results are presented for the GS energy, magnetic order\nparameter and plaquette valence-bond crystal (PVBC) susceptibility. For all\nspins $s \\geq \\frac{3}{2}$ we find a quantum phase diagram very similar to the\nclassical one, with a direct first-order transition between the two collinear\nAFM states at a value $\\kappa_{c}(s)$ which is slightly greater than\n$\\kappa_{{\\rm cl}}$ [e.g., $\\kappa_{c}(\\frac{3}{2}) \\approx 0.53(1)$] and which\napproaches it monotonically as $s \\to \\infty$. By contrast, for the case $s=1$\nthe transition is split into two such that the stable GS phases are ones with\nN\\'{e}el AFM order for $\\kappa < \\kappa_{c_{1}} = 0.485(5)$ and with striped\nAFM order for $\\kappa > \\kappa_{c_{2}} = 0.528(5)$, just as in the case\n$s=\\frac{1}{2}$ (for which $\\kappa_{c_{1}} \\approx 0.47$ and $\\kappa_{c_{2}}\n\\approx 0.60$). For both the $s=\\frac{1}{2}$ and $s=1$ models the transition at\n$\\kappa_{c_{2}}$ appears to be of first-order type, while that at\n$\\kappa_{c_{1}}$ appears to be continuous. However, whereas in the\n$s=\\frac{1}{2}$ case the intermediate phase appears to have PVBC order over the\nentire range $\\kappa_{c_{1}} < \\kappa < \\kappa_{c_{2}}$, in the $s=1$ case PVBC\nordering either exists only over a very small part of the region or, more\nlikely, is absent everywhere.\n", "  We theoretically investigate the relaxation dynamics of a nearly-flat binary\nlipid bilayer membrane by taking into account the membrane tension,\nhydrodynamics of the surrounding fluid, inter-monolayer friction and mutual\ndiffusion in each monolayer. We find that two relaxation modes associated with\nthe mutual diffusion appear in addition to the three previously discussed\nrelaxation modes reflecting the bending and compression of the membrane.\nBecause of the symmetry, only one of the two diffusive mode is coupled to the\nbending mode. The two diffusive modes are much slower than the bending and\ncompression modes in the entire realistic wave number range. This means that\nthe long time relaxation behavior is dominated by the mutual diffusion in\nbinary membranes. The two diffusive modes become even slower in the vicinity of\nthe unstable region towards phase separation, while the other modes are almost\nunchanged. In short time scales, on the other hand, the lipid composition\nheterogeneity induces in-plane compression and bending of the bilayer.\n", "  In one dimension one can dissect a scattering potential $ v(x) $ into pieces\n$ v_i(x) $ and use the notion of the transfer matrix to determine the\nscattering content of $ v(x) $ from that of $ v_i(x) $. This observation has\nnumerous practical applications in different areas of physics. The problem of\nfinding an analogous procedure in dimensions larger than one has been an\nimportant open problem for decades. We give a complete solution for this\nproblem and discuss some of its applications. In particular we derive an exact\nexpression for the scattering amplitude of the delta-function potential in two\nand three dimensions and a potential describing a slab laser with a surface\nline defect. We show that the presence of the defect makes the slab begin\nlasing for arbitrarily small gain coefficients.\n", "  We present a current algebra for a generalized two-site Bose-Hubbard model\nand use it to get the quantum dynamics of the currents. For different choices\nof the Hamiltonian parameters we get different currents dynamics. We generalize\nthe Heisenberg equation of motion to write the n-th time derivative of any\noperator.\n", "  Vector-like quarks, usually dubbed top partners, are a common presence in\ncomposite Higgs models. Being composite objects, their mass is expected to be\nof the order of their inverse size, that is the condensation scale of the new\nstrong interactions. Light top partners, while not being a generic prediction,\nare however often considered in phenomenological models. We suggest that their\nlightness may be due to the matching of global 't Hooft anomalies of the\nunderlying theory. We check this mechanism in explicit models showing that, in\none case, composite fermions with the quantum numbers of the top quark obtain a\nmass which is controlled by a soft breaking term and can be made parametrically\nsmall.\n", "  Hydrogen-rich compounds are extensively explored as candidates for a\nhigh-temperature superconductors. Currently, the measured critical temperature\nof $203$ K in hydrogen sulfide (H$_3$S) is among the highest over all-known\nsuperconductors. In present paper, using the strong-coupling Eliashberg theory\nof superconductivity, we compared in detail the thermodynamic properties of two\nsamples containing different hydrogen isotopes H$_3$S and D$_3$S at $150$ GPa.\nOur research indicates that it is possible to reproduce the measured values of\ncritical temperature $203$ K and $147$ K for H$_3$S and D$_3$S by using a\nCoulomb pseudopotential of $0.123$ and $0.131$, respectively. However, we also\ndiscuss a scenario in which the isotope effect is independent of pressure and\nthe Coulomb pseudopotential for D$_3$S is smaller than for H$_3$S. For both\nscenarios, the energy gap, specific heat, thermodynamic critical field and\nrelated dimensionless ratios are calculated and compared with other\nconventional superconductors. We shown that the existence of the\nstrong-coupling and retardation effects in the systems analysed result in\nsignificant differences between values obtained within the framework of the\nEliashberg formalism and the prediction of the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer\ntheory.\n", "  We theoretically reveal the possibility of specular Andreev reflection in a\nthin film topological insulator normal-superconductor (N/S) junction in the\npresence of a gate electric field. The probability of specular Andreev\nreflection increases with the electric field, and electron-hole conversion with\nunit efficiency happens in a wide experimentally accessible range of the\nelectric field. We show that perfect specular Andreev reflection can occur for\nall angles of incidence with a particular excitation energy value. In addition,\nwe find that the thermal conductance of the structure displays exponential\ndependence on the temperature. Our results reveal the potential of the proposed\ntopological insulator thin-film-based N/S structure for the realization of\nintraband specular Andreev reflection.\n", "  Electromagnetic stimulation of energetic materials provides a noninvasive and\nnondestructive tool for detecting and identifying explosives. We combine\nstructural information based on X-ray computed tomography, experimental\ndielectric data, and electromagnetic full-wave simulations, to study microscale\nelectromagnetic heating of realistic three-dimensional heterogeneous\nexplosives. We analyze the formation of electromagnetic hot spots and thermal\ngradients in the explosive-binder meso-structures, and compare the heating rate\nfor various binder systems.\n", "  Measuring the state of a quantum system is a fundamental process in quantum\nmechanics and plays an essential role in quantum information and quantum\ntechnologies. One method to measure a quantum observable is to sort the system\nin different spatial modes according to the measured value, followed by\nsingle-particle detectors on each mode. Examples of quantum sorters are\npolarizing beam-splitters (PBS) -- which direct photons according to their\npolarization -- and Stern-Gerlach devices. Here we propose a general scheme to\nsort a quantum system according to the value of any $d$-dimensional degree of\nfreedom, such as spin, orbital angular momentum (OAM), wavelength etc. Our\nscheme is universal, works at the single-particle level and has a theoretical\nefficiency of 100\\%. As an application we design an efficient OAM sorter\nconsisting of a single multi-path interferometer which is suitable for a\nphotonic chip implementation.\n", "  We describe our modelling of the radiatively cooling shocks and their thin\nshells with various numerical tools in different physical and calculational\nsetups. We inspect structure of the dense shell, its formation and evolution,\npointing out physical and numerical factors that sustain its shape and also may\nlead to instabilities. We have found that under certain physical conditions,\nthe circular shaped shells show a strong bending instability and successive\nfragmentation on Cartesian grids soon after their formation, while remain\nalmost unperturbed when simulated on polar meshes. We explain this by physical\nRayleigh--Taylor like instabilities triggered by corrugation of the dense shell\nsurfaces by numerical noise. Conditions for these instabilities follow from\nboth the shell structure itself and from episodes of transient acceleration\nduring re-establishing of dynamical pressure balance after sudden radiative\ncooling onset. They are also easily excited by physical perturbations of the\nambient medium. The widely mentioned Non-linear Thin Shell Instability, in\ncontrast, in tests with physical perturbations is shown to have only limited\nchances to develop in real radiative shocks, as it seems to require a special\nspatial arrangement of fluctuations to be excited efficiently. The described\nphenomena also set new requirements on further simulations of the radiatively\ncooling shocks in order to be physically correct and free of numerical\nartefacts.\n", "  An investigation of magnetic fields generated in an expanding bubble of\nplasma with misaligned temperature and density gradients (driving the Biermann\nbattery mechanism) is performed. With gradient scales $L$, large-scale magnetic\nfields are generated by the Biermann battery mechanism with plasma $\\beta \\sim\n1$, as long as $L$ is comparable to the ion inertial length $d_i$. For larger\nsystem sizes, $L/d_e > 100$ (where $d_e$ is the electron inertial length), the\nWeibel instability generates magnetic fields of similar magnitude but with\nwavenumber $k d_e \\sim 0.2$. In both cases, the growth and saturation of these\nfields have a weak dependence on mass ratio $m_i/m_e$, indicating electron\nmediated physics. A scan in system size is performed at $m_i/m_e = 2000$,\nshowing agreement with previous results with $m_i/m_e = 25$. In addition, the\ninstability found at large system sizes is quantitatively demonstrated to be\nthe Weibel instability. Furthermore, magnetic and electric energy spectra at\nscales below the electron Larmor radius are found to exhibit power law behavior\nwith spectral indices $-16/3$ and $-7/3$, respectively.\n", "  The virial theorem for a system of interacting electrons in a crystal, which\nis described within the framework of the tight-binding model, is derived. We\nshow that, in particular case of interacting massless electrons in graphene and\nother Dirac materials, the conventional virial theorem is violated. Starting\nfrom the tight-binding model, we derive the generalized virial theorem for\nDirac electron systems, which contains an additional term associated with a\nmomentum cutoff at the bottom of the energy band. Additionally, we derive the\ngeneralized virial theorem within the Dirac model using the minimization of the\nvariational energy. The obtained theorem is illustrated by many-body\ncalculations of the ground state energy of an electron gas in graphene carried\nout in Hartree-Fock and self-consistent random-phase approximations.\nExperimental verification of the theorem in the case of graphene is discussed.\n", "  We describe the design, construction and operation of a versatile\ndual-species Zeeman slower for both Cs and Yb, which is easily adaptable for\nuse with other alkali metals and alkaline earths. With the aid of analytic\nmodels and numerical simulation of decelerator action, we highlight several\nreal-world problems affecting the performance of a slower and discuss effective\nsolutions. To capture Yb into a magneto-optical trap (MOT), we use the broad\n$^1S_0$ to $^1P_1$ transition at 399 nm for the slower and the narrow $^1S_0$\nto $^3P_1$ intercombination line at 556 nm for the MOT. The Cs MOT and slower\nboth use the D2 line ($6^2S_{1/2}$ to $6^2P_{3/2}$) at 852 nm. We demonstrate\nthat within a few seconds the Zeeman slower loads more than $10^9$ Yb atoms and\n$10^8$ Cs atoms into their respective MOTs. These are ideal starting numbers\nfor further experiments on ultracold mixtures and molecules.\n", "  The study of heat transport in low-dimensional oscillator lattices presents a\nformidable challenge. Theoretical efforts have been made trying to reveal the\nunderlying mechanism of diversified heat transport behaviors. In lack of a\nunified rigorous treatment, approximate theories often may embody controversial\npredictions. It is therefore of ultimate importance that one can rely on\nnumerical simulations in the investigation of heat transfer processes in\nlow-dimensional lattices. The simulation of heat transport using the\nnon-equilibrium heat bath method and the Green-Kubo method will be introduced.\nIt is found that one-dimensional (1D), two-dimensional (2D) and\nthree-dimensional (3D) momentum-conserving nonlinear lattices display power-law\ndivergent, logarithmic divergent and constant thermal conductivities,\nrespectively. Next, a novel diffusion method is also introduced. The heat\ndiffusion theory connects the energy diffusion and heat conduction in a\nstraightforward manner. This enables one to use the diffusion method to\ninvestigate the objective of heat transport. In addition, it contains\nfundamental information about the heat transport process which cannot readily\nbe gathered otherwise.\n", "  The geodesic deviation equation has been investigated in the framework of\n$f(T,\\mathcal{T})$ gravity, where $T$ denotes the torsion and $\\mathcal{T}$ is\nthe trace of the energy-momentum tensor, respectively. The FRW metric is\nassumed and the geodesic deviation equation has been established following the\nGeneral Relativity approach in the first hand and secondly, by a direct method\nusing the modified Friedmann equations. Via fundamental observers and null\nvector fields with FRW background, we have generalized the Raychaudhuri\nequation and the Mattig relation in $f(T,\\mathcal{T})$ gravity. Furthermore, we\nhave numerically solved the geodesic deviation equation for null vector fields\nby considering a particular form of $f(T,\\mathcal{T})$ which induces\ninteresting results susceptible to be tested with observational data.\n", "  Cooling molecules in the gas phase is important for precision spectroscopy,\ncold molecule physics, and physical chemistry. Measurements of conformational\nrelaxation cross sections shed important light on potential energy surfaces and\nenergy flow within a molecule. However, gas-phase conformational cooling has\nnot been previously observed directly. In this work, we directly observe\nconformational dynamics of 1,2-propanediol in cold (6K) collisions with atomic\nhelium using microwave spectroscopy and buffer-gas cooling. Precise knowledge\nand control of the collisional environment in the buffer-gas allows us to\nmeasure the absolute collision cross-section for conformational relaxation.\nSeveral conformers of 1,2-propanediol are investigated and found to have\nrelaxation cross-sections with He ranging from\n$\\sigma=4.7(3.0)\\times10^{-18}\\:\\mathrm{cm}^{2}$ to\n$\\sigma>5\\times10^{-16}\\:\\mathrm{cm}^{2}$. Our method is applicable to a broad\nclass of molecules and could be used to provide information about the potential\nenergy surfaces of previously uninvestigated molecules.\n", "  We report on the temporal lasing dynamics of high quality ZnO nanowires using\ntime-resolved micro-photoluminescence technique. The temperature dependence of\nthe lasing characteristics and of the corresponding decay constants demonstrate\nthe formation of an electron-hole plasma to be the underlying gain mechanism in\nthe considered temperature range from 10 K to 300 K. We found that the\ntemperature dependent emission onset-time ($t_{\\text{on}}$) strongly depends on\nthe excitation power and becomes smallest in the lasing regime, with values\nbelow 5 ps. Furthermore, the observed red shift of the dominating lasing modes\nin time is qualitatively discussed in terms of the carrier density induced\nchange of the refractive index dispersion after the excitation laser pulse.\nThis theory is supported by extending an existing model for the calculation of\nthe carrier density dependent complex refractive index for different\ntemperatures. This model coincides with the experimental observations and\nreliably describes the evolution of the refractive index after the excitation\nlaser pulse.\n", "  On the basis of experimental data and mathematical equations in the\nliterature, we remodel the ionic dynamics of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) as an\neigensystem formulation, which is valid for investigating finite variations of\nvariables from the equilibrium like in common experimental operations. This\nalgorithm provides an alternate viewpoint from frequency-domain analysis and\nenables one to probe functionalities of SMC's rhythm by means of a\nresonance-related mechanism. Numerical results show three types of calcium\noscillations of SMCs in mesenteric arterioles: spontaneous calcium oscillation,\nagonist-dependent calcium oscillation, and agonist-dependent calcium spike. For\nsimple single and double SMCs, we demonstrate properties of synchronization\namong complex signals related to calcium oscillations, and show different\ncorrelation relations between calcium and voltage signals for various\nsynchronization and resonance conditions. For practical cell clusters, our\nanalyses indicate that the rhythm of SMCs could (1) benefit enhancements of\nsignal communications among remote cells, (2) respond to a significant calcium\npeaking against transient stimulations for triggering globally-oscillating\nmodes, and (3) characterize the globally-oscillating modes via frog-leap\n(non-molecular-diffusion) calcium waves across inhomogeneous SMCs.\n", "  Anyons, quasiparticles living in two-dimensional spaces with exotic exchange\nstatistics, can serve as the fundamental units for fault-tolerant quantum\ncomputation. However, experimentally demonstrating anyonic statistics is a\nchallenge due to the technical limitations of current experimental platforms.\nHere, we take a state perpetration approach to mimic anyons in the Kitaev\nlattice model using a 7-qubit nuclear magnetic resonance quantum simulator.\nAnyons are created by dynamically preparing the ground and excited states of\nthe 7-qubit Kitaev lattice model, and are subsequently braided along two\ndistinct, but topologically equivalent, paths. We observe that the phase\nacquired by the anyons is independent of the path, and coincides with the ideal\ntheoretical predictions when decoherence and implementation errors are taken\ninto account. As the first demonstration of the topological path independence\nof anyons, our experiment helps to study and exploit the anyonic properties\ntowards the goal of building a topological quantum computer.\n", "  We solve the Balitsky-Kovchegov evolution equation at next-to-leading order\naccuracy including a resummation of large single and double transverse momentum\nlogarithms to all orders. We numerically determine an optimal value for the\nconstant under the large transverse momentum logarithm that enables including a\nmaximal amount of the full NLO result in the resummation. When this value is\nused the contribution from the $\\alpha_s^2$ terms without large logarithms is\nfound to be small at large saturation scales and at small dipoles. Close to\ninitial conditions relevant for phenomenological applications these fixed order\ncorrections are shown to be numerically important.\n", "  Spin-Cherenkov effect enables strong excitations of spin waves (SWs) with\nnonlinear wave dispersions. The Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) results\nin anisotropy and nonreciprocity of SWs propagation. In this work, we study the\neffect of the interfacial DMI on SW Cherenkov excitations in permalloy\nthin-film strips within the framework of micromagnetism. By performing\nmicromagnetic simulations, it is shown that coherent SWs are excited when the\nvelocity of a moving magnetic source exceeds the propagation velocity of the\nSWs. Moreover, the threshold velocity of the moving magnetic source with finite\nDMI can be reduced compared to the case of zero DMI. It thereby provides a\npromising route towards efficient SW generation and propagation, with potential\napplications in spintronic and magnonic devices.\n", "  Starting with the F/G supercoset model corresponding to the AdS_n x S^n\nsuperstring one can define the lambda-model of arXiv:1409.1538 either as a\ndeformation of the F/F gauged WZW model or as an integrable one-parameter\ngeneralization of the non-abelian T-dual of the AdS_n x S^n superstring sigma\nmodel with respect to the whole supergroup F. Here we consider the case of n=2\nand find the explicit form of the 4d target space background for the\nlambda-model for the PSU(1,1|2)/[SO(1,1) x SO(2)] supercoset. We show that this\nbackground represents a solution of type IIB 10d supergravity compactified on a\n6-torus with only metric, dilaton Phi and the RR 5-form (represented by a\n2-form F in 4d) being non-trivial. This implies that the lambda-model is Weyl\ninvariant at the quantum level and thus defines a consistent superstring sigma\nmodel. The supergravity solution we find is different from the one in\narXiv:1410.1886 which should correspond to a version of the lambda-model where\nonly the bosonic subgroup of F is gauged. Still, the two solutions have\nequivalent scaling limit of arXiv:1504.07213 leading to the isometric\nbackground for the metric and e^Phi F which is related to the eta-deformed\nAdS_2 x S^2 sigma model of arXiv:1309.5850. Similar results are expected in the\nAdS_3 x S^3 and AdS_5 x S^5 cases.\n", "  Performing a gauge transformation of a simple identity-like solution of\nsuperstring field theory, we construct a one-parameter family of solutions, and\nby evaluating the energy associated to this family, we show that for most of\nthe values of the parameter the solution represents the tachyon vacuum, except\nfor two isolated singular points where the solution becomes the perturbative\nvacuum and the half brane solution.\n", "  In this work we propose a new route to describe topological excitations in\nmagnetic systems through a single real scalar field. We show here that\nspherically symmetric structures in two spatial dimensions, which map helical\nexcitations in magnetic materials, admit this formulation and can be used to\nmodel skyrmion-like structures in magnetic materials.\n", "  We have spectroscopically determined the band offsets at epitaxial interfaces\nof BaSnO3 with SrTiO3(001) and LaAlO3(001). The conduction band minimum is\nlower in electron energy in the BaSnO3 than in the SrTiO3 and LaAlO3 by 0.6 +/-\n0.1 eV and 3.7 +/- 0.1 eV, respectively. Thus, electrons generated in the\nSrTiO3 and LaAlO3 and transferred to the BaSnO3 by modulation and polarization\ndoping, respectively, are expected to drift under the influence of an electric\nfield without undergoing impurity scattering and the associated loss of\nmobility. This result bodes well for the realization of oxide-based,\nhigh-mobility, two-dimensional electron systems that can operate at ambient\ntemperature.\n", "  For observers in curved spacetimes, elements of the dual space of the set of\nlinearized Poincar\\'e transformations from an observer's tangent space to\nitself can be naturally interpreted as local linear and angular momenta. We\npresent an operational procedure by which observers can measure such quantities\nusing only information about the spacetime curvature at their location. When\napplied by observers near spacelike or null infinity in stationary, vacuum,\nasymptotically flat spacetimes, there is a sense in which the procedure yields\nthe well-defined linear and angular momenta of the spacetime.\n  We also describe a general method by which observers can transport local\nlinear and angular momenta from one point to another, which improves previous\nprescriptions. This transport is not path independent in general, but becomes\npath independent for the measured momenta in the same limiting regime. The\ntransport prescription is defined in terms of differential equations, but it\ncan also be interpreted as parallel transport in a particular direct-sum vector\nbundle. Using the curvature of the connection on this bundle, we compute and\ndiscuss the holonomy of the transport law. We anticipate that these measurement\nand transport definitions may ultimately prove useful for clarifying the\nphysical interpretation of the Bondi-Metzner-Sachs charges of asymptotically\nflat spacetimes.\n", "  The conduction electrons in graphene promise new opportunities to access the\nregion of strong many-body electron-electron correlations. Extremely high\nquality, atomically flat two-dimensional electron sheets and\nquasi-one-dimensional electron nanoribbons with tuneable band gaps that can be\nswitched on by gates, should exhibit new many-body phenomena that have long\nbeen predicted for the regions of phase space where the average Coulomb\nrepulsions between electrons dominate over their Fermi energies. In electron\nnanoribbons a few nanometres wide etched in monolayers of graphene, the quantum\nsize effects and the van Hove singularities in their density of states further\nact to enhance electron correlations. For graphene multilayers or nanoribbons\nin a double unit electron-hole geometry, it is possible for the many-body\nelectron-hole correlations to be made strong enough to stabilise\nhigh-temperature electron-hole superfluidity.\n", "  We present a way of measuring with high precision the anharmonicity of a\nquantum oscillator coupled to an optical field via radiation pressure. Our\nprotocol uses a sequence of pulsed interactions to perform a loop in the phase\nspace of the mechanical oscillator, which is prepared in a thermal state. We\nshow how the optical field acquires a phase depending on the anharmonicity.\nRemarkably, one only needs small initial cooling of the mechanical motion to\nprobe even small anharmonicities. Finally, by applying tools from quantum\nestimation theory, we calculate the ultimate bound on the estimation precision\nposed by quantum mechanics and compare it with the precision obtainable with\nfeasible measurements such as homodyne and heterodyne detection on the cavity\nfield. In particular we demonstrate that homodyne detection is nearly optimal\nin the limit of a large number of photons of the field and we discuss the\nestimation precision of small anharmonicities in terms of its signal-to-noise\nratio.\n", "  The standard boundary state of a topological insulator in 3+1 dimensions has\ngapless charged fermions. We present model systems that reproduce this standard\ngapless boundary state in one phase, but also have gapped phases with\ntopological order. Our models are weakly coupled and all the dynamics is\nexplicit. We rederive some known boundary states of topological insulators and\nconstruct new ones. Consistency with the standard spin/charge relation of\ncondensed matter physics places a nontrivial constraint on models.\n", "  In the first part we study critical points of random polynomials. We choose\ntwo deterministic sequences of complex numbers,whose empirical measures\nconverge to the same probability measure in complex plane. We make a sequence\nof polynomials whose zeros are chosen from either of sequences at random. We\nshow that the limiting empirical measure of zeros and critical points agree for\nthese polynomials. As a consequence we show that when we randomly perturb the\nzeros of a deterministic sequence of polynomials, the limiting empirical\nmeasures of zeros and critical points agree. This result can be interpreted as\nan extension of earlier results where randomness is reduced. Pemantle and Rivin\ninitiated the study of critical points of random polynomials. Kabluchko proved\nthe result considering the zeros to be i.i.d. random variables.\n  In the second part we deal with the spectrum of products of Ginibre matrices.\nExact eigenvalue density is known for a very few matrix ensembles. For the\nknown ones they often lead to determinantal point process. Let\n$X_1,X_2,...,X_k$ be i.i.d matrices of size $n \\times n$ whose entries are\nindependent complex Gaussian random variables. We derive the eigenvalue density\nfor matrices of the form $Y_1.Y_2....Y_n$, where each $Y_i = X_i$ or\n$X_i^{-1}$. We show that the eigenvalues form a determinantal point process.\nThe case where $k=2$, $Y_1=X_1,Y_2=X_2^{-1}$ was derived earlier by Krishnapur.\nThe case where $Y_i =X_i$ for all $i=1,2,...,n$, was derived by Akemann and\nBurda. These two known cases can be obtained as special cases of our result.\n", "  It is well known that one cannot apply a conformal transformation to $f(T)$\ngravity to obtain a minimally coupled scalar field model, and thus no Einstein\nframe exists for $f(T)$ gravity. Furthermore nonminimally coupled \"teleparallel\ndark energy models\" are not conformally equivalent to $f(T)$ gravity. However,\nit can be shown that $f(T)$ gravity is conformally equivalent to a teleparallel\nphantom scalar field model with a nonminimal coupling to a boundary term only.\nIn this work, we extend this analysis by considering a recently studied\nextended class of models, known as $f(T,B)$ gravity, where $B$ is a boundary\nterm related to the divergence of a contraction of the torsion tensor. We find\nthat nonminimally coupled \"teleparallel dark energy models\" are conformally\nequivalent to either an $f(T,B)$ or $f(B)$ gravity model. Finally conditions on\nthe functional form of $f(T,B)$ gravity are derived to allow it to be\ntransformed to particular nonminimally coupled scalar field models.\n", "  Von Neumann and Wigner theorized the bounding and anti-crossing of\neigenstates. Experiments have demonstrated that owing to anti-crossing and\nsimilar radiation rates, the graphene-like resonance of inhomogeneously\nstrained photonic eigenstates can generate a pseudomagnetic field, bandgaps and\nLandau levels, whereas exponential or dissimilar rates induce non-Hermicity.\nHere, we experimentally demonstrate higher-order supersymmetry and quantum\nphase transitions by resonance between similar one-dimensional lattices. The\nlattices consisted of inhomogeneous strain-like phases of triangular solitons.\nThe resonance created two-dimensional, inhomogeneously deformed photonic\ngraphene. All parent eigenstates were annihilated. Eigenstates of mildly\nstrained solitons were annihilated at similar rates through one tail and\ngenerated Hermitian bounded eigenstates. The strongly strained solitons with\npositive phase defects were annihilated at exponential rates through one tail,\nwhich bounded eigenstates through non-Hermitianally generated exceptional\npoints. However, strongly strained solitons with negative defects were\neffectively amplified. Supersymmetry was evident, with preservation of the\nshapes and relative phase differences of the parent solitons. Localizations of\nenergies generated from annihilations of mildly and strongly strained soliton\neigenstates were responsible for geometrical (Berry) and topological phase\ntransitions, respectively. Both contributed to generating a quantum Zeno phase,\nwhereas only strong twists generated topological (Anderson) localization.\nAnti-bunching-like condensation was also observed.\n", "  Anharmonic vibrational calculations can already be computationally demanding\nfor relatively small molecules. The main bottlenecks lie in the construction of\nthe potential energy surface and in the size of the excitation space in the\nvibrational configuration interaction (VCI) calculations. To address these\nchallanges, we use localized-mode coordinates to construct potential energy\nsurfaces and perform vibrational self-consistent field (L-VSCF) and L-VCI\ncalculations [P. T. Panek, Ch. R. Jacob, ChemPhysChem 15, 3365 (2014)] for all\nvibrational modes of two prototypical test cases, the ethene and furan\nmolecules. We find that the mutual coupling between modes is reduced when\nswitching from normal-mode coordinates to localized-mode coordinates. When\nusing such localized-mode coordinates, we observe a faster convergence of the\n$n$-mode expansion of the potential energy surface. This makes it possible to\nneglect higher-order contributions in the $n$-mode expansion of the potential\nenergy surface or to approximate higher-oder contributions in hybrid potential\nenergy surfaces, which reduced the computational effort for the construction of\nthe anharmonic potential energy surface significantly. Moreover, we find that\nwhen using localized-mode coordinates, the convergence with respect to the VCI\nexcitation space proceeds more smoothly and that the error at low orders is\nreduced significantly. This makes it possible to devise low-cost models for\nobtaining a first approximation of anharmonic corrections. This demonstrates\nthat the use of localized-mode coordinates can be beneficial already in\nanharmonic vibrational calculations of small molecules, and provides a possible\navenue for enabling such accurate calculations also for larger molecules.\n", "  We theoretically discuss a momentum-space analog of the quantum Hall effect,\nwhich could be observed in topologically nontrivial lattice models subject to\nan external harmonic trapping potential. In our proposal, the Niu-Thouless-Wu\nformulation of the quantum Hall effect on a torus is realized in the toroidally\nshaped Brillouin zone. In this analogy, the position of the trap center in real\nspace controls the magnetic fluxes that are inserted through the holes of the\ntorus in momentum space. We illustrate the momentum-space quantum Hall effect\nwith the noninteracting trapped Harper-Hofstadter model, for which we\nnumerically demonstrate how this effect manifests itself in experimental\nobservables. Extension to the interacting trapped Harper-Hofstadter model is\nalso briefly considered. We finally discuss possible experimental platforms\nwhere our proposal for the momentum-space quantum Hall effect could be\nrealized.\n", "  The localization properties of eigenfunctions for two interacting particles\nin the one-dimensional Anderson model are studied for system sizes up to\n$N=5000$ sites corresponding to a Hilbert space of dimension $\\approx 10^7$\nusing the Green function Arnoldi method. The eigenfunction structure is\nillustrated in position, momentum and energy representation, the latter\ncorresponding to an expansion in non-interacting product eigenfunctions.\nDifferent types of localization lengths are computed for parameter ranges in\nsystem size, disorder and interaction strengths inaccessible until now. We\nconfirm that one-parameter scaling theory can be successfully applied provided\nthat the condition of $N$ being significantly larger than the one-particle\nlocalization length $L_1$ is verified. The enhancement effect of the\ntwo-particle localization length $L_2$ behaving as $L_2\\sim L_1^2$ is clearly\nconfirmed for a certain quite large interval of optimal interactions strengths.\nFurther new results for the interaction dependence in a very large interval, an\nenergy value outside the band center, and different interaction ranges are\nobtained.\n", "  Recent data on superflares on sun-like stars and radiocarbon data on solar\nactivity in the past are both indicative of transient epochs of unusually high\nmagnetic activity. We propose an explanation for the grand activity maxima in\nthe framework of a solar dynamo model with fluctuating parameters. Solar-type\ndynamos are oscillatory because of the combination of the solar-type\ndifferential rotation with positive (in the Northern hemisphere) alpha-effect.\nAn artificial reversal of the sign in the alpha-effect changes the dynamo to a\nsteady regime with hundreds of times larger magnetic energy compared to the\namplitude of the cyclic dynamo. Sufficiently large and durable fluctuations\nreversing the sign of the alpha-effect during the growth phase of a magnetic\ncycle can, therefore, cause a transient change to a steady dynamo with\nconsiderably increased magnetic energy. This qualitative scenario for grand\nactivity maxima is supported by computations of the dynamo model with a\nfluctuating alpha-effect. The computed statistics of several thousand magnetic\ncycles gives examples of cycles with very high magnetic energy. Our preliminary\nestimations, however, suggest that the probability of solar superflares is\nextremely low.\n", "  In high-$T_c$ cuprates many quantities exhibit a non-Fermi liquid\nuniversality hinting at a very peculiar structure of the underlying pairing\nmechanism for superconductivity: in this work we focus on the universality for\nthe in-plane resistivity and for the superfluid density.\n  We outline the previously developed spin-charge gauge approach to\nsuperconductivity in hole-doped cuprates: we decompose the hole of the $t-t'-J$\nmodel for the $\\mathrm{Cu}\\mathrm{O}_2$ planes as the product of a spinful,\nchargeless gapped spinon and of a spinless, charged holon with Fermi surface.\nEach one of these particle excitations is bound to a statistical gauge flux,\nallowing one to optimize their statistics.\n  We show that this model allows for a natural interpretation of the\nuniversality: within this approach, under suitable conditions, the spinonic and\nholonic contributions to a response function sum up according to a Ioffe-Larkin\nrule. We argue that, if the spinonic contribution dominates, then one should\nexpect strongly non-Fermi-liquid-like universality, due to the insensitivity of\nspinons to Fermi surface details. The in-plane resistivity and superfluid\ndensity are indeed dominated by the spinons in the underdoped region. We\ntheoretically derive these quantities, discussing their universal behaviours\nand comparing them with experimental data.\n", "  The frequency-dependent time delays in fast radio bursts (FRBs) can be used\nto constrain the photon mass, if the FRB redshifts are known, but the\nsimilarity between the frequency dependences of dispersion due to plasma\neffects and a photon mass complicates the derivation of a limit on $m_\\gamma$.\nThe dispersion measure (DM) of FRB 150418 is known to $\\sim 0.1$%, and there is\na claim to have measured its redshift with an accuracy of $\\sim 2$%, but the\nstrength of the constraint on $m_\\gamma$ is limited by uncertainties in the\nmodelling of the host galaxy and the Milky Way, as well as possible\ninhomogeneities in the intergalactic medium (IGM). Allowing for these\nuncertainties, the recent data on FRB 150418 indicate that $m_\\gamma \\lesssim\n1.8 \\times 10^{-14}$eV c$^{-2}$ ($3.2 \\times 10^{-50}$kg), if FRB 150418 indeed\nhas a redshift $z = 0.492$ as initially reported. In the future, the different\nredshift dependences of the plasma and photon mass contributions to DM can be\nused to improve the sensitivity to $m_\\gamma$ if more FRB redshifts are\nmeasured. For a fixed fractional uncertainty in the extra-galactic contribution\nto the DM of an FRB, one with a lower redshift would provide greater\nsensitivity to $m_\\gamma$.\n", "  We study the theoretical conditions to excite a stable self-oscillation in a\nspin torque oscillator with an in-plane magnetized free layer and a\nperpendicularly magnetized pinned layer in the presence of magnetic field\npointing in an arbitrary direction. The linearized Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert\n(LLG) equation is found to be inapplicable to evaluate the threshold between\nthe stable and self-oscillation states because the critical current density\nestimated from the linearized equation is considerably larger than that found\nin the numerical simulation. We derive a theoretical formula of the threshold\ncurrent density by focusing on the energy gain of the magnetization from the\nspin torque during a time shorter than a precession period. A good agreement\nbetween the derived formula and the numerical simulation is obtained. The\ncondition to stabilize the out-of-plane self-oscillation above the threshold is\nalso discussed.\n", "  The calculation of the discrete atomistic energy of a crystal near the\ncontinuum limit encounters difficulties caused by the geometric discrepancy\nbetween the continuum region occupied by the body, and the discrete collection\nof lattice points contained in it. This results in ambiguities in the\nasymptotic expansion of the energy for small values of the lattice parameter,\nthat are traced back to the lattice point problem of number theory. The\nlattice-cell average of the discrete energy is introduced and is shown to\neliminate this ambiguity in various circumstances. It is used to find explicit\ncontinuum expressions for surface energies and interfacial energies of coherent\nphase boundaries in deformed crystals in terms of the interatomic potential.\n", "  We construct an amplifier that interpolates between a nondeterministic,\nimmaculate linear amplifier and a deterministic, ideal linear amplifier and\nbeyond to nonideal linear amplifiers. The construction involves cascading an\nimmaculate linear amplifier that has amplitude gain $g_1$ with a (possibly)\nnonideal linear amplifier that has gain $g_2$. With respect to normally ordered\nmoments, the device has output noise $\\mu^2(G^2-1)$ where $G=g_1 g_2$ is the\noverall amplitude gain and $\\mu^2$ is a noise parameter. When $\\mu^2\\ge1$, our\ndevices realize ideal ($\\mu^2=1$) and nonideal ($\\mu^2>1$) linear amplifiers.\nWhen $0\\le\\mu^2<1$, these devices work effectively only over a restricted\nregion of phase space and with some subunity success probability\n$p_{\\checkmark}$. We investigate the performance of our $\\mu^2$-amplifiers in\nterms of a gain-corrected probability-fidelity product and the ratio of input\nto output signal-to-noise ratios corrected for success probability.\n", "  We present a simple yet accurate numerical approach to compute the free\nenergy of binding of multivalent objects on a receptor-coated surface. The\nmethod correctly accounts for the fact that one ligand can bind to at most one\nreceptor. The numerical approach is based on a saddle-point approximation to\nthe computation of a complex residue. We compare our theory with the powerful\nValence-Limited Interaction Theory (VLIT) (J. Chem. Phys. 137, 094108(2012), J.\nChem. Phys. 138, 021102(2013)) and find excellent agreement in the regime where\nthat theory is expected to work. However, the present approach even works for\nlow receptor/ligand densities, where VLIT breaks down.\n", "  The advent of quantum devices, which exploit the two essential elements of\nquantum physics, coherence and entanglement, has sparked renewed interest in\nthe control of open quantum systems. Successful implementations face the\nchallenge to preserve the relevant nonclassical features at the level of device\noperation. A major obstacle is decoherence which is caused by interaction with\nthe environment. Optimal control theory is a tool that can be used to identify\ncontrol strategies in the presence of decoherence. We review here recent\nadvances in optimal control methodology that allow for tackling typical tasks\nin device operation for open quantum systems and discuss examples of\nrelaxation-optimized dynamics. Optimal control theory is also a useful tool to\nexploit the environment for control. We discuss examples and point out possible\nfuture extensions.\n", "  In the presence of Lorentz violation, the Cerenkov-like process\n$\\gamma\\rightarrow\\gamma+\\pi^{0}$ may become allowed for sufficiently energetic\nphotons. Photons above the threshold would lose energy rapidly through pion\nemission. The fact that propagating photons with energies of up to 80 TeV\nsurvive to be observed on Earth allows us to place a one-sided constraint on an\nisotropic Lorentz violating parameter at the $7\\times 10^{-13}$ level; this is\nmore than an order of magnitude better than best previous result.\n", "  We present the massless six-point one-loop amplitudes in the open and closed\nsuperstring using BRST cohomology arguments from the pure spinor formalism. The\nhexagon gauge anomaly is traced back to a class of kinematic factors in pure\nspinor superspace which were recently introduced as BRST pseudo-invariants.\nThis complements previous work where BRST invariance arguments were used to\nderive the non-anomalous part of the amplitude. The associated worldsheet\nfunctions are non-singular and demonstrated to yield total derivatives on\nmoduli space upon gauge variation. These cohomology considerations yield an\nefficient organizing principle for closed-string amplitudes that match\nexpectations from S-duality in the low-energy limit.\n", "  The improvement in the fabrication techniques of iron-based superconductors\nhave made these materials real competitors of high temperature superconductors\nand MgB$_2$. In particular, iron-chalcogenides have proved to be the most\npromising for the realization of high current carrying tapes. But their use on\na large scale cannot be achieved without the understanding of the current\nstability mechanisms in these compounds. Indeed, we have recently observed the\npresence of flux flow instabilities features in Fe(Se,Te) thin films grown on\nCaF$_2$. Here we present the results of current-voltage characterizations at\ndifferent temperatures and applied magnetic fields on Fe(Se,Te) microbridges\ngrown on CaF$_2$. These results will be analyzed from the point of view of the\nmost validated models with the aim to identify the nature of the flux flow\ninstabilities features (i.e., thermal or electronic), in order to give a\nfurther advance to the high current carrying capability of iron-chalcogenide\nsuperconductors.\n", "  Kuiper Belt objects with absolute magnitude less than 3 (radius $\\gtrsim$500\nkm), the dwarf planets, have a range of different ice/rock ratios, and are more\nrock-rich than their smaller counterparts. Many of these objects have moons,\nwhich suggests that collisions may have played a role in modifying their\ncompositions. We show that the dwarf planets fall into two categories when\nanalysed by their mean densities and satellite-to-primary size ratio. Systems\nwith large moons, such as Pluto/Charon and Orcus/Vanth, can form in\nlow-velocity grazing collisions in which both bodies retain their compositions.\nWe propose that these systems retain a primordial composition, with a density\nof about 1.8 g/cm$^3$. Triton, thought to be a captured KBO, could have lost\nenough ice during its early orbital evolution to explain its rock-enrichment\nrelative to the primordial material. Systems with small moons, Eris, Haumea,\nand Quaoar, formed from a different type of collision in which icy material,\nperhaps a few tens of percent of the total colliding mass, is lost. The\nfragments would not remain in physical or dynamical proximity to the parent\nbody. The ice loss process has not yet been demonstrated numerically, which\ncould be due to the paucity of KBO origin simulations, or missing physical\nprocesses in the impact models. If our hypothesis is correct, we predict that\nlarge KBOs with small moons should be denser than the primordial material, and\nthat the mean density of Orcus should be close to the primordial value.\n", "  The random acceleration model is one of the simplest non-Markovian stochastic\nsystems and has been widely studied in connection with applications in physics\nand mathematics. However, the occupation time and related properties are\nnon-trivial and not yet completely understood. In this paper we consider the\noccupation time $T_+$ of the one-dimensional random acceleration model on the\npositive half-axis. We calculate the first two moments of $T_+$ analytically\nand also study the statistics of $T_+$ with Monte Carlo simulations. One goal\nof our work was to ascertain whether the occupation time $T_+$ and the time\n$T_m$ at which the maximum of the process is attained are statistically\nequivalent. For regular Brownian motion the distributions of $T_+$ and $T_m$\ncoincide and are given by L\\'evy's arcsine law. We show that for randomly\naccelerated motion the distributions of $T_+$ and $T_m$ are quite similar but\nnot identical. This conclusion follows from the exact results for the moments\nof the distributions and is also consistent with our Monte Carlo simulations.\n", "  In a previous article [J. Chem. Phys. 138, 084108 (2013)], we showed that the\n$t\\to 0_+$ limit of ring-polymer molecular dynamics (RPMD) rate-theory is also\nthe $t\\to 0_+$ limit of a new type of quantum flux-side time-correlation\nfunction, in which the dividing surfaces are invariant to imaginary-time\ntranslation; in other words, that RPMD transition-state theory (RPMD-TST) is a\n$t\\to 0_+$ quantum transition-state theory (QTST). Recently, Jang and Voth [J.\nChem. Phys. 144, 084110 (2016)] rederived this quantum $t\\to 0_+$ limit, and\nclaimed that it gives instead the centroid-density approximation. Here we show\nthat the $t\\to 0_+$ limit derived by Jang and Voth is in fact RPMD-TST.\n", "  Starting from a phenomenologically successful, numerical solution of the\nDyson-Schwinger equation that governs the quark propagator, we reconstruct in\ndetail the interaction kernel that has to enter the instantaneous approximation\nto the Bethe-Salpeter equation to allow us to describe the lightest\npseudoscalar mesons as quark-antiquark bound states exhibiting the (almost)\nmasslessness necessary for them to be interpretable as the (pseudo) Goldstone\nbosons related to the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking of quantum\nchromodynamics.\n", "  The new soft theorems, for both gravity and gauge amplitudes, have inspired a\nnumber of works, including the discovery of new identities related to\namplitudes. In this note, we present the proof and discussion for two sets of\nidentities. The first set includes an identity involving the half-soft function\nwhich had been used in the soft theorem for one-loop rational gravity\namplitudes, and another simpler identity as its byproduct. The second set\nincludes two identities involving the KLT momentum kernel, as the consistency\nconditions of the KLT relation plus soft theorems for both gravity and gauge\namplitudes. We use the CHY formulation to prove the first identity, and\ntransform the second one into a convenient form for future discussion.\n", "  The Gribov ambiguity exists in various gauges except algebraic gauges.\nHowever, algebraic gauges are not Lorentz invariant, which is their fundamental\nflaw. In addition, they are not generally compatible with the boundary\nconditions on the gauge fields, which are needed to compactify the space i.e.,\nthe ambiguity continues to exist on a compact manifold. Here we discuss a\nquadratic gauge fixing, which is Lorentz invariant. We consider an example of a\nspherically symmetric gauge field configuration in which we prove that this\nLorentz invariant gauge removes the ambiguity on a compact manifold\n$\\mathbb{S}^3$, when a proper boundary condition on the gauge configuration is\ntaken into account. Thus, providing one example where the ambiguity is absent\non a compact manifold in the algebraic gauge. We also show that the \\tmem{BRST}\ninvariance is preserved in this gauge.\n", "  In the most general case of the Delta exact operator valued generators\nconstructed of an arbitrary Fermion operator, we present a closed solution for\nthe transformed master action in terms of the original master action in the\nclosed form of the corresponding path integral. We show in detail how that path\nintegral reduces to the known result in the case of being the Delta exact\ngenerators constructed of an arbitrary Fermion function.\n", "  A novel NMR experimental scheme, called wide band continuous wave NMR, is\npresented in this article.\n", "  When an electronic system has strong correlations and a large spin-orbit\ninteraction, it often exhibits a plethora of mutually competing quantum phases.\nHow a particular quantum ground state is selected out of several possibilities\nis a very interesting question. However, equally fascinating is how such a\nquantum entangled state breaks up due to perturbation. This important question\nhas relevance in very diverse fields of science from strongly correlated\nelectron physics to quantum information. Here we report that a quantum\nentangled dimerized state or valence bond crystal (VBC) phase of Li2RuO3 shows\nnontrivial doping dependence as we perturb the Ru honeycomb lattice by\nreplacing Ru with Li. Through extensive experimental studies, we demonstrate\nthat the VBC phase melts into a valence bond liquid phase of the RVB\n(resonating valence bond) type. This system offers an interesting playground\nwhere one can test and refine our current understanding of the quantum\ncompeting phases in a single compound.\n", "  Superparamagnetic nanoparticles containing hundreds and thousands of coupled\nelectron spins are on the boundary between classical and quantum behavior, and\ndemonstrate features which are typical for paramagnetic spins and absent in\nmacroscopic ferromagnetic systems. In order to better understand the evolution\nof magnetization dynamics from quantum to classical behavior with the increase\nin the system size, we study the electron magnetic resonance signal in\nsuspensions of iron oxide nanoparticles as the function of the particle size.\nThe experimental data are compared with numerical simulations based on the\ngiant spin approach.\n", "  We study numerically the two-dimensional Ising model with non-conserved\ndynamics quenched from an initial equilibrium state at the temperature $T_i\\ge\nT_c$ to a final temperature $T_f$ below the critical one. By considering\nprocesses initiating both from a disordered state at infinite temperature\n$T_i=\\infty$ and from the critical configurations at $T_i=T_c$ and spanning the\nrange of final temperatures $T_f\\in [0,T_c[$ we elucidate the role played by\n$T_i$ and $T_f$ on the aging properties and, in particular, on the behavior of\nthe autocorrelation $C$ and of the integrated response function $\\chi$. Our\nresults show that for any choice of $T_f$, while the autocorrelation function\nexponent $\\lambda _C$ takes a markedly different value for $T_i=\\infty$\n[$\\lambda _C(T_i=\\infty)\\simeq 5/4$] or $T_i=T_c$ [$\\lambda _C(T_i=T_c)\\simeq\n1/8$] the response function exponents are unchanged. Supported by the outcome\nof the analytical solution of the solvable spherical model we interpret this\nfact as due to the different contributions provided to autocorrelation and\nresponse by the large-scale properties of the system. As changing $T_f$ is\nconsidered, although this is expected to play no role in the\nlarge-scale/long-time properties of the system, we show important effects on\nthe quantitative behavior of $\\chi$. In particular, data for quenches to\n$T_f=0$ are consistent with a value of the response function exponent $\\lambda\n_\\chi=\\frac{1}{2}\\lambda _C(T_i=\\infty)=5/8$ different from the one [$\\lambda\n_\\chi \\in (0.5-0.56)$] found in a wealth of previous numerical determinations\nin quenches to finite final temperatures. This is interpreted as due to\nimportant pre-asymptotic corrections associated to $T_f>0$.\n", "  I'm presenting a new elegant formulation of the theory of fully nonlinear\nadiabatic TWM (FNA-TWM) in terms of elliptic function here. Note that the\nlinear case of SFG and DFG in the undepleted pump approximation described by\nthe FVH representation has been exploited several years ago. For the sake of\ncompleteness, I present the pseudo-FVH representation to describe OPA.\nMoreover, I'm trying to display an overview of TWM processes and show that both\nthe linear cases, the linear adiabatic SFG(DFG) and the linear OPA, are only\nthe special cases of my theory. Finally I also point out that the geometric\nimage of the so-called adiabatic basis acts as the geodesic line of the\ngeneralized Bloch sphere.\n", "  CLIO is a Free Electron Laser based on a thermionic electron gun. In its\nnormal operating mode it delivers electron 8 pulses but studies are ongoing to\nshorten the pulses to about 1 ps. We report on simulations showing how the\npulse can be shortened and the expected signal yield from several bunch length\ndiagnostics (Coherent Transition Radiation, Coherent Smith Purcell Radiation).\n", "  We use the T-matrix formalism in combination with the method of far-field\nmatching to evaluate the optical force exerted by Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) light\nbeams on a spherical (Mie) particle. For both non-vortex and optical vortex LG\nbeams, the theoretical results are used to analyze the optical-force-induced\ndynamics of the scatterer near the trapping points represented by the\nequilibrium (zero-force) positions. The regimes of linearized dynamics are\ndescribed in terms of the stiffness matrix spectrum and the damping constant of\nthe ambient medium. For the purely azimuthal LG beams, the dynamics is found to\nbe locally non-conservative and is characterized by the presence of\nconditionally stable equilibria (unstable zero-force points that can be\nstabilized by the ambient damping). The effects related to the Mie resonances\nthat under certain conditions manifest themselves as the points changing the\ntrapping properties of the particles are discussed.\n", "  Simulations show Gly$_{15}$, a polypeptide lacking any side-chains, can\ncollapse in water. We assess the hydration thermodynamics in this collapse by\ncalculating the hydration free energy at each of the end points of the reaction\ncoordinate, here the end-to-end distance ($r$) in the chain. To examine the\nrole of the various conformations for a given $r$, we study the conditional\ndistribution, $P(R_g | r)$, of the radius of gyration for a given value of $r$.\n$P(R_g|r)$ is found to vary more gently compared to the corresponding variation\nin the excess hydration free energy. Using this insight within a multistate\ngeneralization of the potential distribution theorem, we calculate a reasonable\nupper bound for the hydration free energy of the peptide for a given $r$. On\nthis basis we find that peptide hydration greatly favors the expanded state of\nthe chain, despite primitive hydrophobic effects favoring chain collapse. The\nnet free energy of collapse is seen to be a delicate balance between opposing\nintra-peptide and hydration effects, with intra-peptide contributions favoring\ncollapse by a small margin. The favorable intra-peptide interactions are\nprimarily electrostatic in origin, and found to arise primarily from\ninteraction between C=O dipoles, hydrogen bonding interaction between C=O and\nN-H groups, and favorable interaction between N-H dipoles.\n", "  We report on a systematic study of double-gap and four-gap phenolic resistive\nplate chambers (RPCs) for future high-{\\eta} RPC triggers in the CMS. In the\npresent study, we constructed real-sized double-gap and four-gap RPCs with gap\nthicknesses of 1.6 and 0.8 mm, respectively, with 2-mm-thick phenolic\nhigh-pressure-laminated (HPL) plates. We examined the prototype RPCs for cosmic\nrays and 100 GeV muons provided by the SPS H4 beam line at CERN. We applied\nmaximum gamma rates of 1.5 kHz cm-2 provided by 137Cs sources at Korea\nUniversity and the GIF++ irradiation facility installed at the SPS H4 beam line\nto examine the rate capabilities of the prototype RPCs. In contrast to the case\nof the four-gap RPCs, we found the relatively high threshold was conducive to\neffectively suppressing the rapid increase of strip cluster sizes of muon hits\nwith high voltage, especially when measuring the narrow-pitch strips. The\ngamma-induced currents drawn in the four-gap RPC were about one-fourth of those\ndrawn in the double-gap RPC. The rate capabilities of both RPC types, proven\nthrough the present testing using gamma-ray sources, far exceeded the maximum\nrate expected in the new high-{\\eta} endcap RPCs planned for future phase-II\nLHC runs.\n", "  We present BOND, a Bayesian code to simultaneously derive oxygen and nitrogen\nabundances in giant H II regions. It compares observed emission lines to a grid\nof photoionization models without assuming any relation between O/H and N/O.\nOur grid spans a wide range in O/H, N/O and ionization parameter U, and covers\ndifferent starburst ages and nebular geometries. Varying starburst ages\naccounts for variations in the ionizing radiation field hardness, which arise\ndue to the ageing of H II regions or the stochastic sampling of the initial\nmass function. All previous approaches assume a strict relation between the\nionizing field and metallicity. The other novelty is extracting information on\nthe nebular physics from semi-strong emission lines. While strong lines ratios\nalone ([O III]/Hbeta, [O II]/Hbeta and [N II]/Hbeta) lead to multiple O/H\nsolutions, the simultaneous use of [Ar III]/[Ne III] allows one to decide\nwhether an H II region is of high or low metallicity. Adding He I/Hbeta pins\ndown the hardness of the radiation field. We apply our method to H II regions\nand blue compact dwarf galaxies, and find that the resulting N/O vs O/H\nrelation is as scattered as the one obtained from the temperature-based method.\nAs in previous strong-line methods calibrated on photoionization models, the\nBOND O/H values are generally higher than temperature-based ones, which might\nindicate the presence of temperature fluctuations or kappa distributions in\nreal nebulae, or a too soft ionizing radiation field in the models.\n", "  How may we quantify the value of physical resources, such as entangled\nquantum states, heat baths or lasers? Existing resource theories give us\npartial answers; however, these rely on idealizations, like perfectly\nindependent copies of states or exact knowledge of a quantum state. Here we\nintroduce the general tool of currencies to quantify realistic descriptions of\nresources, applicable in experimental settings when we do not have perfect\ncontrol over a physical system, when only the neighbourhood of a state or some\nof its properties are known, or when there is no obvious way to decompose a\nglobal space into subsystems. Currencies are a special set of resources chosen\nto quantify all others - like Bell pairs in LOCC or a lifted weight in\nthermodynamics. We show that from very weak assumptions on the theory we can\nalready find useful currencies that give us necessary and sufficient conditions\nfor resource conversion, and we build up more results as we impose further\nstructure. This work is an application of Resource theories of knowledge\n[arXiv:1511.08818], generalizing axiomatic approaches to thermodynamic entropy,\nwork and currencies made of local copies.\n", "  Plasmonic chirality exhibits great potential for novel nanooptical devices\ndue to the generation of a strong chiroptical response. Previous reports on\nplasmonic chirality explanations are mainly based on phase retardation and\ncoupling. We propose a quantitative model similar to the chiral molecules for\nexplaining the mechanism of the intrinsic plasmonic chirality quantitatively\nbased on the interplay and mixing of electric and magnetic dipole modes, which\nforms a mixed electric and magnetic polarizability. The analysis method is also\nsuitable for small chiral object down to quasi-static limit without phase delay\nand expected to be a universal rule.\n", "  We substitute the fully absorbing obstacle in the Elitzur-Vaidman experiment\nby a semitransparent object and show that the probabilities of detection can be\nmanipulated in dependence of the transparency of such an object. Then, we\nconnect our results with the delayed choice experiment proposed by Wheeler. It\nis found that the transparency of the obstacle determines either a\nparticle-like or a wave-like behaviour of a test photon.\n", "  The applicability of the factorization method is extended to the case of\nquantum fractional-differential Hamiltonians. In contrast with the conventional\nfactorization, it is shown that the `factorization energy' is now a\nfractional-differential operator rather than a constant. As a first example,\nthe energies and wave-functions of a fractional version of the quantum\noscillator are determined. Interestingly, the energy eigenvalues are expressed\nas power-laws of the momentum in terms of the non-integer differential order of\nthe eigenvalue equation.\n", "  We discuss the relation between lepton number violation at high and low\nenergies, particularly, the constraints on baryogenesis models, which would be\nimplied by an observation of neutrinoless double beta decay. The primordial\nbaryon asymmetry can be washed out by effective lepton number violating\noperators triggering neutrinoless double beta decay in combination with\nsphaleron processes. A generic conclusion is that popular models of\nbaryogenesis are excluded if a non-standard mechanism of neutrinoless double\nbeta decay, i.e., other than the standard light neutrino exchange, is observed.\nApart from the effective field approach, we also outline the possible extension\nof our arguments to a general UV-completed model.\n", "  Public Goods Games represent one of the most useful tools to study group\ninteractions between individuals. However, even if they could provide an\nexplanation for the emergence and stability of cooperation in modern societies,\nthey are not able to reproduce some key features observed in social and\neconomical interactions. The typical shape of wealth distribution - known as\nPareto Law - and the microscopic organization of wealth production are two of\nthem. Here, we introduce a modification to the classical formulation of Public\nGoods Games that allows for the emergence of both of these features from first\nprinciples. Unlike traditional Public Goods Games on networks, where players\ncontribute equally to all the games in which they participate, we allow\nindividuals to redistribute their contribution according to what they earned in\nprevious rounds. Results from numerical simulations show that not only a Pareto\ndistribution for the payoffs naturally emerges but also that if players don't\ninvest enough in one round they can act as defectors even if they are formally\ncooperators. Finally, we also show that the players self-organize in a very\nproductive backbone that covers almost perfectly the minimum spanning tree of\nthe underlying interaction network. Our results not only give an explanation\nfor the presence of the wealth heterogeneity observed in real data but also\npoints to a conceptual change regarding how cooperation is defined in\ncollective dilemmas.\n", "  In this prize talk, I recall some of the history surrounding the discovery of\ndeeply virtual Compton scattering, and explain why it is an exciting\nexperimental tool to obtain novel tomographic pictures of the nucleons at\nJefferson Lab 12 GeV facility and the planned Electron-Ion Collider in the\nUnited States.\n", "  Starting from a constrained real $BF$-type action for general relativity that\nincludes both the Immirzi parameter and the cosmological constant, we obtain\nthe Ashtekar-Barbero variables used in the canonical approach to the\nquantization of the gravitational field. This is accomplished by explicitly\nsolving the second-class constraints resulting from the Hamiltonian analysis of\nthe considered action, and later imposing the time gauge. All throughout this\nwork the tetrad formalism is left aside, obtaining the Ashtekar-Barbero\nvariables entirely in terms of the $B$-fields that define the action.\n", "  Atomically thin boron nitride (BN) is an important two-dimensional (2D)\nnanomaterial, with many properties distinct from graphene. In this feature\narticle, these unique properties and associated applications often not possible\nfrom graphene are outlined. The article starts with characterization and\nidentification of atomically thin BN. It is followed by demonstrating their\nstrong oxidation resistance at high temperatures and applications in protecting\nmetals from oxidation and corrosion. As flat insulators, BN nanosheets are\nideal dielectric substrates for surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) and\nelectronic devices based on 2D heterostructures. The light emission of BN\nnanosheets in the deep ultraviolet (DUV) and ultraviolet (UV) regions are also\nincluded for its scientific and technological importance. The last part is\ndedicated to synthesis, characterization, and optical properties of BN\nnanoribbons, a special form of nanosheets.\n", "  The layered compound with distorted Kagome nets, Dy3Ru4Al12, was previously\nreported to undergo antiferromagnetic ordering below (TN=) 7 K, based on\ninvestigations on single crystals. Here, we report the results of our\ninvestigation of ac and dc magnetic susceptibility (\\c{hi}), isothermal remnant\nmagnetization (MIRM), heat-capacity, magnetocaloric effect and\nmagnetoresistance measurements on polycrystals. The present results reveal that\nthere is an additional magnetic anomaly around 20 K, as though the N\\'eel order\nis preceded by the formation of ferromagnetic clusters. We attribute this\nfeature to geometric frustration of magnetism. In view of the existence of this\nphase, the interpretation of the linear-term in the heat-capacity in terms of\nspin-fluctuations from the Ru 4d band needs to be revisited. Additionally, in\nthe vicinity of TN, AC \\c{hi} shows a prominent frequency dependence and, below\nTN, MIRM exhibits a slow decay with time. This raises a question whether the\nantiferromagnetic structure in this compound is characterized by\nspin-glass-like dynamics. In contrast to what was reported earlier, there is a\nchange in the sign of the magnetoresistance (MR) at the metamagnetic\ntransition. A butter-fly-shaped (isothermal) MR loop (interestingly spanning\nover all the four quadrants) is observed at 2 K with distinct evidence for the\nmagnetic phase co-existence phenomenon in zero field after travelling through\nmetamagnetic transition field. The results on polycrystals thus provide\nadditional information about the magnetism of this compound, revealing that the\nmagnetism of this compound is more complex than what is believed, due to\ngeometric frustration intrinsic to Kagome net.\n", "  In this paper we make re-analysis of a self-similarity based model of the\nproton structure function at small $x$ pursued in recent years. The additional\nassumption is that it should be singularity free in the entire kinematic range\n$0\\leq \\textit{x}\\leq 1$. Our analysis indicates that the singularity free\nversion of the model is valid in a more restrictive range of $Q^{2}$. We then\nanalyse the defining Transverse Momentum Dependent Parton Distributions (TMD)\noccurred in the models and show that the proper generalizations and initial\nconditions on them not only remove the undesired singularity but also results\nin a QCD compatible structure function with logarithmic growth in $Q^2$. The\nphenomenological range of validity is then found to be much larger than the\nearlier versions. We also extrapolate the models to large $x$ in a parameter\nfree way.\n", "  We combined photographic, photoelectric and CCD observations of the nova-like\nvariable V380 Oph to get a light curve spanning the time range of 40 years.\nWhile the typical high-state brightness of V380 Oph was R~14.5, two\nlow-brightness episodes identified in 1979 (B_pg~17.5) and 2015 (R~19) confirm\nits classification as a VY Scl-type \"anti-dwarf nova\". The Fourier period\nanalysis of photoelectric and CCD V and B observations obtained in 2002-16\nrevealed the presence of two periods 0.148167d and 4.287d, that may be\nassociated with negative superhumps and disc precession. We also compared\nmeasurements obtained with the iris micro-photometer and flatbed scanner at the\nsame plates and found an agreement within the expected accuracy of photographic\nphotometry.\n", "  Atomically thin two-dimensional crystals have revolutionized materials\nscience. In particular, monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides promise\nnovel optoelectronic applications, due to their direct energy gaps in the\noptical range. Their electronic and optical properties, however, are\ncomplicated by exotic room-temperature excitons, whose fundamental structure\nand dynamics has been under intense investigation. While interband spectroscopy\nprobes energies of excitons with vanishing centre-of-mass momenta, the majority\nof excitons has remained elusive, raising questions about their unusual\ninternal structure, symmetry, many-body effects, and dynamics. Here we report\nthe first direct experimental access to all relevant excitons in single-layer\nWSe2. Phase-locked mid-infrared pulses reveal the internal orbital 1s-2p\nresonance, which is highly sensitive to the shape of the excitonic envelope\nfunctions and provides accurate transition energies, oscillator strengths,\ndensities and linewidths. Remarkably, the observed decay dynamics indicates a\nrecord fast radiative annihilation of small-momentum excitons within 150 fs,\nwhereas Auger recombination prevails for optically dark states. The results\nprovide a comprehensive view of excitons and introduce a new degree of freedom\nfor quantum control, optoelectronics and valleytronics of dichalcogenide\nmonolayers.\n", "  For an arbitrary open, nonempty, bounded set $\\Omega \\subset \\mathbb{R}^n$,\n$n \\in \\mathbb{N}$, and sufficiently smooth coefficients $a,b,q$, we consider\nthe closed, strictly positive, higher-order differential operator $A_{\\Omega,\n2m} (a,b,q)$ in $L^2(\\Omega)$ defined on $W_0^{2m,2}(\\Omega)$, associated with\nthe higher-order differential expression $$ \\tau_{2m} (a,b,q) :=\n\\bigg(\\sum_{j,k=1}^{n} (-i \\partial_j - b_j) a_{j,k} (-i \\partial_k -\nb_k)+q\\bigg)^m, \\quad m \\in \\mathbb{N}, $$ and its Krein--von Neumann extension\n$A_{K, \\Omega, 2m} (a,b,q)$ in $L^2(\\Omega)$. Denoting by $N(\\lambda; A_{K,\n\\Omega, 2m} (a,b,q))$, $\\lambda > 0$, the eigenvalue counting function\ncorresponding to the strictly positive eigenvalues of $A_{K, \\Omega, 2m}\n(a,b,q)$, we derive the bound $$ N(\\lambda; A_{K, \\Omega, 2m} (a,b,q)) \\leq C\nv_n (2\\pi)^{-n} \\bigg(1+\\frac{2m}{2m+n}\\bigg)^{n/(2m)} \\lambda^{n/(2m)} , \\quad\n\\lambda > 0, $$ where $C = C(a,b,q,\\Omega)>0$ (with $C(I_n,0,0,\\Omega) =\n|\\Omega|$) is connected to the eigenfunction expansion of the self-adjoint\noperator $\\widetilde A_{2m} (a,b,q)$ in $L^2(\\mathbb{R}^n)$ defined on\n$W^{2m,2}(\\mathbb{R}^n)$, corresponding to $\\tau_{2m} (a,b,q)$. Here $v_n :=\n\\pi^{n/2}/\\Gamma((n+2)/2)$ denotes the (Euclidean) volume of the unit ball in\n$\\mathbb{R}^n$.\n  Our method of proof relies on variational considerations exploiting the\nfundamental link between the Krein--von Neumann extension and an underlying\nabstract buckling problem, and on the distorted Fourier transform defined in\nterms of the eigenfunction transform of $\\widetilde A_{2} (a,b,q)$ in\n$L^2(\\mathbb{R}^n)$.\n  We also consider the analogous bound for the eigenvalue counting function for\nthe Friedrichs extension $A_{F,\\Omega, 2m} (a,b,q)$ in $L^2(\\Omega)$ of\n$A_{\\Omega, 2m} (a,b,q)$.\n  No assumptions on the boundary $\\partial \\Omega$ of $\\Omega$ are made.\n", "  We present a method of constructing discrete integrable systems with\ncrystallographic reflection group (Weyl) symmetries, thus clarifying the\nrelationship between different discrete integrable systems in terms of their\nsymmetry groups. Discrete integrable systems are associated with space-filling\npolytopes arise from the geometric representation of the Weyl groups in the\n$n$-dimensional real Euclidean space $\\mathbb{R}^n$. The \"multi-dimensional\nconsistency\" property of the discrete integrable system is shown to be\ninherited from the combinatorial properties of the polytope; while the dynamics\nof the system is described by the affine translations of the polytopes on the\nweight lattices of the Weyl groups. The connections between some well-known\ndiscrete systems such as the multi-dimensional consistent systems of\nquad-equations \\cite{abs:03} and discrete Painlev\\'e equations \\cite{sak:01}\nare obtained via the geometric constraints that relate the polytope of one\nsymmetry group to that of another symmetry group, a procedure which we call\ngeometric reduction.\n", "  Hodographs for the Kepler problem are circles. This fact, known since almost\ntwo centuries ago, still provides the simplest path to derive the Kepler first\nlaw. Through Feynman `lost lecture', this derivation has now reached to a wider\naudience. Here we look again at Feynman's approach to this problem as well as\nat the recently suggested modification by van Haandel and Heckman (vHH), with\ntwo aims in view, both of which extend the scope of the approach.\n  First we review the geometric constructions of the Feynman and vHH approaches\n(that prove the existence of {\\itshape elliptic} orbits without making use of\nintegral calculus or differential equations) and then we extend the geometric\napproach to cover also the {\\itshape hyperbolic} orbits (corresponding to\n$E>0$). In the second part we analyse the properties of the director circles of\nthe conics, which are used to simplify the approach and we relate with the\nproperties of the hodographs and with the Laplace-Runge-Lenz vector, the\nconstant of motion specific to the Kepler problem. Finally, we briefly discuss\nthe generalisation of the geometric method to the Kepler problem in\nconfiguration spaces of constant curvature, i.e. in the sphere and the\nhyperbolic plane.\n", "  Quantum dynamical maps are defined and studied for quantum statistical\nphysics based on Orlicz spaces. This complements earlier work [W. A. Majewski,\nL.E. Labuschagne, Ann. H. Poincare. 15, 1197-1221, (2014)] where we made a\nstrong case for the assertion that statistical physics of regular systems\nshould properly be based on the pair of Orlicz spaces $\\langle L^{\\cosh - 1},\nL\\log(L+1)\\rangle$. The present paper therefore in some sense \"completes\" the\npicture by showing that even in the most general non-commutative contexts,\ncompletely positive Markov maps satisfying a natural Detailed Balance\ncondition, canonically admit an action on a large class of quantum Orlicz\nspaces. This is achieved by the development of a new interpolation technique,\nspecifically suited to the above context, for extending the action of such maps\nto the appropriate intermediate spaces of the pair $\\langle\nL^\\infty,L^1\\rangle$. Moreover, it is shown that quantum dynamics in the form\nof Markov semigroups described by some Dirichlet forms naturally extends to the\ncontext proposed in [W. A. Majewski, L.E. Labuschagne, Ann. H. Poincare. 15,\n1197-1221, (2014)].\n", "  How did galaxies form and evolve? This is one of the most challenging\nquestions in astronomy to- day. Answering it requires a careful combination of\nobservational and theoretical work to reliably determine the observed\nproperties of cosmic bodies over large portions of the distant Universe on the\none hand, and accurately model the physical processes driving their evolution\non the other. Most importantly, it requires bringing together disparate\nmulti-wavelength and multi-resolution spectro-photometric datasets in an\nhomogeneous and well-characterized manner so that they are suitable for a\nrigorous statistical analysis. The Herschel Extragalactic Legacy Project (HELP)\nfunded by the EC FP7 SPACE program aims to achieve this goal by combining the\nexpertise of optical, infrared and radio astronomers to provide a\nmulti-wavelength database for the dis- tant Universe as an accessible\nvalue-added resource for the astronomical community. It will do so by bringing\ntogether multi-wavelength datasets covering the 1000 deg2 mapped by Herschel\nextragalactic surveys and thus creating a joint lasting legacy from several\nambitious sky surveys.\n", "  If the astronomical dark matter is made of weakly interacting, massive and\nstable species, it should annihilate on itself into particles. This process\nshould produce rare antimatter cosmic rays and lead to distortions in their\nenergy distributions. The AMS-02 spectrometer has been measuring them with\nunprecedented accuracy. It is timely to investigate if anomalies have been\nfound in the positron and antiproton spectra and if so, if they indirectly\npoint toward the presence of DM particles annihilating inside the Milky Way.\n", "  We use numerical simulations to investigate the interaction of an $f$-mode\nwave packet with small and large models of a sunspot in a stratified\natmosphere. While a loose cluster model has been largely studied before, we\nfocus in this study on the scattering from an ensemble of tightly compact\ntubes. We showed that the small compact cluster produces a slight distorted\nscattered wave field in the transverse direction, which can be attributed to\nthe simultaneous oscillations of the pairs of tubes within the cluster aligned\nin a perpendicular direction to the incoming wave. However, no signature of a\nmultiple-scattering regime has been observed from this model, while it has been\nclearly observable for the large compact cluster model. Furthermore, we pointed\nout the importance of the geometrical shape of the monolithic model on the\ninteraction of $f$-mode waves with a sunspot in a high frequency range ($\\nu =$\n5 mHz). These results are a contribution to the observational effort to\ndistinguish seismically between different configurations of magnetic flux tubes\nwithin sunspots and plage.\n", "  This report summarizes some of the material that was presented by the author\nduring the 2015 Les Houches Summerschool on \"Random Matrices and Stochastic\nProcesses\". In these Lectures, various applications of Random Matrix Theory in\nmodern telecommunications are reviewed. The aim is to introduce the Physics\ncommunity to a number of relevant problems that can be analyzed using such\ntools, while at the same time briefly describing the way these methods are\napplied. More specifically, two applications on wireless communications and two\non optical communications are presented.\n", "  We study the robustness of interdependent networks where two networks are\nsaid to be interdependent if the operation of one network depends on the\noperation of the other one, and vice versa. In this paper, we propose a model\nfor analyzing bidirectional interdependent networks with known topology. We\ndefine the metric MR(D) to be the minimum number of nodes that should be\nremoved from one network to cause the failure of D nodes in the other network\ndue to cascading failures. We prove that evaluating this metric is not only\nNP-complete, but also inapproximable. Next, we propose heuristics for\nevaluating this metric and compare their performances using simulation results.\nFinally, we introduce two closely related definitions for robust design of\ninterdependent networks; propose algorithms for explicit design, and\ndemonstrate the relation between robust interdependent networks and expander\ngraphs.\n", "  In this work we provide a framework for modeling compact stars in which the\ninterior matter distribution obeys a generalised Chaplygin equation of state.\nThe interior geometry of the stellar object is described by a spherically\nsymmetric line element which is simultaneously comoving and isotropic with the\nexterior spacetime being vacuum. We are able to integrate the Einstein field\nequations and present closed form solutions which adequately describe compact\nstrange star candidates like Her X-1, RX J 1856-37, PSRJ 1614-2230 and SAX\nJ1808.4-3658.\n", "  It is known that neutron background is a big problem for low-background\nexperiments in underground Laboratories. Our global net of en-detectors\nsensitive to thermal neutrons includes the detectors running both on the\nsurface and at different depths underground. We present here results obtained\nwith the en-detector of 0.75 m^2 which is running more than 3 years in\nunderground room at a depth of 25 m of water equivalent in Skobeltsyn Institute\nof Nuclear Physics, Moscow. Spontaneous increases in thermal neutron flux up to\na factor of 3 were observed in delayed anti-correlation with barometric\npressure. The phenomenon can be explained by a radon barometric pumping effect\nresulting in similar effect in neutron flux produced in (alpha,n)-reactions by\nalpha-decays of radon and its daughters in surrounding rock\n", "  We demonstrate an efficient generation of frequency anti-correlated entangled\nphoton pairs at telecom wavelength. The fundamental laser is a continuous-wave\nhigh-power fiber laser at 1560 nm, through an extracavity frequency doubling\nsystem, a 780-nm pump with a power as high as 742 mW is realized. After single\npassing through a periodically poled KTiOPO4 (PPKTP) crystal, degenerate\ndown-converted photon pairs are generated. With an overall detection efficiency\nof 14.8 %, the count rates of the single photons and coincidence of the photon\npairs are measured to be 370 kHz and 22 kHz, respectively. The spectra of the\nsignal and idler photons are centered at 1560.23 and 1560.04 nm, while their\n3-dB bandwidths being 3.22 nm both. The joint spectrum of the photon pair is\nobserved to be frequency anti correlated and have a spectral bandwidth of 0.52\nnm. According to the ratio of the single photon spectral bandwidth to the joint\nspectral bandwidth of the photon pairs, the degree of frequency entanglement is\nquantified to be 6.19. Based on a Hong Ou Mandel interferometric coincidence\nmeasurement, a frequency indistinguishability of 95 % is demonstrated. The good\nagreements with the theoretical estimations show that the inherent extra\nintensity noise in fiber lasers has little influence on frequency entanglement\nof the generated photon pairs.\n", "  We present a minimal framework of $U(1)_{B-L}$ gauge extension of the\nStandard Model explaining dark matter abundance and matter-antimatter asymmetry\nsimultaneously through an attractive mechanism of TeV scale WIMPy leptogenesis,\ntestable at the current and next generation of colliders. This framework can\nalso explain small neutrino masses via a radiative mechanism. One of the key\npredictions of this model is an enhanced rate for lepton flavor violating decay\n$\\mu \\rightarrow e \\gamma$ within the sensitivity reach of next generation\nexperiments.\n", "  We study the classical XY model in bounded domains of $\\mathbb{Z}^{d}$ with\nDirichlet boundary conditions. We prove that when the temperature goes to zero\nfaster than a certain rate as the lattice spacing goes to zero, the fluctuation\nfield converges to a standard Gaussian white noise. This and related results\nalso apply to a large class of gradient field models.\n", "  We present a photometric study of two new double-mode Cepheids, pulsating in\nthe first and second overtones modes: V470 Cas and GSC 2901-00089. For the\nsearch of the double-mode variability, we used all available observations from\nthe ROTSE-I/NSVS and SuperWASP online public archives. Our multicolour CCD\nobservations in the B, V and R bands in Johnson's system confirm the double\nperiodicity of these variables. We study period variations of the two stars;\nvariations of the first overtone periods were reliably detected. In addition,\nwe consider the Petersen diagram for the Galactic 1O/2O Cepheids.\n", "  Although carbon nanotubes are potential candidates for DNA encapsulation and\nsubsequent delivery of biological payloads to living cells, the thermodynamical\nspontaneity of DNA encapsulation under physiological conditions is still a\nmatter of debate. Using enhanced sampling techniques, we show for the first\ntime that, given a sufficiently large carbon nanotube, the confinement of a\ndouble-stranded DNA segment, 5'-D(*CP*GP*CP*GP*AP*AP*TP*TP*CP*GP*CP*G)-3', is\nthermodynamically favourable under physiological environments (134 mM, 310 K, 1\nbar), leading to DNA-nanotube hybrids with lower free energy than the\nunconfined biomolecule. A diameter threshold of 3 nm is established below which\nencapsulation is inhibited. The confined DNA segment maintains its\ntranslational mobility and exhibits the main geometrical features of the\ncanonical B form. To accommodate itself within the nanopore, the DNA end-to-end\nlength increases from 3.85 nm up to approximately 4.1 nm, due to a 0.3 nm\nelastic expansion of the strand termini. The canonical Watson-Crick H-bond\nnetwork is essentially conserved throughout encapsulation, showing that the\ncontact between the DNA segment and the hydrophobic carbon walls results in\nminor rearrangements of the nucleotides H-bonding. The results obtained here\nare paramount to the usage of carbon nanotubes as encapsulation media for next\ngeneration drug delivery technologies.\n", "  Evidence for a local 'Single Source' of cosmic rays is amassing by way of the\nrecent precise measurements of various cosmic ray energy spectra from the\nAMS-02 instrument. To observations of individual cosmic ray nuclei, electrons,\npositrons and antiprotons must now be added the determination of the\nboron-to-carbon ratio and the energy spectrum of lithium to 2000 GV with high\nprecision. Our analysis leads us to claim that, with certain assumptions about\nthe propagation in the Galaxy, the results confirm our arguments regarding the\npresence of a local single source, perhaps, a supernova remnant (SNR). An\nattempt is made to determine some of the properties of this SNR and its\nprogenitor star.\n", "  We consider how information on geostrophic flows in the planetary cores,\ntaken from 3D simulations in the sphere, can be used in 2D Parker's geodynamo\nmodel with the simple forms of the $\\alpha$-quenching. Using cluster computer\nsystems dependence of dynamo equations solution on the magnitudes of $\\alpha$-\nand $\\omega$-effects is studied. We show that geostrophical flow can produce\nthe well-known Z-structure of the poloidal magnetic field without the feed-back\nof the magnetic field onto the large-scale velocity field. The influence of\nfluctuations of $\\alpha$-effect on magnetic field generation, its spectral\nproperties, in respect to the geodynamo applications, is also discussed.\n", "  Classical and nonclassical states of quantum complex oscillators with real\nspectrum are presented. Such states are bi-orthonormal superpositions of $n+1$\nenergy eigenvectors of the system with binomial-like coefficients. For large\nvalues of $n$ these optimized binomial states behave as photon added coherent\nstates when the imaginary part of the potential is cancelled.\n", "  This dissertation serves as a general introduction to Wigner functions, phase\nspace, and quantum metrology but also strives to be useful as a how-to guide\nfor those who wish to delve into the realm of using continuous variables, to\ndescribe quantum states of light and optical interferometry. We discuss the\nadvantages of Wigner functions and their use to describe many quantum states of\nlight. Throughout our metrology discussions, we will also discuss various\nquantum limits and use quantum Fisher information to show optimal bounds. When\napplicable, we also discuss the use of quantum Gaussian information and how it\nrelates to our Wigner function treatment. The remainder of our discussion\nfocuses on investigating the effects of photon addition and subtraction to\nvarious states of light and analyze the nondeterministic nature of this\nprocess. We use examples of $m$ photon additions to a coherent state as well as\ndiscuss the properties of an $m$ photon subtracted thermal state. We also\nprovide an argument that this process must always be a nondeterministic one, or\nthe ability to violate quantum limits becomes apparent. We show that using\nphase measurement as one's metric is much more restrictive, which limits the\nusefulness of photon addition and subtraction. When we consider SNR however, we\nshow improved SNR statistics, at the cost of increased measurement time. In\nthis case of SNR, we also quantify the efficiency of the photon addition and\nsubtraction process.\n", "  Analytical expressions are derived for the distribution rates of spatial\ncoincidences in the counting of photons produced by spontaneous parametric down\nconversion (SPDC). Gaussian profiles are assumed for the wave function of the\nidler and signal light created in type-I SPDC. The distribution rates describe\nellipses on the detection planes that are oriented at different angles\naccording to the photon coincidences in either horizontal-horizontal,\nvertical-vertical, horizontal-vertical or vertical-horizontal position\nvariables. The predictions are in agreement with the experimental data obtained\nwith a type-I BBO crystal that is illuminated by a 100 mW violet pump laser as\nwell as with the results obtained from the geometry defined by the\nphase-matching conditions.\n", "  We consider a homogeneous stochastic higher spin six vertex model in a\nquadrant. For this model we derive concise integral representations for\nmulti-point q-moments of the height function and for the q-correlation\nfunctions. At least in the case of the step initial condition, our formulas\ndegenerate in appropriate limits to many known formulas of such type for\nintegrable probabilistic systems in the (1+1)d KPZ universality class,\nincluding the stochastic six vertex model, ASEP, various q-TASEPs, and\nassociated zero range processes.\n  Our arguments are largely based on properties of a family of symmetric\nrational functions (introduced in arXiv:1410.0976) that can be defined as\npartition functions of the higher spin six vertex model for suitable domains;\nthey generalize classical Hall-Littlewood and Schur polynomials. A key role is\nplayed by Cauchy-like summation identities for these functions, which are\nobtained as a direct corollary of the Yang-Baxter equation for the higher spin\nsix vertex model.\n  These are lecture notes for a course given by A.B. at the Ecole de Physique\ndes Houches in July of 2015. All the results and proofs presented here\ngeneralize to the setting of the fully inhomogeneous higher spin six vertex\nmodel, see arXiv:1601.05770 for a detailed exposition of the inhomogeneous\ncase.\n", "  The thermodynamics of adsorption of light alkanes and alkenes (CH4, C2H6,\nC2H4, C3H8, and C3H6) in single-walled carbon nanotube bundles is studied by\nconfigurational-bias grand canonical Monte Carlo simulation. The bundles\nconsist of uniform nanotubes with diameters in the range 11.0 < D (A) < 18.1,\narranged in the usual close-packed hexagonal lattice. The phase space is\nsystematically analyzed with calculations for adsorption at room temperature\nand reduced pressure range of 8.7 x 10-9 < (p/p0) < 0.9. The simulation results\nare interpreted in terms of the molecular nature of the adsorbate and the\ncorresponding solid-fluid interactions. It is shown that confinement in the\ninternal volume of the bundle (interstitial and intratubular) is energetically\nmore favorable than physisorption on the external surface (grooves and exposed\nsurfaces of peripheral tubes), as indicated by the curves of isosteric heat as\na function of reduced pressure. However, the zero-loading properties suggest a\ncrossover point to this behavior for D = 18 - 19 A. When interstitial\nconfinement is not inhibited by geometrical considerations, it is possible to\nestablish the following ordering of the zero-loading isosteric heat by type of\nadsorption site.\n", "  We study information theoretic geometry in time dependent quantum mechanical\nsystems. First, we discuss global properties of the parameter manifold for two\nlevel systems exemplified by i) Rabi oscillations and ii) quenching dynamics of\nthe XY spin chain in a transverse magnetic field, when driven across\nanisotropic criticality. Next, we comment upon the nature of the geometric\nphase from classical holonomy analyses of such parameter manifolds. In the\ncontext of the transverse XY model in the thermodynamic limit, our results are\nin contradiction to those in the existing literature, and we argue why the\nissue deserves a more careful analysis. Finally, we speculate on a novel\ngeometric phase in the model, when driven across a quantum critical line.\n", "  The energetic and transport properties of a double-stranded DNA dodecamer\nencapsulated in hydrophobic carbon nanotubes are probed employing two limiting\nnanotube diameters, D=4 nm and D=3 nm, corresponding to (51,0) and (40,0)\nzig-zag topologies, respectively. It is observed that the thermodynamically\nspontaneous encapsulation in the 4 nm nanopore (40 kJ/mol) is annihilated when\nthe solid diameter narrows down to 3 nm, and that the confined DNA termini\ndirectly contact the hydrophobic walls with no solvent slab in-between. During\nthe initial moments after confinement (2-3 ns),the biomolecule translocates\nalong the nano pore's inner volume according to Fick's law (t) with a\nself-diffusion coefficient D=1.713 x 10-9m2/s, after which molecular diffusion\nassumes a single-file type mechanism (t1/2). As expected, diffusion is\nanisotropic, with the pore main axis as the preferred direction, but an\nin-depth analysis shows that the instantaneous velocity probabilities are\nessentially identical along the x, y and z directions. The 3D velocity\nhistogram shows a maximum probability located at v=30.8 m/s, twice the observed\nvelocity for a single-stranded three nucleotide DNA encapsulated in comparable\narmchair geometries (v=16.7 m/s, D=1.36-1.89 nm). Because precise physiological\nconditions (310 K, [NaCl] = 134 mM) are employed throughout, the present study\nestablishes a landmark for the development of next generation in vivo drug\ndelivery technologies based on carbon nanotubes as encapsulation agents.\n", "  Novae are now firmly established as a high-energy (>100 MeV) gamma-ray source\nclass by the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT). In symbiotic binary systems such\nas V407 Cyg 2010, there is a firm theoretical framework for the production of\nshock-accelerated particles in the nova ejecta from interactions with the dense\nwind of the red giant companion. Yet, the high-energy gamma-ray emission\ndetected in classical novae involving less evolved stellar companions cannot be\nexplained in the same way and could instead be produced in internal shocks in\nthe ejecta. We summarize the Fermi-LAT gamma-ray observations of novae,\nhighlighting the main properties that will guide further studies. Additionally,\nwe report on the soft gamma-ray (~0.1 MeV) continuum detection of the\noxygen-neon type classical nova V382 Vel 1999 with the OSSE detector aboard the\nCompton Gamma Ray Observatory in light of its Fermi-era analog, V959 Mon 2012.\n", "  We consider a class of liquid crystal free-boundary problems for which both\nthe equilibrium shape and internal configuration of a system must\nsimultaneously be determined, for example in films with air- or fluid-liquid\ncrystal interfaces and elastomers. We develop a finite element algorithm to\nsolve such problems with dynamic mesh control, achieved by supplementing the\nfree energy with an auxiliary functional that promotes mesh quality and is\nminimized in the null space of the energy. We apply this algorithm to a\nflexible capacitor, as well as to determine the shape of liquid crystal\ntactoids as a function of the surface tension and elastic constants. These are\ncompared with theoretical predictions and experimental observations of tactoids\nfrom the literature.\n", "  Numerical simulations of the flow in an extrusion damper are performed using\na finite volume method. The damper is assumed to consist of a shaft, with or\nwithout a spherical bulge, oscillating axially in a containing cylinder filled\nwith a viscoplastic material of Bingham type. The response of the damper to a\nforced sinusoidal displacement is studied. In the bulgeless case the\nconfiguration is the annular analogue of the well-known lid-driven cavity\nproblem, but with a sinusoidal rather than constant lid velocity. Navier slip\nis applied to the shaft surface in order to bound the reaction force to finite\nvalues. Starting from a base case, several problem parameters are varied in\nturn in order to study the effects of viscoplasticity, slip, damper geometry\nand oscillation frequency to the damper response. The results show that,\ncompared to Newtonian flow, viscoplasticity causes the damper force to be less\nsensitive to the shaft velocity; this is often a desirable damper property. The\nbulge increases the required force on the damper mainly by generating a\npressure difference across itself; the latter is larger the smaller the gap\nbetween the bulge and the casing is. At high yield stresses or slip\ncoefficients the amount of energy dissipation that occurs due to sliding\nfriction at the shaft-fluid interface is seen to increase significantly. At low\nfrequencies the flow is in quasi steady state, dominated by viscoplastic\nforces, while at higher frequencies the fluid kinetic energy storage and\nrelease also come into the energy balance, introducing hysteresis effects.\n", "  Ion anisotropies can affect a host of processes within the magnetosphere,\nfrom modifying the growth rate of various instabilities to the energization and\nmass transport within the magnetosphere. Global multi-fluid simulations using a\nfull treatment of the pressure tensor are used to evaluate the influence of\ntemperature anisotropies on the magnetospheric dynamics for an idealized\nsubstorm. The simulations are able to resolve the development of conics over\nthe polar cap which eventually turn into beams in the lobes. Entry of this\nplasma, particularly heavy ions with high Tparallel, leads to a faster\nreconnection rate, additional turbulence within the reconnection region, and\nthe substorm onset time occurs approximately 5 min earlier relative to\nisotropic simulations. The anisotropic treatment yields much more intense\nauroral currents on the nightside associated with onset and a faster expansion\nphase of the substorm. The plasma entering into the current sheet experiences\nstronger heating in the anisotropic simulations, which increases plasma\ntransport into the equatorial dayside. Hence, the convection of the\nplasmasphere towards the dayside magnetosphere during the growth phase is\naccompanied by a relative increase in Tparallel. This leads to a very distinct\ntemperature profile on the dayside. The injection of the energetic particles\nfrom the substorm leads to an overall increase Tperpendicular on the dayside,\nbut only O+ reaches sufficient energies for the bulk of these ions to be able\nto cross noon local time during the expansion phase to participate in the\nformation of symmetric ring current. The net effect from these processes is to\ndecrease the cross-polar cap potential, modify the timing of the development of\nreconnection and the development of the auroral currents and enhance the\ninjection of energetic particles into the inner magnetosphere.\n", "  For a class of one-dimensional determinantal point processes including those\ninduced by orthogonal projections with integrable kernels satisfying a growth\ncondition, it is proved that their conditional measures, with respect to the\nconfiguration in the complement of a compact interval, are orthogonal\npolynomial ensembles with explicitly found weights. Examples include the\nsine-process and the process with the Bessel kernel. The argument uses the\nquasi-invariance, established in [1], of our point processes under the group of\npiecewise isometries of the real line.\n", "  In this paper in a framework of classical electrodynamics, we re-derived in a\nsimple way the formula for the light scattering by moving particle with\narbitrary angle of collision.\n", "  We present a novel model showing that compound chondrules are formed by\ncollisions of supercooled droplets. This model reproduces two prominent\nobserved features of compound chondrules: the nonporphyritic texture and the\nsize ratio between two components.\n", "  We develop a numerical method for simulating coupled interactions of complex\nfloating structures with large-scale ocean waves and atmospheric turbulence. We\nemploy an efficient large-scale model to develop offshore wind and wave\nenvironmental conditions, which are then incorporated into a high resolution\ntwo-phase flow solver with fluid-structure interaction (FSI). The large-scale\nwind-wave interaction model is based on the two-fluid dynamically-coupled\napproach of Yang and Shen (2011), which employs a high-order spectral method\nfor simulating the water motion and a viscous solver with undulatory boundaries\nfor the air motion. The two-phase flow FSI solver, developed by Calderer, Kang,\nand Sotiropoulos (2014), is based on the level set method and is capable of\nsimulating the coupled dynamic interaction of arbitrarily complex bodies with\nairflow and waves. The large-scale wave field solver is coupled with the\nnear-field FSI solver by feeding into the latter waves via the pressure-forcing\nmethod of Guo and Shen (2009), which has been extended herein for the level set\nmethod. We validate the model for both simple wave trains and three-dimensional\ndirectional waves and compare the results with experimental and theoretical\nsolutions. Finally, we demonstrate the capabilities of the new computational\nframework by carrying out large-eddy simulation of a floating offshore wind\nturbine interacting with realistic ocean wind and waves.\n", "  For understanding the dissipation in a rotating flow when resonance occurs,\nwe study the rotating flow driven by the harmonic force in a periodic box. Both\nthe linear and nonlinear regimes are studied. The various parameters such as\nthe force amplitude $a$, the force frequency $\\omega$, the force wavenumber\n$k$, and the Ekman number $E$ are investigated. In the linear regime, the\ndissipation at the resonant frequency scales as $E^{-1}k^{-2}$, and it is much\nstronger than the dissipation at the non-resonant frequencies on the large\nscales and at the low Ekman numbers. In the nonlinear regime, at the resonant\nfrequency the effective dissipation (dissipation normalised with the square of\nforce amplitude) is lower than in the linear regime and it decreases with the\nincreasing force amplitude. This nonlinear suppression effect is significant\nnear the resonant frequency but negligible far away from the resonant\nfrequency. Opposite to the linear regime, in the nonlinear regime at the\nresonant frequency the lower Ekman number leads to the lower dissipation\nbecause of the stronger nonlinear effect. This work implies that the previous\nlinear calculations overestimated the tidal dissipation, which is important for\nunderstanding the tides in stars and giant planets.\n", "  Many evolving complex systems can be modeled via dynamic networks. An\nimportant problem in dynamic network research is community detection, which\nidentifies groups of topologically related nodes. Typically, this problem is\napproached by assuming either that each time point has a distinct community\norganization or that all time points share one community organization. In\nreality, the truth likely lies between these two extremes, since some time\nperiods can have community organization that evolves while others can have\ncommunity organization that stays the same. To find the compromise, we consider\ncommunity detection in the context of the problem of segment detection, which\nidentifies contiguous time periods with consistent network structure.\nConsequently, we formulate a combined problem of segment community detection\n(SCD), which simultaneously partitions the network into contiguous time\nsegments with consistent community organization and finds this community\norganization for each segment. To solve SCD, we introduce SCOUT, an\noptimization framework that explicitly considers both segmentation quality and\npartition quality. SCOUT addresses limitations of existing methods that can be\nadapted to solve SCD, which typically consider only one of segmentation quality\nor partition quality. In a thorough evaluation, SCOUT outperforms the existing\nmethods in terms of both accuracy and computational complexity.\n", "  In recent years, the striking gender imbalance in the physical sciences has\nbeen a topic for much debate. National bodies and professional societies in the\nastronomical and space sciences are now taking active steps to understand and\naddress this imbalance. In order to begin this process in the Australian Space\nResearch community, we must first understand the current state of play. In this\nwork, we therefore present a short 'snapshot' of the current gender balance in\nour community, as observed at the 15th Australian Space Research Conference.\n  We find that, at this year's conference, male attendees outnumbered female\nattendees by a ratio of 3:1 (24% female). This gender balance was repeated in\nthe distribution of conference talks and plenary presentations (25 and 22%\nfemale, respectively). Of the thirteen posters presented at the conference,\ntwelve were presented by men (92%), a pattern repeated in the awards for the\nbest student presentations (seven male recipients vs one female). The program\nand organising committees for the meeting fairly represented the gender balance\nof the conference attendees (28% and 30% female, respectively). These figures\nprovide a baseline for monitoring future progress in increasing the\nparticipation of women in the field. They also suggest that the real barrier is\nnot speaking, but in enabling conference attendance and retaining female\nscientists through their careers - in other words, addressing and repairing the\n'leaky pipeline'.\n", "  The Daya Bay Reactor Neutrino Experiment discovered an unexpectedly large\nneutrino oscillation related to the mixing angle $\\theta_{13}$ in 2012. This\nfinding paved the way to the next generation of neutrino oscillation\nexperiments. In this article, we review the history, featured design, and\nscientific results of Daya Bay. Prospects of the experiment are also described.\n", "  The dynamical behavior of entanglement between the atomic ensemble and the\nspontaneous emission is investigated by applying the femtosecond Gaussian\npulses in double- lambda quantum system. In fact by solving the density matrix\nequations of motion in such a system and by using the von Neumann entropy, the\ndegree of entanglement (DEM) could be measured in semi classical regime and in\nthe multi-photon resonance condition. We interested in investigating the\nmaximum value for DEM and controlled the DEM via relative phase. At first we\nconsider three laser fields as CW optical laser fields and one femtosecond\nGaussian field. In this case DEM has interesting behavior. When the system is\napplied by the other laser fields and Gaussian pulse is still there DEM can be\ncontrolled via phase but after finishing the time duration of the femtosecond\nGaussian pulse DEM will be phase independent. Then we consider all the laser\nfields as femtosecond Gaussian pulses which interact with atomic system and we\nachieve to this point that the steady state entanglement can be occurred by\nusing such ultra-short laser pulses; in this situation DEM will be phase\nindependent. The system would be disentangled in special parameters of Rabi\nfrequencies and all the atoms are coherently populated in a dark state in\ndressed state picture. Moreover when the system is entangled, there is a\npopulation distribution of the atoms in dressed states.\n", "  Incompressible, homogeneous and isotropic turbulence is studied by solving\nthe Navier-Stokes equations on a reduced set of Fourier modes, belonging to a\nfractal set of dimension $D$. By tuning the fractal dimension parameter, we\nstudy the dynamical effects of Fourier decimation on the vortex stretching\nmechanism and on the statistics of the velocity and the velocity gradient\ntensor. In particular, we show that as we move from $D=3$ to $D \\sim 2.8$, the\nstatistics gradually turns into a purely Gaussian one. This result suggests\nthat even a mild fractal mode reduction strongly depletes the stretching\nproperties of the non-linear term of the Navier-Stokes equations and suppresses\nanomalous fluctuations.\n", "  We present a brief review of the main results of the Planck 2015 release\ndescribing the new calibration of the data, showing the maps delivered in\ntemperature and, for the first time, in polarization, the cosmological\nparameters and the lensing potential. In addition we present a forecast of the\nGalactic foregrounds in polarization. Future satellite experiments will have\nthe challenge to remove the foregrounds with great accuracy to be able to\nmeasure a tensor-to-scalar ratio of less than 0.01.\n", "  In CaFe2As2, superconductivity can be achieved by applying a modest c-axis\npressure of several kbar. Here we use scanning tunneling\nmicroscopy/spectroscopy (STM/S) to explore the STM tip pressure effect on\nsingle crystals of CaFe2As2. When performing STM/S measurements, the tip-sample\ninteraction can be controlled to act repulsive with reduction of the junction\nresistance, thus to apply a tip pressure on the sample. We find that an\nincoherent energy gap emerges at the Fermi level in the differential\nconductance spectrum when the tip pressure is increased. This energy gap is of\nthe similar order of magnitude as the superconducting gap in the chemical doped\ncompound Ca0.4Na0.6Fe2As2 and disappears at the temperature well below that of\nthe bulk magnetic ordering. Moreover, we also observe the rhombic distortion of\nthe As lattice, which agrees with the orthorhombic distortion of the underlying\nFe lattice. These findings suggest that the STM tip pressure can induce the\nlocal Cooper pairing in the orthorhombic phase of CaFe2As2.\n", "  Recently, some reports show that the ultra-low thermal conductivity of bulk\npolymers can be enhanced along one direction, which limits its applications.\nHere, we proposed paved crosswise laminate methods which can enhance the\nthermal conductivity of bulk polyethylene (PE) along two directions. We find\nthat the thermal conductivity of paved crosswise polyethylene laminate (PPEL)\nreaches as high as 181 W/m-K along two in-plane directions, which is three\norders of magnitude larger than bulk amorphous polyethylene and even more than\ntwo times larger than PE single chain (54 W/m-K). The analyses of mechanism\nindicated that PPEL is a much more crystal-like structure due to the\ninter-chain van der Waals interactions. Our study may provide guides on the\ndesign and fabrication of polymer structures with high thermal conductivity.\n", "  It has recently been demonstrated that difference frequency mixing (DFM) can\ngenerate surface plasmons in graphene [1]. Here, we present detailed\ncalculations comparing the contributions to this effect from substrate and from\ngraphene nonlinearities. Our calculations show that the substrate (quartz)\nnonlinearity gives rise to a surface plasmon intensity that is around twelve\norders of magnitude smaller than that arising from the intrinsic graphene\nresponse. This surprisingly efficient intrinsic process, given the\ncentrosymmetric structure of graphene, arises almost entirely due to non-local\ncontributions to the second order optical nonlinearity of graphene.\n", "  The definition of physical states is the main technical issue of canonical\napproaches towards Quantum Gravity. In this work, we outline how those states\ncan be found in Einstein-Cartan theory via a continuum limit and they are given\nby finite dimensional representations of the Lorentz group.\n", "  We take an ordered, anharmonic crystal in the form of slab geometry in three\ndimensions. Apart from attaching baths of Langevin type to the extreme\nsurfaces, we also attach baths of same type to the intermediate surfaces of the\nslab to simulate the environment surrounding the system. We assume noise\nfunctions to be Gaussian and their widths to be site dependent. We find that\nthe radiated heat from the slab does not receive any correction at the leading\norder of anharmonic coupling and the Newton's law of cooling holds for an\nappropriate choice of the widths. We observe that in the steady state limit\nentire slab becomes an assembly of $N$ different thermally equilibriated\nlayers, where $N$ is the number of sites in the direction of conduction current\nflow. We find an exponentially falling nature of the temperature profile as its\nleading behaviour and its non-leading behaviour is governed by the two site\ndependent functions. Our evaluation suggests that in the thermodynamic limit\nthermal conductivity remains independent of the environment temperature and is\ndependent only on the difference of temperature of the extreme surfaces\nlinearly at the leading order of anharmonic coupling. We find that owing to\nfiniteness of conductivity in the thermodynamic limit, Fourier's law holds to\nleading order in anharmonic coupling.\n", "  High-energy muons generated from cosmic-ray particle showers have been shown\nto exhibit properties ideal for imaging the interior of large structures. This\npaper explores the possibility of using a single portable muon detector in\nconjunction with image reconstruction methods used in nuclear medicine to\nreconstruct a 3D image of the interior of critical infrastructure such as the\nZero Energy Deuterium (ZED-2) research reactor at Canadian Nuclear\nLaboratories' Chalk River site. The ZED-2 reactor core and muon detector\narrangement are modeled in GEANT4 and Monte Carlo measurements of the resultant\nmuon throughput and angular distribution at several angles of rotation around\nthe reactor are generated. Statistical analysis is then performed on these\nmeasurements based on the well-defined flux and angular distribution of muons\nexpected near the surface of the earth. The results of this analysis are shown\nto produce reconstructed images of the spatial distribution of nuclear fuel\nwithin the core for multiple fuel configurations. This one-sided tomography\nconcept is a possible candidate for examining the internal structure of larger\ncritical facilities, for example the Fukushima Daiichi power plant where the\nintegrity of the containment infrastructure and the location of the reactor\nfuel is unknown.\n", "  The random walk of a bonded monomer in a polymer melt is anisotropic due to\nlocal order and bond connectivity. We investigate both effects by\nmolecular-dynamics simulations on melts of fully-flexible linear chains ranging\nfrom dimers ($M=2$) up to entangled polymers ($M=200$). The corresponding\natomic liquid is also considered as reference system. To disentangle the\ninfluence of the local geometry and the bond arrangements, and reveal their\ninterplay, we define suitable measures of the anisotropy emphasising either the\nformer or the latter aspect. Connectivity anisotropy, as measured by the\ncorrelation between the initial bond orientation and the direction of the\nsubsequent monomer displacement, shows a slight enhancement due to the local\norder at times shorter than the structural relaxation time. At intermediate\ntimes - when the monomer displacement is comparable to the bond length - a\npronounced peak and then decays slowly as $t^{-1/2}$, becoming negligible when\nthe displacements is as large as about five bond lengths, i.e. about four\nmonomer diameters or three Kuhn lengths. Local-geometry anisotropy, as measured\nby the correlation between the initial orientation of a characteristic axis of\nthe Voronoi cell and the subsequent monomer dynamics, is affected at shorter\ntimes than the structural relaxation time by the cage shape with antagonistic\ndisturbance by the connectivity. Differently, at longer times, the connectivity\nfavours the persistence of the local-geometry anisotropy which vanishes when\nthe monomer displacement exceeds the bond length. Our results strongly suggest\nthat the sole consideration of the local order is not enough to understand the\nmicroscopic origin of the rattling amplitude of the trapped monomer in the cage\nof the neighbours.\n", "  Structural, impedance, ferroelectric and magnetic properties were examined in\nmultiferroic Bi_{2}Fe_{4(1-x)}Co_{4x}O_{9} (0$\\leq$x$\\leq$0.02) ceramics\nsynthesized via solid-state reaction method. X-ray diffraction analysis and\nRietveld refinement showed secondary phase formation (for x$\\geq$0.01) which\nwas subsequently confirmed from room temperature Raman spectroscopy study. The\nfrequency dependence of impedance and electric modulus of the material showed\nthe presence of non-Debye type relaxation in all the samples. The values of the\nactivation energies calculated from imaginary impedance and modulus lie in the\nrange of 0.92-0.99 eV which confirmed that the oxygen vacancies play an\nimportant role in the conduction mechanism. Moreover, suitable amount of Co\nsubstitution significantly enhanced the remnant polarisation (2P_{r}) from\n0.1193 $\\mu$C/cm^{2} (x=0) to 0.2776 $\\mu$C/cm^{2} (x=0.02). Besides, room\ntemperature M-H measurement showed improved ferromagnetic hysteresis loop for\nall the modified samples. The remnant magnetization (M_{r}) and coercive field\n(H_{c}) increased from 0.0007 emu/gm and 42 Oe for x=0 to 0.1401 emu/gm and 296\nOe for x=0.02. The improved ferroelectricity was due to Co 3d-O 2p\nhybridization and enhanced magnetization originated from the partial\nsubstitution of Co^{3+} ions leading to breakdown of balance between the\nanti-parallel sub lattice magnetization of Fe^{3+} ions.\n", "  A new and accurate method to determine the time delay and embedding dimension\nfor state space reconstruction of a high dimensional system from a scalar time\nseries using time delay embedding is presented. The time delay is obtained to\nunprecedented accuracy by evaluating the minima of a newly defined dimension\ndeviation function. The efficacy of our method is tested by applying it to the\nLorenz system and the Mackey-Glass system. A good agreement is obtained between\nthe shape and embedding dimension of the physical system attractor(s) and the\ncorresponding reconstruction(s) for both the systems studied. This, along with\na heuristic argument provide a validation of the proposed method.\n", "  Multiferroic bismuth ferrite Bi_2Fe_4O_9 (BFO) ceramic was synthesized by\nconventional solid state reaction route. X-ray diffraction and Rietveld\nrefinement show formation of single phase ceramic with orthorhombic crystal\nstructure (space group Pbam). The morphological study depicted a well-defined\ngrain of size $\\simeq$2{\\mu}m. The optical studies were carried out by using\nUV-Vis spectrophotometer which shows a band gap of 1.53 eV and a green emission\nspectrum at 537 is observed in the Photoluminescence study. The frequency\ndependent dielectric study at various temperature revealed that the dielectric\nconstant decreases with increase in frequency. A noticeable peak shift towards\nhigher frequency with increasing temperature is observed in the frequency\ndependent dielectric loss plot. The impedance spectroscopy shows a substantial\nshift in imaginary impedance (Z\") peaks toward the high frequency side\ndescribed that the conduction in material favoring the long range motion of\nmobile charge carriers. The presence of non-Debye type multiple relaxations has\nbeen confirmed by complex modulus analysis. The frequency dependent ac\nconductivity at different temperatures indicates that the conduction process is\nthermally activated. The variation of dc conductivity exhibited a negative\ntemperature coefficient of resistance behavior. The activation energy\ncalculated from impedance, modulus and conductivity data confirmed that the\noxygen vacancies play a vital role in the conduction mechanism.\n", "  The two-dimensional silicon allotrope, silicene, could spur the development\nof new and original concepts in Si-based nanotechnology. Up to now silicene can\nonly be epitaxially synthesized on a supporting substrate such as Ag(111). Even\nthough the structural and electronic properties of these epitaxial silicene\nlayers have been intensively studied, very little is known about its\nvibrational characteristics. Here, we present a detailed study of epitaxial\nsilicene on Ag(111) using \\textit{in situ} Raman spectroscopy, which is one of\nthe most extensively employed experimental techniques to characterize 2D\nmaterials, such as graphene, transition metal dichalcogenides, and black\nphosphorous. The vibrational fingerprint of epitaxial silicene, in contrast to\nall previous interpretations, is characterized by three distinct phonon modes\nwith A and E symmetries. The temperature dependent spectral evolution of these\nmodes demonstrates unique thermal properties of epitaxial silicene and a\nsignificant electron-phonon coupling. These results unambiguously support the\npurely two-dimensional character of epitaxial silicene up to about\n$300^{\\circ}C$, whereupon a 2D-to-3D phase transition takes place.\n", "  Decompositing of $N+1$-dimensional gradient operator in terms of Gaussian\nnormal coordinates $(\\xi^{0},\\xi^{\\mu})$, ($\\mu=1,2,3,...,N$) and making the\ncanonical momentum $P_{0}$ along the normal direction $\\mathbf{n}$ to be\nhermitian, we obtain $\\mathbf{n}P_{0}=-i\\hbar\\left( \\mathbf{n}\\partial\n_{0}-\\mathbf{M}_{0}\\right) $ with $\\mathbf{M}_{0}$ denoting the mean curvature\nvector on the surface $\\xi^{0}=const.$ The remaining part of the momentum\noperator lies on the surface, which is identical to the geometric one.\n", "  The discovery of strong topological insulators led to enormous activity in\ncondensed matter physics and the discovery of new types of topological\nmaterials. Bisumth based chalcogenides are exemplary strong three dimensional\ntopological insulators that host an odd number of massless Dirac fermionic\nstates on all surfaces. A departure from this notion is the idea of a weak\ntopological insulator, wherein only certain surface terminations host surface\nstates characterized by an even number of Dirac cones leading to exciting new\nphysics. Experimentally however, weak topological insulators have proven to be\nelusive. Here, we report a discovery of a weak topological insulator (WTI),\nBiSe, of the Bi-chalcogenide family with an indirect band gap of 42 meV. Its\nstructural unit consists of bismuth bilayer (Bi$_2$), a known quantum spin hall\ninsulator sandwiched between two units of Bi$_2$Se$_3$ which are three\ndimensional strong topological insulators. Angle resolved photo-emission\nspectroscopy (ARPES) measurements on cleaved single crystal flakes along with\ndensity fucntional theory (DFT) calculations confirm the existence of weak\ntopological insulating state of BiSe. Additionally, we have carried out\nmagneto-transport measurements on single crystal flakes as well as thin films\nof BiSe, which exhibit clear signatures of weak anti-localization at low\ntemperatures, consistent with the properties of topological insulators.\n", "  Longitudinally hollow bunches provide one means to mitigate the impact of\ntransverse space charge. The hollow distributions are created via dipolar\nparametric excitation during acceleration in CERN's Proton Synchrotron Booster.\nWe present simulation work and beam measurements. Particular emphasis is given\nto the alleviation of space charge effects on the long injection plateau of the\ndownstream Proton Synchrotron machine, which is the main goal of this study.\n", "  In this work, we present a method for absolute measurement of air\nfluorescence yield based on high resolution optical emission spectroscopy. The\nabsolute measurement of the air fluorescence yield is feasible using the\nCherenkov light, emitted by an electron beam simultaneously with the\nfluorescence light, as a \"standard candle\". The separation of these two\nradiations can be accomplished exploiting the \"dark\" spectral regions of the\nemission band systems of the molecular spectrum of nitrogen. In these \"dark\"\nregions the net Cherenkov light can be recorded experimentally and be compared\nwith the calculated one. The instrumentation for obtaining the nitrogen\nmolecular spectra in high resolution and the noninvasive method for monitoring\nthe rotational temperature of the emission process are also described. For the\nexperimental evaluation of the molecular spectra analysis we used DC normal\nglow discharges in air performed in an appropriate spectral lamp considered as\nan air-fluorescence light emulator. The proposed method and the associated\ninstrumentation could be tested and used in thin or thick target experiments in\nelectron beam accelerators as a candidate optical system for this purpose.\n", "  As limits improve on the neutrino mixing angles and mass-squared differences,\nthe focus of T2K has shifted towards studying antineutrino oscillation. This\nwill give an insight into CP violation (if P($\\bar{\\nu}_{\\mu} \\rightarrow\n\\bar{\\nu}_{e}) \\neq \\mbox{P}(\\nu_{\\mu} \\rightarrow \\nu_e)$) and CPT violation\n(if P($\\bar{\\nu}_{\\mu} \\rightarrow \\bar{\\nu}_{\\mu}) \\neq \\mbox{P}(\\nu_{\\mu}\n\\rightarrow \\nu_{\\mu})$) in the lepton sector. This poster summarises the most\nrecent T2K antineutrino oscillation results, from data collected using a\n$\\bar{\\nu}_{\\mu}$-enhanced neutrino beam corresponding to $4.01 \\times 10^{20}$\nprotons on target (roughly $1/3$ of the total protons on target collected by\nT2K). We present world-leading measurements of $\\Delta \\bar{m}^2_{32}$ and\n$\\sin^2\\bar{\\theta}_{23}$ and the first analysis of $\\bar{\\nu}_e$ appearance\nfrom T2K. Both results use a Bayesian oscillation analysis based on a Markov\nChain Monte Carlo method in which data from the near detector and far detector\nare fit simultaneously.\n", "  Motivated by the powerful capability of measurement for the $b$-flavored\nhadron rare decays at LHC and SuperKEKB/Belle-II, the nonleptonic\n$\\bar{B}^{\\ast}$ ${\\to}$ $D\\bar{D}^{\\ast}$, $D{\\rho^-}$, $DK^{\\ast-}$,\n${\\pi}D^{\\ast}$ and $KD^{\\ast}$ weak decays are studied in detail. With the\namplitudes calculated with factorization approach and the form factors of\n$B^{\\ast}$ transition into pseudoscalar meson evaluated with the BSW model,\nbranching fractions and polarization fractions are firstly presented.\nNumerically, the CKM-favored $\\bar{B}_{q}^{\\ast}$ ${\\to}$\n$D_{q}D_{s}^{{\\ast}-}$ and $D_{q}{\\rho}^{-}$ decays have large branching\nfractions, $\\sim$ $10^{-8}$, which should be sought for with priority and\nfirstly observed by LHC and Belle-II experiments. The $\\bar{B}^{\\ast}_q$\n${\\to}$ $D_qK^{\\ast}$ and $D_q{\\rho}$ decays are dominated by the longitudinal\npolarization states. While, the parallel polarization fractions of\n$\\bar{B}^{\\ast}_q$ ${\\to}$ $D_q\\bar{D}^{\\ast}$ decays are comparable with the\nlongitudinal ones, numerically, $f_{\\parallel}$ $+$ $f_{L}$ ${\\simeq}$ 95\\% and\n$f_{L}:f_{\\parallel}$ $\\simeq$ $5:4$. Some comparisons between $\\bar{B}^{*0}_q$\n$\\to$ $D_q V$ and their corresponding $\\bar{B}^{0}_q$ $\\to$ $D^*_q V$ decays\nare performed, and the relation $ f_{L,\\parallel}(\\bar{B}^{\\ast 0}\\to D\nV)\\simeq f_{L,\\parallel}(\\bar{B}^0\\to D^{\\ast +} V^-) $ is presented. Besides,\nwith the implication of $SU(3)$ flavor symmetry, some useful ratios $ R_{\\rm\ndu}$ and $ R_{\\rm ds}$ are discussed in detail, and suggested to be verified\nexperimentally.\n", "  Motivated by the experiments of heavy flavor physics at running LHC and\nupgrading SuperKEKB/Belle-II in the future, the nonleptonic $B^{\\ast}_{(s)}\\to\nM_1 M_2$ $(M=D$, $D_s$, $\\pi$, $K)$ weak decays are studied in this paper. The\namplitudes are calculated with factorization approach, and the transition form\nfactors $A_0^{B^{\\ast}_{(s)}\\to M_1}(0)$ are evaluated within BSW model. With\nthe reasonable approximation $\\Gamma_{tot}(B^*_{(s)})\\simeq \\Gamma(B^*_{(s)}\\to\nB_{(s)}\\gamma)$, our predictions of branching fractions are presented.\nNumerically, the CKM-favored tree-dominated $\\bar{B}^{*0} \\to D^+D^-_s$ and\n$\\bar{B}^{*0}_s \\to D^+_sD^-_s$ decays have the largest branching fractions of\nthe order $\\sim{\\cal O}(10^{-8})$, and hence will be firstly observed by\nforthcoming Belle-II experiment. However, most of the other decay modes have\nthe branching fractions~$<{\\cal O}(10^{-9})$ and thus are hardly to be observed\nsoon. Besides, for the possible detectable $B^{\\ast}_{(s)}$ decays with\nbranching fractions $\\gtrsim{\\cal O}(10^{-9})$, some useful ratios, such as\n$R_D$ {\\it et al.,} are presented and discussed in detail.\n", "  The problem of time in the quantization of gravity arises from the fact that\ntime in Schroedinger's equation is a parameter. This sets time apart from the\nspatial coordinates, represented by operators in quantum mechanics (QM). Thus\n\"time\" in QM and \"time\" in General Relativity (GR) are seen as mutually\nincompatible notions. The introduction of a dy- namical time operator in\nrelativistic quantum mechanics (RQM), that in the Heisenberg representation is\nalso a function of the parameter t (iden- tifed as the laboratory time),\nprompts to examine whether it can help to solve the disfunction referred to\nabove. In particular, its application to the conditional interpretation of the\ncanonical quantization approach toquantum gravity is developed. 1\n", "  The mass function of neutron stars (NSs) contains information about the late\nevolution of massive stars, the supernova explosion mechanism, and the\nequation-of-state of cold, nuclear matter beyond the nuclear saturation\ndensity. A number of recent NS mass measurements in binary millisecond pulsar\n(MSP) systems increase the fraction of massive NSs (with $M > 1.8$ M$_{\\odot}$)\nto $\\sim 20\\% $ of the observed population. In light of these results, we\nemploy a Bayesian framework to revisit the MSP mass distribution. We find that\na single Gaussian model does not sufficiently describe the observed population.\nWe test alternative empirical models and infer that the MSP mass distribution\nis strongly asymmetric. The diversity in spin and orbital properties of\nhigh-mass NSs suggests that this is most likely not a result of the recycling\nprocess, but rather reflects differences in the NS birth masses. The asymmetry\nis best accounted for by a bimodal distribution with a low mass component\ncentred at $1.393_{-0.029}^{+0.031}$ M$_{\\odot}$ and dispersed by\n$0.064_{-0.025}^{+0.064}$ M$_{\\odot}$, and a high-mass component with a mean of\n$1.807_{-0.132}^{+0.081}$ and a dispersion of $0.177_{-0.072}^{+0.115}$\nM$_{\\odot}$. We also establish a lower limit of $M_{max} \\ge 2.018$ M$_{\\odot}$\nat 98% C.L. for the maximum NS mass, from the absence of a high-mass truncation\nin the observed masses. Using our inferred model, we find that the measurement\nof 350 MSP masses, expected after the conclusion of pulsar surveys with the\nSquare-Kilometre Array, can result in a precise localization of a maximum mass\nup to 2.15 M$_{\\odot}$, with a 5% accuracy. Finally, we identify possible\nmassive NSs within the known pulsar population and discuss birth masses of\nMSPs.\n", "  Cross-flow turbines, also known as vertical-axis turbines, have numerous\nfeatures that make them attractive for wind and marine renewable energy. To\nmaximize power output, the turbine blade kinematics may be controlled during\nthe course of the blade revolution, thus optimizing the unsteady fluid dynamic\nforces. Dynamically pitching the blades, similar to blade control in a\nhelicopter, is an established method. However, this technique adds undesirable\nmechanical complexity to the turbine, increasing cost and reducing durability.\nHere we introduce a novel alternative requiring no additional moving parts: we\noptimize the turbine rotation rate as a function of blade position resulting in\nmotion (including changes in the effective angle of attack) that is precisely\ntimed to exploit unsteady fluid effects. We demonstrate experimentally that\nthis approach results in a 79% increase in power output over industry standard\ncontrol methods. Analysis of the fluid forcing and blade kinematics show that\nmaximal power is achieved through alignment of fluid force and rotation rate\nextrema. In addition, the optimized controller excites a well-timed dynamic\nstall vortex, as is found in many examples of biological propulsion. This\ncontrol strategy allows a structurally robust turbine operating at relatively\nlow angular velocity to achieve high efficiency and could enable a new\ngeneration of environmentally-benign turbines for wind and water current power\ngeneration.\n", "  The breakdown behaviour of SiPMs (Silicon PhotoMultiplier) with pixel sizes\nof 15$\\times $15, 25$\\times $25, 50$\\times $50, and 100$\\times $100 $\\mu\n$m$^2$, manufactured by KETEK, has been investigated. From the current-voltage\ncharacteristics measured with and without illumination by LED light of 470 nm\nwavelength, the current-breakdown voltage, $V_I$, and from linear fits of the\nvoltage dependence of the SiPM gain, measured by recording pulse-area spectra,\nthe gain-breakdown voltage, $V_G$, have been obtained. The voltage dependence\nof the Geiger-breakdown probability was determined from the fraction of zero\nphotoelectron events with LED illumination. By comparing the results to a model\ncalculation, the photodetection-breakdown voltage, $V_{PD}$, has been\ndetermined. Within experimental uncertainties, $V_I$ and $V_{PD}$ are equal and\nindependent of pixel size. For $V_G$, a dependence on pixel size is observed.\nThe difference $V_I - V_G$ is about 1 V for the SiPM with 15 $\\mu $m pixels,\ndecreases with pixel size and is compatible with zero for the SiPM with 100\n$\\mu $m pixels.\n", "  In the context of nonrelativistic quantum mechanics, Gaussian wavepacket\nsolutions of the time-dependent Schr\\\"odinger equation provide useful physical\ninsight. This is not the case for relativistic quantum mechanics, however, for\nwhich both the Klein-Gordon and Dirac wave equations result in strange and\ncounterintuitive wavepacket behaviors, even for free-particle Gaussians. These\nbehaviors include zitterbewegung and other interference effects. As a potential\nremedy, this paper explores a new trajectory-based formulation of quantum\nmechanics, in which the wavefunction plays no role [Phys. Rev. X, 4, 040002\n(2014)]. Quantum states are represented as ensembles of trajectories, whose\nmutual interaction is the source of all quantum effects observed in\nnature---suggesting a \"many interacting worlds\" interpretation. It is shown\nthat the relativistic generalization of the trajectory-based formulation\nresults in well-behaved free-particle Gaussian wavepacket solutions. In\nparticular, probability density is positive and well-localized everywhere, and\nits spatial integral is conserved over time---in any inertial frame. Finally,\nthe ensemble-averaged wavepacket motion is along a straight line path through\nspacetime. In this manner, the pathologies of the wave-based relativistic\nquantum theory, as applied to wavepacket propagation, are avoided.\n", "  Kondo insulator FeSb$_2$ with large Seebeck coefficient would have potential\nin thermoelectric applications in cryogenic temperature range if it had not\nbeen for large thermal conductivity $\\kappa$. Here we studied the influence of\ndifferent chemical substitutions at Fe and Sb site on thermal conductivity and\nthermoelectric effect in high quality single crystals. At $5\\%$ of Te doping at\nSb site thermal conductivity is suppressed from $\\sim 250$ W/Km in undoped\nsample to about 8 W/Km. However, Cr and Co doping at Fe site suppresses thermal\nconductivity more slowly than Te doping, and even at 20$\\%$ Cr/Co doping the\nthermal conductivity remains $\\sim 30$ W/Km. The analysis of different\ncontributions to phonon scattering indicates that the giant suppression of\n$\\kappa$ with Te is due to the enhanced point defect scattering originating\nfrom the strain field fluctuations. In contrast, Te-doping has small influence\non the correlation effects and then for small Te substitution the large\nmagnitude of the Seebeck coefficient is still preserved, leading to the\nenhanced thermoelectric figure of merit ($ZT\\sim 0.05$ at $\\sim 100$ K) in\nFe(Sb$_{0.9}$Te$_{0.1}$)$_2$.\n", "  We study numerically the effect of sequence heterogeneity on the\nthermodynamic properties of a Poland-Scheraga model for DNA denaturation taking\ninto account self-avoidance, i.e. with exponent c_p=2.15 for the loop length\nprobability distribution. In complement to previous on-lattice Monte Carlo like\nstudies, we consider here off-lattice numerical calculations for large sequence\nlengths, relying on efficient algorithmic methods. We investigate finite size\neffects with the definition of an appropriate intrinsic length scale x,\ndepending on the parameters of the model. Based on the occurrence of large\nenough rare regions, for a given sequence length N, this study provides a\nqualitative picture for the finite size behavior, suggesting that the effect of\ndisorder could be sensed only with sequence lengths diverging exponentially\nwith x. We further look in detail at average quantities for the particular case\nx=1.3, ensuring through this parameter choice the correspondence between the\noff-lattice and the on-lattice studies. Taken together, the various results can\nbe cast in a coherent picture with a crossover between a nearly pure system\nlike behavior for small sizes N < 1000, as observed in the on-lattice\nsimulations, and the apparent asymptotic behavior indicative of disorder\nrelevance, with an (average) correlation length exponent \\nu_r >= 2/d (=2).\n", "  A model of precursor manifestation mechanisms, stimulated by tectonic\nactivity and some peculiarities of observer strategy, whose main task is the\neffective measurement of precursors in the spatial area of their occurrence on\nthe Earth's daylight, are considered. In particular, the applicability of\nDobrovolsky's approximation is analyzed, when an unperturbed medium\n(characterized by the simple shear state) and the area of tectonic activity\n(local inhomogeneity caused by the change only of shear modulus) are linearly\nelastic, and perturbation, in particular, surface displacement is calculated as\na difference of the solutions of two independent static problems of the theory\nof elasticity with the same boundary condition on the surface. Within the\nframework of this approximation a formula for the spatial distribution (of\nfirst component) of magnetic field variations caused by piezomagnetic effect in\nthe case of perturbed regular medium, which is in simple shear state is\nderived. Cogent arguments in favor of linear dependence between the radon\nspatial distribution and conditional deformation are obtained.\n  Changes in magnetic field strength and radon concentrations were measured\nalong a tectonomagnetic profile of the total length of 11 km in the\nsurroundings of the \"Academician Vernadsky\" Station on the Antarctic Peninsula\n(W 64{\\deg}16', S 65{\\deg}15'). Results showed a positive correlation between\nthe annual surface radon concentration and annual changes of magnetic field\nrelative to a base point, and also the good coincidence with theoretical\ncalculation.\n"]}
