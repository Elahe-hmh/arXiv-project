This\nrepresents a complete theoretical solution to the Phase Retrieval Problem for\ncharacteristic functions of convex bodies. The approach is via the closely\nrelated problem of reconstructing K from noisy measurements of its covariogram,\nthe function giving the volume of the intersection of K with its translates. In\nthe many known situations in which the covariogram determines a convex body, up\nto reflection in the origin and when the position of the body is fixed, our\nalgorithms use O(k^n) noisy covariogram measurements to construct a convex\npolytope P_k that approximates K or its reflection -K in the origin. (By recent\nuniqueness results, this applies to all planar convex bodies, all\nthree-dimensional convex polytopes, and all symmetric and most (in the sense of\nBaire category) arbitrary convex bodies in all dimensions.) Two methods are\nprovided, and both are shown to be strongly consistent, in the sense that,\nalmost surely, the minimum of the Hausdorff distance between P_k and K or -K\ntends to zero as k tends to infinity.\n", "  We consider a model of active Brownian particles with velocity-alignment in\ntwo spatial dimensions with passive and active fluctuations. Hereby, active\nfluctuations refers to purely non-equilibrium stochastic forces correlated with\nthe heading of an individual active particle. In the simplest case studied\nhere, they are assumed as independent stochastic forces parallel (speed noise)\nand perpendicular (angular noise) to the velocity of the particle. On the other\nhand, passive fluctuations are defined by a noise vector independent of the\ndirection of motion of a particle, and may account for example for thermal\nfluctuations.\n  We derive a macroscopic description of the active Brownian particle gas with\nvelocity-alignment interaction. Hereby, we start from the individual based\ndescription in terms of stochastic differential equations (Langevin equations)\nand derive equations of motion for the coarse grained kinetic variables\n(density, velocity and temperature) via a moment expansion of the corresponding\nprobability density function.\n  We focus here in particular on the different impact of active and passive\nfluctuations on the onset of collective motion and show how active fluctuations\nin the active Brownian dynamics can change the phase-transition behaviour of\nthe system. In particular, we show that active angular fluctuation lead to an\nearlier breakdown of collective motion and to emergence of a new bistable\nregime in the mean-field case.\n", "  In this work we derive and analyze coarse-grained descriptions of\nself-propelled particles with selective attraction-repulsion interaction, where\nindividuals may respond differently to their neighbours depending on their\nrelative state of motion (approach versus movement away). Based on the\nformulation of a nonlinear Fokker-Planck equation, we derive a kinetic\ndescription of the system dynamics in terms of equations for the Fourier modes\nof a one-particle density function. This approach allows effective numerical\ninvestigation of the stability of possible solutions of the system. The\ndetailed analysis of the interaction integrals entering the equations\ndemonstrates that divergences at small wavelengths can appear at arbitrary\nexpansion orders.\n  Further on, we also derive a hydrodynamic theory by performing a closure at\nthe level of the second Fourier mode of the one-particle density function. We\nshow that the general form of equations is in agreement with the theory\nformulated by Toner and Tu.\n  Finally, we compare our analytical predictions on the stability of the\ndisordered homogeneous solution with results of individual-based simulations.\nThey show good agreement for sufficiently large densities and non-negligible\nshort-ranged repulsion. Disagreements of numerical results and the hydrodynamic\ntheory for weak short-ranged repulsion reveal the existence of a previously\nunknown phase of the model consisting of dense, nematically aligned filaments,\nwhich cannot be accounted for by the present Toner and Tu type theory of polar\nactive matter.\n", "  Toeplitz quantization is defined in a general setting in which the symbols\nare the elements of a possibly non-commutative algebra with a conjugation and a\npossibly degenerate inner product. We show that the quantum group $SU_q(2)$ is\nsuch an algebra. Unlike many quantization schemes, this Toeplitz quantization\ndoes not require a measure. The theory is based on the mathematical structures\ndefined and studied in several recent papers of the author; those papers dealt\nwith some specific examples of this new Toeplitz quantization. Annihilation and\ncreation operators are defined as densely defined Toeplitz operators acting in\na quantum Hilbert space, and their commutation relations are discussed. At this\npoint Planck's constant is introduced into the theory. Due to the possibility\nof non-commuting symbols, there are now two definitions for anti-Wick\nquantization; these two definitions are equivalent in the commutative case. The\nToeplitz quantization introduced here satisfies one of these definitions, but\nnot necessarily the other. This theory should be considered as a second\nquantization, since it quantizes non-commutative (that is, already quantum)\nobjects. The quantization theory presented here has two essential features of a\nphysically useful quantization: Planck's constant and a Hilbert space where\nnatural, densely defined operators act.\n", "  As a topic of \"quantum color dynamics\", we study various mass generation of\ncolored particles and gluonic dressing effect in a non-perturbative manner,\nusing the Schwinger-Dyson (SD) formalism in (scalar) QCD. First, we review\ndynamical quark-mass generation in QCD in the SD approach as a typical\nfermion-mass generation via spontaneous chiral-symmetry breaking. Second, using\nthe SD formalism for scalar QCD, we investigate the scalar diquark, a\nbound-state-like object of two quarks, and its mass generation, which is\nclearly non-chiral-origin. Here, the scalar diquark is treated as an extended\ncolored scalar field, like a meson in effective hadron models, and its\neffective size $R$ is introduced as a form factor. As a diagrammatical\ndifference, the SD equation for the scalar diquark has an additional 4-point\ninteraction term, in comparison with the single quark case. The diquark size\n$R$ is taken to be smaller than a hadron, $R\\sim 1$ fm, and larger than a\nconstituent quark, $R\\sim 0.3$ fm. We find that the compact diquark with\n$R\\simeq 0.3$ fm has a large effective mass of about 900 MeV, and therefore\nsuch a compact diquark is not acceptable in effective models for hadrons. We\nalso consider the artificial removal of 3- and 4-point interaction,\nrespectively, to see the role of each term, and find that the 4-point\ninteraction plays the dominant role of the diquark self-energy. From the above\ntwo different cases, quarks and diquarks, we guess that the mass generation of\ncolored particles is a general result of non-perturbative gluonic dressing\neffect.\n", "  Unlike bosons, fermions always have a non-trivial entanglement. Intuitively,\nSlater determinantal states should be the least entangled states. To make this\nintuition precise we investigate entropy and entanglement of fermionic states\nand prove some extremal and near extremal properties of reduced density\nmatrices of Slater determinantal states.\n", "  Inspired by the Turing mechanism for pattern formation, we propose a simple\nself-propelled particle model with short-ranged alignment and anti-alignment at\nlarger distances. It is able to produce orientationally ordered states,\nperiodic vortex patterns as well as meso-scale turbulence. The latter phase\nresembles observations in dense bacterial suspensions. The model allows a\nsystematic derivation and analysis of a kinetic theory as well as hydrodynamic\nequations for density and momentum fields. A phase diagram with regions of such\npattern formation as well as spatially homogeneous orientational order and\ndisorder is obtained from a linear stability analysis of these continuum\nequations. Microscopic Langevin simulations of the self-propelled particle\nsystem are in agreement with these findings.\n", "  Instanton-dyons, also known as instanton-monopoles or instanton-quarks, are\ntopological constituents of the instantons at nonzero temperature and nonzero\nexpectation value of $A_4$. While the interaction between instanton-dyons has\nbeen calculated to one-loop order by a number of authors, that for\ndyon-antidyon pairs remains unknown even at the classical level. In this work\nwe are filling this gap, by solving the gradient flow equation on a 3d lattice.\nWe start with two well separated objects. We find that, after initial rapid\nrelaxation, the configurations follow \"streamline\" set of configurations, which\nis basically independent on the initial configurations used. In striking\ndifference to instanton-antiinstanton streamlines, in this case it ends at a\nquasi-stationary configuration, with an abrupt drop to perturbative fields. We\nparameterize the action of the streamline configurations, which is to be used\nin future many-body calculations.\n", "  We show that if m is a probability measure with infinite support on the unit\ncircle having no singular component and a differentiable weight, then the\ncorresponding paraorthogonal polynomial P_n(z;B) solves an explicit second\norder linear differential equation. We also show that if T and B are distinct,\nthen the pair {P_n(z;B),P_n(z;T)} solves an explicit first order linear system\nof differential equations. One can use these differential equations to deduce\nthat the zeros of every paraorthogonal polynomial mark the locations of a set\nof particles that are in electrostatic equilibrium with respect to a particular\nexternal field.\n", "  The geometry of optical lattices can be engineered allowing the study of\natomic transport along paths arranged in patterns that are otherwise difficult\nto probe in the solid state. A question readily accessible to atomic systems is\nrelated to the speed of propagation of matter-waves as a function of the\nlattice geometry. To address this issue, we have investigated theoretically the\nquantum transport of non-interacting and weakly-interacting ultracold fermionic\natoms in several 2D optical lattice geometries. We find that the triangular\nlattice has a higher propagation velocity compared to the square lattice,\ndespite supporting longer paths. The body-centered square lattice has even\nlonger paths, nonetheless the propagation velocity is yet faster. This apparent\nparadox arises from the mixing of the momentum states which leads to different\ngroup velocities in quantum systems. Standard band theory provides an\nexplanation and allows for a systematic way to search and design systems with\ncontrollable matter-wave propagation. Moreover, the presence of a flat band\nsuch as in a two-leg ladder geometry leads to a dynamical density\ndiscontinuity, which contrasts the behavior of mobile and localized atoms in\nquantum transport. Our predictions are realizable with present experimental\ncapability.\n", "  It is shown that a consistent application of Bayesian updating from a prior\nprobability density to a posterior using evidence in the form of expectation\nconstraints leads to exactly the same results as the application of the maximum\nentropy principle, namely a posterior belonging to the exponential family. The\nBayesian updating procedure presented in this work is not expressed as a\nvariational principle, and does not involve the concept of entropy. Therefore\nit conceptually constitutes a complete alternative to entropic methods of\ninference.\n", "  Interactions between a supermassive black hole binary and the surrounding\naccretion disc can both assist the binary inspiral and align the black hole\nspins to the disc angular momentum. While binary migration is due to\nangular-momentum transfer within the circumbinary disc, the spin-alignment\nprocess is driven by the mass accreting on to each black hole. Mass transfer\nbetween different disc components thus couples the inspiral and the alignment\nprocess together. Mass is expected to leak through the cavity cleared by the\nbinary, and preferentially accretes on to the lighter (secondary) black hole\nwhich orbits closer to the disc edge. Low accretion rate on to the heavier\n(primary) black hole slows the alignment process down. We revisit the problem\nand develop a semi-analytical model to describe the coupling between gas-driven\ninspiral and spin alignment, finding that binaries with mass ratio q<~0.2\napproach the gravitational-wave driven inspiral in differential misalignment:\nlight secondaries prevent primaries from aligning. Binary black holes with\nmisaligned primaries are ideal candidates for precession effects in the\nstrong-gravity regime and may suffer from moderately large (~1500 km/s) recoil\nvelocities.\n", "  Supersymmetric quantum mechanics is a powerful tool for generating exactly\nsolvable potentials departing from a given initial one. In this article the\nfirst- and second- order supersymmetric transformations will be used to obtain\nnew exactly solvable potentials departing from the complex oscillator. The\ncorresponding Hamiltonians turn out to be ruled by polynomial Heisenberg\nalgebras. By applying a mechanism to reduce to second the order of these\nalgebras, the connection with the Painlev\\'{e} IV equation is achieved, thus\ngiving place to new solutions for the Painlev\\'{e} IV equation.\n", "  The overwhelming success of online social networks, the key actors in the Web\n2.0 cosmos, has reshaped human interactions globally. To help understand the\nfundamental mechanisms which determine the fate of online social networks at\nthe system level, we describe the digital world as a complex ecosystem of\ninteracting networks. In this paper, we study the impact of heterogeneity in\nnetwork fitnesses on the competition between an international network, such as\nFacebook, and local services. The higher fitness of international networks is\ninduced by their ability to attract users from all over the world, which can\nthen establish social interactions without the limitations of local networks.\nIn other words, inter-country social ties lead to increased fitness of the\ninternational network. To study the competition between an international\nnetwork and local ones, we construct a 1:1000 scale model of the digital world,\nconsisting of the 80 countries with the most Internet users. Under certain\nconditions, this leads to the extinction of local networks; whereas under\ndifferent conditions, local networks can persist and even dominate completely.\nIn particular, our model suggests that, with the parameters that best reproduce\nthe empirical overtake of Facebook, this overtake could have not taken place\nwith a significant probability.\n", "  Recently, we proposed a self-propelled particle model with competing\nalignment interactions: nearby particles tend to align their velocities whereas\nthey anti-align their direction of motion with particles which are further away\n[R. Grossmann et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 113, 258104 (2014)]. Here, we extend our\nprevious numerical analysis of the high density regime considering low particle\ndensities too. We report on the emergence of various macroscopic patterns such\nas vortex arrays, mesoscale turbulence as well as the formation of polar\nclusters, polar bands and nematically ordered states. Furthermore, we study\nanalytically the instabilities leading to pattern formation in mean-field\napproximation. We argue that these instabilities are well described by a\nreduced set of hydrodynamic equations in the limit of high density.\n", "  The Euclidean formulation of SU(2) Yang-Mills thermodynamics admits periodic,\n(anti)selfdual solutions to the fundamental, classical equation of motion which\npossess one unit of topological charge: (anti)calorons. A spatial coarse\ngraining over the central region in a pair of such localised field\nconfigurations with trivial holonomy generates an inert adjoint scalar field\n$\\phi$, effectively describing the pure quantum part of the thermal ground\nstate in the induced quantum field theory. Here we show for the limit of zero\nholonomy how (anti)calorons associate a temperature independent electric\npermittivity and magnetic permeability to the thermal ground state of\nSU(2)$_{\\tiny\\mbox{CMB}}$, the Yang-Mills theory conjectured to underlie photon\npropagation.\n", "  Gravitational theories with multiple scalar fields coupled to the metric and\neach other --- a natural extension of the well studied single-scalar-tensor\ntheories --- are interesting phenomenological frameworks to describe deviations\nfrom general relativity in the strong-field regime. In these theories, the\n$N$-tuple of scalar fields takes values in a coordinate patch of an\n$N$-dimensional Riemannian target-space manifold whose properties are poorly\nconstrained by weak-field observations. Here we introduce for simplicity a\nnon-trivial model with two scalar fields and a maximally symmetric target-space\nmanifold. Within this model we present a preliminary investigation of\nspontaneous scalarization for relativistic, perfect fluid stellar models in\nspherical symmetry. We find that the scalarization threshold is determined by\nthe eigenvalues of a symmetric scalar-matter coupling matrix, and that the\nproperties of strongly scalarized stellar configurations additionally depend on\nthe target-space curvature radius. In preparation for numerical relativity\nsimulations, we also write down the $3+1$ decomposition of the field equations\nfor generic tensor-multi-scalar theories.\n", "  Surfaces and interfaces offer new possibilities for tailoring the many-body\ninteractions that dominate the electrical and thermal properties of transition\nmetal oxides. Here, we use the prototypical two-dimensional electron liquid\n(2DEL) at the SrTiO$_3$(001) surface to reveal a remarkably complex evolution\nof electron-phonon coupling with the tunable carrier density of this system. At\nlow density, where superconductivity is found in the analogous 2DEL at the\nLaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ interface, our angle-resolved photoemission data show\nreplica bands separated by 100\\,meV from the main bands. This is a hallmark of\na coherent polaronic liquid and implies strong long-range coupling to a single\nlongitudinal optical phonon mode. In the overdoped regime the preferential\ncoupling to this mode decreases and the 2DEL undergoes a crossover to a more\nconventional metallic state with weaker short-range electron-phonon\ninteraction. These results place constraints on the theoretical description of\nsuperconductivity and allow for a unified understanding of the transport\nproperties in SrTiO$_3$-based 2DELs.\n", "  Control of dispersion in fibre optical waveguides is of critical importance\nto optical fibre communications systems and more recently for continuum\ngeneration from the ultraviolet to the mid-infrared. The wavelength at which\nthe group velocity dispersion crosses zero can be set by varying fibre core\ndiameter or index step. Moreover, sophisticated methods to manipulate\nhigher-order dispersion so as shape and even flatten dispersion over wide\nbandwidths are possible using multi-cladding fibre. Here we introduce design\nand fabrication techniques that allow analogous dispersion control in\nchip-integrated optical microresonators, and thereby demonstrate higher-order,\nwide-bandwidth dispersion control over an octave of spectrum. Importantly, the\nfabrication method we employ for dispersion control simultaneously permits\noptical Q factors above 100 million, which is critical for efficient operation\nof nonlinear optical oscillators. Dispersion control in high Q systems has\ntaken on greater importance in recent years with increased interest in\nchip-integrable optical frequency combs.\n", "  A mathematical framework is proposed to predict the features of the (5 5 7)\nlath transformation in low-carbon steels based on energy minimisation. This\ntheory generates a one-parameter family of possible habit planes and a\nselection mechanism then identifies the (5 5 7) normals as those arising from a\ndeformation with small atomic movement and maximal compatibility. While the\ncalculations bear some resemblance to those of double shear theories, the\nassumptions and conclusions are different. Interestingly, the predicted\nmicrostructure morphology resembles that of plate martensite, in the sense that\na type of twinning mechanism is involved.\n", "  Using a variational model based on non-linear elasticity we investigate\nwhether in a cubic-to-tetragonal phase transformation it is energetically\npreferable to nucleate martensite within austenite. Under minimal growth\nassumptions on the free energy density $W$ away from the wells, we derive\nexplicit upper bounds on $W^{qc}({\\mathbb{I}})$, i.e. on the macroscopic free\nenergy density of a region that has been macroscopically deformed by the\nidentity map. The bounds only depend on material parameters, the temperature\ndifference and the growth of $W$ away from the wells. By comparing\n$W^{qc}({\\mathbb{I}})$ and $W({\\mathbb{I}})$ we conclude that nucleation is\nalways energetically preferable and are able to provide quantitative upper\nbounds for the gain in negative energy due to nucleation.\n", "  We have performed inelastic neutron scattering experiments to investigate the\nmagnetic excitations in the quasi-face-centered-cubic (fcc) iridate double\nperovskites La2ZnIrO6 and La2MgIrO6, which are characterized by A-type\nantiferromagnetic ground states. The neutron scattering data, which reveal\ngapped spin wave excitations with a very weak dispersion, are shown to be\nwell-described by theoretical calculations on a model Hamiltonian with dominant\nKitaev interactions. Our surprising finding shows that in contrast to honeycomb\nmaterials, where the Kitaev interaction manifests itself via complex magnetic\norder, even conventional magnetic orders in certain geometrically frustrated\nsystems might owe their existence to unconventional Kitaev exchange.\n", "  We discuss the parameter space of the Inert Doublet Model, a two Higgs\ndoublet model with a dark matter candidate. An extensive set of theoretical and\nexperimental constraints on this model is considered, where both collider as\nwell as astroparticle data limits, the latter in the form of dark matter relic\ndensity as well as direct detection, are taken into account. We discuss the\neffects of these constraints on the parameter space of the model. In\nparticular, we do not require the IDM to provide the full dark matter content\nof the universe, which opens up additional regions in the parameter space\naccessible at collider experiments. The combination of all constraints leads to\na relatively strong mass degeneracy in the dark scalar sector for masses < 200\nGeV, and to a minimal scale ~ 45 GeV for the dark scalar masses. We also\nobserve a stringent mass hierarchy MH > MA. We propose benchmark points and\nbenchmark planes for dark scalar pair-production for the current LHC run being\nin compliance with all theoretical as well as experimental bounds.\n", "  An increasing number of model results suggests that chiral symmetry is broken\ninhomogeneously in a certain window at intermediate densities in the QCD phase\ndiagram. This could have significant effects on the properties of compact\nstars, possibly leading to new astrophysical signatures. In this contribution\nwe discuss this idea by reviewing recent results on inhomogeneous chiral\nsymmetry breaking under an astrophysics-oriented perspective. After introducing\ntwo commonly studied spatial modulations of the chiral condensate, the chiral\ndensity wave and the real kink crystal, we focus on their properties and their\neffect on the equation of state of quark matter. We also describe how these\ncrystalline phases are affected by different elements which are required for a\nrealistic description of a compact star, such as charge neutrality, the\npresence of magnetic fields, vector interactions and the interplay with\ncolor-superconductivity. Finally, we discuss possible signatures of\ninhomogeneous chiral symmetry breaking in the core of compact stars,\nconsidering the cases of mass-radius relations and neutrino emissivity\nexplicitly.\n", "  We investigate intercellular insulin dynamics in an array of diffusively\ncoupled pancreatic islet \\b{eta}-cells. The cells are connected via gap\njunction coupling, where nearest neighbor interactions are included. Through\nthe multiple scale expansion in the semi-discrete approximation, we show that\nthe insulin dynamics can be governed by the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation.\nThe localized solutions of this equation are reported. The results suggest from\nthe biophysical point of view that the insulin propagates in pancreatic islet\n\\b{eta}-cells using both temporal and spatial dimensions in the form of\nlocalized modulated waves.\n", "  Background: Nuclear pasta phases, present in the inner crust of neutron\nstars, are associated with nucleonic matter at sub-saturation densities\narranged in regular shapes. Those complex phases, residing in a layer which is\napproximately 100 m thick, impact many features of neutron stars. Theoretical\nquantum-mechanical simulations of nuclear pasta are usually carried out in\nfinite 3D boxes assuming periodic boundary conditions (PBC). The resulting\nsolutions are affected by spurious finite-size effects.\n  Purpose: In order to remove spurious finite-size effects, it is convenient to\nemploy twist-averaged boundary conditions (TABC) used in condensed matter,\nnuclear matter, and lattice QCD applications. In this work, we study the\neffectiveness of TABC in the context of pasta phases simulations within nuclear\ndensity functional theory.\n  Methods: We perform Skyrme-Hartree-Fock calculations in three dimensions by\nimplementing Bloch boundary conditions. The TABC averages are obtained by means\nof Gauss-Legendre integration over twist angles.\n  Results: We benchmark the TABC for a free nucleonic gas and apply it to\nsimple cases such as the rod and slab phases, as well as to more elaborate\nP-surface and gyroidal phases.\n  Conclusions: We demonstrate that by applying TABC reliable results can be\nobtained from calculations performed in relatively small volumes. By studying\nvarious contributions to the total energy, we gain insights into pasta phases\nin mid-density range.\n", "  Type I X-ray bursts are produced by thermonuclear runaways that develop on\naccreting neutron stars. Once one location ignites, the flame propagates across\nthe surface of the star. Flame propagation is fundamental in order to\nunderstand burst properties like rise time and burst oscillations. Previous\nwork quantified the effects of rotation on the front, showing that the flame\npropagates as a deflagration and that the front strongly resembles a hurricane.\nHowever the effect of magnetic fields was not investigated, despite the fact\nthat magnetic fields strong enough to have an effect on the propagating flame\nare expected to be present on many bursters. In this paper we show how the\ncoupling between fluid layers introduced by an initially vertical magnetic\nfield plays a decisive role in determining the character of the fronts that are\nresponsible for the Type I bursts. In particular, on a star spinning at 450 Hz\n(typical among the bursters) we test seed magnetic fields of $10^{7} - 10^{10}$\nG and find that for the medium fields the magnetic stresses that develop during\nthe burst can speed up the velocity of the burning front, bringing the\nsimulated burst rise time close to the observed values. By contrast, in a\nmagnetic slow rotator like IGR J17480--2446, spinning at 11 Hz, a seed field\n$\\gtrsim 10^9$ G is required to allow localized ignition and the magnetic field\nplays an integral role in generating the burst oscillations observed during the\nbursts.\n", "  We study the low-energy spectral properties of positive center-of-mass\nconserving two-body Hamiltonians as they arise in models of fractional quantum\nHall states. Starting from the observation that positive many-body Hamiltonians\nmust have ground-state energies that increase monotonously in particle number,\nwe explore what general additional constraints can be obtained for two-body\ninteractions with \"center-of-mass conservation\" symmetry, both in the presence\nand absence of particle-hole symmetry. We find general bounds that constrain\nthe evolution of the ground-state energy with particle number, and in\nparticular, constrain the chemical potential at $T=0$. Special attention is\ngiven to Hamiltonians with zero modes, in which case similar bounds on the\nfirst excited state are also obtained, using a duality property. In this case,\nin particular, an upper bound on the charge gap is also obtained. We further\ncomment on center of mass and relative decomposition in disk geometry within\nthe framework of second quantization.\n", "  We study Efimov resonances via three-body loss in an ultracold two-component\ngas of fermionic $^6$Li and bosonic $^{133}$Cs atoms close to a Feshbach\nresonance at 843~G, extending results reported previously [Pires \\textit{et\nal.}, Phys. Rev. Lett. 112, 250404 (2014)] to temperatures around 120~nK. The\nexperimental scheme for reaching lower temperatures is based upon compensating\nthe gravity-induced spatial separation of the mass-imbalanced gases with\nbichromatic optical dipole traps. We observe the first and second excited\nLi-Cs-Cs Efimov resonance in the magnetic field dependence of the three-body\nevent rate constant, in good agreement with the universal zero-range theory at\nfinite temperature [Petrov and Werner, Phys. Rev. A 92, 022704 (2015)].\nDeviations are found for the Efimov ground state, and the inelasticity\nparameter $\\eta$ is found to be significantly larger than those for\nsingle-species systems.\n", "  Following a procedure recently utilized by Accioly et al. to obtain the\nD-dimensional interparticle potential energy for electromagnetic models in the\nnonrelativistic limit, and relaxing the condition assumed by the authors\nconcerning the conservation of the external current, the prescription found out\nby them is generalized so that dual models can also be contemplated. Specific\nmodels in which the interaction is mediated by a spin-0 particle described\nfirst by a vector field and then by a higher-derivative vector field, are\nanalyzed. Systems mediated by spin-1 particles described, respectively, by\nsymmetric rank-2 tensors, symmetric rank-2 tensors augmented by higher\nderivatives, and antisymmetric rank-2 tensors, are considered as well.\n", "  We derive the transit timing variations (TTVs) of two planets near a second\norder mean motion resonance on nearly circular orbits. We show that the TTVs of\neach planet are given by sinusoids with a frequency of $j n_2-(j-2)n_1$, where\n$j \\ge 3$ is an integer characterizing the resonance and $n_2$ and $n_1$ are\nthe mean motions of the outer and inner planets, respectively. The amplitude of\nthe TTV depends on the mass of the perturbing planet, relative to the mass of\nthe star, and on both the eccentricities and longitudes of pericenter of each\nplanet. The TTVs of the two planets are approximated anti-correlated, with\nphases of $\\phi$ and $\\approx \\phi+\\pi$, where the phase $\\phi$ also depends on\nthe eccentricities and longitudes of pericenter. Therefore, the TTVs caused by\nproximity to a second order mean motion resonance do not in general uniquely\ndetermine both planet masses, eccentricities, and pericenters. This is\ncompletely analogous to the case of TTVs induced by two planets near a first\norder mean motion resonance. We explore how other TTV signals, such as the\nshort-period synodic TTV or a first order resonant TTV, in combination with the\nsecond order resonant TTV, can break degeneracies. Lastly, we derive\napproximate formulae for the TTVs of planets near any order eccentricity-type\nmean motion resonance; this shows that the same basic sinusoidal TTV structure\nholds for all eccentricity-type resonances. Our general formula reduces to\npreviously derived results near first order mean motion resonances.\n", "  (abridged) The connection between black hole, accretion disk, and radio jet\ncan be best constrained by fitting models to observations of nearby low\nluminosity galactic nuclei, in particular the well studied sources Sgr~A* and\nM87. There has been considerable progress in modeling the central engine of\nactive galactic nuclei by an accreting supermassive black hole coupled to a\nrelativistic plasma jet. However, can a single model be applied to a range of\nblack hole masses and accretion rates? Here we want to compare the latest\nthree-dimensional numerical model, originally developed for Sgr A* in the\ncenter of the Milky Way, to radio observations of the much more powerful and\nmore massive black hole in M87. We postprocess three-dimensional GRMHD models\nof a jet-producing radiatively inefficient accretion flow around a spinning\nblack hole using relativistic radiative transfer and ray-tracing to produce\nmodel spectra and images. As a key new ingredient to these models, we allow the\nproton-electron coupling in these simulations depend on the magnetic properties\nof the plasma. We find that the radio emission in M87 is well described by a\ncombination of a two-temperature accretion flow and a hot single-temperature\njet. The model fits the basic observed characteristics of the M87 radio core.\nThe best fit model has a mass-accretion rate of Mdot approx 9x10^{-3} MSUN/YR\nand a total jet power of P_j \\sim 10^{43} erg/s. Emission at 1.3mm is produced\nby the counter jet close to the event horizon. Its characteristic crescent\nshape surrounding the black hole shadow could be resolved by future\nmillimeter-wave VLBI experiments. The model was successfully derived from one\nfor the supermassive black hole in center of the Milky Way by appropriately\nscaling mass and accretion rate. This suggests the possibility that this model\ncould also apply to a larger range of low-luminosity black holes.\n", "  This is the second paper of the series aimed at understanding the ensemble of\ninstanton-dyons, now with two flavors of light dynamical quarks. The partition\nfunction is appended by the fermionic factor, $(det T)^{N_f}$ and Dirac\neigenvalue spectra at small values are derived from the numerical simulation of\n64 and 128 dyons. Those spectra show clear chiral symmetry breaking pattern at\nhigh dyon density.\n", "  There is an intimate relation between entanglement entropy and Riemann\nsurfaces. This fact is explicitly noticed for the case of quadratic fermionic\nHamiltonians with finite range couplings. After recollecting this fact, we make\na comprehensive analysis of the action of the M\\\"obius transformations on the\nRiemann surface. We are then able to uncover the origin of some symmetries and\ndualities of the entanglement entropy already noticed recently in the\nliterature. These results give further support for the use of entanglement\nentropy to analyse phase transition.\n", "  Freezing colloidal suspensions widely exists in nature and industry.\nInterface instability has attracted much attention for the understandings of\nthe pattern formation in freezing colloidal suspensions. However, the interface\ninstability modes, the origin of the ice banding or ice lamellae, are still\nunclear. In-situ experimental observation of the onset of interface instability\nis still absent up to now. Here, by directly imaging the initial transient\nstage of planar interface instability in directional freezing colloidal\nsuspensions, we proposed three interface instability modes, Mullins-Sekerka\ninstability, global split instability and local split instability. All the\nthree instability modes come from the competition of the solute boundary layer\nand the particle boundary layer, which only can be revealed from the initial\ntransient stage of planar instability in directional freezing.\n", "  A generalized model of starlike network is suggested that takes into account\nnon-additive coupling and nonlinear transformation of coupling variables. For\nthis model a method of analysis of synchronized cluster stability is developed.\nUsing this method three starlike networks based on Ikeda, predator-prey and\nH\\'enon maps are studied.\n", "  We provide a characterization of memory effects in non-Markovian system-bath\ninteractions from a quantum information perspective. More specifically, we\nestablish sufficient conditions for which generalized measures of multipartite\nquantum, classical, and total correlations can be used to quantify the degree\nof non-Markovianity of a local quantum decohering process. We illustrate our\nresults by considering the dynamical behavior of the trace-distance\ncorrelations in multi-qubit systems under local dephasing and generalized\namplitude damping.\n", "  In this paper we investigate the loading and unloading behavior of soft\nsolids in adhesive contact with randomly rough profiles. The roughness is\nassumed to be described by a self-affine fractal on a limited range of\nwave-vectors. A spectral method is exploited to generate such randomly rough\nsurfaces. The results are statistically averaged, and the calculated contact\narea and applied load are shown as a function of the penetration, for loading\nand unloading conditions. We found that the combination of adhesion forces and\nroughness leads to a hysteresis loading-unloading loop. This shows that energy\ncan be lost simply as a consequence of roughness and van der Waals forces, as\nin this case a large number of local energy minima exist and the system may be\ntrapped in metastable states. We numerically quantify the hysteretic loss and\nassess the influence of the surface statistical properties and the energy of\nadhesion on the hysteresis process.\n", "  In this work, the CFT dual of the Schwarzschild black hole is investigated. A\nWeyl rescaling factor is presented, so that the Weyl rescaled Schwarzschild\nmetric, after a coordinate transformation, has an $AdS_{2} \\times S_{2}$\ngeometry at vicinity of its origin. Since the near origin spacetime admits an\n$AdS_{2}$ factor, it is dealt with a 2D effective gravity which is\ndimensionally reduced from the near origin solution. It is exhibited that the\ndual CFT has a central charge $c=96 M^3$ which is an asymptotic conserved\ncharge of the effective solution. Finally, the microscopic entropy of\nSchwarzschild black hole is achieved by using Cardy formula. It is revealed\nthat the microscopic entropy exactly reproduces the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy\nof the Schwarzschild black hole.\n", "  We develop interactions from chiral effective field theory (EFT) that are\ntailored to the harmonic oscillator basis. As a consequence, ultraviolet\nconvergence with respect to the model space is implemented by construction and\ninfrared convergence can be achieved by enlarging the model space for the\nkinetic energy. In oscillator EFT, matrix elements of EFTs formulated for\ncontinuous momenta are evaluated at the discrete momenta that stem from the\ndiagonalization of the kinetic energy in the finite oscillator space. By\nfitting to realistic phase shifts and deuteron data we construct an effective\ninteraction from chiral EFT at next-to-leading order. Many-body coupled-cluster\ncalculations of nuclei up to 132Sn exhibit a fast convergence of ground-state\nenergies and radii in feasible model spaces.\n", "  Using the phonon Boltzmann transport formalism and density functional theory\nbased calculations, we show that stanene has a low thermal conductivity. For a\nsample size of 1$\\times$1 $\\mu$m$^{2}$ ($L\\times W$), the lattice thermal\nconductivities along the zigzag and armchair directions are 10.83 W/m-K and 9.2\nW/m-K respectively, at room temperature, indicating anisotropy in the thermal\ntransport. The low values of thermal conductivity are due to large\nanharmonicity in the crystal resulting in high Gr\\\"{u}neisen parameters, and\nlow group velocities. The room temperature effective phonon mean free path is\nfound to be around 17 nm indicating that the thermal transport in stanene is\ncompletely diffusive in nature. Furthermore, our study brings out the relative\nimportance of the contributing phonon branches and reveals that, at very low\ntemperatures, the contribution to lattice thermal conductivity comes from the\nflexural acoustic (ZA) branch and at higher temperatures it is dominated by the\nlongitudinal acoustic (LA) branch. We also show that lattice thermal\nconductivity of stanene can further be reduced by tuning the sample size and\ncreating rough surfaces at the edges. Such tunability in the lattice thermal\nconductivity in stanene suggests its applications in thermoelectric devices.\n", "  Inspired by the experimental measurement of the Renyi entanglement entropy in\na lattice of ultracold atoms by Islam et al., [Nature 528, 77 (2015)] we\npropose a method to entangle two spatially-separated qubits using the quantum\nmany-body state as a resource. Through local operations accessible in an\nexperiment, entanglement is transferred to a qubit register from atoms at the\nends of a one-dimensional chain. We compute the operational entanglement, which\nbounds the entanglement physically transferable from the many-body resource to\nthe register, and discuss a protocol for its experimental measurement. Finally,\nwe explore measures for the amount of entanglement available in the register\nafter transfer, suitable for use in quantum information applications.\n", "  The light double $\\Lambda$ hypernuclei, ${}_{\\Lambda\\Lambda}^{\\ \\ 4}$H and\n${}_{\\Lambda\\Lambda}^{\\ \\ 6}$He, are studied as three-body $\\Lambda\\Lambda d$\nand $\\Lambda\\Lambda\\alpha$ cluster systems in halo/cluster effective field\ntheory at leading order. We find that the $\\Lambda\\Lambda d$ system in spin-0\nchannel does not exhibit a limit cycle whereas the $\\Lambda\\Lambda d$ system in\nspin-1 channel and the $\\Lambda\\Lambda\\alpha$ system in spin-0 channel do. The\nlimit cycle is associated with the formation of bound states, known as Efimov\nstates, in the unitary limit. For the $\\Lambda\\Lambda d$ system in the spin-0\nchannel we estimate the scattering length $a_0$ for $S$-wave $\\Lambda$\nhyperon-hypertriton scattering as $a_0=16.0\\pm 3.0$ fm. We also discuss that\nstudying the cutoff dependences in the $\\Lambda\\Lambda d$ and\n$\\Lambda\\Lambda\\alpha$ systems, the bound state of ${}_{\\Lambda\\Lambda}^{\\ \\\n4}$H is not an Efimov state but formed due to a high energy mechanism whereas\nthat of ${}_{\\Lambda\\Lambda}^{\\ \\ 6}$He may be regarded as an Efimov state.\n", "  Clustering methods are applied regularly in the bibliometric literature to\nidentify research areas or scientific fields. These methods are for instance\nused to group publications into clusters based on their relations in a citation\nnetwork. In the network science literature, many clustering methods, often\nreferred to as graph partitioning or community detection techniques, have been\ndeveloped. Focusing on the problem of clustering the publications in a citation\nnetwork, we present a systematic comparison of the performance of a large\nnumber of these clustering methods. Using a number of different citation\nnetworks, some of them relatively small and others very large, we extensively\nstudy the statistical properties of the results provided by different methods.\nIn addition, we also carry out an expert-based assessment of the results\nproduced by different methods. The expert-based assessment focuses on\npublications in the field of scientometrics. Our findings seem to indicate that\nthere is a trade-off between different properties that may be considered\ndesirable for a good clustering of publications. Overall, map equation methods\nappear to perform best in our analysis, suggesting that these methods deserve\nmore attention from the bibliometric community.\n", "  We study the exciton dynamics in an optically excited nanocrystal quantum\ndot. Multiple exciton formation is more efficient in nanocrystal quantum dots\ncompared to bulk semiconductors due to enhanced Coulomb interactions and the\nabsence of conservation of momentum. The formation of multiple excitons is\ndependent on different excitation parameters and the dissipation. We study this\nprocess within a Lindblad quantum rate equation using the full many-particle\nstates. We optically excite the system by creating a single high energy exciton\n$E_{SX}$ in resonance to a double exciton $E_{DX}$. With Coulomb\nelectron-electron interaction, the population can be transferred from the\nsingle exciton to the double exciton state by impact ionisation (inverse Auger\nprocess). The ratio between the recombination processes and the absorbed\nphotons provide the yield of the structure. We observe a quantum yield of\ncomparable value to experiment assuming typical experimental conditions for a\n$4$ nm PbS quantum dot.\n", "  We analyze theoretically a superlattice structure proposed by A. Andronov et\nal. [JETP Lett 102, 207 (2015)] to give Terahertz gain for an operation point\nwith positive differential conductivity. Here we confirm the existence of gain\nand show that an optimized structure displays gain above 20 cm$^{-1}$ at low\ntemperatures, so that lasing may be observable. Comparing a variety of\nsimulations, this gain is found to be strongly affected by elastic scattering.\nIt is shown that the dephasing modifies the nature of the relevant states, so\nthat the common analysis based on Wannier-Stark states is not reliable for a\nquantitative description of the gain in structures with extremely diagonal\ntransitions.\n", "  Understanding the formation of bulk metallic glasses (BMG) in metallic\nsystems and finding a reliable criterion for selection of BMG compositions are\namong the most important issues in condensed matter physics and material\nscience. Using the results of magnetic susceptibility measurements performed on\nboth amorphous and crystallized Cu-Hf alloys (30-70 at% Cu) we find a\ncorrelation between the difference in magnetic susceptibilities of\ncorresponding glassy and crystalline alloys and the variation in the glass\nforming ability (GFA) in these alloys. Since the same correlation can be\ninferred from data for the properties associated with the electronic structure\nof Cu-Zr alloys, it seems quite general and may apply to other glassy alloys\nbased on early and late transition metals. This correlation is plausible from\nthe free energy considerations and provides a simple way to select the\ncompositions with high GFA.\n", "  We present a directly generated on-chip dual-comb source at THz frequencies.\nThe multi-heterodyne beating signal of two free-running THz quantum cascade\nlaser frequency combs is measured electrically using one of the combs as a\ndetector, fully exploiting the unique characteristics of quantum cascade active\nregions. Up to 30 modes can be detected corresponding to a spectral bandwidth\nof 630 GHz, being the available bandwidth of the dual comb configuration. The\nmulti-heterodyne signal is used to investigate the equidistance of the comb\nmodes showing an accuracy of $10^{-12}$ at the carrier frequency of 2.5 THz.\n", "  This article gives an explicit formula for the leading term of the free\nenergy of three-dimensional $U(N)$ lattice gauge theory for any $N$, as the\nlattice spacing tends to zero. The proof is based on a novel technique that\navoids phase cell renormalization. The technique also yields a similar formula\nfor the four-dimensional theory, but only in the weak coupling~limit.\n", "  We discuss modified teleparallel gravity with function $f(T,T_G)$ in the\naction, where function depend on two arguments: torsion scalar $T$ and analogue\nof Gauss-Bonnet invariant $T_G$. In contradistinction to usual teleparallel\ngravity $f(T)$, this theory contains higher derivative terms, which may produce\ndifferent instabilities. We discuss Minkowski stability problem in such kind of\ntheories and explicitly demonstrate that for stability must be $f_T(0,0)<0$,\n$f_{T_GT_G}>0$. We apply these restrictions for the few types of functions\ndiscussed by the early authors.\n", "  LHC Run-2 has provided intriguing di-photon signals of a new resonance around\n750GeV, which, if not due to statistical fluctuations, must call for new\nphysics beyond the standard model (SM) at TeV scale. We propose a minimal\nextension of the SM with a complex singlet scalar $\\mathcal{S}$ and a doublet\nof vector-like quarks. The scalar sector respects CP symmetry, with its CP-odd\nimaginary component $\\chi$ providing a natural dark matter (DM) candidate. The\nreal component of $\\mathcal{S}$ serves as the new resonance (750GeV) and\nexplains the diphoton excess of the LHC Run-2. The new scalar degrees of\nfreedom of $\\mathcal{S}$ help to stabilize the Higgs vacuum, and can realize\nthe Higgs inflation around GUT scale, consistent with the current cosmology\nobservations. We construct two representative samples A and B of our model for\ndemonstration. We study the mono-jet signals of the DM production from\ninvisible decays Re$(\\mathcal{S}) \\to \\chi\\chi$ at the LHC Run-2. We further\nderive the DM relic density bound, and analyze the constraints from direct and\nindirect DM detections.\n", "  We consider the bosonic sectors of supergravity theories in ten and eleven\ndimensions which correspond to the low energy limits of string theories and\nM-theory. The solutions of supergravity field equations are known as\nsupergravity backgrounds and the number of preserved supersymmetries in those\nbackgrounds are determined by Killing spinors. We provide some examples of\nsupergravity backgrounds which preserve different fractions of supersymmetry.\nAn important invariant for the characterization of supergravity backgrounds is\ntheir Killing superalgebras which are constructed out of Killing vectors and\nKilling spinors of the background. After constructing Killing superalgebras of\nsome special supergravity backgrounds, we discuss about the possibilities of\nthe extensions of these superalgebras to include the higher degree hidden\nsymmetries of the background.\n", "  The surfaces of metal oxides often are reconstructed with a geometry and\ncomposition that is considerably different from a simple termination of the\nbulk. Such structures can also be viewed as ultrathin films, epitaxed on a\nsubstrate. Here, the reconstructions of the SrTiO3 (110) surface are studied\ncombining scanning tunneling microscopy, transmission electron diffraction, and\nX-ray absorption spectroscopy, and analyzed with density functional theory\ncalculations. While SrTiO3 (110) invariably terminates with an overlayer of\ntitania, with increasing density its structure switches from nx1 and 2xn. At\nthe same time the coordination of the Ti atoms changes from a network of\ncorner-sharing tetrahedra to a double layer of edge-shared octahedra with\nbridging units of octahedrally coordinated strontium. This transition from the\nnx1 to 2xn reconstructions is a transition from a pseudomorphically stabilized\ntetrahedral network towards an octahedral titania thin film with stress-relief\nfrom octahedral strontia units at the surface.\n", "  In this work we include electron-electron interaction beyond Hartree-Fock\nlevel in our non-equilibrium Green's function approach by a crude form of GW\nthrough the Single Plasmon Pole Approximation. This is achieved by treating all\nconduction band electrons as a single effective band screening the Coulomb\npotential. We describe the corresponding self-energies in this scheme for a\nmulti-subband system. In order to apply the formalism to heterostructures we\ndiscuss the screening and plasmon dispersion in both 2D and 3D systems. Results\nare shown for a four well quantum cascade laser with different doping\nconcentration where comparisons to experimental findings can be made.\n", "  The diagonal Born-Oppenheimer correction (DBOC) stems from the diagonal\nsecond derivative coupling term in the adiabatic representation, and it can\nhave an arbitrary large magnitude when a gap between neighbouring\nBorn-Oppenheimer (BO) potential energy surfaces (PESs) is closing.\nNevertheless, DBOC is typically neglected in mixed quantum-classical methods of\nsimulating nonadiabatic dynamics (e.g., fewest-switch surface hopping (FSSH)\nmethod). A straightforward addition of DBOC to BO PESs in the FSSH method,\nFSSH+D, has been shown to lead to numerically much inferior results for models\ncontaining conical intersections. More sophisticated variation of the DBOC\ninclusion, phase-space surface-hopping (PSSH) was more successful than FSSH+D\nbut on model problems without conical intersections. This work comprehensively\nassesses the role of DBOC in nonadiabatic dynamics of two electronic state\nproblems and the performance of FSSH, FSSH+D, and PSSH methods in variety of\none- and two-dimensional models. Our results show that the inclusion of DBOC\ncan enhance the accuracy of surface hopping simulations when two conditions are\nsimultaneously satisfied: 1) nuclei have kinetic energy lower than DBOC and 2)\nPESs are not strongly nonadiabatically coupled. The inclusion of DBOC is\ndetrimental in situations where its energy scale becomes very high or even\ndiverges, because in these regions PESs are also very strongly coupled. In this\ncase, the true quantum formalism heavily relies on an interplay between\ndiagonal and off-diagonal nonadiabatic couplings while surface hopping\napproaches treat diagonal terms as PESs and off-diagonal ones stochastically.\n", "  In the present paper, we revisit gravitational theories which are invariant\nunder TDiffs -- transverse (volume preserving) diffeomorphisms and global scale\ntransformations. It is known that these theories can be rewritten in an\nequivalent diffeomorphism-invariant form with an action including an\nintegration constant (cosmological constant for the particular case of\nnon-scale-invariant unimodular gravity). The presence of this integration\nconstant, in general, breaks explicitly scale invariance and induces a runaway\npotential for the (otherwise massless) dilaton, associated with the determinant\nof the metric tensor. We show, however, that if the metric carries mass\ndimension $\\left[\\text{GeV}\\right]^{-2}$, the scale invariance of the system is\npreserved, unlike the situation in theories in which the metric has mass\ndimension different from $-2$. The dilaton remains massless and couples to\nother fields only through derivatives, without any conflict with observations.\nWe observe that one can define a specific limit for fields and their\nderivatives (in particular, the dilaton goes to zero, potentially related to\nthe small distance domain of the theory) in which the only singular terms in\nthe action correspond to the Higgs mass and the cosmological constant. We\nspeculate that the self-consistency of the theory may require the regularity of\nthe action, leading to the absence of the bare Higgs mass and cosmological\nconstant, whereas their small finite values may be generated by nonperturbative\neffects.\n", "  We would like to comment that the prediction of Half-mtallicity in only B\nedge H-passivated zigzag boron nitride nanoribbons (ZBNNR-BH), by Zheng et\nal.1, is not correct as their interpretation is erroneous. Since it is well\nknown that for a material, to be a half-metal, as a primary condition one type\nof spin channels or bands (either spin up or spin down) are conducting and the\nopposite ones are insulating. In commented article 1, ZBNNR-BH shows insulating\nbehavior for spin up bands (Eg=4.5 eV) whereas conducting nature for spin down\nelectrons. They claim1 through the electronic band structure of 8-ZBNNR-BH [as\nshown in figure 2 (b)]1, that spin down - Alpha (conduction band minimum - CBM)\nand Beta (valence band maximum - VBM) bands are crossing each other at the\nFermi level (green dotted line) and thus the ribbons are conducting for spin\ndown electrons. But this crossing of two same spin bands is impossible because\naccording to well-known Paulis exclusion principle- Two identical fermions\n(particles with half-integer spin) cannot occupy the same quantum state\nsimultaneously.In the case of electrons, it is impossible for two electrons of\na poly-electron atom to have the same values of the four quantum numbers (n, l,\nml and ms). Thus for two electrons residing in the same orbital (same energy\nlevel e.g. above stated crossing point 1), n, l, and ml are the same, so ms\nmust be different and the electrons must have opposite spins.\n", "  We use Rabi spectroscopy to explore the low-energy excitation spectrum of a\nfinite-temperature Bose gas of rubidium atoms across the phase transition to a\nBose-Einstein condensate (BEC). To record this spectrum, we coherently drive\nthe atomic population between two spin states. A small relative displacement of\nthe spin-specific trapping potentials enables sideband transitions between\ndifferent motional states. The intrinsic non-linearity of the motional\nspectrum, mainly originating from two-body interactions, makes it possible to\nresolve and address individual excitation lines. Together with sensitive\natom-counting, this constitutes a feasible technique to count single excited\natoms of a BEC and to determine the temperature of nearly pure condensates. As\nan example, we show that for a nearly pure BEC of N = 800 atoms the first\nexcited state has a population of less than 5 atoms, corresponding to an upper\nbound on the temperature of 30 nK.\n", "  Adhesion plays an integral role in diverse biological functions ranging from\ncellular transport to tissue development. Estimation of adhesion strength,\ntherefore, becomes important to gain biophysical insight into these phenomena.\nIn this Letter, we use curvature elasticity to present non-intuitive, yet\nremarkably simple, universal relationships that capture vesicle-substrate\ninteractions. Our study reveals that the inverse of the height, exponential of\nthe contact area, and the force required to detach the vesicle from the\nsubstrate vary linearly with the square root of the adhesion energy. These\nrelationships not only provide efficient strategies to tease out adhesion\nenergy of biological molecules but can also be used to characterize the\nphysical properties of elastic biomimetic nanoparticles. We validate the\nmodeling predictions with experimental data from two previous studies.\n", "  In this paper, we study entropic uncertainty relations on a\nfinite-dimensional Hilbert space and provide several tighter bounds for\nmulti-measurements, with some of them also valid for R\\'{e}nyi and Tsallis\nentropies besides the Shannon entropy. We employ majorization theory and\nactions of the symmetric group to obtain an {\\it admixture bound} for entropic\nuncertainty relations for multi-measurements. Comparisons among all bounds for\nmulti-measurements are shown in figures in our favor.\n", "  We show that 63Cu NMR spectra place strong constraints on both the nature and\nthe concentration of oxygen defects in ortho-II YBa2Cu3Oy. Systematic deviation\nfrom ideal ortho-II order is revealed by the presence of inequivalent Cu sites\nin either full or empty chains. The results can be explained by two kinds of\ndefects: oxygen clustering into additional chains, or fragments thereof, most\nlikely present at all concentrations (6.4<y<6.6) and oxygen vacancies randomly\ndistributed in the full chains for y<6.50 only. Furthermore, the remarkable\nreproducibility of the spectra in different samples with optimal ortho-II order\n(y=6.55) shows that chain-oxygen disorder, known to limit electronic coherence,\nis ineluctable because it is inherent to these compounds.\n", "  Using ambient pressure x-ray and high pressure neutron diffraction, we\nstudied the pressure effect on structural and magnetic properties of\nmultiferroic Mn$_{1-x}$Co$_x$WO$_4$ single crystals ($x=0, 0.05, 0.135$ and\n$0.17$), and compared it with the effects of doping. Both Co doping and\npressure stretch the Mn-Mn chain along the $c$~direction. At high doping level\n($x=0.135$ and $0.17$), pressure and Co doping drive the system in a similar\nway and induce a spin-flop transition for the $x=0.135$ compound. In contrast,\nmagnetic ground states at lower doping level ($x=0$ and $0.05$) are robust\nagainst pressure but experience a pronounced change upon Co substitution. As Co\nintroduces both chemical pressure and magnetic anisotropy into the frustrated\nmagnetic system, our results suggest the magnetic anisotropy is the main\ndriving force for the Co induced phase transitions at low doping level, and\nchemical pressure plays a more significant role at higher Co concentrations.\n", "  We introduce and illustrate a new approach to the unknotting problem via the\ndynamics of vortex strings in a nonlinear partial differential equation of\nreaction-diffusion type. To untangle a given knot, a Biot-Savart construction\nis used to initialize the knot as a vortex string in the FitzHugh-Nagumo\nequation. Remarkably, we find that the subsequent evolution preserves the\ntopology of the knot and can untangle an unknot into a circle. Illustrative\ntest case examples are presented, including the untangling of a hard unknot\nknown as the culprit. Our approach to the unknotting problem has two novel\nfeatures, in that it applies field theory rather than particle mechanics and\nuses reaction-diffusion dynamics in place of energy minimization.\n", "  We consider an electron wave packet evolution in the external deterministic\nelectric field with Gaussian white noise addition. An explicit expression was\ngiven for the averaged probability flux with Gaussian initial wave function. We\nshow that the noise addition increases wave packet spreading rate, which has a\nsignificant influence on flux amplitude and may play both destructive and\nconstructive role. This depends on the form and amplitude of external\ndeterministic field.\n", "  We analyzed a deep Chandra observation (334 ks) of the galaxy cluster Abell\n115 and detected a shock co-spatial with the radio relic. The X-ray surface\nbrightness profile across the shock region presents a discontinuity,\ncorresponding to a density compression factor $\\mathcal{C}=2.0\\pm0.1$ leading\nto a Mach number $\\mathcal{M}=1.7\\pm0.1$ ($\\mathcal{M}=1.4-2$ including\nsystematics). Temperatures measured in the upstream and downstream regions are\nconsistent with what expected for such a shock:\n$T_u=4.3^{+1.0}_{-0.6}\\:\\rm{keV}$ and $T_d=7.9^{+1.4}_{-1.1}\\:\\rm{keV}$\nrespectively, implying a Mach number $\\mathcal{M}=1.8^{+0.5}_{-0.4}$. So far,\nonly few other shocks discovered in galaxy clusters are consistently detected\nfrom both density and temperature jumps. The spatial coincidence between this\ndiscontinuity and the radio relic edge strongly supports the view that shocks\nplay a crucial role in powering these synchrotron sources. We suggest that the\nrelic is originated by shock re-acceleration of relativistic electrons rather\nthan acceleration from the thermal pool. The position and curvature of the\nshock and the associated relic are consistent with an off-axis merger with\nunequal mass ratio where the shock is expected to bend around the core of the\nless massive cluster.\n", "  We show that the mass function method makes it much easier to obtain the\nexact solutions of Einstein equations. The known solutions for empty space and\nfor the universe filled with dust-like matter are considered from the point of\nview of the method and new exact solutions are obtained. Generalized solutions\nfor the Schwarzschild type black holes are considered. It is shown that such\nblack holes always contain non-baryonic matter. New exact solution for the\nblack hole embedded into dust matter cosmological background is obtained.\n", "  In this paper, we generalize Chow-Luo's combinatorial Ricci flow to inversive\ndistance circle packing setting. Although the solution to the generalized flow\nmay develop singularities in finite time, we can always extend the solution so\nas it exists for all time and converges exponentially fast. Thus the\ngeneralized flow can be used to deform any inversive distance circle packing to\na unique packing with prescribed cone angle. We also give partial results on\nthe range of all admissible cone angles, which generalize the classical\nAndreev-Thurston's theorem.\n", "  Assuming that the short gamma-ray burst detected by the Fermi Gamma-Ray Space\nTelescope about 0.4 seconds after the gravitational waves observed by the LIGO\nand VIRGO Collaborations originated from the same black hole merger event, we\nperform a model-independent analysis of different quantum gravity scenarios\nbased on (modified) dispersion relations (typical of quantum gravity models)\nfor the graviton and the photon. We find that only scenarios where at least one\nof the two particles is luminal (the other being sub- or super-luminal) are\nallowed, while scenarios where none of the two particles is luminal are ruled\nout. Moreover, the physical request of having acceptable values for the quantum\ngravity scale imposes stringent bounds on the difference between the velocities\nof electromagnetic and gravitational waves, much more stringent than any\npreviously known bound.\n", "  We discuss the observation that under neutron star conditions of charge\nneutrality and $\\beta-$equilibrium the contribution from the symmetry energy to\nthe equation of state (EoS) follows a universal behaviour. We call this\nbehaviour the conjecture of a Universal Symmetry Energy Contribution (USEC). We\nfind that an USEC holds provided the density dependence of the symmetry energy\n$E_s(n)$ follows a behaviour that limits the proton fraction $x(n)$ to values\nbelow the threshold for the direct Urca (DU) cooling process. The absence of DU\ncooling in typical mass neutron stars appears to be supported by the\nphenomenology of neutron star cooling data and allows to constrain the\nbehaviour of $E_s(n)$ at high densities. Two classes of symmetry energy\nfunctions are investigated more in detail to elucidate the USEC. We derive an\nanalytic formula for the USEC to the neutron star EoS based on the result for\nthe symmetry energy extracted from isobaric analog states of nuclei.\n", "  While the tracking detectors of the ATLAS and CMS experiments have shown\nexcellent performance in Run 1 of LHC data taking, and are expected to continue\nto do so during LHC operation at design luminosity, both experiments will have\nto exchange their tracking systems when the LHC is upgraded to the\nhigh-luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) around the year 2024. The new tracking systems\nneed to operate in an environment in which both the hit densities and the\nradiation damage will be about an order of magnitude higher than today. In\naddition, the new trackers need to contribute to the first level trigger in\norder to maintain a high data-taking efficiency for the interesting processes.\nNovel detector technologies have to be developed to meet these very challenging\ngoals. The German groups active in the upgrades of the ATLAS and CMS tracking\nsystems have formed a collaborative \"Project on Enabling Technologies for\nSilicon Microstrip Tracking Detectors at the HL-LHC\" (PETTL), which was\nsupported by the Helmholtz Alliance \"Physics at the Terascale\" during the years\n2013 and 2014. The aim of the project was to share experience and to work\ntogether on key areas of mutual interest during the R&D phase of these\nupgrades. The project concentrated on five areas, namely exchange of\nexperience, radiation hardness of silicon sensors, low mass system design,\nautomated precision assembly procedures, and irradiations. This report\nsummarizes the main achievements.\n", "  Ultraluminous X-ray sources are extragalactic, off-nucleus, point sources in\ngalaxies with an X-ray luminosity above 3x10^39 erg/s, thought to be powered by\naccretion onto a compact object. Possible explanations include accretion onto\nneutron stars with strong magnetic fields, stellar-mass black holes (< 20\nMsolar) at or in excess of the classical Eddington limit or intermediate-mass\nblack holes (10^3-5 Msolar). The lack of sufficient energy resolution in\nprevious analyses has hitherto prevented an unambiguous identification of any\nemission or absorption lines in the X-ray band, thereby precluding a detailed\nanalysis of the accretion flow. Here we report the presence of X-ray emission\nlines arising from highly ionized iron, oxygen and neon with a cumulative\nsignificance > 5 sigma, and blueshifted (~0.2c) absorption lines (5 sigma) in\nthe high-resolution X-ray spectrum of the ultraluminous X-ray source NGC 1313\nX-1. In a similar source, NGC 5408 X-1, we also detect emission lines at rest\nand blueshifted absorption. The blueshifted absorption lines must occur in a\nfast outflowing gas, whereas the emission lines originate in slow-moving gas\naround the source. We conclude that the compact object is surrounded by\npowerful winds with an outflow velocity of about 0.2c as predicted by models of\naccreting supermassive black holes and hyper-accreting stellar mass black\nholes.\n", "  Applicability of dilute magnetic semiconductors (DMS) in electronic devices\nrelies upon the understanding and control of their magnetic anisotropy. This\npaper explores one of the ways in engineering magnetic anisotropy in epitaxial\nlayers of DMS by forming them into magnonic structures. For this purpose the\ncanonical ferromagnetic DMS, namely (Ga,Mn)As, is employed. The anti-dot\nsystems based on (Ga,Mn)As layers of various thicknesses are fabricated with\nfocused ion beam apparatus and studied by means of microscopy as well as\nmagnetometry. The magnetometric data - collected along two nonequivalent\nin-plane crystallographic directions of (Ga,Mn)As: [110] and [1-10] - shows the\neffect of structuring on high-field magnetization process, whereas no\nsignificant change of the width of hysteresis loop in anti-dot samples is\nobserved.\n", "  We investigate the quantum phase diagram of t-J model on triangular lattice\nat 1/2 doping with various lattice sizes by using a combination of density\nmatrix renormalization group (DMRG), variational Monte Carlo and quantum field\ntheories. To sharply distinguish different phases, we calculated the symmetry\nquantum numbers of the ground state wave functions, and the results are further\nconfirmed by studying correlation functions. Our results show there is a first\norder phase transition from ferromagnetism to d+id superconductivity, with the\ntransition taking place at $J/t=0.4\\pm0.2$.\n", "  Low-lying excited states of the neutron-rich calcium isotopes $^{48-52}$Ca\nhave been studied via $\\gamma$-ray spectroscopy following inverse-kinematics\nproton scattering on a liquid hydrogen target using the GRETINA $\\gamma$-ray\ntracking array. The energies and strengths of the octupole states in these\nisotopes are remarkably constant, indicating that these states are dominated by\nproton excitations.\n", "  In this work, we construct and test an analytical and a semianalytical\nsecular models for two planets locked in a coorbital non-coplanar motion,\ncomparing some results with the case of restricted three body problem.\n  The analytical average model replicates the numerical N-body integrations,\neven for moderate eccentricities ($\\lesssim$ 0.3) and inclinations\n($\\lesssim10^\\circ$), except for the regions corresponding to quasi-satellite\nand Lidov-Kozai configurations. Furthermore, this model is also useful in the\nrestricted three body problem, assuming very low mass ratio between the\nplanets. We also describe a four-degree-of-freedom semianalytical model valid\nfor any type of coorbital configuration in a wide range of eccentricities and\ninclinations.\n  {Using a N-body integrator, we have found that the phase space of the General\nThree Body Problem is different to the restricted case for inclined systems,\nand establish the location of the Lidov-Kozai equilibrium configurations\ndepending on mass ratio. We study the stability of periodic orbits in the\ninclined systems, and find that apart from the robust configurations $L_4$,\n$AL_4$, and $QS$ is possible to harbour two Earth-like planets in orbits\npreviously identified as unstable $U$ and also in Euler $L_3$ configurations,\nwith bounded chaos.\n", "  We put forth a dynamic modeling framework for sub-grid parametrization of\nlarge eddy simulation of turbulent flows based upon the use of the approximate\ndeconvolution procedure to compute the Smagorinsky constant self-adaptively\nfrom the resolved flow quantities. Our numerical assessments for solving the\nBurgers turbulence problem shows that the proposed approach could be used as a\nviable tool to address the turbulence closure problem due to its flexibility.\n", "  Based on observations performed with the Pulkovo normal astrograph in\n2008-2015 and data from sky surveys (DSS, 2MASS, SDSS DR12, WISE), we have\ninvestigated the motions of 1308 stars with proper motions larger than 300\nmas/yr down to magnitude 17. The main idea of our search for binary stars based\non this material is reduced to comparing the quasi-mean (POSS2-POSS1; an epoch\ndifference of $\\approx$50 yr) and quasi-instantaneous (2MASS, SDSS, WISE,\nPulkovo; an epoch difference of $\\approx$10 yr) proper motions. If the\ndifference is statistically significant compared to the proper motion errors,\nthen the object may be considered as a {\\Delta}{\\mu}-binary candidate. One\nhundred and twenty one stars from among those included in the observational\nprogram satisfy this requirement. Additional confirmations of binarity for a\nnumber of stars have been obtained by comparing the calculated proper motions\nwith the data from several programs of stellar trigonometric parallax\ndeterminations and by analyzing the asymmetry of stellar images on sky-survey\nCCD frames. Analysis of the highly accurate SDSS photometric data for four\nstars (J0656+3827, J0838+3940, J1229+5332, J2330+4639) allows us to reach a\nconclusion about the probability that these {\\Delta}{\\mu} binaries are white\ndwarf + M dwarf pairs.\n", "  Distributed order fractional operators offer a rigorous tool for mathematical\nmodelling of multi-physics phenomena, where the differential orders are\ndistributed over a range of values rather than being just a fixed\ninteger/fraction as it is in standard/fractional ODEs/PDEs. We develop two\nspectrally-accurate schemes, namely a Petrov-Galerkin spectral method and a\nspectral collocation method for distributed order fractional differential\nequations. These schemes are developed based on the fractional Sturm-Liouville\neigen-problems (FSLPs). In the Petrov-Galerkin method, we employ fractional\n(non-polynomial) basis functions, called \\textit{Jacobi poly-fractonomials},\nwhich are the eigenfunctions of the FSLP of first kind, while, we employ\nanother space of test functions as the span of poly-fractonomial eigenfunctions\nof the FSLP of second kind. We define the underlying \\textit{distributed\nSobolev space} and the associated norms, where we carry out the corresponding\ndiscrete stability and error analyses of the proposed scheme. In the\ncollocation scheme, we employ fractional (non-polynomial) Lagrange interpolants\nsatisfying the Kronecker delta property at the collocation points.\nSubsequently, we obtain the corresponding distributed differentiation matrices\nto be employed in the discretization of the strong problem. We perform\nsystematic numerical tests to demonstrate the efficiency and conditioning of\neach method.\n", "  We model and simulate the stepping dynamics of the kinesin motor including\nelectric and mechanical forces, environmental noise, and the complicated\npotentials produced by tracking and neighboring protofilaments. Our dynamical\nmodel supports the hand-over-hand mechanism of the kinesin stepping. Our\ntheoretical predictions and numerical simulations include the off-axis\ndisplacements of the kinesin heads while the steps are performed. The results\nobtained are in a good agreement with recent experiments on the kinesin\ndynamics.\n", "  We study the unextendible maximally entangled bases (UMEB) in\n$\\mathbb{C}^{d}\\bigotimes\\mathbb{C}^{d}$ and connect it with the partial\nHadamard matrix. Firstly, we show that for a given special UMEB in\n$\\mathbb{C}^{d}\\bigotimes\\mathbb{C}^{d}$, there is a partial Hadamard matrix\ncan not extend to a complete Hadamard matrix in $\\mathbb{C}^{d}$. As a\ncorollary, any $(d-1)\\times d$ partial Hadamard matrix can extend to a complete\nHadamard matrix. Then we obtain that for any $d$ there is an UMEB except $d=p\\\n\\text{or}\\ 2p$, where $p\\equiv 3\\mod 4$ and $p$ is a prime. Finally, we argue\nthat there exist different kinds of constructions of UMEB in\n$\\mathbb{C}^{nd}\\bigotimes\\mathbb{C}^{nd}$ for any $n\\in \\mathbb{N}$ and\n$d=3\\times5 \\times7$.\n", "  Monolayer WSe2 is a two dimensional (2D) semiconductor with a direct bandgap,\nand it has been recently explored as a promising material for electronics and\noptoelectronics. Low field effect mobility is the main constraint preventing\nWSe2 from becoming one of the competing channel materials for field-effect\ntransistors (FETs). Recent results have demonstrated that chemical treatments\ncan modify the electrical properties of transition metal dichalcogenides\n(TMDCs) including MoS2 and WSe2. Here, we report that controlled heating in air\nsignificantly improves device performance of WSe2 FETs in terms of on-state\ncurrents and field-effect mobilities. Specifically, after heating at optimized\nconditions, chemical vapor deposition grown monolayer WSe2 FETs showed an\naverage FET mobility of 31 cm2/Vs and on/off current ratios up to 5*108. For\nfew-layer WSe2 FETs, after the same treatment applied, we achieved a high\nmobility up to 92 cm2/Vs. These values are significantly higher than FETs\nfabricated using as-grown WSe2 flakes without heating treatment, demonstrating\nthe effectiveness of air heating on the performance improvements of WSe2 FETs.\nThe underlying chemical processes involved during air heating and the formation\nof in-plane heterojunctions of WSe2 and WO3-x, which is believed to be the\nreason for the improved FET performance, were studied by spectroscopy and\ntransmission electron microscopy. We further demonstrated that by combining air\nheating method developed in this work with supporting 2D materials on BN\nsubstrate, we achieved a noteworthy field effect mobility of 83 cm2/Vs for\nmonolayer WSe2 FETs. This work is a step towards controlled modification of the\nproperties of WSe2 and potentially other TMDCs, and may greatly improve device\nperformance for future applications of 2D materials in electronics and\noptoelectronics.\n", "  In this paper we consider Schr\\\"oodinger operators with potentials of order\nzero on asymptotically conic manifolds. We prove the existence and the\ncompleteness of the wave operators with a naturally defined free Hamiltonian.\n", "  Through the solid state reaction method, we synthesized a new BiSe2-based\nsuperconductor Sr0:5La0:5FBiSe2 with superconducting transition temperature\nTc?3.8 K. A strong diamagnetic signal below Tc in susceptibility ?(T) is\nobserved indicating the bulk nature of superconductivity. Different to most\nBiS2-based compounds where superconductivity develops from a\nsemiconducting-like normal state, the present compound exhibits a metallic\nbehavior down to Tc. Under weak magnetic field or pressure, however, a\nremarkable crossover from metallic to insulating behaviors takes place around\nTmin where the resistivity picks up a local minimum. With increasing pressure,\nTc decreases monotonously and Tmin shifts to high temperatures, while the\nabsolute value of the normal state resistivity at low temperatures first\ndecreases and then increases with pressure up to 2.5 GPa. These results imply\nthat the electronic structure of Sr0:5La0:5FBiSe2 may be different to those in\nthe other BiS2-based systems.\n", "  In the context of the half-centenary of Hagedorn temperature and the\nstatistical bootstrap model (SBM) we present a short account of how these\ninsights coincided with the establishment of the hot big-bang model (BBM) and\nhelped resolve some of the early philosophical difficulties. We then turn\nattention to the present day context and show the dominance of strong\ninteraction quark and gluon degrees of freedom in the early stage, helping to\ncharacterize the properties of the hot Universe. We focus attention on the\ncurrent experimental insights about cosmic microwave background (CMB)\ntemperature fluctuation, and develop a much improved understanding of the\nneutrino freeze-out, in this way paving the path to the opening of a direct\nconnection of quark-gluon plasma (QGP) physics in the early Universe with the\nQCD-lattice, and the study of the properties of QGP formed in the laboratory.\n", "  We recall how nearly half a century ago the proposal was made to explore the\nstructure of the quantum vacuum using slow heavy-ion collisions. Pursuing this\ntopic we review the foundational concept of spontaneous vacuum decay\naccompanied by observable positron emission in heavy-ion collisions and\ndescribe the related theoretical developments in strong fields QED.\n", "  We propose a deterministic remote state preparation (RSP) scheme for\npreparing an arbitrary (including pure and mixed) qubit, where a partially\nentangled state and finite classical communication are used. To our knowledge,\nour scheme is the first RSP scheme that fits into this category. One other RSP\nscheme proposed by Berry shares close features, but can only be used to prepare\nan arbitrary pure qubit. Even so, our scheme saves classical communication by\napproximate 1 bit per prepared qubit under equal conditions. When using a\nmaximally entangled state, the classical communication for our scheme is 2\nbits, which agrees with Lo's conjecture on the resource cost. Furthermore Alice\ncan switch between our RSP scheme and a standard teleportation scheme without\nletting Bob know, which makes the quantum channel multipurpose.\n", "  We address the recently posed question as to whether the nonlocality of a\nsingle member of an entangled pair of spin $1/2$ particles can be shared among\nmultiple observers on the other wing who act sequentially and independently of\neach other [1]. We first show that the optimality condition for the trade-off\nbetween information gain and disturbance in the context of weak or non-ideal\nmeasurements emerges naturally when one employs a one-parameter class of\npositive operator valued measures (POVMs). Using this formalism we then prove\nanalytically that it is impossible to obtain violation of the\nClauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality by more than two Bobs in one of\nthe two wings using unbiased input settings with an Alice in the other wing.\n", "  We give sufficient conditions for asymptotic stabilization of equilibrium\npoints and periodic orbits of a dynamical system when we add a geometric\ndissipation of gradient type. We also describe the domain of attraction in the\ncase of asymptotic stability.\n", "  We derive Bose-Einstein statistics and Fermi-Dirac statistics by Principle of\nMaximum Entropy applied to two families of entropy functions different from the\nBoltzmann-Gibbs-Shannon entropy. These entropy functions are identified with\nspecial cases of modified Naudts' $\\phi$-entropy.\n", "  Cr2Ge2Te6 has been of interest for decades, as it is one of only a few\nnaturally forming ferromagnetic semiconductors. Recently, this material has\nbeen revisited due to its potential as a 2 dimensional semiconducting\nferromagnet and a substrate to induce anomalous quantum Hall states in\ntopological insulators. However, many relevant properties of Cr2Ge2Te6 still\nremain poorly understood, especially the spin-phonon coupling crucial to\nspintronic, multiferrioc, thermal conductivity, magnetic proximity and the\nestablishment of long range order on the nanoscale. We explore the interplay\nbetween the lattice and magnetism through high resolution micro-Raman\nscattering measurements over the temperature range from 10 K to 325 K. Strong\nspin-phonon coupling effects are confirmed from multiple aspects: two low\nenergy modes splits in the ferromagnetic phase, magnetic quasielastic\nscattering in paramagnetic phase, the phonon energies of three modes show clear\nupturn below Tc, and the phonon linewidths change dramatically below Tc as\nwell. Our results provide the first demonstration of spin-phonon coupling in a\npotential 2 dimensional atomic crystal.\n", "  Phase transitions, as the condensation of a gas to a liquid, are often\nrevealed by a discontinuous behavior of thermodynamic quantities. For liquid\nHelium, for example, a divergence of the specific heat signals the transition\nfrom the normal fluid to the superfluid state. Apart from liquid helium,\ndetermining the specific heat of a Bose gas has proven to be a challenging\ntask, for example for ultracold atomic Bose gases. Here we examine the\nthermodynamic behavior of a trapped two-dimensional photon gas, a system that\nallows us to spectroscopically determine the specific heat and the entropy of a\nnearly ideal Bose gas from the classical high temperature to the Bose-condensed\nquantum regime. The critical behavior at the phase transition is clearly\nrevealed by a cusp singularity of the specific heat. Regarded as a test of\nquantum statistical mechanics, our results demonstrate a quantitative agreement\nwith its predictions at the microscopic level.\n", "  To optimize the adhesion of layers presenting strong barrier properties on\nlow-density polyethylene (LDPE) surfaces, we investigated the influence of\nargon and argon-oxygen atmospheric pressure post-discharges. This study was\nperformed using x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy,\noptical emission spectroscopy (OES) and dynamic water contact angle (WCA)\nmeasurements. After the plasma treatment, a slight increase in the roughness\nwas emphasized, more particularly for the samples treated in a post-discharge\nsupplied in oxygen. Measurements of the surface roughness and of the oxygen\nsurface concentration suggested the competition of two processes playing a role\non the surface hydrophilicity and occurring during the post-discharge\ntreatment: the etching and the activation of the surface. The etching rate was\nestimated to about 2.7 nm.s-1 and 5.8 nm.s-1 for Ar and Ar-O2 post-discharges,\nrespectively. The mechanisms underlying this etching were investigated through\nexperiments, in which we discuss the influence of the O2 flow rate and the\ndistance (gap) separating the plasma torch from the LDPE surface located\ndownstream. O atoms and NO molecules (emitting in the UV range) detected by OES\nseem to be good candidates to explain the etching process. An ageing study is\nalso presented to evidence the stability of the treated surfaces over 60 days.\nAfter 60 days of storage, we showed that whatever the O2 flow rate, the treated\nfilms registered a loss of their hydrophilic state since their WCA increased\ntowards a common threshold of 80{\\textdegree}. This 'hydrophobic recovery'\neffect was mostly attributed to the reorientation of induced polar chemical\ngroups into the bulk of the material. Indeed, the relative concentrations of\nthe carbonyl and carboxyl groups at the surface decreased with the storage time\nand seemed to reach a plateau after 30 days.\n", "  Low density polyethylene (LDPE) surfaces have been plasma modified to improve\ntheir nanostructural and wettability properties. These modifications can\nsignificantly improve the deposition of subsequent layers such as films with\nspecific barrier properties. For this purpose, we compare the treatments\ninduced by two atmospheric plasma torches with different configurations\n(showerhead vs. linear). The modifications of LDPE films in terms of chemical\nsurface composition and surface morphology are evidenced by X-ray photoelectron\nspectro-scopy, water contact angles measurements, and atomic force microscopy.\nA comparison between the two post-discharge treatments is achieved for several\ntorch-to-substrate distances (gaps), treatment times, and oxygen flow rates in\nterms of etching rate, roughening rate, diffusion of oxygen into the\nsubsur-face and hydrophilicity. By correlating these results with the chemical\ncomposition of the post-discharges, we identify and compare the 'species which\nare responsible for the chemical surface functionalization, the surface\nroughening, and etching.\n", "  In this experimental study, a flowing dielectric barrier discharge operating\nat atmospheric pressure is used for the splitting of CO2 into O2 and CO. The\ninfluence of the applied frequency and plasma power on the microdischarge\nproperties is investigated to understand their role on the CO2 conversion.\nElectrical measurements are carried out to explain the conversion trends and to\ncharacterize the microdischarges through their number, their lifetime, their\nintensity and the induced electrical charge. Their influence on the gas and\nelectrode temperatures is also evidenced through optical emission spectroscopy\nand infrared imaging. It is shown that, in our configuration, the conversion\ndepends mostly on the charge delivered in the plasma and not on the effective\nplasma voltage when the applied power is modified. Similarly, at constant total\ncurrent, a better conversion is observed at low frequencies, where a less\nfilamentary discharge regime with a higher effective plasma voltage than that\nat a higher frequency is obtained.\n", "  Micro hollow cathode discharges (MHCD) were produced using 250 m thick\ndielectric layer of alumina sandwiched between two nickel electrodes of 8 m\nthickness. A through cavity at the center of the chip was formed by laser\ndrilling technique. MHCD with a diameter of few hundreds of micrometers allowed\nus to generate direct current discharges in helium at up to atmospheric\npressure. A slowly varying ramped voltage generator was used to study the\nignition and the extinction periods of the microdischarges. The analysis was\nperformed by using electrical characterisation of the V-I behaviour and the\nmeasurement of He*(3S1) metastable atoms density by tunable diode laser\nspectroscopy. At the ignition of the microdischarges, 2 s long current peak as\nhigh as 24 mA was observed, sometimes followed by low amplitude damped\noscillations. At helium pressure above 400 Torr, an oscillatory behaviour of\nthe discharge current was observed just before the extinction of the\nmicrodischarges. The same type of instability in the extinction period at high\npressure also appeared on the density of He*(3S1) metastable atoms, but delayed\nby a few s relative to the current oscillations. Metastable atoms thus cannot\nbe at the origin of the generation of the observed instabilities.\n", "  The available diagnostics for atmospheric micro-plasmas remain limited and\nrelatively complex to implement; so we present a radio-frequency technique for\ndiagnosing a key parameter here. The technique allows one to estimate the\ndependencies of the electron density by measuring the RF-impedance of the\nmicro-plasma and analyzing it with an appropriate equivalent circuit. This\ntechnique is inexpensive, can be used in real time and gives reasonable results\nfor argon and helium DC micro-plasmas in holes over a wide pressure range. The\nelectron density increases linearly with current in the expected range\nconsistent with normal glow discharge behavior.\n", "  The reactivity of water vapor introduced in an atmospheric dielectric barrier\ndischarge supplied in argon is investigated through optical emission\nspectroscopy measurements. This discharge is also used for the treatment of\nLDPE surfaces. Water contact angles measurements, XPS and AFM techniques are\nused to study the grafting of oxygen functions on the LDPE surface and increase\nits hydrophilicity.\n", "  The influence of ambient air on the flowing afterglow of an atmospheric\npressure Ar/O2 radiofrequency plasma has been investigated experimentally.\nSpatially resolved mass spectrometry and laser induced fluorescence on OH\nradicals were used to estimate the intrusion of air in between the plasma torch\nand the substrate as a function of the torch-to-substrate separation distance.\nNo air is detected, within the limits of measurement uncertainties, for\nseparation distances smaller than 5 mm. For larger distances, the effect of\nambient air can no longer be neglected, and radial gradients in the\nconcentrations of species appear. The Ar 4p population, determined through\nabsolute optical emission spectroscopy, is seen to decrease with separation\ndistance, whereas a rise in emission from the N2(C--B) system is measured. The\nobserved decay in Ar 4p and N2(C) populations for separation distances greater\nthan 9mm is partly assigned to the increasing collisional quenching rate by N2\nand O2 molecules from the entrained air. Absorption measurements also point to\nthe formation of ozone at concentrations from 10^14 to 10^15 cm-3, depending\nboth on the injected O2 flow rate and the torch-to-substrate separation\ndistance.\n", "  The in-depth oxygen diffusion into a low density polyethylene film is\nperformed in the post-discharge of an atmospheric plasma torch, supplied in\nargon as carrier gas and with or without oxygen as reactive gas. The chemical\nand structural properties of the polymer surface and bulk are studied in terms\nof plasma parameters (treatment time, power, and reactive gas flow rate). A\ngood correlation between XPS and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy\nanalyses is demonstrated. The penetration depth of oxygen into the bulk of the\npolymer is investigated by angle resolved-XPS and time-of-flight SIMS. It is\nshown that, depending on the plasma conditions, oxygen could penetrate up to\n20--40 nm into the low density polyethylene during the atmospheric plasma\ntreatment.\n", "  Parallel Micro Hollow Cathodes Discharges are characterised by electrical and\nspectroscopic studies and by using an ICCD camera. V-I curves present a\nhysteresis cycle between Townsend and normal glow regimes. For I d =4-10mA, gas\ntemperature ranges between 300-500{\\textdegree}C. When the diameter of a hole\ndecreases, a more significant discharge voltage is needed.\n", "  An atmospheric plasma torch has been supplied with a gaseous mixture of\nhelium, water vapour and/or oxygen to study the production of reactive species\nwithin its flowing post-discharge, in particular hydrogen peroxide. The\nmechanisms responsible for the production of H2O2 have been investigated by\ncorrelating measurements of mass spectrometry and absorption photospectrometry.\nAn absolute quantification of H2O2 has also been achieved and indicated that\nfor 5 mmol of water vapour injected in the He-H2O discharge, approximately 9.5\nmol of H2O2 were produced in post-discharge.\n", "  The Precision IceCube Next Generation Upgrade (PINGU) is a proposed extension\nto the IceCube detector. The design of PINGU would augment the existing 86\nstrings with an additional 40 with the main goal of determining the neutrino\nmass ordering (NMO). Preliminary studies of the NMO can start with\nIceCube/DeepCore, a sub-array of more densely- packed strings in operation\nsince 2011. This detector has a neutrino energy threshold of roughly 10 GeV and\nallows for high-statistics datasets of atmospheric neutrinos to be collected.\nThis data provides a unique opportunity to better understand the systematic\neffects involved in making the NMO measurement by comparing the simulation\nstudies to real data. These proceedings will present the current status of\nthese studies in Monte Carlo simulations with projected DeepCore sensitivity\nfor the NMO.\n", "  We report in this paper simulation results and experimental measurements to\ncharacterize a micro-discharge generated in a single micro cavity device\noperating in helium. By spatially limiting the cathode surface area using a\ndielectric layer, we demonstrate the ability of the micro-discharge to work in\na steady-state abnormal glow regime. The physical properties of this regime are\ndiscussed.\n", "  A comparative study of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) surfaces treated by the\npost-discharge of He and He-O2 plasmas at atmospheric pressure is presented.\nThe characterization of treated PTFE surfaces and the species involved in the\nsurface modification are related. In pure He plasmas, no significant change of\nthe surface has been observed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS),\ndynamic water contact angles (dWCA) and atomic force microscopy (AFM), in spite\nof important mass losses recorded. According to these observations, a\nlayer-by-layer physical etching without any preferential orientation is\nproposed, where the highly energetic helium metastables are the main species\nresponsible for the scission of --(CF2)n-- chains. In He--O 2 plasmas, as the\ndensity of helium metastables decreases as a function of the oxygen flow rate,\nthe treatment leads to fewer species ejected from the PTFE surfaces (in\nagreement with mass loss measurements and the detection of fluorinated species\nonto aluminum foil). However, the dWCA and AFM measurements show an increase in\nthe hydrophobicity and the roughness of the surface. The observed alveolar\nstructures are assumed to be caused by an anisotropic etching where the oxygen\natoms etch mainly the amorphous phase.\n", "  The post-discharge of an RF plasma torch supplied with helium and oxygen\ngases is characterized by mass spectrometry, optical emission spectroscopy and\nelectrical measurements. We have proved the existence of a dc current in the\npost-discharge (1--20 A), attributed to the Penning ionization of atmospheric\nnitrogen and oxygenated species. The mechanisms ruling this dc current are\ninvestigated through experiments in which we discuss the influence of the O2\nflow rate, the He flow rate and the distance separating the plasma torch from a\nmaterial surface located downstream.\n", "  We contribute to the understanding of social relationships within cultural\ncontexts by proposing a connection between a social theory, relational models\ntheory (RMT: Fiske 1991, 1992) and a social and political one, cultural or\nplural rationality theory (PRT: Douglas, 1982, Thompson et al., 1990). Drawing\nexamples from the literature of both theories, we argue that each relational\nmodel of RMT may be implemented in ways compatible with each cultural bias of\nPRT. A cultural bias restrains the range of congruent implementations of\nrelational models, but does not preclude any relational model altogether. This\nstands in contrast to earlier reconciliation attempts between PRT and RMT.\nBased on hypothetical one-to-one mappings, these attempts expect each cultural\nsetting to be significantly associated with some, but not all, relational\nmodels. The framework we develop helps explain the findings of these previous\nattempts and provides insights into empirical research by clarifying which\nassociations to expect between relationships and cultural contexts. We discuss\nthe theoretical basis of our framework, including the idea that RMT and PRT\napply to different levels of analysis: RMT's relational models are tied to\nrelationships between two actors and PRT's cultural biases to structures of\nsocial networks.\n", "  The present work studies the influence of laser frequency drifts on operating\nof phase-sensitive optical time-domain reflectometry ($\\Phi$-OTDR) fiber\nsensors. A mathematical model and numerical simulations are employed to\nhighlight the influence of frequency drifts of light sources on two\ncharacteristic scales: large-time (minutes) and short-time (milliseconds)\nfrequency drifts. Numerical simulation results are compared with predictions\ngiven by the fluctuation ratio coefficient (FRC), and they are in a qualitative\nagreement. In addition to qualitative criteria for light sources given by the\nFRC, quantitive requirements for optimal light sources for $\\Phi$-OTDR sensors\nare obtained. Numerical simulation results are verified by comparison with\nexperimental data for three significantly different types of light source.\n", "  A major goal of many spectroscopic techniques is to provide comprehensive\ninformation on the local chemical environment. Electron transfer mediated decay\n(ETMD) is a sensitive probe of the environment since it is actively involved in\nthis non-local radiationless decay process through electron and energy transfer\nsteps. We report the first experimental observation of ETMD in the liquid\nphase. Using liquid-jet X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy we explore LiCl\naqueous solution, and detect low-energy electrons unambiguously emerging from\nthe ETMD processes of core-ionized Li+. We interpret the experimental results\nwith molecular dynamics and high-level ab initio calculations. By considering\nvarious solvation-structure models we show that both water molecules and Cl-\nanions can participate in ETMD, with each process having its characteristic\nspectral fingerprint. Different ion associations lead to different spectral\nshapes. The potential application of the unique sensitivity of the ETMD\nspectroscopy to the local hydration structure and ion pairing is discussed.\n", "  Efforts to understand and map the possible explanations for the late time\nacceleration of the universe have led to a broad range of suggestions, ranging\nfrom the cosmological constant and straightforward dark energy, to exotically\ncoupled models, to infrared modifications of General Relativity. If we are to\nuncover which, if any, of these approaches might provide a serious answer to\nthe problem, it is crucial to understand the constraints that theoretical\nconsistency places on the models, and on the regimes in which they make\npredictions. In this talk, delivered as an invited plenary lecture at the Dark\nSide of the Universe conference in Kyoto, Japan, I briefly describe some modern\nattempts to carry out this program and some of the more interesting ideas that\nhave emerged. As an example, I use the Galileon model, discussing how the\nVainshtein mechanism occurs, and how a number of these theoretical problems\narise around such backgrounds.\n", "  Seven new solutions to the interior static and spherically symmetric\nEinstein's field equations (EFE) are found and investigated. These new\nsolutions are a generalisation of the quadratic density fall-off profile of the\nTolman VII solution. The generalisation involves the addition of anisotropic\npressures and electric charge to the density profile. Of these new solutions\nthree are found to obey all the necessary conditions of physical acceptability,\nincluding linear stability under radial perturbations, and causality of the\nspeed of pressure waves inside the object. Additionally an equation of state\ncan be found for all the physically viable solutions. The generalised pulsation\nequation for interior solutions to the EFE that include both electric charge\nand pressure anisotropy is derived and used to determine the stability of the\nsolutions. However the pulsation equation found is general and can be used for\nall new solutions that contain these ingredients.\n", "  We have studied the electronic and magnetic properties of double perovskites\nGd2MgIrO6 by first-principles density functional theory (DFT). Based on the DFT\ncalculations, Gd2MgIrO6 is found to have a ferromagnetic (FM) ground state. The\nmaterial undergo half-metallic ferromagnets to Mott-Hubbard insulator\ntransition which happens due to strong correlation in Gd-4f and Ir-5d states.\nOur results shows that the 5d electrons of Ir hybridize strongly with O-2p\nstates near the Fermi level giving rise to the insulating state of Gd2MgIrO6.\nOur study suggests that the enhanced magnetic moment is a result of itinerant\nexchange rather than the exchange interaction involving individual ions of Gd\nand Ir atoms. The total magnetic moment calculated in the present studies is 15\n{\\mu}B per formula unit for Gd2MgIrO6.\n", "  We report detailed Seebeck coefficient, Hall resistivity as well as specific\nheat measurement on Ca$_3$Ir$_4$Sn$_{13}$ single crystals. The Seebeck\ncoefficient exhibits a peak corresponding to the anomaly in resistivity at\n$T^*$, and the carrier density is suppressed significantly below $T^*$. This\nindicates a significant Fermi surface reconstruction and the opening of the\ncharge density wave gap at the supperlattice transition. The magnetic field\ninduced enhancement of the residual specific heat coefficient $\\gamma(H)$\nexhibits a nearly linear dependence on magnetic field, indicating a nodeless\ngap. In the temperature range close to $T_c$ the Seebeck coefficient can be\ndescribed well by the diffusion model. The zero-temperature extrapolated\nthermoelectric power is very small, implying large normalized Fermi\ntemperature. Consequently the ratio $\\frac{T_c}{T_F}$ is very small. Our\nresults indicate that Ca$_3$Ir$_4$Sn$_{13}$ is a weakly correlated nodeless\nsuperconductor.\n", "  The evolution and spatial structure of displacement fronts in fractures with\nself-affine rough walls are studied by numerical simulations. The fractures are\nopen and the two faces are identical but shifted along their mean plane, either\nparallel or perpendicular to the flow. An initially flat front advected by the\nflow is progressively distorted into a self-affine front with Hurst exponent\nequal to that of the fracture walls. The lower cutoff of the self-affine regime\ndepends on the aperture and lateral shift, while the upper cutoff grows\nlinearly with the width of the front.\n", "  Motivated by the recent experimental discoveries of multi-quark candidates,\ne.g., the $\\Theta^+(1540)$, we study multi-quark systems in lattice QCD. First,\nwe perform accurate mass measurements of low-lying 5Q states with $J=1/2$ and\nI=0 in both positive- and negative-parity channels in anisotropic lattice QCD.\nThe lowest positive-parity 5Q state is found to have a large mass of about\n2.24GeV after the chiral extrapolation. To single out the compact 5Q state from\n$NK$ scattering states, we develop a new method with the hybrid-boundary\ncondition (HBC), and find no evidence of the compact 5Q state below 1.75GeV in\nthe negative-parity channel. Second, we perform the first study of the\nmulti-quark potential in lattice QCD to clarify the inter-quark interaction in\nmulti-quark systems. The 5Q potential $V_{\\rm 5Q}$ for the QQ-${\\rm\n\\bar{Q}}$-QQ system is found to be well described by the ``OGE Coulomb plus\nmulti-Y Ansatz\": the sum of the one-gluon-exchange (OGE) Coulomb term and the\nmulti-Y-type linear term based on the flux-tube picture. The 4Q potential\n$V_{\\rm 4Q}$ for the QQ-${\\rm \\bar{Q}\\bar{Q}}$ system is also described by the\nOGE Coulomb plus multi-Y Ansatz, when QQ and $\\rm \\bar Q \\bar Q$ are well\nseparated. The 4Q system is described as a \"two-meson\" state with disconnected\nflux tubes, when the nearest quark and antiquark pair is spatially close. We\nobserve a lattice-QCD evidence for the ``flip-flop'', i.e., the flux-tube\nrecombination between the connected 4Q state and the ``two-meson'' state. On\nthe confinement mechanism, the lattice QCD results indicate the flux-tube-type\nlinear confinement in multi-quark hadrons.\n", "  Born-Infeld electrodynamics has attracted considerable interest due to its\nrelation to strings and D-branes. In this paper the gravitational perturbations\nof electrically charged black holes in Einstein-Born-Infeld gravity are\nstudied. Effective potentials for axial perturbations are derived and\ndiscussed. The quasi normal modes for the gravitational perturbations are\ncomputed using the WKB method. The modes are compared with those of the\nReissner-Nordstrom black hole. The relation of the quasi normal modes with the\nnon-linear parameter and the spherical index are also investigated. Comments on\nstability of the black hole and on future directions are made.\n"]}
