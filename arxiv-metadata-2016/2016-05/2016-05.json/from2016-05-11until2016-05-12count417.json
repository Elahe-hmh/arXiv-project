gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) based on data from\nthe second flight of the ANtarctic Impulsive Transient Antenna (ANITA). During\nthe 31 day flight of ANITA-II, 26 GRBs were recorded by Swift or Fermi. Of\nthese, we analyzed the 12 GRBs which occurred during quiet periods when the\npayload was away from anthropogenic activity. In a blind analysis, we observe 0\nevents on a total background of 0.0044 events in the combined prompt window for\nall 12 low-background bursts. We also observe 0 events from the remaining 14\nbursts. We place a 90% confidence level limit on the E^-4 prompt neutrino\nfluence of 2.5x10^17 GeV^3/cm^2 between 10^8 and 10^12 GeV from GRB090107A.\nThis is the first reported limit on the UHE neutrino fluence from GRBs above\n10^9 GeV, and the strongest limit above 10^8 GeV.\n", "  Upflows observed at the edges of active regions have been proposed as the\nsource of the slow solar wind. In the particular case of Active Region (AR)\n10942, where such an upflow has been already observed, we want to evaluate the\npart of this upflow that actually remains confined in the magnetic loops that\nconnect AR10942 to AR10943. Both active regions were visible simultaneously on\nthe solar disk and were observed by STEREO/SECCHI EUVI. Using Hinode/EIS\nspectra, we determine the Doppler shifts and densities in AR10943 and AR10942,\nin order to evaluate the mass flows. We also perform magnetic field\nextrapolations to assess the connectivity between AR10942 and AR10943. AR10943\ndisplays a persistent downflow in Fe XII. Magnetic extrapolations including\nboth ARs show that this downflow can be connected to the upflow in AR10942. We\nestimate that the mass flow received by AR10943 areas connected to AR10942\nrepresents about 18% of the mass flow from AR10942. We conclude that the\nupflows observed on the edge of active regions represent either large-scale\nloops with mass flowing along them (accounting for about one-fifth of the total\nmass flow in this example) or open magnetic field structures where the slow\nsolar wind originates.\n", "  In this work, we have tried to develop a detailed understanding of the\nphysical processes occurring in those variants of Micro Pattern Gas Detectors\n(MPGDs) that share micro hole and micro strip geometry, like GEM, MHSP and MSGC\netc. Some of the important and fundamental characteristics of these detectors\nsuch as gain, transparency, efficiency and their operational dependence on\ndifferent device parameters have been estimated following detailed numerical\nsimulation of the detector dynamics. We have used a relatively new simulation\nframework developed especially for the MPGDs that combines packages such as\nGARFIELD, neBEM, MAGBOLTZ and HEED. The results compare closely with the\navailable experimental data. This suggests the efficacy of the framework to\nmodel the intricacies of these micro-structured detectors in addition to\nproviding insight into their inherent complex dynamical processes.\n", "  We discuss a quantum counterpart, in the sense of the Berezin-Toeplitz\nquantization, of certain constraints on Poisson brackets coming from \"hard\"\nsymplectic geometry. It turns out that they can be interpreted in terms of the\nquantum noise of observables and their joint measurements in operational\nquantum mechanics. Our findings include various geometric mechanisms of quantum\nnoise production and a noise-localization uncertainty relation. The methods\ninvolve Floer theory and Poisson bracket invariants originated in function\ntheory on symplectic manifolds.\n", "  We compare the rigorous equations describing the motion of spinning test\nparticles in gravitational and electromagnetic fields, and show that if the\nMathisson-Pirani spin condition holds then exact gravito-electromagnetic\nanalogies emerge. These analogies provide a familiar formalism to treat\ngravitational problems, as well as a means for comparing the two interactions.\nFundamental differences are manifest in the symmetries and time projections of\nthe electromagnetic and gravitational tidal tensors. The physical consequences\nof the symmetries of the tidal tensors are explored comparing the following\nanalogous setups: magnetic dipoles in the field of non-spinning/spinning\ncharges, and gyroscopes in the Schwarzschild, Kerr, and Kerr-de Sitter\nspacetimes. The implications of the time projections of the tidal tensors are\nillustrated by the work done on the particle in various frames; in particular,\na reciprocity is found to exist: in a frame comoving with the particle, the\nelectromagnetic (but not the gravitational) field does work on it, causing a\nvariation of its proper mass; conversely, for \"static observers,\" a stationary\ngravitomagnetic (but not a magnetic) field does work on the particle, and the\nassociated potential energy is seen to embody the Hawking-Wald spin-spin\ninteraction energy. The issue of hidden momentum, and its counterintuitive\ndynamical implications, is also analyzed. Finally, a number of issues regarding\nthe electromagnetic interaction and the physical meaning of Dixon's equations\nare clarified.\n", "  MnxGa films with high perpendicular anisotropy, coercivity and energy product\nhave great application potential in ultrahigh-density perpendicular recording,\npermanent magnets, spin-transfer-torque memory and oscillators,\nmagneto-resistance sensors and ferromagnetic metal/semiconductor\nheterostructure devices. Here we present a comprehensive diagram of effective\nmagnetism-tailoring of perpendicularly magnetized MnxGa films grown on III-V\nsemiconductor GaAs by using molecular-beam epitaxy for the first time, by\nsystematically investigating the wide-range composition and detailed\npost-growth annealing effects. We show that the (001)-orientated MnxGa films\nwith L10 or D022 ordering could be crystallized on GaAs in a very wide\ncomposition range from x=0.76 to 2.6. L10-ordered MnxGa films show robust\nmagnetization, high remanent ratio, giant perpendicular anisotropy, high\nintrinsic and extrinsic coercivity, and large energy product, which make this\nkind of material favorable for perpendicular magnetic recording,\nhigh-performance spintronic devices and permanent magnet applications. In\ncontrast, D022-ordered films exhibit lower perpendicular anisotropy and weaker\nmagnetism. Post-growth annealing MnxGa films studies reveal high\nthermal-stability up to 450 oC, and effective tailoring of magnetic properties\ncan be realized by prolonging annealing at 450 oC. These results would be\nhelpful for understanding this kind of material and designing new spintronic\ndevices for specific practical applications.\n", "  We decompose the quantum adiabatic evolution as the products of gauge\ninvariant unitary operators and obtain the exact nonadiabatic correction in the\nadiabatic approximation. A necessary and sufficient condition that leads to\nadiabatic evolution with geometric phases is provided and we determine that in\nthe adiabatic evolution, while the eigenstates are slowly varying, the\neigenenergies and degeneracy of the Hamiltonian can change rapidly. We\nexemplify this result by the example of the adiabatic evolution driven by\nparametrized pulse sequences. For driving fields that are rotating slowly with\nthe same average energy and evolution path, fast modulation fields can have\nsmaller nonadiabatic errors than obtained under the traditional approach with a\nconstant amplitude.\n", "  In 1995, Bekenstein and Mukhanov suggested that the Hawking radiation\nspectrum was discrete if the area spectrum was quantized in such a way that the\nallowed areas were integer multiples of a single unit area. However, in 1996,\nBarreira, Carfora, and Rovelli argued that the Hawking radiation spectrum was\ncontinuous if the area spectrum was quantized with an infinite number of unit\nareas, as predicted by loop quantum gravity, rather than quantized with the\nsingle unit area considered by Bekenstein and Mukhanov. In this paper, contrary\nto what Barreira, Carfora, and Rovelli argued, we show that the Hawking\nradiation spectrum is still discrete when the area spectrum is quantized as\nloop quantum gravity predicts. In particular, we show that, for a black hole of\na given temperature, the Hawking radiation spectrum is truncated at frequencies\nbelow a certain frequency.\n", "  We derive a simple lower bound on the geometric measure of entanglement for\nmixed quantum states in the case of a general multipartite system. The main\ningredient of the presented derivation is the triangle inequality applied to\nthe root infidelity distance in the space of density matrices. The obtained\nbound leads to entanglement criteria with a straightforward interpretation.\nProposed criteria provide an experimentally accessible, powerful entanglement\ntest.\n", "  Compared with two-dimensional imaging, three-dimensional imaging is much more\nadvantageous to catch the characteristic information of the target for remote\nsensing. We report a range-resolving ghost imaging ladar system together with\nthe experimental demonstration of three-dimensional remote sensing with a large\nfield of view. The experiments show that, by measuring the correlation function\nof intensity fluctuations between two light fields, a three-dimensional map at\nabout 1.0 km range with 25 cm resolution in lateral direction and 60 cm\nresolution in axial direction has been achieved by time-resolved measurements\nof the reflection signals.\n", "  A plasma transport theory that spans weak to strong coupling is developed\nfrom a binary collision picture, but where the interaction potential is taken\nto be an effective potential that includes correlation effects and screening\nself-consistently. This physically motivated approach provides a practical\nmodel for evaluating transport coefficients across coupling regimes. The theory\nis shown to compare well with classical molecular dynamics simulations of\ntemperature relaxation in electron-ion plasmas, as well as simulations and\nexperiments of self-diffusion in one component plasmas. The approach is\nversatile and can be applied to other transport coefficients as well.\n", "  The bulk Micromegas detector is considered to be a promising candidate for\nbuilding TPCs for several future experiments including the projected linear\ncollider. The standard bulk with a spacing of 128 micron has already\nestablished itself as a good choice for its performances in terms of gas gain\nuniformity, energy and space point resolution, and its capability to\nefficiently pave large readout surfaces with minimum dead zone. The present\nwork involves the comparison of this standard bulk with a relatively less used\nbulk Micromegas detector having a larger amplification gap of 192 micron.\nDetector gain, energy resolution and electron transparency of these Micromegas\nhave been measured under different conditions in various argon based gas\nmixtures to evaluate their performance. These measured characteristics have\nalso been compared in detail to numerical simulations using the Garfield\nframework that combines packages such as neBEM, Magboltz and Heed. Further, we\nhave carried out another numerical study to determine the effect of dielectric\nspacers on different detector features. A comprehensive comparison of the two\ndetectors has been presented and analyzed in this work.\n", "  The impact of drops of concentrated non-Brownian suspensions (cornstarch and\npolystyrene spheres) onto a solid surface is investigated experimentally. The\nspreading dynamics and maxi- mal deformation of the droplet of such shear\nthickening liquids are found to be markedly different from the impact of\nNewtonian drops. A particularly striking observation is that the maximal de-\nformation is independent of the drop velocity and that the deformation suddenly\nstops during the impact phase. Both observations are due to the\nshear-thickening rheology of the suspensions, as is theoretically explained\nfrom a balance between the kinetic energy and the viscously-dissipated en-\nergy, from which we establish a scaling relation between drop maximal\ndeformation and rheological parameters of concentrated suspensions.\n", "  The solutions of stochastic differential equations without an external drift\nare stochastically invariant under time reversal. This singles out the\n\"anti-Ito\" integral.\n", "  We present a new technique to measure neutrino masses using their flow field\nrelative to dark matter. Present day streaming motions of neutrinos relative to\ndark matter and baryons are several hundred km/s, comparable with their thermal\nvelocity dispersion. This results in a unique dipole anisotropic distortion of\nthe matter-neutrino cross power spectrum, which is observable through the\ndipole distortion in the cross correlation of different galaxy populations.\nSuch a dipole vanishes if not for this relative velocity and so it is a clean\nsignature for neutrino mass. We estimate the size of this effect and find that\ncurrent and future galaxy surveys may be sensitive to these signature\ndistortions.\n", "  We derive the photon propagator in light-shell gauge, which was first\nintroduced in the context of light-shell effective theory.\n", "  Hidden states of matter with novel and unusual properties may be created if a\nsystem out of equilibrium can be induced to follow a trajectory to a state\nwhich is inaccessible or does not even exist under normal equilibrium\nconditions. Here we report on the discovery of a hidden (H) topologically\nprotected electronic state in a layered dichalcogenide 1T-TaS2 crystal reached\nas a result of a quench caused by a single 35 fs laser pulse. The properties of\nthe H state are markedly different from any other state of the system: it\nexhibits a large drop of electrical resistance, strongly modified single\nparticle and collective mode spectra and a marked change of optical\nreflectivity. Particularly important and unusual, the H state is stable for an\narbitrarily long time until a laser pulse, electrical current or thermal erase\nprocedure is applied, causing it to revert to the thermodynamic ground state.\nMajor observed events can be reproduced by a kinetic model describing the\nconversion of photo excited electrons and holes into an electronically ordered\ncrystal, thus converting a Mott insulator to a conducting H state. Its\nlong-time stability follows from the topological protection of the number of\nperiods in the electronic crystal.\n", "  SDE's must be solved in the \"anti-Ito\" sense when their coefficients are\nindependent. While the \"noise-induced drift\" matters for the sample paths, it\nis absent in the Fokker-Planck equation, which takes a particularly simple form\nand is invariant under changes of the variables. Pure noise yields martingale\nsolutions.\n", "  We present a new kit for the study of flavor observables in models beyond the\nstandard model. The setup is based on the public codes SARAH and SPheno and\nallows for an easy implementation of new observables. The Wilson coefficients\nof the corresponding operators in the effective Lagrangian are computed by\nSPheno modules written by SARAH. New operators can also be added by the user in\na modular way. For this purpose a handy Mathematica package called PreSARAH has\nbeen developed. This uses FeynArts and FormCalc to derive the generic form\nfactors at tree- and 1-loop levels and to generate the necessary input files\nfor SARAH. This framework has been used to implement BR($\\ell_\\alpha\\to\n\\ell_\\beta \\gamma$), BR($\\ell_\\alpha \\to 3\\, \\ell_\\beta$), CR($\\mu-e,A$),\nBR($\\tau \\to P \\, \\ell$), BR($h\\to \\ell_\\alpha \\ell_\\beta$), BR($Z\\to\n\\ell_\\alpha \\ell_\\beta$), BR($B_{s,d}^0 \\to \\ell \\bar{\\ell}$), BR($\\bar B \\to\nX_s\\gamma$), BR($\\bar B \\to X_s \\ell \\bar{\\ell}$), BR($\\bar B \\to X_{d,s} \\nu\n\\bar \\nu$), BR($K^+ \\to \\pi^+ \\nu \\bar \\nu$), BR($K_L \\to \\pi^0 \\nu \\bar \\nu$),\n$\\Delta M_{B_s,B_d}$, $\\Delta M_K$, $\\varepsilon_K$, BR($B \\to K \\mu\n\\bar{\\mu}$), BR($B\\to \\ell \\nu$), BR($D_s \\to \\ell \\nu$) and BR($K \\to \\ell\n\\nu$) in SARAH. Predictions for these observables can now be obtained in a wide\nrange of SUSY and non-SUSY models. Finally, the user can use the same approach\nto easily compute additional observables.\n", "  Using the non-relativistic effective field theory framework in a finite\nvolume, we discuss the extraction of the $\\Delta N\\gamma^*$ transition form\nfactors from lattice data. A counterpart of the L\\\"uscher approach for the\nmatrix elements of unstable states is formulated. In particular, we thoroughly\ndiscuss various kinematic settings, which are used in the calculation of the\nabove matrix element on the lattice. The emerging L\\\"uscher-Lellouch factor and\nthe analytic continuation of the matrix elements into the complex plane are\nalso considered in detail. A full group-theoretical analysis of the problem is\nmade, including the partial-wave mixing and projecting out the invariant form\nfactors from data.\n", "  Using projections on the (generalized) eigenvectors associated to matrices\nthat characterize the topological structure, several authors have constructed\ngeneralizations of the Fourier transform on graphs. By exploring mappings of\nthe spectrum of these matrices we show how to construct more general\ntransforms, in particular wavelet-like transforms on graphs. For time-series,\ntomograms, a generalization of the Radon transforms to arbitrary pairs of\nnon-commuting operators, are positive bilinear transforms with a rigorous\nprobabilistic interpretation which provide a full characterization of the\nsignals and are robust in the presence of noise. Here the notion of tomogram\ntransform is also extended to signals on arbitrary graphs\n", "  Using the optimal velocity (OV) model as an example, we show that in the\nnon-linear regime there is an emergent quantity that gives the extremum\nheadways in the cluster formation, as well as the coexistence curve separating\nthe absolute stable phase from the metastable phase. This emergent quantity is\nindependent of the density of the traffic lane, and determines an intrinsic\nscale that characterizes the dynamics of localized quasisoliton structures\ngiven by the time derivative of the headways. The intrinsic scale is analogous\nto the \"charge\" of quasisolitons that controls the strength of interaction\nbetween multiple clusters, leading to non-trivial cluster statistics from\nrandom perturbations to initial uniform traffic. The cluster statistics depend\nboth on the charge and the density of the traffic lane; the relationship is\nqualitatively universal for general car-following models.\n", "  We calculate the mass of the Higgs boson in the Standard Model in terms of\nthe underlying Lagrangian parameters at complete 2-loop order with leading\n3-loop corrections. A computer program implementing the results is provided.\nThe program also computes and minimizes the Standard Model effective potential\nin Landau gauge at 2-loop order with leading 3-loop corrections.\n", "  This work introduces optimization strategies to continuous variable\nmeasurement based quantum computation (MBQC) at different levels. We provide a\nrecipe for mitigating the effects of finite squeezing, which affect the\nproduction of cluster states and the result of a traditional MBQC. These\nstrategies are readily implementable by several experimental groups.\nFurthermore, a more general scheme for MBQC is introduced that does not\nnecessarily rely on the use of ancillary cluster states to achieve its aim, but\nrather on the detection of a resource state in a suitable mode basis followed\nby digital post-processing. A recipe is provided to optimize the adjustable\nparameters that are employed within this framework.\n", "  Considering the neutrino state like an open quantum system, we analyze its\npropagation in vacuum or in matter. After defining what can be called\ndecoherence and relaxation effects, we show that in general the probabilities\nin vacuum and in constant matter can be written in a similar way, which is not\nan obvious result in this approach. From this result, we analyze the situation\nwhere neutrinos evolution satisfies the adiabatic limit and use this formalim\nto study solar neutrinos. We show that the decoherence effect may not be\nbounded by the solar neutrino data and review some results in the literature.\nWe discuss the current results where solar neutrinos were used to put bounds on\ndecoherence effects through a model-dependent approach. We conclude explaining\nhow and why this models are not general and we reinterpret these constraints.\n", "  In this paper, we have investigated the thermodynamics of Schwarzschild black\nholes using the symmetric generalized uncertainty principle which contains\ncorrection terms involving momentum and position uncertainty. We obtain the\nmass-temperature relation and the heat capacity of the black hole using which\nwe compute the critical and remnant masses. The entropy is found to satisfy the\narea law upto leading order corrections from the symmetric generalized\nuncertainty principle.\n", "  The examination of the physical properties of chondrules has generally\nreceived less emphasis than other properties of meteorites such as their\nmineralogy, petrology, and chemical and isotopic compositions. Among the\nvarious physical properties of chondrules, chondrule size is especially\nimportant for the classification of chondrites into chemical groups, since each\nchemical group possesses a distinct size-frequency distribution of chondrules.\nKnowledge of the physical properties of chondrules is also vital for the\ndevelopment of astrophysical models for chondrule formation, and for\nunderstanding how to utilize asteroidal resources in space exploration. To\nexamine our current knowledge of chondrule sizes, we have compiled and provide\ncommentary on available chondrule dimension literature data. We include all\nchondrite chemical groups as well as the acapulcoite primitive achondrites,\nsome of which contain relict chondrules. We also compile and review current\nliterature data for other astrophysically-relevant physical properties\n(chondrule mass and density). Finally, we briefly examine some additional\nphysical aspects of chondrules such as the frequencies of compound and\n'cratered' chondrules. A purpose of this compilation is to provide a useful\nresource for meteoriticists and astrophysicists alike.\n", "  Tensor network techniques have proved to be powerful tools that can be\nemployed to explore the large scale dynamics of lattice systems. Nonetheless,\nthe redundancy of degrees of freedom in lattice gauge theories (and related\nmodels) poses a challenge for standard tensor network algorithms. We\naccommodate for such systems by introducing an additional structure decorating\nthe tensor network. This allows to explicitly preserve the gauge symmetry of\nthe system under coarse graining and straightforwardly interpret the fixed\npoint tensors. We propose and test (for models with finite Abelian groups) a\ncoarse graining algorithm for lattice gauge theories based on decorated tensor\nnetworks. We also point out that decorated tensor networks are applicable to\nother models as well, where they provide the advantage to give immediate access\nto certain expectation values and correlation functions.\n", "  We study a class of translational-invariant insulators with discrete\nrotational symmetry. These insulators have no spin-orbit coupling, and in some\ncases have no time-reversal symmetry as well, i.e., the relevant symmetries are\npurely crystalline. Nevertheless, topological phases exist which are\ndistinguished by their robust surface modes. Like many well-known topological\nphases, their band topology is unveiled by the crystalline analog of Berry\nphases, i.e., parallel transport across certain non-contractible loops in the\nBrillouin zone. We also identify certain topological phases without any robust\nsurface modes -- they are uniquely distinguished by parallel transport along\nbent loops, whose shapes are determined by the symmetry group. Our findings\nhave experimental implications in cold-atom systems, where the crystalline\nBerry phase has been directly measured.\n", "  The functionality of logic and memory elements in current electronics is\nbased on multi-stability, driven either by manipulating local concentrations of\nelectrons in transistors, or by switching between equivalent states of a\nmaterial with a degener- ate ground state in magnetic or ferroelectric\nmaterials. Another possibility is offered by phase transitions with switching\nbetween metallic and insulating phases, but classical phase transitions are\nlimited in speed by slow nucleation, proliferation of domains and hysteresis.\nWe can in principle avoid these problems by using quantum states for switching,\nbut microscopic systems suffer from decoherence which prohibits their use in\neveryday devices. Macroscopic quantum states, such as the superconducting\nground state have the advantage that on a fundamental level they do not suffer\nfrom decoherence plaguing microscopic systems. Here we demonstrate for the\nfirst time ultrafast non-thermal switching between different metastable\nelectronically ordered states by pulsed electrical charge injection. The\nmacroscopic nature of the many-body quantum states(1-4) - which are not part of\nthe equilibrium phase diagram - gives rise to unprecedented stability and\nremarka- bly sharp switching thresholds. Fast sub-50 ps switching, large\nassociated re- sistance changes, 2-terminal operation and demonstrable high\nfidelity of bi-stability control suggest new opportunities for the use of\nmacroscopic quantum states in electronics, particularly for an ultrafast\nnon-volatile quantum charge-order resistive random access memory (QCOR-RAM).\n", "  Time reversal methods are widely used to achieve wave focusing in acoustics\nand electromagnetics. A typical time reversal experiment requires that a\ntransmitter be initially present at the target focusing point, which limits the\napplication of this technique. In this paper, we propose a method to focus\nwaves at an arbitary location inside a complex enclosure using a numerically\ncalculated wave excitation signal. We use a semi-classical ray algorithm to\ncalculate the signal that would be received at a transceiver port resulting\nfrom the injection of a short pulse at the desired target location. The\ntime-reversed version of this signal is then injected into the transceiver port\nand an approximate reconstruction of the short pulse is created at the target.\nThe quaility of the pulse reconstruction is quantified in three different ways\nand the values of these metrics are predicted by the statistics of the\nscattering-parameter $|S_{21}|^2$ between the transceiver and target points in\nthe enclosure. We experimentally demonstrate the method using a flat microwave\nbilliard and quantify the reconstruction quality as a function of enclosure\nloss, port coupling and other considerations.\n", "  A degenerate variant of mean field perturbation theory for the on-site\nBose-Hubbard Hamiltonian is presented. We split the perturbation into two terms\nand perform exact diagonalization in the two-dimensional subspace corresponding\nto the degenerate states. The final relations for the second order ground state\nenergy and first order wave function do not contain singularities at integer\nvalues of the chemical potentials. The resulting equation for the phase\nboundary between superfluid and Mott states coincides with the prediction based\non the conventional mean field perturbation approach.\n", "  We show that superconductivity can arise in semiconductors with a band in the\nshape of a Mexican hat when the chemical potential is tuned close to the band\nedge, but not intersecting the band, as long as interactions are sufficiently\nstrong. Hence, this is an example where superconductivity can emerge from a\nband insulator when interactions exceed a threshold. Semiconductors with simple\ncubic symmetry point groups and with strong spin-orbit coupling provide an\nexample of a system with such band dispersion.\n", "  A multi-channel algebraic scattering (MCAS) method has been used to solve\ncoupled sets of Lippmann-Schwinger equations for $\\alpha$+nucleus systems to\nfind spectra of the compound systems. Low energy spectra for ${}^{12}$C,\n${}^{16}$O, and ${}^{20}$Ne are found with the systems considered as the\ncoupling of an $\\alpha$ particle with low-excitation states of the core nuclei,\n${}^8$Be, ${}^{12}$C, and ${}^{16}$O, respectively. Collective models have been\nused to define the matrices of interacting potentials. Quadrupole (and octupole\nwhen relevant) deformation is allowed and taken to second order. The\ncalculations also require a small monopole interaction to provide an extra\nenergy gap commensurate with an effect of strong pairing forces. The results\ncompare reasonably well with known spectra given the simple collective model\nprescriptions taken for the coupled-channel interactions. Improvement of those\ninteraction specifics in the approach will give spectra and wave functions\nsuitable for use in analyses of cross sections for $\\alpha$ scattering and\ncapture by light-mass nuclei; reactions of great importance in nuclear\nastrophysics.\n", "  Quantum transport in disordered systems is studied using a polaron-based\nmaster equation. The polaron approach is capable of bridging the results from\nthe coherent band-like transport regime governed by the Redfield equation to\nincoherent hopping transport in the classical regime. A non-monotonic\ndependence of the diffusion coefficient is observed both as a function of\ntemperature and system-phonon coupling strength. In the band-like transport\nregime, the diffusion coefficient is shown to be linearly proportional to the\nsystem-phonon coupling strength, and vanishes at zero coupling due to Anderson\nlocalization. In the opposite classical hopping regime, we correctly recover\nthat the dynamics are described by the Fermi's Golden Rule (FGR) and establish\nthat the scaling of the diffusion coefficient depends on the phonon bath\nrelaxation time. In both the hopping and band-like transport regimes, it is\ndemonstrated that at low temperature the zero-point fluctuations of the bath\nlead to non-zero transport rates, and hence a finite diffusion constant.\nApplication to rubrene and other organic semiconductor materials shows a good\nagreement with experimental mobility data.\n", "  We present a new channel of the neutrinoless double beta decay. In this\nscenario neutrinos not only oscillate inside the nucleus but also interact with\nan external non-uniform magnetic field. We assume that the field rotates about\nthe direction of motion of the neutrino and show, that for a certain speed of\nrotation the half-life of the $0\\nu2\\beta$ decay may be significantly lowered.\n", "  Magnetic skyrmions are topologically non-trivial spin textures of potential\ninterest for future information storage applications, and for such purposes,\nthe control and understanding of single skyrmion creation is required. A scheme\nis analyzed to create single N\\'{e}el-type and Bloch-type skyrmions in\nhelimagnetic thin films utilizing the dynamical excitations induced by the\nOersted field and the spin transfer torque given by a vertically injected\nspin-polarized current. A topological charge analysis using a lattice version\nof the topological charge provides insight into the locally triggered\ntransition from a trivial to a non-trivial topological spin texture of the\nN\\'{e}el or Bloch type skyrmion. The topological protection of the magnetic\nskyrmion is determined by the symmetric Heisenberg exchange energy. The\ncritical switching current density is $\\sim10^{7}\\thinspace\\textrm{A/cm}^{2}$,\nwhich decreases with the easy-plane type uniaxial anisotropy and thermal\nfluctuations. In-plane spin polarization of the injected current performs\nbetter than out-of-plane polarization, and it provides ultrafast switching\ntimes (within 100 ps) and reliable switching outcomes.\n", "  The relic neutrinos are expected to acquire a bulk relative velocity with\nrespect to the dark matter at low redshifts, and neutrino wakes are expected to\ndevelop downstream of the dark matter halos. We propose a method of measuring\nthe neutrino mass based on this mechanism. This neutrino wake will cause a\ndipole distortion of the galaxy-galaxy lensing pattern. This effect could be\ndetected by combining upcoming lensing surveys with a low redshift galaxy\nsurvey or a 21 cm intensity mapping survey, which can map the neutrino flow\nfield. The data obtained with LSST and Euclid should enable us to make a\npositive detection if the three neutrino masses are quasidegenerate with each\nneutrino mass of $\\sim$0.1 eV, and a future high precision 21 cm lensing survey\nwould allow the normal hierarchy and inverted hierarchy cases to be\ndistinguished, and even the right-handed Dirac neutrinos may be detectable.\n", "  As well known, Boltzmann-Gibbs statistics is the correct way of\nthermostatistically approaching ergodic systems. On the other hand, nontrivial\nergodicity breakdown and strong correlations typically drag the system into\nout-of-equilibrium states where Boltzmann-Gibbs statistics fails. For a wide\nclass of such systems, it has been shown in recent years that the correct\napproach is to use Tsallis statistics instead. Here we show how the dynamics of\nthe paradigmatic conservative (area-preserving) standard map exhibits, in an\nexceptionally clear manner, the crossing from one statistics to the other. Our\nresults unambiguously illustrate the domains of validity of both\nBoltzmann-Gibbs and Tsallis statistics.\n", "  We calculate the $\\rho$ meson couplings between the heavy hybrid doublets\nH^h/S^h/M^h/T^h and the ordinary q\\bar{Q} doublets in the framework of the\nlight-cone QCD sum rule. The sum rules obtained rely mildly on the Borel\nparameters in their working regions. The resulting coupling constants are\nrather small in most cases.\n", "  Stabilizing, by deformation, the algebra of relativistic quantum mechanics a\nnon-commutative space-time geometry is obtained. The exterior algebra of this\ngeometry leads to an extended massless Dirac equation which has both a massless\nand a large mass solution. The nature of the solutions is discussed, as well as\nthe effects of coupling the two solutions.\n", "  We present a novel approach to handle ring artifacts correction in compressed\nsensing tomographic reconstruction. The correction is part of the\nreconstruction process, which differs from classical sinogram pre-processing\nand image post-processing techniques. The principle of compressed sensing\ntomographic reconstruction is presented. Then, we show that the ring artifacts\ncorrection can be integrated in the reconstruction problem formalism. We\nprovide numerical results for both simulated and real data. This technique is\nincluded in the PyHST2 code which is used at the European Synchrotron Radiation\nFacility for tomographic reconstruction.\n", "  In Kleinberg's small-world network model, strong ties are modeled as\ndeterministic edges in the underlying base grid and weak ties are modeled as\nrandom edges connecting remote nodes. The probability of connecting a node $u$\nwith node $v$ through a weak tie is proportional to $1/|uv|^\\alpha$, where\n$|uv|$ is the grid distance between $u$ and $v$ and $\\alpha\\ge 0$ is the\nparameter of the model. Complex contagion refers to the propagation mechanism\nin a network where each node is activated only after $k \\ge 2$ neighbors of the\nnode are activated.\n  In this paper, we propose the concept of routing of complex contagion (or\ncomplex routing), where we can activate one node at one time step with the goal\nof activating the targeted node in the end. We consider decentralized routing\nscheme where only the weak ties from the activated nodes are revealed. We study\nthe routing time of complex contagion and compare the result with simple\nrouting and complex diffusion (the diffusion of complex contagion, where all\nnodes that could be activated are activated immediately in the same step with\nthe goal of activating all nodes in the end).\n  We show that for decentralized complex routing, the routing time is lower\nbounded by a polynomial in $n$ (the number of nodes in the network) for all\nrange of $\\alpha$ both in expectation and with high probability (in particular,\n$\\Omega(n^{\\frac{1}{\\alpha+2}})$ for $\\alpha \\le 2$ and\n$\\Omega(n^{\\frac{\\alpha}{2(\\alpha+2)}})$ for $\\alpha > 2$ in expectation),\nwhile the routing time of simple contagion has polylogarithmic upper bound when\n$\\alpha = 2$. Our results indicate that complex routing is harder than complex\ndiffusion and the routing time of complex contagion differs exponentially\ncompared to simple contagion at sweetspot.\n", "  By breaking the inversion symmetry of the three-dimensional Dirac metal\nNa$_3$Bi, we realize topological insulator (TI) phases in the known compound\nNaBaBi using $ab~initio$ calculations. Two distinct TI phases emerge: one phase\nis due to band inversion between the Bi $p$ and Na $s$ bands, and the other\nphase (under pressure) is induced by inversion of the Bi $p$ and Ba $d$ bands.\nBoth phases exhibit Dirac-cone-type surface states, but they have opposite spin\ntextures. In the upper cone, a left-handed spin texture exists for the $s$-$p$\ninverted phase (similar to a common TI, e.g., Bi$_2$Se$_3$), whereas a\nright-handed spin texture appears for the $p$-$d$ inverted phase. NaBaBi\npresents a prototype model of a TI that exhibits different spin textures in the\nsame material. In addition, NaBaBi may exhibit the introduction of correlation\neffects to the topological state owing to the existence of $d$ states in the\nband inversion.\n", "  The detection of high energy neutrinos ($10^{15}-10^{20}$ eV or $1-10^{5}$\nPeV) is an important step toward understanding the most energetic cosmic\naccelerators and would enable tests of fundamental physics at energy scales\nthat cannot easily be achieved on Earth. In this energy range, there are two\nexpected populations of neutrinos: the astrophysical flux observed with IceCube\nat lower energies ($\\sim1$ PeV) and the predicted cosmogenic flux at higher\nenergies ($\\sim10^{18}$ eV). Radio detector arrays such as RICE, ANITA, ARA,\nand ARIANNA exploit the Askaryan effect and the radio transparency of glacial\nice, which together enable enormous volumes of ice to be monitored with sparse\ninstrumentation. We describe here the design for a phased radio array that\nwould lower the energy threshold of radio techniques to the PeV scale, allowing\nmeasurement of the astrophysical flux observed with IceCube over an extended\nenergy range. Meaningful energy overlap with optical Cherenkov telescopes could\nbe used for energy calibration. The phased radio array design would also\nprovide more efficient coverage of the large effective volume required to\ndiscover cosmogenic neutrinos.\n", "  The interaction of shear bands with crystalline nanoprecipitates in\nCu-Zr-based metallic glasses is investigated by a combination of\nhigh-resolution TEM imaging and molecular-dynamics computer simulations. Our\nresults reveal different interaction mechanisms: Shear bands can dissolve\nprecipitates, can wrap around crystalline obstacles, or can be blocked\ndepending on size and density of the precipitates. If the crystalline phase has\na low yield strength, we also observe slip transfer through the precipitate.\nBased on the computational results and experimental findings, a qualitative\nmechanism map is proposed that categorizes the various processes as a function\nof the critical stress for dislocation nucleation, precipitate size, and\ndistance.\n", "  Quantum nonlocality and contextuality are two phenomena stemming from\nnonclassical correlations. Whereas the former requires entanglement that is\nconsumed in the measurement process the latter can occur for any state if one\nchooses a proper set of measurements. Despite this stark differences\nexperimental tests of both phenomena were similar so far. For each run of the\nexperiment one had to use a different copy of a physical system prepared\naccording to the same procedure, or the system had to be brought to its initial\nstate. Here we show that this is not necessary and that the state-independent\ncontextuality can be manifested in a scenario in which each measurement round\nis done on an output state from the previous round.\n", "  Rezzolla et al. [ApJ 531 (2000), L139; Phys. Rev. D 64 (2001), 104013; Phys.\nRev. D 64 (2001), 104014] draw attention to the second order secular drift\nassociated with r-modes and claimed that it should lead to magnetic field\nenhancement and suppression of r-mode instability in magnetized neutron stars.\nWe critically revise these results. We present a particular second order r-mode\nsolution with vanishing secular drift, thus refuting a widely believed\nstatement that secular drift is an unavoidable feature of r-modes. This\nnon-drifting solution is not affected by magnetic field $B$, if $B\\ll\nB_{\\mathrm{crit}}\\approx 10^{17}\\,(\\nu/600\\,\\mathrm{Hz})$ G ($\\nu$ is a spin\nfrequency) and does not lead to secular evolution of magnetic field. For\ngeneral second order r-mode solution the drift does not necessarily vanish, but\nthe solution can be presented as a superposition of two solutions: one\ndescribes evolution of differential rotation in nonoscillating star (which\ndescribes secular drift; for nonmagnetized star it is arbitrary stationary\nrotation stratified on cylinders; for magnetized star differential rotation\nevolves on the Alfv\\'{e}n timescale and may lead to magnetic energy\nenhancement), and another one is non-drifting r-mode solution mentioned above.\nThis representation allows us to conclude that enhancement of magnetic field\nenergy is limited by initial energy of differential rotation, which is much\nless (for a factor $\\propto \\alpha^2$, where $\\alpha$ is mode amplitude) than\nthe total energy of r-mode. Hence, magnetic field enhancement by drift cannot\nsuppress r-mode instability. Results can be generalized for any oscillation\nmode in any medium, if this mode has non-drifting solution for $B=0$.\n", "  Blind quantum computation (BQC) allows a client (Alice), who only possesses\nrelatively poor quantum devices, to delegate universal quantum computation to a\nserver (Bob) in such a way that Bob cannot know Alice's inputs, algorithm, and\noutputs. The quantum channel between Alice and Bob is noisy, and the loss over\nthe long-distance quantum communication should also be taken into account. Here\nwe propose to use decoherence-free subspace (DFS) to overcome the collective\nnoise in the quantum channel for BQC, which we call DFS-BQC. We propose three\nvariations of DFS-BQC protocols. One of them, a coherent-light-assisted DFS-BQC\nprotocol, allows Alice to faithfully send the signal photons with a probability\nproportional to a transmission rate of the quantum channel. In all cases, we\ncombine the ideas based on DFS and the Broadbent-Fitzsimons-Kashefi protocol,\nwhich is one of the BQC protocols, without degrading unconditional security.\nThe proposed DFS-based schemes are generic and hence can be applied to other\nBQC protocols where Alice sends quantum states to Bob.\n", "  We present an optimized variant of the halo model, designed to produce\naccurate matter power spectra well into the non-linear regime for a wide range\nof cosmological models. To do this, we introduce physically motivated free\nparameters into the halo-model formalism and fit these to data from\nhigh-resolution $N$-body simulations. For a variety of $\\Lambda$CDM and $w$CDM\nmodels the halo-model power is accurate to $\\simeq 5$ per cent for $k\\leq\n10h\\,\\mathrm{Mpc}$ and $z\\leq 2$. An advantage of our new halo model is that it\ncan be adapted to account for the effects of baryonic feedback on the power\nspectrum. We demonstrate this by fitting the halo model to power spectra from\nthe OWLS hydrodynamical simulation suite via parameters that govern halo\ninternal structure. We are able to fit all feedback models investigated at the\n5 per cent level using only two free parameters, and we place limits on the\nrange of these halo parameters for feedback models investigated by the OWLS\nsimulations. Accurate predictions to high-$k$ are vital for weak lensing\nsurveys, and these halo parameters could be considered nuisance parameters to\nmarginalize over in future analyses to mitigate uncertainty regarding the\ndetails of feedback. Finally, we investigate how lensing observables predicted\nby our model compare to those from simulations and from HALOFIT for a range of\n$k$-cuts and feedback models and quantify the angular scales at which these\neffects become important. Code to calculate power spectra from the model\npresented in this paper can be found at\nhttps://github.com/alexander-mead/hmcode\n", "  Periodically driven quantum systems provide a novel and versatile platform\nfor realizing topological phenomena. Among these are analogs of topological\ninsulators and superconductors, attainable in static systems; however, some of\nthese phenomena are unique to the periodically driven case. Here, we show that\ndisordered, periodically driven systems admit an \"anomalous\" two dimensional\nphase, whose quasi-energy spectrum consists of chiral edge modes that coexist\nwith a fully localized bulk - an impossibility for static Hamiltonians. This\nunique situation serves as the basis for a new topologically-protected\nnon-equilibrium transport phenomenon: quantized non-adiabatic charge pumping.\nWe identify the bulk topological invariant that characterizes the new phase\n(which we call the \"anomalous Floquet Anderson Insulator\", or AFAI). We provide\nexplicit models which constitute a proof of principle for the existence of the\nnew phase. Finally, we present evidence that the disorder-driven transition\nfrom the AFAI to a trivial, fully localized phase is in the same universality\nclass as the quantum Hall plateau transition.\n", "  Bayesian procedures designed to quantify truncation errors in perturbative\ncalculations of quantum chromodynamics observables are adapted to expansions in\neffective field theory (EFT). In the Bayesian approach, such truncation errors\nare derived from degree-of-belief (DOB) intervals for EFT predictions.\nComputation of these intervals requires specification of prior probability\ndistributions (\"priors\") for the expansion coefficients. By encoding\nexpectations about the naturalness of these coefficients, this framework\nprovides a statistical interpretation of the standard EFT procedure where\ntruncation errors are estimated using the order-by-order convergence of the\nexpansion. It also permits exploration of the ways in which such error bars\nare, and are not, sensitive to assumptions about EFT-coefficient naturalness.\nWe first demonstrate the calculation of Bayesian probability distributions for\nthe EFT truncation error in some representative examples, and then focus on the\napplication of chiral EFT to neutron-proton scattering. Epelbaum, Krebs, and\nMei{\\ss}ner recently articulated explicit rules for estimating truncation\nerrors in such EFT calculations of few-nucleon-system properties. We find that\ntheir basic procedure emerges generically from one class of naturalness priors\nconsidered, and that all such priors result in consistent quantitative\npredictions for 68% DOB intervals. We then explore several methods by which the\nconvergence properties of the EFT for a set of observables may be used to check\nthe statistical consistency of the EFT expansion parameter.\n", "  Spontaneous breaking of time-reversal symmetry in superconductors with the\n$p_x+ip_y$ symmetry of the order parameter allows for a class of effects which\nare analogous to the anomalous Hall effect in ferromagnets. These effects exist\nbelow the critical temperature, $T<T_{c}$. We develop a kinetic theory of such\neffects. In particular, we consider anomalous Hall thermal conductivity, the\npolar Kerr effect, the anomalous Hall effect, and the anomalous photo- and\nacousto-galvanic effects.\n", "  We study the entanglement of a pure state of a composite quantum system\nconsisting of several subsystems with $d$ levels each. It can be described by\nthe R\\'enyi-Ingarden-Urbanik entropy $S_q$ of a decomposition of the state in a\nproduct basis, minimized over all local unitary transformations. In the case\n$q=0$ this quantity becomes a function of the rank of the tensor representing\nthe state, while in the limit $q \\to \\infty$ the entropy becomes related to the\noverlap with the closest separable state and the geometric measure of\nentanglement. For any bipartite system the entropy $S_1$ coincides with the\nstandard entanglement entropy. We analyze the distribution of the minimal\nentropy for random states of three and four-qubit systems. In the former case\nthe distributions of $3$-tangle is studied and some of its moments are\nevaluated, while in the latter case we analyze the distribution of the\nhyperdeterminant. The behavior of the maximum overlap of a three-qudit system\nwith the closest separable state is also investigated in the asymptotic limit.\n", "  In Weyl materials the valence and conduction electron bands touch at an even\nnumber of isolated points in the Brillouin zone. In the vicinity of these\npoints the electron dispersion is linear and may be described by the massless\nDirac equation. This results in nontrivial topology of Berry connection\ncurvature. One of its consequences is the existence of peculiar surface\nelectron states whose Fermi surfaces form arcs connecting projections of the\nWeyl points onto the surface plane. Band bending near the boundary of the\ncrystal also produces surface states. We show that in Weyl materials band\nbending near the crystal surface gives rise to spiral structure of energy\nsurfaces of arc states. The corresponding Fermi surface has the shape of a\nspiral that winds about the projection of the Weyl point onto the surface\nplane. The direction of the winding is determined by the helicity of the Weyl\npoint and the sign of the band bending potential. For close valleys arc state\nmorphology may be understood in terms of avoided crossing of oppositely winding\nspirals.\n", "  Background: At energies near the Coulomb barrier, capture reactions in\nheavy-ion collisions result either in fusion or in quasifission. The former\nproduces a compound nucleus in statistical equilibrium, while the second leads\nto a reseparation of the fragments after partial mass equilibration without\nformation of a compound nucleus. Extracting the compound nucleus formation\nprobability is crucial to predict superheavy-element formation cross-sections.\nIt requires a good knowledge of the fragment angular distribution which itself\ndepends on quantities such as moments of inertia and excitation energies which\nhave so far been somewhat arbitrary for the quasifission contribution.\n  Methods: We investigate the evolution of the nuclear density in\ntime-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) calculations leading to quasifission. Our\nmain goal is to extract ingredients of the formula used in the analysis of\nexperimental angular distributions. These include the moment-of-inertia and\ntemperature. We study the dependence of these quantities on various initial\nconditions of the reaction process.\n  Results: The evolution of the moment of inertia is clearly non-trivial and\ndepends strongly on the characteristics of the collision. The temperature rises\nquickly when the kinetic energy is transformed into internal excitation. Then,\nit rises slowly during mass transfer.\n  Conclusions: Fully microscopic theories are useful to predict the complex\nevolution of quantities required in macroscopic models of quasifission.\n", "  We consider ultracold quantum gases of scalar bosons, residing in a coupling\nstrength--density regime in which they constitute a twofold fragmented\ncondensate trapped in a single well. It is shown that the corresponding quantum\nstates are, in the appropriate Fock space basis, identical to the photon cat\nstates familiar in quantum optics, which correspond to superpositions of\ncoherent states of the light field with a phase difference of $\\pi$. In marked\ndistinction to photon cat states, the very existence of matter wave cat states\nhowever crucially depends on the many-body correlations of the constituent\nparticles. We consequently establish that the quadratures of the effective\n\"photons,\" expressing the highly nonclassical nature of the macroscopic matter\nwave superposition state, can be experimentally accessed by measuring the\ndensity-density correlations of the interacting quantum gas.\n", "  A central assumption in quantum key distribution (QKD) is that Eve has no\nknowledge about which rounds will be used for parameter estimation or key\ndistillation. Here we show that this assumption is violated for iterative\nsifting, a sifting procedure that has been employed in some (but not all) of\nthe recently suggested QKD protocols in order to increase their efficiency. We\nshow that iterative sifting leads to two security issues: (1) some rounds are\nmore likely to be key rounds than others, (2) the public communication of past\nmeasurement choices changes this bias round by round. We analyze these two\npreviously unnoticed problems, present eavesdropping strategies that exploit\nthem, and find that the two problems are independent. We discuss some sifting\nprotocols in the literature that are immune to these problems. While some of\nthese would be inefficient replacements for iterative sifting, we find that the\nsifting subroutine of an asymptotically secure protocol suggested by Lo et al\n(2005 J. Cryptol. 18 133-65), which we call LCA sifting, has an efficiency on\npar with that of iterative sifting. One of our main results is to show that LCA\nsifting can be adapted to achieve secure sifting in the finite-key regime. More\nprecisely, we combine LCA sifting with a certain parameter estimation protocol,\nand we prove the finite-key security of this combination. Hence we propose that\nLCA sifting should replace iterative sifting in future QKD implementations.\nMore generally, we present two formal criteria for a sifting protocol that\nguarantee its finite-key security. Our criteria may guide the design of future\nprotocols and inspire a more rigorous QKD analysis, which has neglected\nsifting-related attacks so far.\n", "  We investigate prospects of using counter-rotating vortex superposition\nstates in non-equilibrium exciton-polariton Bose-Einstein condensates for the\npurposes of Sagnac interferometry. We first investigate the stability of\nvortex-antivortex superposition states, and show that they survive at\nsteady-state in a variety of configurations. Counter-rotating vortex\nsuperpositions are of potential interest to gyroscope and seismometer\napplications for detecting rotations. Methods of improving the sensitivity are\ninvestigated by targeting high momentum states via metastable condensation, and\nthe application of periodic lattices. The sensitivity of the polariton\ngyroscope is compared to its optical and atomic counterparts. Due to the large\ninterferometer areas in optical systems and small de Broglie wavelengths for\natomic BECs, the sensitivity per detected photon is found to be considerably\nless for the polariton gyroscope than with competing methods. However,\npolariton gyroscopes have an advantage over atomic BECs in a high\nsignal-to-noise ratio, and have other practical advantages such as\nroom-temperature operation and robust design. We estimate that the final\nsensitivities including signal-to-noise aspects are competitive with existing\nmethods.\n", "  Many phenomena in solid-state physics can be understood in terms of their\ntopological properties. Recently, controlled protocols of quantum walks are\nproving to be effective simulators of such phenomena. Here we report the\nrealization of a photonic quantum walk showing both the trivial and the\nnon-trivial topologies associated with chiral symmetry in one-dimensional\nperiodic systems, as in the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model of polyacetylene. We\nfind that the probability distribution moments of the walker position after\nmany steps behave differently in the two topological phases and can be used as\ndirect indicators of the quantum transition: while varying a control parameter,\nthese moments exhibit a slope discontinuity at the transition point, and remain\nconstant in the non-trivial phase. Extending this approach to higher\ndimensions, different topological classes, and other typologies of quantum\nphases may offer new general instruments for investigating quantum transitions\nin such complex systems.\n", "  When immersed in a see of cold electrons, local impurities give rise to\ndensity modulations known as Friedel oscillations. In spite of the generality\nof this phenomenon, the exact shape of these modulations is usually computed\nonly for non-interacting electrons with a quadratic dispersion relation. In\nactual materials, one needs to take into account several additional factors,\nsuch as (i) the details of the band structure, (ii) the lifetime of\nquasiparticles, (iii) in superconductors, the presence of a pairing gap.\nStudying how these effects influence Friedel oscillations is a viable way to\naccess the properties of fermionic excitations in strongly-correlated\nmaterials. In this work we analyze the signatures of Friedel oscillations in\nSTM and X-ray scattering experiments, focusing on the concrete example of\ncuprates superconductors. A detailed comparison with recent experiments reveals\na rich interplay between local modulation of the chemical potential and of the\npairing gap.\n", "  Non-Maxwellian metaequilibria can exist in low-collisionality plasmas as\nevidenced by satellite and laboratory measurements. By including the full\npressure tensor dynamics in a fluid plasma model, we show that a sheared\nvelocity field can provide an effective mechanism that makes an initial\nisotropic state anisotropic and agyrotropic. We discuss how the propagation of\nmagneto-elastic waves can affect the pressure tensor anisotropization and its\nspatial filamentation which are due to the action of both the magnetic field\nand flow strain tensor. We support this analysis by a numerical integration of\nthe nonlinear equations describing the pressure tensor evolution.\n", "  This is an introduction to antilinear operators. In following E.P.Wigner the\nterminus \"antilinear\" is used as it is standard in Physics. Mathematicians\nprefer to say \"conjugate linear\". By restricting to finite-dimensional\ncomplex-linear spaces, the exposition becomes elementary in the functional\nanalytic sense. Nevertheless it shows the amazing differences to the linear\ncase.\n  Basics of antilinearity is explained in sections 2, 3,4, 7 and in subsection\n1.2: Spectrum, canonical Hermitian form, antilinear rank one and two operators,\nthe Hermitian adjoint, classification of antilinear normal operators, (skew)\nconjugations, involutions, and acq-lines, i.e. the antilinear counterparts of\n1-parameter operator groups. Applications include the representation of the\nLagrangian Grassmannian by conjugations, its covering by acq-lines, as well as\nresults on equivalence relations. After remembering elementary Tomita-Takesaki\ntheory, antilinear maps, assiciated associated to a two-partite quantum system,\nare defined. By allowing to write modular objects as twisted products of pairs\nof them, they open some new ways to express EPR and teleportation tasks. The\nappendix presents a look onto the rich structure of antilinear operator spaces.\n", "  We introduce a new kind of quantum measurement that is defined to be\nsymmetric in the sense of uniform Fisher information across a set of parameters\nthat injectively represent pure quantum states in the neighborhood of a\nfiducial pure state. The measurement is locally informationally\ncomplete---i.e., it uniquely determines these parameters, as opposed to\ndistinguishing two arbitrary quantum states---and it is maximal in the sense of\na multi-parameter quantum Cramer-Rao bound. For a $d$-dimensional quantum\nsystem, requiring only local informational completeness allows us to reduce the\nnumber of outcomes of the measurement from a minimum close to but below $4d-3$,\nfor the usual notion of global pure-state informational completeness, to\n$2d-1$.\n", "  We explore the effects of the general non-minimally coupled $RF^2$-type\ncouplings on the holographic s-wave superconductors numerically in the\nSchwarzschild-AdS background. We calculate the condensation and conductivity of\nthe model for the coupling parameters $a_1$ and $\\beta$. We obtain that the\nbigger deviations of the parameter $a_1$ from the minimal case lead to the\nlarger deviations of the gap frequency from the universal value $\\omega_g/T_c\n\\approx 8$. Moreover the smaller $\\beta $ and $a_1$ cause to gradually stronger\nand narrower coherence peak.\n", "  Missing energy signals such as monojets are a possible signature of Dark\nMatter (DM) at colliders. However, neutrino interactions beyond the Standard\nModel may also produce missing energy signals. In order to conclude that new\n\"missing particles\" are observed the hypothesis of BSM neutrino interactions\nmust be rejected. In this paper, we first derive new limits on these\nNon-Standard neutrino Interactions (NSIs) from LHC monojet data. For heavy NSI\nmediators, these limits are much stronger than those coming from traditional\nlow-energy $\\nu$ scattering or $\\nu$ oscillation experiments for some flavor\nstructures. Monojet data alone can be used to infer the mass of the \"missing\nparticle\" from the shape of the missing energy distribution. In particular, 13\nTeV LHC data will have sensitivity to DM masses greater than $\\sim$ 1 TeV. In\naddition to the monojet channel, NSI can be probed in multi-lepton searches\nwhich we find to yield stronger limits at heavy mediator masses. The\nsensitivity offered by these multi-lepton channels provide a method to reject\nor confirm the DM hypothesis in missing energy searches.\n", "  A particular example is produced to prove that quantum walks can be used to\nsimulate full-fledged discrete gauge theories. A new family of $2D$ walks is\nintroduced and its continuous limit is shown to coincide with the dynamics of a\nDirac fermion coupled to arbitrary electromagnetic fields. The electromagnetic\ninterpretation is extended beyond the continuous limit by proving that these\nDTQWs exhibit an exact discrete local $U(1)$ gauge invariance and possess a\ndiscrete gauge-invariant conserved current. A discrete gauge-invariant\nelectromagnetic field is also constructed and that field is coupled to the\nconserved current by a discrete generalization of Maxwell equations. The\ndynamics of the DTQWs under crossed electric and magnetic fields is finally\nexplored outside the continuous limit by numerical simulations. Bloch\noscillations and the so-called ${\\bf E} \\times {\\bf B}$ drift are recovered in\nthe weak-field limit. Localization is observed for some values of the gauge\nfields.\n", "  In this paper, we study a monitoring method for neutron flux for the\nspallation target used in an accelerator driven sub-critical (ADS) system,\nwhere a spallation target located vertically at the centre of a sub-critical\ncore is bombarded vertically by high-energy protons from an accelerator. First,\nby considering the characteristics in the spatial variation of neutron flux\nfrom the spallation target, we propose a multi-point measurement technique,\ni.e. the spallation neutron flux should be measured at multiple vertical\nlocations. To explain why the flux should be measured at multiple locations, we\nhave studied neutron production from a tungsten target bombarded by a 250\nMeV-proton beam with Geant4-based Monte Carlo simulations. The simulation\nresults indicate that the neutron flux at the central location is up to three\norders of magnitude higher than the flux at lower locations. Secondly, we have\ndeveloped an effective technique in order to measure the spallation neutron\nflux with a fission chamber (FC), by establishing the relation between the\nfission rate measured by FC and the spallation neutron flux. Since this\nrelation is linear for a FC, a constant calibration factor is used to derive\nthe neutron flux from the measured fission rate. This calibration factor can be\nextracted from the energy spectra of spallation neutrons. Finally, we have\nevaluated the proposed calibration method for a FC in the environment of an ADS\nsystem. The results indicate that the proposed method functions very well.\n", "  This paper explores hydrodynamics and hydrostatic of a star in post-Newtonian\napproximation of massive Bran-Dicke gravity. We study approximated solution of\nthe field equations upto $O(c^{-4})$ and generalize Euler equation of motion.\nWe then formulate equations governing hydrodynamics, stability and instability\nof the system. Finally, we discuss spherically symmetric stars for a specific\nbarptropic case like dust, cosmic string and domain wall in this scenario.\n", "  Many state-of-the-art QCD calculations for multileg processes use helicity\namplitudes as their fundamental ingredients. We construct a simple and\neasy-to-use helicity operator basis in soft-collinear effective theory (SCET),\nfor which the hard Wilson coefficients from matching QCD onto SCET are directly\ngiven in terms of color-ordered helicity amplitudes. Using this basis allows\none to seamlessly combine fixed-order helicity amplitudes at any order they are\nknown with a resummation of higher-order logarithmic corrections. In\nparticular, the virtual loop amplitudes can be employed in factorization\ntheorems to make predictions for exclusive jet cross sections without the use\nof numerical subtraction schemes to handle real-virtual infrared cancellations.\nWe also discuss matching onto SCET in renormalization schemes with helicities\nin $4$- and $d$-dimensions. To demonstrate that our helicity operator basis is\neasy to use, we provide an explicit construction of the operator basis, as well\nas results for the hard matching coefficients, for $pp\\to H + 0,1,2$ jets,\n$pp\\to W/Z/\\gamma + 0,1,2$ jets, and $pp\\to 2,3$ jets. These operator bases are\ncompletely crossing symmetric, so the results can easily be applied to\nprocesses with $e^+e^-$ and $e^-p$ collisions.\n", "  The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) will be the largest time-domain\nphotometric survey ever. In order to maximize the LSST science yield for a\nbroad array of transient stellar phenomena, it is necessary to optimize the\nsurvey cadence, coverage, and depth via quantitative metrics that are\nspecifically designed to characterize the time-domain behavior of various types\nof stellar transients. In this paper we present three such metrics built on the\nLSST Metric Analysis Framework (MAF) model (Jones et al. 2014). Two of the\nmetrics quantify the ability of LSST to detect non-periodic and/or\nnon-recurring transient events, and the ability of LSST to reliably measure\nperiodic signals of various timescales. The third metric provides a way to\nquantify the range of stellar parameters in the stellar populations that LSST\nwill probe. We provide example uses of these metrics and discuss some\nimplications based on these metrics for optimization of the LSST survey for\nobservations of stellar variables and transients.\n", "  We report the development of a user-friendly nano-visualization software\nprogram which can acquaint high-school students with nanotechnology. The visual\nintroduction to atoms and molecules, which are the building blocks of this\ntechnology, is an effective way to introduce the key concepts in this area. The\nsoftware's graphical user interface enables multidimensional atomic\nvisualization by using ball and stick schematics. Additionally, the software\nprovides the option of wavefunction visualization for arbitrary nanomaterials\nand nanostructures by using extended Huckel theory. The software is\ninstructive, application oriented and may be useful not only in high school\neducation but also for the undergraduate research and teaching.\n", "  According to mathematical constructivism, a mathematical object can exist\nonly if there is a way to compute (or \"construct\") it; so, what is\nnon-computable is non-constructive. In the example of the quantum model, whose\nFock states are associated with Fibonacci numbers, this paper shows that the\nmathematical formalism of quantum mechanics is non-constructive since it\npermits an undecidable (or effectively impossible) subset of Hilbert space. On\nthe other hand, as it is argued in the paper, if one believes that testability\nof predictions is the most fundamental property of any physical theory, one\nneed to accept that quantum mechanics must be an effectively calculable (and\nthus mathematically constructive) theory. With that, a way to reformulate\nquantum mechanics constructively, while keeping its mathematical foundation\nunchanged, leads to hypercomputation. In contrast, the proposed in the paper\nsuperselection rule, which acts by effectively forbidding a coherent\nsuperposition of quantum states corresponding to potential and actual infinity,\ncan introduce computable constructivism in a quantum mechanical theory with no\nneed for hypercomputation.\n", "  An infinite projected entangled-pair state (iPEPS) is a variational tensor\nnetwork ansatz for 2D wave functions in the thermodynamic limit where the\naccuracy can be systematically controlled by the bond dimension $D$. We show\nthat for the doped Hubbard model in the strongly correlated regime ($U/t=8$,\n$n=0.875$) iPEPS yields lower variational energies than state-of-the-art\nvariational methods in the large 2D limit, which demonstrates the\ncompetitiveness of the method. In order to obtain an accurate estimate of the\nenergy in the exact infinite $D$ limit we introduce and test an extrapolation\ntechnique based on a truncation error computed in the iPEPS imaginary time\nevolution algorithm. The extrapolated energies are compared with accurate\nquantum Monte Carlo results at half filling and with various other methods in\nthe doped, strongly correlated regime.\n", "  Quantum gravity has exciting peculiarities on the Planck scale.The effect of\ngeneralized uncertainty principle (GUP) to the entangled scalar/fermion\nparticles' tunneling from a Schwarzschild black hole immersed in an\nelectromagnetic Universe is investigated by the help of semi-classical\ntunneling method. The quantum corrected Hawking temperature of this black hole\nwith an external parameter \"a\" modifies the Hawking temperature for the\nentangled particles.\n", "  We analyze the sensitivity of next-generation tonne-scale neutrinoless double\n$\\beta$-decay ($0\\nu\\beta\\beta$) experiments and searches for same-sign\ndi-electrons plus jets at the Large Hadron Collider to TeV scale lepton number\nviolating interactions. Taking into account previously unaccounted for physics\nand detector backgrounds at the LHC, renormalization group evolution, and\nlong-range contributions to $0\\nu\\beta\\beta$ nuclear matrix elements, we find\nthat the reach of tonne-scale $0\\nu\\beta\\beta$ generally exceeds that of the\nLHC. However, for a range of heavy particle masses near the TeV scale, the high\nluminosity LHC and tonne-scale $0\\nu\\beta\\beta$ may provide complementary\nprobes.\n", "  For light and medium mass systems the capture cross-section may be considered\nto be the same as that for complete fusion, whereas for heavy systems leading\nto superheavy formations the evaporation residue cross-section is dramatically\nreduced due to the quasifission (QF) and fusion-fission processes thus making\nthe capture cross-section to be essentially the sum of these two\ncross-sections, with QF occurring at a much shorter time-scale. Consequently,\nquasifission is the primary reaction mechanism that limits the formation of\nsuperheavy nuclei. Within the last few years the time-dependent Hartree-Fock\n(TDHF) approach has been utilized for studying the dynamics of quasifission.\nThe study of quasifission is showing a great promise to provide insight based\non very favorable comparisons with experimental data. In this article we will\nfocus on the TDHF calculations of quasifission observables for the\n$^{48}$Ca+$^{249}$Bk system.\n", "  Bound, antibound and resonance states are associated to poles in the on-shell\npartial wave amplitudes. We show here that from the residues of the pole a rank\n1 projection operator associated with any of these states can be extracted, in\nterms of which a sum rule related to the composition of the state can be\nderived. Although typically it involves complex coefficients for the\ncompositeness and elementariness, except for the bound state case, we\ndemonstrate that one can formulate a meaningful compositeness relation with\nonly positive coefficients for resonances whose associated Laurent series in\nthe variable s converges in a region of the physical axis around Re(s_P), with\ns_P the pole position of the resonance. It is also shown that this result can\nbe considered as an analytical extrapolation in s_P of the clear narrow\nresonance case. We exemplify this formalism to study the two-body components of\nseveral resonances of interest.\n", "  MnAu$_{2}$ is a spin-spiral material with in-plane ferromagnetic Mn layers\nthat form a screw-type pattern around a tetragonal $c$ axis. The spiral angle\n$\\theta$ was shown using neutron diffraction experiments to decrease with\npressure, and in later studies it was found to suffer a collapse to a\nferromagnetic state above a critical pressure, although the two separate\nexperiments did not agree on whether this phase transition is first or second\norder. To resolve this contradiction, we use density functional theory\ncalculations to investigate the spiral state as a function of pressure, charge\ndoping, and also electronic correlations via a Hubbard-like $U$. We fit the\nresults to the one-dimensional $J_{1} - J_{2} - J_{3} - J_{4}$ Heisenberg\nmodel, which predicts either a first- or second-order spiral-to-ferromagnetic\nphase transition for different regions of parameter space. At ambient pressure,\nMnAu$_{2}$ sits close in parameter space to a dividing line separating first-\nand second-order transitions, and a combination of pressure and electron doping\nshifts the system from the first-order region into the second-order region. Our\nfindings demonstrate that the contradiction in pressure experiments regarding\nthe kind of phase transition are likely due to variations in sample quality.\nOur results also suggest that MnAu$_{2}$ is amenable to engineering via\nchemical doping and to controlling $\\theta$ using pressure and gate voltages,\nwhich holds potential for integration in spintronic devices.\n", "  We report on a fan-shaped set of high-speed jets above a strongly magnetized\nlight bridge (LB) of a sunspot observed in the H$\\alpha$ line. We study the\norigin, dynamics and thermal properties of the jets using high-resolution\nimaging spectroscopy in H$\\alpha$ from the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope and data\nfrom the Solar Dynamics Observatory and Hinode. The H$\\alpha$ jets have lengths\nof 7-38 Mm, are impulsively accelerated to a speed of $\\sim 100$ km/s close to\nphotospheric footpoints in the LB, and exhibit a constant deceleration\nconsistent with solar effective gravity. They are predominantly launched from\none edge of the light bridge, and their footpoints appear bright in the\nH$\\alpha$ wings. AIA data indicates elongated brightenings that are nearly\nco-spatial with the H$\\alpha$ jets. We interpret them as jets of at least\ntransition region temperatures. The magnetic field in the light bridge has a\nstrength of $0.8-2$ kG and it is nearly horizontal. All jet properties are\nconsistent with magnetic reconnection as the driver.\n", "  We consider the quantum transport in a tight-binding chain with a locally\napplied potential which is oscillating in time. The steady state for such a\ndriven impurity can be calculated exactly for any energy and applied potential\nusing the Floquet formalism. The resulting transmission has a non-trivial,\nnon-monotonic behavior depending on incoming momentum, driving frequency, and\nthe strength of the applied periodic potential. Hence there is an abundance of\ntuning possibilities, which allows to find resonances of total reflection for\nany choice of incoming momentum and periodic potential. Remarkably, this\nimplies that even for an arbitrarily small infinitesimal impurity potential it\nis always possible to find a resonance frequency at which there is a\ncatastrophic breakdown of the transmission T=0. The points of zero transmission\nare closely related to the phenomenon of Fano resonances at dynamically created\nbound states in the continuum. The results are relevant for a variety of\none-dimensional systems where local AC driving is possible, such as quantum\nnanodot arrays, ultracold gases in optical lattices, photonic crystals, or\nmolecular electronics.\n", "  Our current understanding of strongly correlated electron systems is based on\na homogeneous framework. Here we take a step going beyond this paradigm by\nincorporating inhomogeneity from the beginning. Specifying to systems near the\nMott metal-insulator transition, we propose a real space picture of itinerant\nelectrons functioning in the fluctuating geometries bounded by interfaces\nbetween metallic and insulating regions. In 2+1-dimensions, the interfaces are\nclosed bosonic strings, and we have a system of strings coupled to itinerant\nelectrons. When the interface tension vanishes, the geometric fluctuations\nbecome critical, which gives rise to non-Fermi liquid behavior for the\nitinerant electrons. In particular, the poles of the fermion Green's function\ncan be converted to zeros, indicating the absence of propagating\nquasiparticles. Furthermore, the quantum geometric fluctuations mediate Cooper\npairing among the itinerant electrons, indicating the intrinsic instability of\nelectronic systems near the Mott transition.\n", "  Active stabilization in systems with zero or negative stiffness is an\nessential element of a wide variety of biological processes. We study a\nprototypical example of this phenomenon at a micro-scale and show how active\nrigidity, interpreted as a formation of a pseudo-well in the effective energy\nlandscape, can be generated in an overdamped ratchet-type stochastic system. We\nlink the transition from negative to positive rigidity with correlations in the\nnoise and show that subtle differences in out-of-equilibrium driving may\ncompromise the emergence of a pseudo-well.\n", "  We consider the phase diagram of twisted mass Wilson fermions of two-flavor\nQCD in the parameter space of the quark mass, the isospin chemical potential,\nthe twist angle and the lattice spacing. This work extends earlier studies in\nthe continuum and those at zero chemical potential. We evaluate the phase\ndiagram as well as the spectrum of the (pseudo-)Goldstone bosons using the\nchiral Lagrangian for twisted mass Wilson fermions at non-zero isospin chemical\npotential. The phases are obtained from a mean field analysis. At zero twist\nangle we find that already an infinitesimal isospin chemical potential destroys\nthe Aoki phase. The reason is that in this phase we have massless Goldstone\nbosons with a non-zero isospin charge. At finite twist angle only two different\nphases are present, one phase which is continuously connected to the Bose\ncondensed phase at non-zero chemical potential and another phase which is\ncontinuously connected to the normal phase. For either zero or maximal twist\nthe phase diagram is more complicated as the saddle point equations allow for\nmore solutions.\n", "  This article reports the experimentally clarified crystal structure of a\nrecently discovered sulfur hydride in high temperature superconducting phase\nwhich has the highest critical temperature Tc over 200 K which has been ever\nreported. For understanding the mechanism of the high superconductivity, the\ninformation of its crystal structure is very essential. Herein we have carried\nout the simultaneous measurements electrical resistance and synchrotron x-ray\ndiffraction under high pressure, and clearly revealed that the hydrogen\nsulfide, H2S, decomposes to H3S and its crystal structure has body-centered\ncubic symmetry in the superconducting phase.\n", "  This paper considers quantum communication involving an ensemble of states.\nApart from the von Neumann entropy, it considers other measures one of which\nmay be useful in obtaining information about an unknown pure state and another\nthat may be useful in quantum games. It is shown that under certain conditions\nin a two-party quantum game, the receiver of the states can increase the\nentropy by adding another pure state.\n", "  Canonical quantization of quantum field theory models is inherently related\nto the Lorentz invariant partition of classical fields into the positive and\nthe negative frequency parts $u(x) = u^+(x) + u^-(x),$ performed with the help\nof Fourier transform in Minkowski space. That is the commutation relations are\nbeing established between non localized solutions of field equations. At the\nsame time the construction of divergence free physical theory requires the\nseparation of the contributions of different space-time scales. In present\npaper, using the light-cone variables, we propose a quantization procedure\nwhich is compatible with separation of scales using continuous wavelet\ntransform, as described in our previous paper Phys.Rev D 88(2013)025015\n", "  In recent years, Bayesian methods have been proposed as a solution to a wide\nrange of issues in quantum state and process tomography. State-of-the-art\nBayesian tomography solutions suffer from three problems: numerical\nintractability, a lack of informative prior distributions, and an inability to\ntrack time-dependent processes. Here, we address all three problems. First, we\nuse modern statistical methods, as pioneered by Husz\\'ar and Houlsby and by\nFerrie, to make Bayesian tomography numerically tractable. Our approach allows\nfor practical computation of Bayesian point and region estimators for quantum\nstates and channels. Second, we propose the first priors on quantum states and\nchannels that allow for including useful experimental insight. Finally, we\ndevelop a method that allows tracking of time-dependent states and estimates\nthe drift and diffusion processes affecting a state. We provide source code and\nanimated visual examples for our methods.\n", "  It is spatial dispersion which is exclusively responsible for the emergence\nof exchange interaction and magnetic ordering. In contrast, magneto-crystalline\nanisotropy present in any realistic material brings in a certain non-linearity\nto the equation of motion. Unlike homogeneous ferromagnetic ordering a variety\nof non-collinear ground state configurations emerge as a result of competition\namong exchange, anisotropy, and dipole-dipole interaction. These particle-like\nstates, e.g. magnetic soliton, skyrmion, domain wall, form a spatially\nlocalised clot of magnetic energy. In this paper we explore topologically\nprotected magnetic solitons that might potentially be applied for logical\noperations and/or information storage in the rapidly advancing filed of\nsolitonics (and skyrmionics). An ability to easily create, address, and\nmanipulate such structures is among the prerequisite forming a basis of -onics\ntechnology, and is investigated in detail here using numerical and analytical\ntools.\n", "  Charge carrier localization in extended atomic systems has been described\npreviously as being driven by disorder, point defects or distortions of the\nionic lattice. Here we show for the first time by means of first-principles\ncomputations that charge carriers can spontaneously localize due to a purely\nelectronic effect in otherwise perfectly ordered structures. Optimally-tuned\nrange-separated density functional theory and many-body perturbation\ncalculations within the GW approximation reveal that in trans-polyacetylene and\npolythiophene the hole density localizes on a length scale of several\nnanometers. This is due to exchange-induced translational symmetry breaking of\nthe charge density. Ionization potentials, optical absorption peaks, excitonic\nbinding energies and the optimally-tuned range parameter itself all become\nindependent of polymer length as it exceeds the critical localization scale.\nMoreover, lattice disorder and the formation of a polaron result from the\ncharge localization in contrast to the traditional view that lattice\ndistortions precede charge localization. Our results can explain experimental\nfindings that polarons in conjugated polymers form instantaneously after\nexposure to ultrafast light pulses.\n", "  We report quantum enhancement of Faraday rotation spin noise spectroscopy by\npolarization squeezing of the probe beam. Using natural abundance Rb in 100\nTorr of N_2 buffer gas, and squeezed light from a sub-threshold optical\nparametric oscillator stabilized 20 GHz to the blue of the D_1 resonance, we\nobserve that an input squeezing of 3.0 dB improves the signal-to-noise ratio by\n1.5 dB to 2.6 dB over the combined (power)$\\otimes$(number density) ranges (0.5\nmW to 4.0 mW )$\\otimes$(1.5 x 10^{12} cm^{-3} to 1.3 x 10^{13} cm^{-3}),\ncovering the ranges used in optimized spin noise spectroscopy experiments. We\nalso show that squeezing improves the trade-off between statistical sensitivity\nand broadening effects, a previously unobserved quantum advantage.\n", "  We consider the inflation produced by two coupled fluids in the flat\nFriedmann-Robertson-Walker universe. Different cosmological models for\ndescribing inflation by use of an inhomogeneous equation of state for the fluid\nare investigated. The gravitational equations for energy and matter are solved,\nand analytic representations for the Hubble parameter and the energy density\nare obtained. Corrections in the energy density for matter inducing the\ninflation and the coupling with energy are discussed. We analyze the\ndescription of inflation induced by non-constant equation-of-state parameters\nfrom fluid viscosity. The correspondence between the spectral index and the\ntensor-to-scalar ratio recently observed by the Planck satellite is considered.\n", "  We developed a quantum field theoretical description for the surface states\nof three-dimensional topological insulators. Within the relativistic quantum\nfield theory formulation, we investigated the dynamics of low-lying surface\nstates in an applied transverse magnetic field. We argued that, by taking into\naccount quantum fluctuations, in three-dimensional topological insulators there\nis dynamical generation of a gap by a rearrangement of the Dirac sea. By\ncomparing with available experimental data we found that our theoretical\nresults allowed a consistent and coherent description of the Landau level\nspectrum of the surface low-lying excitations. Finally, we showed that the\nrecently detected zero-Hall plateau at the charge neutral point could be\naccounted for by chiral edge states residing at the magnetic domain boundaries\nbetween the top and bottom surfaces of the three-dimensional topological\ninsulator.\n", "  We study the heavy quarkonium within the basis light-front quantization\napproach. We implement the one-gluon exchange interaction and a confining\npotential inspired by light-front holography. We adopt the holographic\nlight-front wavefunction (LFWF) as our basis function and solve the\nnon-perturbative dynamics by diagonalizing the Hamiltonian matrix. We obtain\nthe mass spectrum for charmonium and bottomonium. With the obtained LFWFs, we\nalso compute the decay constants and the charge form factors for selected\neigenstates. The results are compared with the experimental measurements and\nwith other established methods.\n", "  We conjecture that the quantum complexity of a holographic state is dual to\nthe action of a certain spacetime region that we call a Wheeler-DeWitt patch.\nWe illustrate and test the conjecture in the context of neutral, charged, and\nrotating black holes in AdS, as well as black holes perturbed with static\nshells and with shock waves. This conjecture evolved from a previous conjecture\nthat complexity is dual to spatial volume, but appears to be a major\nimprovement over the original. In light of our results, we discuss the\nhypothesis that black holes are the fastest computers in nature.\n", "  It is demonstrated that novel spin frustration can be induced in ferromagnets\nwith nonuniform Land\\'{e} $g$-factors. The frustrated state is characterized by\na mutual interplay of typical ferromagnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic (AF)\nfeatures, such as the zero-field susceptibility being FM-like at low\ntemperatures but AF-like at high temperatures. It is also found to contain an\nexotic zero-temperature `half fire, half ice' critical point at which the spins\non one sublattice are fully disordered and on the other one are fully ordered.\nWe suggest that such frustration may occur in a number of copper-iridium oxides\nsuch as Sr$_3$CuIrO$_6$. We also anticipate a realization of the frustration\nand `partial fire, partial ice' states in certain antiferromagnets, lattice\ngas, and neuron systems.\n", "  The electric permittivities and magnetic permeabilities for a relativistic\nelectron gas are calculated from quantum electrodynamics at finite temperature\nand density as functions of temperature, chemical potential, frequency, and\nwavevector. The polarization and the magnetization depend linearly on both\nelectric and magnetic fields, and are the sum of a zero-temperature and\nzero-density vacuum part with a temperature- and chemical potential-dependent\nmedium part. Analytic calculations lead to generalized expressions that depend\non three scalar functions. In the nonrelativistic limit, results reproduce the\nLindhard formula. In the relativistic case, and in the long wavelength limit,\nwe obtain: i) for $\\omega=0$, generalized susceptibilities that reduce to known\nnonrelativistic limits; ii) for $\\omega \\neq 0$, Drude-type responses at zero\nand at high temperatures. The latter implies that one may have both $\\epsilon$\nand $\\mu$ simultaneously negative, a behavior characteristic of metamaterials.\nThis unambiguously indicates that the relativistic electron plasma is one of\nnature's candidates for the realization of a negative index of refraction\nsystem. Moreover, Maxwell's equations in the medium yield the dispersion\nrelation and the index of refraction of the electron plasma. Present results\nshould be relevant for plasma physics, astrophysical observations,\nsynchrotrons, and other environments with fast moving electrons.\n", "  We study the near horizon geometry of black ring solutions in\nfive-dimensional U(1)^3 supergravity with three electric dipole charges and one\nangular momentum. We consider the extremal vanishing horizon (EVH) limit of\nthese solutions and show that the near horizon geometries develop locally AdS_3\nthroats which at the near-EVH near horizon limit the AdS_3 factor turns to a\nBTZ black hole. By analysing the first law of thermodynamics for black rings we\nshow that at EVH limit it reduces to the first law of thermodynamics for BTZ\nblack holes. Using the AdS3/CFT2 duality, we propose a dual CFT to describe the\nnear-horizon low energy dynamics of near-EVH black rings. We also discuss the\nconnection between our CFT proposal and the Kerr/CFT correspondence in the\ncases where these two overlap.\n", "  It is known that the center-of-mass energy of the collision of two massive\nparticles following geodesics around a black hole presents a maximum. The\nmaximum energy increases when the black hole is endowed with spin, and for a\nmaximally rotating hole this energy blows up, offering, in principle, a unique\nprobe of fundamental physics. This work extends the latter studies by\nconsidering that the colliding particles possess intrinsic angular momentum\n(spin), described by the Hanson-Regge-Hojman theory of spinning particles. By\nanalyzing planar trajectories of spinning particles around non-rotating black\nholes, a significant increase of the invariant collision energy is found.\nRadial turning points, causality constraints, and limitations of the theory are\ndiscussed.\n", "  Covariance of the resulting probabilities requires the \"anti-Ito\" sense. The\ncorresponding Fokker-Planck equation is simplified and preserves important\nfeatures of the case with a constant diffusion. Multiplicative noise can always\nbe removed by a change of the variables, which is specified explicitly.\n", "  The Schr\\\"odinger-Newton equation has been proposed as an experimentally\ntestable alternative to quantum gravity, accessible at low energies. It\ncontains self-gravitational terms, which slightly modify the quantum dynamics.\nHere we show that it distorts the spectrum of a harmonic system. Based on this\neffect, we propose an optomechanical experiment with a trapped microdisc to\ntest the Schr\\\"odinger-Newton equation, and we show that it can be realized\nwith existing technology.\n", "  A joint analysis of the linear matter power spectrum, distance measurements\nfrom type Ia supernovae and the position of the first peak in the anisotropy\nspectrum of the cosmic microwave background indicates a cosmological, late-time\ndark matter creation at 95% confidence level.\n", "  We use an optical centrifuge to align asymmetric top $\\mathrm{SO_2}$\nmolecules by adiabatically spinning their most polarizable O-O axis. The\neffective centrifugal potential in the rotating frame confines sulfur atoms to\nthe plane of the laser-induced rotation, leading to the planar molecular\nalignment which persists after the molecules are released from the centrifuge.\nPeriodic appearance of the full three-dimensional alignment, typically observed\nonly with linear and symmetric top molecules, is also detected. Together with\nstrong in-plane centrifugal forces, which bend the molecules by up to 10\ndegrees, permanent field-free alignment offers new ways of controlling\nmolecules with laser light.\n", "  We study the benefits of polarimetry observations of microlensing events to\ndetect and characterize circumstellar disks around the microlensed stars\nlocated at the Galactic bulge. These disks which are unresolvable from their\nhost stars make a net polarization effect due to their projected elliptical\nshapes. Gravitational microlensing can magnify these signals and make them be\nresolved. The main aim of this work is to determine what extra information\nabout these disks can be extracted from polarimetry observations of\nmicrolensing events in addition to those given by photometry ones. Hot disks\nwhich are closer to their host stars are more likely to be detected by\nmicrolensing, owing to more contributions in the total flux. By considering\nthis kind of disks, we show that although the polarimetric efficiency for\ndetecting disks is similar to the photometric observation, but polarimetry\nobservations can help to constraint the disk geometrical parameters e.g. the\ndisk inner radius and the lens trajectory with respect to the disk semimajor\naxis. On the other hand, the time scale of polarimetric curves of these\nmicrolensing events generally increases while their photometric time scale does\nnot change. By performing a Monte Carlo simulation, we show that almost 4\noptically-thin disks around the Galactic bulge sources are detected (or even\ncharacterized) through photometry (or polarimetry) observations of\nhigh-magnification microlensing events during 10 years monitoring of 150\nmillion objects.\n", "  Local galaxies with specific star-formation rates (star-formation rate per\nunit mass; sSFR~0.2-10/Gyr) as high as distant galaxies (z~1-3), are very rich\nin HI. Those with low stellar masses, log M_star (M_sun)=8-9, for example, have\nM_HI/M_star~5-30. Using continuity arguments of Peng et al. (2014), whereby the\nspecific merger rate is hypothesized to be proportional to the specific\nstar-formation rate, and HI gas mass measurements for local galaxies with high\nsSFR, we estimate that moderate mass galaxies, log M_star (M_sun)=9-10.5, can\nacquire sufficient gas through minor mergers (stellar mass ratios ~4-100) to\nsustain their star formation rates at z~2. The relative fraction of the gas\naccreted through minor mergers declines with increasing stellar mass and for\nthe most massive galaxies considered, log M_star (M_sun)=10.5-11, this\naccretion rate is insufficient to sustain their star formation. We checked our\nminor merger hypothesis at z=0 using the same methodology but now with\nrelations for local normal galaxies and find that minor mergers cannot account\nfor their specific growth rates, in agreement with observations of HI-rich\nsatellites around nearby spirals. We discuss a number of attractive features,\nlike a natural down-sizing effect, in using minor mergers with extended HI\ndisks to support star formation at high redshift. The answer to the question\nposed by the title, \"Can galaxy growth be sustained through \\HI-rich minor\nmergers?\", is maybe, but only for relatively low mass galaxies and at high\nredshift.\n", "  Motivated by recent trapped-ion quantum simulation experiments, we carry out\na comprehensive study of the phase diagram of a spin-1 chain with XXZ-type\ninteractions that decay as $1/r^{\\alpha}$, using a combination of finite and\ninfinite-size DMRG calculations, spin-wave analysis, and field theory. In the\nabsence of long-range interactions, varying the spin-coupling anisotropy leads\nto four distinct phases: a ferromagnetic Ising phase, a disordered XY phase, a\ntopological Haldane phase, and an antiferromagnetic Ising phase. If long-range\ninteractions are antiferromagnetic and thus frustrated, we find primarily a\nquantitative change of the phase boundaries. On the other hand, ferromagnetic\n(non-frustrated) long-range interactions qualitatively impact the entire phase\ndiagram. Importantly, for $\\alpha\\lesssim3$, long-range interactions destroy\nthe Haldane phase, break the conformal symmetry of the XY phase, give rise to a\nnew phase that spontaneously breaks a $U(1)$ continuous symmetry, and introduce\nan exotic tricritical point with no direct parallel in short-range interacting\nspin chains. We show that the main signatures of all five phases found could be\nobserved experimentally in the near future.\n", "  We consider the problem of quantum-state tomography under the assumption that\nthe state is pure, and more generally that its rank is bounded by a given\nvalue. In this scenario, new notions of informationally complete POVMs emerge,\nwhich allow for high-fidelity state estimation with fewer measurement outcomes\nthan are required for an arbitrary rank state. We study this in the context of\nmatrix completion, where the POVM outcomes determine only a few of the density\nmatrix elements. We give an analytic solution that fully characterizes\ninformational completeness and elucidates the important role that the\npositive-semidefinite property of density matrices plays in tomography. We show\nhow positivity can impose a stricter notion of information completeness and\nallow us to use convex optimization programs to robustly estimate bounded-rank\ndensity matrices in the presence of statistical noise.\n", "  We propose a method to measure the hyperfine vectors between a\nnitrogen-vacancy (NV) center and an environment of interacting nuclear spins.\nOur protocol enables the generation of tunable electron-nuclear coupling\nHamiltonians while suppressing unwanted inter-nuclear interactions. In this\nmanner, each nucleus can be addressed and controlled individually thereby\npermitting the reconstruction of the individual hyperfine vectors. With this\nability the 3D-structure of spin ensembles and spins in bio-molecules can be\nidentified without the necessity of varying the direction of applied magnetic\nfields. We demonstrate examples including the complete reconstruction of an\ninteracting spin cluster in diamond and 3D imaging of all the nuclear spins in\na bio-molecule.\n", "  We investigate the parameter space of the Inert Doublet Model, which is a\nstraightforward extension of the SM in the scalar sector. We apply a set of\nconstraints both from the theoretical and experimental side to extract and\ndetermine allowed regions of parameter space. These constraints put strong\nlimits on both masses and couplings of the new particles. We also present a set\nof benchmarks for the current LHC run. This work is based on [1, 2].\n", "  Conclusive evidence of order by disorder is scarce in real materials. Perhaps\none of the strongest cases presented has been for the pyrochlore XY\nantiferromagnet Er2Ti2O7, with the ground state selection proceeding by order\nby disorder induced through the effects of quantum fluctuations. This\nidentification assumes the smallness of the effect of virtual crystal field\nfluctuations that could provide an alternative route to picking the ground\nstate. Here we show that this order by virtual crystal field fluctuations is\nnot only significant, but competitive with the effects of quantum fluctuations.\nFurther, we argue that higher-multipolar interactions that are generically\npresent in rare-earth magnets can dramatically enhance this effect. From a\nsimplified bilinear-biquadratic model of these multipolar interactions, we show\nhow the virtual crystal field fluctuations manifest in Er2Ti2O7 using a\ncombination of strong coupling perturbation theory and the random phase\napproximation. We find that the experimentally observed psi2 state is indeed\nselected and the experimentally measured excitation gap can be reproduced when\nthe bilinear and biquadratic couplings are comparable while maintaining\nagreement with the entire experimental spin-wave excitation spectrum. Finally,\nwe comments on possible tests of this scenario and discuss implications for\nother order-by-disorder candidates in rare-earth magnets.\n", "  Although quantum computers are capable of solving problems like factoring\nexponentially faster than the best-known classical algorithms, determining the\nresources responsible for their computational power remains unclear. An\nimportant class of problems where quantum computers possess an advantage is\nphase estimation, which includes applications like factoring. We introduce a\nnew computational model based on a single squeezed state resource that can\nperform phase estimation, which we call the power of one qumode. This model is\ninspired by an interesting computational model known as deterministic quantum\ncomputing with one quantum bit (DQC1). Using the power of one qumode, we\nidentify that the amount of squeezing is sufficient to quantify the resource\nrequirements of different computational problems based on phase estimation. In\nparticular, it establishes a quantitative relationship between the resources\nrequired for factoring and DQC1. For example, we find the squeezing required to\nfactor has an exponential scaling whereas no squeezing (i.e., a coherent state)\nis already sufficient to solve the hardest problem in DQC1.\n", "  In this paper, we extend the GKZ-system method to the more general case:\ncompact Complete Intersection Calabi-Yau manifolds (CICY). For several\none-deformation modulus compact CICYs with D-branes, the on-shell\nsuperpotentials in this paper from the extended GKZ-system method are exactly\nconsistent with published results obtained from other methods. We further\ncompute the off-shell superpotentials of these models. Then we obtain both the\non-shell and off-shell superpotentials for sev- eral two-deformation moduli\ncompact CICYs with D-branes by using the extended GKZ-system method. The\ndiscrete symmetrical groups, Z2, Z3 and Z4, of the holo- morphic curves wrapped\nby D-branes play the important roles in computing the superpotentials, in some\nsense, they are the quantum symmetries of these models. Furthermore, through\nthe mirror symmetry, the Ooguri-Vafa invariants are extracted from the A-model\ninstanton expansion.\n", "  We propose a model for short duration gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs) based on the\nformation of a quark star after the merger of two neutron stars. We assume that\nthe sGRB central engine is a proto-magnetar, which has been previously invoked\nto explain the plateau-like X-ray emission observed following both long and\nshort GRBs. Here, we show that: i) a few milliseconds after the merger it is\npossible to form a stable and massive star made in part of quarks; ii) during\nthe early cooling phase of the incompletely formed quark star, the flux of\nbaryons ablated from the surface by neutrinos is large and it does not allow\nthe outflow to achieve a bulk Lorentz factor high enough to produce a GRB; iii)\nafter the quark burning front reaches the stellar surface, baryon ablation\nceases and the jet becomes too baryon poor to produce a GRB; iv) however,\nbetween these two phases a GRB can be produced over the finite timescale\nrequired for the baryon pollution to cease; a characteristic timescale of the\norder of $\\sim 0.1 $ s naturally results from the time the conversion front\nneeds to cover the distance between the rotational pole and the latitude of the\nlast closed magnetic field line; v) we predict a correlation between the\nluminosity of the sGRB and its duration, consistent with the data; vi) our\nmodel also predicts a delay of the order of ten seconds between the time of the\nmerger event and the sGRB, allowing for the possibility of precursor emission\nand implying that the jet will encounter the dense cocoon formed immediately\nafter the merger.\n", "  In monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), electrons in opposite\n$K$ valleys are subject to opposite effective Zeeman fields, which are referred\nto as Ising spin-orbit coupling (SOC) fields. The Ising SOC, originated from\nin-plane mirror symmetry breaking pins the electron spins in out-of-plane\ndirections, and results in the newly discovered Ising superconducting states\nwith strongly enhanced upper critical fields. In this work, we show that the\nIsing SOC generates equal-spin triplet Cooper pairs with spin polarization in\nthe in-plane directions. Importantly, the spin-triplet Cooper pairs can induce\nsuperconducting pairings in a half-metal wire placed on top of the TMD and\nresult in a topological superconductor with Majorana end states. Direct ways to\ndetect equal-spin triplet Cooper pairs and the differences between Ising\nsuperconductors and Rashba superconductors are discussed.\n", "  In a recent article [Phys. Rev. B 90, 125102 (2014)] we showed that the\nrandom phase approximation with exchange (RPAx) gives accurate total energies\nfor a diverse set of systems including the high and low density regime of the\nhomogeneous electron gas, the N$_2$ molecule, and the H$_2$ molecule at\ndissociation. In this work, we present results for the van der Waals bonded\nAr$_2$ and Kr$_2$ dimers and demonstrate that the RPAx gives superior\ndispersion forces as compared to the RPA. We then show that this improved\ndescription is crucial for the bond formation of the Mg$_2$ molecule. In\naddition, the RPAx performs better for the Be$_2$ dissociation curve at large\nnuclear separation but, similar to the RPA, fails around equilibrium due to the\nbuild up of a large repulsion hump. For the strongly correlated LiH molecule at\ndissociation we have also calculated the RPAx potential and find that the\ncorrelation peak at the bond mid-point is overestimated as compared to the RPA\nand the exact result. The step feature is missing and hence the delocalisation\nerror is comparable to the RPA. This is further illustrated by a smooth energy\nversus fractional charge curve and a poor description of the LiH dipole moment\nat dissociation.\n", "  We present a QCD calculation of the $u$, $d$ and $s$ scalar quark contents of\nnucleons based on $47$ lattice ensembles with $N_f = 2+1$ dynamical sea quarks,\n$5$ lattice spacings down to $0.054\\,\\text{fm}$, lattice sizes up to\n$6\\,\\text{fm}$ and pion masses down to $120\\,\\text{MeV}$. Using the\nFeynman-Hellmann theorem, we obtain $f^N_{ud} = 0.0405(40)(35)$ and $f^N_s =\n0.113(45)(40)$, which translates into $\\sigma_{\\pi N}=38(3)(3)\\,\\text{MeV}$,\n$\\sigma_{sN}=105(41)(37)\\,\\text{MeV}$ and $y_N=0.20(8)(8)$ for the sigma terms\nand the related ratio, where the first errors are statistical and the second\nare systematic. Using isospin relations, we also compute the individual up and\ndown quark contents of the proton and neutron (results in the main text).\n", "  The origin of the ultra-high-energy particles we receive on the Earth from\nthe outer space such as EeV cosmic rays and PeV neutrinos remains an enigma.\nAll mechanisms known to us currently make use of electromagnetic interaction to\naccelerate charged particles. In this paper we propose a mechanism exclusively\nbased on gravity rather than electromagnetic interaction. We show that it is\npossible to generate ultra-high-energy particles starting from particles with\nmoderate energies using the collisional Penrose process in an overspinning Kerr\nspacetime transcending the Kerr bound only by an infinitesimal amount, i.e.,\nwith the Kerr parameter $a=M(1+\\epsilon)$, where we take the limit $\\epsilon\n\\rightarrow 0^+$. We consider two massive particles starting from rest at\ninfinity that collide at $r=M$ with divergent center-of-mass energy and produce\ntwo massless particles. We show that massless particles produced in the\ncollision can escape to infinity with the ultra-high energies exploiting the\ncollisional Penrose process with the divergent efficiency $\\eta \\sim\n{1}/{\\sqrt{\\epsilon}} \\rightarrow \\infty$. Assuming the isotropic emission of\nmassless particles in the center-of-mass frame of the colliding particles, we\nshow that half of the particles created in the collisions escape to infinity\nwith the divergent energies. To a distant observer, ultra-high-energy particles\nappear to originate from a bright spot which is at the angular location $\\xi\n\\sim {2M}/{r_{obs}}$ with respect to the singularity on the side which is\nrotating towards the observer. We show that the anisotropy in emission in the\ncenter-of-mass frame, which is dictated by the differential cross-section of\nunderlying particle physics process, leaves a district signature on the\nspectrum of ultra-high-energy massless particles. Thus, it provides a unique\nprobe into fundamental particle physics.\n", "  Quantifying the concordance between different cosmological experiments is\nimportant for testing the validity of theoretical models and systematics in the\nobservations. In earlier work, we thus proposed the Surprise, a concordance\nmeasure derived from the relative entropy between posterior distributions. We\nrevisit the properties of the Surprise and describe how it provides a general,\nversatile, and robust measure for the agreement between datasets. We also\ncompare it to other measures of concordance that have been proposed for\ncosmology. As an application, we extend our earlier analysis and use the\nSurprise to quantify the agreement between WMAP 9, Planck 13 and Planck 15\nconstraints on the $\\Lambda$CDM model. Using a principle component analysis in\nparameter space, we find that the large Surprise between WMAP 9 and Planck 13\n(S = 17.6 bits, implying a deviation from consistency at 99.8% confidence) is\ndue to a shift along a direction that is dominated by the amplitude of the\npower spectrum. The Planck 15 constraints deviate from the Planck 13 results (S\n= 56.3 bits), primarily due to a shift in the same direction. The Surprise\nbetween WMAP and Planck consequently disappears when moving to Planck 15 (S =\n-5.1 bits). This means that, unlike Planck 13, Planck 15 is not in tension with\nWMAP 9. These results illustrate the advantages of the relative entropy and the\nSurprise for quantifying the disagreement between cosmological experiments and\nmore generally as an information metric for cosmology.\n", "  It is well known that a canonical scalar field is able to describe either\ndark matter or dark energy but not both. We demonstrate that a non-canonical\nscalar field can describe both dark matter and dark energy within a unified\nsetting. We consider the simplest extension of the canonical Lagrangian ${\\cal\nL} \\propto X^\\alpha - V(\\phi)$ where $\\alpha \\geq 1$ and $V$ is a sufficiently\nflat potential. In this case the kinetic term in the Lagrangian behaves just\nlike a perfect fluid, whereas the potential term mimicks the cosmological\nconstant. For very large values, $\\alpha \\gg 1$, the equation of state of the\nkinetic term drops to zero and the expansion rate of the universe mimicks\n$\\Lambda$CDM. The velocity of sound in this model, and the associated\ngravitational clustering, is sensitive to the value of $\\alpha$. For very large\nvalues of $\\alpha$ the clustering properties of our model resemble those of\ncold dark matter (CDM). But for smaller values of $\\alpha$, gravitational\nclustering on small scales is suppressed, and our model has properties\nresembling those of warm dark matter (WDM). Therefore our non-canonical model\nhas an interesting new property: while the background universe expands like\n$\\Lambda$CDM, its clustering properties can resemble those of either cold or\nwarm dark matter.\n", "  The necessity and utility of considering the interaction of a quantum system\nwith its environment when describing its time evolution have been recognized in\nseveral branches of physics and of other sciences. The Kraus' representation is\na general and succinct approach to describe such open system dynamics in a wide\nrange of relevant physical scenarios. In this article, by abdicating from the\ngenerality of the formalism of quantum operations and with this avoiding its\nassociated complications, we show in a simple manner how we can obtain the\nKraus' representation using basically the closed system (system plus\nenvironment) unitary dynamics and the partial trace function. The example of a\ntwo-level atom interacting with the vacuum of the electromagnetic field is\nregarded for the sake of instantiating this formalism, which is then applied to\nstudy the time evolution of the atom's quantum coherence.\n", "  The nature of the theta point for a polymer in two dimensions has long been\ndebated, with a variety of candidates put forward for the critical exponents.\nThis includes those derived by Duplantier and Saleur (DS) for an exactly\nsolvable model. We use a representation of the problem via the $CP^{N-1}$ sigma\nmodel in the limit $N \\rightarrow 1$ to determine the stability of this\ncritical point. First we prove that the DS critical exponents are robust, so\nlong as the polymer does not cross itself: they can arise in a generic lattice\nmodel, and do not require fine tuning. This resolves a longstanding theoretical\nquestion. However there is an apparent paradox: two different lattice models,\napparently both in the DS universality class, show different numbers of\nrelevant perturbations, apparently leading to contradictory conclusions about\nthe stability of the DS exponents. We explain this in terms of subtle\ndifferences between the two models, one of which is fine-tuned (and not\nstrictly in the DS universality class). Next, we allow the polymer to cross\nitself, as appropriate e.g. to the quasi-2D case. This introduces an additional\nindependent relevant perturbation, so we do not expect the DS exponents to\napply. The exponents in the case with crossings will be those of the generic\ntricritical $O(n)$ model at $n=0$, and different to the case without crossings.\nWe also discuss interesting features of the operator content of the $CP^{N-1}$\nmodel. Simple geometrical arguments show that two operators in this field\ntheory, with very different symmetry properties, have the same scaling\ndimension for any value of $N$ (equivalently, any value of the loop fugacity).\nAlso we argue that for any value of $N$ the $CP^{N-1}$ model has a marginal\nparity-odd operator which is related to the loops' winding angle.\n", "  We consider generic axially symmetric rotating spacetimes and examine\nparticle collisions in the ergoregion. The results are generic and agree with\nthose obtained in the particular case of the rotating Teo wormhole in N.\nTsukamoto and C. Bambi, Phys. Rev. D 91, 104040 (2015). It is shown that for\nsufficiently rapid rotation, the energy of a particle escaping to infinity can\nbecome arbitrary large (so-called super-Penrose process). Moreover, this energy\nis typically much larger than the center-of mass energy of colliding particles.\nIn this sense the situation differs radically from that for collisions near\nblack holes.\n", "  We investigate two-photon quantum interference in an opaque scattering medium\nthat intrinsically supports $10^6$ transmission channels. By adaptive spatial\nphase-modulation of the incident wavefronts, the photons are directed at\ntargeted speckle spots or output channels. From $10^3$ experimentally available\ncoupled channels, we select two channels and enhance their transmission, to\nrealize the equivalent of a fully programmable $2\\times2$ beam splitter. By\nsending pairs of single photons from a parametric down-conversion source\nthrough the opaque scattering medium, we observe two-photon quantum\ninterference. The programmed beam splitter need not fulfill energy conservation\nover the two selected output channels and hence could be non-unitary.\nConsequently, we have the freedom to tune the quantum interference from\nbunching (Hong-Ou-Mandel-like) to antibunching. Our results establish opaque\nscattering media as a platform for high-dimensional quantum interference that\nis notably relevant for boson sampling and physical-key-based authentication.\n", "  We study the problem of quantum-state tomography under the assumption that\nthe state of the system is close to pure. In this context, an efficient\nmeasurements that one typically formulates uniquely identify a pure state from\nwithin the set of other pure states. In general such measurements are not\nrobust in the presence of measurement noise and other imperfections, and\ntherefore are less practical for tomography. We argue here that state\ntomography experiments should instead be done using measurements that can\ndistinguish a pure state from {\\em any} other quantum state, of any rank. We\nshow that such nontrivial measurements follows from the physical constraint\nthat the density matrix is positive semidefinite and prove that these\nmeasurements yield a robust estimation of the state. We assert that one can\nimplement such tomography relatively simply by measuring only a few random\northonormal bases; our conjecture is supported by numerical evidence. These\nresults are generalized for estimation of states close to bounded-rank.\n", "  Topological classification in our previous paper [K. Shiozaki and M. Sato,\nPhys. Rev. B ${\\bf 90}$, 165114 (2014)] is extended to nonsymmorphic\ncrystalline insulators and superconductors. Using the twisted equivariant\n$K$-theory, we complete the classification of topological crystalline\ninsulators and superconductors in the presence of additional order-two\nnonsymmorphic space group symmetries. The order-two nonsymmorphic space groups\ninclude half lattice translation with $Z_2$ flip, glide, two-fold screw, and\ntheir magnetic space groups. We find that the topological periodic table shows\nmodulo-2 periodicity in the number of flipped coordinates under the order-two\nnonsymmorphic space group. It is pointed out that the nonsymmorphic space\ngroups allow $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological phases even in the absence of\ntime-reversal and/or particle-hole symmetries. Furthermore, the coexistence of\nthe nonsymmorphic space group with the time-reversal and/or particle-hole\nsymmetries provides novel $\\mathbb{Z}_4$ topological phases, which have not\nbeen realized in ordinary topological insulators and superconductors. We\npresent model Hamiltonians of these new topological phases and the analytic\nexpression of the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ and $\\mathbb{Z}_4$ topological invariants. The\nhalf lattice translation with $Z_2$ spin flip and glide symmetry are compatible\nwith the existence of the boundary, leading to topological surface gapless\nmodes protected by such order-two nonsymmorphic symmetries. We also discuss\nunique features of these gapless surface modes.\n", "  With proper profiles of the scalar potential and the dilaton field, for the\nfirst time, the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in the vacuum and its\nrestoration at finite temperature are correctly realized in the holographic QCD\nframework. In the chiral limit, a nonzero chiral condensate develops in the\nvacuum and decreases with temperature, and the phase transition is of 2nd order\nfor two-flavor case and of 1st order for three-flavor case. In the case of\nexplicit chiral symmetry breaking, in two-flavor case, the 2nd order phase\ntransition turns to crossover with any nonzero current quark mass, and in\nthree-flavor case, the 1st order phase transition turns to crossover at a\nfinite current quark mass. The correct description of chiral symmetry breaking\nand restoration makes the holographic QCD models more powerful in dealing with\nnon-perturbative QCD phenomena. This framework can be regarded as a general set\nup in application of AdS/CFT to describe conventional Ginzburg-Landau-Wilson\ntype phase transitions, e.g. in condensed matter and cosmology systems.\n", "  The actuator line model (ALM) is a commonly used method to represent lifting\nsurfaces such as wind turbine blades within Large-Eddy Simulations (LES). In\nthe ALM the lift and drag forces are replaced by an imposed body force which is\ntypically smoothed over several grid points using a Gaussian kernel with some\nprescribed smoothing width $\\epsilon$. To date, the choice of $\\epsilon$ has\nmost often been based on numerical considerations related to the grid spacing\nused in LES. However, especially for finely resolved LES with grid spacings on\nthe order of or smaller than the chord-length of the blade, the best choice of\n$\\epsilon$ is not known. In this work, a theoretical approach is followed to\ndetermine the most suitable value of $\\epsilon$. Firstly, we develop an\nanalytical solution to the linearized flow response to a Gaussian lift and drag\nforce and use the results to establish a relationship between the local and\nfar-field velocity required to specify lift and drag forces. Then, focusing\nfirst on the lift force, we find $\\epsilon$ and the force center location that\nminimize the square difference between the velocity fields induced by the\nGaussian force and 2D potential flow over Joukowski airfoils. We find that the\noptimal smoothing width $\\epsilon^{\\rm opt}$ is on the order of 14-25\\% of the\nchord length of the blade, and the center of force is located at about 13-26\\%\ndownstream of the leading edge of the blade, for the cases considered. These\noptimal values do not depend on angle of attack and depend only weakly on the\ntype of lifting surface. To represent the drag force, the optimal width of the\ncircular Gaussian drag force field is shown to be equal to the momentum\nthickness of the wake.\n", "  The rapid development of high brilliance X-ray radiation sources is\nrevolutionizing physics, chemistry, and biology research through their novel\napplications. Another breakthrough is anticipated with the construction of\nnext-generation laser facilities which will operate at intensities beyond\n$10^{23}$ $\\mathrm{W/cm^2}$, leading to higher yield, shorter wavelength\nradiation sources. We use numerical simulations to demonstrate that a source of\ncollimated multi-MeV photons with conversion efficiency comparable to the one\nexpected for these facilities is achievable at an order of magnitude lower in\nintensity, within reach of the existing facilities. In the optimal setup, the\nlaser pulse irradiates a bulk solid-density target, heating the target\nelectrons and inducing relativistic transparency. As the pulse then propagates,\nit generates a beam of energetic electrons which in turn drives a strong\nazimuthal magnetic field. This field significantly enhances the radiation\nreaction for the electrons, yielding tens of TW of directed MeV photons for a\nPW-class laser.\n", "  Topological insulators are a novel class of quantum matter with a gapped\ninsulating bulk yet gapless spin helical Dirac fermion conducting surface\nstates. Here, we report local and non-local electrical and magneto transport\nmeasurements in dual-gated BiSbTeSe2 thin film topological insulator devices,\nwith conduction dominated by the spatially separated top and bottom surfaces,\neach hosting a single species of Dirac fermions with independent gate control\nover the carrier type and density. We observe many intriguing quantum transport\nphenomena in such a fully-tunable two-species topological Dirac gas, including\na zero-magnetic-field minimum conductivity close to twice the conducatance\nquantum at the double Dirac point, a series of ambipolar two-component\nhalf-integer Dirac quantum Hall states and an electron-hole total filling\nfactor zero state (with a zero-Hall plateau), exhibiting dissipationless\n(chiral) and dissipative (non-chiral) edge conduction respectively. Such a\nsystem paves the way to explore rich physics ranging from topological\nmagnetoelectric effects to exciton condensation.\n", "  Motivated by the importance of non-collinear and non-coplanar magnetic phases\nin determining various electrical properties of magnetic materials, we\ninvestigate the phase diagrams of the extended Hubbard model on anisotropic\ntriangular lattice. We make use of a mean-field scheme that treats collinear,\nnon-collinear and non-coplanar phases on equal footing. In addition to the\nferromagnetic and 120{\\deg} antiferromagnetic phases, we find the\nfour-sublattice flux, the 3Q non-coplanar and the non-collinear charge-ordered\nstates to be stable at specific values of filling fraction $n$. Inter-site\nCoulomb repulsion leads to intriguing spin-charge ordered phases. Most notable\nof these are the collinear and non-collinear magnetic states at $n=2/3$, which\noccur together with a pinball-liquid-like charge order. Our results demonstrate\nthat the elementary single-orbital extended Hubbard model on a triangular\nlattice hosts unconventional spin-charge ordered phases, which have been\nreported in more complex and material-specific electronic Hamiltonians relevant\nto layered triangular systems.\n", "  Recently, a series of articles by Combes et al. has shown that it was\npossible to greatly improve the measurement rate of a register of qubits for\ngiven detector resources by means of a clever feedback control scheme. However,\nthis speed-up came at an exponential cost in terms of complexity and memory\nuse. In this article, I propose a simple efficient algorithm --exponentially\nmore frugal in memory and less complex to implement-- which is asymptotically\nas fast. I use extensively the implicit classicality of the situation to\nprovide a slightly more straightforward interpretation of the results. I\ncompute the speed-up rates exactly in the case of the proposed model and in the\ncase of the open-loop scheme of Combes et al. and prove that they indeed\nprovide the same asymptotic speed-up.\n", "  A periodically driven quantum system, when coupled to a heat bath, relaxes to\na non-equilibrium asymptotic state. In the general situation, the retrieval of\nthis asymptotic state presents a rather non-trivial task. It was recently shown\nthat in the limit of an infinitesimal coupling, using so-called rotating wave\napproximation (RWA), and under strict conditions imposed on the time-dependent\nsystem Hamiltonian, the asymptotic state can attain the Gibbs form. A\nFloquet-Gibbs state is characterized by a density matrix which is diagonal in\nthe Floquet basis of the system Hamiltonian with the diagonal elements obeying\na Gibbs distribution, being parametrized by the corresponding Floquet\nquasi-energies. Addressing the non-adiabatic driving regime, upon using the\nMagnus expansion, we employ the concept of a corresponding effective Floquet\nHamiltonian. In doing so we go beyond the conventionally used RWA and\ndemonstrate that the idea of Floquet-Gibbs states can be extended to the\nrealistic case of a weak, although finite system-bath coupling, herein termed\neffective Floquet-Gibbs states.\n", "  We present a general model of qubit dynamics which entails pure dephasing and\ndissipative time-local master equations. This allows us to describe the\ncombined effect of thermalisation and dephasing beyond the usual Markovian\napproximation. We investigate the complete positivity conditions and introduce\na heuristic model that is always physical and provides the correct Markovian\nlimit. We study the effects of temperature on the non-Markovian behaviour of\nthe system and show that the noise additivity property discussed by Yu and\nEberly in Ref. [1] holds beyond the Markovian limit.\n", "  Wide field images taken in several photometric bands allow simultaneous\nmeasurement of redshifts for thousands of galaxies. A variety of algorithms to\nmake this measurement have appeared in the last few years, the majority of\nwhich can be classified as either template or training based methods. Among the\nlatter, nearest neighbour estimatorsstand out as one of the most successful, in\nterms of both precision and the quality of error estimation. In this paper we\ndescribe the Directional Neighbourhood Fitting (DNF) algorithm based on the\nfollowing: a new neighbourhood metric (Directional Neighbourhood), a photo-z\nestimation strategy (Neighbourhood Fitting) and a method for generating the\nphoto-z probability distribution function. We compare DNF with other well-known\nempirical photometric redshift tools using different public datasets (Sloan\nDigital Sky Survey, VIMOS VLT Deep Survey and Photo-z Accuracy Testing). DNF\nachieves high-quality results with reliable error.\n", "  We study the confinement-deconfinement phase transition of pure Yang-Mills\ntheories at finite temperature using a simple massive extension of standard\nbackground field methods. We generalize our recent next-to-leading-order\nperturbative calculation of the Polyakov loop and of the related background\nfield effective potential for the SU(2) theory to any compact and connex Lie\ngroup with a simple Lie algebra. We discuss in detail the SU(3) theory, where\nthe two-loop corrections yield improved values for the first-order transition\ntemperature as compared to the one-loop result. We also show that certain\none-loop artifacts of thermodynamical observables disappear at two-loop order,\nas was already the case for the SU(2) theory. In particular, the entropy and\nthe pressure are positive for all temperatures. Finally, we discuss the groups\nSU(4) and Sp(2) which shed interesting light, respectively, on the relation\nbetween the (de)confinement of static matter sources in the various\nrepresentations of the gauge group and on the use of the background field\nitself as an order parameter for confinement. In both cases, we obtain\nfirst-order transitions, in agreement with lattice simulations and other\ncontinuum approaches.\n", "  We study zero-temperature hysteresis in the random-field Ising model on a\nBethe lattice where a fraction $c$ of the sites have coordination number $z=4$\nwhile the remaining fraction $1-c$ have $z=3$. Numerical simulations as well as\nprobabilistic methods are used to show the existence of critical hysteresis for\nall values of $c > 0$. This extends earlier results for $c=0$ and $c=1$ to the\nentire range $0 \\le c \\le 1$, and provides new insight in non-equilibrium\ncritical phenomena.\n", "  A large obstacle for realizing quantum photonic logic is the weak optical\nnonlinearity of available materials, which results in large power consumption.\nIn this paper, we present the theoretical design of all-optical logic with\nsecond order ($\\chi^{(2)}$) nonlinear bimodal cavities and their networks.\nUsing semiclassical models derived from the Wigner quasi-probability\ndistribution function, we analyze the power consumption and signal-to-noise\nratio (SNR) of networks implementing an optical AND gate and an optical latch.\nComparison between the second and third order $(\\chi^{(3)})$ optical logic\nreveals that while the $\\chi^{(3)}$ design outperforms the $\\chi^{(2)}$ design\nin terms of the SNR for the same input power, employing the $\\chi^{(3)}$\nnonlinearity necessitates the use of cavities with ultra high quality factors\n($Q\\sim 10^6$) to achieve gate power consumption comparable to that of the\n$\\chi^{(2)}$ design at significantly smaller quality factors ($Q \\sim 10^4$).\nUsing realistic estimates of the $\\chi^{(2)}$ and $\\chi^{(3)}$ nonlinear\nsusceptibilities of available materials, we show that at achievable quality\nfactors ($Q \\sim 10^4$), the $\\chi^{(2)}$ design is an order of magnitude more\nenergy efficient than the corresponding $\\chi^{(3)}$ design.\n", "  The additivity principle (AP) allows to compute the current distribution in\nmany one-dimensional (1d) nonequilibrium systems. Here we extend this\nconjecture to general d-dimensional driven diffusive systems, and validate its\npredictions against both numerical simulations of rare events and microscopic\nexact calculations of three paradigmatic models of diffusive transport in d=2.\nCrucially, the existence of a structured current vector field at the\nfluctuating level, coupled to the local mobility, turns out to be essential to\nunderstand current statistics in d>1. We prove that, when compared to the\nstraightforward extension of the AP to high-d, the so-called weak AP always\nyields a better minimizer of the macroscopic fluctuation theory action for\ncurrent statistics.\n", "  Theories of gravity with a preferred foliation usually display arbitrarily\nfast signal propagation, changing the black hole definition. A new inescapable\nbarrier, the universal horizon, has been defined and many static and\nspherically symmetric examples have been studied in the literature. Here, we\ntranslate the usual definition of the universal horizon in terms of an optical\nscalar built with the preferred flow defined by the preferred spacetime\nfoliation. The new expression has the advantages of being of quasilocal nature\nand independent of specific spacetime symmetries in order to be well defined.\nTherefore, we propose it as a definition for general quasilocal universal\nhorizons. Using the new formalism we show that there are no universal analog of\ncosmological horizons for FLRW models for any scale factor function, and we\nalso state that quasilocal universal horizons are restricted to trapped regions\nof the spacetime. Using the evolution equation, we analyze the formation of\nuniversal horizons under a truncated Horava-Lifshitz theory, in spherical\nsymmetry, showing the existence of regions in parameter space where the\nuniversal horizon formation cannot be smooth from the center, under some\nphysically reasonable assumptions. We conclude with our view on the next steps\nfor the understanding of black holes in nonrelativistic gravity theories.\n", "  We observe interference in the light scattered from trapped $^{40}$Ca$^+$ ion\ncrystals. By varying the intensity of the excitation laser, we study the\ninfluence of elastic and inelastic scattering on the visibility of the fringe\npattern and discriminate its effect from that of the ion temperature and\nwave-packet localization. In this way we determine the complex degree of\ncoherence and the mutual coherence of light fields produced by individual\natoms. We obtain interference fringes from crystals consisting of two, three\nand four ions in a harmonic trap. Control of the trapping potential allows for\nthe adjustment of the interatomic distances and thus the formation of linear\narrays of atoms serving as a regular grating of microscopic scatterers.\n", "  Is Cosmic Censorship special to General Relativity, or can it survive a\nviolation of equivalence principle? Recent studies have shown that\nsingularities in Lorentz violating Einstein-Aether (or Horava-Lifhsitz)\ntheories can lie behind a universal horizon in simple black hole spacetimes.\nEven infinitely fast signals cannot escape these universal horizons. We extend\nthis result, for an incompressible aether, to 3+1d dynamical or spinning\nspacetimes which possess inner killing horizons, and show that a universal\nhorizon always forms in between the outer and (would-be) inner horizons. This\nfinding suggests a notion of Cosmic Censorship, given that geometry in these\ntheories never evolves beyond the universal horizon (avoiding potentially\nsingular inner killing horizons). A surprising result is that there are 3\ndistinct possible stationary universal horizons for a spinning black hole, only\none of which matches the dynamical spherical solution. This motivates dynamical\nstudies of collapse in Einstein-Aether theories beyond spherical symmetry,\nwhich may reveal instabilities around the spherical solution.\n", "  We study a class of Dirac semimetals that feature an eightfold-degenerate\ndouble Dirac point. We show that 7 of the 230 space groups can host such Dirac\npoints and argue that they all generically display linear dispersion. We\nintroduce an explicit tight-binding model for space groups 130 and 135, showing\nthat 135 can host an intrinsic double Dirac semimetal -- one with no additional\ndegeneracies at the Fermi energy. We consider symmetry-lowering perturbations\nand show that uniaxial compressive strain in different directions leads to\ntopologically distinct insulating phases. In addition, the double Dirac\nsemimetal can accommodate topological line defects that bind helical modes.\nPotential materials realizations are discussed.\n", "  Visibility algorithms transform time series into graphs and encode dynamical\ninformation in their topology, paving the way for graph-theoretical time series\nanalysis as well as building a bridge between nonlinear dynamics and network\nscience. In this work we introduce and study the concept of sequential\nvisibility graph motifs, smaller substructures of n consecutive nodes that\nappear with characteristic frequencies. We develop a theory to compute in an\nexact way the motif profiles associated to general classes of deterministic and\nstochastic dynamics. We find that this simple property is indeed a highly\ninformative and computationally efficient feature capable to distinguish among\ndifferent dynamics and robust against noise contamination. We finally confirm\nthat it can be used in practice to perform unsupervised learning, by extracting\nmotif profiles from experimental heart-rate series and being able, accordingly,\nto disentangle meditative from other relaxation states. Applications of this\ngeneral theory include the automatic classification and description of\nphysical, biological, and financial time series.\n", "  Certain inflationary models as well as realisations of phase transitions in\nthe early Universe predict the formation of primordial black holes. For most\nmass ranges, the fraction of matter in the form of primordial black holes is\nlimited by many different observations on various scales. Primordial black\nholes are assumed to be formed when overdensities that cross the horizon have\nSchwarzschild radii larger than the horizon. Traditionally it was therefore\nassumed that primordial black-hole masses were equal to the horizon mass at\ntheir time of formation. However, detailed calculations of their collapse show\nthat primordial black holes formed at each point in time should rather form a\nspectrum of different masses, obeying critical scaling. Though this has been\nknown for more than fifteen years, the effect of this scaling behaviour is\nlargely ignored when considering predictions for primordial black hole mass\nspectra. In this paper we consider the critical collapse scaling for a variety\nof models which produce primordial black holes, and find that it generally\nleads to a shift, broadening and an overall decrease of the mass contained in\nprimordial black holes. This effect is model and parameter dependent and cannot\nbe contained by a constant rescaling of the spectrum; it can become important\nand should be taken into account when comparing to observational constraints.\n", "  We present a lattice calculation of the neutron and proton electric dipole\nmoments (EDM's) with $N_f=2+1$ flavors of domain-wall fermions. The neutron and\nproton EDM form factors are extracted from three-point functions at the\nnext-to-leading order in the $\\theta$ vacuum of QCD. In this computation, we\nuse pion masses 0.33 and 0.42 GeV and 2.7 fm$^3$ lattices with Iwasaki gauge\naction and a 0.17 GeV pion and 4.6 fm$^3$ lattice with I-DSDR gauge action, all\ngenerated by the RBC and UKQCD collaborations. The all-mode-averaging technique\nenables an efficient and high statistics calculation. Chiral behavior of\nlattice EDM's is discussed in the context of baryon chiral perturbation theory.\nIn addition, we also show numerical evidence on relationship of three- and\ntwo-point correlation function with local topological distribution.\n", "  The electronic structure of the Cr(001) surface with its sharp resonance at\nthe Fermi level is a subject of controversial debate of many experimental and\ntheoretical works. To date, it is unclear whether the origin of this resonance\nis an orbital Kondo or an electron-phonon coupling effect. We have combined ab\ninitio density functional calculations with dynamical mean-field simulations to\ncalculate the orbitally resolved spectral function of the Cr(001) surface. The\ncalculated orbital character and shape of the spectrum is in agreement with\ndata from (inverse) photoemission experiments. We find that dynamic electron\ncorrelations crucially influence the surface electronic structure and lead to a\nlow energy resonance in the $d_{z^2}$ and $d_{xz/yz}$ orbitals. Our results\nhelp to reconvene controversial experimental results from (I)PES and STM\nmeasurements.\n", "  We present a first-principles study of the cross-plane thermal conductivity\n$\\kappa_{\\perp}$ in a wide variety of semiconductor thin films. We introduce a\nsimple suppression model that matches variance-reduced Monte Carlo simulations\nwith ab-initio phonon dispersions and scattering rates within $\\leq 5\\%$ even\nfor anisotropic compounds. This, in turn, enables accurate $\\kappa_{\\perp}$\nreconstruction from tabulated cumulative conductivity curves\n$\\kappa_{\\Sigma}(\\Lambda_{\\perp})$. We furthermore reveal, and explain, a\ndistinct quasiballistic regime characterised by a fractional thickness\ndependence $\\kappa_{\\perp} \\sim L^{2-\\alpha}$ in alloys (where $\\alpha$ is the\nL\\'evy exponent) and logarithmic dependence $\\kappa_{\\perp} \\sim \\ln(L)$ in\nsingle crystals. These observations culminate in the formulation of two compact\nparametric forms for $\\kappa_{\\perp}(L)$ that can fit the first-principles\ncurves across the entire ballistic-diffusive range within a few percent for all\ninvestigated compounds.\n", "  Asymptotic safety is an attractive scenario for the dynamics of quantum\nspacetime. Here, we work from a phenomenologically motivated point of view and\nemphasize that a viable dynamics for quantum gravity in our universe must\naccount for the existence of matter. In particular, we explore the\nscale-dependence of a scalar matter-gravity-vertex, and investigate whether an\ninteracting fixed point exists for the so-defined Newton coupling. We find a\nviable fixed point in the pure-gravity system, disregarding scalar quantum\nfluctuations. We explore its extensions to the case with dynamical scalars, and\nfind indications of asymptotic safety in the matter-gravity system. We moreover\nexamine the anomalous dimensions for different components of the metric\nfluctuations, and find significant differences between the transverse traceless\nand scalar component.\n", "  We investigate the decay of condensates of scalars in a field theory defined\nby $V({\\cal A})=m{}^2\\,f{}^2\\,[1-\\cos({\\cal A}\\,/\\,f)]$, where $m$ and $f$ are\nthe mass and decay constant of the scalar field. An example of such a theory is\nthat of the axion, in which case the condensates are called axion stars. The\naxion field, $\\cal A$, is self adjoint. As a result the axion number is not an\nabsolutely conserved quantity. Therefore, axion stars are not stable and have\nfinite lifetimes. Bound axions, localized on the volume of the star, have a\ncoordinate uncertainty $\\Delta x \\sim R \\sim 1/(m_a \\Delta)$, where $R$ is the\nradius of the star and $\\Delta = \\sqrt{1-E_0{}^2\\,/\\,m_a^2}$. Here $m_a$ and\n$E_0$ are the mass, and the ground state energy of the bound axion. Then the\nmomentum distribution of axions has a width of $\\Delta p\\sim m_a\\,\\Delta$. At\nstrong binding, $\\Delta={\\cal O}(1)$, bound axions can easily transfer a\nsufficient amount of momentum to create and emit a free axion, leading to fast\ndecay of the star with a transition rate $\\Gamma \\sim m_a$. However, when\n$\\Delta\\ll 1$, the momentum distribution is more restricted, and as shown in\nthis paper, the transition rate for creating a free axion decreases as $\\exp\n(-p \\, \\Delta x) \\sim \\exp (-\\Delta^{-1})$. Then sufficiently large, weakly\nbound axion stars, produced after the big bang, survive until the present time.\nWe plot the region of their stability, limited by decay through axion loss and\nby gravitational instability, as a function of the mass of the axion and the\nmass of the star.\n", "  The string sigma model in $AdS_3\\times S^3$ supported by mixed three-form\nfluxes has recently been proved to be integrable which led to a plethora of\nwork in this background including proposals for S matrix and study of\nsemiclassical string profiles. Motivated by this, in this paper, we present a\nstudy of `spiky' strings in this background. We analyze the string profiles in\ndetail and also find the dispersion relation between the charges in the `long'\nstring limit after solving the equations of motion perturbatively upto the\nleading order in the Neveu-Schwarz flux $b$. We find that the dispersion for 2\nspikes gets corrected by the term $-\\frac{b^2}{2}\\log S$. We also discuss the\nfate of the solution in the limit of pure NS-NS flux.\n", "  We study here the $\\Lambda_b^0 \\to J/\\psi p \\pi^-$ reaction in analogy to the\n$\\Lambda^0_b \\to J/\\psi p K^-$ one, and we note that in both decays there is a\nsharp structure (dip or peak) in the $J/\\psi p$ mass distribution around $4450$\nMeV, which is associated in the $\\Lambda^0_b \\to J/\\psi p K^-$ experiment to an\nexotic pentaquark baryonic state, although in $\\Lambda_b^0 \\to J/\\psi p \\pi^-$\nit shows up with relatively low statistics. We analyze the $\\Lambda^0_b \\to\nJ/\\psi p \\pi^-$ interaction along the same lines as the $\\Lambda^0_b \\to J/\\psi\np K^-$ one, with the main difference stemming from the reduced Cabibbo strength\nin the former and the consideration of the $\\pi^-p$ final state interaction\ninstead of the $K^-p$ one. We find that with a minimal input, introducing the\n$\\pi^-p$ and $J/\\psi p$ interaction in $S$-wave with realistic interactions,\nand the empirical $P$-wave and $D$-wave contributions, one can accomplish a\nqualitative description of the $\\pi^-p$ and $J/\\psi p$ mass distributions. More\nimportantly, the peak structure followed by a dip of the experimental $J/\\psi\np$ mass distribution is reproduced with the same input as used to describe the\ndata of $\\Lambda^0_b\\rightarrow J/\\psi p K^-$ reaction. The repercussion for\nthe triangular singularity mechanism, invoked in some works to explain the\npentaquark peak, is discussed.\n", "  Here, we present the World Trade Atlas 1870-2013, a collection of annual\nworld trade maps in which distance combines economic size and the different\ndimensions that affect international trade beyond mere geography. Trade\ndistances, which are based on a gravity model predicting the existence of\nsignificant trade channels, are such that the closer countries are in trade\nspace, the greater their chance of becoming connected. The atlas provides us\nwith information regarding the long-term evolution of the international trade\nsystem and demonstrates that, in terms of trade, the world is not flat but\nhyperbolic, as a reflection of its complex architecture. The departure from\nflatness has been increasing since World War I, meaning that differences in\ntrade distances are growing and trade networks are becoming more hierarchical.\nSmaller-scale economies are moving away from other countries except for the\nlargest economies; meanwhile those large economies are increasing their chances\nof becoming connected worldwide. At the same time, Preferential Trade\nAgreements do not fit in perfectly with natural communities within the trade\nspace and have not necessarily reduced internal trade barriers. We discuss an\ninterpretation in terms of globalization, hierarchization, and localization;\nthree simultaneous forces that shape the international trade system.\n", "  We present a theory of quantum tunneling between 2D layers with account for\nRashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit interaction (SOI) in the layers. Energy and\nmomentum conservation results in a single resonant peak in the tunnel\nconductance between two 2D layers as has been experimentally observed for two\nquantum wells (QW) in GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructures. The account for SOI in the\nlayers leads to a complex pattern in the tunneling characteristic with typical\nfeatures corresponding to SOI energy. For this manifestation of SOI to be\nobserved experimentally the characteristic energy should exceed the resonant\nbroadening related to the particles quantum lifetime in the layers. We perform\nan accurate analysis of the known experimental data on electron and hole 2D-2D\ntunneling in AlGaAs/GaAs heterostructures. It appears that for the electron\ntunneling the manifestation of SOI is difficult to observe, but for the holes\ntunneling the parameters of the real structures used in the experiments are\nvery close to those required by the resolution criteria. We also consider a new\npromising candidate for the effect to be observed, that is p-doped SiGe\nstrained heterostructures. The reported parameters of cubic Rashba SOI and\nquantum lifetime in strained Ge QWs fabricated up to date already match the\ncriteria for observing SOI in 2D-2D heavy holes tunneling. As supported by our\ncalculations small adjustments of the parameters for AlGaAs/GaAs p-type QWs or\nsimply designing a 2D-2D tunneling experiment for SiGe case are very likely to\nreveal the SOI features in the 2D-2D tunneling.\n", "  Mirroring their role in electrical and optical physics, two-dimensional\ncrystals are emerging as novel platforms for fluid separations and water\ndesalination, which are hydrodynamic processes that occur in nanoscale\nenvironments. For numerical simulation to play a predictive and descriptive\nrole, one must have theoretically sound methods that span orders of magnitude\nin physical scales, from the atomistic motions of particles inside the channels\nto the large-scale hydrodynamic gradients that drive transport. Here, we use\nconstraint dynamics to derive a nonequilibrium molecular dynamics method for\nsimulating steady-state mass flow of a fluid moving through the nanoscopic\nspaces of a porous solid. After validating our method on a model system, we use\nit to study the hydrophobic effect of water moving through pores of\nelectrically doped single-layer graphene. The trend in permeability that we\ncalculate does not follow the hydrophobicity of the membrane, but is instead\ngoverned by a crossover between two competing molecular transport mechanisms.\n", "  We construct a large class of vacuum solutions of the Einstein equations\nwithout any symmetries and with controlled asymptotics near a timelike\nsingularity. The solutions are obtained by a Fuchs analysis of the equations\nwhich evolve the metric in a spacelike direction.\n  We further observe that the changes of signs of some of the terms (walls) in\nthe associated Hamiltonian invalidate the \"cosmological billards\" heuristic\narguments for existence of singularities of mixmaster type in the current\ncontext.\n", "  We present a new algorithm to reconstruct the Galactic free electron density\nfrom pulsar dispersion measures. The algorithm performs a nonparametric\ntomography for a density field with an arbitrary amount of degrees of freedom.\nIt is based on approximating the Galactic free electron density as the product\nof a profile function with a statistically isotropic and homogeneous log-normal\nfield. Under this approximation the algorithm generates a map of the free\nelectron density as well as an uncertainty estimate without the need of\ninformation about the power spectrum. The uncertainties of the pulsar distances\nare treated consistently by an iterative procedure. We test the algorithm using\nthe NE2001 model with modified fluctuations as a Galaxy model, pulsar\npopulations generated from the Lorimer population model, and mock observations\nemulating the upcoming Square Kilometer Array. We show the quality of the\nreconstruction for mock data sets containing between 1000 and 10000 pulsars\nwith distance uncertainties up to 25%. Our results show, that with the SKA\nnonparametric tomography of the Galactic free electron density becomes\nfeasible, but the quality of the reconstruction is very sensitive to the\ndistance uncertainties.\n", "  We extend the Generalised Langevin Equation (GLE) method [Phys. Rev. B 89,\n134303 (2014)] to model a central classical region connected to two realistic\nthermal baths at two different temperatures. In such nonequilibrium conditions\na heat flow is established, via the central system, in between the two baths.\nThe GLE-2B (GLE two baths) scheme permits us to have a realistic description of\nboth the dissipative central system and its surrounding baths. Following the\noriginal GLE approach, the extended Langevin dynamics scheme is modified to\ntake into account two sets of auxiliary degrees of freedom corresponding to the\nmapping of the vibrational properties of each bath. These auxiliary variables\nare then used to solve the non-Markovian dissipative dynamics of the central\nregion. The resulting algorithm is used to study a model of a short Al nanowire\nconnected to two baths. The results of the simulations using the GLE-2B\napproach are compared to the results of other simulations that were carried out\nusing standard thermostatting approaches (based on Markovian Langevin and\nNose-Hoover thermostats). We concentrate on the steady state regime and study\nthe establishment of a local temperature profile within the system. The\nconditions for obtaining a flat profile or a temperature gradient are examined\nin detail, in agreement with earlier studies. The results show that the GLE-2B\napproach is able to treat, within a single scheme, two widely different thermal\ntransport regimes, i.e. ballistic systems, with no temperature gradient, and\ndiffusive systems with a temperature gradient.\n", "  We explicitly confirm that spatially flat non-singular bouncing cosmologies\nmake sense as effective theories. The presence of a non-singular bounce in a\nspatially flat universe implies a temporary violation of the null energy\ncondition, which can be achieved through a phase of ghost condensation. We\ncalculate the scale of strong coupling and demonstrate that the\nghost-condensate bounce remains trustworthy throughout, and that all\nperturbation modes within the regime of validity of the effective description\nremain under control. For this purpose we require the perturbed action up to\nthird order in perturbations, which we calculate in both flat and co-moving\ngauge -- since these two gauges allow us to highlight different physical\naspects. Our conclusion is that there exist healthy descriptions of\nnon-singular bouncing cosmologies providing a viable resolution of the big-bang\nsingularities in cosmological models. Our results also suggest a variant of\nekpyrotic cosmology, in which entropy perturbations are generated during the\ncontracting phase, but are only converted into curvature perturbations after\nthe bounce.\n", "  In this paper, we have proposed a \\v{C}erenkov free-electron laser (CFEL)\nwith metallic side walls, which are used to confine an electromagnetic surface\nmode supported by a thin dielectric slab placed on top of a conducting surface.\nThis leads to an enhancement in coupling between the optical mode and the\nco-propagating electron beam, and consequently, performance of the CFEL is\nimproved. We set up coupled Maxwell-Lorentz equations for the system, in\nanalogy with an undulator based conventional FEL, and obtain formulas for the\nsmall-signal gain and growth rate. It is shown that small signal gain and\ngrowth rate in this configuration are larger compared to the configuration\nwithout the side walls. In the nonlinear regime, we solve the coupled\nMaxwell-Lorentz equations numerically and study the saturation behaviour of the\nsystem. It is found that the \\v{C}erenkov FEL with side walls saturates\nquickly, and produces powerful coherent terahertz radiation.\n", "  Competition between superconductivity and disorder plays an essential role in\nunderstanding the metal-insulator transition. Based on the Bogoliubov-de Gennes\nequation, we studied an s-wave superconductor with both spin-orbit coupling and\ndisorder are presented. With increasing the strength of disorder, the mean\nsuperconducting order parameter will vanish while the energy gap will persist,\nwhich indicates that the system undergoes a transition from a superconducting\nstate to an insulating state. This can be confirmed by calculating the inverse\nparticipation ratio. We also find that, if the strength of disorder is small,\nthe superconducting order parameter and the energy gap will decrease if we\nincrease the strength of spin-orbit coupling and Zeeman field. In the large\ndisorder limits, increasing the strength of spin-orbit coupling will increase\nthe mean superconducting order parameter. This phenomenon shows that the system\nis more insensitive to disorder if the spin-orbit coupling is presented.\nNumerical computing also shows that the whole system breaks up into several\nsuperconducting islands instead of being superconductivity.\n", "  We present a self-contained discussion of the universality classes of the\ngeneralized epidemic process (GEP) on Poisson random networks, which is a\nsimple model of social contagions with cooperative effects. These effects lead\nto rich phase transitional behaviors that include continuous and discontinuous\ntransitions with tricriticality in between. With the help of a comprehensive\nfinite-size scaling theory, we numerically confirm static and dynamic scaling\nbehaviors of the GEP near continuous phase transitions and at tricriticality,\nwhich verifies the field-theoretical results of previous studies. We also\npropose a proper criterion for the discontinuous transition line, which is\nshown to coincide with the bond percolation threshold.\n", "  We derive the exact mass-coupling relation of the simplest multi-scale\nquantum integrable model, i.e., the homogeneous sine-Gordon model with two mass\nscales. The relation is obtained by comparing the perturbed conformal field\ntheory description of the model valid at short distances to the large distance\nbootstrap description based on the model's integrability. In particular, we\nfind a differential equation for the relation by constructing conserved tensor\ncurrents which satisfy a generalization of the $\\Theta$ sum rule Ward identity.\nThe mass-coupling relation is written in terms of hypergeometric functions.\n", "  A lepto-baryonic left-right symmetric theory is considered along with\npointing out stable dark matter candidates whose stability is ensured\nautomatically where leptons and baryons are defined as local gauge symmetries.\nThese theories are generally anomalous and the possible gauge anomaly free\nsolutions for these theories are presented. It is found that the neutral\ncomponent of fermion triplets can be a viable dark matter candidate originally\nintroduced for gauge anomaly cancellation. The other dark matter possibilities\nwithin this lepto-baryonic left-right symmetric theory are also presented.\n", "  We study the electromagnetic properties of Weyl semimetals with strong\ninteractions. Focusing on a single Weyl cone in the band structure, we induce\nstrong interactions by coupling the Weyl fermion with a tunable coupling\nconstant $g_f$ to a quantum critical system. The critical fluctuations are\ndescribed by a conformal field theory containing fermionic operators with\nscaling dimension $\\Delta$. Employing the methods of the holographic\ncorrespondence, we then derive the effective theory of the Weyl fermion in the\npresence of external electric and magnetic fields. In particular, we determine\nthe frequency and momentum-dependent anomalous magnetic moment of the Weyl\nfermions. We also determine the conductivity of the Weyl semimetal including\nthe vertex corrections consistent with the Ward identity. Finally, we connect\nour construction to the case of Coulomb interactions in Weyl semimetals by\ntuning the parameters $\\Delta \\rightarrow 5/2$ and $g_f^2 \\rightarrow\ne/\\sqrt{\\hbar c\\epsilon_0$.\n", "  By comparing 3 constituents of Orion A (gas, protostars, and\npre-main-sequence stars), both morhologically and kinematically, we derive the\nfollowing. The gas surface density near the integral-shaped filament (ISF) is\nwell represented by a power law, Sigma(b)=72 Msun/pc^2(b/pc)^{-5/8} for our\nentire range, 0.05<b/pc<8.5, of distance from the filament ridge. Essentially\nall protostars lie on the ISF or other filament ridges, while almost all\npre-main-sequence stars do not. Combined with the fact that protostars move <1\nkms relative to the filaments while stars move several times faster, this\nimplies that protostellar accretion is terminated by a slingshot ejection from\nthe filaments. The ISF is the 3rd in a series of star bursts that are\nprogressively moving south, with separations of a few Myr in time and 3 pc in\nspace. This, combined with the filament's observed undulations (spatial and\nvelocity), suggests that repeated propagation of transverse waves thru the\nfilament is progressively digesting the material that formerly connected Orion\nA and B into stars in discrete episodes. We construct an axially symmetric gas\ndensity profile rho(r)=16 Msun/pc^3(r/pc)^{-13/8}. The model implies that the\nobserved magnetic fields are supercritical on scales of the observed\nundulations, suggesting that the filament's transverse waves are magnetically\ninduced. Because the magnetic fields are subcritical on scales of the filament\non larger scales, the system as a whole is relatively stable and long lived.\nProtostellar ejection occurs because the gas accelerates away from the\nprotostars, not the other way around. The model also implies that the ISF is\nkinematically young, which is consistent with other lines of evidence. The\nsouthern filament has a broken power law, which matches the ISF profile for\n2.5<b/pc<8.5, but is shallower closer in. It is also kinematically older than\nthe ISF.\n", "  Our earlier paper \"Complexity Equals Action\" conjectured that the quantum\ncomputational complexity of a holographic state is given by the classical\naction of a region in the bulk (the \"Wheeler-DeWitt\" patch). We provide\ncalculations for the results quoted in that paper, explain how it fits into a\nbroader (tensor) network of ideas, and elaborate on the hypothesis that black\nholes are the fastest computers in nature.\n", "  The integrations leading to the Cachazo-He-Yuan (CHY) double-color $n$-point\nmassless scalar amplitude are carried out one integral at a time. M\\\"obius\ninvariance dictates the final amplitude to be independent of the three M\\\"obius\nconstants $\\sigma_r, \\sigma_s, \\sigma_t$, but their choice affects integrations\nand the intermediate results. The effect of the M\\\"obius constants, the two\ncolors, and the scattering functions on each integration is investigated. A\nsystematic way to carry out the $n-3$ integrations is explained, each exposing\none of the $n-3$ propagators of the Feynman diagrams. Two detailed examples are\nshown to illustrate the procedure, one a five-point amplitude, and the other a\nnine-point amplitude.\n", "  I present the results from the recent PDF4LHC study, and the resulting new\nrecommendation for combining PDFs sets for LHC calculations. In order to put\nthis into context I summarise continuing updates in PDFs. This includes\nimprovements and recent updates of particular PDF sets due to theory\nimprovements and a variety of new data sets, including most of the up-to-date\nLHC data. I will emphasise particular issues relevant for top physics.\n", "  Compton scattering of polarized radiation in a strong magnetic field is\nconsidered. The recipe for calculation of the scattering matrix elements, the\ndifferential and total cross sections based on quantum electrodynamic (QED)\nsecond order perturbation theory is presented for the case of arbitrary initial\nand final Landau level, electron momentum along the field and photon momentum.\nPhoton polarization and electron spin state are taken into account. The correct\ndependence of natural Landau level width on the electron spin state is taken\ninto account in general case of arbitrary initial photon momentum for the first\ntime. A number of steps in calculations were simplified analytically making the\npresented recipe easy-to-use. The redistribution functions over the photon\nenergy, momentum and polarization states are presented and discussed. The paper\ngeneralizes already known results and offers a basis for accurate calculation\nof radiation transfer in strong $B$-field, for example, in strongly magnetized\nneutron stars.\n", "  We discuss thermal rectification and thermoelectric energy conversion from\nthe perspective of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics and dynamical systems\ntheory. After preliminary considerations on the dynamical foundations of the\nphenomenological Fourier law in classical and quantum mechanics, we illustrate\nways to control the phononic heat flow and design thermal diodes. Finally, we\nconsider the coupled transport of heat and charge and discuss several general\nmechanisms for optimizing the figure of merit of thermoelectric efficiency.\n", "  We study the holographic superconductor-normal metal-superconductor (SNS)\nJosephon junction in the massive gravity. In the homogeneous case of the\nchemical potential, we find that the graviton mass will make the normal\nmetal-superconductor phase transition harder to take place. In the holographic\nmodel of Josephson junction, it is found that the maximal tunneling current\nwill decrease according to the graviton mass. Besides, the coherence length of\nthe junction decreases as well with respect to the graviton mass. If one\ninterprets the graviton mass as the effect of momentum dissipation in the\nboundary field theory, it indicates that the stronger the momentum dissipation\nis, the smaller the coherence length is.\n", "  When current flows through a magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ), there is spin\naccumulation at the electrode-barrier interfaces if the magnetic moments of the\ntwo ferromagnetic electrodes are not aligned. Here we report that such\nnonequilibrium spin accumulation generates its own characteristic low frequency\nnoise (LFN). Past work viewed the LFN in MTJs as an equilibrium effect arising\nfrom resistance fluctuations ($S_R$) which a passively applied current ($I$)\nconverts to measurable voltage fluctuations ($S_{V}=I^{2}S_{R}$). We treat the\nLFN associated with spin accumulation as a nonequilibrium effect, and find that\nthe noise power can be fitted in terms of the spin-polarized current by\n$S_{I}f=aI\\coth(\\frac{I}{b})-ab$, resembling the form of the shot noise for a\ntunnel junction, but with current now taking the role of the bias voltage, and\nspin-flip probability taking the role of tunneling probability.\n", "  We experimentally and theoretically investigated the deprotonation process on\nnanosecond to microsecond timescale in ethylene and acetylene molecules,\nfollowing their double ionization by a strong femtosecond laser field. In our\nexperiments we utilized coincidence detection with the reaction microscope\ntechnique, and found that both the lifetime of the long-lived ethylene dication\nleading to the delayed deprotonation and the relative channel strength of the\ndelayed deprotonation compared to the prompt one have no evident dependence on\nthe laser pulse duration and the laser peak intensity. Quantum chemical\nsimulations suggest that such delayed fragmentation originates from the\ntunneling of near-dissociation-threshold vibrational states through a\ndissociation barrier on a dication electronic state along C--H stretching. Such\nvibrational states can be populated through strong field double ionization\ninduced vibrational excitation on an electronically excited state in the case\nof ethylene, and through intersystem crossing from electronically excited\nstates to the electronic ground state in the case of acetylene.\n", "  The spin Hall angle (SHA) is a measure of the efficiency with which a\ntransverse spin current is generated from a charge current by the spin-orbit\ncoupling and disorder in the spin Hall effect (SHE). In a study of the SHE for\na Pt$|$Py (Py=Ni$_{80}$Fe$_{20}$) bilayer using a first-principles scattering\napproach, we find a SHA that increases monotonically with temperature and is\nproportional to the resistivity for bulk Pt. By decomposing the room\ntemperature SHE and inverse SHE currents into bulk and interface terms, we\ndiscover a giant interface SHA that dominates the total inverse SHE current\nwith potentially major consequences for applications.\n", "  We study thermoelectric transport through a coherent molecular conductor\nconnected to two electron and two phonon baths using the nonequilibrium Green's\nfunction method. We focus on the mutual drag between electron and phonon\ntransport as a result of `momentum' transfer, which happens only when there are\nat least two phonon degrees of freedom. After deriving expressions for the\nlinear drag coefficients, obeying the Onsager relation, we further investigate\ntheir effect on nonequilibrium transport. We show that the drag effect is\nclosely related to two other phenomena: (1) adiabatic charge pumping through a\ncoherent conductor; (2) the current-induced nonconservative and effective\nmagnetic forces on phonons.\n", "  By measuring magnetoresistance and Hall effect in classically moderate\nperpendicular magnetic field in Si-MOSFET-type macroscopic antidot array we\nfound a novel effect: nonlinear with field, temperature- and density-dependent\nHall resistivity. We discuss qualitative explanation of the phenomenon and\nsuggest that it might originate from strong temperature dependence of the\nresistivity and mobility in the shells of the antidots.\n", "  We present an experimental study on the interaction and dynamics of\nhalf-quantum vortices (HQVs) in an antiferromagnetic spinor Bose-Einstein\ncondensate. By exploiting the orbit motion of a vortex dipole in a trapped\ncondensate, we perform a collision experiment of two HQV pairs, and observe\nthat the scattering motions of the HQVs is consistent with the short-range\nvortex interaction that arises from nonsingular magnetized vortex cores. We\nalso investigate the relaxation dynamics of turbulent condensates containing\nmany HQVs, and demonstrate that spin wave excitations are generated by the\ncollisional motions of the HQVs. The short-range vortex interaction and the\nHQV-magnon coupling represent two characteristics of the HQV dynamics in the\nspinor superfluid.\n", "  We theoretically investigate the behavior of a moving impurity immersed in a\nsea of fermionic atoms that are confined in a quasi-periodic (bichromatic)\noptical lattice, within a standard variational approach. We consider both\nrepulsive and attractive contact interactions for such a simplest many-body\nlocalization problem of Fermi polarons. The variational approach enables us to\naccess relatively large systems and therefore may be used to understand\nmany-body localization in the thermodynamic limit. The energy and wave-function\nof the polaron states are found to be strongly affected by the quasi-random\nlattice potential and their experimental measurements (i.e., via\nradio-frequency spectroscopy or quantum gas microscope) therefore provide a\nsensitive way to underpin the localization transition. We determine a phase\ndiagram by calculating two critical quasi-random disorder strengths, which\ncorrespond to the onset of the localization of the ground-state polaron state\nand the many-body localization of all polaron states, respectively. Our\npredicted phase diagram could be straightforwardly examined in current\ncold-atom experiments.\n", "  We calculate the spectrum of transfer matrix eigenvalues associated with\nPolyakov loops in finite-density lattice QCD with static quarks. These\neigenvalues determine the spatial behavior of Polyakov loop correlations\nfunctions. Our results are valid for all values of the gauge coupling in $1+1$\ndimensions, and valid in the strong-coupling region for any number of\ndimensions. When the quark chemical potential $\\mu$ is nonzero, the spatial\ntransfer matrix $T_s$ is non-Hermitian. The appearance of complex eigenvalues\nin $T_s$ is a manifestation of the sign problem in finite-density QCD. The\ninvariance of finite-density QCD under the combined action of charge\nconjugation $\\mathcal{C}$ and complex conjugation $\\mathcal{K}$ implies that\nthe eigenvalues of $T_s$ are either real or part of a complex pair. Calculation\nof the spectrum confirms the existence of complex pairs in much of the\ntemperature-chemical potential plane. Many features of the spectrum for static\nquarks are determined by a particle-hole symmetry. For $\\mu$ small compared to\nthe quark mass $M$, we typically find real eigenvalues for the lowest lying\nstates. At somewhat larger values of $\\mu,$ pairs of eigenvalues may form\ncomplex-conjugate pairs, leading to damped oscillatory behavior in Polyakov\nloop correlation functions. However, near $\\mu=M$, the low-lying spectrum\nbecomes real again. This is a direct consequence of the approximate\nparticle-hole symmetry at $\\mu=M$ for heavy quarks. This behavior of the\neigenvalues should be observable in lattice simulations and can be used as a\ntest of lattice algorithms. Our results provide independent confirmation of\nresults we have previously obtained in PNJL models using complex saddle points.\n", "  We study the behavior of a topological Josephson junction in which two\ntopological superconductors are coupled through a quantum dot. We focus on the\ncase with the bulk superconducting gap being the largest energy scale. Two\nparameter regimes are investigated: a weak tunneling between the dot and the\nsuperconductors, with the dot near its charge degeneracy point, and a strong\ntunneling regime in which the transmission between the dot and the\nsuperconductors is nearly perfect. We show that in the former situation, the\nAndreev spectrum for each sector with fixed fermion parity consists of only two\nlevels, which gives rise to the nontrivial current-phase relation. Moreover, we\nstudy the Rabi oscillation between the two levels and indicates that the\ncorresponding frequency is a $4\\pi$-periodic function of the phase difference\nbetween the two superconductors, which is immune to the quasiparticle\npoisoning. In the latter case, we find that the Coulomb charging energy\nenhances the effect of backscattering at the interfaces between the dot and the\nsuperconductors. Both the temperature and the gate-voltage dependence of the\ncritical Josephson current are examined.\n", "  Gauge mediation predicts 10 TeV or heavier squarks because such a heavy stop\nis required to explain the observed 125 GeV Higgs boson mass without a large\ntrilinear soft mass term in the minimal supersymmetric standard model. Although\nsuch a high scale cannot be searched by the LHC directly, gauge mediation also\npredicts a hierarchy $\\mu^2 \\ll B_\\mu$ by a simple and naive solution of the\n$\\mu$ problem. We point out that this simple and naive way of generating the\n$\\mu$ ($B_\\mu$) term works in the case of 10 TeV or heavier squarks with a\nslight breaking of a GUT relation among messenger B-terms (or supersymmetric\nmass terms). Furthermore, the upper bound on the Higgsino mass is obtained from\nthe observed Higgs boson mass, perturbativity of a relevant coupling, and\nconditions avoiding tachyonic sneutrinos and stop. It turns out that the light\nHiggsino of O(100) GeV is a promising signal of gauge mediation.\n", "  We study theoretically Coulomb drag in capacitively coupled quantum dots\n(CQDs) -- a biasdriven dot coupled to an unbiased dot where transport is due to\nCoulomb mediated energy transfer drag. To this end, we introduce a\nmaster-equation approach which accounts for higher-order tunneling\n(cotunneling) processes as well as energy-dependent lead couplings, and\nidentify a mesoscopic Coulomb drag mechanism driven by nonlocal multi-electron\ncotunneling processes. Our theory establishes the conditions for a nonzero drag\nas well as the direction of the drag current in terms of microscopic system\nparameters. Interestingly, the direction of the drag current is not determined\nby the drive current, but by an interplay between the energy-dependent lead\ncouplings. Studying the drag mechanism in a graphene-based CQD heterostructure,\nwe show that the predictions of our theory are consistent with recent\nexperiments on Coulomb drag in CQD systems.\n", "  The recent experimental realization of Bose-Fermi superfluid mixtures of\ndilute ultracold atomic gases has opened new perspectives in the study of\nquantum many-body systems. Depending on the values of the scattering lengths\nand the amount of bosons and fermions, a uniform Bose-Fermi mixture is\npredicted to exhibit a fully mixed phase, a fully separated phase or, in\naddition, a purely fermionic phase coexisting with a mixed phase. The\noccurrence of this intermediate configuration has interesting consequences when\nthe system is nonuniform. In this work we theoretically investigate the case of\nsolitonic solutions of coupled Bogoliubov-de Gennes and Gross-Pitaevskii\nequations for the fermionic and bosonic components, respectively. We show that,\nin the partially separated phase, a dark soliton in Fermi superfluid is\naccompanied by a broad bosonic component in the soliton, forming a dark-bright\nsoliton which keeps full spatial coherence.\n", "  Multiscale plasmonic systems e.g. extended metallic nanostructures with\nsub-nanometer inter-distances) play a key role in the development of\nnext-generation nano-photonic devices.\n  An accurate modeling of the optical interactions in these systems requires an\naccurate description of both quantum effects and far-field properties.\n  Classical electromagnetism can only describe the latter, while Time-Dependent\nDensity Functional Theory (TD-DFT) can provide a full first-principles quantum\ntreatment.\n  However, TD-DFT becomes computationally prohibitive for sizes that exceed few\nnanometers, which are irrelevant for practical applications. In this article,\nwe introduce a method based on the quantum hydrodynamic theory (QHT), which\nincludes non-local contributions of the kinetic energy and the correct\nasymptotic description of the electron density.\n  We show that our QHT method can predict both plasmon energy and spill-out\neffects in metal nanoparticles in excellent agreement with TD-DFT predictions,\nthus allowing a reliable and efficient calculations of both quantum and\nfar-field properties in multiscale plasmonic systems.\n", "  We use a suite of cosmological simulations to study the\nmass-concentration-redshift relation, $c({\\rm M},z)$, of dark matter halos. Our\nsimulations include standard $\\Lambda$-cold dark matter (CDM) models, and\nadditional runs with truncated power spectra, consistent with a thermal warm\ndark matter (WDM) scenario. We find that the mass profiles of CDM and WDM halos\nare self-similar and well approximated by the Einasto profile. The $c({\\rm\nM},z)$ relation of CDM halos is monotonic: concentrations decrease with\nincreasing virial mass at fixed redshift, and decrease with increasing redshift\nat fixed mass. The mass accretion histories (MAHs) of CDM halos are also\nscale-free, and can be used to infer concentrations directly. These results do\nnot apply to WDM halos: their MAHs are not scale-free because of the\ncharacteristic scale imposed by the power-spectrum suppression. Further, the\nWDM $c({\\rm M},z)$ relation is non-monotonic: concentrations peak at a mass\nscale dictated by the truncation scale, and decrease at higher and lower\nmasses. We show that the assembly history of a halo can still be used to infer\nits concentration, provided that the total mass of its progenitors is\nconsidered (the \"collapsed mass history\"; CMH), rather than just that of its\nmain ancestor. This exploits the scale-free nature of CMHs to derive a simple\nscaling that reproduces the mass-concentration-redshift relation of both CDM\nand WDM halos over a vast range of halo masses and redshifts. Our model\ntherefore provides a robust account of the mass, redshift, cosmology and power\nspectrum dependence of dark matter halo concentrations.\n", "  Determination of energy transport is crucial for understanding the energy\nbudget and fluid circulation in density varying fluids such as the ocean and\nthe atmosphere. However, it is rarely possible to determine the energy flux\nfield $\\mathbf{J} = p \\mathbf{u}$, which requires simultaneous measurements of\nthe pressure and velocity perturbation fields, $p$ and $\\mathbf{u}$. We present\na method for obtaining the instantaneous $\\mathbf{J}(x,z,t)$ from density\nperturbations alone: a Green's function-based calculation yields $p$, and\n$\\mathbf{u}$ is obtained by integrating the continuity equation and the\nincompressibility condition. We validate our method with results from\nNavier-Stokes simulations: the Green's function method is applied to the\ndensity perturbation field from the simulations, and the result for\n$\\mathbf{J}$ is found to agree typically to within $1\\%$ with $\\mathbf{J}$\ncomputed directly using $p$ and $ \\mathbf{u}$ from the Navier-Stokes\nsimulation. We also apply the Green's function method to density perturbation\ndata from laboratory schlieren measurements of internal waves in a stratified\nfluid, and the result for $\\mathbf{J}$ agrees to within $6\\%$ with results from\nNavier-Stokes simulations. Our method for determining the instantaneous\nvelocity, pressure, and energy flux fields applies to any system described by a\nlinear approximation of the density perturbation field, e.g., to small\namplitude lee waves and propagating vertical modes. The method can be applied\nusing our Matlab graphical user interface EnergyFlux.\n", "  We propose to increase the fidelity of two-qubit resonator-induced phase\ngates in circuit QED by the use of narrowband single-mode squeezed drive. We\nshow that there exists an optimal squeezing angle and strength that erases\nqubit 'which-path' information leaking out of the cavity and thereby minimizes\nqubit dephasing during these gates. Our analytical results for the gate\nfidelity are in excellent agreement with numerical simulations of a cascaded\nmaster equation that takes into account the dynamics of the source of squeezed\nradiation. With realistic parameters, we find that it is possible to realize a\ncontrolled-phase gate with a gate time of 200 ns and average infidelity of\n$10^{-5}$.\n", "  We investigate the effect of including the HERA run I + II combined cross\nsection data on the MMHT2014 PDFs. We present the fit quality within the\ncontext of the global fit and when only the HERA data are included. We examine\nthe changes in both the central values and uncertainties in the PDFs. We find\nthat the prediction for the data is good, and only relatively small\nimprovements in $\\chi^2$ and changes in the PDFs are obtained with a refit at\nboth NLO and NNLO. PDF uncertainties are slightly reduced. There is a small\ndependence of the fit quality on the value of $Q^2_{\\min}$. This can be\nimproved by phenomenologically motived corrections to $F_L(x,Q^2)$ which\nparametrically are largely in the form of higher-twist type contributions.\n", "  We study the protection of subradiant states by the symmetry of the atomic\ndistributions in the Dicke limit, in which collective Lamb shifts cannot be\nneglected. We find that anti-symmetric states are subradiant states for\ndistributions with reflection symmetry. Continuous symmetry can also be used to\nachieve subradiance. This study is relevant to the problem of robust quantum\nmemory with long storage time and fast readout.\n", "  Photon impingement is capable of liberating electrons in electronic devices\nand driving the electron flux from the lower chemical potential to higher\nchemical potential. Previous studies hinted that the thermodynamic efficiency\nof a nano-sized photoelectric converter at maximum power is bounded by the\nCurzon-Ahlborn efficiency. In this study, we apply quantum effects to design a\nphotoelectric converter based on a three-level quantum dot (QD) interacting\nwith fermionic baths and photons. We show that, by adopting a pair of suitable\ndegenerate states, quantum coherences induced by the couplings of quantum dots\n(QDs) to sunlight and fermion baths can coexist steadily in nano-electronic\nsystems. Our analysis indicates that the efficiency at maximum power is no more\nlimited to Curzon-Ahlborn efficiency through manipulation of carefully\ncontrolled quantum coherences.\n", "  In this paper we present a model of subcritical hybrid inflation with a\nPati-Salam [PS] symmetry group. Both the inflaton and waterfall fields\ncontribute to the necessary e-foldings of inflation, while only the waterfall\nfield spontaneously breaks PS hence monopoles produced during inflation are\ndiluted during the inflationary epoch. The model is able to produce a\ntensor-to-scalar ratio, $r < 0.09$ consistent with the latest BICEP2/Keck and\nPlanck data, as well as scalar density perturbations and spectral index, $n_s$,\nconsistent with Planck data. For particular values of the parameters, we find\n$r = 0.084$ and $n_s = 0.0963$. The energy density during inflation is directly\nrelated to the PS breaking scale, $v_{PS}$. The model also incorporates a\n$\\mathbb{Z}_4^R$ symmetry which can resolve the $\\mu$ problem and suppress\ndimension 5 operators for proton decay, leaving over an exact $R$-parity.\nFinally the model allows for a complete three family extension with a $D_4$\nfamily symmetry which reproduces low energy precision electroweak and LHC data.\n", "  A charged entanglement entropy is a new measure which probes quantum\nentanglement between different charge sectors. We study symmetry protected\ntopological (SPT) phases in 2+1 dimensional space-time by using this charged\nentanglement entropy. SPT phases are short range entangled states without\ntopological order and hence cannot be detected by the topological entanglement\nentropy. We demonstrate that the universal part of the charged entanglement\nentropy is non-zero for non-trivial SPT phases and therefore it is a useful\nmeasure to detect short range entangled topological phases. We also discuss\nthat the classification of SPT phases based on the charged topological\nentanglement entropy is related to that of the braiding statistics of\nquasiparticles.\n", "  We introduce a variant of continuous random cascade models that extends\nformer constructions introduced by Barral-Mandelbrot and Bacry-Muzy in the\nsense that they can be supported by sets of arbitrary fractal dimension. The so\nintroduced sets are exactly self-similar stationary versions of random Cantor\nsets formerly introduced by Mandelbrot as \"random cutouts\". We discuss the main\nmathematical properties of our construction and compute its scaling properties.\nWe then illustrate our purpose on several numerical examples and we consider a\npossible application to rainfall data. We notably show that our model allows us\nto reproduce remarkably the distribution of dry period durations.\n", "  We consider a relativistic plasma of fermions coupled to an Abelian gauge\nfield and carrying a chiral charge asymmetry, which might arise in the early\nUniverse through baryogenesis. It is known that on large length scales,\n$\\lambda \\gtrsim 1/(\\alpha \\mu_5)$, the chiral anomaly opens an instability\ntoward the erasure of chiral charge and growth of magnetic helicity. Here the\nchemical potential $\\mu_{5}$ parametrizes the chiral asymmetry and $\\alpha$ is\nthe fine-structure constant. We study the process of chiral charge erasure\nthrough the thermal fluctuations of magnetic helicity and contrast with the\nwell-studied phenomenon of Chern-Simons number diffusion. Through the\nfluctuation-dissipation theorem we estimate the amplitude and time scale of\nhelicity fluctuations on the length scale $\\lambda$, finding $\\delta\n\\mathcal{H} \\sim \\lambda T$ and $\\tau \\sim \\alpha \\lambda^3 T^2$ for a\nrelativistic plasma at temperature $T$. We argue that the presence of a chiral\nasymmetry allows the helicity to grow diffusively for a time $t \\sim\nT^3/(\\alpha^5 \\mu_5^4)$ until it reaches an equilibrium value $\\mathcal{H} \\sim\n\\mu_{5} T^2 / \\alpha$, and the chiral asymmetry is partially erased. If the\nchiral asymmetry is small, $\\mu_5 < T/\\alpha$, this avenue for chiral charge\nerasure is found to be slower than the chiral magnetic effect for which $t \\sim\nT / (\\alpha^3 \\mu_{5}^2)$. This mechanism for chiral charge erasure can be\nimportant for the hypercharge sector of the Standard Model as well as\nextensions including ${\\rm U}(1)$ gauge interactions, such as asymmetric dark\nmatter models.\n", "  We discuss the next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) QCD corrections to Z\nboson production in association with a jet including all partonic channels at\nall color levels and including the leptonic decay of the Z boson. We focus on\nthe optimization of the numerical evaluation of the double-real contribution\nand demonstrate that our procedure for spreading the Monte Carlo integration\nover $\\mathcal{O}(1000)$ cores and recombining the results afterwards lead to\nstable results with sensible error estimates. We apply representative cuts on\nthe jet and charged lepton transverse momenta and pseudorapidities at LHC\nenergies and present the transverse momentum and rapidity distributions of the\ncharged leptons.\n", "  Investigations of the elastic behavior of bulk elastomers have traditionally\nproceeded on the basis of classical rubber elasticity, which regards chains as\nthermally fluctuating but disregards the thermal fluctuations of the\ncross-links. Here, we consider an incompressible and flat elastomer film of an\naxisymmetric shape confined between two large hard co-planar substrates, with\nthe axis of the film perpendicular to the substrates. We address the impact\nthat thermal fluctuations of the cross-links have on the free energy of elastic\ndeformation of the system, subject to the requirement that the fluctuating\nelastomer cannot detach from the substrates. We examine the behavior of the\ndeformation free energy for one case where a rigid pinning boundary condition\nis applied to a class of elastic fluctuations at the confining surfaces, and\nanother case where the same elastic fluctuations are subjected to soft \"gluing\"\npotentials. We find that there can be significant departures (both quantitative\nand qualitative) from the prediction of classical rubber elasticity theory when\nelastic fluctuations are included. Finally, we compare the character of the\nattractive part of the elastic fluctuation-induced, or pseudo-Casimir, stress\nwith the standard thermal Casimir stress in confined but non-elastomeric\nsystems, finding the same power law decay behavior when a rigid pinning\nboundary condition is applied, for the case of the gluing potential, we find\nthat the leading order correction to the attractive part of the fluctuation\nstress decays inversely with the inter-substrate separation.\n", "  It is shown that the deformed Seiberg-Witten curve equation after Fourier\ntransform is mapped into a differential equation for the AGT dual 2d CFT\ncnformal block containing an extra completely degenerate field. We carefully\nmatch parameters in two sides of duality thus providing not only a simple\nindependent prove of the AGT correspondence in Nekrasov-Shatashvili limit, but\nalso an extension of AGT to the case when a secondary field is included in the\nCFT conformal block. Implications of our results in the study of monodromy\nproblems for a large class of $n$'th order Fuchsian differential equations are\ndiscussed.\n", "  We address electron spin resonance of single magnetic moments in a tunnel\njunction using time-dependent electric fields and spin-polarized current. We\nshow that the tunneling current directly depends on the local magnetic moment\nand that the frequency of the external electric field mixes with the\ncharacteristic Larmor frequency of the local spin. The importance of the\nspin-polarized current induced anisotropy fields acting on the local spin\nmoment is, moreover, demonstrated. Our proposed model thus explains the absence\nof an electron spin resonance for a half integer spin, in contrast with the\nstrong signal observed for an integer spin.\n", "  We argue that a hidden-charm pentaquark recently observed in weak decays of\n$\\Lambda_{b}$ can be produced in proton-nucleus collisions without electroweak\nintermediaries. We analyze the production cross-section for several scenarios\nof internal structure and find that a cross-section is sizable. This process\ncan be studied both in collider as well as in fixed-target experiments. In the\nformer case, the pentaquarks are produced at very forward rapidities, whereas\nin the latter case, pentaquarks are produced with relatively small rapidities\nand can be easily detected via invariant mass distribution of a forward\n$J/\\psi$ and a comoving proton. Additionally, the suggested process allows to\ncheck the existence of a neutral pentaquark $P_{c}^{0}$ (an isospin partner of\n$P_{c}^{+}$) predicted in several models. The rapidity and transverse momentum\ndistributions of pentaquarks could provide comprehensive information about the\n$\\bar{c}c$ component of this exotic baryon.\n", "  We report on the first micro-scale observation of the velocity field imposed\nby a non-uniform heat content along the solid/liquid boundary. We determine\nboth radial and vertical velocity components of this thermo-osmotic flow field\nby tracking single tracer nanoparticles. The measured flow profiles are\ncompared to an approximate analytical theory and to numerical calculations.\nFrom the measured slip velocity we deduce the thermo-osmotic coefficient for\nboth bare glass and Pluronic F-127 covered surfaces. The value for Pluronic\nF-127 agrees well with Soret data for polyethylene glycol, whereas that for\nglass differs from literature values and indicates the complex boundary layer\nthermodynamics of glass-water interfaces.\n", "  As a minimal mathematical model generating cascade analogous to that of the\nNavier-Stokes turbulence in the inertial range, we propose a one-dimensional\npartial-differential-equation model that conserves the integral of the squared\nvorticity analogue (enstrophy) in the inviscid case. With a large-scale forcing\nand small viscosity, we find numerically that the model exhibits the enstrophy\ncascade, the broad energy spectrum with a sizable correction to the\ndimensional-analysis prediction, peculiar intermittency and self-similarity in\nthe dynamical system structure.\n", "  Active colloids are microscopic particles, which self-propel through viscous\nfluids by converting energy extracted from their environment into directed\nmotion. We first explain how articial microswimmers move forward by generating\nnear-surface flow fields via self-phoresis or the self-induced Marangoni\neffect. We then discuss generic features of the dynamics of single active\ncolloids in bulk and in confinement, as well as in the presence of gravity,\nfield gradients, and fluid flow. In the third part, we review the emergent\ncollective behavior of active colloidal suspensions focussing on their\nstructural and dynamic properties. After summarizing experimental observations,\nwe give an overview on the progress in modeling collectively moving active\ncolloids. While active Brownian particles are heavily used to study collective\ndynamics on large scales, more advanced methods are necessary to explore the\nimportance of hydrodynamic and phoretic particle interactions. Finally, the\nrelevant physical approaches to quantify the emergent collective behavior are\npresented.\n", "  Two-dimensional (2D) topological insulators (TIs) with a large bulk band-gap\nare promising for experimental studies of the quantum spin Hall effect and for\nspintronic device applications. Despite considerable theoretical efforts in\npredicting large-gap 2D TI candidates, only few of them have been\nexperimentally verified. Here, by combining scanning tunneling\nmicroscopy/spectroscopy and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we\nreveal that the top monolayer of ZrTe5 crystals hosts a large band gap of ~100\nmeV on the surface and a finite constant density-of-states within the gap at\nthe step edge. Our first-principles calculations confirm the topologically\nnontrivial nature of the edge states. These results demonstrate that the top\nmonolayer of ZrTe5 crystals is a large-gap 2D TI suitable for topotronic\napplications at high temperature.\n", "  Long carrier spin lifetimes are a double-edged sword for the prospect of\nconstructing \"spintronic\" logic devices: Preservation of the logic variable\nwithin the transport channel or interconnect is essential to successful\ncompletion of the logic operation, but any spins remaining past this event will\npollute the environment for subsequent clock cycles. Electric fields can be\nused to manipulate these spins on a fast timescale by careful interplay of\nspin-orbit effects, but efficient controlled depolarization can only be\ncompletely achieved with amenable materials properties. Taking III-VI\nmonochalcogenide monolayers as an example 2D semiconductor, we use symmetry\nanalysis, perturbation theory, and ensemble calculation to show how this\nlongstanding problem can be solved by suitable manipulation of conduction\nelectrons.\n", "  We construct the free field representation of irregular vertex operators of\narbitrary rank which generates simultaneous eigenstates of positive modes of\nVirasoro and\n  W symmetry generators. The irregular vertex operators turn out to be the\nexponentials of combinations of derivatives of Liouville or Toda fields,\ncreating irregular coherent states. We compute examples of correlation\nfunctions of these operators and study their operator algebra.\n", "  Gravitational Microlensing has been used as a powerful tool for astrophysical\nstudies and exoplanet detections. In the gravitational microlensing, we have\ntwo images with negative and positive parities. The negative-parity image is a\nfainter image and is produced at a closer angular separation with respect to\nthe lens star. In the case of a red-giant lens star and large impact parameter\nof lensing, this image can be eclipsed by the lens star. The result would be\ndimming the flux receiving from the combination of the source and the lens\nstars and the light curve resembles to an eclipsing binary system. In this\nwork, we introduce this phenomenon and propose an observational procedure for\ndetecting this eclipse. The follow-up microlensing telescopes with lucky\nimaging camera or space-based telescopes can produce high resolution images\nfrom the events with reddish sources and confirm the possibility of blending\ndue to the lens star. After conforming a red-giant lens star and source star,\nwe can use the advance photometric methods and detect the relative flux change\nduring the eclipse in the order of $10^{-4}-10^{-3}$. Observation of the\neclipse provides the angular size of source star in the unit of Einstein angle\nand combination of this observation with the parallax observation enable us to\ncalculate the mass of lens star. Finally, we analyzed seven microlensing event\nand show the feasibility of observation of this effect in future observations.\n", "  Recently it was established in Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton gravity that the KSS\nviscosity/entropy ratio associated with AdS planar black holes can be viewed as\nthe boundary dual to the generalized Smarr relation of the black holes in the\nbulk. In this paper we establish this relation in Einstein gravity with general\nminimally-coupled matter, and also in theories with an additional non-minimally\ncoupled scalar field. We consider two examples for explicit demonstrations.\n", "  The long term evolution of ULX with their spectral and luminosity variations\nin time give important clues on the nature of ULX and on the accretion process\nthat powers them. We report here the results of a Swift-XRT 6-year monitoring\ncampaign of the closest example of a persistent ULX, M33 X-8, that extends to\n16 years the monitoring of this source in the soft X-rays. The luminosity of\nthis source is a few 10^39 erg/s, marking the faint end of the ULX luminosity\nfunction. We analysed the set of 15 observations collected during the Swift\nmonitoring. We searched for differences in the spectral parameters at different\nobserving epochs, adopting several models commonly used to fit the X-ray\nspectra of ULX. The source exhibits flux variations of the order of 30%. No\nsignificant spectral variations are observed along the monitoring. The average\n0.5-10 keV spectrum can be well described by a thermal model, either in the\nform of a slim disk, or as a combination of a Comptonized corona and a standard\naccretion disk.\n", "  RM CLEAN is a standard method to reconstruct the distribution of cosmic\nmagnetic fields and polarized sources along the line of sight (LOS) from\nobserved polarization spectrum. This method is similar to the CLEAN algorithm\nfor aperture synthesis radio telescope images but it is rather unclear in what\ncases RM CLEAN works well. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of RM\nCLEAN by simulating spectro-polarimetric observations of two compact sources\nlocated in the same LOS, varying the relative initial polarization angle and\nFaraday depth systematically. Especially, we focus on if the two polarized\nsources can be resolved in the Faraday depth space and how well the source\nparameters can be estimated. We confirm the previous studies that two sources\ncannot be resolved when they are closely located in the Faraday depth space for\nspecific values of the relative initial polarization angle. Further, we\ncalculate the chi-square value for the fit between the mock data of\npolarization spectrum and the one from RM CLEAN. Then we find that the\nchi-squared value is not always significantly large even when RM CLEAN gives\nwrong results.\n", "  Extracting the unique information on ultradense nuclear matter from the\ngravitational waves emitted by merging, neutron-star binaries requires robust\ntheoretical models of the signal. We develop a novel effective-one-body\nwaveform model that includes, for the first time, dynamic (instead of only\nadiabatic) tides of the neutron star, as well as the merger signal for\nneutron-star--black-hole binaries. We demonstrate the importance of the dynamic\ntides by comparing our model against new numerical-relativity simulations of\nnonspinning neutron-star--black-hole binaries spanning more than 24\ngravitational-wave cycles, and to other existing numerical simulations for\ndouble neutron-star systems. Furthermore, we derive an effective description\nthat makes explicit the dependence of matter effects on two key parameters:\ntidal deformability and fundamental oscillation frequency.\n", "  We present the first X-ray observations of three recently discovered\nmillisecond pulsars (MSPs) with interesting characteristics: PSR J0337+1715,\nPSR J0636+5129, and PSR J0645+5158. PSR J0337+1715 is a fast-spinning, bright,\nand so-far unique MSP in a hierarchical triple system with two white dwarf (WD)\ncompanions. PSR J0636+5129 is a MSP in a very tight 96-min orbit with a\nlow-mass, 8 $M_J$ companion. PSR J0645+5158 is a nearby, isolated MSP with a\nvery small duty cycle (1-2%), which has led to its inclusion in high-precision\npulsar timing programs. Using data from XMM-Newton, we have analyzed X-ray\nspectroscopy for these three objects, as well as optical/ultraviolet photometry\nfor PSR J0337+1715. The X-ray data for each are largely consistent with\nexpectations for most MSPs with regards to the ratios of thermal and\nnon-thermal emission. We discuss the implications of these data on the pulsar\npopulation, and prospects for future observations of these pulsars.\n", "  Using non-equilibrium Green's functions, we studied numerically the transport\nproperties of a Josephson junction, superconductor-topological\ninsulator-superconductor hybrid system. Our numerical calculation shows first\nthat proximity-induced superconductivity is indeed observed in the edge states\nof a topological insulator adjoining two superconducting leads and second that\nthe special characteristics of topological insulators endow the edge states\nwith an enhanced proximity effect with a superconductor but do not forbid the\nbulk states to do the same. In a size-dependent analysis of the local current,\nit was found that a few residual bulk states can lead to measurable resistance,\nwhereas because these bulk states spread over the whole sample, their\ncontribution to the interference pattern is insignificant when the sample size\nis in the micrometer range. Based on these numerical results, it is concluded\nthat the apparent disappearance of residual bulk states in the superconducting\ninterference process as described in Ref. [\\onlinecite{HartNautrePhys2014f}] is\njust due to the effects of size: the contribution of the topological edge\nstates outweighs that of the residual bulk states.\n", "  Employing the $\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{p}$ expansion for a family of\ntight-binding models for SmB$_6$, we analytically compute topological surface\nstates on a generic $(lmn)$ surface. We show how the Dirac-cone spin structure\ndepends on model ingredients and on the angle $\\theta$ between the surface\nnormal and the main crystal axes. We apply the general theory to $(001)$,\n$(110)$, $(111)$, and $(210)$ surfaces, for which we provide concrete\npredictions for the spin pattern of surface states which we also compare with\ntight-binding results. As shown in previous work, the spin pattern on a $(001)$\nsurface can be related to the value of mirror Chern numbers, and we explore the\npossibility of topological phase transitions between states with different\nmirror Chern numbers and the associated change of the spin structure of surface\nstates. Such transitions may be accessed by varying either the hybridization\nterm in the Hamiltonian or the crystal-field splitting of the low-energy $f$\nmultiplets, and we compute corresponding phase diagrams.\n", "  Quantum kinetic equations of motion for carrier and impurity spins in\nparamagnetic II-VI diluted magnetic semiconductors in a $\\mathbf{k}$-dependent\neffective magnetic field are derived, where the carrier-impurity correlations\nare taken into account. In the Markov limit, rates for the electron-impurity\nspin transfer can be derived for electron spins parallel and perpendicular to\nthe impurity spins corresponding to measurable decay rates in Kerr experiments\nin Faraday and Voigt geometry. Our rigorous microscopic quantum kinetic\ntreatment automatically accounts for the fact that, in an individual spin\nflip-flop scattering process, a spin flip of an electron is necessarily\naccompanied by a flop of an impurity spin in the opposite direction and the\ncorresponding change of the impurity Zeeman energy influences the final energy\nof the electron after the scattering event. This shift in the electron energies\nafter a spin flip-flop scattering processes, which usually has been overlooked\nin the literature, turns out to be especially important in the case of\nextremely diluted magnetic semiconductors in an external magnetic field. As a\nspecific example for a $\\mathbf{k}$-dependent effective magnetic field the\neffects of a Rashba field on the dynamics of the carrier-impurity correlations\nin a Hg$_{1-x-y}$Cd$_y$Mn$_x$Te quantum well are described. It is found that,\nalthough accounting for the Rashba interaction in the dynamics of the\ncorrelations leads to a modified $\\mathbf{k}$-space dynamics, the time\nevolution of the total carrier spin is not significantly influenced.\nFurthermore, a connection between the present theory and the description of\ncollective carrier-impurity precession modes is presented.\n", "  We show that the resonance shifts in the fluorescence of a cold gas of\nrubidium atoms substantially differ from those of thermal atomic ensembles that\nobey the standard continuous medium electrodynamics. The analysis is based on\nlarge-scale microscopic numerical simulations and experimental measurements of\nthe resonance shifts in a steady-state response in light propagation.\n", "  We analyze the properties of entangled random pure states of a quantum system\npartitioned into two smaller subsystems of dimensions $N$ and $M$. Framing the\nproblem in terms of random matrices with a fixed-trace constraint, we\nestablish, for arbitrary $N \\leq M$, a general relation between the $n$-point\ndensities and the cross-moments of the eigenvalues of the reduced density\nmatrix, i.e. the so-called Schmidt eigenvalues, and the analogous functionals\nof the eigenvalues of the Wishart-Laguerre ensemble of the random matrix\ntheory. This allows us to derive explicit expressions for two-level densities,\nand also an exact expression for the variance of von Neumann entropy at finite\n$N,M$. Then we focus on the moments $\\mathbb{E}\\{K^a\\}$ of the Schmidt number\n$K$, the reciprocal of the purity. This is a random variable supported on\n$[1,N]$, which quantifies the number of degrees of freedom effectively\ncontributing to the entanglement. We derive a wealth of analytical results for\n$\\mathbb{E}\\{K^a\\}$ for $N = 2$ and $N=3$ and arbitrary $M$, and also for\nsquare $N = M$ systems by spotting for the latter a connection with the\nprobability $P(x_{min}^{GUE} \\geq \\sqrt{2N}\\xi)$ that the smallest eigenvalue\n$x_{min}^{GUE}$ of a $N\\times N$ matrix belonging to the Gaussian Unitary\nEnsemble is larger than $\\sqrt{2N}\\xi$. As a byproduct, we present an exact\nasymptotic expansion for $P(x_{min}^{GUE} \\geq \\sqrt{2N}\\xi)$ for finite $N$ as\n$\\xi \\to \\infty$. Our results are corroborated by numerical simulations\nwhenever possible, with excellent agreement.\n", "  We report on fabrication of tubular optical waveguides buried in ZBLAN glass\nbased on transverse femtosecond laser direct writing. Irradiation in ZBLAN with\nfocused femtosecond laser pulses leads to decrease of refractive index in the\nmodified region. Tubular optical waveguides of variable mode areas are\nfabricated by forming the four sides of the cladding with slit-shaped\nfemtosecond laser pulses, ensuring single mode waveguiding with a mode field\ndimension as small as ~ 4 {\\mu}m.\n", "  Using a specially designed Monte Carlo algorithm with directed loops, we\ninvestigate the triangular lattice Ising antiferromagnet with coupling beyond\nnearest neighbour. We show that the first-order transition from the stripe\nstate to the paramagnet can be split, giving rise to an intermediate nematic\nphase in which algebraic correlations coexist with a broken symmetry.\nFurthermore, we demonstrate the emergence of several properties of a more\ntopological nature such as fractional edge excitations in the stripe state, the\nproliferation of double domain walls in the nematic phase, and the Kasteleyn\ntransition between them. Experimental implications are briefly discussed.\n", "  Using full opto-acoustic numerical simulations, we demonstrate enhancement\nand suppression of the SBS gain in a metamaterial comprising a subwavelength\ncubic array of dielectric spheres suspended in a dielectric background\nmaterial. We develop a general theoretical framework and present several\nnumerical examples using technologically important materials. For As$_2$S$_3$\nspheres in silicon, we achieve a gain enhancement of more than an order of\nmagnitude compared to pure silicon, and for GaAs spheres in silicon, full\nsuppression is obtained. The gain for As$_2$S$_3$ glass can also be strongly\nsuppressed by embedding silica spheres. The constituent terms of the gain\ncoefficient are shown to depend in a complex way on the filling fraction. We\nfind that electrostriction is the dominant effect behind the control of SBS in\nbulk media.\n", "  Lorentz-invariant massive gravity is usually associated with a strong\ncoupling scale $\\Lambda_3$. By including non-trivial effects from the\nStueckelberg modes, we show that about these vacua, one can push the strong\ncoupling scale to higher values and evade the linear vDVZ-discontinuity. For\ngeneric parameters of the theory and generic vacua for the Stueckelberg fields,\nthe $\\Lambda_2$-decoupling limit of the theory is well-behaved and free of any\nghost or gradient-like instabilities. We also discuss the implications for\nnonlinear sigma models with Lorentzian target spaces.\n", "  New sub-GeV vector bosons with couplings to muons but not electrons have been\ndiscussed in order to explain the muon's magnetic moment, the gap of\nhigh-energy neutrinos in IceCube or the proton radius puzzle. If such a light\nZ' not only violates lepton universality but also lepton flavor, as expected\nfor example from the recent hint for $h\\to\\mu\\tau$ at CMS, the two-body decay\nmode $\\tau \\to \\mu Z'$ opens up and for $M_{Z'} < 2 m_\\mu$ gives better\nconstraints than $\\tau\\to 3\\mu$ already with 20-year-old ARGUS limits. We\ndiscuss the general prospects and motivation of light vector bosons with\nlepton-flavor-violating couplings.\n", "  The coupled quantum dynamics of excitonic and vibrational degrees of freedom\nis investigated for high-dimensional models of the Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO)\ncomplex. This includes a seven and an eight-site model with 518 and 592\nharmonic vibrational modes, respectively. The coupling between local electronic\ntransitions and vibrations is described within the Huang-Rhys model using\nparameters that are obtained by discretization of an experimental spectral\ndensity. Different pathways of excitation energy flow are analyzed in terms of\nthe reduced one-exciton density matrix, focussing on the role of vibrational\nand vibronic excitation. Distinct features due to both competing time scales of\nvibrational and exciton motion and vibronically-assisted transfer are observed.\nThe question of the effect of initial state preparation is addressed by\ncomparing the case of an instantaneous Franck-Condon excitation at a single\nsite with that of a laser field excitation.\n", "  In collision-poor plasmas from space, e.g., the solar wind and planetary\nmagnetospheres, the kinetic anisotropy of the plasma particles is expected to\nbe regulated by the kinetic instabilities. Driven by an excess of ion (proton)\ntemperature perpendicular to the magnetic field $(~T_\\perp >T_\\parallel)$, the\nelectromagnetic ion-cyclotron (EMIC) instability is fast enough to constrain\nthe proton anisotropy, but the observations do not conform to the instability\nthresholds predicted by the standard theory for bi-Maxwellian models of the\nplasma particles. This paper presents an extended investigation of the EMIC\ninstability in the presence of suprathermal electrons which are ubiquitous in\nthese environments. The analysis is based on the kinetic (Vlasov-Maxwell)\ntheory assuming that both species, protons and electrons, may be anisotropic,\nand the EMIC unstable solutions are derived numerically providing an accurate\ndescription for conditions typically encountered in space plasmas. The effects\nof suprathermal populations are triggered by the electron anisotropy and the\ntemperature contrast between electrons and protons. For certain conditions the\nanisotropy thresholds exceed the limits of the proton anisotropy measured in\nthe solar wind considerably restraining the unstable regimes of the EMIC modes.\n", "  We aim to understand how the van der Waals force between neutral adatoms and\na graphene layer is modified by uniaxial strain and electron correlation\neffects. A detailed analysis is presented for three atoms (He, H, and Na) and\ngraphene strain ranging from weak to moderately strong. We show that the van\nder Waals potential can be significantly enhanced by strain, and present\napplications of our results to the problem of elastic scattering of atoms from\ngraphene. In particular we find that quantum reflection can be significantly\nsuppressed by strain, meaning that dissipative inelastic effects near the\nsurface become of increased importance. Furthermore we introduce a method to\nindependently estimate the Lennard-Jones parameters used in an effective model\nof He interacting with graphene, and determine how they depend on strain. At\nshort distances, we find that strain tends to reduce the interaction strength\nby pushing the location of the adsorption potential minima to higher distances\nabove the deformed graphene sheet. This opens up the exciting possibility of\nmechanically engineering an adsorption potential, with implications for the\nformation and observation of anisotropic low dimensional superfluid phases.\n", "  Valley asymmetry of the electron spectrum in transition metal dichalcogenides\n(TMDs) originates from the spin-orbit coupling. Presence of spin-orbit fields\nof opposite signs for electrons in K and K' valleys in combination with\npossibility of intervalley scattering result in a nontrivial spin dynamics.\nThis dynamics is reflected in the dependence of nonlocal resistance on external\nmagnetic field (the Hanle curve). We calculate theoretically the Hanle shape in\nTMDs. It appears that, unlike conventional materials without valley asymmetry,\nthe Hanle shape in TMDs is different for normal and parallel orientations of\nthe external field. For normal orientation, it has two peaks for slow\nintervalley scattering, while, for fast intervalley scattering the shape is\nusual. For parallel orientation, the Hanle curve exhibits a cusp at zero field.\nThis cusp is a signature of a slow-decaying valley-asymmetric mode of the spin\ndynamics.\n", "  In-depth understanding of the sorption mechanisms of organic pollutants, like\nthe antibiotic sulfanilamide (SAA), in soil requires a combined experimental\nand theoretical approach. Therefore, sorption experiments of SAA on\nwell-characterized samples of soil size-fractions were combined with the\nmodeling of SAA-soil-interaction via quantum chemical calculations. Freundlich\nunit capacities were determined in batch experiments and it was found that they\nincrease with the soil organic matter (SOM) content according to the order fine\nsilt > medium silt > clay > whole soil > coarse silt > sand. The calculated\nbinding energies for mass-spectrometrically quantified sorption sites followed\nthe order ionic species > peptides > carbohydrates > phenols and lignin\nmonomers > lignin dimers > heterocyclic compounds > fatty acids > sterols >\naromatic compounds > lipids, alkanes, and alkenes. SAA forms H-bonds through\nits different polar centers with polar SOM sorption sites. In contrast\ndispersion and {\\pi}-{\\pi}-interactions predominate the interaction of the\nsulfonamide aromatic ring with the non-polar moieties of SOM. Moreover, the\ndipole moment, partial atomic charges, and molecular volume of the SOM sorption\nsites are the main physical properties controlling the SAA-SOM-interaction. The\ncorrelation between experimental and theoretical results was established by\nreasonable estimates of the Freundlich unit capacities from the calculated\nbinding energies. Consequently, we suggest using this approach in forthcoming\nstudies to disclose the interactions of a wide range of organic pollutants with\nSOM.\n", "  In this work, we investigate the mass corrections of the doubly charmed\nbaryons up to $N^2LO$ in the extended-on-mass-shell (EOMS) renormalization\nscheme, comparing with the results of heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory.\nWe find that the terms from the heavy baryon approach are a subset of those\nobtained in the EOMS scheme. By fitting the lattice data, we can determine the\nparameters $\\tilde{m}$, $\\alpha$, $c_1$ and $c_7$ from the Lagrangian, while in\nthe heavy baryon approach no information on $c_1$ can be obtained from the\nbaryons mass. Correspondingly, the masses of $m_{\\Xi_{cc}}$ and\n$m_{\\Omega_{cc}}$ are predicted, in the EOMS scheme, extrapolating the results\nfrom different values of the charm quark and the pion masses of the lattice QCD\ncalculations.\n", "  We present a continuation of our theoretical research into the influence of\nco-solvent polarizability on a differential capacitance of the electric double\nlayer [EPL 111, 28002 (2015)]. We formulate a modified Poisson-Boltzmann\ntheory, using the formalism of density functional approach on the level of\nlocal density approximation taking into account the electrostatic interactions\nof ions and co-solvent molecules as well as their excluded volume. We derive\nthe modified Poisson-Boltzmann equation, considering the three-component\nsymmetric lattice gas model as a reference system and minimizing the grand\nthermodynamic potential with respect to the electrostatic potential. We apply\npresent modified Poisson-Boltzmann equation to the electric double layer\ntheory.\n", "  Spatio-temporal mode coupling in highly multimode physical systems permits\nnew routes for exploring complex instabilities and forming coherent wave\nstructures. We present here the first experimental demonstration of multiple\ngeometric parametric instability sidebands, generated in the frequency domain\nthrough resonant space-time coupling, owing to the natural periodic spatial\nself-imaging of a multimode quasi-continuous-wave beam in a standard\ngraded-index multimode fiber. The input beam was launched in the fiber by means\nof an amplified microchip laser emitting sub-nanosecond pulses at 1064 nm. The\nexperimentally observed frequency spacing among sidebands agrees well with\nanalytical predictions and numerical simulations. The first order peaks are\nlocated at the considerably large detuning of 123.5 THz from the pump. These\nresults open the remarkable possibility to convert a near-infrared laser\ndirectly into a broad spectral range spanning visible and infrared wavelengths,\nby means of a single resonant parametric nonlinear effect occurring in the\nnormal dispersion regime. As a further evidence of our strong space-time\ncoupling regime, we observed the striking effect that all of the different\nsideband peaks were carried by a well-defined and stable bell-shaped spatial\nprofile.\n", "  Space- and time-resolved measurements of spin drift and diffusion are\nperformed on a GaAs-hosted two-dimensional electron gas. For spins where\nforward drift is compensated by backward diffusion, we find a precession\nfrequency in absence of an external magnetic field. The frequency depends\nlinearly on the drift velocity and is explained by the cubic Dresselhaus\nspin-orbit interaction, for which drift leads to a spin precession angle twice\nthat of spins that diffuse the same distance.\n", "  The macroscopic surface electric susceptibility determines the linear optical\nproperties of an insulating single-layer two-dimensional atomic crystal, and\ncan be expressed in terms of the microscopic polarizability of the atoms. We\ncompute the local electric field acting on a single atom, both for the static\nand the dynamic case, as the superposition of the external applied electric\nfield and the fields generated by the induced dipoles in the crystal. We find\nthat, in the dynamic case, retardation effects dephase the local electric field\nwith respect to the incident one. This explains why the Fresnel coefficients of\na single-layer two-dimensional atomic crystal are intrinsically complex\nquantities, even when a null macroscopic surface conductivity is assumed.\n", "  The relation between seismic moment and fractured area is crucial to\nearthquake hazard analysis. Experimental catalogs show multiple scaling\nbehaviors, with some controversy concerning the exponent value in the large\nearthquake regime. Here, we show that the original Olami, Feder, and\nChristensen model does not capture experimental findings. Taking into account\nheterogeneous friction, the visco elastic nature of faults together with\nfinite-size effects, we are able to reproduce the different scaling regimes of\nfield observations. We provide an explanation for the origin of the two\ncrossovers between scaling regimes, which are shown to be controlled both by\nthe geometry and the bulk dynamics.\n", "  The point contact tunnel junctions between a one-dimensional topological\nsuperconductor and single-channel quantum Hall (QH) liquids are investigated\ntheoretically with bosonization technology and renormalization group methods.\nFor the $\\nu=1$ integer QH liquid, the universal low-energy tunneling transport\nis governed by the perfect Andreev reflection fixed point with quantized\nzero-bias conductance $G(0)=2e^{2}/h$, which can serve as a definitive\nfingerprint of the existence of a Majorana fermion. For the $\\nu =1/m$ Laughlin\nfractional QH liquids, its transport is governed by the perfect normal\nreflection fixed point with vanishing zero-bias conductance and bias-dependent\nconductance $G(V) \\sim V^{m-2}$. Our setup is within reach of present\nexperimental techniques.\n", "  We study the scaling behavior of the relaxation dynamics to thermal\nequilibrium when a quantum system is near the quantum critical point. In\nparticular, we investigate systems whose relaxation dynamics is described by a\nLindblad master equation. We find that the universal scaling behavior not only\nexhibits in the equilibrium stage at the long-time limit, but also manifests\nitself in the non-equilibrium relaxation process. While the critical behavior\nis dictated by the low-lying energy levels of the Hamiltonian, the dissipative\npart in the Lindblad equation also plays important roles in two aspects: First,\nthe dissipative part makes the high energy levels decay fast after which the\nuniversal behavior controlled by the low-lying modes emerges. Second, the\ndissipation rate gives rise to a time scale that affects the scaling behavior.\nWe confirm our theory by solving the Lindblad equation for the one-dimensional\ntransverse-field Ising model.\n", "  General relativity is supported by great experimental evidence. Yet there is\na lot of interest in precisely setting its limits with on going and future\nexperiments. A question to answer is about the validity of the Strong\nEquivalence Principle. Ground experiments and Lunar Laser Ranging have provided\nthe best upper limit on the Nordtvedt parameter $\\sigma[\\eta]=4.4\\times\n10^{-4}$. With the future planetary mission BepiColombo, this parameter will be\nfurther improved by at least an order of magnitude. In this paper we envisage\nyet another possible testing environment with spacecraft ranging towards the\nnearby Sun-Earth collinear Lagrangian points. Neglecting errors in planetary\nmasses and ephemerides, we forecast $\\sigma[\\eta]=6.4\\,(2.0)\\times10^{-4}$ (5\nyr integration time) via ranging towards $L_1$ in a realistic (optimistic)\nscenario depending on current (future) range capabilities and knowledge of the\nEarth's ephemerides. A combined measurement, $L_1$+$L_2$, gives instead\n$4.8\\,(1.7)\\times10^{-4}$. In the optimistic scenario a single measurement of\none year would be enough to reach $\\approx3\\times10^{-4}$. All figures are\ncomparable with Lunar Laser Ranging, but worse than BepiColombo. Performances\ncould be much improved if data were integrated over time and over the number of\nsatellites flying around either of the two Lagrangian points. We point out that\nsome systematics (gravitational perturbations of other planets or figure\neffects) are much more in control compared to other experiments. We do not\nadvocate a specific mission to constrain the Strong Equivalence Principle, but\nwe do suggest analysing ranging data of present and future spacecrafts flying\naround $L_1$/$L_2$ (one key mission is, for instance, LISA Pathfinder). This\nspacecraft ranging would be a new and complementary probe to constrain the\nStrong Equivalence Principle in space.\n", "  We study the texture of helical currents in metallic planar strips in the\npresence of Rashba spin-orbit coupling (RSOC) on the lattice at zero\ntemperature. In the noninteracting case, and in the absence of external\nelectromagnetic sources, we determine by exact numerical diagonalization of the\nsingle-particle Hamiltonian, the distribution across the strip section of these\nRashba helical currents (RHC) as well as their sign oscillation, as a function\nof the RSOC strength, strip width, electron filling, and strip boundary\nconditions. Then, we study the effects of charge currents introduced into the\nsystem by an Aharonov-Bohm flux for the case of rings or by a voltage bias in\nthe case of open strips. The former setup is studied by variational Monte\nCarlo, and the later, by the time-dependent density-matrix-renormalization\ngroup technique. Particularly for strips formed by two, three and four coupled\nchains, we show how these RHC vary in the presence of such induced charge\ncurrent, and how their differences between spin-up and spin-down electron\ncurrents on each chain, help to explain the distribution across the strip of\ncharge currents, both of the spin conserving and the spin flipping types. We\nalso predict the appearance of polarized charge currents on each chain.\nFinally, we show that these Rashba helical currents and their derived features\nremain in the presence of an on-site Hubbard repulsion as long as the system\nremains metallic, at quarter filling, and even at half-filling where a\nMott-Hubbard metal-insulator transition occurs for large Hubbard repulsion.\n", "  Recent studies of higher spin theory in three dimensions concentrate on\nWilson loops in Chern-Simons theory, which in the classical limit reduce to\npeculiar corner matrix elements between the highest and lowest weight states in\na given representation of SL(N). Despite these \"skew\" tau-functions can seem\nvery different from conventional ones, which are the matrix elements between\nthe two highest weight states, they also satisfy the Toda recursion between\ndifferent fundamental representations. Moreover, in the most popular examples\nthey possess simple representations in terms of matrix models and Schur\nfunctions. We provide a brief introduction to this new interesting field,\nwhich, after quantization, can serve as an additional bridge between knot and\nintegrability theories.\n", "  We address the characterization of dissipative bosonic channels and show that\nestimation of the loss rate by Gaussian probes (coherent or squeezed) is\nimproved in the presence of Kerr nonlinearity. In particular, enhancement of\nprecision may be substantial for short interaction time, i.e. for media of\nmoderate size, e.g. biological samples. We analyze in detail the behaviour of\nthe quantum Fisher information (QFI), and determine the values of nonlinearity\nmaximizing the QFI as a function of the interaction time and of the parameters\nof the input signal. We also discuss the precision achievable by photon\ncounting and quadrature measurement and present additional results for\ntruncated, few-photon, probe signals. Finally, we discuss the origin of the\nprecision enhancement, showing that it cannot be linked quantitatively to the\nnon-Gaussianity of the interacting probe signal.\n", "  We consider a scenario where, along with the usual Higgs doublet, two scalar\ntriplets are present. The extension of the triplet sector is required for the\nType~II mechanism for the generation of neutrino masses, if this mechanism has\nto generate a neutrino mass matrix with two-zero texture. One CP-violating\nphase has been retained in the scalar potential of the model, and all\nparameters have been chosen consistently with the observed neutrino mass and\nmixing patterns. We find that a large phase ($\\gtrsim 60^{\\circ}$) splits the\ntwo doubly-charged scalar mass eigenstates wider apart, so that the decay\n$H_1^{++} \\rightarrow H_2^{++} h$ is dominant (with h being the $125$ GeV\nscalar). We identify a set of benchmark points where this decay dominates. This\nis complementary to the situation, reported in our earlier work, where the\nheavier doubly-charged scalar decays as $H_1^{++} \\rightarrow H_2^+ W^+$. We\npoint out the rather spectacular signal, ensuing from $H_1^{++} \\rightarrow\nH_2^{++} h$, in the form of Higgs plus same-sign dilepton peak, which can be\nobserved at the Large Hadron Collider.\n", "  We study wave propagation in a draining bathtub: a fluid-mechanical black\nhole analogue in which perturbations are governed by a Klein-Gordon equation on\nan effective Lorentzian geometry. Like the Kerr spacetime, the draining bathtub\ngeometry possesses an (effective) horizon, an ergosphere and null circular\norbits. We propose that a `pulse' disturbance may be used to map out the\nlight-cone of the effective geometry. First, we apply the eikonal approximation\nto elucidate the link between wavefronts, null geodesic congruences and the\nRaychaudhuri equation. Next, we solve the wave equation numerically in the time\ndomain using the method of lines. Starting with Gaussian initial data, we\ndemonstrate that a pulse will propagate along a null congruence and thus trace\nout the light-cone of the effective geometry. Our numerical results reveal\nfeatures, such as wavefront intersections, frame-dragging, winding and\ninterference effects, that are closely associated with the presence of null\ncircular orbits and the ergosphere.\n", "  We report a systematic study of temperature- and field-dependent charge\n($\\boldsymbol{\\rho}$) and entropy ($\\mathbf{S}$) transport in the heavy-fermion\nsuperconductor CeIrIn$_5$. Its large positive thermopower $S_{xx}$ is typical\nof Ce-based Kondo lattice systems, and strong electronic correlations play an\nimportant role in enhancing the Nernst signal $S_{xy}$. By separating the\noff-diagonal Peltier coefficient $\\alpha_{xy}$ from $S_{xy}$, we find that\n$\\alpha_{xy}$ becomes positive and greatly enhanced at temperatures well above\nthe bulk $T_c$. Compared with the non-magnetic analog LaIrIn$_5$, these results\nsuggest vortexlike excitations in a precursor state to unconventional\nsuperconductivity in CeIrIn$_5$. This study sheds new light on the similarity\nof heavy-fermion and cuprate superconductors and on the possibility of states\nnot characterized by the amplitude of an order parameter.\n", "  The analysis of diffusion processes in real-world propagation scenarios often\ninvolves estimating variables that are not directly observed. These hidden\nvariables include parental relationships, the strengths of connections between\nnodes, and the moments of time that infection occurs. In this paper, we propose\na framework in which all three sets of parameters are assumed to be hidden and\nwe develop a Bayesian approach to infer them. After justifying the model\nassumptions, we evaluate the performance efficiency of our proposed approach\nthrough numerical simulations on synthetic datasets and real-world diffusion\nprocesses.\n", "  We study through Monte Carlo simulations and finite-size scaling analysis the\nnonequilibrium phase transitions of the majority-vote model taking place on\nspatially embedded networks. These structures are built from an underlying\nregular lattice over which long-range connections are randomly added according\nto the probability, $P_{ij}\\sim{r^{-\\alpha}}$, where $r_{ij}$ is the Manhattan\ndistance between nodes $i$ and $j$, and the exponent $\\alpha$ is a controlling\nparameter [J. M. Kleinberg, Nature 406, 845 (2000)]. Our results show that the\ncollective behavior of this system exhibits a continuous order-disorder phase\ntransition at a critical parameter, which is a decreasing function of the\nexponent $\\alpha$. Precisely, considering the scaling functions and the\ncritical exponents calculated, we conclude that the system undergoes a\ncrossover among distinct universality classes. For $\\alpha\\le3$ the critical\nbehavior is described by mean-field exponents, while for $\\alpha\\ge4$ it\nbelongs to the Ising universality class. Finally, in the region where the\ncrossover occurs, $3<\\alpha<4$, the critical exponents are dependent on\n$\\alpha$.\n", "  In this letter we provide a complete holographic reconstruction of the cubic\ncouplings in the minimal bosonic higher-spin theory in AdS$_{d+1}$. For this\npurpose we also determine the OPE coefficients of all single-trace conserved\ncurrents in the $d$-dimensional free scalar $O\\left(N\\right)$ vector model, and\ncompute the tree-level three-point Witten diagram amplitudes for a generic\ncubic interaction of higher-spin gauge fields in the metric-like formulation.\n", "  Background: Models describing nuclear fragmentation and fragmentation-fission\ndeliver important input for planning nuclear physics experiments and future\nradioactive ion beam facilities. These models are usually benchmarked against\ndata from stable beam experiments. In the future, two-step fragmentation\nreactions with exotic nuclei as stepping stones are a promising tool to reach\nthe most neutron-rich nuclei, creating a need for models to describe also these\nreactions.\n  Purpose: We want to extend the presently available data on fragmentation\nreactions towards the light exotic region on the nuclear chart. Furthermore, we\nwant to improve the understanding of projectile fragmentation especially for\nunstable isotopes.\n  Method: We have measured projectile fragments from 10,12-18C and 10-15B\nisotopes colliding with a carbon target. These measurements were all performed\nwithin one experiment, which gives rise to a very consistent dataset. We\ncompare our data to model calculations.\n  Results: One-proton removal cross sections with different final neutron\nnumbers (1pxn) for relativistic 10,12-18C and 10-15B isotopes impinging on a\ncarbon target. Comparing model calculations to the data, we find that EPAX is\nnot able to describe the data satisfactorily. Using ABRABLA07 on the other\nhand, we find that the average excitation energy per abraded nucleon needs to\nbe decreased from 27 MeV to 8.1 MeV. With that decrease ABRABLA07 describes the\ndata surprisingly well.\n  Conclusions: Extending the available data towards light unstable nuclei with\na consistent set of new data have allowed for a systematic investigation of the\nrole of the excitation energy induced in projectile fragmentation. Most\nstriking is the apparent mass dependence of the average excitation energy per\nabraded nucleon. Nevertheless, this parameter, which has been related to\nfinal-state interactions, requires further study.\n", "  Most inflationary models predict primordial perturbations to be statistically\nisotropic and homogeneous. Cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations,\nhowever, indicate a possible departure from statistical isotropy in the form of\na dipolar power modulation at large angular scales. Alternative models of\ninflation, beyond the simplest single-field slow-roll models, can generate a\nsmall power asymmetry, consistent with these observations. Observations of\nclustering of quasars show, however, agreement with statistical isotropy at\nmuch smaller angular scales. Here, we propose to use off-diagonal components of\nthe angular power spectrum of the 21-cm fluctuations during the dark ages to\ntest this power asymmetry. We forecast results for the planned SKA radio array,\na future radio array, and the cosmic-variance-limited case as a theoretical\nproof of principle. Our results show that the 21-cm line power spectrum will\nenable access to information at very small scales and at different redshift\nslices, thus improving upon the current CMB constraints by $\\sim 2$ orders of\nmagnitude for a dipolar asymmetry and by $\\sim 1-3$ orders of magnitude for a\nquadrupolar asymmetry case.\n", "  This paper deals with the steady-state polytropic fluid accretion onto a\nhigher-dimensional Reissner-Nordstr$\\ddot{o}$m black hole. We formulate the\ngeneralized mass flux conservation equation, energy flux conservation and\nrelativistic Bernoulli equation to discuss the accretion process. The critical\naccretion is investigated by finding critical radius, critical sound velocity\nand critical flow velocity. We also explore gas compression and temperature\nprofiles to analyze the asymptotic behavior. It is found that the results for\nSchwarzschild black hole are recovered when $q=0$ in four dimensions. We\nconclude that accretion process in higher dimensions becomes slower in the\npresence of charge.\n", "  The mass, decay constant and width of a hypothetical charmed partner $X_c$ of\nthe newly observed exotic $X_b(5568)$ state are calculated using a technique of\nQCD sum rule method. The $X_c=[su][\\overline{c}\\overline{d}]$ state with\n$J^{P}=0^{+}$ is described employing two types of the diquark-antidiquark\ninterpolating currents. The evaluation of the mass $m_{X_c}$ and decay constant\n$f_{X_c}$ is carried out utilizing the two-point sum rule method by including\nvacuum condensates up to eight dimensions. The widths of the decay channels\n$X_c \\to D_s^{-} \\pi^{+}$ and $X_c \\to D^{0} K^{0}$ are also found. To this\nend, the strong couplings $g_{X_{c}D_{s}\\pi}$ and $g_{X_{c}D K}$ are computed\nby means of QCD sum rules on the light-cone and soft-meson approximation.\n", "  Optically trapped nanospheres in high-vaccum experience little friction and\nhence are promising for ultra-sensitive force detection. Here we demonstrate\nmeasurement times exceeding $10^5$ seconds and zeptonewton force sensitivity\nwith laser-cooled silica nanospheres trapped in an optical lattice. The\nsensitivity achieved exceeds that of conventional room-temperature solid-state\nforce sensors, and enables a variety of applications including electric field\nsensing, inertial sensing, and gravimetry. The optical potential allows the\nparticle to be confined in a number of possible trapping sites, with precise\nlocalization at the anti-nodes of the optical standing wave. By studying the\nmotion of a particle which has been moved to an adjacent trapping site, the\nknown spacing of the lattice anti-nodes can be used to calibrate the\ndisplacement spectrum of the particle. Finally, we study the dependence of the\ntrap stability and lifetime on the laser intensity and gas pressure, and\nexamine the heating rate of the particle in high vacuum in the absence of\noptical feedback cooling.\n", "  An effective self-consistent model is derived and used to study the dynamics\nof an electron gas confined in a nonparabolic and anisotropic quantum well.\nThis approach is based on the equations of quantum hydrodynamics, which\nincorporate quantum and nonlinear effects in an approximate fashion. The\neffective model consists of a set of six coupled differential equations\n(dynamical system) for the electric dipole and the size of the electron gas.\nUsing this model we show that: (i) High harmonic generation is related to the\nappearance of chaos in the phase space, as attested by related Poincar\\'e\nsections; (ii) Higher order harmonics can be excited efficiently and with\nrelatively weak driving fields by making use of chirped electromagnetic waves.\n", "  Previous studies have shown the existence of an excess of emission at\nsubmillimeter (submm) and millimeter (mm) wavelengths in the spectral energy\ndistribution (SED) of many low-metallicity galaxies. The goal of the present\nstudy is to model separately the emission from the star forming (SF) component\nand the emission from the diffuse interstellar medium (ISM) in the nearby\nspiral galaxy M33. We decomposed the observed SED of M33 into its SF and\ndiffuse components. Mid-infrared (MIR) and far-infrared (FIR) fluxes were\nextracted from Spitzer and Herschel data. At submm and mm wavelengths, we used\nground-based observations from APEX to measure the emission from the SF\ncomponent and data from the Planck space telescope to estimate the diffuse\nemission. Both components were separately fitted using radiation transfer\nmodels based on standard dust properties and a realistic geometry. Both modeled\nSEDs were combined to build the global SED of M33. In addition, the radiation\nfield necessary to power the dust emission in our modeling was compared with\nobservations from GALEX, Sloan, and Spitzer. Our modeling is able to reproduce\nthe observations at MIR and FIR wavelengths, but we found a strong excess of\nemission at submm and mm wavelengths, where the model expectations severely\nunderestimate the LABOCA and Planck fluxes. We also found that the ultraviolet\n(UV) radiation escaping the galaxy is 70% higher than the model predictions. We\ndetermined a gas-to-dust mass ratio Gdust~100, significantly lower than the\nvalue expected from the sub-solar metallicity of M33. We discussed different\nhypotheses to explain the discrepancies found in our study (i.e., excess of\nemission at submm and mm wavelengths, deficit of UV attenuation, and abnormally\nlow value of Gdust), concluding that different dust properties in M33 is the\nmost plausible explanation.\n", "  Dark energy equation of state $w(z)$ parametrizations with two parameters and\ngiven monotonicity are generically either convex or concave functions. This\nmakes them suitable for fitting either freezing or thawing quintessence models\nbut not both simultaneously. Fitting a dataset based on a freezing model with\nan unsuitable (concave when increasing) $w(z)$ parametrization (like CPL) can\nlead to significant misleading features like crossing of the phantom divide\nline, incorrect $w(z=0)$, incorrect slope \\etc that are not present in the\nunderlying cosmological model. To demonstrate this fact we generate scattered\ncosmological data both at the level of $w(z)$ and the luminosity distance\n$D_L(z)$ based on either thawing or freezing quintessence models and fit them\nusing parametrizations of convex and of concave type. We then compare\nstatistically significant features of the best fit $w(z)$ with actual features\nof the underlying model. We thus verify that the use of unsuitable\nparametrizations can lead to misleading conclusions. In order to avoid these\nproblems it is important to either use both convex and concave parametrizations\nand select the one with the best $\\chi^2$ or use principal component analysis\nthus splitting the redshift range into independent bins. In the latter case\nhowever, significant information about the slope of $w(z)$ at high redshifts is\nlost. Finally, we propose a new family of parametrizations (nCPL) $w(z)=w_0+w_a\n(\\frac{z}{1+z})^n$ which generalizes the CPL and interpolates between thawing\nand freezing parametrizations as the parameter $n$ increases to values larger\nthan 1.\n", "  We propose a new method of calculating electronically excited states that\ncombines a density functional theory (DFT) based ground state calculation with\na linear response treatment that employs approximations used in the\ntime-dependent density functional based tight binding (TD-DFTB) approach. The\nnew method termed TD-DFT+TB does not rely on the DFTB parametrization and is\ntherefore applicable to systems involving all combinations of elements. We show\nthat the new method yields UV/Vis absorption spectra that are in excellent\nagreement with computationally much more expensive time-dependent density\nfunctional theory (TD-DFT) calculations. Errors in vertical excitation energies\nare reduced by a factor of two compared to TD-DFTB.\n", "  We show that homogeneous black strings of third-order Lovelock theory are\nunstable under s-wave perturbations. This analysis is done in dimension $D=9$,\nwhich is the lowest dimension that allows the existence of homogeneous black\nstrings in a theory that contains only the third-order Lovelock term in the\nLagrangian. As is the case in general relativity, the instability is produced\nby long wavelength perturbations and it stands for the perturbative counterpart\nof a thermal instability. We also provide a comparative analysis of the\ninstabilities of black strings at a fixed radius in general relativity,\nGauss-Bonnet and third-order Lovelock theory. We show that the minimum critical\nwavelength that triggers the instability grows with the power of the curvature\ndefined in the Lagrangian. The maximum exponential growth during the time of\nthe perturbation is the largest in general relativity and it decreases with the\nnumber of curvatures involved in the Lagrangian.\n", "  The high-temperature ferromagnet MnBi continues to receive attention as a\ncandidate to replace rare-earth-containing permanent magnets in applications\nabove room temperature. This is due to a high Curie temperature, large magnetic\nmoments, and a coercivity that increases with temperature. The synthesis of\nMnBi also allows for crystals that are free of interstitial Mn, enabling more\ndirect access to the key interactions underlying the physical properties of\nbinary Mn-based ferromagnets. In this work, we use inelastic neutron scattering\nto measure the spin waves of MnBi in order to characterize the magnetic\nexchange at low temperature. Consistent with the spin reorientation that occurs\nbelow 140 K, we do not observe a spin gap in this system above our experimental\nresolution. A Heisenberg model was fit to the spin wave data in order to\ncharacterize the long-range nature of the exchange. It was found that\ninteractions up to sixth nearest neighbor are required to fully parameterize\nthe spin waves. Surprisingly, the nearest-neighbor term is antiferromagnetic,\nand the realization of a ferromagnetic ground state relies on the more numerous\nferromagnetic terms beyond nearest neighbor, suggesting that the ferromagnetic\nground state arises as a consequence of the long-ranged interactions in the\nsystem.\n", "  The isospin-asymmetry dependence of the nuclear matter equation of state\nobtained from microscopic chiral two- and three-body interactions in\nsecond-order many-body perturbation theory is examined in detail. The\nquadratic, quartic and sextic coefficients in the Maclaurin expansion of the\nfree energy per particle of infinite homogeneous nuclear matter with respect to\nthe isospin asymmetry are extracted numerically using finite differences, and\nthe resulting polynomial isospin-asymmetry parametrizations are compared to the\nfull isospin-asymmetry dependence of the free energy. It is found that in the\nlow-temperature and high-density regime where the radius of convergence of the\nexpansion is generically zero, the inclusion of higher-order terms beyond the\nleading quadratic approximation leads overall to a significantly poorer\ndescription of the isospin-asymmetry dependence. In contrast, at high\ntemperatures and densities well below nuclear saturation density, the\ninteraction contributions to the higher-order coefficients are negligible and\nthe deviations from the quadratic approximation are predominantly from the\nnoninteracting term in the many-body perturbation series. Furthermore, we\nextract the leading logarithmic term in the isospin-asymmetry expansion of the\nequation of state at zero temperature from the analysis of linear combinations\nof finite differences. It is shown that the logarithmic term leads to a\nconsiderably improved description of the isospin-asymmetry dependence at zero\ntemperature.\n", "  Context. The eclipsing binary GU Mon is located in the star-forming cluster\nDolidze 25, which has the lowest metallicity measured in a Milky Way young\ncluster. Aims. GU Mon has been identified as a short-period eclipsing binary\nwith two early B-type components. We set out to derive its orbital and stellar\nparameters. Methods. We present a comprehensive analysis, including B and V\nlight curves and 11 high-resolution spectra, to verify the orbital period and\ndetermine parameters. We use the stellar atmosphere code FASTWIND to obtain\nstellar parameters and create templates for cross-correlation. We obtain a\nmodel to fit the light and radial-velocity curves using the Wilson-Devinney\ncode iteratively and simultaneously. Results. The two components of GU Mon are\nidentical stars of spectral type B1 V, with the same mass and temperature. The\nlightcurves are typical of an EW-type binary. The spectroscopic and photometric\nanalyses agree on a period of 0.896640 +- 0.000007 d. We determine a mass of\n9.0 +- 0.6 Msun for each component and temperatures of 28 000 +- 2 000 K. Both\nvalues are consistent with the spectral type. The two stars are overfilling\ntheir respective Roche lobes, sharing a common envelope, and therefore the\norbit is synchronised and circularised. Conclusions. The GU Mon system has a\nfill-out factor above 0.8, containing two dwarf B-type stars on the main\nsequence. The two stars are in a very advanced stage of interaction, with their\nextreme physical similarity likely due to the common envelope. The expected\nevolution of such a system will very probably lead to a merger while still on\nthe main sequence.\n", "  We present a source of polarization entangled photon pairs based on\nspontaneous parametric downconversion engineered for frequency uncorrelated\ntelecom photon generation. Our source provides photon pairs that display,\nsimultaneously, the key properties for high-performance quantum information and\nfundamental quantum science tasks. Specifically, the source provides for high\nheralding efficiency, high quantum state purity and high entangled state\nfidelity at the same time. Among different tests we apply to our source we\nobserve almost perfect non-classical interference between photons from\nindependent sources with a visibility of $(100\\pm5)\\%$.\n", "  The Sturm-Liouville eigenvalue method is employed to analytically investigate\nthe properties of holographic superconductors in higher dimensions in the\nframework of Born-Infeld electrodynamics incorporating the effects of\nnoncommutative spacetime. In the background of pure Einstein gravity in\nnoncommutative spacetime, we obtain the relation between the critical\ntemperature and the charge density. We also obtain the value of the\ncondensation operator and the critical exponent. Our findings suggest that\nhigher the value of noncommutative parameter and Born-Infeld parameter make the\ncondensate harder to form. We also observe that the critical temperature\ndepends on the mass of the black hole and higher value of black hole mass is\nfavourable for the formation of the condensate.\n", "  We present a new hybrid Cauchy-characteristic evolution method that is\nparticularly suited for the study of gravitational collapse in\nspherically-symmetric asymptotically (global) Anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetimes.\nThe Cauchy evolution allows us to track the scalar field through the different\nbounces off the AdS boundary while the characteristic method can bring us very\nclose to the point of formation of an apparent horizon. Here, we describe all\nthe details of the method, including the transition between the two evolution\nschemes and the details of the numerical implementation for the case of\nmassless scalar fields. We use this scheme to provide more numerical evidence\nfor a recent conjecture on the power-law scaling of the apparent horizon mass\nresulting from the collapse of subcritical configurations. We also compute the\ncritical exponents and echoing periods for a number of critical points and\nconfirm the expectation that their values should be the same as in the\nasymptotically-flat case.\n", "  Time-dependent density functional theory is widely used to describe\nexcitations of many-fermion systems. In its many applications, 3D\ncoordinate-space representation is used, and infinite-domain calculations are\nlimited to a finite volume represented by a box. For finite quantum systems\n(atoms, molecules, nuclei), the commonly used periodic or reflecting boundary\nconditions introduce spurious quantization of the continuum states and\nartificial reflections from boundary; hence, an incorrect treatment of\nevaporated particles. These artifacts can be practically cured by introducing\nabsorbing boundary conditions (ABC) through an absorbing potential in a certain\nboundary region sufficiently far from the described system. But also the\ncalculations of infinite matter (crystal electrons, quantum fluids, neutron\nstar crust) suffer artifacts from a finite computational box. In this regime,\ntwist- averaged boundary conditions (TABC) have been used successfully to\ndiminish the finite-volume effects. In this work, we extend TABC to\ntime-dependent framework and apply it to resolve the box artifacts for finite\nquantum systems using as test case small- and large-amplitude nuclear\nvibrations. We demonstrate that by using such a method, one can reduce finite\nvolume effects drastically without adding any additional parameters. While they\nare almost equivalent in the linear regime, TABC and ABC differ in the\nnonlinear regime in their treatment of evaporated particles.\n", "  Context. The origin of blazar variability, seen from radio up to gamma rays,\nis still a heavily debated matter and broadband flares offer a unique testbed\ntowards a better understanding of these extreme objects. Such an energetic\noutburst was detected by Fermi/LAT in 2008 from the blazar PKS 1502+106. The\noutburst was observed from gamma rays down to radio frequencies.\n  Aims. Through the delay between flare maxima at different radio frequencies,\nwe study the frequency-dependent position of the unit-opacity surface and infer\nits absolute position with respect to the jet base. This nuclear opacity\nprofile enables the magnetic field tomography of the jet. We also localize the\ngamma-ray emission region and explore the mechanism producing the flare.\n  Methods. The radio flare of PKS 1502+106 is studied through single-dish flux\ndensity measurements at 12 frequencies in the range 2.64 to 226.5 GHz. To\nquantify it, we employ both a Gaussian process regression and a discrete\ncross-correlation function analysis.\n  Results. We find that the light curve parameters (flare amplitude and\ncross-band delays) show a power-law dependence on frequency. Delays decrease\nwith frequency, and the flare amplitudes increase up to about 43 GHz and then\ndecay. This behavior is consistent with a shock propagating downstream the jet.\nThe self-absorbed radio cores are located between about 10 and 4 pc from the\njet base and their magnetic field strengths range between 14 and 176 mG, at the\nfrequencies 2.64 to 86.24 GHz. Finally, the gamma-ray active region is located\nat (1.9 +/- 1.1) pc away from the jet base.\n", "  A new method to determine the CO-to-H$_2$ conversion factor $X_{\\rm CO}$\nusing absorption of diffuse X-ray emission by local molecular clouds was\ndeveloped. It was applied to the Ophiucus (G353+17) and Corona Australis\n(G359-18) clouds using CO-line and soft X-ray archival data. We obtained a\nvalue $X_{\\rm CO} =1.85 \\pm 0.45 \\times 10^{20} {\\rm H_2 cm^{-2}/(K~ km~\ns^{-1})}$ as the average of least-$chi^2$ fitting results for R4 (0.7 keV) and\nR5 (0.8 keV) bands.\n  Full resolution pdf available at\nhttp://www.ioa.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~sofue/htdocs/2016Xco/\n", "  In this paper we propose a linear quiver with gauge groups of increasing rank\nas field theory dual to the AdS_5 background constructed by Sfetsos and\nThompson through non-Abelian T-duality. The formalism to study 4d N=2 SUSY CFTs\ndeveloped by Gaiotto and Maldacena is essential for our proposal. We point out\nan interesting relation between (Hopf) Abelian and non-Abelian T-dual\nbackgrounds that allows to see both backgrounds as different limits of a\nsolution constructed by Maldacena and Nunez. This suggests different\ncompletions of the long quiver describing the CFT dual to the non-Abelian\nT-dual background that match different observables.\n", "  We consider the dissipative single-qubit circuit QED architecture in which\nthe atomic transition frequency undergoes a weak external time-modulation. For\nsinusoidal modulation with linearly varying frequency we derive effective\nHamiltonians that resemble the Landau-Zener problem of finite duration\nassociated to a two- or multi-level systems. The corresponding off-diagonal\ncoupling coefficients originate either from the rotating or the\ncounter-rotating terms in the Rabi Hamiltonian, depending on the values of the\nmodulation frequency. It is demonstrated that in the dissipation less case one\ncan accomplish almost complete transitions between the eigenstates of the bare\nRabi Hamiltonian even for relatively short duration of the frequency sweep. To\nassess the experimental feasibility of our scheme we solved numerically the\nphenomenological and the microscopic quantum master equations in the Markovian\nregime at zero temperature. Both models exhibit qualitatively similar behavior\nand indicate that photon generation from vacuum via effective Landau-Zener\ntransitions could be implemented with the current technology on the timescales\nof a few microseconds. Moreover, unlike the harmonic dynamical Casimir effect\nimplementations, our proposal does not require the precise knowledge of the\nresonant modulation frequency to accomplish meaningful photon generation.\n", "  We study the influence of diffusion on NMR experiments when the molecules\nundergo random motion under the influence of a force field, and place special\nemphasis on parabolic (Hookean) potentials. To this end, the problem is studied\nusing path integral methods. Explicit relationships are derived for commonly\nemployed gradient waveforms involving pulsed and oscillating gradients. The\nBloch-Torrey equation, describing the temporal evolution of magnetization, is\nmodified by incorporating potentials. A general solution to this equation is\nobtained for the case of parabolic potential by adopting the multiple\ncorrelation function (MCF) formalism, which has been used in the past to\nquantify the effects of restricted diffusion. Both analytical and MCF results\nwere found to be in agreement with random walk simulations. A multi-dimensional\nformulation of the problem is introduced that leads to a new characterization\nof diffusion anisotropy. Unlike for the case of traditional methods that employ\na diffusion tensor, anisotropy originates from the tensorial force constant,\nand bulk diffusivity is retained in the formulation. Our findings suggest that\nsome features of the NMR signal that have traditionally been attributed to\nrestricted diffusion are accommodated by the Hookean model. Under certain\nconditions, the formalism can be envisioned to provide a viable approximation\nto the mathematically more challenging restricted diffusion problems.\n", "  The diffuse cosmic X-ray background (CXB) is the sum of the emission of\ndiscrete sources, mostly massive black-holes accreting matter in active\ngalactic nuclei (AGN). The CXB spectrum differs from the integration of the\nspectra of individual sources, calling for a large population, undetected so\nfar, of strongly obscured Compton thick AGN. Such objects are predicted by\nunified models, which attribute most of the AGN diversity to their inclination\non the line of sight, and play an important role for the understanding of the\ngrowth of black holes in the early Universe. The fraction of obscured AGN at\nlow redshift can be derived from the observed CXB spectrum assuming AGN\nspectral templates and luminosity functions. We show that high signal-to-noise\naverage hard X-ray spectra, derived from more than a billion seconds of\neffective exposure time with the Swift/BAT instrument, imply that mildly\nobscured Compton thin AGN feature a strong reflection and contribute massively\nto the CXB. A population of Compton thick AGN larger than that effectively\ndetected is not required, as no more than 6\\% of the CXB flux can be attributed\nto them. The stronger reflection observed in mildly obscured AGN suggests that\nthe covering fraction of the gas and dust surrounding their central engines is\na key factor in shaping their appearance. These mildly obscured AGN are easier\nto study at high redshift than Compton thick sources.\n", "  We investigate the transmission of both classical and quantum information\nbetween two arbitrary observers in globally hyperbolic spacetimes using a\nquantum field as a communication channel. The field is supposed to be in some\narbitrary quasifree state and no choice of representation of its canonical\ncommutation relations is made. Both sender and receiver possess some localized\ntwo-level quantum system with which they can interact with the quantum field to\nprepare the input and receive the output of the channel, respectively. The\ninteraction between the two-level systems and the quantum field is such that\none can trace out the field degrees of freedom exactly and thus obtain the\nquantum channel in a nonperturbative way. We end the paper determining the\nunassisted as well as the entanglement-assisted classical and quantum channel\ncapacities.\n", "  We present an imaging analysis of four low mass stellar clusters (< 5000 Mo)\nin the outer regions of the LMC in order to shed light on the extended main\nsequence turn-off (eMSTO) phenomenon observed in high mass clusters. The four\nclusters have ages between 1-2 Gyr and two of them appear to host eMTSOs. The\ndiscovery of eMSTOs in such low mass clusters - > 5 times less massive than the\neMSTO clusters previously studied - suggests that mass is not the controlling\nfactor in whether clusters host eMSTOs. Additionally, the narrow extent of the\neMSTO in the two older (~ 2 Gyr) clusters is in agreement with predictions of\nthe stellar rotation scenario, as lower mass stars are expected to be\nmagnetically braked, meaning that their CMDs should be better reproduced by\ncanonical simple stellar populations. We also performed a structural analysis\non all the clusters and found that a large core radius is not a requisite for a\ncluster to exhibit an eMSTO.\n", "  We present a reanalysis of the data from Stanford Linear Accelerator Center\n(SLAC) experiments E140 [R. C. Walker et al., Phys. Rev. D 49, 5671 (1994)] and\nNE11 [L. Andivahis et al., Phys. Rev. D 50, 5491 (1994)] on elastic\nelectron-proton scattering. This work is motivated by recent progress in\ncalculating the corresponding radiative corrections and by the apparent\ndiscrepancy between the Rosenbluth and polarization transfer measurements of\nthe proton electromagnetic form factors. New, corrected values for the\nscattering cross sections are presented, as well as a new form factor fit in\nthe $Q^2$ range from 1 to 8.83 $\\text{GeV}^2$. We also provide a complete set\nof revised formulas to account for radiative corrections in single-arm\nmeasurements of unpolarized elastic electron-proton scattering.\n", "  Detailed investigation of broadband flux variability in the blazar 3C 273\nallows us to probe the location and size of emission regions and their physical\nconditions. We report the results on correlation studies of the flaring\nactivity observed between 2008 and 2012. The observed broadband variations were\ninvestigated using the structure function and the discrete correlation\nfunction, and power spectral density analysis (PSD) methods. The PSD analysis\nshowed that the optical/IR light curve slopes are consistent with the slope of\nwhite noise processes, while, the PSD slopes at radio, X-ray and gamma-ray\nenergies are consistent with red-noise processes. The flux variations at\ngamma-ray and mm-radio bands are found to be significantly correlated. Using\nthe estimated time lag of (110\\pm27) days between gamma-ray and radio light\ncurves, we constrained the location of the gamma-ray emission region at a\nde-projected distance of 1.2\\pm0.9 pc from the jet apex. Flux variations at\nX-ray bands were found to have a significant correlation with variations at\nboth radio and \\gamma-rays energies. The correlation between X-rays and\ngamma-rays light curves suggests presence of two components responsible for the\nX-ray emission. A negative time lag of -(50\\pm20) days, where the X-rays are\nleading the emission, suggests X-rays are emitted closer to the jet apex from a\ncompact region at a distance of ~(0.5\\pm0.4) pc from the jet apex. A positive\ntime lag of (110\\pm20) days suggests jet-base origin of the other X-ray\ncomponent at ~(4--5)~pc from the jet apex. The flux variations at radio\nfrequencies were found to be well correlated with each other such that the\nvariations at higher frequencies are leading the lower frequencies, which could\nbe expected in the standard shock-in-jet model.\n", "  In this PhD Thesis we investigate the geometry of random fields on compact\nRiemannian manifolds, in particular the two-dimensional sphere. In the first\npart, we characterize isotropic Gaussian fields on homogeneous spaces of a\ncompact group and then we prove the non-existence of P. L\\'evy's Brownian field\non the group SO(3), which moreover allows to extend the same kind of result to\nSO(n), SU(n) for n bigger than 3. In the second part, we investigate the\nhigh-energy behavior of random eigenfunctions on the (hyper)sphere and on the\ntorus proving quantitative CLT results for some geometric functionals of those\neiegenfunctions. A nice non-Central and non-Universal result is shown for nodal\nlength distribution in the case of arithmetic random waves. Finally, we extend\nrepresentation formulas obtained in the first part to the case of spin random\nfields on the sphere, introducing a new approach i.e., the pullback random\nfield, that easily allows to study random sections of homogeneous vector\nbundles.\n", "  Planet traps are necessary to prevent forming planets from falling onto their\nhost star by type I migration. Surface mass density and temperature gradient\nirregularities favor the apparition of traps and deserts. Such features are\nfound at the dust sublimation lines and heat transition barriers. We study how\nplanets may remain trapped or escape as they grow and as the disk evolves. We\nmodel the temporal viscous evolution of a protoplanetary disk by coupling its\ndynamics, thermodynamics, geometry and composition. The resulting mid-plane\ndensity and temperature profiles allow the modeling of the interactions of such\nan evolving disk with potential planets, even before the steady state is\nreached. We follow the viscous evolution of a MMSN and compute the Lindblad and\ncorotation torques that such a disk would exert on potential planets of various\nmasses located within the planetary formation region. We determine the position\nof planet traps and deserts in relationship with the sublimation lines,\nshadowed regions and heat transition barriers. Planets that are a few tens of\nEarth masses can be trapped at the sublimation lines until they reach a certain\nmass while planets more massive than 100ME can only be trapped permanently at\nthe heat transition barriers. Coupling a bimodal planetary migration model with\na self-consistent evolved disk, we were able to distinguish several potential\nplanet populations after 5 million years of evolution: two populations of giant\nplanets that could stay trapped around 5.5 and 9 au and possibly open gaps,\nsome super-Earths trapped around 5 and 7.5 au and a population of close-in\nsuper-Earths trapped inside 1 au. The traps corresponding to the last group\ncould help validating the in-situ formation scenarios of the observed close-in\nsuper-Earths.\n", "  An expansion for quantum statistical mechanics is derived that gives\nclassical statistical mechanics as the leading term. Each quantum correction\ncomes from successively larger permutation loops, which arise from the\nfactorization of the symmetrization of the wave function with respect to\nlocalized particle interchange. Explicit application of the theory yields the\nfull fugacity expansion for the quantum ideal gas, and the second fugacity\ncoefficient for interacting quantum particles, which agree with known results.\nCompared to the Lee-Yang virial cluster expansion, the present expansion is\nexpected to be more rapidly converging and the individual terms appear to be\nsimpler to evaluate. The results obtained in this paper are intended for\npractical computer simulation algorithms for terrestrial condensed matter\nquantum systems.\n", "  Biasing or importance sampling is a powerful technique in Monte Carlo\nradiative transfer, and can be applied in different forms to increase the\naccuracy and efficiency of simulations. One of the drawbacks of the use of\nbiasing is the potential introduction of large weight factors. We discuss a\ngeneral strategy, composite biasing, to suppress the appearance of large weight\nfactors. We use this composite biasing approach for two different problems\nfaced by current state-of-the-art Monte Carlo radiative transfer codes: the\ngeneration of photon packages from multiple components, and the penetration of\nradiation through high optical depth barriers. In both cases, the\nimplementation of the relevant algorithms is trivial and does not interfere\nwith any other optimisation techniques. Through simple test models, we\ndemonstrate the general applicability, accuracy and efficiency of the composite\nbiasing approach. In particular, for the penetration of high optical depths,\nthe gain in efficiency is spectacular for the specific problems that we\nconsider: in simulations with composite path length stretching, high accuracy\nresults are obtained even for simulations with modest numbers of photon\npackages, while simulations without biasing cannot reach convergence, even with\na huge number of photon packages.\n", "  Two-dimensional molecular aggregate (2DMA), a thin sheet of strongly\ninteracting dipole molecules self-assembled at close distance on an ordered\nlattice, is a fascinating fluorescent material. It is distinctively different\nfrom the single or colloidal dye molecules or quantum dots in most previous\nresearch. In this paper, we verify for the first time that when a 2DMA is\nplaced at a nanometric distance from a metallic substrate, the strong and\ncoherent interaction between the dipoles inside the 2DMA dominates its\nfluorescent decay at picosecond timescale. Our streak-camera lifetime\nmeasurement and interacting lattice-dipole calculation reveal that the\nmetal-mediated dipole-dipole interaction shortens the fluorescent lifetime to\nabout one half and increases the energy dissipation rate by ten times than\nexpected from the noninteracting single-dipole picture. Our finding can enrich\nour understanding of nanoscale energy transfer in molecular excitonic systems\nand may designate a new direction for developing fast and efficient\noptoelectronic devices.\n", "  We report on the generation of an indistinguishable heralded single-photon\nstate, using highly nondegenerate spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC).\nSpectrally factorable photon pairs can be generated by incorporating a\nbroadband pump pulse and a group-velocity matching (GVM) condition in a\nperiodically-poled potassium titanyl phosphate (PPKTP) crystal. The heralding\nphoton is in the near IR, close to the peak detection efficiency of\noff-the-shelf Si single-photon detectors; meanwhile, the heralded photon is in\nthe telecom L-band where fiber losses are at a minimum. We observe spectral\nfactorability of the SPDC source and consequently high purity (90%) of the\nproduced heralded single photons by several different techniques. Because this\nsource can also realize a high heralding efficiency (> 90%), it would be\nsuitable for time-multiplexing techniques, enabling a pseudo-deterministic\nsingle-photon source, a critical resource for optical quantum information and\ncommunication technology.\n", "  We used narrowband interference filters with the CCD imaging camera on the\nNickel 1.0 meter telescope at Lick Observatory to observe 31 nearby (z < 0.03)\nSeyfert galaxies in the 12 {\\mu}m Active Galaxy Sample. We obtained pure\nemission line images of each galaxy in order to separate H{\\alpha} emission\nfrom the nucleus from that of the host galaxy. The extended H{\\alpha} emission\nis expected to be powered by newly formed hot stars, and correlates well with\nother indicators of current star formation in these galaxies: 7.7 {\\mu}m PAH,\nfar-infrared, and radio luminosity. Relative to what would be expected from\nrecent star formation, there is a 0.8 dex excess of radio emission in our\nSeyfert galaxies. The nuclear H{\\alpha} luminosity is dominated by the AGN, and\nis correlated with the hard X-ray luminosity. There is an upward offset of 1\ndex in this correlation for the Seyfert 1s due to a strong contribution from\nthe Broad Line Region. We found a correlation between star formation rate and\nAGN luminosity. In spite of selection effects, we concluded that the absence of\nbright Seyfert nuclei in galaxies with low SFRs is real, albeit only weakly\nsignificant. We used our measured spatial distributions of H{\\alpha} emission\nto determine what these Seyfert galaxies would look like when observed through\nfixed apertures at high redshifts. Although all would be detectable emission\nline galaxies at any redshift, most would appear dominated by HII region\nemission. Only the most luminous AGN would still be identified at z~0.3.\n", "  We provide a method of designing protocols for implementing multipartite\nquantum measurements when the parties are restricted to local operations and\nclassical communication (LOCC). For each finite integer number of rounds, $r$,\nthe method succeeds in every case for which an $r$-round protocol exists for\nthe measurement under consideration, and failure of the method has the\nimmediate implication that the measurement under consideration cannot be\nimplemented by LOCC no matter how many rounds of communication are allowed,\nincluding when the number of rounds is allowed to be infinite. It turns out\nthat this method shows---often with relative ease---the impossibility by LOCC\nfor a number of examples, including cases where this was not previously known,\nas well as the example that first demonstrated what has famously become known\nas nonlocality without entanglement.\n", "  We observe the radio galaxy PKS 1934-63 (at $z=0.1825$) using MUSE (Multi\nUnit Spectroscopic Explorer) on the Very Large Telescope (VLT). The radio\nsource is GigaHertz Peaked Spectrum and compact (0.13 kpc), implying an early\nstage of evolution ($\\leq 10^4$ yr). Our data show an interacting pair of\ngalaxies, projected separation 9.1 kpc, velocity difference $\\Delta(v)=216$ km\n$\\rm s^{-1}$. The larger galaxy is a $\\rm M_{*}\\simeq 10^{11}M_{\\odot}$\nspheroidal with the emission-line spectrum of a high-excitation young radio\nAGN, e.g. strong [OI]6300 and [OIII]5007. Emission-line ratios indicate a large\ncontribution to the line luminosity from high-velocity shocks ($\\simeq 550$ km\n$\\rm s^{-1}$) . The companion is a non-AGN disk galaxy, with extended $\\rm\nH\\alpha$ emission from which its star-formation rate is estimated as $\\rm\n0.61~M_{\\odot}yr^{-1}$.\n  Both galaxies show rotational velocity gradients in $\\rm H\\alpha$ and other\nlines, with the interaction being prograde-prograde. The SE-NW velocity\ngradient of the AGN host is misaligned from the E-W radio axis, but aligned\nwith a previously discovered central ultraviolet source, and a factor 2 greater\nin amplitude in $\\rm H\\alpha$ than in other (forbidden) lines (e.g.\n[OIII]5007). This could be produced by a fast rotating (100-150 km $\\rm\ns^{-1}$) disk with circumnuclear star-formation. We also identify a broad\ncomponent of [OIII]5007 emission, blueshifted with a velocity gradient aligned\nwith the radio jets, and associated with outflow. However, the broad component\nof [OI]6300 is redshifted. In spectral fits, both galaxies have old stellar\npopulations plus $\\sim 0.1\\%$ of very young stars, consistent with the galaxies\nundergoing first perigalacticon, triggering infall and star-formation from\n$\\sim 40$ Myr ago followed by the radio outburst.\n", "  The nematic ordering in semiflexible polymers with contour length $L$\nexceeding their persistence length $\\ell_p$ is described by a confinement of\nthe polymers in a cylinder of radius $r_{eff}$ much larger than the radius\n$r_\\rho$, expected from the respective concentration of the solution. Large\nscale Molecular Dynamics simulations combined with Density Functional Theory\nare used to locate the Isotropic-Nematic ($I-N$)-transition and to validate\nthis cylindrical confinement. Anomalous fluctuations, due to chain deflections\nfrom neighboring chains in the nematic phase are proposed. Considering\ndeflections as collective excitations in the nematically ordered phase of\nsemiflexible polymers elucidates the origins of shortcomings in the description\nof the $I-N$ transition by existing theories.\n", "  This work aims to identify some inhomogeneity factors for plane symmetric\ntopology with anisotropic and dissipative fluid under the effects of both\nelectromagnetic field as well as Palatini $f(R)$ gravity. We construct the\nmodified field equations, kinematical quantities and mass function to continue\nour analysis. We have explored the dynamical quantities, conservation equations\nand modified Ellis equations with the help of a viable $f(R)$ model. Some\nparticular cases are discussed with and without dissipation to investigate the\ncorresponding inhomogeneity factors. For non-radiating scenario, we examine\nsuch factors with dust, isotropic and anisotropic matter in the presence of\ncharge. For dissipative fluid, we investigate the inhomogeneity factor with\ncharged dust cloud. We conclude that electromagnetic field increases the\ninhomogeneity in matter while the extra curvature terms make the system more\nhomogeneous with the evolution of time.\n", "  Aims. We investigate the feasibility of planetesimal growth in circumbinary\nprotoplanetary disks around the observed systems Kepler- 16 and Kepler-34 under\nthe gravitational influence of a precessing eccentric gas disk. Methods. We\nembed the results of our previous hydrodynamical simulations of protoplanetary\ndisks around binaries into an N-body code to perform 3D, high-resolution,\ninter-particle gravity-enabled simulations of planetesimal growth and dynamics\nthat include the gravitational force imparted by the gas. Results. Including\nthe full, precessing asymmetric gas disk generates high eccentricity orbits for\nplanetesimals orbiting at the edge of the circumbinary cavity, where the gas\nsurface density and eccentricity have their largest values. The gas disk is\nable to efficiently align planetesimal pericenters in some regions leading to\nphased, non-interacting orbits. Outside of these areas eccentric planetesimal\norbits become misaligned and overlap leading to crossing orbits and high\nrelative velocities during planetesimal collisions. This can lead to an\nincrease in the number of erosive collisions that far outweighs the number of\ncollisions that result in growth. Gravitational focusing from the static\naxisymmetric gas disk is weak and does not significantly alter collision\noutcomes from the gas free case. Conclusions. Due to asymmetries in the gas\ndisk, planetesimals are strongly perturbed onto highly eccentric orbits. Where\nplanetesimals orbits are not well aligned, orbit crossings lead to an increase\nin the number of erosive collisions. This makes it difficult for sustained\nplanetesimal accretion to occur at the location of Kepler-16b and Kepler-34b\nand we therefore rule out in-situ growth. This adds further support to our\ninitial suggestions that most circumbinary planets should form further out in\nthe disk and migrate inwards.\n", "  We study L\\'evy flights {{with arbitrary index $0< \\mu \\leq 2$}} inside a\npotential well of infinite depth. Such problem appears in many physical systems\nranging from stochastic interfaces to fracture dynamics and multifractality in\ndisordered quantum systems. The major technical tool is a transformation of the\neigenvalue problem for initial fractional Schr\\\"odinger equation into that for\nFredholm integral equation with hypersingular kernel. The latter equation is\nthen solved by means of expansion over the complete set of orthogonal functions\nin the domain $D$, reducing the problem to the spectrum of a matrix of infinite\ndimensions. The eigenvalues and eigenfunctions are then obtained numerically\nwith some analytical results regarding the structure of the spectrum.\n", "  Observations of small extrasolar planets with a wide range of densities imply\na variety of planetary compositions and structures. Currently, the only\ntechnique to measure the bulk composition of extrasolar planetary systems is\nthe analysis of planetary debris accreting onto white dwarfs, analogous to\nabundance studies of meteorites. We present measurements of the carbon and\noxygen abundances in the debris of planetesimals at ten white dwarfs observed\nwith the Hubble Space Telescope, along with C/O ratios of debris in six systems\nwith previously reported abundances. We find no evidence for carbon-rich\nplanetesimals, with C/O<0.8 by number in all 16 systems. Our results place an\nupper limit on the occurrence of carbon-rich systems at <17 percent with a 2\nsigma confidence level. The range of C/O of the planetesimals is consistent\nwith that found in the Solar System, and appears to follow a bimodal\ndistribution: a group similar to the CI chondrites, with log(<C/O>)=-0.92, and\noxygen-rich objects with C/O less than or equal to that of the bulk Earth. The\nlatter group may have a higher mass fraction of water than the Earth,\nincreasing their relative oxygen abundance.\n", "  Recently, evidence has been presented for the polarization vectors from\nquasars to preferentially align with the axes of the large quasar groups (LQG)\nto which they belong. This report was based on observations made at optical\nwavelengths for two large quasar groups at redshift $\\sim 1.3$. The correlation\nsuggests that the spin axes of quasars preferentially align with their\nsurrounding large-scale structure that is assumed to be traced by the LQGs.\nHere, we consider a large sample of LQGs built from the Sloan Digital Sky\nSurvey DR7 quasar catalogue in the redshift range $1.0-1.8$. For quasars\nembedded in this sample, we collected radio polarization measurements with the\ngoal to study possible correlations between quasar polarization vectors and the\nmajor axis of their host LQGs. Assuming the radio polarization vector is\nperpendicular to the quasar spin axis, we found that the quasar spin axis is\npreferentially parallel to the LQG major axis inside LQGs that have at least\n$20$ members. This result independently supports the observations at optical\nwavelengths. We additionally found that when the richness of an LQG decreases,\nthe quasar spin axis becomes preferentially perpendicular to the LQG major axis\nand that no correlation is detected for quasar groups with fewer than $10$\nmembers.\n", "  India-based Neutrino Observatory (INO) collaboration is planning to build a\nmagnetized Iron-CALorimeter detector (ICAL) for the study of atmospheric\nneutrinos. ICAL detector will be a stack of 151 layers of magnetized iron\nplates interleaved with Resistive Plate Chambers (RPCs) as active detector\nelements with a total mass of 50 kton. Resistive Plate Chambers are gaseous\ndetectors made up of two parallel electrodes of high bulk resistivity like\nfloat glass and bakelite. These detectors are extensively used in several high\nenergy physics experiments since 1980s because of high count rate, excellent\ntime as well as spatial resolutions, simple to fabricate and operate. Due to\ndetector aging issue, it is necessary to characterize electrode material so as\nto select appropriate electrode material before fabricating the detector. In\nthe present studies, we measured bulk resistivity and surface current of glass\nas well as bakelite. Bulk resistivity of bakelite is ~ 100 times less than that\nof glass and surface current of bakelite is higher than that of glass. Also\nglass does not need any kind of surface treatment to achieve better surface\nuniformity. Therefore, glass electrodes are preferred over bakelite electrodes\nin most of the cases. Locally manufactured Asahi glass of ~2 mm thickness and\nbakelite sheets were tested during the studies as reported in this paper before\nthe various stages of detector fabrication.\n", "  We report magnetic field dependent transport measurements on a single crystal\nof cubic YSb together with first principles calculations of its electronic\nstructure. The transverse magnetoresistance does not saturate up to 9 T and\nattains a value of 75,000 % at 1.8 K. The Hall coefficient is electron-like at\nhigh temperature, changes sign to hole-like between 110 and 50 K, and again\nbecomes electron-like below 50 K. First principles calculations show that YSb\nis a compensated semimetal with a qualitatively similar electronic structure to\nthat of isostructural LaSb and LaBi, but with larger Fermi surface volume. The\nmeasured electron carrier density and Hall mobility calculated at 1.8 K, based\non a single band approximation, are 6.5$\\times10^{20}/$cm$^{3}$ and\n6.2$\\times10^{4}$cm$^{2}$/Vs, respectively. These values are comparable with\nthose reported for LaBi and LaSb. Like LaBi and LaSb, YSb undergoes a magnetic\nfield-induced metal-insulator-like transition below a characteristic\ntemperature T$_{m}$, with resistivity saturation below 13 K. Thickness\ndependent electrical resistance measurements show a deviation of the resistance\nbehavior from that expected for a normal metal; however, they do not\nunambiguously establish surface conduction as the mechanism for the resistivity\nplateau.\n", "  A single-wall carbon nanotube possesses two different types of plasmons\nspecified by the wavenumbers in the azimuthal and axial directions. The\nazimuthal plasmon that is caused by interband transitions has been studied,\nwhile the effect of charge doping is unknown. In this paper, we show that when\nnanotubes are heavily doped, intraband transitions cause the azimuthal plasmons\nto appear as a plasmon resonance in the near-infrared region of the absorption\nspectra, which is absent for light doping due to the screening effect. The\naxial plasmons that are inherent in the cylindrical waveguide structures of\nnanotubes, account for the absorption peak of the metallic nanotube observed in\nthe terahertz region. The excitation of axial (azimuthal) plasmons requires a\nlinearly polarized light parallel (perpendicular) to the tube's axis.\n", "  The $1/N$ expansion is an asymptotic series expansion for certain quantities\nin large-$N$ lattice gauge theories. This article gives a rigorous formulation\nand proof of the $1/N$ expansion for Wilson loop expectations in SO(N) lattice\ngauge theory in the strong coupling regime in any dimension. The terms in the\nexpansion are expressed as sums over trajectories of strings in a lattice\nstring theory, establishing an explicit gauge-string duality. The trajectories\ntrace out surfaces of genus zero for the first term in the expansion, and\nsurfaces of higher genus for the higher terms.\n", "  We present an equilibrium statistical-mechanical theory of selectivity in\nbiological ion channels. In doing so, we introduce a grand canonical ensemble\nfor ions in a channel's selectivity filter coupled to internal and external\nbath solutions for a mixture of ions at arbitrary concentrations, we use linear\nresponse theory to find the current through the filter for small gradients of\nelectrochemical potential, and we show that the conductivity of the filter is\ngiven by the generalized Einstein relation. We apply the theory to the\npermeation of ions through the potassium selectivity filter, and are thereby\nable to resolve the long-standing paradox of why the high selectivity of the\nfilter brings no associated delay in permeation. We show that the Eisenman\nselectivity relation follows directly from the condition of diffusion-limited\nconductivity through the filter. We also discuss the effect of wall\nfluctuations on the filter conductivity.\n", "  The rest-frame UV-optical (i.e., NUV-B) color index is sensitive to the\nlow-level recent star formation and dust extinction, but it is insensitive to\nthe metallicity. In this Letter, we have measured the rest-frame NUV-B color\ngradients in ~1400 large ($\\rm r_e>0.18^{\\prime\\prime}$), nearly face-on\n(b/a>0.5) main-sequence star-forming galaxies (SFGs) between redshift 0.5 and\n1.5 in the CANDELS/GOODS-S and UDS fields. With this sample, we study the\norigin of UV-optical color gradients in the SFGs at z~1 and discuss their link\nwith the buildup of stellar mass. We find that the more massive, centrally\ncompact, and more dust extinguished SFGs tend to have statistically more\nnegative raw color gradients (redder centers) than the less massive, centrally\ndiffuse, and less dusty SFGs. After correcting for dust reddening based on\noptical-SED fitting, the color gradients in the low-mass ($M_{\\ast}\n<10^{10}M_{\\odot}$) SFGs generally become quite flat, while most of the\nhigh-mass ($M_{\\ast} > 10^{10.5}M_{\\odot}$) SFGs still retain shallow negative\ncolor gradients. These findings imply that dust reddening is likely the\nprincipal cause of negative color gradients in the low-mass SFGs, while both\nincreased central dust reddening and buildup of compact old bulges are likely\nthe origins of negative color gradients in the high-mass SFGs. These findings\nalso imply that at these redshifts the low-mass SFGs buildup their stellar\nmasses in a self-similar way, while the high-mass SFGs grow inside out.\n", "  Zero-frequency Casimir theory is analyzed from different viewpoints, focusing\non the Drude-plasma issue that turns up when one considers thermal corrections\nto the Casimir force. The problem is that the plasma model, although leaving\nout dissipation in the material, apparently gives the best agreement with\nrecent experiments. We consider a dielectric plate separated from a dielectric\nhalf-space by a vacuum gap, both media being similar. We consider the following\ncategories: (1) Making use of the statistical mechanical method developed by\nH{\\o}ye and Brevik (1998), implying that the quantized electromagnetic field is\nreplaced by interaction between dipole moments oscillating in harmonic\npotentials, we first verify that the Casimir force is in agreement with the\nDrude prediction. No use of Fresnel's reflection coefficients is made at this\nstage. (2) Then turning to the field theoretical description implying use of\nthe reflection coefficients, we derive results in agreement with the forgoing\nwhen first setting the frequency equal to zero, before letting the permittivity\nbecoming large. With the plasma relation the reflection coefficient for TE zero\nfrequency modes depend on the component of the wave vector parallel to the\nsurfaces and lies between 0 and 1. This contradicts basic electrostatic theory.\n(3) Turning to high permeability magnetic materials the TE zero frequency mode\ndescribes the static magnetic field in the same way as the TM zero frequency\nmodes describe the static electric fields in electrostatics. With the plasma\nmodel magnetic fields, except for a small part, can not pass through metals.\ni.e.~metals effectively become superconductors. However, recent experimental\nresults clearly favor the plasma model. We shortly discuss a possible\nexplanation for this apparent conflict with electrostatics.\n", "  The dynamics of short intense electromagnetic pulses propagating in a\nrelativistic pair plasma with small temperature asymmetry is of current\ninterest. Such pulses were shown to be governed by a nonlinear Schrodinger\nequation with a new type of focusing-defocusing nonlinearity. We provide an\nexistence theory and numerical analysis for a special class of solutions, known\nas \"ring-profiled\" optical vortex solitons. Our methods include both a direct\nand constrained minimization. We give a necessary condition for the existence\nof nontrivial solutions and a series of interesting estimates in terms of the\nrelevant parameters describing the electromagnetic pulse. Additionally, we use\nthe constrained minimization approach and a finite element formalism to\nnumerically study the behavior of the profiles of soliton solutions.\n", "  The superconducting parameters and upper critical field of the\nnoncentrosymmetric superconductor BiPd have proven contentious. This material\nis of particular interest because it is a singular example of a\n$4f$-electron-free noncentrosymmetric superconductor of which crystals may be\ngrown and cleaved, enabling surface-sensitive spectroscopies. Here, using bulk\nprobes augmented by tunnelling data on defects, we establish that the lower of\nthe previously reported upper critical fields corresponds to the bulk\ntransition. The material behaves as a nearly-weak-coupled BCS s-wave\nsuperconductor, and we report its superconducting parameters as drawn from the\nbulk upper critical field. Possible reasons behind the order-of-magnitude\ndiscrepancy in the reported upper critical fields are discussed.\n", "  The nonlinear dynamics of a balanced parity-time symmetric optical microring\narrangement are analytically investigated. By considering gain and loss\nsaturation effects, the pertinent conservation laws are explicitly obtained in\nthe Stokes domain-thus establishing integrability. Our analysis indicates the\nexistence of two regimes of oscillatory dynamics and frequency locking, both of\nwhich are analogous to those expected in linear parity-time symmetric systems.\nUnlike other saturable parity time symmetric systems considered before, the\nmodel studied in this work first operates in the symmetric regime and then\nenters the broken parity-time phase.\n", "  The OPERA experiment has reported the detection of five $\\nu_{\\tau}$\ncandidates in the CNGS $\\nu_{\\mu}$ beam, allowing to reject the background-only\nhypothesis at the 5.1$\\sigma$ level. Besides these events, on May 23$^{rd}$\n2011, OPERA detected a \"neutral current like\" interaction with two secondary\nvertices. Such topologies mainly arise from Charged Current interactions of a\n$\\nu_{\\tau}$ with associated charm quark production or from Neutral Current\ninteractions of a $\\nu_{\\mu}$ with production of a charm anti-charm pair. These\ntopologies have generally low probabilities. A dedicated multivariate analysis\nis in progress to allow discriminating between these two hypotheses. Here the\nevent topology is described in detail and preliminary results of the\nclassifiers for all possible contributions are given.\n", "  The atmospheric pressure PECVD deposition and texturization of hydrophobic\ncoatings using liquid fluorinated C6F12 and C6F14 precursors are investigated.\nThe effect of the carrier gas (argon and helium) is discussed in terms of the\nbehavior of the gas phase and of the characteristics of the deposited film.\nMass spectrom-etry measurements indicate that the fragmentation is higher with\nargon while helium reacts very easily with oxygen impurities leading to the\nformation of CxFyOz compounds. These observations are consistent with the\nchemical composition of the films determined by XPS and the variation in the\ndeposition rate. Moreover, the streamers present in the argon discharge affect\nthe morphology of the surface by increasing the roughness, which leads to the\nincrease in the hydrophobicity of the coatings.\n", "  We present the design of an ${}^{90}$Y calibration source and its\nmanufacturing procedure, that has been implemented in the University of Sussex\nradioactive laboratory. The radioactive source was first tested at the\nUniversity of Sussex using a small scintillator cocktail sample. Further\nmeasurements were performed at the University of Pennsylvania using a larger\nvolume of the scintillator cocktail. The results of both studies are presented\nand discussed.\n", "  For the first time, we obtain chemical evolution models (CEMs) for Tucana and\nCetus, two isolated dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) of the Local Group. The\nCEMs have been built from the star formation histories (SFHs) and the\nmetallicity histories, both obtained independently by the LCID project from\ndeep color-magnitude dia- grams. Based on our models, we find that the chemical\nhistories were complex and can be divided into different epochs and scenarios.\nIn particular, during 75 percent of the SFH, the galaxies behaved as closed\nboxes and, during the remaining 25 percent, either received a lot of primordial\ngas by accretion or they lost metals through metal-rich winds. In order to\ndiscriminate between these two scenarios, abundances ratios in old stars are\nneeded. At t approximately 4.5 Gyr, the galaxies lost most of their gas due to\na short-strong, well-mixed wind. We obtain very similar CEMs for both galaxies,\nalthough Cetus is twice as massive as Tucana. We conclude that the star\nformation in both galaxies began with only 1.5 percent of the baryonic mass\nfraction predicted by lambda CDM.\n", "  We present a multi-wavelength study of the low-mass X-ray binary Sco X-1\nusing Kepler K2 optical data and Fermi GBM and MAXI X-ray data. We recover a\nclear sinusoidal orbital modulation from the Kepler data. Optical fluxes are\ndistributed bimodally around the mean orbital light curve, with both high and\nlow states showing the same modulation. The high state is broadly consistent\nwith the flaring branch of the Z diagram and the low state with the normal\nbranch. We see both rapid optical flares and slower dips in the high state, and\nslow brightenings in the low state. High state flares exhibit a narrow range of\namplitudes with a striking cut-off at a maximum amplitude. Optical fluxes\ncorrelate with X-ray fluxes in the high state, but in the low state they are\nanti-correlated. These patterns can be seen clearly in both flux-flux diagrams\nand cross-correlation functions and are consistent between MAXI and GBM. The\nhigh state correlation arises promptly with at most a few minutes lag. We\nattribute this to thermal reprocessing of X-ray flares. The low state\nanti-correlation is broader, consistent with optical lags of between zero and 3\n~min, and strongest with respect to high energy X-rays. We suggest that the\ndecreases in optical flux in the low state may reflect decreasing efficiency of\ndisc irradiation, caused by changes in the illumination geometry. These changes\ncould reflect the vertical extent or covering factor of obscuration or the\noptical depth of scattering material.\n", "  We analyse different types of nonlinear resonances in a weakly damped Duffing\noscillator using bifurcation theory techniques. In addition to (i) odd\nsubharmonic resonances found on the primary branch of symmetric periodic\nsolutions with the forcing frequency and (ii) even subharmonic resonances due\nto symmetry-broken periodic solutions that bifurcate off the primary branch and\nalso oscillate at the forcing frequency, we uncover (iii) novel resonance type\ndue to isolas of periodic solutions that are not connected to the primary\nbranch. These occur between odd and even resonances, oscillate at a fraction of\nthe forcing frequency, and give rise to a complicated resonance `curve' with\ndisconnected elements and high degree of multistability. We use bifurcation\ncontinuation to compute resonance tongues in the plane of the forcing frequency\nvs. the forcing amplitude for different but fixed values of the damping rate.\nIn this way, we demonstrate that identified here isolated resonances explain\nthe intriguing structure of \"patchy tongues\" observed for week damping and link\nit to a seemingly unrelated phenomenon of \"bifurcation superstructure\"\ndescribed for moderate damping.\n", "  The Noether symmetry approach is useful tool to restrict the arbitrariness in\na gravity theory when the equations of motion are underdetermined due to the\nhigh number of functions to be determined in the ansatz. We consider two\nscalar-coupled theories of gravity, one motivated by induced gravity, the other\nmore standard; in Bianchi I, Bianchi III and Kantowski-Sachs cosmological\nmodels. For these models, we present a full set of Noether gauge symmetries,\nwhich are more general than those obtained by the strict Noether symmetry\napproach in our recent work. Some exact solutions are derived using the first\nintegrals corresponding to the obtained Noether gauge symmetries.\n", "  Electronic structures for the conduction bands of both hexagonal and\northorhombic LuFeO3 thin films have been measured using x-ray absorption\nspectroscopy at oxygen K (O K) edge. Dramatic differences in both the spectra\nshape and the linear dichroism are observed. These differences in the spectra\ncan be explained using the differences in crystal field splitting of the metal\n(Fe and Lu) electronic states and the differences in O 2p-Fe 3d and O 2p-Lu 5d\nhybridizations. While the oxidation states has not changed, the spectra are\nsensitive to the changes in the local environments of the Fe3+ and Lu3+ sites\nin the hexagonal and orthorhombic structures. Using the crystal-field splitting\nand the hybridizations that are extracted from the measured electronic\nstructures and the structural distortion information, we derived the\noccupancies of the spin minority states in Fe3+, which are non-zero and uneven.\nThe single ion anisotropy on Fe3+ sites is found to originate from these uneven\noccupancies of the spin minority states via spin-orbit coupling in LuFeO3.\n", "  We investigate the effect of the inclusion of relativistic Coulomb terms in a\nconfined-isospin-density-dependent-mass (CIDDM) model of strange quark matter\n(SQM). We found that if we include Coulomb term in scalar density form, SQM\nequation of state (EOS) at high densities is stiffer but if we include Coulomb\nterm in vector density form is softer than that of standard CIDDM model. We\nalso investigate systematically the role of each term of the extended CIDDM\nmodel. Compared with what was reported in Ref.~\\cite {ref:isospin}, we found\nthe stiffness of SQM EOS is controlled by the interplay among the the\noscillator harmonic, isospin asymmetry and Coulomb contributions depending on\nthe parameter's range of these terms. We have found that the absolute stable\ncondition of SQM and the mass of 2 $M_\\odot$ pulsars can constrain the\nparameter of oscillator harmonic $\\kappa_1$ $\\approx 0.53$ in the case Coulomb\nterm excluded. If the Coulomb term is included, for the models with their\nparameters are consistent with SQM absolute stability condition, the\n$2.0~M_{\\odot}$ constraint more prefer the maximum mass prediction of model\nwith scalar Coulomb term than that of model with vector Coulomb term. On\ncontrary, the high densities EOS predicted by model with vector Coulomb is more\ncompatible with recent pQCD result \\cite{ref:pressure} than that predicted by\nmodel with scalar Coulomb. Furthermore, we also observed the quark composition\nin a very high density region depends quite sensitively on the kind of Coulomb\nterm used.\n", "  We search for hints to the origin and nature of compact stellar systems in\nthe magnitude range of ultracompact dwarf galaxies in deep wide-field imaging\ndata of the Fornax cluster core. We visually investigate a large sample of 355\nspectroscopically confirmed cluster members with V-band equivalent magnitudes\nbrighter than -10 mag for faint extended structures. Our data reveal peculiar\ncompact stellar systems, which appear asymmetric or elongated from their outer\nlight distribution. We characterize the structure of our objects by quantifying\ntheir core concentration, as well as their outer asymmetry and ellipticity. For\nthe brighter objects of our sample we also investigate their spatial and\nphase-space distribution within the cluster. We argue that the distorted outer\nstructure alone that is seen for some of our objects, is not sufficient to\ndecide whether these systems have a star cluster or a galaxy origin. However,\nwe find that objects with low core concentration and high asymmetry (or high\nellipticity) are primarily located at larger cluster-centric distances as\ncompared to the entire sample. This supports the hypothesis that at least some\nof these objects may originate from tidally stripped galaxies.\n", "  We review a method to directly solve the Bethe-Salpeter equation in Minkowski\nspace, both for bound and scattering states. It is based on a proper treatment\nof the many singularities which appear in the kernel and propagators. The\noff-mass shell scattering amplitude for spinless particles interacting by a one\nboson exchange was computed for the first time. Using our Minkowski space\nsolutions for the initial (bound) and final (scattering) states, we calculate\nelastic and transition (bound to scattering state) electromagnetic form\nfactors. The conservation of the transition electromagnetic current J.q=0,\nverified numerically, confirms the validity of our solutions.\n", "  Using archive data from the Millimeter Astronomy Legacy Team Survey at 90 GHz\n(MALT90), carried out using the Mopra 22-m telescope, we made the first\nmulti-transition molecular line study of infrared dark cloud (IRDC) MSXDC\nG331.71+00.59. Two molecular cores were found embedded in this IRDC. Each of\nthese cores is associated with a known extended green object (EGO), indicating\nplaces of massive star formation. The HCO+ (1-0) and HNC (1-0) transitions show\nprominent blue or red asymmetric structures, suggesting outflow and inflow\nactivities of young stellar objects (YSOs). Other detected molecular lines\ninclude H13CO+ (1-0), C2H (1-0), HC3N (10-9), HNCO(404-303) and SiO (2-1),\nwhich are typical of hot cores and outflows. We regard the two EGOs as evolving\nfrom the IRDC to hot cores. Using public GLIMPS data, we investigate the\nspectral energy distribution of EGO G331.71+0.60. Our results support this EGO\nbeing a massive YSO driving the outflow. G331.71+0.58 may be at an earlier\nevolutionary stage.\n", "  Based on a multiwavelength study, the interstellar medium and young stellar\nobjects (YSOs) around the HII region Sh2-82 have been analyzed. Two molecular\nclumps were found from the archival data of the Galactic Ring Survey, and using\nthe Two Micron All-Sky Survey catalog, we found two corresponding young\nclusters embedded in the molecular clumps. The very good relations between CO\nemission, infrared shells and YSOs suggest that it is probably a triggered star\nformation region from the expansion of Sh2-82. We further used the data from\nthe Galactic Legacy Infrared Mid-Plane Survey Extraordinaire from Spitzer to\nstudy the YSOs within the two clumps, confirming star formation in this region.\nBy spectral energy distribution fits to each YSO candidate with infrared\nexcess, we derived the slope of the initial mass function. Finally, comparing\nthe HII region's dynamical age and the fragmentation time of the molecular\nshell, we discard the \"collect and collapse\" process as being the triggering\nmechanism for YSO formation. Sh2-82 can be a mixture of other processes such as\nradiative-driven implosion and/or collisions with pre-existing clumps.\n", "  We discuss the role of quantum fluctuations in Heisenberg antiferromagnets on\nface-centered cubic lattice with small dipolar interaction in which the\nnext-nearest-neighbor exchange coupling dominates over the nearest-neighbor\none. It is well known that a collinear magnetic structure which contains (111)\nferromagnetic planes arranged antiferromagnetically along one of the space\ndiagonals of the cube is stabilized in this model via order-by-disorder\nmechanism. On the mean-field level, the dipolar interaction forces spins to lie\nwithin (111) planes. By considering 1/S - corrections to the ground state\nenergy, we demonstrate that quantum fluctuations lead to an anisotropy within\n(111) planes favoring three equivalent directions for the staggered\nmagnetization (e.g., $[11\\overline{2}]$, $[1\\overline{2}1]$, and\n$[\\overline{2}11]$ directions for (111) plane). Such in-plane anisotropy was\nobtained experimentally in related materials MnO, $\\alpha$-MnS, $\\alpha$-MnSe,\nEuTe, and EuSe. We find that the order-by-disorder mechanism can contribute\nsignificantly to the value of the in-plane anisotropy in EuTe. Magnon spectrum\nis also derived in the first order in 1/S.\n", "  We study the interplay between the global causal and geometric structures of\na spacetime $(M,g)$ and the features of a given smooth $\\mathbb{R}$-action\n$\\rho$ on $M$ whose orbits are all causal curves, building on classic results\nabout Lie group actions on manifolds described by Palais. In the first part of\nthis paper, we prove that $\\rho$ is free and proper (so that $M$ splits\ntopologically) provided that $(M,g)$ is strongly causal and $\\rho$ does not\nhave what we call weakly ancestral pairs, a notion which admits a natural\ninterpretation in terms of \"cosmic censorship\". Accordingly, such condition\nholds automatically if $(M,g)$ is globally hyperbolic. We also prove that $M$\nsplits topologically if $(M,g)$ is strongly causal and $\\rho$ is the flow of a\ncomplete conformal Killing causal vector field. In the second part, we\ninvestigate the class of Brinkmann spacetimes, which can be regarded as null\nanalogues of stationary spacetimes in which $\\rho$ is the flow of a complete\nparallel null vector field. Inspired by the geometric characterization of\nstationary spacetimes in terms of standard stationary ones [24], we obtain an\nanalogous geometric characterization of when a Brinkmann spacetime is isometric\nto a standard Brinkmann spacetime. This result naturally leads us to discuss a\nconjectural null analogue for Ricci-flat $4$-dimensional Brinkmann spacetimes\nof a celebrated rigidity theorem by Anderson [1], and highlight its relation\nwith a long-standing 1962 conjecture by Ehlers and Kundt [13]. If true, our\nconjecture provides strong mathematical support to the idea that gravitational\nplane waves are the most natural \"boundary conditions\" at infinity for vacuum\nsolutions of the Einstein equation modeling regions outside gravitationally\nradiating sources.\n", "  As part of the Chandra Galactic Bulge Survey (GBS), we present a catalogue of\noptical sources in the GBS footprint. This consists of two regions centered at\nGalactic latitude b = 1.5 degrees above and below the Galactic Centre, spanning\n(l x b) = (6x1) degrees. The catalogue consists of 2 or more epochs of\nobservations for each line of sight in r', i' and H{\\alpha} filters. It is\ncomplete down to r' = 20.2 and i' = 19.2 mag; the mean 5{\\sigma} depth is r' =\n22.5 and i' = 21.1 mag. The mean root-mean-square residuals of the astrometric\nsolutions is 0.04 arcsec. We cross-correlate this optical catalogue with the\n1640 unique X-ray sources detected in Chandra observations of the GBS area, and\nfind candidate optical counterparts to 1480 X-ray sources. We use a false alarm\nprobability analysis to estimate the contamination by interlopers, and expect ~\n10 per cent of optical counterparts to be chance alignments. To determine the\nmost likely counterpart for each X-ray source, we compute the likelihood ratio\nfor all optical sources within the 4{\\sigma} X-ray error circle. This analysis\nyields 1480 potential counterparts (~ 90 per cent of the sample). 584\ncounterparts have saturated photometry (r'<17, i'<16), indicating these objects\nare likely foreground sources and the real counterparts. 171 candidate\ncounterparts are detected only in the i'-band. These sources are good qLMXB and\nCV candidates as they are X-ray bright and likely located in the Bulge.\n", "  A model which treats the denatured and the native conformers as being\nconfined to harmonic Gibbs energy wells has been used to analyse the\nnon-Arrhenius behaviour of spontaneously folding fixed two-state systems. The\nresults demonstrate that when pressure and solvent are constant: (i) a\ntwo-state system is physically defined only for a finite temperature range;\n(ii)irrespective of the primary sequence, the 3-dimensional structure of the\nnative conformer, the residual structure in the denatured state, and the\nmagnitude of the folding and unfolding rate constants, the equilibrium\nstability of a two-state system is a maximum when its denatured conformers bury\nthe least amount of solvent accessible surface area (SASA) to reach the\nactivated state; (iii) the Gibbs barriers to folding and unfolding are not\nalways due to the incomplete compensation of the activation enthalpies and\nentropies; (iv) the difference in heat capacity between the reaction-states is\ndue to both the size of the solvent-shell and the noncovalent interactions; (v)\nthe position of the transition state ensemble along the reaction coordinate\n(RC) depends on the choice of the RC; and (vi) the atomic structure of the\ntransiently populated reaction-states cannot be inferred from\nperturbation-induced changes in their energetics.\n", "  In this work we present silicon process compatible, stable and reliable\n($>10^{8}$cycles), high non-linearity ratio at half-read voltage ($>5\\times\n10^{5}$), high speed ($<60ns$) low operating voltage ($<2V$) back-to-back\nSchottky diodes. Materials choice of electrode, thickness of semiconductor\nlayer and doping level are investigated by numerical simulation, experiments\nand current-voltage equations to give a general design consideration when\nback-to-back Schottky diodes are used as selector device for Resistive Random\nAccess Memory(RRAM) arrays.\n", "  A model which treats the denatured and the native conformers as being\nconfined to harmonic Gibbs energy wells has been used to rationalize the\nphysical basis for the non-Arrhenius behaviour of spontaneously-folding fixed\ntwo-state systems. It is shown that at constant pressure and solvent\nconditions: (i) the rate constant for folding will be a maximum when the heat\nreleased upon formation of net molecular interactions is exactly compensated by\nthe heat absorbed to desolvate net polar and non-polar solvent accessible\nsurface area (SASA), as the denatured conformers driven by thermal noise bury\ntheir SASA and diffuse on the Gibbs energy surface to reach the activated\nstate; (ii) the rate constant for unfolding will be a minimum when the heat\nabsorbed by the native conformers to break various net backbone and sidechain\ninteractions is exactly compensated by the heat of hydration released due to\nthe net increase in SASA, as the native conformers unravel to reach the\nactivated state; (iii) the activation entropy for folding will be zero, and the\nGibbs barrier to folding will be a minimum, when the decrease in the backbone\nand the sidechain mobility is exactly compensated by the increase in entropy\ndue to solvent-release, as the denatured conformers bury their SASA to reach\nthe activated state; and (iv) the activation entropy for unfolding will be\nzero, and the Gibbs barrier to unfolding will be a maximum when the increase in\nthe backbone and sidechain mobility is exactly compensated by the negentropy of\nsolvent capture on the protein surface, as the native conformers unravel to\nreach the activated state.\n", "  A model which treats the denatured and native conformers of\nspontaneously-folding fixed two-state systems as being confined to harmonic\nGibbs energy-wells has been developed.Within the assumptions of this model the\nGibbs energy functions of the denatured (DSE) and the native state (NSE)\nensembles are described by parabolas, with the mean length of the reaction\ncoordinate (RC) being given by the temperature-invariant denaturant m\nvalue.Consequently, the ensemble-averaged position of the transition state\nensemble (TSE) along the RC, and the ensemble-averaged Gibbs energy of the TSE\nare determined by the intersection of the DSE and the NSE-parabolas. The\nequations derived enable equilibrium stability and the rate constants to be\nrationalized in terms of the mean and the variance of the Gaussian distribution\nof the solvent accessible surface area of the conformers in the DSE and the\nNSE. The implications of this model for protein folding are discussed.\n", "  Equations that govern the temperature-dependence of the rate constants, Gibbs\nenergies,enthalpies, entropies and heat capacities of activation for folding\nand unfolding of spontaneously-folding fixed two-state systems have been\nderived using a procedure that treats the denatured and the native conformers\nas being confined to harmonic Gibbs energy wells. The notion that a two-state\nsystem is physically defined only for a set temperature range is introduced.\nThe implications of this novel treatment for protein folding are discussed.\n", "  We present the metallicity distribution of a sample of 471 RR Lyrae (RRL)\nstars in the Sculptor dSph, obtained from the $I$-band Period-Luminosity\nrelation. It is the first time that the early chemical evolution of a dwarf\ngalaxy is characterized in such a detailed and quantitative way, using\nphotometric data alone. We find a broad metallicity distribution (FWHM=0.8 dex)\nthat is peaked at [Fe/H]$\\simeq$-1.90 dex, in excellent agreement with\nliterature values obtained from spectroscopic data. Moreover, we are able to\ndirectly trace the metallicity gradient out to a radius of $\\sim$55 arcmin. We\nfind that in the outer regions (r$>\\sim$32 arcmin) the slope of the metallicity\ngradient from the RRLs (-0.025 dex arcmin$^{-1}$) is comparable to the\nliterature values based on red giant (RG) stars. However, in the central part\nof Sculptor we do not observe the latter gradients. This suggests that there is\na more metal-rich and/or younger population in Sculptor that does not produce\nRRLs. This scenario is strengthened by the observation of a metal-rich peak in\nthe metallicity distribution of RG stars by other authors, which is not present\nin the metallicity distribution of the RRLs within the same central area.\n", "  A mini-review devoted to some implications of the Hagedorn temperature for\nblack hole physics. The existence of a limiting temperature is a generic\nfeature of string models. The Hagedorn temperature was introduced first in the\ncontext of hadronic physics. Nowadays, the emphasis is shifted to fundamental\nstrings which might be a necessary ingredient to obtain a consistent theory of\nblack holes. The point is that, in field theory, the local temperature close to\nthe horizon could be arbitrarily high, and this observation is difficult to\nreconcile with the finiteness of the entropy of black holes. After preliminary\nremarks, we review our recent attempt to evaluate the entropy of large black\nholes in terms of fundamental strings. We also speculate on implications for\ndynamics of large-N gauge theories arising within holographic models.\n", "  Direct current (DC) transport and far infrared photoresponse were studied an\nInAs/GaSb double quantum well with an inverted band structure. The DC transport\ndepends systematically upon the DC bias configuration and operating\ntemperature. Surprisingly, it reveals robust edge conduction despite prevalent\nbulk transport in our device of macroscopic size. Under 180 GHz far infrared\nillumination at oblique incidence, we measured a strong photovoltaic response.\nWe conclude that quantum spin Hall edge transport produces the observed\ntransverse photovoltages. Overall, our experimental results support a\nhypothesis that the photoresponse arises from direct coupling of the incident\nradiation field to edge states.\n", "  To evaluate the self-heating effects of FeCo magnetic nanoparticles, the\nsurface oxidized FeCo nanoparticles were synthesized by co-precipitation method\nwith the reduction reaction without any post treatments. As-synthesized FeCo\nnanoparticles exhibited the mean diameter of about 39 nm with the oxidized\nshell thickness of about 4-5 nm. The saturation magnetization and coercivity\nwere obtained 172 emu/g and 268 Oe at 300 K, respectively. The heat elevation\nof the FeCo magnetic colloid was measured under alternating magnetic fields of\n76, 102, and 127 Oe with selectable frequencies of 190, 250 and 355 kHz. The\nheat temperature increased up to about 45 oC from initial temperature of 24 oC\nunder 127 Oe and 355 kHz, which the specific absorption exhibited about 35.7\nW/g.\n", "  It takes years of effort employing the best telescopes and instruments to\nobtain high-quality stellar photometry, astrometry, and spectroscopy. Stellar\nevolution models contain the experience of lifetimes of theoretical\ncalculations and testing. Yet most astronomers fit these valuable models to\nthese precious datasets by eye. We show that a principled Bayesian approach to\nfitting models to stellar data yields substantially more information over a\nrange of stellar astrophysics. We highlight advances in determining the ages of\nstar clusters, mass ratios of binary stars, limitations in the accuracy of\nstellar models, post-main-sequence mass loss, and the ages of individual white\ndwarfs. We also outline a number of unsolved problems that would benefit from\nprincipled Bayesian analyses.\n", "  Two-dimensional (2D) black phosphorus (i.e., phosphorene) has become a rising\nstar in electronics. Recently, 2D phosphorus oxides with higher stability have\nbeen synthesized. In this work, we systematically explore the structures and\nproperties of 2D phosphorus oxides on the basis of global optimization approach\nand first-principles calculations. We find that the structural features of 2D\nphosphorus oxides PxOy vary with the oxygen concentration. When the oxygen\ncontent is poor, the most stable 2D PxOy can be obtained by adsorbing O atoms\non phosphorene. However, when the oxygen concentration becomes rich, stable\nstructures are no longer based on phosphorene and will contain P-O-P motifs.\nFor the 2D P4O4, we find that it has a direct band gap (about 2.24 eV), good\noptical absorption, and high stability in water, suggesting that it may be good\ncandidate for photochemical water splitting application. Interestingly, 2D P2O3\nadopt two possible stable ferroelectric structures (P2O3-I and P2O3-II) as the\nlowest energy configurations within a given layer thickness. The electric\npolarizations of P2O3-I and P2O3-II are perpendicular and parallel to the\nlateral plane, respectively. We propose that 2D P2O3 could be used in a novel\nnanoscale multiple-state memory device. Our work suggests that 2D phosphorus\noxides may be excellent functional materials.\n", "  We introduce energy-preserving integrators for nonholonomic mechanical\nsystems. We will see that the nonholonomic dynamics is completely determined by\na triple $({\\mathcal D}^*, \\Pi, \\mathcal{H})$, where ${\\mathcal D}^*$ is the\ndual of the vector bundle determined by the nonholonomic constraints, $\\Pi$ is\nan almost-Poisson bracket (the nonholonomic bracket) and $\\mathcal{H}:{\\mathcal\nD}^{*}\\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ is a Hamiltonian function. For this triple, we\ncan apply energy-preserving integrators, in particular, we show that discrete\ngradients can be used in the numerical integration of nonholonomic dynamics. By\nconstruction, we achieve preservation of the constraints and of the energy of\nthe nonholonomic system. Moreover, to facilitate their applicability to complex\nsystems which cannot be easily transformed into the aforementioned\nalmost-Poisson form, we rewrite our integrators using just the initial\ninformation of the nonholonomic system. The derived procedures are tested on\nseveral examples: A chaotic quartic nonholonomic mechanical system, the\nChaplygin sleigh system, the Suslov problem and a continuous gearbox driven by\nan asymmetric pendulum. Their performace is compared with other standard\nmethods in nonholonomic dynamics, and their merits verified in practice.\n", "  From a non-equilibrium thermodynamical framework for transport analysis based\non Onsager's Regression Hypothesis, we derive the value function first\ndescribed by Dirac for isotope separation. This application of the framework is\ninterpreted as both further validation of the transport framework and as a\ngeneralization of Dirac's value function. The framework for the analysis of\ntransport phenomena is introduced, first. From the entropy of mixing, and in\nthe presence of gradients in thermodynamic potentials, this framework generates\na dynamical transport model from which Dirac's value function is derived as a\nmeasure of separative work performed. Dirac's value function is thus shown to\nbe a measure of separative work for systems that are described by the entropy\nof mixing. As a further demonstration of its generality, the result is applied\nto a two-quantity, single spatial-dimension spin magnetization system.\n", "  It is well-known that the Heisenberg-Euler-Schwinger effective Lagrangian\npredicts that a vacuum with a strong static electromagnetic field turns\nbirefringent. We propose a scheme that can be implemented at the planned\nFCC-ee, to measure the nonlinear effect of vacuum birefringence in\nelectrodynamics arising from QED corrections. Our scheme employs a pulsed laser\nto create Compton backscattered photons off a high energy electron beam, with\nthe FCC-ee as a particularly interesting example. These photons will pass\nthrough a strong static magnetic field, which changes the state of polarization\nof the radiation - an effect proportional to the photon energy. This change\nwill be measured by the use of an aligned single-crystal, where a large\ndifference in the pair production cross-sections can be achieved. In the\nproposed experimental setup the birefringence effect gives rise to a difference\nin the number of pairs created in the analyzing crystal, stemming from the fact\nthat the initial laser light has a varying state of polarization, achieved with\na rotating quarter wave plate. Evidence for the vacuum birefringent effect will\nbe seen as a distinct peak in the Fourier transform spectrum of the\npair-production rate signal. This tell-tale signal can be significantly above\nbackground with only few hours of measurement, in particular at high energies.\n", "  In many extensions of the Standard Model, the alignment in flavor space of\nthe fermion mass matrices and the Yukawa coupling matrices can be broken. The\nphysical scalar boson $h(125)$ could then have flavor changing couplings. In\nthis talk, we summarize constraints on such couplings from rare decay searches,\nand we investigate current and future detection prospects at the LHC. We\nemphasize the importance of several yet unexplored final states: (i) anomalous\nsingle top + $h$ production in $p p \\to t h$, arising from $tuh$ couplings (but\nnot from the more widely studied $tch$ couplings); (ii) $p p \\to t + (H^0 \\to h\nh)$ through $tuh$ couplings in the context of a Two Higgs Doublet Model (2HDM),\nperhaps the simplest model with flavor violation in the scalar sector; (iii) $p\np \\to H^0 \\to \\tau\\mu$ in the 2HDM context. For all of these processes, we\nperform a detailed phenomenological studies. Finally, we comment on the\npossibility of flavor violation combined with CP violation, which may be\ninteresting if the current CMS hint for $h \\to \\tau\\mu$ gets corroborated.\n", "  The Micro-Pattern Gaseous Detectors offer excellent spatial and temporal\nresolution in harsh radiation environments of high-luminosity colliders. In\nthis work, an attempt has been made to establish an algorithm for estimating\nthe time resolution of different MPGDs. It has been estimated numerically on\nthe basis of two aspects, statistics and distribution of primary electrons and\ntheir diffusion in gas medium, while ignoring their multiplication. The effect\nof detector design parameters, field configuration and the composition of gas\nmixture on the resolution have also been investigated. Finally, a modification\nin the numerical approach considering the threshold limit of detecting the\nsignal has been done and tested for the RPC detector for its future\nimplementation in case of MPGDs.\n", "  Micromegas detector is considered to be a promising candidate for a large\nvariety of high-rate experiments. Micromegas of various geometries have already\nbeen established as appropriate for these experiments for their performances in\nterms of gas gain uniformity, energy and space point resolution, and their\ncapability to efficiently pave large read-out surfaces with minimum dead zone.\nThe present work investigates the effect of spacers on different detector\ncharacteristics of Micromegas detectors having various amplification gaps and\nmesh hole pitches. Numerical simulation has been used as a tool of exploration\nto evaluate the effect of such dielectric material on detector performance.\nSome of the important and fundamental characteristics such as electron\ntransparency, gain and signal of the Micromegas detector have been estimated.\n", "  Based on the Taylor expansion, we propose a renormalization method for\nasymptotic analysis. The standard renormalization group (RG) method for\nasymptotic analysis can be derived out from this new method, and hence the\nmathematical essence of the RG method is also recovered. The biggest advantage\nof the proposed method is that the secular terms in perturbation series are\nautomatically eliminated, but in usual perturbation theory, we need more\nefforts and tricks to eliminate these terms. At the same time, the mathematical\nfoundation of the method is simple and the logic of the method is very clear,\ntherefore, it is very easy in practice. As application, we obtain the uniform\nvalid asymptotic solutions to some problems including vector field, boundary\nlayer and boundary value problems of nonlinear wave equations. Moreover, we\ndiscuss the normal form theory and reduction equations of dynamical systems.\nFurthermore, by combining the topological deformation and the RG method, a\nmodified method namely the homotopy renormalization method (for simplicity,\nHTR) wasproposed to overcome the weaknesses of the standard RG method. In this\nHTR method, since there is a freedom to choose the first order approximate\nsolution in perturbation expansion, we can improve the global solution. In\nparticular, for those equations including no a small parameter, the HTR method\ncan also be applied. Some concrete applications including multi-solutions\nproblems, the forced Duffing equation and the Blasius equation are given.\n", "  The operation of gas detectors is often limited by secondary effects,\noriginating from avalanche-induced photons and ions. Ion backflow is one of the\neffects limiting the operation of a gas detector at high flux, by giving rise\nto space charge which disturbs the electric field locally. For the Micromegas\ndetector, a large fraction of the secondary positive ions created in the\navalanche can be stopped at the micro-mesh. The present work involves\nmeasurements of the ion backflow fraction (using an experimental setup\ncomprising of two drift planes) in bulk Micromegas detectors as a function of\ndetector design parameters. These measured characteristics have also been\ncompared in detail to numerical simulations using the Garfield framework that\ncombines packages such as neBEM, Magboltz and Heed. Further, the effect of\nusing a second micro-mesh on ion backflow and other parameters has been studied\nnumerically.\n", "  The present work involves the comparison of various bulk Micromegas detectors\nhaving different design parameters. Six detectors with amplification gaps of\n$64,~128,~192,~220 ~\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ and mesh hole pitch of $63,~78\n~\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ were tested at room temperature and normal gas pressure. Two\nsetups were built to evaluate the effect of the variation of the amplification\ngap and mesh hole pitch on different detector characteristics. The gain, energy\nresolution and electron transmission of these Micromegas detectors were\nmeasured in Argon-Isobutane (90:10) gas mixture while the measurements of the\nion backflow were carried out in P10 gas. These measured characteristics have\nbeen compared in detail to the numerical simulations using the Garfield\nframework that combines packages such as neBEM, Magboltz and Heed.\n", "  Several experiments observed deviations from the Standard Model (SM) in the\nflavour sector: LHCb found a $4-5\\,\\sigma$ discrepancy compared to the SM in\n$b\\to s\\mu^+\\mu^-$ transitions (recently supported by an Belle analysis) and\nCMS reported a non-zero measurement of $h\\to\\mu\\tau$ with a significance of\n$2.4\\,\\sigma$. Furthermore, BELLE, BABAR and LHCb founds hints for the\nviolation of flavour universality in $B\\to D^{(*)}\\tau\\nu$. In addition, there\nis the long-standing discrepancy in the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon.\nInterestingly, all these anomalies are related to muons and taus, while the\ncorresponding electron channels seem to be SM like. This suggests that these\ndeviations from the SM might be correlated and we briefly review some selected\nmodels providing simultaneous explanations.\n", "  Recently, numerous approaches have emerged in the social sciences to exploit\nthe opportunities made possible by the vast amounts of data generated by online\nsocial networks (OSNs). Having access to information about users on such a\nscale opens up a range of possibilities, all without the limitations associated\nwith often slow and expensive paper-based polls. A question that remains to be\nsatisfactorily addressed, however, is how demography is represented in the OSN\ncontent? Here, we study language use in the US using a corpus of text compiled\nfrom over half a billion geo-tagged messages from the online microblogging\nplatform Twitter. Our intention is to reveal the most important spatial\npatterns in language use in an unsupervised manner and relate them to\ndemographics. Our approach is based on Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) augmented\nwith the Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA) methodology. We find\nspatially correlated patterns that can be interpreted based on the words\nassociated with them. The main language features can be related to slang use,\nurbanization, travel, religion and ethnicity, the patterns of which are shown\nto correlate plausibly with traditional census data. Our findings thus validate\nthe concept of demography being represented in OSN language use and show that\nthe traits observed are inherently present in the word frequencies without any\nprevious assumptions about the dataset. Thus, they could form the basis of\nfurther research focusing on the evaluation of demographic data estimation from\nother big data sources, or on the dynamical processes that result in the\npatterns found here.\n", "  Computers have profoundly changed the way scientific research is done.\nWhereas the importance of computers as research tools is evident to everyone,\nthe impact of the digital revolution on the representation of scientific\nknowledge is not yet widely recognized. An ever increasing part of today's\nscientific knowledge is expressed, published, and archived exclusively in the\nform of software and electronic datasets. In this essay, I compare these\ndigital scientific notations to the the traditional scientific notations that\nhave been used for centuries, showing how the digital notations optimized for\ncomputerized processing are often an obstacle to scientific communication and\nto creative work by human scientists. I analyze the causes and propose\nguidelines for the design of more human-friendly digital scientific notations.\n", "  Observations of the neutral Hydrogen (\\HI ) 21-cm signal hold the potential\nof allowing us to map out the cosmological large scale structures (LSS) across\nthe entire post-reionization era ($z \\leq 6$). Several experiments are planned\nto map the LSS over a large range of redshifts and angular scales, many of\nthese targeting the Baryon Acoustic Oscillations. It is important to model the\n\\HI distribution in order to correctly predict the expected signal, and more so\nto correctly interpret the results after the signal is detected. In this paper\nwe have carried out semi-numerical simulations to model the \\HI distribution\nand study the \\HI power spectrum $P_{\\HI}(k,z)$ across the redshift range $1\n\\le z \\le 6$. We have modelled the \\HI bias as a complex quantity\n$\\tilde{b}(k,z)$ whose modulus squared $b^2(k,z)$ relates $P_{\\HI}(k,z)$ to the\nmatter power spectrum $P(k,z)$, and whose real part $b_r(k,z)$ quantifies the\ncross-correlation between the \\HI and the matter distribution. We study the $z$\nand $k$ dependence of the bias, and present polynomial fits which can be used\nto predict the bias across $0 \\le z \\le6$ and $0.01 \\le k \\le 10 \\, {\\rm\nMpc}^{-1}$. We also present results for the stochasticity $r=b_r/b$ which is\nimportant for cross-correlation studies.\n", "  Using the signal eigenvectors and components analyser (Grunskaya L.V.,\nIsakevich V.V., Isakevich D.V. the RF Utility Model Patent 116242 of\n30.09.2011) made it possible to detect non-coherent complex-period components\nlocalized at lunar tide frequencies in the time-series of the electric field\nvertical component of the Earth atmosphere boundary layer. The detected\ncomponents are unobservable by means of spectral analysis quadrature scheme.\nThe probability of the detected effects being pseudo-estimates is not more than\n0.00025\n", "  An inadvertent or unwanted angular deviation to a passing beam can be\nintroduced by any single optical component within an optical system. The\nproblem arises due to an imperfect tilt alignment of the optical component or\nmanufacturing defects which results in a slightly different response than\nexpected from an ideally aligned/manufactured component. The resulting beam\ndeviation can plague any well-designed optical system that assumes the use of\nideal components. The problem is especially introduced by non-ideal lenses,\ntransparent plates and optical windows. Here we present a simple method of\nmanually introducing a deviation error angle which we assume to be constant for\nall beam incidence angles over the paraxial range.\n", "  We report on the bright burst detected by four Interplanetary network (IPN)\nspacecraft on 2015 April 12. The IPN localization of the source is consistent\nwith the position of the recently discovered soft gamma-repeater SGR 1935+2154.\nFrom the Konus-Wind (KW) observation, we derive temporal and spectral\nparameters of the emission, and the burst energetics. The rather long duration\nof the burst ($\\sim$1.7 s) and the large measured energy fluence\n($\\sim2.5\\times10^{-5}$ erg cm$^{-2}$) put it in the class of rare\n\"intermediate\" SGR flares, and this is the first one observed from SGR\n1935+2154. A search for quasi-periodic oscillations in the KW light curve\nyields no statistically significant signal. Of four spectral models tested,\noptically thin thermal bremsstrahlung and a single blackbody (BB) function can\nbe rejected on statistical grounds; two more complex models, a cutoff power law\n(CPL) and a sum of two BB functions (2BB), fit the burst spectra well and\nneither of them may be ruled out by the KW observation. The CPL and 2BB model\nparameters we report for this bright flare are typical of SGRs; they are also\nconsistent with those obtained from observations of much weaker and shorter SGR\n1935+2154 bursts with other instruments. From the distribution of double\nblackbody spectral fit parameters we estimate the SGR 1935+2154 distance to be\n$<$10.0 kpc, in agreement with that of the Galactic supernova remnant G57.2+0.8\nat 9.1 kpc.\n", "  In this reply we discuss definition and estimation of the Fisher exponent in\nthe no-enclaves percolation (NEP) model.\n", "  A solute-blocking model is presented that provides a kinetic explanation of\nosmosis and ideal solution thermodynamics. It validates a diffusive model of\nosmosis that is distinct from the traditional convective flow model of osmosis.\nOsmotic equilibrium occurs when the fraction of water molecules in solution\nmatches the fraction of pure water molecules that have enough energy to\novercome the pressure difference. Solute-blocking also provides a kinetic\nexplanation for why Raoult's law and the other colligative properties depend on\nthe mole fraction (but not the size) of the solute particles, resulting in a\nnovel kinetic explanation for the entropy of mixing and chemical potential of\nideal solutions. Some of its novel predictions have been confirmed, others can\nbe tested experimentally or by simulation.\n", "  We observe large, reversible, bias driven changes in the vibrational energies\nof PCBM, based on simultaneous transport and surface-enhanced Raman\nspectroscopy (SERS) measurements on PCBM-gold junctions. A combination of\nlinear and quadratic shifts in vibrational energies with voltage is analyzed\nand compared with similar measurements involving C60-gold junctions. A\ntheoretical model based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations\nsuggests that both a vibrational Stark effect and bias-induced charging of the\njunction contribute to the shifts in vibrational energies. In the PCBM case, a\nlinear vibrational Stark effect is observed due to the permanent electric\ndipole moment of PCBM. The vibrational Stark shifts shown here for PCBM\njunctions are comparable to or larger than the charging effects that dominate\nin C60 junctions.\n", "  Although the Cassini Spacecraft and the Huygens lander provided numerous\ninformation about Titan atmospheric chemistry and the formation of its\naerosols, the exact composition of these aerosols still remains unknown. A\nfruitful proxy to investigate these aerosols is the use of laboratory\nexperiments that allow producing and studying analogs of Titan aerosol, the\nso35 called tholins. Even when produced in the laboratory, unveiling the exact\ncomposition of the aerosol remains problematic due to the high complexity of\nthe material. Numerous advances have been recently made using high-resolution\nmass spectrometry (HRMS) (Pernot et al. 2010, Somogyi et al. 2012, Gautier et\nal. 2014) that allowed the separation of isobaric compounds and a robust\nidentification of chemical species composing tholins regarding their molecular\nformulae. Nevertheless isomeric species cannot be resolved by a simple mass\nmeasurement. We propose here an analysis of tholins by high performance liquid\nchromatography (HPLC) coupled to HRMS to unveil this isomeric ambiguity for\nsome of the major tholins compounds. By comparing chromatograms obtained when\nanalyzing tholins and chemical standards, we strictly identified seven\nmolecules in our tholins samples: melamine, cyanoguanidine,\n6-methyl-1,3,5-triazine-2,4-diamine, 2,4,6-triaminopyrimidine, 3-amino-\n1,2,4-triazole, 3,5-Dimethyl-1,2,4-triazole and 2,4-diamino-1,3,5-triazine.\nSeveral molecules, including hexamethylenetriamine (HMT) were not present at\ndetectable levels in our sample. The use for the first time of a coupled\nHPLC-HRMS technique applied to tholins study demonstrated the interest of such\na technique compared to single high-resolution mass spectrometry for the study\nof tholins composition.\n", "  This study presents the first observation of shear wave induced remotely\nwithin soft tissues. It was performed through the combination of a transcranial\nmagnetic stimulation device and a permanent magnet. A physical model based on\nMaxwell and Navier equations was developed. Experiments were performed on a\ncryogel phantom and a chicken breast sample. Using an ultrafast ultrasound\nscanner, shear waves of respective amplitude of 5 and 0.5 micrometers were\nobserved. Experimental and numerical results were in good agreement. This study\nconstitutes the framework of an alternative shear wave elastography method.\n", "  We have conducted a feasibility study to determine the effectiveness of using\nUSNO-B1.0 data to preferentially detect objects with displaced red and blue\ncomponents. A procedure was developed to search catalogue entries for such\nobjects, which include M dwarfs paired with white dwarfs or with earlier\nmain-sequence stars, and galaxies with asymmetric colour distributions.\nResidual differences between red and blue and infrared and blue scanned\nemulsion images define vectors, which, when appropriately aligned and of\nsufficient length, signal potential candidates. Test sample sets were analysed\nto evaluate the effective discrimination of the technique. Over 91,000\nUSNO-B1.0 catalogue entries at points throughout the celestial sphere were then\nfiltered for acceptable combinations of entry observations and magnitudes and\nthe resulting total of about 17,000 entries was winnowed down to a little more\nthan 200 objects of interest. These were screened by visual examination of\nphoto images to a final total of 146 candidates. About one quarter of these\ncandidates coincide with SDSS data. Those constituents fall into two groups,\nsingle and paired objects. SDSS identified several galaxies in the first group.\nRegarding the second group, at least half of its members were tentatively\nidentified as main-sequence pairs, the greater portion being of widely\nseparated spectral types. Two white dwarf--main-sequence pairs were also\nidentified. Most importantly, the vectors formed from USNO-B1.0 residuals were\nin alignment with corresponding SDSS pair position angles, thereby supporting\nthis work`s central thesis.\n", "  Solvable structures are exploited in order to find families of explicit\nsolutions to evolution PDEs admitting suitable differential constraints. The\neffectiveness of the method is verified on several explicit examples.\n", "  A recent \"beam splitting\" experiment at LCLS apparently demonstrated that\nafter a microbunched electron beam is kicked on a large angle compared to the\ndivergence of the FEL radiation, the microbunching wave front is readjusted\nalong the new direction of motion of the kicked beam. Therefore, coherent\nradiation from an undulator placed after the kicker is emitted along the kicked\ndirection without suppression. This strong emission of coherent undulator\nradiation in the kicked direction cannot be explained in the framework of\nconventional synchrotron radiation theory. In a previous paper we explained\nthis puzzle. We demonstrated that, in accelerator physics, the coupling of\nfields and particles is based, on the one hand, on the use of results from\nparticle dynamics treated according to the absolute time convention and, on the\nother hand, on the use of Maxwell equations treated according to the standard\n(Einstein) synchronization convention. Here lies the misconception which led to\nthe strong qualitative disagreement between theory and experiment. After the\n\"beam splitting\" experiment at LCLS, it became clear that the conventional\ntheory of synchrotron radiation cannot ensure the correct description of\ncoherent and spontaneous emission from a kicked electron beam, nor the emission\nfrom a beam with finite angular divergence, in an undulator or a bending\nmagnet. However, this result requires further experimental confirmation. In\nthis publication we propose an uncomplicated and inexpensive experiment to test\nsynchrotron radiation theory at 3rd generation light sources.\n", "  The memory kernel for a tagged particle in a fluid, computed from molecular\ndynamics simulations, decays algebraically as $t^{-3/2}$. We show how the\nhydrodynamic Basset-Boussinesq force naturally emerges from this long-time tail\nand generalize the concept of hydrodynamic added mass. This mass term is\nnegative in the present case of a molecular solute, at odds with incompressible\nhydrodynamics predictions. We finally discuss the various contributions to the\nfriction, the associated time scales and the cross-over between the molecular\nand hydrodynamic regimes upon increasing the solute radius.\n", "  We measured a change in the current transport of an antenna-coupled,\nmulti-gate, GaAs/AlGaAs field-effect transistor when terahertz electromagnetic\nwaves irradiated the transistor and attribute the change to bolometric heating\nof the electrons in the two-dimensional electron channel. The observed\nterahertz absorption spectrum indicates coherence between plasmons excited\nunder adjacent biased device gates. The experimental results agree\nquantitatively with a theoretical model we developed that is based on a\ngeneralized plasmonic transmission line formalism and describes an evolution of\nthe plasmonic spectrum with increasing electron density modulation from\nhomogeneous to the crystal limit. These results demonstrate an electronically\ninduced and dynamically tunable plasmonic band structure.\n", "  We present an updated EDM effective electric field of $E_{\\text{eff}} =\n75.2\\left[\\frac{\\rm GV}{\\rm cm}\\right]$ and the electron-nucleon\nscalar-pseudoscalar interaction constant $W_S=107.8$ [kHz] for the\n${^3\\Delta}_1$ science state of ThO. The criticisms made in reference [J. Chem.\nPhys. 142, 024301 (2015)] are addressed and largely found to be unsubstantiated\nwithin the framework of our approach.\n", "  Photonic crystals and metamaterials have emerged as two classes of tailorable\nmaterials that enable precise control of light. Plasmonic crystals, which can\nbe thought of as photonic crystals fabricated from plasmonic materials, Bragg\nscatter incident electromagnetic waves from a repeated unit cell. However,\nplasmonic crystals, like metamaterials, are composed of subwavelength unit\ncells. Here, we study terahertz plasmonic crystals of several periods in a two\ndimensional electron gas. This plasmonic medium is both extremely subwavelength\n($\\approx \\lambda/100$) and reconfigurable through the application of voltages\nto metal electrodes. Weakly localized crystal surface states known as Tamm\nstates are observed. By introducing an independently controlled plasmonic\ndefect that interacts with the Tamm states, we demonstrate a frequency agile\nelectromagnetically induced transparency phenomenon. The observed 50% ${\\it\nin-situ}$ tuning of the plasmonic crystal band edges should be realizable in\nmaterials such as graphene to actively control the plasmonic crystal dispersion\nin the infrared.\n", "  In category theory, logic and geometry cooperate with each other producing\nwhat is known under the name Synthetic Differential Geometry (SDG). The main\ndifference between SDG and standard differential geometry is that the\nintuitionistic logic of SDG enforces the existence of infinitesimal objects\nwhich essentially modify the local structure of spaces considered in SDG. We\nfocus on an \"infinitesimal version\" of SDG, an infinitesimal $n$-dimensional\nformal manifold, and develop differential geometry on it. In particular, we\nshow that the Riemann curvature tensor on infinitesimal level is itself\ninfinitesimal. We construct a heuristic model $S^3 \\times \\mathbb{R} \\subset\n\\mathbb{R}^4$ and study it from two perspectives: the perspective of the\ncategory SET and that of the so-called topos $\\mathcal{G}$ of germ-determined\nideals. We show that the fact that in this model the curvature tensor is\ninfinitesimal (in $\\mathcal{G}$-perspective) eliminates the existing\nsingularity. A surprising effect is that the hybrid geometry based on the\nexistence of the infinitesimal and the SET levels generates an exotic smooth\nstructure on $\\mathbb{R}^4$. We briefly discuss the obtained results and\nindicate their possible applications.\n", "  We present an electrically tunable terahertz two dimensional plasmonic\ninterferometer with an integrated detection element that down converts the\nterahertz fields to a DC signal. The integrated detector utilizes a resonant\nplasmonic homodyne mixing mechanism that measures the component of the plasma\nwaves in-phase with an excitation field functioning as the local oscillator.\nPlasmonic interferometers with two independently tuned paths are studied. These\ndevices demonstrate a means for developing a spectrometer-on-a-chip where the\ntuning of electrical length plays a role analogous to that of physical path\nlength in macroscopic Fourier transform interferometers.\n", "  A Schottky diode integrated into a terahertz quantum cascade laser waveguide\ncouples directly to the internal laser fields. In a multimode laser, the diode\nresponse is correlated with both the instantaneous power and the coupling\nstrength to the diode of each lasing mode. Measurements of the rectified\nresponse of diodes integrated in two quantum cascade laser cavities at\ndifferent locations indicate that the relative diode position strongly\ninfluences the laser-diode coupling.\n", "  Filopodia are ubiquitous fingerlike protrusions, spawned by many eukaryotic\ncells, to probe and interact with their environments. Polymerization dynamics\nof actin filaments, comprising the structural core of filopodia, largely\ndetermine their instantaneous lengths and overall lifetimes. The polymerization\nreactions at the filopodial tip require transport of G-actin, which enter the\nfilopodial tube from the filopodial base and diffuse toward the filament barbed\nends near the tip. Actin filaments are mechanically coupled into a tight bundle\nby cross-linker proteins. Interestingly, many of these proteins are relatively\nshort, restricting the free diffusion of cytosolic G-actin throughout the\nbundle and, in particular, its penetration into the bundle core. To investigate\nthe effect of steric restrictions on G-actin diffusion by the porous structure\nof filopodial actin filament bundle, we used a particle-based stochastic\nsimulation approach. We discovered that excluded volume interactions result in\npartial and then full collapse of central filaments in the bundle, leading to a\nhollowed-out structure. The latter may further collapse radially due to the\nactivity of cross-linking proteins, hence producing conical-shaped filament\nbundles. Interestingly, electron microscopy experiments on mature filopodia\nindeed frequently reveal actin bundles that are narrow at the tip and wider at\nthe base. Overall, our work demonstrates that excluded volume effects in the\ncontext of reaction-diffusion processes in porous networks may lead to\nunexpected geometric growth patterns and complicated, history-dependent\ndynamics of intermediate metastable configurations.\n", "  We characterized the DC transport response of a diode embedded in a THz\nquantum cascade laser as the laser current was changed. The overall response is\ndescribed by parallel contributions from the rectification of the laser field\ndue to the non-linearity of the diode I-V and from thermally activated\ntransport. Sudden jumps in the diode response when the laser changes from\nsingle mode to multi-mode operation, with no corresponding jumps in output\npower, suggest that the coupling between the diode and laser field depends on\nthe spatial distribution of internal fields. The results demonstrate\nconclusively that the internal laser field couples directly to the integrated\ndiode.\n", "  In the present paper, the decision problem of the Schr\\\"odinger equation\n(asking whether or not a given Hamiltonian operator has the nonempty solution\nset) is represented as a logical statement. As it is shown in the paper, the\nlaw of excluded middle would be applicable to the introduced statement if and\nonly if quantum fundamentalism (asserting that everything in the universe is\nultimately describable in quantum-mechanical terms) held. But, since the\ndecision problem of the Schr\\\"odinger equation is in general undecidable, such\na statement is allowed to be other than true or false, explicitly, it may fail\nto have truth values at all. This makes possible to abandon the law of excluded\nmiddle together with quantum fundamentalism in the proposed intuitionistic\ninterpretation of quantum mechanics.\n", "  The device applications of plasmonic systems such as graphene and two\ndimensional electron gases (2DEGs) in III-V heterostructures include terahertz\ndetectors, mixers, oscillators and modulators. These two dimensional (2D)\nplasmonic systems are not only well-suited for device integration, but also\nenable the broad tunability of underdamped plasma excitations via an applied\nelectric field. We present demonstrations of the coherent coupling of multiple\nvoltage tuned GaAs/AlGaAs 2D plasmonic resonators under terahertz irradiation.\nBy utilizing a plasmonic homodyne mixing mechanism to downconvert the near\nfield of plasma waves to a DC signal, we directly detect the spectrum of\ncoupled plasmonic micro-resonator structures at cryogenic temperatures. The\n2DEG in the studied devices can be interpreted as a plasmonic waveguide where\nmultiple gate terminals control the 2DEG kinetic inductance. When the gate\ntuning of the 2DEG is spatially periodic, a one-dimensional finite plasmonic\ncrystal forms. This results in a subwavelength structure, much like a\nmetamaterial element, that nonetheless Bragg scatters plasma waves from a\nrepeated crystal unit cell. A 50% in situ tuning of the plasmonic crystal band\nedges is observed. By introducing gate-controlled defects or simply terminating\nthe lattice, localized states arise in the plasmonic crystal. Inherent\nasymmetries at the finite crystal boundaries produce an induced\ntransparency-like phenomenon due to the coupling of defect modes and crystal\nsurface states known as Tamm states. The demonstrated active control of coupled\nplasmonic resonators opens previously unexplored avenues for sensitive direct\nand heterodyne THz detection, planar metamaterials, and slow-light devices.\n", "  Many control applications can be formulated as optimization constrained by\nconservation laws. Such optimization can be efficiently solved by\ngradient-based methods, where the gradient is obtained through the adjoint\nmethod. Traditionally, the adjoint method has not been able to be implemented\nin \"gray-box\" conservation law simulations. In gray-box simulations, the\nanalytical and numerical form of the conservation law is unknown, but the\nspace-time solution of relevant flow quantities is available. Without the\nadjoint gradient, optimization can be challenging for problems with many\ncontrol variables. However, much information about the gray-box simulation is\ncontained in its space-time solution, which motivates us to estimate the\nadjoint gradient by leveraging the space-time solution. This article considers\na type of gray-box simulations where the flux function is partially unknown. A\nmethod is introduced to estimate the adjoint gradient at a cost independent of\nthe number of control variables. The method firstly infers a conservation law,\nnamed the twin model, from the space-time solution, and then applies the\nadjoint method to the inferred twin model to estimate the gradient. The method\nis demonstrated to achieve good gradient estimation accuracies in several\nnumerical examples. The main contributions of this paper are: a twin model\nmethod that enables the adjoint gradient computation for gray-box conservation\nlaw simulations; and an adaptive basis construction scheme that fully exploits\nthe information of gray-box solutions.\n", "  We present numerical results of supercontinuum (SC) generation in the mid-IR\nspectral region, specifically addressing the molecular fingerprint window\nranging from 2.5 to 25 um. By solving the Generalized Nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger\nEquation (GNLSE) in a chalcogenide waveguide, we demonstrate low-power SC\ngeneration beyond 10 um from a pump at 5 um. Further, we investigate the\nshort-pulse and CW regimes, and show that a simple linear dispersion profile,\napplicable to a broad range of chalcogenide media, is sufficient to account for\nthe broad SC generation, and yield rich pulse dynamics leading to the frequent\noccurrence of rogue wave events. Results are encouraging as they point to the\nfeasibility of producing bright and coherent light, by means of single\nlow-power tabletop laser pumping schemes, in a spectral region that finds\napplications in such diverse areas as molecular spectroscopy, metrology and\ntomography, among others, and that is not easily addressable with other light\nsources\n", "  Cold ions sliding across periodic potential patterns formed by lasers\nelucidate the physics of dry friction between crystals. Experiments with no\nmore than six ions suffice to explore a vast domain of frictional forces.\n", "  In this work the accuracy of the Actuator Line Model (ALM) in Large Eddy\nSimulations of wind turbine flow is studied under the specific conditions of\nvery coarse spatial resolutions. For finely-resolved conditions, it is known\nthat ALM provides better accuracy compared to the standard Actuator Disk Model\n(ADM) without rotation. However, we show here that on very coarse resolutions,\nflow induction occurring at rotor scales can affect the predicted inflow angle\nand can adversely affect the ALM predictions. We first provide an illustration\nof coarse LES to reproduce wind tunnel measurements. The resulting flow\npredictions are good, but the challenges in predicting power outputs from the\ndetailed ALM motivate more detailed analysis on a case with uniform inflow. We\npresent a theoretical framework to compare the filtered quantities that enter\nthe Large-Eddy Simulation equations as body forces with a scaling relation\nbetween the filtered and unfiltered quantities. The study aims to apply the\ntheoretical derivation to the simulation framework and improve the current\nresults for an ALM, especially in the near wake where the largest differences\nare observed.\n", "  If the cosmological limits on the sum of the neutrino masses are taken\nseriously we have first measurements of the masses of the neutrinos. Using the\nPlanck experiment's limit $\\sum_{i=1}^3{m_i} < 230 ~meV$ and some simple\nassumptions on measurement uncertainties the mass of the heaviest neutrino is\n$63\\pm11 ~meV$ and the lightest $40\\pm18 ~meV$ for either hierarchy.\n", "  We consider the kinematics of the locally BPS super-Wilson loop in\n$\\mathcal{N}=4$ super-Yang-Mills with scalar coupling from a twistorial point\nof view. We find that the kinematics can be described either as\nsupersymmetrized pure spinors or as a point in $G_{2\\vert 2}(4\\vert 4) \\times\nG_{2\\vert 2}(4\\vert 4)$. In this description of the kinematics the\nscalar--scalar correlation function appearing in the one-loop evaluation of the\nsuper-Wilson loop can be neatly written as a sum of four super-determinants.\n", "  In this PhD thesis we review some aspects of integrable models related to\nstring backgrounds or their deformations. In the first part we develop methods\nto obtain exact results in the AdS3/CFT2 correspondence. We consider the AdS_3\nx S^3 x T^4 background with pure Ramond-Ramond flux and we find the all-loop\nworldsheet S-matrix by exploiting the symmetries of the model in light-cone\ngauge. As we naturally include the massless modes on the worldsheet, we derive\nthe full set of Bethe-Yang equations. In the massive sector we give also a\nspin-chain description and we write down solutions compatible with crossing for\nthe scalar factors which are not constrained by simmetries. In the second part\nof the thesis we consider the so-called \"eta-deformation\" of the superstring on\nAdS_5 x S^5. We first discuss the effects of the deformation at the level of\nthe bosonic sigma-model, and we match the tree-level worldsheet scattering\nprocesses to the expansion of the q-deformed S-matrix. To identify the missing\nRamond-Ramond fields we then compute the action quadratic in fermions, and we\nprovide an alternative derivation by looking at the kappa-symmetry variations.\nThe resulting background fields do not solve the equations of motion of type\nIIB supergravity and we comment on this.\n", "  We introduce and study the \"kicked Hall system\" (KHS), i.e., charged\nparticles periodically kicked in the presence of uniform magnetic\n($\\mathbf{B}$) and electric ($\\mathbf{E}$) fields that are perpendicular to\neach other and to the kicking direction. We show that for resonant values of\n$B$ and $E$ and in the weak-chaos regime of sufficiently small nonintegrability\nparameter $\\kappa$ (the kicking strength), there exists a \\emph{generic} family\nof periodic kicking potentials for which the Hall effect from $\\mathbf{B}$ and\n$\\mathbf{E}$ significantly suppresses the weak chaos, replacing it by\n\\emph{\"superweak\"} chaos (SWC). This means that the system behaves as if the\nkicking strength were $\\kappa ^2$ rather than $\\kappa$. For $E=0$, SWC is known\nto be a classical fingerprint of quantum antiresonance but it occurs under much\nless generic conditions, in particular only for very special kicking\npotentials. Manifestations of SWC are a decrease in the instability of periodic\norbits and a narrowing of the chaotic layers, relative to the ordinary\nweak-chaos case. Also, for global SWC, taking place on an infinite \"stochastic\nweb\" in phase space, the chaotic diffusion on the web is much slower than the\nweak-chaos one. Thus, the Hall effect can be relatively stabilizing for small\n$\\kappa$. In some special cases, the effect is shown to cause ballistic motion\nfor almost all parameter values. The generic global SWC on stochastic webs in\nthe KHS appears to be the two-dimensional closest analog to the Arnol'd web in\nhigher dimensional systems.\n", "  In electron positron annihilation, changing quarks into the final hadron\nstates is being described by fragmentation function. Based on the scaling\nhypothesis, this function will be independent from the center of mass energy.\nGluon radiation violates the scaling feature. Transverse momentum distribution\nplays an important role in scaling violation of fragmentation functions. In\nthis article, by the use of data resulted from the annihilation process of\nelectron positron in AMY detector at 60 GeV center of mass energy, first,\ncharged particles multiplicity distribution will be obtained and it will be\nfitted with the KNO scaling. Furthermore, momentum spectra of charged particles\nand momentum distribution respect to the jet axis will be obtained. Then, the\nresults will be compared regarding the different models of QCD; as well, the\ndistribution of fragmentation functions and scaling violations will be studied.\nIt is being expected that the scaling violations of the fragmentation functions\nof gluon jet are stronger to the quark one. One of the reasons for such case is\nthat splitting function of jet is larger than splitting function of gluon.\n", "  We briefly review our results on the Lie theory underlying vector bundles\nover Lie groupoids and Lie algebroids, pointing out the role of Poisson\ngeometry in extending these results to double Lie algebroids and LA-groupoids.\n", "  The behavior of quenched Dirac spectra of two-dimensional lattice QCD is\nconsistent with spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking which is forbidden\naccording to the Coleman-Mermin-Wagner theorem. One possible resolution of this\nparadox is that, because of the bosonic determinant in the partially quenched\npartition function, the conditions of this theorem are violated allowing for\nspontaneous symmetry breaking in two dimensions or less. This goes back to work\nby Niedermaier and Seiler on nonamenable symmetries of the hyperbolic spin\nchain and earlier work by two of the auhtors on bosonic partition functions at\nnonzero chemical potential. In this talk we discuss chiral symmetry breaking\nfor the bosonic partition function of QCD at nonzero isospin chemical potential\nand a bosonic random matrix theory at imaginary chemical potential and compare\nthe results with the fermionic counterpart. In both cases the chiral symmetry\ngroup of the bosonic partition function is noncompact.\n", "  Fluid dispersed two-dimensional (2D) composite materials with dynamically\ntunable functional properties have recently emerged as a novel highly promising\nclass of optoelectronic materials, opening up new routes not only for the\nemerging field of metamaterials but also to chip-scale multifunctional\nmetadevices. However, in-situ monitoring and detection of the dynamic ordering\nof 2D nanoparticles on chip and during the device operation is still a huge\nchallenge. Here we introduce a novel approach for on-chip, in-situ Raman\ncharacterisation of 2D-fluid composite materials incorporated into Si photonics\nchip. In this work the Raman signal for 2D nanoplatelets is selectively\nenhanced by Fabry-Perot resonator design of CMOS photonic-compatible\nmicrofluidic channels. This has then been extended to demonstrate the first\nin-situ Raman detection of the dynamics of individual 2D nanoplatelets, within\na microfluidic channel. Our work paves the way for the first practicable\nrealisation of 3D photonic microstructure shaping based on 2D-fluid composites\nand CMOS photonics platform.\n", "  We present the results of a photometry campaign of TU Com performed over a\nfive-year time span. The analysis showed that the possible Blazhko period of 75\ndays published by the General Catalogue of Variable Stars is not correct. We\nidentified two Blazhko periods of 43.6 and 45.5 days. This finding is based on\nmeasurement of 124 light maxima. A spectral analysis of the complete light\ncurve confirmed these two periods. Besides the Blazhko amplitude and phase\nmodulations, another long term periodic phase variation has been identified.\nThis long term periodic variation affects the times of maximum light only and\ncan be attributed to a light-travel time effect due to orbital motion of a\nbinary system. The orbital parameters have been estimated by a nonlinear\nleast-square fit applied to the set of (O-C) values. The Levenberg-Marquart\nalgorithm has been used to perform the nonlinear least-square fit. The\ntentative orbital parameters include an orbital period of 1676 days, a minimal\nsemi-major axis of 1.55 AU and a small eccentricity of 0.22. The orbital\nparameter estimation also used 33 (O-C) values obtained from the SWASP survey\ndatabase. Spectroscopic radial velocity measurements are needed to confirm this\nbinarity. If confirmed, TU Com would be the first Blazhko RR Lyrae star\ndetected in a binary system.\n", "  It has recently been shown that a parametrically driven oscillator with Kerr\nnonlinearity yields a Schr\\\"odinger cat state via quantum adiabatic evolution\nthrough its bifurcation point and a network of such nonlinear oscillators can\nbe used for solving combinatorial optimization problems by bifurcation-based\nadiabatic quantum computation [H. Goto, Sci. Rep. \\textbf{6}, 21686 (2016)].\nHere we theoretically show that such a nonlinear oscillator network with\ncontrollable parameters can also be used for universal quantum computation. The\ninitialization is achieved by a quantum-mechanical bifurcation based on quantum\nadiabatic evolution, which yields a Schr\\\"odinger cat state. All the elementary\nquantum gates are also achieved by quantum adiabatic evolution, in which\ndynamical phases accompanying the adiabatic evolutions are controlled by the\nsystem parameters. Numerical simulation results indicate that high gate\nfidelities can be achieved, where no dissipation is assumed.\n", "  A two dimensional (2D) Group-VI Te monolayer, tellurene, is predicted by\nusing the first-principles calculations, which consists of planner\nfour-membered and chair-like six-membered rings arranged alternately in a 2D\nlattice. The phonon spectra calculations, combined with ab initio molecular\ndynamics (MD) simulations, demonstrate that tellurene is kinetically very\nstable. The tellurene shows a desirable direct band gap of 1.04 eV and its band\nstructure can be effectively tuned by strain. The effective mass calculations\nimply that tellurene should also exhibit a relatively high carrier mobility,\ne.g. compared with MoS2. The significant direct band gap and the high carrier\nmobility imply that tellurene is a very promising candidate for a new\ngeneration of nanoelectronic devices.\n", "  Kepler-78 is host to a transiting 8.5-hour orbit super-Earth. In this paper,\nthe rotation and magnetic properties of the planet host star are studied. We\nfirst revisit the Kepler photometric data for a detailed description of the\nrotation properties of Kepler-78, showing that the star seems to undergo a\ncycle in the spot pattern of ~1,300 day duration. We then use\nspectropolarimetric observations with CFHT/ESPaDOnS to measure the circular\npolarization in the line profile of the star during its rotation cycle, as well\nas spectroscopic proxies of the chromospheric activity. The average field has\nan amplitude of 16 G. The magnetic topology is characterized by a poloidal and\na toroidal component, encompassing 60% and 40% of the magnetic energy,\nrespectively. Differential rotation is detected with an estimated rate of\n0.105+-0.039 rad/d. Activity tracers vary with the rotation cycle of the star;\nthere is no hint that a residual activity level is related to the planetary\norbit at the precision of our data. The description of the star magnetic\nfield's characteristics then may serve as input for models of interactions\nbetween the star and its close-by planet, e.g., Ohmic dissipation and unipolar\ninduction.\n", "  First steps are taken in a project to construct a general class of conformal\nand perhaps, eventually, non-conformal quantum field theories of\n(n-1)-dimensional extended objects in a d=2n dimensional conformal space-time\nmanifold M. The fields live on the spaces E of relative integral (n-1)-cycles\nin M -- the integral (n-1)-currents of given boundary. Each E is a complete\nmetric space geometrically analogous to a Riemann surface $\\Sigma$. For\nexample, if $M=S^d$, $\\Sigma = S^2$. The quantum fields on E are to be mapped\nto observables in a 2d CFT on $\\Sigma$. The correlation functions on E are to\nbe given by the 2d correlation functions on $\\Sigma$. The goal is to construct\na CFT of extended objects in d=2n dimensions for every 2d CFT, and eventually a\nnon-conformal QFT of extended objects for every non-conformal 2d QFT, so that\nall the technology of 2d QFT can be applied to the construction and analysis of\nquantum field theories of extended objects. The project depends crucially on\nsettling some mathematical questions about analysis in the spaces E. The\nproject also depends on extending the observables of 2d CFT from the finite\nsets of points in a Riemann surface to the integral 0-currents.\n", "  We report the observation of carrier mediated decrease in the stiffness of\ncrystalline (c)-Si(100) under nanoindentation. The apparent elastic modulii of\nheavily dopes (1E21 cm-3) p- and n-type c-Si are observed to be lower by 5.-7.5\npercent that the estimated value for intrinsic (1E14 cm-3) c-Si. The deviation\nobserved with respect to elastic modulus remarkably matches with the estimated\nvalue while considering the electronic elastic strain effect on carrier\nconcentration as an influence of negative pressure coefficient of band gap for\nSi. The value is predominantly higher than the reported value of a decrease of\n1-3 percent in stiffness as an effect of impurity in c-Si.\n", "  The electrical and photodiode characteristics of ensemble and single p-GaN\nnanowire and n-Si heterojunction devices were studied. Ideality factor of the\nsingle nanowire p-GaN/n-Si device was found to be about three times lower\ncompared to that of the ensemble nanowire device. Apart from the deep-level\ntraps in p-GaN nanowires, defect states due to inhomogeneity in Mg dopants in\nthe ensemble nanowire device are attributed to the origin of high ideality\nfactor. Photovoltaic mode of ensemble nanowire device showed an improvement in\nthe fill-factors up to 60 percent over the single nanowire device with\nfill-factors up to 30 percent. Reponsivity of the single nanowire device in\nphotoconducting mode was found to be enhanced by five orders, at 470 nm. The\nenhanced photoresponse of the single nanowire device also confirms the\nphotoconduction due to defect states in p-GaN nanowires.\n", "  The physicochemical processes at the surfaces of semiconductor nanostructures\ninvolved in electrochemical and sensing devices are strongly influenced by the\npresence of intrinsic or extrinsic defects. To reveal the surface controlled\nsensing mechanism, intentional lattice oxygen defects are created on the\nsurfaces of GaN nanowires for the elucidation of charge transfer process in\nmethane (CH4) sensing. Experimental and simulation results of electron energy\nloss spectroscopy (EELS) studies on oxygen rich GaN nanowires confirmed the\npossible presence of 2(ON) and VGa-3ON defect complexes. A global resistive\nresponse for sensor devices of ensemble nanowires and a localized charge\ntransfer process in single GaN nanowires are studied in situ scanning by Kelvin\nprobe microscopy (SKPM). A localized charge transfer process, involving the\nVGa-3ON defect complex on nanowire surface is attributed in controlling the\nglobal gas sensing behavior of the oxygen rich ensemble GaN nanowires.\n", "  The localized effect of impurities in single GaN nanowires in the\nsub-diffraction limit is reported using the study of lattice vibrational modes\nin the evanescent field of Au nanoparticle assisted tip enhanced Raman\nspectroscopy (TERS). GaN nanowires with the O impurity and the Mg dopants were\ngrown by the chemical vapor deposition technique in the catalyst assisted\nvapor-liquid-solid process. Symmetry allowed Raman modes of wurtzite GaN are\nobserved for undoped and doped nanowires. Unusually very strong intensity of\nthe non-zone center zone boundary mode is observed for the TERS studies of both\nthe undoped and the Mg doped GaN single nanowires. Surface optical mode of A1\nsymmetry is also observed for both the undoped and the Mg doped GaN samples. A\nstrong coupling of longitudinal optical (LO) phonons with free electrons,\nhowever is reported only in the O rich single nanowires with the asymmetric\nA1(LO) mode. Study of the local vibration mode shows the presence of Mg as\ndopant in the single GaN nanowires.\n", "  We review the concept of a graded bundle as a natural generalisation of a\nvector bundle. Such geometries are particularly nice examples of more general\ngraded manifolds. With hindsight there are many examples of graded bundles that\nappear in the existing literature. We start with a discussion of graded spaces,\npassing through graded bundles and their linearisation to end with weighted\n(graded) Lie groupoids/algebroids.\n", "  I report on the Stawell Underground Physics Laboratory (SUPL), a new facility\nto be built in 2016, located 1 km below the surface in western Victoria,\nAustralia. I will discuss the status of the proposed SABRE experiment, which\nwill be comprised of a pair of high purity 50-60 kg NaI crystal detectors with\nactive veto shielding to be located in labs in the Northern and Southern\nHemispheres respectively. I also discuss projects beyond SABRE, including\ndirectional dark matter detectors, which will be used to determine the origin\nof any true dark matter signals.\n", "  We show, for the first time, that ${\\rm H_2}$ formation on dust grains can be\nenhanced in disk galaxies under strong ram-pressure (RP). We numerically\ninvestigate how the time evolution, of ${\\rm H}$ {\\sc i} and ${\\rm H_2}$\ncomponents in disk galaxies orbiting a group/cluster of galaxies, can be\ninfluenced by hydrodynamical interaction between the gaseous components of the\ngalaxies and the hot intra-cluster medium (ICM). We find that compression of\n${\\rm H}$ {\\sc i} caused by RP increases ${\\rm H_2}$ formation in disk\ngalaxies, before RP rapidly strips ${\\rm H}$ {\\sc i}, cutting off the fuel\nsupply and causing a drop in ${\\rm H_2}$ density. We also find that the level\nof this ${\\rm H_2}$ formation enhancement in a disk galaxy under RP depends on\nthe mass of its host cluster dark matter (DM) halo, initial positions and\nvelocities of the disk galaxy, and disk inclination angle with respect to the\norbital plane. We demonstrate that dust growth is a key factor in the evolution\nof the ${\\rm H}$ {\\sc i} and ${\\rm H_2}$ mass in disk galaxies under strong RP.\nWe discuss how the correlation between ${\\rm H_2}$ fractions and surface gas\ndensities of disk galaxies evolves with time in the galaxies under RP. We also\ndiscuss whether or not galaxy-wide star formation rates (SFRs) in cluster disk\ngalaxies can be enhanced by RP if the SFRs depend on ${\\rm H_2}$ densities.\n", "  The polarized Raman spectroscopy is capable of giving confirmation regarding\nthe crystalline phase as well as the crystallographic orientation of the\nsample. In this context, apart from crystallographic x-ray and electron\ndiffraction tools, polarized Raman spectroscopy and corresponding spectral\nimaging can be a promising crystallographic tool for determining both\ncrystalline phase and orientation. Sub-micron sized hexagonal AlGaN\ncrystallites are grown by a simple atmospheric pressure chemical vapor\ndeposition technique using the self catalytic vapor-solid process under N-rich\ncondition. The crystallites are used for the polarized Raman spectra in\ndifferent crystalline orientations along with spectral imaging studies. The\nresults obtained from the polarized Raman spectral studies shows single\ncrystalline nature of sub-micron sized hexagonal AlGaN crystallites. Optical\nproperties of the crystallites for different crystalline orientations are also\nstudied using polarized photoluminescence measurements. The influence of\ninternal crystal field to the photoluminescence spectra is proposed to explain\nthe distinctive observation of splitting of emission intensity reported, for\nthe first time, in case of c-plane oriented single crystalline AlGaN\ncrystallite as compared to that of m-plane oriented crystallite.\n", "  Metal oxide nanostructures are widely used in energy applications like super\ncapacitors and Li-on battery. Smaller size nanocrystals show better stability,\nlow ion diffusion time, higher-ion flux and low pulverization than bigger size\nnanocrystals during electrochemical operation. Studying the distinct properties\nof smaller size nanocrystals such as quantum dots (QDs) can improve the\nunderstanding on reasons behind the better performance and it will also help in\nusing QDs or smaller size nanoparticles (NPs) more efficiently in different\napplications. Aqua stable pure SnO2 QDs with compositional stability and high\nsurface to volume ratio are studied as an electrochemical super capacitor\nmaterial and compared with bigger size NPs of size 25 nm. Electron energy-loss\nspectroscopic study of the QDs revealed dominant role of surface over the bulk.\nTemperature dependent study of low frequency Raman mode and defect Raman mode\nof QDs indicated no apparent volume change in the SnO2 QDs within the\ntemperature range of 80-300 K. The specific capacitance of these high surface\narea and stable SnO2 QDs has showed only 9% loss while increasing the scan rate\nfrom 20 mV/S to 500 mV/S. Capacitance loss for the QDs is less than 2% after\n1000 cycles of charging discharging, whereas for the 25 nm SnO2 NPs, the\ncapacitance loss is 8% after 1000 cycles. Availability of excess open volume in\nQDs leading to no change in volume during the electro-chemical operation and\ngood aqua stability is attributed to the better performance of QDs over bigger\nsized NPs.\n", "  In this paper we provide an accurate high-pressure structural and optical\nstudy of MAPbI3 hybrid perovskite. Structural data show the presence of a phase\ntransition towards an orthorhombic structure around 0.3 GPa followed by full\namorphization of the system above 3 GPa. After releasing pressure the systems\nkeeps the high-pressure orthorhombic phase. The occurrence of these structural\ntransitions is further confirmed by pressure induced variations of the\nphotoluminescence signal at high pressure. These variations clearly indicate\nthat the bandgap value and the electronic structure of MAPI change across the\nphase transition.\n", "  The large magnetocaloric effect (MCE), which accompanies the first order\nferromagnetic/anti-ferromagnetic transition in CsCl-ordered Fe-Rh alloys, has\nbeen investigated by measurements in slowly cycled magnetic fields of up to 2 T\nin magnitude for a range of temperatures, 300K < T < 350K. A bulk sample with\ncomposition Fe(50.4)Rh(49.6) was used and the results were compared with those\nproduced by the ab-initio density functional theory-based disordered local\nmoment (DLM) theory of the MCE. The measurements revealed an irreversibility\neffect in which the temperature of the material did not return to its initial\nvalue following several cycles of the magnetic field. These observations were\nexplained in the framework of the ab-initio theory for the first order\ntransition in which the consequences of the incomplete long range compositional\norder and small compositional inhomogeneities of the sample were included. The\nmean value of the long range order parameter S used in the theoretical work was\n0.985, close to the value obtained experimentally from XRD measurements. The\nsample inhomogeneities were modeled by regions in the sample having a\ndistribution of S values with narrow half-width 0.004 about the mean value. The\ninfluence of such compositional disorder on both the transition temperature\n(323.5 K) and MCE adiabatic temperature change (delT = 7.5 K) was also studied.\n", "  For the first time, high optical quality InN films were grown on sapphire\nsubstrate using atmospheric chemical vapour deposition technique in the\ntemperature range of 560-650 oC. Self-catalytic approach was adopted to\novercome the nucleation barrier for depositing InN films. In this process,\nseeding of the nucleation sites and subsequent growth was performed in the\npresence of reactive NH3. We investigated the simultaneous effect of strain and\nBurstein-Moss (BM) energy shift on optical properties of InN films using Raman\nand photoluminescence spectroscopy. Existence of compressive strain in all\nfilms is revealed by Raman spectroscopic analysis and is found to relax with\nincreasing growth temperature. The asymmetric broadening of the A1(LO) phonon\nmode is observed with the onset of plasmon-phonon interaction for films grown\nat 620 oC. Large blue shift of the band gap of InN (1.2 eV) is observed as a\ncollective result of compressive strain in films as well as BM shift. Carrier\ndensity is calculated using the BM shift in the photoluminescence spectra.\nFinally, blue shift in band edge emission is observed further because of the\npresence of compressive strain in the films along with the BM effect.\n", "  The sliding of three-dimensional clusters and two-dimensional islands\nadsorbed on crystal surfaces represent an important test case to understand\nfriction. Even for the same material, monoatomic islands and thick clusters\nwill not as a rule exhibit the same friction, but specific differences have not\nbeen explored. Through realistic molecular dynamics simulations of the static\nfriction gold on graphite, an experimentally relevant system, we uncover as a\nfunction of gold thickness a progressive drop of static friction from monolayer\nislands, that are easily pinned, towards clusters, that slide more readily. The\nmain ingredient contributing to this thickness-induced lubricity appears to be\nthe increased effective rigidity of the atomic contact, acting to reduce the\ncluster interdigitation with the substrate. A second element which plays a role\nis lateral contact size, which can accommodate the solitons typical of the\nincommensurate interface only above a critical contact diameter, which is\nlarger for monolayer islands than for thick clusters. The two effects concur to\nmake clusters more lubric than islands, and large sizes more lubric than\nsmaller ones. These conclusions are expected to be of broader applicability in\ndiverse nanotribological systems, where the role played by static, and dynamic,\nfriction is generally quite important.\n", "  Presently, the piezoelectric materials are finding tremendous applications in\nthe micro-mechanical actuators, sensors and self-powered devices. In this\ncontext, the studies pertaining to piezoelectric properties of materials in the\ndifferent size ranges are very important for the scientific community. The\nIII-nitrides are exceptionally important, not only for optoelectronic but also\nfor their piezoelectric applications. In the present study, we synthesized\nAlGaN via self catalytic vapor-solid mechanism by atmospheric pressure chemical\nvapor deposition technique on AlN base layer over intrinsic Si(100) substrate.\nThe growth process is substantiated using X-ray diffraction and X-ray\nphotoelectron spectroscopy. The Raman and photoluminescence study reveal the\nformation of AlGaN microrods in the wurtzite phase and ensures the high optical\nquality of the crystalline material. The single crystalline, direct wide band\ngap and hexagonally shaped AlGaN microrods are studied for understanding the\nbehavior of the crystallites under the application of constant external\nelectric field using the piezoresponse force microscopy. The present study is\nmainly focused on understanding the behavior of induced polarization for the\ndetermination of piezoelectric coefficient of AlGaN microrod along the c-axis\nand imaging of piezoelectric domains in the sample originating because of the\nangular inclination of AlGaN microrods with respect to its AlN base layers.\n", "  We report on the observation of the quantum Hall effect at high temperatures\nin HgTe quantum wells with a finite band gap and a thickness below and above\nthe critical thickness $d_\\textnormal{c}$ that separates a conventional\nsemiconductor from a two-dimensional topological insulator. At high carrier\nconcentrations we observe a quantized Hall conductivity up to 60\\,K with energy\ngaps between Landau Levels of the order of 25\\,meV, in good agreement with the\nLandau Level spectrum obtained from $\\mathbf{k\\cdot p}$-calculations. Using the\nscaling approach for the plateau-plateau transition at $\\nu=2\\rightarrow 1$, we\nfind the scaling coefficient $\\kappa =0.45 \\pm 0.04$ to be consistent with the\nuniversality of scaling theory and we do not find signs of increased\nelectron-phonon interaction to alter the scaling even at these elevated\ntemperatures. Comparing the high temperature limit of the quantized Hall\nresistance in HgTe quantum wells with a finite band gap with room temperature\nexperiment in graphene, we find the energy gaps at the break-down of the\nquantization to exceed the thermal energy by the same order of magnitude.\n", "  Solutions of the Schr\\\"odinger equation by spanning the wave function is a\ncomplete basis is a common practice is many-body interacting systems. We shall\nstudy the case of a two-dimensional quantum system composed by two interacting\nspin-less electrons and see that the correctness of the matrix approach depends\ninexplicably on the type of interaction existing between particles.\n", "  We develop techniques to compute the k-th Moment of the Eigenvalue-statistic\nfor a random Matrix M the entries of which do not have to be necessarily\nIndependent. The dependence is controlled via an equivalence relation on the\npairs of the entries of M. Furthermore the entries are weighted, that means\nthey are multiplied with a Riemann-integrable function on (0,1). Finally also\nweak convergence in probability of the Eigenvalue statsitic is discussed not\nfor the weighted Matrix but also for band matrices the band-width of which\nbehaves like o(N).\n", "  The fundamental aspects of relaxation dynamics in Bi0.9Gd0.1Fe0.9Mn0.1O3\nmultiferroic system have been reported. The study was carried out employing\ndielectric relaxation spectroscopy covering eight decades in frequency 0.01\nto106 Hz and in a wide range of temperature 423 K to 153 K, hydrostatic\npressure 0.1 MPa to 1765 MPa and aging time 0 s to 80000 s. The temperature\ndependent dielectric response indicates three relaxations processes in the\ndynamic window of modulus formalism. Variable range hopping model of small\npolarons manifests the bulk conduction mechanism. The bulk and grain boundary\ncontributions have been estimated using impedance spectroscopy analysis and\nreveal that localized process dominates the relaxation. The direct evidence of\nglassy feature is established below 200 K by aging experiments. Our findings\nprovide a potential connection between nearly constant loss features appearing\nbelow 200 K with fastest relaxation of magnitude 0.16 eV. We also discuss the\ntime temperature superposition behavior using modulus scaling. A pressure\ndriven normal ferroelectric to relaxor behavior is witnessed above a critical\npressure as a result of relative competition between short range and long range\nforces. Our findings focus the role of high pressure as a fundamental bridge\nbetween normal ferroelectrics and relaxors. Intriguingly, there exists a direct\nconnection between chemical pressure induced by substitution and external\nhydrostatic pressure. These findings have robust fundamental importance on\ntheoretical elucidation of relaxation dynamics in perovskite systems.\n", "  The Airy integral and Bessel functions are of significant in mathematical\ndescription of spectral distribution of different types of radiation produced\nby relativistic charged particles moving in synchrotron and in periodical\nmacro- and micro-structures. A simple proof of the relation between Airy\nintegral and modified Bessel function is of most important for radiation\nphysicists, who are not expert in pure mathematics. In this paper we discuss an\nold proof proposed by Nicholson, and suggest another simple one based on the\nBowman transformation of Bessel differential equation with a complex constant.\n", "  A co-evolving and adaptive Rock (R)-Paper (P)-Scissors (S) game (ARPS) in\nwhich an agent uses one of three cyclically dominating strategies is proposed\nand studied numerically and analytically. An agent takes adaptive actions to\nachieve a neighborhood to his advantage by rewiring a dissatisfying link with a\nprobability $p$ or switching strategy with a probability $1-p$. Numerical\nresults revealed two phases in the steady state. An active phase for\n$p<p_{\\text{cri}}$ has one connected network of agents using different\nstrategies who are continually interacting and taking adaptive actions. A\nfrozen phase for $p>p_{\\text{cri}}$ has three separate clusters of agents using\nonly R, P, and S, respectively with terminated adaptive actions. A mean-field\ntheory of link densities in co-evolving network is formulated in a general way\nthat can be readily modified to other co-evolving network problems of multiple\nstrategies. The analytic results agree with simulation results on ARPS well. We\npoint out the different probabilities of winning, losing, and drawing a game\namong the agents as the origin of the small discrepancy between analytic and\nsimulation results. As a result of the adaptive actions, agents of higher\ndegrees are often those being taken advantage of. Agents with a smaller\n(larger) degree than the mean degree have a higher (smaller) probability of\nwinning than losing. The results are useful in future attempts on formulating\nmore accurate theories.\n", "  We consider billiard ball motion in a convex domain of the Euclidean plane\nbounded by a piece-wise smooth curve influenced by the constant magnetic field.\nWe show that if there exists a polynomial in velocities integral of the\nmagnetic billiard flow then every smooth piece $\\gamma$ of the boundary must be\nalgebraic and either is a circle or satisfies very strong restrictions. In\nparticular in the case of ellipse it follows that magnetic billiard is\nalgebraically not integrable for all magnitudes of the magnetic field. We\nconjecture that circle is the only integrable magnetic billiard not only in the\nalgebraic sense, but for a broader meaning of integrability. We also introduce\nthe model of Outer magnetic billiards. As an application of our method we prove\nanalogous results on algebraically integrable Outer magnetic billiards.\n", "  A peak anomaly is observed in the magnetic susceptibility as a function of\ntemperature in solid H2O near Tp=60 K. At external magnetic fields below 2 kOe,\nTp becomes positive in the temperature range between 45 and 66 K. The magnetic\nfield dependence of the susceptibility in the same temperature range exhibits\nan inverted ferromagnetic hysteretic loop superimposed on top of the\ndiamagnetic signature of ice at fields below 600 Oe. We suggest that a fraction\nof protons that are capable of undergoing correlated tunneling in a hexagonal\npath without disrupting the stoichiometry of the lattice create an induced\nmagnetic field opposite to the induced magnetic field created by the electrons\nupon application of an external field which counters the overall diamagnetism\nof the material.\n", "  By cross-matching the currently largest optical catalog of galaxy clusters\nand the NVSS radio survey database, we obtain the largest complete sample of\nbrightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) in the redshift range of 0.05<z<0.45, which\nhave radio emission and redshift information. We confirm that more powerful\nradio BCGs tend to be these optically very bight galaxies located in more\nrelaxed clusters. We derived the radio luminosity functions of BCGs from the\nlargest complete sample of BCGs, and find that the functions depend on the\noptical luminosity of BCGs and the dynamical state of galaxy clusters. However,\nthe radio luminosity function does not show significant evolution with\nredshift.\n", "  A dry deposition model suitable for use in the moment method has been\ndeveloped. Contributions from five main processes driving the deposition -\nBrownian diffusion, interception, impaction, turbulent impaction, and\nsedimentation - are included in the model. The deposition model was employed in\nthe moment method solver implemented in the OpenFOAM framework. Applicability\nof the developed expression and the moment method solver was tested on two\nexample problems of particle dispersion in the presence of a vegetation on\nsmall scales: a flow through a tree patch in 2D and a flow through a hedgerow\nin 3D. Comparison with the sectional method showed that the moment method using\nthe developed deposition model is able to reproduce the shape of the particle\nsize distribution well. The relative difference in terms of the third moment of\nthe distribution was below 10\\% in both tested cases, and decreased away from\nthe vegetation. Main source of this difference is a known overprediction of the\nimpaction efficiency. When tested on the 3D test case, the moment method\nachieved approximately eightfold acceleration compared to the sectional method\nusing 41 bins.\n", "  We first study some aspects of a physically inspired kind of a noncommutative\nspherically symmetric spacetime based on the Gaussian-smeared mass distribution\nfor a solar system scale. This leads to the elimination of a singularity\nappeared in the origin of the spacetime. Afterwards, we investigate some\nfeatures of Verlinde's scenario in the presence of the mentioned spacetime and\nderive several quantities such as Unruh-Verlinde temperature, the energy and\nthe entropic force on three different types of holographic screens, namely the\nstatic, the stretched horizon and the accelerating surface.\n", "  We study (semi)leptonic rare charm decays and its opportunities in searches\nfor physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM). In particular, we analyse the\nimpact of potential BSM physics in $c\\to ull'$ transitions, notably branching\nratios, angular observables, asymmetries and Lepton Flavour Violating (LFV)\ndecays. Testable effects are worked out model-independently and within\nLeptoquark models supplemented with flavour patterns to link $K$/$B$ decays.\n", "  Iso-electric point(IEP) is the PH, at which the $\\zeta$ potential is measured\nto be zero. The occurrence of IEP has been understood due to the neutralization\nof surface charge density (SCD) at the solid-liquid interface. In this work, we\nuse the potential trap model to study the sources of the surface charge density\nat verious PC and PH, by taking the water-silica system as an example. It is\nrevealed that in the case of $PH<8$, the SCD is mainly originated from the\ndissociation of water molecules. And the bulk ions trapped at the interface can\ndominate the SCD when $PH>9$. Due to the mass action law, the dissociation of\nwater molecules is suppressed at the PH close to IEP, leading to a zero surface\ncharge density. In this way, zero $\\zeta$ potential is obtained at the IEP. It\nhas also been obtained that the increase of the salt concentration in the water\ncan decrease the $\\zeta$ potential, but increase the surface charge density.\n", "  We generalize the 1+1-dimensional gravity formalism of Ohta and Mann to 3+1\ndimensions by developing the canonical reduction of a proposed formalism\napplied to a system coupled with a set of point particles. This is done via the\nArnowitt-Deser-Misner method and by eliminating the resulting constraints and\nimposing coordinate conditions. The reduced Hamiltonian is completely\ndetermined in terms of the particles' canonical variables (coordinates, dilaton\nfield and momenta). It is found that the equation governing the dilaton field\nunder suitable gauge and coordinate conditions, including the absence of\ntransverse-traceless metric components, is a logarithmic Schroedinger equation.\nThus, although different, the 3+1 formalism retains some essential features of\nthe earlier 1+1 formalism, in particular the means of obtaining a quantum\ntheory for dilatonic gravity.\n", "  Results in the field of mechanochemistry are summarized. For example under\nmechanical load often a solvolysis is observed instead of a simple homolytic\nbond rupture. Also a mechanically induced redox reaction was reported\nexperimentally and could be modelled theoretically. With CPMD simulations it is\npossible to understand multi-step mechanisms in full detail.\n", "  We report ac susceptibility, specific heat, and neutron scattering\nmeasurements on a dipolar-coupled antiferromagnet LiYbF$_4$. For the thermal\ntransition, the order-parameter critical exponent is found to be 0.20(1) and\nthe specific-heat critical exponent -0.25(1). The exponents agree with the 2D\nXY/h$_4$ universality class despite the lack of apparent two-dimensionality in\nthe structure. The order-parameter exponent for the quantum phase transitions\nis found to be 0.35(1) corresponding to (2+1)D. These results are in line with\nthose found for LiErF$_4$ which has the same crystal structure, but largely\ndifferent T$_N$, crystal field environment and hyperfine interactions. Our\nresults therefore experimentally establish that the dimensional reduction is\nuniversal to quantum dipolar antiferromagnets on a distorted diamond lattice.\n", "  The influence of plasma etched sample edges on electrical transport and\ndoping is studied. Through electrical transport measurements the overall doping\nand mobility are analyzed for mono- and bilayer graphene samples. As a result\nthe edge contributes strongly to the overall doping of the samples. Furthermore\nthe edge disorder can be found as the main limiting source of the mobility for\nnarrow samples.\n", "  For a rational differential operator $L=AB^{-1}$, the Lenard-Magri scheme of\nintegrability is a sequence of functions $F_n, n\\geq 0$, such that (1)\n$B(F_{n+1})=A(F_n)$ for all $n \\geq 0$ and (2) the functions $B(F_n)$ pairwise\ncommute. We show that, assuming that property $(1)$ holds and that the set of\ndifferential orders of $B(F_n)$ is unbounded, property $(2)$ holds if and only\nif $L$ belongs to a class of rational operators that we call integrable. If we\nassume moreover that the rational operator $L$ is weakly non-local and\npreserves a certain splitting of the algebra of functions into even and odd\nparts, we show that one can always find such a sequence $(F_n)$ starting from\nany function in Ker B. This result gives some insight in the mechanism of\nrecursion operators, which encode the hierarchies of the corresponding\nintegrable equations.\n", "  A covariant Hamiltonian description of Palatini's gravity on manifolds with\nboundary is presented. Palatini's gravity appears as a gauge theory satisfying\na constraint in a certain topological limit. This approach allows the\nconsideration of non-trivial topological situations. The multisymplectic\nframework for first-order covariant Hamiltonian field theories on manifolds\nwith boundary, developed in [Ib15], enables analysis of the system at the\nboundary. The reduced phase space of the system is determined to be a\nsymplectic manifold with a distinguished isotropic submanifold corresponding to\nthe boundary data of the solutions of the Euler-Lagrange equations.\n", "  Recently, the National Solar Observatory (NSO) Solar-atmosphere Pipeline\nWorking Group has undertaken the production of synoptic maps from Helioseismic\nand Magnetic Imager (HMI) magnetograms. A set of maps has been processed\nspanning the data available for 2010-2015 using twice daily images (taken at UT\nmidnight and noon) and running them through the same algorithms used to produce\nSOLIS/VSM 6302l mean-magnetic and spatial-variance maps. The contents of this\ndocument provide an overview of what these maps look like, and the processing\nsteps used to generate them from the original HMI input data.\n", "  We present a new model for multi-agent dynamics where each agent is described\nby its position and body attitude: agents travel at a constant speed in a given\ndirection and their body can rotate around it adopting different\nconfigurations. In this manner, the body attitude is described by three\northonormal axes giving an element in $SO(3)$ (rotation matrix). Agents try to\ncoordinate their body attitudes with the ones of their neighbours. In the\npresent paper, we give the Individual Based Model (particle model) for this\ndynamics and derive its corresponding kinetic and macroscopic equations.\n", "  An equation of motion formalism for excited states in variational Monte Carlo\nis derived and a pilot implementation for the Jastrow-modified antisymmetric\ngeminal power is tested. In single excitations across a range of small\nmolecules, this combination is shown to be intermediate in accuracy between\nconfiguration interaction singles and equation of motion coupled cluster with\nsingles and doubles. For double excitations, energy errors are found to be\nsimilar to those for coupled cluster.\n", "  We report, in theory and experiment, on a novel class of controlled light\ncapsules with nearly perfect darkness, directly employing intrinsic properties\nof modified Bessel-Gauss beams. These beams are able to naturally create\nthree-dimensional bottle-shaped region during propagation as long as the\nparameters are properly chosen. Remarkably, the optical bottle can be\ncontrolled to demonstrate various geometries through tuning the beam\nparameters, thereby leading to an adjustable light capsule. We provide a\ndetailed insight into the theoretical origin and characteristics of the light\ncapsule derived from modified Bessel-Gauss beams. Moreover, a binary digital\nmicromirror device (DMD) based scheme is first employed to shape the bottle\nbeams by precise amplitude and phase manipulation. Further, we demonstrate\ntheir ability for optical trapping of core-shell magnetic microparticles, which\nplay a particular role in biomedical research, with holographic optical\ntweezers. Therefore, our observations provide a new route for generating and\ncontrolling bottle beams and will widen the potentials for micromanipulation of\nabsorbing particles, aerosols or even individual atoms.\n", "  The interchange process on a finite graph is obtained by placing a particle\non each vertex of the graph, then at rate 1, selecting an edge uniformly at\nrandom and swapping the two particles at either end of this edge. In this paper\nwe develop new techniques to show the existence of a phase transition of the\ninterchange process on the 2-dimensional Hamming graph. We show that in the\nsubcritical phase, all of the cycles of the process have length $O(\\log n)$,\nwhereas in the supercritical phase a positive density of vertices lie in cycles\nof length at least $n^{2-\\varepsilon}$ for any $\\varepsilon>0$.\n", "  Polarization dependence of opto-mechanical behavior of monodomain\nphotochromic glassy liquid crystal (LC) polymers under polarized ultraviolet\nlight (PUV) is studied. Trans-cis photo-isomerization is generally known to be\nmost intense at 'parallel illumination' (polarization parallel to LC director),\nas light-medium interactions are active when polarization aligns with\ntrainsition dipole moment. We show that at parallel illumination though cis\nisomers are converted from trans the most near surface, they can be the least\nbelow certain light propagation depth. Membrane force, an average effect of\ntrans-cis conversion over propagation depths, shows a monotonic polarization\ndependence, i.e. maximum at parallel illumination, which agrees well with\nexperiment [1]. However, under strong illumination, cis\nfraction/photo-contraction distribution through depths shows deep penetration,\nswitching over the polarization dependence in photo-moment, which is related to\nphoto-contraction gradient ---- photo-moment can be maximum at 'perpendicular\nillumination' (polarization perpendicular to director) under strong light. We\ngive both intuitive explanation and analytical demonstration in thin strip\nlimit for the switchover.\n", "  We present new combinatorial objects, which we call grid-labelled graphs, and\nshow how these can be used to represent the quantum states arising in a\nscenario which we refer to as the faulty emitter scenario: we have a machine\ndesigned to emit a particular quantum state on demand, but which can make an\nerror and emit a different one. The device is able to produce a list of\ncandidate states which can be used as a kind of debugging information for\ntesting entanglement. By reformulating the Peres-Horodecki and matrix\nrealignment criteria we are able to capture some characteristic features of\nentanglement: we construct new bound entangled states, and demonstrate the\nlimitations of matrix realignment. We show how the notion of LOCC is related to\na generalisation of the graph isomorphism problem. We give a simple proof that\nasymptotically almost surely, grid-labelled graphs associated to very sparse\ndensity matrices are entangled. We develop tools for enumerating grid-labelled\ngraphs that satisfy the Peres-Horodecki criterion up to a fixed number of\nvertices, and propose various computational problems for these objects, whose\ncomplexity remains an open problem. The proposed mathematical framework also\nsuggests new combinatorial and algebraic ways for describing the structure of\ngraphs.\n", "  An analytical model is presented that can account for both electrical and hot\nand cold thermal contact resistances when calculating the efficiency of a\nthermoelectric generator. The model is compared to a numerical model of a\nthermoelectric leg, for 16 different thermoelectric materials, as well as the\nanalytical models of Ebling et. al. (2010) and Min \\& Rowe (1992). The model\npresented here is shown to accurately calculate the efficiency for all systems\nand all contact resistances considered, with an average difference in\nefficiency between the numerical model and the analytical model of\n$-0.07\\pm0.35$ pp. This makes the model more accurate than previously published\nmodels. The maximum absolute difference in efficiency between the analytical\nmodel and the numerical model is 1.14 pp for all materials and all contact\nresistances considered.\n", "  The paper shows the relationship between the major wave equations in quantum\nmechanics and electromagnetism, such as Schroedinger's equation, Dirac's\nequation and the Maxwell equations. It is shown that they can be derived in a\nstriking simple way from a common root. This root is the relativistic\nfourvector formulation of the momentum conservation law. This is shown to be a\nmore attractive starting-point than Einstein's energy relationship for moving\nparticles, which is commonly used for the purpose. The theory developed gives a\nnew interpretation for the origin of antiparticles.\n"]}
