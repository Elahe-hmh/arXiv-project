Here we study the effect of the particle-hole channel on the zero $T$\ngap $\\Delta(0)$, superfluid transition temperature $T_{\\text{c}}$ and the\npseudogap at $T_{\\text{c}}$, as well as the mean-field ratio\n$2\\Delta(0)/T_{\\text{c}}^{\\text{MF}}$, from BCS through BEC regimes, in the\nframework of a pairing fluctuation theory which includes self-consistently the\ncontributions of finite-momentum pairs. These pairs necessarily lead to a\npseudogap in single particle excitation spectrum above and below\n$T_{\\text{c}}$. We sum over the infinite particle-hole ladder diagrams so that\nthe particle-particle and particle-hole $T$-matrices are entangled with each\nother. We find that the particle-hole susceptibility has a complex dynamical\nstructure, with strong momentum and frequency dependencies, and is sensitive to\ntemperature, gap size and interaction strength. We conclude that neglecting the\nself-energy feedback causes a serious over-estimate of the particle-hole\nsusceptibility. In the BCS limit, the particle-hole channel effect may be\napproximated by the same reduction in the overall pairing strength so that the\nratio $2\\Delta(0)/T_{\\text{c}}$ is unaffected, in agreement with Gor'kov\n\\textit{et al.} to the leading order. However, the effect becomes more complex\nand pronounced in the crossover regime, where the particle-hole susceptibility\nis reduced by both a smaller Fermi surface and a big (pseudo)gap. Deep in the\nBEC regime, the particle-hole channel contributions drop to zero. We propose\nthat precision measurements of the magnetic field for Feshbach resonance at low\ntemperatures as a function of density can be used to quantify the particle-hole\nsusceptibility and test different theories.\n", "  For two Coulombically interacting electrons in a quantum dot with harmonic\nconfinement and a constant magnetic field, we show that time-dependent\nsemiclassical calculations using the Herman-Kluk initial value representation\nof the propagator lead to eigenvalues of the same accuracy as WKB calculations\nwith Langer correction. The latter are restricted to integrable systems,\nhowever, whereas the time-dependent initial value approach allows for\napplications to high-dimensional, possibly chaotic dynamics and is extendable\nto arbitrary shapes of the potential.\n", "  Starting from the experimental fact that a moving charge experiences the\nLorentz force and applying the fundamental principles of simplicity (first\norder derivatives only) and linearity (superposition principle), we show that\nthe structure of the microscopic Maxwell equations for the electromagnetic\nfields can be deduced heuristically by using the transformation properties of\nthe fields under space inversion and time reversal. Using the experimental\nfacts of charge conservation and that electromagnetic waves propagate with the\nspeed of light together with Galileo invariance of the Lorentz force allows us\nto introduce arbitrary electrodynamic units naturally.\n", "  The microwave induced elastic deformation of a metallic thin film is computed\nnumerically and we found that the deformation can be significantly enhanced at\nresonance. We show that an analytical transmission line model can reproduce the\nnumerical results almost quantitatively and at the same time reveal the\nunderlying physics.\n", "  The physics of air-water interfaces plays a central role in modern theories\nof the hydrophobic effect. Implementing these theories, however, has been\nhampered by the difficulty of addressing fluctuations in the shape of such soft\ninterfaces. We show that this challenge is a fundamental consequence of mapping\nlong wavelength density variations onto discrete degrees of freedom. Drawing\nfrom studies of surface roughness in lattice models, we account for the\nresulting nonlinearities simply but accurately. Simulations show that this\napproach captures complex solvation behaviors quantitatively.\n", "  Centrality measures such as the degree, k-shell, or eigenvalue centrality can\nidentify a network's most influential nodes, but are rarely usefully accurate\nin quantifying the spreading power of the vast majority of nodes which are not\nhighly influential. The spreading power of all network nodes is better\nexplained by considering, from a continuous-time epidemiological perspective,\nthe distribution of the force of infection each node generates. The resulting\nmetric, the \\textit{expected force}, accurately quantifies node spreading power\nunder all primary epidemiological models across a wide range of archetypical\nhuman contact networks. When node power is low, influence is a function of\nneighbor degree. As power increases, a node's own degree becomes more\nimportant. The strength of this relationship is modulated by network structure,\nbeing more pronounced in narrow, dense networks typical of social networking\nand weakening in broader, looser association networks such as the Internet. The\nexpected force can be computed independently for individual nodes, making it\napplicable for networks whose adjacency matrix is dynamic, not well specified,\nor overwhelmingly large.\n", "  Physical states of the superstring can be described in light-cone gauge by\nacting with transverse bosonic $\\alpha_{-n}^{j}$ and fermionic\n$\\bar{q}_{-n}^{\\dot{a}}$ operators on an $SO\\left(8\\right)$-covariant\nsuperfield where $j,\\dot{a}=1$ to $8$. In the pure spinor formalism, these\nstates are described in an $SO\\left(9,1\\right)$-covariant manner by the\ncohomology of the BRST charge $Q=\\frac{1}{2\\pi\ni}\\oint\\lambda^{\\alpha}d_{\\alpha}$. In this paper, a similarity transformation\nis found which simplifies the form of $Q$ and maps the light-cone description\nof the superstring vertices into DDF-like operators in the cohomology of $Q$.\n", "  A non-invasive, in-situ calibration method for Total Internal Reflection\nMicroscopy (TIRM) based on optical tweezing is presented which greatly expands\nthe capabilities of this technique. We show that by making only simple\nmodifications to the basic TIRM sensing setup and procedure, a probe particle's\nabsolute position relative to a dielectric interface may be known with better\nthan 10 nm precision out to a distance greater than 1 $\\mu$m from the surface.\nThis represents an approximate 10x improvement in error and 3x improvement in\nmeasurement range over conventional TIRM methods. The technique's advantage is\nin the direct measurement of the probe particle's scattering intensity vs.\nheight profile in-situ, rather than relying on calculations or inexact system\nanalogs for calibration. To demonstrate the improved versatility of the TIRM\nmethod in terms of tunability, precision, and range, we show our results for\nthe hindered near-wall diffusion coefficient for a spherical dielectric\nparticle.\n", "  Recent experimental results on the effect of miRNA on the decay of its target\nmRNA have been analyzed against a previously hypothesized single molecule\ndegradation pathway. According to that hypothesis, the silencing complex\n(miRISC) first interacts with its target mRNA and then recruits the protein\ncomplexes associated with NOT1 and PAN3 to trigger deadenylation (and\nsubsequent degradation) of the target mRNA. Our analysis of the experimental\ndecay patterns allowed us to refine the structure of the degradation pathways\nat the single molecule level. Surprisingly, we found that if the previously\nhypothesized network was correct, only about 7% of the target mRNA would be\nregulated by the miRNA mechanism, which is inconsistent with the available\nknowledge. Based on systematic data analysis, we propose the alternative\nhypothesis that NOT1 interacts with miRISC before binding to the target mRNA.\nMoreover, we show that when miRISC binds alone to the target mRNA, the mRNA is\ndegraded more slowly, probably through a deadenylation-independent pathway. The\nnew biochemical pathway we propose both fits the data and paves the way for new\nexperimental work to identify new interactions.\n", "  Zipf's law is just one out of many universal laws proposed to describe\nstatistical regularities in language. Here we review and critically discuss how\nthese laws can be statistically interpreted, fitted, and tested (falsified).\nThe modern availability of large databases of written text allows for tests\nwith an unprecedent statistical accuracy and also a characterization of the\nfluctuations around the typical behavior. We find that fluctuations are usually\nmuch larger than expected based on simplifying statistical assumptions (e.g.,\nindependence and lack of correlations between observations).These\nsimplifications appear also in usual statistical tests so that the large\nfluctuations can be erroneously interpreted as a falsification of the law.\nInstead, here we argue that linguistic laws are only meaningful (falsifiable)\nif accompanied by a model for which the fluctuations can be computed (e.g., a\ngenerative model of the text). The large fluctuations we report show that the\nconstraints imposed by linguistic laws on the creativity process of text\ngeneration are not as tight as one could expect.\n", "  Gauged linear sigma-models at critical coupling on Riemann surfaces yield\nself-dual field theories, their classical vacua being described by the vortex\nequations. For local models with structure group ${\\rm U}(r)$, we give a\ndescription of the vortex moduli spaces in terms of a fibration over symmetric\nproducts of the base surface $\\Sigma$, which we assume to be compact. Then we\nshow that all these fibrations induce isomorphisms of fundamental groups. A\nconsequence is that all the moduli spaces of multivortices in this class of\nmodels have abelian fundamental groups. We give an interpretation of this fact\nas a no-go theorem for the realization of nonabelions through the ground states\nof a supersymmetric version (topological via an A-twist) of these gauged\nsigma-models. This analysis is based on a semi-classical approximation of the\nQFTs via supersymmetric quantum mechanics on their classical moduli spaces.\n", "  Self-consistent solutions of Hedin's diagrammatic theory equations (HE) for\nthe two-site Hubbard Model (HM) have been studied. They have been found for\nthree-point vertices of increasing complexity ($\\Gamma=1$ (GW approximation),\n$\\Gamma_{1}$ from the first order perturbation theory, and exact vertex\n$\\Gamma_{E}$). The comparison is being made when an additional quasiparticle\n(QP) approximation for the Green function is applied during the self-consistent\niterative solving of HE and when QP approximation is not applied. The results\nobtained with the exact vertex are directly related to the presently open\nquestion - which approximation is more advantageous for future implementations\n- GW+DMFT or QPGW+DMFT. It is shown that in the regime of strong correlations\nonly originally proposed GW+DMFT scheme is able to provide reliable results.\nVertex corrections based on Perturbation Theory (PT) systematically improve the\nGW results when full self-consistency is applied. The application of the QP\nself-consistency combined with PT vertex corrections shows similar problems to\nthe case when the exact vertex is applied combined with QP sc. The analysis of\nWard Identity violation is performed for all studied in this work\napproximations and its relation to the general accuracy of the schemes used is\nprovided.\n", "  Massive early-type galaxies commonly have gas discs which are kinematically\nmisaligned with the stellar component. These discs feel a torque from the stars\nand the angular momentum vectors are expected to align quickly. We present\nresults on the evolution of a misaligned gas disc in a cosmological simulation\nof a massive early-type galaxy from the Feedback In Realistic Environments\nproject. This galaxy experiences a merger which, together with a strong\ngalactic wind, removes most of the original gas disc. The galaxy subsequently\nreforms a gas disc through accretion of cold gas, but it is initially 120\ndegrees misaligned with the stellar rotation axis. This misalignment persists\nfor about 2 Gyr before the gas-star misalignment angle drops below 20 degrees.\nThe time it takes for the gaseous and stellar components to align is much\nlonger than previously thought, because the gas disc is accreting a significant\namount of mass for about 1.5 Gyr after the merger, during which the angular\nmomentum change induced by accreted gas dominates over that induced by stellar\ntorques. Once the gas accretion rate has decreased sufficiently, the gas disc\ndecouples from the surrounding halo gas and realigns with the stellar component\nin about 6 dynamical times. During the late evolution of the misaligned gas\ndisc, the centre aligns faster than the outskirts, resulting in a warped disc.\nWe discuss the observational consequences of the long survival of our\nmisaligned gas disc and how our results can be used to calibrate merger rate\nestimates from observed gas misalignments.\n", "  Massive growth in human mobility has dramatically increased the risk and rate\nof pandemic spread. Macro-level descriptors of the topology of the World\nAirline Network (WAN) explains middle and late stage dynamics of pandemic\nspread mediated by this network, but necessarily regard early stage variation\nas stochastic. We propose that much of early stage variation can be explained\nby appropriately characterizing the local topology surrounding the debut\nlocation of an outbreak. We measure for each airport the expected force of\ninfection (AEF) which a pandemic originating at that airport would generate. We\nobserve, for a subset of world airports, the minimum transmission rate at which\na disease becomes pandemically competent at each airport. We also observe, for\na larger subset, the time until a pandemically competent outbreak achieves\npandemic status given its debut location. Observations are generated using a\nhighly sophisticated metapopulation reaction-diffusion simulator under a\ndisease model known to well replicate the 2009 influenza pandemic. The\nrobustness of the AEF measure to model misspecification is examined by\ndegrading the network model. AEF powerfully explains pandemic risk, showing\ncorrelation of 0.90 to the transmission level needed to give a disease pandemic\ncompetence, and correlation of 0.85 to the delay until an outbreak becomes a\npandemic. The AEF is robust to model misspecification. For 97% of airports,\nremoving 15% of airports from the model changes their AEF metric by less than\n1%. Appropriately summarizing the size, shape, and diversity of an airport's\nlocal neighborhood in the WAN accurately explains much of the macro-level\nstochasticity in pandemic outcomes.\n", "  Society relies and depends increasingly on information exchange and\ncommunication. In the quantum world, security and privacy is a built-in feature\nfor information processing. The essential ingredient for exploiting these\nquantum advantages is the resource of entanglement, which can be shared between\ntwo or more parties. The distribution of entanglement over large distances\nconstitutes a key challenge for current research and development. Due to losses\nof the transmitted quantum particles, which typically scale exponentially with\nthe distance, intermediate quantum repeater stations are needed. Here we show\nhow to generalise the quantum repeater concept to the multipartite case, by\nfully describing large-scale quantum networks, i.e. network nodes and their\nlong-distance links, in the language of graphs and graph states. This unifying\napproach comprises both the distribution of multipartite entanglement across\nthe network, and the protection against errors via encoding. The correspondence\nto graph states also provides a tool for optimising the architecture of quantum\nnetworks.\n", "  Biology achieves novel functions like error correction, ultra-sensitivity and\naccurate concentration measurement at the expense of free energy through\nMaxwell Demon-like mechanisms. The design principles and free energy trade-offs\nhave been studied for a variety of such mechanisms. In this review, we\nemphasize a perspective based on dynamical phases that can explain\ncommonalities shared by these mechanisms. Dynamical phases are defined by\ntypical trajectories executed by non-equilibrium systems in the space of\ninternal states. We find that coexistence of dynamical phases can have dramatic\nconsequences for function vs free energy cost trade-offs. Dynamical phases can\nalso provide an intuitive picture of the design principles behind such\nbiological Maxwell Demons.\n", "  The mesochronic velocity is the average of the velocity field along\ntrajectories generated by the same velocity field over a time interval of\nfinite duration. In this paper we classify initial conditions of trajectories\nevolving in incompressible vector fields according to the character of motion\nof material around the trajectory. In particular, we provide calculations that\ncan be used to determine the number of expanding directions and the presence of\nrotation from the characteristic polynomial of the Jacobian matrix of\nmesochronic velocity. In doing so, we show that (a) the mesochronic velocity\ncan be used to characterize dynamical deformation of three-dimensional volumes,\n(b) the resulting mesochronic analysis is a finite-time extension of the\nOkubo--Weiss--Chong analysis of incompressible velocity fields, (c) the\ntwo-dimensional mesochronic analysis from Mezic et al. \\emph{A New Mixing\nDiagnostic and Gulf Oil Spill Movement}, Science 330, (2010), 486-489, extends\nto three-dimensional state spaces. Theoretical considerations are further\nsupported by numerical computations performed for a dynamical system arising in\nfluid mechanics, the unsteady Arnold--Beltrami--Childress (ABC) flow.\n", "  Since the discovery of n-type copper oxide superconductors, the evolution of\nelectron- and hole-bands and its relation to the superconductivity have been\nseen as a key factor in unveiling the mechanism of high-Tc superconductors. So\nfar, the occurrence of electrons and holes in n-type copper oxides has been\nachieved by chemical doping, pressure, and/or deoxygenation. However, the\nobserved electronic properties are blurred by the concomitant effects such as\nchange of lattice structure, disorder, etc. Here, we report on successful\ntuning the electronic band structure of n-type Pr2-xCexCuO4 (x = 0.15)\nultrathin films, via the electric double layer transistor technique. Abnormal\ntransport properties, such as multiple sign reversals of Hall resistivity in\nnormal and mixed states, have been revealed within an electrostatic field in\nrange of -2 V to +2 V, as well as varying the temperature and magnetic field.\nIn the mixed state, the intrinsic anomalous Hall conductivity invokes the\ncontribution of both electron and hole-bands as well as the energy dependent\ndensity of states near the Fermi level. The two-band model can also describe\nthe normal state transport properties well, whereas the carrier concentrations\nof electrons and holes are always enhanced or depressed simultaneously in\nelectric fields. This is in contrast to the scenario of Fermi surface\nreconstruction by antiferromagnetism, where an anti-correlation between\nelectrons and holes is commonly expected. Our findings paint the picture where\nCoulomb repulsion plays an important role in the evolution of the electronic\nstates in n-type cuprate superconductors.\n", "  The relativistic two-body problem is considered for spinless particles\nsubject to an external macroscopic electromagnetic field. When this field is\nmade of the monochromatic superposition of two counter-propagating plane waves\n(and provided the mutual interaction between particles is known), it is\npossible to write down explicitly a pair of coupled wave equations\n(corresponding to a pair of mass-shell constraints) which takes into account\nalso the field contribution. These equations are manifestly covariant;\nconstants of the motion are exhibited, so one ends up with a reduced problem\ninvolving five degrees of freedom.\n", "  We build on recent developments in the study of fluid turbulence [Gibbon\n\\textit{et al.} Nonlinearity 27, 2605 (2014)] to define suitably scaled,\norder-$m$ moments, $D_m^{\\pm}$, of $\\omega^\\pm= \\omega \\pm j$, where $\\omega$\nand $j$ are, respectively, the vorticity and current density in\nthree-dimensional magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). We show by mathematical analysis,\nfor unit magnetic Prandtl number $P_M$, how these moments can be used to\nidentify three possible regimes for solutions of the MHD equations; these\nregimes are specified by inequalities for $D_m^{\\pm}$ and $D_1^{\\pm}$. We then\ncompare our mathematical results with those from our direct numerical\nsimulations (DNSs) and thus demonstrate that 3D MHD turbulence is like its\nfluid-turbulence counterpart insofar as all solutions, which we have\ninvestigated, remain in \\textit{only one of these regimes}; this regime has\ndepleted nonlinearity. We examine the implications of our results for the\nexponents $q^{\\pm}$ that characterize the power-law dependences of the energy\nspectra $\\mathcal{E}^{\\pm}(k)$ on the wave number $k$, in the inertial range of\nscales. We also comment on (a) the generalization of our results to the case\n$P_M \\neq 1$ and (b) the relation between $D_m^{\\pm}$ and the order-$m$ moments\nof gradients of hydrodynamic fields, which are used in characterizing\nintermittency in turbulent flows.\n", "  We investigate the effect of the cosmological expansion on the bending of\nlight due to an isolated point-like mass. We adopt McVittie metric as the model\nfor the geometry of the lens. Assuming a constant Hubble factor we find an\nanalytic expression involving the bending angle, which turns out to be\nunaffected by the cosmological expansion at the leading order.\n", "  We discuss the local density approximation approach to calculating the ground\nstate energy of a one-dimensional Fermi gas containing a single impurity, and\ncompare the results with exact numerical values that we have for up to 11\nparticles for general interaction strengths and up to 30 particles in the\nstrongly interacting case. We also calculate the contact coefficient in the\nstrongly interacting regime. The different theoretical predictions are compared\nto recent experimental results with few-atom systems. Firstly, we find that the\nlocal density approximation suffers from great ambiguity in the few-atom\nregime, yet it works surprisingly well for some models. Secondly, we find that\nthe strong interaction theories quickly break down when the number of particles\nincrease or the interaction strength decreases.\n", "  The production cross sections of the B+, B0, and B0s mesons, and of their\ncharge conjugates, are measured via exclusive hadronic decays in pPb collisions\nat the center-of-mass energy sqrt(s_NN) = 5.02 TeV with the CMS detector at the\nCERN LHC. The data set used for this analysis corresponds to an integrated\nluminosity of 34.6 inverse nanobarns. The production cross sections are\nmeasured in the transverse momentum range between 10 and 60 GeV/c. No\nsignificant modification is observed compared to proton-proton perturbative QCD\ncalculations scaled by the number of incoherent nucleon-nucleon collisions.\nThese results provide a baseline for the study of in-medium b quark energy loss\nin PbPb collisions.\n", "  Tunneling of electrons through rotor-stator anthracene aldehyde molecular\ninterfaces is studied with a combined ab initio and model approach. Molecular\nelectronic structure calculated from first principles is utilized to model\ndifferent shapes of tunneling barriers. Together with a rectangular barrier, we\nalso consider a sinusoidal shape that captures the effects of the molecular\ninternal structure more realistically. Quasiclassical approach with the\nSimmons' formula for current density is implemented. Special attention is paid\non conformational dependence of the tunneling current. Our results confirm that\nthe presence of the side aldehyde group enhances the interesting electronic\nproperties of the pure anthracene molecule, making it a bistable system with\ngeometry dependent transport properties. We also investigate the transition\nvoltage and we show that confirmation dependent field emission could be\nobserved in these molecular interfaces at realistically low voltages. The\npresent study accompanies our previous work where we investigated the coherent\ntransport via strongly coupled delocalized orbital by application of\nNon-equilibrium Green's Function Formalism.\n", "  We characterize the luminosity functions of galaxies residing in $z\\sim0$\ngroups and clusters over the broadest ranges of luminosity and mass reachable\nby the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Our measurements cover four orders of\nmagnitude in luminosity, down to about $M_r=-12$ mag or $L=10^7\\,L_\\odot$, and\nthree orders of magnitude in halo mass, from $10^{12}$ to $10^{15} \\, {\\rm\nM}_\\odot$. We find a characteristic scale, $M_r\\sim-18$ mag or $L\\sim10^9\\,\nL_\\odot$, below which the slope of the luminosity function becomes\nsystematically steeper. This trend is present for all halo masses and\noriginates mostly from red satellites. This ubiquitous faint-end upturn\nsuggests that it is formation, rather than halo-specific environmental effect,\nthat plays a major role in regulating the stellar masses of faint satellites.\nWe show that the satellite luminosity functions can be described in a simple\nmanner by a double Schechter function with amplitudes scaling with halo mass\nover the entire range of observables. Combining these conditional luminosity\nfunctions with the dark matter halo mass function, we accurately recover the\nentire field luminosity function over 10 visual magnitudes and reveal that\nsatellite galaxies dominate the field luminosity function at magnitudes fainter\nthan $-17$. We find that the luminosity functions of blue and red satellite\ngalaxies show distinct shapes and we present estimates of the stellar mass\nfraction as a function of halo mass and galaxy type. Finally, using a simple\nmodel, we demonstrate that the abundances and the faint-end slopes of blue and\nred satellite galaxies can be interpreted in terms of their formation history,\nwith two distinct modes separated by some characteristic time.\n", "  We report on the inclusive production cross sections of J/$\\psi$, $\\psi$(2S),\n$\\Upsilon$(1S), $\\Upsilon$(2S) and $\\Upsilon$(3S), measured at forward rapidity\nwith the ALICE detector in pp collisions at a center-of-mass energy\n$\\sqrt{s}=8$ TeV. The analysis is based on data collected at the LHC and\ncorresponds to an integrated luminosity of 1.28 pb$^{-1}$. Quarkonia are\nreconstructed in the dimuon-decay channel. The differential production cross\nsections are measured as a function of the transverse momentum $p_{\\rm T}$ and\nrapidity $y$, over the $p_{\\rm T}$ ranges $0<p_{\\rm T}<20$ GeV/$c$ for\nJ/$\\psi$, $0<p_{\\rm T}<12$ GeV/$c$ for all other resonances, and for $2.5<y<4$.\nThe cross sections, integrated over $p_{\\rm T}$ and $y$, and assuming\nunpolarized quarkonia, are $\\sigma_{{\\rm J}/\\psi} = 8.98\\pm0.04\\pm0.82$ $\\mu$b,\n$\\sigma_{\\psi{\\rm (2S)}} = 1.23\\pm0.08\\pm0.22$ $\\mu$b,\n$\\sigma_{\\Upsilon{\\rm(1S)}} = 71\\pm6\\pm7$ nb, $\\sigma_{\\Upsilon{\\rm(2S)}} =\n26\\pm5\\pm4$ nb and $\\sigma_{\\Upsilon{\\rm(3S)}} = 9\\pm4\\pm1$ nb, where the first\nuncertainty is statistical and the second one is systematic. These values\nagree, within at most $1.4\\sigma$, with measurements performed by the LHCb\ncollaboration in the same rapidity range.\n", "  We investigate the spectrum of the self-similar Laplacian, which generates\nthe so-called \"$pq$ random walk\" on the integer half-line $\\mathbb{Z}_+$. Using\nthe method of spectral decimation, we prove that the spectral type of the\nLaplacian is singularly continuous whenever $p\\neq \\frac{1}{2}$. This serves as\na toy model for generating singularly continuous spectrum, which can be\ngeneralized to more complicated settings. We hope it will provide more insight\ninto Fibonacci and other weakly self-similar models.\n", "  We study the helical edge states of a two-dimensional topological insulator\nwithout axial spin symmetry due to the Rashba spin-orbit interaction. Lack of\naxial spin symmetry can lead to so-called generic helical edge states, which\nhave energy-dependent spin orientation. This opens the possibility of inelastic\nbackscattering and thereby nonquantized transport. Here we find analytically\nthe new dispersion relations and the energy dependent spin orientation of the\ngeneric helical edge states in the presence of Rashba spin-orbit coupling\nwithin the Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang model, for both a single isolated edge and for\na finite width ribbon. In the single-edge case, we analytically quantify the\nenergy dependence of the spin orientation, which turns out to be weak for a\nrealistic HgTe quantum well. Nevertheless, finite size effects combined with\nRashba spin-orbit coupling result in two avoided crossings in the energy\ndispersions, where the spin orientation variation of the edge states is very\nsignificantly increased for realistic parameters. Finally, our analytical\nresults are found to compare well to a numerical tight-binding regularization\nof the model.\n", "  Double electron capture is a rare nuclear decay process in which two orbital\nelectrons are captured simultaneously in the same nucleus. Measurement of its\ntwo-neutrino mode would provide a new reference for the calculation of nuclear\nmatrix elements whereas observation of its neutrinoless mode would demonstrate\nlepton number violation. A search for two-neutrino double electron capture on\n$^{124}$Xe is performed using 165.9 days of data collected with the XMASS-I\nliquid xenon detector. No significant excess above background was observed and\nwe set a lower limit on the half-life as $4.7 \\times 10^{21}$ years at 90%\nconfidence level. The obtained limit has ruled out parts of some theoretical\nexpectations. We obtain a lower limit on the $^{126}$Xe two-neutrino double\nelectron capture half-life of $4.3 \\times 10^{21}$ years at 90% confidence\nlevel as well.\n", "  We consider a particular instance of the truncated realizability problem on\nthe $d-$dimensional lattice. Namely, given two functions $\\rho_1({\\bf i})$ and\n$\\rho_2({\\bf i},{\\bf j})$ non-negative and symmetric on $\\mathbb{Z}^d$, we ask\nwhether they are the first two correlation functions of a translation invariant\npoint process. We provide an explicit construction of such a realizing process\nfor any $d\\geq 2$ when the radial distribution has a specific form. We also\nderive from this construction a lower bound for the maximal realizable density\nand compare it with the already known lower bounds.\n", "  We study SU(2) gauge theory with two Dirac fermions in the adjoint\nrepresentation of the gauge group on the lattice. Using clover improved Wilson\nfermion action with hypercubic truncated stout smearing we perform simulations\nat larger coupling than earlier. We measure the evolution of the coupling\nconstant using the step scaling method with Schr\\\"odinger functional and study\nthe remaining discretization effects. At weak coupling we observe significant\ndiscretization effects, which make it difficult to obtain a fully controlled\ncontinuum limit. Nevertheless, the data remains consistent with the existence\nof a fixed point in the interval $2.2\\lesssim g^{\\ast 2}\\lesssim 3$. We also\nmeasure the anomalous dimension and find its value at the fixed point is\n$\\gamma^\\ast\\simeq 0.2\\pm 0.03$.\n", "  We construct condensate states encoding the continuum spherically symmetric\nquantum geometry of an horizon in full quantum gravity, i.e. without any\nclassical symmetry reduction, in the group field theory formalism. Tracing over\nthe bulk degrees of freedom, we show how the resulting reduced density matrix\nmanifestly exhibits an holographic behavior. We derive a complete orthonormal\nbasis of eigenstates for the reduced density matrix of the horizon and use it\nto compute the horizon entanglement entropy. By imposing consistency with the\nhorizon boundary conditions and semiclassical thermodynamical properties, we\nrecover the Bekenstein--Hawking entropy formula for any value of the Immirzi\nparameter. Our analysis supports the equivalence between the von Neumann\n(entanglement) entropy interpretation and the Boltzmann (statistical) one.\n", "  A search for dark matter was conducted by looking for an annual modulation\nsignal due to the Earth's rotation around the Sun using XMASS, a single phase\nliquid xenon detector. The data used for this analysis was 359.2 live days\ntimes 832 kg of exposure accumulated between November 2013 and March 2015. When\nwe assume Weakly Interacting Massive Particle (WIMP) dark matter elastically\nscattering on the target nuclei, the exclusion upper limit of the WIMP-nucleon\ncross section 4.3$\\times$10$^{-41}$cm$^2$ at 8 GeV/c$^2$ was obtained and we\nexclude almost all the DAMA/LIBRA allowed region in the 6 to 16 GeV/c$^2$ range\nat $\\sim$10$^{-40}$cm$^2$. The result of a simple modulation analysis, without\nassuming any specific dark matter model but including electron/$\\gamma$ events,\nshowed a slight negative amplitude. The $p$-values obtained with two\nindependent analyses are 0.014 and 0.068 for null hypothesis, respectively. we\nobtained 90\\% C.L. upper bounds that can be used to test various models. This\nis the first extensive annual modulation search probing this region with an\nexposure comparable to DAMA/LIBRA.\n", "  We theoretically and experimentally investigate visco-thermal effects on the\nacoustic propagation through metamaterials consisting of rigid slabs with\nsubwavelength slits embedded in air. We demonstrate that this unavoidable loss\nmechanism is not merely a refinement, but it plays a dominant role in the\nactual acoustic response of the structure. Specifically, in the case of very\nnarrow slits, the visco-thermal losses avoid completely the excitation of\nFabry-Perot resonances, leading to 100% reflection. This is exactly opposite to\nthe perfect transmission predicted in the idealised lossless case. Moreover,\nfor a wide range of geometrical parameters, there exists an optimum slit width\nat which the energy dissipated in the structure can be as high as 50%. This\nwork provides a clear evidence that visco-thermal effects are necessary to\ndescribe realistically the acoustic response of locally resonant metamaterials.\n", "  The observed pattern of neutrino mixing angles is in good agreement with the\nhypothesis of neutrino anarchy, which posits that Nature has chosen the entries\nof the leptonic mixing matrix at random. In this paper we investigate how\nstable this conclusion is under renormalization group effects. Working in the\nsimplest type-I seesaw model and two variants of the inverse seesaw model we\nstudy how the statistical distributions of the neutrino mixing parameters\nevolve between the Grand Unification scale and the electroweak scale.\nEspecially in the inverse seesaw case we find significant distortions: mixing\nangles tend to be smaller after RG running, and the Dirac CP phase tends to be\ncloser to zero. The p-value describing the compatibility between the observed\nmixing angles and the anarchy hypothesis increases by 10-20%. This illustrates\nthat RG effects are highly relevant for quantitative studies of the anarchy\nscenario.\n", "  Based on the integral representation of the semiclassical propagator of\nHerman and Kluk (HK), and in the limit of high temperatures, we formulate a\nhybrid expression for the correlation function of infrared spectroscopy. This\nis achieved by performing a partial linearization inside the integral over the\ndifference of phase space variables that occurs after a twofold application of\nthe HK propagator. A numerical case study for a coupled anharmonic oscillator\nshows that already for a total number of only two degrees of freedom, one of\nwhich is treated in the simplified manner, a substantial reduction of the\nnumerical effort is achieved.\n", "  The state-following technique allows the study of metastable glassy states\nunder external perturbations. Here we show how this construction can be used to\nstudy the behavior of glassy states of Hard Spheres in infinite dimensions\nunder compression or shear strain. In a preceding work it has been shown that\nin both cases, when the external perturbation is sufficiently strong, glassy\nstates undergo a second-order transition, called the Gardner transition,\nwhereupon a hierarchical structure of marginal micro-states manifests within\nthe original glass state. The purpose of this work is to study the solution of\nthe state-following construction in this marginal phase. We show that upon\ncompression, close to the jamming transition, the metastable states are\ndescribed by a scaling solution characterized by a set of non-trivial critical\nexponents that agree with the results obtained in a preceding work, and we\ncompute the value of the final jamming density for various glassy states.\nMoreover we show that under the action of the shear strain, beyond the Gardner\npoint, the metastable states can be followed in the marginal phase and we\ndetect an overshoot in the stress-strain curve in agreement with numerical and\nexperimental observations. Finally we further characterize the Gardner\ntransition point by computing both the critical 4-point susceptibility and the\nexponents that characterize the critical slowing down of the dynamics within a\nglassy state close to the transition.\n", "  Traditional excursion set based models of H II bubble growth during the epoch\nof reionization are known to violate photon number conservation, in the sense\nthat the mass fraction in ionized bubbles in these models does not equal the\nratio of the number of ionizing photons produced by sources and the number of\nhydrogen atoms in the intergalactic medium. E.g., for a Planck13 cosmology with\nelectron scattering optical depth $\\tau\\simeq0.066$, the discrepancy is\n$\\sim15$ per cent for $x_{\\rm HII}=0.1$ and $\\sim5$ per cent for $x_{\\rm\nHII}=0.5$. We demonstrate that this problem arises from a fundamental\nconceptual shortcoming of the excursion set approach (already recognised in the\nliterature on this formalism) which only tracks average mass fractions instead\nof the exact, stochastic source counts. With this insight, we build an\napproximately photon number conserving Monte Carlo model of bubble growth based\non partitioning regions of dark matter into halos. Our model, which is formally\nvalid for white noise initial conditions (ICs), shows dramatic improvements in\nphoton number conservation, as well as substantial differences in the bubble\nsize distribution, as compared to traditional models. We explore the trends\nobtained on applying our algorithm to more realistic ICs, finding that these\nimprovements are robust to changes in the ICs. Since currently popular\nsemi-numerical schemes of bubble growth also violate photon number\nconservation, we argue that it will be worthwhile to pursue new, explicitly\nphoton number conserving approaches. Along the way, we clarify some\nmisconceptions regarding this problem that have appeared in the literature.\n", "  A mixed semiclassical initial value representation expression for\nspectroscopic calculations is derived. The formulation takes advantage of the\ntime-averaging filtering and the hierarchical properties of different\ntrajectory based propagation methods. A separable approximation is then\nintroduced that greatly reduces (about an order of magnitude) the computational\ncost compared with a full Herman-Kluk time-averaging semiclassical calculation\nfor the same systems. The expression is exact for the harmonic case and it is\ntested numerically for a Morse potential coupled to one or two additional\nharmonic degrees of freedom. Results are compared to full Herman-Kluk\ntime-averaging calculations and exact quantum wavepacket propagations. We found\nthe peak positions of the mixed semiclassical approximations to be always in\nvery good agreement with full quantum calculations, while overtone peak\nintensities are lower with respect to the exact ones. Given the reduced\ncomputational effort required by this new mixed semiclassical approximation, we\nbelieve the present method to make spectroscopic calculations available for\nhigher dimensional systems than accessible before.\n", "  In 1964-1974, the German artist Max Ernst created, with the help of two\nfriends, a series of works (books, movie, paintings) related to the astronomer\nWilhelm Tempel. Mixing actual texts by Tempel and artistic features, this\nseries pays homage to the astronomer by recalling his life and discoveries.\nMoreover, the core of the project, the book Maximiliana or the Illegal Practice\nof Astronomy, actually depicts the way science works, making this artwork a\nmost original tribute to a scientist.\n", "  The production of Z bosons in pPb collisions at sqrt(s[NN]) = 5.02 TeV is\nstudied by the CMS experiment via the electron and muon decay channels. The\ninclusive cross section is compared to pp collision predictions, and found to\nscale with the number of elementary nucleon-nucleon collisions. The\ndifferential cross sections as a function of the Z boson rapidity and\ntransverse momentum are measured. Though they are found to be consistent within\nuncertainty with theoretical predictions both with and without nuclear effects,\nthe forward-backward asymmetry suggests the presence of nuclear effects at\nlarge rapidities. These results provide new data for constraining nuclear\nparton distribution functions.\n", "  Results are presented from a search for supersymmetric particles in scenarios\nwith a compressed mass spectrum. The data sample corresponds to 19.7 inverse\nfemtobarns of proton-proton collisions recorded by the CMS experiment at\nsqrt(s) = 8 TeV. The search targets top squark pair production in scenarios\nwith mass differences Delta m = m(top squark) - m(neutralino) below the W-boson\nmass and with top-squark decays in the four-body mode (top squark to b l nu\nneutralino), where the neutralino is assumed to be the lightest supersymmetric\nparticle (LSP). The signature includes a high transverse momentum (pt) jet\nassociated with initial-state radiation, one or two low-pt leptons, and\nsignificant missing transverse energy. The event yields observed in data are\nconsistent with the expected background contributions from standard model\nprocesses. Limits are set on the cross section for top squark pair production\nas a function of the top squark and LSP masses. Assuming a 100% branching\nfraction for the four-body decay mode, top-squark masses below 316 GeV are\nexcluded for Delta m = 25 GeV at 95% CL. The dilepton data are also interpreted\nunder the assumption of chargino-neutralino production, with subsequent decays\nto sleptons or sneutrinos. Assuming a difference between the common lightest\nchargino/next lightest neutralino mass and the LSP mass of 20 GeV and a\ntau-enriched decay scenario, masses in the range m(chargino) < 307 GeV are\nexcluded at 95% CL.\n", "  We describe updates to the \\redmapper{} algorithm, a photometric red-sequence\ncluster finder specifically designed for large photometric surveys. The updated\nalgorithm is applied to $150\\,\\mathrm{deg}^2$ of Science Verification (SV) data\nfrom the Dark Energy Survey (DES), and to the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)\nDR8 photometric data set. The DES SV catalog is locally volume limited, and\ncontains 786 clusters with richness $\\lambda>20$ (roughly equivalent to\n$M_{\\rm{500c}}\\gtrsim10^{14}\\,h_{70}^{-1}\\,M_{\\odot}$) and $0.2<z<0.9$. The DR8\ncatalog consists of 26311 clusters with $0.08<z<0.6$, with a sharply increasing\nrichness threshold as a function of redshift for $z\\gtrsim 0.35$. The\nphotometric redshift performance of both catalogs is shown to be excellent,\nwith photometric redshift uncertainties controlled at the $\\sigma_z/(1+z)\\sim\n0.01$ level for $z\\lesssim0.7$, rising to $\\sim0.02$ at $z\\sim0.9$ in DES SV.\nWe make use of \\emph{Chandra} and \\emph{XMM} X-ray and South Pole Telescope\nSunyaev-Zeldovich data to show that the centering performance and\nmass--richness scatter are consistent with expectations based on prior runs of\n\\redmapper{} on SDSS data. We also show how the \\redmapper{} \\photoz{} and\nrichness estimates are relatively insensitive to imperfect star/galaxy\nseparation and small-scale star masks.\n", "  At the heart of systems chemistry lies the idea that supramolecular\ninteractions can give rise to complex and unexpected collective states that\nemerge on a fundamentally different lengthscale to that of the interactions\nthemselves. While in certain cases - e.g. the self-assembly of virus-like\npolyhedral cages from coordination building blocks - it is possible to control\nemergence in a systematic manner, the development of general approaches remains\na fundamental challenge in the field. In the conceptually-related domain of\nfrustrated magnetism - where collective states give rise to exotic physics of\nrelevance to data storage and spintronics - the task of predicting emergent\nbehaviour is simplified through control over the geometry and form of the\nmagnetic interactions from which complexity arises. Seeking to combine\napproaches from these two fields, we study here the solid phases of inorganic\npolymer chains assembled from non-magnetic gold(I)/silver(I) cations and\ncyanide anions. We show the periodic inter-chain potential encodes a\nsupramolecular interaction that can be tuned to mimic different magnetic\ninteractions between XY spins (\"spin rotors\"). Because the chains pack on a\ntriangular lattice, the crystal structures of gold(I)/silver(I) cyanides can be\ninterpreted in terms of the phase behaviour of triangular XY magnets. Complex\nmagnetic states predicted for this family - including hidden quadrupolar order\nand emergent spin-vortex quasiparticles - are realised for the first time in\nthe structural chemistry of these cyanide polymers. In this way we demonstrate\nboth how simple inorganic materials might behave as structural analogues of\notherwise-unrealisable \"toy\" spin models, and also how a theoretical\nunderstanding of those models might be used to predict and control emergent\nphenomena in chemical systems.\n", "  The relations between most observables associated with a compact star, such\nas the mass and radius of a neutron star or a quark star, typically depend\nstrongly on their unknown internal structure. The I-Love-Q relations (between\nthe moment of inertia, the tidal deformability and the quadrupole moment) are\nhowever approximately insensitive to this structure. These relations become\nexact for stationary black holes in General Relativity as shown by the no-hair\ntheorems. In this paper, we take the first steps toward studying how the\napproximate I-Love-Q relations become exact in the limit as compact stars\nbecome black holes. To do so, we consider a toy model, i.e. incompressible\nstars with anisotropic pressure, which allows us to model an equilibrium\nsequence of stars with their compactness approaching the black hole limit\narbitrarily closely. We extract the I-Love-Q trio by numerically constructing\nsuch a sequence in the slow-rotation and small-tide approximations. We find\nthat the I-Love-Q relations approach the black hole limit in a nontrivial way,\nwith the quadrupole moment and the tidal deformability changing sign as the\ncompactness and the amount of anisotropy are increased. Generalizing Maclaurin\nspheroids to anisotropic stars, we show that the multipole moments also change\nsign in the Newtonian limit as the amount of anisotropy is increased. We also\nprove analytically that the stellar moment of inertia reaches the black hole\nlimit as the compactness reaches the black hole value in the strongly\nanisotropic limit. Modeling the black hole limit through a sequence of\nanisotropic stars, however, fails when considering other theories of gravity.\nWe calculate the scalar dipole charge and the moment of inertia in a\nparity-violating modified theory and find that these quantities do not tend to\ntheir black hole counterparts as the anisotropic stellar sequence approaches\nthe black hole limit.\n", "  We revisit the accuracy of the post-Newtonian (PN) approximation and its\nregion of validity for quasi-circular orbits of a point particle in the Kerr\nspacetime, by using an analytically known highest post-Newtonian order\ngravitational energy flux and accurate numerical results in the black hole\nperturbation approach. It is found that regions of validity become larger for\nhigher PN order results although there are several local maximums in regions of\nvalidity for relatively low-PN order results. This might imply that higher PN\norder calculations are also encouraged for comparable-mass binaries.\n", "  We consider equilibrium states of weakly coupled anharmonic quantum\noscillators on Z. We consider the Resolvent CCR Algebra introduced by\nD.Buchholtz and H.Grundling, and we show that the infinite volume limit of\nequilibrium states satisfies the KMS (Kubo-Martin-Schwinger) condition with\ngood regularity(= locally Fock representation).\n  Uniqueness of the KMS states is proven as well.\n", "  We consider conformal blocks of two heavy operators and an arbitrary number\nof light operators in a (1+1)-d CFT with large central charge. Using the\nmonodromy method, these higher-point conformal blocks are shown to factorize\ninto products of 4-point conformal blocks in the heavy-light limit for a class\nof OPE channels. This result is reproduced by considering suitable worldline\nconfigurations in the bulk conical defect geometry. We apply the CFT results to\ncalculate the entanglement entropy of an arbitrary number of disjoint intervals\nfor heavy states. The corresponding holographic entanglement entropy calculated\nvia the minimal area prescription precisely matches these results from CFT.\nAlong the way, we briefly illustrate the relation of these conformal blocks to\nRiemann surfaces and their associated moduli space.\n", "  We propose a system of sine-Gordon equations, with the $\\mathcal{PT}$\nsymmetry represented by balanced gain and loss in them. The equations are\ncoupled by sine-field terms and first-order derivatives. The sinusoidal\ncoupling stems from local interaction between adjacent particles in the coupled\nFrenkel-Kontorova (FK) chains and related sine-lattices, while the\ncross-derivative coupling, which was not considered before, is induced by\n\\emph{three-particle} interactions, provided that the particles in the parallel\nFK\\ chains move in different directions. Nonlinear wave structures are then\nstudied in this model. In particular, kink-kink (KK) and kink-antikink (KA)\ncomplexes are explored by means of analytical and numerical methods. It is\npredicted analytically and confirmed numerically that the complexes are\nunstable for one sign of the sinusoidal coupling, and stable for another.\nStability regions are delineated in the underlying parameter space. Unstable\ncomplexes split into free kinks/antikinks that may propagate or become\nstationary, depending on whether they are subject to gain or loss,\nrespectively.\n", "  A new PLIC (piecewise linear interface calculation)-type VOF (volume of\nfluid) method, called APPLIC (approximated PLIC) method, is presented. Although\nthe PLIC method is one of the most accurate VOF methods, the three-dimensional\nalgorithm is complex. Accordingly, it is hard to develop and maintain the\ncomputational code. The APPLIC method reduces the complexity using simple\napproximation formulae. Three numerical tests were performed to compare the\naccuracy of the SVOF (simplified volume of fluid), VOF/WLIC (weighed line\ninterface calculation), THINC/SW (tangent of hyperbola for interface\ncapturing/slope weighting), THINC/WLIC, PLIC, and APPLIC methods. The results\nof the tests show that the APPLIC results are as accurate as the PLIC results\nand are more accurate than the SVOF, VOF/WLIC, THINC/SW, and THINC/WLIC\nresults. It was demonstrated that the APPLIC method is more computationally\nefficient than the PLIC method.\n", "  We theoretically study the Coulomb drag resistivity in a double-layer\nelectron system with highly anisotropic parabolic band structure using\nBoltzmann transport theory. As an example, we consider a double-layer\nphosphorene on which we apply our formalism. This approach, in principle, can\nbe tuned for other double-layered systems with paraboloidal band structures.\nOur calculations show the rotation of one layer with respect to another layer\ncan be considered a way of controlling the drag resistivity in such systems. As\na result of rotation, the off-diagonal elements of drag resistivity tensor have\nnon-zero values at any temperature. In addition, we show that the anisotropic\ndrag resistivity is very sensitive to the direction of momentum transfer\nbetween two layers due to highly anisotropic inter-layer electron-electron\ninteraction and also the plasmon modes. In particular, the drag anisotropy\nratio, \\r{ho}yy/\\r{ho}xx, can reach up to ~ 3 by changing the temperature.\nFurthermore,our calculations suggest that including the local field correction\nin dielectric function changes the results significantly. Finally, We examine\nthe dependence of drag resistivity and its anisotropy ratio on various\nparameters like inter-layer separation, electron density, short-range\ninteraction and insulating substrate/spacer.\n", "  We characterize two 40 kBq sources of electrodeposited Th-228 for use in\nlow-background experiments. The sources efficiently emanate Rn-220, a noble gas\nthat can diffuse in a detector volume. Rn-220 and its daughter isotopes produce\nalpha, beta, and gamma-radiation, which may used to calibrate a variety of\ndetector responses and features, before decaying completely in only a few days.\nWe perform various tests to place limits on the release of other long-lived\nisotopes. In particular, we find an emanation of <0.008 atoms/min/kBq (90% CL)\nfor Th-228 and 1.53 atoms/min/kBq for Ra-224. The sources lend themselves in\nparticular to the calibration of detectors employing liquid noble elements such\nas argon and xenon. With the source mounted in a noble gas system, we\ndemonstrate that filters are highly efficient in reducing the activity of these\nlonger-lived isotopes further. We thus confirm the suitability of these sources\neven for use in next-generation experiments, such as XENON1T/XENONnT, LZ, and\nnEXO.\n", "  Galaxy clusters are the largest gravitationally bound objects in the universe\nand may be suitable targets for indirect dark matter searches. With 85 months\nof Fermi-LAT Pass 8 publicly available data, we analyze the gamma-ray emission\nin the directions of 16 nearby Galaxy Clusters with an unbinned likelihood\nanalysis. No globally statistically-significant $\\gamma-$ray line feature is\nidentified and a tentative line signal may be present at $\\sim 43$ GeV. The\n95\\% confidence level upper limits on the velocity-averaged cross section of\ndark matter particles annihilating into double $\\gamma-$rays (i.e., $\\langle\n\\sigma v \\rangle_{\\chi\\chi\\rightarrow \\gamma\\gamma}$) are derived. Unless very\noptimistic boost factors of dark matter annihilation in these Galaxy Clusters\nhave been assumed, such constraints are much weaker than the bounds set by the\nGalactic $\\gamma-$ray data.\n", "  According to the general-relativistic no-hair theorem, astrophysical black\nholes depend only on their masses and spins and are uniquely described by the\nKerr metric. Mass and spin are the first two multipole moments of the Kerr\nspacetime and completely determine all other moments. The no-hair theorem can\nbe tested by measuring potential deviations from the Kerr metric which alter\nsuch higher-order moments. In this review, I discuss tests of the no-hair\ntheorem with current and future observations of such black holes across the\nelectromagnetic spectrum, focusing on near-infrared observations of the\nsupermassive black hole at the Galactic center, pulsar-timing and very-long\nbaseline interferometric observations, as well as X-ray observations of\nfluorescent iron lines, thermal continuum spectra, variability, and\npolarization.\n", "  Superconductivity research is like running a marathon. Three decades after\nthe discovery of high-Tc cuprates, there have been mass data generated from\ntransport measurements, which bring fruitful information. In this review, we\ngive a brief summary of the intriguing phenomena reported in electron-doped\ncuprates from the aspect of electrical transport as well as the complementary\nthermal transport. We attempt to sort out common features of the electron-doped\nfamily, e.g. the strange metal, negative magnetoresistance, multiple sign\nreversals of Hall in mixed state, abnormal Nernst signal, complex quantum\ncriticality. Most of them have been challenging the existing theories,\nnevertheless, a unified diagram certainly helps to approach the nature of\nelectron-doped cuprates.\n", "  Most, if not all, stars in the field are born in binary configurations or\nhigher multiplicity systems. In dense stellar environment such as the Galactic\nCenter (GC), many stars are expected to be in binary configurations as well.\nThese binaries form hierarchical triple body systems, with the massive black\nhole (MBH) as the third, distant object. The stellar binaries are expected to\nundergo large amplitude eccentricity and inclination oscillations via the\nso-called \"eccentric Kozai-Lidov\" (EKL) mechanism. These eccentricity\nexcitations, combined with post main sequence stellar evolution, can drive the\ninner stellar binaries to merge. We study the mergers of stellar binaries in\nthe inner 0.1 pc of the GC caused by gravitational perturbations due to the\nMBH. We run a large set of Monte Carlo simulations that include the secular\nevolution of the orbits, general relativistic precession, tides, and\npost-main-sequence stellar evolution. We find that about 13 % of the initial\nbinary population will have merged after a few million years and about 29 %\nafter a few billion years. These expected merged systems represent a new class\nof objects at the GC and we speculate that they are connected to G2-like\nobjects and the young stellar population.\n", "  In this work, we study the suitability of different thermoelectric materials\nlike $Bi_2Te_3$, $Sb_{2}Te_{3}$, $PbTe$, $TAGS$, $CeFe_{4}Sb_{12}$, $SiGe$ and\n$TiO_{1.1}$ in estimation of thermoelectric generator's (TEG) efficiency. The\nefficiency of TEG made up of ${Be_{2}Te_{3}}$ or $Sb_{2}Te_{3}$ gives $\\sim$7\\%\nin temperature range of 310 K - 500 K. $PbTe$ or $TAGS$ or $CeFe_{4}Sb_{12}$\ngives $\\sim$6\\% in temperature range of 500 K - 900 K and $SiGe$ or $TiO_{1.1}$\nalso have remarkable efficiency in higher temperature range i.e $\\sim$1200 K.\nHere, we report the enhancement of efficiency by using hybridization technique\nfor different combination of above-mentioned materials. Hybridization of two\ndifferent materials of TEG module is done by considering compatibility factor\naspect. To this end, the proposed values of overall efficiency of TEG by\nhybridizing ${Be_{2}Te_{3}}$ and $PbTe$; ${Be_{2}Te_{3}}$ and $TAGS$;\n$Bi_{2}Te_{3}$ and $CeFe_{4}Sb_{12}$ are 12\\%, 14\\% and 11.88\\%, respectively,\nfor temperature range of 310 K to 900 K, which can be installed in an\nautomobile. For steel industry and spacecraft application (till 1200 K)\nhybridization of $Bi_{2}Te_{3}$, $PbTe$ and $SiGe$; ${Be_{2}Te_{3}}$ and\n$TiO_{1.1}$ yields efficiency of $\\sim$15.2\\% and $\\sim$17.2\\%, respectively.\nThe proposed results can be treated as a viable option for engineers, who are\nlooking for fabricating TEG in real life applications such as automobile,\nspacecraft and steel industry.\n", "  The present article can be considered as a complement to the work P.R.D 93,\n045002 (2016) where an nonperturbative approach to QED with x-electric critical\npotential steps was developed. In the beginning we study conditions when in-\nand out-spaces of the QED under consideration are unitarily equivalent. Then we\nconstruct a general density operator with the vacuum initial condition. Such an\noperator describes a deformation of the initial vacuum state by x-electric\ncritical potential steps. We construct reductions of the deformed state to\nelectron and positron subsystems, calculating the loss of the information in\nthese reductions. We illustrate the general consideration studying the\ndeformation of the quantum vacuum between two capacitor plates. Finally we\ncalculate the entanglement measures of these reduced matrices as von Neumann\nentropies.\n", "  A diffraction experiment using a high energy x-ray was carried out on\nYbInCu4. Below the Yb valence transition temperature, the splitting of Bragg\npeaks was detected in higher-order reflections. No superlattice reflections\naccompanying the valence ordering were found below the transition temperature.\nThese experimental findings indicate that a structural change from a cubic\nstructure to a tetragonal structure without valence ordering occurs at the\ntransition temperature. Such a structural change free from any valence ordering\nis difficult to understand only in terms of Yb valence degrees of freedom. This\nmeans that the structural change may be related to electronic symmetries such\nas quadrupolar degrees of freedom as well as the change in Yb valence.\n", "  NaFeAs belongs to a class of Fe-based superconductors which parent compounds\nshow separated structural and magnetic transitions. Effects of the structural\ntransition on spin dynamics therefore can be investigated separately from the\nmagnetic transition. A plateau in dynamic spin response is observed in a\ncritical region around the structural transition temperature T_S. It is\ninterpreted as due to the stiffening of spin fluctuations along the in-plane\nmagnetic hard axis due to the dxz and dyz orbital ordering. The appearance of\nanisotropic spin dynamics in the critical region above the T_S at T* offers a\ndynamic magnetic scattering mechanism for anisotropic electronic properties in\nthe commonly referred \"nematic phase\".\n", "  The QCD axion with $f_a$ at an intermediate scale, 10**9-10**12 GeV, seems in\nconflict with the gravity spoil of global symmetries and may face the axionic\ndomain wall problem. We point out that the string compactifications with an\nanomalous U(1) gauge symmetry, allowing desirable chiral matter spectra,\ncircumvent these two problems simultaneously.\n", "  In this work, some aspects of the ambitwistor pure spinor string are\ninvestigated. The $b$ ghost is presented and its main properties are derived in\na simple way, very similar to the usual pure spinor $b$ ghost construction. The\nheterotic case is also addressed with a new proposal for the BRST charge. The\nBRST cohomology is shown to correctly describe the heterotic supergravity\nspectrum and a semi-composite $b$ ghost is constructed.\n", "  We examine the free energy and the thermodynamic properties in the\nthree-chain Hubbard model for Ta2NiSe5 to clarify the phase transitions between\nthe uniform and the FFLO excitonic states which are expected to be observed in\nTa2NiSe5 under high pressure.\n", "  The Solar Aspect Monitor (SAM) is a pinhole camera on the Extreme-ultraviolet\nVariability Experiment (EVE) aboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). SAM\nprojects the solar disk onto the CCD through a metallic filter designed to\nallow only solar photons shortward of 7 nm to pass. Contamination from\nenergetic particles and out-of-band irradiance is, however, significant in the\nSAM observations. We present a technique for isolating the 0.01--7 nm\nintegrated irradiance from the SAM signal to produce the first results of\nbroadband irradiance for the time period from May 2010 to May 2014. The results\nof this analysis agree with a similar data product from EVE's EUV\nSpectroPhotometer (ESP) to within 25%. We compare our results with measurements\nfrom the Student Nitric Oxide Explorer (SNOE) Solar X-ray Photometer (SXP) and\nthe Thermosphere Ionosphere Mesosphere Energetics and Dynamics (TIMED) Solar\nEUV Experiment (SEE) at similar levels of solar activity. We show that the\nfull-disk SAM broadband results compare well to the other measurements of the\n0.01--7 nm irradiance. We also explore SAM's capability toward resolving\nspatial contribution from regions of solar disk in irradiance and demonstrate\nthis feature with a case study of several strong flares that erupted from\nactive regions on March 11, 2011.\n", "  A variational Monte Carlo method for bosonic lattice models is introduced.\nThe method is based on the Baeriswyl projected wavefunction. The Baeriswyl\nwavefunction consists of a kinetic energy based projection applied to the\nwavefunction at infinite interaction, and is related to the shadow wavefunction\nalready used in the study of continuous models of bosons. The wavefunction at\ninfinite interaction, and the projector, are represented in coordinate space,\nleading to an expression for expectation values which can be evaluated via\nMonte Carlo sampling. We calculate the phase diagram and other properties of\nthe bosonic Hubbard model. The calculated phase diagram is in excellent\nagreement with known quantum Monte Carlo results. We also analyze correlation\nfunctions.\n", "  We study the moduli space of type IIB string theory flux compactifications on\nthe mirror of the CY quintic 3-fold in P4. We focus on the dynamics of the four\ndimensional moduli space, defined by the axio-dilaton {\\tau} and the complex\nstructure modulus z. The z-plane has critical points, the conifold, the\norbifold and the large complex structure with non trivial monodromies. We find\nthe solutions to the Picard-Fuchs equations obeyed by the periods of the CY in\nthe full z-plane as a series expansion in z around the critical points to\narbitrary order. This allows us to discard fake vacua, which appear as a result\nof keeping only the leading order term in the series expansions. Due to\nmonodromies vacua are located at a given sheet in the z-plane. A dS vacuum\nappears for a set of fluxes. We revisit vacua with hierarchies among the 4D and\n6D physical scales close to the conifold point and compare them with those\nfound at leading order in [1, 2]. We explore slow-roll inflationary directions\nof the scalar potential by looking at regions where the multi-field slow-roll\nparameters {\\epsilon} and {\\eta} are smaller than one. The value of {\\epsilon}\ndepends strongly on the approximation of the periods and to achieve a stable\nvalue, several orders in the expansion are needed. We do not find realisations\nof single field axion monodromy inflation. Instead, we find that inflationary\nregions appear along linear combinations of the four real field directions and\nfor certain configurations of fluxes.\n", "  The present work deals with four alternative formulation of Bekenstein system\non event horizon in $f(R)$ gravity. While thermodynamical laws holds in\nuniverse bounded by apparent horizon, these laws break down on event horizon.\nWith alternative formulation of thermodynamical parameters (temperature and\nentropy), thermodynamical laws hold on event horizon in Einstein Gravity. With\nthis motivation, we extend the idea of generalised Hawking temperature and\nmodified Bekenstein entropy in homogeneous and isotropic model of universe on\nevent horizon and examine whether thermodynamical laws hold in f(R) gravity.\nSpecifically, we examine and compare validity of generalised second law of\nthermodynamics (GSLT) and thermodynamical equilibrium (TE) in four alternative\nmodified Bekenstein scenarios. As Dark energy is a possible dominant candidate\nfor matter in the univerese and Holographic Dark Energy (HDE) can give\neffective description of f(R) gravity, so matter in the universe is taken as in\nthe form interacting HDE. In order to understand the complicated expressions,\nfinally the above laws are examined from graphical representation using three\nPlanck data sets and it is found that generalised/modified Hawking temperature\nhas a crucial role in making perfect thermodynamical system.\n", "  Since X-ray tomography is now widely adopted in many different areas, it\nbecomes more crucial to find a robust routine of handling tomographic data to\nget quality reconstructed images. Though there are several existing techniques,\nit seems helpful to have a more automated method to remove the possible errors\nthat hinder clearer image reconstruction. Here, we proposed an alternative\nmethod and new algorithm using the sinogram and the fixed point. A new physical\nconcept of Center of Attenuation (CA) was also introduced to figure out how\nthis fixed point is applied to the image reconstruction with errors we further\ncategorized. Our technique showed a promising performance in restoring images\nwith translation and vertical tilt errors.\n", "  We investigate the scattering response of parity-time (PT) symmetric\nstructures. We show that, due to the local flow of energy between gain and loss\nregions, such systems can deflect light in unusual ways, as a function of the\ngain/loss contrast. Such structures are highly anisotropic and their scattering\npatterns can drastically change as a function of the angle of incidence. In\naddition, we derive a modified optical theorem for PT-symmetric scattering\nsystems, and discuss its ramifications.\n", "  We report the first observation of stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) with\nBrillouin lasing, and Brillouin-coupled four-wave-mixing (FWM) in an\nultra-high-Q silica microbottle resonator. The Brillouin lasing was observed at\nthe frequency of $\\Omega_B=2\\pi\\times10.4$ GHz with a threshold power of $0.45$\nmW. Coupling between Brillouin and FWM was observed in both backward and\nforward scattering directions with separations of $2\\Omega_B$. At a pump power\nof $10$ mW, FWM spacing reached to 7th and 9th order anti-Stokes and Stokes,\nrespectively.\n", "  Comets provide a unique insight into the molecular composition and complexity\nof the material in the primordial solar nebula. Recent results from the Rosetta\nmission, currently monitoring comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko in situ, and ALMA\n(the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array), have demonstrated a\ntantalising link between the chemical complexity now confirmed in disks (via\nthe detection of gas-phase CH3CN; Oberg et al. 2015) and that confirmed on the\nsurface of 67P (Goesmann et al. 2015), raising questions concerning the\nchemical origin of such species (cloud or inheritance versus disk synthesis).\nResults from an astrochemical model of a protoplanetary disk are presented in\nwhich complex chemistry is included and in which it is assumed that simple ices\nonly are inherited from the parent molecular cloud. The model results show good\nagreement with the abundances of several COMs observed on the surface of 67P\nwith Philae/COSAC. Cosmic-ray and X-ray-induced photoprocessing of\npredominantly simple ices inherited by the protoplanetary disk is sufficient to\ngenerate a chemical complexity similar to that observed in comets. This\nindicates that the icy COMs detected on the surface of 67P may have a disk\norigin. The results also show that gas-phase CH3CN is abundant in the inner\nwarm disk atmosphere where hot gas-phase chemistry dominates and potentially\nerases the ice chemical signature. Hence, CH3CN may not be an unambiguous\ntracer of the complex organic ice reservoir. However, a better understanding of\nthe hot gas-phase chemistry of CH3CN is needed to confirm this preliminary\nconclusion.\n", "  Combining the co-evolving chemistry, hydrodynamics and radiative transfer is\nan important step for star formation studies. It allows both a better link to\nobservations and a self-consistent monitoring of the magnetic dissipation in\nthe collapsing core. Our aim is to follow a chemo-dynamical evolution of\ncollapsing dense cores with a reduced gas-grain chemical network. We present\nthe results of radiative hydrodynamic (RHD) simulations of 1 M$_\\odot$ isolated\ndense core collapse. The physical setup includes RHD and dynamical evolution of\na chemical network. To perform those simulations, we merged the\nmulti-dimensional adaptive-mesh-refinement code RAMSES and the thermo-chemistry\nParis-Durham shock code. We simulate the formation of the first hydro-static\ncore (FHSC) and the co-evolution of 56 species describing mainly H-C-O\nchemistry. Accurate benchmarking is performed, testing the reduced chemical\nnetwork against a well-establiched complex network. We show that by using a\ncompact set of reactions, one can match closely the CO abundances with results\nof a much more complex network. Our main results are: (a) We find that\ngas-grain chemistry post-processing can lead to one order of magnitude lower CO\ngas-phase abundances compared to the dynamical chemistry, with strongest effect\nduring the isothermal phase of collapse. (b) The free-fall time has little\neffect on the chemical abundances for our choice of the parameters. (c)\nDynamical chemical evolution is required to describe the CO gas phase abundance\nas well as the CO ice formation for the mean grain size larger then 1$\\mu{}$m.\n(d) Furthermore, dust mean size and size distribution have a strong effect on\nchemical abundances and hence on the ionization degree and magnetic\ndissipation. We conclude that dust grain growth in the collapse simulations can\nbe as important as coupling the collapse with chemistry.\n", "  The Annular Groove Phase Mask (AGPM) is a vectorial vortex phase mask. It\nacts as a half-wave plate with a radial fast axis orientation operating in the\nmid infrared domain. When placed at the focus of a telescope element provides a\ncontinuous helical phase ramp for an on axis sources, which creates the orbital\nangular momentum. Thanks to that phase, the intensity of the central source is\ncanceled by a down-stream pupil stop, while the off axis sources are not\naffected. However due to experimental conditions the nulling is hardly perfect.\nTo improve the null, a Mach-Zehnder interferometer containing Dove prisms\ndifferently oriented can be proposed to sort out light based on its orbital\nangular momentum (OAM). Thanks to the differential rotation of the beam, a\n{\\pi} phase shift is achieved for the on axis light affected by a non zero OAM.\nTherefore the contrast between the star and its faint companion is enhanced.\nNevertheless, due the Dove prisms birefringence, the performance of the\ninterferometer is relatively poor. To solve this problem, we propose to add a\nbirefringent wave-plate in each arm to compensate this birefringence. In this\npaper, we will develop the mathematical model of the wave front using the Jones\nformalism. The performance of the interferometer is at first computed for the\nsimple version without the birefringent plate. Then the effect of the\nbirefringent plate is be mathematically described and the performance is\nre-computed.\n", "  In the context of polymer surface treatment, the afterglow of an atmospheric\npressure Ar/O$_2$ radiofrequency plasma is characterized by optical emission\nspectroscopy, laser induced fluorescence and mass spectrometry. The influence\nof the O$_2$ gas flow rate and the source power on the plasma properties (gas\ntemperature, Ar excitation temperature, relative concentrations of O atoms and\nOH radicals) are evaluated. We show that for plasma torch-to-substrate\ndistances lower than 6 mm, the afterglow creates a protective atmosphere, thus\nthe plasma gas composition interacting with the substrate is well controlled.\nFor higher distances, the influence of ambient air can no longer be neglected\nand gradients in Ar, O$_2$ and N$_2$ concentrations are measured as a function\nof axial and vertical position.\n", "  2-ns waveforms with 7 eigenvalues and their QPSK-modulated spectral\namplitudes were optimized by taking constraints of link, transmitter, and\nreceiver into account. In experiment these signals were transmitted with a BER\nof 3.2E-3 over 1440-km of NZ-DSF fiber spans.\n", "  R\\'enyi and entanglement entropies are constructed for 2d q-deformed\ntopological Yang-Mills theories with gauge group $U(N)$, as well as the dual 3d\nChern-Simons (CS) theory on Seifert manifolds. When $q=\\exp[2\\pi i/(N+K)]$, and\n$K$ is odd, the topological R\\'enyi entropy and Wilson line observables of the\nCS theory can be expressed in terms of the modular transformation matrices of\nthe WZW theory, $\\rm{\\hat{U}(N)}_{K,N(K+N)}$. If both $K$ and $N$ are odd,\nthere is a level-rank duality of the 2d qYM theory and of the associated CS\ntheory, as well as that of the R\\'enyi and entanglement entropies, and Wilson\nline observables.\n", "  A research complex for aerospace radiation effects research has been proposed\nin Harbin Institute of Technology. Its core part is a proton accelerator\ncomplex, which consists of a 10 MeV injector, a 300 MeV synchrotron and beam\ntransport lines. The proton beam extracted from the synchrotron is utilized for\nthe radiation effects research. Based on the conceptual design [1], the design\nstudy for optimizing the synchrotron has been done. A new lattice design was\nworked out, and the multi-turn injection and slow extraction system were\noptimized with the new lattice design. In order to improve the time structure\nof the extracted beam, a RF knock-out method is employed. To meet the\nrequirement of accurate control of dose, the frequency of the RF kicker is well\ninvestigated.\n", "  In the present work, multiwalled carbon nanotubes were decorated with rhodium\nnanoparticles using a colloidal solution in the post-discharge of an RF\natmospheric plasma of argon (Ar) or argon/oxygen (Ar:O$_2$). The properties of\nthese hybrid materials towards the room temperature detection of NO$_2$,\nC$_2$H$_4$, CO, C$_6$H$_6$ and moisture were investigated and discussed in view\nof compositional and morphological studies. It was found that the presence of\noxygen in the plasma treatment is essential to significantly enhance the gas\nresponse of Rh-decorated multiwalled carbon nanotubes and to avoid response\nsaturation even at low gas/vapor concentrations. These desirable effects are\nattributed to the presence of oxygen during the CNT plasma treatment since\noxygenated vacancies act both as active adsorption sites for gases and as\nanchoring sites for Rh nanoparticles (the presence of Rh nanoclusters is nearly\ndoubled in Ar-O$_2$ treated samples as compared to Ar treated samples). The\noxygen treatment also makes easier the charge transfer between Rh nanoparticles\nand carbon nanotubes upon gas adsorption. The method for treating and\ndecorating multiwalled carbon nanotubes used here is simple, fast and scalable\nfor producing gas sensitive nanohybrid materials with uniform and\nwell-controlled properties.\n", "  We assess the predictive power of alchemical perturbations for estimating\nfundamental properties in ionic crystals. Using density functional theory we\nhave calculated formation energies, lattice constants, and bulk moduli for all\nsixteen iso-valence-electronic combinations of pure pristine alkali halides\ninvolving elements $A \\in \\{$Na, K, Rb, Cs$\\}$ and $X \\in \\{$F, Cl, Br, I$\\}$.\nFor rock salt, zincblende and cesium chloride symmetry, alchemical\nHellmann-Feynman derivatives, evaluated along lattice scans of sixteen\nreference crystals, have been obtained for all respective 16$\\times$15\ncombinations of reference and predicted target crystals. Mean absolute errors\n(MAE) are on par with density functional theory level of accuracy for energies\nand bulk modulus. Predicted lattice constants are less accurate. NaCl is the\nbest reference salt for alchemical estimates of relative energies (MAE $<$ 40\nmeV/atom) while alkali fluorides are the worst. By contrast, lattice constants\nare predicted best using NaF as a reference salt (MAE $<$ 0.5{\\AA}), yielding\nonly semi-quantitative accuracy. The best reference salt for the prediction of\nbulk moduli is CsCl (MAE $<$ 0.4$\\times$10$^{11}$ dynes/cm$^2$). Alchemical\nderivatives can also be used to predict competing rock salt and cesium chloride\nphases in binary and ternary solid mixtures with CsCl. Alchemical predictions\nbased on dispersion corrected density functional theory with pure RbI as a\nreference salt reproduce reasonably well the reversal of the rock salt/cesium\nchloride stability trend for binary $(AX)_{1-x}$CsCl$_x$ as well as for ternary\n$(AX)_{0.5-0.5x}(BY)_{0.5-0.5x}$CsCl$_x$ mixtures.\n", "  Current theories assume that the low intensity of the stellar extragalactic\nbackground light (stellar EBL) is caused primarily by finite age of the\nUniverse because the finite age limits the number of photons pumped into the\nspace by galaxies and thus the sky is dark in the night. We oppose this opinion\nand show that two main factors are responsible for the extremely low intensity\nof the observed stellar EBL: (1) a low mean surface brightness of galaxies,\nwhich causes a low luminosity density in the local Universe, and (2) light\nextinction due to absorption by galactic and intergalactic dust. Dust produces\na partial opacity of galaxies and of the Universe. The galactic opacity reduces\nthe intensity of light from more distant background galaxies obscured by\nforeground galaxies. The effective extinction AV for light passing through a\ngalaxy is 0.2 mag. This causes that distant background galaxies do not\ncontribute to the EBL significantly. In addition, light of distant galaxies is\ndimmed due to absorption by intergalactic dust. Even a minute intergalactic\nopacity of 1x10^(-2) mag per Gpc is high enough to produce significant effects\non the EBL. The absorbed starlight heats up the galactic and intergalactic dust\nand is further re-radiated at the IR, FIR and micro-wave spectrum. Assuming\nstatic infinite universe with no galactic and intergalactic dust, the stellar\nEBL should be as high as the surface brightness of stars. However, if dust is\nconsidered, the predicted stellar EBL is about 290 nWm^(-2)sr^(-1), which is\nonly 5 times higher than the observed value. Hence, the presence of dust has\nhigher impact on the EBL than currently assumed. In the expanding universe, the\ncalculated value of the EBL is further decreased, because the obscuration\neffect and intergalactic absorption become more pronounced at high redshifts\nwhen the matter was concentrated at smaller volume than at present.\n", "  The extremal functional method determines approximate solutions to the\nconstraints of crossing symmetry, which saturate bounds on the space of unitary\nCFTs. We show that such solutions are characterized by extremality conditions,\nwhich may be used to flow continuously along the boundaries of parameter space.\nAlong the flow there is generically no further need for optimization, which\ndramatically reduces computational requirements, bringing calculations from the\nrealm of computing clusters to laptops. Conceptually, extremality sheds light\non possible ways to bootstrap without positivity, extending the method to\nnon-unitary theories, and implies that theories saturating bounds, and\nespecially those sitting at kinks, have unusually sparse spectra. We discuss\nseveral applications, including the first high-precision bootstrap of a\nnon-unitary CFT.\n", "  We report tests and results from a new approach to the spectral density and\nthe mode number distribution of the Dirac operator in lattice gauge theories.\nThe algorithm generates the spectral density of the lattice Dirac operator as a\ncontinuous function over all scales of the complete eigenvalue spectrum. This\nis distinct from an earlier method where the integrated spectral density (mode\nnumber) was calculated efficiently for some preselected fixed range of the\nintegration. The new algorithm allows global studies like the chiral condensate\nfrom the Dirac spectrum at any scale including the cutoff-dependent IR and UV\nrange of the spectrum. Physics applications include the scale-dependent mass\nanomalous dimension, spectral representation of composite fermion operators,\nand the crossover transition from the $\\epsilon$-regime of Random Matrix Theory\nto the p-regime in chiral perturbation theory. We present thorough tests of the\nalgorithm in the 2-flavor sextet SU(3) gauge theory that we continue to pursue\nfor its potential as a minimal realization of the composite Higgs scenario.\n", "  We define knowledge as facts, information, and skills acquired by a person\nthrough experience or education. In turn, Disciplinary Knowledge is the\nknowledge related to a specific field or discipline, such as physics.\nAccountable Disciplinary Knowledge (ADK) is \"what counts\" as important to a\ncommunity or discipline: the kinds of activities that participants engage in,\nthe problems they value and solve, and methods for solving those problems.\nBecause ADK is determined on a community basis, the details of \"what counts\"\nwill vary with the norms and expectations of the community. In this paper, we\nuse the ADK framework to investigate \"what counts\" as solving problems well in\na high school physics classroom from the perspective of the students.\n", "  Using the inverse dimensional expansion method we study the elastic\ninstability of black rings found recently in numerical analysis of fully\nnonlinear dynamical evolutions. In our analysis we should perform 1/D^1/2\nexpansions, not usual 1/D expansions, of the Einstein equations to capture this\nelastic instability of D dimensional black rings. By solving the Einstein\nequations at large D we obtain the effective equations for black rings, and the\nperturbation analysis of the large D effective equations with 1/D^1/2\nexpansions yields the formula for quasinormal mode frequencies. From this\nformula, we find that black rings actually suffer from both elastic and\nGregory-Laflamme like instabilities. These instabilities are coupled and appear\nat the same time as observed in numerical analysis. The elastic instability\ndoes disappear at the infinite limit of a ring radius, which implies that the\n(boosted) black string is stable to elastic perturbations. Furthermore we\nobserve that the Gregory-Laflamme like instability becomes more efficient than\nthe elastic instability even for certain thin black rings in enough higher\ndimensions.\n", "  We have studied the emergence of bound states in weakly deformed and/or\nheterogeneous waveguides, comparing the analytical predictions obtained using a\nrecently developed perturbative method, with precise numerical results, for\ndifferent configurations (a homogeneous asymmetric waveguide, a heterogenous\nasymmetric waveguide and a homogeneous broken-strip). In all the examples\nconsidered in this paper we have found excellent agreement between analytical\nand numerical results, thus providing a numerical verification of the\nanalytical approach.\n", "  This study was undertaken to develop a system for heat transfer simulation\nfor optimization and treatment planning of magnetic hyperthermia treatment\n(MHT) using magnetic particle imaging (MPI). First, we performed phantom\nexperiments to obtain the regression equation between the MPI pixel value and\nthe specific absorption rate (SAR) of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs), from which\nthe MPI pixel value was converted to the SAR value in the simulation. Second,\nwe generated the geometries for use in the simulation by processing X-ray\ncomputed tomography (CT) and MPI images of tumor-bearing mice injected\nintratumorally with MNPs (Resovist). The geometries and MPI images were then\nimported into software based on a finite element method (COMSOL Multiphysics)\nto compute the time-dependent temperature distribution for 20 min after the\nstart of MHT. There was an excellent correlation between the MPI pixel value\nand the SAR value (r = 0.956). There was good agreement between the time course\nof the temperature rise in the tumors obtained by simulation and that obtained\nexperimentally. The time-dependent temperature distributions under various\nblood perfusion rates in the tumors and at various locations could be\nsimulated, which cannot be easily obtained experimentally. These results\nsuggest that our system for heat transfer simulation using MPI will be useful\nfor the optimization and treatment planning of MHT.\n", "  This paper presents a secular term removal methodology based on the homotopy\nperturbation method for analytical solutions of nonlinear problems with\nperiodic boundary condition. The analytical solution for groundwater response\nto tidal fluctuation in a coastal unconfined aquifer system with the vertical\nbeach is provided as an example. The non-linear one-dimensional Boussinesq's\nequation is considered as the governing equation for the groundwater flow. An\nanalytical solution is provided for non-dimensional Boussinesq's equation with\ncosine harmonic boundary condition representing tidal boundary condition. The\nanalytical solution is obtained by using homotopy perturbation method with a\nvirtual embedding parameter. The present approach does not require\npre-specified perturbation parameter and also facilitates secular terms\nelimination in the perturbation solution. The solutions starting from\nzeroth-order up to third-order are obtained. The non-dimensional expression,\n$A/D_{\\infty}$ emerges as an implicit parameter from the homotopy perturbation\nsolution. The non-dimensional solution is valid for all ranges of $A/D$ values.\nHigher order solution reveals the characteristics of the tidal groundwater\ntable fluctuations.\n", "  Via molecular dynamics simulations, we study the kinetics in a phase\nseparating active matter model. Quantitative results for the isotropic\nbicontinuous pattern formation, its growth and aging, studied, respectively,\nvia the two-point equal-time density-density correlation function, the average\ndomain length and the two-time density autocorrelation function, are presented.\nBoth the correlation functions exhibit basic scaling properties, implying\nself-similarity in the pattern dynamics, for which the average domain size\nexhibits a power-law growth in time. The equal-time correlation has a short\ndistance behavior that provides reasonable agreement of the corresponding\nstructure factor tail with the Porod law. The autocorrelation decay is a\npower-law in the average domain size. Apart from these basic similarities, the\nquantitative behavior of the above mentioned observables are found to be vastly\ndifferent from those of the corresponding passive limit of the model which also\nundergoes phase separation. The functional forms of these have been quantified.\nAn exceptionally rapid growth in the active system occurs due to fast coherent\nmotion of the particles, mean-squared-displacements of which exhibit multiple\nscaling regimes, including a long time ballistic one.\n", "  We present an investigation of the thermoelectric properties of cubic\nperovskite SrTiO3. The results are derived from a combination of calculated\ntransport functions obtained from Boltzmann transport theory in the constant\nscattering time approximation based on the electronic structure and existing\nexperimental data for La-doped SrTiO3. The figure of merit ZT is modeled with\nrespect to carrier concentration and temperature. The model predicts a\nrelatively high $ZT$ at optimized doping, and suggests that the $ZT$ value can\nreach 0.7 at T = 1400 K. Thus $ZT$ can be improved from the current\nexperimental values by carrier concentration optimization.\n", "  The Coulomb displacement energies of the neutron-rich Ar-K isobaric analog\nstate pairs with mass number $A=35-47$ are calculated within the relativistic\nmean field model and the effects of level inversion on the Coulomb displacement\nenergies of the Ar-K isobaric analog state pairs are studied. The calculations\nare carried out in two cases, with and without consideration of the possible\n$2s_{1/2}$ and $1d_{3/2}$ proton level inversion of the neutron-rich Ar\nisotopes. Results show that the $2s_{1/2}$ and $1d_{3/2}$ level inversion of\nthe neutron-rich Ar isotopes may reduce the Coulomb displacement energy by\n0.06$\\sim$0.17 MeV for the Ar-K isobaric analog state pairs. The results may\nprovide a reference for experimental investigations of nuclear level inversion\nand a new test of the relativistic mean field model.\n", "  The long-wave dynamics of liquid films on isothermal substrates show a\ndynamic competition between various physical mechanisms. If the destabilizing\neffect of thermocapillarity overcomes the stabilizing effect of surface tension\nand gravity, the liquid film ruptures in finite time, through the formation of\nprimary and secondary thermocapillary finger structures.\n  The long-wave evolution dynamics are compared for two different substrate\ntypes: isothermal non-porous and isothermal porous for small Biot number in a\nzero gravity environment. The multi-time-scale dynamics is revealed through\ntime scales obtained from a method of similarity solutions. It is observed that\nwith an isothermal porous substrate, in zero gravity, secondary thermocapillary\nstructures are damped through imbibition and that primary thermocapillary\nstructures persist for long times without rupture.\n", "  This work explores the application of a new one-dimensional carbon\nnanomaterial, the diamond nanothread (DNT), as a reinforcement for\nnanocomposites. Owing to the existence of Stone-Wales transformation defects,\nthe DNT intrinsically possesses irregular surfaces, which is expected to\nenhance the non-covalent interfacial load transfer. Through a series of in\nsilico pull-out studies of the DNT in polyethylene (PE) matrix, we found that\nthe load transfer between DNT and PE matrix is dominated by the non-covalent\ninteractions, in particular the van der Waals interactions. Although the\nhydrogenated surface of the DNT reduces the strength of the van der Waals\ninteractions at the interface, the irregular surface of the DNT can compensate\nfor the weak bonds. These factors lead to an interfacial shear strength of the\nDNT/PE interface comparable with that of the carbon nanotube (CNT)/PE\ninterface. Our results show that the DNT/PE interfacial shear strength remains\nhigh even as the number of Stone-Wales transformation defects decreases. It can\nbe enhanced further by increasing the PE density or introduction of functional\ngroups to the DNT, both of which greatly increase the non-covalent\ninteractions.\n", "  Recently a new class of single-photon timed-Dicke (TD) subradiant states has\nbeen introduced with possible applications in single-photon based quantum\ninformation storage and on demand ultrafast retrieval [Scully M. O., Phys. Rev.\nLett., 115 (2015) 243602]. However, the influence of any kind of virtual\nprocesses on the decay of these new kind of subradiant states has been left as\nan open question. In the present paper, we focus on this problem in detail. In\nparticular, we investigate how pure Fano-Agarwal couplings and other virtual\nprocesses arising from non-rotating wave approximation impact the decay of\notherwise sub and superradiant states. In addition to the overall virtual\ncouplings among all TD states, we also focus on the dominant role played by the\ncouplings between specific TD states.\n", "  We theoretically investigate the emission spectrum of an optomechanical\nTavis-Cummings model: two dipole-dipole interacting atoms coupled to an\noptomechanical cavity (OMC). In particular, we study the influence of\ndipole-dipole interaction (DDI) on the single-photon spectrum emitted by this\nhybrid system in the presence of a strong atom-cavity as well as strong\noptomechanical interaction (hereinafter called the strong-strong coupling). We\nalso show that our analysis is amenable to inclusion of mechanical losses\n(under the weak mechanical damping limit) and single-photon loss through\nspontaneous emission from the two-level emitters under a non-local Lindblad\nmodel.\n", "  The present work is based upon a parametric reconstruction of the effective\nor total equation of state in a model for the universe with accelerated\nexpansion. The constraints on the model parameters are obtained by maximum\nlikelihood analysis using the supernova distance modulus data, observational\nHubble data, baryon acoustic oscillation data and cosmic microwave background\nshift parameter data. For statistical comparison, the same analysis has also\nbeen carried out for the wCDM dark energy model. Different model selection\ncriteria (Akaike information criterion (AIC)) and (Bayesian Information\nCriterion (BIC)) give the clear indication that the reconstructed model is well\nconsistent with the wCDM model. Then both the models (w_{eff}(z) model and wCDM\nmodel) have also been presented through (q_0 ,j_0 ) parameter space. Tighter\nconstraint on the present values of dark energy equation of state parameter\n(w_{DE}(z = 0)) and cosmological jerk (j_0) have been achieved for the\nreconstructed model.\n", "  High-precision electroweak production measurements from the Tevatron and the\nLHC provide important constraints on the quark flavor separation in global PDF\nfits. In this contribution, we study the impact of the recent D0 W asymmetry\nmeasurements and of the LHCb W and Z Run I combination in the global NNPDF\nanalysis. We find that these measurements can be described by NLO QCD theory\nand that they lead to a significant reduction of PDF uncertainties.\n", "  Some consequences of a fully classical unified theory of gravity and\nelectromagnetism are worked out for the electromagnetic sector such as the\noccurrence of classical light beams with spin and orbital angular momenta that\nare topologically quantized in units of $q_e q_m=\\sigma$, independent of the\nbeam size. Empirical fits require $\\sigma = \\hbar$. The theory also predicts a\ngeneralized coherency matrix whose consequences are testable.\n", "  Global distribution of the Terrestrial Gamma-ray Flashes (TGFs) detected by\nAGILE and RHESSI for the period from March 2009 to July 2012 has been analysed.\nA fourth TGF production region has been distinguished over the Pacific. It is\nconfirmed that TGF occurrence follows the Intertropical Convergence Zone(ITCZ)\nseasonal migration and prefers afternoons. TGF/lightning ratio appears to be\nlower over America than other regions suggesting that meteorological regional\ndifferences are important for the TGF production. Diurnal cycle of TGFs peaks\nin the afternoon suggesting that Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE)\nand convection are important for TGF production. Moreover all AGILE passages\nover South America in the same period have been analysed to find meteorological\npreferences for TGF occurrence. In each passage the analysis of Cloud Top\nAltitude (CTA), CAPE, number of strokes, number of storms and coverage area of\nclouds with temperatures below $-70\\,^{\\circ}{\\rm C}$ (Cloud Top Coverage area,\nCTC) are computed. On average, AGILE has been exposed to 19,100 strokes between\neach TGF representing $\\sim$68 hours of exposure over active storms. High CAPE\nvalues, high cloud tops and high stroke occurrence suggests that meteorological\nconditions conducive to vigorous and electrically active storms are important\nfor TGF production. It is shown that a high number of thunderstorms is\npreferable for TGF production which may be explained by a greater chance of the\npresence of a thunderstorm in the best development stage for TGF production.\nHigh tropopause altitude seems to be important but not primordial for TGF\nproduction.\n", "  Spin-spin correlations and microscopic origin of net magnetization in the\nspin-1 trimer chain compound CaNi3P4O14 have been investigated by powder\nneutron diffraction. The present study reveals a 3D long-range magnetic\nordering below 16 K where the magnetic structure consists of ferromagnetic\ntrimers that are coupled ferromagnetically along the spin-chain. The moment\ncomponents along the a and c axes arrange antiferromagnetically. Our study\nestablishes that the uncompensated moment components along the b axis result in\na net magnetization per unit cell. The magnetic structure, determined in the\npresent study, is in agreement with the results of recent first principles\ncalculation; however, it is in contrast to a fascinating experimental\nprediction of ferrimagnetic ordering based on the periodicity of the exchange\ninteractions in CaNi3P4O14. Our study also confirms the presence of broad\ndiffuse magnetic scattering, due to 1D short-range spin-spin correlations, over\na wide temperature range below ~50 K down to a temperature well below the Tc.\nTotal neutron scattering analysis by the RMC method reveals that the dominating\nspin-spin correlation above Tc is ferromagnetic and along the b axis. The\nnearest neighbour spin-spin correlations along the a and c axes are found to be\nweakly antiferromagnetic. The nature of the trimer spin structure of the\nshort-range state is similar to that of the 3D long-range ordered state. The\npresent investigation of microscopic nature of the magnetic ground state also\nexplains the condition required for the 1/3 magnetization plateau to be\nobserved in the trimer spin-chains. In spite of the S=1 trimer chain system,\nthe present compound CaNi3P4O14 is found to be a good realization of 3D magnet\nbelow the Tc=16 K with full ordered moment values of ~2 mu_B/Ni2+ (1.98 and\n1.96 mu_B/Ni2+ for two Ni sites, respectively) at 1.5 K.\n", "  We investigate the magnetic properties of quark matter in the inhomogeneous\nchiral phase, where both scalar and pseudoscalar condensates spatially\nmodulate. The energy spectrum of the lowest Landau level becomes asymmetric\nabout zero in the external magnetic field, and gives rise to the remarkably\nmagnetic properties: quark matter has a spontaneous magnetization, while the\nmagnetic susceptibility does not diverge on the critical point.\n", "  Transpolar arcs and cusp spots are both auroral phenomena which occur when\nthe interplanetary magnetic field is northward. Transpolar arcs are associated\nwith magnetic reconnection in the magnetotail, which closes magnetic flux and\nresults in a \"wedge\" of closed flux which remains trapped, embedded in the\nmagnetotail lobe. The cusp spot is an indicator of lobe reconnection at the\nhigh-latitude magnetopause; in its simplest case, lobe reconnection\nredistributes open flux without resulting in any net change in the open flux\ncontent of the magnetosphere. We present observations of the two phenomena\ninteracting--i.e., a transpolar arc intersecting a cusp spot during part of its\nlifetime. The significance of this observation is that lobe reconnection can\nhave the effect of opening closed magnetotail flux. We argue that such events\nshould not be rare.\n", "  Oxides with good p-type conductivity have been long sought after to achieve\nhigh performance all-oxide optoelectronic devices. Divalent Sn(II) based oxides\nare promising candidates because of their rather dispersive upper valence bands\ncaused by the Sn-5s/O-2p anti-bonding hybridization. There are so far few known\nSn(II) oxides being p-type conductive suitable for device applications. Here,\nwe present via first-principles global optimization structure searches a\nmaterial design study for a hitherto unexplored Sn(II)-based system, ternary\nalkaline-earth metal Sn(II) oxides in the stoichiometry of MSn2O3 (M = Mg, Ca,\nSr, Ba). We identify two stable compounds of SrSn2O3 and BaSn2O3, which can be\nstabilized by Sn-rich conditions in phase stability diagrams. Their structures\nfollow the Zintl behaviour and consist of basic structural motifs of SnO3\ntetrahedra. Unexpectedly they show distinct electronic properties with band\ngaps ranging from 1.90 (BaSn2O3) to 3.15 (SrSn2O3) eV, and hole effective\nmasses ranging from 0.87 (BaSn2O3) to above 6.0 (SrSn2O3) m0. Further\nexploration of metastable phases indicates a wide tunability of electronic\nproperties controlled by the details of the bonding between the basic\nstructural motifs. This suggests further exploration of alkaline-earth metal\nSn(II) oxides for potential applications requiring good p-type conductivity\nsuch as transparent conductors and photovoltaic absorbers.\n", "  Fewest-switches surface hopping is studied in the context of\nquantum-classical Liouville dynamics. Both approaches are mixed\nquantum-classical theories that provide a way to describe and simulate the\nnonadiabatic quantum dynamics of many-body systems. Starting from a\nsurface-hopping solution of the quantum-classical Liouville equation, it is\nshown how fewest-switches dynamics can be obtained by dropping terms that are\nresponsible for decoherence and restricting the nuclear momentum changes that\naccompany electronic transitions to those events that occur between population\nstates. The analysis provides information on some of the elements that are\nessential for the construction of accurate and computationally tractable\nalgorithms for nonadiabatic processes.\n", "  \"Negative energy\" has been one of the most enduring puzzles in quantum\ntheory, whereas the present work reveals that it actually plays a central role\nin clarifying various controversies of quantum theory. The basic idea is\ncontained in a hypothesis on negative energy, and it is shown that the idea:\n(1)is compatible with both relativistic quantum mechanics and known\nexperimental results; (2)helps to clarify the essence of matter waves, and\ntherefore better understand the reality of the wave function, the so-called\n'wave-packet reduction' occurring in quantum measurement, and the ghost like\ncorrelations between entangled systems; (3)is helpful for distinguishing the\nvacuum from the ground state of the quantized field, and may supply a possible\nway for removing the deep-rooted infinities in quantum field theory. The vacuum\nenergy density of the electromagnetic field is calculated here as an example.\nBy employing the same idea, the Lamb-Shift is recalculated in a different way\nfrom conventional renormalization method, yet the same result as Bethe's can be\ndefinitely obtained.\n", "  The term \"butterfly effect\" means an extreme sensitivity of a dynamical\nsystem to small perturbations: \"The beating of a butterfly wing in South\nAmerica can result in the considerable change of positions and force of a\ntropical cyclon in Atlantic 2 weeks later\". Numerical simulations of R.Robert\nshow the absence of the butterfly effect in some simple flows of 2-d ideal\nincompressible fluid which is a model of the atmosphere. In this work a more\ncomplicated flow is considered. Numerical simulation demonstrates the butterfly\neffect in the strongest form. The effect is robust, and the experiment is 100%\nreproducible.\n", "  We are interested in investigating the growth of structures at the nonlinear\nscales of galaxy clusters from an observational perspective: we explore the\npossibility of measuring the mass accretion rate of galaxy clusters from their\nmass profile beyond the virial radius. We derive the accretion rate from the\nmass of a spherical shell whose infall velocity is extracted from $N$-body\nsimulations. In the redshift range $z=[0,2]$, our prescription returns an\naverage mass accretion rate within $20-40 \\%$ of the average rate derived from\nthe merger trees of dark matter haloes extracted from $N$-body simulations. Our\nresult suggests that measuring the mean mass accretion rate of a sample of\ngalaxy clusters is actually feasible, thus providing a new potential\nobservational test of the cosmological and structure formation models.\n", "  One-way quantum computation, also known as Cluster State Quantum Computation,\nprovides a robust and efficient tool to perform universal quantum computation\nusing only single-qubit projective measurements, given a highly entangled\ncluster state. The cluster-state approach to quantum computation also leads to\ncertain practical advantages such as robustness against errors. In this paper,\nwe propose a SAW-driven One-Way Quantum Computation approach that is realizable\nusing a mentioned architecture and elements.\n", "  We have experimentally demonstrated the all-fiber generation of 1.3-{\\mu}m\nfemtosecond pulses via Cherenkov radiation (CR) from an ultrafast Er-doped\nfiber laser. The experiment shows that the pulses maintain below 40 fs in the\nrange from 1270 to 1315 nm with multi-milliwatt average output power. The\nshortest generated pulses can be as short as 29 fs. This ultrashort pulse\nsource in 1.3-{\\mu}m window can bring the benefits to many fields such as the\nbio-imaging and the ultrafast spectroscopy, and so on.\n", "  The determination of the parton distribution functions (PDFs) of the proton\nwill be an essential input for the physics program of a future 100 TeV hadron\ncollider. The unprecedented center-of-mass energy will require knowledge of\nPDFs in currently unexplored kinematical regions such as the ultra low-x region\nor the region of multi-TeV momentum transfers. In this contribution we briefly\nsummarise the studies presented in the PDF section of the upcoming report on\n\"Physics at a 100 TeV pp collider: Standard Model processes\". First we map the\nPDF kinematical coverage in the $(x,Q^2)$ plane, quantify PDF uncertainties,\nand compute ratios of PDF luminosities between 100 TeV and 14 TeV. Then we show\nhow the extreme kinematics of such collider lead to a number of remarkable\nPDF-related phenomena such as the top quark as a massless parton, an increased\nrole of photon-initiated processes and the possible need of PDFs with\nhigh-energy resummation.\n", "  Increasing sensitivity and signal to noise ratios of conventional wave\nsensors is an interesting topic in structural health monitoring, medical\nimaging, aerospace and nuclear instrumentation. Here, we report the concept of\na gradient piezoelectric self-sensing system by integrating shunting circuitry\ninto conventional sensors. By tuning circuit elements properly, both the\nquality and quantity of the flexural wave measurement data can be significantly\nincreased for new adaptive sensing applications. Through analytical, numerical\nand experimental studies, we demonstrate that the metamaterial-based sensing\nsystem (MBSS) with gradient bending stiffness can be designed by connecting\ngradient negative capacitance circuits to an array of piezoelectric patches\n(sensors). We further demonstrate that the proposed system can achieve more\nthan two orders of magnitude amplification of flexural wave signals to overcome\nthe detection limit. This research encompasses fundamental advancements in the\nMBSS with improved performance and functionalities, and will yield significant\nadvances for a range of applications.\n", "  We develop a gravitational analogue of spin magnetic resonance, called spin\ngravitational resonance, whereby a gravitational wave interacts with a magnetic\nfield to produce a spin transition. In particular, an external magnetic field\nseparates the energy spin states of a spin-1/2 particle, and the presence of\nthe gravitational wave produces a perturbation in the components of the\nmagnetic field orthogonal to the gravitational wave propagation. In this\nframework we test Dyson's conjecture that individual gravitons cannot be\ndetected. Although we find no fundamental laws preventing single gravitons\nbeing detected with spin gravitational resonance, we show that it cannot be\nused in practice, in support of Dyson's conjecture.\n", "  The L1544 prestellar core has been observed as part of the ASAI IRAM Large\nProgram at 3 mm. These observations led to the detection of many complex\nmolecules. In this Letter, we report the detection of two lines, at 85.5 GHz\n(4,0,4-3,0,3) and 106.9 GHz (5,0,5-4,0,4), respectively, of the protonated\ncarbon dioxide ion, HOCO+. We also report the tentative detection of the line\nat 100.4 GHz (5,0,5-4,0,4) of DOCO+. The non-LTE analysis of the detected lines\nshows that the HOCO+ emission originates in the external layer where\nnon-thermal desorption of other species has previously been observed. Its\nabundance is (5 +/- 2) e-11. Modelling of the chemistry involved in the\nformation and destruction of HOCO+ provides a gaseous CO2 abundance of 2e-7\n(with respect to H2) with an upper limit of 2e-6.\n", "  We have developed a computationally competitive N-body model of a\nprevirialized aggregation of galaxies in a flat LambdaCDM universe to assess\nthe role of the multiple mergers that take place during the formation stage of\nsuch systems in the configuration of the remnants assembled at their centres.\nAn analysis of a suite of 48 simulations of low-mass forming groups (of about\n1E13 solar masses) demonstrates that the gravitational dynamics involved in\ntheir hierarchical collapse is capable of creating realistic first-ranked\ngalaxies without the aid of dissipative processes. Our simulations indicate\nthat the brightest group galaxies (BGGs) constitute a distinct population from\nother group members, sketching a scenario in which the assembly path of these\nobjects is dictated largely by the formation of their host system. We detect\nsignificant differences in the distribution of Sersic indices and total\nmagnitudes, as well as a luminosity gap between BGGs and the next brightest\ngalaxy that is positively correlated with the total luminosity of the parent\ngroup. Such gaps arise from both the grow of BGGs at the expense of lesser\ncompanions and the decrease in the relevance of second-ranked objects in equal\nmeasure. This results in a dearth of intermediate-mass galaxies which explains\nthe characteristic central dip detected in their luminosity functions in\ndynamically young galaxy aggregations. The fact that the basic global\nproperties of our BGGs define a thin mass fundamental plane strikingly similar\nto that followed giant early-type galaxies in the local universe reinforces\nconfidence in the results obtained.\n", "  The quantum metric tensor was introduced for defining the distance in the\nparameter space of a system. However, it is also useful for other purposes,\nlike predicting quantum phase transitions. Due to the physical information this\ntensor provides, its gauge independence sounds reasonable. More over, its\noriginal construction was made by looking for this gauge independence. The aim\nof this paper, however, is to prove that the quantum metric tensor does depend\non the gauge. In addition, a real gauge invariant quantum metric tensor is\nintroduced. In this paper, the gauge dependence is explicitly shown by\ncomputing the quantum metric tensor of the Landau problem in different gauges.\nThen, a real gauge independent metric tensor is proposed and computed for the\nsame Landau problem. Since the gauge dependence has not been observed before,\nthe results of this paper might lead to a new study of topics that were\nbelieved to be completely understood.\n", "  A two-level atom coupled to the radiation field is studied. First principles\nin physics suggest that the coupling function, representing the interaction\nbetween the atom and the radiation field, behaves like $\\vert k \\vert^{- 1/2}$,\nas the photon momentum k tends to zero. Previous results on non-existence of\nground state eigenvalues suggest that in the most general case binding does not\noccur in the spin-boson model, i.e., the minimal energy of the atom-photon\nsystem is not an eigenvalue of the energy operator. Hasler and Herbst have\nshown [12], however, that under the additional hypothesis that the coupling\nfunction be off-diagonal -which is customary to assume-binding does indeed\noccur. In this paper an alternative proof of binding in case of off-diagonal\ncoupling is given, i.e., it is proven that, if the coupling function is\noff-diagonal, the ground state energy of the spin-boson model is an eigenvalue\nof the Hamiltonian. We develop a multiscale method that can be applied in the\nsituation we study, identifying a new key symmetry operator which we use to\ndemonstrate that the most singular terms appearing in the multiscale analysis\nvanish.\n", "  Measurement of the fusion cross-section for neutron-rich light nuclei is\ncrucial in ascertaining if fusion of these nuclei occurs in the outer crust of\na neutron star. We have therefore measured the fusion excitation function at\nnear-barrier energies for the 19O + 12C system and compared the experimental\nresults with the fusion excitation function of 18O + 12C and 16O + 12C. In the\nexperiment a beam of 19O, produced via the 18O(d,p) reaction, was incident on a\n12C target at energies near the Coulomb barrier. Evaporation residues produced\nin fusion of 18,19O ions with 12C target nuclei were detected with good\ngeometric efficiency and identified by measuring their energy and\ntime-of-flight. A significant enhancement in the fusion probability of 19O ions\nwith a 12C target as compared to 18O ions is observed. The significantly larger\ncross-sections observed at near barrier energies are not predicted by a static\nmodel of fusion for 19O + 12C indicating that dynamics play an important role\nin the fusion of neutron-rich light nuclei.\n", "  In this paper, we attempt to find out the `spectro-temporal' characteristics\nduring the jet ejection, of several outbursting Galactic black hole sources\nbased on RXTE-PCA/HEXTE data in the energy band of 2 - 100 keV. We present\nresults of detailed analysis of these sources during the rising phase of their\noutburst, whenever simultaneous or near-simultaneous X-ray and Radio\nobservations are `available'. We find that before the peak radio flare\n(transient jet) a few of the sources (in addition to those reported earlier)\nexhibit `local' softening within the soft intermediate state itself. Except the\nduration, all the properties of the `local' softening (QPO not observed,\nreduction in total rms, soft spectra) are observed to be similar to the\ncanonical soft state. We find similar `local' softening for the recent outburst\nof V404 Cyg also based on SWIFT observations. Fast changes in the\n`spectro-temporal' properties during the `local' softening implies that it may\nnot be occurring due to change in Keplerian accretion rate. We discuss these\nresults in the framework of the magnetized two component advective flow model.\n", "  Understanding how the mechanism of charge transport through molecular tunnel\njunctions depends on temperature is crucial to control electronic function in\nmolecular electronic devices. With just a few systems investigated as a\nfunction of bias and temperature so far, thermal effects in molecular tunnel\njunctions remain poorly understood. Here we report a detailed charge transport\nstudy of an individual redox-active ferrocene-based molecule over a wide range\nof temperatures and applied potentials. The results show the temperature\ndependence of the current to vary strongly as a function of the gate voltage.\nSpecifically, the current across the molecule exponentially increases in the\nCoulomb blockade regime and decreases at the charge degeneracy points, while\nremaining temperature-independent at resonance. Our observations can be well\naccounted for by a formal single-level tunneling model where the temperature\ndependence relies on the thermal broadening of the Fermi distributions of the\nelectrons in the leads.\n", "  To study the performance of multi-threaded Geant4 for high-energy physics\nexperiments, an application has been developed which generalizes and extends\nprevious work. A highly-complex detector geometry is used for benchmarking on\nan Intel Xeon Phi coprocessor. In addition, an implementation of parallel I/O\nbased on Intel SCIF and ROOT technologies is incorporated and studied.\n", "  We have determined the interstellar spectra of cosmic ray protons and\nelectrons from a few MeV to ~10 GeV. These interstellar spectra are based on\nVoyager data and a normalization of specific galactic propagation model\ncalculations of both protons and electrons to PAMELA data at the Earth at 10\nGeV, where the solar modulation is small. These resulting interstellar spectra\nare then compared with spectra of protons and electrons measured at lower\nenergies at the Earth by PAMELA in 2009. The total amount of modulation at\nlower rigidities (energies) is found to be nearly the same at the same rigidity\nfor both protons and electrons and ranges in magnitude from a factor ~400 at\n0.1 GV for electrons, to a factor ~15 at 0.44 GV (100 MeV for protons), to a\nfactor ~3.3 at 1 GV for both components. The magnitude of this total modulation\nof both components are the same to within + 10% from ~0.3 to ~3 GV in rigidity.\nThe observed total modulation for protons can be matched quite closely using a\nsimple spherically symmetric modulation picture involving a force field model\nfor the modulation and a constant energy loss at all energies. The electrons\nrequire a set of parameters to calculate more detailed features of the\nmodulation using the diffusion coefficient and its variation with rigidity and\nradius at rigidities less than few GV.\n", "  Properties of engineering materials are generally influenced by defects such\nas point defects (vacancies, interstitials, substitutional defects), line\ndefects (dislocations), planar defects (grain boundaries, free\nsurfaces/nanostructures, interfaces, stacking faults) and volume defects\n(voids). Classical physics based molecular dynamics and quantum physics based\ndensity functional theory can be useful in designing materials with controlled\ndefect properties. In this thesis, empirical potential based molecular dynamics\nwas used to study the surface modification of polymers due to energetic\npolyatomic ion, thermodynamics and mechanics of metal-ceramic interfaces and\nnanostructures, while density functional theory was used to screen substituents\nin optoelectronic materials.\n", "  In this paper, the mechanical properties of two-dimensional structures of\nmetal decoration systems of simple graphyne (CC), analogous system of BN sheet\n(BN-yne), also the graphyne-BN sheet (CC-BN-yne) was investigated. The\nproperties such as Young and Bulk moduli were studied using Energy-Strain\ncorrelation. We introduced calculations based on density functional theory\n(DFT); the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) framework was used in this\nregard. The results demonstrated very competitive values for Young and Bulk\nmoduli of the Pt decorated CC and BN-yne. However, the CC-BN-yne structure\ndefined around 80% of Young and 77% of Bulk values of that of pure structures.\nAlso Na decorated ones were examined and the results showed the same trend for\nall three structures. The CC-BN-yne defined the lowest values for either Young\nor Bulk moduli.\n", "  We present results on the fourth-order splitting functions and coefficient\nfunctions obtained using Forcer, a four-loop generalization of the Mincer\nprogram for the parametric reduction of self-energy integrals. We have computed\nthe respective lowest three even-N and odd-N moments for the non-singlet\nsplitting functions and the non-singlet coefficient functions in\nelectromagnetic and nu+nu(bar) charged-current deep-inelastic scattering, and\nthe N=2 and N=4 results for the corresponding flavour-singlet quantities.\nEnough moments have been obtained for an LLL-based determination of the\nanalytic N-dependence of the nf^3 and nf^2 parts, respectively, of the singlet\nand non-singlet splitting functions. The large-N limit of the latter provides\nthe complete nf^2 contributions to the four-loop cusp anomalous dimension. Our\nresults also provide additional evidence of a non-vanishing contribution of\nquartic group invariants to the cusp anomalous dimension.\n", "  We propose evolution rules of the multiagent network and determine\nstatistical patterns in life cycle of agents - information messages. The main\ndiscussed statistical pattern is connected with the number of likes and reposts\nfor a message. This distribution corresponds to Weibull distribution according\nto modeling results. We examine proposed model using the data from Twitter, an\nonline social networking service.\n", "  What drives the propensity for the social network dynamics? Social influence\nis believed to drive both off-line and on-line human behavior, however it has\nnot been considered as a driver of social network evolution. Our analysis\nsuggest that, while the network structure affects the spread of influence in\nsocial networks, the network is in turn shaped by social influence activity\n(i.e., the process of social influence wherein one person's attitudes and\nbehaviors affect another's). To that end, we develop a novel model of network\nevolution where the dynamics of network follow the mechanism of influence\npropagation, which are not captured by the existing network evolution models.\nOur experiments confirm the predictions of our model and demonstrate the\nimportant role that social influence can play in the process of network\nevolution. As well exploring the reason of social network evolution, different\ngenres of social influence have been spotted having different effects on the\nnetwork dynamics. These findings and methods are essential to both our\nunderstanding of the mechanisms that drive network evolution and our knowledge\nof the role of social influence in shaping the network structure.\n", "  In order to have a new perspective on the long-standing problem of the mass\ngap in Yang-Mills theory, we study the quantum Yang-Mills theory in the\npresence of topologically nontrivial backgrounds in this paper. The\ntopologically stable gauge fields are constrained by the form invariance\ncondition and the topological properties. Obeying these constraints, the known\nclassical solutions to the Yang-Mills equation in the 3- and 4-dimensional\nEuclidean spaces are recovered, and the other allowed configurations form the\nnontrivial topological fluctuations at quantum level. Together, they constitute\nthe background configurations, upon which the quantum Yang-Mills theory can be\nconstructed. We demonstrate that the theory mimics the Higgs mechanism in a\ncertain limit and develops a mass gap at semi-classical level on a flat space\nwith finite size or on a sphere.\n", "  We analyse the interaction between charges and graphene layers. The electric\npolarisability of graphene induces a force, that can be described by an image\ncharge. The analysis shows that graphene can be described as an imperfect\nconductor with a finite dielectric constant, $\\epsilon_r$, for weak coupling,\nand it behaves as a metal for strong fields. As a consequence, the interaction\nbetween polar molecules and graphene layer(s) tends to align the molecular\ndipole along the direction normal to the graphene, and quantitative estimates\nof the energy gain are given The strength of this interaction can be sufficient\nto overcome thermal effects when the molecule is close to the layer, even at\nroom temperature. Hence, boundary effects play a significant role in\ndetermining the structure of systems such as water confined in atomically\nnarrow van der Waals heterostructures.\n", "  A variational model for epitaxially strained films accounting for the\npresence of dislocations is considered. Existence, regularity and some\nqualitative properties of solutions are addressed.\n"]}
