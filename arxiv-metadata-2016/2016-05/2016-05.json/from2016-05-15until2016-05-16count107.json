Here we experimentally demonstrate, both in the quantum\ncircuit model and in the one-way quantum computer model, the smallest\nnon-trivial quantum codes to tackle this problem. In the experiment, we encode\nsingle-qubit input states into highly-entangled multiparticle codewords, and we\ntest their ability to protect encoded quantum information from detected\none-qubit loss error. Our results prove the in-principle feasibility of\novercoming the qubit loss error by quantum codes.\n", "  In controlled X-ray irradiation experiments, the formation of trap states in\nthe prototypical van der Waals bonded semiconductor Rubrene is studied\nquantitatively for doses up to 82 Gy (Gy = J/kg). About 100 electronic trap\nstates, located around 0.3 eV above the valence band, are created by each\nabsorbed 8 keV photon which is 2-3 orders of magnitude more than 1 MeV protons\nproduce. Thermal annealing is shown to reduce these traps. Local structural\ndisorder, which has also been induced by other means in different studies, is\nthus identified as a common origin of trap states in van der Waals bonded\nmolecular organic semiconductors.\n", "  Finite renormalization freedom in locally covariant quantum field theories on\ncurved spacetime is known to be tightly constrained, under certain standard\nhypotheses, to the same terms as in flat spacetime up to finitely many\ncurvature dependent terms. These hypotheses include, in particular, locality,\ncovariance, scaling, microlocal regularity and continuous and analytic\ndependence on the metric and coupling parameters. The analytic dependence\nhypothesis is somewhat unnatural, because it requires that locally covariant\nobservables (which are simultaneously defined on all spacetimes) depend\ncontinuously on an arbitrary metric, with the dependence strengthened to\nanalytic on analytic metrics. Moreover the fact that analytic metrics are\nglobally rigid makes the implementation of this requirement at the level of\nlocal $*$-algebras of observables rather technically cumbersome. We show that\nthe conditions of locality, covariance, scaling and a naturally strengthened\nmicrolocal spectral condition, are actually sufficient to constrain the allowed\nfinite renormalizations equally strongly, thus eliminating both the continuity\nand the somewhat unnatural analyticity hypotheses. The key step in the proof\nuses the Peetre-Slov\\'ak theorem on the characterization of (in general\nnon-linear) differential operators by their locality and regularity properties.\n", "  The validity of the Parisi formula in the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model (SK)\nwas initially proved by Talagrand [18]. The central argument therein relied on\na very dedicated study of the coupled free energy via the two-dimensional\nGuerra-Talagrand (GT) replica symmetry breaking bound. It is believed that this\nbound and its higher dimensional generalization are highly related to the\nconjectures of temperature chaos and ultrametricity in the SK model, but a\ncomplete investigation remains elusive. Motivated by Bovier-Klimovsky [2] and\nAuffinger-Chen [3], the aim of this paper is to present a novel approach to\nanalyzing the Parisi functional and the two-dimensional GT bound in the mixed\n$p$-spin models in terms of optimal stochastic control problems. We compute the\ndirectional derivative of the Parisi functional and derive equivalent criteria\nfor the Parisi measure. We demonstrate how our approach provides a simple and\nefficient control for the GT bound that yields several new results on\nTalagrand's positivity of the overlap [20,Section 14.12] and disorder chaos in\nChatterjee [5] and Chen [6]. In particular, we provide some examples of the\nmodels containing odd $p$-spin interactions.\n", "  We consider a chain of anharmonic oscillators immersed in a heat bath with a\ntemperature gradient and a time varying tension applied to one end of the chain\nwhile the other side is fixed to a point. We prove that under diffusive\nspace-time rescaling the volume strain distribution of the chain evolves\nfollowing a non-linear diffusive equation. The stationary states of the\ndynamics are of non-equilibrium and have a positive entropy production, so the\nclassical relative entropy methods cannot be used. We develop new estimates\nbased on entropic hypocoercivity, that allows to control the distribution of\nthe positions configurations of the chain. The macroscopic limit can be used to\nmodel isothermal thermodynamic transformations between non-equilibrium\nstationary states.\n", "  A search for a massive resonance decaying into a standard-model-like Higgs\nboson (H) and a W or Z boson is reported. The analysis is performed on a data\nsample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 inverse femtobarns,\ncollected in proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV with\nthe CMS detector at the LHC. Signal events, in which the decay products of\nHiggs, W, or Z bosons at high Lorentz boost are contained within single\nreconstructed jets, are identified using jet substructure techniques, including\nthe tagging of b hadrons. This is the first search for heavy resonances\ndecaying into HW or HZ resulting in an all-jet final state, as well as the\nfirst application of jet substructure techniques to identify H to WW* to 4q\ndecays at high Lorentz boost. No significant signal is observed and limits are\nset at 95% confidence level on the production cross section of W' and Z' in a\nmodel with mass-degenerate charged and neutral spin-1 resonances. Resonance\nmasses are excluded for W' in the interval [1.0, 1.6] TeV, for Z' in the\nintervals [1.0, 1.1] and [1.3, 1.5] TeV, and for mass-degenerate W' and Z' in\nthe interval [1.0, 1.7] TeV.\n", "  The origin of the suppression of the longitudinal spin Seebeck effect by\napplied magnetic fields is studied. We perform numerical simulations of the\nstochastic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation of motion for an atomistic spin\nmodel and calculate the magnon accumulation in linear temperature gradients for\ndifferent strengths of applied magnetic fields and different length scales of\nthe temperature gradient. We observe a decrease of the magnon accumulation with\nincreasing magnetic field and we reveal that the origin of this effect is a\nfield dependent change of the frequency distribution of the propagating\nmagnons. With increasing field the magnonic spin currents are reduced due to a\nsuppression of parts of the frequency spectrum. By comparison with measurements\nof the magnetic field dependent longitudinal spin Seebeck effect in YIG thin\nfilms with various thicknesses, we find that our model describes the\nexperimental data very well, demonstrating the importance of this effect for\nexperimental systems.\n", "  We demonstrate heralded qubit amplification for Time-Bin and Fock-state\nqubits in an all-fibre, telecom-wavelength, scheme that highlights the\nsimplicity, the stability and potential for fully integrated photonic\nsolutions. Exploiting high-efficiency superconducting detectors, the gain, the\nfidelity and the performance of the amplifier are studied as a function of\nloss. We also demonstrate the first heralded Fock-state qubit amplifier without\npost-selection. This provides a significant advance towards demonstrating\nDevice-Independent Quantum Key Distribution as well as fundamental tests of\nquantum mechanics over extended distances.\n", "  Biological aggregations such as insect swarms and bird flocks may arise from\na combination of social interactions and environmental cues. We focus on\nnonlocal continuum equations, which are often used to model aggregations, and\nyet which pose significant analytical and computational challenges. Beginning\nwith a particular nonlocal aggregation model [Topaz et al., Bull. Math. Bio.,\n2006], we derive the minimal well-posed long-wave approximation, which is a\ndegenerate Cahn-Hilliard equation. Energy minimizers of this reduced, local\nmodel retain many salient features of those of the nonlocal model, especially\nfor large populations and away from an aggregation's boundaries. Using the\nCahn-Hilliard model as a testbed, we investigate the degree to which an\nexternal potential modeling food sources can be used to suppress peak\npopulation density, which is essential for controlling locust outbreaks. A\nrandom distribution of food sources tends to increase peak density above its\nintrinsic value, while a periodic pattern of food sources can decrease it.\n", "  We propose a scenario of brane cosmology in which the Peccei-Quinn field\nplays the role of the inflaton and solves simultaneously many cosmological and\nphenomenological issues such as the generation of a heavy Majorana mass for the\nright-handed neutrinos needed for seesaw mechanism, MSSM $\\mu$-parameter, the\nright amount of baryon number asymmetry and dark matter relic density at the\npresent universe, together with an axion solution to the strong CP problem\nwithout the domain wall obstacle. Interestingly, the scales of the soft\nSUSY-breaking mass parameter and that of the breaking of $U(1)_{\\rm PQ}$\nsymmetry are lower bounded at $\\mathcal{O}(10) {\\mathrm TeV}$ and\n$\\mathcal{O}(10^{11}) {\\mathrm GeV}$, respectively.\n", "  Collapse models postulate the existence of intrinsic noise which modifies\nquantum mechanics and is responsible for the emergence of macroscopic\nclassicality. Assessing the validity of these models is extremely challenging\nbecause it is nontrivial to discriminate unambiguously their presence in\nexperiments where other hardly controllable sources of noise compete to the\noverall decoherence. Here we provide a simple procedure able to probe the\nhypothetical presence of the collapse noise with a levitated nanosphere in a\nFabry-Perot cavity. We show that the stationary state of the system is\nparticularly sensitive, under specific experimental conditions, to the\ninterplay between the trapping frequency, the cavity size, and the momentum\ndiffusion induced by the collapse models, allowing to detect them even in the\npresence of standard environmental noises.\n", "  We investigate the phase diagram of the cross-coupled Heisenberg spin ladder\nwith antiferromagnetic couplings. For this model there have been conflicting\nresults for the existence of the columnar dimer phase, which was predicted on\nthe basis of weak coupling field theory renormalisation group arguments. The\nnumerical work on this model has been based on various approaches, including\nexact diagonalization, series expansions and density-matrix renormalization\ngroup calculations. Using the recently developed tensor network states and\nground-state fidelity approach for quantum spin ladders we find no evidence for\nthe existence of the columnar dimer phase. We also provide an argument based on\nthe symmetry of the Hamiltonian which suggests that the phase diagram for\nantiferromagnetic couplings consists of a single line separating the\nrung-singlet and Haldane phases.\n", "  We report experimental and numerical results on the buildup of the energy\nspectrum in wave turbulence of a vibrating thin elastic plate. Three steps are\nobserved: first a short linear stage, then the turbulent spectrum is\nconstructed by the propagation of a front in wave number space and finally a\nlong time saturation due to the action of dissipation. The propagation of a\nfront at the second step is compatible with scaling predictions from the Weak\nTurbulence Theory.\n", "  The spin-conserving length-scale is a key parameter determining\nfunctionalities of a broad range of spintronic devices including magnetic\nmultilayer spin-valves in the commercialized magnetic memories or lateral spin\ntransistors in experimental spin-logic elements. Spatially resolved optical\npump-and-probe experiments in the lateral devices allow for the direct\nmeasurement of the lengthscale and the time-scale at which spin-information is\ntransferred from the injector to the detector. Using this technique, we\ndemonstrate that in an undoped GaAs/AlGaAs layer spins are detected at\ndistances reaching more than ten microns from the injection point at times as\nshort as nanoseconds after the pump-pulse. The observed unique combination of\nthe long-range and highrate electronic spin-transport requires simultaneous\nsuppression of mechanisms limiting the spin life-time and mobility of carriers.\nUnlike earlier attempts focusing on elaborate doping, gating, or\nheterostructures we demonstrate that the bare GaAs/AlGaAs layer intrinsically\nprovides superior spin-transport characteristics whether deposited directly on\nthe substrate or embedded in complex heterostructures.\n", "  Quantum mechanics predicts microscopic phenomena with undeniable success.\nNevertheless, current theoretical and experimental efforts still do not yield\nconclusive evidence that there is, or not, a fundamental limitation on the\npossibility to observe quantum phenomena at the macroscopic scale. This\nquestion prompted several experimental efforts producing quantum superpositions\nof large quantum states in light or matter. Here we report on the observation\nof entanglement between a single photon and an atomic ensemble. The certified\nentanglement stems from a light-matter micro-macro entangled state that\ninvolves the superposition of two macroscopically distinguishable solid-state\ncomponents composed of several tens of atomic excitations. Our approach\nleverages from quantum memory techniques and could be used in other systems to\nexpand the size of quantum superpositions in matter.\n", "  Despite significant progress in resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS)\nexperiments on cuprates at the Cu L-edge, a theoretical understanding of the\ncross-section remains incomplete in terms of elementary excitations and the\nconnection to both charge and spin structure factors. Here we use\nstate-of-the-art, unbiased numerical calculations to study the low energy\nexcitations probed by RIXS in undoped and doped Hubbard model relevant to the\ncuprates. The results highlight the importance of scattering geometry, in\nparticular both the incident and scattered x-ray photon polarization, and\ndemonstrate that on a qualitative level the RIXS spectral shape in the\ncross-polarized channel approximates that of the spin dynamical structure\nfactor. However, in the parallel-polarized channel the complexity of the RIXS\nprocess beyond a simple two-particle response complicates the analysis, and\ndemonstrates that approximations and expansions which attempt to relate RIXS to\nless complex correlation functions can not reproduce the full diversity of RIXS\nspectral features.\n", "  We show that materials made of scatterers distributed on a stealth\nhyperuniform point pattern can be transparent at densities for which an\nuncorrelated disordered material would be opaque due to multiple scattering.\nThe conditions for transparency are analyzed using numerical simulations, and\nan explicit criterion is found based on a perturbative theory. The broad\napplicability of the concept offers perspectives for various applications in\nphotonics, and more generally in wave physics.\n", "  Let $(X,T)$ be a dynamical system where $X$ is a compact metric space and\n$T:X\\rightarrow X$ is continuous and invertible. Assume the Lebesgue covering\ndimension of $X$ is $d$. We show that for a generic continuous map\n$h:X\\rightarrow[0,1]$, the $(2d+1)$-delay observation map\n$x\\mapsto\\big(h(x),h(Tx),\\ldots,h(T^{2d}x)\\big)$ is an embedding of $X$ inside\n$[0,1]^{2d+1}$. This is a generalization of the discrete version of the\ncelebrated Takens embedding theorem, as proven by Sauer, Yorke and Casdagli to\nthe setting of a continuous observable. In particular there is no assumption on\nthe (lower) box-counting dimension of $X$ which may be infinite.\n", "  Light emitters or scatterers embedded in stratified media may couple energy\nto both free space modes and guided modes of the stratified structure. For a\ncomprehensive analysis, it is important to evaluate the angular intensity\ndistribution of both the free-space modes and guided modes excited in such\nsystems. In the present work, we propose an original method based on\nLorentz-reciprocity theorem to efficiently calculate the free-space and guided\nradiation diagrams with a high accuracy from the sole knowledge of the\nnear-field around the emitters or scatterers. Compared to conventional\nnear-to-far field transformation techniques, the proposal allows one to easily\nevaluate the guided-mode radiation diagrams, even if material dissipation is\npresent in the stack, and thus to simultaneously track the coupling of light to\nall channels (i.e., free-space and guided-ones). We also provide an open-source\ncode that may be used with essentially any Maxwell's equation solver. The\nnumerical tool may help to engineer various devices, such as light-emitting\ndiodes or nanoantennas to achieve directional and efficient radiative\nspontaneous decays in free space and guided optics.\n", "  We consider the $O(N+1)/O(N)$ Non-Linear Sigma Model for large $N$ as an\neffective theory for low-energy QCD at finite temperature $T$, in the chiral\nlimit. At $T=0$ this formulation provides a good description of scattering data\nin the scalar channel and generates dynamically the $f_0(500)$ pole, the pole\nposition lying within experimental determinations. Previous $T=0$ results with\nthis model are updated using newer analysis of pion scattering data. We\ncalculate the pion scattering amplitude at finite $T$ and show that it\nsatisfies exactly thermal unitarity, which had been assumed but not formally\nproven in previous works. We discuss the main differences with the $T=0$ result\nand we show that one can define a proper renormalization scheme with $T=0$\ncounterterms such that the renormalized amplitude can be chosen to depend only\non a few parameters. Next, we analyze the behaviour of the $f_0(500)$ pole at\nfinite $T$, which is consistent with chiral symmetry restoration when the\nscalar susceptibility is saturated by the $f_0(500)$ state, in a second-order\ntransition scenario and in accordance with lattice and theoretical analysis.\n", "  Under very general assumptions of metric theory of spacetime, photons\ntraveling along null geodesics and photon number conservation, two observable\nconcepts of cosmic distance, i.e. the angular diameter and the luminosity\ndistances are related to each other by the so-called distance duality relation\n(DDR) $D^L=D^A(1+z)^2$. Observational validation of this relation is quite\nimportant because any evidence of its violation could be a signal of new\nphysics. In this paper we introduce a new method to test DDR based on strong\ngravitational lensing systems and type Ia supernovae under a flat universe. The\nmethod itself is worth attention, because unlike previously proposed\ntechniques, it does not depend on all other prior assumptions concerning the\ndetails of cosmological model. We tested it using a new compilation of strong\nlensing systems and JLA compilation of type Ia supernovae and found no evidence\nof DDR violation. For completeness, we also combined it with previous cluster\ndata and showed its power on constraining DDR. It could become a promising new\nprobe in the future in light of forthcoming massive strong lensing surveys and\nbecause of expected advances in galaxy cluster modlelling.\n", "  We investigate another supersymmetric Chern-Simons theory called the\norientifold ABJM theory, which replaces the unitary supergroup structure of the\nABJM theory with an orthosymplectic one. Its non-perturbative structure is\ncompletely clarified by considering the duplication of the quiver.\n", "  Anticipating realization of interacting fermions in an optical lattice with a\nlarge gauge field, we consider phase transitions and loop currents in a\ntwo-dimensional S=1/2 fermionic-Hubbard model with $\\pi$/2-staggered flux at\nhalf filling. We use a variational Monte Carlo method, which is reliable even\nfor strong correlations. As a trial wave function, a coexistent state of\nantifferomagnetic and staggered-flux orders is studied. In a strongly\ncorrelated regime, the ground state becomes an insulating coexistent state with\nloop currents. By comparing fermions with bosons, we discuss an important role\nof Pauli principle.\n", "  In this paper we present a detailed study of the antiferromagnetic classical\nHeisenberg model on a bilayer honeycomb lattice in a highly frustrated regime\nin presence of a magnetic field. This study shows strong evidence of entropic\norder-by-disorder selection in different sectors of the magnetization curve.\nFor antiferromagnetic couplings $J_1=J_x=J_p/3$, we find that at low\ntemperatures there are two different regions in the magnetization curve\nselected by this mechanism with different number of soft and zero modes. These\nregions present broken $Z_2$ symmetry and are separated by a not fully\ncollinear classical plateau at $M=1/2$. At higher temperatures, there is a\ncrossover from the conventional paramagnet to a cooperative magnet. Finally, we\nalso discuss the low temperature behavior of the system for a less frustrated\nregion, $J_1=J_x<J_p/3$.\n", "  We study the dipole response associated with the Pygmy Dipole Resonance (PDR)\nand the Isovector Giant Dipole Resonance (IVGDR), in connection with specific\nproperties of the nuclear effective interaction (symmetry energy and momentum\ndependence), in the neutron-rich systems $^{68}$Ni, $^{132}$Sn and $^{208}$Pb.\nWe perform our investigation within a microscopic transport model based on the\nLandau-Vlasov kinetic equation. We observe that the peak energies of PDR and\nIVGDR are shifted to higher values when employing momentum dependent\ninteractions, with respect to the results obtained neglecting momentum\ndependence. The calculated energies are close to the experimental values and\nsimilar to the results obtained in Hartree-Fock (HF) with Random Phase\nApproximation (RPA) calculations.\n", "  Following the membrane paradigm, we explore the effect of the gravitational\n$\\Theta$-term on the behavior of the stretched horizon of a black hole in\n(3+1)-dimensions. We reformulate the membrane paradigm from a quantum\npath-integral point of view where we interpret the macroscopic properties of\nthe horizon as effects of integrating out the region inside the horizon. The\ngravitational $\\Theta$-term is a total derivative, however, using our framework\nwe show that this term affects the transport properties of the horizon. In\nparticular, the horizon acquires a third order parity violating, dimensionless\ntransport coefficient which affects the way localized perturbations scramble on\nthe horizon. Then we consider a large-N gauge theory in (2+1)-dimensions which\nis dual to an asymptotically AdS background in (3+1)-dimensional spacetime to\nshow that the $\\Theta$-term induces a non-trivial contact term in the\nenergy-momentum tensor of the dual theory. As a consequence, the dual gauge\ntheory in the presence of the $\\Theta$-term acquires the same third order\nparity violating transport coefficient.\n", "  We investigate the development of novel surface states when 3D Dirac or Weyl\nsemimetals are placed under circularly polarized electromagnetic radiation. We\nfind that the hybridization between inverted Floquet bands opens in general a\ngap, which closes at so-called exceptional points found for complex values of\nthe momentum. This corresponds to the appearance of midgap surface states in\nthe form of evanescent waves decaying from the surface exposed to the\nradiation. We observe a phenomenon reminiscent of Landau quantization by which\nthe midgap surface states get a large degeneracy proportional to the radiation\nflux traversing the surface of the semimetal. We show that all these surface\nstates carry angular current, leading to an angular modulation of their charge\nthat rotates with the same frequency of the radiation, which should manifest in\nthe observation of a macroscopic chiral current in the irradiated surface.\n", "  We present temperature-dependent atomic and magnetic pair distribution\nfunction (PDF) analysis of neutron total scattering measurements of\nantiferromagnetic MnO, an archetypal strongly correlated transition-metal\noxide. The known antiferromagnetic ground-state structure fits the\nlow-temperature data closely with refined parameters that agree with\nconventional techniques, confirming the reliability of the newly developed\nmagnetic PDF method. The measurements performed in the paramagnetic phase\nreveal significant short-range magnetic correlations on a $\\sim$1~nm length\nscale that differ substantially from the low-temperature long-range spin\narrangement. \\textit{Ab initio} calculations using a self-interaction-corrected\nlocal spin density approximation of density functional theory predict magnetic\ninteractions dominated by Anderson superexchange and reproduce the measured\nshort-range magnetic correlations to a high degree of accuracy. Further\ncalculations simulating an additional contribution from a direct exchange\ninteraction show much worse agreement with the data. The Anderson superexchange\nmodel for MnO is thus verified by experiment and confirmed by \\textit{ab\ninitio} theory.\n", "  The significance of discovering the boson of 750 GeV is beyond finding a\nsingle heavy boson, because it may hint the location of the scale for new\nphysics beyond the standard model which is the target of long-time exploration.\nThere have been many models to explain the diphoton excess observed by the\nATLAS and CMS collaborations and the BLMSSM is one of them. The BLMSSM is an\nextension of the minimal supersymmetric model where baryon and lepton numbers\nare local gauge symmetries. We analyze the decay channels $\\Phi\\rightarrow gg$,\n$\\Phi\\rightarrow\\gamma\\gamma$, $\\Phi\\rightarrow Z\\gamma$, and $\\Phi\\rightarrow\n\\bar{t}t,\\;VV\\;(V=Z,\\;W)$ with the mass of the CP-odd scalar $\\Phi=A_{_B}^0$\nbeing around $750\\;{\\rm GeV}$ in this model. Within a certain parameter space,\nthe scenario can account for the experimental data on the diphoton excess.\n", "  In the thermal dark matter (DM) paradigm, primordial interactions between DM\nand Standard Model particles are responsible for the observed DM relic density.\nIn Boehm et al. (2014), we showed that weak-strength interactions between DM\nand radiation (photons or neutrinos) can erase small-scale density\nfluctuations, leading to a suppression of the matter power spectrum compared to\nthe collisionless cold DM (CDM) model. This results in fewer DM subhaloes\nwithin Milky Way-like DM haloes, implying a reduction in the abundance of\nsatellite galaxies. Here we use very high resolution N-body simulations to\nmeasure the dynamics of these subhaloes. We find that when interactions are\nincluded, the largest subhaloes are less concentrated than their counterparts\nin the collisionless CDM model and have rotation curves that match\nobservational data, providing a new solution to the \"too big to fail\" problem.\n", "  A spectral and the inverse spectral problem are studied for the two-component\nmodified Camassa-Holm type for measures associated to interlacing peaks. It is\nshown that the spectral problem is equivalent to an inhomogenous string problem\nwith Dirichlet/Neumann boundary conditions. The inverse problem is solved by\nStieltjes' continued fraction expansion, leading to an explicit construction of\npeakon solutions. Sufficient conditions for the global existence in $t$ are\ngiven. The large time asymptotics reveals that, asymptotically, peakons pair up\nto form bound states moving with constant speeds. The peakon flow is shown to\nproject to one of the isospectral flows of the finite Kac--van Moerbeke\nlattice.\n", "  We study on the tripartite entanglement dynamics when each party is initially\nentangled with other parties, but they locally interact with their own\nnon-Markovian environment. First, we consider three GHZ-type initial states,\nall of which have GHZ symmetry provided that the parameters are chosen\nappropriately. However, this symmetry is broken due to the effect of\nenvironment. The corresponding $\\pi$-tangles, one of the tripartite\nentanglement measure, are analytically computed at arbitrary time. The revival\nphenomenon of entanglement occurs after complete disappearance of entanglement.\nWe also consider two W-type initial states. The revival phenomenon also occurs\nin this case. On the analytical ground the robustness issue against the effect\nof environment is examined for both GHZ-type and W-type initial states.\n", "  Scalable photonic quantum technologies require on-demand single-photon\nsources with simultaneously high levels of purity, indistinguishability, and\nefficiency. These key features, however, have only been demonstrated separately\nin previous experiments. Here, by s-shell pulsed resonant excitation of a\nPurcell-enhanced quantum dot-micropillar system, we deterministically generate\nresonance fluorescence single photons which, at pi pulse excitation, have an\nextraction efficiency of 66%, single-photon purity of 99.1%, and photon\nindistinguishability of 98.5%. Such a single-photon source for the first time\ncombines the features of high efficiency and near-perfect levels of purity and\nindistinguishabilty, and thus open the way to multi-photon experiments with\nsemiconductor quantum dots.\n", "  In the framework of $f(T)$ gravity, we focus on a weak-field and spherically\nsymmetric solution for the Lagrangian $f(T)=T+\\alpha T^{2}$, where $\\alpha$ is\na small constant which parameterizes the departure from General Relativity. In\nparticular, we study the propagation of light and obtain the correction to the\ngeneral relativistic bending angle. Moreover, we discuss the impact of this\ncorrection on some gravitational lensing observables, and evaluate the\npossibility of constraining the theory parameter $\\alpha$ by means of\nobservations. In particular, on taking into account the astrometric accuracy in\nthe Solar System, we obtain that $|\\alpha| \\leq 1.85 \\times 10^{5}\\,\n\\mathrm{m^{2}}$; this bound is looser than those deriving from the analysis of\nSolar System dynamics, e.g. $|\\alpha| \\leq 5 \\times 10^{-1}\\, \\mathrm{m^{2}}$,\n$|\\alpha| \\leq 1.8 \\times 10^{4}\\, \\mathrm{m^{2}}$ or $|\\alpha| \\leq 1.2 \\times\n10^{2}\\, \\mathrm{m^{2}}$ . However we suggest that, since the effect only\ndepends on the impact parameter, better constraints could be obtained by\nstudying light bending from planetary objects.\n", "  Recent experimental evidence points to low-energy magnons as the primary\ncontributors to the spin Seebeck effect. This spectral dependence is puzzling\nsince it is not observed on other thermocurrents in the same material. Here, we\nargue that the physical origin of this behavior is the magnon-magnon scattering\nmediated by phonons, in a process which conserves the number of magnons. To\nassess the importance and features of this kind of scattering, we derive the\neffective magnon-phonon interaction from a microscopic model, including band\nenergy, a screened electron-electron interaction and the electron-phonon\ninteraction. Unlike higher order magnon-only scattering, we find that the\ncoupling with phonons induce a scattering which is very small for low-energy\n(or subthermal) magnons but increases sharply above a certain energy --\nrendering magnons above this energy poor spin-current transporters.\n", "  We clarify the conditions for the emergence of multiple-${\\bf Q}$ structures\nout of lattice and easy-axis spin anisotropy in frustrated magnets. By\nconsidering magnets whose exchange interaction has multiple global minima in\nmomentum space, we find that both types of anisotropy stabilize triple-${\\bf\nQ}$ orderings. Moderate anisotropy leads to a magnetic field-induced skyrmion\ncrystal, which evolves into a bubble crystal for increasing spatial or spin\nanisotropy. The bubble crystal exhibits a quasi-continuous (devil's staircase)\ntemperature dependent ordering wave-vector, characteristic of the competition\nbetween frustrated exchange and strong easy-axis anisotropy.\n", "  A method to construct integrable deformations of Hamiltonian systems of ODEs\nendowed with Lie-Poisson symmetries is proposed by considering Poisson-Lie\ngroups as deformations of Lie-Poisson (co)algebras. Moreover, the underlying\nLie-Poisson symmetry of the initial system of ODEs is used to construct\nintegrable coupled systems, whose integrable deformations can be obtained\nthrough the construction of the appropriate Poisson-Lie groups that deform the\ninitial symmetry. The approach is applied in order to construct integrable\ndeformations of both uncoupled and coupled versions of certain integrable types\nof R\\\"ossler and Lorenz systems. It is worth stressing that such deformations\nare of non-polynomial type since they are obtained through an exponentiation\nprocess that gives rise to the Poisson-Lie group from its infinitesimal Lie\nbialgebra structure. The full deformation procedure is essentially algorithmic\nand can be computerized to a large extent.\n", "  The promotion of collinear classical spin configurations as well as the\nenhanced tendency towards nearest-neighbor clustering of the quantum spins are\ntypical features of the frustrating isotropic three-body exchange interactions\nin Heisenberg spin systems. Based on numerical density-matrix renormalization\ngroup calculations, we demonstrate that these extra interactions in the\nHeisenberg chain constructed from alternating S=3/2 and sigma=1/2 site spins\ncan generate numerous specific quantum spin states, including some\npartially-polarized ferrimagnetic states as well as a doubly-degenerate\nnon-magnetic gapped phase. In the non-magnetic region of the phase diagram, the\nmodel describes a crossover between the spin-1 and spin-2 Haldane-type states.\n", "  We measure strong radio-frequency (RF) electric fields using rubidium Rydberg\natoms prepared in a room-temperature vapor cell as field sensors.\nElectromagnetically induced transparency is employed as an optical readout. We\nRF-modulate the 60$S_{1/2}$ and 58$D_{5/2}$ Rydberg states with 50~MHz and\n100~MHz fields, respectively. For weak to moderate RF fields, the Rydberg\nlevels become Stark-shifted, and sidebands appear at even multiples of the\ndriving frequency. In high fields, the adjacent hydrogenic manifold begins to\nintersect the shifted levels, providing rich spectroscopic structure suitable\nfor precision field measurements. A quantitative description of strong-field\nlevel modulation and mixing of $S$ and $D$ states with hydrogenic states is\nprovided by Floquet theory. Additionally, we estimate the shielding of DC\nelectric fields in the interior of the glass vapor cell.\n", "  Astronomical images from optical photometric surveys are typically\ncontaminated with transient artifacts such as cosmic rays, satellite trails and\nscattered light. We have developed and tested an algorithm that removes these\nartifacts using a deep, artifact free, static sky coadd image built up through\nthe median combination of point spread function (PSF) homogenized, overlapping\nsingle epoch images. Transient artifacts are detected and masked in each single\nepoch image through comparison with an artifact free, PSF-matched simulated\nimage that is constructed using the PSF-corrected, model fitting catalog from\nthe artifact free coadd image together with the position variable PSF model of\nthe single epoch image. This approach works well not only for cleaning single\nepoch images with worse seeing than the PSF homogenized coadd, but also the\ntraditionally much more challenging problem of cleaning single epoch images\nwith better seeing. In addition to masking transient artifacts, we have\ndeveloped an interpolation approach that uses the local PSF and performs well\nin removing artifacts whose widths are smaller than the PSF full width at half\nmaximum, including cosmic rays, the peaks of saturated stars and bleed trails.\nWe have tested this algorithm on Dark Energy Survey Science Verification data\nand present performance metrics. More generally, our algorithm can be applied\nto any survey which images the same part of the sky multiple times.\n", "  We present qHiPSTER, the Quantum High Performance Software Testing\nEnvironment. qHiPSTER is a distributed high-performance implementation of a\nquantum simulator on a classical computer, that can simulate general\nsingle-qubit gates and two-qubit controlled gates. We perform a number of\nsingle- and multi-node optimizations, including vectorization, multi-threading,\ncache blocking, as well as overlapping computation with communication. Using\nthe TACC Stampede supercomputer, we simulate quantum circuits (\"quantum\nsoftware\") of up to 40 qubits. We carry out a detailed performance analysis to\nshow that our simulator achieves both high performance and high hardware\nefficiency, limited only by the sustainable memory and network bandwidth of the\nmachine.\n", "  We report distinct nonanalytic signatures in the spin-orbit entanglement of a\n2D electron gas with Rashba interactions at integer values of the filling\nfactor and at certain level crossings. The accompanying sharp changes in the\nbulk spin-orbit entanglement entropy can be probed by measuring the fluctuation\nin the transverse spin polarization of the electron gas.\n", "  We study bond percolation of the Cayley tree (CT) by focusing on the\nprobability distribution function (PDF) of a local variable, namely, the size\nof the cluster including a selected vertex. Because the CT does not have a\ndominant bulk region, which is free from the boundary effect, even in the\nlarge-size limit, the phase of the system on it is not well defined. We herein\nshow that local observation is useful to define the phase of such a system in\nassociation with the well-defined phase of the system on the Bethe lattice,\nthat is, an infinite regular tree without boundary. Above the percolation\nthreshold, the PDFs of the vertex at the center of the CT (the origin) and of\nthe vertices near the boundary of the CT (the leaves) have different forms,\nwhich are also dissimilar to the PDF observed in the ordinary percolating phase\nof a Euclidean lattice. The PDF for the origin of the CT is bimodal: a decaying\nexponential function and a system-size-dependent asymmetric peak, which obeys a\nfinite-size-scaling law with a fractal exponent. These modes are respectively\nrelated to the PDFs of the finite and infinite clusters in the nonuniqueness\nphase of the Bethe lattice. On the other hand, the PDF for the leaf of the CT\nis a decaying power function. This is similar to the PDF observed at a critical\npoint of a Euclidean lattice but is attributed to the nesting structure of the\nCT around the boundary.\n", "  Tremendous progress has been realized in quantum optics for engineering and\ndetecting the quantum properties of light. Today, photon pairs are routinely\ncreated in entangled states. Entanglement is revealed using single-photon\ndetectors in which a single photon triggers an avalanche current. The resulting\nsignal is then processed and stored in a computer. Here, we propose an approach\nto get rid of all the electronic devices between the photons and the\nexperimentalist i.e. to use the experimentalist's eye to detect entanglement.\nWe show in particular, that the micro entanglement that is produced by sending\na single photon into a beam-splitter can be detected with the eye using the\nmagnifying glass of a displacement in phase space. The feasibility study\nconvincingly demonstrates the possibility to realize the first experiment where\nentanglement is observed with the eye.\n", "  We study the interacting bosons in topological Hofstadter bands with Chern\nnumber two. Using exact diagonalization, we demonstrate that bosonic integer\nquantum Hall (BIQH) state emerges at integer boson filling factor $\\nu=1$ of\nthe lowest Chern band with evidences including a robust spectrum gap and\nquantized topological Hall conductance two. Moreover, the robustness of BIQH\nstate against different interactions and next-nearest neighbor hopping is\ninvestigated. The strong nearest neighbor interaction would favor a charge\ndensity wave. When the onsite interaction decreases, BIQH state undergoes a\ncontinuous transition into a superfluid state. Without next-nearest neighbor\nhopping, the ground state is possibly in a metallic Fermi-liquid-like phase.\n", "  The 750 GeV diphoton excess reported by ATLAS and CMS indicates the presence\nof several pairs of the vector-like matter multiplets around TeV scale. If that\nis the case, radiative corrections from the $SU(3)$ gauge interaction\nsignificantly change from those of MSSM, and the infrared-free nature of the\ngauge interaction leads to characteristic SUSY mass spectra: a ratio of a\nsquark mass to the gluino mass, and scalar trilinear couplings are enhanced at\nthe low-energy scale. Consequently, even in gaugino mediation models, the Higgs\nboson mass of 125 GeV is explained with the fairly light gluino of 2-3 TeV,\nwhich can be accessible at the LHC.\n", "  The efficiency statistics of a small thermodynamic machine has been recently\ninvestigated assuming that the total dissipation was a linear combination of\ntwo currents: the input and output currents. Here, we relax this standard\nassumption and reconsider the question of the efficiency fluctuations for a\nmachine involving three different processes, first in full generality and\nsecond for two different examples. Since the third process may not be\nmeasurable and/or may decrease the machine efficiency, our motivation is to\nstudy the effect of unknown losses in small machines.\n", "  In the context of massless quantum electrodynamics (QED) with a linear\ncovariant gauge fixing, the connection between the counterterm and the\nHopf-algebraic approach to renormalization is examined. The coproduct formula\nof Green's functions contains two invariant charges, which give rise to\ndifferent renormalization group functions. All formulas are tested by explicit\ncomputations to third loop order. The possibility of a finite electron\nself-energy by fixing a generalized linear covariant gauge is discussed. An\nanalysis of subdivergences leads to the conclusion that such a gauge only\nexists in quenched QED.\n", "  Using superspace techniques, we compute the mixed OPE between an ${\\mathcal\nN}=2$ stress-tensor multiplet, a chiral multiplet and a flavor current\nmultiplet. We perform a detailed analysis of the three-point function between\ntwo of the mentioned multiplets and a third arbitrary operator. We then solve\nall the constraints coming from the ${\\mathcal N}=2$ superconformal symmetry\nand from the equations of motion and/or conservation equations, and obtain all\nthe possible operators that can appear in the expansion. This calculation is\nthe first step towards a more general superconformal block analysis of mixed\ncorrelators in ${\\mathcal N}=2$ theories.\n", "  Using a set of rephasing-invariant variables, it is shown that the\nrenormalization group equations for quark mixing parameters can be written in a\nform that is compact, in addition to having simple properties under flavor\npermutation. We also found approximate solutions to these equations if the\nquark masses are hierarchical or nearly degenerate.\n", "  A simultaneous fit of parton distribution functions (PDFs) and electroweak\nparameters to HERA data on deep inelastic scattering is presented. The input\ndata are the neutral current and charged current inclusive cross sections which\nwere previously used in the QCD analysis leading to the HERAPDF2.0 PDFs. In\naddition, the polarisation of the electron beam was taken into account for the\nZEUS data recorded between 2004 and 2007. Results on the vector and\naxial-vector couplings of the Z boson to u- and d-type quarks, on the value of\nthe electroweak mixing angle and the mass of the W boson are presented. The\nvalues obtained for the electroweak parameters are in agreement with Standard\nModel predictions.\n", "  We investigate non-BPS exact solutions in ${\\mathbb C}P^{N-1}$ sigma models\non ${\\mathbb R}^1 \\times S^{1}$ with twisted boundary conditions, by using the\nDin-Zakrzewski projection method. We focus on the relation of the non-BPS\nsolutions to the ansatz of multi-instanton (bion) configurations and discuss\ntheir significance in the context of the resurgence theory. We find that the\ntransition between seemingly distinct configurations of multi-instantons occur\nas moduli changes in the non-BPS solutions, and the simplest non-BPS exact\nsolution corresponds to multi-bion configurations with fully-compressed double\nfractional instantons in the middle. It indicates that the non-BPS solutions\nmake small but nonzero contribution to the resurgent trans-series as special\ncases of the multi-bion configurations. We observe a generic pattern of\ntransitions between distinct multi-bion configurations (flipping partners),\nleading to the three essential properties of the non-BPS exact solution: (i)\nopposite sign for terms corresponding to the left and right infinities, (ii)\nsymmetric location of fractional instantons, and (iii) the transition between\ndistinct bion configurations. By studying the balance of forces, we show that\nthe relative phases between the instanton constituents play decisive roles in\nstability and instability of the muli-instanton configurations. We discuss\nlocal and global instabilities of the solutions such as negative modes and the\nflow to the other saddle points, by considering the deformations of the non-BPS\nexact solutions within our multi-instanton ansatz. We also briefly discuss some\nclasses of the non-BPS exact solutions in Grassmann sigma models.\n", "  An abundance analysis is reported of 58 K giants identified by Famaey et al.\n(2005) as highly probable members of the Hercules stream selected from stars\nnorth of the celestial equator in the Hipparcos catalogue. The giants have\ncompositions spanning the interval [Fe/H] from $-$0.17 to $+$0.42 with a mean\nvalue of $+$0.15 and relative elemental abundances [El/Fe] representative of\nthe Galactic thin disc. Selection effects may have biassed the selection from\nthe Hipparcos catalogue against the selection of metal-poor stars. Our\nreconsideration of the recent extensive survey of FG dwarfs which included\nmetal-poor stars (Bensby et al. 2014) provides a [Fe/H] distribution for the\nHercules stream which is similar to that from the 58 giants. It appears that\nthe stream is dominated by metal-rich stars from the thin disc. Suggestions in\nthe literature that the stream includes metal-poor stars from the thick disc\nare discussed.\n", "  Many asteroids in the main and trans-Neptunian belts are trapped in mean\nmotion resonances with Jupiter and Neptune, respectively. As a side effect,\nthey experience accidental commensurabilities among themselves. These\ncommensurabilities define characteristic patterns that can be used to trace the\nsource of the observed resonant behaviour. Here, we explore systematically the\nexistence of commensurabilities between the known ETNOs using their\nheliocentric and barycentric semimajor axes, their uncertainties, and Monte\nCarlo techniques. We find that the commensurability patterns present in the\nknown ETNO population resemble those found in the main and trans-Neptunian\nbelts. Although based on small number statistics, such patterns can only be\nproperly explained if most, if not all, of the known ETNOs are subjected to the\nresonant gravitational perturbations of yet undetected trans-Plutonian planets.\nWe show explicitly that some of the statistically significant\ncommensurabilities are compatible with the Planet Nine hypothesis; in\nparticular, a number of objects may be trapped in the 5:3 and 3:1 mean motion\nresonances with a putative Planet Nine with semimajor axis of about 700 au.\n", "  Using an additivity property, we study particle-number fluctuations in a\nsystem of interacting self-propelled particles, called active Brownian\nparticles (ABPs), which consists of repulsive disks with random self-propulsion\nvelocities. From a fluctuation-response relation - a direct consequence of\nadditivity, we formulate a thermodynamic theory which captures the previously\nobserved features of nonequilibrium phase transition in the ABPs from a\nhomogeneous fluid phase to an inhomogeneous phase of coexisting gas and liquid.\nWe substantiate the predictions of additivity by analytically calculating the\nsubsystem particle-number distributions in the homogeneous fluid phase away\nfrom criticality where analytically obtained distributions are compatible with\nsimulations in the ABPs.\n", "  This is a research highlight invited by SCIENCE CHINA Physics, Mechanics &\nAstronomy.\n", "  We present yet another composite model explaining the relatively broad peak\nin the diphoton invariant mass distribution around 750 GeV recently observed at\nthe LHC experiments. We consider the excess originates in bound states of\nvector-like fermions Q transforming under the electroweak group (but not QCD)\nof the standard model and which are also charged under a new SU(N_{TC})\nQCD-like confining force. Since the new uncolored fields transform as SU(2)\ndoublets they can acquire a mass through Yukawa interactions with the\nelectroweak Higgs doublet, as quarks and leptons. We parametrize the Q-onium\nbound state using the Coulomb approximation and give a numerical fit to the\ndiphoton excess consistent with no strong coupling effects up to about 30 TeV,\nwhich is the energy scale for next generation colliders. The range of allowed\nhypercharge Y_Q is given by 2.26 \\leq Y_Q \\leq 2.53 for N_{\\rm TC} =2 and 2.17\n\\leq Y_Q \\leq 2.31 for N_{\\rm TC} = 3. The smoking gun for the model would be\nthe discovery of Q-onia decaying into Higgs and Z-boson.\n", "  We present a statistical study of all measurable photometric features of a\nlarge sample of dwarf novae during their outbursts and superoutbursts. We used\nall accessible photometric data for all our objects to make the study as\ncomplete and up-to-date as possible. Our aim was to check correlations between\nthese photometric features in order to constrain theoretical models which try\nto explain the nature of dwarf novae outbursts. We managed to confirm a few of\nthe known correlations, that is the Stolz and Schoembs Relation, the Bailey\nRelation for long outbursts above the period gap, the relations between the\ncycle and supercycle lengths, amplitudes of normal and superoutbursts,\namplitude and duration of superoutbursts, outburst duration and orbital period,\noutburst duration and mass ratio for short and normal outbursts, as well as the\nrelation between the rise and decline rates of superoutbursts. However, we\nquestion the existence of the Kukarkin-Parenago Relation but we found an\nanalogous relation for superoutbursts. We also failed to find one presumed\nrelation between outburst duration and mass ratio for superoutbursts. This\nstudy should help to direct theoretical work dedicated to dwarf novae.\n", "  The potential of compressed sensing for obtaining sparse time-frequency\nrepresentations for gravitational wave data analysis is illustrated by\ncomparison with existing methods, as regards i) shedding light on the fine\nstructure of noise transients (glitches) in preparation of their\nclassification, and ii) boosting the performance of waveform consistency tests\nin the detection of unmodeled transient gravitational wave signals using a\nnetwork of detectors affected by unmodeled noise transient\n", "  In a recent paper we quantized the interaction of gravity with a Yang-Mills\nand Higgs field and obtained as a result a gravitational wave equation in a\nglobally hyperbolic spacetime. Assuming that the Cauchy hypersurfaces are\ncompact we proved a spectral resolution for the wave equation by applying the\nmethod of separation of variables. In this paper we extend the results to the\ncase when the Cauchy hypersurfaces are non-compact by considering a Gelfand\ntriplet and applying the nuclear spectral theorem.\n", "  The Crab pulsar and its nebula are very luminous and variable. Since 1982,\nrandom fluctuations of the dispersion measure (DM) have been recorded. Also in\n2011, Fermi-LAT telescope detected $\\gamma$-ray flux variation of the Crab\nnebula. No correlation between these phenomena have considered although their\nfluctuating patterns look similar. We propose a model which connects the DM and\nthe Crab nebula $\\gamma$-ray flux fluctuation, motivated by recently reported\ncorrelation between the braking index and the DM variability. Considering\nelectrons within the inner shock region of the nebula produced in breaking\nindex change events, we can explain both the DM enhancement and the\n$\\gamma$-ray flare in a simple way.\n", "  In order to optimize the performance of gas-jet targets for future nuclear\nreaction measurements, a detailed understanding of the dependence of the\ngas-jet properties on experiment design parameters is required. Common methods\nof gas-jet characterization rely on measuring the effective thickness using\nnuclear elastic scattering and energy loss techniques; however, these tests are\ntime intensive and limit the range of design modifications which can be\nexplored to improve the properties of the jet as a nuclear reaction target.\nThus, a more rapid jet-characterization method is desired. We performed the\nfirst steps towards characterizing the gas-jet density distribution of the\nHIPPO gas-jet target at the University of Notre Dame's Nuclear Science\nLaboratory by reproducing results from\n$^{20}\\rm{Ne}(\\alpha,\\alpha)^{20}\\rm{Ne}$ elastic scattering measurements with\ncomputational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations performed with the\nstate-of-the-art CFD software ANSYS Fluent. We find a strong sensitivity to\nexperimental design parameters of the gas-jet target, such as the jet nozzle\ngeometry and ambient pressure of the target chamber. We argue that improved\npredictive power will require moving to three-dimensional simulations and\nadditional benchmarking with experimental data.\n", "  We present new version of previously published Fortran and C programs for\nsolving the Gross-Pitaevskii equation for a Bose-Einstein condensate with\ncontact interaction in one, two and three spatial dimensions in imaginary and\nreal time, yielding both stationary and non-stationary solutions. To reduce the\nexecution time on multicore processors, new versions of parallelized programs\nare developed using Open Multi-Processing (OpenMP) interface. The input in the\nprevious versions of programs was the mathematical quantity nonlinearity for\ndimensionless form of Gross-Pitaevskii equation, whereas in the present\nprograms the inputs are quantities of experimental interest, such as, number of\natoms, scattering length, oscillator length for the trap, etc. New output files\nfor some integrated one- and two-dimensional densities of experimental interest\nare given. We also present speedup test results for the new programs.\n", "  We investigate the superconductivity in the $t-J-U$ model within a slave-spin\nformalism. We show that the BCS mean-field theory implemented with the slave\nspin formalism naturally predicts two distinct gaps which are the pairing gap\nof the spinons $\\Delta_f$ and the Cooper pairing gap of the electrons\n$\\Delta_{SC} = Z\\Delta_f$, where $Z$ is the quasiparticle weight. Furthermore,\nwe find that the nature of the superconducting state depends crucially on the\ninteraction providing the pairing mechanism. For spin interactions, the\nbandwidth of the spinon hopping term is renormalized by $Z$ but the its pairing\nterm is not. As a result, if $U$ exceeds the critical value for the Mott\ninsulating state at half-filling, $Z$ develops a strong doping dependence,\nleading to a doping-driven crossover from strong to weak pairing states. In the\nstrong pairing state, while $\\Delta_f$ is enhanced as $x\\to 0$,\n$\\Delta_{SC}\\sim x$ due to the renormalization of $Z$. In the weak pairing\nstate, $Z$ does not change with $x$ significantly. Therefore, $\\Delta_{SC}$ is\nmainly controlled by $\\Delta_f$, and both of them go to zero at larger doping.\nThe crossover from strong to weak pairing states is well captured by the slave\nspin formalism within reasonable range of parameters just at the mean-field\nlevel, indicating the slave spin formalism is a powerful tool to study\ncorrelated materials. For charge interactions, we find that the bandwidth of\nthe spinon hopping term and its pairing term are renormalized by $Z$ and $Z^2$\nrespectively. Consequently, both $\\Delta_f$ and $\\Delta_{SC}$ are suppressed at\nsmall $x$ in large U, and no crossover will occur. The implication of our\nresults for the superconducting states in correlated materials will be\ndiscussed.\n", "  While galaxies at $6 \\lesssim z \\lesssim 10$ are believed to dominate the\nepoch of cosmic reionization, the escape fraction of ionizing flux\n$f_\\mathrm{esc}$ and the photon production rate $\\dot n_\\gamma$ from these\ngalaxies must vary with redshift to simultaneously match CMB and low-redshift\nobservations. We constrain $f_\\mathrm{esc}(z)$ and $\\dot n_\\gamma(z)$ with\nPlanck 2015 measurements of the Thomson optical depth $\\tau$, recent low\nmultipole E-mode polarization measurements from Planck 2016, SDSS BAO data, and\n$3 \\lesssim z \\lesssim 10$ galaxy observations. We compare different galaxy\nluminosity functions that are calibrated to HST observations, using both\nparametric and non-parametric statistical methods that marginalize over the\neffective clumping factor $C_\\mathrm{HII}$, the LyC production efficiency\n$\\xi_\\mathrm{ion}$, and the time-evolution of the UV limiting magnitude\n$dM_\\mathrm{SF}/dz$. Using a power-law model, we find $f_\\mathrm{esc} \\lesssim\n0.5$ at $z=8$ with slope $\\beta \\gtrsim 2.0$ at $68\\%$ confidence with little\ndependence on the galaxy luminosity function or data, although there is\nnon-negligible probability for no redshift evolution $\\beta \\sim 0$ or small\nescape fraction $f_\\mathrm{esc} \\sim 10^{-2}$. A non-parametric form for\n$f_\\mathrm{esc}(z)$ evolves significantly with redshift, yielding\n$f_\\mathrm{esc} \\sim 0.2, 0.3, 0.6$ at $z=6,9,12$, respectively. However, a\nmodel-independent reconstruction of $\\dot n_\\gamma(z)$ predicts a suppressed\nescaped photon production rate at $z=9$ for the latest Planck data compared to\nthe other models, implying a quicker period of reionization. We find evidence\nfor redshift evolution in the limiting magnitude of the galaxy luminosity\nfunction for empirical models of the galaxy luminosity function.\n", "  We report fabrication and results of high-resolution X-ray topography\ncharacterization of diamond single crystal plates with a large surface area\n(10$\\times$10 mm$^2$) and (111) crystal surface orientation for applications in\nhigh-heat-load X-ray crystal optics. The plates were fabricated by laser\ncutting of the (111) facets of diamond crystals grown using high-pressure\nhigh-temperature method. The intrinsic crystal quality of a selected\n3$\\times$7~mm$^2$ crystal region of one of the studied samples was found to be\nsuitable for applications in wavefront-preserving high-heat-load crystal\noptics. The wavefront characterization was performed using sequential X-ray\ndiffraction topography in the pseudo plane wave configuration and data analysis\nusing rocking curve topography. The variation of the rocking curve width and\npeak position measured with a spatial resolution of 13$\\times$13 $\\mu m^2$ over\nthe selected region were found to be less than one microradian.\n", "  Rabi oscillations describe the interaction of a two-level system with a\nrotating electromagnetic field. As such, they serve as the principle method for\nmanipulating quantum bits. By using a combination of femtosecond laser pulses\nand microwave excitations, we have observed the classical form of Rabi\nnutations in a ferromagnetic system whose equations of motion mirror the case\nof a precessing quantum two-level system. Key to our experiments is the\nselection of a subset of spins that is in resonance with the microwave\nexcitation and whose coherence time is thereby extended. Taking advantage of\nGilbert damping, the relaxation times are further increased such that\nmode-locking takes place. The observation of such Rabi nutations is the first\nstep towards potential applications based on phase-coherent spin manipulation\nin ferromagnets.\n", "  The observation of magnetic interaction at the interface between nonmagnetic\noxides has attracted much attention in recent years. In this report, we show\nthat the Kondo-like scattering at the SrTiO3-based conducting interface is\nenhanced by increasing the lattice mismatch and growth oxygen pressure PO2. For\nthe 26-unit-cell LaAlO3/SrTiO3 (LAO/STO) interface with lattice mismatch being\n3.0%, the Kondo-like scattering is observed when PO2 is beyond 1 mTorr. By\ncontrast, when the lattice mismatch is reduced to 1.0% at the\n(La0.3Sr0.7)(Al0.65Ta0.35)O3/SrTiO3 (LSAT/STO) interface, the metallic state is\nalways preserved up to PO2 of 100 mTorr. The data from Hall measurement and\nX-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy reveal that the\nlarger amount of localized Ti3+ ions are formed at the LAO/STO interface\ncompared to LSAT/STO. Those localized Ti3+ ions with unpaired electrons can be\nspin-polarized to scatter mobile electrons, responsible for the Kondo-like\nscattering observed at the LAO/STO interface.\n", "  The motility of many parasites is critical for the infection process of their\nhost, as exemplified by the transmission cycle of the blood fluke Schistosoma\nmansoni. In their human infectious stage, immature, submillimetre-scale forms\nof the parasite known as cercariae swim in freshwater and infect humans by\npenetrating through the skin. This infection causes Schistosomiasis, a\nparasitic disease that is comparable to malaria in its global socio-economic\nimpact. Given that cercariae do not feed and hence have a finite lifetime of\naround 12 hours, efficient motility is crucial for the parasite's survival and\ntransmission of Schistosomiasis. However, a first-principles understanding of\nhow cercariae swim is lacking. Via a combined experimental, theoretical and\nrobotics based approach, we demonstrate that cercariae propel themselves\nagainst gravity by exploiting a unique elastohydrodynamic coupling. We show\nthat cercariae beat their tail in a periodic fashion while maintaining a fixed\nflexibility near their posterior and anterior ends. The flexibility in these\nregions allows an interaction between the fluid drag and bending resistance: an\nelastohydrodynamic coupling, to naturally break time-reversal symmetry and\nenable locomotion at small length-scales. We present a theoretical model, a\n'T-swimmer', which captures the key swimming phenotype of cercariae. We further\nvalidate our results experimentally through a macro-scale robotic realization\nof the 'T-swimmer', explaining the unique forked-tail geometry of cercariae.\nFinally, we find that cercariae maintain the flexibility at their posterior and\nanterior ends at an optimal regime for efficient swimming, as predicted by our\ntheoretical model. We anticipate that our work sets the ground for linking the\nswimming of S. mansoni cercariae to disease transmission and enables\nexplorations of novel strategies for Schistosomiasis prevention.\n", "  Magneto-transport measurements have been carried out on Bi2-xSbxSe3 (x = 0,\n0.05, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5) single crystals at 4.2 K temperature in the magnetic field\nrange of -15 T to 15 T. Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillations of 2D nature were\nobserved in samples with Sb concentration upto x = 0.3. The analyses of SdH\noscillations observed in magneto-resistance data using Lifshitz-Kosevich\nequation reveal a systematic decrease in the Fermi surface area with Sb\nsubstitution. The Berry phase obtained from the Landau Level fan diagram\nsuggests the occurrence of 2D oscillations arising from a Topological Surface\nState (TSS) for Sb concentrations of x = 0, 0.05 and 0.1; while 2D oscillation\nseen at higher Sb concentration is attributed to surface 2D electron gas\nconsequent to downward band bending.\n", "  A hierarchy of normalized classes of generalized Burgers equations is\nstudied. The equivalence groupoids of these classes are computed. The\nequivalence groupoids of classes of linearizable generalized Burgers equations\nare related to those of the associated linear counterparts using the Hopf--Cole\ntransformation.\n", "  We recently constructed the $R$-Poincar\\'e algebra from an appropriate\ndeformed Poisson brackets which reproduce the Fock coordinate transformation.\nWe showed then that the spacetime of this transformation is the de Sitter one.\nIn this paper, we derive in the $R$-Minkowski spacetime the Dirac equation and\nshow that this is none other than the Dirac equation in the de Sitter spacetime\ngiven by its conformally flat metric. Furthermore, we propose a new approach\nfor solving Dirac's equation in the de Sitter spacetime using the\nSchr\\\"{o}dinger picture.\n", "  Numerous studies have proved the usefulness of surface patterning for the\nmodification of tribological performances of sliding contacts. Here we\ninvestigate the effects of patterning on the tribological properties of a\nslider over a solid substrate. We show that, depending on the numerical density\nof surface grooves, the tribological properties can change significantly. A low\ndensity of surface patterning leads to a decrease of static friction force,\nwhile a higher density weakens this effect. The decrease is related to a\nnon-uniform distribution of surface stress induced by patterning. We believe\nthese findings and approach to be relevant for technological applications and\nrelated optimal design.\n", "  We find the equivalence groupoid of a~class of $(1+1)$-dimensional\nsecond-order evolution equations, which are called generalized potential\nBurgers equations. This class is related via potentialization with two classes\nof variable-coefficient generalized Burgers equations. Its equivalence groupoid\nis of complicated structure and is described via partitioning the entire class\ninto three normalized subclasses such that there are no point transformations\nbetween equations from different subclasses. For each of these subclasses we\nconstruct its equivalence group of an appropriate kind.\n", "  Integrable quantum field models are known to exist mostly in one\nspace-dimension. Exploiting the concept of multi-time in integrable systems and\na Lax matrix of higher scaling order, we construct a novel quantum field model\nin quasi-two dimensions involving interacting fields. The Yang-Baxter\nintegrability is proved for the model by finding a new kind of commutation rule\nfor its basic fields, representing nonstandard scalar fields along the\ntransverse direction. In spite of a close link with the quantum Landau-Lifshitz\nequation, the present model differs widely from it, in its content and the\nresult obtained. Using further the algebraic Bethe ansatz we solve exactly the\neigenvalue problem of this quantum field model for all its higher conserved\noperators. The idea presented here should instigate the construction of a novel\nclass of integrable field and lattice models and exploration of a new type of\nunderlying algebras.\n", "  The competition among different phases in perovskite manganites is pronounced\nsince their energies are very close under the interplay of charge, spin,\norbital and lattice degrees of freedom. To reveal the roles of underlying\ninteractions, many efforts have been devoted towards directly imaging phase\ntransitions at microscopic scales. Here we show images of the charge-ordered\ninsulator (COI) phase transition from a pure ferromagnetic metal with reducing\nfield or increasing temperature in a strained phase-separated manganite film,\nusing a home-built magnetic force microscope. Compared with the COI melting\ntransition, this reverse transition is sharp, cooperative and martensitic-like\nwith astonishingly unique yet diverse morphologies. The COI domains show\nvariable-dimensional growth at different temperatures and their distribution\ncan illustrate the delicate balance of the underlying interactions in\nmanganites. Our findings also display how phase domain engineering is possible\nand how the phase competition can be tuned in a controllable manner.\n", "  Bottom-up approaches allow the production of ultra-narrow and atomically\nprecise graphene nanoribbons (GNRs), with electronic and optical properties\ncontrolled by the specific atomic structure. Combining Raman spectroscopy and\nab-initio simulations, we show that GNR width, edge geometry and functional\ngroups all influence their Raman spectra. The low-energy spectral region below\n1000 cm-1 is particularly sensitive to edge morphology and functionalization,\nwhile the D peak dispersion can be used to uniquely fingerprint the presence of\nGNRs, and differentiates them from other sp2 carbon nanostructures.\n", "  We have used realistic local interactions based on the recent update of the\nstrangeness $-2$ Nijmegen ESC08c potential to calculate the bound state problem\nof the $\\Xi NN$ system in the $(I)J^P=(\\frac{1}{2})\\frac{3}{2}^+$ state. We\nfound that this system presents a deeply bound state lying $13.5$ MeV below the\n$\\Xi d$ threshold. Since in lowest order, pure S$-$wave configuration, this\nsystem can not decay into the open $\\Lambda\\Lambda N$ channel, its decay width\nis expected to be very small. We have also recalculated the\n$(I)J^P=(\\frac{3}{2})\\frac{1}{2}^+$ state and we have compared with results of\nquark-model based potentials.\n", "  Magnetic fields are often used for characterizing transport in nanoscale\nmaterials. Recent magnetotransport experiments have demonstrated that ballistic\ntransport is possible in graphene antidot lattices (GALs). These experiments\nhave inspired the present theoretical study of GALs in a perpendicular magnetic\nfield. We calculate magnetotransport through graphene antidot barriers (GABs),\nwhich are finite rows of antidots arranged periodically in a pristine graphene\nsheet, using a tight-binding model and the Landauer-B\\\"uttiker formula. We show\nthat GABs behave as ideal Dirac mass barriers for antidots smaller than the\nmagnetic length, and demonstrate the presence of magnetic edge states, which\nare localized states on the periphery of the antidots due to successive\nreflections on the antidot edge in the presence of a magnetic field. We show\nthat these states are robust against variations in lattice configuration and\nantidot edge chirality. Moreover, we calculate the transmittance of disordered\nGABs and find that magnetic edge states survive a moderate degree of disorder.\nDue to the long phase-coherence length in graphene and the robustness of these\nstates, we expect magnetic edge states to be observable in experiments as well.\n", "  We report an experimental demonstration of a local amplification of the spin\nHall voltage using an expanding depletion zone at a pn-junction in GaAs/AlGaAs\nHall-bar microdevices. It is demonstrated that the depletion zone can be\nspatially expanded by applying reverse bias by at least 10~$\\mu$m at low\ntemperature. In the depleted regime, the spin Hall signals reached more than\none order of magnitude higher values than in the normal regime at the same\nelectrical current flowing through the micro-device. It is shown that the\npn-bias has two distinct effects on the detected spin Hall signal. It controls\nthe local drift field at the Hall cross which is highly non-linear in the\npn-bias due to the shift of the depletion front. Simultaneously, it produces a\nchange in the spin-transport parameters due to the non-linear change in the\ncarrier density at the Hall cross with the pn-bias.\n", "  We give a new proof of Witten asymptotic conjecture for Seifert manifolds\nwith non vanishing Euler class and one exceptional fiber. Our method is based\non semiclassical analysis on a two dimensional phase space torus. We prove that\nthe Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev invariant of a Seifert manifold is the scalar\nproduct of two Lagrangian states, and we estimate this scalar product in the\nlarge level limit. The leading order terms of the expansion are naturally given\nin terms of character varieties, the Chern-Simons invariants and some\nsymplectic volumes. For the analytic part, we establish some singular\nstationary phase lemma for discrete oscillatory sums.\n", "  The study of transverse-momentum spectra of quarks and gluons produced by the\ncolor electric flux tube decaying through the Schwinger tunneling mechanism is\nreviewed. The hints for a fast hydrodynamization in the ultra-relativistic\nheavy-ion collisions are found.\n", "  We consider the dynamics of a single shock in a partially asymmetric simple\nexclusion process (PASEP) on a finite lattice with open boundaries in the\nsublattice-parallel updating scheme. We then construct the steady state of the\nsystem by considering a linear superposition of these shocks. It is shown that\nthis steady state can also be written in terms of a product of four non-\ncommuting matrices. One of the main results obtained here is that these\nmatrices have exactly the same generic structure as the matrices first\nintroduced in Jafarpour and Masharian (2009 Phys. Rev. E 79 051124) indicating\nthat the steady state of a one-dimensional driven-diffusive system can be\nwritten as a linear superposition of product shock measures. It is now easy to\nexplain the two-dimensional matrix representation of the PASEP with parallel\ndynamics introduced in Essler and Rittenberg (1996 J. Phys. A: Math. Gen. 29\n3375) and Honecker and Peschel (1997 J. Stat. Phys. 88 319).\n", "  Based on the exact dynamics of a two-qubit system and environment, we\ninvestigate system-environment (SE) quantum and classical correlations. The\ncoupling is chosen to represent a dephasing channel for one of the qubits and\nthe environment is a proper thermal bath. First we discuss the general issue of\ndilation for qubit phase damping. Based on the usual thermal bath of harmonic\noscillators, we derive criteria of separability and entanglement between an\ninitial $X$ state and the environment. Applying these criteria to initial\nWerner states, we find that entanglement between the system and environment is\nbuilt up in time for temperatures below a certain critical temperature\n$T_{\\mathrm{crit}}$. On the other hand, the total state remains separable\nduring those short times that are relevant for decoherence and loss of\nentanglement in the two-qubit state. Close to $T_{\\mathrm{crit}}$ the SE\ncorrelations oscillate between separable and entangled. Even though these\noscillations are also observed in the entanglement between the two qubits, no\nsimple relation between the loss of entanglement in the two-qubit system and\nthe build-up of entanglement between the system and environment is found.\n", "  Results of a 2012 PRL Letter have recently been questioned by T. Kalaydzhyan\nin arXiv:1604.04486. Here we confirm our original results and conclusions by\naddressing all concerns raised in the Comment.\n", "  This brief contribution is devoted to phenomenological consequences of\ndeviations from Lorentz invariance in gravity and dark matter. We will discuss\nmain effects on cosmological observables and current constraints derived from\nastrophysical and cosmological data.\n", "  The concepts of spoof surface plasmon polaritons and adiabatic field\ncompression are employed to design metallic near-field probes that allow\nguiding and focusing of mid-infrared wavelength electromagnetic radiation and\nprovides subwavelength field confinements and a lateral optical resolution of\nabout 10 nm.\n", "  We explicitly prove that a class of finite quantum gravitational theories (in\nodd as well as in even dimension) is actually a range of anomaly-free\nconformally invariant theories in the spontaneously broken phase of the\nconformal Weyl symmetry. At classical level we show how the Weyl conformal\ninvariance is likely able to tame the spacetime singularities that plague not\nonly Einstein gravity, but also local and weakly non-local higher derivative\ntheories. This latter statement is rigorously proved by a singularity theorem\nthat applies to a large class of weakly non-local theories. Following the\nseminal paper by Narlikar and Kembhavi, we provide an explicit construction of\nsingularity-free black hole exact solutions conformally equivalent to the\nSchwarzschild metric. Furthermore, we show that the FRW cosmological solutions\nand the Belinski, Khalatnikov, Lifshitz (BKL) spacetimes, which exactly solve\nthe classical equations of motion, are conformally equivalent to regular\nspacetimes. Finally, we prove that the Oppenheimer-Volkov gravitational\ncollapse is a an exact (singularity-free) solution of the non-local conformally\ninvariant theory compatible with the bounce paradigm.\n", "  The more information a measurement provides about a quantum system's position\nstatistics, the less information a subsequent measurement can provide about the\nsystem's momentum statistics. This information trade-off is embodied in the\nentropic formulation of the uncertainty principle. Traditionally, uncertainty\nrelations correspond to resolution limits; increasing a detector's position\nsensitivity decreases its momentum sensitivity and vice-versa. However, this is\nnot required in general; for example, position information can instead be\nextracted at the cost of noise in momentum. Using random, partial projections\nin position followed by strong measurements in momentum, we efficiently\ndetermine the transverse-position and transverse-momentum distributions of an\nunknown optical field with a single set of measurements. The momentum\ndistribution is directly imaged, while the position distribution is recovered\nusing compressive sensing. At no point do we violate uncertainty relations;\nrather, we economize the use of information we obtain.\n", "  The second class of high-temperature superconductors (HTSCs), iron-based\npnictides and chalcogenides, necessarily contain Fe$_2$$X_2$ (\"$X$\" refers to a\npnictogen or a chalcogen element) layers, just like the first class of HTSCs\nwhich possess the essential CuO$_2$ sheets. So far, dozens of iron-based HTSCs,\nclassified into nine groups, have been discovered. In this article, the\ncrystal-chemistry aspects of the known iron-based superconductors are reviewed\nand summarized by employing \"hard and soft acids and bases (HSAB)\" concept.\nBased on these understandings, we propose an alternative route to exploring new\niron-based superconductors via rational structural design.\n", "  The existence of quantum time crystals is investigated and shown to be\npossible in pure phases defined by a state invariant under a group of space\ntranslations, as displayed by explicit examples.\n", "  The motion of classical spinning test particles in the equatorial plane of a\nKerr black hole is considered for the case where the particle spin is\nperpendicular to the equatorial plane. We review some results of our recent\nresearch of the innermost stable circular orbits (ISCO) [P.I. Jefremov, O.Yu.\nTsupko and G.S. Bisnovatyi-Kogan, Phys.Rev. D 91 124030 (2015)] and present\nsome new calculations. The ISCO radius, total angular momentum, energy, and\norbital angular frequency are considered. We calculate the ISCO parameters\nnumerically for different values of the Kerr parameter $a$ and investigate\ntheir dependence on both black hole and test particle spins. Then we describe\nin details how to calculate analytically small-spin corrections to the ISCO\nparameters for an arbitrary values of $a$. The cases of Schwarzschild, slowly\nrotating Kerr and extreme Kerr black hole are considered. The use of the\norbital angular momentum is discussed. We also consider the ISCO binding\nenergy. It is shown that the efficiency of accretion onto an extreme Kerr black\nhole can be larger than the maximum known efficiency (42 %) if the test body\nhas a spin.\n", "  English Translation of Paul Drude's 1902 investigation into the factors\naffecting the self-resonance of single-layer solenoid coils. The ratio of the\nself-resonant half-wavelength to the conductor length is is found to be\nprincipally dependent on the height-to diameter ratio of the coil and the\ndielectric constants of any insulating materials involved in the construction.\n", "  We consider skew products $$T_\\phi:X\\times G\\to X\\times\nG,~~(x,g)\\mapsto(F_1(x),g\\;\\!\\phi(x)),$$ where $X$ is a compact manifold with\nprobability measure, $G$ a compact Lie group with Lie algebra $\\frak g$,\n$F_1:X\\to X$ the time-one map of a measure-preserving flow, and $\\phi\\in\nC^1(X,G)$ a cocycle. Then, we define the degree of $\\phi$ as a suitable\nfunction $P_\\phi M_\\phi:X\\to\\frak g$, we show that it transforms in a natural\nway under Lie group homomorphisms and under the relation of $C^1$-cohomology,\nand we explain how it generalises previous definitions of degree of a cocycle.\nFor each finite-dimensional irreducible representation $\\pi$ of $G$, and $\\frak\ng_\\pi$ the Lie algebra of $\\pi(G)$, we define in an analogous way the degree of\n$\\pi\\circ\\phi$ as a suitable function\n$P_{\\pi\\circ\\phi}M_{\\pi\\circ\\phi}:X\\to\\frak g_\\pi$. If $F_1$ is uniquely\nergodic and the functions $\\pi\\circ\\phi$ diagonal, or if $T_\\phi$ is uniquely\nergodic, then the degree of $\\phi$ reduces to a constant in $\\frak g$ given by\nan integral over $X$. As a by-product, we obtain that there is no uniquely\nergodic skew product $T_\\phi$ with nonzero degree if $G$ is a connected\nsemisimple compact Lie group.\n  Next, we show that $T_\\phi$ is mixing in the orthocomplement of the kernel of\n$P_{\\pi\\circ\\phi}M_{\\pi\\circ\\phi}$, and under some additional assumptions we\nshow that $U_\\phi$ has purely absolutely continuous spectrum in that\northocomplement if $(iP_{\\pi\\circ\\phi}M_{\\pi\\circ\\phi})^2$ is strictly\npositive. Summing up these results for each $\\pi$, one obtains a global result\nfor the mixing and the absolutely continuous spectrum of $T_\\phi$. As an\napplication, we present four explicit cases: when $G$ is a torus, $G=SU(2)$,\n$G=SO(3,\\mathbb R)$, and $G=U(2)$. In each case, the results we obtain are new,\nor generalise previous results.\n  Our proofs rely on new results on positive commutator methods for unitary\noperators.\n", "  We demonstrate electrical spin injection into multilayer graphene (MLG) in a\nlateral spin valve device from a highly spin-polarized Co2FeSi (CFS) Huesler\nelectrode. Exfoliated MLG was transferred onto pre-patterned epitaxial CFS\nwires grown on an Si(111) substrate by a polymer-based transfer method. This\nmethod enabled us to fabricate multiple single-crystal CFS electrodes in\ncontact with MLG. Electrical spin injection from CFS to MLG was detected\nthrough non-local magnetoresistance (MR) measurement. A non-local spin signal\nof 430 ohm was observed; this is the largest value among all reported non-local\nMR values in graphene-based devices.\n", "  Solutions to the Maxwell-Bloch equations for a $\\Lambda$ system are computed\nusing the single-soliton Darboux transformation and the nonlinear superposition\nprinciple. These allow complete control of information deposited by a signal\npulse (with the help of an auxiliary control pulse) in the coherence of the\nmedium's ground states by injecting sub-sequential pulses. Additionally, we\nstudy the encoding of two signal pulses and their manipulation by a control\npulse and show that multipulse storage and control are possible as long as the\nimprints made by encoding the signal pulses are sufficiently separated.\n", "  In this paper we deal with the care one must have in adopting approximations\nin regard with terms he chooses to leave behind in the particular case of the\nexpression valid for the maximum period of a long pendulum oscillating near\nEarth's surface.\n", "  Gaussian beams are often used in optical systems. The fundamental Gaussian\nTEM00 mode is the most common of the Gaussian modes present in various optical\ndevices, systems and equipment. Within an optical system, it is common that\nthis Gaussian TEM00 beam passes through a circular aperture of a finite\ndiameter. Such circular apertures include irises, spatial filters, circular\nPhoto-Detectors (PDs) and optical mounts with circular rims. The magnitude of\noptical power passing through a finite-sized circular aperture is\nwell-documented for cases where the Gaussian beam passes through the center of\nthe clear circular aperture, and is chopped off symmetrically in all radial\ndirections on a given plane. More often than not, a non-axial incident Gaussian\nBeam is not blocked in a radially uniform manner by a circular aperture. Such\nsituations arise due to a lateral displacement of the beam from tilted glass\nblocks, manufacturing errors and imperfect surface flatness or parallelness of\nsurfaces. The fraction of optical power of a laterally-shifted Gaussian Beam\npassing through a circular aperture is calculated in this paper through\nconventional integration techniques.\n", "  A basic theoretical framework is developed in which elementary particles have\na component of their wave function extending into higher spatial dimensions.\nThis model postulates an extension of the Schrodinger equation to include a 4th\nand 5th spatial component. A higher-dimensional simple harmonic oscillator\nconfining potential localizes particles into 3-d space, characterizing the\nbrane tension which confines Standard Model particles to the sub-manifold.\nQuantum effects allow a non-zero probability for a particle's evanescent\nexistence in the higher dimensions, and suggest an experimental test for the\nvalidity of this model via particles being temporarily excited into the first\nexcited state of the extra-dimensional potential well, in which their\nprobability of existing in 3-d space transiently drops to zero. Several\nconsistency checks of the outcomes of this extra-dimensional model are included\nin this paper. Among the outcomes of this model are: a match with the quantum\nphenomenon of zitterbewegung; the predicted intrinsic spin angular momentum is\nof order h/2Pi; the magnetic moment of the electron is determined with a\ngyromagnetic ratio of 2; the nuclear force hard core radius is accurately\npredicted; the ratio of the up and down quark masses is found to be mu/md=0.56,\nconsistent with QCD theory; a self-consistent derivation of special\nrelativistic effects is given; possible explanations of the Planck mass and\nPlanck length, and a possible explanation of the origin of electric charge. In\naddition, a simple application of higher-dimensional particle effects to the\nastrophysics of stars is briefly examined, showing that radical physical\ninconsistencies are not evident. Finally, this model suggests a possible\nexplanation of dark matter as the fractional probability manifestations of a\nladder of the higher-dimensional symmetric excited states of ordinary\nparticles.\n", "  Microstructure-property relationships of resistance spot welded 6061-T6\naluminum alloy lap joints were investigated via mechanical testing and\nmicroscopy techniques. Quasi-static tensile and novel shear punch tests were\nemployed to measure the mechanical properties of the distinct weld regions.\nQuasi-static tensile and shear punch tests revealed constantly decreasing\nstrength and ductility as the weld center was approached. For instance, the\nultimate tensile strength of the fusion zone decreased by ~52% from the parent\nmaterial (341 MPa to 162 MPa) while the yield strength decreased by ~62% (312\nMPa to 120 MPa). The process-induced microstructures were analyzed with\nscanning electron microscopy and optical microscopy to elucidate the underlying\ncause of the reduced mechanical properties. Fractography reveals void growth\nfrom particles being the dominant damage mechanism in the parent material as\ncompared to void nucleation in the fusion zone. Overall, significant changes in\nthe mechanical behavior across the weld are the result of a change in\nmicrostructure congruent with a loss of T6 condition (precipitate coarsening).\n", "  Quark models taking into account the dynamical effects of hadronic decay\noften produce very different predictions for mass shifts in the hadron\nspectrum. The consequences for meson spectroscopy can be dramatic and\ncompletely obscure the underlying confining force. Recent unquenched lattice\ncalculations of mesonic resonances that also include meson-meson interpolators\nprovide a touchstone for such models, despite the present limitations in\napplicability. On the experimental side, the $\\rho(770)$ meson and its several\nobserved radial recurrences are a fertile testing ground for both quark models\nand lattice computations. Here we apply a unitarised quark model that has been\nsuccessful in the description of many enigmatic mesons to these vector $\\rho$\nresonances and the corresponding $P$-wave $\\pi\\pi$ phase shifts. This work is\nin progress, with encouraging preliminary results.\n", "  Magnetization and heat capacity measurements of ternary rare earth\nintermetallic compound GdNiAl3 demonstrate para to ferromagnetic transition at\nTc=165.5K. In addition multiple short range magnetic transitions observed below\nTc are suggestive of competing interactions in this compound. As a result of\nthis a weak Griffiths phase type behaviour is observed in the paramagnetic\nregion. This complex behaviour is rather supported by the random orientation of\nNi centered tricapped trigonal prisms with additional Al atoms in the\nstructure. Heat capacity and resistivity data display an interesting peak at 72\nK, which is highly unaffected by magnetic fields up to 90KOe.\n", "  In this paper universality limits are studied in connection with measures\nwhich exhibit power-type singular behavior somewhere in their support. We\nextend the results of Lubinsky for Jacobi measures supported on $ [-1,1] $ to\ngeneralized Jacobi measures supported on a compact subset of the real line,\nwhere the singularity can be located in the interior or at an endpoint of the\nsupport. The analysis is based upon the Riemann-Hilbert method, Christoffel\nfunctions, the polynomial inverse image method of Totik and the normal family\napproach of Lubinsky.\n", "  We find the form of the potential depending on the coordinates and the time\nsuch that a solution, $S$, of the Hamilton--Jacobi equation yields an exact\nsolution, $\\exp ({\\rm i} S/\\hbar)$, of the corresponding Schr\\\"odinger\nequation.\n", "  I present a new scheme for tagging boosted heavy flavor jets called \"$\\mu_x$\ntagging\" and its application to TeV-scale physics beyond the Standard Model.\nUsing muons from B hadron decay to define a particular combination \"x\" of\nangular information, and jet substructure variables, we identify a clean\n($\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{fake}}/\\epsilon_b\\sim 1/100$) good efficiency ($\\epsilon_b\n= 14\\%$) tag. I demonstrate the usefulness of this new scheme by showing the\nreach for discovery of leptophobic $Z^\\prime\\to b\\bar b$ and $tH^\\pm\\to t t b$.\n", "  Nova explosions occur on the white dwarf component of a Cataclysmic Variable\nbinary stellar system that is accreting matter lost by its companion. When\nsufficient material has been accreted by the white dwarf, a thermonuclear\nrunaway occurs and ejects material in what is observed as a Classical Nova\nexplosion. We describe both the recent advances in our understanding of the\nprogress of the outburst and outline some of the puzzles that are still\noutstanding. We report on the effects of improving both the nuclear reaction\nrate library and including a modern nuclear reaction network in our\none-dimensional, fully implicit, hydrodynamic computer code. In addition, there\nhas been progress in observational studies of Supernovae Ia with implications\nabout the progenitors and we discuss that in this review.\n", "  The transverse momentum distribution of massive neutral vector bosons can be\nmeasured to high accuracy at hadron colliders. The transverse momentum is\ncaused by a partonic recoil, and is determined by QCD dynamics. We compute the\nsingle and double-differential transverse momentum distributions for fully\ninclusive $Z/\\gamma^*$ production including leptonic decay to\nnext-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in perturbative QCD. We also compute the\nsame distributions normalised to the cross sections for inclusive $Z/\\gamma^*$\nproduction, i.e. integrated over the transverse momentum of the lepton pair. We\ncompare our predictions for the fiducial cross sections to the 8 TeV data set\nfrom the ATLAS and CMS collaborations, which both observed a tension between\ndata and NLO theory predictions, using the experimental cuts and binning. We\nfind that the inclusion of the NNLO QCD effects does not fully resolve the\ntension with the data for the unnormalised $p^Z_T$ distribution. However, we\nobserve that normalising the NNLO $Z$-boson transverse momentum distribution by\nthe NNLO Drell-Yan cross section substantially improves the agreement between\nexperimental data and theory, and opens the way for precision QCD studies of\nthis observable.\n"]}
