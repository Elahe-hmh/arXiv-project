A term of effective\ngravitational range is introduced and classic Newton potential is substituted\nfor Yukawa-type potential. It allows to allocate a typical frequency value to\neach gravitational field. Derived theoretical conclusions led us to investigate\nthe effect of electromagnetic field with a precisely predetermined frequency\nand intensity on iron. We believe that under certain circumstances a decrease\nin iron gravitational mass should be observed. Two model experiments verifying\nthe theoretical conclusions are proposed.\n", "  We study the functor of points and the local functor of points (here called\nthe Weil--Berezin functor) for smooth and holomorphic supermanifolds, providing\ncharacterization theorems and fully discussing the representability issues. In\nthe end we examine applications to differential calculus including the\ntransitivity theorems.\n", "  We consider the semiclassical Einstein equations (SEE) in the presence of a\nquantum scalar field with self-interaction $\\lambda\\phi^4$. Working in the\nHartree truncation of the two-particle irreducible (2PI) effective action, we\ncompute the vacuum expectation value of the energy-momentum tensor of the\nscalar field, which act as a source of the SEE. We obtain the renormalized SEE\nby implementing a consistent renormalization procedure. We apply our results to\nfind self-consistent de Sitter solutions to the SEE in situations with or\nwithout spontaneous breaking of the $Z_2$-symmetry.\n", "  Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) observations resolve the structure and\ndynamics of metallic glass Cu$_{100-x}$Hf$_{x}$ films and demonstrate STM\ncontrol of aging at a metallic glass surface. Surface clusters exhibit\nheterogeneous hopping dynamics. Low Hf concentration films feature an aged\nsurface of larger, slower clusters. Argon ion-sputtering destroys the aged\nconfiguration, yielding a surface in constant fluctuation. STM can locally\nrestore the relaxed state, allowing for nanoscale lithographic definition of\naged sections.\n", "  We study dephasing of a superconducting qubit due to quasiparticle tunneling\nthrough a Josephson junction. While qubit decay due to tunneling processes is\nwell understood within a golden rule approximation, pure dephasing due to BCS\nquasiparticles gives rise to a divergent golden rule rate. We calculate qubit\ndephasing due to quasiparticle tunneling beyond lowest order approximation in\ncoupling between qubit and quasiparticles. Summing up a certain class of\ndiagrams we show that qubit dephasing due to purely longitudinal coupling to\nquasiparticles leads to a dephasing $\\sim \\exp(-x(t))$ where $x(t)$ is not\nlinear in time on short time scales while it tends towards a selfconsistent\ncalculated dephasing rate for longer times.\n", "  Noise-immune cavity-enhanced optical frequency comb spectroscopy (NICE-OFCS)\nis a recently developed technique that utilizes phase modulation to obtain\nimmunity to frequency-to-amplitude noise conversion by the cavity modes and\nyields high absorption sensitivity over a broad spectral range. We describe the\nprinciples of the technique and discuss possible comb-cavity matching\nsolutions. We present a theoretical description of NICE-OFCS signals detected\nwith a Fourier transform spectrometer (FTS), and validate the model by\ncomparing it to experimental CO2 spectra around 1575 nm. Our system is based on\nan Er:fiber femtosecond laser locked to a cavity and phase-modulated at a\nfrequency equal to a multiple of the cavity free spectral range (FSR). The\nNICE-OFCS signal is detected by a fast-scanning FTS equipped with a\nhigh-bandwidth commercial detector. We demonstrate a simple method of passive\nlocking of the modulation frequency to the cavity FSR that significantly\nimproves the long term stability of the system, allowing averaging times on the\norder of minutes. Using a cavity with a finesse of ~9000 we obtain absorption\nsensitivity of 6.4 x 10^{-11} cm^{-1} Hz^{-1/2} per spectral element, and\nconcentration detection limit for CO2 of 450 ppb Hz^{-1/2}, determined by\nmultiline fitting.\n", "  Two major problems call for an extension of the Standard Model (SM): the\nhierarchy problem in the Higgs sector and the dark matter in the Universe. The\ndiscovery of a Higgs boson with mass of about 125 GeV was clearly the most\nsignificant piece of news from CERN's Large Hadron Collider (LHC). In addition\nto representing the ultimate triumph of the SM, it shed new light on the\nhierarchy problem and opened up new ways of probing new physics. The various\nmeasurements performed at Run I of the LHC constrain the Higgs couplings to SM\nparticles as well as invisible and undetected decays. In this thesis, the\nimpact of the LHC Higgs results on various new physics scenarios is assessed,\ncarefully taking into account uncertainties and correlations between them.\nGeneric modifications of the Higgs coupling strengths, possibly arising from\nextended Higgs sectors or higher-dimensional operators, are considered.\nFurthermore, specific new physics models are tested. This includes, in\nparticular, the phenomenological Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model. While a\nHiggs boson has been found, no sign of beyond the SM physics was observed at\nRun I of the LHC in spite of the large number of searches performed by the\nATLAS and CMS collaborations. The implications of the negative results obtained\nin these searches constitute another important part of this thesis. First,\nsupersymmetric models with a dark matter candidate are investigated in light of\nthe negative searches for supersymmetry at the LHC using a so-called\n\"simplified model\" approach. Second, tools using simulated events to constrain\nany new physics scenario from the LHC results are presented. Moreover, during\nthis thesis the selection criteria of several beyond the SM analyses have been\nreimplemented in the MadAnalysis 5 framework and made available in a public\ndatabase.\n", "  Starting from the guiding principles of spacetime locality and\noperationalism, a general framework for a probabilistic description of nature\nis proposed. Crucially, no notion of time or metric is assumed, neither any\nspecific physical model. Remarkably, the emerging framework converges with a\nrecently proposed formulation of quantum theory, obtained constructively from\nknown quantum physics. At the same time the framework also admits statistical\ntheories of classical physics.\n", "  In the LHCb detector at CERN, decays of $\\chi_b(3P)$ meson to\n$\\Upsilon(1S)\\gamma$ and $\\Upsilon(2S)\\gamma$ are reported at centre-of-mass\nenergy of $\\sqrt s=7$ and 8 TeV. Following the success of the assignment of\n$\\chi_b(1P)\\to\\Upsilon(1S)\\gamma$ of the mass of $m(\\chi_b(1P))=9.8923$ GeV and\n$\\chi_b(2P)\\to\\Upsilon(1S)\\gamma$ of the mass of $m(\\chi_b(2P))=10.2547$ GeV,\nthe new state $\\chi_b(3P)$ of the mass of 10.5157 GeV was assigned, but its\n$J^{P}$ was not fixed.\n  We study the possibility that this boson is the light Higgs boson $h^0(0^+)$,\nand study its decay modes to a $b\\bar b$ which reduces to an $\\Upsilon(mS)$\n($m=1,2$ or 3) and $\\bar q q$ which reduces to a $\\gamma$, using the Cartan's\nsupersymmetry. Recent non observation of polarizations of $\\Upsilon(nS)$ by the\nCMS collaboration is consistent with the theory.\n", "  In many crystals with sufficient anharmonicity, a special kind of lattice\nvibrations, namely, discrete breathers (DBs) can be excited either thermally or\nby external triggering, in which the amplitude of atomic oscillations greatly\nexceeds that of harmonic oscillations (phonons). Coherency and persistence of\nlarge atomic oscillations in DBs may have drastic effect on quantum tunneling\ndue to correlation effects discovered by Schrodinger and Robertson in 1930.\nThese effects have been applied recently to the tunneling problem by Vysotskii\net al, who demonstrated a giant increase of sub-barrier transparency during the\nincrease of correlation coefficient at special high-frequency periodic action\non quantum system. In the present paper, it is argued that DBs present the most\nnatural and efficient way to produce correlation effects due to time-periodic\nmodulation of the potential well width and hence to act as breather\nnano-colliders (BNC) triggering low energy nuclear reactions (LENR) in solids.\nTunneling probability for deuterium (D-D) fusion in gap DBs formed in metal\ndeuterides is shown to increase drastically with increasing number of\noscillations resulting in the observed LENR rate at extremely low\nconcentrations of DBs. Possible ways of engineering the nuclear active\nenvironment based on the present concept are discussed.\n", "  In a mesoscopic system, under zero bias voltage, a finite charge is\ntransferred by quantum adiabatic pumping by adiabatically and periodically\nchanging two or more control parameters. We obtained expressions for the pumped\ncharge for a ring of three quantum dots (QDs) by choosing the magnetic flux\npenetrating the ring as one of the control parameters. We found that the pumped\ncharge shows a steplike behavior with respect to the variance of the flux. The\nvalue of the step heights is not universal but depends on the trajectory of the\ncontrol parameters. We discuss the physical origin of this behavior on the\nbasis of the Fano resonant condition of the ring.\n", "  We compare the decay of a Higgs boson $H^0(0^+)\\to\\ell\\bar\\ell\n\\ell\\bar\\ell\\to\\gamma\\gamma$, $H^0(0^+)\\to W\\bar W\\to \\ell\\bar\\nu\\bar\\ell\\nu$,\nand $H^0(0^+)\\to Z\\bar Z\\to\\ell\\bar\\ell\\ell\\bar\\ell$ using Cartan's\nsupersymmetry, that defines coupling of a vector particle $x_i$ and Dirac\nspinors $\\psi$ and $\\phi$.\n  Apparent discrepancy of $H^0(0^+)\\to\\gamma\\gamma/\\ell\\bar\\ell \\ell\\bar\\ell$\nexperimental data of ATLAS and CMS collaborations disappears, since the sum of\ntransition to $\\ell\\bar\\ell \\ell\\bar\\ell$ and $\\gamma\\gamma$ have the meaning.\nThe trilinearity of leptons vector fields coupling and the initial wave\nfunctions to be large components define Higgs-leptons couplings.\n  The ratio of Higgs boson decay branching ratios $H\\to WW=21.6\\pm 0.9$,\n$H\\to\\gamma\\gamma=0.228\\pm 0.011$ can be reproduced when we multiply coupling\nconstant $\\alpha_s\\simeq 1$ for $WW$ and $\\alpha_e=1/137$ for $\\gamma\\gamma$ to\nthe number of independent diagrams.\n  Comparison with Atiyah-Witten's quark-gluon dynamics on a manifold of $G_2$\nholonomy theory is added.\n", "  In a previous paper we proved that after a simple transformation the\ngenerating series of the linear Hodge integrals on the moduli space of stable\ncurves satisfies the hierarchy of the Intermediate Long Wave equation. In this\npaper we present a much shorter proof of this fact. Our new proof is based on\nan explicit formula for the one-point linear Hodge integrals that was found\nindependently by Faber, Pandharipande and Ekedahl, Lando, Shapiro, Vainshtein.\n", "  We have studied the existence of self-dual solitonic solutions in a\ngeneralization of the Abelian Chern-Simons-Higgs model. Such a generalization\nintroduces two different nonnegative functions, $\\omega_1(|\\phi|)$ and\n$\\omega(|\\phi|)$, which split the kinetic term of the Higgs field -\n$|D_\\mu\\phi|^2 \\rightarrow\\omega_1 (|\\phi|)|D_0\\phi|^2-\\omega(|\\phi|)\n|D_k\\phi|^2$ - breaking explicitly the Lorentz covariance. We have shown that a\nclean implementation of the Bogomolnyi procedure only can be implemented\nwhether $\\omega(|\\phi|) \\propto \\beta |\\phi|^{2\\beta-2}$ with $\\beta\\geq 1$.\nThe self-dual or Bogomolnyi equations produce an infinity number of soliton\nsolutions by choosing conveniently the generalizing function $\\omega_1(|\\phi|)$\nwhich must be able to provide a finite magnetic field. Also, we have shown that\nby properly choosing the generalizing functions it is possible to reproduce the\nBogomolnyi equations of the Abelian Maxwell-Higgs and Chern-Simons-Higgs\nmodels. Finally, some new self-dual $|\\phi|^6$-vortex solutions have been\nanalyzed both from theoretical and numerical point of view.\n", "  Numerous centrality measures have been developed to quantify the importances\nof nodes in time-independent networks, and many of them can be expressed as the\nleading eigenvector of some matrix. With the increasing availability of network\ndata that changes in time, it is important to extend such eigenvector-based\ncentrality measures to time-dependent networks. In this paper, we introduce a\nprincipled generalization of network centrality measures that is valid for any\neigenvector-based centrality. We consider a temporal network with N nodes as a\nsequence of T layers that describe the network during different time windows,\nand we couple centrality matrices for the layers into a supra-centrality matrix\nof size NTxNT whose dominant eigenvector gives the centrality of each node i at\neach time t. We refer to this eigenvector and its components as a joint\ncentrality, as it reflects the importances of both the node i and the time\nlayer t. We also introduce the concepts of marginal and conditional\ncentralities, which facilitate the study of centrality trajectories over time.\nWe find that the strength of coupling between layers is important for\ndetermining multiscale properties of centrality, such as localization phenomena\nand the time scale of centrality changes. In the strong-coupling regime, we\nderive expressions for time-averaged centralities, which are given by the\nzeroth-order terms of a singular perturbation expansion. We also study\nfirst-order terms to obtain first-order-mover scores, which concisely describe\nthe magnitude of nodes' centrality changes over time. As examples, we apply our\nmethod to three empirical temporal networks: the United States Ph.D. exchange\nin mathematics, costarring relationships among top-billed actors during the\nGolden Age of Hollywood, and citations of decisions from the United States\nSupreme Court.\n", "  Existing experimental implementations of continuous-variable quantum key\ndistribution require shot-noise limited operation, achieved with shot-noise\nlimited lasers. However, loosening this requirement on the laser source would\nallow for cheaper, potentially integrated systems. Here, we implement a\ntheoretically proposed prepare-and-measure continuous-variable protocol and\nexperimentally demonstrate the robustness of it against preparation noise\nstemming for instance from technical laser noise. Provided that direct\nreconciliation techniques are used in the post-processing we show that for\nsmall distances large amounts of preparation noise can be tolerated in contrast\nto reverse reconciliation where the key rate quickly drops to zero. Our\nexperiment thereby demonstrates that quantum key distribution with\nnon-shot-noise limited laser diodes might be feasible.\n", "  Orbital degree of freedom plays a fundamental role in understanding the\nunconventional properties in solid state materials. Experimental progress in\nquantum atomic gases has demonstrated that high orbitals in optical lattices\ncan be used to construct quantum emulators of exotic models beyond natural\ncrystals, where novel many-body states such as complex Bose-Einstein\ncondensation and topological semimetals emerge. A brief introduction of orbital\ndegree of freedom in optical lattices is given and a summary of exotic orbital\nmodels and resulting many-body phases is provided. Experimental consequences of\nthe novel phases are also discussed.\n", "  In this paper we use the notion of Grothendieck topology to present a unified\nway to approach representability in supergeometry, which applies to both the\ndifferential and algebraic settings.\n", "  Similarly-charged polyelectrolytes are known to attract each other and\naggregate into bundles when the charge density of the polymers exceeds a\ncritical value that depends on the valency of the counterions. The dynamics of\naggregation of such rigid polyelectrolytes are studied using large scale\nmolecular dynamics simulations. We find that the morphology of the aggregates\ndepends on the value of the charge density of the polymers. For values close to\nthe critical value, the shape of the aggregates is cylindrical with height\nequal to the length of a single polyelectrolyte chain. However, for larger\nvalues of charge, the linear extent of the aggregates increases as more and\nmore polymers aggregate.In both the cases, we show that the number of\naggregates decrease with time as power laws with exponents that are not\nnumerically distinguishable from each other, and are independent of charge\ndensity of the polymers, valency of the counterions, density, and length of the\npolyelectrolyte chain. We model the aggregation dynamics using the Smoluchowski\ncoagulation equation with kernels determined from the molecular dynamics\nsimulations, and justify the numerically obtained value of the exponent. Our\nresults suggest that, once counterions condense, effective interactions between\npolyelectrolyte chains short-ranged and the aggregation of polyelectrolytes is\ndiffusion-limited.\n", "  The familiar concepts of state vectors and operators in quantum mechanics\nrely on associative products of observables. However, these notions do not\napply to some exotic systems such as magnetic monopoles, which have long been\nknown to lead to non-associative algebras. Their quantum physics has remained\nobscure. This letter presents the first derivation of potentially testable\nphysical results in non-associative quantum mechanics, based on effective\npotentials. They imply new effects which cannot be mimicked in usual quantum\nmechanics with standard magnetic fields.\n", "  Neutrino physics is nowadays receiving more and more attention as a possible\nsource of information for the long--standing investigation of new physics\nbeyond the Standard Model. The rather recent measurement of the third mixing\nangle $\\theta_{13}$ in the standard mixing oscillation scenario encourages the\npursuit of what is still missing: the size of any leptonic CP violation,\nabsolute neutrino masses and the characteristic nature of the neutrino. Several\nprojects are currently running and they are providing impressive results. In\nthis review, the phenomenology of neutrino oscillations that results from the\nlast two decades of investigations is reviewed, with emphasis on our current\nknowledge and on what lesson can be taken from the past. We then present a\ncritical discussion of current studies on the mass ordering and what might be\nexpected from future results. Our conclusion is that decisions determining the\nnext generation of experiments and investigations have to be strictly based on\nthe findings of the current generation of experiment. In this sense it would be\nwise to wait a few years before taking decisions on the future projects. In the\nmeantime, since no direct path forward is evident for the future projects, the\ncommunity must be committed to their careful evaluation.\n", "  Elements heavier than zinc are synthesized through the (r)apid and (s)low\nneutron-capture processes. The main site of production of the r-process\nelements (such as europium) has been debated for nearly 60 years. Initial\nstudies of chemical abundance trends in old Milky Way halo stars suggested\ncontinual r-process production, in sites like core-collapse supernovae. But\nevidence from the local Universe favors r-process production mainly during rare\nevents, such as neutron star mergers. The appearance of a europium abundance\nplateau in some dwarf spheroidal galaxies has been suggested as evidence for\nrare r-process enrichment in the early Universe, but only under the assumption\nof no gas accretion into the dwarf galaxies. Cosmologically motivated gas\naccretion favors continual r-process enrichment in these systems. Furthermore,\nthe universal r-process pattern has not been cleanly identified in dwarf\nspheroidals. The smaller, chemically simpler, and more ancient ultra-faint\ndwarf galaxies assembled shortly after the first stars formed, and are ideal\nsystems with which to study nucleosynthesis events such as the r-process.\nReticulum II is one such galaxy. The abundances of non-neutron-capture elements\nin this galaxy (and others like it) are similar to those of other old stars.\nHere, we report that seven of nine stars in Reticulum II observed with\nhigh-resolution spectroscopy show strong enhancements in heavy neutron-capture\nelements, with abundances that follow the universal r-process pattern above\nbarium. The enhancement in this \"r-process galaxy\" is 2-3 orders of magnitude\nhigher than that detected in any other ultra-faint dwarf galaxy. This implies\nthat a single rare event produced the r-process material in Reticulum II. The\nr-process yield and event rate are incompatible with ordinary core-collapse\nsupernovae, but consistent with other possible sites, such as neutron star\nmergers.\n", "  Memory function formalism or projection operator technique is an extremely\nuseful method to study the transport and optical properties of various\ncondensed matter systems. A recent revival of its uses in various correlated\nelectronic systems is being observed. It is being used and discussed in various\ncontexts, ranging from non-equilibrium dynamics to the optical properties of\nvarious strongly correlated systems such as high temperature superconductors.\nHowever, a detailed discussion on this method, starting from its origin to its\npresent day applications at one place is lacking. In this article we attempt a\ncomprehensive review of the memory function approach focusing on its uses in\nstudying the dynamics and the transport properties of correlated electronic\nsystems.\n", "  We study driven finite quantum systems in contact with a thermal reservoir in\nthe regime in which the system changes slowly in comparison to the\nequilibration time. The associated isothermal adiabatic theorem allows us to\ncontrol the full statistics of energy transfers in quasi-static processes.\nWithin this approach, we extend Landauer's Principle on the energetic cost of\nerasure processes to the level of the full statistics and elucidate the nature\nof the fluctuations breaking Landauer's bound.\n", "  Deep rest-frame optical spectroscopy is critical for characterizing and\nunderstanding the physical conditions and properties of the ionized gas in\ngalaxies. Here, we present a new spectroscopic survey called \"Metal Abundances\nacross Cosmic Time\" or $\\mathcal{MACT}$, which will obtain rest-frame optical\nspectra for $\\sim$3000 emission-line galaxies. This paper describes the optical\nspectroscopy that has been conducted with MMT/Hectospec and Keck/DEIMOS for\n$\\approx$1900 $z=0.1-1$ emission-line galaxies selected from our narrowband and\nintermediate-band imaging in the Subaru Deep Field. In addition, we present a\nsample of 164 galaxies for which we have measured the weak [OIII]$\\lambda$4363\nline (66 with at least 3$\\sigma$ detections and 98 with significant upper\nlimits). This nebular emission line determines the gas-phase metallicity by\nmeasuring the electron temperature of the ionized gas. This paper presents the\noptical spectra, emission-line measurements, interstellar properties (e.g.,\nmetallicity, gas density), and stellar properties (e.g., star formation rates,\nstellar mass). Paper II of the $\\mathcal{MACT}$ survey (Ly et al.) presents the\nfirst results on the stellar mass--gas metallicity relation at $z\\lesssim1$\nusing the sample with [OIII]$\\lambda$4363 measurements.\n", "  We present the first results from MMT and Keck spectroscopy for a large\nsample of $0.1\\leq z\\leq1$ emission-line galaxies selected from our narrow-band\nimaging in the Subaru Deep Field. We measured the weak [OIII]$\\lambda$4363\nemission line for 164 galaxies (66 with at least 3$\\sigma$ detections, and 98\nwith significant upper limits). The strength of this line is set by the\nelectron temperature for the ionized gas. Because the gas temperature is\nregulated by the metal content, the gas-phase oxygen abundance is inversely\ncorrelated with [OIII]$\\lambda$4363 line strength. Our temperature-based\nmetallicity study is the first to span $\\approx$8 Gyr of cosmic time and\n$\\approx$3 dex in stellar mass for low-mass galaxies, $\\log{\\left(M_{\\rm\nstar}/M_{\\rm sun}\\right)}\\approx6.0-9.0$. Using extensive multi-wavelength\nphotometry, we measure the evolution of the stellar mass--gas metallicity\nrelation and its dependence on dust-corrected star formation rate (SFR). The\nlatter is obtained from high signal-to-noise Balmer emission-line measurements.\nOur mass-metallicity relation is consistent with Andrews & Martini at\n$z\\leq0.3$, and evolves toward lower abundances at a given stellar mass,\n$\\log{({\\rm O/H})}\\propto(1+z)^{-2.32^{+0.52}_{-0.26}}$. We find that galaxies\nwith lower metallicities have higher SFRs at a given stellar mass and redshift,\nalthough the scatter is large ($\\approx$0.3 dex), and the trend is weaker than\nseen in local studies. We also compare our mass--metallicity relation against\npredictions from high-resolution galaxy formation simulations, and find good\nagreement with models that adopt energy- and momentum-driven stellar feedback.\nWe have identified 16 extremely metal-poor galaxies with abundances less than a\ntenth of solar; our most metal-poor galaxy at $z\\approx0.84$ is similar to I Zw\n18.\n", "  We introduce quantum sensing schemes for measuring very weak forces with a\nsingle trapped ion. They use the spin-motional coupling induced by the\nlaser-ion interaction to transfer the relevant force information to the\nspin-degree of freedom. Therefore, the force estimation is carried out simply\nby observing the Ramsey-type oscillations of the ion spin states. Three quantum\nprobes are considered, which are represented by systems obeying the\nJaynes-Cummings, quantum Rabi (in 1D) and Jahn-Teller (in 2D) models. By using\ndynamical decoupling schemes in the Jaynes-Cummings and Jahn-Teller models, our\nforce sensing protocols can be made robust to the spin dephasing caused by the\nthermal and magnetic field fluctuations. In the quantum-Rabi probe, the\nresidual spin-phonon coupling vanishes, which makes this sensing protocol\nnaturally robust to thermally-induced spin dephasing. We show that the proposed\ntechniques can be used to sense the axial and transverse components of the\nforce with a sensitivity beyond the yN $/\\sqrt{\\text{Hz}}$ range, i.e. in the\nxN$ /\\sqrt{\\text{Hz}}$ (xennonewton, $10^{-27}$). The Jahn-Teller protocol, in\nparticular, can be used to implement a two-channel vector spectrum analyzer for\nmeasuring ultra-low voltages.\n", "  One-dimensional spinor gases with strong delta interaction fermionize and\nform a spin chain. The spatial degrees of freedom of this atom chain can be\ndescribed by a mapping to spinless noninteracting fermions and the spin degrees\nof freedom are described by a spin-chain model with nearest-neighbor\ninteractions. Here, we compute momentum and occupation-number distributions of\nup to 16 strongly interacting spinor fermions and bosons as a function of their\nspin imbalance, the strength of an externally applied magnetic field gradient,\nthe length of their spin, and for different excited states of the multiplet. We\nshow that the ground-state momentum distributions resemble those of the\ncorresponding noninteracting systems, apart from flat background distributions,\nwhich extend to high momenta. Moreover, we show that the spin order of the spin\nchain---in particular antiferromagnetic spin order---may be deduced from the\nmomentum and occupation-number distributions of the system. Finally, we present\nefficient numerical methods for the calculation of the single-particle\ndensities and one-body density matrix elements and of the local exchange\ncoefficients of the spin chain for large systems containing more than 20\nstrongly interacting particles in arbitrary confining potentials.\n", "  Full quantum state tomography (FQST) plays a unique role in the estimation of\nthe state of a quantum system without \\emph{a priori} knowledge or assumptions.\nUnfortunately, since FQST requires informationally (over)complete measurements,\nboth the number of measurement bases and the computational complexity of data\nprocessing suffer an exponential growth with the size of the quantum system. A\n14-qubit entangled state has already been experimentally prepared in an ion\ntrap, and the data processing capability for FQST of a 14-qubit state seems to\nbe far away from practical applications. In this paper, the computational\ncapability of FQST is pushed forward to reconstruct a 14-qubit state with a run\ntime of only 3.35 hours using the linear regression estimation (LRE) algorithm,\neven when informationally overcomplete Pauli measurements are employed. The\ncomputational complexity of the LRE algorithm is first reduced from\n$O(10^{19})$ to $O(10^{15})$ for a 14-qubit state, by dropping all the zero\nelements, and its computational efficiency is further sped up by fully\nexploiting the parallelism of the LRE algorithm with parallel Graphic\nProcessing Unit (GPU) programming. Our result can play an important role in\nquantum information technologies with large quantum systems.\n", "  We propose a novel approach for solving the scattering of light onto a\ntwo-level atom coupled to a one-dimensional waveguide. We first express the\nphysical quantity of interest in terms of Feynman diagrams and treat the atom\nas a non-saturable linear beamsplitter. By using the atomic response to our\nadvantage, a relevant substitution is then made that captures the nonlinearity\nof the atom, and the final result is obtained in terms of simple integrals over\nthe initial incoming wavepackets. The procedure is not limited to\npost-scattering quantities and allows for instance to derive the atomic\nexcitation during the scattering event.\n", "  A magnetic skyrmionium is a nontopological soliton, which has a doughnut-like\nout-of-plane spin texture in thin films, and can be phenomenologically viewed\nas a coalition of two topological magnetic skyrmions with opposite topological\nnumbers. Due to its zero topological number ($Q=0$) and doughnut-like\nstructure, the skyrmionium has its distinctive characteristics as compared to\nthe skyrmion with $Q=\\pm 1$. Here we systematically study the generation,\nmanipulation and motion of a skyrmionium in ultrathin magnetic nanostructures\nby applying a magnetic field or a spin-polarized current. It is found that the\nskyrmionium moves faster than the skyrmion when they are driven by the\nout-of-plane current, and their velocity difference is proportional to the\ndriving force. However, the skyrmionium and skyrmion exhibit an identical\ncurrent-velocity relation when they are driven by the in-plane current. It is\nalso found that a moving skyrmionium is less deformed in the current-in-plane\ngeometry compared with the skyrmionum in the current-perpendicular-to-plane\ngeometry. Furthermore we demonstrate the transformation of a skyrmionium with\n$Q=0$ into two skyrmions with $Q=+1$ in a nanotrack driven by a spin-polarized\ncurrent, which can be seen as the unzipping process of a skyrmionium. We\nillustrate the energy and spin structure variations during the skyrmionium\nunzipping process, where linear relations between the spin structure and\nenergies are found. These results could have technological implications in the\nemerging field of skyrmionics.\n", "  Boundary integral methods are advantageous when simulating viscous flow\naround rigid particles, due to the reduction in number of unknowns and\nstraightforward handling of the geometry. In this work we present a fast and\naccurate framework for simulating spheroids in periodic Stokes flow, which is\nbased on the completed double layer boundary integral formulation. The\nframework implements a new method known as quadrature by expansion (QBX), which\nuses surrogate local expansions of the layer potential to evaluate it to very\nhigh accuracy both on and off the particle surfaces. This quadrature method is\naccelerated through a newly developed precomputation scheme. The long range\ninteractions are computed using the spectral Ewald (SE) fast summation method,\nwhich after integration with QBX allows the resulting system to be solved in M\nlog M time, where M is the number of particles. This framework is suitable for\nsimulations of large particle systems, and can be used for studying e.g. porous\nmedia models.\n", "  We study the fluctuations of the anisotropy of the energy density profile\ncreated in a high-energy collision at the LHC. We show that the anisotropy in\nharmonic $n$ has generic non-Gaussian fluctuations. We argue that these\nnon-Gaussianities have a universal character for small systems such as p+Pb\ncollisions, but not for large systems such as Pb+Pb collisions where they\ndepend on the underlying non-Gaussian statistics of the initial density\nprofile. We generalize expressions for the eccentricity cumulants\n$\\varepsilon_2\\{4\\}$ and $\\varepsilon_3\\{4\\}$ previously obtained within the\nindependent-source model to a general fluctuating initial density profile.\n", "  The Shannon based conditional entropy that underlies five-dimensional\nEinstein-Hilbert gravity coupled to a dilaton field is investigated in the\ncontext of dynamical holographic AdS/QCD models. Considering the UV and IR\ndominance limits of such AdS/QCD models, the conditional entropy is shown to\nshed some light onto the meson classification schemes, which corroborate with\nthe existence of light-flavour mesons of lower spins in Nature. Our analysis is\nsupported by a correspondence between statistical mechanics and information\nentropy which establishes the physical grounds to the Shannon information\nentropy, also in the context of statistical mechanics, and provides some\nspecificities for accurately extending the entropic discussion to continuous\nmodes of physical systems. From entropic informational grounds, the conditional\nentropy allows one to identify the lower experimental/phenomenological\noccurrence of higher spin mesons in Nature. Moreover, it introduces a\nquantitative theoretical apparatus for studying the instability of high spin\nlight-flavour mesons.\n", "  We theoretically investigate quantum interference of two single photons at a\nlossy asymmetric beam splitter, the most general passive 2$\\times$2 optical\ncircuit. The losses in the circuit result in a non-unitary scattering matrix\nwith a non-trivial set of constraints on the elements of the scattering matrix.\nOur analysis using the noise operator formalism shows that the loss allows\ntunability of quantum interference to an extent not possible with a lossless\nbeam splitter. Our theoretical studies support the experimental demonstrations\nof programmable quantum interference in highly multimodal systems such as\nopaque scattering media and multimode fibers.\n", "  We find that the purifications of several Gaussian maximally mixed states\n(GMMSs) correspond to some Gaussian maximally entangled states (GMESs) in the\ncontinuous-variable regime. Here, we consider a two-mode squeezed vacuum (TMSV)\nstate as a purification of the thermal state and construct a general formalism\nof the Gaussian purification process. Moreover, we introduce other kind of\nGMESs via the process. All of our purified states of the GMMSs exhibit Gaussian\nprofiles; thus, the states show maximal quantum entanglement in the Gaussian\nregime.\n", "  We investigate the possibility of gauge coupling unification in various\nradiative neutrino mass models, which generate neutrino masses at one- and/or\ntwo-loop level. Renormalization group running of gauge couplings is performed\nanalytically and numerically at one- and two-loop order, respectively. We study\nthree different classes of neutrino mass models: (I) minimal ultraviolet\ncompletions of the dimension-7 $\\Delta L=2$ operators which generate neutrino\nmasses at one- and/or two-loop level without and with dark matter candidates,\n(II) models with dark matter which lead to neutrino masses at one-loop level\nand (III) models with particles in the adjoint representation of\n$\\mathrm{SU}(3)$. In class (I), gauge couplings unify in a few models and\nadding dark matter amplifies the chances for unification. In class (II), about\na quarter of the models admit gauge coupling unification. In class (III), none\nof the models leads to gauge coupling unification. Regarding the scale of\nunification, we find values between $10^{14}$ GeV and $10^{16}$ GeV for models\nbelonging to class (I) without dark matter, whereas models in class (I) with\ndark matter as well as models of class (II) prefer values in the range $5 \\cdot\n10^{10}-5 \\cdot 10^{14}$ GeV.\n", "  Catalytically active Janus particles suspended in solution create gradients\nin the chemical composition of the solution along their surfaces, as well as\nalong any nearby container walls. The former leads to self-phoresis, while the\nlatter gives rise to chemi-osmosis, providing an additional contribution to\nself-motility. Chemi-osmosis strongly depends on the molecular interactions\nbetween the diffusing chemical species and the wall. We show analytically,\nusing an approximate \"point-particle\" approach, that by chemically patterning a\nplanar substrate one can direct the motion of Janus particles: the induced\nchemi-osmotic flows can cause particles to either \"dock\" at the chemical step\nbetween the two materials, or to follow a chemical stripe. These theoretical\npredictions are confirmed by full numerical calculations. Generically, docking\noccurs for particles which tend to move away from their catalytic caps, while\nstripe-following occurs in the opposite case. Our analysis reveals the physical\nmechanisms governing this behavior.\n", "  Localized dissipative structures (LDS) have been predicted to display a rich\narray of instabilities, yet systematic experimental studies have remained\nscarce. We have used a synchronously-driven optical fiber ring resonator to\nexperimentally study LDS instabilities in the strong-driving regime of the\nAC-driven nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation (also known as the Lugiato-Lefever\nmodel). Through continuous variation of a single control parameter, we have\nobserved a string of theoretically predicted instability modes, including\nirregular oscillations and chaotic collapses. Beyond a critical point, we\nobserve behaviour reminiscent of a phase transition: LDSs trigger localized\ndomains of spatiotemporal chaos that invade the surrounding homogeneous state.\nOur findings directly confirm a number of theoretical predictions, and they\nhighlight that complex LDS instabilities can play a role in experimental\nsystems.\n", "  We study indicators of broken time-reversal and parity symmetries in gapped\ntopological phases of matter. We focus on phases realized by Levin-Wen\nstring-net models, and generalize the string-net model to describe phases which\nbreak parity and time-reversal symmetries. We do this by introducing an extra\ndegree of freedom into the string-net graphical calculus, which takes the form\nof a branch cut located at each vertex of the underlying string-net lattice. We\nalso work with string-net graphs defined on arbitrary (non-trivalent) graphs,\nwhich reveals otherwise hidden information about certain configurations of\nanyons in the string-net graph. Most significantly, we show that objects known\nas higher Frobenius-Schur indicators can provide several efficient ways to\ndetect whether or not a given topological phase breaks parity or time-reversal\nsymmetry.\n", "  Materials with a perfect kagome lattice structure of magnetic ions are\nintensively sought for, because they may exhibit exotic ground states like the\na quantum spin liquid phase. Barlowite is a natural mineral that features\nperfect kagome layers of copper ions. However, in barlowite there are also\ncopper ions between the kagome layers, which mediate strong interkagome\ncouplings and lead to an ordered ground state. Using {\\it ab initio} density\nfunctional theory calculations we investigate whether selective isoelectronic\nsubstitution of the interlayer copper ions is feasible. After identifying\nseveral promising candidates for substitution we calculate the magnetic\nexchange couplings based on crystal structures predicted from first-principles\ncalculations. We find that isoelectronic substitution with nonmagnetic ions\nsignificantly reduces the interkagome exchange coupling. As a consequence,\ninterlayer-substituted barlowite can be described by a simple two-parameter\nHeisenberg Hamiltonian, for which a quantum spin liquid ground state has been\npredicted.\n", "  We demonstrate an experimental method for measuring energy-time entanglement\nover almost 80 nm spectral bandwidth in a single shot with a quantum bit error\nrate below 0.5%. Our scheme is extremely cost-effective and efficient in terms\nof resources as it employs only one source of entangled photons and one fixed\nunbalanced interferometer per phase-coded analysis basis. We show that the\nmaximum analysis spectral bandwidth is obtained when the analysis\ninterferometers are properly unbalanced, a strategy which can be\nstraightforwardly applied to most of today's experiments based on energy-time\nand time-bin entanglement. Our scheme has therefore a great potential for\nboosting bit rates and reducing the resource overhead of future\nentanglement-based quantum key distribution systems.\n", "  Measurements of distributions of charged particles produced in proton-proton\ncollisions with a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV are presented. The data were\nrecorded by the ATLAS detector at the LHC and correspond to an integrated\nluminosity of 151 $\\mu$b$^{-1}$. The particles are required to have a\ntransverse momentum greater than 100 MeV and an absolute pseudorapidity less\nthan 2.5. The charged-particle multiplicity, its dependence on transverse\nmomentum and pseudorapidity and the dependence of the mean transverse momentum\non multiplicity are measured in events containing at least two charged\nparticles satisfying the above kinematic criteria. The results are corrected\nfor detector effects and compared to the predictions from several Monte Carlo\nevent generators.\n", "  Point defects in solids promise precise measurements of various quantities.\nEspecially magnetic field sensing using the spin of point defects has been of\ngreat interest recently. When optical readout of spin states is used, point\ndefects achieve optical magnetic imaging with high spatial resolution at\nambient conditions. Here, we demonstrate that genuine optical vector\nmagnetometry can be realized using the silicon vacancy in SiC, which has an\nuncommon S=3/2 spin. To this end, we develop and experimentally test sensing\nprotocols based on a reference field approach combined with multi frequency\nspin excitation. Our works suggest that the silicon vacancy in an\nindustry-friendly platform, SiC, has potential for various magnetometry\napplications at ambient conditions.\n", "  Bell inequalities can be studied both as constraints in the space of\nprobability distributions and as expectation values of multipartite operators.\nThe latter approach is particularly useful when considering outcomes as\neigenvalues of unitary operators. This brings the possibility of exploiting the\ncomplex structure of the coefficients in the Bell operators. We investigate\nthis avenue of though in the known case of two outcomes, and find new Bell\ninequalities for the cases of three outcomes and $n=3,4,5$ and $6$ parties. We\nfind their corresponding classical bounds and their maximum violation in the\ncase of qutrits. We further propose a novel way to generate Bell inequalities\nbased on a mapping from maximally entangled states to Bell operators and\nproduce examples for different outcomes and number of parties.\n", "  The top quark mass is measured in the $t\\bar{t}\\to$ dilepton channel (lepton\n$= e, \\mu$) using ATLAS data recorded in the year 2012 at the LHC. The data\nwere taken at a proton--proton centre-of-mass energy of $\\sqrt{s}=$ 8 TeV and\ncorrespond to an integrated luminosity of about 20.2 fb$^{-1}$. Exploiting the\ntemplate method, and using the distribution of invariant masses of\nlepton--b-jet pairs, the top quark mass is measured to be $m_{top} =$ 172.99\n$\\pm$ 0.41 (stat) $\\pm$ 0.74 (syst) GeV, with a total uncertainty of 0.84 GeV.\nFinally, a combination with previous ATLAS $m_{top}$ measurements from\n$\\sqrt{s}=$7 TeV data in the $t\\bar{t}\\to$ dilepton and $t\\bar{t}\\to$\nlepton+jets channels results in $m_{top} =$ 172.84 $\\pm$ 0.34 (stat) $\\pm$ 0.61\n(syst) GeV, with a total uncertainty of 0.70 GeV.\n", "  We consider an $O(N)$ scalar field model with quartic interaction in\n$d$-dimensional Euclidean de Sitter space. In order to avoid the problems of\nthe standard perturbative calculations for light and massless fields, we\ngeneralize to the $O(N)$ theory a systematic method introduced previously for a\nsingle field, which treats the zero modes exactly and the nonzero modes\nperturbatively. We compute the two-point functions taking into account not only\nthe leading infrared contribution, coming from the self-interaction of the zero\nmodes, but also corrections due to the interaction of the ultraviolet modes.\nFor the model defined in the corresponding Lorentzian de Sitter spacetime, we\nobtain the two-point functions by analytical continuation. We point out that a\npartial resummation of the leading secular terms (which necessarily involves\nnonzero modes) is required to obtain a decay at large distances for massless\nfields. We implement this resummation along with a systematic double expansion\nin an effective coupling constant $\\sqrt\\lambda$ and in 1/N. We explicitly\nperform the calculation up to the next-to-next-to-leading order in\n$\\sqrt\\lambda$ and up to next-to-leading order in 1/N. The results reduce to\nthose known in the leading infrared approximation. We also show that they\ncoincide with the ones obtained directly in Lorentzian de Sitter spacetime in\nthe large N limit, provided the same renormalization scheme is used.\n", "  We present numerical evidences using overlap fermions for a scale-invariant\nbehavior of parity-invariant three-dimensional QED with two flavors of massless\ntwo-component fermions. Using finite-size scaling of the low-lying eigenvalues\nof the massless anti-Hermitian overlap Dirac operator, we rule out the presence\nof bilinear condensate and estimate the mass anomalous dimension. The\neigenvectors associated with these low-lying eigenvalues suggest critical\nbehavior in the sense of a metal-insulator transition. We show that there is no\nmass gap in the scalar and vector correlators in the infinite volume theory.\nThe vector correlator does not acquire an anomalous dimension. The anomalous\ndimension associated with the long-distance behavior of the scalar correlator\nis consistent with the mass anomalous dimension.\n", "  Correlated photon pairs produced by a spontaneous parametric down conversion\n(SPDC) process can be used for secure quantum communication over long distances\nincluding free space transmission over a link through turbulent atmosphere. We\nexperimentally investigate the possibility to utilize the intrinsic strong\ncorrelation between the pump and output photon spatial modes to mitigate the\nnegative targeting effects of atmospheric beam wander. Our approach is based on\na demonstration observing the deflection of the beam on a spatially resolved\narray of single photon avalanche diodes (SPAD-array).\n", "  The helicity eigenstates which describe the fermions with a special spin\norientation (parallel or antiparallel to the direction of momentum) provide\nconsiderable simplification in calculations. Hence, it is generally preferred\nto use helicity basis during the calculations in Relativistic Quantum Mechanics\nor Quantum Field Theory. Possibly because of the above reason, the Dirac\nspinors describing a general spin orientation have been ignored in many\ntextbooks. Although the helicity eigenstates give almost complete understanding\nof the behavior of the free Dirac solutions, the zero-mass limit is one of its\nexception. The zero-mass behavior of the free spinor with general spin\norientation and its relation with chirality eigenstates has been skipped in\ntextbooks and hence it deserves a clear, detailed investigation. In this paper\nwe obtain the free Dirac spinors describing a general spin orientation and\nexamine their zero-mass limit. We also briefly discuss some of the implications\nof this small-mass behavior of the spinors on particle physics.\n", "  When each voter rates or ranks several candidates for a single office, a\nstrong Condorcet winner (SCW) is one who beats all others in two-way races.\nAmong 21 electoral systems examined, 18 will sometimes make candidate X the\nwinner even if thousands of voters would need to change their votes to make X a\nSCW while another candidate Y could become a SCW with only one such change.\nAnalysis supports the intuitive conclusion that these 18 systems are\nunacceptable.\n  The well-known minimax system survives this test. It fails 10 others, but\nthere are good reasons to ignore all 10. Minimax-T adds a new tie-breaker. It\nsurpasses competing systems on a combination of simplicity, transparency, voter\nprivacy, input flexibility, resistance to strategic voting, and rarity of ties.\nIt allows write-ins, machine counting except for write-ins, voters who don't\nrate or rank every candidate, and tied ratings or ranks.\n  Eleven computer simulation studies used 6 different definitions (one at a\ntime) of the best candidate, and found that minimax-T always soundly beat all\nother tested systems at picking that candidate. A new maximum-likelihood\nelectoral system named CMO is the theoretically optimum system under reasonable\nconditions, but is too complex for use in real-world elections. In computer\nsimulations, minimax and minimax-T nearly always pick the same winners as CMO.\n", "  The presence of quasiparticles in superconducting qubits emerges as an\nintrinsic constraint on their coherence. While it is difficult to prevent the\ngeneration of quasiparticles, keeping them away from active elements of the\nqubit provides a viable way of improving the device performance. Here we\ndevelop theoretically and validate experimentally a model for the effect of a\nsingle small trap on the dynamics of the excess quasiparticles injected in a\ntransmon-type qubit. The model allows one to evaluate the time it takes to\nevacuate the injected quasiparticles from the transmon as a function of trap\nparameters. With the increase of the trap size, this time decreases\nmonotonically, saturating at the level determined by the quasiparticles\ndiffusion constant and the qubit geometry. We determine the characteristic trap\nsize needed for the relaxation time to approach that saturation value.\n", "  We present an analysis of 43 years (1972 to 2015) of spectroscopic\nobservations of the Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 5548. This includes 12 years of new\nunpublished observations (2003 to 2015). We compiled about 1600 H$\\beta$\nspectra and analyzed the long-term spectral variations of the 5100 \\AA\\\ncontinuum and the H$\\beta$ line. Our analysis is based on standard procedures\nincluding the Lomb-Scargle method, which is known to be rather limited to such\nheterogeneous data sets, and new method developed specifically for this project\nthat is more robust and reveals a $\\sim$5700 day periodicity in the continuum\nlight curve, the H$\\beta$ light curve and the radial velocity curve of the red\nwing of the H$\\beta$ line. The data are consistent with orbital motion inside\nthe broad emission line region of the source. We discuss several possible\nmechanisms that can explain this periodicity, including orbiting dusty and\ndust-free clouds, a binary black hole system, tidal disruption events, and the\neffect of an orbiting star periodically passing through an accretion disc.\n", "  The experimental results of Kocsis et al., Mahler et al. and the proposed\nexperiments of Morley et al. show that it is possible to construct\n\"trajectories\" in interference regions in a two-slit interferometer. These\nresults call for a theoretical re-appraisal of the notion of a \"quantum\ntrajectory\" first introduced by Dirac and in the present paper we re-examine\nthis notion from the Bohm perspective based on Hamiltonian flows. In\nparticular, we examine the short-time propagator and the role that the quantum\npotential plays in determining the form of these trajectories. These\ntrajectories differ from those produced in a typical particle tracker and the\nkey to this difference lies in the active suppression of the quantum potential\nnecessary to produce Mott-type trajectories. We show, using a rigorous\nmathematical argument, how the active suppression of this potential arises.\nFinally we discuss in detail how this suppression also accounts for the quantum\nZeno effect.\n", "  A novel numerical methodology has been developed, which makes possible to\noptimize arbitrary emitting dipole and plasmonic nano-resonator configuration\nwith an arbitrary objective function. By selecting quantum efficiency as the\nobjective function that has to be maximized at preselected Purcell factor\ncriteria, optimization of plasmonic nanorod based configurations has been\nrealized to enhance fluorescence of NV and SiV color centers in diamond. Gold\nand silver nanorod based configurations have been optimized to enhance\nexcitation and emission separately, as well as both processes simultaneously,\nand the underlying nanophotonical phenomena have been inspected comparatively.\nIt has been shown that considerable excitation enhancement is achieved by\nsilver nanorods, while nanorods made of both metals are appropriate to enhance\nemission. More significant improvement can be achieved via silver nanorods at\nboth wavelengths of both color centers. It has been proven that theoretical\nlimits originating from metal dielectric properties can be approached by\nsimultaneous optimization, which results in configurations determined by\npreferences corresponding to the emission. Larger emission enhancement is\nachieved via both metals in case of SiV center compared to the NV center. Gold\nand silver nanorod based configurations making possible to improve SiV centers\nquantum efficiency by factors of 1.18 and 5.25 are proposed, which have\npotential applications in quantum information processing.\n", "  We propose a simple $\\Delta (27) \\otimes Z_4$ model where neutrinos are\npredicted to be Dirac fermions. The smallness of their masses follows from a\ntype-I seesaw mechanism and the leptonic CP violating phase correlates with the\npattern of $\\Delta (27)$ flavor symmetry breaking. The scheme naturally harbors\na WIMP dark matter candidate associated to the Dirac nature of neutrinos, in\nthat the same $Z_4$ lepton number symmetry also ensures dark matter stability.\n", "  Gapless spin liquids have recently been observed in several frustrated Mott\ninsulators, with elementary spin excitations - \"spinons\" - reminiscent of\ndegenerate Fermi systems. However, their precise role at the Mott point, where\ncharge fluctuations begin to proliferate, remains controversial and\nill-understood. Here we present the simplest theoretical framework that treats\nthe dynamics of emergent spin and charge excitations on the same footing,\nproviding a new physical picture of the Mott metal-insulator transition at half\nfiling. We identify a generic orthogonality mechanism leading to strong damping\nof spinons, arising as soon as the Mott gap closes. Our results indicates that\nspinons should not play a significant role within the high-temperature quantum\ncritical regime above the Mott point - in striking agreement with all available\nexperiments.\n", "  The presence of non-unitary neutrino mixing can affect the measurement of the\nthree-neutrino leptonic Dirac CP phase and hamper efforts to probe CP violation\ndue to degeneracies of the extra non-unitary CP phase with the standard CP\nphase. We study the effect of including non-unitarity on probing CP violation\nwith the long-baseline experiments NO$\\nu$A, T2K and DUNE. We analyze the\neffect of non-unitary mixing at the level of oscillation probabilities\nassociated with the relevant baselines, and present the CP violation\nsensitivity for the individual experiments and their combination. Our results\nshow that there is an improvement in the CP violation sensitivity of the\ncombination compared to the individual experiments.\n", "  In a attempt to treat a supergravity as a tensor representation, the\n4-dimensional N-extended quaternionic superspaces are constructed from the\n(diffeomorphyc)graded extension of the ordinary Penrose-twistor formulation,\nperformed in a previous work of the authors[14], with N = p + k: These\nquaternionic superspaces have 4 + k (N - k) even-quaternionic coordinates and\n4N odd- quaternionic coordinates where each coordinate is a quaternion composed\nby four C-felds (bosons and fermions respectively). The fields content as the\ndimensionality (even and odd sectors) of these superspaces are given and\nexemplified by selected physical cases. In this case the number of felds of the\nsupergravity is determined by the number of components of the tensor\nrepresentation of the 4-dimensional N-extended quaternionic superspaces. The\nrole of tensorial central charges for any N even USp (N) = Sp (N;HC) \\ U (N;HC)\nis elucidated from this theoretical context.\n", "  We study the X-ray and optical properties of the ultraluminous X-ray source\n(ULX) X-6 in the nearby galaxy NGC 4258 (M106) based on the archival {\\it\nXMM-Newton}, {\\it Chandra}, {\\it Swift}, and {\\it Hubble Space Telescope} ({\\it\nHST}) observations. The source has a peak luminosity of $L_{\\mathrm{X}} \\sim 2\n\\times 10^{39}$ erg s$^{-1}$ in the {\\it XMM-Newton} observation of 2004 June.\nConsideration of the hardness ratios and spectral model parameters shows that\nthe source seems to exhibit possible spectral variations throughout the X-ray\nobservations. In the images from the {\\it HST}/Advanced Camera for Surveys\n(ACS), three optical sources have been identified as counterpart candidates\nwithin the 1$\\sigma$ error radius of 0$\\arcsec$.3. The brightest one has an\nabsolute magnitude of $M_{V} \\approx$ $-$7.0 and shows extended structure. The\nremaining two sources have absolute magnitudes of $M_{V} \\approx$ $-$5.8 and\n$-$5.3 mag. The possible spectral types of the candidates from brightest to\ndimmest were determined as B6$-$A5, B0$-$A7, and B2$-$A3, respectively. The\ncounterparts of the X-ray source possibly belong to a young star cluster.\nNeither the standard disk model nor the slim disk model provides firm evidence\nto determine the spectral characteristics of ULX X-6. We argue that the mass of\nthe compact object lies in the range $10-15M_{\\sun}$ indicating that the\ncompact source is most likely a stellar-mass black hole.\n", "  The second-order vector mode is inevitably induced from the coupling of\nfirst-order scalar modes in cosmological perturbation theory and might hinder a\npossible detection of primordial gravitational waves from inflation through\n21cm lensing observations. Here, we investigate the weak lensing signal in 21cm\nphotons emitted by neutral hydrogen atoms in the dark ages induced by the\nsecond-order vector mode by decomposing the deflection angle of the 21cm\nlensing signal into the gradient and curl modes. The curl mode is a good tracer\nof the cosmological vector and tensor modes since the scalar mode does not\ninduce the curl one. By comparing angular power spectra of the 21cm lensing\ncurl mode induced by the second-order vector mode and primordial gravitational\nwaves whose amplitude is parametrized by the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$, we\nfind that the 21cm curl mode from the second-order vector mode dominates over\nthat from primordial gravitational waves on almost all scales if $r \\lesssim\n10^{-5}$. If we use the multipoles of the power spectrum up to $\\ell_{\\rm max}\n= 10^{5}$ and $10^{6}$ in reconstructing the curl mode from 21cm temperature\nmaps, the signal-to-noise ratios of the 21cm curl mode from the second-order\nvector mode achieve ${\\rm S/N} \\approx 0.46$ and $73$, respectively.\nObservation of 21cm radiation is, in principle, a powerful tool to explore not\nonly the tensor mode but also the cosmological vector mode.\n", "  In this paper, we revisit the lattice vibration of one-dimensional monatomic\nlinear chain under open and periodic boundary conditions, and give the exact\nconditions for the emergence of the local vibration mode when one of the atoms\nis replaced by an impurity. Our motivation is twofold. Firstly, in deriving the\ndispersion relation of the atoms, periodic boundary condition is overwhelmingly\nutilized while open boundary condition is seldomly referred. Therefore we\nmanage to obtain the dispersion relation under both boundary conditions\nsimultaneously by Molinari formula. Secondly, in the presence of impurity,\nlocal vibration mode can emerge as long as the mass of the impurity $m'$ is\nsmaller than the mass of the perfect atom $m$ to certain degree, which can be\nmeasured by the mass ratio $\\delta=\\frac{m-m'}{m}$. At periodic boundary\ncondition, the critical mass ratio is $0$ or $\\frac{1}{N}$, depending on\nwhether the length $N$ of the chain is even or odd. At open boundary condition,\nthe critical mass ratio is $\\frac{N}{2N-1}$ if the impurity locates at the end\nof the chain, while it is $\\frac{N}{(2N_l+1)(2N_r+1)}$ with $N_l$ and $N_r$ be\nthe number of atoms at the left and right hand sides of the impurity if the\nimpurity locates at the middle.\n", "  We construct UV-complete models for non-standard neutrino interactions\nmediated by a sub-GeV gauge boson Z' coupled to baryon number $B$ or $B-L$. A\nflavor-dependent Z' coupling to neutrinos is induced by mixing a U(1)'-charged\nDirac fermion with the active neutrinos, naturally suppressing flavor violation\nor non-universality of the charged leptons to the loop level. We show that\nthese models can give rise to large flavor-conserving as well as\nflavor-violating non-standard neutral-current neutrino interactions potentially\nobservable in current or future oscillation experiments such as DUNE without\nbeing in conflict with other constraints such as neutrino scattering or\nlepton-flavor-violating decays. In particular, the LMA-Dark solution to the\nsolar-neutrino anomaly can be obtained for $U(1)_B$, but not for $U(1)_{B-L}$.\n", "  We present, experimentally and theoretically, a scheme for dressed-state\nelectromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) in a three-step cascade system\nwhere a four-level system is mapped into an effective three-level system.\nTheoretical analysis reveals that the scheme provides coherent state control\nvia adiabatic following and provides a generalized protocol for light storage\nin uniform phase spin-waves that are insensitive to motional dephasing. The\nthree-step driving enables a number of other features including spatial\nselectivity of the excitation region within the atomic medium, and kick-free\nand Doppler-free excitation that produces narrow resonances in thermal vapor.\nAs a proof of concept we present an experimental demonstration of the\ngeneralized EIT scheme using the $6S_{1/2} \\rightarrow 6P_{3/2} \\rightarrow\n7S_{1/2} \\rightarrow 8P_{1/2}$ excitation path in thermal cesium vapor. This\ntechnique could be applied to cold and thermal ensembles to enable longer\nstorage times for Rydberg polaritons.\n", "  Integrated optical components on lithium niobate play a major role in\nstandard high-speed communication systems. Over the last two decades, after the\nbirth and positioning of quantum information science, lithium niobate waveguide\narchitectures have emerged as one of the key platforms for enabling photonics\nquantum technologies. Due to mature technological processes for waveguide\nstructure integration, as well as inherent and efficient properties for\nnonlinear optical effects, lithium niobate devices are nowadays at the heart of\nmany photon-pair or triplet sources, single-photon detectors, coherent\nwavelength-conversion interfaces, and quantum memories. Consequently, they find\napplications in advanced and complex quantum communication systems, where\ncompactness, stability, efficiency, and interconnectability with other\nguided-wave technologies are required. In this review paper, we first introduce\nthe material aspects of lithium niobate, and subsequently discuss all of the\nabove mentioned quantum components, ranging from standard photon-pair sources\nto more complex and advanced circuits.\n", "  A quantum thermodynamic cycle with a chiral multiferroic working substance\nsuch as $\\textrm{LiCu}_{2}\\textrm{O}_{2}$ is presented. Shortcuts to\nadiabaticity are employed to achieve an efficient, finite time quantum\nthermodynamic cycle which is found to depend on the spin ordering. The emergent\nelectric polarization associated with the chiral spin order, i.e. the\nmagnetoelectric coupling, renders possible steering of the spin order by an\nexternal electric field and hence renders possible an electric-field control of\nthe cycle. Due to the intrinsic coupling between of the spin and the electric\npolarization, the cycle performs an electro-magnetic work. We determine this\nwork's mean square fluctuations, the irreversible work, and the output power of\nthe cycle. We observe that the work mean square fluctuations are increased with\nthe duration of the adiabatic strokes while the irreversible work and the\noutput power of the cycle show a non-monotonic behavior. In particular the\nirreversible work vanishes at the end of the quantum adiabatic strokes. This\nfact confirms that the cycle is reversible. Our theoretical findings evidence\nthe existence of a system inherent maximal output power. By implementing a\nLindblad master equation we quantify the role of thermal relaxations on the\ncycle efficiency. We also discuss the role of entanglement encoded in the\nnon-collinear spin order as a resource to affect the quantum thermodynamic\ncycle.\n", "  The interaction potential between two colloidal particles typically spans a\nfew nanometers. Hence the correct appraisal of the potential in simulations\nrequires very short time steps. However, it is often possible to combine one\nmany-particle calculation with several two-particle simulations in order to\nestimate a set of aggregation rates. As in the theory of Fuchs, this procedure\ncombines the evaluation of the fastest flocculation rate with the calculation\nof several stability ratios. This methodology was already tested in systems\nwhich exhibit low repulsive barriers for primary minimum flocculation. In this\narticle, the procedure is modified in order to calculate an average rate for\nsecondary minimum flocculation. The technique is then used to estimate the\ninfluence of drop deformation on the aggregation rate of hexadecane-in-water\nnano-emulsions stabilized with sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS).\n", "  Extinction curves, especially those in the Milky Way (MW), the Large\nMagellanic Cloud (LMC), and the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), have provided us\nwith a clue to the dust properties in the nearby Universe. We examine whether\nor not these extinction curves can be explained by well known dust evolution\nprocesses. We treat the dust production in stellar ejecta, destruction in\nsupernova shocks, dust growth by accretion and coagulation, and dust disruption\nby shattering. To make a survey of the large parameter space possible, we\nsimplify the treatment of the grain size distribution evolution by adopting the\n`two-size approximation', in which we divide the grain population into small\n($\\lesssim 0.03~\\mu$m) and large ($\\gtrsim 0.03~\\mu$m) grains. It is confirmed\nthat the MW extinction curve can be reproduced in reasonable ranges for the\ntime-scale of the above processes with a silicate-graphite mixture. This\nindicates that the MW extinction curve is a natural consequence of the dust\nevolution through the above processes. We also find that the same models fail\nto reproduce the SMC/LMC extinction curves. Nevertheless, this failure can be\nremedied by giving higher supernova destruction rates for small carbonaceous\ndust and considering amorphous carbon for carbonaceous dust; these modification\nfall in fact in line with previous studies. Therefore, we conclude that the\ncurrent dust evolution scenario composed of the aforementioned processes is\nsuccessful in explaining the extinction curves. All the extinction curves favor\nefficient interstellar processing of dust, especially, strong grain growth by\naccretion and coagulation.\n", "  The occurrence and frequency of a phenomenon of resonance (namely the\ncoalescence of some Dubrovin canonical coordinates) in the locus of Small\nQuantum Cohomology of complex Grassmannians is studied. It is shown that\nsurprisingly this frequency is strictly subordinate and highly influenced by\nthe distribution of prime numbers. Two equivalent formulations of the Riemann\nHypothesis are given in terms of numbers of complex Grassmannians without\ncoalescence: the former as a constraint on the disposition of singularities of\nthe analytic continuation of the Dirichlet series associated to the sequence\ncounting non-coalescing Grassmannians, the latter as asymptotic estimate (whose\nerror term cannot be improved) for their distribution function.\n", "  An effective Lagrangian term for the electron magnetic moment, and more\ngenerally electromagnetic form factors, is calculated by considering the\nbackground field method. Two Fierz transformations are performed for a\none-photon exchange interaction, and the ambiguity in doing such\ntransformations is exploited. The resulting effective interaction may exhibit\nan approximated rotational chiral symmetry either for the scalar-pseudoscalar\ncurrents interaction or for the vector-axial currents interaction. The leading\nterms in the expansion of the fermion determinant yield the leading QED\neffective action with the complete one loop electromagnetic form factors. A\nmodel is proposed to produce the tree level magnetic moment term.\n", "  We apply our model of quantum gravity to an AdS black hole resulting in a\nwave equation in a quantum spacetime which has a sequence of solutions that can\nbe expressed as a product of stationary and temporal eigenfunctions. The\nstationary eigenfunctions can be interpreted as radiation and the temporal as\ngravitational waves. The event horizon corresponds in the quantum model to a\nCauchy hypersurface that can be crossed by causal curves in both directions\nsuch that the information paradox does not occur.\n", "  The presence of dark matter in the universe is nowadays supported by a\nsubstantial set of astronomical and cosmological observations. A large amount\nof dark matter is expected in the Galactic Center (GC) region. Thanks also to\nits proximity, it is one of the best targets to look for dark matter particle\nself-annihilation into very high energy gamma-rays. We perform a search for\nannihilating dark matter in the central 300 parsecs around the GC with the\nH.E.S.S. array of ground-based Cherenkov telescopes. Using the full H.E.S.S.- I\ndataset (2004-2014) of GC observations, new constraints are derived on the\nvelocity-weighted annihilation cross section $\\langle \\sigma v \\rangle$ with a\n2D likelihood method using spectral and spatial morphologies of the DM signal\ncompared to background. These constraints are the strongest obtained so far in\nthe TeV mass range and improve the previous constraints by a factor of 5.\nConsidering an Einasto profile, the constraints reach $\\langle \\sigma v\n\\rangle$ values of $6\\times 10^{-26}$cm$^{3}$s$^{-1}$ for a DM particle mass of\n1.5 TeV annihilation into W$^+$W$^-$ pairs. In the $\\tau^+\\tau^-$ channel, the\nconstraints probe the natural scale for thermal relic cross section for DM\nparticles of masses between 400 GeV and 2 TeV.\n", "  The low mass X-ray binary Aquila X-1 is one of the most active neutron star\nX-ray transients. Despite it has a relatively bright quiescent optical\ncounterpart, the detection of its companion has been hampered by the presence\nof a nearby interloper star. Using the infrared integral field spectrograph\nSINFONI on the VLT-8.2m telescope, we unambiguously single out Aquila X-1 from\nthe interloper. Phase-resolved near infrared spectroscopy reveals absorption\nfeatures from a K4 +- 2 companion star moving at a projected velocity of K_2=\n136 +- 4 km/s. We here present the first dynamical solution and associated\nfundamental parameters of Aquila X-1, imposing new constraints to the orbital\ninclination (36 deg < i < 47 deg) and the distance (d = 6 +- 2 kpc) to this\nprototypical neutron star transient.\n", "  In this paper, $E_6$ and especially $E_7$ GUT are considered in the F-theory\nsetting in view of the free fermionic construction of the $4D$ heterotic\nstring. In particular, the NAHE-Based LRS model of \\cite{Cleaver:2000ds,\nCleaver:2002ps} is revisited as an illustration where the starting point was\ntaken to be the $N=4$, $E_7 \\times E_7 \\times SO(16)$ which through the use of\nboundary condition basis vectors is reduced to obtain the flipped $SO(10)$ GUT\nsymmetry.\n  We also seek to extend the results of \\cite{Faraggi:2002ah} in the case of\nthe flipped $SU(5)$ to home in on the flipped $SO(10)$ vacua from the\nHor\\v{a}va-Witten theory where the $E_8$ gauge group on the observable sector\ndecomposes as $E_{8}\\supset E_{6}\\times SU(3)$ with $E_{6}$ being the gauge\ngroup of the effective field theory. We find for the $E_{6}$ GUT symmetry,\nsolutions of type A and solutions of type B where the Hirzebruch surfaces are\nconsidered for the base contrary to \\cite{Faraggi:2002ah} where flipped $SU(5)$\nvacua were studied and only solutions of type B were found. Moreover, no\nsolutions are found in the case of the base being the del Pezzo surfaces.\nFurthermore, this goes hand in hand with the heterotic, low-energy\nstring-derived effective model discussed in\n\\cite{Ashfaque:2016psv,Ashfaque:2016ydg}.\n", "  The interplay of electronic band structures and electron-electron\ninteractions is known to brew new phases in condensed matter. In this paper, we\ninvestigate thermodynamic phases and corresponding electronic structures of the\nWeyl semimetal in the strong onsite Coulomb interaction limit. Based on a\nminimum model of the Weyl semimetal with two linear Weyl nodes, it is shown\nthat generically the Weyl semimetal becomes magnetic in the presence of\ninteractions. In particular, it is shown that the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya\nexchange interaction is generally induced so that the A-type antiferromagnetic\n(A-AFM) phase and the spiral spin density wave (SSDW) states are two generic\nphases. Furthermore, we find that Weyl nodes proliferate and it is possible to\ndoubly enhance the unusual properties of non-interacting Weyl semimetals\nthrough the realization of double-Weyl nodes in strong correlation limit.\nSpecifically, it is shown that in the SSDW phase, linear Weyl nodes are tuned\ninto double-Weyl nodes with the corresponding charges being $\\pm 2$. As the\nspin-orbit coupling increases, a quantum phase transition occurs with the SSDW\nphase being turned into an A-AFM phase and at the same time, double-Weyl nodes\nare disintegrated into two pairs of linear Weyl nodes. Our results reveal the\nunusual interplay between the topology of electronic structures and magnetism\nin strongly correlated phases of Weyl semimetals.\n", "  Background rejection is key to success for future neutrinoless double beta\ndecay experiments. To achieve sensitivity to effective Majorana lifetimes of\n$\\sim10^{28}$ years, backgrounds must be controlled to better than 0.1 count\nper ton per year, beyond the reach of any present technology. In this paper we\npropose a new method to identify the birth of the barium daughter ion in the\nneutrinoless double beta decay of $^{136}$Xe. The method adapts Single Molecule\nFluorescent Imaging, a technique from biochemistry research with demonstrated\nsingle ion sensitivity. We explore possible SMFI dyes suitable for the problem\nof barium ion detection in high pressure xenon gas, and develop a fiber-coupled\nsensing system with which we can detect the presence of bulk Ba$^{++}$ ions\nremotely. We show that our sensor produces signal-to-background ratios as high\nas 85 in response to Ba$^{++}$ ions when operated in aqueous solution. We then\ndescribe the next stage of this R\\&D program, which will be to demonstrate\nchelation and fluorescence in xenon gas. If a successful barium ion tag can be\ndeveloped using SMFI adapted for high pressure xenon gas detectors, the first\nessentially zero background, ton-scale neutrinoless double beta decay\ntechnology could be realized.\n", "  We use molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the tracer diffusion in\na sea of polymers with specific binding zones for the tracer. These binding\nzones act as traps. Our simulations show that the tracer can undergo normal yet\nnon-Gaussian diffusion under certain circumstances, e.g, when the polymers with\ntraps are frozen in space and the volume fraction and the binding strength of\nthe traps are moderate. In this case, as the tracer moves, it experiences a\nheterogeneous environment and exhibits confined continuous time random walk\n(CTRW) like motion resulting a non-Gaussian behavior. Also the long time\ndynamics becomes subdiffusive as the number or the binding strength of the\ntraps increases. However, if the polymers are mobile then the tracer dynamics\nis Gaussian but could be normal or subdiffusive depending on the number and the\nbinding strength of the traps. In addition, with increasing binding strength\nand the number of the polymer traps, the probability of the tracer being\ntrapped increases. On the other hand, removing the binding zones does not\nresult trapping, even at comparatively high crowding. Our simulations also show\nthat the trapping probability increases with the increasing size of the tracer\nand for a bigger tracer with the frozen polymer background the dynamics is only\nweakly non-Gaussian but highly subdiffusive. Our observations are in the same\nspirit as found in many recent experiments on tracer diffusion in polymeric\nmaterials and questions the validity of Gaussian theory to describe diffusion\nin crowded environment in general.\n", "  A systematic study on the alpha decay half lives of various isotopes of\nsuperheavy element \\textit{Z} = 121 within the range 290 $\\leq$ A $\\leq$ 339 is\npresented for the first time using Coulomb and proximity potential model for\ndeformed nuclei (CPPMDN). The calculated $\\alpha$ decay half lives of the\nisotopes within our formalism match well with the values computed using\nViola-Seaborg systematic, Universal curve of Poenaru et al., and the analytical\nformula of Royer. In our study by comparing the $\\alpha$ decay half lives with\nthe spontaneous fission half lives, we have predicted $2\\alpha$ chain from\n$^{309, 311, 312}$121, $3\\alpha$ chain from $^{310}$121 and $1\\alpha$ chain\nfrom $^{313, 314}$121. Clearly our study shows that the isotopes of superheavy\nelement \\textit{Z} = 121 within the mass range 309 $\\leq$ A $\\leq$ 314 will\nsurvive fission and can be synthesized and detected in the laboratory via alpha\ndecay. We hope that our predictions will provide a new guide to future\nexperiments.\n", "  When two objects have gravitational interaction between them, they are no\nlonger independent of each other. In fact, there exists gravitational\ncorrelation between these two objects. Inspired by E. Verlinde's paper, we\nfirst calculate the entropy change of a system when gravity does positive work\non this system. Based on the concept of gravitational correlation entropy, we\nprove that the entropy of a Schwarzschild black hole originates from the\ngravitational correlations between the interior matters of the black hole. By\nanalyzing the gravitational correlation entropies in the process of Hawking\nradiation in a general context, we prove that the reduced entropy of a black\nhole is exactly carried away by the radiation and the gravitational\ncorrelations between these radiating particles, and the entropy or information\nis conserved at all times during Hawking radiation. Finally, we attempt to give\na unified description of the non-extensive black-hole entropy and the extensive\nentropy of ordinary matter.\n", "  Protein binding often involves conformational changes. Important questions\nare whether a conformational change occurs prior to a binding event\n('conformational selection') or after a binding event ('induced fit'), and how\nconformational transition rates can be obtained from experiments. In this\narticle, we present general results for the chemical relaxation rates of\nconformational-selection and induced-fit binding processes that hold for all\nconcentrations of proteins and ligands and, thus, go beyond the standard\npseudo-first-order approximation of large ligand concentration. These results\nallow to distinguish conformational-selection from induced-fit processes - also\nin cases in which such a distinction is not possible under pseudo-first-order\nconditions - and to extract conformational transition rates of proteins from\nchemical relaxation data.\n", "  Rashba spin-orbit splitting in the magnetic materials opens up a new\nperspective in the field of spintronics. Here, we report a giant Rashba-type\nspin-orbit effect on PrGe [010] surface in the paramagnetic phase with Rashba\ncoefficient {\\alpha}_R=5 eV{\\AA}. Significant changes in the electronic band\nstructure has been observed across the phase transitions from paramagnetic to\nantiferromagnetic (44 K) and from antiferromagnetic to the ferromagnetic ground\nstate (41.5 K). We find that Pr 4f states in PrGe is strongly hybridized with\nthe Pr 5d and Ge 4s-4p states near the Fermi level. The behavior of Rashba\neffect is found to be different in the k_x and the k_y directions showing\nelectron-like and the hole-like bands, respectively. The possible origin of\nRashba effect in the paramagnetic phase is related to the anti-parallel spin\npolarization present in this system. First-principles density functional\ncalculations of Pr terminated surface with the anti-parallel spins shows a fair\nagreement with the experimental results. We find that the anti-parallel spins\nare strongly coupled to the lattice such that the PrGe system behaves like weak\nferromagnetic system. Analysis of the energy dispersion curves at different\nmagnetic phases showed that there is a competition between the\nDzyaloshinsky-Moriya interaction and the exchange interaction which gives rise\nto the magnetic ordering in PrGe. Supporting evidences of the presence of\nDzyaloshinsky-Moriya interaction are observed as anisotropic magnetoresistance\nwith respect to field direction and first-order type hysteresis in the X-ray\ndiffraction measurements. A giant negative magnetoresistance of 43% in the\nantiferromagnetic phase and tunable Rashba parameter with temperature across\nthe magnetic transitions makes this material a suitable candidate for\ntechnological application in the antiferromagnetic spintronic devices.\n", "  The recent discovery of an enriched metallicity for the Smith high-velocity\nHI cloud (SC) lends support to a Galactic origin for this system. We use a\ndynamical model of the galactic fountain to reproduce the observed properties\nof the SC. In our model, fountain clouds are ejected from the region of the\ndisc spiral arms and move through the halo interacting with a pre-existing hot\ncorona. We find that a simple model where cold gas outflows vertically from the\nPerseus spiral arm reproduces the kinematics and the distance of the SC, but is\nin disagreement with the cloud's cometary morphology, if this is produced by\nram-pressure stripping by the ambient gas. To explain the cloud morphology we\nexplore two scenarios: a) the outflow is inclined with respect to the vertical\ndirection; b) the cloud is entrained by a fast wind that escapes an underlying\nsuperbubble. Solutions in agreement with all observational constraints can be\nfound for both cases, the former requires outflow angles >40 deg while the\nlatter requires >1000 km/s winds. All scenarios predict that the SC is in the\nascending phase of its trajectory and have large - but not implausible - energy\nrequirements.\n", "  The Gaia team has applied a renormalization to their internally-derived\nparallax errors $\\sigma_{\\rm int}(\\pi)$ $$ \\sigma_{tgas}(\\pi) =\n\\sqrt{[A\\sigma_{int}(\\pi)]^2 + \\sigma_0^2}; \\ \\ \\ \\ (A,\\sigma_0) = (1.4,0.20\\\n\\rm mas) $$ based on comparison to Hipparcos astrometry. We use a completely\nindependent method based on the RR Lyrae $K$-band period-luminosity relation to\nderive a substantially different result, with smaller ultimate errors $$\n(A,\\sigma_0) = (1.1,0.12\\ \\rm mas) \\ \\ \\ \\ (this\\ paper). $$ We argue that our\nestimate is likely to be more accurate and therefore that the reported TGAS\nparallax errors should be reduced according to the prescription: $$\n\\sigma_{true}(\\pi) = \\sqrt{(0.79\\sigma_{tgas}(\\pi))^2 - (0.10\\ \\rm mas)^2}. $$\n", "  We review our current understanding of the interior structure and thermal\nevolution of Saturn, with a focus on recent results in the Cassini era. There\nhas been important progress in understanding physical inputs, including\nequations of state of planetary materials and their mixtures, physical\nparameters like the gravity field and rotation rate, and constraints on\nSaturnian free oscillations. At the same time, new methods of calculation,\nincluding work on the gravity field of rotating fluid bodies, and the role of\ninterior composition gradients, should help to better constrain the state of\nSaturn's interior, now and earlier in its history. However, a better\nappreciation of modeling uncertainties and degeneracies, along with a greater\nexploration of modeling phase space, still leave great uncertainties in our\nunderstanding of Saturn's interior. Further analysis of Cassini data sets, as\nwell as precise gravity field measurements from the Cassini Grand Finale\norbits, will further revolutionize our understanding of Saturn's interior over\nthe next few years.\n", "  Since the mid-1980s the shock-in-jet model has been the preferred paradigm to\nexplain radio-band flaring in blazar jets. We describe our radiative transfer\nmodel incorporating relativistically-propagating shocks, and illustrate how the\n4.8, 8, and 14.5 GHz linear polarization and total flux density data from the\nUniversity of Michigan monitoring program, in combination with the model,\nconstrain jet flow conditions and shock attributes. Results from strong\nFermi-era flares in 4 blazars with widely-ranging properties are presented.\nAdditionally, to investigate jet evolution on decadal time scales we analyze 3\noutbursts in OT 081 spanning nearly 3 decades and find intrinsic changes\nattributable to flow changes at a common spatial location, or, alternatively,\nto a change in the jet segment viewed. The model's success in reproducing these\ndata supports a scenario in which relativistic shocks compress a plasma with an\nembedded passive, initially-turbulent magnetic field, with additional ordered\nmagnetic field components, one of which may be helical.\n", "  Given a nonnegative matrix $A$, can you find diagonal matrices $D_1,~D_2$\nsuch that $D_1AD_2$ is doubly stochastic? The answer to this question is known\nas Sinkhorn's theorem. It has been proved with a wide variety of methods, each\npresenting a variety of possible generalisations. Recently, generalisations\nsuch as to positive maps between matrix algebras have become more and more\ninteresting for applications. This text gives a review of over 70 years of\nmatrix scaling. The focus lies on the mathematical landscape surrounding the\nproblem and its solution as well as the generalisation to positive maps and\ncontains hardly any nontrivial unpublished results.\n", "  Surface codes exploit topological protection to increase error resilience in\nquantum computing devices and can in principle be implemented in existing\nhardware. They are one of the most promising candidates for active error\ncorrection, not least due to a polynomial-time decoding algorithm which admits\none of the highest predicted error thresholds. We consider the dependence of\nthis threshold on underlying assumptions including different noise models, and\nanalyze the performance of a minimum weight perfect matching (MWPM) decoding\ncompared to a mathematically optimal maximum likelihood (ML) decoding. Our ML\nalgorithm tracks the success probabilities for all possible corrections over\ntime and accounts for individual gate failure probabilities and error\npropagation due to the syndrome measurement circuit. We present the very first\nevidence for the true error threshold of an optimal circuit level decoder,\nallowing us to draw conclusions about what kind of improvements are possible\nover standard MWPM.\n", "  Based on the Szekeres-Pirani gravitational compass we suggest the addition of\na fourth, non-coplanar mass/mirror to the presently existing laser based\ngravitational wave observatories, enabling them to operate omnidirectionally,\nto filter out ambiguous interpretations and to point out the direction of the\ngravitational wave source.\n", "  We report a measurement of the time-integrated $CP$ asymmetry in the neutral\ncharm meson decay $D^0 \\to K^0_S K^0_S$ using 921~fb$^{-1}$ data collected at\nthe $\\Upsilon(4S)$ and $\\Upsilon(5S)$ resonances with the Belle detector at the\nKEKB asymmetric-energy $e^+e^-$ collider. The observed asymmetry is $$\nA_{CP}(D^0 \\to K^0_S K^0_S) = (-0.02 \\pm 1.53 \\pm 0.17) \\%, $$ where the first\nuncertainty is statistical and the second systematic. This latter uncertainty\nis dominated by the error of the normalisation channel. The result is\nconsistent with Standard Model expectations and improves the uncertainty with\nrespect to previous measurement of this quantity by more than a factor of\nthree.\n", "  For any practical superconductor the magnitude of the critical current\ndensity, $J_\\textrm{c}$, is crucially important. It sets the upper limit for\ncurrent in the conductor. Usually $J_\\textrm{c}$ falls rapidly with increasing\nexternal magnetic field but even in zero external field the current flowing in\nthe conductor generates a self-field which limits $J_\\textrm{c}$. Here we show\nfor thin films of thickness less than the London penetration depth, $\\lambda$,\nthis limiting $J_\\textrm{c}$ adopts a universal value for all superconductors -\nmetals, oxides, cuprates, pnictides, borocarbides and heavy Fermions. For type\nI superconductors, it is $H_{\\textrm{c}}/\\lambda$ where $H_\\textrm{c}$ is the\nthermodynamic critical field. But surprisingly for type II superconductors we\nfind the self-field $J_\\textrm{c}$ is $H_{\\textrm{c}1}/\\lambda$ where\n$H_{\\textrm{c}1}$ is the lower critical field. $J_\\textrm{c}$ is thus\nfundamentally determined and this provides a simple means to extract absolute\nvalues of $\\lambda(T)$ and, from its temperature dependence, the symmetry and\nmagnitude of the superconducting gap.\n", "  We propose a sparse regression method capable of discovering the governing\npartial differential equation(s) of a given system by time series measurements\nin the spatial domain. The regression framework relies on sparsity promoting\ntechniques to select the nonlinear and partial derivative terms terms of the\ngoverning equations that most accurately represent the data, bypassing a\ncombinatorially large search through all possible candidate models. The method\nbalances model complexity and regression accuracy by selecting a parsimonious\nmodel via Pareto analysis. Time series measurements can be made in an Eulerian\nframework where the sensors are fixed spatially, or in a Lagrangian framework\nwhere the sensors move with the dynamics. The method is computationally\nefficient, robust, and demonstrated to work on a variety of canonical problems\nof mathematical physics including Navier-Stokes, the quantum harmonic\noscillator, and the diffusion equation. Moreover, the method is capable of\ndisambiguating between potentially non-unique dynamical terms by using multiple\ntime series taken with different initial data. Thus for a traveling wave, the\nmethod can distinguish between a linear wave equation or the Korteweg-deVries\nequation, for instance. The method provides a promising new technique for\ndiscovering governing equations and physical laws in parametrized\nspatio-temporal systems where first-principles derivations are intractable.\n", "  In the present work, we have considered minimal unitarity violation(MUV)\nscheme, to obtain the general expression for $\\nu_{\\mu}\\rightarrow\\nu_{\\tau}$\noscillation probability, in vacuum. For this channel, we have investigated the\nsensitivities to non-unitary parameters $|\\rho_{\\mu\\tau}|$ and\n$\\omega_{\\mu\\tau}$ with short baseline(SBL) experiments for normal as well as\ninverted hierarchical neutrino masses. We also check how the sensitivity to\nnon-unitary parameters get modified for $\\theta_{23}$ above and below\nmaximality. We find that the $3\\sigma$ sensitivity towards $|\\rho_{\\mu\\tau}|$\nis maximum for non-unitary phase $\\omega_{\\mu\\tau}=0$, whereas it is minimum\nfor $\\omega_{\\mu\\tau}=\\pm\\pi$ in case of normal hierarchy(NH). However, the\nsensitivity is minimum at $\\omega_{\\mu\\tau}=0$ and maximum for\n$\\omega_{\\mu\\tau}=\\pm\\pi$ for inverted hierarchy(IH). We observe that for\nunitary $CP$ phase $\\delta=0$ and $\\delta=\\pi/2$, the sensitivity to measure\nnon-unitarity remains same in both the cases. We, also, explore wide range of\n$L/E$ to forecast, in principle, the possibilities to observe $CP$-violation\ndue to unitary($\\delta$) and non-unitary($\\omega_{\\mu\\tau}$) phases. We find\nthat the both phases can be disentangled, in principle, from each other, for\nthe $L/E$ range less than 200 km/GeV for $\\nu_{\\mu}\\rightarrow\\nu_{\\tau}$\nchannel.\n", "  A composite porous polymer membrane with aligned CNTs in its matrix is\ndeveloped which exhibits programmable, anisotropic actuation towards organic\nvapors. The alignment of CNTs in multiple directions and the gradient porous\nstructure of the membrane are critical for the actuation, and the actuating\ndirection can be well controlled at a direction perpendicular to the\nlongitudinal orientation of CNTs. The reversible actuation may be repeated for\n300 cycles without obvious fatigue. These polymer composites are promising\nbuilding blocks for a wide variety of applications such as sensors and\nactuators. The concept of programmable actuation succeeded here in a porous\npolymer mateial via complex orientation of CNTs reflects a new high level of\ncontrol over physical motions that is applicable to a broad range of soft\nactuators.\n", "  We report on observations obtained at IRAM on two semi-regular variable\nAsymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars, RS Cnc and EP Aqr, undergoing mass loss at\nan intermediate rate of ~ 10^-7 solar mass per year. Interferometric data\nobtained with the Plateau-de-Bure interferometer (NOEMA) have been combined\nwith On-The-Fly maps obtained with the 30-m telescope in the CO(1-0) and (2-1)\nrotational lines. The spectral maps of spatially resolved sources reveal an\naxisymmetric morphology in which matter is flowing out at a low velocity (~ 2\nkm/s) in the equatorial planes, and at a larger velocity (~ 8 km/s) along the\npolar axes. There are indications that this kind of morpho-kinematics is\nrelatively frequent among stars at the beginning of their evolution on the\nThermally-Pulsing AGB, in particular among those that show composite CO line\nprofiles, and that it might be caused by the presence of a companion. We\ndiscuss the progress that could be expected for our understanding of the mass\nloss mechanisms in this kind of sources by increasing the spatial resolution of\nthe observations with ALMA or NOEMA.\n", "  We report a giant thermal shift of $2.1 \\,$MHz/K related to the excited-state\nzero-field splitting in the silicon vacancy centers in 4H silicon carbide. It\nis obtained from the indirect observation of the optically detected magnetic\nresonance in the excited state using the ground state as an ancilla.\nAlternatively, relative variations of the zero-field splitting for small\ntemperature differences can be detected without application of radiofrequency\nfields, by simply monitoring the photoluminescence intensity in the vicinity of\nthe level anticrossing. This effect results in an all-optical thermometry\ntechnique with temperature sensitivity of $100 \\,$mK/Hz$^{1/2}$ for a detection\nvolume of approximately $10^{-6} \\,$mm$^{3}$. In contrast, the zero-field\nsplitting in the ground state does not reveal detectable temperature shift.\nUsing these properties, an integrated magnetic field and temperature sensor can\nbe implemented on the same center.\n", "  We give an explicit construction for a quantum observer coherently mimicking\nthe dynamics of a cavity mode system and without any disturbance of the\nsystem's dynamics. This gives the exact analogue of the Luenberger observer\nused in controller design in engineering\n", "  The mechanism behind the shaping of bipolar planetary nebulae is still poorly\nunderstood. Accurately tracing the molecule-rich equatorial regions of post-AGB\nstars can give valuable insight into the ejection mechanisms at work. We\ninvestigate the physical conditions, structure and velocity field of the dense\nmolecular region of the planetary nebula NGC 6302 by means of ALMA band 7\ninterferometric maps. The high spatial resolution of the $^{12}$CO and\n$^{13}$CO J=3-2 ALMA data allows for an analysis of the geometry of the ejecta\nin unprecedented detail. We built a spatio-kinematical model of the molecular\nregion with the software SHAPE and performed detailed non-LTE calculations of\nexcitation and radiative transfer with the SHAPEMOL plug-in. We find that the\nmolecular region consists of a massive ring out of which a system of fragments\nof lobe walls emerge and enclose the base of the lobes visible in the optical.\nThe general properties of this region are in agreement with previous works,\nalthough the much greater spatial resolution of the data allows for a very\ndetailed description. We confirm that the mass of the molecular region is 0.1\nM$_{\\odot}$. Additionally, we report a previously undetected component at the\nnebular equator, an inner, younger ring inclined $\\sim$60$^\\circ$ with respect\nto the main ring, showing a characteristic radius of 7.5$\\times$10$^{16}$ cm, a\nmass of 2.7$\\times$10$^{-3}$ M$_{\\odot}$, and a counterpart in optical images\nof the nebula. This inner ring has the same kinematical age as the northwest\noptical lobes, implying it was ejected approximately at the same time, hundreds\nof years after the ejection of the bulk of the molecular ring-like region. We\ndiscuss a sequence of events leading to the formation of the molecular and\noptical nebulae, and briefly speculate on the origin of this intriguing inner\nring.\n", "  The most compelling candidates for Dark Matter to day are WIMPs and axions.\nThe applicability of gasesous Time Projection Chambers (TPCs) with Micromesh\nGas Structures (Micromegas) to the search of these particles is explored within\nthis work. Both particles would produce an extremely low rate at very low\nenergies in particle detectors. Micromegas detectors can provide both low\nbackground rates and low en- ergy threshold, due to the high granularity,\nradiopurity and uniformity of the readout. Small (few cm wide) Micromegas\ndetectors are used to image the axion-induced x-ray signal expected in the CERN\nAxion Solar Telescope (CAST) experiment. We show the background levels obtained\nin CAST and the prospects to further reduce them to the values required by the\nInternation Axion Observatory (IAXO). We also present TREX-DM, a scaled-up\nversion of the Micromegas used in axion research, but this time dedicated to\nthe low-mass WIMP detection. TREX-DM is a high-pressure Micromegas-based TPC\ndesigned to host a few hundreds of grams of light nuclei (argon or neon) with\nenergy thresholds potentially at the level of 100 eV. The detector is described\nin detail, as well as the results of the commissioning and characterization\nphase on surface. Besides, the back- ground model of TREX-DM is presented,\nalong with the anticipated sensitivity of this search, which could go beyond\ncurrent experimental limits.\n", "  The study of balanced networks of excitatory and inhibitory neurons has led\nto several open questions. On the one hand it is yet unclear whether the\nasynchronous state observed in the brain is autonomously generated, or if it\nresults from the interplay between external drivings and internal dynamics. It\nis also not known, which kind of network variabilities will lead to irregular\nspiking and which to synchronous firing states. Here we show how isolated\nnetworks of purely excitatory neurons generically show asynchronous firing\nwhenever a minimal level of structural variability is present together with a\nrefractory period. Our autonomous networks are composed of excitable units, in\nthe form of leaky integrators spiking only in response to driving inputs. For a\nnon-uniform network, composed exclusively of excitatory neurons, we find a rich\nrepertoire of self-induced dynamical states, including asynchronous drifting\nstates, fully synchronized, or mixed, containing both drifting and synchronized\ncomponents. The individual neurons considered are excitable and hence do not\ndispose of intrinsic natural firing frequencies. An effective network-wide\ndistribution of natural frequencies is however generated autonomously through\nself-consistent feedback loops. We find two types of asynchronous activity,\nwith the individual neurons spiking regularly in the pure drifting state,\nalbeit with a continuous distribution of firing frequencies. The activity of\nthe drifting component, however, becomes irregular in the mixed state, due to\nthe periodic driving of the synchronized component. We propose a new tool for\nthe study of chaos in spiking neural networks, which consists of an analysis of\nthe time series of pairs of consecutive interspike intervals. In this space, we\nshow that a strange attractor with a fractal dimension is formed.\n", "  Prospective power supply systems based on Renewable Energy Sources require\nmeasures to balance power generation and load at all times. The utilisation of\nstorage devices and backup power plants is widely suggested for this purpose,\nwhereas the best combination is still to be found. In this work, we present a\nmodelling approach to systematically study scenarios of future power supply\nsystems with a high share of electricity originating from wind and solar\nresources. By considering backup as a subordinate source of electricity with\nenergy-only costs, the approach is independent of the actual full-load hours of\nthe backup power plants. Applying the approach to multi-year meteorological\ndata for Germany, cost-optimised combinations of storage devices and backup\npower are identified. We find that even in scenarios with significant excess\ngeneration capacities there is a need for storage devices or backup power\nplants with discharging power on the same order as the average load to balance\nthe system at all times. Furthermore, these capacities seem to be required in\nsome years of the multi-year period only. Our results imply that the societal\nneed of having electricity available at all times can likely be satisfied by\ninstalling over-capacities only, whereas a balance has to be found between\ninstalling additional backup or storage or generation capacities.\n", "  The spin-orbit interaction couples the electrons' motion to their spin.\nAccordingly, passing a current in a material with strong spin-orbit coupling\ngenerates a transverse spin current (spin Hall effect, SHE) and vice-versa\n(inverse spin Hall effect, ISHE). The emergence of SHE and ISHE as\ncharge-to-spin interconversion mechanisms offers a variety of novel spintronics\nfunctionalities and devices, some of which do not require any ferromagnetic\nmaterial. However, the interconversion efficiency of SHE and ISHE (spin Hall\nangle) is a bulk property that rarely exceeds ten percent, and does not take\nadvantage of interfacial and low-dimensional effects otherwise ubiquitous in\nspintronics hetero- and mesostructures. Here, we make use of an\ninterface-driven spin-orbit coupling mechanism - the Rashba effect - in the\noxide two-dimensional electron system (2DES) LaAlO3/SrTiO3 to achieve\nspin-to-charge conversion with unprecedented efficiency. Through spin-pumping,\nwe inject a spin current from a NiFe film into the oxide 2DES and detect the\nresulting charge current, which can be strongly modulated by a gate voltage. We\ndiscuss the amplitude of the effect and its gate dependence on the basis of the\nelectronic structure of the 2DES.\n", "  Probable projectile-target combinations for the synthesis of superheavy\nelement $^{302}$120 have been studied taking Coulomb and proximity potential as\nthe interaction barrier. The probabilities of compound nucleus formation, PCN\nfor the projectile-target combinations found in the cold reaction valley of\n$^{302}$120 are estimated. At energies near and above the Coulomb barrier, we\nhave calculated the capture, fusion and evaporation residue cross sections for\nthe reactions of all the probable projectile-target combinations so as to\npredict the most promising projectile-target combinations for the synthesis of\nSHE $^{302}$120 in heavy ion fusion reactions. The calculated fusion and\nevaporation cross section for the more asymmetric (hotter) projectile-target\ncombination is found to be higher than the less asymmetric (colder)\ncombination. It can be seen from the nature of quasi-fission barrier height,\nmass asymmetry, probability of compound nucleus formation, survival probability\nand excitation energy, the systems $^{44}$Ar + $^{258}$No, $^{46}$Ar +\n$^{256}$No, $^{48}$Ca + $^{254}$Fm, $^{50}$Ca + $^{252}$Fm, $^{54}$Ti +\n$^{248}$Cf, $^{58}$Cr + $^{244}$Cm in the deep region I of cold reaction\nvalley, and the systems $^{62}$Fe + $^{240}$Pu, $^{64}$Fe + $^{238}$Pu,\n$^{68}$Ni + $^{234}$U, $^{70}$Ni + $^{232}$U, $^{72}$Ni + $^{230}$U, $^{74}$Zn\n+ $^{228}$Th in the other cold valleys are identified as the better\nprojectile-target combinations for the synthesis of $^{302}$120. Our prediction\non the synthesis of $^{302}$120 superheavy nuclei using the combinations\n$^{54}$Cr+$^{248}$Cm, $^{58}$Fe+$^{244}$Pu, $^{64}$Ni+$^{238}$U and\n$^{50}$Ti+$^{249}$Cf are compared with available experimental data and other\ntheoretical predictions.\n", "  This paper starts by describing the dynamics of the electron-monopole system\nat both classical and quantum level by a suitable reduction procedure. This\nsuggests, in order to realise the space of states for quantum systems which are\nclassically described on topologically non trivial configuration spaces, to\nconsider Hilbert spaces of exterior differential forms. Among the advantages of\nthis formulation, we present in the case of the group ${\\rm SU}(2)$, how it is\npossible to obtain all unitary irreducible representations on such a Hilbert\nspace, and how it is possible to write scalar Dirac type operators, following\nan idea by K\\\"ahler.\n", "  In 2015, the LHCb collaboration endorsed the proposal to pursue an ambitious\nheavy-ion physics program. In 2013, LHCb has demonstrated its capabilities to\noperate successfully in p-Pb and Pb-p collisions, leading already to several\nimportant publications in the field. The measurements of the nuclear\nmodification factor and forward-backward production of prompt and displaced\nJ/$\\psi$, $\\psi$(2S) and $\\Upsilon$(1S) states, as well as the production of\nprompt $D^{0}$ mesons, have allowed to extend the knowledge of Cold Nuclear\nMatter effects on open heavy flavours and quarkonium production. The\nmeasurement of Z-boson production, important to constrain nuclear PDFs, and the\nmeasurement of two-particle angular correlations, probing collective effects in\nthe dense environment of high energy collisions, have also been performed.\nFurthermore, LHCb is the only experiment at the LHC that can be operated in\nfixed-target mode, owing to the injection of a small amount of gas inside the\nLHCb collision area. There have been several p-gas and Pb-gas data taking\nperiods during Run 1 and beginning of Run 2. This fixed target programme is\nconducted at a center-of-mass energy of $\\mathcal{O}$(100 GeV), and has great\npotential to bridge the gap of knowledge between SPS and RHIC in the domain of\nQuark Gluon Plasma physics. Finally, LHCb successfully participated to its\nfirst Pb-Pb data taking at the end of 2015. First studies show that up to\nsemi-central Pb-Pb collisions can be successfully analysed to provide unique\nmeasurements in the forward region. In this proceeding, we will present a\nselection of LHCb results in pA collisions. We will also give some prospects\nfor fixed target and Pb-Pb studies.\n", "  We perform extensive molecular dynamics simulations of a highly charged\nflexible polyelectrolyte (PE) chain in a poor solvent for the case when the\nchain is in a collapsed state and the electrostatic interactions, characterized\nby the reduced Bjerrum length $\\ell_B$, are strong. We detect the existence of\nseveral sub-regimes, $R_g \\sim \\ell_B^{-\\gamma}$, in the dependence of the\ngyration radius of the chain $R_g$ on $\\ell_B$. In contrast to a good solvent,\nthe exponent $\\gamma$ for a poor solvent crucially depends on the size and\nvalency of counterions. To explain the different sub-regimes we generalize the\nexisting counterion fluctuation theory by a more complete account of the volume\ninteractions in the free energy of the chain. These include interactions\nbetween the chain monomers, between monomers and counterions and the\ncounterions themselves. We also demonstrate that the presence of the condensed\ncounterions can modify the effective attraction among the chain monomers and\nimpact the sign of the second virial coefficient.\n", "  Spinor fields on 5-dimensional Lorentzian manifolds are classified, according\nto the geometric Fierz identities that involve their bilinear covariants. Based\nupon this classification that generalises the celebrated 4-dimensional Lounesto\nclassification of spinor fields, new non-trivial classes of 5-dimensional\nspinor fields are, hence, found, with important potential applications\nregarding bulk fermions and their subsequent localisation on brane-worlds. In\naddition, quaternionic bilinear covariants are used to derive the quaternionic\nspin density, through the truncated exterior bundle. In order to accomplish a\nrealisation of these new spinors, a Killing vector field is constructed on the\nhorizon of 5-dimensional Kerr black holes. This Killing vector field is shown\nto reach the time-like Killing vector field at the spatial infinity, through a\ncurrent 1-form density, constructed with the derived new spinor fields. The\ncurrent density is, moreover, expressed as the f\\\"unfbein components, assuming\na condensed form.\n", "  We emphasize that a knowledge of energy and entropy densities of quark gluon\nplasma - a thermalized de-confined matter, formed in relativistic heavy ion\ncollisions fixes the formation temperature and the product of gluon fugacity\nand formation time uniquely, {\\em provided} we know the relative fugacities of\nquarks and gluons. This also provides that a smaller formation time would imply\nlarger fugacities for partons. Next we explore the limits of chemical\nequilibration of partons during the initial stages in relativistic collision of\nheavy nuclei. The experimentally measured rapidity densities of transverse\nenergy and charged particle multiplicity at RHIC and LHC energies are used to\nestimate the energy and number densities with the assumption of formation of a\nthermally equilibrated quark gluon plasma which may be chemically equilibrated\nto the same or differing extents for quarks and gluons. The estimates are found\nto be very sensitive to the correction factor used for the Bj\\\"{o}rken energy\ndensity for identifying it with the initial energy density. The extent of\nchemical equilibration near the end of the QGP phase is inferred by solving\nmaster equations by including the processes $gg \\leftrightarrow ggg$ and $gg\n\\leftrightarrow q\\overline{q}$ along with expansion and cooling of the plasma.\nThe possible consequences for invariant mass distribution of intermediate mass\ndileptons radiated from the plasma are discussed which could distinguish\nbetween different scenarios.\n", "  Mechanical resonators based on low-dimensional materials are promising for\nforce and mass sensing experiments. The force sensitivity in these ultra-light\nresonators is often limited by the imprecision in the measurement of the\nvibrations, the fluctuations of the mechanical resonant frequency, and the\nheating induced by the measurement. Here, we strongly couple multilayer\ngraphene resonators to superconducting cavities in order to achieve a\ndisplacement sensitivity of $1.3$ fm Hz$^{-1/2}$. This coupling also allows us\nto damp the resonator to an average phonon occupation of $7.2$. Our best force\nsensitivity, $390$ zN Hz$^{-1/2}$ with a bandwidth of $200$ Hz, is achieved by\nbalancing measurement imprecision, optomechanical damping, and heating. Our\nresults hold promise for studying the quantum capacitance of graphene, its\nmagnetization, and the electron and nuclear spins of molecules adsorbed on its\nsurface.\n", "  We consider the problem of maximizing the spread of influence in a social\nnetwork by choosing a fixed number of initial seeds --- a central problem in\nthe study of network cascades. The majority of existing work on this problem,\nformally referred to as the influence maximization problem, is designed for\nsubmodular cascades. Despite the empirical evidence that many cascades are\nnon-submodular, little work has been done focusing on non-submodular influence\nmaximization.\n  We propose a new heuristic for solving the influence maximization problem and\nshow via simulations on real-world and synthetic networks that our algorithm\noutputs more influential seed sets than the state-of-the-art greedy algorithm\nin many natural cases, with average improvements of 7% for submodular cascades,\nand 55% for non-submodular cascades. Our heuristic uses a dynamic programming\napproach on a hierarchical decomposition of the social network to leverage the\nrelation between the spread of cascades and the community structure of social\nnetworks. We verify the importance of network structure by showing the quality\nof the hierarchical decomposition impacts the quality of seed set output by our\nalgorithm. We also present \"worst-case\" theoretical results proving that in\ncertain settings our algorithm outputs seed sets that are a factor of\n$\\Theta(\\sqrt{n})$ more influential than those of the greedy algorithm, where\n$n$ is the number of nodes in the network. Finally, we generalize our algorithm\nto a message passing version that can be used to find seed sets that have at\nleast as much influence as the dynamic programming algorithms.\n", "  Hollow carbon spheres (HCS) covered with metal oxide nanoparticles (SnO2 and\nMnO2, respectively) were successfully synthesized and investigated regarding\ntheir potential as anode materials for lithium-ion batteries. Raman\nspectroscopy shows a high degree of graphitization for the HCS host structure.\nThe mesoporous nature of the nanocomposites is confirmed by\nBrunauer-Emmett-Teller analysis. For both metal oxides under study, the metal\noxide functionalization of HCS yields a significant increase of electrochemical\nperformance. The charge capacity of HCS/SnO2 is 370 mAh/g after 45 cycles (266\nmAh/g in HCS/MnO2) which clearly exceeds the value of 188 mAh/g in pristine\nHCS. Remarkably, the data imply excellent long term cycling stability after 100\ncycles in both cases. The results hence show that mesoporous HCS/metal oxide\nnanocomposites enable exploiting the potential of metal oxide anode materials\nin Lithium-ion batteries by providing a HCS host structure which is both\nconductive and stable enough to accommodate big volume change effects.\n", "  After the seminal work of R. Landauer in 1957 relating the electrical\nresistance of a conductor to its scattering properties, much progress has been\nmade in our ability to predict the performance of electron devices in the DC\n(stationary) regime. Computational tools to describe their dynamical behavior\n(including the AC, transient and noise performance), however, are far from\nbeing as trustworthy as would be desired by the electronic industry. While\nthere is no fundamental limitation to correctly modeling the high-frequency\nquantum transport and its fluctuations, certainly more careful attention must\nbe paid to delicate issues such as overall charge neutrality, total current\nconservation, or the back action of the measuring apparatus. In this review, we\nwill show how the core ideas behind the Bohmian formulation of quantum\nmechanics can be exploited to design an efficient Monte Carlo algorithm that\nprovides a quantitative description of electron transport in open quantum\nsystems. By making the most of trajectory-based and wave function methods, the\nBITLLES simulator, a free software developed by the authors, extends the\ncapabilities that the semi-classical Monte Carlo simulation technique has\noffered for decades (DC, AC, noise, transients) to the quantum regime.\n", "  From the viewpoint of holography, the phase structure of a 5-dimensional\nReissner-Nordstr\\\"{o}m-AdS black hole is probed by the two point correlation\nfunction, Wilson loop, and entanglement entropy. As the case of thermal\nentropy, we find for all the probes, the black hole undergos a Hawking-Page\nphase transition, a first order phase transition and a second order phase\ntransition successively before it reaches to a stable phase. In addition, for\nthese probes, we find the equal area law for the first order phase transition\nis valid always and the critical exponent of the heat capacity for the second\norder phase transition coincides with that of the mean field theory regardless\nof the size of the boundary region.\n", "  Structural, resistivity, thermoelectric power and magneto-transport\nproperties of Cu doped Bi2Te3 topological insulators have been investigated.\nThe occurrence of the tuning of charge carriers from n type to p type by Cu\ndoping at Te sites of Bi2Te3 is observed both from Hall effect and\nthermoelectric power measurements. Carrier mobility decreases with the doping\nof Cu which provides evidence of the movement of Fermi level from bulk\nconduction band to the bulk valence band. Thermoelectric power also\nincreaseswith doping of Cu.Moreover linear magnetoresistance (LMR) has been\nobserved at high magnetic field in pure Bi2Te3 which is associated to the\ngapless topological surface states protected by time reversal symmetry (TRS),\nwhereas doping of Cu breaks TRS and an opening of band gap occurs which\nquenches the LMR.\n", "  Physical interactions between proteins are often difficult to decipher. The\naim of this paper is to present an algorithm designed to recognize binding\npatches and supporting structural scaffolds of interacting heterodimer protein\nchains using the Gaussian Network Model (GNM). The recognition is based on the\n(self)adjustable identification of kinetically hot residues, i.e., residues\nwith highest contributions to the weighted sum of fastest modes per chain\nextracted via GNM, and their connection to possible binding scaffolds. The\nalgorithm adjusts the number of modes used in the GNM's weighted sum\ncalculation using the ratio of predicted and expected numbers of target\nresidues (contact and first layer residues). This approach produces very good\nresults when applied to chains forming heterodimers, especially with dimers\nwith high chain length ratios. The protocol's ability to recognize near native\ndecoys was compared to the ability of the statistical potential of Lu and\nSkolnick using the Sternberg and Vakser decoy dimers sets. The statistical\npotential produced better overall results, but in a number of cases its\npredicting ability was comparable, or even worse than the ability of the\nadjustable GNM approach. The results presented in this paper suggest that in\nheterodimers, at least one partnering chain has interacting scaffold determined\nby the immovable kinetically hot residues. In many cases interacting chains\n(especially if being of noticeably different sizes), either behave as rigid\nlock and key, or exhibit opposite dynamic behaviors. While the binding surface\nof one of the chains is rigid and stable, its partner's interacting scaffold is\nmore flexible and adaptable.\n  Authors note: The approach described here was initially given as a rough\ndraft in 2013 [1]. The next manuscript will describe the behavior of protein\ndimers incorrectly characterized with the present approach.\n", "  The move to high performance applications greatly increases the demand to\nproduce large instantaneous fluid forces for high-speed maneuvering and\nimproved power efficiency for sustained propulsion. Animals achieve remarkable\nfeats of maneuvering and efficiency by changing their body shape to generate\nunsteady fluid forces. Inspired by this, we have studied a range of immersed\nbodies which drastically change their shape to produce fluid forces. These\ninclude relatively simple shape- changes, such as quickly changing the angle of\nattack of a foil to induce emergency stops and the use of tandem flapping foils\nto generate three times the average propulsive force of a single flapping foil.\nThey also include more unconventional shape-changes such as high-speed\nretracting foil sections to power roll and dive maneuvers and the use of soft\nrobotics to rapidly shrink the frontal area of an ellipsoid to power 68%\nefficient fast-start maneuvers or even completely cancel the drag force with\n91% quasi-propulsive efficiency. These systems have been investigated with\nanalytics, experimental measurements and immersed-boundary numerical\nsimulations.\n", "  In this work, we perform a statistical study on Dirac Billiards in the\nextreme quantum limit (a single open channel on the leads). Our numerical\nanalysis uses a large ensemble of random matrices and demonstrates the\npreponderant role of dephasing mechanisms in such chaotic billiards. Physical\nimplementations of these billiards range from quantum dots of graphene to\ntopological insulators structures. We show, in particular, that the role of\nfinite crossover fields between the universal symmetries quickly leaves the\nconductance to the asymptotic limit of unitary ensembles. Furthermore, we show\nthat the dephasing mechanisms strikingly lead Dirac billiards from the extreme\nquantum regime to the semiclassical Gaussian regime.\n", "  The concept of photon is not necessary only applied to the relativistic\nDoppler theory. It may also work well for classical theory. As conservation of\nmomentum and energy are physical laws, if applying these laws gives the exact\nrelativistic Doppler effect, it should also give the exact classical Doppler\neffect. So far the classical Doppler effect is only obtained by using some\napproximation, as derived by Fermi in 1932. We show that the exact classical\nDoppler effect can be derived from the photon emission process in the exact\ntreatment and reveal that these results are the same as those derived from the\nwave theory of light.\n", "  I give a scientific perspective, with a personal emphasis, on the seminal\n1992 paper, \"The quantum-state diffusion model applied to open systems\", by\nGisin and Percival.\n", "  We study time-dependant Hawking-like radiation as seen by an infalling\nobserver during gravitational collapse of a thin shell. We calculate the\noccupation number of particles whose frequencies are measured in the proper\ntime of an infalling observer in Eddington-Finkelstein coordinates. We solve\nthe equations for the whole process from the beginning of the collapse till the\nmoment when the collapsing shell reaches zero radius. The radiation\ndistribution is not thermal in the whole frequency regime, but it is\napproximately thermal for the wavelengths of the order of the Schwarzschild\nradius of the collapsing shell. After the Schwarzschild radius is crossed, the\ntemperature increases without limits as the singularity is approached. We also\ncalculate the density matrix associated with this radiation. It turns out that\nthe off-diagonal correlation terms to the diagonal Hawking's leading order\nterms are very important. While the trace of the diagonal (Hawking's) density\nmatrix squared decreases during the evolution, the trace of the total density\nmatrix squared remains unity at all times and all frequencies.\n", "  Extending results of Bahadoran and Bodineau we show that the flux rate of\nTASEP with independent and identically distributed disorder always has a\nplateau of densities around $\\frac12$.\n", "  We studied the electron transfer from excitons in adsorbed indoline dye\nlayers across the organic-inorganic interface. The hybrids consist of indoline\nderivatives on the one hand and different inorganic substrates (TiO$_2$, ZnO,\nSiO$_2$(0001), fused silica) on the other. We reveal the electron transfer\ntimes from excitons in dye layers to the organic-inorganic interface by\nanalyzing the photoluminescence transients of the dye layers after femtosecond\nexcitation and applying kinetic model calculations. A correlation between the\ntransfer times and four parameters have been found:(i) the number of anchoring\ngroups, (ii) the distance between the dye and the organic-inorganic interface,\nwhich was varied by the alkyl-chain lengths between the carboxylate anchoring\ngroup and the dye, (iii) the thickness of the adsorbed dye layer, and (iv) the\nlevel alignment between the excited dye ($\\pi$*-level) and the conduction band\nminimum of the inorganic semiconductor.\n", "  With an analytical solutions of DGLAP evolution equations based on the\nLaplace transform method , we find the fragmentation functions (FFs) of neutral\nmesons, $\\pi^0$ and $k ^0$ at NLO approximation. We also calculated the total\nfragmentation functions of these mesons and compared them with experimental\ndata and those from global fits. The results show a good agreements between our\nsolutions and other models and also are compatible with experimental data.\n", "  The only well-studied red nova progenitor (V1309 Sco) was a contact binary\nwith a 1.4-day period. The prospects for searching for similar systems, as well\nas stellar merger candidates in general, are explored in this work. The\nphotospheric temperatures of 128 variables with periods P = 1.1 - 1.8 d\nclassified as W UMa-type binaries are calculated using their colors listed in\nthe SDSS catalog. A selection of 15 contact binaries with similar temperatures\nand periods as the V1309 Sco progenitor is thus compiled. The Kepler Eclipsing\nBinary Catalog is used to analyse systems with eclipse timing variations (ETV)\npossibly caused by changes of the orbital period. Out of the 31 systems with\nparabolic ETV curves listed by Conroy et al. (2014, AJ, 147, 45) two could be\ncontact binaries with a decreasing period and, therefore, potential stellar\nmerger candidates. Out of the 569 contact binaries in the OGLE field analysed\nby Kubiak et al. (2006, AcA, 56, 253) 14 systems have periods longer than 0.8 d\nand a statistically significant period decrease.\n", "  Within the rigorous axiomatic framework for the description of quantum\nmechanical systems with a large number of degrees of freedom, we show that the\nnonequilibrium steady state, constructed in the quasifree fermionic system\ncorresponding to the isotropic XY chain in which a finite sample, coupled to\ntwo thermal reservoirs at different temperatures, is exposed to a local\nexternal magnetic field, is breaking translation invariance and exhibits a\nstrictly positive entropy production rate. Moreover, we prove that there exists\na second-order nonequilibrium quantum phase transition with respect to the\nstrength of the magnetic field as soon as the system is truly out of\nequilibrium.\n", "  Galileon models are among the most appealing candidates for Dark Energy. The\nreason is twofold: classically, they provide a tracking solution leading to an\nalmost DeSitter space starting from very generic initial conditions in the deep\nradiation era. The second reason is the standard lore that Galileons are\nquantum mechanically stable. The latter property is certainly true in flat\nspace-time, thanks to the non-renormalization theorems of galilean coupling\nconstants. However, in a cosmological background, we show that quantum effects\nmight dominate the classical trajectory. Assuming the radiation era to last at\nleast up to the electroweak phase transition, the trajectory with initial\nconditions sitting on the tracker is ruled out. On the other hand, it is always\npossible to find a sub-space of initial conditions such that the dark energy\nsolution approaches stably the tracker at late times. Fixing the value of\ninitial conditions that best fit current data, and assuming that the galileon\neffective theory is valid up to the beginning of the radiation epoch, we found\nthat the reheating temperature of the universe cannot be larger than $10^8 \\\n{\\rm GeV}$. Reversing the argument, if dark energy will turn out to be in form\nof Galileons, the bounds by EUCLID on the initial conditions for these models\nwill also be a bound on the reheating temperature of our Universe.\n", "  This work introduces and characterizes a fast parameterless filter based on\nthe Helgason-Ludwig consistency conditions, used to improve the accuracy of\nanalytical reconstructions of tomographic undersampled datasets. The filter,\nacting in the Radon domain, extrapolates intermediate projections between those\nexisting. The resulting sinogram, doubled in views, is then reconstructed by a\nstandard analytical method. Experiments with simulated data prove that the\npeak-signal-to-noise ratio of the results computed by filtered backprojection\nis improved up to 5-6 dB, if the filter is used prior to reconstruction.\n", "  We propose the creation and investigation of a system of spin-one fermions in\nthe presence of artificial spin-orbit coupling, via the interaction of three\nhyperfine states of fermionic atoms to Raman laser fields. We explore the\nemergence of spinor physics in the Hamiltonian described by the interaction\nbetween light and atoms, and analyze spectroscopic properties such as\ndispersion relation, Fermi surfaces, spectral functions, spin-dependent\nmomentum distributions and density of states. Connections to spin-one bosons\nand SU(3) systems is made, as well relations to the Lifshitz transition and\nPomeranchuk instability are presented.\n", "  We present a discussion of the design issues and trade-offs that have been\nconsidered in putting together a new concept for MOSAIC, the multi-object\nspectrograph for the E-ELT. MOSAIC aims to address the combined science cases\nfor E-ELT MOS that arose from the earlier studies of the multi-object and\nmulti-adaptive optics instruments. MOSAIC combines the advantages of a\nhighly-multiplexed instrument targeting single-point objects with one which has\na more modest multiplex but can spatially resolve a source with high resolution\n(IFU). These will span across two wavebands: visible and near-infrared.\n", "  We discuss the Iwasawa-decomposition of a general matrix in SL($n$,\n$\\mathbb{Q}_p$) and SL($n$, $\\mathbb{R}$). For SL($n$, $\\mathbb{Q}_p$) we\ndefine an algorithm for computing a complete Iwasawa-decomposition and give a\nformula parameterizing the full family of decompositions. Furthermore, we prove\nthat the $p$-adic norms of the coordinates on the Cartan torus are unique\nacross all decompositions and give a closed formula for them which is proven\nusing induction. For the case SL($n$, $\\mathbb{R}$), the decomposition is\nunique and we give formulae for the complete decomposition which are also\nproven inductively. Lastly we outline a method for deriving the norms of the\ncoordinates on the Cartan torus in the framework of representation theory. This\nyields a simple formula valid globally which expresses these norms in terms of\nthe vector norms of generalized Pl\\\"ucker coordinates.\n", "  Quasicrystals (QCs) are a novel form of matter, which are neither crystalline\nnor amorphous. Among many surprising properties of QCs is their high catalytic\nactivity. We propose a mechanism explaining this peculiarity based on unusual\ndynamics of atoms at special sites in QCs, namely, localized anharmonic\nvibrations (LAVs) and phasons. In the former case, one deals with a large\namplitude (~ fractions of an angstrom) time-periodic oscillations of a small\ngroup of atoms around their stable positions in the lattice, known also as\ndiscrete breathers, which can be excited in regular crystals as well as in QCs.\nOn the other hand, phasons are a specific property of QCs, which are\nrepresented by very large amplitude (~angstrom) oscillations of atoms be-tween\ntwo quasi-stable positions determined by the geometry of a QC. Large amplitude\natomic motion in LAVs and phasons results in time-periodic driving of adjacent\npotential wells occupied by hydrogen ions (protons or deuterons) in case of\nhydrogenated QCs. This driving may result in the increase of amplitude and\nenergy of zero-point vibrations (ZPV). Based on that, we demonstrate a drastic\nincrease of the D-D or D-H fusion rate with increasing number of modulation\nperiods evaluated in the framework of Schwinger model, which takes into account\nsuppression of the Coulomb barrier due to lattice vibrations. In this context,\nwe present numerical solution of Schrodinger equation for a particle in a\nnon-stationary double well potential, which is driven time-periodically\nimitating the action of a LAV or phason. We show that the rate of tunneling of\nthe particle through the potential barrier separating the wells is enhanced\ndrastically by the driving, and it increases strongly with increasing amplitude\nof the driving. These results support the concept of nuclear catalysis in QCs\nthat can take place at special sites provided by their inherent topology.\n", "  The task of programming a quantum computer is just as strange as quantum\nmechanics itself. But it now looks like a simple 3D puzzle may be the future\ntool of quantum software engineers.\n", "  An alternative methodology to evaluate two-electron-repulsion integrals based\non numerical approximation is proposed. Computational chemistry has branched\ninto two major fields with methodologies based on quantum mechanics and\nclassical force fields. However, there are significant shadowy areas not\ncovered by any of the available methods. Many relevant systems are often too\nbig for traditional quantum chemical methods while being chemically too complex\nfor classical force fields. Examples include systems in nanomedicine, studies\nof metalloproteins, etc. There is an urgent need to develop fast quantum\nchemical methods able to study large and complex systems. This work is a\nproof-of-concept on the numerical techniques required to develop accurate and\ncomputationally efficient algorithms for the fast calculation of\nelectron-repulsion integrals, one of the most significant bottlenecks in the\nextension of quantum chemistry to large systems. All concepts and calculations\nwere developed for the three-center integral (pxApxB|pxCpxC) with all atoms\nbeing carbon. Starting with the analytical formulae, convenient decompositions\nwere tested to provide smooth two-dimensional surfaces that were easily fitted.\nThe approximating algorithm consisted of a multilayered approach based on\nmultiple fittings of two-dimensional surfaces. An important aspect of the new\nmethod is its independence on the number of contracted Gaussian primitives. The\nbasis set of choice was STO-6G. In future developments, larger basis sets will\nbe developed. This work is part of a large effort aimed at improving the\ninadequacies of existing computational chemistry methods, both based on quantum\nmechanics and classical force fields, in particular in describing large and\nheterogeneous systems (ex. metalloproteins).\n", "  It has been shown that some aspects of the terrestrial planets can be\nexplained, particularly the Earth/Mars mass ratio, when they form from a\ntruncated disk with an outer edge near 1.0 au (Hansen 2009). This has been\npreviously modeled starting from an intermediate stage of growth utilizing\npre-formed planetary embryos. We present simulations that were designed to test\nthis idea by following the growth process from km-sized objects located between\n0.7 to 1.0 au up to terrestrial planets. The simulations explore initial\nconditions where the solids in the disk are planetesimals with radii initially\nbetween 3 and 300 km, alternately including effects from a dissipating gaseous\nsolar nebula and collisional fragmentation. We use a new Lagrangian code known\nas LIPAD (Levison et al. 2012), which is a particle-based code that models the\nfragmentation, accretion and dynamical evolution of a large number of\nplanetesimals, and can model the entire growth process from km-sizes up to\nplanets. A suite of large (Mars mass) planetary embryos is complete in only 1\nMyr, containing most of the system mass. A quiescent period then persists for\n10-20 Myr characterized by slow diffusion of the orbits and continued accretion\nof the remaining planetesimals. This is interupted by an instability that leads\nto embryos crossing orbits and embyro-embryo impacts that eventually produce\nthe final set of planets. While this evolution is different than that found in\nother works exploring an annulus, the final planetary systems are similar, with\nroughly the correct number of planets and good Mars-analogs.\n", "  The gravitational interaction of antimatter and matter has never been\ndirectly probed. ALPHA-g is a novel experiment that aims to perform the first\nmeasurement of the antihydrogen gravitational mass. A fundamental requirement\nfor this new apparatus is a position sensitive particle detector around the\nantihydrogen trap which provides information about antihydrogen annihilation\nlocation. The proposed detector is a radial Time Projection Chamber, or\n\\textit{rTPC}, whose concept is being developed at TRIUMF. A simulation of the\ndetector and the development of the reconstruction software, used to determine\nthe antihydrogen annihilation point, is presented alongside with the expected\nperformance of the rTPC.\n", "  We present the current results of the astrometric characterization of the VLT\nplanet finder SPHERE over 2 years of on-sky operations. We first describe the\ncriteria for the selection of the astrometric fields used for calibrating the\nscience data: binaries, multiple systems, and stellar clusters. The analysis\nincludes measurements of the pixel scale and the position angle with respect to\nthe North for both near-infrared subsystems, the camera IRDIS and the integral\nfield spectrometer IFS, as well as the distortion for the IRDIS camera. The\nIRDIS distortion is shown to be dominated by an anamorphism of 0.60+/-0.02%\nbetween the horizontal and vertical directions of the detector, i.e. 6 mas at\n1\". The anamorphism is produced by the cylindrical mirrors in the common path\nstructure hence common to all three SPHERE science subsystems (IRDIS, IFS, and\nZIMPOL), except for the relative orientation of their field of view. The\ncurrent estimates of the pixel scale and North angle for IRDIS are\n12.255+/-0.009 milliarcseconds/pixel for H2 coronagraphic images and\n-1.75+/-0.08 deg. Analyses of the IFS data indicate a pixel scale of\n7.46+/-0.02 milliarcseconds/pixel and a North angle of -102.18+/-0.13 deg. We\nfinally discuss plans for providing astrometric calibration to the SPHERE users\noutside the instrument consortium.\n", "  A pedagogical introduction to aspects of string cosmology, including the\nlandscape (BPBT) solution to the cosmological constant problem, brane-antibrane\ninflation, warped compactification, the KKLMMT model, the eta problem of SUGRA\nmodels, DBI inflation, Kahler modulus and racetrack inflation, the D3-D7 model,\ncosmic superstrings, and the problem of reheating.
