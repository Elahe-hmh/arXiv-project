The effect of the inaccessible magnetic flux is\ndistributed between the center-of-mass and the internal pair level, and the\nnontrivial manner in which the two levels are mutually affecting each other\ndemonstrates the interplay between interactions, nontrivial topology, the\nAharonov-Bohm flux and the characteristics of a charged quantal mixture.\nAnalytical expressions for energy spectra, wavefunctions, (flux-dependent)\ncritical interactions for binding and current densities are derived, and these\noffer the rare possibility to study persistent currents from the point of view\nof an interacting nanoscopic system. Two cyclic adiabatic processes are\nidentified, one coupled to the center-of-mass behavior and the other defined on\nthe two-body interaction potential, with the associated Berry's phases also\nanalytically determined; these are found to be directly linked to the electric\nand probability (persistent) currents in nontrivial ways that are shown to be\nuniversal (independent of the actual form of the interaction). The direct\nconnection of the two-body Berry's phase to the electric current for a neutral\nsystem is found to disappear in case of identical particles - hence revealing\nthe character of a charged mixture as being crucial for exhibiting these\nuniversal behaviors.\n", "  Spin dynamics of field-driven domain walls (DWs) guided by Permalloy\nnanowires are studied by high-speed magneto-optic polarimetry and numerical\nsimulations. DW velocities and spin configurations are determined as functions\nof longitudinal drive field, transverse bias field, and nanowire width.\nNanowires having cross-sectional dimensions large enough to support vortex wall\nstructures exhibit regions of drive-field strength (at zero bias field) that\nhave enhanced DW velocity resulting from coupled vortex structures that\nsuppress oscillatory motion. Factor of ten enhancements of the DW velocity are\nobserved above the critical longitudinal drive-field (that marks the onset of\noscillatory DW motion) when a transverse bias field is applied. Nanowires\nhaving smaller cross-sectional dimensions that support transverse wall\nstructures also exhibit a region of higher mobility above the critical field,\nand similar transverse-field induced velocity enhancement but with a smaller\nenhancement factor. The bias-field enhancement of DW velocity is explained by\nnumerical simulations of the spin distribution and dynamics within the\npropagating DW that reveal dynamic stabilization of coupled vortex structures\nand suppression of oscillatory motion in the nanowire conduit resulting in\nuniform DW motion at high speed.\n", "  We reformulate Classical Mechanics as a timeless relativistic theory. Readers\nare introduced to a new class of reference systems, the binate frames, where\nphysical events are identified with four position-coordinates -- no clocks are\nused. The binate frames are inertial and adaptable to relative motions.\nAnalyses that use binate frames are valid at all energy levels. When desirable\nto do so, the results are easily expressed as in special relativity, in terms\nof space and time coordinates of inertial observers. Given the importance of\nmass-and-spring systems to theoretical physics, we analyzed such a system.\nPublished special relativistic solutions predict anharmonic oscillations, but\nin the inertial frame where the mass-and-spring system (as a whole) is at rest,\nour solution is harmonic with energy-dependent angular frequency.\n", "  Methods to map artificial night sky brightness and stellar visibility across\nlarge territories or their distribution over the entire sky at any site are\nbased on the computation of the propagation of light pollution with Garstang\nmodels, a simplified solution of the radiative transfer problem in the\natmosphere which allows a fast computation by reducing it to a ray-tracing\napproach. We present here up-to-date Extended Garstang Models (EGM) which\nprovide a more general numerical solution for the radiative transfer problem\napplied to the propagation of light pollution in the atmosphere. We also\npresent the LPTRAN software package, an application of EGM to high-resolution\nDMSP-OLS satellite measurements of artificial light emissions and to GTOPO30\ndigital elevation data, which provides an up-to-date method to predict the\nartificial brightness distribution of the night sky at any site in the World at\nany visible wavelength for a broad range of atmospheric situations and the\nartificial radiation density in the atmosphere across the territory. EGM\naccount for (i) multiple scattering, (ii) wavelength from 250 nm to infrared,\n(iii) Earth curvature and its screening effects, (iv) sites and sources\nelevation, (v) many kinds of atmosphere with the possibility of custom setup\n(e.g. including thermal inversion layers), (vi) mix of different boundary layer\naerosols and tropospheric aerosols, with the possibility of custom setup, (vii)\nup to 5 aerosol layers in upper atmosphere including fresh and aged volcanic\ndust and meteoric dust, (viii) variations of the scattering phase function with\nelevation, (ix) continuum and line gas absorption from many species, ozone\nincluded, (x) up to 5 cloud layers, (xi) wavelength dependant bidirectional\nreflectance of the ground surface from NASA/MODIS satellites, main models or\ncustom data (snow included), (xii) geographically variable upward light\nemission function.\n", "  We construct a stochastic process, called the Liouville Brownian motion,\nwhich is the Brownian motion associated to the metric $e^{\\gamma X(z)}\\,dz^2$,\n$\\gamma<\\gamma_c=2$ and $X$ is a Gaussian Free Field. Such a process is\nconjectured to be related to the scaling limit of random walks on large planar\nmaps eventually weighted by a model of statistical physics which are embedded\nin the Euclidean plane or in the sphere in a conformal manner. The construction\namounts to changing the speed of a standard two-dimensional Brownian motion\n$B_t$ depending on the local behavior of the Liouville measure\n\"$M_{\\gamma}(dz)=e^{\\gamma X(z)}\\,dz$\". We prove that the associated Markov\nprocess is a Feller diffusion for all $\\gamma<\\gamma_c=2$ and that for all\n$\\gamma<\\gamma_c$, the Liouville measure $M_{\\gamma}$ is invariant under\n$P_{\\mathbf{t}}$. This Liouville Brownian motion enables us to introduce a\nwhole set of tools of stochastic analysis in Liouville quantum gravity, which\nwill be hopefully useful in analyzing the geometry of Liouville quantum\ngravity.\n", "  The goal of this paper is to establish a relation between characteristic\npolynomials of $N\\times N$ GUE random matrices $\\mathcal{H}$ as $N\\to\\infty$,\nand Gaussian processes with logarithmic correlations. We introduce a\nregularized version of fractional Brownian motion with zero Hurst index, which\nis a Gaussian process with stationary increments and logarithmic increment\nstructure. Then we prove that this process appears as a limit of\n$D_N(z)=-\\log|\\det(\\mathcal{H}-zI)|$ on mesoscopic scales as $N\\to\\infty$. By\nemploying a Fourier integral representation, we use this to prove a continuous\nanalogue of a result by Diaconis and Shahshahani [J. Appl. Probab. 31A (1994)\n49-62]. On the macroscopic scale, $D_N(x)$ gives rise to yet another type of\nGaussian process with logarithmic correlations. We give an explicit\nconstruction of the latter in terms of a Chebyshev-Fourier random series.\n", "  We study the spectral properties of the Sturm Hamiltolian of eventually\nconstant type, which includes the Fibonacci Hamiltonian. Let $s$ be the\nHausdorff dimension of the spectrum. For $V>20$, we show that the restriction\nof the $s$-dimensional Hausdorff measure to the spectrum is a Gibbs type\nmeasure; the density of states measure is a Markov measure. Based on the fine\nstructures of these measures, we show that both measures are exact dimensional;\nwe obtain exact asymptotic behaviors for the optimal H\\\"older exponent and the\nHausdorff dimension of the density of states measure and for the Hausdorff\ndimension of the spectrum. As a consequence, if the frequency is not silver\nnumber type, then for $V$ big enough, we establish strict inequalities between\nthese three spectral characteristics.\n  We achieve them by introducing an auxiliary symbolic dynamical system and\napplying the thermodynamical and multifractal formalisms of almost additive\npotentials.\n", "  The adsorption structure of the molecular switch azobenzene on Ag(111) is\ninvestigated by a combination of normal incidence x-ray standing waves and\ndispersion-corrected density functional theory. The inclusion of non-local\ncollective substrate response (screening) in the dispersion correction improves\nthe description of dense monolayers of azobenzene, which exhibit a substantial\ntorsion of the molecule. Nevertheless, for a quantitative agreement with\nexperiment explicit consideration of the effect of vibrational mode\nanharmonicity on the adsorption geometry is crucial.\n", "  The templated growth of the basic porphyrin unit, free-base porphine (2H-P),\nis characterized by means of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and\nnear-edge X-ray absorption fine-structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy measurements\nand density functional theory (DFT). The DFT simulations allow the\ndeconvolution of the complex XPS and NEXAFS signatures into contributions\noriginating from five inequivalent carbon atoms, which can be grouped into C-N\nand C-C bonded species. Polarization-dependent NEXAFS measurements reveal an\nintriguing organizational behavior: On both Cu(111) and Ag(111), for coverages\nup to one monolayer, the molecules adsorb undeformed and parallel to the\nrespective metal surface. Upon increasing the coverage, however, the\norientation of the molecules in the thin films depends on the growth\nconditions. Multilayers deposited at low temperatures (LT) exhibit a similar\naverage tilting angle (30 degree relative to the surface plane) on both\nsubstrates. Conversely, for multilayers grown at room temperature a markedly\ndifferent scenario exists. On Cu(111) the film thickness is self-limited to a\ncoverage of approximately two layers, while on Ag(111) multilayers can be grown\neasily and, in contrast to the bulk 2H-P crystal, the molecules are oriented\nperpendicular to the surface. This difference in molecular orientation results\nin a modified line-shape of the C 1s XPS signatures that is dependent on the\nincident photon energy, which is explained by comparison with depth-resolved\nDFT calculations. Simulations of ionization energies for differently stacked\nmolecules show no indication for a packing-induced modification of the\nmultilayer XP spectra, thus indicating that the comparison of single molecule\ncalculations to multilayer data is justified.\n", "  Working with a toy model whose partition function consists of a discrete\nsummation, we introduce the statistical field-theory methodology by\ntransforming a partition function via a formal Gaussian integral relation (the\nHubbard-Stratonovich transformation). We then consider Gaussian type of\napproximations, wherein correlational contributions enter as harmonic\nfluctuations around the saddle-point solution. The work focuses on how to\nconstruct a self-consistent, non-perturbative approximation without recourse to\na variational construction based on the Gibbs-Bogolyubov-Feynman inequality\nthat is inapplicable to a complex action. To address this problem, we propose a\nconstruction based on a selective satisfaction of a set of exact relations\ngenerated by considering a dual representation of a partition function, in its\noriginal and transformed form.\n", "  This review explores the number of mean-field constructions for ions whose\nstructure goes beyond the point-charge description, a representation used in\nthe standard Poisson-Boltzmann equation. The exploration is motivated by a body\nof experimental work which indicates that ion-specific effects play a\nsignificant role, where ions of the same valence charge but different size,\npolarizability, or shape yield quite different, and sometimes surprising\nresults. Furthermore, there are many large ions encountered in soft-matter and\nbiophysics that do not fit into a point-charge description, and their extension\nin space and shape must be taken into account of any reasonable representation.\n", "  Supersymmetries in quantum mechanics offer a way to obtain degeneracies in\nthe excitation spectrum which do not originate from selection rules. The\nmechanism behind the degeneracies is the same as the one that leads to the\nmiraculous cancellations of divergences in supersymmetric field theories found\nin the high energy physics context. Even though of importance, there is up to\nnow no realistic proposal of non-integrable systems that show level\ndegeneracies due to a supersymmetric structure. Here, we propose an\nimplementation of a quantum-mechanical supersymmetry in a Cooper-pair box\nshunted by a Josephson junction rhombus which is effectively $\\pi$-periodic in\nthe superconducting phase difference. For a characteristic ratio between the\nstrength of the $2\\pi$- and the $\\pi$-periodic junction, we find a two-fold\ndegeneracy of all the energy levels all the way from the weak junction/charge\nqubit limit to the strong junction/transmon regime. We provide explicit values\nfor the parameters of the rhombus and show that tuning in and out of the\nsupersymmetric point is easily achieved by varying an external gate voltage. We\nfurthermore discuss a microwave experiment to detect the supersymmetry and\nconclude that it could indeed be simulated with currently existing Josephson\njunction technology.\n", "  A detailed consideration is given to the translation-invariant theory of\nTulub polaron constructed without the use of Pekar ansatz. A fundamental result\nof the theory is that the value of the polaron energy is lower than that\nobtained on the basis of Pekar ansatz which was considered as an asymptotically\nexact solution in the strong coupling limit. In the case of bipolarons the\ntheory yields the best values of the coupling energy and critical parameters of\ntheir stability. Numerous physical consequences of the existence of\ntranslation-invariant polarons and bipolarons are discussed.\n", "  We examine statistical pictures of violent conflicts over the last 2000\nyears, finding techniques for dealing with incompleteness and unreliability of\nhistorical data. We introduce a novel approach to apply extreme value theory to\nfat-tailed variables that have a remote, but nonetheless finite upper bound, by\ndefining a corresponding unbounded dual distribution (given that potential war\ncasualties are bounded by the world population). We apply methods from extreme\nvalue theory on the dual distribution and derive its tail properties. The dual\nmethod allows us to calculate the real mean of war casualties, which proves to\nbe considerably larger than the sample mean, meaning severe underestimation of\nthe tail risks of conflicts from naive observation. We analyze the robustness\nof our results to errors in historical reports, taking into account the\nunreliability of accounts by historians and absence of critical data. We study\ninter-arrival times between tail events and find that no particular trend can\nbe asserted. All the statistical pictures obtained are at variance with the\nprevailing claims about \"long peace\", namely that violence has been declining\nover time.\n", "  A correct description of electronic exchange and correlation effects for\nmolecules in contact with extended (metal) surfaces is a challenging task for\nfirst-principles modeling. In this work we demonstrate the importance of\ncollective van der Waals dispersion effects beyond the pairwise approximation\nfor organic--inorganic systems on the example of atoms, molecules, and\nnanostructures adsorbed on metals. We use the recently developed many-body\ndispersion (MBD) approach in the context of density-functional theory [Phys.\nRev. Lett. 108, 236402 (2012); J. Chem. Phys. 140, 18A508 (2014)] and assess\nits ability to correctly describe the binding of adsorbates on metal surfaces.\nWe briefly review the MBD method and highlight its similarities to\nquantum-chemical approaches to electron correlation in a quasiparticle picture.\nIn particular, we study the binding properties of xenon,\n3,4,9,10-perylene-tetracarboxylic acid (PTCDA), and a graphene sheet adsorbed\non the Ag(111) surface. Accounting for MBD effects we are able to describe\nchanges in the anisotropic polarizability tensor, improve the description of\nadsorbate vibrations, and correctly capture the adsorbate--surface interaction\nscreening. Comparison to other methods and experiment reveals that inclusion of\nMBD effects improves adsorption energies and geometries, by reducing the\noverbinding typically found in pairwise additive dispersion-correction\napproaches.\n", "  This paper studies the quantum modifications of the\nReissner-Nordstr\\\"{o}m-(A)dS black hole within Quantum Einstein Gravity,\ncoupled to an electromagnetic sector. Quantum effects are introduced on the\nlevel of the improvements of the classical solution, where the originally\nconstant couplings ($G_0$, $\\Lambda_0$, and $\\alpha_0$) are promoted to scale\ndependent quantities ($G_k$, $\\Lambda_k$, and $\\alpha_k$). Those running\ncouplings are calculated in the functional renormalization group approach. A\ncrucial point of this, so called \"improving solutions\" procedure is the scale\nsetting where the arbitrary scale $k$ acquires physical meaning due to a\nrelation to the coordinate scale $r$. It is proposed to use such scale settings\nwhich are stable after iterative improvements. Using this method one finds that\nfor those improved solutions, there is no stable remnant and due to the\nappearance of a new internal horizon, there is also no necessity to impose a\nminimal black hole mass for charged black holes, in order to avoid the the\ncosmic censorship hypothesis.\n", "  Palomar 5 (Pal 5) is a faint halo globular cluster associated with narrow\ntidal tails. It is a useful system to understand the process of tidal\ndissolution, as well as to constrain the potential of the Milky Way. A\nwell-determined orbit for Pal 5 would enable detailed study of these open\nquestions. We present here the first CCD-based proper motion measurement of Pal\n5 obtained using SDSS as a first epoch and new LBT/LBC images as a second,\ngiving a baseline of 15 years. We perform relative astrometry, using SDSS as a\ndistortion-free reference, and images of the cluster and also of the Pal 5\nstream for the derivation of the distortion correction for LBC. The reference\nframe is made up of background galaxies. We correct for differential chromatic\nrefraction using relations obtained from SDSS colors as well as from\nflux-calibrated spectra, finding that the correction relations for stars and\nfor galaxies are different. We obtain mu_alpha=-2.296+/-0.186 mas/yr and\nmu_delta=-2.257+/-0.181 mas/yr for the proper motion of Pal 5. We use this\nmotion, and the publicly available code galpy, to model the disruption of Pal 5\nin different Milky Way models consisting of a bulge, a disk and a spherical\ndark matter halo. Our fits to the observed stream properties (streak and radial\nvelocity gradient) result in a preference for a relatively large Pal 5 distance\nof around 24 kpc. A slightly larger absolute proper motion than what we measure\nalso results in better matches but the best solutions need a change in\ndistance. We find that a spherical Milky Way model, with V_0=220 km/s and V_(20\nkpc), i.e., approximately at the apocenter of Pal 5, of 218 km/s, can match the\ndata well, at least for our choice of disk and bulge parametrization.\n", "  We present an exact numerical study of the scaling of density and momentum\ndistribution functions of harmonically trapped one-dimensional bosons with\nrepulsive contact interactions at zero and finite temperatures. We use path\nintegral quantum Monte Carlo with worm updates in our calculations at finite\ninteraction strengths, and the Bose-Fermi mapping in the Tonks-Girardeau\nregime. We discuss the homogeneous case and, within the local density\napproximation, use it to motivate the scaling in the presence of a harmonic\ntrap. For the momentum distribution function, we pay special attention to the\nhigh momentum tails and their $k^{-4}$ asymptotic behavior.\n", "  We present a one-parameter family of exact solutions to Einstein equations\nthat may be used to study the nature of the Green-Wald backreaction framework.\nOur explicit example is a family of Einstein-Rosen waves coupled to a massless\nscalar field. This solution may be reinterpreted as a generalized three-torus\npolarized Gowdy cosmology with scalar and gravitational waves. We use it to\nillustrate essential properties of the Green-Wald approach. Among other things\nwe show that within our model the Green-Wald framework uniquely determines\nbackreaction for finite size inhomogeneities on a predefined background. The\nresults agree with those calculated in the Charach-Malin approach. In the\nvacuum limit, the Green-Wald, the Charach-Malin and the Isaacson method imply\nidentical backreaction as expected.\n", "  We study the effect of thermal fluctuations in the XY-model on a surface with\nnon vanishing mean curvature and zero Gaussian curvature. Unlike Gaussian\ncurvature that typically frustrates orientational order, the extrinsic\ncurvature of the surface can act as a local field that promotes long range\norder at low temperature. We find numerically that the transition from the high\ntemperature isotropic phase to the true long range ordered phase is\ncharacterized by critical exponents consistent with those of the flat space\nIsing model in two dimensions, up to finite size effects. Our results suggest a\nversatile strategy to achieve geometric control of liquid crystal order by\nsuitable design of the underlying curvature of a substrate or bounding surface.\n", "  We consider cosmological inflation generated by a scalar field slowly rolling\noff from a de Sitter maximum of its potential. The models belong to the class\nof hilltop models and represent the most general model of this kind in which\nthe scalar potential can be written as the sum of two exponentials. The\nminimally coupled Einstein-scalar gravity theory obtained in this way is the\ncosmological version of a two-scale generalization of known holographic models,\nallowing for solitonic solutions interpolating between an AdS spacetime in the\ninfrared and scaling solutions in the ultraviolet. We then investigate\ncosmological inflation in the slow-roll approximation. Our model reproduces\ncorrectly, for a wide range of its parameters, the most recent experimental\ndata for the power spectrum of primordial perturbations. Moreover, it predicts\ninflation at energy scales of four to five orders of magnitude below the Planck\nscale. At the onset of inflation, the mass of the tachyonic excitation, i.e. of\nthe inflaton, turns out to be seven to eight orders of magnitude smaller than\nthe Planck mass.\n", "  Lecture notes in french of the lecture on surface tension given in 2015 and\n2016 at the preparation to \"Agr\\'egation de physique\" in the Ecole Normale\nSup\\'erieure de Lyon\n", "  A dependence of phonon interaction on the interelectronic distance is found\nfor a translation-invariant (TI) strong-coupling bipolaron. It is shown that\nthe charge induced by the electrons in a TI-bipolaron state is always greater\nthan that in a bipolaron with spontaneously broken symmetry.\n", "  We present a study of longitudinal momentum densities ($p^+ \\rm densities$)\nin the transverse impact parameter space for $u$ and $d$ quarks in both\nunpolarized and transversely polarized nucleons by taking a two dimensional\nFourier transform of the gravitational form factors with respect to the\nmomentum transfer in the transverse direction. The gravitational form factors\nare obtained by the second moments of GPDs. Here we consider the GPDs of two\ndifferent soft-wall models in AdS/QCD correspondence.\n", "  Applying the Pomeransky inverse scattering method to the four-dimensional\nvacuum Einstein equations and using the Levi-Civita solution as a seed, we\nconstruct a two-soliton solution with cylindrical symmetry. In our previous\nwork, we constructed the one-soliton solution with a real pole and showed that\nthe singularities that the Levi-Civita background has on an axis can be removed\nby the choice of certain special parameters, but it still has unavoidable null\nsingularities, as usual one-solitons do. In this work, we show that for the\ntwo-soliton solutions, any singularities can be removed by suitable\nparameter-setting and such solutions describe the propagation of gravitational\nwave packets. Moreover, in terms of the two-soliton solutions, we mention a\ntime shift phenomenon, the coalescence and the split of solitons as the\nnonlinear effect of gravitational waves.\n", "  We employ dispersion-corrected density-functional theory to study the\nadsorption of tetrapyrrole 2H-porphine (2H-P) at Cu(111) and Ag(111). Various\ncontributions to adsorbate-substrate and adsorbate-adsorbate interactions are\nsystematically extracted to analyze the self-assembly behavior of this basic\nbuilding block to porphyrin-based metal-organic nanostructures. This analysis\nreveals a surprising importance of substrate-mediated van der Waals\ninteractions between 2H-P molecules, in contrast to negligible direct\ndispersive interactions. The resulting net repulsive interactions rationalize\nthe experimentally observed tendency for single molecule adsorption.\n", "  Emergence of novel quantum ground states in correlated electron systems with\nstrong spin-orbit coupling has been a recent subject of intensive studies.\nWhile it has been realized that spin-orbit coupling can provide non-trivial\nband topology in weakly interacting electron systems, as in topological\ninsulators and semi-metals, the role of electron-electron interaction in\nstrongly spin-orbit coupled systems has not been fully understood. The\navailability of new materials with significant electron correlation and strong\nspin-orbit coupling now makes such investigations possible. Many of these\nmaterials contain 5d or 4d transition metal elements; the prominent examples\nare iridium oxides or iridates. In this review, we succinctly discuss recent\ntheoretical and experimental progress on this subject. After providing a brief\noverview, we focus on pyrochlore iridates and three-dimensional honeycomb\niridates. In pyrochlore iridates, we discuss the quantum criticality of the\nbulk and surface states, and the relevance of the surface/boundary states in a\nnumber of topological and magnetic ground states, both in the bulk and thin\nfilm configurations. Experimental signatures of these boundary and bulk states\nare discussed. Domain wall formation and strongly-direction-dependent\nmagneto-transport are also discussed. Regarding the three-dimensional honeycomb\niridates, we consider possible quantum spin liquid phases and unusual magnetic\norders in theoretical models with strongly bond-dependent interactions. These\ntheoretical ideas and results are discussed in light of recent resonant X-ray\nscattering experiments on three-dimensional honeycomb iridates. We also\ncontrast these results with the situation in two-dimensional honeycomb\niridates. We conclude with the outlook on other related systems.\n", "  I calculate the mixed threetangle $\\tau_3[\\rho]$ for the reduced density\nmatrices of the four-qubit representant states found in Phys. Rev. A {\\bf 65},\n052112 (2002). In most of the cases, the convex roof is obtained, except for\none class, where I provide with a new upper bound, which is assumed to be very\nclose to the convex roof. I compare with results published in Phys. Rev. Lett.\n{\\bf 113}, 110501 (2014). Since the method applied there usually results in\nhigher values for the upper bound, in certain cases it can be understood that\nthe convex roof is obtained exactly, namely when the zero-polytope where\n$\\tau_3$ vanishes shrinks to a single point.\n", "  We propose a manifestly Lorentz covariant, non-commutative Dirac equation for\ncharged particles interacting with an electromagnetic field. The equation is\nformulated on the operator level, but operators are not composed through the\nnormal operator product, but a modified product that restores the Lorentz\ncovariance. This equation is solved for the free particle and a particle moving\nin a constant magnetic field. An abstract action, constructed on the operator\nlevel, that yields this equation as equation of motion is also derived. To\nrelate this formalism to current formulations of non-commutative quantum field\ntheories, this action is written in a coherent state basis, leading to an\naction in 4-dimensional Minkowski space-time. The resulting action differs from\nexisting non-commutative actions, but still exhibits non-commutative effects\nthrough non-locality.\n", "  Instanton rate theory is used to study tunneling events in a wide range of\nsystems including low-temperature chemical reactions. Despite many successful\napplications, the method has never been obtained from first principles, relying\ninstead on the \"ImF\" premise. In this paper, the same expression for the rate\nof barrier penetration at finite temperature is rederived from quantum\nscattering theory [W. H. Miller, S. D. Schwartz, and J. W. Tromp, J. Chem.\nPhys. 79, 4889 (1983)] using a semiclassical Green's function formalism. This\njustifies the instanton approach and provides a route to deriving the rate of\nother processes.\n", "  All-trans-retinoic acid (ReA), a closed-shell organic molecule comprising\nonly C, H, and O atoms, is investigated on a Au(111) substrate using scanning\ntunneling microscopy and spectroscopy. In dense arrays single ReA molecules are\nswitched to a number of states, three of which carry a localized spin as\nevidenced by conductance spectroscopy in high magnetic fields. The spin of a\nsingle molecule may be reversibly switched on and off without affecting its\nneighbors. We suggest that ReA on Au is readily converted to a radical by the\nabstraction of an electron.\n", "  An algorithm is proposed that serves to handle full rank density matrices,\nwhen coming from a lower rank method to compute the convex-roof. This is in\norder to calculate an upper bound for any polynomial SL invariant multipartite\nentanglement measure E. Here, it is exemplifyed how this algorithm works, based\non a method for calculating convex-roofs of rank two density matrices. It\niteratively considers the decompositions of the density matrix into two states\neach, exploiting the knowledge for the rank-two case. The algorithm is\ntherefore quasi exact as far as the two rank case is concerned, and it also\ngives hints where it should include more states in the decomposition of the\ndensity matrix. Focusing on the threetangle, I show the results the algorithm\ngives for two states, one of which being the $GHZ$-Werner state, for which the\nexact convex roof is known. It overestimates the threetangle in the state,\nthereby giving insight into the optimal decomposition the $GHZ$-Werner state\nhas. As a proof of principle, I have run the algorithm for the threetangle on\nthe transverse quantum Ising model. I give qualitative and quantitative\narguments why the convex roof should be close to the upper bound found here.\n", "  We study cholesteric order in liquid crystal shells with planar degenerate\nanchoring. We observe that the bipolar and radial configurations intensively\nreported for bulk droplets have a higher degree of complexity when the liquid\ncrystal is confined to a spherical shell. The bipolar configuration is replaced\nby a structure where the boojums are linked to a stack of disclination rings\nthat spans the shell, while the radial configuration exhibits a double helix\nstructure where two disclinations wind around each other. Our results confirm\nrecent numerical simulations and highlight the complexity of the defect\nstructures arising when cholesteric liquid crystals are confined to spherical\ngeometries. We also show that the position of the boojums is only ruled by the\nshell geometry, independently of the cholesteric pitch. To understand\nquantitatively this behavior, we develop a simple yet insightful theoretical\nframework which captures the essence of the observed phenomenology. We also\nshow that the transition between the two configurations is solely governed by\nthe confinement ratio c = h/p, where h is the average shell thickness and p is\nthe cholesteric pitch. Finally, we perform a dynamical study of this\ntransition, and report a fascinating defect waltz due to a chemical Lehmann\neffect.\n", "  Using the ultrafast pump-probe transient absorption spectroscopy, the\nfemtosecond-resolved plasmon-exciton interaction of graphene-Ag nanowire\nhybrids is experimentally investigated, in the VIS-NIR region. The plasmonic\nlifetime of Ag nanowire is about 150 femtosecond (fs). For a single layer of\ngraphene, the fast dynamic process at 275 fs is due to the excitation of\ngraphene excitons, and the slow process at 1.4 picosecond (ps) is due to the\nplasmonic hot electron interaction with phonons of graphene. For the\ngraphene-Ag nanowire hybrids, the time scale of the plasmon-induced hot\nelectron transferring to graphene is 534 fs, and the metal plasmon enhanced\ngraphene plasmon is about 3.2 ps in the VIS region. The graphene-Ag nanowire\nhybrids can be used for plasmon-driven chemical reactions. This\ngraphene-mediated surface-enhanced Raman scattering substrate significantly\nincreases the probability and efficiency of surface catalytic reactions\nco-driven by graphene-Ag nanowire hybridization, in comparison with reactions\nindividually driven by monolayer graphene or single Ag nanowire. This implies\nthat the graphene-Ag nanowire hybrids can not only lead to a significant\naccumulation of high-density hot electrons, but also significantly increase the\nplasmon-to-electron conversion efficiency, due to strong plasmon-exciton\ncoupling.\n", "  Today's textbooks of electromagnetism give the particular solution to\nMaxwell's equations involving the integral over the charge and current sources\nat retarded times. However, the texts fail to emphasize the role played by the\nchoice of the boundary conditions corresponding to solutions of the homogeneous\nMaxwell equations. Here we discuss the role of these boundary conditions for an\nexperimenter with a hypothetical charged harmonic oscillator as his equipment.\nWe describe the observations of the experimenter when located near a radio\nstation or immersed in thermal radiation at temperature T. The classical\nphysicists at the end of the 19th century chose the homogeneous boundary\nconditions for Maxwell's equation based upon the experimental observations of\nLummer and Pringsheim which measured only the thermal radiation which exceeded\nthe random radiation surrounding their measuring equipment. Today at the\nbeginning of the 21st century, classical physicists must choose the homogeneous\nboundary conditions for Maxell's equations to correspond to the full radiation\nspectrum revealed by the recent Casimir force measurements which detect all the\nradiation surrounding conducting parallel plates, including the radiation\nabsorbed and emitted by the plates themselves. The random classical radiation\nspectrum revealed by the Casimir force measurements includes electromagnetic\nzero-point radiation, which is missing from the spectrum measured by Lummer and\nPringsheim, and which cannot be eliminated by going to zero temperature. This\nzero-point radiation will lead to zero-point energy for all systems which have\nelectromagnetic interactions. Thus the choice of the boundary conditions on the\nhomogeneous Maxwell equations is intimately related to the ideas of zero-point\nenergy and non-radiating ground states which are introduced in classes of\nmodern physics.\n", "  We derive the stellar mass fraction in the galaxy cluster RXC J2248.7-4431\nobserved with the Dark Energy Survey (DES) during the Science Verification\nperiod. We compare the stellar mass results from DES (five filters) with those\nfrom the Hubble Space Telescope Cluster Lensing And Supernova Survey (CLASH; 17\nfilters). When the cluster spectroscopic redshift is assumed, we show that\nstellar masses from DES can be estimated within 25% of CLASH values. We compute\nthe stellar mass contribution coming from red and blue galaxies, and study the\nrelation between stellar mass and the underlying dark matter using weak lensing\nstudies with DES and CLASH. An analysis of the radial profiles of the DES total\nand stellar mass yields a stellar-to-total fraction of f*=(6.8+-1.7)x10^-3\nwithin a radius of r_200c~2 Mpc. Our analysis also includes a comparison of\nphotometric redshifts and star/galaxy separation efficiency for both data sets.\nWe conclude that space-based small field imaging can be used to calibrate the\ngalaxy properties in DES for the much wider field of view. The technique\ndeveloped to derive the stellar mass fraction in galaxy clusters can be applied\nto the ~100 000 clusters that will be observed within this survey and yield\nimportant information about galaxy evolution.\n", "  Black hole-neutron star mergers are among the promising gravitational-wave\nsources for ground-based detectors, and gravitational waves from black\nhole-neutron star mergers are expected to be detected in the next few years.\nSimultaneous detection of electromagnetic counterparts with gravitational-wave\ndetection provides rich information about the merger events. Among the possible\nelectromagnetic counterparts from the black hole-neutron star merger, the\nemission powered by the decay of radioactive r-process nuclei, so called\nkilonova/macronova, is one of the best targets for follow-up observation. We\nderive fitting formulas for the mass and the velocity of ejecta from a generic\nblack hole-neutron star merger based on recently performed numerical relativity\nsimulations. We combined these fitting formulas with a new semi-analytic model\nfor a black hole-neutron star kilonova/macronova lightcurve which reproduces\nthe results of radiation-transfer simulations. Specifically, the semi-analytic\nmodel reproduces the result of each band magnitude obtained by the radiation\ntransfer simulations within ~1 mag. By using this semi-analytic model, we found\nthat, at 400 Mpc, the kilonova/macronova is as bright as 22-24 mag for the\ncases with a small chirp mass and a high black hole spin, and >28 mag for a\nlarge chirp mass and a low black hole spin. We also apply our model to\nGRB130603B as an illustration, and show that a black hole-neutron star merger\nwith a rapidly spinning black hole and a large neutron star radius is favored.\n", "  Explaining observations in terms of causes and effects is central to all of\nempirical science. Correlations between entangled quantum particles, however,\nseem to defy such an explanation. To recover a causal picture in this case,\nsome of the fundamental assumptions of causal explanations have to give way.\nHere we consider a broad class of models where one of these assumptions, Bell's\nlocal causality, is relaxed by allowing a direct influence from one measurement\noutcome to the other. We use interventional and observational data from a\nphotonic experiment to bound the strength of this causal influence in a\ntwo-party Bell scenario and test a novel Bell-type inequality for the\nconsidered models. Our results demonstrate the incompatibility of quantum\nmechanics with an important class of nonlocal causal models, which includes\nBell's original model as a special case. Recovering a classical causal picture\nof quantum correlations thus requires an even more counter-intuitive\nmodification of our classical notion of cause and effect.\n", "  A model of a universe without big bang singularity is presented, which\ndisplaysanearly inflationary period ending just before a phase transition to a\ndeflationary epoch. The model produces enough heavy particles so as to reheat\nthe universe at temperatures in the MeV regime. After the reheating, it\nsmoothly matches the standard $\\Lambda$CDM scenario.\n", "  We explore the coherent control of nonlinear absorption of intense laser\nfields in four-level atomic systems. For instance, in a four-level ladder\nsystem, a coupling field creates electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT)\nwith Aulter-Townes doublet for the probe field while the control field is\nabsent. A large absorption peak appears at resonance as the control field is\nswitched on. We show how such a large absorption leads to optical switching.\nFurther, this large absorption gets diminished and a transparency window\nappears due to the saturation effects as the strength of the probe field is\nincreased. We further demonstrate that the threshold of the optical bistability\ncan be modified by suitable choices of the coupling and the control fields. In\na four-level Y-type configuration, the effect of the control field on saturable\nabsorption (SA) and reverse saturable absorption (RSA) is highlighted in the\ncontext of nonlinear absorption of the probe field. We achieve RSA and SA in a\nsimple atomic system just by applying a control field.\n", "  We present combined measurements of the spatially-resolved optical spectrum\nand the total excited-atom number in an ultracold gas of three-level atoms\nunder electromagnetically induced transparency conditions involving high-lying\nRydberg states. The observed optical transmission of a weak probe laser at the\ncenter of the coupling region exhibits a double peaked spectrum as a function\nof detuning, whilst the Rydberg atom number shows a comparatively narrow single\nresonance. By imaging the transmitted light onto a charge-coupled-device\ncamera, we record hundreds of spectra in parallel, which are used to map out\nthe spatial profile of Rabi frequencies of the coupling laser. Using all the\ninformation available we can reconstruct the full one-body density matrix of\nthe three-level system, which provides the optical susceptibility and the\nRydberg density as a function of spatial position. These results help elucidate\nthe connection between three-level interference phenomena, including the\ninterplay of matter and light degrees of freedom and will facilitate new\nstudies of many-body effects in optically driven Rydberg gases.\n", "  Physical systems with loss or gain feature resonant modes that are decaying\nor growing exponentially with time. Whenever two such modes coalesce both in\ntheir resonant frequency and their rate of decay or growth, a so-called\n\"exceptional point\" occurs, around which many fascinating phenomena have\nrecently been reported to arise. Particularly intriguing behavior is predicted\nto appear when encircling an exceptional point sufficiently slowly, like a\nstate-flip or the accumulation of a geometric phase. Experiments dedicated to\nthis issue could already successfully explore the topological structure of\nexceptional points, but a full dynamical encircling and the breakdown of\nadiabaticity inevitably associated with it remained out of reach of any\nmeasurement so far. Here we demonstrate that a dynamical encircling of an\nexceptional point can be mapped onto the problem of scattering through a\ntwo-mode waveguide, which allows us for the first time to access the elusive\neffects occurring in this context. Specifically, we present experimental\nresults from a waveguide structure that steers incoming waves around an\nexceptional point during the transmission process. In this way mode transitions\nare induced that make this device perfectly suited as a robust and asymmetric\nswitch between different waveguide modes. Our work opens up new and exciting\navenues to explore exceptional point physics at the crossroads between\nfundamental research and practical applications.\n", "  We investigate the thermal and electronic collective fluctuations that\ncontribute to the finite-temperature adsorption properties of flexible\nadsorbates on surfaces on the example of the molecular switch azobenzene\nC$_{12}$H$_{10}$N$_{2}$ on the Ag(111) surface. Using first-principles\nmolecular dynamics simulations we obtain the free energy of adsorption that\naccurately accounts for entropic contributions, whereas the inclusion of\nmany-body dispersion interactions accounts for the electronic correlations that\ngovern the adsorbate binding. We find the adsorbate properties to be strongly\nentropy-driven, as can be judged by a kinetic molecular desorption prefactor of\n10$^{24}$ s$^{-1}$ that largely exceeds previously reported estimates. We\nrelate this effect to sizable fluctuations across structural and electronic\nobservables. Comparison of our calculations to temperature-programmed\ndesorption measurements demonstrates that finite-temperature effects play a\ndominant role for flexible molecules in contact with polarizable surfaces, and\nthat recently developed first-principles methods offer an optimal tool to\nreveal novel collective behavior in such complex systems.\n", "  We operationally introduce mixed quantum t-designs as the most general\narbitrary-rank extension of projective quantum t-designs which preserves\nindistinguishability from the uniform distribution for t copies. First, we\nderive upper bounds on the classical communication capacity of any mixed\nt-design measurement for t in [1,5]. Second, we explicitly compute the\nclassical communication capacity of several mixed t-design measurements,\nincluding the depolarized version of any qubit and qutrit symmetric,\ninformationally complete (SIC) measurement and complete mutually unbiased\nbases, the qubit icosahedral measurement, the Hoggar SIC measurement, any\nanti-SIC (where each element is proportional to the projector on the subspace\northogonal to one of the elements of the original SIC), and the uniform\ndistribution over pure effects.\n", "  Stellar spectra depend on the stellar parameters and on dozens of\nphotospheric elemental abundances. Simultaneous fitting of these\n$\\mathcal{N}\\sim 10-40$ model labels to observed spectra has been deemed\nunfeasible, because the number of ab initio spectral model grid calculations\nscales exponentially with $\\mathcal{N}$. We suggest instead the construction of\na polynomial spectral model (PSM) of order $\\mathcal{O}$ for the model flux at\neach wavelength. Building this approximation requires a minimum of only\n${\\mathcal{N}+\\mathcal{O}\\choose\\mathcal{O}}$ calculations: e.g. a quadratic\nspectral model ($\\mathcal{O}=2$) to fit $\\mathcal{N}=20$ labels simultaneously,\ncan be constructed from as few as $231$ ab initio spectral model calculations;\nin practice, a somewhat larger number ($\\sim 300-1000$) of randomly chosen\nmodels lead to a better performing PSM. Such a PSM can be a good approximation\nonly over a portion of label space, which will vary case by case. Yet, taking\nthe APOGEE survey as an example, a single quadratic PSM provides a remarkably\ngood approximation to the exact ab initio spectral models across much of this\nsurvey: for random labels within that survey the PSM approximates the flux to\nwithin $10^{-3}$, and recovers the abundances to within $\\sim 0.02$ dex rms of\nthe exact models. This enormous speed-up enables the simultaneous many-label\nfitting of spectra with computationally expensive ab initio models for stellar\nspectra, such as non-LTE models. A PSM also enables the simultaneous fitting of\nobservational parameters, such as the spectrum's continuum or line-spread\nfunction.\n", "  Growth in static and controlled environments such as a Petri dish can be used\nto study the spatial population dynamics of microorganisms. However, natural\npopulations such as marine microbes experience fluid advection and often grow\nup in heterogeneous environments. We investigate a generalized\nFisher-Kolmogorov-Petrovsky-Piscounov (FKPP) equation describing single species\npopulation subject to a constant flow field and quenched random spatially\ninhomogeneous growth rates with a fertile overall growth condition. We\nanalytically and numerically demonstrate that the non-equilibrium steady-state\npopulation density develops a flow-driven striation pattern. The striations are\nhighly asymmetric with a longitudinal correlation length that diverges linearly\nwith the flow speed and a transverse correlation length that approaches a\nfinite velocity-independent value. Linear response theory is developed to study\nthe statistics of the steady states. Theoretical predictions show excellent\nagreement with the numerical steady states of the generalized FKPP equation\nobtained from Lattice Boltzmann simulations. These findings suggest that,\nalthough the growth disorder can be spatially uncorrelated, correlated\npopulation structures with striations emerge naturally at sufficiently strong\nadvection.\n", "  Due to the recent experimental progress, tunable spin-orbit (SO) interactions\nrepresent ideal candidates for the control of polarization and dynamical spin\nproperties in both quantum wells and cold atomic systems. A detailed\nunderstanding of spin properties in SO coupled systems is thus a compelling\nprerequisite for possible novel applications or improvements in the context of\nspintronics and quantum computers. Here we analyze the case of equal Rashba and\nDresselhaus couplings in both homogeneous and laterally confined\ntwo-dimensional systems. Starting from the single-particle picture and\nsubsequently introducing two-body interactions we observe that periodic spin\nfluctuations can be induced and maintained in the system. Through an analytical\nderivation we show that the two-body interaction does not involve decoherence\neffects in the bosonic dimer, and, in the repulsive homogeneous Fermi gas it\nmay be even exploited in combination with the SO coupling to induce and tune\nstanding currents. By further studying the effects of a harmonic lateral\nconfinement --a particularly interesting case for Bose condensates-- we\nevidence the possible appearance of non-trivial {\\it spin textures}, whereas\nthe further application of a small Zeeman-type interaction can be exploited to\nfine-tune the system polarizability.\n", "  We examine the scaling with activity of the emergent length scales that\ncontrol the nonequilibrium dynamics of an active nematic liquid crystal, using\ntwo popular hydrodynamic models that have been employed in previous studies. In\nboth models we find that the chaotic spatio-temporal dynamics in the regime of\nfully developed active turbulence is controlled by a single active scale\ndetermined by the balance of active and elastic stresses, regardless of whether\nthe active stress is extensile or contractile in nature. The observed scaling\nof the kinetic energy and enstropy with activity is consistent with our\nsingle-length scale argument and simple dimensional analysis. Our results\nprovide a unified understanding of apparent discrepancies in the previous\nliterature and demonstrate that the essential physics is robust to the choice\nof model.\n", "  We introduce a system-independent method to derive effective atomic C$_6$\ncoefficients and polarizabilities in molecules and materials purely from charge\npopulation analysis. This enables the use of dispersion-correction schemes in\nelectronic structure calculations without recourse to electron-density\npartitioning schemes and expands their applicability to semi-empirical methods\nand tight-binding Hamiltonians. We show that the accuracy of our method is en\npar with established electron-density partitioning based approaches in\ndescribing intermolecular C$_6$ coefficients as well as dispersion energies of\nweakly bound molecular dimers, organic crystals, and supramolecular complexes.\nWe showcase the utility of our approach by incorporation of the recently\ndeveloped many-body dispersion (MBD) method [Tkatchenko et al., Phys. Rev.\nLett. 108, 236402 (2012)] into the semi-empirical Density Functional\nTight-Binding (DFTB) method and propose the latter as a viable technique to\nstudy hybrid organic-inorganic interfaces.\n", "  We report the detection of thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect (SZ) fluctuations\nin the intracluster medium (ICM) of Coma cluster observed with ${\\it Planck}$.\nThe SZ data links the maximum observable X-ray scale to the large Mpc scale,\nextending our knowledge of the power spectrum of ICM fluctuations. Deprojecting\nthe 2-d SZ perturbations into 3-d pressure fluctuations, we find an amplitude\nspectrum which peaks at $\\delta P/P = 33\\pm 12\\%$ and $74\\pm19\\%$ in the $15'$\nand $40'$ radius region, respectively. We perform tests to ensure fluctuations\nare intrinsic to the cluster and not due to noise contamination. By using\nhigh-resolution hydrodynamical models, we improve the ICM turbulence\nconstraints in Coma, finding 3-d Mach number ${\\rm Ma_{3d}}= 0.8\\pm0.3$ (15'\nregion), increasing to supersonic values at larger radii (40'), and an\ninjection scale $L_{\\rm inj}\\approx 500$ kpc. Such properties are consistent\nwith driving due to mergers, in particular tied to internal galaxy groups. The\nlarge pressure fluctuations show that Coma is in adiabatic mode (mediated by\nsound waves), rather than isobaric mode (mediated by buoyancy waves). As\npredicted by turbulence models, the distribution of SZ fluctuations is\nlog-normal with mild non-Gaussianities (heavy tails). The substantial\nnon-thermal pressure support implies hydrostatic mass bias $b_M=-15\\%$ to\n$-45\\%$ from the core to the outskirt region, respectively. While total SZ\npower probes the thermal energy content, the SZ fluctuations constrain the\nnon-thermal deviations important for precision cosmology. The proposed, novel\napproach can be exploited by multifrequency observations using ground based\ninterferometers and future space CMB missions.\n", "  Acousto-optic interaction in optomechanical crystals allows unidirectional\ncontrol of elastic waves over optical waves. However, as a result of this\nnonlinear interaction, infinitely many optical modes are born. This article\npresents an exact formulaion of coupled mode theory for interaction between\nelastic and photonic Bloch waves moving along an optomechanical waveguide. In\ngeneral, an optical wavefront is strongly diffracted by an elastic wave in\nfrequency and wavevector, and thus infinite modes with different frequencies\nand wavevectors appear. We discuss resonance and mode conversion conditions,\nand present a rigorous method to derive coupling rates and mode profiles. We\nalso find a conservation law which rules over total optical power from\ninteracting individual modes. We present application examples to the theory to\noptomechanical waveguides and cavities, as well as non-reciprocal transmission\nof light and optomechanical switches.\n", "  Recent progress in manipulating atomic and condensed matter systems has\ninstigated a surge of interest in non-equilibrium physics, including many-body\ndynamics of trapped ultracold atoms and ions, near-field radiative heat\ntransfer, and quantum friction. Under most circumstances the complexity of such\nnon-equilibrium systems requires a number of approximations to make theoretical\ndescriptions tractable. In particular, it is often assumed that spatially\nseparated components of a system thermalize with their immediate surroundings,\nalthough the global state of the system is out of equilibrium. This powerful\nassumption reduces the complexity of non-equilibrium systems to the local\napplication of well-founded equilibrium concepts. While this technique appears\nto be consistent for the description of some phenomena, we show that it fails\nfor quantum friction by underestimating by approximately $80 \\%$ the magnitude\nof the drag force. Our results show that the correlations among components of\ndriven, but steady-state, quantum systems invalidate the assumption of local\nthermal equilibrium, calling for a critical reexamination of this approach for\ndescribing the physics of non-equilibrium systems.\n", "  We study grain boundaries between striped phases in the prototypical\nSwift-Hohenberg equation. We propose an analytical and numerical far-field-core\ndecomposition that allows us to study existence and bifurcations of grain\nboundaries analytically and numerically using continuation techniques. This\ndecomposition overcomes problems with computing grain boundaries in a large\ndoubly periodic box with phase conditions. Using the spatially conserved\nquantities of the time-independent Swift-Hohenberg equation, we show that\nsymmetric grain boundaries must select the marginally zig-zag stable stripes.\nWe find that as the angle between the stripes is decreased, the symmetric grain\nboundary undergoes a parity-breaking pitchfork bifurcation where dislocations\nat the grain boundary split into disclination pairs. A plethora of asymmetric\ngrain boundaries (with different angles of the far-field stripes either side of\nthe boundary) is found and investigated. The energy of the grain boundaries is\nthen mapped out. We find that when the angle between the stripes is greater\nthan a critical angle, the symmetric grain boundary is energetically preferred\nwhile when the angle is less than the critical angle, the grain boundaries\nwhere stripes on one side are parallel to the interface are energetically\npreferred. Finally, we propose a classification of grain boundaries that allows\nus to predict various non-standard asymmetric grain boundaries.\n", "  We study numerically the crystallization of a hard-sphere mixture with 8\\%\npolydispersity. Although often used as a model glass former, for small system\nsizes we observe crystallization in molecular dynamics simulations. This opens\nthe possibility to study the competition between crystallization and structural\nrelaxation of the melt, which typically is out of reach due to the disparate\ntimescales. We quantify the dependence of relaxation and crystallization times\non density and system size. For one density and system size we perform a\ndetailed committor analysis to investigate the suitability of local structures\nas order parameters to describe the crystallization process. We find that local\nstructures are strongly correlated with generic bond order and add little\ninformation to the reaction coordinate.\n", "  A general quantum-mechanical setting is proposed for the field-antifield\nformalism as a unique hyper-gauge theory in the field-antifield space. We\nformulate a Schr\\\"odinger-type equation to describe the quantum evolution in a\n\"current time\" purely formal in its nature. The corresponding Hamiltonian is\ndefined in the form of a supercommutator of the delta-operator with a\nhyper-gauge Fermion. The initial wave function is restricted to be annihilated\nwith the delta-operator. The Schr\\\"odinger's equation is resolved in a closed\nform of the path integral, whose action contains the symmetric Weyl's symbol of\nthe Hamiltonian. We take the path integral explicitly in the case of being a\nhyper-gauge Fermion an arbitrary function rather than an operator.\n", "  We present a new supersymmetric, asymptotically flat, black hole solution to\nfive-dimensional U(1)^3-supergravity which is regular on and outside an event\nhorizon of lens space topology L(2,1). The solution has seven independent\nparameters and uplifts to a family of 1/8-supersymmetric D1-D5-P black brane\nsolutions to Type IIB supergravity. The decoupling limit is asymptotically\nAdS(3) x S^3 x T^4, with a near-horizon geometry that is a twisted product of\nthe near-horizon geometry of the extremal BTZ black hole and L(2,1) x T^4,\nalthough it is not (locally) a product space in the bulk. We show that the\ndecoupling limit of a special case of the black lens is related to that of a\nblack ring by spectral flow, thereby supplying an account of its entropy.\nAnalogous solutions of U(1)^N-supergravity are also presented.\n", "  The production of a stochastic background of gravitational waves is a\nfundamental prediction of any cosmological inflationary model. The features of\nsuch a signal encode unique information about the physics of the Early Universe\nand beyond, thus representing an exciting, powerful window on the origin and\nevolution of the Universe. We review the main mechanisms of gravitational-wave\nproduction, ranging from quantum fluctuations of the gravitational field to\nother mechanisms that can take place during or after inflation. These include\ne.g. gravitational waves generated as a consequence of extra particle\nproduction during inflation, or during the (p)reheating phase. Gravitational\nwaves produced in inflation scenarios based on modified gravity theories and\nsecond-order gravitational waves are also considered. For each analyzed case,\nthe expected power-spectrum is given. We discuss the discriminating power among\ndifferent models, associated with the validity/violation of the standard\nconsistency relation between tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ and tensor spectral\nindex $n_{\\rm T}$. In light of the prospects for (directly/indirectly)\ndetecting primordial gravitational waves, we give the expected present-day\ngravitational radiation spectral energy-density, highlighting the main\ncharacteristics imprinted by the cosmic thermal history, and we outline the\nsignatures left by gravitational waves on the Cosmic Microwave Background and\nsome imprints in the Large-Scale Structure of the Universe. Finally, current\nbounds and prospects of detection for inflationary gravitational waves are\nsummarized.\n", "  We develop a microscopic theory of a quantum impurity propagating in a\none-dimensional Bose liquid. As a result of scattering off thermally excited\nquasiparticles, the impurity experiences the friction. We find that, at low\ntemperatures, the resulting force scales either as the fourth or the eighth\npower of temperature, depending on the system parameters. For temperatures\nhigher than the chemical potential of the Bose liquid, the friction force is a\nlinear function of temperature. Our approach enables us to find the friction\nforce in the crossover region between the two limiting cases. In the integrable\ncase, corresponding to the Yang-Gaudin model, the impurity becomes transparent\nfor quasiparticles and thus the friction force is absent. Our results could be\nfurther generalized to study other kinetic phenomena.\n", "  Cooperative scattering has been the subject of intense research in the last\nyears. In this article, we discuss the concept of cooperative scattering from a\nbroad perspective. We briefly review the various collective effects that occur\nwhen light interacts with an ensemble of atoms. We show that some effects that\nhave been recently discussed in the context of 'single-photon superradiance',\nor cooperative scattering in the linear-optics regime, can also be explained by\n'standard optics', i.e., using macroscopic quantities such as the\nsusceptibility or the diffusion coefficient. We explain why some collective\neffects depend on the atomic density, and others on the optical depth. In\nparticular, we show that, for a large and dilute atomic sample driven by a\nfar-detuned laser, the decay of the fluorescence, which exhibits superradiant\nand subradiant dynamics, depends only on the on-resonance optical depth. We\nalso discuss the link between concepts that are independently studied in the\nquantum-optics community and in the mesoscopic-physics community. We show that\nthe coupled-dipole model predicts a departure from Ohm's law for the diffuse\nlight, that incoherent multiple scattering can induce a saturation of\nfluorescence and we also show the similarity between the weak-localization\ncorrection to the diffusion coefficient and the inaccuracy of Lorentz local\nfield correction to the susceptibility.\n", "  We experimentally study the crystallization of a monolayer of vibrated discs\nwith a built-in polar asymmetry, a model system of active liquids, and contrast\nit with that of vibrated isotropic discs. Increasing the packing fraction\n$\\phi$, the quasi-continuous crystallization reported for isotropic discs is\nreplaced by a transition, or a crossover towards a \"self-melting\" crystal.\nIncreasing the packing fraction from the liquid phase, clusters of dense\nhexagonally-ordered packed discs spontaneously form, melt, split and merge\nleading to a highly intermittent and heterogeneous dynamics. The resulting\nsteady state cluster size distribution decreases monotonically. For packing\nfraction larger than $\\phi^*$, a few large clusters span the system size and\nthe cluster size distribution becomes non monotonic, the transition being\nsigned by a power-law. The system is however never dynamically arrested. The\nclusters permanently melt from place to place forming droplets of active liquid\nwhich rapidly propagate across the system. This state of affair remains up to\nthe highest possible packing fraction questioning the stability of the crystal\nfor active discs, unless at ordered close packing.\n", "  Entanglement entropy (EE), a fundamental conception in quantum information\nfor characterizing entanglement, has been extensively employed to explore\nquantum phase transitions (QPTs). Although the conventional single-site\nmean-field (MF) approach successfully predicts the emergence of QPTs, it fails\nto include any entanglement. Here, for the first time, in the framework of a\ncluster MF treatment, we extract the signature of EE in the bosonic\nsuperfluid-insulator transitions. We consider a trimerized Kagome lattice of\ninteracting bosons, in which each trimer is treated as a cluster, and implement\nthe cluster MF treatment by decoupling all inter-trimer hopping. In addition to\nsuperfluid and integer insulator phases, we find that fractional insulator\nphases appear when the tunneling is dominated by the intra-trimer part. To\nquantify the residual bipartite entanglement in a cluster, we calculate the\nsecond-order Renyi entropy, which can be experimentally measured by quantum\ninterference of many-body twins. The second-order Renyi entropy itself is\ncontinuous everywhere, however, the continuousness of its first-order\nderivative breaks down at the phase boundary. This means that the bosonic\nsuperfluid-insulator transitions can still be efficiently captured by the\nresidual entanglement in our cluster MF treatment. Besides to the bosonic\nsuperfluid-insulator transitions, our cluster MF treatment may also be used to\ncapture the signature of EE for other QPTs in quantum superlattice models.\n", "  NASA's New Horizons spacecraft observed (15810) 1994 JR$_1$, a 3:2 resonant\nKupier Belt Object (KBO), using the LOng Range Reconnaissance Imager (LORRI) on\nNovember 2, 2015 from a distance of 1.85 AU, and again on April 7, 2016 from a\ndistance of 0.71 AU. These were the first close observations of any KBO other\nthan Pluto. Combining ground-based and Hubble Space Telecope (HST) observations\nat small phase angles and the LORRI observations at higher phase angles, we\nproduced the first disk-integrated solar phase curve of a typical KBO from\n$\\alpha$=0.6-58$^\\circ$. Observations at these geometries, attainable only from\na spacecraft in the outer Solar System, constrain surface properties such as\nmacroscopic roughness and the single particle phase function. 1994 JR$_1$ has a\nrough surface with a 37$\\pm$5$^\\circ$ mean topographic slope angle and has a\nrelatively rapid rotation period of 5.47$\\pm$0.33 hours. 1994 JR$_1$ is\ncurrently 2.7 AU from Pluto; our astrometric points enable high-precision orbit\ndetermination and integrations which show that it comes this close to Pluto\nevery 2.4 million years (10$^4$ heliocentric orbits), causing Pluto to perturb\n1994 JR$_1$. During the November spacecraft observation, the KBO was\nsimultaneously observed using HST in two colors, confirming its very red\nspectral slope. These observations have laid the groundwork for numerous\npotential future distant KBO observations in the New Horizons-Kuiper Belt\nExtended Mission.\n", "  The total mass density of the Universe appears to be dominated by dark\nmatter. However, beyond its gravitational interactions at the galactic scale,\nlittle is known about its nature. Extensions of the quantum electrodynamics\nLagrangian with dark-matter coupling terms may result in changes to Standard\nModel parameters. Recently, it was proposed that a network of atomic clocks\ncould be used to search for transient signals of a hypothetical dark matter in\nthe form of stable topological defects. The clocks become desynchronized when a\ndark-matter object sweeps through the network. This pioneering approach, which\nis applicable only for distant clocks, is limited by the quality of the fibre\nlinks. Here, we present an alternative experimental approach that is applicable\nto both closely spaced and distant optical atomic clocks and benefits from\ntheir individual susceptibilities to dark matter, hence not requiring fibre\nlinks. We explore a new dimension of astrophysical observations by constraining\nthe strength of atomic coupling to the hypothetical dark-matter cosmic objects.\nOur experimental constraint exceeds the previous limits; in fact, it not only\nreaches the ultimate level expected to be achievable with a constellation of\nGPS atomic clocks but also has a large potential for improvement.\n", "  Adsorption geometry and stability of organic molecules on surfaces are key\nparameters that determine the observable properties and functions of hybrid\ninorganic/organic systems (HIOSs). Despite many recent advances in precise\nexperimental characterization and improvements in first-principles electronic\nstructure methods, reliable databases of structures and energetics for large\nadsorbed molecules are largely amiss. In this review, we present such a\ndatabase for a range of molecules adsorbed on metal single-crystal surfaces.\nThe systems we analyze include noble-gas atoms, conjugated aromatic molecules,\ncarbon nanostructures, and heteroaromatic compounds adsorbed on five different\nmetal surfaces. The overall objective is to establish a diverse benchmark\ndataset that enables an assessment of current and future electronic structure\nmethods, and motivates further experimental studies that provide ever more\nreliable data. Specifically, the benchmark structures and energetics from\nexperiment are here compared with the recently developed van der Waals (vdW)\ninclusive density-functional theory (DFT) method, DFT+vdW$^{\\mathrm{surf}}$. In\ncomparison to 23 adsorption heights and 17 adsorption energies from experiment\nwe find a mean average deviation of 0.06 \\AA{} and 0.16 eV, respectively. This\nconfirms the DFT+vdW$^{\\mathrm{surf}}$ method as an accurate and efficient\napproach to treat HIOSs. A detailed discussion identifies remaining challenges\nto be addressed in future development of electronic structure methods, for\nwhich the here presented benchmark database may serve as an important\nreference.\n", "  Randomized benchmarking is routinely used as an efficient method for\ncharacterizing the performance of sets of elementary logic gates in small\nquantum devices. In the measurement-based model of quantum computation, logic\ngates are implemented via single-site measurements on a fixed universal\nresource state. Here we adapt the randomized benchmarking protocol for a single\nqubit to a linear cluster state computation, which provides partial, yet\nefficient characterization of the noise associated with the target gate set.\nApplying randomized benchmarking to measurement-based quantum computation\nexhibits an interesting interplay between the inherent randomness associated\nwith logic gates in the measurement-based model and the random gate sequences\nused in benchmarking. We consider two different approaches: the first makes use\nof the standard single-qubit Clifford group, while the second uses recently\nintroduced (non-Clifford) measurement-based 2-designs, which harness inherent\nrandomness to implement gate sequences.\n", "  We experimentally investigate transport through the side junction between a\nniobium superconductor and the mesa edge of a two-dimensional system, realized\nin an InAs/GaSb double quantum well with band inversion. We demonstrate, that\ndifferent transport regimes can be achieved by variation of the mesa step. We\nobserve anomalous behavior of Andreev reflection within a finite low-bias\ninterval, which is invariant for both transport regimes. We connect this\nbehavior with the transition from retro- (at low biases) to specular (at high\nones) Andreev reflection channels in an InAs/GaSb double quantum well with band\ninversion.\n", "  We develop a polynomial reduction procedure that transforms any gauge fixed\nCHY amplitude integrand for $n$ scattering particles into a $\\sigma$-moduli\nmultivariate polynomial of what we call the $\\textit{standard form}$. We show\nthat a standard form polynomial must have a specific $\\textit{ladder type}$\nmonomial structure, which has finite size at any $n$, with highest multivariate\ndegree given by $(n-3)(n-4)/2$. This set of monomials spans a complete basis\nfor polynomials with rational coefficients in kinematic data on the support of\nscattering equations. Subsequently, at tree and one-loop level, we employ the\nglobal residue theorem to derive a prescription that evaluates any CHY\namplitude by means of collecting simple residues at infinity only. The\nprescription is then applied explicitly to some tree and one-loop amplitude\nexamples.\n", "  Considering $X(3940)$ and $X(4160)$ as $\\eta_c(3S)$ and $\\eta_c(4S)$, we\nstudy the productions of $X(3940)$ and $X(4160)$ in exclusive weak decays of\n$B_c$ meson by the improved Bethe-Salpeter(B-S) Method. Using the relativistic\nB-S equation and Mandelstam formalism, we calculate the corresponding decay\nform factors. The predictions of the corresponding branching ratios are:\n$Br(B_c^+\\to X(3940)e^+\\nu_e)$$=1.0\\times10^{-4}$ and $Br(B_c^+\\to\nX(4160)e^+\\nu_e)=2.4\\times10^{-5}$. That will provide us a new way to observe\nthe $X(3940)$ and $X(4160)$ in the future, as well as to improve the knowledge\nof $B_c$ meson decay.\n", "  Low-dimensional quantum magnets at finite temperatures present a complex\ninterplay of quantum and thermal fluctuation effects in a restricted phase\nspace. While some information about dynamical response functions is available\nfrom theoretical studies of the one-triplet dispersion in unfrustrated chains\nand ladders, little is known about the finite-temperature dynamics of\nfrustrated systems. Experimentally, inelastic neutron scattering studies of the\nhighly frustrated two-dimensional material SrCu$_2$(BO$_3$)$_2$ show an almost\ncomplete destruction of the one-triplet excitation band at a temperature only\n1/3 of its gap energy, accompanied by strong scattering intensities for\napparent multi-triplet excitations. We investigate these questions in the\nfrustrated spin ladder and present numerical results from exact diagonalization\nfor the dynamical structure factor as a function of temperature. We find\nanomalously rapid transfer of spectral weight out of the one-triplet band and\ninto both broad and sharp spectral features at a wide range of energies,\nincluding below the zero-temperature gap of this excitation. These features are\nmulti-triplet bound states, which develop particularly strongly near the\nquantum phase transition, fall to particularly low energies there, and persist\nto all the way to infinite temperature. Our results offer valuable insight into\nthe physics of finite-temperature spectral functions in SrCu$_2$(BO$_3$)$_2$\nand many other highly frustrated spin systems.\n", "  We show that a massless canonical scalar field minimally coupled to general\nrelativity can become a tachyonic ghost at low energies around a background in\nwhich the scalar's gradient is spacelike. By performing a canonical\ntransformation we demonstrate that this low energy ghost can be recast, at the\nlevel of the action, in a form of a fluid that undergoes a Jeans-like\ninstability affecting only modes with large wavelength. This illustrates that\nlow-energy tachyonic ghosts do not lead to a catastrophic quantum vacuum\ninstability, unlike the usual high-energy ghost degrees of freedom.\n", "  Zhang et al. reported in [Phys. Rev. B 77, 241402(R) (2008)] a theoretical\nstudy of the optical spectra of monolayer graphene employing the Kubo formula\nwithin a tight-binding model. Their calculations predicted that at high\nfrequencies the optical conductivity of graphene becomes strongly anisotropic.\nIn particular, at frequencies comparable to the energy separation of the upper\nand lower bands at the $\\Gamma$-point, the optical conductivity is strongly\nsuppressed if the field polarization is along the zigzag direction while it is\nsignificantly high for the armchair one. We find that, unfortunately, this\nresult is just a consequence of the incorrect determination of the current\noperator in k-space. Here, we present the standard scheme to obtain this\noperator correctly. As a result, we show that the optical conductivity of\nmonolayer graphene is indeed isotropic, which is consistent with the results of\nother (both theoretical and experimental) studies in the literature.\n", "  We study the crossover between the diffusive and quasi-ballistic regimes of\nrandom lasers. In particular, we compare incoherent models based on the\ndiffusion equation and the radiative transfer equation (RTE), which neglect all\nwave effects, with a coherent wave model for the random laser threshold. We\nshow that both the incoherent and the coherent models predict qualitatively\nsimilar thresholds, with a smooth transition from a diffuse to a\nquasi-ballistic regime. The shape of the intensity distribution in the sample\nas predicted by the RTE model at threshold is also in good agreement with the\ncoherent model. The approximate incoherent models thus provide useful\nanalytical predictions for the threshold of random lasers as well as the shape\nof the random laser modes at threshold.\n", "  Heat flux exchanged between two hot bodies at subwavelength separation\ndistances can exceed the limit predicted by the blackbody theory. However this\nsuper-Planckian transfer is restricted to these separation distances. Here we\ndemonstrate the possible existence of a super-Planckian transfer at arbitrary\nlarge separation distances if the interacting bodies are connected in\nnear-field with weakly dissipating hyperbolic waveguides. This result opens the\nway to long distance transport of near-field thermal energy.\n", "  Proposals for superconductivity emerging from correlated electrons in the\ndoped Hubbard model on the honeycomb lattice range from chiral $d+id$ singlet\nto $p+ip$ triplet pairing, depending on the considered range of doping and\ninteraction strength, as well as the approach used to analyze the pairing\ninstabilities. Here, we consider these scenarios using large-scale dynamic\ncluster approximation (DCA) calculations to examine the evolution in the\nleading pairing symmetry from weak to intermediate coupling strength. These\ncalculations focus on doping levels around the van Hove singularity (VHS) and\nare performed using DCA simulations with an interaction-expansion\ncontinuous-time quantum Monte Carlo cluster solver. We calculated explicitly\nthe temperature dependence of different uniform superconducting pairing\nsusceptibilities and found a consistent picture emerging upon gradually\nincreasing the cluster size: while at weak coupling the $d+id$ singlet pairing\ndominates close to the VHS filling, an enhanced tendency towards $p$-wave\ntriplet pairing upon further increasing the interaction strength is observed.\nThe relevance of these systematic results for existing proposals and ongoing\npursuits of odd-parity topological superconductivity are also discussed.\n", "  In the studies of iron-pnictides, a key question is whether their bad-metal\nstate from which the superconductivity emerges lies in close proximity with a\nmagnetically ordered insulating phase. Recently it was found that at low\ntemperatures, the heavily Cu-doped NaFe$_{1-x}$Cu$_x$As ($x > 0.3$)\niron-pnictide is an insulator with long-range antiferromagnetic order, similar\nto the parent compound of cuprates but distinct from all other iron-pnictides.\nUsing angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we determined the\nmomentum-resolved electronic structure of NaFe$_{1-x}$Cu$_x$As ($x = 0.44$) and\nidentified that its ground state is a narrow-gap insulator. Combining the\nexperimental results with density functional theory (DFT) and DFT+U\ncalculations, our analysis reveals that the on-site Coulombic (Hubbard) and\nHund's coupling energies play crucial roles in formation of the band gap about\nthe chemical potential. We propose that at finite temperatures charge carriers\nare thermally excited from the Cu-As-like valence band into the conduction\nband, which is of Fe $3d$-like character. With increasing temperature, the\nnumber of electrons in the conduction band becomes larger and the hopping\nenergy between Fe sites increases, and finally the long-range antiferromagnetic\norder is destroyed at $T > T_\\mathrm{N}$. Our study provides a basis for\ninvestigating the evolution of the electronic structure of a Mott insulator\ntransforming into a bad metallic phase, and eventually forming a\nsuperconducting state in iron-pnictidesa superconducting state in\niron-pnictides.\n", "  We present an existence and stability theory for gravity-capillary solitary\nwaves on the top surface of and interface between two perfect fluids of\ndifferent densities, the lower one being of infinite depth. Exploiting a\nclassical variational principle, we prove the existence of a minimiser of the\nwave energy $\\mathcal{E}$ subject to the constraint $\\mathcal{I}=2\\mu$, where\n$\\mathcal{I}$ is the wave momentum and $0< \\mu < \\mu_0$, where $\\mu_0$ is\nchosen small enough for the validity of our calculations. Since $\\mathcal{E}$\nand $\\mathcal{I}$ are both conserved quantities a standard argument asserts the\nstability of the set $D_\\mu$ of minimisers: solutions starting near $D_\\mu$\nremain close to $D_\\mu$ in a suitably defined energy space over their interval\nof existence. The solitary waves which we construct are of small amplitude and\nare to leading order described by the cubic nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation.\nThey exist in a parameter region in which the `slow' branch of the dispersion\nrelation has a strict non-degenerate global minimum and the corresponding\nnonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation is of focussing type. We show that the waves\ndetected by our variational method converge (after an appropriate rescaling) to\nsolutions of the model equation as $\\mu \\downarrow 0$.\n", "  We have measured the thermal resistances of thin films of the small molecule\norganic semiconductors bis(triisopropylsilylethynyl) pentacene (TIPS-pn),\nbis(triethylsilylethynyl) anthradithiophene (TES-ADT) and difluoro\nbis(triethylsilylethynyl) anthradithiophene (diF-TES-ADT). For each material,\nseveral films of different thicknesses have been measured to separate the\neffects of intrinsic thermal conductivity from interface thermal resistance.\nFor non-crystalline films of all three materials, with thicknesses ranging from\n< 100 nm to > 4 microns, the thermal conductivities are similar to that of\npolymers and over an order of magnitude smaller than that of the crystals,\nreflecting the large reduction in phonon mean-free path in the films. Thin (<\n205 nm) crystalline films of TES-ADT, prepared by vapor-annealing spin-cast\nfilms, have also been measured, but for these the thermal resistances are\ndominated by interface scattering.\n", "  Despite more than 40 years of research in condensed-matter physics,\nstate-of-the-art approaches for simulating the radial distribution function\n(RDF) g(r) still rely on binning pair-separations into a histogram. Such\nmethods suffer from undesirable properties, including subjectivity, high\nuncertainty, and slow rates of convergence. Moreover, such problems go\nundetected by the metrics often used to assess RDFs. To address these issues,\nwe propose (I) a spectral Monte Carlo (SMC) method that yields g(r) as an\nanalytical series expansion; and (II) a Sobolev norm that assesses the quality\nof RDFs by quantifying their fluctuations. Using the latter, we show that,\nrelative to histogram-based approaches, SMC reduces by orders of magnitude both\nthe noise in g(r) and the number of pair separations needed for acceptable\nconvergence. Moreover, SMC reduces subjectivity and yields simple,\ndifferentiable formulas for the RDF, which are useful for tasks such as\ncoarse-grained force-field calibration via iterative Boltzmann inversion.\n", "  Planar zeros are studied in the context of the five-point scattering\namplitude for gauge bosons and gravitons. In the case of gauge theories, it is\nfound that planar zeros are determined by an algebraic curve in the projective\nplane spanned by the three stereographic coordinates labelling the direction of\nthe outgoing momenta. This curve depends on the values of six independent color\nstructures. Considering the gauge group SU(N) with N=2,3,5 and fixed color\nindices, the class of curves obtained gets broader by increasing the rank of\nthe group. For the five-graviton scattering, on the other hand, we show that\nthe amplitude vanishes whenever the process is planar, without imposing further\nkinematic conditions. A rationale for this result is provided using\ncolor-kinematics duality.\n", "  Atomically thin NbSe2 is a metallic layered transition metal dichalcogenide\n(TMD) with considerably different crystallographic structure and electronic\nproperties from other TMDs, such as MoS2, MoSe2, WS2 and WSe2. Properties of\nTMD atomic layers are sensitive to interlayer coupling. Here we investigate the\ninterlayer phonons of few-layer NbSe2 by ultralow-frequency Raman spectroscopy.\nWe observe both the interlayer breathing modes and shear modes at frequencies\nbelow 40 cm-1 for samples of 2 to 15 layers. Their frequency, Raman activity,\nand environmental instability depend systematically on the layer number. We\naccount for these results utilizing a combination of the linear-chain model,\ngroup-theory analysis and first-principles calculations. Although NbSe2\npossesses different stacking order from MoS2, MoSe2, WS2 and WSe2, it exhibits\nthe same symmetry and Raman selection rules, as well as similar interlayer\ncoupling strength and thickness dependence of interlayer phonon modes.\n", "  The physics of light interference experiments is well established for nematic\nliquid crystals. Using well-known techniques, it is possible to obtain\nimportant quantities, such as the differential scattering cross section and the\nsaddl-splay elastic constant $K_{24}$. However, the usual methods to retrieve\nthe latter involves an adjusting of computational parameters through the visual\ncomparisons between the experimental light interference pattern or a\n$^{2}H-NMR$ spectral pattern produced by an escaped-radial disclination, and\ntheir computational simulation counterparts. To avoid such comparisons, we\ndevelop an algebraic method for obtaining of saddle-splay elastic constant\n$K_{24}$. Considering an escaped-radial disclination inside a capillary tube\nwith radius $R_{0}$ of tens of micrometers, we use a metric approach to study\nthe propagation of the light (in the scalar wave approximation), near to the\nsurface of the tube and to determine the light interference pattern due to the\ndefect. The latter is responsible for the existence of a well-defined\ninterference peak associated to a unique angle $\\phi_{0}$. Since this angle\ndepends on factors such as refractive indexes, curvature elastic constants,\nanchoring regime, surface anchoring strength and radius $R_{0}$, the\nmeasurement of $\\phi_{0}$ from the interference experiments involving two\ndifferent radii allows us to algebraically retrieve $K_{24}$. Our method\nallowed us to give the first reported estimation of $K_{24}$ for the lyotropic\nchromonic liquid crystal Sunset Yellow FCF: $K_{24}=2.1\\ pN$.\n", "  Modeling the luminous mass components of spiral galaxies in standard gravity\nposes a challenge due to the missing mass problem. However, with the addition\nof cold dark matter, the missing mass problem can be circumvented at the cost\nof additional free parameters to the theory. The Luminous Convolution Model\n(LCM) reconsiders how we interpret rotation curve data, such that\nDoppler-shifted spectra measurements can constrain luminous mass discovery. For\na sample of 25 galaxies of varying morphologies and sizes, we demonstrate an\nansatz for relative galaxy curvatures that can explain the missing mass. We\nsolve for the LCM free parameter, which we report as a ratio of radial\ndensities of the emitter, to receiver galaxy baryonic mass, to an exponent of\n$1.63$. Here, we show that this exponent is sensitive to which Milky Way\nluminous mass model one chooses. We then make a first prediction regarding the\nMilky Way mass profile in the inner one kpc.\n  Thus, with a bound on the LCM free parameter, we pave the way for future\nwork, where the LCM will tested as a zero-parameter model to predict luminous\nmass from rotation curve data.\n", "  CppTransport is a numerical platform that can automatically generate and\nsolve the evolution equations for the 2- and 3-point correlation functions (in\nfield space and for the curvature perturbation) for any inflationary model with\ncanonical kinetic terms. It makes no approximations beyond the applicability of\ntree-level perturbation theory. Given an input Lagrangian, CppTransport\nperforms symbolic calculations to determine the 'Feynman rules' of the model\nand generates efficient C++ to integrate the correlation functions of interest.\nIt includes a visualization suite that automates extraction of observable\nquantities from the raw n-point functions and generates high quality plots with\nminimal manual intervention. It is intended to be used as a collaborative\nplatform, promoting the rapid investigation of models and systematizing their\ncomparison with observation. This guide describes how to install and use the\nsystem, and illustrates its use through some simple examples.\n", "  Recently, in [P. Jizba and J. Korbel, Physica A 444, 2016, 808-827], four\ngeneralized Shannon-Khinchin [GSK] axioms have been proposed and a generalized\nentropy which uniquely satisfies the GSK axioms has been derived. In this\ncomment, we show that the unique class of the entropies derived in the\naforementioned paper is not correct, as it violates the fourth GSK axiom, and\nwe derive the correct one. Nevertheless, the class of entropies proposed in the\ncommented paper still can serve as a basis for generalized statistical\nmechanics. We propose a new axiomatic system which characterizes the class of\nentropies.\n", "  Here we demonstrate that a term in the nuclear spin Hamiltonian, the\nantisymmetric \\textit{J}-coupling, is fundamentally connected to molecular\nchirality. We propose and simulate a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)\nexperiment to observe this interaction and differentiate between enantiomers\nwithout adding any additional chiral agent to the sample. The antisymmetric\n\\textit{J}-coupling may be observed in the presence of molecular orientation by\nan external electric field. The opposite parity of the antisymmetric coupling\ntensor and the molecular electric dipole moment yields a sign change of the\nobserved coupling between enantiomers. We show how this sign change influences\nthe phase of the NMR spectrum and may be used to discriminate between\nenantiomers.\n", "  We conjecture that all connected graphs of order $n$ have von Neumann entropy\nat least as great as the star $K_{1,n-1}$ and prove this for almost all graphs\nof order $n$. We show that connected graphs of order $n$ have R\\'enyi 2-entropy\nat least as great as $K_{1,n-1}$ and for $\\alpha>1$, $K_n$ maximizes R\\'enyi\n$\\alpha$-entropy over graphs of order $n$. We show that adding an edge to a\ngraph can lower its von Neumann entropy.\n", "  The nonlinear magneto-optical effect has significantly impacted modern\nsociety with prolific applications ranging from precision mapping of the\nEarth's magnetic field to bio-magnetic sensing. Pioneering works on collisional\nspin-exchange effects have led to ultra-high magnetic field detection\nsensitivities at the level of $fT/\\sqrt{Hz}$ using a single linearly-polarized\nprobe light field. Here we demonstrate a nonlinear Zeeman-coherence parametric\nwave-mixing optical-atomic magnetometer using room temperature rubidium vapor\nthat results in more than a three-order-of-magnitude optical signal-to-noise\nratio (SNR) enhancement for extremely weak magnetic field sensing. This\nunprecedented enhancement was achieved with nearly a two-order-of-magnitude\nreduction in laser power while preserving the sensitivity of the widely-used\nsingle-probe beam optical-atomic magnetometry method. This new method opens a\nmyriad of applications ranging from bio-magnetic imaging to precision\nmeasurement of the magnetic properties of subatomic particles.\n", "  In this paper, we analysis the counter-term for the general relativity in the\nPalatini framework. The expression is valid for both the null boundary and\nnon-null boundary. We show that final results coincide with that in\nRef.\\cite{pad1} which starts form the Einstein-Hilbert action.\n", "  A message of any sort can be regarded as a source of information. Claude. E.\nShannon showed in the last century that information (\"what we don't already\nknow\") is equivalent to the entropy as defined in statistical mechanics. A\nstring of experimental observations is like a succession of words; they both\nconvey information and can be characterized by their entropy. For the fluid\nflow measurements and simulations to be discussed here (pipe and soap film\nflow, GOY model), the entropy depends on controllable parameters such as the\nReynolds number. The information theory approach is applicable to measurements\nof any type including those governed by intractable equations or systems where\nthe governing equations are not known. This contribution is dedicated to the\nmemory of Leo Kadanoff, an inspiring teacher and one of the most important\nscientific leaders of the last half century.\n", "  Ammonium DiNitramide (ADN) is one of the most promising green energetic\noxidizers for future rocket propellant formulations. In the present work, we\nreport a detailed theoretical study on structural, elastic, and vibrational\nproperties of the emerging oxidizer under hydrostatic compression using various\ndispersion correction methods to capture weak intermolecular (van der Waals and\nhydrogen bonding) interactions. The calculated ground state lattice parameters,\naxial compressibilities, and equation of state are in good accord with the\navailable experimental results. Strength of intermolecular interactions has\nbeen correlated using the calculated compressibility curves and elastic moduli.\nApart from this, we also observe discontinuities in the structural parameters\nand elastic constants as a function of pressure. Pictorial representation and\nquantification of intermolecular interactions are described by the 3D Hirshfeld\nsurfaces and 2D finger print maps. In addition, the computed infra-red (IR)\nspectra at ambient pressure reveal that ADN is found to have more hygroscopic\nnature over Ammonium Perchlorate (AP) due to the presence of strong hydrogen\nbonding. Pressure dependent IR spectra show blue- and red-shift of bending and\nstretching frequencies which leads to weakening and strengthening of the\nhydrogen bonding below and above 5 GPa, respectively. The abrupt changes in the\ncalculated structural, mechanical, and IR spectra suggest that ADN might\nundergo a first order structural transformation to a high pressure phase around\n5-6 GPa. From the predicted detonation properties, ADN is found to have high\nand low performance characteristics when compared with ammonium based energetic\noxidizers and well-known secondary explosives, respectively.\n", "  We report the structural, elastic and vibrational properties of five\nionic-molecular solid oxidizers MNO$_3$ (M = Li, Na, K) and MClO$_3$ (M = Na,\nK). By treating long range electron-correlation effects, dispersion corrected\nmethod leads to more accurate predictions of structural properties and phase\nstability of KNO$_3$ polymorphs. The obtained elastic moduli show soft nature\nof these materials and are consistent with Ultrasonic Pulse Echo measurements.\nWe made a complete assignment of vibrational modes which are in good accord\nwith available experimental results. From calculated IR and Raman spectra, it\nis found that the vibrational frequencies show a red-shift from Li -> Na -> K\n(Na -> K) and N -> Cl for nitrates (chlorates) due to increase in mass of metal\nand non-metal atoms, respectively. The calculated electronic structure using\nrecently developed Tran-Blaha modified Becke-Johnson potential show that the\nmaterials are wide band gap insulators with predominant ionic bonding between\nM$^+$ (metal) and NO$_3^-$ /ClO$_3^-$ ions and covalent bonding (N-O and Cl-O)\nwithin nitrate and chlorate anionic group. From the calculated optical spectra,\nwe observe that electric-dipole transitions are due to nitrate/chlorate group\nbelow 20 eV and cationic transitions occur above 20 eV. The calculated\nreflectivity spectra are consistent with the available experimental spectra.\n", "  We consider the creation of artificial gauge magnetic and electric fields\ncreated when a two-level atom interacts with an optical Ferris wheel light\nfield.These fields have the spatial structure of the optical Ferris wheel field\nintensity profile. If this optical field pattern is made to rotate in space\nthen we have the creation of artificial electromagnetic fields which propagate\nin closed paths. The properties of such fields are presented and discussed\n", "  Intra Landau level thermal activation, from localized states in the tail, to\ndelocalized states above the mobility edge in the same Landau level, explains\nthe $B_c(T)$ (half width of the dissipationless state) phase diagram for a\nnumber of different quantum Hall samples with widely ranging carrier density,\nmobility and disorder. Good agreement is achieved over $2-3$ orders of\nmagnitude in temperature and magnetic field for a wide range of filling\nfactors. The Landau level width is found to be independent of magnetic field.\nThe mobility edge moves, in the case of changing Landau level overlap to\nmaintain a sample dependent critical density of states at that energy. An\nanalysis of filling factor $\\nu=2/3$ shows that the composite Fermion Landau\nlevels have exactly the same width as their electron counterparts. An important\ningredient of the model is the Lorentzian broadening with long tails which\nprovide localized states deep in the gap which are essential in order to\nreproduce the robust high temperature $B_c(T)$ phase observed in experiment.\n", "  It has recently been shown that the Jarzynski equality gets modified, when\nthere are experimental errors in computing work. This modified result also\nholds good in presence of feedback. In this work, we use a simple toy model,\nthat of a Szilard engine, to prove these results both in the presence and in\nabsence of feedback.\n", "  We have selected a set of 17 visual binaries that demonstrate great\ninconsistency between the systemic mass obtained through Kepler's Third Law as\ncompared to that calculated through standard mass-luminosity and mass-spectrum\nrelationships. A careful inspection of orbital data and parallaxes showed that\nthe current orbits of nine binaries (WDS 00155-1608, WDS 00174+0853, WDS\n05017+2050, WDS 06410+0954, WDS 16212-2536, WDS 17336-3706, WDS 19217-1557, WDS\n20312+1116, and WDS 21118+5959) do not need to be improved, instead we\nrecommend different parallax (distance) value for them. On the other hand, we\nconsidered that eight orbits (WDS 02366+1227, WDS 02434-6643, WDS 03244-1539,\nWDS 08507+1800, WDS 09128-6055, WDS 11532-1540, WDS 17375+2419, and WDS\n22408-0333) had to be improved. Due to various reasons mentioned in this paper,\ntheir distances should most likely be corrected unless better orbital solutions\nand/or more precise parallaxes are reported. To obtain consistent mass values,\nthe use of the dynamical parallax is still recommended for 5 out of the 8\nimproved orbits. For WDS 02434-6643, WDS 09128-6055, and WDS 11532-1540, the\nimprovement itself yields reasonable mass sums while maintaining {\\pi}_{Hip}\nwithin a 1-2{\\sigma} margin. New distance estimates for 16 stars (mainly based\non the obtained dynamical parallaxes) and individual comments for all objects\nare presented and discussed.\n", "  We present an algebraic, nondiagrammatic derivation of finite-temperature\nsecond-order many-body perturbation theory [FT-MBPT(2)], using techniques and\nconcepts accessible to theoretical chemical physicists. We give explicit\nexpressions not just for the grand potential but particularly for the mean\nenergy of an interacting many-electron system. The framework presented is\nsuitable for computing the energy of a finite or infinite system in contact\nwith a heat and particle bath at finite temperature and chemical potential.\nFT-MBPT(2) may be applied if the system, at zero temperature, may be described\nusing standard (i.e., zero-temperature) second-order many-body perturbation\ntheory [ZT-MBPT(2)] for the energy. We point out that in such a situation,\nFT-MBPT(2) reproduces, in the zero-temperature limit, the energy computed\nwithin ZT-MBPT(2). In other words, the difficulty that has been referred to as\nthe Kohn--Luttinger conundrum, does not occur. We comment, in this context, on\na \"renormalization\" scheme recently proposed by Hirata and He.\n", "  The numerical simulation of the nonlinear dynamics of random sea waves at\nmoderately small Benjamin-Feir indices and its comparison with the linear\ndynamics (at the coincidence of spatial Fourier harmonics near a spectral peak\nat a certain time $t_p$) indicate that the appearance of a rogue wave can be\npredicted in advance. If the linear approximation shows the presence of a\nsufficiently extensive and/or high group of waves in the near future after\n$t_p$, an anomalous wave is almost necessarily formed in the nonlinear model.\nThe interval of reliable forecasting covers several hundred wave periods, which\ncan be quite sufficient in practice for, e.g., avoiding the meeting of a ship\nwith a giant wave.\n", "  In laboratory experiments, we studied collisions of ensembles of compact\n(filling factor 0.33) millimeter dust aggregates composed of micrometer quartz\ngrains. We used cylindrical aggregates, triangular aggregates, square\naggregates, and rectangular aggregates. Ensembles of equal size aggregates as\nwell as ensembles with embedded larger aggregates were studied. The typical\ncollision velocities are 10-20 mm $\\rm s^{-1}$. High spatial and temporal\nresolution imaging unambiguously shows that individual collisions lead to\nsticking with a high probability of 20 percent. This leads to connected\nclusters of aggregates. The contact areas between two aggregates increase with\ncollision velocity. However, this cluster growth is only temporary, as\nsubsequent collisions of aggregates and clusters eventually lead to the\ndetachment of all aggregates from a cluster. The contacts are very fragile as\naggregates cannot be compressed further or fragment under our experimental\nconditions to enhance the contact stability. Therefore, the evolution of the\nensemble always leads back to a distribution of individual aggregates of\ninitial size. This supports and extends earlier experiments showing that a\nbouncing barrier in planetesimal formation would be robust against shape and\nsize variations.\n", "  A detailed study of the high-pressure structural properties, lattice dynamics\nand band structures of perovskite structured fluorides KZnF3, CsCaF3 and BaLiF3\nhas been carried out by means of density functional theory. The calculated\nstructural properties including elastic constants and equation of state agree\nwell with available experimental information. The phonon dispersion curves are\nin good agreement with available experimental inelastic neutron scattering\ndata. The electronic structures of these fluorides have been calculated using\nthe quasi particle self-consistent [Formula: see text] approximation. The\n[Formula: see text] calculations reveal that all the fluorides studied are wide\nband gap insulators, and the band gaps are significantly larger than those\nobtained by the standard local density approximation, thus emphasizing the\nimportance of quasi particle corrections in perovskite fluorides.\n", "  We construct directed and weighted climate networks based on near surface air\ntemperature to investigate the global impacts of El Nino and La Nina. We find\nthat regions which are characterized by higher positive or negative network in\nweighted links, are exhibiting stronger correlations with the El Nino basin and\nare warmer or cooler during El Nino or La Nina periods. These stronger\nin-weighted activities are found to be concentrated in localized areas, as\ncompared to non-El Nino periods, whereas a large fraction of the globe is not\ninfluenced by the events. The regions of localized activity vary from one El\nNino (La Nina) event to another; still some El Nino (La Nina) events are more\nsimilar to each other. We quantify this similarity using network community\nstructure. The results and methodology reported here may be used to improve the\nunderstanding and prediction of El Nino or La Nina events and also may be\napplied in the investigation of other climate variables.\n", "  In previous works we predicted the existence of a $\\bar b \\bar b u d$\ntetraquark with quantum numbers $I(J^P) = 0(1^+)$ using the static\napproximation for the $\\bar b$ quarks and neglecting heavy spin effects. Since\nthe binding energy is of the same order as expected for these heavy spin\neffects, it is essential to include them in the computation. Here we present a\ncorresponding method and show evidence that binding is only slightly weakened\nand that the $\\bar b \\bar b u d$ tetraquark persists.\n", "  Spatial profiles of the pressure have been measured in atomic Fermi gases\nwith primarily 2D kinematics. The in-plane motion of the particles is confined\nby a gaussian-shape potential. The two-component deeply-degenerate Fermi gases\nare prepared at different values of the s-wave attraction. The pressure profile\nis found using the force-balance equation, from the measured density profile\nand the trapping potential. The pressure is compared to zero-temperature models\nwithin the local density approximation. In the weakly-interacting regime, the\npressure lies above a Landau Fermi-liquid theory and below the ideal-Fermi-gas\nmodel, whose prediction coincides with that of the Cooper-pair mean-field\ntheory. The values closest to the data are provided by the approach where the\nmean-field of Cooper pairs is supplemented with fluctuations. In the regime of\nstrong interactions, in response to the increasing attraction, the pressure\nshifts below this model reaching lower values calculated within Monte Carlo\nmethods. Comparison to models shows that interaction-induced departure from 2D\nkinematics is either small or absent. In particular, comparison with a lattice\nMonte Carlo suggests that kinematics is 2D in the strongly-interacting regime.\n", "  It was shown in [PRL 114, 138301 (2015)] that a remarkably simple dynamical\nmodel exhibits many of the complex flow regimes and non-equilibrium phase\ntransitions characteristic of complex fluids. By removing extraneous detail,\nthis simplest microscopic model of non-Newtonian flow can reveal the universal\nphysics relevant to all complex fluids. Here we present more detailed results\nand a full derivation of the model's compact mean-field constitutive relation,\nwith great potential scope for insights into universality and tractable\nmathematics. By enforcing local conservation of angular momentum, the\none-dimensional (1D) XY-model (originally used for equilibrium magnetic\nsystems) can be driven into various flow regimes, including simple Newtonian\nbehaviour, shear banding, solid-liquid coexistence and slip-plane motion. The\nmodel demonstrates that the phenomenon of shear banding does not rely on\ndetails of tensorial stress fields, but can exist in 1D.\n", "  In this note we summarize our recent results for the temperature dependence\nof transport coefficients of metallic films in the presence of spin-orbit\ncoupling. Our focus is on (i) the spin Nernst and the thermal Edelstein\neffects, and (ii) the phonon skew scattering contribution to the spin Hall\nconductivity, which is relevant for the temperature dependence of the spin Hall\nangle. Depending on the parameters, the latter is expected to show a\nnon-monotonous behavior.\n", "  The function to measure orbital angular momentum (OAM) distribution of vortex\nlight is essential for OAM applications. Although there are lots of works to\nmeasure OAM modes, it is difficult to measure the power distribution of\ndifferent OAM modes quantitatively and instantaneously, let alone measure the\nphase distribution among them. In this work, we demonstrate an OAM complex\nspectrum analyzer, which enables to measure the power and phase distribution of\nOAM modes simultaneously by employing rotational Doppler Effect. The original\nOAM mode distribution is mapped to electrical spectrum of beating signals with\na photodetector. The power distribution and phase distribution of superimposed\nOAM beams are successfully retrieved by analyzing the electrical spectrum. We\nalso extend the measurement to other spatial modes, such as linear polarization\nmodes. These results represent a new landmark of spatial mode analysis and show\ngreat potentials in optical communication and OAM quantum state tomography.\n", "  The differences between the oscillation frequencies and uncertainty estimates\nof a star derived by different fitters can be large, sufficiently large so\nthat, were one to find a stellar model that fitted one frequency set\n($\\chi^2\\sim 1$), it does not fit an alternative set. I give 21 examples,\ncomparing frequency sets in common between the Kepler Legacy project and\nfrequency sets from Appourchaux et al (2014) and Davies et al (2015). For\n16CygA&B the differences are large; the $\\chi^2$ of the fit of Legacy to\nDavies's values ranging from 1.64 to 11.47 for 16CygA and 1.62 to 1.79 for\n16CygB, depending on which error estimates are used. I analyse both stars in\nsome detail applying my own mode fitting code to both the Legacy and Davies's\npower spectra and find reasonable agreement with Davies's full frequency sets\nand very good agreement between values for modes with signal/noise > 1 ($\\chi^2\n= 0.06, \\chi^2_B=0.03$). But the difference with the Legacy values remains\nlarge even for modes with S/N>1. I also examine the effects of different power\nspectra (weighted and unweighted) using the kasoc light curves for Q6-17.2 and\nQ7-Q16, the effect of different mode height ratios and different rotational\nsplitting and inclination.\n", "  In this work, we study seismic wave amplification in alluvial basins having\n3D standard geometries through the Fast Multipole Boundary Element Method in\nthe frequency domain. We investigate how much 3D amplification differs from the\n1D (horizontal layering) case. Considering incident fields of plane harmonic\nwaves, we examine the relationships between the amplification level and the\nmost relevant physical parameters of the problem (impedance contrast, 3D aspect\nratio, vertical and oblique incidence of plane waves). The FMBEM results show\nthat the most important parameters for wave amplification are the impedance\ncontrast and the so-called equivalent shape ratio. Using these two parameters,\nwe derive simple rules to compute the fundamental frequency for various 3D\nbasin shapes and the corresponding 3D/1D amplification factor for 5% damping.\nEffects on amplification due to 3D basin asymmetry are also studied and\nincorporated in the derived rules.\n", "  When injecting CO2 or other fluids into a geological formation, pressure\nplays an important role both as a driver of flow and as a risk factor for\nmechanical integrity.\n  The full effect of geomechanics on aquifer flow can only be captured using a\ncoupled flow-geomechanics model. In order to solve this computationally\nexpensive system, various strategies have been put forwards over the years,\nwith some of the best current methods based on sequential splitting.\n  In the present work, we seek to approximate the full geomechanical effect on\nflow without the need of coupling with a geomechanics solver during simulation,\nand at a computational cost comparable to that of an uncoupled model. We do\nthis by means of precomputed pressure response functions. At grid model\ngeneration time, a geomechanics solver is used to compute the mechanical\nresponse of the aquifer for a set of pressure fields. The relevant information\nfrom these responses is then stored in a compact form and embedded with the\ngrid model.\n  We test the accuracy and computational performance of our approach on a\nsimple 2D and a more complex 3D model, and compare the results with those\nproduced by a fully coupled approach as well as from a simple decoupled method\nbased on Geertsma's uniaxial expansion coefficient.\n", "  The internal rotation of low mass stars all along their evolution is of\nprimary interest when studying their rotational dynamics, internal mixing and\nmagnetic fields generation. In this context, helio- and asteroseismology probe\nangular velocity gradients deep within solar type stars. Still the rotation of\nthe close center of such stars on the main sequence is hardly detectable and\nthe dynamical interactions of the radiative core with the surface convective\nenvelope is not well understood. Among them, the influence of the differential\nrotation profile sustained by convection and applied as a boundary condition to\nthe radiation zone may be very important leading to the formation of\ntachoclines. In the solar convective region, the equator is rotating faster\nthan the pole while numerical simulations predict either a solar or an\nanti-solar rotation in other low mass stars envelopes depending on their\nconvective Rossby number. In this work, we therefore build for the first time\n2D steady hydrodynamical models of low mass stars radiation zone providing a\nfull 2D description of their dynamics and studying the influence of a general\nshear boundary condition accounting for a solar or an anti-solar differential\nrotation in the convective envelope. We compute coherently differential\nrotation and the associated meridional circulation using the Boussinesq\napproximation.\n", "  It has been shown previously for electrodeposited Co/Cu multilayers that the\nsingle-bath electrodeposition process can be optimized from an electrochemical\npoint of view in order to avoid unwanted Co dissolution and incorporation of Co\nin the non-magnetic layer during the Cu deposition pulse. In the present work,\nelectrodeposition of Ni-Co/Cu multilayers has been studied to clarify if the\nsame optimization method is appropriate when two magnetic elements are present\nand if this potential results in the largest giant magnetoresistance (GMR) for\nthe particular alloy system studied. For this purpose, several Ni-Co/Cu\nmultilayers were prepared by varying the deposition potential of the Cu layer.\nThe composition analysis of the deposits showed that the Ni:Co ratio exhibits a\nminimum as a function of the Cu deposition potential, which can be explained by\nconsidering both the dissolution of Co and the mass transport of the reactants.\nBoth the saturation GMR value and the intensity of the satellite peaks in the\nX-ray diffractograms were highly correlated with the resulting surface\nroughness of the deposits which was strongly varying with the Cu deposition\npotential. Higher GMR values, lower saturation fields and more perfect\nmultilayer structure were observed for sufficiently positive Cu deposition\npotentials only which enabled a partial Co dissolution resulting in a reduced\nsurface roughness. The results draw attention to the complexity of the\noptimization procedure of the deposition of multilayers with several alloying\ncomponents.\n", "  We study the parton distribution of nucleon and nuclear EMC effect in a\nstatistical model. We find when we choose the parameters appropriately, the\npredictions given by pure statistical laws can fit the experimental data well\nin most range of $x$, this reveal statistical law play an important role in the\nparton distribution of nucleon.\n", "  The dispersion relation for magnetoplasmons in a planar superlattice with\nperiodically alternating regions of gapless and gapped modications of graphene\nhas been derived within the frame of the random-phase approximation. The\ncontribution of virtual transitions between the lower electron miniband and the\nupper hole miniband to the polarization operator has been taken into account in\naddition to the contribution of virtual intra-miniband transitions.\n", "  Experiments on the effects due solely to a mobile granular layer on a liquid\nflow are presented (feedback effect). Nonintrusive measurements were performed\nin a closed conduit channel of rectangular cross section where grains were\ntransported as bed load by a turbulent water flow. The water velocity profiles\nwere measured over fixed and mobile granular beds of same granulometry by\nParticle Image Velocimetry. The spatial resolution of the measurements allowed\nthe experimental quantification of the feedback effect. The present findings\nare of importance for predicting the bed-load transport rate and the pressure\ndrop in activities related to the conveyance of grains.\n", "  In this article we present Miuz, a robustness index for complex networks.\nMiuz measures the impact of disconnecting a node from the network while\ncomparing the sizes of the remaining connected components. Strictly speaking,\nMiuz for a node is defined as the inverse of the size of the largest connected\ncomponent divided by the sum of the sizes of the remaining ones. We tested our\nindex in attack strategies where the nodes are disconnected in decreasing order\nof a specified metric. We considered Miuz and other well-known centrality\nmeasures such as betweenness, degree , and harmonic centrality. All of these\nmetrics were compared regarding the behavior of the robust-ness (R-index)\nduring the attacks. In an attempt to simulate the internet backbone, the\nattacks were performed in complex networks with power-law degree distributions\n(scale-free networks). Preliminary results show that attacks based on\ndisconnecting a few number of nodes Miuz are more dangerous (decreasing the\nrobustness) than the same attacks based on other centrality measures. We\nbelieve that Miuz, as well as other measures based on the size of the largest\nconnected component, provides a good addition to other robustness metrics for\ncomplex networks.\n", "  The temperature evolution of GdFeCo electrons following optical heating plays\na key role in all optical switching of GdFeCo and is primarily governed by the\nstrength of coupling between electrons and phonons. Typically, the strength of\nelectron-phonon coupling in a metal is deduced by monitoring changes in\nreflectance following optical heating and then analyzing the transient\nreflectance with a simple two-temperature thermal model. In a magnetic metal,\nthe change in reflectance cannot be assumed to depend only the electron and\nphonon temperatures because a metal's reflectance also depends on the\nmagnetization. To deduce the electron-phonon coupling constant in GdFeCo, we\nanalyze thermal transport in Au and GdFeCo bilayers following optical heating\nof the GdFeCo electrons. We use the reflectance of the Au layer to monitor the\ntemperature evolution of the Au phonons. By interpreting the response of the\nbilayer to heating with a thermal model, we determine the electron-phonon\ncoupling constant in GdFeCo to be 6 x 10^17 W/(m^3-K) corresponding to an\nelectron-phonon relaxation time in GdFeCo of ~150 fs.\n", "  We determine the rate of escape from a potential well, and the diffusion\ncoefficient in a periodic potential, of a random walker that moves under the\ninfluence of the potential in between successive collisions with the heat bath.\nIn the overdamped limit, both the escape rate and the diffusion coefficient\ncoincide with those of a Langevin particle. Conversely, in the underdamped\nlimit the two dynamics have a different temperature dependence. In particular,\nat low temperature the random walk has a smaller escape rate, but a larger\ndiffusion coefficient.\n", "  Understanding and using natural processes for intelligent functionalities,\nreferred to as natural intelligence, has recently attracted interest from a\nvariety of fields, including post-silicon computing for artificial intelligence\nand decision making in the behavioural sciences. In a past study, we\nsuccessfully used the wave-particle duality of single photons to solve the\ntwo-armed bandit problem, which constitutes the foundation of reinforcement\nlearning and decision making. In this study, we propose and confirm a\nhierarchical architecture for single-photon-based reinforcement learning and\ndecision making that verifies the scalability of the principle. Specifically,\nthe four-armed bandit problem is solved given zero prior knowledge in a\ntwo-layer hierarchical architecture, where polarization is autonomously adapted\nin order to effect adequate decision making using single-photon measurements.\nIn the hierarchical structure, the notion of layer-dependent decisions emerges.\nThe optimal solutions in the coarse layer and in the fine layer, however,\nconflict with each other in some contradictive problems. We show that while\nwhat we call a tournament strategy resolves such contradictions, the\nprobabilistic nature of single photons allows for the direct location of the\noptimal solution even for contradictive problems, hence manifesting the\nexploration ability of single photons. This study provides insights into photon\nintelligence in hierarchical architectures for future artificial intelligence\nas well as the potential of natural processes for intelligent functionalities.\n", "  We theoretically investigate the transport properties of a\nnormal-insulator-superconductor (NIS) junction of silicene in the thin barrier\nlimit. Similar to graphene the tunneling conductance in such NIS structure\nexhibits an oscillatory behavior as a function of the strength of the barrier\nin the insulating region. However, unlike in graphene, the tunneling\nconductance in silicene can be controlled by an external electric field owing\nto its buckled structure. We also demonstrate the change in behavior of the\ntunneling conductance across the NIS junction as we change the chemical\npotential in the normal silicene region. In addition, at high doping levels in\nthe normal region, the period of oscillation of the tunneling conductance as a\nfunction of the barrier strength changes from $\\pi/2$ to $\\pi$ with the\nvariation of doping in the superconducting region of silicene.\n", "  We present a survey on the results on a particular coagulation-fragmentation\nmodel given by the Becker-D\\\"oring equations. For both the deterministic and\nstochastic versions, we include well-posedness, long-time behavior, convergence\nrate towards equilibrium, coarsening and relation to transport equations,\ntime-dependent properties, metastability and classical nucleation theory. All\nalong this survey, we highlight recent results and open questions.\n", "  We study the mechanical stability of a tunable high-finesse microcavity under\nambient conditions and investigate light-induced effects that can both suppress\nand excite mechanical fluctuations. As an enabling step, we demonstrate the\nultra-precise electronic stabilization of a microcavity. We then show that\nphotothermal mirror expansion can provide high-bandwidth feedback and improve\ncavity stability by almost two orders of magnitude. At high intracavity power,\nwe observe self-oscillations of mechanical resonances of the cavity. We explain\nthe observations by a dynamic photothermal instability, leading to parametric\ndriving of mechanical motion. For an optimized combination of electronic and\nphotothermal stabilization, we achieve a feedback bandwidth of $500\\,$kHz and a\nnoise level of $1.1 \\times 10^{-13}\\,$m rms.\n", "  The interest in MoS2 for radio-frequency (RF) application has recently\nincreased. However, little is known on the scaling behavior of transistors made\nfrom MoS2 for RF applications, which is important for establishing performance\nlimits for electronic circuits based on 2D semiconductors on flexible and rigid\nsubstrates. Here, we present a systematic study of top-gated trilayer MoS2 RF\ntransistors with gate lengths scaled down to 70 and 40 nm. In addition, by\nintroducing edge-contacted injection of electrons in trilayer MoS2 devices, we\ndecrease the contact resistance and as a result obtain the highest cutoff\nfrequency of 6 GHz before the de-embedding procedure and 25 GHz after the\nde-embedding procedure.\n", "  The concept of a space elevator dates back to Tsilokovsky, but they are not\ncommonly considered in near-term plans for space exploration, perhaps because a\nterrestrial elevator would not be possible without considerable improvements in\ntether material. A Lunar Space Elevator (LSE), however, can be built with\ncurrent technology using commercially available tether polymers. This paper\nconsiders missions leading to infrastructure capable of shortening the time,\nlowering the cost and enhancing the capabilities of robotic and human\nexplorers. These missions use planetary scale tethers, strings many thousands\nof kilometers long stabilized either by rotation or by gravitational gradients.\nThese systems promise major reduction in transport costs versus chemical\nrockets, in a rapid timeframe, for a modest investment. Science will thus\nbenefit as well as commercial activities.\n"]}
