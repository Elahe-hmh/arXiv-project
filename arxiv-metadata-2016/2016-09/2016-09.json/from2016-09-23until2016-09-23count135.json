We show both numerically and theoretically that there\nis a class of isotropic networks which are stiffer than any other isotropic\nnetwork with same density. The elastic moduli of these \\textit{stiffest elastic\nnetworks} are explicitly given. They constitute upper-bounds which compete or\nimprove the well-known Hashin-Shtrikman bounds. We provide a convenient set of\ncriteria (necessary and sufficient conditions) to identify these networks, and\nshow that their displacement field under uniform loading conditions is affine\ndown to the microscopic scale. Finally, examples of such networks with periodic\narrangement are presented, in both two and three dimensions.\n", "  The original cubic interaction terms for higher spin gauge fields in four\ndimensions and their reformulation using Fock space vertex operators is\nreviewed. As a new result, the complete list of all cubic vertex functions in\nD=4 is derived. It is observed, contrary to what would have been expected, that\nthe non-linear dynamical Poincar\\'e transformations do not restrict the cubic\ninteractions beyond what is required by kinematics. The role of the SU(1,1)\nalgebra of tracelessness constraints is clarified. It is shown that higher spin\nfields couple non-minimally to gravity at the cubic level in D=4 light-front\ndynamics. Based on a detailed analysis of the structure of the light-front\nPoincar\\'e algebra, the formalism is then generalized to all orders in the\ninteraction. The interacting theory, being a deformation of the free theory,\ntakes the form of a strongly homotopy Lie algebra. It is conjectured that the\nensuing recursive equations, if they can be explicitly solved, will encode all\ninteraction data into a denumerable set of functions of p+, the overall\ntransverse momentum structure being fixed already at the kinematical level.\n", "  In order to study the behaviour of discrete dynamical systems under adiabatic\ncyclic variations of their parameters, we consider discrete versions of\nadiabatically-rotated rotators. Paralleling the studies in continuous systems,\nwe generalize the concept of geometric phase to discrete dynamics and\ninvestigate its presence in these rotators. For the rotated sine circle map, we\ndemonstrate an analytical relationship between the geometric phase and the\nrotation number of the system. For the discrete version of the rotated rotator\nconsidered by Berry, the rotated standard map, we further explore this\nconnection as well as the role of the geometric phase at the onset of chaos.\nFurther into the chaotic regime, we show that the geometric phase is also\nrelated to the diffusive behaviour of the dynamical variables and the Lyapunov\nexponent.\n", "  In the Internet era the information overload and the challenge to detect\nquality content has raised the issue of how to rank both resources and users in\nonline communities. In this paper we develop a general ranking method that can\nsimultaneously evaluate users' reputation and objects' quality in an iterative\nprocedure, and that exploits the trust relationships and social acquaintances\nof users as an additional source of information. We test our method on two real\nonline communities, the EconoPhysics forum and the Last.fm music catalogue, and\ndetermine how different variants of the algorithm influence the resultant\nranking. We show the benefits of considering trust relationships, and define\nthe form of the algorithm better apt to common situations.\n", "  In the Internet era, online social media emerged as the main tool for sharing\nopinions and information among individuals. In this work we study an adaptive\nmodel of a social network where directed links connect users with similar\ntastes, and over which information propagates through social recommendation.\nAgent-based simulations of two different artificial settings for modeling user\ntastes are compared with patterns seen in real data, suggesting that users\ndiffering in their scope of interests is a more realistic assumption than users\ndiffering only in their particular interests. We further introduce an extensive\nset of similarity metrics based on users' past assessments, and evaluate their\nuse in the given social recommendation model with both artificial simulations\nand real data. Superior recommendation performance is observed for similarity\nmetrics that give preference to users with small scope---who thus act as\nselective filters in social recommendation.\n", "  Splotch is a rendering algorithm for exploration and visual discovery in\nparticle-based datasets coming from astronomical observations or numerical\nsimulations. The strengths of the approach are production of high quality\nimagery and support for very large-scale datasets through an effective mix of\nthe OpenMP and MPI parallel programming paradigms. This article reports our\nexperiences in re-designing Splotch for exploiting emerging HPC architectures\nnowadays increasingly populated with GPUs. A performance model is introduced\nfor data transfers, computations and memory access, to guide our re-factoring\nof Splotch. A number of parallelization issues are discussed, in particular\nrelating to race conditions and workload balancing, towards achieving optimal\nperformances. Our implementation was accomplished by using the CUDA programming\nparadigm. Our strategy is founded on novel schemes achieving optimized data\norganisation and classification of particles. We deploy a reference simulation\nto present performance results on acceleration gains and scalability. We\nfinally outline our vision for future work developments including possibilities\nfor further optimisations and exploitation of emerging technologies.\n", "  We establish the link between the thermodynamics and the quantum theory of\nblack hole horizons through the construction of the thermodynamic partition\nfunction, partly based on some physically plausible arguments, by beginning\nfrom the description of quantum states of the horizon, considering loop quantum\ngravity(LQG) as the underlying theory. Although, the effective\n`thermalized\\rq{} form of the partition function has been previously used in\nthe literature to study the effect of thermal fluctuations of the black hole\nhorizon, nonetheless the direct link to any existing quantum theory (which is\nhere taken to be LQG), especially a derivation of the partition function from\nthe quantum states of the horizon, appears to be hitherto absent. This work is\nan attempt to bridge this small, but essential, gap that appears to be present\nbetween the existing literature of quantum theory and thermodynamics of black\nholes. Further, it may be emphasized that this work is {\\it only} concerned\nwith the {\\it metric independent} approaches to black hole thermodynamics.\n", "  Progress in understanding star formation requires detailed observational\nconstraints on the initial conditions, i.e. dense clumps and cores in giant\nmolecular clouds that are on the verge of gravitational instability. Such\nstructures have been studied by their extinction of Near-Infrared (NIR) and,\nmore recently, Mid-Infrared (MIR) background light. It has been somewhat more\nof a surprise to find that there are regions that appear as dark shadows at\nFar-Infrared (FIR) wavelengths as long as $\\sim$100$\\mu m$. Here we develop\nanalysis methods of FIR images from Spitzer-MIPS and Herschel-PACS that allow\nquantitative measurements of cloud mass surface density, $\\Sigma$. The method\nbuilds upon that developed for MIR extinction mapping (MIREX) (Butler and Tan\n2012), in particular involving a search for independent saturated, i.e. very\nopaque, regions that allow measurement of the foreground intensity. We focus on\nthree massive starless core/clumps in IRDC G028.37+00.07, deriving mass surface\ndensity maps from 3.5 to 70$\\mu m$. A by-product of this analysis is\nmeasurement of the spectral energy distribution of the diffuse foreground\nemission. The lower opacity at 70$\\mu m$ allows us to probe to higher $\\Sigma$\nvalues, up to $\\sim1\\:{\\rm{g\\:cm}^{-2}}$ in the densest parts of the\ncore/clumps. Comparison of the $\\Sigma$ maps at different wavelengths\nconstrains the shape of the MIR-FIR dust opacity law in IRDCs. We find it is\nmost consistent with the thick ice mantle models of Ossenkopf and Henning\n(1994). There is tentative evidence for grain ice mantle growth as one goes\nfrom lower to higher $\\Sigma$ regions.\n", "  Nonlocal correlations are useful for device independent (DI) randomness\ncertification [Nature (London) {\\bf 464}, 1021 (2010)]. The advantage of this\nDI protocol over the conventional quantum protocol is that randomness can be\ncertified even when experimental apparatuses are not trusted. Quantum\nentanglement is the necessary physical source for the nonlocal correlation\nrequired for such DI task. However, nonlocality and entanglement are distinct\nconcepts. There exist entangled states which produce no nonlocal correlation\nand hence are not useful for the DI randomness certification task. Here we\nintroduce the measurement-device-independent randomness certification task\nwhere one has trusted quantum state preparation device but the measurement\ndevices are completely unspecified. Interestingly we show that there exist\nentangled states, with local description, that are useful resource in such task\nwhich otherwise are useless in corresponding DI scenario.\n", "  Lattice Quantum ChromoDynamics (QCD), and by extension its parent field,\nLattice Gauge Theory (LGT), make up a significant fraction of supercomputing\ncycles worldwide. As such, it would be irresponsible not to evaluate machines'\nsuitability for such applications. To this end, a benchmark has been developed\nto assess the performance of LGT applications on modern HPC platforms. Distinct\nfrom previous QCD-based benchmarks, this allows probing the behaviour of a\nvariety of theories, which allows varying the ratio of demands between on-node\ncomputations and inter-node communications. The results of testing this\nbenchmark on various recent HPC platforms are presented, and directions for\nfuture development are discussed.\n", "  Cooperation lies at the foundations of human societies, yet why people\ncooperate remains a conundrum. The issue, known as network reciprocity, of\nwhether population structure can foster cooperative behavior in social dilemmas\nhas been addressed by many, but theoretical studies have yielded contradictory\nresults so far---as the problem is very sensitive to how players adapt their\nstrategy. However, recent experiments with the prisoner's dilemma game played\non different networks have shown that humans do not consider neighbors' payoffs\nwhen making their decisions, and that the network structure does not influence\nthe final outcome. In this work we carry out an extensive analysis of different\nevolutionary dynamics for players' strategies, showing that the absence of\nnetwork reciprocity is a general feature of those dynamics that do not take\nneighbors' payoffs into account. Our results, together with experimental\nevidence, hint at how to properly model real people's behavior.\n", "  We show that every closed oriented smooth 4-manifold admits a complete\nsingular Poisson structure in each homotopy class of maps to the 2-sphere. The\nrank of this structure is 2 outside a small singularity set, which consists of\nfinitely many circles and isolated points. The Poisson bivector has rank 0 on\nthe singularities, where we give its local form explicitly.\n", "  In 1935, Albert Einstein and two colleagues, Boris Podolsky and Nathan Rosen\n(EPR) developed a thought experiment to demonstrate what they felt was a lack\nof completeness in quantum mechanics. EPR also postulated the existence of more\nfundamental theory where physical reality of any system would be completely\ndescribe by the variables/states of that fundamental theory. This variable is\ncommonly called hidden variable and the theory is called hidden variable theory\n(HVT). In 1964, John Bell proposed an empirically verifiable criterion to test\nfor the existence of these HVTs. He derived an inequality, which must be\nsatisfied by any theory that fulfill the conditions of locality and reality} He\nalso showed that quantum mechanics, as it violates this inequality, is\nincompatible with any local-realistic theory. Later it has been shown that\nBell's inequality can be derived from different set of assumptions and it also\nfind applications in useful information theoretic protocols. In this review we\nwill discuss various foundational as well as information theoretic implications\nof Bell's inequality. We will also discuss about some restricted nonlocal\nfeature of quantum nonlocality and elaborate the role of Uncertainty principle\nand Complementarity principle in explaining this feature.\n", "  We estimate the sensitivity of the upcoming CTA gamma-ray telescope to DM\nannihilation at the Galactic centre, improving on previous analyses in a number\nof significant ways. First, we perform a detailed analyses of all backgrounds,\nincluding diffuse astrophysical emission for the first time in a study of this\ntype. Second, we present a statistical framework for including systematic\nerrors and estimate the consequent degradation in sensitivity. These errors may\ncome from e.g. event reconstruction, Monte Carlo determination of the effective\narea or uncertainty in atmospheric conditions. Third, we show that performing\nthe analysis on a set of suitably optimised regions of interest makes it\npossible to partially compensate for the degradation in sensitivity caused by\nsystematics and diffuse emission. To probe dark matter with the canonical\nthermal annihilation cross-section, CTA systematics like non-uniform variations\nin acceptance over a single field of view must be kept below the 0.3% level,\nunless the dark matter density rises more steeply in the centre of the Galaxy\nthan predicted by a typical Navarro-Frenk-White or Einasto profile. For a\ncontracted $r^{-1.3}$ profile, and systematics at the 1% level, CTA can probe\nannihilation to $b\\bar{b}$ at the canonical thermal level for dark matter\nmasses between 100 GeV and 10 TeV.\n", "  We consider translationally-invariant percolation models on $\\mathbb{Z}^d$\nsatisfying the finite energy and the FKG properties. We provide explicit upper\nbounds on the probability of having two distinct clusters going from the\nendpoints of an edge to distance $n$ (this corresponds to a finite size version\nof the celebrated Burton-Keane [Comm. Math. Phys. 121 (1989) 501-505] argument\nproving uniqueness of the infinite-cluster). The proof is based on the\ngeneralization of a reverse Poincar\\'{e} inequality proved in Chatterjee and\nSen (2013). As a consequence, we obtain upper bounds on the probability of the\nso-called four-arm event for planar random-cluster models with cluster-weight\n$q\\ge1$.\n", "  Shape dynamics is classical theory of gravity which agrees with general\nrelativity in many important cases, but possesses different gauge symmetries\nand constraints. Rather than spacetime diffeomorphism invariance, shape\ndynamics takes spatial diffeomorphism invariance and spatial Weyl invariance as\nthe fundamental gauge symmetries associated with the gravitational field. Since\nthe area of the event horizon of a black hole transforms under a generic\nspatial Weyl transformation, there has been some doubt that one can speak\nsensibly about the thermodynamics of black holes in shape dynamics. The purpose\nof this paper is to show that by treating the event horizon of a black hole as\nan interior boundary, one can recover familiar notions of black hole\nthermodynamics in shape dynamics and define a gauge invariant entropy that\nagrees with general relativity.\n", "  In this paper, we give a very accurate description of the way the simple\nexclusion process relaxes to equilibrium. Let $P_t$ denote the semi-group\nassociated the exclusion on the circle with $2N$ sites and $N$ particles. For\nany initial condition $\\chi$, and for any $t\\ge\\frac{4N^2}{9\\pi ^2}\\log N$, we\nshow that the probability density $P_t(\\chi,\\cdot)$ is given by an exponential\ntilt of the equilibrium measure by the main eigenfunction of the particle\nsystem. As $\\frac{4N^2}{9\\pi^2}\\log N$ is smaller than the mixing time which is\n$\\frac{N^2}{2\\pi^2}\\log N$, this allows to give a sharp description of the\ncutoff profile: if $d_N(t)$ denote the total-variation distance starting from\nthe worse initial condition we have\n\\[\\lim_{N\\to\\infty}d_N\\biggl(\\frac{N^2}{2\\pi^2}\\log\nN+\\frac{N^2}{\\pi^2}s\\biggr)=\\operatorname\n{erf}\\biggl(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{\\pi}e^{-s}\\biggr),\\] where $\\operatorname {erf}$ is\nthe Gauss error function.\n", "  We present the most significant measurement of the cosmic microwave\nbackground (CMB) lensing potential to date (at a level of 40 sigma), using\ntemperature and polarization data from the Planck 2015 full-mission release.\nUsing a polarization-only estimator we detect lensing at a significance of 5\nsigma. We cross-check the accuracy of our measurement using the wide frequency\ncoverage and complementarity of the temperature and polarization measurements.\nPublic products based on this measurement include an estimate of the lensing\npotential over approximately 70% of the sky, an estimate of the lensing\npotential power spectrum in bandpowers for the multipole range 40<L<400 and an\nassociated likelihood for cosmological parameter constraints. We find good\nagreement between our measurement of the lensing potential power spectrum and\nthat found in the best-fitting LCDM model based on the Planck temperature and\npolarization power spectra. Using the lensing likelihood alone we obtain a\npercent-level measurement of the parameter combination $\\sigma_8\n\\Omega_m^{0.25} = 0.591\\pm 0.021$. We combine our determination of the lensing\npotential with the E-mode polarization also measured by Planck to generate an\nestimate of the lensing B-mode. We show that this lensing B-mode estimate is\ncorrelated with the B-modes observed directly by Planck at the expected level\nand with a statistical significance of 10 sigma, confirming Planck's\nsensitivity to this known sky signal. We also correlate our lensing potential\nestimate with the large-scale temperature anisotropies, detecting a\ncross-correlation at the 3 sigma level, as expected due to dark energy in the\nconcordance LCDM model.\n", "  We propose a background-independent formulation of cosmic inflation. The\ninflation in this picture corresponds to a dynamical process to generate space\nand time while the conventional inflation is simply an (exponential) expansion\nof a preexisting spacetime owing to the vacuum energy carried by an inflaton\nfield. We observe that the cosmic inflation is triggered by the condensate of\nPlanck energy into vacuum responsible for the dynamical emergence of spacetime\nand must be a single event according to the exclusion principle of\nnoncommutative spacetime caused by the Planck energy condensate in vacuum. The\nemergent spacetime picture admits a background-independent formulation so that\nthe inflation can be described by a conformal Hamiltonian system characterized\nby an exponential phase space expansion without introducing any inflaton field\nas well as an {\\it ad hoc} inflation potential. This implies that the emergent\nspacetime may incapacitate all the rationales to introduce the multiverse\nhypothesis. In Part I we will focus on the physical foundation of cosmic\ninflation from the emergent spacetime picture to highlight the main idea. Its\nmathematical exposition will be addressed in Part II with a generalization of\nthe emergent spacetime picture to matrix string theory.\n", "  For systems of lattice anyons like Majorana and parafermions, the\nunconventional quantum statistics determines a set of global symmetries (e.g.,\nfermion parity for Majoranas) admitting no relevant perturbations. Any operator\nthat breaks these symmetries explicitly would violate locality if added to the\nthe Hamiltonian. As a consequence, the associated quasi-degeneracy of\ntopologically non-trivial phases is protected, at least partially, by locality\nvia the symmetries singled out by quantum statistics. We show that it is\npossible to bypass this type of protection by way of specifically engineered\ngauge fields, in order to modify the topological structure of the edge of the\nsystem without destroying the topological order completely. To illustrate our\nideas in a concrete setting, we focus on the \\(\\Z_6\\) parafermion chain.\nStarting in the topological phase of the chain (sixfold ground degeneracy), we\nshow that a gauge field with restricted dynamics acts as a relevant\nperturbation, driving a transition to a phase with threefold degeneracy and\n\\(\\Z_3\\) parafermion edge modes. The transition from the \\(\\Z_3\\) to the\ntopologically trivial phase occurs on a critical line in the three-state Potts\nuniversality class. We also investigate numerically the emergence of Majorana\nedge modes when the \\(\\Z_6\\) chain is coupled to a differently restricted gauge\nfield.\n", "  We discuss, at the macro-level of nations, the contribution of research\nfunding and rate of international collaboration to research performance, with\nimportant implications for the science of science policy. In particular, we\ncross-correlate suitable measures of these quantities with a\nscientometric-based assessment of scientific success, studying both the average\nperformance of nations and their temporal dynamics in the space defined by\nthese variables during the last decade. We find significant differences among\nnations in terms of efficiency in turning (financial) input into\nbibliometrically measurable output, and we confirm that growth of international\ncollaboration positively correlate with scientific success, with significant\nbenefits brought by EU integration policies. Various geo-cultural clusters of\nnations naturally emerge from our analysis. We critically discuss the possible\nfactors that potentially determine the observed patterns.\n", "  The phenomenon of PT (parity- and time-reversal) symmetry breaking is\nconventionally associated with a change in the complex mode spectrum of a\nnon-Hermitian system that marks a transition from a purely oscillatory to an\nexponentially amplified dynamical regime. In this work we describe a new type\nof PT-symmetry breaking, which occurs in the steady-state energy distribution\nof open systems with balanced gain and loss. In particular, we show that the\ncombination of nonlinear saturation effects and the presence of thermal or\nquantum noise in actual experiments results in unexpected behavior that differs\nsignificantly from the usual dynamical picture. We observe additional phases\nwith preserved or `weakly' broken PT symmetry, and an unconventional transition\nfrom a high-noise thermal state to a low-amplitude lasing state with broken\nsymmetry and strongly reduced fluctuations. We illustrate these effects here\nfor the specific example of coupled mechanical resonators with\noptically-induced loss and gain, but the described mechanisms will be essential\nfor a general understanding of the steady-state properties of actual\nPT-symmetric systems operated at low amplitudes or close to the quantum regime.\n", "  We design from first principles a new type of two-dimensional metal-organic\nframeworks (MOFs) using phenalenyl-based ligands to exhibit a half-filled flat\nband of the kagome lattice, which is one of the lattice family that shows\nLieb-Mielke-Tasaki's flat-band ferromagnetism. Among various MOFs, we find that\n$\\textit{trans}$-Au-THTAP(trihydroxytriaminophenalenyl) has such an ideal band\nstructure, where the Fermi energy is adjusted right at the flat band due to\nunpaired electrons of radical phenalenyl. The spin-orbit coupling opens a band\ngap giving a non-zero Chern number to the nearly flat band, as confirmed by the\npresence of the edge states in first-principles calculations and by fitting to\nthe tight-binding model. This is a novel and realistic example of a system in\nwhich a nearly flat band is both ferromagnetic $\\textit{and}$ topologically\nnon-trivial.\n", "  We consider the dynamics of the quantum XY chain with disorder under the\ngeneral assumption that the expectation of the eigenfunction correlator of the\nassociated one-particle Hamiltonian satisfies a decay estimate typical of\nAnderson localization. We show that, starting from a broad class of product\ninitial states, entanglement remains bounded for all times. For the XX chain,\nwe also derive bounds on the particle transport which, in particular, show that\nthe density profile of initial states that consist of fully occupied and empty\nintervals, only have significant dynamics near the edges of those intervals,\nuniformly for all times.\n", "  Extreme Black holes are an important theoretical laboratory for exploring the\nnature of entropy. We suggest that this unusual nature of the extremal limit\ncould explain the entropy of extremal Kerr black holes. The time-independence\nof the extremal black hole, the zero surface gravity, the zero entropy and the\nabsence of a bifurcate Killing horizon are all related properties that define\nand reduce to one single unique feature of the extremal Kerr spacetime. We\nsuggest the presence of a true geometric discontinuity as the underlying cause\nof a vanishing entropy.\n", "  Mechanism of unconventional superconductivity in FeSe has been intensely\nscrutinized recently because of a variety of exotic properties unprecedented\nfor other iron-based superconductors. A central unanswered question concerns\nthe origin of the interaction that causes the nematic transition at $T_s=90\\,K$\nwithout accompanying magnetic order. Elucidating the nature of spin excitations\nin the normal state is a key to addressing this issue. Here we report, from\ninelastic neutron-scattering measurements in FeSe single crystals, that\nhigh-energy spin excitation spectra of FeSe exhibit characteristic energy\ndependence with missing intensity at around 70-80$\\,$meV, which are very\ndifferent from other iron-based superconductors. Despite of the strongest\nelectron correlations among the iron-based superconductor family, the spectra\nare qualitatively at variance with the local moment model and can be\nessentially described by the itinerant electron picture. Moreover, the\ndynamical spin susceptibility above $T_s$ is only weakly temperature dependent,\nwhich is in stark contrast to the Curie-Weiss behavior of the electronic\nnematic susceptibility, suggesting that the nematic transition is not likely\ndriven by spin but by orbital degrees of freedom.\n", "  We theoretically study the stability of three dimensional Dirac semimetals\nagainst short-range electron-electron interaction and quenched time-reversal\nsymmetric disorder (but excluding mass disorder). First we focus on the clean\ninteracting and the noninteracting dirty Dirac semimetal separately, and show\nthat they support two distinct quantum critical points. Using renormalization\ngroup techniques, we find that while interaction driven quantum critical points\nare \\emph{Gaussian} (mean-field) in nature, describing quantum phase\ntransitions into various broken symmetry phases, the ones controlled by\ndisorder are \\emph{non-Gaussian}, capturing the transition to a metallic phase.\nWe classify such diffusive quantum critical points based on the transformation\nof disorder vertices under a \\emph{continuous} chiral rotation. Our wek\ncoupling renormalization group analysis suggests that two distinct quantum\ncritical points are stable in an interacting dirty Dirac semimetal (with chiral\nsymmetric randomness), and a multicritical point (at finite interaction and\ndisorder) results from their interplay. By contrast, the chiral symmetry\nbreaking disorder driven critical point is unstable against weak interactions.\nEffects of weak disorder on the ordering tendencies in Dirac semimetal are\nanalyzed. The clean interacting critical points, however, satisfy the\n\\emph{Harris criterion}, and are therefore expected to be unstable against bond\ndisorder. Although our weak coupling analysis is inadequate to establish the\nultimate stability of these fixed points in the strong coupling regime (when\nboth interaction and disorder are strong), they can still govern crossover\nbehaviors in Dirac semimetals over a large length scale, when either\ninteraction or randomness is sufficiently weak.\n", "  Several boosted jet techniques use jet shape variables to discriminate the\nmulti-pronged signal from Quantum Chromodynamics backgrounds. In this paper, we\nprovide a first-principles study of an important class of jet shapes all of\nwhich put a constraint on the subjet mass: the mass-drop parameter ($\\mu^2$),\nthe $N$-subjettiness ratio ($\\tau_{21}^{(\\beta=2)}$) and energy correlation\nfunctions ($C_2^{(\\beta=2)}$ or $D_2^{(\\beta=2)}$). We provide analytic results\nboth for QCD background jets as well as for signal processes. We further study\nthe situation where cuts on these variables are applied recursively with\nCambridge-Aachen de-clustering of the original jet. We also explore the effect\nof the choice of axis for $N$-subjettiness and jet de-clustering. Our results\nbring substantial new insight into the nature, gain and relative performance of\neach of these methods, which we expect will influence their future application\nfor boosted object searches.\n", "  There are several phenomenological similarities between Soft Gamma Repeaters\nand Fast Radio Bursts, including duty factors, time scales and probable\nrepetition. The sudden release of magnetic energy in a neutron star\nmagnetosphere, as in popular models of SGR, can meet the energy requirements of\nFRB but requires both the presence of magnetospheric plasma in order that\ndissipation occur in a transparent region and a mechanism for releasing much of\nthat energy quickly. FRB sources and SGR are distinguished by long-lived (up to\nthousands of years) current-carrying coronal arches remaining from formation of\nthe young neutron star and their decay ends the phase of SGR/AXP/FRB activity\neven though \"magnetar\" fields may persist. Runaway increase in resistance when\nthe current density exceeds a threshold releases magnetostatic energy in a\nsudden burst and produces high brightness GHz emission of FRB by a coherent\nprocess; SGR are produced when released energy thermalizes as an equilibrium\npair plasma. Failures of some alternative FRB models and the non-detection of\nSGR~1806-20 at radio frequencies are discussed in appendices.\n", "  We consider the Labyrinth model, which is a two-dimensional quasicrystal\nmodel. We show that the spectrum of this model, which is known to be a product\nof two Cantor sets, is an interval for small values of the coupling constant.\nWe also consider the density of states measure of the Labyrinth model, and show\nthat it is absolutely continuous with respect to Lebesgue measure for almost\nall values of coupling constants in small coupling regime.\n", "  Interesting connection has been established between two apparently unrelated\nconcepts, namely, quantum nonlocality and Bayesian game theory. It has been\nshown that nonlocal correlations in the form of advice can outperform classical\nequilibrium strategies in common interest Bayesian games and also in\nconflicting interest games. However, classical equilibrium strategies can be of\ntwo types, fair and unfair. Whereas in fair equilibrium payoffs of different\nplayers are same, in unfair case they differ. Advantage of nonlocal correlation\nhas been demonstrated over fair strategies. In this work we show that quantum\nstrategies can outperform even the unfair classical equilibrium strategies. For\nthis purpose we consider a class of two players games which as a special case\nincludes the conflicting game proposed in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 114, 020401\n(2015)]. These games can have both fair and unfair classical equilibria and\nalso can have only unfair ones. We provide a simple analytic characterization\nof the nonlocal correlations that are advantageous over the classical\nequilibrium strategies in these games.\n", "  In this paper, we investigate localization of a bulk massless q-form field on\ncodimension-one brane by using a new Kaluza-Klein (KK) decomposition, for which\nthere are two types of KK modes for the bulk q-form field, the q-form and\n(q-1)-form modes. The first modes may be massive or massless while the second\nones are all masselss. These two types fo KK modes satisfy twy Schrodinger-like\nequations. For a five-dimensional brane model with a finite dimension, the\nspectrum of a bulk 3-form field on the brane consists of some massive bound\n3-form KK modes as well as some massless bound 2-form ones with different\nconfiguration along the extra dimension. These 2-form modes are different form\nthose obtained from a bulk 2-form field. For a five-dimensional degenerated\nBloch brane model with an infinite extra dimension, some massive 3-form\nresonant KK modes and corresponding massless 2-form resonant ones are obtained\nfor a bulk 3-form field.\n", "  We perform experiments to investigate the relaxation of a highly deformed\nelastic filament at a liquid-air interface. The dynamics for filaments of\ndiffering length, diameter and elastic modulus collapse to a single curve when\nthe time-dependence is scaled by a time scale $\\tau = 8 \\pi \\mu L_o^4/B$. The\nrelaxation, however, is completed in a very small fraction of the time $\\tau$.\nEven though the time scale $\\tau$ can be obtained by balancing the linear\nbending and viscous forces, it appears to control the highly nonlinear regime\nof our experiments. Nonlinear numerical simulations show that the force due to\ntension along the filament is comparable to the bending force, producing a net\nelastic restoring force that is much smaller than either term. We perform\nparticle image velocimetry at the liquid-air interface to support the results\nof the numerics. Finally, we find that when the filament is initialized in\nasymmetric shapes, it rapidly goes to a shape with symmetric stresses. This\nsymmetrisation process is entirely non-linear; we show that the symmetric\ncurvature state minimizes energy at arbitrarily large deformation.\n", "  We study the influence of black-hole evaporation on light propagation. The\nframework employed is based on the non-linear QED effective action at one-loop\nlevel. We show that the light-cone condition is modified for low-energy\nradiation due to black-hole evaporation. We discuss conditions under which the\nphase velocity of this low-energy radiation is greater than $c$. We also\ncompute the modified light-deflection angle, which turns out to be\nsignificantly different from the standard GR value for black-hole masses in the\nrange $M_\\text{Pl} \\ll M \\lesssim 10^{19}\\;M_\\text{Pl}$.\n", "  A theoretical model of a Bose-Einstein condensate with angular spin-orbit\ncoupling has recently been proposed and it has been established that a\nhalf-skyrmion represents the ground state in a certain regime of spin-orbit\ncoupling and interaction. Here we investigate low-lying excitations of this\nphase by using the Bogoliubov method and numerical simulations of the\ntime-dependent Gross-Pitaevskii equation. We find that a sudden shift of the\ntrap bottom results in a complex two-dimensional motion of the system's center\nof mass that is markedly different from the response of a competing phase, and\ncomprises two dominant frequencies. Moreover, the breathing mode frequency of\nthe half-skyrmion is set by both the spin-orbit coupling and the interaction\nstrength, while in the competing state it takes a universal value. Effects of\ninteractions are especially pronounced at the transition between the two\nphases.\n", "  The sustainability of structured biological, social, economic and ecological\ncommunities are often determined by the outcome of social conflicts between\ncooperative and selfish individuals (cheaters). Cheaters avoid the cost of\ncontributing to the community and can occasionally spread in the population\nleading to the complete collapse of cooperation. Although such a collapse often\nunfolds unexpectedly bearing the traits of a critical transition, it is unclear\nwhether one can detect the rising risk of cheater's invasions and loss of\ncooperation in an evolving community. Here, we combine dynamical networks and\nevolutionary game theory to study the abrupt loss of cooperation as a critical\ntransition. We estimate the risk of collapse of cooperation after the\nintroduction of a single cheater under gradually changing conditions. We\nobserve a systematic increase in the average time it takes for cheaters to be\neliminated from the community as the risk of collapse increases. We detect this\nrisk based on changes in community structure and composition. Nonetheless,\nreliable detection depends on the mechanism that governs how cheaters evolve in\nthe community. Our results suggest possible avenues for detecting the loss of\ncooperation in evolving communities\n", "  Observations of galaxy isophotes, longs-slit kinematics and high-resolution\nphotometry suggested a possible dichotomy between two distinct classes of E\ngalaxies. But these methods are expensive for large galaxy samples. Instead,\nintegral-field spectroscopic can efficiently recognize the shape, dynamics and\nstellar population of complete samples of early-type galaxies (ETGs). These\nstudies showed that the two main classes, the fast and slow rotators, can be\nseparated using stellar kinematics. We showed there is a dichotomy in the\ndynamics of the two classes. The slow rotators are weakly triaxial and dominate\nabove $M_{\\rm crit}\\approx2\\times10^{11} M_\\odot$. Below $M_{\\rm crit}$, the\nstructure of fast rotators parallels that of spiral galaxies. There is a smooth\nsequence along which, the metals content, the enhancement in $\\alpha$-elements,\nand the \"weight\" of the stellar initial mass function, all increase with the\nCENTRAL mass density slope, or bulge mass fraction, while the molecular gas\nfraction correspondingly decreases. The properties of ETGs on galaxy scaling\nrelations, and in particular the $(M_{\\ast}, R_{\\rm e})$ diagram, and their\ndependence on environment, indicate two main independent channels for galaxy\nevolution. Fast rotators ETGs start as star forming disks and evolve trough a\nchannel dominated by gas accretion, bulge growth and quenching. While slow\nrotators assemble near the center of massive halos via intense star formation\nat high redshift, and remain as such for the rest of their evolution via a\nchannel dominated by gas poor mergers. This is consistent with independent\nstudies of the galaxies redshift evolution.\n", "  It has recently been shown that the electronic states in bulk gapless HgCdTe\noffer another realization of pseudo-relativistic three-dimensional particles in\na condensed matter system. These single valley relativistic states, referred to\nas massless Kane fermions, cannot be described by any other well-known\nrelativistic massless particles. Furthermore, the HgCdTe band structure can be\ncontinuously tailored by modifying either the cadmium content or temperature.\nAt the critical concentration or temperature, the bandgap, Eg, collapses as the\nsystem undergoes a semimetal-to-semiconductor topological phase transition\nbetween the inverted and normal alignments. Here, using far-infrared\nmagneto-spectroscopy we explore the continuous evolution of band structure of\nbulk HgCdTe as temperature is tuned across the topological phase transition. We\ndemonstrate that the rest-mass of the Dirac-like Kane fermions, m changes sign\nat the critical temperature, while their velocity, c remains constant. The\nrelation Eg = 2mc2 with the universal value of c = (1.07 +- 0.05)10x6 m/s\nremains valid in a broad range of temperatures and Cd concentrations,\nindicating a striking universality of the pseudo-relativistic description of\nthe Dirac-like Kane fermions in HgCdTe.\n", "  We use the effective field theory of dark energy (EFT of DE) formalism to\nconstrain dark energy models belonging to the Horndeski class with the recent\nPlanck 2015 CMB data. The space of theories is spanned by a certain number of\nparameters determining the linear cosmological perturbations, while the\nexpansion history is set to that of a standard $\\Lambda$CDM model. We always\ndemand that the theories be free of fatal instabilities. Additionally, we\nconsider two optional conditions, namely that scalar and tensor perturbations\npropagate with subliminal speed. Such criteria severely restrict the allowed\nparameter space and are thus very effective in shaping the posteriors. As a\nresult, we confirm that no theory performs better than $\\Lambda$CDM when CMB\ndata alone are analysed. Indeed, the healthy dark energy models considered here\nare not able to reproduce those phenomenological behaviours of the effective\nNewton constant and gravitational slip parameters that, according to previous\nstudies, best fit the data.\n", "  We study the role of quantum entanglement (particle entanglement and mode\nentanglement) in optical phase estimation by employing the first and second\nquantization formalisms of quantum mechanics. The quantum Fisher information\n(QFI) is expressed as a function of the first and second order optical\ncoherence functions. The resulting form of the QFI elucidates the deriving\nmetrological resources for quantum phase estimation: field intensity and photon\ndetection correlations. In addition, our analysis confirms that mode\nentanglement is not required for quantum-enhanced interferometry, whereas\nparticle entanglement is a necessary requirement.\n", "  A search is presented for single top quark production in the s channel in\nproton-proton collisions with the CMS detector at the CERN LHC in decay modes\nof the top quark containing a muon or an electron in the final state. The\nsignal is extracted through a maximum-likelihood fit to the distribution of a\nmultivariate discriminant defined using boosted decision trees to separate the\nexpected signal contribution from background processes. The analysis uses data\ncollected at centre-of-mass energies of 7 and 8 TeV and corresponding to\nintegrated luminosities of 5.1 and 19.7 inverse femtobarns, respectively. The\nmeasured cross sections of 7.1 +/- 8.1 pb (at 7 TeV) and 13.4 +/- 7.3 pb (at 8\nTeV) result in a best fit value of 2.0 +/- 0.9 for the combined ratio of the\nmeasured and expected values. The signal significance is 2.5 standard\ndeviations, and the upper limit on the rate relative to the standard model\nexpectation is 4.7 at 95% confidence level.\n", "  The high sensitivity of the new generation of radio telescopes such as the\nSquare Kilometre Array (SKA) will allow cosmological weak lensing measurements\nat radio wavelengths that are competitive with optical surveys. We present an\nadaptation to radio data of lensfit, a method for galaxy shape measurement\noriginally developed and used for optical weak lensing surveys. This likelihood\nmethod uses an analytical galaxy model and makes a Bayesian marginalisation of\nthe likelihood over uninteresting parameters. It has the feature of working\ndirectly in the visibility domain, which is the natural approach to adopt with\nradio interferometer data, avoiding systematics introduced by the imaging\nprocess. As a proof of concept, we provide results for visibility simulations\nof individual galaxies with flux density S >= 10 muJy at the phase centre of\nthe proposed SKA1-MID baseline configuration, adopting 12 frequency channels in\nthe band 950 - 1190 MHz. Weak lensing shear measurements from a population of\ngalaxies with realistic flux and scalelength distributions are obtained after\nnatural gridding of the raw visibilities. Shear measurements are expected to be\naffected by \"noise bias\": we estimate the bias in the method as a function of\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR). We obtain additive and multiplicative bias values\nthat are comparable to SKA1 requirements for SNR > 18 and SNR > 30,\nrespectively. The multiplicative bias for SNR > 10 is comparable to that found\nin ground-based optical surveys such as CFHTLenS, and we anticipate that\nsimilar shear measurement calibration strategies to those used for optical\nsurveys may be used to good effect in the analysis of SKA radio interferometer\ndata.\n", "  We study the development and saturation of the $m=1$ one-armed spiral\ninstability in remnants of binary neutron star mergers by means of\nhigh-resolution long-term numerical relativity simulations. Our results suggest\nthat this instability is a generic outcome of neutron stars mergers in\nastrophysically relevant configurations; including both \"stiff\" and \"soft\"\nnuclear equations of state. We find that, once seeded at merger, the $m=1$ mode\nsaturates within $\\sim 10\\ \\mathrm{ms}$ and persists over secular timescales.\nGravitational waves emitted by the $m=1$ instability have a peak frequency\naround $1-2\\ \\mathrm{kHz}$ and, if detected, could be used to constrain the\nequation of state of neutron stars. We construct hybrid waveforms spanning the\nentire Advanced LIGO band by combining our high-resolution numerical data with\nstate-of-the-art effective-one-body waveforms including tidal effects. We use\nthe complete hybrid waveforms to study the detectability of the one-armed\nspiral instability for both Advanced LIGO and the Einstein Telescope. We\nconclude that the one-armed spiral instability is not an efficient\ngravitational wave emitter. Its observation by current generation detectors is\nunlikely and will require third-generation interferometers.\n", "  Time-reversal (TR) refocusing of waves is one of fundamental principles in\nwave physics. Using the TR approach, \"Time-reversal mirrors\" can physically\ncreate a time-reversed wave that exactly refocus back, in space and time, to\nits original source regardless of the complexity of the medium as if time were\ngoing backwards. Lately, laboratory experiments proved that this approach can\nbe applied not only in acoustics and electromagnetism but also in the field of\nlinear and nonlinear water waves. Studying the range of validity and\nlimitations of the TR approach may determine and quantify its range of\napplicability in hydrodynamics. In this context, we report a numerical study of\nhydrodynamic TR using a uni-directional numerical wave tank, implemented by the\nnonlinear high-order spectral method, known to accurately model the physical\nprocesses at play, beyond physical laboratory restrictions. The applicability\nof the TR approach is assessed over a variety of hydrodynamic localized and\npulsating structures' configurations, pointing out the importance of high-order\ndispersive and particularly nonlinear effects in the refocusing of hydrodynamic\nstationary envelope solitons and breathers. We expect that the results may\nmotivate similar experiments in other nonlinear dispersive media and encourage\nseveral applications with particular emphasis on the field of ocean\nengineering.\n", "  We consider a non-standard model of gravity coupled to a neutral scalar\n\"inflaton\" as well as to SU(2)xU(1) iso-doublet scalar with positive mass\nsquared and without self-interaction, and to SU(2)xU(1) gauge fields. The\nprincipal new ingredient is employing two alternative non-Riemannian space-time\nvolume-forms (covariant integration measure densitities) independent of the\nmetric. The latter have a remarkable impact - although not introducing any\nadditional propagating degrees of freedom, their dynamics triggers a series of\nimportant features: appearance of infinitely large flat regions of the\neffective \"inflaton\" potential as well as dynamical generation of Higgs-like\nspontaneous symmetry breaking effective potential for the SU(2)xU(1)\niso-doublet scalar.\n", "  We investigate time-dependent electron transfer (ET) in benchmark\ndonor-bridge-acceptor systems. For the small bridge sizes studied, we obtain\nresults far different from the perturbation theory which underlies\nscattering-based approaches, notably a lack of destructive interference in the\nET for certain arrangements of bridge molecules. We also calculate wavepacket\ntransmission in the non-steady-state regime, finding a featureless spectrum,\nwhile for the current we find two types of transmission: sequential and direct,\nwhere in the latter, the current transmission increases as a function of the\nenergy of the transferred electron, a regime inaccessible by conventional\nscattering theory.\n", "  A recommendation system uses the past purchases or ratings of $n$ products by\na group of $m$ users, in order to provide personalized recommendations to\nindividual users. The information is modeled as an $m \\times n$ preference\nmatrix which is assumed to have a good rank-$k$ approximation, for a small\nconstant $k$.\n  In this work, we present a quantum algorithm for recommendation systems that\nhas running time $O(\\text{poly}(k)\\text{polylog}(mn))$. All known classical\nalgorithms for recommendation systems that work through reconstructing an\napproximation of the preference matrix run in time polynomial in the matrix\ndimension. Our algorithm provides good recommendations by sampling efficiently\nfrom an approximation of the preference matrix, without reconstructing the\nentire matrix. For this, we design an efficient quantum procedure to project a\ngiven vector onto the row space of a given matrix. This is the first algorithm\nfor recommendation systems that runs in time polylogarithmic in the dimensions\nof the matrix and provides an example of a quantum machine learning algorithm\nfor a real world application.\n", "  An unusual form of superconductivity, called Ising superconductivity, has\nrecently been uncovered in mono- and few-layered transition metal\ndichalcogenides. This 2D superconducting state is characterized by the\nso-called Ising spin-orbit coupling (SOC), which produces strong oppositely\noriented effective Zeeman fields perpendicular to the 2D layer in opposite\nmomentum space valleys. We examine the Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) bound states\nlocalized at magnetic impurities in Ising superconductors and show that the\nunusual SOC manifests itself in unusually strong anisotropy in magnetic field\nresponse of zero bias conductance peaks observable in STM experiments on\nimpurity sites. For a chain of magnetic impurities with moments parallel to the\nplane of Ising superconductors we show that the low energy YSR band can host\ntopological superconductivity and Majorana fermions as a direct manifestation\nof Ising spin-orbit coupling induced topological effects.\n", "  In this work we study the dimensional reduction of smooth circle invariant\nYang-Mills instantons defined on 4-manifolds which are non-trivial circle\nfibrations over hyperbolic 3-space. A suitable choice of the 4-manifold metric\nwithin a specific conformal class gives rise to singular and smooth hyperbolic\nmonopoles. A large class of monopoles is obtained if the conformal factor\nsatisfies the Helmholtz equation on hyperbolic 3-space. We describe simple\nconfigurations and relate our results to the JNR construction, for which we\nprovide a geometric interpretation.\n", "  We report on optical reflectivity experiments performed on Cd3As2 over a\nbroad range of photon energies and magnetic fields. The observed response\nclearly indicates the presence of 3D massless charge carriers. The specific\ncyclotron resonance absorption in the quantum limit implies that we are probing\nmassless Kane electrons rather than symmetry-protected 3D Dirac particles. The\nlatter may appear at a smaller energy scale and are not directly observed in\nour infrared experiments.\n", "  We present a theory of quantum oscillations in insulators that are\nparticle-hole symmetric and non-topological but with arbitrary band dispersion,\nat both zero and non-zero temperature. At temperatures $T$ less than or\ncomparable to the gap, the dependence of oscillations on $T$ is markedly\ndifferent from that in metals and depends crucially on the position of the\nchemical potential $\\mu$ in the gap. If $\\mu$ is in the middle of the gap,\noscillations do not change with $T$; however, if $\\mu$ is asymmetrically\npositioned in the gap, surprisingly, oscillations go to zero at a critical\nvalue of the inverse field determined by $T$ and $\\mu$ and then change their\nphase by $\\pi$ and grow again. Additionally, the temperature dependence is\ndifferent for quantities derived from the grand canonical potential, such as\nmagnetization and susceptibility, and those derived from the density of states,\nsuch as resistivity. However, the non-trivial features arising from asymmetric\n$\\mu$ are present in both.\n", "  We have embedded a small Josephson junction in a microwave resonator that\nallows simultaneous dc biasing and dispersive readout. Thermal fluctuations\ndrive the junction into phase diffusion and induce a temperature-dependent\nshift in the resonance frequency. By sensing the thermal noise of a remote\nresistor in this manner, we demonstrate primary thermometry in the range from\n300 mK to below 100 mK, and high-bandwidth (7.5 MHz) operation with a\nnoise-equivalent temperature of better than 10 $\\mathrm{\\mu K/\\sqrt{Hz}}$. At a\nfinite bias voltage close to a Fiske resonance, amplification of the microwave\nprobe signal is observed. We develop an accurate theoretical model of our\ndevice based on the theory of dynamical Coulomb blockade.\n", "  Credit and liquidity risks represent main channels of financial contagion for\ninterbank lending markets. On one hand, banks face potential losses whenever\ntheir counterparties are under distress and thus unable to fulfill their\nobligations. On the other hand, solvency constraints may force banks to recover\nlost fundings by selling their illiquid assets, resulting in effective losses\nin the presence of fire sales - that is, when funding shortcomings are\nwidespread over the market. Because of the complex structure of the network of\ninterbank exposures, these losses reverberate among banks and eventually get\namplified, with potentially catastrophic consequences for the whole financial\nsystem. Building on Debt Rank [Battiston et al., 2012], in this work we define\na systemic risk metric that estimates the potential amplification of losses in\ninterbank markets accounting for both credit and liquidity contagion channels:\nthe Debt-Solvency Rank. We implement this framework on a dataset of 183\nEuropean banks that were publicly traded between 2004 and 2013, showing indeed\nthat liquidity spillovers substantially increase systemic risk, and thus cannot\nbe neglected in stress-test scenarios. We also provide additional evidence that\nthe interbank market was extremely fragile up to the 2008 financial crisis,\nbecoming slightly more robust only afterwards.\n", "  The quantum backflow effect is a counterintuitive behavior of the probability\ncurrent of a free particle, which may be negative even for states with\nvanishing negative momentum component. Here we address the notion of\nnonclassicality arising from the backflow effect, i.e. from the negativity of\nthe probability current, and analyze its relationships with the notion of\nnonclassicality based on the negativity of the Wigner function. Our results\nsuggest that backflow is linked to a different, and in fact more restrictive,\nnotion of nonclassicality, the negativity of the Wigner function being only a\nnecessary prerequisite for its occurrence. This hierarchical structure may be\nconfirmed by looking at the addition of thermal noise, which more easily\ndestroys the negativity of the probability current than the negativity of the\nWigner function itself.\n", "  Isotropy-violation statistics can highlight polarized galactic foregrounds\nthat contaminate primordial $B$-modes in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB).\nWe propose a particular isotropy-violation test and apply it to polarized\nPlanck 353 GHz data, constructing an map that indicates $B$-mode foreground\ndust power over the sky. We build our main isotropy test in harmonic space via\nthe bipolar spherical harmonic basis, and our method helps us to identify the\nleast-contaminated directions. By this measure, there are regions of low\nforeground in and around the BICEP field, near the South Galactic Pole, and in\nthe Northern Galactic Hemisphere. There is also a possible foreground feature\nin the BICEP field. We compare our results to those based on the local power\nspectrum, which is computed on discs using a version of the method of Planck\nInt.~XXX (2016). The discs method is closely related to our isotropy-violation\ndiagnostic. We pay special care to the treatment of noise, including chance\ncorrelations with the foregrounds. Currently we use our isotropy tool to assess\nthe cleanest portions of the sky, but in the future such methods will allow\nisotropy-based null tests for foreground contamination in maps purported to\nmeasure primordial $B$-modes, particularly in cases of limited frequency\ncoverage.\n", "  The Advanced LIGO observatory recently reported (Abbott et al., 2016a) the\nfirst direct detection of gravitational waves predicted by Einstein (1916). The\ndetection of this event was predicted in 1997 on the basis of the Scenario\nMachine population synthesis calculations (Lipunov et al., NewA, 2, 43). Now we\ndiscuss the parameters of binary black holes and event rates predicted by\ndifferent scenarios of binary evolution. We give a simple explanation of the\nbig difference between detected black hole masses and the mean black hole\nmasses observed in of X-ray Nova systems. The proximity of the masses of the\ncomponents of GW150914 is in good agreement with the observed initial mass\nratio distribution in massive binary systems, as is used in Scenario Machine\ncalculations for massive binaries.\n", "  Voltage-gated sodium (Na$_\\mathrm{v}$) channels are responsible for the\ndepolarizing phase of the action potential in most nerve cells, and\nNa$_\\mathrm{v}$ channel localization to the axon initial segment is vital to\naction potential initiation. Na$_\\mathrm{v}$ channels in the soma play a role\nin the transfer of axonal output information to the rest of the neuron and in\nsynaptic plasticity, although little is known about Na$_\\mathrm{v}$ channel\nlocalization and dynamics within this neuronal compartment. This study uses\nsingle-particle tracking and photoactivation localization microscopy to analyze\ncell-surface Na$_\\mathrm{v}$1.6 within the soma of cultured hippocampal\nneurons. Mean-square displacement analysis of individual trajectories indicated\nthat half of the somatic Na$_\\mathrm{v}$1.6 channels localized to stable\nnanoclusters $\\sim$230 nm in diameter. Strikingly, these domains were\nstabilized at specific sites on the cell membrane for >30 min, notably via an\nankyrin-independent mechanism, indicating that the means by which\nNa$_\\mathrm{v}$1.6 nanoclusters are maintained in the soma is biologically\ndifferent from axonal localization. Nonclustered Na$_\\mathrm{v}$1.6 channels\nshowed anomalous diffusion, as determined by mean-square-displacement analysis.\nHigh-density single-particle tracking of Na$_\\mathrm{v}$ channels labeled with\nphotoactivatable fluorophores in combination with Bayesian inference analysis\nwas employed to characterize the surface nanoclusters. A subpopulation of\nmobile Na$_\\mathrm{v}$1.6 was observed to be transiently trapped in the\nnanoclusters. Somatic Na$_\\mathrm{v}$1.6 nanoclusters represent a new, to our\nknowledge, type of Na$_\\mathrm{v}$ channel localization, and are hypothesized\nto be sites of localized channel regulation.\n", "  The article provides an open discussion and a critical feedback to the\ncomments of Haack et al. (2015) and emphasizes a significance of the first\nmacroscopic evidence for a candidate meteorite of a new type: planetary-origin\nmeteorite composed of silica-rich sedimentary rock. Discussion concerns the\narguments for (i) candidate parental bodies including the Earth, Mars and icy\nmoons of Saturn and Jupiter; (ii) PGE anomaly versus glassy silicate\nmicrospherules and quartz grains anomaly in the area of the 1908 Tunguska\ncatastrophe; (iii) isotopic heterogeneity of unmixed silicate reservoirs on\nMars; (iv) possible terrestrial loss or contamination in the noble gas\nsignatures in meteorites that spent time in the extreme weather conditions; (v)\ncosmogenic isotopes and shielding; and (vi) pseudo meteorites. We conclude that\nthe list of candidate parental bodies for hypothetical sedimentary-origin\nmeteorites includes, but is not limited by the Earth, Mars, Enceladus,\nGanymede, and Europa. A parental body should be identified based on the entire\nbody of evidence which is not limited solely by tests of oxygen and noble gas\nisotopes whose signatures may undergo terrestrial contamination and may exhibit\nsignificant heterogeneity within the parental bodies.\n", "  Numerical calculations have been performed to understand the reason for the\nobserved non-uniform response of a Resistive Plate Chamber (RPC) in a few\ncritical regions such as near edge spacers and corners of the device. In this\ncontext, the signal from a RPC due to the passage of muons through different\nregions has been computed. Also, a simulation of RPC timing properties is\npresented along with the effect of the applied field, gas mixture and\ngeometrical components.\n", "  Germanene nanoribbons, with buckled structures, exhibit unique electronic\nproperties. The complicated relations among the quantum confinement, the\nspin-orbital coupling, the magnetic quantization, the electric-field dominated\nquantum numbers, energy dispersions, energy gap, state degeneracy, and wave\nfunctions. Such mechanisms can diversify spatial charge distributions and spin\nconfigurations on distinct sublattices. There exist the spin-split quasi-Landau\nlevels and the valley-dependent asymmetric energy spectrum in a composite\nelectric and magnetic field, manly owing to the destruction of z=0 mirror\nsymmetry. The rich electronic structures are revealed in density of states as a\nlot of special structures. The predicted results could be directly verified by\nthe scanning tunneling spectroscopy.\n", "  This is a supplement to the Letter of Singer et al.\n(https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.07333), in which we demonstrated a rapid algorithm\nfor obtaining joint 3D estimates of sky location and luminosity distance from\nobservations of binary neutron star mergers with Advanced LIGO and Virgo. We\nargued that combining the reconstructed volumes with positions and redshifts of\npossible host galaxies can provide large-aperture but small field of view\ninstruments with a manageable list of targets to search for optical or infrared\nemission. In this Supplement, we document the new HEALPix-based file format for\n3D localizations of gravitational-wave transients. We include Python sample\ncode to show the reader how to perform simple manipulations of the 3D sky maps\nand extract ranked lists of likely host galaxies. Finally, we include\nmathematical details of the rapid volume reconstruction algorithm.\n", "  Experimental groups are now fabricating quantum processors powerful enough to\nexecute small instances of quantum algorithms and definitively demonstrate\nquantum error correction that extends the lifetime of quantum data, adding\nurgency to architectural investigations. Although other options continue to be\nexplored, effort is coalescing around topological coding models as the most\npractical implementation option for error correction on realizable\nmicroarchitectures. Scalability concerns have also motivated architects to\npropose distributed memory multicomputer architectures, with experimental\nefforts demonstrating some of the basic building blocks to make such designs\npossible. We compile the latest results from a variety of different systems\naiming at the construction of a scalable quantum computer.\n", "  A fundamental assumption in the standard model of cosmology is that the\nUniverse is isotropic on large scales. Breaking this assumption leads to a set\nof solutions to Einstein's field equations, known as Bianchi cosmologies, only\na subset of which have ever been tested against data. For the first time, we\nconsider all degrees of freedom in these solutions to conduct a general test of\nisotropy using cosmic microwave background temperature and polarization data\nfrom Planck. For the vector mode (associated with vorticity), we obtain a limit\non the anisotropic expansion of $(\\sigma_V/H)_0 < 4.7 \\times 10^{-11}$ (95%\nCI), which is an order of magnitude tighter than previous Planck results that\nused CMB temperature only. We also place upper limits on other modes of\nanisotropic expansion, with the weakest limit arising from the regular tensor\nmode, $(\\sigma_{T,\\rm reg}/H)_0<1.0 \\times 10^{-6}$ (95% CI). Including all\ndegrees of freedom simultaneously for the first time, anisotropic expansion of\nthe Universe is strongly disfavoured, with odds of 121,000:1 against.\n", "  We study the probability distribution function (PDF) of mass surface\ndensities, $\\Sigma$, of infrared dark cloud (IRDC) G028.37+00.07 and its\nsurrounding giant molecular cloud. This PDF constrains the physical processes,\nsuch as turbulence, magnetic fields and self-gravity, that are expected to be\ncontrolling cloud structure and star formation activity. The chosen IRDC is of\nparticular interest since it has almost 100,000 solar masses within a radius of\n8 parsecs, making it one of the most massive, dense molecular structures known\nand is thus a potential site for the formation of a \"super star cluster.\" We\nstudy $\\Sigma$ in two ways. First, we use a combination of NIR and MIR\nextinction maps that are able to probe the bulk of the cloud structure up to\n$\\Sigma\\sim1\\:{\\rm{g\\:cm}^{-2}}\\:$($A_V\\simeq200$ mag). Second, we study the\nFIR and sub-mm dust continuum emission from the cloud utilizing Herschel PACS\nand SPIRE images and paying careful attention to the effects of foreground and\nbackground contamination. We find that the PDFs from both methods, applied over\na $\\sim20^\\prime$(30 pc)-sized region that contains\n$\\simeq1.5\\times10^5\\:M_\\odot$ and encloses a minimum closed contour with\n$\\Sigma\\simeq0.013\\:{\\rm{g\\:cm}^{-2}}\\:$($A_V\\simeq3$ mag), shows a log-normal\nshape with the peak measured at\n$\\Sigma\\simeq0.021\\:{\\rm{g\\:cm}^{-2}}\\:$($A_V\\simeq4.7$ mag). There is\ntentative evidence for the presence of a high-$\\Sigma$ power law tail that\ncontains from $\\sim3\\%$ to 8\\% of the mass of the cloud material. We discuss\nthe implications of these results for the physical processes occurring in this\ncloud.\n", "  We report on a waveguide engineering technique that enables the generation of\na bandwidth up to 1 THz and record ultra-short pulse length of 2.5 ps in\ninjection seeded terahertz quantum cascade lasers. The reported technique is\nable to control and fully suppress higher order lateral modes in broadband\nterahertz quantum cascade lasers by introducing side-absorbers to metal-metal\nwaveguides. The side-absorbers consist of a top metalization set-back with\nrespect to the laser ridge and an additional lossy metal layer. In continuous\nwave operation the side-absorbers lead to octave spanning laser emission,\nranging from 1.63 to 3.37 THz, exhibiting a 725 GHz wide at top within a 10 dB\nintensity range as well as frequency comb operation with a bandwidth of 442\nGHz. Numerical and experimental studies have been performed to optimize the\nimpact of the side-absorbers on the emission properties and to determine the\nrequired increase of waveguide losses. Furthermore, these studies have led to a\nbetter understanding of the pulse formation dynamics of injection-seeded\nquantum cascade lasers.\n", "  Highly-optimized complex transport networks serve crucial functions in many\nman-made and natural systems such as power grids and plant or animal\nvasculature. Often, the relevant optimization functional is non-convex and\ncharacterized by many local extrema. In general, finding the global, or nearly\nglobal optimum is difficult. In biological systems, it is believed that natural\nselection slowly guides the network towards an optimized state. However,\ngeneral coarse grained models for flow networks with local positive feedback\nrules for the vessel conductivity typically get trapped in low efficiency,\nlocal minima. In this work we show how the growth of the underlying tissue,\ncoupled to the dynamical equations for network development, can drive the\nsystem to a dramatically improved optimal state. This general model provides a\nsurprisingly simple explanation for the appearance of highly optimized\ntransport networks in biology such as leaf and animal vasculature.\n", "  This work is devoted to incorporating into QFT the notion that particles and\nhence the particle states should be localizable in space. It focuses on the\ncase of the Dirac field in 1+1 dimensional flat spacetime, generalizing a\nrecently developed formalism for scalar fields. This is achieved exploiting\nagain the non-uniqueness of quantization process. Instead of elementary\nexcitations carrying definite amounts of energy and momentum, we construct the\nelementary excitations of the field localized (at some instant) in a definite\nregion of space. This construction not only leads to a natural notion of\nlocalized quanta, but also provides a local algebra of operators. Once\nconstructed, the new representation is confronted to the standard global (Fock)\nconstruction. In spite of being unitarily inequivalent representations, the\nlocalized operators are well defined in the conventional Fock space. By using\nthem we dig up the issues of localization in QFT showing how the globality of\nthe vacuum state is responsible for the lack of a \"common sense localization\"\nnotion for particles in the standard Fock representation of QFT and propose a\nmethod to meet its requirements.\n", "  We apply the leading-log high-energy resummation technique recently derived\nby some of us to the transverse momentum (pt) distribution for production of a\nHiggs boson in gluon fusion. We use our results to obtain information on\nmass-dependent corrections to this observable, which is only known at leading\norder when exact mass dependence is included. In the low pt region we discuss\nthe all-order exponentiation of collinear bottom mass logarithms. In the high\npt region we show that the infinite top mass approximation loses accuracy as a\npower of pt, while the accuracy of the high-energy approximation is\napproximately constant as pt grows. We argue that a good approximation to the\nNLO result for pt >~200 GeV can be obtained by combining the full LO result\nwith a K-factor computed using the high-energy approximation.\n", "  In quadrupole-bound anions, an extra electron is attached at a sufficiently\nlarge quadrupole moment of a neutral molecule, which is lacking a permanent\ndipole moment. The nature of the bound states and low-lying resonances of such\nanions is of interest for understanding the threshold behavior of open quantum\nsystems in general. In this work, we investigate the properties of quadrupolar\nanions as extreme halo systems, the formation of rotational bands, and the\ntransition from a subcritical to supercritical electric quadrupole moment. We\nsolve the electron-plus-molecule problem using a non-adiabatic coupled-channel\nformalism by employing the Berggren ensemble, which explicitly contains bound\nstates, narrow resonances, and the scattering continuum. We demonstrate that\nbinding energies and radii of quadrupolar anions strictly follow the scaling\nlaws for two-body halo systems. Contrary to the case of dipolar anions,\nground-state band of quadrupolar anions smoothly extend into the continuum, and\nmany rotational bands could be identified above the detachment threshold. We\nstudy the evolution of a bound state of an anion as to dives into the continuum\nat a critical quadrupole moment and we show that the associated critical\nexponent is consistent with the second-order phase transition. Everything\nconsidered, quadrupolar anions represent a perfect laboratory for the studies\nof marginally bound open quantum systems.\n", "  We introduce two potentials explicitly given by the Lambert-W function for\nwhich the exact solution of the one-dimensional stationary Schr\\\"odinger\nequation is written through the first derivative of a double-confluent Heun\nfunction. One of these potentials is a singular potential that behaves as the\ninverse square root in the vicinity of the origin and vanishes exponentially at\nthe infinity. The exact solution of the Schr\\\"odinger equation for this\npotential is given through fundamental solutions each of which presents an\nirreducible linear combination of two confluent hypergeometric functions. Since\nthe potential is effectively a short-range one it supports only a finite number\nof bound states.\n", "  We report results of joint experimental and theoretical studies on\nmagnetoelectric (ME) compounds Co4Nb2O9 and Co4Ta2O9. On the experimental side,\nwe present results of the magnetization and dielectric permittivity\nmeasurements in the magnetic field. On the theoretical side, we construct the\nlow-energy Hubbard-type model for the magnetically active Co 3d bands in the\nWannier basis, using the input of first-principles electronic structure\ncalculations, solve this model in the mean-field Hartree-Fock approximation,\nand evaluate the electric polarization in terms of the Berry phase theory. Both\nexperimental and theoretical results suggest that Co4Ta2O9 is magnetically\nsofter than Co4Nb2O9. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that the\nantiferromagnetic structure of Co4Ta2O9 can be easier deformed by the external\nmagnetic field, yielding larger polarization. This trend is indeed reproduced\nby our theoretical calculations, but does not seem to be consistent with the\nexperimental behavior of the polarization and dielectric permittivity. Thus, we\nsuggest that there should be a hidden mechanism controlling the ME coupling in\nthese compounds, probably related to the magnetic striction or a spontaneous\nchange of the magnetic structure, which breaks the inversion symmetry.\nFurthermore, we argue that unlike in other ME systems (e.g. Cr2O3), in Co4Nb2O9\nand Co4Ta2O9 there are two crystallographic sublattices, which contribute to\nthe ME effect. These contributions are found to be of the opposite sign and\ntend to compensate each other. The latter mechanism can be also used to control\nand reverse the electric polarization in these compounds.\n", "  We demonstrate that topological Dirac semimetals, which possess two Dirac\nnodes, separated in momentum space along a rotation axis and protected by\nrotational symmetry, exhibit an additional quantum anomaly, distinct from the\nchiral anomaly. This anomaly, which we call the $ \\mathbb Z_2$ anomaly, is a\nconsequence of the fact that the Dirac nodes in topological Dirac semimetals\ncarry a $\\mathbb Z_2$ topological charge. The $\\mathbb Z_2$ anomaly refers to\nnonconservation of this charge in the presence of external fields due to\nquantum effects and has observable consequences due to its interplay with the\nchiral anomaly. We discuss possible implications of this for the interpretation\nof magnetotransport experiments on topological Dirac semimetals. We also\nprovide a possible explanation for the magnetic field dependent angular\nnarrowing of the negative longitudinal magnetoresistance, observed in a recent\nexperiment on Na$_3$Bi.\n", "  The finite-size correction to $\\beta$-decay plays an important role in\ndetermining the expected antineutrino spectra from reactors at a level that is\nimportant for the reactor-neutrino anomaly. Here we express the leading-order\nfinite-size correction to allowed $\\beta$-decay in terms of Zemach moments. We\ncalculate the Zemach moments within a Hartree-Fock model using a Skyrme-like\nenergy density functional. We find that the Zemach moments are increased\nrelative to predictions based on the simple assumption of identical uniform\nnuclear-charge and weak-transition densities. However, for allowed ground-state\nto ground-state transitions in medium and heavy nuclei, the detailed nuclear\nstructure calculations do not change the finite-size corrections significantly\nfrom the simple model predictions, and are only 10-15% larger than the latter\neven though the densities differ significantly.\n", "  An enhancement in Brillouin light scattering of optical photons with magnons\nis demonstrated in magneto-optical whispering gallery mode resonators tuned to\na triple resonance point. This occurs when both the input and output optical\nmodes are resonant with those of the whispering gallery resonator, with a\nseparation given by the ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) frequency. The\nidentification and excitation of specific optical modes allows us to gain a\nclear understanding of the mode-matching conditions. A selection rule due to\nwavevector matching leads to an intrinsic single-sideband excitation. Strong\nsuppression of one sideband is essential for one-to-one frequency mapping in\ncoherent optical-to-microwave conversion.\n", "  Highly directional radiation from photonic structures is important for many\napplications, including high power photonic crystal surface emitting lasers,\ngrating couplers, and light detection and ranging devices. However, previous\ndielectric, few-layer designs only achieved moderate asymmetry ratios, and a\nfundamental understanding of bounds on asymmetric radiation from arbitrary\nstructures is still lacking. Here, we show that breaking the 180$^\\circ$\nrotational symmetry of the structure is crucial for achieving highly asymmetric\nradiation. We develop a general temporal coupled-mode theory formalism to\nderive bounds on the asymmetric decay rates to the top and bottom of a photonic\ncrystal slab for a resonance with arbitrary in-plane wavevector. Guided by this\nformalism, we show that infinite asymmetry is still achievable even without the\nneed of back-reflection mirrors, and we provide numerical examples of designs\nthat achieve asymmetry ratios exceeding $10^4$. The emission direction can also\nbe rapidly switched from top to bottom by tuning the wavevector or frequency.\nFurthermore, we show that with the addition of weak material absorption loss,\nsuch structures can be used to achieve perfect absorption with single-sided\nillumination, even for single-pass absorption rates less than $0.5\\%$ and\nwithout back-reflection mirrors. Our work provides new design principles for\nachieving highly directional radiation and perfect absorption in photonics.\n", "  Materials with strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC) have in recent years become a\nsubject of intense research due to their potential applications in spintronics\nand quantum information technology. In particular, in systems which break\ninversion symmetry, SOC facilitates the Rashba-Dresselhaus effect, leading to a\nlifting of spin degeneracy in the bulk and intricate spin textures of the Bloch\nwave functions. Here, by combining angular resolved photoemission (ARPES) and\nlow temperature scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) measurements with\nrelativistic first-principles band structure calculations, we examine the role\nof SOC in single crystals of noncentrosymmetric BiPd. We report the detection\nof several Dirac surface states, one of which exhibits an extremely large spin\nsplitting. Unlike the surface states in inversion-symmetric systems, the Dirac\nsurface states of BiPd have completely different properties at opposite faces\nof the crystal and are not trivially linked by symmetry. The spin-splitting of\nthe surface states exhibits a strong anisotropy by itself, which can be linked\nto the low in-plane symmetry of the surface termination.\n", "  The presence of quark-hadron phase transitions in neutron stars can be\nrelated to several interesting phenomena. In particular, previous calculations\nhave shown that fast rotating neutron stars, when subjected to a quark-hadron\nphase transition in their interiors, could give rise to the backbending\nphenomenon characterized by a spin-up era. In this work, we use an equation of\nstate composed of two phases, containing nucleons (and leptons) and quarks. The\nhadronic phase is described in a relativistic mean field formalism that takes\nmany-body forces into account, and the quark phase is described by the MIT bag\nmodel with a vector interaction. Stationary and axi-symmetric stellar models\nare obtained in a self-consistent way by solving numerically the\nEinstein-Maxwell equations by means of a pseudo-spectral method. As a result,\nwe obtain the interesting backbending phenomenon for fast spinning neutron\nstars. More importantly, we show that a magnetic field, which is assumed to be\naxi-symmetric and poloidal, can also be enhanced due to the phase transition\nfrom normal hadronic matter to quark matter on highly magnetized neutron stars.\nTherefore, in parallel to the spin-up era, classes of neutron stars endowed\nwith strong magnetic fields may go through a \"magnetic-up era\" in their lives.\n", "  We find an unambiguous relationship between disorder-driven features in the\ntemperature dependence of the resistance and the behavior, as functions of the\ntemperature, of the parameters necessary to describe some of the relaxation\nprocesses in the photoinduced differential time-resolved reflectivity of three\nsamples of Nd$_{1.83}$Ce$_{0.17}$CuO$_{4\\pm\\delta}$. The latter, sharing the\nsame Ce content, have been fabricated and annealed ad-hoc in order to differ\nonly for the degree of disorder, mainly related to oxygen content and location,\nand, consequently, for the temperature dependence of the resistance: two of\nthem present a minimum in the resistance and behave as a superconductor and as\na metal, respectively, the third behaves as an insulator. The systematic\ncoherence between the resistance and the relaxation parameters behaviors in\ntemperature for all three samples is absolutely remarkable and shows that\npump-probe measurements can be extremely sensitive to disorder as it drives the\nemergence of new excitations and of the related relaxation channels as in this\nparadigmatic case.\n", "  Graphene based photo-detecting has received great attentions and the\nperformance of such detector is stretching to both ends of high sensitivity and\nultra-fast response. However, limited by the current photo-gating mechanism,\nthe price for achieving ultra-high sensitivity is sacrificing the response\ntime. Detecting weak signal within short response time is crucial especially in\napplications such as optical positioning, remote sensing, and biomedical\nimaging. In this work, we bridge the gap between ultra-fast response and\nultra-high sensitivity by employing a graphene/SiO2/lightly-doped-Si\narchitecture with revolutionary interfacial gating mechanism. Such device is\ncapable to detect < 1 nW signal (with responsivity of ~1000 A W-1) and the\nspectral response extends from visible to near-infrared. More importantly, the\nphotoresponse time of our device has been pushed to ~400 ns. The current device\nstructure does not need complicated fabrication process and is fully compatible\nwith the silicon technology. This work will not only open up a route to\ngraphene-based high performance optoelectronic devices, but also have great\npotential in ultra-fast weak signal detection.\n", "  The solution of the Feinberg-Horodecki (FH) equation for a time-dependent\nmass (TDM) harmonic oscillator quantum system is studied. A certain interaction\nis applied to a mass to provide a particular spectrum of stationary energies.\nThe related spectrum of the harmonic oscillator potential acting on the TDM\noscillators is found. We apply the time version of the asymptotic iteration\nmethod (AIM) to calculate analytical expressions of the TDM stationary state\nenergies and their wave functions. It is shown that the obtained solutions\nreduce to those of simple harmonic oscillator as the time-dependent of the mass\nreduces to\n", "  In this paper, we study the Schottky transport in narrow-gap semiconductor\nand few-layer graphene in which the energy dispersions are highly\nnon-parabolic. We propose that the contrasting current-temperature scaling\nrelation of $J\\propto T^2$ in the conventional Schottky interface and $J\\propto\nT^3$ in graphene-based Schottky interface can be reconciled under Kane's\n$\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{p}$ non-parabolic band model for narrow-gap\nsemiconductor. Our new model suggests a more general form of $J\\propto\n\\left(T^2 + \\gamma k_BT^3 \\right)$, where the non-parabolicty parameter,\n$\\gamma$, provides a smooth transition from $T^2$ to $T^3$ scaling. For\nfew-layer graphene, it is found that $N$-layers graphene with $ABC$-stacking\nfollows $J\\propto T^{2/N+1}$ while $ABA$-stacking follows a universal form of\n$J\\propto T^3$ regardless of the number of layers. Intriguingly, the Richardson\nconstant extracted from the Arrhenius plot using an incorrect scaling relation\ndisagrees with the actual value by two orders of magnitude, suggesting that\ncorrect models must be used in order to extract important properties for many\nnovel Schottky devices.\n", "  Electronic wave functions of planar molecules can be reconstructed via\ninverse Fourier transform of angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (ARPES)\ndata, provided the phase of the electron wave in the detector plane is known.\nSince the recorded intensity is proportional to the absolute square of the\nFourier transform of the initial state wave function, information about the\nphase distribution is lost in the measurement. It was shown that the phase can\nbe retrieved in some cases by iterative algorithms using a priori information\nabout the object such as its size and symmetry. We suggest a more generalized\nand robust approach for the reconstruction of molecular orbitals based on\nstate-of-the-art phase-retrieval algorithms currently used in coherent\ndiffraction imaging. We draw an analogy between the phase problem in molecular\norbital imaging by ARPES and of that in optical coherent diffraction imaging by\nperforming an optical analogue experiment on micrometer-sized structures. We\nsuccessfully reconstruct amplitude and phase of both the micrometer-sized\nobjects and a molecular orbital from the optical and photoelectron far-field\nintensity distributions, respectively, without any prior information about the\nshape of the objects.\n", "  Dust grains are classically thought to form in the winds of asymptotic giant\nbranch (AGB) stars. However, there is increasing evidence today for dust\nformation in supernovae (SNe). To establish the relative importance of these\ntwo classes of stellar sources of dust, it is important to know the fraction of\nfreshly formed dust in SN ejecta that is able to survive the passage of the\nreverse shock and be injected in the interstellar medium. We have developed a\nnew code (GRASH\\_Rev) which follows the newly-formed dust evolution throughout\nthe supernova explosion until the merging of the forward shock with the\ncircumstellar ISM. We have considered four well studied SNe in the Milky Way\nand Large Magellanic Cloud: SN1987A, CasA, the Crab Nebula, and N49. For all\nthe simulated models, we find good agreement with observations and estimate\nthat between 1 and 8$\\%$ of the observed mass will survive, leading to a SN\ndust production rate of $(3.9 \\pm 3.7) \\times 10^{-4}$ M$_{\\odot}$yr$^{-1}$ in\nthe Milky Way. This value is one order of magnitude larger than the dust\nproduction rate by AGB stars but insufficient to counterbalance the dust\ndestruction by SNe, therefore requiring dust accretion in the gas phase.\n", "  The origins and properties of large amplitude whistler wave packets in the\nsolar wind are still unclear. In this Letter we utilise single spacecraft\nelectric and magnetic field waveform measurements from the ARTEMIS mission to\ncalculate the plasma frame frequency and wavevector of individual wave packets\nover multiple intervals. This allows direct comparison of experimental\nmeasurements with theoretical dispersion relations to identify the observed\nwaves as whistler waves. The whistlers are right-hand circularly polarised,\ntravel anti-sunward and are aligned with the background magnetic field. Their\ndispersion is strongly affected by the local electron parallel beta in\nagreement with linear theory. The properties measured are consistent with the\nelectron heat flux instability acting in the solar wind to generate these\nwaves.\n", "  We present an improved photometric redshift estimator code, CuBAN$z$, that is\npublicly available at https://goo.gl/fpk90V}{https://goo.gl/fpk90V. It uses the\nback propagation neural network along with clustering of the training set,\nwhich makes it more efficient than existing neural network codes. In CuBAN$z$,\nthe training set is divided into several self learning clusters with galaxies\nhaving similar photometric properties and spectroscopic redshifts within a\ngiven span. The clustering algorithm uses the color information (i.e. $u-g$,\n$g-r$ etc.) rather than the apparent magnitudes at various photometric bands as\nthe photometric redshift is more sensitive to the flux differences between\ndifferent bands rather than the actual values. Separate neural networks are\ntrained for each cluster using all possible colors, magnitudes and\nuncertainties in the measurements. For a galaxy with unknown redshift, we\nidentify the closest possible clusters having similar photometric properties\nand use those clusters to get the photometric redshifts using the particular\nnetworks that were trained using those cluster members. For galaxies that do\nnot match with any training cluster, the photometric redshifts are obtained\nfrom a separate network that uses entire training set. This clustering method\nenables us to determine the redshifts more accurately. SDSS Stripe 82 catalog\nhas been used here for the demonstration of the code. For the clustered sources\nwith redshift range $z_{\\rm spec}<0.7$, the residual error ($\\langle (z_{{\\rm\nspec}}-z_{{\\rm phot}})^2\\rangle^{1/2} $) in the training/testing phase is as\nlow as 0.03 compared to the existing ANNz code that provides residual error on\nthe same test data set of 0.05. Further, we provide a much better estimate of\nthe uncertainty of the derived photometric redshift.\n", "  In microvascular transport, where both blood and drug carriers are involved,\nplasma skimming has a key role on changing hematocrit level and drug carrier\nconcentration in capillary beds after continuous vessel bifurcation in the\nmicrovasculature. While there have been numerous studies on modeling the plasma\nskimming of blood, previous works lacked in consideration of its interaction\nwith drug carriers. In this paper, a generalized plasma skimming model is\nsuggested to predict the redistributions of both the cells and drug carriers at\neach bifurcation. In order to examine its applicability, this new model was\napplied on a single bifurcation system to predict the redistribution of red\nblood cells and drug carriers. Furthermore, this model was tested at\nmicrovascular network level under different plasma skimming conditions for\npredicting the concentration of drug carriers. Based on these results, the\napplicability of this generalized plasma skimming model is fully discussed and\nfuture works along with the model's limitations are summarized.\n", "  We present the stellar mass - size relation for 49 galaxies within the $z$ =\n1.067 cluster SPT-CL J0546$-$5345, with FWHM $\\sim$80-120 mas $K_{\\mathrm\ns}$-band data from the Gemini multi-conjugate adaptive optics system\n(GeMS/GSAOI). This is the first such measurement in a cluster environment,\nperformed at sub-kpc resolution at rest-frame wavelengths dominated by the\nlight of the underlying old stellar populations. The observed stellar mass -\nsize relation is offset from the local relation by 0.21 dex, corresponding to a\nsize evolution proportional to $(1+z)^{-1.25}$, consistent with the literature.\nThe slope of the stellar mass - size relation $\\beta$ = 0.74 $\\pm$ 0.06,\nconsistent with the local relation. The absence of slope evolution indicates\nthat the amount of size growth is constant with stellar mass. This suggests\nthat galaxies in massive clusters such as SPT-CL J0546$-$5345 grow via\nprocesses that increase the size without significant morphological\ninterference, such as minor mergers and/or adiabatic expansion. The slope of\nthe cluster stellar mass - size relation is significantly shallower if measured\nin $HST$/ACS imaging at wavelengths blueward of the Balmer break, similar to\nrest-frame UV relations at $z$ = 1 in the literature. The stellar mass - size\nrelation must be measured at redder wavelengths, which are more sensitive to\nthe old stellar population that dominates the stellar mass of the galaxies. The\nslope is unchanged when GeMS $K_s$-band imaging is degraded to the resolution\nof $K$-band HST/NICMOS resolution but dramatically affected when degraded to\n$K_s$-band Magellan/FourStar resolution. Such measurements must be made with AO\nin order to accurately characterise the sizes of compact, $z$ = 1 galaxies.\n", "  In what has been described as the fourth age of Quantum Chemistry,\nvariational nuclear motion programs are now routinely being used to obtain the\nvibration-rotation levels and corresponding wavefunctions of small molecules to\nthe sort of high accuracy demanded by comparison with spectroscopy. In this\nperspective I will discuss the current state-of-the-art which, for example,\nshows that these calculations are increasingly competitive with measurements\nor, indeed, replacing them and thus becoming the primary source of data on key\nprocesses. To achieve this accuracy {\\it ab initio} requires consideration\nsmall effects, routinely ignored in standard calculations, such those due to\nquantum electrodynamics (QED). Variational calculations are being used to\ngenerate huge list of transitions which provide the input for models of\nradiative transport through hot atmospheres and to fill in or even replace\nmeasured transition intensities. Future prospects such as study of molecular\nstates near dissociation, which can provide a link with low-energy chemical\nreactions, are discussed.\n", "  We report on single Barium ions confined in a near-infrared optical dipole\ntrap for up to three seconds in absence of any radio-frequency fields.\nAdditionally, the lifetime in a visible optical dipole trap is increased by two\norders of magnitude as compared to the state-of-the-art using an efficient\nrepumping method. We characterize the state-dependent potentials and measure an\nupper bound for the heating rate in the near-infrared trap. These findings are\nbeneficial for entering the regime of ultracold interaction in atom-ion\nensembles exploiting bichromatic optical dipole traps. Long lifetimes and low\nscattering rates are essential to reach long coherence times for quantum\nsimulations in optical lattices employing many ions, or ions and atoms.\n", "  We report a study of the magnetic field dependence of the photo-luminescence\nof NV$^-$ centers (negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy centers) in diamond\nsingle crystals. In such a magnetic field dependence characteristic lines are\nobserved, which are coming from Level Anti-Crossings (LACs) in the coupled\nelectron-nuclear spin system. For enhancing the sensitivity, we used lock-in\ndetection to measure the photo-luminescence intensity and observed a remarkably\nstrong dependence of the LAC-derived lines on the modulation frequency. Upon\ndecreasing of the modulation frequency from 12 kHz to 17 Hz the amplitude of\nthe lines increases by approximately two orders of magnitude. To take a\nquantitative account for such effects, we developed a theoretical model, which\ndescribes the spin dynamics in the coupled electron-nuclear spin system under\nthe action of an oscillating external magnetic field. Good agreement between\nexperiments and theory allows us to conclude that the observed effects are\noriginating from coherent spin polarization exchange in the NV$^-$ center. Our\nresults are of great practical importance allowing one to optimize the\nexperimental conditions for probing LAC-derived lines in diamond defect\ncenters.\n", "  The neutrino is the most elusive particle that we know and for many years\nphysicists doubted that neutrinos might never be revealed. Today we know and we\nreveal neutrinos produced by different astrophysical objects and by\ninteractions of cosmic rays (natural neutrinos) or produced by nuclear reactors\nand as secondary particles in accelerators (artificial neutrinos). This paper\nfocus on naturally occurring neutrinos, the disclosure of which requires\nenormous experimental apparatus in underground laboratories, under water or\nunder the ice of the South Pole. They have allowed huge advances in\nunderstanding of neutrino properties with the discovery of the oscillation\nmechanism. And at the same time they opened new frontiers for the study of\nastrophysics of the processes that produce energy inside the Sun; on the\nmechanisms leading to stellar gravitational collapses; on astrophysical objects\nthat produce cosmic rays up to extreme energies.\n", "  Objectives: To analyze the whole process involved in the production of a new\nbifocal Multizone Contact Lens (MCL) for presbyopia.\n  Methods: The optical quality of a new MCL was evaluated by ray tracing\nsoftware in a model eye with pupil different diameters with the lens centered\nand decentered. A stock of low addition (+1.5 D) MCL for presbyopia was ordered\nfor manufacturing. Power profiles were measured with a contact lens power\nmapper, processed with a custom software and compared with the theoretical\ndesign. Nine lenses from the stock were fitted to presbyopic subjects and the\nvisual performance was evaluated with new APPs for iPad Retina.\n  Results: Numerical simulations showed that the trough the focus curve\nprovided by MCL has an extended depth of focus. The optical quality was not\ndependent on pupil size and only decreased for lens decentered with a pupil\ndiameter of 4.5 mm. The manufactured MCL showed a smoothed power profile with a\nless-defined zones. The bias between experimental and theoretical zone sizes\nwas uniform along the optical zone unless for the most central area. Eyes\nfitted with the manufactured MCL showed an improvement in near Visual Acuity\n(VA) and near stereopsis. Althouh Contrast Sensitivity (CS) at distance\ndecreased, the defocus curve for contrast showed an extended depth of focus\ncorrelated to the ray tracing results.\n  Conclusions: The understanding of vision with MCL requires a process that\ninvolves design and characterization for detecting any defect that may have\nimpact in the final visual performance. Keywords: Multifocal contact lenses,\ndesign, characterization, visual performance\n", "  The purpose of this short note is to highlight a particular phenomenon which\nconcerns the Higgs branch of a certain family of 4d N = 2 theories with SO(2N)\nflavour symmetry. By studying the Higgs branch as an algebraic variety through\nHilbert series techniques we find that it is not a single hyperkahler cone but\nrather the union of two cones with intersection a hyperkahler subvariety which\nwe specify. This remarkable phenomenon is not only interesting per se but plays\na crucial role in understanding the structure of all Higgs branches that are\ngenerated by mesons.\n", "  This paper presents two new theories and a new current representation to\nexplain the magnetic force between two filamentary current elements as a result\nof electric force interactions between current charges. The first theory states\nthat a current has an electric charge relative to its moving observer. The\nsecond theory states that the magnetic force is an electric force in origin.\nThe new current representation characterizes a current as equal amounts of\npositive and negative point charges moving in opposite directions at the speed\nof light. Previous work regarded electricity and magnetism as different aspects\nof the same subject. One effort was made by Johnson to unify the origin of\nelectricity and magnetism, but this effort yielded a formula that is unequal to\nthe well-known magnetic force law. The explanation provided for the magnetic\nforce depends on three factors: 1) representing the electric current as charges\nmoving at the speed of light, 2) considering the relative velocity between\nmoving charges, and 3) analyzing the electric field spreading in the space due\nto the movement of charges inside current elements. The electric origin of the\nmagnetic force is proved by deriving the magnetic force law and Biot-Savart law\nusing the electric force law. This paper is helpful for unifying the concepts\nof magnetism and electricity.\n", "  Abell 2146 ($z$ = 0.232) consists of two galaxy clusters undergoing a major\nmerger. The system was discovered in previous work, where two large shock\nfronts were detected using the $\\textit{Chandra X-ray Observatory}$, consistent\nwith a merger close to the plane of the sky, caught soon after first core\npassage. A weak gravitational lensing analysis of the total gravitating mass in\nthe system, using the distorted shapes of distant galaxies seen with ACS-WFC on\n$\\textit{Hubble Space Telescope}$, is presented. The highest peak in the\nreconstruction of the projected mass is centred on the Brightest Cluster Galaxy\n(BCG) in Abell 2146-A. The mass associated with Abell 2146-B is more extended.\nBootstrapped noise mass reconstructions show the mass peak in Abell 2146-A to\nbe consistently centred on the BCG. Previous work showed that BCG-A appears to\nlag behind an X-ray cool core; although the peak of the mass reconstruction is\ncentred on the BCG, it is also consistent with the X-ray peak given the\nresolution of the weak lensing mass map. The best-fit mass model with two\ncomponents centred on the BCGs yields $M_{200}$ =\n1.1$^{+0.3}_{-0.4}$$\\times$10$^{15}$M$_{\\odot}$ and\n3$^{+1}_{-2}$$\\times$10$^{14}$M$_{\\odot}$ for Abell 2146-A and Abell 2146-B\nrespectively, assuming a mass concentration parameter of $c=3.5$ for each\ncluster. From the weak lensing analysis, Abell 2146-A is the primary halo\ncomponent, and the origin of the apparent discrepancy with the X-ray analysis\nwhere Abell 2146-B is the primary halo is being assessed using simulations of\nthe merger.\n", "  Colloids self-assemble into various organized superstructures determined by\nparticle interactions. There is a tremendous progress in both the scientific\nunderstanding and applications of self-assemblies of single-type identical\nparticles. Forming superstructures in which the colloidal particles occupy\npredesigned sites and remain in these sites despite thermal fluctuations\nrepresents a major challenge of the current state-of-the art. Here we propose a\nversatile approach to direct placement of colloids using nematic liquid\ncrystals with spatially varying molecular orientation pre-imposed by substrate\nphotoalignment. Colloidal particles in nematic environment are subject to the\nlong-range elastic forces originating in the orientational order of the\nnematic. Gradients of the orientational order create an elastic energy\nlandscape that drives the colloids into locations with preferred type of\ndeformations. As an example, we demonstrate that colloidal spheres with\nperpendicular surface anchoring are driven into the regions of maximum splay,\nwhile spheres with tangential surface anchoring settle into the regions of\nbend. Elastic forces responsible for preferential placement are measured by\nexploring overdamped dynamics of the colloids. Control of colloidal\nself-assembly through patterned molecular orientation opens new opportunities\nfor design of materials and devices in which particles should be placed in\npre-designed locations.\n", "  We summarize the progress in neutrino astrophysics and emphasize open issues\nin our understanding of neutrino flavor conversion in media. We discuss solar\nneutrinos, core-collapse supernova neutrinos and conclude with ultra-high\nenergy neutrinos.\n", "  Accurate $EF{}^1\\Sigma^+_g-X{}^1\\Sigma^+_g$ transition energies in molecular\nhydrogen were determined for transitions originating from levels with\nhighly-excited vibrational quantum number, $v=11$, in the ground electronic\nstate. Doppler-free two-photon spectroscopy was applied on vibrationally\nexcited H$_2^*$, produced via the photodissociation of H$_2$S, yielding\ntransition frequencies with accuracies of $45$ MHz or $0.0015$ cm$^{-1}$. An\nimportant improvement is the enhanced detection efficiency by resonant\nexcitation to autoionizing $7p\\pi$ electronic Rydberg states, resulting in\nnarrow transitions due to reduced ac-Stark effects. Using known $EF$ level\nenergies, the level energies of $X(v=11, J=1,3-5)$ states are derived with\naccuracies of typically 0.002 cm$^{-1}$. These experimental values are in\nexcellent agreement with, and are more accurate than the results obtained from\nthe most advanced ab initio molecular theory calculations including\nrelativistic and QED contributions.\n", "  In this work we demonstrate single microparticle transport enabled by noise\nin a one dimensional optical lattice with periodic symmetric potentials and a\nsmall constant external force. The one dimensional lattice is implemented by\nsix focused beams with holographic optical tweezers, where a microparticle is\ntrapped in three dimensions. Transport initiates when dynamical disorder is\nadded to the diffracted laser power at each trap ($\\pm 30\\%$) at a fixed\nfrequency (0 to 35 Hz), while the direction of motion is set by the constant\nexternal force. We find that transport is only achieved within a narrow noise\nfrequency range, which is consistent with simulations, and the predicted\nbehavior and observations of noise-induced energy transport in quantum and\nclassical systems. To our knowledge this is the first direct observation of\nnoise-assisted transport in a colloidal system.\n", "  Shunting inhibitory cellular neural networks (SICNNs) with continuous as well\nas discontinuous external inputs are investigated. The descriptions of\nhomoclinic and heteroclinic motions are provided in the functional sense for\nthe multidimensional dynamics of SICNNs, and it is demonstrated that the\nnetworks under investigation exhibit such motions. Homoclinic and heteroclinic\noutputs that are asymptotic to quasi-periodic outputs are illustrated.\n", "  The two dimensional BTW model of SOC, with probabilistically nonuniform\ndistribution of particles among the nearest neighbouring sites, is studied by\ncomputer simulation. When the value of height variable of a particular site\nreaches the critical value (z c = 4), the value of height variable of that site\nis reduced by four units by distributing four particles among the four nearest\nneighbouring sites. In this paper, it is considered that, two particles are\ndistributed equally among the two nearest neighbouring sites along X-axis.\nHowever, the distribution of other two particles along Y- axis, is\nprobabilistically nonuniform. The variation of spatial average of the height\nvariable with time is studied. In the SOC state, the distribution of avalanche\nsizes and durations is obtained. The total number of topplings occured during\nthe stipulated time of evolution is also calculated.\n", "  We provide an update on a long-term project that aims at evaluating massive\nvacuum integrals at the five-loop frontier, with high precision and in various\nspace-time dimensions. A number of applications are sketched, mainly concerning\nthe determination of anomalous dimensions, for quantum field theories in four,\nthree and two dimensions.\n", "  We investigate the time evolution of statistical properties of a single mode\nradiation field after its interaction with a two-level atom. The entire system\nis described by a dispersive Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian assuming the atomic\nstate evolving from an initial superposition of its excited and ground states,\n$\\vert e\\rangle +\\vert g\\rangle ,$ and the field evolving from an initial\nsuperposition of two excited levels, $\\vert n_{1}\\rangle+ \\vert n_{2}\\rangle$.\nIt is found that the field evolution is periodic, the period depending on the\nratio $n_{2}/n_{1}.$ The energy excitation oscillates between these two states\nand the statististics can be either sub- or super-Poissonian, depending on the\nvalues $n_{1},$ $n_{2}$.\n", "  In this paper we discuss the development of a fast and accurate waveform\nmodel for the quasi-circular orbital evolution of extreme-mass-ratio-inspirals\n(EMRIs). This model simply employs the data of a few numerical Teukoulsky-based\nenergy fluxes and waveforms to fit out a set of polynomials for the entire\nfluxes and waveforms. These obtained polynomials are accurate enough in the\nentire evolution domain, and much more accurate than the resummation\npost-Newtonian (PN) energy fluxes and waveforms, especially when the spin of a\nblack hole becomes large. The dynamical equation we adopted for orbital\nrevolution is the effective-one-body (EOB) formalism. Because of the simplified\nexpressions, the efficiency of calculating the orbital evolution with our\npolynomials is also better than the traditional method which uses the resummed\nPN analytical fluxes. Our model should be useful in calculation of waveform\ntemplates of EMRIs for the gravitational wave detectors such as the evolved\nLaser Interferometer Space Antenna (eLISA).\n", "  Nonlinear wave mixing in mesoscopic silicon structures is a fundamental\nnonlinear process with broad impact and applications. Silicon nanowire\nwaveguides, in particular, have large third-order Kerr nonlinearity, enabling\nsalient and abundant four-wave-mixing dynamics and functionalities. Besides the\nKerr effect, in silicon waveguides two-photon absorption generates high\nfree-carrier densities, with corresponding fifth-order nonlinearity in the\nforms of free-carrier dispersion and free-carrier absorption. However, whether\nthese fifth-order free-carrier nonlinear effects can lead to six-wave-mixing\ndynamics still remains an open question until now. Here we report the\ndemonstration of free-carrier-induced six-wave mixing in silicon nanowires.\nUnique features, including inverse detuning dependence of six-wave-mixing\nefficiency and its higher sensitivity to pump power, are originally observed\nand verfied by analytical prediction and numerical modeling. Additionally,\nasymmetric sideband generation is observed for different laser detunings,\nresulting from the phase-sensitive interactions between free-carrier\nsix-wave-mixing and Kerr four-wave-mixing dynamics. These discoveries provide a\nnew path for nonlinear multi-wave interactions in nanoscale platforms.\n", "  We present the high-temperature expansion up to 11th order for the specific\nheat $C$ and the uniform susceptibility $\\chi_0$ and up to 9th order for the\nstructure factor $S_{\\bf Q}$ of the frustrated spin-half $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg\nmodel on the BCC lattice. We consider ferromagnetic as well as\nantiferromagnetic nearest-neighbor exchange $J_1$ and frustrating\nantiferromagnetic next-nearest-neighbor exchange $J_2$. We discuss the\ninfluence of frustration on the temperature dependence of these quantities.\nFurthermore, we use the HTE series to determine the critical temperature $T_c$\nas a function of the frustration parameter $J_2$.\n", "  Autocatalytic fibril nucleation has recently been proposed to be a\ndetermining factor for the spread of neurodegenerative diseases, but the same\nprocess could also be exploited to amplify minute quantities of protein\naggregates in a diagnostic context. Recent advances in microfluidic technology\nallow analysis of protein aggregation in micron-scale samples potentially\nenabling such diagnostic approaches, but the theoretical foundations for the\nanalysis and interpretation of such data are so far lacking. Here we study\ncomputationally the onset of protein aggregation in small volumes and show that\nthe process is ruled by intrinsic fluctuations whose volume dependent\ndistribution we also estimate theoretically. Based on these results, we develop\na strategy to quantify in silico the statistical errors associated with the\ndetection of aggregate containing samples. Our work opens a new perspective on\nthe forecasting of protein aggregation in asymptomatic subjects.\n", "  Collagen networks provide the main structural component of most tissues and\nrepresent an important ingredient for bio-mimetic materials for bio-medical\napplications. Here we study the mechanical properties of stiff collagen\nnetworks derived from three different echinoderms and show that they exhibit\nnon-linear stiffening followed by brittle fracture. The disordered nature of\nthe network leads to strong sample-to-sample fluctuations in elasticity and\nfracture strength. We perform numerical simulations of a three dimensional\nmodel for the deformation of a cross-linked elastic fibril network which is\nable to reproduce the macroscopic features of the experimental results and\nprovide insights into the internal mechanics of stiff collagen networks. Our\nnumerical model provides an avenue for the design of collagen membranes with\ntunable mechanical properties.\n", "  We analyze the temperature dependence of conductivity in thick granular\nferromagnetic compounds NiSiO2 and in thin weakly coupled films of Fe, Ni and\nPy in vicinity of metal-insulator transition. Development of resistivity\nminimum followed by a logarithmic variation of conductivity at lower\ntemperatures is attributed to granular structure of compounds and thin films\nfabricated by conventional deposition techniques. Resistivity minimum is\nidentified as a transition between temperature dependent intra-granular\nmetallic conductance and thermally activated inter-granular tunneling.\n", "  We review the studies of transitions and decays of bottomonium states from\nthe e+ e- data recorded by the Belle detector at various Upsilon-resonances. We\nalso report a recent study of the branching fractions of \\chi_{bJ}(1P) to 41\nhadronic final states in the Y(2S) data sample. In the same study, a 90%\nconfidence-level upper limit is set for the first time on the width of\n\\chi_{b0}(1P) at \\Gamma_{total} < 2.4 MeV.\n", "  The paper presents a new approach, based on controlled oxidation of nanoscale\nmetallic multilayers, to produce strong and hard oxide/metal nanocomposite\ncoatings with high strength and good thermal stability. The approach is\ndemonstrated by performing long term annealing on sputtered Zr/Nb nanoscale\nmetallic multilayers and investigating the evolution of their microstructure\nand mechanical properties by combining analytical transmission electron\nmicroscopy, nano-mechanical tests and finite element models. As-deposited\nmultilayers were annealed at 350 C in air for times ranging between 1 - 336\nhours. The elastic modulus increased by approx. 20% and the hardness by approx.\n42% after 15 hours of annealing. Longer annealing times did not lead to changes\nin hardness, although the elastic modulus increased up to 35% after 336 hrs.\nThe hcp Zr layers were rapidly transformed into monoclinic ZrO2 (in the first\n15 hours), while the Nb layers were progressively oxidised, from top surface\ndown towards the substrate, to form an amorphous oxide phase at a much lower\nrate. The sequential oxidation of Zr and Nb layers was key for the oxidation to\ntake place without rupture of the multi-layered structure and without coating\nspallation, as the plastic deformation of the metallic Nb layers allowed for\nthe partial relieve of the residual stresses developed as a result of the\nvolumetric expansion of the Zr layers upon oxidation. Moreover, the development\nof residual stresses induced further changes in mechanical properties in\nrelation to the annealing time, as revealed by finite element simulations.\n", "  In planetary science, surface roughness is regarded to be a measure of\nsurface irregularity at small spatial scales, and causes the thermal-infrared\nbeaming effect (i.e. re-radiation of absorbed sunlight back towards to the\nSun). Typically, surface roughness exhibits a degeneracy with thermal inertia\nwhen thermophysical models are fitted to disc-integrated thermal-infrared\nobservations of asteroids because of this effect. In this work, it is\ndemonstrated how surface roughness can be constrained for near-Earth asteroid\n(433) Eros (i.e. the target of NASA's NEAR Shoemaker mission) when using the\nAdvanced Thermophysical Model with thermal-infrared observations taken during\nan \"almost pole-on\" illumination and viewing geometry. It is found that the\nsurface roughness of (433) Eros is characterised by an RMS slope of 38 $\\pm$\n8{\\deg} at the 0.5-cm spatial scale associated with its thermal-infrared\nbeaming effect. This is slightly greater than the RMS slope of 25 $\\pm$ 5{\\deg}\nimplied by the NEAR Shoemaker laser ranging results when extrapolated to this\nspatial scale, and indicates that other surface shaping processes might\noperate, in addition to collisions and gravity, at spatial scales under one\nmetre in order to make asteroid surfaces rougher. For other high obliquity\nasteroids observed during \"pole-on\" illumination conditions, the\nthermal-infrared beaming effect allows surface roughness to be constrained when\nthe sub-solar latitude is greater than 60{\\deg}, and if the asteroids are\nobserved at phase angles of less than 40{\\deg}. They will likely exhibit NEATM\nbeaming parameters that are lower than expected for a typical asteroid at all\nphase angles up to 100{\\deg}.\n", "  We study cosmological field configurations (solutions) in a model in which\nthe pseudo-scalar phase of a complex field couples to the Pontryagin density of\na massive non-abelian gauge field, in analogy to how the Peccei-Quinn axion\nfield couples to the $SU(3)$-color gauge field of QCD. Assuming that the\nself-interaction potential of the complex scalar field has the typical {\\it\nMexican hat} form, we find that the radial fluctuations of this field can act\nas {\\it Dark Matter}, while its phase may give rise to tracking {\\it Dark\nEnergy}. In our model, Dark-Energy domination will, however, not continue for\never. A new component of dark matter, namely the one originating from the gauge\nfield, will dominate in the future.\n", "  The current work addresses quantum machine learning in the context of Quantum\nArtificial Neural Networks such that the networks' processing is divided in two\nstages: the learning stage, where the network converges to a specific quantum\ncircuit, and the backpropagation stage where the network effectively works as a\nself-programing quantum computing system that selects the quantum circuits to\nsolve computing problems. The results are extended to general architectures\nincluding recurrent networks that interact with an environment, coupling with\nit in the neural links' activation order, and self-organizing in a dynamical\nregime that intermixes patterns of dynamical stochasticity and persistent\nquasiperiodic dynamics, making emerge a form of noise resilient dynamical\nrecord.\n", "  We study a one-dimensional quasiperiodic system described by the off-diagonal\nAubry-Andr\\'{e} model and investigate its phase diagram by using the symmetry\nand the multifractal analysis. It was shown in a recent work ({\\it Phys. Rev.\nB} {\\bf 93}, 205441 (2016)) that its phase diagram was divided into three\nregions, dubbed the extended, the topologically-nontrivial localized and the\ntopologically-trivial localized phases, respectively. Out of our expectation,\nwe find an additional region of the extended phase which can be mapped into the\noriginal one by a symmetry transformation. More unexpectedly, in both\n\"localized\" phases, most of the eigenfunctions are neither localized nor\nextended. Instead, they display critical features, that is, the minimum of the\nsingularity spectrum is in a range $0<\\gamma_{min}<1$ instead of $0$ for the\nlocalized state or $1$ for the extended state. Thus, a mixed phase is found\nwith a mixture of localized and critical eigenfunctions.\n", "  In the deformed quantum mechanics with a minimal length, one WKB connection\nformula through a turning point is derived. We then use it to calculate\ntunnelling rates through potential barriers under the WKB approximation.\nFinally, the minimal length effects on two examples of quantum tunneling in\nnuclear and atomic physics are discussed\n", "  Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) beams reflected from a multi-layered dielectric\nexperience a shift in their centroid that is different than that from a single\ninterface. This has been previously investigated for linearly polarized beams\nand, to a much lesser extent, beams with spin angular momentum. Here a\ncombination of perturbation and computational analyses is used to provide a\nunified quantification of these shifts in layered dielectrics with two parallel\ninterfaces. The approach is then extended to consider the qualitatively new\nbehavior that results when the light is endowed with an intrinsic orbital\nangular momentum--i.e. vortex beams. Destructive interference causes singular\nlateral shifts in the centroid of the reflected vortex beam for which spin\nalone produces only a mild modulation. In the case of total internal\nreflection, both spin and intrinsic orbital angular momentum contribute to an\nenhancement of these lateral shifts as the interlayer thickness is decreased.\nThis is just the opposite of the trend associated with longitudinal shifts. Two\ngeometries are considered: air/glass/air and glass/air/glass multi-layers. A\ncommonly available glass is used to show that vortex beams can result in\ncentroid shifts on the order of microns for beams with a significant reflection\ncoefficient.\n", "  In recent paper (Goloveshkin and Myagkov 2014) we proposed a two-dimensional\nenergy-based model of fragmentation of rapidly expanding cylinder under plane\nstrain conditions. The model allowed one to estimate the average fragment\nlength and the number of fragments produced by ductile fracture of the\ncylinder. In present note we show that the proposed approach can be used to\nestimate the number of fragments in a problem of fragmentation of an expanding\nring.\n", "  Advances in understanding chemical and physical driving forces in\nself-assembly allow the fabrication of unique nanoarchitectures with\nsubwavelength building blocks as the basis for plasmonic and metamaterial\ndevices. Chemical crosslinking of colloidal nanospheres has produced among the\nsmallest gap spacings, necessary to obtain regions of greatly enhanced electric\nfield, hotspots, which are critical to tailor light-matter interactions.\nHowever, obtaining uniform electromagnetic response of dense nanoantennas over\nlarge area for use in devices remains challenging. In this work,\nelectrohydrodynamic (EHD) flow and chemical crosslinking is combined to form\ndense, yet discrete, Au nanosphere clusters (oligomers) on a working electrode.\nEHD provides a long range driving force to bring nanospheres together and\nanhydride crosslinking yields 0.9 nm gap spacings. Using selective chemistry,\nnanospheres are simultaneously crosslinked onto a block copolymer template,\nproducing oligomers with a narrower wavelength band width and higher hotspot\nintensity than monolayer structures produced without a template. We investigate\nnanoantenna response via full wave simulations, ultraviolet-visible\nspectroscopy, and surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS). Nanoantennas\nexhibit uniform hotspot intensity and gap spacing. Simulations show field\nenhancements of 600, correlating well with measured average SERS enhancement of\n1.4x10^9. Nanoantenna substrates produce a SERS signal with a relative standard\ndeviation of 10% measured over a 1 mm2 area, crucial for nano-optical devices\nsuch as optical sensors, among other applications. Understanding long range\n(EHD flow) and short range (chemical crosslinking) driving forces provides the\ncontrol for assembling colloidal nanoparticles in architectures for large area\nplasmonic and metasurface device fabrication.\n", "  Networks of elastic beams can deform either by stretching or bending of their\nmembers. The primary mode of deformation (bending or stretching) crucially\ndepends on the specific details of the network architecture. In order to shed\nlight on the relationship between microscopic geometry and macroscopic\nmechanics, we characterize the structural features of networks which deform\nuniformly, through the stretching of the beams only. We provide a convenient\nset of geometrical criteria to identify such networks, and derive the values of\ntheir effective elastic moduli. The analysis of these criteria elucidates the\nvariability of mechanical response of elastic networks. In particular, our\nstudy rationalizes the difference in mechanical behavior of cellular and fiber\nnetworks.\n", "  Recently, liquid-phase crystallization of thin silicon films has emerged as a\npromising candidate for thin-film photovoltaics. On 10 \\mu m thin absorbers,\nwafer-equivalent morphologies and open-circuit voltages were reached, leading\nto a record efficiency of 12.1%. However, short-circuit current densities are\nstill limited, mainly due to optical losses at the glass-silicon interface.\nWhile nano-structures at this interface have been shown to efficiently reduce\nreflection, up to now these textures caused an increase in recombination.\nTherefore, optical gains were mitigated due to electronic losses. Here, the\nSMooth Anti-Reflective Three-dimensional (SMART) texture is introduced in order\nto overcome this trade-off. By smoothing nanoimprinted SiOx nano-pillar arrays\nwith spin-coated TiOx layers, light-trapping properties of laser-crystallized\nsilicon solar cells could significantly be improved as successfully shown in\nthree-dimensional simulations and in experiment. At the same time, the smooth\nsurface morphology of SMART textures allows preserving electronic material\nquality equivalent to that of planar reference samples and reaching Voc values\nabove 640 mV in 8 \\mu m thin liquid-phase crystallized silicon solar cells.\nFurthermore, the short-circuit current density jsc could be increased from 21.0\nmA cm-2 for planar reference cells with already optimized anti-reflective\ninterlayer stacks to 23.3 mA cm-2 on SMART textures, corresponding to a\nrelative increase of 11%.\n", "  In recent work, Renaud, Venaille, and Bouchet (RVB) revisit the equilibrium\nstatistical mechanics theory of the shallow water equations, within a\nmicrocanonical approach, focusing on a more careful treatment of the energy\npartition between inertial gravity wave and eddy motions in the equilibrium\nstate, and deriving joint probability distributions for the corresponding\ndynamical degrees of freedom. The authors derive a Liouville theorem that\ndetermines the underlying phase space statistical measure, but then, through\nsome physical arguments, actually compute the equilibrium statistics using a\nmeasure that \\emph{violates} this theorem. Here, using a more convenient, but\nessentially equivalent, grand canonical approach, the full statistical theory\nconsistent with the Liouville theorem is derived. The results reveal several\nsignificant differences from the previous results: (1) The microscale wave\nmotions lead to a strongly fluctuating thermodynamics, including long-ranged\ncorrelations, in contrast to the mean-field-like behavior found by RVB. The\nfinal effective model is equivalent to that of an elastic membrane with a\nnonlinear wave-renormalized surface tension. (2) Even when a mean field\napproximation is made, a rather more complex joint probability distribution is\nrevealed. Alternative physical arguments fully support the consistency of the\nresults. Of course, the true fluid final steady state relies on dissipative\nprocesses not included in the shallow water equations, such as wave breaking\nand viscous effects, but it is argued that the current theory provides a more\nmathematically consistent starting point for future work aimed at assessing\ntheir impacts.\n", "  We study the flow of a generalized Newtonian fluid, characterized by a\npower-law model, through a channel consisting of a wall with a flexible\nmembrane under longitudinal tension. It is assumed that at steady state the\nflow through the channel admits a constant flux unidirectional flow profile,\nwhile for the unsteady case, we employ the long wave approximation and use a\nset of reduced equations to describe the variation of the shape of the membrane\n(assumed to be massless and elastic) and the variation of the fluid-flux. By\nmeans of asymptotic expansion, multiscale analysis and full numerical solutions\nof the pertinent governing equations, we show that depending upon the Reynolds\nnumber and the membrane stress, the flow behaviour for a shear-thinning,\nshear-thickening and Newtonian fluid may be markedly different, being\noscillatory for one while chaotic for the other. The results presented herein\nhold practical relevance for several biologically relevant processes involving\ntransport of rheologically complex biofluids through flexible domains.\n", "  A short review of the currently available modern parton distribution\nfunctions (PDFs)and the theory predictions obtained using those PDFs for\nseveral benchmark processes at LHC, including Higgs boson production, is\npresented in this write-up. It includes the discussion on theory assumptions\nmade in the determination procedure of PDFs and an impact on the differences in\nthe obtained predictions, followed by the alternative to PDF4LHC\nrecommendations for the usage of PDF sets for theory predictions at the LHC.\n", "  Single walled carbon nanotubes of 2 nm diameter and 3 to 13 micro meter\nlength were compressed in Cu bullets and irradiated with positive ions of Cs\nwith energies from 0.2 to 2.0 keV and subjected to successively increasing Cs\ndose. From the mass spectra of the sputtered carbon atoms and clusters as a\nfunction of Cs energy the monitoring of trend of the relative number densities\nof the fragmenting species indicates the accumulating damage. Irradiation\ninduced fragmentation provide clues to the structural changes as a result of\ncreation of vacancies due to the sputtering of monatomic, diatomic, triatomic\nand higher species. Monitoring of the the irradiated target electrical\nconductivity provides information of the sequences of the transformation that\nmay be occurring in the structures of the single walled carbon nanotube as a\nfunction of Cs energy and dose.\n", "  This study focuses on heat and mass exchange processes in hydrate foam during\nits formation from methane bubbles in gas hydrate stability zone (GHSZ) of the\nLake Baikal and following delivery of it in open container to the lake surface.\nThe foam was formed as a result of methane bubble collection with a\ntrap/container. The trap was inverted glass beaker of diameter of 70 mm and 360\nmm long. Open bottom end of the beaker used as enter for bubbles ascended from\nthe lakebed. At a depth of 1400 m all bubbles which fed to the trap were\ntransformed here into solid hydrate foam. The sensitive thermometer was mounted\nin the middle of the trap and recorded the temperature inside trap. The fate of\nthe bubbles in the trap was recorded by video-camera. During ascend within GHSZ\nwith velocity of about 0.375 m/s we observed the continuous decrease of the\ntemperature in the foam up to a level of negative magnitude in a depth interval\nof 1400 - 750 meters. Above 750 m temperature decrease was changed by small\ngrowth. However once the trap ascended above top boundary of GHSZ at a depth of\n380 m, the temperature fell sharply. Falling to a negative values -0.25 oC, the\ntemperature sharply stabilized and did not changed further until the trap\nreached the surface. The decreasing of the temperature during the ascent is due\nto the cooling of gas as a result of the performing of the work against the\nforces of hydrostatic pressure. The temperature drop at the boundary of the\nGHSZ is due to the absorption of heat by the decomposition of hydrate.\n", "  We present a new method to reconstruct the primordial (linear) density field\nusing the estimated nonlinear displacement field. The divergence of the\ndisplacement field gives the reconstructed density field. We solve the\nnonlinear displacement field in the 1D cosmology and show the reconstruction\nresults. The new reconstruction algorithm recovers a lot of linear modes and\nreduces the nonlinear damping scale significantly. The successful 1D\nreconstruction results imply the new algorithm should also be a promising\ntechnique in the 3D case.\n", "  When recovering an unknown signal from noisy measurements, the computational\ndifficulty of performing optimal Bayesian MMSE (minimum mean squared error)\ninference often necessitates the use of maximum a posteriori (MAP) inference, a\nspecial case of regularized M-estimation, as a surrogate. However, MAP is\nsuboptimal in high dimensions, when the number of unknown signal components is\nsimilar to the number of measurements. In this work we demonstrate, when the\nsignal distribution and the likelihood function associated with the noise are\nboth log-concave, that optimal MMSE performance is asymptotically achievable\nvia another M-estimation procedure. This procedure involves minimizing convex\nloss and regularizer functions that are nonlinearly smoothed versions of the\nwidely applied MAP optimization problem. Our findings provide a new heuristic\nderivation and interpretation for recent optimal M-estimators found in the\nsetting of linear measurements and additive noise, and further extend these\nresults to nonlinear measurements with non-additive noise. We numerically\ndemonstrate superior performance of our optimal M-estimators relative to MAP.\nOverall, at the heart of our work is the revelation of a remarkable equivalence\nbetween two seemingly very different computational problems: namely that of\nhigh dimensional Bayesian integration underlying MMSE inference, and high\ndimensional convex optimization underlying M-estimation. In essence we show\nthat the former difficult integral may be computed by solving the latter,\nsimpler optimization problem.\n", "  Dynamics of vortex clusters is essential for understanding diverse superfluid\nphenomena. In this paper, we examine the dynamics of vortex quadrupoles in a\ntrapped two-dimensional (2D) Bose-Einstein condensate. We find that the\nmovement of these vortex-clusters fall into three distinct regimes which are\nfully described by the radial positions of the vortices in a 2D isotropic\nharmonic trap, or by the major radius (minor radius) of the elliptical\nequipotential lines decided by the vortex positions in a 2D anisotropic\nharmonic trap. In the \"recombination\" and \"exchange\" regimes the quadrupole\nstructure maintains, while the vortices annihilate each other permanently in\nthe \"annihilation\" regime. We find that the mechanism of the charge flipping in\nthe \"exchange\" regime and the disappearance of the quadrupole structure in the\n\"annihilation\" regime are both through an intermediate state where two vortex\ndipoles connected through a soliton ring. We give the parameter ranges for\nthese three regimes in coordinate space for a specific initial configuration\nand phase diagram of the vortex positions with respect to the Thomas-Fermi\nradius of the condensate. We show that the results are also applicable to\nsystems with quantum fluctuations for the short-time evolution.\n", "  The neutrino mass generation mechanism, the nature of dark matter and the\norigin of the baryon asymmetry of the Universe are three compelling questions\nthat cannot be accounted for in the Standard Model of particle physics. In this\nthesis we focus on all these issues by providing a possible solution in terms\nof a minimal extension of the Standard Model, consisting in the addition of a\nset of sterile fermions to the field content of the theory. Sterile fermions\nare gauge singlet fields, that can interact via mixing with the active\nneutrinos. We focus on the Inverse Seesaw mechanism, which is characterised by\na low (TeV or lower) new physics scale and that can be tested in current and\nfuture experimental facilities. We present the model building analysis that\npoints towards the minimal realisations of the mechanism, and the\nphenomenological study in order to accommodate light neutrino masses and to\nimpose all the relevant experimental constraints in the model, as well as the\nexpected experimental signatures. We show the viability of the sterile neutrino\nhypothesis as dark matter component, together with the characteristic features\nof this scenario in the minimal Inverse Seesaw mechanism. The possibility of\nsuccessfully accounting for the baryon asymmetry in a testable realisation of\nthe leptogenesis mechanism is also addressed. On the other hand it is important\nto look for manifestations of sterile fermions in laboratory experiments. We\naddress this point by making predictions for the expected rates of rare lepton\nnumber violating decays of vector bosons, that can be mediated by sterile\nfermions, as well as by studying the impact of sterile fermions on global fit\nof electroweak precision data.\n", "  Wigner's little groups are subgroups of the Lorentz group dictating the\ninternal space-time symmetries of massive and massless particles. These little\ngroups are like O(3) and E(2) for massive and massless particles respectively.\nWhile the geometry of the O(3) symmetry is familiar to us, the geometry of the\nflat plane cannot explain the E(2)-like symmetry for massless particles.\nHowever, the geometry of a circular cylinder can explain the symmetry with the\nhelicity and gauge degrees of freedom. It is shown further that the symmetry of\nthe massless particle can be obtained as a zero-mass limit of O(3)-like\nsymmetry for massive particles. It is shown further that the polarization of\nmassless neutrinos is a consequence of gauge invariance, while the symmetry of\nmassive neutrinos is still like O(3).\n", "  SAO244567 is a rare example of a star that allows us to witness stellar\nevolution in real time. Between 1971 and 1990 it changed from a B-type star\ninto the hot central star of the Stingray Nebula. This observed rapid heating\nhas been a mystery for decades, since it is in strong contradiction with the\nlow mass of the star and canonical post-asymptotic giant branch (AGB)\nevolution. We speculated that SAO244567 might have suffered from a late thermal\npulse (LTP) and obtained new observations with HST/COS to follow the evolution\nof the surface properties of SAO244567 and to verify the LTP hypothesis. Our\nnon-LTE spectral analysis reveals that the star cooled significantly since 2002\nand that its envelope is now expanding. Therefore, we conclude that SAO244567\nis currently on its way back towards the AGB, which strongly supports the LTP\nhypothesis. A comparison with state-of-the-art LTP evolutionary calculations\nshows that these models cannot fully reproduce the evolution of all surface\nparameters simultaneously, pointing out possible shortcomings of stellar\nevolution models. Thereby, SAO244567 keeps on challenging stellar evolution\ntheory and we highly encourage further investigations.\n", "  A simple proof of Bekenstein-Mukhanov(BM) ansatz is given within the loop\nquantum gravity(LQG) framework. The macroscopic area of an equilibrium black\nhole horizon indeed manifests a linear quantization. The quantum number\nresponsible for this discreteness of the macroscopic area has a physical\nmeaning in the LQG framework, unlike the ad hoc one that remained unexplained\nin BM ansatz.\n", "  We identify the main actors in the Isabelle and Coq communities and describe\nhow they affect and influence their peers. This work explores selected\nfoundations of social networking analysis that we expect to be useful in the\ncontext of the ProofPeer project, which is developing a new model for\ninteractive theorem proving based on collaboration and social interactions.\n", "  We present an updated optical and mechanical design of NEWS: the\nNear-infrared Echelle for Wide-band Spectroscopy (formerly called HiJaK: the\nHigh-resolution J, H and K spectrometer), a compact, high-resolution,\nnear-infrared spectrometer for 5-meter class telescopes. NEWS provides a\nspectral resolution of 60,000 and covers the full 0.8-2.5 micron range in 5\nmodes.
