Such functionality leads to new security paradigms that are\nnot possible in classical communication networks. Key to these new security\nparadigms are quantum protocols that can unconditionally determine that a\nreceiver is in fact at an a priori assigned location. A limiting factor of such\nquantum protocols will be the decoherence of states held in quantum memory.\nHere we investigate the performance of quantum location verification protocols\nunder decoherence effects. More specifically, we address the issue of how\ndecoherence impacts the verification using N = 2 qubits entangled as Bell\nstates, as compared to N > 2 qubits entangled as GHZ states. We study the\noriginal quantum location verification protocol, as well as a variant protocol,\nintroduced here, which utilizes teleportation. We find that the performance of\nquantum location verification is in fact similar for Bell states and some N > 2\nGHZ states, even though quantum decoherence degrades larger-qubit entanglements\nfaster. Our results are important for the design and implementation of\nlocation-dependent communications in emerging quantum networks.\n", "  We construct three-dimensional families of small-amplitude gravity-driven\nrotational steady water waves on finite depth. The solutions contain\ncounter-currents and multiple crests in each minimal period. Each such wave\ngenerically is a combination of three different Fourier modes, giving rise to a\nrich and complex variety of wave patterns. The bifurcation argument is based on\na blow-up technique, taking advantage of three parameters associated with the\nvorticity distribution, the strength of the background stream, and the period\nof the wave.\n", "  Charge stripe order has recently been established as an important ingredient\nof the physics of cuprate high-T$_c$ superconductors. However, due to the\ncomplex interplay between competing phases and the influence of disorder, it is\nunclear how it emerges from the parent metallic state. Here we report on the\ndiscovery of an unconventional electronic ordered phase between charge-stripe\norder and (pseudogapped) metal in the cuprate La$_{2-x-y}$Eu$_{y}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$\nwith $y = 0.2$ (LESCO). The peculiar properties of the intermediate phase are\nrevealed through three complementary experiments: nuclear quadrupole resonance,\nnonlinear conductivity, and specific heat. We demonstrate that the order\nappears through a sharp phase transition, and exists in a dome-shaped region of\nthe phase diagram, similar to charge stripes. A comparison to recent\ntheoretical work shows that the order is a state without broken translational\nsymmetry -- a charge nematic. We thus resolve the complex process of charge\nstripe development in cuprates, show that the nematic phase is unrelated to\nhigh-temperature pseudogap physics, and establish a link with other strongly\ncorrelated electronic materials where nematic order is prominent.\n", "  Chirality is a universal feature in nature, as observed in fermion\ninteractions and DNA helicity. Much attention has been given to chiral\ninteractions of light, not only regarding its physical interpretation but also\nfocusing on intriguing phenomena in excitation, absorption, refraction, and\ntopological phase. Although recent progress in metamaterials has spurred\nartificial engineering of chirality, most approaches are founded on the same\nprinciple of the mixing of electric and magnetic responses. Here we propose\nnonmagnetic chiral interactions of light based on low-dimensional eigensystems.\nExploiting the mixing of amplifying and decaying electric modes in a complex\nmaterial, the low-dimensionality in polarization space having a chiral\neigenstate is realized, in contrast to 2-dimensional eigensystems in previous\napproaches. The existence of optical spin black hole from low-dimensional\nchirality is predicted, and singular interactions between chiral waves are\nconfirmed experimentally in parity-time-symmetric metamaterials.\n", "  We show that every n-dimensional locally homogeneous pp-wave is a plane wave,\nprovided it is indecomposable and its curvature operator, when acting on\n$2$-forms, has rank greater than one. As a consequence we obtain that\nindecomposable, Ricci-flat locally homogeneous pp-waves are plane waves. This\ngeneralises a classical result by Jordan, Ehlers and Kundt in dimension 4.\nSeveral examples show that our assumptions on indecomposability and the rank of\nthe curvature are essential.\n", "  It is well known that the water-wave problem with weak surface tension has\nsmall-amplitude line solitary-wave solutions which to leading order are\ndescribed by the nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation. The present paper contains\nan existence theory for three-dimensional periodically modulated solitary-wave\nsolutions which have a solitary-wave profile in the direction of propagation\nand are periodic in the transverse direction; they emanate from the line\nsolitary waves in a dimension-breaking bifurcation. In addition, it is shown\nthat the line solitary waves are linearly unstable to long-wavelength\ntransverse perturbations. The key to these results is a formulation of the\nwater wave problem as an evolutionary system in which the transverse horizontal\nvariable plays the role of time, a careful study of the purely imaginary\nspectrum of the operator obtained by linearising the evolutionary system at a\nline solitary wave, and an application of an infinite-dimensional version of\nthe classical Lyapunov centre theorem.\n", "  On a Lorentzian manifold the existence of a parallel null vector field\nimplies certain constraint conditions on the induced Riemannian geometry of a\nspace-like hypersurface. We will derive these constraint conditions and,\nconversely, show that every real analytic Riemannian manifold satisfying the\nconstraint conditions can be extended to a Lorentzian manifold with a parallel\nnull vector field. Similarly, every parallel null spinor on a Lorentzian\nmanifold induces an imaginary generalised Killing spinor on a space-like\nhypersurface. Then, based on the fact that a parallel spinor field induces a\nparallel vector field, we can apply the first result to prove: every real\nanalytic Riemannian manifold carrying a real analytic, imaginary generalised\nKilling spinor can be extended to a Lorentzian manifold with a parallel null\nspinor. Finally, we give examples of geodesically complete Riemannian manifolds\nsatisfying the constraint conditions.\n", "  We consider the elliptic-elliptic, focussing Davey-Stewartson equations,\nwhich have an explicit bright line soliton solution. The existence of a family\nof periodic solitons, which have the profile of the line soliton in the\nlongitudinal spatial direction and are periodic in the transverse spatial\ndirection, is established using dynamical systems arguments. We also show that\nthe line soliton is linearly unstable with respect to perturbations in the\ntransverse direction.\n", "  We present the TRIQS library, a Toolbox for Research on Interacting Quantum\nSystems. It is an open-source, computational physics library providing a\nframework for the quick development of applications in the field of many-body\nquantum physics, and in particular, strongly-correlated electronic systems. It\nsupplies components to develop codes in a modern, concise and efficient way:\ne.g. Green's function containers, a generic Monte Carlo class, and simple\ninterfaces to HDF5. TRIQS is a C++/Python library that can be used from either\nlanguage. It is distributed under the GNU General Public License (GPLv3).\nState-of-the-art applications based on the library, such as modern quantum\nmany-body solvers and interfaces between density-functional-theory codes and\ndynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) codes are distributed along with it.\n", "  We study the collapse of two-dimensional polymers, via an O($n$) model on the\nsquare lattice that allows for dilution, bending rigidity and short-range\nmonomer attractions. This model contains two candidates for the theta point,\n$\\Theta_{\\rm BN}$ and $\\Theta_{\\rm DS}$, both exactly solvable. The relative\nstability of these points, and the question of which one describes the\n`generic' theta point, have been the source of a long-standing debate.\nMoreover, the analytically predicted exponents of $\\Theta_{\\rm BN}$ have never\nbeen convincingly observed in numerical simulations.\n  In the present paper, we shed a new light on this confusing situation. We\nshow in particular that the continuum limit of $\\Theta_{\\rm BN}$ is an unusual\nconformal field theory, made in fact of a simple dense polymer decorated with\n{\\sl non-compact degrees of freedom}. This implies in particular that the\ncritical exponents take continuous rather than discrete values, and that\ncorrections to scaling lead to an unusual integral form. Furthermore, discrete\nstates may emerge from the continuum, but the latter are only\nnormalizable---and hence observable---for appropriate values of the model's\nparameters. We check these findings numerically. We also probe the non-compact\ndegrees of freedom in various ways, and establish that they are related to\nfluctuations of the density of monomers. Finally, we construct a field\ntheoretic model of the vicinity of $\\Theta_{\\rm BN}$ and examine the flow along\nthe multicritical line between $\\Theta_{\\rm BN}$ and $\\Theta_{\\rm DS}$.\n", "  In this paper we develop a new Peridynamic approach that naturally includes\nvarying horizon sizes and completely solves the \"ghost force\" issue. Therefore,\nthe concept of dual-horizon is introduced to consider the unbalanced\ninteractions between the particles with different horizon sizes. The present\nformulation is proved to fulfill both the balances of linear momentum and\nangular momentum. Neither the \"partial stress tensor\" nor the \"`slice\"\ntechnique are needed to ameliorate the ghost force issue in \\cite{Silling2014}.\nThe consistency of reaction forces is naturally fulfilled by a unified simple\nformulation. The method can be easily implemented to any existing peridynamics\ncode with minimal changes. A simple adaptive refinement procedure is proposed\nminimizing the computational cost. The method is applied here to the three\nPeridynamic formulations, namely bond based, ordinary state based and\nnon-ordinary state based Peridynamics. Both two- and three- dimensional\nexamples including the Kalthof-Winkler experiment and plate with branching\ncracks are tested to demonstrate the capability of the method in solving wave\npropagation, fracture and adaptive analysis .\n", "  We show that it is possible to model two-body resonant interactions at low\nenergy with a class of finite-range potentials based on the methods of Jost and\nKohn. These potentials are expressed in terms of the effective range $r_0$ and\nthe $s$-wave scattering length $a_s$. We derive continuum solutions of these\npotentials. By writing $V_{\\pm}(r) = V_{0}(r) + V_{\\pm}^{\\epsilon}(r)$, where\nthe sign +(-) refers to positive(negative) scattering length, $ V_{0}(r)$ is of\nthe form of P\\\"{o}schl-Teller potential and $V_{\\pm}^{\\epsilon}$ is expressed\nas a power series of the small parameter $\\epsilon = (\\sqrt{1 - 2\nr_0/a_s})^{-1} - 1 $ when $a_s$ is large, we derive Green function of\n$V_{0}(r)$. Using the Green function, solutions of $V_{\\pm}(r)$ for $|a_s| >\\!>\nr_0$ can be obtained numerically by treating $V_{\\pm}^{\\epsilon}(r)$as a\nperturbation. We describe the threshold behavior of scattering phase shift for\n$V_{0}(r)$. This study may be important for developing a better understanding\nof physics of strongly interacting ultracold atomic gases with tunable\ninteractions.\n", "  We present a brief review of the teleparallel equivalent of general\nrelativity and analyse the expression for the centre of mass density of the\ngravitational field. This expression has not been sufficiently discussed in the\nliterature. One motivation for the present analysis is the investigation of the\nlocalization of dark energy in the three-dimensional space, induced by a\ncosmological constant in a simple Schwarzschild-de Sitter space-time. We also\ninvestigate the gravitational centre of mass density in a particular model of\ndark matter, in the space-time of a point massive particle and in an arbitrary\nspace-time with axial symmetry. The results are plausible, and lead to the\nnotion of gravitational centre of mass (COM) distribution function.\n", "  In this proceedings, I will consider quantum aspects of a non-local,\ninfinite-derivative scalar field theory - a ${\\it toy \\, model}$ depiction of a\ncovariant infinite-derivative, non-local extension of Einstein's general\nrelativity which has previously been shown to be free from ghosts around the\nMinkowski background. The graviton propagator in this theory gets an\nexponential suppression making it ${\\it asymptotically \\, free}$, thus\nproviding strong prospects of resolving various classical and quantum\ndivergences. In particular, I will find that at $1$-loop, the $2$-point\nfunction is still divergent, but once this amplitude is renormalized by adding\nappropriate counter terms, the ultraviolet (UV) behavior of all other $1$-loop\ndiagrams as well as the $2$-loop, $2$-point function remains well under\ncontrol. I will go on to discuss how one may be able to generalize our\ncomputations and arguments to arbitrary loops.\n", "  We demonstrate that not all generalized Bogoliubov transformations lead to\n$\\cal D$-pseudo-bosons and prove that a correspondence between the two can only\nbe achieved with the imposition of specific constraints on the parameters\ndefining the transformation. For certain values of the parameters we find that\nthe norms of the vectors in sets of eigenvectors of two related apparently non\nself-adjoint number-like operators possess different types of asymptotic\nbehavior. We use this result to deduce further that they constitute bases for a\nHilbert space, albeit neither of them can form a Riesz base. When the\nconstraints are relaxed they cease to be Hilbert space bases, but remain $\\cal\nD$-quasi bases.\n", "  Nucleosynthesis of heavy elements requires the use of different experimental\nand theoretical methods to determine astrophysical reaction rates than light\nelement nucleosynthesis. Additionally, there are also larger uncertainties\ninvolved in the astrophysical models, both because the sites are not well known\nand because of differing numerical treatments in different models. As an\nexample for the latter, the production of p-nuclei is compared in two different\nstellar models, demonstrating that a model widely used for postproduction\ncalculations may have a zone grid too coarse to follow the synthesis of\np-nuclei in detail.\n", "  We predict a fast relaxation of photo-excited carriers in monolayer\ntransition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), which is mediated by the emission of\nlongitudinal optical (LO) phonons. By evaluating Born effective charges for\n${\\rm MoS_2, MoSe_2,WS_2}$, and ${\\rm WSe_2}$, we find that, due to the polar\ncoupling of electrons with LO phonons, the relaxation times for hot electrons\nand holes are of the order of a few ps.\n", "  We show that it is possible to cool interacting pairs of atoms by a lin\n$\\perp$ lin Sisyphus-like laser cooling scheme using counter-propagating\nphotoassociation (PA) lasers. It is shown that the center-of-mass motion (c.m.)\nof atom pairs can be trapped in molecular spin-dependent periodic potentials\ngenerated by the lasers. The proposed scheme is most effective for narrow-line\nPA transitions. We illustrate this with numerical calculations using fermionic\n$^{171}$Yb atoms as an example.\n", "  With a novel 3D discrete-element method specially developed with adhesive\ncontact mechanics, random loose packings of uniform spherical micron-sized\nparticles are fully investigated. The results show that large velocity, large\nsize or weak adhesion can produce a relatively dense packing when other\nparameters are fixed, and these combined effects can be characterized by a\ndimensionless adhesion parameter ( $Ad=\\omega/2\\rho_pU^2_0R$). Four regimes are\nidentified based on the value of $Ad$: RCP regime with $Ad<\\sim 0.01$; RLP\nregime with $\\sim 0.01<Ad<1$; adhesion regime with $1<Ad<20$ and an asymptotic\nregime with $Ad>20$. Force distribution of these adhesive loose packings\nfollows $P(f)\\sim f^\\theta$ for small forces and $P(f)\\sim \\exp^{-\\beta f}$ for\nbig forces, respectively, which shares a similar form with that in packings\nwithout adhesion but results in distinct exponents of $\\theta=0.879$,\n$\\beta=0.839$. A local mechanical equilibrium analysis shows that adhesion\nenhances both sliding and rolling resistance so that fewer neighbours are\nneeded to satisfy the force and torque balance.\n", "  We construct a topological sigma model and a current algebra based on a\nCourant algebroid structure on a Poisson manifold. In order to construct\nmodels, we reformulate the Poisson Courant algebroid by supergeometric\nconstruction on a QP-manifold. A new duality of Courant algebroids which\ntransforms H-flux and R-flux is proposed, where the transformation is\ninterpreted as a canonical transformation of a graded symplectic manifold.\n", "  A bilayer system comprising a Kondo insulator coupled to a simple metal\n(KI-M) is considered. Employing the framework of dynamical mean field theory,\nthe model system is shown to exhibit a surface of quantum critical points\n(QCPs), that separates a Kondo screened, Fermi liquid phase from a local\nmoment, Mott insulating phase. The quantum critical nature of these Mott\ntransitions is characterized by the vanishing of (a) the coherence scale on the\nFermi liquid side, and (b) the Mott gap on the MI side. In contrast to the\nusual `large to small' Fermi surface (FS) QCPs in heavy fermion systems, the\nbilayer KI-M system exhibits a complete FS destruction.\n", "  Building on our previous work for $a_2^{(2)}$ and $a_3^{(2)}$ we explore\nsystematically the continuum limit of gapless $a_{N-1}^{(2)}$ vertex models and\nspin chains. We find the existence of three possible regimes. Regimes I and II\nfor $a_{2n-1}^{(2)}$ are related with $a_{2n-1}^{(2)}$ Toda, and described by\n$n$ compact bosons. Regime I for $a_{2n}^{(2)}$ is related with $a_{2n}^{(2)}$\nToda and involves $n$ compact bosons, while regime II is related instead with\n$B^{(1)}(0,n)$ super Toda, and involves in addition a single Majorana fermion.\nThe most interesting is regime III, where {\\sl non-compact} degrees of freedom\nappear, generalising the emergence of the Euclidean black hole CFT in the\n$a_{2}^{(2)}$ case. For $a_{2n}^{(2)}$ we find a continuum limit made of $n$\ncompact and $n$ non-compact bosons, while for $a_{2n-1}^{(2)}$ we find $n$\ncompact and $n-1$ non-compact bosons. We also find deep relations between\n$a_{N-1}^{(2)}$ in regime III and the gauged WZW models $SO(N)/SO(N-1)$.\n", "  We investigate the efficiency of Quantum Adiabatic Optimization when\novercoming potential barriers to get from a local to a global minimum.\nSpecifically we look at n qubit systems with symmetric cost functions f:{0,\n1}^n->R where the ground state must tunnel through a potential barrier of width\nn^a and height n^b. By the quantum adiabatic theorem the time delay sufficient\nto ensure tunneling grows quadratically with the inverse spectral gap during\nthis tunneling process. We analyze barrier sizes with 1/2 < a + b and a < 1/2\nand show that the minimum gap scales polynomially as n^{1/2-a-b} when 2a+b < 1\nand exponentially as n^{-b/2} exp(-C n^{(2a+b-1)/2} ) when 1 < 2a+b. Our proof\nuses elementary techniques and confirms and extends an unpublished folklore\nresult by Goldstone, which used large spin and instanton methods. Parts of our\nresult also refine recent results by Kong and Crosson and Jiang et al. about\nthe exponential gap scaling.\n", "  We derive the general counting rules for a quantum effective field theory\n(EFT) in $\\mathsf{d}$ dimensions. The rules are valid for strongly and weakly\ncoupled theories, and predict that all kinetic energy terms are canonically\nnormalized. They determine the energy dependence of scattering cross sections\nin the range of validity of the EFT expansion. We show that the size of cross\nsections is controlled by the $\\Lambda$ power counting of EFT, not by chiral\ncounting, even for chiral perturbation theory ($\\chi$PT). The relation between\n$\\Lambda$ and $f$ is generalized to $\\mathsf{d}$ dimensions. We show that the\nnaive dimensional analysis $4\\pi$ counting is related to $\\hbar$ counting. The\nEFT counting rules are applied to $\\chi$PT, low-energy weak interactions,\nStandard Model EFT and the non-trivial case of Higgs EFT.\n", "  Starting from the general effective hamiltonian relevant to the $b\\to s$\ntransitions, we derive the expressions for the full angular distributions of\nthe $B \\to K^{(\\ast )} \\ell_1 \\ell_2$ decay modes, as well as for ${\\cal B}(B_s\n\\to \\ell_1\\ell_2 )$ ($\\ell_1\\neq \\ell_2$). We point out the differences in the\ntreatment of the lepton flavor violating modes with respect to the lepton\nflavor conserving ones. Concerning the relevant Wilson coefficients we evaluate\nthem in two different scenarios: (i) The (pseudo-)scalar coefficients are\nobtained using the (pseudo-)scalar coupling extracted from the experimental\nnon-zero value of ${\\cal B}(h\\to \\mu\\tau)$, (ii) Revisiting a $Z^\\prime$-model\nin which the flavor changing neutral couplings are allowed. We provide the\nnumerical estimates of the branching fractions of the above-mentioned modes in\nboth scenarios.\n", "  The beam energy dependence of correlation lengths (the Hanbury-Brown-Twiss\nradii) is calculated by using a blast-wave model and the results are comparable\nwith those from RHIC-STAR beam energy scan data as well as the LHC-ALICE\nmeasurements. A set of parameter for the blast-wave model as a function of beam\nenergy under study are obtained by fit to the HBT radii at each energy point.\nThe transverse momentum dependence of HBT radii is presented with the extracted\nparameters for Au + Au collision at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} = $ 200 GeV and for Pb+Pb\ncollisions at 2.76 TeV. From our study one can learn that particle emission\nduration can not be ignored while calculating the HBT radii with the same\nparameters. And tuning kinetic freeze-out temperature in a range will result in\nsystem lifetime changing in the reverse direction as it is found in RHIC-STAR\nexperiment measurements.\n", "  The fundamental singularity theorem of FLRW cosmologies assumes that the\nmatter content in the cosmological model obeys the strong energy condition\nalong with a nonpositive cosmological constant which gives rise to an\nirrotational geodesic singularity. In this paper, we show that the important\ncase of a spatially flat Friedmann-Lema\\^{i}tre-Robertson-Walker universe with\nbarotropic matter obeying only the \\emph{weak} energy condition with a\nnonnegative cosmological constant also contains a past singularity. We\naccomplish this using topological methods from dynamical systems theory. The\nmethods employed in this paper are sufficiently general that they could be\nextended to other models to study the existence of past singularities.\n", "  Network ecology is a rising field of quantitative biology representing\necosystems as complex networks. A suitable example is parasite spreading:\nseveral parasites may be transmitted among their hosts through different\nmechanisms, each one giving rise to a network of interactions. Modelling these\nnetworked, ecological interactions at the same time is still an open challenge.\nWe present a novel spatially-embedded multiplex network framework for modelling\nmulti-host infection spreading through multiple routes of transmission. Our\nmodel is inspired by T. cruzi, a parasite transmitted by trophic and vectorial\nmechanisms. Our ecological network model is represented by a multiplex in which\nnodes represent species populations interacting through a food web and a\nparasite contaminative layer at the same time. We modelled an SI dynamics in\ntwo different scenarios: a simple theoretical food web and an empirical one.\nOur simulations in both scenarios show that the infection is more widespread\nwhen both the trophic and the contaminative interactions are considered with\nequal rates. This indicates that trophic and contaminative transmission may\nhave additive effects in real ecosystems. We also find that the ratio of\nvectors-to-host in the community (i) crucially influences the infection spread,\n(ii) regulates a percolating phase transition in the rate of parasite\ntransmission and (iii) increases the infection rate in hosts. By immunising the\nsame fractions of predator and prey populations, we show that the multiplex\ntopology is fundamental in outlining the role that each host species plays in\nparasite transmission in a given ecosystem. We also show that the multiplex\nmodels provide a richer phenomenology in terms of parasite spreading dynamics\ncompared to mono-layer models. Our work opens new challenges and provides new\nquantitative tools for modelling multi-channel spreading in networked systems.\n", "  This paper summarizes a new proposal to define rigorously a sector of loop\nquantum gravity at the diffeomorphism invariant level corresponding to\nhomogeneous and isotropic cosmologies, thereby enabling a detailed comparison\nof results in loop quantum gravity and loop quantum cosmology. The key\ntechnical steps we have completed are (a) to formulate conditions for\nhomogeneity and isotropy in a diffeomorphism covariant way on the classical\nphase space of general relativity, and (b) to translate these conditions\nconsistently using well-understood techniques to loop quantum gravity. Some\nadditional steps, such as constructing a specific embedding of the Hilbert\nspace of loop quantum cosmology into a space of (distributional) states in the\nfull theory, remain incomplete. However, we also describe, as a proof of\nconcept, a complete analysis of an analogous embedding of homogeneous and\nisotropic loop quantum cosmology into the quantum Bianchi I model of Ashtekar\nand Wilson-Ewing. Details will appear in a pair of forthcoming papers.\n", "  The origin of the observed large scale magnetic fields in the Universe is a\nmystery. The seed of these magnetic fields has been attributed to physical\nprocess in the early universe. In this work we provide a mechanism for the\ngeneration of a primordial magnetic field in the early universe via the Weibel\ninstability in the quark gluon plasma. The Weibel instability occurs in the\nplasma if there is an anisotropy in the particle distribution function of the\nparticles. In early universe, the velocity anisotropy required for Weibel\ninstability to operate is generated in the quark gluon plasma by the collapse\nof closed $Z(3)$ domain walls that arise in the deconfined phase of the QCD\n(above $T\\sim 200$ MeV). Such large domains can arise in the context of certain\nlow energy scale inflationary models. The closed domains undergo supersonic\ncollapse and the velocity anisotropy is generated in the shocks produced in the\nwake of the collapsing domain walls. This results in a two stream Weibel\ninstability in the ultra-relativistic quark gluon plasma. The instability in\nturn generates strong magnetic fields in the plasma. We find that the field\nstrengths generated can be comparable to the equipartition energy density at\nthe QCD scale which is of the order of $10^{18}$ G.\n", "  Magnetization of soft-ferromagnetic nano- and microtubes of nanometer-thin\nwalls (a single-widening rolled-up nanomembranes) is theoretically studied\nusing analytical and numerical approaches including different stress-induced\nanisotropies. Within the analytical study, we consider magnetostatic effects\nqualitatively, with an effective anisotropy, while they are fully treated in\nthe micromagnetic simulations (limited to the tubes of submicrometer diameters\nhowever). Basic types of the periodic ordering have been established and their\npresence in nanotubes of polycrystalline Permalloy and cobalt has been verified\nwithin the simulations. The domain structure is basically determined by a\nmaterial-deposition-induced helical stress or a cooling-induced axial stress\nvia the volume magnetostriction while it is influenced by the distribution of\nmagnetic charges as well. Also, it is dependent on the initial state of the\nmagnetization process.\n", "  We consider a general model of the sensorimotor loop of an agent interacting\nwith the world. This formalises Uexk\\\"ull's notion of a \\emph{function-circle}.\nHere, we assume a particular causal structure, mechanistically described in\nterms of Markov kernels. In this generality, we define two $\\sigma$-algebras of\nevents in the world that describe two respective perspectives: (1) the\nperspective of an external observer, (2) the intrinsic perspective of the\nagent. Not all aspects of the world, seen from the external perspective, are\naccessible to the agent. This is expressed by the fact that the second\n$\\sigma$-algebra is a subalgebra of the first one. We propose the smaller one\nas formalisation of Uexk\\\"ull's \\emph{Umwelt} concept. We show that, under\ncontinuity and compactness assumptions, the global dynamics of the world can be\nsimplified without changing the internal process. This simplification can serve\nas a minimal world model that the system must have in order to be consistent\nwith the internal process.\n", "  We present a versatile mid-infrared frequency comb spectroscopy system based\non a doubly resonant optical parametric oscillator tunable in the 3-5.4 {\\mu}m\nrange and two detection methods, a Fourier transform spectrometer (FTS) and a\nVernier spectrometer. Using the FTS with a multipass cell we measure\nhigh-precision broadband absorption spectra of CH$_4$ and NO at ~3.3 {\\mu}m and\n~5.2 {\\mu}m, respectively, and of atmospheric species (CH$_4$, CO, CO$_2$ and\nH$_2$O) in air in the signal and idler wavelength range. The figure of merit of\nthe system is on the order of 10$^{-8}$ cm$^{-1}$ Hz$^{-1/2}$ per spectral\nelement, and multiline fitting yields minimum detectable concentrations of\n10-20 ppb Hz$^{-1/2}$ for CH$_4$, NO and CO. For the first time in the\nmid-infrared, we perform continuous-filtering Vernier spectroscopy using a low\nfinesse enhancement cavity, a grating and a single detector, and measure the\nabsorption spectrum of CH$_4$ and H$_2$O in ambient air at ~3.3 {\\mu}m.\n", "  This paper describes a measurement of fiducial and differential cross\nsections of gluon-fusion Higgs boson production in the\n$H{\\rightarrow\\,}WW^{\\ast}{\\rightarrow\\,}e\\nu\\mu\\nu$ channel, using 20.3\nfb$^{-1}$ of proton-proton collision data. The data were produced at a\ncentre-of-mass energy of $\\sqrt{s} = 8$ TeV at the CERN Large Hadron Collider\nand recorded by the ATLAS detector in 2012. Cross sections are measured from\nthe observed $H{\\rightarrow\\,}WW^{\\ast}{\\rightarrow\\,}e\\nu\\mu\\nu$ signal yield\nin categories distinguished by the number of associated jets. The total cross\nsection is measured in a fiducial region defined by the kinematic properties of\nthe charged leptons and neutrinos. Differential cross sections are reported as\na function of the number of jets, the Higgs boson transverse momentum, the\ndilepton rapidity, and the transverse momentum of the leading jet. The jet-veto\nefficiency, or fraction of events with no jets above a given transverse\nmomentum threshold, is also reported. All measurements are compared to QCD\npredictions from Monte Carlo generators and fixed-order calculations, and are\nin agreement with the Standard Model predictions.\n", "  We theoretically consider superconducting proximity effect, using the\nBogoliubov-de Gennes theory, in heterostructure sandwich-type geometries\ninvolving a normal s-wave superconductor and a non-superconducting material\nwith the proximity effect being driven by Cooper pairs tunneling from the\nsuperconducting slab to the non-superconducting slab. Applications of the\nsuperconducting proximity effect may rely on an induced spectral gap or induced\npairing correlations without any spectral gap. We clarify that in a\nnon-superconducting material the induced spectral gap and pairing correlations\nare independent physical quantities arising from the proximity effect. This is\na crucial issue in proposals to create topological superconductivity through\nthe proximity effect. Heterostructures of 3D topological insulator (TI) slabs\non conventional s-wave superconductor (SC) substrates provide a platform, with\nproximity-induced topological superconductivity expected to be observed on the\n\"naked\" top surface of a thin TI slab. We theoretically study the induced\nsuperconducting gap on this naked surface. In addition, we compare against the\ninduced spectral gap in heterostructures of SC with a normal metal or a\nsemiconductor with strong spin orbit coupling and a Zeeman splitting potential\n(another platform for topological superconductivity). We find that for any\nmodel for the non-SC metal (including metallic TI) the induced spectral gap on\nthe naked surface decays as $L^{-3}$ as the thickness ($L$) of the non-SC slab\nis increased in contrast to the slower $1/L$ decay of the pairing correlations.\nOur distinction between proximity-induced spectral gap (with its faster spatial\ndecay) and pairing correlation (with its slower spatial decay) has important\nimplications for the currently active search for topological superconductivity\nand Majorana fermions in various superconducting heterostructures.\n", "  We present a new algorithm to construct a purely four dimensional\nrepresentation of higher-order perturbative corrections to physical\ncross-sections at next-to-leading order (NLO). The algorithm is based on the\nloop-tree duality (LTD), and it is implemented by introducing a suitable\nmapping between the external and loop momenta of the virtual scattering\namplitudes, and the external momenta of the real emission corrections. In this\nway, the sum over degenerate infrared states is performed at integrand level\nand the cancellation of infrared divergences occurs locally without introducing\nsubtraction counter-terms to deal with soft and final-state collinear\nsingularities. The dual representation of ultraviolet counter-terms is also\ndiscussed in detail, in particular for self-energy contributions. The method is\nfirst illustrated with the scalar three-point function, before proceeding with\nthe calculation of the physical cross-section for $\\gamma^* \\to q \\bar{q}(g)$,\nand its generalisation to multi-leg processes. The extension to\nnext-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) is briefly commented.\n", "  Electronic nematicity plays important role in iron-based superconductors.\nThese materials have layered structure and theoretical description of their\nmagnetic and nematic transitions has been well established in two-dimensional\napproximation, i.e., when the layers can be treated independently. However, the\ninteraction between iron layers mediated by electron tunneling may cause\nnon-trivial three-dimensional behavior. Starting from the simplest model for\norbital nematic in a single layer, we investigate the influence of interlayer\ntunneling on bulk nematic order and possible preemptive state where this order\nis only formed near the surface.\n  We found that the interlayer tunneling suppresses the bulk nematicity which\nmakes favorable formation of a surface nematic above the bulk transition\ntemperature. The purely electronic tunneling Hamiltonian, however, favors\nalternating from layer-to-layer nematic order parameter in the bulk. The\nuniform bulk state typically observed experimentally may be stabilized by the\ncoupling with the elastic lattice deformation. Depending on strength of this\ncoupling, we found three regimes: (i) surface nematic and alternating bulk\norder, (ii) surface nematic and uniform bulk order, and (iii) uniform bulk\norder without the intermediate surface phase. The intermediate surface-nematic\nstate may resolve the current controversy about the existence of the weak\n\"meta-nematic transition\" in the compound BaFe$_2$As$_{2-x}$P$_{x}$.\n", "  The Nekrasov-Shatashvili limit of the refined topological string on toric\nCalabi-Yau manifolds and the resulting quantum geometry is studied from a\nnon-perturbative perspective. The quantum differential and thus the quantum\nperiods exhibit Stokes phenomena over the combined string coupling and\nquantized Kaehler moduli space. We outline that the underlying formalism of\nexact quantization is generally applicable to points in moduli space featuring\nmassless hypermultiplets, leading to non-perturbative band splitting. Our prime\nexample is local P1xP1 near a conifold point in moduli space. In particular, we\nwill present numerical evidence that in a Stokes chamber of interest the string\nbased quantum geometry reproduces the non-perturbative corrections for the\nNekrasov-Shatashvili limit of 4d supersymmetric SU(2) gauge theory at strong\ncoupling found in the previous part of this series. A preliminary discussion of\nlocal P2 near the conifold point in moduli space is also provided.\n", "  We investigate Landau gauge $SU(3)$ Yang-Mills theory in a systematic vertex\nexpansion scheme for the effective action with the functional renormalisation\ngroup. Particular focus is put on the dynamical creation of the gluon mass gap\nat non-perturbative momenta and the consistent treatment of quadratic\ndivergences. The non-perturbative ghost and transverse gluon propagators as\nwell as the momentum-dependent ghost-gluon, three-gluon and four-gluon vertices\nare calculated self-consistently with the classical action as only input. The\napparent convergence of the expansion scheme is discussed and within the\nerrors, our numerical results are in quantitative agreement with available\nlattice results.\n", "  In this paper, we study phase diagrams of dipolar hard-core boson gases on\nthe honeycomb lattice. The system is described by the Haldane-Bose-Hubbard\nmodel with complex hopping amplitudes and the nearest neighbor repulsion. By\nusing the slave-particle representation of the hard-core bosons and also the\npath-integral quantum Monte-Carlo simulations, we investigate the system and to\nshow that the systems have a rich phase diagram. There are Mott, superfluid,\nchiral superfluid, and sublattice chiral superfluid phases as well as the\ndensity-wave phase. We also found that there exists a coexisting phase of\nsuperfluid and chiral superfluid. Critical behaviors of the phase transitions\nare also clarified.\n", "  We theoretically study high-order harmonic generation (HHG) from solid-phase\nsystems in spatially inhomogeneous strong laser fields originated by resonant\nplasmons within a metallic nanostructure. The intensity of the second plateau\nin HHG may be enhanced by two-three orders and be comparable with the intensity\nof the first plateau. This is due to bigger transition probabilities to higher\nconduction bands. It provides us a practical way to increase the yields of HHG\nwith laser intensity below the damage threshold. It presents a promising way to\ntriple the range of HHG spectra in experimental measurements. It also allows to\ngenerate intense isolated attosecond pulse from solids driven by few-cycle\nlaser fields.\n", "  We study the pairing symmetry of a doped Kane-Mele model on a honeycomb\nlattice with on-site Coulomb interaction. The pairing instability of Cooper\npair is calculated based on the linearized Eliashberg equation within the\nrandom phase approximation (RPA). When the magnitude of the spin-orbit coupling\nis weak, even-frequency spin-singlet even-parity (ESE) pairing is dominant. On\nthe other hand, with the increase of the spin-orbit coupling, we show that the\neven-frequency spin-triplet odd-parity (ETO) f-wave pairing exceeds ESE one.\nETO f-wave pairing is supported by the longitudinal spin fluctuation. Since the\ntransverse spin fluctuation is strongly suppressed by spin-orbit coupling, ETO\nf-wave pairing becomes dominant for large magnitude of spin-orbit coupling.\n", "  We report the formation of a binary crystal of hard polyhedra due solely to\nentropic forces. Although the alternating arrangement of octahedra and\ntetrahedra is a known space-tessellation, it had not previously been observed\nin self-assembly simulations. Both known one-component phases - the dodecagonal\nquasicrystal of tetrahedra and the densest-packing of octahedra in the\nMinkowski lattice - are found to coexist with the binary phase. No additional\ncrystalline phases were observed.\n", "  In communication complexity, a number of distant parties have the task of\ncalculating a distributed function of their inputs, while minimizing the amount\nof communication between them. It is known that with quantum resources, such as\nentanglement and quantum channels, one can obtain significant reductions in the\ncommunication complexity of some tasks. In this work, we study the role of the\nquantum superposition of the direction of communication as a resource for\ncommunication complexity. We present a tripartite communication task for which\nsuch a superposition allows for an exponential saving in communication,\ncompared to one-way quantum (or classical) communication; the advantage also\nholds when we allow for protocols with bounded error probability.\n", "  Hyperbolic Meta-Materials~(HMMs) are anisotropic materials with permittivity\ntensor that has both positive and negative eigenvalues. Here we report that by\nusing a type II HMM as cladding material, a waveguide which only supports\nhigher order modes can be achieved, while the lower order modes become leaky\nand are absorbed in the HMM cladding. This counter intuitive property can lead\nto novel application in optical communication and photonic integrated circuit.\nThe loss in our HMM-Insulator-HMM~(HIH) waveguide is smaller than that of\nsimilar guided mode in a Metal-Insulator-Metal~(MIM) waveguide.\n", "  Several Fe chalcogenide superconductors without hole pockets at the Fermi\nlevel display high temperature superconductivity, in apparent contradiction to\nnaive spin fluctuation pairing arguments. Recently, scanning tunneling\nmicroscopy measurements have measured the influence of impurities on some of\nthese materials, and claimed that non-magnetic impurities do not create in-gap\nstates, leading to the conclusion that the gap must be $s_{++}$, i.e.\nconventional $s$ wave with no gap sign change. Here we critique this argument,\nand give various ways sign-changing gaps can be consistent with the absence of\nsuch bound states. In particular, we calculate the bound states for an $s_\\pm$\nsystem with a hole pocket below the Fermi level, and show that the nonmagnetic\nimpurity bound state energy generically tracks the gap edge $E_{min}$ in the\nsystem, thereby rendering it unobservable. A failure to observe a bound state\nin the case of a nonmagnetic impurity can therefore not be used as an argument\nto exclude sign-changing pairing states.\n", "  An expression is derived for angle-resolved photocurrent from a semi-infinite\ncorrelated system. Within the sudden approximation, the photocurrent is\nproportional to the spectral function of a one-particle two-time retarded\nGreen's function $\\mathcal{G}$ of an operator that creates an electron in a\nspecial quantum state $\\chi$ localized at the surface. For a system described\nby a many-body single-band model we present an analytical expression that\nrelates the Green's function $\\mathcal{G}$ with the Green's function of an\ninfinite crystal $G_{b,\\mathbf{k}}(\\omega)$ in Wannier representation. The role\nof final states and of the crystal surface is analysed for a model Green's\nfunction of the infinite crystal with a three-peak spectral function typical of\na Mott-Hubbard metal. The momentum dependence of both the quasiparticle pole\nposition and the spectral weight of the incoherent band manifest themselves in\nthe shape of the photocurrent energy distribution curve.\n", "  We show that, regardless of the dimension of the Hilbert space, there exists\nno set of rays revealing state-independent contextuality with less than 13\nrays. This implies that the set proposed by Yu and Oh in dimension three [Phys.\nRev. Lett. 108, 030402 (2012)] is actually the minimal set in quantum theory.\nThis contrasts with the case of Kochen-Specker sets, where the smallest set\noccurs in dimension four.\n", "  We investigate the switching field distribution and the resulting bit error\nrate of exchange coupled ferri-/ferromagnetic bilayer island arrays by\nmicromagnetic simulations. Using islands with varying microstructure and\nanisotropic properties, the intrinsic switching field distribution is computed.\nThe dipolar contribution to the switching field distribution is obtained\nseparately by using a model of a triangular patterned island array resembling\n$1.4\\,\\mathrm{Tb/in}^2$ bit patterned media. Both contributions are computed\nfor different thickness of the soft exchange coupled ferrimagnet and also for\nferromagnetic single phase FePt islands. A bit patterned media with a bilayer\nstructure of FeGd($5\\,\\mathrm{nm}$)/FePt($5\\,\\mathrm{nm}$) shows a bit error\nrate of $10^{-4}$ with a write field of $1.16\\,\\mathrm{T}$.\n", "  Phase competition and excitations in the one-dimensional neutral-ionic\ntransition systems are theoretically studied comprehensively. From the\nsemiclassical treatment of the bosonized Hamiltonian, we examine the\ncompetition among the neutral (N), ferroelectric-ionic (I$_\\mathrm{ferro}$) and\nparaelectric-ionic (I$_\\mathrm{para}$) states. The phase transitions between\nthem can become first-order when the fluctuation-induced higher-order\ncommensurability potential is considered. In particular, the description of the\nfirst-order phase boundary between N and I$_\\mathrm{ferro}$ enables us to\nanalyze N-I$_\\mathrm{ferro}$ domain walls. Soliton excitations in the three\nphases are described explicitly and their formation energies are evaluated\nacross the phase boundaries. The characters of the soliton and domain-wall\nexcitations are classified in terms of the topological charge and spin. The\nrelevance to the experimental observations in the molecular neutral-ionic\ntransition systems is discussed. We ascribe the pressure-induced crossover in\ntetrathiafulvalene-$p$-chloranil (TTF-CA) at a high-temperature region to that\nfrom the N to the I$_\\mathrm{para}$ state, and discuss its consequence.\n", "  Forming a three dimensional view of the Universe is a long-standing goal of\nastronomical observations, and one that becomes increasingly difficult at high\nredshift. In this paper we discuss how tomography of the intergalactic medium\n(IGM) at $z\\simeq 2.5$ can be used to estimate the redshifts of massive\ngalaxies in a large volume of the Universe based on spectra of galaxies in\ntheir background. Our method is based on the fact that hierarchical structure\nformation leads to a strong dependence of the halo density on large-scale\nenvironment. A map of the latter can thus be used to refine our knowledge of\nthe redshifts of halos and the galaxies and AGN which they host. We show that\ntomographic maps of the IGM at a resolution of $2.5\\,h^{-1}$Mpc can determine\nthe redshifts of more than 90 per cent of massive galaxies with redshift\nuncertainty $\\Delta z/(1+z)=0.01$. Higher resolution maps allow such redshift\nestimation for lower mass galaxies and halos.\n", "  Due to the presence of strong static correlation effects and noncovalent\ninteractions, accurate prediction of the electronic and hydrogen storage\nproperties of Li-adsorbed acenes with n linearly fused benzene rings (n = 3 -\n8) has been very challenging for conventional electronic structure methods. To\nmeet the challenge, we study these properties using our recently developed\nthermally-assisted-occupation density functional theory (TAO-DFT) with\ndispersion corrections. In contrast to pure acenes, the binding energies of H2\nmolecules on Li-adsorbed acenes are in the ideal binding energy range (about 20\nto 40 kJ/mol per H2). Besides, the H2 gravimetric storage capacities of\nLi-adsorbed acenes are in the range of 9.9 to 10.7 wt%, satisfying the United\nStates Department of Energy (USDOE) ultimate target of 7.5 wt%. On the basis of\nour results, Li-adsorbed acenes can be high-capacity hydrogen storage materials\nfor reversible hydrogen uptake and release at ambient conditions.\n", "  We have investigated the crystal, electronic, and magnetic structure of Mn5O8\nby means of state of-the-art density functional theory calculations and neutron\npowder diffraction (NPD) measurements. This compound stabilizes in the\nmonoclinic structure with space group C2/m where the Mn ions are in the\ndistorted octahedral and trigonal prismatic coordination with oxygen atoms. The\ncalculated structural parameters based on total energy calculations are found\nto be in excellent agreement with low temperature NPD measurements when we\naccounted correct magnetic structure and Coulomb correlation effect into the\ncomputation. Bond strength analysis based on crystal orbital Hamiltonian\npopulation between constituents indicating strong anisotropy in the bonding\nbehavior which results in layered nature of its crystal structure. Using fully\nrelativistic generalized-gradient approximation with Hubbard U (GGA+U) we found\nthat the magnetic ordering in Mn5O8 is A-type antiferromagnetic and the\ndirection of easy axis is [1 0 0] in agreement with susceptibility and NPD\nmeasurements. However, the calculation without the inclusion of HubbardU leads\nto ferrimagnetic half metal as ground state contradictory to experimental\nfindings, indicating the presence of strong Coulomb correlation effect in this\nmaterial. The GGA calculations without Coulomb correction effect itself is\nsufficient to reproduce our experimentally observed magnetic moments in various\nMn sites.\n", "  Low-loss single-mode optical waveguide fabrication process in extra-white\nsoda-lime glass is demonstrated. Waveguiding structures are formed in bulk\nsubstrates employing femtosecond laser writing technology. The combination of a\nslit beam-shaping method and a multiscan fabrication process enables printing\nof waveguides with a well-defined symmetric cross-section profile. Fabricated\nwaveguides exhibit 0.86 dB/cm propagation loss for 800~nm wavelength. Bending\nloss in the waveguides are addressed experimentally and compared with a model\nfor radiation loss.\n", "  We investigate the non-equilibrium quantum dynamics of a canonical\nlight-matter system, namely the Dicke model, when the light-matter interaction\nis ramped up and down through a cycle across the quantum phase transition. Our\ncalculations reveal a rich set of dynamical behaviors determined by the cycle\ntimes, ranging from the slow, near adiabatic regime through to the fast, sudden\nquench regime. As the cycle time decreases, we uncover a crossover from an\noscillatory exchange of quantum information between light and matter that\napproaches a reversible adiabatic process, to a dispersive regime that\ngenerates large values of light-matter entanglement. The phenomena uncovered in\nthis work have implications in quantum control, quantum interferometry, as well\nas in quantum information theory.\n", "  We define and compute the dressed elliptic genus of N = 2 heterotic\ncompactifications with torsion that are principal two-torus bundles over a K3\nsurface. We consider the most general gauge bundle compatible with\nsupersymmetry, a stable holomorphic vector bundle over the base together with\nan Abelian bundle over the total space, generalizing the computation previously\ndone by the authors in the absence of the latter. Starting from a (0,2) gauged\nlinear sigma-model with torsion we use supersymmetric localization to obtain\nthe result. We provide also a mathematical definition of the dressed elliptic\ngenus as a modified Euler characteristic and prove that both expressions agree\nfor hypersurfaces in weighted projective spaces. Finally we show that it admits\na natural decomposition in terms of N = 4 superconformal characters, that may\nbe useful to investigate moonshine phenomena for this wide class of N = 2\nvacua, that includes K3*T2 compactifications as special cases.\n", "  We investigate two-dimensional liquid bridges trapped between pairs of\nidentical horizontal cylinders. The cylinders support forces due to surface\ntension and hydrostatic pressure which balance the weight of the liquid. The\nshape of the liquid bridge is determined by analytically solving the nonlinear\nLaplace-Young equation. Parameters that maximize the trapping capacity (defined\nas the cross-sectional area of the liquid bridge) are then determined. The\nresults show that these parameters can be approximated with simple\nrelationships when the radius of the cylinders is small compared to the\ncapillary length. For such small cylinders, liquid bridges with the largest\ncross sectional area occur when the centre-to-centre distance between the\ncylinders is approximately twice the capillary length. The maximum trapping\ncapacity for a pair of cylinders at a given separation is linearly related to\nthe separation when it is small compared to the capillary length. The meniscus\nslope angle of the largest liquid bridge produced in this regime is also a\nlinear function of the separation. We additionally derive approximate solutions\nfor the profile of a liquid bridge making use of the linearized Laplace-Young\nequation. These solutions analytically verify the above relationships obtained\nfor the maximization of the trapping capacity.\n", "  A remarkable feature of Schur functions -- the common eigenfunctions of\ncut-and-join operators from $W_\\infty$ -- is that they factorize at the\npeculiar two-parametric topological locus in the space of time-variables, what\nis known as the hook formula for quantum dimensions of representations of\n$U_q(SL_N)$ and plays a big role in various applications. This factorization\nsurvives at the level of Macdonald polynomials. We look for its further\ngeneralization to {\\it generalized} Macdonald polynomials (GMP), associated in\nthe same way with the toroidal Ding-Iohara-Miki algebras, which play the\ncentral role in modern studies in Seiberg-Witten-Nekrasov theory. In the\nsimplest case of the first-coproduct eigenfunctions, where GMP depend on just\ntwo sets of time-variables, we discover a weak factorization -- on a\ncodimension-one slice of the topological locus, what is already a very\nnon-trivial property, calling for proof and better understanding.\n", "  We propose a novel phonon assisted Auger process unique to the electronic\nband structure of monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), which\ndominates the radiative recombination of ground state excitons in Tungsten\nbased TMDCs. Using experimental and DFT computed values for the exciton\nenergies, spin-orbit splittings, optical matrix element, and the Auger matrix\nelements, we find that the Auger process begins to dominate at carrier\ndensities as low as $10^{9-10}~{\\rm cm^{-2}}$, thus providing a plausible\nexplanation for the low quantum efficiencies reported for these materials.\n", "  In this article, we try to test the influence of the modification of the\nscalar product, found in the problems of the energy-dependent potential, on the\nphysical properties of the harmonic oscillator in one dimension. For this, we\nat first discuss the effect of this change on the thermodynamic properties of\nthis oscillator, and then on the parameter of Fisher, well known in the field\nof quantum information. For the second problem, we are an obligation to\nredefine this parameter. Finally, the uncertainly relation of Cramer-Rao is\nwell recovered in our problem in question.\n", "  Measurements of the beta decay rates of nuclei have revealed annual\nperiodicities with approximately the same relative amplitude even though the\nhalf-lives range over nine orders of magnitude. Here we show that this can be\nexplained if the emitted neutrinos behave as if they propagate in a medium with\na refractive index which varies as the Earth orbits the sun. This refractive\nindex may be due to fundamental Lorentz non-invariance (LNI), or apparent LNI\narising from interactions with solar or relic neutrinos, or dark matter.\nAdditionally, this medium could have consequences for experiments attempting to\nmeasure the neutrino mass.\n", "  A search is conducted for both resonant and non-resonant high-mass new\nphenomena in dielectron and dimuon final states. The search uses 3.2 fb$^{-1}$\nof proton-proton collision data, collected at $\\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV by the ATLAS\nexperiment at the LHC in 2015. The dilepton invariant mass is used as the\ndiscriminating variable. No significant deviation from the Standard Model\nprediction is observed; therefore limits are set on the signal model parameters\nof interest at 95% credibility level. Upper limits are set on the cross-section\ntimes branching ratio for resonances decaying to dileptons, and the limits are\nconverted into lower limits on the resonance mass, ranging between 2.74 TeV and\n3.36 TeV, depending on the model. Lower limits on the $\\ell\\ell qq$ contact\ninteraction scale are set between 16.7 TeV and 25.2 TeV, also depending on the\nmodel.\n", "  The properties of $\\isotope[12]{C}$, $\\isotope[16]{O}$, and\n$\\isotope[20]{Ne}$ nuclei in strong magnetic fields $B\\simeq 10^{17}\\,$G are\nstudied in the context of strongly magnetized neutron stars and white dwarfs.\nThe SKY3D code is extended to incorporate the interaction of nucleons with the\nmagnetic field and is utilized to solve the time-independent Hartree-Fock\nequations with a Skyrme interaction on a Cartesian three-dimensional grid. The\nnumerical solutions demonstrate a number of phenomena, which include a\nsplitting of the energy levels of spin-up and -down nucleons, spontaneous\nrearrangment of energy levels in $\\isotope[16]{O}$ at a critical field, which\nleads to jump-like increases of magnetization and proton current in this\nnucleus, and evolution of the intrinsically deformed $\\isotope[20]{Ne}$ nucleus\ntowards a more spherical shape under increasing field strength. Many of the\nnumerical features can be understood within a simple analytical model based on\nthe occupation by the nucleons of the lowest states of the harmonic oscillator\nin a magnetic field.\n", "  The spacetime geometry around astrophysical black holes is supposed to be\nwell approximated by the Kerr metric, but deviations from the Kerr solution are\npredicted in a number of scenarios involving new physics. Broad iron K$\\alpha$\nlines are commonly observed in the X-ray spectrum of black holes and originate\nby X-ray fluorescence of the inner accretion disk. The profile of the iron line\nis sensitively affected by the spacetime geometry in the strong gravity region\nand can be used to test the Kerr black hole hypothesis. In this paper, we\nextend previous work in the literature. In particular: i) as test-metric, we\nemploy the parametrization recently proposed by Konoplya, Rezzolla, and\nZhidenko, which has a number of subtle advantages with respect to the existing\napproaches; ii) we perform simulations with specific X-ray missions, and we\nconsider NuSTAR as a prototype of current observational facilities and eXTP as\nan example of the next generation of X-ray observatories. We find a significant\ndifference between the constraining power of NuSTAR and eXTP. With NuSTAR, it\nis difficult or impossible to constrain deviations from the Kerr metric. With\neXTP, in most cases we can obtain quite stringent constraints (modulo we have\nthe correct astrophysical model).\n", "  The inner region of the Milky Way halo harbors a large amount of dark matter\n(DM). Given its proximity, it is one of the most promising targets to look for\nDM. We report on a search for the annihilations of DM particles using\n$\\gamma$-ray observations towards the inner 300 parsecs of the Milky Way, with\nthe H.E.S.S. array of ground-based Cherenkov telescopes. The analysis is based\non a 2D maximum likelihood method using Galactic center (GC) data accumulated\nby H.E.S.S. over the last 10 years (2004-2014), and does not show any\nsignificant $\\gamma$-ray signal above background. Assuming Einasto and\nNavarro-Frenk-White DM density profiles at the GC, we derive upper limits on\nthe annihilation cross section $\\langle \\sigma v\\rangle$. These constraints are\nthe strongest obtained so far in the TeV DM mass range and improve upon\nprevious limits by a factor 5. For the Einasto profile, the constraints reach\n$\\langle \\sigma v\\rangle$ values of $\\rm 6\\times10^{-26} cm^3s^{-1}$ in the\n$W^+W^-$ channel for a DM particle mass of 1.5 TeV, and $\\rm 2\\times10^{-26}\ncm^3s^{-1}$ in the $\\tau^+\\tau^-$ channel for 1 TeV mass. For the first time,\nground-based $\\gamma$-ray observations have reached sufficient sensitivity to\nprobe $\\langle \\sigma v\\rangle$ values expected from the thermal relic density\nfor TeV DM particles.\n", "  Density waves are characteristic for fluidized beds and affect measurements\non liquid-like dynamics in fluidized granular media. Here, the intensity\nautocorrelation function as obtainable with diffusing-wave spectroscopy is\nderived in the presence of density waves. The predictions by the derived form\nof the IACF match experimental observations from a gas-fluidized bed. The model\nsuggests separability of the contribution from density waves from the\ncontribution by microscopic scatterer displacement to the decay of correlation,\nthus paves the way for characterizing microscopic particle motions using\ndiffusing-wave spectroscopy as well as heterogeneities in fluidized granular\nmedia.\n", "  We present nebular-phase imaging and spectroscopy for the hydrogen-poor\nsuperluminous supernova SN 2015bn, at redshift z=0.1136, spanning +250-400 d\nafter maximum light. The light curve exhibits a steepening in the decline rate\nfrom 1.4 mag/(100 d) to 1.7 mag/(100 d), suggestive of a significant decrease\nin the opacity. This change is accompanied by a transition from a blue\ncontinuum superposed with photospheric absorption lines to a nebular spectrum\ndominated by emission lines of oxygen, calcium and magnesium. There are no\nobvious signatures of circumstellar interaction or large nickel mass. We show\nthat the spectrum at +400 d is virtually identical to a number of energetic\nType Ic supernovae such as SN 1997dq, SN 2012au, and SN 1998bw, indicating\nsimilar core conditions and strengthening the link between `hypernovae'/long\ngamma-ray bursts and superluminous supernovae. A single explosion mechanism may\nunify these events that span absolute magnitudes of -22 < M_B < -17. Both the\nlight curve and spectrum of SN 2015bn are consistent with an engine-driven\nexplosion ejecting 7-30 M$_\\odot$ of oxygen-dominated ejecta (for reasonable\nchoices in temperature and opacity). A strong and relatively narrow O II\n$\\lambda$7774 line, seen in a number of these energetic events but not in\nnormal supernovae, may point to an inner shell that is the signature of a\ncentral engine.\n", "  We consider a two-dimensional model system of Brownian particles in which\nslow particles are accelerated while fast particles are damped. The motion of\nthe individual particles are described by a Langevin equation with\nRayleigh-Helmholtz velocity dependent friction. In case of noninteracting\nparticles, the time evolution equations lead to a non-Gaussian velocity\ndistribution. The velocity dependent friction allows negative values of the\nfriction or energy intakes by slow particles which we consider as active\nmotion, and also causes breaking of the fluctuation dissipation relation.\nDefining the effective temperature proportional to the second moment of\nvelocity, it is shown that for a constant effective temperature the higher the\nnoise strength, the lower are the number of active particles in the system.\nUsing the Mori-Zwanzig formalism and the mode-coupling approximation, the\nequation of motion for the density auto-correlation function are derived. The\nequations are solved using the equilibrium structure factors. The\nintegration-through-transients approach is used to derive a relation between\nthe structure factor in the stationary state considering the interacting\nforces, and the conventional equilibrium static structure factor.\n", "  The properties of the nonlinear frequency shift (NFS) especially the fluid\nNFS from the harmonic generation of the ion-acoustic wave (IAW) in multi-ion\nspecies plasmas have been researched by Vlasov simulation. The pictures of the\nnonlinear frequency shift from harmonic generation and particles trapping are\nshown to explain the mechanism of NFS qualitatively. The theoretical model of\nthe fluid NFS from harmonic generation in multi-ion species plasmas is given\nand the results of Vlasov simulation are consistent to the theoretical result\nof multi-ion species plasmas. When the wave number $k\\lambda_{De}$ is small,\nsuch as $k\\lambda_{De}=0.1$, the fluid NFS dominates in the total NFS and will\nreach as large as nearly $15\\%$ when the wave amplitude $|e\\phi/T_e|\\sim0.1$,\nwhich indicates that in the condition of small $k\\lambda_{De}$, the fluid NFS\ndominates in the saturation of stimulated Brillouin scattering especially when\nthe nonlinear IAW amplitude is large.\n", "  We have very little experience of the quantum dynamics of the ubiquitous\nnonlinear waves. Observed phenomena in high energy physics are perturbations to\nlinear waves, and classical nonlinear waves, like solitons, are barely affected\nby quantum effects. We know that solitons, immutable in classical physics,\nexhibit collapse and revivals according to quantum mechanics. However this\neffect is very weak and has never been observed experimentally. By predicting\nblack hole evaporation Hawking first introduced a distinctly quantum effect in\nnonlinear gravitational physics.Here we show the existence of a general and\nuniversal quantum process whereby a soliton emits quantum radiation with a\nspecific frequency content, and a temperature given by the number of quanta,\nthe soliton Schwarzschild radius, and the amount of nonlinearity, in a precise\nand surprisingly simple way. This result may ultimately lead to the first\nexperimental evidence of genuine quantum black hole evaporation. In addition,\nour results show that black hole radiation occurs in a fully quantised theory,\nat variance with the common approach based on quantum field theory in a curved\nbackground; this may provide insights into quantum gravity theories. Our\nfindings also have relevance to the entire field of nonlinear waves, including\ncold atomic gases and extreme phenomena such as shocks and rogue-waves.\nFinally, the predicted effect may potentially be exploited for novel tunable\nquantum light sources.\n", "  The usual identification of reactive trajectories for the calculation of\nreaction rates requires very time-consuming simulations, particularly if the\nenvironment presents memory effects. In this paper, we develop a new method\nthat permits the identification of reactive trajectories in a system under the\naction of a stochastic colored driving. This method is based on the\nperturbative computation of the invariant structures that act as separatrices\nfor reactivity. Furthermore, using this perturbative scheme, we have obtained a\nformally exact expression for the reaction rate in multidimensional systems\ncoupled to colored noisy environments.\n", "  Organolead halide perovskites are a family of hybrid organic-inorganic\ncompounds whose remarkable optoelectronic properties have been under intensive\nscrutiny in recent years. Here we use inelastic X-ray scattering to study\nlow-energy lattice excitations in single crystals of methylammonium lead iodide\nand bromide perovskites. Our findings confirm the displacive nature of the\ncubic-to-tetragonal phase transition, which is further shown, using neutron and\nx-ray diffraction, to be close to a tricritical point. Lastly, we detect\nquasistatic symmetry-breaking nanodomains persisting well into the\nhigh-temperature cubic phase, possibly stabilized by local defects. These\nfindings reveal key structural properties of these materials, and also bear\nimportant implications for carrier dynamics across an extended temperature\nrange relevant for photovoltaic applications.\n", "  We report the outcome of multifrequency radio observations of a double-double\nradio source J1706+4340 carried out with the Very Large Array and Giant\nMetrewave Radio Telescope. After supplementing our own data with those\navailable in the literature, we collected a considerable set of radio\nmeasurements covering the range from 74 to 8460 MHz. This has enabled us to\nperform a comprehensive review of physical properties of the source and its\ndynamical evolution analysis. In particular, we found that, while the age of\nthe large-scale outer lobes is in the range 260-300 Myr, the renewal of the jet\nactivity, which is directly responsible for the double-double structure, took\nplace only about 12 Myr ago after about 27-Myr long period of quiescence.\nAnother important property of J1706+4340 we found is that the injection\nspectral indices and the jet powers for the inner and the outer doubles are\nvery similar. This implies that it is the spin of the supermassive black hole\nrather than e.g. an instability of the accretion disc that is likely\nresponsible for the jet production and its properties.\n", "  The recent detection of gravitational waves by the LIGO/VIRGO team is an\nincredibly impressive achievement of experimental physics. It is also a\ntremendous success of the theory of General Relativity. It confirms the\nexistence of black holes; shows that binary black holes exist; that they may\ncollide and that during the merging process gravitational waves are produced.\nThese are all predictions of General Relativity theory in its fully nonlinear\nregime. The existence of gravitational waves was predicted by Albert Einstein\nin 1916 within the framework of linearized Einstein theory. Contrary to common\nbelief, even the very \\emph{definition} of a gravitational wave in the fully\nnonlinear Einstein theory was provided only after Einstein's death. Actually,\nEinstein had arguments against the existence of nonlinear gravitational waves\n(they were erroneous but he did not accept this), which virtually stopped\ndevelopment of the subject until the mid 1950s. This is what we refer to as the\n\\emph{Red Light} for gravitational waves research. In the following years, the\ntheme was picked up again and studied vigorously by various experts, mainly\nHerman Bondi, Felix Pirani, Ivor Robinson and Andrzej Trautman, where the\ntheoretical obstacles concerning gravitational wave existence were successfully\novercome, thus giving the `Green Light' for experimentalists to start designing\ndetectors, culminating in the recent LIGO/VIRGO discovery. In this note we tell\nthe story of this theoretical breakthrough. Particular attention is given to\nthe fundamental 1958 papers of Trautman, which seem to be lesser known outside\nthe circle of General Relativity experts. A more detailed technical description\nof these 2 papers is given in the Appendix.\n", "  Saturns rings are known to show remarkable real time variability in their\nstructure. Many of which can be associated to interactions with nearby moons\nand moonlets. Possibly the most interesting and dynamic place in the rings,\nprobably in the whole Solar System, is the F ring. A highly disrupted ring with\nlarge asymmetries both radially and azimuthally. Numerically non zero\ncomponents to the curl of the velocity vector field (vorticity) in the\nperturbed area of the F ring post encounter are witnessed, significantly above\nthe background vorticity. Within the perturbed area rich distributions of local\nrotations is seen located in and around the channel edges. The gravitational\nscattering of ring particles during the encounter causes a significant elevated\ncurl of the vector field above the background F ring vorticity for the first\n1-3 orbital periods post encounter. After 3 orbital periods vorticity reverts\nquite quickly to near background levels. This new found dynamical vortex life\nof the ring will be of great interest to planet and planetesimals in\nproto-planetary disks where vortices and turbulence are suspected of having a\nsignificant role in their formation and migrations. Additionally, it is found\nthat the immediate channel edges created by the close passage of Prometheus\nactually show high radial dispersions in the order ~20-50 cm/s, up to a maximum\nof 1 m/s. This is much greater than the value required by Toomre for a disk to\nbe unstable to the growth of axisymmetric oscillations. However, an area a few\nhundred km away from the edge shows a more promising location for the growth of\ncoherent objects.\n", "  Transition disks, protoplanetary disks with inner clearings, are promising\nobjects in which to directly image forming planets. The high contrast imaging\ntechnique of non-redundant masking is well posed to detect planetary mass\ncompanions at several to tens of AU in nearby transition disks. We present\nnon-redundant masking observations of the T Cha and LkCa 15 transition disks,\nboth of which host posited sub-stellar mass companions. However, due to a loss\nof information intrinsic to the technique, observations of extended sources\n(e.g. scattered light from disks) can be misinterpreted as moving companions.\nWe discuss tests to distinguish between these two scenarios, with applications\nto the T Cha and LkCa 15 observations. We argue that a static,\nforward-scattering disk can explain the T Cha data, while LkCa 15 is best\nexplained by multiple orbiting companions.\n", "  In ballistic transport, heat carriers such as phonons travel through the\nsolid without any scattering or interaction. Therefore, there is no temperature\ngradient in the solid, which seems to transport the heat without getting heated\nitself. Ballistic transport is typically seen in high purity crystals at either\ntemperatures below ~10 K, or physical size below ~100 nm, where the mean free\npath of the carrier is larger than the solid itself. In this letter, we show\nevidence of ballistic transport at room temperature in lithium niobate wafers\nin the in-plane and cross-plane directions under both steady state and high\nfrequency heating that are monitored using both infrared and resistance\nthermometry. We report phonon mean free path in lithium niobate around 425\nmicrons, which is about 50 times higher than the largest phonon mean free path\nin the literature at room temperature. Above this length-scale, temperature\ngradient gradually emerges and the material shows completely diffusive, bulk\ntransport at about 4 mm length. Our observations will impact phonon-based\nelectronics such as thermal transistor, thermal logic gate and memory currently\nimpossible at room temperature. If 1 micron electron mean free path in graphene\ngives the highest-mobility, the 425 microns mean free path of phonons in this\nresearch may realize phononics without any need for nanoscale size or\nultra-cold temperatures.\n", "  Extracting predictions from cosmological theories that describe a multiverse,\nfor what we are likely to observe in our domain, is crucial to establishing the\nvalidity of these theories. One way to extract such predictions is from\ntheory-generated probability distributions that allow for selection\neffects---generally expressed in terms of assumptions about anthropic\nconditionalization and how typical we are. In this paper, I urge three lessons\nabout typicality in multiverse settings. (i) Because it is difficult to\ncharacterize our observational situation in the multiverse, we cannot assume\nthat we are typical (as in the 'principle of mediocrity'): nor can we ignore\nthe issue of typicality, for it has a measurable impact on predictions for our\nobservations. (ii) There are spectra of assumptions about both\nconditionalization and typicality, which lead to coincident predictions for our\nobservations, leading to problems of confirmation in multiverse cosmology. And\nmoreover, (iii) when one has the freedom to consider competing theories of the\nmultiverse, the assumption of typicality may not lead to the highest\nlikelihoods for our observations. These three entwined aspects of typicality\nimply that positive assertions about our typicality, such as the 'principle of\nmediocrity', are more questionable than has been recently claimed.\n", "  The ideal Renaissance city is designed as a star-shaped fortress, where the\nstreets and squares are organized to speed the movement of people and soldiers.\nSymmetry and accessibility represent the key features for the organization of\nthe urban space. The resulting city is hierarchized and does not always\nguarantee an optimal degree of connectivity. Taking the baton from the work\ndone by space syntax in the definition of properties of spatial graph\nrepresentation, we introduce a method to compute urban graphs from the\nEuclidean representation, the corresponding line graph and the contraction of\nnodes with the same urban function. We analyze the urban graphs of five\nhistoric cities: Vitry le Fran\\c{c}ois, Avola, Neuf Brisach, Grammichele and\nPalmanova and compare the analysis restults with the corresponding results from\nspace syntax. Analysis of the spectral gap and the relative asymmetry\ndistribution show a similar structure for these cities. The irregular or\nreticular housing structure seems to ensure connectivity and accessibility more\nthan the regular grids. However connectivity is ensured by the most peripheral\nstreets, which in the space syntax representation play a marginal role.\n", "  We model the mass accretion rate $\\dot{M}$ to stellar mass $M_*$ correlation\nthat has been inferred from observations of intermediate to upper mass T Tauri\nstars---that is $\\dot{M} \\propto M_*^{1.3 \\pm 0.3}$. We explain this\ncorrelation within the framework of quiescent disk evolution, in which\naccretion is driven largely by gravitational torques acting in the bulk of the\nmass and volume of the disk. Stresses within the disk arise from the action of\ngravitationally driven torques parameterized in our 1D model in terms of\nToomre's $Q$ criterion. We do not model the hot inner sub-AU scale region of\nthe disk that is likely stable according to this criterion, and appeal to other\nmechanisms to remove or redistribute angular momentum and allow accretion onto\nthe star. Our model has the advantage of agreeing with large-scale\nangle-averaged values from more complex nonaxisymmetric calculations. The model\ndisk transitions from an early phase (dominated by initial conditions inherited\nfrom the burst mode of accretion) into a later self-similar mode characterized\nby a steeper temporal decline in $\\dot{M}$. The models effectively reproduce\nthe spread in mass accretion rates that have been observed for protostellar\nobjects of $0.2\\,\\mbox{M}_\\odot \\le M_* \\le 3.0\\,\\mbox{M}_\\odot$, such as those\nfound in the $\\rho$ Ophiuchus and Taurus star forming regions. We then compare\nrealistically sampled populations of young stellar objects produced by our\nmodel to their observational counterparts. We find these populations to be\nstatistically coincident, which we argue is evidence for the role of\ngravitational torques in the late time evolution of quiescent protostellar\ndisks.\n", "  We report Raman lasing and the optical analog of\nelectromagnetically-induced-transparency (EIT) in a whispering-gallerymode\n(WGM) microtoroid resonator embedded in a low refractive index polymer matrix\ntogether with a tapered fiber coupler. The Raman laser supports both single and\nmultimode operation with low power thresholds. Observations of Fano and\nEIT-like pheonomena in a packaged microresonator will enable high resolution\nsensors and can be used in networks where slow light process is needed. These\nresults open the way for portable, robust, and stable WGM microlasers and\nlaserbased sensors for applications in various environments.\n", "  Recently developed information communication technologies, particularly the\nInternet, have affected how we, both as individuals and as a society, create,\nstore, and recall information. Internet also provides us with a great\nopportunity to study memory using transactional large scale data, in a\nquantitative framework similar to the practice in statistical physics. In this\nproject, we make use of online data by analysing viewership statistics of\nWikipedia articles on aircraft crashes. We study the relation between recent\nevents and past events and particularly focus on understanding memory\ntriggering patterns. We devise a quantitative model that explains the flow of\nviewership from a current event to past events based on similarity in time,\ngeography, topic, and the hyperlink structure of Wikipedia articles. We show\nthat on average the secondary flow of attention to past events generated by\nsuch remembering processes is larger than the primary attention flow to the\ncurrent event. We are the first to report these cascading effects.\n", "  Recently, the structural controllability theory has been introduced to\nanalyze the Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) network. The indispensable nodes,\nwhich their removal increase the number of driver nodes to control the network,\nare found essential in PPI network. However, the PPI network is far from\ncomplete and there may exist many false-positive or false-negative\ninteractions, which promotes us to question: are these indispensable nodes\nrobust to structural change? Here we systematically investigate the robustness\nof indispensable nodes of PPI network by removing and adding possible\ninteractions. We found that the indispensable nodes are sensitive to the\nstructural change and very few edges can change the type of many indispensable\nnodes. The finding may promote our understanding to the control principle of\nPPI network.\n", "  This paper reports X-ray microtomographic visualization of the microorganism\nEscherichia coli overexpressing a metalloprotein ferritin. The\nthree-dimensional distribution of linear absorption coefficients determined\nusing a synchrotron radiation microtomograph with a simple projection geometry\nrevealed that the X-ray absorption was homogeneously distributed, suggesting\nthat every E. coli cell was labeled with the ferritin. The ferritin-expressing\nE. coli exhibited linear absorption coefficients comparable to those of\nphosphotungstic-acid stained cells. The submicrometer structure of the\nferritin-expressing E. coli cells was visualized by Zernike phase contrast\nusing an imaging microtomograph equipped with a Fresnel zone plate. The\nobtained images revealed curved columnar or bunching oval structures\ncorresponding to the E. coli cells. These results indicate that the\nmetalloprotein overexpression facilitates X-ray visualization of\nthree-dimensional cellular structures of biological objects.\n", "  This paper reports on the growth and characterization of hexagonal boron\nnitride (hBN) and its use for solid-state thermal neutron detection. The hBN\nepilayers were grown by metalorganic chemical vapor deposition on sapphire\nsubstrates at a temperature of 1350 C. X-ray diffraction peak from the (002)\nhBN plane at a 2theta angle of 26.7 deg exhibited the c-lattice constant of\n6.66 {\\AA} for these films. A strong peak corresponding to the high frequency\nRaman active mode of hBN was found for the films at 1370.5/cm. hBN-based\nsolid-state neutron detectors were fabricated and tested with a\nmetal-semiconductor-metal configuration with an electrode spacing of 1 mm and\nhBN thickness of 2.5 micron. Fabricated detectors showed strong response to\ndeep UV light as well. An intrinsic thermal neutron detection efficiency of\n0.86% was measured, which is close to the theoretically expected efficiency of\n0.87%. These results demonstrate that epitaxial hBN films are promising for\nthermal neutron detection applications.\n", "  The molecular mobility of glassy and supercooled liquid states of\nclotrimazole is studied using broadband dielectric spectroscopy for a wide\nrange of temperatures and frequency. The dielectric loss data of clotrimazole\nbelow T$_{g}$, do not show well resolved relaxation. Above T$_{g}$, dielectric\nloss show the structural $\\alpha$-relaxation which is reformed to shoulder like\nshape at high frequencies due to the secondary relaxation. The relaxation time\nof $\\alpha$-process, $\\tau_{\\alpha}$ follows Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann equation.\nThe glass transition temperature, $T_{g}$=296K and fragility index, m=50 are\nobtained from the thermal behaviour of the $\\alpha$-process. At temperature\nnear T$_{g}$ the dielectric loss has Kohlrausch-Williams-Watts stretch\nexponential parameter $\\beta_{KWW}$=0.56. The primitive relaxation time\nobtained from the coupling model coincides with the experimentally observed\nsecondary relaxation of clotrimazole. Hence the secondary relaxation is\nconsidered to be the Johari-Goldstein (JG) process which may be the precursor\n$\\alpha$-process. The value of exponent $\\beta_{KWW}$ increases with increase\nof temperature and scaled dielectric loss do not form as single master curve.\nThe structural relaxation $\\alpha$-relaxation and JG $\\beta$-relaxation process\nand its effects in clorimazole is discussed.\n", "  The prospect of RNA nanotechnology is increasing because of its numerous\npotential applications especially in medical science. The spherical\nNanodiamonds (NDs) are becoming popular because of their lesser toxicity,\ndesirable mechanical, optical properties, functionality and available surface\nareas. On other hand RNAs are stable, flexible and easy to bind to the NDs. In\nthis work, we have studied the tRNA dynamics on ND surface by high-resolution\nquasi-elastic neutron scattering spectroscopy and all atom molecular dynamics\nsimulation technique to understand how the tRNA motion is affected by the\npresence of ND. The flexibly of the tRNA is analyzed by the Mean square\ndisplacement analysis that shows tRNA have a sharp increase around 230K in its\nhydrated form. The intermediate scattering function (ISF) representing the tRNA\ndynamics follows the logarithmic decay as proposed by the Mode Coupling theory\n(MCT). But most importantly the tRNA dynamics is found to be faster in presence\nof ND within 220K to 310K compared to the freestanding ones. This is as we have\nshown, is because of the swollen RNA molecule due the introduction of\nhydrophilic ND surface.\n", "  The paper presents a memoir of 1931 written by Vito Volterra on the Italian\nphysicists of the nineteenth century and the researches these scientists made\nafter the discoveries of Michael Faraday on electromagnetism. Here, the memoir\nentitled \"I fisici italiani e le ricerche di Faraday\" is translated from\nItalian. It was written to commemorate the centenary of Faraday's discovery of\nthe electromagnetic induction. Besides being a remarkable article on the\nhistory of science, it was also, in a certain extent, a political paper. In\nfact, in 1931, the same year of the publication of this article, Mussolini\nimposed a mandatory oath of loyalty to Italian academies. Volterra was one of\nthe very few professors who refused to take this oath of loyalty. Because of\nthe political situation in Italy, Volterra wanted to end his paper sending a\nmessage to the scientists of the world, telling that the feeling of admiration\nand gratitude that in Italy the scientists had towards \"the great thinker and\nBritish experimentalist\" was profound and unanimous.\n", "  We theoretically study the effects of isotropic dissipation in a topological\nmechanical system which is an analogue of Chern insulator in mechanical\nvibrational lattice. The global gauge invariance is still conserved in this\nsystem albeit it is destroyed by the dissipation in the quantum counterpart.\nThe chiral edge states in this system are therefore robust against strong\ndissipation. The dissipation also causes a dispersion of damping for the\neigenstates. It will modify the equation of motion of a wave packet by an extra\neffective force. After taking into account the Berry curvature in the wave\nvector space, the trace of a free wave packet in the real space should be\ncurved, feinting to break the Newton's first law.\n", "  Human behaviors exhibit ubiquitous correlations in many aspects, such as\nindividual and collective levels, temporal and spatial dimensions, content,\nsocial and geographical layers. With rich Internet data of online behaviors\nbecoming available, it attracts academic interests to explore human mobility\nsimilarity from the perspective of social network proximity. Existent analysis\nshows a strong correlation between online social proximity and offline mobility\nsimilari- ty, namely, mobile records between friends are significantly more\nsimilar than between strangers, and those between friends with common neighbors\nare even more similar. We argue the importance of the number and diversity of\ncom- mon friends, with a counter intuitive finding that the number of common\nfriends has no positive impact on mobility similarity while the diversity plays\na key role, disagreeing with previous studies. Our analysis provides a novel\nview for better understanding the coupling between human online and offline\nbehaviors, and will help model and predict human behaviors based on social\nproximity.\n", "  It is shown that the unstable evolutions of the Hermite-Gauss-type stationary\nsolutions for the nonlocal nonlinear Schrodinger equation with the\nexponential-decay response function can evolve into chaotic states. This new\nkind of entities are referred to as chaoticons because they exhibit not only\nchaotic properties (with positive Lyapunov exponents and spatial decoherence)\nbut also soliton-like properties (with invariant statistic width and\ninteraction of quasi-elastic collisions).\n", "  We study mutually unbiased maximally entangled bases (MUMEB's) in bipartite\nsystem $\\mathbb{C}^d\\otimes\\mathbb{C}^d (d \\geq 3)$. We generalize the method\nto construct MUMEB's given in [16], by using any commutative ring $R$ with $d$\nelements and generic character of $(R,+)$ instead of\n$\\mathbb{Z}_d=\\mathbb{Z}/d\\mathbb{Z}$. Particularly, if\n$d=p_1^{a_1}p_2^{a_2}\\ldots p_s^{a_s}$ where $p_1, \\ldots, p_s$ are distinct\nprimes and $3\\leq p_1^{a_1}\\leq\\cdots\\leq p_s^{a_s}$, we present $p_1^{a_1}-1$\nMUMEB's in $\\mathbb{C}^d\\otimes\\mathbb{C}^d$ by taking\n$R=\\mathbb{F}_{p_1^{a_1}}\\oplus\\cdots\\oplus\\mathbb{F}_{p_s^{a_s}}$, direct sum\nof finite fields (Theorem 3.3).\n", "  The experimental realization of the quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect in\nmagnetically-doped (Bi, Sb)2Te3 films stands out as a landmark of modern\ncondensed matter physics. However, ultra-low temperatures down to few tens of\nmK are needed to reach the quantization of Hall resistance, which is two orders\nof magnitude lower than the ferromagnetic phase transition temperature of the\nfilms. Here, we systematically study the band structure of V-doped (Bi, Sb)2Te3\nthin films by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and show\nunambiguously that the bulk valence band (BVB) maximum lies higher in energy\nthan the surface state Dirac point. Our results demonstrate clear evidence that\nlocalization of BVB carriers plays an active role and can account for the\ntemperature discrepancy.\n", "  Quasi-periodic pulsations (or QPPs) are periodic intensity variations in the\nflare emission, across all wavelength bands. In this paper, we review the\nobservational and modelling achievements since the previous review on this\ntopic by Nakariakov & Melnikov (2009). In recent years, it has become clear\nthat QPPs are an inherent feature of solar flares, because almost all flares\nexhibit QPPs. Moreover, it is now firmly established that QPPs often show\nmultiple periods. We also review possible mechanisms for generating QPPs. Up to\nnow, it has not been possible to conclusively identify the triggering mechanism\nor cause of QPPs. The lack of this identification currently hampers possible\nseismological inferences of flare plasma parameters. QPPs in stellar flares\nhave been detected for a long time, and the high quality data of the Kepler\nmission allows to study the QPP more systematically. However, it has not been\nconclusively shown whether the time scales of stellar QPPs are different or the\nsame as those in solar flares.\n", "  We prove a time scales version of the Noether's theorem relating group of\nsymmetries and conservation laws. Our result extends the continuous version of\nthe Noether's theorem as well as the discrete one and corrects a previous\nstatement of Bartosiewicz and Torres in \\cite{BT}.\n", "  The size of the diameter of the Sun has been debated for a very long time.\nFirst tackled by the Greek astronomers from a geometric point of view, an\nestimate, although incorrect, has been determined, not truly called into\nquestion for several centuries. The French school of astronomy, under the\nimpetus of Mouton and Picard in the XVIIth century can be considered as a\npioneer in this issue. It was followed by the German school at the end of the\nXIXth century whose works led to a canonical value established at 959\".63\n(second of arc). A number of ground-based observations has been made in the\nsecond half of the XIXth century leading to controversial results mainly due to\nthe difficulty to disentangle between the solar and atmospheric effects.\nDedicated space measurements yield to a very faint dependence of the solar\ndiameter with time. New studies over the entire radiation spectrum lead to a\nclear relationship between the solar diameter and the wavelength, reflecting\nthe height at which the lines are formed. Thus the absolute value of the solar\ndiameter, which is a reference for many astrophysical applications, must be\nstated according to the wavelength. Furthermore, notable features of the Near\nSub-Surface Layer (NSSL), called the leptocline, can be established in relation\nto the solar limb variations, mainly through the shape asphericities\ncoefficients. The exact relationship has not been established yet, but recent\nstudies encourage further in-depth investigations of the solar subsurface\ndynamics, both observationally and by numerical MHD simulations.\n", "  The electronic structure of selected rare-earth atoms adsorbed on a\nfree-standing graphene was investigated using methods beyond the conventional\ndensity functional theory (DFT+U, DFT+HIA and DFT+ED). The influence of the\nelectron correlations and the spin-orbit coupling on the magnetic properties\nhas been examined. The DFT+U method predicts both atoms to carry local magnetic\nmoments (spin and orbital) contrary to a nonmagnetic $f^6$ ($J=0$) ground-state\nconfiguration of Sm in the gas phase. Application of DFT${}+{}$Hubbard-I (HIA)\nand DFT${}+{}$exact diagonalization (ED) methods cures this problem, and yields\na nonmagnetic ground state with six $f$ electrons and $J=0$ for the Sm adatom.\nOur calculations show that Nd adatom remains magnetic, with four localized $f$\nelectrons and $J=4.0$. These conclusions could be verified by STM and XAS\nexperiments.\n", "  The world's collective knowledge is evolving through research and new\nscientific discoveries. It is becoming increasingly difficult to objectively\nrank the impact research institutes have on global advancements. However, since\nthe funding, governmental support, staff and students quality all mirror the\nprojected quality of the institution, it becomes essential to measure the\naffiliation's rating in a transparent and widely accepted way. We propose and\ninvestigate several methods to rank affiliations based on the number of their\naccepted papers at future academic conferences. We carry out our investigation\nusing publicly available datasets such as the Microsoft Academic Graph, a\nheterogeneous graph which contains various information about academic papers.\nWe analyze several models, starting with a simple probabilities-based method\nand then gradually expand our training dataset, engineer many more features and\nuse mixed models and gradient boosted decision trees models to improve our\npredictions.\n", "  In this thesis I explore the generality of the holographic principle in 2+1\n(bulk) dimensions by looking at the possibility of having holographic\ncorrespondences for non-AdS (higher-spin) spacetimes. The first part focuses on\nLobachevsky spacetimes with $\\mathfrak{sl}(4,\\mathbb{R})$ as well as\n$\\mathcal{W}^{(2)}_N$ symmetries, the asymptotic symmetry algebras and their\nunitary representations. This results in a family of unitary\n$\\mathcal{W}^{(2)}_N$ models that can have both small and large central charge.\nThe focus of the second part is a possible holographic correspondence in\nasymptotically flat spacetimes. This part covers limits from known AdS$_3$\nresults to flat space as well as a NO-GO result that forbids having flat space,\nhigher-spins and unitarity at the same time. In addition this part shows how to\nconsistently add (higher-spin) chemical potentials to flat space. As a\nnon-trivial check of a holographic correspondence in flat space I provide a way\nto determine entanglement entropy (as well as thermal entropy of flat space\ncosmologies) holographically in asymptotically flat spacetimes using Wilson\nlines.\n", "  Granular material flowing through bottlenecks like the openings of silos tend\nto clog and to inhibit further flow. We study this phenomenon in a\nthree-dimensional hopper for spherical and shape-anisotropic particles by means\nof X-ray tomography. The X-ray tomograms provide information on the bulk of the\ngranular filling, and allows to determine the particle positions and\norientations inside the silo. In addition, it allows to calculate local packing\ndensities in different parts of the container. We find that in the flowing zone\nof the silo particles show a preferred orientation and thereby a higher order.\nSimilarly to simple shear flows, the average orientation of the particles is\nnot parallel to the streamlines but encloses a certain angle with it. In most\nparts of the hopper, the angular distribution of the particles did not reach\nthe one corresponding to stationary shear flow, thus the average orientation\nangle in the hopper deviates more from the streamlines than in stationary shear\nflows. In the flowing parts of the silo shear induced dilation is observed,\nwhich is more pronounced for elongated grains than for nearly spherical\nparticles. The clogged state is characterized by a dome, i. e. the geometry of\nthe layer of grains blocking the outflow. The shape of the dome depends on the\nparticle shape.\n", "  The desire to have a source of single entangled photon pairs can be satisfied\nusing single quantum dots as emitters. However, we are not bound to pursue only\npolarization entanglement, but can also exploit other degrees of freedom. In\nthis chapter we focus on the time degree of freedom, to achieve so-called\ntime-bin entanglement. This requires that we prepare the quantum dot coherently\ninto the biexciton state and also build special interferometers for analysis.\nFinally this technique can be extended to achieve time-bin and polarization\nhyper-entanglement from a suitable quantum dot.\n", "  The results of a careful analysis of all the available information on the\nactivities of Heisenberg and of his talks during the years 1939 to 1945 can be\nsummarized in the following way. Like several other German physicists\nHeisenberg was drafted by German Army Ordnance when war began in Europe in\nSeptember 1939 to investigate whether the energy from splitting Uranium nuclei\nby neutrons could be used for technical and military purposes. Heisenberg found\nthat this is possible in principle but that military use would require such\nenormous industrial expenditures that it would take many years and would be\nimpracticable while the war lasted. The project was therefore dropped by the\nNazi government in 1942. Heisenberg even refrained from calculating a precise\nvalue for the critical mass of U 235. He was relieved that he was thus spared a\nmoral decision between obeying an order to build the bomb or risking his life\nby refusing to be involved in the project or sabotaging it. He was happy to be\nconfined to a project of building a small test reactor under civilian\nadministration that the government had approved. In 1941 Heisenberg tried to\nget the opinion of Niels Bohr in Copenhagen on what the international community\nof nuclear physicist could possibly do or prevent regarding the long-range\ntechnical feasibility of making nuclear weapons. Bohr completely misunderstood\nthe cautious approach of Heisenberg.\n", "  Long-baseline interferometry (LBI) is used to reconstruct the image of faint\nthermal objects. The image quality, for a given exposure time, is in general\nlimited by a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). We show theoretically that a\nsignificant increase of the SNR, in a LBI, is possible by adding or subtracting\nphotons to the thermal beam. At low photon counts, photon addition-subtraction\ntechnology strongly enhances the image quality. We have experimentally realized\na nondeterministic physical protocol for photon subtraction. Our theoretical\npredictions are supported by experimental results.\n", "  We show that non-entangled polymers display an elastic-like behaviour at a\nmacroscopic scale (probed at some 0.100 mm thickness) up to at least hundred\ndegrees above the glass transition temperature. This observation, found under\nnon-slippage conditions, both for side-chain liquid crystalline polymers and\nordinary polymers, is in contradiction with the typically found flow behaviour\nof polymer melt. Our measurements were carried out with a conventional\nrheometer at thicknesses of several tenths millimetres. Thus, we were probing\nbulk properties. The observed elasticity supposedly implies that even in the\nmelt the chains experience a cohesive effect of macroscopic distances,\ninvolving collective motions over time scales longer than the individual\nrelaxation time of an individual polymer chain. The detection of such a\nsolid-like property of molten non-entangled polymers is of considerable\nimportance for a better understanding of the polymer dynamics.\n", "  We perform a complete study of prompt double $J/\\psi$ hadroproduction at\nleading order in the nonrelativistic-QCD factorization framework by including\nall possible pairings of the $c\\bar{c}$ Fock states ${}^1\\!S_0^{[8]}$,\n${}^3\\!S_1^{[1,8]}$, and ${}^3\\!P_J^{[1,8]}$ with $J=0,1,2$. We find that the\n${}^1\\!S_0^{[8]}$ and ${}^3\\!P_J^{[8]}$ channels of $J/\\psi$ and $\\psi^\\prime$\nproduction and the ${}^3\\!P_J^{[1]}$ and ${}^3\\!S_1^{[8]}$ channels of\n$\\chi_{cJ}$ production, which have been overlooked so far, greatly dominate at\nlarge invariant masses and rapidity separations of the $J/\\psi$ pair, and that\ntheir inclusion nearly fills the large gap between previous incomplete\npredictions within the color-singlet model and the recent measurement by the\nCMS Collaboration at the CERN LHC, leaving room for next-to-leading-order\ncorrections of typical size.\n", "  We address the problem of scattering and transmission of a plane flexural\nwave through a semi-infinite array of point scatterers/resonators, which take a\nvariety of physically interesting forms. The mathematical model accounts for\nseveral classes of point defects, including mass-spring resonators attached to\nthe top surface of the flexural plate and their limiting case of concentrated\npoint masses. We also analyse the special case of resonators attached to\nopposite faces of the plate. The problem is reduced to a functional equation of\nthe Wiener-Hopf type, whose kernel varies with the type of scatterer\nconsidered. A novel approach, which stems from the direct connection between\nthe kernel function of the semi-infinite system and the quasi-periodic Green's\nfunctions for corresponding infinite systems, is used to identify special\nfrequency regimes. We thereby demonstrate dynamically anisotropic wave effects\nin semi-infinite platonic crystals, with particular attention paid to designing\nsystems to exhibit dynamic neutrality (perfect transmission) and localisation\nclose to the structured interface.\n", "  We investigate the gluon transverse momentum dependent correlators as Fourier\ntransform of matrix elements of nonlocal operator combinations. At the operator\nlevel these correlators include both field strength operators and gauge links\nbridging the nonlocality. In contrast to the collinear PDFs, the gauge links\nare no longer unique for transverse momentum dependent PDFs (TMDs) and also\nWilson loops lead to nontrivial effects. We look at gluon TMDs for unpolarized,\nvector and tensor polarized targets. In particular a single Wilson loop\noperators become important when one considers the small-x limit of gluon TMDs.\n", "  Induced earthquakes often accompany fluid injection, and the seismic hazard\nthey pose threatens various underground engineering projects. Models to monitor\nand control induced seismic hazard with traffic light systems should be\nprobabilistic, forward-looking, and updated as new data arrive. In this study,\nwe propose an Induced Seismicity Test Bench to test and rank such models; this\ntest bench can be used for model development, model selection, and ensemble\nmodel building. We apply the test bench to data from the Basel 2006 and\nSoultz-sous-For\\^ets 2004 geothermal stimulation projects, and we assess\nforecasts from two models: Shapiro and Smoothed Seismicity (SaSS) and\nHydraulics and Seismics (HySei). These models incorporate a different mix of\nphysics-based elements and stochastic representation of the induced sequences.\nOur results show that neither model is fully superior to the other. Generally,\nHySei forecasts the seismicity rate better after shut-in, but is only mediocre\nat forecasting the spatial distribution. On the other hand, SaSS forecasts the\nspatial distribution better and gives better seismicity rate estimates before\nshut-in. The shut-in phase is a difficult moment for both models in both\nreservoirs: the models tend to underpredict the seismicity rate around, and\nshortly after, shut-in.\n", "  We describe a protocol by which an imaging system could be protected against\njamming by a malevolent party. Our protocol not only allows recognition of the\njamming, but also allows for the recovery of the true image from the jammed\none. We apply the method to jamming of quantum ghost imaging, for which the\njamming detection probability is increased when the imaging light is entangled.\nThe method can also be used to provide image recovery in general noisy\nenvironments.\n", "  Even today, the convergence of the decay widths and some of the Dalitz plot\nparameters of the $\\eta $$\\,\\rightarrow $$3\\pi$ decays seems problematic in low\nenergy QCD. We provide an overview of the current experimental and theoretical\nsituation with historical background and summarize our recent results, which\nexplore the question of compatibility of experimental data with a reasonable\nconvergence of a carefully defined chiral series in the framework of resummed\nchiral perturbation theory.\n", "  We propose a new geometrical model of matter, in which neutral atoms are\nmodelled by compact, complex algebraic surfaces. Proton and neutron numbers are\ndetermined by a surface's Chern numbers. Equivalently, they are determined by\ncombinations of the Hodge numbers, or the Betti numbers. Geometrical\nconstraints on algebraic surfaces allow just a finite range of neutron numbers\nfor a given proton number. This range encompasses the known isotopes.\n", "  The entanglement and R\\'{e}nyi entropies for spherical entangling surfaces in\nCFTs with gravity duals can be explicitly calculated by mapping these entropies\nfirst to the thermal entropy on hyperbolic space and then, using the AdS/CFT\ncorrespondence, to the Wald entropy of topological black holes. Here we extend\nthis idea by taking into account corrections to the Wald entropy. Using the\nmethod based on horizon symmetries and the asymptotic Cardy formula, we\ncalculate corrections to the Wald entropy and find that these corrections are\nproportional to the logarithm of horizon area. With the corrected black hole\nentropy expression, we then find corrections to the R\\'{e}nyi entropies. We\ncalculate these corrections for both Einstein as well as Gauss-Bonnet gravity\nduals. Corrections with logarithmic dependence on the area of the entangling\nsurface naturally occur at the order $G_{D}^0$ and it seems to be a general\nfeature of entanglement and R\\'{e}nyi entropies for CFTs with gravity duals. In\nparticular, there is a logarithmic correction to the entropy in odd boundary\nspacetime dimensions as well.\n", "  We define an explicit quasi-local mass functional which is non-decreasing\nalong all foliations (satisfying a convexity assumption) of null cones. We use\nthis new functional to prove the null Penrose conjecture under fairly generic\nconditions.\n", "  We theoretically investigate an ensemble of three-level room-temperature\natoms in a two-mode optical cavity, focusing on the case of counterpropagating\nlight fields. We find that in the limit of large detunings the problem admits\nrelatively simple and intuitive solutions. When a classical field drives one of\nthe transitions, the system becomes equivalent to an ensemble of two-level\natoms with suppressed Doppler broadening. In contrast, when the same transition\nis driven with a single photon, the system collectively behaves like a single\ntwo-level atom. This latter result is particularly relevant in the context of\nquantum nonlinear optics.\n", "  A boson of spin-j>1 can be described in one of the possibilities within the\nBargmann-Wigner framework by means of one sole differential equation of order\ntwice the spin, which however is known to be inconsistent as it allows for\nnon-local, ghost and acausally propagating solutions, all problems which are\ndifficult to tackle. The other possibility is provided by the Fierz-Pauli\nframework which is based on the more comfortable to deal with second order\nKlein-Gordon equation, but it needs to be supplemented by an auxiliary\ncondition. Although the latter formalism avoids some of the pathologies of the\nhigh-order equations, it still remains plagued by some inconsistencies such as\nthe acausal propagation of the wave fronts of the (classical) solutions within\nan electromagnetic environment. We here suggest a method alternative to the\nabove two that combines their advantages while avoiding the related\ndifficulties. Namely, we suggest one sole strictly (j,0)+ (0,j) representation\nspecific second order differential equation, which is derivable from a\nLagrangian and whose solutions do not violate causality. The equation under\ndiscussion presents itself as the product of the Klein-Gordon operator with a\nmomentum independent projector on Lorentz irreducible representation spaces\nconstructed from one of the Casimir invariants of the spin-Lorentz group. The\nbasis used is that of general tensor-spinors of rank-2j.\n", "  This paper is the first part of a two-fold study of mixing, i.e. the\nformation of layers and upwelling of buoyancy, in axially stratified\nTaylor--Couette flow, with fixed outer cylinder. Using linear analysis and\ndirect numerical simulation, we show the critical role played by\nnon-axisymmetric instability modes, despite the fact that the flow is\ncentrifugally unstable in the sense of Rayleigh's criterion. Interactions\nbetween helical modes of opposite handedness leads to the formation of\nnonlinear coherent structures: (mixed)-ribbons and (mixed)-cross-spirals. These\ngive birth to complex density interface patterns, seemingly appearing and\ndisappearing periodically as the coherent structure slowly rotates around the\nannulus. These coherent structures seem to be responsible for the formation of\nlayers reported in a recent experiment by Oglethorpe et al. (2013). We\ndistinguish `dynamic layering', instantaneous, localized and caused by the\nvortical motions, from `static layering' corresponding to the formation of a\n`staircase profile' in the adiabatically sorted background density. The latter\nonly occurs at large enough Schmidt number, revealing the significant impact of\nthe Schmidt number in the layering process.\n", "  This paper is the second part of a two-fold study of mixing, i.e. the\nformation of layers and upwelling of buoyancy, in axially stratified\nTaylor--Couette flow, with fixed outer cylinder. In a first paper, we showed\nthat the dynamics of the flow was dominated by coherent structures made of a\nsuperposition of nonlinear waves. (Mixed)-ribbons and (mixed)-cross-spirals are\ngenerated by interactions between a pair of linearly unstable helical modes of\nopposite `handedness', and appear to be responsible for the formation of\nwell-mixed layers and sharp density interfaces. In this paper, we show that\nthese structures are also fully accountable for the upwards buoyancy flux in\nthe simulations. The mechanism by which this occurs is a positive coupling\nbetween the density and vertical velocity components of the most energetic\nwaves. This coupling is primarily caused by diffusion of density at low Schmidt\nnumber Sc, but can also be a nonlinear effect at larger Sc. Turbulence was\nfound to contribute negatively to the buoyancy flux at Sc=1,10,16, which lead\nto the conclusion that mass upwelling is a consequence of chaotic advection,\neven at large Reynolds number. Artificially isolating the coherent structure\ntherefore leads to excellent estimates of the flux Richardson numbers Ri_f from\nthe DNS. We also used the theoretical framework of Winters et al. (1995) to\nanalyse the energetics of mixing in an open control volume, shedding light on\nthe influence of end effects in the potential energy budget. The potential\nconnection with the buoyancy flux measurements made in the recent experiment of\nOglethorpe et al. (2013) is also discussed.\n", "  Inequalities for the eigenvalues of the (negative) Laplacian subject to mixed\nboundary conditions on polyhedral and more general bounded domains are\nestablished. The eigenvalues subject to a Dirichlet boundary condition on a\npart of the boundary and a Neumann boundary condition on the remainder of the\nboundary are estimated in terms of either Dirichlet or Neumann eigenvalues. The\nresults complement several classical inequalities between Dirichlet and Neumann\neigenvalues due to P\\'{o}lya, Payne, Levine and Weinberger, Friedlander, and\nothers.\n", "  Spectral methods are popular in detecting global structures in the given data\nthat can be represented as a matrix. However when the data matrix is sparse or\nnoisy, classic spectral methods usually fail to work, due to localization of\neigenvectors (or singular vectors) induced by the sparsity or noise. In this\nwork, we propose a general method to solve the localization problem by learning\na regularization matrix from the localized eigenvectors. Using matrix\nperturbation analysis, we demonstrate that the learned regularizations suppress\ndown the eigenvalues associated with localized eigenvectors and enable us to\nrecover the informative eigenvectors representing the global structure. We show\napplications of our method in several inference problems: community detection\nin networks, clustering from pairwise similarities, rank estimation and matrix\ncompletion problems. Using extensive experiments, we illustrate that our method\nsolves the localization problem and works down to the theoretical detectability\nlimits in different kinds of synthetic data. This is in contrast with existing\nspectral algorithms based on data matrix, non-backtracking matrix, Laplacians\nand those with rank-one regularizations, which perform poorly in the sparse\ncase with noise.\n"]}
