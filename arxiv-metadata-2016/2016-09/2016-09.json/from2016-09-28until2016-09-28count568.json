concept proposed by Chattaraj et al.\n(Chattaraj, P. K.; Maiti, B.; Sarkar, U. J. Phys. Chem. A. 2003, 107, 4973) and\na dual descriptor derived by Toro-Labbe and coworkers (Morell, C.; Grand, A.;\nToro-Labbe, A. J. Phys. Chem. A. 2005, 109, 205), we propose a multiphilic\ndescriptor. It is defined as the difference between nucleophilic (Wk+) and\nelectrophilic (Wk-) condensed philicity functions. This descriptor is capable\nof simultaneously explaining the nucleophilicity and electrophilicity of the\ngiven atomic sites in the molecule. Variation of these quantities along the\npath of a soft reaction is also analyzed. Predictive ability of this descriptor\nhas been successfully tested on the selected systems and reactions.\nCorresponding force profiles are also analyzed in some representative cases.\nAlso, to study the intra- and intermolecular reactivities another related\ndescriptor namely, the nucleophilicity excess (DelW-+) for a nucleophile, over\nthe electrophilicity in it has been defined and tested on all-metal aromatic\ncompounds.\n", "  The influence of excited-state absorption (ESA) and two-exciton processes on\na coherent population transfer with intense ultrashort chirped pulses in\nmolecular systems in solution has been studied. An unified treatment of\nadiabatic rapid passage (ARP) in such systems has been developed using a\nthree-state electronic system with relaxation treated as a diffusion on\nelectronic potential energy surfaces. We have shown that ESA has a profound\neffect on coherent population transfer in large molecules that necessitates a\nmore accurate interpretation of experimental data. A simple and physically\nclear model for ARP in molecules with three electronic states in solution has\nbeen developed by extending the Landau-Zener calculations putting in a third\nlevel to random crossing of levels. A method for quantum control of two-exciton\nstates in molecular complexes has been proposed.\n", "  We present systematic results, based on density functional calculations, for\nthe structure and energetics of $^3$He and $^4$He nanodroplets doped with\nalkaline earth atoms. We predict that alkaline earth atoms from Mg to Ba go to\nthe center of $^3$He drops, whereas Ca, Sr, and Ba reside in a deep dimple at\nthe surface of $^4$He drops, and Mg is at their center. For Ca and Sr, the\nstructure of the dimples is shown to be very sensitive to the He-alkaline earth\npair potentials used in the calculations. The $5s5p\\leftarrow5s^2$ transition\nof strontium atoms attached to helium nanodroplets of either isotope has been\nprobed in absorption experiments. The spectra show that strontium is solvated\ninside $^3$He nanodroplets, supporting the calculations. In the light of our\nfindings, we emphasize the relevance of the heavier alkaline earth atoms for\nanalyzing mixed $^3$He-$^4$He nanodroplets, and in particular, we suggest their\nuse to experimentally probe the $^3$He-$^4$He interface.\n", "  We illustrate the main features of a recently proposed method based on\nensemble density functional theory to divide rigorously a complex molecular\nsystem into its parts [M.H. Cohen and A. Wasserman, J. Phys. Chem. A 111, 2229\n(2007)]. The illustrative system is an analog of the hydrogen molecule for\nwhich analytic expressions for the densities of the parts (hydrogen \"atoms\")\nare found along with the \"reactivity potential\" that enters the theory. While\nprevious formulations of Chemical Reactivity Theory lead to zero, or undefined,\nvalues for the chemical hardness of the isolated parts, we demonstrate they can\nacquire a finite and positive hardness within the present formulation.\n", "  In this communication we analyze the stability, reactivity and possible\naromatic behavior of two recently reported clusters (Reveles J. U.; Khanna S.\nN.; Roach P. J.; Castleman A. W. jr. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci, 2006, 103, 18405),\nviz., Al7C- and Al7O- in the light of the principles of the maximum hardness\nand minimum electrophilicity as well as the nucleus independent chemical shift\nvalues.\n", "  Ab initio computed interaction forces are employed in order to describe the\nmicrosolvation of the A$_2^+(^2\\Sigma)$ (A=Li,Na,K) molecular ion in $^4$He\nclusters of small variable size. The minimum energy structures are obtained by\nperforming energy minimization based on a genetic algorithm approach. The\nsymmetry features of the collocation of solvent adatoms around the dimeric\ncation are analyzed in detail, showing that the selective growth of small\nclusters around the two sides of the ion during the solvation process is a\nfeature common to all three dopants.\n", "  In this work, we revisit the electron transfer rate theory, with particular\ninterests in the distinct quantum solvation effect, and the characterizations\nof adiabatic/nonadiabatic and Markovian/non-Markovian rate processes. We first\npresent a full account for the quantum solvation effect on the electron\ntransfer in Debye solvents, addressed previously in J. Theore. & Comput. Chem.\n{\\bf 5}, 685 (2006). Distinct reaction mechanisms, including the quantum\nsolvation-induced transitions from barrier-crossing to tunneling, and from\nbarrierless to quantum barrier-crossing rate processes, are shown in the fast\nmodulation or low viscosity regime. This regime is also found in favor of\nnonadiabatic rate processes. We further propose to use Kubo's motional\nnarrowing line shape function to describe the Markovian character of the\nreaction. It is found that a non-Markovian rate process is most likely to occur\nin a symmetric system in the fast modulation regime, where the electron\ntransfer is dominant by tunneling due to the Fermi resonance.\n", "  The computation of vibrational spectra of diatomic molecules through the\nexact diagonalization of algebraically determined matrixes based on powers of\nMorse coordinates is made substantially more efficient by choosing a properly\nadapted quantum-mechanical basis, specifically tuned to the molecular\npotential. A substantial improvement is achieved while still retaining the full\nadvantage of the simplicity and numerical light-weightedness of an algebraic\napproach. In the scheme we propose, the basis is parameterized by two\nquantities which can be adjusted to best suit the molecular potential through a\nsimple minimization procedure.\n", "  The first clue, in the theory of relativity, the 4-vector force acting on a\nparticle is orthogonal to the 4-vector velocity of the particle, this\northogonality means that there is some difference between the orthogonality and\nthe usual statement: the Coulomb's force (or gravitational force) acts along\nthe line joining a couple of particles (in usual 3D space), so the direction of\n4-vector Coulomb's force is carefully investigated, it is found that Maxwell's\nequations can be derived from classical Coulomb's force and the orthogonality.\nThe second clue, a 4-vector force has 4 components, because of the\northogonality of 4-vector force and 4-vector velocity, the number of\nindependent components of the 4-vector force reduces to 3, however we prove\nthat 4-vector Coulomb's force can merely provide 2 independent components, this\nsituation means that there is an undefined component accompanying the 4-vector\nCoulomb's force, hinting that this missing undefined component is a hidden\nvariable. The third clue, the best way to study the hidden variable is to\nestablish a new concept: Z-space, in which the undefined component of 4-vector\nCoulomb's force can be clearly defined as the hidden variable for the quantum\nmechanics. At the last, the undefined component is regarded as a fluctuating\nsource that contributes to Lorentz force, so that the quantum wave equation can\nbe derived out in the ensemble space of particle motion from the relativistic\nNewton's second law.\n", "  A kinetic theory of homogeneous crystal nucleation in unary droplets is\npresented taking into account that a crystal nucleus can form not only in the\nvolume-based mode (with all its facets within the droplet) but also in the\nsurface-stimulated one (with one of its facets at the droplet surface). The\npreviously developed thermodynamics of surface-stimulated crystal nucleation\nrigorously showed that if at least one of the facets of the crystal is only\npartially wettable by its melt, then it is thermodynamically more favorable for\nthe nucleus to form with that facet at the droplet surface rather than within\nthe droplet. So far, however, the kinetic aspects of this phenomenon had not\nbeen studied at all. The theory proposed in the present paper advocates that\neven in the surface-stimulated mode crystal nuclei initially emerge (as\nsub-critical clusters) homogeneously in the sub-surface layer, not\n\"pseudo-heterogeneously\" at the surface. A homogeneously emerged sub-critical\ncrystal can become a surface-stimulated nucleus due to density and structure\nfluctuations. This effect contributes to the total rate of crystal nucleation\n(as the volume-based mode does). An explicit expression for the total\nper-particle rate of crystal nucleation is derived. Numerical evaluations for\nwater droplets suggest that the surface-stimulated mode can significantly\nenhance the per-particle rate of crystal nucleation in droplets as large as 10\nmicrons in radius. Possible experimental verification of the proposed theory is\ndiscussed.\n", "  One of most intriguing problems of heterogeneous crystal nucleation in\ndroplets is its strong enhancement in the contact mode (when the foreign\nparticle is presumably in some kind of contact with the droplet surface)\ncompared to the immersion mode (particle immersed in the droplet). Many\nheterogeneous centers have different nucleation thresholds when they act in\ncontact or immersion modes, indicating that the mechanisms may be actually\ndifferent for the different modes. Underlying physical reasons for this\nenhancement have remained largely unclear. In this paper we present a model for\nthe thermodynamic enhancement of heterogeneous crystal nucleation in the\ncontact mode compared to the immersion one. To determine if and how the surface\nof a liquid droplet can thermodynamically stimulate its heterogeneous\ncrystallization, we examine crystal nucleation in the immersion and contact\nmodes by deriving and comparing with each other the reversible works of\nformation of crystal nuclei in these cases. As a numerical illustration, the\nproposed model is applied to the heterogeneous nucleation of Ih crystals on\ngeneric macroscopic foreign particles in water droplets at T=253 K. Our results\nshow that the droplet surface does thermodynamically favor the contact mode\nover the immersion one. Surprisingly, our numerical evaluations suggest that\nthe line tension contribution to this enhancement from the contact of three\nwater phases (vapor-liquid-crystal) may be of the same order of magnitude as or\neven larger than the surface tension contribution.\n", "  Rescattering electrons offer great potential as probes of molecular\nproperties on ultrafast timescales. The most famous example is molecular\ntomography, in which high harmonic spectra of oriented molecules are mapped to\n``tomographic images'' of the relevant molecular orbitals. The accuracy of such\nreconstructions may be greatly affected by the distortion of scattering\nwavefunctions from their asymptotic forms due to interactions with the parent\nion. We investigate the validity of the commonly used plane wave approximation\nin molecular tomography, showing how such distortions affect the resulting\norbital reconstructions.\n", "  It is known for quite some time that approximate density functional (ADF)\ntheories fail disastrously when describing the dis-sociative symmetric radical\ncations R2+. Considering this dissociation limit, previous work has shown that\nHartree-Fock (HF) theory favors the R+1--R0 charge distribution while DF\napproximations favor the R+0.5 -- R+0.5. Yet, general quantum mechanical\nprinciples indicate that both these (as well as all intermediate) average\ncharge distributions are asymptotically energy degenerate. Thus HF and ADF\ntheories mistakenly break the symmetry but in a contradicting way. In this\nletter we show how to construct system-dependent long-range corrected (LC)\ndensity functionals that can successfully treat this class of molecules,\navoiding the spurious symmetry breaking. Examples and comparisons to\nexperimental data is given for R=H, He and Ne and it is shown that the new LC\ntheory improves considerably the theoretical description of the R2+ bond\nproperties, the long range form of the asymptotic potential curve as well as\nthe atomic polarizability. The broader impact of this finding is discussed as\nwell and it is argued that the widespread semi-empirical approach which\nadvocates treating the LC parameter as a system-independent parameter is in\nfact inappropriate under general circumstances.\n", "  The evaporation coefficients of water in air and nitrogen were found as a\nfunction of temperature, by studying the evaporation of pure water droplet. The\ndroplet was levitated in an electrodynamic trap placed in a climatic chamber\nmaintaining atmospheric pressure. Droplet radius evolution and evaporation\ndynamics were studied with high precision by analyzing the angle-resolved light\nscattering Mie interference patterns. A model of quasi-stationary droplet\nevolution, accounting for the kinetic effects near the droplet surface was\napplied. In particular, the effect of thermal effusion (a short range analogue\nof thermal diffusion) was discussed and accounted for. The evaporation\ncoefficient \\alpha in air and in nitrogen were found equal. \\alpha was found to\ndecrease from ~ 0.18 to ~ 0.13 for the temperature range from 273.1 K to 293.1\nK and follow the trend given by Arrhenius formula. The agreement with\ncondensation coefficient values obtained with essentially different method by\nLi et al.[1] was found excellent. The comparison of experimental conditions\nused in both methods revealed no dependence of evaporation/condensation\ncoefficient upon droplet charge nor ambient gas pressure within experimental\nparameters range. The average value of thermal accommodation coefficient over\nthe same temperature range was found to be 1 \\pm 0.05.\n", "  We have studied the structure and properties of potassium clusters containing\neven number of atoms ranging from 2 to 20 at the ab initio level. The geometry\noptimization calculations are performed using all-electron density functional\ntheory with gradient corrected exchange-correlation functional. Using these\noptimized geometries we investigate the evolution of binding energy, ionization\npotential, and static polarizability with the increasing size of the clusters.\nThe polarizabilities are calculated by employing Moller-Plesset perturbation\ntheory and time dependent density functional theory. The polarizabilities of\ndimer and tetramer are also calculated by employing large basis set coupled\ncluster theory with single and double excitations and perturbative triple\nexcitations. The time dependent density functional theory calculations of\npolarizabilities are carried out with two different exchange-correlation\npotentials: (i) an asymptotically correct model potential and (ii) within the\nlocal density approximation. A systematic comparison with the other available\ntheoretical and experimental data for various properties of small potassium\nclusters mentioned above has been performed. These comparisons reveal that both\nthe binding energy and the ionization potential obtained with gradient\ncorrected potential match quite well with the already published data.\nSimilarly, the polarizabilities obtained with Moller-Plesset perturbation\ntheory and with model potential are quite close to each other and also close to\nexperimental data.\n", "  We report nanosecond time-resolved photoluminescence measurements on the\nisoelectronic series of oxygen deficient centers in amorphous silica,\nSi-ODC(II), Ge-ODC(II) and Sn-ODC(II) which are responsible of fluorescence\nactivities at $\\sim$4 eV under excitation at $\\sim$5 eV. The dependence of the\nfirst moment of their emission band on time, and that of the radiative decay\nlifetime on emission energy are analyzed within a theoretical model able to\ndescribe the effects introduced by disorder on the optical properties of the\ndefects. We obtain separate estimates of the homogeneous and inhomogeneous\ncontributions to the measured emission linewidth and we derive homogeneous\nspectroscopic features of the investigated point defects (Huangh-Rhys factor,\nhomogeneous width, oscillator strength, vibrational frequency). The results\npoint to a picture in which an oxygen deficient center localized on a heavier\natom features a higher degree of inhomogeneity due to stronger local distortion\nof the surrounding matrix. For Si, Ge, Sn related defects the parameter\n$\\lambda$, able to quantify inhomogeneity, results to be 65, 78 and 90$%,\nrespectively.\n", "  We report on a form of gas-phase anion action spectroscopy based on infrared\nmultiple photon electron detachment and subsequent capture of the free\nelectrons by a neutral electron scavenger in a Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron\nResonance (FTICR) mass spectrometer. This method allows one to obtain\nbackground-free spectra of strongly bound anions, for which no dissociation\nchannels are observed. The first gas-phase spectra of acetate and propionate\nare presented using SF6 as electron scavenger and a free electron laser as\nsource of intense and tunable infrared radiation. To validate the method, we\ncompare infrared spectra obtained through multiple photon electron\ndetachment/attachment and multiple photon dissociation for the benzoate anion.\nIn addition, different electron acceptors are used, comparing both associative\nand dissociative electron capture. The relative energies of dissociation (by\nCO2 loss) and electron detachment are investigated for all three anions by DFT\nand CCSD(T) methods. DFT calculations are also employed to predict vibrational\nfrequencies, which provide a good fit to the infrared spectra observed. The\nfrequencies of the symmetric and antisymmetric carboxylate stretching modes for\nthe aliphatic carboxylates are compared to those previously observed in\ncondensed-phase IR spectra and to those reported for gas-phase benzoate,\nshowing a strong influence of the solution environment and a slight substituent\neffect on the antisymmetric stretch.\n", "  Dynamical simulations of polaron transport in conjugated polymers in the\npresence of an external time-dependent electric field have been performed\nwithin a combined extended Hubbard model (EHM) and Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH)\nmodel. Nearly all relevant electron-phonon and electron-electron interactions\nare fully taken into account by solving the time-dependent Schr\\\"{o}dinger\nequation for the $\\pi$-electrons and the Newton's equation of motion for the\nbackbone monomer displacements by virtue of the combination of the adaptive\ntime-dependent density matrix renormalization group (TDDMRG) and classical\nmolecular dynamics (MD). We find that after a smooth turn-on of the external\nelectric field the polaron is accelerated at first and then moves with a nearly\nconstant velocity as one entity consisting of both the charge and the lattice\ndeformation. An ohmic region (3 mV/$\\text{\\AA}$ $\\leq E_0\\leq$ 9\nmV/$\\text{\\AA}$) where the stationary velocity increases linearly with the\nelectric field strength is observed for the case of $U$=2.0 eV and $V$=1.0 eV.\nThe maximal velocity is well above the speed of sound. Below 3 mV/$\\text{\\AA}$\nthe polaron velocity increases nonlinearly and in high electric fields with\nstrength $E_0\\geq$ 10.0 mV/$\\text{\\AA}$ the polaron will become unstable and\ndissociate. The relationship between electron-electron interaction strengths\nand polaron transport is also studied in detail. We find that the the on-site\nCoulomb interactions $U$ will suppress the polaron transport and small\nnearest-neighbor interactions $V$ values are also not beneficial to the\npolaronic motion while large $V$ values favor the polaron transport.\n", "  The recently proposed Partition Theory (PT) [J.Phys.Chem.A 111, 2229 (2007)]\nis illustrated on a simple one-dimensional model of a heteronuclear diatomic\nmolecule. It is shown that a sharp definition for the charge of molecular\nfragments emerges from PT, and that the ensuing population analysis can be used\nto study how charge redistributes during dissociation and the implications of\nthat redistribution for the dipole moment. Interpreting small differences\nbetween the isolated parts' ionization potentials as due to environmental\ninhomogeneities, we gain insight into how electron localization takes place in\nH2+ as the molecule dissociates. Furthermore, by studying the preservation of\nthe shapes of the parts as different parameters of the model are varied, we\naddress the issue of transferability of the parts. We find good transferability\nwithin the chemically meaningful parameter regime, raising hopes that PT will\nprove useful in chemical applications.\n", "  We have carried out extensive density functional calculations for series of\nsodium clusters $Na$$_{N}$ ranging from $N$=10 to 147 and have obtained\n$\\approx$ 13000 distinct isomers. We unravel a number of striking features of\nthe growth characteristics. The growth shows order-disorder-order pattern of\ncyclic nature. Between two ordered clusters the growth proceeds via disordered\nclusters having multi-centered icosahedral local order. The Global order\nemerges suddenly with the addition of one or two atoms only. The clusters\naround $N$=92, the electronically closed shell system, behave completely\ndifferently and do not show the favored icosahedral local order. It is the\nabsence of icosahedral local order which is responsible for rather low melting\ntemperatures observed in the experiments.\n", "  The effect of an external force on the kinetics of diffusion-assisted\nescaping of Brownian particles from a potential well is analyzed in detail. The\nanalysis is made within the two-state model of the process which is known to be\nvalid in the deep well limit in the absence of external force. The generalized\nvariant of this model, taking into account the effect of the force, is shown to\nbe quite accurate as well for some shapes of the well. Within the generalized\ntwo-state model simple expressions for the well depopulation kinetics and, in\nparticular, the for the escape rate are obtained. These expressions show that\nthe effect of the force ($F$) manifests itself in the escape rate dependence on\nthe only parameter $\\varphi = Fa/(2k_b T)$, where $a$ is the Onzager radius of\nthe attractive part of the well $U(r)$, defined by the relation $|U(a)| = k_b\nT$. The limiting behavior of this dependence in the cases of weak and strong\nforce is analyzed in detail. Possible applications as well as the relation of\nthe results of the analysis to those obtained earlier are briefly discussed.\n", "  We introduce an accurate and efficient algebraic technique for the\ncomputation of the vibrational spectra of triatomic molecules, of both linear\nand bent equilibrium geometry. The full three-dimensional potential energy\nsurface (PES), which can be based on entirely {\\it ab initio} data, is\nparameterized as a product Morse-cosine expansion, expressed in bond-angle\ninternal coordinates, and includes explicit interactions among the local modes.\nWe describe the stretching degrees of freedom in the framework of a Morse-type\nexpansion on a suitable algebraic basis, which provides exact analytical\nexpressions for the elements of a sparse Hamiltonian matrix. Likewise, we use a\ncosine power expansion on a spherical harmonics basis for the bending degree of\nfreedom. The resulting matrix representation in the product space is very\nsparse and vibrational levels and eigenfunctions can be obtained by efficient\ndiagonalization techniques. We apply this method to carbonyl sulfide OCS,\nhydrogen cyanide HCN, water H$_2$O, and nitrogen dioxide NO$_2$. When we base\nour calculations on high-quality PESs tuned to the experimental data, the\ncomputed spectra are in very good agreement with the observed band origins.\n", "  In this paper, first, we answer affirmatively an open problem which was\npresented in 2005 by professor Gudder on the sub-sequential effect algebras.\nThat is, we prove that if $(E,0,1, \\oplus, \\circ)$ is a sequential effect\nalgebra and $A$ is a commutative subset of $E$, then the sub-sequential effect\nalgebra $\\bar{A}$ generated by $A$ is also commutative. Next, we also study the\nfollowing uniqueness problem: If $na=nb=c$ for some positive integer $n\\geq 2$,\nthen under what conditions $a=b$ hold? We prove that if $c$ is a sharp element\nof $E$ and $a|b$, then $a=b$. We give also two examples to show that neither of\nthe above two conditions can be discarded.\n", "  We report spin polarized density functional calculations of ferromagnetic\nproperties of a series of ZnO clusters and solid containing one or two\nsubstitutional carbon impurities. We analyze the eigen value spectra, spin\ndensities and molecular orbitals, and induced magnetic moments for ZnC,\nZn$_{2}$C, Zn$_{2}$OC, carbon substituted clusters Zn$_{n}$O$_{n}$ (n=3--10,\n12) and ZnO solid. The results show that the doping induces magnetic moment of\nthe $\\sim$2 $\\mu_{B}$ in all the cases. All the systems with two carbon\nimpurities show ferromagnetic interaction except when the carbon atoms share\nthe same Zn atom as the nearest neighbor. This ferromagnetic interaction is\npredominantly mediated via $\\pi$ bonds in ring structures and through $\\pi$ and\n$\\sigma$ bonds in three dimensional structure. The calculations also show that\nthe interaction is significantly enhanced in solid, bringing out the role of\ndimensionality of Zn-O network connecting two carbon atoms.\n", "  A quantum effect is an operator $A$ on a complex Hilbert space $H$ that\nsatisfies $0\\leq A\\leq I$, ${\\cal E} (H)$ is the set of all quantum effects on\n$H$. In 2001, Professor Gudder and Nagy studied the sequential product $A\\circ\nB=A^{{1/2}}BA^{{1/2}}$ of $A, B\\in {\\cal E}(H)$. In 2005, Professor Gudder\nasked: Is $A\\circ B=A^{{1/2}}BA^{{1/2}}$ the only sequential product on ${\\cal\nE} (H)$? Recently, Liu and Wu presented an example to show that the answer is\nnegative. In this paper, firstly, we characterize some algebraic properties of\nthe abstract sequential product on ${\\cal E} (H)$; secondly, we present a\ngeneral method for constructing sequential products on ${\\cal E} (H)$; finally,\nwe study some properties of the sequential products constructed by the method\n", "  Polyfluorenes (PFs) represent a unique class of poly para-phenylene based\nblue-emitting polymers with intriguing structure-property relationships. Slight\nvariations in the choice of functionalizing side chains result in dramatic\ndifferences in the inter- and intra-chain structures in PFs. We present\nphotoluminescence (PL) and Raman scattering studies of bulk samples and thin\nfilms of dioctyl-substituted PF (PF8) under hydrostatic pressure. The bulk\nsample was further thermally annealed at 1.9 GPa. The PL vibronics of the as-is\nsample red-shift at an average rate of 26 meV/GPa. The thermally annealed\nsample is characterized by at least two phase transitions at 1.1 GPa and 4.2\nGPa, each of which has a different pressure coefficient for PL vibronics. The\nHuang-Rhys factor, a measure of the electron-phonon interaction, is found to\nincrease with increasing pressures signaling a higher geometric relaxation of\nthe electronic states. The Raman peaks harden with increasing pressures; the\nintra-ring C-C stretch frequency at 1600 cm$^{-1}$ has a pressure coefficient\nof 7.2 cm$^{-1}$/GPa and exhibits asymmetric line shapes at higher pressures,\ncharacteristic of a strong electron-phonon interaction. The optical properties\nof PF8 under high pressure are further contrasted with those of a branched side\nchain substituted PF.\n", "  In 2006, Gudder introduced a logic order on bounded quantum observable set\n$S(H)$. In 2007, Pulmannova and Vincekova proved that for each subset $\\cal D$\nof $S(H)$, the infimum of $\\cal D$ exists with respect to this logic order. In\nthis paper, we present the spectral representation for the infimum of $\\cal D$.\n", "  This paper verifies a conjecture posed in a pair of papers on the fixed point\nsets for a class of quantum operations. Specifically, it is proved that if a\nquantum operation has mutually commuting operation elements that are effects\nforming a resolution of the identity, then the fixed points set of the quantum\noperation is exactly the commutant of the operation elements.\n", "  Promising pathways for photoassociative formation of ultracold heteronuclear\nalkali metal dimers in their lowest rovibronic levels (denoted X(0,0)) are\nexamined using high quality ab initio calculations of potential energy curves\ncurrently available. A promising pathway for KRb, involving the resonant\ncoupling of the $2 ^1\\Pi$ and $1 ^1\\Pi $ states just below the lowest excited\nasymptote (K($4s$)+Rb($5p_{1/2}$)), is found to occur also for RbCs and less\npromisingly for KCs as well. The resonant coupling of the $3 ^1 \\Sigma ^+ $ and\n$1 ^1\\Pi $ states, also just below the lowest excited asymptote, is found to be\npromising for LiNa, LiK, LiRb, and less promising for LiCs and KCs. Direct\nphotoassociation to the $1 ^1\\Pi $ state near dissociation appears promising in\nthe final dimers, NaK, NaRb, and NaCs, although detuning more than 100\ncm$^{-1}$ below the lowest excited asymptote may be required.\n", "  By employing a newly developed dynamical simulation method, which is a\ncombination of classical molecular dynamics (MD) and the adaptive\ntime-dependent density matrix renormalization group (TDDMRG), we investigate\nthe dynamics of charge carrier transitions in trans-polyacetylene (PA) with the\ninclusion of both electron-phonon and electron -electron interactions. The\ncalculations are performed within a modified Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model\nin which electron-electron interactions are taken into account via the\ncombination with extended Hubbard model (EHM). We find that removing an\nelectron from a trans-PA chain bearing a positively charged polaron leads to\nthe formation of a pair of charged solitons. Furthermore, we study the effect\nof electron-electron interactions on such charge carrier transitions in\ntrans-PA. Our results show that increasing the on-site Coulomb interaction U\nand the nearest-neighbor Coulomb repulsion V will not change the qualitative\nbehavior of the transition from a polaron to a soliton pair in the evolution\nprocess but will quantitatively reduce the moving velocities of the both formed\nsolitons significantly and change the conditions for the soliton collisions.\n", "  We report on gamma-ray observations in the off-pulse window of the Vela\npulsar PSR B0833-45, using 11 months of survey data from the Fermi Large Area\nTelescope (LAT). This pulsar is located in the 8 degree diameter Vela supernova\nremnant, which contains several regions of non-thermal emission detected in the\nradio, X-ray and gamma-ray bands. The gamma-ray emission detected by the LAT\nlies within one of these regions, the 2*3 degrees area south of the pulsar\nknown as Vela-X. The LAT flux is signicantly spatially extended with a best-fit\nradius of 0.88 +/- 0.12 degrees for an assumed radially symmetric uniform disk.\nThe 200 MeV to 20 GeV LAT spectrum of this source is well described by a\npower-law with a spectral index of 2.41 +/- 0.09 +/- 0.15 and integral flux\nabove 100 MeV of (4.73 +/- 0.63 +/- 1.32) * 10^{-7} cm^{-2} s^{-1}. The first\nerrors represent the statistical error on the fit parameters, while the second\nones are the systematic uncertainties. Detailed morphological and spectral\nanalyses give strong constraints on the energetics and magnetic field of the\npulsar wind nebula (PWN) system and favor a scenario with two distinct electron\npopulations.\n", "  We study accommodation of an excess charge carrier on long even-N polyynic\noligomers C_{N}H_{2} due to displacements of the underlying carbon lattice and\npolarization of the surrounding solvent in the context of carrier\nself-localization into a polaronic state. Spatial patterns of bond-length\nalternation, excess charge and spin densities are compared as derived with\nHartree-Fock and two hybrid-DFT methods (BHandHLYP and B3LYP) in conjunction\nwith the polarizable continuum model. Quite distinct resulting pictures of\ncarrier accommodation are found when contributions from different interactions\nare analyzed. Solvation robustly acts to promote excess charge localization.\n", "  Conventionally, the Ih symmetry of fullerene C60 is accepted which is\nsupported by numerous calculations. However, this conclusion results from the\nconsideration of the molecule electron system, of its odd electrons in\nparticular, in a close-shell approximation without taking the electron spin\ninto account. Passing to the open-shell approximation has lead to both the\nenergy and the symmetry lowering up to Ci. Seemingly contradicting to a\nhigh-symmetry pattern of experimental recording, particularly concerning the\nmolecule electronic spectra, the finding is considered in the current paper\nfrom the continuous symmetry viewpoint. Exploiting both continuous symmetry\nmeasure and continuous symmetry content, was shown that formal Ci symmetry of\nthe molecule is by 99.99% Ih. A similar continuous symmetry analysis of the\nfullerene monoderivatives gives a reasonable explanation of a large variety of\ntheir optical spectra patterns within the framework of the same C1 formal\nsymmetry exhibiting a strong stability of the C60 skeleton.\n", "  In recent years it has become widely accepted that a dynamical length scale\n{\\xi}_{\\alpha} plays an important role in supercooled liquids near the glass\ntransition. We examine the implications of the interplay between the growing\n{\\xi}_{\\alpha} and the size of the crystal nucleus, {\\xi}_M, which shrinks on\ncooling. We argue that at low temperatures where {\\xi}_{\\alpha} > {\\xi}_M a new\ncrystallization mechanism emerges enabling rapid development of a large scale\nweb of sparsely connected crystallinity. Though we predict this web percolates\nthe system at too low a temperature to be easily seen in the laboratory, there\nare noticeable residual effects near the glass transition that can account for\nseveral previously observed unexplained phenomena of deeply supercooled liquids\nincluding Fischer clusters, and anomalous crystal growth near T_g.\n", "  We present the results of a computer simulation study of the liquid density\ndistribution normal to the interface between liquid Hg and the reconstructed\n(0001) face of sapphire. The simulations are based on an extension of the\nself-consistent quantum Monte Carlo scheme previously used to study the\nstructure of the liquid metal-vapor interface. The calculated density\ndistribution is in very good agreement with that inferred from the recent\nexperimental data of Tamam et al (J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 1, 1041-1045 (2010)). We\nconclude that, to account for the difference in structure between the liquid\nHg-vapor and liquid-Hg-reconstructed (0001) Al2O3 interfaces, it is not\nnecessary assume there is charge transfer from the Hg to the Al2O3. Rather, the\navailable experimental data are adequately reproduced when the van der Waals\ninteractions of the Al and O atoms with Hg atoms and the exclusion of electron\ndensity from Al2O3 via repulsion of the electrons from the closed shells of the\nions in the solid are accounted for.\n", "  Structure, stability and reactivity of clathrate hydrates with or without\nhydrogen encapsulation are studied using standard density functional\ncalculations. Conceptual density functional theory based reactivity descriptors\nand the associated electronic structure principles are used to explain the\nhydrogen storage properties of clathrate hydrates. Different thermodynamic\nquantities associated with H2-trapping are also computed. The stability of the\nH2-clathrate hydrate complexes increases upon the subsequent addition of\nhydrogen molecules to the clathrate hydrates. The efficacy of trapping of\nhydrogen molecules inside the cages of clathrate hydrates depends upon the\ncavity sizes and shapes of the clathrate hydrates. Computational studies reveal\nthat 512 and 51262 structures are able to accommodate up to two H2 molecules\nwhereas 51268 can accommodate up to six hydrogen molecules.\n", "  A finite-temperature density functional approach to describe the properties\nof parahydrogen in the liquid-vapor coexistence region is presented. The first\nproposed functional is zero-range, where the density-gradient term is adjusted\nso as to reproduce the surface tension of the liquid-vapor interface at low\ntemperature. The second functional is finite-range and, while it is fitted to\nreproduce bulk pH2 properties only, it is shown to yield surface properties in\ngood agreement with experiments. These functionals are used to study the\nsurface thickness of the liquid-vapor interface, the wetting transition of\nparahydrogen on a planar Rb model surface, and homogeneous cavitation in bulk\nliquid pH2.\n", "  We present results of a theoretical study of structural and superfluid\nproperties of parahydrogen clusters comprising 25, 26 and 27 molecules at low\ntemperature. The microscopic model utilized here is based on the\nSilvera-Goldman pair potential. Numerical results are obtained by means of\nQuantum Monte Carlo simulations, making use of the continuous-space Worm\nAlgorithm. The clusters are superfluid in the low temperature limit, but\ndisplay markedly different physical behaviours. For N=25 and 27, superfluidity\nat low temperature arises as clusters melt, i.e., become progressively\nliquid-like as a result of quantum effects. On the other hand, for N = 26 the\ncluster remains rigid and solid-like. We argue that this cluster can be\nregarded as a mesoscopic \"supersolid\". This physical picture is supported by\nresults of simulations in which a single parahydrogen molecule in the cluster\nis isotopically substituted.\n", "  We have determined the ground-state energies of para-H$_2$ clusters at zero\ntemperature using the diffusion Monte Carlo method. The liquid or solid\ncharacter of each cluster is investigated by restricting the phase through the\nuse of proper importance sampling. Our results show inhomogeneous\ncrystallization of clusters, with alternating behavior between liquid and solid\nphases up to N=55. From there on, all clusters are solid. The ground-state\nenergies in the range N=13--75 are established and the stable phase of each\ncluster is determined. In spite of the small differences observed between the\nenergy of liquid and solid clusters, the corresponding density profiles are\nsignificantly different, feature that can help to solve ambiguities in the\ndetermination of the specific phase of H$_2$ clusters.\n", "  The utility of a continuous beam of He droplets for the assembly and surface\ndeposition of Ag clusters, <N(Ag)> ~ 300 - 6 000, is studied with transmission\nelectron microscopy. Images of the clusters on amorphous carbon substrates\nobtained at short deposition times have provided for a measure of the size\ndistribution of the metal clusters. The average sizes of the deposited clusters\nare in good agreement with an energy balance based estimate of Ag cluster\ngrowth in He droplets. Measurements of the deposition rate indicate that upon\nimpact with the surface the He-embedded cluster is attached with high\nprobability. The stability of the deposited clusters on the substrate is\ndiscussed.\n", "  The top eigenvalues of rank $r$ spiked real Wishart matrices and additively\nperturbed Gaussian orthogonal ensembles are known to exhibit a phase transition\nin the large size limit. We show that they have limiting distributions for\nnear-critical perturbations, fully resolving the conjecture of Baik, Ben Arous\nand P\\'{e}ch\\'{e} [Duke Math. J. (2006) 133 205-235]. The starting point is a\nnew $(2r+1)$-diagonal form that is algebraically natural to the problem; for\nboth models it converges to a certain random Schr\\\"{o}dinger operator on the\nhalf-line with $r\\times r$ matrix-valued potential. The perturbation determines\nthe boundary condition and the low-lying eigenvalues describe the limit,\njointly as the perturbation varies in a fixed subspace. We treat the real,\ncomplex and quaternion ($\\beta=1,2,4$) cases simultaneously. We further\ncharacterize the limit laws in terms of a diffusion related to Dyson's Brownian\nmotion, or alternatively a linear parabolic PDE; here $\\beta$ appears simply as\na parameter. At $\\beta=2$, the PDE appears to reconcile with known Painlev\\'{e}\nformulas for these $r$-parameter deformations of the GUE Tracy-Widom law.\n", "  We have studied the photo-induced isomerization from 1,3-cyclohexadiene to\n1,3,5-hexatriene in the presence of an intense ultrafast laser pulse. We find\nthat the laser field maximally suppresses isomerization if it is both polarized\nparallel to the excitation dipole and present 50 fs after the initial\nphotoabsorption, at the time when the system is expected to be in the vicinity\nof a conical intersection that mediates this structural transition. A modified\nab initio multiple spawning (AIMS) method shows that the laser induces a\nresonant coupling between the excited state and the ground state, i.e., a\nlight-induced conical intersection. The theory accounts for the timing and\ndirection of the effect.\n", "  We employ a large scale molecular simulation based on bond-order ReaxFF to\nsimulate the chemical reaction and study the damage to a large fragment of\nDNA-molecule in the solution by ionizing radiation. We illustrate that the\nrandomly distributed clusters of diatomic OH-radicals that are primary products\nof megavoltage ionizing radiation in water-based systems are the main source of\nhydrogen-abstraction as well as formation of carbonyl- and hydroxyl-groups in\nthe sugar-moiety that create holes in the sugar-rings. These holes grow up\nslowly between DNA-bases and DNA-backbone and the damage collectively propagate\nto DNA single and double strand break.\n", "  We employ molecular dynamic simulations to study the reduction process of\ngraphene-oxide (GO) in a chemically active environment enriched with hydrogen.\nWe examine the concentration and pressure of hydrogen gas as a function of\ntemperature in which abstraction of oxygen is possible with minimum damage to\nC-sp$^2$ bonds hence preserving the integrity of the graphene sheet. Through\nthese studies we find chemical pathways that demonstrate beneficiary mechanisms\nfor the quality of graphene including formation of water as well as suppression\nof carbonyl pair holes in favor of hydroxyl and epoxy formation facilitated by\nhydrogen gas in the environment.\n", "  A usual code for quantum wiretap channel requires an auxiliary random\nvariable subject to the perfect uniform distribution. However, it is difficult\nto prepare such an auxiliary random variable. We propose a code that requires\nonly an auxiliary random variable subject to a non-uniform distribution instead\nof the perfect uniform distribution. Further, we evaluate the exponential\ndecreasing rate of leaked information and derive its equivocation rate. For\npractical constructions, we also discuss the security when our code consists of\na linear error correcting code.\n", "  We treat secret key extraction when the eavesdropper has correlated quantum\nstates. We propose quantum privacy amplification theorems different from\nRenner's, which are based on quantum conditional R\\'{e}nyi entropy of order\n1+s. Using those theorems, we derive an exponential decreasing rate for leaked\ninformation and the asymptotic equivocation rate, which have not been derived\nhitherto in the quantum setting.\n", "  Understanding the damage of DNA bases from hydrogen abstraction by free OH\nradicals is of particular importance to reveal the effect of hydroxyl radicals\nproduced by the secondary effect of radiation. Previous studies address the\nproblem with truncated DNA bases as ab-initio quantum simulation required to\nstudy such electronic spin dependent processes are computationally expensive.\nHere, for the first time, we employ a multiscale and hybrid\nQuantum-Mechanical-Molecular-Mechanical simulation to study the interaction of\nOH radicals with guanine-deoxyribose-phosphate DNA molecular unit in the\npresence of water where all the water molecules and the deoxyribose-phosphate\nfragment are treated with the simplistic classical Molecular-Mechanical scheme.\nOur result illustrates that the presence of water strongly alters the\nhydrogen-abstraction reaction as the hydrogen bonding of OH radicals with water\nrestricts the relative orientation of the OH-radicals with respective to the\nthe DNA base (here guanine). This results in an angular anisotropy in the\nchemical pathway and a lower efficiency in the hydrogen abstraction mechanisms\nthan previously anticipated for identical system in vacuum. The method can\neasily be extended to single and double stranded DNA without any appreciable\ncomputational cost as these molecular units can be treated in the classical\nsubsystem as has been demonstrated here.\n", "  This article proposes a unified method to estimation of group action by using\nthe inverse Fourier transform of the input state. The method provides optimal\nestimation for commutative and non-commutative group with/without energy\nconstraint. The proposed method can be applied to projective representations of\nnon-compact groups as well as of compact groups. This paper addresses the\noptimal estimation of R, U(1), SU(2), SO(3), and R^2 with Heisenberg\nrepresentation under a suitable energy constraint.\n", "  Recent studies have claimed the existence of very massive stars (VMS) up to\n300 solar masses in the local Universe. As this finding may represent a\nparadigm shift for the canonical stellar upper-mass limit of 150 Msun, it is\ntimely to discuss the status of the data, as well as the far-reaching\nimplications of such objects. We held a Joint Discussion at the General\nAssembly in Beijing to discuss (i) the determination of the current masses of\nthe most massive stars, (ii) the formation of VMS, (iii) their mass loss, and\n(iv) their evolution and final fate. The prime aim was to reach broad consensus\nbetween observers and theorists on how to identify and quantify the dominant\nphysical processes.\n", "  We report on the observation of discrete structures in the electron energy\ndistribution for strong field double ionization of Argon at 394 nm. The\nexperimental conditions were chosen in order to ensure a non-sequential\nejection of both electrons with an intermediate rescattering step. We have\nfound discrete ATI (above-threshold ionization) like peaks in the sum energy of\nboth electrons, as predicted by all quantum mechanical calculations. More\nsurprisingly however is the observation of two ATI combs in the energy\ndistribution of the individual electrons.\n", "  The influence of water and radicals on SOAs produced by {\\beta}-pinene\nozonolysis was investigated at 298 and 288 K using a laminar flow reactor. A\nvolatility tandem differential mobility analyzer (VTDMA) was used to measure\nthe evaporation of the SOA, enabling the parameterization of its volatility\nproperties. The parameters extracted included the temperature at which 50% of\nthe aerosol had evaporated (TVFR0.5) and the slope factor (SVFR). An increase\nin SVFR indicates a broader distribution of vapor pressures for the aerosol\nconstituents. Reducing the reaction temperature increased SVFR and decreased\nTVFR0.5 under humid conditions but had less effect on TVFR0.5 under dry\nconditions. In general, higher water concentrations gave lower TVFR0.5 values,\nmore negative SVFR values, and a reduction in total SOA production. The radical\nconditions were changed by introducing OH scavengers to generate systems with\nand without OH radicals and with different [HO2]/[RO2] ratios. Presence of a\nscavenger and lower [HO2]/[RO2] ratio reduced SOA production. Observed changes\nin SVFR values could be linked to the more complex chemistry that occurs in the\nabsence of a scavenger, and indicated that additional HO2 chemistry gives\nproducts with a wider range of vapor pressures. Updates to existing ozonolysis\nmechanisms with routes that describe the observed responses to water and\nradical conditions for monoterpenes with endocyclic and exocyclic double bonds\nare discussed.\n", "  Calculating relative free energies is a topic of substantial interest and has\nmany applications including solvation and binding free energies, which are used\nin computational drug discovery. However, there remain the challenges of\naccuracy, simple implementation, robustness and efficiency, which prevent the\ncalculations from being automated and limit their use in computational drug\ndiscovery. Here we present an exact and complete decoupling analysis in which\nthe partition functions of the compared systems decompose into the partition\nfunctions of the common and different subsystems. This decoupling analysis is\napplicable to submolecules with coupled degrees of freedom and to any potential\nfunction, enabling to remove less terms in the transformation. Then we show\nmathematically, in the context of partition function decoupling, that the two\ncompared systems can be simulated separately, eliminating the need to design a\ncomposite system. We demonstrate the decoupling analysis and the separate\ntransformations in an MD calculation of relative free energy for a general\nforce field which is in agreement with experiments. We present a unified soft\ncore technique that will ensure the monotonicity of the numerically integrated\nfunction. Finally, we show that when the systems have rugged energy landscape\nthey can be equilibrated without introducing another sampling dimension. The\nconcepts presented in the article have implications in accuracy, efficiency,\nsimplicity and robustness of free energy calculations.\n", "  In the decoy quantum key distribution, we show that a smaller decoy intensity\ngives a better key generation rate in the asymptotic setting when we employ\nonly one decoy intensity and the vacuum pulse. In particular, the counting rate\nof single photon can be perfectly estimated when the decoy intensity is\ninfinitesimal. The same property holds even when the intensities cannot be\nperfectly identified. Further, we propose a protocol to improve the key\ngeneration rate over the existing protocol under the same decoy intensity.\n", "  The Michaelis-Menten enzymatic reaction is sufficient to perceive many\nsubtleties of network modeling, including the concentration and time scales\nseparations, the formal equivalence between bulk phase and single-molecule\napproaches, or the relationships between single-cycle transient probabilities\nand steady state rates. Seven methods proposed by different authors and\nyielding the same famous Michaelis-Menten equation, are selected here to\nillustrate the kinetic and probabilistic use of rate constants and to review\nbasic techniques for handling them. Finally, the general rate of an ordered\nmultistep reaction, of which the Michaelis-Menten reaction is a particular\ncase, is deduced from a Markovian approach.\n", "  It is shown that a vortex trapped in one of the banks of a planar edge-type\nJosephson junction in a narrow thin-film superconducting strip can change\ndrastically the field dependence of the junction critical current $I_c(H)$.\nWhen the vortex is trapped at certain positions in the strip middle, the\npattern $I_c(H)$ has zero at $H=0$ instead of the traditional maximum of\n'0-type' junctions. The number of these positions is equal to the number of\nvortices trapped at the same location. When the junction-vortex separation\nexceeds approximately $2W$, $I_c(H)$ is no longer sensitive to the vortex\npresence.\n", "  We present a theoretical first-principles method to calculate the free energy\nof a magnetic system in its high-temperature paramagnetic phase, including\nvibrational, electronic, and magnetic contributions. The method for calculating\nfree energies is based on ab-initio molecular dynamics and combines a treatment\nof disordered magnetism using disordered local moments molecular dynamics\n(DLM-MD) with the temperature dependent effective potential (TDEP) method to\nobtain the vibrational contribution to the free energy. We illustrate the\napplicability of the method by obtaining the anharmonic free energy for the\nparamagnetic cubic and the antiferromagnetic orthorhombic phases of chromium\nnitride. The influence of lattice dynamics on the transition between the two\nphases is demonstrated by constructing the temperature-pressure phase diagram.\n", "  In this paper we discuss different recursion relations (BCFW and all-line\nshift) for the form factors of the operators from the $\\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM\nstress-tensor current supermultiplet $T^{AB}$ in momentum twistor space. We\nshow that cancelations of spurious poles and equivalence between different\ntypes of recursion relations can be naturally understood using geometrical\ninterpretation of the form factors as special limit of the volumes of polytopes\nin $\\mathbb{C}\\mathbb{P}^4$ in close analogy with the amplitude case. We also\nshow how different relations for the IR pole coefficients can be easily derived\nusing momentum twistor representation. This opens an intriguing question -\nwhich of powerful on-shell methods and ideas can survive off-shell ?\n", "  We consider asymptotic hypothesis testing (or state discrimination with\nasymmetric treatment of errors) between an arbitrary fixed bipartite pure state\n$\\ket{\\Psi}$ and the completely mixed state under one-way LOCC (local\noperations and classical communications), two-way LOCC, and separable POVMs. As\na result, we derive the Hoeffding bounds under two-way LOCC POVMs and separable\nPOVMs. Further, we derive a Stein's lemma type of optimal error exponents under\none-way LOCC, two-way LOCC, and separable POVMs up to the third order, which\nclarifies the difference between one-way and two-way LOCC POVM. Our study gives\na very rare example in which the optimal performance under the infinite-round\ntwo-way LOCC is also equal to that under separable operations and can be\nattained with two-round communication, but not attained with the one-way LOCC.\n", "  It is shown that the Bell inequalities are closely related to the triangle\ninequalities involving distance functions amongst pairs of random variables\nwith values $\\left\\{ 0,1\\right\\} $. A hidden variables model may be defined as\na mapping between a set of quantum projection operators and a set of random\nvariables. The model is noncontextual if there is a joint probability\ndistribution. The Bell inequalities are necessary conditions for its existence.\nThe inequalities are most relevant when measurements are performed at\nspace-like separation, thus showing a conflict between quantum mechanics and\nlocal realism (Bell's theorem). The relations of the Bell inequalities with\ncontextuality, Kochen-Specker theorem, and quantum entanglement are briefly\ndiscussed.\n", "  In order to infer the impact of the small-scale physics to the large-scale\nproperties of the universe, we use a series of cosmological $N$-body\nsimulations of self-gravitating matter inhomogeneities to measure, for the\nfirst time, the response function of such a system defined as a functional\nderivative of the nonlinear power spectrum with respect to its linear\ncounterpart. Its measured shape and amplitude are found to be in good agreement\nwith perturbation theory predictions except for the coupling from small to\nlarge-scale perturbations. The latter is found to be significantly damped,\nfollowing a Lorentzian form. These results shed light on validity regime of\nperturbation theory calculations giving a useful guideline for regularization\nof small scale effects in analytical modeling. Most importantly our result\nindicates that the statistical properties of the large-scale structure of the\nuniverse are remarkably insensitive to the details of the small-scale physics,\nastrophysical or gravitational, paving the way for the derivation of robust\nestimates of theoretical uncertainties on the determination of cosmological\nparameters from large-scale survey observations.\n", "  We are concerned with a system of coupled Schr\\\"odinger equations $$-\\Delta\nu_i + V_i(x)u_i = \\partial_{u_i}F(x,u)\\hbox{ on }\\mathbb{R}^N,\\,i=1,2,...,K,$$\nwhere $F$ and $V_i$ are periodic in $x$ and $0\\notin \\sigma(-\\Delta+V_i)$ for\n$i=1,2,...,K$, where $\\sigma(-\\Delta+V_i)$ stands for the spectrum of the\nSchr\\\"odinger operator $-\\Delta+V_i$. We impose general assumptions on the\nnonlinearity $F$ with the subcritical growth and we find a ground state\nsolution being a minimizer of the energy functional associated with the system\non a Nehari-Pankov manifold. Our approach is based on a new linking-type result\ninvolving the Nehari-Pankov manifold.\n", "  Many techniques for measuring neutron star radii rely on absolute flux\nmeasurements in the X-rays. As a result, one of the fundamental uncertainties\nin these spectroscopic measurements arises from the absolute flux calibrations\nof the detectors being used. Using the stable X-ray burster, GS 1826-238, and\nits simultaneous observations by Chandra HETG/ACIS-S and RXTE/PCA as well as by\nXMM-Newton EPIC-pn and RXTE/PCA, we quantify the degree of uncertainty in the\nflux calibration by assessing the differences between the measured fluxes\nduring bursts. We find that the RXTE/PCA and the Chandra gratings measurements\nagree with each other within their formal uncertainties, increasing our\nconfidence in these flux measurements. In contrast, XMM-Newton EPIC-pn measures\n14.0$\\pm$0.3 % less flux than the RXTE/PCA. This is consistent with the\npreviously reported discrepancy with the flux measurements of EPIC-pn, compared\nto EPIC-MOS1, MOS2 and ACIS-S detectors. We also show that any intrinsic time\ndependent systematic uncertainty that may exist in the calibration of the\nsatellites has already been implicity taken into account in the neutron star\nradius measurements.\n", "  The Diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) method is applied to the water monomer,\ndimer, and hexamer, using q-TIP4P/F, one of the most simple, empirical water\nmodels with flexible monomers. The bias in the time step ($\\Delta\\tau$) and\npopulation size ($N_w$) is investigated. For the binding energies, the bias in\n$\\Delta\\tau$ cancels nearly completely, while a noticeable bias in $N_w$ still\nremains. However, for the isotope shift, (e.g, in the dimer binding energies\nbetween (H$_2$O)$_2$ and (D$_2$O)$_2$) the systematic errors in $N_w$ do\ncancel. Consequently, very accurate results for the latter (within $\\sim 0.01$\nkcal/mol) are obtained with relatively moderate numerical effort ($N_w\\sim\n10^3$). For the water hexamer and its (D$_2$O)$_6$ isotopomer the DMC results\nas a function of $N_w$ are examined for the cage and prism isomers. For a given\nisomer, the issue of the walker population leaking out of the corresponding\nbasin of attraction is addressed by using appropriate geometric constraints.\nThe population size bias for the hexamer is more severe, and in order to\nmaintain accuracy similar to that of the dimer, the population size $N_w$ must\nbe increased by about two orders of magnitude. Fortunately, when the energy\ndifference between cage and prism is taken, the biases cancel, thereby reducing\nthe systematic errors to within $\\sim 0.01$ kcal/mol when using a population of\n$N_w=4.8\\times 10^5$ walkers. Consequently, a very accurate result for the\nisotope shift is also obtained. Notably, both the quantum and the isotope\neffects for the prism-cage energy difference are small.\n", "  The European Space Agency's Planck satellite, dedicated to studying the early\nUniverse and its subsequent evolution, was launched 14~May 2009 and scanned the\nmicrowave and submillimetre sky continuously between 12~August 2009 and\n23~October 2013. In February~2015, ESA and the Planck Collaboration released\nthe second set of cosmology products based on data from the entire Planck\nmission, including both temperature and polarization, along with a set of\nscientific and technical papers and a web-based explanatory supplement. This\npaper gives an overview of the main characteristics of the data and the data\nproducts in the release, as well as the associated cosmological and\nastrophysical science results and papers. The science products include maps of\nthe cosmic microwave background (CMB), the thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect,\nand diffuse foregrounds in temperature and polarization, catalogues of compact\nGalactic and extragalactic sources (including separate catalogues of\nSunyaev-Zeldovich clusters and Galactic cold clumps), and extensive simulations\nof signals and noise used in assessing the performance of the analysis methods\nand assessment of uncertainties. The likelihood code used to assess\ncosmological models against the Planck data are described, as well as a CMB\nlensing likelihood. Scientific results include cosmological parameters deriving\nfrom CMB power spectra, gravitational lensing, and cluster counts, as well as\nconstraints on inflation, non-Gaussianity, primordial magnetic fields, dark\nenergy, and modified gravity.\n", "  This paper describes the mapmaking procedure applied to Planck LFI (Low\nFrequency Instrument) data. The mapmaking step takes as input the calibrated\ntimelines and pointing information. The main products are sky maps of $I,Q$,\nand $U$ Stokes components. For the first time, we present polarization maps at\nLFI frequencies. The mapmaking algorithm is based on a destriping technique,\nenhanced with a noise prior. The Galactic region is masked to reduce errors\narising from bandpass mismatch and high signal gradients. We apply horn-uniform\nradiometer weights to reduce effects of beam shape mismatch. The algorithm is\nthe same as used for the 2013 release, apart from small changes in parameter\nsettings. We validate the procedure through simulations. Special emphasis is\nput on the control of systematics, which is particularly important for accurate\npolarization analysis. We also produce low-resolution versions of the maps, and\ncorresponding noise covariance matrices. These serve as input in later analysis\nsteps and parameter estimation. The noise covariance matrices are validated\nthrough noise Monte Carlo simulations. The residual noise in the map products\nis characterized through analysis of half-ring maps, noise covariance matrices,\nand simulations.\n", "  Planck has mapped the microwave sky in nine frequency bands between 30 and\n857 GHz in temperature and seven bands between 30 and 353 GHz in polarization.\nIn this paper we consider the problem of diffuse astrophysical component\nseparation, and process these maps within a Bayesian framework to derive a\nconsistent set of full-sky astrophysical component maps. For the temperature\nanalysis, we combine the Planck observations with the 9-year WMAP sky maps and\nthe Haslam et al. 408 MHz map to derive a joint model of CMB, synchrotron,\nfree-free, spinning dust, CO, line emission in the 94 and 100 GHz channels, and\nthermal dust emission. Full-sky maps are provided with angular resolutions\nvarying between 7.5 arcmin and 1 deg. Global parameters (monopoles, dipoles,\nrelative calibration, and bandpass errors) are fitted jointly with the sky\nmodel, and best-fit values are tabulated. For polarization, the model includes\nCMB, synchrotron, and thermal dust emission. These models provide excellent\nfits to the observed data, with rms temperature residuals smaller than 4 uK\nover 93% of the sky for all Planck frequencies up to 353 GHz, and fractional\nerrors smaller than 1% in the remaining 7% of the sky. The main limitations of\nthe temperature model at the lower frequencies are degeneracies among the\nspinning dust, free-free, and synchrotron components; additional observations\nfrom external low-frequency experiments will be essential to break these. The\nmain limitations of the temperature model at the higher frequencies are\nuncertainties in the 545 and 857 GHz calibration and zero-points. For\npolarization, the main outstanding issues are instrumental systematics in the\n100-353 GHz bands on large angular scales in the form of\ntemperature-to-polarization leakage, uncertainties in the analog-to-digital\nconversion, and very long time constant corrections, all of which are expected\nto improve in the near future.\n", "  We study the implications of Planck data for models of dark energy (DE) and\nmodified gravity (MG), beyond the cosmological constant scenario. We start with\ncases where the DE only directly affects the background evolution, considering\nTaylor expansions of the equation of state, principal component analysis and\nparameterizations related to the potential of a minimally coupled DE scalar\nfield. When estimating the density of DE at early times, we significantly\nimprove present constraints. We then move to general parameterizations of the\nDE or MG perturbations that encompass both effective field theories and the\nphenomenology of gravitational potentials in MG models. Lastly, we test a range\nof specific models, such as k-essence, f(R) theories and coupled DE. In\naddition to the latest Planck data, for our main analyses we use baryonic\nacoustic oscillations, type-Ia supernovae and local measurements of the Hubble\nconstant. We further show the impact of measurements of the cosmological\nperturbations, such as redshift-space distortions and weak gravitational\nlensing. These additional probes are important tools for testing MG models and\nfor breaking degeneracies that are still present in the combination of Planck\nand background data sets. All results that include only background\nparameterizations are in agreement with LCDM. When testing models that also\nchange perturbations (even when the background is fixed to LCDM), some tensions\nappear in a few scenarios: the maximum one found is \\sim 2 sigma for Planck\nTT+lowP when parameterizing observables related to the gravitational potentials\nwith a chosen time dependence; the tension increases to at most 3 sigma when\nexternal data sets are included. It however disappears when including CMB\nlensing.\n", "  We compute and investigate four types of imprint of a stochastic background\nof primordial magnetic fields (PMFs) on the cosmic microwave background (CMB)\nanisotropies: the impact of PMFs on the CMB spectra; the effect on CMB\npolarization induced by Faraday rotation; the impact of PMFs on the ionization\nhistory; magnetically-induced non-Gaussianities; and the magnetically-induced\nbreaking of statistical isotropy. Overall, Planck data constrain the amplitude\nof PMFs to less than a few nanogauss. In particular, individual limits coming\nfrom the analysis of the CMB angular power spectra, using the Planck\nlikelihood, are $B_{1\\,\\mathrm{Mpc}}< 4.4$ nG (where $B_{1\\,\\mathrm{Mpc}}$ is\nthe comoving field amplitude at a scale of 1 Mpc) at 95% confidence level,\nassuming zero helicity, and $B_{1\\,\\mathrm{Mpc}}< 5.6$ nG for a maximally\nhelical field.For nearly scale-invariant PMFs we obtain\n$B_{1\\,\\mathrm{Mpc}}<2.0$ nG and $B_{1\\,\\mathrm{Mpc}}<0.9$ nG if the impact of\nPMFs on the ionization history of the Universe is included. From the analysis\nof magnetically-induced non-Gaussianity we obtain three different values,\ncorresponding to three applied methods, all below 5 nG. The constraint from the\nmagnetically-induced passive-tensor bispectrum is $B_{1\\,\\mathrm{Mpc}}< 2.8$\nnG. A search for preferred directions in the magnetically-induced passive\nbispectrum yields $B_{1\\,\\mathrm{Mpc}}< 4.5$ nG, whereas the the\ncompensated-scalar bispectrum gives $B_{1\\,\\mathrm{Mpc}}< 3$ nG. The analysis\nof the Faraday rotation of CMB polarization by PMFs uses the Planck power\nspectra in $EE$ and $BB$ at 70 GHz and gives $B_{1\\,\\mathrm{Mpc}}< 1380$ nG. In\nour final analysis, we consider the harmonic-space correlations produced by\nAlfv\\'en waves, finding no significant evidence for the presence of these\nwaves. Together, these results comprise a comprehensive set of constraints on\npossible PMFs with Planck data.\n", "  We present the all-sky Planck catalogue of Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) sources\ndetected from the 29 month full-mission data. The catalogue (PSZ2) is the\nlargest SZ-selected sample of galaxy clusters yet produced and the deepest\nall-sky catalogue of galaxy clusters. It contains 1653 detections, of which\n1203 are confirmed clusters with identified counterparts in external data-sets,\nand is the first SZ-selected cluster survey containing > $10^3$ confirmed\nclusters. We present a detailed analysis of the survey selection function in\nterms of its completeness and statistical reliability, placing a lower limit of\n83% on the purity. Using simulations, we find that the Y5R500 estimates are\nrobust to pressure-profile variation and beam systematics, but accurate\nconversion to Y500 requires. the use of prior information on the cluster\nextent. We describe the multi-wavelength search for counterparts in ancillary\ndata, which makes use of radio, microwave, infra-red, optical and X-ray\ndata-sets, and which places emphasis on the robustness of the counterpart\nmatch. We discuss the physical properties of the new sample and identify a\npopulation of low-redshift X-ray under- luminous clusters revealed by SZ\nselection. These objects appear in optical and SZ surveys with consistent\nproperties for their mass, but are almost absent from ROSAT X-ray selected\nsamples.\n", "  We present the Planck Catalogue of Galactic Cold Clumps (PGCC), an all-sky\ncatalogue of Galactic cold clump candidates detected by Planck. This catalogue\nis the full version of the Early Cold Core (ECC) catalogue, which was made\navailable in 2011 with the Early Release Compact Source Catalogue (ERCSC) and\ncontained 915 high S/N sources. It is based on the Planck 48 months mission\ndata that are currently being released to the astronomical community. The PGCC\ncatalogue is an observational catalogue consisting exclusively of Galactic cold\nsources. The three highest Planck bands (857, 545, 353 GHz) have been combined\nwith IRAS data at 3 THz to perform a multi-frequency detection of sources\ncolder than their local environment. After rejection of possible extragalactic\ncontaminants, the PGCC catalogue contains 13188 Galactic sources spread across\nthe whole sky, i.e., from the Galactic plane to high latitudes, following the\nspatial distribution of the main molecular cloud complexes. The median\ntemperature of PGCC sources lies between 13 and 14.5 K, depending on the\nquality of the flux density measurements, with a temperature ranging from 5.8\nto 20 K after removing sources with the 1% largest temperature estimates. Using\nseven independent methods, reliable distance estimates have been obtained for\n5574 sources, which allows us to derive their physical properties such as their\nmass, physical size, mean density and luminosity. The PGCC sources are located\nmainly in the solar neighbourhood, up to a distance of 10.5 kpc towards the\nGalactic centre, and range from low-mass cores to large molecular clouds.\nBecause of this diversity and because the PGCC catalogue contains sources in\nvery different environments, the catalogue is useful to investigate the\nevolution from molecular clouds to cores. Finally, the catalogue also includes\n54 additional sources located in the SMC and LMC.\n", "  We present foreground-reduced CMB maps derived from the full Planck data set\nin both temperature and polarization. Compared to the corresponding Planck 2013\ntemperature sky maps, the total data volume is larger by a factor of 3.2 for\nfrequencies between 30 and 70 GHz, and by 1.9 for frequencies between 100 and\n857 GHz. In addition, systematic errors in the forms of\ntemperature-to-polarization leakage, analogue-to-digital conversion\nuncertainties, and very long time constant errors have been dramatically\nreduced, to the extent that the cosmological polarization signal may now be\nrobustly recovered on angular scales $\\ell\\gtrsim40$. On the very largest\nscales, instrumental systematic residuals are still non-negligible compared to\nthe expected cosmological signal, and modes with $\\ell < 20$ are accordingly\nsuppressed in the current polarization maps by high-pass filtering. As in 2013,\nfour different CMB component separation algorithms are applied to these\nobservations, providing a measure of stability with respect to algorithmic and\nmodelling choices. The resulting polarization maps have rms instrumental noise\nranging between 0.21 and 0.27$\\,\\mu\\textrm{K}$ averaged over 55 arcmin pixels,\nand between 4.5 and 6.1$\\,\\mu\\textrm{K}$ averaged over 3.4 arcmin pixels. The\ncosmological parameters derived from the analysis of temperature power spectra\nare in agreement at the $1\\sigma$ level with the Planck 2015 likelihood.\nUnresolved mismatches between the noise properties of the data and simulations\nprevent a satisfactory description of the higher-order statistical properties\nof the polarization maps. Thus, the primary applications of these polarization\nmaps are those that do not require massive simulations for accurate estimation\nof uncertainties, for instance estimation of cross-spectra and\ncross-correlations, or stacking analyses.\n", "  Motivated by recently discovered relations between logarithmically correlated\nGaussian processes and characteristic polynomials of large random $N \\times N$\nmatrices $H$ from the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (GUE), we consider the problem\nof characterising the distribution of the global maximum of\n$D_{N}(x):=-\\log|\\det(xI-H)|$ as $N \\to \\infty$ and $x\\in (-1,1)$. We arrive at\nan explicit expression for the asymptotic probability density of the\n(appropriately shifted) maximum by combining the rigorous Fisher-Hartwig\nasymptotics due to Krasovsky \\cite{K07} with the heuristic {\\it freezing\ntransition} scenario for logarithmically correlated processes. Although the\ngeneral idea behind the method is the same as for the earlier considered case\nof the Circular Unitary Ensemble, the present GUE case poses new challenges. In\nparticular we show how the conjectured {\\it self-duality} in the freezing\nscenario plays the crucial role in our selection of the form of the maximum\ndistribution. Finally, we demonstrate a good agreement of the found probability\ndensity with the results of direct numerical simulations of the maxima of\n$D_{N}(x)$.\n", "  In recent years, many variants of percolation have been used to study network\nstructure and the behavior of processes spreading on networks. These include\nbond percolation, site percolation, $k$-core percolation, bootstrap\npercolation, the generalized epidemic process, and the Watts Threshold Model\n(WTM). We show that --- except for bond percolation --- each of these processes\narises as a special case of the WTM and bond percolation arises from a small\nmodification. In fact \"heterogeneous $k$-core percolation\", a corresponding\n\"heterogeneous bootstrap percolation\" model, and the generalized epidemic\nprocess are completely equivalent to one another and the WTM. We further show\nthat a natural generalization of the WTM in which individuals \"transmit\" or\n\"send a message\" to their neighbors with some probability less than $1$ can be\nreformulated in terms of the WTM, and so this apparent generalization is in\nfact not more general. Finally, we show that in bond percolation, finding the\nset of nodes in the component containing a given node is equivalent to finding\nthe set of nodes activated if that node is initially activated and the node\nthresholds are chosen from the appropriate distribution. A consequence of these\nresults is that mathematical techniques developed for the WTM apply to these\nother models as well, and techniques that were developed for some particular\ncase may in fact apply much more generally.\n", "  Purpose: Respiratory gated radiation therapy (RGRT) is used to minimize the\nradiation dose to normal tissue in lung cancer patients. Determinations of the\ngating window in the respiratory phase of patients are important in RGRT but it\nis not easy. The objective of this study was to determine the optimal gating\nwindow with a visible guiding system in RGRT.\n  Materials and Methods: Between April and October in 2014 the breathing\nsignals of 23 lung cancer patients were recorded with a Real-time Position\nManagement (RPM) respiratory gating system (Varian, USA). We performed\nstatistical analysis with breathing signals to find the optimal gating window\nfor the guided breathing for RGRT.\n  Results: 19 of the 23 patients showed statistically significant differences\n(p < 0.05) when the breathing signals obtained before and after breathing\ntraining were compared, The standard deviation of the respiration signals after\nbreathing training was the lowest in the phase of 30 % - 70 % (p < 0.05).\n  Conclusions: RGRT with RPM system was confirmed the usefulness of the visible\nguiding system. Respiratory regularity was significantly improved with the use\nof the RPM with our visible guidance system, therefore, it would help improve\nthe accuracy and efficiency of RGRT.\n", "  The expansion of a harmonic potential that holds a quantum particle may be\nrealized without any final particle excitation but much faster than\nadiabatically via \"shortcuts to adiabaticity\" (STA). While ideally the process\ntime can be reduced to zero, practical limitations and constraints impose\nminimal finite times for the externally controlled time-dependent frequency\nprotocols. We examine the role of different time-averaged energies (total,\nkinetic, potential, non-adiabatic) and of the instantaneous power in\ncharacterizing or selecting different protocols.Specifically, we prove a virial\ntheorem for STA processes, set minimal energies for specific times or\nviceversa, and discuss their realizability by means of Dirac impulses or\notherwise.\n", "  The objective of this paper is to present a modern and concise new derivation\nfor the explicit expression of the interior and exterior Newtonian potential\ngenerated by homogeneous ellipsoidal domains in $\\mathbb{R}^N$ (with $N\n\\geqslant 3$). The very short argument is essentially based on the application\nof Reynolds transport theorem in connection with Green-Stokes integral\nrepresentation formula for smooth functions on bounded domains of\n$\\mathbb{R}^N$, which permits to reduce the N-dimensional problem to a\n1-dimensional one. Due to its physical relevance, a separate section is devoted\nto the the derivation of the demagnetizing factors of the general ellipsoid\nwhich are one of the most fundamental quantities in ferromagnetism.\n", "  In this article we consider the Standard Model extended by a number of\n(light) right-handed neutrinos, and assume the presence of some heavy physics\nthat cannot be directly produced, but can be probed by its low-energy effective\ninteractions. Within this scenario, we obtain all the gauge-invariant\ndimension-seven effective operators, and determine whether each of the\noperators can be generated at tree-level by the heavy physics, or whether it is\nnecessarily loop generated. We then use the tree-generated operators, including\nthose containing right-handed neutrinos, to put limits on the scale of new\nphysics $ \\Lambda $ using low-energy measurements. We also study the production\nof same-sign dileptons at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and determine the\nconstraints on the heavy physics that can be derived form existing data, as\nwell as the reach in probing $ \\Lambda $ expected from future runs of this\ncollider.\n", "  The physics of strong-field applications requires driver laser pulses that\nare both energetic and extremely short. Whereas optical amplifiers, laser and\nparametric, boost the energy, their gain bandwidth restricts the attainable\npulse duration, requiring additional nonlinear spectral broadening to enable\nfew or even single cycle compression and a corresponding peak power increase.\nIn the mid-IR wavelength range that is critically important for scaling the\nponderomotive energy in strong-field interactions, we demonstrate a remarkably\nsimple energy-efficient and scalable soliton-like pulse compression in a\nmm-long YAG crystal with no additional dispersion management. Sub-three-cycle\npulses with >0.65 TW peak power are compressed and extracted before the onset\nof modulation instability and multiple filamentation as a result of a favorable\ninterplay between strong anomalous dispersion and optical nonlinearity around\nthe wavelength of 3900 nm. As a striking manifestation of the increased peak\npower, we show the evidence of mid-infrared pulse filamentation in atmospheric\nair.\n", "  Many real networks that are inferred or collected from data are incomplete\ndue to missing edges. Missing edges can be inherent to the dataset (Facebook\nfriend links will never be complete) or the result of sampling (one may only\nhave access to a portion of the data). The consequence is that downstream\nanalyses that consume the network will often yield less accurate results than\nif the edges were complete. Community detection algorithms, in particular,\noften suffer when critical intra-community edges are missing. We propose a\nnovel consensus clustering algorithm to enhance community detection on\nincomplete networks. Our framework utilizes existing community detection\nalgorithms that process networks imputed by our link prediction based\nalgorithm. The framework then merges their multiple outputs into a final\nconsensus output. On average our method boosts performance of existing\nalgorithms by 7% on artificial data and 17% on ego networks collected from\nFacebook.\n", "  Following a suggestion that a directed relativistic explosion may have a\nuniversal intermediate asymptotic, we derive a self-similar solution for an\nultra-relativistic jetted blast wave. The solution involves three distinct\nregions: an approximately paraboloid head where the Lorentz factor $\\gamma$\nexceeds $\\sim1/2$ of its maximal, nose value; a geometrically self-similar,\nexpanding envelope slightly narrower than a paraboloid; and an axial core in\nwhich the (cylindrically, henceforth) radial flow $u$ converges inward towards\nthe axis. Most ($\\sim 80\\%$) of the energy lies well beyond the leading, head\nregion. Here, a radial cross section shows a maximal $\\gamma$ (separating the\ncore and the envelope), a sign reversal in $u$, and a minimal $\\gamma$, at\nrespectively $\\sim 1/6$, $\\sim1/4$, and $\\sim3/4$ of the shock radius. The\nsolution is apparently unique, and approximately agrees with previous\nsimulations, of different initial conditions, that resolved the head. This\nsuggests that unlike a spherical relativistic blast wave, our solution is an\nattractor, and may thus describe directed blast waves such as in the external\nshock phase of a $\\gamma$-ray burst.\n", "  Stability is a desirable property of complex ecosystems. If a community of\ninteracting species is at a stable equilibrium point then it is able to\nwithstand small perturbations to component species' abundances without\nsuffering adverse effects. In ecology, the Jacobian matrix evaluated at an\nequilibrium point is known as the community matrix, which describes the\npopulation dynamics of interacting species. A system's asymptotic short- and\nlong-term behaviour can be determined from eigenvalues derived from the\ncommunity matrix. Here we use results from the theory of pseudospectra to\ndescribe intermediate, transient dynamics. We first recover the established\nresult that the transition from stable to unstable dynamics includes a region\nof `transient instability', where the effect of a small perturbation to\nspecies' abundances---to the population vector---is amplified before ultimately\ndecaying. Then we show that the shift from stability to transient instability\ncan be affected by uncertainty in, or small changes to, entries in the\ncommunity matrix, and determine lower and upper bounds to the maximum amplitude\nof perturbations to the population vector. Of five different types of community\nmatrix, we find that amplification is least severe when predator-prey\ninteractions dominate. This analysis is relevant to other systems whose\ndynamics can be expressed in terms of the Jacobian matrix. Our results will\nlead to improved understanding of how multiple perturbations to a complex\nsystem may irrecoverably break stability.\n", "  The experimental evidence for the Hall-Petch dependence of strength on the\ninverse square-root of grain size is reviewed critically. Both the classic data\nand more recent results are considered. While the data can be fitted to the\ninverse square-root dependence excellently (but using two free fitting\nparameters for each dataset), it is also consistent with a dependence on the\nsimple inverse of grain size (with one free fitting parameter for each\ndataset). There have been difficulties, recognised for half-a-century, in\nexplaining the inverse square-root expression. A Bayesian analysis shows that\nthe data strongly supports the simple inverse expression proposed. Since this\nexpression derives from underlying theory, it is also more readily explicable.\nIt is concluded that the Hall-Petch effect is not to be explained by the\nvariety of theories found in the literature, but is a manifestation of, or\nunderlain by, the general size effect observed throughout micromechanics, due\nto the inverse relationship between the stress required and the space available\nfor dislocation sources to operate.\n", "  The Second Planck Catalogue of Compact Sources is a catalogue of sources\ndetected in single-frequency maps from the full duration of the Planck mission\nand supersedes previous versions of the Planck compact source catalogues. It\nconsists of compact sources, both Galactic and extragalactic, detected over the\nentire sky. Compact sources detected in the lower frequency channels are\nassigned to the PCCS2, while at higher frequencies they are assigned to one of\ntwo sub-catalogues, the PCCS2 or PCCS2E, depending on their location on the\nsky. The first of these catalogues covers most of the sky and allows the user\nto produce subsamples at higher reliabilities than the target 80% integral\nreliability of the catalogue. The PCCS2E contains sources detected in sky\nregions where the diffuse emission makes it difficult to quantify the\nreliability of the detections. Both the PCCS2 and PCCS2E include polarization\nmeasurements, in the form of polarized flux densities, or upper limits, and\norientation angles for all seven polarization-sensitive Planck channels. The\nimproved data-processing of the full-mission maps and their reduced noise\nlevels allow us to increase the number of objects in the catalogue, improving\nits completeness for the target 80 % reliability as compared with the previous\nversions, the PCCS and ERCSC catalogues.\n", "  Unitary quantum theory, having no Born Rule, is non-probabilistic. Hence the\nnotorious problem of reconciling it with the unpredictability and appearance of\nstochasticity in quantum measurements. Generalising and improving upon the\nso-called 'decision-theoretic approach' (Deutsch, 1999; Wallace, 2003, 2007,\n2012), I shall recast that problem in the recently proposed constructor theory\nof information - where quantum theory is represented as one of a class of\nsuperinformation theories, which are local, non-probabilistic theories\nconforming to certain constructor-theoretic conditions. I prove that the\nunpredictability of measurement outcomes (to which I give an exact meaning via\nconstructor theory), necessarily arises in superinformation theories. Then I\nexplain how the appearance of stochasticity in (finitely many) repeated\nmeasurements can arise under superinformation theories. And I establish\nsufficient conditions for a superinformation theory to inform decisions (made\nunder it) as if it were probabilistic, via a Deutsch-Wallace-type argument -\nthus defining a class of decision-supporting superinformation theories. This\nbroadens the domain of applicability of that argument to cover\nconstructor-theory compliant theories. In addition, in this version some of the\nargument's assumptions, previously construed as merely decision-theoretic,\nfollow from physical properties expressed by constructor-theoretic principles.\n", "  We apply the recently developed adaptive non-harmonic model based on the\nwave-shape function, as well as the time-frequency analysis tool called\nsynchrosqueezing transform (SST) to model and analyze oscillatory physiological\nsignals. To demonstrate how the model and algorithm work, we apply them to\nstudy the pulse wave signal. By extracting features called the spectral pulse\nsignature, {and} based on functional regression, we characterize the\nhemodynamics from the radial pulse wave signals recorded by the\nsphygmomanometer. Analysis results suggest the potential of the proposed signal\nprocessing approach to extract health-related hemodynamics features.\n", "  Oscillatory flows are commonly experienced by swimming microorganisms in the\nenvironment, industrial applications and rheological investigations. We\nexperimentally characterise the response of the alga {\\it Dunaliella salina} to\noscillatory shear flows, and report the surprising discovery that algal\nswimming trajectories orient perpendicular to the flow-shear plane. The\nordering has the characteristics of a resonance in the driving parameter space.\nThe behaviour is qualitatively reproduced by a simple model and simulations\naccounting for helical swimming, providing the mechanism for ordering and\ncriteria for the resonant amplitude and frequency. The implications of this\nwork for active oscillatory rheology and industrial algal processing are\ndiscussed.\n", "  Stars are not smooth. Their photosphere is covered by a granulation pattern\nassociated with the heat transport by convection. The convection-related\nsurface structures have different size, depth, and temporal variations with\nrespect to the stellar type. The related activity (in addition to other\nphenomena such as magnetic spots, rotation, dust, etc.) potentially causes bias\nin stellar parameters determination, radial velocity, chemical abundances\ndeterminations, and exoplanet transit detections.\n  The role of long-baseline interferometric observations in this astrophysical\ncontext is crucial to characterize the stellar surface dynamics and correct the\npotential biases. In this Chapter, we present how the granulation pattern is\nexpected for different kind of stellar types ranging from main sequence to\nextremely evolved stars of different masses and how interferometric techniques\nhelp to study their photospheric dynamics.\n", "  One of the fundamental principles of statistical physics is that only partial\ninformation about a system's state is required for its macroscopic description.\nThis is not only true for thermal ensembles, but also for the unconventional\nensemble, known as Generalized Gibbs Ensemble (GGE), that is expected to\ndescribe the relaxation of integrable systems after a quantum quench. By\nanalytically studying the quench dynamics in a prototypical one-dimensional\ncritical model, the massless free bosonic field theory, we find evidence of a\nnovel type of equilibration characterized by the preservation of an enormous\namount of memory of the initial state that is accessible by local measurements.\nIn particular, we show that the equilibration retains memory of non-Gaussian\ninitial correlations, in contrast to the case of massive free evolution which\nerases all such memory. The GGE in its standard form, being a Gaussian\nensemble, fails to predict correctly the equilibrium values of local\nobservables, unless the initial state is Gaussian itself. Our findings show\nthat the equilibration of a broad class of quenches whose evolution is\ndescribed by Luttinger liquid theory with an initial state that is non-Gaussian\nin terms of the bosonic field, is not correctly captured by the corresponding\nbosonic GGE, raising doubts about the validity of the latter in general\none-dimensional gapless integrable systems such as the Lieb-Liniger model. We\nalso propose that the same experiment by which the GGE was recently observed\n[Langen et al., Science 348 (2015) 207-211] can also be used to observe its\nfailure, simply by starting from a non-Gaussian initial state.\n", "  We present the current accounting of systematic effect uncertainties for the\nLow Frequency Instrument (LFI) that are relevant to the 2015 release of the\nPlanck cosmological results, showing the robustness and consistency of our data\nset, especially for polarization analysis. We use two complementary approaches:\n(i) simulations based on measured data and physical models of the known\nsystematic effects; and (ii) analysis of difference maps containing the same\nsky signal (\"null-maps\"). The LFI temperature data are limited by instrumental\nnoise. At large angular scales the systematic effects are below the cosmic\nmicrowave background (CMB) temperature power spectrum by several orders of\nmagnitude. In polarization the systematic uncertainties are dominated by\ncalibration uncertainties and compete with the CMB $E$-modes in the multipole\nrange 10--20. Based on our model of all known systematic effects, we show that\nthese effects introduce a slight bias of around $0.2\\,\\sigma$ on the\nreionization optical depth derived from the 70\\,GHz $EE$ spectrum using the 30\nand 353\\,GHz channels as foreground templates. At 30\\,GHz the systematic\neffects are smaller than the Galactic foreground at all scales in temperature\nand polarization, which allows us to consider this channel as a reliable\ntemplate of synchrotron emission. We assess the residual uncertainties due to\nLFI effects on CMB maps and power spectra after component separation and show\nthat these effects are smaller than the CMB amplitude at all scales. We also\nassess the impact on non-Gaussianity studies and find it to be negligible. Some\nresiduals still appear in null maps from particular sky survey pairs,\nparticularly at 30 GHz, suggesting possible straylight contamination due to an\nimperfect knowledge of the beam far sidelobes.\n", "  Motivated by recent experiments on two-component systems, we investigate the\nground-state phase diagram of a mixture of two bosonic species by means of\npath-integral quantum Monte Carlo by the two-worm algorithm. The mixture is\ntrapped in a square lattice at half-filling conditions. Various quantum phases\nare stabilized depending on the interplay between intra- and inter-species\ninteractions. We show that the phase diagram features a demixed superfluid\nphase and demixed Mott-Insulator phase when the inter-species interaction\nbecomes greater than the intra-species repulsion, and a double-superfluid phase\nor a supercounterflow otherwise. We also show that demixing, characterized by\nspatial separation of the two species, can be detected experimentally through\nthe effects of anisotropy revealed by time-of-flight images.\n", "  Complex eigenvalues, resonances, play an important role in large variety of\nfields in physics and chemistry. For example, in cold molecular collision\nexperiments and electron scattering experiments, autoionizing and\npre-dissociative metastable resonances are generated. However, the computation\nof complex resonance eigenvalues is difficult, since it requires severe\nmodifications of standard electronic structure codes and methods. Here we show\nhow resonance eigenvalues, positions and widths, can be calculated using the\nstandard, widely used, electronic-structure packages. Our method enables the\ncalculations of the complex resonance eigenvalues by using analytical\ncontinuation procedures (such as Pad\\'{e}). The key point in our approach is\nthe existence of narrow analytical passages from the real axis to the complex\nenergy plane. In fact, the existence of these analytical passages relies on\nusing finite basis sets. These passages become narrower as the basis set\nbecomes more complete, whereas in the exact limit, these passages to the\ncomplex plane are closed.\n  As illustrative numerical examples we calculated the autoionization\nresonances of helium, hydrogen anion and hydrogen molecule. We show that our\nresults are in an excellent agreement with the results obtained by other\ntheoretical methods and with available experimental results.\n", "  The rich variety of iron-based superconductors and their complex electronic\nstructure lead to a wide range of possibilities for gap symmetry and pairing\ncomponents. Here we solve in the 2-Fe Brillouin zone the full\nfrequency-dependent linearized Eliashberg equations for LiFeAs with\nspin-fluctuation mediated pairing interactions. The magnetic excitations are\ncalculated with the random phase approximation on a correlated electronic\nstructure obtained with density functional theory and dynamical mean field\ntheory. Correlations induce long-lived local moments with orbital-dependent\ndynamics. The interaction between electrons through Hund's coupling promotes\ninter-orbital magnetic susceptibility. As a consequence, the leading pairing\nchannel, conventional $s^{+-}$, acquires sizeable inter-orbital\n$d_{xy}-d_{xz(yz)}$ singlet pairing with odd parity under glide-plane symmetry.\nThese components reduce the superconducting gap magnitude induced by the\nintra-orbital components of the gap function at the electron pockets\nintersection where the Fe-d $t_{2g}$ orbitals strongly mix. This in turn makes\nthe results consistent with available experiments on the angular dependence of\nthe gaps observed on the different Fermi surfaces.\n", "  A topic of intense current investigation pursues the question how the highly\ncrowded environment of biological cells affects the dynamic properties of\npassively diffusing particles. Motivated by recent experiments we report\nresults of extensive simulations of the motion of a finite sized tracer\nparticle in a heterogeneously crowded environment. For given spatial\ndistributions of monodisperse crowders we demonstrate how anomalous diffusion\nwith strongly non-Gaussian features arises in this model system. We investigate\nboth biologically relevant situations of particles released either at the\nsurface of an inner domain (nucleus), or at the outer boundary (cell membrane),\nexhibiting distinctly different behaviour of the observed anomalous diffusion\nfor heterogeneous crowder distributions. Specifically we reveal an extremely\nasymmetric spreading of the tracer even at moderate crowding fractions. In\naddition to the standard mean squared displacement and the local diffusion\nexponent of the tracer particles we investigate the magnitude and the amplitude\nscatter of the time averaged mean squared displacement of individual\ntrajectories, the non-Gaussianity parameter, and the van Hove correlation\nfunction of the particle displacements. We also quantify how the average tracer\ndiffusivity varies with the position in the domain with heterogeneous radial\ndistribution of the crowders and examine the behaviour of the survival\nprobability and the dynamics of first passage events of the tracer. Finally, we\ndiscuss the relevance of our results to single particle tracking measurements\nin biological cells.\n", "  We examine the conditions for the revival of the stalled accretion shock in\ncore-collapse supernovae, in the context of the neutrino heating mechanism. We\ncombine one dimensional simulations of the shock revival process with a\nderivation of a quasi-stationary approximation, which is both accurate and\nefficient in predicting the flow. In particular, this approach is used to\nexplore how the evolution of the system depends on the shock radius, $R_S$, and\nvelocity, $V_S$ (in addition to other global properties of the system). We do\nso through a phase space analysis of the shock acceleration, $a_S$, in the\n$R_S-V_S$ plane, shown to provide quantitative insights into the initiation of\nrunaway expansion and its nature. In the particular case of an initially\nstationary ($V_S=0,\\;a_S=0$) profile, the prospects for an explosion can be\nreasonably assessed by the initial signs of the partial derivatives of the\nshock acceleration, in analogy to a linear damped/anti-damped oscillator. If\n$\\partial a_S/\\partial R_S<0$ and $\\partial a_S/\\partial V_S>0$, runaway\nexpansion will likely occur after several oscillations, while if $\\partial\na_S/\\partial R_S>0$, runaway expansion will commence in a non-oscillatory\nfashion. These two modes of runaway correspond to low and high mass accretion\nrates, respectively. We also use the quasi-stationary approximation to assess\nthe advection-to-heating timescale ratio in the gain region, often used as an\nexplosion proxy. Indeed, this ratio does tend to $\\sim1$ in conjunction with\nrunaway conditions, but neither this unit value nor the specific choice of the\ngain region as a point of reference appear to be distinct conditions in this\nregard.\n", "  Dzhafarov, Zhang, and Kujala (Phil. Trans. Roy. Soc. A 374, 20150099)\nreviewed several behavioral data sets imitating the formal design of the\nquantum-mechanical contextuality experiments. The conclusion was that none of\nthese data sets exhibited contextuality if understood in the generalized sense\nproposed in Dzhafarov, Kujala, and Larsson (Found. Phys. 7, 762-782, 2015),\nwhile the traditional definition of contextuality does not apply to these data\nbecause they violate the condition of consistent connectedness (also known as\nmarginal selectivity, no-signaling condition, no-disturbance principle, etc.).\nIn this paper we clarify the relationship between (in)consistent connectedness\nand (non)contextuality, as well as between the traditional and extended\ndefinitions of (non)contextuality, using as an example the\nClauser-Horn-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequalities originally designed for detecting\ncontextuality in entangled particles.\n", "  Elpasolite is the predominant quaternary crystal structure (AlNaK$_2$F$_6$\nprototype) reported in the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database. We have\ndeveloped a machine learning model to calculate density functional theory\nquality formation energies of all $\\sim$2 M pristine ABC$_2$D$_6$ elpasolite\ncrystals which can be made up from main-group elements (up to bismuth). Our\nmodel's accuracy can be improved systematically, reaching 0.1 eV/atom for a\ntraining set consisting of 10 k crystals. Important bonding trends are\nrevealed, fluoride is best suited to fit the coordination of the D site which\nlowers the formation energy whereas the opposite is found for carbon. The\nbonding contribution of elements A and B is very small on average. Low\nformation energies result from A and B being late elements from group (II), C\nbeing a late (I) element, and D being fluoride. Out of 2 M crystals, 90 unique\nstructures are predicted to be on the convex hull---among which NFAl$_2$Ca$_6$,\nwith peculiar stoichiometry and a negative atomic oxidation state for Al.\n", "  We have performed very large and high resolution cosmological hydrodynamic\nsimulations in order to investigate detectability of nebular lines in the\nrest-frame ultraviolet (UV) to optical wavelength range from galaxies at $z >\n7$. We find that the expected line fluxes are very well correlated with\napparent UV magnitudes. The C IV $1549 \\rm \\AA$ and the C III] $1909 \\rm \\AA$\nlines of galaxies brighter than $26~ \\rm AB$ are detectable with current\nfacilities such as the VLT/XShooter and the Keck/MOSFIRE. Metal lines such as C\nIV $1549 \\rm \\AA$, C III] $1909 \\rm \\AA$, [O II] $3727 \\rm \\AA$ and [O III]\n$4959/5007 \\rm \\AA$ can be good targets for the spectroscopic observation with\nThirty Meter Telescope (TMT), European Extremely Large Telescope (E-ELT), Giant\nMagellan Telescope (GMT) and James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). H$\\alpha$ and\nH$\\beta$ lines are also expected to be detectable with these telescopes. We\nalso predict detectability of the nebular lines for $z > 10$ galaxies that will\nbe found with JWST, Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) and First\nLight And Reionization Explorer (FLARE) $(11 \\leq z \\leq 15$). We conclude that\nthe C IV $1549 \\rm \\AA$, C III] $1909 \\rm \\AA$, [O III] $4959/5007 \\rm \\AA$ and\nH$\\beta$ lines even from $z \\sim 15$ galaxies can be strong targets for TMT,\nELT and JWST. We also find that the magnification by gravitational lensing is\nof great help to detect such high-$z$ galaxies. According to our model, the C\nIII] $1909 \\rm \\AA$ line in $z > 9$ galaxy candidates is detectable even using\nthe current facilities.\n", "  We consider a central system which is coupled via dephasing to an open\nsystem, i.e. an intermediate system which in turn is coupled to another\nenvironment. Considering intermediate and far environment as one composite\nsystem, the coherences in the central system are given in the form of fidelity\namplitudes for a certain perturbed echo dynamics in the composite environment.\nOn the basis of the Born-Markov approximation, we derive a master equation for\nthe reduction of that dynamics to the intermediate system alone. In distinction\nto an earlier paper [arXiv: 1502.04143 (2015)] where we discussed the\nstabilizing effect of the far environment on the decoherence in the central\nsystem, we focus here on the possibility to use the measurable coherences in\nthe central system for probing the open quantum dynamics in the intermediate\nsystem. We illustrate our results for the case of chaotic dynamics in the near\nenvironment, where we compare random matrix simulations with our analytical\nresult.\n", "  [abridged] We present an anisotropic analysis of the baryonic acoustic\noscillation (BAO) scale in the twelfth and final data release of the Baryonic\nOscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS). We independently analyse the LOWZ and\nCMASS galaxy samples: the LOWZ sample contains contains 361 762 galaxies with\nan effective redshift of $z_{\\rm LOWZ}=0.32$; the CMASS sample consists of 777\n202 galaxies with an effective redshift of $z_{\\rm CMASS}=0.57$. We extract the\nBAO peak position from the monopole power spectrum moment, $\\alpha_0$, and from\nthe $\\mu^2$ moment, $\\alpha_2$, where $\\mu$ is the cosine of the angle to the\nline-of-sight. The $\\mu^2$-moment provides equivalent information to that\navailable in the quadrupole but is simpler to analyse. After applying a\nreconstruction algorithm to reduce the BAO suppression by bulk motions, we\nmeasure the BAO peak position in the monopole and $\\mu^2$-moment, which are\nrelated to radial and angular shifts in scale. We report $H(z_{\\rm\nLOWZ})r_s(z_d)=(11.60\\pm0.60)\\cdot10^3 {\\rm km}s^{-1}$ and $D_A(z_{\\rm\nLOWZ})/r_s(z_d)=6.66\\pm0.16$ with a cross-correlation coefficient of\n$r_{HD_A}=0.41$, for the LOWZ sample; and $H(z_{\\rm\nCMASS})r_s(z_d)=(14.56\\pm0.37)\\cdot10^3 {\\rm km}s^{-1}$ and $D_A(z_{\\rm\nCMASS})/r_s(z_d)=9.42\\pm0.13$ with a cross-correlation coefficient of\n$r_{HD_A}=0.47$, for the CMASS sample. We combine these results with the\nmeasurements of the BAO peak position in the monopole and quadrupole\ncorrelation function of the same dataset \\citep[][companion\npaper]{Cuestaetal2015} and report the consensus values: $H(z_{\\rm\nLOWZ})r_s(z_d)=(11.63\\pm0.69)\\cdot10^3 {\\rm km}s^{-1}$ and $D_A(z_{\\rm\nLOWZ})/r_s(z_d)=6.67\\pm0.15$ with $r_{HD_A}=0.35$ for the LOWZ sample;\n$H(z_{\\rm CMASS})r_s(z_d)=(14.67\\pm0.42)\\cdot10^3 {\\rm km}s^{-1}$ and\n$D_A(z_{\\rm CMASS})/r_s(z_d)=9.47\\pm0.12$ with $r_{HD_A}=0.52$ for the CMASS\nsample.\n", "  We measure and analyse the clustering of the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic\nSurvey (BOSS) relative to the line-of-sight (LOS), for LOWZ and CMASS galaxy\nsamples drawn from the final Data Release 12 (DR12). The LOWZ sample contains\n361\\,762 galaxies with an effective redshift of $z_{\\rm lowz}=0.32$, and the\nCMASS sample 777\\,202 galaxies with an effective redshift of $z_{\\rm\ncmass}=0.57$. From the power spectrum monopole and quadrupole moments around\nthe LOS, we measure the growth of structure parameter $f$ times the amplitude\nof dark matter density fluctuations $\\sigma_8$ by modeling the Redshift-Space\nDistortion signal. When the geometrical Alcock-Paczynski effect is also\nconstrained from the same data, we find joint constraints on $f\\sigma_8$, the\nproduct of the Hubble constant and the comoving sound horizon at the baryon\ndrag epoch $H(z)r_s(z_d)$, and the angular distance parameter divided by the\nsound horizon $D_A(z)/r_s(z_d)$. We find $f(z_{\\rm lowz})\\sigma_8(z_{\\rm\nlowz})=0.394\\pm0.062$, $D_A(z_{\\rm lowz})/r_s(z_d)=6.35\\pm0.19$, $H(z_{\\rm\nlowz})r_s(z_d)=(11.41\\pm 0.56)\\,{10^3\\rm km}s^{-1}$ for the LOWZ sample, and\n$f(z_{\\rm cmass})\\sigma_8(z_{\\rm cmass})=0.444\\pm0.038$, $D_A(z_{\\rm\ncmass})/r_s(z_d)=9.42\\pm0.15$, $H(z_{\\rm cmass})r_s(z_d)=(13.92 \\pm 0.44)\\,\n{10^3\\rm km}s^{-1}$ for the CMASS sample. We find general agreement with\nprevious BOSS DR11 measurements. Assuming the Hubble parameter and angular\ndistance parameter are fixed at fiducial $\\Lambda$CDM values, we find $f(z_{\\rm\nlowz})\\sigma_8(z_{\\rm lowz})=0.485\\pm0.044$ and $f(z_{\\rm\ncmass})\\sigma_8(z_{\\rm cmass})=0.436\\pm0.022$ for the LOWZ and CMASS samples,\nrespectively.\n", "  We report the observation of quantum dynamical oscillations of ultracold\natomic gases in the F and D bands of a single-well optical lattice. We are able\nto control the Bragg reflections at the Brillouin zone edge up to the third\norder. As a result, we can switch the quantum dynamics from oscillations across\nboth the F and D bands to oscillations only within the F-band. Our capability\nto observe these remarkable oscillations comes from the innovative\nnon-adiabatic technique which allows us to load ultracold atoms efficiently to\nthe G-band of an optical lattice.\n", "  Using semiclassical methods, it is possible to construct very accurate\napproximations in the short wavelength limit of quantum dynamics that rely\nexclusively on classical dynamical input. For systems whose classical\nrealization is strongly chaotic, there is an exceedingly short logarithmic\nEhrenfest time scale, beyond which the quantum and classical dynamics of a\nsystem necessarily diverge, and yet the semiclassical construction remains\nvalid far beyond that time. This fact leads to a paradox if one ponders the\nreversibility and predictability properties of quantum and classical mechanics.\nThey behave very differently relative to each other, with classical dynamics\nbeing essentially irreversible/unpredictable, whereas quantum dynamics is\nreversible/stable. This begs the question, \"how can an accurate approximation\nto a reversible/stable dynamics be constructed from an\nirreversible/unpredictable one?\" The resolution of this incongruity depends on\na couple key ingredients, a well-known, inherent, one-way structural stability\nof chaotic systems and an overlap integral not being amenable to the saddle\npoint method.\n", "  In order to study quantum measurement theory, sequential product defined for\nany two quantum effects is introduced. Physically motivated conditions ask the\nsequential product to be continuous with respect to the strong operator\ntopology. In this paper, we study the continuity problems of the sequential\nproduct with respect to the other important topologies, as norm topology, weak\noperator topology, order topology, interval topology, etc.\n", "  Considerable recent attention has been given to the study of shape formation\nusing modern responsive materials that can be preprogrammed to undergo\nspatially inhomogeneous local deformations. In particular, nematic liquid\ncrystal polymer networks offer exciting possibilities in this context. In this\npaper, we discuss the generation of Gaussian curvature in thin nematic sheets\nusing smooth in-plane director fields patterned across the surface. We\nhighlight specific patterns which encode constant Gaussian curvature of\nprescribed sign and magnitude and present experimental results which appear to\nsupport the theoretical predictions. Specifically, we provide experimental\nevidence for the realization of positive and negative Gaussian curvature in\nglassy and elastomeric liquid crystal polymer networks through the stimulation\nof smoothly varying in-plane director fields.\n", "  We study a generalization of nonlocal games---which we call extended nonlocal\ngames---in which the players, Alice and Bob, initially share a tripartite\nquantum state with the referee. In such games, the winning conditions for Alice\nand Bob may depend on outcomes of measurements made by the referee, on its part\nof the shared quantum state, in addition to Alice and Bob's answers to randomly\nselected questions. Our study of this class of games was inspired by the\nmonogamy-of-entanglement games introduced by Tomamichel, Fehr, Kaniewski, and\nWehner, which they also generalize. We prove that a natural extension of the\nNavascues--Pironio--Acin hierarchy of semidefinite programs converges to the\noptimal commuting operator value of extended nonlocal games, and we prove two\nextensions of results of Tomamichel et al. concerning monogamy-of-entanglement\ngames.\n", "  Recently we pointed out the so-called Local Time Scheme as a novel approach\nto quantum foundations that solves the preferred pointer-basis problem. In this\npaper we introduce and analyze in depth a rather non-standard dynamical map\nthat is imposed by the scheme. On one hand, the map does not allow for\nintroducing a properly defined generator of the evolution nor does it represent\na quantum channel. On the other hand, the map is linear, positive, trace\npreserving and unital as well as completely positive, but is not divisible and\ntherefore non-Markovian. Nevertheless, we provide quantitative criteria for\ndynamical emergence of time-coarse-grained Markovianity, for exact dynamics of\nan open system, as well as for operationally-defined approximation of a closed\nor open many-particle system. A closed system never reaches a steady state,\nwhile an open system may reach a unique steady state given by the L\\\" uders-von\nNeumann formula; where the smaller the open system, the faster a steady state\nis attained. These generic findings extend the standard open quantum systems\ntheory and substantially tackle certain cosmological issues.\n", "  We point out a surprising consequence of the usually assumed initial\nconditions for cosmological perturbations. Namely, a spectrum of Gaussian,\nlinear, adiabatic, scalar, growing mode perturbations not only creates acoustic\noscillations of the kind observed on very large scales today, it also leads to\nthe production of shocks in the radiation fluid of the very early universe.\nShocks cause departures from local thermal equilibrium as well as creating\nvorticity and gravitational waves. For a scale-invariant spectrum and standard\nmodel physics, shocks form for temperatures $1$ GeV$<T<10^{7}$ GeV. For more\ngeneral power spectra, such as have been invoked to form primordial black\nholes, shock formation and the consequent gravitational wave emission provides\na signal detectable by current and planned gravitational wave experiments,\nallowing them to strongly constrain conditions present in the primordial\nuniverse as early as $10^{-30}$ seconds after the big bang.\n", "  We analytically study membrane mediated interactions between inclusions\nembedded in a tubular membrane. We model inclusions as constraints coupled to\nthe curvature tensor of the membrane tube. First, as special test cases, we\nanalyze the interaction between ring and rod shaped inclusions. Using Monte\nCarlo simulations, we further show how point-like inclusions interact to form\nlinear aggregates. Our results reveal that depending on the hard-core radius of\nthe inclusions, they arrange into either lines or rings to globally minimize\nthe curvature energy of the membrane.\n", "  The standard analytical approach for studying gravity free-surface waves\ngenerated by a moving body often relies upon a linearization of the physical\ngeometry, where the body is considered asymptotically small in one or several\nof its dimensions. In this paper, a methodology that avoids any such\ngeometrical simplification is presented for the case of flows at low speeds.\nThe approach is made possible through a reduction of the water-wave equations\nto a complex-valued integral equation that can be studied using the method of\nsteepest descents. The main result is a theory that establishes a\ncorrespondence between a given physical flow geometry, with the topology of the\nRiemann surface formed by the steepest descent paths. Then, when a geometrical\nfeature of the body is modified, a corresponding change to the Riemann surface\nis observed, and the resultant effects to the water waves can be derived. This\nvisual procedure is demonstrated for the case of two-dimensional free-surface\nflow past a surface-piercing ship and over an angled step in a channel.\n", "  Motivated by limitations and capabilities of neutral atom qubits, we examine\nwhether measurement-free error correction can produce practical error\nthresholds. We show that this can be achieved by extracting redundant syndrome\ninformation, giving our procedure extra fault tolerance and eliminating the\nneed for ancilla verification. The procedure is particularly favorable when\nmulti-qubit gates are available for the correction step. Simulations of the\nbit-flip, Bacon-Shor, and Steane codes indicate that coherent error correction\ncan produce threshold error rates that are on the order of $10^{-3}$ to\n$10^{-4}$---comparable with or better than measurement-based values, and much\nbetter than previous results for other coherent error correction schemes. This\nindicates that coherent error correction is worthy of serious consideration for\nachieving protected logical qubits.\n", "  We develop a stochastic formulation of the optimally-tuned range-separated\nhybrid density functional theory which enables significant reduction of the\ncomputational effort and scaling of the non-local exchange operator at the\nprice of introducing a controllable statistical error. Our method is based on\nstochastic representations of the Coulomb convolution integral and of the\ngeneralized Kohn-Sham density matrix. The computational cost of the approach is\nsimilar to that of usual Kohn-Sham density functional theory, yet it provides\nmuch more accurate description of the quasiparticle energies for the frontier\norbitals. This is illustrated for a series of silicon nanocrystals up to sizes\nexceeding 3000 electrons. Comparison with the stochastic GW many-body\nperturbation technique indicates excellent agreement for the fundamental band\ngap energies, good agreement for the band-edge quasiparticle excitations, and\nvery low statistical errors in the total energy for large systems. The present\napproach has a major advantage over one-shot GW by providing a self-consistent\nHamiltonian which is central for additional post-processing, for example in the\nstochastic Bethe-Salpeter approach.\n", "  The Stratum Corneum (SC), the outermost layer of skin, comprises rigid\ncorneocytes (keratin filled dead cells) in a specialized lipid matrix. The\ncontinuous lipid matrix provides the main barrier against uncontrolled water\nloss and invasion of external pathogens. Unlike all other biological lipid\nmembranes (like intracellular organelles and plasma membranes), molecules in SC\nlipid matrix show small hydrophilic group and large variability in the length\nof the alkyl tails and in the numbers and positions of groups that are capable\nof forming hydrogen bonds. Molecular simulations provide a route for\nsystematically probing the effects of each of these differences separately. In\nthis article we present results from atomistic molecular dynamics of selected\nlipid bilayers and multilayers to probe the effect of these polydispersities.\nWe address the nature of the tail packing in the gel-like phase, the hydrogen\nbond network among head groups, the bending moduli expected for leaflets\ncomprising SC lipids, and the conformation of very long ceramide lipids (EOS)\nin multibilayer lipid assemblies.\n", "  Characterising the stratosphere as a turbulent system, temporal fluctuations\noften show different correlations for different time scales as well as\nintermittent behaviour that cannot be captured by a single scaling exponent. In\nthis study, the different scaling laws in the long term stratospheric\nvariability are studied using Multifractal de-trended Fluctuation Analysis. The\nanalysis is performed comparing four re-analysis products and different\nrealisations of an idealised numerical model, isolating the role of topographic\nforcing and seasonal variability, as well as the absence of climate\nteleconnections and small-scale forcing. The Northern Hemisphere (NH) shows a\ntransition of scaling exponents for time scales shorter than about one year,\nfor which the variability is multifractal and scales in time with a power law\ncorresponding to a red spectrum, to longer time scales, for which the\nvariability is monofractal and scales in time with a power law corresponding to\nwhite noise. Southern Hemisphere (SH) variability also shows a transition at\nannual scales. The SH also shows a narrower dynamical range in multifractality\nthan the NH, as seen in the generalised Hurst exponent and in the singularity\nspectra. The numerical integrations show that the models are able to reproduce\nthe low-frequency variability but are not able to fully capture the shorter\nterm variability of the stratosphere.\n", "  We study the collective, superradiant behavior in the system of\nemitter-dressed Ag nanorods. Starting from the Drude model for the plasmon\noscillations, we arrive at a semi-empirical Hamiltonian describing the coupling\nbetween quantized surface plasmon modes and the quantum emitters that can be\ncontrolled by manipulating their geometry, spacing, and orientation. Further,\nidentifying the lowest polariton mode as SP-states dressed by excitons in the\nvicinity of $k=0$, we examine conditions allowing for the polariton quantum\nphase transition. While the system is formally a 1D array, we show that the\npolariton states of interest can undergo a quantum phase transition to form a\nBose condensate at finite temperatures for physically accessible parameter\nranges.\n", "  We provide a detailed derivation of the analytical expansion of the lunar and\nsolar disturbing functions. Although there exist several papers on this topic,\nmany derivations contain mistakes in the final expansion or rather (just) in\nthe proof, thereby necessitating a recasting and correction of the original\nderivation. In this work, we provide a self-consistent and definite form of the\nlunisolar expansion. We start with Kaula's expansion of the disturbing function\nin terms of the equatorial elements of both the perturbed and perturbing\nbodies. Then we give a detailed proof of Lane's expansion, in which the\nelements of the Moon are referred to the ecliptic plane. Using this approach\nthe inclination of the Moon becomes nearly constant, while the argument of\nperihelion, the longitude of the ascending node, and the mean anomaly vary\nlinearly with time.\n  We make a comparison between the different expansions and we profit from such\ndiscussion to point out some mistakes in the existing literature, which might\ncompromise the correctness of the results. As an application, we analyze the\nlong--term motion of the highly elliptical and critically--inclined Molniya\norbits subject to quadrupolar gravitational interactions. The analytical\nexpansions presented herein are very powerful with respect to dynamical studies\nbased on Cartesian equations, because they quickly allow for a more holistic\nand intuitively understandable picture of the dynamics.\n", "  In this note we explore the validity of the first law of entanglement entropy\nin the context of the topologically massive gravity (TMG). We found that the\nvariation of the holographic entanglement entropy under perturbation from the\npure AdS background satisfies the first law upon imposing the bulk equations of\nmotion in a given time slice, despite the appearance of instabilities in the\nbulk for generic gravitationl Chern-Simons coupling $\\mu$. The black hole\nentropy is different from the holographic entanglement entropy in a general\nboosted frame. This discrepancy however do not affect the entanglement first\nlaw.\n", "  We study the entanglement structure of lattice gauge theories from the local\noperational point of view, and, similar to Soni and Trivedi (arXiv:1510.07455),\nwe show that the usual entanglement entropy for a spatial bipartition can be\nwritten as the sum of an undistillable gauge part and of another part\ncorresponding to the LOCC distillable entanglement, which is obtained by\ndepolarizing the local superselection sectors. We demonstrate that the\ndistillable entanglement is zero for pure abelian gauge theories in the weak\ncoupling limit, while it is in general nonzero for the nonabelian case. We also\nconsider gauge theories with matter, and show in a perturbative approach how\narea laws -- including a topological correction -- emerge for the distillable\nentanglement.\n", "  Characterizing the link between small-scale chromatin structure and\nlarge-scale chromosome folding during interphase is a prerequisite for\nunderstanding transcription. Yet, this link remains poorly investigated. Here,\nwe introduce a simple biophysical model where interphase chromosomes are\ndescribed in terms of the folding of chromatin sequences composed of\nalternating blocks of fibers with different thicknesses and flexibilities, and\nwe use it to study the influence of sequence disorder on chromosome behaviors\nin space and time. By employing extensive computer simulations,we thus\ndemonstrate that chromosomes undergo noticeable conformational changes only on\nlength-scales smaller than $10^5$ basepairs and time-scales shorter than a few\nseconds, and we suggest there might exist effective upper bounds to the\ndetection of chromosome reorganization in eukaryotes. We prove the relevance of\nour framework by modeling recent experimental FISH data on murine chromosomes.\n", "  In the field of optomechanics, radiation forces have provided a particularly\nhigh level of control over the frequency and dissipation of mechanical\nelements. Here we propose a class of optomechanical systems in which light\nexerts a similarly profound influence over two other fundamental parameters:\ngeometry and mass. By applying an optical trap to one lattice site of an\nextended phononic crystal, we show it is possible to create a tunable,\nlocalized mechanical mode. Owing to light's simultaneous and constructive\ncoupling with the structure's continuum of modes, we estimate that a trap power\nat the level of a single intracavity photon should be capable of producing a\nsignificant effect within a realistic, chip-scale device.\n", "  Rough or textured hydrophobic surfaces are dubbed superhydrophobic due to\ntheir numerous desirable properties, such as water repellency and interfacial\nslip. Superhydrophobicity stems from an aversion for water to wet the surface\ntexture, so that a water droplet in the superhydrophobic \"Cassie state\",\ncontacts only the tips of the rough hydrophobic surface. However,\nsuperhydrophobicity is remarkably fragile, and can break down due to the\nwetting of the surface texture to yield the \"Wenzel state\" under various\nconditions, such as elevated pressures or droplet impact. Moreover, due to\nlarge energetic barriers that impede the reverse (dewetting) transition, this\nbreakdown in superhydrophobicity is widely believed to be irreversible. Using\nmolecular simulations in conjunction with enhanced sampling techniques, here we\nshow that on surfaces with nanoscale texture, water density fluctuations can\nlead to a reduction in the free energetic barriers to dewetting by\ncircumventing the classical dewetting pathways. In particular, the\nfluctuation-mediated dewetting pathway involves a number of transitions between\ndistinct dewetted morphologies, with each transition lowering the resistance to\ndewetting. Importantly, an understanding of the mechanistic pathways to\ndewetting and their dependence on pressure, allows us to augment the surface\ntexture design, so that the barriers to dewetting are eliminated altogether and\nthe Wenzel state becomes unstable at ambient conditions. Such robust surfaces,\nwhich defy classical expectations and can spontaneously recover their\nsuperhydrophobicity, could have widespread importance, from underwater\noperation to phase change heat transfer applications.\n", "  Coherent optical control of individual particles has been demonstrated both\nfor atoms and semiconductor quantum dots. Here we demonstrate the emergence of\nquantum coherent effects in semiconductor Rydberg excitons in bulk Cu$_2$O. Due\nto the spectral proximity between two adjacent Rydberg exciton states, a\nsingle-frequency laser may pump both resonances with little dissipation from\nthe detuning. As a consequence, additional resonances appear in the absorption\nspectrum that correspond to dressed states consisting of two Rydberg exciton\nlevels coupled to the excitonic vacuum, forming a V-type three-level system,\nbut driven only by one laser light source. We show that the level of pure\ndephasing in this system is extremely low. These observations are a crucial\nstep towards coherently controlled quantum technologies in a bulk\nsemiconductor.\n", "  Temporal contact networks are studied to understand dynamic spreading\nphenomena such as communicable diseases or information dissemination. To\nestablish how spatiotemporal dynamics of nodes impact spreading potential in\ncolocation contact networks, we propose \"inducement-shuffling\" null models\nwhich break one or more correlations between times, locations and nodes. By\nreconfiguring the time and/or location of each node's presence in the network,\nthese models induce alternative sets of colocation events giving rise to\ncontact networks with varying spreading potential. This enables second-order\ncausal reasoning about how correlations in nodes' spatiotemporal preferences\nnot only lead to a given contact network but ultimately influence the network's\nspreading potential. We find the correlation between nodes and times to be the\ngreatest impediment to spreading, while the correlation between times and\nlocations slightly catalyzes spreading. Under each of the presented null models\nwe measure both the number of contacts and infection prevalence as a function\nof time, with the surprising finding that the two have no direct causality.\n", "  Maxwell's mature presentation of his equations emphasized the unity of\nelectromagnetism and mechanics, subsuming both as \"dynamical systems\". That\nintuition of unity has proved both fruitful, as a source of pregnant concepts,\nand broadly inspiring. A deep aspect of Maxwell's work is its use of redundant\npotentials, and the associated requirement of gauge symmetry. Those concepts\nhave become central to our present understanding of fundamental physics, but\nthey can appear to be rather formal and esoteric. Here I discuss two things:\nThe physical significance of gauge invariance, in broad terms; and some\ntantalizing prospects for further unification, building on that concept, that\nare visible on the horizon today. If those prospects are realized, Maxwell's\nvision of the unity of field and substance will be brought to a new level.\n", "  In this work, we present a consistent Hamiltonian analysis of cosmological\nperturbations at all orders. To make the procedure transparent, we consider a\nsimple model and resolve the `gauge-fixing' issues and extend the analysis to\nscalar field models and show that our approach can be applied to any order of\nperturbation for any first order derivative fields. In the case of Galilean\nscalar fields, our procedure can extract constrained relations at all orders in\nperturbations leading to the fact that there is no extra degrees of freedom due\nto the presence of higher time derivatives of the field in the Lagrangian. We\ncompare and contrast our approach to the Lagrangian approach (Chen et al\n[2006]) for extracting higher order correlations and show that our approach is\nquick and robust and can be applied to any model of gravity and matter fields.\n", "  Majorana bound states (MBS) differ from the regular zero energy Andreev bound\nstates in their nonlocal properties, since two MBS form a single fermion. We\ndesign strategies for detection of this nonlocality by using the phenomenon of\nCoulomb-mediated Majorana coupling in a simplest setting which still retains\nfalsifiability. Focusing on the implementation of MBS based on the quantum spin\nHall effect, we also design a way to probe Majoranas without the need to open a\nmagnetic gap in the helical edge states. In the setup that we analyse, long\nrange MBS coupling manifests in the $h/e$ magnetic flux periodicity of\ntunneling conductance and supercurrent. While $h/e$ is also the periodicity of\nAharonov-Bohm effect and persistent current, we show how to ensure its Majorana\norigin by verifying that switching off the charging energy restores $h/2e$\nperiodicity conventional for superconducting systems.\n", "  We present a source-plane reconstruction of a ${\\it Herschel}$ and ${\\it\nPlanck}$-detected gravitationally-lensed dusty star-forming galaxy (DSFG) at\n$z=1.68$ using {\\it Hubble}, Sub-millimeter Array (SMA), and Keck observations.\nThe background sub-millimeter galaxy (SMG) is strongly lensed by a foreground\ngalaxy cluster at $z=0.997$ and appears as an arc of length $\\sim 15^{\\prime\n\\prime}$ in the optical images. The continuum dust emission, as seen by SMA, is\nlimited to a single knot within this arc. We present a lens model with source\nplane reconstructions at several wavelengths to show the difference in\nmagnification between the stars and dust, and highlight the importance of a\nmulti-wavelength lens models for studies involving lensed DSFGs. We estimate\nthe physical properties of the galaxy by fitting the flux densities to model\nSEDs leading to a magnification-corrected star formation rate of $390 \\pm 60$\nM$_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ and a stellar mass of $1.1 \\pm 0.4\\times 10^{11}$\nM$_{\\odot}$. These values are consistent with high-redshift massive galaxies\nthat have formed most of their stars already. The estimated gas-to-baryon\nfraction, molecular gas surface density, and SFR surface density have values of\n$0.43 \\pm 0.13$, $350 \\pm 200$ M$_{\\odot}$ pc$^{-2}$, and $\\sim 12 \\pm\n7~$M$_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-2}$, respectively. The ratio of star formation\nrate surface density to molecular gas surface density puts this among the most\nstar-forming systems, similar to other measured SMGs and local ULIRGS.\n", "  We develop a method to study the effect of the superconducting transition on\nresonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) signal in superconductors with an\norder parameter with an arbitrary symmetry within a quasiparticle approach. As\nan example, we compare the direct RIXS signal below and above the\nsuperconducting transition for p-wave type order parameters. For a p-wave order\nparameter with a nodal line, we show that, counterintuitively, the effect of\nthe gap is most noticeable for momentum transfers in the nodal direction. This\nphenomenon may be naturally explained as a type of nesting effect.\n", "  New spatially scanned spectropolarimetry sunspot observations are made of\nphotospheric atomic and molecular absorption lines near 4135nm. The relative\nsplittings among several atomic lines are measured and shown to agree with\nvalues calculated with configuration interaction and intermediate coupling.\nLarge splitting is seen in a line identified with Fe I at 4137nm, showing\nmultiple Stokes V components and an unusual linear polarization. This line will\nbe a sensitive probe of quiet Sun magnetic fields, with a magnetic sensitivity\nof 2.5 times larger than that of the well-known 1565nm Fe I line.\n", "  We investigate the spin-resolved transport in a two-terminal zigzag graphene\nnanoribbon device with two independent gate induced Rashba spin-orbit coupling\nregions and in the presence of strain. By employing a recursive Green's\nfunction technique to the tight-binding model for the graphene nanoribbon, we\ncalculate the spin-resolved conductance of the system. We show that by\nswitching the sign of one of the gates it is possible to select which spin\ncomponent will be transmitted. Moreover, our results show that an uniaxial\nstrain applied to the nanoribbon plays a significant role in the transport,\nproviding and additional manner to control the spin-polarized conductance. This\nmakes the present system a potential candidate for future implementations of\nspin-based mechanical strain sensors.\n", "  We show that Berezinskii's classification of the symmetries of Cooper pair\namplitudes holds for driven systems even in the absence of translation\ninvariance. We then consider a model Hamiltonian for a superconductor coupled\nto an external driving potential and, treating the driving potential as a\nperturbation, we investigate the corrections to the anomalous Green's function,\ndensity of states, and spectral function. We find that in the presence of an\nexternal drive the anomalous Green's function develops terms that are odd in\nfrequency and that the same mechanism responsible for these odd-frequency terms\ngenerates additional features in the density of states and spectral function.\n", "  The generation of gravitational waves by laser accelerated relativistic ions\nis investigated. The piston and light sail models of laser plasma acceleration\nare considered and analytical expressions for space-time metric perturbation\nare derived. For both models the dependence of gravitational waves amplitude on\nthe laser and plasma parameters as well as gravitational waves spectrum and\nangular distribution are examined\n", "  Realistic models of neutron and quark stars in the framework of mimetic\ngravity with Lagrange multiplier constraint are presented. We discuss the\neffect of mimetic scalar aiming to describe dark matter on mass-radius relation\nand the moment of inertia for slowly rotating relativistic stars. The\nmass-radius relation and moment of inertia depend on the value of mimetic\nscalar in the center of star. This fact leads to the ambiguity in the\nmass-radius relation for a given equation of state. {Such ambiguity allows to\nexplain some observational facts better than in standard General Relativity}.\nThe case of two mimetic potentials namely $V(\\phi)\\sim A\\phi^{-2}$ and\n$V(\\phi)\\sim Ae^{B\\phi^{2}}$ is considered in detail. The relative deviation of\nmaximal moment of inertia is approximately twice larger than the relative\ndeviation of maximal stellar mass. We also briefly discuss the mimetic $f(R)$\ngravity. In the case of $f(R)=R+aR^2$ mimetic gravity it is expected that\nincrease of maximal mass and maximal moment of inertia due to mimetic scalar\nbecomes much stronger with bigger parameter $a$. The contribution of scalar\nfield in mimetic gravity can lead to possible existence of extreme neutron\nstars with large masses.\n", "  The $\\eta^\\prime$ transition form factor is reanalyzed in view of the recent\nBESIII first observation of the Dalitz decay $\\eta^\\prime\\to\\gamma e^+e^-$ in\nboth space- and time-like regions at low and intermediate energies using the\nPad\\'e approximants method. The present analysis provides a suitable\nparameterization for reproducing the measured form factor in the whole energy\nregion and allows to extract the corresponding low-energy parameters together\nwith a prediction of its values at the origin, related to\n$\\Gamma_{\\eta^\\prime\\to\\gamma\\gamma}$, and the asymptotic limit. The\n$\\eta$-$\\eta^\\prime$ mixing is reassessed within a mixing scheme compatible\nwith the large-$N_c$ chiral perturbation theory at next-to-leading order, with\nparticular attention to the OZI-rule--violating parameters. The $J/\\psi$,\n$Z\\to\\eta^{(\\prime)}\\gamma$ decays are also considered and predictions\nreported.\n", "  The zero to four loop contribution to the cross section $R_{e^{+}e^{-}}$ for\n$e^{+}e^{-} \\longrightarrow$ hadrons, when combined with the renormalization\ngroup equation, allows for summation of all leading-log ($LL$),\nnext-to-leading-log $(NLL) \\ldots N^3LL$ perturbative contributions. It is also\nshown how all logarithmic contributions to $R_{e^{+}e^{-}}$ can be summed and\nthat $R_{e^{+}e^{-}}$ can be expressed in terms of the log independent\ncontributions, and once this is done the running coupling $a$ is evaluated at a\npoint independent of the renormalization scale $\\mu$. All explicit dependence\nof $R_{e^{+}e^{-}}$ on $\\mu$ cancels against its implicit dependence on $\\mu$\nthrough the running coupling $a$ so that the ambiguity associated with the\nvalue of $\\mu$ is shown to disappear. The renormalization scheme dependency of\nthe \"summed\" cross section $R_{e^{+}e^{-}}$ is examined in three distinct\nrenormalization schemes. In each case, $R_{e^{+}e^{-}}$ is expressible in terms\nof renormalization scheme independent parameters $\\tau_i$ and is explicitly and\nimplicitly independent of the renormalization scale $\\mu$. Two of the forms are\nthen compared graphically both with each other and with the purely perturbative\nresults and the $RG$-summed $N^3LL$ results.\n", "  The critical scaling of the large-$N$ $O(N)$ model in higher dimensions using\nthe exact renormalization group equations has been studied, motivated by the\nrecently found non-trivial fixed point in $4<d<6$ dimensions with metastable\ncritical potential. Particular attention is paid to the case of $d=5$ where the\nscaling exponent $\\nu$ has the value $1/3$, which coincides with the scaling\nexponent of quantum gravity in one fewer dimensions. Convincing results show\nthat this relation could be generalized to arbitrary number of dimensions above\nfive. Some aspects of AdS/CFT correspondence are also discussed.\n", "  For a gapped disordered many-body system with both internal and translation\nsymmetry, one can define the corresponding weak and strong Symmetry Protected\nTopological (SPT) phases. A strong SPT phase is protected by the internal\nsymmetry $G$ only while a weak SPT phase, fabricated by alignment of strong SPT\nstate in a lower dimension, requires additional discrete translation symmetry\nprotection. In this paper, we construct a phase transition between weak and\nstrong SPT phase in strongly interacting boson system. The starting point of\nour construction is the superconducting Dirac fermions with pair density\nwave(PDW) order in $2d$. We first demonstrate that the nodal line of the PDW\ncontains a $1d$ boson SPT phase. We further show that melting the PDW stripe\nand condensing the nodal line provoke the transition from weak to strong SPT\nphase in $2d$. The phase transition theory contains an O(4)\nnon-linear-$\\sigma$-model(NL$\\sigma$M) with topological $\\Theta$-term emerging\nfrom the proliferation of domain walls bound to an SPT chain. Similar scheme\nalso applies to weak-strong SPT transition in other dimensions and predicts\npossible phase transition from $2d$ to $3d$ topological order.\n", "  Several prominent transport properties have been identified as key signatures\nof topologicalmaterials. One is the resistivity plateau at low temperatures as\nobserved in several topological insulators (TIs), another is the negative\nmagnetoresistance (MR) when the applied magnetic field is parallel to the\ncurrent direction as observed in several topological semimetals (TSMs)\nincluding Dirac semimetals (DSMs) and Weyl semimetals (WSMs). Usually, these\ntwo exotic phenomena emerge in distinct materials with or without time reversal\nsymmetry (TRS), respectively. Here we report the discovery of a new member in\nTSMs, TaSb2, which clearly exhibits both of these phenomena in a single\nmaterial. This compound crystallizes in a base-centered monoclinic,\ncentrosymmetric structure, and is metallic with a low carrier density in the\nzero field. While applying magnetic field it exhibits insulating behavior\nbefore appearance of a resistivity plateau below Tc =13 K. In the plateau\nregime, the ultrahigh carrier mobility and extreme magnetoresistance (XMR) for\nthe field perpendicular to the current are observed as in DSMs and WSMs, in\naddition to a quantum oscillation behavior with non-trivial Berry phases. In\ncontrast to the most known DSMs and WSMs, the negative MR in TaSb2 does not\nsaturate up to 9 T, which, together with the almost linear Hall resistivity,\nmanifests itself an electron-hole non-compensated TMS. These findings indicate\nthat the resistivity plateau could be a generic feature of topology-protected\nmetallic states even in the absence of TRS and compatible with the negative MR\ndepending on the field direction. Our experiment extends a materials basis\nrepresented by TaSb2 as a new platform for future theoretical investigations\nand device applications of topological materials.\n", "  We report on nano-optical imaging study of WSe2 thin flakes with the scanning\nnear-field optical microscopy (NSOM). The NSOM technique allows us to visualize\nin real space various waveguide photon modes inside WSe2. By tuning the\nexcitation laser energy, we are able to map the entire dispersion of these\nwaveguide modes both above and below the A exciton energy of WSe2. We found\nthat all the modes interact strongly with WSe2 excitons. The outcome of the\ninteraction is that the observed waveguide modes shift to higher momenta right\nbelow the A exciton energy. At higher energies, on the other hand, these modes\nare strongly damped due to adjacent B excitons or band edge absorptions. The\nmode-shifting phenomena are consistent with polariton formation in WSe2.\n", "  The macroscopic behavior of dense suspensions of neutrally-buoyant spheres in\nturbulent plane channel flow is examined. We show that particles larger than\nthe smallest turbulence scales cause the suspension to deviate from the\ncontinuum limit in which its dynamics is well described by an effective\nsuspension viscosity. This deviation is caused by the formation of a particle\nlayer close to the wall with significant slip velocity. By assuming two\ndistinct transport mechanisms in the near-wall layer and the turbulence in the\nbulk, we define an effective wall location such that the flow in the bulk can\nstill be accurately described by an effective suspension viscosity. We thus\npropose scaling laws for the mean velocity profile of the suspension flow,\ntogether with a master equation able to predict the increase in drag as\nfunction of the particle size and volume fraction.\n", "  The Standard Model of particle physics encapsulates our current best\nunderstanding of physics at the smallest distances and highest energies. It\nincorporates Quantum Electrodynamics (the quantised version of Maxwell's\nelectromagnetism) and the weak and strong interactions, and has survived\nunmodified for decades, save for the inclusion of non-zero neutrino masses\nafter the observation of neutrino oscillations in the late 1990s. It describes\na vast array of data over a wide range of energy scales. I review a selection\nof these successes, including the remarkably successful prediction of a new\nscalar boson, a qualitatively new kind of object observed in 2012 at the Large\nHadron Collider. New calculational techniques and experimental advances\nchallenge the Standard Model across an ever-wider range of phenomena, now\nextending significantly above the electroweak symmetry breaking scale. I will\noutline some of the consequences of these new challenges, and briefly discuss\nwhat is still to be found.\n", "  Relative motion between soft wet solids arises in a number of applications in\nnatural and artificial settings, and invariably couples elastic deformation and\nfluid flow. We explore this in a minimal setting by considering a\nfluid-immersed negatively-buoyant cylinder moving along a soft inclined wall.\nOur experiments show that there is an emergent robust steady-state sliding\nregime of the cylinder with an effective friction that is significantly reduced\nrelative to that of rigid fluid-lubricated contacts. A simple scaling approach\nthat couples the cylinder-induced flow to substrate deformation allows us to\nexplain the emergence of an elastohydrodynamic lift that underlies the\nself-sustained lubricated motion of the cylinder, consistent with recent\ntheoretical predictions. Our results suggest an explanation for a range of\neffects such as reduced wear in animal joints and long-runout landslides, and\ncan be couched as a design principle for low-friction interfaces.\n", "  We present the first experimental realization of coherent Bragg scattering\noff a one-dimensional (1D) system -- two strings of atoms strongly coupled to a\nsingle photonic mode -- realized by trapping atoms in the evanescent field of a\ntapered optical fiber (TOF), which also guides the probe light. We report\nnearly 12% power reflection from strings containing only about one thousand\ncesium atoms, an enhancement of two orders of magnitude compared to reflection\nfrom randomly positioned atoms. This result paves the road towards collective\nstrong coupling in 1D atom-photon systems. Our approach also allows for a\nstraightforward fiber connection between several distant 1D atomic crystals.\n", "  The digital exhaust left by flows of physical and digital commodities\nprovides a rich measure of the nature, strength and significance of\nrelationships between countries in the global network. With this work, we\nexamine how these traces and the network structure can reveal the socioeconomic\nprofile of different countries. We take into account multiple international\nnetworks of physical and digital flows, including the previously unexplored\ninternational postal network. By measuring the position of each country in the\nTrade, Postal, Migration, International Flights, IP and Digital Communications\nnetworks, we are able to build proxies for a number of crucial socioeconomic\nindicators such as GDP per capita and the Human Development Index ranking along\nwith twelve other indicators used as benchmarks of national wellbeing by the\nUnited Nations and other international organisations. In this context, we have\nalso proposed and evaluated a global connectivity degree measure applying\nmultiplex theory across the six networks that accounts for the strength of\nrelationships between countries. We conclude with a multiplex community\nanalysis of the global flow networks, showing how countries with shared\ncommunity membership over multiple networks have similar socioeconomic\nprofiles. Combining multiple flow data sources into global multiplex networks\ncan help understand the forces which drive economic activity on a global level.\nSuch an ability to infer proxy indicators in a context of incomplete\ninformation is extremely timely in light of recent discussions on measurement\nof indicators relevant to the Sustainable Development Goals.\n", "  We study in detail a peculiar configuration of the Talbot-Lau matter wave\ninterferometer, characterised by unequal distances between the two diffraction\ngratings and the observation plane. We refer to this apparatus as the\n\"asymmetric Talbot-Lau setup\". Particular attention is given to its\ncapabilities as an inertial sensor for particle and atomic beams, also in\ncomparison with the classical moir\\'e deflectometer. The present analysis is\nmotivated by possible experimental applications in the context of antimatter\nwave interferometry, including the measurement of the gravitational\nacceleration of antimatter particles. To support our findings, we have\nperformed numerical simulations of realistic particle beams with varying speed\ndistributions.\n", "  We present a simple method and its experimental implementation to completely\ndetermine the characteristics of the pump-and-probe pulse and the Stokes pulse\nin a coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering microscope at sample level without\nadditional autocorrelators. Our approach exploits the delay line, ubiquitous in\nsuch microscopes, to perform a convolution of the pump-and-probe and Stokes\npulses as a function of their relative delay and it is based on the detection\nof the photons emitted from an appropriate non-linear sample. The analysis of\nthe non-resonant four-wave-mixing and sum-frequency-generation signals allows\nretrieving the pulse duration on the sample and the chirp of each pulse. This\nknowledge is crucial in maximizing the spectral-resolution and contrast in CARS\nimaging.\n", "  Using one channel to simulate another exactly with the aid of quantum\nno-signalling correlations has been studied recently. The one-shot\nno-signalling assisted classical zero-error simulation cost of non-commutative\nbipartite graphs has been formulated as semidefinite programms [Duan and\nWinter, IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 62, 891 (2016)]. Before our work, it was\nunknown whether the one-shot (or asymptotic) no-signalling assisted zero-error\nclassical simulation cost for general non-commutative graphs is multiplicative\n(resp. additive) or not. In this paper we address these issues and give a\ngeneral sufficient condition for the multiplicativity of the one-shot\nsimulation cost and the additivity of the asymptotic simulation cost of\nnon-commutative bipartite graphs, which include all known cases such as\nextremal graphs and classical-quantum graphs. Applying this condition, we\nexhibit a large class of so-called \\emph{cheapest-full-rank graphs} whose\nasymptotic zero-error simulation cost is given by the one-shot simulation cost.\nFinally, we disprove the multiplicativity of one-shot simulation cost by\nexplicitly constructing a special class of qubit-qutrit non-commutative\nbipartite graphs.\n", "  Relaxion models are an interesting new avenue to explain the radiative\nstability of the Standard Model scalar sector. They require very large field\nexcursions, which are difficult to generate in a consistent UV completion and\nto reconcile with the compact field space of the relaxion. We propose an N-site\nmodel which naturally generates the large decay constant needed to address\nthese issues. Our model offers distinct advantages with respect to previous\nproposals: the construction involves non-abelian fields, allowing for\ncontrolled high energy behaviour and more model building possibilities, both in\nparticle physics and inflationary models, and also admits a continuum limit\nwhen the number of sites is large, which may be interpreted as a warped extra\ndimension.\n", "  We analyze the directed flow of protons and pions in high-energy heavy-ion\ncollisions in the incident energy range from $\\sqrt{s_{{\\scriptscriptstyle\nNN}}}=7.7$ to 27 GeV within a microscopic transport model. Standard hadronic\ntransport approaches do not describe the collapse of directed flow below\n$\\sqrt{s_{{\\scriptscriptstyle NN}}}\\simeq 20$ GeV. By contrast, a model which\nsimulates effects of a softening of the equation of state, well describes the\nbehavior of directed flow data recently obtained by the STAR\nCollaboration~\\cite{STARv1}. We give a detailed analysis of how directed flow\nis generated. Particularly, we found that softening of effective equation of\nstate at the overlapping region of two nuclei, i.e. the reaction stages where\nthe system reaches high baryon density state, is needed to explain the observed\ncollapse of proton directed flow within a hadronic transport approach.\n", "  Active matter is a new class of material, intrinsically out-of equilibrium\nwith intriguing properties. So far, the recent upsurge of studies has mostly\nfocused on the spontaneous behavior of these systems --in the absence of\nexternal constraints or driving--. Yet, many real life systems evolve under\nconstraints, being both submitted to flow and various taxis. In the present\nwork, we demonstrate a new experimental system which opens up the way for\nquantitative investigations, and discriminating examinations, of the\nchallenging theoretical description of such systems. We explore the behavior of\nmagnetotactic bacteria as a particularly rich and versatile class of driven\nmatter, which behavior can be studied under contrasting and contradicting\nstimuli. In particular we demonstrate that the competing driving of an\norienting magnetic field and hydrodynamic flow lead not only to jetting, but\nalso unveils a new pearling instability. This illustrates new structuring\ncapabilities of driven active matter.\n", "  The evaluation of the numerically dominant pseudoscalar-pole contribution to\nhadronic light-by-light scattering in the muon g-2 involves the\npseudoscalar-photon transition form factor F_{P gamma^* gamma^*}(-Q_1^2,\n-Q_2^2) with P = pi^0, eta, eta^\\prime and, in general, two off-shell photons\nwith spacelike momenta Q_{1,2}^2. We show, in a largely model-independent way,\nthat for pi^0 (eta, eta^\\prime) the region of photon momenta below about 1\n(1.5) GeV gives the main contribution to hadronic light-by-light scattering. We\nthen discuss how the precision of current and future measurements of the\nsingle- and double-virtual transition form factor in different momentum regions\nimpacts the precision of a data-driven estimate of this contribution to\nhadronic light-by-light scattering. Based on Monte Carlo simulations for a\nplanned first measurement of the double-virtual form factor at BESIII, we find\nthat for the pi^0, eta, eta^\\prime-pole contributions a precision of 14\\%,\n23\\%, 15\\% seems feasible. Further improvements can be expected from other\nexperimental data and also from the use of dispersion relations for the\ndifferent form factors themselves.\n", "  We show that nano-mechanical vibrations in a magnetic shuttle device can be\nstrongly affected by external microwave irradiation through photo-assisted\nelectronic spin-flip transitions. Mechanical consequences of these spin-flips\nare due to a spin-dependent magnetic force, which may lead to a nano-mechanical\ninstability in the device. We derive a criterion for the instability to\nactually occur and analyze different regimes of possible nano-mechanical\noscillations. Possible experimental realizations of the spin-mediated\nphoto-mechanical instability and detection of the device back action are\ndiscussed.\n", "  Specific interactions are a hallmark feature of self-assembly and\nsignal-processing systems in both synthetic and biological settings.\nSpecificity between components may arise from a wide variety of physical and\nchemical mechanisms in diverse contexts, from DNA hybridization to\nshape-sensitive depletion interactions. Despite this diversity, all systems\nthat rely on interaction specificity operate under the constraint that\nincreasing the number of distinct components inevitably increases off-target\nbinding. Here we introduce `capacity', the maximal information encodable using\nspecific interactions, to compare specificity across diverse experimental\nsystems, and to compute how specificity changes with physical parameters. Using\nthis framework, we find that `shape'-coding of interactions has higher capacity\nthan chemical (`color') coding because the strength of off-target binding is\nstrongly sublinear in binding site size for shapes while being linear for\ncolors. We also find that different specificity mechanisms, such as shape and\ncolor, can be combined in a synergistic manner, giving a capacity greater than\nthe sum of the parts.\n", "  In the classical picture, electron-capture supernovae and the\naccretion-induced collapse of oxygen-neon white dwarfs (ONeWDs) undergo an\noxygen deflagration phase before gravitational collapse produces a neutron star\n(NS). These types of core collapse events are postulated to explain several\nastronomical phenomena. In this work, the deflagration phase is simulated for\nthe first time using multidimensional hydrodynamics, with the aim of gaining\nnew insight into the explosive deaths of $8-10~M_\\odot$ stars and ONeWDs that\naccrete material from a binary companion star. The main aim is to determine\nwhether these events are thermonuclear or core-collapse supernova explosions,\nand hence whether NSs are formed by such phenomena. The deflagration is\nsimulated in ONe cores with three different central ignition densities. The\nintermediate density case is perhaps the most realistic, being based on recent\nnuclear physics calculations and 1D stellar models. The 3D hydrodynamic\nsimulations presented in this work begin from a centrally confined flame\nstructure using a level-set-based flame approach and are performed in $256^3$\nand $512^3$ numerical resolutions. In the simulations with intermediate and low\nignition density, the cores do not appear to collapse into NSs. Instead, almost\na solar mass of material becomes unbound from the cores, leaving bound\nremnants. These simulations represent the case in which semiconvective mixing\nduring the electron-capture phase preceding the deflagration is inefficient.\nThe masses of the bound remnants double when Coulomb corrections are included\nin the EoS, however they still do not exceed the effective Chandrasekhar mass\nand, hence, would not collapse into NSs. The simulations with the highest\nignition density ($\\log_{10}\\rho_{\\rm c}=10.3$), representing the case where\nsemiconvective mixing is very efficient, show clear signs that the core will\ncollapse into a NS.\n", "  Selective control of qubits in a quantum register for the purposes of quantum\ninformation processing represents a critical challenge for dense spin ensembles\nin solid state systems. Here we present a protocol that achieves a complete set\nof selective single and two-qubit gates on nuclear spins in such an ensemble in\ndiamond facilitated by a nearby NV center. The protocol suppresses internuclear\ninteractions as well as unwanted coupling between the NV center and other spins\nof the ensemble to achieve quantum gate fidelities well exceeding 99% .\nNotably, our method can be applied to weakly coupled, distant, spins and\ntherefore represents a scalable procedure that exploits the exceptional\nproperties of nuclear spins in diamond as robust quantum memories.\n", "  We consider equatorial motion of particles in the ergoregion of generic\naxially symmetric rotating black holes. We introduce the notion of zero energy\nobservers (ZEOs) as counterparts to known zero angular observers (ZAMOs). It is\nshown that the trajectory of a ZEO has precisely one turning point that lies on\nthe boundary of the ergoregion for photons and inside the ergoregion for\nmassive particles. As a consequence, such trajectories enter the ergosphere\nfrom the white hole region under horizon and leave it crossing the horizon\nagain (entering the black hole region). The angular velocity of ZEO does not\ndepend on the angular momentum. For particles with $% E>0$ this velocity is\nbigger than for a ZEO, for $E<0$ it is smaller. General limitations on the\nangular momentum are found depending on whether the trajectory lies entirely\ninside the ergoregion, bounces back from the boundary or intersects it. These\nresults generalize the recent observations made in A. A. Grib, Yu. V. Pavlov,\narXiv:1601.02592 for the Kerr metric. We also show that collision between a ZEO\nand a particle with $E\\neq 0$ near a black hole can lead to the unbound energy\nin the centre of mass thus giving a special version of the Ba\\~{n}ados - Silk -\nWest effect.\n", "  We use the conformal bootstrap program to derive necessary conditions for\nemergent symmetry enhancement from discrete symmetry (e.g. $\\mathbb{Z}_n$) to\ncontinuous symmetry (e.g. $U(1)$) under the renormalization group flow. In\nthree dimensions, in order for $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry to be enhanced to $U(1)$\nsymmetry, the conformal bootstrap program predicts that the scaling dimension\nof the order parameter field at the infrared conformal fixed point must satisfy\n$\\Delta_1 > 1.08$. We also obtain the similar conditions for $\\mathbb{Z}_3$\nsymmetry with $\\Delta_{1} > 0.580$ and $\\mathbb{Z}_4$ symmetry with $\\Delta_1 >\n0.504$ from the simultaneous conformal bootstrap analysis of multiple\nfour-point functions. Our necessary conditions impose severe constraints on\nmany controversial physics such as the chiral phase transition in QCD, the\ndeconfinement criticality in N\\'eel-VBS transitions and anisotropic\ndeformations in critical $O(n)$ models. In some cases, we find that the\nconformal bootstrap program dashes hopes of emergent symmetry enhancement\nproposed in the literature.\n", "  Feynman-Hibbs (FH) effective potentials constitute an appealing approach for\ninvestigations of many-body systems at thermal equilibrium since they allow us\nto easily include quantum corrections within standard classical simulations. In\nthis work we apply the FH formulation to the study of Ne$_N$-coronene clusters\n($N=$ 1-4, 14) in the 2-14 K temperature range. Quadratic (FH2) and quartic\n(FH4) contributions to the effective potentials are built upon Ne-Ne and\nNe-coronene analytical potentials. In particular, a new corrected expression\nfor the FH4 effective potential is reported. FH2 and FH4 cluster energies and\nstructures -obtained from energy optimization through a basin-hoping algorithm\nas well as classical Monte Carlo simulations- are reported and compared with\nreference path integral Monte Carlo calculations. For temperatures $T> 4$ K,\nboth FH2 and FH4 potentials are able to correct the purely classical\ncalculations in a consistent way. However, the FH approach fails at lower\ntemperatures, especially the quartic correction. It is thus crucial to assess\nthe range of applicability of this formulation and, in particular, to apply the\nFH4 potentials with great caution. A simple model of $N$ isotropic harmonic\noscillators allows us to propose a means of estimating the cut-off temperature\nfor the validity of the method, which is found to increase with the number of\natoms adsorbed on the coronene molecule.\n", "  We present an effective model for a subwavelength periodically patterned\nmetallic layer, its cavities being filled with a nonlinear dielectric material,\nwhich accounts for both the linear and second order behavior. The effective non\nlinear susceptibility for the homogenized layer is driven by the nonlinearity\nof the dielectric material and by the geometrical parameters, thus leading to\nmuch higher susceptibility than existing materials. This leads to a huge\nenhancement of non linear processes when used together with resonances.\nFurthermore, multiple resonances are taking place in the metallic cavities, and\nwe investigate the mode matching situations for frequency conversion processes\nand show how it enhances further their efficiency.\n", "  We consider the consequence of nonreciprocity in near-field heat transfer by\nstudying systems consisting of magneto-optical nanoparticles.We demonstrate\nthat, in thermal equilibrium, a nonreciprocal many-body system in heat transfer\ncan support a persistent directional heat current, without violating the second\nlaw of thermodynamics. Such a persistent directional heat current cannot occur\nin reciprocal systems, and can only arise in many-body systems in heat\ntransfer. The use of nonreciprocity therefore points to a new regime of\nnear-field heat transfer for the control of heat flow in the nanoscale.\n", "  Background: Animal trade plays an important role for the spread of infectious\ndiseases in livestock populations. As a case study, we consider pig trade in\nGermany, where trade actors (agricultural premises) form a complex network. The\ncentral question is how infectious diseases can potentially spread within the\nsystem of trade contacts. We address this question by analyzing the underlying\nnetwork of animal movements.\n  Methodology/Findings: The considered pig trade dataset spans several years\nand is analyzed with respect to its potential to spread infectious diseases.\nFocusing on measurements of network-topological properties, we avoid the usage\nof external parameters, since these properties are independent of specific\npathogens. They are on the contrary of great importance for understanding any\ngeneral spreading process on this particular network. We analyze the system\nusing different network models, which include varying amounts of information:\n(i) static network, (ii) network as a time series of uncorrelated snapshots,\n(iii) temporal network, where causality is explicitly taken into account.\n  Findings: Our approach provides a general framework for a\ntopological-temporal characterization of livestock trade networks. We find that\na static network view captures many relevant aspects of the trade system, and\npremises can be classified into two clearly defined risk classes. Moreover, our\nresults allow for an efficient allocation strategy for intervention measures\nusing centrality measures. Data on trade volume does barely alter the results\nand is therefore of secondary importance. Although a static network description\nyields useful results, the temporal resolution of data plays an outstanding\nrole for an in-depth understanding of spreading processes. This applies in\nparticular for an accurate calculation of the maximum outbreak size.\n", "  We study the thermo-magnetic properties of the strong coupling constant G and\nquark mass M entering the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model. For this purpose, we\ncompute the quark condensate and compare it to lattice QCD (LQCD) results to\nextract the behavior of G and M as functions of the magnetic field strength and\ntemperature. We find that at zero temperature, where the LQCD condensate is\nfound to monotonically increase with the field strength, M also increases\nwhereas G remains approximately constant. However, for temperatures above the\nchiral/deconfinement phase transitions, where the LQCD condensate is found to\nmonotonically decrease with increasing field, M and G also decrease\nmonotonically. For finite temperatures, below the transition temperature, we\nfind that both G and M initially grow and then decrease with increasing field\nstrength. To study possible consequences of the extracted temperature and\nmagnetic field dependence of G and M, we compute the pressure and compare to\nLQCD results, finding an excellent qualitative agreement. In particular, we\nshow that the transverse pressure, as a function of the field strength, is\nalways negative for temperatures below the transition temperature whereas it\nstarts off being positive and then becomes negative for temperatures above the\ntransition temperature, also in agreement with LQCD results. We also show that\nfor the longitudinal pressure to agree with LQCD calculations, the system\nshould be described as a diamagnet. We argue that the turnover of M and G as\nfunctions of temperature and field strength is a key element that drives the\nbehavior of the quark condensate going across the transition temperature and\nprovides clues for a better understanding of the inverse magnetic catalysis\nphenomenon.\n", "  The local segmental and global dynamics of a series of polypropylene glycol /\nsilica nanocomposites were studied using rheometry and mechanical and\ndielectric spectroscopies. The particles cause substantial changes in the\nrheology, including higher viscosities that become non-Newtonian and the\nappearance of stress overshoots in the transient shear viscosity. However, no\nchange was observed in the mean relaxation times for either the segmental or\nnormal mode dynamics measured dielectrically. This absence of an effect of the\nparticles is due to masking of the interfacial response by polymer chains\nremote from the particles. When the unattached polymer was extracted to isolate\nthe interfacial material, very large reductions in the relaxation times were\nmeasured. This speeding up of the dynamics is due in part to the reduced\ndensity at the interface, presumably a consequence of poorer packing of\ntethered chains. In addition, binding of the ether oxygens of the polypropylene\nglycol chains truncates the normal mode, which shifts the corresponding\nrelaxation peak to higher frequencies.\n", "  We introduce a method for a combined calculation of charge and vector spin\ntransport of elastically tunneling electrons in magnetic scanning tunneling\nmicroscopy (STM). The method is based on the three-dimensional\nWentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (3D-WKB) approach combined with electronic structure\ncalculations using first principles density functional theory. As an\napplication, we analyze the STM contrast inversion of the charge current above\nthe Fe/W(110) surface depending on the bias voltage, tip-sample distance and\nrelative magnetization orientation between the sample and an iron tip. For the\nspin transfer torque (STT) vector we find that its in-plane component is\ngenerally larger than the out-of-plane component, and we identify a\nlongitudinal spin current component, which, however, does not contribute to the\ntorque. Our results suggest that the torque-current relationship in magnetic\nSTM junctions follows the power law rather than a linear function.\nConsequently, we show that the ratio between the STT and the spin-polarized\ncharge current is not constant, and more importantly, it can be tuned by the\nbias voltage, tip-sample distance and magnetization rotation. We find that the\nSTT efficiency can be enhanced by about a factor of seven by selecting a proper\nbias voltage. Thus, we demonstrate the possible enhancement of the STT\nefficiency in magnetic STM junctions, which can be exploited in technological\napplications. We discuss our results in view of the indirect measurement of the\nSTT above the Fe/W(110) surface reported by Krause et al. in Phys. Rev. Lett.\n107, 186601 (2011).\n", "  We present hydrodynamic simulations of the common envelope binary interaction\nbetween a giant star and a compact companion carried out with the adaptive mesh\nrefinement code ENZO and the smooth particle hydrodynamics code PHANTOM. These\nsimulations mimic the parameters of one of the simulations by Passy et al., but\nassess the impact of a larger, more realistic initial orbital separation on the\nsimulation outcome. We conclude that for both codes the post-common envelope\nseparation is somewhat larger and the amount of unbound mass slightly greater\nwhen the initial separation is wide enough that the giant does not yet overflow\nor just overflows its Roche lobe. PHANTOM has been adapted to the common\nenvelope problem here for the first time and a full comparison with ENZO is\npresented, including an investigation of convergence as well as energy and\nangular momentum conservation. We also set our simulations in the context of\npast simulations. This comparison reveals that it is the expansion of the giant\nbefore rapid in-spiral and not spinning up of the star that causes a larger\nfinal separation. We also suggest that the large range in unbound mass for\ndifferent simulations is difficult to explain and may have something to do with\nsimulations that are not fully converged.\n", "  A Bose-Einstein condensate is used as an atomic source for a high precision\nsensor. A $5\\times 10^6$ atom F=1 spinor condensate of $^{87}$Rb is released\ninto free fall for up to $750$ms and probed with a Mach-Zehnder atom\ninterferometer based on Bragg transitions. The Bragg interferometer\nsimultaneously addresses the three magnetic states, $\\left| m_f=1,0,-1\n\\right\\rangle$, facilitating a simultaneous measurement of the acceleration due\nto gravity with an asymptotic precision of $2.1\\times 10^{-9}$$\\Delta$g/g and\nthe magnetic field gradient to a precision $8$pT/m.\n", "  Non-standard neutrino interactions (NSIs), the sub-leading effects in the\nflavour transitions of neutrinos, play a crucial role in the determination of\nthe various unknowns in neutrino oscillations, such as neutrino mass hierarchy,\nDirac CP violating phase and the octant of atmospheric mixing angle. In this\nwork, we focus on the possible implications of lepton flavour violating (LFV)\nNSIs, which generally affect the neutrino propagation, on the determination of\nthe these unknown oscillation parameters. We study the effect of these NSIs on\nthe physics potential of the currently running and upcoming long-baseline\nexperiments, i.e., T2K, NO$\\nu$A and DUNE. We also check the allowed\noscillation parameter space in presence of LFV NSIs.\n", "  In this paper we propose the first estimate of some elastic parameters of the\nrelaxed micromorphic model on the basis of real experiments of transmission of\nlongitudinal plane waves across an interface separating a classical Cauchy\nmaterial (steel plate) and a phononic crystal (steel plate with fluid-filled\nholes). A procedure is set up in order to identify the parameters of our model\nby superimposing the experimentally-based profile of the reflection coefficient\n(plotted as function of the frequency of the traveling waves) with the\nanalogous profile obtained via simulations based upon the relaxed micromorphic\nmodel. We end up with the determination of 5 out of 6 constitutive parameters\nwhich are featured by the relaxed micromorphic model in the isotropic case,\nplus the determination of the micro-inertia parameter. The sixth elastic\nparameter, namely the Cosserat couple modulus $\\mu_{c}$, still remains\nundetermined, since experimental data concerning the transmission properties of\nthe considered interface for transverse incident waves are not yet available. A\nfundamental result of the present paper is the estimate of the non-locality\nintrinsically associated to the underlying microstructure of the metamaterial.\nAs a matter of fact, we appraise that the characteristic length $L_{c}$\nmeasuring the non-locality of the considered phononic crystal is of the order\nof $1/3$ of the diameter of the considered fluid-filled holes.\n", "  This work studies the motion of Purcell's three-link microswimmer in viscous\nflow, by using perturbation expansion of its dynamics under small-amplitude\nstrokes. Leading-order expressions and next-order correction terms for the\ndisplacement of the swimmer are obtained for the cases of a square or circular\ngait in the plane of joint angles. The correction terms demonstrate the\nreversal in movement direction for large stroke amplitudes, which has\npreviously only been shown numerically. In addition, asymptotic expressions for\nLighthill's energetic efficiency are obtained for both gaits. These\napproximations enable calculating optimal stroke amplitudes and swimmer's\ngeometry (i.e. ratio of links' lengths) for maximizing either the displacement\nor Lighthill's efficiency.\n", "  We review recent work that employs the framework of logical inference to\nestablish a bridge between data gathered through experiments and their\nobjective description in terms of human-made concepts. It is shown that logical\ninference applied to experiments for which the observed events are independent\nand for which the frequency distribution of these events is robust with respect\nto small changes of the conditions under which experiments are carried out\nyields, without introducing any concept of quantum theory, the quantum\ntheoretical description in terms of the Schr\\\"odinger or the Pauli equation,\nthe Stern-Gerlach or Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen-Bohm experiments. The\nextraordinary descriptive power of quantum theory then follows from the fact\nthat it is plausible reasoning, that is common sense, applied to reproducible\nand robust experimental data.\n", "  In this article we present an analytical two-component model for pulsar\nrotational dynamics. Under the assumption of axial symmetry, implemented by a\nparaxial array of straight vortices that thread the entire neutron superfluid,\nwe are able to project exactly the 3D hydrodynamical problem to a 1D\ncylindrical one. In the presence of density dependent entrainment the\nsuperfluid rotation is non-columnar: we circumvent this by using an auxiliary\ndynamical variable directly related to the areal density of vortices. The main\nresult is a system of differential equations that take consistently into\naccount the stratified spherical structure of the star, the dynamical effects\nof non-uniform entrainment, the differential rotation of the superfluid\ncomponent and its coupling to the normal crust. These equations represent a\nmathematical framework in which to test quantitatively the macroscopic\nconsequences of the presence of a stable vortex array, a working hypothesis\nwidely used in glitch models. Even without solving the equations explicitly, we\nare able to draw some general quantitative conclusions; in particular, we show\nthat the reservoir of angular momentum (corresponding to recent values of the\npinning forces) is enough to reproduce the largest glitch observed in the Vela\npulsar, provided its mass is not too large.\n", "  We report the discovery of two transiting extrasolar planets from the\nHATSouth survey. HATS-11, a V=14.1 G0-star shows a periodic 12.9 mmag dip in\nits light curve every 3.6192 days and a radial velocity variation consistent\nwith a Keplerian orbit. HATS-11 has a mass of 1.000 $\\pm$ 0.060 M$_{\\odot}$, a\nradius of 1.444 $\\pm$ 0.057 M$_{\\odot}$ and an effective temperature of 6060\n$\\pm$ 150 K, while its companion is a 0.85 $\\pm$ 0.12 M$_J$, 1.510 $\\pm$ 0.078\nR$_J$ planet in a circular orbit. HATS-12 shows a periodic 5.1 mmag flux\ndecrease every 3.1428 days and Keplerian RV variations around a V=12.8 F-star.\nHATS-12 has a mass of 1.489 $\\pm$ 0.071 M$_{\\odot}$, a radius of 2.21 $\\pm$\n0.21 R$_{\\odot}$, and an effective temperature of 6408 $\\pm$ 75 K. For HATS-12,\nour measurements indicate that this is a 2.38 $\\pm$ 0.11 M$_J$, 1.35 $\\pm$ 0.17\nR$_J$ planet in a circular orbit. Both host stars show sub-solar metallicity of\n-0.390 $\\pm$ 0.060 dex and -0.100 $\\pm$ 0.040 dex, respectively and are\n(slightly) evolved stars. In fact, HATS-11 is amongst the most metal-poor and,\nHATS-12 is amongst the most evolved stars hosting a hot Jupiter planet.\nImportantly, HATS-11 and HATS-12 have been observed in long cadence by Kepler\nas part of K2 campaign 7 (EPIC216414930 and EPIC218131080 respectively).\n", "  Shape memory alloys are a class of ferroic materials which undergo a\nstructural (martensitic) transition where the associated ferroic property is a\nlattice distortion (strain). The sensitiveness of the transition to the\nconjugated external field (stress), together with the latent heat of the\ntransition gives rise to giant mechanocaloric effects. In non-magnetic shape\nmemory alloys, the lattice distortion is mostly described by a pure shear and\nthe martensitic transition in this family of alloys is strongly affected by\nuniaxial stress whereas it is basically insensitive to hydrostatic pressure. As\na result, non-magnetic alloys exhibit giant elastocaloric effects but\nnegligible barocaloric effects. By contrast, in a number of magnetic shape\nmemory alloys, the lattice distortion at the martensitic transition involves a\nvolume change in addition to the shear strain. Those alloys are affected by\nboth uniaxial stress and hydrostatic pressure and they exhibit giant\nelastocaloric and barocaloric effects. The paper aims at providing a critical\nsurvey of available experimental data on elastocaloric and barocaloric effects\nin magnetic and non-magnetic shape memory alloys.\n", "  We describe the mathematical underpinnings of the biorthogonal von Neumann\nmethod for quantum mechanical simulations (PvB). In particular, we present a\ndetailed discussion of the important issue of non-orthogonal projection onto\nsubspaces of biorthogonal bases, and how this differs from orthogonal\nprojection. We present various representations of the Schr\\\"odinger equation in\nthe reduced basis and discuss their relative merits. We conclude with\nillustrative examples and a discussion of the outlook and challenges ahead for\nthe PvB representation.\n", "  We consider the fate of a helical edge state of a spin Hall insulator and its\ntopological transition in presence of a circularly polarized light when coupled\nto various forms of environments. A Lindblad type equation is developed to\ndetermine the fermion occupation of the Floquet bands. We find by using\nanalytical and numerical methods that non-secular terms, corresponding to\n2-photon transitions, lead to a mixing of the band occupations, hence the light\ninduced photocurrent is in general not perfectly quantized in the presence of\nfinite coupling to the environment, although deviations are small in the\nadiabatic limit. Sharp crossovers are identified at frequencies $\\Omega$ and\n$\\frac{1}{2}\\Omega$ ($\\Omega$ is the strength of light-matter coupling) with\nthe former resembling to a phase transition.\n", "  We revisit the existing limits on the gaugino masses in various\nSupersymmetric (SUSY) scenarios derived from Run-I data of the LHC. These\nlimits obtained from the various final states rely heavily on the simplified\nassumptions regarding the masses, compositions and decay branching ratios of\nthe gauginos. The most promising exclusion limits on the gaugino masses are\nobtained from trilepton final states while the second lightest neutralino\n($\\widetilde \\chi_2^0$) decaying into the SM-like Higgs and lightest SUSY\nparticle (LSP) results in the weakest bounds. Our aim is to assess the extent\nof deviation of these exclusion limits in more realistic scenarios. After a\nbrief discussion on the various decay modes of the $\\widetilde \\chi_2^0$ and\nthe lightest chargino ($\\widetilde \\chi^{\\pm}_1$), we proceed to validate the\nATLAS exclusion limits obtained from trilepton, $l\\gamma\\gamma$ and $lb\\bar b$\nfinal states associated with missing energy. We then consider different\ncombinations of the relevant branching ratios to study their impact on the\nexisting bounds. The results are presented alongside the existing exclusion\nlimits to showcase the extent of the obtained deviation. We also observe that\nthe three-body decay modes of $\\widetilde \\chi_2^0$ and $\\widetilde\n\\chi^{\\pm}_1$ via off-shell slepton decays resulting in trilepton final states\nprovide bounds that are far more severe in some parts of the available\nparameter space than that obtained from the usual two-body decay modes of the\naforementioned gauginos.\n", "  We show that a volatile liquid drop placed at the surface of a non-volatile\nliquid pool warmer than the boiling point of the drop can experience a\nLeidenfrost effect even for vanishingly small superheats. Such an observation\npoints to the importance of the substrate roughness, negligible in the case\nconsidered here, in determining the threshold Leidenfrost temperature. A\ntheoretical model based on the one proposed by Sobac et al. [Phys. Rev. E 90,\n053011 (2014)] is developed in order to rationalize the experimental data. The\nshapes of the drop and of the substrate are analyzed. The model notably\nprovides scalings for the vapor film thickness. For small drops, these scalings\nappear to be identical to the case of a Leidenfrost drop on a solid substrate.\nFor large drops, in contrast, they are different and no evidence of chimney\nformation has been observed either experimentally or theoretically in the range\nof drop sizes considered in this study. Concerning the evaporation dynamics,\nthe radius is shown to decrease linearly with time whatever the drop size,\nwhich differs from the case of a Leidenfrost drop on a solid substrate. For\nhigh superheats, the characteristic lifetime of the drops versus the superheat\nfollows a scaling law that is derived from the model but, at low superheats, it\ndeviates from this scaling by rather saturating.\n", "  A comparative study on mesh-based and mesh-less Computational Fluid Dynamics\n(CFD) approaches coupled with the Discrete Element Method (DEM) is presented.\nAs the mesh-based CFD approach a Finite Volume Method (FVM) is used. A Smoothed\nParticle Hydrodynamics (SPH) method represents mesh-less CFD. The unresolved\nfluid model is governed by the locally averaged Navier-Stokes equations. A\nnewly developed model for applying boundary conditions in the SPH is described\nand validation tests are performed. With the help of the presented comparative\ntests, the similarities and differences of DEM-FVM and DEM-SPH methods are\ndiscussed. Three test cases, comprised of a single solid particle sedimentation\ntest, flow through a porous block and sedimentation of a porous block, are\nperformed using both methods. Drag forces acting on solid particles highly\ndepend on local fluid fractions. For comparative reasons, the size of a cell in\nFVM is chosen such that fluid fractions match those computed in SPH. In\ngeneral, DEM-FVM and DEM-SPH methods exhibit good agreement with analytic\nreference results. Differences between DEM-SPH and DEM-FVM approaches were\nfound mostly due to differences in computed local fluid fractions.\n", "  We construct a model to study the localization properties of nanowires of\ndopants in silicon (Si) fabricated by precise ionic implantation or STM\nlithography. Experiments have shown that Ohm's law holds in some cases, in\napparent defiance to the Anderson localization theory in one dimension. We\ninvestigate how valley interference affects the traditional theory of\nelectronic structure of disordered systems. Each isolated donor orbital is\nrealistically described by multi-valley effective mass theory (MV-EMT). We\nextend this model to describe chains of donors as a linear combination of\ndopant orbitals. Disorder in donor positioning is taken into account, leading\nto an intricate disorder distribution of hoppings between nearest neighbor\ndonor sites (donor-donor tunnel coupling) -- an effect of valley interference.\nThe localization length is obtained for phosphorous (P) donor chains from a\ntransfer matrix approach and is further compared with the chain length. We\nquantitatively determine the impact of uncertainties $\\delta R$ in the\nimplantation position relative to a target and also compare our results with\nthose obtained without valley interference. We analyse systematically the aimed\ninter-donor separation dependence ($R_0$) and show that fairly diluted donor\nchains ($R_0=7.7$ nm) may be as long as 100 nm before the effective onset of\nAnderson localization, as long as the positioning error is under a lattice\nparameter ($\\delta R <0.543$ nm).\n", "  We obtain higher dimensional solutions for super compact star for the\nBuchdahl-Vaidya-Tikekar metric ansatz. In particular, Vaidya and Tikekar\ncharacterized the $3$-geometry by a parameter, $K$ which is related to the sign\nof density gradient. It turns out that the key pressure isotropy equation\ncontinues to have the same Gauss form, and hence $4$-dimensional solutions can\nbe taken over to higher dimensions with $K$ satisfying the relation, $K_n =\n(K_4-n+4)/(n-3)$ where subscript refers to dimension of spacetime. Further\n$K\\geq0$ is required else density would have undesirable feature of increasing\nwith radius, and the equality indicates a constant density star described by\nthe Schwarzschild interior solution. This means for a given $K_4$, maximum\ndimension could only be $n=K_4+4$, else $K_n$ will turn negative.\n", "  We investigate the effects of the relativistic movement of an optical medium\non the conditions of constructive and destructive interference, reflection and\ntransmission pattern, and performance of spectroscopes. First, we consider the\ncase of two beams reflected from a relativistically moving thin film and derive\nthe conditions of constructive and destructive interference. Then we broaden\nthe idea to multiple beam interference and formulate a new modified equation of\nreflection and transmission pattern of light from a relativistically moving\nplane parallel dielectric film. Finally, we determine the new effective\nresolving power of a Fabry-Perot spectroscope, which has a moving dielectric\nmedium in its etalon. Here, we consider the case where the optical media move\nparallel to the plane of incidence of light. Throughout this paper, we use\nbasic Lorentz transformation of space and time co-ordinates and electromagnetic\nfields to conduct these investigations. This paper can strongly motivate\nundergraduate physics students to associate the concepts of special relativity\nand optical interference.\n", "  As a granular material is compressed, the particles and forces within the\nsystem arrange to form complex heterogeneous structures. Force chains are a\nprime example and are thought to constrain bulk properties such as mechanical\nstability and acoustic transmission. However, characterizing the dynamic nature\nof mesoscale architectures in granular systems can be challenging. A growing\nbody of work has shown that graph theoretic approaches may provide a useful\nfoundation for tackling these problems. Here, we extend current approaches by\nutilizing multilayer networks as a framework for directly quantifying the\nevolution of mesoscale architecture in a compressed granular system. We examine\na quasi-two-dimensional aggregate of photoelastic disks, subject to biaxial\ncompression through a series of small, quasistatic steps. Treating particles as\nnetwork nodes and inter-particle forces as network edges, we construct a\nmultilayer network by linking together the series of static force networks that\nexist at each strain step. We then extract the inherent mesoscale structure\nfrom the system by using a generalization of community detection methods, and\nwe define quantitative measures to characterize the reconfiguration and\nevolution of this structure throughout compression. By separately considering\nthe network of normal and tangential forces, we find that they display\ndifferent structural evolution. To test the sensitivity of the network model to\nparticle properties, we examine whether the method can distinguish a subsystem\nof low-friction particles within a bath of higher-friction particles. We find\nthat this can be done by considering the network of tangential forces. The\nresults discussed throughout this study suggest that these novel network\nscience techniques may provide a direct way to compare and classify data from\nsystems under different external conditions or with different physical makeup.\n", "  Very recently Spitler et al. (2016) and Scholz et al. (2016) reported their\ndetections of sixteen additional bright bursts from the direction of the fast\nradio burst (FRB) 121102. This repeating FRB is inconsistent with all the\ncatastrophic event models put forward previously for hypothetically\nnon-repeating FRBs. Here we propose a different model, in which highly\nmagnetized pulsars travel through asteroid belts of other stars. We show that a\nrepeating FRB could originate from such a pulsar encountering lots of asteroids\nin the belt. During each pulsar-asteroid impact, an electric field induced\noutside the asteroid has such a large component parallel to the stellar\nmagnetic field that electrons are torn off the asteroidal surface and\naccelerated to ultra-relativistic energies instantaneously. Subsequent movement\nof these electrons along magnetic field lines will cause coherent curvature\nradiation, which can account for all the properties of an FRB. In addition,\nthis model can self-consistently explain the typical duration, luminosity, and\nrepetitive rate of the seventeen bursts of FRB 121102. The predicted occurrence\nrate of repeating FRB sources may imply that our model would be testable in the\nnext few years.\n", "  To increase public awareness of theoretical materials physics, a small group\nof high school students is invited to participate actively in a current\nresearch projects at Chalmers University of Technology. The Chalmers research\ngroup explores methods for filtrating hazardous and otherwise unwanted\nmolecules from drinking water, for example by adsorption in active carbon\nfilters. In this project, the students use graphene as an idealized model for\nactive carbon, and estimate the energy of adsorption of the methylbenzene\ntoluene on graphene with the help of the atomic-scale calculational method\ndensity functional theory. In this process the students develop an insight into\napplied quantum physics, a topic usually not taught at this educational level,\nand gain some experience with a couple of state-of-the-art calculational tools\nin materials research.\n", "  Rooted connected chord diagrams form a nice class of combinatorial objects.\nRecently they were shown to index solutions to certain Dyson-Schwinger\nequations in quantum field theory. Key to this indexing role are certain\nspecial chords which are called terminal chords. Terminal chords provide a\nnumber of combinatorially interesting parameters on rooted connected chord\ndiagrams which have not been studied previously. Understanding these parameters\nbetter has implications for quantum field theory.\n  Specifically, we show that the distributions of the number of terminal chords\nand the number of adjacent terminal chords are asymptotically Gaussian with\nlogarithmic means, and we prove that the average index of the first terminal\nchord is $2n/3$. Furthermore, we obtain a method to determine any next-to${}^i$\nleading log expansion of the solution to these Dyson-Schwinger equations, and\nhave asymptotic information about the coefficients of the log expansions.\n", "  A feedback vertex set (FVS) of an undirected graph contains vertices from\nevery cycle of this graph. Constructing a FVS of sufficiently small cardinality\nis very difficult in the worst cases, but for random graphs this problem can be\nefficiently solved after converting it into an appropriate spin glass model\n[H.-J. Zhou, Eur. Phys. J. B 86 (2013) 455]. In the present work we study the\nlocal stability and the phase transition properties of this spin glass model on\nrandom graphs. For both regular random graphs and Erd\\\"os-R\\'enyi graphs we\ndetermine the inverse temperature $\\beta_l$ at which the replica-symmetric mean\nfield theory loses its local stability, the inverse temperature $\\beta_d$ of\nthe dynamical (clustering) phase transition, and the inverse temperature\n$\\beta_c$ of the static (condensation) phase transition. We find that\n$\\beta_{l}$, $\\beta_{d}$, and $\\beta_c$ change with the (mean) vertex degree in\na non-monotonic way; $\\beta_d$ is distinct from $\\beta_c$ for regular random\ngraphs of vertex degrees $K\\geq 64$, while $\\beta_d$ are always identical to\n$\\beta_c$ for Erd\\\"os-R\\'enyi graphs (at least up to mean vertex degree\n$c=512$). We also compute the minimum FVS size of regular random graphs through\nthe zero-temperature first-step replica-symmetry-breaking mean field theory and\nreach good agreement with the results obtained on single graph instances by the\nbelief propagation-guided decimation algorithm. Taking together, this paper\npresents a systematic theoretical study on the energy landscape property of a\nspin glass system with global cycle constraints.\n", "  In this paper we consider a particular version of the random walk with\nrestarts: random reset events which bring suddenly the system to the starting\nvalue. We analyze its relevant statistical properties like the transition\nprobability and show how an equilibrium state appears. Formulas for the\nfirst-passage time, high-water marks and other extreme statistics are also\nderived: we consider counting problems associated naturally to the system.\nFinally we indicate feasible generalizations useful for interpreting different\nphysical effects.\n", "  We report on the elastic contact between a spherical lens and a patterned\nsubstrate, composed of an hexagonal lattice of cylindrical pillars. The stress\nfield and the size of the contact area are obtained by means of numerical\nmethods (discrete Green's function superposition and iterative bisection-like\nmethods). For small indentations, a transition from a Hertzian to a\nBoussinesq-Cerruti-like behavior is observed when the surface fraction of the\nsubstrate that is covered by pillars is increased. In particular, we present a\nmaster curve defined by two dimensionless parameters, which allows to predict\nthe stress at the center of contact region in terms of the surface fraction\noccupied by pillars. The transition between the limiting contact regimes,\nHertzian and Boussinesq-Cerruti-like, is well described by a rational function.\nAdditionally, a simple model to describe the Boussines-Cerruti-like contact\nbetween the lens and a single elastic pillar, which takes into account the\npillar geometry and the elastic properties of the two bodies, is presented.\n", "  We derive the field equations for topologically massive gravity coupled with\nthe most general quadratic curvature terms using the language of exterior\ndifferential forms and a first order constrained variational principle. We find\nvariational field equations both in the presence and absence of torsion. We\nthen show that spaces of constant negative curvature (i.e. the anti de-Sitter\nspace $AdS_3$) and constant torsion provide exact solutions.\n", "  We report on electron momentum distributions from single ionization of Ar in\nstrong orthogonally polarized two-color (OTC) laser fields measured with the\nCOLTRIMS technique. We study the effect of Coulomb focusing whose signature is\na cusp like feature in the center of the electron momentum spectrum. While the\ndirect electrons show the expected strong dependence on the phase between the\ntwo colors, surprisingly the Coulomb focused structure is almost not influenced\nby the weak second harmonic streaking field. This effect is explained by the\nuse of a CTMC simulation which describes the tunneled electron wave packet in\nterms of classical trajectories under the influence of the combined Coulomb-\nand OTC laser field. We find a subtle interplay between the initial momentum of\nthe electron upon tunneling, the ionization phase and the action of the Coulomb\nfield that makes the Coulomb focused part of the momentum spectrum apparently\ninsensitive to the weaker streaking field.\n", "  Modellers of complex biological or social systems are often faced with an\ninvidious choice: to use simple models with few mechanisms that can be fully\nanalysed, or to construct complicated models that include all the features\nwhich are thought relevant. The former ensures rigour, the latter relevance. We\ndiscuss a method that combines these two approaches, beginning with a complex\nmodel and then modelling the complicated model with simpler models. The\nresulting \"chain\" of models ensures some rigour and relevance. We illustrate\nthis process on a complex model of voting intentions, constructing a reduced\nmodel which agrees well with the predictions of the full model. Experiments\nwith variations of the simpler model yield additional insights which are hidden\nby the complexity of the full model. This approach facilitated collaboration\nbetween social scientists and physicists -- the complex model was specified\nbased on the social science literature, and the simpler model constrained to\nagree (in core aspects) with the complicated model.\n", "  We present the first materials specific ab initio theory of the magnetization\ninduced by circularly polarized laser light in metals. Our calculations are\nbased on non-linear density matrix theory and include the effect of absorption.\nWe show that the induced magnetization, commonly referred to as inverse Faraday\neffect, is strongly materials and frequency dependent, and demonstrate the\nexistence of both spin and orbital induced magnetizations which exhibit a\nsurprisingly different behavior. We show that for nonmagnetic metals (as Cu,\nAu, Pd, Pt) and antiferromagnetic metals the induced magnetization is\nantisymmetric in the light's helicity, whereas for ferromagnetic metals (Fe,\nCo, Ni, FePt) the imparted magnetization is only asymmetric in the helicity. We\ncompute effective optomagnetic fields that correspond to the induced\nmagnetizations and provide guidelines for achieving all-optical\nhelicity-dependent switching.\n", "  Decisions taken in our everyday lives are based on a wide variety of\ninformation so it is generally very difficult to assess what are the strategies\nthat guide us. Stock market therefore provides a rich environment to study how\npeople take decision since responding to market uncertainty needs a constant\nupdate of these strategies. For this purpose, we run a lab-in-the-field\nexperiment where volunteers are given a controlled set of financial information\n-based on real data from worldwide financial indices- and they are required to\nguess whether the market price would go up or down in each situation. From the\ndata collected we explore basic statistical traits, behavioural biases and\nemerging strategies. In particular, we detect unintended patterns of behavior\nthrough consistent actions which can be interpreted as {\\it Market Imitation}\nand {\\it Win-Stay Lose-Shift} emerging strategies, being {\\it Market Imitation}\nthe most dominant one. We also observe that these strategies are affected by\nexternal factors: the expert advice, the lack of information or an information\noverload reinforce the use of these intuitive strategies, while the probability\nto follow them significantly decreases when subjects spends more time to take a\ndecision. The cohort analysis shows that women and children are more prone to\nuse such strategies although their performance is not undermined. Our results\nare of interest for better handling clients expectations of trading companies,\navoiding behavioural anomalies in financial analysts decisions and improving\nnot only the design of markets but also the trading digital interfaces where\ninformation is set down. Strategies and behavioural biases observed can also be\ntranslated into new agent based modelling or stochastic price dynamics to\nbetter understand financial bubbles or the effects of asymmetric risk\nperception to price drops.\n", "  We present an observation of zero to $\\pi$ phase flips induced by Rabi\noscillation in an unbalanced Ramsey atom interferometer. The phase shift and\nvisibility are experimentally investigated by modulating either the\npolarization or duration of Raman lasers, and they are well explained by a\ntheoretical model. In an atom interferometer, the $\\pi$-phase flips are caused\nnot only by the sign of Rabi frequency but also by the Rabi oscillation.\nConsidering the $\\pi$-phase flips, we propose the composite-light-pulse\nsequences for realizing the large-momentum-transfer beam splitter and mirror,\nwhich have the high immunity to the external phase noise in building the cold\natom interferometer.\n", "  We present a strong-coupling approach to the theory of high-temperature\nsuperconductivity based on the observation of a quantum critical point in the\nplaquette within the t,t' Hubbard model. The crossing of ground state energies\nin the N=2,3,4 sectors occurs for parameters close to the optimal doping. The\ntheory predicts the maximum of the d(x2-y2)-wave order parameter at the border\nbetween localized and itinerant electron behavior and gives a natural\nexplanation for the pseudo-gap formation via soft-fermion mode related to local\nsinglet states of the plaquette in the environment. Our approach follows the\ngeneral line of resonating valence bond theory stressing a crucial role of\nsinglets in the physics of high-Tc superconductors, but focuses on the\nformation of local singlets, similar to phenomena observed in frustrated\none-dimensional quantum spin models.\n", "  Isotropic gases irradiated by long pulses of intense IR light can generate\nvery high harmonics of the incident field. It is generally accepted that, due\nto the symmetry of the generating medium, be it an atomic or an isotropic\nmolecular gas, only odd harmonics of the driving field can be produced. Here we\nshow how the interplay of electronic and nuclear dynamics can lead to a marked\nbreakdown of this standard picture: a substantial part of the harmonic spectrum\ncan consist of even rather than odd harmonics. We demonstrate the effect using\nab-initio solutions of the time-dependent Schr\\\"odinger equation for\n$H$$_2$$^+$ and its isotopes in full dimensionality. By means of a simple\nanalytical model, we identify its physical origin, which is the appearance of a\npermanent dipole moment in dissociating homonuclear molecules, caused by\nlight-induced localization of the electric charge during dissociation. The\neffect arises for sufficiently long laser pulses and the region of the spectrum\nwhere even harmonics are produced is controlled by pulse duration. Our results\n(i) show how the interplay of femtosecond nuclear and attosecond electronic\ndynamics, which affects the charge flow inside the dissociating molecule, is\nreflected in the nonlinear response, and (ii) force one to augment standard\nselection rules found in nonlinear optics textbooks by considering\nlight-induced modifications of the medium during the generation process.\n", "  Regular arrays of magnetic atoms on a superconductor provide a promising\nplatform for topological superconductivity. In this work we study effects of\ndisorder in these systems, focusing on vacancies realized by missing magnetic\natoms. We develop approaches that allow treatment of ferromagnetic dense chains\nas well as long-range hopping ferromagnetic and helical Shiba chains at\narbitrary subgap energies. Vacancies in magnetic chains play an analogous role\nto magnetic impurities in a clean $s$-wave superconductor. A single vacancy in\na topological chain gives rise to a low-lying \"anti-Shiba\" state below the band\nedge of a regular magnetic chain. Proliferation of the anti-Shiba band formed\nby a finite density of hybridized vacancy states leads to deterioration of the\ntopological phase, which exhibits unusual fragility in a particular parameter\nregion in dilute chains. We also consider local fluctuation in the Shiba\ncoupling and discuss how vacancy states could contribute to experimental\nverification of topological superconductivity.\n", "  We explore dynamics of discrete breathers and multi-breathers in finite\none-dimensional chain. The model involves parabolic on-site potential with\nrigid constraints and linear nearest-neighbor coupling. The rigid non-ideal\nimpact constraints are the only source of nonlinearity and damping in the\nmodel. The model allows derivation of exact analytic solutions for the\nbreathers and multi-breathers with arbitrary set of localization sites, both in\nconservative and forced-damped settings. We choose periodic boundary\nconditions; exact solutions for other types of the boundary conditions are also\npossible. Local character of the nonlinearity allows explicit derivation of a\nmonodromy matrix for the breather solutions. Consequently, a stability of the\nderived breather and multi-breather solutions can be efficiently studied in the\nframework of simple methods of linear algebra, and with rather moderate\ncomputational efforts. We demonstrate that finitness of the chain fragment and\nproximity of the localization sites strongly effect existence and stability\npatterns of these localized solutions.\n", "  The simultaneous quantum estimation of multiple parameters can provide a\nbetter precision than estimating them individually. This is an effect that is\nimpossible classically. We review the rich background of multi-parameter\nquantum metrology, some of the main results in the field and its recent\nadvances. We close by highlighting future challenges and open questions.\n", "  On social media algorithms for content promotion, accounting for users\npreferences, might limit the exposure to unsolicited contents. In this work, we\nstudy how the same contents (videos) are consumed on different platforms --\ni.e. Facebook and YouTube -- over a sample of $12M$ of users. Our findings show\nthat the same content lead to the formation of echo chambers, irrespective of\nthe online social network and thus of the algorithm for content promotion.\nFinally, we show that the users' commenting patterns are accurate early\npredictors for the formation of echo-chambers.\n", "  The modern optical telescopes produce a huge number of asteroid observations,\nthat are grouped into very short arcs (VSAs), each containing a few\nobservations of the same object in one single night. To decide whether two\nVSAs, collected in different nights, refer to the same observed object we can\nattempt to compute an orbit with the observations of both arcs: this is called\nthe linkage problem. Since the number of orbit computations to be performed is\nvery large, we need efficient methods of orbit determination. Using the first\nintegrals of Kepler's motion we can write algebraic equations for the linkage\nproblem, which can be put in polynomial form. The equations introduced in\n(Gronchi et al. 2015) can be reduced to a univariate polynomial of degree 9:\nthe unknown is the topocentric distance $\\rho$ of the observed body at the mean\nepoch of one of the VSAs. Using elimination theory we show an optimal property\nof this polynomial: it has the least degree among the univariate polynomials in\nthe same variable that are consequence of the algebraic conservation laws and\nare obtained without squaring operations, that can be used to bring these\nalgebraic equations in polynomial form. In this paper we also introduce a\nprocedure to join three VSAs belonging to different nights: from the\nconservation of angular momentum at the three mean epochs of the VSAs, we\nobtain a univariate polynomial equation of degree 8 in the topocentric distance\n$\\rho_2$ at the intermediate epoch. This algorithm has the same computational\ncomplexity as the classical method by Gauss, but uses more information,\ntherefore we expect that it can produce more accurate results. For both\nmethods, linking two and three VSAs, we also discuss how to select the\nsolutions, making use of the full two-body dynamics, and show some numerical\ntests comparing the results with the ones obtained by Gauss' method.\n", "  We present a catalogue including 11,204 spectra for 10,436 early-type\nemission-line stars from LAMOST DR2, among which 9,752 early-type emission-line\nspectra are newly discovered. For these early-type emission-line stars, we\ndiscuss the morphological and physical properties from their low-resolution\nspectra. In this spectral sample, the H$\\alpha$ emission profiles display a\nwide variety of shapes. Based on the H$\\alpha$ line profiles, these spectra are\ncategorized into five distinct classes: single-peak emission, single-peak\nemission in absorption, double-peak emission, double-peak emission in\nabsorption, and P-Cygni profiles. To better understand what causes the\nH$\\alpha$ line profiles, we divide these objects into four types from the view\nof physical classification, which include classical Be stars, Herbig Ae/Be\nstars, close binaries and spectra contaminated by HII regions. The majority of\nHerbig Ae/Be stars and classical Be stars are identified and separated using\nthe (H-K, K-W1) color-color diagram. We also discuss thirty one binary systems\nas listed in SIMBAD on-line catalogue and identify 3,600 spectra contaminated\nby HII regions after cross matching with positions in the Dubout-Crillon\ncatalogue. A statistical analysis of line profiles versus classifications is\nthen conducted in order to understand the distribution of H$\\alpha$ profiles\nfor each type in our sample. Finally, we also provide a table of 172 spectra\nwith FeII emission lines and roughly calculate stellar wind velocities for\nseven spectra with P-Cygni profiles.\n", "  The search for weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) by direct\ndetection faces an encroaching background due to coherent neutrino-nucleus\nscattering. For a given WIMP mass the cross section at which neutrinos\nconstitute a dominant background is dependent on the uncertainty on the flux of\neach neutrino source from either the Sun, supernovae or atmospheric cosmic ray\ncollisions. However there are also considerable uncertainties with regard to\nthe astrophysical ingredients to the predicted WIMP signal. Uncertainties in\nthe velocity of the Sun with respect to the Milky Way dark matter halo, the\nlocal density of WIMPs, and the shape of the local WIMP speed distribution all\nhave an effect on the expected event rate in direct detection experiments and\nhence will change the region of the WIMP parameter space for which neutrinos\nare a significant background. In this work we extend the WIMP+neutrino analysis\nto account for the uncertainty in the astrophysics dependence of the WIMP\nsignal. We show the effect of uncertainties on projected discovery limits with\nan emphasis on low WIMP masses (less than 10 GeV) when Solar neutrino\nbackgrounds are most important. We find that accounting for astrophysical\nuncertainties changes the shape of the neutrino floor as a function of WIMP\nmass but also causes it to appear at cross sections up to an order of magnitude\nlarger, extremely close to existing experimental limits - indicating that\nneutrino backgrounds will become an issue sooner than previously thought. We\nalso explore how neutrinos hinder the estimation of WIMP parameters and how\nastrophysical uncertainties impact the discrimination of WIMPs and neutrinos\nwith the use of their respective time dependencies.\n", "  We show explicitly that massive, Abelian, vector, just like (properly\ndefined) massive tensor, fields limit smoothly to their massless, gauge,\nversions: they emit only maximal helicity radiation and mediate Coulomb and\n(special relativistic) Newtonian, forces between their (conserved) sources. Our\nmain motivation, though, is to show that the recent gravitational wave\ndetection probably cannot directly rule out very long-range gravity: Even\nthough the waves were emitted in a strong field regime, their being detected in\nthe weak field wave zone means the above equivalences apply. There remains the,\nnot unlikely, possibility that no strong field generation of radiation in\nmassive models can reproduce the observed ring-down patterns. Separately, the\nsmooth linear limiting behaviors show that the discontinuity lies not in the\nmass alone, but rather in Abelian versus non-Abelian, Yang-Mills and General\nRelativity, regimes, whose respective massive versions are known to be\nnon-physical.\n", "  We consider the phase sensing via weak optical coherent state at quantum\nlimit precision. A new detection scheme for the phase estimation is proposed\nwhich is inspired by the suboptimal quantum measurement in coherent optical\ncommunication. We theoretically analyze a performance of our detection scheme,\nwhich we call the displaced-photon counting, for phase sensing in terms of the\nFisher information and show that the displaced-photon counting outperforms the\nstatic homodyne and heterodyne detections in wide range of the target phase.\nThe proof-of-principle experiment is performed with linear optics and a\nsuperconducting nanowire single photon detector. The result shows that our\nscheme overcomes the limit of the ideal homodyne measurement even under\npractical imperfections.\n", "  The B-mode polarization of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) provides a\nunique window into tensor perturbations from inflationary gravitational waves.\nSurvey effects complicate the estimation and description of the power spectrum\non the largest angular scales. The pixel-space likelihood yields parameter\ndistributions without the power spectrum as an intermediate step, but it does\nnot have the large suite of tests available to power spectral methods. Searches\nfor primordial B-modes must rigorously reject and rule out contamination. Many\nforms of contamination vary or are uncorrelated across epochs, frequencies,\nsurveys, or other data treatment subsets. The cross power and the power\nspectrum of the difference of subset maps provide approaches to reject and\nisolate excess variance. We develop an analogous joint pixel-space likelihood.\nContamination not modeled in the likelihood produces parameter-dependent bias\nand complicates the interpretation of the difference map. We describe a null\ntest that consistently weights the difference map. Excess variance should\neither be explicitly modeled in the covariance or be removed through\nreprocessing the data.\n", "  Aims: We present POLARIS (POLArized RadIation Simulator), a newly developed\nthree-dimensional Monte-Carlo radiative transfer code. POLARIS was designed to\ncalculate dust temperature, polarization maps, and spectral energy\ndistributions. It is optimized to handle data that results from sophisticated\nmagneto-hydrodynamic simulations. The main purpose of the code is to prepare\nand analyze multi-wavelength continuum polarization measurements in the context\nof magnetic field studies in the interstellar medium. An exemplary application\nis the investigation of the role of magnetic fields in star formation\nprocesses.\n  Methods: We combine currently discussed state-of-the-art grain alignment\ntheories with existing dust heating and polarization algorithms. We test the\nPOLARIS code on multiple scales in complex astrophysical systems that are\nassociated with different stages of star formation. POLARIS uses the full\nspectrum of dust polarization mechanisms to trace the underlying magnetic field\nmorphology.\n  Results: Resulting temperature distributions are consistent with the density\nand position of radiation sources resulting from magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) -\ncollapse simulations. The calculated layers of aligned dust grains in the\nconsidered cirumstellar disk models are in excellent agreement with theoretical\npredictions. Finally, we compute unique patterns in synthetic multi-wavelength\npolarization maps that are dependent on applied dust-model and grain-alignment\ntheory in analytical cloud models.\n", "  The electric dipole polarizability quantifies the low-energy behaviour of the\ndipole strength and is related to critical observables such as the radii of the\nproton and neutron distributions. Its computation is challenging because most\nof the dipole strength lies in the scattering continuum. In this paper we\ncombine integral transforms with the coupled-cluster method and compute the\ndipole polarizability using bound-state techniques. Employing different\ninteractions from chiral effective field theory, we confirm the strong\ncorrelation between the dipole polarizability and the charge radius, and study\nits dependence on three-nucleon forces. We find good agreement with data for\nthe 4He, 40Ca, and 16O nuclei, and predict the dipole polarizability for the\nrare nucleus 22O.\n", "  We optically drive a microsphere at constant speed through entangled actin\nnetworks of 0.2 - 1.4 mg/ml at rates faster than the critical rate controlling\nthe onset of a nonlinear response. By measuring the resistive force exerted on\nthe microsphere during and following strain we reveal a critical concentration\n$c^{*}\\simeq0.4$ mg/ml for nonlinear features to emerge. For $c>c^{*}$,\nentangled actin stiffens at short times with the degree of stiffening $S$ and\ncorresponding timescale $t_{stiff}$ scaling with the entanglement tube density,\ni.e. $S\\sim t_{stiff}\\sim d_t^{-1}\\sim c^{3/5}$. The network subsequently\nyields to a viscous regime with the yield distance $d_y$ scaling linearly with\nyield force $f_y$ and inversely with the entanglement length ($f_y\\sim d_y\\sim\nl_{e}^{-1} \\sim c^{2/5}$). Stiffening and yielding dynamics are consistent with\nrecent theoretical predictions for nonlinear cohesive breakdown of\nentanglements. We further show that above $c^{*}$ force relaxation proceeds via\nslow filament disengagement from dilated tubes coupled with $\\sim$10x faster\nlateral hopping, with the corresponding concentration dependences in agreement\nwith recent theoretical predictions for entangled rigid rods.\n", "  For white LEDs used for lighting museums, it is possible to reduce their\neffects on the discoloration of exhibits to a great extent by regulating their\nspectral distribution so that less lights with 420~470 nm of wavelength which\nacts on increasing the span of preservation of exhibits, such as pictures,\ncolor paper and color cloth. For same illumination of radiation of 5000 lx of\nwhite LEDs with different color temperature of about 3000, 3200, 4200 and 6500\nK, the density of radiation energy of 420 nm was 34.2, 71.8, 83.1 and 268.3\n{\\mu}W/cm2, respectively. The discoloration experiment shows that the effects\nof discoloration of cold white LEDs was much greater than those of warm white\nLEDs.\n", "  Iron chalcogenide superconductors are multi-band systems with strong electron\ncorrelations. Here we use angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy to study\nband dependent correlation effects in single-layer FeSe/Nb:BaTiO3/KTaO3, a new\niron chalcogenide superconductor with non-degenerate electron pockets and\ninterface-enhanced superconductivity. The non-degeneracy of the electron bands\nhelps to resolve the temperature dependent evolution of different bands. With\nincreasing temperature, the single layer FeSe undergoes a band-selective\nlocalization, in which the coherent spectral weight of one electron band is\ncompletely depleted while that of the other one remains finite. In addition,\nthe spectral weight of the incoherent background is enhanced with increasing\ntemperature, indicating a coherent-incoherent crossover. Signatures of\npolaronic behavior are observed, suggesting electron-boson interactions. These\nphenomena help to construct a more complete picture of electron correlations in\nthe FeSe family.\n", "  The shear measurement is a crucial task in the current and the future weak\nlensing survey projects. And the reconstruction of the point spread\nfunction(PSF) is one of the essential steps. In this work, we present three\ndifferent methods, including Gaussianlets, Moffatlets and EMPCA to quantify\ntheir efficiency on PSF reconstruction using four sets of simulated LSST star\nimages. Gaussianlets and Moffatlets are two different sets of basis functions\nwhose profiles are based on Gaussian and Moffat functions respectively.\nExpectation Maximization(EM) PCA is a statistical method performing iterative\nprocedure to find principal components of an ensemble of star images. Our tests\nshow that: 1) Moffatlets always perform better than Gaussianlets. 2) EMPCA is\nmore compact and flexible, but the noise existing in the Principal Components\n(PCs) will contaminate the size and ellipticity of PSF while Moffatlets keeps\nthem very well.\n", "  The theoretical modeling of gravitational waveforms from binary neutron star\nmergers requires precise numerical relativity simulations. Assessing\nconvergence of the numerical data and building the error budget is currently\nchallenging due to the low accuracy of general-relativistic hydrodynamics\nschemes and to the grid resolutions that can be employed in $(3+1)$-dimensional\nsimulations. In this work, we explore the use of high-order\nweighted-essentially-nonoscillatory (WENO) schemes in neutron star merger\nsimulations and investigate the accuracy of the waveforms obtained with such\nmethods. We find that high-order WENO schemes can be robustly employed for\nsimulating the inspiral-merger phase and they significantly improve the\nassessment of the waveform's error budget with respect to finite-volume\nmethods. High-order WENO schemes can be thus efficiently used for high-quality\nwaveforms production, also in future large-scale investigations of the binary\nparameter space.\n", "  We show that certain three-dimensional Horava-Lifshitz gravity theories can\nbe written as Chern-Simons gauge theories on various non-relativistic algebras.\nThe algebras are specific extensions of the Bargmann, Newton-Hooke and\nSchroedinger algebra each of which has the Galilean algebra as a subalgebra. To\nshow this we employ the fact that Horava-Lifshitz gravity corresponds to\ndynamical Newton-Cartan geometry. In particular, the extended Bargmann\n(Newton-Hooke) Chern-Simons theory corresponds to projectable Horava-Lifshitz\ngravity with a local U(1) gauge symmetry without (with) a cosmological\nconstant. Moreover we identify an extended Schroedinger algebra containing 3\nextra generators that are central with respect to the subalgebra of Galilean\nboosts, momenta and rotations, for which the Chern-Simons theory gives rise to\na novel version of non-projectable conformal Horava-Lifshitz gravity that we\nrefer to as Schroedinger gravity. This theory has a z=2 Lifshitz geometry as a\nvacuum solution and thus provides a new framework to study Lifshitz holography.\n", "  Hysteresis is more than just an interesting oddity, which occurs in materials\nwith a first-order transition. It is a real obstacle on the path from existing\nlab-scale prototypes of magnetic refrigerators towards commercialization of\nthis potentially disruptive cooling technology. Indeed, the reversibility of\nthe magnetocaloric effect, being essential for magnetic heat pumps, strongly\ndepends on the width of the thermal hysteresis and therefore it is necessary to\nunderstand the mechanisms causing hysteresis and to find solutions how to\nminimize losses associated with thermal hysteresis in order to maximize the\nefficiency of magnetic cooling devices. In this work, we discuss fundamental\naspects, which can contribute to thermal hysteresis and we are developing\nstrategies for at least partially overcoming the hysteresis problem in some\nselected classes of magnetocaloric materials with large application potential.\nDoing so, we refer to the most relevant classes of magnetic refrigerants\nLa-Fe-Si-, Heusler- and Fe2P-type compounds.\n", "  The computational difficulty of solving fully quantum many-body spin problems\nis a significant obstacle to understanding the behavior of strongly correlated\nquantum matter. Experimental ion-trap quantum simulation is a promising\napproach for studying these lattice spin models, but has so far been limited to\none-dimensional systems. This work argues that such quantum simulation\ntechniques are extendable to a 2D ion crystal confined in a radiofrequency (rf)\ntrap. Using appropriately chosen parameters, driven ion motion due to the rf\nfields can be made small and will not limit the types of quantum spin models\nthat can be experimentally encoded. The rf-driven motion is calculated to\nmodestly reduce the stability region of a 2D crystal and must be considered\nwhen designing the 2D trap. The system will be scalable to 100+ quantum\nparticles, far beyond the realm of classical intractability, while maintaining\nthe traditional ion-trap strengths of individual-ion control, long quantum\ncoherence times, and site-resolved projective spin measurements.\n", "  Very different strongly interacting quantum systems such as Fermi gases,\nquark-gluon plasmas formed in high energy ion collisions and black holes\nstudied theoretically in string theory are known to exhibit quantitatively\nsimilar damping of hydrodynamic modes. It is not known if such similarities\nextend beyond the hydrodynamic limit. Do non-hydrodynamic collective modes in\nFermi gases with strong interactions also match those from string theory\ncalculations? In order to answer this question, we use calculations based on\nstring theory to make predictions for novel types of modes outside the\nhydrodynamic regime in trapped Fermi gases. These predictions are amenable to\ndirect testing with current state-of-the-art cold atom experiments.\n", "  We present deep number counts at 450 and 850 $\\mu$m using the SCUBA-2 camera\non the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope. We combine data for six lensing cluster\nfields and three blank fields to measure the counts over a wide flux range at\neach wavelength. Thanks to the lensing magnification, our measurements extend\nto fluxes fainter than 1 mJy and 0.2 mJy at 450 $\\mu$m and 850 $\\mu$m,\nrespectively. Our combined data highly constrain the faint end of the number\ncounts. Integrating our counts shows that the majority of the extragalactic\nbackground light (EBL) at each wavelength is contributed by faint sources with\n$L_{\\rm IR} < 10^{12} L_{\\odot }$, corresponding to luminous infrared galaxies\n(LIRGs) or normal galaxies. By comparing our result with the 500 $\\mu$m\nstacking of $K$-selected sources from the literature, we conclude that the\n$K$-selected LIRGs and normal galaxies still cannot fully account for the EBL\nthat originates from sources with $L_{\\rm IR} < 10^{12} L_{\\odot }$. This\nsuggests that many faint submillimeter galaxies may not be included in the UV\nstar formation history. We also explore the submillimeter flux ratio between\nthe two bands for our 450 $\\mu$m and 850 $\\mu$m selected sources. At 850\n$\\mu$m, we find a clear relation between the flux ratio and the observed flux.\nThis relation can be explained by a redshift evolution, where galaxies at\nhigher redshifts have higher luminosities and star formation rates. In\ncontrast, at 450 $\\mu$m, we do not see a clear relation between the flux ratio\nand the observed flux.\n", "  We describe the construction of $2+1$-dimensional toplogically massive adS\ngravity with ${\\mathcal{N}}$-extended supersymmetry in superspace by means of\nintroducing a compensating hypermultiplet for the super-Weyl invariance. For\n$\\mathcal{N}\\geq 3$ the scalar multiplet must be on shell and the potential for\nthe scalar compensator is completely determined by the geometry. As a\nconsequence the resulting massive theory has no free parameter for\n$\\mathcal{N}\\geq 4$. For $\\mathcal{N}= 4$ we show that this leads to\ntopologically massive gravity at the chiral point and construct the\ncorresponding off-shell component action.\n", "  Recently, the magnetar Swift J1834.9$-$0846 is reported to have a possible\nwind nebula. It is shown that both the magnetar and its wind nebula are\nunderstandable in the wind braking scenario. The magnetar's rotational energy\nloss rate is not enough to power the particle luminosity. The required particle\nluminosity should be about $10^{36} \\,\\rm erg \\,s^{-1}$ to $10^{38} \\,\\rm erg\n\\,s^{-1}$. It is obtained in three different approaches: considering wind\nbraking of Swift J1834.9$-$0846; the spectral and spatial observations of the\nwind nebula; and an empirical upper bound on wind nebula X-ray luminosity. The\nnebula magnetic field is about $10^{-4} \\,\\rm G$. The possible wind nebula of\nSwift J1834.9$-$0846 should be a magnetar wind nebula. It is powered by the\nmagnetic energy release of the magnetar.\n", "  We propose a covariant ghost-free unimodular $F(R)$ gravity theory, which\ncontains a three-form field and study its structure using the analogy of the\nproposed theory with a quantum system which describes a charged particle in\nuniform magnetic field. Newton's law in non-covariant unimodular $F(R)$ gravity\nas well as in unimodular Einstein gravity is derived and it is shown to be just\nthe same as in General Relativity. The derivation of Newton's law in covariant\nunimodular $F(R)$ gravity shows that it is modified precisely in the same way\nas in the ordinary $F(R)$ theory. We also demonstrate that the cosmology of a\nFriedmann-Robertson-Walker background, is equivalent in the non-covariant and\ncovariant formulations of unimodular $F(R)$ theory.\n", "  Transitions among different mechanisms of two-proton decay are studied in\ngeneral. The introduced improved direct-decay model generalizes the\nsemi-analytical models used before and provides flawless phenomenological\ndescription of three-body correlations in $2p$ decays. This is demonstrated by\nexamples of the low-lying $^{16}$Ne state decays. Different forms of transition\ndynamic are shown to be highly probable beyond the proton dripline for the\n$s$-$d$ shell nuclei. It is demonstrated that transition dynamic of $2p$\nemitters can provide means for extraction of a width of the ground-state\nresonance of a core+$p$ subsystem of the core+$2p$ system. Practical\napplicability of the method is demonstrated by properties of the $^{14}$F\nground state derived from the $^{15}\\mbox{Ne}\\rightarrow\n^{\\,13\\!\\!}\\mbox{O}+2p$ decay data and of the $^{29}$Cl ground state derived\nfrom the $^{30}\\mbox{Ar}\\rightarrow ^{\\,28\\!\\!}\\mbox{S}+2p$ decay data.\n", "  Considering features of stellar spectral radiation and survey explorers, we\nestablished a computational model for stellar effective temperatures, detected\nangular parameters, and gray rates. Using known stellar flux data in some band,\nwe estimated stellar effective temperatures and detected angular parameters\nusing stochastic particle swarm optimization (SPSO). We first verified the\nreliability of SPSO, and then determined reasonable parameters that produced\nhighly accurate estimates under certain gray deviation levels. Finally, we\ncalculated 177,860 stellar effective temperatures and detected angular\nparameters using the Midcourse Space Experiment (MSX) catalog data. These\nderived stellar effective temperatures were accurate when we compared them to\nknown values from literatures. This research made full use of catalog data and\npresented an original technique for studying stellar characteristics. It\nproposed a novel method for calculating stellar effective temperatures and\ndetected angular parameters, and provided theoretical and practical data\nsupport for finding radiation flow information for any band.\n", "  We present numerical simulations of active fluid droplets immersed in an\nexternal fluid in 2-dimensions { using} an Immersed Boundary method to simulate\nthe fluid droplet interface as a Lagrangian mesh. We present results from two\nexample systems, firstly an active isotropic fluid boundary consisting of\nparticles that can bind and unbind from the interface and generate surface\ntension gradients through active contractility. Secondly, a droplet filled with\nan active polar fluid with { homeotropic} anchoring at the droplet interface.\nThese two systems demonstrate spontaneous symmetry breaking and steady state\ndynamics resembling cell motility and division and show complex feedback\nmechanisms with minimal degrees of freedom. The simulations outlined here will\nbe useful for quantifying the wide range of dynamics observable in these active\nsystems and modelling the effects of confinement in a consistent and adaptable\nway.\n", "  Photometric observations in Sloan g' and i' bands of four W UMa stars, NSVS\n2244206, NSVS 908513, CSS J004004.7+385531, VSX J062624.4+570907, are\npresented. The light curve solutions reveal that all targets have overcontact\nconfigurations with fillout factor within 0.15-0.26. Their components are of\nG-K spectral type and almost in thermal contacts. They are relatively close\nalso in size and luminosity: the radius rations r_2/r_1 are within 0.75-0.90;\nthe luminosity ratios l_2/l_1 are within 0.53-0.63. The results of the light\ncurve solution of CSS J004007.7+385531 imply weak limb-darkening effect of its\nprimary component and possible presence of additional absorbing feature in the\nsystem.\n", "  We consider mixed type multiple orthogonal polynomials associated with a\nsystem of weight functions consisting of two vectors. One vector is defined in\nterms of scaled modified Bessel function of the first kind $I_\\mu$ and\n$I_{\\mu+1}$, the other vector is defined in terms of scaled modified Bessel\nfunction of the second kind $K_\\nu$ and $K_{\\nu+1}$. We show that the\ncorresponding mixed type multiple orthogonal polynomials exist. For the special\ncase that each multi-index is on or close to the diagonal, basic properties of\nthe polynomials and their linear forms are investigated, which include explicit\nformulas, integral representations, differential properties, limiting forms and\nrecurrence relations. It comes out that, for specified parameters, the linear\nforms of these mixed type multiple orthogonal polynomials can be interpreted as\nbiorthogonal functions encountering in recent studies of products of two\ncoupled random matrices. This particularly implies a Riemann-Hilbert\ncharacterization of the correlation kernel, which provides an alternative way\nfor further asymptotic analysis.\n", "  In this paper we study $k$-order homogeneous Rota-Baxter operators with\nweight $1$ on the simple $3$-Lie algebra $A_{\\omega}$ (over a field of\ncharacteristic zero), which is realized by an associative commutative algebra\n$A$ and a derivation $\\Delta$ and an involution $\\omega$ (Lemma\n\\mref{lem:rbd3}). A $k$-order homogeneous Rota-Baxter operator on $A_{\\omega}$\nis a linear map $R$ satisfying $R(L_m)=f(m+k)L_{m+k}$ for all generators $\\{\nL_m~ |~ m\\in \\mathbb Z \\}$ of $A_{\\omega}$ and a map $f : \\mathbb Z\n\\rightarrow\\mathbb F$, where $k\\in \\mathbb Z$. We prove that $R$ is a $k$-order\nhomogeneous Rota-Baxter operator on $A_{\\omega}$ of weight $1$ with $k\\neq 0$\nif and only if $R=0$ (see Theorems 3.2, and $R$ is a $0$-order homogeneous\nRota-Baxter operator on $A_{\\omega}$ of weight $1$ if and only if $R$ is one of\nthe forty possibilities which are described in Theorems3.5, 3.7, 3.9, 3.10,\n3.18, 3.21 and 3.22.\n", "  This paper is a new step in the project of systematic description of colored\nknot polynomials started in arXiv:1506.00339. In this paper, we managed to\nexplicitly find the inclusive Racah matrix, i.e. the whole set of mixing\nmatrices in channels R^3->Q with all possible Q, for R=[3,1]. The calculation\nis made possible by the use of a newly-developed efficient highest-weight\nmethod, still it remains tedious. The result allows one to evaluate and\ninvestigate [3,1]-colored polynomials for arbitrary 3-strand knots, and this\nconfirms many previous conjectures on various factorizations, universality, and\ndifferential expansions. We consider in some detail the next-to-twist-knots\nthree-strand family (n,-1|1,-1) and deduce its colored HOMFLY. Also confirmed\nand clarified is the eigenvalue hypothesis for the Racah matrices, which\npromises to provide a shortcut to generic formulas for arbitrary\nrepresentations.\n", "  We study coherent optics in topological insulator surface states with broken\ntime-reversal symmetry and develop a theory for the dynamical Hall effect\ndriven by intense electromagnetic field. The influence of optical Stark effect\nenters as nonlinear dependence on the optical field in the resulting Faraday\n$\\theta_F$ and Kerr $\\theta_K$ rotations. This nonlinear correction is found to\ndecrease $\\theta_F$ with the strength of the A.C. electric field, whereas\n$\\theta_K$ exhibits a non-monotonic behavior. We also assess the effects of\nrelaxation and dephasing on the Hall and magneto-optical responses when the\nfrequency detuning is comparable to the inverse lifetime of the conduction\nelectrons.\n", "  As one of the most intriguing intrinsic properties of quantum world, quantum\nsuperposition provokes great interests in its own generation. Oszmaniec [Phys.\nRev. Lett. 116, 110403 (2016)] have proven that though a universal quantum\nmachine that creates superposition of arbitrary two unknown states is\nphysically impossible, a probabilistic protocol exists in the case of two input\nstates have nonzero overlaps with the referential state. Here we report a\nheralded quantum machine realizing superposition of arbitrary two unknown\nphotonic qubits as long as they have nonzero overlaps with the horizontal\npolarization state $|H\\rangle$. A total of 11 different qubit pairs are chosen\nto test this protocol by comparing the reconstructed output state with\ntheoretical expected superposition of input states. We obtain the average\nfidelity as high as 0.99, which shows the excellent reliability of our\nrealization. This realization not only deepens our understanding of quantum\nsuperposition but also has significant applications in quantum information and\nquantum computation, e.g., generating non-classical states in the context of\nquantum optics and realizing information compression by coherent superposition\nof results of independent runs of subroutines in a quantum computation.\n", "  The two-dimensional Green-Naghdi (GN) shallow-water model for surface gravity\nwaves is extended to incorporate the arbitrary higher-order dispersive effects.\nThis can be achieved by developing a novel asymptotic analysis applied to the\nbasic nonlinear water wave problem. The linear dispersion relation for the\nextended GN system is then explored in detail. In particular, we use its\ncharacteristics to discuss the well-posedness of the linearized problem. As\nillustrative examples of approximate model equations, we derive a higher-order\nmodel that is accurate to the fourth power of the dispersion parameter in the\ncase of a flat bottom topography, and address the related issues such as the\nlinear dispersion relation, conservation laws and the pressure distribution at\nthe fluid bottom on the basis of this model. The original GN model is then\nbriefly described in the case of an uneven bottom topography. Subsequently, the\nextended GN system presented here is shown to have the same Hamiltonian\nstructure as that of the original GN system. Last, we demonstrate that\nZakharov's Hamiltonian formulation of surface gravity waves is equivalent to\nthat of the extended GN system by rewriting the former system in terms of the\nmomentum density instead of the velocity potential at the free surface.\n", "  In this paper, we generalize the theory of Brownian motion and the\nOnsager-Machlup theory of fluctuations for spatially symmetric systems to\nequilibrium and nonequilibrium steady-state systems with a preferred spatial\ndirection, due to an external force. To do this, we extend the Langevin\nequation to include a bias, which is introduced by the external force and\nalters the Gaussian structure of the system's fluctuations. By solving this\nextended equation, we demonstrate that the statistical properties of the\nfluctuations in these systems can be predicted from physical observables, such\nas the temperature and the hydrodynamic gradients.\n", "  We predict a linear logarithmical scaling law of Bloch oscillation dynamics\nin Weyl semimetals (WSMs), which can be applied to detect Weyl nodal points.\nApplying the semiclassical dynamics for quasiparticles which are accelerated\nbypassing a Weyl point, we show that transverse drift exhibits asymptotically a\nlinear log-log relation with respect to the minimal momentum measured from the\nWeyl point. This linear scaling behavior is a consequence of the monopole\nstructure nearby the Weyl points, thus providing a direct measurement of the\ntopological nodal points, with the chirality and anisotropy being precisely\ndetermined. We apply the present results to two lattice models for WSMs which\ncan be realized with cold atoms in experiment, and propose realistic schemes\nfor the experimental detection. With the analytic and numerical results we show\nthe feasibility of identifying topological Weyl nodal points based on the\npresent prediction.\n", "  We exhibit a fundamental relationship between measures of dynamical and\nstructural stability of equilibriums, arising from real dynamical systems. We\nshow that dynamical stability, quantified via systems local response to\nexternal perturbations, coincides with the minimal internal perturbation able\nto destabilize the equilibrium. First, by reformulating a result of control\ntheory, we explain that harmonic external perturbations reflect the spectral\nsensitivity of the Jacobian matrix at the equilibrium, with respect to constant\nchanges of its coefficients. However, for this equivalence to hold, imaginary\nchanges of the Jacobian's coefficients have to be allowed. The connection with\ndynamical stability is thus lost for real dynamical systems. We show that this\nissue can be avoided, thus recovering the fundamental link between dynamical\nand structural stability, by considering stochastic noise as external and\ninternal perturbations. More precisely, we demonstrate that a system's local\nresponse to white-noise perturbations directly reflects the intensity of\ninternal white noise that it can accommodate before asymptotic mean-square\nstability of the equilibrium is lost.\n", "  Could the velocity spread, increasing with time, in the Galactic disk be\nexplained as a result of gravitational interactions of stars with giant\nmolecular clouds (GMCs) and spiral arms? Do the old open clusters high above\nthe Galactic plane provide clues to this question? We explore the effects on\nstellar orbits of scattering by inhomogeneities in the Galactic potential due\nto GMCs, spiral arms and the Galactic bar, and whether high-altitude clusters\ncould have formed in orbits closer to the Galactic plane and later been\nscattered.\n  Simulations of test-particle motions are performed in a realistic Galactic\npotential. The effects of the internal structure of GMCs are explored. The\ndestruction of clusters in GMC collisions is treated in detail with N-body\nsimulations of the clusters.\n  The observed velocity dispersions of stars as a function of time are well\nreproduced. The GMC structure is found to be significant, but adequate models\nproduce considerable scattering effects. The fraction of simulated massive old\nopen clusters, scattered into orbits with |z| > 400 pc, is typically 0:5%, in\nagreement with the observed number of high-altitude clusters and consistent\nwith the present formation rate of massive open clusters.\n  The heating of the thin Galactic disk is well explained by gravitational\nscattering by GMCs and spiral arms, if the local correlation between the GMC\nmass and the corresponding voids in the gas is not very strong. Our results\nsuggest that the high-altitude metal-rich clusters were formed in orbits close\nto the Galactic plane and later scattered to higher orbits. It is possible,\nthough not very probable, that the Sun formed in such a cluster before\nscattering occurred.\n", "  In Randall-Sundrum models, one typically expects the radion to be the\nlightest new \"gravity\" state, as it is dual to a composite pseudo-Goldstone\nboson associated with conformal symmetry breaking in the IR. Here, we\ninvestigate the effects of localized brane curvature on the properties of the\nradion in Goldberger-Wise stabilized Randall-Sundrum models. We point out that\nboth the radion mass and coupling to brane matter are sensitive to the brane\ncurvature. Radion/Higgs kinetic mixing, via an IR-localized non-minimal\ncoupling to the Higgs, is also investigated, in relation to the ghost-like\nradion that can occur for $\\mathcal{O}(10)$ values of the IR curvature (as\nrequired to significantly suppress the first Kaluza-Klein graviton mass). We\nalso discuss a class of speculative IR localized terms involving the radion.\nBasic comments regarding the dual 4D theory are offered.\n", "  We present the discovery of a giant $\\gtrsim$100~kpc Ly$\\alpha$ nebula\ndetected in the core of the X-ray emitting cluster CL~J1449+0856 at $z=1.99$\nthrough Keck/LRIS narrow-band imaging. This detection extends the known\nrelation between Ly$\\alpha$ nebulae and overdense regions of the Universe to\nthe dense core of a $5-7\\times10^{13}$ M$_{\\odot}$ cluster. The most plausible\ncandidates to power the nebula are two Chandra-detected AGN host cluster\nmembers, while cooling from the X-ray phase and cosmological cold flows are\ndisfavored primarily because of the high Ly$\\alpha$ to X-ray luminosity ratio\n($L_{\\mathrm{Ly\\alpha}}/L_{\\mathrm{X}} \\approx0.3$, $\\gtrsim10-1000\\times$\nhigher than in local cool-core clusters) and by current modeling. Given the\nphysical conditions of the Ly$\\alpha$-emitting gas and the possible interplay\nwith the X-ray phase, we argue that the Ly$\\alpha$ nebula would be short-lived\n($\\lesssim10$ Myr) if not continuously replenished with cold gas at a rate of\n$\\gtrsim1000$ M$_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. We investigate the possibility that\ncluster galaxies supply the required gas through outflows and we show that\ntheir total mass outflow rate matches the replenishment necessary to sustain\nthe nebula. This scenario directly implies the extraction of energy from\ngalaxies and its deposition in the surrounding intracluster medium, as required\nto explain the thermodynamic properties of local clusters. We estimate an\nenergy injection of the order of $\\thickapprox2$ keV per particle in the\nintracluster medium over a $2$ Gyr interval. In our baseline calculation AGN\nprovide up to $85$% of the injected energy and 2/3 of the mass, while the rest\nis supplied by supernovae-driven winds.\n", "  Classification of possible quantum spin liquid (QSL) states of interacting\nspin-1/2's in two dimensions has been a fascinating topic of condensed matter\nfor decades, resulting in enormous progress in our understanding of\nlow-dimensional quantum matter. By contrast, relatively little work exists on\nthe identification, let alone classification, of QSL phases for spin-1 systems\nin dimensions higher than one. Employing the powerful ideas of tensor network\ntheory and its classification, we develop general methods for writing QSL wave\nfunctions of spin-1 respecting all the lattice symmetries, spin rotation, and\ntime reversal with trivial gauge structure on the square lattice. We find $2^5$\ndistinct classes characterized by five binary quantum numbers. Several explicit\nconstructions of such wave functions are given for bond dimensions $D$ ranging\nfrom two to four, along with thorough numerical analyses to identify their\nphysical characters. Both gapless and gapped states are found. The topological\nentanglement entropy of the gapped states are close to zero, indicative of\ntopologically trivial states. In $D=4$, several different tensors can be\nlinearly combined to produce a family of states within the same symmetry class.\nA rich \"phase diagram\" can be worked out among the phases of these tensors, as\nwell as the phase transitions among them. Among the states we identified in\nthis putative phase diagram is the plaquette-ordered phase, gapped resonating\nvalence bond phase, and a critical phase. A continuous transition separates the\nplaquette-ordered phase from the resonating valence bond phase.\n", "  We investigate gravitational Cherenkov radiation in a healthy branch of\nbackground solutions in the ghost-free bigravity model. In this model, because\nof the modification of dispersion relations, each polarization mode can possess\nsubluminal phase velocities, and the gravitational Cherenkov radiation could be\npotentially emitted from a relativistic particle. In the present paper, we\nderive conditions for the process of the gravitational Cherenkov radiation to\noccur and estimate the energy emission rate for each polarization mode. We\nfound that the gravitational Cherenkov radiation emitted even from an ultrahigh\nenergy cosmic ray is sufficiently suppressed for the graviton's effective mass\nless than $100\\,{\\rm eV}$, and the bigravity model with dark matter coupled to\nthe hidden metric is therefore consistent with observations of high energy\ncosmic rays.\n", "  We introduce a particle-hole-symmetric metallic state of bosons in a magnetic\nfield at odd-integer filling. This state hosts composite fermions whose energy\ndispersion features a quadratic band touching and corresponding $2\\pi$ Berry\nflux protected by particle-hole and discrete rotation symmetries. We also\nconstruct an alternative particle-hole symmetric state---distinct in the\npresence of inversion symmetry---without Berry flux. As in the Dirac composite\nFermi liquid introduced by Son, breaking particle-hole symmetry recovers the\nfamiliar Chern-Simons theory. We discuss realizations of this phase both in 2D\nand on bosonic topological insulator surfaces, as well as signatures in\nexperiments and simulations.\n", "  We present high-contrast angular differential imaging (ADI) observations of\nthe debris disk around HD 32297 in H-band, as well as the first polarimetric\nimages for this system in polarized differential imaging (PDI) mode with\nSubaru/HICIAO. In ADI, we detect the nearly edge-on disk at >5sigma levels from\n~0.45 arcsec to ~1.7 arcsec (50-192 AU) from the star and recover the spine\ndeviation from the midplane already found in previous works. We also find for\nthe first time imaging and surface brightness (SB) indications for the presence\nof a gapped structure on both sides of the disk at distances of ~0.75 arcsec\n(NE side) and ~0.65 arcsec (SW side). Global forward-modelling work delivers a\nbest-fit model disk and well-fitting parameter intervals that essentially match\nprevious results, with high-forward scattering grains and a ring located at 110\nAU. However, this single ring model cannot account for the gapped structure\nseen in our SB profiles. We create simple double ring models and achieve a\nsatisfactory fit with two rings located at 60 and 95 AU, respectively,\nlow-forward scattering grains and very sharp inner slopes. In polarized light\nwe retrieve the disk extending from ~0.25-1.6 arcsec, although the central\nregion is quite noisy and high S/N are only found in the range ~0.75-1.2\narcsec. The disk is polarized in the azimuthal direction, as expected, and the\ndeparture from the midplane is also clearly observed. Evidence for a gapped\nscenario is not found in the PDI data. We obtain a linear polarization degree\nof the grains that increases from ~10% at 0.55 arcsec to ~25% at 1.6 arcsec.\nThe maximum is found at scattering angles of ~90degrees, either from the main\ncomponents of the disk or from dust grains blown out to larger radii.\n", "  Non-locality is a fundamental trait of quantum many-body systems, both at the\nlevel of pure states, as well as at the level of mixed states. Due to\nnon-locality, mixed states of any two subsystems are correlated in a stronger\nway than what can be accounted for by considering correlated probabilities of\noccupying some microstates. In the case of equilibrium mixed states, we\nexplicitly build two-point quantum correlation functions, which capture the\nspecific, superior correlations of quantum systems at finite temperature, and\nwhich are directly { accessible to experiments when correlating measurable\nproperties}. When non-vanishing, these correlation functions rule out a precise\nform of separability of the equilibrium state. In particular, we show\nnumerically that quantum correlation functions generically exhibit a finite\n\\emph{quantum coherence length}, dictating the characteristic distance over\nwhich degrees of freedom cannot be considered as separable. This coherence\nlength is completely disconnected from the correlation length of the system --\nas it remains finite even when the correlation length of the system diverges at\nfinite temperature -- and it unveils the unique spatial structure of quantum\ncorrelations.\n", "  The art of imparting information onto a light wave by optical signal\nmodulation is fundamental to all forms of optical communication. Among many\nschemes, direct modulation of laser diodes stands out as a simple, robust, and\ncost effective method. However, the simultaneous changes in intensity,\nfrequency and phase are a drawback which has prevented its application in the\nfield of secure quantum communication. Here, we propose and experimentally\ndemonstrate a directly phase-modulated light source which overcomes the main\ndisadvantages associated with direct modulation and is suitable for diverse\napplications such as coherent communications and quantum cryptography. The\nsource separates the tasks of phase preparation and pulse generation between a\npair of semiconductor lasers leading to very pure phase states. Moreover, the\ncavity enhanced electro-optic effect enables the first example of sub-volt\nhalfwave phase modulation at high signal rates. The source is compact, stable\nand versatile, and we show its potential to become the standard transmitter for\nfuture quantum communication networks.\n", "  We surveyed the 25 Ori association for direct-imaging companions. This\nassociation has an age of only few million years. Among other targets, we\nobserved CVSO 30, which has recently been identified as the first T Tauri star\nfound to host a transiting planet candidate. We report on photometric and\nspectroscopic high-contrast observations with the Very Large Telescope, the\nKeck telescopes, and the Calar Alto observatory. They reveal a directly imaged\nplanet candidate close to the young M3 star CVSO 30. The JHK-band photometry of\nthe newly identified candidate is at better than 1 sigma consistent with\nlate-type giants, early-T and early-M dwarfs, and free-floating planets. Other\nhypotheses such as galaxies can be excluded at more than 3.5 sigma. A lucky\nimaging z' photometric detection limit z'= 20.5 mag excludes early-M dwarfs and\nresults in less than 10 MJup for CVSO 30 c if bound. We present spectroscopic\nobservations of the wide companion that imply that the only remaining\nexplanation for the object is that it is the first very young (< 10 Myr)\nL-T-type planet bound to a star, meaning that it appears bluer than expected as\na result of a decreasing cloud opacity at low effective temperatures. Only a\nplanetary spectral model is consistent with the spectroscopy, and we deduce a\nbest-fit mass of 4-5 Jupiter masses (total range 0.6-10.2 Jupiter masses). This\nmeans that CVSO 30 is the first system in which both a close-in and a wide\nplanet candidate are found to have a common host star. The orbits of the two\npossible planets could not be more different: they have orbital periods of\n10.76 hours and about 27000 years. The two orbits may have formed during a\nmutual catastrophic event of planet-planet scattering.\n", "  We measure the donor-bound electron longitudinal spin-relaxation time ($T_1$)\nas a function of magnetic field ($B$) in three high-purity direct-bandgap\nsemiconductors: GaAs, InP, and CdTe, observing a maximum $T_1$ of\n$1.4~\\text{ms}$, $0.4~\\text{ms}$ and $1.2~\\text{ms}$, respectively. In GaAs and\nInP at low magnetic field, up to $\\sim2~\\text{T}$, the spin-relaxation\nmechanism is strongly density and temperature dependent and is attributed to\nthe random precession of the electron spin in hyperfine fields caused by the\nlattice nuclear spins. In all three semiconductors at high magnetic field, we\nobserve a power-law dependence ${T_1 \\propto B^{-\\nu}}$ with ${3\\lesssim \\nu\n\\lesssim 4}$. Our theory predicts that the direct spin-phonon interaction is\nimportant in all three materials in this regime in contrast to quantum dot\nstructures. In addition, the \"admixture\" mechanism caused by Dresselhaus\nspin-orbit coupling combined with single-phonon processes has a comparable\ncontribution in GaAs. We find excellent agreement between high-field theory and\nexperiment for GaAs and CdTe with no free parameters, however a significant\ndiscrepancy exists for InP.\n", "  Previously, we proposed that the polarization and capacitive charge in\n\\ce{CH3NH3PbI3} screens the external electric field that hinders charge\ntransport. We argue here that this screening effect is in significant part\nresponsible for the power conversion characteristics and hysteresis in\n\\ce{CH3NH3PbI3} photovoltaic cells. In this paper, we implement capacitive\ncharge and polarization charge into the numerical model that we have developed\nfor perovskite solar cells. Fields induced by these two charges screen the\napplied hindering field, promote charge transport, and improve solar cell's\nperformance, especially in solar cells with short diffusion lengths. This is\nthe reason why perovskite solar cells made from simple fabrication methods can\nachieve high performance. More importantly, with relaxations of capacitive\ncharge and polarization charge, we quantitatively reproduce experimental\n\"anomalous\" hysteresis J-V curves. This reveals that both polarization\nrelaxation and ions relaxation could contribute to anomalous hysteresis in\nperovskite solar cells.\n", "  Macroscopic behavior of scientific and societal systems results from the\naggregation of microscopic behaviors of their constituent elements, but\nconnecting the macroscopic with the microscopic in human behavior has\ntraditionally been difficult. Manifestations of homophily, the notion that\nindividuals tend to interact with others who resemble them, have been observed\nin many small and intermediate size settings. However, whether this behavior\ntranslates to truly macroscopic levels, and what its consequences may be,\nremains unknown. Here, we use call detail records (CDRs) to examine the\npopulation dynamics and manifestations of social and spatial homophily at a\nmacroscopic level among the residents of 23 states of India at the Kumbh Mela,\na 3-month-long Hindu festival. We estimate that the festival was attended by 61\nmillion people, making it the largest gathering in the history of humanity.\nWhile we find strong overall evidence for both types of homophily for residents\nof different states, participants from low-representation states show\nconsiderably stronger propensity for both social and spatial homophily than\nthose from high-representation states. These manifestations of homophily are\namplified on crowded days, such as the peak day of the festival, which we\nestimate was attended by 25 million people. Our findings confirm that\nhomophily, which here likely arises from social influence, permeates all scales\nof human behavior.\n", "  The strongly constrained and appropriately normed (SCAN) semilocal density\nfunctional [J. Sun, A. Ruzsinszky, J. P. Perdew \\textit{Phys. Rev. Lett.} {\\bf\n115}, 036402 (2015)] obeys all 17 known exact constraints for\nmeta-generalized-gradient approximations (meta-GGA) and includes some medium\nrange correlation effects. Long-range London dispersion interactions are still\nmissing, but can be accounted for via an appropriate correction scheme. In this\nstudy, we combine SCAN with an efficient London dispersion correction and show\nthat lattice energies of simple organic crystals can be improved with the\napplied correction by 50\\%. The London-dispersion corrected SCAN meta-GGA\noutperforms all other tested London-dispersion corrected meta-GGAs for\nmolecular geometries. Our new method delivers mean absolute deviations (MADs)\nfor main group bond lengths that are consistently below 1\\,pm, rotational\nconstants with MADs of 0.2\\%, and noncovalent distances with MADs below 1\\%.\nFor a large database of general main group thermochemistry and kinetics, it\nalso delivers a weighted mean absolute deviation below 4 kcal/mol, one of the\nlowest for long-range corrected meta-GGA functionals. We also discuss some\nconsequences of numerical sensitivity encountered for meta-GGAs.\n", "  We investigate $\\eta/s$ in linear scalar fields modified Gauss-Bonnet theory\nthat breaks translation invariance. We first calculate $\\eta/s$ both\nanalytically and numerically and show its relationship with temperature in\nlog-log plot. Our results show that $\\eta/s\\sim T^2$ at low temperatures. The\ncausality is also considered in this work. We then find that causality\nviolation still happens in the presence of the linear scalar field and we\nsuggest there is a Gauss-Bonnet coupling dependent lower limit for the\neffective mass of the graviton. If the effective mass of the graviton is big\nenough, then there will be no causality violation and hence no constraints for\nthe Gauss-Bonnet coupling.\n", "  Emission lines from the broad emission line region (BELR) and the narrow\nemission line region (NELR) of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are extensively\nstudied. However, between these two regions emission lines are rarely detected.\nWe present a detailed analysis of a quasar SDSS J232444.80-094600.3 (SDSS\nJ2324$-$0946), which is remarkable for its strong intermediate-width emission\nlines (IELs) with FWHM $\\approx$ 1800 \\kmps. The IEL component is presented in\ndifferent emission lines, including the permitted lines \\lya\\ $\\lambda$1216,\n\\civ\\ $\\lambda$1549, semiforbidden line \\ciii\\ $\\lambda$1909, and forbidden\nlines \\oiii\\ $\\lambda\\lambda$4959, 5007. With the aid of photo-ionization\nmodels, we found that the IELs are produced by gas with a hydrogen density of\n$n_{\\rm H} \\sim 10^{6.2}-10^{6.3}~\\rm cm^{-3}$, a distance to the central\nionizing source of $R \\sim 35-50$ pc, a covering factor of CF $\\sim$ 6\\%, and a\ndust-to-gas ratio of $\\leq 4\\%$ times of SMC. We suggest that the strong IELs\nof this quasar are produced by nearly dust-free and intermediate-density gas\nlocated at the skin of the dusty torus. Such strong IELs, served as a useful\ndiagnose, can provide an avenue to study the properties of gas between the BELR\nand the NELR.\n", "  Quantum jumps of a qubit are usually observed between its energy eigenstates,\nalso known as its longitudinal pseudo-spin component. Is it possible, instead,\nto observe quantum jumps between the transverse superpositions of these\neigenstates? We answer positively by presenting the first continuous quantum\nnondemolition measurement of the transverse component of an individual qubit.\nIn a circuit QED system irradiated by two pump tones, we engineer an effective\nHamiltonian whose eigenstates are the transverse qubit states, and a dispersive\nmeasurement of the corresponding operator. Such transverse component\nmeasurements are a useful tool in the driven-dissipative operation engineering\ntoolbox, which is central to quantum simulation and quantum error correction.\n", "  Context. Efforts to look for signatures of the first stars have concentrated\non metal-poor halo objects. However, the low end of the bulge metallicity\ndistribution has been shown to host some of the oldest objects in the Milky Way\nand hence this Galactic component potentially offers interesting targets to\nlook at imprints of the first stellar generations. As a pilot project, we\nselected bulge field stars already identified in the ARGOS survey as having\n[Fe/H] ~ -1 and oversolar [alpha/Fe] ratios, and we used FLAMES-UVES to obtain\ndetailed abundances of key elements that are believed to reveal imprints of the\nfirst stellar generations. Aims. The main purpose of this study is to analyse\nselected ARGOS stars using new high-resolution (R~45,000) and\nhigh-signal-to-noise (S/N >100) spectra. We aim to derive their stellar\nparameters and elemental ratios, in particular the abundances of C, N, the\nalpha-elements O, Mg, Si, Ca, and Ti, the odd-Z elements Na and Al, the\nneutron-capture s-process dominated elements Y, Zr, La, and Ba, and the\nr-element Eu. Methods. High-resolution spectra of five field giant stars were\nobtained at the 8m VLT UT2-Kueyen telescope with the UVES spectrograph in\nFLAMES-UVES configuration. Spectroscopic parameters were derived based on the\nexcitation and ionization equilibrium of Fe I and Fe II. The abundance analysis\nwas performed with a MARCS LTE spherical model atmosphere grid and the\nTurbospectrum spectrum synthesis code.\n", "  We present results of a coherent x-ray diffractive imaging experiment\nperformed on a single colloidal crystal grain. The full three-dimensional (3D)\nreciprocal space map measured by an azimuthal rotational scan contained several\norders of Bragg reflections together with the coherent interference signal\nbetween them. Applying the iterative phase retrieval approach, the 3D structure\nof the crystal grain was reconstructed and positions of individual colloidal\nparticles were resolved. As a result, an exact stacking sequence of hexagonal\nclose-packed layers including planar and linear defects were identified.\n", "  We study drag-driven instability in a protoplanetary disc consisting of a\nlayer of single-sized dust particles which are coupled to the magnetized gas\naerodynamically and the particle-to-gas feedback is included. We find a\ndispersion relation for axisymmetric linear disturbances and growth rate of the\nunstable modes are calculated numerically. While the secular gravitational\ninstability in the absence of particle-to-gas feedback predicts the dust layer\nis unstable, magnetic fields significantly amplifies the instability if the\nToomre parameter for the gas component is fixed. We also show that even a weak\nmagnetic field is able to amplify the instability more or less irrespective of\nthe dust-gas coupling.\n", "  We present results from fully relativistic three-dimensional core-collapse\nsupernova (CCSN) simulations of a non-rotating 15 Msun star using three\ndifferent nuclear equations of state (EoSs). From our simulations covering up\nto ~350 ms after bounce, we show that the development of the standing accretion\nshock instability (SASI) differs significantly depending on the stiffness of\nnuclear EoS. Generally, the SASI activity occurs more vigorously in models with\nsofter EoS. By evaluating the gravitational-wave (GW) emission, we find a new\nGW signature on top of the previously identified one, in which the typical GW\nfrequency increases with time due to an accumulating accretion to the\nproto-neutron star (PNS). The newly observed quasi-periodic signal appears in\nthe frequency range from ~100 to 200 Hz and persists for ~150 ms before\nneutrino-driven convection dominates over the SASI. By analyzing the cycle\nfrequency of the SASI sloshing and spiral modes as well as the mass accretion\nrate to the emission region, we show that the SASI frequency is correlated with\nthe GW frequency. This is because the SASI-induced temporary perturbed mass\naccretion strike the PNS surface, leading to the quasi-periodic GW emission.\nOur results show that the GW signal, which could be a smoking-gun signature of\nthe SASI, is within the detection limits of LIGO, advanced Virgo, and KAGRA for\nGalactic events.\n", "  When conducting a Bell test, it is normal to assume that the preparation of\nthe quantum state is independent of the measurements performed on it.\nRemarkably, the violation of local realism by entangled quantum systems can be\ncertified even if this assumption is partially relaxed. Here, we allow such\nmeasurement dependence to correlate multiple runs of the experiment, going\nbeyond previous studies that considered independent and identically distributed\n(i.i.d.) runs. To do so, we study the polytope that defines block-i.i.d.\nmeasurement-dependent local models. We prove that non-i.i.d. models are\nstrictly more powerful than i.i.d. ones, and comment on the relevance of this\nwork for the study of randomness amplification in simple Bell scenarios with\nsuitably optimised inequalities.\n", "  Detecting a deviation from a featureless primordial power spectrum of\nfluctuations would give profound insight into the physics of the primordial\nUniverse. Depending on their nature, primordial features can either provide\ndirect evidence for the inflation scenario or pin down details of the inflation\nmodel. Thus far, using the cosmic microwave background (CMB) we have only been\nable to put stringent constraints on the amplitude of features, but no\nsignificant evidence has been found for such signals. Here we explore the limit\nof the experimental reach in constraining such features using 21 cm tomography\nat high redshift. A measurement of the 21 cm power spectrum from the Dark Ages\nis generally considered as the ideal experiment for early Universe physics,\nwith potentially access to a large number of modes. We consider three different\ncategories of theoretically motivated models: the sharp feature models,\nresonance models, and standard clock models. We study the improvements on\nbounds on features as a function of the total number of observed modes and\nidentify parameter degeneracies. The detectability depends critically on the\namplitude, frequency and scale-location of the features, as well as the angular\nand redshift resolution of the experiment. We quantify these effects by\nconsidering different fiducial models. Our forecast shows that a cosmic\nvariance limited 21 cm experiment measuring fluctuations in the redshift range\n$30\\leq z \\leq 100$ with a 0.01-MHz bandwidth and sub-arcminute angular\nresolution could potentially improve bounds by several orders of magnitude for\nmost features compared to current Planck bounds. At the same time, 21 cm\ntomography also opens up a unique window into features that are located on very\nsmall scales.\n", "  Background: Long-baseline experiments such as the planned Deep Underground\nNeutrino Experiment (DUNE) require theoretical descriptions of the complete\nevent in a neutrino-nucleus reaction. Since nuclear targets are used this\nrequires a good understanding of neutrino-nucleus interactions.\n  Purpose: Develop a consistent theory and code framework for the description\nof lepton-nucleus interactions that can be used to describe not only inclusive\ncross sections, but also the complete final state of the reaction.\n  Methods: The Giessen-Boltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck (GiBUU) implementation of\nquantum-kinetic transport theory is used, with improvements in its treatment of\nthe nuclear ground state and of 2p2h interactions. For the latter an empirical\nstructure function from electron scattering data is used as a basis.\n  Results: Results for electron-induced inclusive cross sections are given as a\nnecessary check for the overall quality of this approach. The calculated\nneutrino-induced inclusive double-differential cross sections show good\nagreement with data from neutrino- and antineutrino reactions for different\nneutrino flavors at MiniBooNE and T2K. Inclusive double-differential cross\nsections for MicroBooNE, NOvA, MINERvA and LBNF/DUNE are given.\n  Conclusions: Based on the GiBUU model of lepton-nucleus descriptions a good\ntheoretical description of inclusive electron-, neutrino- and\nantineutrino-nucleus data over a wide range of energies, different neutrino\nflavors and different experiments is now possible. Since no tuning is involved\nthis theory and code should be reliable also for new energy regimes and target\nmasses. \\end{description}\n", "  In this work, we establish a connection between the extended Prelle-Singer\nprocedure with other widely used analytical methods to identify integrable\nsystems in the case of $n^{th}$-order nonlinear ordinary differential equations\n(ODEs). By synthesizing these methods we bring out the interlink between Lie\npoint symmetries, contact symmetries, $\\lambda$-symmetries, adjoint-symmetries,\nnull forms, Darboux polynomials, integrating factors, Jacobi last multiplier\nand generalized $\\lambda$-symmetries corresponding to the $n^{th}$-order ODEs.\nWe also prove these interlinks with suitable examples. By exploiting these\ninterconnections, the characteristic quantities associated with different\nmethods can be deduced without solving the associated determining equations.\n", "  Rotational mixing is a prime candidate for explaining the gradual depletion\nof lithium from the photospheres of cool stars during the main sequence.\nHowever, previous mixing calculations have relied primarily on treatments of\nangular momentum transport in stellar interiors incompatible with solar and\nstellar data, in the sense that they overestimate internal differential\nrotation. Instead, recent studies suggest that stars are strongly\ndifferentially rotating at young ages, but approach solid body rotation during\ntheir lifetimes. We modify our rotating stellar evolution code to include an\nadditional source of angular momentum transport, a necessary ingredient for\nexplaining the open cluster rotation pattern, and examine the consequences for\nmixing. We confirm that core-envelope recoupling with a $\\sim$20 Myr timescale\nis required to explain the evolution of the mean solar-mass rotation pattern\nalong the main sequence, and demonstrate that it also provides a more accurate\ndescription of the Li depletion pattern seen in open clusters. Recoupling\nproduces a characteristic pattern of efficient mixing at early ages and little\nmixing at late ages, thus predicting a flattening of Li depletion at a few Gyr,\nin agreement with the observed late-time evolution. Using Li abundances, we\nargue that the timescale for core-envelope recoupling during the main sequence\ndecreases sharply with increasing mass. We discuss implications of this finding\nfor stellar physics, including the viability of gravity waves and magnetic\nfields as agents of angular momentum transport. We also raise the possibility\nof intrinsic differences in initial conditions in star clusters, using M67 as\nan example.\n", "  We have performed magnetization measurements of the gapped quantum magnet\nCsFeCl$_3$ at temperatures ($T$) down to 0.5\\,K at ambient pressure and down to\n1.8\\,K at hydrostatic pressures ($P$) of up to 1.5\\,GPa. The lower-field ($H$)\nphase boundary of the field-induced ordered phase at ambient pressure is found\nto follow the power-law behavior expressed by the formula $H_{\\rm\nN}(T)$\\,$-$\\,$H_{\\rm c}$\\,$\\propto$\\,$T_{\\rm N}^{\\phi}$. The application of\npressure extends the phase boundary to both a lower field and higher\ntemperature. Above the critical pressure $P_{\\rm c}$\\,$\\sim$\\,0.9\\,GPa, the\ntransition field $H_{\\rm N}$ associated with the excitation gap becomes zero,\nand a signature of the magnetic phase transition is found in the $T$-dependence\nof magnetization in a very low applied field. This suggests that CsFeCl$_3$\nexhibits a pressure-induced magnetic phase transition at $P_{\\rm c}$.\n", "  In order to investigate the importance of dissipation in the pulsar\nmagnetosphere we decided to combine Force-Free with Aristotelian\nElectrodynamics. We obtain solutions that are ideal (non-dissipative)\neverywhere except in an equatorial current sheet where Poynting flux from both\nhemispheres converges and is dissipated into particle acceleration and\nradiation. We find significant dissipative losses (up to about 50% of the\npulsar spindown luminosity), similar to what is found in global PIC simulations\nin which particles are provided only on the stellar surface. We conclude that\nthere might indeed exist two types of pulsars, strongly dissipative ones with\nparticle injection only from the stellar surface, and ideal (weakly\ndissipative) ones with particle injection in the outer magnetosphere and in\nparticular at the Y-point.\n", "  We study the collective behavior of Majorana modes in the vortex state of\nchiral $p$-wave superconductors. Away from the isolated vortex limit, the\nzero-energy Majorana states communicate with each other on a vortex lattice,\nand form a coherent band structure with non-trivial topological character. We\nrevealed that the topological nature of Majorana bands changes sensitively via\nquantum phase transitions in the two-dimensional (2D) systems, as sweeping\nmagnetic field or Fermi energy. Through the dimensional reduction, we showed\nthe existence of generic superconducting Weyl phase in a low magnetic field\nregion of quasi-2D-chiral superconductors.\n", "  The selection rules of high harmonic generation (HHG) are investigated using\nthree-dimensional time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT). From the\nharmonic spectra obtained with various real molecules and different forms of\nlaser fields, several factors that contribute to selection rules are revealed.\nExtending the targets to stereoscopic molecules, it is shown that the allowed\nharmonics are dependent on the symmetries of the projections of molecules. For\nlaser fields, the symmetries contributing to the selection rules are discussed\naccording to Lissajous figures and their dynamical directivities. All the\nphenomena are explained by the symmetry of the full time-dependent Hamiltonian\nunder a combined transformation. We present a systematic study on the selection\nrules and propose an intuitive method for the judgment of allowed harmonic\norders, which can be extended to more complex molecules and various forms of\nlaser pulses.\n", "  In the present work, the problem of an all-coupling analytic description for\nthe optical conductivity of the Froehlich polaron is treated, with the goal\nbeing to bridge the gap in validity range that exists between two complementary\nmethods: on the one hand the memory function formalism and on the other hand\nthe strong-coupling expansion based on the Franck-Condon picture for the\npolaron response. At intermediate coupling, both methods were found to fail as\nthey do not reproduce Diagrammatic Quantum Monte Carlo results. To resolve\nthis, we modify the memory function formalism with respect to the\nFeynman-Hellwarth-Iddings-Platzman (FHIP) approach, in order to take into\naccount a non-quadratic interaction in a model system for the polaron. The\nstrong-coupling expansion is extended beyond the adiabatic approximation, by\nincluding into the treatment non-adiabatic transitions between excited polaron\nstates. The polaron optical conductivity that we obtain by combining the two\nextended methods agree well, both qualitatively and quantitatively, with the\nDiagrammatic Quantum Monte Carlo results in the whole available range of the\nelectron-phonon coupling strength.\n", "  The effect of non-equilibrium constraints and dephasing on the circulating\ncurrents in molecular junctions are analyzed. Circulating currents are\nmanifestations of quantum effects and can be induced either by externally\napplied bias or an external magnetic field through the molecular system. In\nsymmetric Aharonov-Bohm ring, bond currents have two contributions, bias driven\nand magnetic field driven. We analyze the competition between these two\ncontributions and show that, as a consequence, current through one of the\nbranches can be completely suppressed. We then study the effect of asymmetry\n(as a result of chemical substitution) on the current pathways inside the\nmolecule and study asymmetry induced circulating currents (without magnetic\nfield) by tuning the coupling strength of the substituent (at finite bias).\n", "  We study the glassy dynamics taking place in dense assemblies of athermal\nactive particles that are driven solely by a nonequilibrium self-propulsion\nmechanism. Active forces are modeled as an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck stochastic\nprocess, characterized by a persistence time and an effective temperature, and\nparticles interact via a Lennard-Jones potential that yields well-studied\nglassy behavior in the Brownian limit, obtained as the persistence time\nvanishes. By increasing the persistence time, the system departs more strongly\nfrom thermal equilibrium and we provide a comprehensive numerical analysis of\nthe structure and dynamics of the resulting active fluid. Finite persistence\ntimes profoundly affect the static structure of the fluid and give rise to\nnonequilibrium velocity correlations that are absent in thermal systems.\nDespite these nonequilibrium features, for any value of the persistence time we\nobserve a nonequilibrium glass transition as the effective temperature is\ndecreased. Surprisingly, increasing departure from thermal equilibrium is found\nto promote (rather than suppress) the glassy dynamics. Overall, our results\nsuggest that with increasing persistence time, microscopic properties of the\nactive fluid change quantitatively, but the broad features of the\nnonequilibrium glassy dynamics observed with decreasing the effective\ntemperature remain qualitatively similar to those of thermal glass-formers.\n", "  Powerful incoherent laser pulses can propagate in focusing Kerr media much\nlonger distances than can coherent pulses, due to the fast phase mixing that\nprevents transverse filamentation. This distance is limited by 4-wave\nscattering, which accumulates waves at small transverse wavenumbers, where\nphase mixing is too slow to retain the incoherence and thus prevent the\nfilamentation. However, we identify how this theoretical limit can be overcome\nby countering this accumulation through transverse heating of the pulse by\nrandom fluctuations of the refractive index. In these new regimes, the laser\npulse propagation distances are significantly extended, making feasible a new\nclass of random lasers, in particular, ultra-powerful random lasers in plasmas.\n", "  The $\\alpha$-$T_3$ model extrapolates between the pseudospin $S=1/2$\nhoneycomb lattice of graphene and the pseudospin $S=1$ dice lattice via\nparameter $\\alpha$. We present calculations of the magnetic properties of this\nhybrid pseudospin model, namely the absorptive magneto-optical conductivity and\nthe Hofstadter butterfly spectra. In the magneto-optics curves, signatures of\nthe hybrid system corollary a doublet structure present in the peaks, resulting\nfrom differing Landau level energies in the $K$ and $K^{\\prime}$ valleys. In\nthe Hofstadter spectra, we detail the evolution of the Hofstadter butterfly as\nit changes its periodicity by a factor of three as we vary between the two\nlimiting cases of the $\\alpha$-$T_3$ model.\n", "  We use virial series to study the equilibrium properties of confined\nsoft-spheres fluids interacting through the inverse-power potentials. The\nconfinement is induced by hard walls with planar, spherical and cylindrical\nshapes. We evaluate analytically the coefficients of order two in density of\nthe wall-fluid surface tension $\\gamma$ and analyze the curvature contributions\nto the free energy. Emphasis is in bending and Gaussian rigidities, which are\nfound analytically at order two in density. Their contribution to $\\gamma(R)$\nand the accuracy of different truncation procedures to the low curvature\nexpansion are discussed. Finally, several universal relations that apply to\nlow-density fluids are analyzed.\n", "  We investigate the symmetry property and the stability of dibaryons\ncontaining two strange quarks and one heavy flavor with $I=\\frac{1}{2}$. We\nconstruct the wave function of the dibaryon in two ways. First, we directly\nconstruct the color and spin state of the dibaryon starting from the four\npossible SU(3) flavor state. Second, we consider the states composed of five\nlight quarks, and then construct the wave function of the dibaryon by adding\none heavy quark. The stability of the dibaryon against the strong decay into\ntwo baryons is discussed by using variational method in a constituent quark\nmodel with confining and hyperfine potential. We find that for all\nconfigurations with S=0,1,2, the ground states of the dibaryons are the sum of\ntwo baryons, and there are no compact bound state that is stable against the\nstrong decay.\n", "  We present a sample of 18 optically-selected and X-ray detected spatially\noffset active galactic nuclei (AGN) from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS).\nIn 9 systems, the X-ray AGN is spatially offset from the galactic stellar core\nthat is located within the 3'' diameter SDSS spectroscopic fiber. In 11\nsystems, the X-ray AGN is spatially offset from a stellar core that is located\noutside the fiber, with an overlap of 2. To build the sample, we cross-matched\nType II AGN selected from the SDSS galaxy catalogue with archival Chandra\nimaging and employed our custom astrometric and registration procedure. The\nprojected angular (physical) offsets span a range of 0.\"6 (0.8 kpc) to 17.\"4\n(19.4 kpc), with a median value of 2.\"7 (4.6 kpc). The offset nature of an AGN\nis an unambiguous signature of a galaxy merger, and these systems can be used\nto study the properties of AGN in galaxy mergers without the biases introduced\nby morphological merger selection techniques. In this paper (Paper I), we use\nour sample to assess the kinematics of AGN photoionized gas in galaxy mergers.\nWe find that spectroscopic offset AGN selection may be up to 89% incomplete due\nto small projected velocity offsets. We also find that the magnitude of the\nvelocity offsets are generally larger than expected if our spatial selection\nintroduces a bias toward face-on orbits, suggesting the presence of complex\nkinematics in the emission line gas of AGN in galaxy mergers.\n", "  We address the subject of chiral anomalies in two and four dimensional\ntheories. Ambiguities associated with the $\\gamma_5$ algebra within divergent\nintegrals are identified, even though the physical dimension is not altered in\nthe process of regularization. We present a minimal prescription that leads to\nunique results and apply it to a series of examples. For the particular case of\nabelian theories with effective chiral vertices, we show: 1- Its implication on\nthe way to display the anomalies democratically in the Ward identities. 2- The\npossibility to fix an arbitrary surface term in such a way that a momentum\nrouting independent result emerges. This leads to a reinterpretation of the\nrole of momentum routing in the process of choosing the Ward identity to be\nsatisfied in an anomalous process. 3- Momentum Routing Invariance (MRI) is a\nnecessary and sufficient condition to assure vectorial gauge invariance of\neffective chiral Abelian gauge theories. We also briefly discuss the case of\ncomplete chiral theories, using the Chiral Schwinger Model as an example.\n", "  We provide a simple derivation of particle-vortex duality in d=2+1\ndimensions. Our starting point is a relativistic form of flux attachment,\ndesigned to transmute the statistics of particles. From this seed, we derive a\nweb of new dualities. These include particle-vortex duality for bosons as well\nas the recently discovered counterpart for fermions.\n", "  A new comprehensive analysis of Stefan's flow caused by a free growing\ndroplet in vapor-gas atmosphere with several condensing components is\npresented. This analysis, based on the nonstationary heat and material balance\nand diffusion transport equations, shows the appearance of the Stefan inflow in\nthe vicinity of the growing droplet and the outflow at large distances from the\ndroplet as a consequence of nonisothermal condensation. For an ensemble of\ndroplets in the atmospheric cloud, this flow provides an increase of the total\nvolume of the cloud, which can be treated as cloud thermal expansion and leads\nto floating the cloud as a whole due to buoyancy. We have formulated the\nself-similar solutions of the nonstationary diffusion and heat conduction\nequations for a growing multicomponent droplet and have derived analytical\nexpressions for the nonstationary velocity profile of Stefan's flow and the\nexpansion volume of the vapor-gas mixture around the growing droplet. To\nillustrate the approach, we computed these quantities in the case of droplet of\nstationary composition in air with several specific vapors\n(${\\mathrm{C_2H_5OH/H_2O}}$; ${\\mathrm{H_2SO_4/H_2O}}$; ${\\mathrm{H_2O}}$).\n", "  We study the torsional magneto-elastic oscillations of relativistic\nsuperfluid magnetars and explore the effects of a phase transition in the\ncrust-core interface (nuclear pasta) which results in a weaker elastic\nresponse. Exploring various models with different extension of nuclear pasta\nphases, we find that the differences in the oscillation spectrum present in\npurely elastic modes (weak magnetic field), are smeared out with increasing\nstrength of the magnetic field. For magnetar conditions, the main\ncharacteristic and features of models without nuclear pasta are preserved. We\nfind in general two classes of magneto-elastic oscillations which exhibit a\ndifferent oscillation pattern. For B_p < 4 x 10^{14} G, the spectrum is\ncharacterised by the turning points and edges of the continuum which are\nconfined into the star's core, and have no constant phase. Increasing the\nmagnetic field, we find, in addition, several magneto-elastic oscillations\nwhich reach the surface and have an angular structure similar to crustal modes.\nThese global magneto-elastic oscillations show a constant phase and become\ndominant when B_p > 5 x 10^{14} G. We do not find any evidence of fundamental\npure crustal modes in the low frequency range (below 200 Hz) for B_p >= 10^{14}\nG.\n", "  We study the large deviations of the time-integrated current for a driven\ndiffusion on the circle, often used as a model of nonequilibrium systems. We\nobtain the large deviation functions describing the current fluctuations using\na Fourier-Bloch decomposition of the so-called tilted generator and also\nconstruct from this decomposition the effective (biased, auxiliary or driven)\nMarkov process describing the diffusion as current fluctuations are observed in\ntime. This effective process provides a clear physical explanation of the\nvarious fluctuation regimes observed. It is used here to obtain an upper bound\non the current large deviation function, which we compare to a recently-derived\nentropic bound, and to study the low-noise limit of large deviations.\n", "  Heartbeat stars (HB stars) are a class of eccentric binary stars with close\nperiastron passages. The characteristic photometric HB signal evident in their\nlight curves is produced by a combination of tidal distortion, heating, and\nDoppler boosting near orbital periastron. Many HB stars continue to oscillate\nafter periastron and along the entire orbit, indicative of the tidal excitation\nof oscillation modes within one or both stars. These systems are among the most\neccentric binaries known, and they constitute astrophysical laboratories for\nthe study of tidal effects. We have undertaken a radial velocity (RV)\nmonitoring campaign of Kepler HB stars in order to measure their orbits. We\npresent our first results here, including a sample of 21 Kepler HB systems,\nwhere for 19 of them we obtained the Keplerian orbit and for 3 other systems we\ndid not detect a statistically significant RV variability. Results presented\nhere are based on 218 spectra obtained with the Keck/HIRES spectrograph during\nthe 2015 Kepler observing season, and they have allowed us to obtain the\nlargest sample of HB stars with orbits measured using a single instrument,\nwhich roughly doubles the number of HB stars with an RV measured orbit. The 19\nsystems measured here have orbital periods from 7 to 90 d and eccentricities\nfrom 0.2 to 0.9. We show that HB stars draw the upper envelope of the\neccentricity - period distribution. Therefore, HB stars likely represent a\npopulation of stars currently undergoing high eccentricity migration via tidal\norbital circularization, and they will allow for new tests of high eccentricity\nmigration theories.\n", "  We test the sensitivity of neutrino parameter constraints from combinations\nof CMB and LSS data sets to the assumed form of the primordial power spectrum\n(PPS) using Bayesian model selection. Significantly, none of the tested\ncombinations, including recent high-precision local measurements of\n$\\mathrm{H}_0$ and cluster abundances, indicate a signal for massive neutrinos\nor extra relativistic degrees of freedom. For PPS models with a large, but\nfixed number of degrees of freedom, neutrino parameter constraints do not\nchange significantly if the location of any features in the PPS are allowed to\nvary, although neutrino constraints are more sensitive to PPS features if they\nare known a priori to exist at fixed intervals in $\\log k$. Although there is\nno support for a non-standard neutrino sector from constraints on both neutrino\nmass and relativistic energy density, we see surprisingly strong evidence for\nfeatures in the PPS when it is constrained with data from Planck 2015, SZ\ncluster counts, and recent high-precision local measurements of $\\mathrm{H}_0$.\nConversely combining Planck with matter power spectrum and BAO measurements\nyields a much weaker constraint. Given that this result is sensitive to the\nchoice of data this tension between SZ cluster counts, Planck and\n$\\mathrm{H}_0$ measurements is likely an indication of unmodeled systematic\nbias that mimics PPS features, rather than new physics in the PPS or neutrino\nsector.\n", "  We investigate two stripped-envelope supernovae (SNe) discovered in the\nnearby galaxy NGC 5806 by the (i)PTF. These SNe, designated PTF12os/SN 2012P\nand iPTF13bvn, exploded at a similar distance from the host-galaxy center. We\nclassify PTF12os as a Type IIb SN based on our spectral sequence; iPTF13bvn has\npreviously been classified as Type Ib having a likely progenitor with zero age\nmain sequence (ZAMS) mass below ~17 solar masses. Our main objective is to\nconstrain the explosion parameters of iPTF12os and iPTF13bvn, and to put\nconstraints on the SN progenitors.\n  We present comprehensive datasets on the SNe, and introduce a new\nreference-subtraction pipeline (FPipe) currently in use by the iPTF. We perform\na detailed study of the light curves (LCs) and spectral evolution of the SNe.\nThe bolometric LCs are modeled using the hydrodynamical code HYDE. We use\nnebular models and late-time spectra to constrain the ZAMS mass of the\nprogenitors. We perform image registration of ground-based images of PTF12os to\narchival HST images of NGC 5806 to identify a potential progenitor candidate.\n  Our nebular spectra of iPTF13bvn indicate a low ZAMS mass of ~12 solar masses\nfor the progenitor. The late-time spectra of PTF12os are consistent with a ZAMS\nmass of ~15 solar masses. We successfully identify a progenitor candidate to\nPTF12os using archival HST images. This source is consistent with being a\ncluster of massive stars. Our hydrodynamical modeling suggests that the\nprogenitor of PTF12os had a compact He core with a mass of 3.25 solar masses,\nand that 0.063 solar masses of strongly mixed 56Ni was synthesized. Spectral\ncomparisons to the Type IIb SN 2011dh indicate that the progenitor of PTF12os\nwas surrounded by a hydrogen envelope with a mass lower than 0.02 solar masses.\nWe also find tentative evidence that the progenitor of iPTF13bvn could have\nbeen surrounded by a small amount of hydrogen.\n", "  The interplay between cosmic gas accretion on to galaxies and galaxy mergers\ndrives the observed morphological diversity of galaxies. By comparing the\nstate-of-the-art hydrodynamical cosmological simulations Horizon-AGN and\nHorizon-noAGN, we unambiguously identify the critical role of active galactic\nnuclei (AGN) in setting up the correct galaxy morphology for the massive end of\nthe population. With AGN feedback, typical kinematic and morpho-metric\nproperties of galaxy populations as well as the galaxy-halo mass relation are\nin much better agreement with observations. Only AGN feedback allows massive\ngalaxies at the centre of groups and clusters to become ellipticals, while\nwithout AGN feedback those galaxies reform discs. It is the merger-enhanced AGN\nactivity that is able to freeze the morphological type of the post-merger\nremnant by durably quenching its quiescent star formation. Hence morphology is\nshown to be driven not only by mass but also by the nature of cosmic accretion:\nat constant galaxy mass, ellipticals are galaxies that are mainly assembled\nthrough mergers, while discs are preferentially built from the in situ star\nformation fed by smooth cosmic gas infall.\n", "  A quantum critical (QC) fluid exhibits universal subleading corrections to\nthe area law of its entanglement entropies. In two dimensions when the\npartition involves a corner of angle $\\theta$, the subleading term is\nlogarithmic with coefficient $a_\\alpha(\\theta)$ for the $\\alpha$-R\\'enyi\nentropy. In the smooth limit $\\theta\\!\\to\\!\\pi$, $a_1(\\theta)$ yields the\ncentral charge of the stress tensor when the QC point is described by a\nconformal field theory (CFT). For general R\\'enyi indices and angles,\n$a_\\alpha(\\theta)$ is richer and few general results exist. We study\n$a_\\alpha(\\theta)$ focusing on two benchmark CFTs, the free Dirac fermion and\nboson. We perform numerical lattice calculations to obtain high precision\nresults in $\\theta,\\alpha$ regimes hitherto unexplored. We derive field theory\nestimates for $a_\\alpha(\\theta)$, including new exact results, and demonstrate\nan excellent quantitative match with our numerical calculations. We also\ndevelop and test strong lower bounds, which apply to both free and interacting\nQC systems. Finally, we comment on the near collapse of $a_\\alpha(\\theta)$ for\nvarious theories, including interacting $O(N)$ models.\n", "  Scattering of electromagnetic waves in billiard-like systems has become a\nstandard experimental tool of studying properties associated with Quantum\nChaos. Random Matrix Theory (RMT) describing statistics of eigenfrequencies and\nassociated eigenfunctions remains one of the pillars of theoretical\nunderstanding of quantum chaotic systems. In a scattering system coupling to\ncontinuum via antennae converts real eigenfrequencies into poles of the\nscattering matrix in the complex frequency plane and the associated\neigenfunctions into decaying resonance states. Understanding statistics of\nthese poles, as well as associated non-orthogonal resonance eigenfunctions\nwithin RMT approach is still possible, though much more challenging task.\n", "  Tensor-polarized parton distribution functions are new quantities in spin-one\nhadrons such as the deuteron, and they could probe new quark-gluon dynamics in\nhadron and nuclear physics. In charged-lepton deep inelastic scattering (DIS),\nthey are studied by the twist-two structure functions $b_1$ and $b_2$. The\nHERMES collaboration found unexpectedly large $b_1$ values than a naive\ntheoretical expectation based on the standard deuteron model. The situation\nshould be significantly improved in the near future by an approved experiment\nto measure $b_1$ at JLab (Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility).\nThere is also an interesting indication in the HERMES result that finite\nantiquark tensor polarization exists. It could play an important role in\nsolving a mechanism on tensor structure in the quark-gluon level. The\ntensor-polarized antiquark distributions are not easily determined from the\ncharged-lepton DIS; however, they can be measured in a proton-deuteron\nDrell-Yan process with a tensor-polarized deuteron target. In this article, we\nestimate the tensor-polarization asymmetry for a possible Fermilab\nMain-Injector experiment by using optimum tensor-polarized PDFs to explain the\nHERMES measurement. We find that the asymmetry is typically a few percent. If\nit is measured, it could probe new hadron physics, and such studies could\ncreate an interesting field of high-energy spin physics. In addition, we find\nthat a significant tensor-polarized gluon distribution should exist due to\n$Q^2$ evolution, even if it were zero at a low $Q^2$ scale. The\ntensor-polarized gluon distribution has never been observed, so that it is an\ninteresting future project.\n", "  We study the glass formation in two- and three-dimensional Ising and\nHeisenberg spin systems subject to competing interactions and uniaxial\nanisotropy with a mean-field approach. In three dimensions, for sufficiently\nstrong anisotropy the systems always modulates in a striped phase. Below a\ncritical strength of the anisotropy, a glassy phase exists in a finite range of\ntemperature, and it becomes more stable as the system becomes more isotropic.\nIn two dimension the criticality is always avoided and the glassy phase always\nexists.\n", "  The neutral fermionic edge mode is essential to the non-Abelian topological\nproperty and its experimental detection in $Z_k$ fractional quantum Hall (FQH)\nstate for $k > 1$. Usually, the identification of the edge modes in a finite\nsize system is difficult, especially near the region of the edge\nreconstruction, due to mixing with the bosonic edge mode and the bulk states as\nwell. We study the edge-mode excitations of the Moore-Read (MR) and Read-Rezayi\n(RR) states by using Jack polynomials in the truncated subspace. It is found\nthat the electron density, as a detector, has marked different behaviors\nbetween the bosonic and fermionic edge modes. As an application, it helps us to\nidentify them near the edge reconstruction and in the RR edge spectrum. On the\nother hand, we systematically study the edge excitations for the RR state,\nextrapolate the edge velocities and their related coherence length and\ntemperature in the interferometer experiments.\n", "  Recent advances in the urban science make broad use of the notion of scaling.\nWe focus here on the important scaling relationship between the gross\nmetropolitan product (GMP) of a city and its population (pop). It has been\ndemonstrated that GMP $\\propto$ Y pop $^{\\beta}$ with $\\beta$ always greater\nthan 1 and close to 1.2. This fundamental finding highlights a universal rule\nthat holds across countries and cultures and might explain the very nature of\ncities. However, in an increasingly connected world, the hypothesis that the\neconomy of a city solely depends on its population might be questionable. Using\ndata for 248 cities in the European Union between 2005 and 2010, we found a\ndouble GMP/pop scaling regime. For West EU cities, $\\beta$ = 1 over the whole\nthe period, while for post-communist cities $\\beta >$1 and increases from\n$\\sim$1.2 to $\\sim$1.4. The evolution of the scaling exponent describes the\nconvergence of post-communist European cities to open and liberal economies. We\npropose a simple model of economic convergence in which, under stable political\nconditions, a linear GMP/pop scaling is expected for all cities. The results\nsuggest that the GMP/pop super-linear scaling represents a phase of economic\ngrowth rather than a steady, universal urban feature. The results also suggest\nthat relationships between cities are embedded in their political and economic\ncontext and cannot be neglected in explanations of cities, urbanization and\nurban economics.\n", "  We study the effect of primordial black holes on the classical rate of\nnucleation of AdS regions within the standard electroweak vacuum. We find that\nthe energy barrier for transitions to the new vacuum, which characterizes the\nexponential suppression of the nucleation rate, can be reduced significantly in\nthe black-hole background. A precise analysis is required in order to determine\nwhether the the existence of primordial black holes is compatible with the form\nof the Higgs potential at high temperature or density in the Standard Model or\nits extensions.\n", "  Among a variety of layered materials used as building blocks in van der Waals\nheterostructures, hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) appears as an ideal platform\nfor hosting optically-active defects owing to its large bandgap ($\\sim 6$ eV).\nHere we study the optical response of a high-purity hBN crystal under green\nlaser illumination. By means of photon correlation measurements, we identify\nindividual defects emitting a highly photostable fluorescence under ambient\nconditions. A detailed analysis of the photophysical properties reveals a high\nquantum efficiency of the radiative transition, leading to a single photon\nsource with very high brightness. These results illustrate how the wide range\nof applications offered by hBN could be further extended to photonic-based\nquantum information science and metrology.\n", "  Recent Fermi-LAT observations of dwarf spheroidal galaxies in the Milky Way\nhave placed strong limits on the gamma-ray flux from dark matter annihilation.\nIn order to produce the strongest limit on the dark matter annihilation\ncross-section, the observations of each dwarf galaxy have typically been\n\"stacked\" in a joint-likelihood analysis, utilizing optical observations to\nconstrain the dark matter density profile in each dwarf. These limits have\ntypically been computed only for singular annihilation final states, such as\n$b\\bar{b}$ or $\\tau^+\\tau^-$. In this paper, we generalize this approach by\nproducing an independent joint-likelihood analysis to set constraints on models\nwhere the dark matter particle annihilates to multiple final state fermions. We\ninterpret these results in the context of the most popular simplified models,\nincluding those with s- and t-channel dark matter annihilation through scalar\nand vector mediators. We present our results as constraints on the minimum dark\nmatter mass and the mediator sector parameters. Additionally, we compare our\nsimplified model results to those of Effective Field Theory contact\ninteractions in the high-mass limit.\n", "  Fitting spectral distributions of total fluxes or image intensities are two\nstandard methods for estimating the masses of starless cores and protostellar\nenvelopes. These mass estimates, which are the main source and basis of our\nknowledge of the origin and evolution of self-gravitating cores and protostars,\nare uncertain. In this model-based study, a grid of radiative transfer models\nof starless cores and protostellar envelopes was computed and their total\nfluxes and image intensities were fitted to derive the model masses. To\ninvestigate intrinsic effects related to the physical objects, all\nobservational complications were explicitly ignored. Known true values of the\nnumerical models allow us to assess the qualities of the methods and fitting\nmodels, as well as the effects of nonuniform temperatures, far-infrared opacity\nslope, selected subsets of wavelengths, background subtraction, and angular\nresolutions. The method of fitting image intensities gives more accurate masses\nfor more resolved objects than the method of fitting total fluxes. With the\nlatter, a fitting model that assumes optically thin emission gives much better\nresults than the one allowing substantial optical depths. Temperature excesses\nwithin the objects above the mass-averaged values skew their spectral shapes\ntowards shorter wavelengths, leading to masses underestimated typically by\nfactors 2-5. With a fixed opacity slope deviating from the true value by a\nfactor of 1.2, derived masses are inaccurate within a factor of 2. The most\naccurate masses of the models are estimated by fitting just two or three\nlongest-wavelength fluxes. Conventional algorithm of background subtraction is\na likely source of large systematic errors. The absolute values of masses of\nthe unresolved or poorly resolved objects in star-forming regions are uncertain\nto within at least a factor of 2-3.\n", "  The crossover between a metal and a Mott insulator leads to a localization of\nfermions from delocalized Bloch states to localized states. We experimentally\nstudy this crossover using fermionic atoms in an optical lattice by measuring\nthermodynamic and local (on--site) density correlations. In the metallic phase\nat incommensurable filling we observe the violation of the local\nfluctuation--dissipation theorem indicating that the thermodynamics cannot be\nexplained by local observables. In contrast, in the Mott-insulator we observe\nthe convergence of local and thermodynamic fluctuations indicating the absence\nof long--range density-density correlations.\n", "  Assuming the validity of the relativity principle, we discuss the\nimplications on relativistic kinematics of a deformation of the Poincar\\'e\ninvariance that preserves the Poincar\\'e algebra, and only modifies its action\non phase space in a Lorentz-invariant way. We show that, in contrast to the\ncase where the Poincar\\'e algebra is deformed, the action of boosts on\ntwo-particle states is not affected, while the addition law of momenta is to a\nlarge extent arbitrary. We give some nontrivial examples of this arising from\ndoubly special relativity and noncommutative geometry and show that\nHopf-algebra methods give equivalent results.\n", "  A new approach to construct initial data for binary systems with neutron star\ncomponents is introduced. The approach is a generalization of the puncture\ninitial data method for binary black holes based on Bowen-York solutions to the\nmomentum constraint. As with binary black holes, the method allows setting\norbital configurations with direct input from post-Newtonian approximations and\ninvolves solving only the Hamiltonian constraint. The effectiveness of the\nmethod is demonstrated with evolutions of double neutron star and black hole --\nneutron star binaries in quasi-circular orbits.\n", "  We consider an observable very sensitive to the non-zero intrinsic charm (IC)\ncontribution to the proton density. It is the ratio between the differential\ncross sections of the photon or $Z$-boson and $c$-jet production in the $pp$\ncollision, $\\gamma(Z) + c$, and the $\\gamma(Z)$ and the $b$-jet production. It\nis shown that this ratio can be approximately flat or increasing at large\n$\\gamma(Z)$ transverse momenta $p_T$ and their pseudo-rapidities $1.5 < \\eta <\n2.4$ if the IC contribution is taken into account. On the contrary, in the\nabsence of the IC this ratio decreases as $p_T$ grows. We also present the\nratios of the cross sections integrated over $p_T$ as a function of the IC\nprobability $w$. It is shown that these ratios are mostly independent on the\ntheoretical uncertainties, and such predictions could therefore be much more\npromising for the search for the intrinsic charm signal at the LHC compared to\nthe predictions for $p_T$-spectra, which significantly depend on these\nuncertainties.\n", "  Dark sectors with strong interactions have received considerable interest.\nAssuming the existence of a minimally coupled dark sector which runs to strong\ninteractions in the infrared, we address the question whether the scaling\nbehavior of this dark sector can be observed in missing energy signatures at\npresent and future hadron colliders. We compare these findings to the concrete\ncase of self-interacting dark matter and demonstrate that the energy dependence\nof high-momentum transfer final states can in principle be used to gain\ninformation about the UV structure of hidden sectors at future hadron\ncolliders, subject to large improvements in systematic uncertainties, which\ncould complement proof-of-principle lattice investigations. We also comment on\nthe case of dark Abelian $U(1)$ theories.\n", "  This work reports a peculiar and interesting train of microwave type III pair\nbursts in the impulsive rising phase of a solar flare on 2011 September 26. The\nobservations include radio spectrometers at frequency of 0.80 - 2.00 GHz, hard\nX-ray (RHESSI and FERMI), EUV images of SWAP/PROBA-2 and magnetogram of\nHMI/SDO. By using a recently developed method (Tan et al. 2016a), we diagnosed\nthe plasma density, temperature, plasma beta, magnetic field near the source\nregion, the energy of energetic electrons and the distance between the\nacceleration region and the emission start sites of type III bursts. From the\ndiagnostics, we find that: (1) The plasma density, temperature, magnetic field,\nand the distance between the acceleration region and the emission start sites\nalmost have no obvious variations during the period of type III pair trains,\nwhile the energy of electrons has an obvious peak value which is consistent to\nthe hard X-ray emission. (2) The plasma beta is much higher than an unity\nshowing a highly dynamic process near the emission start site of type III\nbursts. (3) Although the reversed-slope type III branches drift slower at one\norder of magnitude than that of the normal type III branches, the related\ndowngoing and upgoing electrons still could have same order of magnitude of\nenergy. These facts indicate that both of the upgoing and downgoing electrons\nare possibly accelerated by similar mechanism and in a small source region.\nThis diagnostics can help us to understand the microphysics in the source\nregion of solar bursts.\n", "  We present a comparative study of pair correlations and currents through\nsuperconducting-magnetic hybrid systems with a particular emphasis on the\ntunable Bloch domain wall of an exchange spring. This study of the Gor'kov\nfunctions contrasts magnetic systems with domain walls that change at discrete\npoints in the magnetic region with those that change continuously throughout.\nWe present results for misaligned homogeneous magnetic multilayers, including\nspin valves, for discrete domain walls, as well as exchange springs and helical\ndomain walls --such as Holmium-- for the continuous case. Introducing a\nrotating basis to disentangle the role of singlet and triplet correlations, we\ndemonstrate that substantial amounts of (so-called short range) singlet\ncorrelations are generated throughout the magnetic system in a continuous\ndomain wall via the cascade effect. We propose a classification of $0-\\pi$\ntransitions of the Josephson current into three types, according to the\npredominant pair correlations symmetries involved in the current. Properties of\nexchange springs for an experimental study of the proposed effects are\ndiscussed. The interplay between components of the Gor'kov function that are\nparallel and perpendicular to the local magnetization lead to a novel\nprediction about their role in a proximity system with a progressively twisting\nhelix that is experimentally measurable.\n", "  Context: The NIRSpec instrument for the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) can\nbe operated in multiobject (MOS), long-slit, and integral field (IFU) mode with\nspectral resolutions from 100 to 2700. Its MOS mode uses about a quarter of a\nmillion individually addressable minislits for object selection, covering a\nfield of view of $\\sim$9 $\\mathrm{arcmin}^2$. Aims: The pipeline used to\nextract wavelength-calibrated spectra from NIRSpec detector images relies\nheavily on a model of NIRSpec optical geometry. We demonstrate how dedicated\ncalibration data from a small subset of NIRSpec modes and apertures can be used\nto optimize this parametric model to the necessary levels of fidelity. Methods:\nFollowing an iterative procedure, the initial fiducial values of the model\nparameters are manually adjusted and then automatically optimized, so that the\nmodel predicted location of the images and spectral lines from the fixed slits,\nthe IFU, and a small subset of the MOS apertures matches their measured\nlocation in the main optical planes of the instrument. Results: The NIRSpec\nparametric model is able to reproduce the spatial and spectral position of the\ninput spectra with high fidelity. The intrinsic accuracy (1-sigma, RMS) of the\nmodel, as measured from the extracted calibration spectra, is better than 1/10\nof a pixel along the spatial direction and better than 1/20 of a resolution\nelement in the spectral direction for all of the grating-based spectral modes.\nThis is fully consistent with the corresponding allocation in the spatial and\nspectral calibration budgets of NIRSpec.\n", "  In the era of precision neutrino physics, we study the influence of matter\nNSI on the question of neutrino mass ordering and its resolution. At long\nbaseline experiments, since matter effects play a crucial role in addressing\nthis very important question, it is timely to investigate how sub-leading\neffects due to NSI may affect and drastically alter inferences pertaining to\nthis question. We demonstrate that the sensitivity to mass ordering gets\nsignificantly impacted due to NSI effects for various long baseline experiments\nincluding the upcoming long baseline experiment, Deep Underground Neutrino\nExperiment (DUNE). Finally we draw a comparison of DUNE, with the sensitivities\noffered by two of the current neutrino beam experiments NOvA and T2K.\n", "  We have developed a new prior-based source extraction tool, XID+, to carry\nout photometry in the Herschel SPIRE maps at the positions of known sources.\nXID+ is developed using a probabilistic Bayesian framework which provides a\nnatural framework in which to include prior information, and uses the Bayesian\ninference tool, Stan, to obtain the full posterior probability distribution on\nflux estimates. In this paper, we discuss the details of XID+ and demonstrate\nthe basic capabilities and performance by running it on simulated SPIRE maps\nresembling the COSMOS field, and comparing to the current prior-based source\nextraction tool DESPHOT. We show that not only does XID+ perform better on\nmetrics such as flux accuracy and flux uncertainty accuracy, we illustrate how\nobtaining the posterior probability distribution can help overcome some of the\nissues inherent with maximum likelihood based source extraction routines. We\nrun XID+ on the COSMOS SPIRE maps from HerMES, using a 24 $\\mathrm{\\mu m}$\ncatalogue as a prior and show the marginalised SPIRE colour-colour plot and\nmarginalised contribution to the cosmic infrared background at the SPIRE\nwavelengths. XID+ is a core tool arising from the Herschel Extragalactic Legacy\nProject (HELP) and we discuss how additional work within HELP providing prior\ninformation on fluxes can and will be utilised. The software is available at\nhttps://github.com/H-E-L-P/XID_plus. We also provide the data product for\nCOSMOS. We believe this is the first time that the full posterior probability\nof galaxy photometry has been provided as a data product.\n", "  In this paper, we investigate the edge Majorana modes in the simplest\npossible $p{}_{x}+ip_{y}$ superconductor defined on surfaces with different\ngeometry - the annulus, the cylinder, the M\\\"obius band and a cone (by cone we\nmean a cone with the tip cut away so it is topologically equivalent to the\nannulus and cylinder)- and with different configuration of magnetic fluxes\nthreading holes in these surfaces. In particular, we shall address two\nquestions: Given that, in the absence of any flux, the ground state on the\nannulus does not support Majorana modes, while the one on the cylinder does,\nhow is it possible that the conical geometry can interpolate smoothly between\nthe two? Given that in finite geometries edge Majorana modes have to come in\npairs, how can a $p{}_{x}+ip_{y}$ state be defined on a M\\\"obius band, which\nhas only one edge? We show that the key to answering these questions is that\nthe ground state depends on the geometry, even though all the surfaces are\nlocally flat. In the case of the truncated cone, there is a non-trivial\nholonomy, while the non-orientable M\\\"obius band must necessarily support a\ndomain wall.\n", "  Understanding the density structure of the solar corona is important for\nmodeling both coronal heating and the solar wind. Direct measurements are\ndifficult because of line-of-sight integration and possible unresolved\nstructures. We present a new method for quantifying such structure using\ndensity-sensitive EUV line intensities to derive a density irregularity\nparameter, a relative measure of the amount of structure along the line of\nsight. We also present a simple model to relate the inferred irregularities to\nphysical quantities, such as the filling factor and density contrast. For quiet\nSun regions and interplume regions of coronal holes, we find a density contrast\nof at least a factor of three to ten and corresponding filling factors of about\n10-20%. Our results are in rough agreement with other estimates of the density\nstructures in these regions. The irregularity diagnostic provides a useful\nrelative measure of unresolved structure in various regions of the corona.\n", "  The quasar mode of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) in the high-redshift Universe\nis routinely observed in gas-rich galaxies together with large-scale AGN-driven\nwinds. It is crucial to understand how photons emitted by the central AGN\nsource couple to the ambient interstellar-medium to trigger large-scale\noutflows. By means of radiation-hydrodynamical simulations of idealised\ngalactic discs, we study the coupling of photons with the multiphase galactic\ngas, and how it varies with gas cloud sizes, and the radiation bands included\nin the simulations, which are ultraviolet (UV), optical, and infrared (IR). We\nshow how a quasar with a luminosity of $10^{46}$ erg/s can drive large-scale\nwinds with velocities of $10^2-10^3$ km/s and mass outflow rates around $10^3$\nM$_\\odot$/yr for times of order a few million years. Infrared radiation is\nnecessary to efficiently transfer momentum to the gas via multi-scattering on\ndust in dense clouds. However, IR multi-scattering, despite being extremely\nimportant at early times, quickly declines as the central gas cloud expands and\nbreaks up, allowing the radiation to escape through low gas density channels.\nThe typical number of multi-scattering events for an IR photon is only about a\nquarter of the mean optical depth from the center of the cloud. Our models\naccount for the observed outflow rates of $\\sim$500-1000 M$_\\odot$/yr and high\nvelocities of $\\sim 10^3$ km/s, favouring winds that are energy-driven via\nextremely fast nuclear outflows, interpreted here as being\nIR-radiatively-driven winds.\n", "  The Schwinger mechanism of electron-positron pair production in the presence\nof strong external electric fields is analyzed numerically for the case of one-\nand two-dimensional field configurations where the external field depends both\non time and one spatial coordinate. In order to provide this analysis, a new\nefficient numerical approach is developed. The number of particles created is\nobtained numerically and also compared with the analytical results for several\nexactly solvable one-dimensional backgrounds. For the case of two-dimensional\nfield configurations the effects of the spatial finiteness are examined, which\nconfirms their importance and helps us to attest our approach further. The\ncorresponding calculations are also performed for several more interesting and\nnontrivial combinations of temporal and spatial inhomogeneities. Finally, we\ndiscuss the case of a spatially periodic external field when the approach is\nparticularly productive. The method employed is described in detail.\n", "  The topological terms of the bulk effective action for the integer quantum\nHall effect, capturing the dynamics of gauge and gravitational fluctuations,\nreveal a curiosity, namely, the Abelian potential for the magnetic field\nappears in a particular combination with the Abelian spin connection. This\nseems to hold for quantum Hall effect on complex projective spaces of arbitrary\ndimensions. An interpretation of this in terms of the algebra of symplectic\ntransformations is given. This can also be viewed in terms of the metaplectic\ncorrection in geometric quantization.\n", "  We present a precise calculation of spatially-indirect exciton states in\nsemiconductor coupled quantum wells and polaritons formed from their coupling\nto the optical mode of a microcavity. We include the presence of electric and\nmagnetic fields applied perpendicular to the quantum well plane. Our model\npredicts the existence of polaritons which are in the strong coupling regime\nand at the same time possess a large static dipole moment. We demonstrate, in\nparticular, that a magnetic field can compensate for the reduction in\nlight-matter coupling that occurs when an electric field impresses a dipole\nmoment on the polariton.\n", "  We present a rigorous efficient event-chain Monte Carlo algorithm for\nlong-range interacting particle systems. Using a cell-veto scheme within the\nfactorized Metropolis algorithm, we compute each single-particle move with a\nfixed number of operations. For slowly decaying potentials such as Coulomb\ninteractions, screening line charges allow us to take into account periodic\nboundary conditions. We discuss the performance of the cell-veto Monte Carlo\nalgorithm for general inverse-power-law potentials, and illustrate how it\nprovides a new outlook on one of the prominent bottlenecks in large-scale\natomistic Monte Carlo simulations.\n", "  We present B and V time-series photometry of Andromeda XXV, the third galaxy\nin our program on the Andromeda's satellites, that we have imaged with the\nLarge Binocular Cameras of the Large Binocular Telescope. The field of\nAndromeda XXV is found to contain 63 variable stars, for which we present light\ncurves and characteristics of the light variation (period, amplitudes,\nvariability type, mean magnitudes, etc.). The sample includes 58 RR Lyrae\nvariables (46 fundamental-mode $-$ RRab, and 12 first-overtone $-$RRc,\npulsators), three anomalous Cepheids, one eclipsing binary system and one\nunclassified variable. The average period of the RRab stars ($\\langle Pab\n\\rangle$ = 0.60 $\\sigma=0.04$ days) and the period-amplitude diagram place\nAndromeda XXV in the class of the Oosterhoff-Intermediate objects. From the\naverage luminosity of the RR Lyrae stars we derive for the galaxy a distance\nmodulus of (m-M)$_0$=$24.63\\pm0.17$ mag. The color-magnitude diagram reveals\nthe presence in Andromeda XXV of a single, metal-poor ([Fe/H]=$-$1.8 dex)\nstellar population as old as $\\sim$ 10-12 Gyr traced by a conspicuous red giant\nbranch and the large population of RR Lyrae stars. We discovered a\nspherically-shaped high density of stars near the galaxy center. This structure\nappears to be at a distance consistent with Andromeda XXV and we suggest it\ncould either be a star cluster or the nucleus of Andromeda XXV. We provide a\nsummary and compare number and characteristics of the pulsating stars in the\nM31 satellites analyzed so far for variability.\n", "  QCD with gauge group $SU(N_c)$ flows to an interacting conformal fixed point\nin three spacetime dimensions when the number of four-component Dirac fermions\n$N_f \\gg N_c$. We study the stability of this fixed point via the\n$\\epsilon$-expansion about four dimensions. We find that when the number of\nfermions is lowered to $N_f^{\\rm crit} \\approx {11 \\over 2} N_c + (6 + {4 \\over\nN_c}) \\epsilon$, a certain four-fermion operator becomes relevant and the\ntheory flows to a new infrared fixed point (massless or massive). F-theorem or\nentanglement monotonicity considerations complement our $\\epsilon$-expansion\ncalculation.\n", "  Radio and X-ray observations of galaxy clusters probe a direct link between\ncluster mergers and giant radio halos (RH), suggesting that these sources can\nbe used as probes of the cluster merging rate with cosmic time. In this paper\nwe carry out an explorative study that combines the observed fractions of\nmerging clusters (fm) and RH (fRH) with the merging rate predicted by\ncosmological simulations and attempt to infer constraints on merger properties\nof clusters that appear disturbed in X-rays and of clusters with RH. We use\nmorphological parameters to identify merging systems and analyze the currently\nlargest sample of clusters with radio and X-ray data (M500>6d14 Msun, and\n0.2<z<0.33, from the Planck SZ cluster catalogue). We found that in this sample\nfm~62-67% while fRH~44-51%. The comparison of the theoretical f_m with the\nobserved one allows to constrain the combination (xi_m,tau_m), where xi_m and\ntau_m are the minimum merger mass ratio and the timescale of merger-induced\ndisturbance. Assuming tau_m~ 2-3 Gyr, as constrained by simulations, we find\nthat the observed f_m matches the theoretical one for xi_m~0.1-0.18. This is\nconsistent with optical and near-IR observations of clusters in the sample\n(xi_m~0.14-0.16). The fact that RH are found only in a fraction of merging\nclusters may suggest that merger events generating RH are characterized by\nlarger mass ratio; this seems supported by optical/near-IR observations of RH\nclusters in the sample (xi_min~0.2-0.25). Alternatively, RH may be generated in\nall mergers but their lifetime is shorter than \\tau_m (by ~ fRH/fm). This is an\nexplorative study, however it suggests that follow up studies using the\nforthcoming radio surveys and adequate numerical simulations have the potential\nto derive quantitative constraints on the link between cluster merging rate and\nRH at different cosmic epochs and for different cluster masses.\n", "  We report on non-sequential double ionization of Ar by a laser pulse\nconsisting of two counter rotating circularly polarized fields (390 nm and 780\nnm). The double ionization probability depends strongly on the relative\nintensity of the two fields and shows a \"knee\"-like structure as function of\nintensity. We conclude that double ionization is driven by a beam of nearly\nmonoenergetic recolliding electrons, which can be controlled in intensity and\nenergy by the field parameters. The electron momentum distributions show the\nrecolliding electron as well as a second electron which escapes from an\nintermediate excited state of Ar$^+$.\n", "  In the conventional theory of density wave ordering in metals, the onset of\nspin density wave (SDW) order co-incides with the reconstruction of the Fermi\nsurfaces into small 'pockets'. We present models which display this transition,\nwhile also displaying an alternative route between these phases via an\nintermediate phase with topological order, no broken symmetry, and pocket Fermi\nsurfaces. The models involve coupling emergent gauge fields to a fractionalized\nSDW order, but retain the canonical electron operator in the underlying\nHamiltonian. We establish an intimate connection between the suppression of\ncertain defects in the SDW order, and the presence of Fermi surface sizes\ndistinct from the Luttinger value in Fermi liquids. We discuss the relevance of\nsuch models to the physics of the hole-doped cuprates near optimal doping.\n", "  We study the fusion processes $W^-W^+\\to t\\bar t$ and $ZZ\\to t\\bar t$\nobservable at a future $e^-e^+$ collider and we discuss their sensitivity to an\n$Htt$ form factor which may be due to compositeness, in particular when the $H$\nand the top quark have common constituents. We make an amplitude analysis and\nillustrate which helicity amplitudes and cross sections for specific final\n$t\\bar t$ polarizations are especially sensitive to this form factor.\n", "  Basing on the observation of a new $J^{PC}=0^{-+}$ state, $X(2500)$, in the\npartial wave analysis of the decay $J/\\psi\\rightarrow\\gamma X\\rightarrow\n\\gamma\\phi\\phi$ performed by the BESIII Collaboration, we have evaluated the\nstrong decays of the $X(2500)$ as the $4^1S_0$ and $5^1S_0$ $s\\bar{s}$ states\nin the $^3P_0$ meson decay model. The predicted total decay width for the\n$4^1S_0$ $s\\bar{s}$ is about 894.5 MeV, and the one for the $5^1S_0$ $s\\bar{s}$\nis about 271.1 MeV, which is in agreement with the experimental data\n$\\Gamma_{X(2500)}=230^{+64+56}_{-35-33}$ MeV. By considering the mass and the\ntotal strong decay width of the $X(2500)$, we propose that the $X(2500)$ state\ncan be interpreted as a candidate of the $5^1S_0$ $s\\bar{s}$ state.\n", "  We exploit the high spatial resolution and high cadence of the Interface\nRegion Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) to investigate the response of the\ntransition region and chromosphere to energy deposition during a small flare.\nSimultaneous observations from RHESSI provide constraints on the energetic\nelectrons precipitating into the flare footpoints while observations of XRT,\nAIA, and EIS allow us to measure the temperatures and emission measures from\nthe resulting flare loops. We find clear evidence for heating over an extended\nperiod on the spatial scale of a single IRIS pixel. During the impulsive phase\nof this event the intensities in each pixel for the Si IV 1402.770, C II\n1334.535, Mg II 2796.354 and O I 1355.598 emission lines are characterized by\nnumerous, small-scale bursts typically lasting 60s or less. Red shifts are\nobserved in Si IV, C II, and Mg II during the impulsive phase. Mg II shows\nred-shifts during the bursts and stationary emission at other times. The Si IV\nand C II profiles, in contrast, are observed to be red-shifted at all times\nduring the impulsive phase. These persistent red-shifts are a challenge for\none-dimensional hydrodynamic models, which predict only short-duration\ndownflows in response to impulsive heating. We conjecture that energy is being\nreleased on many small-scale filaments with a power-law distribution of heating\nrates.\n", "  We construct an exact map between a tight-binding model on any bipartite\nlattice in presence of dephasing noise and a Hubbard model with imaginary\ninteraction strength. In one dimension, the exact many-body Liouvillian\nspectrum can be obtained by application of the Bethe ansatz method. We find\nthat both the non-equilibrium steady state and the leading decay modes\ndescribing the relaxation at late times are related to the eta-pairing symmetry\nof the Hubbard model. We show that there is a remarkable relation between the\ntime-evolution of an arbitrary k-point correlation function in the dissipative\nsystem and k-particle states of the corresponding Hubbard model.\n", "  The interference between Cabibbo-favoured and Cabibbo-suppressed $B\\to D\\pi$\ndecay amplitudes provides sensitivity to the CKM angle $\\gamma$. The relative\nsize of the interfering amplitudes is an important ingredient in the\ndetermination of $\\gamma$. Using branching fractions from various $B\\to Dh$\ndecays, and the measured value for $r_{B}^{DK}$, the magnitude of the amplitude\nratio of $B^+\\to D^0\\pi^+$ and $B^+\\to \\bar{D}^0\\pi^+$ decays is estimated to\nbe $r_{B}^{D\\pi} = 0.0053 \\pm 0.0007$.\n", "  We evaluate the LHC's potential of observing Higgs boson decays into light\nelementary or composite resonances through their hadronic decay channels. We\nfocus on the Higgs boson production processes with the largest cross sections,\n$pp\\to h$ and $pp\\to h+\\mathrm{jet}$, with subsequent decays $h \\to ZA$ or\n$h\\to Z\\,\\eta_c$, and comment on the production process $pp\\to hZ$. By\nexploiting track-based jet substructure observables and extrapolating to\n$3000~\\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$ we find ${\\cal BR}(h \\to ZA) \\simeq {\\cal BR}(h \\to Z\n\\eta_c) \\lesssim 0.02$ at 95% CL. We interpret this limit in terms of the 2HDM\nType 1. We find that searches for $h\\to ZA$ are complementary to existing\nmeasurements and can constrain large parts of the currently allowed parameter\nspace.\n", "  Hypervelocity stars (HVSs) that are observed in the Galactic halo, are\nbelieved to be accelerated to large velocities by a process of tidal disruption\nof binary stars passing close to a supermassive black hole (SMBH) which resides\nin the center of the Galaxy. It is, however, still unclear, where these\nrelatively young stars were born and which dynamical process pushed them to\nnearly radial orbits around the SMBH. In this paper we investigate the\npossibility that the young binaries originated from a thin eccentric disc,\nsimilar to the one observed in the Galactic center nowadays. By means of direct\nN-body simulations, we follow the dynamical evolution of an initially thin and\neccentric disc of stars with a 100% binary fraction orbiting around the SMBH.\nSuch a configuration leads to Kozai-Lidov oscillations of orbital elements,\nbringing considerable amount of binaries to close vicinity of the black hole.\nSubsequent tidal disruption of these binaries accelerates one of their\ncomponent to velocities well above the escape velocity from the SMBH while the\nsecond component becomes tightly bound to the SMBH. We describe the main\nkinematic properties of the escaping and tightly bound stars within our model\nand compare them qualitatively to the properties of the observed HVSs and\nS-stars, respectively. The most prominent feature is a strong anisotropy in the\ndirections of the escaping stars which is observed for the Galactic HVSs but\nnot explained yet.\n", "  Aims. We aim to probe the internal structure and investigate more detailed\ninformation of the $\\delta$ Scuti star HD 50844 with asteroseismology. Methods.\nWe analyse the observed frequencies of the $\\delta$ Scuti star HD 50844\nobtained by Balona (2014), and search for possible multiplets based on the\nrotational splitting law of g-mode. We tried to disentangle the frequency\nspectra of HD 50844 by means of the rotational splitting only. We then compare\nthem with theoretical pulsation modes, which correspond to stellar evolutionary\nmodels with various sets of initial metallicity and stellar mass, to find the\nbest-fitting model. Results. There are three multiplets including two complete\ntriplets and one incomplete quintuplet, in which mode identifications for\nspherical harmonic degree $l$ and azimuthal number $m$ are unique. The\ncorresponding rotational period of HD 50844 is found to be\n2.44$^{+0.13}_{-0.08}$ days. The physical parameters of HD 50844 are well\nlimited in a small region by three modes identified as nonradial ones\n($f_{11}$, $f_{22}$, and $f_{29}$) and by the fundamental radial mode\n($f_{4}$). Our results show that the three nonradial modes ($f_{11}$, $f_{22}$,\nand $f_{29}$) are all mixed modes, which mainly represent the property of the\nhelium core. The fundamental radial mode ($f_{4}$) mainly represents the\nproperty of the stellar envelope. In order to fit these four pulsation modes,\nboth the helium core and the stellar envelope must be matched to the actual\nstructure of HD 50844. Finally, the mass of the helium core of HD 50844 is\nestimated to be 0.173 $\\pm$ 0.004 $M_{\\odot}$ for the first time. The physical\nparameters of HD 50844 are determined to be $M=$ 1.81 $\\pm$ 0.01 $M_{\\odot}$,\n$Z=$ 0.008 $\\pm$ 0.001. $T_{\\rm eff}=$ 7508 $\\pm$ 125 K, log$g=$ 3.658 $\\pm$\n0.004, $R=$ 3.300 $\\pm$ 0.023 $R_{\\odot}$, $L=$ 30.98 $\\pm$ 2.39 $L_{\\odot}$.\n", "  CONTEXT. A number of recent papers have claimed the discovery of an X-shape\nstructure in the bulge of our Galaxy in the population of the red clumps.\n  AIMS. We endeavor to analyze the stellar density of bulge stars in the same\nregions using a different stellar population that is characteristic of the\nyoung bulge ($\\lesssim 5$ Gyr). Particularly, we use F0-F5 main-sequence stars\nwith distances derived through photometric parallax.\n  METHODS. We extract these stars from extinction-corrected color-magnitude\ndiagrams in the near-infrared of VISTA-VVV data in some bulge regions and\ncalculate the densities along the line of sight. We take the uncertaintity in\nthe photometric parallax and the contamination of other sources into account,\nand we see that these errors do not avoid the detection of a possible double\npeak along some lines of sight as expected for a X-shape bulge if it existed.\n  RESULTS. Only a single peak in the density distribution along the line of\nsight is observed, so apparently there is no X-shape structure for this\npopulation of stars. Nonetheless, the effects of the dispersion of absolute\nmagnitudes in the selected population might be an alternative explanation,\nalthough in principle these effects are insufficient to explain this lack of\ndouble peak according to our calculations.\n  CONCLUSIONS. The results of the present paper do not demonstrate that\nprevious claims of X-shaped bulge using only red clump stars are incorrect, but\nthere are apparently some puzzling questions if we want to maintain the\nvalidity of both the red-clump results and the results of this paper.\n", "  The spin of a planet or brown dwarf is related to the accretion process, and\ntherefore studying spin can help promote our understanding of the formation of\nsuch objects. We present the projected rotational velocity of the young\nsub-stellar companion GQ Lupi b, along with its barycentric radial velocity.\nThe directly imaged exoplanet or brown dwarf companion joins a small but\ngrowing ensemble of wide-orbit sub-stellar companions with a spin measurement.\nThe GQ Lupi system was observed at high spectral resolution (R ~ 100000), and\nin the analysis we made use of both spectral and spatial filtering to separate\nthe signal of the companion from that of the host star. We detect both CO\n(S/N=11.6) and H2O (S/N=7.7) in the atmosphere of GQ Lupi b by\ncross-correlating with model spectra, and we find it to be a slow rotator with\na projected rotational velocity of $5.3^{+0.9}_{-1.0}$ km/s. The slow rotation\nis most likely due to its young age of < 5 Myr, as it is still in the process\nof accreting material and angular momentum. We measure the barycentric radial\nvelocity of GQ Lupi b to be $2.0 \\pm 0.4$ km/s, and discuss the allowed orbital\nconfigurations and their implications for formation scenarios for GQ Lupi b.\n", "  The far-infrared - radio correlation connects star formation and magnetic\nfields in galaxies, and has been confirmed over a large range of far-infrared\nluminosities. Recent investigations indicate that it may even hold in the\nregime of local dwarf galaxies, and we explore here the expected behavior in\nthe regime of star formation surface densities below 0.1 M_sun kpc^{-2}\nyr^{-1}. We derive two conditions that can be particularly relevant for\ninducing a change in the expected correlation: a critical star formation\nsurface density to maintain the correlation between star formation rate and the\nmagnetic field, and a critical star formation surface density below which\ncosmic ray diffusion losses dominate over their injection via supernova\nexplosions. For rotation periods shorter than 1.5x10^7 (H/kpc)^2 yrs, with H\nthe scale height of the disk, the first correlation will break down before\ndiffusion losses are relevant, as higher star formation rates are required to\nmaintain the correlation between star formation rate and magnetic field\nstrength. For high star formation surface densities Sigma_SFR, we derive a\ncharacteristic scaling of the non-thermal radio to the far-infrared / infrared\nemission with Sigma_SFR^{1/3}, corresponding to a scaling of the non-thermal\nradio luminosity L_s with the infrared luminosity L_{th} as L_{th}^{4/3}. The\nlatter is expected to change when the above processes are no longer steadily\nmaintained. In the regime of long rotation periods, we expect a transition\ntowards a steeper scaling with Sigma_SFR^{2/3}, implying L_s~L_th^{5/3}, while\nthe regime of fast rotation is expected to show a considerably enhanced\nscatter. These scaling relations explain the increasing thermal fraction of the\nradio emission observed within local dwarfs, and can be tested with future\nobservations by the SKA and its precursor radio telescopes.\n", "  We propose a simple left-right symmetric theory where the neutrino masses are\ngenerated at the quantum level. In this context the neutrinos are Majorana\nfermions and the model has the minimal degrees of freedom in the scalar sector\nneeded for symmetry breaking and mass generation. We discuss the lepton number\nviolating signatures with two charged leptons of different flavor and missing\nenergy at the Large Hadron Collider in order to understand the testability of\nthe theory.\n", "  We consider collision of two particles that move in the equatorial plane near\na general stationary rotating axially symmetric extremal black hole. One of\nparticles is critical (with fine-tuned parameters) and moves in the outward\ndirection. The second particle (usual, not fine-tuned) comes from infinity. We\nexamine the efficiency $\\eta $ of the collisional Penrose process. There are\ntwo relevant cases here: (i) a particle falling into a black hole after\ncollision is heavy, (ii) it has a finite mass. We show that the maximum of\n$\\eta $ in case (ii) is less or equal to that in case (i). It is argued that\nfor superheavy particles, the bound applies to nonequatorial motion as well. As\nan example, we analyze collision in the Kerr-Newman background. When the bound\nis the same for processes (i) and (ii), $\\eta =3$ for this metric. For the Kerr\nblack hole, recent results in literature are reproduced.\n", "  Galaxy mergers are expected to play a central role for the evolution of\ngalaxies, and may have a strong impact on their magnetic fields. We present the\nfirst grid-based 3D magneto-hydrodynamical simulations investigating the\nevolution of magnetic fields during merger events. For this purpose, we employ\na simplified model considering the merger event of magnetized gaseous disks in\nthe absence of stellar feedback and without a stellar or dark matter component.\nWe show that our model naturally leads to the production of two peaks in the\nevolution of the average magnetic field strength within 5 kpc, within 25 kpc\nand on scales in between 5 and 25 kpc. The latter is consistent with the peak\nin the magnetic field strength reported by Drzazga et al. (2011) in a merger\nsequence of observed galaxies. We show that the peak on the galactic scale and\nin the outer regions is likely due to geometrical effects, as the core of one\ngalaxy enters the outskirts of the other one. In addition, there is a physical\nenhancement of the magnetic field within the central ~5 kpc, reflecting the\nenhancement in density due to efficient angular momentum transport. We conclude\nthat high-resolution observations of the central regions will be particularly\nrelevant to probe the evolution of magnetic field structures during merger\nevents.\n", "  We discuss the role of diffuse, Mie and cooperative scattering on the\nradiation pressure force acting on the center of mass of a cloud of cold atoms.\nEven though a mean-field Ansatz (the `timed Dicke state'), previously derived\nfrom a cooperative scattering approach, has been shown to agree satisfactorily\nwith experiments, diffuse scattering also describes very well most features of\nthe radiation pressure force on large atomic clouds. We compare in detail an\nincoherent, random walk model for photons and a diffraction approach to the\nmore complete description based on coherently coupled dipoles. We show that a\ncooperative scattering approach, although it provides a quite complete\ndescription of the scattering process, is not necessary to explain the previous\nexperiments on the radiation pressure force.\n", "  We present new Herschel PACS observations of 32 T Tauri stars in the young\n($\\sim$3 Myr) $\\sigma$ Ori cluster. Most of our objects are K & M stars with\nlarge excesses at 24 $\\mu$m. We used irradiated accretion disk models of\nD'Alessio et al. (2006) to compare their spectral energy distributions with our\nobservational data. We arrive at the following six conclusions. (i) The\nobserved disks are consistent with irradiated accretion disks systems. (ii)\nMost of our objects (60%) can be explained by significant dust depletion from\nthe upper disk layers. (iii) Similarly, 61% of our objects can be modeled with\nlarge disk sizes ($\\rm R_{\\rm d} \\geq$ 100 AU). (iv) The masses of our disks\nrange between 0.03 to 39 $\\rm M_{Jup}$, where 35% of our objects have disk\nmasses lower than 1 Jupiter. Although these are lower limits, high mass ($>$\n0.05 M$_{\\odot}$) disks, which are present e.g, in Taurus, are missing. (v) By\nassuming a uniform distribution of objects around the brightest stars at the\ncenter of the cluster, we found that 80% of our disks are exposed to external\nFUV radiation of $300 \\leq G_{0} \\leq 1000$, which can be strong enough to\nphotoevaporate the outer edges of the closer disks. (vi) Within 0.6 pc from\n$\\sigma$ Ori we found forbidden emission lines of [NII] in the spectrum of one\nof our large disk (SO662), but no emission in any of our small ones. This\nsuggests that this object may be an example of a photoevaporating disk.\n", "  With the advent of new and more sensitive direct detection experiments, scope\nfor a thermal WIMP explanation of dark matter (DM) has become extremely\nconstricted. The non-observation of thermal WIMP in these experiments has put a\nstrong upper bound on WIMP-nucleon scattering cross section and within a few\nyears it is likely to touch the neutrino floor. Hence in all probability, DM\nmay have some non-thermal origin. In this work we explore in detail this\npossibility of a non-thermal sterile neutrino DM within the framework of\nU(1)$_{\\rm B-L}$ model. The U(1)$_{\\rm B-L}$ model on the other hand is a\nwell-motivated and minimal way of extending the standard model so that it can\nexplain the neutrino masses via Type-I see-saw mechanism. We have shown,\nbesides explaining the neutrino mass, it can also accommodate a non-thermal\nsterile neutrino DM with correct relic density. In contrast with the existing\nliterature, we have found that $W^\\pm$ decay can also be a dominant production\nmode of the sterile neutrino DM. To obtain the comoving number density of dark\nmatter, we have solved here a coupled set of Boltzmann equations considering\nall possible decay as well as annihilation production modes of the sterile\nneutrino dark matter. The framework developed here though has been done for a\nU(1)$_{\\rm B-L}$ model, can be applied quite generally for any models with an\nextra neutral gauge boson and a fermionic non-thermal dark matter.\n", "  We suggest an optical method which tests a nonclassical feature with a\ncoherent state input. The test is designed with a multiplexer of on/off\ndetectors and post-selection, adopting sub-binomiality as a nonclassical\nfeature, replacing Mandel's $Q$-factor. The sub-binomiality is shown negative\neven for coherent states when the post-selection is made. However, we show that\nit can be reproduced also by a classical model assuming a stochastic on/off\ndetectors. In the sense, the sub-binomiality is unlikely to identify the\ngenuine nonclassicality. On the other hand, we propose a coincident probability\nof first two branches of the multiplexer and show that the classical model\nfails to reproduce the quantum coincident probability. The failure of the\nclassical model results from the classical description of light, i.e. the\ndivisibility of intensity into parts no matter how small it is. Then our\noptical test identifies a nonclassical feature of coherent states against the\nclassical divisibility of light, which we call irreducibility.\n", "  We expound in detail the degeneracy between the octant of $\\theta_{23}$ and\nflavor-changing neutral-current non-standard interactions (NSI's) in neutrino\npropagation, considering the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) as a\ncase study. In the presence of such NSI parameters involving the $e-\\mu$\n($\\varepsilon_{e\\mu}$) and $e-\\tau$ ($\\varepsilon_{e\\tau}$) flavors, the\n$\\nu_\\mu \\to \\nu_e$ and $\\bar\\nu_\\mu \\to \\bar\\nu_e$ appearance probabilities in\nlong-baseline experiments acquire an additional interference term, which\ndepends on one new dynamical CP-phase $\\phi_{e\\mu/e\\tau}$. This term sums up\nwith the well-known interference term related to the standard CP-phase $\\delta$\ncreating a source of confusion in the determination of the octant of\n$\\theta_{23}$. We show that for values of the NSI coupling (taken one\nat-a-time) as small as $few\\,\\%$ (relative to the Fermi coupling constant\n$G_{\\mathrm F}$), and for unfavorable combinations of the two CP-phases\n$\\delta$ and $\\phi_{e\\mu/e\\tau}$, the discovery potential of the octant of\n$\\theta_{23}$ gets completely lost.\n", "  We demonstrate simultaneous electromagnetically-induced transparency (EIT)\nwith cesium (Cs) and rubidium (Rb) Rydberg atoms in the same vapor cell with\ncoincident (overlapping) optical fields. Each atomic system can detect radio\nfrequency (RF) electric (E) field strengths through modification of the EIT\nsignal (Autler-Townes (AT) splitting), which leads to a direct SI traceable RF\nE-field measurement. We show that these two systems can detect the same the RF\nE-field strength simultaneously, which provides a direct in situ comparison of\nRb and Cs RF measurements in Rydberg atoms. In effect, this allows us to\nperform two independent measurements of the same quantity in the same\nlaboratory, providing two different immediate and independent measurements.\nThis gives two measurements that helps rule out systematic effects and\nuncertainties in this E-field metrology approach, which are important when\nestablishing an international measurement standard for an E-field strength and\nis a necessary step for this method to be accepted as a standard calibration\ntechnique. We use this approach to measure E-fields at 9.2~GHz, 11.6~GHz, and\n13.4~GHz, which correspond to three different atomic states (different\nprincipal atomic numbers and angular momentums) for the two atom species.\n", "  Using the perturbative scaling and the NRG, we study the characteristic\nenergy scales in the Kondo impurity problem as a function of the exchange\ncoupling constant $J$ and the conduction electron density. We discuss the\nrelation between the impurity binding energy $\\Delta E$ and the Kondo\ntemperature $T_K$. We find that the two are proportional only for large values\nof $J$, whereas in the weak-coupling limit the energy gain is quadratic in $J$,\nwhile the Kondo temperature is exponentially small. The exact relation between\nthe two quantities depends on the detailed form of the density of states of the\nband. In the limit of low electron density the Kondo screening is affected by\nthe strong particle-hole asymmetry due to the presence of the band-edge van\nHove singularities. We consider the cases of 1D, 2D, and 3D tight-binding\nlattices with inverse-square-root, step function, and square-root onsets of the\ndensity of states that are characteristic of the respective dimensionalities.\nWe always find two different regimes depending on whether $T_K$ is higher or\nlower than $\\mu$, the chemical potential measured from the bottom of the band.\nFor 2D and 3D, we find a sigmoidal cross-over between the large-$J$ and\nsmall-$J$ asymptotics in $\\Delta E$, and a clear separation between $\\Delta E$\nand $T_K$ for $T_K < \\mu$. For 1D, there is in addition a sizable\nintermediate-$J$ regime where the Kondo temperature is quadratic in $J$ due to\nthe diverging density of states at the band edge. Furthermore, we find that in\n1D the particle-hole asymmetry leads to a large decrease of $T_K$ compared to\nthe standard result obtained by approximating the density of states to be\nconstant (flat-band approximation), while in 3D the opposite is the case; this\nis due to the non-trivial interplay of the exchange and potential scattering\nrenormalization in the presence of particle-hole asymmetry.\n", "  The structure of interstellar medium can be characterised at large scales in\nterms of its global statistics (e.g. power spectra) and at small scales by the\nproperties of individual cores. Interest has been increasing in structures at\nintermediate scales, resulting in a number of methods being developed for the\nanalysis of filamentary structures. We describe the application of the generic\ntemplate-matching (TM) method to the analysis of maps. Our aim is to show that\nit provides a fast and still relatively robust way to identify elongated\nstructures or other image features. We present the implementation of a TM\nalgorithm for map analysis. The results are compared against rolling Hough\ntransform (RHT), one of the methods previously used to identify filamentary\nstructures. We illustrate the method by applying it to Herschel surface\nbrightness data. The performance of the TM method is found to be comparable to\nthat of RHT but TM appears to be more robust regarding the input parameters,\nfor example, those related to the selected spatial scales. Small modifications\nof TM enable one to target structures at different size and intensity levels.\nIn addition to elongated features, we demonstrate the possibility of using TM\nto also identify other types of structures. The TM method is a viable tool for\ndata quality control, exploratory data analysis, and even quantitative analysis\nof structures in image data.\n", "  The inclusive gluon production at midrapidities is described in the Color\nGlass Condensate formalism using the $k_T$ - factorization formula, which was\nderived at fixed coupling constant considering the scattering of a dilute\nsystem of partons with a dense one. Recent analysis demonstrated that this\napproach provides a satisfactory description of the experimental data for the\ninclusive hadron production in $pp/pA/AA$ collisions. However, these studies\nare based on the fixed coupling $k_T$ - factorization formula, which does not\ntake into account the running coupling corrections, which are important to set\nthe scales present in the cross section. In this paper we consider the running\ncoupling corrected $k_T$ - factorization formula conjectured some years ago and\ninvestigate the impact of the running coupling corrections on the observables.\nIn particular, the pseudorapidity distributions and charged hadrons\nmultiplicity are calculated considering $pp$, $dAu/pPb$ and $AuAu/PbPb$\ncollisions at RHIC and LHC energies. We compare the corrected running coupling\npredictions with those obtained using the original $k_T$ - factorization\nassuming a fixed coupling or a prescription for the inclusion of the running of\nthe coupling. Considering the Kharzeev - Levin - Nardi unintegrated gluon\ndistribution and a simplified model for the nuclear geometry, we demonstrate\nthat the distinct predictions are similar for the pseudorapidity distributions\nin $pp/pA/AA$ collisions and for the charged hadrons multiplicity in $pp/pA$\ncollisions. On the other hand, the running coupling corrected $k_T$ -\nfactorization formula predicts a smoother energy dependence for $dN/d\\eta$ in\n$AA$ collisions.\n", "  The observation of a possible electromagnetic counterpart by the Fermi GBM\ngroup to the aLIGO detection of the merger of a black hole binary has spawned a\nnumber of ideas about its source. Furthermore, observations of fast radio\nbursts (FRBs) have similarly resulted in a range of new models that might endow\nblack hole binaries with electromagnetic signatures. In this context, even the\nunlikely idea that astrophysical black holes may have significant charge is\nworth exploring, and here we present results from the simulation of weakly\ncharged black holes as they orbit and merge. Our simulations suggest that a\nblack hole binary with mass comparable to that observed in GW150914 could\nproduce the level of electromagnetic luminosity observed by Fermi GBM\n($10^{49}$ ergs/s) with a non-dimensional charge of $q \\equiv Q/M = 10^{-4}$\nassuming good radiative efficiency. However even a charge such as this is\ndifficult to imagine avoiding neutralization long enough for the binary to\nproduce its electromagnetic counterpart, and so this value would likely serve\nsimply as an upper bound. On the other hand, one can equivalently consider the\nblack holes as having acquired a magnetic monopole charge that would be easy to\nmaintain and would generate an identical electromagnetic signature as the\nelectric charges. The observation of such a binary would have significant\ncosmological implications, not the least of which would be an explanation for\nthe quantization of charge itself. We also study such a magnetically charged\nbinary in the force-free regime and find it much more radiative, reducing even\nfurther the requirements to produce the counterpart.\n", "  Merging neutron star binaries are prime candidate sources for heavy r-process\nnucleosynthesis. The amount of heavy r-process material is consistent with the\nmass ejection and rates of mergers, and abundances of relic radioactive\nmaterials suggest that heavy r-process material is produced in rare events.\nObservations of possible macronovae provide further support for this model.\nStill, some concerns remain. One is the observation of heavy r-process elements\nin Ultra Faint Dwarf (UFD) galaxies. The escape velocities from UFDs are so\nsmall that the natal kicks, taking place at neutron stars birth, might eject\nsuch binaries from UFDs. Furthermore the old stellar populations of UFDs\nrequires that r-process nucleosynthesis must have taken place very early on,\nwhile it may take several Gyr for compact binaries to merge. This last problem\narises also within the Milky Way where heavy r-process materials has been\nobserved in some low metallicity stars. We show here that since a significant\nfraction of neutron star binaries form with a very small proper motion those\nwon't be ejected even from a UFD. Furthermore, a significant fraction of these\nbinaries merge within a few hundred Myr and in some cases the merger time is\neven shorter than a hundred Myr. This population of \"rapid mergers\" explains\nthe appearance of heavy r-process material in both UFDs and in the Milky Way.\n", "  Properties of bottom and bottom-strange mesons are computed in two\nrelativized quark models. Model masses and wavefunctions are used to predict\nradiative transition rates and the $^3P_0$ quark pair creation model is used to\ncompute strong decay widths. A comparison to recently observed bottom and\nbottom-strange states is made. We find that there are numerous excited $B$ and\n$B_s$ mesons that have relatively narrow widths and significant branching\nratios to simple final states such as $B\\pi$, $B^*\\pi$, $BK$, and $B^*K$ that\ncould be observed in the near future.\n", "  We suggest that the J/psi phi structures observed by LHCb can be fitted in\ntwo tetraquak multiplets, the S-wave ground state and the first radial\nexcitation, with composition [cs][cbar sbar]. When compared to the previously\nidentified [cq][cbar qbar] multiplet, the observed masses agree with what\nexpected for a multiplet with q -->s. We propose the X(4274), fitted by LHCb\nwith a single 1^++ resonance, to correspond rather to two, almost degenerate,\nunresolved lines with J^PC = 0^++, 2^++. Masses of missing particles in the 1S\nand 2S multiplets are predicted.\n", "  We consider the diffusion-advection problem in two simple cellular flow\nmodels (often invoked as examples for subdiffusive tracer's motion) and\nconcentrate on the intermediate time range, in which the tracer's motion indeed\nmay show subdiffusion. We have performed extensive numerical simulations of the\nsystems under different initial conditions, and show that the pure\nintermediate-time subdiffusion regime is only evident when the particles start\nat the border between different cells, i.e. at the separatrix, and is less\npronounced or absent for other initial conditions. The motion moreover shows\nquite peculiar aging properties which are also mirrored in the behavior of the\ntime-averaged mean squared displacement for single trajectories. This kind of\nbehavior is due to the complex motion of tracers trapped inside the cell, and\nis absent in classical models based on continuous time random walks (CTRW) with\nno dynamics in the trapped state.\n", "  Intermediate polars with known rates of spin period changes are not numerous\nbecause such tasks require measurements performed for a long time. To measure a\nspin period change, MU Cam is a good candidate because it has a spin\noscillation with a large amplitude enabling measurements with high precision.\nFortunately, in the past the spin period of MU Cam was measured with high\nprecision. To measure the spin period anew, in 2014-2015 we performed extensive\nphotometric observations of MU Cam, spanning a total duration of 208 h within\n46 nights. We found that the spin, sideband and orbital periods are equal to\n1187.16245+/-0.00047 s, 1276.3424+/-0.0022 s and 4.71942+/-0.00016 h,\nrespectively. Comparing the measured spin period with the spin period of MU Cam\nin the past, we detected the spin period change with dP/dt=-(2.17+/-0.10) X\n10^(-10). This rate of the spin period change was not stable and varied in a\ntime scale of years. During four nights in 2014 April-May MU Cam was fainter\nthan usual by 0.8 mag, and the amplitude of the sideband oscillation was five\ntimes larger, denoting significant fraction of disc-overflow accretion. The\nsideband oscillation showed a double-peaked pulse profile in the normal\nbrightness state. When the star brightness was decreased by 0.8 mag, the\nsideband oscillation showed a single-peaked pulse profile. In contrast, the\nspin pulse, which was quasi-sinusoidal, remained remarkably stable both in\nprofile and in amplitude. Moreover, the spin pulse was also remarkably stable\nin a time scale of years and even decades. MU Cam is of great interest because\nit represents a distinctive object with a large and unstable rate of the spin\nperiod change and exhibits a distinctive behaviour of the pulse profiles.\n", "  Molecular adsorbates on metal surfaces exchange energy with substrate phonons\nand low-lying electron-hole pair excitations. In the limit of weak coupling,\nelectron-hole pair excitations can be seen as exerting frictional forces on\nadsorbates that enhance energy transfer and facilitate vibrational relaxation\nor hot-electron mediated chemistry. We have recently reported on the relevance\nof tensorial properties of electronic friction [Phys. Rev. Lett. 116, 217601\n(2016)] in dynamics at surfaces. Here we present the underlying implementation\nof tensorial electronic friction based on Kohn-Sham Density Functional Theory\nfor condensed phase and cluster systems. Using local atomic-orbital basis sets,\nwe calculate nonadiabatic coupling matrix elements and evaluate the full\nelectronic friction tensor in the classical limit. Our approach is numerically\nstable and robust as shown by a detailed convergence analysis. We furthermore\nbenchmark the accuracy of our approach by calculation of vibrational relaxation\nrates and lifetimes for a number of diatomic molecules at metal surfaces. We\nfind friction-induced mode-coupling between neighboring CO adsorbates on\nCu(100) in a c(2x2) overlayer to be important to understand experimental\nfindings.\n", "  We analyse new observations with the International Low Frequency Array\n(LOFAR) telescope, and archival data from the Multi-Element Radio Linked\nInterferometer Network (MERLIN) and the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA).\nWe model the spatially resolved radio spectrum of Arp 220 from 150 MHz to 33\nGHz. We present an image of Arp 220 at 150 MHz with resolution\n$0.65''\\times0.35''$, sensitivity 0.15 mJy beam$^{-1}$, and integrated flux\ndensity $394\\pm59$ mJy. More than 80% of the detected flux comes from extended\n($6''\\approx$2.2 kpc) steep spectrum ($\\alpha=-0.7$) emission, likely from star\nformation in the molecular disk surrounding the two nuclei. We find elongated\nfeatures extending $0.3''$ (110 pc) and $0.9''$ (330 pc) from the eastern and\nwestern nucleus respectively, which we interpret as evidence for outflows. The\nextent of radio emission requires acceleration of cosmic rays far outside the\nnuclei. We find that a simple three component model can explain most of the\nobserved radio spectrum of the galaxy. When accounting for absorption at 1.4\nGHz, Arp 220 follows the FIR/radio correlation with $q=2.36$, and we estimate a\nstar formation rate of 220 M$_\\odot\\text{yr}^{-1}$. We derive thermal fractions\nat 1 GHz of less than 1% for the nuclei, which indicates that a major part of\nthe UV-photons are absorbed by dust. International LOFAR observations shows\ngreat promise to detect steep spectrum outflows and probe regions of thermal\nabsorption. However, in LIRGs the emission detected at 150 MHz does not\nnecessarily come from the main regions of star formation. This implies that\nhigh spatial resolution is crucial for accurate estimates of star formation\nrates for such galaxies at 150 MHz.\n", "  Solar prominences are subject to both field-aligned (longitudinal) and\ntransverse oscillatory motions, as evidenced by an increasing number of\nobservations. Large-amplitude longitudinal motions provide valuable information\non the geometry of the filament-channel magnetic structure that supports the\ncool prominence plasma against gravity. Our pendulum model, in which the\nrestoring force is the gravity projected along the dipped field lines of the\nmagnetic structure, best explains these oscillations. However, several factors\ncan influence the longitudinal oscillations, potentially invalidating the\npendulum model. The aim of this work is to study the influence of large-scale\nvariations in the magnetic field strength along the field lines, i.e.,\nvariations of the cross-sectional area along the flux tubes supporting\nprominence threads. We studied the normal modes of several flux tube\nconfigurations, using linear perturbation analysis, to assess the influence of\ndifferent geometrical parameters on the oscillation properties. We found that\nthe influence of the symmetric and asymmetric expansion factors on longitudinal\noscillations is small.}{We conclude that the longitudinal oscillations are not\nsignificantly influenced by variations of the cross-section of the flux tubes,\nvalidating the pendulum model in this context.\n", "  We analyze the equations of quantum electrodynamics and establish that the\nelectron must be described by two bispinors that satisfy two mutually connected\nDirac equations. The equations of the electronic and electromagnetic fields are\nreformulated in terms of c-numbers, which enables one to elucidate the\nstructure of the electron. Although the equations obtained allow only for\nnumerical solution, some characteristics of the electron, in particular its\nsize, can be found at this stage. It is shown also that the Dirac equation\nshould, instead of the mass of the electron, contain a combination involving\nthe electron Compton wavelength. In this case the equations obtained can be\nused not only for the description of the electron but also for the description\nof other leptons, which will allow one to find the mass spectrum of leptons.\n", "  Known entropy bounds, and the Generalized Second Law, were recently shown to\nimply bounds on the information arriving at future null infinity. We complete\nthis derivation by including the contribution from gravitons. We test the\nbounds in classical settings with gravity and no matter. In Minkowski space,\nthe bounds vanish on any subregion of the future boundary, independently of\ncoordinate choices. More generally, the bounds vanish in regions where no\ngravitational radiation arrives. In regions that do contain Bondi news, the\nbounds are compatible with the presence of information, including the\ninformation stored in gravitational memory. All of our results are consistent\nwith the equivalence principle, which states that empty Riemann-flat spacetime\nregions contain no classical information. We also discuss the possibility that\nMinkowski space has an infinite vacuum degeneracy labeled by a choice of Bondi\ncoordinates (a classical parameter, if physical). We argue that this degeneracy\ncannot have any observational consequences if the equivalence principle holds.\nOur bounds are consistent with this conclusion.\n", "  We analyse the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) signal of the final Baryon\nOscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) data release (DR12). Our analysis is\nperformed in Fourier-space, using the power spectrum monopole and quadrupole.\nThe dataset includes $1\\,198\\,006$ galaxies over the redshift range $0.2 < z <\n0.75$. We divide this dataset into three (overlapping) redshift bins with the\neffective redshifts $\\zeff = 0.38$, $0.51$ and $0.61$. We demonstrate the\nreliability of our analysis pipeline using N-body simulations as well as $\\sim\n1000$ MultiDark-Patchy mock catalogues, which mimic the BOSS-DR12 target\nselection. We apply density field reconstruction to enhance the BAO\nsignal-to-noise ratio. By including the power spectrum quadrupole we can\nseparate the line-of-sight and angular modes, which allows us to constrain the\nangular diameter distance $D_A(z)$ and the Hubble parameter $H(z)$ separately.\nWe obtain two independent $1.6\\%$ and $1.5\\%$ constraints on $D_A(z)$ and\n$2.9\\%$ and $2.3\\%$ constraints on $H(z)$ for the low ($\\zeff=0.38$) and high\n($\\zeff=0.61$) redshift bin, respectively. We obtain two independent $1\\%$ and\n$0.9\\%$ constraints on the angular averaged distance $D_V(z)$, when ignoring\nthe Alcock-Paczynski effect. The detection significance of the BAO signal is of\nthe order of $8\\sigma$ (post-reconstruction) for each of the three redshift\nbins. Our results are in good agreement with the Planck prediction within\n$\\Lambda$CDM. This paper is part of a set that analyses the final galaxy\nclustering dataset from BOSS. The measurements and likelihoods presented here\nare combined with others in~\\citet{Alam2016} to produce the final cosmological\nconstraints from BOSS.\n", "  The determination of atmospheric structure and molecular abundances of\nplanetary atmospheres via spectroscopy involves direct comparisons between\nmodels and data. While varying in sophistication, most model-spectra\ncomparisons fundamentally assume \"1D\" model physics. However, knowledge from\ngeneral circulation models and of solar system planets suggests that planetary\natmospheres are inherently \"3D\" in their structure and composition. We explore\nthe potential biases resulting from standard \"1D\" assumptions within a Bayesian\natmospheric retrieval framework. Specifically, we show how the assumption of a\nsingle 1-dimensional thermal profile can bias our interpretation of the thermal\nemission spectrum of a hot Jupiter atmosphere that is composed of two thermal\nprofiles. We retrieve upon spectra of unresolved model planets as observed with\na combination of $HST$ WFC3+$Spitzer$ IRAC as well as $JWST$ under varying\ndifferences in the two thermal profiles. For WFC3+IRAC, there is a\nsignificantly biased estimate of CH$_4$ abundance using a 1D model when the\ncontrast is 80%. For $JWST$, two thermal profiles are required to adequately\ninterpret the data and estimate the abundances when contrast is greater than\n40%. We also apply this preliminary concept to the recent WFC3+IRAC phase curve\ndata of the hot Jupiter WASP-43b. We see similar behavior as present in our\nsimulated data: while the H$_2$O abundance determination is robust, CH$_4$ is\nartificially well-constrained to incorrect values under the 1D assumption. Our\nwork demonstrates the need to evaluate model assumptions in order to extract\nmeaningful constraints from atmospheric spectra and motivates exploration of\noptimal observational setups.\n", "  CONTEXT. Stellar populations are the building blocks of galaxies including\nthe Milky Way. The majority, if not all extragalactic studies are entangled\nwith the use of stellar population models given the unresolved nature of their\nobservation. Extragalactic systems contain multiple stellar populations with\ncomplex star formation histories. However, their study is mainly based upon the\nprinciples of simple stellar populations (SSP). Hence, it is critical to\nexamine the validity of SSP models. AIMS. This work aims to empirically test\nthe validity of SSP models. This is done by comparing SSP models against\nobservations of spatially resolved young stellar population in the\ndetermination of its physical properties, i.e. age and metallicity. METHODS.\nIntegral field spectroscopy of a young stellar cluster in the Milky Way, NGC\n3603, is used to study the properties of the cluster both as a resolved and\nunresolved stellar population. The unresolved stellar population is analysed\nusing the H$\\alpha$ equivalent width as an age indicator, and the ratio of\nstrong emission lines to infer metallicity. In addition, spectral energy\ndistribution (SED) fitting using STARLIGHT, is used to infer these properties\nfrom the integrated spectrum. Independently, the resolved stellar population is\nanalysed using the color-magnitude diagram (CMD) for age and metallicity\ndetermination. As the SSP model represents the unresolved stellar population,\nthe derived age and metallicity are put to test whether they agree with those\nderived from resolved stars. RESULTS. The age and metallicity estimate of NGC\n3603 derived from integrated spectroscopy are confirmed to be within the range\nof those derived from the CMD of the resolved stellar population, including\nother estimates found in the literature. The result from this pilot study\nsupports the reliability of SSP models for studying unresolved young stellar\npopulations.\n", "  A homogeneous search for stellar flares has been performed using every\navailable Kepler light curve. An iterative light curve de-trending approach was\nused to filter out both astrophysical and systematic variability to detect\nflares. The flare recovery completeness has also been computed throughout each\nlight curve using artificial flare injection tests, and the tools for this work\nhave been made publicly available. The final sample contains 851,168 candidate\nflare events recovered above the 68% completeness threshold, which were\ndetected from 4041 stars, or 1.9% of the stars in the Kepler database. The\naverage flare energy detected is ~$10^{35}$ erg. The net fraction of flare\nstars increases with $g-i$ color, or decreasing stellar mass. For stars in this\nsample with previously measured rotation periods, the total relative flare\nluminosity is compared to the Rossby number. A tentative detection of flare\nactivity saturation for low-mass stars with rapid rotation below a Rossby\nnumber of ~0.03 is found. A power law decay in flare activity with Rossby\nnumber is found with a slope of -1, shallower than typical measurements for\nX-ray activity decay with Rossby number.\n", "  We provide further details on a recent proposal addressing the nature of the\ndark sectors in cosmology and demonstrate that all current observations related\nto Dark Matter can be explained by the presence of a heavy spin-2 particle.\nMassive spin-2 fields and their gravitational interactions are uniquely\ndescribed by ghost-free bimetric theory, which is a minimal and natural\nextension of General Relativity. In this setup, the largeness of the physical\nPlanck mass is naturally related to extremely weak couplings of the heavy\nspin-2 field to baryonic matter and therefore explains the absence of signals\nin experiments dedicated to Dark Matter searches. It also ensures the\nphenomenological viability of our model as we confirm by comparing it with\ncosmological and local tests of gravity. At the same time, the spin-2 field\npossesses standard gravitational interactions and it decays universally into\nall Standard Model fields but not into massless gravitons. Matching the\nmeasured DM abundance together with the requirement of stability constrains the\nspin-2 mass to be in the 1 to 100 TeV range.\n", "  We constrain the warm dark matter (WDM) particle mass with the observations\nof cosmic reionization and CMB optical depth. We suggest that the GWs from\nstellar mass black holes (BHs) could give a further constraint on WDM particle\nmass for future observations. The star formation rates (SFRs) of Population\nI/II (Pop I/II) and Population III (Pop III) stars are also derived. If the\nmetallicity of the universe have been enriched beyond the critical value of\n$Z_{\\rm crit}=10^{-3.5}Z_{\\odot}$, the star formation shift from Pop III to Pop\nI/II stars. Our results show that the SFRs are quite dependent on the WDM\nparticle mass, especially at high redshifts. Combing with the reionization\nhistory and CMB optical depth derived from the recent \\emph{Planck} mission, we\nfind that the current data requires the WDM particle mass in a narrow range of\n$1 < m_x < 3$ keV. Furthermore, we suggest that the stochastic gravitational\nwave background (SGWB) produced by stellar BHs could give a further constraint\non the WDM particle mass for future observations. For $m_{x}=3$ keV with\nSalpeter (Chabrier) initial mass function (IMF), the SGWB from Pop I/II BHs has\na peak amplitude of $\\Omega_{\\rm GW}\\approx2.8\\times 10^{-9}~(5.0\\times\n10^{-9})$ at $f= 316 {\\rm Hz}$, while the GW radiation at $f<10$Hz is seriously\nsuppressed. For $m_{\\rm x}=1$ keV, the SGWB peak amplitude is the same as that\nof $m_{\\rm x}=1$ keV, but a little lower at low frequencies. Therefore, it is\nhard to constrain the WDM particle mass by the SGWB from Pop I/II BHs. To\nassess the detectability of GW signal, we also calculate the signal to noise\nratio (SNR), which are $\\rm SNR=37.7~ (66.5)$ and $27~(47.7)$ for $m_{\\rm x}=3$\nkeV and $m_{\\rm x}=1$ keV for Einstein Telescope (ET) with Salpeter (Chabrier)\nIMF, respectively.\n", "  Nuclear rings at centers of barred galaxies exhibit strong star formation\nactivities. They are thought to undergo gravitational instability when\nsufficiently massive. We approximate them as rigidly-rotating isothermal\nobjects and investigate their gravitational instability. Using a\nself-consistent field method, we first construct their equilibrium sequences\nspecified by two parameters: alpha corresponding to the thermal energy relative\nto gravitational potential energy, and R_B measuring the ellipticity or ring\nthickness. Unlike in the incompressible case, not all values of R_B yield an\nisothermal equilibrium, and the range of R_B for such equilibria shrinks with\ndecreasing alpha. The density distributions in the meridional plane are steeper\nfor smaller alpha, and well approximated by those of infinite cylinders for\nslender rings. We also calculate the dispersion relations of nonaxisymmetric\nmodes in rigidly-rotating slender rings with angular frequency Omega_0 and\ncentral density rho_max. Rings with smaller alpha are found more unstable with\na larger unstable range of the azimuthal mode number. The instability is\ncompletely suppressed by rotation when Omega_0 exceeds the critical value. The\ncritical angular frequency is found to be almost constant at ~ 0.7\nsqrt(G*rho_c) for alpha > 0.01 and increases rapidly for smaller alpha. We\napply our results to a sample of observed star-forming rings and confirm that\nrings without a noticeable azimuthal age gradient of young star clusters are\nindeed gravitationally unstable.\n", "  We studied the developing conditions of sigmoid structure under the influence\nof magnetic non-potential characteristics of a rotating sunspot in the active\nregion (AR) 12158. Vector magnetic field measurements from Helioseismic\nMagnetic Imager and coronal EUV observations from Atmospheric Imaging Assembly\nreveal that the erupting inverse-S sigmoid had roots in the location of the\nrotating sunspot. Sunspot rotates at a rate of 0-5deg/h with increasing trend\nin the first half followed by a decrease. Time evolution of many non-potential\nparameters had a well correspondence with the sunspot rotation. The evolution\nof the AR magnetic structure is approximated by a time series of force free\nequilibria. The NLFFF magnetic structure around the sunspot manifests the\nobserved sigmoid structure. Field lines from the sunspot periphery constitute\nthe body of the sigmoid and those from interior overly the sigmoid similar to a\nfluxrope structure. While the sunspot is being rotating, two major CME\neruptions occurred in the AR. During the first (second) event, the coronal\ncurrent concentrations enhanced (degraded) consistent with the photospheric net\nvertical current, however the magnetic energy is released during both the\ncases. The analysis results suggest that the magnetic connections of the\nsigmoid are driven by slow motion of sunspot rotation, which transforms to a\nhighly twisted flux rope structure in a dynamical scenario. An exceeding\ncritical twist in the flux rope probably leads to the loss of equilibrium and\nthus triggering the onset of two eruptions.\n", "  M82 X-1 is one of the brightest ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) known,\nwhich, assuming Eddington-limited accretion and other considerations, makes it\none of the best intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) candidates. However, the\nULX may still be explained by super-Eddington accretion onto a stellar-remnant\nblack hole. We present simultaneous NuSTAR, Chandra and Swift/XRT observations\nduring the peak of a flaring episode with the aim of modeling the emission of\nM82 X-1 and yielding insights into its nature. We find that thin-accretion disk\nmodels all require accretion rates at or above the Eddington limit in order to\nreproduce the spectral shape, given a range of black hole masses and spins.\nSince at these high Eddington ratios the thin-disk model breaks down due to\nradial advection in the disk, we discard the results of the thin-disk models as\nunphysical. We find that the temperature profile as a function of disk radius\n($T(r)\\propto r^{-p}$) is significantly flatter ($p=0.55^{+ 0.07}_{- 0.04}$)\nthan expected for a standard thin disk ($p=0.75$). A flatter profile is instead\ncharacteristic of a slim disk which is highly suggestive of super-Eddington\naccretion. Furthermore, radiation hydrodynamical simulations of super-Eddington\naccretion have shown that the predicted spectra of these systems are very\nsimilar to what we observe for M82 X-1. We therefore conclude that M82 X-1 is a\nsuper-Eddington accretor. Our mass estimates inferred from the inner disk\nradius imply a stellar-remnant black hole ($M_{\\rm BH}=26^{+9}_{-6} M_{\\odot}$)\nwhen assuming zero spin, or an IMBH ($M_{\\rm BH}=125^{+45}_{-30} M_{\\odot}$)\nwhen assuming maximal spin.\n", "  This is the second paper in a series on a new luminous z ~ 5 quasar survey\nusing optical and near-infrared colors. Here we present a new determination of\nthe bright end of the quasar luminosity function (QLF) at z ~ 5. Combined our\n45 new quasars with previously known quasars that satisfy our selections, we\nconstruct the largest uniform luminous z ~ 5 quasar sample to date, with 99\nquasars in the range 4.7 <= z < 5.4 and -29 < M1450 <= -26.8, within the Sloan\nDigital Sky Survey (SDSS) footprint. We use a modified 1/Va method including\nflux limit correction to derive a binned QLF, and we model the parametric QLF\nusing maximum likelihood estimation. With the faint-end slope of the QLF fixed\nas alpha = -2.03 from previous deeper samples, the best fit of our QLF gives a\nflatter bright end slope beta = -3.58+/-0.24 and a fainter break magnitude\nM*1450 = -26.98+/-0.23 than previous studies at similar redshift. Combined with\nprevious work at lower and higher redshifts, our result is consistent with a\nluminosity evolution and density evolution (LEDE) model. Using the best fit\nQLF, the contribution of quasars to the ionizing background at z ~ 5 is found\nto be 18% - 45% with a clumping factor C of 2 - 5. Our sample suggests an\nevolution of radio loud fraction with optical luminosity but no obvious\nevolution with redshift.\n", "  The erasure of a classical bit of information is a dissipative process. The\nminimum heat produced during this operation has been theorized by Rolf Landauer\nin 1961 to be equal to $k_B T \\ln 2$ and takes the name of Landauer limit,\nLandauer reset or Landauer principle. Despite its fundamental importance, the\nLandauer limit remained untested experimentally for more than fifty years until\nrecently when it has been tested using colloidal particles and magnetic dots.\nExperimental measurements on different devices, like micro-mechanical systems\nor nano-electronic devices are still missing. Here we show the results obtained\nin performing the Landauer reset operation in a micro-mechanical system,\noperated at an effective temperature. The measured heat exchange is in\naccordance with the theory reaching values close to the expected limit. The\ndata obtained for the heat production is then correlated to the probability of\nerror in accomplishing the reset operation.\n", "  The role of the Hall term on large scale dynamo action is investigated by\nmeans of the First Order Smoothing Approximation. It is shown that the standard\n$\\alpha$ coefficient is altered, and is zero when a specific double Beltrami\nstate is attained, in contrast to the Alfv\\'enic state for MHD dynamos. The\n$\\beta$ coefficient is no longer positive definite, and thereby enables dynamo\naction even if $\\alpha$-quenching were to operate. The similarities and\ndifferences with the (magnetic) shear-current effect are pointed out, and a\nmechanism that may be potentially responsible for $\\beta < 0$ is advanced. The\nresults are compared against previous studies, and their astrophysical\nrelevance is also highlighted.\n", "  I derive a new MOND relation for pure-disc galaxies: The `dynamical' central\nsurface density, $\\Sigma^0_D$, deduced from the measured velocities, is a\nuniversal function of only the true, `baryonic' central surface density,\n$\\Sigma^0_B$: $\\Sigma^0_D=\\Sigma_M \\mathcal{S}(\\Sigma^0_B/\\Sigma_M)$, where\n$\\Sigma_M\\equiv a_0/2\\pi G$ is the MOND surface density constant. This\nsurprising result is shown to hold in both existing, nonrelativistic MOND\ntheories. $\\mathcal{S}(y)$ is derived: $\\mathcal{S}(y)=\\int_0^y\\nu(y')dy'$,\nwith $\\nu(y)$ the interpolating function of the theory. The relation aymptotes\nto $\\Sigma^0_D=\\Sigma^0_B$ for $\\Sigma^0_B\\gg\\Sigma_M$, and to\n$\\Sigma^0_D=(4\\Sigma_M\\Sigma^0_B)^{1/2}$ for $\\Sigma^0_B\\ll\\Sigma_M$. This\nstudy was prompted by the recent finding of a correlation between related\nattributes of disc galaxies by Lelli et al. (2016). The MOND\ncentral-surface-densities relation agrees very well with these results.\n", "  Metamaterials possess artificial bulk and surface electromagnetic states.\nTamed dispersion properties of surface waves allow one to achieve controllable\nsuper-Planckian radiative heat transfer (RHT) process between two closely\nspaced objects. We numerically demonstrate enhanced RHT between two 2D grooved\nmetal plates by a full-wave scattering approach. The enhancement originates\nfrom both transverse magnetic spoof surface plasmon polaritons and a series of\ntransverse electric bonding- and anti-bonding waveguide modes at surfaces. The\nRHT spectrum is frequency-selective, and highly geometrically tailorable. Our\nsimulation also reveals thermally excited non-resonant surface waves in\nconstituent materials can play a prevailing role for RHT at an extremely small\nseparation between two plates, rendering metamaterial modes insignificant for\nthe energy transfer process.\n", "  We study effective three-particle interactions between valence electrons,\nwhich are induced by the core polarization. Such interactions are enhanced when\nvalence orbitals have strong overlap with the outermost core shell, in\nparticular for the systems with partially filled f-shell. We find that in\ncertain cases the three-particle contributions are large, affecting the order\nof energy levels, and need to be included in high-precision calculations.\n", "  {Observations of the solar atmosphere have shown that magnetohydrodynamic\nwaves are ubiquitous throughout. Improvements in instrumentation and the\ntechniques used for measurement of the waves now enables subtleties of\ncompeting theoretical models to be compared with the observed waves behaviour.\nSome studies have already begun to undertake this process. However, the\ntechniques employed for model comparison have generally been unsuitable and can\nlead to erroneous conclusions about the best model. The aim here is to\nintroduce some robust statistical techniques for model comparison to the solar\nwaves community, drawing on the experiences from other areas of astrophysics.\nIn the process, we also aim to investigate the physics of coronal loop\noscillations. } {The methodology exploits least-squares fitting to compare\nmodels to observational data. We demonstrate that the residuals between the\nmodel and observations contain significant information about the ability for\nthe model to describe the observations, and show how they can be assessed using\nvarious statistical tests. In particular we discuss the Kolmogorov-Smirnoff one\nand two sample tests, as well as the runs test. We also highlight the\nimportance of including any observational trend line in the model-fitting\nprocess.} {To demonstrate the methodology, an observation of an oscillating\ncoronal loop undergoing standing kink motion is used. The model comparison\ntechniques provide evidence that a Gaussian damping profile provides a better\ndescription of the observed wave attenuation than the often used exponential\nprofile. This supports previous analysis from Pascoe et al. (2016). Further, we\nuse the model comparison to provide evidence of time-dependent wave properties\nof a kink oscillation, attributing the behaviour to the thermodynamic evolution\nof the local plasma.}\n", "  Negative entropy in connection with the Casimir effect at uniform temperature\nis a phenomenon rooted in the circumstance that one is describing a nonclosed\nsystem, or only part of a closed system. In this paper we show that the\nphenomenon is not necessarily restricted to electromagnetic theory, but can be\nderived from the quantum theory of interacting harmonic oscillators, most\ntypically two oscillators interacting not directly but indirectly via a third\none. There are two such models, actually analogous to the transverse magnetic\n(TM) and transverse electric (TE) modes in electrodynamics. These mechanical\nmodels in their simplest version were presented some years ago, by J. S.\nH{\\o}ye et al., Physical Review E {\\bf 67}, 056116 (2003). In the present paper\nwe re-emphasize the physical significance of the mechanical picture, and extend\nthe theory so as to include the case where there are several mediating\noscillators, instead of only one. The TE oscillator exhibits negative entropy.\nFinally, we show explicitly how the interactions via the electromagnetic field\ncontain the two oscillator models.\n", "  The concept of pseudomagnitude was recently introduced by Chelli et al.\n(2016), to estimate apparent stellar diameters using a strictly observational\nmethodology. Pseudomagnitudes are distance indicators, which have the\nremarkable property of being reddening free. In this study, we use Hipparcos\nparallax measurements to compute the mean absolute pseudomagnitudes of solar\nneighbourhood dwarf stars as a function of their spectral type. To illustrate\nthe use of absolute pseudomagnitudes, we derive the distance moduli of $360$\nPleiades stars and find that the centroid of their distribution is\n$5.715\\pm0.018$, corresponding to a distance of $139.0\\pm1.2$\\,pc. We locate\nthe subset of $\\sim 50$ Pleiades stars observed by Hipparcos at a mean distance\nof $135.5\\pm3.7$\\,pc, thus confirming the frequently reported anomaly in the\nHipparcos measurements of these stars.\n", "  Self-assembly into target structures is an efficient material design\nstrategy. Combining analytical calculations and computational techniques of\nevolutionary and Monte Carlo types, we report about a remarkable structural\nvariability of Wigner bilayer ground states, when charges are confined between\nparallel charged plates. Changing the inter-layer separation, or the plate\ncharge asymmetry, a cascade of ordered patterns emerges. At variance with the\nsymmetric case phenomenology, the competition between commensurability features\nand charge neutralization leads to long range attraction, appearance of\nmacroscopic charges, exotic phases, and non conventional phase transitions with\ndistinct critical indices, offering the possibility of a subtle, but precise\nand convenient control over patterns.\n", "  We present the numerical analysis of effectively interacting Group Field\nTheory (GFT) models in the context of the GFT quantum gravity condensate\nanalogue of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation for real Bose-Einstein condensates\nincluding combinatorially local interaction terms. Thus we go beyond the\nusually considered construction for free models.\n  More precisely, considering such interactions in a weak regime, we find\nsolutions for which the expectation value of the number operator N is finite,\nas in the free case. When tuning the interaction to the strongly nonlinear\nregime, however, we obtain solutions for which N grows and eventually blows up,\nwhich is reminiscent of what one observes for real Bose-Einstein condensates,\nwhere a strong interaction regime can only be realized at high density. This\nbehaviour suggests the breakdown of the Bogoliubov ansatz for quantum gravity\ncondensates and the need for non-Fock representations to describe the system\nwhen the condensate constituents are strongly correlated.\n  Furthermore, we study the expectation values of certain geometric operators\nimported from Loop Quantum Gravity in the free and interacting cases. In\nparticular, computing solutions around the nontrivial minima of the interaction\npotentials, one finds, already in the weakly interacting case, a nonvanishing\ncondensate population for which the spectra are dominated by the lowest\nnontrivial configuration of the quantum geometry. This result indicates that\nthe condensate may indeed consist of many smallest building blocks giving rise\nto an effectively continuous geometry, thus suggesting the interpretation of\nthe condensate phase to correspond to a geometric phase.\n", "  The present work is a sequel of our previous work Phys.Rev.D { 93}, 084018\n(2016) [arXiv:1601.08175 [gr-qc]] cite{hap} which depicted a simple version of\nan inflationary quintessential model whose inflationary stage was described by\na Higgs type potential and the quintessential phase was responsible due to an\nexponential potential. Additionally, the model predicted a nonsingular universe\nin past which was geodesically past incomplete. Further, it was also found that\nthe model is in agreement with the Planck 2013 data when running is allowed.\nBut, this model was found to be unsuccessful with Planck 2015 data with or\nwithout running. However, in this sequel we propose a family of models runs by\na single parameter $alpha in [0, 1]$ which proposes another \"inflationary\nquintessential model\" where the inflation and the quintessence regimes are\nrespectively described by a power law potential and a cosmological constant.\nThe model is also nonsingular although geodesically past incomplete as in the\ncited model. However, the present one is found to be more simple in compared to\nthe previous model and it is in excellent agreement with the observational\ndata. We note that unlike the previous model which matched only with Planck\n2013 data in presence of running, a large number of the models of this family\nwith $alpha in [0,1/2)$ matches with both Planck 2013 and Planck 2015 data\nwhether the running is allowed or not. Thus, the properties in the current\nfamily of models in compared to its past companion justify its need for a\nbetter cosmological model with the successive improvement of the observational\ndata.1\n", "  Controlling waves in complex media has become a major topic of interest,\nnotably through the concepts of time reversal and wavefront shaping. Recently,\nit was shown that spatial light modulators can counter-intuitively focus waves\nboth in space and time through multiple scattering media when illuminated with\noptical pulses. In this letter we transpose the concept to a microwave cavity\nusing flat arrays of electronically tunable resonators. We prove that\nmaximizing the Green's function between two antennas at a chosen time yields\ndiffraction limited spatio-temporal focusing. Then, changing the photons' dwell\ntime inside the cavity, we modify the relative distribution of the spatial and\ntemporal degrees of freedom (DoF), and we demonstrate that it has no impact on\nthe field enhancement: wavefront shaping makes use of all available DoF,\nirrespective of their spatial or temporal nature. Our results prove that\nwavefront shaping using simple electronically reconfigurable arrays of\nreflectors is a viable approach to the spatio-temporal control of microwaves,\nwith potential applications in medical imaging, therapy, telecommunications,\nradar or sensing. They also offer new fundamental insights regarding the\ncoupling of spatial and temporal DoF in complex media.\n", "  We present exact results for the steady-state density matrix of a general\nclass of driven-dissipative systems consisting of a nonlinear Kerr resonator in\nthe presence of both coherent (one-photon) and parametric (two-photon) driving\nand dissipation. Thanks to the analytical solution, obtained via the complex\nP-representation formalism, we are able to explore any regime, including photon\nblockade, multiphoton resonant effects, and a mesoscopic regime with large\nphoton density and quantum correlations. We show how the interplay between one-\nand two-photon driving provides a way to control the multimodality of the\nWigner function in regimes where the semiclassical theory exhibits\nmultistability. We also study the emergence of dissipative phase transitions in\nthe thermodynamic limit of large photon numbers.\n", "  By using a C3v symmetric (111) surface as a growth substrate, we are able to\nachieve high structural symmetry in self-assembled quantum dots, which are\nsuitable for use as quantum-entangled photon emitters. Here we report on the\nwavelength controllability of InAs dots on InP(111)A, which we realized by\ntuning the ternary alloy composition of In(Al,Ga)As barriers that were\nlattice-matched to InP. We changed the peak emission wavelength systematically\nfrom 1.3 to 1.7 micrometer by barrier band gap tuning. The observed spectral\nshift agreed with the result of numerical simulations that assumed a measured\nshape distribution independent of barrier choice.\n", "  The Peccei-Quinn mechanism presents a neat solution to the strong CP problem.\nAs a by-product, it provides an ideal dark matter candidate, \"the axion\",\nalbeit with a tiny mass. Axions therefore can act as dark radiation if excited\nwith large momenta after the end of inflation. Nevertheless, the recent\nmeasurement of relativistic degrees of freedom from cosmic microwave background\nradiation strictly constrains the abundance of such extra relativistic species.\nWe show that ultra-relativistic axions can be abundantly produced if the\nPeccei-Quinn field was initially displaced from the minimum of the potential.\nThis in lieu places an interesting constraint on the axion dark matter window\nwith large decay constant which is expected to be probed by future experiments.\nMoreover, an upper bound on the reheating temperature can be placed, which\nfurther constrains the thermal history of our Universe.\n", "  Based on the medium resolution near infrared spectra of 13CO (3,1) band,\ncarbon isotopic ratios are estimated in 48 M dwarfs, for which we had\ndetermined the carbon and oxygen abundances from CO and H2O lines,\nrespectively. We find clear evidence for the presence of a 13CO feature for the\nfirst time in the spectra of M dwarfs. The spectral resolution of our observed\ndata, however, is not high enough to analyze the 13CO feature directly.\nInstead, we compare observed spectrum with synthetic spectra assuming 12C/13C =\n10, 25, 50, 100, and 200 for each of 48 M dwarfs and estimate the best possible\n12C/13C ratio by the chi-square analysis. The resulting 12C/13C ratios in M\ndwarfs distribute from 39 to a lower limit of 200. The mean value of 31 M\ndwarfs for which 12C/13C ratios are determined is 12C/13C = 87 +- 21 (p.e.),\nand that of 48 M dwarfs including those with the lower limit of 200 is 12C/13C\n> 127 +- 41 (p.e.). These results are somewhat larger than the 12C/13C ratio of\nthe present interstellar matter (ISM) determined from the molecular lines\nobserved in the millimeter and optical wavelength regions. Since the amount of\n13C in the ISM has increased with time due to mass-loss from evolved stars, the\n12C/13C ratios in M dwarfs, reflecting those of the past ISM, should be larger\nthan those of the present ISM. In M dwarfs, log 13C/12C plotted against log Ac\nshows a large scatter without clear dependence on the metallicity. This result\nshows a marked contrast to log 16O/12C (= log Ao/Ac) plotted against log Ac,\nwhich shows a rather tight correlation with the larger value at the lower\nmetallicity. Such a contrast can be a natural consequence that 16O and 12C are\nthe primary products in the stellar nuclear synthesis while 13C is the\nsecondary product, at least partly.\n", "  In this paper, we scrutinize the effect of spectral index distribution on\nestimating the AGN (active galactic nucleus) radio luminosity function (RLF) by\na Monte Carlo method. We find that the traditional bivariate RLF estimators can\ncause bias in varying degree. The bias is especially pronounced for the\nflat-spectrum radio sources whose spectral index distribution is more\nscattered. We believe that the bias is caused because the $K$-corrections\ncomplicate the truncation boundary on the $L-z$ plane of the sample, but the\ntraditional bivariate RLF estimators have difficulty in dealing with this\nboundary condition properly. We suggest that the spectral index distribution\nshould be incorporated into the RLF analysis process to obtain a robust\nestimation. This drives the need for a trivariate function of the form\n$\\Phi(\\alpha,z,L)$ which we show provides an accurate basis for measuring the\nRLF.\n", "  We investigate the Milky Way Galaxy's radial and vertical metallicity\ngradients using a sample of 47,406 red clump stars from the RAVE DR4. This\nsample is more than twice the size of the largest sample in the literature\ninvestigating radial and vertical metallicity gradients. The absolute magnitude\nof Groenewegen (2008) is used to determine distances to our sample stars. The\nresulting distances agree with the RAVE DR4 distances Binney et al. (2014) of\nthe same stars. Our photometric method also provides distances to 6185 stars\nthat are not assigned a distance in RAVE DR4. The metallicity gradients are\ncalculated with their current orbital positions ($R_{gc}$ and $Z$) and with\ntheir orbital properties (mean Galactocentric distance, $R_{m}$ and $z_{max}$),\nas a function of the distance to the Galactic plane:\nd[Fe/H]/d$R_{gc}=$-$0.047\\pm0.003$ dex/kpc for $0\\leq |Z|\\leq0.5$ kpc and\nd[Fe/H]/d$R_m=$-$0.025\\pm0.002$ dex/kpc for $0\\leq z_{max}\\leq0.5$ kpc. This\nreaffirms the radial metallicity gradient in the thin disc but highlights that\ngradients are sensitive to the selection effects caused by the difference\nbetween $R_{gc}$ and $R_{m}$. The radial gradient is flat in the distance\ninterval 0.5-1 kpc from the plane and then becomes positive greater than 1 kpc\nfrom the plane. The radial metallicity gradients are also eccentricity\ndependent. We showed that d[Fe/H]/d$R_m=$-$0.089\\pm0.010$, -$0.073\\pm0.007$,\n-$0.053\\pm0.004$ and -$0.044\\pm0.002$ dex/kpc for $e_p\\leq0.05$, $e_p\\leq0.07$,\n$e_p\\leq0.10$ and $e_p\\leq0.20$ sub-samples, respectively, in the distance\ninterval $0\\leq z_{max}\\leq0.5$ kpc. Similar trend is found for vertical\nmetallicity gradients. Both the radial and vertical metallicity gradients are\nfound to become shallower as the eccentricity of the sample increases. These\nfindings can be used to constrain different formation scenarios of the thick\nand thin discs.\n", "  Recently, two gravitational wave (GW) signals, named as GW150914 and\nGW151226, have been detected by the two LIGO detectors. Although both signals\nwere identified as originating from merging black hole (BH) binaries, GWs from\nsystems containing neutron stars (NSs) are also expected to be detected in the\nnear future by the Advanced detector network. In this work, we assess the\naccuracy in measuring the NS mass ($M_{ns}$) for the GWs from BH-NS binaries\nadopting the Advanced LIGO sensitivity with a signal-to-noise ratio of 10. By\nusing the Fisher matrix method, we calculate the measurement errors ($\\sigma$)\nin $M_{ns}$ assuming the NS mass of $1 \\leq M_{ns}/M_{\\odot} \\leq 2$ and low\nmass BHs with the range of $4 \\leq M_{bh}/M_{\\odot} \\leq 10$. We used the\nTaylorF2 waveform model where the spins are aligned with the orbital angular\nmomentum, but here we only consider the BH spins. We find that the fractional\nerrors ($\\sigma/M_{ns} \\times 100$) are in the range of $10\\% - 50\\%$ in our\nmass region for a given dimensionless BH spin as $\\chi_{bh} = 0$. The errors\ntend to increase as the BH spin increases, and this tendency is stronger for\nhigher NS masses (or higher total masses). In particular, for the highest mass\nNSs ($M_{ns}=2~M_{\\odot}$), the errors $\\sigma$ can be larger than the true\nvalue of $M_{ns}$ if the dimensionless BH spin exceeds $\\sim 0.6$.\n", "  We consider the observability model in networks with arbitrary topologies. We\nintroduce a system of coupled nonlinear equations, valid under the locally\ntree-like ansatz, to describe the size of the largest observable cluster as a\nfunction of the fraction of directly observable nodes present in the network.\nWe perform a systematic analysis on 95 real-world graphs and compare our\ntheoretical predictions with numerical simulations of the observability model.\nOur method provides almost perfect predictions in the majority of the cases,\neven for networks with very large values of the clustering coefficient.\nPotential applications of our theory include the development of efficient and\nscalable algorithms for real-time surveillance of social networks, and\nmonitoring of technological networks.\n", "  We report $Suzaku$ X-ray observations of the dark subhalo associated with the\nmerging group of NGC 4839 in the Coma cluster. The X-ray image exhibits an\nelongated tail toward the southwest. The X-ray peak shifts approximately $1'$\naway from the weak-lensing mass center toward the opposite direction of the\nComa cluster center. We investigated the temperature, normalization, pressure,\nand entropy distributions around the subhalo. Excluding the X-ray tail, the\ntemperature beyond the truncation radius is 8-10$~\\rm keV$, which is two times\nhigher than that of the subhalo and the X-ray tail. The pressure is nearly\nuniform excluding southern part of the subhalo at two times of the truncation\nradius. We computed the gas mass within the truncation radius and the X-ray\ntail. While the gas fraction within the truncation radius is about 5 times\nsmaller than that of regular groups, the gas mass in the subhalo and the X-ray\ntail to weak-lensing mass ratio is consistent with that of regular groups.\nAssuming the infall velocity, $2000~\\rm km~s^{-1}$, the ram pressure is 1.4\ntimes greater than gravitational force per unit area. Assuming the\nKelvin-Helmholtz instabilities, the total lost mass is approximately\n$3\\times10^{11}~M_{\\odot}$. If this gas had originally been within the\ntruncation radius, the gas mass fraction of the subhalo would have been\ncomparable with those of regular groups before infalling to the Coma cluster.\n", "  Luminous Blue Variables (LBVs) are massive stars caught in a post-main\nsequence phase, during which they are losing a significant amount of mass. As,\non one hand, it is thought that the majority of massive stars are close\nbinaries that will interact during their lifetime, and on the other, the most\ndramatic example of an LBV, Eta Car, is a binary, it would be useful to find\nother binary LBVs. We present here interferometric observations of the LBV HR\nCar done with the AMBER and PIONIER instruments attached to ESO's Very Large\nTelescope Interferometer (VLTI). Our observations, spanning two years, clearly\nreveal that HR Car is a binary star. It is not yet possible to constrain fully\nthe orbit, and the orbital period may lie between a few years and several\nhundred years. We derive a radius for the primary in the system and possibly\nresolve as well the companion. The luminosity ratio in the H-band between the\ntwo components is changing with time, going from about 6 to 9. We also\ntentatively detect the presence of some background flux which remained at the\n2% level until January 2016, but then increased to 6% in April 2016. Our AMBER\nresults show that the emission line forming region of Br gamma is more extended\nthan the continuum emitting region as seen by PIONIER and may indicate some\nwind-wind interaction. Most importantly, we constrain the total masses of both\ncomponents, with the most likely range being 33.6 and 45 solar masses. Our\nresults show that the LBV HR Car is possibly an Eta Car analog binary system\nwith smaller masses, with variable components, and further monitoring of this\nobject is definitively called for.\n", "  Composite states of electrically charged and QCD-colored hyperquarks (HQs) in\na confining SU(N_HC) hypercolor gauge sector are a plausible extension of the\nstandard model at the TeV scale, and have been widely considered as an\nexplanation for the tentative LHC diphoton excess. Additional new physics is\nrequired to avoid a stable charged hyperbaryon in such theories. We classify\nrenormalizable models allowing the decay of this unwanted relic directly into\nstandard model states, showing that they are significantly restricted if the\nnew scalar states needed for UV completion are at the TeV scale. Alternatively,\nif hyperbaryon number is conserved, the charged relic can decay into a neutral\nhyperbaryon. Such theories are strongly constrained by direct detection, if the\nneutral constituent hyperquark carries color or weak isospin, and by LHC\nsearches for leptoquarks if it is a color singlet. We show that the neutral\nhyperbaryon can have the observed relic abundance if the confinement scale and\nthe hyperquark mass are above TeV scale, even in the absence of any hyperbaryon\nasymmetry.\n", "  We have developed a new method of data processing for radio telescope\nobservation data to measure time-dependent temporal coherence, and we named it\ncross-correlation spectrometry (XCS). XCS is an autocorrelation procedure that\nexpands time lags over the integration time and is applied to data obtained\nfrom a single-dish observation. The temporal coherence property of received\nsignals is enhanced by XCS. We tested the XCS technique using the data of\nstrong H2O masers in W3 (H2O), W49N and W75N. We obtained the temporal coherent\nlengths of the maser emission to be 17.95 $\\pm$ 0.33 {\\mu}s, 26.89 $\\pm$ 0.49\n{\\mu}s and 15.95 $\\pm$ 0.46 {\\mu}s for W3 (H2O), W49N and W75N, respectively.\nThese results may indicate the existence of a coherent astrophysical maser.\n", "  We present simultaneous mappings of J=1-0 emission of 12CO, 13CO, and C18O\nmolecules toward the whole disk (8' x 5' or 20.8 kpc x 13.0 kpc) of the nearby\nbarred spiral galaxy NGC 2903 with the Nobeyama Radio Observatory 45-m\ntelescope at an effective angular resolution of 20\" (or 870 pc). We detected\n12CO(J=1-0) emission over the disk of NGC 2903. In addition, significant\n13CO(J=1-0) emission was found at the center and bar-ends, whereas we could not\ndetect any significant C18O(J=1-0) emission. In order to improve the\nsignal-to-noise ratio of CO emission and to obtain accurate line ratios of\n12CO(J=2-1)/12CO(J=1-0) ($R_{2-1/1-0}$) and 13CO(J=1-0)/12CO(J=1-0)\n($R_{13/12}$), we performed the stacking analysis for our 12CO(J=1-0),\n13CO(J=1-0), and archival 12CO(J=2-1) spectra with velocity-axis alignment in\nnine representative regions of NGC 2903. We successfully obtained the stacked\nspectra of the three CO lines, and could measure averaged $R_{2-1/1-0}$ and\n$R_{13/12}$ with high significance for all the regions. We found that both\n$R_{2-1/1-0}$ and $R_{13/12}$ differ according to the regions, which reflects\nthe difference in the physical properties of molecular gas; i.e., density\n($n_{\\rm H_2}$) and kinetic temperature ($T_K$). We determined $n_{\\rm H_2}$\nand $T_K$ using $R_{2-1/1-0}$ and $R_{13/12}$ based on the large velocity\ngradient approximation. The derived $n_{\\rm H_2}$ ranges from ~ 1000 cm$^{-3}$\n(in the bar, bar-ends, and spiral arms) to 3700 cm$^{-3}$ (at the center) and\nthe derived $T_K$ ranges from 10 K (in the bar and spiral arms) to 30 K (at the\ncenter). We examined the dependence of star formation efficiencies (SFEs) on\n$n_{\\rm H_2}$ and $T_K$, and found the positive correlation between SFE and\n$n_{\\rm H_2}$ with the correlation coefficient for the least-square power-law\nfit $R^2$ of 0.50. This suggests that molecular gas density governs the spatial\nvariations in SFEs.\n", "  The precession of a test gyroscope along stable bound equatorial plane orbits\naround a Kerr black hole is analyzed and the precession angular velocity of the\ngyro's parallel transported spin vector and the increment in precession angle\nafter one orbital period is evaluated. The parallel transported Marck frame\nwhich enters this discussion is shown to have an elegant geometrical\nexplanation in terms of the electric and magnetic parts of the Killing-Yano\n2-form and a Wigner rotation effect.\n", "  The perturbative effective potential suffers infrared (IR) divergences in\ngauges with massless Goldstones in their minima (like Landau or Fermi gauges)\nbut the problem can be fixed by a suitable resummation of the Goldstone\npropagators. When the potential minimum is generated radiatively,\ngauge-independence of the potential at the minimum also requires resummation\nand we demonstrate that the resummation that solves the IR problem also cures\nthe gauge-dependence issue, showing this explicitly in the Abelian Higgs model\nin Fermi gauge. In the process we find an IR divergence (in the location of the\nminimum) specific to Fermi gauge and not appreciated in recent literature. We\nshow that physical observables can still be computed in this gauge and we\nfurther show how to get rid of this divergence by a field redefinition. All\nthese results generalize to the Standard Model case.\n", "  The strong coupling between electronic transport in a single-level quantum\ndot and a capacitively coupled nano-mechanical oscillator may lead to a\ntransition towards a mechanically-bistable and blocked-current state. Its\nobservation is at reach in carbon-nanotube state-of-art experiments. In a\nrecent publication [Phys. Rev. Lett. 115, 206802 (2015)] we have shown that\nthis transition is characterized by pronounced signatures on the oscillator\nmechanical properties: the susceptibility, the displacement fluctuation\nspectrum and the ring-down time. These properties are extracted from transport\nmeasurements, however the relation between the mechanical quantities and the\nelectronic signal is not always straightforward. Moreover the dependence of the\nsame quantities on temperature, bias or gate voltage, and external dissipation\nhas not been studied. The purpose of this paper is to fill this gap and provide\na detailed description of the transition. Specifically we find: (i) The\nrelation between the current-noise and the displacement spectrum. (ii) The\npeculiar behavior of the gate-voltage dependence of these spectra at the\ntransition. (iii) The robustness of the transition towards the effect of\nexternal fluctuations and dissipation.\n", "  We present the first image of the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (SZE)\nobtained by the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). Combining\n7-m and 12-m arrays in Band 3, we create an SZE map toward a galaxy cluster\nRXJ1347.5-1145 with 5 arc-second resolution (corresponding to the physical size\nof 20 kpc/h), the highest angular and physical spatial resolutions achieved to\ndate for imaging the SZE, while retaining extended signals out to 40\narc-seconds. The 1-sigma statistical sensitivity of the image is 0.017 mJy/beam\nor 0.12 mK_CMB at the 5 arc-second full width at half maximum. The SZE image\nshows a good agreement with an electron pressure map reconstructed\nindependently from the X-ray data and offers a new probe of the small-scale\nstructure of the intracluster medium. Our results demonstrate that ALMA is a\npowerful instrument for imaging the SZE in compact galaxy clusters with\nunprecedented angular resolution and sensitivity. As the first report on the\ndetection of the SZE by ALMA, we present detailed analysis procedures including\ncorrections for the missing flux, to provide guiding methods for analyzing and\ninterpreting future SZE images by ALMA.\n", "  The ruby lattice is a four-valent lattice interpolating between honeycomb and\ntriangular lattices. In this work we investigate the topological spin-liquid\nphases of a spin Hamiltonian with Kitaev interactions on the ruby lattice using\nexact diagonalization and perturbative methods. The latter interactions\ncombined with the structure of the lattice yield a model with $\\mathbb{Z}_2\n\\times \\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge symmetry. We mapped out the phase digram of the\nmodel and found gapped and gapless spin-liquid phases. While the low energy\nsector of the gapped phase corresponds to the well-known topological color code\nmodel on a honeycomb lattice, the low-energy sector of the gapless phases is\ndescribed by an effective spin model with three-body interactions on a\ntriangular lattice. A gap is opened in the spectrum in a small magnetic field.\nWe argue that the latter phases could be possibly described by exotic\nexcitations, whose their spectrum is richer than the Ising phase of the Kitaev\nmodel.\n", "  To complement recent work on tests of spacetime symmetry in gravity, cubic\ncurvature couplings are studied using an effective field theory description of\nspacetime-symmetry breaking. The associated mass dimension 8 coefficients for\nLorentz violation studied do not result in any linearized gravity modifications\nand instead are revealed in the first nonlinear terms in an expansion of\nspacetime around a flat background. We consider effects on gravitational\nradiation through the energy loss of a binary system and we study two-body\norbital perturbations using the post-Newtonian metric. Some effects depend on\nthe internal structure of the source and test bodies, thereby breaking the Weak\nEquivalence Principle for self-gravitating bodies. These coefficients can be\nmeasured in solar-system tests, while binary-pulsar systems and short-range\ngravity tests are particularly sensitive.\n", "  We present a method to identify spurious signals generated by finite-width\npulses in quantum sensing experiments and apply it to recently proposed\ndynamical decoupling sequences for accurate spectral interpretation. We first\nstudy the origin of these fake resonances and quantify their behavior in a\nsituation that involves the measurement of a classical magnetic field. Here we\nshow that a change of the initial phase of the sensor or, equivalently, of the\ndecoupling pulses leads to oscillations in the spurious signal intensity while\nthe real resonances remain intact. Finally we extend our results to the quantum\nregime for the unambiguous detection of remote nuclear spins by utilization of\na nitrogen vacancy sensor in diamond.\n", "  In creating a large-scale quantum information processor, the ability to\nconstruct control pulses for implementing an arbitrary quantum circuit in a\nscalable manner is an important requirement. For liquid-state nuclear magnetic\nresonance (NMR) quantum computing, a circuit is generally realized through a\nsequence of selective soft pulses, in which various control imperfections exist\nand are to be corrected. In this work, we present a comprehensive analysis of\nthe errors arisen in a selective pulse network by using the zeroth and first\norder average Hamiltonian theory. Effective correction rules are derived for\nadjusting important pulse parameters such as irradiation frequencies,\nrotational angles and transmission phases of the selective pulses to increase\nthe control fidelity. Simulations show that applying our compilation procedure\nfor a given circuit is efficient and can greatly reduce the error accumulation.\n", "  The magnetic and electronic properties of the magnetically doped topological\ninsulator Bi$_{\\rm 2-x}$Mn$_{\\rm x}$Te$_3$ were studied using electron spin\nresonance (ESR) and measurements of static magnetization and electrical\ntransport. The investigated high quality single crystals of Bi$_{\\rm\n2-x}$Mn$_{\\rm x}$Te$_3$ show a ferromagnetic phase transition for $x\\geq 0.04$\nat $T_{C}\\approx 12$ K. The Hall measurements reveal a p-type finite\ncharge-carrier density. Measurements of the temperature dependence of the ESR\nsignal of Mn dopants for different orientations of the external magnetic field\ngive evidence that the localized Mn moments interact with the mobile charge\ncarriers leading to a Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida-type ferromagnetic coupling\nbetween the Mn spins of order 2-3 meV. Furthermore, ESR reveals a\nlow-dimensional character of magnetic correlations that persist far above the\nferromagnetic ordering temperature.\n", "  We present a theoretical analysis that associates the resonances of\nextraordinary acoustic Raman (EAR) spectroscopy [Wheaton et al., Nat Photon 9,\n68 (2015)] with the collective modes of proteins. The theory uses the\nanisotropic elastic network model to find the protein acoustic modes, and\ncalculates Raman intensity by treating the protein as a polarizable ellipsoid.\nReasonable agreement is found between EAR spectra and our theory. Protein\nacoustic modes have been extensively studied theoretically to assess the role\nthey play in protein function; this result suggests EAR as a new experimental\ntool for studies of protein acoustic modes.\n", "  Galactic Gamma ray astronomy at very high energy (E > 30 TeV) is a vital tool\nin the study of the non-thermal universe. The interpretation of the\nobservations in this energy region requires the precise modeling of the\nattenuation of photons due to pair production interactions, where the targets\nare the radiation fields present in interstellar space. For gamma rays with\nenergy E > 300 TeV the attenuation is mostly due to the photons of the Cosmic\nMicrowave Background Radiation (CMBR). At lower energy the most important\ntarget are infrared photons with wavelengths in the range 50-500 micron emitted\nby dust. The evaluation of the attenuation requires a good knowledge of the\ndensity, and energy and angular distributions of the target photons for all\npositions in the Galaxy. In this work we discuss a simple model for the\ninfrared radiation that depends on only few parameters associated to the space\nand temperature distributions of the emitting dust. The model allows to compute\nwith good accuracy the effects of absorption for any space and energy\ndistribution of the diffuse Galactic gamma ray emission. The absorption\nprobability due to the Galactic infrared radiation is maximum for E around 150\nTeV, and can be as large as P_abs around 0.45 for distant sources on lines of\nsight that pass close to the Galactic Center. The systematic uncertainties on\nthe absorption probability are estimated as Delta P_abs < 0.08.\n", "  We study the recently discovered q-deformed Poincare' supersymmetry of the\nAdS_3/CFT_2 integrable massless scattering, and demonstrate how the S-matrix is\ninvariant under boosts. The boost generator has a non-local coproduct, which\nacts on the scattering matrix as a differential operator, annihilating it. We\npropose to reinterpret the boost action in terms of covariant derivatives on\nbundles, and derive an expression for the S-matrix as the path-ordered\nexponential of a flat connection. We provide a list of possible alternative\ninterpretations of this emergent geometric picture, including a one-dimensional\nauxiliary Schroedinger problem. We support our claims by performing a\nsimplified algebraic Bethe ansatz, which bears some resemblance to\nantiferromagnets.\n", "  We find a new substellar companion to the Pleiades member star, Pleiades HII\n3441, using the Subaru telescope with adaptive optics. The discovery is made as\npart of the high-contrast imaging survey to search for planetary-mass and\nsubstellar companions in the Pleiades and young moving groups. The companion\nhas a projected separation of 0\".49 +/- 0\".02 (66 +/- 2 AU) and a mass of 68\n+/- 5 M_J based on three observations in the J-, H-, and K_S-band. The spectral\ntype is estimated to be M7 (~2700 K), and thus no methane absorption is\ndetected in the H band. Our Pleiades observations result in the detection of\ntwo substellar companions including one previously reported among 20 observed\nPleiades stars, and indicate that the fraction of substellar companions in the\nPleiades is about 10.0 +26.1/-8.8 %. This is consistent with multiplicity\nstudies of both the Pleiades stars and other open clusters.\n", "  HLX-1, currently the best intermediate-mass black hole candidate, has\nundergone seven violent outbursts, each with a peak X-ray luminosity of\n$L_{\\mathrm{peak},\\mathrm{X}}\\sim 10^{42}\\ \\rm{erg\\ s^{-1}}$. Interestingly,\nthe properties of the HLX-1 outbursts evolve with time. In this work, we aim to\nconstrain the physical parameters of the central engine of the HLX-1 outbursts\nin the framework of the black hole accretion. We find that the physical\nproperties of the HLX-1 outbursts are consistent with being driven by the\nradiation pressure instability. This scenario can explain the evolution of the\nrecurrent timescales of the HLX-1 outbursts as a function of the durations.\n", "  Updated imaging and photometric results from Chandra observations of SN\n1987A, covering the last 16 years, are presented. We find that the 0.5-2 keV\nlight curve has remained constant at ~8x10^-12 erg s^-1 cm^-2 since 9500 days,\nwith the 3-8 keV light curve continuing to increase until at least 10000 days.\nThe expansion rate of the ring is found to be energy dependent, such that after\nday 6000 the ring expands faster in the 2-10 keV band than it does at energies\n<2 keV. Images show a reversal of the east-west asymmetry between 7000 and 8000\ndays after the explosion. The latest images suggest the southeastern side of\nthe equatorial ring is beginning to fade. Consistent with the latest optical\nand infrared results, our Chandra analysis indicates the blast wave is now\nleaving the dense equatorial ring, which marks the beginning of a major change\nin the evolutionary phase of the supernova remnant 1987A.\n", "  In this paper general dynamic equations describing the time evolution of\nisothermal quasi-incompressible multicomponent liquids are derived in the\nframework of the classical Ginzburg-Landau theory of first order phase\ntransformations. Based on the fundamental {equations of continuum mechanics}, a\ngeneral convection-diffusion dynamics is set up first for compressible liquids.\nThe constitutive relations for the diffusion fluxes and the capillary stress\nare determined in the framework of gradient theories. {Next the general\ndefinition of incompressibility is given}, which is taken into account {in the\nderivation} by using the Lagrange multiplier method. To validate the theory,\nthe dynamic equations are solved numerically for the quaternary\nquasi-incompressible Cahn-Hilliard system. It is demonstrated that variable\ndensity (i) has no effect on equilibrium (in case of a suitably constructed\nfree energy functional), {and (ii) can} influence non-equilibrium pattern\nformation significantly.\n", "  The high Antarctic plateau provides exceptional conditions for conducting\ninfrared observations of the cosmos on account of the cold, dry and stable\natmosphere above the ice surface. This paper describes the scientific goals\nbehind the first program to examine the time-varying universe in the infrared\nfrom Antarctica - the Kunlun Infrared Sky Survey (KISS). This will employ a\nsmall (50 cm aperture) telescope to monitor the southern skies in the 2.4um\nKdark window from China's Kunlun station at Dome A, on the summit of the\nAntarctic plateau, through the uninterrupted 4-month period of winter darkness.\nAn earlier paper discussed optimisation of the Kdark filter for the best\nsensitivity (Li et al 2016). This paper examines the scientific program for\nKISS. We calculate the sensitivity of the camera for the extrema of observing\nconditions that will be encountered. We present the parameters for sample\nsurveys that could then be carried out for a range of cadences and\nsensitivities. We then discuss several science programs that could be conducted\nwith these capabilities, involving star formation, brown dwarfs and hot\nJupiters, exoplanets around M dwarfs, the terminal phases of stellar evolution,\ndiscovering fast transients as part of multi-wavelength campaigns, embedded\nsupernova searches, reverberation mapping of active galactic nuclei, gamma ray\nbursts and the detection of the cosmic infrared background.\n  Accepted for publication in PASA, 04/08/16.\n", "  The impulsive noise in astronomical images originates from various sources.\nIt develops as a result of thermal generation in pixels, collision of cosmic\nrays with image sensor or may be induced by high readout voltage in Electron\nMultiplying CCD (EMCCD). It is usually efficiently removed by employing the\ndark frames or by averaging several exposures. Unfortunately, there are some\ncircumstances, when either the observed objects or positions of impulsive\npixels evolve and therefore each obtained image has to be filtered\nindependently. In this article we present an overview of impulsive noise\nfiltering methods and compare their efficiency for the purpose of astronomical\nimage enhancement. The employed set of noise templates consists of dark frames\nobtained from CCD and EMCCD cameras working on ground and in space. The\nexperiments conducted on synthetic and real images, allowed for drawing\nnumerous conclusions about the usefulness of several filtering methods for\nvarious: (1) widths of stellar profiles, (2) signal to noise ratios, (3) noise\ndistributions and (4) applied imaging techniques. The results of presented\nevaluation are especially valuable for selection of the most efficient\nfiltering schema in astronomical image processing pipelines.\n", "  L-band spectroscopy is a powerful probe of cool low-gravity atmospheres: The\nP, Q, and R branch fundamental transitions of methane near 3.3 $\\mu$m provide a\nsensitive probe of carbon chemistry; cloud thickness modifies the spectral\nslope across the band; and H$_{3}^{+}$ opacity can be used to detect aurorae.\nMany directly imaged gas-giant companions to nearby young stars exhibit L-band\nfluxes distinct from the field population of brown dwarfs at the same effective\ntemperature. Here we describe commissioning the L-band spectroscopic mode of\nClio2, the 1-5 $\\mu$m instrument behind the Magellan adaptive-optics system. We\nuse this system to measure L-band spectra of directly imaged companions. Our\nspectra are generally consistent with the parameters derived from previous\nnear-infrared spectra for these late M to early L type objects. Therefore,\ndeviations from the field sequence are constrained to occur below 1500 K. This\nrange includes the L-T transition for field objects and suggests that observed\ndiscrepancies are due to differences in cloud structure and CO/CH$_{4}$\nchemistry.\n", "  We propose a radiative seesaw model at the three-loop level, in which quarks,\nleptons, leptoquark bosons, and a Majorana fermion of dark matter candidate are\ninvolved in the neutrino loop. Analyzing neutrino oscillation data including\nall possible constraints such as flavor changing neutral currents, lepton\nflavor violations, upper/lower bound on the mass of leptoquark from the\ncollider physics, and the measured relic density of the dark matter, we show\nthe allowed region to satisfy all the data/constraints.\n", "  Random heteropolymers are a minimal description of biopolymers and can\nprovide a theoretical framework to the investigate the formation of loops in\nbiophysical experiments. A two--state model provides a consistent and robust\nway to study the scaling properties of loop formation in polymers of the size\nof typical biological systems. Combining it with self--adjusting\nsimulated--tempering simulations, we can calculate numerically the looping\nproperties of several realizations of the random interactions within the chain.\nDifferently from homopolymers, random heteropolymers display at different\ntemperatures a continuous set of scaling exponents. The necessity of using\nself--averaging quantities makes finite--size effects dominant at low\ntemperatures even for long polymers, shadowing the length--independent\ncharacter of looping probability expected in analogy with homopolymeric\nglobules. This could provide a simple explanation for the small scaling\nexponents found in experiments, for example in chromosome folding.\n", "  The diversity of characteristics for the host of recently discovered\nexoplanets opens up a great deal of fertile new territory for geophysical fluid\ndynamics, particularly when the fluid flow is coupled to novel thermodynamics,\nradiative transfer or chemistry. In this paper, we survey one of these new\nareas-the climate dynamics of atmospheres with a non-dilute condensible\ncomponent, defined as the situation in which a condensible component of the\natmosphere makes up a substantial fraction of the atmospheric mass within some\nlayer. Non-dilute dynamics can occur for a wide range of condensibles,\ngenerically applying near both the inner and the outer edges of the\nconventional habitable zone and in connection with runaway greenhouse\nphenomena. It also applies in a wide variety of other planetary circumstances.\nWe first present a number of analytical results developing some key features of\nnon-dilute atmospheres, and then show how some of these features are manifest\nin simulations with a general circulation model adapted to handle non-dilute\natmospheres. We find that non-dilute atmospheres have weak horizontal\ntemperature gradients even for rapidly rotating planets, and that their\ncirculations are largely barotropic. The relative humidity of the condensible\ncomponent tends towards 100% as the atmosphere becomes more non-dilute, which\nhas important implications for runaway greenhouse thresholds. Non-dilute\natmospheres exhibit a number of interesting organized convection features, for\nwhich there is not yet any adequate theoretical understanding.\n", "  Using single-component fits to SDSS/UKIDSS images of galaxies in the G09\nregion of the GAMA survey we study radial colour gradients across the galaxy\npopulation. We use the multiwavelength information provided by MegaMorph\nanalysis of galaxy light profiles to calculate intrinsic colour gradients, and\ndivide into six subsamples split by overall S\\'{e}rsic index ($n$) and galaxy\ncolour. We find a bimodality in the colour gradients of high- and low-$n$\ngalaxies in all wavebands, which varies with overall galaxy luminosity. Global\ntrends in colour gradients therefore result from combining the contrasting\nbehaviour of a number of different galaxy populations. The ubiquity of strong\nnegative colour gradients supports the picture of inside-out growth through gas\naccretion for blue, low-$n$ galaxies, and through dry minor mergers for red,\nhigh-$n$ galaxies. An exception is the blue high-n population, with properties\nindicative of dissipative major mergers.\n", "  The significance of the magnitude of Prandtl number of a fluid in the\npropagation direction of induced convection rolls is elucidated. Specifically,\nwe report on the physical mechanism to account for the formation and\norientation of previously unexplored supra-wavelength periodic surface\nstructures in dielectrics, following melting and subsequent capillary effects\ninduced upon irradiation with ultrashort laser pulses. Counterintuitively, it\nis found that such structures exhibit periodicities, which are markedly, even\nmultiple times, higher than the laser excitation wavelength. It turns out that\nthe extent to which the hydrothermal waves relax depends upon the laser beam\nenergy, produced electron densities upon excitation with femtosecond pulsed\nlasers, magnitude of the induced initial local roll disturbances and the\nmagnitude of the Prandtl number with direct consequences on the orientation and\nsize of the induced structures. It is envisaged that this elucidation may be\nuseful for the interpretation of similar, albeit large-scale periodic or\nquasi-periodic structures formed in other natural systems due to thermal\ngradients, while it can also be of great importance for potential applications\nin biomimetics.\n", "  Fragmentation functions are determined for the pion and kaon by global\nanalyses of charged-hadron production data in electron-positron annihilation.\nAccurate measurements were reported by the Belle and BaBar collaborations for\nthe fragmentation functions at the center-of-mass energies of 10.52 GeV and\n10.54 GeV, respectively, at the KEK and SLAC B factories, whereas other\navailable $e^+e^-$ measurements were mostly done at higher energies, mainly at\nthe $Z$ mass of 91.2 GeV. There is a possibility that gluon fragmentation\nfunctions, as well as quark fragmentation functions, are accurately determined\nby scaling violation. We report our global analysis of the fragmentation\nfunctions especially to show impacts of the B-factory measurements on the\nfragmentation function determination. Our results indicate that the\nfragmentation functions are determined more accurately not only by the scaling\nviolation but also by high-statistical nature of the Belle and BaBar data.\nHowever, there are some tensions between the Belle and BaBar data in comparison\nwith previous measurements. We also explain how the flavor dependence of quark\nfragmentation functions and the gluon function are separated by using\nmeasurements at different $Q^2$ values. In particular, the electric and weak\nchanges are different depending on the quark type, so that a light-quark flavor\nseparation also became possible in principle due to the precise data at both\n$\\sqrt{s}\\simeq 10.5$ GeV and 91.2 GeV.\n", "  We present a general framework to study the phase transition of a black hole.\nAssuming that there is a phase transition, it is shown that without invoking\nany specific black hole, the critical exponents and the scaling powers can be\nobtained. We find that the values are exactly same which were calculated by\ntaking explicit forms of different black hole spacetimes. The reason for this\nuniversality is also explained. The implication of the analysis is -- one does\nnot need to investigate this problem case by case, what the people are doing\nright now. We also observe that these, except two such quantities, are\nindependent of the details of the spacetime dimensions.\n", "  The properties expected of \"hot\" non-flaring plasmas due to nanoflare heating\nin active regions are investigated using hydrodynamic modeling tools, including\na two-fluid development of the EBTEL code. Here we study a single nanoflare and\nshow that while simple models predict an emission measure distribution\nextending well above 10 MK that is consistent with cooling by thermal\nconduction, many other effects are likely to limit the existence and\ndetectability of such plasmas. These include: differential heating between\nelectrons and ions, ionization non-equilibrium and, for short nanoflares, the\ntime taken for the coronal density to increase. The most useful temperature\nrange to look for this plasma, often called the \"smoking gun\" of nanoflare\nheating, lies between $10^{6.6}$ and $10^7$ K. Signatures of the actual heating\nmay be detectable in some instances.\n", "  We report nine long X-ray bursts from neutron stars, detected with Monitor of\nAll-sky X-ray Image (MAXI). Some of these bursts lasted for hours, and hence\nare qualified as superbursts, which are prolonged thermonuclear flashes on\nneutron stars and are relatively rare events. MAXI observes roughly 85% of the\nwhole sky every 92 minutes in the 2-20 keV energy band, and has detected nine\nbursts with a long e-folding decay time, ranging from 0.27 to 5.2 hours, since\nits launch in 2009 August until 2015 August. The majority of the nine events\nwere found to originate from transient X-ray sources. The persistent\nluminosities of the sources, when these prolonged bursts were observed, were\nlower than 1% of the Eddington luminosity for five of them and lower than 20%\nfor the rest. This trend is contrastive to the 18 superbursts observed before\nMAXI, all but two of which originated from bright persistent sources. The\ndistribution of the total emitted energy, i.e., the product of e-folding time\nand luminosity, of these bursts clusters around $10^{41}$-$10^{42}$ erg,\nwhereas either of the e-folding time and luminosity ranges for an order of\nmagnitude. Among the nine events, two were from 4U 1850-086 during the phases\nof relatively low persistent-flux, whereas it usually exhibits standard short\nX-ray bursts during outbursts.\n", "  Neutron stars are fascinating astrophysical objects immersed in strong\ngravitational and electromagnetic fields, at the edge of our current theories.\nThese stars manifest themselves mostly as pulsars, emitting a timely very\nstable and regular electromagnetic signal. Even though discovered almost fifty\nyears ago, they still remain mysterious compact stellar objects. In this\nreview, we summarize the most fundamental theoretical aspects of neutron star\nmagnetospheres and winds. The main competing models susceptible to explain\ntheir radiative properties like multi-wavelength pulse shapes and spectra and\nthe underlying physical processes such as pair creation and radiation\nmechanisms are scrutinized. A global but still rather qualitative picture\nemerges slowly thanks to recent advances in numerical simulations on the\nlargest scales. However considerations about pulsar magnetospheres remain\nspeculative. For instance the exact composition of the magnetospheric plasma is\nnot yet known. Is it solely filled with a mixture of $e^\\pm$~leptons, or does\nit contain a non negligible fraction of protons and/or ions? Actually, is it\nalmost entirely filled or mostly empty except for some small anecdotal plasma\nfilled regions? Answers to these questions will strongly direct the description\nof the magnetosphere to seemingly contradictory results leading sometimes to\ninconsistencies. Nevertheless, account are given to the latest developments in\nthe theory of pulsar magnetospheres and winds, the existence of a possible\nelectrosphere and physical insight obtained from related observational\nsignatures of multi-wavelength pulsed emission.\n", "  Between 1984 and 2011, the percentage of US bachelor degrees awarded in\nphysics declined by 25%, in chemistry declined by 33%, and overall in physical\nsciences and engineering fell 40%. Data suggest that these declines are\ncorrelated to a deemphasis in most states of practicing computation skills in\nmathematics. Analysis of state standards put into place between 1990 and 2010\nfind that most states directed teachers to deemphasize both memorization and\nstudent practice in computational problem solving. Available state test score\ndata show a significant decline in student computation skills. In recent\ninternational testing, scores for US 16 to 24 year olds in numeracy finished\nlast among 22 tested nations in the OECD. Recent studies in cognitive science\nhave found that to solve well-structured problems in the sciences, students\nmust first memorize fundamental facts and procedures in mathematics and science\nuntil they can be recalled with automaticity, then practice applying those\nskills in a variety of distinctive contexts. Actions are suggested to improve\nUS STEM graduation rates by aligning US math and science curricula with the\nrecommendations of cognitive science.\n", "  We present the new single dish CO (3-2) emission data obtained toward 19\nearly stage and 7 late stage nearby merging galaxies using the Atacama\nSubmillimeter Telescope Experiment (ASTE). Combining with the single dish and\ninterferometric data of galaxies observed in previous studies, we investigate\nthe relation between the CO (3-2) luminosity (L'CO(3-2)) and the far Infrared\nluminosity (LFIR) in a sample of 29 early stage and 31 late stage merging\ngalaxies, and 28 nearby isolated spiral galaxies. We find that normal isolated\nspiral galaxies and merging galaxies have different slopes (alpha) in the log\nL'CO(3-2) - log LFIR plane (alpha ~ 0.79 for spirals and ~ 1.12 for mergers).\nThe large slope (alpha > 1) for merging galaxies can be interpreted as an\nevidence for increasing Star Formation Efficiency (SFE=LFIR/L'CO(3-2)) as a\nfunction of LFIR. Comparing our results with sub-kpc scale local star formation\nand global star-burst activity in the high-z Universe, we find deviations from\nthe linear relationship in the log L'CO(3-2) - log LFIR plane for the late\nstage mergers and high-z star forming galaxies. Finally, we find that the\naverage SFE gradually increases from isolated galaxies, merging galaxies, and\nto high-z submillimeter galaxies / quasi-stellar objects (SMGs/QSOs). By\ncomparing our findings with the results from numerical simulations, we suggest;\n(1) inefficient star-bursts triggered by disk-wide dense clumps occur in the\nearly stage of interaction and (2) efficient star-bursts triggered by central\nconcentration of gas occur in the final stage. A systematic high spatial\nresolution survey of diffuse and dense gas tracers is a key to confirm this\nscenario.\n", "  It was pointed out by Shifman and Yung that the critical superstring on\n$X^{10}={\\mathbb R}^4\\times Y^6$, where $Y^6$ is the resolved conifold, appears\nas an effective theory for a U(2) Yang-Mills-Higgs system with four fundamental\nHiggs scalars defined on $\\Sigma_2\\times{\\mathbb R}^2$, where $\\Sigma_2$ is a\ntwo-dimensional Lorentzian manifold. Their Yang-Mills model supports semilocal\nvortices on ${\\mathbb R}^2\\subset\\Sigma_2\\times{\\mathbb R}^2$ with a moduli\nspace $X^{10}$. When the moduli of slowly moving thin vortices depend on the\ncoordinates of $\\Sigma_2$, the vortex strings can be identified with critical\nfundamental strings. We show that similar results can be obtained for the\nlow-energy limit of pure Yang-Mills theory on $\\Sigma_2\\times T^2_p$, where\n$T^2_p$ is a two-dimensional torus with a puncture $p$. The solitonic vortices\nof Shifman and Yung then get replaced by flat connections. Various\nten-dimensional superstring target spaces can be obtained as moduli spaces of\nflat connections on $T^2_p$, depending on the choice of the gauge group. The\nfull Green-Schwarz sigma model requires extending the gauge group to a\nsupergroup and augmenting the action with a topological term.\n", "  The standard quantum limit constrains the precision of an oscillator position\nmeasurement. It arises from a balance between the imprecision and the quantum\nback-action of the measurement. However, a measurement of only a single\nquadrature of the oscillator can evade the back-action and be made with\narbitrary precision. Here we demonstrate quantum back-action evading\nmeasurements of a collective quadrature of two mechanical oscillators, both\ncoupled to a common microwave cavity. The work allows for quantum state\ntomography of two mechanical oscillators, and provides a foundation for\nmacroscopic mechanical entanglement and force sensing beyond conventional\nquantum limits.\n", "  Thermally activated domain wall (DW) motion in magnetic insulators has been\nconsidered theoretically, with a particular focus on the role of\nDzyaloshinskii-Moriya Interaction (DMI) and thermomagnonic torques. The\nthermally assisted DW motion is a consequence of the magnonic spin current due\nto the applied thermal bias. In addition to the exchange magnonic spin current\nand the exchange adiabatic and the entropic spin transfer torques, we also\nconsider the DMI-induced magnonic spin current, thermomagnonic DMI field-like\ntorque and the DMI entropic torque. Analytical estimations are supported by\nnumerical calculations. We found that the DMI has a substantial influence on\nthe size and the geometry of DWs, and that the DWs become oriented parallel to\nthe long axis of the nanostrip. Increasing the temperature smoothes the DWs.\nMoreover, the thermallyinduced magnonic current generates a torque on the DWs,\nwhich is responsible for their motion. From our analysis it follows that for a\nlarge enough DMI the influence of DMI-induced field-like torque is much\nstronger than that of the DMI and the exchange entropic torques. By\nmanipulating the strength of the DMI constant, one can control the speed of the\nDW motion, and the direction of the DW motion can be switched, as well. We also\nfound that DMI not only contributes to the total magnonic current, but also it\nmodifies the exchange magnonic spin current, and this modification depends on\nthe orientation of the steady state magnetization. The observed phenomenon can\nbe utilized in spin caloritronics devices, for example in the DMI based thermal\ndiodes. By switching the magnetization direction, one can rectify the total\nmagnonic spin current.\n", "  We investigated the superconducting order parameter of the filled\nskutterudite LaPt4Ge12, with a transition temperature of Tc = 8.3 K. To this\nend, we performed temperature and magnetic-field dependent specific-heat and\nthermal-conductivity measurements. All data are compatible with a single\nsuperconducting s-wave gap. However, a multiband scenario cannot be ruled out.\nThe results are discussed in the context of previous studies on the\nsubstitution series Pr1-xLaxPt4Ge12. They suggest compatible order parameters\nfor the two end compounds LaPt4Ge12 and PrPt4Ge12. This is not consistent with\na single s-wave gap in LaPt4Ge12 considering previous reports of unconventional\nand/or multiband superconductivity in PrPt4Ge12.\n", "  In this paper, we extend our works of Papers I and II, which are assigned to\nsystematically survey \\CIVab\\ narrow absorption lines (NALs) with\n\\zabs$\\ll$\\zem\\ on quasar spectra of the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic\nSurvey (BOSS), to collect \\CIV\\ NALs with \\zabs$\\approx$\\zem\\ from blue to red\nwings of \\CIVwave\\ emission lines. Together with Papers I and II, we have\ncollected a total number of 41,479 \\CIV\\ NALs with $1.4544\\le$\\zabs$\\le4.9224$\nin surveyed spectral region redward of \\lya\\ until red wing of \\CIVwave\\\nemission line. We find that the stronger \\CIV\\ NALs tend to be the more\nsaturated absorptions, and associated systems (\\zabs$\\approx$\\zem) seem to have\nlarger absorption strengths when compared to intervening ones (\\zabs$\\ll$\\zem).\nThe redshift density evolution behavior of absorbers (the number of absorbers\nper redshift path) is similar to the history of the cosmic star formation. When\ncompared to the quasar-frame velocity ($\\beta$) distribution of \\MgII\\\nabsorbers, the $\\beta$ distribution of \\CIV\\ absorbers is broader at\n$\\beta\\approx0$, shows longer extended tail, and exhibits a larger dispersion\nfor environmental absorptions. In addition, for associated \\CIV\\ absorbers, we\nfind that low-luminosity quasars seem to exhibit smaller $\\beta$ and stronger\nabsorptions when compared to high-luminosity quasars.\n", "  X-ray fluorescent lines are unique features of the reflection spectrum of the\ncold torus when irradiated by the central AGN. Their intrinsic line widths can\nbe used to probe the line-emitting region. The line widths of the Fe \\Ka line\nmeasured from the first order Chandra High Energy Grating (HEG) spectra are\n$3-5$ times larger than those measured with the Si \\Ka line for Circinus, Mrk\n3, and NGC 1068. Because the observed Si \\Ka and Fe \\Ka lines are not\nnecessarily coming from the same physical region, it is uncertain whether the\nline widths of the Fe \\Ka line are over-estimated or not. We measured the\nintrinsic line widths of the Fe \\Ka line of several nearby bright AGN using the\nsecond and third order Chandra HEG spectra, whose spectral resolutions are\nbetter than the first order data. We found the measured widths are all smaller\nthan those from the first order data. The results clearly show that the widths\nof the Fe \\Ka line measured from the first order HEG data are over-estimated.\nIt indicates that the Fe \\Ka lines of the studied sources are originating from\nregions around the cold dusty torus.\n", "  We demonstrate that light is subject to anomalous (i.e., negative)\ndiffraction when propagating in the presence of hyperbolic dispersion. We show\nthat light propagation in hyperbolic media resembles the dynamics of a quantum\nparticle of negative mass moving in a two-dimensional potential. The negative\neffective mass implies time reversal if the medium is homogeneous. Such\nproperty paves the way to diffraction compensation, spatial analogue of\ndispersion compensating fibers in the temporal domain. At variance with\nmaterials exhibiting standard elliptic dispersion, in inhomogeneous hyperbolic\nmaterials light waves are pulled towards regions with a lower refractive index.\nIn the presence of a Kerr-like optical response, bright (dark) solitons are\nsupported by a negative (positive) nonlinearity.\n", "  The prospects are explored for testing Lorentz- and CPT-violating quantum\nelectrodynamics in experiments with Penning traps. We present the Lagrange\ndensity of Lorentz-violating spinor electrodynamics with operators of mass\ndimensions up to six, and we discuss some of its properties. The theory is used\nto derive Lorentz- and CPT-violating perturbative shifts of the energy levels\nof a particle confined to a Penning trap. Observable signals are discussed for\ntrapped electrons, positrons, protons, and antiprotons. Existing experimental\nmeasurements on anomaly frequencies are used to extract new or improved bounds\non numerous coefficients for Lorentz and CPT violation, using sidereal\nvariations of observables and comparisons between particles and antiparticles.\n", "  Cold atomic ensembles and spinor Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) are\npotential candidates for quantum memories as they have long coherence times and\ncan be coherently controlled. Unlike most candidates for quantum memories which\nare genuine or effective single particle systems, in atomic ensembles the\nquantum information is stored as a spin coherent state involving a very large\nnumber of atoms. A typical task with such ensembles is to drive the state\ntowards a particular quantum state. While such quantum control methods are\nwell-developed for qubit systems, it is a non-trivial task to extend quantum\ncontrol methods to the many-particle case. The objective of this work is to\ndeterministically steer an arbitrary state of the atomic ensemble into a\ndesired spin coherent state. To this end, we design our control law using\nstochastic stability theory, the quantum filtering theorem, and phase contrast\nimaging. We apply our control laws to different axes and show that it is\npossible to manipulate the atoms into different target states.\n", "  Crucial information on the mass accretion-ejection in young stars can be\nobtained from high spatial resolution images of jets in sources with recurrent\naccretion outbursts. Using the SPHERE/ZIMPOL instrument, we observed the young\nbinary Z CMa that is composed of a Herbig Be star and a FUor object, both\ndriving a jet. We analyse the structure of the two jets in relation with\nprevious accretion events observed in this target. We obtained optical images\nin the Halpha and OI 6300A lines at the unprecedented angular resolution of\n~0.03 arcsec, on which we have performed both continuum subtraction and\ndeconvolution, thereby deriving results that are consistent with each other.\nOur images reveal extended emission from both sources: a fairly compact and\npoorly collimated emission SW of the Herbig component and an extended\ncollimated and precessing jet from the FUor component. The compact emission\nfrom the Herbig star is compatible with a wide-angle wind and is possibly\nconnected to the recent outburst events shown by this component. The FUor jet\nis traced down to 70 mas (80 AU) from the source and is highly collimated with\na width of 26-48 AU at distances 100-200 AU, which is similar to the width of\njets from T Tauri stars. This strongly suggests that the same\nmagneto-centrifugal jet-launching mechanism also operates in FUors. The\nobserved jet wiggle can be modelled as originating from an orbital motion with\na period of 4.2 yr around an unseen companion with mass between 0.48 and 1\nMsun. The jet mass loss rate Mloss was derived from the OI luminosity and is in\nthe range 1E-8 and 1E-6 Msun/yr. This is the first direct Mloss measurement\nfrom a jet in a FUor. If we assume previous Macc estimates obtained through\nmodelling of the accretion disk, the derived range of Mloss would imply a very\nlow mass-ejection efficiency (Mloss/Macc < 0.02), which is lower than that\ntypical of T Tauri stars.\n", "  Massive stars, multiple stellar systems and clusters are born from the\ngravitational collapse of massive dense gaseous clumps, and the way these\nsystems form strongly depends on how the parent clump fragments into cores\nduring collapse. Numerical simulations show that magnetic fields may be the key\ningredient in regulating fragmentation. Here we present ALMA observations at\n~0.25'' resolution of the thermal dust continuum emission at ~278 GHz towards a\nturbulent, dense, and massive clump, IRAS 16061-5048c1, in a very early\nevolutionary stage. The ALMA image shows that the clump has fragmented into\nmany cores along a filamentary structure. We find that the number, the total\nmass and the spatial distribution of the fragments are consistent with\nfragmentation dominated by a strong magnetic field. Our observations support\nthe theoretical prediction that the magnetic field plays a dominant role in the\nfragmentation process of massive turbulent clump.\n", "  A new, frequency modulation mechanism for zonal flow pattern formation is\npresented. The model predicts the probability distribution function of the flow\nstrength as well as the evolution of the characteristic spatial scale. Magnetic\ntoroidicity-induced global phase dynamics is shown to determine the spatial\nstructure of the flow. A key result is the observation that global phase\npatterning can lead to zonal flow formation in the absence of turbulence\ninhomogeneity.\n", "  We present new results on [CII]158$\\mu$ m emission from four galaxies in the\nreionization epoch. These galaxies were previously confirmed to be at redshifts\nbetween 6.6 and 7.15 from the presence of the Ly$\\alpha$ emission line in their\nspectra. The Ly$\\alpha$ emission line is redshifted by 100-200 km/s compared to\nthe systemic redshift given by the [CII] line. These velocity offsets are\nsmaller than what is observed in z~3 Lyman break galaxies with similar UV\nluminosities and emission line properties. Smaller velocity shifts reduce the\nvisibility of Ly$\\alpha$ and hence somewhat alleviate the need for a very\nneutral IGM at z~7 to explain the drop in the fraction of Ly$\\alpha$ emitters\nobserved at this epoch.\n  The galaxies show [CII] emission with L[CII]=0.6-1.6 x10$^8 L_\\odot$: these\nluminosities place them consistently below the SFR-L[CII] relation observed for\nlow redshift star forming and metal poor galaxies and also below z =5.5 Lyman\nbreak galaxies with similar star formation rates. We argue that previous\nundetections of [CII] in z~7 galaxies with similar or smaller star formation\nrates are due to selection effects: previous targets were mostly strong\nLy$\\alpha$ emitters and therefore probably metal poor systems, while our\ngalaxies are more representative of the general high redshift star forming\npopulation .\n", "  Non-linear phenomena in optically excited semiconductor structures are of\nhigh interest. We here develop a model capable of studying the dynamics of the\nphotoexcited carriers, including Coulomb interaction on a Hartree-Fock level,\non the same footing as the dynamics of the light field impinging on an\narbitrary photonic structure. Applying this method to calculate the third\nharmonic generation in a semiconductor quantum well embedded in a Bragg mirror\nstructure, we find that the power-law exponent of the intensity dependence of\nthe third harmonic generation depends on the frequency of the exciting pulse.\nOff-resonant pulses follow the expected cubic dependence, while the exponent is\nsmaller for resonant pulses due to saturation effects in the induced carrier\ndensity. Our study provides a detailed understanding of the carrier and light\nfield dynamics during non-linear processes.\n", "  Polarization is a powerful diagnostic tool to constrain the site of the\nhigh-energy pulsed emission and particle acceleration in gamma-ray pulsars.\nRecent particle-in-cell simulations of pulsar magnetosphere suggest that\nhigh-energy emission results from particles accelerated in the equatorial\ncurrent sheet emitting synchrotron radiation. In this study, we re-examine the\nsimulation data to compute the phase-resolved polarization properties. We find\nthat the emission is mildly polarized and that there is an anticorrelation\nbetween the flux and the degree of linear polarization (on-pulse: ~15%,\noff-pulse: ~30%). The decrease of polarization during pulses is mainly\nattributed to the formation of caustics in the current sheet. Each pulse of\nlight is systematically accompanied by a rapid swing of the polarization angle\ndue to the change of the magnetic polarity when the line of sight passes\nthrough the current sheet. The optical polarization pattern observed in the\nCrab can be well-reproduced for a pulsar inclination angle ~60 degrees and an\nobserver viewing angle ~130 degrees. The predicted high-energy polarization is\na robust feature of the current sheet emitting scenario which can be tested by\nfuture X-ray and gamma-ray polarimetry instruments.\n", "  Effective transition between the population-inverted optical eigenmodes of\ntwo coupled microcavities carrying mechanical oscillation realizes a phonon\nanalogue of optical two-level laser. By providing an approach that linearizes\nthe dynamical equations of weak nonlinear systems without relying on their\nsteady states, we study such phonon laser action as a realistic dynamical\nprocess, which exhibits time-dependent stimulated phonon field amplification\nespecially when one of the cavities is added with optical gain medium. The\napproach we present explicitly gives the conditions for the optimum phonon\nlasing, and thermal noise is found to be capable of facilitating the phonon\nlaser action significantly.\n", "  The formation and evolution of giant molecular clouds (GMCs) in spiral\ngalaxies have been investigated in the traditional framework of the combined\nquasi-stationary density wave and galactic shock model. However, our\nunderstanding of the dynamics of spiral arms is changing from the traditional\nspiral model to a dynamically evolving spiral model. In this study, we\ninvestigate the structure and evolution of GMCs in a dynamically evolving\nspiral arm using a three-dimensional N-body/hydrodynamic simulation of a barred\nspiral galaxy at parsec-scale resolution. This simulation incorporated\nself-gravity, molecular hydrogen formation, radiative cooling, heating due to\ninterstellar far-ultraviolet radiation, and stellar feedback by both HII\nregions and Type-II supernovae. In contrast to a simple expectation based on\nthe traditional spiral model, the GMCs exhibited no systematic evolutionary\nsequence across the spiral arm. Our simulation showed that the GMCs behaved as\nhighly dynamic objects with eventful lives involving collisional build-up,\ncollision-induced star formation, and destruction via stellar feedback. The GMC\nlifetimes were predicted to be short, only a few tens of millions years. We\nalso found that, at least at the resolutions and with the feedback models used\nin this study, most of the GMCs without HII regions were collapsing, but half\nof the GMCs with HII regions were expanding owing to the HII-region feedback\nfrom stars within them. Our results support the dynamic and feedback-regulated\nGMC evolution scenario. Although the simulated GMCs were converging rather than\nvirial equilibrium, they followed the observed scaling relationship well. We\nalso analysed the effects of galactic tides and external pressure on GMC\nevolution and suggested that GMCs cannot be regarded as isolated systems since\ntheir evolution in disc galaxies is complicated because of these environmental\neffects.\n", "  We present for the first time evidence for the existence of a dynamically\nrefracted primary bow for $^{9}$Be+$^{16}$O scattering. This is demonstrated\nthrough the use of coupled channel calculations with an extended double folding\npotential derived from the density-dependent effective two-body force and\nprecise microscopic cluster wave functions for $^{9}$Be. The calculations\nreproduce the experimental Airy structure in $^{9}$Be+$^{16}$O scattering\nwell.It is found that coupling of a weakly bound $^{9}$Be nucleus to excited\nstates plays the role of a booster lens, dynamically enhancing the refraction\nover the {\\it static} refraction due to the Luneburg lens mean field potential\nbetween the ground states of $^{9}$Be and $^{16}$O.\n", "  We analyze the impact of finite-time singularities on gravitational waves, in\nthe context of $F(R)$ gravity. We investigate which singularities are allowed\nto occur during the inflationary era, when gravitational waves are considered,\nand we discuss the quantitative implications of each allowed singularity. As we\nshow, only a pressure singularity, the so-called Type II and also a Type IV\nsingularity are allowed to occur during the inflationary era. In the case of a\nType II, the resulting amplitude of the gravitational wave is zero or almost\nzero, hence this pressure singularity has a significant impact on the\nprimordial gravitational waves. The case of a Type IV singularity is more\ninteresting since as we show, the singularity has no effect on the amplitude of\nthe gravitational waves. Therefore, this result combined with the fact that the\nType IV singularity affects only the dynamics of inflation, leads to the\nconclusion that the Universe passes smoothly through a Type IV singularity.\n", "  We investigate the nature of the compact, and possibly variable nuclear radio\nsource in the centre of WISE J0716-19, the proposed host galaxy of fast radio\nburst, FRB 150418. We observed WISE J0716-19 at 5.0 GHz with the European VLBI\nNetwork four times between 2016 March 16 and June 2. At three epochs, we\nsimultaneously observed the source with e-MERLIN at the same frequency. We\ndetected a compact source in the EVN data in each epoch with a significance up\nto ~8sigma. The four epochs yielded consistent results within their\nuncertainties, for both peak surface intensity and positions. The mean values\nfor these quantities are I_peak = (115+-9) {\\mu}Jy/beam and r.a. =\n07:16:34.55496(7), dec. = -19:00:39.4754(8), respectively. The e-MERLIN data\nprovided ~3-5sigma detections, at a position consistent with those of the EVN\ndata. The presence of emission on angular scales intermediate between the EVN\nand e-MERLIN is consistent with being null. The brightness temperature of the\nEVN core is Tb~10^8.5K, close to the value required by Akiyama & Johnson (2016)\nto explain the radio properties of WISE J0716-19 in terms of interstellar\ninduced short-term variability. Our observations provide direct, independent\nevidence of the existence of a nuclear compact source in WISE J0716-19, a\nphysical scenario with no evident connection with FRB 150418. However, the EVN\ndata do not show indication of the variability observed with the VLA.\n", "  23 giant flares from 13 active stars (eight RS CVn systems, one Algol system,\nthree dMe stars and one YSO) were detected during the first two years of our\nall-sky X-ray monitoring with the gas propotional counters (GSC) of the Monitor\nof All-sky X-ray Image (MAXI). The observed parameters of all of these MAXI/GSC\nflares are found to be at the upper ends for stellar flares with the luminosity\nof 10^(31-34) ergs s-1 in the 2-20 keV band, the emission measure of 10^(54-57)\ncm-3, the e-folding time of 1 hour to 1.5 days, and the total radiative energy\nreleased during the flare of 10^(34-39) ergs. Notably, the peak X-ray\nluminosity of 5(3-9)*10^33 ergs s-1 in the 2-20 keV band was detected in one of\nthe flares on II Peg, which is one of the, or potentially the, largest ever\nobserved in stellar flares. X-ray flares were detected from GT Mus, V841 Cen,\nSZ Psc, and TWA-7 for the first time in this survey. Whereas most of our\ndetected sources are multiple-star systems, two of them are single stars (YZ\nCMi and TWA-7). Among the stellar sources within 100 pc distance, the MAXI/GSC\nsources have larger rotation velocities than the other sources. This suggests\nthat the rapid rotation velocity may play a key role in generating large\nflares. Combining the X-ray flare data of nearby stars and the sun, taken from\nliterature and our own data, we discovered a universal correlation of\ntau~L_X^0.2 for the flare duration tau and the intrinsic X-ray luminosity L_X\nin the 0.1-100 keV band, which holds for 5 and 12 orders of magnitude in tau\nand L_X, respectively. The MAXI/GSC sample is located at the highest ends on\nthe correlation.\n", "  Context. The majority of bright extragalactic gamma-ray sources are blazars.\nOnly a few radio galaxies have been detected by Fermi/LAT. Recently, the\nGHz-peaked spectrum source PKS 1718-649 was confirmed to be gamma-ray bright,\nproviding further evidence for the existence of a population of gamma-ray loud,\ncompact radio galaxies. A spectral turnover in the radio spectrum in the MHz to\nGHz range is a characteristic feature of these objects, which are thought to be\nyoung due to their small linear sizes. The multiwavelength properties of the\ngamma-ray source PMN J1603-4904 suggest that it is a member of this source\nclass. Aims. The known radio spectrum of PMN J1603-4904 can be described by a\npower law above 1 GHz. Using observations from the Giant Metrewave Radio\nTelescope (GMRT) at 150, 325, and 610 MHz, we investigate the behaviour of the\nspectrum at lower frequencies to search for a low-frequency turnover. Methods.\nData from the TIFR GMRT Sky Survey (TGSS ADR) catalogue and archival GMRT\nobservations were used to construct the first MHz to GHz spectrum of PMN\nJ1603-4904. Results. We detect a low-frequency turnover of the spectrum and\nmeasure the peak position at about 490 MHz (rest-frame), which, using the known\nrelation of peak frequency and linear size, translates into a maximum linear\nsource size of ~1.4 kpc. Conclusions. The detection of the MHz peak indicates\nthat PMN J1603-4904 is part of this population of radio galaxies with turnover\nfrequencies in the MHz to GHz regime. Therefore it can be considered the\nsecond, confirmed object of this kind detected in gamma-rays. Establishing this\ngamma-ray source class will help to investigate the gamma-ray production sites\nand to test broadband emission models.\n", "  We demonstrate, on the basis of molecular dynamics simulations, the\npossibility of an efficient water-ethanol separation using nanoporous carbon\nmembranes, namely carbon nanotube membranes, nanoporous graphene sheets, and\nmultilayer graphene membranes. While these carbon membranes are in general\npermeable to both pure liquids, they exhibit a counter-intuitive\n\"self-semi-permeability\" to water in the presence of water-ethanol mixtures.\nThis originates in a preferred ethanol adsorption in nanoconfinement that\nprevents water molecules from entering the carbon nanopores. An osmotic\npressure is accordingly expressed across the carbon membranes for the\nwater-ethanol mixture, which agrees with the classic van't Hoff type\nexpression. This suggests a robust and versatile membrane-based separation,\nbuilt on a pressure-driven reverse-osmosis process across these carbon-based\nmembranes. In particular, the recent development of large-scale\n'graphene-oxide' like membranes then opens an avenue for a versatile and\nefficient ethanol dehydration using this separation process, with possible\napplication for bio-ethanol fabrication.\n", "  We provide a detailed microscopic characterization of the influence of\ndefects-induced disorder onto the Dirac spectrum of three dimensional\ntopological insulators. By spatially resolved Landau-levels spectroscopy\nmeasurements, we reveal the existence of nanoscale fluctuations of both the\nDirac point energy as well as of the Dirac-fermions velocity which is found to\nspatially change in opposite direction for electrons and holes, respectively.\nThese results evidence a scenario which goes beyond the existing picture based\non chemical potential fluctuations. The findings are consistently explained by\nconsidering the microscopic effects of local stain introduced by defects, which\nour model calculations show to effectively couple to topological states,\nreshaping their Dirac-like dispersion over a large energy range. In particular,\nour results indicate that the presence of microscopic spatially varying stain,\ninevitably present in crystals because of the random distribution of defects,\neffectively couple to topological states and should be carefully considered for\ncorrectly describing the effects of disorder.\n", "  The central structure in three of the brightest unlensed z=3-4 submillimeter\ngalaxies are investigated through 0.015\" - 0.05\" (120 -- 360~pc) 860 micron\ncontinuum images obtained using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter\nArray (ALMA). The distribution in the central kpc in AzTEC1 and AzTEC8 are\nextremely complex, and they are composed of multiple ~200 pc clumps. AzTEC4\nconsists of two sources that are separated by ~1.5 kpc, indicating a mid-stage\nmerger. The peak star formation rate densities in the central clumps are ~300 -\n3000 Msun/yr/kpc^2, suggesting regions with extreme star formation near the\nEddington Limit. By comparing the flux obtained by ALMA and Submillimeter Array\n(SMA), we find that 68-90% of the emission is extended (> 1 kpc) in AzTEC 4 and\n8. For AzTEC1, we identify at least 11 additional compact (~200 pc) clumps in\nthe extended 3 - 4 kpc region. Overall, the data presented here suggest that\nthe luminosity surface densities observed at < 150 pc scales are roughly\nsimilar to that observed in local ULIRGs, as in the eastern nucleus of Arp 220.\nBetween 10 to 30% of the 860 micron continuum is concentrated in clumpy\nstructures in the central kpc while the remaining flux is distributed over > 1\nkpc regions, some of which could also be clumpy. These sources can be explained\nby a rapid inflow of gas such as a merger of gas-rich galaxies, surrounded by\nextended and clumpy starbursts. However, the cold mode accretion model is not\nruled out.\n", "  We study the interplay of conductive and radiative heat transfer (RHT) in\nplanar geometries and predict that temperature gradients induced by radiation\ncan play a significant role on the behavior of RHT with respect to gap sizes,\ndepending largely on geometric and material parameters and not so crucially on\noperating temperatures. Our findings exploit rigorous calculations based on a\nclosed-form expression for the heat flux between two plates separated by vacuum\ngaps $d$ and subject to arbitrary temperature profiles, along with an\napproximate but accurate analytical treatment of coupled conduction--radiation\nin this geometry. We find that these effects can be prominent in typical\nmaterials (e.g. silica and sapphire) at separations of tens of nanometers, and\ncan play an even larger role in metal oxides, which exhibit moderate\nconductivities and enhanced radiative properties. Broadly speaking, these\npredictions suggest that the impact of RHT on thermal conduction, and vice\nversa, could manifest itself as a limit on the possible magnitude of RHT at the\nnanoscale, which asymptotes to a constant (the conductive transfer rate when\nthe gap is closed) instead of diverging at short separations.\n", "  We studied the characteristic physical properties and behavior of broadband\nmicrowave sub-second pulsations observed in an expanding coronal loop during\nthe GOES C2.4 solar flare on 2011 August 10. We found sub-second pulsations and\nother different burst groups in the complex radio spectrum. The broadband\n(bandwidth about 1 GHz) sub-second pulsations (temporal period range 0.07-1.49\ns, no characteristic dominant period) lasted 70 s in the frequency range 4-7\nGHz. These pulsations were not correlated at their individual frequencies, had\nno measurable frequency drift, and zero polarization. In these pulsations, we\nfound the signatures of fast sausage magnetoacoustic waves with the\ncharacteristic periods of 0.7 and 2 s. The other radio bursts showed their\ncharacteristic frequency drifts in the range of -262-520 MHz/s. They helped us\nto derive average values of 20-80 G for the coronal magnetic field strength in\nthe place of radio emission. It was revealed that the microwave event belongs\nto an expanding coronal loop with twisted sub-structures observed in the 131,\n94, and 193 A SDO/AIA channels. Their slit-time diagrams were compared with the\nlocation of the radio source at 5.7 GHz to realize that the EUV intensity of\nthe expanding loop increased just before the radio source triggering. We reveal\ntwo EUV bidirectional flows that are linked with the start time of the loop\nexpansion. Their positions were close to the radio source and propagated with\nvelocities within a range of 30-117 km/s. We demonstrate that periodic regime\nof the electron acceleration in a model of the quasi-periodic magnetic\nreconnection might be able to explain physical properties and behavior of the\nsub-second pulsations. The depolarization process of the microwave emission\nmight be caused by a plasma turbulence in the radio source. Finally, the\nobserved EUV flows might be linked with reconnection outflows.\n", "  Due to observational challenges our knowledge of low-level accretion flows\naround neutron stars is limited. We present Nustar, Swift and Chandra\nobservations of the low-mass X-ray binary IGR J17062-6143, which has been\npersistently accreting at ~0.1 per cent of the Eddington limit since 2006. Our\nsimultaneous Nustar/Swift observations show that the 0.5-79 keV spectrum can be\ndescribed by a combination of a power law with a photon index of Gamma~2, a\nblack body with a temperature of kT_bb~0.5 keV (presumably arising from the\nneutron star surface), and disk reflection. Modeling the reflection spectrum\nsuggests that the inner accretion disk was located at R_in>100 GM/c2 (>225 km)\nfrom the neutron star. The apparent truncation may be due to evaporation of the\ninner disk into a radiatively-inefficient accretion flow, or due to the\npressure of the neutron star magnetic field. Our Chandra gratings data reveal\npossible narrow emission lines near 1 keV that can be modeled as reflection or\ncollisionally-ionized gas, and possible low-energy absorption features that\ncould point to the presence of an outflow. We consider a scenario in which this\nneutron star has been able to sustain its low accretion rate through magnetic\ninhibition of the accretion flow, which gives some constraints on its magnetic\nfield strength and spin period. In this configuration, IGR J17062-6143 could\nexhibit a strong radio jet as well as a (propeller-driven) wind-like outflow.\n", "  We investigate the integrated far-ultraviolet (FUV) emission from globular\nclusters. We present new FUV photometry of M~87's clusters based on archival\nHST WFPC2 F170W observations. We use these data to test the reliability of\npublished photometry based on HST STIS FUV-MAMA observations, which are now\nknown to suffer from significant red-leak. We generally confirm these previous\nFUV detections, but suggest they may be somewhat fainter. We compare the FUV\nemission from bright ($M_{V} < -9.0$) clusters in the Milky Way, M~31, M~81 and\nM~87 to each other and to the predictions from stellar populations models.\nMetal-rich globular clusters show a large spread in FUV-V, with some clusters\nin M~31, M~81 and M~87 being much bluer than standard predictions. This\nrequires that some metal-rich clusters host a significant population of\nblue/extreme horizontal branch (HB) stars. These hot HB stars are not\ntraditionally expected in metal-rich environments, but are a natural\nconsequence of multiple populations in clusters - since the enriched population\nis observed to be He-enhanced and will therefore produce bluer HB stars, even\nat high metallicity. We conclude that the observed FUV emission from metal-rich\nclusters in M~31, M~81 and M~87 provides evidence that He-enhanced second\npopulations, similar to those observed directly in the Milky Way, may be a\nubiquitous feature of globular clusters in the local universe. Future HST FUV\nphotometry is required to both confirm our interpretation of these archival\ndata and provide constraints on He-enriched second populations of stars in\nextra-galactic globular clusters.\n", "  After a long low-activity period, a gamma-ray flare from the narrow-line\nSeyfert 1 PKS 1502+036 (z=0.4089) was detected by the Large Area Telescope\n(LAT) on board Fermi in 2015. On 2015 December 20 the source reached a daily\npeak flux, in the 0.1-300 GeV band, of (93 $\\pm$ 19) $\\times$10$^{-8}$ ph\ncm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, attaining a flux of (237 $\\pm$ 71) $\\times$10$^{-8}$ ph\ncm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ on 3-hr time-scales, which corresponds to an isotropic\nluminosity of (7.3 $\\pm$ 2.1) $\\times$10$^{47}$ erg/s. The gamma-ray flare was\nnot accompanied by significant spectral changes. We report on multi-wavelength\nradio-to-gamma-ray observations of PKS 1502+036 during 2008 August-2016 March\nby Fermi-LAT, Swift, XMM-Newton, Catalina Real-Time Transient Survey, and the\nOwens Valley Radio Observatory (OVRO). An increase in activity was observed on\n2015 December 22 by Swift in optical, UV, and X-rays. The OVRO 15 GHz light\ncurve reached the highest flux density observed from this source on 2016\nJanuary 12, indicating a delay of about three weeks between the gamma-ray and\n15 GHz emission peaks. This suggests that the gamma-ray emitting region is\nlocated beyond the broad line region. We compared the spectral energy\ndistribution (SED) of an average activity state with that of the flaring state.\nThe two SED, with the high-energy bump modelled as an external Compton\ncomponent with seed photons from a dust torus, could be fitted by changing the\nelectron distribution parameters as well as the magnetic field. The fit of the\ndisc emission during the average state constrains the black hole mass to values\nlower than 10$^8$ solar masses. The SED, high-energy emission mechanisms, and\ngamma-ray properties of the source resemble those of a flat spectrum radio\nquasar.\n", "  We analyze photometry from deep B-band images of 59 void galaxies in the Void\nGalaxy Survey (VGS), together with their near-infrared 3.6$\\mu$m and 4.5$\\mu$m\nSpitzer photometry. The VGS galaxies constitute a sample of void galaxies that\nwere selected by a geometric-topological procedure from the SDSS DR7 data\nrelease, and which populate the deep interior of voids. Our void galaxies span\na range of absolute B-magnitude from $\\rm{M_B=-15.5}$ to $\\rm{M_B=-20}$, while\nat the 3.6$\\mu$m band their magnitudes range from $\\rm{M_{3.6}=-18}$ to\n$\\rm{M_{3.6}=-24}$. Their B-[3.6] colour and structural parameters indicate\nthese are star forming galaxies. A good reflection of the old stellar\npopulation, the near-infrared band photometry also provide a robust estimate of\nthe stellar mass, which for the VGS galaxies we confirm to be smaller than $3\n\\times 10^{10}$ M$_\\odot$. In terms of the structural parameters and\nmorphology, our findings align with other studies in that our VGS galaxy sample\nconsists mostly of small late-type galaxies. Most of them are similar to Sd-Sm\ngalaxies, although a few are irregularly shaped galaxies. The sample even\nincludes two early-type galaxies, one of which is an AGN. Their S\\'{e}rsic\nindices are nearly all smaller than $n=2$ in both bands and they also have\nsmall half-light radii. In all, we conclude that the principal impact of the\nvoid environment on the galaxies populating them mostly concerns their low\nstellar mass and small size.\n", "  We investigate test-particle diffusion in dynamical turbulence based on a\nnumerical approach presented before. For the turbulence we employ the nonlinear\nanisotropic dynamical turbulence model which takes into account wave\npropagation effects as well as damping effects. We compute numerically\ndiffusion coefficients of energetic particles along and across the mean\nmagnetic field. We focus on turbulence and particle parameters which should be\nrelevant for the solar system and compare our findings with different\ninterplanetary observations. We vary different parameters such as the\ndissipation range spectral index, the ratio of the turbulence bendover scales,\nand the magnetic field strength in order to explore the relevance of the\ndifferent parameters. We show that the bendover scales as well as the magnetic\nfield ratio have a strong influence on diffusion coefficients whereas the\ninfluence of the dissipation range spectral index is weak. The best agreement\nwith solar wind observations can be found for equal bendover scales and a\nmagnetic field ratio of $\\delta$B/B0 = 0.75.\n", "  The mechanisms and processes of the formation of the regenerative soot in a\ngraphite hollow cathode discharge that produces and emits carbon clusters are\npresented. Mass spectrometry with a designed ExB velocity filter analyzes the\nentire range of the charged clusters from monatomic Carbon C1 to as large\nclusters as C4300. The state of the carbon vapor within the source is evaluated\nby using the characteristic line emissions from the carbonaceous discharge\nwhose formative mechanisms depend upon the kinetic and potential sputtering of\nthe sooted cathode. The carbonaceous discharge generates atomic and ionic C and\nits clusters Cm where m is equal to or greater than 2, noble gas metastable\natoms and ions, energetic electrons and photons in the cavity of the graphite\nhollow cathode. The parameters of soot formation and its recycling depend\ncritically on the discharge parameters, the geometry of the hollow cathode and\n3D profile of the cusp magnetic field contours.\n", "  We report the mechanisms of production and the state of excitation of the\nneutral and singly charged monatomic carbon in the regenerative soot as a\nfunction of the discharge parameters in graphite hollow cathode (HC) sources.\nTwo distinctly different source configurations have been investigated.\nComparisons of the level densities of various charged states of C1 have\nidentified the regenerative properties of the C radicals in graphite HC soot.\n", "  The mechanisms for population inversion among the excited states of He I and\nNe I in regenerative sooting discharges have been investigated as a function of\nthe geometry and the physical parameters of the graphite hollow cathode\nsources. The effect of the state of sooting of the hollow cathode, the gas\npressure and the role of the cycling of the discharge current idis on the\npopulation inversion of the excited He I and Ne I levels have been\ninvestigated.\n", "  Based on the recently completed {\\it Chandra}/ACIS survey of X-ray point\nsources in nearby galaxies, we study the X-ray luminosity functions (XLFs) for\nX-ray point sources in different types of galaxies and the statistical\nproperties of ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs). Uniform procedures are\ndeveloped to compute the detection threshold, to estimate the\nforeground/background contamination, and to calculate the XLFs for individual\ngalaxies and groups of galaxies, resulting in an XLF library for 343 galaxies\nof different types. With the large number of surveyed galaxies, we have studied\nthe XLFs and ULX properties across different host galaxy types, and confirm\nwith good statistics that the XLF slope flattens from lenticular\n($\\alpha\\sim1.50\\pm0.07$) to elliptical ($\\sim1.21\\pm0.02$), to spirals\n($\\sim0.80\\pm0.02$), to peculiars ($\\sim0.55\\pm0.30$), and to irregulars\n($\\sim0.26\\pm0.10$). The XLF break dividing the neutron star and black hole\nbinaries is also confirmed, albeit at quite different break luminosities for\ndifferent types of galaxies. A radial dependency is found for ellipticals, with\na flatter XLF slope for sources located between $D_{25}$ and 2$D_{25}$,\nsuggesting the XLF slopes in the outer region of early-type galaxies are\ndominated by low-mass X-ray binaries in globular clusters. This study shows\nthat the ULX rate in early-type galaxies is $0.24\\pm0.05$ ULXs per surveyed\ngalaxy, on a $5\\sigma$ confidence level. The XLF for ULXs in late-type galaxies\nextends smoothly until it drops abruptly around $4\\times10^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$,\nand this break may suggest a mild boundary between the stellar black hole\npopulation possibly including 30 $M_\\odot$ black holes with super-Eddington\nradiation and intermediate mass black holes.\n", "  An all carbon hollow cathode ion source with a specially designed cusp\nmagnetic field Bz as a function of radius and theta is described. Velocity\nspectra from this source has shown that carbon cluster synthesis is taking\nplace as a function of the source design, discharge parameters and the state of\nsooting. The cusp magnetic field seems to establish two distinct discharge\nregions within the source. The first is a narrow annular ring that is 2 mm\nthick and 15-20 mm long with restricted axial and radial extent of the cusp\nfield. Here the source gas ionizes. The carbon atoms sputter of the cathode\nwalls and subsequently get ionized. The other one is a cylindrical plasma\nregion with the entire axial range of Bz. In this region the dynamics of the\nsoot formation from the plasma constituent on the cathode walls seems to be\nrelated to the carbon clustering processes\n", "  We studied the short proton free induction decay signals and the broad ^1H\nNMR spectra of Mg(OH)2 and Ca(OH)2 powders at 77-355 K and 42 MHz using pulsed\nNMR techniques. Using a Gaussian-type back extrapolation procedure for the\nobscured data of the proton free induction decay signals, we obtained more\nprecise values of the second moments of the Fourier-transformed broad NMR\nspectra than those in a previous report [Y. Itoh and M. Isobe, J. Phys. Soc.\nJpn. Vol. 84, 113601 (2015)] and compared with the theoretical second moments.\nThe decrease in the second moment could not account for the large decrease in\nthe magnitude of the intrinsic proton spin-lattice relaxation rate 1/T_1 from\nMg(OH)2 to Ca(OH)2. The analysis of 1/T_1 $propto$ exp(-E_g/k_BT) with E_g~0.01\neV points to a local hopping mechanism, and that of 1/T_1 $propto$ T^n with\nn~0.5 points to an anharmonic rattling mechanism.\n", "  We investigate the matter distribution of a spiral galaxy with a\ncounter-rotating stellar core, SDSS J1331+3628 (J1331), independently with\ngravitational lensing and stellar dynamical modelling. By fitting a\ngravitational potential model to a quadruplet of lensing images around J1331's\nbulge, we tightly constrain the mass inside the Einstein radius R_ein = (0.91\n+/- 0.02)'' (~= 1.83 +/- 0.04 kpc) to within 4%: M_ein = (7.8 +/- 0.3) x 10^10\nM_Sun. We model observed long-slit major axis stellar kinematics in J1331's\ncentral regions by finding Multi-Gaussian Expansion (MGE) models for the\nstellar and dark matter distribution that solve the axisymmetric Jeans\nequations. The lens and dynamical model are independently derived, but in very\ngood agreement with each other around ~R_ein. We find that J1331's center\nrequires a steep total mass-to-light ratio gradient. A dynamical model\nincluding an NFW halo (with virial velocity v_200 ~= 240 +/- 40 km/s and\nconcentration c_200 ~= 8 +/- 2) and moderate tangential velocity anisotropy\n(beta_z ~= -0.4 +/- 0.1) can reproduce the signatures of J1331's\ncounter-rotating core and predict the stellar and gas rotation curve at larger\nradii. However, our models do not agree with the observed velocity dispersion\nat large radii. We speculate that the reason could be a non-trivial change in\nstructure and kinematics due to a possible merger event in J1331's recent past.\n", "  An ExB velocity filter is described that has been used for the detection and\ndiagnostics of large carbon clusters Cm (where m is up to ten thousand). The\nvelocity and momentum analyses are compared for our special experimental\narrangement. We describe the variability of the resolving power of our compact\nvelocity filter as the main advantage over other comparable mass analysis\ntechniques.\n", "  We investigate the physical properties of \\textit{Fermi} TeV BL Lac objects\njets by modeling the quasi-simultaneous spectral energy distribution of 29\n\\textit{Fermi} TeV BL Lacs in the frame of a one-zone leptonic synchrotron\nself-Compton model. Our main results are the following: (i) There is a negative\ncorrelation between $B$ and $\\delta$ in our sample, which suggests that $B$ and\n$\\delta$ are dependent on each other mainly in Thomson regime. (ii) There are\nnegative correlations between $\\nu_{\\text{sy}}$ and $r$, the $\\nu_{\\text{IC}}$\nand $r$, which is a signature of the energy-dependence statistical acceleration\nor the stochastic acceleration. There is a significant correlation between $r$\nand $s$, which suggests that the curvature of the electron energy distribution\nis attributed to the energy-dependence statistical acceleration mechanism.\n(iii) By assuming one proton per relativistic electron, we estimate the jet\npower and radiative power. A size relation $P_{\\text{e}} \\sim P_{\\text{p}} >\nP_{\\text{r}} \\gtrsim P_{\\text{B}}$ is found in our sample. The\n$P_{\\text{e}}>P_{\\text{B}}$ suggests that the jets are particle dominated, and\nthe $P_{\\text{e}}\\sim P_{\\text{p}}$ means that the mean energy of relativistic\nelectrons approaches $m_{\\text{p}}/m_{\\text{e}}$. There are not significant\ncorrelations between $P_{\\text{jet}}$ and black hole mass in high or low state\nwith a sub-sample of 18 sources, which suggests that the jet power weakly\ndepends on the black hole mass. (iv) There is a correlation between the changes\nin the flux density at 1 TeV and the changes in the $\\gamma_{\\text{peak}}$,\nwhich suggests the change/evolution of electron energy distribution may be\nmainly responsible for the flux variation.\n", "  The XQ-100 survey has provided high signal-noise spectra of 100 redshift\n3-4.5 quasars with the X-Shooter spectrograph. The metal abundances for 13\nelements in the 41 damped Lyman alpha systems (DLAs) identified in the XQ-100\nsample are presented, and an investigation into abundances of a variety of DLA\nclasses is conducted. The XQ-100 DLA sample contains five DLAs within 5000 km/s\nof their host quasar (proximate DLAs; PDLAs) as well as three sightlines which\ncontain two DLAs within 10,000 km/s of each other along the same line-of-sight\n(multiple DLAs; MDLAs). Combined with previous observations in the literature,\nwe demonstrate that PDLAs with logN(HI)<21.0 show lower [S/H] and [Fe/H]\n(relative to intervening systems with similar redshift and N(HI)), whilst\nhigher [S/H] and [Si/H] are seen in PDLAs with logN(HI)>21.0. These abundance\ndiscrepancies are independent of their line-of-sight velocity separation from\nthe host quasar, and the velocity width of the metal lines (v90). Contrary to\nprevious studies, MDLAs show no difference in [alpha/Fe] relative to single\nDLAs matched in metallicity and redshift. In addition, we present follow-up\nUVES data of J0034+1639, a sightline containing three DLAs, including a\nmetal-poor DLA with [Fe/H]=-2.82 (the third lowest [Fe/H] in DLAs identified to\ndate) at z=4.25. Lastly we study the dust-corrected [Zn/Fe], emphasizing that\nnear-IR coverage of X-Shooter provides unprecedented access to MgII, CaII and\nTiII lines (at redshifts 3-4) to provide additional evidence for subsolar\n[Zn/Fe] ratio in DLAs.\n", "  We determine active gravitational mass operator of the simplest composite\nquantum body - a hydrogen atom - within the semiclassical approach to the\nEinstein equation for a gravitational field. We show that the expectation value\nof the mass is equivalent to energy for stationary quantum states. On the other\nhand, it occurs that, for quantum superpositions of stationary states with\nconstant expectation values of energy, the expectation values of the\ngravitational mass exhibit time-dependent oscillations. This breaks the\nequivalence between active gravitational mass and energy and can be observed as\na macroscopic effect for a macroscopic ensemble of coherent quantum states of\nthe atoms. The corresponding experiment could be the first direct observation\nof quantum effects in General Relativity.\n", "  Spin liquid is a state of electron spins in which quantum fluctuation breaks\nmagnetic ordering while maintaining spin correlation. It has been a central\ntopic in magnetism because of its relevance to high-Tc superconductivity and\ntopological states. However, utilizing spin liquid has been quite difficult.\nTypical spin liquid states are realized in one-dimensional spin systems, called\nquantum spin chains. Here, we show that a spin liquid in a spin-1/2 quantum\nchain generates and carries spin current via its long-range spin fluctuation.\nThis is demonstrated by observing an anisotropic negative spin Seebeck effect\nalong the spin chains in Sr2CuO3. The results show that spin current can flow\neven in an atomic channel owing the spin liquid state, which can be used for\natomic spin-current wiring.\n", "  We experimentally demonstrate a robust dynamical decoupling protocol with\nbounded controls using long soft pulses, eliminating a challenging requirement\nof strong control pulses in conventional implementations. This protocol is\naccomplished by designing the decoupling propagators to go through a Eulerian\ncycle of the coupler group [Phys. Rev. Lett. 90, 037901(2003)]. We demonstrate\nthat this Eulerian decoupling scheme increases the coherence time by two orders\nof magnitude in our experiment under either dephasing or a universal noise\nenvironment.\n", "  We present an analysis of the orientation effects in SDSS quasar composite\nspectra. In a previous work we have shown that the equivalent width EW of the\n[OIII] {\\lambda}5008{\\AA} line is a reliable indicator of the inclination of\nthe accretion disk. Here, we have selected a sample of ~15,000 quasars from the\nSDSS 7th Data Release and divided it in sub-samples with different values of\nEW([OIII]). We find inclination effects both on broad and narrow quasars\nemission lines, among which an increasing broadening from low to high EW for\nthe broad lines and a decreasing importance of the blue component for the\nnarrow lines. These effects are naturally explained with a variation of source\ninclination from nearly face-on to edge-on, confirming the goodness of\nEW([OIII]) as an orientation indicator. Moreover, we suggest that orientation\neffects could explain, at least partially, the origin of the anticorrelation\nbetween [OIII] and FeII intensities, i.e. the well known Eigenvector 1.\n", "  Following the interesting work of Ba\\~nados, Silk, and West [Phys. Rev. Lett.\n{\\bf 103}, 111102 (2009)], it is repeatedly stated in the physics literature\nthat the center-of-mass energy, ${\\cal E}_{\\text{c.m}}$, of two colliding\nparticles in a maximally rotating black-hole spacetime can grow unboundedly.\nFor this extreme scenario to happen, the particles have to collide at the\nblack-hole horizon. In this paper we show that Thorne's famous hoop conjecture\nprecludes this extreme scenario from occurring in realistic black-hole\nspacetimes. In particular, it is shown that a new (and larger) horizon is\nformed {\\it before} the infalling particles reach the horizon of the original\nblack hole. As a consequence, the center-of-mass energy of the collisional\nPenrose process is {\\it bounded} from above by the simple scaling relation\n${\\cal E}^{\\text{max}}_{\\text{c.m}}/2\\mu\\propto(M/\\mu)^{1/4}$, where $M$ and\n$\\mu$ are respectively the mass of the central black hole and the proper mass\nof the colliding particles.\n", "  Measurements of the energy spectra of multiply charged positive and negative\ncarbon ions recoiling from graphite surface under 100 and 150 keV argon and\nkrypton ion bombardment are presented. With the energy spectrometer set at\nrecoil angle of 79.5 degrees, direct recoil (DR) peaks have been observed with\nsingly as well as multiply charged carbon ions , where n = 1 to 6. These\nmonatomic and cluster ions have been observed recoiling with the characteristic\nrecoil energy E(DR) . We have observed sharp DR peaks. A collimated projectile\nbeam with small divergence is supplemented with a similar collimation before\nthe energy analyzer to reduce the background of sputtered ions due to scattered\nprojectiles.\n", "  Photoemission spectroscopy of the regenerative soot in neon's glow discharge\nplasma reveals the contributions from the sputtered atomic and molecular carbon\nspecies. We present the pattern of sputtering and the formation of monatomic C1\nand diatomic C2 as a function of the discharge current, the support gas\npressure and the number densities of the excited and ionized neon as the active\nconstituents of the carbonaceous plasma.\n", "  Charged rotating Kerr-Newman black holes are known to be superradiantly\nunstable to perturbations of charged massive bosonic fields whose proper\nfrequencies lie in the bounded regime $0 < \\omega < \\text{min}\n\\{\\omega_{\\text{c}} \\equiv m \\Omega_{\\text{H}} + q\\Phi_{\\text{H}},\\mu\\}$ [here\n$\\{\\Omega_{\\text{H}}, \\Phi_{\\text{H}}\\}$ are respectively the angular velocity\nand electric potential of the Kerr-Newman black hole, and $\\{m,q,\\mu\\}$ are\nrespectively the azimuthal harmonic index, the charge coupling constant, and\nthe proper mass of the field]. In this paper we study analytically the complex\nresonance spectrum which characterizes the dynamics of linearized charged\nmassive scalar fields in a near-extremal Kerr-Newman black-hole spacetime.\nInterestingly, it is shown that near the critical frequency $\\omega_{\\text{c}}$\nfor superradiant amplification and in the eikonal large-mass regime, the\nsuperradiant instability growth rates of the explosive scalar fields are\ncharacterized by a non-trivial (non-monotonic) dependence on the dimensionless\ncharge-to-mass ratio $q/\\mu$. In particular, for given parameters $\\{M,Q, J\\}$\nof the central Kerr-Newman black hole, we determine analytically the optimal\ncharge-to-mass ratio $q/\\mu$ of the explosive scalar field which {\\it\nmaximizes} the growth rate of the superradiant instabilities in the composed\nKerr-Newman-black-hole-charged-massive-scalar-field system.\n", "  The radiofrequency dielectric response of the lead-free\nBa(Zr$_{0.5}$Ti$_{0.5}$)O$_3$ relaxor ferroelectric is simulated using a\ncoarse-grained Hamiltonian. This concept, taken from Real-Space Renormalization\nGroup theories, allows depicting the collective behavior of correlated local\nmodes gathered in blocks. Free-energy barriers for their thermally activated\ncollective hopping are deduced from this {\\it ab-initio}-based approach, and\nused as input data of Kinetic Monte Carlo simulations. The resulting numerical\nscheme allows to simulate the dielectric response for external field\nfrequencies ranging from the kHz up to a few tens of MHz for the first time,\nand to, e.g., demonstrate that local (electric or elastic) random fields lead\nto the dielectric relaxation in the radiofrequency range that has been observed\nin relaxors.\n", "  We present initial work about attaining fitting formulas for the quick\ndetermination of the existence of S-type and P-type habitable zones in binary\nsystems. Following previous work, we calculate the limits of the climatological\nhabitable zone in binary systems (which sensitively depend on the system\nparameters) based on a joint constraint encompassing planetary orbital\nstability and a habitable region for a possible system planet. We also consider\nupdated results on planetary climate models previously obtained by Kopparapu\nand collaborators. Fitting equations based on our work are presented for\nselected cases.\n", "  A series of experiments has identified mechanisms of carbon nano- and\nmicro-structure formation at room temperature, without catalyst and in the\nenvironment of immiscible metallic surroundings. The structures include\nthreaded nano fibres, graphitic sheets and carbon onions. Copper as substrate\nwas used due to its immiscibility with carbon. Energetic carbon ions of 0.2-2.0\nMeV irradiated Cu targets. Cu substrates, apertures and 3 mm diameter\nTransmission Electron Microscope copper grids were implanted with the carbon.\nWe observed wide range of micrometer-size structures formed on Cu grids and\nalong the edges of the irradiated apertures. These are shown to be threaded\nnano fibers (TNF) of few micrometer thicknesses with lengths varying from 10 to\n3000 micrometer. Secondary electron microscopy (SEM) identifies the\nmicrometer-size structures while Confocal microscopy was used to learn about\nthe mechanisms by which C1+ irradiated Cu provides the growth environment. Huge\ncarbon onions of diameters ranging from hundreds of nm to {\\mu}m were observed\nin the as-grown and annealed samples. Transformations of the nanostructures\nwere observed under prolonged electron irradiations of SEM and TEM. One of the\nimmediate outcomes of our present study is relevant for the efforts to\nfabricate carbon onions with specific properties.\n", "  The B-W method is used to determine the distance of Cepheids and consists in\ncombining the angular size variations of the star, as derived from infrared\nsurface-brightness relations or interferometry, with its linear size variation,\nas deduced from visible spectroscopy using the projection factor. While many\nCepheids have been intensively observed by infrared beam combiners, only a few\nhave been observed in the visible. This paper is part of a project to observe\nCepheids in the visible with interferometry as a counterpart to infrared\nobservations already in hand. Observations of delta Cep itself were secured\nwith the VEGA/CHARA instrument over the full pulsation cycle of the star. These\nvisible interferometric data are consistent in first approximation with a\nquasi-hydrostatic model of pulsation surrounded by a static circumstellar\nenvironment (CSE) with a size of theta_cse=8.9 +/- 3.0 mas and a relative flux\ncontribution of f_cse=0.07+/-0.01. A model of visible nebula (a background\nsource filling the field of view of the interferometer) with the same relative\nflux contribution is also consistent with our data at small spatial\nfrequencies. However, in both cases, we find discrepancies in the squared\nvisibilities at high spatial frequencies (maximum 2sigma) with two different\nregimes over the pulsation cycle of the star, phi=0.0-0.8 and phi=0.8-1.0. We\nprovide several hypotheses to explain these discrepancies, but more\nobservations and theoretical investigations are necessary before a firm\nconclusion can be drawn. For the first time we have been able to detect in the\nvisible domain a resolved structure around delta~Cep. We have also shown that a\nsimple model cannot explain the observations, and more work will be necessary\nin the future, both on observations and modelling.\n", "  We present three-dimensional (3D) non-local thermodynamic equilibrium\n(non-LTE) radiative transfer calculations for silicon in the solar photosphere,\nusing an extensive model atom that includes recent, realistic neutral hydrogen\ncollisional cross-sections. We find that photon losses in the SiI lines give\nrise to slightly negative non-LTE abundance corrections of the order -0.01 dex.\nWe infer a 3D non-LTE based solar silicon abundance of 7.51 dex. With silicon\ncommonly chosen to be the anchor between the photospheric and meteoritic\nabundances, we find that the meteoritic abundance scale remains unchanged\ncompared with the Asplund et al. (2009) and Lodders et al. (2009) results.\n", "  Thick biological tissues give rise to not only the scattering of incoming\nlight waves, but also aberrations of the remaining unscattered waves. Due to\nthe inability of existing optical imaging methodologies to overcome both of\nthese problems simultaneously, imaging depth at the sub- micron spatial\nresolution has remained extremely shallow. Here we present an experimental\napproach for identifying and eliminating aberrations even in the presence of\nstrong multiple light scattering. For time-gated complex-field maps of\nreflected waves taken over various illumination channels, we identify two sets\nof aberration correction maps, one for the illumination path and one for the\nreflection path, that can preferentially accumulate the unscattered signal\nwaves over the multiple-scattered waves. By performing closed-loop optimization\nfor forward and phase- conjugation processes, we demonstrated a spatial\nresolution of 600 nm up to the unprecedented imaging depth of 7 scattering mean\nfree paths.\n", "  We report a magnetic field dependence of fluorescence of diamond single\ncrystals containing NV$^-$ centers. In such spectra, numerous sharp lines are\nfound, which correspond to Level Anti-Crossings (LACs) in coupled spins systems\ncomprising an NV$^-$ center. Theoretical modeling of such \"LAC-spectra\" enables\ncharacterization of paramagnetic defect centers and determination of their\nmagnetic resonance parameters, such as zero-field splitting and hyperfine\ncoupling constants. The outlined method thus enables sensitive detection of\nparamagnetic impurities in diamond crystals.\n", "  Although the notion of superdeterminism can, in principle, account for the\nviolation of the Bell inequalities, this potential explanation has been roundly\nrejected by the quantum foundations community. The arguments for rejection, one\nof the most substantive coming from Bell himself, are critically reviewed. In\nparticular, analysis of Bell's argument reveals an implicit unwarranted\nassumption: that the Euclidean metric is the appropriate yardstick for\nmeasuring distances in state space. Bell's argument is largely negated if this\nyardstick is instead based on the alternative $p$-adic metric. Such a metric,\ncommon in number theory, arises naturally when describing chaotic systems which\nevolve precisely on self-similar invariant sets in their state space. A\nlocally-causal realistic model of quantum entanglement is developed, based on\nthe premise that the laws of physics ultimately derive from an invariant-set\ngeometry in the state space of a deterministic quasi-cyclic mono-universe.\nBased on this, the notion of a complex Hilbert vector is reinterpreted in terms\nof an uncertain selection from a finite sample space of states, leading to a\nnovel form of `consistent histories' based on number-theoretic properties of\nthe transcendental cosine function. This leads to novel realistic\ninterpretations of position/momentum non-commutativity, EPR, the Bell Theorem\nand the Tsirelson bound. In this inherently holistic theory - neither\nconspiratorial, retrocausal, fine tuned nor nonlocal - superdeterminism is not\ninvoked by fiat but is emergent from these `consistent histories'\nnumber-theoretic constraints. Invariant set theory provides new perspectives on\nmany of the contemporary problems at the interface of quantum and gravitational\nphysics, and, if correct, may signal the end of particle physics beyond the\nStandard Model.\n", "  Textbooks frequently use the Helmholtz theorem to derive expressions for the\nelectrostatic and magnetostatic fields but they do not usually apply this\ntheorem to derive expressions for the time-dependent electric and magnetic\nfields, even when there is no formal objection to doing so because the proof of\nthe theorem does not involve time derivatives but only spatial derivatives.\nHere we address the question as to whether the Helmholtz theorem is useful to\nderive expressions for the fields of Maxwell's equations. We show that when\nthis theorem is applied to Maxwell's equations we obtain instantaneous\nexpressions of the electric and magnetic fields, which are formally correct but\nof little practical usefulness. We then discuss two generalizations of the\ntheorem which are shown to be useful to derive the retarded fields.\n", "  In this paper we study the device physics of a technique for realizing an\nn-p-n bipolar transistor action in the source side of a junctionless nanowire\ntunneling FET (BJN-TFET). In the on-state, tunneling of electrons from valence\nband of the source to conduction band of the channel enhances the hole\nconcentration as well as the potential in the source region which drives a\nbuilt-in BJT transistor by forward biasing the base-emitter junction, with the\nsource acting as a p-type region. Owing to the sharp switching of the JN-TFET\nand high BJT current gain, the overall performance is improved, including\nfavorable high on-state current (2.17*10-6 A/um), and sub 60 mV/dec\nsubthreshold swing (~ 50 mV/dec) at low supply voltages. This approach modifies\nthe current mechanism owning to the triggered BJT and makes the proposed\nstructure more attractive for scaling requirements in future low power\napplication.\n", "  Color printing at the diffraction limit has been recently explored by\nfabricating nanoscale plasmonic structures with electron beam lithography.\nHowever, only a limited color range and constant intensity throughout the\nstructure have been demonstrated. Here we show an alternative, facile approach\nrelying on the direct, open-atmosphere electrohydrodynamic rapid nanodrip\nprinting of controlled amounts of red, green and blue (RGB) quantum dots at a\nresolution of 250 nm. The narrow emission spectrum of the dots allows the\ncoverage of a very broad color space, exceeding standard RGB (sRGB) of modern\ndisplay devices. We print color gradients of variable intensity, which to date\ncould not be achieved with diffraction-limited resolution. Showcasing the\ncapabilities of the technology, we present a photo-realistic printed image of a\ncolorful parrot with a pixel size of 250 nm.\n", "  The study by Oberlack et al. (2006) consists of two main parts: a direct\nnumerical simulation (DNS) of a turbulent plane channel flow with streamwise\nrotation and a preceding Lie-group symmetry analysis on the two-point\ncorrelation equation (TPC) to analytically predict the scaling of the mean\nvelocity profiles for different rotation rates. We will only comment on the\nlatter part, since the DNS result obtained in the former part has already been\ncommented on by Recktenwald et al. (2009), stating that the observed mismatch\nbetween DNS and their performed experiment is possibly due to the prescription\nof periodic boundary conditions on a too small computational domain in the\nspanwise direction. By revisiting the group analysis part in Oberlack et al.\n(2006), we will generate more natural scaling laws describing better the mean\nvelocity profiles than the ones proposed. However, due to the statistical\nclosure problem of turbulence, this improvement is illusive. As we will\ndemonstrate, any arbitrary invariant scaling law for the mean velocity profiles\ncan be generated consistent to any higher order in the velocity correlations.\nThis problem of arbitrariness in invariant scaling persists even if we would\nformally consider the infinite statistical hierarchy of all multi-point\ncorrelation equations. The closure problem of turbulence simply cannot be\ncircumvented by just employing the method of Lie-group symmetry analysis alone:\nas the statistical equations are unclosed, so are their symmetries! Hence, an a\npriori prediction as how turbulence scales is thus not possible. Only a\nposteriori by anticipating what to expect from numerical or experimental data\nthe adequate invariant scaling law can be generated through an iterative\ntrial-and-error process. Finally, apart from this issue, also several\ninconsistencies and incorrect statements to be found in Oberlack et al. (2006)\nwill be pointed out.\n", "  A unitary t-design is a set of unitaries that is \"evenly distributed\" in the\nsense that the average of any t-th order polynomial over the design equals the\naverage over the entire unitary group. In various fields -- e.g. quantum\ninformation theory -- one frequently encounters constructions that rely on\nmatrices drawn uniformly at random from the unitary group. Often, it suffices\nto sample these matrices from a unitary t-design, for sufficiently high t. This\nresults in more explicit, derandomized constructions. The most prominent\nunitary t-design considered in quantum information is the multi-qubit Clifford\ngroup. It is known to be a unitary 3-design, but, unfortunately, not a\n4-design. Here, we give a simple, explicit characterization of the way in which\nthe Clifford group fails to constitute a 4-design. Our results show that for\nvarious applications in quantum information theory and in the theory of convex\nsignal recovery, Clifford orbits perform almost as well as those of true\n4-designs. Technically, it turns out that in a precise sense, the 4th tensor\npower of the Clifford group affords only one more invariant subspace than the\n4th tensor power of the unitary group. That additional subspace is a stabilizer\ncode -- a structure extensively studied in the field of quantum error\ncorrection codes. The action of the Clifford group on this stabilizer code can\nbe decomposed explicitly into previously known irreps of the discrete\nsymplectic group. We give various constructions of exact complex projective\n4-designs or approximate 4-designs of arbitrarily high precision from Clifford\norbits. Building on results from coding theory, we give strong evidence\nsuggesting that these orbits actually constitute complex projective 5-designs.\n", "  In this work, the dynamics of dephasing (without relaxation) in the presence\nof a chaotic oscillator is theoretically investigated. The time-dependent\ndensity functional theory (TDDFT) framework was employed in tandem with the\nLindblad master equation approach for modeling the dissipation dynamics. By\nemploying the Kohn-Sham (K-S) scheme under certain approximations, the exact\nmodel system for the potentials was acquired. In addition, a space-fractional\nK-S scheme is developed (using the modified Riemann-Liouville operator) for\nmodeling the dephasing phenomenon. Extensive analyses and comparative studies\nwere then done on the results obtained using the space-fractional K-S system\nand the conventional K-S system.\n", "  The Magellanic System (MS), consisting of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC),\nthe Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) and the Magellanic Bridge (MBR), contains\ndiverse sample of star clusters. Their spatial distribution, ages and chemical\nabundances may provide important information about the history of formation of\nthe whole System. We use deep photometric maps derived from the images\ncollected during the fourth phase of The Optical Gravitational Lensing\nExperiment (OGLE-IV) to construct the most complete catalog of star clusters in\nthe Large Magellanic Cloud using the homogeneous photometric data. In this\npaper we present the collection of star clusters found in the area of about 225\nsquare degrees in the outer regions of the LMC. Our sample contains 679\nvisually identified star cluster candidates, 226 of which were not listed in\nany of the previously published catalogs. The new clusters are mainly young\nsmall open clusters or clusters similar to associations.\n", "  Bead-rod-spring models are the foundation of the kinetic theory of polymer\nsolutions. We derive the diffusion equation for the probability density\nfunction of the configuration of a general bead-rod-spring model in\nshort-correlated Gaussian random flows. Under isotropic conditions, we solve\nthis equation analytically for the elastic rhombus model introduced by Curtiss,\nBird, and Hassager [Adv. Chem. Phys. 35 (1976), pp. 31-117].\n", "  This paper aimed at extending a model developed by Ladeveze to capture\nthermal expansion and coupled thermo-mechanical phenomena, as such as those\nencountered at elevated and extreme temperatures. In the new model a linear\nthermal expansion coefficient is added to equation of state to account for the\nthermal to mechanical coupling effects. The mechanical to thermal effects are\nintroduced by assuming an internal heat generation due to residual strain\neffects. The constitutive relations of the coupled thermo-mechanical behaviors\nof ceramic matrix composite material model were incorporated into Abaqus finite\nelement code as user defined material software. An extension of the methodology\npresented by Letombes to calibrate the ceramic matrix composite damage model\nparameters based on a woven silicon-carbide silicon-carbide material developed\nby Safran Group. Feasibility tests (tension-compression, tension-tension\ncyclic, simple tension tests) based on a dog bone and open hole specimen tests\ndemonstrated a good capturing of nonlinear as well as coupled\nthermos-mechanical behaviors in the silicon-carbide silicon-carbide material.\n", "  A mechanical model was developed to describe the behaviour of a device able\nto transform vibrations into rotations, named Vibrot. The theoretical model,\ndeveloped in the newtonian formulation of mechanics, was able to reproduce\nqualitatively all the experimental results existing in the literature, and\nquantitatively some of them.\n", "  We report on the operation of a double metal waveguide far-infrared quantum\ncascade laser emitting at 28 $\\mu$m, corresponding to the AlAs-like phonon\nReststrahlen band. To avoid absorption by AlAs-like optical phonons, the\nAl-free group-V alloy GaAs$_{0.51}$Sb$_{0.49}$ is used as a barrier layer in\nthe bound-to-continuum based active region. Lasing occurs at a wavelength of\n28.3 $\\mu$m, which is the longest wavelength among the quantum cascade lasers\noperating from mid-infrared to far-infrared. The threshold current density at\n50 K is 5.5 kA/cm$^{2}$ and maximum operation temperature is 175 K. We also\ndiscuss the feasibility that operation wavelength cover the whole spectral\nrange bridging between mid-infrared and terahertz by choosing suited group\nIII-V materials.\n", "  Coupling between a magnetic impurity and an external bath can give rise to\nmany-body quantum phenomena, including Kondo and Hund's impurity states in\nmetals, and Yu-Shiba-Rusinov states in superconductors. While advances have\nbeen made in probing the magnetic properties of d-shell impurities on surfaces,\nthe confinement of f orbitals makes them difficult to access directly. Here we\nshow that a 4f driven Kondo resonance can be modulated spatially by asymmetric\ncoupling between a metallic surface and a molecule containing a 4f-like moment.\nStrong hybridisation of dysprosium double-decker phthalocyanine with Cu(001)\ninduces Kondo screening of the central magnetic moment. Misalignment between\nthe symmetry axes of the molecule and the surface induces asymmetry in the\nmolecule's electronic structure, spatially mediating electronic access to the\nmagnetic moment through the Kondo resonance. This work demonstrates the\nimportant role that molecular ligands play in mediating electronic and magnetic\ncoupling and in accessing many-body quantum states.\n", "  Objective: Proximal and whole-body vibrations are well studied in\nseismocardiography and ballistocardiography, yet distal vibrations are still\npoorly understood. In this paper we develop two methods to measure aortic valve\nopening (AVO) and closing (AVC) from distal vibrations. Methods: AVO and AVC\nwere detected for each heartbeat with accelerometers on the upper arm (A),\nwrist (W), and knee (K) of 22 consenting adults following isometric exercise.\nExercise-induced changes were recorded with impedance cardiography, and\nnine-beat ensemble averaging was applied. Our first method, FilterBCG, detects\npeaks in distal vibrations after filtering with individually-tuned bandpass\nfilters while RidgeBCG uses ridge regression to estimate AVO and AVC without\npeaks. Pseudocode is provided. Results: In agreement with recent studies, we\ndid not find peaks at AVO and AVC in distal vibrations, and the conventional\nR-J interval method from the literature also correlated poorly with AVO (r2 =\n0.22 A, 0.14 W, 0.12 K). Interestingly, distal vibrations filtered with\nFilterBCG resembled seismocardiogram signals and yielded reliable peaks at AVO\n(r2 = 0.95 A, 0.94 W, 0.77 K) and AVC (r2 = 0.92 A, 0.89 W, 0.68 K).\nConclusion: FilterBCG measures AVO and AVC accurately from arm, wrist, and knee\nvibrations, and it outperforms R-J intervals and RidgeBCG. Significance: To our\nknowledge, this study is the first to measure AVC accurately from distal\nvibrations. Finally, AVO timing is needed to assess cardiovascular disease risk\nwith pulse wave velocity (PWV) and for cuff-less diastolic blood pressure\nmeasurement via aortic pulse-transit time (PTT).\n", "  The concatenated Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (C-GHZ) state is a new type of\nmultipartite entangled state, which has potential application in future quantum\ninformation. In this paper, we propose a protocol of constructing arbitrary\nC-GHZ entangled state approximatively. Different from the previous protocols,\neach logic is encoded in the coherent state. This protocol is based on the\nlinear optics, which is feasible in experimental technology. This protocol may\nbe useful in quantum information based on the C-GHZ state.\n", "  Einstein-dilaton-$U(2)$ gauge field theory is considered in a spacetime\ncharacterised by $\\alpha$ and $z$, which are the hyperscaling violation factor\nand the dynamical critical exponent respectively. We obtain the critical values\nof chemical potential $\\mu_c$ that is defined on its boundary dual fluid and\nderives phase transition from spatially isotropic to anisotropic phase for the\nvarious values of the $\\alpha$ and $z$. To do so, we first apply\nSturm-Liouville theory and estimate the upper bounds of the critical values of\nthe chemical potential. We also employ a numerical method in the ranges of $1\n\\leq z \\leq 4$ and $0 \\leq \\alpha \\leq 4$ to check if the Sturm-Liouville\nmethod correctly estimates the critical values of the chemical po10 percent\nerror ranges. Finally, we compute free energy density of the dual fluid by\nusing its gravity dual and check if the system shows phase transition at the\ncritical values of the chemical potential $\\mu_c$ for the given parameter\nregion of $\\alpha$ and $z$. Interestingly, it is observed that the anisotropic\nphase is more favoured than the isotropic phase for small values of $z$ and\n$\\alpha$. However, for large values of $z$ and $\\alpha$, the anisotropic phase\nis not favoured.tential. It turns out that the two methods are agreed within\n", "  The computer-aided folding of biomolecules, particularly RNAs, is one of the\nmost difficult challenges in computational structural biology. RNA tetraloops\nare fundamental RNA motifs playing key roles in RNA folding and RNA-RNA and\nRNA-protein interactions. Although state-of-the-art Molecular Dynamics (MD)\nforce fields correctly describe the native state of these tetraloops as a\nstable free-energy basin on the microsecond time scale, enhanced sampling\ntechniques reveal that the native state is not the global free energy minimum,\nsuggesting yet unidentified significant imbalances in the force fields. Here,\nwe tested our ability to fold the RNA tetraloops in various force fields and\nsimulation settings. We employed three different enhanced sampling techniques,\nnamely, temperature replica exchange MD (T-REMD), replica exchange with solute\ntempering (REST2), and well-tempered metadynamics (WT-MetaD). We aimed to\nseparate problems caused by limited sampling from those due to force-field\ninaccuracies. We found that none of the contemporary force fields is able to\ncorrectly describe folding of the 5'-GAGA-3' tetraloop over a range of\nsimulation conditions. We thus aimed to identify which terms of the force field\nare responsible for this poor description of TL folding. We showed that at\nleast two different imbalances contribute to this behavior, namely,\noverstabilization of base-phosphate and/or sugar-phosphate interactions and\nunderestimated stability of the hydrogen bonding interaction in base pairing.\nThe first artifact stabilizes the unfolded ensemble, while the second one\ndestabilizes the folded state. The former problem might be partially alleviated\nby reparametrization of the van der Waals parameters of the phosphate oxygens\nsuggested by Case et al., while in order to overcome the latter effect we\nsuggest local potentials to better capture hydrogen bonding interactions.\n", "  We present the first measurement of the Michel parameters $\\bar{\\eta}$ and\n$\\xi\\kappa$ in the radiative leptonic decay of the $\\tau$ lepton using 703\nf$\\mathrm{b}^{-1}$ of data collected with the Belle detector at the KEKB\n$e^+e^-$ collider. The Michel parameters are measured by an unbinned maximum\nlikelihood fit to the kinematic information of\n$e^+e^-\\rightarrow\\tau^+\\tau^-\\rightarrow (\\pi^+\\pi^0\n\\bar{\\nu})(l^-\\nu\\bar{\\nu}\\gamma)$ $(l=e$ or $\\mu)$. The preliminary values of\nthe measured Michel parameters are $\\bar{\\eta} = -2.0 \\pm 1.5 \\pm 0.8$ and\n$\\xi\\kappa = 0.6 \\pm 0.4 \\pm 0.2$, where the first error is statistical and the\nsecond is systematic.\n", "  Numerous studies have attempted to model the effect of mass media on the\ntransmission of diseases such as influenza, however quantitative data on media\nengagement has until recently been difficult to obtain. With the recent\nexplosion of \"big data\" coming from online social media and the like, large\nvolumes of data on a population's engagement with mass media during an epidemic\nare becoming available to researchers. In this study we combine an online data\nset comprising millions of shared messages relating to influenza with\ntraditional surveillance data on flu activity to suggest a functional form for\nthe relationship between the two. Using this data we present a simple\ndeterministic model for influenza dynamics incorporating media effects, and\nshow that such a model helps explain the dynamics of historical influenza\noutbreaks. Furthermore, through model selection we show that the proposed media\nfunction fits historical data better than other media functions proposed in\nearlier studies.\n", "  Is cancer a disease that can be cured or a degenerative disease which comes\npredominantly with old age? We give an answer based on a two-dimensional\nrepresentation of diseases. These two dimensions are defined as follows. In\nmortality curves there is an age, namely a_c = 10 years, which plays a crucial\nrole in the sense that the mortality rate decreases in the interval I1=(a<a_c)\nand increases in the interval I2=(a>a_c). The respective trends in I1 and I2\nare the two parameters used in our classification of diseases. Within the\nframework of reliability analysis, I1 and I2 would be referred to as the\n\"burn-in\" and \"wear-out\" phases. This leads to define three broad groups of\ndiseases. (AS1) Asymmetry with prevalence of I1. (AS2) Asymmetry with\nprevalence of I2. (S) Symmetry, with I1 and I2 both playing roles of comparable\nimportance. Not surprisingly, among AS1-cases one finds all diseases due to\ncongenital malformations. In the AS2-class one finds degenerative diseases,\ne.g. Alzheimer's disease. Among S-cases one finds most diseases due to external\npathogens or to wear-out processes. Cancer is one of those mixed cases and it\nis closer to (AS2) than to (AS1). This representation also explains what we\ncall an OVERKILL EFFECT in old age. It tells us that even an effective cancer\ntherapy would have no influence whatsoever on the extent of human life unless\nALL other diseases are cured simultaneously. We conclude that whilst one might\ndevelop a cure for many of the known diseases of old age, new diseases will\narise and the quest for the ultimate cure will be never ending. Death before\nthe age of 120 seems firmly written in our genetic code and the best we shall\nbe able to do is to help people cope with the inevitability of death as and\nwhen it arises.\n", "  Precise control of atom-light interactions is vital to many quantum\ninformation protocols. In particular, atomic systems can be used to slow and\nstore light to form a quantum memory. Optical storage can be achieved via\nstopped light, where no optical energy remains in the atoms, or as stationary\nlight, where some optical energy remains resent during storage. In this work,\nwe demonstrate a form of self-stabilising stationary light. From any initial\nstate, our atom-light system evolves to a stable configuration that is devoid\nof coherent emission from the atoms, yet may contain bright optical excitation.\nThis phenomenon is verified experimentally in a cloud of cold Rb87 atoms. The\nspinwave in our atomic cloud is imaged from the side allowing direct comparison\nwith theoretical predictions.\n", "  The spectral shift function of a pair of self-adjoint operators is expressed\nvia an abstract operator valued Titchmarsh--Weyl $m$-function. This general\nresult is applied to different self-adjoint realizations of second-order\nelliptic partial differential operators on smooth domains with compact\nboundaries, Schr\\\"{o}dinger operators with compactly supported potentials, and\nfinally, Schr\\\"{o}dinger operators with singular potentials supported on\nhypersurfaces. In these applications the spectral shift function is determined\nin an explicit form with the help of (energy parameter dependent)\nDirichlet-to-Neumann maps.\n", "  In this article, we give a definition of apparent horizon in a two\ndimensional general dilaton gravity theory. With this definition, we construct\nthe mechanics of the apparent horizon by introducing a quasi-local energy of\nthe theory. Our discussion generalizes the apparent horizons mechanics in\ngeneral spherically symmetric spactimes in four or higher dimensions to the two\ndimensional dilaton gravity case.\n", "  The adjoint equation was introduced in the early days of neutron transport\nand its solution, the neutron importance, has ben used for several applications\nin neutronics. The work presents at first a critical review of the adjoint\nneutron transport equation. Afterwards, the adjont model is constructed for a\nreference physical situation, for which an analytical approach is viable, i.e.\nan infinite homogeneous scattering medium. This problem leads to an equation\nthat is the adjoint of the slowing-down equation that is well-known in nuclear\nreactor physics. A general closed-form analytical solution to such adjoint\nequation is obtained by a procedure that can be used also to derive the\nclassical Placzek functions. This solution constitutes a benchmark for any\nstatistical or numerical approach to the adjoint equation. A sampling technique\nto evaluate the adjoint flux for the transport equation is then proposed and\nphysically interpreted as a transport model for pseudo-particles. This can be\ndone by introducing appropriate kernels describing the transfer of the\npseudo-particles in phase space. This technique allows estimating the\nimportance function by a standard Monte Carlo approach. The sampling scheme is\nvalidated by comparison with the analytical results previously obtained.\n", "  A non-perturbative theory of the spontaneous down conversion (SDC) of surface\nplasmon polaritons at a metal-dielectric interface is presented. It is shown\nthat the process is resonantly enhanced for the characteristic power of\nexcitation, typically of the order of tens of watts. At a stronger excitation\nthe yield of SDC decreases rapidly. At a stronger excitation the yield of SDC\ndecreases rapidly. The reason for this decrease is the high rate of the change\nof surface plasmon polaritons by the laser field, exceeding the rate of the\nzero-point fluctuations responsible for the SDC process. The obtained results\nmay help one to construct miniature sources of entangled photons for quantum\ncommunication.\n", "  In this paper, secondary ferrite cores and resonant structures have been used\nfor field enhancement. The tissue was placed between the double square source\ncoil and the secondary ferrite core. Resonant coils were added which aided in\nmodulating the electric field in the tissue. The field distribution in the\ntissue was measured using electromagnetic simulations and ex-vivo measurements\nwith tissue. Calculations involve the use of finite element analysis (Ansoft\nHFSS) to represent the electrical properties of the physical structure. The\nsetup was compared to a conventional design in which the secondary ferrite\ncores were absent. It was found that the induced electric field could be\nincreased by 122%, when ferrite cores were placed below the tissue at 450 kHz\nsource frequency. The induced electric field was found to be localized in the\ntissue, verified using ex-vivo experiments. This preliminary study maybe\nfurther extended to establish the verified proposed concept with different\ncomplicated body parts modelled using the software and in-vivo experiments as\nrequired to obtain the desired induced field.\n", "  The space-charge-limited current in a zero thickness planar thin film depends\non the geometry of the electrodes. We present a theory which is to a large\nextent analytical and applicable to many different lay-outs. We show that a\nspace-charge-limited current can only be sustained if the emitting electrode\ninduces a singularity in the field and if the singularity induced by the\ncollecting electrode is not too strong. For those lay-outs where no\nspace-charge-limited current can be sustained for a zero thickness film, the\nreal thickness of the film must be taken into account using a numerical model.\n", "  Energy levels, radiative rates (A-values) and lifetimes, calculated with the\nGRASP code, are reported for an astrophysically important O-like ion Mg~V.\nResults are presented for transitions among the lowest 86 levels belonging to\nthe 2s$^2$2p$^4$, 2s2p$^5$, 2p$^6$, and 2s$^2$2p$^3$3$\\ell$ configurations.\nThere is satisfactory agreement with earlier data for most levels/transitions,\nbut scope remains for improvement. Collision strengths are also calculated,\nwith the DARC code, and the results obtained are comparable for most\ntransitions (at energies above thresholds) with earlier work using the DW code.\nIn thresholds region, resonances have been resolved in a fine energy mesh to\ndetermine values of effective collision strengths ($\\Upsilon$) as accurately as\npossible. Results are reported for all transitions at temperatures up to\n10$^6$~K, which should be sufficient for most astrophysical applications.\nHowever, a comparison with earlier data reveals discrepancies of up to two\norders of magnitude for over 60\\% of transitions, at all temperatures. The\nreasons for these discrepancies are discussed in detail.\n", "  A powerful technique is introduced for simulating mechanical and\nelectromechanical properties of one-dimensional nanostructures under arbitrary\ncombinations of bending, twisting, and stretching. The technique is based on a\nnovel control of periodic symmetry, which eliminates artifacts due to\ndeformation constraints and quantum finite-size effects, and allows transparent\nelectronic structure analysis. Via density-functional tight-binding\nimplementation, the technique demonstrates its utility by predicting novel\nelectromechanical properties in carbon nanotubes and abrupt behavior in the\nstructural yielding of Au7 and MoS nanowires. The technique drives simulations\nmarkedly closer to the realistic modeling of these slender nanostructures under\nexperimental conditions.\n", "  Long-lived particles are contained in a variety of beyond Standard Model\ntheories, including supersymmetric models, universal extra dimensions, or\ntechnicolor theories. If the lifetime of such a particle is long enough, the\nparticle can enter - or even pass through - the detector before it decays.\nTherefore, searches for long-lived particles require a very different search\nstrategy compared to conventional searches for particles beyond the Standard\nModel. If the new particle is not only weakly interacting, the particle can be\nreconstructed itself and not only via its decay products. A very specific\ncharacteristic of such new heavy charged particles is their large ionization\nlosses when traveling through the detector. This article summarizes searches\nfor long-lived particles at the CMS and ATLAS experiments that exploit the\npotentially high ionization losses per path length (dE/dx) of the new particle.\nThe presented searches are performed on 8 and/or 13 TeV data. Additionally, an\noverview of the methodology of dE/dx measurements at the CMS and ATLAS\nexperiments is given.\n", "  We outline a realistic energy transition roadmap for Italy, in which the\nwhole energy demand is met by electricity generated by low cost renewable\nenergy technologies, namely solar photovoltaic, wind and hydroelectric power.\nWe assess the amount of extra power and storage capacity to be installed along\nwith costs, return on investment and payback time. Based on cost, renewable\nnature and scalability, storage in energy dense polysaccharides enzymatically\nsynthesized from carbon dioxide, water and surplus electricity is proposed to\nmeet the significant storage requirements.\n", "  The society has a multi-layered structure, where the layers represent the\ndifferent contexts. To model this structure we begin with a single-layer\nweighted social network (WSN) model showing the Granovetterian structure. We\nfind that when merging such WSN models, a sufficient amount of inter-layer\ncorrelation is needed to maintain the relationship between topology and link\nweights, while these correlations destroy the enhancement in the community\noverlap due to multiple layers. To resolve this, we devise a geographic\nmulti-layer WSN model, where the indirect inter-layer correlations due to the\ngeographic constraints of individuals enhance the overlaps between the\ncommunities and, at the same time, the Granovetterian structure is preserved.\nFurthermore, the network of social interactions can be considered as a\nmultiplex from another point of view too: each layer corresponds to one\ncommunication channel and the aggregate of all them constitutes the entire\nsocial network. However, usually one has information only about one of the\nchannels, which should be considered as a sample of the whole. Here we show by\nsimulations and analytical methods that this sampling may lead to bias. For\nexample, while it is expected that the degree distribution of the whole social\nnetwork has a maximum at a value larger than one, we get with reasonable\nassumptions about the sampling process a monotonously decreasing distribution\nas observed in empirical studies of single channel data. We analyse the\nfar-reaching consequences of our findings.\n", "  For the 1-D harmonic oscillator with position depending variable mass, a\nHamiltonian and constant of motion are given through a consistent approach.\nThen, the quantization of this system is carried out using the operator $\\hat\np$, for the Hamiltonian, and the operator $\\hat v$ for the constant of motion.\nWe find that the result of both quantizations brings about different quantum\ndynamics.\n", "  Understanding quantitatively the heating dynamics in magnetic tunnel\njunctions (MTJ) submitted to current pulses is very important in the context of\nspin-transfer-torque magnetic random access memory development. Here we provide\na method to probe the heating of MTJ using the RKKY coupling of a synthetic\nferrimagnetic storage layer as a thermal sensor. The temperature increase\nversus applied bias voltage is measured thanks to the decrease of the spin-flop\nfield with temperature. This method allows distinguishing spin transfer torque\n(STT) effects from the influence of temperature on the switching field. The\nheating dynamics is then studied in real-time by probing the conductance\nvariation due to spin-flop rotation during heating. This approach provides a\nnew method for measuring fast heating in spintronic devices, particularly\nmagnetic random access memory (MRAM) using thermally assisted or spin transfer\ntorque writing.\n", "  Deliverable 1.1 is a report on imaging of individual skyrmions of MML systems\nmade by different techniques. This deliverable falls within work package 1\n(WP1:Static equilibrium properties of interface induced skyrmions in magnetic\nfilms and multilayers) of the MAGicSky research proposal whose objectives are:\nthe growth of magnetic multilayer systems with large interfacial chiral\ninteraction, the determination of the amplitude of the Dzyaloshinskii--Moriya\ninteractions (DMi), the detailed structural and magnetic characterization of\ninterfaces, the magnetic imaging of individual skyrmions and the thermal\nstability and interaction of skyrmions with intrinsic and/or artificial\ndefects. It should be emphasized that imaging magnetic skyrmionic structures\nforms the basis for all the planned subsequent material optimization,\nelectrical transport experiments and devices preparation in the MAGicSky\nresearch program. In particular, imaging is paramount as a technique since it\nenables us to unequivocally demonstrate chiral magnetic skyrmions by directly\nimaging i) the effects of engineering multilayer samples with large DMis and\nii) the skyrmionic structure and properties. In order to get complementary\nphysical insight on the properties of magnetic skyrmions and to corroborate our\nresearch results, we utilise a plethora of key state-of-the-art advanced\nmagnetic imaging techniques, namely: i) Spin-polarised Scanning Tunnelling\nMicroscopy (SP-STM), Scanning Transmission X-ray Microscopy (STXM) Lorentz\nTransmission Electron Microscopy (Lorentz TEM) as well as, Magnetic Force\nMicroscopy (MFM). These imaging experiments can therefore stand as the base for\nall the other objectives in WP1 as well as WP2 that will study Dynamic\nproperties: nucleation, propagation and detection of skyrmions. Imaging has\nbeen aimed to test and get feedback from the theoretical and numerical\ninvestigations of skyrmion systems of WP3. Finally, for WP4: Towards skyrmion\nbased devices for information storage and processing, some of the techniques\ndetailed here in D1.1 will enable us to image and test the first devices and\ntheir functionality. In short, the MAGicSky consortium research results in D1.1\nconstitute a major milestone that acts as a stepping-stone to every other\nexperimental effort and we have achieved it. The results relevant to the D1.1\ndeliverable were presented in 5 publications and several invited talks at\ninternational workshop and conferences:\n", "  Matter/antimatter (MAM) pair production from the vacuum through intense\nelectric fields has been investigated theoretically for nearly a century. This\nhistory is reviewed and proposals of MAM for intra-solar system and\ninterstellar propulsion systems are examined. The quantum mechanical foundation\nof MAM production was developed by MAM production occurs when the electric\nfield strength is above the critical value at which the fields become\nnon-linear with self-interactions (known as the Schwinger limit).MAM production\noccurs when the electric field strength is above the critical value at which\nthe fields become non-linear with self-interactions (known as the Schwinger\nlimit). As the energy density of lasers approach the critical strength of 10^16\nV/cm, the feasibility and functionality of electron-positron pair production\nhas received growing interest. Current laser intensities are approaching within\n1 order of magnitude of the Schwinger limit. Processes for lowering the\ncritical energy density below the Schwinger limit through additional quantum\nmechanical effects have been explored. One under study at the U. of Connecticut\nand the U. of Duisburg-Essen is pulsation of inhomogeneous electric fields\nwithin a carrier wave. Another is via enhancement of quantum effects by\naddition of a magnetic field parallel to the electric field. Magnetic field\nenhancement to quark/anti-quark production through chiral symmetry breaking\neffects in QCD was considered by J. Preskill in the 1980's. S. Pyo and D. Page\nshowed in 2007 that parallel magnetic fields enhance electron/positron\nproduction via an analogous QED effect. MAM production as a highly efficient\nfuel source for intra solar system and interstellar propulsion was proposed by\nD. Crow in 1983. The viability of this method of propulsion will be studied,\nespecially from the parallel electric and magnetic field approach.\n", "  A physical picture for Quantum Mechanics which permits to conciliate it with\nthe usual common sense is proposed. The picture agrees with the canonical\nCopenhagen interpretation making more clear its statements.\n", "  We study time-dependent heat transport in systems composed of a resonant\nlevel periodically forced with an external power source and coupled to a\nfermionic continuum. This simple model contains the basic ingredients to\nunderstand time resolved energy exchange in quantum capacitors that behave as\nsingle particle emitters. We analyse the behaviour of the dynamic heat current\nfor driving frequencies within the non-adiabatic regime, showing that it does\nnot obey a Joule dissipation law.\n", "  Run 1 at the LHC was very successful with the discovery of a new boson. The\nboson's properties are found to be compatible with those of the Standard Model\nHiggs boson. It is now revealing the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking\nand (possibly) the discovery of physics beyond the Standard Model that are the\nprimary goals of the just restarted LHC. The ultimate precision will be reached\nat the High-Luminosity LHC phase with a proton-proton centre-of-mass energy of\n14 TeV. In this contribution physics prospects are presented for ATLAS for the\nintegrated luminosities 300/fb and 3000/fb: the ultimate precision attainable\non measurements of the Higgs boson couplings to elementary fermions and bosons,\nits trilinear self-coupling, as well as perspectives on the searches for\nsupersymmetric partners associated with the Higgs boson. Benchmark studies are\npresented to show how the sensitivity improves at the future LHC runs. For all\nthese studies, a parametrised simulation of the upgraded ATLAS detector is used\nand expected pileup conditions are accounted for.\n", "  A problem of lighting objects and surfaces with artificial sources of\nnoncoherent microwave radiation with the aim to observe them using radiometric\nequipment is considered. Transmitters based on dynamic chaos generators are\nused as sources of noncoherent wideband microwave radiation. An experimental\nsample of such a device, i.e., a radio lighting lamp based on a chaos\nmicrogenerator and its performance are presented.\n", "  The anomalous magnetic moment of the muon currently exhibits a discrepancy of\nabout three standard deviations between the experimental value and recent\nStandard Model predictions. The theoretical uncertainty is dominated by the\nhadronic vacuum polarization and the hadronic light-by-light (HLbL) scattering\ncontributions, where the latter has so far only been fully evaluated using\ndifferent models. To pave the way for a lattice calculation of HLbL, we present\nan expression for the HLbL contribution to $g-2$ that involves a\nmultidimensional integral over a position-space QED kernel function in the\ncontinuum and a lattice QCD four-point correlator. We describe our\nsemi-analytic calculation of the kernel and test the approach by evaluating the\n$\\pi^0$-pole contribution in the continuum.\n", "  Device-independent quantum cryptography allows security even if the devices\nused to execute the protocol are untrusted - whether this is due to unknown\nimperfections in the implementation, or because the adversary himself\nconstructed them to subvert the security of the protocol. While\ndevice-independence has seen much attention in the domain of quantum key\ndistribution, relatively little is known for general protocols. Here we\nintroduce a new model for device-independence for two-party protocols and\nposition verification in the noisy-storage model. For the first time, we show\nthat such protocols are secure in the most general device-independent model in\nwhich the devices may have arbitrary memory, states and measurements. In our\nanalysis, we make use of a slight modification of a beautiful new tool\ndeveloped in [arXiv:1607.01796] called \"Entropy Accumulation Theorem\". What's\nmore, the protocols we analyze use only simple preparations and measurements,\nand can be realized using any experimental setup able to perform a CHSH Bell\ntest. Specifically, security can be attained for any violation of the CHSH\ninequality, where a higher violation merely leads to a reduction in the amount\nof rounds required to execute the protocol.\n", "  The paper deals with the investigation of the Mars subsurface by means of\ndata collected by the Mars Advanced Radar for Subsurface and Ionosphere\nSounding working at few MHz frequencies. A data processing strategy, which\ncombines a simple inversion model and an accurate procedure for data selection\nis presented. This strategy permits to mitigate the theoretical and practical\ndifficulties of the inverse problem arising because of the inaccurate knowledge\nof the parameters regarding both the scenario under investigation and the\nradiated electromagnetic field impinging on the Mars surface. The results\npresented in this paper show that, it is possible to reliably retrieve the\nelectromagnetic properties of deeper structures, if such strategy is accurately\napplied. An example is given here, where the analysis of the data collected on\nGemina Lingula, a region of the North Polar layer deposits, allowed us to\nretrieve permittivity values for the basal unit in agreement with those usually\nassociated to the Earth basaltic rocks.\n", "  We propose a framework, where the hierarchy between the unification and the\nFermi scale emerges radiatively. This work tackles the long-standing question\nabout the connection between the low Fermi scale and a more fundamental scale\nof Nature. As a concrete example, we study a Pati-Salam-type unification of\nElementary-Goldstone-Higgs scenario, where the Standard Model scalar sector is\nreplaced by an SU(4)-symmetric one, and the observed Higgs particle is an\nelementary pseudo-Goldstone boson. We construct a concrete model where the\nunification scale is fixed to a phenomenologically viable value, while the\nFermi scale is generated radiatively. This scenario provides an interesting\nlink between the unification and Fermi scale physics, and opens up prospects\nfor exploring a wide variety of open problems in particle physics, ranging from\nneutrinos to cosmic inflation.\n", "  According to the computations results obtained by Bisikalo et al. (2013b) for\nthe gas-dynamical effect of stellar winds on exoplanet atmospheres, three types\nof gaseous envelopes can form around hot Jupiters: closed, quasi-closed, and\nopen. The type of envelope that forms depends on the position of the frontal\ncollision point (where the dynamical pressure of the wind is equal to the\npressure of the surrounding atmosphere) relative to the Roche-lobe boundaries.\nClosed envelopes are formed around planets whose atmospheres lie completely\nwithin their Roche lobes. If the frontal collision point is located outside the\nRoche lobe, the atmospheric material begins to flow out through the Lagrangian\npoints $\\mathrm{L_1}$ and $\\mathrm{L_2}$, which can result in the formation of\nquasi-closed (if the dynamical pressure of the stellar wind stops the outflow\nthrough $\\mathrm{L_1}$) or open gaseous envelopes. The example of the typical\nhot Jupiter HD 209458 b is considered for four sets of atmospheric parameters,\nto determine the mass-loss rates for the different types of envelopes arising\nwith these parameters. The mass-loss rates based on the modeling results were\nestimated to be $\\dot{M} \\leq 10^{9}$ g/s for a closed atmosphere, $\\dot{M}\n\\simeq 3 \\times 10^{9}$ g/s for a quasi-closed atmosphere, and $\\dot{M} \\simeq\n3 \\times 10^{10}$ g/s for an open atmosphere. The matter in the closed and\nquasi-closed atmospheres flows out mainly through $\\mathrm{L_2}$, and the\nmatter in open envelopes primarily through $\\mathrm{L_1}$.\n", "  In order to reduce the potential radiation risk, low-dose CT has attracted\nmore and more attention. However, simply lowering the radiation dose will\nsignificantly degrade the imaging quality. In this paper, we propose a noise\nreduction method for low-dose CT via deep learning without accessing the\noriginal projection data. An architecture of deep convolutional neural network\nwas considered to map the low-dose CT images into its corresponding normal-dose\nCT images patch by patch. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate\na state-the-art performance of the proposed method.\n", "  We report the discovery of a new cataclysmic variable DDE 32 identified with\nthe ROSAT X-ray source 1RXS J161935.7+524630 in Draco. The variability was\noriginally found by D. Denisenko on the digitized Palomar plates centered at\nthe position of X-ray source. The photometric observations by F. Martinelli at\nLajatico Astronomical Center in June 2015 have shown the large amplitude\n(nearly 2 magnitudes) variability with a period about 100.5 minutes. Using the\npublicly available Catalina Sky Survey data from 2005 to 2013 we have improved\nthe value of period to 0.0697944 days. Comparison of the archival CRTS data\nwith more recent observations from Lajatico shows the dramatic changes in the\nlight curve shape. Instead of a single peak present in Catalina data before\n2014, there were two peaks of nearly the same height during 2015. SDSS spectrum\ntaken in June 2009 shows prominent Helium emission lines between the bright\nBalmer series. He II 4686 AA line has more than 30% effective width compared to\nH_beta line. All those features allow us to interpret 1RXS J161935.7+524630 as\na magnetic cataclysmic variable (polar) with the accretion mode changing from\none pole before 2014 to two poles in 2015.\n", "  The roles of Lie groups in Feynman's path integrals in non-relativistic\nquantum mechanics are discussed. Dynamical as well as geometrical symmetries\nare found useful for path integral quantization. Two examples having the\nsymmetry of a non-compact Lie group are considered. The first is the free\nquantum motion of a particle on a space of constant negative curvature. The\nsystem has a group SO(d,1) associated with the geometrical structure, to which\nthe technique of harmonic analysis on a homogeneous space is applied. As an\nexample of a system having a non-compact dynamical symmetry, the d-dimensional\nharmonic oscillator is chosen, which has the non-compact dynamical group\nSU(1,1) besides its geometrical symmetry SO(d). The radial path integral is\nseen as a convolution of the matrix functions of a compact group element of\nSU(1,1) on the continuous basis.\n", "  Motion, e.g., due to patient movement or improper device calibration, is\ninevitable in many imaging modalities such as photoacoustic tomography (PAT) by\na rotating system and can lead to undesirable motion artifacts in image\nreconstructions, if ignored. In this paper, we establish a hybrid-type model\nfor PAT that incorporates motion in the model. We first introduce an\napproximate continuous model and establish two uniqueness results for simple\nparameterized motion models. Then we formulate the discrete problem of\nsimultaneous motion estimation and image reconstruction as a separable\nnonlinear least squares problem and describe an automatic approach to detect\nand eliminate motion artifacts during the reconstruction process. Numerical\nexamples validate our methods.\n", "  We present and evaluate a detailed multi-species two-phase thermodynamic\nequilibrium model for large-eddy simulations (LES) of liquid-fuel injection and\nmixing at high pressure. The model can represent the coexistence of\nsupercritical states and multi-component subcritical two-phase states. LES\nresults for the transcritical Spray A of the Engine Combustion Network (ECN)\nare found to agree very well to available experimental data. We also address\nwell-known numerical challenges of trans- and supercritical fluid mixing and\ncompare a fully conservative formulation to a quasi conservative formulation of\nthe governing equations. Our results prove physical and numerical consistency\nof both methods on fine grids and demonstrate the effects of energy\nconservation errors associated with the quasi conservative formulation on\ntypical LES grids.\n", "  In this paper we carry out a preliminary study of the dependence of the\nTully-Fisher Relation (TFR) with the width and intensity level of the absolute\nmagnitude interval of a limited sample of 2411 galaxies taken from Mathewson \\&\nFord (1996). The galaxies in this sample do not differ significantly in\nmorphological type, and are distributed over an $\\sim11$-magnitude interval\n($-24.4 < I < -13.0$). We take as directives the papers by Nigoche-Netro et al.\n(2008, 2009, 2010) in which they study the dependence of the Kormendy (KR), the\nFundamental Plane (FPR) and the Faber-Jackson Relations (FJR) with the\nmagnitude interval within which the observed galaxies used to derive these\nrelations are contained. We were able to characterise the behaviour of the TFR\ncoefficients $(\\alpha, \\beta)$ with respect to the width of the magnitude\ninterval as well as with the brightness of the galaxies within this magnitude\ninterval. We concluded that the TFR for this specific sample of galaxies\ndepends on observational biases caused by arbitrary magnitude cuts, which in\nturn depend on the width and intensity of the chosen brightness levels.\n", "  We consider the magnetic properties of the hollow cylindrical ideal remanence\nmagnet. This magnet is the cylindrical permanent magnet that generates a\nuniform field in the cylinder bore, using the least amount of magnetic energy\nto do so. The remanence distribution of this magnet is derived and the\ngenerated field is compared to that of a Halbach cylinder of equal dimensions.\nThe ideal remanence magnet is shown in most cases to generate a significantly\nlower field than the equivalent Halbach cylinder, although the field is\ngenerated with higher efficiency. The most efficient Halbach cylinder is shown\nto generate a field exactly twice as large as the equivalent ideal remanence\nmagnet.\n", "  The susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) agent-based model is usually\nemployed in the investigation of epidemics. The model describes a Markov\nprocess for a single communicable disease among susceptible (S) and infected\n(I) agents. However, the disease spreading forecasting is often restricted to\nnumerical simulations, while analytic formulations lack both general results\nand perturbative approaches since they are subjected to asymmetric time\ngenerators. Here, we discuss perturbation theory, approximations and\napplication of many-body techniques in epidemic models in the framework for\nsquared norm of probability vector $|P(t)| ^2$, in which asymmetric time\ngenerators are replaced by their symmetric counterparts.\n", "  The Gamma-Ray Imager/Polarimeter for Solar flares (GRIPS) is a balloon-borne\ntelescope designed to study solar-flare particle acceleration and transport. We\ndescribe GRIPS's first Antarctic long-duration flight in Jan 2016 and report\npreliminary calibration and science results.\n  Electron and ion dynamics, particle abundances and the ambient plasma\nconditions in solar flares can be understood by examining hard X-ray (HXR) and\ngamma-ray emission (20 keV to 10 MeV) with enhanced imaging, spectroscopy and\npolarimetry. GRIPS is specifically designed to answer questions including: What\ncauses the spatial separation between energetic electrons producing HXRs and\nenergetic ions producing gamma-ray lines? How anisotropic are the relativistic\nelectrons, and why can they dominate in the corona? How do the compositions of\naccelerated and ambient material vary with space and time, and why?\n  GRIPS's key technological improvements over the Reuven Ramaty High Energy\nSolar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI) include 3D position-sensitive germanium\ndetectors (3D-GeDs) and a single-grid, multi-pitch rotating modulator (MPRM)\ncollimator. The 3D-GeDs have spectral FWHM resolution of a few hundred keV and\nspatial resolution $<$1 mm$^3$. For photons that Compton scatter, usually\n$\\gtrsim$150 keV, the energy deposition sites can be tracked, providing\npolarization measurements as well as enhanced background reduction. The MPRM\nsingle-grid design provides twice the throughput of a bi-grid imaging system\nlike RHESSI. The grid is composed of 2.5 cm thick W/Cu slats with 1-13 mm\nvariable slit pitch, achieving quasi-continuous FWHM angular coverage over\n12.5-162 arcsecs. This resolution is capable of imaging the separate magnetic\nloop footpoint emissions in a variety of flare sizes.\n  (Abstract edited down from source.)\n", "  Here we give a brief review on the current bounds on the general Majorana\ntransition neutrino magnetic moments (TNMM) which cover also the conventional\nneutrino magnetic moments (NMM). Leptonic CP phases play a key role in\nconstraining TNMMs. While the Borexino experiment is the most sensitive to the\nTNMM magnitudes, one needs complementary information from reactor and\naccelerator experiments in order to probe the complex CP phases.\n", "  Soft and pliable conductive polymer composites hold promise for application\nas bioelectronic interfaces such as for electroencephalography (EEG). In\nclinical, laboratory, and real-world EEG there is a desire for dry, soft, and\ncomfortable interfaces to the scalp that are capable of relaying the\nmicrovolt-level scalp potentials to signal processing electronics. A key\nchallenge is that most material approaches are sensitive to deformation-induced\nshifts in electrical impedance associated with decreased signal-to-noise ratio.\nThis is a particular concern in real-world environments where human motion is\npresent. The entire set of brain information outside of tightly controlled\nlaboratory or clinical settings are currently unobtainable due to this\nchallenge. Here we explore the performance of an elastomeric material solution\npurposefully designed for dry, soft, comfortable scalp contact electrodes for\nEEG that is specifically targeted to have flat electrical impedance response to\ndeformation to enable utilization in real world environments. A conductive\ncarbon nanofiber filled polydimethylsiloxane (CNF-PDMS) elastomer was evaluated\nat three fill ratios (3, 4 and 7 volume percent). To evaluate usability for\nEEG, pre-recorded human EEG signals were replayed through the contact\nelectrodes subjected to quasi-static compressive strains between zero and 35%.\nThese tests show that conductive filler ratios well above the electrical\npercolation threshold are desirable in order to maximize signal-to-noise ratio\nand signal correlation with an ideal baseline. Increasing fill ratios yield\nincreasingly flat electrical impedance response to large applied compressive\ndeformations with a trade in increased material stiffness, and with nominal\nelectrical impedance tunable over greater than 4 orders of magnitude.\n", "  We introduce a class of so called Markovian marginals, which gives a natural\nframework for constructing solutions to the quantum marginal problem. We\nconsider a set of marginals that possess a certain internal quantum Markov\nchain structure. If they are equipped with such a structure and are locally\nconsistent on their overlapping supports, there exists a global state that is\nconsistent with all the marginals. The proof is constructive, and relies on a\nreduction of the marginal problem to a certain combinatorial problem. By\nemploying an entanglement entropy scaling law, we give a physical argument that\nthe requisite structure exists in any states with finite correlation lengths.\nThis includes topologically ordered states as well as finite temperature Gibbs\nstates.\n", "  The de Finetti representation theorem for continuous variable quantum system\nis first developed to approximate an N-partite continuous variable quantum\nstate with a convex combination of independent and identical subsystems, which\nrequires the original state to obey permutation symmetry conditioned on\nsuccessful experimental verification on k of N subsystems. We generalize the de\nFinetti theorem to include asymmetric bounds on the variance of canonical\nobservables and biased basis selection during the verification step. Our result\nthereby enables application of infinite-dimensional de Finetti theorem to\nsituations where two conjugate measurements obey different statistics, such as\nthe security analysis of quantum key distribution protocols based on squeezed\nstate against coherent attack.\n", "  A mechanism of a chiral spin wave rotation is introduced to systematically\ngenerate mesoscopic Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states.\n", "  It is a fundamental property of quantum mechanics that information is lost as\na result of performing measurements. Indeed, with every quantum measurement one\ncan associate a number -- its POVM norm constant -- that quantifies how much\nthe distinguishability of quantum states degrades in the worst case as a result\nof the measurement. This raises the obvious question which measurements\npreserve the most information in these sense of having the largest norm\nconstant. While a number of near-optimal schemes have been found (e.g. the\nuniform POVM, or complex projective 4-designs), they all seem to be difficult\nto implement in practice. Here, we analyze the distinguishability of quantum\nstates under measurements that are orbits of the Clifford group. The Clifford\ngroup plays an important role e.g. in quantum error correction, and its\nelements are considered simple to implement. We find that the POVM norm\nconstants of Clifford orbits depend on the effective rank of the states that\nshould be distinguished, as well as on a quantitative measure of the \"degree of\nlocalization in phase space\" of the vectors in the orbit. The most important\nClifford orbit is formed by the set of stabilizer states. Our main result\nimplies that stabilizer measurements are essentially optimal for distinguishing\npure quantum states. As an auxiliary result, we use the methods developed here\nto prove new entropic uncertainty relations for stabilizer measurements. This\npaper is based on a very recent analysis of the representation theory of tensor\npowers of the Clifford group.\n", "  I discuss the spectral energy distribution (SED) of all blazars with redshift\ndetected by the {\\it Fermi} satellite and listed in the 3LAC catalog. I will\nupdate the so called \"blazar sequence\" from the phenomenological point of view,\nwith no theory or modelling. I will show that: i) pure data show that jet and\naccretion power are related; ii) the updated blazar sequence maintains the\nproperties of the old version, albeit with a less pronounced dominance of the\n$\\gamma$--ray emission; iii) at low bolometric luminosities, two different type\nof objects have the same high energy power: low black hole mass flat spectrum\nradio quasars and high mass BL Lacs. Therefore, at low luminosities, there is a\nvery large dispersion of SED shapes; iv) in low power BL Lacs, the contribution\nof the host galaxy is important. Remarkably, the luminosity distribution of the\nhost galaxies of BL Lacs are spread in a very narrow range; v) a simple sum of\ntwo smoothly joining power laws can describe the blazar SEDs very well.\n", "  We derive the statistical limit of the spectral autocorrelation function and\nof the survival probability for the indirect photodissociation of molecules in\nthe regime of non-overlapping resonances. The results are derived in the\nframework of random matrix theory, and hold more generally for any chaotic\nquantum system that is weakly coupled to the continuum. The \"correlation hole\"\nthat characterizes the spectral autocorrelation in the bound molecule\ndiminishes as the typical average total width of a resonance increases.\n", "  The electron transfer in different solvents is investigated for systems\nconsisting of donor, bridge and acceptor. It is assumed that vibrational\nrelaxation is much faster than the electron transfer. Electron transfer rates\nand final populations of the acceptor state are calculated numerically and in\nan approximate fashion analytically. In wide parameter regimes these solutions\nare in very good agreement. The theory is applied to the electron transfer in\n${\\rm H_2P-ZnP-Q}$ with free-base porphyrin (${\\rm H_2P}$) being the donor,\nzinc porphyrin (${\\rm ZnP}$) the bridge, and quinone (${\\rm Q}$) the acceptor.\nIt is shown that the electron transfer rates can be controlled efficiently by\nchanging the energy of the bridging level which can be done by changing the\nsolvent. The effect of the solvent is determined for different models.\n", "  We investigate the effects of impurity scattering on the conductance of\nmetallic carbon nanotubes as a function of the relative separation of the\nimpurities. First we compute the conductance of a clean (6,6) tube, and the\neffect of model gold contacts on this conductance. Then, we compute the effect\nof introducing a single, two, and three oxygen atom impurities. We find that\nthe conductance of a single-oxygen-doped (6,6) nanotube decreases by about 30 %\nwith respect to that of the perfect nanotube. The presence of a second doping\natom induces strong changes of the conductance which, however, depend very\nstrongly on the relative position of the two oxygen atoms. We observe regular\noscillations of the conductance that repeat over an O-O distance that\ncorresponds to an integral number of half Fermi-wavelengths ($m\\lambda_F/2$).\nThese fluctuations reflect strong electron interference phenomena produced by\nelectron scattering from the oxygen defects whose contribution to the\nresistance of the tube cannot be obtained by simply summing up their individual\ncontributions.\n", "  This note discusses the relationship between a given intramolecular bridge\nassisted electron transfer rate and the corresponding zero bias molecular\nconduction of the same molecular species.\n", "  We compute the structure of an azamacrocycle, C26H18N6. Two approximatively\nplanar elliptical structures with C2 or CI symmetry are found to be nearly\ndegenerate. The roughly circular conformation observed in metal complexes turns\nout to be ~ 0.6 eV higher in energy. We suggest that this difference is mainly\ndue to electrostatic interactions. We discuss the results on various levels of\ntheory (Hartree-Fock, local density and gradient corrected density functional\ncalculations).\n", "  This paper presents results of numerical simulations of electron tunneling\nthrough water that extend our previous calculations on such systems in several\nways. First, a tip-substrate configuration is used; second, calculations are\ncarried in the presence of an external potential bias; third, the image\npotential that reflects the interaction of the electron with the mobile metal\nelectrons is taken into account in the static image approximation. Finally,\nall-to-all transmission probability calculations are performed in order to get\nan order-of-magnitude estimate of the current-voltage characteristics of this\njunction model. The computed currents are within the range of the few available\nexperimental observations on scanning tunneling microscope (STM) currents in\nwater, indicating that our calculation may have taken into account all the\nimportant physical attributes of such systems. In addition we examine the\neffect of the water medium on the spatial distribution of the tunneling flux.\nWe find that while different water configurations scatter the tunneling\nelectron in different ways, on the average the water affected loss of\nresolution is rather small in the deep tunneling regime but can be substantial\nin energy regimes where the tunneling is strongly affected by water-supported\nresonance structures.\n", "  We propose a theoretical investigation in this paper to understand the\nbonding and structural properties of neutral Al4Na4 and anion Al4Na3- clusters.\nWe show that the Al4 species in Al4Na4 and Al4Na3- clusters is a rectangular\nplanar structure with alternate pi-bonds and hence satisfying the basic\ncriteria for anti-aromaticity. We prove that the Al4Na4 and Al4Na3- clusters\nare metallo-anti-aromatic compounds.\n", "  We investigate the linear and nonlinear electric polarizabilities of small\nAl4M4 (M=Li, Na and K) clusters. Quantum chemical calculations reveal that\nthese compounds exhibit an exceptionally high magnitude of linear and nonlinear\noptical (NLO) coefficients which are orders of magnitude higher than the\nconventional pi-conjugated systems of similar sizes. We attribute such\nphenomenal increase to non-centrosymmetricity incorporated in the systems by\nthe alkali atoms surrounding the ring leading to charge transfer with small\noptical gap and low bond length alternation (BLA). Such a low magnitude of the\nBLA from a different origin, suggests the possibility that these clusters are\naromatic in character and along with the large NLO coefficients they appear to\nbe better candidates for next generation NLO fabrication devices.\n", "  Local reactivity descriptors such as the condensed local softness and Fukui\nfunction have been employed to investigate the inter-cluster reactivity of the\nmetallo-aromatic (Al4Li- and Al4Na-) and anti-aromatic (Al4Li4 and Al4Na4)\ncompounds. We use the concept of group softness and group Fukui function to\nstudy the strength of the nucleophilicity of the Al4 unit in these compounds.\nOur analysis shows that the trend of nucleophilicity of the Al4 unit in the\nabove clusters is as follows;\n  Al4Li- > Al4Na- > Al4Li4 > Al4Na 4\n  For the first time we have used the reactivity descriptors to show that these\nclusters can act as electron donating systems and thus can be used as a\nmolecular cathode.\n", "  Density functional molecular dynamics simulations have been carried out to\nunderstand the finite temperature behavior of Au$_{19}$ and Au$_{20}$ clusters.\nAu$_{20}$ has been reported to be a unique molecule having tetrahedral\ngeometry, a large HOMO-LUMO energy gap and an atomic packing similar to that of\nthe bulk gold (J. Li et al., Science, {\\bf 299} 864, 2003). Our results show\nthat the geometry of Au$_{19}$ is exactly identical to that of Au$_{20}$ with\none missing corner atom (called as vacancy). Surprisingly, our calculated heat\ncapacities for this nearly identical pair of gold cluster exhibit dramatic\ndifferences. Au$_{20}$ undergoes a clear and distinct solid like to liquid like\ntransition with a sharp peak in the heat capacity curve around 770 K. On the\nother hand, Au$_{19}$ has a broad and flat heat capacity curve with continuous\nmelting transition. This continuous melting transition turns out to be a\nconsequence of a process involving series of atomic rearrangements along the\nsurface to fill in the missing corner atom. This results in a restricted\ndiffusive motion of atoms along the surface of Au$_{19}$ between 650 K to 900 K\nduring which the shape of the ground state geometry is retained. In contrast,\nthe tetrahedral structure of Au$_{20}$ is destroyed around 800 K, and the\ncluster is clearly in a liquid like state above 1000 K. Thus, this work clearly\ndemonstrates that (i) the gold clusters exhibit size sensitive variations in\nthe heat capacity curves and (ii) the broad and continuous melting transition\nin a cluster, a feature which has so far been attributed to the disorder or\nabsence of symmetry in the system, can also be a consequence of a defect\n(absence of a cap atom) in the structure.\n", "  We introduce a method of molecular dynamics in shape space aimed at metal\nclusters. The ionic degrees of freedom are described via a dynamically\ndeformable jellium with inertia parameters derived from an incompressible,\nirrotational flow. The shell correction method is used to calculate the\nelectronic potential energy surface underlying the dynamics. Our finite\ntemperature simulations of Ag_14 and its ions, following the negative to\nneutral to positive scheme, demonstrate the potential of pump and probe\nultrashort laser pulses as a spectroscopy of cluster shape vibrations.\n", "  The nature of the CH2Cl2 neutral/acidic hydrolysis reaction from ambient to\nsupercritical conditions (25 C to 600 C at 246 bar) is explored. Of primary\ninterest is the effect of the changing dielectric behavior of the water solvent\nover this temperature range on this reaction. Experiments reveal that\nsignificant CH2Cl2 hydrolysis occurs under subcritical temperatures, while\nrelatively little hydrolysis occurs under supercritical conditions. These\ntrends cannot be explain by simple Arrhenius behavior. A combination of\nKirkwood theory and ab initio modeling provides a means of successfully\naccounting for this behavior both qualitatively and quantitatively. The results\nshow that increases in the activation energy and a changing reaction profile\nwith a decreasing dielectric constant provide a mechanism for a slowing of the\nreaction at higher temperatures by as much as three orders of magnitude. These\nsolvent effects are captured quantitatively in a correction factor to the\nArrenius form of the rate constant, which is incorporated into a global rate\nexpression proposed for CH2Cl2 hydrolysis that provides good predictions of the\nexperimental data.\n", "  The effect of dissociation of the invading electrolyte on the formation of\nLiesegang bands is investigated. We find, using organic compounds with known\ndissociation constants, that the spacing coefficient, 1+p, that characterizes\nthe position of the n-th band as x_n ~ (1+p)^n, decreases with increasing\ndissociation constant, K_d. Theoretical arguments are developed to explain\nthese experimental findings and to calculate explicitly the K_d dependence of\n1+p.\n", "  Recently we presented a new band structure for La(2-x)Sr(x)CuO(4) and other\nhigh temperature superconductors in which a second narrow band was seen to\ncross the primary band at the Fermi level. The existence of this second Fermi\nlevel band is in complete disagreement with the commonly accepted LDA band\nstructure. Yet it provided a crucial piece of physics which led to an\nexplanation for superconductivity and other unusual phenomena in these\nmaterials. In this work we present details as to the nature of the failure of\nconventional methods in deriving the band structure of the cuprates. In\nparticular, we use a number of chemical analogues to describe the problem of\nstatic correlation in the band structure calculations and show how this can be\ncorrected with the predictable outcome of a Fermi level band crossing.\n", "  A microscopic theory for the NMR anomalies of the planar Cu and O sites in\nsuperconducting La_1.85Sr_0.15CuO_4 is presented that quantitatively explains\nthe observations without the need to invoke anit-ferromagnetic spin\nfluctuations on the planar Cu sites and its significant discrepancy with the\nobserved incommensurate neutron spin fluctuations. The theory is derived from\nthe recently published ab-initio band structure calculations that correct LDA\ncomputations tendency to overestimate the self-coulomb repulsion for the\nhalf-filled Cu d_x2-y2 orbital for these ionic systems. The new band structure\nleads to two bands at the Fermi level with holes in the Cu d_z2 and apical O\np_z orbitals in addition to the standard Cu d_x2-y2 and planar O p_sigma\norbitals. This band structure is part of a new theory for the cuprates that\nexplains a broad range of experiments and is based upon the formation of Cooper\npairs comprised of a k up spin electron from one band and a -k down spin\nelectron from another band (Interband Pairing Model).\n", "  We apply the Merrifield variational method to the Holstein molecular crystal\nmodel in D dimensions to compute non-adiabatic polaron band energies and\nFranck-Condon factors at general crystal momenta. We analyze these observable\nproperties to extract characteristic features related to polaron self-trapping\nand potential experimental signatures. These results are combined with others\nobtained by the Global-Local variational method in 1D to construct a polaron\nphase diagram encompassing all degrees of adiabaticity and all electron-phonon\ncoupling strengths. The polaron phase diagram so constructed includes disjoint\nregimes occupied by \"small\" polarons, \"large\" polarons, and a newly-defined\nclass of \"compact\" polarons, all mutually separated by an intermediate regime\noccupied by transitional structures.\n", "  The energetics of the gas-phase S$_N$2 reactions Y$^-$ + CH$_3$X\n$\\longrightarrow$ CH$_3$Y + X$^-$ (where X,Y = F, Cl, Br), were studied using\n(variants on) the recent W1 and W2 {\\em ab initio} computational\nthermochemistry methods. Our computed benchmark data (including cases for which\nexperimental data are unavailable altogether) are used to assess the quality of\na number of semiempirical compound thermochemistry schemes such as G2 theory,\nG3 theory, and CBS-QB3, as well as a variety of density functional theory\nmethods. Upon applying some modifications to the level of theory used for the\nreference geometry (adding diffuse functions, replacing B3LYP by the very\nrecently proposed mPW1K functional), the compound methods appear to perform\nwell. Only the 'half-and-half' functionals BH&HLYP and mPWH&HPW91, and the\nempirical mPW1K functional, consistently find all required stationary points;\nthe other functionals fail to find a transition state in the F/Br case. BH&HLYP\nand mPWH&HPW91 somewhat overcorrect for the tendency of B3LYP (and, to a lesser\nextent, mPW1PW91) to underestimate barrier heights. The Becke97 and Becke97-1\nfunctionals perform similarly to B3LYP for the problem under study, while the\nHCTH and HCTH-120 functionals both appear to underestimate central barriers.\nHCTH underestimates complexation energies; this problem is resolved in\nHCTH-120. mPW1K appears to exhibit the best performance of the functionals\nconsidered, although its energetics are still inferior to the compound\nthermochemistry methods.\n", "  We develop a Feynman rule for energy-level diagrams emphasizing their\nconnections to the double-sided Feynman diagrams and physical processes in the\nLiouville space. Thereby we completely identify such diagrams and processes\ncontributing to the two-dimensional response function in the Brownian\noscillator model. We classify such diagrams or processes in quartet and\nnumerically present signals separately from each quartet of diagrams or\nLiouville-space processes. We find that the signal from each quartet is\ndistinctly different from the others; we can identify each peaks in frequency\ndomain with a certain quartet. This offers the basis for analyzing and\nassigning actual two-dimensional peaks and suggests the possibility of\nLiouville-space-path selective spectroscopy. As an application we demonstrate\nan example in which two familiar homogeneous mechanisms of relaxation are\ndistinguished by existence or non-existence of certain peaks on the\ntwo-dimensional map; appearance or disappearance of certain peak is sensitive\nto the coupling mechanism. We also point out some confusion in the literature\nwith regard to inclusion of relaxation effects.\n", "  The paper presents a theoretical study of the dynamics of the H + HCl system\non the potential energy surface (PES) of Bian and Werner (Bian, W.; Werner, H.\n-J., J. Chem. Phys. 2000, 112, 220). A time-dependent wave packet approach was\nemployed to calculate state-to-state reaction probabilities for the exchanged\nand abstraction channels. The most recent PES for the system has been used in\nthe calculations. Reaction probabilities have also been calculated for several\nvalues of the total angular momentum J > 0. Those have then been used to\nestimate cross sections and rate constants for both channels. The calculated\ncross sections can be compared with the results of previous quasiclassical\ntrajectory calculations and reaction dynamics experimental on the abstraction\nchannel. In addition, the calculated rate constants are in the reasonably good\nagreement with experimental measurement.\n", "  Imidazoline-based nitroxide radicals are often used as spin probes for medium\nacidity and polarity in different systems. In this work, using the density\nfunctional theory (DFT) approach, we have studied how physico-chemical\ncharacteristics (geometry, atomic charges and electron spin density\ndistribution) of pH-sensitive spin label\n4-amino-2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-3-imidazoline-N-oxyl (ATI) depend on protonation\nand aqueous surroundings. Our calculations demonstrate that ATI protonation\nshould occur at the nitrogen atom of the imidazoline ring rather than at the\namino group. Protonation of ATI leads to a decrease in a spin density on the\nnitrogen atom of the nitroxide fragment >N-O. For simulation of ATI hydration\neffects, we have constructed a water shell around a spin label molecule by\nmeans of gradual (step-by-step) surrounding of ATI with water molecules (n =\n2-41). Calculated spin density on the nitrogen atom of the nitroxide fragment\nincreased with an extension of a water shell around ATI. Both protonation and\nhydration of ATI caused certain changes in calculated geometric parameters\n(bond lengths and valence angles). Investigating how structural and energy\nparameters of a system ATI-(H2O)n depend on a number of surrounding water\nmolecules, we came to the conclusion that a hydrogen-bonded cluster of n\n&#8805; 41 water molecules could be considered as an appropriate model for\nsimulation of ATI hydration effects.\n", "  Time resolved transient absorption spectroscopy has been used to determine\nquantum yields for electron photodetachment in 193 nm and (where possible) 248\nnm laser excitation of miscellaneous aqueous anions, including\nhexacyanoferrate(II), sulfate, sulfite, halide anions (Cl-, Br-, and I-),\npseudohalide anions (OH-, HS-, CNS-), and several common inorganic anions for\nwhich no quantum yields have been reported heretofore: SO3=, NO2-, NO3-, ClO3-\nand ClO4-. Molar extinction coefficients for these anions and photoproducts of\nelectron detachment from these anions at the excitation wavelengths were also\ndetermined. These results are discussed in the context of recent ultrafast\nkinetic studies and compared with the previous data obtained by product\nanalyses. We suggest using electron photodetachment from the aqueous halide and\npseudohalide anions as actinometric standard for time-resolved studies of\naqueous photosystems in the UV.\n", "  In concentrated solutions of NaClO4 and Na2SO4, the quantum yield for free\nelectron generated by detachment from photoexcited anions (such as I-, OH-,\nClO^4-, and [SO3]^2-) linearly decreases by 6-12% per 1 M ionic strength. In 9\nM sodium perchlorate solution, this quantum yield decreases by roughly an order\nof magnitude. Ultrafast kinetic studies of 200 nm photon induced electron\ndetachment from Br-, HO- and [SO3]^2- suggest that the prompt yield of\nthermalized electron does not change in these solutions; rather, the ionic\nstrength effect originates in more efficient recombination of geminate pairs.\nWithin the framework of the recently proposed mean force potential (MFP) model\nof charge separation dynamics in such photosystems, the observed changes are\ninterpreted as an increase in the short-range attractive potential between the\ngeminate partners. Association of sodium cation(s) with the electron and the\nparent anion is suggested as the most likely cause for the observed\nmodification of the MFP. Electron thermalization kinetics suggest that the\ncation associated with the parent anion (by ion pairing and/or ionic atmosphere\ninteraction) is passed to the detached electron in the course of the\nphotoreaction. The precise atomic-level mechanism for the ionic strength effect\nis presently unclear; any further advance is likely to require the development\nof an adequate quantum molecular dynamics model.\n", "  Picosecond geminate recombination kinetics for electrons generated by\nmultiphoton ionization of liquid water become power dependent when the radiance\nof the excitation light is greater than 0.3-0.5 TW/cm^2 (the terawatt regime).\nTo elucidate the mechanism of this power dependence, tri- 400 nm photon\nionization of water has been studied using pump-probe laser spectroscopy on the\npico- and femtosecond time scales. We suggest that the observed kinetic\ntransformations are caused by a rapid temperature jump in the sample. Such a\njump is inherent to multiphoton ionization in the terawatt regime, when the\nabsorption of the pump light along the optical path becomes very nonuniform.\nThe heating of water is substantial (tens of degrees C) because the 3-photon\nquantum yield of the ionization is relatively low, ca. 0.42, and a large\nfraction of the excitation energy is released into the solvent bulk as heat.\nEvidence of the temperature jump is the observation of a red shift in the\nabsorption spectrum of (thermalized) electron and by characteristic\n\"flattening\" of the thermalization dynamics in the near infra-red. The\ntemperature jump in the terawatt regime might be ubiquitous in multiphoton\nionization in molecular liquids. The implications of these observations for\nfemtosecond pulse radiolysis of water are discussed.\n", "  Clusters of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules are modelled\nusing explicit all-atom potentials using a rigid body approximation. The PAH's\nconsidered range from pyrene (C10H8) to circumcoronene (C54H18), and clusters\ncontaining between 2 and 32 molecules are investigated. In addition to the\nusual repulsion-dispersion interactions, electrostatic point-charge\ninteractions are incorporated, as obtained from density functional theory\ncalculations. The general electrostatic distribution in neutral or singly\ncharged PAH's is reproduced well using a fluctuating charges analysis, which\nprovides an adequate description of the multipolar distribution. Global\noptimization is performed using a variety of methods, including basin-hopping\nand parallel tempering Monte Carlo. We find evidence that stacking the PAH\nmolecules generally yields the most stable motif. A structural transition\nbetween one-dimensional stacks and three-dimensional shapes built from mutiple\nstacks is observed at larger sizes, and the threshold for this transition\nincreases with the size of the monomer. Larger aggregates seem to evolve toward\nthe packing observed for benzene in bulk.Difficulties met in optimizing these\nclusters are analysed in terms of the strong anisotropy of the molecules. We\nalso discuss segregation in heterogeneous clusters and vibrational properties\nin the context of astrophysical observations.\n", "  Monomers and small clusters of such molecules can reversibly trap conduction\nband electrons in dilute alkane solutions. The dynamics and energetics of this\ntrapping have been studied using pulse radiolysis - transient absorption\nspectroscopy and time-resolved photoconductivity. Binding energies, thermal\ndetrapping rates, and absorption spectra of excess electrons attached to\nmonomer and multimer solute traps are obtained and possible structures for\nthese species are discussed. \"Dipole coagulation\" (stepwise growth of the\nsolute cluster around the cavity electron) predicted by Mozumder in 1972 is\nobserved. Acetonitrile monomer is shown to solvate the electron by its methyl\ngroup, just like the alkane solvent does. The electron is dipole-bound to the\nCN group; the latter points away from the cavity. The resulting negatively\ncharged species has a binding energy of 0.4 eV and absorbs in the infrared.\nMolecules of straight-chain aliphatic alcohols solvate the excess electron by\ntheir OH groups; at equilibrium, the predominant electron trap is a trimer or a\ntetramer; the binding energy of this solute trap is ca. 0.8 eV. Trapping by\nsmaller clusters is opposed by the entropy which drives the equilibrium towards\nthe electron in a solvent trap. For alcohol monomers, the trapping does not\noccur; a slow proton transfer reaction occurs instead. For acetonitrile\nmonomer, the trapping is favored energetically but the thermal detachment is\nrapid (ca. 1 ns).\n", "  Photostimulated electron detachment from aqueous inorganic anions is the\nsimplest example of solvent-mediated electron transfer. Here we contrast the\nbehavior of halide anions with that of small polyatomic anions, such as\npseudohalide anions (e.g., HS-) and common polyvalent anions (e.g., SO32-).\nGeminate recombination dynamics of hydrated electrons generated by 200 nm\nphotoexcitation of aqueous anions (I-, Br-, OH-, HS-, CNS-, CO32-, SO32-, and\nFe(CN)64-) have been studied. Prompt quantum yields for the formation of\nsolvated, thermalized electrons and quantum yields for free electrons were\ndetermined. Pump-probe kinetics for 200 nm photoexcitation were compared with\nkinetics obtained at lower photoexcitation energy (225 nm or 242 nm) for the\nsame anions, where possible. Free diffusion and mean force potential models of\ngeminate recombination dynamics were used to analyze these kinetics. These\nanalyses suggest that for polyatomic anions (including all polyvalent anions\nstudied) the initial electron distribution has a broad component, even at\nrelatively low photoexcitation energy. There seem to be no well-defined\nthreshold energy below which the broadening of the distribution does not occur,\nas is the case for halide anions. Direct ionization to the conduction band of\nwater is the most likely photoprocess broadening the electron distribution. Our\nstudy suggests that halide anions are in the class of their own; electron\nphotodetachment from polyatomic, especially polyvalent, anions follows a\ndifferent set of rules.\n", "  The excess electron in liquid ammonia (\"ammoniated electron\") is commonly\nviewed as a cavity electron in which the s-type wave function fills the\ninterstitial void between 6-9 ammonia molecules. Here we examine an alternative\nmodel in which the ammoniated electron is regarded as a solvent stabilized\nmultimer radical anion, as was originally suggested by Symons [Chem. Soc. Rev.\n1976, 5, 337]. In this model, most of the excess electron density resides in\nthe frontier orbitals of N atoms in the ammonia molecules forming the solvation\ncavity; a fraction of this spin density is transferred to the molecules in the\nsecond solvation shell. The cavity is formed due to the repulsion between\nnegatively charged solvent molecules. Using density functional theory\ncalculations for small ammonia cluster anions in the gas phase, it is\ndemonstrated that such core anions would semi-quantitatively account for the\nobserved pattern of Knight shifts for 1-H and 14-N nuclei observed by NMR\nspectroscopy and the downshifted stretching and bending modes observed by\ninfrared spectroscopy. It is speculated that the excess electrons in other\naprotic solvents (but not in water and alcohols) might be, in this respect,\nanalogous to the ammoniated electron, with substantial transfer of the spin\ndensity into the frontier N and C orbitals of methyl, amino, and amide groups\nforming the solvation cavity.\n", "  We investigate the modification of photoluminescence (PL) from single\nsemiconductor nanocrystal quantum dots (NCs) in proximity of metal and\nsemiconducting Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) tips. The presence of the tip\nalters the radiative decay rate of an emitter via interference and opens\nefficient non radiative decay channels via energy transfer to the tip material.\nThese effects cause quenching (or enhancement) of the emitter's PL intensity,\nas a function of its distance from the interacting tip. We take advantage of\nthis highly distance dependent effect to realize a contrast mechanism for high\nresolution optical imaging. AFM tips are optimized as energy acceptors by\nchemical functionalization with InAs NCs to achieve optical resolution down to\n30 nm. The presented experimental scheme offers high resolution optical\ninformation while maintaining the benefits of traditional AFM imaging. We\ndirectly measure the PL intensity of single NCs as a function of the tip\ndistance. Our results are in good agreement to calculation made by a classical\ntheoretical model describing an oscillating dipole interacting with a planar\nmirror.\n", "  Is it possible to design a supramolecular cage that would \"solvate\" the\nexcess electron in the same fashion in which several solvent molecules do that\nco-operatively in polar liquids? Two general strategies are outlined for\n\"electron encapsulation,\" viz. electron localization using polar groups\narranged on the (i) inside of the cage or (ii) outside of the cage. The second\napproach is limited to polynitriles. We demonstrate that the latter faces a\nformidable problem: the electron attaches to the nitrile groups forming\nmolecular anions with bent C-C-N fragments. Since the energy cost of this\nbending is very high, for dinitrile anions in n-hexane, the binding energies\nfor the electron are very low and for mononitriles, these binding energies are\nlower still, and the entropy of electron attachment is anomalously small.\nDensity functional theory modeling of electron trapping by mononitriles in\nn-hexane suggests that the mononitrile molecules substitute for the solvent\nmolecules at the electron cavity, \"solvating\" the electron by their methyl\ngroups. Such \"solvated electrons\" resemble multimer radical anions in which the\nelectron density is shared (mainly) between C 2p orbitals in the solute/solvent\nmolecules, instead of existing as cavity electrons. The way in which the excess\nelectron density is shared by such molecules is similar to the way in which\nthis sharing occurs in large di- and poly- nitrile anions, such as\n1,2,4,5,7,8,10,11-octacyano-cyclododecane anion. The work thus reveals\nlimitations of the concept of \"solvated electron\" for organic liquids. It also\ndemostrates the feasibility of \"electron encapsulation.\"\n", "  Density functional theory (DFT) is used to rationalize magnetic parameters of\nhydrated electron trapped in alkaline glasses as observed using Electron\nParamagnetic Resonance (EPR) and Electron Spin Echo Envelope Modulation (ESEEM)\nspectroscopies. To this end, model water cluster anions (n=4-8 and n=20,24)\nthat localize the electron internally are examined. It is shown that EPR\nparameters of such water anions (such as hyperfine coupling tensors of H/D\nnuclei in the water molecules) are defined mainly by the cavity size and the\ncoordination number of the electron; the water molecules in the second\nsolvation shell play a relatively minor role. An idealized model of hydrated\nelectron (that is usually attributed to L. Kevan) in which six hydroxyl groups\narranged in an octahedral pattern point towards the common center is shown to\nprovide the closest match to the experimental parameters, such as isotropic and\nanisotropic hyperfine coupling constants for the protons (estimated from\nESEEM), the second moment of the EPR spectra, and the radius of gyration. The\nsalient feature of these DFT models is the significant transfer (10-20%) of\nspin density into the frontal O 2p orbitals of water molecules. Spin bond\npolarization involving these oxygen orbitals accounts for small, negative\nhyperfine coupling constants for protons in hydroxyl groups that form the\nelectron-trapping cavity. In Part 2, these results are generalized for more\nrealistic geometries of core anions obtained using a dynamic one-electron mixed\nqunatum/classical molecular dynamics model.\n", "  Adiabatic mixed quantum/classical molecular dynamics simulations were used to\ngenerate snapshots of the hydrated electron (e-) in liquid water at 300 K.\nWater cluster anions that include two complete solvation shells centered on the\ne- were extracted from these simulations and embedded in a matrix of fractional\npoint charges designed to represent the rest of the solvent. Density functional\ntheory and single-excitation configuration interaction methods were then\napplied to these embedded clusters. The salient feature of these hybrid\ncalculations is significant transfer (ca. 0.18) of the excess electron's charge\ndensity into the O 2p orbitals in OH groups forming the solvation cavity. We\nused the results of these calculations to examine the structure of the\nmolecular orbitals, the density of states, the absorption spectra in the\nvisible and ultraviolet, the hyperfine coupling (hfc) tensors, and the IR and\nRaman spectra of the e-. The calculated hfc tensors were used to compute the\nEPR and ESEEM spectra for the e- that compared favorably to the experimental\nspectra of trapped e- in alkaline ice. The calculated vibrational spectra of\nthe e- are consistent with the red-shifted bending and stretching frequencies\nobserved in resonance Raman experiments. The model also accounts for the VIS\nand 190-nm absorption bands of the e-. Thus, our study suggests that to explain\nseveral important experimentally observed properties of the e-, many-electron\neffects must be accounted for.\n", "  The aromaticity in the polyacene analogues of several inorganic ring\ncompounds (BN-acenes, CN-acenes, BO-acenes and Na6-acenes) is reported here for\nthe first time. Conceptual density functional theory based reactivity\ndescriptors and the nucleus independent chemical shift (NICS) values are used\nin this analysis.\n", "  The dynamics of vibrational wave packets excited in Na2 dimers in the triplet\nground and excited states is investigated by means of helium nanodroplet\nisolation (HENDI) combined with femtosecond pump-probe spectroscopy. Different\npathways in the employed resonant multi-photon ionization scheme are\nidentified. Within the precision of the method, the wave packet dynamics\nappears to be unperturbed by the helium droplet environment.\n", "  Reported here are results of theoretical calculations on the hexaaquoferric\ncomplex and deprotonated products to investigate the molecular mechanisms of\nhydrolysis of ferric ion in water. The combination of density functional\nelectronic structure techniques and a dielectric continuum model for\nelectrostatic solvation applied to the Fe(H$_2$O)$_6$$^{3+}$ complex yields\n-1020~kcal/mol (experimental values -1037~kcal/mol to -1019~kcal/mol) for the\nabsolute free energy of the aqueous ferric ion. The predicted reaction energy\nchange for the first hydrolysis is 2 kcal/mol (compared to 3 kcal/mol\nexperimental). For the second hydrolysis, we found an unexpected low energy\nisomer of Fe(H$_2$O)$_4$(OH)$_2$$^{+}$ with five ligands in the inner sphere\nand one water outside. The cis and trans isomers are, respectively, slightly\nlower and higher in energy. Extrusion of the additional water to the outer\nsphere is nearly thermoneutral. The reaction free energy for the second\nhydrolysis is predicted in the range 16-18~kcal/mol, higher than the\nexperimental value of 5~kcal/mol. Since the theoretical predictions for the\nsecond hydrolysis are higher than experimental values and novel structures were\nencountered, we argue that conformational entropy is important in these\nreactions.\n", "  Recent developments in molecular theories and simulation of ions and polar\nmolecules in water are reviewed. The hydration of imidazole and imidazolium\nsolutes is used to exemplify the theoretical issues. The treatment of\nlong-ranged electrostatic interactions in simulations is discussed extensively.\nIt is argued that the Ewald approach is an easy way to get correct hydration\nfree energies in the thermodynamic limit from molecular calculations; and that\nmolecular simulations with Ewald interactions and periodic boundary conditions\ncan also be more efficient than many common alternatives. The Ewald treatment\npermits a conclusive extrapolation to infinite system size. The picture that\nemerges from testing of simple models is that the most prominent failings of\nthe simplest theories are associated with solvent proton conformations that\nlead to non-gaussian fluctuations of electrostatic potentials. Thus, the most\nfavorable cases for the second-order perturbation theories are monoatomic\npositive ions. For polar and anionic solutes, continuum or gaussian theories\nare less accurate. The appreciation of the specific deficiencies of those\nsimple models have led to new concepts, multistate gaussian and quasi-chemical\ntheories, that address the cases for which the simpler theories fail. It is\nargued that, relative to direct dielectric continuum treatments, the\nquasi-chemical theories provide a better theoretical organization for the\ncomputational study of the electronic structure of solution species.\n", "  In order to resolve a significant uncertainty in the heat of vaporization of\nsilicon -- a fundamental parameter in gas-phase thermochemistry -- $\\Delta\nH^\\circ_{f,0}$[Si(g)] has been determined from a thermochemical cycle involving\nthe precisely known experimental heats of formation of SiF_4(g) and F(g) and a\nbenchmark calculation of the total atomization energy (TAE_0) of SiF_4 using\ncoupled-cluster methods. Basis sets up to $[8s7p6d4f2g1h]$ on Si and\n$[7s6p5d4f3g2h]$ on F have been employed, and extrapolations for residual basis\nset incompleteness applied. The contributions of inner-shell correlation (-0.08\nkcal/mol), scalar relativistic effects (-1.88 kcal/mol), atomic spin-orbit\nsplitting (-1.97 kcal/mol), and anharmonicity in the zero-point energy (+0.04\nkcal/mol) have all been explicitly accounted for. Our benchmark TAE_0=565.89\n\\pm 0.22 kcal/mol leads to $\\Delta H^\\circ_{f,0}$[Si(g)]=107.15 \\pm 0.38\nkcal/mol ($\\Delta H^\\circ_{f,298}$[Si(g)]=108.19 \\pm 0.38 kcal/mol): between\nthe JANAF/CODATA value of 106.5 \\pm 1.9 kcal/mol and the revised value proposed\nby Grev and Schaefer [J. Chem. Phys. 97, 8389 (1992}], 108.1 \\pm 0.5 kcal/mol.\nThe revision will be relevant for future computational studies on heats of\nformation of silicon compounds.\n", "  Motivated by recent experiments on photon statistics from individual dye\npairs planted on biomolecules and coupled by fluorescence resonance energy\ntransfer (FRET), we show here that the FRET dynamics can be modelled by\nGaussian random processes with colored noise. Using Monte-Carlo numerical\nsimulations, the photon intensity correlations from the FRET pairs are\ncalculated, and are turned out to be very close to those observed in\nexperiment. The proposed stochastic description of FRET is consistent with\nexisting theories for microscopic dynamics of the biomolecule that carries the\nFRET coupled dye pairs.\n", "  We study a general problem of the\ntranslational/rotational/vibrational/electronic dynamics of a diatomic molecule\nexposed to an interaction with an arbitrary external electromagnetic field. The\ntheory developed in this paper is relevant to a variety of specific\napplications. Such as, alignment or orientation of molecules by lasers,\ntrapping of ultracold molecules in optical traps, molecular optics and\ninterferometry, rovibrational spectroscopy of molecules in the presence of\nintense laser light, or generation of high order harmonics from molecules.\nStarting from the first quantum mechanical principles, we derive an appropriate\nmolecular Hamiltonian suitable for description of the center of mass,\nrotational, vibrational and electronic molecular motions driven by the field\nwithin the electric dipole approximation. Consequently, the concept of the\nBorn-Oppenheimer separation between the electronic and the nuclear degrees of\nfreedom in the presence of an electromagnetic field is introduced. Special\ncases of the dc/ac field limits are then discussed separately. Finally, we\nconsider a perturbative regime of a weak dc/ac field, and obtain simple\nanalytic formulas for the associated Born-Oppenheimer\ntranslational/rotational/vibrational molecular Hamiltonian.\n"]}
