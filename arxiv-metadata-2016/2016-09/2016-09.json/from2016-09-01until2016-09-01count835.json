lateral\nJosephson junctions with a graphene barrier, obtained by a phase-sensitive\nSQUID interferometry technique. We find that the current-phase relation is\nforward skewed with respect to the commonly observed sinusoidal behavior for\nshort junctions in the quasi-ballistic transport regime, consistent with\npredictions for the behavior of Dirac fermions in a Josephson junction. The\nskewness increases with critical current and decreases sharply with increasing\ntemperature.\n", "  A step-by-step evolution of an asymmetric Raman line-shape function from a\nLorentzian line-shape is presented here for low dimensional semiconductors. The\nevolution reported here is based on the phonon confinement model which is\nsuccessfully used in literature to explain the asymmetric Raman line-shape from\nsemiconductor nano-structures. Physical significance of different terms in the\ntheoretical asymmetric Raman line-shape has been explained here. Better\nunderstanding of theoretical reasoning behind each term allows one to use the\ntheoretical Raman line-shape without going into details of theory from first\nprinciple. This will enable one to empirically derive a theoretical Raman\nline-shape function for any material if information about its phonon\ndispersion, size dependence etc is known.\n", "  The quantum mechanics of one-electron atoms in presence of external\nelectromagnetic fields is considered within Weber's framework. The results by\nthe earlier studies are extended in the sense that for given source and field\nconfigurations the changes of the electromagnetic potentials due to the curved\nbackground are included. The formulation is specialized to the case with\nSchwarzschild background. The first corrections to the energy levels for bare\natom and Zeeman/Stark effects are calculated, exhibiting possible changes in\nmeaningful orders.\n", "  Evolutionary game theory is a successful mathematical framework geared\ntowards understanding the selective pressures that affect the evolution of the\nstrategies of agents engaged in interactions with potential conflicts. While a\nmathematical treatment of the costs and benefits of decisions can predict the\noptimal strategy in simple settings, more realistic settings such as finite\npopulations, non-vanishing mutations rates, stochastic decisions, communication\nbetween agents, and spatial interactions, require agent-based methods where\neach agent is modeled as an individual, carries its own genes that determine\nits decisions, and where the evolutionary outcome can only be ascertained by\nevolving the population of agents forward in time. While highlighting standard\nmathematical results, we compare those to agent-based methods that can go\nbeyond the limitations of equations and simulate the complexity of\nheterogeneous populations and an ever-changing set of interactors. We conclude\nthat agent-based methods can predict evolutionary outcomes where purely\nmathematical treatments cannot tread (for example in the weak selection--strong\nmutation limit), but that mathematics is crucial to validate the computational\nsimulations.\n", "  A comparison of porous structures formed from silicon (Si) wafers with\ndifferent resistivities has been reported here based on the morphological\nstudies carried out using scanning electron microscope (SEM). The porous Si\nsamples have been prepared using metal induced etching (MIE) technique from two\ndifferent Si wafers having two different resistivities. It is observed that\nporous Si containing well aligned Si nanowires are formed from high resistivity\n(1-20 $\\Omega$cm) Si wafer whereas interconnected pores or cheese like\nstructures are formed from low resistivity (0.02 $\\Omega$cm ) Si wafers after\nMIE. An explanation for the different porosification processes has also been\nproposed based on the initial doping level where number of dopants seems to be\nplaying an important role on the etching process. Visible photoluminescence\nhave been observed from all the porous samples possibly due to quantum\nconfinement effect.\n", "  This is the draft/updated version of a textbook on \"real-world\" applications\nof the AdS/CFT duality for beginning graduate students in particle physics and\nfor researchers in the other fields. The aim of this book is to provide\nbackground materials such as string theory, general relativity, nuclear\nphysics, nonequilibrium physics, and condensed-matter physics as well as some\nkey applications of the AdS/CFT duality in a single textbook. Contents: (1)\nIntroduction, (2) General relativity and black holes, (3) Black holes and\nthermodynamics, (4) Strong interaction and gauge theories, (5) The road to\nAdS/CFT, (6) The AdS spacetime, (7) AdS/CFT - equilibrium, (8) AdS/CFT - adding\nprobes, (9) Basics of nonequilibrium physics, (10) AdS/CFT - nonequilibrium,\n(11) Other AdS spacetimes, (12) Applications to quark-gluon plasma, (13) Basics\nof phase transition, (14) AdS/CFT - phase transition, (15) Exercises.\n", "  We study arrays of plasmonic nanoparticles combined with quantum emitters,\nquantum plasmonic lattices, as a platform for room temperature studies of\nquantum many-body physics. We outline a theory to describe surface plasmon\npolariton distributions when they are coupled to externally pumped molecules.\nThe possibility of tailoring the dispersion in plasmonic lattices allows\nrealization of a variety of distributions, including the Bose-Einstein\ndistribution as in photon condensation. We show that the presence of losses can\nrelax some of the standard dimensionality restrictions for condensation.\n", "  We argue that super-Planckian diameters of axion fundamental domains can\nnaturally arise in Calabi-Yau compactifications of string theory. In a theory\nwith $N$ axions $\\theta^i$, the fundamental domain is a polytope defined by the\nperiodicities of the axions, via constraints of the form $-\\pi<Q^{i}_{j}\n\\theta^j<\\pi$. We compute the diameter of the fundamental domain in terms of\nthe eigenvalues $f_1^2\\le\\...\\le f_N^2$ of the metric on field space, and also,\ncrucially, the largest eigenvalue of $(QQ^{\\top})^{-1}$. At large $N$,\n$QQ^{\\top}$ approaches a Wishart matrix, due to universality, and we show that\nthe diameter is at least $N f_{N}$, exceeding the naive Pythagorean range by a\nfactor $>\\sqrt{N}$. This result is robust in the presence of $P>N$ constraints,\nwhile for $P=N$ the diameter is further enhanced by eigenvector delocalization\nto $N^{3/2}f_N$. We directly verify our results in explicit Calabi-Yau\ncompactifications of type IIB string theory. In the classic example with\n$h^{1,1}=51$ where parametrically controlled moduli stabilization was\ndemonstrated by Denef et al. in [1], the largest metric eigenvalue obeys $f_N\n\\approx 0.013 M_{pl}$. The random matrix analysis then predicts, and we\nexhibit, axion diameters $>M_{pl}$ for the precise vacuum parameters found in\n[1]. Our results provide a framework for achieving large-field axion inflation\nin well-understood flux vacua.\n", "  On a metric measure space $X$ that supports a regular, strongly local\nresistance form we consider a magnetic energy form that corresponds to the\nmagnetic Laplacian for a particle confined to $X$. We provide sufficient\nconditions for closability and self-adjointness in terms of geometric\nconditions on the reference measure without assuming energy dominance.\n", "  We provide answers to long-lasting questions in the puzzling behavior of\nfullerene-fullerene fusion: Why are the fusion barriers so exceptionally high\nand the fusion cross sections so extremely small? An ab initio nonadiabatic\nquantum molecular dynamics (NA-QMD) analysis of C$_{60}$+C$_{60}$ collisions\nreveals that the dominant excitation of an exceptionally \"giant\" oblate-prolate\nH$_g(1)$ mode plays the key role in answering both questions. From these\nmicroscopic calculations, a macroscopic collision model is derived, which\nreproduces the NA-QMD results. Moreover, it predicts analytically fusion\nbarriers for different fullerene-fullerene combinations in excellent agreement\nwith experiments.\n", "  Several recent works have claimed that the Weak Gravity Conjecture (WGC)\nexcludes super-Planckian displacements of axion fields, and hence large-field\naxion inflation, in the absence of monodromy. We argue that in theories with\n$N\\gg1$ axions, super-Planckian axion diameters $\\cal{D}$ are readily allowed\nby the WGC. We clarify the nontrivial relationship between the kinetic matrix\n$K$ --- unambiguously defined by its form in a Minkowski-reduced basis --- and\nthe diameter of the axion fundamental domain, emphasizing that in general the\ndiameter is not solely determined by the eigenvalues $f_1^2 \\le ... \\le f_N^2$\nof $K$: the orientations of the eigenvectors with respect to the\nidentifications imposed by instantons must be incorporated. In particular, even\nif one were to impose the condition $f_N<M_{pl}$, this would imply neither\n${\\cal D}<M_{pl}$ nor ${\\cal D}<\\sqrt{N}M_{pl}$. We then estimate the actions\nof instantons that fulfill the WGC. The leading instanton action is bounded\nfrom below by $S \\ge {\\cal S} M_{pl}/f_N$, with ${\\cal S}$ a fixed constant,\nbut in the universal limit $S\\gtrsim {\\cal S} \\sqrt{N}M_{pl}/f_N$. Thus, having\n$f_N>M_{pl}$ does not immediately imply the existence of unsuppressed higher\nharmonic contributions to the potential. Finally, we argue that in effective\naxion-gravity theories, the zero-form version of the WGC can be satisfied by\ngravitational instantons that make negligible contributions to the potential.\n", "  Can C60 layer cover a surface of single-wall carbon nanotube (SWCNT) forming\nan exohedral pure-carbon hybrid with only VdW interactions? The paper addresses\nthis question and demonstrates that the fullerene shell layer in such a\nbucky-corn structure can be stable. Theoretical study of structure, stability\nand electronic properties of the following bucky-corn hybrids is reported: C60\nand C70 molecules on an individual SWCNT, C60 dimers on an individual SWCNT as\nwell C60 molecules on SWNT bundles. The geometry and total energies of the\nbucky-corns were calculated by the molecular dynamics method while the density\nfunctional theory method was used to simulate the electronic band structures.\n", "  We consider electromagnetic nonlinear normal modes in cylindrical cavity\nresonators filled with a nonlinear nondispersive medium. The key feature of the\nanalysis is that exact analytical solutions of the nonlinear field equations\nare employed to study the mode properties in detail. Based on such a\nnonperturbative approach, we rigorously prove that the total energy of free\nnonlinear oscillations in a distributive conservative system, such as that\nconsidered in our work, can exactly coincide with the sum of energies of the\nnormal modes of the system. This fact implies that the energy orthogonality\nproperty, which has so far been known to take place only for linear\noscillations and fields, can also be observed in the nonlinear oscillatory\nsystem.\n", "  Topological materials have become the focus of intense research in recent\nyears, since they exhibit fundamentally new physical phenomena with potential\napplications for novel devices and quantum information technology. One of the\nhallmarks of topological materials is the existence of protected gapless\nsurface states, which arise due to a nontrivial topology of the bulk wave\nfunctions. This review provides a pedagogical introduction into the field of\ntopological quantum matter with an emphasis on classification schemes. We\nconsider both fully gapped and gapless topological materials and their\nclassification in terms of nonspatial symmetries, such as time-reversal, as\nwell as spatial symmetries, such as reflection. Furthermore, we survey the\nclassification of gapless modes localized on topological defects. The\nclassification of these systems is discussed by use of homotopy groups,\nClifford algebras, K-theory, and non-linear sigma models describing the\nAnderson (de-)localization at the surface or inside a defect of the material.\nTheoretical model systems and their topological invariants are reviewed\ntogether with recent experimental results in order to provide a unified and\ncomprehensive perspective of the field. While the bulk of this article is\nconcerned with the topological properties of noninteracting or mean-field\nHamiltonians, we also provide a brief overview of recent results and open\nquestions concerning the topological classifications of interacting systems.\n", "  A scale-invariant extension of the Standard Model with a singlet-scalar and\nhidden-QCD sector is studied. The scale of electroweak symmetry breaking is\ngenerated dynamically in an asymptotic-free hidden-QCD sector, and mediated by\nthe Higgs-singlet coupling. Hidden-QCD pions are stable and can be a candidate\nof the cold dark matter. This presentation is based on a collaboration with D.\nW. Jung and P. Ko.\n", "  We reexamine generation of the primordial magnetic fields, at temperature\n$T>80$TeV, by applying a consistent kinetic theory framework which is suitably\nmodified to take the quantum anomaly into account. The modified kinetic\nequation can reproduce the known quantum field theoretic results upto the\nleading orders. We show that our results qualitatively matches with the earlier\nresults obtained using heuristic arguments. The modified kinetic theory can\ngive the instabilities responsible for generation of the magnetic field due to\nchiral imbalance in two distinct regimes: a) when the collisions play a\ndominant role and b) when the primordial plasma can be regarded as\ncollisionless. We argue that the instability developing in the collisional\nregime can dominate over the instability in the collisionless regime.\n", "  Theoretical Raman line shape functions have been studied to take care of\nquantum confinement effect and Fano effect individually and jointly. The\ncharacteristics of various Raman line shapes have been studied in terms of the\nbroadening and asymmetry of Raman line shapes. It is shown that the asymmetry\nin the Raman line-shape function caused by these two effects individually does\nnot add linearly to give asymmetry of line-shape generated by considering the\ncombined effect. This indicates existence of interplay between the two effects.\nThe origin of interplay lies in the fact that Fano effect itself depends on\nquantum confinement effect and in turn provides an asymmetry. This can not be\nexplained by considering the two effects contribution independent of each\nother.\n", "  We present a detailed quantitative description of the recently proposed\n\"slingshot effect\" [Fiore, Fedele, De angelis 2014]. Namely, we determine a\nbroad range of conditions under which the impact of a very short and intense\nlaser pulse normally onto a low-density plasma (or matter to be locally\ncompletely ionized into a plasma by the pulse) causes the expulsion of a bunch\nof surface electrons in the direction opposite to the one of propagation of the\npulse, and the detailed, ready-for-experiments features of the expelled\nelectrons (energy spectrum, collimation, etc). The effect is due to the\ncombined actions of the ponderomotive force and the huge longitudinal field\narising from charge separation. Our predictions are based on estimating 3D\ncorrections to a simple, yet powerful plane magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model\nwhere the equations to be solved are reduced to a system of Hamilton equations\nin one dimension (or a collection of) which become autonomous after the pulse\nhas overcome the electrons. Experimental tests seem to be at hand. If confirmed\nby the latter, the effect would provide a new extraction and acceleration\nmechanism for electrons, alternative to traditional radio-frequency-based or\nLaser-Wake-Field ones.\n", "  We compute the form factors for the $B \\to Kl^+l^-$ semileptonic decay\nprocess in lattice QCD using gauge-field ensembles with 2+1 flavors of sea\nquark, generated by the MILC Collaboration. The ensembles span lattice spacings\nfrom 0.12 to 0.045 fm and have multiple sea-quark masses to help control the\nchiral extrapolation. The asqtad improved staggered action is used for the\nlight valence and sea quarks, and the clover action with the Fermilab\ninterpretation is used for the heavy $b$ quark. We present results for the form\nfactors $f_+(q^2)$, $f_0(q^2)$, and $f_T(q^2)$, where $q^2$ is the momentum\ntransfer, together with a comprehensive examination of systematic errors.\nLattice QCD determines the form factors for a limited range of $q^2$, and we\nuse the model-independent $z$ expansion to cover the whole kinematically\nallowed range. We present our final form-factor results as coefficients of the\n$z$ expansion and the correlations between them, where the errors on the\ncoefficients include statistical and all systematic uncertainties. We use this\ncomplete description of the form factors to test QCD predictions of the form\nfactors at high and low $q^2$. We also compare a Standard-Model calculation of\nthe branching ratio for $B \\to Kl^+l^-$ with experimental data.\n", "  In this article we extend a recent theorem proven by Hod (Phys. Lett. B, {\\bf\n727}, 345--348, 2013) to $n$-dimensional Einstein and Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet\ntheories, which gives an upper bound for the photon sphere radii of spherically\nsymmetric black holes. As applications of these results we give a universal\nupper bound for the real part of quasinormal modes in the WKB limit and a\nuniversal lower bound for the position of the first relativistic image in the\nstrong lensing regime produced by these type of black holes. For the\naxially-symmetric case, we also make some general comments (independent of the\nunderlying gravitational theory) on the relation between circular null\ngeodesics and the fastest way to circle a black hole.\n", "  Quantities invariant under local unitary transformations are of natural\ninterest in the study of entanglement. This paper deduces and studies a\nparticularly simple quantity that is constructed from a combination of two\nstandard permutations of the density matrix, namely realignment and partial\ntranspose. This bipartite quantity, denoted here as $R_{12}$, vanishes on large\nclasses of separable states including classical-quantum correlated states,\nwhile being maximum for only maximally entangled states. It is shown to be\nnaturally related to the 3-tangle in three qubit states via their two-qubit\nreduced density matrices. Upper and lower bounds on concurrence and negativity\nof two-qubit density matrices for all ranks are given in terms of $R_{12}$.\nAnsatz states satisfying these bounds are given and verified using various\nnumerical methods. In rank-2 case it is shown that the states satisfying the\nlower bound on $R_{12}$ {\\it vs} concurrence define a class of three qubit\nstates that maximizes the tripartite entanglement (the 3-tangle) given an\namount of entanglement between a pair of them. The measure $R_{12}$ is\nconjectured, via numerical sampling, to be always larger than the concurrence\nand negativity. In particular this is shown to be true for the physically\ninteresting case of $X$ states.\n", "  We study a bilayer Ising spin system consisting of antiferromagnetic (AF) and\nferromagnetic (FM) triangular planes, coupled by ferromagnetic exchange\ninteraction, by standard Monte Carlo and parallel tempering methods. The AF/FM\nbilayer is found to display the critical behavior completely different from\nboth the single FM and AF constituents as well as the FM/FM and AF/AF bilayers.\nNamely, by finite-size scaling (FSS) analysis we identify at the same\ntemperature a standard Ising transition from the paramagnetic to FM state in\nthe FM plane that induces a ferrimagnetic state with a finite net magnetic\nmoment in the AF plane. At lower temperatures there is another phase\ntransition, that takes place only in the AF plane, to different ferrimagnetic\nstate with spins on two sublattices pointing parallel and on one sublattice\nantiparallel to the spins on the FM plane. FSS indicates that the corresponding\ncritical exponents are close to the two-dimensional three-state ferromagnetic\nPotts model values.\n", "  Recently developed techniques allow for simultaneous measurements of the\npositions of all ultra cold atoms in a trap with high resolution. Each such\nsingle shot experiment detects one element of the quantum ensemble formed by\nthe cloud of atoms. Repeated single shot measurements can be used to determine\nall correlations between particle positions as opposed to standard measurements\nthat determine particle density or two-particle correlations only. In this\npaper we discuss the possible outcomes of such single shot measurements in case\nof cloud of ultra-cold non-interacting Fermi atoms. We show that the Pauli\nexclusion principle alone leads to correlations between particle positions that\noriginate from unexpected spatial structures formed by the atoms.\n", "  There are many methods proposed for inferring parameters of the Ising model\nfrom given data, that is a set of configurations generated according to the\nmodel itself. However little attention has been paid until now to the data,\ne.g. how the data is generated, whether the inference error using one set of\ndata could be smaller than using another set of data, etc. In this paper we\naddress the data quality problem in the kinetic inverse Ising problem. We\nquantify the quality of data using effective rank of the correlation matrix,\nand show that data gathered in a out of-equilibrium regime has a better quality\nthan data gathered in equilibrium for coupling reconstruction. We also propose\na matrix-perturbation based method for tuning the quality of given data and for\nremoving bad-quality (i.e. redundant) configurations from data.\n", "  Microtubule structure and functions have been widely studied in vitro and in\ncells. Research has shown that cysteines on tubulin play a crucial role in the\npolymerization of microtubules. Here, we show that blocking sulfhydryl groups\nof cysteines in taxol-stabilized polymerized microtubules with a commonly used\nchemical crosslinker prevents temporal end-to-end annealing of microtubules in\nvitro. This can dramatically affect the length distribution of the\nmicrotubules. The crosslinker sulfosuccinimidyl\n4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxylate, sulfo-SMCC, consists of a\nmaleimide and an N-hydroxysuccinimide ester group to bind to sulfhydryl groups\nand primary amines, respectively. Interestingly, addition of a maleimide dye\nalone does not show the same interference with annealing in stabilized\nmicrotubules. This study shows that the sulfhydryl groups of cysteines of\ntubulin that are vital for the polymerization are also important for the\nsubsequent annealing of microtubules.\n", "  Spherical vacuum and scalar collapse for the Starobinsky R^2 model is\nsimulated. Obtained by considering the quantum-gravitational effects, this\nmodel would admit some cases of singularity-free cosmological spacetimes. It is\nfound, however, that in vacuum and scalar collapse, when f' or the physical\nscalar field is strong enough, a black hole including a central singularity can\nbe formed. In addition, near the central singularity, gravity dominates the\nrepulsion from the potential, so that in some circumstances the Ricci scalar is\npushed to infinity by gravity. Therefore, the semiclassical effects as included\nhere do not avoid the singularity problem in general relativity. A strong\nphysical scalar field can prevent the Ricci scalar from growing to infinity.\nVacuum collapse for the RlnR model is explored, and it is observed that for\nthis model the Ricci scalar can also go to infinity as the central singularity\nis approached. Therefore, this feature seems universal in vacuum and scalar\ncollapse in f(R) gravity.\n", "  We present a general error-correcting scheme for quantum annealing that\nallows for the encoding of a logical qubit into an arbitrarily large number of\nphysical qubits. Given any Ising model optimization problem, the encoding\nreplaces each logical qubit by a complete graph of degree $C$, representing the\ndistance of the error-correcting code. A subsequent minor-embedding step then\nimplements the encoding on the underlying hardware graph of the quantum\nannealer. We demonstrate experimentally that the performance of a D-Wave Two\nquantum annealing device improves as $C$ grows. We show that the performance\nimprovement can be interpreted as arising from an effective increase in the\nenergy scale of the problem Hamiltonian, or equivalently, an effective\nreduction in the temperature at which the device operates. The number $C$ thus\nallows us to control the amount of protection against thermal and control\nerrors, and in particular, to trade qubits for a lower effective temperature\nthat scales as $C^{-\\eta}$, with $\\eta \\leq 2$. This effective temperature\nreduction is an important step towards scalable quantum annealing.\n", "  We study the quark hadron phase transition in the framework of massive\ngravity. We show that the modification of the FRW cosmological equations leads\nto the quark hadron phase transition in the early massive Universe. Using\nnumerical analysis, we consider that a phase transition based on the chiral\nsymmetry breaking after the electroweak transition, occurred at approximately\n$10 \\mu$ seconds after the Big Bang to convert a plasma of free quarks and\ngluons into hadrons.\n", "  Clustering of like-sign vortices in a planar bounded domain is known to occur\nat negative temperature, a phenomenon that Onsager demonstrated to be a\nconsequence of bounded phase space. In a confined superfluid, quantized\nvortices can support such an ordered phase, provided they evolve as an almost\nisolated subsystem containing sufficient energy. A detailed theoretical\nunderstanding of the statistical mechanics of such states thus requires a\nmicrocanonical approach. Here we develop an analytical theory of the vortex\nclustering transition in a neutral system of quantum vortices confined to a\ntwo-dimensional disk geometry, within the microcanonical ensemble. As the\nsystem energy increases above a critical value, the system develops global\norder via the emergence of a macroscopic dipole structure from the homogeneous\nphase of vortices, spontaneously breaking the Z2 symmetry associated with\ninvariance under vortex circulation exchange, and the rotational SO(2) symmetry\ndue to the disk geometry. The dipole structure emerges characterized by the\ncontinuous growth of the macroscopic dipole moment which serves as a global\norder parameter, resembling a continuous phase transition. The critical\ntemperature of the transition, and the critical exponent associated with the\ndipole moment, are obtained exactly within mean-field theory. The clustering\ntransition is shown to be distinct from the final state reached at high energy,\nknown as supercondensation. The dipole moment develops via two macroscopic\nvortex clusters and the cluster locations are found analytically, both near the\nclustering transition and in the supercondensation limit. The microcanonical\ntheory shows excellent agreement with Monte Carlo simulations, and signatures\nof the transition are apparent even for a modest system of 100 vortices,\naccessible in current Bose-Einstein condensate experiments.\n", "  The ATLAS and CMS experiments at the LHC have reported an excess of diphoton\nevents with invariant mass around 750 GeV, with local significance of about\n$3.6 \\sigma$ and $2.6 \\sigma$, respectively. We entertain the possibility that\nthis excess is due to new physics, in which case the data suggest a new\nparticle with 13 TeV LHC production cross section times diphoton branching\nratio of about 5~fb. Interestingly, ATLAS reports a mild preference for a\nsizeable width for the signal of about 45 GeV; this result appears consistent\nwith CMS, and is further supported by improving the compatibility of the 8 TeV\nand 13 TeV analyses. We focus on the possibility that the new state is a\nscalar. First, we show that, in addition to the new state that is needed\ndirectly to produce the diphoton bump, yet more new particles beyond the\nStandard Model are needed to induce diphoton decay rate of the right size.\nSecond, we note that if the excess is attributed to the Breit-Wigner peak of a\nsingle new state, then the signal strength and width -- taken together --\nsuggest a total LHC production cross section of order $10^5$ fb. Restricting to\nperturbative models without ad-hoc introduction of many new states or exotic\ncharges, we reach the following conclusions: (i) Gluon-fusion cannot explain\nthe required large production cross section. (ii) Tree level production from\ninitial state quarks cannot explain the required branching ratio to two\nphotons. (iii) Tree level production is constrained by flavor data as well as\nLHC Run-I and Tevatron dijet analyses. Insisting on a large width we are led to\nsuggest that more than one scalar states, nearly degenerate in mass, could\nconspire to produce an observed wide bump.\n", "  The relativistic problem of spin- fermions subject to vector hyperbolic\n(kink-like) potential tanh (kx) is investigated by using the parametric\nNikiforov-Uvarov method. The energy eigenvalue equation and the corresponding\nnormalized wave functions are obtained in terms of the Jacobi polynomials for\nx>0 and x<0 cases.\n", "  We study optical conductivity of a two-dimensional electron gas with\nanisotropic $k$-cubic Rashba spin-orbit interaction formed at the\nLaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ interface. The anisotropic spin splitting energy gives rise\nto different features of the optical conductivity in comparison to the\nisotropic $k$-cubic Rashba spin-orbit interaction. For large carrier density\nand strong spin-orbit couplings, the density dependence of Drude weight\ndeviates from the linear behavior. The charge and optical conductivities remain\nisotropic despite anisotropic nature of the Fermi contours. An infinitesimally\nsmall photon energy would suffice to initiate inter-band optical transitions\ndue to degeneracy along certain directions in momentum space. The optical\nconductivity shows a single peak at a given photon energy depending on the\nsystem parameters and then falls off to zero at higher photon energy. These\nfeatures are lacking for systems with isotropic $k$-cubic Rashba spin-orbit\ncoupling. These striking features can be used to extract the information about\nnature of the spin-orbit interaction experimentally and illuminate some light\non the orbital origin of the two-dimensional electron gas.\n", "  Why did the emergence of our species require a timescale similar to the\nentire habitable period of our planet? Our late appearance has previously been\ninterpreted by Carter (2008) as evidence that observers typically require a\nvery long development time, implying that intelligent life is a rare\noccurrence. Here we present an alternative explanation, which simply asserts\nthat many planets possess brief periods of habitability. We also propose that\nthe rate-limiting step for the formation of observers is the enlargement of\nspecies from an initially microbial state. In this scenario the development of\nintelligent life is a slow but almost inevitable process, greatly enhancing the\nprospects of future SETI experiments such as the Breakthrough Listen project.\n", "  Porosification of silicon (Si) by metal induced etching (MIE) process have\nbeen studies here to understand the etching mechanism. The etching mechanism\nhas been discussed on the basis of electron transfer from Si to metal ion\n(Ag$^+$) and metal to H$_2$O$_2$. Role of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) in the\netching process has been investigated by studying the effect of AgNPs coverage\non surface porosity. A quantitative analysis of SEM images, done using Image J,\nshows a direct correlation between AgNPs coverage and surface porosity after\nthe porosification. Density of Si nanowires (NWs) also varies as a function of\nAgNPs fractional coverage which reasserts the fact that AgNPs governs the\nporosification process during MIE.\n", "  We study the dynamical response of ultracold fermion-boson mixture in the\nBogoliubov regime, where the interactions between fermionic impurities and\nbosonic excitations (phonons) are described by an effective Frohlich model\nunder the Bogoliubov approximation. A characteristic suppression of the\nsingle-particle spectral weight is found in the small momentum region where the\nimpurity band and phonon mode intersect. Using diagrammatic technique we\ncompute the Bragg spectra as well as the momentum dependent force-force\ncorrelation function. We fnd that both of them are heavily affected by the\nspectral weight suppression effect at low impurity densities in both 1D and 2D\nsystems. We show that the the spectral weight suppression feature in Bragg\nspectra, which was previously found in the quantum Monte Carlo simulations and\nwhich cannot be recovered by the random phase approximation, can be accurately\nreproduced with the help of vertex corrections.\n", "  Despite their appealing features, models with gauge-mediated supersymmetry\nbreaking (GMSB) typically present a high degree of fine-tuning, due to the\ninitial absence of the top trilinear scalar couplings, $A_t=0$. In this paper,\nwe carefully evaluate such a tuning, showing that is worse than per mil in the\nminimal model. Then, we examine some existing proposals to generate $A_t\\neq 0$\nterm in this context. We find that, although the stops can be made lighter,\nusually the tuning does not improve (it may be even worse), with some\nexceptions, which involve the generation of $A_t$ at one loop or tree level. We\nexamine both possibilities and propose a conceptually simplified version of the\nlatter; which is arguably the optimum GMSB setup (with minimal matter content),\nconcerning the fine-tuning issue. The resulting fine-tuning is better than one\nper mil, still severe but similar to other minimal supersymmetric standard\nmodel constructions. We also explore the so-called \"little $A_t^2/m^2$\nproblem\", i.e. the fact that a large $A_t$-term is normally accompanied by a\nsimilar or larger sfermion mass, which typically implies an increase in the\nfine-tuning. Finally, we find the version of GMSB for which this ratio is\noptimized, which, nevertheless, does not minimize the fine-tuning.\n", "  Multiplex networks are generalized network structures that are able to\ndescribe networks in which the same set of nodes are connected by links that\nhave different connotations. Multiplex networks are ubiquitous since they\ndescribe social, financial, engineering and biological networks as well.\nExtending our ability to analyze complex networks to multiplex network\nstructures increases greatly the level of information that is possible to\nextract from Big Data. For these reasons characterizing the centrality of nodes\nin multiplex networks and finding new ways to solve challenging inference\nproblems defined on multiplex networks are fundamental questions of network\nscience. In this paper we discuss the relevance of the Multiplex PageRank\nalgorithm for measuring the centrality of nodes in multilayer networks and we\ncharacterize the utility of the recently introduced indicator function\n$\\widetilde{\\Theta}^{S}$ for describing their mesoscale organization and\ncommunity structure. As working examples for studying these measures we\nconsider three multiplex network datasets coming for social science.\n", "  Many-body entanglement is at the heart of the Kondo effect, which has its\nhallmark in quantum dots as a zero-bias conductance peak at low temperatures.\nIt signals the emergence of a conducting singlet state formed by a localized\ndot degree of freedom and conduction electrons. Carbon nanotubes offer the\npossibility to study the emergence of the Kondo entanglement by tuning\nmany-body correlations with a gate voltage. Here we quantitatively show an\nundiscovered side of\n  Kondo correlations, which counterintuitively tend to block conduction\nchannels: inelastic cotunneling lines in the magnetospectrum of a carbon\nnanotube strikingly disappear when tuning the gate voltage. Considering the\nglobal \\SUT\\ $\\otimes $ \\SUT\\ symmetry of a carbon nanotube coupled to leads,\nwe find that only resonances involving flips of the Kramers pseudospins,\nassociated to this symmetry, are observed at temperatures and voltages below\nthe corresponding Kondo scale. Our results demonstrate the robust formation of\nentangled many-body states with no net pseudospin.\n", "  We reach the robust conclusion that, by combining the observed cosmic rays of\nr-process elements with the fact that the velocity of the neutron-star-merger\nejecta is much higher than that of the supernova ejecta, either (1) the reverse\nshock in the neutron-star-merger ejecta is a very inefficient accelerator that\nconverts less than 0.003% of the ejecta kinetic energy to the cosmic-ray energy\nor (2) the neutron star merger is not the origin of the Galactic r-process\nelements. We also find that the acceleration efficiency should be less than\n0.1% for the reverse shock of the supernova ejecta with the observed cosmic\nrays lighter than the iron.\n", "  We study the simplifications occurring in any likelihood function in the\npresence of a large number of small systematic uncertainties. We find that the\nmarginalisation of these uncertainties can be done analytically by means of\nsecond-order error propagation, error combination, the Lyapunov central limit\ntheorem, and under mild approximations which are typically satisfied for LHC\nlikelihoods. The outcomes of this analysis are i) a very light treatment of\nsystematic uncertainties ii) a convenient way of reporting the main effects of\nsystematic uncertainties such as the detector effects occuring in LHC\nmeasurements.\n", "  The concept of entropy is fundamental to thermalization, yet appears at odds\nwith basic principles in quantum mechanics. Statistical mechanics relies on the\nmaximization of entropy for a system at thermal equilibrium. However, an\nisolated many-body system initialized in a pure state will remain pure during\nSchr\\\"{o}dinger evolution, and in this sense has static, zero entropy. The\nunderlying role of quantum mechanics in many-body physics is then seemingly\nantithetical to the success of statistical mechanics in a large variety of\nsystems. Here we experimentally study the emergence of statistical mechanics in\na quantum state, and observe the fundamental role of quantum entanglement in\nfacilitating this emergence. We perform microscopy on an evolving quantum\nsystem, and we see thermalization occur on a local scale, while we measure that\nthe full quantum state remains pure. We directly measure entanglement entropy\nand observe how it assumes the role of the thermal entropy in thermalization.\nAlthough the full state remains measurably pure, entanglement creates local\nentropy that validates the use of statistical physics for local observables. In\ncombination with number-resolved, single-site imaging, we demonstrate how our\nmeasurements of a pure quantum state agree with the Eigenstate Thermalization\nHypothesis and thermal ensembles in the presence of a near-volume law in the\nentanglement entropy.\n", "  The thermal conductivity of the iron-based superconductor FeSe was measured\nat temperatures down to 50 mK in magnetic fields up to 17 T. In zero magnetic\nfield, the electronic residual linear term in the T = 0 limit, \\kappa_0/T, is\nvanishingly small. Application of a magnetic field H causes no increase in\n\\kappa_0/T initially. Those two observations show that there are no zero-energy\nquasiparticles that carry heat and therefore no nodes in the superconducting\ngap of FeSe. The full field dependence of \\kappa_0/T has the classic shape of a\ntwo-band superconductor, such as MgB2: it rises exponentially at very low\nfield, with a characteristic field H* << Hc2, and then more slowly up to the\nupper critical field Hc2. This shows that the superconducting gap is very small\non one of the pockets in the Fermi surface of FeSe.\n", "  Inflaton coupling to a vector field via the $f^2(\\phi)F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu}$\nterm is used in several contexts in the literature, such as to generate\nprimordial magnetic fields, to produce statistically anisotropic curvature\nperturbation, to support anisotropic inflation and to circumvent the\n$\\eta$-problem. Here, I perform dynamical analysis of such a system allowing\nfor most general Bianchi I initial conditions. I also confirm the stability of\nattractor equilibrium points in phase-space directions that had not been\ninvestigated before.\n", "  There exists a vast literature examining the electroweak (EW) fine-tuning\nproblem in supersymmetric scenarios, but little concerned with the dark matter\n(DM) one, which should be combined with the former. In this paper, we study\nthis problem in an, as much as possible, exhaustive and rigorous way. We have\nconsidered the MSSM framework, assuming that the LSP is the lightest\nneutralino, $\\chi_1^0$, and exploring the various possibilities for the mass\nand composition of $\\chi_1^0$, as well as different mechanisms for annihilation\nof the DM particles in the early Universe (well-tempered neutralinos, funnels\nand co-annihilation scenarios). We also present a discussion about the\nstatistical meaning of the fine-tuning and how it should be computed for the DM\nabundance, and combined with the EW fine-tuning. The results are very robust\nand model-independent and favour some scenarios (like the h-funnel when\n$M_{\\chi_1^0}$ is not too close to $m_h/2$) with respect to others (such as the\npure wino case). These features should be taken into account when one explores\n\"natural SUSY\" scenarios and their possible signatures at the LHC and in DM\ndetection experiments.\n", "  We introduce the concept of a {\\it reflection quasilattice}, the\nquasiperiodic generalization of a Bravais lattice with irreducible reflection\nsymmetry. Among their applications, reflection quasilattices are the reciprocal\n(i.e. Bragg diffraction) lattices for quasicrystals and quasicrystal tilings,\nsuch as Penrose tilings, with irreducible reflection symmetry and discrete\nscale invariance. In a follow-up paper, we will show that reflection\nquasilattices can be used to generate tilings in real space with properties\nanalogous to those in Penrose tilings, but with different symmetries and in\nvarious dimensions. Here we explain that reflection quasilattices only exist in\ndimensions two, three and four, and we prove that there is a unique reflection\nquasilattice in dimension four: the \"maximal reflection quasilattice\" in terms\nof dimensionality and symmetry. Unlike crystallographic Bravais lattices, all\nreflection quasilattices are invariant under rescaling by certain discrete\nscale factors. We tabulate the complete set of scale factors for all reflection\nquasilattices in dimension $d>2$, and for all those with quadratic irrational\nscale factors in $d=2$.\n", "  We study, experimentally and theoretically, the mechanical response of sheet\nmaterials on which line cracks or cuts are arranged in a simple pattern. Such\nsheet materials, often called kirigami (the Japanese words, kiri and gami,\nstand for cut and paper, respectively), demonstrate a unique mechanical\nresponse promising for various engineering applications such as stretchable\nbatteries: kirigami sheets possess a mechanical regime in which sheets are\nhighly stretchable and very soft compared with the original sheets without line\ncracks, by virtue of out-of-plane deformation. However, this regime starts\nafter a transition from an initial stiff regime governed by in-plane\ndeformation. In other words, the softness of the kirigami structure emerges as\na result of a transition from the two-dimensional to three-dimensional\ndeformation, i.e., from stretching to bending. We clarify the physical origins\nof the transition and mechanical regimes, which are revealed to be governed by\nsimple scaling laws. The results could be useful for controlling and designing\nthe mechanical response of sheet materials including cell sheets for medical\nregeneration and relevant to the development of materials with tunable\nstiffness and mechanical force sensors.\n", "  The hourglass is one of the apparatuses familiar to everyone, but reveals\nintriguing behaviors peculiar to granular materials, and many issues are\nremained to be explored. In this study, we examined the dynamics of falling\nsand in a special form of hourglass, i.e., a wedge-shaped hopper, when a\nsuspended granular layer is stabilized to a certain degree. As a result, we\nfound remarkably different dynamic regimes of bubbling and cavity. In the\nbubbling regime, bubbles of nearly equal size are created in the sand at a\nregular time interval. In the cavity regime, a cavity grows as sand beads fall\nbefore a sudden collapse of the cavity. Bubbling found here is quite visible to\na level never discussed in the physics literature and the cavity regime is a\nnovel phase, which is neither continuous, intermittent nor completely blocked\nphase. We elucidate the physical conditions necessary for the bubbling and\ncavity regimes and develop simple theories for the regimes to successfully\nexplain the observed phenomena by considering the stability of a suspended\ngranular layer and clogging of granular flow at the outlet of the hopper. The\nbubbling and cavity regimes could be useful for mixing a fluid with granular\nmaterials.\n", "  A self-contained derivation of the formalism describing Weyl, Majorana and\nDirac fields from a unified perspective is given based on a concise description\nof the representation theory of the proper orthochronous Lorentz group.\nLagrangian methods play no role in the present exposition, which covers several\nfundamental aspects of relativistic field theory which are commonly not\nincluded in introductory courses when treating fermionic fields via the Dirac\nequation in the first place.\n", "  We study the thermalization and the Bose-Einstein condensation of a paraxial,\nspectrally narrow beam of quantum light propagating in a lossless bulk Kerr\nmedium. The spatiotemporal evolution of the quantum optical field is ruled by a\nHeisenberg equation analogous to the quantum nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation\nof dilute atomic Bose gases. Correspondingly, in the weak-nonlinearity regime,\nthe phase-space density evolves according to the Boltzmann equation.\nExpressions for the thermalization time and for the temperature and the\nchemical potential of the eventual Bose-Einstein distribution are found. After\ndiscussing experimental issues, we introduce an optical setup allowing the\nevaporative cooling of a guided beam of light towards Bose-Einstein\ncondensation. This might serve as a novel source of coherent light.\n", "  Time-reversal invariant topological superconductors are characterized by the\npresence of Majorana Kramers pairs localized at defects. One of the transport\nsignatures of Majorana Kramers pairs is the quantized differential conductance\nof $4e^2/h$ when such a one-dimensional superconductor is coupled to a\nnormal-metal lead. The resonant Andreev reflection, responsible for this\nphenomenon, can be understood as the boundary condition change for lead\nelectrons at low energies. In this paper, we study the stability of the Andreev\nreflection fixed point with respect to electron-electron interactions in the\nLuttinger liquid. We first calculate the phase diagram for the Luttinger\nliquid-Majorana Kramers pair junction and show that its low-energy properties\nare determined by Andreev reflection scattering processes in the spin-triplet\nchannel, i.e. the corresponding Andreev boundary conditions are similar to that\nin a spin-triplet superconductor - normal lead junction. We also study here a\nquantum dot coupled to a normal lead and a Majorana Kramers pair and\ninvestigate the effect of local repulsive interactions leading to an interplay\nbetween Kondo and Majorana correlations. Using a combination of renormalization\ngroup analysis and slave-boson mean-field theory, we show that the system flows\nto a new fixed point which is controlled by the Majorana interaction rather\nthan the Kondo coupling. This Majorana fixed point is characterized by\ncorrelations between the localized spin and the fermion parity of each spin\nsector of the topological superconductor. We investigate the stability of the\nMajorana phase with respect to Gaussian fluctuations.\n", "  We show that if a cosmic string exists, it may be identified through\ncharacteristic diffraction pattern in the energy spectrum of the observed\nsignal. In particular, if the string is on the line of sight, the wave field is\nshown to fit the Cornu spiral. We suggest a simple procedure, based on Keller's\ngeometrical theory of diffraction, which allows to explain wave effects in\nconical spacetime of a cosmic string in terms of interference of four\ncharacteristic rays. Our results are supposed to be valid for scalar massless\nwaves, including gravitational waves, electromagnetic waves, or even sound in\ncase of condensed matter systems with analogous topological defects.\n", "  In this paper we perform a dynamical analysis for a vector field as a\ncandidate for the dark energy, in the presence of a barothropic fluid. The\nvector is one component of the so-called cosmic triad, which is a set of three\nidentical copies of an abelian field pointing mutually in orthogonal\ndirections. In order to generalize the analysis, we also assumed the\ninteraction between dark energy and the barotropic fluid, with a\nphenomenological coupling. Both matter and dark energy eras can be successfully\ndescribed by the critical points, indicating that the dynamical system theory\nis a viable tool to analyze asymptotic states of such cosmological models.\n", "  Quantum computation strongly relies on the realisation, manipulation and\ncontrol of qubits. A central method for realizing qubits is by creating a\ndouble-well potential system with a significant gap between the first two\neigenvalues and the rest. In this work we first revisit the theoretical grounds\nunderlying the double-well qubit dynamics, then proceed to suggest novel\nextensions of these principles to a triple-well qutrit with periodic boundary\nconditions, followed by a general d-well analysis of qudits. These analyses are\nbased on representations of the special unitary groups SU(d) which expose the\nsystems' symmetry and employ them for performing computations. We conclude with\na few notes on coherence and scalability of d-well systems.\n", "  We propose a simple model accommodating the reported 750 GeV diphoton excess\nseen in the first 13-TeV run of the LHC. It leads to testable predictions, in\nparticular for di-lepton production, at higher integrated luminosity. We append\nto the minimal standard model a new gauge sector with its own SU(2) symmetry\ngroup. A new complex doublet scalar field provides mass for the new vectors and\ndescribes the 750-GeV resonance. An adequate rate for the diphoton signals,\nwith resonant production via photon fusion, requires the VEV of the new scalar\nfield to be somewhat less than the electroweak scale. This in turn requires the\nnew heavy vectors to have sub-TeV masses and be relatively strongly coupled. A\nnew global U(1) symmetry plays a key role. Current precision-electroweak\nconstraints are respected.\n", "  Variable-range hopping conductivity has long been understood in terms of a\ncanonical prescription for relating the single-particle density of states to\nthe temperature-dependent conductivity. Here we demonstrate that this\nprescription breaks down in situations where a large and long-ranged random\npotential develops. In particular, we examine a canonical model of a completely\ncompensated semiconductor, and we show that at low temperatures hopping\nproceeds along self-organized, low-dimensional subspaces having fractal\ndimension $d = 2$. We derive and study numerically the spatial structure of\nthese subspaces, as well as the conductivity and density of states that result\nfrom them. One of our prominent findings is that fractal ordering of low energy\nsites greatly enhances the hopping conductivity, and allows Efros-Shklovskii\ntype conductivity to persist up to unexpectedly high temperatures.\n", "  Ultrafast spectroscopies constitute a fundamental tool to investigate the\ndynamics of non-equilibrium many-body states in correlated materials.\nTwo-pulses (pump-probe) experiments have shed new light on the interplay\nbetween high-energy electronic excitations and the emerging low-energy\nproperties, such as superconductivity and charge-order, in many interesting\nmaterials. Here we will review some recent results on copper oxides and we will\npropose the use of high-resolution multi-dimensional techniques to investigate\nthe decoherence processes of optical excitations in these systems. This novel\npiece of information is expected to open a new route toward the understanding\nof the fundamental interactions that lead to the exotic electronic and magnetic\nproperties of correlated materials.\n", "  We extend our previous study of supersymmetric Higgs inflation in the context\nof no-scale supergravity and grand unification, to include models based on the\nflipped SU(5) and the Pati-Salam group. Like the previous SU(5) GUT model,\nthese yield a class of inflation models whose inflation predictions interpolate\nbetween those of the quadratic chaotic inflation and Starobinsky-like\ninflation, while avoiding tension with proton decay limits. We further analyse\nthe reheating process in these models, and derive the number of e-folds, which\nis independent of the reheating temperature. We derive the corresponding\npredictions for the scalar tilt and the tensor-to-scalar ratio in cosmic\nmicrowave background perturbations, as well as discussing the gravitino\nproduction following inflation.\n", "  A type-II superconductor survives in an external magnetic field by admitting\nan Abrikosov lattice of quantized vortices. This is an imprint of the\nAharonov-Bohm effect created by the Abelian U(1) gauge field. The simplest\nnon-Abelian analogue of such a gauge field, which belongs to the SU(2) symmetry\ngroup, can be found in topological insulators. Here we discover a\nsuperconducting ground state with a lattice of SU(2) vortices in a simple\ntwo-dimensional model that presents an SU(2) \"magnetic\" field (invariant under\ntime-reversal) to attractively interacting fermions. The model directly\ncaptures the correlated topological insulator quantum well, and approximates\none channel for instabilities on the Kondo topological insulator surface. Due\nto its simplicity, the model might become amenable to cold atom simulations in\nthe foreseeable future. The vitality of low-energy vortex states born out of\nSU(2) \"magnetic\" fields is promising for the creation of incompressible vortex\nliquids with non-Abelian fractional excitations.\n", "  We study the nucleation of crystalline cluster phases in the generalized\nexponential model with exponent n=4. Due to the finite value of this pair\npotential for zero separation, at high densities the system forms cluster\ncrystals with multiply occupied lattice sites. Here, we investigate the\nmicroscopic mechanisms that lead to the formation of cluster crystals from a\nsupercooled liquid in the low-temperature region of the phase diagram. Using\nmolecular dynamics and umbrella sampling, we calculate the free energy as a\nfunction of the size of the largest crystalline nucleus in the system, and\ncompare our results with predictions from classical nucleation theory.\nEmploying bond-order parameters based on a Voronoi tessellation to distinguish\ndifferent crystal structures, we analyze the average composition of crystalline\nnuclei. We find that even for conditions where a multiply-occupied fcc crystal\nis the thermodynamically stable phase, the nucleation into bcc cluster crystals\nis strongly preferred. Furthermore, we study the particle mobility in the\nsupercooled liquid and in the cluster crystal. In the cluster crystal, the\nmotion of individual particles is captured by a simple reaction-diffusion model\nintroduced previously to model the kinetics of hydrogen bonds.\n", "  In these notes we review the S-matrix theory in (1+1)-dimensional integrable\nmodels, focusing mainly on the relativistic case. Once the main definitions and\nphysical properties are introduced, we discuss the factorization of scattering\nprocesses due to integrability. We then focus on the analytic properties of the\ntwo-particle scattering amplitude and illustrate the derivation of the\nS-matrices for all the possible bound states using the so-called bootstrap\nprinciple. General algebraic structures underlying the S-matrix theory and its\nrelation with the form factors axioms are briefly mentioned. Finally, we\ndiscuss the S-matrices of sine-Gordon and SU(2), SU(3) chiral Gross-Neveu\nmodels. This is part of a collection of lecture notes for the Young Researchers\nIntegrability School, organized by the GATIS network at Durham University on\n6-10 July 2015.\n", "  The influence of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) on the physical properties of the\n5d2 system Sr2MgOsO6 is probed via a combination of magnetometry, specific heat\nmeasurements, elastic and inelastic neutron scattering, and density functional\ntheory calculations. Although a significant degree of frustration is expected,\nwe find that Sr2MgOsO6 orders in a type I antiferromagnetic structure at the\nremarkably high temperature of 108 K. The measurements presented allow for the\nfirst accurate quantification of the size of the magnetic moment in a 5d2\nsystem of 0.60(2) muB - a significantly reduced moment from the expected value\nfor such a system. Furthermore, significant anisotropy is identified via a spin\nexcitation gap, and we confirm by first principles calculations that SOC not\nonly provides the magnetocrystalline anisotropy, but also plays a crucial role\nin determining both the ground state magnetic order and the size of the local\nmoment in this compound. Through comparison to Sr2ScOsO6, it is demonstrated\nthat SOC-induced anisotropy has the ability to relieve frustration in 5d2\nsystems relative to their 5d3 counterparts, providing an explanation of the\nhigh TN found in Sr2MgOsO6.\n", "  Two-dimensional (2D) semi-Dirac materials are characterized by a quadratic\ndispersion in one direction and a linear dispersion along the orthogonal\ndirection. We study the topological phase transition in such 2D systems in the\npresence of an electromagnetic field. We show that a Chern insulating state\nemerges in a semi-Dirac system with two gapless Dirac nodes in the presence of\nlight. In particular, we show that the intensity of a circularly polarized\nlight can be used as a knob to generate topological states with nonzero Chern\nnumber. In addition, for fixed intensity and frequency of the light, a\nsemi-Dirac system with two gapped Dirac nodes with trivial band topology can\nreveal the topological transition as a function of polarization of the light.\n", "  A systematic study of the Weyl-type / Yang-Mills-type action possessing local\nconformal invariance and quadratic curvature is undertaken. The dynamical\nbreaking of this conformal invariance / scale invariance induces general\nrelativity (GR) as an effective long distance limit of the theory. We prove\nthat the corresponding field equations of the theory have the linearly rising\npotential, which naturally possesses asymptotic freedom and color confinement\nproperties of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Solutions to the neutrino mass and\ndark energy problems come as free gifts of this formulation. This approach\nprovides a strong gravity basis for the unification of quantum Yang-Mills\ntheory (QYMT) with Einstein GR.\n", "  The Short BaseLine (SBL) neutrino oscillation anomalies hint at the presence\nof a sterile neutrino with a mass of around 1 eV. However, such a neutrino is\nincompatible with cosmological data, in particular observations of the Cosmic\nMicrowave Background (CMB) anisotropies. However, this conclusion can change by\ninvoking new physics. One possibility is to introduce a secret interaction in\nthe sterile neutrino sector mediated by a light pseudoscalar. In this\npseudoscalar model, CMB data prefer a sterile neutrino mass that is fully\ncompatible with the mass ranges suggested by SBL anomalies. In addition, this\nmodel predicts a value of the Hubble parameter which is completely consistent\nwith local measurements.\n", "  We introduce the driven discrete time quantum walk, where walkers are added\nduring the walk instead of only at the beginning. This leads to interference in\nwalker number and very different dynamics when compared to the original quantum\nwalk. These dynamics have two regimes, which we illustrate using the\none-dimensional line. Then, we explore a search application which has certain\nadvantages over current search protocols, namely that it does not require a\ncomplicated initial state nor a specific measurement time to observe the marked\nstate. Finally, we describe a potential experimental implementation using\nexisting technology.\n", "  The current-voltage characteristic and ideality factor of III-Nitride quantum\nwell light-emitting diodes (LEDs) grown on bulk GaN substrates are\ninvestigated. At operating temperature, these electrical properties exhibit a\nsimple behavior. A model in which only active-region recombinations have a\ncontribution to the LED current is found to account for experimental results.\nThe limit of LED electrical efficiency is discussed based on the model and on\nthermodynamic arguments, and implications for electroluminescent cooling are\nexamined.\n", "  Imaging structures at the molecular level is a fast developing\ninterdisciplinary research field that spans across the boundaries of physics\nand chemistry. High spatial resolution images of molecules can be obtained with\nphotons or ultrafast electrons. In addition, images of valence molecular\norbitals can be extracted via tomographic techniques based on the coherent XUV\nradiation emitted by a molecular gas exposed to an intense ultra-short infrared\nlaser pulse. In this paper, we demonstrate that similar information can be\nobtained by inverting energy resolved photoelectron spectra using a simplified\nanalytical model.\n", "  We investigate the observational constraints on the interacting holographic\ndark energy model. We consider five typical interacting models with the\ninteraction terms $Q=3\\beta H\\rho_{\\rm{de}}$, $Q=3\\beta H\\rho_{\\rm{c}}$,\n$Q=3\\beta H(\\rho_{\\rm{de}}+\\rho_{\\rm c})$, $Q=3\\beta\nH\\sqrt{\\rho_{\\rm{de}}\\rho_{\\rm c}}$, and $Q=3\\beta\nH\\frac{\\rho_{\\rm{de}}\\rho_{c}}{\\rho_{\\rm{de}}+\\rho_{\\rm c}}$, respectively,\nwhere $\\beta$ is a dimensionless coupling constant. The observational data we\nuse in this paper include the JLA compilation of type Ia supernovae data, the\nPlanck 2015 distance priors data of cosmic microwave background observation,\nthe baryon acoustic oscillations measurements, and the Hubble constant direct\nmeasurement. We make a comparison for these five interacting holographic dark\nenergy models by employing the information criteria, and we find that, within\nthe framework of holographic dark energy, the $Q=3\\beta\nH\\frac{\\rho_{\\rm{de}}\\rho_{\\rm c}}{\\rho_{\\rm{ de}}+\\rho_{\\rm c}}$ model is most\nfavored by current data, and the $Q=3\\beta H\\rho_{\\rm c}$ model is relatively\nnot favored by current data. For the $Q=3\\beta H\\rho_{\\rm{de}}$ and $Q=3\\beta\nH\\frac{\\rho_{\\rm{de}}\\rho_{\\rm c}}{\\rho_{\\rm{ de}}+\\rho_{\\rm c}}$ models, a\npositive coupling $\\beta$ can be detected at more than 2$\\sigma$ significance.\n", "  We study both experimentally and theoretically the descending motion due to\ngravity of a fluid drop surrounded by another immiscible fluid in a confined\nspace between two parallel plates, i.e., in the Hele-Shaw cell. As a result, we\nshow a new scaling regime of a nonlinear drag friction in viscous liquid that\nreplaces the well-known Stokes' drag friction through a clear collapse of\nexperimental data thanks to the scaling law. In the novel regime, the\ndissipation in the liquid thin film formed between the drop and cell walls\ngoverns the dynamics. The crossover of this scaling regime to another scaling\nregime in which the dissipation inside the droplet is dominant is clearly\ndemonstrated and a phase diagram separating these scaling regimes is presented.\n", "  We study the ordered moment direction in the extended Kitaev-Heisenberg model\nrelevant to honeycomb lattice magnets with strong spin-orbit coupling. We\nutilize numerical diagonalization and analyze the exact cluster groundstates\nusing a particular set of spin coherent states, obtaining thereby quantum\ncorrections to the magnetic anisotropy beyond conventional perturbative\nmethods. It is found that the quantum fluctuations strongly modify the moment\ndirection obtained at a classical level, and are thus crucial for a precise\nquantification of the interactions. The results show that the moment direction\nis a sensitive probe of the model parameters in real materials. Focusing on the\nexperimentally relevant zigzag phases of the model, we analyze the currently\navailable neutron and resonant x-ray diffraction data on Na2IrO3 and RuCl3, and\ndiscuss the parameter regimes plausible in these Kitaev-Heisenberg model\nsystems.\n", "  We discuss a closure of commutator algebras for general functionals in terms\nof Nambu-Goldstone fermions and their derivative terms under nonlinear\nsupersymmetry (NLSUSY) both in flat spacetime and in curved spacetime. We point\nout that variations of functionals for vector supermultiplets (uniquely)\ndetermine general LSUSY transformations for linear vector supermutiplets with\ngeneral auxiliary fields in extended SUSY, where the closure of the commutator\nalgebras for NLSUSY plays a crucial role.\n", "  We theoretically study the phase behaviour of monolayers of hard rod-plate\nmixtures using a fundamental-measure density functional in the\nrestricted-orientation (Zwanzig) approximation. We consider both species to be\nsubject to an attractive potential proportional to the particle contact area on\nthe surface and with adsorption strengths that depend on the species type.\nParticles have board-like shape, with sizes chosen using a symmetry criterion:\nsame volume and same aspect ratio $\\kappa$. Phase diagrams were calculated for\n$\\kappa=10$, 20 and 40 and different values of adsorption strengths. For small\nadsorption strengths the mixtures exhibit a second-order uniaxial\nnematic-biaxial nematic transition for molar fraction of rods $0\\leq x\\lesssim\n0.9$. In the uniaxial nematic phase the particle axes of rods and plates are\naligned perpendicular and parallel to the monolayer, respectively. At the\ntransition, the orientational symmetry of the plate axes is broken, and they\norient parallel to a director lying on the surface. For large and equal\nadsorption strengths the mixture demixes at low pressures into a uniaxial\nnematic phase, rich in plates, and a biaxial nematic phase, rich in rods. This\ndemixing is located between two tricritical points. Also, at higher pressures\nand in the plate-rich part of the phase diagram, the system exhibits a strong\nfirst-order uniaxial nematic-biaxial nematic phase transition with a large\ndensity coexistence gap. When rod adsorption is considerably large while that\nof plates is small, the transition to the biaxial nematic phase is always of\nsecond order. At very high pressures the mixture can effectively be identified\nas a two-dimensional mixture of squares and rectangles which again demixes\nabove a certain critical point. We also studied the relative stability of\nuniform phases with respect to density modulations of smectic, columnar and\ncrystalline symmetry.\n", "  This work presents a detailed study of the dispersion of capillary waves with\nsmall amplitude in viscous fluids using an analytically derived solution to the\ninitial value problem of a small-amplitude capillary wave as well as direct\nnumerical simulation. A rational parametrization for the dispersion of\ncapillary waves in the underdamped regime is proposed, including predictions\nfor the wavenumber of critical damping based on a harmonic oscillator model.\nThe scaling resulting from this parametrization leads to a self-similar\nsolution of the frequency dispersion of capillary waves that covers the entire\nunderdamped regime, which allows an accurate evaluation of the frequency at a\ngiven wavenumber, irrespective of the fluid properties. This similarity also\nreveals characteristic features of capillary waves, for instance that critical\ndamping occurs when the characteristic timescales of dispersive and dissipative\nmechanisms are balanced. In addition, the presented results suggest that the\nwidely adopted hydrodynamic theory for damped capillary waves does not\naccurately predict the dispersion when viscous damping is significant and a new\ndefinition of the damping rate, which provides consistent accuracy in the\nunderdamped regime, is presented.\n", "  The most realistic situations in quantum mechanics involve the interaction\nbetween two or more systems. In the most of reliable models, the form and\nstructure of the interactions generate differential equations which are, in the\nmost of cases, almost impossible to solve exactly. In this paper, using the\nSchwinger Quantum Action Principle, we found the time transformation function\nthat solves exactly the harmonic oscillator interacting with a set of other\nharmonic coupled oscillators. In order to do it, we have introduced a new\nspecial set of creation and annihilation operators which leads directly to the\n\\emph{dressed states} associated to the system, which are the real quantum\nstates of the interacting \\emph{\\textquotedblleft\nfield-particle\\textquotedblright} system. To obtain the closed solution, it is\nintroduced in the same foot a set of \\emph{normal mode} creation and\nannihilation operators of the system related to the first ones by an orthogonal\ntransformation. We find the eigenstates, amplitude transitions and the system\nspectra without any approximation. At last, we show that the Schwinger\nVariational Principle provides the solutions in a free representation way.\n", "  We consider a general charged, rotating black hole in five-dimensional STU\nsupergravity, and show that its six-dimensional Kaluza-Klein lift admits a\nKilling-Yano 3-form with torsion. This underlies its known Killing tensors in\nfive dimensions, and is related to the separability of torsion-modified Dirac\nequations. In the generalization to gauged supergravity, we present a\nfive-dimensional Killing-Yano 3-form with torsion when two of the gauge fields\nare equal, and a Killing-Stackel tensor in the general 3-charge Wu solution.\n", "  The habitability of planets in binary star systems depends not only on the\nradiation environment created by the two stars, but also on the perturbations\nto planetary orbits and rotation produced by the gravitational field of the\nbinary and neighbouring planets. Habitable planets in binaries may therefore\nexperience significant perturbations in orbit and spin. The direct effects of\norbital resonances and secular evolution on the climate of binary planets\nremain largely unconsidered.\n  We present latitudinal energy balance modelling of exoplanet climates with\ndirect coupling to an N Body integrator and an obliquity evolution model. This\nallows us to simultaneously investigate the thermal and dynamical evolution of\nplanets orbiting binary stars, and discover gravito-climatic oscillations on\ndynamical and secular timescales.\n  We investigate the Kepler-47 and Alpha Centauri systems as archetypes of P\nand S type binary systems respectively. In the first case, Earthlike planets\nwould experience rapid Milankovitch cycles (of order 1000 years) in\neccentricity, obliquity and precession, inducing temperature oscillations of\nsimilar periods (modulated by other planets in the system). These secular\ntemperature variations have amplitudes similar to those induced on the much\nshorter timescale of the binary period.\n  In the Alpha Centauri system, the influence of the secondary produces\neccentricity variations on 15,000 year timescales. This produces climate\noscillations of similar strength to the variation on the orbital timescale of\nthe binary. Phase drifts between eccentricity and obliquity oscillations\ncreates further cycles that are of order 100,000 years in duration, which are\nfurther modulated by neighbouring planets.\n", "  Dark matter effects may be attributed to interactions between the Machian\nstrings connecting every pair of elementary particles in the observable\nUniverse. A simple model for the interaction between Machian strings is\nproposed. In the early Universe, the Machian strings of a density perturbation\nhad a spherically symmetric distribution and the interaction with the Machian\nstrings of a test particle is found to give a multiple of the Newtonian\ngravitational acceleration. In a strong gravitational field, the interaction\nbetween Machian strings tends to a constant limit in order to ensure the\nabsence of dark matter effects in the Solar System. Dark matter effects on a\ngalactic scale may be attributed to a change in the distribution of the Machian\nstrings around a galaxy during the process of galaxy formation. The interaction\nbetween the Machian strings of a test mass and the Machian strings of a galaxy\nis considered in detail and the MOND phenomenology for galaxy rotation curves\nis obtained.\n", "  In this paper, we perform analysis of the fluid velocity vector field\ndivergence $\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{u}$ derived from the continuity equation, and we\nexplore its application in the Navier-Stokes equations for compressible fluids\n$\\rho (\\vec{x},t)\\ne const$, occupying all of $\\vec{x}\\in R^{3} $ space at any\n$t\\geq 0$. The resulting velocity vector field divergence $\\nabla \\cdot\n\\vec{u}=-\\frac{1}{\\rho } (\\frac{\\partial \\rho }{\\partial t} +\\vec{u}\\cdot\n\\nabla \\rho )$ is a direct consequence of the fluid density rate of change over\ntime $\\frac{\\partial \\rho }{\\partial t}$ and over space $\\nabla \\rho $, in\naddition to the fluid velocity vector field $\\vec{u}(\\vec{x},t)$ and the fluid\ndensity $\\rho (\\vec{x},t)$ itself. We derive the conditions for the\ndivergence-free fluid velocity vector field $\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{u}=0$ in\nscenarios when the fluid density is not constant $\\rho(\\vec{x},t)\\neq const$\nover space nor time, and we analyze scenarios of the non-zero divergence\n$\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{u}\\ne 0$. We apply the statement for divergence in the\nNavier-Stokes equation for compressible fluids, and we deduct the condition for\nvanishing (zero) viscosity term of the compressible Navier-Stokes equation:\n$\\nabla (\\frac{1}{\\rho } (\\frac{\\partial \\rho }{\\partial t} +\\vec{u}\\cdot\n\\nabla \\rho ))=-3\\Delta \\vec{u}$. In addition to that, we derive even more\nelementary condition for vanishing viscosity, stating that vanishing viscosity\nis triggered once scalar function $d(\\vec{x},t)=-\\frac{1}{\\rho }\n(\\frac{\\partial \\rho }{\\partial t} +\\vec{u}\\cdot \\nabla \\rho )$ is harmonic\nfunction. Once that condition is satisfied, the viscosity related term of the\nNavier-Stokes equations for compressible fluids equals to zero, which is known\nas related to turbulent fluid flows.\n", "  Double-perovskite oxides that contain both 3d and 5d transition metal\nelements have attracted growing interest as they provide a model system to\nstudy the interplay of strong electron interaction and large spin-orbit\ncoupling (SOC). Here, we report on experimental and theoretical studies of the\nmagnetic and electronic properties of double-perovskites\n(La$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$)$_2$CuIrO$_6$ ($x$ = 0.0, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3). The undoped\nLa$_2$CuIrO$_6$ undergoes a magnetic phase transition from paramagnetism to\nantiferromagnetism at T$_N$ $\\sim$ 74 K and exhibits a weak ferromagnetic\nbehavior below $T_C$ $\\sim$ 52 K. Two-dimensional magnetism that was observed\nin many other Cu-based double-perovskites is absent in our samples, which may\nbe due to the existence of weak Cu-Ir exchange interaction. First-principle\ndensity-functional theory (DFT) calculations show canted antiferromagnetic\n(AFM) order in both Cu$^{2+}$ and Ir$^{4+}$ sublattices, which gives rise to\nweak ferromagnetism. Electronic structure calculations suggest that\nLa$_2$CuIrO$_6$ is an SOC-driven Mott insulator with an energy gap of $\\sim$\n0.3 eV. Sr-doping decreases the magnetic ordering temperatures ($T_N$ and\n$T_C$) and suppresses the electrical resistivity. The high temperatures\nresistivity can be fitted using a variable-range-hopping model, consistent with\nthe existence of disorders in these double-pervoskite compounds.\n", "  Rechargeable lithium ion batteries are an attractive alternative power source\nfor a wide variety of applications. To optimize their performances, a complete\ndescription of the solvation properties of the ion in the electrolyte is\ncrucial. A comprehensive understanding at the nanoscale of the solvation\nstructure of lithium ions in nonaqueous carbonate electrolytes is, however,\nstill unclear. We have measured by femtosecond vibrational spectroscopy the\norientational correlation time of the CO stretching mode of Li+-bound and\nLi+-unbound ethylene carbonate molecules, in LiBF4, LiPF6, and LiClO4 ethylene\ncarbonate solutions with different concentrations. Surprisingly, we have found\nthat the coordination number of ethylene carbonate in the first solvation shell\nof Li+ is only two, in all solutions with concentrations higher than 0.5 M.\nDensity functional theory calculations indicate that the presence of anions in\nthe first coordination shell modifies the generally accepted tetrahedral\nstructure of the complex, allowing only two EC molecules to coordinate to Li+\ndirectly. Our results demonstrate for the first time, to the best of our\nknowledge, the anion influence on the overall structure of the first solvation\nshell of the Li+ ion. The formation of such a cation/solvent/anion complex\nprovides a rational explanation for the ionic conductivity drop of\nlithium/carbonate electrolyte solutions at high concentrations.\n", "  We identify a precise geometric relationship between: (i) certain natural\npairs of irreducible reflection groups (\"Coxeter pairs\"); (ii) self-similar\nquasicrystalline patterns formed by superposing sets of 1D\nquasi-periodically-spaced lines, planes or hyper-planes (\"Ammann patterns\");\nand (iii) the tilings dual to these patterns (\"Penrose-like tilings\"). We use\nthis relationship to obtain all irreducible Ammann patterns and their dual\nPenrose-like tilings, along with their key properties in a simple, systematic\nand unified way, expanding the number of known examples from four to infinity.\nFor each symmetry, we identify the minimal Ammann patterns (those composed of\nthe fewest 1d quasiperiodic sets) and construct the associated Penrose-like\ntilings: six in 2D, five in 3D and one in 4D. These include the original\nPenrose tiling, the three other previously known Penrose-like tilings, and\neight that are new. We also complete the enumeration of the\nquasicrystallographic space groups corresponding to the irreducible\nnon-crystallographic reflection groups, by showing that there is a unique such\nspace group in 4D (with nothing beyond 4D).\n", "  We study 1D quasilattices, especially self-similar ones that can be used to\ngenerate two-, three- and higher-dimensional quasicrystalline tesselations that\nhave matching rules and invertible self-similar substitution rules (also known\nas inflation rules) analogous to the rules for generating Penrose tilings. The\nlattice positions can be expressed in a closed-form expression we call\n\\emph{floor form}: $x_{n} = S (n-\\alpha) + (L-S) \\lfloor \\kappa (n-\\beta)\n\\rfloor$, where $L > S > 0$ and $0 < \\kappa < 1$ is an irrational number. We\ndescribe three equivalent geometric constructions of these quasilattices and\nshow how they can be subdivided into various types of equivalence classes: (i)\n\\emph{lattice equivalent}, where any two quasilattices in the same lattice\nequivalence class may be derived from one another by a local decoration/gluing\nrule; (ii) \\emph{self-similar}, a proper subset of lattice equivalent where, in\naddition, the two quasilattices are locally isomorphic; and (iii)\n\\emph{self-same}, a proper subset of self-similar where, in addition, the two\nquasilattices are globally isomorphic (i.e. identical up to rescaling). For all\nthree types of equivalence class, we obtain the explicit transformation law\nbetween the floor form expression for two quasilattices in the same class. We\ntabulate (in Table 1 and Figure 5) the ten special self-similar 1D\nquasilattices relevant for constructing Ammann patterns and Penrose-like\ntilings in two dimensions and higher, and we explicitly construct and catalog\nthe corresponding self-same quasilattices. Finally, we sketch the extension of\nour results from degree two to degree $N$ (i.e to 1D quasilattices built from\n$N$ different intervals).\n", "  This report, based on the Dark Sectors workshop at SLAC in April 2016,\nsummarizes the scientific importance of searches for dark sector dark matter\nand forces at masses beneath the weak-scale, the status of this broad\ninternational field, the important milestones motivating future exploration,\nand promising experimental opportunities to reach these milestones over the\nnext 5-10 years.\n", "  Consequences of an exceedingly strong electric field (E field) on the ground\nstate energetics and transport properties of a 2D spinless electron gas in a\nperpendicular magnetic field (a Quantum Hall Effect (QHE) configuration) are\ninvestigated to all orders in the fields. For a conventional semiconductor, we\nfind fractional values of the Hall conductivity and some magnetoelectric\ncoefficients for certain values of E and B fields that do not result from\ninteractions or impurities, but are a pure consequence of a strong enough\nin-plane E field. We also determine analytically the ground state energy, and\nresponse properties such as magnetization and polarization as functions of the\nelectromagnetic field in the strong E field limit. In the case of Graphene, we\nobtain more complex behaviors leading to the possibility of irrational Hall\nvalues. The results are also qualitatively discussed in connection to various\nmechanisms for the QHE-breakdown.\n", "  We prove that canonical Dirac expression with linear potential generates\noperators on axis and half axis, for which we can find the eigenvalues and\neigenfunctions in explicit form. We construct the perturbations of these\noperators with in advance given spectra.\n", "  Until recently, there have been few studies of the protostellar evolution of\nintermediate-mass (IM) stars, which may bridge the low- and high-mass regimes.\nThis paper aims to investigate whether the properties of an IM protostar within\nthe IRAS 05373+2349 embedded cluster are similar to that of low- and/or\nhigh-mass protostars. We carried out Very Large Array as well as Combined Array\nfor Research in Millimeter Astronomy continuum and 12CO(J=1-0) observations,\nwhich uncover seven radio continuum sources (VLA 1-7). The spectral index of\nVLA 2, associated with the IM protostar is consistent with an ionised stellar\nwind or jet. The source VLA 3 is coincident with previously observed H2\nemission line objects aligned in the north-south direction (P.A. -20 to -12\ndeg), which may be either an ionised jet emanating from VLA 2 or\n(shock-)ionised cavity walls in the large-scale outflow from VLA 2. The\nposition angle between VLA 2 and 3 is slightly misaligned with the large-scale\noutflow we map at ~5-arcsec resolution in 12CO (P.A. ~30 deg), which in the\ncase of a jet suggests precession. The emission from the mm core associated\nwith VLA 2 is also detected; we estimate its mass to be 12-23 Msun, depending\non the contribution from ionised gas. Furthermore, the large-scale outflow has\nproperties intermediate between outflows from low- and high-mass young stars.\nTherefore, we conclude that the IM protostar within IRAS 05373+2349 is\nphenomenologically as well as quantitatively intermediate between the low- and\nhigh-mass domains.\n", "  We explore the feasibility of direct measurements of nuclear gluon densities\nusing heavy-quark production (open charm, beauty) at a future Electron-Ion\nCollider (EIC). We focus on the regions x > 0.3 (EMC effect) and x ~ 0.05-0.1\n(antishadowing), where the nuclear modifications of the gluon density offer\ninsight into non-nucleonic degrees of freedom and the QCD structure of\nnucleon-nucleon interactions. We describe the charm production rates and\nmomentum distributions in nuclear deep-inelastic scattering (DIS) at large x_B,\nand comment on the possible methods for charm reconstruction using\nnext-generation detectors at the EIC (pi/K identification, tracking, vertex\ndetection).\n", "  The first domestic inorganic scintillator CLYC was grown in Beijing Glass\nResearch Instituteusing the vertical Bridgman method. In this work, we\nevaluated the performance of this new CLYC crystal in terms of gamma-ray energy\nresolution and pulse shape discrimination(PSD)capability between neutrons and\ngamma-rays. The decay times occurred throughdifferent scintillation mechanisms\nwere achievedby fitting decay functions to the neutron and gamma-ray waveform\nstructures. We found an energy resolution of 4.5% for 662-keV gamma-rays and\nefficient neutron/gamma PSD withFoM 2.6. Under gamma-ray excitation, there is\nultrafast scintillation mechanism in CLYC, with a decay time about 2\nns,whereasthere is no evidence of ultrafast decay under thermal neutron\nexcitation. This work contributes to promote domestic development of CLYC.\n", "  Spreading processes are often modelled as a stochastic dynamics occurring on\ntop of a given network with edge weights corresponding to the transmission\nprobabilities. Knowledge of veracious transmission probabilities is essential\nfor prediction, optimization, and control of diffusion dynamics. Unfortunately,\nin most cases the transmission rates are unknown and need to be reconstructed\nfrom the spreading data. Moreover, in realistic settings it is impossible to\nmonitor the state of each node at every time, and thus the data is highly\nincomplete. We introduce an efficient dynamic message-passing algorithm, which\nis able to reconstruct parameters of the spreading model given only partial\ninformation on the activation times of nodes in the network. The method is\ngeneralizable to a large class of dynamic models, as well to the case of\ntemporal graphs.\n", "  We study a model of nonintersecting Brownian bridges on an interval with\neither absorbing or reflecting walls at the boundaries, focusing on the point\nin space-time at which the particles meet the wall. These processes are\ndeterminantal, and in different scaling limits when the particles approach the\nreflecting (resp. absorbing) walls we obtain hard-edge limiting kernels which\nare the even (resp. odd) parts of the Pearcey and tacnode kernels. We also show\nthat in the single time case, our hard-edge tacnode kernels are equivalent to\nthe ones studied by Delvaux [16], defined in terms of a $4\\times 4$ Lax pair\nfor the inhomogeneous Painlev\\'{e} II equation (PII). As a technical ingredient\nin the proof, we construct a Schlesinger transform for the $4 \\times 4$ Lax\npair in [16] which preserves the Hastings--McLeod solutions to PII.\n", "  The new code for numerical simulation of magnetic hydrodynamical\nastrophysical flows with consideration of chemical reactions is given in the\npaper. At the heart of the code - the new original low-dissipation numerical\nmethod based on a combination of operator splitting approach and\npiecewise-parabolic method on the local stencil. The details of the numerical\nmethod are described; the main tests and the scheme of parallel implementation\nare shown. The chemodynamics of the hydrogen while the turbulent formation of\nmolecular clouds is modeled.\n", "  Atomically thin rhenium disulphide (ReS2) is a member of the transition metal\ndichalcogenide (TMDC) family of materials characterized by weak interlayer\ncoupling and a distorted 1T structure. Here, we report on the electrical\ntransport study of mono- and multilayer ReS2 with polymer electrolyte gating.\nWe find that the conductivity of monolayer ReS2 is completely suppressed at\nhigh carrier densities, an unusual feature unique to monolayers, making ReS2\nthe first example of such a material. While thicker flakes of ReS2 also exhibit\na conductivity dome and an insulator-metal-insulator sequence, they do not show\na complete conductivity suppression at high doping densities. Using dual-gated\ndevices, we can distinguish the gate-induced doping from the electrostatic\ndisorder induced by the polymer electrolyte itself. Theoretical calculations\nand a transport model indicate that the observed conductivity suppression can\nbe explained by a combination of a narrow conduction band and Anderson\nlocalization due to electrolyte-induced disorder.\n", "  We introduce spatiotemporal optical dark X solitary waves of the (2+1)D\n{hyperbolic} nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation (NLSE), that rules wave\npropagation in a self-focusing and normally dispersive medium. These analytical\nsolutions are derived by exploiting the connection between such NLSE and a well\nknown equation of hydrodynamics, namely the type II Kadomtsev-Petviashvili\n(KP-II) equation. As a result, families of shallow water X soliton solutions of\nthe KP-II equation are mapped into optical dark X solitary wave solutions of\nthe NLSE. Numerical simulations show that optical dark X solitary waves may\npropagate for long distances (tens of nonlinear lengths) before they eventually\nbreak up, owing to the modulation instability of the continuous wave\nbackground. This finding opens a novel path for the excitation and control of X\nsolitary waves in nonlinear optics.\n", "  Beginning in March 2014, the OSIRIS (Optical, Spectroscopic, and Infrared\nRemote Imaging System) cameras began capturing images of the nucleus and coma\n(gas and dust) of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko using both the wide angle\ncamera (WAC) and the narrow angle camera (NAC). The many observations taken\nsince July of 2014 have been used to study the morphology, location, and\ntemporal variation of the comet's dust jets. We analyzed the dust monitoring\nobservations shortly after the southern vernal equinox on May 30 and 31, 2015\nwith the WAC at the heliocentric distance Rh = 1.53 AU, where it is possible to\nobserve that the jet rotates with the nucleus. We found that the decline of\nbrightness as a function of the distance of the jet is much steeper than the\nbackground coma, which is a first indication of sublimation. We adapted a model\nof sublimation of icy aggregates and studied the effect as a function of the\nphysical properties of the aggregates (composition and size). The major finding\nof this article was that through the sublimation of the aggregates of dirty\ngrains (radius a between 5 microm and 50 microm) we were able to completely\nreproduce the radial brightness profile of a jet beyond 4 km from the nucleus.\nTo reproduce the data we needed to inject a number of aggregates between 8.5 x\n$10^{13}$ and 8.5 x $10^{10}$ for a = 5 microm and 50 microm respectively, or\nan initial mass of $H_2O$ ice around 22kg.\n", "  Statistical spectral distribution method based on shell model and random\nmatrix theory is developed for calculating neutrinoless double beta decay\nnuclear transition matrix elements. First results obtained for $^{82}$Se and\n$^{76}$Ge using the spectral method are close to the available shell model\nresults.\n", "  The phenomenon of aging in soft matter systems is an intriguing and\ninteresting. In his study we investigate the microstructure and aging dynamics\nof fluorescent nanoclay gels formed from the mixture of small (~25) and large\n(~250) aspect ratio nanodiscs using various experimental techniques. We examine\nhow the presence of one kind of clay in other clay of different nature affect\nthe aging dynamics, microstructure and the final resulting phase. Viscosity of\nthe dispersions grows as a power-law with waiting time of the system and the\ndispersions initially show Maxwellian behaviour but deviated as the time\nprogressed. Fractal dimension, df of the gels is found to be 2.5. Confocal\nmicrographs revealed clear grain boundaries in the nanoclay gels, since\nNa-Montmorillonite exhibit fluorescence. We also report for the first time that\nthe gels containing sodium MMT gives a bright green-yellow fluorescence in\nultra violet light. These fluorescent gels may be useful in industry and\nacademic research.\n", "  It has long been unclear if the small-scale magnetic structures on the\nneutron star (NS) surface could survive the fall-back episode. The study of the\nHall cascade (Cumming, Arras and Zweibel 2004; Wareing and Hollerbach 2009)\nhinted that energy in small scales structures should dissipate on short\ntimescales. Our new 2D magneto-thermal simulations suggest the opposite. For\nthe first $\\sim$10 kyrs after the fall-back episode with accreted mass $10^{-3}\nM_\\odot$, the observed NS magnetic field appears dipolar, which is insensitive\nto the initial magnetic topology. In framework of the Ruderman & Sutherland\n(1975) vacuum gap model during this interval, non-thermal radiation is strongly\nsuppressed. After this time the initial (i.e. multipolar) structure begins to\nre-emerge through the NS crust. We distinguish three evolutionary epochs for\nthe re-emergence process: the growth of internal toroidal field, the advection\nof buried poloidal field, and slow Ohmic diffusion. The efficiency of the first\ntwo stages can be enhanced when small-scale magnetic structure is present. The\nefficient re-emergence of high order harmonics might significantly affect the\ncurvature of the magnetospheric field lines in the emission zone. So, only\nafter few $10^4$ yrs would the NS starts shining as a pulsar again, which is in\ncorrespondence with radio silence of central compact objects (CCOs). In\naddition, these results can explain the absence of good candidates for\nthermally emitting NSs with freshly re-emerged field among radio pulsars\n(Bogdanov, Ng and Kaspi 2014), as NSs have time to cool down, and supernova\nremnants can already dissipate.\n", "  The overall aim of the Space Situational Awareness (SSA) Preparatory\nProgramme is to support the European independent utilisation of and access to\nspace for research or services, through providing timely and quality data,\ninformation, services and knowledge regarding the environment, the threats and\nthe sustainable exploitation of the outer space surrounding our planet Earth.\nThe SSA system will comprise three main segments: Space Weather (SWE)\nmonitoring and forecast Near-Earth Objects (NEO) survey and follow-up Space\nSurveillance and Tracking (SST) of man-made space objects. There already exist\ndifferent algorithms to predict orbits for NEOs. The objective of this activity\nis to come up with a different trajectory prediction algorithm, which allows an\nindependent validation of the current algorithms within the SSA-NEO segment\n(e.g. NEODyS, JPL Sentry System). The key objective of this activity was to\ndesign, develop, test, verify, and validate trajectory prediction algorithm of\nNEOs in order to be able to compute analytically and numerically the minimum\norbital intersection distances (MOIDs). The NEOPROP software consists of two\nseparate modules/tools: (i) the Analytical Module makes use of analytical\nalgorithms in order to rapidly assess the impact risk of a NEO. (ii) The\nNumerical Module makes use of numerical algorithms in order to refine and to\nbetter assess the impact probabilities.\n", "  Spin selective nature of spin-filter tunnel junctions can be integrated with\nconventional metallic ferromagnets to regulate spin polarized quasiparticles in\nsuperconducting devices. We report fabrication of pseudo spin-valve device made\nwith a bilayer of nitride spin-filter tunnel barrier (DyN or GdN) and a\ntransition metal ferromagnet (Co and Gd). We show resistance switching in these\ndevices corresponding to parallel and antiparallel configuration of their\nmutual magnetization direction. With optimal deposition process partial\nnitridation of the Co layer can be achieved. The magnetically dead native\nCoN$_x$ layer at the Co-DyN interface acts the role of the barrier in these\ndevices. In pseudo spin-valve with Co, lower resistance was found for\nantiparallel state compared to parallel configuration. Reverse resistance\nswitching behavior was observed for the pseudo spin-valves with Gd. Presence of\nresistance switching in these devices further confirm the spin-filtering nature\nof DyN and GdN tunnel barrier. Quasiparticle transport at different\ntemperatures in these devices was found to be compatible with conventional\nN-I-S tunnelling model. These devices can be further engineered to regulate\nspin polarized supercurrent in superconducting spintronics devices.\n", "  A standard scientific study comprises two processes: one is to describe a\nthing, and the other is to understand how the thing works. In order to\nunderstand the principle of urban growth, a number of shape indexes are\nproposed to describe the size and shape of cities. However, the comparability\nof a shape index is often influenced by the resolution of remote sensing images\nor digital maps because the calculated values depend on spatial measurement\nscales. This paper is devoted to exploring the scaling in classical shape\nindexes. Two typical regular fractals, Koch's island and Vicsek's figure, are\nemployed to illustrate the property of scale dependence of many shape indexes.\nTwo main problems are solved in this work. First, several different correlated\nshape indexes such as circularity ratios and compactness ratios are normalized\nand unified by substituting Feret's diameter for the major axis of urban\nfigure. Second, three levels of scaling in shape indexes are revealed, and\nshape indexes are classified into three groups. The significance of this study\nlies in two aspects. One is helpful for realizing the deep structure of urban\nform, and the other is useful for clarifying the spheres of application of\ndifferent types of shape indexes.\n", "  We introduce an $N=1$ supergravity model based on the gauged shift symmetry\nof a single chiral multiplet, which can be identified with the string dilaton\nor a compactification modulus. The model allows for a tunably small and\npositive value of the cosmological constant. The gravitino mass parameter and\nthe dilaton Vacuum Expectation Value are separately tunable.\n  In a second part we analyze the quantum consistency of these models. Recent\nwork on anomalies in supergravity theories with Fayet-Iliopoulos terms was\nextended, such that their results can be interpreted from a field-theoretic\npoint of view. We show that for certain values of the parameters the anomaly\ncancellation conditions are inconsistent with a TeV gravitino mass.\n  In the third part the above model is used as a hidden sector for\nsupersymmetry breaking. In its minimal version, the model leads to tachyonic\nscalar soft masses. This problem can however be circumvented by the\nintroduction of an extra Pol\\'onyi-like hidden sector field, or by allowing for\nnon-canonical kinetic terms for the Standard Model fields, while maintaining\nthe desirable features of the model. The resulting low energy spectrum consists\nof very light neutralinos, charginos and gluinos, while the squarks remain\nheavy, with the exception of the stop squark which can be as light as 2 TeV.\n  Finally, we discus possibility that the shift symmetry is identified with\nknown global symmetries of the MSSM. The particular cases where this global\nsymmetry is Baryon minus Lepton number ($B-L$), or $3B-L$, which contain the\nknown R-parity or matter parity of the MSSM, are analyzed in great detail. It\nis shown that the phenomenology is similar to the above case where the MSSM\nfields are inert, with the exception of the stop squark, which can be as light\nas $1.5$ TeV.\n", "  We consider the Schrodinger equation with a generalized uncertainty principle\nfor a free particle. We then transform the problem into a second ordinary\ndifferential equation and thereby obtain the corresponding propagator. The\nresult of ordinary quantum mechanics is recovered for vanishing minimal length\nparameter.\n", "  It is well known that the field equations of teleparallel theory which is\nequivalent to general relativity (TEGR) completely agree with the field\nequation of general relativity (GR). However, TEGR has six extra degrees of\nfreedom which spoil the true physics. These extra degrees are related to the\nlocal Lorentz transformation. In this study, we give three different tetrads of\nflat horizon space-time that depend only on the radial coordinate. One of these\ntetrads contains an arbitrary function which comes from local Lorentz\ntransformation. We show by explicate calculations that this arbitrary function\nspoils the calculations of the conserved charges. We formulate {\\it a\nskew-symmetric tensor} whose vanishing value put a constraint on the arbitrary\nfunction. This constraint makes the conserved charges are free from the\narbitrary function.\n", "  It is shown that the Reissner-Nordstrom black hole is also a gravitational\nSchwinger ball. It is also shown that both massless and massive-particle\ngravitational Schwinger balls are thermodynamic systems by deriving the first\nlaw of thermodynamics for them. Inconsistency between classical geometrical and\nmicroscopic definitions of the horizon is discussed. We propose a new metric,\nmore consistent with microscopic picture of black hole, as gravitational\nSchwinger ball, by speculations. It has some interesting features.\n", "  Light propagation in periodic environments is often associated with a number\nof interesting and potentially useful processes. If a crystalline optical\npotential is also linearly ramped, light can undergo periodic Bloch\noscillations, a direct outcome of localized Wannier-Stark states and their\nequidistant eigenvalue spectrum. Even though these effects have been\nextensively explored in conservative settings, this is by no means the case in\nnon-Hermitian photonic lattices encompassing both amplification and\nattenuation. Quite recently, Bloch oscillations have been predicted in\nparity-time-symmetric structures involving gain and loss in a balanced fashion.\nWhile in a complex bulk medium, one intuitively expects that light will\ntypically follow the path of highest amplification, in a periodic system this\nbehavior can be substantially altered by the underlying band structure. Here,\nwe report the first experimental observation of Bloch oscillations in\nparity-time-symmetric mesh lattices. We show that these revivals exhibit\nunusual properties like secondary emissions and resonant restoration of PT\nsymmetry. In addition, we present a versatile method for reconstructing the\nreal and imaginary components of the band structure by directly monitoring the\nlight evolution during a cycle of these oscillations.\n", "  We demonstrate the fabrication of sub-micron layers of single-crystal diamond\nsuitable for subsequent processing as demonstrated by this test ring structure.\nThis method is a significant enabling technology for nanomechanical and\nphotonic structures incorporating colour-centres. The process uses a novel\ndouble implant process, annealing and chemical etching to produce membranes of\ndiamond from single-crystal starting material, the thinnest layers achieved to\ndate are 210 nm thick.\n", "  We report on the ion beam fabrication of all-carbon multi electrode arrays\n(MEAs) based on 16 graphitic micro-channels embedded in single-crystal diamond\n(SCD) substrates. The fabricated SCD-MEAs are systematically employed for the\nin vitro simultaneous amperometric detection of the secretory activity from\npopulations of chromaffin cells, demonstrating a new sensing approach with\nrespect to standard techniques. The biochemical stability and biocompatibility\nof the SCD-based device combined with the parallel recording of\nmulti-electrodes array allow: i) a significant time saving in data collection\nduring drug screening and/or pharmacological tests over a large number of\ncells, ii) the possibility of comparing altered cell functionality among cell\npopulations, and iii) the repeatition of acquisition runs over many cycles with\na fully non-toxic and chemically robust bio-sensitive substrate.\n", "  The glass transition is the most enduring grand-challenge problem in\ncontemporary condensed matter physics. Here, we review the contribution of\ncolloid experiments to our understanding of this problem. First, we briefly\noutline the success of colloidal systems in yielding microscopic insights into\na wide range of condensed matter phenomena. In the context of the glass\ntransition, we demonstrate their utility in revealing the nature of spatial and\ntemporal dynamical heterogeneity. We then discuss the evidence from colloid\nexperiments in favor of various theories of glass formation that has\naccumulated over the last two decades. In the next section, we expound on the\nrecent paradigm shift in colloid experiments from an exploratory approach to a\ncritical one aimed at distinguishing between predictions of competing\nframeworks. We demonstrate how this critical approach is aided by the discovery\nof novel dynamical crossovers within the range accessible to colloid\nexperiments. We also highlight the impact of alternate routes to glass\nformation such as random pinning, trajectory space phase transitions and\nreplica coupling on current and future research on the glass transition. We\nconclude our review by listing some key open challenges in glass physics such\nas the comparison of growing static lengthscales and the preparation of\nultrastable glasses, that can be addressed using colloid experiments.\n", "  Gravitational flow of grains in pipes is frequently encountered in industry.\nWhen the grains and pipes are size-constrained, granular flow may result in\ndensity waves consisting of alternate high- and low-compactness regions. This\npaper discusses the length scale of density waves that appear when fine grains\nfall vertically in pipes. A one-dimensional model and a linear stability\nanalysis of the model are presented. The analysis suggests the presence of\nlong-wavelength instability for the most unstable mode, moreover, a cut-off\nwavenumber from which the length scale is estimated. Finally, the model results\nare compared to experimental data.\n", "  We present ALFALFA HI observations of a well studied region of the Leo Cloud,\nwhich includes the NGC 3227 group and the NGC 3190 group. We detect optically\ndark HI tails and plumes with extents potentially exceeding 600 kpc, well\nbeyond the field of view of previous observations. These HI features contain\napproximately 40% of the total HI mass in the NGC~3227 group and 10% in the\nNGC~3190 group. We also present WSRT maps which show the complex morphology of\nthe extended emission in the NGC~3227 group. We comment on previously proposed\nmodels of the interactions in these groups and the implications for the scale\nof group processing through interactions. Motivated by the extent of the HI\nplumes, we place the HI observations in the context of the larger loose group,\ndemonstrating the need for future sensitive, wide field HI surveys to\nunderstand the role of group processing in galaxy evolution.\n", "  Within the framework of quark mass matrices with a democratic texture, the\nunitary rotation matrices that diagonalize the quark matrices are obtained by a\nspecific parametrization of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa mixing matrix.\nDifferent forms of democratic quark mass matrices are derived from slightly\ndifferent parametrizations.\n", "  Those who measure success with culmination do not seem to be aware that life\nis a journey not a destination. This spirit is best reflected in the unceasing\nfailures in efforts for solving the problem of controlled thermonuclear fusion\nfor even the simplest pinches for over decades; and the nature keeps us\nchallenging with examples. However, these efforts have permitted researchers\nthe obtention of a dense plasma with a lifetime that, albeit short, is\nsufficient to study the physics of the pinch effect, to create methods of\nplasma diagnostics, and to develop a modern theory of plasma processes. Most\nimportantly, they have impregnated the solid state plasmas, particularly the\nelectron-hole plasmas in semiconductors, which do not suffer from the issues\nrelated with the confinement and which have demonstrated their potential not\nonly for the fundamental physics but also for the device physics. Here, we\nreport on a two-component, cylindrical, quasi-one-dimensional quantum plasma\nsubjected to a {\\em radial} confining harmonic potential and an applied\nmagnetic field in the symmetric gauge. It is demonstrated that such a system as\ncan be realized in semiconducting quantum wires offers an excellent medium for\nobserving the quantum pinch effect at low temperatures. An exact analytical\nsolution of the problem allows us to make significant observations:\nsurprisingly, in contrast to the classical pinch effect, the particle density\nas well as the current density display a {\\em determinable} maximum before\nattaining a minimum at the surface of the quantum wire. The effect will persist\nas long as the equilibrium pair density is sustained. Therefore, the\ntechnological promise that emerges is the route to the precise electronic\ndevices that will control the particle beams at the nanoscale.\n", "  It is shown that the free propagator of an angular, i.e. compact, field with\nzero lagrangian mass acquires a nonzero propagator mass $\\omega$ (`kinematical'\nmass generation). To demonstrate this effect the free propagator of the\ngoldstone boson in an O(2) model with spontaneous symmetry breaking is\ncalculated. It is shown that this propagator is massive, the mass $\\omega$\nbeing a function of the scalar `condensate' ${\\bar\\phi}$.\n", "  The size of the stable elementary particles is investigated with the standing\nwave model. The particle size follows from the magnitude of the radiation\npressure. It is shown that the outward directed radiation pressure is balanced\nby the inward directed elastic force per unit area in the cubic nuclear\nlattice, provided that the sidelength of the lattice is 10^(-13) cm, which\nagrees with the measured radius of the proton r = 0.8 \\times 10^(-13) cm,\nwithin the uncertainty of the parameters.\n", "  Using a renormalized linked-cluster-expansion method, we have extended to\norder $\\beta^{23}$ the high-temperature series for the susceptibility $\\chi$\nand the second-moment correlation length $\\xi$ of the spin-1/2 Ising models on\nthe sc and the bcc lattices. A study of these expansions yields updated direct\nestimates of universal parameters, such as exponents and amplitude ratios,\nwhich characterize the critical behavior of $\\chi$ and $\\xi$. Our best\nestimates for the inverse critical temperatures are\n  $\\beta^{sc}_c=0.221654(1)$ and $\\beta^{bcc}_c=0.1573725(6)$. For the\nsusceptibility exponent we get $\\gamma=1.2375(6)$ and for the correlation\nlength exponent we get $\\nu=0.6302(4)$.\n  The ratio of the critical amplitudes of $\\chi$ above and below the critical\ntemperature is estimated to be $C_+/C_-=4.762(8)$. The analogous ratio for\n$\\xi$ is estimated to be $f_+/f_-=1.963(8)$. For the correction-to-scaling\namplitude ratio we obtain $a^+_{\\xi}/a^+_{\\chi}=0.87(6)$.\n", "  For SU(2) lattice gauge theory, a new SO(3) cooling procedure is proposed\nwhich removes the SU(2)/Z(2) coset fields from the lattice configurations and\nreveals a Z(2) vortex vacuum texture different from the P-vortex content\nobtained in the maximal center gauge. Cooling can be restricted in a\nrenormalization group invariant way by a parameter controlling the remaining\nSO(3) action density. A gauge invariant Z(2) vortex vacuum emerges\nasymptotically if cooling is not restricted. This ``vortex texture'' does not\nsupport the string tension or a finite part of it. The SU(2) action density\nassociated with the new Z(2) vortex texture has a smooth extrapolation to the\ncontinuum limit. We propose an interpretation as a mass dimension four\ncondensate related to the gluon condensate featuring in the operator product\nexpansion.\n", "  We present the main results of our microcanonical simulation of the Wess\nZumino Witten action functional. This action, being highly non-trivial and\ncapable of exhibiting many different phase transitions, is chosen to be\nrepresentative of general complex actions. We verify the applicability of\nmicrocanonical simulation by successfully obtaining two of the many critical\npoints of the Wess Zumino Witten action. The microcanonical algorithm has the\nadditional advantage of exhibiting critical behaviour for a small $8\\times 8$\nlattice. We also briefly discuss the subtleties that, in general, arise in\nsimulating a complex action. Our algorithm for complex actions can be extended\nto the study of\n  D-branes in the Wess Zumino Witten action.\n", "  We present results of the careful study of the Gribov copies problem in SU(2)\nlattice gauge theory for the direct maximal center projection widely used in\nconfinement studies. Applying simulated annealing algorithm we demonstrate that\nthis problem is more severe than it was thought before. The projected (gauge\nnoninvariant) string tension is not in the agreement with the physical string\ntension. We do not find any indications that P-vortices reproduce the full\nSU(2) string tension neither in the infinite volume limit nor in the continuum\nlimit.\n", "  Three-dimensional spin models of the Ising and XY universality classes are\nstudied by a combination of high-temperature expansions and Monte Carlo\nsimulations. Critical exponents are determined to very high precision. Scaling\namplitude ratios are computed via the critical equation of state. Our results\nare compared with other theoretical computations and with experiments, with\nspecial emphasis on the lambda transition of 4He.\n", "  We describe a Hartree ensemble method to approximately solve the Heisenberg\nequations for the \\phi^4 model in 1+1 dimensions. We compute the energies and\nnumber densities of the quantum particles described by the \\phi field and find\nthat the particles initially thermalize with a Bose-Einstein distribution for\nthe particle density. Gradually, however, the distribution changes towards\nclassical equipartition. Using suitable initial conditions quantum\nthermalization is achieved much faster than the onset of this undesirable\nequipartition. We also show how the numerical efficiency of our method can be\nsignificantly improved.\n", "  The domain wall fermion formulation exhibits full chiral symmetry for finite\nlattice spacing except for the effects of mixing between the domain walls.\nClose to the continuum limit these symmetry breaking effects should be\ndescribed by a single residual mass. We determine this mass from the\nconservation law obeyed by the conserved axial current in quenched simulations\nwith beta=5.7 and 6.0 and domain wall separations varying between 12 and 48 on\n8^3x32 and 16^3x32 lattices. Using the resulting values for the residual mass\nwe perform two complete and independent calculations of the pion decay\nconstant. Good agreement is found between these two methods and with\nexperiment.\n", "  The influence of zero-momentum gauge modes on physical observables is\ninvestigated for compact lattice QED with dynamical and quenched Wilson\nfermions. Within the Coulomb phase, zero-momentum modes are shown to hide the\ncritical behaviour of gauge invariant fermion observables near the chiral\nlimit. Methods for eliminating zero-momentum modes are discussed.\n", "  The Ginsparg-Wilson(G-W) relation for chiral symmetry is extended for a\nsupersymmetrical(SUSY) case on a lattice.\n  It is possible to define exact lattice supersymmetry which are devided into\ntwo different cases according to using difference operators.\n  $U(1)_R$ symmetry on the lattice is also realized as one of exact symmetries.\nFor an application, the extended G-W relation is given for a two-dimensional\nmodel with chiral multiplets.\n", "  The construction of multigrid operators for disordered linear lattice\noperators, in particular the fermion matrix in lattice gauge theories, by means\nof algebraic multigrid and block LU decomposition is discussed. In this\nformalism, the effective coarse-grid operator is obtained as the Schur\ncomplement of the original matrix. An optimal approximation to it is found by a\nnumerical optimization procedure akin to Monte Carlo renormalization, resulting\nin a generalized (gauge-path dependent) stencil that is easily evaluated for a\ngiven disorder field. Applications to preconditioning and relaxation methods\nare investigated.\n", "  The topological charge distribution P(Q) is calculated for lattice ${\\rm\nCP}^{N-1}$ models. In order to suppress lattice cut-off effects we employ a\nfixed point (FP) action. Through transformation of P(Q) we calculate the free\nenergy $F(\\theta)$ as a function of the $\\theta$ parameter. For N=4, scaling\nbehavior is observed for P(Q), $F(\\theta)$ as well as the correlation lengths\n$\\xi(Q)$. For N=2, however, scaling behavior is not observed as expected. For\ncomparison, we also make a calculation for the ${\\rm CP}^{3}$ model with\nstandard action. We furthermore pay special attention to the behavior of P(Q)\nin order to investigate the dynamics of instantons. For that purpose, we\ncarefully look at behavior of $\\gamma_{\\it eff}$, which is an effective power\nof P(Q)($\\sim \\exp(-CQ^{\\gamma_{\\it eff}})$), and reflects the local behavior\nof P(Q) as a function of Q. We study $\\gamma_{\\it eff}$ for two cases, one of\nwhich is the dilute gas approximation based on the Poisson distribution of\ninstantons and the other is the Debye-H\\\"uckel approximation of instanton\nquarks. In both cases we find similar behavior to the one observed in numerical\nsimulations.\n", "  This paper completes the argument that lattice simulations of partially\nquenched QCD can provide quantitative information about QCD itself, with the\naid of partially quenched chiral perturbation theory. A barrier to doing this\nhas been the inclusion of $\\Phi_0$, the partially quenched generalization of\nthe $\\eta'$, in previous calculations in the partially quenched effective\ntheory. This invalidates the low energy perturbative expansion, gives rise to\nmany new unknown parameters, and makes it impossible to reliably calculate the\nrelation between the partially quenched theory and low energy QCD. We show that\nit is straightforward and natural to formulate partially quenched chiral\nperturbation theory without $\\Phi_0$, and that the resulting theory contains\nthe effective theory for QCD without the $\\eta'$. We also show that previous\nresults, obtained including $\\Phi_0$, can be reinterpreted as applying to the\ntheory without $\\Phi_0$. We contrast the situation with that in the quenched\neffective theory, where we explain why it is necessary to include $\\Phi_0$.\n  We also compare the derivation of chiral perturbation theory in partially\nquenched QCD with the standard derivation in unquenched QCD. We find that the\nformer cannot be justified as rigorously as the latter, because of the absence\nof a physical Hilbert space. Finally, we present an encouraging result:\nunphysical double poles in certain correlation functions in partially quenched\nchiral perturbation theory can be shown to be a property of the underlying\ntheory, given only the symmetries and some plausible assumptions.\n", "  We consider correlation functions containing the axial current of one light\nand one heavy quark in the static approximation as well as in full QCD, using\nthe lattice regularization. Up to one-loop order of perturbation theory, we\nstudy the difference between the full and the effective theory in the continuum\nlimit. In the full theory we find a term non-analytic in 1/m, revealing the\nasymptotic character of the 1/m-expansion. In general, deviations from the\nm-to-infinity limit turn out to be small and are well described by the first\nnon-trivial terms when m is a factor 2-3 above the external scale. We also\ninvestigate the mass dependence of discretization errors, and find that the\nbehaviour of the correlation functions at finite lattice spacing differs\nsignificantly from that in the continuum limit when the quark mass is large.\n", "  If the expression of the topological charge density operator, suggested by\nfermions obeying the Ginsparg--Wilson relation, is employed, it is possible to\nprove on the lattice the validity of the Witten--Veneziano formula for the\n$\\eta'$ mass. Recent numerical results from simulations with overlap fermions\nin 2 (abelian Schwinger model) and 4 (QCD) dimensions give values for the mass\nof the lightest pseudo-scalar flavour-singlet state that agree with theoretical\nexpectations and/or experimental data.\n", "  We point out that chiral transformation properties of penguin operators\nchange in the transition from unquenched to (partially) quenched QCD. The way\nin which this affects the lattice determination of weak matrix elements can be\nunderstood in the framework of (partially) quenched chiral perturbation theory.\n", "  Lattice QCD allows a first-principles study of QCD with the freedom to vary\nthe number and masses of the quarks. I present results on the flavour singlet\ncorrelations (this illuminates OZI violating effects) for mesons. Concentrating\non the pseudoscalar mesons, the flavour singlet mass splitting ($\\eta$, $\\eta'$\nmass splitting) appears naturally.\n  I also present results on an investigation of decay constants for the $\\eta$\nand $\\eta'$ ($f_{\\eta}$) and discuss which quantities may be accessible in\nfuture lattice studies.\n  The Witten-Veneziano approach can also be explored by determining the\nquenched topological susceptibility on a lattice.\n", "  Chiral perturbation theory gives direct and unambiguous predictions for the\nform of various two-point hadronic correlators at low momentum in terms of a\nfinite set of couplings in a chiral Lagrangian. In this paper we study the\nfeasibility of extracting the couplings in the chiral Lagrangian (through\n1-loop order) by fitting two-point correlators computed in lattice QCD to the\npredicted chiral form. The correlators are computed using a pseudofermion\ntechnique yielding all-point quark propagators which allows the computation of\nthe full four-momentum transform of the two-point functions to be obtained\nwithout sacrificing any of the physical content of the unquenched gauge\nconfigurations used. Results are given for an ensemble of dynamical\nconfigurations generated using the truncated determinant algorithm on a large\ncoarse lattice. We also present a new analysis of finite volume effects based\non a finite volume dimensional regularization scheme which preserves the\npower-counting rules appropriate for a chiral Lagrangian.\n", "  Numerical evaluation of the overlap Dirac operator is difficult since it\ncontains the sign function $\\epsilon(H_w)$ of the Hermitian Wilson-Dirac\noperator $H_w$ with a negative mass term. The problems are due to $H_w$ having\nvery small eigenvalues on the equilibrium background configurations generated\nin current day Monte Carlo simulations. Since these are a consequence of the\nlattice discretisation and do not occur in the continuum version of the\noperator, we investigate in this paper to what extent the numerical evaluation\nof the overlap can be accelerated by making the Wilson-Dirac operator more\ncontinuum-like. Specifically, we study the effect of including the clover term\nin the Wilson-Dirac operator and smearing the link variables in the irrelevant\nterms. In doing so, we have obtained a factor of two speedup by moving from the\n  Wilson action to a FLIC (Fat Link Irrelevant Clover) action as the overlap\nkernel.\n", "  We discuss the allowed decays of a hybrid meson in the heavy quark limit. We\ndeduce that an important decay will be into a heavy quark non-hybrid state and\na light quark meson, in other words, the de-excitation of an excited gluonic\nstring by emission of a light quark-antiquark pair.\n  We discuss the study of hadronic decays from the lattice in the heavy quark\nlimit and apply this approach to explore the transitions from a spin-exotic\nhybrid to $\\chi_b \\eta$ and $\\chi_b S$ where $S$ is a scalar meson. We obtain a\nsignal for the transition emitting a scalar meson and we discuss the\nphenomenological implications.\n", "  A perturbative study of a general class of lattice Dirac operators is\nreported, which is based on an algebraic realization of the Ginsparg-Wilson\nrelation in the form\n  $\\gamma_{5}(\\gamma_{5}D)+(\\gamma_{5}D)\\gamma_{5} =\n  2a^{2k+1}(\\gamma_{5}D)^{2k+2}$ where $k$ stands for a non-negative integer.\nThe choice $k=0$ corresponds to the commonly discussed Ginsparg-Wilson relation\nand thus to the overlap operator. We study one-loop fermion contributions to\nthe self-energy of the gauge field, which are related to the fermion\ncontributions to the one-loop $\\beta$ function and to the Weyl anomaly. We\nfirst explicitly demonstrate that the Ward identity is satisfied by the\nself-energy tensor. By performing careful analyses, we then obtain the correct\nself-energy tensor free of infra-red divergences, as a general consideration of\nthe Weyl anomaly indicates. This demonstrates that our general operators give\ncorrect chiral and Weyl anomalies. In general, however, the Wilsonian effective\naction, which is supposed to be free of infra-red complications, is expected to\nbe essential in the analyses of our general class of Dirac operators for\ndynamical gauge field.\n", "  Using quenched reduction, we propose a method for the numerical calculation\nof meson correlation functions in the planar limit of QCD. General features of\nthe approach are outlined, and an example is given in the context of\ntwo-dimensional QCD.\n", "  The CP symmetry is not manifestly implemented for the local and doubler-free\nGinsparg-Wilson operator in lattice chiral gauge theory. We precisely identify\nwhere the effects of this CP breaking appear. We show that they appear in: (I)\nOverall constant phase of the fermion generating functional. (II) Overall\nconstant coefficient of the fermion generating functional. (III) Fermion\npropagator appearing in external fermion lines and the propagator connected to\nYukawa vertices. The first effect appears from the transformation of the path\nintegral measure and it is absorbed into a suitable definition of the constant\nphase factor for each topological sector; in this sense there appears no ``CP\nanomaly''. The second constant arises from the explicit breaking in the action\nand it is absorbed by the suitable weights with which topological sectors are\nsummed. The last one in the propagator is inherent to this formulation and\ncannot be avoided by a mere modification of the projection operator, for\nexample, in the framework of the Ginsparg-Wilson operator. This breaking\nemerges as an (almost) contact term in the propagator when the Higgs field,\nwhich is treated perturbatively, has no vacuum expectation value. In the\npresence of the vacuum expectation value, however, a completely new situation\narises and the breaking becomes intrinsically non-local, though this breaking\nmay still be removed in a suitable continuum limit. This non-local CP breaking\nis expected to persist for a non-perturbative treatment of the Higgs coupling.\n", "  We derive Ginsparg-Wilson relation for a lattice chiral symmetry in theories\nwith self-interacting fermions. Auxiliary scalar and pseudo-scalar fields are\nintroduced on a coarse lattice to give an effective description of the\nfermionic interactions. We obtain particular solutions to the Ginsparg-Wilson\nrelation and other\n  Ward-Takahashi identities in a closed form. These non-perturbative solutions\ncan be used to construct a chiral invariant action and an invariant\npath-integral measure on the coarse lattice. The resulting partition function\nexhibits the exact chiral symmetry in the fermionic system with the auxiliary\nfields.\n", "  Recent studies of the topological properties of a general class of lattice\nDirac operators are reported. This is based on a specific algebraic realization\nof the Ginsparg-Wilson relation in the form\n  $\\gamma_{5}(\\gamma_{5}D)+(\\gamma_{5}D)\\gamma_{5} =\n  2a^{2k+1}(\\gamma_{5}D)^{2k+2}$ where $k$ stands for a non-negative integer.\nThe choice $k=0$ corresponds to the commonly discussed Ginsparg-Wilson relation\nand thus to the overlap operator. It is shown that local chiral anomaly and the\ninstanton-related index of all these operators are identical. The locality of\nall these Dirac operators for vanishing gauge fields is proved on the basis of\nexplicit construction, but the locality with dynamical gauge fields has not\nbeen established yet. We suggest that the Wilsonian effective action is\nessential to avoid infrared singularities encountered in general perturbative\nanalyses.\n", "  We consider the SU(2) lattice gauge model and investigate numerically the\ncontinuum limit of the simple center vortices which are singular configurations\nof the gauge fields. We found that the vortices remain alive in the continuum\ntheory. Also we investigate the Creutz ratio and found that for all $\\beta$ it\nvanishes for those field configurations which do not contain the simple center\nvortices inside the considered Wilson loop. It leads us to the conclusion that\nthese singular field configurations play a real role in the continuum theory.\n", "  Maximal Abelian gauge fixing and subsequent Abelian projection of SU(2)\nlattice gauge theory defines closed trajectories of magnetic monopoles. These\ntrajectories can be interpreted in terms of an effective scalar field theory of\nthe MAG monopoles using the worldline representation of the functional\ndeterminants. Employing the monopole worldlines detected in the numerical\nsimulation, we show that a scalar bound state exists. The screening mass $m$ of\nthis state properly scales towards the continuum limit. We find m ~ 1.3 $GeV\nwhen the string tension sigma = 440 MeV is used as reference scale.\n", "  An algorithm to simulate full QCD with 3 colours at nonzero chemical\npotential on the lattice is proposed. The algorithm works for small values of\nthe chemical potential and can be used to extract expectation values of CPT\ninvariant operators.\n", "  The two-dimensional O(3) model at a vacuum angle theta=pi is investigated.\nThis model has a severe sign problem. By a Wolff cluster algorithm an integer\nor half-integer topological charge is assigned to each cluster. The meron\nclusters (clusters with half-integer topological charge) are used to construct\nan improved estimator for the correlation function of two spins at theta=pi.\nOnly configurations with 0 and 2 merons contribute to this correlation\nfunction.\n  An algorithm, that generates configurations with only 0 and 2 merons, is\nconstructed and numerical simulations at theta=pi are performed.\n  The numerical results indicate the presence of long range correlations at\ntheta=pi.\n", "  We re-examine the theoretical uncertainty in the Standard Model expression\nfor $B^0$-$\\bar{B}^0$ mixing. We focus on lattice calculations of the ratio\n$\\xi$, needed to relate the oscillation frequency of $B^0_s$-$\\bar{B}^0_s$\nmixing to $V_{td}$. We replace the usual linear chiral extrapolation with one\nthat includes the logarithm that appears in chiral perturbation theory. We find\na significant shift in the ratio $\\xi$, from the conventional $1.15\\pm0.05$ to\n$\\xi=1.32\\pm0.10$.\n", "  We present the inconsistencies which arise in quenched QCD in $\\Delta I=1/2$\nnon-leptonic kaon decays using chiral perturbation theory (ChPT) to one loop.\nIn particular we discuss how the lack of unitarity of the quenched theory\ninvalidates the usual methods for the extraction of matrix elements from\ncorrelation functions.\n", "  We study N_f=2 lattice QCD with nonperturbatively improved Wilson fermions at\nfinite temperature on 16^3 \\cdot 8 lattices. We determine the transition\ntemperature at m_{\\pi}/m_{\\rho} \\sim 0.8 and lattice spacing as small as\n0.12fm. The string breaking at T < T_c is also studied. We find that the static\npotential can be fitted by a simple expression involving string model potential\nat finite temperature.\n", "  We show that the dual Abrikosov vortex between quark and antiquark in Abelian\nProjected SU(2) gauge theory is insensitive to truncation of all loops except\nthe large monopole cluster noted by Hart and Teper. As the transverse distance\nincreases, the discrepancy decreases, suggesting that the London penetration\ndepth determined by the tail is invariant under the truncation of short loops.\n", "  I present one-loop perturbative calculations of matching coefficients between\nmatrix elements in continuum regulated QCD and lattice QCD with overlap\nfermions, with emphasis a recently-proposed variant discretization of the\noverlap. These fermions have extended (``fat link'') gauge connections. The\nscale for evaluation of the running coupling constant (in the context of the\nLepage-Mackenzie fixing scheme) is also given.\n  A variety of results (for additive mass renormalization, local currents, and\nsome non-penguin four-fermion operators) for naive, Wilson, clover, and overlap\nactions are shown.\n", "  We perform the careful study of the Gribov copies problem in SU(2) lattice\ngauge theory for maximal direct and maximal indirect center projections. We\nfind that this problem is much more severe than it was thought before. The\nprojected string tension is not in agreement with the physical string tension.\nWe also show that the particle--like objects, nexuses, might be important for\nthe confinement dynamics.\n", "  The chiral properties of lattice fermions can be improved by altering either\ntheir fermion-gauge coupling or the pure gauge part of the action (or both).\n  Using both perturbation theory and nonperturbative simulation, we compare a\nsimple alteration of the gauge action (which encompasses the Wilson, Symanzik,\nIwasaki, and DBW2 actions), and HYP-blocked links in the fermion action.\nPerturbative tests include calculations of the potential, flavor-changing quark\nscattering amplitudes, and matching factors for currents. Non-perturbative\ntests include the potential, measurements of flavor symmetry breaking for\nstaggered fermions, the behavior of topological objects, and properties of\noverlap actions. Our results display the bad properties of these actions as\nwell as their good ones.\n", "  Using two-color lattice QCD with Wilson fermions, we report a study of the\nfinite baryon number density system with two-flavors. First we investigate the\nPolyakov line and thermodynamical uantities in the $(\\kappa,\\mu)$ plane, where\n$\\kappa$ and $\\mu$ are the hopping parameter and chemical potential in the\nfermion action, respectively. Then we calculate propagators of meson\n($\\bar{q}\\Gamma q$) and baryon ($q\\Gamma q$) states. We find that the vector\nmeson propagators are strongly modified in large $\\mu$ regions, indicating the\nreduction of the mass. This anomalous behavior of the vector meson is observed\nfor the first time in lattice QCD.\n", "  The finite temperature lattice QCD with N_f=2 nonperturbatively improved\nWilson fermions is studied on 16^3 8 lattice. Using abelian projection after\nfixing to MA gauge we determine the transition temperature for m_{\\pi}/m_{\\rho}\n\\sim 0.8.\n", "  Numerical and theoretical evidence leads us to propose the following: Three\ndimensional Euclidean Yang-Mills theory in the planar limit undergoes a phase\ntransition on a torus of side $l=l_c$. For $l>l_c$ the planar limit is\n$l$-independent, as expected of a non-interacting string theory. We expect the\nsituation in four dimensions to be similar.\n", "  We compute charm and bottom quark masses in the quenched approximation and in\nthe continuum limit of lattice QCD. We make use of a step scaling method,\npreviously introduced to deal with two scale problems, that allows to take the\ncontinuum limit of the lattice data. We determine the RGI quark masses and make\nthe connection to the MSbar scheme. The continuum extrapolation gives us a\nvalue m_b^{RGI} = 6.73(16) GeV for the b-quark and m_c^{RGI} = 1.681(36) GeV\nfor the c-quark, corresponding respectively to m_b^{MSbar}(m_b^{MSbar}) =\n4.33(10) GeV and m_c^{MSbar}(m_c^{MSbar}) = 1.319(28) GeV. The latter result,\nin agreement with current estimates, is for us a check of the method. Using our\nresults on the heavy quark masses we compute the mass of the Bc meson, M_{Bc} =\n6.46(15) GeV.\n", "  The potential between a static quark and antiquark in pure SU(3) Yang-Mills\ntheory is evaluated non-perturbatively through computations on the lattice in\nthe region from short to intermediate distances (0.05 fm < r < 0.8 fm). In the\nhigh energy regime the results are compared with the parameter-free prediction\nof perturbation theory obtained by solving the Renormalization Group equation\nat two and three loops. The choice of the renormalization scheme to define a\nrunning coupling turns out to be important for the accuracy of the perturbative\nprediction: by obtaining the running coupling through the force, perturbation\ntheory is applicable up to alpha ~ 0.3, while from the static potential only up\nto alpha ~ 0.15. In the region where perturbation is supposed to be reliable,\nno large unexpected non-perturbative term is observed.\n  In the second part of this work, universality and scaling behavior of\ndifferent formulations of Yang-Mills theory on the lattice are discussed, in\nparticular the Iwasaki and DBW2 actions. The deconfinement temperature T_c*r0\nand the glueball masses (m_0++)*r0, (m_2++)*r0 are analyzed. Particular\nattention is dedicated to the violation of physical positivity which occur in\nthese actions and the consequences in the extraction of physical quantities\nfrom Euclidean correlation functions.\n", "  Calorons in the confined phase for SU(n) gauge theory, having a non-trivial\nPolyakov loop, \"dissolve\" in n monopole constituents for large enough instanton\nscale parameters. We discuss recent results for these caloron solutions and\ntheir fermion zero-modes, as well as the implications for lattice studies and\ncomment on the possible influence of the constituent monopoles on the instanton\nsize distribution.\n", "  We discuss how to formulate a staggered chiral perturbation theory. This\namounts to a generalization of the Lee-Sharpe Lagrangian to include more than\none flavor (i.e. multiple staggered fields), which turns out to be nontrivial.\nOne loop corrections to pion and kaon masses and decay constants are computed\nas examples in three cases: the quenched, partially quenched, and full\n(unquenched) case. The results for the one loop mass and decay constant\ncorrections have already been presented in Ref. [1].\n", "  The properties of the momentum space quark propagator in Landau gauge are\nexamined for the overlap quark action in quenched lattice QCD. Numerical\ncalculations are done on three lattices with different lattice spacings and\nsimilar physical volumes to explore the approach of the quark propagator\ntowards the continuum limit. We have calculated the nonperturbative\nmomentum-dependent wavefunction renormalization function $Z(p^2)$ and the\nnonperturbative mass function $M(p^2)$ for a variety of bare quark masses and\nextrapolate to the chiral limit.\n  We find the behavior of $Z(p^2)$ and $M(p^2)$ are in good agreement for the\ntwo finer lattices in the chiral limit. The quark condensate is also\ncalculated.\n", "  Dimensional reduction is a key issue in finite temperature field theory. For\nexample, when following the QCD Free Energy from low to high scales across the\ncritical temperature, ultrasoft degrees of freedom can be captured by a 3d\nSU(3) pure gauge theory. For such a theory a complete perturbative matching\nrequires four loop computations, which we undertook by means of Numerical\nStochastic Perturbation Theory. We report on the computation of the pure gauge\nplaquette in 3d, and in particular on the extraction of the logarithmic\ndivergence at order g^8, which had already been computed in the continuum.\n", "  We report on progress in our study of high temperature QCD with three flavors\nof improved staggered quarks. Simulations are being carried out with three\ndegenerate quarks with masses less than or equal to the strange quark mass,\n$m_s$, and with degenerate up and down quarks with masses in the range $0.1 m_s\n\\leq m_{u,d}\\leq 0.6 m_s$, and the strange quark mass fixed near its physical\nvalue. For the quark masses studied to date we find rapid crossovers, which\nsharpen as the quark mass is reduced, rather than bona fide phase transitions.\n", "  Noncommutativity between a differential form and a function allows us to\ndefine differential operator satisfying Leibniz's rule on a lattice. We propose\na new associative Clifford product defined on the lattice by introducing the\nnoncommutative differential forms. We show that this Clifford product naturally\nleads to the Dirac-K\\\"ahler fermion on the lattice.\n", "  In Monte Carlo simulation, lattice field theory with a $\\theta$ term suffers\nfrom the sign problem.\n  This problem can be circumvented by Fourier-transforming the topological\ncharge distribution $P(Q)$. Although this strategy works well for small lattice\nvolume, effect of errors of\n  $P(Q)$ becomes serious with increasing volume and prevents one from studying\nthe phase structure. This is called flattening. As an alternative approach, we\napply the maximum entropy method (MEM) to the Gaussian $P(Q)$. It is found that\nthe flattening could be much improved by use of the MEM.\n", "  I discuss strategies to determine hadronic decay couplings from lattice\nstudies.\n  As a check of the methods, I explore the decay of a vector meson to two\npseudoscalar mesons with $N_f=2$ flavours of sea quark. Although we are working\nwith quark masses that do not allow a physical decay, I show how the transition\nrate can be evaluated from the amplitude for $\\rho \\to \\pi \\pi$ and from the\nannihilation component of $\\pi \\pi \\to \\pi \\pi$. I explore the decay amplitude\nfor two different pion momenta and find consistent results. The coupling\nstrength found is in agreement with experiment. I also find evidence for a\nshift in the $\\rho$ mass caused by mixing with two pion states.\n  I also present results for the decay of a hybrid meson, for the case of heavy\nvalence quarks.\n", "  The chiral limit of finite-volume QCD is the $\\epsilon$-regime of the theory.\nWe discuss how this regime can be used for determining low-energy observables\nof QCD by means of comparisons between lattice simulations and quenched and\nunquenched chiral perturbation theory. The quenched theory suffers in the\n$\\epsilon$-regime from ``quenched finite volume logs'', the finite-volume\nanalogs of quenched chiral logs.\n", "  We perform numerical studies of the running coupling constant alpha_R(p^2)\nand of the gluon and ghost propagators for pure SU(2) lattice gauge theory in\nthe minimal Landau gauge. Different definitions of the gauge fields and\ndifferent gauge-fixing procedures are used respectively for gaining better\ncontrol over the approach to the continuum limit and for a better understanding\nof Gribov-copy effects. We find that the ghost-ghost-gluon-vertex\nrenormalization constant is finite in the continuum limit, confirming earlier\nresults by all-order perturbation theory. In the low momentum regime, the gluon\nform factor is suppressed while the ghost form factor is divergent.\nCorrespondingly, the ghost propagator diverges faster than 1/p^2 and the gluon\npropagator appears to be finite. Precision data for the running coupling\nalpha_R(p^2) are obtained. These data are consistent with an IR fixed point\ngiven by lim_{p \\to 0} alpha_R(p^2) = 5(1).\n", "  We study the difficulties associated with detecting chiral singularities\npredicted by chiral perturbation theory (ChPT) in lattice QCD. We focus on the\nphysics of the remnant O(2) chiral symmetry of staggered fermions in the strong\ncoupling limit using the recently discovered directed path algorithm. Since it\nis easier to look for power-like singularities as compared to logarithmic ones,\nour calculations are performed at a fixed finite temperature in the chirally\nbroken phase. We show that the behavior of the chiral condensate, the pion mass\nand the pion decay constant, for small masses, are all consistent with the\npredictions of ChPT.\n  However, the values of the quark masses that we need to demonstrate this are\nmuch smaller than those being used in dynamical QCD simulations. We also need\nto use higher order terms in the chiral expansion to fit our data.\n", "  A finite size scaling theory for the partition function zeros and\nthermodynamic functions of O(N) phi^4-theory in four dimensions is derived from\nrenormalization group methods. The leading scaling behaviour is mean-field like\nwith multiplicative logarithmic corrections which are linked to the triviality\nof the theory. These logarithmic corrections are independent of N for odd\nthermodynamic quantities and associated zeros and are N dependent for the even\nones. Thus a numerical study of finite size scaling in the Ising model serves\nas a non-perturbative test of triviality of phi^4_4-theories for all N.\n", "  A variant of the Nielsen--Ninomiya no-go theorem is formulated. This theorem\nstates that, under several assumptions, it is impossible to write down a\ndoubler-free Euclidean lattice action of a single Majorana fermion in $8k$ and\n$8k+1$ dimensions.\n", "  We investigate the influence of the granularity of the lattice on the\npotential between monopoles. Using the flux definition of monopoles we\nintroduce their centers of mass and are able to realize continuous shifts of\nthe monopole positions. We find periodic deviations from the $1/r$-behavior of\nthe monopole-antimonopole potential leading to local extrema. We suppose that\nthese meta-stabilities may influence the order of the phase transition in\ncompact QED.\n", "  A $\\theta$ term in lattice field theory causes the sign problem in Monte\nCarlo simulations. This problem can be circumvented by Fourier-transforming the\ntopological charge distribution $P(Q)$. This strategy, however, has a\nlimitation, because errors of $P(Q)$ prevent one from calculating the partition\nfunction\n  ${\\cal Z}(\\theta)$ properly for large volumes. This is called flattening. As\nan alternative approach to the Fourier method, we utilize the maximum entropy\nmethod (MEM) to calculate ${\\cal Z}(\\theta)$. We apply the MEM to Monte Carlo\ndata of the CP$^3$ model. It is found that in the non-flattening case, the\nresult of the MEM agrees with that of the Fourier transform, while in the\nflattening case, the MEM gives smooth\n  ${\\cal Z}(\\theta)$.\n", "  It is shown numerically that the Coulomb self-energy of an isolated, color\nnon-singlet source diverges in an infinite volume. This is in accord with the\nGribov Horizon scenario of confinement advocated by Gribov and Zwanziger. It is\nalso shown that this divergence can be attributed to the presence of center\nvortices in thermalized lattice configurations.\n", "  In this proceeding we propose a new procedure to impose the Schroedinger\nfunctional Dirichlet boundary condition on the overlap Dirac operator and the\ndomain-wall fermion using an orbifolding projection.\n  With this procedure the zero mode problem with Dirichlet boundary condition\ncan easily be avoided.\n", "  We present determinations of the B meson decay constant f_B and of the ratio\nf_{B_s}/f_B using the MILC collaboration unquenched gauge configurations which\ninclude three flavors of light sea quarks. The mass of one of the sea quarks is\nkept around the strange quark mass, and we explore a range in masses for the\ntwo lighter sea quarks down to m_s/8.\n  The heavy b quark is simulated using Nonrelativistic QCD, and both the\nvalence and sea light quarks are represented by the highly improved (AsqTad)\nstaggered quark action.\n  The good chiral properties of the latter action allow for a much smoother\nchiral extrapolation to physical up and down quarks than has been possible in\nthe past. We find f_B = 216(9)(19)(4) (6) MeV and f_{B_s} /f_B = 1.20(3)(1).\n", "  Using a quantum mechanical model, the exact energy eigenstates for\ntwo-particle two-channel scattering are studied in a cubic box with periodic\nboundary conditions.\n  A relation between the exact energy eigenvalue in the box and the two-channel\n$S$-matrix elements in the continuum is obtained. This result can be viewed as\na generalization of the well-known L\\\"uscher's formula which establishes a\nsimilar relation in elastic scattering.\n", "  We present a study of the systematic effects in the nonperturbative\nevaluation of the renormalization constants which appear in the\nfield-theoretical determination of the topological susceptibility in pure\nYang-Mills theory. The study is performed by computing the renormalization\nconstants on configurations that have been calibrated by use of the\nGinsparg-Wilson formalism and by cooling.\n", "  QED3 with fermi and gap anisotropies is considered to be a candidate\neffective field theory of high temperature superconductors. Simulations of a\nvariant of the theory have demonstrated that there is evidence consistent with\na phase transition to a chirally restored phase as the velocity anisotropy\nincreases, and that the correlation lengths of pions in spatial directions\nbehave in a manner consistent with the anisotropy being a relevant parameter of\nthe theory. We present the first measurements of the fermion propagator in\nLandau gauge for this theory and suggest that the structure of this theory is\nmore complex than previously thought.\n", "  We compute, to two loops in pertubation theory, the fermionic contribution to\nrectangular RxT Wilson loops, for different values of R and T.\n  We use the overlap fermionic action. We also employ the clover action, for\ncomparison with existing results in the literature.\n  In the limit R, T -> Infinity our results lead to the shift in the b-quark\nmass. We also evaluate the perturbative static potential as T -> Infinity.\n", "  We compute, to two loops in pertubation theory, the fermionic contribution to\nrectangular RxT Wilson loops, for different values of R and T.\n  We use the overlap fermionic action. We also employ the clover action, for\ncomparison with existing results in the literature.\n  In the limit R, T -> Infinity our results lead to the shift in the b-quark\nmass. We also evaluate the perturbative static potential as T -> Infinity.\n", "  We present a new study of SU(3)-breaking corrections in hyperon vector form\nfactors relevant for the extraction of Vus. A lattice quenched simulation has\nbeen performed, showing that it is possible to reach the required precision to\nextract SU(3)-breaking corrections in the regime of simulated masses. In order\nto perform the chiral extrapolation we calculated the chiral corrections to the\nvector form factor in HBChPT. Besides the one-loop O(p^2) contribution, we\nincluded also the subleading O(p^3) and O(1/M_B) corrections that, due to the\nAdemollo-Gatto theorem, are free from the contamination of unknown low energy\nconstants. The results complete and correct previous calculations, and show\nthat subleading corrections cannot be neglected. We also studied decuplet\ncontributions within HBChPT and show that, in this case, the chiral expansion\nbreaks down, rising doubts on the consistency of the theory.\n", "  In the high-temperature phase of QCD meson spectral functions at nonzero\nmomentum are expected to have a nontrivial and interesting structure. In order\nto provide a reference point for lattice studies employing e.g. the Maximal\nEntropy Method, we discuss several characteristics of meson spectral functions\nin the infinite-temperature limit. We report on ongoing work in quenched QCD\nwith staggered fermions.\n", "  I review the recent status of lattice QCD calculations at non-zero density.\n", "  We study numerically the eigenmode spectrum of the covariant lattice\nLaplacian, in the fundamental SU(2) color group representation. It is found\nthat eigenmodes at the lower and upper ends of the spectrum are localized, and\nthat the localization volume scales. In contrast, the eigenmodes of the lattice\nFaddeev-Popov operator are all extended rather than localized (as required for\nconfinement) despite the similarity of the kinetic and Faddeev-Popov operators.\n", "  Some past and ongoing explorations of the spectrum of QCD using Monte Carlo\nsimulations on a space-time lattice are described. Glueball masses in the\npure-gauge theory are reviewed, and the energies of gluonic excitations in the\npresence of a static quark-antiquark pair are discussed. Current efforts to\ncompute the baryon spectrum using extended three-quark operators are also\npresented, emphasizing the need to use irreducible representations of the cubic\npoint group to identify spin quantum numbers in the continuum limit.\n", "  The type of the vacuum is studied numerically in the maximally Abelian (MA)\ngauge and in the Landau (LA) gauge of SU(2) gluodynamics. The type of the\nvacuum is determined by a ratio between the dual coherence and the dual\npenetration lengths. The dual penetration length is determined from\ncorrelations between Wilson loops and electric fields in both gauges. The dual\ncoherence length is found from correlations between Wilson loops and\ndimension-2 operators both in the MA and the LA gauges. This determination of\nthe coherence length is supported by theoretical and numerical observation that\nthe dimension-2 gluon operators in the studied gauges have a strong correlation\nwith the monopole current determined in the MA gauge. We find numerically that\nthe dual penetration lengths and the dual coherence lengths in the LA and the\nMA gauges are almost the same. Therefore we conclude, that in both gauges the\ntype of the vacuum in the confinement phase is near to the border between the\ntype 1 and the type 2 dual superconductors.\n", "  We simulate 3-flavour lattice QCD at finite temperature and isospin chemical\npotential $\\mu_I$. In particular we study the nature of the finite temperature\ntransition for quark masses close to the critical mass at which this transition\nfor zero chemical potentials changes from a first order transition to a\ncrossover. We find that the Binder cumulants, used to determine the position of\nthis transition, have very strong dt dependence. This leads us to an estimate\nof the critical mass which is about 20% below previous estimates. In addition,\nwhen this dt dependence is taken into account, we find that the Binder\ncumulants show very little dependence on mu_I. From this we conclude that we do\nnot as yet see any evidence for the expected critical endpoint. We have argued\npreviously that the position and nature of the finite temperature transition\nfor small mu_I should be the same as that for small quark-number chemical\npotential mu.\n", "  Born-Infeld non-linear electrodynamics was introduced to render the self\nenergy of a point particle finite. It has recently been revived as a field\ntheory for branes and strings. We quantize this theory on a Euclidean\nspace-time lattice, using Metropolis Monte-Carlo simulations to measure the\nproperties of the quantum field theory. Luscher-Weisz methods are used to\nmeasure the electromagnetic fields from a static point charge. The D field from\na point charge appears to be identical to that for the normal Maxwell\nLagrangian. The E field is enhanced by quantum fluctuations, and shows short\ndistance screening as it does in the classical theory.\n", "  We review the architecture of massively parallel machines used for lattice\nQCD simulations and present benchmarks for the performance of popular\nalgorithms on these platforms. We cover commercial supercomputers, PC clusters,\nand custom-designed machines. We also speculate on future developments.\n", "  We study the phase transition of the three-dimensional complex |psi|^4 theory\nby considering the geometrically defined vortex-loop network as well as the\nmagnetic properties of the system in the vicinity of the critical point. Using\nhigh-precision Monte Carlo techniques we examine an alternative formulation of\nthe geometrical excitations in relation to the global O(2)-symmetry breaking,\nand check if both of them exhibit the same critical behavior leading to the\nsame critical exponents and therefore to a consistent description of the phase\ntransition. Different percolation observables are taken into account and\ncompared with each other. We find that different definitions of constructing\nthe vortex-loop network lead to different results in the thermodynamic limit,\nand the percolation thresholds do not coincide with the thermodynamic phase\ntransition point.\n", "  Since the early days of QCD, it has been argued that inside hadrons quarks\norganise into substructures. Among those, popular pictures of various phenomena\n(including exotica and colour superconductivity) give a prominent role to\ndiquarks, i.e. to colour antitriplet combinations of two quarks. Using a\ngauge-invariant setup, which combines the diquark with a static quark, we study\nspatial correlations of the two light quarks inside the diquark. After\nillustrating the setup, we discuss our first results for both the scalar\n(``good'') and the spin one (``bad'') diquark channels. In a regime in which\n$m_{\\pi} \\simeq 830$ MeV, our data show unambiguously that a scalar diquark\nforms with a size of $\\simeq$ 0.9 fm. For the vector diquark we are able to put\na lower bound of 4.1(7) fm on its size. We also investigate the mass splitting\nbetween the good and the bad diquark; our findings are compatible with\nphenomenologically inspired predictions for this quantity.\n", "  We discuss a new approach to putting supersymmetric theories on the lattice.\nThe basic idea is to start from a {\\it twisted} formulation of the underlying\nsupersymmetric theory in which the fermions are represented as grassmann valued\nantisymmetric tensor fields. The original supersymmetry algebra is replaced by\na twisted algebra which contains a scalar nilpotent supercharge $Q$.\nFurthermore the action of the theory can then be written as the $Q$-variation\nof some function. The case of ${\\cal N}=2$ super Yang-Mills theory in two\ndimensions is discussed in some detail. We then present our proposal for\ndiscretizing this theory and derive the resultant lattice action. The latter is\nlocal, free of spectrum doubling, gauge invariant and preserves the scalar\nsupercharge invariance exactly. Some preliminary numerical results are then\npresented. The approach can be naturally generalized to yield a lattice action\nfor ${\\cal N}=4$ super Yang-Mills in four dimensions.\n", "  We study the chiral Gross-Neveu model with Wilson fermions. In the framework\nof the Schroedinger functional we show that in general not only the bare mass\nhas to be tuned to achieve chiral symmetry in the continuum, but also coupling\nconstants multiplying chirally non-invariant four fermion terms. The strategy\nfor fixing the parameters of the theory is explained in perturbation theory and\nthe results of a first order calculation are presented. The results are shown\nto agree with the infinite flavour limit.\n", "  We study the free energies of heavy quarks calculated from Polyakov loop\ncorrelation functions in full 2-flavour QCD using the p4-improved staggered\nfermion action. A small but finite Baryon number density is included via Taylor\nexpansion of the fermion determinant in the Baryo-chemical potential mu. For\ntemperatures above Tc we extract Debye screening masses from the large distance\nbehaviour of the free energies and compare their mu-dependence to perturbative\nresults.\n", "  We discuss how the peculiar properties of maximally twisted Wilson fermions\ncan be exploited to set up a consistent LQCD computational scheme in which the\nCP-conserving matrix elements of the $\\Delta S =1,2$ effective weak Hamiltonian\ncan be evaluated without mixing with wrong-chirality and/or -parity operators.\nThe proposed lattice framework guarantees automatic O($a$) improvement and\npositive determinant also for pairs of non-degenerate quarks.\n", "  Using the O(a) Symanzik improved action an estimate is given for the strange\nquark mass for unquenched (nf=2) QCD. The determination is via the axial Ward\nidentity (AWI) and includes a non-perturbative evaluation of the\nrenormalisation constant. Numerical results have been obtained at several\nlattice spacings, enabling the continuum limit to be taken. Results indicate a\nvalue for the strange quark mass (in the MSbar-scheme at a scale of 2GeV) in\nthe range 100 - 130MeV.\n", "  We study the high density region of QCD within an effective model obtained in\nthe frame of the hopping parameter expansion. The model still acknowledges the\nsign problem peculiar to non-zero chemical potential, but it permits the\ndevelopment of refined algorithms which ensure a good overlap of the Monte\nCarlo ensemble with the true one. We review the main features of the model,\nincluding the most explicit form of the resumed expansion, and present\ncalculations concerning the dependence of various observables on the chemical\npotential and on the temperature, in particular of the charge density and the\ndiquark susceptibility, which may be used to characterize the various phases\nexpected at high baryonic density.\n", "  We explore gauge actions for lattice QCD, which are constructed such that the\noccurrence of small plaquette values is strongly suppressed. Such actions\noriginate from the admissibility condition in order to conserve the topological\ncharge. The suppression of small plaquette values is expected to be\nadvantageous for numerical studies in the $\\epsilon$-regime and also for\nsimulations with dynamical quarks. Performing simulations at a lattice spacing\nof about 0.1 fm, we present numerical results for the static potential, the\nphysical scale $r_0$, the stability of the topological charge history, the\ncondition number of the kernel of the overlap operator and the acceptance rate\nagainst the step size in the local HMC algorithm.\n", "  We report on our search for Kraan-van Baal calorons in finite temperature\nSU(2) lattice ensembles. We also discuss recent progress made in developing a\ncaloron-anticaloron gas model decribing confinement and deconfinement in the\ncontext of trivial and non-trivial holonomy.\n", "  We present results for the pseudoscalar meson masses and decay constants on\n2+1 flavor DWF configurations with different sea quark masses and an inverse\nlattice spacing of 1.6(1) GeV, with a focus on chiral fits at small quark\nmasses. The calculation is done on 16^3x32x8 lattices generated with the DBW2\ngauge action.\n", "  A simulation of quenched QCD with the overlap Dirac operator has been carried\nout using 100 Wilson gauge configurations at beta = 6 on an 18^3 x 64 lattice\nand at beta = 5.85 on a 14^3 x 48 lattice. Here we present results for meson\nmasses, meson final state \"wave functions,\" decay constants, and other\nobservables, as well as details on our algorithmic and data analysis\ntechniques. We also summarize results for baryon masses and quark and diquark\npropagators in the Landau gauge.\n", "  The matching between Schrodinger Functional renormalization schemes and\nconventional perturbative schemes is usually done using an intermediate lattice\nscheme. We propose to do the matching directly. This requires the perturbative\nevaluation of Schrodinger Functional correlation functions in the continuum. We\nuse dimensional regularization but due to the lack of translational invariance\nin the Euclidean time direction, we employ a general technique introduced by\nLuscher. In this talk I describe this technique and its application to the\none-loop expansion of correlation functions used in the definition of the\nrenormalized quark mass in the Schrodinger Functional scheme. The divergent\nparts are identified and the computation of finite parts is in progress.\n", "  We report on progress in measuring disconnected correlators associated with\npseudoscalar flavor-singlet mesons. This will eventually allow us to compute\nthe masses of the eta and eta' mesons. Flavor-singlet physics also presents an\ninteresting test of the staggered fermion formulation, as disconnected\ncorrelators are sensitive to whether the same action governs both sea quarks\nand valence quarks. It can also help test the validity of the ``fourth-root\ntrick'' used in unquenched lattice calculations where the number of flavors\n$N_f<4$.\n", "  We present recent results for meson decay constants calculated on\nconfigurations with two flavours of O(a)-improved Wilson fermions.\nNon-perturbative renormalisation is applied and quark mass dependencies as well\nas finite volume and discretisation effects are investigated. In this work we\nalso present a computation of the coupling of the light vector mesons to the\ntensor current using dynamical fermions.\n", "  We present preliminary results using NRQCD to describe heavy quarks on the\nMILC 2+1 flavour dynamical extra coarse ensemble. We calculate the spectra of\nlow lying states in bottomonium to complement earlier results on the finer MILC\nensembles. We then exploit the coarseness of the lattices to calculate charm\npropagators using NRQCD. These are used to examine the charmonium spectrum and\nto calclate the mass of the $B_c$ using NRQCD. Finally we look breifly at the\n$B_d$ and $B_s$ systems using the imporoved staggered formalism to describe the\nlight valence quarks.\n", "  Motivated by simulation results for octet and decuplet baryon masses using\n2+1 flavors of light staggered quarks, we are incorporating staggered lattice\nartifacts into heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory, calculating the masses\nof various staggered baryons, and studying the connection between the staggered\nbaryons of the chiral theory and the staggered baryons of simulations. We\npresent order (m_q)^(3/2) loop contributions to the masses of several staggered\nnucleons and discuss interpolating fields that create these states.\n", "  We present methods and results for the tuning of quark and gluon anisotropies\nfor improved actions in N_f = 2 QCD.\n", "  We review briefly recent results of lattice simulations on 3d domains in the\nvacuum state of SU(2) gluodynamics. The defects are defined as unification of\nall the negative links in central projection under condition that the total\nnumber of negative links is minimized. In the continuum limit, negative links\ncorrespond, generally speaking to singular fields. The data indicate that total\nvolume of the defects scales in physical units. We consider also correlator of\nnegative links. The correlator scales in physical units as well, within the\nerror bars. A new observation reported here is a strong anisotropy of the\ncorrelator.\n", "  We study charmonia correlators at finite temperature. We analyze to what\nextent heavy quarkonia correlators are sensitive to the effect of heavy quark\ntransport and whether it is possible to constrain the heavy quark diffusion\nconstant by lattice calculations. Preliminary lattice calculations of quarkonia\ncorrelators performed on anisotropic lattices show that they are sensitive to\nthe effect of heavy quark transport, but much detailed calculations are\nrequired to constrain the value of the heavy quark diffusion constant.\n", "  The signature of bound state formation on the lattice is of particular\ninterest in this talk. In the finite volume, where all states have discrete\nenergies, it is rather hard to distinguish between a bound state and a\nscattering state if the bound state were close to threshold, i.e., like a\n\"loosely bound state\". To study bound states in the finite volume, we calculate\nthe positronium spectroscopy in the Higgs phase of U(1) gauge dynamics, where\nthe photon is massive and then massive photons give rise to the short-ranged\ninterparticle force. We try to identify bound state formation on the basis of\nthe Luscher's finite size method, which suggests specific volume dependences of\nthe energy gap/shift from the threshold energy for either bound states or\nscattering states.\n", "  We present our preliminary results for three-point correlation functions\ninvolving the operators entering the $\\Delta{S}=1$ effective Hamiltonian with\nan active charm quark, obtained using overlap fermions in the quenched\napproximation. This is the first computation carried out for valence quark\nmasses small enough so as to permit a matching to Quenched Chiral Perturbation\nTheory in the $\\epsilon$-regime. The commonly observed large statistical\nfluctuations are tamed by means of low-mode averaging techniques, combined with\nrestrictions to individual topological sectors. We also discuss the matching of\nthe resulting hadronic matrix elements to the effective low-energy constants\nfor $\\Delta{S}=1$ transitions. This involves (a) finite-volume corrections\nwhich can be evaluated at NLO in Quenched Chiral Perturbation Theory, and (b)\nthe short-distance renormalization of the relevant four-quark operators in\ndiscretizations based on the overlap operator. We discuss perturbative\nestimates for the renormalization factors and possible strategies for their\nnon-perturbative evaluation. Our results can be used to isolate the\nlong-distance contributions to the $\\Delta I=1/2$ rule, coming from physics\neffects around the intrinsic QCD scale.\n", "  We present a high-precision numerical study of 3D random percolation viewed\nas a confining gauge theory. Using large correlation matrices among multiform\nWilson loops we determine the low-lying masses in various spin channels.\n", "  We present an exploratory study of the thermodynamics of $N_f=3$ QCD with an\nimproved staggered fermions using the QCDOC supercomputer. We use a p4 action\nwith MILC-style smeared links (Fat 7). Some details of the implementation of\nthe p4 action on QCDOC are discussed and performance benchmarks are given. We\nshow preliminary results for the quark mass dependence of the pseudo-critical\ntemperature $T_c$ from several lattice volumes . We also make a comparison\nbetween p4fat7 and the old p4 action.\n", "  We study the lattice model for the supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory in two\ndimensions proposed by Cohen, Kaplan, Katz, and Unsal. We re-examine the formal\nproof for the absence of susy breaking counter terms as well as the stability\nof the vacuum by an explicit perturbative calculation for the case of U(2)\ngauge group. Introducing fermion masses and treating the bosonic zero momentum\nmode nonperturbatively, we avoid the infra-red divergences in the perturbative\ncalculation. As a result, we find that there appear mass counter terms for\nfinite volume which vanish in the infinite volume limit so that the theory\nneeds no fine-tuning.\n", "  We give a short review of the recently obtained result that the magnetic\nmonopole promoted to the dyon due to the vacuum angle $\\theta$ resolves the\nU(1) problem in the sense that the dyon obtained in this way gives a dominant\ncontribution to the topological susceptibility\n", "  We present transport coefficients (shear viscosity, $\\eta$, and bulk\nviscosity, $\\zeta$) for the gluon system obtained by the lattice QCD. This is\nan indispensable calculation towards the understanding of ``New State of\nMatter'' observed in RHIC. We study the temperature regions of RHIC ($1.4 \\leq\nT/T_c \\leq 1.8$) and much higher ones up to $ T/T_c \\sim 20$. In RHIC regions,\nthe ratio of shear viscosity to entropy density, $\\eta/s$, is around $\\sim\n0.1-0.4$, and satisfies the KSS bound. At high temperature, $\\eta$ becomes two\nor three oder of magnitude larger. Our calculation has two limitations: (i) the\nuse of the quench approximation, i.e., without quark pair creation-annihilation\neffects on vacuum, and (ii) the use of an ansatz for the spectral function. The\nfirst point has been well studied in calculations of the spectroscopy and the\nphase-transition behavior. To investigate the second point, we compare our\nresults with perturbative calculations in high $T$-regions, and also check the\neffects of the modification of the spectral function on the viscosity.\n", "  Using D-theory we construct a new efficient cluster algorithm for the Ising\nmodel. The construction is very different from the standard Swendsen-Wang\nalgorithm and related to worm algorithms. With the new algorithm we have\nmeasured the correlation function with high precision over a surprisingly large\nnumber of orders of magnitude.\n", "  We report measurements of diagonal susceptibilities for the baryon number,\nchi_B, electrical charge, chi_Q, third component of isospin, chi_I,\nstrangeness, chi_S, and hypercharge, chi_Y, as well as the off-diagonal chi_BQ,\nchi_BY, chi_BS, etc. We show that the ratios of susceptibilities in the high\ntemperature phase are robust variables, independent of lattice spacing, and\ntherefore give predictions for experiments. We also investigate strangeness\nproduction and flavour symmetry breaking matrix elements at finite temperature.\nFinally, we present evidence that in the high temperature phase of QCD the\ndifferent flavour quantum numbers are excited in linkages which are exactly the\nsame as one expects from quarks. We present some investigations of these\nquark-like quasi particles.\n", "  Using non-perturbative techniques we have found the renormalisation factor,\nZ, in the RI-MOM scheme for quark bilinear operators in quenched QCD. We worked\nwith overlap fermions using the Luescher-Weisz gauge action. Our calculation\nwas performed at beta=8.45 at a lattice spacing of 1/a=2.1 GeV using a value of\nrho=1.4. Our results show good agreement between the vector and the axial\nvector in the zero mass limit. This shows that overlap fermions have good\nchiral properties. To attempt to improve the discretisation errors in our\nresults we subtracted the O(a^2) terms in one-loop lattice perturbation theory\nfrom the Monte Carlo Green functions. In particular we paid attention to the\noperators for the observable <x>. We found a value for the renormalisation\nconstants Z^msbar_(v_2b) and Z^msbar_(v_2a) just less than 1.9 at mu=1/a=2.1\nGeV.\n", "  We provide the analytic predictions for the flavor non-singlet scalar\ncorrelator, which will enable determination of the scalar meson mass from the\nlattice scalar correlator. We consider simulations with 2+1 staggered sea\nquarks and staggered or chiral valence quarks. At small u/d masses the\ncorrelator is dominated by the bubble contribution, which is the intermediate\nstate with two pseudoscalar mesons. We determine the bubble contribution within\nStaggered and Mixed Chiral Perturbation Theory.\n  Its effective mass is smaller than the mass M_pi+M_eta, which is the lightest\nintermediate state in proper 2+1 QCD. The unphysical effective mass is a\nconsequence of the taste breaking that makes possible the intermediate state\nwith mass 2*M_pi. We find that the scalar correlator can be negative in the\nsimulations with mixed quark actions if the sea and valence quark masses are\ntuned by matching the pion masses M_{val,val}=M_{pi_5}.\n", "  The sign problem is notorious in Monte\n  Carlo simulations of lattice QCD with the finite density, lattice field\ntheory (LFT) with a $\\theta$ term and quantum spin models. In this report, to\ndeal with the sign problem, we apply the maximum entropy method (MEM) to LFT\nwith the $\\theta$ term and investigate to what extent the\n  MEM is applicable to this issue. Based on this study, we also make a brief\ncomment about lattice QCD with the finite density in terms of the\n  MEM.\n", "  Lattice field theory with the $\\theta$ term suffers from the sign problem.\nThe sign problem appears as flattening of the free energy.\n  As an alternative to the conventional method, the Fourier transform method\n  (FTM), we apply the maximum entropy method (MEM) to Monte Carlo data obtained\nusing the CP$^3$ model with the $\\theta$ term.\n  For data without flattening, we obtain the most probable images of the\npartition function ${\\hat{\\cal Z}}(\\theta)$ with rather small errors. The\nresults are quantitatively close to the result obtained with the\n  FTM. Motivated by this fact, we systematically investigate flattening in\nterms of the MEM.\n  Obtained images ${\\hat{\\cal Z}}(\\theta)$ are consistent with the FTM for\nsmall values of $\\theta$, while the behavior of ${\\hat{\\cal Z}}(\\theta)$\ndepends strongly on the default model for large values of $\\theta$.\n  This behavior of ${\\hat{\\cal Z}}(\\theta)$ reflects the flattening phenomenon.\n", "  Lattice QCD with $N_f=2$ flavours of sea quark is used to explore the\nspectrum and decay of a $J^{PC}=1^{-+}$ spin-exotic hybrid meson.\n  We test lattice determination of S-wave decay amplitudes at threshold using\n$b_1 \\to \\pi \\omega$ where agreement with data is found. We find a hybrid meson\nstate at 2.2(2) GeV with a partial width to $\\pi b_1$ of 400(120) MeV and to\n$\\pi f_1$ of 90(60) MeV.\n", "  Static quark potential is studied using a tadpole improved gauge lattice\naction. The scale is set using the potential for a wide range of bare\nparameters.\n  The renormalized anisotropy of the lattice is also measured.\n", "  Finite volume renormalization scheme is one of the most fascinating scheme\nfor non-perturbative renormalization on lattice.\n  By using the step scaling function one can follow running of renormalized\nquantities with reasonable cost.\n  It has been established the Schroedinger functional is very convenient to\ndefine a field theory in a finite volume for the renormalization scheme.\n  The Schroedinger functional, which is characterized by a\n  Dirichlet boundary condition in temporal direction, is well defined and works\nwell for the Yang-Mills theory and QCD with the Wilson fermion.\n  However one easily runs into difficulties if one sets the same sort of the\nDirichlet boundary condition for the overlap Dirac operator or the domain-wall\nfermion.\n  In this paper we propose an orbifolding projection procedure to impose the\nSchroedinger functional Dirichlet boundary condition on the domain-wall\nfermion.\n", "  Lattice QCD with $N_f=2$ flavours of sea quark is used to explore the\nspectrum and decay of scalar mesons. We are able to determine the $b_1$ - $a_0$\nmass difference and this leads to the conclusion that the lightest non-singlet\nscalar meson ($a_0$) has a mass of 1.01(4) GeV. We determine from the lattice\nthe coupling strength to KK and $\\pi \\eta$. We compute the leptonic decay\nconstant of the lightest non-singlet scalar meson.\n  We discuss the impact of these lattice results on the interpretation of the\n$a_0(980)$ state. We also discuss $K^*_0$ states.\n", "  We formulate the massive domain wall fermions on anisotropic lattices.\n  For the massive domain wall fermion, we find that the dispersion relation\nassumes the usual form in the low momentum region when the bare parameters are\nproperly tuned. The quark self-energy and the quark field renormalization\nconstants are calculated to one-loop in bare lattice perturbation theory. For\nlight domain wall fermions, we verified that the chiral mode is stable against\nquantum fluctuations on anisotropic lattices. This calculation serves as a\nguidance for the tuning of the parameters in the quark action in future\nnumerical simulations.\n", "  Effects of the quark field on the ghost propagator of the lattice Landau\ngauge are investigated by using the quenched gauge configuration of SU(2) first\ncopy and the parallel tempering (PT) gauge fixed samples, quenched SU(3) $56^4$\nconfiguration and unquenched SU(3) configurations produced by the MILC\ncollaboration.\n  We measure color symmetric and color antisymmetric ghost propagator and the\nBinder cumulant of $l^1$ norm and $l^2$ norm of color antisymmetric ghost\npropagator and investigate deviation from that of Gaussian distribution.\n  The dynamical quarks make color antisymmetric ghost propagator closer to\nGaussian distribution and Kugo-Ojima color confinement parameter $c$ closer to\n1.\n", "  We give a short review of recently obtained results on a new lattice\nformulation of the non-linear change of variables which was once called the\nCho--Faddeev--Niemi decomposition in SU(2) Yang-Mills theory.\n  Based on this formulation, we proposed a new gauge-invariant definition of\nthe magnetic monopole current which guarantees the magnetic charge\nquantization. We also demonstrated the magnetic monopole dominance in the\nstring tension in SU(2) Yang-Mills theory on a lattice. Our formulation enables\none to reproduce in the gauge-invariant way remarkable results obtained so far\nonly in the Maximally Abelian gauge.\n", "  A definition of an effective meson-meson interaction adapted to the framework\nof a lattice simulation is presented. Results, based on a truncated\nmomentum-space 4-point time correlation matrix, and preliminary data from a\ncomplementary coordinate-space simulation, are shown.\n", "  In the continuum, the single flavor massless Schwinger model has an exact\nglobal axial $U(1)$ symmetry in the sector of perturbative gauge fields. This\nsymmetry is explicitly broken by gauge fields with nonzero topological charge\ninducing a nonzero expectation value for the bilinear $\\bar\\psi\\psi$. We show\nthat a lattice formulation of this model, using the overlap formalism to treat\nthe massless fermions, explicitly exhibits this phenomenon. A Monte Carlo\nsimulation of the complete system yields the correct value of the fermion\ncondensate and shows unambiguously that it originates from the sector of\ntopological charge equal to unity.\n", "  The finite temperature electroweak phase transition is studied on the\nlattice. The results of the simulations obtained by the 3-dimensional effective\ntheories and the 4-dimensional SU(2)-Higgs model are reviewed.\n", "  We calculate the solenoidal magnetic monopole current and electric flux\ndistributions at finite temperature in the presence of a static quark antiquark\npair. The simulation was performed using SU(2) lattice gauge theory in the\nmaximal Abelian gauge. We find that the monopole current and electric flux\ndistributions are quite different below and above the finite temperature\ndeconfining phase transition point and agree with predictions of the\nGinzburg-Landau effective theory.\n", "  We present results of an investigation into the nature of instantons in\n4-dimensional pure gauge lattice $SU(2)$\\ obtained from configurations which\nhave been cooled using an under-relaxed cooling algorithm. We discuss ways of\ncalibrating the cooling and the effects of different degrees of cooling, and\ncompare our data for the shapes, sizes and locations of instantons with\ncontinuum results. In this paper we extend the ideas and techniques developed\nby us for use in $O(3)$, and compare the results with those obtained by other\ngroups.\n", "  The problem of calculating multicanonical parameters recursively is\ndiscussed. I describe in detail a computational implementation which has worked\nreasonably well in practice.\n", "  Lattice fermions have well-known difficulties with chiral symmetry. To evade\nthem it is possible to couple continuum fermions to lattice gauge fields, by\nintroducing an interpolation of the latter. Following this line of thinking,\nthis paper presents two Euclidean formulations of the effective action that\nappears after functional integration over fermion fields, one for vector-like\nand the other for chiral couplings. With suitable finite-mode regulators both\neffective actions can be evaluated in a finite computation. The prescriptions\nprovided here contain some details not found in previous work marrying\ncontinuum fermions to the lattice via an interpolation. For example, the\ncounter-terms needed to maintain chiral gauge invariance are explicitly given.\nBy construction coupling-constant renormalization, anomaly structure, and (in\nthe chiral gauge theory) fermion nonconserving amplitudes all satisfy one's\nexpectations from perturbative and semi-classical analyses.\n", "  We calculate the potential between ``quarks'' which are in the adjoint\nrepresentation of SU(2) color in the three-dimensional lattice theory. We work\nin the scaling region of the theory and at large quark separations $R$. We also\ncalculate the masses $M_{Qg}$ of color-singlet bound states formed by coupling\nan adjoint quark to adjoint glue (``gluelumps''). Good scaling behavior is\nfound for the masses of both magnetic (angular momentum $J=0$) and electric\n($J=1$) gluelumps, and the magnetic gluelump is found to be the lowest-lying\nstate. It is naively expected that the potential for adjoint quarks should\nsaturate above a separation $R_{\\rm scr}$ where it becomes energetically\nfavorable to produce a pair of gluelumps. We obtain a good estimate of the\nnaive screening distance $R_{\\rm scr}$. However we find little evidence of\nsaturation in the potential out to separations $R$ of about twice $R_{\\rm\nscr}$.\n", "  In a recent paper we found strong evidence from simulations that the\nIsingantiferromagnet on ``thin'' random graphs - Feynman diagrams - displayed\namean-field spin glass transition. The intrinsic interest of considering such\nrandom graphs is that they give mean field results without long range\ninteractions or the drawbacks, arising from boundary problems, of the Bethe\nlattice. In this paper we reprise the saddle point calculations for the Ising\nand Potts ferromagnet, antiferromagnet and spin glass on Feynman diagrams. We\nuse standard results from bifurcation theory that enable us to treat an\narbitrary number of replicas and any quenched bond distribution. We note the\nagreement between the ferromagnetic and spin glass transition temperatures thus\ncalculated and those derived by analogy with the Bethe lattice, or in previous\nreplica calculations. We then investigate numerically spin glasses with a plus\nor minus J bond distribution for the Ising and Q=3,4,10,50 state Potts models,\npaying particular attention to the independence of the spin glass transition\nfrom the fraction of positive and negative bonds in the Ising case and the\nqualitative form of the overlap distribution in all the models. The parallels\nwith infinite range spin glass models in both the analytical calculations and\nsimulations are pointed out.\n", "  In this paper we present the 1-loop perturbative computation of the\nrenormalization constants and mixing coefficients of the lattice quark\noperators of rank three whose hadronic elements enter in the determination of\nthe second moment of Deep Inelastic Scattering (DIS) structure functions.\n  We have employed in our calculations the nearest-neighbor improved\n``clover-leaf'' lattice QCD action. The interest of using this action in Monte\nCarlo simulations lies in the fact that all terms which in the continuum limit\nare effectively of order $a$ ($a$ being the lattice spacing) have been\ndemonstrated to be absent from on-shell hadronic lattice matrix elements. We\nhave limited our computations to the quenched case, in which quark operators do\nnot mix with gluon operators.\n  We have studied the transformation properties under the hypercubic group of\nthe operators up to the rank five (which are related to moments up to the\nfourth of DIS structure functions), and we discuss the choice of the operators\nconsidered in this paper together with the feasibility of lattice computations\nfor operators of higher ranks.\n  To perform the huge amount of calculations required for the evaluation of all\nthe relevant Feynman diagrams, we have extensively used the symbolic\nmanipulation languages Schoonschip and Form.\n", "  We digitally filter the Fourier modes of the link angles of an abelian\nlattice gauge field which produces the Fourier modes of a continuum $A_\\mu(x)$\nthat exactly reproduces the lattice links through their definition as phases of\nfinite parallel transport. The constructed interpolation is smooth\n($C^\\infty$), free from transition functions, and gauge equivariant. After\ndiscussing some properties of this interpolation, we discuss the non-abelian\ngeneralization of the method, arriving for SU(2), at a Cayley parametrization\nof the links in terms of the Fourier modes of $A^c_\\mu(x)$. We then discuss the\nuse of a maximum entropy type method to address gauge invariance in the\nnon-abelian case.\n", "  Finite temperature transition in lattice QCD with degenerate Wilson quarks is\ninvestigated on an $N_t=4$ lattice, using a renormalization group improved\ngauge action. We find the following for the $N_F=2$ case:\n  1) The transition is smooth for a wide range of the quark mass.\n  2) The chiral transition is continuous.\n  3) The chiral condensation well satisfies a scaling relation with the\ncritical exponents of the 3 dimensional $O(4)$ spin model. For $N_F=3$, we find\nthat the chiral transition is of first order.\n", "  We perform simulations of an absolute value version of the Villain model on\nphi3 and phi4 Feynman diagrams, ``thin'' 3-regular and 4-regular random graphs.\nThe phi4 results are in excellent quantitative agreement with the exact\ncalculations by Dorey and Kurzepa for an annealed ensemble of thin graphs, in\nspite of simulating only a single graph of each size. We also derive exact\nresults for an annealed ensemble of phi3 graphs and again find excellent\nagreement with the numerical data for single phi3 graphs.\n  The simulations confirm the picture of a mean field vortex transition which\nis suggested by the analytical results. Further simulations on phi5 and phi6\ngraphs and of the standard XY model on phi3 graphs confirm the universality of\nthese results. The calculations of Dorey and Kurzepa were based on\nreinterpreting the large orders behaviour of the anharmonic oscillator in a\nstatistical mechanical context so we also discuss briefly the interpretation of\nsingularities in the large orders behaviour in other models as phase\ntransitions.\n", "  The spatial distribution of fields and currents in confining theories can\ngive direct evidence of dual superconductivity. We review the behavior of\nvortices in the lattice Higgs effective theory. We discuss the techniques for\nfinding these properties and calculating the superconductivity parameters in\nlattice simulations. We have seen dual Abrikosov vortices directly in pure U(1)\nand SU(2) and others have also seen them in SU(3). We review the duality\ntransformation for U(1) in order to connect the U(1) results to a dual Higgs\ntheory.\n  In the non-Abelian cases the system appears to be near the borderline between\ntype I and II. We also discuss the response of the persistent currents to\nexternal fields.\n", "  We investigate the viability of the quasi-temporal gauge on the lattice. This\nis a complete gauge fixing condition that can be implemented on the lattice at\na very low computational cost. As a test case, using the Clover action, we have\nevaluated the (gauge invariant) renormalisation constant of the non-singlet\naxial current, using Ward identities extracted from quark states. Our result is\nin reasonable but not complete agreement with previous values obtained from\nWard identities both on hadronic states and on quark states in the Landau\ngauge. We observe large fluctuations due to lattice Gribov copies. The\ninfluence of finite volume effects is expected to be non-negligible in the case\nwe are considering.\n", "  We study the correlation functions in the branched polymer model. Although\nthere are no correlations in the grand canonical ensemble, when looking at the\ncanonical ensemble we find negative long range power like correlations. We\npropose that a similar mechanism explains the shape of recently measured\ncorrelation functions in the elongated phase of 4d simplicial gravity.\n", "  We use Monte Carlo simulations to study pure 2D Euclidean quantum gravity\nwith $R^2$-interaction on spherical topologies, employing Regge's formulation.\nWe attempt to measure the string susceptibility exponent $\\gamma_{\\rm str}$ by\nusing a finite-size scaling Ansatz in the expectation value of $R^2$, as has\nbeen done in a previous study by Bock and Vink ( hep-lat/9406018 ). By\nconsiderably extending the range and statistics of their study we find that\nthis Ansatz is plagued by large systematic errors. The $R^2$ specific string\nsusceptibility exponent $\\GS'$ is found to agree with theoretical predictions,\nbut its determination also is subject to large systematic errors and the\npresence of finite-size scaling corrections. To circumvent this obstacle we\nsuggest a new scaling Ansatz which in principle should be able to predict both,\n$\\GS$ and $\\GS'$. First results indicate that this requires large system sizes\nto reduce the uncertainties in the finite-size scaling Ans\\\"atze. Nevertheless,\nour investigation shows that within the achievable accuracy the numerical\nestimates are still compatible with analytic predictions, contrary to the\nrecent claim by Bock and Vink.\n", "  We examine the Kosterlitz-Thouless universality class and show that essential\nscaling at this type of phase transition is not self-consistent unless\nmultiplicative logarithmic corrections are included. In the case of specific\nheat these logarithmic corrections are identified analytically. To identify\nthose corresponding to the susceptibility we set up a numerical method\ninvolving the finite-size scaling of Lee-Yang zeroes. We also study the density\nof zeroes and introduce a new concept called index scaling. We apply the method\nto the XY-model and the closely related step model in two dimensions. The\ncritical parameters (including logarithmic corrections) of the step model are\ncompatable with those of the XY-model indicating that both models belong to the\nsame universality class. This result then raises questions over how a vortex\nbinding scenario can be the driving mechanism for the phase transition.\nFurthermore, the logarithmic corrections identified numerically by our methods\nof fitting are not in agreement with the renormalization group predictions of\nKosterlitz and Thouless.\n", "  We investigate a 3d Ising action which corresponds to a a class of models\ndefined by Savvidy and Wegner, originally intended as discrete versions of\nstring theories on cubic lattices. These models have vanishing bare surface\ntension and the couplings are tuned in such a way that the action depends only\non the angles of the discrete surface, i.e. on the way the surface is embedded\nin ${\\bf Z}^3$. Hence the name gonihedric by which they are known. We show that\nthe model displays a rather clear first order phase transition in the limit\nwhere self-avoidance is neglected and the action becomes a plaquette one. This\ntransition persists for small values of the self avoidance coupling, but it\nturns to second order when this latter parameter is further increased. These\nresults exclude the use of this type of action as models of gonihedric random\nsurfaces, at least in the limit where self avoidance is neglected.\n", "  Based on an analytical technique using a unitary transformation and the\nvariational method, we study the chiral order parameter in the Schwinger model\nin the lattice formalism with Kogut-Susskind fermions. The fermion condensate\n$\\langle {\\bar\\Psi} \\Psi \\rangle $ for any coupling constant and fermion mass\nare calculated. Chiral symmetry is shown to be broken in the massless limit and\ngood scaling behavior is obtained.\n", "  We present a theoretically consistent definition of the topological charge\noperator based on renormalization group arguments. Results of the\n  measurement of the topological susceptibility at zero and finite temperature\nfor SU(2) gauge theory are presented.\n", "  We review the application of random matrix theory (RMT) to chiral symmetry in\nQCD. Starting from the general philosophy of RMT we introduce a chiral random\nmatrix model with the global symmetries of QCD. Exact results are obtained for\nuniversal properties of the Dirac spectrum: i) finite volume corrections to\nvalence quark mass dependence of the chiral condensate, and ii) microscopic\nfluctuations of Dirac spectra. Comparisons with lattice QCD simulations are\nmade. Most notably, the variance of the number of levels in an interval\ncontaining $n$ levels on average is suppressed by a factor $(\\log n)/\\pi^2 n$.\nAn extension of the random matrix model model to nonzero temperatures and\nchemical potential provides us with a schematic model of the chiral phase\ntransition. In particular, this elucidates the nature of the quenched\napproximation at nonzero chemical potential.\n", "  We use a cooling algorithm based on an improved action with scale invariant\ninstanton solutions, which needs no monitoring or calibration and has a\ninherent cut off for dislocations. We present results for SU(2) Yang-Mills\ntheory where the method provides good susceptibility data and physical size\ndistributions of instantons.\n", "  We describe two ideas useful in the construction of highly improved quark\nactions for simulations on coarse lattices:\n  (1) Field transformations to solve the doubler problem without destroying\ntree-level improvement for on- or off-shell quantities.\n  (2) Anisotropic lattices with smaller temporal than spatial lattice spacing.\nWe present first simulation results for the quenched light hadron and\ncharmonium spectra obtained with a D234 action on anisotropic lattices.\n", "  Effective monopole actions for various extended monopoles are derived from\nvacuum configurations after abelian projection in the maximally abelian gauge\nin $T=0$ and $T\\ne 0$ $SU(3)$ lattice QCD. The actions obtained appear to be\nindependent of the lattice volume adopted. At zero temperature, monopole\ncondensation is seen to occur from energy-entropy balance in the strong\ncoupling region.\n  Larger $\\beta$ is included in the monopole condensed phase as more extended\nmonopoles are considered. The scaling seen in the $SU(2)$ case is not yet\nobserved. The renormalization flow diagram suggests the existence of an\ninfrared fixed point. A hysteresis behavior is seen around the critical\ntemperature in the case of the $T\\ne 0$ action.\n", "  The correlator of heavy-quark currents is calculated in quenched Lattice QCD\non a $16^3 \\times 32$-lattice for $\\beta= { 6, 6.3 }$. The renormalized charmed\nquark mass is extracted from the short-distance part of that correlator:\n$m_c^{\\overline{MS}}(m_c) = 1.22(5) GeV$. We study the sensitivity of our data\nto the strong coupling constant.\n", "  We present a study of ${\\cal O}(2000)$ (quenched) lattice configurations from\nthe APE collaboration, for $6.0\\le\\beta\\le 6.4$ using both the Wilson and the\nSW-Clover fermion action. We determine the light hadronic spectrum and meson\ndecay constants. We extract the inverse lattice spacing using data at the\nsimulated values of the quark mass. We find an agreement with the experimental\ndata of $\\sim 5%$ for mesonic masses and $\\sim 10%-15%$ for baryonic masses and\npseudoscalar decay constants. A larger deviation is present for the vector\ndecay constants.\n", "  The coefficients multiplying the counterterms required for O($a$) improvement\nof the action and the isovector axial current in lattice QCD are computed\nnon-perturbatively, in the quenched approximation and for bare gauge couplings\n$g_0$ in the range $0 \\leq g_0 \\leq 1$. A finite-size method based on the\nSchr\\\"odinger functional is employed, which enables us to perform all\ncalculations at zero or nearly zero quark mass. As a by-product the critical\nhopping parameter $\\kappa_c$ is obtained at all couplings considered.\n", "  We present estimates of light quarks masses using lattice data. Our main\nresults are based on a global analysis of all the published data for Wilson and\nStaggered fermions, both in the quenched approximation and with $n_f=2$\ndynamical flavors. The Wilson and Staggered results agree after extrapolation\nto the continuum limit for both the $n_f=0,2$ theories. Our best estimates, in\nthe MSbar scheme at scale $2 GeV$, are $mbar=3.2(4) MeV$ and $m_s = 90(20) MeV$\nin the quenched approximation, and $mbar ~ 2.7 MeV$ and $m_s ~ 70 MeV$ for the\n$n_f=2$ theory. These estimates are significantly smaller than phenomenological\nestimates based on sum rules, but maintain the ratios predicted by chiral\nperturbation theory. Along with the new estimates of 4-fermion operators, lower\nquark masses have a significant impact on the extraction of\n$\\epsilon'/\\epsilon$ from the Standard Model.\n", "  We present a high statistics, quenched lattice calculation of the\nB-parameters $B_{B_d}$ and $B_{B_s}$, computed at lowest order in the HQET. The\nresults were obtained using a sample of 600 quenched gauge field\nconfigurations, generated by Monte Carlo simulation at $\\beta=6.0$ on a\n$24^{3}\\times 40$ lattice. For the light quarks the SW-Clover action was used;\nthe propagator of the lattice HQET was also tree-level improved. Our best\nestimate of the renormalization scale independent B-parameter is $\\hat{B}_{B_d}\n= 1.03 \\pm 0.06 \\pm 0.18$. $\\hat{B}_{B_d}$ has been obtained by using\n``boosted'' perturbation theory to calculate the renormalization constants\nwhich relate the matrix elements of the lattice operators to the corresponding\namplitudes in the continuum. Due to the large statistics, the errors in the\nextraction of the matrix elements of the relevant bare operators are rather\nsmall. The main systematic error, corresponding to $\\pm 0.18$ in the above\nresult, comes from the uncertainty in the evaluation of the renormalization\nconstants, for which the one-loop corrections are rather large. The\nnon-perturbative evaluation of these constants will help to reduce the final\nerror. We also obtain $\\hat{B}_{B_s}/\\hat{B}_{B_d} = 1.01 \\pm 0.01$ and\n$f^2_{B_s}\\hat{B}_{B_s}/f^2_{B_d}\\hat{B}_{B_d} = 1.38 \\pm 0.07$.\n", "  We test iterative algorithms, MR, QMR$\\gamma_5$ and BiCG$\\gamma_5$, to\ncompare their efficiency in matrix inversion with multi-quarks (shifted\nmatrices) within one iteration process. Our results on the 8^3 x 12 and 16^3 x\n24 show that MR admits multi-quark calculation with less memory requirement,\nwhereas QMR is faster for the single quark calculation.\n", "  A finite-size technique is employed to compute the normalization constant\n$Z_A$ of the isovector axial current in lattice QCD. The calculation is carried\nout in the quenched approximation for values of the bare gauge coupling $g_0$\nranging from 0 to 1. In the lattice action and the lattice expression for the\naxial current we include the counterterms required for O(a) improvement, with\nnon-perturbatively determined coefficients. With little additional work the\nnormalization constant $Z_V$ of the improved isospin current is also obtained.\n", "  Numerical simulations of the quarkonium spin splittings are done in the\nframework of lattice nonrelativistic quantum chromodynamics (NRQCD). At leading\norder in the velocity expansion the spin splittings are of $O(M_Q v^4)$, where\n$M_Q$ is the renormalized quark mass and $v^2$ is the mean squared quark\nvelocity. A systematic analysis is done of all next-to-leading order\ncorrections. This includes the addition of $O(M_Q v^6)$ relativistic\ninteractions, and the removal of $O(a^2 M_Q v^4)$ discretization errors in the\nleading-order interactions. Simulations are done for both S- and P-wave mesons,\nwith a variety of heavy quark actions and over a wide range of lattice\nspacings. Two prescriptions for the tadpole improvement of the action are also\nstudied in detail: one using the measured value of the average plaquette, the\nother using the mean link measured in Landau gauge. Next-to-leading order\ninteractions result in a very large reduction in the charmonium splittings,\ndown by about 60% from their values at leading order. There are further\nindications that the velocity expansion may be poorly convergent for\ncharmonium. Prelimary results show a small correction to the hyperfine\nsplitting in the Upsilon system.\n", "  We report a fairly detailed finite-size scaling analysis of the first-order\nphase transition in the three-dimensional 3-state Potts model on cubic lattices\nwith emphasis on recently introduced quantities whose infinite-volume\nextrapolations are governed `only' by exponentially small terms. In these\nquantities no asymptotic power series in the inverse volume are involved which\ncomplicate the finite-size scaling behaviour of standard observables related to\nthe specific-heat maxima or Binder-parameter minima. Introduced initially for\nstrong first-order phase transitions in q-state Potts models with ``large\nenough'' q, the new techniques prove to be surprisingly accurate for a q value\nas small as 3. On the basis of the high-precision Monte Carlo data of Alves `et\nal.' [Phys. Rev. B43 (1991) 5846], this leads to a refined estimate of $\\beta_t\n= 0.550,565(10)$ for the infinite-volume transition point.\n", "  We analyze the perturbative expansion of a condensate in the O(N) non-linear\nsigma model for large N on a two dimensional finite lattice. On an infinite\nvolume this expansion is affected by an infrared renormalon. We extrapolate\nthis analysis to the case of the gluon condensate of Yang-Mills theory and\nargue that infrared renormalons can be detected by performing perturbative\nstudies even on relatively small lattices.\n", "  By using the results of a high-statistics (O(10^7) measurements) Monte Carlo\nsimulation we test several predictions of perturbation theory on the O(n)\nnon-linear sigma-model in 2 dimensions. We study the O(3) and O(8) models on\nlarge enough lattices to have a good control on finite-size effects. The\nmagnetic susceptibility and three different definitions of the correlation\nlength are measured. We check our results with large-n expansions as well as\nwith standard formulae for asymptotic freedom up to 4 loops in the standard and\neffective schemes.\n  For this purpose the weak coupling expansions of the energy up to 4 loops for\nthe standard action and up to 3 loops for the Symanzik action are calculated.\nFor the O(3) model we have used two different effective schemes and checked\nthat they lead to compatible results. A great improvement in the results is\nobtained by using the effective scheme based on the energy at 3 and 4 loops. We\nfind that the O(8) model follows very nicely (within few per mille) the\nperturbative predictions. For the O(3) model an acceptable agreement (within\nfew per cent) is found.\n", "  We present a high statistics study of the D- and B-meson decay constants. The\nresults were obtained by using the Clover and Wilson lattice actions at two\ndifferent values of the lattice spacing $a$, corresponding to $\\beta=6.0$ and\n6.2. After a careful analysis of the systematic errors present in the\nextraction of the physical results, by assuming quite conservative\ndiscretization errors, we find $f_{D_s}=237 \\pm 16$ MeV, $f_{D} = 221 \\pm 17$\nMeV ($f_{D_s}/f_D=1.07(4)$), $f_{B_s} = 205 \\pm 35$ MeV, $f_{B} = 180 \\pm 32$\nMeV ($f_{B_s}/f_B=1.14(8)$), in good agreement with previous estimates.\n", "  For the 3D gonihedric Ising models defined by Savvidy and Wegner the bare\nstring tension is zero and the energy of a spin interface depends only on the\nnumber of bends and self-intersections, in antithesis to the standard\nnearest-neighbour 3D Ising action. When the parameter kappa weighting the\nself-intersections is small the model has a first order transition and when it\nis larger the transition is continuous.\n  In this paper we investigate the scaling of the renormalized string tension,\nwhich is entirely generated by fluctuations, using Monte Carlo simulations This\nallows us to obtain an estimate for the critical exponents alpha and nu using\nboth finite-size-scaling and data collapse for the scaling function.\n", "  A mean field analysis of finite density QCD is presented including the\neffects of additional chiral invariant four-fermion interactions. A lattice\nregularization is used with N_f=4 flavors of staggered fermions. The use of the\nfour-fermion coupling as an improved extrapolation parameter over the bare\nquark mass in Monte Carlo simulations is discussed. Particular attention is\ngiven to the structure of the phase diagram and the order of the chiral phase\ntransition. At zero gauge coupling, the model reduces to a Nambu-Jona-Lasinio\nmodel. In this limit the chiral phase transition is found to be second-order\nnear the zero-density critical point and otherwise first-order. In the strong\ngauge coupling limit a first-order chiral phase transition is found. In this\nlimit the additional four-fermion interactions do not qualitatively change the\nphysics. The results agree with previous studies of QCD as the four-fermion\ncoupling vanishes.\n", "  We analyze the phase diagram of compact QED on the torus with a chirally\nsymmetric four fermion interaction added to the usual Wilson action. Inside a\nmean field approximation for the four fermion term, a line of first order phase\ntransitions and another one of second order are found in the $(\\beta, G)$\nplane. Approaching the second order line a continuum limit can be defined.\nCritical exponents vary along this line in a similar way as in the non-compact\nmodel, suggesting that a non trivial interacting continuum theory can be\nconstructed.\n", "  Recent results for B meson decay constants with NRQCD b-quarks and clover\nlight quarks are discussed. Perturbative matching factors through O($\\alpha/M$)\nare now available and incorporated into the analyses. An O($\\alpha a$)\nimprovement term to the heavy-light axial current is identified and included.\nThe slope of $f_{PS}\\sqrt{M_{PS}}$ versus $1/M_{PS}$ is significantly reduced\nby these corrections.\n", "  We discuss dynamical breaking of non-abelian gauge groups in three\ndimensional (lattice) gauge systems via the formation of fermion condensates. A\nphysically relevant example, motivated by condensed-matter physics, is that of\na fermionic gauge theory with group $SU(2)\\otimes U_S(1) \\otimes U_{E}(1)$. In\nthe strong U_S(1) region, the SU(2) symmetry breaks down to a U(1), due to the\nformation of a parity-invariant fermion condensate. We conjecture a phase\ndiagram for the theory involving a critical line, which separates the regions\nof broken SU(2) symmetry from those where the symmetry is restored. In the\nbroken phase, the effective Abelian gauge theory is closely related to an\nearlier model of two-dimensional parity-invariant superconductivity in doped\nantiferromagnets. The superconductivity in the model occurs in the\nKosterlitz-Thouless mode, since strong phase fluctuations prevent the existence\nof a local order parameter. Some physical consequences of the $SU(2) \\times\nU_S(1)$ phase diagram for the (doping-dependent) parameter space of this\ncondensed-matter model are briefly discussed.\n", "  We study the phenomenon of lack of reversibility in molecular dynamics\nalgorithms for the case of Wilson's lattice QCD. We demonstrate that the\nclassical equations of motion that are employed in these algorithms are chaotic\nin nature. The leading Liapunov exponent is determined in a range of coupling\nparameters. We give a quantitative estimate of the consequences of the\nbreakdown of reversibility due to round-off errors.\n", "  We present a high statistics study of the D- and B-meson decay constants. The\nresults were obtained by using the Clover and Wilson lattice actions at\n$\\beta=6.0$ and 6.2.\n", "  We report on a numerical investigation of the SU(2) gauge theory with\ngluinos.\n  The low-lying spectrum in bosonic and fermionic channels is determined.\n  Improvements of the multi-bosonic algorithm are discussed.\n", "  We discuss the possibility of extracting phase shifts from finite volume\nenergies for meson-meson scattering, where the mesons are fermion-antifermion\nbound states of the massive Schwinger model with SU(2) flavour symmetry. The\nexistence of analytical strong coupling predictions for the mass spectrum and\nfor the scattering phases makes it possible to test the reliability of\nnumerical results.\n", "  We study topological properties of SU(3) gauge theory using improved cooling.\nIn the absence of fermions, we measure a topological susceptibility of $(182(8)\nMeV)^4$ and an instanton size $\\sim 0.6$ fm. In the presence of light staggered\nfermions and across the chiral transition, the susceptibility drops in a manner\nconsistent with the quenched case, and the instanton size changes little. No\nsignificant formation of bound instanton-antiinstanton pairs is observed, in\nparticular not along the Euclidean time direction for $T > T_c$.\n", "  We review recent developments in real-time simulations of SU(2)-Higgs theory\nnear the electroweak transition and related topics.\n", "  We compute several matrix elements of dimension-six four-fermion operators\nand extract their B-parameters. The calculations have been performed with the\ntree-level Clover action at $\\beta = 6.0$. The renormalization constants and\nmixing coefficients of the lattice operators have been obtained\nnon-perturbatively. In the $\\MSbar$ renormalization scheme, at a\nrenormalization scale $\\mu \\simeq 2$ GeV, we find $B_K (B_9^{3/2}) = 0.66(11),\nB_7^{3/2} = 0.72(5)$ and $B_8^{3/2} = 1.03(3)$. The result for $B_8^{3/2}$ has\nimportant implications for the calculation of $\\epsilon^\\prime / \\epsilon$.\n", "  We study the spectral flow of the hermitian Wilson-Dirac operator $\\ham(m)$\nas a function of $m$ in smooth SU(2) instanton backgrounds on the lattice. For\na single instanton background with Dirichlet boundary conditions on $\\ham(m)$,\nwe find a level crossing in the spectral flow of $\\ham(m)$, and we find the\nshape of the crossing mode at the crossing point to be in good agreement with\nthe zero mode associated with the single instanton background. With\nanti-periodic boundary conditions on $\\ham(m)$, we find that the instanton\nbackground in the singular gauge has the correct spectral flow but the one in\nregular gauge does not. We also investigate the spectral flows of two instanton\nand instanton-anti-instanton backgrounds.\n", "  This talk is a review of our studies of instantons and their properties as\nseen in our lattice simulations of SU(2) gauge theory. We have measured the\ntopological susceptibility and the size distribution of instantons in the QCD\nvacuum.\n  We have also investigated the properties of quarks moving in instanton\nbackground field configurations, where the sizes and locations of the\ninstantons are taken from simulations of the full gauge theory. By themselves,\nthese multi-instanton configurations do not confine quarks, but they induce\nchiral symmetry breaking.\n", "  We make a comparison of two tadpole renormalization schemes in the context of\nthe quarkonium hyperfine splittings in lattice NRQCD. Improved gauge-field and\nNRQCD actions are analyzed using the mean-link $u_{0,L}$ in Landau gauge, and\nusing the fourth root of the average plaquette $u_{0,P}$. Simulations are done\nfor $c\\bar c$, $b\\bar c$, and $b\\bar b$ systems. The hyperfine splittings are\ncomputed both at leading and at next-to-leading order in the relativistic\nexpansion. Results are obtained at lattice spacings in the range of about\n0.14~fm to 0.38~fm. A number of features emerge, all of which favor tadpole\nrenormalization using $u_{0,L}$. This includes much better scaling behavior of\nthe hyperfine splittings in the three quarkonium systems when $u_{0,L}$ is\nused. We also find that relativistic corrections to the spin splittings are\nsmaller when $u_{0,L}$ is used, particularly for the $c\\bar c$ and $b\\bar c$\nsystems. We also see signs of a breakdown in the NRQCD expansion when the bare\nquark mass falls below about one in lattice units. Simulations with $u_{0,L}$\nalso appear to be better behaved in this context: the bare quark masses turn\nout to be larger when $u_{0,L}$ is used, compared to when $u_{0,P}$ is used on\nlattices with comparable spacings. These results also demonstrate the need to\ngo beyond tree-level tadpole improvement for precision simulations.\n", "  The Wilson-Dirac matrix for SU(2) with I=1/2 fermions is written in an\nexplicitly real form. The basis change relating it to the conventional form in\nwhich the matrix has complex entries is also given. Some applications are\npresented.\n", "  For the classical N-vector model, with arbitrary N, we have computed through\norder \\beta^{17} the high temperature expansions of the second field derivative\nof the susceptibility \\chi_4(N,\\beta) on the simple cubic and on the body\ncentered cubic lattices. (The N-vector model is also known as the O(N)\nsymmetric classical spin Heisenberg model or, in quantum field theory, as the\nlattice\n  O(N) nonlinear sigma model.) By analyzing the expansion of \\chi_4(N,\\beta) on\nthe two lattices, and by carefully allowing for the corrections to scaling, we\nobtain updated estimates of the critical parameters and more accurate tests of\nthe hyperscaling relation d\\nu(N) +\\gamma(N) -2\\Delta_4(N)=0 for a range of\nvalues of the spin dimensionality N, including\n  N=0 [the self-avoiding walk model], N=1 [the Ising spin 1/2 model],\n  N=2 [the XY model], N=3 [the classical Heisenberg model]. Using the recently\nextended series for the susceptibility and for the second correlation moment,\nwe also compute the dimensionless renormalized four point coupling constants\nand some universal ratios of scaling correction amplitudes in fair agreement\nwith recent renormalization group estimates.\n", "  Witten's anomaly for SU(2) with a single I=1/2 Weyl fermion in four dimension\nis shown to be reproduced by the lattice overlap. The mechanism is based on\nBerry's phase, and on the analyticity of the matrix $H$ by which the overlap is\ndefined.\n", "  We analyze hadron as well as quark and diquark correlation functions in\nLandau gauge in order to extract information on the spin dependence of the\nquark-quark interaction. We find evidence that the N-Delta mass splitting can\nbe attributed to the spin dependence of the interaction between quarks in a\ncolour anti-triplet state with spin 0 and 1, respectively. The lightest\nexcitations are observed in the S=0 channel. However, no evidence for a deeply\nbound diquark state is found.\n", "  We present a calculation of the renormalisation constants for the temporal\nvector current, $Z_{V_0}$ and spatial axial current, $Z_{A_k}$, to\n$O(\\alpha_s/M)$ for $B\\to D$ transitions using the $O(1/M)$ NRQCD action for\nboth $b$ and $c$ quarks evaluated for a large range of mass parameters.\nConsiderations for the renormalisation of the spatial vector current and the\ntemporal axial current are discussed and initial results for a mixed lattice\ncurrent are presented for the spatial vector current.\n", "  We discuss the thermodynamics of two-colour QCD with four flavours of\nstaggered quarks on 8^3x4 and 16^3x4 lattices. In our simulations we use the\nNaik action for the fermions and a (1,2) tree-level improved gauge action. We\nanalyze the deconfinement and chiral phase transitions for four different quark\nmasses (m=0.1,0.05,0.025,0.015). Contrary to three-colour QCD the peak in the\nPolyakov loop susceptibility decreases with decreasing quark mass. This\nreflects an early breaking of the string in the heavy quark potential, which we\nverify explicitly by calculating the heavy quark potential at finite\ntemperature using Polyakov loop correlations.\n", "  Energies of four-quark systems with the tetrahedral geometry measured by the\nstatic quenched SU(2) lattice Monte Carlo method are analyzed by parametrizing\nthe gluon overlap factor in the form exp(-[bs EA+{\\sqrt bs}FP]) where A and P\nare the area and the perimeter defined mainly by the positions of the four\nquarks, bs is the string constant in the 2-quark potentials and E, F are\nconstants.\n", "  CP(N-1) model with topological term is numerically studied. The topological\ncharge distribution P(Q) is calculated and then transformed to the partition\nfunction Z($\\theta$) as a function of $\\theta$ parameter. In the strong\ncoupling region, P(Q) shows a gaussian behavior, which indicates a first order\nphase transition at $\\theta =\\pi$. In the weak coupling region,\n  P(Q) deviates from gaussian. A bending behavior of resulting F($\\theta$) at\n$\\theta \\neq \\pi$, which might be a signal of a first order phase transition,\ncould be misled by large errors coming from the fourier transform of P(Q).\nResults are shown mainly for CP(3) case.\n", "  We resolve contradictions in the literature concerning the origins and size\nof unphysical flavor-changing strong interactions generated by the\nstaggered-quark discretization of QCD. We show that the leading contributions\nare tree-level in $\\order(a^2)$ and that they can be removed by adding three\ncorrection terms to the link operator in the standard action. These corrections\nare part of the systematic Symanzik improvement of the staggered-quark action.\nWe present a new improved action for staggered quarks that is accurate up to\nerrors of $\\order(a^4,a^2\\alpha_s)$ --- more accurate than most, if not all,\nother discretizations of light-quark dynamics.\n", "  The hopping expansion of 8-vertex models in their Grassmann representation is\nstudied. We use the functional similarity of the Ising model in this expansion\nwith the hopping expansion of 2-D Wilson fermions to show that the lattice\nfermions are equivalent to the Self-avoiding Loop Model at bending rigidity\n1/sqrt{2}.\n", "  The Ginsparg-Wilson(G-W) relation is extended for supersymmetric free\ntheories on a lattice.\n  Exact lattice supersymmetry(SUSY) can be defined without any ambiguities in\ndifference operators. The lattice action constructed by a block-spin\ntransformation is invariant under the symmetry. $U(1)_R$ symmetry on the\nlattice is also realized as one of exact symmetries.\n  For an application, the extended G-W relation is given for a two-dimensional\nmodel with chiral-multiplets. It is argued that the relation may be generalized\nfor interacting cases.\n", "  Evidence from lattice QCD calculations is presented showing that instantons\nand their associated zero modes play a major role in the physics of light\nhadrons and the propagation of light quarks in the QCD vacuum.\n", "  We study the dual Higgs mechanism induced by monopole condensation based on\nthe dual gauge formalism in the maximally abelian (MA) gauge in the lattice\nQCD. To examine ``monopole condensation'' in QCD, we study the monopole part or\nthe monopole-current system appearing in the MA gauge by extracting the dual\ngluon field $B_\\mu$. First, we investigate the inter-monopole potential using\nthe dual Wilson loop in the lattice QCD simulation. In the monopole part in the\nMA gauge, the inter-monopole potential is found to be flat, and can be fitted\nas the Yukawa potential in the infrared region. From more detailed analysis of\nthe inter-monopole potential considering the monopole size, we estimate the\neffective dual-gluon mass $m_B \\simeq 0.5$GeV and the effective monopole size\n$R_{^{_{\\rm M}}} \\simeq 0.2$fm. Second, we study the dual gluon propagator\n$G^D_{\\mu\\nu}(x-y) \\equiv < B_\\mu(x) B_\\nu(y) >_{\\rm MA}$ in the MA gauge, and\nfind that $G^D_{\\mu\\mu}$ behaves as the massive vector-boson propagator with\n$m_B \\simeq 0.4$ GeV in the infrared region. The effective-mass acquirement of\nthe dual gluon field $B_\\mu$ at the long distance can be regarded as the\nlattice QCD evidence of ``infrared monopole condensation'' in the MA gauge.\n", "  One loop correction to the SUSY Ward-Takahashi identity is calculated on\nlattice with Wilson fermion. The supersymmetry on lattice is broken explicitly\nby the gluino mass and the lattice artifact. We should fine tune parameters in\nthe theory to the point given by the additive mass correction in order to\neliminate the breaking effect of lattice artifact. It is shown that the\nadditive mass correction appearing from the SUSY Ward-Takahashi identity\ncoincide with that from the axial $U(1)_R$ symmetry as was suggested by Curci\nand Veneziano. Two important symmetries of the super Yang-Mills theory can be\nrecovered simultaneously in the continuum with a single fine tuning.\n  Operator mixing of the supercurrent are also investigated. We find that the\nsupercurrent mixes only with a gauge invariant current $T_\\mu$ which is related\nto the gamma-trace anomaly.\n", "  We find that Polyakov lines, computed in abelian-projected SU(2) lattice\ngauge theory in the confined phase, have finite expectation values for lines\ncorresponding to two units of the abelian electric charge. This means that the\nabelian-projected lattice has at most Z(2), rather than U(1), global symmetry.\nWe also find a severe breakdown of the monopole dominance approximation, as\nwell as positivity, in this charge-2 case. These results imply that the\nabelian-projected lattice is not adequately represented by a monopole Coulomb\ngas; the data is, however, consistent with a center vortex structure. Further\nevidence is provided, in lattice Monte Carlo simulations, for collimation of\nconfining color-magnetic flux into vortices.\n", "  The dynamical triangulations approach to quantum gravity is investigated in\ndetail for the first time in five dimensions. In this case, the most general\naction that is linear in components of the f-vector has three terms. It was\nsuspected that the corresponding space of couplings would yield a rich phase\nstructure. This work is primarily motivated by the hope that this new viewpoint\nwill lead to a deeper understanding of dynamical triangulations in general.\nUltimately, this research programme may give a better insight into the\npotential application of dynamical triangulations to quantum gravity. This\nthesis serves as an exploratory study of this uncharted territory.\n  The five dimensional (k,l) moves used in the Monte Carlo algorithm are proven\nto be ergodic in the space of combinatorially equivalent simplicial\n5-manifolds. A statement is reached regarding the possible existence of an\nexponential upper bound on the number of combinatorially equivalent\ntriangulations of the 5-sphere. Monte Carlo simulations reveal non-trivial\nphase structure which is analysed in some detail. Further investigations deal\nwith the geometric and fractal nature of triangulations. This is followed by a\ncharacterisation of the weak coupling limit in terms of stacked spheres. Simple\ngraph theory arguments are used to reproduce and generalise a well-known result\nin combinatorial topology. Finally, a comprehensive study of singular\nstructures in dynamical triangulations is presented. It includes a new\nunderstanding of their existence, which appears to be consistent with the\nnon-existence of singular vertices in three dimensions. The thesis is concluded\nwith an overview of results, general discussion and suggestions for future\nwork.\n", "  We review the recent progress on our understanding of self-dual SU(N)\nYang-Mills configurations on the torus.\n", "  In the possible scaling region for an SU(2) lattice chiral fermion advocated\nin {\\it Nucl. Phys.} B486 (1997) 282, no hard spontaneous symmetry breaking\noccurs and doublers are gauge-invariantly decoupled via mixing with composite\nthree-fermion-states that are formed by local multifermion interactions.\nHowever the strong coupling expansion breaks down due to no ``static limit''\nfor the low-energy limit ($pa\\sim 0$). In both neutral and charged channels, we\nfurther analyze relevant truncated Green functions of three-fermion-operators\nby the strong coupling expansion and analytical continuation of these Green\nfunctions in the momentum space. It is shown that in the low-energy limit,\nthese relevant truncated Green functions of three-fermion-states with the\n``wrong'' chiralities positively vanish due to the generalized form factors\n(the wave-function renormalizations) of these composite three-fermion-states\nvanishing as O((pa)^4) for $pa\\sim 0$. This strongly implies that the composite\nthree-fermion-states with ``wrong'' chirality are ``decoupled'' in this limit\nand the low-energy spectrum is chiral, as a consequence, chiral gauge\nsymmetries can be exactly preserved.\n", "  The chiral anomaly in lattice abelian gauge theory is investigated by\napplying the geometric and topological method in noncommutative differential\ngeometry(NCDG). A new kind of double complex and descent equation are proposed\non infinite hypercubic lattice in arbitrary even dimensional Euclidean space,\nin the framework of NCDG. Using the general solutions to proposed descent\nequation, we derive the chiral anomaly in Abelian lattice gauge theory. The\ntopological origin of anomaly is nothing but the Chern classes in NCDG.\n", "  A new class of vortex solutions is found in SU(2) gauge theories with two\nadjoint representation Higgs bosons. Implications of these new solutions and\ntheir possible connection with Center Gauge fixed pure gauge theories are\ndiscussed.\n", "  We consider a theory of gauge fields and fermions which we argue gives rise\nto dynamics similar to that of the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model when a gauge\ncoupling constant is appropriately fine-tuned. We discuss the application of\nthis model to dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking by a top-quark\ncondensate. In this model, custodial symmetry is violated solely by\nperturbatively weak interactions, and the top--bottom mass splitting is due to\nthe enhanced sensitivity to custodial symmetry violation near the critical\npoint. We also consider models in which electroweak symmetry is broken by new\nstrongly- interacting fermions with NJL-like dynamics. We argue that these\nmodels require additional fine-tuning in order to keep corrections to the\nelectroweak $\\rho$-parameter acceptably small.\n", "  We compute the threshold uncertainties due to unknown masses of the Higgs\nbosons on the predictions for the intermediate and unification scales, $M_I$\nand $M_U$ respectively in SO(10) models.We focus on models with separate\nbreaking scales for Parity and $SU(2)_R$ symmetries since they provide a\nnatural realization of the see-saw mechanism for neutrino masses. For the two\nstep symmetry breaking chains ,where left-right symmetric gauge groups appear\nat the intermediate scale, we find that parity invariance of the theory at the\nunification scale drastically reduces the GUT threshold effects in some cases.\nIncluding the effects of the intermediate scale thresholds ,we compute the\nuncertainty in the above mass scales and study their implications for proton\nlifetime and neutrino masses. An important outcome of our analysis is that if\nthe currently favored nonadiabatic MSW solution to the solar neutrino puzzle is\naccepted , it will rule out the $SU(2)_LXSU(2)_RXU(1)_{B-L}X SU(3)_c$ as an\nintermediate symmetry for SO(10) breaking whereas the intermediate symmetry\n$SU(2)_LXSU(2)_RXSU(4)_c$, is quite consistent with it.\n", "  Semileptonic decay of the $B_c$ meson is studied in the heavy quark limit.\nThe six possible form factors for $B_c \\rightarrow B_s (B^0),B_s^* (B^{*0})$\nsemileptonic decay are determined by two invariant functions. Only one of these\nfunctions contributes at zero recoil, where it is calculable to lowest order in\nan operator product expansion in terms of the meson decay constant $f_B$ and\nthe $B_c$ wavefunction. A similar result is found for $B_c \\rightarrow\nD^0,D^{*0}$ and for $B_c\\rightarrow\\eta_c,J/\\psi$ semileptonic decay for a\nrestricted kinematic region. Semileptonic $B_c$ decay provides a means for\ndetermining the KM mixing angle $|V_{ub}|$.\n", "  I remark that the weak mixing angle in the standard model may be computed\neven in the absence of a grand unification symmetry. In particular, if there is\nan additional gauged $U(1)$ symmetry at some large scale which can be made\nanomaly-free only by a Green-Schwarz (GS) mechanism, this typically results in\na prediction for the weak angle. In the case of the standard model one can see\nthat the standard Peccei-Quinn symmetry may be gauged and the anomalies\ncancelled through a GS mechanism. Remarkably enough, cancelation of anomalies\nworks only for the `canonical' value $sin^2\\theta _W=3/8$. In the case of the\nsupersymmetric standard model one can also find $U(1)$ currents which may be\nmade anomaly-free through a GS but the canonical value is only obtained in the\nabsence of any Higgs multiplet. If the analysis is extended to include $U(1)$\nR-symmetries, there is a unique class of $U(1)$s which give rise to the\ncanonical value. The R-symmetry is only anomaly-free for $sin^2\\theta\n_W=(4N_g-3)/(10N_g-3N_D-3)$, where $N_g,N_D$ are the number of generations and\nHiggs pairs. The natural context in which the above scenario may naturally\narise is string theory. I also emphasize other interesting possibilities\noffered by the GS mechanism to model-building.\n", "  There exists a class of cosmic strings that turn matter into antimatter\n(Alice strings). In a GUT where the unbroken gauge group contains charge\nconjugation ($C$), such strings form when a phase transition renders $C$ a\ndiscrete symmetry. They become boundaries of domain walls at a later,\n$C$-breaking transition. These `Alice walls' are cosmologically harmless, but\ncan play an important role in baryogenesis. We present a three-generation toy\nmodel with scalar baryons, where a quasi-static Alice wall (or a gas of such\nwalls) temporarily gives rise to net baryogenesis of uniform sign everywhere in\nspace. This becomes a permanent baryon excess if the wall shrinks away early\nenough.\n  We comment on the possible relevance of a similar mechanism to baryogenesis\nin a realistic $\\soten$ unification model, where\n  Alice walls would form at the scale of left-right symmetry breaking.\n", "  We present an in depth discussion of the production of gravitational waves\nfrom an inflationary phase that could have occurred in the early universe,\ngiving derivations for the resulting spectrum and energy density. We also\nconsider the large-scale anisotropy in the cosmic microwave background\nradiation coming from these waves. Assuming that the observed quadrupole\nanisotropy comes mostly from gravitational waves (consistent with the\npredictions of a flat spectrum of scalar density perturbations and the measured\ndipole anisotropy) we describe in detail how to derive a value for the scale of\ninflation of $(1.5-5)\\times 10^{16}$GeV, which is at a particularly interesting\nscale for particle physics. This upper limit corresponds to a 95\\% confidence\nlevel upper limit on the scale of inflation assuming only that the quadrupole\nanisotropy from gravitational waves is not cancelled by another source. Direct\ndetection of gravitational waves produced by inflation near this scale will\nhave to wait for the next generation of detectors.\n", "  Dynamical symmetry breaking in three-dimensional QED with N fermion flavours\nis considered at finite temperature, in the large $N$ approximation. Using an\napproximate treatment of the Schwinger-Dyson equation for the fermion\nself-energy, we find that chiral symmetry is restored above a certain critical\ntemperature which depends itself on $N$. We find that the ratio of the\nzero-momentum zero-temperature fermion mass to the critical temperature has a\nlarge value compared with four-fermion theories, as had been suggested in a\nprevious work with a momentum-independent self-energy. Evidence of a\ntemperature- dependent critical $N$ is shown to appear in this approximation.\nThe phase diagram for spontaneous mass generation in the theory is presented in\n$T-N$ space.\n", "  We examine the spin-dependence of standard model Higgs boson production at\nlarge transverse momentum via the processes $gg \\rightarrow gH^0$, $qg\n\\rightarrow qH^0$, and $q\\overline{q} \\rightarrow gH^0$. The partonic level\nspin-spin asymmetries ($\\hat{a}_{LL}$) for these processes are large at SSC/LHC\nenergies.\n", "  We study the 3d effective theory of the high T Abelian Higgs model with N\nreal scalars and gauge and scalar couplings denoted g and $\\lambda$,\nrespectively. We find for the three cases a) $6g^2/\\lambda =0(1)$, b)\n$6g^2/\\lambda=0(N)$ and c) $6g^2/\\lambda=O(N^{2\\over3})$ the following results:\na) The O(N)+O(1) potential admits only a second order phase transition, b) The\nO(1) potential admits a first order transition and c) the O(N^{1\\over3}) +O(1)\nresult gives a first order transition whose strength diminshes with N.\n", "  We simulate the production of vortices in a first order phase transition at\nfinite temperature. The transition is carried out by randomly nucleating\ncritical bubbles and the effects of thermal fluctuations (which could be\nrelevant for vortex production) are represented by randomly nucleating\nsubcritical bubbles. Our results show that the presence of subcritical bubbles\nsuppresses vortices with clear and prominent profiles, though net number of\nvortices is consistent with theoretical estimates. We also determine the\ntypical speed of vortices arising due to randomness associated with the phase\ntransition to be about 0.5.\n", "  We compute the next to leading QCD corrections to weak four fermion\ninteractions introducing a scheme that does not require an explicit definition\nof $\\gamma_5$ in $d$ dimensions. This scheme reduces greatly the difficulties\nin calculating the two loop anomalous dimensions; we recover the results\nobtained in the previous literature.\n", "  We study the low energy effective field theory of fermions with electric and\nmagnetic dipole moments at finite temperature. We find that at one loop there\nis an interaction term of the Chern-Simon form ${\\cal L_I}=m_\\mu\\>A_\\nu {\\tilde\nF}^{\\mu\\nu}$. The four vector $m_\\mu \\simeq d_i \\mu_i m_i^2\n~{\\partial_\\mu}\\>(ln T)$ is interpreted as a Chern- Simon type mass of photons,\nwhich is determined by the electric (magnetic) dipole moments $d_i$ ($\\mu_i$)\nof the fermions in the vacuum polarisation loop diagram. The physical\nconsequence of such a photon mass is that, photons of opposite circular\npolarisations, propagating through a hot medium, have different group\nvelocities. We estimate that the time lag between the arrival times of the left\nand right circularly polarised light signals from pulsars. If the light\npropagates through a hot plasma (where the temperature in some regions is $T\n\\sim 100 MeV$) then the time lag between the two circularly polarised signals\nof frequency $\\omega$ will be $\\Delta t(\\omega) \\simeq 10^{-6} /\\omega$. It may\nbe possible to observe this effect in pulsar signals which propagate through\nnebula at high temperatures.\n", "  A detailed analysis on the rare $\\tau$ decay {\\it via} $\\taumue$ and\n$\\taumus$ in the string models with $\\e6$ symmetry is reported. It is found\nthat $\\Gamma(\\taumue)\\sim(6-7)\\Gamma(\\taumus)$ and these rates are in general\nabout 1000 times less than that of $\\Gamma(\\mu\\rightarrow e\\gamma)$. It is also\nfound that the out-going muon in $\\taumue$ is almost 100\\% right-handed\npolarized and the out-going electrons would be predominately parallel to each\nother. These decay processes may be accessible at the SSC.\n", "  We study the incorporation of QCD effects in the basic electroweak\ncorrections \\drcar, \\drcarw, and \\dr. They include perturbative\n\\Ord{\\alpha\\alpha_s} contributions and $t\\bar{t}$ threshold effects. The latter\nare studied in the resonance and Green-function approaches, in the framework of\ndispersion relations that automatically satisfy relevant Ward identities.\nRefinements in the treatment of the electroweak corrections, in both the \\ms\\\nand the on-shell schemes of renormalization, are introduced, including the\ndecoupling of the top quark in certain amplitudes, its effect on\n$\\hat{e}^2(\\mz)$ and \\sincarmz, the incorporation of recent results on the\nleading irreducible \\Ord{\\alpha^2} corrections, and simple expressions for the\nresidual, i.e.\\ ``non-electromagnetic'', parts of \\drcar, \\drcarw, and \\dr. The\nresults are used to obtain accurate values for \\mw\\ and \\sincarmz, as functions\nof \\mt\\ and \\mh. The higher-order effects induce shifts in these parameters\ncomparable to the expected experimental accuracy, and they increase the\nprediction for \\mt\\ derived from current measurements. The \\ms\\ and the\non-shell calculations of \\dr, in a recently proposed formulation, are compared\nand found to be in excellent agreement over the wide ranges $60\\GeV \\leq \\mh\n\\leq 1 \\TeV$, $\\mz \\leq \\mt \\leq 250 \\GeV$.\n", "  Based on the equal-time Wigner function for the Klein-Gordon field, we\ndiscuss analytically the mechanism of pair creation in a classical\nelectromagnetic field including back-reaction. It is shown that the equations\nof motion for the Wigner function can be reduced to a variable-frequency\noscillator. The pair-creation rate results then from a calculation analogous to\nbarrier penetration in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics. The Wigner function\nallows one to utilize this treatment for the formulation of an effective\ntransport theory for the back-reaction problem with a pair-creation source term\nincluding Bose enhancement.\n", "  We give an upper estimate for the number of gamma ray bursts from ordinary\n(non-superconducting) cosmic strings expected to be observed at terrestrial\ndetectors. Assuming that cusp annihilation is the mechanism responsible for the\nbursts we consider strings arising at a GUT phase transition and compare our\nestimate with the recent BATSE results. Further we give a lower limit for the\neffective area of future detectors designed to detect the cosmic string induced\nflux of gamma ray bursts.\n", "  In gauge theories with slowly-running coupling constants, it may be possible\nfor four-fermion operators to be nearly marginal. Such operators can possess\nasymptotically weak couplings, and can plausibly give rise to light composite\nvector mesons.\n", "  We have calculated part of O(${\\alpha}_{S}$) QCD radiative correction to the\ntotal cross-section of top's threshold production in $ e^{+}e^{-} \\to t\\bar t\n\\to W^{-} b W^{+} \\bar b$ reaction. We found out a curious fact: there is no\nO(${\\alpha}_{S}$) correction to the total cross-section, originated from $b\n\\bar b , t \\bar b ,\\bar t b $ gluon exchange and corresponding gluon emission.\nThus, all O(${\\alpha}_{S}$) corrections which are non-zero, can be classified\nas: 1) corrections to $t \\bar t$ nonrelativistic potential 2) corrections to\nthe top's width 3) hard gluon correction to $\\gamma t \\bar t$-vertex. These\ncorrections are well-known and were described in the previous papers. We can\nconclude that similar situation takes place for all unstable particles\nthreshold production. This result can be expressed in the form of a general\nstatment: There is no O(${\\alpha}_{QED}$ or ${\\alpha}_{QCD}$) corrections for\nthe total cross-section , originated from the \"jet-jet\" interection.\n", "  We present models that can reconcile the solar and atmospheric neutrino data\nwith the existence of a hot dark matter component in the universe. This dark\nmatter is a quasi-Dirac neutrino whose mass $m_{DM}$ arises at the one-loop\nlevel. The solar neutrino deficit is explained via nonadiabatic conversions of\nelectron neutrino to a sterile neutrino and the atmospheric neutrino data via\nmaximal muon neutrino to tau neutrino oscillations generated by higher order\nloop diagrams. For $m_{DM} \\sim 30$ eV the radiative neutrino decay can lead to\nphotons that can ionize interstellar hydrogen. In one of the models one can\nhave observable $\\nu_e$ to $\\nu_\\tau$ oscillation rates, with no appreciable\nmuon neutrino oscillations at accelerator experiments. In addition, there can\nbe observable rates for tau number violating processes such as $\\tau \\to 3e$\nand $\\tau \\to e + \\gamma$. In the other model one can have sizeable $\\nu_e$ to\n$\\nu_\\mu$ oscillation rates, as well as sizeable rates for muon number\nviolating processes such as $\\mu \\to e + \\gamma$, $\\mu \\to e + majoron$ and\n$\\mu \\to 3e$.\n", "  The dominant production mechanism for ${\\bar b} c$ bound states in high\nenergy processes is the production of a high energy ${\\bar b}$ or $c$ quark,\nfollowed by its fragmentation into the ${\\bar b} c$ state. We calculate the\nfragmentation functions for the production of the S-wave states $B_c$ and\n$B_c^*$ to leading order in the QCD coupling constant. The fragmentation\nprobabilities for ${\\bar b} \\rightarrow B_c$ and ${\\bar b} \\rightarrow B_c^*$\nare approximately $2.2 \\times 10^{-4}$ and $3.1 \\times 10^{-4}$, while those\nfor $c \\rightarrow B_c$ and $c \\rightarrow B_c^*$ are smaller by almost two\norders of magnitude.\n", "  The fine-tuning principles are analyzed in search for predictions of\ntop-quark and Higgs-boson masses. The modification of Veltman condition based\non the compensation between fermion and boson vacuum energies within the\nStandard Model multiplets is proposed. It is supplied with the stability under\nrescaling and with the requirement of minimum for the physical v. e. v. for the\nHiggs field (zero anomalous dimension). Their joint solution for top-quark and\nHiggs-boson couplings exists for the cutoff $\\Lambda \\approx 2.3 \\cdot\n10^{13}\\,GeV$ that yields the low-energy values $m_t = 151 \\pm 4\\,GeV; m_H =\n195 \\pm 7\\,GeV$.\n", "  We reanalyze the extraction of the heavy Higgs boson signal $H\\rightarrow\nW^+W^-\\rightarrow \\bar\\ell\\nu,\\ell\\bar\\nu$ $(\\ell=e\\hbox{ or }\\mu)$ from the\nStandard Model background at hadron supercolliders, taking into account revised\nestimates of the top quark background. With new acceptance criteria the\ndetection of the signal remains viable. Requiring a forward jet-tag, a central\njet-veto, and a large relative transverse momentum of the two charged leptons\nyields $S/\\sqrt B>6$ for one year of running at the SSC or LHC.\n", "  We consider the effective $1+1$-dimensional chiral theory describing\nfluctuations of the order parameter of the Disoriented Chiral Condensate (DCC)\nwhich can be formed in the central rapidity region in a relativistic\nnucleus-nucleus or nucleon-nucleon collisions at high energy. Using\n$1+1$-dimensional reduction of QCD at high energies and assuming spin\npolarization of DDC one can find the Wess-Zumino-Novikov-Witten (WZNW) model at\nlevel $k=3$ as the effective chiral theory for the one-dimensional DDC. Some\npossible phenomenological consequences are briefly discussed.\n", "  Nonrenormalizable couplings in supergravity-coupled supersymmetric theories\ncan give rise to power-law divergences that destabilize the weak-scale\nhierarchy. For the case of the standard-model gauge group, the problem can\narise in theories with \\321 gauge-singlet chiral superfields. The minimal\nsupersymmetric standard model is free from such destabilizing divergences.\n", "  We extend and develop our previous work on the evolution of a network of\ncosmic strings. The new treatment is based on an analysis of the probability\ndistribution of the end-to-end distance of a randomly chosen segment of\nleft-moving string of given length. The description involves three distinct\nlength scales: $\\xi$, related to the overall string density, $\\bar\\xi$, the\npersistence length along the string, and $\\zeta$, describing the small-scale\nstructure, which is an important feature of the numerical simulations that have\nbeen done of this problem. An evolution equation is derived describing how the\ndistribution develops in time due to the combined effects of the universal\nexpansion, of intercommuting and loop formation, and of gravitational\nradiation. With plausible assumptions about the unknown parameters in the\nmodel, we confirm the conclusions of our previous study, that if gravitational\nradiation and small-scale structure effects are neglected, the two dominant\nlength scales both scale in proportion to the horizon size. When the extra\neffects are included, we find that while $\\xi$ and $\\bar\\xi$ grow, $\\zeta$\ninitially does not. Eventually, however, it does appear to scale, at a much\nlower level, due to the effects of gravitational back-reaction.\n", "  We present a one-loop calculation of a gauge invariant QCD beta function.\nUsing both momentum and temperature renormalization group equations we\ninvestigate the running coupling in the magnetic sector as a function of\ntemperature and momentum scale. At fixed momentum scale we find that, in\ncontrast to $\\lambda\\phi^4$ or QED, high-temperature QCD is strongly coupled,\neven after renormalization group improvement. However, if the momentum scale is\nchanged simultaneously with temperature in a specified manner, the coupling\ndecreases. We also point out in what regime dimensional reduction occurs. Both\nthe cases $N_f$ smaller and larger than $\\frac{11}{2} N_c$ are discussed.\n", "  Invited talk at Second Workshop on JINR CTau Factory, Dubna, April 1993,\nupdated version of earlier review given at Second Workshop on Tau Lepton\nPhysics, Ohio, september 1992\n", "  Invited lecture at Int. School on Particles and Cosmology, Baksan Valley,\n1993\n", "  We investigate the sensitivity of total cross sections of $e+p \\rightarrow\nW,Z$ to CP-conserving non-standard $WW\\gamma$ couplings. We include all the\nimportant production mechanisms and study the dependence of the total $W$ cross\nsections on the anomalous $WW\\gamma$ couplings, $\\kappa$ and $\\lambda$. We\nargue that the ratio of $W$ and $Z$ production cross sections is particularly\nwell suited, being relatively insensitive to uncertainties in the theoretical\nand experimental parameters.\n", "  We calculate next-to-leading QCD corrections to the decay $H^+ \\to u\\bar d$\nfor generic up and down quarks in the final state. A recently developed\nalgorithm for evaluation of massive two-loop Feynman diagrams is employed to\ncalculate renormalization constants of the charged Higgs boson. The origin and\nsummation of large logarithmic corrections to the decay rate of the top quark\ninto a lighter charged Higgs boson is also explained.\n", "  A determination of the hadronic fragmentation functions of the Z-boson is\npresented from a study of the inclusive hadron production wit the DELPHI\ndetector at LEP. These fragmentation functions were compared with the ones at\nlower energies, thus covering data in a large kinematic range:\n  196 <= Q^2 <= 8312 GeV^2 and x(= p_h/E_beam) > 0.08\n  A large scaling violation was observed, which was used to extract the strong\ncoupling constant in second order QCD:\n  alpha_s(Mz) =0.118 +\\- 0.005.\n  The corresponding QCD scale for five quark flavours is:\n  Lambda_MS_bar = 230 +/- 60 MeV.\n", "  We analytically compute the flavour singlet ${\\cal O}(\\alpha_s^2\nm_b^2/m_t^2)$ radiative corrections to the partial decay rate\n$\\Gamma(Z\\rightarrow b\\bar{b})$. These corrections arise from anomalous\n``double traingle'' diagrams containing a single $\\gamma_5$ matrix inside each\nof two closed fermion loops. They represent the next-to-leading term of the\nasymptotic expansion in the inverse large top mass. As a byproduct of the\ncalculcation we confirm the results of B.Kniehl and J.H.K\\\"uhn for the flavour\nsinglet massless corrections \\cite{KniKue90} as well as our previous ${\\cal\nO}(\\alpha_s^2 m_b^2/M_Z^2)$ result \\cite{CheKwi93}.\n", "  We consider the quantum state describing the Disoriented Chiral Condensate\n(DCC) which may be produced in high energy collisions. Using the approach\nsuggested by Rajagopal and Wilczek to describe the amplification of the long\nwavelength classical pion modes, we consider the quantum-mechanical evolution\nof the initial vacuum state into the final squeezed state describing the DCC.\nThe obtained wave function has some interesting properties which are discussed.\n", "  It is shown that quantum mechanical systems obtained from a heuristic path\nintegral quantization of lagrangians of the form $ L= \\sum_{n} \\frac{1}{n!}\nf_n(q) \\dot{q}^n $ violate in general the correspondence principle, unless $L$\nis not more than quadratic in $\\dot{q}$. The field theoretic counterpart of\nthis result and its consequence on models of interacting scalar and vector\nfields and particularly the electroweak interactions, are briefly discussed.\n", "  Electroproduction of pions on the nucleon near the threshold is analyzed\nwithin the framework of baryon chiral perturbation theory. We give a thorough\ndiscussion of the low--energy theorems related to charged and neutral\nelectropionproduction. It is shown how the axial radius of the nucleon can be\nrelated to the S--wave multipoles $E_{0+}^{(-)}$ and $L_{0+}^{(-)}$. The chiral\nperturbation theory calculations of the $\\gamma^\\star p \\to \\pi^0 p$ reaction\nare found to be in good agreement with the recent near threshold data. We also\ndiscuss the influence of some isospin--breaking effects in this channel. For\nfuture experimental tests of the underlying chiral dynamics, extensive\npredictions of differential cross sections and multipole amplitudes are\npresented.\n", "  The studies of the electroweak symmetry breaking sector (EWSBS) at\n$\\gamma\\gamma$ colliders were considered previously in the loop processes of\n$\\gamma\\gamma \\to w_Lw_L,\\,z_Lz_L$, but they are suffered from the huge $W_T\nW_T$ and $Z_TZ_T$ backgrounds. Here we present another possible process that\ninvolves spectator $W$'s and $W_L$'s, the latter of which are scattered\nstrongly by the interactions of the EWSBS. We also show that this process\nshould be safe from the transverse backgrounds and it can probe the structure\nof the EWSBS.\n", "  Various theoretical uncertainties in the standard solar model and in the\nMikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein (MSW) analysis are discussed. It is shown that two\nmethods of estimating the solar neutrino flux uncertainties are equivalent: (a)\na simple parametrization of the uncertainties using the core temperature and\nthe nuclear production cross sections; (b) the Monte Carlo method of Bahcall\nand Ulrich. In the MSW analysis, we emphasize proper treatments of correlation\nof theoretical uncertainties between flux components and between different\ndetectors, the Earth effect, and multiple solutions in a combined $\\chi^2$\nprocedure. The MSW solutions for various standard and nonstandard solar models\nare also shown. The MSW predictions of the global solutions for the future\nsolar neutrino experiments are given, emphasizing the measurement of the energy\nspectrum and the day-night effect in Sudbury Neutrino Observatory and\nSuper-Kamiokande to distinguish the two solutions.\n", "  A simple model of Omega_Q and Omega_Q^(*) baryons containing one heavy quark\nQ is constructed. Amplitudes are represented by loop graphs with one line for\nthe heavy quark and another for the light degrees of freedom. The latter are\nmodelled as a freely-propagating vector particle interacting nonlocally with\nthe heavy baryon and a free heavy quark. It is argued that the physics of\nconfinement plays an inessential role in determining semileptonic decay form\nfactors. The model has a well-defined heavy-quark expansion which has a form\nconsistent (through order 1/m_Q) with that determined by QCD through the\nheavy-quark effective theory. The slope of the Isgur-Wise function is\nconsistent with the Bjorken sum rule bound. The effect of the Omega_Q^* -\nOmega_Q mass splitting on the first-order form factors is examined.\n", "  1) We discuss a sum rule of the tensor structure function $b_1(x)$ for\nspin-one hadrons along with the Gottfried sum rule. Both sum rules are similar\nin the sense that they are phenomenological ones based on a naive parton model.\nAs the Gottfried sum rule became useful for studying SU(2)$_{flavor}$ breaking\nin antiquark distributions, the $b_1$ sum rule could provide important\ninformation on sea-quark tensor polarization.\n  2) Pionic contributions to the antiquark distribution $\\bar u-\\bar d$ and\nviolation of the Gottfried sum rule are discussed. We find that the\ncontributions account for about half of the discrepancy found by the New Muon\nCollaboration between their result and the sum rule. In order to distinguish\nvarious theoretical explanations, we need independent experimental tests, for\nexample, by using Drell-Yan processes. As an application of mesonic\ncalculations, the difference between strange and antistrange quark\ndistributions in the nucleon is briefly discussed.\n", "  In Heavy Quark Effective Theory the calculation of form-factors of higher\nexcited states in a non-relativistic framework suffers severe inconsistencies\ndue to frame dependencies. We show how careful inclusion of the Wigner-rotation\nof the spin of the light quark and a covariant description of the meson\nwave-function resolves these inconsistencies. We match this onto HQET and\ncompute the relevant form factors $\\xi_{1/2}$ and $\\xi_{3/2}$ to order $v^2$.\n", "  Consequences of the interference between spectator amplitudes for the\nlifetimes and semileptonic decay fractions of B^0 and B^+ mesons are discussed.\nAssuming duality and constructive interference between spectator amplitudes we\nare able to explain the low experimental value for the semileptonic decay\nfraction of $B$ mesons. Extracting these amplitudes from a fit to 11 exclusive\nhadronic B decay fractions we find\n  a_1 = 1.05 +/- 0.03 +/- 0.10,\n  a_2 =+0.227 +/ 0.012 +/- 0.022,\n  an inclusive semileptonic decay fraction of\n  (11.2 +/- 0.5 +/- 1.7),\n  and a lifetime ratio\n  tau(B^+) / tau(B^0) = 0.83 +/- 0.01 +/- 0.01.\n", "  Next-to-leading $1/\\N$ corrections to the upper bound on $M_{\\eta}/M_{\\eta\n'}$ recently obtained by Georgi are considered. These corrections are just what\nis needed to reconcile the bound with the observed $\\eta$ and $\\eta'$ masses.\n", "  In weakly interacting quark-gluon plasmas diffusion of color is found to be\nmuch slower than the diffusion of spin and flavor because color is easily\nexchanged by the gluons in the very singular forward scattering processes. If\nthe infrared divergence is cut off by a magnetic mass, $m_{mag}\\sim \\alpha_sT$,\nthe color diffusion is $D_{color}\\sim (\\alpha_s\\ln(1/\\alpha_s)T)^{-1}$, a\nfactor $\\alpha_s$ smaller than spin and flavor diffusion. A similar effect is\nexpected in electroweak plasmas above $M_W$ due to $W^\\pm$ exchanges. The color\nconductivity in quark-gluon plasmas and the electrical conductivity in\nelectroweak plasmas are correspondingly small in relativistic heavy ion\ncollisions and the very early universe.\n", "  We show that the currently experimentally preferred values of the top-quark\nmass (\\ie, $130\\lsim m_t\\lsim180\\GeV$) are naturally understood in the context\nof string models, where the top-quark Yukawa coupling at the string scale is\ngenerically given by $\\lambda_t={\\cal O}(g)$, with $g$ the unified gauge\ncoupling. A detailed study of the Yukawa sector of $SU(5)\\times U(1)$\nsupergravity shows that the ratio of the bottom-quark to tau-lepton Yukawa\ncouplings at the string scale is required to be in the range\n$0.7\\lsim\\lambda_b/\\lambda_\\tau\\lsim1$, depending on the values of $m_t$ and\n$m_b$. This result is consistent with $SU(5)\\times U(1)$ symmetry, which does\n{\\em not} require the equality of these Yukawa couplings in the unbroken\nsymmetry phase of the theory. As a means of possibly predicting the value of\n$m_t$, we propose a procedure whereby the size of the allowed parameter space\nis determined as a function of $m_t$, since all sparticle and Higgs-boson\nmasses and couplings depend non-trivially on $m_t$. At present, no significant\npreference for particular values of $m_t$ in $SU(5)\\times U(1)$ supergravity is\nobserved, except that high-precision LEP data requires $m_t\\lsim180\\GeV$.\n", "  The BP-FTW effective action is a good laboratory to study the nature of\nchiral symmetry at high $T$. It is invariant under a new Noether charge,\n$\\Qbeta$. By explicit quantization, performed to order $\\Tprime$ we show that\nthe thermal vacuum is annihilated by $\\Qbeta$, so that the new chiral symmetry\nis not broken spontaneously at high $T$. This high $T$ Noether charge is,\nhowever, different from the usual zero temperature chirality, $\\Q$. Our\nquantization also shows that the thermal vacuum is not annihilated by $\\Q$, so\nthat the old chiral symmetry remains broken at high $T$. The thermal vacuum is\nthus every bit as `structured' and `complex' as the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio vacuum\nat zero temperature. We exhibit the relation between the normal mode expansion\nfor $\\Qbeta$ versus the usual expansion for $\\Q$. In an appendix, we point out\nthe analyticity properties of the fermion propagator in real time formalism,\nand verify the canonical nature of the thermal Green function.\n", "  We study the correlation of photon and charged lepton pseudorapidities,\n$\\eta(\\gamma)$ and $\\eta(\\ell)$, $\\ell=e,\\,\\mu$, in $p\\,\\pbar \\rightarrow\nW^\\pm\\gamma+X\\rightarrow \\ell^\\pm p\\llap/_T\\gamma+X$. In the Standard Model,\nthe $\\Delta\\eta(\\gamma,\\ell)= \\eta(\\gamma) - \\eta(\\ell)$ differential cross\nsection is found to exhibit a pronounced dip at $\\Delta\\eta(\\gamma,\\ell)\n\\approx \\mp 0.3$ ($=0$)in $p\\bar p$ ($pp$) collisions, which originates from\nthe radiation zero present in $q\\bar q'\\rightarrow W\\gamma$. The sensitivity of\nthe $\\Delta\\eta(\\gamma,\\ell)$ distribution to higher order QCD corrections,\nnon-standard $WW\\gamma$ couplings, the $W+$~jet ``fake'' background and the\ncuts imposed is explored. At hadron supercolliders, next-to-leading order QCD\ncorrections are found to considerably obscure the radiation zero. The\nadvantages of the $\\Delta\\eta(\\gamma,\\ell)$ distribution over other quantities\nwhich are sensitive to the radiation zero are discussed. We conclude that\nphoton lepton rapidity correlations at the Tevatron offer a {\\it unique}\nopportunity to search for the Standard Model radiation zero in hadronic\n$W\\gamma$ production.\n", "  The implications of the recent measurement of the left-right asymmetry,\n$A_{LR}$, by the SLD Collaboration for theories with extended gauge sectors is\nexamined. We show that it is possible to arrange for large, negative values of\n$S$, based on an analysis of leptonic data, without serious side effects for\nother observables in certain classes of models. The implications of such\nscenarios for future measurements on the $Z$ peak, at the Tevatron, and for\natomic parity violation experiments are examined.\n", "  Properties of cumulant- and combinant ratios are studied for multihadron\nfinal states composed of Poisson distributed clusters. The application of these\nquantities to ``detect'' clusters is discussed. For the scaling laws which hold\nin hierarchical clustering models (void scaling, combinant scaling) a\ngeneralization is provided. It is shown that testing hierarchical models is\nmeaningful only for phase-space volumes not larger than the characteristic\ncorrelation length introduced by Poisson superposition. Violation of the\nscaling laws due to QCD effects is predicted.\n", "  We have reexamined the elastic pion form factor over a broad range of\nmomentum transfers with the mass evolution from current quark to constituent\nquark being taken into account. We have also studied the effect of Sudakov form\nfactors, of anomalous quark magnetic moments and of alternative soft wave\nfunctions. Our calculation shows a power-law falloff from the present\nexperimental values to near-asymptotic values in the few $GeV^{2}$ range.\n", "  Classical considerations suggest that the probability distribution $P(R)$,\nwhere $R$ is the ratio of neutral pions to total pions emitted from a\ndisoriented chiral condensate (which has been hypothesized to form in heavy ion\nreactions) is $R^{-1/2}/2$. Quantum mechanical isospin correlations between the\ncondensate and the remainder of the system can alter this. Moments of the P(R)\ndistribution can be expressed in terms of expectation values of $(I^2/N^2)^m$\nwhere $I$ is the isospin carried by the condensate, $N$ is the number of pions\nemitted and m is an arbitrary integer. We find that the probability\ndistribution is very similar to the classical distribution for $0.1 < R < 0.9$\nunless the isospin carried by the condensate is very large.\n", "  I present the contribution of gluinos and scalar quarks to the decay rate of\nthe top quark into a charged Higgs boson and a bottom quark within the minimal\nsupersymmetric standard model, including the mixing of the scalar partners of\nthe left- and right-handed top quark. I show that for certain values of the\nsupersymmetric parameters the standard QCD loop corrections to this decay mode\nare diminished or enhanced by several 10 per cent. I show that not only a small\nvalue of 3 GeV for the gluino mass (small mass window) but also much larger\nvalues of several hundreds of GeV's have a non-neglible effect on this decay\nrate, against general belief. Last but not least, if the ratio of the vacuum\nexpectation values of the Higgs bosons are taken in the limit of $v_1\\ll v_2$ I\nobtain a drastic enhancement due to a $\\tan\\beta$\\ dependence in the couplings.\n", "  The S and P wave $\\pi \\pi$ phase shifts are recalculated in terms of two\nphenomenological parameters using the one loop CPTh and the elastic unitarity\ncondition. Using these phase shifts, the vector and scalar form factors are\ncalculated and shown to be in a good agreement with experimental data. It is\nfound that the simpler and more phenomenological approach, where the left hand\ncut contributions to the partial wave amplitude are neglected, yields\napproximately the same result.\n", "  A simple method to calculate the total annihilation cross section of massive\ncold relics is presented. Exact expressions for $\\arel$, $\\brel$, and $\\crel$\nof $\\sigma \\vrel=\\arel+\\brel \\vrel^2+\\crel \\vrel^4$ are obtained from simple\nderivatives of the squared annihilation amplitude. Three examples are given. In\none example, the computed annihilation cross section of massive Dirac neutrinos\nconfirms recent correct calculations.\n", "  The QCD sum rule is applied to the H dibaryon and is compared to the flavor\nnon-singlet di-nucleon. We find that the H dibaryon is almost degenerate to the\ndi-nucleon in the $SU(3)_{flavor}$ limit and therefore is not deeply bound as\nfar as th\\ e threshold parameter is adjusted not to have a di-nucleon bound\nstate. After introducing the $SU(3)_{f}$ breaking effects, the H dibaryon is\nfound to be bound by $40 MeV$ below the $\\Lambda \\Lambda$ threshold.\n", "  High energy particles are produced by the annihilation of dark matter\nparticles in our galaxy. These are presently searched for using balloon-borne\nantiproton and positron detectors and large area, deep underground neutrino\ntelescopes. Dark matter particles, trapped inside the sun, are an abundant\nsource of such neutrinos.\n  From both the cosmological and particle physics points of view the lightest,\nstable supersymmetric particle or neutralino is arguably the leading dark\nmatter candidate. Its mass is bracketed by a minimum value of order a few tens\nof GeV, determined from unsuccessful accelerator searches, and a maximum value\nof order 1~TeV imposed by particle physics as well as cosmological constraints.\nBack-of-the-envelope calculations are sufficient to demonstrate how present\nneutrino telescopes are competitive with existing and future particle colliders\nsuch as the LHC in the search for supersymmetry. We emphasize that a $1\\,\\rm\nkm^2$ area is the natural scale for a future instrument capable of probing the\nfull GeV--TeV neutralino mass range by searching for high energy neutrinos\nproduced by their annihilation in the sun.\n", "  We describe a class of supersymmetric unified models with the following\nproperties:\n  i) the full breaking of the gauge group is achieved by Higgs fields in the\nfundamental representation;\n  ii) the correct unification of the strong and electroweak coupling constants\nis obtained without the need of any intermediate scale;\n  iii) the problems of the doublet-triplet splitting and of the proton decay at\ndimension-5 level may receive a natural solution.\n  The models, other than being interesting unified field theories per se, may\nconstitute examples of string-derivable GUTs.\n", "  The present status of the solar neutrino problem is reviewed. The strongest\nmotivation for new neutrino physics comes from the complete phenomenological\nfailure of astrophysical solutions: (1) The standard solar model is excluded by\neach of the solar neutrino experiments. (2) The combined results of Homestake\nand Kamiokande are incompatible with any astrophysical solution. (3) Even if\nthe Homestake results were ignored entirely, there is no realistic solar model\nso far that describes the Kamiokande and gallium data simultaneously within\ntheir experimental uncertainties. On the other hand, the MSW solutions provide\na complete description of the data, strongly hinting at the existence of mass\nand mixing of neutrinos. The MSW predictions for the future experiments are\ngiven in detail. It is stressed that solar model uncertainties are significant\nin determining the oscillation parameters and in making predictions for the\nfuture experiments. Especially, a $^8$B flux (or $S_{17}$) smaller by 20\\% than\nthat of the Bahcall-Pinsonneault model can make the interpretation of the\ncharged to neutral current ratio measurement in SNO ambiguous.\n", "  The contribution of a neutrino magnetic moment $\\mu_{\\nu}$ to the cross\nsection of the process $\\nu e^{-}\\rightarrow \\nu e^{-} \\gamma $ has been\ncalculated and compared with the Standard Electroweak one. The radiative\nprocess allows to reach low enough values of $Q^2$ without the need to operate\nat very small energies of recoil electrons. Regions in the phase space which\nare more favourable to set bounds on $\\mu_{\\nu}$ are suggested.\n", "  In the standard framework of non-equilibrium quantum field theories, the\npinch singularities associated to multiple products of $\\delta$-functions do\nnot cancel in a perturbative expansion unless the particle distributions are\nthose for a system in thermal and chemical equilibrium.\n", "  {}From Class I decays : $B^o \\ra \\pi^+ ( \\rho^+ ) + D^- ( {D^*}^- )$, we\ndetermine $a_1$, and from Class III decays : $B^+ \\ra \\pi^+ ( \\rho^+ ) +\n\\ol{D}^o ( {\\ol{D}^*}^o )$, we determine an allowed domain in the $( a_1, a_2\n)$ plane. We find that within one standard deviation errors, the allowed band\nof $a_1$ from Class I decays is at least three standard deviations removed from\nthe allowed domain $( a_1, a_2 )$ from Class III decays.If we expand the\nexperimental errors to two standard deviations we do find a small intersection\nbetween the $a_1$ band and the allowed $( a_1, a_2 )$ domain. The results\nusually quoted in the literature lie in this intersection. We suggest : (1) an\nindependent measurement of the branching ratio for the Class III decay, $B^+\n\\ra \\rho^+ \\ol{D}^o $, (2) a high-statistics measurement of the branching ratio\nof the Class I decay, $B \\ra \\ol{D} ( \\ol{D}^* ) + D_s ( D_s^* )$ in both\ncharged states, and (3) a measurement of the longitudinal polarization fraction\nin the Class III decay $B^+ \\ra \\rho^+ {\\ol{D}^*}^o $ to shed more light on the\nquestions involved .\n", "  We have examined how a Standard Model or Supersymmetric Higgs boson h might\nbe detected at possible hadron colliders. The channels W(to ell nu)h(to b b~),\nZ(to ell ell~)h(to b b~) and W/Z(to jets)h(to tau+ tau-) are most useful. The\nresults imply that h with mass M_h can be detected or excluded for M_h between\nabout 80--130 GeV at any hadron collider with energy greater or similar to 2\nTeV and an integrated luminosity greater or similar to 10 fb^{-1}; high\nluminosity is the essential requirement. We comment on measuring $h$ couplings\nand branching ratios.\n", "  We point out that combinations of parameters that predict large counting\nrates in experiments searching for supersymmetric dark matter often tend to\npredict a very large branching ratio for the inclusive decay \\bsg. The recent\nmeasurement of this branching ratio, therefore, indicates that searches for\nsupersymmetric dark matter might be even more difficult than previously\nanticipated.\n", "  In T.Zhang, L.Xiao and R.Koniuk, Can. J. Phys. {\\bf 70}, 670 (1992), a new\nmethod was developed to calculate energy levels in QED nonrelativistic bound\nstates, up to order m \\alpha^5. Whether or not this method could be used beyond\nthis order was left as an open question. In this paper, we answer this question\nwith the help of a nonrelativistic effective field theory, NRQED. We find that,\naside from infrared terms which had to be discarded without justification in\nZhang et al, the order m \\alpha^4 and m \\alpha^5 calculations give the same\nresults in both methods. It is shown, however, that this is due to the special\nphysical origin of these contributions and that the method of Zhang et al would\nnot give the right answer at order m \\alpha^6 or higher. The separation of\nscale provided by NRQED is essential to the derivation of this result.\n", "  The general behaviour of perturbation series in non-equilibrium scalar field\ntheory is analysed in some detail, with a particular emphasis on the\n``pathological terms'', generated by multiple products of $\\delta$-functions.\nUsing an intuitive regularization method, it is shown that these terms give\nlarge contributions at all orders, even when considering small deviations from\nequilibrium. Fortunately, these terms can also be resummed and I give the\ngeneral expressions for the resummed propagators in non-equilibrium scalar\nfield theory, regardless of the size of deviations from equilibrium.\n", "  We evaluate S_{APQCD}, the Abelian projection QCD(APQCD) action\nnonperturbatively on the lattice. For SU(2), we find S_{APQCD} at strong\ncoupling is essentially the compact QED(CQED) action. At weaker coupling, we\nfind S_{APQCD} mutates: it gains additional operators, including an exogenous\nNEGATIVE magnetic monopole mass shift. As a corollary, since monopoles are\ncondensed in CQED our results prove (vicariously) that SU(2) monopoles are\ncondensed. S_{APQCD} for SU(3) has similar behavior.\n", "  In the events of the type $e^+e^- \\rightarrow W^+W^- \\rightarrow$ 4 jets,\n$e^+e^- \\rightarrow t\\bar{t} \\rightarrow bW^+\\bar{b}W^-$, particle production\ncould depend in a non-trivial way on the kinematics of the process. It is shown\nthat QCD interference effects are negligible for energetic perturbative\nemission, but soft perturbative gluons and non-perturbative fragmentation could\ninduce colour correlations. Possible consequences for LEP 2 and NLC events are\nbriefly addressed.\n", "  We point out the following astrophysical consequences of a tau neutrino with\nmass in the MeV range:\n  (i) if it has a small electric charge which will allow it to become a cold\ndark matter of the universe, then present limits on the 511 KeV gamma ray line\nrule out the possibility that it contributes an $\\Omega_{\\nu_{\\tau}}$ between\n.1 to 1 making it unsuitable as a cold dark matter candidate;\n  (ii) if an electrically neutral MeV range $\\nu_{\\tau}$ decays to $\\nu_e +\n\\chi$ ( where $\\chi$ is a massless boson) , then its lifetime is bounded by\nSN1987A observations to be within a window $.05~~sec.\\leq \\tau(\\nu_{\\tau})~\\leq\n300~sec./(m_{\\nu_{\\tau}}~in~ MeV)$ a range which may be of interest from the\npoint of view of structure formation.\n  Encouraged by the overlap between the range allowed in (ii) above and that\nrequired for a proposed structure formation mechanism by Dodelson et al., we\nsearch for simple extensions of the standard model, where such masses and\nlifetimes may arise for natural values of parameters and show that the already\nexisting singlet majoron and low scale left-right models have this property. We\nalso comment on possible familon models for this decay.\n", "  The non-equilibrium dynamics of the first stage of the reheating process,\nthat is dissipation via particle production is studied in scalar field theories\nin the unbroken and in the broken symmetry phase. We begin with a perturbative\nstudy to one loop and show explicitly that the mechanism of dissipation via\nparticle production cannot be explained with a simple derivative term in the\nequation of motion. The dissipative contribution is non-local and there does\nnot exist a local (Markovian) limit at zero temperature. Furthermore, we show\nthat both an amplitude as well as a one-loop calculation present instabilities,\nrequiring a non-perturbative resummation. Within the same approximations, we\nstudy an O(2) linear sigma model that allows to study dissipation by Goldstone\nbosons.\n  We find infrared divergences that require non-perturbative resummation in\norder to understand the long-time dynamics. We obtain a perturbative\n  Langevin equation that exhibits a generalized fluctuation-dissipation\nrelation, with non-Markovian kernels and colored noise. We then study a\n  Hartree approximation and clearly exhibit dissipative effects related to the\nthresholds to particle production. The asymptotic dynamics depends on the\ncoupling and initial conditions but does not seem to lead to exponential\nrelaxation. The effect of dissipation by Goldstone bosons is studied\nnon-perturbatively in the large N limit in an O(N) theory. Dissipation produced\nby Goldstone bosons dramatically changes the picture of the phase transition.\nWe find the remarkable result that for ``slow-roll'' initial conditions (with\nthe expectation value of the field initially near the origin) the final value\nof the expectation value of the scalar field is very close to its initial\nvalue. We find that the minima of the effective action depend on the initial\nconditions. We provide extensive numerical analysis of the dynamics.\n", "  The A-dependence of the quasielastic A(e,e'p) reaction has been studied at\nSLAC with H-2, C, Fe, and Au nuclei at momentum transfers Q^2 = 1, 3, 5, and\n6.8 (GeV/c)^2. We extract the nuclear transparency T(A,Q^2), a measure of the\naverage probability that the struck proton escapes from the nucleus A without\ninteraction. Several calculations predict a significant increase in T with\nmomentum transfer, a phenomenon known as Color Transparency. No significant\nrise within errors is seen for any of the nuclei studied.\n", "  We use Heavy Quark Effective Theory (HQET) techniques to parametrize certain\nnon-perturbative effects related to quantum fluctuations that put both heavy\nquark and antiquark in quarkonium almost on shell.\n  The large off-shell momentum contributions are calculated using Coulomb type\nstates. The almost on-shell momentum contributions are evaluated using an\neffective 'chiral' lagrangian which incorporates the relevant symmetries of the\nHQET for quarks and antiquarks. The cut-off dependence of both contributions\nmatches perfectly. The decay constants and the matrix elements of bilinear\ncurrents at zero recoil are calculated. The new non-perturbative contributions\nfrom the on-shell region are parametrized by a single constant. They turn out\nto be $O(\\alpha^2/\\Lambda_{QCD} a_{n})$, $a_{n}$ being the Bohr radius and\n$\\alpha$ the strong coupling constant, times the non-perturbative contribution\ncoming from the multipole expansion (gluon condensate). We discuss the physical\napplications to $\\Upsilon$, $J/\\Psi$ and $B_{c}$ systems.\n", "  Recent improvements of the hard scattering picture for the large $p_{\\perp}$\nbehaviour of electromagnetic form factors, namely the inclusion of both Sudakov\ncorrections and intrinsic transverse momentum dependence of the hadronic wave\nfunction, are reviewed. On account of these improvements the perturbative\ncontributions to the pion's and the nucleon's form factor can be calculated in\na theoretically self-consistent way for momentum transfers as low as about $2$\nand $3\\,{\\rm GeV}$, respectively. This is achieved at the expense of a\nsubstantial suppression of the perturbative contribution in the few GeV region.\nEventual higher twist contributions are discussed in some detail.\n", "  Besides the opportunity for discovering new neutrino physics, solar neutrino\nmeasurements provide a sensitive probe of the solar interior, and thus a\nrigorous test of solar model predictions. We present model independent\ndeterminations of the neutrino spectrum by using relevant flux components as\nfree parameters subject only to the luminosity constraint. (1) Without the\nMikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein (MSW) effect, the best fit for the combined data\nis poor. Furthermore, the data indicate a severe suppression of the $^7$Be flux\nrelative to the $^8$B, contradicting both standard and nonstandard solar models\nin general; the $pp$ flux takes its maximum value allowed by the luminosity\nconstraint. This pathology consistently appears even if we ignore any one of\nthe three data. (2) In the presence of the two-flavor MSW effect, the current\nconstraint on the initial $^8$B flux is weak, but consistent with the SSM and\nsufficient to exclude nonstandard models with small $^8$B fluxes. No meaningful\nconstraint is obtained for the other fluxes. In the future, even allowing MSW,\nthe $^8$B and $^7$Be fluxes can be determined at the $\\pm$(15 -- 20)\\% level,\nmaking competing solar models distinguishable. We emphasize that the neutral\ncurrent sensitivity for $^7$Be neutrinos in BOREXINO, HELLAZ, and HERON is\nessential for determining the initial fluxes. The constraints on the MSW\nparameters in the model independent analysis are also discussed.\n", "  The one-to-one connection between the eikonal phase and the ratio of the\nelastic and total cross section is shown. Based on new experimental data of\nCollaboration CDF we analyzed intercept and power of the logarithmic growth of\nthe Born and total Pomeron amplitude.\n", "  Based on the factorization approach, we show that the CLEO data for the ratio\n$\\Gamma(B\\to\\psi K^*)/\\Gamma(B\\to \\psi K)$ and the CDF measurement of the\nfraction of longitudinal polarization in $B\\to\\psi K^*$ can be accounted for by\nthe heavy-flavor-symmetry approach for heavy-light form factors provided that\nthe form factor $F_0$ behaves as a constant, while the $q^2$ dependence is of\nthe monopole form for $F_1,~ A_0,~A_1$, and of the dipole behavior for $A_2$\nand $V$. This $q^2$ extrapolation for form factors is further supported by\n$B\\to K^*\\gamma$ data and by a recent QCD-sum-rule analysis. We then apply this\nmethod to $B\\to D(D^*)\\pi(\\rho)$ decays to extract the parameters $a_1$ and\n$a_2$. It is found that $a_1(B\\to D^{(*)}\\pi(\\rho))=1.01\\pm 0.06$ and $a_2(B\\to\nD^{(*)}\\pi(\\rho))=0.23\\pm 0.06\\,$. Our result $a_2/a_1=0.22\\pm 0.06$ thus\nsignificantly improves the previous analysis that leads to $a_2/a_1=0.23\\pm\n0.11$. We argue that, contrary to what anticipated from the leading $1/N_c$\nexpansion, the sign of $a_2(B\\to\\psi\\K)$ should be positive and\n$a_2(B\\to\\psi\\K)~{\\large ^>_\\sim}~ a_2(B\\to D^{(*)}\\pi(\\rho))$.\n", "  A scheme is developed which shows how one would, given a light-front\nHamiltonian for QCD, extract the $Q\\overline{Q}$ potential, i.e. the quantity\nwhich corresponds to the potential between two infinitely heavy quarks in a\nrest frame, from a light-front calculation. The resulting potential will in\ngeneral depend on the direction along which the infinitely heavy sources are\nseparated and thus provides a direct probe of violations of rotational\ninvariance in a physical observable. Furthermore, easy comparison to data from\n$c\\overline{c}$ and $b\\overline{b}$ spectroscopy and to lattice data is\npossible. The scheme may thus be very helpful in constructing a light-front\nHamiltonian through an iterative procedure.\n", "  The process $p\\,\\pbar \\rightarrow W^{\\pm}Z + X \\rightarrow \\ell^\\pm_1 \\nu_1\n\\ell_2^+ \\ell_2^- + X$ is calculated to ${\\cal O}(\\alpha_s)$ for general $C$\nand $P$ conserving $WWZ$ couplings. At the Tevatron center of mass energy, the\nQCD corrections to $WZ$ production are modest. At Large Hadron Collider (LHC)\nenergies, the inclusive QCD corrections are large, but can be reduced\nsignificantly if a jet veto is imposed. Sensitivity limits for the anomalous\n$WWZ$ couplings are derived from the next-to-leading order $Z$ boson transverse\nmomentum distribution for Tevatron and LHC energies. Unless a jet veto is\nimposed, next-to-leading order QCD corrections decrease the sensitivity to\nanomalous $WWZ$ couplings considerably at LHC energies, but have little\ninfluence at the Tevatron. We also study, at next-to-leading order, rapidity\ncorrelations between the $W$ and $Z$ decay products, and the $ZZ/WZ$ and\n$WZ/W\\gamma$ cross section ratios. These quantities are found to be useful\ntools in searching for the approximate zero present in the Standard Model $WZ$\nhelicity amplitudes. The prospects for observing the approximate amplitude zero\nat the Tevatron and the LHC are critically assessed.\n", "  We present results from a study of subtractive renormalization of the fermion\npropagator Dyson-Schwinger equation (DSE) in massive strong-coupling quenched\nQED$_4$. Results are compared for three different fermion-photon proper vertex\n{\\it Ans\\\"{a}tze\\/}: bare $\\gamma^\\mu$, minimal Ball-Chiu, and\nCurtis-Pennington. The procedure is straightforward to implement and\nnumerically stable. This is the first study in which this technique is used and\nit should prove useful in future DSE studies, whenever renormalization is\nrequired in numerical work.\n", "  We compute the free energy density for gauge theories, with fermions, at high\ntemperature and zero chemical potential. Specifically, we analytically compute\nthe free energy through $O(g^4)$, which requires the evaluation of three-loop\ndiagrams. This computation extends our previous result for pure gauge QCD.\n", "  Review at session Pa7, Glasgow ICHEP conference\n", "  The evolution of the pion distribution amplitude in next-to-leading order is\nstudied for a fixed and a running coupling constant. In both cases, the\nevolution provides a logarithmic modification in the endpoint region. Assuming\na simple parameterization of the distribution amplitude at a scale of $Q_0\\sim\n0.5\\ \\rm GeV$, it is shown numerically that these effects are large enough at\n$Q\\sim 2\\ \\rm GeV$ that they have to be taken into account in the\nnext-to-leading-order analysis for exclusive processes. Alternatively, by\nintroducing a new distribution amplitude that evolves more smoothly, this\nlogarithmic modification can be included in the hard-scattering part of the\nconsidered process.\n", "  It is shown how the S-matrix pinch technique may be extended to the cases of\nexternal scalar and gauge boson fields. Using this extension, the universality\nof the pinch technique gauge-independent one-loop gauge boson self-energy in a\ngeneral unbroken SU($N$) gauge theory is demonstrated explicitly.\n", "  Lagrangian of a massive particle with spin 3/2 is considered in the\nRarita-Schwinger formalism. We discuss implications of the contact- and the\ngauge-transformation on the physical content of free and interacting theories.\nIt is shown that the ``contact-invariance'' is trivial and has no physical\nrelevance. The requirement of the gauge-invariance of the free lagrangian fixes\nthe off-shell lower-spin content of the spin-3/2 field. The gauge-invariance of\nthe interaction lagrangian insures that these lower-spin components are not\ncoupled, and (probably always) leads to theories consistent with local\ncausality.\n", "  We analyze new QCD sum rules for the pion wave function $\\phi_{\\pi}(x)$,\nobtained recently by A.V. Radyushkin in the framework of the non-local vacuum\ncondensates method for non-diagonal correlators, and suggest a new approach for\nextracting wave functions of the $\\pi$-meson and of its first resonances. As a\nresult we obtain approximately the same form of the pion wave function by using\ntwo different methods and for two different ansatzes of non-local quark\ncondensates. We predict the mass of the $\\pi'$-resonance and obtain the form of\nits wave function. The first method uses integrated (in a sense) properties of\nansatzes and may be considered as an alternative to traditional borel SR.\n", "  The status of coupling constant unification in standard supersymmetric SU(5)\nmodel and its extensions is discussed. Taking into account uncertainties\nrelated with the initial coupling constants and threshold corrections at low\nand high scales we find that in supersymmetric SU(5) model the scale of\nsupersymmetry breaking could be up to $10^8$ Gev. In the extensions of standard\nSU(5) model it is possible to increase the supersymmetry breaking scale up to\n$10^{11}$ Gev.\n", "  We give a nonperturbative derivation of the Bethe--Salpeter equation based on\nthe Feynman--Schwinger path integral representation of the one--particle\npropagator in an external field. We apply the method to the quark--antiquark\nsystem in scalar QCD and obtain a confining BS equation assuming the Wilson\narea law in the straight line approximation. The result is strictly related to\nthe relativistic flux tube model and to the $q \\bar{q}$ semirelativistic\npotential.\n", "  We discuss the problem of estimating the characteristic length scale\n$\\xi_{\\rm s}$, and hence the initial density, of a system of cosmic strings\nformed at a continuous, second-order phase transition in the early universe. In\nparticular, we examine the roles of the correlation length (or string width)\n$\\xi_{\\rm c}$ and the Ginzburg length $\\xi_{\\rm G}$ which defines the\n``fuzziness'' of long strings. We argue that strings acquire a clear identity\nonly once $\\xi_{\\rm s}$ exceeds both $\\xi_{\\rm c}$ and $\\xi_{\\rm G}$, and\nestimate its magnitude at that time.\n", "  QCD equations for generating functionals are solved at coinciding momenta of\nparticles. As a result, the relations for $q$-particle correlation functions at\nequal momenta are obtained. They are directly connected to previously derived\nresults about the factorial and cumulant moments of multiplicity distributions.\nIt is predicted that the correlations at coinciding points decrease, first, as\na function of the rank $q$, and then start oscillating when represented in a\nform of the ratio of cumulant to factorial correlations. In particular, the\ncumulant function of the fifth rank should become negative at the origin. Some\nexperimental data are discussed.\n", "  Preliminary remarks, theoretical scenarios, cosmological constraints,\ncouplings of very heavy neutrinos, production mechanisms and detection,\nsummary.\n", "  The description of baryons as chiral solitons of the Nambu--Jona--Lasinio\n(NJL) model is reviewed. A motivation for the soliton description of baryons is\nprovided from large $N_C$ QCD. Rigorous results on the spontaneous breaking of\nchiral symmetry in QCD are discussed. It is then argued that the NJL model\nprovides a fair description of low--energy hadron physics. The NJL model is\ntherefore employed to mimic the low--energy chiral flavor dynamics of QCD. The\nmodel is bosonized by functional integral techniques and the physical content\nof the emerging effective meson theory is discussed. In particular, its\nrelation to the Skyrme model is established. The static soliton solutions of\nthe bosonized NJL model are found, their properties discussed, and the\ninfluence of various meson fields studied. These considerations provide strong\nsupport of Witten's conjecture that baryons can be understood as soliton\nsolutions of effective meson theories. The chiral soliton of the NJL model is\nthen quantized in a semiclassical fashion and various static properties of the\nnucleon are studied. The dominating $1/N_C$ corrections to the semiclassically\nquantized soliton are investigated. Time--dependent meson fluctuations off the\nchiral soliton are explored and employed to estimate the quantum corrections to\nthe soliton mass. Finally, hyperons are described as chiral solitons of the NJL\nmodel. This is done in both, the collective rotational approach of Yabu and\nAndo as well as in the bound state approach of Callan and Klebanov.\n", "  We calculate the Coulomb effects on the cross section for e+ e- --> W+ W-\ntaking into account the instability of the W bosons. We carefully explain the\nconsequences of instability throughout the energy range which will be\naccessible at LEP2. We present a formula which allows these effects to be\neasily implemented.\n", "  At LEP~1, cross sections and cross section asymmetries may be analysed model\nindependently. Cross sections depend on four, asymmetries on two free\nparameters. As an example, I discuss the model independent $Z$ boson mass\ndetermination from the $Z$ line shape and compare it to the Standard Model\napproach.\n", "  The classification of the hydrodynamical growth mechanisms for the spherical\nbubbles of the low-temperature phase in cosmological phase transitions is\ncompleted by showing that the bubbles can grow as supersonic deflagrations.\nSuch deflagrations consist of a Jouguet deflagration, followed by a rarefaction\nwave. Depending on the amount of supercooling, the maximal velocity of\nsupersonic deflagrations varies between the sound and the light velocities. The\nsolutions faster than supersonic deflagrations are weak detonations.\n", "  We study the potential benefits of an iodine-based solar-neutrino detector\nfor testing hypotheses that involve neutrino oscillations. We argue that such a\ndetector will have a good chance of distinguishing the two allowed regions of\n$\\Delta m^2$ -- $\\sin^22\\theta$ parameter space if neutrino conversion is\noccurring in the sun. It should also be able to detect seasonal variations in\nthe signal due to vacuum oscillations and might be sensitive enough to detect\nday/night variations due to MSW transitions in the earth. Although it would\nneed to be calibrated, a working iodine detector could be completed before more\nambitious projects that seek to accomplish the same things.\n", "  We recently showed that a new gauge boson $\\gamma_B$ coupling only to baryon\nnumber is phenomenologically allowed, even if $m_B<m_Z$ and $\\alpha_B \\approx\n0.2$. In our previous work we assumed that kinetic mixing between the baryon\nnumber and hypercharge gauge bosons (via an $F^{\\mu\\nu}_B F_{\\mu\\nu}^Y$ term)\nwas small enough to evade constraints from precision electroweak measurements.\nIn this paper we propose a class of models in which this term is naturally\nabsent above the electroweak scale. We show that the generation of a mixing\nterm through radiative corrections in the low-energy effective theory does not\nlead to conflict with precision electroweak measurements and may provide a\nleptonic signal for models of this type at an upgraded Tevatron.\n", "  We propose a method to extract the ratio $|V_{ts}/V_{td}|^2$ from a\nmeasurement of $\\Delta \\Gamma/\\Gamma$ for the $B_s$ meson. This method is\nexperimentally more sensitive than the conventional method for large values of\n$|V_{ts}|$ but depends on the accuracy of parton level calculations.\n", "  We calculate the decay rate for inclusive $B \\rightarrow {\\tau}{\\nu}X$ decays\nin a two Higgs doublet model using heavy quark expansion and operator product\nexpansion. Combined with the recent measurement of Br($B \\ra \\tau \\nu X$), we\nfind a limit $\\tan \\beta < 0.58 m_H/\\mbox{GeV}$ at 90\\%\\ C.L..\n", "  Supergravity models are constructed in which the effective low energy theory\ncontains only ``super-soft'' explicit supersymmetry breaking: masses of the\nscalars and pseudoscalars within a multiplet are split in opposite directions.\nWith this form of supersymmetry breaking the radiative corrections of the\nmatter sector to the vacuum energy are bounded by ${\\cal O} (M^4_{Susy})$ to\nall orders in perturbation theory, and we require $Str M^2 = 0$ including the\nhidden sector. The models are based on K\\\"ahler potentials obtained in recent\norbifold compactifications, and we describe the construction of realistic\ntheories.\n", "  We show that LEPII will either discover charginos and neutralinos, or enable\na very stringent upper limit to be placed on $\\tan \\beta$ as a function of the\ngluino mass. The only assumption we make is the existence of some unified model\nwhich breaks down to the minimal supersymmetric standard model below the\nunification scale. In such a framework we discuss how the discovery of a\nchargino at LEPII and the measurement of its mass and production cross-section,\ntogether with the measurement of the mass of the lightest neutralino, would\nenable the gluino mass, $\\tan \\beta$ and $\\mu$ to be predicted, up to a\npossible ambiguity in the sign of $\\mu$ which we discuss.\n", "  The next-to-leading order contribution $\\d\\P\\omn (\\o ,\\vc q )$ to the\npolarization function of the hot gluon system is analysed at non-zero wave\nvectors $\\vc q \\,$. Using Braaten-Pisarski resummation and general covariant\ngauges, $\\d\\P\\omn$ is found to be gauge-fixing independent and transverse on\nthe longitudinal mass-shell. The real part of the longitudinal component\n$\\d\\P_\\ell$ is UV and IR stable (for real $q$). At imaginary $q$ it is IR\nsingular, and at the point $\\o=0$, $q^2=-3m^2$ it coincides with the result of\nRebhan for next-to-leading order Debye screening. When $q$ approaches the\nlightcone, $\\d\\P_\\ell $ diverges like $1 / \\wu {\\o^2 - q^2} $, reflecting the\nbreakdown of the Braaten-Pisarski decomposition scheme in this limit.\n", "  We consider the structure of effective lagrangians describing the low-energy\ndynamics of supersymmetric theories in which a global symmetry $G$ is\nspontaneously broken to a subgroup $H$ while supersymmetry is unbroken. In\naccordance with the supersymmetric Goldstone theorem, these lagrangians contain\nNambu--Goldstone superfields associated with a coset space $G^c / \\hat{H}$,\nwhere $G^c$ is the complexification of $G$ and $\\hat{H}$ is the largest\nsubgroup of $G^c$ that leaves the order parameter invariant. The lagrangian may\nalso contain additional light matter fields. To analyze the effective\nlagrangian for the matter fields, we first consider the case where the\neffective lagrangian is obtained by integrating out heavy modes at weak\ncoupling (but including non-perturbative effects such as instantons). We show\nthat the superpotential of the matter fields is $\\hat{H}$ invariant, which can\ngive rise to non-trivial relations among independent $H$-invariants in the\nsuperpotential. We also show that the Kahler potential of the matter fields can\nbe restricted by a remnant of $\\hat{H}$ symmetry. These results are\nnon-perturbative and have a simple group-theoretic interpretation. When we\nrelax the weak-coupling constraint, there appear to be additional possibilities\nfor the action of $\\hat{H}$ on the matter fields, hinting that the constraints\nimposed by $\\hat{H}$ may be even richer in strongly coupled theories.\n", "  We reanalyse the time evolution of the $K^0-\\bar{K^0}$ system in the language\nof certain spectral function whose Fourier transforms give the time dependent\nsurvival and transition amplitudes. The reanalysis turned out to be necessary\nin view of the astonishing theorem by Khalfin on the possibility of vacuum\nregeneration of $K_S$ and $K_L$. The main reason for this unexpected behaviour\nis the non-orthogonality of $\\ks$ and $\\kl$. As a result of this theorem new\ncontributions to the well known oscillatory terms will enter the time dependent\ntransition probabilities. These new terms are not associated with small/large\ntime behaviour of the amplitudes and therefore their magnitude is apriori\nunknown. Approximating the spectral functions by an one-pole ansatz Khalfin\nestimated the new effect in transition probabilities to be $4 \\times 10^{-4}$.\nWhereas we agree with Khalfin on the general existence of vacuum regeneration\nof $K_S$ and $K_L$ we disagree on the size of the effect. A careful analysis of\nthe one-pole approximation reveals that the effect is eleven orders of\nmagnitude smaller than Khalfin's estimate and, in principle, its exact\ndetermination lies outside the scope of the one-pole ansatz. The present paper\ngives also insight into the limitation of the validity of one-pole\napproximation, not only for small/large time scales, but also for intermediate\ntimes where new effects, albeit small, are possible. It will be shown that the\nsame validity restrictions apply to the known formulae of Weisskopf-Wigner\napproximation as well.\n", "  In this talk I briefly explain the concept of the structure function of a\nphoton (the best known boson). Then I review some of the current experimental\nevidence which confirms the existence of `strong' interactions of photon\nsuggested by this idea. I end by pointing out how the photon `structure' has\nimportant implications for the interactions of high energy photons and hence\nfor the design of the next generation of the high energy $e^+e^-$ (linear)\ncolliders which are absolutely essential for locating the missing links in our\nknowledge of fundamental particles and interactions among them.\n", "  Radiative corrections to ${\\rm e}^{+}{\\rm e}^{-}\\! \\rightarrow {\\rm\nW}^{+}{\\rm W}^{-}$ from Majorana neutrinos are studied in the context of the\nsee-saw mechanism. Focusing on the effects of the fourth generation neutrinos,\nwe calculate W-pair form factors, the differential cross sections and the\nforward-backward asymmetries for the polarized electrons at one-loop level. The\nbehaviour of the form factors at the threshold of Majorana particle pair\nproductions is found to differ from that of Dirac particle pair productions. In\nthe cross section for unpolarized electrons, the radiative corrections,\ndepending on the mass parameters of the see-saw mechanism, are found to be\n$\\sim 0.5\\%$ at the energy range of the LEP200 and the next generation linear\ncolliders.\n", "  Hadron structure and nuclear structure are discussed from the common ground\nof effective chiral Lagrangians modeling QCD at low energy. The topics treated\nare the chiral bag model in large $N_c$ QCD, its connection to heavy-baryon\nchiral perturbation theory (HB\\chpt),\\ the role of nonabelian Berry gauge\nconnections for baryon excitations and the application of HB\\chpt \\ to the\nthermal $n+p\\rightarrow d +\\gamma$ process and to the axial-charge transitions\nin heavy nuclei.\n", "  The divergent large-order behaviour of the perturbative series relevant for\nthe determination of $\\as$ from $\\tau$ decay is controlled by the leading\nultraviolet (UV) renormalon. Even in the absence of the first infrared (IR)\nrenormalon, an ambiguity of order $\\Lambda^2/m_\\tau^2$ is introduced. We make a\nquantitative study of the practical implications of this ambiguity. We discuss\nthe magnitude of UV renormalon corrections obtained in the large-$N_f$ limit,\nwhich, although unrealistic, is nevertheless interesting to some extent. We\nthen study a number of improved approximants for the perturbative series, based\non a change of variable in the Borel representation, such as to displace the\nleading UV renormalon singularity at a larger distance from the origin than the\nfirst IR renormalon. The spread of the resulting values of $\\as(m^2_\\tau)$\nobtained by different approximants, at different renormalization scales, is\nexhibited as a measure of the underlying ambiguities. Finally, on the basis of\nmathematical models, we discuss the prospects of an actual improvement, given\nthe signs and magnitudes of the computed coefficients, the size of\n$\\as(m^2_\\tau)$ and what is known of the asymptotic properties of the series.\nOur conclusion is that a realistic estimate of the theoretical error cannot go\nbelow $\\delta\\as(m^2_\\tau) \\sim \\pm 0.060$, or $\\delta\\as(m^2_{\\sss Z}) \\sim\n\\pm 0.006$.\n", "  It is shown that from the data of future solar neutrino experiments (SNO and\nSuper-Kamiokande), in which high-energy $^8\\mathrm{B}$ neutrinos will be\ndetected, it will be possible in a model independent way: 1) To reveal the\npresence of sterile neutrinos in the flux of solar neutrinos on the earth; 2)\nTo obtain the initial flux of $^8\\mathrm{B}$ $\\nu_e$'s; 3) To determine the\nprobability of $\\nu_e$'s to survive as a function of neutrino energy.\n", "  We review the present knowledge of the Standard Model that is relevant in\nformulating its possible short distance extensions. We present different\nscenarios in terms of the Higgs mass, the only unknown parameter of the model.\nWe concentrate on the many small numbers in the model and suggest generic\nmethods to reproduce these numbers in terms of scale ratios, applying see-saw\nlike ideas to the breaking of chiral symmetries.\n", "  The differences between the $N=0$ and $N=1$ standard models are emphasized in\nformulating their short distance extension. We sketch methods to reproduce many\nof the small numbers in the model in terms of scale ratios, applying see-saw\nlike ideas to the breaking of chiral symmetries. We sketch how the $N=1$\nstandard model, outfitted with an extra family Abelian symmetry to reproduce\nthe mass hierarchies, naturally fits superstring models, by making use of\ngeneric non-renormalizable operators.\n", "  In the minimal supersymmetric standard model, the three gauge couplings\nappear to unify at a mass scale near $2 \\times 10^{16}$ GeV. We investigate the\npossibility that intermediate scale particle thresholds modify the running\ncouplings so as to increase the unification scale. By requiring consistency of\nthis scenario, we derive some constraints on the particle content and locations\nof the intermediate thresholds. There are remarkably few acceptable solutions\nwith a single cleanly defined intermediate scale far below the unification\nscale.\n", "  In six chosen scenarios for the $q^2$ dependence of the form factors involved\nin $D_s^+ \\rightarrow \\phi $ transition, we have determined the allowed domain\nof $x = A_2(0) / A_1(0)$ and $y = V(0)/A_1(0)$ from the experimentally measured\nratios $R_{sl} = \\Gamma(D_s^+ \\rightarrow \\phi l^+ \\nu_l)/\\Gamma(D_s^+\n\\rightarrow \\phi \\pi^+)$ and $R_h = \\Gamma(D_s^+ \\rightarrow \\phi\n\\rho^+)/\\Gamma(D_s^+ \\rightarrow \\phi \\pi^+)$ in a scheme that uses the $N_c\n=3$ value of the phenomenological parameter $a_1$ and includes nonfactorized\ncontribution. We find that the experimentally measured values of $x$ and $y$\nfrom semileptonic decays of $D_s^+$ favor solutions which have significant\nnonfactorized contribution, and, in particular, $R_{sl}$ favors solutions in\nscenarios where $A_1(q^2)$ is either flat or decreasing with $q^2$.\n", "  GUT scale threshold corrections in minimal SU(5) supergravity grand\nunification are discussed. It is shown that predictions may be made despite\nuncertainties associated with the high energy scale. A bound relating the\nstrong coupling constant to the mass scales associated with proton decay and\nsupersymmetry is derived, and a sensitive probe of the underlying theory is\noutlined. In particular, low energy measurements can in principle determine the\npresence of Planck scale ($ 1 / {{\\rm M}_{\\rm Pl}} $) terms.\n", "  We consider a left-right symmetric model in which neutrinos acquire mass due\nto the spontaneous violation of both the gauged $B-L$ and a global $U(1)$\nsymmetry broken by the vacuum expectation value (VEV) of a gauge singlet scalar\nboson $\\VEV{\\sigma}$. For suitable choices of $\\VEV{\\sigma}$ consistent with\nall laboratory and astrophysical observations neutrinos will be unstable\nagainst majoron emission. All neutrino masses in the keV to MeV range are\npossible, since the expected neutrino decay lifetimes can be short enough to\ndilute their relic density below the cosmologically required level. A wide\nvariety of possible new phenomena, associated to the presence of left-right\nsymmetry and/or the global symmetry at the TeV scale, could therefore be\nobservable, without conflict with cosmology. The latter includes the\npossibility of invisibly decaying higgs bosons, which can be searched at LEP,\nNLC and LHC.\n", "  Technicolor, with extended technicolor, is the theory of dynamical\nelectroweak and flavor symmetry breaking at energies far below the Planck\nscale. To motivate it, I describe the most important difficulties of the\nstandard electroweak model of symmetry breaking by elementary scalar bosons. I\nthen tell how technicolor deals with these difficulties in a way that is both\ntechnically and physically natural. Finally, I discuss the problems of\ntechnicolor, both past and present. (This is the written version of an invited\ntalk given at the International Conference on the History of Original Ideas and\nBasic Discoveries in Particle Physics, Erice, Sicily, 29 July--4 August 1994.)\n", "  We study the possibility of canceling the cosmological constant in\nsupergravity string models. We show that with a suitable choice of\nsuperpotential the vacuum energy may vanish with the dilaton field at its\nminimum and supersymmetry broken with a large hierarchy. We derive the\ncondition for which the introduction of a chiral potential, e.g. the inflaton\npotential, does not destabilize the dilaton field even in the region where the\nscalar potential takes positive values. This allows for an inflationary\npotential with the dilaton frozen at its minimum.\n", "  Previous calculations of instanton effects in electroweak theory have\nconcentrated on the case of zero Weinberg angle $\\theta_w$, where the U(1)\nhypercharge field decouples. In this paper we extend the instanton calculation\nto non-zero $\\theta_w$, by constructing a perturbation expansion. This allows\nfor the first time the study of photon production at B and L number violating\nverticies. We find that the orientation of the instanton solution in isospin\nspace has to be carefully considered to avoid unphysical results.\n", "  The basics of a supersymmetric left-right model are reviewed. The production\nand subsequent decays of the doubly charged triplet higgsino $\n\\tilde\\Delta^{\\pm\\pm}$ in the Next Linear Collider are discussed. The slepton\npair production in the framework of this model is also analysed.\n", "  I examine the possibility that the electroweak interaction breaks itself via\nthe condensation of fermions in large representations of the weak SU(2)_L gauge\ngroup.\n", "  We show that the factorization assumption in color-suppressed $B$ meson\ndecays is not ruled out by experimental data on $B \\ra K(K^*) +\nJ/\\Psi(\\Psi^{'})$. The problem previously pointed out might be due to an\ninadequate choice of hadronic form factors. Within the Isgur-Wise SU(2) heavy\nflavor symmetry framework, we search for possible $q^2$ dependence of form\nfactors that are capable of explaining simultaneously the large longitudinal\npolarization $\\rho_L$ observed in $B \\ra K^* + J/\\Psi$ and the relatively small\nratio of rates $R_{J/\\Psi} = \\Gamma(B \\ra K^* + J/\\Psi)/\\Gamma(B \\ra K +\nJ/\\Psi)$. We find out that the puzzle could be essentially understood if the\n$A_1(q^2)$ form factor is frankly decreasing, instead of being almost constant\nor increasing as commonly assumed. Of course, the possibility of understanding\nexperimental data is not necessarily a proof of factorization.\n", "  We compute the supersymmetric contribution to\n  $R_{b}\\equiv \\Gamma (Z\\to b{\\bar b})/\\Gamma (Z\\to {\\rm hadrons})$ in a\nvariety of supergravity models. We find $R^{\\rm susy}_b\\lsim0.0004$, which does\nnot shift significantly the Standard Model prediction\n  ($R^{\\rm SM}_b=0.2162$ for $m_t=160\\GeV$). An improvement in experimental\nprecision by a factor of four would be required to be sensitive to such an\neffect.\n", "  The existence of hadronic molecular-type hybrids consisting of a baryon and a\nmeson is argued. Long-range interactions due to one-pion exchange is shown to\nbe strong enough to produce a loosely bound state. Specific features of a\nmolecular hybrid are discussed.\n", "  Because of the top quark's very large mass, about 175~GeV, it now provides\nthe best window into flavor physics. Thus, pair--production of top quarks at\nthe Tevatron Collider is the best probe of this physics until the Large Hadron\nCollider turns on in the next century. I discuss aspects of the mass and\nangular distributions that can be measured in $\\ttb$ production with the coming\nlarge data samples from the Tevatron and even larger ones from the LHC.\n", "  Present and future prospects for the discovery of new gauge bosons, $Z'$ and\n$W'$, are reviewed. Particular attention is paid to hadron and $e^+e^-$\ncollider searches for the $W'$ of the Left-Right Symmetric Model. (Presented at\nthe {\\it Fourth International Conference on Physics Beyond the Standard Model},\nLake Tahoe, CA, December 13-18, 1994.)\n", "  The Bethe-Salpeter (BS) equation for scalar-scalar bound states in scalar\ntheories without derivative coupling is formulated and solved in Minkowski\nspace. This is achieved using the perturbation theory integral representation\n(PTIR), which allows these amplitudes to be expressed as integrals over weight\nfunctions and known singularity structures and hence allows us to convert the\nBS equation into an integral equation involving weight functions. We obtain\nnumerical solutions using this formalism for a number of scattering kernels to\nillustrate the generality of the approach. It applies even when the na\\\"{\\i}ve\nWick rotation is invalid. As a check we verify, for example, that this method\napplied to the special case of the massive ladder exchange kernel reproduces\nthe same results as are obtained by Wick rotation.\n", "  We present some evidence, based on the analysis of lower-dimensional models,\nfor the possible existence of classically-stable winding solitons in the\ntwo-higgs electroweak theory.\n", "  The production of the Standard Model Higgs boson in the four-fermion reaction\n$e^+ e^- \\to \\mu^+ \\mu^- b \\bar b$ is studied. The complete tree-level matrix\nelement, including signal and backgrounds in the standard electroweak theory,\nis computed and initial state radiation is taken into account in the\nleading-log approximation. A Monte Carlo event generator has been built and\nnumerical results for some distributions of experimental interest for the\nsearch of the Higgs particle at future electron-positron colliders are shown,\ncompared with those existing in the literature and commented.\n", "  The physics case is summarised for the investigation of high energy spin\nphenomena by placing an internal polarised target into HERA's unpolarised\nproton beam. The luminosity and experimental sensitivity are discussed.\nEstimating the physics reach of single spin asymmetries in different final\nstates reveals a considerable physics potential in testing the spin sector of\nperturbative QCD.\n", "  Considering the observed anisotropy in cosmic microwave background radiation\n($\\Delta T/T \\leq 10^{-4}$) an upper limit on the electric charge asymmetry\nover a cosmological scale is found which is several orders more stringent than\nthose found earlier. The same argument constrains the charge of massless,\ndegenerate neutrinos.\n", "  We discuss the potential of a $0.5\\hskip 2pt TeV$ linear collider to explore\nmanifestations of extended (or alternative) electroweak models of current\ninterest, through measurements of the reaction $e^+e^-\\to W^+W^-$ with both\ninitial and final states polarization. Specifically, we consider the\npossibility to put stringent constraints on lepton mixing (or extended lepton\ncouplings) and $Z-Z^\\prime$ mixing, showing in particular the usefulness of\npolarization in order to disentangle these effects.\n", "  Forward-backward charge asymmetry in rare dilepton $B$-decays is formulated\nwith the assumption of an on-shell b-quark. We find the asymmetry is expressed\nin terms of two spatially transverse helicity amplitudes, which are determined\nby combining the data of $D\\rightarrow K^*(892)\\; l^+ \\nu$ with heavy flavour\nsymmetry. We estimate the charge asymmetry of $B\\rightarrow K^*(892)\\; l^+ l^-$\nfor large energy leptons against various top masses in the standard model.\n", "  We compute the full set of weak-scale gauge and Yukawa threshold corrections\nin the minimal supersymmetric standard model, including all finite\n(non-logarithmic) corrections, which we show to be important. We use our\nresults to examine the effects of unification-scale threshold corrections in\nthe minimal and missing-doublet SU(5) models. We work in the context of a\nunified mass spectrum, with scalar mass M_0 and gaugino mass M_1/2, and find\nthat in minimal SU(5) with squark masses less than one TeV, successful gauge\nand Yukawa coupling unification requires M_1/2 << M_0 and M_0 \\simeq 1 TeV. In\ncontrast, we find that the missing-doublet model permits gauge and Yukawa\nunification for a wide range of supersymmetric masses.\n", "  We construct effective Hamiltonians which despite their apparently\nnonrelativistic form incorporate relativistic effects by involving parameters\nwhich depend on the relevant momentum. For some potentials the corresponding\nenergy eigenvalues may be determined analytically. Applied to two-particle\nbound states, it turns out that in this way a nonrelativistic treatment may\nindeed be able to simulate relativistic effects. Within the framework of hadron\nspectroscopy, this lucky circumstance may be an explanation for the sometimes\nextremely good predictions of nonrelativistic potential models even in\nrelativistic regions.\n", "  We perform an exhaustive analysis of the Equivalence Theorem both in the\nminimal Standard Model and in an Effective Electroweak Chiral Lagrangian up to\n${\\cal O}(p^4)$. We have considered the leading corrections to the usual\nprescription consisting in just replacing longitudinally polarized $W$ or $Z$\nby the corresponding Goldstone bosons. The corrections appear through an\noverall constant multiplying the Goldstone boson amplitude as well as through\nadditional diagrams. By including them we can extend the domain of\napplicability of the Equivalence Theorem, making it suitable for precision\ntests of the symmetry breaking sector of the Standard Model. The on-shell\nscheme has been used throughout. When considering the Equivalence Theorem in an\nEffective Chiral lagrangian we analyze its domain of applicability, as well as\nseveral side issues concerning gauge fixing, Ward identities, on-shell scheme\nand matching conditions in the effective theory. We have analyzed in detail the\nprocesses $W^+ W^- \\to W^+W^-$ and $W^+W^+\\to W^+W^+$ to illustrate the points\nmade.\n", "  In three-dimensional QED with a Chern--Simons term we study the phase\nstructure associated with chiral-symmetry breaking in the framework of the\nSchwinger--Dyson equation. We give detailed analyses on the analytical and\nnumerical solutions for the Schwinger--Dyson equation of the fermion\npropagator, where the nonlocal gauge-fixing procedure is adopted to avoid\nwave-function renormalization for the fermion. In the absence of the\nChern--Simons term, there exists a finite critical number of four-component\nfermion flavors, at which a continuous (infinite-order) chiral phase transition\ntakes place and below which the chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken. In the\npresence of the Chern--Simons term, we find that the spontaneous\nchiral-symmetry-breaking transition continues to exist, but the type of phase\ntransition turns into a discontinuous first-order transition. A simple\nstability argument is given based on the effective potential, whose stationary\npoint gives the solution of the Schwinger-Dyson equation.\n", "  We calculate the next-to-leading QCD corrections to the effective Hamiltonian\nfor \\Bsee in the NDR and HV schemes. We give for the first time analytic\nexpressions for the Wilson Coefficient of the operator $Q_9 = (\\bar s\nb)_{V-A}(\\bar e e)_V$ in the NDR and HV schemes. Calculating the relevant\nmatrix elements of local operators in the spectator model we demonstrate the\nscheme independence of the resulting short distance contribution to the\nphysical amplitude. Keeping consistently only leading and next-to-leading\nterms, we find an analytic formula for the differential dilepton invariant mass\ndistribution in the spectator model. Numerical analysis of the $\\mt$, $\\Lms$\nand $\\mu \\approx {\\cal O}(\\mb)$ dependences of this formula is presented. We\ncompare our results with those given in the literature.\n", "  The spin-dependent structure function of the deuteron, g_1D, is calculated\nwithin a covariant framework. The off-shell structure of the bound nucleon\ngives corrections to the convolution model at a level of half a percent for x\nbelow 0.7, increasing to more than five percent at larger x. Overall, the\ndominant source of error comes from the lack of knowledge associated with the\ndeuteron D-state, which may introduce an uncertainty in the neutron spin\nstructure function, g_1n, extracted from deuterium data of up to ten percent\nfor x around 0.2.\n", "  We describe a method to remove non-decoupling heavy fields from a quantized\nfield theory and to construct a low-energy one-loop effective Lagrangian by\nintegrating out the heavy degrees of freedom in the path integral. We apply\nthis method to the Higgs boson in a spontaneously broken SU(2) gauge theory\n(gauged linear sigma-model). In this context, the background-field method is\ngeneralized to the non-linear representation of the Higgs sector by applying (a\ngeneralization of) the Stueckelberg formalism. The (background) gauge-invariant\nrenormalization is discussed. At one loop the log M_H-terms of the heavy-Higgs\nlimit of this model coincide with the UV-divergent terms of the corresponding\ngauged non-linear sigma-model, but vertex functions differ in addition by\nfinite (constant) terms in both models. These terms are also derived by our\nmethod. Diagrammatic calculations of some vertex functions are presented as\nconsistency check.\n", "  We reexamine radiative corrections to $\\pi_{l2}$ and $K_{l2}$ decays. We\nperform a matching calculation, including vector and axial vector resonances as\nexplicit degrees of freedom in the long distance part. By considering the\ndependence on the matching scale and on the hadronic parameters, and by\ncomparing with model independent estimates, we scrutinize the model dependence\nof the results. For the pseudoscalar meson decay constants, we extract the\nvalues f_pi = (92.1 \\pm 0.3) MeV and f_K = (112.4 \\pm 0.9) MeV. For the ratios\nR_pi and R_K of the electronic and muonic decay modes, we predict R_pi =\n(1.2354 \\pm 0.0002) 10^{-4} and R_K = (2.472 \\pm 0.001) 10^{-5}.\n", "  All the realistic free fermionic models utilize a set of basis vectors, the\nNAHE set, that correspond to $Z_2\\times Z_2$ orbifold compactification with\nnontrivial background fields. I argue that the realistic features of free\nfermionic models, like the number of generations and the fermion mass spectrum\nare due to the underlying $Z_2\\times Z_2$ orbifold compactification.\n", "  The accuracy of the conventional treatment of quark mass thresholds in the\nQCD running coupling constant $\\alpha_s$, based on the step approximation to\nthe $\\beta$--function, is investigated. The errors of extrapolating $\\ase(\\mu)$\nfrom low energies to $\\mu=M_Z$, implied by this approximation, are shown to be\nof the same magnitude as the typical next--to--next--to--leading order\ncontributions to \\as and tend to increase the resulting \\as. The importance of\nthe proper choice of matching points is emphasized.\n", "  The spectra of states containing charmed and beauty quarks, and their\nregularities, are reviewed.\n", "  We propose a new cosmological model with a time-dependent cosmological\nconstant ($\\Lambda\\propto 1/t^2$), which starting at the Planck time as\n$\\Lambda_{Pl}\\sim M^2_{Pl}$, evolves to the present-day allowed value of\n$\\Lambda_0\\sim10^{-120}M^2_{Pl}$. This scenario is supported by non-critical\nstring theory considerations. We compute the age of the Universe and the\ntime-dependence of the scale factor in this model, and find general agreement\nwith recent determinations of the Hubble parameter for substantial values of\n$\\Omega_{\\rm \\Lambda}$. This effectively low-density open Universe model\ndiffers from the traditional cosmological constant model, and has observable\nimplications for particle physics and cosmology.\n", "  The Schwinger-Dyson equation for the quark self-energy is solved for the case\nof the third and fourth quark generations. The exchanges of standard model\ngluons and Higgs bosons are taken into account. It is found that Higgs boson\nexchange dominates quark self-energy in the ultraviolet region for sufficiently\nlarge input quark masses, causing the running quark propagator mass to increase\nwith energy-scale. No running of the quark mixing angles is found for input\nquark masses up to and including 500 GeV.\n", "  Various issues surrounding a recently proposed inequality among twist-two\nquark distributions in the nucleon are discussed. We provide a rigorous\nderivation of the inequality in QCD, including radiative corrections and scale\ndependence. We also give a more heuristic, but more physical derivation, from\nwhich we show that a similar inequality does not exist among twist-three quark\ndistributions. We demonstrate that the inequality does not constrain the\nnucleon's tensor charge. Finally we explore physical mechanisms for saturating\nthe inequality, arguing it is unlikely to occur in Nature.\n", "  A complete supersymmetric SO(10) model is constructed, which is the most\ngeneral consistent with certain $R$, discrete, and $U(1)$ flavor symmetries.\nThe desired vacuum of the theory has vevs which lie in particular directions of\ngroup space. This leads to both doublet triplet splitting and to the generation\nof just four operators for charged fermion masses. The model illustrates how\nmany features of superunification become related in the context of a complete\ntheory. The features discussed here include: the weak mixing angle prediction,\nthe doublet-triplet splitting problem, proton decay, the generation of the\n$\\mu$ parameter, neutrino masses and the generation of the operators which lead\nto charged fermion mass predictions.\n", "  The complete matrix element for $e^+e^-\\ar b\\bar bZ^0Z^0$ has been computed\nat tree--level and applied to $Z^0H^0$--production followed by $Z^0\\ar b\\bar b$\nand $H^0\\ar Z^0Z^0$, including all the irreducible background, at Next Linear\nColliders. We find that, assuming flavour identification of the $Z^0$--decay\nproducts, this channel, together with $e^+e^-\\ar b\\bar bW^+W^-$ in which\n$Z^0H^0\\ar (b\\bar b)(W^+W^-$), can be important for the study of the parameters\nof the Standard Model Higgs boson over the heavy mass range $2M_{Z^0}\\Ord\nM_{H^0}\\Ord 2{m_t}$.\n", "  An electric monopole solution to the equations of Maxwell and Einstein's\ngeneral relativity is displayed. It differs from the usual one in that all\ncomponents of the metric vanish at large spatial distances from the charge\nrather than approaching the Minkowski metric. This enables us to find an\napproximate solution to that for many charges.\n", "  Earlier work reported on the existence of a term within a generalized\nskyrmion approach that yields appreciable spin content for the proton.\nUnfortunately there is no accessible experiment that can fix the coefficient of\nthis term directly; plausible but highly uncertain values for it gave a result\nfor the spin content loosely consistent with the currently measured\n$\\Delta\\Sigma = 0.27\\pm 0.13.$ We here attempt to narrow the range of values\nfor this coefficient by performing global fits to all the parameters of the\ngeneralized Skyrme lagrangian while requiring reasonable results for the baryon\noctet and decuplet masses and octet magnetic moments. This requirement fixes\nthe coefficient loosely, and we find that parameter sets that fit the baryon\nmasses and magnetic moments yield proton spin content near $\\Delta\\Sigma \\sim\n0.15.$\n", "  Corrections to hyperfine splitting and Lamb shift of order\n$\\alpha^2(Z\\alpha)^5$ induced by the diagrams with radiative photon insertions\nin the electron line are calculated in the Fried-Yennie gauge. These\ncontributions are as large as $-7.725(3)\\alpha^2(Z\\alpha)^5/(\\pi\nn^3)(m_r/m)^3m$ and $-0.6711(7)\\alpha^2(Z\\alpha)/(\\pi n^3)E_F$ for the Lamb\nshift and hyperfine splitting, respectively. Phenomenological implications of\nthese results are discussed with special emphasis on the accuracy of the\ntheoretical predictions for the Lamb shift and experimental determination of\nthe Rydberg constant. New more precise value of the Rydberg constant is\nobtained on the basis of the improved theory and experimental data.\n", "  The status of the Standard Model (SM) is reviewed. We emphazize the fact that\nin spite of the success of the SM for the descrition of the fermionic sector,\nthe status of the bosonic sector (gauge and scalar) suffers from many\ntheoretical deficiencies and from the lack of empirical support. This\nsituation, which leaves room for several types of extensions or alternatives to\nSM, strongly motivates the pursue of intense efforts for finding hints of New\nPhysics (NP) effects. We present a phenomenological description valid for\nenergies lying below the NP scale. We discuss the indirect constraints\nestablished from high precision tests at LEP1, as well as the direct tests that\ncould be performed at future machines\n", "  The available data on large scale structures seem to favour models with mixed\ndark matter (MDM), i.e. with a hot and cold component in a rather well--defined\namount, or with some form of ``warm\" dark matter. I discuss some prospects for\nthese new scenarios for DM in the context of supersymmetric extensions of the\nelectroweak standard model. In particular, I emphasize the intriguing link\nwhich exists between the present prospects of solution of the DM puzzle and the\nexplicit or spontaneous breaking of baryon and/or lepton number symmetries.\nSome consequences on the issue of baryogenesis are worked out.\n", "  We investigate the evolution of parton densities at small values of the\nmomentum fraction, x, by including resummed anomalous dimensions in the\nrenormalization group equations. The resummation takes into account the\nleading-logarithmic contributions (\\alpha_S \\ln x)^k given by the BFKL equation\nand the next-to-leading-logarithmic corrections from quark evolution. We\npresent numerical results for the parton densities and the deep inelastic\nstructure function F_2.\n", "  Talks presented at Beyond The Standard Model IV Conference, Lake Tahoe, Dec\n94:\n  NEW FERMION FAMILIES AND PRECISION ELECTROWEAK DATA: We highlight a trend in\nthe precision electroweak data towards light new physics and argue that some\nspectra of strongly interacting technifamilies are plausibly compatible with\nthe data.\n  FERMION MASSES IN EXTENDED TECHNICOLOUR: An ETC model with a minimal number\nof operators responsible for fermion masses that break the global symmetries in\nthe observed manner postdicts the light quark masses. The up down mass\ninversion may be explained by the inclusion of a family symmetric ansatz for\nthe CKM matrix angles.\n", "  The value of the proton singlet axial constant is estimated. It has been\nshown that the axial anomaly plays a crucial role in this calculation. Obtained\nresult is sufficiently suppressed in comparison with the naively expected one.\nThe magnitude of the strange quark contribution for the proton state is also\ncomputed approximately.\n", "  We outline a general method for obtaining the solution to the ($t=0$) BFKL\nequation in the presence of transverse momentum cutoffs. A lower cutoff allows\none to avoid integration over nonperturbative momenta and an upper one is\nneeded from energy-momentum conservation. Our method allows for the inclusion\nof an arbitrary number of poles in the kernel and is applicable to any input\ndistribution. Taking Mellin transforms, we discuss the effect of introducing\ncutoffs by considering the singularity structure in the transform space. We\npresent an improved calculation of the small-$x$ slope of the gluon density.\n", "  We estimate the amplitude of thermal fluctuations by calculating the typical\nsize of subcritical bubbles in cosmological electroweak phase transition and\nshow that this thermal fluctuation effect drastically changes dynamics of the\nphase transition from the ordinary first order type with supercooling. From\nthis fact, we conclude that the standard electroweak baryogenesis scenario\nassociated with such a first order transition does not work in the minimal\nstandard model in certain conditions.\n", "  Nuclear modification of the structure function $F_3$ is investigated.\nAlthough it could be estimated in the medium and large $x$ regions from the\nnuclear structure function $F_2^A$, it is essentially unknown at small $x$. The\nnuclear structure function $F_3^A$ at small $x$ is investigated in two\ndifferent theoretical models: a parton-recombination model with $Q^2$ rescaling\nand an aligned-jet model. We find that these models predict completely\ndifferent behavior at small $x$: {\\it antishadowing} in the first parton model\nand {\\it shadowing} in the aligned-jet model. Therefore, studies of the ratio\n$F_3^A/F_3^D$ at small $x$ could be useful in discriminating among different\nmodels, which produce similar shadowing behavior in the structure function\n$F_2$. We also estimate currently acceptable nuclear modification of $F_3$ at\nsmall $x$ by using $F_2^A/F_2^D$ experimental data and baryon-number\nconservation.\n", "  We study one loop electroweak corrections to the production of a pair of\ncharged Higgs bosons through an intermediate $Z$-boson or photon. In\nparticular, we consider the effects of graphs with top and bottom quarks and\nsquarks in the loop within the context of the Minimal Supersymmetric Model. We\nfind that the corrections can be considerable, and typically are of the order\nof 10\\% to 20\\%.\n", "  In models with a non-minimal Higgs sector, a decoupling limit can be defined.\nIn this limit, the masses of all the physical Higgs states are large (compared\nto the scale of electroweak symmetry breaking) except for one neutral CP-even\nHiggs scalar, whose properties are indistinguishable from the Higgs boson of\nthe minimal Standard Model. The decoupling limit of the most general\nCP-conserving two-Higgs doublet model is formulated. Detection of evidence for\na non-minimal Higgs sector at future colliders in the decoupling limit may\npresent a formidable challenge for future Higgs searches.\n", "  We consider the low energy phenomenology of superstrings. In particular we\nanalyse supersymmetry breaking via gaugino condensate and we compare the\nphenomenology of the two different approaches to stabilize the dilaton field.\nWe study the cosmological constant problem and we show that it is possible to\nhave supersymmetry broken and zero cosmological constant. Finally, we discuss\nthe possibility of having an inflationary potential. Requiring that the\npotential does not destabilize the dilaton field imposes an upper limit to the\ndensity fluctuations which can be consistent with the COBE data.\n", "  We use the method of finite temperature field theory to examine the\npropagation of mixed neutrinos through dense media, putting the emphasis in\nthose situations in which the neutrinos themselves are in the background. The\nevolution equation for the flavor amplitudes is deduced, and the expressions\nfor the corresponding hamiltonian matrix are given explicitly. We find that, in\norder to include the nonlinear effects due to the $\\nu$-$\\nu$ interactions, the\nneutrino propagator that must be used in the calculation of the neutrino\nself-energy diagrams that contain neutrinos in the internal lines is the\npropagator for the neutrino modes in the medium instead of the thermal\nfree-field propagator. We also show how the absorptive contributions are\nincluded in terms of a non-hermitian part of the hamiltonian matrix, which we\nindicate how it is calculated. Our treatment provides a consistent\ngeneralization of a method that has been successfully applied to the study of\nneutrino oscillations in matter.\n", "  Working group II at WHEPP3 concentrated on issues related to the\nsupersymmetric standard model as well as SUSY GUTS and neutrino properties. The\nprojects identified by various working groups as well as progress made in them\nsince WHEPP3 are briefly reviewed.\n", "  The $\\rho\\omega$--mixing generated by the isospin breaking of the current\nquark masses $m_{u} \\neq m_{d}$ is studied within the bosonized NJL model in\nthe gradient expansion. The resulting effective meson lagrangian naturally\nincorperates vector meson dominance. By including pion loops an excellent\ndescription of both the pion electromagnetic form factor and of the\n$\\pi^+\\pi^-$ phase shifts in the vector--isovector channel is obtained. The\n$\\rho\\omega$--mixing can be treated in the static approximation but is\nabsolutely necessary to reproduce the fine structure of the electromagnetic\nform factor, while the pion loops are necessary to obtain the correct energy\ndependence of the phase shifts.\n", "  The gluon propagator is calculated in the instanton background in a form\nappropriate for extracting the momentum dependent gluon mass. In\nbackground-$\\xi$-gauge we get for the mass $400$MeV for small $p^2$ independent\nof the gauge parameter $\\xi$.\n", "  The doublet-triplet splitting problem is perhaps the most problematic aspect\nof supersymmetric grand unified theories. It can be argued that the most\nnatural reason for the Higgs doublets to be light is that they are\npseudo-Goldstone bosons associated with the spontaneous breakdown of an\naccidental global symmetry. In this paper we discuss the possibility of\nimplementing this idea in the SU(6) model of refs. \\cite{Zur,Bar2,Bar3,Bar4}.\nWe show that although it is simple to generate an accidental symmetry of the\nrenormalizable terms of the potential, it is quite difficult to construct a\nmodel which allows for the preservation of the accidental symmetry in the\nnonrenormalizable terms. We summarize the constraints on such models and then\ngive three different ways to construct a superpotential where the dangerous\nmixing terms are sufficiently suppressed even in the presence of\nnonrenormalizable operators. With these examples we demonstrate the existence\nof consistent models implementing the Higgs as pseudo-Goldstone boson scheme.\nWe extend one of the three examples to include fermion masses. We also show\nthat when restricted to regular group embeddings the only possible models\nwithout light triplets are trivial generalizations of the SU(6) model we\nconsider.\n", "  The cross section for producing $WZ$ pairs at hadron colliders is calculated\nto order $\\alpha_s$ for general $C$ and $P$ conserving $WWZ$ couplings. The\neffects of the next-to-leading-order corrections on the derived sensitivity\nlimits for anomalous $WWZ$ couplings are discussed. The prospects for observing\nthe approximate amplitude zero, which is present in the standard model $WZ$\nhelicity amplitudes, are also discussed.\n", "  By relating fine and hyperfine spittings for l=1 states in bottomium we can\nfactor out the less tractable part of the perturbative and nonperturbative\neffects. Reliable predictions for one of the fine splittings and the hyperfine\nsplitting can then be made calculating in terms of the remaining fine\nsplitting, which is then taken from experiment; perturbative and\nnonperturbative corrections to these relations are under full control. The\nmethod (which produces reasonable results even for the $c{\\bar c}$ system)\npredicts a value of 1.5 MeV for the $(s=1)-(s=0)$ splitting in $b{\\bar b}$,\nopposite in sign to that in $c{\\bar c}$. For this result the contribution of\nthe gluon condensate $<\\alpha_s G^2>$ is essential, as any model (in particular\npotential models) which neglects this would give a negative $b{\\bar b}$\nhyperfine splitting.\n", "  Some implications of the proposal that flavor nondiagonal couplings of\nneutrinos to gravity might resolve the solar neutrino problem are considered in\nthe context of three neutrino flavours. Using an adiabatic approximation\niso-SNU curves are calculated for the neutrinos which most likely contribute to\nthe observed solar neutrino deficiency. We show that results obtained with\ntwo-flavor models can be recovered, and discuss the effects of the addition of\na third flavor. Some results are obtained for this case, and these values are\ncompared with recent experimental data.\n", "  Spontaneous breaking of CPT is possible in string theory. We show that it can\narise at a level within reach of experiments at meson factories currently being\nbuilt or designed. For $\\phi$, $B$, and $\\tau$-charm factories, we discuss the\nlikely experimental string signatures and provide estimates of the bounds that\nmight be attained in these machines.\n", "  By using a non-perturbative expansion and the dispersion relation for the\nAdler $D$--function we propose a new method for constructing the QCD effective\ncoupling constant in the timelike region.\n", "  The recent F$_2$ measurements at HERA are discussed in the framework of\nvirtual photon--proton cross section. The energy behaviour of the cross section\nis studied for different $Q^2$ values, ranging from 0 to 1000 GeV$^2$ for\ncenter of mass energies $1.75 < W < 300$ GeV.\n", "  The phenomenon of scaling in deep inelastic lepton-nucleon scattering is\nusually explained in terms of the Feynman parton model, and the logarithmic\ncorrections to scaling are explained in the framework of perturbative QCD. For\ntesting the validity of the parton model, we consider the deep inelastic\nelectron scattering in a model in which the system electromagnetic current\noperator explicitly satisfies relativistic invariance and current conservation.\nLet the struck particle have the fraction $\\xi$ of the total momentum in the\ninfinite momentum frame. Then it is shown that, due to binding of particles in\nthe system under consideration, the Bjorken variable $x$ no longer can be\ninterpreted as $\\xi$, even in the Bjorken limit and in zero order of the\nperturbation theory. We argue that, as a result, the data on deep inelastic\nscattering alone do not make it possible to determine the $\\xi$ distribution of\nquarks in the nucleon.\n", "  This paper is based on four lectures given at the Trieste Summer School 1994\non theories of fermion masses. The first two lectures introduce three\nmechanisms which have been used to construct models of fermion masses. We then\ndiscuss some recent applications of these ideas. In the last lecture we briefly\nreview SO(10) and some predictive theories of fermion masses.\n", "  We propose an effective mass matrix for light neutrinos which is consistent\nwith the mixing pattern indicated by solar and atmospheric neutrino\nexperiments. Two scenarios for the mass eigenvalues are discussed and the\nconnection with double beta decay is noted.\n", "  We discuss some flavour-changing effective Lagrangians, obtained from scales\nabove 1 GeV, which vanish on the quark mass shell. Although the effects of such\neffective Lagrangians are zero in the limit of vanishing bound-state\ninteractions, we have shown that they have a significant impact on the\nprocesses $K\\rightarrow\\gamma\\gamma$ and $B_s \\rightarrow\\gamma\\gamma$.\n", "  In this talk I summarize published work on a systematic operator analysis for\nfermion masses in a class of effective supersymmetric SO(10)\nGUTs\\cite{adhrs}~\\footnote{This work is in collaboration with G. Anderson, S.\nDimopoulos, L.J. Hall, and G. Starkman.}. Given a minimal set of four operators\nat $M_G$, we have just 6 parameters in the fermion mass matrices. We thus make\n8 predictions for the 14 low energy observables (9 quark and charged lepton\nmasses, 4 quark mixing angles and $\\tan \\beta$). Several models, i.e.\nparticular sets of dominant operators, are in quantitative agreement with the\nlow energy data. In the second half of the talk I discuss the necessary\ningredients for an SO(10) GUT valid below the Planck (or string) scale which\nreproduces one of our models. \\footnote{These are preliminary results of work\nin progress with Lawrence Hall.} This complete GUT should still be interpreted\nas an effective field theory, i.e. perhaps the low energy limit of a string\ntheory.\n", "  Invited talk presented at the 1994 Meeting of The Division of Particles and\nFields of the American Physical Society, Albuquerque NM, August 1-6, 1994\n", "  We establish the most general parametrization of the new physics tested by\npresent precision measurements and possibly responsible for any deviation of\nthe $Z\\to b \\bar b $ amplitude from its Standard Model result, under the\nassumption that it is CP symmetric and is induced by degrees of freedom which\nare too heavy to be ~directly produced at the future Colliders. This is\nachieved by writing the complete list of the $SU(3)_c\\times SU(2) \\times U(1) $\ngauge invariant and CP symmetric $dim=6$ operators, involving only quarks of\nthe third family and/or bosons. The quark ~containing operators are divided\ninto two classes, according to whether they involve the $t_R$ field or not.\nEach class contains 14 quark operators. We then proceed to derive the\nconstraints from present precision measurements, on the first class of the 14\n$t_R$ involving operators. We show that the $Zb \\bar b$ vertex plays a\nfundamental role to discriminate not only between these operators, but also\nbetween this whole scheme and an alternative one like \\eg\\@ an MSSM description\nwith light chargino and neutral Higgs.\n", "  The properties of $\\rho$-mesons at finite temperature ($T$) are examined with\nan effective chiral lagrangian in which vector and axial-vector mesons are\nincluded as massive Yang-Mills fields of the chiral symmetry. It is shown that,\nat $T^2$ order, the effective mass is not changed but only the mixing effect in\nvector and axial-vector correlator appears.\n", "  We calculate the flux of cosmic gamma rays expected {}from the annihilation\nof neutralinos in the Galactic halo. Our calculation of the annihilation cross\nsection to two photons improves the existing calculations by inclusion of exact\none-loop diagrams for the amplitudes involving Higgs boson and chargino states\nas well as those involving fermion and sfermion states. A survey of\nsupersymmetric parameter space shows that numerous models would be observable\nat the $3\\sigma$ level with an air Cerenkov telescope with an exposure of $10^4\n\\meter^2 \\yr$.\n", "  The current theoretical understanding of disoriented chiral condensate is\nbriefly reviewed. I discuss the basic idea, the formation mechanism and\nexperimental signatures of DCC in high energy collisions.\n", "  We discuss the spin-dependent structure function $g_2(x,Q^2)$ in the\nframework of the operator product expansion. It is noted that the anomalous\ndimensions and coefficient functions for the twist-3 gluon-field-dependent\noperators depend on the choice of the operator basis. The role played by the\noperators proportional to the equation of motion is clarified.\n", "  We discuss the possible target mass corrections in the QCD analysis of\nnucleon's spin-dependent structure functions measured in the polarized\ndeep-inelastic leptoproduction. The target mass correction for the QCD Bjorken\nsum rule is obtained from the Nachtmann moment and its magnitude is estimated\nemploying positivity bound as well as the experimental data for the asymmetry\nparameters. We also study the uncertainty due to target mass effects in\ndetermining the QCD effective coupling constant $\\alpha_s(Q^2)$ from the\nBjorken sum rule. The target mass effect for the Ellis-Jaffe sum rule is also\nbriefly discussed.\n", "  The issue of testing CPT invariance at a $B$ factory is considered. We\npresent asymmetries that permit a clean extraction of quantities parametrizing\ndirect and indirect CPT violation, using information from $\\Upsilon(4S)$ decay\nvia coherent $B_d\\overline{B_d}$ pairs into various final states. Estimates are\ngiven of the bounds on CPT violation that could be obtained in present and\nplanned machines.\n", "  An effective field theory approach is developed for calculating the\nthermodynamic properties of a field theory at high temperature $T$ and weak\ncoupling $g$. The effective theory is the 3-dimensional field theory obtained\nby dimensional reduction to the bosonic zero-frequency modes. The parameters of\nthe effective theory can be calculated as perturbation series in the running\ncoupling constant $g^2(T)$. The free energy is separated into the contributions\nfrom the momentum scales $T$ and $gT$, respectively. The first term can be\nwritten as a perturbation series in $g^2(T)$. If all forces are screened at the\nscale $gT$, the second term can be calculated as a perturbation series in\n$g(T)$ beginning at order $g^3$. The parameters of the effective theory satisfy\nrenormalization group equations that can be used to sum up leading logarithms\nof $T/(gT)$. We apply this method to a massless scalar field with a $\\Phi^4$\ninteraction, calculating the free energy to order $g^6 \\log g$ and the\nscreening mass to order $g^5 \\log g$.\n", "  The diffractive process $\\gamma p\\to V + X$ (where $V$ is a vector meson and\n$X$ results from the dissociation of the proton) is studied. In particular, we\nconsider the region of large momentum transfer (i.e. $|t|\\gg\\Lambda_{QCD}^2$)\nand large centre-of-mass (CM) energy, $s$. The asymptotic $(s \\to \\infty,\ns/|t|\\gg 1$) behaviour is derived from the BFKL equation and compared to that\nwhich is obtained in the Born approximation (two-gluon exchange). We also\ncalculate the corrections to the Born graphs by iterating the BFKL kernel\nnumerically. Improved convergence of the BFKL series is found by summing the\nlogarithms which occur when an exchanged gluon goes nearly on shell.\nImportantly, we find evidence that the asymptotic solution to the BFKL equation\nis inappropriate over most of the HERA range and we provide more realistic\npredictions for the cross section. The predicted cross section is not too small\nand can be measured at HERA, up to momentum transfers $|t| \\sim 10$GeV$^2$.\n", "  We examine for representative gaugino-higgsino mixing scenarios\nslepton-neutralino and slepton-chargino production in deep inelastic\nep-scattering at $\\sqrt{s}=1.8$ TeV. We find sneutrino-chargino production to\nbe the dominant process with cross sections more than one order of magnitude\nbigger than those for slepton-squark production. Also for associated production\nof sneutrinos and zino-like neutralinos the cross sections are at least\ncomparable to those for $\\tilde l \\tilde q$-production, whereas\nselectron-neutralino/chargino production is with cross sections significantly\nsmaller than those for selectron-squark production less favorable. Typical\nsignatures include events with up to four charged leptons, hadronic jets and,\nin some cases, gauge bosons.\n", "  We compute the full set of weak-scale gauge and Yukawa threshold corrections\nin the minimal supersymmetric standard model, and use them to study the effects\nof the supersymmetric particle spectrum on gauge and Yukawa coupling\nunification.\n", "  We point out that the ratio of $W^+ W^- \\to W^+ W^-$ and $W^+W^- \\to ZZ$\ncross sections is a sensitive probe of the dynamics of electroweak symmetry\nbreaking, in the CM energy region $\\sqrt {s_{\\rm ww}^{}} \\agt 1$~TeV where\nvector boson scattering may well become strong. We suggest ways in which this\nratio can be extracted at a 1.5 TeV $e^+e^-$ linear collider, using $W^\\pm,Z\n\\to jj$ hadronic decays and relying on dijet mass resolution to provide\nstatistical discrimination between $W^\\pm$ and $Z$. $WW$ fusion processes\nstudied here are unique for exploring scalar resonances of mass about 1 TeV and\nare complementary to studies via the direct channel $e^+ e^- \\rightarrow\nW^+W^-$ for the vector and non-resonant cases. With an integrated luminosity of\n200 fb$^{-1}$, the signals obtained are statistically significant. Comparison\nwith a study of $e^-e^- \\rightarrow \\nu\\nu W^-W^-$ process is made.\nEnhancements of the signal rate from using a polarized electron beam, or at a 2\nTeV $e^+e^-$ linear collider and possible higher energy $\\mu^+\\mu^-$ colliders,\nare also presented.\n", "  We review the basic aspects of the perturbative QCD based on the operator\nproduct expansion to analyze the nucleon structure functions in a pedagogical\nway. We explain the non-trivial relation between the QCD results and the parton\nmodel especially to understand the polarized nucleon structure functions which\ndeserve much attentions in recent years.\n", "  We study the pseudoscalar, vector and axial current correlation functions in\nSU(2)-NJL model with scalar and vector couplings. The correlation functions are\nevaluated in leading order in number of colors $N_c$. As it is expected in the\npseudoscalar channel pions appear as Goldstone bosons, and after fixing the\ncutoff to reproduce the physical pion decay constant, we obtain well-known\ncurrent-algebra results. For the vector and axial channels we use essentially\nthat at spacelike momenta the correlation functions can be related to the\nexperimentally known spectral density via dispersion relations. We show that\nthe latter imposes strong bounds on the strength of the vector coupling in the\nmodel. We find that the commonly used on-shell treatment of the vector and\naxial mesons (identified as poles at large timelike momenta) fails to reproduce\nthe behavior of the corresponding correlation functions at small spacelike\nmomenta extracted from the physical spectral density. The parameters of the NJL\nmodel fixed by the correlation functions at small spacelike momenta differ\nnoticeably from those of the on-shell treatment.\n", "  According to the Coleman-Glashow null theorem if all the symmetry breaking\neffects belong to the same regular representation (octet in the case of SU(3)\nand {\\bf 15} in the case of SU(4)) and are generated in a tadpole type\nmechanism, the strangeness changing (charm changing) weak transitions generated\nthrough the S$_{6}$ (S$_{9}$) tadpole must vanish. Exploiting this null result,\nwe find relations between the BBP coupling constants which allow us to write\nthe coupling constants in terms of two parameters and baryon masses. Fixing\nthese two parameters ( $g_{NN\\pi}$ and $g_{\\Lambda \\Sigma \\pi}$) from\nexperiments, we estimate the remaining coupling constants.\n", "  A relativistic hadronic model for nuclear matter and finite nuclei, which\nincorporates nonlinear chiral symmetry and broken scale invariance, is\npresented and applied at the one-baryon-loop level to finite nuclei. The model\ncontains an effective light scalar field that is responsible for the mid-range\nnucleon--nucleon attraction and which has anomalous scaling behavior. One-loop\nvacuum contributions in this background scalar field at finite density are\nconstrained by low-energy theorems that reflect the broken scale invariance of\nquantum chromodynamics. A mean-field energy functional for nuclear matter and\nnuclei is derived that contains small powers of the fields and their\nderivatives, and the validity of this truncation is discussed. Good fits to the\nbulk properties of finite nuclei and single-particle spectra are obtained.\n", "  The discovery of a new neutral gauge boson $Z'$ with a mass in the TeV region\nwould allow for determination of gauge couplings of the $Z'$ to ordinary quarks\nand leptons in a model independent way. We show that these couplings in turn\nwould allow us to determine the nature of the extended gauge structure. As a\nprime example we study the $E_6$ group. In this case two discrete constraints\non experimentally determined couplings have to be satisfied. If so, the\ncouplings would then uniquely determine the two parameters, $\\tan \\beta$ and\n$\\delta$, which fully specify the nature of the $Z'$ within $E_6$. If the $Z'$\nis part of the $E_6$ gauge structure, then for $M_{Z'}=1$ TeV $\\tan \\beta$ and\n$\\delta$ could be determined to around $10\\%$ at the future colliders. The NLC\nprovides a unique determination of the two constraints as well as of $\\tan\n\\beta$ and $\\delta$, though with slightly larger error bars than at the LHC. On\nthe other hand, since the LHC primarily determines three out of four normalized\ncouplings, it provides weaker constraints for the underlying gauge structure.\n", "  We evaluate the two-loop ${\\cal O}(\\alpha_sG_Fm_t^2)$ correction to the $ZZH$\ncoupling in the Standard Model by means of a low-energy theorem, assuming that\nthe top quark is much heavier than the Higgs boson. We then construct a\nheavy-top-quark effective Lagrangian for the $ZZH$ interaction that\naccommodates the ${\\cal O}(G_Fm_t^2)$ and ${\\cal O}(\\alpha_sG_Fm_t^2)$\ncorrections and derive from it the corresponding corrections to the $H\\to ZZ$\ndecay as well as those to Higgs-boson production at LEP1, via $Z\\to f\\bar fH$,\nand at LEP2, via $e^+e^-\\to ZH$. In all cases, the leading ${\\cal O}(G_Fm_t^2)$\nterms are considerably screened by their QCD corrections, if the on-shell\nrenormalization scheme with $G_F$ as a basic parameter is employed.\n", "  The phenomenological consequences of the dilaton-type soft supersymmetry\nbreaking terms in the context of the next to minimal supersymmetric standard\nmodel are investigated. We always find a very low top quark mass. As a\nconsequence such string vacua are excluded by recent experimental results. The\nviability of the solution of the $\\mu$ term through the introduction of a gauge\nsinglet field is also briefly discussed.\n", "  An inflationary scenario that leads to $\\Omega _0<1$ today is presented. An\nepoch of `old' inflation during which the smoothness and horizon problems are\nsolved is followed by a shortened epoch of `new' inflation. Old inflation exits\nthrough the nucleation of a single bubble, leading to negative spatial\ncurvature on slices of constant cosmic time. We calculate the spectrum of\ndensity perturbations in such a scenario.\n", "  When addressing the thermodynamics of finite-sized systems, one must specify\nwhether one wants to fix conserved charges to a sharp value or whether one is\ncontent to fix their thermodynamic average. In other words, contrary to the\nthermodynamic limit, different statistical ensembles are not equivalent. When\ntreating the plasma phases of gauge field theories perturbatively in the\ncanonical ensemble, unexpected new difficulties arise in comparison with the\nusual grand canonical treatment. The purpose of this paper is to expose these\ndifficulties and show how they can be remedied, thus recovering a well-defined\ndescription of plasmas even in a finite-size, canonical ensemble setting. For\ndefiniteness, a specific model is considered, namely QCD$_{1+1} $ with SU(2)\ncolor; however, the treatment presented should be applicable also to\nhigher-dimensional systems with different types of Coulomb interaction.\n", "  Within the skyrmion approach for the nucleon-nucleon force, difficulties have\nbeen experienced in obtaining an isoscalar attractive spin-orbit potential, in\nparallel to the problems of finding attraction in the isoscalar central\npotential. We here study the spin-orbit force using a skyrmion with four- and\nsix-derivative stabilizing terms in the lagrangian as well as with the crucial\naddition of a dilaton. With these features present the spin-orbit force proves\nto be attractive as does the central potential. In the absence of the dilaton,\nattraction can also be found for the spin-orbit potential but only at the\nexpense of a greatly over-emphasized term with six derivatives and a continuing\nabsence of attraction in the central potential.\n", "  I discuss recent work done with Gerry Brown on chiral phase transition at\nhigh temperature and/or density described in terms of Georgi's vector limit.\nThe notion of ``mended symmetry\" is suggested to play an important role in\nunderstanding the properties of hadrons in dense and/or hot matter before\nreaching the phase transition. It is shown that while the QCD vacuum in\nbaryon-free space is resistant to ``melting\" up to the critical temperature,\nbaryon-rich medium can induce the vacuum to become softer in temperature: the\nhadron masses drop faster in temperature when baryon matter is present.\n", "  We present results from analytical and numerical studies of a flux tube model\nof hybrid mesons. Our numerical results use a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm\nand so improve on previous analytical treatments, which assumed small flux tube\noscillations and an adiabatic separation of quark and flux tube motion. We find\nthat the small oscillation approximation is inappropriate for typical hadrons\nand that the hybrid mass is underestimated by the adiabatic approximation. For\nphysical parameters in the ``one-bead\" flux tube model we estimate the lightest\nhybrid masses (${}_\\Lambda L = {}_1 P$ states) to be 1.8-1.9~GeV for $u\\bar u$\nhybrids, 2.1-2.2~GeV for $s\\bar s$ and 4.1-4.2~GeV for $c\\bar c$. We also\ndetermine masses of conventional $q\\bar q$ mesons with $L=0$ to $L=3$ in this\nmodel, and confirm good agreement with experimental $J$-averaged multiplet\nmasses. Mass estimates are also given for hybrids with higher orbital and\nflux-tube excitations. The gap from the lightest hybrid level (${}_1P$) to the\nfirst hybrid orbital excitation (${}_1D$) is predicted to be $\\approx 0.4$~GeV\nfor light quarks $(q=u,d)$ and $\\approx 0.3$~GeV for $q=c$. Both ${}_1P$ and\n${}_1D$ hybrid multiplets contain the exotics $1^{-+}$ and $2^{+-}$; in\naddition the ${}_1P$ has a $0^{+-}$ and the ${}_1D$ contains a $3^{-+}$. Hybrid\nmesons with doubly-excited flux tubes are also considered. The implications of\nour results for spectroscopy are discussed, with emphasis on charmonium\nhybrids, which may be accessible at facilities such as BEPC, KEK, a Tau-Charm\nFactory, and in $\\psi$ production at hadron colliders.\n", "  The bound state problem for a fermion-antifermion system is considered taking\ninto account a finite decay width of the constituents. We propose an exactly\nsolvable relativistic zero order equation similar to that of Barbieri and\nRemiddi, but including a constant width. We focus especially on the $t\\bar{t}$\nsystem for which we reconsider our recent calculation of the bound state\ncorrections to the toponium width, which was performed in the narrow width\napproximation and needed the use of second order Bethe-Salpeter perturbation\ntheory. We show that one obtains the same result already in first order BS\nperturbation theory if one uses our present approach. Furthermore the large\ncancellations of gauge dependent terms is demonstrated to be a consequence of a\nWard identity. This cancellation mechanism is shown to be valid for general\nfermion-antifermion systems.\n", "  We examine the lepton-flavor violation caused by a Yukawa coupling matrix\n$y_{\\nu,ij}$ for right-handed neutrinos in the supersymmetric standard model.\nWe stress that decay rates for $\\tau\\rightarrow\\mu\\gamma$ and $\\mu\\rightarrow\ne\\gamma$ may reach the range to be accessible to near future experiments if\nleft-right mixing terms in the slepton mass matrix are substantially large.\n", "  Being inspired by a phenomenological success of a charged lepton mass\nformula, a model with U(3)-family nonet Higgs bosons is proposed. Here, the\nHiggs bosons $\\phi_L$ ($\\phi_R$) couple only between light fermions (quarks and\nleptons) $f_L$ ($f_R$) and super-heavy vector-like fermions $F_R$ ($F_L$), so\nthat the model leads to a seesaw-type mass matrix $M_f\\simeq m_L M_F^{-1} m_R$\nfor quarks and leptons $f=u,d,\\nu$ and $e$. Lower bounds of the physical Higgs\nboson masses are deduced from the present experimental data and possible new\nphysics from the present scenario is speculated.\n", "  We investigate a spectrum of the low-energy composite particles with the\nquantum numbers $J^p=0^\\pm,\\frac {1}{2}^\\pm$ in a $SU_{F}(3)$ model of hadron\nsupersymmetry. We derive the mass spectrum of two, three and four-quark states\nand determine all free parameters of a theory, including the masses of quarks\nand diquarks.\n", "  The chiral Abelian Higgs model is studied at finite temperature. By\nintegrating out the heavy modes, we make a three-dimensional effective theory\nfor the static modes. It is demonstrated that the plasma masses are correctly\nreproduced to leading order in $m^{2}/T^{2}$. The effective potential for the\ncomposite operator $\\phi^{\\dagger}\\phi$ is calculated at one loop for the\nresulting three-dimensional theory and it is shown that the result is gauge\nparameter invariant. The numerical investigation of the potential reveals that\nthe symmetry is restored via a first order phase transition. Comparison with\nthe ordinary ring improved potential is made and it is found that the barrier\nheight at $T_{c}$ is somewhat higher.\n", "  The final states for the process $b \\rightarrow s\\ \\gamma$ have been\nextensively discussed in the literature. Similarly-detailed analyses for the\ncase $b \\rightarrow s\\ gluon$ have not been performed. Generally this process\nis searched for in 2-body decays such as ${\\rm B}^0 \\rightarrow {\\rm K}^+\n\\pi^-$. We present simple arguments to suggest that most of the time the\nquark-level process will give rise to final states with rather high\nmultiplicities. Comments are made about the applicability of these results to\n$b \\rightarrow d\\ gluon$ and hadronic $b\\rightarrow u$ decays.\n", "  A method is presented to extract the tau neutrino helicity, or equivalently,\nthe chirality parameter $\\gamma_{\\mathrm{VA}}$, independent of any tau\npolarization which may be present. The method is thus well-suited to\nmeasurements using taus produced from the $Z^0$ and is complementary to\nanalyses using tau correlations since it provides the sign of the chirality\nparameter which is otherwise unavailable without recourse to lower energy\nexperiments where taus are unpolarized. Results of Monte Carlo studies and\ncomments regarding the use of the technique in experiments are also included.\n", "  There now exist several theoretical technologies for treating weak decays of\nheavy flavour hadrons that are genuinely based on QCD without having to invoke\na deus ex machina. I focus on one of those, which employs an expansion in\ninverse powers of the heavy quark mass. It has developed into a rather mature\nframework incorporating many subtle aspects of quantum field theory. I describe\nits methodology for treating fully integrated decay rates as well as\ndifferential distributions, in particular energy spectra; the importance of a\nnew type of sum rules, the SV sum rules, is emphasized. First practical\nbenefits from this theoretical technology are listed, like predictions on\nlifetime ratios and extracting the KM parameter $|V(cb)|$ from inclusive and\nfrom exclusive semileptonic $B$ decays. An outlook is given onto future\ndevelopments concerning the determination of the properly defined mass of the\nheavy quark and its kinetic energy and a reliable extraction of\n$|V(ub)/V(cb)|$. A few comments on charm decays are added.\n", "  The unification of gauge coupling constants in the minimal supersymmetric\nmodel (MSSM) is unaffected at the one-loop level by the inclusion of additional\nmass-degenerate SU(5) multiplets. Perturbativity puts an upper limit on the\nnumber of additional fields. We analyse the evolution of the gauge coupling\nconstants in all models satisfying these criteria using two-loop $\\beta$\nfunctions and including low energy threshold effects. We find that similarly to\nthe minimal supersymmetric model (MSSM) unification takes place within the\ntheoretical and experimental errors. The dominant proton decay mode is more\nsuppressed in all extended models as opposed to the MSSM due to renormalization\ngroup effects. However, the prediction for the bottom to $\\tau$ mass ratio\nbecomes worse in all models under consideration.\n", "  In connection with planned experiments devoted to investigation of\nsemileptonic decays of beauty baryons Isgur-Wise function and observables of\n$\\Lambda_b$ baryon (decay rates and distributions, leptonic spectra and\nasymmetry parameters) are calculated in the framework of diquark model with\ntaking into account of infrared regime for heavy quark.\n", "  Invited Talk presented at the First Arctic Workshop on Particle Physics,\nSaariselkae, August 1994 and at the Workshop on Elementary Particles and\nQuantum Field Theory, Moscow, September 1994\n", "  The hadronic decay of radially and orbitally excited charmonium above charm\nthreshold by $^3 P_{0}$ pair creation and chromoelectric flux--tube breaking is\ndiscussed in an harmonic oscillator approximation. We find independent evidence\nfrom a study of widths for a 2S admixture in the predominantly 1D state\n$\\psi(3770)$, and explore the possibility of metastable radially excited $2 \\;\n^{3}P_{0,1,2}$ states being a source of the anomalously large production of\n$\\psi^{'}$ at the Tevatron. At least one of them is expected to be narrow as a\nconsequence of the existence of nodes in the radial wave function.\n", "  We discuss the longitudinal and transverse $\\tau$-polarization in inclusive\ndecays of hadrons containing $b$-quarks. The calculation is performed by means\nof an OPE in HQET. Some mathematical difficulties in calculating transverse\npolarizations are explained. Numerical results are presented for longitudinal\nand for transverse polarizations, both in and perpendicular to the decay plane.\n", "  It is generally assumed that due to factorization of long- and short-distance\ndynamics perturbative QCD can be applied to exclusive hadronic reactions at\nlarge momentum transfers. Within such a perturbative approach diquarks turn out\nto be a useful phenomenological device to model non-perturbative effects still\nobservable in the kinematic range accessible by present-days experiments. The\nbasic ingredients of the perturbative formalism with diquarks, i.e. Feynman\nrules for diquarks and quark-diquark wave functions of baryons, are briefly\nsummarized. Applications of the diquark model to the electromagnetic form\nfactors of the proton in the space- as well as time-like region,\nCompton-scattering off protons, gamma-gamma -> p-pbar, and photoproduction of\nKaons are discussed.\n", "  Spontaneous violation of R parity can induce rare single photon decays of the\n$Z^0$ involving the emission of (nearly) massless pseudoscalar Goldstone\nbosons, majorons, as well as massive CP even or CP odd spin zero bosons that\narise in the electroweak breaking sector of these models. We show that the\nmajoron emitting decays can have a sizeable branching ratio of $10^{-5}$ or so,\nwithout conflicting any experimental observation from neutrino physics or\nparticle searches. These decays may lead to interesting structures for the\nsingle photon spectrum involving either mono chromatic photons as well as\ncontinuous spectra that grow with energy. They would easily account for an\nexcess of single photon events at high energies recently hinted at by the OPAL\ncollaboration.\n", "  A brief review is made of some of the experimental signatures that may be\nassociated to a certain class of extensions of the standard model. The material\nof these lectures is divided into two sections. After briefly sketching the\npresent observational status of the neutrino masses I consider various schemes\nof neutrino mass generation, including those which are motivated by present\nexperimental hints from solar and atmospheric neutrinos, as well as\ncosmological data on the amplitude of primordial density fluctuations. Then\nsome of the physics motivations and potential of various extensions of the\nstandard model related to the electroweak breaking sector, such as\nsupersymmetry, and extensions of the gauge boson sector are reviewed. The new\nsignatures associated with both types of extension may all be accessible to\nexperiments performed either at accelerators or at underground installations.\nThe complementarity between these two approaches in the search for signals\nbeyond the standard model is most vividly manifest in the field of neutrino\nphysics.\n", "  Hadron masses are shown to be separable in QCD into contributions of quark\nand gluon kinetic and potential energies, quark masses, and the trace anomaly.\nThe separation is based on a study of the structure of the QCD energy-momentum\ntensor and its matrix elements in hadron states. The paper contains two parts.\nIn the first part, a detailed discussion of the renormalization properties of\nthe energy-momentum tensor is given. In the second part, a mass separation\nformula is derived and then applied to the nucleon, pion, and the QCD vacuum.\nImplications of the results on hadron structure and non-perturbative QCD\ndynamics are discussed.\n", "  We show that the Nambu-Goldstone(NG) boson restricted on the light-front(LF)\ncan only exist if we regularize the theory by introducing the explicit breaking\nNG-boson mass $m_{\\pi}$. The NG-boson zero mode, when integrated over the LF,\nmust have a singular behavior $\\sim 1/m^2_{\\pi}$ in the symmetric limit of\n$m^2_{\\pi}\\rightarrow 0$. In the discretized LF quantization this peculiarity\nis clarified in terms of the zero-mode constraints in the linear $\\sigma$\nmodel. The LF charge annihilates the vacuum, while it is not conserved in the\nsymmetric limit in the NG phase.\n", "  Real-time thermal field theory is known in the two flavors ``closed-time path\nformalism'' and ``thermo field dynamics''. With a certain choice of parameters\nthe full two-point functions of these models are identical, hence a scheme to\ndiagonalize the Green function in one model can be applied to the other as\nwell. This allows to compare the diagonalization schemes that have been\ndiscussed in the recent literature in order to select the simplest one. Such\ncomparison speaks in favor of a diagonalization method which is motivated from\nthermo field dynamics.\n", "  Nucleon form factors are calculated in a relativistic diquark--quark picture\nbased on the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model. The nucleon wave function is obtained\nin a static approximation to the quark exchange interaction between the valence\nquark and the diquark. We evaluate the valence quark and $0^+$--diquark\ncontribution to the nucleon electromagnetic and weak currents. We find\nreasonable electric charge radii, magnetic moments as in the additive diquark\nmodel, and $g_A \\approx 1$. We discuss the dependence on the model parameters.\n", "  In this paper, we develop a general framework to study the\nmeson-photoproductions of nucleons in the chiral quark model. The S and U\nchannel resonance contributions are expressed in terms of the\nChew-Goldberger-Low-Nambu (CGLN) amplitudes. The kaon-photoproduction\nprocesses, $\\gamma p\\to K^+ \\Lambda$, $\\gamma p\\to K^+ \\Sigma^0$, and $\\gamma\np\\to K^0\\Sigma^+$, are calculated. The initial results show that the quark\nmodel provides a much improved description of the reaction mechanism for the\nkaon-photoproductions of the nucleon with less parameters than the traditional\nphenomenological approaches.\n", "  We study some of the consequences of the SU(6)$_{L}\\otimes$U(1)$_{Y}$ model\nof unification of electroweak interactions and families with a horizontal gauge\ngroup SU(2)$_{H}$, paying special attention to processes with flavor changing\nneutral currents. We compute at tree level the decays $K^{+}\\longrightarrow\n\\pi^{+}\\mu^{+}e^{-}$, $K_L^0\\longrightarrow \\mu^{+}e^{-}$ and $\\mu^{-}\n\\longrightarrow e^{-} \\bar{\\nu_e} \\nu_\\mu$ from which we obtain lower bounds\nfor the mass of the horizontal gauge boson associated with FCNC. Finally we\nobtain limits on the mixing between ordinary and exotic charged leptons.\n", "  The role of matter enhanced resonant neutrino oscillations in reviving a\nstalled shock in a type-II supernova through delayed neutrino heating is\ninvestigated. The extent of neutrino heating is estimated for the allowed\npossibility of complete flavour conversion self-consistently with the changes\nin nuclear equilibrium. The average internal energy per nucleon is\nsubstantially increased indicating the possiblty of a robust explosion.\n", "  The $I=0,1,2,3$ mass splittings of the spin-$1/2$ octet and spin-$3/2$\ndecuplet baryons are analyzed in the $1/\\N$ expansion combined with\nperturbative flavor breaking. We show there is considerable experimental\nevidence that the baryon masses satisfy the hierarchy predicted by this\nexpansion. Since flavor symmetry-breaking suppression factors alone are not\nsufficient to describe the observed hierarchy, we conclude that there is firm\nevidence for the $1/\\N$ expansion in the baryon masses. Our analysis differs\nfrom non-relativistic $SU(6)$.\n", "  The second order formalism for fermions provides a description of fermions\nthat is very similar to that of scalars. We demonstrate that this second order\nformalism is equivalent to the standard Dirac formalism. We do so in terms of\nthe conventional fermionic Feynman rules. The second order formalism has\npreviously proven useful for the computation of fermion loops, here we describe\nhow the corresponding rules can be applied to the calculation of amplitudes\ninvolving external fermions, including tree-level processes and processes with\nmore than one fermion line. We comment on the supersymmetric identities\nrelating fermions and scalars and the associated simplifications to\nperturbative calculations that are then more transparent.\n", "  We investigated how measurements of weak boson production at high energy $ep$\nand $e\\gamma$ collisions can provide important information on anomalous\n$WW\\gamma$ couplings. We also considerd the sinlge muon production through the\nvirtual $W$-decay at the Pohang Light Source (PLS) facility, and found this\nprocess is not adequate to be detected at the PLS until a large luminosity\n($\\sim 10^{33}$/sec/cm$^2$) Free Electron Laser is installed.\n", "  The object of this brief review is to reconcile different points of view on\nhow the spin of proton is made up from its constituents. On the basis of naive\nquark model with flavour symmetry such as isospin or SU(3) one finds a static\ndescription. On the contrary the local SU(3) colour symmetry gives a dynamical\nview. Both these views are contrasted and the role of U(1) axial anomaly and\nthe ambiguity for the measurable spin content is discussed.\n", "  A study of the $J/\\psi$-meson production at large transverse momentum in high\nenergy $\\gamma p$ collisions via the charm quark excitation in a photon is\npresented. Based on perturbative QCD and the nonrelativistic quark model, our\ncalculation demonstrates that the charm content of a photon may be very\nimportant for the $J/\\psi$ photoproduction at the large transverse momentum. It\nis shown that at HERA energies $J/\\psi$ production via the subprocess $cg\\to\nJ/\\si c$ dominates over the resolved photon contribution via the subprocess\n$gg\\to J/\\psi g$ at $p_{\\bot}>3$ GeV/c and over the direct photon-gluon fusion\ncontribution at $p_{bot}>10$ GeV/c.\n", "  Including the Haar measure we show that the effective potential of the\nregularized SU(2) Yang-Mills theory has a minimum at vanishing Wilson-line\n$W=0$ for strong coupling, whereas it develops two degenerate minima close to\n$W=\\pm 1$ for weak coupling. This suggests that the non-abelian character of\n$SU(2)$ as contained in the Haar measure might be responsible for confinement.\n", "  We discuss how to extract the spectroscopy of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) in\nthe pure gauge sector from the Hamiltonian lattice field theory approach. The\nrecently developed truncated eigenvalue equation method is applied to the\nestimation of the scalar glueball $0^{++}$ and $0^{--}$ masses in the\n(2+1)-dimensional case. These masses reach the constant values in a scaling\nregion as required by the renormalizability.\n", "  In our recent paper (hep-ph/9501348) we argued that the Bjorken variable $x$\nin deep inelastic scattering cannot be interpreted as the light cone momentum\nfraction $\\xi$ even in the Bjorken limit and in zero order of the perturbation\ntheory. The purpose of the present paper is to qualitatively explain this fact\nusing only a few simplest kinematical relations.\n", "  Both Cabibbo allowed and doubly forbidden transitions contribute coherently\nto $D\\rightarrow K_{S,L}+\\pi 's$ decays. This leads to several intriguing and\neven quantitatively significant consequences, among them: (i) A difference\nbetween $\\Gamma (D^+\\rightarrow K_S \\pi ^+)$ and $\\Gamma (D^+\\rightarrow K_L\n\\pi ^+)$ and between $\\Gamma (D^0\\rightarrow K_S \\pi ^0)$ and $\\Gamma\n(D^0\\rightarrow K_L \\pi ^0)$ of roughly 10\\% ; similarly $\\Gamma\n(D^+\\rightarrow [K_S\\pi ^0]_{K^*} \\pi ^+) \\neq \\frac{1}{4}\\Gamma\n(D^+\\rightarrow [K^-\\pi ^+]_{K^*} \\pi ^+)$, and more generally $\\Gamma\n(D\\rightarrow \\bar K^0+\\pi 's) \\neq 2\\Gamma (D\\rightarrow K_S+\\pi 's)$. (ii) A\nchange in the relative phase between the isospin 3/2 and 1/2 amplitudes as\nextracted from the observed branching ratios for $D^+\\rightarrow K_S\\pi ^+$,\n$D^0\\rightarrow K_S\\pi ^0 ,\\, K^-\\pi ^+$. (iii) If New Physics intervenes to\nprovide the required {\\em weak} phase, then CP asymmetries of up to a few per\ncent can arise in $D^+\\rightarrow K_S\\pi ^+$ vs. $D^-\\rightarrow K_S\\pi ^-$,\n$D^0\\rightarrow K_S\\pi ^0$ vs. $\\bar D^0\\rightarrow K_S\\pi ^0$, $D^+\\rightarrow\n[K_S\\pi ^0]_{K^*}\\pi ^+$ vs. $D^-\\rightarrow [K_S\\pi ^0]_{K^*}\\pi ^-$, etc.; an\nasymmetry of the same size, but opposite in sign occurs when the $K_S$ is\nreplaced by a $K_L$ in the final state.\n", "  Flavor changing neutral current and CP violating processes are discussed in\nthe minimal supergravity model. The constraint on charged Higgs mass from the\nnew measurement of the inclusive branching ratio of the $b\\rightarrow s\\gamma$\nprocess is obtained. The $B^0_d-\\bar{B}^0_d$ mixing parameter ($x_d$) and the\nCP violating parameter in the $K^0-\\bar{K}^0$ mixing ($\\epsilon _K$) are\ncalculated in this model and it is shown that these parameters can be enhanced\nby 10\\% $\\sim$ 20 \\% compared to the prediction within the standard model.\nImpacts on new physics search at B factories are also discussed.\n", "  These lecture notes begin with a brief survey of the physics of heavy quark\nsystems. This discusion motivates the introduction of the Heavy Quark Effective\ntheory (HQET) which captures a great deal of the intuition developed. A\nderivation of the HQET from QCD is presented as well as an analysis of its\nspecial properties. The effective theory can be seen to amount to a\none-dimensional field theory in the quark sector. The heavy quark flavour- and\nspin- symmetry of the effective lagrangian is an offspring of this. Other\ntopics covered include the question of covariance of the theory, the\nconstruction of interpolating fields for the heavy hadron states, the\napplication of LSZ reduction theorems to determine the (reduced) number of form\nfactors in flavour changing transitions, a complete verification of Luke's\ntheorem, plus the matching conditions between QCD and the HQET beyond tree\nlevel. These are an expanded version of lectures presented during the Trieste\n1994 Summer school on High Energy physics.\n", "  Low-baryon number lumps of strange quark matter, strangelets, are presently\nsearched for in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion experiments at CERN and\nBrookhaven. This paper gives an overview of the physical properties of\nstrangelets with emphasis on experimental signatures such as mass and charge.\nDirect solutions of the Dirac equation with MIT bag model boundary conditions\nare applied and compared to calculations based on a smoothed density of states,\nas well as to simple mass-formulae based on the MIT bag. Most strangelet\nproperties can be understood within an approximation including bulk, surface\nand curvature energy contributions.\n", "  We calculate the electric quadrupole to magnetic dipole transition ratio\n$E2/M1$ for the reaction $\\gamma N \\ra \\Delta(1232)$ in the chiral quark\nsoliton model. The calculated $E2/M1$ ratio is in a good agreement with the\nvery new experimental data. We obtain non-zero negative value for the electric\nquadrupole $N-\\Delta$ transition moment, which suggests an oblate deformed\ncharge structure of the nucleon or/and the delta isobar. Other observables\nrelated to this quantity, namely the $N-\\Delta$ mass splitting, the isovector\ncharge radius, and isovector magnetic moment, are properly reproduced as well.\n", "  We discuss the possible symmetries of the effective lagrangian describing\ninteracting pseudoscalar-, vector-, and axial-vector mesons. Specific choices\nof the parameters give rise to an $[SU(2)\\otimes SU(2)]^3$ symmetry. This\nsymmetry can be obtained either {\\it \\'a la} Georgi, with all states in the\nspectrum remaining massless, or in a new realization, implying decoupling of\nthe pseudoscalar bosons from degenerate vector and axial-vector mesons. This\nsecond possibility, when minimally coupled with $SU(2)\\otimes U(1)$ electroweak\ngauge vector bosons, seems particularly appealing. All deviations in the\nlow-energy electroweak parameters are strongly suppressed, and the vector and\naxial-vector states turn out to be quite narrow. A nearby strong electroweak\nsector would then be conceivable and in principle it could be explored with\nrelatively low energy accelerators.\n", "  We use a $1S$ lattice QCD heavy-light wavefunction to generate a single\nparameter, model independent description of the Isgur-Wise function. Using\nrecent data we find the zero-recoil slope to be $\\xi'(1)= -1.16\\pm 0.17$, while\nthe second derivative turns out to be $\\xi''(1)= 2.64\\pm 0.74$.\n", "  The Feynman-Hellmann theorem and semiempirical mass formulas are used to\npredict the masses of baryons containing one or two heavy quarks. In\nparticular, the mass of the $\\Lambda_b$ is predicted to be $5620 \\pm 40$ MeV, a\nvalue consistent with measurements.\n", "  I survey the use of the Haag expansion as a technique to solve quantum field\ntheories. After an exposition of the asymptotic condition and the Haag\nexpansion, I report the results of applying the Haag expansion to several\nquantum field theories, including galilean-invariant theories, matter at finite\ntemperature (using the BCS model of superconductivity as an illustrative\nexample), the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model and the Schwinger model. I conclude\nwith the outlook for further development of this method.\n", "  These lectures are an introduction to the subject of chiral effective\nLagrangians of the Standard Model and their applications, mostly in the sector\nof non--leptonic kaon decays, with special emphasis on CP--violation. The first\nlecture gives an introduction to the phenomenological description of the\n$K^0-\\bar{K}^0$ system and $K\\ra \\pi\\pi$ decays. In the second lecture I give\nan overview of the basic ideas behind the chiral perturbation theory ($\\chi$PT)\n--approach to hadron dynamics at low energies. The study of the weak\ninteractions of $K$--particles within the framework of $\\chi$PT is the subject\nof the third lecture. The fourth lecture is an overview of various models of\nthe QCD low--energy effective action which have been developed during the last\nfew years. The fifth lecture is dedicated to a discussion of the CP--violation\n$\\epsilon$ and $\\epsilon'$ parameters, and to the study of the decay mode:\n$K_{L}\\ra \\pi^{0}e^{+}e^{-}$.\n", "  A ring-laser experiment, similar to the Canterbury ring laser, to detect\naxion- and {\\sc qed}-induced vacuum birefringence is proposed. It uses a slowly\nmodulated magnetic field and a novel polarization geometry. Both axion coupling\nand vacuum birefringence would modulate the Sagnac beat frequency. A null\nresult could place sensitive bounds on the axion mass and on two-photon\ncoupling.\n", "  In a recent paper \\cite{ft} a new powerful method to calculate Feynman\ndiagrams was proposed. It consists in setting up a Taylor series expansion in\nthe external momenta squared. The Taylor coefficients are obtained from the\noriginal diagram by differentiation and putting the external momenta equal to\nzero. It was demonstrated that by a certain conformal mapping and subsequent\nresummation by means of Pad\\'{e} approximants it is possible to obtain high\nprecision numerical values of the Feynman integrals in the whole cut plane. The\nreal problem in this approach is the calculation of the Taylor coefficients for\nthe arbitrary mass case. Since their analytic evaluation by means of CA\npackages uses enormous CPU and yields very lengthy expressions, we develop an\nalgorithm with the aim to set up a FORTRAN package for their numerical\nevaluation. This development is guided by the possibilities offered by the\nformulae manipulating language FORM \\cite{FORM}.\n", "  We compute the electromagnetic mass differences of mesons containing a single\nheavy quark in terms of measurable data using QCD-based arguments in\nheavy-quark effective theory. We derive an unsubtracted dispersion relation\nthat shows that the mass differences are calculable in terms of the properties\nof the lowest-lying physical intermediate states. We then consider the problem\nin the large-$N$ limit, where $N$ is the number of QCD colors. In this limit,\nwe can write a kind of double-dispersion relation for the amplitude required to\ndetermine the electromagnetic mass difference. We use this to derive analogs of\nthe Weinberg sum rules for heavy meson matrix elements valid to leading order\nin $1/N$ and to $O(1/m_Q)$ in the heavy quark expansion. In order to obtain our\nfinal result, we assume that the electromagnetic mass differences and sum rules\nare dominated by the lowest-lying states in analogy with the situation for the\n$\\pi^+$--$\\pi^0$ mass difference. Despite the fact that some of the matrix\nelements appearing in our final result have not yet been accurately measured,\nwe can obtain useful numerical estimates: for example, we obtain $(M_{B^+} -\nM_{B^0})^{EM} \\simeq +1.8 \\MeV$. We argue that our results are accurate to\nabout $30\\%$.\n", "  Up to now, almost all discussion of supersymmetry at future colliders has\nbeen concerned with particle searches. However, if candidates for\nsupersymmetric particles are found, there is much more that we will want to\nknow about them. Supersymmetry predicts quantitative relations among the\ncouplings and masses of supersymmetric particles. We discuss the prospects for\ntesting such relations at a future $e^+e^-$ linear collider, using measurements\nthat exploit the availability of polarized beams. Precision tests from chargino\nproduction are investigated in two representative cases, and sfermion and\nneutralino processes are also discussed.\n", "  We recall our recent description of quark parton densities of the proton at\n$Q^2=4 GeV^2$ in terms of Fermi-Dirac distributions parametrized with very few\nfree parameters. We have also proposed some simple assumptions to relate\nunpolarized and polarized quark parton densities which lead to a fair\ndescription of the spin-dependent structure functions $xg^p_1(x,Q^2)$ and\n$xg^n_1(x,Q^2)$ at low $Q^2$. We will show the predictions we obtain after a\nstraightforward DGLAP $Q^2$ evolution and comparison in a much broader $x$ and\n$Q^2$ range, with several recent and accurate deep-inelastic scattering data.\nIn particular, we will see that we get an excellent agreement with the sharp\nrise of $F^{ep}_2(x,Q^2)$ for small $x$, recently observed at HERA. Finally, we\ngive several predictions for lepton pair and gauge boson production in $pp$ and\n$pn$ collisions at high energies which will be tested in the future at RHIC.\n", "  The small x behaviour of the non-singlet structure function is studied within\nthe double logarithmic approximation (DLA) of perturbative QCD. Since there is\nneither $k_T$ nor $\\theta$ ordering in the ladder Feynman graphs, the predicted\nnon-singlet quark densities for the HERA kinematical range ($x\\sim 10^{-3}$)\nexceed the values calculated from the small-$x$ approximation of the\nconventional Altarelli-Parisi evolution by a factor up to ten.\n", "  In this talk, I focus on the quark-gluon structure of hadrons probed using\nhigh-energy hadron beams. I start with a brief review on recent major\nachievements in measuring parton distributions of the nucleon, pion, and kaon,\nwith hadron facilities at CERN and FNAL\\@. Then I discuss a number of\noutstanding questions and interesting physics issues in the field, and point\nout their intellectual impact on nuclear physics as a whole. While advocating a\ncontinuing exploitation of hadron beams at CERN and FNAL, I strongly emphasize\nthe role of a polarized RHIC, where a major nuclear physics program on the\nstructure of hadrons can thrive.\n", "  In a wide class of extensions of the Standard Model there is a scalar\nresonance with the quantum numbers of the usual Higgs boson but with different\ncouplings to fermions and gauge bosons. Using an effective Lagrangian\ndescription, we examine the phenomenology of such a generic nonstandard Higgs\nboson at the LHC. In particular, we determine the circumstances under which\nsuch a particle can be observed in its $ZZ$ decay mode and distinguished from\nthe Higgs boson of the Standard Model. We briefly comment on the energy scale\neffectively probed at the LHC, if the nonstandard nature of an observed Higgs\nparticle can be asserted.\n", "  The emission of particles from black holes created in the early Universe has\ndetectable astrophysical consequences. The most stringent bound on their\nabundance has been obtained from the absence of a detectable diffuse flux of\n100 MeV photons. Further scrutiny of these bounds is of interest as they, for\ninstance, rule out primordial black holes as a dark matter candidate. We here\npoint out that these bounds can, in principle, be improved by studying the\ndiffuse cosmic neutrino flux. Measurements of near-vertical atmospheric\nneutrino fluxes in a region of low geomagnetic latitude can provide a\ncompetitive bound. The most favorable energy to detect a possible diffuse flux\nof primordial black hole origin is found to be a few MeV. We also show that\nmeasurements of the diffuse $\\nu _\\tau$ flux is the most promising to improve\nthe existing bounds deduced from gamma-ray measurements. Neutrinos from\nindividual black hole explosions can be detected in the GeV-TeV energy region.\nWe find that the kilometer-scale detectors, recently proposed, are able to\nestablish competitive bounds.\n", "  Using a simple kinetic model we study whether a pion condensate can be formed\nduring the hadronization of the quark-gluon plasma in ultrarelativistic\nheavy-ion collisions. If hadronization proceeds fast and the pion effective\nmass is close to zero, some pions condense into the zero momentum state. On the\nother hand, for the pion effective mass equal to the vacuum one or larger no\nonset of the Bose-Einstein condensation is observed. The constraints on the\ncondensation process coming from the requirement of the entropy increase are\ndiscussed in detail.\n", "  The possibility that the epsilon expansion can predict the order of phase\ntransitions in three dimensional field theories is examined. For a Hermitean\nmatrix-valued order parameter, the epsilon expansion predicts fluctuation\ninduced first order phase transitions. We analyze two 2+1-dimensional quantum\nfield theories which exhibit spontaneous symmetry breaking and have martix\norder parameters. Using the large $N$ expansion, we show that these models\nexhibit second order transitions and discuss the implications for the chiral\nsymmetry breaking transition in 2+1-dimensional QCD for a critical number of\nquark flavors.\n", "  As described previously, a new massive gauge boson (X) coupling only to the\nthird family produces a tantalizing pattern of deviations away from the\nstandard model. These include increasing Gamma_b/Gamma_h and decreasing the\nalpha_s(M_Z) extracted from Gamma_h/Gamma_ell . We review the status of these\nX-Z mixing effects. We then calculate X boson induced vertex corrections to Z\npartial decay widths and to ttbar production in ppbar colliders.\n", "  Decays of the D mesons to two pseudoscalars, to two vectors, and to\npseudoscalar plus vector are discussed in the context of broken flavor SU(3). A\nfew assumptions are used to reduce the number of parameters. Amplitudes are fit\nto the available data, and predictions of branching ratios for unmeasured modes\nare made.\n", "  Nonperturbative features of QCD are studied using the dual Ginzburg-Landau\n(DGL) theory with QCD-monopoles. The linear quark potential appears in the\nQCD-monopole condensed vacuum. We find that QCD-monopole condensation plays an\nessential role to the dynamical chiral-symmetry breaking. We also investigate\nthe QCD phase transition at finite temperature in the DGL theory.\n", "  We study the pure-gauge QCD phase transition at finite temperatures in the\ndual Ginzburg-Landau theory, an effective theory of QCD based on the dual Higgs\nmechanism. We formulate the effective potential at various temperatures by\nintroducing the quadratic source term, which is a new useful method to obtain\nthe effective potential in the negative-curvature region. Thermal effects\nreduce the QCD-monopole condensate and bring a first-order deconfinement phase\ntransition. We find a large reduction of the self-interaction among\nQCD-monopoles and the glueball masses near the critical temperature by\nconsidering the temperature dependence of the self-interaction. We also\ncalculate the string tension at finite temperatures.\n", "  We study nonperturbative features of QCD using the dual Ginzburg-Landau (DGL)\ntheory, where the color confinement is realized through the dual Higgs\nmechanism brought by QCD-monopole condensation. The linear confinement\npotential appears in the QCD-monopole condensed vacuum. We study the infrared\nscreening effect to the confinement potential by the light-quark pair creation,\nand derive a compact formula for the screened quark potential. We study the\ndynamical chiral-symmetry breaking (D$\\chi $SB) in the DGL theory by solving\nthe Schwinger-Dyson equation. QCD-monopole condensation plays an essential role\nto D$\\chi $SB. The QCD phase transition at finite temperature is studied using\nthe effective potential formalism in the DGL theory. We find the reduction of\nQCD-monopole condensation and the string tension at high temperatures. The\nsurface tension is calculated using the effective potential at the critical\ntemperature. The DGL theory predicts a large mass reduction of glueballs near\nthe critical temperature. We apply the DGL theory to the quark-gluon-plasma\n(QGP) physics in the ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions. We propose a new\nscenario of the QGP formation via the annihilation of color-electric flux tubes\nbased on the attractive force between them.\n", "  We calculate the inclusive production of charged hadrons in $\\pbp$ collisions\nto next-to-leading order (NLO) in the QCD improved parton model using a new set\nof NLO fragmentation functions for charged pions and kaons. We predict\ntransverse-momentum distributions and compare them with experimental data from\nthe CERN S$\\pbp$S Collider and the Fermilab Tevatron.\n", "  The infinite mass effective theory, when a heavy quark mass tends to\ninfinity, and Chiral perturbation theory at the quark level, based on the\nextended Nambu -- Jona -- Lasinio model with linear realization of chiral\n$U(3)\\times U(3)$ symmetry, are applied to the calculation of current $s$ --\nquark mass corrections to the form factors of the $D\\to\\bar K~e^+~\\nu_e$ and\n$D\\to\\bar K^{\\ast}~e^+~\\nu_e$ decays. These corrections turn out to be quite\nsignificant, of the order of $7-20\\%$. The theoretical results are compared\nwith experimental data.\n", "  We investigate the reactions $e^-e^- \\rightarrow W_i^-W_j^-$ for various\ngauge bosons production processes in the frame of the standard model with\nadditional right-handed neutrinos and the Left-Right symmetric model. The\npresent bounds on the various model parameters are taken into account. The\nquestion of the cross section behaviour for large energy and the CP violation\nproblems are discussed.\n", "  The center-of-mass(CM) of a few-body quantum system with a central field is\ndiscussed. If the particles are in the designative eigenstates, the CM\ncoordinates of the system can be well-defined. In the CM bag model as well as\nin other models with central fields, the CM-freedom separation rule and\neffective nucleon electro-magnetic currents can be presented without any\nundetermined parameter.\n", "  I discuss in this talk the physics of the $Q^2$ dependence of the\n$G_1(x,Q^2)$ structure function sum rule. For $Q^2>3$ GeV$^2$, the $Q^2$\nvariation is controlled by pure QCD radiative corrections. For $0.5<Q^2<3$\nGeV$^2$, the twist-four contribution becomes significant, but stays\nperturbative. For $Q^2$ below $\\sim 0.05$, the sum rule is determined by\nlow-energy theorems. The rapid change of the sum rule between 0.05 and 0.5\nGeV$^2$ signals the transition between parton and hadron degrees of freedom.\n", "  We consider the collisions of large nuclei using the theory of McLerran and\nVenugopalan. The two nuclei are ultra-relativistic and sources of non-abelian\nWeizs\\\"acker-Williams fields. These sources are in the end averaged over all\ncolor orientations locally with a Gaussian weight. We show that there is a\nsolution of the equations of motion for the two nucleus scattering problem\nwhere the fields are time and rapidity independent before the collision. After\nthe collision the solution depends on proper time, but is independent of\nrapidity. We show how to extract the produced gluons from the classical\nevolution of the fields.\n", "  The three-loop QCD corrections to the $\\rho$ parameter from top and bottom\nquark loops are calculated. The result differs from the one recently calculated\nby Avdeev et al. As function of the pole mass the numerical value is given by\n$\\drho=\\frac{3G_F M_t^2}{8\\sqrt{2}\\pi^2}(1- 2.8599 \\api - 14.594 (\\api)^2 )$.\n", "  In relativistic potential models of quarkonia based on a Dirac-type of\nequation with a local potential there is a sharp distinction between a linear\npotential V which is vector-like and one which is scalar-like: There are\nnormalizable solutions for a scalar-like V but not for a vector-like V. It is\npointed out that if instead one uses an equation of the no-pair type, which is\nmore natural from the viewpoint of field theory, this somewhat bizarre\ndifference disappears.\n", "  We suggest the use of a universality-breaking observable based on lepton\nasymmetries as derived from the left-right asymmetry and the $\\tau$\npolarization at the $Z$ peak, which can efficiently constrain the parameter\nspace of unified theories. The new observable is complementary to the leptonic\npartial width differences and it depends critically on the chirality of a\npossible non-universal $Z$-boson coupling to like-flavour leptons. The LEP/SLC\npotential of probing universality violation is discussed in representative\nlow-energy extensions of the Standard Model (SM) that could be derived by\nsupersymmetric grand unified theories, such as the SM with left-handed and/or\nright-handed neutral isosinglets, the left-right symmetric model, and the\nminimal supersymmetric SM.\n", "  The hadronic contributions to the anomalous magnetic moments of the leptons\nand to the effective fine structure constant at the Z-mass are reevaluated\nusing all presently available $e^+ e^-$ data.\n", "  The measured ratios $R(x,A_1/A_2)$ for $J/\\Psi$, $\\Psi'$ and $\\mu^+\\mu^-$\nproduction on two different targets $A_1, A_2$ as a function of the fractional\nmomentum $x$ of the final state are well fit with a very simple functional form\nhaving three adjustable parameters. An empirical relation is found between the\nthree parameters of the fit. The deduced $J/\\Psi$ absorption cross sections\n$\\sigma_{abs}$ cluster around two values of which only $\\sigma_{abs} = 5.8 \\pm\n0.2$ mb seems acceptable.\n", "  We find that various results of current algebra at tree level and beyond can\nbe directly obtained from a master formula, without use of chiral perturbation\ntheory or effective Lagrangians. Application is made to $\\pi \\pi$ scattering,\nwhere it is shown that the bulk of the $\\rho$ contribution can be determined in\na model independent way.\n", "  We present a systematic search for SUSY-SO(10) models which predict the\nneutrino properties. The models are based on the five sets of quark mass\nmatrices, with texture zeros, discussed recently by Roberts, Ramond and Ross.\nWe found 8 such neutrino textures three of which can solve the solar neutrino\nproblem. The latter have tau-neutrino masses of few eV i.e. relevant for\ncosmology and $\\nu_{\\tau} - \\nu_{\\mu}$ mixing angles that can be observed by\nthe CHORUS, NOMAD and P803 experiments.\n", "  After giving a short introduction to the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model with an\nanomaly term, we show the importance of the scalar-scalar correlation in the\nlow-energy hadron dynamics, which correlation may be summarized by a\nscalar-isoscalar meson, the sigma meson. The discussion is based on the chiral\nquark model with the sigma-meson degrees of freedom. Possible experiments are\nproposed to produce the elusive meson in a nucleus and detect it. In relation\nto a precursory soft mode for the chiral transition, the reason is clarified\nwhy the dynamic properties of the superconductor may be described by the\ndiffusive time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau (TDGL) equation. We indicate the\nchiral symmetry plays a significant role also in nuclei; one may say that the\nstability of nuclei is due to the chiral symmetry of QCD.\n", "  In the light of the $\\nu_\\mu\\to\\nu_e$ neutrino oscillations which may have\nbeen observed at the LSND experiment we explore the consequences of two\ninverted mass schemes where solar neutrino oscillations occur between $\\nu_e$\nand $\\nu_\\tau$. The favored LSND value $\\Delta m^2=6\\,\\eV^2$ leads to\n$m_{\\nu_e}\\approx m_{\\nu_\\tau}\\approx 2.5\\,\\eV$ and $m_{\\nu_\\mu}\\approx0$ so\nthat cosmology can benefit from a recently proposed ``cold plus hot dark\nmatter'' structure formation scenario with two equal mass light neutrinos\n(C$\\nu^2$DM). Solar neutrino oscillations ($\\nu_e\\to\\nu_\\tau$) can occur with\none of the large mixing angle solutions so that a serious conflict with\n$\\beta\\beta$ decay Majorana mass limits is avoided without invoking Dirac\nmasses. However, there is a problem with the SN~1987A signal because of\nresonant $\\anti\\nu_e\\leftrightarrow\\anti\\nu_\\mu$ oscillations which are\nexpected to cause far higher $\\anti\\nu_e$ energies at the IMB and Kamiokande~II\ndetectors than have been observed. A small value $\\Delta m^2=0.5\\,\\eV^2$ at\nLSND, which allows for a relatively large $\\nu_e$-$\\nu_\\mu$ mixing angle\nwithout conflicting with the KARMEN and BNL-E776 experiments, would indicate\n$m_{\\nu_e}\\approx m_{\\nu_\\tau}\\approx 1.62\\,\\eV$ and\n$m_{\\nu_\\mu}\\approx1.77\\,\\eV$. This scheme of C$\\nu^3$DM maintains, and even\nmay improve, the essential cosmological model implications for large-scale\nstructure, leaving no conflict with SN r-process nucleosynthesis. It may\nimprove the discordance between the SN~1987A neutrino spectra inferred from\nKamiokande~II and IMB.\n", "  Using effective field theory techniques we discuss the QCD corrections to the\nlarge-$m_t$ contributions to the process $Z\\rightarrow b \\bar b$. In particular\nwe obtain the $\\a$ correction to the non-universal $\\log m_t$ contribution to\nthe $Zb\\bar b$ vertex.\n", "  In the present work we study the predictions for $WZ$ and $ZZ$ production at\nLHC with the Electroweak Chiral Lagrangian (EChL) approach. Our analysis will\nbe focused on the less favored case from the experimental point of view, in\nwhich the predictions for the gauge bosons scattering amplitudes are considered\nin the low energy range where, by construction of the low energy approach, they\nreveal no resonant behavior. The study includes the complete set of amplitudes\nfor all the polarization states of the initial and/or final gauge bosons and\nmakes no use of the Equivalence Theorem. We express the results in terms of the\nrange of values of the chiral parameters that will be accessible at LHC.\n", "  We consider first heavy particles with masses $M\\sim M_{GUT}$ which arise in\nthe Universe during phase transitions at the Grand Unification scale. Using\nstatistical mechanics approach we show that they behave like ideal quantum\ndegenerate Bose gas which has the temperature of the Hawking thermal radiation\ndue to presence of the de Sitter event horizon. The equation of state for both\nscalar and gauge bosons is presented including the coupling constant at the\nGrand Unification scale.\n", "  We have completed the ${\\cal O}(\\alpha_s)$ QCD corrections to exclusive heavy\nquark-antiquark distributions in deep inelastic electroproduction and present\nhere the differential distributions in the masses of charm-anticharm and\nbottom-antibottom pairs at the electron-proton collider HERA.\n", "  Dimensional reduction of high temperature field theories improves IR features\nof their perturbative treatment. A crucial question is, what three-dimensional\ntheory is representing the full system the most faithful way. Careful\ninvestigation of the induced 3-dimensional counterterm structure of the finite\ntemperature 4D O(N) symmetric scalar theory at 2-loop level leads to proposing\nthe presence of non-local operators in the effective theory. On scales beyond\n${\\cal O}(T^{-1})$, the scaling behavior of the couplings, consequently,\ndeviates from the usual three-dimensional scaling characteristic for\nsuperrenormalizable theories.\n", "  We argue that the effective pion mass in nuclear matter obtained from chiral\neffective lagrangians is unique and does not depend on off-mass-shell\nextensions of the pion fields as e.g. the PCAC choice. The effective pion mass\nin isospin symmetric nuclear matter is predicted to increase slightly with\nincreasing nuclear density, whereas the effective time-like pion decay constant\nand the magnitude of the density-dependent quark condensate decrease\nappreciably. The in-medium Gell-Mann-Oakes-Renner relation as well as other\nin-medium identities are studied in addition. Finally, several constraints on\neffective lagrangians for the description of the pion propagation in isospin\nsymmetric, isotropic and homogenous nuclear matter are discussed. (Talk\npresented at the workshop ``Hirschegg '95: Hadrons in Nuclear Matter'',\nHirschegg, Kleinwalsertal, Austria, January 16-21, 1995)\n", "  The neutrinoless double beta ($\\znbb$) decay is analyzed within the Minimal\nSupersymmetric Standard Model with explicit R-parity violation (\\rp MSSM). We\nhave found new supersymmetric contributions to this process and give the\ncomplete set of relevant Feynman diagrams. Operators describing $0^+\n\\longrightarrow 0^+$ nuclear transitions induced by the supersymmetric\ninteractions of the \\rp MSSM are derived. These operators can be used for\ncalculating the $\\znbb$ decay rate applying any specific nuclear model wave\nfunctions.\n", "  A new approach to the analysis of soft and semihard hadron processes is\nsuggested. In the frame of the Quark-Gluon String Model the interaction of\nvalence quarks and diquarks and sea quarks (antiquarks) of colliding hadrons is\ntaken into account. This one is calculated as the exchange by one\nnonpertubative gluon, i.e., the cut-off parameter in the gluonic propagator is\nincluded. This one allows us to analise the inclusive hadron spectra in hadron\ncollisions at transverse momenta up to 3-4 Gev/c.\n", "  Hard single diffractive processes are studied within the framework of the\ntriple--Pomeron approximation. Using a Pomeron structure function motivated by\nRegge--theory we obtain parton distribution functions which do not obey\nmomentum sum rule. Based on Regge-- factorization cross sections for hard\ndiffraction are calculated. Furthermore, the model is applied to hard\ndiffractive particle production in photoproduction and in $p\\bar{p}$\ninteractions.\n", "  We consider a process $K_{L e5} ( K_{L} \\rightarrow \\pi^{0} \\pi^{0} \\pi^{\\pm}\ne^{\\mp} \\nu )$ as a standard model background to the experiment $K_{L}\n\\rightarrow \\pi^{0} \\mu^{\\pm} e^{\\mp}$, which seeks for possible violation of\nlepton family number. Using the lowest order chiral lagrangian, we find that\nthe branching ratio for $K_{L} \\rightarrow \\pi^{0} \\pi^{0} \\pi^{\\pm} e^{\\mp}\n\\nu $ to be $6.2 \\times 10^{-12}$. A similar decay $K_{L} \\rightarrow \\pi^{\\mp}\n\\pi^{\\mp} \\pi^{\\pm} e^{\\pm} \\nu$ has a branching ratio, $1.7 \\times 10^{-11}$.\n", "  We discuss several general aspects of the free energy of the standard model\nat high temperatures. In particular the Clausius-Clapeyron equation is shown to\nyield a relation between the latent heat and the jump in the order parameter.\nThe free energy is calculated as function of temperature in resummed\nperturbation theory to two-loop order. A new resummation procedure is proposed\nin which the symmetric phase and the Higgs phase are treated differently. A\nquantitative description of the phase transition is achieved for Higgs masses\nbelow $\\sim 70$ GeV. The results are found to be in agreement with recent\nnumerical simulations on large lattices. The phase transition provides no\nevidence for strong non-perturbative effects in the symmetric phase.\n", "  Direct probes for the QGP must be hard enough to resolve sub-hadronic scales\n($\\ll \\la^{-1}$) and distinguish confined and deconfined media. This can be\nachieved by fast colour charges (jets) and heavy quark resonances (quarkonia).\nAfter a general survey, we study quarkonia as confinement probe and show in\nparticular that confined matter is transparent, deconfined matter opaque to\n\\J's.\n", "  We present some results on the usefulness of upgraded Tevatron, LHC proton\nproton collider and linear e+e- colliders in the TeV range to test the idea of\na strongly interacting sector as responsible for the electroweak symmetry\nbreaking. The calculations are performed within an effective lagrangian\ndescription, called the BESS model, which provides for a rather general frame\nbased on the standing point of custodial symmetry and gauge invariance, without\nspecifying any dynamical scheme.\n", "  An expression for the photon condensate in quantum electrodynamics is\npresented and generalized to deduce a simple relation between the gluon\ncondensate and the running coupling constant of quantum chromodynamics (QCD).\nAmbiguities in defining the condensates are discussed. The values of the gluon\ncondensate from some Ans\\\"{a}tze for the running coupling in the literature are\ncompared with the value determined from QCD sum rules.\n", "  In the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model baryons are either considered as\nquark-diquark-composites or the soliton configurations of the model are\ninterpreted as baryons. As a first step towards constructing a hybrid model,\nwhich possesses a dynamical interplay between both pictures, the Bethe-Salpeter\nequation for diquarks in the background of a soliton configuration is solved.\nThe presence of the soliton causes a significant reduction of the resulting\nbound state eigenenergy of the diquark. As a consequence a unit baryon number\nconfiguration may be constructed with a mass lower than the energy of the\nsoliton. An estimate of the influence of the diquark on the meson fields\nindicates a small decrease of the extension of the soliton due to diquark\ncorrelations.\n", "  In view of the recent and future electroweak precision data accumulated at\nLEP and SLC, we systematically analyze possible new physics effects that may\noccur in the leptonic sector within the context of $SU(2)_R \\times SU(2)_L\n\\times U(1)_{B-L}$ theories. It is shown that nonobservation of\nflavour-violating $Z$-boson decays, lepton universality in the decays $Z\\to\nl\\bar{l}$, and universality of lepton asymmetries at the $Z$ peak form a set of\ncomplementary observables, yielding severe constraints on the parameter space\nof these theories. Contributions of new-physics effects to $R_b=\\Gamma(Z\\to\nb\\bar{b})/\\Gamma(Z\\to \\mbox{hadrons})$ are found to give interesting mass\nrelations for the flavour-changing Higgs scalars present in these models.\n", "  We consider the Strongly-Coupled Standard Model (Abbott-Farhi model)\nincluding an isotriplet of W' vector bosons. First we calculate the corrections\nto the low-energy theory, which can be effectively summarized in terms of the\nparameters S, T and U. Then we use high- precision electroweak measurements to\nconstrain the mass and couplings of the W'. The W' couplings are restricted to\nbe unnaturally small, and we conclude that this model is no longer compelling\nas a theory of the electroweak interactions.\n", "  We report on a lattice QCD calculation of the flavor-singlet axial coupling\nconstant $g_A$ of the proton from the axial-vector current. The simulation is\ncarried out at $\\beta = 6$ on a quenched $16^3 \\times 24$ lattice. An\nextrapolation to the chiral limit shows that the connected insertion (valence\nand cloud parts) is $0.62 \\pm 0.09$, which is close to $g_A^8$. The\ndisconnected insertion (vacuum polarization from the sea quark) for the $u$ or\n$d$ quark is $- 0.12\\pm 0.01 $ and the $s$ quark also contributes $-0.12\\pm\n0.01$. The total $g_A^1$ is thus $0.25 \\pm 0.12$ which is in agreement with\nexperiments. In addition, we find $g_A^3 = 1.20 \\pm 0.11$, $g_A^8 = 0.61 \\pm\n0.13$ and $F_A/D_A = 0.60 \\pm 0.02$, also in agreement with experiments.\n", "  The latest measurements of $F_2$ at HERA allow for a {\\it combination} of\ngluon and sea quark distributions at small $x$ that is significantly different\nfrom those of existing parton sets. We perform a new global fit to\ndeep-inelastic and related data. We find a gluon distribution which is larger\nfor $x \\lapproxeq 0.01$, and smaller for $x \\sim 0.1$, and a flatter input sea\nquark distribution than those obtained in our most recent global analysis. The\nnew fit also gives $\\alpha_s(M_Z^2) = 0.114$. We study other experimental\ninformation available for the gluon including, in particular, the constraints\ncoming from fixed-target and collider prompt $\\gamma$ production data.\n", "  We calculate the complete ${\\cal O}(\\alpha_s)$ corrections to the quark decay\n$b\\to ccs$ taking full account of the quark masses, but neglecting penguin\ncontributions. For a c to the b quark mass ratio $m_c/m_b= 0.3$ and a strange\nquark mass of $0.2\\,$GeV, we find that the next-to-leading order (NLO)\ncorrections increase $\\Gamma(b\\to ccs)$ by $(32\\pm 15)\\%$ with respect to the\nleading order expression, where the uncertainty is mostly due to scale- and\nscheme-dependences. Combining this result with the known NLO and\nnon-perturbative corrections to other B meson decay channels we obtain an\nupdated value for the semileptonic branching ratio of B mesons, $B_{SL}$, of\n$(12.0\\pm 1.4)\\% $ using pole quark masses and $(11.2\\pm 1.7)\\% $ using running\n$\\overline{\\mbox{MS}}$ masses.\n", "  The inclusive transverse momentum and rapidity distributions for top quark\nproduction at the Fermilab Tevatron are presented both in order $\\alpha_s^3$ in\nQCD and using the resummation of the leading soft gluon corrections in all\norders of QCD perturbation theory. The resummed results are uniformly larger\nthan the $O(\\alpha_s^3)$ results for both distributions.\n", "  We discuss possible signatures of the $CP$-odd scalar of two-doublet models\nat the LHC. We find that the inclusive two-photon decay mode and the decay\nsequence $A^0 \\rightarrow Zh, h \\rightarrow \\gamma \\gamma$, where $h$ is a\n$CP$-even neutral scalar, can give viable signals in fairly large and\ncomplementary regions of parameter space.\n", "  I derive conservative upper bounds on the supersymmetry breaking parameter\n$m_{1/2}$ as a function of the strong coupling in the Standard Supersymmetric\nModel (SSM) using gauge coupling unification. I find that over more than $99\\%$\nof the parameter space, $\\alpha_3>0.120$ implies that $m_{1/2}$ is below\n$10\\TeV$ and $\\alpha_3>0.129$ implies that $m_{1/2}$ is below $1\\TeV$. I\nexpress the variation of these bounds over the SSM parameter space with a\nnumerical coefficient, $c$. I also find that in the SSM, a reasonable value of\n$50\\GeV<m_{1/2}<1\\TeV$ requires $\\alpha_3>0.119$ over the whole parameter\nspace. These bounds are particularly sensitive to the value of\n$\\sin^2\\theta_W=0.2317\\pm0.0005$ used in the calculation. In more realistic\nmodels, heavy thresholds and gravitational effects will modify this result.\nAlthough these effects are theoretically calculable in specific models, more\nrealistic models contain many unknown parameters in practice. I illustrate this\npoint with minimal supersymmetric $SU(5)$ where the combined constraints of\ngauge coupling unification and proton decay require $\\alpha_3>0.119$ for\n$m_{1/2}<1\\TeV$ and the upper bound on the supersymmetry breaking scale is\ngreatly relaxed.\n", "  Firstly, I give a brief summary of the current understanding of QCD below and\nnear $T_c$ (the critical temperature of the chiral transition). Some emphases\nare put on the qualitative difference between the Yukawa regime ($T \\sim 0)$\nand the Hagedorn regime ($T \\sim T_c$). Secondly, the dynamical phenomena\nassociated with the chiral transition, in particular, the spectral changes of\nhadrons in hot and/or dense medium are reviewed from the point of view of the\nQCD spectral sum rules. Confusions on the QCD sum rules at finite\ntemperature/density are also clarified and remarks on the effective lagrangian\napproaches are given. Thirdly, planned experiments to detect the spectral\nchanges in medium are summarized.\n", "  A simple quark-diquark model for nucleon and $\\Lambda$ structure is used to\ncalculate leading twist light-cone fragmentation functions for a quark to\ninclusively decay into P or $\\Lambda$. The parameters of the model are\ndetermined by fitting to the known deep-inelastic structure functions of the\nnucleon. When evolved from the initial to the final $Q^2$ scale, the calculated\nfragmentation functions are in remarkable agreement (for $z>0.4 $) with those\nextracted from partially inclusive $ep$ and $e^+ e^-$ experiments at high\nenergies. Predictions are made, using no additional parameters, for\nlongitudinally and transversely polarized quarks to fragment into p or\n$\\Lambda$.\n", "  An effective, low-energy, field theory of s-wave quarkonia, constituent heavy\nquarks, and gluons is constructed which is manifestly gauge invariant. The\ninteraction Lagrangian has the form of a twist expansion, as typically\nencountered in hard processes, and involves derivatives of arbitrary order. The\nparameters in the interaction are related with the non-relativistic wave\nfunction, and standard results for $Q\\bar{Q}$ inclusive decays and radiative\ntransitions are shown to be easily recovered. The light-cone gluon momentum\ndistribution at very small $x$ is calculated and shown to be uniquely\ndetermined by the non-relativistic wave function. The distribution has a part\nwhich goes as $x^{-1}logx$, ie. is more singular than the usually assumed $1/x$\nbehaviour. The fragmentation function for a virtual gluon to inclusively decay\ninto an $\\eta_c$ or $\\eta_b$ is also calculated. We find that the emission of\nlow momentum gluons makes this process quite sensitive to assumptions about the\nbinding of heavy quarks in quarkonia.\n", "  Astrophysics and cosmology can be used to test the standard model of particle\nphysics under conditions and over distance and time scales not accessible to\nlaboratory experiments. Most of the astrophysical observations are in good\nagreement with the standard model. In particular, primordial nucleosynthesis,\nsupernova explosions, stellar evolution and cosmic background radiations have\nbeen used to derive strong limits on physics beyond the standard model.\nHowever, the solution of some important astrophysical and cosmological problems\nmay require new physics beyond the standard model. These include the origin of\nthe initial conditions, large scale structure formation, the baryon asymmetry\nin the observed Universe, the dark matter problem, the solar neutrino problem\nand some cosmic ray puzzles. Here I review some important developments relevant\nto some of these problems, which took place most recently.\n", "  We propose a non-perturbative method for defining the higher dimensional\noperators which appear in the Heavy Quark Effective Theory (HQET), such that\ntheir matrix elements are free of renormalon singularities, and diverge at most\nlogarithmically with the ultra-violet cut-off. Matrix elements of these\noperators can be computed numerically in lattice simulations of the HQET. We\nillustrate our procedures by presenting physical definitions of the binding\nenergy ($\\lb$) and of the kinetic energy (-$\\lambda_1/2m_Q$) of the heavy quark\nin a hadron. This allows us to define a ``subtracted pole mass\", whose inverse\ncan be used as the expansion parameter in applications of the HQET.\n", "  The calculations in the temporal axial gauge (TAG) are revised and a new\nprescription is introduced to avoid the well-known TAG-singularity. With this\nprescription we use the TAG-formalism to calculate the one-loop dispersion\nequation for the longitudinal plasma oscillations in the high temperature limit\nand find the complete selfconsistency of TAG for pragmatic aims. Our result\nreproduces the earlier known dispersion equation obtained in covariant gauges\nand this equality explicitly demonstrates the gauge independence of the\ndispersion law in the high temperature limit and its reliability.\n", "  We summarize recent results on QCD corrections to various observables in\nsemileptonic $b$ quark decays. For massless leptons in the final state we\npresent effects of such corrections on triple differential distribution of\nleptons which are important in studies of polarized $b$ quark decays. Analogous\nformulas for distributions of neutrinos are applicable in decays of polarized\n$c$ quarks. In the case of decays with a $\\tau$ lepton in the final state mass\neffect of $\\tau$ has to be included. In this case we concentrate on corrections\nto the total decay width.\n", "  We explore the application and usefulness of the heavy quark symmetry to\ndescribe the weak decays of hadrons (mesons and baryons) containing two heavy\nquarks. Firstly, we address the internal dynamics of a heavy-heavy bound system\nwith the help of estimates based on potential models, showing an approximate\nspin symmetry in the preasymptotic quark mass region including charmonium,\nbottonium and $B_c$ meson states. However, no asymptotic spin symmetry should\nhold in the infinite quark mass limit in contrast to singly heavy hadrons.\nPredictions on semileptonic and two-body nonleptonic decays of $B_c$ mesons are\nshown. Furthermore, the stemming flavor and spin symmetries from the\ninteraction between the heavy and light components in hadrons (combining in a\n$\\lq\\lq$superflavor\" symmetry) permit their classification in $meson$-type\nsupermultiplets containing singly heavy mesons together with doubly heavy\nbaryons, and $baryon$-type supermultiplets containing singly heavy baryons\ntogether with some exotic doubly heavy multiquark states (diquonia). Exploiting\ntheir well-defined transformation properties under the superflavor symmetry\ngroup, we get predictions on the widths for some semileptonic and two-body\nnonleptonic decays of baryons containing both $b$ and $c$ quarks.\n", "  The electromagnetic form factors of the $\\rho$ meson are evaluated adopting a\nrelativistic constituent quark model based on the light-front formalism, and\nusing a meson wave function with the high-momentum tail generated by the\none-gluon-exchange interaction. The breakdown of the rotational covariance for\nthe one-body component of the current operator is investigated and the\nsensitivity of the ratio of the $\\rho$-meson form factors to the pion (charge)\nform factor to the spin-dependent component of the effective $q \\bar{q}$\ninteraction is illustrated.\n", "  After a general discussion on the choice of gauge, we compare the quark\npropagator in the background of one instanton in regular and singular gauge\nwith a gauge invariant propagator obtained by inserting a path-ordered gluon\nexponential. Using a gauge motivated by this analysis, we were able to obtain a\nfinite result for the quark condensate without introducing an infrared cutoff\nnor invoking some instanton model.\n", "  We derive a relation between four-fermion QED Green functions of different\ncovariant gauges which defines the gauge dependence completely. We use the\nderived gauge dependence to check the gauge invariance of atom-like bound state\ncalculations. We find that the existing QED procedure does not provide gauge\ninvariant binding energies. A way to a corrected gauge invariant procedure is\npointed out.\n", "  Exact mathematical solution of the minimization conditions of scalar the\nHiggs potential of the Finite Supersymmetric Grand Unification Theory is\nproposed and extremal field configurations are found. Types of extrema are\ninvestigated and masses of the new Higgs particles arisen after electroweak\nsymmetry breaking are derived analytically. The conditions for existing of\nphysically acceptable minimum are given. As it appears, this minimum is simple\ngeneralization of the analogous solution in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard\nModel. Phenomenological consequences are discussed briefly.\n", "  We study the possibility to employ neural networks to simulate jet clustering\nprocedures in high energy hadron-hadron collisions. We concentrate our analysis\non the Fermilab Tevatron energy and on the $k_\\bot$ algorithm. We consider both\nsupervised multilayer feed-forward network trained by the backpropagation\nalgorithm and unsupervised learning, where the neural network autonomously\norganizes the events in clusters.\n", "  It is suggested to determine the $A$ dependence of distortions of the nucleon\nstructure function $F_2(x)$ by summing the distortions over an interval ($x_1,\nx_2$). It was found from the analysis of data on deep--inelastic scattering of\nmuons and electrons from nuclei that the $A$ dependence of distortion\nmagnitudes obtained in each of three regions under study, namely shadowing,\nantishadowing and the EMC effect region, follow the same functional form, being\ndifferent in the normalizing factor only. All the available data give evidence\nfor the saturation of the distortion magnitude with rising $A$.\n", "  We propose a number of tests of factorization for the color-suppressed\nnonleptonic decay channels: $B \\to K^{(*)} \\; \\eta_c$ and $B \\to K^{(*)} \\;\n\\eta^\\prime_c$. The relevant leptonic constants and form factors are calculated\nwithin the QCD sum rules approach.\n", "  We study the implications of the triviality problem for the Higgs masses and\nother relevant parameters in the Next to Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model\n(NMSSM). By means of triviality, a new way to constrain parameters is proposed,\nand therefore we are able to derive triviality bounds on the heaviest-Higgs\nmass, the lightest-Higgs mass, the soft SUSY- breaking parameters, and the\nvacuum expectation value of the Higgs gauge singlet through a thorough\nexamination of the parameter space. The triviality upper bound on the\nlightest-Higgs mass predicted by NMSSM is indeed larger than the upper bound\npredicted by MSSM.\n", "  It is shown that the complex phase of $B^0$--$\\bar {B^0}$ mixing matrix\nelement is same as that of the standard model one up to the minor correction of\nthe order of $(m_c/m_t)^2$ or less in the SUSY standard model. This conclusion\nis valid as far as the Yukawa coupling constants are perturbative and\nrealistic, and can be available for other realistic models where generation\nmixing and CP violation are solely due to Yukawa interaction among quarks and\nHiggs doublets.\n", "  We discuss uncertainties of QCD predictions for the hadronic width of the\n$Z^0$ boson. Emphasis is put on quantitative estimates, taking into account the\ncurrent precision of experimental data.\n", "  It has been shown that the one-loop behavior of the axial anomaly, occurring\nwhen the axial current is appropriately normalized, leads to the cancellation\nof the corrections of type $C_F^N{\\bar \\alpha}_s^N,~~ (N\\geq 1) $ in the\nCrewther relation for the coefficient functions of deep-inelastic and\nannihilation processes. The arguments in favour of the overall factorization of\nthe factor $\\beta({\\bar \\alpha}_s)/ {\\bar \\alpha}_s$ in all orders of\nperturbation theory in this relation are presented.\n", "  It is shown that analyses at the electroweak scale can be significantly\naffected due to Landau pole effects in certain regions of the parameter space.\nThis phenomenon arises due to a large magnification of errors of the input\nparameters $m_t$, $\\alpha_G$ which have currently a 10 percent uncertainty in\ntheir determination. The influence of the Landau pole on the constraint that\nthe scalar SUSY spectrum be free of tachyons is also investigated.It is found\nthat this constraint is very strong and eliminates a large portion of the\nparameter space.Under the above constraint the trilinear soft SUSY breaking\nterm at the electroweak scale is found to lie in a restricted domain.\n", "  We investigate decays of the scalar bound state present in the Abbott-Farhi\nmodel. We show that decays with photons in the final state may have large\nbranching ratios. We also show that operators coupling the scalar particle to\ntwo photons or to a photon and a Z^0 are not seriously constrained by\nelectroweak data, unlike other sectors of the Abbott-Farhi model.\n", "  Non perturbative corrections to deep inelastic scattering are computed.\n", "  The weak $\\Lambda N\\to NN$ transition is studied in the valence quark model\napproach. The quark component of the two baryon system is described in the\nquark cluster model and the weak transition potential is calculated by\nevaluating the matrix elements of the $\\Delta S=1$ effective weak Hamiltonian.\nThe transition potential is applied to the decay of hypernuclei and the results\nare compared with available experimental data. The results indicate that direct\nquark process is significant and qualitatively different when compared with\nthose in conventional meson-exchange calculations. The direct quark mechanism\npredicts the violation of the $\\Delta I = 1/2$ rule for this transition.\n", "  A short overview of the current state of Chiral Perturbation Theory is given.\nThis includes a description of the basic assumptions, the usefulness of the\nexternal field method is emphasized using a simple lowest order example. Then\nat next-to-leading order the determination of the parameters is discussed. We\nalso present the status of calculations at ${\\cal O}(p^6)$. Finally I present\nthe extension into 3 directions: estimates of the free parameters, inclusion of\nnonleptonic weak and electromagnetic interactions, and inclusion of\nnon-Goldstone fields in the chiral Lagrangian. Invited Talk at the\nInternational Workshop on Nuclear \\& Particle Physics ``Chiral Dynamics in\nHadrons \\& Nuclei,'' Feb 6 $\\sim$ Feb 10, 1995, Seoul, Korea.\n", "  We give examples of minimal extensions of the simplest SU(5) SUSY-GUT in\nwhich all squarks and sleptons of a family have different tree level masses at\nthe unification scale. This phenomenon is general; it occurs when the quarks\nand leptons are the light remnants of a theory which contains extra heavy\nfamilies at the unification scale. The examples have interesting relations\nbetween Yukawa couplings: In one model the ratio of the top to bottom Yukawas\nis as large as $\\simeq 3$, partly accounting for the large $m_t /m_b$. Another\ngives $m_b/m_\\tau$ between 2/3 and 1; this relaxes the strict bounds on the top\nmass and neutrino properties that come from $b$--$\\tau$ unification. Still\nanother allows $ m_s/m_\\mu$ to be between 1/6 and 1 and evades the potentially\nproblematic GUT relation of $m_s=m_\\mu$. The final example has horizontal\nsparticle splittings in spite of the existence of horizontal symmetries.\n", "  We use the observed $SU(3)$ breaking in the mass spectrum of mesons\ncontaining a single heavy quark to place restrictions on the light quark\ncurrent masses. A crucial ingredient in this analysis is our recent\nfirst-principles calculation of the electromagnetic contribution to the\nisospin-violating mass splittings. We also pay special attention to the role of\nhigher-order corrections in chiral perturbation theory. We find that large\ncorrections are necessary for the heavy meson data to be consistent with $m_u =\n0$.\n", "  One of the great attractions of minimal super-unified supersymmetric models\nis the prediction of a massive, stable, weakly interacting particle (the\nlightest supersymmetric partner, LSP) which can have the right relic abundance\nto be a cold dark matter candidate. In this paper we investigate the identity,\nmass, and properties of the LSP after requiring gauge coupling unification,\nproper electroweak symmetry breaking, and numerous phenomenological\nconstraints. We then discuss the prospects for detecting the LSP from (1) LSP\nannihilations into positrons, anti-protons, and gamma rays in the galactic\nhalo, (2) large underground arrays to detect upward going muons arising from\nLSP capture and annihilation in the sun and earth, (3) elastic collisions on\nmatter in a table top apparatus, and (4) production of LSPs or decays into LSPs\nat high energy colliders. Our conclusions are that space annihilation\nexperiments and large underground detectors are of limited help in initially\ndetecting the LSP although perhaps they could provide confirmation of a signal\nseen in other experiments, while table top detectors have considerable\ndiscovery potential. Colliders, however, might be the best dark matter\ndetectors of all.\n", "  We take a fresh look at the limits on the number of neutrino flavors derived\nfrom big bang nucleosynthesis. In particular, recent measurements of the \\he4\nabundance enable one to estimate the primordial \\he4 mass fraction at $Y_p =\n0.232 \\pm .003(stat) \\pm .005(syst)$. For a baryon to photon ratio, $\\eta$,\nconsistent with the other light elements, this leads to a best fit for the\nnumber of neutrino flavors $N_\\nu < 3$ (the precise number depends on $\\eta$)\nindicating a very strong upper limit to $N_\\nu$. Here, we derive new upper\nlimits on $N_\\nu$, paying special attention to the fact that the best estimate\nmay lie in an unphysical region ($N_\\nu < 3$ if all three neutrino flavors are\nlight or massless; the lower bound to $N_\\nu$ may even be as low as 2, if the\nsmall window for a $\\nu_\\tau$ mass is exploited.) Our resulting upper limits\ntherefore depend on whether $N_\\nu \\ge 2$ or 3 is assumed. We also explore the\nsensitivity of our results to the adopted value of $\\eta$ and the assumed\nsystematic errors in $Y_p$.\n", "  We consider the effect of CP violating phases in the MSSM on the relic\ndensity of the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP). In particular, we find\nthat the upper limits on the LSP mass are relaxed when phases in the MSSM are\nallowed to take non-zero values when the LSP is predominantly a gaugino (bino).\nPrevious limits of $\\mb \\la 250$ GeV for $\\Omega h^2 < 0.25$ can be relaxed to\n$\\mb \\la 650$ GeV. We also consider the additional constraints imposed by the\nneutron and electron electric dipole moments induced by these phases. Though\nthere is some restriction on the phases, the bino mass may still be as large as\n$\\sim$ 350 GeV and certain phases can be arbitrarily large.\n", "  We study the implications of possible off-peak measurements in the 1995 LEP\nrun, in regard to probing physics beyond the Standard Model. To do so, we\ndetermine the accuracy with which various nonstandard couplings can be expected\nto be measured in the three different scan scenarios recently discussed by\nClarke and Wyatt. We find that each scan scenario allows greater sensitivity to\na different set of new physics couplings. Oblique parameters are best measured\nwith the longest scan, while nonstandard fermion couplings to the Z tend to be\nbetter constrained (albeit only marginally) if all of the 1995 LEP measurements\nare taken on the Z peak.\n", "  The bootstrap condition is generalized to $n$ reggeized gluons. As a result\nit is demonstrated that the intercept generated by $n$ reggeized gluons cannot\nbe lower than the one for $n=2$. Arguments are presented that in the limit\n$N_{c}\\rightarrow\\infty$ the bootstrap condition reduces the $n$ gluon chain\nwith interacting neighbours to a single BFKL pomeron. In this limit the leading\ncontribution from $n$ gluons corresponds to $n/2$ non-interacting BFKL pomerons\n(the $n/2$ pomeron cut). The sum over $n$ leads to a unitary\n$\\gamma^{\\ast}\\gamma$ amplitude of the eikonal form.\n", "  The deuteron is described as a quantum state on a ten-dimensional manifold\n$M_{10}$ of Skyrme fields of degree two, which are obtained by calculating the\nholonomy of $SU(2)$ instantons. The manifold $M_{10}$ includes both toroidal\nconfigurations of minimal energy and configurations which are approximately the\nproduct of two Skyrmions in the most attractive relative orientation. The\nquantum Hamiltonian is of the form $-\\Delta +V$, where $\\Delta$ is the\ncovariant Laplace operator on $M_{10}$ and $V$ is the potential which $M_{10}$\ninherits from the Skyrme potential energy functional. Quantum states are\ncomplex-valued functions on the double cover of $M_{10}$ satisfying certain\nconstraints. There is a unique bound state with the quantum numbers of the\ndeuteron, and its binding energy is approximately 6 MeV. Some of the deuteron's\nelectrostatic and magnetostatic properties are also calculated and compared\nwith experiment.\n", "  The intercept of the supercritical Pomeron is examined with the use of\ndifferent forms of the scattering amplitudes of the bare Pomeron. The\none-to-one correspondence between the eikonal phase and the ratio of the\nelastic and total cross section is shown. Based on new experimental data of the\nCDF Collaboration, the intercept and power of the logarithmic growth of the\nbare and total Pomeron amplitude are analyzed. It is shown that as a result of\nthe eikonalization procedure, the bare QCD Pomeron becomes compatible with\nexperiment.\n", "  Possible effects of the color screened confinement potential are\ninvestigated. Color screened linear potential with a large string tension\n$T=(0.26-0.32)GeV^2$ is suggested by a study of the $c\\bar c$ and $b\\bar b$\nspectra. The $\\psi (4160)$ and $\\psi (4415)$ are respectively assigned as the\n$\\psi (4S)$-dominated and the $\\psi (5S)$ $c\\bar c$ states. Satisfactory\nresults for the masses and leptonic widths (with QCD radiative corrections) of\n$c\\bar c$ and $b\\bar b$ states are obtained.\n", "  Form factors and decay widths for $D^{\\ast}\\rightarrow D \\gamma$ and\n$D^{\\ast}\\rightarrow D \\pi$ decays are estimated in a relativistic constituent\nquark model. Relativistic corrections due to light quarks are found to be\nsubstantial and to suppress the vector and axial vector form factors. The CLEO\nexperimental value of $R^0_{\\gamma}\\equiv \\Gamma (D^{\\ast 0}\\rightarrow D^{0}\n\\gamma)/ \\Gamma (D^{\\ast 0}\\rightarrow D^{0} \\pi^{0})=0.572\\pm 0.057\\pm 0.081$\nis used to determine the quark axial vector coupling $g_A$, which is found to\nbe $0.6-0.8$ for $m_u=(350-200) MeV$ correspondingly, as compared with the\nchiral model result $g_{A}= 0.8-0.9$. The heavy meson-pion strong coupling $g$\nis found to be $0.4-0.6$, much smaller than $g=1$ which is expected in the\nlarge $N_{C}$ and nonrelativistic limit, but consistent with some heavy hadron\nchiral theory and QCD sum rule results. The failure of nonrelativistic\ntreatment for the light quark in the heavy meson decays is also emphasized.\n", "  Within the standard model, we calculate the radiative $B\\rightarrow\nK^{\\star}\\gamma$ decay rate based on a Bethe-Salpeter description for the meson\nwave functions and the hadronic matrix elements. With a reasonable choice of\nparameters the branching ratio BR($B \\rightarrow K^{\\star}\\gamma$) is found to\nbe $(3.8-4.6)\\times 10^{-5}$, which is in agreement with the CLEO experimental\ndata. We also find with $m_{b}=5.12 GeV$ the ratio $R\\equiv {\\Gamma\n(B\\rightarrow K^{\\star}\\gamma )}/{\\Gamma (b\\rightarrow s\\gamma )}=(10-12)\\%$,\nwhich can be slightly larger if a smaller $m_{b}$ is chosen. In this approach,\nthe light degrees of freedom in mesons are treated as light constituent quarks\nwith relativistic kinematics, and the form factors in the decay amplitude are\nessentially determined by the relativistic kenematics and the overlap of wave\nfunctions of the initial and final state mesons. Due to the large recoil\nmomentum of the $K^{\\star}$ meson at the $B$ meson rest frame, the form factors\nare sensitive to the overlap integral of the meson wave functions, which are\ndetermined dynamically by a QCD-motivated inter-quark potential. Relativistic\neffects on the meson wave functions mainly due to the Breit-Fermi interactions\nare found to be significant in determining the decay rate.\n", "  We propose a string-derived model based on the gauge group $SU(5)\\times U(1)$\nwhich satisfies the stringent constraints from no-scale supergravity, allows\ngauge coupling unification at the string scale, and entails previously\nunexplored correlations among various sectors of the model. All supersymmetric\nobservables are given in terms of a single mass parameter with self-consistency\nof the model determining the rest, including $\\tan\\beta=2.2-2.3$ and\n$m_t\\approx175\\GeV$. A small non-universality of the scalar masses at the\nstring scale produces a downward shift in the right-handed slepton masses at\nthe electroweak scale, such that for $m_{1/2}\\gsim180\\GeV$ these particles\nbecome lighter than the lightest neutralino. This cutoff in the parameter space\nentails the imminent discovery of charginos at the Tevatron via trilepton\nevents ($m_{\\chi^\\pm_1}<90\\GeV$). Also, the lightest Higgs boson\n($m_h<90\\GeV$), the lightest chargino, and the right-handed sleptons\n($m_{\\tilde\\ell_R}<50\\GeV$) should be readily observable at LEPII. We also\ndiscuss the model predictions for $B(b\\to s\\gamma)$, $(g-2)_\\mu$, $R_b$, and\nthe prospects for direct neutralino dark matter detection.\n", "  We consider non-Standard Model physics effects using an effective lagrangian\nparameterization. We determine the operators whose effects are most significant\nand extract the sensitivity to the scale of new physics generated by the\nexisting data. We then consider processes containing the Higgs particle in\n$e^+e^-$ colliders as a probe for new physics effects, and demonstrate their\nusefulness in this area.\n", "  We use a quantum loop expansion to derive sum rule constraints on polarized\nphotoabsorption cross sections in the Standard Model, generalizing earlier\nresults obtained by Altarelli, Cabibbo, and Maiani. We show that the\nlogarithmic integral of the spin-dependent photoabsorption cross section\n$\\int^\\infty_{\\nu_{th}} {d\\nu\\over \\nu} \\Delta \\sigma_{\\rm Born}(\\nu) $\nvanishes for any $2 \\to 2$ Standard Model or supersymmetric process $\\gamma a\n\\to b c$ in the classical, tree-graph approximation. Here $\\nu = {p \\cdot q}/M$\nand $\\Delta \\sigma(\\nu) = \\sigma_P(\\nu)- \\sigma_A(\\nu)$ is the difference\nbetween the photoabsorption cross section for parallel and antiparallel photon\nand target helicities. Tests of the sum rule for the reactions $\\gamma e \\to W\n\\nu$ and $\\gamma \\gamma \\to W^+ W^-$ can provide new tests of the canonical\nmagnetic and quadrupole couplings of the Standard Model. We also extend the sum\nrule to certain virtual photon processes.\n", "  The most natural way to break the GUT gauge symmetry is with a Higgs field\nwhose vacuum expectation value is of order $10^{16}\\,\\mbox{GeV}$ but whose mass\nis of order $10^2$ to $10^3\\,\\mbox{GeV}$. This can lead to a cosmological\nhistory radically different from what is usually assumed to have occurred\nbetween the standard inflationary and nucleosynthesis epochs, which may solve\nthe gravitino and Polonyi/moduli problems in a natural way.\n", "  The smallness and hierarchy in fermion parameters could be the result of\nselection rules due to an Abelian horizontal symmetry broken by a small\nparameter. When applied to the lepton sector, then for a large class of models,\na number of interesting order of magnitude relations arise: with $i<j$,\n$m(\\nu_i)/m(\\nu_j)\\sim\\sin^2\\theta_{ij}$;\n$m(\\ell^-_i)/m(\\ell^-_j)\\lsim\\sin\\theta_{ij}$; $m(\\nu_i)/m(\\nu_j)\\gsim\nm^2(\\ell^-_i)/m^2(\\ell^-_j)$; $m(\\nu_e)\\lsim m(\\nu_\\mu)\\lsim m(\\nu_\\tau)$. The\nrelations between neutrino masses and mixings may become exact if the\nhorizontal symmetry together with holomorphy induce certain zero entries in the\nlepton mass matrices. A full high energy theory is likely to include scalars\nwith flavor changing couplings and heavy leptons in vector representations;\nhowever, the masses of these particles are too heavy to be directly observed in\nexperiment. Indirect evidence for the horizontal symmetry may arise from other\nsectors of the theory: non-degenerate sleptons are allowed as the symmetry\naligns lepton and slepton mass matrices; light leptoquarks are allowed as the\nsymmetry can make their couplings diagonal and chiral.\n", "  We discuss the phenomenology of models of dynamical electroweak symmetry\nbreaking which attempt to generate the observed fermion mass spectrum. After\nbriefly describing the variety of and constraints on proposed models, we\nconcentrate on the signatures of colored pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone bosons and\nresonances at existing and proposed colliders. These particles provide a\npossibly unique signature: strongly produced resonances associated with\nelectroweak symmetry breaking. (This is the subgroup report for the\n``Electroweak Symmetry Breaking and Beyond the Standard Model\" working group of\nthe DPF Long Range Planning Study. This report will appear as a chapter in\n``Electroweak Symmetry Breaking and Beyond the Standard Model\", edited by T.\nBarklow, S. Dawson, H.E. Haber, and J. Siegrist, to be published by World\nScientific.)\n", "  Recently, Hill has proposed a model in which new, potentially low-energy,\ntop-color interactions produce a top-condensate ({\\em a la}\nNambu---Jona-Lasinio) and accommodate a heavy top quark, while technicolor is\nresponsible for producing the $W$ and $Z$ masses. Here we argue that isospin\nbreaking gauge interactions, which are necessary in order to split the top and\nbottom quark masses, are likely to couple to technifermions. In this case they\nproduce a significant shift in the $W$ and $Z$ masses (i.e.~contribute to\n$\\Delta \\rho_* = \\alpha T$) if the scale of the new interactions is near 1 TeV.\nIn order to satisfy experimental constraints on $\\Delta \\rho_*$, we find that\neither the effective top quark coupling or the top-color coupling must be\nadjusted to 1\\%. Independent of the couplings of the technifermions, we show\nthat the isospin-splitting of the top and bottom quarks implies that the\ntop-color gauge bosons must have masses larger than about 1.4 TeV. Our analysis\ncan also be applied to strong extended technicolor (ETC) models that produce\nthe top-bottom splitting via isospin breaking ETC interactions.\n", "  Quarks whose left- and right-handed chiral components are both singlets with\nrespect to the SU(2) weak-isospin gauge group, offer interesting physics\npossibilities beyond the Standard Model (SM) already studied in many contexts.\nWe here address some further aspects. We first collect and update the\nconstraints from present data on their masses and mixings with conventional\nquarks. We discuss possible effects on $b\\to s\\gamma$ and $Z\\to b\\bar b$ decays\nand give fresh illustrations of CP asymmetries in $B^0$ decays differing\ndramatically from SM expectations. We analyse singlet effects in grand\nunification scenarios: $d$-type singlets are most economically introduced in\n${\\bf 5+5^*}$ multiplets of $SU(5)$, with up to three generations, preserving\ngauge coupling unification with perturbative values up to the GUT scale;\n$u$-type singlets can arise in ${\\bf 10+10^*}$ multiplets of $SU(5)$ with at\nmost one light generation. With extra matter multiplets the gauge couplings are\nbigger; we give the two-loop evolution equations including exotic multiplets\nand a possible extra $U(1)$ symmetry. Two-loop effects can become important,\nthreatening unification (modulo threshold effects), perturbativity and\nasymptotic freedom of $\\alpha_3$. In the Yukawa sector, top-quark fixed-point\nbehaviour is preserved and singlet-quark couplings have infrared fixed points\ntoo, but unification of $b$ and $\\tau$ couplings is not possible in a\nthree-generation $E_6$ model.\n", "  We study the dynamics of the chiral phase transition expected during the\nexpansion of the quark-gluon plasma produced in a high energy hadron or heavy\nion collision, using the $O(4)$ linear sigma model in the mean field\napproximation. Imposing boost invariant initial conditions at an initial proper\ntime $\\tau_0$ and starting from an approximate equilibrium configuration, we\ninvestigate the possibility of formation of disoriented chiral condensate\nduring the expansion. In order to create large domains of disoriented chiral\ncondensates low-momentum instabilities have to last for long enough periods of\ntime. Our simulations show no instabilities for an initial thermal\nconfiguration. For some of the out-of-equilibrium initial states studied, the\nfluctuation in the number of particles with low transverse momenta become large\nat late proper times.\n", "  Double $J/\\psi$ production has been observed by the NA3 collaboration in $\\pi\nN$ and $p N$ collisions with a cross section of the order of 20-30 pb. The\n$\\psi \\psi$ pairs measured in $\\pi^- $ nucleus interactions at 150 and 280\nGeV$/c$ are observed to carry an anomalously large fraction of the projectile\nmomentum in the laboratory frame, $x_{\\psi \\psi} \\geq 0.6$ at 150 GeV$/c$ and\n$\\geq 0.4$ at 280 GeV$/c$. We postulate that these forward $\\psi \\psi$ pairs\nare created by the materialization of Fock states in the projectile containing\ntwo pairs of intrinsic $c \\overline c$ quarks. We calculate the overlap of the\ncharmonium states with the $|\\overline u d c \\overline c c \\overline c \\rangle$\nFock state as described by the intrinsic charm model and find that the $\\pi^- N\n\\rightarrow \\psi \\psi$ longitudinal momentum and invariant mass distributions\nare both well reproduced. We also discuss double $J/\\psi$ production in $pN$\ninteractions and the implications for other heavy quarkonium production\nchannels in QCD.\n", "  We compute the renormalon ambiguity of the static potential, in the limit of\na large number of flavors. An extrapolation of the QED result to QCD implies\nthat the large distance behavior of the quark potential is arbitrary in\nperturbation theory, as there are an infinite number of prescriptions to\nassign. The shape of the potential at large distances is not only affected by\nthe renormalon pole closest to the origin of the Borel plane, but a resummation\nof all renormalon contributions is required. In particular, confinement can be\naccommodated, but it is not explained. At short distances there is no\nindication of a linear term in the potential.\n", "  Gravitino problem is discussed in detail. We derive an upperbound on the\nreheating temperature from the constraints of the big-bang nucleosynthesis and\nthe present mass density of the universe. Compared to previous works, we have\nimprove the following three points; (i) the gravitino production cross sections\nare calculated by taking all the relevant terms in the supergravity lagrangian\ninto account, (ii) high energy photon spectrum is obtained by solving the\nBoltzmann equations numerically, and (iii) the evolutions of the light elements\n(D, T, $^3$He, $^4$He) at the temperature lower than $\\sim$1MeV are calculated\nby using modified Kawano's computer code.\n", "  The $Z^0 \\to b\\bar b$ width, $\\Gamma_b$, is analysed in conjunction with the\ntotal and hadronic $Z^0$ widths, $\\Gamma_T$ and $\\Gamma_h$. Assuming,\ntentatively, that the present 2$\\sigma$ discrepancy in $\\Gamma_b$ will\nsubstantiate as time goes on, for large values of $m_H$ it will be sufficient\nto modify the $Z^0 b \\bar b$ vertex only. In contrast, for small values of\n$m_H$, the theoretical predictions for both the $Z^0$ width into light quarks\nand leptons as well as the $Z^0 \\to b\\bar b$ vertex will have to be modified.\n", "  We propose a new and universal approach to the hadronization problem that\nincorporates both perturbative QCD and effective field theory in their\nrespective domains of validity and that models the transition between them in\nanalogy to the finite temperature QCD phase transition. Using techniques of\nquantum kinetic theory, we formulate a real-time description in momentum and\nposition space. The approach is applied to the evolution of fragmenting $q\\bar\nq$ and $gg$ jets as the system evolves from the initial 2-jet, via parton\nmultiplication and cluster formation, to the final yield of hadrons. We\ninvestigate time scale of the transition, energy dependence, cluster size and\nmass distributions, and compare our results for particle production and\nBose-Einstein correlations with experimental data for $e^+e^-\\rightarrow\nhadrons$. An interesting possibility to extract the space-time evolution of the\nsystem from Bose enhancement measurements is suggested.\n", "  We present kinematical distributions for top quark pairs produced at the\nTevatron \\ppbar\\ Collider, as predicted within Next-to-Leading-Order QCD. We\nconsider single and double-inclusive distributions, and compare our results to\nthose obtained with the shower Monte Carlo HERWIG. We discuss the implications\nof our findings for experimental issues such as the measurement of the top\nquark mass.\n", "  The prediction of the strong coupling assuming (supersymmetric) coupling\nconstant unification is reexamined. We find, using the new electroweak data,\n$\\alpha_{s}(M_{Z}) \\approx 0.129 \\pm 0.010$. The implications of the large\n$\\alpha_{s}$ value are discussed. The role played by the $Z$ beauty width is\nstressed. It is also emphasized that high-energy (but not low-energy)\ncorrections could significantly diminish the prediction. However, unless\nhigher-dimension operators are assumed to be suppressed, at present one cannot\nplace strong constraints on the super-heavy spectrum. Non-leading electroweak\nthreshold corrections are also discussed.\n", "  The parameters $\\chi_{1,2}$, which measure nonfactorizable soft gluon\ncontributions to hadronic weak decays of mesons, are updated by extracting them\nfrom the data of $D,\\,B\\to PP,~VP$ decays ($P$: pseudoscalar meson, $V$: vector\nmeson). It is found that $\\chi_2$ ranges from $-0.36$ to $-0.60$ in the decays\nfrom $D\\to\\bar{K}\\pi$ to $D^+\\to\\phi\\pi^+,~D\\to\\bar{K}^*\\pi$, while it is of\norder 10\\% with a positive sign in $B\\to\\psi K,~D\\pi,~D^*\\pi,~D\\rho$ decays.\nTherefore, the effective parameter $a_2$ is process dependent in charm decay,\nwhereas it stays fairly stable in $B$ decay. This implies the picture that\nnonfactorizable effects become stronger when the decay particles become less\nenergetic after hadronization. As for $D,\\,B\\to VV$ decays, the presence of\nnonfactorizable terms in general prevents a possible definition of effective\n$a_1$ and $a_2$. This is reenforced by the observation of a large longitudinal\npolarization fraction in $B\\to\\psi K^*$ decay, implying $S$-wave dominated\nnonfactorizable effects. The nonfactorizable term dominated by the $S$-wave is\nalso essential for understanding the decay rate of $B^-\\to D^{*0} \\rho^-$. It\nis found that all nonfactorizable effects $A_1^{nf}/A_1^{BK^*},~A\n_1^{nf}/A_1^{B\\rho},~A_1^{nf}/A_1^{BD^*}$ ($nf$ standing for nonfactorization)\nare positive and of order 10\\%, in accordance with $\\chi_2(B\\to D(D^*)\\pi(\n\\rho))$ and $\\chi_2(B\\to\\psi K)$. However, we show that in $D\\to\\bar{K}^*\\rho$\ndecay nonfactorizable effects cannot be dominated by the $S$-wave. A\npolarization measurement in the color- and Cabibbo-suppressed decay mode\n$D^+\\to\\phi\\rho^+$ is strongly urged in order to test if $A_2^{nf}/A_2$ plays a\nmore pivotal role than $A_1^{nf}/A_1$ in charm decay.\n", "  Leptons, quarks and gauge bosons are assumed to be described by local field\ntheory. Stringent bounds on nonlocal scale can be derived from the high-\npresision LEP measurements. We find a bound on nonlocal scale $\\Lambda_{nl} >\n1020\\: Gev$, C.L.95\\% from LEP data.\n", "  We extend earlier investigations of charge symmetry violation in the valence\nquark distributions of the nucleon, and make similar estimates for the pion.\nThe sensitivity of pion-induced Drell-Yan measurements to such effects is then\nexamined. It is shown that combinations of $\\pi^+$ and $\\pi^-$ data on\ndeuterium and hydrogen are sensitive to these violations, and that the pion and\nnucleon charge symmetry violating terms separate as a function of $x_\\pi$ and\n$x_N$ respectively. We estimate the background terms which must be evaluated to\nextract charge symmetry violation.\n", "  The soft behavior of the bremsstrahlung from a source is discussed in terms\nof classical transport models and within a non--equilibrium quantum field\ntheory (Schwinger - Kadanoff - Baym - Keldysh) formulation.\n", "  In the WKB approximation the $\\nabla^2S$ term in Schrodinger's equation is\nsubordinate to the |\\nabla S|^2 term. Here we study an anti-WKB approximation\nin which the $\\nabla^2 S$ term dominates (after a guess for S is supplied). Our\napproximation produces only the nodeless ground state wavefunction, but it can\nbe used in potential problems where the potential is not symmetric, and in\nproblems where there are many degrees of freedom. As a test, we apply the\nmethod to potential problems, including the hydrogen and helium atoms and to\n$\\phi^4$ field theory.\n", "  In these lectures we discuss the Balitsky, Fadin, Kuraev, and Lipatov (BFKL)\ntheory, which resums the leading logarithmic contributions to the radiative\ncorrections to parton scattering in the high-energy limit, and we apply it to\nhadronic two-jet production at large rapidity intervals.\n", "  The presence of the $(B+L)$-conserving decay modes $n \\to K^+ e^-,$ $n \\to\nK^+ \\mu^-,$ $p \\to K^+ e^- \\pi^+$ and $p \\to K^+ \\mu^- \\pi^+$ is shown to be a\ncharacteristic feature of a class of models with explicit breaking of\n$R$-parity. These modes dominate over the $(B-L)$-conserving ones in certain\nregions of the parameter space; the impact of this scenario for nucleon decay\nsearch at the Super-Kamiokande is discussed.\n", "  We consider a class of models predicting new heavy neutral fermionic states,\nwhose mixing with the light neutrinos can be naturally significant and produce\nobservable effects below the threshold for their production. We update the\nindirect limits on the flavour non-diagonal mixing parameters that can be\nderived from unitarity, and show that significant rates are in general expected\nfor one-loop-induced rare processes due to the exchange of virtual heavy\nneutrinos, involving the violation of the muon and electron lepton numbers. In\nparticular, the amplitudes for $\\mu$--$e$ conversion in nuclei and for $\\mu\\to\nee^+e^-$ show a non-decoupling quadratic dependence on the heavy neutrino mass\n$M$, while $\\mu\\to e\\gamma$ is almost independent of the heavy scale above the\nelectroweak scale. These three processes are then used to set stringent\nconstraints on the flavour-violating mixing angles. In all the cases\nconsidered, we point out explicitly that the non-decoupling behaviour is\nstrictly related to the spontaneous breaking of the SU(2) symmetry.\n", "  We examine the possibility of bound state formation in the W_L H --> W_L H\nchannel. The dynamical calculation using the N/D method indicates that when the\ninteractions among the Goldstone and Higgs bosons become sufficiently strong, a\np-wave state [I^G(J^P)=1^-(1^+)] may emerge.\n", "  A study of correlations in tractable multiparticle cascade models in terms of\nwavelets reveals many promising features. The selfsimilar construction of the\nwavelet basis functions and their multiscale localization properties provide a\nnew approach to the statistical analysis and analytical control of\nhierarchically organized branching processes. The exact analytical solution of\nseveral discrete models shows that the wavelet transformation supresses\nredundancy in the correlation information. Wavelet correlations can be\nnaturally interpreted as correlations between structures (clumps) living on\ndifferent scales.\n", "  Within the Nambu--Jona--Lasinio model strange degrees of freedom are\nincorporated into the soliton picture using the collective approach of Yabu and\nAndo. The form factors of the nucleon associated with the nonet vector current\nare extracted. The numerical results provide limits for the strange magnetic\nmoment: $-0.05\\le\\mu_s\\le0.25$. For the strange magnetic form factor of the\nnucleon the valence quark and vacuum contributions add coherently while there\nare significant cancellations for the strange electric form factor.\n", "  We examine the potential of constraining possible nondecoupling effects of\nheavy neutrinos and Higgs bosons at LEP and SLC that may show up in the\nnonoblique part of the $Zl_il_j$ couplings. We analyze this type of new-physics\ninteractions within the context of low-energy scenarios motivated by unified\ntheories, such as the Standard Model (SM) with neutral isosinglets, the\nleft-right symmetric model, and the minimal supersymmetric SM. Our analysis\ncomprises a complete set of physical quantities based on the nonobservation of\nflavour-violating $Z$-boson decays, lepton universality in the decays $Z\\to\nl\\bar{l}$, and universality of lepton asymmetries at the $Z$ peak. It is found\nthat these quantities form a set of complementary observables and may hence\nconstrain the parameter space of the theories. Non-SM contributions of\nnew-physics interactions to $R_b=\\Gamma(Z\\to b\\bar{b})/\\Gamma(Z\\to\n\\mbox{hadrons})$ are briefly discussed within these models.\n", "  In rigid supersymmetry, generic models of dynamical supersymmetry breaking\ncontain a light Goldstone boson, called the R axion. We show that supergravity\neffects explicitly break the R symmetry and give mass to the R axion. For\nvisible and renormalizable hidden sector models, the massive R axion is free\nfrom astrophysical and cosmological problems. For nonrenormalizable hidden\nsector models, the R axion suffers from cosmological difficulties similar to\nthose of the moduli fields in string theory.\n", "  Using the S--matrix pinch technique we obtain to one loop order, gauge\nindependent $\\gamma W^-W^+$ and $Z W^-W^+$ vertices in the context of the\nstandard model, with all incoming momenta off--shell. We show that the vertices\nso constructed satisfy simple QED--like Ward identities. These gauge invariant\nvertices give rise to expressions for the magnetic dipole and electric\nquadrupole form factors of the W gauge boson, which, unlike previous\ntreatments, satisfy the crucial properties of infrared finiteness and\nperturbative unitarity.\n", "  The untwisted moduli in four-dimensional fermionic string models are\nidentified by considering world-sheet Abelian Thirring interactions. The full\nKahler potentials of untwisted sector fields are given for a restricted class\nof models.\n", "  Small neutrino masses can arise in some grand unified models or superstring\ntheories. We consider a model with an enhanced fermion sector containing Dirac\nneutral heavy leptons. The dependence on the mass and mixing parameters of\nthese new fermions is investigated for several measurable quantities. We study\nthe flavor-conserving leptonic decays of the Z boson and universality breaking\nin these decays. We also consider the W boson mass dependence on neutral heavy\nlepton parameters.\n", "  It is shown that specific spin-flavour properties of the nonperturbative\ninteraction between quarks induced by instantons allow us to explain the\npeculiarities of the OZI rule violation in $N \\bar N$ annihilation. New\nexperiments to test the instanton mechanism of the OZI rule violation are\nproposed.\n", "  We present a higher-twist production mechanism for $\\eta_c$ and $\\chi_J$\ncharmonium at large momentum fraction $x_F$ in pion-nucleon collisions. The\nhigher-twist contribution is essentially independent of $x_F$ and therefore\nbecomes dominant at large $x_F$, where the leading-twist contribution falls off\nas $(1-x_F)^3$. We show that the higher-twist mechanism produces longitudinally\npolarized $\\chi_1$ and $\\chi_2$. For the $\\chi_2$, this is clearly different\nfrom the leading-twist prediction of transverse polarization. For the $\\chi_1$,\nthe polarization of the leading- and higher-twist contributions is\nqualitatively similar.\n", "  We explore the prospect of charged Higgs boson search in top quark decay at\nthe Tevatron collider upgrade, taking advantage of the opposite states of\n$\\tau$ polarization resulting from the $H^\\pm$ and $W^\\pm$ decays. Methods of\ndistinguishing the two contributions in the inclusive 1-prong hadronic decay\nchannel of $\\tau$ are suggested. The resulting signature and discovery limit of\n$H^\\pm$ are presented for the Tevatron upgrade as well as the Tevatron$^\\star$\nand the Ditevatron options.\n", "  $\\eta \\rightarrow \\pi^{0} \\gamma \\gamma$ and $\\ggpipi$ are considered in\n$O(p^{6})$ chiral perturbation theory. In addition to the usual $\\rho,\\omega$\ncontributions, there are two $O(p^{6})$ operators (${\\cal L}_{6,m}$) arising\nfrom explicit chiral symmetry breaking. Since only one of the two operators\ncontributes to $\\etapigg$, the coefficient of this operator ($\\equiv d_3$) can\nbe determined in two ways : (i) from the measured decay rate of $\\eta\n\\rightarrow \\pi^{0} \\gamma \\gamma$, and (ii) by assuming the resonance\nsaturations of the low energy coefficients in the $O(p^{6})$ chiral lagrangian.\nWe find that two methods lead to vastly different values of $d_3$, which would\nindicate that either the measured decay rate for $\\eta \\rightarrow \\pi^{0}\n\\gamma \\gamma$ is too large by a factor of $2 \\sim 3$, or the resonance\nsaturation assumptions do not work for $d_3$.\n", "  Initial conditions for quark-gluon plasma formation at $\\tau=0.1\\fm$ are\nconsidered in lowest order perturbative QCD. Chemical composition,\nthermalization of the formed semihard quark-gluon system and especially\nimplications of the new HERA parton distributions with the enhancement at small\n$x$ are studied. The plasma at $\\tau=0.1\\fm$ is shown to be strongly gluon\ndominated both at RHIC and LHC, and a possibility for rapid thermalization of\ngluons at LHC is pointed out. Uncertainties in the calculations, particularly\nshadowing corrections to the parton distributions, are discussed. Free\nstreaming and ideal hydro limits for the evolution of the gluonic plasma with\nthe calculated minijet initial conditions are demonstrated, and a lower limit\nfor final multiplicities obtained for the LHC nuclear collisions.\n", "  It is shown that the methods which have been used up to now to determine the\n$W$ width from the $p\\bar p$ data confirm the SM predictions for some\ncombinations of various phenomenological parameters, however, they do not give\nan independent value for the $W$ width. Moreover, the accuracy that could be\nachieved in future experimental checks of SM predictions for such quantities is\nlimited by effects which require detailed theoretical study.\n", "  We discuss some applications of the effective quantum field theory to the\ndescription of the physics beyond the Standard Model. We consider two different\nexamples. In the first one we derive, at the one-loop level, an effective\nlagrangian for an extension of the Standard Model with a charged scalar singlet\nby ``integrating out'' the heavy scalar. In the second example we illustrate\nthe use of general effective theories at the loop level.\n", "  This working group report focuses on the physics potential of $\\mu^+\\mu^-$\ncolliders beyond what can be accomplished at linear $e^+e^-$ colliders and the\nLHC. Particularly interesting possibilities include (i)~$s$-channel resonance\nproduction to discover and study heavy Higgs bosons with $ZZ$ and $WW$\ncouplings that are suppressed or absent at tree-level (such as the $H$ and $A$\nHiggs bosons of supersymmetric models), (ii)~study of the strongly interacting\nelectroweak sector, where higher energies give larger signals, and\n(iii)~measurements of the masses and properties of heavy supersymmetric\nparticles.\n", "  We review techniques simplifying the analytic calculation of one-loop QCD\namplitudes with many external legs, for use in next-to-leading-order\ncorrections to multi-jet processes. Particularly useful are the constraints\nimposed by perturbative unitarity, collinear singularities and a\nsupersymmetry-inspired organization of helicity amplitudes. Certain sequences\nof one-loop helicity amplitudes with an arbitrary number of external gluons\nhave been obtained using these constraints.\n", "  We consider one-loop corrections to partial widths of the $Z$ induced by\nsupersymmetric Yukawa interactions that violate $R$-parity. The precise\nexperimental values of the leptonic $Z$ partial widths bound these Yukawa\ncouplings, with the most interesting constraints being those on couplings\ninvolving the $\\tau$, since previous constraints on them were very mild.\n", "  After a brief review on how heavy quark symmetry constraints the helicity\nfragmentation probabilities for a heavy quark hadronizes into heavy-light\nhadrons, we present a heavy quark fragmentation model to extract the value for\nthe Falk-Peskin probability $w_{3/2}$ describing the fragmentation of a heavy\nquark into a heavy-light meson whose light degrees of freedom have angular\nmomentum ${3 \\over 2}$. We point out that this probability depends on the\nlongitudinal momentum fraction $z$ of the meson and on its transverse momentum\n$p_\\bot$ relative to the jet axis. In this model, the light degrees of freedom\nprefer to have their angular momentum aligned transverse to, rather than along,\nthe jet axis. Implications for the production of excited heavy mesons, like\n$D^{**}$ and $B^{**}$, are briefly discussed.\n", "  The method of the real time perturbative calculations of nonequilibrium\naverages is generalised to the case of varying chemical potential. Calculations\nare performed in the frame of Zubarev's nonequilibrium density matrix approach.\nIn this approach perturbations of temperature and other thermodynamical\nparameters are taken into account explicitly including nonlinear terms. It\ndiffers from the Schwinger-Keldysh approach through the choice of more general\ninitial conditions for the density matrix.\n", "  We use ISAJET to perform a detailed study of the missing transverse energy\n$\\eslt$ plus multi-jet signal expected from superparticle production at the\nCERN LHC. Our analysis is performed within the framework of the minimal\nsupergravity model with gauge coupling unification and radiative electroweak\nsymmetry breaking. We delineate the region of parameter space where the $\\eslt$\nsupersymmetry signal should be observable at the LHC and compare it to the\nregions explorable via searches for sleptons and for chargino/neutralino\nproduction. We confirm that, given a data sample of 10~$\\fb^{-1}$, $m_{\\tg}\\sim\n1300$ GeV can be explored if $m_{\\tq}\\gg m_{\\tg}$, while $m_{\\tg}\\sim 2000$ GeV\ncan be probed if $m_{\\tq}\\simeq m_{\\tg}$. We further examine what information\ncan be gleaned from scrutinizing this event sample. For instance, the multi-jet\nmultiplicity yields information on whether squark production makes a\nsignificant contribution to the observed $\\eslt$ sample. Furthermore,\nreconstructing hemispheric masses may yield a measure of $m_{\\tg}$ to $\\sim\n15-25\\%$. Finally, for favourable ranges of parameters, by reconstructing\nmasses of tagged $b\\bar{b}$ jet pairs, it may be possible to detect Higgs\nbosons produced via sparticle cascade decay chains.\n", "  Recent progress in the theoretical description of inclusive heavy flavour\ndecays is reviewed. After an outline of the theoretical methods applications to\ntotal decay rates and semileptonic decay spectra are presented.\n", "  We consider mechanism for one-spin asymmetries observed in inclusive hadron\nproduction. The main role belongs to the orbital angular momentum of the\nquark-antiquark cloud in the internal structure of constituent quarks. We argue\nthat the origin of the asymmetries in pion production is a result of retaining\nof this internal angular orbital momentum by the perturbative phase of QCD\nunder transition from the non-perturbative phase. The non-perturbative hadron\nstructure is based on the results of chiral quark models. PACS number(s):\n11.30.Qc, 12.40.Pp, 13.75.Ni, 13.88.+e\n", "  We review the latest calculations of the next-to-leading $\\DSone$ effective\nHamiltonian, relevant for $K\\to \\pi\\pi$ transitions. Numerical results for the\nWilson coefficients are given for different regularization schemes. Predictions\nof $\\epse$, obtained using different approaches to evaluate the relevant\nhadronic matrix elements, are compared. Given the present value of the top\nmass, $m_t=(174\\pm 17)$ GeV, all the analyses, in spite of the large\ntheoretical uncertainties, indicate that the value of $\\epse$ is smaller than\n$1\\times 10^{-3}$.\n", "  The Standard Model Lagrangian requires the values of the fermion masses, the\nHiggs mass and three other experimentally well-measured quantities as input in\norder to become predictive. These are typically taken to be $\\alpha$, $G_\\mu$\nand $M_Z$. Using the first of these, however, introduces a hadronic\ncontribution that leads to a significant error. If a quantity could be found\nthat was measured at high energy with sufficient precision then it could be\nused to replace $\\alpha$ as input. The level of precision required for this to\nhappen is given for a number of precisely-measured observables. The $W$ boson\nmass must be measured with an error of $\\pm13$\\,MeV, $\\Gamma_Z$ to $0.7$\\,MeV\nand polarization asymmetry, $A_{LR}$, to $\\pm0.002$ that would seem to be the\nmost promising candidate. The r\\^ole of renormalized parameters in perturbative\ncalculations is reviewed and the value for the electromagnetic coupling\nconstant in the $\\overline{\\rm MS}$ renormalization scheme that is consistent\nwith all experimental data is obtained to be $\\alpha^{-1}_{\\overline{\\rm\nMS}}(M^2_Z)=128.17$.\n", "  We present a model for quark matter with a density dependent quark-quark\n(confining) potential, which allows to describe a deconfinement phase\ntransition as the system evolves from a low density assembly of bound\nstructures to a high density free Fermi gas of quarks. A proper account of the\nmany-body correlations induced by the medium is crucial in order to disentangle\nthis behaviour, which does not uniquely stem from the the naive density\ndependence of the interaction. We focus here on the effects of finite\n(non-zero) temperatures on the dynamical behaviour of the system. In particular\nwe investigate the ground state energy per particle and the pair correlation\nfunction, from which one can extract the relevant information about the quarks\nbeing confined or not; the temperature dependence of the transition density is\nalso derived.\n", "  The upper bond on the branching ratio for $b\\to s\\gamma$ decays implies a\nstringent lower bound on the mass of the pseudoscalar Higgs boson of the MSSM\nif sparticles are heavy. This leads to an upper bound on the expected event\nrate in experiments searching for heavy supersymmetric dark matter. Scenarios\nwith lighter sparticle spectrum and light pseudoscalar Higgs boson are still\npossible, but only if $\\mu < 0$, which again implies a small LSP counting rate.\n", "  The potential of seeing supersymmetry (SUSY) at the CERN Large Hadron\nCollider (LHC) was studied by looking at 3 types of signals: dilepton events\nfrom slepton pair productions, trilepton events from chargino/neutralino\nproductions and missing energy plus multi-jet events from gluino/squark\nproductions. I described my results by mapping out reachable areas in the\nsupergravity parameter space. Areas explorable at LEP II were also mapped out\nfor comparison.\n", "  We summarize the studies on the hadronic production of S- and P-wave $(\\bar\nbc)$ mesons via direct fragmentation of the bottom antiquark as well as the\nAltarelli-Parisi induced gluon fragmentation.\n", "  We perform a detailed comparison of the present LEP data with the one-loop\nstandard-model predictions. It is pointed out that for $m_t= 174$ GeV the\n``bulk'' of the data prefers a rather large value of the Higgs mass in the\nrange 500-1000 GeV, in agreement with the indications from the W mass. On the\nother hand, to accommodate a light Higgs it is crucial to include the more\nproblematic data for the $\\tau$ F-B asymmetry. We discuss further improvements\non the data taking required to obtain a firm conclusion.\n", "  In the first section, I will try to convey a sense of the variety of\nobservational inputs that tell us about the existence and the spatial\ndistribution of dark matter in the universe. In the second section, I will\nbriefly review the four main dark matter candidates, taking note of each\ncandidate's status in the world of particle physics, its production in the\nearly universe, its effect upon large scale structure formation and the means\nby which it may be detected. Section 3 concerns the energy spectrum of (cold)\ndark matter particles on earth as may be observed some day in a direct\ndetection experiment. It is a brief account of work done in collaboration with\nJ. Ipser and, more recently, with I. Tkachev and Y. Wang.\n", "  We study the scale-invariant $O(g^4)$ kernel which appears as an infra-red\ncontribution in the BFKL evolution equation and is constructed via\nmultiparticle $t$-channel unitarity. We detail the variety of Ward identity\nconstraints and infra-red cancellations that characterize its infrared\nbehaviour. We give an analytic form for the full non-forward kernel. For the\nforward kernel controlling parton evolution at small-x, we give an impact\nparameter representation, derive the eigenvalue spectrum, and demonstrate a\nholomorphic factorisation property related to conformal invariance. The results\nshow that, at next-to-leading-order, the transverse momentum infra-red region\nmay produce a strong reduction of the BFKL small-x behavior.\n", "  We calculate the velocity and thickness of a bubble wall at the electroweak\nphase transition in the Minimal Standard Model. We model the wall with\nsemiclassical equations of motion and show that friction arises from the\ndeviation of massive particle populations from thermal equilibrium. We treat\nthese with Boltzmann equations in a fluid approximation in the background of\nthe wall. Our analysis improves on the previous work by using the two loop\neffective potential, accounting for particle transport, and determining the\nwall thickness dynamically. We find that the wall is significantly thicker than\nat phase equilibrium, and that the velocity is fairly high, $v_w \\simeq 0.7c$,\nand quite weakly dependent on the Higgs mass.\n", "  The radiation pattern of relatively soft gluons in hard scattering events is\nsensitive to the underlying color structure. As an example I consider heavy\nHiggs production via weak boson fusion at the LHC. A minijet veto, which makes\nuse of the different patterns for signal and backgrounds, provides an effective\nHiggs search tool. Talk presented at the Conference on Physics {\\it Beyond the\nStandard Model IV}, Lake Tahoe, California, December 14--18, 1994.\n", "  We present a detailed calculation of the contributions of charginos, scalar\nquarks, and charged Higgs boson to the $K^+\\rightarrow \\pi^+\\nu\\overline\\nu$\\\nand $K^0_L\\rightarrow\\mu^+\\mu^-$\\ decays. We include mixings: that of charginos\nand that of the scalar partners of the left and right handed top quark. We find\nthat the box contribution to the amplitudes is much smaller than the penguin\ncontribution, which can be $\\sim$10\\% of the Standard Model contribution, even\nfor relatively large SUSY masses. The charged Higgs contribution can be as\nlarge as 25\\% of the SM contribution in the first decay and as much as 40\\% of\nthe SM contribution in the second decay.\n", "  The minimal supergravity model (SUGRA), with gauge coupling unification and\nradiative electroweak symmetry breaking, is a well-motivated paradigm for\nphysics Beyond the Standard Model. In this talk, I review the capabilities of\nvarious present and future collider experiments to make definitive tests of the\nSUGRA model, including LEP and LEP II, the Tevatron and its upgrades, and\nfinally the CERN LHC project.\n", "  After a quick review of the framework for phenomenological analyses of\nsupersymmetry, we summarize current limits on supersymmetric particle masses\nand discuss strategies for their searches at the Fermilab Tevatron and the LHC.\nWe also discuss the sense in which such searches as well as those that may be\ncarried out at LEP complement one another. Finally, we touch upon the prospects\nfor more ambitious measurements such as those of sparticle masses and\ncouplings. Such measurements could (a) help pin down model parameters, (b)\nperhaps, serve to test our ideas of physics at very high energy, and (c)\nprovide the most direct test of supersymmetry.\n", "  Supersymmetry breaking in the early universe induces scalar soft potentials\nwith curvature of order the Hubble constant. This has a dramatic effect on the\ncoherent production of scalar fields along flat directions. For the moduli\nproblem it generically gives a concrete realization of the problem by\ndetermining the field value subsequent to inflation. However it might suggest a\nsolution if the minimum of the induced potential coincides with the true\nminimum. The induced Hubble scale mass also has important implications for the\nAffleck-Dine mechanism of baryogenesis. This mechanism requires large squark or\nslepton expectation values to develop along flat directions in the early\nuniverse. This is generally not the case if the induced mass squared is\npositive, but does occur if it is negative. The resulting baryon to entropy\nratio depends mainly on the dimension of the nonrenormalizable operator in the\nsuperpotential which stabilizes the flat direction, and the reheat temperature\nafter inflation. Unlike the original scenario, it is possible to obtain an\nacceptable baryon asymmetry without subsequent entropy releases.\n", "  We investigate the impact on low energy flavour mixing phenomena of the\nrenormalisation group running of parameters in supersymmetric theories. We have\nexplicitly chosen flavour dependent supergravity couplings. The renormalisation\ngroup equations are displayed in general matrix form. We work in a scale\ndependent basis such that the hierarchy in the quark masses can be more easily\nutilised. Simple analytic solutions are provided in matrix form (for general\nboundary conditions) when only the third generation Yukawa couplings are\nretained in the renormalisation group equations. We solve the evolution\nequations of the KM matrix and the supersymmetry breaking soft terms in the\nsquark sector. We suggest a general parametrisation of the soft analytic terms,\nmore suitable for non-universal supergravity couplings. We point out that for\nflavour dependent soft terms, there are new contributions to the neutron\nelectric dipole moment. Finally, we consider a model with maximal flavour\nmixing in order to estimate the effects due to the renormalisation scale\ndependence.\n", "  Diagrammatic techniques are invented to implement QCD gauge transformations.\nThese techniques can be used to discover how gauge-dependent terms are\ncancelled among diagrams to yield gauge-invariant results in the sum. In this\nway a multiloop pinching technique can be developed to change ordinary vertices\ninto background-gauge vertices. The techniques can also be used to design new\ngauges to simplify calculations by reducing the number of gauge-dependent terms\npresent in the intermediate steps. Two examples are discussed to illustrate\nthis aspect of the applications.\n", "  Assuming the solar and atmospheric neutrino deficits to be due to neutrino\noscillations, it is shown that the 3X3 mass matrix spanning the e, mu, and tau\nneutrinos may have already revealed a seesaw mass pattern. Also, this matrix is\nthe natural reduction of a simple 5X5 seesaw mass matrix with one large scale,\nthe 4X4 reduction of which predicts that a fourth neutrino would mix with the e\nand mu neutrinos in such a way that oscillations between them may occur just\nwithin the detection capability of the LSND (Liquid Scintillator Neutrino\nDetector) experiment.\n", "  The connection between Superstring theory and the low--energy world is\nanalyzed. In particular, the soft Supersymmetry--breaking terms arising in\nSupergravity theories coming from Superstrings are computed. Several solutions\nproposed to solve the $\\mu$ problem, and the $B$ soft term associated, are\ndiscussed. The issue of gauge coupling constants unification in the context of\nSuperstrings is also discussed.\n", "  Applications of QCD sum-rule methods to the physics of nuclei are reviewed,\nwith an emphasis on calculations of baryon self-energies in infinite nuclear\nmatter. The sum-rule approach relates spectral properties of hadrons\npropagating in the finite-density medium, such as optical potentials for\nquasinucleons, to matrix elements of QCD composite operators (condensates). The\nvacuum formalism for QCD sum rules is generalized to finite density, and the\nstrategy and implementation of the approach is discussed. Predictions for\nbaryon self-energies are compared to those suggested by relativistic nuclear\nphysics phenomenology. Sum rules for vector mesons in dense nuclear matter are\nalso considered.\n", "  The cosmological model in which 20% of the dark matter is shared by two\nnearly equal mass neutrinos fits the structure of the universe on all scales.\nThis has been motivated a $\\nu_\\mu$-$\\nu_{\\tau}$ oscillation explanation of the\ndeficit of atmospheric muon neutrinos. If the observed ratio of atmospheric\n$nu_\\mu$ to $\\nu_e$ has an alternative explanation, the cosmological model can\nbe retained if the deficit of solar neutrinos is explained by\n$\\nu_e$-$\\nu_{\\tau}$ oscillation. In this case an inverted mass hierarchy is\nrequired with $m_{\\nu_{\\mu}}\\ll m_{\\nu_e} \\simeq m_{\\nu_\\tau}\\approx 2.4$ eV.\nWe show that if there exists an $L_e- L_{\\tau}$ symmetry in nature, both the\nnear mass degeneracy of \\nue\\ and \\nut\\ as well as the consistency of the above\nvalues for neutrino masses with the negative results for neutrinoless double\nbeta decay search experiments are easily understood. We show that this symmetry\nimplemented in the context of a high-scale left-right symmetric theory with the\nsee-saw mechanism can lead to a simple theoretical understanding of the desired\nform of the mass matrix.\n", "  We present results on rapidity and transverse momentum distributions of\ninclusive charm quark production in hadronic and heavy-ion collisions at RHIC\nand LHC energies, including the next-to-leading order, $O(\\alpha_s^3)$,\nradiative corrections and the nuclear shadowing effect. We determine the\nhadronic and the {\\it effective} (in-medium) K-factor for the differential and\ntotal inclusive charm cross sections. We show that these K-factors have strong\n$p_T$ dependence. We discuss how measurements of charm production at RHIC and\nLHC can provide valuable information about the gluon density in a nucleus.\n", "  We study the see-saw enhancement mechanism in presence of the right-handed\nphases of the Dirac neutrino mass matrix and the Majorana mass matrix. The\nenhancement condition given by Smirnov is modified. We point out that the\nsee-saw enhancement could be obtained due to the right-handed phases even if\nthe Majorana matrix is proportional to the unit matrix. We show a realistic\nDirac mass matrix which causes the see-saw enhancement.\n", "  We introduce an anomalous top quark coupling (right-handed current) into\nStandard Model Lagrangian. Based on this, a more complete calculation of $b \\to\ns\\gamma $ decay including leading log QCD corrections from $m_{top}$ to $M_W$\nin addition to corrections from $M_{W}$ to $m_b$ is given. The inclusive decay\nrate is found to be suppressed comparing with the case without QCD running from\n$m_t$ to $M_W$ except at the time of small values of $|f_R^{tb}|$. e.g. when\n$f_R^{tb}=-0.08$, it is only $1/10$ of the value given before. As $|f_R^{tb}|$\ngoes smaller, this contribution is an enhancement like standard model case.\n  From the newly experiment of CLEO Collaboration, strict restrictions to\nparameters of this top-bottom quark coupling are found.\n", "  The rapid increase of the e+e- --> W+W- cross section in the threshold region\nprovides a method for measuring M(W) at LEP2. The dependence of the theoretical\ncross section -- including the effects of the finite W width, Coulomb\ninteractions and initial state radiation -- on the collider energy and on the\nmass and width of the W is investigated in order to deduce the optimal collider\nenergy which maximizes the sensitivity to M(W). Statistical and systematic\nuncertainties are studied in detail. The background contribution from QCD\nfour-jet production is estimated. It is shown that by running LEP2 at a\ncollision energy of approximately 161 GeV and obtaining a luminosity of order\n100 inverse picobarns per experiment, an uncertainty on the measured value of\nM(W) of +-70 MeV should be achievable.\n", "  We discuss applications of QCD sum rules on the light-cone to the form\nfactors of the exclusive transitions $B \\rightarrow \\pi$ and $D\\rightarrow\n\\pi$, and to the $B^*B \\pi$ and $D^*D \\pi$ coupling constants. In the light of\nour results we examine the pole dominance model for these form factors. A first\nestimate is given on the nonfactorizable amplitude of the decay $ B \\ra J/\\psi\nK$.\n", "  Using the criteria of simplicity, positivity, smoothness and process-\nindependence of construction, we find a non-polynomial model for the quark\ndistribution amplitude of the nucleon that is in agreement with QCD sum-rule\nconstraints. This simpler (\"haplousterotic\") model solves some of the problems\nconnected with the longitudinal momentum dependence of the wave function,\nwhereas the k_T-dependence of the wave function, which is also important, is\nstill left undetermined. The expansion pro- perties of the model into a\npolynomial series are examined.\n", "  The electroweak phase transition is studied at finite temperature. The\neffective action is given to higher orders, including wave function correction\nfactors and the full $g^4,\\lambda^2$ effective potential. An upper bound for\nthe Higgs mass $m_{H} \\approx 70\\ GeV$ is concluded for the reliability of the\nperturbative approach. A gauge invariant treatment of the phase transition is\npresented.\n", "  The theoretical motivations, experimental searches/hints, and implications of\nneutrino mass are surveyed.\n", "  If the phase transition of $QCD$ at nonzero temperature is dominated by the\n(approximate) restoration of chiral symmetry, then the transition might be\ncharacterized using a gauged linear sigma model. Assuming that vector meson\ndominance holds, such sigma models predict that at the temperature of chiral\nrestoration, the pole mass of the thermal $\\rho$ meson is greater than that at\nzero temperature; in the chiral limit and in weak coupling this mass is $\\sim\n962 \\, MeV$. The width of the thermal $\\rho-a_1$ peak is estimated to be about\n$200 - 250 \\, MeV$.\n", "  I discuss different models which predict changes in the mass of the thermal\n$\\rho$ field. I emphasize that while the predictions are strongly model\ndependent, nevertheless substantial shifts in the thermal $\\rho$ mass are\nexpected to occur at the point of phase transition. As long as the thermal\n$\\rho$ peak does not become too broad, this should provide a striking signature\nof the existence of a phase transition. (Based upon a talk presented at Quark\nMatter '95, Monterey, CA, Jan., 1995.)\n", "  I discuss several topics in the applications of chiral symmetry at nonzero\ntemperature, including: where the rho goes, disoriented chiral condensates, and\nthe phase diagram for $QCD$ with $2+1$ flavors.

In particular, models with {\\it negatively} polarized\n$\\bar{s}s$ pairs in the proton wave function predict $D_{nn}<0$, whereas models\nwith {\\it positively} polarized gluons would predict $D_{nn}>0$.\n", "  Preliminary results from the MILC collaboration for $f_B$, $f_{B_s}$, $f_D$,\n$f_{D_s}$ and their ratios are presented. We compute in the quenched\napproximation at $\\beta=6.3$, 6.0 and 5.7 with Wilson light quarks and static\nand Wilson heavy quarks. We attempt to quantify all systematic errors other\nthan quenching, and have a first indication of the size of quenching errors.\n", "  The current status of big bang nucleosynthesis and its implications for\nphysics beyond the standard model is reviewed. In particular, limits on the\neffective number of neutrino flavors and extra Z gauge boson masses are\nupdated.\n", "  We give a unified description of tree-level multigluon amplitudes in the\nhigh-energy limit. We represent the Parke-Taylor amplitudes and the\nFadin-Kuraev-Lipatov amplitudes in terms of color configurations that are\nordered in rapidity on a two-sided plot. We show that for the helicity\nconfigurations they have in common the Parke-Taylor amplitudes and the\nFadin-Kuraev-Lipatov amplitudes coincide.\n", "  We look for the existence of stable (by strong interactions) tetraquarks,\nmesons containing two heavy antiquarks and two light quarks, specifically a\n$|{\\bar b}{\\bar b}qq\\rangle$ state. This state is viewed as two $|{\\bar\nb}q\\rangle $ particles bound by a potential due to the exchange of the four\nlight pseudoscalar and vector mesons, namely the $\\pi,\\ \\eta,\\ \\rho$ and\n$\\omega$. Couplings of these particles are obtained by the use of heavy quark\nsymmetry. We find that the $I=0,\\ J=1$ state is bound for a large range of\nparameters, while all other states are not bound (the $I=1,\\ J=0$ system may be\nbound for some parameters at the extreme range of their allowed values). We\ndiscuss the reasons why the techniques used cannot be extended to mesons\ncontaining two $c$ quarks or a $c$ and $b$ quark.\n", "  The possible role of supersymmetry in our understanding of big bang\nbaryogenesis and cosmological dark matter is explored. The discussion will be\nlimited to the out-of equilibrium decay scenario in SUSY GUTs, the decay of\nscalar condensates, and lepto-baryogenesis as a means for generating the\nobserved baryon asymmetry. Attention will also be focused on neutralino dark\nmatter.\n", "  We examine the effect of new physics on the $R_b \\equiv \\Gamma(Z\\rightarrow\n\\bar{b}b)/\\Gamma(Z\\rightarrow {\\rm hadrons})$. Conditions for large\ncontributions are derived.\n", "  The naive implementation of finite width effects in processes involving\nunstable particles can violate gauge invariance. For the example of radiative\n$W$ production and decay, $q\\bar q' \\to \\ell\\nu\\gamma$, at tree level, it is\ndemonstrated how gauge invariance is restored by including the imaginary part\nof triangle graphs in addition to resumming the imaginary contributions to the\n$W$ vacuum polarization. Monte Carlo results are presented for the Fermilab\nTevatron.\n", "  We propose a new and universal approach to the hadronization problem that\nincorporates both partonic and hadronic degrees of freedom in their respective\ndomains of relevance, and that describes the conversion between them within a\nkinetic field theory formulation in real time and full 7-dimensional phase\nspace. We construct a scale-dependent effective theory that reduces to\nperturbative QCD with its scale and chiral symmetry properties at short\nspace-time distances, but at large distances (r > 1 fm) yields symmetry\nbreaking gluon and quark condensates plus hadronic excitations. The approach is\napplied to the evolution of fragmenting qq~ and gg jet pairs as the system\nevolves from the initial 2-jet configuration, via parton showering and cluster\nformation, to the final yield of hadrons. The phenomenological implications for\ne+e- -> hadrons are investigated, such as the time scale of the transition, and\nits energy dependence, cluster size and mass distributions. We compare our\nresults for particle production and Bose-Einstein correlations with\nexperimental data, and find an interesting possibility of extracting the basic\nparameters of the space-time evolution of the system from Bose enhancement\nmeasurements.\n", "  The fluctuation determinant which determines the preexponential factor of the\ntransition rate for minimal bubbles is computed for the electroweak theory with\n$\\sin \\Theta_W = 0$. As the basic action we use the three-dimensional\nhigh-temperature action including, besides temperature dependent masses, the $T\n\\Phi^3$ one-loop contribution which makes the phase transition first order. The\nresults show that this contribution (which has then to be subtracted from the\nexact result) gives the dominant contribution to the one-loop effective action.\nThe remaining correction is of the order of, but in general larger than the\ncritical bubble action and suppresses the transition rate. The results for the\nHiggs field fluctuations are compared with those of an approximate heat kernel\ncomputation of Kripfganz et al., good agreement is found for small bubbles,\nstrong deviations for large thin-wall bubbles.\n", "  We tabulate values of the radial Schr\\\"{o}dinger wave function or its first\nnonvanishing derivative at zero quark-antiquark separation, for $c\\bar{c}$,\n$c\\bar{b}$, and $b\\bar{b}$ levels that lie below, or just above, flavor\nthreshold. These quantities are essential inputs for evaluating production\ncross sections for quarkonium states.\n", "  Baryogenesis during the electroweak phase transition is a plausible scenario\nfor for the origin of matter in the Universe. Furthermore, it has the advantage\nover other scenarios in that one can imagine that much of the physics involved\nmay be experimentally probed before long. In the past year a consensus has\ndeveloped about major mechanisms involved. In this talk I give an overview of\nthe standard picture, and discuss briefly the advances over the past year that\nsuggest electroweak baryogenesis is a robust phenomenon.\n", "  We present selected topics on heavy-light physics on the lattice in order to\nillustrate the current status of this field. In particular results concerning\n$f_B$, semileptonic decays, the decay $B \\rightarrow K^*\\gamma$ and heavy\nbaryon masses are discussed. Special emphasis is paid to the question of\nsystematic effects which stem from the lattice discretization of QCD.\n", "  We introduce a new method to treat Majorana fermions on the GRACE system\nwhich has been developed for the computation of the matrix elements for the\nprocesses of the standard model. In the standard model, we already have such\nparticles as Dirac fermions, gauge bosons and scalar bosons in the system. On\nthe other hand, in the SUSY models there are Majorana fermions. In the first\ninstance, we have constructed a system for the automatic computation of\ncross-sections for the processes of the SUSY QED. It is remarkable that our\nsystem is also applicable to another model including Majorana fermions (e.g.\nMSSM) once the definition of the model file is given.\n", "  We have constructed a system for the automatic computation of cross-sections\nfor the processes of the SUSY QED by the extension of the GRACE system\nincluding a Majorana fermion. The system has also been applied to another model\nincluding Majorana fermions, MSSM, by the definition of the model file.\n", "  We introduce a new method to treat Majorana fermions on the GRACE system\nwhich has been developed for the automatic computation of the matrix elements\nfor the processes of the standard model. In the GRACE system, we already have\nsuch particles as Dirac fermions, gauge bosons and scalar bosons within the\nstandard model. On the other hand, in the SUSY models there are Majorana\nfermions. In the first instance, we have constructed a system for the automatic\ncomputation of cross-sections for the processes of the SUSY QED. The system has\nalso been applied to another model including Majorana fermions, the minimal\nSUSY standard model (MSSM), by the re-definition of the model file.\n", "  The supersymmetric $SU(6)$ model equipped by the flavour-blind discrete gauge\nsymmetry $Z_3$ is considered. It provides simultaneous solution to the\ndoublet-triplet splitting problem, $\\mu$-problem and leads to natural\nunderstanding of fermion flavour. The Higgs doublets arise as Goldstone modes\nof the spontaneously broken {\\em accidental} global symmetry $SU(6)\\times U(6)$\nof the Higgs superpotential. Their couplings to fermions have peculiarities\nleading to the consistent picture of the quark and lepton masses and mixing,\nwithout invoking the horizontal symmetry or zero texture concepts. In\nparticular, the only particle that has direct $O(1)$ Yukawa coupling with the\nHiggs doublet is top quark. Other fermion masses arise from the higher order\noperators, with natural mass hierarchy described in terms of small ratios\n$\\eps_\\Sigma=V_\\Sigma/V_H$ and $\\eps_H=V_H/M$, where $V_H$ and $V_\\Sigma$\ncorrespondingly are the $SU(6)$ and $ SU(5)$ symmetry breaking scales, and $M$\nis a large (Planck or string) scale. The model automatically implies $b-\\tau$\nYukawa unification. Specific mass formulas are also obtained, relating the down\nquark and charged lepton masses. Neutrinos get small ($\\sim 10^{-5}\\,$eV)\nmasses which can be relevant for solving the solar neutrino problem via long\nwavelength vacuum oscillation.\n", "  We study an extension of the supersymmetric standard model with four families\nand gauged horizontal symmetry $SU(4)_H$, in which R parity automatically\nfollows as a consequence of gauge invariance and of the field content of the\nmodel. Beyond ensuring R parity conservation, the horizontal symmetry allows\nfor the dynamical generation of a hierarchical pattern of fermion masses,\nwithout the need of any ad hoc choice of small Yukawa couplings. The structure\nof the mass matrices implies that the fourth family does not mix with the other\nthree, and that the $b',t',\\tau',\\nu'$ masses are all naturally in the 100 GeV\nrange. The model has other interesting phenomenological implications. The scale\nof the horizontal symmetry breaking is constrained by cosmological and\nastrophysical arguments to be $\\sim 10^{11}$ GeV. Then the late $b'$ decays\ncould explain a magnitude of the isotropic cosmic gamma flux. In addition, a\nlower bound of a few eV is found for the mass of the $\\tau$-neutrino, which can\nthus provide a hot component for the cosmological dark matter. Due to R parity\nconservation, the lightest supersymmetric particle is stable and can provide\nthe cold component. The $\\nu_e$ and $\\nu_\\mu$ masses can naturally be in the\ncorrect ranges for a solution of the solar or atmospheric neutrino problems via\nneutrino oscillations.\n", "  We improve, using a larger set of observations including Voyager 2 Neptune\nflyby data, previous bounds on the amount of dark matter (DM) trapped in a\nspherically symmetric distribution about the sun. We bound DM by noting that\nsuch a distribution would increase the effective mass of the sun as seen by the\nouter planets and by finding the uncertainty in that effective mass for Uranus\nand Neptune in fits to the JPL Developmental Ephermeris residuals, including\noptical data and those two planets' Voyager 2 flybys. We extend our previous\nprocedure by fitting more parameters of the developmental ephemerides.\nAdditionally, we present here the values for Pioneer 10 and 11 and Voyager 1\nand 2 Jupiter ranging normal points (and incorporate these data as well). Our\nprincipal result is to limit DM in spherically symmetric distributions in orbit\nabout the sun interior to Neptune's orbit to less than an earth mass and\ninterior to Uranus' orbit to about 1/6 of an earth's mass.\n", "  I discuss how a 1 KM3 neutrino detector can be used to study $\\nu_\\tau$\noscillations at PeV energies with neutrinos from AGN's and to study neutrinos\nfrom GRB's.\n", "  Electroweak penguin operators become important when $m_t \\approx 174$ GeV. We\ndiscuss their implications for measuring CP violating phases $\\alpha$, $\\beta$\nand $\\gamma$.\n", "  In this talk I discuss CP violation in hyperon decays in Left-Right symmetric\nmodels. I show that the asymmetry in polarization in $\\Lambda \\to p\\pi^-$ can\nbe as large as $6\\times 10^{-4}$ in these models, which is an order of\nmagnitude larger than the Standard Model prediction.\n", "  We reexamine the prospects of searching for a neutral Higgs boson in the\nintermediate-mass range, using the proton- and ion-beam facilities of the LHC\nto study coherent two-photon processes. Considering realistic design\nluminosities for the different ion beams, we find that beams of light-to-medium\nsize ions like calcium will give the highest production rates. With a suitable\ntrigger and assuming a b-quark identification efficiency of $30\\%$ and a\n$b{\\bar b}$ mass resolution of 10 GeV one could expect to see a Higgs signal in\nthe $b{\\bar b}$ channel with a 3-4 $\\sigma$ statistical significance in the\nfirst phase of operation of the LHC with beams of calcium.\n", "  The perturbative pion form factor with Sudakov suppression is re-examined.\nTaking into account the multi-gluon exchange in the law $Q^2$ regions, we\nsuggest that the running coupling constant should be frozen at\n$\\alpha_s(t=\\sqrt{<{\\bf k}_{T}^{2}>})$ and $\\sqrt{<{\\bf k}_{T}^{2}>}$ is the\naverage transverse momentum which can be determined by the pionic wave\nfunction. In addition, we correct the previous calculations about the Sudakov\nsuppression factor which plays an important role in the perturbative\npredictions for the pion form factor.\n", "  We discuss how the inflation induced supersymmetry breaking affects the flat\ndirections of SUSY vacua. We show that under general assumptions all gauge\nnonsinglet fields, parameterizing flat directions (and in particular squarks\nand sleptons), get large $radiative$ masses which are related to the value of\nthe Hubble constant ($H$) and to the expectation value of the inflaton field.\nThis mass (typically $\\sim H$) is of ``non-gravitational'' origin and does not\nvanishes in the global SUSY limit. Large radiative corrections are induced by\n$F$-term (or $D$-term) density, which dominates the inflationary universe and\nstrongly breaks supersymmetry. In such theories it is difficult to treat\nsquarks and sleptons as the light fields in the inflationary period. In the\ngeneric supergravity theories all flat directions, including moduli, are\ngetting curvature of order the Hubble constant. However, for the\ngauge-nonsinglet flat directions radiative contribution to the curvature\n(induced by renormalizable gauge interactions) may be dominant.\n", "  We construct a weak coupling, many body theory to compute parton\ndistributions in large nuclei for $x\\ll A^{-1/3}$. The wee partons are highly\ncoherent, non--Abelian Weizs\\\"{a}cker--Williams fields. Radiative corrections\nto the classical results are discussed. The parton distributions for a single\nnucleus provide the initial conditions for the dynamical evolution of matter\nformed in ultrarelativistic nuclear collisions.\n", "  We re-derive and discuss two low energy theorems which relate the potential\nof a static quark-antiquark pair with the total energy and action stored in the\nflux tube between the sources. In lattice QCD these relations are known as\nMichael's sum-rules, but we give an essential correction to one of them. Then\nwe relate the low energy theorems to the virial theorem for a heavy\nquark-antiquark bound state. Finally we compare the results for the flux tube\nformation, which have been calculated in the model of the stochastic vacuum,\nwith the low energy theorems and obtain consistency. From this we conclude that\nthe model describes the non perturbative gluon dynamics of QCD at a\nrenormalization scale, where the strong coupling constant is given by $\\al_s =\n0.57$.\n", "  These lectures are the review of the main ideas and approaches to the\nstructure of the Pomeron. They are divided in three natural parts:\n  (i) the brief review of the Reggeon Calculus, which was the first attempt to\nbuild the effective theory of the strong interaction at high energy. In spite\nof the fact that this approach turns out to be inconsistent and in lectures we\nshow why, the Reggeon approach was and is the main source of the terminology\nand phenomenology for high energy ``soft\" interactions.\n  (ii) the detail description of the QCD approach to high energy interaction.\nWe try to combine the rigorous approach in perturbative QCD with more simple,\nintuitive guess based on general properties of QCD to clarify our expectations\nand predictions.\n  (iii) the outline of my personal opinion what problems will be important in\nthe future.\n  The main reason for the lectures was just the last part to agitate you to\nthink about this difficult but because of that interesting problem. The motto\nof my lectures is {\\it `` there is nothing more exciting than to solve a\ndifficult problem. Pomeron is the one.''}\n", "  It has been shown recently that the amplitude of the creation of $n$ real\nscalar particles by one virtual boson near $n$--particle threshold exhibits\nexponential behavior at $n\\sim1/\\lambda$. We extend this result to the\nprocesses of multiparticle production at threshold by two virtual bosons. We\nfind that both the tree--level amplitude and leading--$n$ loop corrections have\nthe same exponential behavior, with the common exponent for $1\\to n$ and $2\\to\nn$ processes, for various kinematics. This result strongly indicates that the\nexponent for multiparticle amplitudes is independent of the initial state and\nthat there may exist a semiclassical approach to the study of multiparticle\nproduction.\n", "  Using the method of asymptotic sum rules we estimated the size of $O(m_s\np_\\pi^4)$ and $O(m_s^2 p_\\pi^2)$ corrections to $\\pi K$ scattering amplitude in\nlarge $N_c$ limit. These corrections arise from the sixth order effective\nchiral lagrangian (EChL). Our method enables us to estimate the corresponding\nterms of the sixth order EChL in leading order of $1/N_c$ expansion in model\nindependent way. We found that the corrections numerically are suppressed in\nspite of naive expectation of 30--35\\%. Our estimation gives the value of these\ncorrections about 5--10\\% .\n", "  We suggest a simple modification of the maximal mixing scenario (with $S_3$\npermutation symmetry) for three light neutrinos. Our neutrino mass matrix has\nsmaller permutation symmetry $S_{2}$ ($\\nu_{\\mu} \\leftrightarrow \\nu_{e}$), and\nis consistent with all neutrino experiments except the $^{37}$Cl experiment.\nThe resulting mass eigenvalues for three neutrinos are $m_{1} \\approx\n(2.55-1.27) \\times 10^{-3} eV, m_{2,3} \\approx (0.71-1.43) eV$ for $\\Delta\nm_{LSND}^{2} = 0.5 - 2.0 eV^2$. Then these light neutrinos can account for\n$\\sim (2.4-4.8)% (6.2-12.4 %)$ of the dark matter for $h = 0.8 (0.5)$. Our\nmodel predicts the $\\nu_{\\mu} \\rightarrow \\nu_{\\tau}$ oscillation probability\nin the range sensitive to the future experiments such as CHORUS and NOMAD.\n", "  We calculate the finite-temperature corrections in the dilated chiral quark\nmodel using the effective potential formalism. Assuming that the dilaton limit\nis applicable at some short length scale, we interpret the results to represent\nthe behavior of hadrons in dense {\\it and} hot matter. We obtain the scaling\nlaw, $\\frac{f_{\\pi}(T)}{f_{\\pi}} = \\frac{m_Q (T)}{m_Q}\n  \\simeq \\frac{m_{\\sigma}(T)}{m_{\\sigma}}$ while we argue, using PCAC, that\npion mass does not scale within the temperature range involved in our\nLagrangian. It is found that the hadron masses and the pion decay constant drop\nfaster with temperature in the dilated chiral quark model than in the\nconventional linear sigma model that does not take into account the QCD scale\nanomaly. We attribute the difference in scaling in heat bath to the effect of\nbaryonic medium on thermal properties of the hadrons. Our finding would imply\nthat the AGS experiments (dense {\\it and} hot matter) and the RHIC experiments\n(hot and dilute matter) will ``see\" different hadron properties in the\nhadronization phase.\n", "  We study the structure of renormalons in the Heavy Quark Effective Theory, by\nexpanding the heavy quark propagator in powers of $1/m_Q$. We demonstrate that\nthe way in which renormalons appear depends on the regularisation scheme used\nto define the effective theory. In order to investigate the relation between\nultraviolet renormalons and power divergences of matrix elements of\nhigher-dimensional operators in the heavy quark expansion, we perform\ncalculations in dimensional regularisation and in three different cut-off\nregularisation schemes. In the case of the kinetic energy operator, we find\nthat the leading ultraviolet renormalon which corresponds to a quadratic\ndivergence, is absent in all but one (the lattice) regularisation scheme. The\nnature of this ``invisible renormalon'' remains unclear.\n", "  Hard scattering processes involving hadrons at small $x$ are described by a\n$k_T$-factorization formula driven by a BFKL gluon. We explore the equivalence\nof this description to a collinear-factorization approach in which the\nanomalous dimensions $\\gamma_{gg}$ and $\\gamma_{qg}/\\alpha_S$ are expressed as\npower series in $\\alpha_S \\log (1/x)$, or to be precise $\\alpha_S/\\omega$ where\n$\\omega$ is the moment index. In particular we confront the\ncollinear-factorization expansion with that extracted from the BFKL approach\nwith running coupling included.\n", "  The colour dipole multiplicity distribution is analysed for the wave function\nof a heavy onium state at small $x$. Numerical results for the average\nmultiplicity and the effect of cutoffs on its power growth are presented. Then,\nthe full multiplicity distribution is analysed: the second multiplicity moment\nis derived and the tail of the distribution is shown to behave as $\\exp(-\\log^2\nn)$. These results are confirmed by a Monte Carlo simulation which also gives\nthe fluctuations in the spatial density of dipoles.\n", "  We classify all the phenomenologically viable fermion mass matrices coming\nfrom a spontaneously broken abelian symmetry $ U(1)_X, $ with one and two\nadditional chiral fields of opposite charges $ X=\\pm 1. $ We find that the\nnon-trivial K\\\"ahler metric can fill zeroes of the fermion mass matrices up to\nphenomenologically interesting values. A general anomaly analysis shows that\nfor one additional chiral field the only way to achieve anomaly cancellation is\nby use of the Green-Schwarz mechanism. For two additional fields with $X=\\pm 1$\nand negative charge differences in the lepton sector the anomalies can however\nbe directly put to zero. This case gives a unique prediction for the ratio of\nthe two Higgs scalars of MSSM, ${\\rm tg} \\beta \\sim { m_t \\over m_b} (sin\n\\theta_c)^ 2$, where $\\theta_c$ is the Cabibbo angle.\n", "  The initial-state radiation of soft colour dipoles produced together with a\nsingle QCD Pomeron exchange (BFKL) in onium-onium scattering is calculated in\nthe framework of Mueller's approach. The resulting dipole production grows with\nincreasing energy and reveals an unexpected feature of a power-law tail at\nappreciably large transverse distances from the collision axis, this phenomenon\nbeing related to the scale-invariant structure of dipole-dipole correlations.\n", "  Calculations of the hadronic $B^{(*)}_c$-mesons production performed in the\nframework of the perturbative QCD taking into account $O(\\alpha_s^4)$ Feynmann\ndiagrams are presented. A comparison of the exact calculations with those based\non the fragmentation model of $\\bar b\\rightarrow B^{(*)}_c+X$ shows the large\ndiscrepancy between them. The exact calculations of the $B^{(*)}_c$-mesons\nproduction cross-sections as the function of $p_T$ at the energy of the FNAL\nTevatron ($\\sqrt{s}=1.8$ TeV) are given. The predicted ratio of the vector to\nthe pseudoscalar state cross-sections is about $R\\sim 3$ instead of $R\\sim 1.4$\nfor the fragmentation model.\n", "  With $\\mu\\to e\\gamma$ decay forbidden by multiplicative lepton number\nconservation, we study muonium--antimuonium transitions induced by neutral\nscalar bosons. Pseudoscalars do not induce conversion for triplet muonium,\nwhile for singlet muonium, pseudoscalar and scalar contributions add\nconstructively. This is in contrast to the usual case of doubly charged scalar\nexchange, where the conversion rate is the same for both singlet and triplet\nmuonium. Complementary to muonium conversion studies, high energy $\\mu^+e^- \\to\n\\mu^- e^+$ and $e^-e^- \\to \\mu^- \\mu^-$ collisions could reveal spectacular\nresonance peaks for the cases of neutral and doubly charged scalars,\nrespectively.\n", "  The differential cross-section for the elastic scattering of the lightest\nsupersymmetric particle (LSP) with nuclear targets is calculated in the context\nof currently fashionable supersymmetric theories (SUSY). An effective four\nfermion interaction is constructed by considering i) $Z^0$ exchange ii)s-quark\nexchange and iii) Higgs exchange. It is expressed in terms of the form factors\n$f^0_V,f^0_A, f^0_S$ (isoscalar) and $f^1_V,f^1_A$ and $f^1_S$ (isovector)\nwhich contain all the information of the underlining theory. Numerical values\nwere obtained using representative input parameters in the constrained\nparameter space of SUSY phenomenology. Both the coherent and for odd-A nuclei\nthe incoherent (spin) nuclear matrix elements were evaluated for nuclei of\nexperimental interest. The spin matrix elements tend to dominate for\n  odd nuclei but the coherent matrix elements become more important in all\nother cases. For the coherent part the Higgs contribution competes with the Z-\nand s-quark contributions. Cross-sections as high as $10^{-37} cm^2$ have been\nobtained.\n", "  It is shown that one can fit the available data on the a0(980), f0(980),\nf0(1300) and K*0(1430) mesons as a distorted 0++ qq bar nonet using very few\n(5-6) parameters and an improved version of the unitarized quark model. This\nincludes all light two-pseudoscalar thresholds, constraints from Adler zeroes,\nflavour symmetric couplings, unitarity and physically acceptable analyticity.\nThe parameters include a bare uu bar or dd bar mass, an over-all coupling\nconstant, a cutoff and a strange quark mass of 100 MeV, which is in accord with\nexpectations from the quark model.\n  It is found that in particular for the a0(980) and f0(980) the KK bar\ncomponent in the wave function is large, i.e., for a large fraction of the time\nthe qq bar state is transformed into a virtual KK bar pair. This KK bar\ncomponent, together with a similar component of eta' pi for the a0(980) , and\neta eta, eta eta' and eta' eta' components for the f0(980), causes the\nsubstantial shift to a lower mass than what is naively expected from the qq bar\ncomponent alone.\n  Mass, width and mixing parameters, including sheet and pole positions, of the\nfour resonances are given, with a detailed pedagogical discussion of their\nmeaning.\n", "  The Euclidean version of the Yang-Mills theory is studied in four dimensions.\nThe field is expressed non-linearly in terms of the basic variables. The field\nis developed inductively, adding one excitation at a time. A given excitation\nis added into the ``background field'' of the excitations already added, the\nbackground field expressed in a radially axial gauge about the point where the\nexcitation is centered. The linearization of the resultant expression for the\nfield is an expansion $$ A_\\mu(x) \\ \\cong \\ \\sum_\\alpha \\; c_\\alpha \\;\n\\psi_\\mu^\\alpha(x) $$ where $\\psi^\\alpha_\\mu(x)$ is a divergence-free wavelet\nand $c_\\alpha$ is the associated basic variable, a Lie Algebra element of the\ngauge group. One is working in a particular gauge, regularization is simply\ncutoff regularization realized by omitting wavelet excitations below a certain\nlength scale. We will prove in a later paper that only the usual\ngauge-invariant counterterms are required to renormalize perturbation theory.\n  Using related ideas, but essentially independent of the rest of paper, we\nfind an expression for the determinant of a gauged boson or fermion field in a\nfixed ``small'' external gauge field. This determinant is expressed in terms of\nexplicitly gauge invariant quantities, and again may be regularized by a cutoff\nregularization.\n  We leave to later work relating these regularizations to the usual\ndimensional regularization.\n", "  Right handed neutrinos with mass of ${\\cal O} \\; (10^{12}-10^{13})$ GeV are\nrequired to implement the see-saw mechanism and generate neutrino masses\ncapable of playing a role in structure formation.\n  Moreover models of fermion masses often relate the Yukawa couplings involving\nthese neutrinos to the up-quark Yukawa couplings. Here we study the effects of\nsuch couplings on the radiative corrections to quark masses. We find that\n$b-\\tau$ equality at $M_{GUT}$ may still give the correct $m_b/m_{\\tau}$--\nratio at low energies, but only if there is large $\\mu-\\tau$ mixing in the\ncharged leptonic sector. We propose specific mass matrix ``textures'' dictated\nby a $U(1)$ family symmetry whose structure preserves $m_b=m_{\\tau}$ at\n$M_{GUT}$. In these schemes, due to the large $\\nu_{\\mu} - \\nu_{\\tau}$ mixing,\nit is possible to give a simultaneous solution to the solar neutrino deficit\nand the atmospheric neutrino problem.\n", "  The technique of muon mean energy determination in multilayer detectors is\ndeveloped. The mean energy is measured by means of average small bursts $m$\ni.e. the number of electrons and positrons generated by muons in the detecting\nlayers of device via three basic processes --- creation of $e^+e^-$ pairs,\n$\\delta$-electrons and bremsestrahlung. The accuracy of the method is\nconsidered.\n  Key words: muon energy, multilayer detectors.\n", "  The new source of $CP$-violation in the frames of \"charge transport\"\nmechanism of electroweak baryogenesis is investigated. The consideration is\nbased on the assumption that $C$ and $CP$ need not be violated at the same\nplace, and on the fact that in the case of nonpolarized flux of fermions\nfalling nonperpendicularily on the phase-separating domain wall the transmitted\nflux will be polarized (i.e. $P$ and $CP$ are violated). Sphaleron processes\ncan convert the ($P$ and $CP$)-asymmetric state into ($C$ and $CP$)-asymmetric\none. We argue that the value of $CP$-violation in such mechanism can explain\nthe observed value of Baryon Asymmetry of the Universe even in the frames of\nthe Minimal Standard Model.\n", "  I stress the fact that a complete study of possible New Physics effects in\nthe $Z \\rightarrow b\\bar{b}$ vertex requires a combined analysis of the ratio\n$R_b= \\Gamma(Z \\rightarrow b\\bar{b})/ \\Gamma(Z \\rightarrow hadrons)$ and the\nlongitudinally polarized forward backward asymmetry, $A_b$.\n  This is illustrated with a number of models such as the two Higgs-doublet\nmodel, the MSSM, Technicolour and models with an extra $Z'$. The use of\neffective lagrangean techniques is briefly discussed.\n", "  Using quasipotential approach, we have studied exclusive semileptonic decays\nof heavy mesons with the account of relativistic effects. Due to more complete\nrelativistic description of the $s$ quark more precise expressions for\nsemileptonic form factors are obtained. Various differential distributions in\nexclusive semileptonic decays of heavy mesons are calculated. It is argued that\nconsistent account of relativistic effects and HQET motivated choice of the\nparameters of quark-antiquark potential allow to get reliable value for the\nratio $A_2(0)/A_1(0)$ in the $D\\to K^*l\\nu_l$ decay as well as the\nratio~$\\Gamma(D\\to K^*l\\nu_l)/\\Gamma(D\\to Kl\\nu_l)$. All calculated branching\nratios are in accord with available experimental data.\n", "  We propose a phenomenological three component model describing the decay\namplitude of the process $D_{s}^{+} \\ra 3\\pi$. The first component is a\nconstant background, the second one is a Breit-Wigner amplitude associated to a\nquasi two-body $f_{0}(980) \\pi^{+}$ state and the third one another\nBreit-Wigner amplitude corresponding to a possible quasi two-body $\\rho(770)\n\\pi$ state. We show that it is possible to reproduce the observed total rate\nfor $D_{s}^{+} \\ra \\pi^{+}\\pi^{+}\\pi^{-}$ as well as the two other measured\nbranching ratios for the non resonant part and the resonant $f_{0}\\pi^{+}$ one.\nImplication of the $\\rho\\pi^{+}$ state, of which an experimental limit has been\ngiven, is discussed. An upper bound in the 10 MeV range for the decay constant\n$f_{\\pi'}$ of the $\\pi(1300)$ meson is obtained .\n  Predictions are given for the $D_{s}^{+} \\ra \\pi^{0}\\pi^{0}\\pi^{+}$ rate as\nwell as for the $\\pi^{+}$ and $\\pi^{-}$ ($\\pi^{0}$ and $\\pi^{+}$) energy\ndistributions for these two decay modes $D_{s}^{+} \\ra \\pi^{+}\\pi^{+}\\pi^{-}$\n($D_{s}^{+} \\ra \\pi^{0}\\pi^{0}\\pi^{+}$) respectively.\n", "  Gauge and Yukawa (for the third family) coupling unification seem to be the\nbest predictions of the grand-unified theories (GUTs). In supersymmetric GUTs,\none also expects that the sparticle masses unify at the GUT scale (for\nsparticles embedded in the same GUT multiplet). I show under what circumstances\nGUTs do not lead to sparticle mass unification. In particular, I give examples\nof SU(5) and SO(10) SUSY GUTs in which squarks and sleptons of a family have\ndifferent tree-level masses at the unification scale. The models have\ninteresting relations between Yukawa couplings.\n  For example, I present an SO(10) GUT that allows for a large ratio of the top\nto bottom Yukawas, accounting for the large $m_t /m_b$. The splittings can also\nbe induced in the Higgs soft masses and accommodate the electroweak breaking.\n", "  Within the QCD sum-rule approach in an external field, we calculate the\nbaryon matrix element of isovector-scalar current, $H_{\\rm B}=\\langle\nB|\\overline{u}u- \\overline{d}d|B\\rangle/2M_{\\rm B}$, for octet baryons, which\nappears in the response of the correlator of baryon interpolating fields to a\nconstant isovector-scalar external field. The sum rules are obtained for a\ngeneral baryon interpolating field with an appropriate form for the\nphenomenological ansatz of the spectral density.\n  The key phenomenological input is the response of the quark condensates to\nthe external field. To first order in the quark mass difference $\\delta\nm=m_d-m_u$, the non-electromagnetic part of the baryon isospin mass splitting\nis given by the product of $\\delta m$ and $H_{\\rm B}$. Therefore, QCD sum-rule\ncalculation of $H_{\\rm B}$ leads to an estimate of the octet baryon isospin\nmass splittings. The resulting values are comparable to the experimental\nvalues; however, the sum-rule predictions for $H_{\\rm B}$ are sensitive to the\nvalues of the response of the quark condensates to the external source, which\nare not well determined.\n", "  We report the results of including resummed splitting functions in the QCD\nevolution equations at small x, and discuss the predictions that follow for the\ndeep inelastic structure functions.\n  *Contribution at XXX Rencontres de Moriond, Les Arcs, March 1995\n", "  In this talk we present the first calculation of the gluon structure function\nfor nucleus in QCD.

We show, from the violation of elastic\nunitarity, that the scale of strong interactions is well below 1 TeV even with\na Higgs mass as low as 500 GeV provided the fourth generation fermion mass is\nequal or larger than the Higgs mass. The diagonal Pade approximant method is\nthen used to unitarize the partial wave amplitudes. It is found that, for the\nfourth generation fermion masses which are comparable to or larger than the\nHiggs mass, the Landau ghosts in the I=0 and I=2 channels of the reconstructed\namplitudes move too close to the physical region to be accepted.\n", "  The results of LO {\\it Fixed point} QCD (FP-QCD) analysis of the CCFR data\nfor the nucleon structure function $~xF_3(x,Q^2)~$ are presented. The\npredictions of FP-QCD, in which $~\\alpha_{s}(Q^2)~$ tends to a nonzero coupling\nconstant $\\alpha_{0}$ as $~Q^2\\to \\infty~,$ are in good agreement with the\ndata.

The corresponding values of\n$~\\alpha_{0}~$ are also determined. Having in mind the recent QCD fits to the\nsame data we conclude that in spite of the high precision and the large\n$~(x,Q^2)~$ kinematic range of the CCFR data they cannot discriminate between\nQCD and FP-QCD predictions for $~xF_3(x,Q^2)~$.\n  PACS: 12.38.Qk; 19.90+b; 13.60 Hb\n", "  The QCD analysis of deep inelastic diffractive scattering at HERA is\nperformed assuming the dominance of the \"soft\" pomeron exchange and simple,\nphysically motivated parametrization of parton distributions in the pomeron.\n  Both the LO and NLO approximations are considered and the theoretical\npredictions concerning the quantity $R=F_L^D/F_T^D$ for diffractive structure\nfunctions are presented.\n", "  In this paper we suggest an {\\it iterative} algorithm to compute\nautomatically the scattering matrix elements of any given effective lagrangian,\n$\\Gamma$. By exploiting the relation between $\\Gamma$ and the connected Green\nfunction generator, $Z$, we provide a formula which does not require the use of\nthe Feynman graphs and it is suitable to implement a numerical routine.

However, the effective $hhZZ$ coupling is\ngenerally unsuppressed, hence the decay of Z into two light Higgs bosons plus a\nfermion-antifermion pair may have an observable branching fraction, especially\nif $h$ decays invisibly as for example in the recently proposed doublet Majoron\nmodel.\n", "  First we review the derivation of the relativistic flux tube model for a\nquark-antiquark system from Wilson area law as we have given in a preceding\npaper. Then we extend the method to the three-quark case and obtain a\nLagrangian corresponding to a star flux tube configuration.\n  A Hamiltonian can be explicitly constructed as an expansion in $1 / m^2$ or\nin the string tension $\\sigma$. In the first case it reproduces the Wilson loop\nthree-quark semirelativistic potential; in the second one, very complicated in\ngeneral, but it reproduces known string models for slowly rotating quarks.\n", "  We study the effects of friction on the scaling evolution of string networks\nin condensed matter and cosmological contexts. We derive a generalized\n`one-scale' model with the string correlation length $L$ and velocity $v$ as\ndynamical variables. In non-relativistic systems, we obtain a well-known\n$L\\propto t^{1/2}$ law, showing that loop production is important. For\nelectroweak cosmic strings, we show transient damped epoch scaling with\n$L\\propto t^{5/4}$ (or, in the matter era, $L\\propto t^{3/2}$). A low initial\ndensity implies an earlier period with $L\\propto t^{1/2}$.

A suitable framework\nfor calculating such potentials between static quarks, i.e.\\ a generalization\nof the Wilson loop will be discussed.\n  Making a connection with recent Monte Carlo lattice simulations for the\nlowest two energies of a system of two quarks and two antiquarks, the static\n$qq\\bar{q}\\bar{q}$-potential will be calculated in perturbation theory to\nfourth order.

For a\nscalar mass above $\\sim 70$ GeV, high-temperature perturbation theory cannot\ndescribe this transition reliably. This is due to the dominance of\nthree-dimensional physics at high temperatures which implies that the effective\ngauge coupling grows strong in the symmetric phase. We give an order of\nmagnitude-estimate of nonperturbative effects in reasonable agreement with\nrecent results from electroweak lattice simulations.\n  (Talk given by C. Wetterich at the 3rd Colloque Cosmologie, Paris, June 7-9,\n1995, to appear in the proceedings)\n", "  We consider supersymmetric extensions of the standard model with two pairs of\nHiggs doublets. We study the possibility of spontaneous $CP$ violation in these\nscenarios and present a model where the origin of $CP$ violation is soft, with\nall the complex phases in the Lagrangian derived from complex masses and vacuum\nexpectation values (VEVs) of the Higgs fields. The main ingredient of the model\nis an approximate global symmetry, which determines the order of magnitude of\nYukawa couplings and scalar VEVs. We assume that the terms violating this\nsymmetry are suppressed by powers of the small parameter\n$\\epsilon_{PQ}=O(m_b/m_t)$. The tree-level flavor changing interactions are\nsmall due to a combination of this global symmetry and a flavor symmetry, but\nthey can be the dominant source of $CP$ violation. All $CP$-violating effects\noccur at order $\\epsilon_{PQ}^2$ as the result of exchange of {\\it\nalmost}-decoupled extra Higgs bosons and/or through the usual mechanisms with\nan {\\it almost}-real CKM matrix. On dimensional grounds, the model gives\n$\\epsilon_K\\approx \\epsilon_{PQ}^2$ and predicts for the neutron electric\ndipole moment (and possibly also for $\\epsilon'_K$) a suppression of order\n$\\epsilon_{PQ}^2$ with respect to the values obtained in standard and minimal\nsupersymmetric scenarios. The predicted $CP$ asymmetries in $B$ decays are\ngenerically too small to be seen in the near future. The mass of the lightest\nneutral scalar, the strong $CP$ problem, and possible contributions to the $Z$\ndecay into $b$ quarks (the $R_b$ puzzle) are also briefly addressed in the\nframework of this model.\n", "  The paper contains description of the path integrals in the action-angle\nphase space. It allows to split the action and angle degrees of freedom and to\nshow that the angular quantum corrections cancel each other if the classical\nclassical trajectory is periodic. The example considered in the paper shows\nthat the quantum problem can be quasiclassical over the part (angular in the\nconsidered case) degrees of freedom.\n", "  We present a set of studies concerning the description of New Physics (NP)\neffects caracterized by a scale much higher than the electroweak scale. We show\nthat both present experimental results and several types of theretical\nconsiderations about the Standard Model (SM) and NP suggest a hierarchy among\nthe sectors in which NP manifestations should appear. We concentrate on\nresidual effects described by effective lagrangians involving bosonic and/or\nheavy quark fields. For each operator we propose an unambiguous definition of\nthe NP scale given by the energy at which unitarity is saturated. We also\nconsider the possible existence of Higher Vector Bosons.\n  We then study the tests realizable at present and future colliders. We start\nfrom the analysis of the high precision tests at Z peak, discussing separately\nthe constraints obtained from the light fermionic sector and those due to the\n$b\\bar b$ sector. We then consider the process $e^+e^-\\to f\\bar f$ at higher\nenergies (LEP2 and NLC) and we propose the \"Z peak subtracted representation\"\nwhich allows to automatically take into account Z peak constraints and to\ndescribe several types of NP effects at any other energy. Applications to\nvarious NP effects (Higher Vector Bosons, Technicolour resonances, Anomalous\nGauge Boson couplings) are given. We then concentrate on several bosonic\nprocesses, $e^+e^-\\to W^+W^-$, $HZ$, $H\\gamma$, and $\\gamma\\gamma$ collisions\nproducing boson pairs or a single Higgs. We study the sensitivities to the\nvarious operators involved in the effective lagrangian and we propose ways to\ndisentangle them. The NP scales which can be felt vary from a few TeV at LEP2\nup to 200 TeV in single H production at NLC.\n", "  To optimally utilize all the exciting cosmological data coming in we need to\nsharpen also the theoretical tools available to cosmologists. One such\nindispensible tool to understand hot big bang cosmology is finite temperature\nfield theory. We review and summarise the efforts made by us to use finite\ntemperature field theory to address issues of current interest to cosmologists.\nAn introduction to both the real time and the imaginary time formalisms is\nprovided.\n  The imaginary time formalism is illustrated by applying it to understand the\ninteresting possibilty of Late Time Phase Transitions. Recent observations of\nthe space distribution of quasars indicate a very notable peak in space density\nat a redshift of $2$ to $3$. It is pointed out that this may be the result of a\nphase transition which has a critical temperature of roughly a few meV (in the\ncosmological units, $~\\hbar = c =k = 1$), which is natural in the context of\nmassive neutrinos. In fact, the neutrino masses required for quasar production\nand those required to solve the solar neutrino problem by the MSW mechanism are\nconsistent with each other. As a bonus, the cosmological constant implied by\nthis model may also help resolve the discrepancy between the recently measured\nvalue of the Hubble Constant and the age of the universe.\n  We illustrate the real time formalism by studying one of the most important\ntime-dependent and non-equilibrium phenomena associated with phase transitions.\nThe non-equilibrium dynamics of the first stage of the reheating process, that\nis dissipation via particle production is studied in scalar field theories. We\nshow that a complete understanding of the mechanism of dissipation via particle\nproduction requires a non-perturbative resummation. We then study\n", "  We investigate the singlet $g_T^{(0)}$ and isovector $g_T^{(3)}$ tensor\ncharges of the nucleon, which are deeply related to the first moment of the\nleading twist transversity quark distribution $h_1(x)$, in the SU(2) chiral\nquark-soliton model. With rotational $O(1/N_c)$ corrections taken into account,\nwe obtain $g_T^{(0)}=0.69$ and $g_T^{(3)}=1.45$ at a low normalization point of\nseveral hundreds MeV.\n  Within the same approximation and parameters the model yields\n$g_A^{(0)}=0.36$, $g_A^{(3)}=1.21$ for axial charges and correct\noctet--decuplet mass splitting. We show how the chiral quark-soliton model\ninterpolates between the nonrelativistic quark model and the Skyrme model.\n", "  In a previous paper we study the neutrino-electron scattering in the\nframework of a left-right symmetric model (LRSM). Constraints on the LRSM\nparameters $M_{Z_{2}}$ and $\\phi$ were obtained. Based on new measurements we\npresent an update to these constraints and also include in the calculation the\nradiative corrections.\n", "  We derive the mass correction lagrangian of the heavy meson effective theory\nby using the projection operator method. The next leading order of the mass\ncorrection and the first order of the chiral expansion are given explicitely.We\nalso consider the mass correction weak lagrangian of the heavy mesons. Finally,\nwe give the $\\it{D}^{*+}\\to \\it{D}^o \\pi^{+}$ decay.\n", "  We calculate inclusive dijet production cross section in high energy hadron\ncollisions within the BFKL resummation formalism for the QCD Pomeron. We take\ninto account the Pomerons which are adjacent to the hadrons. With these\nadjacent Pomerons we define a new object - the BFKL structure function of\nhadron - which enables one to calculate the inclusive dijet production for any\nrapidity intervals. We present predictions for the dijet K-factor and azimuthal\nangle decorrelation. Estimations for some NLO BFKL corrections are also given.\n  (To appear in the Proceedings of the Workshop on Particle Theory and\nPhenomenology, the International Institute of Theoretical and Applied Physics,\nAmes, Iowa, May 1995)\n", "  Using the recent precise measurements of eta photopro- duction in proton and\ndeuteron targets, we extract the ratio of the helicity amplitudes A^n_1/2 /\nA^p_1/2, for the excitation of N^*(1535), in the effective Lagrangian approach,\nIt is fairly model-independent, free from the final-state interaction effects,\nand negative as predicted by the quark models. We stress the importance of\npolarization observables in further elucidation of the N^*(1520)\nphotoexcitation amplitudes.\n", "  Properties of the pion are studied at finite temperature with the help of the\nPCAC and the QCD sum rule. The pionic mode is treated consistently\n  with the thermal pions which consist of the ground state at finite\ntemperature. The temperature dependence of the pion decay constant is estimated\nfor $m_{q}=0$. No consistent solution is found above the critical temperature\n$T_{c} = \\sqrt{2} f_{\\pi}^{T=0} $. The QCD sum rule shows that the finite quark\n  mass makes the critical temperature move up to a temperature where the dilute\npion gas approximation is no more valid. It also suggests that the pion decay\nconstant and the continuum threshold decrease by $\\sim 15\\%$ and $\\sim 10\\%$,\nrespectively, and that the pion mass slightly ($\\sim 3\\%$) increases at\n$T=160MeV$, where the pion gas approximation seems to break down.\n", "  The functional derivative of the effective action with respect to an external\nfield is part of the equation of motion of this field if one-loop effects\ninduced by quantum fluctuations or thermal fluctuations are included when\nminimizing the action of this field. Examples occur in all field theories\ndisplaying classical solutions or - as in the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model - self\nconsistent field configurations. We describe here a numerical method for\ncomputing such functional derivatives; we use a fermion field with Yukawa\ninteraction to an external field as an example which is sufficiently simple and\nsufficiently general. We compare the computed functional derivative to\nanalytical estimates.\n", "  A mechanism is presented through which very light scalar degrees of freedom\nobeying the nonlinear sigma model equation can emerge in spontaneously broken\ngauge theories.\n  The mechanism operates in extra dimensional theories in which a) there are\nmassless gauge fields present in the theory prior to compactification, and b)\nthe extra dimensions are inhomogeneous in such a way that symmetry breaking\nHiggs fields aquire vevs only at very localised points on the manifold. These\nconditions are naturally fulfilled in orbifold compactifications of string\ntheory. Possible applications include cosmic texture, axions and family\nsymmetry.\n", "  In this work we present the results of a complete calculation of the $\\gamma\n  \\gamma\\rightarrow \\pi^0\\pi^0$ amplitude to leading order in the large $N$\napproximation ($N$ being the number of Goldstone bosons) up to order\n$m^2_{\\pi}/F^2$. The amplitude turns to be proportional to that of\n$\\pi^+\\pi^-\\rightarrow \\pi^0\\pi^0$. In spite of the fact that this\nfactorization property cannot hold in general (as it was recently pointed out\nby Morgan and Penington), it appears here since in the large $N$ limit only the\n$I=J=0$ channel contributes to the $\\gamma \\gamma\\rightarrow \\pi^0\\pi^0$\nreaction. Moreover it seems to be a reasonable approximation in\n  this case since it is possible to reproduce, as a prediction, the\nexperimental data starting from a one-parameter fit of the $\\pi\\pi$ scattering\ndata.\n", "  We review the theory of hard exclusive scattering in Quantum Chromodynamics.\n  After recalling the classical counting rules which describe the leading scale\ndependence of form factors and elastic reactions at fixed angle, the\n  pedagogical example of the pion form factor is developped in some detail in\norder to show explicitely what factorization means in the QCD framework. The\ninclusion of transverse degrees of freedom leads to the discussion of Sudakov\neffects which are crucial for protecting the calculation from dangerous\ninfrared regions. The picture generalizes to many hard reactions; a strategy to\nextract distribution amplitudes from future data is sketched. We discuss also\nthe particular case of hadron-hadron collisions where the independent\nscattering mechanism dominates asymptotically and where a different\nfactorization formula applies. We briefly present the concepts of color\ntransparency and nuclear filtering and critically discuss the few present data\non this subject.\n", "  Bound-state corrections to $J/\\psi$ production from almost real photons are\ncalculated in the colour-singlet model. A systematic, gauge-invariant, theory\n  of hard quarkonium processes is used upto $O(v^2)$, where $v$ is the relative\nvelocity of the quarks. The internal structure of the meson is characterised by\ntwo parameters, $\\epsilon_B/M$ and $\\nabla^2 \\phi(0)/M^2 \\phi(0)$, in addition\nto the usual wavefunction at the origin $\\phi(0)$. These parameters are\nconstrained to be consistent with measured leptonic decay of the $J/\\psi$ and\nhadronic and radiative decays of $\\eta_c$.\n", "  Selectrons may be produced in pairs at LEPII if their mass is less than about\n100 GeV. Preferably, they decay into the lightest neutralino plus an electron.\nIn a scenario where selectrons are observed at LEPII, we show that: (i) in a\nfirst stage where experimental errors are large, the measurement of the total\ncross section of selectron pair production, the selectron mass, and the\nlightest neutralino mass, allow us to validate or rule out the Minimal\nSupergravity Model in its simplest form, and that (ii) in a second stage where\nprecision measurements are available, the value of $\\tan\\beta$ can be\ndetermined together with the rest of the parameters that specify the Minimal\nSupergravity Model and, with them, the entire supersymmetric spectrum can be\ncalculated. We include experimental constraints from sparticle searches,\n$Z$--pole physics, stability of the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) and\nthe decay $b\\rightarrow s\\gamma$. In these scenarios, small values of\n$\\tan\\beta$ and negative values of $\\mu$ are preferred, and the lightest Higgs\nmass satisfies $m_h<110$ GeV, which makes it likely to be detected at LEPII.\n", "  If $R$-parity is broken and the photino, although unstable, does not decay\nwithin the detector, then in new semileptonic $B$-decay modes a light ($\\sim$\n2--3 GeV) photino can be produced carrying missing energy. However, the\nphotino, being massive, arranges a different kinematical configuration for the\nvisible decay products as compared to a standard semileptonic event where the\nneutrino carries the missing energy. We study the above kinematic distributions\nin an attempt to explore the above scenario.\n", "  Bayesian statistics is based on the subjective definition of probability as\n{\\it ``degree of belief''} and on Bayes' theorem, the basic tool for assigning\nprobabilities to hypotheses combining {\\it a priori} judgements and\nexperimental information. This was the original point of view of Bayes,\nBernoulli, Gauss, Laplace, etc. and contrasts with later ``conventional''\n(pseudo-)definitions of probabilities, which implicitly presuppose the concept\nof probability. These notes show that the Bayesian approach is the natural one\nfor data analysis in the most general sense, and for assigning uncertainties to\nthe results of physical measurements - while at the same time resolving\nphilosophical aspects of the problems. The approach, although little known and\nusually misunderstood among the High Energy Physics community, has become the\nstandard way of reasoning in several fields of research and has recently been\nadopted by the international metrology organizations in their recommendations\nfor assessing measurement uncertainty.\n  These notes describe a general model for treating uncertainties originating\nfrom random and systematic errors in a consistent way and include examples of\napplications of the model in High Energy Physics, e.g. ``confidence intervals''\nin different contexts, upper/lower limits, treatment of ``systematic errors'',\nhypothesis tests and unfolding.\n", "  In a weakly first order phase transition the typical scale of a subcritical\nbubble calculated in our previous papers turned out to be too small. At this\nscale quantum fluctuations may dominate and our previous classical result may\nbe altered. So we examine the critical size of a subcritical bubble where\nquantum-to-classical transition occurs through quantum decoherence. We show\nthat this critical size is almost equal to the typical scale which we\npreviously obtained.\n", "  In a recent paper [1] we have proposed a new approach for extracting the wave\nfunction of the $\\pi$-meson $\\varphi_{\\pi}(x)$ and the masses and\n  wave functions of its first resonances from the new QCD sum rules for\nnon-diagonal correlators obtained in [2]. Here, we test our approach using an\nexactly solvable toy model as an illustrating example. We demonstrate the\nvalidity of the method and suggest a pure algebraic procedure for extracting\nthe masses and wave functions relating to the case under investigation. We also\nexplore the stability of the procedure under perturbations of the theoretical\npart of the sum rule. In application to the pion case, this results not only in\nthe mass and wave function of the first resonance ($\\pi'$), but also in the\nestimation of $\\pi''$-mass.\n", "  The physics of supersymmetry is reviewed from the perspective of physics at\never increasing energies. Starting from the minimal supersymmetric extension of\nthe Standard Model at the electroweak scale, we proceed to higher energies\nseeking to understand the origin of the many model parameters.

Conclusions\n", "  The cross section for the reactions of the type $\\mu^-\\mu^+ \\to e\\bar\\nu_e X$\ncan not be calculated by the standard methods due to the $t$--channel\nsingularity in the physical region. In this letter we show that accounting for\nthe finite sizes of the colliding beams results in the regularization of this\nsingularity. The finite cross section, which is obtained in this way, turns out\nto be linear proportional to the transverse sizes of the colliding beams. As an\napplication of the above result, we calculate the cross section of the $W$\nboson production at $\\mu^+\\mu^-$ colliders in the reaction $\\mu^- \\mu^+ \\to\ne\\bar\\nu _e W^+$.\n", "  We examine the phenomenological implications of light $\\tilde{t}_R$ and\nhiggsinos in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model, assuming $\\tan^2 \\beta\n< m_t / m_b$ and heavy $\\tilde{t}_L$ and gauginos.

This is within\nthe expected measurement uncertainty of $40\\times 10^{-11}$ in the forthcoming\nexperiment at Brookhaven National Laboratory. Our result removes one of the\nmain theoretical obstacles in verifying the existence of the weak contribution\nto the muon $g-2$.\n", "  We present some generic arguments demonstrating that an effective Lagrangian\n$L_{eff}$ which, by definition, contains operators $O^n$ of arbitrary\ndimensionality in general is not convergent, but rather an asymptotic series.\nIt means that the behavior of the far distant terms has a specific factorial\ndependence $L_{eff}\\sim \\sum_n \\frac{c_n O^n}{M^{n}},~c_n\\sim n! ,~n\\gg1$. We\ndiscuss a few apparently different problems, which however have something in\ncommon-- the aforementioned $n!-$ behavior:\n  1.Effective long -distance theory describing the collective fields in QCD;\n  2.Effective Berry phase potential which is obtained by integrating over the\nfast degrees of freedom. As is known, the Berry potential is associated with\ninduced local gauge symmetry and might be relevant for the compactification\nproblem at the Planck scale.\n  3.Nonlocal Lagrangians introduced by Georgi\\cite{Georgi} for appropriate\ntreatment of the effective field theories without power expanding.\n  4.The so-called improved action in lattice field theory where the new, higher\ndimensional operators have been introduced into the theory in order to reduce\nthe lattice artifacts.\n  5.Cosmological constant problem and vacuum expectation values in gravity. We\ndiscuss some applications of this, seemingly pure academic phenomenon, to\nvarious physical problems with typical energies from $1 GeV$ to the Plank\nscale.\n", "  Within the supersymmetric SO(10) GUT we explore the possibility of the light\nHiggs doublet being a member of the 16-dimensional spinorial representation.\nThis fact is ultimately related with the assumption that the light matter (at\nleast partially) resides in some of the tensor representations as well. Several\ninteresting features emerge. First, provided that the same 16-plet is\nresponsible for the breaking $SO(10) \\rightarrow SU(5)$, the heaviness of the\ntop can automatically follow from the field content at $M_{GUT}$, without need\nof any flavour symmetries. Secondly, the doublet--triplet splitting problem\nreceives a new natural solution. In addition, a dimension=5 (Higgsino mediated)\nproton decay can be naturally suppressed. We construct explicit SO(10) models\nwith the above properties, with most general superpotentials under the\nsymmetries.\n", "  The systematic errors inherent in the QCD sum rule approach to meson\nwavefunctions are examined in the context of QCD in 1+1 spacetime dimensions in\nthe large N limit where the theory is exactly solvable. It is shown that the\ntruncation of high momentum modes induced in a lattice discretization\nautomatically produces a Chernyak-Zhitnitsky \\cite{CZ} type meson wavefunction.\nSuch a truncation alters the balance of leading and higher twist terms in\ncorrelators. We find that the reliable extraction of (a few) higher moments is\npossible provided a reasonably accurate uniform approximation to the Euclidean\ncorrelator over a suitable $Q^2$ range is available, but that the extracted\nvalues are particularly sensitive to the balance of lower and higher twist\ncontributions. Underestimates of lower twist contributions or overestimates of\nthe highest twist term may lead to too high values for the second and fourth\nmoments of the pion wavefunction, suggesting a doubly peaked structure of the\nChernyak-Zhitnitsky type.\n", "  We analyse the possible existence of non-perturbative contributions in heavy\n$\\bar Q Q$ systems ($\\bar Q$ and $Q$ need not have the same flavour) which\ncannot be expressed in terms of local condensates. Starting from QCD, with well\ndefined approximations and splitting properly the fields into large and small\nmomentum components, we derive an effective lagrangian where hard gluons (in\nthe non-relativistic aproximation) have been integrated out. The large momentum\ncontributions (which are dominant) are calculated using Coulomb type states.\nBesides the usual condensate corrections, we see the possibility of new\nnon-perturbative contributions. We parametrize them in terms of two low\nmomentum correlators with Coulomb bound state energy insertions $E_n$. We\nrealize that the Heavy Quark Effective lagrangian can be used in these\ncorrelators.\n  We calculate the corrections that they give rise to in the decay constant,\nthe bound state energy and the matrix elements of bilinear currents at zero\nrecoil. We study the cut-off dependence of the new contributions and we see\nthat it matches perfectly with that of the large momentum contributions.\n  We consider two situations in detail: i) $E_n>> \\Lambda_{QCD}$ ($M_Q\n\\rightarrow \\infty$) and ii) $E_n << \\Lambda_{QCD}$, and briefly discuss the\nexpected size of the new contributions in $\\Upsilon$ , $J/\\Psi$ and\n$B_{c}^{\\ast}$ systems.\n", "  We investigate the effects of random density fluctuations on neutrino\noscillations in the Sun environment. We show how the average of certain\nquantities which can be used to describe the MSW effect can be computed\nanalytically. We examine also the hypothesis commonly accepted that only\nperturbations inside the resonance layer can have relevance. The average\namplitud, which gives the ''coherent probability'', is computed in an\nanalytical and exact way for the case of colored $\\delta$-correlated gaussian\nnoise: the random perturbation induces a renormalization of the matter density\nwhich adquires an imaginary part proportional to the fluctuation amplitud at\nthe resonance region. Integral equations are given for the density matrix of\nthe system in the ''optical'' approximation.\n  PACS: 96.60.Kx, 02.50.Ey, 14.60.Pq,95.30.Cq, 96.60.Hv,14.60.Gh.\n", "  The effects of resonances and flow on the correlation function for two\nidentical particles are described assuming chaotic sources and classical\npropagation of particles. Expanding to second order in relative momenta, the\nsource sizes can be calculated directly and understood as contributions from\nvarious fluctuations in the source. Specific calculations of source size radii\nare given assuming Bjorken longitudinal flow with additional transverse\nexpansion. Results are compared to recent $\\pi\\pi$ and $KK$ correlation data\nfrom relativistic nuclear collisions with particular attention to the reduction\nin the $\\pi\\pi$ correlation function due to resonances and the decreasing\nsource sizes with increasing transverse momenta of the particles.\n", "  In the presence of fermionic matter the topologically distinct vacua of the\nstandard model are metastable and can decay by tunneling through the sphaleron\nbarrier. This process annihilates one fermion per doublet due to the anomalous\nnon-conservation of baryon and lepton currents and is accompanied by a\nproduction of gauge and Higgs bosons. We present a numerical method to obtain\nlocal bounce solutions which minimize the Euclidean action in the space of all\nconfigurations connecting two adjacent topological sectors. These solutions\ndetermine the decay rate and the configuration of the fields after the\ntunneling. We also follow the real time evolution of this configuration and\nanalyze the spectrum of the created bosons. If the matter density exceeds some\ncritical value, the exponentially suppressed tunneling triggers off an\navalanche producing an enormous amount of bosons.\n", "  We develop a rather simple, formally covariant quark-diquark model of the\nnucleon. The nucleon is treated as a bound state of a constituent quark and a\ndiquark interacting via a quark exchange. We include both scalar and\naxial-vector diquarks. The underlying Bethe-Salpeter equation is transformed\ninto a pair of coupled Salpeter equations. The electromagnetic form factors of\nthe nucleon are calculated in the Mandelstam formalism. We obtain a very good\ndescription of all electromagnetic form factors for momentum transfers up to -3\n(GeV/c)^2.\n", "  We analyse the stability lower bounds on the Standard Model Higgs mass by\ncarefully controlling the scale independence of the effective potential. We\ninclude resummed leading and next-to-leading-log corrections, and physical pole\nmasses for the Higgs boson, M_H, and the top-quark, M_t. Particular attention\nis devoted to the cases where the scale of new physics \\Lambda is within LHC\nreach, i.e. \\Lambda\\leq 10 TeV, which have been the object of recent\ncontroversial results. We clarify the origin of discrepancies and confirm our\nearlier results within the error of our previous estimate. In particular for\n\\Lambda=1 TeV we find that\n  M_H[GeV]>52+0.64(M_t[GeV]-175)-0.50\\frac{\\alpha_s(M_Z)-0.118}{0.006}.\n  For fixed values of M_t and \\alpha_s(M_Z), the error from higher effects, as\nthe lack of exact scale invariance of the effective potential and higher-order\nradiative corrections, is conservatively estimated to be \\simlt 5 GeV.\n", "  We discuss a new mechanism which can solve the crisis in standard big-bang\nnucleosynthesis. A long-lived particle $X$ ($10^4 sec \\lesssim \\tau_X \\lesssim\n10^6 sec$) which decays into photon(s) will induce cascade photons, and destroy\nsignificant amounts of D and $^3$He without destroying $^4$He or too much\n$^7$Li. We numerically investigate this process and derive a constraint on the\nproperties of $X$ such that the theoretical values of the primordial\nlight-element abundances agree with observation. We also present some\ncandidates for the unstable particle $X$.\n", "  The behavior of the $\\bpi$ form factors in the entire physical range is\nexamined in a model independent way. Unitarity bounds are further constrained\nby the lattice results (APE). From this analysis, we obtain $f^{+}(0) = 0.38\n\\pm .03$ if the $B^{*}$-pole dominance behavior is assumed. However, to get the\ninformation on the behavior of the form factor $f^{+}$, QSR results are\nincluded. We see the deviations from the pole dominance due to the\ncontributions of the higher singularities which are to be treated\n  with more precise lattice data.\n", "  The generator QEDPS, a parton shower model in QED, developed by the present\nauthors has been improved. By a careful study on the shower algorithm it was\nfound that some finite contributions have been missed in the original version.\nThey are small, but cannot be neglected when the contribution of the soft\nphotons is dominant. A method is presented to correct these finite pieces and\nthen a new generator, improved QEDPS, is proposed, which is able to make more\nprecise prediction for the processes observed in e+e- annihilation as far as\nthe initial radiation is concerned.\n", "  The EMC effect is studied in the perturbative QCD hard pomeron approach. In\nthe limit $x\\rightarrow 0$ and for a nucleus with a constant density the effect\nis found to be a function of a single variable which combines its $x$-, $Q$-\nand $A$-dependence. At large $Q^{2}$ the effect dies out as $\\ln Q/Q$. At small\nbut finite $x$ a change in the anomalous dimension leads to a weaker\n$Q$-dependence, which almost disappears as $x$ grows and the anomalous\ndimension becomes small. In this approach the nuclear structure function can be\nexpressed directly in terms of the proton one. Calculations of the EMC effect\non these lines give results which agree reasonably well to the existing\nexperimental data for $x<0.05$.\n", "  We discuss the QCD effects of the higher-twist operators in the nucleon\nspin-dependent structure functions measured by the polarized deep inelastic\nleptoproduction.\n  We particularly study the renormalization of the twist-3 and twist-4\noperators within the framework of operator product expansions and\nrenormalization group methods in perturbative QCD.\n  Emphasis will be placed on the role of the operators proportional to equation\nof motion which appear in the mixing of the higher-twist operators through\nrenormalization.\n  The logarithmic and power corrections in $Q^2$ due to the lowest spin\nhigher-twist operators are discussed for the first moment of $g_1$ structure\nfunction, Bjorken and Ellis-Jaffe sum rules, as well as the lower moments of\n$g_2$ structure function.\n", "  Phenomenological results of equal time, point to point spatial correlation\nfunctions of hadronic currents are used to deduce the structure of the QCD\nvacuum. It is found that a model with only quark condensate is not adequate to\nexplain the observations. Inclusion of condensate fluctuations (explicit four\npoint structure in the vacuum) leads to excellent overall agreement with the\nphenomenological curves and parameters in various channels.\n", "  Opening talk presented at the Adriatico Research Conference -- Trends in\nCollider Spin Physics and at the RIKEN Symposium -- Spin Structure of the\nNucleon.\n  We present an overview of the opportunities to explore QCD at a very high\nenergy polarized hadron collider. We review connections to low energy flavor\nphysics, transverse spin in QCD and higher twist. It is clear that polarized\ncolliders will provide a wealth of new information about the behavior of quarks\nand gluons inside hadrons complementing that available from lepton scattering\nand other more familiar probes of hadron structure.\n", "  Medium and high energy absorptive parts contribute to dispersive expressions\nfor D- wave scattering lengths, $a^0_2$ and $a^2_2$. For the model employed by\nBasdevant, Frogatt and Peterson we find the D- wave driving term contributions\nto the D- wave scattering lengths are $1.8\\cdot 10^{-4}$ to $a^0_2$ and\n$0.4\\cdot 10^{-4}$ to $a^2_2$, roughly $10\\%$ and $30\\%$ of their respective\n  central experimental values. Inequivalent sets of sum rules are used as a\ncompelling test of the consistency of the model for which crossing symmetry is\nnot guaranteed. Results for the F- wave scattering length $a^1_3$ are\npresented, completing the recent Roy equation analysis of \\pipi scattering in\nthe range for $a^0_0$ favored by standard chiral perturbation theory.\n", "  In this paper, we investigate the effects of the quantity $\\sigma_{TS}$ on\nthe spin-structure functions of nucleons in the resonance region. The Schwinger\nsum rule for the spin structure function $g_2(x,Q^2)$ at the real photon limit\nis derived for the nucleon treated as a composite system, and it provides a\ncrucial constraint on the longitudinal transition operator which has not been\ntreated consistently in the literature. The longitudinal amplitude $S_{\\frac\n12}$ is evaluated in the quark model with the transition operator that\ngenerates the Schwinger sum rule. The numerical results of the quantity\n$\\sigma_{TS}$ are presented for both spin structure functions $g_1(x,Q^2)$ and\n$g_2(x,Q^2)$ in the resonance region. Our results show that this quantity\n  plays an important role in the low $Q^2$ region, which can be tested in the\nfuture experiments at CEBAF.\n", "  Nucleon structure functions are studied within the chiral soliton approach to\nthe bosonized Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model. The valence quark approximation is\nemployed which is justified for moderate constituent quark masses ($\\sim$ 400\nMeV) as the contribution of the valence quark level dominates the predictions\nof nucleon properties. As examples the unpolarized structure functions for the\n${\\nu}p$ and ${\\bar \\nu}p$ scattering and the structure functions entering the\nGottfried sum rule are discussed. For the latter the model prediction is found\nto reasonably well agree with a corresponding low-scale parametrization of the\nempirical data.\n", "  We point out that dissociation of J/Psi by partons (mostly gluons) present in\nthe intermediate stage of heavy-ion collisions can explain J/Psi suppression\nobserved recently by the NA-50 Collaboration at the CERN-SPS in Pb-Pb\ninteractions. Suppression by intermediate stage gluons represents an additional\nmultiplicative factor to that given by Gerschel-Hufner mechanism. The agreement\nwith data on J/Psi suppression both in light- ions induced nuclear collisions\nand in Pb-Pb interactions requires that the life-time of intermediate gluons\nincreases with nucleon numbers of colliding nuclei. In our model the energy\ndensity of intermediate stage gluons in Pb-Pb collisions approaches for a short\ntime the critical density.\n", "  We develop a precise power counting rule (a generalization of Weinberg's\ncounting method for the nonlinear sigma model) for the electroweak theories\nformulated by chiral Lagrangians. Then we estimate the contributions of ``all''\nnext-to-leading order (NLO) bosonic operators to the amplitudes of the relevant\nscattering processes which can be measured at high energy colliders, such as\nthe LHC and future Linear Colliders. Based upon these results, we globally\nclassify the sensitivities of testing all NLO bosonic operators for probing the\nelectroweak symmetry breaking mechanism at high energy colliders.\n", "  We study $R$-parity violation in the framework of GUTs, focusing on the case\nthat $R$-parity is broken exclusively through $\\Delta B=1$, $\\Delta L=0$\neffective interactions. We construct two such models, an $SU(5)$\n  and an $SU(5)\\times U(1)_{X}$ model, in which $R$-parity breaking is induced\nthrough interactions with extra supermassive fields. The presence of only the\nBaryon Number violating operators ${d^c}{d^c}{u^c}$ requires an asymmetry\nbetween quarks and leptons, which is achieved either by virtue of the Higgs\nrepresentations used or by modifications in the matter multiplets. The latter\npossibility is realized in the second of the above models, where the\nleft-handed leptons have been removed from the representation in which they\nnormaly cohabit with the right-handed up quarks and enter as a combination of\nthe isodoublets in $(\\bf {{\\overline{5}},-3})$ and $(\\bf {5,-2})$\nrepresentations. In both models the particle content below the GUT scale is\nunaffected by the introduced $R$-parity breaking sector.\n", "  We explore the viability of baryogenesis from light scalar decays after the\nelectroweak phase transition. A minimal model of this kind is constructed with\nnew CP violating interactions involving a heavy fourth family. The departure\nfrom thermal equilbrium must come from topological defects like cosmic strings,\nand we show that almost any mechanism for producing the cosmic strings at the\nelectroweak scale results in a viable theory. Baryogenesis occurs in the fourth\ngeneration but the baryon number is later transported to the visible\ngenerations. This mechanism of indirect baryogenesis allows us to satisfy\nexperimental limits on the proton lifetime while still having perturbative\nbaryon number violation at low energies. The fourth family has very small\nmixing angles which opens the possibility of distinct observable signatures in\ncollider experiments.\n", "  The phenomenon of sonoluminescence (SL), originally observed some sixty years\nago, has recently become the focus of renewed interest, particularly with the\ndiscovery that one can trap a single bubble and induce it to exhibit SL stably\nover a large number of acoustical cycles.\n  In this work we shall adopt a version of the provocative suggestion put\nforward by Schwinger: the mechanism responsible for the radiation in SL is a\ndynamic version of the Casimir effect. It has been known since Casimir's\noriginal work in 1948 that the zero-point energy of quantum fields can be\nmodified by the presence of boundaries, and that these modifications generate\nobservable effects. For example, in Casimir's original work, the quantum\nfluctuations of the electromagnetic field in the presence of a pair of\nuncharged, parallel, perfectly conducting plates were shown to give rise to an\nattractive force between the plates.\n", "  CP violating dipole moments of leptons vanish at least to three loop order\nand are estimated to be $({m_l\\over Mev})\\times 1.6\\times 10^{- 40}$ e-cm in\nthe standard model (SM), where $m_l$ is the mass of the lepton. However they\ncan receive potentially large contributions in some beyond SM scenarios and\nthis makes them very sensitive probes of new physics. In this article we show\nthat a non universal interaction, involving leptoquarks to the quark-lepton\npair of the third generation through helicity unsuppressed couplings of the\norder of ordinary gauge couplings, can generate electric and weak dipole\nmoments of the order of $10^{-19}$ e-cm for the tau lepton. This is greater\nthan pure supersymmetric (SUSY) and left-right (L-R) contributions by almost\nthree orders of magnitude. It is also greater than mirror fermionic\ncontribution by an order of magnitude.\n  The measurements of $\\dzt$ and $\\dgt$ at LEP, SLC and TCF are expected to\nreach sensitivities of $10^{-18}$ e-cm and $10^{-19}$ e-cm respectively in near\nfuture. The observation of a non vanishing dipole moment of tau at these\nfacilities would therefore strongly favour superstring inspired light\nleptoquark mediated interactions, over pure SUSY or L-R interactions and\nperhaps also mirror generated mixings without some sort of quark-lepton\nunification as its origin.\n", "  We consider two coupled problems.\n  We study the dependence on photon virtuality $Q^2$ for the semihard\nquasi--elastic photoproduction of neutral vector mesons on a quark, gluon or\nreal photon (at $s\\gg p_{\\bot}^2,\\;Q^2; \\; p_{\\bot}^2\\gg \\mu^2 \\approx (0.3$\nGeV)$^2$). To this end we calculate the corresponding amplitudes (in an\nanalytical form) in the lowest nontrivial approximation of perturbative QCD. It\nis shown that the amplitude for the production of light meson varies very\nrapidly with the photon virtuality near $Q^2=0$.\n  We estimate the bound of the pQCD validity region for such processes. For the\nreal incident photon the obtained bound for the $\\rho$ meson production is very\nhigh. This bound decreases fast with the increase of $Q^2$, and we expect that\nthe virtual photoproduction at HERA gives opportunity to test the pQCD results.\nThe signature of this region is discussed. For the hard Compton effect the pQCD\nshould work good at not too high $p_{\\bot}$, and this effect seems measurable\nat HERA.\n", "  We consider the possibility of having a large branching ratio for the decay\n$b\\to s g$ coming from an enhanced Wilson coefficient of the chromomagnetic\ndipole operator. We show that values of $BR(b\\to s g)$ up to $\\sim 10\\%$ or\nmore are compatible with the constraints coming from the CLEO experimental\nresults on $BR(B\\to X_s\\gamma)$ and $BR(B\\to X_s\\phi)$. Such large values can\nreconcile the predictions of both the semileptonic branching ratio and the\ncharm counting with the present experimental results. We also discuss a\nsupersymmetric model with gluino-mediated flavour violations, which can account\nfor such large values of $BR(b\\to s g)$.\n", "  In the framework of the models with Higgs triplets, double charged Higgs\nbosons production in the processes $e^-e^-\\to\\delta ^{--}_{L,R}\\gamma$ are\nconsidered.\n", "  We analyze the consistency of the Chiral Lagrangian approach to the\ndescription of the spin 3/2 interacting theory. We argue that to lowest order\nin the 1/m expansion, the formalism leads to the appropriated constraints and\nthe theory is free of the so called ``off shell\" ambiguities.\n", "  We show that the `orthogonal' characteristics of the observed rapidity gaps\nand large forward energy flows in deep inelastic scattering at HERA, can be\ndescribed within a single framework. Our Monte Carlo model is based on\nperturbative QCD matrix elements and parton showers together with Lund string\nmodel hadronization, but has in addition a new mechanism for soft colour\ninteractions which modifies the perturbative colour structure and thereby the\nhadronization. Effects of perturbative multiparton emission are investigated\nand the non-perturbative treatment of the proton remnant is discussed and\ncomparison to the observed transverse energy flow is made. We investigate the\nresulting diffractive-like properties of the model; such as rapidity gap\nevents, $t$- and $M_X$-distributions and the diffractive structure function in\ncomparison to H1 data.\n", "  We examine the $\\Xi_Q - \\Xi'_Q$ mixing and heavy baryon masses in the heavy\nquark effective theory with the $\\mq$ corrections. In the conventional baryon\nassignment, we obtain the mixing angle $\\cos^2 \\theta = 0.87\\pm 0.03$ in virtue\nof the Gell-Mann-Okubo mass relation. On the other hand, if we adopt the new\nbaryon assignment given by Falk, the allowed region of the $\\Sigma_c$ mass is\nupper from 2372 MeV.\n", "  In this paper we develop a theoretical framework which allows us to study\nexcitations of the nucleon. Assuming an effective two-body interaction as a\nmodel for low-energy QCD, we derive a relativistic TDHF equation for a\nmany-body system of quarks. To render the Dirac-sea contribution tothe mean\nfield finite, we introduce a symmetry conserving regularization scheme. In the\nsmall amplitude limit we derive an RPA equation. The structure of the $ph$\ninteraction and modifications due to the regularization scheme are discussed.\nWe give a prescription to obtain a nucleon state with good angular momentum (J)\nand isospin (T) quantum numbers on mean-field level. To study excitations, we\ndevelop a tensor-RPA approach, which is an extension of the conventional RPA\ntechniques to systems with a nonscalar ground state. This allows us to\nconstruct excited states with good (J/T) quantum numbers. We discuss a method\nto reduce the overcomplete $ph$-space and compute the tensor-RPA interaction\nmatrix elements. Finally we extend our scheme to include ({3/2}^+,\n{3/2})-states.\n", "  In the framework of a newly developed factorization formalism which is based\non NRQCD, explicit cancellations are shown for the infrared divergences that\nappeared in the previously calculated hadronic annihilation decay rates of\nP-wave and D-wave heavy quarkonia. We extend them to a more general case that\nto leading order in $v^2$ and next-to-leading order in $\\alpha_s$, the infrared\ndivergences in the annihilation amplitudes of color-singlet\n$Q\\bar{Q}(^{2S+1}L_J)$ pair can be removed by including the contributions of\ncolor-octet operators $Q\\bar{Q}(^{2S+1}(L-1)_{J'})$,\n$Q\\bar{Q}(^{2S+1}(L-3)_{J''})$, ... in NRQCD. We also give the decay widths of\n$^3D_J\\rightarrow LH$ at leading order in $\\alpha_s$.\n", "  In reconstructing the top quark momentum from its decay products, one must\naccount for extra jets that can result from radiation of gluons. In this paper\nwe study soft gluon radiation in top production and decay at the Fermilab\nTevatron. We consider the cases where one or both $W$ bosons decays\nhadronically, {\\it i.e.}, where at least one of the top quarks can be fully\nreconstructed. We show results for gluon distributions at the Tevatron and find\nthat radiation from the $W$ decay products contributes substantially in the\ncentral region.\n"]}
