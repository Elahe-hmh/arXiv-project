Examples are provided by Thorne-Zytkov\nobjects, hot Jupiters, protoplanets with large moons, red supergiants in\nbinaries and globular clusters with central black hole. Instability criteria\ndue to resonance between internal and orbital frequencies in such a systems has\nbeen derived. To achieve assumed goals, generalized planar circular restricted\nthree body problem is investigated with one of the point masses, $M$, replaced\nwith spherical body of finite size. Mechanical system under consideration\nincludes two large masses $m$ and $M$ and the test body with small mass $\\mu$.\nOnly gravitational interactions are considered. Equations of motion are\npresented, and linear instability criteria are derived using quantifier\nelimination.\n  Motion of the test mass $\\mu$ is shown to be unstable due to resonance\nbetween orbital and internal frequencies if $\\frac{M}{d^3} < \\frac{4}{3} \\pi\n\\rho < \\frac{ M + 3 m \\left( 1+\\mu/M \\right)^{-1}}{d^3}$, where $\\rho$ is the\ncentral density of mass $M$, and $d$ distance between masses $m$ and $M$\n(circular orbit diameter).\n  The above result is important for core-collapse supernova theory, with mass\n$\\mu$ identified with helium core of the exploding massive star. The\ninstability cause off-center supernova \"ignition\" relative to the\ncenter-of-mass of the hydrogen envelope. The instability is also inevitable\nduring protoplanet growth, with hypothetical ejection of the rocky core from\ngas giants and formation of the \"puffy planets\" due to resonance with orbital\nfrequency. Hypothetical central intermediate black holes of the globular\nclusters are also in unstable position with respect to perturbations caused by\nthe Galaxy.\n", "  In this note we construct rigidly supersymmetric gauged sigma models and\ngauge theories on certain Einstein four-manifolds, and discuss constraints on\nthese theories. In work elsewhere, it was recently shown that on some\nnontrivial Einstein four-manifolds such as AdS$_4$, N=1 rigidly supersymmetric\nsigma models are constrained to have target spaces with exact K\\\"ahler forms.\nSimilarly, in gauged sigma models and gauge theories, we find that\nsupersymmetry imposes constraints on Fayet-Iliopoulos parameters, which have\nthe effect of enforcing that K\\\"ahler forms on quotient spaces be exact. We\nalso discuss general aspects of universality classes of gauged sigma models, as\nencoded by stacks, and also discuss affine bundle structures implicit in these\nconstructions.\n", "  The physics of low-energy quantum systems is usually studied without explicit\nconsideration of the background spacetime. Phenomena inherent to quantum theory\non curved space-time, such as Hawking radiation, are typically assumed to be\nonly relevant at extreme physical conditions: at high energies and in strong\ngravitational fields. Here we consider low-energy quantum mechanics in the\npresence of gravitational time dilation and show that the latter leads to\ndecoherence of quantum superpositions. Time dilation induces a universal\ncoupling between internal degrees of freedom and the centre-of-mass of a\ncomposite particle. The resulting correlations cause decoherence of the\nparticle's position, even without any external environment. We also show that\nthe weak time dilation on Earth is already sufficient to decohere micron scale\nobjects. Gravity therefore can account for the emergence of classicality and\nthe effect can in principle be tested in future matter wave experiments.\n", "  We investigate the behaviour of a two-component Fermi superfluid in a\ndouble-well potential. We numerically solve the time dependent Bogoliubov-de\nGennes equations and characterize the regimes of Josephson oscillations and\nself-trapping for different potential barriers and initial conditions. In the\nweak link limit the results agree with a two-mode model where the relative\npopulation and the phase difference between the two wells obey coupled\nnonlinear Josephson equations. A more complex dynamics is predicted for large\namplitude oscillations and large tunneling.\n", "  Iron-based compounds (IBS) display a surprising variety of superconducting\nproperties that seems to arise from the strong sensitivity of these systems to\ntiny details of the lattice structure. In this respect, systems that become\nsuperconducting under pressure, like CaFe$_2$As$_2$, are of particular\ninterest. Here we report on the first directional point-contact\nAndreev-reflection spectroscopy (PCARS) measurements on CaFe$_2$As$_2$ crystals\nunder quasi-hydrostatic pressure, and on the interpretation of the results\nusing a 3D model for Andreev reflection combined with ab-initio calculations of\nthe Fermi surface (within the density functional theory) and of the order\nparameter symmetry (within a random-phase-approximation approach in a\nten-orbital model). The almost perfect agreement between PCARS results at\ndifferent pressures and theoretical predictions highlights the intimate\nconnection between the changes in the lattice structure, a topological\ntransition in the hole-like Fermi surface sheet, and the emergence on the same\nsheet of an order parameter with a horizontal node line.\n", "  The two-slit experiment with quantum particles provides many insights into\nthe behaviour of quantum mechanics, including Bohr's complementarity principle.\nHere we analyze Einstein's recoiling slit version of the experiment and show\nhow the inevitable entanglement between the particle and the recoiling slit as\na which-way detector is responsible for complementarity. We derive the\nEnglert-Greenberger-Yasin duality from this entanglement, which can also be\nthought of as a consequence of sum-uncertainty relations between certain\ncomplementary observables of the recoiling slit. Thus, entanglement is an\nintegral part of the which-way detection process, and so is uncertainty, though\nin a completely different way from that envisaged by Bohr and Einstein.\n", "  In this paper canonical quantum gravity on noncommutative space-time is\nconsidered. The corresponding generalized classical theory is formulated by\nusing the moyal star product, which enables the representation of the field\nquantities depending on noncommuting coordinates by generalized quantities\ndepending on usual coordinates. But not only the classical theory has to be\ngeneralized in analogy to other field theories. Besides, the necessity arises\nto replace the commutator between the gravitational field operator and its\ncanonical conjugated quantity by a corresponding generalized expression on\nnoncommutative space-time. Accordingly the transition to the quantum theory has\nalso to be performed in a generalized way and leads to extended representations\nof the quantum theoretical operators. If the generalized representations of the\noperators are inserted to the generalized constraints, one obtains the\ncorresponding generalized quantum constraints including the Hamiltonian\nconstraint as dynamical constraint. After considering quantum geometrodynamics\nunder incorporation of a coupling to matter fields, the theory is transferred\nto the Ashtekar formalism. The holonomy representation of the gravitational\nfield as it is used in loop quantum gravity opens the possibility to calculate\nthe corresponding generalized area operator.\n", "  We experimentally investigate spin-polarized electron transport between a\npermalloy ferromagnet and the edge of a two-dimensional electron system with\nband inversion, realized in a narrow, 8~nm wide HgTe quantum well. In zero\nmagnetic field, we observe strong asymmetry of the edge potential distribution\nwith respect to the ferromagnetic ground lead. This result indicates, that the\nhelical edge channel, specific for the structures with band inversion even at\nthe conductive bulk, is strongly coupled to the ferromagnetic side contact,\npossibly due to the effects of proximity magnetization. It allows selective and\nspin-sensitive contacting of helical edge states.\n", "  The concept of $\\mu-$equicontinuity was introduced by Gilman to classify\ncellular automata. We show that under some conditions the sequence of Cesaro\naverages of a measure $\\mu,$ converge under the actions of a $\\mu\n-$equicontinuous CA. We address questions raised by Blanchard-Tisseur on\nwhether the limit measure is either shift-ergodic, a uniform Bernoulli measure\nor ergodic with respect to the CA. Many of our results hold for CA on\nmultidimensional subshifts.\n", "  Germanium ionization detectors with sensitivities as low as 100 eVee\n(electron-equivalent energy) open new windows for studies on neutrino and dark\nmatter physics. The relevant physics subjects are summarized. The detectors\nhave to measure physics signals whose amplitude is comparable to that of\npedestal electronic noise. To fully exploit this new detector technique,\nvarious experimental issues including quenching factors, energy reconstruction\nand calibration, signal triggering and selection as well as evaluation of their\nassociated efficiencies have to be attended. The efforts and results of a\nresearch program to address these challenges are presented.\n", "  The parity modulation of the ground state of a superconducting island is a\ndirect consequence of the presence of the Cooper pair condensate preferring an\neven number of charge carriers. The addition energy of an odd, unpaired\nquasiparticle equals to the superconducting gap, $\\Delta$, suppressing single\nelectron hopping in the low temperature limit. Controlling the quasiparticle\noccupation is of fundamental importance for superconducting qubits as single\nelectron tunneling results in decoherence. In particular, topological quantum\ncomputation relies on the parity control and readout of Majorana bound states.\nHere we present parity modulation for the first time of a niobium titanite\nnitride (NbTiN) Cooper-pair transistor coupled to aluminium (Al) leads. We show\nthat this circuit is compatible with the magnetic field requirement in the\nrange of 100 mT of inducing topological superconductivity in spin-orbit coupled\nnanowires. Our observed parity lifetime exceeding 1 minute is several orders of\nmagnitude higher than the required gate time of flux-controlled braiding of\nMajorana states. Our findings readily demonstrate that a NbTiN island can be\nparity-controlled and therefore provides a good platform for superconducting\ncoherent circuits operating in a magnetic field.\n", "  We discuss an extension of the massively parallel cosmological simulation\ncode GADGET-2, which now enables investigation of multiple and distinct\ngravitational force laws, provided they are dominated by a constant scaling of\nthe Newtonian force. In addition to simplifying investigations of a universally\nmodified force law, the ngravs extension provides a foundation for\nstate-of-the-art collisionless cosmological simulations of exotic gravitational\nscenarios. We briefly review the algorithms used by GADGET-2, and present our\nextension to multiple gravities, highlighting additional features that\nfacilitate consideration of exotic force laws. We discuss the accuracy and\nperformance of the ngravs extension, both internally and with an unaltered\nGADGET-2, in the relevant operational modes. The ngravs extension is publicly\nreleased to the research community.\n", "  The temperature dependence of electric transport properties of single-layer\nand few-layer graphene at large charge doping is of great interest both for the\nstudy of the scattering processes dominating the conductivity at different\ntemperatures and in view of the theoretically predicted possibility to reach\nthe superconducting state in such extreme conditions. Here we present the\nresults obtained in 3-, 4- and 5-layer graphene devices down to 3.5 K, where a\nlarge surface charge density up to about 6.8x10^14 cm^(-2) has been reached by\nemploying a novel polymer electrolyte solution for the electrochemical gating.\nIn contrast with recent results obtained in single-layer graphene, the\ntemperature dependence of the sheet resistance between 20 K and 280 K shows a\nlow-temperature dominance of a T^2 component - that can be associated with\nelectron-electron scattering - and, at about 100 K, a crossover to the classic\nelectron-phonon regime. Unexpectedly this crossover does not show any\ndependence on the induced charge density, i.e. on the large tuning of the Fermi\nenergy.\n", "  In this paper a nonlocal generalization of field quantization is suggested.\nThis quantization principle presupposes the assumption that the commutator\nbetween a field operator an the operator of the canonical conjugated variable\nreferring to other space-time points does not vanish as it is postulated in the\nusual setting of quantum field theory. Based on this presupposition the\ncorresponding expressions for the field operators, the eigenstates and the path\nintegral formula are determined. The nonlocal quantization principle also leads\nto a generalized propagator. If the dependence of the commutator between\noperators on different space-time points on the distance of these points is\nassumed to be described by a Gaussian function, one obtains that the propagator\nis damped by an exponential. This leads to a disappearance of UV divergences.\nThe transfer of the nonlocal quantization principle to canonical quantum\ngravity is considered as well. In this case the commutator has to be assumed to\ndepend also on the gravitational field, since the distance between two points\ndepends on the metric field.\n", "  In this short review, we revisit inflation in F(R)-gravity. We find several\nF(R)-models for viable inflation by applying some reconstruction techniques. A\nspecial attention is payed in the reproduction of the last Planck satellite\ndata. The possible generalizations of Starobinsky- like inflation are found and\ndiscussed. The early-time acceleration is analyzed in a higher- derivative\nquantum gravitational model which mainly reduces to F(R)-gravity.\n", "  The Coupled Cluster (CC) and full CI expansions are studied for three\nfermions with six and seven modes. Surprisingly the CC expansion is tailor made\nto characterize the usual SLOCC entanglement classes. It means that the notion\nof a SLOCC transformation shows up quite naturally as a one relating the CC and\nCI expansions, and going from the CI expansion to the CC one is equivalent to\nobtaining a form for the state where the structure of the entanglement classes\nis transparent. In this picture entanglement is characterized by the parameters\nof the cluster operators describing transitions from occupied states to\nsingles, doubles and triples of non occupied ones. Using the CC parametrization\nof states in the seven mode case we give a simple formula for the unique SLOCC\ninvariant $\\mathcal{J}$. Then we consider a perturbation problem featuring a\nstate from the unique SLOCC class characterized by $\\mathcal{J}\\neq 0$. For\nthis state with entanglement generated by doubles we investigate the phenomenon\nof changing the entanglement type due to the perturbing effect of triples. We\nshow that there are states with real amplitudes such that their entanglement\nencoded into configurations of clusters of doubles is protected from errors\ngenerated by triples. Finally we put forward a proposal to use the parameters\nof the cluster operator describing transitions to doubles for entanglement\ncharacterization. Compared to the usual SLOCC classes this provides a coarse\ngrained approach to fermionic entanglement.\n", "  ALICE is one of four large experiments at the CERN Large Hadron Collider near\nGeneva, specially designed to study particle production in ultra-relativistic\nheavy-ion collisions. Located 52 meters underground with 28 meters of\noverburden rock, it has also been used to detect muons produced by cosmic ray\ninteractions in the upper atmosphere. In this paper, we present the\nmultiplicity distribution of these atmospheric muons and its comparison with\nMonte Carlo simulations. This analysis exploits the large size and excellent\ntracking capability of the ALICE Time Projection Chamber. A special emphasis is\ngiven to the study of high multiplicity events containing more than 100\nreconstructed muons and corresponding to a muon areal density $\\rho_{\\mu} >\n5.9~$m$^{-2}$. Similar events have been studied in previous underground\nexperiments such as ALEPH and DELPHI at LEP. While these experiments were able\nto reproduce the measured muon multiplicity distribution with Monte Carlo\nsimulations at low and intermediate multiplicities, their simulations failed to\ndescribe the frequency of the highest multiplicity events. In this work we show\nthat the high multiplicity events observed in ALICE stem from primary cosmic\nrays with energies above $10^{16}$ eV and that the frequency of these events\ncan be successfully described by assuming a heavy mass composition of primary\ncosmic rays in this energy range. The development of the resulting air showers\nwas simulated using the latest version of QGSJET to model hadronic\ninteractions. This observation places significant constraints on alternative,\nmore exotic, production mechanisms for these events.\n", "  In certain circumstances tools of Riemannian geometry are sufficient to\naddress questions arising in the more general Finslerian context. We show that\none such instance presents itself in the characterisation of geodesics in\nRanders spaces of constant flag curvature. To achieve a simple, Riemannian\nderivation of this special family of curves, we exploit the connection between\nRanders spaces and the Zermelo problem of time-optimal navigation in the\npresence of background fields. The characterisation of geodesics is then proven\nby generalising an intuitive argument developed recently for the solution of\nthe quantum Zermelo problem.\n", "  Effective spin mixing conductance (ESMC) across the nonmagnetic metal\n(NM)/ferromagnet interface, spin Hall conductivity (SHC) and spin diffusion\nlength (SDL) in the NM layer govern the functionality and performance of pure\nspin current devices with spin pumping technique. We show that all three\nparameters can be tuned significantly by the spin orbit coupling (SOC) strength\nof the NM layer in systems consisting of ferromagnetic insulating Y3Fe5O12\nlayer and metallic Pd1-xPtx layer. Surprisingly, the ESMC is observed to\nincrease significantly with x changing from 0 to 1.0. The SHC in PdPt alloys,\ndominated by the intrinsic term, is enhanced notably with increasing x.\nMeanwhile, the SDL is found to decrease when Pd atoms are replaced by heavier\nPt atoms, validating the SOC induced spin flip scattering model in polyvalent\nPdPt alloys. The capabilities of both spin current generation and spin charge\nconversion are largely heightened via the SOC. These findings highlight the\nmultifold tuning effects of the SOC in developing the new generation of\nspintronic devices.\n", "  We consider cosmological models in which dark matter feels a fifth force\nmediated by the dark energy scalar field, also known as coupled dark energy.\nOur interest resides in estimating forecasts for future surveys like Euclid\nwhen we take into account non-linear effects, relying on new fitting functions\nthat reproduce the non-linear matter power spectrum obtained from N-body\nsimulations. We obtain fitting functions for models in which the dark\nmatter-dark energy coupling is constant. Their validity is demonstrated for all\navailable simulations in the redshift range $z=0-1.6$ and wave modes below\n$k=10 \\text{h/Mpc}$. These fitting formulas can be used to test the predictions\nof the model in the non-linear regime without the need for additional\ncomputing-intensive N-body simulations. We then use these fitting functions to\nperform forecasts on the constraining power that future galaxy-redshift surveys\nlike Euclid will have on the coupling parameter, using the Fisher matrix method\nfor galaxy clustering (GC) and weak lensing (WL). We find that by using\ninformation in the non-linear power spectrum, and combining the GC and WL\nprobes, we can constrain the dark matter-dark energy coupling constant squared,\n$\\beta^{2}$, with precision smaller than 4\\% and all other cosmological\nparameters better than 1\\%, which is a considerable improvement of more than an\norder of magnitude compared to corresponding linear power spectrum forecasts\nwith the same survey specifications.\n", "  An essential element of classical computation is the \"if-then\" construct,\nthat accepts a control bit and an arbitrary gate, and provides conditional\nexecution of the gate depending on the value of the controlling bit. On the\nother hand, quantum theory prevents the existence of an analogous universal\nconstruct accepting a control qubit and an arbitrary quantum gate as its input.\nNevertheless, there are controllable sets of quantum gates for which such a\nconstruct exists. Here we provide a necessary and sufficient condition for a\nset of unitary transformations to be controllable, and we give a complete\ncharacterization of controllable sets in the two dimensional case. This result\nreveals an interesting connection between the problem of controllability and\nthe problem of extracting information from an unknown quantum gate while using\nit.\n", "  We combine the ideas of intensity interferometry, polarization optics and\nBell's measurement into an experimental proposal which is hosted in a\n$\\nu\\,$=$\\,2$ quantum Hall (QH) edge state. Our interferometer comprises of a\nsingle gate, that separates the spin resolved edge states of $\\nu$\\,=\\,$2$\nstate. An analog of waveplate (from polarization optics) is realized by\nexposing the individual edges to nano-magnets over a finite length which\nfacilitates coherent manipulation of the electron spin on the edge. We show\nthat the in-plane rotation of magnetization direction of the nano-magnets\nresults in oscillations observed solely in the cross-correlated noise which\narises from two particle interference. Through numerical simulations we\ndemonstrate that our proposal is well within the reach of recent experimental\ndevelopments of spin manipulations on the QH edge.\n", "  We propose that one of the sources in the recently detected system CR7 by\nSobral et al. (2015) through spectro-photometric measurements at $z = 6.6$\nharbors a direct collapse blackhole (DCBH). We argue that the LW radiation\nfield required for direct collapse in source A is provided by sources B and C.\nBy tracing the LW production history and star formation rate over cosmic time\nfor the halo hosting CR7 in a $\\Lambda$CDM universe, we demonstrate that a DCBH\ncould have formed at $z\\sim 20$. The spectrum of source A is well fit by\nnebular emission from primordial gas around a BH with MBH $\\sim 4.4 \\times 10^6\n\\ \\rm M_{\\odot}$ accreting at a 40 % of the Eddington rate, which strongly\nsupports our interpretation of the data. Combining these lines of evidence, we\nargue that CR7 might well be the first DCBH candidate.\n", "  Unimodular Gravity (UG) is a restricted version of General Relativity (GR) in\nwhich the determinant of the metric is a fixed function and the field equations\nare given by the trace-free part of the full Einstein equations. The background\nequations in UG and GR are identical. It was recently claimed that, the first\norder contribution in the temperature fluctuation of the Cosmic Microwave\nBackground (CMB) in UG is different from GR. In this work, we calculate the\nfirst order perturbation equations in UG and show that the Sachs-Wolfe effect\nin UG, in terms of gauge invariant variables, is identical to GR. We also show\nthat the second order perturbation equation of Mukhnanov-Sasaki variable in UG,\nis identical to GR. The only difference comes from the gauge choices due the\nconstraint on the metric determinant. Hence, UG and GR are identical and\nindistinguishable in CMB data on large scales.\n", "  A generalized quantization principle is considered, which incorporates\nnontrivial commutation relations of the components of the variables of the\nquantized theory with the components of the corresponding canonical conjugated\nmomenta referring to other space-time directions. The corresponding commutation\nrelations are formulated by using quaternions. At the beginning, this extended\nquantization concept is applied to the variables of quantum mechanics. The\nresulting Dirac equation and the corresponding generalized expression for plane\nwaves are formulated and some consequences for quantum field theory are\nconsidered. Later, the quaternionic quantization principle is transferred to\ncanonical quantum gravity. Within quantum geometrodynamics as well as the\nAshtekar formalism the generalized algebraic properties of the operators\ndescribing the gravitational observables and the corresponding quantum\nconstraints implied by the generalized representations of these operators are\ndetermined. The generalized algebra also induces commutation relations of the\nseveral components of the quantized variables with each other. Finally, the\nquaternionic quantization procedure is also transferred to $\\mathcal{N}=1$\nsupergravity. Accordingly, the quantization principle has to be generalized to\nbe compatible with Dirac brackets, which appear in canonical quantum\nsupergravity.\n", "  The AB-BA domain wall in gapped graphene bilayers is a rare naked structure\nhosting topological electronic states. Here we show, for the first time, direct\nimaging of its topological edge states by using scanning tunneling microscope.\nThe simultaneously obtained atomic-resolution images of the domain wall provide\nus unprecedented opportunities to measure the spatially-varying edge states\nwithin it. The one-dimensional conducting channels are observed to be mainly\nlocated around the two edges of the domain wall, which is reproduced quite well\nby our theoretical calculations. Our experiment further demonstrates that the\none-dimensional topological states are quite robust even in the presence of\nhigh magnetic fields.\n", "  Fluid dynamics in intrinsically curved geometries is encountered in many\nphysical systems in nature, ranging from microscopic bio-membranes all the way\nup to general relativity at cosmological scales. Despite the diversity of\napplications, all of these systems share a common feature: the free motion of\nparticles is affected by inertial forces originating from the curvature of the\nembedding space. Here we reveal a fundamental process underlying fluid dynamics\nin curved space: the free motion of fluids, in the complete absence of solid\nwalls or obstacles, exhibits loss of energy due exclusively to the intrinsic\ncurvature of space. We find that local sources of curvature generate viscous\nstresses as a result of the inertial forces. The curvature-induced viscous\nforces are shown to cause hitherto unnoticed and yet appreciable energy\ndissipation, which might play a significant role for a variety of physical\nsystems involving fluid dynamics in curved spaces.\n", "  Various important and useful quantities or measures that characterize the\ntopological network structure are usually investigated for a network, then they\nare averaged over the samples. In this paper, we propose an explicit\nrepresentation by the beforehand averaged adjacency matrix over samples of\ngrowing networks as a new general framework for investigating the\ncharacteristic quantities. It is applied to some network models, and shows a\ngood approximation of degree distribution asymptotically. In particular, our\napproach will be applicable through the numerical calculations instead of\nintractable theoretical analysises, when the time-course of degree is a\nmonotone increasing function like power-law or logarithm.\n", "  Both massless light ray and objects with nonzero mass experience trajectory\nbending in a gravitational field. In this work the bending of trajectories of\nmassive objects in a Schwarzschild spacetime and the corresponding\ngravitational lensing (GL) effects are studied. A particle sphere for\nSchwarzschild black hole (BH) is found with its radius a simple function of the\nparticle velocity and proportional to the BH mass. A single master formula for\nboth the massless and massive particle bending angle is found, in the form of\nan elliptic function depending only on the velocity and impact parameter. This\nbending angle is expanded in both large and small velocity limits and large and\nsmall impact parameter limits. The corresponding deflection angle for weak and\nstrong GL of massive particles are analyzed, and their corrections to the light\nray deflection angles are obtained. The dependence of the deflection angles on\nthe source angle and the particle speed is investigated. Finally we discuss the\npotential applications of the results in hypervelocity star observations and in\ndetermining mass/mass hierarchy of slow particles/objects.\n", "  The light-like dispersion of graphene monolayer results in many novel\nelectronic properties in it1, however, this gapless feature also limits the\napplications of graphene monolayer in digital electronics2. A rare working\nsolution to generate a moderate bandgap in graphene monolayer is to cut it into\none-dimensional (1D) nanometre-wide ribbons3-13. Here we show that a wide\nbandgap can be created in a unique 1D strained structure, i.e.,\ngraphene-nanoribbon-like (GNR-like) structure, of a continuous graphene sheet\nvia strong interaction between graphene and the metal substrate, instead of\ncutting graphene monolayer. The GNR-like structures with width of only a few\nnanometers are observed in a continuous graphene sheet grown on Rh foil by\nusing thermal strain engineering. Spatially-resolved scanning tunnelling\nspectroscopy revealed bandgap opening of a few hundreds meV in the GNR-like\nstructure in an otherwise continuous metallic graphene sheet, directly\ndemonstrating the realization of a metallic-semiconducting-metallic junction\nentirely in a graphene monolayer. We also show that it is possible to tailor\nthe structure and electronic properties of the GNR-like structure by using\nscanning tunnelling microscope.\n", "  A commonly used approach to study stability in a complex system is by\nanalyzing the Jacobian matrix at an equilibrium point of a dynamical system.\nThe equilibrium point is stable if all eigenvalues have negative real parts.\nHere, by obtaining eigenvalue bounds of the Jacobian, we show that stable\ncomplex systems will favor mutualistic and competitive relationships that are\nasymmetrical (non-reciprocative) and trophic relationships that are symmetrical\n(reciprocative). Additionally, we define a measure called the interdependence\ndiversity that quantifies how distributed the dependencies are between the\ndynamical variables in the system. We find that increasing interdependence\ndiversity has a destabilizing effect on the equilibrium point, and the effect\nis greater for trophic relationships than for mutualistic and competitive\nrelationships. These predictions are consistent with empirical observations in\necology. More importantly, our findings suggest stabilization algorithms that\ncan apply very generally to a variety of complex systems.\n", "  Brane tilings describe Lagrangians (vector multiplets, chiral multiplets, and\nthe superpotential) of four dimensional $\\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetric gauge\ntheories. These theories, written in terms of a bipartite graph on a torus,\ncorrespond to worldvolume theories on $N$ D$3$-branes probing a toric\nCalabi-Yau threefold singularity. A pair of permutations compactly encapsulates\nthe data necessary to specify a brane tiling. We show that geometric\nconsistency for brane tilings, which ensures that the corresponding quantum\nfield theories are well behaved, imposes constraints on the pair of\npermutations, restricting certain products constructed from the pair to have no\none-cycles. Permutations without one-cycles are known as derangements. We\nillustrate this formulation of consistency with known brane tilings. Counting\nformulas for consistent brane tilings with an arbitrary number of chiral\nbifundamental fields are written down in terms of delta functions over\nsymmetric groups.\n", "  Graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) are one-dimensional (1D) structures that exhibit\na rich variety of electronic properties1-17. Therefore, they are predicted to\nbe the building blocks in next-generation nanoelectronic devices.\nTheoretically, it has been demonstrated that armchair GNRs can be divided into\nthree families, i.e., Na = 3p, Na = 3p + 1, and Na = 3p + 2 (here Na is the\nnumber of dimer lines across the ribbon width and p is an integer), according\nto their electronic structures, and the energy gaps for the three families are\nquite different even with the same p1,3-6. However, a systematic experimental\nverification of this fundamental prediction is still lacking, owing to very\nlimited atomic-level control of the width of the armchair GNRs\ninvestigated7,9,10,13,17. Here, we studied electronic structures of the\narmchair GNRs with atomically well-defined widths ranging from Na = 6 to Na =\n26 by using scanning tunnelling microscope (STM). Our result demonstrated\nexplicitly that all the studied armchair GNRs exhibit semiconducting gaps due\nto quantum confinement and, more importantly, the observed gaps as a function\nof Na are well grouped into the three categories, as predicted by\ndensity-functional theory calculations3. Such a result indicated that we can\ntune the electronic properties of the armchair GNRs dramatically by simply\nadding or cutting one carbon dimer line along the ribbon width.\n", "  Magnons are the energy quanta of fundamental spin excitations, namely spin\nwaves, and they can make a considerable contribution to energy transport in\nsome magnetic materials in a similar manner as lattice vibration waves or\nphonons. The coupling and possible non-equilibrium between magnons and other\nenergy carriers have been used to explain several recently discovered thermally\ndriven spin transport and energy conversion phenomena. Here, we report\nexperiments in which local non-equilibrium between magnons and phonons in a\nsingle crystalline bulk magnetic insulator, Y3Fe5O12 (yttrium iron garnet, or\nYIG), has been created optically within a focused laser spot and probed\ndirectly with the use of micro-Brillouin light scattering (BLS). By analyzing\nthe experimental results with a thermally induced magnon diffusion model, we\nobtain the magnon diffusion length of thermal magnons. By explicitly\nestablishing non-equilibrium between magnons and phonons, our studies represent\nan important step toward a quantitative understanding of various spin-heat\ncoupling phenomena.\n", "  We investigate the time-dependent reformation of the quasiparticle peak in a\ncorrelated metal near the Mott transition, after the system is quenched into a\nhot electron state and equilibrates with an environment which is colder than\nthe Fermi-liquid crossover temperature. Close to the transition, we identify a\npurely electronic bottleneck timescale, which depends on the spectral weight\naround the Fermi energy in the bad metallic phase in a non-linear way. This\ntimescale can be orders of magnitude larger than the bare electronic hopping\ntime, so that a separation electronic and lattice timescales may break down.\nThe results are obtained using nonequilibrium dynamical mean-field theory and a\nslave-rotor representation of the Anderson impurity model.\n", "  The Universe is mostly composed of large and relatively empty domains known\nas cosmic voids, whereas its matter content is predominantly distributed along\ntheir boundaries. The remaining material inside them, either dark or luminous\nmatter, is attracted to these boundaries and causes voids to expand faster and\nto grow emptier over time. Using the distribution of galaxies centered on voids\nidentified in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and adopting minimal assumptions on\nthe statistical motion of these galaxies, we constrain the average matter\ncontent $\\Omega_\\mathrm{m}=0.281\\pm0.031$ in the Universe today, as well as the\nlinear growth rate of structure $f/b=0.417\\pm0.089$ at median redshift\n$\\bar{z}=0.57$, where $b$ is the galaxy bias ($68\\%$ C.L.). These values\noriginate from a percent-level measurement of the anisotropic distortion in the\nvoid-galaxy cross-correlation function, $\\varepsilon = 1.003\\pm0.012$, and are\nrobust to consistency tests with bootstraps of the data and simulated mock\ncatalogs within an additional systematic uncertainty of half that size. They\nsurpass (and are complementary to) existing constraints by unlocking\ncosmological information on smaller scales through an accurate model of\nnonlinear clustering and dynamics in void environments. As such, our analysis\nfurnishes a powerful probe of deviations from Einstein's general relativity in\nthe low-density regime which has largely remained untested so far. We find no\nevidence for such deviations in the data at hand.\n", "  We probe the room temperature photoluminescence of $N$-layer molybdenum\nditelluride (MoTe$_2$) in the continuous wave (cw) regime. The\nphotoluminescence quantum yield of monolayer MoTe$_2$ is three times larger\nthan in bilayer MoTe$_2$ and forty times greater than in the bulk limit. Mono-\nand bilayer MoTe$_2$ display almost symmetric emission lines at $1.10~\\rm eV$\nand $1.07~\\rm eV$, respectively, which predominantly arise from direct\nradiative recombination of the A exciton. In contrast, $N\\geq3-$layer MoTe$_2$\nexhibits a much reduced photoluminescence quantum yield and a broader,\nredshifted and seemingly bimodal photoluminescence spectrum. The low- and\nhigh-energy contributions are attributed to emission from the indirect and\ndirect optical band gaps, respectively. Bulk MoTe$_2$ displays a broad emission\nline with a dominant contribution at 0.94~eV that is assigned to emission from\nthe indirect optical band gap. As compared to related systems (such as MoS$_2$,\nMoSe$_2$, WS$_2$ and WSe$_2$), the smaller energy difference between the\nmonolayer direct optical band gap and the bulk indirect optical band gap leads\nto a smoother increase of the photoluminescence quantum yield as $N$ decreases.\nIn addition, we study the evolution of the photoluminescence intensity in\nmonolayer MoTe$_2$ as a function of the exciton formation rate $W_\\mathrm{abs}$\nup to $3.6\\times 10^{22}~\\rm{cm}^{-2} s^{-1}$. The lineshape of the\nphotoluminescence spectrum remains largely independent of $W_\\mathrm{abs}$,\nwhereas the photoluminescence intensity grows sub-linearly above\n$W_\\mathrm{abs}\\sim 10^{21}~\\rm cm^{-2} s^{-1}$. This behavior is assigned to\nexciton-exciton annihilation and is well-captured by an elementary rate\nequation model.\n", "  We present a public catalogue of voids in the Baryon Oscillation\nSpectroscopic Survey (BOSS) Data Release 11 LOWZ and CMASS galaxy surveys. This\ncatalogue contains information on the location, sizes, densities, shapes and\nbounding surfaces of 8956 independent, disjoint voids, making it the largest\npublic void catalogue to date. Voids are identified using a version of the\nZOBOV algorithm, the operation of which has been calibrated through tests on\nmock galaxy populations in N-body simulations, as well as on a suite of 4096\nmock catalogues which fully reproduce the galaxy clustering, survey masks and\nselection functions. Based on this, we estimate a false positive detection rate\nof 3%. Comparison with mock catalogues limits deviations of the void size\ndistribution from that predicted in the $\\Lambda$CDM model to be less than 6%\nfor voids with effective radius $8<R_v<60\\,h^{-1}$Mpc and in the redshift range\n$0.15<z<0.7$. This could tightly constrain modified gravity scenarios and\nmodels with a varying equation of state, but we identify systematic biases\nwhich must be accounted for to reduce the theoretical uncertainty in the\npredictions for these models to the current level of precision attained from\nthe data. We also examine the distribution of void densities and identify a\ndeficit of the deepest voids relative to $\\Lambda$CDM expectations, which is\nsignificant at more than the $3\\sigma$ equivalent level. We discuss possible\nexplanations for this discrepancy but at present its cause remains unknown.\n", "  Strain-mediated voltage control of magnetization in\npiezoelectric/ferromagnetic systems is a promising mechanism to implement\nenergy-efficient spintronic memory devices. Here, we demonstrate giant voltage\nmanipulation of MgO magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJ) on a\nPb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)0.7Ti0.3O3 (PMN-PT) piezoelectric substrate with (001)\norientation. It is found that the magnetic easy axis, switching field, and the\ntunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) of the MTJ can be efficiently controlled by\nstrain from the underlying piezoelectric layer upon the application of a gate\nvoltage. Repeatable voltage controlled MTJ toggling between high/low-resistance\nstates is demonstrated. More importantly, instead of relying on the intrinsic\nanisotropy of the piezoelectric substrate to generate the required strain, we\nutilize anisotropic strain produced using local gating scheme, which is\nscalable and amenable to practical memory applications. Additionally, the\nadoption of crystalline MgO-based MTJ on piezoelectric layer lends itself to\nhigh TMR in the strain-mediated MRAM devices.\n", "  The measurement of prompt D-meson production as a function of multiplicity in\np-Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}=5.02$ TeV with the ALICE detector at the\nLHC is reported. D$^0$, D$^+$ and D$^{*+}$ mesons are reconstructed via their\nhadronic decay channels in the centre-of-mass rapidity range $-0.96<\ny_{\\mathrm{cms}}<0.04$ and transverse momentum interval $1<p_{\\rm T}<24$\nGeV/$c$. The multiplicity dependence of D-meson production is examined by\neither comparing yields in p-Pb collisions in different event classes, selected\nbased on the multiplicity of produced particles or zero-degree energy, with\nthose in pp collisions, scaled by the number of binary nucleon-nucleon\ncollisions (nuclear modification factor); as well as by evaluating the\nper-event yields in p-Pb collisions in different multiplicity intervals\nnormalised to the multiplicity-integrated ones (relative yields). The nuclear\nmodification factors for D$^0$, D$^+$ and D$^{*+}$ are consistent with one\nanother. The D-meson nuclear modification factors as a function of the\nzero-degree energy are consistent with unity within uncertainties in the\nmeasured $p_{\\rm T}$ regions and event classes. The relative D-meson yields,\ncalculated in various $p_{\\rm T}$ intervals, increase as a function of the\ncharged-particle multiplicity. The results are compared with the equivalent pp\nmeasurements at $\\sqrt{s}=7$ TeV as well as with EPOS~3 calculations.\n", "  A synergistic effect between strong electron correlation and spin-orbit\ninteraction (SOI) has been theoretically predicted to result in a new\ntopological state of quantum matter on Kondo insulators (KIs), so-called\ntopological Kondo insulators (TKIs). One TKI candidate has been experimentally\nobserved on the KI SmB6(001), and the origin of the surface states (SS) and the\ntopological order of SmB6 has been actively discussed. Here, we show a metallic\nSS on the clean surface of another TKI candidate YbB12(001), using\nangle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy. The SS showed temperature-dependent\nreconstruction corresponding with the Kondo effect observed for bulk states.\nDespite the low-temperature insulating bulk, the reconstructed SS with c-f\nhybridization was metallic, forming a closed Fermi contour surrounding\n$\\bar{\\Gamma}$ on the surface Brillouin zone and agreeing with the\ntheoretically expected behavior for SS on TKIs. These results demonstrate the\ntemperature-dependent holistic reconstruction of two-dimensional states\nlocalized on KIs surface driven by the Kondo effect.\n", "  We calculate root-mean-square radii for a three-body system confined to two\nspatial dimensions and consisting of two identical bosons ($A$) and one\ndistinguishable particle ($B$). We use zero-range two-body interactions between\neach of the pairs, and focus thereby directly on universal properties. We solve\nthe Faddeev equations in momentum space and express the mean-square radii in\nterms of first-order derivatives of the Fourier transforms of densities. The\nstrengths of the interactions are adjusted for each set of masses to produce\nequal two-body bound-state energies between different pairs. The mass ratio,\n${\\cal A}=m_B/m_A$, between particles $B$ and $A$ are varied from $0.01$ to\n$100$ providing a number of bound states decreasing from $8$ to $2$. Energies\nand mean-square radii of these states are analyzed for small ${\\cal A}$ by use\nof the Born-Oppenheimer potential between the two heavy $A$-particles. For\nlarge ${\\cal A}$ the radii of the two bound states are consistent with a\nslightly asymmetric three-body structure. When ${\\cal A}$ approaches thresholds\nfor binding of the three-body excited states, the corresponding mean-square\nradii diverge inversely proportional to the deviation of the three-body energy\nfrom the two-body thresholds. The structures at these three-body thresholds\ncorrespond to bound $AB$-dimers and one loosely bound $A$-particle.\n", "  Heat transfer across interfaces of graphene and polar dielectrics (e.g. SiO2)\ncould be mediated by direct phonon coupling, as well as electronic coupling\nwith remote interfacial phonons (RIPs). To understand the relative contribution\nof each component, we develop a new pump-probe technique, called\nvoltage-modulated thermoreflectance (VMTR), to accurately measure the change of\ninterfacial thermal conductance under an electrostatic field. We employed VMTR\non top gates of graphene field-effect transistors and find that the thermal\nconductance of SiO2/graphene/SiO2 interfaces increases by up to {\\Delta}G=0.8\nMW m-2 K-1 under electrostatic fields of <0.2 V nm-1 . We propose two possible\nexplanations for the observed {\\Delta}G. First, since the applied electrostatic\nfield induces charge carriers in graphene, our VMTR measurements could\noriginate from heat transfer between the charge carriers in graphene and RIPs\nin SiO2. Second, the increase in heat conduction could be caused by better\nconformity of graphene interfaces un-der electrostatic pressure exerted by the\ninduced charge carriers. Regardless of the origins of the observed {\\Delta}G,\nour VMTR measurements establish an upper limit for heat transfer from unbiased\ngraphene to SiO2 substrates via RIP scattering; i.e., only <2 % of the\ninterfacial heat transport is facilitated by RIP scattering even at a carrier\nconcentration of 4x10^12 cm-2.\n", "  We present a platform for the simulation of quantum magnetism with full\ncontrol of interactions between pairs of spins at arbitrary distances in one-\nand two-dimensional lattices. In our scheme, two internal atomic states\nrepresent a pseudo-spin for atoms trapped within a photonic crystal waveguide\n(PCW). With the atomic transition frequency aligned inside a band gap of the\nPCW, virtual photons mediate coherent spin-spin interactions between lattice\nsites. To obtain full control of interaction coefficients at arbitrary\natom-atom separations, ground-state energy shifts are introduced as a function\nof distance across the PCW. In conjunction with auxiliary pump fields,\nspin-exchange versus atom-atom separation can be engineered with arbitrary\nmagnitude and phase, and arranged to introduce non-trivial Berry phases in the\nspin lattice, thus opening new avenues for realizing novel topological spin\nmodels. We illustrate the broad applicability of our scheme by explicit\nconstruction for several well known spin models.\n", "  The Integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect is a large-angle modulation of the\ncosmic microwave background (CMB), generated when CMB photons traverse evolving\npotential wells associated with large scale structure (LSS). Recent efforts\nhave been made to reconstruct maps of the ISW signal using information from\nsurveys of galaxies and other LSS tracers, but investigation into how survey\nsystematics affect their reliability has so far been limited. Using simulated\nISW and LSS maps, we study the impact of galaxy survey properties and\nsystematic errors on the accuracy of reconstructed ISW signal. We find that\nsystematics that affect the observed distribution of galaxies along the line of\nsight, such as photo-z and bias-evolution related errors, have a relatively\nminor impact on reconstruction quality. In contrast, however, we find that\ndirection-dependent calibration errors can be very harmful. Specifically, we\nfind that in order to avoid significant degradation of our reconstruction\nquality statistics, direction-dependent number density fluctuations due to\nsystematics must be controlled so that their variance is smaller than $10^{-6}$\n(which corresponds to a 0.1% calibration). Additionally, we explore the\nimplications of our results for attempts to use reconstructed ISW maps to shed\nlight on the origin of large-angle CMB alignments. We find that there is only a\nweak correlation between the true and reconstructed angular momentum\ndispersion, which quantifies alignment, even for reconstructed ISW maps which\nare fairly accurate overall.\n", "  We discuss a study to evaluate the extent to which free-response questions\ncould be approximated by multiple-choice equivalents. Two carefully designed\nresearch-based multiple-choice questions were transformed into a free-response\nformat and administered on the final exam in a calculus-based introductory\nphysics course. The original multiple-choice questions were administered in\nanother similar introductory physics course on final exam. Findings suggest\nthat carefully designed multiple-choice questions can reflect the relative\nperformance of the free-response questions while maintaining the benefits of\nease of grading and quantitative analysis, especially if the different choices\nin the multiple-choice questions are weighted to reflect the different levels\nof understanding that students display.\n", "  We show that the lifetime-reduced fidelity of a semiconductor quantum\ndot-cavity single photon nonlinearity can be restored by polarization pre- and\npostselection. This is realized with a polarization degenerate microcavity in\nthe weak coupling regime, where an output polarizer enables quantum\ninterference of the two orthogonally polarized transmission amplitudes. This\nallows us to transform incident coherent light into a stream of strongly\ncorrelated photons with a second-order correlation function of g2(0)~40, larger\nthan previous experimental results even in the strong-coupling regime. This\npurification technique might also be useful to improve the fidelity of quantum\ndot based logic gates.\n", "  Topological phononic crystals, alike their electronic counterparts, are\ncharacterized by a bulk-edge correspondence where the interior of a material\ndictates the existence of stable surface or boundary modes. In the mechanical\nsetup, such surface modes can be used for various applications such as\nwave-guiding, vibration isolation, or the design of static properties such as\nstable floppy modes where parts of a system move freely. Here, we provide a\nclassification scheme of topological phonons based on local symmetries. We\nimport and adapt the classification of non-interacting electron systems and\nembed it into the mechanical setup. Moreover, we provide an extensive set of\nexamples that illustrate our scheme and can be used to generate new models in\nunexplored symmetry classes. Our works unifies the vast recent literature on\ntopological phonons and paves the way to future applications of topological\nsurface modes in mechanical metamaterials.\n", "  The effects of pressure on a quantum spin liquid are investigated in an\norganic Mott insulator $\\kappa$-(ET)$_2$Ag$_2$(CN)$_3$ with a spin-1/2\ntriangular lattice. The application of negative chemical pressure to\n$\\kappa$-(ET)$_2$Cu$_2$(CN)$_3$, which is a well-known sister Mott insulator,\nallows for extensive tuning of antiferromagnetic exchange coupling, with\n$J/k_{\\rm B} = 175 - 310$ K, under hydrostatic pressure. Based on $^{13}$C\nnuclear magnetic resonance measurements under pressure, we uncover universal\nscaling in the static and dynamic spin susceptibilities down to low\ntemperatures $\\sim 0.1k_{\\rm B}T/J$. The persistent fluctuations and residual\nspecific heat coefficient are consistent with the presence of gapless low-lying\nexcitations. Our results thus demonstrate fundamental finite-temperature\nproperties of quantum spin liquid in a wide parameter range.\n", "  Variations of total solar irradiance (TSI), magnetic field, Ca II K-flux,\nfaculae and plage areas due to the number and the type of sunspots/sunspot\ngroups (SGs) are well established by using Solar Irradiance Platform and ground\nbased data from various centers such as Stanford Data (SFO), Kodaikanal data\n(KKL) and National Geographical Data Center (NGDC) Homepage, respectively. We\napplied time series analysis for extracting the data over the descending phases\nof solar activity cycles (SACs) 21, 22 and 23, and the ascending phases 22 and\n23 of SACs, and analyzed the selected data using the Python programming\nlanguage. Our detailed analysis results suggest that there is a stronger\ncorrelation between solar surface indices and the changes in the relative\nportion of the small and large SGs. This somewhat unexpected finding suggest\nthat plage regions decreased in a lower values in spite of the higher number of\nlarge SGs in SAC 23 while Ca II K-flux did not decrease by large amount or it\nwas comparable with SAC 22 for some years and relates with C type and DEF type\nSGs. Thus, increase of facular areas which are influenced by large SGs caused a\nsmall percentage decrease in TSI while decrement of plage areas triggered a\nhigher decrease in the flux of magnetic field. Our results thus reveal the\npotential of such detailed comparison of SG analysis with solar surface indices\nfor understanding and predicting future trends in the SAC.\n", "  The entire form of the amplitude of three SYM ( involving two transverse\nscalar fields, a gauge field) and a potential $C_{n-1}$ Ramond-Ramond (RR) form\nfield is found out. We first derive $<V_{C^{-2}} V_{A^{0}} V_{\\phi ^{0}}\nV_{\\phi ^{0}}>$ and then start constructing an infinite number of $t,s$ channel\nbulk singularity structures by means of all order $\\alpha'$ corrections to\npull-back of brane in an Effective Field Theory (EFT). Due to presence of the\ncomplete form of S-matrix, several new contact interactions as well as new\ncouplings are explored. It is also shown that these couplings can be verified\nat the level of EFT by either the combinations of Myers terms, pull-back,\nTaylor expanded of scalar fields or the mixed combination of the couplings of\nthis paper as well as employed Bianchi identities. For the first time, we also\nderive the algebraic and the complete form of the integrations for some\narbitrary combinations of Mandelstam variables and for the most general case\n$\\int d^2z |1-z|^{a} |z|^{b} (z - \\bar{z})^{c} (z + \\bar{z})^{3}$ on upper half\nplane as well.\n", "  We investigate the quantum dynamics of monopole-like excitations in quantum\nsquare ice, as captured by the strongly anisotropic spin-1/2 XXZ model on the\ncheckerboard lattice. We obtain exact results for excitation dynamics in both\nanalytically solvable effective models and a fully interacting model of quantum\nsquare ice on finite clusters. We find that the dispersive lower bound of the\ndynamic response of freely propagating spinons is recovered in the dynamic\nstructure factor of the interacting system, yielding a marked fingerprint of\ncoherent spinon dispersion. Our results provide unbiased evidence for the\nformation of coherent quasiparticles propagating freely in the correlated\n\"vacuum\" of quantum square ice.\n", "  Theories of massive gravity with one or two dynamical metrics generically\nlack stable and observationally-viable cosmological solutions that are\ndistinguishable from $\\Lambda$CDM. We consider an extension to trimetric\ngravity, with three interacting spin-2 fields which are not plagued by the\nBoulware-Deser ghost. We systematically explore every combination with two free\nparameters in search of background cosmologies that are competitive with\n$\\Lambda$CDM. For each case we determine whether the expansion history\nsatisfies viability criteria, and whether or not it contains\nbeyond-$\\Lambda$CDM phenomenology. Among the many models we consider, there are\nonly three cases that seem to be both viable and distinguishable from standard\ncosmology. One of the models has only one free parameter and displays a\ncrossing from above to below the phantom divide. The other two provide scaling\nbehavior, although they contain future singularities that need to be studied in\nmore detail. These models possess interesting features that make them\ncompelling targets for a full comparison to observations of both cosmological\nexpansion history and structure formation.\n", "  We study the electronic properties of commensurate faulted bilayer graphene\nby diagonalizing the one-particle Hamiltonian of the bilayer system in a\ncomplete basis of Bloch states of the individual graphene layers. Our novel\napproach is very general and can be easily extended to any commensurate\ngraphene-based heterostructure. Here, we consider three cases: i) twisted\nbilayer graphene, ii) bilayer graphene where triaxial stress is applied to one\nlayer, and iii) bilayer graphene where uniaxial stress is applied to one layer.\nWe show that the resulting superstructures can be divided into distinct\nclasses, depending on the twist angle or the magnitude of the induced strain.\nThe different classes are distinguished from each other by the interlayer\ncoupling mechanism, resulting in fundamentally different low-energy physics.\nFor the cases of triaxial and uniaxial stress, the individual graphene layers\ntend to decouple and we find significant charge transfer between the layers. In\naddition, this piezoelectric effect can be tuned by applying a perpendicular\nelectric field. Finally, we show how our approach can be generalized to\nmultilayer systems.\n", "  We present two methods to determine whether the interactions in a\nTomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL) state of a spin-$1/2$ Heisenberg\nantiferromagnetic ladder are attractive or repulsive. The first method combines\ntwo bulk measurements, of magnetization and specific heat, to deduce the TLL\nparameter that distinguishes between the attraction and repulsion. The second\none is based on a local-probe, NMR measurements of the spin-lattice relaxation.\nFor the strong-leg spin ladder compound $\\mathrm{(C_7H_{10}N)_2CuBr_4}$ we find\nthat the isothermal magnetic field dependence of the relaxation rate,\n$T_1^{-1}(H)$, displays a concave curve between the two critical fields that\nbound the TLL regime. This is in sharp contrast to the convex curve previously\nreported for a strong-rung ladder $\\mathrm{(C_5H_{12}N)_2CuBr_4}$. Within the\nTLL description, we show that the concavity directly reflects the attractive\ninteractions, while the convexity reflects the repulsive ones.\n", "  In nonlinear dynamics, basins of attraction link a given set of initial\nconditions to its corresponding final states. This notion appears in a broad\nrange of applications where several outcomes are possible, which is a common\nsituation in neuroscience, economy, astronomy, ecology and many other\ndisciplines. Depending on the nature of the basins, prediction can be difficult\neven in systems that evolve under deterministic rules. From this respect, a\nproper classification of this unpredictability is clearly required. To address\nthis issue, we introduce the basin entropy, a measure to quantify this\nuncertainty. Its application is illustrated with several paradigmatic examples\nthat allow us to identify the ingredients that hinder the prediction of the\nfinal state. The basin entropy provides an efficient method to probe the\nbehavior of a system when different parameters are varied. Additionally, we\nprovide a sufficient condition for the existence of fractal basin boundaries:\nwhen the basin entropy of the boundaries is larger than $\\log 2 $, the basin is\nfractal.\n", "  It has become standard practice to take the logarithmic growth of the scale\nfactor as a measure of the amount of inflation, despite the well-known fact\nthat this is only an approximation for the true amount of inflation required to\nsolve the horizon and flatness problems. The aim of this work is to show how\nthis approximation can be completely avoided using an alternative framework for\ninflation model building. We show that using the inverse Hubble radius as the\nkey dynamical parameter, the correct number of e-folding arises naturally as a\nmeasure of inflation. As an application, we present an interesting model in\nwhich the entire inflationary dynamics can be solved analytically and exactly,\nand, in special cases, reduces to the familiar class of power-law models.\n", "  The recent determination of the local value of the Hubble constant by Riess\net al, 2016 (hereafter R16) is now 3.3 sigma higher than the value derived from\nthe most recent CMB anisotropy data provided by the Planck satellite in a LCDM\nmodel. Here we perform a combined analysis of the Planck and R16 results in an\nextended parameter space, varying simultaneously 12 cosmological parameters\ninstead of the usual 6. We find that a phantom-like dark energy component, with\neffective equation of state $w=-1.29_{-0.12}^{+0.15}$ at 68 % c.l. can solve\nthe current tension between the Planck dataset and the R16 prior in an extended\n$\\Lambda$CDM scenario. On the other hand, the neutrino effective number is\nfully compatible with standard expectations. This result is confirmed when\nincluding cosmic shear data from the CFHTLenS survey and CMB lensing\nconstraints from Planck. However, when BAO measurements are included we find\nthat some of the tension with R16 remains, as also is the case when we include\nthe supernova type Ia luminosity distances from the JLA catalog.\n", "  K*-charmonium dissociation reactions in hadronic matter are studied in the\nBorn approximation, in the quark-interchange mechanism, and with a\ntemperature-dependent quark potential. We obtain the temperature dependence of\nunpolarized cross sections for K*-charmonium dissociation reactions which\nproduce charmed mesons and charmed strange mesons. We use the cross sections\nfor charmonium dissociation in collisions with pion, rho meson, kaon, vector\nkaon, and eta meson to calculate dissociation rates of charmonium with the five\ntypes of mesons. Because of the temperature dependence of the meson masses,\ndissociation cross sections, and meson distribution functions, the charmonium\ndissociation rates generally increase with the increase of temperature and\ndecrease with the increase of charmonium momentum from 2.2 GeV/c. We find that\nthe first derivative of the dissociation rate with respect to the charmonium\nmomentum is zero when the charmonium is at rest. While the eta + psi' and eta +\nchi_c dissociation reactions can be neglected, the J/psi, psi', and chi_c\ndissociation are caused by the collisions with pion, rho meson, kaon, vector\nkaon, and eta meson.\n", "  Following the long-lived qualitative-dynamics tradition of explaining\nbehavior in complex systems via the architecture of their attractors and\nbasins, we investigate the patterns of switching between qualitatively distinct\ntrajectories in a network of synchronized oscillators. Our system, consisting\nof nonlinear amplitude-phase oscillators arranged in a ring topology with\nreactive nearest neighbor coupling, is simple and connects directly to\nexperimental realizations. We seek to understand how the multiple stable\nsynchronized states connect to each other in state space by applying Gaussian\nwhite noise to each of the oscillators' phases. To do this, we first identify a\nset of locally stable limit cycles at any given coupling strength. For each of\nthese attracting states, we analyze the effect of weak noise via the covariance\nmatrix of deviations around those attractors. We then explore the noise-induced\nattractor switching behavior via numerical investigations. For a ring of three\noscillators we find that an attractor-switching event is always accompanied by\nthe crossing of two adjacent oscillators' phases. For larger numbers of\noscillators we find that the distribution of times required to stochastically\nleave a given state falls off exponentially, and we build an attractor\nswitching network out of the destination states as a coarse-grained description\nof the high-dimensional attractor-basin architecture.\n", "  We show that measurements of the rapidity dependence of transverse momentum\ncorrelations can be used to determine the characteristic time $\\tau_\\pi$ that\ndictates the rate of isotropization of the stress energy tensor, as well as the\nshear viscosity $\\nu = \\eta/sT$. We formulate methods for computing these\ncorrelations using second order dissipative hydrodynamics with noise. Current\ndata are consistent with $\\tau_\\pi/\\nu \\sim 10$, but targeted measurements can\nimprove this precision.\n", "  We argue that the degrees of freedom in a d-dimensional CFT can be\nre-organized in an insightful way by studying observables on the moduli space\nof causal diamonds (or equivalently, the space of pairs of timelike separated\npoints). This 2d-dimensional space naturally captures some of the fundamental\nnonlocality and causal structure inherent in the entanglement of CFT states.\nFor any primary CFT operator, we construct an observable on this space, which\nis defined by smearing the associated one-point function over causal diamonds.\nKnown examples of such quantities are the entanglement entropy of vacuum\nexcitations and its higher spin generalizations. We show that in holographic\nCFTs, these observables are given by suitably defined integrals of dual bulk\nfields over the corresponding Ryu-Takayanagi minimal surfaces. Furthermore, we\nexplain connections to the operator product expansion and the first law of\nentanglement entropy from this unifying point of view. We demonstrate that for\nsmall perturbations of the vacuum, our observables obey linear two-derivative\nequations of motion on the space of causal diamonds. In two dimensions, the\nlatter is given by a product of two copies of a two-dimensional de Sitter\nspace. For a class of universal states, we show that the entanglement entropy\nand its spin-three generalization obey nonlinear equations of motion with local\ninteractions on this moduli space, which can be identified with Liouville and\nToda equations, respectively. This suggests the possibility of extending the\ndefinition of our new observables beyond the linear level more generally and in\nsuch a way that they give rise to new dynamically interacting theories on the\nmoduli space of causal diamonds. Various challenges one has to face in order to\nimplement this idea are discussed.\n", "  The central goal of jet quenching studies in high-energy nuclear collisions\nis the characterization of those QCD medium properties that are accessible by\nthese probes. Most of the discussion in the last years has been focused on the\ndetermination of the jet quenching parameter, $\\hat q$. We present here an\nextraction of this parameter using data of inclusive particle suppression at\nRHIC and LHC energies for different centralities. Our approach consists of\nfitting a $K$ factor that quantifies the departure of this parameter from an\nideal estimate, $K\\equiv \\hat q/(2\\epsilon^{3/4})$, where $\\hat q$ is\ndetermined by the local medium quantities as provided by hydrodynamical\ncalculations. We find that this $K$ factor is larger at RHIC than at the LHC,\nas obtained already in previous analyses, but, surprisingly, it is almost\nindependent of the centrality of the collision. Taken at face value, the $K$\nfactor would not depend on the local properties of the medium as energy density\nor temperature, but on global collision quantities such as the center of mass\nenergy. This is a very intriguing, unexpected possibility for which we cannot\nyet provide a clear interpretation. We also comment on the limitations of the\nformalism that may affect this conclusion.\n", "  In this Chapter, we present some interesting properties of quantum walks on\nthe line. We concentrate our attention in the emergence of invariance and\nprovide some insights into the ultimate origin of the observed behavior. In the\nfirst part of the Chapter, we review the building blocks of the\nquantum-mechanical version of the standard random walk in one dimension. The\nmost distinctive difference between random and quantum walks is the replacement\nof the random coin in the former by the action of a unitary operator upon some\ninternal property of the later. We provide explicit expressions for the\nsolution to the problem when the most general form for the homogeneous unitary\noperator is considered, and we analyze several key features of the system as\nthe presence of symmetries or stationary limits. After that, we analyze the\nconsequences of letting the properties of the coin operator change from site to\nsite, and from time step to time step. In spite of this lack of homogeneity,\nthe probabilistic properties of the motion of the walker can remain unaltered\nif the coin variability is chosen adequately. Finally, we show how this\ninvariance can be connected to the gauge freedom of electromagnetism.\n", "  Evidence of the $K^+\\to\\mu^+\\nu\\bar\\nu\\nu$ decay was searched for using E949\nexperimental data with an exposure of $1.70\\times 10^{12}$ stopped kaons. The\ndata sample is dominated by the backgrond process $K^+\\to\\mu^+\\nu_\\mu\\gamma$.\nAn upper limit on the decay rate $\\Gamma(K^+\\to\\mu^+\\nu\\bar\\nu\\nu)< 2.4\\times\n10^{-6}\\Gamma(K^+\\to all)$ at 90% confidence level was set assuming the\nStandard Model muon spectrum. The data are presented in such a way as to allow\ncalculation of rates for any assumed $\\mu^+$ spectrum.\n", "  Using an expansion in large number of dimensions, taken to subleading orders,\nwe discuss several issues concerning the Gregory-Laflamme instabilities. We map\nout the phase diagram of neutral and charged black strings, and comment on the\npossible transition in the nature of the final state of the instability at\nhigher order in the 1/D expansion. We also discuss unstable black membranes,\nand show that in certain limits the preferred shape of the non-uniform phase is\na triangular lattice.\n", "  We theoretically study an emergent SU(2) symmetry which is suggested by\nrecent magneto-transport measurements, carried out near two electrons filling\nof a carbon nanotube quantum dot. It emerges in the case where the spin and\norbital Zeeman splittings cancel each other out for two of the one-particle dot\nlevels among four. Using the Wilson numerical renormalization group, we show\nthat a crossover from the SU(4) to SU(2) Fermi-liquid behavior occurs at two\nimpurity-electrons filling as magnetic field increases. We also find that the\nquasiparticles are significantly renormalized as the remaining two one-particle\nlevels move away from the Fermi level and are frozen at high magnetic fields.\nIn order to clarify how the ground state evolves during such a crossover, we\nalso reexamine the SU(N) Kondo singlet state for M impurity-electrons filling\nin the limit of strong exchange interactions. We show that the nondegenerate\nFermi-liquid fixed point of Nozi\\`{e}es and Blandin can be described as a\nbosonic Perron-Frobenius vector for M hard-core bosons, each of which consists\nof one impurity-electron and one conduction hole. This interpretation can also\nbe applied to the Fermi-liquid fixed-point without the SU(N) symmetry.\n", "  In this addendum, we consider the connection between certain $2d$ super-GCA,\nobtained from the parametric contractions of $2d$ SCFTs, which can describe the\nconstraint algebra of null spinning strings.\n", "  The gap between two component debris disks is often taken to be carved by\nintervening planets scattering away the remnant planetesimals. We employ N-body\nsimulations to determine how the time needed to clear the gap depends on the\nlocation of the gap and the mass of the planets. We invert this relation, and\nprovide an equation for the minimum planet mass, and another for the expected\nnumber of such planets, that must be present to produce an observed gap for a\nstar of a given age. We show how this can be combined with upper limits on the\nplanetary system from direct imaging non-detections (such as with GPI or\nSPHERE) to produce approximate knowledge of the planetary system.\n", "  We analyse the classical and quantum dynamics of a Bianchi I model in the\npresence of a small negative cosmological constant characterizing its evolution\nin term of the dust-time dualism. We demonstrate that in a canonical metric\napproach, the cosmological singularity is removed in correspondence to a\npositive defined value of the dust energy density. Furthermore, the quantum\nBig-Bounce is connected to the Universe turning point via a well-defined\nsemiclassical limit. Then we can reliably infer that the proposed scenario is\ncompatible with a cyclical Universe picture. We also show how, when the\ncontribution of the dust energy density is sufficiently high, the proposed\nscenario can be extended to the Bianchi IX cosmology and therefore how it can\nbe regarded as a paradigm for the generic cosmological model. Finally, we\ninvestigate the origin of the observed cut-off on the cosmological dynamics,\ndemonstrating how the Big-Bounce evolution can be mimicked by the same\nsemiclassical scenario, where the negative cosmological constant is replaced\nvia a polymer discretization of the Universe volume. A direct proportionality\nlaw between such two parameters is then established.\n", "  We study the holographic dual description of a superconductor in which the\ngravity sector consists of a Maxwell field and a charged scalar field which\nexcept its minimal coupling to gravity it is also coupled kinematically to\nEinstein tensor. As the strength of the new coupling is increased, the critical\ntemperature below which the scalar field condenses is lowering, the\ncondensation gap decreases faster than the temperature, the width of the\ncondensation gap is not proportional to the size of the condensate and at low\ntemperatures the condensation gap tends to zero for the strong coupling. These\neffects which are the result of the presence of the coupling of the scalar\nfield to the Einstein tensor in the gravity bulk, provide a dual description of\nimpurities concentration in a superconducting state on the boundary.\n", "  Using a data sample of 980 ${\\rm fb}^{-1}$ of $e^+e^-$ annihilation data\ntaken with the Belle detector operating at the KEKB asymmetric-energy $e^+e^-$\ncollider, we report the results of a study of excited $\\Xi_c$ states that\ndecay, via the emission of photons and/or charged pions, into $\\Xi_c^0$ or\n$\\Xi_c^+$ ground state charmed-strange baryons. We present new measurements of\nthe masses of all members of the $\\Xi_c^{\\prime}$, $\\Xi_c(2645)$,\n$\\Xi_c(2790)$, $\\Xi_c(2815)$, and $\\Xi_c(2980)$ isodoublets, measurements of\nthe intrinsic widths of those that decay strongly, and evidence of previously\nunknown transitions.\n", "  Over the last years, Projected Entangled Pair States have demonstrated great\npower for the study of many body systems, as they naturally describe ground\nstates of gapped many body Hamiltonians, and suggest a constructive way to\nencode and classify their symmetries. The PEPS study is not only limited to\nglobal symmetries, but has also been extended and applied for local symmetries,\nallowing to use them for the description of states in lattice gauge theories.\nIn this paper we discuss PEPS with a local, SU(2) gauge symmetry, and\ndemonstrate the use of PEPS features and techniques for the study of a simple\nfamily of many body states with a non-Abelian gauge symmetry. We present, in\nparticular, the construction of fermionic PEPS able to describe both two-color\nfermionic matter and the degrees of freedom of an SU(2) gauge field with a\nsuitable truncation.\n", "  We present an effectively global analytical asymptotic galactic dynamo\nsolution for the regular magnetic field of an axisymmetric thin disc in the\nsaturated state. This solution is constructed by combining two well-known types\nof local galactic dynamo solution, parameterized by the disc radius. Namely,\nthe critical (zero growth) solution obtained by treating the dynamo equation as\na perturbed diffusion equation is normalized using a non-linear solution that\nmakes use of the `no-$z$' approximation and the dynamical $\\alpha$-quenching\nnon-linearity. This overall solution is found to be reasonably accurate when\ncompared with detailed numerical solutions. It is thus potentially useful as a\ntool for predicting observational signatures of magnetic fields of galaxies. In\nparticular, such solutions could be painted onto galaxies in cosmological\nsimulations to enable the construction of synthetic polarized synchrotron and\nFaraday rotation measure (RM) datasets. Further, we explore the properties of\nour numerical solutions, and their dependence on certain parameter values. We\nillustrate and assess the degree to which numerical solutions based on various\nlevels of approximation, common in the dynamo literature, agree with one\nanother.\n", "  The X-ray source CXO J133815.6+043255 has counterparts in the UV, optical,\nand radio bands. Based on the multi-band investigations, it has been recently\nproposed by Kim et al. (2015) as a rarely-seen off-nucleus ultraluminous X-ray\n(ULX) source with a black hole mass of >= 10^4 solar mass in the nearby Seyfert\ngalaxy NGC 5252. To explore its radio properties at very high angular\nresolution, we performed very long-baseline interferometry (VLBI) observations\nwith the European VLBI Network (EVN) at 1.7 GHz. We find that the radio\ncounterpart is remarkably compact among the known ULXs. It does not show a\nresolved structure with a resolution of a few milliarcsecond (mas), and the\ntotal recovered flux density is comparable to that measured in earlier\nsub-arcsecond-resolution images. The compact radio structure, the relatively\nflat spectrum, and the high radio luminosity are consistent with a weakly\naccreting supermassive black hole in a low-luminosity active galactic nucleus.\nThe nucleus of NGC 5252 itself has similar radio properties. We argue that the\nsystem represents a relatively rare pair of active galactic nuclei, where both\ncomponents emit in the radio.\n", "  The blocking effect caused by the odd particle on the pairing properties of\nsystems with odd number of fermions at finite temperature interacting via the\nmonopole pairing force is studied within several approximations. The results\nare compared with the predictions obtained by using the exact solutions of the\npairing Hamiltonian. The comparison favors the approximation with the odd\nparticle occupying the top level, which is the closest to the Fermi surface and\nwhose occupation number decreases with increasing temperature.\n", "  Centaurs are minor planets orbiting between Jupiter and Neptune that have or\nhad crossing orbits with one or more giant planets. Recent observations and\nreinterpretation of previous observations have revealed the existence of ring\nsystems around 10199 Chariklo and 2060 Chiron. However, the origin of the ring\nsystems around such a minor planet is still an open question. Here, we propose\nthat the tidal disruption of a differentiated object that experiences a close\nencounter with a giant planet could naturally form diverse ring-satellite\nsystems around the Centaurs. During the close encounter, the icy mantle of the\npassing object is preferentially ripped off by the planet's tidal force and the\ndebris is distributed mostly within the Roche limit of the largest remnant\nbody. Assuming the existence of $20-50$wt% silicate core below the icy mantle,\na disk of particles is formed when the objects pass within $0.4-0.8$ of the\nplanet's Roche limit with the relative velocity at infinity $3-6$km s$^{-1}$\nand 8h initial spin period of the body. The resultant ring mass is $0.1-10$% of\nthe central object's mass. Such particle disks are expected to spread radially,\nand materials spreading beyond the Roche limit would accrete into satellite(s).\nOur numerical results suggest that ring formation would be a natural outcome of\nsuch extreme close encounters and Centaurs can naturally have such ring systems\nbecause they cross the orbits of the giant planets.\n", "  The Event Horizon Telescope is a global very-long baseline interferometer\ncapable of probing potential deviations from the Kerr metric, which is believed\nto provide the unique description of astrophysical black holes. Here we report\nan updated constraint on the quadrupolar deviation of Sagittarius A* within the\ncontext of a radiatively inefficient accretion flow model in a quasi-Kerr\nbackground. We also simulate near-future constraints obtainable by the\nforthcoming eight-station array and show that in this model already a one-day\nobservation can measure the spin magnitude to within $0.005$, the inclination\nto within $0.09^\\circ$, the position angle to within $0.04^\\circ$, and the\nquadrupolar deviation to within $0.005$ at $3\\sigma$ confidence. Thus, we are\nentering an era of high-precision strong gravity measurements.\n", "  The $\\mathbf{k \\cdot p}$ method is a successful approach to obtain band\nstructure, optical and transport properties of semiconductors, and it depends\non external parameters that are obtained either from experiments, tight binding\nor ab initio calculations. Despite the widespread use of the $\\mathbf{k \\cdot\np}$ method, a systematic analysis of the stability and the accuracy of its\nparameters is not usual in the literature. In this work, we report a\ntheoretical framework to determine the $\\mathbf{k \\cdot p}$ parameters from\nstate-of-the-art hybrid density functional theory including spin-orbit\ncoupling, providing a calculation where the gap and spin-orbit energy splitting\nare in agreement with the experimental values. The accuracy of the set of\nparameters is enhanced by fitting over several directions at once, minimizing\nthe overall deviation from the original data. This strategy allows us to\nsystematically evaluate the stability, preserving the accuracy of the\nparameters, providing a tool to determine optimal parameters for specific\nranges around the ${\\Gamma}$-point. To prove our concept, we investigate the\nzinc blende GaAs that shows results in excellent agreement with the most\nreliable data in the literature.\n", "  Recent developments in fundamental physics (in theory as well as in\ntechnology) provide novel capabilities for geodetic applications such as\nrefined observations of the Earth`s gravity field. We will focus on two new\nconcepts: one applies atomic interferometry for (satellite) gravimetry, the\nother uses clock measurements for observing potential values. In the first\ncase, gravity anomalies are determined by observing free-falling atoms (quantum\ngravimetry), such technique can also be applied for future gradiometric\nmeasurements in space. In the second case according to Einstein`s theory of\ngeneral relativity, frequency comparisons of highly precise optical clocks give\naccess to differences of the gravity potential, even over long distances\n(relativistic geodesy). Also laser interferometry between test masses in space\nwith nanometer accuracy belongs to these novel concepts. For the latter,\ntechnology developed for gravitational wave detection and successfully tested\nin the LISA/pathfinder mission is being prepared for geodetic measurements.\nThose concepts are recently elaborated in close cooperation between physicists\nand geodesists at the University of Hannover under the umbrella of the\nCollaborative Research Center SFB 1128 Relativistic geodesy and gravimetry with\nquantum sensors (geo-Q). We will give a few examples where geodesy will\npotentially benefit from these novel developments and show future perspectives.\n", "  Angular momentum projection is used to obtain eigen states of angular\nmomentum from general wave functions. Multi-configuration mixing calculation\nwith angular momentum projection is an important microscopic method in nuclear\nphysics. For accurate multi-configuration mixing calculation with angular\nmomentum projection, concentrated distribution of $z$ components $K$ of angular\nmomentum in the body-fixed frame ($K$-distribution) is favored. Orientation of\nwave functions strongly affects $K$-distribution. Minimization of variance of\n$\\hat{J}_z$ is proposed as an alignment method to obtain wave functions that\nhave concentrated $K$-distribution. Benchmark calculations are performed for\n$\\alpha$-$^{24}$Mg cluster structure, triaxially superdeformed states in\n$^{40}$Ar, and Hartree-Fock states of some nuclei. The proposed alignment\nmethod is useful and works well for various wave functions to obtain\nconcentrated $K$-distribution.\n", "  LISA Pathfinder is the technological demonstrator space mission for the\nfuture gravitational waves observatory in space eLISA, with the aim of measure\nthe differential acceleration between free-falling test masses orbiting in the\nsame apparatus at a level of 30 fm/s-2Hz-1/2 at 1 mHz. Because the satellite\ncan't follow the two masses at the same time, the second mass must be forced to\nfollow either the other one or the spacecraft. The actuation force applied to\ncompensate this effect introduces a dominant source of force noise in the\nmission noise budget at frequency near and below the mHz. The free-fall mode\nactuation control scheme has been designed to suppress this noise source and\navoid actuation instabilities: actuation is limited to brief periodic impulses,\nwith test masses in free fall in between two kicks. This actuation-free motion\nis then analyzed for the remaining sources of acceleration ultra noise. A\nfree-fall mode parallel testing has been successfully implemented on torsion\npendulum facility at the University of Trento and the results of the\nmeasurement campaign are ready to be shown and discussed. The implementation of\nthe data analysis algorithms to estimate the spectrum of the acceleration of\nthe controlled test mass, and the estimation of system parameters such as the\nforce gradients, stiffness terms, are also part of this work. The free-fall\nmode has been tested at the level of 2 fNm/Hz-1/2, at the frequencies of 1 mHz,\ncorresponding to an acceleration of about 100 fm /s-2 Hz-1/2. The ground tests\nhave nevertheless allowed to develop and test quantitatively this innovative\nmethod of noise reduction due to actuation noise, contributing to its\ndevelopment for the LISA Pathfinder mission.\n", "  We present radio observations of 18 MIPSGAL bubbles performed at 5 GHz (6 cm)\nwith the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array in configuration B and BnA. The\nobservations were aimed at understanding what kind of information\nhigh-resolution and high-sensitivity radio maps can supply on the circumstellar\nenvelopes of different kinds of evolved stars and what their comparison with\ninfrared images with similar resolution can tell us. We found that the 18\nbubbles can be grouped into five categories according to their radio\nmorphology. The three bubbles presenting a central point source in the radio\nimages all correspond to luminous blue variable star candidates. Eleven bubbles\nshow an elliptical shape and the total lack of a central object in the radio,\nand are likely associated with planetary nebulae. Under this assumption we\nderive their distance, their ionized mass and their distribution on the\nGalactic plane. We discuss the possibility that the MIPSGAL bubbles catalogue\n(428 objects) may contain a large fraction of all Galactic planetary nebulae\nlocated at a distance between 1.4 kpc and 6.9 kpc and lying in the MIPSGAL\nfield of view. Among the remaining bubbles we identify also a H II region and a\nproto-planetary nebula candidate.\n", "  PageRank centrality is used by Google for ranking web-pages to present search\nresult for a user query. Here, we have shown that PageRank value of a vertex\nalso depends on its intrinsic, non-network contribution. If the intrinsic,\nnon-network contributions of the vertices are proportional to their degrees or\nzeros, then their PageRank centralities become proportion to their degrees.\nSome simulations and empirical data are used to support our study. In addition,\nwe have shown that localization of PageRank centrality depends upon the same\nintrinsic, non-network contribution.\n", "  We discuss a study to evaluate the extent to which free-response questions\ncan be approximated by multiple-choice equivalents. Two carefully designed\nresearch-based multiple-choice questions were transformed into a free-response\nformat and administered on the final exam in a calculus-based introductory\nphysics course. The original multiple-choice questions were administered in\nanother, similar introductory physics course on the final exam. Our findings\nsuggest that carefully designed multiple-choice questions can reflect the\nrelative performance on the free-response questions while maintaining the\nbenefits of ease of grading and quantitative analysis, especially if the\ndifferent choices in the multiple-choice questions are weighted to reflect the\ndifferent levels of understanding that students display.\n", "  It is shown that continuous causal isomorphisms on two-dimensional Minkowski\nspacetime can be characterized by the invariance of wave equations.\n", "  LHCb recently announced the discovery of two exotic structures in the $J/\\psi\n+ p$ decay channel, which have been referred to as charmonium-pentaquark\nstates. Resolving between the models and clarifying the nature of the\ndiscovered hidden-charm pentaquark peaks, and possibly searching for similar\npeaks with other quantum numbers, requires further experimental studies. The\nstates were observed in the decay mode $J/\\psi+p$. Thus, it is natural to\nexpect that these pentaquarks can be produced in the photoproduction process\n$\\gamma+p\\to P_c\\to J/\\psi+p$ where these states will appear as s-channel\nresonances at photon energy around 10 GeV. The energy and luminosity of the\nCLAS12 photon beam permit the detailed studies of the production and decay\nproperties of the pentaquark resonances. By this reason the pentaquark search\nat Jefferson Laboratory looks extremely attractive.\n", "  General Relativity predicts that the emission close to a black hole must be\nlensed by its strong gravitational field, illuminating the last photon orbit.\nThis results in a dark circular area known as the black hole 'shadow'. The\nEvent Horizon Telescope (EHT) is a (sub)mm VLBI network capable of\nSchwarzschild-radius resolution on Sagittarius A* (or Sgr A*), the 4 million\nsolar mass black hole at the Galactic Center. The goals of the Sgr A*\nobservations include resolving and measuring the details of its morphology.\nHowever, EHT data are sparse in the visibility domain, complicating reliable\ndetailed image reconstruction. Therefore, direct pixel imaging should be\ncomplemented by other approaches. Using simulated EHT data from a black hole\nemission model we consider an approach to Sgr A* image reconstruction based on\na simple and computationally efficient analytical model that produces images\nsimilar to the synthetic ones. The model consists of an eccentric ring with a\nbrightness gradient and a two-dimensional Gaussian. These elemental forms have\nclosed functional representations in the visibility domain, which lowers the\ncomputational overhead of fitting the model to the EHT observations. For model\nfitting we use a version of the Markov chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) algorithm based\non the Metropolis-Hastings sampler with replica exchange. Over a series of\nsimulations we demonstrate that our model can be used for determining geometric\nmeasures of a black hole, thus providing information on the shadow size,\nlinking General Relativity with accretion theory.\n", "  An efficient algorithm for the reconstruction of the magnetization state\nwithin magnetic components is presented. The occurring inverse magnetostatic\nproblem is solved by means of an adjoint approach, based on the Fredkin-Koehler\nmethod for the solution of the forward problem. Due to the use of hybrid\nFEM-BEM coupling combined with matrix compression techniques the resulting\nalgorithm is well suited for large-scale problems. Furthermore the\nreconstruction of the magnetization state within a permanent magnet is\ndemonstrated.\n", "  The paper presents the study of the effect of a mesh refinement on numerical\nresults of 3D RANS computations of turbomachinery flows. The CFD solver F,\nwhich based on the second-order accurate ENO scheme, is used in this study. The\nsimplified multigrid algorithm and local time stepping permit decreasing\ncomputational time. The flow computations are performed for a number of turbine\nand compressor cascades and stages. In all flow cases, the successively refined\nmeshes of H-type with an approximate orthogonalization near the solid walls\nwere generated. The results obtained are compared in order to estimate their\nboth mesh convergence and ability to resolve the transonic flow pattern. It is\nconcluded that for thorough studying the fine phenomena of the 3D\nturbomachinery flows, it makes sense to use the computational meshes with the\nnumber of cells from several millions up to several hundred millions per a\nsingle turbomachinery blade channel, while for industrial computations, a mesh\nof about or less than one million cells per a single turbomachinery blade\nchannel could be sufficient under certain conditions.\n", "  Recent studies have shown that outflows in at least some broad absorption\nline (BAL) quasars are extended well beyond the putative dusty torus. Such\noutflows should be detectable in obscured quasars. We present four WISE\nselected infrared red quasars with very strong and peculiar ultraviolet Fe ii\nemission lines: strong UV Fe II UV arising from transitions to ground/low\nexcitation levels, and very weak Fe II at wavelengths longer than 2800 {\\AA}.\nThe spectra of these quasars display strong resonant emission lines, such as C\nIV, Al III and Mg II but sometimes, a lack of non-resonant lines such as C\nIII], S III and He II. We interpret the Fe II lines as resonantly scattered\nlight from the extended outflows that are viewed nearly edge-on, so that the\naccretion disk and broad line region are obscured by the dusty torus, while the\nextended outflows are not. We show that dust free gas exposed to strong\nradiation longward of 912 {\\AA} produces Fe II emission very similar to that\nobserved. The gas is too cool to collisionally excite Fe II lines, accounting\nfor the lack of optical emission. The spectral energy distribution from the UV\nto the mid-infrared can be modeled as emission from a clumpy dusty torus, with\nUV emission being reflected/scattered light either by the dusty torus or the\noutflow. Within this scenario, we estimate a minimum covering factor of the\noutflows from a few to 20% for the Fe II scattering region, suggesting that Fe\nII BAL quasars are at a special stage of quasar evolution.\n", "  We demonstrate a hybrid distributed fiber sensing system for multi-parameter\ndetection. The integration of phase-sensitive optical time domain reflectometry\n({\\Phi}-OTDR) and Brillouin optical time domain reflectometry (B-OTDR) enables\nmeasurement of vibration, temperature and strain. Exploiting the fast changing\nproperty of vibration and the static property of temperature and strain, the\nlaser pulse width and intensity are modulated and then injected into the\nsingle-mode sensing fiber proportionally, so that the three concerned\nparameters can be extracted simultaneously by only one photo-detector and data\nacquisition channel. Combining with advanced data processing methods, the\nmodulation of laser pulse brings additional advantages because of trade and\nbalance between the backscattering light power and nonlinear effect noise,\nwhich enhances the signal-to-noise ratio, and enables sub-meter level spatial\nresolution together with long sensing distance. The proposed method realizes up\nto 4.8 kHz vibration sensing with 3 m spatial resolution at 10 km standard\nsingle-mode fiber. And measurements of the distributed temperature and stress\nprofile along the same fiber with 80 cm spatial resolution are also achieved\nconcurrently.\n", "  The Kerr metric is known to present issues when trying to find an interior\nsolution. In this work we continue in our efforts to construct a more realistic\nexterior metric for astrophysical objects. A new approximate metric\nrepresenting the spacetime of a charged, rotating and slightly-deformed body is\nobtained by perturbing the Kerr-Newman metric to include the mass-quadrupole\nand quadrupole-quadrupole orders. It has a simple form, because is\nKerr-Newman-like. Its post-linear form without charge coincides with\npost-linear quadrupole-quadrupole metrics already found.\n", "  Superconductivity (SC) with the suppression of long-range antiferromagnetic\n(AFM) order is observed in the parent compounds of both iron-based and cuprate\nsuperconductors. The AFM wave vectors are bicollinear ($\\pi$, 0) in the parent\ncompound FeTe different from the collinear AFM order ($\\pi$, $\\pi$) in most\niron pnictides. Study of the phase diagram of Fe$_{1+y}$Te$_{1-x}$Se$_x$ is the\nmost direct way to investigate the competition between bicollinear AFM and SC.\nHowever, presence of interstitial Fe affects both magnetism and SC of\nFe$_{1+y}$Te$_{1-x}$Se$_x$, which hinders the establishment of the real phase\ndiagram. Here, we report the comparison of doping-temperature ($x$-$T$) phase\ndiagrams for Fe$_{1+y}$Te$_{1-x}$Se$_x$ (0 $\\leq$ $x$ $\\leq$ 0.43) single\ncrystals before and after removing interstitial Fe. Without interstitial Fe,\nthe AFM state survives only for $x$ $<$ 0.05, and bulk SC emerges from $x$ =\n0.05, and does not coexist with the AFM state. The previously reported spin\nglass state, and the coexistence of AFM and SC may be originated from the\neffect of the interstitial Fe. The phase diagram of Fe$_{1+y}$Te$_{1-x}$Se$_x$\nis found to be similar to the case of the \"1111\" system such as\nLaFeAsO$_{1-x}$F$_x$, and is different from that of the \"122\" system.\n", "  In two dimensional turbulence, vortex thinning process is one of the\nattractive mechanism to explain inverse energy cascade in terms of vortex\ndynamics. By direct numerical simulation to the two-dimensional Navier-Stokes\nequations with small-scale forcing and large-scale damping, Xiao-Wan-Chen-Eyink\n(2009) found an evidence that inverse energy cascade may proceed with the\nvortex thinning mechanism. The aim of this paper is to analyze the\nvortex-thinning mechanism mathematically (using the incompressible Euler\nequations), and give a mathematical evidence that large-scale vorticity gains\nenergy from small-scale vorticity due to the vortex-thinning process.\n", "  In this paper, we investigate the physical mechanisms underlying one of the\nmost efficient filtration devices: the kidney. Building on a minimal model of\nthe Henle loop - the central part of the kidney filtration - we investigate\ntheoretically the detailed out-of-equilibrium fluxes in this separation process\nin order to obtain absolute theoretical bounds for its efficiency in terms of\nseparation ability and energy consumption. We demonstrate that this separation\nprocess operates at a remarkably small energy cost as compared to traditional\nsieving processes while working at much smaller pressures. This unique\nenergetic efficiency originates in the double-loop geometry of the nephron,\nwhich operates as an active osmotic exchanger. The principles for an\nartificial-kidney-inspired filtration device could be readily mimicked based on\nexisting soft technologies to build compact and low-energy artificial dialytic\ndevices. Such a \"kidney on a chip\" also points to new avenues for advanced\nwater recycling, targeting, in particular, sea-water pretreatment for\ndecontamination and hardness reduction.\n", "  Aims. The magnetic field of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) determines their\nstructure, evolution, and energetics, as well as their geoeffectiveness.\nHowever, we currently lack routine diagnostics of the near-Sun CME magnetic\nfield, which is crucial for determining the subsequent evolution of CMEs.\nMethods. We recently presented a method to infer the near-Sun magnetic field\nmagnitude of CMEs and then extrapolate it to 1 AU. This method uses relatively\neasy to deduce observational estimates of the magnetic helicity in CME-source\nregions along with geometrical CME fits enabled by coronagraph observations. We\nhereby perform a parametric study of this method aiming to assess its\nrobustness. We use statistics of active region (AR) helicities and CME\ngeometrical parameters to determine a matrix of plausible near-Sun CME magnetic\nfield magnitudes. In addition, we extrapolate this matrix to 1 AU and determine\nthe anticipated range of CME magnetic fields at 1 AU representing the radial\nfalloff of the magnetic field in the CME out to interplanetary (IP) space by a\npower law with index aB. Results. The resulting distribution of the near-Sun\n(at 10 Rs ) CME magnetic fields varies in the range [0.004, 0.02] G, comparable\nto, or higher than, a few existing observational inferences of the magnetic\nfield in the quiescent corona at the same distance. We also find that a\ntheoretically and observationally motivated range exists around aB = -1.6\n+-0.2, thereby leading to a ballpark agreement between our estimates and\nobservationally inferred field magnitudes of magnetic clouds (MCs) at L1.\nConclusions. In a statistical sense, our method provides results that are\nconsistent with observations.\n", "  We present spectroscopic measurements on the night sky of Xinglong\nObservatory for a period of 12 years from 2004 to 2015. The spectra were\nobtained on moonless clear nights using the OMR spectrograph mounted on a\n2.16-m reflector with a wavelength coverage of 4000-7000A. The night sky\nspectrum shows the presence of emission lines from Hg I and Na I due to local\nartificial sources, along with the atmospheric emission lines, i.e., O I and OH\nmolecules, indicating the existence of light pollution. We have monitored the\nnight sky brightness during the whole night and found some decrement in the sky\nbrightness with time, but the change is not significant. Also, we monitored the\nlight pollution level in different azimuthal directions and found that the\ninfluence of light pollution from the direction of Beijing is stronger compared\nwith that from the direction of Tangshan and other areas. An analysis of night\nsky spectra for the entire data set suggested that the zenith sky brightness of\nXinglong Observatory has brightened by about 0.5 mag arcsec -2 in the V and B\nbands from 2004 to 2015. We recommend consecutive spectroscopic measurements of\nthe night sky brightness at Xinglong Observatory in the future, not only for\nmonitoring but also for scientific reference.\n", "  This is a contribution to the proceedings of the 2016 \"Loops and legs\"\nconference, based on the talk by HF. The talk was based on the paper \"On the\nreduction of Generalized Polylogarithms to $\\text{Li}_n$ and $\\text{Li}_{2,2}$\nand on the reduction thereof\" by the three authors, published in March 2016 in\nJHEP.\n", "  The community deception problem is about how to hide a target community C\nfrom community detection algorithms. The need for deception emerges whenever a\ngroup of entities (e.g., activists, police enforcements) want to cooperate\nwhile concealing their existence as a community. In this paper we introduce and\nformalize the community deception problem. To solve this problem, we describe\nalgorithms that carefully rewire the connections of C's members. We\nexperimentally show how several existing community detection algorithms can be\ndeceived, and quantify the level of deception by introducing a deception score.\nWe believe that our study is intriguing since, while showing how deception can\nbe realized it raises awareness for the design of novel detection algorithms\nrobust to deception techniques.\n", "  Daily rainfall extremes and annual totals have increased in large parts of\nthe global land area over the last decades. These observations are consistent\nwith theoretical considerations of a warming climate. However, until recently\nthese global tendencies have not been shown to consistently affect land regions\nwith limited moisture availability. A recent study, published by Donat et al.\n(2016, Nature Climate Change, doi:10.1038/nclimate2941), now identified rapid\nincreases in globally aggregated dry region daily extreme rainfall and annual\nrainfall totals. Here, we reassess the respective analysis and find that a)\nstatistical artifacts introduced by the choice of the reference period prior to\ndata standardization lead to an overestimation of the reported trends by up to\n40%, and also that b) the definition of `dry regions of the globe' affect the\nreported globally aggregated trends in extreme rainfall. Using the same\nobservational dataset, but accounting for the statistical artifacts and using\nalternative, well-established dryness definitions, we find no significant\nincreases in heavy precipitation in the world's dry regions. Adequate data\npre-processing approaches and accounting for uncertainties regarding the\ndefinition of dryness are crucial to the quantification of spatially aggregated\ntrends in the world's dry regions. In view of the high relevance of the\nquestion to many potentially affected stakeholders, we call for a cautionary\nconsideration of specific data processing methods, including issues related to\nthe definition of dry areas, to guarantee robustness of communicated climate\nchange relevant findings.\n", "  We estimate expression for velocity as a function of the radial coordinate\n$r$ by using polynomial interpolation based on the experimental data of\nrotational velocities at distant outer regions of galaxies. The interpolation\ntechnique has been used to estimate fifth degree polynomial followed by cubic\nspline interpolation. This rotational velocity is used to find the geometry of\ngalactic halo regions within the framework of Einstein's general relativity. In\nthis letter we have analyzed features of galactic halo regions based on two\npossible choices for the dark matter density profile, viz. Navarro, Frenk \\&\nWhite (NFW) type~\\citep{Navarro1996} and Universal Rotation Curve (URC)\n~\\citep{Castignani2012}. It is argued that spacetime of the galactic halo\npossesses some of the characteristics needed to support traversable wormholes.\n", "  We describe a method to track particles undergoing large displacements.\nStarting with a list of particle positions sampled at different time points, we\nassign particle identities by minimizing the sum across all particles of the\ntrace of the square of the strain tensor. This method of tracking corresponds\nto minimizing the stored energy in an elastic solid or the dissipated energy in\na viscous fluid. Our energy-minimizing approach extends the advantages of\nparticle tracking to situations where particle imaging velocimetry and digital\nimaging correlation are typically required. This approach is much more reliable\nthan the standard squared-displacement minimizing approach for\nspatially-correlated displacements that are larger than the typical\ninterparticle spacing. Thus, it is suitable for particles embedded in a\nmaterial undergoing large deformations. On the other hand, squared-displacement\nminimization is more effective for particles undergoing uncorrelated random\nmotion. In the Supplement, we include a flexible MATLAB particle tracker that\nimplements either approach. This implementation returns an estimation of the\nstrain tensor for each particle, in addition to its identification.\n", "  The main advantage of Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detector arrays (MKID) is\ntheir multiplexing capability, which allows for building cameras with a large\nnumber of pixels and good sensitivity, particularly suitable to perform large\nblank galaxy surveys. However, to have as many pixels as possible it is\nnecessary to arrange detectors close in readout frequency. Consequently KIDs\noverlap in frequency and are coupled to each other producing crosstalk. Because\ncrosstalk can be only minimised by improving the array design, in this work we\naim to correct for this effect a posteriori. We analysed a MKID array\nconsisting of 880 KIDs with readout frequencies at 4-8 GHz. We measured the\nbeam patterns for every detector in the array and described the response of\neach detector by using a two-dimensional Gaussian fit. Then, we identified\ndetectors affected by crosstalk above -30 dB level from the maximum and removed\nthe signal of the crosstalking detectors. Moreover, we modelled the crosstalk\nlevel for each KID as a function of the readout frequency separation starting\nfrom the assumption that the transmission of a KID is a Lorenztian function in\npower. We were able to describe the general crosstalk level of the array and\nthe crosstalk of each KID within 5 dB, so enabling the design of future arrays\nwith the crosstalk as a design criterion. In this work, we demonstrate that it\nis possible to process MKID images a posteriori to decrease the crosstalk\neffect, subtracting the response of each coupled KID from the original map.\n", "  We present results for the $x$ dependence of the unpolarized, helicity, and\ntransversity isovector quark distributions in the proton using lattice QCD,\nemploying the method of quasi-distributions proposed by Ji in 2013. Compared to\na previous calculation by us, the errors are reduced by a factor of about 2.5.\nMoreover, we present our first results for the polarized sector of the proton,\nwhich indicate an asymmetry in the proton sea in favor of the $u$ antiquarks\nfor the case of helicity distributions, and an asymmetry in favor of the $d$\nantiquarks for the case of transversity distributions.\n", "  In the centre of our galaxy lies a super-massive black hole, identified with\nthe radio source Sagittarius A*. This black hole has an estimated mass of\naround 4 million solar masses. Although Sagittarius A* is quite dim in terms of\ntotal radiated energy, having a luminosity that is a factor of $10^{10}$ lower\nthan its Eddington luminosity, there is now compelling evidence that this\nsource was far brighter in the past. Evidence derived from the detection of\nreflected X-ray emission from the giant molecular clouds in the galactic centre\nregion. However, the interpretation of the reflected emission spectra cannot be\ndone correctly without detailed modelling of the reflection process. Attempts\nto do so can lead to an incorrect interpretation of the data. In this paper we\npresent the results of a Monte Carlo simulation code we developed in order to\nfully model the complex processes involved in the emerging reflection spectra.\nThe simulated spectra can be compared to real data in order to derive model\nparameters and constrain the past activity of the black hole. In particular we\napply our code to observations of Sgr B2, in order to constrain the position\nand density of the cloud and the incident luminosity of the central source. The\nresults of the\n", "  The planetary nebula (PN) stage is the ultimate fate of stars with mass 1 to\n8 solar masses (M$_\\odot$). The origin of their complex morphologies is poorly\nunderstood, although several mechanisms involving binary interaction have been\nproposed. In close binary systems, the orbital separation is short enough for\nthe primary star to overfill its Roche lobe as it expands during the Asymptotic\nGiant Branch (AGB) phase. The excess material ends up forming a common-envelope\n(CE) surrounding both stars. Drag forces would then result in the envelope\nbeing ejected into a bipolar PN whose equator is coincident with the orbital\nplane of the system. Systems in which both stars have ejected their envelopes\nand evolve towards the white dwarf (WD) stage are called double-degenerates.\nHere we report that Henize 2-428 has a double-degenerate core with a combined\nmass unambiguously above the Chandrasekhar limit of 1.4 M$_\\odot$. According to\nits short orbital period (4.2 hours) and total mass (1.76 M$_\\odot$), the\nsystem should merge in 700 million years, triggering a Type Ia supernova (SN\nIa) event. This finding supports the double-degenerate, super-Chandrasekhar\nevolutionary channel for the formation of SNe Ia.\n", "  We investigate heavy-light four-quark systems $ud\\bar b \\bar b$ with bottom\nquarks of finite mass which are treated in the framework of NRQCD. We focus on\n$I(J^P)=0(1^+)$, where we recently found evidence for the existence of a\ntetraquark state using static bottom quarks. Furthermore, we report on an\ninvestigation of the $u \\bar d b \\bar b$ four-quark system with quantum numbers\n$I(J^P)=1(1^+)$ again using static bottom quarks.\n", "  We consider the massive Klein-Gordon equation on asymptotically Minkowski\nspacetimes, in the sense that the manifold is $R^{1+d}$ and the metric\napproaches that of Minkowski space at infinity in a short-range way (jointly in\ntime and space variables). In this setup we define Feynman and anti-Feynman\nscattering data and prove the Fredholm property of the Klein-Gordon operator\nwith the associated Atiyah-Patodi-Singer type boundary conditions at infinite\ntimes. We then construct a parametrix (with compact remainder terms) for the\nFredholm problem and prove that it is also a Feynman parametrix in the sense of\nDuistermaat and H\\\"ormander.\n", "  This paper continues our studies in arXiV:1608.06452 [hep-th] of ${\\cal N}=1$\ngauge theories in the strongly coupled regimes. We also consider here the\n${\\cal N}=1$ SQCD-like theories with $SU(N_c)$ colors (and their Seiberg's\ndual), with $N_F$ flavors of light quarks and $N_F^2$ additional colorless\nflavored scalars $\\Phi^j_i$, but now with $N_F$ in the range $N_F>3N_c$.\n  The mass spectra of these direct and dual theories in various vacua are\ncalculated within the dynamical scenario introduced by the author in [8]. It\nassumes that quarks in such ${\\cal N}=1$ SQCD-like theories without elementary\ncolored adjoint scalars can be in two {\\it standard} phases only. These are\neither the HQ (heavy quark) phase where they are confined or the Higgs phase.\nRecall that this scenario satisfies all those tests which were used as checks\nof the Seiberg hypothesis about the equivalence of the direct and dual\ntheories. Calculated mass spectra of the direct $SU(N_c)$ theory are compared\nto those of its Seiberg's dual $SU(N_F-N_c)$ variant and appeared to be\nparametrically different.\n", "  The paper reports optical orientation experiments performed in the narrow\nGaAs/AlGaAs quantum wells doped with Mn. We experimentally demonstrate a\ncontrol over the spin polarization by means of the optical orientation via the\nimpurity-to-band excitation and observe a sign inversion of the luminescence\npolarization depending on the pump power. The g factor of a hole localized on\nthe Mn acceptor in the quantum well was also found to be considerably modified\nfrom its bulk value due to the quantum confinement effect. This finding shows\nthe importance of the local environment on magnetic properties of the dopants\nin semiconductor nanostructures.\n", "  We describe a surface structure consisting of a metal-air interface where the\nmetallic part consists of two metallic segments with a periodic modulation of\nthe interface between them. Such a structure possesses a different\ntransmissivity for a surface plasmon polariton incident on it from one side of\nit than it has for a surface plasmon polariton incident on it from the opposite\nside. This asymmetric transmission of a surface plasmon polariton is based on\nthe suppression of the zero-order Bragg beam which, for a certain value of the\nmodulation depth, is not transmitted through the structure, while the\ndiffraction efficiencies of the +1 and -1 Bragg beams can be modified by\nvarying the period of grating and/or the angle of incidence. For a certain\nrange of the incidence angle one can observe asymmetry in transmittance for the\n-1 mode while the +1 mode is completely suppressed. By varying the material and\ngeometrical parameters of the diffractive structure one can control the\ncontrast transmission that characterizes the degree of the asymmetry. This\nproperty of the structure is demonstrated by the results of computer simulation\ncalculations.\n", "  We demonstrate how weak hybridization can lead to apparent heavy doping of 2d\nmaterials even in case of physisorptive binding. Combining ab-intio\ncalculations and a generic model we show that strong reshaping of Fermi\nsurfaces and changes in Fermi volumes on the order of several 10$\\%$ can arise\nwithout actual charge transfer. This pseudodoping mechanism is very generically\neffective in metallic 2d materials either weakly absored to metallic substrates\nor embedded in vertical heterostructures. It can explain strong apparent doping\nof TaS2 on Au (111) observed in recent experiments. Consequences of\npseudodoping for many-body instabilities are discussed.\n", "  The acronym IBIC (Ion Beam Induced Charge) was coined in early 1990's to\nindicate a scanning microscopy technique which uses MeV ion beams as probes to\nimage the basic electronic properties of semiconductor materials and devices.\nSince then, IBIC has become a widespread analytical technique to characterize\nmaterials for electronics or for radiation detection, as testified by more than\n200 papers published so far in peer-reviewed journals. Its success stems from\nthe valuable information IBIC can provide on charge transport phenomena\noccurring in finished devices, not easily obtainable by other analytical\ntechniques. However, IBIC analysis requires a robust theoretical background to\ncorrectly interpret experimental data. In order to illustrate the importance of\nusing a rigorous mathematical formalism, we present in this paper a benchmark\nIBIC experiment aimed to test the validity of the interpretative model based on\nthe Gunn's theorem and to provide an example of the analytical capability of\nIBIC to characterize semiconductor devices.\n", "  In this paper we study the abilities of an atmospherical mesoscale model in\nforecasting the classical atmospherical parameters relevant for astronomical\napplications at the surface layer (wind speed, wind direction, temperature,\nrelative humidity) on the Large Binocular Telescope (LBT) site - Mount Graham,\nArizona. The study is carried out in the framework of the ALTA project aiming\nat implementing an automated system for the forecasts of atmospherical\nparameters (Meso-Nh code) and the optical turbulence (Astro-Meso-Nh code) for\nthe service-mode operation of the LBT. The final goal of such an operational\ntool is to provide predictions with high time frequency of atmospheric and\noptical parameters for an optimized planning of the telescope operation (dome\nthermalization, wind-dependent dome orientation, observation planning based on\npredicted seeing, adaptive optics optimization, etc...). Numerical simulations\nare carried out with the Meso-Nh and Astro-Meso-Nh codes, which were proven to\ngive excellent results in previous studies focused on the two ESO sites of\nCerro Paranal and Cerro Armazones (MOSE Project). In this paper we will focus\nour attention on the comparison of atmospherical parameters forescasted by the\nmodel close to the ground with measurements taken by the observatory\ninstrumentations and stored in the LBT telemetry in order to validate the\nnumerical predictions. As previously done for Cerro Paranal (Lascaux et al.,\n2015), we will also present an analysis of the model performances based on the\nmethod of the contingency tables, that allows us to provide complementary key\ninformation with the respect to the bias and RMSE (systematic and statistical\nerrors), such as the percentage of correct detection and the probability to\nobtain a correct detection inside a defined interval of values.\n", "  In this contribution we study the prospects of measuring double Higgs\nproduction at a potential 100 TeV future circular collider. We apply an\nanalysis procedure that utilises reconstructed Higgs pairs from multiple final\nstate event topologies in order to maintain high selection efficiencies. Signal\npurity is then further improved by means of a artificial neural network\nclassifier. The results of this analysis for the high luminosity LHC show\nsignificant potential, however when applied to a 100 TeV hadron collider we\nfind that such a measurement is likely to suffer from a very poor signal to\nbackground ratio. Such a measurement at the FCC is therefore likely to be\nsignificantly more challenging than at the high luminosity phase of the LHC.\n", "  A focused ion beam is used to mill side holes in air-silica structured\nfibres. By way of example, side holes are introduced in two types of\nair-structured fibres (1) a photonic crystal four-ring fibre and (2) a 6-hole\nsingle ring step index structured fibre.\n", "  A simple method is outlined for analytic evaluation of the basic 2-electron\natomic integral with integrand containing products of atomic s-type Slater\norbitals and exponentially correlated function of the form $r_{ij}\nexp(-\\lambda_{ij}r_{ij})$, by employing the Fourier representation of\n$exp(-\\lambda_{ij}r_{ij})/r_{ij}$ without the use of either the spherical\nharmonic addition theorem or the Feynman technique. This method is applied to\nobtain closed-form expressions, in a simple manner, for certain other 2-,3- and\n4-electron atomic integrals with integrands which are products of exponentially\ncorrelated functions and atomic s-type Slater orbitals.\n", "  Zeeman-Doppler imaging studies have revealed the complexity of the\nlarge-scale magnetic fields of accreting pre-main-sequence stars. All have\nmultipolar magnetic fields with the octupole component being the dominant field\nmode for many of the stars studied thusfar. Young accreting stars with fully\nconvective interiors often feature simple axisymmetric magnetic fields with\ndipole components of order a kilo-Gauss (at least those of mass\n$\\gtrsim0.5\\,{\\rm M}_\\odot$), while those with substantially radiative\ninteriors host more complex non-axisymmetric magnetic fields with dipole\ncomponents of order a few 0.1 kilo-Gauss. Here, via several simple examples, we\ndemonstrate that i). in most cases, the dipole component alone can be used to\nestimate the disk truncation radius (but little else); ii) due the presence of\nhigher order magnetic field components, the field strength in the accretion\nspots is far in excess of that expected if a pure dipole magnetic field is\nassumed. (Fields of $\\sim$6$\\,{\\rm kG}$ have been measured in accretion\nspots.); iii) if such high field strengths are taken to be representative of\nthe polar strength of a dipole magnetic field, the disk truncation radius would\nbe overestimated. The effects of multipolar magnetic fields must be considered\nin both models of accretion flow and of accretion shocks.\n", "  This paper elaborates on relationalism about space and time as motivated by a\nminimalist ontology of the physical world: there are only matter points that\nare individuated by the distance relations among them, with these relations\nchanging. We assess two strategies to combine this ontology with physics, using\nclassical mechanics as example: the Humean strategy adopts the standard,\nnon-relationalist physical theories as they stand and interprets their formal\napparatus as the means of bookkeeping of the change of the distance relations\ninstead of committing us to additional elements of the ontology. The\nalternative theory strategy seeks to combine the relationalist ontology with a\nrelationalist physical theory that reproduces the predictions of the standard\ntheory in the domain where these are empirically tested. We show that, as\nthings stand, this strategy cannot be accomplished without compromising a\nminimalist relationalist ontology.\n", "  We report on the Raman and photoluminescence characterization of\nthree-dimensional microstructures created in single crystal diamond with a\nFocused Ion Beam (FIB) assisted lift-off technique. The method is based on MeV\nion implantation to create a buried etchable layer, followed by FIB patterning\nand selective etching. In the applications of such microstructures where the\nproperties of high quality single crystal diamond are most relevant, residual\ndamage after the fabrication process represents a critical technological issue.\nThe results of Raman and photoluminescence characterization indicate that the\npartial distortion of the sp3-bonded lattice and the formation of isolated\npoint defects are effectively removed after thermal annealing, leaving low\namounts of residual damage in the final structures. Three-dimensional\nmicrostructures in single-crystal diamond offer a large range of applications,\nsuch as quantum optics devices and fully integrated opto mechanical assemblies.\n", "  {\\bf Background:} Level sequences of rotational character have been observed\nin several nuclei in the $A=60$ mass region. The importance of the\ndeformation-driving $\\pi f_{7/2}$ and $\\nu g_{9/2}$ orbitals on the onset of\nnuclear deformation is stressed.\\\\ {\\bf Purpose:} A measurement was performed\nin order to identify collective rotational structures in the relatively\nneutron-rich $^{62}$Ni isotope. \\\\ {\\bf Method:} The\n$^{26}$Mg($^{48}$Ca,2$\\alpha$4$n\\gamma$)$^{62}$Ni complex reaction at beam\nenergies between 275 and 320~MeV was utilized. Reaction products were\nidentified in mass ($A$) and charge ($Z$) with the Fragment Mass Analyzer (FMA)\nand $\\gamma$ rays were detected with the Gammasphere array. \\\\ {\\bf Results:}\nTwo collective bands, built upon states of single-particle character, were\nidentified and sizable deformation was assigned to both sequences based on the\nmeasured transitional quadrupole moments, herewith quantifying the deformation\nat high spin. \\\\ {\\bf Conclusions:} Based on Cranked Nilsson-Strutinsky\ncalculations and comparisons with deformed bands in the $A=60$ mass region, the\ntwo rotational bands are understood as being associated with configurations\ninvolving multiple $f_{7/2}$ protons and $g_{9/2}$ neutrons, driving the\nnucleus to sizable prolate deformation.\n", "  We show that the partition function of the multi-layer semi-discrete directed\npolymer converges in the intermediate disorder regime to the partition function\nfor the multi-layer continuum polymer introduced by O'Connell and Warren. This\nverifies, modulo a previously hidden constant, an outstanding conjecture\nproposed by Corwin and Hammond. A consequence is the identification of the KPZ\nline ensemble as logarithms of ratios of consecutive layers of the continuum\npartition function. Other properties of the continuum partition function, such\nas continuity, strict positivity and contour integral formulas to compute mixed\nmoments, are also identified from this convergence result. The proof uses a\ncoupling, which was first introduced by Quastel, Moreno Flores, and Remenik,\nand an extension of the methods used to prove similar results for purely\ndiscrete polymers.\n", "  We report on the systematic characterization of\nBa(Fe$_{0.92}$Co$_{0.08}$)$_2$As$_2$ epitaxial thin films on CaF$_2$ substrate\nin view of their possible use for superconducting electronic applications. By\nusing different and complementary techniques we studied the morphological\ncharacteristics of the surface, the structural properties, the magnetic\nresponse, and the superconducting properties in terms of critical temperature,\ncritical current, and energy gaps. Particular attention was paid to the\nhomogeneity of the films and to the comparison of their superconducting\nproperties with those of single crystals of the same compound.\n", "  The interaction of electromagnetic radiation with a spheric-type\nthree-dimensional topological insulator (TI) bead is described within classical\noptics framework. By virtue of the topological magnetoelectric effect (TMEE)\nexperienced by reflected and transmitted rays at the TI surface, there appears\na net constant force on the spherical bead which is proportional to the fine\nstructure constant times the incident radiation power. Such an uniform dynamics\n(constant acceleration) may be particularly useful for optical tweeezing\ntechniques, for instance, to investigate a DNA strip or a membrane piece under\nstretching as well as to displace a tiny object by means of purely optical\ncontrol.\n", "  Cuba is continuing attracting the attention of the international scientific\ncommunity for some important and unexpected achievements in applied science\nsuch as health biotechnology. They represent outcomes of the 1959 decision of\nCuba to develop an advanced scientific system in order to address the most\nurgent problems for the development of the country and to overcome the\ncondition of subalternity. This ambitious objective was tackled in a very\noriginal way, making a broad and wide-ranging recourse to every effective\nsupport and collaboration, with Soviet but also Western scientists and\ninstitutions, in addition to a peculiar Cuban inventiveness. Indeed,\nimmediately after the revolution, Cuba developed an advanced and articulated\nscientific system, and achieved a level of excellence in leading scientific\nfields, like biotechnology, quite independently from the Soviet Union, which\nwas behind in this field. Even the collapse of the Soviet Union in the early\n1990s, that could have put the achievements of the Revolution at risk, posing\nagain the threat of subalternity, under an intentionally worsened American\nembargo, did not change this trend: once more Cuba addressed this challenge\nreconfirming the strategic choice of supporting its most advanced and\nprofitable scientific sectors, especially the capital-intensive and typically\nAmerican field of health biotechnologies. This strategy proved to be once again\na well-chosen course of action.\n", "  We address the behavior of the Dirac equation with the Killingbeck radial\npotential including the external magnetic and Aharonov-Bohm (AB) flux fields.\nThe spin and pseudo-spin symmetries are considered. The correct bound state\nspectra and their corresponding wave functions are obtained. We seek such a\nsolution using the biconfluent Heun differential equation method. Further, we\ngive some of our results at the end of this study. Our final results can be\nreduced to their non-relativistic forms by simply using some appropriate\ntransformations. The spectra, in the spin and pseudo-spin symmetries, are very\nsimilar with a slight difference in energy spacing between different states.\n", "  The photospheric spatial distribution of the main magnetic polarities of\nbipolar active regions (ARs) presents during their emergence deformations are\nknown as magnetic tongues. They are attributed to the presence of twist in the\ntoroidal magnetic flux-tubes that form the ARs. The aim of this article is to\nstudy the twist of newly emerged ARs from the evolution of magnetic tongues\nobserved in photospheric line-of-sight magnetograms. We apply the procedure\ndescribed by Poisson et al. (2015, Solar Phys. 290, 727) to ARs observed over\nthe full Solar Cycle 23 and the beginning of Cycle 24. Our results show that\nthe hemispherical rule obtained using the tongues as a proxy of the twist has a\nweak sign-dominance (53 % in the southern hemisphere and 58 % in the northern\nhemisphere). By defining the variation of the tongue angle, we characterize the\nstrength of the magnetic tongues during different phases of the AR emergence.\nWe find that there is a tendency of the tongues to be stronger during the\nbeginning of the emergence and to become weaker as the AR reaches its maximum\nmagnetic flux. We compare this evolution with the emergence of a toroidal\nflux-rope model with non-uniform twist. The variety of evolution of the tongues\nin the analyzed ARs can only be reproduced when using a broad range of twist\nprofiles, in particular having a large variety of twist gradient in the\ndirection vertical to the photosphere. Although the analytical model used is a\nspecial case, selected to minimize the complexity of the problem, the results\nobtained set new observational constraints to theoretical models of flux-rope\nemergence that form bipolar ARs.\n", "  If a sufficiently advanced civilization can either modulate the emission from\nan X-ray binary, or make use of the natural high luminosity to power an\nartificial transmitter, these can serve as good beacons for interstellar\ncommunication without involving excessive energy costs to the broadcasting\ncivilization. In addition, the small number of X-ray binaries in the Galaxy\nconsiderably reduces the number of targets that must be investigated compared\nto searches in other energy bands. Low mass X-ray binaries containing neutron\nstars in particular are considered as prime potential natural and artificial\nbeacons and high time resolution (better than 1ms) observations are encouraged.\nAll sky monitors provide the capability of detecting brief powerful artificial\nsignals from isolated neutron stars. New capabilities of X-ray astronomy\nsatellites developed for astrophysical purposes are enabling SETI in new\nparameter regimes. For example, the X-ray Timing Explorer satellite provides\nthe capability of exploring the sub-millisecond region. Other planned X-ray\nastronomy satellites should provide significantly improved spectral resolution.\nWhile SETI at X-ray energies is highly speculative (and rather unfashionable)\nby using a parasitic approach little additional cost is involved. The inclusion\nof X-ray binaries in target lists for SETI at radio and other wavebands is also\nadvocated.\n", "  The mechanical, structural and functional properties of crystals are\ndetermined by their defects and the distribution of stresses surrounding these\ndefects has broad implications for the understanding of transport phenomena.\nWhen the defect density rises to levels routinely found in real-world\nmaterials, transport is governed by local stresses that are predominantly\nnonlinear. Such stress fields however, cannot be measured using conventional\nbulk and local measurement techniques. Here, we report direct and spatially\nresolved experimental measurements of the nonlinear stresses surrounding\ncolloidal crystalline defect cores, and show that the stresses at vacancy cores\ngenerate attractive interactions between them. We also directly visualize the\nsoftening of crystalline regions surrounding dislocation cores, and find that\nstress fluctuations in quiescent polycrystals are uniformly distributed rather\nthan localized at grain boundaries, as is the case in strained atomic\npolycrystals. Nonlinear stress measurements have important implications for\nstrain hardening, yield, and fatigue.\n", "  Self-heating in surrounding gate transistors can degrade its on-current\nperformance and reduce lifetime. If a transistor heats/cools with\ntime-constants less than the inverse of the operating frequency, a predictable,\nfrequency-independent performance is expected; if not, the signal pattern must\nbe optimized for highest performance. Typically, time-constants are measured by\nexpensive, ultra-fast instruments with high temporal resolution. Instead, here\nwe demonstrate an alternate, inexpensive, cyclostationary measurement technique\nto characterize self-heating (and cooling) with sub-microsecond resolution. The\nresults are independently confirmed by direct imaging of the transient\nheating/cooling of the channel temperature by the thermoreflectance (TR)\nmethod. A routine use of the proposed technique will help improve the\nsurrounding gate transistor design and shorten the design cycle.\n", "  Flame propagation through a non-volatile solid-fuel suspension is studied\nusing a simplified, time-dependent numerical model that considers the influence\nof both diffusional and kinetic rates on the particle combustion process. It is\nassumed that particles react via a single-step, first-order Arrhenius surface\nreaction with an oxidizer delivered to the particle surface through gas\ndiffusion. Unlike the majority of models previously developed for flames in\nsuspensions, no external parameters are imposed, such as particle ignition\ntemperature, combustion time, or the assumption of either kinetic- or\ndiffusion-limited particle combustion regimes. Instead, it is demonstrated that\nthese parameters are characteristic values of the flame propagation problem\nthat must be solved together with the burning velocity, and that the a priori\nimposition of these parameters from single-particle combustion data may result\nin erroneous predictions. It is also shown that both diffusive and kinetic\nreaction regimes can alternate within the same flame and that their interaction\nmay result in non-trivial flame behavior. In fuel-lean mixtures, it is\ndemonstrated that this interaction leads to certain particle size ranges where\nburning velocity increases with increasing particle size, opposite to the\nexpected trend. For even leaner mixtures, the interplay between kinetic and\ndiffusive reaction rates leads to the appearance of a new type of flame\ninstability where kinetic and diffusive regimes alternate in time, resulting in\na pulsating regime of flame propagation.\n", "  The variability of HD 240121 = BD+59 2602 was first suspected by S\\\"arg &\nWramdemark (1970) and later confirmed by Gr\\\"obel (1992a,b). Because of the\nobserved anti-phase variations of the B and V light curves, the latter author\ntentatively suggested an ACV type. Apart from its inclusion in the catalog of\nNew Suspected Variables (NSV 25977), no further investigations of the star have\nbeen published. HD 240121 was included into our target list of ACV candidates\nand investigated in order to determine the reason for the observed brightness\nvariations. All available information on HD 240121 were collected via an\nexhaustive data mining procedure. Data from Gr\\\"obel (1992a,b) were re-analysed\nand photometric observations from the NSVS and Hipparcos archives were procured\nand investigated. Line-of-sight reddening and stellar parameters were\ncalculated from archival photometric data. HD 240121 is a young, late B-type\nCP2 star of the silicon subgroup. The observed period, amplitude of light\nvariations and variability pattern (anti-phase variations) are typical of ACV\nvariables. The occurrence of anti-phase variations of the B and V light curves\nis rarely observed and points to the existence of a null wavelength in the\nvisual spectrum. We therefore strongly encourage further multi-colour\nphotometric observations of this star.\n"]}
