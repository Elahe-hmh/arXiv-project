"10.1103/PhysRevB.94.125118"], "abstract": ["  Since there are dark matter particles (neutrino) with mass about 10^(-1)eV in\nthe universe, the superstructures with a scale of 10^(19) solar mass [large\nnumber A is about 10^(19)] appeared around the era of the hydrogen\nrecombination. The redshift z distributions of quasars support the existence of\nsuperstructures. Since there are superstructures in the universe, it is not\nnecessary for the hypothesis of dark energy. While neutrino is related to\nelectro-weak field, the fourth stable elementary particles (delta particle)\nwith mass about 10^(0)eV to 10^(1)eV is related to gravitation-\"strong\" field,\nwhich suggests p + anti(p)--> n/anti(n) + anti(delta particle)/(delta particle)\nand that some new meta-stable baryons appeared near the TeV region. Therefore,\na twofold standard model diagram is proposed, and related to many experiment\nphenomena: The new meta-stable baryons' decays produce delta particles, which\nare helpful to explain the Dijet asymmetry phenomena at LHC of CERN, the\ndifferent results for the Fermilab's data peak, etc; However, according to the\n(B-L) invariance, the sterile \"neutrino\" from \"the event excess in MiniBooNe\"\ncan not be the fourth neutrino but rather the delta particle; We think that the\ndelta particles are related to the phenomenon about neutrinos FTL, and that\nanti-neutrinos are faster than neutrinos. FTL is also related to the cosmic\ninflation, singular point disappearance, and abnormal red shift of SN Ia. Some\nexperiments and observations are suggested. In the Extension section, we\nclarify \"mass tree\", our finite universe, cosmic dual expansions, dual SM etc.\nAnd the LHC can look for new particles with decay products graviton/delta\nparticle and new interaction indeed.\n", "  We calculate the probability distribution of the transmission eigenvalues T_n\nof Bogoliubov quasiparticles at the Fermi level in an ensemble of chaotic\nAndreev quantum dots. The four Altland-Zirnbauer symmetry classes (determined\nby the presence or absence of time-reversal and spin-rotation symmetry) give\nrise to four circular ensembles of scattering matrices. We determine P({T_n})\nfor each ensemble, characterized by two symmetry indices \\beta and \\gamma . For\na single d-fold degenerate transmission channel we thus obtain the distribution\nP(g) ~ g^{-1+\\beta /2}(1-g)^{\\gamma /2} of the thermal conductance g (in units\nof d \\pi ^2 k_B^2 T_0/6h at low temperatures T_0). We show how this\nsingle-channel limit can be reached using a topological insulator or\nsuperconductor, without running into the problem of fermion doubling.\n", "  The recent \"breakdown criterion\" result of S. Klainerman and I. Rodnianski\nstated roughly that an Einstein-vacuum spacetime, given as a CMC foliation, can\nbe further extended in time if the second fundamental form and the derivative\nof the lapse of the foliation are uniformly bounded. This theorem and its proof\nwere extended to Einstein-scalar and Einstein-Maxwell spacetimes in the\nauthor's Ph.D. thesis. In this paper, we state the main results of the thesis,\nand we summarize and discuss their proofs. In particular, we will discuss the\nvarious issues resulting from nontrivial Ricci curvature and the coupling\nbetween the Einstein and the field equations.\n", "  The Okubo [2]-Weiss [3] criterion is recast by using the 2D hydrodynamic\nBeltrami condition (Shivamoggi et al.[13]) that approximates the slow\nflow-variation ansatz imposed in its derivation. This turns out to provide an\ninteresting interpretation of the Okubo-Weiss criterion very logically in terms\nof the topological properties of the underlying vorticity manifold. These\ndevelopments are then extended to 2D quasi-geostrophic flows (via the potential\ndivorticity framework), magnetohydrodynamic flows and electron\nmagnetohydrodynamic flows (via the generalized magnetic flux framework) and the\nOkubo-Weiss criteria for these cases are considered.\n", "  Recent inapproximability results of Sly (2010), together with an\napproximation algorithm presented by Weitz (2006) establish a beautiful picture\nfor the computational complexity of approximating the partition function of the\nhard-core model. Let $\\lambda_c(T_\\Delta)$ denote the critical activity for the\nhard-model on the infinite $\\Delta$-regular tree. Weitz presented an FPTAS for\nthe partition function when $\\lambda<\\lambda_c(T_\\Delta)$ for graphs with\nconstant maximum degree $\\Delta$. In contrast, Sly showed that for all\n$\\Delta\\geq 3$, there exists $\\epsilon_\\Delta>0$ such that (unless RP=NP) there\nis no FPRAS for approximating the partition function on graphs of maximum\ndegree $\\Delta$ for activities $\\lambda$ satisfying\n$\\lambda_c(T_\\Delta)<\\lambda<\\lambda_c(T_\\Delta)+\\epsilon_\\Delta$.\n  We prove that a similar phenomenon holds for the antiferromagnetic Ising\nmodel. Recent results of Li et al. and Sinclair et al. extend Weitz's approach\nto any 2-spin model, which includes the antiferromagnetic Ising model, to yield\nan FPTAS for the partition function for all graphs of constant maximum degree\n$\\Delta$ when the parameters of the model lie in the uniqueness regime of the\ninfinite tree $T_\\Delta$. We prove the complementary result that for the\nantiferrogmanetic Ising model without external field that, unless RP=NP, for\nall $\\Delta\\geq 3$, there is no FPRAS for approximating the partition function\non graphs of maximum degree $\\Delta$ when the inverse temperature lies in the\nnon-uniqueness regime of the infinite tree $T_\\Delta$. Our results extend to a\nregion of the parameter space for general 2-spin models. Our proof works by\nrelating certain second moment calculations for random $\\Delta$-regular\nbipartite graphs to the tree recursions used to establish the critical points\non the infinite tree.\n", "  An important task for quantum information processing is optimal\ndiscrimination between two non-orthogonal quantum states, which until now has\nonly been realized optically. Here, we present and compare experimental\nrealizations of optimal quantum measurements for distinguishing between two\nnon-orthogonal quantum states encoded in a single ^14 N nuclear spin.\nImplemented measurement schemes are the minimum-error measurement (known as\nHelstrom measurement), unambiguous state discrimination using a standard\nprojective measurement, and optimal unambiguous state discrimination (known as\nIDP measurement), which utilizes a three-dimensional Hilbert space. Measurement\nefficiencies are found to be above 80% for all schemes and reach a value of 90%\nfor the IDP measurement\n", "  We study the Hamiltonian equations of motion of a heavy tracer particle\ninteracting with a dense weakly interacting Bose-Einstein condensate in the\nclassical (mean-field) limit. Solutions describing ballistic subsonic motion of\nthe particle through the condensate are constructed. We establish asymptotic\nstability of ballistic subsonic motion.\n", "  The main objective of this paper is to control the geometry of a future\noutgoing truncated null cone extending smoothly toward infinity in an\nEinstein-vacuum spacetime. In particular, we wish to do this under minimal\nregularity assumptions, namely, at the (weighted) L^2-curvature level. We show\nthat if the curvature flux and the data on an initial sphere of the cone are\nsufficiently close to the corresponding values in a standard Minkowski or\nSchwarzschild null cone, then we can obtain quantitative bounds on the geometry\nof the entire infinite cone. The same bounds also imply the existence of limits\nat infinity of the natural geometric quantities. Furthermore, we make no global\nassumptions on the spacetime, as all assumptions are applied only to this\nsingle truncated cone. In our sequel paper, we will apply these results in\norder to control the Bondi energy and the angular momentum associated with this\ncone.\n", "  We consider smooth null cones in a vacuum spacetime that extend to future\nnull infinity. For such cones that are perturbations of shear-free outgoing\nnull cones in Schwarzschild spacetimes, we prove bounds for the Bondi energy,\nmomentum, and rate of energy loss. The bounds depend on the closeness between\nthe given cone and a corresponding cone in a Schwarzschild spacetime, measured\npurely in terms of the differences between certain weighted $L^2$-norms of the\nspace-time curvature on the cones, and of the geometries of the spheres from\nwhich they emanate. A key step in this paper is the construction of a family of\nasymptotically round cuts of our cone, relative to which the Bondi energy is\nmeasured.\n", "  We prove various uniqueness results from null infinity, for linear waves on\nasymptotically flat space-times. Assuming vanishing of the solution to infinite\norder on suitable parts of future and past null infinities, we derive that the\nsolution must vanish in an open set in the interior. We find that the parts of\ninfinity where we must impose a vanishing condition depend strongly on the\nbackground geometry. In particular, for backgrounds with positive mass (such as\nSchwarzschild or Kerr), the required assumptions are much weaker than the ones\nin the Minkowski space-time. The results are nearly optimal in many respects.\nThey can be considered analogues of uniqueness from infinity results for second\norder elliptic operators. This work is partly motivated by questions in general\nrelativity.\n", "  We investigate the stability of stationary integral solutions of an ideal\nirrotational fluid in a general static and spherically symmetric background, by\nstudying the profile of the perturbation of the mass accretion rate. We\nconsider low angular momentum axisymmetric accretion flows for three different\naccretion disk models and consider time dependent and radial linear\nperturbation of the mass accretion rate. First we show that the propagation of\nsuch perturbation can be determined by an effective $2\\times2$ matrix, which\nhas qualitatively similar acoustic causal properties as one obtains via the\nperturbation of the velocity potential. Next, using this matrix we analytically\naddress the stability issues, for both standing and travelling wave\nconfigurations generated by the perturbation. Finally, based on this general\nformalism we briefly discuss the explicit example of the Schwarzschild\nspacetime and compare our results of stability with the existing literature,\nwhich instead address this problem via the perturbation of the velocity\npotential.\n", "  We examine properties of the inner and outer horizon thermodynamics of\nTaub-NUT (Newman-Unti-Tamburino) and Kerr-Taub-NUT (KTN) black hole (BH) in\nfour dimensional \\emph{Lorentzian geometry}. We compare and contrasted these\nproperties with the properties of Reissner Nordstr{\\o}m (RN) BH and Kerr BH. We\nfocus on \"area product\", \"entropy product\", \"irreducible mass product\" of the\nevent horizon and Cauchy horizons. Due to mass-dependence, we speculate that\nthese products have no beautiful quantization feature. Nor does it has any\nuniversal property. We further observe that the \\emph{First law} of BH\nthermodynamics and \\emph {Smarr-Gibbs-Duhem} relations do not hold for Taub-NUT\n(TN) and KTN BH in Lorentzian regime. The failure of these aforementioned\nfeatures are due to presence of the non-trivial NUT charge which makes the\nspace-time to be asymptotically non-flat, in contrast with RN BH and Kerr BH.\nThe another reason of the failure is that Lorentzian TN and Lorentzian KTN\ngeometry contains \\emph{Dirac-Misner type singularity}, which is a\nmanifestation of a non-trivial topological twist of the manifold. The black\nhole \\emph{mass formula} and \\emph{Christodoulou-Ruffini mass formula} for TN\nand KTN BHs are also computed. This thermodynamic product formulae gives us\nfurther understanding to the nature of BH entropy (inner and outer) at the\nmicroscopic level.\n", "  Using the fusion rules hypothesis for three-dimensional and two-dimensional\nNavier-Stokes turbulence, we generalize a previous non-perturbative locality\nproof to multiple applications of the nonlinear interactions operator on\ngeneralized structure functions of velocity differences. We shall call this\ngeneralization of non-perturbative locality to multiple applications of the\nnonlinear interactions operator \"multilocality\". The resulting cross-terms pose\na new challenge requiring a new argument and the introduction of a new fusion\nrule that takes advantage of rotational symmetry. Our main result is that the\nfusion rules hypothesis implies both locality and multilocality in both the IR\nand UV limits for the downscale energy cascade of three-dimensional\nNavier-Stokes turbulence and the downscale enstrophy cascade and inverse energy\ncascade of two-dimensional Navier-Stokes turbulence. We stress that these\nclaims relate to non-perturbative locality of generalized structure functions\non all orders, and not the term by term perturbative locality of diagrammatic\ntheories or closure models that involve only two-point correlation and response\nfunctions.\n", "  Reciprocity is shown so far only when the scattering potential is either real\nor parity symmetric complex. We extend this result for parity violating complex\npotential by considering several explicit examples: (i) we show reciprocity for\na PT symmetric (hence parity violating) complex potential which admits\npenetrating state solutions analytically for all possible values of incidence\nenergy and (ii) reciprocity is shown to hold at certain discrete energies for\ntwo other parity violating complex potentials.\n", "  Many proteins and peptides have an intrinsic capacity to sense and induce\nmembrane curvature, and play crucial roles for organizing and remodelling cell\nmembranes. However, the molecular driving forces behind these processes are not\nwell understood. Here, we describe a new approach to study curvature sensing,\nby simulating the direction-dependent interactions of single molecules with a\nbuckled lipid bilayer. We analyse three amphipathic antimicrobial peptides, a\nclass of membrane-associated molecules that specifically target and destabilize\nbacterial membranes, and find qualitatively different sensing characteristics\nthat would be difficult to resolve with other methods. These findings provide\nnew insights into the curvature sensing mechanisms of amphipathic peptides and\nchallenge existing theories of hydrophobic insertion. Our approach is generally\napplicable to a wide range of curvature sensing molecules, and our results\nprovide strong motivation to develop new experimental methods to track position\nand orientation of membrane proteins.\n", "  Recent Couette-cell shear experiments of carbopol gels have revealed the\nformation of a transient shear band before reaching the steady state, which is\ncharacterized by homogeneous flow. This shear band is observed in the small-gap\nlimit where the shear stress is spatially uniform. An effective-temperature\nmodel of the transient shear banding and solid-fluid transition is developed\nfor the small-gap limit. The small-gap model demonstrates the ability of a\ncontinuum-constitutive law that is based solely on microstructural\nrearrangements of the gel to account for this transient behavior, and\nidentifies that it proceeds via two distinct processes. A shear band nucleates\nand gradually broadens via disordering at the interface of the band.\nSimultaneously, spatially homogeneous fluidization is induced outside of the\nshear band where the disorder of the gel grows uniformly. Experimental data are\nused to determine the physical parameters of the theory, and direct,\nquantitative comparison is made to measurements of the structural evolution of\nthe gel, its fluidization time, and its mechanical response under plastic flow.\n", "  Spin foam models, an approach to defining the dynamics of loop quantum\ngravity, make use of the Plebanski formulation of gravity, in which gravity is\nrecovered from a topological field theory via certain constraints called\nsimplicity constraints. However, the simplicity constraints in their usual form\nselect more than just one gravitational sector as well as a degenerate sector.\nThis was shown, in previous work, to be the reason for the \"extra\" terms\nappearing in the semiclassical limit of the Euclidean EPRL amplitude. In this\nprevious work, a way to eliminate the extra sectors, and hence terms, was\ndeveloped, leading to the what was called the Euclidean proper vertex\namplitude. In the present work, these results are extended to the Lorentzian\nsignature, establishing what is called the Lorentzian proper vertex amplitude.\nThis extension is non-trivial and involves a number of new elements since, for\nLorentzian bivectors, the split into self-dual and anti-self-dual parts, on\nwhich the Euclidean derivation was based, is no longer available. In fact, the\nclassical parts of the present derivation provide not only an extension to the\nLorentzian case, but also, with minor modifications, provide a new, more four\ndimensionally covariant derivation for the Euclidean case. The new elements in\nthe quantum part of the derivation are due to the different structure of\nunitary representations of the Lorentz group.\n", "  We analyze the prospects for observing the CP-even neutral Higgs bosons (h\nand H) in their decays into flavor violating $b \\bar s+ c.c.$ channels at the\nproposed LHeC, with $\\sqrt s \\approx 1.3$ TeV, in the 2HDM Type-III, assuming a\nfour-zero texture in the Yukawa matrices and a general Higgs potential. We\nconsider theoretically consistent scenarios in agreement with current\nexperimental data from flavor and Higgs physics. We investigate the charged\ncurrent production process $\\nu_e \\phi q$ in presence of flavor violating\ndecays of the Higgs bosons, that lead to a 3-jets + $E\\!\\!\\!\\!/_T$ signature.\nWe demand exactly two jets, one tagged $b$-jet and one light-flavor jet, all in\nthe central rapidity region. The remaining jet (originated by the remanent\nquark $q$) is tagged in the forward or backward regions and this together with\na central jet veto (not more than one light-flavor jet) are essential\ncriterions to enhance the signal--to--background rates. We consider the most\nrelevant Standard Model (SM) backgrounds, treating $c$-jets separately from\nlight-flavor and gluon ones, while allowing for mis-tagging. We find that the\nSM-like Higgs boson, $h$, would be accessible within several parameter\nconfigurations of our model at approximately the 1-2$\\sigma$ level with 100\nfb$^{-1}$ of data. We also find that the heaviest neutral Higgs boson, $H$,\nwith mass up to 150 GeV, would have a 1$\\sigma$ significance for the same data\nsample. At the end of the LHeC running, one would have ten times data\naccumulation and for all the Higgs masses the significances are enhanced so as\nto allow for detection of both the $h$ and $H$ state. Hence, one of the most\nviable extensions of 2HDMs with FCNC's generated at tree level but controlled\nby a four-zero texture approach in the Yukawa matrices, as opposed to the\nadoption of ad hoc discrete symmetries, could be put under scrutiny at a future\nLHeC.\n", "  Intracellular calcium is regulated in part by the release of Ca$^{2+}$ ions\nfrom the endoplasmic reticulum via inositol-4,5-triphosphate receptor (IP$_3$R)\nchannels (among other possibilities such as RyR and L-type calcium channels).\nThe resulting dynamics are highly diverse, lead to local calcium \"puffs\" as\nwell as global waves propagating through cells, as observed in {\\it Xenopus}\noocytes, neurons, and other cell types. Local fluctuations in the number of\ncalcium ions play a crucial role in the onset of these features. Previous\nmodeling studies of calcium puff dynamics stemming from IP$_3$R channels have\npredominantly focused on stochastic channel models coupled to deterministic\ndiffusion of ions, thereby neglecting local fluctuations of the ion number.\nTracking of individual ions is computationally difficult due to the scale\nseparation in the Ca$^{2+}$ concentration when channels are in the open or\nclosed states. In this paper, a spatial multiscale model for investigating of\nthe dynamics of puffs is presented. It couples Brownian motion (diffusion) of\nions with a stochastic channel gating model. The model is used to analyze\ncalcium puff statistics. Concentration time traces as well as channel state\ninformation are studied. We identify the regime in which puffs can be found and\ndevelop a mean-field theory to extract the boundary of this regime. Puffs are\nonly possible when the time scale of channel inhibition is sufficiently large.\nImplications for the understanding of puff generation and termination are\ndiscussed.\n", "  Topological concepts have been introduced into electronic, photonic, and\nphononic systems, but have not been studied in surface-water-wave systems. Here\nwe study a one-dimensional periodic resonant surface-water-wave system and\ndemonstrate its topological transition. By selecting three different water\ndepths, we can construct different types of water waves - shallow, intermediate\nand deep water waves. The periodic surface-water-wave system consists of an\narray of cylindrical water tanks connected with narrow water channels. As the\nwidth of connecting channel varies, the band diagram undergoes a topological\ntransition which can be further characterized by Zak phase. This topological\ntransition holds true for shallow, intermediate and deep water waves. However,\nthe interface state at the boundary separating two topologically distinct\narrays of water tanks can exhibit different bands for shallow, intermediate and\ndeep water waves. Our work studies for the first time topological properties of\nwater wave systems, and paves the way to potential management of water waves.\n", "  Elucidating the nature of the magnetic ground state of iron-based\nsuperconductors is of paramount importance in unveiling the mechanism behind\ntheir high temperature superconductivity. Until recently, it was thought that\nsuperconductivity emerges only from an orthorhombic antiferromagnetic stripe\nphase, which can in principle be described in terms of either localized or\nitinerant spins. However, we recently reported that tetragonal symmetry is\nrestored inside the magnetically ordered state of a hole-doped BaFe2As2. This\nobservation was interpreted as indirect evidence of a new double-Q magnetic\nstructure, but alternative models of orbital order could not be ruled out.\nHere, we present Mossbauer data that show unambiguously that half of the iron\nsites in this tetragonal phase are non-magnetic, establishing conclusively the\nexistence of a novel magnetic ground state with a non-uniform magnetization\nthat is inconsistent with localized spins. We show that this state is naturally\nexplained as the interference between two spin-density waves, demonstrating the\nitinerant character of the magnetism of these materials and the primary role\nplayed by magnetic over orbital degrees of freedom.\n", "  In previous work, the Lorentzian proper vertex amplitude for a spin-foam\nmodel of quantum gravity was derived. In the present work, the asymptotics of\nthis amplitude are studied in the semi-classical limit. The starting point of\nthe analysis is an expression for the amplitude as an action integral with\naction differing from that in the EPRL case by an extra `projector' term which\nscales linearly with spins only in the asymptotic limit, and is discontinuous\non a submanifold of the integration domain. New tools are introduced to\ngeneralize stationary phase methods to this case. For the case of boundary data\nwhich can be glued to a non-degenerate Lorentzian 4-simplex, the asymptotic\nlimit of the amplitude is shown to equal the single Feynman term, showing that\nthe extra term in the asymptotics of the EPRL amplitude has been eliminated.\n", "  We present some results on the monotonicity of some traces involving\nfunctions of self-adjoint operators with respect to the natural ordering of\ntheir associated quadratic forms. We also apply these results to complete a\nproof of the Wegner estimate for continuum models of random Schr\\\"odinger\noperators as given in \\cite{co-hi1}.\n", "  We develop rigorous notions of causality and causal separability in the\nprocess framework introduced in [Oreshkov, Costa, Brukner, Nat. Commun. 3, 1092\n(2012)], which describes correlations between separate local experiments\nwithout a prior assumption of causal order between them. We consider the\ngeneral multipartite case and take into account the possibility for dynamical\ncausal order, where the order of a set of events can depend on other events in\nthe past. Starting from a general definition of causality, we derive an\niteratively formulated canonical decomposition of multipartite causal\nprocesses, and show that for a fixed number of settings and outcomes for each\nparty, the respective correlations form a polytope whose facets define causal\ninequalities. In the case of quantum processes, we investigate the link between\ncausality and the theory-dependent notion of causal separability, which we here\nextend to the multipartite case based on concrete principles. We show that\ncausality and causal separability are not equivalent in general by giving an\nexample of a physically admissible tripartite quantum process that is causal\nbut not causally separable. We also show that there exist causally separable\n(and hence causal) quantum processes that become non-causal if extended by\nsupplying the parties with entangled ancillas. This example of activation of\nnon-causality motivates the concepts of extensibly causal and extensibly\ncausally separable (ECS) processes, for which the respective property remains\ninvariant under extension with arbitrary ancillas. We characterize the class of\ntripartite ECS processes in terms of simple conditions on the form of the\nprocess matrix, which generalize the form of bipartite causally separable\nprocess matrices. We show that the processes realizable by classically\ncontrolled quantum circuits are ECS and conjecture that the reverse also holds.\n", "  We study the thermal conductivity of the one-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard model\nat finite temperature using a density matrix renormalization group approach.\nThe integrability of this model gives rise to ballistic thermal transport. We\ncalculate the temperature dependence of the thermal Drude weight at half\nfilling for various interactions and moreover, we compute its filling\ndependence at infinite temperature. The finite-frequency contributions\noriginating from the fact that the energy current is not a conserved quantity\nare investigated as well. We report evidence that breaking the integrability\nthrough a nearest-neighbor interaction leads to vanishing Drude weights and\ndiffusive energy transport. Moreover, we demonstrate that energy spreads\nballistically in local quenches with initially inhomogeneous energy density\nprofiles in the integrable case. We discuss the relevance of our results for\nthermalization in ultra-cold quantum gas experiments and for transport\nmeasurements with quasi-one dimensional materials.\n", "  Understanding the interaction mechanisms between large-scale\nmagnetohydrodynamic instabilities and small-scale drift-wave microturbulence is\nessential for predicting and optimizing the performance of magnetic confinement\nbased fusion energy experiments. We report progress on understanding these\ninteractions using both analytic theory and numerical simulations performed\nwith the BOUT++ [B. Dudson et al., Comput. Phys. Comm. 180, 1467 (2009)]\nframework. This work focuses upon the dynamics of the ion temperature gradient\ninstability in the presence of a background static magnetic island, using a\nweakly electromagnetic two-dimensional five-field fluid model. It is found that\nthe island width must exceed a threshold size (comparable to the turbulent\ncorrelation length in the no-island limit) to significantly impact the\nturbulence dynamics, with the primary impact being an increase in turbulent\nfluctuation and heat flux amplitudes. The turbulent radial ion energy flux is\nshown to localize near the X-point, but does so asymmetrically in the poloidal\ndimension. An effective turbulent resistivity which acts upon the island outer\nlayer is also calculated, and shown to always be significantly (10x - 100x)\ngreater than the collisional resistivity used in the simulations.\n", "  Cosmological parameters deduced from the Planck measurements of anisotropies\nin the cosmic microwave background are at some tension with direct astronomical\nmeasurements of various parameters at low redshifts. Very recently, it has been\nconjectured that this discrepancy can be reconciled if a certain fraction of\ndark matter is unstable and decays between recombination and the present epoch.\nHerein we show that if the superheavy relics have a branching into neutrinos B\n(X \\to \\nu \\bar \\nu) \\sim 3 \\times 10^{-9}, then this scenario can also\naccommodate the recently discovered extraterrestrial flux of neutrinos,\nrelaxing the tension between IceCube results and Fermi LAT data. The model is\nfully predictive and can be confronted with future IceCube data. We demonstrate\nthat in 10 years of observation IceCube will be able to distinguish the\nmono-energetic signal from X decay at the 3\\sigma level. In a few years of data\ntaking with the upgraded IceCube-Gen2 enough statistics will be gathered to\nelucidate the dark matter--neutrino connection at the 5\\sigma level.\n", "  Atomic Force Microscopy has enabled 2D imaging at the sub-molecular level,\nand 3D mapping of the potential field. However, fast identification of the\nsurface still remains a challenging topic. In this paper, as a step towards\nimplementation of such function, we introduce a control scheme and mathematical\ntreatment of the acquired data that enable retrieval of essential information\ncharacterizing the potential field, leading to fast acquisition of images with\nchemical contrast. The control scheme is based on tip sample distance\nmodulation at an angular frequency of ${\\omega}$, and null control of the\n${1\\omega}$ component of the self excitation frequency of the oscillator. It is\ndemonstrated that the control is robust in UHV for a frequency well as small as\na few Hz/MHz, and that the mathematical treatment results in satisfactory\nidentification of the potential field. Morse potential is chosen as a case\nstudy for identifying the Morse parameters per pixel. Atomic features with\nsimilar topography were distinguished by differences in the parameters. The\ndecay length parameter was resolved with a resolution of 10 pm. The method was\ndemonstrated on quenched Silicon at a scan rate comparable to normal imaging.\n", "  The Polyakov relation, which in the sphere topology gives the changes of the\nLiouville action under the variation of the position of the sources, in the\ncase of higher genus is related also to the dependence of the action on the\nmoduli of the surface. We write and prove such a relation for genus 1 and for\nall hyperelliptic surfaces.\n", "  The inclusion of strong coupling to states of projectile and target nuclei\nfor 115.9 MeV \\nuc{16}{O} scattering from \\nuc{12}{C} leads to an S-matrix\nwhich, when subject to $S_{L} \\rightarrow V(r) $ inversion, yields highly\nundulatory local potentials. Previous work has shown that explicitly\n$L$-dependent non-undulatory potentials are equivalent to undulatory\n$L$-independent potentials with the same S-matrix. Here we show that\n$L$-independent equivalents for certain simple model $L$-dependent potentials\nexhibit undulatory features qualitatively similar to those arising from channel\ncoupling for 115.9 MeV \\nuc{16}{O} scattering from \\nuc{12}{C}. We discuss the\nrelevance to the question of $L$-dependence as a generic property of\nnucleus-nucleus interactions.\n", "  In this letter we present our results for the four-loop beta-function of the\nstrong coupling in the Standard Model of fundamental interactions. We take\ntop-Yukawa and self-Higgs interactions into account, but neglect electroweak\ngauge couplings.\n", "  We consider the unique continuation properties of asymptotically Anti-de\nSitter spacetimes by studying Klein-Gordon-type equations $\\Box_g \\phi + \\sigma\n\\phi = \\mathcal{G} ( \\phi, \\partial \\phi )$, $\\sigma \\in \\mathbb{R}$, on a\nlarge class of such spacetimes. Our main result establishes that if $\\phi$\nvanishes to sufficiently high order (depending on $\\sigma$) on a sufficiently\nlong time interval along the conformal boundary $\\mathcal{I}$, then the\nsolution necessarily vanishes in a neighborhood of $\\mathcal{I}$. In\nparticular, in the $\\sigma$-range where Dirichlet and Neumann conditions are\npossible on $\\mathcal{I}$ for the forward problem, we prove uniqueness if both\nthese conditions are imposed. The length of the time interval can be related to\nthe refocusing time of null geodesics on these backgrounds and is expected to\nbe sharp. Some global applications as well a uniqueness result for\ngravitational perturbations are also discussed. The proof is based on novel\nCarleman estimates established in this setting.\n", "  We show that the traces of $U_q(\\widehat{\\mathfrak{sl}}_2)$-intertwiners of\nEtingof-Schiffmann-Varchenko valued in the three-dimensional evaluation\nrepresentation converge in a certain region of parameters and give a\nrepresentation-theoretic construction of Felder-Varchenko's hypergeometric\nsolutions to the $q$-KZB heat equation. This gives the first proof that such a\ntrace function converges and resolves the first case of the Etingof-Varchenko\nconjecture.\n  As applications, we prove a symmetry property for traces of intertwiners and\nprove Felder-Varchenko's conjecture that their elliptic Macdonald polynomials\nare related to the affine Macdonald polynomials defined as traces over\nirreducible integrable $U_q(\\widehat{\\mathfrak{sl}}_2)$-modules by\nEtingof-Kirillov Jr. In the trigonometric and classical limits, we recover\nresults of Etingof-Kirillov Jr. and Etingof-Varchenko. Our method relies on an\ninterplay between the method of coherent states applied to the free field\nrealization of the $q$-Wakimoto module of Matsuo, convergence properties given\nby the theta hypergeometric integrals of Felder-Varchenko, and rationality\nproperties originating from the representation-theoretic definition of the\ntrace function.\n", "  The relativistic Doppler shifting of visible electromagnetic radiation to\nbeyond the human ocular range reduces the incident radiance of the source.\nConsequently, luminous astrophysical bodies (LABs) can be rendered invisible\nwith sufficient relativistic motion. This paper determines the proper distance\nas a function of relativistic velocity at which a luminous object attains\nocular invisibility.\n", "  The behaviour of an Efimov excited state is studied within a three-body\nFaddeev formalism for a general neutron-neutron-core system, where neutron-core\nis bound and neutron-neutron is unbound, by considering zero-ranged as well as\nfinite-ranged two-body interactions. For the finite-ranged interactions we have\nconsidered a one-term separable Yamaguchi potential. The main objective is to\nstudy range corrections in a scaling approach, with focus in the exotic carbon\nhalo nucleus $^{20}C$.\n", "  Using the transfer matrix formalism, we study the transmission properties of\na Bragg grating constructed from a layered axionic material. Such a material\ncan be realized by a topological insulator subject to a time-symmetry breaking\nperturbation, such as an external magnetic field or surface magnetic\nimpurities. Whilst the reflective properties of the structure are only\nnegligibly changed by the presence of the axionic material, the grating induces\na Faraday rotation and ellipticity in the transmitted light. We find that for\nTM polarized light incident on a 16 layer structure at 76 degrees to the normal\nthe Faraday rotation can approach ~232 mrad (~13 degrees), whilst interference\nfrom the multi-layered structure ensures high transmission. This is\nsignificantly higher than Faraday rotations for the TM polarization at normal\nincidences or the TE polarization at any incident angle. Thus, Bragg gratings\nin this geometry show a strong optical signal of the magneto-electric and,\nhence, provide an ideal system in which to observe this effect by optical\nmeans.\n", "  We study the four-dimensional effective theory arising from ten-dimensional\nheterotic supergravity compactified on manifolds with torsion. In particular,\ngiven the heterotic superpotential appropriately corrected at\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\alpha')$ to account for the Green-Schwarz anomaly cancellation\nmechanism, we investigate properties of four-dimensional Minkowski vacua of\nthis theory. Considering the restrictions arising from F-terms and D-terms we\nidentify the infinitesimal massless moduli space of the theory. We show that it\nagrees with the results that have recently been obtained from a ten-dimensional\nperspective where supersymmetric Minkowski solutions including the Bianchi\nidentity correspond to an integrable holomorphic structure, with infinitesimal\nmoduli calculated by its first cohomology. As has recently been noted,\ninterplay of complex structure and bundle deformations through holomorphic and\nanomaly constraints can lead to fewer moduli than may have been expected. We\nderive a relation between the number of complex structure and bundle moduli\nremoved from the low energy theory in this way, and give conditions for there\nto be no complex structure moduli or bundle moduli remaining in the low energy\ntheory. The link between Yukawa couplings and obstruction theory is also\nbriefly discussed.\n", "  The dispersion of a diffusive scalar in a fluid flowing through a network has\nmany applications including to biological flows, porous media, water supply and\nurban pollution. Motivated by this, we develop a large-deviation theory that\npredicts the evolution of the concentration of a scalar released in a\nrectangular network in the limit of large time $t \\gg 1$. This theory provides\nan approximation for the concentration that remains valid for large distances\nfrom the centre of mass, specifically for distances up to $O(t)$ and thus much\nbeyond the $O(t^{1/2})$ range where a standard Gaussian approximation holds. A\nbyproduct of the approach is a closed-form expression for the effective\ndiffusivity tensor that governs this Gaussian approximation. Monte Carlo\nsimulations of Brownian particles confirm the large-deviation results and\ndemonstrate their effectiveness in describing the scalar distribution when $t$\nis only moderately large.\n", "  We present a general phase-space kinetic model for charged particle transport\nthrough combined localised and delocalised states, capable of describing\nscattering collisions, trapping, detrapping and losses. The model is described\nby a generalised Boltzmann equation, for which an analytical solution is found\nin Fourier-Laplace space. The velocity of the centre of mass (CM) and the\ndiffusivity about it are determined analytically, together with the flux\ntransport coefficients. Transient negative values of the free particle CM\ntransport coefficients can be observed due to the trapping to, and detrapping\nfrom, localised states. A Chapman-Enskog type perturbative solution technique\nis applied, confirming the analytical results and highlighting the emergence of\na density gradient representation in the weak-gradient hydrodynamic regime. A\ngeneralised diffusion equation with a unique global time operator is shown to\narise, reducing to the standard diffusion equation and a Caputo fractional\ndiffusion equation in the normal and dispersive limits. A subordination\ntransformation is used to solve the generalised diffusion equation by mapping\nfrom the solution of a corresponding standard diffusion equation.\n", "  In this paper, we discuss the parametric symmetries in different exactly\nsolvable systems characterized by real or complex P T symmetric potentials. We\nfocus our at- tention on the conventional potentials such as the generalized\nPoschl Teller (GPT), o Scarf-I and P T symmetric Scarf-II which are invariant\nunder certain parametric transformations. The resulting set of potentials are\nshown to yield a completely dif- ferent behavior of the bound state solutions.\nFurther the supersymmetric (SUSY) partner potentials acquire different forms\nunder such parametric transformations leading to new sets of exactly solvable\nreal and P T symmetric complex potentials. These potentials are also observed\nto be shape invariant (SI) in nature. We subse- quently take up a study of the\nnewly discovered rationally extended SI Potentials, corresponding to the above\nmentioned conventional potentials, whose bound state solutions are associated\nwith the exceptional orthogonal polynomials (EOPs). We discuss the\ntransformations of the corresponding Casimir operator employing the properties\nof the so(2,1) algebra.\n", "  The construction of physically relevant low dimensional state models, and the\ndesign of appropriate measurements are key issues in tackling quantum state\ntomography for large dimensional systems. We consider the statistical problem\nof estimating low rank states in the set-up of multiple ions tomography, and\ninvestigate how the estimation error behaves with a reduction in the number of\nmeasurement settings, compared with the standard ion tomography setup. We\npresent extensive simulation results showing that the error is robust with\nrespect to the choice of states of a given rank, the random selection of\nsettings, and that the number of settings can be significantly reduced with\nonly a negligible increase in error. We present an argument to explain these\nfindings based on a concentration inequality for the Fisher information matrix.\nIn the more general setup of random basis measurements we use this argument to\nshow that for certain rank $r$ states it suffices to measure in $O(r\\log d)$\nbases to achieve the average Fisher information over all bases. We present\nnumerical evidence for states upto 8 atoms, supporting a conjecture on a lower\nbound for the Fisher information which, if true, would imply a similar\nbehaviour in the case of Pauli bases. The relation to similar problems in\ncompressed sensing is also discussed.\n", "  In standard cosmology, the growth of structure becomes significant following\nmatter-radiation equality. In non-thermal histories, where an effectively\nmatter-dominated phase occurs due to scalar oscillations prior to Big Bang\nNucleosynthesis, a new scale at smaller wavelengths appears in the matter power\nspectrum. Density perturbations that enter the horizon during the\nmatter-dominated phase grow linearly with the scale factor prior to the onset\nof radiation domination, which leads to enhanced inhomogeneity on small scales\nif dark matter thermally and kinetically decouples during the matter-dominated\nphase. The microhalos that form from these enhanced perturbations significantly\nboost the self-annihilation rate for dark matter. This has important\nimplications for indirect detection experiments: the larger annihilation rate\nwill result in observable signals from dark matter candidates that are usually\ndeemed untestable. As a proof of principle, we consider Binos in heavy\nsupersymmetry with an intermediate extended Higgs sector and all other\nsuperpartners decoupled. We find that these isolated Binos, which lie under the\nneutrino floor, can account for the dark matter relic density while also\nleading to observable predictions for Fermi-LAT. Current limits on the\nannihilation cross section from Fermi-LAT's observations of dwarf spheroidal\ngalaxies may already constrain Bino dark matter up to masses $\\mathcal{O}(300)$\nGeV, depending on the internal structure of the microhalos. More extensive\nconstraints are possible with improved gamma-ray bounds and boost calculations\nfrom $N$-body simulations.\n", "  At present, all physical models of diffuse Galactic gamma-ray emission assume\nthat the distribution of cosmic-ray sources traces the observed populations of\neither OB stars, pulsars, or supernova remnants. However, since H2-rich regions\nhost significant star formation and numerous supernova remnants, the morphology\nof observed H2 gas should also provide a physically motivated, high-resolution\ntracer for cosmic-ray injection. We assess the impact of utilizing H2 as a\ntracer for cosmic-ray injection on models of diffuse Galactic gamma-ray\nemission. We employ state-of-the-art 3D particle diffusion and gas density\nmodels, along with a physical model for the star-formation rate based on global\nSchmidt laws. Allowing a fraction, f_H2, of cosmic-ray sources to trace the\nobserved H2 density, we find that a theoretically well-motivated value f_H2 ~\n0.20 -- 0.25 (i) provides a significantly better global fit to the diffuse\nGalactic gamma-ray sky and (ii) highly suppresses the intensity of the residual\ngamma-ray emission from the Galactic center region. Specifically, in models\nutilizing our best global fit values of f_H2 ~ 0.20 -- 0.25, the spectrum of\nthe galactic center gamma-ray excess is drastically affected, and the\nmorphology of the excess becomes inconsistent with predictions for dark matter\nannihilation.\n", "  We propose and analyze a new approach based on parity-time ($\\mathcal{PT}$)\nsymmetric microcavities with balanced gain and loss to enhance the performance\nof cavity-assisted metrology. We identify the conditions under which\n$\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric microcavities allow to improve sensitivity beyond what\nis achievable in loss-only systems. We discuss its application to the detection\nof mechanical motion, and show that the sensitivity is significantly enhanced\nin the vicinity of the transition point from unbroken- to broken-$\\mathcal{PT}$\nregimes. We believe that our results open a new direction for\n$\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric physical systems and it may find use in ultra-high\nprecision metrology and sensing.\n", "  We propose a non-linear, hybrid quantum-classical scheme for simulating\nnon-equilibrium dynamics of strongly correlated fermions described by the\nHubbard model in a Bethe lattice in the thermodynamic limit. Our scheme\nimplements non-equilibrium dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) and uses a\ndigital quantum simulator to solve a quantum impurity problem whose parameters\nare iterated to self-consistency via a classically computed feedback loop where\nquantum gate errors can be partly accounted for. We analyse the performance of\nthe scheme in an example case.\n", "  We present detailed analytic calculations of finite-volume energy spectra,\nmean field theory, as well as a systematic low-energy effective field theory\nfor the square lattice quantum dimer model. The analytic considerations explain\nwhy a string connecting two external static charges in the confining columnar\nphase fractionalizes into eight distinct strands with electric flux\n$\\frac{1}{4}$. An emergent approximate spontaneously broken $SO(2)$ symmetry\ngives rise to a pseudo-Goldstone boson. Remarkably, this soft phonon-like\nexcitation, which is massless at the Rokhsar-Kivelson (RK) point, exists far\nbeyond this point. The Goldstone physics is captured by a systematic low-energy\neffective field theory. We determine its low-energy parameters by matching the\nanalytic effective field theory with exact diagonalization results and Monte\nCarlo data. This confirms that the model exists in the columnar (and not in a\nplaquette or mixed) phase all the way to the RK point.\n", "  In recent years, the increasing precision of direct cosmic rays measurements\nopened the door to indirect searches of dark matter with high-sensitivity and\nto more accurate predictions for radiation doses received by astronauts and\nelectronics in space. The key ingredients in the study of these phenomena are\nthe knowledge of the local interstellar spectrum (LIS) of galactic cosmic rays\n(GCRs) and the understanding of how the solar modulation affects the LIS inside\nthe heliosphere. Voyager 1, AMS-02 and PAMELA measurements of proton fluxes\nprovide invaluable information, allowing us to shed light on the shape of the\nLIS and the details of the solar modulation during solar cycles 23 and 24. A\nnew parametrization of the proton LIS is presented, based on the latest data\nfrom Voyager 1 and AMS-02. Using the framework of the force-field\napproximation, the solar modulation parameter is extracted from the\ntime-dependent proton fluxes measured by PAMELA. A modified version of the\nforce-field approximation with an energy-dependent modulation parameter is\nintroduced, yielding better results on proton data than the force-field\napproximation. The results are compared with the modulation parameter inferred\nby neutron monitors.\n", "  Optical dipole-traps are used in various scientific fields, including\nclassical optics, quantum optics and biophysics. Here, we propose and implement\na dipole-trap for nanoparticles that is based on focusing from the full solid\nangle with a deep parabolic mirror. The key aspect is the generation of a\nlinear-dipole mode which is predicted to provide a tight trapping potential. We\ndemonstrate the trapping of rod-shaped nanoparticles and validate the trapping\nfrequencies to be on the order of the expected ones. The described realization\nof an optical trap is applicable for various other kinds of solid-state\ntargets. The obtained results demonstrate the feasibility of optical\ndipole-traps which simultaneously provide high trap stiffness and allow for\nefficient interaction of light and matter in free space.\n", "  Lattice QCD calculations with chiral fermions of the $\\pi$N sigma term\n$\\sigma_{\\pi N}$ and strangeness sigma term $\\sigma_{sN}$ including chiral\ninterpolation with continuum and volume corrections are provided in this work,\nwith the excited-state contaminations subtracted properly. We calculate the\nscalar matrix element for the light/strange quark directly and find\n$\\sigma_{\\pi N}=45.9(7.4)(2.8)$ MeV, with the disconnected insertion part\ncontributing 20(12)(4)\\%, and $\\sigma_{sN}=40.2(11.7)(3.5)$ MeV, which is\nsomewhat smaller than $\\sigma_{\\pi N}$. The ratio of the strange/light scalar\nmatrix elements is $y$ = 0.09(3)(1).\n", "  We explore the energy dependence of $\\pi$ mesons off the background abelian\nmagnetic field on the base of quenched SU(3) lattice gauge theory and calculate\nthe magnetic dipole polarizability of charged and neutral pions for various\nlattice volumes and lattice spacings. The contribution of the magnetic\nhyperpolarizability to the neutral pion energy has been also found.\n", "  We review various aspects of jet physics in the context of hadron colliders.\nWe start by discussing the definitions and properties of jets and recent\ndevelopment in this area. We then consider the question of factorization for\nprocesses with jets, in particular for cases in which jets are produced in\nspecial configurations, like for example in the region of forward rapidities.\nWe review numerous perturbative methods for calculating predictions for jet\nprocesses, including the fixed-order calculations as well as various matching\nand merging techniques. We also discuss the questions related to\nnon-perturbative effects and the role they play in precision jet studies. We\ndescribe the status of calculations for processes with jet vetoes and we also\nelaborate on production of jets in forward direction. Throughout the article,\nwe present selected comparisons between state-of-the-art theoretical\npredictions and the data from the LHC.\n", "  In this work we show that two absorbing microbeads can briefly share the same\noptical trap. Optical forces pull the particles towards the waist of the\ntrapping beam. However, once a particle reaches the vicinity of the waist, the\nsurrounding liquid is superheated creating an explosion or cavitation bubble\nthat pushes the particle away while lengthening or shortening the trajectories\nof the surrounding particles. In this way each particle briefly interacts with\nthe beam waist at different times. We find that when two microbeads reach the\nwaist simultaneously, a larger explosion might result in ejection from the\ntrap. We measure the characteristic timescale of two particle coalescence near\nthe waist and find a Poisson decaying exponential probability distribution. The\nresults are consistent with a simple simulation and show why the characteristic\ntimescales for transient trapping of multiple absorbing particles decrease as\nmore objects are added.\n", "  Several information measures have recently been defined which capture the\nnotion of \"recoverability.\" In particular, the fidelity of recovery quantifies\nhow well one can recover a system $A$ of a tripartite quantum state, defined on\nsystems $ABC$, by acting on system $C$ alone. The relative entropy of recovery\nis an associated measure in which the fidelity is replaced by relative entropy.\nIn this paper, we provide concrete operational interpretations of the\naforementioned recovery measures in terms of a computational decision problem\nand a hypothesis testing scenario. Specifically, we show that the fidelity of\nrecovery is equal to the maximum probability with which a computationally\nunbounded quantum prover can convince a computationally bounded quantum\nverifier that a given quantum state is recoverable. The quantum interactive\nproof system giving this operational meaning requires four messages exchanged\nbetween the prover and verifier, but by forcing the prover to perform his\nactions in superposition, we construct a different proof system that requires\nonly two messages. The result is that the associated decision problem is in\nQIP(2) and another argument establishes it as hard for QSZK (both classes\ncontain problems believed to be difficult to solve for a quantum computer). We\nfinally prove that the regularized relative entropy of recovery is equal to the\noptimal Type II error exponent when trying to distinguish many copies of a\ntripartite state from a recovered version of this state, such that the Type I\nerror is constrained to be no larger than a constant.\n", "  We explore topological transitions in parameter space in order to enable\nadiabatic passages between regions adiabatically disconnected within a given\nparameter manifold. To this end, we study the Hamiltonian of two coupled qubits\ninteracting with external magnetic fields, and make use of the analogy between\nthe Berry curvature and magnetic fields in parameter space, with spectrum\ndegeneracies associated to magnetic charges. Symmetry-breaking terms induce\nsharp topological transitions on these charge distributions, and we show how\none can exploit this effect to bypass crossing degeneracies. We also\ninvestigate the curl of the Berry curvature, an interesting but as of yet not\nfully explored object, which together with its divergence uniquely defines this\nfield. Finally, we suggest a simple method for measuring the Berry curvature,\nthereby showing how one can experimentally verify our results.\n", "  In this paper, we introduce a freeze-out scheme for the dynamical models near\nthe QCD critical point through coupling the decoupled classical particles with\nthe order parameter field. With a modified distribution function that satisfies\nspecific static fluctuations, we calculate the correlated fluctuations of net\nprotons on the hydrodynamic freeze-out surface. A comparison with recent STAR\ndata shows that our model calculations could roughly reproduce energy dependent\ncumulant $C_4$ and $\\kappa \\sigma^2$ of net protons through tuning the related\nparameters. However, the calculated $C_2$ and $C_3$ with both Poisson and\nBinomial baselines are always above the experimental data due to the positive\ncontributions from the static critical fluctuations. In order to qualitatively\nand quantitatively describe the experimental data, the dynamical critical\nfluctuations and more realistic non-critical fluctuation baselines should be\ninvestigated in the near future.\n", "  Fermi surface topology and pairing symmetry are two pivotal characteristics\nof a superconductor. Superconductivity in one monolayer (1ML) FeSe thin film\nhas attracted great interest recently due to its intriguing interfacial\nproperties and possibly high superconducting transition temperature (Tc) over\n77 K. Here, we report high-resolution measurements of the Fermi surface and\nsuperconducting gaps in 1ML FeSe using angle-resolved photoemission\nspectroscopy (ARPES). Two ellipse-like electron pockets are clearly resolved\noverlapping with each other at the Brillouin zone corner. The superconducting\ngap is nodeless but moderately anisotropic, which put strong constraints on\ndetermining the pairing symmetry. The gap maxima locate along the major axis of\nellipse, which cannot be explained by a single d-wave, extended s-wave, or\ns$\\pm$ gap function. Four gap minima are observed at the intersection of\nelectron pockets suggesting the existence of either a sign change or\norbital-dependent pairing in 1ML FeSe.\n", "  Spontaneous symmetry breaking occurs in a physical system whenever the ground\nstate does not share the symmetry of the underlying theory, e.g., the\nHamiltonian. It gives rise to massless Nambu-Goldstone modes and massive\nAnderson-Higgs modes. These modes provide a fundamental understanding of matter\nin the Universe and appear as collective phase/amplitude excitations of an\norder parameter in a many-body system. The amplitude excitation plays a crucial\nrole in determining the critical exponents governing universal non-equilibrium\ndynamics in the Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM). Here, we characterize the\namplitude excitations in a spin-1 condensate and measure their energy gap for\ndifferent phases of the quantum phase transition. At the quantum critical point\nof the transition, finite size effects lead to a non-zero gap. Our measurements\nare consistent with this prediction, and furthermore, we demonstrate an\nadiabatic quench through the phase transition, which is forbidden at the mean\nfield level. This work paves the way toward generating entanglement through an\nadiabatic phase transition.\n", "  In this article, we propose different background models of extended theories\nof gravity, which are minimally coupled to the SM fields, to explain the\npossibility of genesis of dark matter without affecting the SM particle sector.\nWe modify the gravity sector by allowing quantum corrections motivated from (1)\nlocal $f(R)$ gravity and (2) non-minimally coupled gravity with SM sector and\ndilaton field. Next we apply conformal transformation on the metric to\ntransform the action back to the Einstein frame. We also show that an effective\ntheory constructed from these extended theories of gravity and SM sector looks\nexactly the same. Using the relic constraint observed by Planck 2015, we\nconstrain the scale of the effective field theory ($\\Lambda_{UV}$) as well as\nthe dark matter mass ($M$). We consider two cases- (1) light dark matter (LDM)\nand (2) heavy dark matter (HDM), and deduce upper bounds on thermally averaged\ncross section of dark matter annihilating to SM particles. Further we show that\nour model naturally incorporates self interactions of dark matter. Using these\nself interactions, we derive the constraints on the parameters of the (1) local\n$f(R)$ gravity and (2) non-minimally coupled gravity from dark matter self\ninteraction. Finally, we propose some different UV complete models from a\nparticle physics point of view, which can give rise to the same effective\ntheory that we have deduced from extended theories of gravity.\n", "  We propose a new scenario for baryogenesis through leptogenesis, where the CP\nphase relevant for leptogenesis is connected directly to the PMNS phase(s) in\nthe light neutrino mixing matrix. The scenario is realized in case only one CP\nphase appears in the full theory, originating from the complex vacuum\nexpextation value of a standard model singlet field. In order to realize this\nscheme, the electroweak symmetry is required to be broken during the\nleptogenesis era and a new loop diagram with an intermediate $W$ boson exchange\nincluding the low energy neutrino mixing matrix should play the dominant\ncontribution to the CP violation for leptogenesis. In this letter, we discuss\nthe new basic mechanism, which we call type-II leptogenesis, and give an\nestimate for maximally reachable baryon asymmetry depending on the PMNS phases.\n", "  We study the hadronization time of heavy quark in nuclear matter by using the\ncoalescence model and the spatial diffusion constant of heavy quark from\nlattice Quantum Chromodynamic calculations, assuming that the main interaction\nof heavy quark at the critical temperature is hadronization. It is found that\nthe hadronization time of heavy quark is about 3 fm/c for $2\\pi T_c D_s=6$, if\na heavy quark is combined with the nearest light antiquark in coordinate space\nwithout any correlation between momentum of heavy quark and that of light\nantiquark which form a heavy meson. However, the hadronization time reduces to\n0.6-1.2 fm/c for charm and 0.4-0.9 fm/c for bottom, depending on heavy meson\nradius, in the presence of momentum correlation. Considering the interspace\nbetween quarks and antiquarks at the critical temperature, it seems that the\nhadronization of heavy quark does not happen instantaneously but gradually for\na considerable time, if started from the thermal distribution of quarks and\nantiquarks.\n", "  We study a system consisting of a superconducting flux qubit strongly coupled\nto a microwave cavity. The fundamental cavity mode is externally driven and the\nresponse is investigated in the weak nonlinear regime. We find that near the\ncrossing point, at which the resonance frequencies of the cavity mode and qubit\ncoincide, the sign of the Kerr coefficient changes, and consequently the type\nof nonlinear response changes from softening to hardening. Furthermore, the\ncavity response exhibits superharmonic resonances when the ratio between the\nqubit frequency and the cavity fundamental mode frequency is tuned close to an\ninteger value. The nonlinear response is characterized by the method of\nintermodulation and both signal and idler gains are measured. The experimental\nresults are compared with theoretical predictions and good qualitative\nagreement is obtained. The superharmonic resonances have potential for\napplications in quantum amplification and generation of entangled states of\nlight.\n", "  Among their amazing properties, graphene and related low-dimensional\nmaterials show quantized charge-density fluctuations--known as plasmons--when\nexposed to photons or electrons of suitable energies. Graphene nanoribbons\noffer an enhanced tunability of these resonant modes, due to their\ngeometrically controllable band gaps. The formidable effort made over recent\nyears in developing graphene-based technologies is however weakened by a lack\nof predictive modeling approaches that draw upon available {\\it ab initio}\nmethods. An example of such a framework is presented here, focusing on\nnarrow-width graphene nanoribbons organized in periodic planar arrays.\nTime-dependent density-functional calculations reveal unprecedented plasmon\nmodes of different nature at visible to infrared energies. Specifically,\nsemimetallic~(zigzag) nanoribbons display an intraband plasmon following the\nenergy-momentum dispersion of a two-dimensional electron gas.\nSemiconducting~(armchair) nanoribbons are instead characterized by two distinct\nintraband and interband plasmons, whose fascinating interplay is extremely\nresponsive to either injection of charge carriers or increase in electronic\ntemperature. These oscillations share some common trends with recent\nnanoinfrared imaging of confined edge and surface plasmon modes detected in\ngraphene nanoribbons of $100$-$500$~nm width.\n", "  We consider N=2 supergravity in four dimensions, coupled to an arbitrary\nnumber of vector- and hypermultiplets, where abelian isometries of the\nquaternionic hyperscalar target manifold are gauged. Using a static and\nspherically or hyperbolically symmetric ansatz for the fields, a\none-dimensional effective action is derived whose variation yields all the\nequations of motion. By imposing a sort of Dirac charge quantization condition,\none can express the complete scalar potential in terms of a superpotential and\nwrite the action as a sum of squares. This leads to first-order flow equations,\nthat imply the second-order equations of motion. The first-order flow turns out\nto be driven by Hamilton's characteristic function in the Hamilton-Jacobi\nformalism, and contains among other contributions the superpotential of the\nscalars. We then include also magnetic gaugings and generalize the flow\nequations to a symplectically covariant form. Moreover, by rotating the charges\nin an appropriate way, an alternative set of non-BPS first-order equations is\nobtained that corresponds to a different squaring of the action. Finally, we\nuse our results to derive the attractor equations for near-horizon geometries\nof extremal black holes.\n", "  We analyze reactive collisions of a single Ba$^+$ ion in contact with an\nultracold gas of Rb atoms at low three-body collision energies of 2.2(9)\nmK$\\times k_{\\mathrm{B}}$. Mapping out the Ba$^+$ loss rate dependence on the\nRb atom density we can discern two-body reactive collisions from three-body\nones and for the first time determine both rate coefficients which are\n$k_2=3.1(6)(6)\\times 10^{-13}\\textrm{cm}^{3}\\textrm{s}^{-1}$ and\n$k_3=1.04(4)(45)\\times 10^{-24}\\textrm{cm}^{6}\\textrm{s}^{-1}$, respectively\n(statistical and systematic errors in parenthesis). Thus, the measured ternary\nrecombination dominates over binary reactions even at moderate atom densities\nof $n\\approx 10^{12}\\: \\textrm{cm}^{-3}$. The results for Ba$^+$ and Rb are\nrepresentative for a wide range of cold ion-atom systems and can serve as a\nguidance for the future development of the field of hybrid atom-ion research.\n", "  The development of sophisticated experimental means to control nanoscale\nsystems has motivated efforts to design driving protocols which minimize the\nenergy dissipated to the environment. Computational models are a crucial tool\nin this practical challenge. We describe a general method for sampling an\nensemble of finite-time, nonequilibrium protocols biased towards a low average\ndissipation. We show that this scheme can be carried out very efficiently in\nseveral limiting cases. As an application, we sample the ensemble of\nlow-dissipation protocols that invert the magnetization of a 2D Ising model and\nexplore how the diversity of the protocols varies in response to constraints on\nthe average dissipation. In this example, we find that there is a large set of\nprotocols with average dissipation close to the optimal value, which we argue\nis a general phenomenon.\n", "  In this work we study the case of deconfinement in compact star interiors in\nthe presence of a strong first order phase transition associated to a critical\nend point in the QCD phase diagram. Neutron stars fulfilling these conditions\nshow a third branch in the mass-radius diagram with the first and second\nbranches being the white dwarfs and neutron stars configurations. The\ntransition to the third branch can be reached by a pure hadronic neutron star\nthrough an induced collapse releasing energy that corresponds to a mass-energy\ndifference between the second and third branch configurations. Physical\noutcomes of this phenomenon that can potentially explain the already detected\nastrophysical signals are discussed. In particular we present energy\nestimations for the case of a fast radio burst, seen as a double-peak structure\nin the object's light curve.\n", "  In the context of f(R) gravity theories, we show that the apparent mass of a\nneutron star as seen from an observer at infinity is numerically calculable but\nrequires careful matching, first at the star's edge, between interior and\nexterior solutions, none of them being totally Schwarzschild-like but\npresenting instead small oscillations of the curvature scalar R; and second at\nlarge radii, where the Newtonian potential is used to identify the mass of the\nneutron star. We find that for the same equation of state, this mass definition\nis always larger than its general relativistic counterpart. We exemplify this\nwith quadratic $R^2$ and Hu-Sawicki-like modifications of the standard General\nRelativity action. Therefore, the finding of two-solar mass neutron stars\nbasically imposes no constraint on stable f(R) theories. However, star radii\nare in general smaller than in General Relativity, which can give an\nobservational handle on such classes of models at the astrophysical level. Both\nlarger masses and smaller matter radii are due to much of the apparent\neffective energy residing in the outer metric for scalar-tensor theories.\nFinally, because the f(R) neutron star masses can be much larger than General\nRelativity counterparts, the total energy available for radiating gravitational\nwaves could be of order several solar masses, and thus a merger of these stars\nconstitutes an interesting wave source.\n", "  We present a numerical study of the spatial correlations of a\nquasi-two-dimensional granular fluid kept in a non-static steady state via\nvertical shaking. The simulations explore a wide range of packing fractions,\nvertical accelerations and restitution coefficients, always staying below the\ncrystallization limit. From the simulations we obtain the relevant Pair\nDistribution Functions (PDFs), and effective potentials for the interparticle\ninteraction are extracted from these PDFs via the Ornstein-Zernike equation\nwith the Percus-Yevick closure. The correlations in the granular structures\noriginating from these effective potentials are checked against the originating\nPDF using standard Monte Carlo simulations, and we find in general an excellent\nagreement. The resulting effective potentials show an increase of the spatial\ncorrelation at contact with the decreasing values of the restitution\ncoefficient, and a general tendency of the potentials to display deeper wells\nfor more dissipative dynamics. An exception to this general trend appears for\ncertain combinations of density and forcing, where resonant bouncing increases\ncorrelations.\n", "  We consider the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process with a broad initial probability\ndistribution (Levy distribution), which exhibits so-called non-spectral modes.\nThe relaxation of such modes differs from those determined from the parameters\nof the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation. The first non-spectral mode is\nshown to govern the relaxation process and allows for estimation of the initial\ndistribution's Levy index. A method based on continuous wavelet transformation\nis proposed to extract both (spectral and non-spectral) relaxation rates from a\nstochastic data sample.\n", "  Density matrix quantum Monte Carlo (DMQMC) is used to sample exact-on-average\n$N$-body density matrices for uniform electron gas systems of up to 10$^{124}$\nmatrix elements via a stochastic solution of the Bloch equation. The results of\nthese calculations resolve a current debate over the accuracy of the data used\nto parametrize finite-temperature density functionals. Exchange-correlation\nenergies calculated using the real-space restricted path-integral formalism and\nthe $k$-space configuration path-integral formalism disagree by up to\n$\\sim$$10$\\% at certain reduced temperatures $T/T_F \\le 0.5$ and densities $r_s\n\\le 1$. Our calculations confirm the accuracy of the configuration\npath-integral Monte Carlo results available at high density and bridge the gap\nto lower densities, providing trustworthy data in the regime typical of\nplanetary interiors and solids subject to laser irradiation. We demonstrate\nthat DMQMC can calculate free energies directly and present exact free energies\nfor $T/T_F \\ge 1$ and $r_s \\le 2$.\n", "  Swimming cells and microorganisms are a critical component of many biological\nprocesses. In order to better interpret experimental studies of low Reynolds\nnumber swimming, we combine experimental and numerical methods to perform an\nanalysis of the flow-field around the swimming nematode Caenorhabditis elegans.\nWe first use image processing and particle tracking velocimetry to extract the\nbody shape, kinematics, and flow-fields around the nematode. We then construct\na three-dimensional model using the experimental swimming kinematics and employ\na boundary element method to simulate flow-fields, obtaining very good\nquantitative agreement with experiment. We use this numerical model to show\nthat calculation of flow shear rates using purely planar data results in\nsignificant underestimates of the true three-dimensional value. Applying\nsymmetry arguments, validated against numerics, we demonstrate that the\nout-of-plane contribution can be accounted for via incompressibility and\ntherefore simply calculated from particle tracking velocimetry. Our results\nshow how fundamental fluid mechanics considerations may be used to improve the\naccuracy of measurements in biofluiddynamics.\n", "  In this letter we show that the recently theoretically predicted and\nexperimentally observed \"orbital Feshbach resonance\" in alkali-earth-like\nYb-173 atom is a narrow resonance in energy, while it is hundreds Gauss wide in\nterm of magnetic field strength, taking the advantage that the magnetic moment\ndifference between the open and closed channels is quite small. Therefore this\nis an ideal platform for the experimental realization of a strongly interacting\nFermi superfluid with narrow resonance. We show that the transition temperature\nfor the Fermi superfluid in this system, especially at the BCS side of the\nresonance, is even higher than that in a wide resonance, which is also due to\nthe narrow character of this resonance. Our results will encourage experimental\nefforts to realize Fermi superfluid in the alkali-earth-like Yb-173 system, the\nproperties of which will be complementary to extensively studied Fermi\nsuperfluids nearby a wide resonance in alkali K-40 and Li-6 systems.\n", "  Motivated by TeV-scale neutrino mass models, we propose a systematic\ntreatment of heavy neutrino $(N)$ production at hadron colliders. Our simple\nand efficient modeling of the vector boson fusion (VBF) $W^\\pm\\gamma\\rightarrow\nN\\ell^\\pm$ and $N\\ell^\\pm+nj$ signal definitions resolve collinear and soft\ndivergences that have plagued past studies, and is applicable to other\ncolor-singlet processes, e.g., associated Higgs $(W^\\pm h)$, sparticle\n$(\\tilde{\\ell}^\\pm\\tilde{\\nu_\\ell})$, and charged Higgs $(h^{\\pm\\pm}h^{\\mp})$\nproduction. We present, for the first time, a comparison of all leading $N$\nproduction modes, including both gluon fusion (GF) $gg\\rightarrow\nZ^*/h^*\\rightarrow N\\overset{(-)}{\\nu_\\ell}$ and VBF. We obtain fully\ndifferential results up to next-to-leading order (NLO) in QCD accuracy using a\nMonte Carlo tool chain linking FeynRules, N{\\small LO}CT, and\nMadGraph5\\_aMC@NLO. Associated model files are publicly available. At the 14\nTeV LHC, the leading order GF rate is small and comparable to the NLO\n$N\\ell^\\pm+1j$ rate; at a future 100 TeV Very Large Hadron Collider, GF\ndominates for $m_N={300-1500}$ GeV, beyond which VBF takes lead.\n", "  We investigate cosmological models in a recently proposed geometrical theory\nof gravity, in which the scalar field appears as part of the space-time\ngeometry. We extend the previous theory to include a scalar potential in the\naction. We solve the vacuum field equations for different choices of the scalar\npotential and give a detailed analysis of the solutions. We show that in some\ncases a cosmological scenario is found that seems to suggest the appearance of\na geometric phase transition. We build a toy model, in which the accelerated\nexpansion of the early universe is driven by pure geometry.\n", "  We study the relation between the Jordan-Einstein frame transition and the\npossible description of the crossing of singularities in flat Friedmann\nuniverses, using the fact that the regular evolution in one frame can\ncorrespond to crossing singularities in the other frame. We show that some\ninteresting effects arise in simple models such as one with a massless scalar\nfield or another wherein the potential is constant in the Einstein frame. The\ndynamics in these models and in their conformally coupled counterparts are\ndescribed in detail, and a method for the continuation of such cosmological\nevolutions beyond the singularity is developed. We compare our approach with\nsome other, recently developed, approaches to the problem of the crossing of\nsingularities.\n", "  We present results of the time blocking approximation (TBA) on giant\nresonances in light, medium and heavy mass nuclei. The TBA is an extension of\nthe widely used random-phase approximation (RPA) adding complex configurations\nby coupling to phonon excitations. A new method for handling the\nsingle-particle continuum is developed and applied in the present calculations.\nWe investigate in detail the dependence of the numerical results on the size of\nthe single particle space and the number of phonons as well as on nuclear\nmatter properties. Our approach is self-consistent, based on an energy-density\nfunctional of Skyrme type where we used seven different parameter sets. The\nnumerical results are compared with experimental data.\n", "  Quantum systems in contact with an environment display a rich physics\nemerging from the interplay between dissipative and Hamiltonian terms. Here we\nfocus on the role of the geometry of the coupling between the system and the\nbaths. In the specific we consider a dissipative boundary driven ladder in\npresence of a gauge field which can be implemented with ion microtraps arrays.\nWe show that, depending on the geometry, the currents imposed by the baths can\nbe strongly affected by the gauge field resulting in non-equilibrium phase\ntransitions. In different phases both the magnitude of the current and its\nspatial distribution are significantly different. These findings allow for\nnovel strategies to manipulate and control transport properties in quantum\nsystems.\n", "  We investigate a series of manganese oxides, the\nLa0.225Pr0.4(Ca1-xSrx)0.375MnO3 system. The x = 0 sample is a prototype\ncompound for the study of phase separation in manganites, where ferromagnetic\nand charge ordered antiferromagnetic phases coexist. Replacing Ca2+ by Sr2+\ngradually turns the system into a homogeneous ferromagnet. Our results show\nthat the material structure plays a major role in the observed magnetic\nproperties. On cooling, at temperatures below 100 K, a strong contraction of\nthe lattice is followed by an increase in the magnetization. This is observed\nboth through thermal expansion and magnetostriction measurements, providing\ndistinct evidence of magneto-elastic coupling in these phase separated\ncompounds.\n", "  For the case of spin zero we construct conjugate pairs of operators on Fock\nspace. On states multiplied by polarization vectors coordinate operators Q\nconjugate to the momentum operator P exist. The massive case is derived from a\ngeometrical quantity, the massless case is realized by taking the limit mass\ngoing to zero on the one hand, on the other from conformal transformations.\nCrucial is the norm problem of the states on which the Q's act: they determine\neventually how many independent conjugate pairs exist. It is intriguing that\nlight wedge variables and hence the wedge-local case seems to be preferred.\n", "  Pre-recombination acoustic oscillations induce non-adiabatic perturbations\nbetween baryons and dark matter, corresponding to a constant relative-density\n$\\delta_{bc}$ and decaying relative-velocity perturbation $\\vec{v}_{bc}$. Due\nto their significant large-scale correlations and prominent baryon acoustic\noscillation (BAO) features, these modes are potentially important for the use\nof the BAO as standard ruler. We present a complete treatment of the effects of\nthe baryon-CDM perturbations on galaxy clustering in the context of a rigorous\nperturbative bias expansion. The leading effects are proportional to\n$\\delta_{bc}$ and $\\theta_{bc} = \\partial_i v_{bc}^i$. We estimate the\nmagnitude of these terms through the excursion set approach. The contribution\nfrom $v_{bc}^2$, which has attracted significant attention recently,\ncontributes at subleading (1-loop) order. The relative-density contribution\n$\\delta_{bc}$ is expected to be by far the largest contribution. We also point\nout contributions to the galaxy velocity bias, the largest of which is simply\n$v_{bc}$, leading to a term $\\propto \\mu^2\\theta_{bc}$ in the redshift-space\ngalaxy power spectrum $P_g^s(k,\\mu)$. Complete expressions of the galaxy power\nspectrum at 1-loop order are given, which contain several new terms.\n", "  We use a sample of 97 galaxies selected from the ALFALFA 21cm survey to make\nan accurate measurement of the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation (BTFR). These\ngalaxies are specifically selected to be heavily gas-dominated (Mgas/M* >~ 2.7)\nand to be oriented edge-on. The former property ensures that the error on the\ngalactic baryonic mass is small, despite the large systematic uncertainty\ninvolved in galactic stellar mass estimates. The latter property means that\nrotational velocities can be derived directly from the width of the 21cm\nemission line, without any need for inclination corrections. We measure a slope\nfor the linewidth-based BTFR of alpha = 3.75 +- 0.11, a value that is somewhat\nsteeper than (but in broad agreement with) previous literature results. The\nrelation is remarkably tight, with almost all galaxies being located within a\nperpendicular distance of +- 0.1 dex from the best fit line. The low\nobservational error budget for our sample enables us to establish that, despite\nits tightness, the measured linewidth-based BTFR has some small (i.e.,\nnon-zero) intrinsic scatter. We furthermore find a systematic difference in the\nBTFR of galaxies with \"double-horned\" 21cm line profiles and those with\n\"peaked\" profiles. When we restrict our sample of galaxies to objects in the\nformer category, we measure a slightly steeper slope of alpha = 4.13 +- 0.15.\nOverall, the high-accuracy measurement of the BTFR presented in this article is\nintended as a reliable observational benchmark against which to test\ntheoretical expectations. Here we consider a representative set of\nsemi-analytic models and hydrodynamic simulations in the LCDM context, as well\nas MOND. In the near future, interferometric follow-up observations of several\nsample members will enable us to further refine the BTFR measurement, and make\nsharper comparisons with theoretical models.\n", "  We study the semi-leptonic and non-leptonic decays of $B_c$ meson to $D$-wave\ncharmonia, namely, $\\eta_{c2}(1^1\\!D_2)$, $\\psi_2(1^3\\!D_2)$, and\n$\\psi_3(1^3\\!D_3)$. In our calculations, the instantaneous Bethe-Salpeter\nmethod is applied to achieve the hadronic matrix elements. This method includes\nrelativistic corrections which are important especially for the higher orbital\nexcited states. For the semi-leptonic decay channels with electron as the final\nlepton, we get the branching ratios $\\mathcal{B}[B_c \\rightarrow\n\\eta_{c2}e\\bar{\\nu}_e] = 5.9^{-0.8}_{+1.0}\\times 10^{-4}$, $\\mathcal{B}[B_c\n\\rightarrow \\psi_2e\\bar{\\nu}_e]=1.5^{-0.2}_{+0.3}\\times 10^{-4}$, and\n$\\mathcal{B}[B_c \\rightarrow \\psi_3e\\bar{\\nu}_e]=3.5^{-0.6}_{+0.8}\\times\n10^{-4}$. The transition form factors, forward-backward asymmetries, and lepton\nspectra in these processes are also presented. For the non-leptonic decay\nchannels, those with $\\rho$ as the lighter meson have the largest branching\nratios, $\\mathcal{B}[B_c \\rightarrow \\eta_{c2}\\rho] = 8.1^{-1.0}_{+1.0}\\times\n10^{-4}$, $\\mathcal{B}[B_c \\rightarrow \\psi_2\\rho]=9.6^{-1.0}_{+1.0}\\times\n10^{-5}$, and $\\mathcal{B}[B_c \\rightarrow \\psi_3\\rho]=4.1^{-0.7}_{+0.8}\\times\n10^{-4}$.\n", "  In self assembled III-V semiconductor quantum dots, valence holes have longer\nspin coherence times than the conduction electrons, due to their weaker\ncoupling to nuclear spin bath fluctuations. Prolonging hole spin stability\nrelies on a better understanding of the hole to nuclear spin hyperfine coupling\nwhich we address both in experiment and theory in the symmetric (111)\nGaAs/AlGaAs droplet dots. In magnetic fields applied along the growth axis, we\ncreate a strong nuclear spin polarization detected through the positively\ncharged trion X$^+$ Zeeman and Overhauser splittings. The observation of four\nclearly resolved photoluminescence lines - a unique property of the (111)\nnanosystems - allows us to measure separately the electron and hole\ncontribution to the Overhauser shift. The hyperfine interaction for holes is\nfound to be about five times weaker than that for electrons. Our theory shows\nthat this ratio depends not only on intrinsic material properties but also on\nthe dot shape and carrier confinement through the heavy-hole mixing, an\nopportunity for engineering the hole-nuclear spin interaction by tuning dot\nsize and shape.\n", "  A few-body approach relying on static line broadening theory is developed to\ntreat the spectroscopy of a single Rydberg excitation to a trilobite-like state\nimmersed in a high density ultracold medium. The present theoretical framework\nimplements the compact treatment of polyatomic Rydberg molecules by Eiles et\nal. [arXiv:1601.06881], allowing for an accurate treatment of a large number of\nperturbers within the Rydberg orbit. This system exhibits two unique spectral\nsignatures: its lineshape depends on the Rydberg quantum number $n$ but,\nstrikingly, is independent of the density of the medium, and it is\ncharacterized by sharply peaked features reflecting the oscillatory structure\nof the potential energy landscape.\n", "  We report on the results of the E06-014 experiment performed at Jefferson Lab\nin Hall A, where a precision measurement of the twist-3 matrix element $d_2$ of\nthe neutron ($d_{2}^{n}$) was conducted. This quantity represents the average\ncolor Lorentz force a struck quark experiences in a deep inelastic electron\nscattering event off a neutron due to its interaction with the hadronizing\nremnants. This color force was determined from a linear combination of the\nthird moments of the spin structure functions $g_1$ and $g_2$ on $^{3}$He after\nnuclear corrections had been applied to these moments. The kinematics included\ntwo average $Q^{2}$ bins of $3.2$ GeV$^{2}$ and $4.3$ GeV$^{2}$, and\nBjorken-$x$ $0.25 \\leq x \\leq 0.90$ covering the DIS and resonance regions. We\nfound $d_2^n$ to be small and negative for $<Q^{2}> = 3.2$ GeV$^{2}$, and\nsmaller for $<Q^{2}> = 4.3$ GeV$^{2}$, consistent with a lattice QCD\ncalculation. The twist-4 matrix element $f_{2}^{n}$ was extracted by combining\nour $d_{2}^{n}$ with the world data on $\\Gamma_{1}^{n} = \\int_{0}^{1} g_{1}^{n}\ndx$. We found $f_{2}^{n}$ to be roughly an order of magnitude larger than\n$d_{2}^{n}$. Utilizing the extracted $d_{2}^{n}$ and $f_{2}^{n}$ data, we\nseparated the color force into its electric and magnetic components,\n$F_{E}^{y,n}$ and $F_{B}^{y,n}$, and found them to be equal and opposite in\nmagnitude, in agreement with instanton model predictions but not with those\nfrom QCD sum rules. Additionally, we have extracted the neutron virtual\nphoton-nucleon asymmetry $A_{1}^{n}$, the structure function ratio\n$g_{1}^{n}/F_{1}^{n}$, and the quark ratios $(\\Delta u + \\Delta \\bar{u})/(u +\n\\bar{u})$ and $(\\Delta d + \\Delta \\bar{d})/(d + \\bar{d})$. These results were\nfound to be consistent with DIS world data and with the prediction of the\nconstituent quark model but at odds with those of perturbative QCD at large\n$x$.\n", "  Entangling two remote quantum systems which never interact directly is an\nessential primitive in quantum information science and forms the basis for the\nmodular architecture of quantum computing. When protocols to generate these\nremote entangled pairs rely on using traveling single photon states as carriers\nof quantum information, they can be made robust to photon losses, unlike\nschemes that rely on continuous variable states. However, efficiently detecting\nsingle photons is challenging in the domain of superconducting quantum circuits\nbecause of the low energy of microwave quanta. Here, we report the realization\nof a robust form of concurrent remote entanglement based on a novel microwave\nphoton detector implemented in the superconducting circuit quantum\nelectrodynamics (cQED) platform of quantum information. Remote entangled pairs\nwith a fidelity of $0.57\\pm0.01$ are generated at $200$ Hz. Our experiment\nopens the way for the implementation of the modular architecture of quantum\ncomputation with superconducting qubits.\n", "  Plasmons in van der Waals heterostructures comprised of graphene and related\nlayered materials demonstrate deep subwavelength confinement and large\npropagation length. In this letter, we show that graphene-insulator-graphene\ntunnel structures can serve as plasmonic gain media. The gain stems from the\nstimulated electron tunneling accompanied by the emission of coherent plasmons\nunder interlayer population inversion. The probability of tunneling with\nplasmon emission appears to be resonantly large at certain values of frequency\nand interlayer voltage corresponding to the transitions between electron states\nwith collinear momenta - a feature unique to the linear band structure of\ngraphene. The dispersion of plasmons undergoes a considerable transformation\ndue to the tunneling as well, demonstrating negative group velocity in several\nfrequency ranges.\n", "  We study sequential measurement scenarios where the system is repeatedly\nsubjected to the same measurement process. We first provide examples of such\nrepeated measurements where further repetitions of the measurement do not\nincrease our knowledge on the system after some finite number of measurement\nsteps. We also prove, however, that repeating the L\\\"uders measurement of an\nunsharp two-outcome observable never saturates in this sense, and we\ncharacterize the observable measured in the limit of infinitely many\nrepetitions. Our result implies that a repeated measurement can be used to\ncorrect the inherent noise of an unsharp observable.\n", "  Knowledge gained through X-ray crystallography fostered structural\ndetermination of materials and greatly facilitated the development of modern\nscience and technology in the past century. Atomic details of sample structures\nis achievable by X-ray crystallography, however, it is only applied to\ncrystalline structures. Imaging techniques based on X-ray coherent diffraction\nor zone plates are capable of resolving the internal structure of\nnon-crystalline materials at nanoscales, but it is still a challenge to achieve\natomic resolution. Here we demonstrate a novel lensless Fourier-transform ghost\nimaging method with pseudo-thermal hard X-rays by measuring the second-order\nintensity correlation function of the light. We show that high resolution\nFourier-transform diffraction pattern of a complex amplitude sample can be\nachieved at Fresnel region and the amplitude and phase distributions of a\nsample in spatial domain can be retrieved successfully. The method of lensless\nX-ray Fourier-transform ghost imaging extends X-ray crystallography to\nnon-crystalline samples, and its spatial resolution is limited only by the\nwavelength of the X-ray, thus atomic resolution should be routinely obtainable.\nSince highly coherent X-ray source is not required, comparing to conventional\nX-ray coherent diffraction imaging, the method can be implemented with\nlaboratory X-ray sources, and it also provides a potential solution for\nlensless diffraction imaging with fermions, such as neutron and electron where\nthe intensive coherent source usually is not available.\n", "  Numerical simulations of QCD-like theories in which the number of flavors is\nadjusted so that the beta function is very small, but confinement and chiral\nsymmetry breaking nevertheless take place, appear to reveal the presence of a\nflavor-singlet scalar meson which can be as light as the pions. Because the\nbreaking of dilatation symmetry, quantified by the beta function, is small\nrelative to QCD, a possible explanation is that the scalar meson is a pseudo\nNambu-Goldstone boson associated with the approximate dilatation symmetry. We\nuse this observation to systematically develop a low-energy effective action\nthat accounts for both the pions and the \"dilatonic\" scalar meson. In order to\njustify the power counting that controls the couplings of the dilatonic meson\nwe invoke the Veneziano limit, in which the number of\nfundamental-representation flavors $N_f$ grows in proportion with the number of\ncolors $N_c$, while the ratio $N_f/N_c$ is kept close to, but below, the\ncritical value where the conformal window is entered.\n", "  We study multipartite Bell nonlocality in a framework native of multipartite\nEinstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering scenarios with a single trusted\nmeasurement device. We derive a closed-form necessary and sufficient criterion\nfor systems composed of a qubit and N-1 untrusted black-box measurement devices\nto violate -- under general dichotomic measurements on the qubit -- a generic\nBell inequality from a broad family of linear inequalities with arbitrarily\nmany outputs for the N-1 untrusted devices and inputs for all N parties. The\noptimal quantum measurements for maximal violation are also obtained. For two\nusers, and two inputs and two outputs per user, our criterion becomes necessary\nand sufficient for Bell nonlocality. Furthermore, in that setting, its form\ngeneralizes recently obtained steering inequalities, which allows us to provide\nuseful feedback from nonlocality to the detection of steering. Our findings\nconstitute a practical tool for the study of the interplay between EPR steering\nand Bell nonlocality, with potential applications in multipartite information\nprocessing.\n", "  The existence of non-local quantum correlations is certainly the most\nimportant specific property of the quantum world. However, it is a challenging\ntask to distinguish correlations of classical origin from genuine quantum\ncorrelations, especially when the system involves more than two parties, for\nwhich different partitions must be simultaneously considered. In the case of\nmixed states, intermediate levels of correlations must be introduced, coined by\nthe name inseparability. In this work, we revisit in more detail such a concept\nin the context of continuous-variable quantum optics. We consider a six-partite\nquantum state that we have effectively generated by the parametric\ndownconversion of a femtosecond frequency comb, the full 12 x 12 covariance\nmatrix of which has been experimentally determined. We show that, though this\nstate does not exhibit \"genuine entanglement\", it is undoubtedly\nmultipartite-entangled. The consideration of not only the entanglement of\nindividual mode-decompositions but also of combinations of those solves the\npuzzle and exemplifies the importance of studying different categories of\nmultipartite entanglement.\n", "  For a conformally-coupled scalar field we obtain the conformally-related\nEinstein-Langevin equations, using appropriate transformations for all the\nquantities in the equations between two conformally-related spacetimes. In\nparticular, we analyze the transformations of the influence action, the stress\nenergy tensor, the noise kernel and the dissipation kernel. In due course the\nfluctuation-dissipation relation is also discussed. The analysis in this paper\nthereby facilitates a general solution to the Einstein-Langevin equation once\nthe solution of the equation in a simpler, conformally-related spacetime is\nknown. For example, from the Minkowski solution of Martin and Verdaguer, those\nof the Einstein-Langevin equations in conformally-flat spacetimes, especially\nfor spatially-flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker models, can be readily obtained.\n", "  Fermi-LAT observations of the Galactic Center (GC) have revealed a\nspherically- symmetric excess of GeV gamma rays extending to at least 10 deg\nfrom the dynamical center of the Galaxy. A critical uncertainty in extracting\nthe intensity, spectrum, and morphology of this excess concerns the accuracy of\nastrophysical diffuse gamma-ray emission models near the GC. Recently, it has\nbeen noted that many diffuse emission models utilize a cosmic-ray injection\nrate far below that predicted based on the observed star formation rate in the\nCentral Molecular Zone. In this study, we add a cosmic-ray injection component\nwhich non-linearly traces the Galactic H2 density determined in\nthree-dimensions, and find that the associated gamma-ray emission is degenerate\nwith many properties of the GC gamma-ray excess. In models that utilize a large\nsideband (40x40 deg surrounding the GC) to normalize the best-fitting diffuse\nemission models, the intensity of the GC excess decreases by a factor of 2, and\nthe morphology of the excess becomes less peaked and less spherically\nsymmetric. In models which utilize a smaller region of interest (15x15 deg) the\naddition of an excess template instead suppresses the intensity of the best-fit\nastrophysical diffuse emission, and the GC excess is rather resilient to\nchanges in the details of the astrophysical diffuse modeling. In both analyses,\nthe addition of a GC excess template still provides a statistically significant\nimprovement to the overall fit to the gamma-ray data. We also implement\nadvective winds at the GC, and find that the Fermi-LAT data strongly prefer\noutflows of order several hundred km/s, whose role is to efficiently advect\nlow-energy cosmic rays from the Galactic center. Finally, we perform numerous\ntests of our models, and conclude that they significantly improve our\nunderstanding of multi-wavelength non-thermal emission from the GC.\n", "  Addressing subwavelength object and displacement is crucial in optical\nnanometrology. We show in this Letter that nano antennas with subwavelength\nstructures can be addressed precisely by incident beams with singularity. This\naccurate feeding beyond the diffraction limit can lead to dynamic control of\nthe unidirectional scattering in the far field. The combination of polarization\ndiscontinuity of the incoming singular beam, along with the rapid phase\nvariation near the antenna leads to remarkable sensitivity of the far field\nscattering to displacement at deep subwavelength scale. This opens a far field\ndeep subwavelength postion detection method based on the interaction of\nsingular optics with nano antennas.\n", "  The Fermi collaboration identified a possible electromagnetic counterpart of\nthe gravitational wave event of September 14, 2015. Our goal is to provide an\nunsupervised data analysis algorithm to identify similar events in Fermi's\nGamma-ray Burst Monitor CTTE data stream. We are looking for signals that are\ntypically weak. Therefore, they can only be found by a careful analysis of\ncount rates of all detectors and energy channels simultaneously. Our\nAutomatized Detector Weight Optimization (ADWO) method consists of a search for\nthe signal, and a test of its significance. We developed ADWO, a virtual\ndetector analysis tool for multi-channel multi-detector signals, and performed\nsuccessful searches for short transients in the data-streams. We have\nidentified GRB150522B, as well as possible electromagnetic candidates of the\ntransients GW150914 and LVT151012. ADWO is an independently developed,\nunsupervised data analysis tool that only relies on the raw data of the Fermi\nsatellite. It can therefore provide a strong, independent test to any\nelectromagnetic signal accompanying future gravitational wave observations.\n", "  Colloidal bodies of irregular shape rotate as they descend under gravity in\nsolution. This rotational response provides a means of bringing a dispersion of\nidentical bodies into a synchronized rotation with the same orientation using\nprogrammed forcing. We use the notion of statistical entropy to derive bounds\non the rate of synchronization. These bounds apply generally to dynamical\nsystems with stable periodic motion with a phase $\\phi(t)$, when subjected to\nan impulsive perturbation. The impulse causes a change of phase expressible as\na phase map $\\psi(\\phi)$. We derive an upper limit on the average change of\nentropy $\\left<\\Delta H\\right>$ in terms of this phase map; when this limit is\nnegative, alignment must occur. For systems that have achieved a low entropy,\nthe $\\left<\\Delta H\\right>$ approaches this upper limit.\n", "  We investigate the effects of self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) on the\ntidal stripping and evaporation of satellite galaxies in a Milky Way-like host.\nWe use a suite of five zoom-in, dark-matter-only simulations, two with\nvelocity-independent SIDM cross sections, two with velocity-dependent SIDM\ncross sections, and one cold dark matter simulation for comparison. After\ncarefully assigning stellar mass to satellites at infall, we find that stars\nare stripped at a higher rate in SIDM than in CDM. In contrast, the total bound\ndark matter mass loss rate is minimally affected, with subhalo evaporation\nhaving negligible effects on satellites for viable SIDM models. Centrally\nlocated stars in SIDM haloes disperse out to larger radii as cores grow.\nConsequently, the half-light radius of satellites increases, stars become more\nvulnerable to tidal stripping, and the stellar mass function is suppressed. We\nfind that the ratio of core radius to tidal radius accurately predicts the\nrelative strength of enhanced SIDM stellar stripping. Velocity-independent SIDM\nmodels show a modest increase in the stellar stripping effect with satellite\nmass, whereas velocity-dependent SIDM models show a large increase in this\neffect towards lower masses, making observations of ultra-faint dwarfs prime\ntargets for distinguishing between and constraining SIDM models. Due to small\ncores in the largest satellites of velocity-dependent SIDM, no identifiable\nimprint is left on the all-sky properties of the stellar halo. While our\nresults focus on SIDM, the main physical mechanism of enhanced tidal stripping\nof stars apply similarly to satellites with cores formed via other means.\n", "  The pion electromagnetic form factor and two-pion production in\nelectron-positron collisions are simultaneously fitted by a vector dominance\nmodel evolving to perturbative QCD at large momentum transfer. This model was\npreviously successful in simultaneously fitting the nucleon electromagnetic\nform factors (spacelike region) and the electromagnetic production of\nnucleon-antinucleon pairs (timelike region). For this pion case dispersion\nrelations are used to produce the analytic connection of the spacelike and\ntimelike regions. The fit to all the data is good, especially for the newer\nsets of time-like data. The description of high-$q^2$ data, in the time-like\nregion, requires one more meson with $\\rho$ quantum numbers than listed in the\n2014 Particle Data Group review.\n", "  The MINERvA experiment observes an excess of events containing\nelectromagnetic showers relative to the expectation from Monte Carlo\nsimulations in neutral-current neutrino interactions with mean beam energy of\n4.5 GeV on a hydrocarbon target. The excess is characterized and found to be\nconsistent with neutral-current neutral pion production with a broad energy\ndistribution peaking at 7 GeV and a total cross section of 0.26 +- 0.02 (stat)\n+- 0.08 (sys) x 10^{-39} cm^{2}. The angular distribution, electromagnetic\nshower energy, and spatial distribution of the energy depositions of the excess\nare consistent with expectations from neutrino neutral-current diffractive\nneutral pion production from hydrogen in the hydrocarbon target. These data\ncomprise the first direct experimental observation and constraint for a\nreaction that poses an important background process in neutrino oscillation\nexperiments searching for muon neutrino to electron neutrino oscillations.\n", "  We present the first experimental evidence, supported by theory and\nsimulation, of spatiotemporal optical vortices (STOVs). Quantized STOVs are a\nfundamental element of the nonlinear collapse and subsequent propagation of\nshort optical pulses in material media. A STOV consists of a ring-shaped null\nin the electromagnetic field about which the phase is spiral, forming a dynamic\ntorus which is concentric with and tracks the propagating pulse. Depending on\nthe sign of the material dispersion, the local electromagnetic energy flow is\nsaddle or spiral about the STOV. STOVs are born and evolve conserving\ntopological charge; they can be simultaneously created in pairs with opposite\nwindings, or generated from a point null. Our results, here obtained for\noptical pulse collapse and filamentation in air, are generalizable to broad\nclass of nonlinearly propagating waves.\n", "  We construct exactly solved commuting projector Hamiltonian lattice models\nfor all known 2+1d fermionic symmetry protected topological phases (SPTs) with\non-site unitary symmetry group $G_f = G \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2^f$, where $G$ is\nfinite and $\\mathbb{Z}_2^f$ is the fermion parity symmetry. In particular, our\nmodels transcend the class of group supercohomology models, which realize some,\nbut not all, fermionic SPTs in 2+1d. A natural ingredient in our construction\nis a discrete form of the spin structure of the 2d spatial surface $M$ on which\nour model is defined, namely a `Kasteleyn' orientation of a certain graph\nassociated with the lattice. As a special case, our construction yields\ncommuting projector models for all $8$ members of the $\\mathbb{Z}_8$\nclassification of 2d fermionic SPTs with $G = \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n", "  Dark matter annihilation or decay could have a significant impact on the\nionisation and thermal history of the universe. In this paper, we study the\npotential contribution of dark matter annihilation (s-wave- or\np-wave-dominated) or decay to cosmic reionisation, via the production of\nelectrons, positrons and photons. We map out the possible perturbations to the\nionisation and thermal histories of the universe due to dark matter processes,\nover a broad range of velocity-averaged annihilation cross-sections/decay\nlifetimes and dark matter masses. We have employed recent numerical studies of\nthe efficiency with which annihilation/decay products induce heating and\nionization in the intergalactic medium, and in this work extended them down to\na redshift of $1+z = 4$ for two different reionisation scenarios. We also\nimprove on earlier studies by using the results of detailed structure formation\nmodels of dark matter haloes and subhaloes that are consistent with up-to-date\n$N$-body simulations, with estimates on the uncertainties that originate from\nthe smallest scales. We find that for dark matter models that are consistent\nwith experimental constraints, a contribution of more than 10% to the\nionisation fraction at reionisation is disallowed for all annihilation\nscenarios. Such a contribution is possible only for decays into\nelectron/positron pairs, for light dark matter with mass $m_\\chi \\lesssim $ 100\nMeV, and a decay lifetime $\\tau_\\chi \\sim 10^{24} - 10^{25}$ s.\n", "  We investigate in detail the chiral thermal transition of QCD in an improved\nsoft-wall AdS/QCD model with a simply modified 5D conformal mass of the bulk\nscalar field. We also present a calculation in this model for the light meson\nspectra and other low-energy characteristic quantities including the pion form\nfactor, the pi-rho coupling constant and the decay constants of pi, rho, a_1,\nwhich are shown to result in a good agreement with experimental data except for\nthe pion decay constant. The thermal behavior of chiral condensate is studied.\nIt is found that such a simply improved soft-wall model incorporates the\ncrossover behavior of chiral thermal transition indicated by lattice\nsimulations. The expected chiral transition temperature can be obtained.\n", "  For any finite dimensional Hilbert space, we construct explicitly five\northonormal bases such that the corresponding measurements allow for efficient\ntomography of an arbitrary pure quantum state. This means that such\nmeasurements can be used to distinguish an arbitrary pure state from any other\nstate, pure or mixed, and the pure state can be reconstructed from the outcome\ndistribution in a feasible way. The set of measurements we construct is\nindependent of the unknown state, and therefore our results provide a fixed\nscheme for pure state tomography, as opposed to the adaptive (state dependent)\nscheme proposed by Goyeneche et al. in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 115, 090401 (2015)].\nWe show that our scheme is robust with respect to noise in the sense that any\nmeasurement scheme which approximates these measurements well enough is equally\nsuitable for pure state tomography. Finally, we present two convex programs\nwhich can be used to reconstruct the unknown pure state from the measurement\noutcome distributions.\n", "  We study electronic and magnetic properties of the quasi-one-dimensional\nspin-1/2 magnet Ba3Cu3Sc4O12 with a distinct orthogonal connectivity of CuO4\nplaquettes. An effective low-energy model taking into account spin-orbit\ncoupling was constructed by means of first-principles calculations. On this\nbasis a complete microscopic magnetic model of Ba3Cu3Sc4O12, including\nsymmetric and antisymmetric anisotropic exchange interactions, is derived. The\nanisotropic exchanges are obtained from a distinct first-principles numerical\nscheme combining, on one hand, the local density approximation taking into\naccount spin-orbit coupling, and, on the other hand, projection procedure along\nwith the microscopic theory by Toru Moriya. The resulting tensors of the\nsymmetric anisotropy favor collinear magnetic order along the structural chains\nwith the leading ferromagnetic coupling J1 = -9.88 meV. The interchain\ninteractions J8 = 0.21 meV and J5 = 0.093 meV are antiferromagnetic. Quantum\nMonte Carlo simulations demonstrated that the proposed model reproduces the\nexperimental Neel temperature, magnetization and magnetic susceptibility data.\nThe modeling of neutron diffraction data reveals an important role of the\ncovalent Cu-O bonding in Ba3Cu3Sc4O12.\n", "  Mathematical models of pedestrian evacuation and the associated simulation\nsoftware have become essential tools for the assessment of the safety of public\nfacilities and buildings. While a variety of models are now available, their\ncalibration and test against empirical data are generally restricted to global,\naveraged quantities, the statistics compiled from the time series of individual\nescapes (\" microscopic \" statistics) measured in recent experiments are thus\noverlooked. In the same spirit, much research has primarily focused on the\naverage global evacuation time, whereas the whole distribution of evacuation\ntimes over some set of realizations should matter. In the present paper we\npropose and discuss the validity of a simple relation between this distribution\nand the \" microscopic \" statistics, which is theoretically valid in the absence\nof correlations. To this purpose, we develop a minimal cellular automaton, with\nnovel features that afford a semi-quantitative reproduction of the experimental\n\" microscopic \" statistics. We then introduce a process of social contagion of\nimpatient behavior in the model and show that the simple relation under test\nmay dramatically fail at high contagion strengths, the latter being responsible\nfor the emergence of strong correlations in the system. We conclude with\ncomments on the potential practical relevance for safety science of\ncalculations based on \" microscopic \" statistics.\n", "  Super-harmonic injection locking of single nano-contact (NC) spin-torque\nvortex oscillators (STVOs) subject to a small microwave current has been\nexplored. Frequency locking was observed up to the fourth harmonic of the STVO\nfundamental frequency $f_{0}$ in microwave magneto-electronic measurements. The\nlarge frequency tunability of the STVO with respect to $f_{0}$ allowed the\ndevice to be locked to multiple sub-harmonics of the microwave frequency\n$f_{RF}$, or to the same sub-harmonic over a wide range of $f_{RF}$ by tuning\nthe DC current. In general, analysis of the locking range, linewidth, and\namplitude showed that the locking efficiency decreased as the harmonic number\nincreased, as expected for harmonic synchronization of a non-linear oscillator.\nTime-resolved scanning Kerr microscopy (TRSKM) revealed significant differences\nin the spatial character of the magnetization dynamics of states locked to the\nfundamental and harmonic frequencies, suggesting significant differences in the\ncore trajectories within the same device. Super-harmonic injection locking of a\nNC-STVO may open up possibilities for devices such as nanoscale frequency\ndividers, while differences in the core trajectory may allow mutual\nsynchronisation to be achieved in multi-oscillator networks by tuning the\nspatial character of the dynamics within shared magnetic layers.\n", "  We consider the problem of an overdamped Brownian particle moving in\nmultiscale potential with N + 1 characteristic length scales: the macroscale\nand N separated microscales. We show that the coarse-grained dynamics is given\nby an overdamped Langevin equation with respect to the free energy and with a\nspace dependent diffusion tensor, the calculation of which requires the\nsolution of N fully coupled Poisson equations. We study in detail the structure\nof the bifurcation diagram for one-dimensional problems and we show that the\nmultiscale structure in the potential leads to hysteresis effects and to\nnoise-induced transitions. Furthermore, we obtain an explicit formula for the\neffective diffusion coefficient for a self-similar separable potential and we\ninvestigate the limit of infinitely many small scales.\n", "  The possibility of creating different geometries with the help of an extra\nsynthetic dimension in optical lattices is studied. Additional linear potential\nand Raman assisted tunnelings are used to engineer well controlled tunnelings\nbetween available states. The great flexibility of the system allows us to\nobtain different geometries of synthetic lattices with possibility of adding\nsynthetic gauge fields.\n", "  In this paper we study the thermodynamics of rotating black hole solutions\narising from four-dimensional gauged N=2 supergravity. We analyze two different\nsupergravity models, characterized by prepotentials $F = -i X^0 X^1$ and $F=\n-2i \\sqrt{X^0 (X^1)^3}$. The black hole configurations are supported by\nelectromagnetic charges and scalar fields with different kinds of boundary\nconditions. We perform our analysis in the canonical ensemble, where we find a\nfirst order phase transition for a suitable range of charges and angular\nmomentum. We perform the thermodynamic stability check on the configurations.\nUsing the holographic dictionary we interpret the phase transition in terms of\nexpectation values of operators in the dual field theory, which pertains to the\nclass of ABJM theories living on a rotating Einstein universe. We extend the\nanalysis to dyonic configurations as well. Lastly, we show the computation of\nthe on-shell action and mass via holographic renormalization techniques.\n", "  The evolution of high dimensional entanglement in atmospheric turbulence is\ninvestigated. We study the effects of turbulence on photonic states generated\nby spontaneous parametric down-conversion, both theoretically and\nexperimentally. One of the photons propagates through turbulence, while the\nother is left undisturbed. The atmospheric turbulence is simulated by a single\nphase screen based on the Kolmogorov theory of turbulence. The output after\nturbulence is projected into a three-dimensional (qutrit) basis composed of\nspecific Laguerre-Gaussian modes. A full state tomography is performed to\ndetermine the density matrix for each output quantum state. These density\nmatrices are used to determine the amount of entanglement, quantified in terms\nof the negativity, as a function of the scintillation strength. Theoretically,\nthe entanglement is calculated using a single phase screen approximation. We\nobtain good agreement between theory and experiment.\n", "  We analyze the dynamics of Bose polarons in the vicinity of a Feshbach\nresonance between the impurity and host atoms. We compute the radio-frequency\nabsorption spectra for the case when the initial state of the impurity is\nnon-interacting and the final state is strongly interacting. We compare results\nof different theoretical approaches including a single excitation expansion, a\nself-consistent T-matrix method, and a time-dependent coherent state approach.\nOur analysis reveals sharp spectral features arising from metastable states\nwith several Bogoliubov excitations bound to the impurity atom. This surprising\nresult of the interplay of many-body and few-body Efimov type bound state\nphysics can only be obtained by going beyond the commonly used Fr\\\"ohlich model\nand including quasiparticle scattering processes. Close to the resonance we\nfind that strong fluctuations lead to a broad, incoherent absorption spectrum\nwhere no quasi-particle peak can be assigned.\n", "  Sudden failure of a single transmission element in a power grid can induce a\ndomino effect of cascading failures, which can lead to the isolation of a large\nnumber of consumers or even to the failure of the entire grid. Here we present\nresults of the simulation of cascading failures in power grids, using an\nalternating current (AC) model. We first apply this model to a regular square\ngrid topology. For a random placement of consumers and generators on the grid,\nthe probability to find more than a certain number of unsupplied consumers\ndecays as a power law and obeys a scaling law with respect to system size.\nVarying the transmitted power threshold above which a transmission line fails\ndoes not seem to change the power law exponent $q \\approx 1.6$. Furthermore, we\nstudy the influence of the placement of generators and consumers on the number\nof affected consumers and demonstrate that large clusters of generators and\nconsumers are especially vulnerable to cascading failures. As a real-world\ntopology we consider the German high-voltage transmission grid. Applying the\ndynamic AC model and considering a random placement of consumers, we find that\nthe probability to disconnect more than a certain number of consumers depends\nstrongly on the threshold. For large thresholds the decay is clearly\nexponential, while for small ones the decay is slow, indicating a power law\ndecay.\n", "  We test the viability of the Higgs-dilaton model (HDM) compared to the\nevolving dark energy ($w_0 w_a$CDM) model, in which the cosmological constant\nmodel $\\Lambda$CDM is also nested, by using the latest cosmological data that\nincludes the cosmic microwave background temperature, polarization and lensing\ndata from the \\textit{Planck} satellite (2015 data release), the BICEP and Keck\nArray experiments, the Type Ia supernovae from the JLA catalog, the baryon\nacoustic oscillations from CMASS, LOWZ and 6dF, the weak lensing data from the\nCFHTLenS survey and the matter power Spectrum measurements from the SDSS (data\nrelease 7). We find that the values of all cosmological parameters allowed by\nthe Higgs-dilaton inflation model are well within the \\textit{Planck} satellite\n(2015 data release) constraints. In particular, we have that $w_0 =\n-1.0001^{+0.0072}_{-0.0074}$, $w_a = 0.00^{+0.15}_{-0.16}$, $n_s =\n0.9693^{+0.0083}_{-0.0082}$, $\\alpha_s = -0.001^{+0.013}_{-0.014}$ and\n$r_{0.05} = 0.0025^{+0.0017}_{-0.0016}$ (95.5\\%C.L.). We also place new\nstringent constraints on the couplings of the Higgs-dilaton model and we find\nthat $\\xi_{\\chi} < 0.00328$ and $\\xi_h / \\sqrt{\\lambda} =\n59200^{+30000}_{-20000}$ (95.5\\%C.L.). Furthermore, we report that the HDM is\nat a slightly better footing than the $w_0 w_a$CDM model, as they both have\npractically the same chi-square, i.e. $\\Delta \\chi^2 = \\chi^2_{w_0\nw_a\\mathrm{CDM}}-\\chi^2_{\\mathrm{HDM}}=0.18$, with the HDM model having two\nfewer parameters. Finally Bayesian evidence favors equally the two models, with\nthe HDM being preferred by the AIC and DIC information criteria.\n", "  Here we present the tetragonal stoichiometric Heusler compound Pt$_2$MnGa\nwith the noncollinear AFM order stable up to 350 K. It is resolved by the\nneutron diffraction as a helical spiral propagating along the tetragonal axis.\nAb-initio calculations suggest a pure exchange origin of the spiral and explain\nits helical character being stabilized by a large basal plane\nmagnetocrystalline anisotropy (MCA). Together with the inversion-symmetric\ncrystal structure, this provides a bi-stability of a spiral with respect to the\nright- and left-handed magnetic helices. Despite the large MCA, the long period\nof a helix might greatly facilitate the switch of the helicity by the\nprecessional reorientation, suggesting Pt$_2$MnGa as a potential candidate for\nthe vector-helicity based non-volatile magnetic memory.\n", "  Recent progress in the determination of hadronic matrix elements has revealed\na tension between the measured value of $\\epsilon_K^{\\prime}/\\epsilon_K$, which\nquantifies direct $CP$ violation in $K \\to \\pi\\pi$ decays, and the\nStandard-Model prediction. The well-understood indirect $CP$ violation encoded\nin the quantity $\\epsilon_K$ typically precludes large new-physics\ncontributions to $\\epsilon_K^{\\prime}/\\epsilon_K$ and challenges such an\nexplanation of the discrepancy. We show that it is possible to cure the\n$\\epsilon_K^{\\prime}/\\epsilon_K$ anomaly in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard\nModel with squark masses above 3 TeV without overshooting $\\epsilon_K$. This\nsolution exploits two features of supersymmetry: the possibility of large\nisospin-breaking contributions (enhancing $\\epsilon_K^{\\prime}$) and the\nMajorana nature of gluinos (permitting a suppression of $\\epsilon_K$). Our\nsolution involves no fine-tuning of $CP$ phases or other parameters.\n", "  We determine the renormalization constants for flavor non-singlet fermion\nbilinear operators of M\\\"obius domain-wall fermions. The renormalization\ncondition is imposed on the correlation functions in the coordinate space, such\nthat the non-perturbative lattice calculation reproduces the perturbatively\ncalculated counterpart at short distances. The perturbative expansion is\nprecise as the coefficients are available up to $O(\\alpha_s^4)$. We employ\n$2+1$-flavor lattice ensembles at three lattice spacings in the range\n0.044--0.080~fm.\n", "  We study the observability of the Higgs mode in BEC-BCS crossover. The\nobservability of Higgs mode is investigated by calculating the spectral weight\nfunctions of the amplitude fluctuation below the critical transition\ntemperature. At zero temperature, we find that there are two sharp peaks on the\nspectral function of the amplitude fluctuation attributed to Goldstone and\nHiggs modes respectively. As the system goes from BCS to BEC side, there is\nstrong enhancement of spectral weight transfer from the Higgs to Goldstone\nmode. However, even at the unitary regime where the Lorentz invariance is lost,\nthe sharp feature of Higgs mode still exists. We specifically calculate the\nfinite temperature spectral function of amplitude fluctuation at the unitary\nregime and show that the Higgs mode is observable at the temperature that\npresent experiments can reach.\n", "  We study Higgs boson plus two high energy jets production at the LHC in the\nkinematics where the two jets are well separated in rapidity. The partonic\nprocesses are dominated by the t-channel weak boson fusion (WBF) and gluon\nfusion (GF) contributions. We derive the associated QCD resummation formalism\nfor the correlation analysis where the total transverse momentum q_\\perp of the\nHiggs boson and two jets is small. Because of different color structures, the\nresummation results lead to distinguished behaviors: the WBF contribution peaks\nat relative low q_\\perp while all GF channel contributions are strongly\nde-correlated and spread to a much wider q_\\perp range. By applying a kinematic\ncut on q_\\perp, one can effectively increase the WBF signal to the GF\nbackground by a significant factor. This greatly strengthens the ability to\ninvestigate the WBF channel in Higgs boson production and study the couplings\nof Higgs to electroweak bosons.\n", "  Non-equilibrium stochastic dynamics of several active Brownian systems are\nmodeled in terms of non-linear velocity dependent force. In general, this force\nmay consist of both even and odd functions of velocity. We derive the\nexpression for total entropy production in such systems using the Fokker-Planck\nequation. The result is consistent with the expression for stochastic entropy\nproduction in the reservoir, that we obtain from probabilities of time-forward\nand time-reversed trajectories, leading to fluctuation theorems. Numerical\nsimulation is used to find probability distribution of entropy production,\nwhich shows good agreement with the detailed fluctuation theorem.\n", "  We consider a wire network of ferromagnetic impurities on the surface of an\n$s$-wave superconductor with strong Rashba spin-orbit interaction. Within the\ntopological phase, zero-energy Majorana fermions appear at wire end-points as\nwell as at junctions between an odd number of wire segments, while no\nlow-energy states are present at junctions between an even number of wire\nsegments, providing strong experimentally accessible signatures for Majorana\nfermions. We also investigate the quasiparticle energy gap with respect to\nvarying the Rashba spin-orbit coupling and magnetic impurity strength.\n", "  We investigate disease spreading on eight empirical data sets of human\ncontacts (mostly proximity networks recording who is close to whom, at what\ntime). We compare three levels of representations of these data sets: temporal\nnetworks, static networks and a fully connected topology. We notice that the\ndifference between the static and fully-connected networks -- with respect to\ntime to extinction and average outbreak size -- is smaller than between the\ntemporal and static topologies. This suggests that, for these data sets,\ntemporal structures influence disease spreading more than static network\nstructures. To explain the details in the differences between the\nrepresentations, we use 32 network measures. This study concur that long-time\ntemporal structures, like the turnover of nodes and links, are the most\nimportant for the spreading dynamics.\n", "  Up to hundreds of black hole binaries individually resolvable by eLISA will\ncoalesce in the Advanced LIGO/Virgo band within ten years, allowing for\nmulti-band gravitational wave observations. Binaries formed via dynamical\ninteractions in dense star clusters are expected to have eccentricities\n$e_0\\sim 10^{-3}$-$10^{-1}$ at the frequencies $f_0=10^{-2}$ Hz where eLISA is\nmost sensitive, while binaries formed in the field should have negligible\neccentricity in both frequency bands. We estimate that eLISA should always be\nable to detect a nonzero $e_0$ whenever $e_0\\gtrsim 10^{-2}$; if $e_0\\sim\n10^{-3}$, eLISA should detect nonzero eccentricity for a fraction $\\sim 90\\%$\n($\\sim 25\\%$) of binaries when the observation time is $T_{\\rm obs}=5$ ($2$)\nyears, respectively. Therefore eLISA observations of BH binaries have the\npotential to distinguish between field and cluster formation scenarios.\n", "  We consider Yang-Mills theory with $N=2$ super translation group in $d=10$\nauxiliary dimensions as the structure group. The gauge theory is defined on a\ndirect product manifold $\\Sigma_2\\times H^2$, where $\\Sigma_2$ is a\ntwo-dimensional Lorentzian manifold and $H^2$ is the open disc in\n$\\mathbb{R}^2$ with the boundary $S^1=\\partial H^2$. We show that in the\nadiabatic limit, when the metric on $H^2$ is scaled down, the Yang-Mills action\nsupplemented by the $d=5$ Chern-Simons term becomes the Green-Schwarz\nsuperstring action. More concretely, the Yang-Mills action in the infrared\nlimit flows to the kinetic part of the superstring action and the $d=5$\nChern-Simons action, defined on a 5-manifold with the boundary $\\Sigma_2\\times\nH^2$, flows to the Wess-Zumino part of the superstring action. The same kind of\nduality between gauge fields and strings is established for type IIB\nsuperstring on AdS$_5\\times S^5$ background and a supergroup gauge theory with\nPSU(2,2$|$4) as the structure group.\n", "  With the Planck 2015 Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) temperature and\npolarization data, we search for possible features in the primordial power\nspectrum (PPS). We revisit the Wiggly Whipped Inflation (WWI) framework and\ndemonstrate how generation of some particular primordial features can improve\nthe fit to Planck data. WWI potential allows the scalar field to transit from a\nsteeper potential to a nearly flat potential through a discontinuity either in\npotential or in its derivatives. WWI offers the inflaton potential\nparametrizations that generate a wide variety of features in the primordial\npower spectra incorporating most of the localized and non-local inflationary\nfeatures that are obtained upon reconstruction from temperature and\npolarization angular power spectrum. At the same time, in a single framework it\nallows us to have a background parameter estimation with a nearly free-form\nprimordial spectrum. Using Planck 2015 data, we constrain the primordial\nfeatures in the context of Wiggly Whipped Inflation and present the features\nthat are supported both by temperature and polarization. WWI model provides\nmore than $13$ improvement in $\\chi^2$ fit to the data with respect to the best\nfit power law model considering combined temperature and polarization data from\nPlanck and B-mode polarization data from BICEP and Planck dust map. We use 2-4\nextra parameters in the WWI model compared to the featureless strict slow roll\ninflaton potential. We find that the differences between the temperature and\npolarization data in constraining background cosmological parameters such as\nbaryon density, cold dark matter density are reduced to a good extent if we use\nprimordial power spectra from WWI. We also discuss the extent of bispectra\nobtained from the best potentials in arbitrary triangular configurations using\nthe BI-spectra and Non-Gaussianity Operator (BINGO).\n", "  We investigate the conditions for the emergence of wave instabilities in a\nvacuum cavity delimited by cylindrical metallic walls under rotation. It is\nshown that for a small vacuum gap and for an angular velocity exceeding a\ncertain threshold, the interactions between the surface plasmon polaritons\nsupported by each wall give rise to an unstable behavior of the electromagnetic\nfield manifested in an exponential growth with time. The instabilities occur\nonly for certain modes of oscillation and are due to the transformation of\nkinetic energy into electromagnetic energy. We also study the possibility of\nhaving asymmetric light flows and optical isolation relying on the relative\nmotion of the cavity walls.\n", "  The conventional approach to circuit quantization is based on node fluxes and\ntraces the motion of node charges on the islands of the circuit. However, for\nsome devices, the relevant physics can be best described by the motion of\npolarization charges over the branches of the circuit that are in general\nrelated to the node charges in a highly nonlocal way. Here, we present a\nmethod, dual to the conventional approach, for quantizing planar circuits in\nterms of loop charges. In this way, the polarization charges are directly\nobtained as the differences of the two loop charges on the neighboring loops.\nThe loop charges trace the motion of fluxes through the circuit loops. We show\nthat loop charges yield a simple description of the flux transport across\nphase-slip junctions. We outline a concrete construction of circuits based on\nphase-slip junctions that are electromagnetically dual to arbitrary planar\nJosephson junction circuits. We argue that loop charges also yield a simple\ndescription of the flux transport in conventional Josephson junctions shunted\nby large impedances. We show that a mixed circuit description in terms of node\nfluxes and loop charges yields an insight into the flux decompactification of a\nJosephson junction shunted by an inductor. As an application, we show that the\nfluxonium qubit is well approximated as a phase-slip junction for the\nexperimentally relevant parameters. Moreover, we argue that the $0$-$\\pi$ qubit\nis effectively the dual of a Majorana Josephson junction.\n", "  We used ab initio random structure searching (AIRSS) to investigate\npolymorphism in C3N4 carbon nitride as a function of pressure. Our calculations\nreveal new framework structures, including a particularly stable chiral\npolymorph of space group P43212 containing mixed sp2 and sp3-bonding, that we\nhave produced experimentally and recovered to ambient conditions. As pressure\nis increased a sequence of structures with fully sp3-bonded C atoms and\nthree-fold coordinated N atoms is predicted, culminating in a dense Pnma phase\nabove 250 GPa. Beyond 650 GPa we find that C3N4 becomes unstable to\ndecomposition into diamond and pyrite-structured CN2.\n", "  We propose a general scheme to probe the compatibility of arbitrary pairing\nstates with a given normal state Hamiltonian by the introduction of a concept\ncalled superconducting fitness. This new quantity gives a direct measure of the\nsuppression of the superconducting critical temperature in presence of key\nsymmetry breaking fields. A merit of the superconducting fitness is that it can\nbe used as a tool to identify non-trivial mechanisms to suppress\nsuperconductivity under various external influences, in particular, magnetic\nfields or distortions, even in complex multi-orbital systems. In the light of\nthis new concept we analyse the multi-band superconductor Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ and\npropose a new mechanism for the suppression of superconductivity in\nmulti-orbital systems, which we call inter-orbital effect, as a possible\nexplanation for the unusual limiting feature observed in the upper critical\nfield of this material.\n", "  To unambiguously diagnose the detailed physical mechanisms and the\nevolutionary status of high-mass star-forming regions (HMSFRs), we have\nperformed 0.4\" ($\\sim1000$ AU) resolution observations towards NGC7538S and\nIRS1, using the Plateau de Bure Interferometer (PdBI). This paper presents a\njoint analysis of the 1.37 mm continuum emission and the line intensity of 15\nmolecular species. Assuming local thermal equilibrium, we derived molecular\ncolumn densities and molecular abundances for each internal gas substructure\nwhich is spatially resolved. These derived quantities are compared with a suite\nof 1-D gas-grain models.\n  NGC7538S is resolved into at least three dense gas condensations. Despite the\ncomparable continuum intensity of these condensations, their differing\nmolecular line emission is suggestive of an overall chemical evolutionary trend\nfrom the northeast to the southeast. Since these condensations are embedded\nwithin the same parent gas core, their differing chemical properties are the\nmost likely due to the different warm-up histories, rather than the different\ndynamic timescales. Despite remaining spatially unresolved, in IRS1 we detect\nabundant complex organic molecules, indicating that IRS1 is the most chemically\nevolved hot molecular core presented here. We observe a continuum that is\ndominated by absorption features with at least three strong emission lines,\npotentially from $\\rm CH_3OH$. The $\\rm CH_3OH$ lines which are purely in\nemission have higher excitation than the ones showing purely absorption.\nPotential reasons for that difference are discussed.\n  This is the first comprehensive comparison of observations of the high-mass\ncores NGC7538S and IRS1 and a chemical model. We have found that different\nchemical evolutionary stages can coexist in the same natal gas core. Our\nachievement illustrates the strength of chemical analysis for understanding\nHMSFRs.\n", "  The fission processes of thermal excited nuclei are conventionally studied by\nstatistical models which rely on inputs of phenomenological level densities and\npotential barriers. Therefore the microscopic descriptions of spontaneous\nfission and induced fission are very desirable for a unified understanding of\nvarious fission processes.\n  We propose to study the fission rates, at both low and high temperatures,\nwith microscopically calculated temperature-dependent fission barriers and\ncollective mass parameters.\n  The fission barriers are calculated by the finite-temperature\nSkyrme-Hartree-Fock+BCS method. The mass parameters are calculated by the\ntemperature-dependent cranking approximation. The thermal fission rates can be\nobtained by the imaginary free energy approach at all temperatures, in which\nfission barriers are naturally temperature dependent. The fission at low\ntemperatures can be described mainly as a barrier-tunneling process. While the\nfission at high temperatures has to incorporate the reflection above barriers.\nOur results of spontaneous fission rates reasonably agree with other studies\nand experiments. The temperature dependencies of fission barrier heights and\ncurvatures have been discussed. The temperature dependent behaviors of mass\nparameters have also been discussed. The thermal fission rates from low to high\ntemperatures with a smooth connection have been given by different approaches.\n\\item[Conclusions] Since the temperature dependencies of fission barrier\nheights and curvatures, and the mass parameters can vary rapidly for different\nnuclei, the microscopic descriptions of thermal fission rates are very\nvaluable. Our studies without free parameters provide a consistent picture to\nstudy various fissions such as that in fast-neutron reactors, astrophysical\nenvironments and fusion reactions for superheavy nuclei.\n", "  We study the conjectured \"Insensitivity to Chiral Symmetry Breaking\" in the\nhighly excited light baryon spectrum. While the experimental spectrum is being\nmeasured at JLab and CBELSA/TAPS, this insensitivity remains to be computed\ntheoretically in detail. As the only existing option to have both confinement,\nhighly excited states and chiral symmetry, we adopt the truncated Coulomb gauge\nformulation of QCD, considering a linearly confining Coulomb term. Adopting a\nsystematic and numerically intensive variational treatment up to 12 harmonic\noscillator shells we are able to access several angular and radial excitations.\nWe compute both the excited spectra of $I=1/2$ and $I=3/2$ baryons, up to large\nspin $J=13/2$, and study in detail the proposed chiral multiplets. While the\nstatic-light and light-light spectra clearly show chiral symmetry restoration\nhigh in the spectrum, the realization of chiral symmetry is more complicated in\nthe baryon spectrum than earlier expected.\n", "  We propose an explanation of the galactic center gamma ray excess by\nsupersymmetric WIMPs as heavy as 500 GeV. The lightest neutralino annihilates\ninto vector-like leptons or quarks which cascade decay through intermediate\nHiggs bosons. Due to the long decay chains, the gamma ray spectrum is much\nsofter than naively expected and peaks at GeV energies. The model predicts\ncorrelated diboson and dijet signatures to be tested at the LHC.\n", "  Periodically driven systems provide tunable platforms to realize interesting\nFloquet topological phases and phase transitions. In electronic systems with\nWeyl dispersions, the band crossings are topologically protected even in the\npresence of time-periodic perturbations. This robustness permits various routes\nto shift and tilt the Weyl spectra in the momentum and energy space using\ncircularly polarized light of sufficient intensity. We show that type-II Weyl\nfermions, in which the Weyl dispersions are tilted with the appearance of\npocket-like Fermi surfaces, can be induced in driven Dirac semimetals and line\nnode semimetals. Under a circularly polarized drive, both semimemtal systems\nimmediately generate Weyl node pairs whose types can be further controlled by\nthe driving amplitude and direction. The resultant phase diagrams demonstrate\nexperimental feasibilities.\n", "  For arbitrary space dimension $d$ we investigate the quantum phase\ntransitions of two paradigmatic spin models defined on a hypercubic lattice,\nthe coupled-dimer Heisenberg model and the transverse-field Ising model. To\nthis end high-order linked-cluster expansions for the ground-state energy and\nthe one-particle gap are performed up to order 9 about the decoupled-dimer and\nhigh-field limits, respectively. Extrapolations of the high-order series yield\nthe location of the quantum phase transition and the correlation-length\nexponent $\\nu$ as a function of space dimension $d$. The results are\ncomplemented by $1/d$ expansions to next-to-leading order of observables across\nthe phase diagrams. Remarkably, our analysis of the extrapolated linked-cluster\nexpansion allows to extract the coefficients of the full $1/d$ expansion for\nthe phase-boundary location in both models exactly in leading order and\nquantitatively for subleading corrections.\n", "  Aims. We investigate the spatial distribution of a collection of absorbing\ngas clouds, some associated with the dense, massive star-forming core NGC6334\nI, and others with diffuse foreground clouds. For the former category, we aim\nto study the dynamical properties of the clouds in order to assess their\npotential to feed the accreting protostellar cores.\n  Methods. We use spectral imaging from the Herschel SPIRE iFTS to construct a\nmap of HF absorption at 243 micron in a 6x3.5 arcmin region surrounding NGC6334\nI and I(N).\n  Results. The combination of new, spatially fully sampled, but spectrally\nunresolved mapping with a previous, single-pointing, spectrally resolved HF\nsignature yields a 3D picture of absorbing gas clouds in the direction of\nNGC6334. Toward core I, the HF equivalent width matches that of the spectrally\nresolved observation. The distribution of HF absorption is consistent with\nthree of the seven components being associated with this dense star-forming\nenvelope. For two of the remaining four components, our data suggest that these\nclouds are spatially associated with the larger scale filamentary star-forming\ncomplex. Our data also implies a lack of gas phase HF in the envelope of core\nI(N). Using a simple description of adsorption onto and desorption from dust\ngrain surfaces, we show that the overall lower temperature of the envelope of\nsource I(N) is consistent with freeze-out of HF, while it remains in the gas\nphase in source I.\n  Conclusions. We use the HF molecule as a tracer of column density in diffuse\ngas (n(H) ~ 10^2 - 10^3 cm^-3), and find that it may uniquely trace a\nrelatively low density portion of the gas reservoir available for star\nformation that otherwise escapes detection. At higher densities prevailing in\nprotostellar envelopes (>10^4 cm^-3), we find evidence of HF depletion from the\ngas phase under sufficiently cold conditions.\n", "  The observation of hydrogen-like $\\pi K$ atoms, consisting of $\\pi^- K^+$ or\n$\\pi^+ K^-$ mesons, is presented. The atoms have been produced by 24 GeV/$c$\nprotons from the CERN PS accelerator, interacting with platinum or nickel foil\ntargets. The breakup (ionisation) of $\\pi K$ atoms in the same targets yields\ncharacteristic $\\pi K$ pairs, called \"atomic pairs\", with small relative\nmomenta in the pair centre-of-mass system. The upgraded DIRAC experiment has\nobserved $349\\pm62$ such atomic $\\pi K$ pairs, corresponding to a signal of 5.6\nstandard deviations.\n", "  Dimer models have long been a fruitful playground for understanding\ntopological physics. Here we introduce a new class - termed Majorana-dimer\nmodels - wherein bosonic dimers are decorated with pairs of Majorana modes. We\nfind that the simplest examples of such systems realize an intriguing,\nintrinsically fermionic phase of matter that can be viewed as the product of a\nchiral Ising theory, which hosts deconfined non-Abelian quasiparticles, and a\ntopological $p_x - ip_y$ superconductor. While the bulk anyons are described by\na single copy of the Ising theory, the edge remains fully gapped. Consequently,\nthis phase can arise in exactly solvable, frustration-free models. We describe\ntwo parent Hamiltonians: one generalizes the well-known dimer model on the\ntriangular lattice, while the other is most naturally understood as a model of\ndecorated fluctuating loops on a honeycomb lattice. Using modular\ntransformations, we show that the ground-state manifold of the latter model\nunambiguously exhibits all properties of the $\\text{Ising} \\times (p_x-ip_y)$\ntheory. We also discuss generalizations with more than one Majorana mode per\nsite, which realize phases related to Kitaev's 16-fold way in a similar\nfashion.\n", "  Two-particle intensity correlation between the proton ($p$) and the\nOmega-baryon ($\\Omega$) in high-energy heavy ion collisions is studied to\nunravel the possible spin-2 $p\\Omega$ dibaryon recently suggested by lattice\nQCD simulations. The ratio of correlation functions between small and large\ncollision systems, $C_{\\rm SL}(Q)$, is proposed to be a new measure to extract\nthe strong $p\\Omega$ interaction without much contamination from the Coulomb\nattraction. Relevance of this quantity to the experimental observables in\nheavy-ion collisions is also discussed.\n", "  One of the most important goals of condensed matter physics is materials by\ndesign, i.e. the ability to reliably predict and design materials with a set of\ndesired properties. A striking example is the deterministic enhancement of the\nsuperconducting properties of materials. Recent experiments have demonstrated\nthat the metamaterial approach is capable of achieving this goal, such as\ntripling the critical temperature Tc in Al-Al2O3 epsilon near zero (ENZ)\ncore-shell metamaterial superconductors. However, transport properties of such\nmetamaterials remained much worse compared to conventional superconductors.\nHere, we demonstrate that an Al/Al2O3 hyperbolic metamaterial geometry is\ncapable of a similar Tc enhancement, while having superior transport and\nmagnetic properties compared to the core-shell metamaterial superconductors.\nThis result opens up numerous new possibilities for metamaterial enhancement of\nTc in other practically important simple superconductors, such as niobium and\nMgB2. It also indicates that the recently discovered hyperbolic properties of\nhigh Tc superconductors may play considerable role in superconductivity\nenhancement in cuprates.\n", "  The theory of non-expanding horizons (NEH) geometry and the theory of near\nhorizon geometries (NHG) are two mathematical relativity frameworks\ngeneralizing the black hole theory. From the point of view of the NEHs theory,\na NHG is just a very special case of a spacetime containing an NEH of many\nextra symmetries. It can be obtained as the Horowitz limit of a neighborhood of\nan arbitrary extremal Killing horizon. An unexpected relation between the two\nof them, was discovered in the study of spacetimes foliated by a family of\nNEHs. The class of 4-dimensional NHG solutions (either vacuum or coupled to a\nMaxwell field) was found as a family of examples of spacetimes admitting a NEH\nfoliation. In the current paper we systematically investigate geometries of the\nNEHs foliating a spacetime for arbitrary matter content and in arbitrary\nspacetime dimension. We find that each horizon belonging to the foliation\nsatisfies a condition that may be interpreted as an invitation for a\ntransversal extremal Killing horizon to exist. Assuming the existence of a\ntransversal extremal Killing horizon, we derive all the spacetime metrics\nsatisfying the vacuum Einstein's equations.\n", "  Supermassive black holes (SMBH) are essential for the production of jets in\nradio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGN). Theoretical models based on Blandford\n& Znajek extract the rotational energy from a Kerr black hole, which could be\nthe case for NGC1052, to launch these jets. This requires magnetic fields of\nthe order of $10^3\\,$G to $10^4\\,$G. We imaged the vicinity of the SMBH of the\nAGN NGC1052 with the Global Millimetre VLBI Array and found a bright and\ncompact central feature, smaller than 1.9 light days (100 Schwarzschild radii)\nin radius. Interpreting this as a blend of the unresolved jet bases, we derive\nthe magnetic field at 1 Schwarzschild radius to lie between 200 G and ~80000 G\nconsistent with Blandford & Znajek models.\n", "  Based on the explicit knowledge of a Hamiltonian of mean force, the classical\nstatistical mechanics and equilibrium thermodynamics of open systems in contact\nwith a thermal environment at arbitrary interaction strength can be formulated.\nEven though the Hamiltonian of mean force uniquely determines the equilibrium\nphase space probability density of a strongly coupled open system the knowledge\nof this probability density alone is insufficient to determine the Hamiltonian\nof mean force, needed in constructing the underlying statistical mechanics and\nthermodynamics. We demonstrate that under the assumption that the Hamiltonian\nof mean force is known, an extension of thermodynamic structures from the level\nof averaged quantities to fluctuating objects (i.e. a stochastic\nthermodynamics) is possible. However, such a construction undesirably involves\nalso a vast ambiguity. This situation is rooted in the eminent lack of a\nphysical guiding principle allowing to distinguish a physically meaningful\ntheory out of a multitude of other equally conceivable ones.\n", "  We study the compatibility (or joint measurability) of quantum observables in\na setting where the experimenter has access to multiple copies of a given\nquantum system, rather than performing the experiments on each individual copy\nseparately. We introduce the index of incompatibility as a quantifier of\nincompatibility in this multi-copy setting, as well as the notion of\ncompatibility stack representing the various compatibility relations present in\na given set of observables. We then prove a general structure theorem for\nmulti-copy joint observables, and use it to prove that all abstract\ncompatibility stacks with three vertices have realizations in terms of quantum\nobservables.\n", "  We propose a formalism for the analysis of direct-detection dark-matter\nsearches that covers all coherent responses for scalar and vector interactions\nand incorporates QCD constraints imposed by chiral symmetry, including all one-\nand two-body WIMP-nucleon interactions up to third order in chiral effective\nfield theory. One of the free parameters in the WIMP-nucleus cross section\ncorresponds to standard spin-independent searches, but in general different\ncombinations of new-physics couplings are probed. We identify the interference\nwith the isovector counterpart of the standard spin-independent response and\ntwo-body currents as the dominant corrections to the leading spin-independent\nstructure factor, and discuss the general consequences for the interpretation\nof direct-detection experiments, including minimal extensions of the standard\nspin-independent analysis. Fits for all structure factors required for the\nscattering off xenon targets are provided based on state-of-the-art nuclear\nshell-model calculations.\n", "  We propose and demonstrate a method for quantum-state tomography of qudits\nencoded in the quantum polarization of $N$-photon states. This is achieved by\ndistributing $N$ photons nondeterministically into three paths and their\nsubsequent projection, which for $N=1$ is equivalent to measuring the Stokes\n(or Pauli) operators. The statistics of the recorded $N$-fold coincidences\ndetermines the unknown $N$-photon polarization state uniquely. The proposed,\nfixed setup manifestly rules out any systematic measurement errors due to\nmoving components and allows for simple switching between tomography of\ndifferent states, which makes it ideal for adaptive tomography schemes.\n", "  We present an analysis of data on single inclusive pion production measured\nby the LHCf collaboration in high-energy proton-proton and proton-nucleus at\nultra-forward rapidities, $8.8 \\leq\\! y\\leq \\!10.8$. We also analyse forward\nRHIC data for calibration purposes. Our analysis relies on the use of a Monte\nCarlo event generator that combines a perturbative description of the\nelementary scattering process at partonic level based on the hybrid formalism\nof the Color Glass Condensate with an implementation of hadronization in the\nframework of the Lund string fragmentation model. This procedure allows us to\nreach values of the momenta of the produced particles as low as detected\nexperimentally $p_t\\sim0.1$ GeV. We achieve a good description of single\ninclusive spectra of charged particles and neutral pions at RHIC and the LHC\nrespectively, and nuclear modification factors for proton-lead collisions at\nthe LHC. Our results add evidence to the idea that particle production in the\ndomain of very small Bjorken-$x$ is dominated by the saturation effects encoded\nin the unintegrated gluon distribution of the target. Being forward particle\nproduction of key importance in the development of air showers, we stress that\nthis approach allows for a theoretically controlled extrapolation of our\nresults to the scale of ultra-high energy cosmic rays, thus serving as starting\npoint for future works on this topic.\n", "  Non-Abelian vortex strings supported in a certain four-dimensional N=2\nYang-Mills theory with fundamental matter were shown arXiv:1502.00683 to become\ncritical superstrings. In addition to translational moduli non-Abelian string\nunder consideration carries orientational and size moduli. Their dynamics is\ndescribed by two-dimensional sigma model whose target space is a tautological\nbundle over the complex projective space. For the N=2 theory with the $U(2)$\ngauge group and four fundamental hypermultiplets there are six orientational\nand size moduli. After combining with four translational moduli they form a\nten-dimensional target space required for a superstring to be critical. For the\ntheory in question the target space of the sigma model is C^2 x Y_6, where Y_6\nis a conifold. We study closed string states which emerge in four dimensions\n(4D) and identify them with hadrons of the 4D bulk N=2 theory. It turns out\nthat most of the states arising from the ten-dimensional graviton spectrum are\nnon-dynamical in 4D. We find a single dynamical massless hypermultiplet\nassociated with the deformation of the complex structure of the conifold. We\ninterpret this degree of freedom as a monopole-monopole baryon of the 4D theory\n(at strong coupling).\n", "  We theoretically investigate nonlinear ballistic thermoelectric transport in\na superlattice-structured nanowire. By a special choice of nonuniform widths of\nthe superlattice barriers - analogous to anti-reflection coating in optical\nsystems - it is possible to achieve a transmission which comes close to a\nsquare profile as a function of energy. We calculate the low-temperature output\npower and power-conversion efficiency of a thermoelectric generator based on\nsuch a structure and show that the efficiency remains high also when operating\nat a significant power. To provide guidelines for experiments, we study how the\nresults depend on the nanowire radius, the number of barriers, and on random\nimperfections in barrier width and separation. Our results indicate that high\nefficiencies can indeed be achieved with todays capabilities in epitaxial\nnanowire growth.\n", "  Density-functional calculations are used to identify one-atom-thick metallic\nIn overlayers on the Si(111) surface, which have long been sought in quest of\nthe ultimate two-dimensional (2D) limit of free-electron-like metallic\nproperties. We predict two metastable single-layer In phases, one\n$\\sqrt{7}\\times\\sqrt{3}$ phase with a coverage of 1.4 monolayer (ML; here 1 ML\nrefers to one In atom per top Si atom) and the other $\\sqrt{7}\\times\\sqrt{7}$\nphase with 1.43 ML, which indeed match well with experimental evidences. Both\nphases reveal quasi-1D arrangements of protruded In atoms, leading to\n2D-metallic but anisotropic band structures and Fermi surfaces. This\ndirectional feature contrasts with the free-electron-like In-overlayer\nproperties that are known to persist up to the double-layer thickness, implying\nthat we may have achieved the 2D limit of free-electron-like In overlayers in\nprevious studies of double-layer In phases.\n", "  A minimal extension of the Standard Model that provides both a dark matter\ncandidate and a strong first-order electroweak phase transition (EWPT) consists\nof two additional Lorentz and gauge singlets. In this paper we work out a\ncomposite Higgs version of this scenario, based on the coset $SO(7)/SO(6)$. We\nshow that by embedding the elementary fermions in appropriate representations\nof $SO(7)$, all dominant interactions are described by only three free\neffective parameters. Within the model dependencies of the embedding, the\ntheory predicts one of the singlets to be stable and responsible for the\nobserved dark matter abundance. At the same time, the second singlet introduces\nnew $CP$-violation phases and triggers a strong first-order EWPT, making\nelectroweak baryogenesis feasible. It turns out that this scenario does not\nconflict with current observations and it is promising for solving the dark\nmatter and baryon asymmetry puzzles. The tight predictions of the model will be\naccessible at the forthcoming dark matter direct detection and gravitational\nwave experiments.\n", "  The fluids and polymers have different fundamental symmetries. Namely, the\nLagrangian relabeling symmetry of fluids is absent for polymers (while the\ntranslational and rotational symmetries are still present). This fact results\nin spontaneous breaking of the relabeling symmetry in fluid turbulence even at\na tiny polymer addition. Since helicity conservation in inviscid fluid motions\nis a consequence of the relabeling symmetry (due to the Noether's theorem)\nviolation of this conservation by the polymer additives results in the strong\neffects in the distributed chaos. The distributed chaos in turbulence with the\nspontaneously broken relabeling symmetry is characterized by stretched\nexponential spectra $\\propto \\exp(-k/k_{\\beta})^{\\beta}$ with $\\beta =2/5$. The\nspectral range of this distributed chaos is extended in direction of the small\nwavenumbers and $k_{\\beta}$ becomes much larger in comparison with the pure\nfluid (Newtonian) case. This results in substantial suppression of small-scale\nturbulence and large-scale mixing enhancement. Good agreement with results of\ndirect numerical simulations (DNS) and experimental data has been established\nfor a channel flow (DNS), for Rayleigh-Taylor turbulent convection (DNS) and\nfor Rayleigh-Benard turbulent convection (experiment).\n", "  Recently it was shown that the quantum behavior of an intense cavity field\ncan be revealed by measuring the steady atomic correlations between two ideal\natoms, which interact with the same leaking cavity mode. Considering a weak\natom-field coupling regime and large average number of photons in the cavity\nmode ($\\bar{n}$), one expects that a semiclassical theory could explain the\nwhole dynamics of the system. However, this system presents the generation of\ncorrelations between the atoms, which is a signature of the quantumness of the\ncavity field even in the limit of $\\bar{n} \\gg 1$ [Phys. Rev. Lett.\n\\textbf{107}, 153601 (2011)]. Here, we extend this result by investigating the\nrelaxation time for such a system. We have shown that the relaxation time of\nthe system varies proportionally to $\\bar{n}$ for a coherent driving, but it is\ninversely proportional to $\\bar{n}$ for an incoherent pumping. Thus, the time\nrequired to observe the manifestation of the quantum aspects of a cavity field\non the atomic correlations diverges as $\\bar{n}$ tends to macroscopic values\ndue to a coherent driving, while it goes to zero for incoherent pumping. For a\ncoherent driving, we can also see that this system presents metastability,\ni.e., firstly the atomic system reaches a quasi-stationary state which last for\na long time interval, but eventually it reaches the real steady state. We have\nalso discussed the effects of small atomic decay. In this case, the steady\ncorrelations between the atoms disappear for long times, but the intense cavity\nfield is still able to generate atomic correlations at intermediate times.\nThen, considering a real scenario, we would be able to monitor the quantumness\nof a cavity field in a certain time interval.\n", "  Causal Dynamical Triangulations (CDT) is a non-perturbative quantisation of\ngeneral relativity. Ho\\v{r}ava-Lifshitz gravity on the other hand modifies\ngeneral relativity to allow for perturbative quan- tisation. Past work has\ngiven rise to the speculation that Ho\\v{r}ava-Lifshitz gravity might correspond\nto the continuum limit of CDT. In this paper we add another piece to this\npuzzle by applying the CDT quantisation prescription directly to\nHo\\v{r}ava-Lifshitz gravity in 2 dimensions. We derive the continuum\nHamiltonian and we show that it matches exactly the Hamiltonian one derives\nfrom canonically quantising the Ho\\v{r}ava-Lifshitz action. Unlike the standard\nCDT case, here the intro- duction of a foliated lattice does not impose further\nrestriction on the configuration space and, as a result, lattice quantisation\ndoes not leave any imprint on continuum physics as expected.\n", "  The exact exponential Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation operator applicable for\na particle with an arbitrary spin is derived. It can be successfully utilized\nfor verifying any Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation method based on the\nexponential operator. When a verified method is relativistic, the relativistic\nexponential operator should be expanded in the semirelativistic power series.\nThe use of the obtained exponential operator for a derivation of the\nFoldy-Wouthuysen Hamiltonian makes it possible to check the validity of any\nother method of the Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation, while this possibility may\nneed a greater computational effort.\n", "  The light curve of many supernovae (SNe) and gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) can be\nexplained by a sustained injection of extra energy from its possible central\nengine, a rapidly rotating strongly magnetic neutron star (i.e. magnetar). The\nmagnetic dipole radiation power that the magnetar supplies comes at the expense\nof the star's rotational energy. However, radiation by gravitational waves\n(GWs) can be more efficient than magnetic dipole radiation because of its\nstronger dependence on neutron star spin rate Omega, i.e. Omega^6 (for a static\n'mountain') or Omega^8 (for a r-mode fluid oscillation) versus Omega^4 for\nmagnetic dipole radiation. Here, we use the magnetic field B and initial spin\nperiod P_0 inferred from SN and GRB observations to obtain simple constraints\non the dimensionless amplitude of the mountain of epsilon < 0.01 and r-mode\noscillation of alpha < 1, the former being similar to that obtained by recent\nworks. We then include GW emission within the magnetar model. We show that when\nepsilon > 10^-4 (B/10^14 G) (P_0/1 ms) or alpha > 0.01 (B/10^14 G) (P_0/1\nms)^2, light curves are strongly affected, with significant decrease in peak\nluminosity and increase in time to peak luminosity. Thus the GW effects studied\nhere are more pronounced for low B and short P_0 but are unlikely to be\nimportant in modelling SN and GRB light curves since the amplitudes needed for\nnoticeable changes are quite large.\n", "  We consider quantum field theoretic systems subject to a time-dependent\nperturbation, and discuss the question of defining a time dependent particle\nnumber not just at asymptotic early and late times, but also during the\nperturbation. Naively, this is not a well-defined notion for such a\nnon-equilibrium process, as the particle number at intermediate times depends\non a basis choice of reference states with respect to which particles and\nanti-particles are defined, even though the final late-time particle number is\nindependent of this basis choice. The basis choice is associated with a\nparticular truncation of the adiabatic expansion. The adiabatic expansion is\ndivergent, and we show that if this divergent expansion is truncated at its\noptimal order, a universal time dependence is obtained, confirming a general\nresult of Dingle and Berry. This optimally truncated particle number provides a\nclear picture of quantum interference effects for perturbations with\nnon-trivial temporal sub-structure. We illustrate these results using several\nequivalent definitions of adiabatic particle number: the Bogoliubov, Riccati,\nSpectral Function and Schrodinger picture approaches. In each approach, the\nparticle number may be expressed in terms of the tiny deviations between the\nexact and adiabatic solutions of the Ermakov-Milne equation for the associated\ntime-dependent oscillators.\n", "  The bicollinear antiferromagnetic order experimentally observed in FeTe is\nshown to be stabilized by the coupling $\\tilde g_{12}$ between monoclinic\nlattice distortions and the spin-nematic order parameter with $B_{\\rm 2g}$\nsymmetry, within a three-orbital spin-fermion model studied with Monte Carlo\ntechniques. A finite but small value of $\\tilde g_{12}$ is required, with a\nconcomitant lattice distortion compatible with experiments, and a\ntetragonal-monoclinic transition strongly first order. Remarkably, the\nbicollinear state found here displays a planar resistivity with the \"reversed\"\npuzzling anisotropy discovered in transport experiments.Orthorhombic\ndistortions are also incorporated and phase diagrams interpolating between\npnictides and chalcogenides are presented. We conclude that the spin-lattice\ncoupling discussed here is sufficient to explain the challenging properties of\nFeTe.\n", "  Ultracold bosonic atoms in optical lattices self-organize into a variety of\nstructural and quantum phases when placed into a single-mode cavity and pumped\nby a laser. Cavity optomechanical effects induce an atom density modulation at\nthe cavity-mode wave length that competes with the optical lattice arrangement.\nSimultaneously short-range interactions via particle hopping promote superfluid\norder, such that a variety of structural and quantum coherent phases can occur.\nWe analyze the emerging phase diagram in two dimensions by means of an extended\nBose-Hubbard model using a local mean field approach combined with a superfluid\ncluster analysis. For commensurate ratios of the cavity and external lattice\nwave lengths the Mott insulator-superfluid transition is modified by the\nappearance of charge density wave and supersolid phases, at which the atomic\ndensity supports the buildup of a cavity field. For incommensurate ratios, the\noptomechanical forces induce the formation of Bose-glass and superglass phases,\nnamely non-superfluid and superfluid phases, respectively, displaying\nquasi-periodic density modulations, which in addition can exhibit structural\nand superfluid stripe formation. The onset of such structures is constrained by\nthe onsite interaction and is favourable at fractional densities. Experimental\nobservables are identified and discussed.\n", "  Neither HI nor CO emission can reveal a significant quantity of so-called\ndark gas in the interstellar medium (ISM). It is considered that CO-dark\nmolecular gas (DMG), the molecular gas with no or weak CO emission, dominates\ndark gas. We identified 36 DMG clouds with C$^+$ emission (data from Galactic\nObservations of Terahertz C+ (GOT C+) project) and HINSA features. Based on\nuncertainty analysis, optical depth of HI $\\tau\\rm_{HI}$ of 1 is a reasonable\nvalue for most clouds. With the assumption of $\\tau\\rm_{HI}=1$, these clouds\nwere characterized by excitation temperatures in a range of 20 K to 92 K with a\nmedian value of 55 K and volume densities in the range of $6.2\\times10^1$\ncm$^{-3}$ to $1.2\\times 10^3$ cm$^{-3}$ with a median value of $2.3\\times 10^2$\ncm$^{-3}$. The fraction of DMG column density in the cloud ($f\\rm_{DMG}$)\ndecreases with increasing excitation temperature following an empirical\nrelation $f\\rm_{DMG}=-2.1\\times 10^{-3}T_(ex,\\tau_{HI}=1)$+1.0. The relation\nbetween $f\\rm_{DMG}$ and total hydrogen column density $N_H$ is given by\n$f\\rm_{DMG}$=$1.0-3.7\\times 10^{20}/N_H$. The values of $f\\rm_{DMG}$ in the\nclouds of low extinction group ($A\\rm_V \\le 2.7$ mag) are consistent with the\nresults of the time-dependent, chemical evolutionary model at the age of ~ 10\nMyr. Our empirical relation cannot be explained by the chemical evolutionary\nmodel for clouds in the high extinction group ($A\\rm_V > 2.7$ mag). Compared to\nclouds in the low extinction group ($A\\rm_V \\le 2.7$ mag), clouds in the high\nextinction group ($A\\rm_V > 2.7$ mag) have comparable volume densities but\nexcitation temperatures that are 1.5 times lower. Moreover, CO abundances in\nclouds of the high extinction group ($A\\rm_V > 2.7$ mag) are $6.6\\times 10^2$\ntimes smaller than the canonical value in the Milky Way. #[Full version of\nabstract is shown in the text.]#\n", "  Shape Dynamics is a 3D conformally invariant theory of gravity which\npossesses a large set of solutions in common with General Relativity. When\nlooked closely, these solutions are found to behave in surprising ways, so in\norder to probe the fitness of Shape Dynamics as a viable alternative to General\nRelativity one must find and understand increasingly more complex, less\nsymmetrical exact solutions, on which to base perturbative studies and\nnumerical analyses in order to compare them with data. Spherically symmetric\nexact solutions have been studied, but only in a static vacuum setup. In this\nwork we construct a class of time-dependent exact solutions of Shape Dynamics\nfrom first principles, representing a central inhomogeneity in an evolving\ncosmological environment. By assuming only a perfect fluid source in a\nspherically symmetric geometry we show that this fully dynamic non-vacuum\nsolution satisfies in all generality the Hamiltonian structure of Shape\nDynamics. The simplest choice of solutions is shown to be a member of the\nMcVittie family.\n", "  One of the possible sources of hadronic cosmic rays (CRs) are newborn\npulsars. If this is indeed the case, they should feature diffusive gamma-ray\nhalos produced by interactions of CRs with interstellar gas. In this paper we\ntry to identify extended gamma-ray emission around young pulsars, making use of\nthe 7-year Fermi-LAT data. For this purpose we select and analyze a set of\neight pulsars that are most likely to possess detectable gamma-ray halos. We\nfind extended emission that might be interpreted as a gamma-ray halo only in\nthe case of PSR J0007+7303. Its luminosity accords with the total energy of\ninjected cosmic rays $\\sim 10^{50}$ erg, although other interpretations of this\nsource are possible. Irrespectively of the nature of this source we put bounds\non the luminosity of gamma-ray halos which suggest that pulsars' contribution\nto the overall energy budget of galactic CRs is subdominant in the GeV-TeV\nrange.\n", "  We numerically study the effect of the edge states on the conductance and\nthermopower in zigzag phosphorene nanoribbons (ZPNRs) based on the\ntight-binding model and the scattering-matrix method. It is interesting to find\nthat the band dispersion, conductance, and thermopower can be modulated by\napplying a bias voltage and boundary potentials to the two layers of the ZPNRs.\nUnder the certain bias voltage, the two-fold degenerate quasi-flat edge bands\nsplit perfectly. The conductance can be switched off, and the thermopower\naround zero energy increases. In addition, when only the boundary potential of\nthe top layer or bottom layer is adjusted, only one edge band bends and merges\ninto the bulk band. The first conductance plateau is strongly decreased to\n$e^2/h$ around zero energy. Particularly, when the two boundary potentials are\nadjusted, all the edge bands bend and fully merge into the bulk band, and the\nbulk energy gap is maximized. More interestingly, a pronounced conductance\nplateau with $G=0$ is found around zero energy, which is attributable to the\nopening of the bulk energy gap between the valence and conduction bands.\nMeanwhile, the thermopower can be enhanced more than twice, compared to that of\nthe perfect ZPNRs. The large magnitude of thermopower is ascribed to the\nappearance of the bulk energy gap around zero energy. Our results show that the\nmodulated ZPNRs are more reliable in thermoelectric application.\n", "  By analogy with linear-response we formulate the duality and reciprocity\nproperties of current and voltage fluctuations expressed by Nyquist relations\nincluding the intrinsic bandwidths of the respective fluctuations. For this\npurpose we individuate total-number and drift-velocity fluctuations of carriers\ninside a conductor as the microscopic sources of noise. The spectral densities\nat low frequency of the current and voltage fluctuations and the respective\nconductance and resistance are related in a mutual exclusive way to the\ncorresponding noise-source. The macroscopic variance of current and voltage\nfluctuations are found to display a dual property via a plasma conductance that\nadmits a reciprocal plasma resistance. Analogously, the microscopic\nnoise-sources are found to obey a dual property and a reciprocity relation. The\nformulation is carried out in the frame of the grand canonical (for current\nnoise) and canonical (for voltage noise) ensembles and results are derived\nwhich are valid for classical as well as for degenerate statistics including\nfractional exclusion statistics. The unifying theory so developed sheds new\nlight on the microscopic interpretation of dissipation and fluctuation\nphenomena in conductors. In particular it is proven that, as a consequence of\nthe Pauli principle, for Fermions non-vanishing single-carrier velocity\nfluctuations at zero temperature are responsible for diffusion but not for\ncurrent noise, which vanishes in this limit.\n", "  Despite its long standing usefulness for the analysis of various processes in\nintense laser fields, it is well-known that the so-called strong-field KFR or\nSFA ansatz does not account for the final-state Coulomb interaction. Due to its\nimportance for the ubiquitous ionisation process, numerous heuristic attempts\nhave been made during the last several decades to account for the final state\nCoulomb interaction with in the SFA. Also to this end an ad hoc model with the\nso-called Coulomb-Volkov final state was introduced a long time ago. However,\ntill now, no systematic strong-field S-matrix expansion using the\nCoulomb-Volkov final state could be found. Here we solve this long standing\nproblem by determining the Coulomb-Volkov Hamiltonian, identifying the\nrest-interaction in the final state, and explicitly constructng the\nCoulomb-Volkov propagator (or Green's function). We employ them to derive the\ncomplete S-matrix series for the ionisation amplitude governed by the\nCoulomb-Volkov final state in all orders. The results are given in both\n\"velocity\" and \"length\" gauges. We also present a gauge independent version of\nthe Coulomb-Volkov S-matrix series.\n", "  We show that known entropy bounds constrain the information carried off by\nradiation to null infinity. We consider distant, planar null hypersurfaces in\nasymptotically flat spacetime. Their focussing and area loss can be computed\nperturbatively on a Minkowski background, yielding entropy bounds in terms of\nthe energy flux of the outgoing radiation. In the asymptotic limit, we obtain\nboundary versions of the Quantum Null Energy Condition, of the Generalized\nSecond Law, and of the Quantum Bousso Bound.\n", "  We develop methods to calculate the electroweak gauge boson contribution to\nthe effective Higgs potential in the context of composite Higgs models, using\nlattice gauge theory. The calculation is analogous to that of the\nelectromagnetic mass splitting of the pion multiplet in QCD. We discuss\ntechnical details of carrying out this calculation, including modeling of the\nmomentum and fermion-mass dependence of the underlying current-current\ncorrelation function; direct integration of the correlation function over\nmomentum; and fits based on the minimal-hadron approximation. We show results\nof a numerical study using valence overlap fermions, carried out in an SU(4)\ngauge theory with two flavors of Dirac fermions in the two-index antisymmetric\nrepresentation.\n", "  The spin transitions in the fractional quantum Hall effect provide a direct\nmeasure of the tiny energy differences between differently spin-polarized\nstates, and thereby serve as an extremely sensitive test of the quantitative\naccuracy of the theory of the fractional quantum Hall effect, and, in\nparticular, of the role of Landau-level mixing in lifting the particle-hole\nsymmetry. We report on an accurate quantitative study of this physics,\nevaluating the effect of Landau-level mixing in a nonperturbative manner using\na fixed-phase diffusion Monte Carlo method. We find excellent agreement between\nour calculated critical Zeeman energies and the experimentally measured values.\nIn particular, we find, as also do experiments, that the critical Zeeman\nenergies for fractional quantum Hall states at filling factors $\\nu=2-n/(2n\\pm\n1)$ are significantly higher than those for $\\nu=n/(2n\\pm 1)$, a quantitative\nsignature of the lifting of particle-hole symmetry due to Landau-level mixing.\n", "  Point defects in diamond are of high interest as candidates for realizing\nsolid state quantum bits, bioimaging agents, or ultrasensitive electric or\nmagnetic field sensors. Various artificial diamond synthesis methods should\nintroduce oxygen contamination in diamond, however, the incorporation of oxygen\ninto diamond crystal and the nature of oxygen-related point defects are largely\nunknown. Oxygen may be potentially interesting as a source of quantum bits or\nit may interact with other point defects which are well established solid state\nqubits. Here we employ plane-wave supercell calculations within density\nfunctional theory, in order to characterize the electronic and magneto-optical\nproperties of various oxygen-related defects. Beside the trivial single\ninterstitial and substitutional oxygen defects we also consider their complexes\nwith vacancies and hydrogen atoms. We find that oxygen defects are mostly\nelectrically active and introduce highly correlated orbitals that pose a\nchallenge for density functional theory modeling. Nevertheless, we are able to\nidentify the fingerprints of substitutional oxygen defect, the oxygen-vacancy\nand oxygen-vacancy-hydrogen complexes in the electron paramagnetic resonance\nspectrum. We demonstrate that first principles calculations can predict the\nmotional averaging of the electron paramagnetic resonance spectrum of defects\nthat are subject to Jahn-Teller distortion. We show that the high-spin neutral\noxygen-vacancy defect exhibits very fast non-radiative decay from its optical\nexcited state that might hinder to apply it as a qubit.\n", "  We consider how tetraquarks can affect the chiral phase transition in\ntheories like QCD, with light quarks coupled to three colors. For two flavors\nthe tetraquark field is an isosinglet, and its effect is minimal. For three\nflavors, however, the tetraquark field transforms in the same representation of\nthe chiral symmetry group as the usual chiral order parameter, and so for very\nlight quarks there may be two chiral phase transitions, which are both of first\norder. In QCD, results from the lattice indicate that any transition from the\ntetraquark condensate is a smooth crossover. In the plane of temperature and\nquark chemical potential, though, a crossover line for the tetraquark\ncondensate is naturally related to the transition line for color\nsuperconductivity. For four flavors we suggest that a triquark field,\nantisymmetric in both flavor and color, combine to form hexaquarks.\n", "  We use an effective-field-theory framework to analyze the Efimov effect in\nheteronuclear three-body systems consisting of two species of atoms with a\nlarge interspecies scattering length. In the leading-order description of this\ntheory, various three-body observables in heteronuclear mixtures can be\nuniversally parameterized by one three-body parameter. We present the\nnext-to-leading corrections, which include the effects of the finite\ninterspecies effective range and the finite intraspecies scattering length, to\nvarious three-body observables. We show that only one additional three-body\nparameter is required to render the theory predictive at this order. By\nincluding the effective range and intraspecies scattering length corrections,\nwe derive a set of universal relations that connect the different Efimov\nfeatures near the interspecies Feshbach resonance. Furthermore, we show that\nthese relations can be interpreted in terms of the running of the three-body\ncounterterms that naturally emerge from proper renormalization. Finally, we\nmake predictions for recombination observables of a number of atomic systems\nthat are of experimental interest.\n", "  LOFAR is the LOw Frequency Radio interferometer ARray located at mid-latitude\n($52^{\\circ} 53'N$). Here, we present results on ionospheric structures derived\nfrom 29 LOFAR nighttime observations during the winters of 2012/2013 and\n2013/2014. We show that LOFAR is able to determine differential ionospheric TEC\nvalues with an accuracy better than 1 mTECU over distances ranging between 1\nand 100 km. For all observations the power law behavior of the phase structure\nfunction is confirmed over a long range of baseline lengths, between $1$ and\n$80$ km, with a slope that is in general larger than the $5/3$ expected for\npure Kolmogorov turbulence. The measured average slope is $1.89$ with a one\nstandard deviation spread of $0.1$. The diffractive scale, i.e. the length\nscale where the phase variance is $1\\, \\mathrm{rad^2}$, is shown to be an\neasily obtained single number that represents the ionospheric quality of a\nradio interferometric observation. A small diffractive scale is equivalent to\nhigh phase variability over the field of view as well as a short time coherence\nof the signal, which limits calibration and imaging quality. For the studied\nobservations the diffractive scales at $150$ MHz vary between $3.5$ and $30\\,$\nkm. A diffractive scale above $5$ km, pertinent to about $90 \\%$ of the\nobservations, is considered sufficient for the high dynamic range imaging\nneeded for the LOFAR Epoch of Reionization project. For most nights the\nionospheric irregularities were anisotropic, with the structures being aligned\nwith the Earth magnetic field in about $60\\%$ of the observations.\n", "  The high degree of symmetry renders the dynamics of cosmological as well as\nsome black hole spacetimes describable by a system of finite degrees of\nfreedom. These systems are generally known as minisuperspace models. One of\ntheir important key features is the invariance of the corresponding reduced\nactions under reparametrizations of the independent variable, a fact that can\nbe seen as the remnant of the general covariance of the full theory. In the\ncase of a system of $n$ degrees of freedom, described by a Lagrangian quadratic\nin velocities, one can use the lapse by either gauge fixing it or letting it be\ndefined by the constraint and subsequently substitute into the rest of the\nequations. In the first case, the system is solvable for $n$ accelerations and\nthe constraint becomes a restriction among constants. In the second case, the\nsystem can only be solved for $n-1$ accelerations and the \"gauge\" freedom is\ntransferred to the choice of one of the scalar degrees of freedom. In this\npaper, we take the second path and express all $n-1$ scalar degrees of freedom\nin terms of the remaining one, say $q$. By considering these $n-1$ degrees of\nfreedom as arbitrary but given functions of $q$, we manage to extract a two\ndimensional pure gauge system consisting of the lapse $N$ and the arbitrary\n$q$: in a way, we decouple the reparametrization invariance from the rest of\nthe equations of motion. The solution of the corresponding quantum two\ndimensional system is used for the definition of a generalized probability for\nevery configuration $f^i (q)$, be it classical or not. The main result is that,\ninterestingly enough, this probability attains its extrema on the classical\nsolution of the initial $n$-dimensional system.\n", "  Three-generation MSW effect in curved spacetime is studied and a brief\ndiscussion on the gravitational correction to the neutrino self-energy is\ngiven. The modified mixing parameters and corresponding conversion\nprobabilities of neutrinos after traveling through celestial objects of\nconstant densities are obtained. The method to distinguish between the normal\nhierarchy and inverted hierarchy is discussed in this framework. Due to the\ngravitational redshift of energy, in some extreme situations, the resonance\nenergy of neutrinos might be shifted noticeably and the gravitational effect on\nthe self-energy of neutrino becomes significant at the vicinities of spacetime\nsingularities.\n", "  We investigated the typical environment and physical properties of \"red\ndiscs\" and \"blue bulges\", comparing those to the \"normal\" objects in the blue\ncloud and red sequence. Our sample is composed of cluster members and field\ngalaxies at $z \\le 0.1$, so that we can assess the impact of the local and\nglobal environment. We find that disc galaxies display a strong dependence on\nenvironment, becoming redder for higher densities. This effect is more\npronounced for objects within the virial radius, being also strong related to\nthe stellar mass. We find that local and global environment affect galaxy\nproperties, but the most effective parameter is stellar mass. We find evidence\nfor a scenario where \"blue discs\" are transformed into \"red discs\" as they grow\nin mass and move to the inner parts of clusters. From the metallicity\ndifferences of red and blue discs, and the analysis of their star formation\nhistories, we suggest the quenching process is slow. We estimate a quenching\ntime scale of $\\sim $ 2$-$3 Gyr. We also find from the sSFR$-$M$_*$ plane that\n\"red discs\" gradually change as they move into clusters. The \"blue bulges\" have\nmany similar properties than \"blue discs\", but some of the former show strong\nsigns of asymmetry. The high asymmetry \"blue bulges\" display enhanced recent\nstar formation compared to their regular counterparts. That indicates some of\nthese systems may have increased their star formation due to mergers.\nNonetheless, there may not be a single evolutionary path for these blue\nearly-type objects.\n", "  Context: The cross-covariance of solar oscillations observed at pairs of\npoints on the solar surface is a fundamental ingredient in time-distance\nhelioseismology. Wave travel times are extracted from the cross-covariance\nfunction and are used to infer the physical conditions in the solar interior.\nAims: Understanding the statistics of the two-point cross-covariance function\nis a necessary step towards optimizing the measurement of travel times.\nMethods: By modeling stochastic solar oscillations, we evaluate the variance of\nthe cross-covariance function as function of time-lag and distance between the\ntwo points. Results: We show that the variance of the cross-covariance is\nindependent of both time-lag and distance in the far field, i.e., when they are\nlarge compared to the coherence scales of the solar oscillations. Conclusions:\nThe constant noise level for the cross-covariance means that the\nsignal-to-noise ratio for the cross-covariance is proportional to the amplitude\nof the expectation value of the cross-covariance. This observation is important\nfor planning data analysis efforts.\n", "  We address the issue of the renormalizability of the gauge-invariant\nnon-local dimension-two operator $A^2_{\\rm min}$, whose minimization is defined\nalong the gauge orbit. Despite its non-local character, we show that the\noperator $A^2_{\\rm min}$ can be cast in local form through the introduction of\nan auxiliary Stueckelberg field. The localization procedure gives rise to an\nunconventional kind of Stueckelberg-type action which turns out to be\nrenormalizable to all orders of perturbation theory. In particular, as a\nconsequence of its gauge invariance, the anomalous dimension of the operator\n$A^2_{\\rm min}$ turns out to be independent from the gauge parameter $\\alpha$\nentering the gauge-fixing condition, being thus given by the anomalous\ndimension of the operator $A^2$ in the Landau gauge.\n", "  We propose simple models for the current-voltage characteristics of typical\nJosephson ratchets. We consider the case of a ratchet working against a\nconstant applied counter force and derive analytical expressions for the key\ncharacteristics of such a ratchet: rectification curve, stopping force, input\nand output powers and rectification efficiency. Optimization of the ratchet\nperformance is discussed.\n", "  We derive general expressions for the free energy, entropy production and\nentropy extraction rates for a Brownian particle that walks in a viscous medium\nwhere the dynamics of its motion is governed by the Langevin equation. It is\nshown that when the system is out of equilibrium, it constantly produces\nentropy and at the same time extracts entropy out of the system. Its entropy\nproduction and extraction rates decrease in time and saturate to a constant\nvalue. In long time limit, the rate of entropy production balances the rate of\nentropy extraction and at equilibrium both entropy production and extraction\nrates become zero. Moreover, considering different model systems, not only we\ninvestigate how various thermodynamic quantities behave in time but also we\ndiscuss the fluctuation theorem in detail.\n", "  We consider the effective hydrophobicity of a periodically grooved surface\nimmersed in liquid, with trapped shear-free bubbles protruding between the\nno-slip ridges at a $\\pi/2$ contact angle. Specifically, we carry out a\nsingular-perturbation analysis in the limit $\\epsilon\\ll1$ where the bubbles\nare closely spaced, finding the effective slip length (normalised by the bubble\nradius) for longitudinal flow along the the ridges as\n${\\pi}/{\\sqrt{2\\epsilon}}-(12/\\pi)\\ln 2 + (13\\pi/24)\\sqrt{2\\epsilon}+\no(\\sqrt{\\epsilon})$, the small parameter $\\epsilon$ being the planform solid\nfraction. The square-root divergence highlights the strong hydrophobic\ncharacter of this configuration; this leading singular term (along with the\nthird term) follows from a local lubrication-like analysis of the gap regions\nbetween the bubbles, together with general matching considerations and a global\nconservation relation. The $O(1)$ constant term is found by matching with a\nleading-order solution in the \"outer'\" region, where the bubbles appear to be\ntouching. We find excellent agreement between our slip-length formula and a\nnumerical scheme recently derived using a \"unified-transform\" method (D.\nCrowdy, IMA J. Appl. Math., 80 1902, 2015). The comparison demonstrates that\nour asymptotic formula, together with the diametric \"dilute-limit\"\napproximation (D. Crowdy, J. Fluid Mech., 791 R7, 2016), provides an elementary\nanalytical description for essentially arbitrary no-slip fractions.\n", "  We carry out a theoretical analysis of a prototypical Majorana system, which\ndemonstrates the existence of a Majorana-mediated many-body state and an\nassociated intermediate low-energy fixed point. Starting from two Majorana\nbound states, hosted by a Coulomb-blockaded topological superconductor and each\ncoupled to a separate lead, we derive an effective low-energy Hamiltonian,\nwhich displays a Kondo-like character. However, in contrast to the Kondo model\nwhich tends to a strong- or weak-coupling limit under renormalization, we show\nthat this effective Hamiltonian scales to an intermediate fixed point, whose\nexistence is contingent upon teleportation via the Majorana modes. We conclude\nby determining experimental signatures of this fixed point, as well as the\nexotic many-body state associated with it.\n", "  This year the discovery of femtosecond demagnetization by laser pulses is 20\nyears old. For the first time this milestone work by Bigot and coworkers gave\ninsight in a very direct way into the time scales of microscopic interactions\nthat connect the spin and electron system. While intense discussions in the\nfield were fueled by the complexity of the processes in the past, it now became\nevident that it is a puzzle of many different parts. Rather than giving an\noverview that has been presented in previous reviews on ultrafast processes in\nferromagnets, this perspective will show that with our current depth of\nknowledge the first real applications are on their way: THz spintronics and\nall-optical spin manipulation are becoming more and more feasible. The aim of\nthis perspective is to point out where we can connect the different puzzle\npieces of understanding gathered over 20 years to develop novel applications.\nbased on many observations in a large number of experiments. Differences in the\ntheoretical models arise from the localized and delocalized nature of\nferromagnetism. Transport effects are intrinsically non-local in spintronic\ndevices and at interfaces. We review the need for multiscale modeling to\naddress processes starting from electronic excitation of the spin system on the\npicometer length scale and sub-femtosecond time scale, to spin wave generation,\nand towards the modeling of ultrafast phase transitions that altogether\ndetermine the response time of the ferromagnetic system. Today, our current\nunderstanding gives rise to the first real applications of ultrafast spin\nphysics for ultrafast magnetism control: THz spintronic devices. This makes the\nfield of ultrafast spin-dynamics an emerging topic open for many researchers\nright now.\n", "  It has been proposed that the observed diphoton excess at 750 GeV could be\nexplained within the constrained minimal supersymmetric standard model via\nresonantly produced stop bound states. We reanalyze this scenario critically\nand extend previous work to include the constraints from the stability of the\nelectroweak vacuum and from the decays of the stoponium into a pair of Higgs\nbosons. It is shown that the interesting regions of parameter space with a\nlight stop and Higgs of the desired mass are ruled out by these constraints.\nThis conclusion is not affected by the presence of the bound states because the\nbinding energy is usually very small in the regions of parameter space which\ncan explain the Higgs mass. Thus, this also leads to strong constraints on the\ndiphoton production cross section which is in general too small.\n", "  As a result of the Standard Model chiral anomalies, baryon number is violated\nin the early universe in the presence of a hypermagnetic field with varying\nhelicity. We investigate whether the matter / anti-matter asymmetry of the\nuniverse can be created from the decaying helicity of a primordial\n(hyper)magnetic field before and after the electroweak phase transition. In\nthis model, baryogenesis occurs without $(B-L)$-violation, since the $(B+L)$\nasymmetry generated by the hypermagnetic field counteracts the washout by\nelectroweak sphalerons. At the electroweak crossover, the hypermagnetic field\nbecomes an electromagnetic field, which does not source $(B+L)$. Although the\nsphalerons remain in equilibrium for a time, washout is avoided since the\ndecaying magnetic helicity sources chirality. The relic baryon asymmetry is\nfixed when the electroweak sphaleron freezes out. Under reasonable assumptions,\na baryon asymmetry of $n_B / s \\simeq 4 \\times 10^{-12}$ can be generated from\na maximally helical, right-handed (hyper)magnetic field that has a field\nstrength of $B_0 \\simeq 10^{-14} \\, {\\rm Gauss}$ and coherence length of\n$\\lambda_{0} \\simeq 1 \\, {\\rm pc}$ today. Relaxing an assumption that relates\n$\\lambda_0$ to $B_0$, the model predicts $n_B / s \\gtrsim 10^{-10}$, which\ncould potentially explain the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe.\n", "  Current $\\gamma$-ray telescopes suffer from a gap in sensitivity in the\nenergy range between 100keV and 100MeV, and no polarisation measurement has\never been done on cosmic sources above 1MeV. Past and present e$^+$e$^-$ pair\ntelescopes are limited at lower energies by the multiple scattering of\nelectrons in passive tungsten converter plates. This results in low angular\nresolution, and, consequently, a drop in sensitivity to point sources below\n1GeV. The polarisation information, which is carried by the azimuthal angle of\nthe conversion plane, is lost for the same reasons.\n  HARPO (Hermetic ARgon POlarimeter) is an R\\&D program to characterise the\noperation of a gaseous detector (a Time Projection Chamber or TPC) as a high\nangular-resolution and sensitivity telescope and polarimeter for $\\gamma$ rays\nfrom cosmic sources. It represents a first step towards a future space\ninstrument in the MeV-GeV range.\n  We built and characterised a 30cm cubic demonstrator [SPIE 91441M], and put\nit in a polarised $\\gamma$-ray beam at the NewSUBARU accelerator in Japan. Data\nwere taken at photon energies from 1.74MeV to 74MeV, and with different\npolarisation configurations.\n  We describe the experimental setup in beam. We then describe the software we\ndeveloped to reconstruct the photon conversion events, with special focus on\nlow energies. We also describe the thorough simulation of the detector used to\ncompare results. Finally we will present the performance of the detector as\nextracted from this analysis and preliminary measurements of the polarisation\nasymmetry.\n  This beam-test qualification of a gas TPC prototype in a $\\gamma$-ray beam\ncould open the way to high-performance $\\gamma$-ray astronomy and polarimetry\nin the MeV-GeV energy range in the near future.\n", "  (Abridged) We present Herschel/HIFI spectra of the H2O 1113 GHz and H2O+ 1115\nGHz lines toward five nearby prototypical starburst/AGN systems, and OH+ 971\nGHz spectra toward three of these. The beam size of 20\" corresponds to\nresolutions between 0.35 and 7 kpc. The observed line profiles range from pure\nabsorption (NGC 4945, M82) to P-Cygni indicating outflow (NGC 253, Arp 220) and\ninverse P-Cygni indicating infall (Cen A). The similarity of the H2O, OH+, and\nH2O+ profiles to each other and to HI indicates that diffuse and dense gas\nphases are well mixed. We estimate column densities assuming negligible\nexcitation (for absorption features) and using a non-LTE model (for emission\nfeatures), adopting calculated collision data for H2O and OH+, and rough\nestimates for H2O+. Column densities range from ~10^13 to ~10^15 cm^-2 for each\nspecies, and are similar between absorption and emission components, indicating\nthat the nuclear region does not contribute much to the emission in these\nground-state lines. The N(H2O)/N(H2O+) ratios of 1.4-5.6 indicate an origin of\nthe lines in diffuse gas, and the N(OH+)/N(H2O+) ratios of 1.6-3.1 indicate a\nlow H2 fraction (~11%) in the gas.\n  Adopting recent Galactic values for the average gas density and the\nionization efficiency, we find ionization rates for our sample galaxies of\n~3x10^-16 s^-1 which are similar to the value for the Galactic disk, but ~10x\nbelow that of the Galactic Center and ~100x below estimates for AGN from\nexcited-state H3O+ lines. We conclude that the ground-state lines of water and\nits associated ions probe primarily non-nuclear gas in the disks of these\ncentrally active galaxies. Our data thus provide evidence for a decrease in\nionization rate by a factor of ~10 from the nuclei to the disks of galaxies, as\nfound before for the Milky Way.\n", "  We study the lowest-mass eigenstates of $\\phi^4_{1+1}$ theory with both odd\nand even numbers of constituents. The calculation is carried out as a\ndiagonalization of the light-front Hamiltonian in a Fock-space representation.\nIn each Fock sector a fully symmetric polynomial basis is used to represent the\nFock wave function. Convergence is investigated with respect to the number of\nbasis polynomials in each sector and with respect to the number of sectors. The\ndependence of the spectrum on the coupling strength is used to estimate the\ncritical coupling for the positive-mass-squared case. An apparent discrepancy\nwith equal-time calculations of the critical coupling is resolved by an\nappropriate mass renormalization.\n", "  We construct various self-similar configurations using parallel\n$\\delta$-function plates and show that it is possible to evaluate the Casimir\ninteraction energy of these configurations using the idea of self-similarity\nalone. We restrict our analysis to interactions mediated by a scalar field, but\nthe extension to electromagnetic field is immediate. Our work unveils an easy\nand powerful method that can be easily employed to calculate the Casimir\nenergies of a class of self-similar configurations. As a highlight, in an\nexample, we determine the Casimir interaction energy of a stack of parallel\nplates constructed by positioning $\\delta$-function plates at the points\nconstituting the Cantor set, a prototype of a fractal. This, to our knowledge,\nis the first time that the Casimir energy of a fractal configuration has been\nreported. Remarkably, the Casimir energy of some of the configurations we\nconsider turn out to be positive, and a few even have zero Casimir energy. For\nthe case of positive Casimir energy that is monotonically decreasing as the\nstacking parameter increases the interpretation is that the pressure of vacuum\ntends to inflate the infinite stack of plates. We further support our results,\nderived using the idea of self-similarity alone, by rederiving them using the\nGreen's function formalism. These expositions gives us insight into the\nconnections between the regularization methods used in quantum field theories\nand regularized sums of divergent series in number theory.\n", "  The Immirzi parameter is promoted to be a scalar field and the Hamiltonian\nanalysis of the corresponding dynamical system is performed in the presence of\ngravity. We identified some SU(2) connections, generalizing Ashtekar-Barbero\nvariables, and we rewrite the constraints in terms of them, setting the\nclassical formulation suitable for loop quantization. Then, we consider the\nreduced system obtained when restricting to a flat isotropic cosmological\nmodel. By mimicking loop quantization via an effective semiclassical treatment,\nwe outline how quantum effects are able to tame the initial singularity both in\nsynchronous time and when the Immirzi field is taken as a relational time.\n", "  The active galactic nucleus (AGN) NGC 7213 shows a complex correlation\nbetween the monochromatic radio luminosity $L_R$ and the 2--10 keV X-ray\nluminosity $L_X$, i.e. the correlation is unusually weak with $p\\sim 0$ (in the\nform $L_R\\propto L_X^p$) when $L_X$ is below a critical luminosity, and steep\nwith $p>1$ when $L_X$ is above that luminosity. Such a hybrid correlation in\nindividual AGNs is unexpected as it deviates from the Fundamental Plane of AGN\nactivity. Interestingly, a similar correlation pattern is observed in the black\nhole X-ray binary H1743--322, where it has been modelled by switching between\ndifferent modes of accretion. We propose that the flat $L_R$--$L_X$ correlation\nof NGC 7213 is due to the presence of a luminous hot accretion flow, an\naccretion model whose radiative efficiency is sensitive to the accretion rate.\nGiven the low luminosity of the source, $L_X\\sim 10^{-4}$ of the Eddington\nluminosity, the viscosity parameter is determined to be small, $\\alpha\\approx\n0.01$. We also modelled the broad-band spectrum from radio to $\\gamma$-rays,\nthe time lag between the radio and X-ray light curves, and the implied size and\nthe Lorentz factor of the radio jet. We predict that NGC 7213 will enter into a\ntwo-phase accretion regime when $L_X > 1.5 \\times 10^{42}\\, {\\rm erg\\,s^{-1}}$.\nWhen this happens, we predict a softening of the X-ray spectrum with the\nincreasing flux and a steep radio/X-ray correlation.\n", "  We study a geometric transition in non-perturbative topological string. We\nconsider two cases. One is the geometric transition from the closed topological\nstring on the local $\\mathcal{B}_{3}$ to the closed topological string on the\nresolved conifold. The other is the geometric transition from the closed\ntopological string on the local $\\mathcal{B}_{3}$ to the open topological\nstring on the resolved conifold with a toric A-brane. We find that, in both\ncases, the geometric transition can be applied for the non-perturbative\ntopological string. We also find the corrections of the value of K\\\"ahler\nparameters at which the geometric transition occurs.\n", "  The Fokker--Planck equation describes the evolution of a probability\ndistribution towards equilibrium--the flow parameter is the equilibration time.\nAssuming the distribution remains normalizable for all times, it is equivalent\nto an open hierarchy of equations for the moments. Ways of closing this\nhierarchy have been proposed; ways of explicitly solving the hierarchy\nequations have received much less attention. In this paper we show that much\ninsight can be gained by mapping the Fokker--Planck equation to a Schr\\\"odinger\nequation, where Planck's constant is identified with the diffusion coefficient.\n", "  The effects of event-by-event fluctuations in the initial geometry of the\ncolliding nuclei are important in the analysis of final flow observables in\nrelativistic heavy-ion collisions. We use hydrodynamic simulations to study the\namplitude correlations between different orders of event-by-event fluctuating\nanisotropic flow harmonics. While the general trends seen in the experimental\ndata are qualitatively reproduced by the model, deviations in detail, in\nparticular for peripheral collisions, point to the need for more elaborate\nfuture calculations with a hybrid approach that describes the late hadronic\nstage of the evolution microscopically. It is demonstrated explicitly that the\nobserved anti-correlation between $v_2$ and $v_3$ is the consequence of\napproximately linear hydrodynamic response to a similar anti-correlation of the\ncorresponding initial eccentricities $\\epsilon_2$ and $\\epsilon_3$. For\n$n{\\,>\\,}3$, the hydrodynamic correlations between $v_{2,3}$ and $v_n$ deviate\nfrom the rescaled correlations among the corresponding initial eccentricities,\ndemonstrating nonlinear mode coupling effect in higher order flows.\n", "  The moment of inertia, the spin-induced quadrupole moment, and the tidal Love\nnumber of neutron-star and quark-star models are related through some relations\nwhich depend only mildly on the stellar equation of state. These \"I-Love-Q\"\nrelations have important implications for astrophysics and gravitational-wave\nastronomy. An interesting problem is whether similar relations hold for other\ncompact objects and how they approach the black-hole limit. To answer these\nquestions, here we investigate the deformation properties of a large class of\nthin-shell gravastars, which are exotic compact objects that do not possess an\nevent horizon nor a spacetime singularity. Working in a small-spin and\nsmall-tidal field expansion, we calculate the moment of inertia, the quadrupole\nmoment, and the (quadrupolar electric) tidal Love number of gravastars with a\npolytropic thin shell. The I-Love-Q relations of a thin-shell gravastar are\ndrastically different from those of an ordinary neutron star. The Love number\nand quadrupole moment are negative for less compact models and the I-Love-Q\nrelations continuously approach the black-hole limit. We consider a variety of\npolytropic equations of state for the matter shell, and find no universality in\nthe I-Love-Q relations. However, we cannot deny the possibility that, similarly\nto the neutron-star case, an approximate universality might emerge for a\nlimited class of equations of state. Finally, we discuss how a measurement of\nthe tidal deformability from the gravitational-wave detection of a\ncompact-binary inspiral can be used to constrain exotic compact objects like\ngravastars.\n", "  Energy levels of 30 low-lying states of Lu2+ and allowed electric-dipole\nmatrix elements between these states are evaluated using a relativistic\nall-order method in which all single, double and partial triple excitations of\nDirac-Fock wave functions are included to all orders of perturbation theory.\nMatrix elements are critically evaluated for their accuracy and recommended\nvalues of the matrix elements are given together with uncertainty estimates.\nLine strengths, transition rates and lifetimes of the metastable 5d(3/2) and\n5d(5/2) states are calculated. Recommended values are given for static\npolarizabilities of the 6s, 5d and 6p states and tensor polarizabilities of the\n5d and 6p(3/2) states. Uncertainties of the polarizability values are estimated\nin all cases. The blackbody radiation shift of the 6s(1/2)-5d(5/2) transition\nfrequency of the Lu2+ ion is calculated with the aid of the recommended scalar\npolarizabilities of the 6s(1/2) and 5d(5/2) states. Finally, A and B hyperfine\nconstants are determined for states of 175Lu2+ with n <= 9. This work provides\nrecommended values of transition matrix elements, polarizabilities and\nhyperfine constants of Lu2+, critically evaluated for accuracy, for benchmark\ntests of high-precision theoretical methodology and planning of future\nexperiments.\n", "  In the context of a recoil damping analysis, we have designed and produced a\nmembrane resonator equipped with a specific on-chip structure working as a\n\"loss shield\" for a circular membrane. In this device the vibrations of the\nmembrane, with a quality factor of $10^7$, reach the limit set by the intrinsic\ndissipation in silicon nitride, for all the modes and regardless of the modal\nshape, also at low frequency. Guided by our theoretical model of the loss\nshield, we describe the design rationale of the device, which can be used as\neffective replacement of commercial membrane resonators in advanced\noptomechanical setups, also at cryogenic temperatures.\n", "  Achieving full control of the time-evolution of a many-body quantum system is\ncurrently a major goal in physics. In this work we investigate the different\nways in which the controllability of a quantum system can be influenced by its\ncomplexity, or even its chaotic properties. By using optimal control theory, we\nare able to derive the control fields necessary to drive various physical\nprocesses in a spin chain. Then, we study the spectral properties of such\nfields and how they relate to different aspects of the system complexity. We\nfind that the spectral bandwidth of the fields is, quite generally, independent\nof the system dimension. Conversely, the spectral complexity of such fields\ndoes increase with the number of particles. Nevertheless, we find that the\nregular o chaotic nature of the system does not affect signficantly its\ncontrollability.\n", "  Locomotion via cyclic moves presents a challenge to mesoscopic objects in\noverdamped environments, where time reversibility may prevent directed motion.\nMost reported cyclic movers exploit anisotropic drag to push themselves\nforward. Under an oscillating drive, however, anisotropic drag enables\nlocomotion only if the objects can change their shape. Here, we present a\nstrategy that unexpectedly enables structurally invariant objects to move under\noscillating fields. The objects are self-assembled clusters of magnetic\nparticles that exhibit an off-centered dipole moment. By theoretical modeling\nand in experiments with magnetic Janus particles, we demonstrate that the\ninteraction between such anisotropic particles in the cluster breaks time\nreversibility. Experimentally, we show that the magnetic configuration of a\ncluster determines its motion path. We realize stirrers and steerable movers\nwith helical or directed path using the same particle system. The presented\nstrategy based on internal interactions establishes a counterpart to locomotion\nvia anisotropic drag.\n", "  Commodity video-gaming hardware (consoles, graphics cards, tablets, etc.)\nperformance has been advancing at a rapid pace owing to strong consumer demand\nand stiff market competition. Gaming hardware devices are currently amongst the\nmost powerful and cost-effective computational technologies available in\nquantity. In this article, we evaluate a sample of current generation\nvideo-gaming hardware devices for scientific computing and compare their\nperformance with specialized supercomputing general purpose graphics processing\nunits (GPGPUs). We use the OpenCL SHOC benchmark suite, which is a measure of\nthe performance of compute hardware on various different scientific application\nkernels, and also a popular public distributed computing application,\nEinstein@Home in the field of gravitational physics for the purposes of this\nevaluation.\n", "  The influence of spin-orbit interactions on the Kondo effect has been under\ndebate recently. Studies conducted recently on a system composed by an Anderson\nimpurity on a 2DEG with Rashba spin-orbit have been shown that it can enhance\nor suppress the Kondo temperature ($T_{\\rm K}$), depending on the relative\nenergy level position of the impurity with respect to the particle-hole\nsymmetric point. Here we investigate a system composed by a single Anderson\nimpurity side-coupled to a quantum wire with spin-orbit coupling (SOC). We\nderive an effective Hamiltonian in which the Kondo coupling is modified by the\nSOC. In addition, the Hamiltonian contains two other scattering terms, the so\ncalled Dzaloshinskyi-Moriya interaction, know to appear in these systems, and a\nnew one describing processes similar to the Elliott-Yafet scattering\nmechanisms. By performing a renormalization group analysis on the effective\nHamiltonian, we find that the correction on the Kondo coupling due to the SOC\nfavors and enhancement of the Kondo temperature even in the particle-hole\nsymmetric point of the Anderson model, agreeing with the NRG results. Moreover,\naway from the particle-hole symmetric point, $T_{\\rm K}$ always increases with\nthe SOC, accordingly with the previous renormalization group analysis.\n", "  We report a measurement of the CP violation parameter $\\varphi_1$ obtained in\na time-dependent analysis of $B^0\\to\\bar{D}{}^{(*)0}h^0$ decays followed by\n$\\bar{D}{}^0\\to K_S^0\\pi^+\\pi^-$ decay. A model-independent measurement is\nperformed using the binned Dalitz plot technique. The measured value is\n$\\varphi_1 = 11.7^{\\circ}\\pm7.8^{\\circ}({\\rm stat.})\\pm 2.1^{\\circ}({\\rm\nsyst.})$. Treating $\\sin{2\\varphi_1}$ and $\\cos{2\\varphi_1}$ as independent\nparameters, we obtain $\\sin{2\\varphi_1} = 0.43\\pm 0.27({\\rm stat.})\\pm\n0.08({\\rm syst.})$ and $\\cos{2\\varphi_1} = 1.06\\pm 0.33({\\rm\nstat.})^{+0.21}_{-0.15}({\\rm syst.})$. The results are obtained with a full\ndata sample of $772 \\times 10^6 B\\bar{B}$ pairs collected near the\n$\\Upsilon(4S)$ resonance with the Belle detector at the KEKB asymmetric-energy\n$e^+e^-$ collider.\n", "  We present a study of the parsec-scale multi-frequency properties of the\nquasar S4 1030+61 during a prolonged radio and gamma-ray activity. Observations\nwere performed within Fermi gamma-ray telescope, OVRO 40-m telescope and MOJAVE\nVLBA monitoring programs, covering five years from 2009. The data are\nsupplemented by four-epoch VLBA observations at 5, 8, 15, 24, and 43 GHz, which\nwere triggered by the bright gamma-ray flare, registered in the quasar in 2010.\nThe S4 1030+61 jet exhibits an apparent superluminal velocity of (6.4+-0.4)c\nand does not show ejections of new components in the observed period, while\ndecomposition of the radio light curve reveals nine prominent flares. The\nmeasured variability parameters of the source show values typical for\nFermi-detected quasars. Combined analysis of radio and gamma-ray emission\nimplies a spatial separation between emitting regions at these bands of about\n12 pc and locates the gamma-ray emission within a parsec from the central\nengine. We detected changes in the value and direction of the linear\npolarization and the Faraday rotation measure. The value of the intrinsic\nbrightness temperature of the core is above the equipartition state, while its\nvalue as a function of distance from the core is well approximated by the\npower-law. Altogether these results show that the radio flaring activity of the\nquasar is accompanied by injection of relativistic particles and energy losses\nat the jet base, while S4 1030+61 has a stable, straight jet well described by\nstandard conical jet theories.\n", "  The Coulomb gap observed in tunneling between parallel two-dimensional\nelectron systems, each at half filling of the lowest Landau level, is found to\ndepend sensitively on the presence of an in-plane magnetic field. Especially at\nlow electron density, the width of the Coulomb gap at first increases sharply\nwith in-plane field, but then abruptly levels off. This behavior appears to\ncoincide with the known transition from partial to complete spin polarization\nof the half-filled lowest Landau level. The tunneling gap therefore opens a new\nwindow onto the spin configuration of two-dimensional electron systems at high\nmagnetic field.\n", "  The use of an electron beam to remove ultracold atoms from selected sites in\nan optical lattice has opened up new opportunities to study transport in\nquantum systems [R. Labouvie {\\it et al.\\ }, Phys.\\ Rev.\\ Lett.\\ {\\bf 115},\n050601 (2015)]. Inspired by this experimental result, we examine the effects of\nnumber difference, dephasing, and initial quantum statistics on the filling of\nan initially depleted middle well in the three-well inline Bose-Hubbard model.\nWe find that the well-known phenomenon of macroscopic self-trapping is the main\ncontributor to oscillatory negative differential conductivity in our model,\nwith phase diffusion being a secondary effect. However, we find that phase\ndiffusion is required for the production of direct atomic current, with the\ncoherent process showing damped oscillatory currents. We also find that our\nresults are highly dependent on the initial quantum states of the atoms in the\nsystem.\n", "  Low-temperature refrigeration is of crucial importance in fundamental\nresearch of condensed matter physics, as the investigations of fascinating\nquantum phenomena, such as superconductivity, superfluidity and quantum\ncriticality, often require refrigeration down to very low temperatures.\nCurrently, cryogenic refrigerators with $^3$He gas are widely used for cooling\nbelow 1 Kelvin. However, usage of the gas is being increasingly difficult due\nto the current world-wide shortage. Therefore, it is important to consider\nalternative methods of refrigeration. Here, we show that a new type of\nrefrigerant, super-heavy electron metal, YbCo$_2$Zn$_{20}$, can be used for\nadiabatic demagnetization refrigeration, which does not require 3He gas. A\nnumber of advantages includes much better metallic thermal conductivity\ncompared to the conventional insulating refrigerants. We also demonstrate that\nthe cooling performance is optimized in Yb$_{1-x}$Sc$_x$Co$_2$Zn$_{20}$ by\npartial Sc substitution with $x\\sim$0.19. The substitution induces chemical\npressure which drives the materials close to a zero-field quantum critical\npoint. This leads to an additional enhancement of the magnetocaloric effect in\nlow fields and low temperatures enabling final temperatures well below 100 mK.\nSuch performance has up to now been restricted to insulators. Since nearly a\ncentury the same principle of using local magnetic moments has been applied for\nadiabatic demagnetization cooling. This study opens new possibilities of using\nitinerant magnetic moments for the cryogen-free refrigeration.\n", "  The origin of the observed steep rotation curves of blue compact dwarf\ngalaxies (BCDs) remains largely unexplained by theoretical models of BCD\nformation. We therefore investigate the rotation curves in BCDs formed from\nmergers between gas-rich dwarf irregular galaxies based on the results of\nnumerical simulations for BCD formation. The principal results are as follows.\nThe dark matter of merging dwarf irregulars undergoes a central concentration\nso that the central density can become up to six times higher than those of the\ninitial dwarf irregulars. However, the more compact dark matter halo alone can\nnot reproduce the gradient differences observed between dwarf irregulars and\nBCDs. We provide further support that the central concentration of gas due to\nrapid gas-transfer to the central regions of dwarf--dwarf mergers is\nresponsible for the observed difference in rotation curve gradients. The BCDs\nwith central gas concentration formed from merging can thus show steeply rising\nrotation curves in their central regions. Such gas concentration is also\nresponsible for central starbursts of BCDs and the high central surface\nbrightness and is consistent with previous BCD studies. We discuss the\nrelationship between rotational velocity gradient and surface brightness, the\ndependence of BCD rotation curves on star formation threshold density,\nprogenitor initial profile, interaction type and merger mass ratio, as well as\npotential evolutionary links between dwarf irregulars, BCDs and compact dwarf\nirregulars.\n", "  Using nanoparticles to impart extrinsic rippling in graphene is a relatively\nnew method to induce strain and to tailor the properties of graphene. Here we\nstudy the structure and elastic properties of graphene grown by chemical vapour\ndeposition and transferred onto a continuous layer of SiO2 nanoparticles with\ndiameters of around 25 nm, prepared by Langmuir-Blodgett technique on Si\nsubstrate. We show that the transferred graphene follows only roughly the\nmorphology induced by nanoparticles. The graphene membrane parts bridging the\nnanoparticles are suspended and their adhesion to the AFM tip is larger\ncompared to that of supported graphene parts. These suspended graphene regions\ncan be deformed with forces of the order of 10 nN. The elastic modulus of\ngraphene was determined from indentation measurements performed on suspended\nmembrane regions with diameters in the 100 nm range.\n", "  We construct a tight-binding model realizing one pair of Weyl nodes and three\ndistinct Weyl semimetals. In the type-I (type-II) Weyl semimetal, both nodes\nbelong to type-I (type-II) Weyl nodes. In addition, there exists a novel type,\ndubbed \"hybrid Weyl semimetal\", in which one Weyl node is of type-I while the\nother is of type-II. For the hybrid Weyl semimetal, we further demonstrate the\nbulk Fermi surfaces and the topologically protected surface states, analyze the\nunique Landau level structure and quantum oscillation, and discuss the material\nrealization.\n", "  We develop a consistent stochastic thermodynamics for environments composed\nof thermodynamic reservoirs in an external conservative force field, that is\nenvironments described by the Generalized or Gibbs canonical ensemble. We\ndemonstrate that small systems weakly coupled to such reservoirs exchange both\nheat and work by verifying a local detailed balance relation for the induced\nstochastic dynamics. Based on this analysis, we help to rationalize the\nobservation that nonthermal reservoirs can increase the efficiency of\nthermodynamic heat engines.\n", "  We construct electrically charged Kerr black holes (BHs) with scalar hair.\nFirstly, we take an uncharged scalar field, interacting with the\nelectromagnetic field only indirectly, via the background metric. The\ncorresponding family of solutions, dubbed Kerr-Newman BHs with ungauged scalar\nhair, reduces to (a sub-family of) Kerr-Newman BHs in the limit of vanishing\nscalar hair and to uncharged rotating boson stars in the limit of vanishing\nhorizon. It adds one extra parameter to the uncharged solutions: the total\nelectric charge. This leading electromagnetic multipole moment is unaffected by\nthe scalar hair and can be computed by using Gauss's law on any closed\n2-surface surrounding (a spatial section of) the event horizon. By contrast,\nthe first sub-leading electromagnetic multipole -- the magnetic dipole moment\n--, gets suppressed by the scalar hair, such that the gyromagnetic ratio is\nalways smaller than the Kerr-Newman value ($g=2$). Secondly, we consider a\ngauged scalar field and obtain a family of Kerr-Newman BHs with gauged scalar\nhair. The electrically charged scalar field now stores a part of the total\nelectric charge, which can only be computed by applying Gauss' law at spatial\ninfinity and introduces a new solitonic limit -- electrically charged rotating\nboson stars. In both cases, we analyse some physical properties of the\nsolutions.\n", "  We examine the time evolution of the frequencies of the gravitational wave\nafter the bounce within the framework of relativistic linear perturbation\ntheory using the results of one dimensional numerical simulations of\ncore-collapse supernovae. Protoneutron star models are constructed in such a\nway that the mass and radius of protoneutron star become equivalent to the\nresults obtained from the numerical simulations. Then, we find that the\nfrequencies of gravitational waves radiating from protoneutron stars strongly\ndepend on the mass and radius of protoneutron stars, but almost independently\nof the profiles of electron fraction and entropy per baryon inside the star.\nAdditionally, we find that the frequencies of gravitational waves can be\ncharacterized by the square root of the average density of protoneutron star\nirrespectively the progenitor models, which are completely different from the\nempirical formula for cold neutron stars. The dependence of the spectra on the\nmass and radius is different from that of the $g$-mode: the oscillations around\nthe surface of protoneutron stars due to the convection and the standing\naccretion-shock instability. Careful observations of the these modes of\ngravitational waves can determine the evolution of the mass and radius of\nprotoneutron stars after core-bounce. Furthermore, the expected frequencies of\ngravitational waves are around a few hundred hertz in the early stage after\nbounce, which must be a good candidate for the ground-based gravitational wave\ndetectors.\n", "  The inclusion of dissipative effects in cosmic fluids modifies their\nclustering properties and could have observable effects on the formation of\nlarge scale structures. We analyse the evolution of density perturbations of\ncold dark matter endowed with causal bulk viscosity. The perturbative analysis\nis carried out in the Newtonian approximation and the bulk viscosity is\ndescribed by the causal Israel-Stewart (IS) theory. In contrast to the\nnon-causal Eckart theory, we obtain a third order evolution equation for the\ndensity contrast that depends on three free parameters. For certain parameter\nvalues, the density contrast and growth factor in IS mimic their behaviour in\n$\\Lambda$CDM when $z \\geq 1$. Interestingly, and contrary to intuition, certain\nsets of parameters lead to an increase of the clustering.\n", "  The occurrence of stripe domains in ferromagnetic Permalloy\n(Py=Fe$_{20}$Ni$_{80}$) is a well known phenomenon which has been extensively\nobserved and characterized. This peculiar magnetic configuration appears only\nin films with a thickness above a critical value ($d_{cr}$), which is strongly\ndetermined by the sputtering conditions (i.e. deposition rate, temperature,\nmagnetic field). So far, $d_{cr}$ has usually been presented as the boundary\nbetween the homogeneous (H) and stripe-domains (SD) regime, respectively below\nand above $d_{cr}$. In this work we study the transition from the H to the SD\nregime in thin films and microstructured bridges of Py with different\nthicknesses. We find there is an intermediate regime, over a quite significant\nthickness range below d$_{cr}$, which is signaled in confined structures by a\nquickly changing domain-wall configuration and by a broadening of the\nmagnetoresistance dip at the coercive field. We call this the emerging\nstripe-domains (ESD) regime. The transition from the ESD to the SD regime is\naccompanied by a sharp increase of the magnetoresistance ratio at the thickness\nwhere stripes appear in MFM.\n", "  The pressure-temperature phase diagram of the orthorhombic ferromagnetic\nsuperconductor UCoGe was determined by resistivity measurements up to\n$10.5~$GPa. The Curie temperature $T_C$ is suppressed with pressure and\nvanishes at the critical pressure $p_c\\approx1~$GPa. Superconductivity is\nobserved in both the ferromagnetic state at low pressure, and in the\nparamagnetic state above $p_c$ up to about 4$~$GPa. Non-Fermi liquid behavior\nappears in a large pressure range. The resistivity varies linearly with\ntemperature around $p_c$ and evolves continuously with pressure to a $T^2$\nFermi-liquid behavior for $p \\gtrapprox 5$~GPa. The residual resistivity as a\nfunction of pressure shows a maximum far above $p_c$ at $p^\\star=7.2~$GPa and\nthe amplitude of the inelastic scattering term of the resistivity decreases by\nmore than one order in magnitude at $p^\\star$, which appears to mark the\nentrance into a weakly correlated regime. The pressure dependence of the upper\ncritical field for magnetic field applied along the $b$ and $c$ axis\nillustrates the drastic difference in the field dependence of the ferromagnetic\nsuperconducting pairing. While for $H\\parallel b$ axis $H_{c2}(T)$ is driven by\nthe suppression of the ferromagnetic order, it is dominated by the strong\ninitial suppression of the ferromagnetic fluctuations for a field applied in\nthe easy magnetization axis $c$.\n", "  In the first paper of this series, we introduced Voronoi correlation\nfunctions to characterize the structure of maximally random jammed (MRJ) sphere\npackings across length scales. In the present paper, we determine a variety of\ncorrelation functions that can be rigorously related to effective physical\nproperties of MRJ sphere packings and compare them to the corresponding\nstatistical descriptors for overlapping spheres and equilibrium hard-sphere\nsystems. Such structural descriptors arise in rigorous bounds and formulas for\neffective transport properties, diffusion and reactions constants, elastic\nmoduli, and electromagnetic characteristics. First, we calculate the two-point,\nsurface-void, and surface-surface correlation functions, for which we derive\nexplicit analytical formulas for finite hard-sphere packings. We show\nanalytically how the contacts between spheres in the MRJ packings translate\ninto distinct functional behaviors of these two-point correlation functions\nthat do not arise in the other two models examined here. Then, we show how the\nspectral density distinguishes the MRJ packings from the other disordered\nsystems in that the spectral density vanishes in the limit of infinite\nwavelengths. These packings are hyperuniform, which means that density\nfluctuations on large length scales are anomalously suppressed. Moreover, we\nstudy and compute exclusion probabilities and pore size distributions as well\nas local density fluctuations. We conjecture that for general disordered\nhard-sphere packings, a central limit theorem holds for the number of points\nwithin an spherical observation window. Our analysis links problems of interest\nin material science, chemistry, physics, and mathematics. In the third paper,\nwe will evaluate bounds and estimates of a host of different physical\nproperties of the MRJ sphere packings based on the structural characteristics\nanalyzed in this paper.\n", "  We reconsider gravitational corrections to vacuum decay, confirming and\nsimplifying earlier results and extending them by allowing for a non-minimal\ncoupling of the Higgs to gravity. We find that leading-order gravitational\ncorrections suppress the vacuum decay rate. Furthermore, we compute minor\ncorrections to thermal vacuum decay in the SM by adding one-loop contributions\nto the Higgs kinetic term, two-loop contributions to the Higgs potential and\nallowing for time-dependent bounces.\n", "  Spin excitations are explored in the electron-doped spin-orbit Mott insulator\n(Sr$_{1-x}$La$_{x}$)$_3$Ir$_2$O$_7$. As this bilayer square lattice system is\ndoped into the metallic regime, long-range antiferromagnetism vanishes, yet a\nspectrum of gapped spin excitation remains. Excitation lifetimes are strongly\ndamped with increasing carrier concentration, and the energy integrated\nspectral weight becomes nearly momentum independent as static spin order is\nsuppressed. Local magnetic moments, absent in the parent system, grow in\nmetallic samples and approach values consistent with one $J=\\frac{1}{2}$\nimpurity per electron doped. Our combined data suggest that the magnetic\nspectra of metallic (Sr$_{1-x}$La$_{x}$)$_3$Ir$_2$O$_7$ are best described by\nexcitations out of a disordered dimer state.\n", "  Mixed states appear naturally in experiment over pure states. So for studying\ndifferent notions of nonlocality and their relation with entanglement in\nrealistic scenarios, one needs to consider mixed states. In a recent article\n[Phys. Rev. Lett. \\textbf{108}, 020502 (2012)], a complete characterization of\nentanglement of an entire class of mixed three qubit states with the same\nsymmetry as Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state known as GHZ-symmetric states,\nhas been achieved. In this paper we investigate different notions of\nnonlocality of the same class of states. By finding the analytical expressions\nof maximum violation value of most efficient Bell inequalities we obtain the\nconditions of standard nonlocality and genuine nonlocality of this class of\nstates. Also relation between entanglement and nonlocality is discussed for\nthis class of states. Interestingly, genuine entanglement of GHZ-symmetric\nstates is necessary to reveal standard nonlocality. However, it is not\nsufficient to exploit the same.\n", "  The exploration of electric field controlled magnetism has come under\nscrutiny for its intriguing magnetoelectric phenomenon as well as technological\nadvances in spintronics. Herein, the tremendous effect of an epitaxial strain\non voltage-controlled perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (VPMA) is demonstrated\nin a transition-metal/ferromagnet/MgO (TM/FM/MgO) heterostructure from\nfirst-principles electronic structure computation. By tuning the epitaxial\nstrain in Ta/Fe/MgO as a model system of TM/FM/MgO, we find distinctly\ndifferent behaviours of VPMA from V- to {\\Lambda}-shape trends with a\nsubstantially large magnetoelectric coefficient, up to an order of 1000 fJ/Vm.\nWe further reveal that the VPMA modulation under strain is mainly governed by\nthe inherently large spin-orbit coupling of Ta 5d-Fe 3d hybridized orbitals at\nthe TM/FM interface, although the Fe 3d-O 2p hybridization at the FM/MgO is\npartly responsible in determining the PMA of Ta/Fe/MgO. These results suggest\nthat the control of epitaxial strain enables the engineering of VPMA, and\nprovides physical insights for the divergent behaviors of VPMA and\nmagnetoelectric coefficients found in TM/FM/MgO experiments.\n", "  InGaAs/InP single-photon avalanche diodes (SPADs) are widely used in\npractical applications requiring near-infrared photon counting such as quantum\nkey distribution (QKD). Photon detection efficiency and dark count rate are the\nintrinsic parameters of InGaAs/InP SPADs, due to the fact that their\nperformances cannot be improved using different quenching electronics given the\nsame operation conditions. After modeling these parameters and developing a\nsimulation platform for InGaAs/InP SPADs, we investigate the semiconductor\nstructure design and optimization. The parameters of photon detection\nefficiency and dark count rate highly depend on the variables of absorption\nlayer thickness, multiplication layer thickness, excess bias voltage and\ntemperature. By evaluating the decoy-state QKD performance, the variables for\nSPAD design and operation can be globally optimized. Such optimization from the\nperspective of specific applications can provide an effective approach to\ndesign high-performance InGaAs/InP SPADs.\n", "  We report a self-aligned, monolithic electron interferometer, consisting of\ntwo 45 nm thick silicon layers separated by 20 $\\mu$m. This interferometer was\nfabricated from a single crystal silicon cantilever on a transmission electron\nmicroscope grid by gallium focused ion-beam milling. Using this interferometer,\nwe demonstrate beam path-separation, and obtain interference fringes in a\nMach-Zehnder geometry, in an unmodified 200 kV transmission electron\nmicroscope. The fringes have a period of 0.32 nm, which corresponds to the\n$\\left[\\bar{1}\\bar{1}1\\right]$ lattice planes of silicon, and a maximum\ncontrast of 15 %. This design can potentially be scaled to millimeter-scale,\nand used in electron holography. It can also be applied to perform fundamental\nphysics experiments, such as interaction-free measurement with electrons.\n", "  We propose a numerical method using the discrete variable representation\n(DVR) for constructing real-valued Wannier functions localized in a unit cell\nfor both symmetric and asymmetric periodic potentials. We apply these results\nto finding Wannier functions for ultracold atoms trapped in laser-generated\noptical lattices. Following Kivelson \\cite{kivelson_wannier_1982}, for a\nsymmetric lattice with inversion symmetry, we construct Wannier functions as\neigen states of the position operators $\\hat x$, $\\hat y$ and $\\hat z$\nrestricted to single-particle Bloch functions belonging to one or more bands.\nTo ensure that the Wannier functions are real-valued, we numerically obtain the\nband structure and real-valued eigen states using a uniform Fourier grid DVR.\nWe then show by a comparison of tunneling energies, that the Wannier functions\nare accurate for both inversion symmetric and asymmetric potentials to better\nthan ten significant digits when using double-precision arithmetic. The\ncalculations are performed for an optical lattice with double-wells per unit\ncell with tunable asymmetry along the $x$ axis and a single sinusoidal\npotential along the perpendicular directions. Localized functions at the two\npotential minima within each unit cell are similarly constructed, but using a\nsuperposition of single-particle solutions from the two lowest bands. We\nfinally use these localized basis functions to determine the two-body\ninteraction energies in the Bose-Hubbard (BH) model, and show the dependence of\nthese energies on lattice asymmetry.\n", "  Quantum mechanics suggests that nature is discrete, with one state per phase\nspace volume $\\hbar^{3N}$. This appears to contradict the idea that the state\nof an N-particle system can have infinite precision and is described by a set\nof exponentially many complex numbers. Using a finite-temperature gas confined\nin a box as an example, this short paper argues that there are indeed limits to\nthe precision of wave functions, and that this may help at understanding the\nquantum-to-classical transition.\n", "  In central Au-Au collisions at top RHIC energy, two particle correlation\nmeasurements with identified hadron trigger have shown attenuation of near side\nproton triggered jet-like yield at intermediate transverse momentum ($p{_T}$),\n2$< p{_T} <$ 6 GeV/$\\it{c}$. The attenuation has been attributed to the\nanomalous baryon enhancement observed in the single inclusive measurements at\nthe same $p{_T}$ range. The enhancement has been found to be in agreement with\nthe models invoking coalescence of quarks as a mechanism of hadronization.\nBaryon enhancement has also been observed at LHC in the single inclusive\nspectra. We study the consequence of such an enhancement on two particle\ncorrelations at LHC energy within the framework of A Multi Phase Transport\n(AMPT) model that implements quark coalescence as a mode of hadronization. In\nthis paper we have calculated the proton over pion ratio and the near side per\ntrigger yield associated to pion and proton triggers at intermediate $p{_T}$\nfrom String Melting (SM) version of AMPT. Results obtained are contrasted with\nthe AMPT Default (Def.) which does not include coalescence. Baryon enhancement\nhas been observed in AMPT SM at intermediate $p{_T}$. Near side jet-like\ncorrelated yield associated to baryon (proton) trigger in the momentum region\nwhere baryon generation is enhanced is found to be suppressed as compared to\nthe corresponding yields for the meson (pion) trigger in most central Pb-Pb\nevents. No such effect has been found in the Default version of AMPT.\n", "  The census of the Solar neighbourhood is still incomplete, as demonstrated by\nrecent discoveries of many objects within 5-10 pc from the Sun. The area around\nthe mid-plane and bulge of the Milky Way presents the most difficulties in\nsearches for such nearby objects, and is therefore deficient in the known\npopulation. This is largely due to high stellar densities encountered.\nSpectroscopic, photometric and kinematic characterization of these objects\nallows better understand the local mass function, the binary fraction, and\nprovides new interesting targets for more detailed studies. We report the\nspectroscopic follow-up and characterisation of 12 bright high PM objects,\nidentified from the VISTA Variables in Via Lactea survey (VVV). We used the\n1.9-m telescope of the South African Astronomical Observatory (SAAO) for\nlow-resolution optical spectroscopy and spectral classification, and the\nMPG/ESP 2.2m telescope Fiber-fed Extended Range Optical Spectrograph (FEROS)\nhigh-resolution optical spectroscopy to obtain the radial and space velocities\nfor three of them. Six of our objects have co-moving companions. We derived\noptical spectral types and photometric distances, and classified all of them as\nK and M dwarfs within 27-264 pc of the Sun. Finally, we found that one of the\nsources, VVV J141421.23-602326.1 (a co-moving companion of VVV\nJ141420.55-602337.1), appears to be a rare massive white dwarf that maybe close\nto the ZZ Ceti instability strip. Many of the objects in our list are\ninteresting targets for exoplanet searches.\n", "  We study the hydrogen atom eigenstate energy and wave function in the Rindler\nspace. The probability distribution is tilted because the electric field of the\nnucleus is no longer spherically symmetric. The hydrogen atom therefore cannot\nbe treated exactly in the same way as what it is in an inertial frame. We also\nfind that if the external force accelerates only the nucleus and then the\nnucleus accelerates its surrounding electrons through electromagnetic force,\nthe electrons can tunnel through the local energy gap and split the hydrogen\natom into an ion. This is similar to what one expects from the Stark effect.\nHowever, the critical acceleration is about $3\\times 10^{22} m/s^2$. It is well\nbeyond the gravitational acceleration on a regular star surface.\n", "  The Gaia-Tycho release, scheduled for 14 September, is forecast to yield\nparallax errors of $\\sigma(\\pi)\\sim 300\\,\\mu$as for about 2 million Tycho\nstars. We show analytically that the actual performance should be $$\n\\sigma(\\pi) = {\\rm max}(\\sigma_{1991}/96,20\\,\\mu{\\rm as}) $$ where\n$\\sigma_{1991}$ is the positional error from the Hipparcos mission. For typical\nTycho stars, $\\sigma_{1991}\\sim 30\\,$mas, so this reproduces the usual claims.\nHowever, for the 100,000 star Hipparcos subset of this sample, $\\sigma_{1991}$\nis a factor 15 or more smaller. These much lower Hipparcos positional errors\napply even to stars at the Hipparcos-Tycho limit, $V\\sim 12$. This is\nespecially important for RR Lyrae stars, as well as other special classes, that\nwere systematically included in the Hipparcos catalog down to this limit\nbecause of their exceptional scientific importance. This predicted performance\nwill provide an early test of the Gaia algorithms.\n", "  Future health systems require the means to assess and track the neural and\nphysiological function of a user over long periods of time and in the\ncommunity. Human body responses are manifested through multiple modalities,\nsuch as the mechanical, electrical and chemical; yet current physiological\nmonitors (actigraphy, heart rate) largely lack in both the desired cross-modal\nand non-stigmatizing aspects. We address these challenges through an\ninconspicuous and comfortable earpiece, equipped with miniature multimodal\nsensors, which benefits from the relatively stable position of the ear canal\nwith respect to vital organs to robustly measure the brain, cardiac and\nrespiratory functions. Comprehensive experiments validate each modality within\nthe proposed earpiece, while its potential in health monitoring is illustrated\nthrough case studies. We further demonstrate how combining data from multiple\nsensors within such an integrated wearable device improves both the accuracy of\nmeasurements and the ability to deal with artifacts in real-life scenarios.\n", "  Thermodynamics of nanoscale devices is an active area of research. Despite\ntheir noisy surround- ing they often produce mechanical work (e.g. micro-heat\nengines) or display rectified Brownian motion (e.g. molecular motors). This\ninvokes the research in terms of experimentally quantifiable thermodynamic\nefficiencies. To enhance the efficiency of such devices, close-loop control is\nan useful technique. Here a single Brownian particle is driven by a harmonic\nconfinement with time-periodic contraction and expansion, together with a\nvelocity feedback that acts on the particle only when the trap contracts. Due\nto this feedback we are able to extract thermodynamic work out of the system\nhaving single heat bath without violating the Second Law of Thermodynamics. We\nanalyse the system using stochastic thermodynamics.\n", "  We investigate the applicability of laser assisted tunneling in a strongly\ninteracting one-dimensional Bose gas (the Tonks-Girardeau gas) in optical\nlattices. We find that the stroboscopic dynamics of the Tonks-Girardeau gas in\na continuous Wannier-Stark-ladder potential, supplemented with laser assisted\ntunneling, effectively realizes the ground state of one-dimensional hard-core\nbosons in a discrete lattice with nontrivial hopping phases. We compare\nobservables that are affected by the interactions, such as the momentum\ndistribution, natural orbitals and their occupancies, in the time-dependent\ncontinuous system, to those of the ground state of the discrete system.\nStroboscopically, we find an excellent agreement, indicating that laser\nassisted tunneling is a viable technique for realizing novel ground states and\nphases with hard-core one-dimensional Bose gases.\n", "  Gaia's Radial Velocity Spectrometer (RVS) has been operating in routine phase\nfor over one year since initial commissioning. RVS continues to work well but\nthe higher than expected levels of straylight reduce the limiting magnitude.\nThe end-of-mission radial-velocity (RV) performance requirement for G2V stars\nwas 15 km/s at V = 16.5 mag. Instead, 15 km/s precision is achieved at 15 < V <\n16 mag, consistent with simulations that predict a loss of 1.4 mag. Simulations\nalso suggest that changes to Gaia's onboard software could recover ~0.14 mag of\nthis loss. Consequently Gaia's onboard software was upgraded in April 2015. The\nstatus of this new commissioning period is presented, as well as the latest\nscientific performance of the on-ground processing of RVS spectra. We\nillustrate the implications of the RVS limiting magnitude on Gaia's view of the\nMilky Way's halo in 6D using the Gaia Universe Model Snapshot (GUMS).\n", "  We calculate Berry's phase when the driving field, to which a spin-1/2 is\ncoupled adiabatically, rather than the familiar classical magnetic field, is a\nquantum vector operator, of noncommuting, in general, components, e.g., the\nangular momentum of another particle, or another spin. The geometric phase of\nthe entire system, spin plus \"quantum driving field\", is first computed, and is\nthen subdivided into the two subsystems, using the Schmidt decomposition of the\ntotal wave function -the resulting expression shows a marked, purely quantum\neffect, involving the commutator of the field components. We also compute the\ncorresponding mean \"classical\" phase, involving a precessing magnetic field in\nthe presence of noise, up to terms quadratic in the noise amplitude -the\nresults are shown to be in excellent agreement with numerical simulations in\nthe literature. Subtleties in the relation between the quantum and classical\ncase are pointed out, while three concrete examples illustrate the scope and\ninternal consistency of our treatment.\n", "  Utilizing high-resolution cosmological hydrodynamic simulations we\ninvestigate various ultra-violet absorption lines in the circumgalactic medium\nof star forming galaxies at low redshift, in hopes of checking and alleviating\nthe claimed observational conundrum of the ratio of NV to OVI absorbers, among\nothers. We find a satisfactory agreement between simulations and extant\nobservational data with respect to the ratios of the following four line pairs\nexamined, NV/OVI, SiIV/OVI, NIII/OVI and NII/OVI. For the pairs involving\nnitrogen lines, we examine two cases of nitrogen abundance, one with constant\nN/O ratio and the other with varying N/O ratio, with the latter motivated by\ntheoretical considerations of two different synthetic sources of nitrogen that\nis empirically verified independently. Along a separate vector, for all line\npairs, we examine two cases of radiation field, one with the Haardt-Madau\nbackground radiation field and the other with an additional local radiation\nfield sourced by hot gas in the host galaxy. In all cases, two-sample\nKolmogorov-Smirnov tests indicate excellent agreements. We find that the\napparent agreements between simulations and observations will be strongly\ntested, if the bulk of current upper limits of various line ratios are turned\ninto actual detections. We show that an increase in observational sensitivity\nby 0.2 dex will already start to significantly constrain the models.\n", "  We present multi-telescope, ground-based, multiwavelength optical and\nnear-infrared photometry of the variable L3.5 ultra-cool dwarf 2MASSW\nJ0036159+182110. We present 22 nights of photometry of 2MASSW J0036159+182110,\nincluding 7 nights of simultaneous, multiwavelength photometry, spread over\n~120 days allowing us to determine the rotation period of this ultra-cool dwarf\nto be 3.080 +/- 0.001 hr. Our many nights of multiwavelength photometry allow\nus to observe the evolution, or more specifically the lack thereof, of the\nlight curve over a great many rotation periods. The lack of discernible phase\nshifts in our multiwavelength photometry, and that the amplitude of variability\ngenerally decreases as one moves to longer wavelengths for 2MASSW\nJ0036159+182110, is generally consistent with starspots driving the variability\non this ultra-cool dwarf, with starspots that are ~100 degrees K hotter or\ncooler than the ~1700 K photosphere. Also, reasonably thick clouds are required\nto fit the spectra of 2MASSW J0036159+182110, suggesting there likely exists\nsome complex interplay between the starspots driving the variability of this\nultra-cool dwarf and the clouds that appear to envelope this ultra-cool dwarf.\n", "  We present 17 nights of ground-based, near-infrared photometry of the\nvariable L/T transition brown dwarf SIMP J013656.5+093347 and an additional 3\nnights of ground-based photometry of the radio-active late M-dwarf TVLM\n513-46546. Our TVLM 513-46546 photometry includes 2 nights of simultaneous,\nmultiwavelength, ground-based photometry, in which we detect obvious J-band\nvariability, but do not detect I-band variability of similar amplitude,\nconfirming that the variability of TVLM 513-46546 most likely arises from\nclouds or aurorae, rather than starspots. Our photometry of SIMP\nJ013656.5+093347 includes 15 nights of J-band photometry that allow us to\nobserve how the variable light curve of this L/T transition brown dwarf evolves\nfrom rotation period to rotation period, night-to-night and week-to-week. We\nestimate the rotation period of SIMP J013656.5+093347 as 2.406 +/- 0.008 hours,\nand do not find evidence for obvious differential rotation. The peak-to-peak\namplitude displayed by SIMP J013656.5+093347 in our light curves evolves from\ngreater than 6% to less than 1% in a matter of days, and the typical timescale\nfor significant evolution of the SIMP J013656.5+093347 light curve appears to\nbe approximately <1 to 10 rotation periods. This suggests that those performing\nspectrophotometric observations of brown dwarfs should be cautious in their\ninterpretations comparing the spectra between a variable brown dwarf's maximum\nflux and minimum flux from observations lasting only approximately a rotation\nperiod, as these comparisons may depict the spectral characteristics of a\nsingle, ephemeral snapshot, rather than the full range of characteristics.\n", "  We report the electrical injection and detection of spin polarized current in\nlateral ferromagnet-nonmagnet-ferromagnet spin valve devices, ferromagnet being\ncobalt and nonmagnet being indium (In) or indium oxide (In2O3) nanostructures.\nThe In nanostructures were grown by depositing pure In on lithographically\npre-patterned structures. In2O3 nanostructures were obtained by oxidation of In\nnanostructures. Spin valve devices were fabricated by depositing micro magnets\nover the nanostructures with connecting nonmagnetic electrodes via two steps of\ne-beam lithography. Clear spin switching behavior was observed in the both\ntypes of spin valve devices measured at 10 K. From the measured spin signal,\nthe spin relaxation length ({\\lambda}N) of In and In2O3 nanostructures were\nestimated to be 449.6 nm and 788.6 nm respectively.\n", "  Diversity is a fundamental feature of ecosystems, even when the concept of\necosystem is extended to sociology or economics. Diversity can be intended as\nthe count of different items, animals, or, more generally, interactions. There\nare two classes of stylized facts that emerge when diversity is taken into\naccount. The first are Diversity explosions: evolutionary radiations in\nbiology, or the process of escaping 'Poverty Traps' in economics are two well\nknown examples. The second is nestedness: entities with a very diverse set of\ninteractions are the only ones that interact with more specialized ones. In a\nsingle sentence: specialists interact with generalists. Nestedness is observed\nin a variety of bipartite networks of interactions: Biogeographic,\nmacroeconomic and mutualistic to name a few. This indicates that entities\ndiversify following a pattern. Since they appear in such very different\nsystems, these two stylized facts point out that the build up of diversity is\ndriven by a fundamental probabilistic mechanism, and here we sketch its minimal\nfeatures. We show how the contraction of a random tripartite network, which is\nmaximally entropic in all its degree distributions but one, can reproduce\nstylized facts of real data with great accuracy which is qualitatively lost\nwhen that degree distribution is changed. We base our reasoning on the\ncombinatoric picture that the nodes on one layer of these bipartite networks\ncan be described as combinations of a number of fundamental building blocks.\nThe stylized facts of diversity that we observe in real systems can be\nexplained with an extreme heterogeneity (a scale-free distribution) in the\nnumber of meaningful combinations in which each building block is involved. We\nshow that if the usefulness of the building blocks has a scale-free\ndistribution, then maximally entropic baskets of building blocks will give rise\nto very rich behaviors.\n", "  This paper formulates, via the Mathisson - Papapetrou - Dixon equations, the\nsystem of equations for a test particle with spin when it is orbiting a weak\nKerr metric. We shall restrict ourselves to the case of circular orbits with\nthe purpose of comparing our results with the results of the literature. In\nparticular, we solve the set of equations of motion for the case of circular\ntrajectories both spinless and spinning test particles around rotating bodies\nin equatorial plane. The results obtained are an important guideline for the\nstudy of the effects of the particles with spin in rotating gravitational\nfields such as Gravitomagnetics Effects or gravitational waves.\n", "  Natures of progenitors of type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) have not yet been\nclarified. There has been long and intensive discussion on whether the\nso-called single degenerate (SD) scenario or the double degenerate (DD)\nscenario, or anything else, could explain a major population of SNe Ia, but the\nconclusion has not yet been reached. With rapidly increasing observational data\nand new theoretical ideas, the field of studying the SN Ia progenitors has been\nquickly developing, and various new insights have been obtained in recent\nyears. This article aims at providing a summary of the current situation\nregarding the SN Ia progenitors, both in theory and observations. It seems\ndifficult to explain the emerging diversity seen in observations of SNe Ia by a\nsingle population, and we emphasize that it is important to clarify links\nbetween different progenitor scenarios and different sub-classes of SNe Ia.\n", "  A study has been conducted into the mechanisms of evolution of clusters and\ntheir subsequent fragmentation under energetic heavy ion bombardment of\namorphous graphite. The evolving clusters and their subsequent fragmentation\nunder continuing ion bombardment are revealed by detecting various clusters in\nthe energy spectra of the Direct Recoils emitted as a result of collisions\nbetween ions and surface constituents. The successive Direct Recoil spectra\nreveal that the energetics of Carbon Carbon bond formation as well as any\nsubsequent fragmentation can be related to the processes of energy dissipation\nin a cylindrical volume of a few Angstrom surrounding the ion path. The\ndependence of cluster with m carbon atoms formation or its subsequent\nfragmentation into cluster with m-2 carbon atoms and diatomic carbon C2 is seen\nto be a function of the ionic stopping powers in this cylindrical volume.\n", "  Unification of matter fields implies the existence of accidental permutation\nsymmetries, which potentially remain immune to large quantum corrections up to\nthe TeV scale. We investigate the case of a supersymmetric $SU(5)$ grand\nunified theory, where such a permutation symmetry is present in the up-type\nsquark sector. We present a variety of tests allowing to challenge the $SU(5)$\nhypothesis based on the observation of squarks at the LHC. These tests appear\nas relations among observables involving flavour-violating or\nchirality-flipping decays of squarks. Moreover, they rely on top-polarimetry\nand charm-tagging. As an example, we discuss the application to the scenario of\nNatural Supersymmetry, while more examples can be found in the related journal\npublications.\n", "  Radio frequency deflectors are widely used for time-resolved electron beam\nenergy, emittance and radiation profile measurements in modern free electron\nlaser facilities. In this paper, we present the beam dynamics aspects of the\ndeflecting cavity of SXFEL user facility, which is located at the exit of the\nundulator. With a targeted time resolution around 10 fs, it is expected to be\nan important tool for time-resolved commissioning and machine studies for SXFEL\nuser facility.\n", "  An analysis is presented of the expectations of the thermal model for\nparticle production in collisions of small nuclei. The maxima observed in\nparticle ratios of strange particles to pions as a function of beam energy in\nheavy ion collisions, are reduced when considering smaller nuclei. Of\nparticular interest is the $\\Lambda/\\pi^+$ ratio shows the strongest maximum\nwhich survives even in collisions of small nuclei.\n", "  We examine the efficiency of an effective two-terminal thermoelectric device\nunder broken time-reversal symmetry. The setup is derived from a three-terminal\nthermoelectric device comprising a thermal terminal and two electronic\ncontacts, under a magnetic field. We find that breaking time-reversal symmetry\nin the presence of the inelastic electron-phonon processes can significantly\nenhance the figure of merit for delivering electric power by supplying heat\nfrom a phonon bath, beyond the one for producing the electric power by\ninvesting thermal power from the electronic heat current. The efficiency of\nsuch a device is bounded by the non-negativity of the entropy production of the\noriginal three-terminal junction. The efficiency at maximal power can be quite\nclose to the Carnot efficiency, but then the electric power vanishes.\n", "  The production of electroweak bosons ($Z,\\gamma$ and $W$) and charmonia is\nsensitive to the initial-state geometry of heavy-ion collisions and to the\nparton distribution function with its potential nuclear modification. Since\ntheir leptonic decay products do not interact strongly, their kinematics are\nunmodified by the strongly interacting medium, which can be created in a\nheavy-ion collision. We report on the latest results of the ATLAS Collaboration\non electroweak boson and charmonia production in $p$+Pb collisions at\n$\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}} = 5.02$ TeV. Production yields of $Z$ and $W$ bosons are\npresented as a function of (pseudo-)rapidity in different centrality bins. The\nforward-backward ratio of J/$\\psi$ is shown as a function of transverse\nmomentum and center-of-mass rapidity.\n", "  Shortcuts to adiabaticity are alternative fast processes that reproduce the\nsame final populations, or even the same final state, as the adiabatic process\nin a finite, shorter time. Many of the existing approaches to design shortcuts,\nand even new ones have been used throughout this Thesis in the double well\npotential. These techniques have allowed us to obtain a great benefit in\nprocesses as varied as matter-wave splitting, multiplexing/ demultiplexing,\nbeam splitters, cotunneling, population inversion, waveguide optimization,\nTonks-Girardeau gas manipulation and bias inversion.\n", "  Understanding the collective dynamics of crowd movements during stressful\nemergency situations is central to reducing the risk of deadly crowd disasters.\nYet, their systematic experimental study remains a challenging open problem due\nto ethical and methodological constraints. In this paper, we demonstrate the\nviability of shared 3D virtual environments as an experimental platform for\nconducting crowd experiments with real people. In particular, we show that\ncrowds of real human subjects moving and interacting in an immersive 3D virtual\nenvironment exhibit typical patterns of real crowds as observed in real-life\ncrowded situations. These include the manifestation of social conventions and\nthe emergence of self-organized patterns during egress scenarios. High-stress\nevacuation experiments conducted in this virtual environment reveal movements\ncharacterized by mass herding and dangerous overcrowding as they occur in crowd\ndisasters. We describe the behavioral mechanisms at play under such extreme\nconditions and identify critical zones where overcrowding may occur.\nFurthermore, we show that herding spontaneously emerges from a density effect\nwithout the need to assume an increase of the individual tendency to imitate\npeers. Our experiments reveal the promise of immersive virtual environments as\nan ethical, cost-efficient, yet accurate platform for exploring crowd behaviour\nin high-risk situations with real human subjects.\n", "  Air-ionization chambers have been used in radiotherapy and particle therapy\nfor decades. However, fundamental parameters in action in the detector\nresponses are sparsely studied. In this work we aimed to measure the electronic\nattachment, electrons and ions mobilities of an ionization chamber (IC) in air.\nThe main idea is to extract these from the actual response of the IC to a\nsingle ionizing particle in order to insure that they were measured in the same\ncondition they are to be used while neglecting undesired phenomena:\nrecombination and space charge effect. The non-standard signal shape analysis\nperformed here were also confronted to a more standard drift chamber\nmeasurements using time-of-flight. It was found that both detectors displayed\ncompatible results concerning positive and negative ions drift velocities where\nliterature data is well spread out. In the same time, electron attachment\nmeasurements sit in the middle of known measurements while electron drift\nvelocities seemed to show an offset compared to the well known and modeled\ndata.\n", "  In this paper, we present results from an experimental study into turbulent\nRayleigh-Benard convection forced externally by periodically modulated\nunidirectional rotation rates. We find that the azimuthal rotation velocity\n$\\dot{\\theta}$(t) and thermal amplitude $\\delta$(t) of the large-scale\ncirculation (LSC) are modulated by the forcing, exhibiting a variety of\ndynamics including increasing phase delays and a resonant peak in the amplitude\nof $\\dot{\\theta}$(t). We also focus on the influence of modulated rotation\nrates on the frequency of occurrence $\\eta$ of stochastic\ncessation/reorientation events, and on the interplay between such events and\nthe periodically modulated response of $\\dot{\\theta}$(t). Here we identify a\nmechanism by which $\\eta$ can be amplfied by the modulated response and these\nnormally stochastic events can occur with high regularity. We provide a\nmodeling framework that explains the observed amplitude and phase responses,\nand extend this approach to make predictions for the occurrence of cessation\nevents and the probability distributions of $\\dot{\\theta}$(t) and $\\delta$(t)\nduring different phases of a modulation cycle, based on an adiabatic approach\nthat treats each phase separately. Lastly, we show that such periodic forcing\nhas consequences beyond influencing LSC dynamics, by investigating how it can\nmodify the heat transport even under conditions where the Ekman pumping effect\nis predominant and strong enhancement of heat transport occurs. We identify\nphase and amplitude responses of the heat transport, and show how increased\nmodulations influence the average Nusselt number.\n", "  Two-level systems are one of the most important quantum systems and they form\nthe basis of quantum computers. We briefly look at the traditional approach to\ntwo-level systems with an external driving field as well as those subjected to\nnoise. This project is aimed at studying two specific methods for obtaining\nanalytic solutions for two-level systems. One of the methods enables us to\nobtain analytic solutions for driven time-dependent two-level systems while the\nother attempts to give exact solution of qubit decoherence using a transfer\nmatrix method. A thorough study of both papers is done and results are\nreproduced. The latter method is generalized for a qutrit system as well as a\ntwo qubit system subjected to noise. A general method is formally derived for\nan N-dimensional quantum system and the difficulties in applying the method in\nreal life systems is discussed.\n", "  The equation of motion of a quantized vortex filament in a trapped\nBose-Einstein condensate [A. A. Svidzinsky and A. L. Fetter, Phys. Rev. A {\\bf\n62}, 063617 (2000)] has been generalized to the case of an arbitrary anharmonic\nanisotropic rotating trap and presented in a variational form. For condensate\ndensity profiles of the form $\\rho=f(x^2+y^2+\\mbox{Re\\,}\\Psi(x+iy))$ in the\npresence of the plane of symmetry $y=0$, the solutions $x(z)$ describing\nstationary vortices of U and S types coming to the surface and solitary waves\nhave been found in quadratures. Analogous three-dimensional configurations of\nthe vortex filament uniformly moving along the $z$ axis have also been found in\nstrictly cylindrical geometry. The dependence of solutions on the form of the\nfunction $f(q)$ has been analyzed.\n", "  We consider a single impurity Anderson model (SIAM) in which the quantum\ndot(QD) is strongly coupled to a phonon bath in polaron regime. This coupling\nresults in an effective e-e attraction. By computing the self energies using a\ncurrent conserving approximation which is up to second order in this effective\nattraction, we show that if the interaction is strong enough, in non\nparticle-hole(PH) symmetric case, the system would be bi-stable and we have\nhysteresis loop in the I-V characteristic. Moreover, the system shows negative\ndifferential conductance in some bias voltage intervals.\n", "  The present state of the art axion haloscope employs a cylindrical resonant\ncavity in a solenoidal field. We, the Center for Axion and Precision Physics\nResearch (CAPP) of the Institute for Basic Science (IBS) in Korea, are also\npursuing halo axion discovery using this cylindrical geometry. However, the\npresence of end caps of cavities increases challenges as we explore higher\nfrequency regions for the axion at above 2 GHz. To overcome these challenges we\nexploit a toroidal design of cavity and magnetic field. A toroidal geometry\noffers several advantages, two of which are a larger volume for a given space\nand greatly reduced fringe fields which interfere with our preamps, in\nparticular the planned quantum-based devices. We introduce the concept of\ntoroidal axion haloscopes and present ongoing research activities and plans at\nCAPP/IBS.\n", "  The mean completion time of a stochastic process may be rendered finite and\nminimised by a judiciously chosen restart protocol, which may either be\nstochastic or deterministic. Here we study analytically an arbitrary stochastic\nsearch subject to an arbitrary restart protocol, each characterised by a\ndistribution of waiting times. By a direct enumeration of paths we construct\nthe joint distribution of completion time and restart number, in a form\namenable to analytical evaluation or quadrature; thereby we optimise the search\nover both time and potentially costly restart events. Analysing the effect of a\npunctual, i.e. almost deterministic, restart, we demonstrate that the optimal\ncompletion time always increases proportionately with the variance of the\nrestart distribution; the constant of proportionality depends only on the\nsearch process. We go on to establish simple bounds on the optimal restart\ntime. Our results are relevant to the analysis and rational design of efficient\nand optimal restart protocols.\n", "  Athena is the large mission selected by ESA in 2013 to investigate the\nscience theme \"Hot and Energetic Universe\" and presently scheduled for launch\nin 2028. One of the two instruments located at the focus of the 12 m-long\nAthena telescope is the X-ray Integral Field Unit (X-IFU). This is an array of\nTES micro-calorimeters that will be operated at temperatures of 50 mK in order\nto perform high resolution spectroscopy with an energy resolution down to 2.5\neV at energies < 7 keV. In order to cope with the large dynamical range of\nX-ray fluxes spanned by the celestial objects Athena will be observing, the\nX-IFU will be equipped with a filter wheel. This will allow the user to fine\ntune the instrument set-up based on the nature of the target, thus optimizing\nthe scientific outcomes of the observation. A few positions of the filter wheel\nwill also be used to host a calibration source and to allow the measurement of\nthe instrument intrinsic background.\n", "  In 2013, Boneh and Zhandry introduced the notion of indistinguishability\n(IND) in chosen plaintext (CPA) and chosen ciphertext (CCA) attacks by a\nquantum adversary which is given superposition access to an oracle for\nencryption and decryption queries but is restricted to classical queries in the\nchallenge phase. In this paper we define IND-CPA and IND-CCA notions for\nsymmetric encryption schemes where the adversary has full quantum superposition\naccess to the oracle, and give constructions that achieve these security\nnotions. Our results are formulated in the concrete security framework.\n", "  Soon to be operational HI survey instruments such as APERTIF and ASKAP will\nproduce large datasets. These surveys will provide information about the HI in\nand around hundreds of galaxies with a typical signal-to-noise ratio of $\\sim$\n10 in the inner regions and $\\sim$ 1 in the outer regions. In addition, such\nsurveys will make it possible to probe faint HI structures, typically located\nin the vicinity of galaxies, such as extra-planar-gas, tails and filaments.\nThese structures are crucial for understanding galaxy evolution, particularly\nwhen they are studied in relation to the local environment. Our aim is to find\noptimized kernels for the discovery of faint and morphologically complex HI\nstructures. Therefore, using HI data from a variety of galaxies, we explore\nstate-of-the-art filtering algorithms. We show that the intensity-driven\ngradient filter, due to its adaptive characteristics, is the optimal choice. In\nfact, this filter requires only minimal tuning of the input parameters to\nenhance the signal-to-noise ratio of faint components. In addition, it does not\ndegrade the resolution of the high signal-to-noise component of a source. The\nfiltering process must be fast and be embedded in an interactive visualization\ntool in order to support fast inspection of a large number of sources. To\nachieve such interactive exploration, we implemented a multi-core CPU (OpenMP)\nand a GPU (OpenGL) version of this filter in a 3D visualization environment\n($\\tt{SlicerAstro}$).\n", "  The COBRA collaboration investigates 0{\\nu}\\beta\\beta-decays (neutrinoless\ndouble beta-decays). Therefore, a demonstrator setup using coplanar-grid CdZnTe\ndetectors is operated at the LNGS underground laboratory. In this work, the\ndemonstrator was commissioned and completed, which is discussed extensively.\nThe demonstrator works reliably and collects low-background physics data. One\nresult of the analysis of the data is that surface events are the dominating\nbackground component. To better understand and possibly discriminate this\nbackground, surface events were studied in detail. This was done mainly using\nlaboratory measurements. For a better interpretation of these measurements,\nsimulations of particle trajectories and ranges were done. The surface\nsensitivity tests showed large differences between the individual detectors.\nOften, a dead-layer was determined, especially at the surfaces where the\nnon-collecting anode (NCA) is the outermost anode rail. Due to this, the\nsensitivity of the surfaces where the collecting anode (CA) is adjacent was\ntypically about a factor of three larger than the NCA sensitivity. A comparison\nof the pulse shape analysis methods LSE and A/E was done. Laboratory\nmeasurements indicate, that the latter performs better. Alpha scanning\nmeasurements were done to spatially investigate the surface sensitivity.\nPlausible variations were measured. However, no hints were found how to improve\nthe surface event recognition. The instrumentation of the guard ring, which\nsurrounds the anode structure, was tested and improved the surface event\ndiscrimination significantly. The fraction of surviving alpha events was at a\nper-mill level. Important steps for a future large-scale COBRA experiment are\ndiscussed briefly, mainly the use of an integrated read-out system. Overall,\nthe results indicate a large potential in background reduction for the COBRA\nexperiment.\n", "  Magnetic properties of a ferronematic, i.e., nematic liquid crystal doped\nwith magnetic nanoparticles in low volume concentration are studied, with the\nfocus on the ac magnetic susceptibility. A weak dc bias magnetic field (units\nof Oe) applied to the ferronematic in its isotropic phase increases the ac\nmagnetic susceptibility considerably. Passage of the isotropic-to-nematic phase\ntransition resets this enhancement irreversibly (unless the dc bias field is\napplied again in the isotropic phase). These experimental findings pave a way\nto application possibilities, such as low magnetic field sensors, or basic\nlogical elements for information storage.\n", "  Supernova Remnant RX J1713.7-3946 emits synchrotron X-rays and very high\nenergy $\\gamma$-rays. Recently, thermal X-ray line emission is detected from\nejecta plasma. CO and HI observations indicate that a highly inhomogeneous\nmedium surrounding the SNR. It is interacting with dense molecular clouds in\nthe northwest and the southwest of the remnant. The origin of the $\\gamma$-ray\nemission from RX J1713.7-3946 is still uncertain. Detection of rapid\nvariability in X-ray emission from RX J1713.7-3946 indicates the magnetic field\n$B$ $\\sim$ mG. In this work, we investigate the time variation in X-ray flux,\nluminosity and photon index of RX J1713.7-3946. For this investigation, we\nstudy the northwest part of the remnant using Suzaku data in 2006 and 2010. We\npresent preliminary results based on our analysis and interpretations about\nthese X-ray time variability.\n", "  The aim of this paper is to develop and test metrics to quantitatively\nidentify technological discontinuities in a knowledge network. We developed\nfive metrics based on innovation theories and tested the metrics by a\nsimulation model-based knowledge network and hypothetically designed\ndiscontinuity. The designed discontinuity is modeled as a node which combines\ntwo different knowledge streams and whose knowledge is dominantly persistent in\nthe knowledge network. The performances of the proposed metrics were evaluated\nby how well the metrics can distinguish the designed discontinuity from other\nnodes on the knowledge network. The simulation results show that the\npersistence times # of converging main paths provides the best performance in\nidentifying the designed discontinuity: the designed discontinuity was\nidentified as one of the top 3 patents with 96~99% probability by Metric 5 and\nit is, according to the size of a domain, 12~34% better than the performance of\nthe second best metric. Beyond the simulation analysis, we tested the metrics\nusing a patent set representative of the Magnetic information storage domain.\nThe three representative patents associated with a well-known breakthrough\ntechnology in the domain, the giant magneto-resistance (GMR) spin valve sensor,\nwere selected based on the qualitative studies, and the metrics were tested by\nhow well the metrics identify the selected patents as top-ranked patents. The\nempirical results fully support the simulation results and therefore the\npersistence times # of converging main paths is recommended for identifying\ntechnological discontinuities for any technology.\n", "  Any space-filling packing of spheres can be cut by a plane to obtain a\nspace-filling packing of disks. Here, we deal with space-filling packings\ngenerated using inversive geometry leading to exactly self-similar fractal\npackings. First, we prove that cutting along a random hyperplane leads in\ngeneral to a packing with a fractal dimension of the one of the uncut packing\nminus one. Second, we find special cuts which can be constructed themselves by\ninversive geometry. Such special cuts have specific fractal dimensions, which\nwe demonstrate by cutting a three- and a four-dimensional packing. The increase\nin the number of found special cuts with respect to a cutoff parameter suggests\nthe existence of infinitely many topologies with distinct fractal dimensions.\n", "  Production of prompt isolated photons at hadron colliders provides a probe of\nperturbative QCD and can be used to study the gluon density function of the\nproton. The ATLAS collaboration has performed precise measurements of the\ninclusive production of isolated prompt photons in 20.2 fb${}^{-1}$ of data\ncollected at $\\sqrt{s}=8$ TeV and in 6.4 pb${}^{-1}$ of data collected at\n$\\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV. The measurements are compared with state-of-the-art theory\npredictions at NLO in QCD and with predictions of several MC generators.\nProduction of inclusive jets at hadron colliders also provides a probe of\nperturbative QCD. The inclusive jet production cross-section was measured in 78\npb${}^{-1}$ of data collected at $\\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV. Results have been compared\nwith (state-of-the-art) theory predictions at NLO in QCD, interfaced with\ndifferent parton distribution functions.\n", "  The Cellular Potts Model (CPM) is a lattice based modeling technique which is\nwidely used for simulating cellular patterns such as foams or biological\ntissues. Despite its realism and generality, the standard Monte Carlo algorithm\nused in the scientific literature to evolve this model preserves connectivity\nof cells on a limited range of simulation temperature only. We present a new\nalgorithm in which cell fragmentation is forbidden for all simulation\ntemperatures. This allows to significantly enhance realism of the simulated\npatterns. It also increases the computational efficiency compared with the\nstandard CPM algorithm even at same simulation temperature, thanks to the time\nspared in not doing unrealistic moves. Moreover, our algorithm restores the\ndetailed balance equation, ensuring that the long-term stage is independent of\nthe chosen acceptance rate and chosen path in the temperature space.\n", "  Results on the production of $\\pi^{\\pm}$, $\\textrm{K}^{\\pm}$,\n$\\textrm{p}(\\bar{\\textrm{p}})$, $\\Lambda(\\bar{\\Lambda})$, $\\Xi^{-}\n\\left(\\bar{\\Xi}^{+}\\right)$ and $\\Omega^{-} \\left(\\bar{\\Omega}^{+}\\right)$ at\nmidrapidity (${|y|<0.5}$) as a function of multiplicity in\n$\\sqrt{s}~=~7~\\textrm{TeV}$ pp collisions are reported. Transverse momentum\ndistributions and integrated yields are compared to expectations from\nstatistical hadronization models along with results from different colliding\nsystems and center-of-mass energies. The evolution of spectral shapes with\nmultiplicity show similar patterns to those seen in p-Pb and Pb-Pb collisions.\nThe $p_{\\textrm{T}}$-integrated baryon yields relative to pions exhibit a\nsignificant strangeness-related enhancement in both pp and p-Pb collisions.\n", "  We present an extensive experimental study focused on understanding the\nimpact of cavitation in a high-pressure diesel nozzle on the macroscopic\nproperties of fuel spray. Several high-speed videos of the liquid flow through\na transparent, asymmetric cylindrical nozzle with a single orifice (phi = 0.35\nmm) are recorded along with the videos of the resulting spray in the\nnear-nozzle region, issued with an injection pressure of 300 bar at a\nframe-rate of 75 kHz. The high-repetition images of the internal flow are then\nused to estimate the onset of cavitation inside the transparent nozzle and the\nprobability of development of cavitation in different regions of the nozzle\nwith an average estimate of the amount of cavitation with time. On the other\nhand, recorded spray images are used to study spray penetration, cone-angles\nand velocity from the start of fuel injection. A novel approach is proposed for\nthe measurement of perturbations that occur in form of big liquid structures\nalong the spray boundary.\n", "  Polar catastrophe at the interface of oxide materials with strongly\ncorrelated electrons has triggered a flurry of new research activities. The\nexpectations are that the design of such advanced interfaces will become a\npowerful route to engineer devices with novel functionalities. Here we\ninvestigate the initial stages of growth and the electronic structure of the\nspintronic Fe3O4/MgO (001) interface. Using soft x-ray absorption spectroscopy\nwe have discovered that the so-called A-sites are completely missing in the\nfirst Fe3O4 monolayer. This allows us to develop an unexpected but elegant\ngrowth principle in which during deposition the Fe atoms are constantly on the\nmove to solve the divergent electrostatic potential problem, thereby ensuring\nepitaxy and stoichiometry at the same time. This growth principle provides a\nnew perspective for the design of interfaces.\n", "  V616 Mon = A0620-00 is a prototype of black hole transient X-ray binaries.\nOur 2003-16 optical photometry of the object during X-ray quiescence, obtained\nby 50-250 cm telescopes in Crimea, Caucasus Mountains and Slovakia, consists of\n~ 7660 CCD frames in Johnson-Cousins $V,R,R_C,I$ bands and the integral light.\nDuring 2003, 2008-9 and 2015-16 passive states, the phase light curve of the\nbinary exhibited mainly variations caused by an ellipsoidal shape of the red\ndwarf component. During 2004-6 and 2009-14 active states a significant\naperiodic broad-band variability (flickering) was present, arising in a black\nhole accretion disk and a bright spot, where the mass transfer stream hits the\nouter edge of the disk. Long term photometry of our minima times, together with\navailable positions of superior conjunctions of the red dwarf found from\nspectroscopy, allowed us to refine the orbital period of V616 Mon to\n0.32301407(5) days.\n", "  Three dimensional simulations on the viscous folding in diverging\nmicrochannels reported by Cubaud and Mason are performed using the parallel\ncode BLUE for multi-phase flows. The more viscous liquid L_1 is injected into\nthe channel from the center inlet, and the less viscous liquid L_2 from two\nside inlets. Liquid L_1 takes the form of a thin filament due to hydrodynamic\nfocusing in the long channel that leads to the diverging region. The thread\nthen becomes unstable to a folding instability, due to the longitudinal\ncompressive stress applied to it by the diverging flow of liquid L_2. Given the\nlong computation time, we were limited to a parameter study comprising five\nsimulations in which the flow rate ratio, the viscosity ratio, the Reynolds\nnumber, and the shape of the channel were varied relative to a reference model.\nIn our simulations, the cross section of the thread produced by focusing is\nelliptical rather than circular. The initial folding axis can be either\nparallel or perpendicular to the narrow dimension of the chamber. In the former\ncase, the folding slowly transforms via twisting to perpendicular folding, or\nit may remain parallel. The direction of folding onset is determined by the\nvelocity profile and the elliptical shape of the thread cross section in the\nchannel that feeds the diverging part of the cell. Due to the high viscosity\ncontrast and very low Reynolds numbers, direct numerical simulations of this\ntwo-phase flow are very challenging and to our knowledge these are the first\nthree-dimensional direct parallel numerical simulations of viscous threads in\nmicrochannels. Our simulations provide good qualitative comparison of the early\ntime onset of the folding instability however since the computational time for\nthese simulations is quite long, for such viscous threads, long-time\ncomparisons with experiments for quantities such as folding frequency are\nlimited.\n", "  Supernova Remnants (SNRs) exhibit spectra featured by synchrotron radio\nemission arising from the relativistic electrons, and high-energy emission from\nboth leptonic (Bremsstrahlung and Inverse Compton) and hadronic processes\n(${\\pi}^0$ mesons decay) which are a direct signature of cosmic rays\nacceleration. Thanks to radio single-dish imaging observations obtained in\nthree frequency bands (1.6, 7, 22 GHz) with the Sardinia Radio Telescope\n(www.srt.inaf.it), we can model different SNR regions separately. Indeed, in\norder to disentangle interesting and peculiar hadron contributions in the\nhigh-energy spectra (gamma-ray band) and better constrain SNRs as cosmic rays\nemitters, it is crucial to fully constrain lepton contributions first through\nradio-observed parameters. In particular, the Bremsstrahlung and Inverse\nCompton bumps observed in gamma-rays are bounded to synchrotron spectral slope\nand cut-off in the radio domain. Since these parameters vary for different SNR\nregions and electron populations, spatially-resolved radio spectra are then\nrequired for accurate multi-wavelength modelling.\n", "  Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction has been proven to excite entanglement\nof spin systems, enhancing the capability of realizing various quantum tasks\nsuch as teleportation. In this work, we consider the DM interaction -to the\nbest of our knowledge, for the first time in quantum game theory. We study the\nwinning probability of magic square game played with the thermal entangled\nstate of spin models under external magnetic fields and DM interaction. We\nanalytically show that although DM interaction excites the entanglement of the\nsystem as expected, it surprizingly reduces the winning probability of the\ngame, acting like temperature or magnetic fields, and also show that the\neffects of DM interaction and inhomogeneous magnetic field on the winning\nprobability are identical. In addition, we show that XXZ model is considerably\nmore robust than XX model against destructive effects. Our results can open new\ninsights for quantum information processing with spin systems.\n", "  In the frame of the Astronomical Validation activities for the 64m Sardinia\nRadio Telescope, we performed 5-22 GHz imaging observations of the\ncomplex-morphology supernova remnants (SNRs) W44 and IC443. We adopted\ninnovative observing and mapping techniques providing unprecedented accuracy\nfor single-dish imaging of SNRs at these frequencies, revealing morphological\ndetails typically available only at lower frequencies through interferometry\nobservations. High-frequency studies of SNRs in the radio range are useful to\nbetter characterize the spatially-resolved spectra and the physical parameters\nof different regions of the SNRs interacting with the ISM. Furthermore,\nsynchrotron-emitting electrons in the high-frequency radio band are also\nresponsible for the observed high-energy phenomenology as -e.g.- Inverse\nCompton and bremsstrahlung emission components observed in gamma-rays, to be\ndisentangled from hadron emission contribution (providing constraints on the\norigin of cosmic rays).\n", "  In this work I review the observational constraints imposed on the energetics\nand magnetisation of quasar jets, in the context of theoretical expectations.\nThe discussion is focused on issues regarding the jet production efficiency,\nmatter content, and particle acceleration. I show that if the ratio of\nelectron-positron-pairs to protons is of order $15$, as is required to achieve\nagreement between jet powers computed using blazar spectral fits and those\ncomputed using radio-lobe calorimetry, the magnetization of blazar jets in\nflat-spectrum-radio-quasars (FSRQ) must be significant. This result favors the\nreconnection mechanism for particle acceleration and explains the large\nCompton-dominance of blazar spectra that is often observed, without the need to\npostulate very low jet magnetization.\n", "  While being optimally compensated for spatial phase variations, the\ntwo-photon state produced by the two-crystal emission exhibits spatial and\nspectral decoherence off the central emission modes. In this paper, we present\nan experimentally convenient method to optimize the ultra-wide spatial and\nspectral windows; allowing the minimum spatial-spectral decoherence for a\nrequired two-photon flux.\n", "  We map the Hi distribution of galaxies in a $\\sim 1.5^\\circ \\times 2.5^\\circ$\nregion located at the virial radius south of the Virgo cluster using the\nKAT$-$7 and the WSRT interferometers. Because of the different beam sizes of\nthe two telescopes, a similar column density sensitivity of $\\rm N_{Hi} \\sim\n10^{18}\\,cm^{-2}$ was reached with the two observations over 16.5 km/s. We\npioneer a new approach to combine the observations and take advantage of their\nsensitivity to both the large and small scale structures. Out to an\nunprecedented extent, we detect an Hi tail of $\\sim 60$ kpc being stripped off\nNGC 4424, a peculiar spiral galaxy. The properties of the galaxy, together with\nthe shape of the tail, suggest that NGC 4424 is a post-merger galaxy undergoing\na ram pressure stripping as it falls towards the centre of the Virgo Cluster.\nWe detect a total of 14 galaxies and 3 Hi clouds lacking optical counterparts.\nOne of the clouds is a new detection with an Hi mass of $\\rm 7\\times10^7\\,\nM_\\odot$ and a strong Hi profile with $W_{50} = 73$ km/s. We find that 10 out\nof the 14 galaxies present Hi deficiencies not higher than those of the\ncluster's late spirals, suggesting that the environmental effects are not more\npronounced in the region than elsewhere in the cluster.\n", "  Observational evidence suggests that some very large supermassive black holes\n(SMBHs) already existed less than 1 Gyr after the Big Bang. Explaining the\nformation and growth of the 'seeds' of these SMBHs is quite challenging. We\nexplore the formation of such seeds in the direct collapse scenario. Using 3D\nhydrodynamical simulations, we investigate the impact of turbulence and\nrotation on the fragmentation behavior of collapsing primordial gas in the\npresence of a strong UV radiation background, which keeps the gas hot.\nAdditionally, we explore different ways in which the collapsing gas may be able\nto stay hot, and thus limit fragmentation. Using a one-zone model, we examine\nthe interplay between magnetic fields, turbulence, and a UV radiation\nbackground.\n  Feedback processes from stars and black holes shape the interstellar medium\n(ISM) out of which new generations of luminous objects form. To understand the\nproperties of these objects, e.g. the stellar initial mass function, it is\nvital to have knowledge of the chemical and thermodynamical properties of the\nfeedback-regulated ISM. To better understand the chemo-thermal state and\nfragmentation behavior of gas in high-redshift galaxies, we updated, improved,\nand extended a photodissociation region code. Our computational code, PDR-Zz,\nis described in detail. Using this code, a grid of models is run, covering a\nsizable range in physical properties. This allows us to systematically explore\nthe overall impact of various feedback effects, both radiative and chemical, on\nthe chemical and thermal balance of the gas in different physical regimes.\n", "  The possibility of using plasma wakefield acceleration to build a very high\nenergy electron-proton (VHEeP) collider at a centre-of-mass energy of 9 TeV was\npresented at the DIS2015 workshop. In this talk, the physics case was further\ndeveloped and the idea has since been published as a journal paper. A brief\nsummary is here given along with some details of the technical aspects not\ncovered in the paper, which focused on the physics motivation. It is\ndemonstrated that an $ep$ collider with a centre-of-mass energy a factor of 30\nabove HERA has sensitivity to new physical phenomena.\n", "  Point defects in silicon carbide are rapidly becoming a platform of great\ninterest for single photon generation, quantum sensing, and quantum information\nscience. Photonic crystal cavities (PCC) can serve as an efficient light-matter\ninterface both to augment the defect emission and to aid in studying the\ndefects' properties. In this work, we fabricate 1D nanobeam PCCs in 4H-silicon\ncarbide with embedded silicon vacancy centers. These cavities are used to\nachieve Purcell enhancement of two closely spaced defect zero-phonon lines\n(ZPL). Enhancements of >80-fold are measured using multiple techniques.\nAdditionally, the nature of the cavity coupling to the different ZPLs is\nexamined.\n", "  The elastic constants of hcp $^{4}$He are computed using the path-integral\nMonte Carlo (PIMC) method. The stiffness coefficients are obtained by imposing\ndifferent distortions to a periodic cell containing 180 atoms, followed by\nmeasurement of the elements of the corresponding stress tensor. For this\npurpose an appropriate path-integral expression for the stress tensor\nobservable is derived and implemented into the PIMC++ package. In addition to\nallowing the determination of the elastic stiffness constants, this development\nalso opens the way to an explicit atomistic determination of the Peierls stress\nfor dislocation motion using the PIMC technique. A comparison of the results to\navailable experimental data shows an overall good agreement of the density\ndependence of the elastic constants, with the single exception of C$_{13}$.\nAdditional calculations for the bcc phase, on the other hand, show good\nagreement for \\textit{all} elastic constants.\n", "  [Shortened abstract:] In this thesis we investigate a solution to the\n`problem of time' in canonical quantum gravity by splitting spacetime into\nsurfaces of constant mean curvature parameterised by York time. We argue that\nthere are reasons to consider York time a viable candidate for a physically\nmeaningful notion of time. We investigate a number York-time\nHamiltonian-reduced cosmological models and explore some technical aspects,\nsuch as the non-canonical Poisson structure. We develop York-time\nHamiltonian-reduced cosmological perturbation theory by solving the Hamiltonian\nconstraint perturbatively around a homogeneous background for the physical\n(non-vanishing) Hamiltonian that is the momentum conjugate to the York time\nparameter. We proceed to canonically quantise the cosmological models and the\nperturbation theory and discuss a number of conceptual and technical points,\nsuch as volume eigenfunctions and the absence of a momentum representation due\nto the non-standard commutator structure. We propose an alternative,\nwavefunction-free method of quantisation based on an ensemble of trajectories\nand a dynamical configuration-space geometry and discuss its application to\ngravity. We conclude by placing the York-time theories explored in this thesis\nin the wider context of a search for a satisfactory theory of quantum gravity.\n", "  Humans face the task of balancing dynamic systems near an unstable\nequilibrium repeatedly throughout their lives. Much research has been aimed at\nunderstanding the mechanisms of intermittent control in the context of human\nbalance control. The present paper deals with one of the recent developments in\nthe theory of human intermittent control, namely, the double-well model of\nnoise-driven control activation. We demonstrate that the double-well model can\nreproduce the whole range of experimentally observed distributions under\ndifferent conditions. Moreover, we show that a slight change in the noise\nintensity parameter leads to a sudden shift of the action point distribution\nshape, that is, a phase transition is observed.\n", "  We present transport spectroscopy of sub-gap states in a bottom gated InAs\nnanowire coupled to a normal lead and a superconducting aluminium lead. The\ndevice shows clearly resolved sub-gap states which we can track as the coupling\nparameters of the system are tuned and as the gap is closed by means of a\nmagnetic field. We systematically extract system parameters by using numerical\nrenormalization group theory fits as a level of the quantum dot is tuned\nthrough a quantum phase transition electrostatically and magnetically. We also\ngive an intuitive description of sub-gap excitations.\n", "  We report interlayer electronic transport in CaMnBi$_{2}$ single crystals.\nQuantum oscillations and angular magnetoresistance suggest coherent electronic\nconduction and valley polarized conduction of Dirac states. Small cyclotron\nmass, large mobility of carriers and nontrivial Berry's phase are consistent\nwith the presence of Dirac fermions on the side wall of the warped cylindrical\nFermi surface. Similar to SrMnBi$_{2}$ that features an anisotropic Dirac cone,\nour results suggest that magnetic field-induced changes in the interlayer\nconduction are also present in layered bismuth-based materials with zero-energy\nline in momentum space created by the staggered alkaline earth atoms.\n"]}
