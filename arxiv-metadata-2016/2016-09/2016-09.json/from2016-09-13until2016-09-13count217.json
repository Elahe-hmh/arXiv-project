For the two-parameter\ntruncated elliptical billiard the existence and linear stability of several\nlowest-order periodic orbits are investigated in the full parameter space.\nPoincar\\' e plots are computed and used for evaluation of the degree of\nchaoticity with the box-counting method. The limit of the fully chaotic\nbehavior is identified with circular arcs. Above this limit, for flattened\nelliptical arcs, mixed dynamics with numerous stable elliptic islands is\npresent, similarly as in the elliptical stadium billiards. Below this limit the\nfull chaos extends over the whole region of elongated shapes and the existing\norbits are either unstable or neutral. This is conspicuously different from the\nbehavior in the elliptical stadium billiards, where the chaotic region is\nstrictly bounded from both sides. To examine the mechanism of this difference,\na generalization to a novel three-parameter family of boundary shapes is\nproposed and suggested for further evaluation.\n", "  The diffusion/relaxation behavior of polarized spins of pore filling fluid,\nas often probed by NMR relaxometry, is widely used to extract information on\nthe pore-geometry. Such information is further interpreted as an indicator of\nthe key transport property of the formation in the oil industry. As the\nimportance of reservoirs with complex pore geometry grows, so does the need for\ndeeper understanding of how these properties are inter-related. Numerical\nmodeling of relevant physical processes using a known pore geometry promises to\nbe an effective tool in such endeavor. Using a suite of numerical techniques\nbased on random-walk (RW) and Lattice-Boltzmann (LB) algorithms, we compare\nsandstone and carbonate pore geometries in their impact on NMR and flow\nproperties. For NMR relaxometry, both laboratory measurement and simulation\nwere done on the same source to address some of the long-standing issues in its\nborehole applications. Through a series of \"numerical experiments\" in which the\ninterfacial relaxation properties of the pore matrix is varied systematically,\nwe study the effect of a variable surface relaxivity while fully incorporating\nthe complexity of the pore geometry. From combined RW and LB simulations, we\nalso obtain diffusion-convection propagator and compare the result with\nexperimental and network-simulation counterparts.\n", "  In the present work we propose that a one-dimensional quantum heterostructure\ncomposed of magnetic and non-magnetic atomic sites can be utilized as a spin\nfilter for a wide range of applied bias voltage. A simple tight-binding\nframework is given to describe the conducting junction where the\nheterostructure is coupled to two semi-infinite one-dimensional non-magnetic\nelectrodes. Based on transfer matrix method all the calculations are performed\nnumerically which describe two-terminal spin dependent transmission probability\nalong with junction current through the wire. Our detailed analysis may provide\nfundamental aspects of selective spin transport phenomena in one-dimensional\nheterostructures at nano-scale level.\n", "  We investigate the induced geodesic deviation equations in the brane world\nmodels, in which all the matter forces except gravity are confined on the\n3-brane. Also, the Newtonian limit of induced geodesic deviation equation is\nstudied. We show that in the first Randall-Sundrum model the Bohr-Sommerfeld\nquantization rule is as a result of consistency between the geodesic and\ngeodesic deviation equations. This indicates that the path of test particle is\nmade up of integral multiples of a fundamental Compton-type unit of length\n$h/mc$.\n", "  The technological conditions of oxygen content variation in epitaxial\nLa0.7Sr0.3MnO3-{\\delta} films and the peculiarities of change of their\ntransport characteristics were investigated. The films were grown onto single\ncrystal SrTiO3 substrates by an enhanced method of dc magnetron sputtering of a\nceramic target. It was revealed, that the oxygen content of the film material\nwith initially strong deviation from stoichiometric composition ({\\delta}>0.06)\nchanges easily in both directions at temperatures Tp >=870 K, and the result of\nthe oxygen content variation can be well controlled via changes of conductivity\nminimum temperature (Tm). The particularities of indirect accurate control of\nthe oxygen content in the film are described. The existence of oxygen-excessive\ncomposition of the film is in principal agreement with the known phase diagrams\nfor a powder samples. It was revealed, the oxygen-excessive content of the film\ncauses the increase of free charge carriers concentration and the decrease of\nthe film conductivity in ferromagnetic state. It is shown, that the\noxygen-deficient films can demonstrate the same peculiarity of magnetotransport\nproperties as the films with a deviation from stoichiometric content in cation\ncomposition.\n", "  The motivation for this article came from an attempt to give an alternative\ndefinition for the meter, the SI unit for measuring length. As a starting point\ntowards this goal, in this piece of work we present the underlying theory\nbehind our approach which uses ideas from quantum field theory and\nnoncommutative geometry, in particular the notion of an odd K-cycle which is\nbased on the Dirac operator (and its inverse, the Dirac propagator). Using (the\nperhaps more familiar) physics terminology, the key point in our strategy is\nthis: instead of measuring length directly in space-time we measure the\n\"algebraic (spectral) length\" in the space of the corresponding quantum states\nof some particle (fermion) acted upon by the Dirac propagator. This approach\nshares the spirit of the unanimus vote of the 24th General Conference of\nStandards and Measures (21st October 2011) in Serves, France for the\nredefinition of the fundamental units using Planck's constant.\n", "  The first measurement of neutron emission in electromagnetic dissociation of\n$^{208}$Pb nuclei at the LHC is presented. The measurement is performed using\nthe neutron Zero Degree Calorimeters of the ALICE experiment, which detect\nneutral particles close to beam rapidity. The measured cross sections of single\nand mutual electromagnetic dissociation of Pb nuclei at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$ =\n2.76 TeV with neutron emission are $\\sigma_{\\rm single\\ EMD} = 187.4\\pm0.2$\n(stat.) $^{+13.2} _{-11.2}$ (syst.) b and $\\sigma_{\\rm mutual\\ EMD} =\n5.7\\pm0.1$ (stat.) $\\pm$0.4 (syst.) b, respectively. The experimental results\nare compared to the predictions from a relativistic electromagnetic\ndissociation model.\n", "  In this Letter we report the first results on $\\pi^\\pm$, K$^\\pm$, p and\n$\\mathrm {p\\overline{p}}$ production at mid-rapidity ($\\left|y\\right|<0.5$) in\ncentral Pb-Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$ = 2.76 TeV, measured by the\nALICE experiment at the LHC. The $p_{\\rm T}$ distributions and yields are\ncompared to previous results at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$ = 200 GeV and expectations\nfrom hydrodynamic and thermal models. The spectral shapes indicate a strong\nincrease of the radial flow velocity with $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$, which in\nhydrodynamic models is expected as a consequence of the increasing particle\ndensity. While the ${\\rm K}/\\pi$ ratio is in line with predictions from the\nthermal model, the ${\\rm p}/\\pi$ ratio is found to be lower by a factor of\nabout 1.5. This deviation from thermal model expectations is still to be\nunderstood.\n", "  In this paper we will try to provide a formalization of some characteristics\nof the development of biological systems aiming at the highest level of\nadequacy: justificative adequacy, that is, not only what we observe\n(descriptive adequacy) and how we think it occurs (explanatory adequacy) but\nalso what architectural properties (in terms of matter configuration, for\nexample) license the occurrence of certain phenomena. In the case of a\nbiological instantiation of a physical system, justificative adequacy is to be\nfound in the genotype-phenotype dynamics. Moreover, we will claim that such\ndynamics should be analyzed from a mathematical point of view, since the\ngenotype is hypersensitive to initial conditions: a small change in a certain\nstate of the system may have drastic effects on the output. Regarding\nmethodology, we will use chaos theory applied to biology and also physical\ngenetics in order to frame our research and give it theoretical weight.\n", "  We study the effect of H I ionizing photons escaping from high-redshift\n(high-z) galaxies have on the He II ionizing ultraviolet background (UVB)\nradiation. While these photons do not directly interact with He II ions, we\nshow that they play an important role, through radiative transport, in\nmodifying the shape of He II ionizing part of UVB spectrum. Within the observed\nrange of UV escape from galaxies, we show that the rapid increase in He II\nLyman alpha effective optical depth at z~2.7 can naturally be explained by\nradiative transport effects. Therefore, the relationship between a well\nmeasured He II Lyman alpha effective optical depth and the redshift in the\npost-He II reionization era can be used to place additional constraints on the\nredshift evolution of UV escape from high-z galaxies. Our study also suggests\nthat the escape fraction of H I ionizing photons from galaxies has an important\nrole in the fluctuations of the He II ionizing UVB.\n", "  We present an important contribution to the non-commutative approach to the\nhydrogen atom to deal with lamb shift corrections. This can be done by studying\nthe Klein-Gordon and Dirac equations in a non-commutative space-time up to\nfirst-order of the non-commutativity parameter using the Seiberg-Witten maps.\nWe thus find the non-commutative modification of the energy levels and by\ncomparing with the the current experimental results on the Lamb shift of the 2P\nlevel to extract a bound on the parameter of non-commutativity, we show that\nthe fundamental length ($\\sqrt{\\Theta}$) is compatible with the value of the\nelectroweak length scale ($l$). Phenomenologically, this effectively confirms\nthe presence of gravity at this level.\n", "  H{\\alpha} observations centred on galaxies selected from the HI Parkes All\nSky Survey (HIPASS, Barnes et al. 2001) typically show one and sometimes two\nstar-forming galaxies within the approximately 15-arcminute beam of the Parkes\n64-m HI detections. In our Survey of Ionization in Neutral Gas Galaxies (SINGG,\nMeurer et al. 2006) we found fifteen cases of HIPASS sources containing four or\nmore emission line galaxies (ELGs). We name these fields Choir groups. In the\nmost extreme case we found a field with at least nine ELGs. In this paper we\npresent a catalogue of Choir group members in the context of the wider SINGG\nsample. The dwarf galaxies in the Choir groups would not be individually\ndetectable in HIPASS at the observed distances if they were isolated, but are\ndetected in SINGG narrow-band imaging due to their membership of groups with\nsufficiently large total HI mass. The ELGs in these groups are similar to the\nwider SINGG sample in terms of size, H{\\alpha} equivalent width, and surface\nbrightness. Eight of these groups have two large spiral galaxies with several\ndwarf galaxies and may be thought of as morphological analogues of the Local\nGroup. However, on average our groups are not significantly HI-deficient,\nsuggesting that they are at an early stage of assembly, and more like the M81\ngroup. The Choir groups are very compact at typically only 190 kpc in projected\ndistance between the two brightest members. They are very similar to SINGG\nfields in terms of star formation efficiency (the ratio of star formation rate\nto HI mass; SFE), showing an increasing trend in SFE with stellar mass.\n", "  We study both the short term and long term effects of solar activity on the\nlarge transformers (150kV and 400kV) of the Greek national electric grid. We\nuse data analysis and various analytic and statistical methods and models.\nContrary to the common belief in PPC Greece, we see that there are considerable\nboth short term (immediate) and long term effects of solar activity onto large\ntransformers in a mid-latitude country (latitude approx. 35 - 41 degrees North)\nlike Greece. Our results can be summarized as follows: For the short term\neffects: During 1989-2010 there were 43 stormy days (namely days with for\nexample Ap larger or equal to 100) and we had 19 failures occurring during a\nstormy day plus or minus 3 days and 51 failures occurring during a stormy day\nplus or minus 7 days. All these failures can be directly related to\nGeomagnetically Induced Currents (GICs). Explicit cases are presented. For the\nlong term effects we have two main results: The annual transformer failure\nnumber for the period of study 1989-2010 follows the solar activity pattern (11\nyear periodicity, bell-shaped graph). Yet the maximum number of transformer\nfailures occur 3-4 years after the maximum of solar activity. There is\nstatistical correlation between solar activity expressed using various newly\ndefined long term solar activity indices and the annual number of transformer\nfailures. These new long term solar activity indices were defined using both\nlocal (from geomagnetic stations in Greece) and global (planetary averages)\ngeomagnetic data. Applying both linear and non-linear statistical regression we\ncompute the regression equations and the corresponding coefficients of\ndetermination.\n", "  In the present work we will present and analyze some basic processes at the\nlocal and global level in linguistic derivations that seem to go beyond the\nlimits of Markovian or Turing-like computation, and require, in our opinion, a\nquantum processor. We will first present briefly the working hypothesis and\nthen focus on the empirical domain. At the same time, we will argue that a\nmodel appealing to only one kind of computation (be it quantum or not) is\nnecessarily insufficient, and thus both linear and non-linear formal models are\nto be invoked in order to pursue a fuller understanding of mental computations\nwithin a unified framework.\n", "  I present an alternative and rather direct way to derive the well known\nSchr\\\"odinger equation for a quantum wavefunction, by starting with the Klein\nGordon equation and applying a directional factorization scheme. And since if\nyou have a directionally factorizing hammer, everything looks like a\nfactorizable nail, I also derive an alternative wavefunction propagation\nequation in the momentum-dominated limit. This new Schr\\\"odinger $p$-equation\ntherefore provides a potentially useful complement to the traditional\nSchr\\\"odinger $m$-equation's mass-dominated limit.\n", "  Similarity between the gravitoelectromagnetism and the electromagnetism is\ndiscussed. We show that the gravitomagnetic field (similar to the magnetic\nfield) can be equivalent to the non-commutative effect of the momentum sector\nof the phase space when one maintains only the first order of the\nnon-commutative parameters. This is performed through two approaches. In one\napproach, by employing the Feynman proof, the existence of a Lorentz-like force\nin the gravitoelectromagnetism is indicated. The appearance of such a force is\nsubjected to the slow motion and the weak field approximations for stationary\nfields. The analogy between this Lorentz-like force and the motion equation of\na test particle in a non-commutative space leads to the mentioned equivalency.\nIn fact, this equivalency is achieved by the comparison of the two motion\nequations. In the other and quietly independent approach, we demonstrate that a\ngravitomagnetic background can be treated as a Dirac constraint. That is, the\ngravitoelectromagnetic field can be regarded as a constrained system from the\nsense of the Dirac theory. Indeed, the application of the Dirac formalism for\nthe gravitoelectromagnetic field reveals that the phase space coordinates have\nnon-commutative structure from the view of the Dirac bracket. Particularly, the\ngravitomagnetic field as a weak field induces the non-trivial Dirac bracket of\nthe momentum sector which displays the non-commutativity.\n", "  We study the quantum phases of a Bose-Hubbard model with staggered magnetic\nflux in two dimensions, as has been realized recently [Aidelsburger {\\it et\nal.}, PRL, {\\bf 107}, 255301 (2011)]. Within mean field theory, we show how the\nstructure of the condensates evolves from weak to strong coupling limit,\nexhibiting a tricritical point at the Mott-superfluid transition. Non-trivial\ntopological structures (Dirac points) in the quasi-particle (hole) excitations\nin the Mott state are found within random phase approximation and we discuss\nhow interaction modifies their structures. Excitation gap in the Mott state\ncloses at different ${\\bf k}$ points when approaching the superfluid states,\nwhich is consistent with the findings of mean field theory.\n", "  We give the three-dimensional dynamical autonomous systems for most of the\npopular scalar field dark energy models including (phantom) quintessence,\n(phantom) tachyon, k-essence and general non-canonical scalar field models,\nchange the dynamical variables from variables $(x, y, \\lambda)$ to observable\nrelated variables $(w_{\\phi}, \\Omega_{\\phi}, \\lambda)$, and show the intimate\nrelationships between those scalar fields that the three-dimensional system of\nk-essence can reduce to (phantom) tachyon, general non-canonical scalar field\ncan reduce to (phantom) quintessence and k-essence can also reduce to (phantom)\nquintessence for some special cases. For the applications of the\nthree-dimensional dynamical systems, we investigate several special cases and\ngive the exactly dynamical solutions in detail. In the end of this paper, we\nargue that, it is more convenient and also has more physical meaning to express\nthe differential equations of dynamical systems in $(w_{\\phi}, \\Omega_{\\phi},\n\\lambda)$ instead of variables $(x, y, \\lambda)$ and to investigate the\ndynamical system in 3-Dimension instead of 2-Dimension. We also raise a\nquestion about the possibility of the chaotic behavior in the spatially flat\nsingle scalar field FRW cosmological models in the presence of ordinary matter.\n", "  We investigate the spectrum and the dispersion relation of the Schr\\\"odinger\noperator with point scatterers on a triangular lattice and a honeycomb lattice.\nWe prove that the low-level dispersion bands have conic singularities near\nDirac points, which are the vertices of the first Brillouin Zone. The existence\nof such conic dispersion bands plays an important role in various electronic\nproperties of honeycomb-structured materials such as graphene. We then prove\nthat for a honeycomb lattice, the spectra generated by higher-level dispersion\nrelations are all connected so the complete spectrum consists of at most three\nbands. Numerical simulations for dispersion bands with various parameters are\nalso presented.\n", "  Magnetic ordering of itinerant fermionic systems is at the forefront of\ncondensed matter physics dating back to Stoner's instability. Spin-orbit\ncoupling (SOC) which couples two essential ingredients of an itinerant\nfermionic system, namely spin and orbital motion, opens up new horizons to this\nlong-standing problem. Here we report that the itinerant ferromagnetism is\nabsent in 3D Fermi gas with a Weyl SOC and various itinerant spin density waves\nemerge instead, which is deeply rooted in the unique symmetry and spin-momentum\nlocking effect in spin-orbit coupled systems. What is more appealing is that,\nthe strong SOC provides a new and efficient mechanism to realize itinerant spin\ndensity waves at extremely weak repulsion---a significant benefit for present\nultra-cold atom experiment. These novel phenomena can be probed by Bragg\nspectroscopy, time of flight imaging and {\\sl In-Situ } measurements in\nultra-cold atom experiment.\n", "  The Solar Dynamics Observatory/Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (SDO/HMI)\nfiltergrams, taken at six wavelengths around the Fe I 6173.3 {\\AA} line,\ncontain information about the line-of-sight velocity over a range of heights in\nthe solar atmosphere. Multi-height velocity inferences from these observations\ncan be exploited to study wave motions and energy transport in the atmosphere.\nUsing realistic convection simulation datasets provided by the STAGGER and\nMURaM codes, we generate synthetic filtergrams and explore several methods for\nestimating Dopplergrams. We investigate at which height each synthetic\nDopplergram correlates most strongly with the vertical velocity in the model\natmospheres. On the basis of the investigation, we propose two Dopplergrams\nother than the standard HMI-algorithm Dopplergram produced from HMI\nfiltergrams: a line-center Dopplergram and an average-wing Dopplergram. These\ntwo Dopplergrams correlate most strongly with vertical velocities at the\nheights of 30 - 40 km above (line-center) and 30 - 40 km below (average-wing)\nthe effective height of the HMI-algorithm Dopplergram. Therefore, we can obtain\nvelocity information from two layers separated by about a half of a scale\nheight in the atmosphere, at best. The phase shifts between these multi-height\nDopplergrams from observational data as well as those from the simulated data\nare also consistent with the height-difference estimates in the frequency range\nabove the photospheric acoustic cutoff frequency.\n", "  At any given epoch, the Extragalactic Background Light (EBL) carries imprints\nof integrated star formation activities in the universe till that epoch. On the\nother hand, in order to estimate the EBL, when direct observations are not\npossible, one requires an accurate estimation of the star formation rate\ndensity (SFRD) and the dust attenuation ($A_\\nu$) in galaxies. Here, we present\na 'progressive fitting method' that determines global average SFRD($z$) and\n$A_\\nu(z)$ for any given extinction curve by using the available\nmulti-wavelength multi-epoch galaxy luminosity function measurements. Using the\navailable observations, we determine the best fitted combinations of SFRD($z$)\nand $A_\\nu(z)$, in a simple fitting form, up to $z\\sim8$ for five well known\nextinction curves. We find, irrespective of the extinction curve used, the $z$\nat which the SFRD($z$) peaks is higher than the $z$ above which $A_\\nu(z)$\nbegins to decline. For each case, we compute the EBL from ultra-violet to the\nfar-infrared and optical depth ($\\tau_\\gamma$) encountered by the high energy\n$\\gamma$-rays due to pair production upon collisions with these EBL photons. We\ncompare these with measurements of the local EBL, $\\gamma$-ray horizon and\n$\\tau_\\gamma$ measurements using Fermi-LAT. All these and the comparison of\nindependent SFRD($z$) and $A_\\nu(z)$ measurements from the literature with our\npredictions favor the extinction curve similar to that of Large Magellanic\nCloud Supershell.\n", "  We present a quantum communication experiment conducted over a point-to-point\nfree-space link of 1.6 km in urban conditions. We study atmospheric influences\non the capability of the link to act as a continuous-variable (CV) quantum\nchannel. Continuous polarization states (that contain the signal encoding as\nwell as a local oscillator in the same spatial mode) are prepared and sent over\nthe link in a polarization multiplexed setting. Both signal and local\noscillator undergo the same atmospheric fluctuations. These are intrinsically\nauto-compensated which removes detrimental influences on the interferometric\nvisibility. At the receiver, we measure the Q-function and interpret the data\nusing the framework of effective entanglement. We compare different state\namplitudes and alphabets (two-state and four-state) and determine their optimal\nworking points with respect to the distributed effective entanglement. Based on\nthe high entanglement transmission rates achieved, our system indicates the\nhigh potential of atmospheric links in the field of CV QKD.\n", "  A method is suggested to decompose the statistical and systematic\nuncertainties from the residues between the calculation of a theoretical model\nand the observed data. The residues and the parameters of the model can be\nobtained through the standard statistical fitting procedures. The present work\nconcentrates on the decomposition of the total uncertainty, of which the\ndistribution corresponds to that of the residues. The distribution of the total\nuncertainty is considered as two normal distributions, statistical and\nsystematic uncertainties. The standard deviation of the statistical part,\n{\\sigma}stat, is estimated through random parameters distributed around their\nbest fitted values. The two normal distributions are obtained by minimizing the\nmoments of the distribution of the residues with the fixed {\\sigma}stat. The\nmethod is applied to the liquid drop model (LD). The statistical and systematic\nuncertainties are decomposed from the residues of the nuclear binding energies\nwith and without the consideration of the shell effect in LD. The estimated\ndistributions of the statistical and systematic uncertainties can well describe\nthat of the residues. The normal assumption of the distribution of the\nstatistical and systematic uncertainties is examined through various\napproaches. The comparison between the distributions of the specific nuclei and\nthose of the statistical and systematic uncertainties are consistent with the\nphysical considerations, although the latter two can be obtained without the\nknowledge of these considerations. Such as, the LD are more suitable to\ndescribe the heavy nuclei. The light and heavy nuclei are indeed distributed\nmostly inside the distributions of the statistical and systematic\nuncertainties, respectively. The similar situation are also found for the\nnuclei close to and far from shell. The present method is also performed to\nnuclei around stability line.\n", "  We state Asymptotic Expansion and Growth Rate conjectures for the\nWitten-Reshetikhin-Turaev invariants of arbitrary framed links in 3-manifolds,\nand we prove these conjectures for the natural links in mapping tori of\nfinite-order automorphisms of marked surfaces. Our approach is based upon\ngeometric quantisation of the moduli space of parabolic bundles on the surface,\nwhich we show coincides with the construction of the Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev\ninvariants using conformal field theory, as was recently completed by Andersen\nand Ueno.\n", "  The removal of the Galactic and extragalactic foregrounds remains a major\nchallenge for those wishing to make a detection of the Epoch of Reionization\n21-cm signal. Multiple methods of modelling these foregrounds with varying\nlevels of assumption have been trialled and shown promising recoveries on\nsimulated data. Recently however there has been increased discussion of using\nthe expected shape of the foregrounds in Fourier space to define an EoR window\nfree of foreground contamination. By carrying out analysis within this window\nonly, one can avoid the foregrounds and any statistical bias they might\nintroduce by instead removing these foregrounds. In this paper we discuss the\nadvantages and disadvantages of both foreground removal and foreground\navoidance. We create a series of simulations with noise levels in line with\nboth current and future experiments and compare the recovered statistical\ncosmological signal from foreground avoidance and a simplified, frequency\nindependent foreground removal model. We find that while, for current\ngeneration experiments, foreground avoidance enables a better recovery at\n$k_{perp} > 0.6 \\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, foreground removal is able to recover\nsignificantly more signal at small $k_{los}$ for both current and future\nexperiments. We also relax the assumption that the foregrounds are smooth by\nintroducing a Gaussian random factor along the line-of-sight and then also\nspatially. We find that both methods perform well for foreground models with\nline-of-sight and spatial variations around $0.1\\%$ however at levels larger\nthan this foregrounds removal shows a greater signal recovery.\n", "  The relation between integrable systems and algebraic geometry is known since\nthe XIXth century. The modern approach is to represent an integrable system as\na Lax equation with spectral parameter. In this approach, the integrals of the\nsystem turn out to be the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial $\\chi$\nof the Lax matrix, and the solutions are expressed in terms of theta functions\nrelated to the curve $\\chi = 0$. The aim of the present paper is to show that\nthe possibility to write an integrable system in the Lax form, as well as the\nalgebro-geometric technique related to this possibility, may also be applied to\nstudy qualitative features of the system, in particular its singularities.\n", "  We give a comprehensive analysis of the Euler-Jacobi problem of motion in the\nfield of two fixed centers with arbitrary relative strength and for positive\nvalues of the energy. These systems represent nontrivial examples of integrable\ndynamics and are analysed from the point of view of the energy-momentum mapping\nfrom the phase space to the space of the integration constants. In this setting\nwe describe the structure of the scattering trajectories in phase space and\nderive an explicit description of the bifurcation diagram, i.e. the set of\ncritical value of the energy-momentum map.\n", "  Consider an arbitrary local quantum field theory with a gap or an arbitrary\ngapless free theory. We consider states in such a theory, that describe two\nentangled particles localized in disjoint regions of space. We show that in\nsuch a state, to leading order, R\\'{e}nyi entropies of spatial regions,\ncontaining only one of the particles are same as their quantum mechanical\ncounterparts, after subtraction of vacuum contribution. Subleading corrections\ndepend on overlap of wave functions. These results suggest that Von Neumann\nentropy of a spatial region, after subtraction of vacuum contribution, can\nserve as a measure of entanglement of indistinguishable particles in pure\nstates.\n", "  We present a technique for the dissipative preparation of highly entangled\nmultiparticle states of atoms coupled to common oscillator modes. By combining\nlocal spontaneous emission with coherent couplings we engineer many-body\ndissipation that drives the system from an arbitrary initial state into a\nGreenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state. We demonstrate that using our technique,\nhighly entangled steady states can be prepared efficiently in a time that\nscales polynomially with the system size. Our protocol assumes generic\ncouplings and will thus enable the dissipative production of multiparticle\nentanglement in a wide range of physical systems. As an example, we demonstrate\nthe feasibility of our scheme in state-of-the-art trapped-ion systems.\n", "  A conservation law is one of the most fundamental properties in nature, but a\ncertain class of conservation \"laws\"' could be spoiled by intrinsic quantum\nmechanical effects, so-called quantum anomalies. Profound properties of the\nanomalies have deepened our understanding in quantum many body systems. Here,\nwe investigate quantum anomaly effects in quantum phase transitions between\ncompeting orders and striking consequences of their presence. We explicitly\ncalculate topological nature of anomalies of non-linear sigma models (NLSMs)\nwith the Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) terms. The non-perturbative nature is\ndirectly related with the 't Hooft anomaly matching condition : anomalies are\nconserved in renormalization group flow. By applying the matching condition, we\nshow massless excitations are enforced by the anomalies in a whole phase\ndiagram in sharp contrast to the case of the Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson theory\nwhich only has massive excitations in symmetric phases. Furthermore, we find\nnon-perturbative criteria to characterize quantum phase transitions between\ncompeting orders. For example, in 4D, we show the two competing order parameter\ntheories, CP(1) and the NLSM with WZW, describe different universality class.\nPhysical realizations and experimental implication of the anomalies are also\ndiscussed.\n", "  We consider a class of unbounded self-adjoint operators including the\nHamiltonian of the Jaynes-Cummings model without the rotating-wave\napproximation (RWA). The corresponding operators are defined by infinite Jacobi\nmatrices with discrete spectrum. Our purpose is to give the asymptotic behavior\nof large eigenvalues.\n", "  The deformation of monolayer graphene, produced by chemical vapor deposition\n(CVD), on a polyester film substrate has been investigated through the use of\nRaman spectroscopy. It has been found that the microstructure of the CVD\ngraphene consists of a hexagonal array of islands of flat monolayer graphene\nseparated by wrinkled material. During deformation, it was found that the rate\nof shift of the Raman 2D band wavenumber per unit strain was less than 25% of\nthat of flat flakes of mechanically-exfoliated graphene, whereas the rate of\nband broadening per unit strain was about 75% of that of the exfoliated\nmaterial. This unusual deformation behavior has been modeled in terms of\nmechanically-isolated graphene islands separated by the graphene wrinkles, with\nthe strain distribution in each graphene island determined using shear lag\nanalysis. The effect of the size and position of the Raman laser beam spot has\nalso been incorporated in the model. The predictions fit well with the behavior\nobserved experimentally for the Raman band shifts and broadening of the\nwrinkled CVD graphene. The effect of wrinkles upon the efficiency of graphene\nto reinforce nanocomposites is also discussed.\n", "  We investigate the recent claim of 'photon underproduction crisis' by\nKollmeier et al. (2014) which suggests that the known sources of ultra-violet\n(UV) radiation may not be sufficient to generate the inferred hydrogen\nphotoionization rate ($\\Gamma_{\\rm HI}$) in the low redshift inter-galactic\nmedium. Using the updated QSO emissivities from the recent studies and our\ncosmological radiative transfer code developed to estimate the UV background,\nwe show that the QSO contribution to $\\Gamma_{\\rm HI}$ is higher by a factor ~2\nas compared to the previous estimates. Using self-consistently computed\ncombinations of star formation rate density and dust attenuation, we show that\na typical UV escape fraction of 4% from star forming galaxies should be\nsufficient to explain the inferred $\\Gamma_{\\rm HI}$ by Kollmeier et al.\n(2014). Interestingly, we find that the contribution from QSOs alone can\nexplain the recently inferred $\\Gamma_{\\rm HI}$ by Shull et al. (2015) which\nused the same observational data but different simulation. Therefore, we\nconclude that the crisis is not as severe as it was perceived before and there\nseems no need to look for alternate explanations such as low luminosity hidden\nQSOs or decaying dark matter particles.\n", "  We discuss a non-quantized Gaussian flux limited to vary in a specific region\nof space which describes the Coulombic potential as well as confinement at\nintermediate distances for color potentials in various representations. Our\ncalculations show if uncorrelated vortices are not quantized with center\nelements, the N-ality dependence of asymptotic string tensions is lost while\nthe ratio of the Coulombic strengths and intermediate string tensions are in\nagreement with Casimir scaling. Using both uncorrelated quantized and\nnon-quantized fluxes in the potential between static color sources results in\nthe correct N-ality dependence at large distances and very good agreement with\nCasimir scaling at short and intermediate distances.\n", "  We study theoretically interaction potentials and low energy collisions\nbetween different alkali atoms and alkali ions. Specifically, we consider\nsystems like X + Y$^{+}$, where X(Y$^{+})$ is either Li(Cs$^+$) or Cs(Li$^+$),\nNa(Cs$^+$) or Cs(Na$^+$) and Li(Rb$^+$) or Rb(Li$^+$). We calculate the\nmolecular potentials of the ground and first two excited states of these three\nsystems using pseudopotential method and compare our results with those\nobtained by others. We derive ground-state scattering wave functions and\nanalyze cold collisional properties of these systems for a wide range of\nenergies. We find that, in order to get convergent results for the total\nscattering cross sections for energies of the order 1 K, one needs to take into\naccount at least 60 partial waves. Low energy scattering properties calculated\nin this paper may serve as a precursor for experimental exploration of quantum\ncollisions between an alkali atom and an alkali ion of different nucleus.\n", "  Multilayer infrastructure is often interdependent, with nodes in one layer\ndepending on nearby nodes in another layer to function. The links in each layer\nare often of limited length, due to the construction cost of longer links.\nHere, we model such systems as a multiplex network composed of two or more\nlayers, each with links of characteristic geographic length, embedded in\n2-dimensional space. This is equivalent to a system of interdependent spatially\nembedded networks in two dimensions in which the connectivity links are\nconstrained in length but varied while the length of the dependency links is\nalways zero. We find two distinct percolation transition behaviors depending on\nthe characteristic length, $\\zeta$, of the links. When $\\zeta$ is longer than a\ncertain critical value, $\\zeta_c$, abrupt, first-order transitions take place,\nwhile for $\\zeta<\\zeta_c$ the transition is continuous. We show that, though in\nsingle-layer networks increasing $\\zeta$ decreases the percolation threshold\n$p_c$, in multiplex networks it has the opposite effect: increasing $p_c$ to a\nmaximum at $\\zeta=\\zeta_c$. By providing a more realistic topological model for\nspatially embedded interdependent and multiplex networks and highlighting its\nsimilarities to lattice-based models, we provide a new direction for more\ndetailed future studies.\n", "  NGC 4203 is a nearby early-type galaxy surrounded by a very large,\nlow-column-density HI disc. In this paper we study the star formation\nefficiency in the gas disc of NGC 4203 by using the UV, deep optical imaging\nand infrared data. We confirm that the HI disc consists of two distinct\ncomponents: an inner star forming ring with radius from $\\sim$ 1 to $\\sim$ 3\nR$_{eff}$, and an outer disc. The outer HI disc is 9 times more massive than\nthe inner HI ring. At the location of the inner HI ring we detect spiral-like\nstructure both in the deep $g'-r'$ image and in the 8 $\\mu$m $Spitzer$-IRAC\nimage, extending in radius up to $\\sim$ 3 R$_{eff}$. These two gas components\nhave a different star formation efficiency likely due to the different\nmetallicity and dust content. The inner component has a star formation\nefficiency very similar to the inner regions of late-type galaxies. Although\nthe outer component has a very low star formation efficiency, it is similar to\nthat of the outer regions of spiral galaxies and dwarfs. We suggest that these\ndifferences can be explained with different gas origins for the two components\nsuch as stellar mass loss for the inner HI ring and accretion from the inter\ngalactic medium (IGM) for the outer HI disc. The low level star formation\nefficiency in the outer HI disc is not enough to change the morphology of NGC\n4203, making the depletion time of the HI gas much too long.\n", "  In this paper we evaluate the dynamic effects of the fluid viscosity for\nfluid filled elastic tubes in the framework of a linear uni-axial theory.\n  Because of the linear approximation, the effects on the fluid inside the\nelastic tube are taken into account according to the Womersley theory for a\npulsatile flow in a rigid tube.\n  The evolution equations for the response variables are derived by means of\nthe Laplace transform technique and they all turn out to be very same\nintegro-differential equation of the convolution type.\n  This equation has the same structure as the one describing uni-axial waves in\nlinear viscoelastic solids characterized by a relaxation modulus or by a creep\ncompliance. In our case, the analogy is connected with a peculiar viscoelastic\nsolid which exhibits creep properties similar to those of a fractional Maxwell\nmodel (of order 1/2) for short times, and of a standard Maxwell model for long\ntimes.\n  The present analysis could find applications in biophysics concerning the\npropagation of pressure waves within large arteries.\n", "  We derive a generalized set of Ward identities that captures the effects of\ntopological charge on Hall transport. The Ward identities follow from the 2+1\ndimensional momentum algebra, which includes a central extension proportional\nto the topological charge density. In the presence of topological objects like\nSkyrmions, we observe that the central term leads to a direct relation between\nthe thermal Hall conductivity and the topological charge density. We extend\nthis relation to incorporate the effects of a magnetic field and an electric\ncurrent. The topological charge density produces a distinct signature in the\nelectric Hall conductivity, which is identified in existing experimental data,\nand yields further novel predictions. For insulating materials with translation\ninvariance, the Hall viscosity can be directly determined from the Skyrmion\ndensity and the thermal Hall conductivity to be measured as a function of\nmomentum.\n", "  Humans routinely solve problems of immense computational complexity by\nintuitively forming simple, low-dimensional heuristic strategies. Citizen\nscience exploits this ability by presenting scientific research problems to\nnon-experts. Gamification is an effective tool for attracting citizen\nscientists to provide solutions to research problems. While citizen science\ngames Foldit, EteRNA and EyeWire have been used successfully to study protein\nand RNA folding and neuron mapping, so far gamification has not been applied to\nproblems in quantum physics. Does the fact that everyday experiences are based\non classical physics hinder the use of non-expert citizen scientists in the\nrealm of quantum mechanics? Here we report on Quantum Moves, an online platform\ngamifying optimization problems in quantum physics. We show that human players\nare able to find solutions to difficult problems associated with the task of\nquantum computing. Players succeed where purely numerical optimization fails,\nand analyses of their solutions provide insights into the problem of\noptimization of a more profound and general nature. Based on player strategies,\nwe have thus developed a new, few-parameter heuristic optimization method which\nefficiently outperforms the most prominent established numerical methods. The\nnumerical complexity associated with time-optimal solutions increases for\nshorter process durations. To better understand this, we have made a\nlow-dimensional rendering of the optimization landscape. These studies show why\ntraditional optimization methods fail near the quantum speed limit, and they\nbring promise that combined analyses of optimization landscapes and heuristic\nsolution strategies may benefit wider classes of optimization problems in\nquantum physics and beyond.\n", "  Supercritical state has been viewed as an intermediate state between gases\nand liquids with largely unknown physical properties. Here, we address the\nimportant ability of supercritical fluids to sustain collective excitations. We\ndirectly study propagating modes on the basis of correlation functions\ncalculated from extensive molecular dynamics simulations, and find that the\nsupercritical system sustains propagating solid-like transverse modes below the\nFrenkel line but becomes devoid of transverse modes above the line where it\nsupports longitudinal modes only. Important thermodynamic implications of this\nfinding are discussed. We directly detect positive sound dispersion (PSD) below\nthe Frenkel line where transverse modes are operative, quantitatively explain\nits magnitude on the basis of transverse and longitudinal velocities. PSD\ndisappears above the Frenkel line which therefore demarcates the supercritical\nphase diagram into two areas where PSD does and does not operate.\n", "  Microscopic vapor explosions or cavitation bubbles can be generated\nperiodically in an optical tweezer with a microparticle that partially absorbs\nat the trapping laser wavelength. In this work we measure the size distribution\nand the production rate of cavitation bubbles for microparticles with a\ndiameter of 3 $\\mu$m using high speed video recording and a fast photodiode. We\nfind that there is a lower bound for the maximum bubble radius $R_{max}\\sim\n2~\\mu$m which can be explained in terms of the microparticle size. More than\n$94 \\%$ of the measured $R_{max}$ are in the range between 2 and 6 $\\mu$m,\nwhile the same percentage of the measured individual frequencies $f_i$ or\nproduction rates are between 10 and 200 Hz. The photodiode signal yields an\nupper bound for the lifetime of the bubbles, which is at most twice the value\npredicted by the Rayleigh equation. We also report empirical relations between\n$R_{max}$, $f_i$ and the bubble lifetimes.\n", "  In the Minority Game (MG), an odd number of heterogeneous and adaptive agents\nchoose between two alternatives and those who end up on the minority side win.\nWhen the information available to the agents to make their choice is the\nidentity of the minority side for the past $m$ days, it is well-known that\nemergent coordination among the agents is maximum when $m \\sim \\log_2(N)$. The\noptimal memory-length thus increases with the system size. In this work, we\nshow that, in MG when the information available to the agents to make their\nchoice is the strength of the minority side for the past $m$ days, the optimal\nmemory length for the agents is always two ($m=2$) for large enough system\nsizes. The system is inefficient for $m=1$ and converge to random choice\nbehaviour for $m > 2$ for large $N$. Surprisingly, providing the agents with\nuniformly and randomly sampled $m=1$ exogenous information results in an\nincrease in coordination between them compared to the case of endogenous\ninformation with any value of $m$. This is in stark contrast to the\nconventional MG, where agent's coordination is invariant or gets worse with\nrespect to such random exogenous information.\n", "  We examine charged slowly rotating perfect fluids in the presence of a\ncosmological constant. The asymptotic form of the vacuum solutions to the\nlinearised Einstein-Maxwell field equations is found and the possibility of\nmatching this vacuum to the slow rotating Garc\\'ia metric is considered. We\nshow that, contrary to the case of zero cosmological constant, this Garc\\'ia\nmetric can be matched to an asymptotically de Sitter vacuum in the slow\nrotation limit. We conclude the Garc\\'ia metric may potentially be suitable for\ndescribing a charged isolated rotating body in a cosmological background.\n", "  An integral formulation for acoustic radiation in moving flows is presented.\nIt is based on a potential formulation for acoustic radiation on weakly\nnon-uniform subsonic mean flows. This work is motivated by the absence of\nsuitable kernels for wave propagation on non-uniform flow. The integral\nsolution is formulated using a Green's function obtained by combining the\nTaylor and Lorentz transformations. Although most conventional approaches based\non either transform solve the Helmholtz problem in a transformed domain, the\ncurrent Green's function and associated integral equation are derived in the\nphysical space. A dimensional error analysis is developed to identify the\nlimitations of the current formulation. Numerical applications are performed to\nassess the accuracy of the integral solution. It is tested as a means of\nextrapolating a numerical solution available on the outer boundary of a domain\nto the far field, and as a means of solving scattering problems by rigid\nsurfaces in non-uniform flows. The results show that the error associated with\nthe physical model deteriorates with increasing frequency and mean flow Mach\nnumber. However, the error is generated only in the domain where mean flow\nnon-uniformities are significant and is constant in regions where the flow is\nuniform.\n", "  Wave control is usually performed by spatially engineering the properties of\na medium. Because time and space play similar roles in wave propagation,\nmanipulating time boundaries provides a complementary approach. Here, we\nexperimentally demonstrate the relevance of this concept by introducing\ninstantaneous time mirrors. We show with water waves that a sudden change of\nthe effective gravity generates time-reversed waves that refocus at the source.\nWe generalize this concept for all kinds of waves introducing a universal\nframework which explains the effect of any time disruption on wave propagation.\nWe show that sudden changes of the medium properties generate instant wave\nsources that emerge instantaneously from the entire space at the time\ndisruption. The time-reversed waves originate from these \"Cauchy sources\" which\nare the counterpart of Huygens virtual sources on a time boundary. It allows us\nto revisit the holographic method and introduce a new approach for wave\ncontrol.\n", "  We present detailed ab-initio lattice dynamical analysis of the Fe-O\ninfinite-layer compounds CaFeO2 and SrFeO2 in various magnetic configurations.\nThese indicate strong spin-phonon coupling in SrFeO2 in contrast to that in\ncase of CaFeO2. Powder neutron inelastic scattering experiments on SrFeO2 have\nalso been performed at temperatures from 5 K to 353 K in the antiferromagnetic\nphase and analyzed using the ab-initio calculations. These suggest distortion\nof the ideal infinite planer structure above 300 K. From our ab-initio\ncalculations in SrFeO2 as a function of volume, we suggest that the distortion\nin SrFeO2 above 300 K is similar to that known in CaFeO2 at ambient conditions.\nThe distortion of the planer structure of CaFeO2 involves doubling of the\nplaner unit cell that may be usually expected to be due to a soft phonon mode\nat the M-point (1/2 1/2 0). However, our ab-initio calculations show quite\nunusually that all the M-point (1/2 1/2 0) phonons are stable, but two stable\nM3+ and M2-modes anharmonically couple with an unstable Bu mode at the zone\ncentre and lead to the cell doubling and the distorted structure. Magnetic\nexchange interactions in both the compounds have been computed on the basis of\nthe ideal planar structure (P4/mmm space group) and with increasing amplitude\nof the Bu phonon mode. These reveal that the magnetic exchange interactions\nreduce significantly with increasing distortion. We have extended the ab-initio\nphonon calculation to high pressures, which reveal that, above 20 GPa of\npressure, the undistorted planer CaFeO2 becomes dynamically stable. We also\nreport computed phonon spectra in SrFeO3 that has a cubic structure, which is\nuseful to understand the role of the difference in geometry of oxygen atoms\naround the Fe atom with respect to planer SrFeO2.\n", "  We explore the question of using an entangled state as a universal resource\nfor implementing quantum measurements by local operations and classical\ncommunication (LOCC). We show that for most systems consisting of three or more\nsubsystems, there is no entangled state from the same space that can enable all\nmeasurements by LOCC. This is in direct contrast to the bipartite case, where a\nmaximally entangled state is an universal resource. Our results are obtained\nshowing an equivalence between the problem of local state transformation and\nthat of entanglement-assisted local unambiguous state discrimination.\n", "  We review the energy concept in the case of a continuum or a system of\nfields. First, we analyze the emergence of a true local conservation equation\nfor the energy of a continuous medium, taking the example of an isentropic\ncontinuum in Newtonian gravity. Next, we consider a continuum or a system of\nfields in special relativity: we recall that the conservation of the\nenergy-momentum tensor contains two local conservation equations of the same\nkind as before. We show that both of these equations depend on the reference\nframe, and that, however, they can be given a rigorous meaning. Then we review\nthe definitions of the canonical and Hilbert energy-momentum tensors from a\nLagrangian through the principle of stationary action in a general spacetime.\nUsing relatively elementary mathematics, we prove precise results regarding the\ndefinition of the Hilbert tensor field, its uniqueness, and its tensoriality.\nWe recall the meaning of its covariant conservation equation. We end with a\nproof of uniqueness of the energy density and flux, when both depend\npolynomially of the fields.\n  Keywords: energy conservation; conservation equation; special relativity;\ngeneral relativity; Hilbert tensor; variational principle\n", "  Considering a determinantal point process on the real line, we establish a\nconnection between the sine-kernel asymptotics for the correlation kernel and\nthe CLT for mesoscopic linear statistics. This implies universality of\nmesoscopic fluctuations for a large class of unitary invariant Hermitian\nensembles. In particular, this shows that the support of the equilibrium\nmeasure need not be connected in order to see Gaussian fluctuations at\nmesoscopic scales. Our proof is based on the cumulants computations introduced\nin [48] for the CUE and the sine process and the asymptotics formulae derived\nby Deift et al. in [12]. For varying weights $e^{-N \\tr V (H)}$, in the one-cut\nregime, we also provide estimates for the variance of linear statistics $\\tr\nf(H)$ which are valid for a rather general function $f$. In particular, this\nimplies that the characteristic polynomials of such Hermitian random matrices\nconverge in a suitable regime to a regularized fractional Brownian motion with\nlogarithmic correlations defined in [19]. For the GUE kernel, we also discuss\nhow to obtain the necessary sine-kernel asymptotics at mesoscopic scale by\nelementary means.\n", "  Using our cosmological radiative transfer code, we study the implications of\nthe updated QSO emissivity and star formation history for the escape fraction\n(f_esc) of hydrogen ionizing photons from galaxies. We estimate the f_esc that\nis required to reionize the Universe and to maintain the ionization state of\nthe intergalactic medium in the post-reionization era. At z>5.5, we show that a\nconstant f_esc of 0.14 to 0.22 is sufficient to reionize the Universe. At\nz<3.5, consistent with various observations, we find that f_esc can have values\nfrom 0 to 0.05. However, a steep rise in f_esc, of at least a factor of ~3, is\nrequired between z=3.5 to 5.5. It results from a rapidly decreasing QSO\nemissivity at z>3 together with a nearly constant measured H I photoionization\nrates at 3<z<5. We show that, this requirement of a steep rise in f_esc over a\nvery short time can be relaxed if we consider the contribution from a recently\nfound large number density of faint QSOs at z>4. In addition, a simple\nextrapolation of the contribution of such QSOs to high-z suggests that QSOs\nalone can reionize the Universe. This implies, at z>3.5, that either the\nproperties of galaxies should evolve rapidly to increase the f_esc or most of\nthe low-mass galaxies should host massive black holes and sustain accretion\nover a prolonged period. These results motivate a careful investigation of\ntheoretical predictions of these alternate scenarios that can be distinguished\nusing future observations. Moreover, it is also very important to revisit the\nmeasurements of H I photoionization rates that are crucial to the analysis\npresented here.\n", "  Recently it was pointed out that in shift-symmetric scalar-tensor theories a\nblack hole can have nontrivial scalar hair which depends linearly on time. We\ndevelop black hole perturbation theory for such solutions and compute the\nquadratic action of odd-parity perturbations. We show that around all the\nsolutions known so far with such time-dependent scalar hair the perturbations\ntrigger instabilities or are presumably strongly coupled.\n", "  In a variety of physical situations, a bulk viscous flow is induced by a\ndistribution of surface velocities, for example in diffusiophoresis (as a\nresult of chemical gradients) and above carpets of cilia (as a result of\nbiological activity). When such boundary-driven flows are used to pump fluids,\nthe primary quantity of interest is the induced flow rate. In this letter we\npropose a method, based on the reciprocal theorem of Stokes flows, to compute\nthe net flow rate for arbitrary flow distribution and periodic pump geometry\nusing solely stress information from a dual Poiseuille-like problem. After\nderiving the general result we apply it to straight channels of triangular,\nelliptic and rectangular geometries and quantify the relationship between bulk\nmotion and surface forcing.\n", "  We propose a simple experimental test of the quantum equivalence principle\nintroduced by Zych and Brukner [arXiv:1502.00971], which generalises the\nEinstein equivalence principle to superpositions of internal energy states. We\nconsider a harmonically-trapped spin-$\\frac12$ atom in the presence of both\ngravity and an external magnetic field and show that when the external magnetic\nfield is suddenly switched off, various violations of the equivalence principle\nwould manifest as otherwise forbidden transitions. Performing such an\nexperiment would put bounds on the various phenomenological violating\nparameters. We further demonstrate that the classical weak equivalence\nprinciple can be tested by suddenly putting the apparatus into free fall,\neffectively 'switching off' gravity.\n", "  An efficient, accurate, and flexible numerical method is proposed for the\nsolution of the swimming problem of one or more autophoretic particles in the\npurely-diffusive limit. The method relies on successive boundary element\nsolutions of the Laplacian and the Stokes flow equations using regularised\nGreen's functions for swift, simple implementations, an extension of the\nwell-known method of \"regularised stokeslets\" for Stokes flow problems. The\nboundary element method is particularly suitable for phoretic problems, since\nno quantities in the domain bulk are required to compute the swimming velocity.\nFor time-dependent problems, the method requires no re-meshing and simple\nboundaries such as a plane wall may be added at no increase to the size of the\nlinear system through the method of images. The method is validated against two\nclassical examples for which an analytical or semi-analytical solution is\nknown, a two-sphere system and a Janus particle, and provides a rigorous\ncomputational pipeline to address further problems with complex geometry and\nmultiple bodies.\n", "  Single magnetic skyrmion dynamics in chiral magnets with a spatially\ninhomogeneous Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) is considered. Based on\nthe relation between DMI coupling and skyrmion helicity, it is argued that the\nlatter must be included as an extra degree of freedom in the dynamics of\nskyrmions. An effective description of the skyrmion dynamics for an arbitrary\ninhomogeneous DMI coupling is obtained through the collective coordinates\nmethod. The resulting generalized Thiele's equation is a dynamical system for\nthe center of mass position and helicity of the skyrmion. It is found that the\ndissipative tensor and hence the Hall angle become helicity dependent. The\nskyrmion position and helicity dynamics are fully characterized by our model in\ntwo particular examples of engineered DMI coupling: half-planes with\nopposite-sign DMI and linearly varying DMI. In light of the experiment of\nShibata {\\it et al}. [Nature Nanotech. {\\bf 8}, 723 (2013)] on the magnitude\nand sign of the DMI, our results constitute the first step toward a more\ncomplete understanding of the skyrmion helicity as a new degree of freedom that\ncould be harnessed in future high-density magnetic storage and logic devices.\n", "  Crystals of repulsively interacting ions in planar traps form hexagonal\nlattices, which undergo a buckling instability towards a multi-layer structure\nas the transverse trap frequency is reduced. Numerical and experimental results\nindicate that the new structure is composed of three planes, whose separation\nincreases continuously from zero. We study the effects of thermal and quantum\nfluctuations by mapping this structural instability to the six-state clock\nmodel. A prominent implication of this mapping is that at finite temperature,\nfluctuations split the buckling instability into two thermal transitions,\naccompanied by the appearance of an intermediate critical phase. This phase is\ncharacterized by quasi-long-range order in the spatial tripartite pattern. It\nis manifested by broadened Bragg peaks at new wave vectors, whose line-shape\nprovides a direct measurement of the temperature dependent exponent $\\eta(T)$\ncharacteristic of the power-law correlations in the critical phase. A quantum\nphase transition is found at the largest value of the critical transverse\nfrequency: here the critical intermediate phase shrinks to zero. Moreover,\nwithin the ordered phase, we predict a crossover from classical to quantum\nbehavior, signifying the emergence of an additional characteristic scale for\nclock order. We discuss experimental realizations with trapped ions and\npolarized dipolar gases, and propose that within accessible technology, such\nexperiments can provide a direct probe of the rich phase diagram of the quantum\nclock model, not easily observable in condensed matter analogues. Therefore,\nthis works highlights the potential for ionic and dipolar systems to serve as\nsimulators for complex models in statistical mechanics and condensed matter\nphysics.\n", "  Binary quantum information can be fault tolerantly encoded in states defined\nin infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces. Such states define a computational\nbasis, and permit a perfect equivalence between continuous and discrete\nuniversal operations. The drawback of this encoding is that the corresponding\nlogical states are unphysical, meaning infinitely localized in phase space. We\nuse the modular variables formalism to show that, in a number of protocols\nrelevant for quantum information and for the realization of fundamental tests\nof quantum mechanics, it is possible to loosen the requirements on the logical\nsubspace without jeopardizing their usefulness or their successful\nimplementation. Such protocols involve measurements of appropriately chosen\nmodular observables that permit the readout of the encoded discrete quantum\ninformation from the corresponding logical states. Finally, we demonstrate the\nexperimental feasibility of our approach by applying it to the transverse\ndegrees of freedom of single photons.\n", "  An approach is proposed for evaluating dipolar and multipolar inter-site\ninteractions in strongly correlated materials. This approach is based on the\nsingle-site dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) in conjunction with the atomic\napproximation for the local self-energy. Starting from the local moment\nparamagnetic state described by DMFT we derive inter-site interactions by\nconsidering the response of the DMFT grand potential to small fluctuations of\natomic configurations on two neighboring sites. The present method is validated\nby applying it to one-band and two-band e$_g$ Hubbard models on the\nsimple-cubic 3$d$ lattice. It is also applied to study the spin-orbital order\nin the parent cubic structure of ternary chromium fluoride KCrF$_3$. We obtain\nthe onset of a G-type antiferro-orbital order at a significantly lower\ntemperature compared to that in real distorted KCrF$_3$. In contrast, its\nlayered A-type antiferromagnetic order and N\\'eel temperature are rather well\nreproduced. The calculated full Kugel-Khomskii Hamiltonian contains\nspin-orbital coupling terms inducing a misalignment in the antiferro-orbital\norder upon the onset of antiferromagnetism.\n", "  We consider radial solutions to the Schr\\\"odinger-Poisson system in three\ndimensions with an external smooth potential with Coulomb-like decay. Such a\nsystem can be viewed as a model for the interaction of dark matter with a\nbright matter background in the non-relativistic limit. We find that there are\ninfinitely many critical points of the Hamiltonian, subject to fixed mass, and\nthat these bifurcate from solutions to the associated linear problem at zero\nmass. As a result, each branch has a different topological character defined by\nthe number of zeros of the radial states. We construct numerical approximations\nto these nonlinear states along the first several branches. The solution\nbranches can be continued, numerically, to large mass values, where they become\nasymptotic, under a rescaling, to those of the Schr\\\"odinger-Poisson problem\nwith no external potential. Our numerical computations indicate that the ground\nstate is orbitally stable, while the excited states are linearly unstable for\nsufficiently large mass.\n", "  The spontaneous flapping of a flag can be used to produce electrical energy\nfrom a fluid flow when coupled to a generator. In this paper, the energy\nharvesting performance of a flag covered by a single pair of PVDF piezoelectric\nelectrodes is studied both experimentally and numerically. The electrodes are\nconnected to a resistive-inductive circuit that forms a resonant circuit with\nthe piezoelectric's intrinsic capacitance. Compared with purely resistive\ncircuits, the resonance between the circuit and the flag's flapping motion\nleads to a significant increase in the harvested energy. Our experimental study\nalso validates our fluid-solid-electric nonlinear numerical model.\n", "  Analogously to globular clusters, the dense stellar environment of the\nGalactic center has been proposed to host a large population of as-yet\nundetected millisecond pulsars (MSPs). Recently, this hypothesis found support\nin the analysis of gamma rays from the inner Galaxy seen by the Large Area\nTelescope (LAT) aboard the Fermi satellite, which revealed a possible excess of\ndiffuse GeV photons in the inner 15 deg about the Galactic center (Fermi GeV\nexcess). The excess can be interpreted as the collective emission of thousands\nof MSPs in the Galactic bulge, with a spherical distribution that strongly\npeaks towards the Galactic center. In order to fully establish the MSP\ninterpretation, it is essential to find corroborating evidence in\nmulti-wavelength searches, most notably through the detection of radio\npulsation from individual bulge MSPs. Based on globular cluster observations\nand the gamma-ray emission from the inner Galaxy, we investigate the prospects\nfor detecting MSPs in the Galactic bulge. While previous pulsar surveys failed\nto identify this population, we demonstrate that, in the upcoming years, new\nlarge-area surveys with focus on regions a few degrees north or south of the\nGalactic center should lead to the detection of dozens of bulge MSPs.\nAdditionally, we show that, in the near future, deep targeted searches of\nunassociated Fermi sources should be able to detect the first few MSPs in the\nbulge. The prospects for these deep searches are enhanced by a tentative\ngamma-ray/radio correlation that we infer from high-latitude gamma-ray MSPs.\nSuch detections would constitute the first clear discoveries of field MSPs in\nthe Galactic bulge, with far-reaching implications for gamma-ray observations,\nthe formation history of the central Milky Way and strategy optimization for\nfuture radio observations.\n", "  Spontaneous symmetry breaking is an important concept for understanding\nphysics ranging from the elementary particles to states of matter. For example,\nthe superconducting state breaks global gauge symmetry, and unconventional\nsuperconductors can break additional symmetries. In particular, spin rotational\nsymmetry is expected to be broken in spin-triplet superconductors. However,\nexperimental evidence for such symmetry breaking has not been conclusively\nobtained so far in any candidate compounds. Here, by 77Se nuclear magnetic\nresonance measurements, we show that spin rotation symmetry is spontaneously\nbroken in the hexagonal plane of the electron-doped topological insulator\nCu0.3Bi2Se3 below the superconducting transition temperature Tc=3.4 K. Our\nresults not only establish spin-triplet superconductivity in this compound, but\nmay also serve to lay a foundation for the research of topological\nsuperconductivity.\n", "  The $q$-theory approach to the cosmological constant problem is reconsidered.\nThe new observation is that the effective classical $q$-theory gets modified\ndue to the backreaction of quantum-mechanical particle production by spacetime\ncurvature. Furthermore, a Planck-scale cosmological constant is added to the\npotential term of the action density, in order to represent the effects from\nzero-point energies and phase transitions. The resulting dynamical equations of\na spatially-flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker universe are then found to give a\nsteady approach to the Minkowski vacuum, with attractor behavior for a finite\ndomain of initial boundary conditions on the fields. The approach to the\nMinkowski vacuum is slow and gives rise to an inflation-type increase of the\nparticle horizon.\n", "  This paper investigates the non-equilibrium hydrodynamic behavior of a simple\ntotally asymmetric interacting particle system of particles, antiparticles and\nholes on $\\mathbb{Z}$. Rigorous hydrodynamic results apply to our model with a\nhydrodynamic flux that is exactly calculated and shown to change convexity in\nsome region of the model parameters. We then characterize the entropy solutions\nof the hydrodynamic equation with step initial condition in this scenario which\ninclude various mixtures of rarefaction fans and shock waves. We highlight how\nthe phase diagram of the model changes by varying the model parameters.\n", "  The propagation of intense picosecond laser pulses in air in the presence of\nstrong nonlinear self-action effects and air ionization is investigated\nexperimentally and numerically. The model used for numerical analysis is based\non the nonlinear propagator for the optical field coupled with the rate\nequations for the production of various ionic species and plasma temperature.\nOur results show that the phenomenon of plasma-driven intensity clamping, which\nis paramount in femtosecond laser filamentation, holds for picosecond pulses.\nFurthermore, the temporal pulse distortions are limited and the pulse fluence\nis also clamped. The resulting unique feature of the picosecond filamentation\nregime is the production of a broad, fully ionized air channel, continuous both\nlongitudinally and transversely, which may be instrumental for numerous\napplications.\n", "  We show that the wave function of a one dimensional spinor gas with contact\n$s$-wave interaction, either bosonic or fermionic, can be mapped to the direct\nproduct of the wave function of a spinless Fermi gas with short-range $p$-wave\ninteraction and that of a spin system governed by spin parity projection\noperators. Applying this mapping to strongly interacting spinor gases, we\nobtain a generalized spin chain model that captures both the static and\ndynamics properties of the system. Using this spin chain model, we investigate\nthe breathing mode frequency and the quench dynamics of strongly interacting\nharmonically trapped spinor gases.\n", "  The five-dimensional Ising model with free boundary conditions has recently\nreceived a renewed interest in a debate concerning the finite-size scaling of\nthe susceptibility near the critical temperature. We provide evidence in favour\nof the conventional scaling picture, where the susceptibility scales as\n$O(L^2)$ inside a critical scaling window of width $O(1/L^2)$. Our results are\nbased on Monte Carlo data gathered on system sizes up to $L=79$ (ca. three\nbillion spins) for a wide range of temperatures near the critical point. We\nanalyse the magnetisation distribution, the susceptibility and also the scaling\nand distribution of the size of the Fortuin-Kasteleyn cluster containing the\norigin. The probability of this cluster reaching the boundary determines the\ncorrelation length, and its behaviour agrees with the mean field critical\nexponent $\\delta=3$, that the scaling window has width $O(1/L^2)$.\n", "  An extended ensemble Monte Carlo algorithm is proposed by introducing a\nviolation of the detailed balance condition to the update scheme of the inverse\ntemperature in simulated tempering. Our method, irreversible simulated\ntempering, is constructed based on the framework of the skew detailed balance\ncondition. By applying this method to the ferromagnetic Ising model in two\ndimensions on a square lattice as a benchmark, the dynamical behavior of the\ninverse temperature and an autocorrelation function of the magnetization are\nstudied numerically. It is found that the relaxation dynamics of the inverse\ntemperature changes qualitatively from diffusive to ballistic by violating the\ndetailed balance condition. Consequently, the autocorrelation time of\nmagnetization is several times smaller than that for the conventional algorithm\nsatisfying the detailed balance condition.\n", "  We present a detailed study of the vacua of the $S_3$-symmetric\nthree-Higgs-doublet potential, specifying the region of parameters where these\nminimisation solutions occur. We work with a CP conserving scalar potential and\nanalyse the possible real and complex vacua with emphasis on the cases in which\nthe CP symmetry can be spontaneously broken. Results are presented both in the\nreducible-representation framework of Derman, and in the\nirreducible-representation framework. Mappings between these are given. Some of\nthese implementations can in principle accommodate dark matter and for that\npurpose it is important to identify the residual symmetries of the potential\nafter spontaneous symmetry breakdown. We are also concerned with constraints\nfrom vacuum stability.\n", "  We report on the detection of two O VI absorbers separated in velocity by 710\nkm/s at z ~ 0.4 towards the background quasar SBS0957+599. Both absorbers are\nmultiphase systems tracing substantial reservoirs of warm baryons. The low and\nintermediate ionization metals in the first absorber is consistent with an\norigin in photoionized gas. The O VI has a velocity structure different from\nother metal species. The Ly-alpha shows the presence of a broad feature. The\nline widths for O VI and the broad Ly-alpha suggest T = 7.1 x 10^5 K. This warm\nmedium is probing a baryonic column which is an order of magnitude more than\nthe total hydrogen in the cooler photoionized gas. The second absorber is\ndetected only in H I and O VI. Here the temperature of 4.6 x 10^4 K supports O\nVI originating in a low-density photoionized gas. A broad component is seen in\nthe Ly-alpha, offset from the O VI. The temperature in the broad Ly-alpha is T\n< 2.1 x 10^5 K. The absorbers reside in a galaxy overdensity region with 7\nspectroscopically identified galaxies within ~ 10 Mpc and delta_v ~ 1000 km/s\nof the first absorber, and 2 galaxies inside a similar separation from the\nsecond absorber. The distribution of galaxies relative to the absorbers suggest\nthat the line of sight could be intercepting a large-scale filament connecting\ngalaxy groups, or the extended halo of a sub-L* galaxy. Though kinematically\nproximate, the two absorbers reaffirm the diversity in the physical conditions\nof low redshift O VI systems and the galactic environments they inhabit.\n", "  The inner moons of Jupiter and Saturn migrate outwards due to tidal energy\ndissipation within the planets, the details of which remain poorly understood.\nWe demonstrate that resonance locking between moons and internal oscillation\nmodes of the planet can produce rapid tidal migration. Resonance locking arises\ndue to the internal structural evolution of the planet and typically produces\nan outward migration rate comparable to the age of the solar system. Resonance\nlocking predicts a similar migration timescale but a different effective tidal\nquality factor $Q$ governing the migration of each moon. It also predicts\nnearly constant migration timescales a function of semi-major axis, such that\neffective $Q$ values were larger in the past. Recent measurements of Jupiter\nand Saturn's moon systems find effective $Q$ values that are smaller than\nexpected (and are different between moons), and which correspond to migration\ntimescales of $\\sim$10 Gyr. If confirmed, the measurements are broadly\nconsistent with resonance locking as the dominant source of tidal dissipation\nin Jupiter and Saturn. Resonance locking also provides solutions to several\nproblems posed by current measurements: it naturally explains the exceptionally\nsmall $Q$ governing Rhea's migration, it allows the large heating rate of\nEnceladus to be achieved in an equilibrium eccentricity configuration, and it\nresolves evolutionary problems arising from present-day migration/heating\nrates.\n", "  We present a Fermi golden rule giving rates of decay of states obtained by\nperturbing embedded eigenvalues of a quantum graph. To illustrate the procedure\nin a notationally simpler setting we also present a Fermi Golden Rule for\nboundary value problems on surfaces with constant curvature cusps. We also\nprovide a resonance existence result which is uniform on compact sets of\nenergies and metric graphs. The results are illustrated by numerical\nexperiments.\n", "  Topological operations have the merit of achieving certain goals without\nrequiring accurate control over local operational details. To date, topological\noperations have been used to control geometric phases, and have been proposed\nas a means for controlling the state of certain systems within their degenerate\nsubspaces[1-8]. More recently, it was predicted that topological operations can\nbe extended to transfer energy between normal modes, provided that the system\npossesses a specific type of degeneracy known as an exceptional point\n(EP)[9-11]. Here we demonstrate the transfer of energy between two modes of a\ncryogenic optomechanical device by topological operations. We show that this\ntransfer arises from the presence of an EP in the device's spectrum. We also\nshow that this transfer is non-reciprocal[12-14]. These results open new\ndirections in system control; they also open the possibility of exploring other\ndynamical effects related to EPs[15,16], as well as the behavior of thermal and\nquantum fluctuations in the vicinity of EPs.\n", "  Here we present a model for a small system combined with an explicit entropy\nbath that is comparably small. The dynamics of the model is defined by a simple\nmatrix, M. Each row of M corresponds to a macrostate of the system, e.g. net\nalignment, while the elements in the row represent microstates. The constant\nnumber of elements in each row ensures constant entropy, which allows\nreversible fluctuations, similar to information theory where a constant number\nof bits allows reversible computations. Many elements in M come from the\nmicrostates of the system, but many others come from the bath. Bypassing the\nbath states yields fluctuations that exhibit standard white noise; whereas with\nbath states the power spectral density varies as S(f)~1/f over a wide range of\nfrequencies, f. Thus, the explicit entropy bath is the mechanism of 1/f noise\nin this model. Both forms of the model match Crooks' fluctuation theorem\nexactly, indicating that the theorem applies not only to infinite reservoirs,\nbut also to finite-sized baths. The model is used to analyze measurements of\n1/f-like noise from a sub-micron tunnel junction.\n", "  Dual-comb spectroscopy utilizes two sets of comb lines with slightly\ndifferent comb-tooth-spacings, and optical spectral information is acquired by\nmeasuring the radio-frequency beat notes between the sets of comb lines. It\nholds the promise as a real-time, high-resolution analytical spectroscopy tool\nfor a range of applications. However, the stringent requirement on the\ncoherence between comb lines from two separate lasers and the sophisticated\ncontrol system to achieve that have confined the technology to the top\nmetrology laboratories. By replacing control electronics with an all-optical\ndual-comb lasing scheme, a simplified dual-comb spectroscopy scheme is\ndemonstrated using just one dual-wavelength, passively mode-locked fiber laser.\nDual-comb pulses with a repetition-frequency difference determined by the\nintracavity dispersion are shown to be sufficiently stable against common-mode\ncavity drifts and noises. As sufficiently low relative linewidth is maintained\nbetween two sets of comb lines, capability to resolve RF beat notes between\ncomb teeth and picometer-wide optical spectral features is demonstrated using a\nsimple data acquisition and processing system in an all-fiber setup.\nPossibility to use energy-efficient, free-running fiber lasers with a small\ncomb-tooth-spacing could enable the realization of low-cost dual-comb\nspectroscopy systems affordable to more applications.\n", "  The scattering of 1D matter wave bright solitons on attractive potentials\nenables one to populate bound states, a feature impossible with noninteracting\nwave packets. Compared to noninteracting states, the populated states are\nrenormalized by the attractive interactions between atoms and keep the same\ntopology. This renormalization can even transform a virtual state into a bound\nstate. By switching off adiabatically the interactions, the trapped wave\npackets converge towards the true noninteracting bound states. Our numerical\nstudies show how such scattering experiments can reveal and characterize the\nsurface states of a periodic structure whose translational invariance has been\nbroken. We provide evidence that the corresponding 3D regime should be\naccessible with current techniques.\n", "  We study the effective time evolution of a large quantum system consisting of\na mixture of different species of identical bosons in interaction. If the\nsystem is initially prepared so as to exhibit condensation in each component,\nwe prove that condensation persists at later times and we show quantitatively\nthat the many-body Schr\\\"{o}dinger dynamics is effectively described by a\nsystem of coupled cubic non-linear Schr\\\"{o}dinger equations, one for each\ncomponent.\n", "  We employ the numerical linked-cluster expansion to study finite-temperature\nproperties of the uniform cubic lattice Hubbard model in the thermodynamic\nlimit for a wide range of interaction strengths and densities. We carry out the\nexpansion to the 9th order and find that the convergence of the series extends\nto lower temperatures as the strength of the interaction increases, giving us\naccess to regions of the parameter space that are difficult to reach by most\nother numerical methods. We study the precise trends in the specific heat, the\ndouble occupancy, and magnetic correlations at temperatures as low as 0.2 of\nthe hopping amplitude in the strong-coupling regime. We show that in this\nregime, accurate estimates for transition temperatures to the N\\'{e}el ordered\nphase, in agreement with the predicted asymptotic behavior, can be deduced from\nthe low-temperature magnetic structure factor. We also find evidence for\npossible instability to the magnetically ordered phase away from, but close to,\nhalf filling. Our results have important implications for parametrizing\nfermionic systems in optical lattice experiments and for benchmarking other\nnumerical methods.\n", "  Physical vacuum is a special superfluid medium populated by enormous amount\nof virtual particle-antiparticle pairs. Its motion is described by the modified\nNavier-Stokes equation: (a)~the pressure gradient divided by the mass density\nis replaced by the gradient from the quantum potential; (b)~time-averaged the\nviscosity vanishes, but its variance is not zero. Vortex structures arising in\nthis medium show infinitely long lifetime owing to zero average viscosity. The\nnonzero variance is conditioned by exchanging the vortex energy with zero-point\nvacuum fluctuations. The vortex has a non-zero core where the orbital speed\nvanishes. The speed reaches a maximal value on the core wall and further it\ndecreases monotonically. The vortex trembles around some average value and\npossesses by infinite life time. The vortex ball resulting from topological\ntransformation of the vortex ring is considered as a model of a particle with\nspin. Anomalous magnetic moment of electron is computed.\n", "  In this paper, we prove that the \"conformal collider bounds\" originally\nproposed by Hofman and Maldacena hold for any unitary parity-preserving\nconformal field theory (CFT) with a unique stress tensor in spacetime\ndimensions larger than 2. In particular this implies that the ratio of central\ncharges for a unitary 4d CFT lies in the interval $\\frac{31}{18} \\geq\n\\frac{a}{c} \\geq \\frac{1}{3}$. For superconformal theories this is further\nreduced to $\\frac{3}{2} \\geq \\frac{a}{c} \\geq \\frac{1}{2}$. The proof relies\nonly on CFT first principles - in particular, bootstrap methods - and thus\nconstitutes the first complete field theory proof of these bounds. We further\nelaborate on similar bounds for non-conserved currents and relate them to\nresults obtained recently from deep inelastic scattering.\n", "  The recently reported violation of a Bell inequality using entangled\nelectronic spins in diamonds (Hensen et al., Nature 526, 682-686) provided the\nfirst loophole-free evidence against local-realist theories of nature. Here we\nreport on data from a second Bell experiment using the same experimental setup\nwith minor modifications. We find a violation of the CHSH-Bell inequality of\n$2.35 \\pm 0.18$, in agreement with the first run, yielding an overall value of\n$S = 2.38 \\pm 0.14$. We calculate the resulting $P$-values of the second\nexperiment and of the combined Bell tests. We provide an additional analysis of\nthe distribution of settings choices recorded during the two tests, finding\nthat the observed distributions are consistent with uniform settings for both\ntests. Finally, we analytically study the effect of particular models of random\nnumber generator (RNG) imperfection on our hypothesis test. We find that the\nwinning probability per trial in the CHSH game can be bounded knowing only the\nmean of the RNG bias, implying that our experimental result is robust for any\nmodel underlying the estimated average RNG bias.\n", "  We show the direct analogy between the ghost-free non-linear formulation of\nmassive gravity and the standard $\\sigma$-models well understood in the\nliterature. This issue explains why there are two non-trivial family of\nsolutions for the spherically symmetric case inside the non-linear massive\ngravity formulations with two free-parameters $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$. In general,\nthe case $\\beta<\\alpha^2$ has a single physical vacuum state. On the other\nhand, the case $\\beta=\\alpha^2$ contains a natural vacuum degeneracy. This is\nin perfect analogy with the $\\sigma$-model for scalar fields where depending on\nthe values taken by the parameters of the theory the vacuum can be single or\ndegenerate.\n", "  In this paper, probabilistic shaping is numerically and experimentally\ninvestigated for increasing the transmission reach of wavelength division\nmultiplexed (WDM) optical communication system employing quadrature amplitude\nmodulation (QAM). An optimized probability mass function (PMF) of the QAM\nsymbols is first found from a modified Blahut-Arimoto algorithm for the optical\nchannel. A turbo coded bit interleaved coded modulation system is then applied,\nwhich relies on many-to-one labeling to achieve the desired PMF, thereby\nachieving shaping gain. Pilot symbols at rate at most 2% are used for\nsynchronization and equalization, making it possible to receive input\nconstellations as large as 1024QAM. The system is evaluated experimentally on a\n10 GBaud, 5 channels WDM setup. The maximum system reach is increased w.r.t.\nstandard 1024QAM by 20% at input data rate of 4.65 bits/symbol and up to 75% at\n5.46 bits/symbol. It is shown that rate adaptation does not require changing of\nthe modulation format. The performance of the proposed 1024QAM shaped system is\nvalidated on all 5 channels of the WDM signal for selected distances and rates.\nFinally, it was shown via EXIT charts and BER analysis that iterative\ndemapping, while generally beneficial to the system, is not a requirement for\nachieving the shaping gain.\n", "  We study theoretically spin decoherence and intrinsic spin noise in\nsemiconductor quantum wires caused by an interplay of electron hopping between\nthe localized states and the hyperfine interaction of electron and nuclear\nspins. At a sufficiently low density of localization sites the hopping rates\nhave an exponentially broad distribution. It allows the description of the spin\ndynamics in terms of closely-situated \"pairs\" of sites and single \"reaching\"\nstates, from which the series of hops result in the electron localized inside a\n\"pair\". The developed analytical model and numerical simulations demonstrate\ndisorder-dependent algebraic tails in the spin decay and power-law\nsingularity-like features in the low-frequency part of the spin noise spectrum.\n", "  We investigate the possibility of a Dicke-type superradiant phase transition\nof an atomic gas with an extended model which takes into account the\nshort-range depolarizing interactions between atoms approaching each other as\nclose as the atomic size scale, which interaction appears in a regularized\nelectric-dipole picture of the QED of atoms. By using a mean field model, we\nfind that a critical density does indeed exist, though the atom-atom contact\ninteraction shifts it to a higher value than it can be obtained from the bare\nDicke-model. We argue that the system, at the critical density, transitions to\nthe condensed rather than the \"superradiant\" phase.\n", "  Digital signatures guarantee the authorship of electronic communications.\nCurrently used \"classical\" signature schemes rely on unproven computational\nassumptions for security, while quantum signatures rely only on the laws of\nquantum mechanics. Previous quantum signature schemes have used unambiguous\nquantum measurements. Such measurements, however, sometimes give no result,\nreducing the efficiency of the protocol. Here, we instead use heterodyne\ndetection, which always gives a result, although there is always some\nuncertainty. We experimentally demonstrate feasibility in a real environment by\ndistributing signature states through a noisy 1.6km free-space channel. Our\nresults show that continuous-variable heterodyne detection improves the\nsignature rate for this type of scheme and therefore represents an interesting\ndirection in the search for practical quantum signature schemes.\n", "  Molecular communication is an emerging paradigm for systems that rely on the\nrelease of molecules as information carriers. Communication via molecular\ndiffusion is a popular strategy that is ubiquitous in nature and very fast over\ndistances on the order of a micron or less. Existing closed-form analysis of\nthe diffusion channel impulse response generally assumes that the transmitter\nis a point source. In this paper, channel impulse responses are derived for\nspherical transmitters with either a passive or absorbing receiver. The derived\nchannel impulse responses are in closed-form for a one-dimensional environment\nand can be found via numerical integration for a three-dimensional environment.\nThe point transmitter assumption (PTA) is formally defined so that its accuracy\ncan be measured in comparison to the derived spherical transmitter impulse\nresponses. The spherical transmitter model is much more accurate than the PTA\nwhen the distance between a transmitter and its receiver is small relative to\nthe size of the transmitter. The derived results are verified via microscopic\nparticle-based simulations using the molecular communication simulation\nplatform AcCoRD (Actor-based Communication via Reaction-Diffusion). A spherical\ntransmitter variation where molecules are released from the surface of a solid\nsphere is also considered via simulation.\n", "  Dual-comb lasers from which asynchronous ultrashort pulses can be\nsimultaneously generated have recently become an interesting research subject.\nThey could be an intriguing alternative to the current dual-laser\noptical-frequency-comb source with highly sophisticated electronic control\nsystems. If generated through a common light path traveled by all pulses, the\ncommon-mode noises between the spectral lines of different pulse trains could\nbe significantly reduced. Therefore, coherent dual-comb generation from a\ncompletely common-path, unidirectional lasing cavity would be an interesting\nterritory to explore. In this paper, we demonstrate such a dual-comb lasing\nscheme based on a nanomaterial saturable absorber with additional pulse\nnarrowing and broadening mechanisms concurrently introduced into a mode-locked\nfiber laser. The interactions between multiple soliton formation mechanisms\nresult in unusual bifurcation into two-pulse states with quite different\ncharacteristics. Simultaneous oscillation of pulses with four-fold difference\nin pulsewidths and tens of Hz repetition rate difference is observed. The\ncoherence between these spectral-overlapped, picosecond and femtosecond pulses\nis further verified by the corresponding asynchronous cross-sampling and\ndual-comb spectroscopy measurements.\n", "  One drawback of conventional quantum state tomography is that it does not\nreadily provide access to single density matrix elements, since it requires a\nglobal reconstruction. Here we experimentally demonstrate a scheme that can be\nused to directly measure individual density matrix elements of general quantum\nstates. The scheme relies on measuring a sequence of three observables, each\ncomplementary to the last. The first two measurements are made weak to minimize\nthe disturbance they cause to the state, while the final measurement is strong.\nWe perform this joint measurement on polarized photons in pure and mixed states\nto directly measure their density matrix. The weak measurements are achieved\nusing two walk-off crystals, each inducing a polarization-dependent spatial\nshift that couples the spatial and polarization degree of freedom of the\nphotons. This direct measurement method provides an operational meaning to the\ndensity matrix and promises to be especially useful for large dimensional\nstates.\n", "  The sums over (e,e') spectra of 6Li and 7Li nuclei which correspond to the\nlongitudinal sum rule are studied. It is suggested that due to the cluster\nstructure of the lithium isotopes these sums may approximately be expressed in\nterms of such a sum pertaining to the alpha-particle. Calculation of these sums\nis performed in the framework of cluster models with antisymmetrization done\nwith respect to all the nucleons. At momentum transfers higher than 0.8 fm^{-1}\nthe relations expressing the A=6 or 7 sum in terms of the A=4 sum prove to be\nvalid with rather high accuracy. In the region of momentum transfers around 1\nfm^{-1} the longitudinal correlation functions of 6Li and 7Li nuclei are found\nto be close to that of the alpha-particle. The experimental longitudinal sums\nin the range between 0.450 and 1.625 fm^{-1} are employed to perform comparison\nwith those calculated in the framework of cluster models. Out of the mentioned\nexperimental sums, those in the range between 0.750 and 1.000 fm^{-1} in the\n6Li case and between 0.750 and 1.125 fm^{-1} in the 7Li case are obtained in\nthe present work. In the 6Li case a complete agreement is found while in the\n7Li case an agreement only at a qualitative level is observed.\n", "  We investigate a two-level atom in the field of a strong laser pulse. The\nresulting time-dependent polarization is the source of a radiation the\nfrequency components of which are essentially harmonics of the driving field's\ncarrier frequency. The time evolution of this secondary radiation is analyzed\nin terms of the expectation values of the photon number operators for a large\nnumber of electromagnetic modes that are initially in the vacuum state. Our\nmethod is based on a multimode version of the Jaynes-Cummings-Paul model and\ncan be generalized to different radiating systems as well. We show, that after\nthe exciting pulse, the final distribution of the photon numbers is close to\nthe conventional (Fourier transform-based) power spectrum of the secondary\nradiation. The details of the high harmonic spectra are also analyzed, for\nmany-cycle excitations a clear physical interpretation can be given in terms of\nthe Floquet quasi-energies. A first step towards the determination of the\nphoton statistics of the HHG modes reveals states with slightly\nsuper-Poissonian distribution.\n", "  We propose a new physical interpretation of the Diophantine equation of\n$\\sigma_{xy}$ for the Hofstadter problem. First, we divide the energy spectrum,\nor Hofstadter's butterfly, into smaller self-similar areas called \"subcells\",\nwhich were first introduced by Hofstadter to describe the recursive structure.\nWe find that in the energy gaps between subcells, there are two ways to account\nfor the quantization rule of $\\sigma_{xy}$, that are consistent with the\nDiophantine equation: Landau quantization of (i) massless Dirac fermions or\n(ii) free fermions in Hofstadter's butterfly.\n", "  We present improved pQCD predictions for Higgs boson hadroproduction at the\nLarge Hadronic Collider (LHC) by applying the Principle of Maximum Conformality\n(PMC), a procedure which resums the pQCD series using the renormalization group\n(RG), thereby eliminating the dependence of the predictions on the choice of\nthe renormalization scheme while minimizing sensitivity to the initial choice\nof the renormalization scale. In previous pQCD predictions for Higgs boson\nhadroproduction, it has been conventional to assume that the renormalization\nscale $\\mu_r$ of the QCD coupling $\\alpha_s(\\mu_r)$ is the Higgs mass, and then\nto vary this choice over the range $1/2 m_H < \\mu_r < 2 m_H $ in order to\nestimate the theory uncertainty. However, this error estimate is only sensitive\nto the non-conformal $\\beta$ terms in the pQCD series, and thus it fails to\ncorrectly estimate the theory uncertainty in cases where pQCD series has large\nhigher order contributions, as is the case for Higgs boson hadroproduction.\nFurthermore, this \\mbox{\\it ad hoc} choice of scale and range gives pQCD\npredictions which depend on the renormalization scheme being used, in\ncontradiction to basic RG principles. In contrast, after applying the PMC, we\nobtain next-to-next-to-leading order RG resummed pQCD predictions for Higgs\nboson hadroproduction which are renormalization-scheme independent and have\nminimal sensitivity to the choice of the initial renormalization scale. Taking\n$m_H=125$ GeV, the PMC predictions for the $p p \\to H X$ Higgs inclusive\nhadroproduction cross-sections for various LHC center-of-mass energies and the\nfiducial cross section $\\sigma_{\\rm fid}(pp\\to H\\to\\gamma\\gamma)$ are\npresented...... The PMC predictions show better agreement with the ATLAS\nmeasurements than the LHC-XS predictions which are based on conventional\nrenormalization scale-setting.\n", "  We present a comprehensive comparison of the available experimental data for\nthe Drell-Yan lepton angular coefficients $\\lambda$ and $\\nu$ to calculations\nat leading and next-to-leading order of perturbative QCD. To obtain the\nnext-to-leading order corrections, we make use of publicly available numerical\ncodes that allow us to compute the Drell-Yan cross section at second order in\nperturbation theory and from which the contributions we need can be extracted.\nOur comparisons reveal that perturbative QCD is able to describe the\nexperimental data overall rather well, especially at colliders, but also in the\nfixed-target regime. On the basis of the angular coefficients alone, there\nappears to be little (if any) convincing evidence for effects that go beyond\nfixed-order collinear factorized perturbation theory, although the presence of\nsuch effects is not ruled out.\n", "  A new scalar boson which couples to the muon and proton can simultaneously\nsolve the proton radius puzzle and the muon anomalous magnetic moment\ndiscrepancy. Using a variety of measurements, we constrain the mass of this\nscalar and its couplings to the electron, muon, neutron, and proton. Making no\nassumptions about the underlying model, these constraints and the requirement\nthat it solve both problems limit the mass of the scalar to between about 100\nkeV and 100 MeV. We identify two unexplored regions in the coupling\nconstant-mass plane. Potential future experiments and their implications for\ntheories with mass-weighted lepton couplings are discussed.\n", "  Within a dense environment ($\\rho \\approx 10^{14}\\,$atoms/cm$^3$) at\nultracold temperatures ($T < 1\\,\\mu{}\\text{K}$), a single atom excited to a\nRydberg state acts as a reaction center for surrounding neutral atoms. At these\ntemperatures almost all neutral atoms within the Rydberg orbit are bound to the\nRydberg core and interact with the Rydberg atom. We have studied the reaction\nrate and products for $nS$ $^{87}$Rb Rydberg states and we mainly observe a\nstate change of the Rydberg electron to a high orbital angular momentum $l$,\nwith the released energy being converted into kinetic energy of the Rydberg\natom. Unexpectedly, the measurements show a threshold behavior at $n\\approx\n100$ for the inelastic collision time leading to increased lifetimes of the\nRydberg state independent of the densities investigated. Even at very high\ndensities ($\\rho\\approx4.8\\times 10^{14}\\,\\text{cm}^{-3}$), the lifetime of a\nRydberg atom exceeds $10\\,\\mu\\text{s}$ at $n > 140$ compared to\n$1\\,\\mu\\text{s}$ at $n=90$. In addition, a second observed reaction mechanism,\nnamely Rb$_2^+$ molecule formation, was studied. Both reaction products are\nequally probable for $n=40$ but the fraction of Rb$_2^+$ created drops to below\n10$\\,$% for $n\\ge90$.\n", "  Swarming behavior continues to be a subject of immense interest because of\nits centrality in many naturally occurring systems in physics and biology, as\nwell as its importance in applications such as robotics. Here we examine the\neffects on swarm pattern formation from delayed communication and topological\nheterogeneity, and in particular, the inclusion of a relatively small number of\nhighly connected nodes, or \"motherships\", in a swarm's communication network.\nWe find generalized forms of basic patterns for networks with general degree\ndistributions, and a variety of new behaviors including new parameter regions\nwith multi-stability and hybrid motions in bimodal networks. The latter is an\ninteresting example of how heterogeneous networks can have dynamics that is a\nmix of different states in homogeneous networks, where high and low-degree\nnodes have simultaneously distinct behavior.\n", "  We investigate bright solitons in the one-dimensional Schr\\\"odinger equation\nin the framework of an extended variational approach. We apply the latter to\nthe stationary ground state of the system as well as to coherent collisions\nbetween two or more solitons. Using coupled Gaussian trial wave functions, we\ndemonstrate that the variational approach is a powerful method to calculate the\nsoliton dynamics. This method has the advantage that it is computationally\nfaster compared to numerically exact grid calculations. In addition, it goes\nfar beyond the capability of analytical ground state solutions, because the\nvariational approach provides the ability to treat excited solitons as well as\ndynamical interactions between different wave packets. To demonstrate the power\nof the variational approach, we calculate the stationary ground state of the\nsoliton and compare it with the analytical solution showing the convergence to\nthe exact solution. Furthermore, we extend our calculations to nonstationary\nsolitons by investigating the breathing oscillations of excited solitons and\nthe coherent collisions of several wave packets in both the low- and\nhigh-energy regime. Comparisons of the variational approach with numerically\nexact simulations on grids reveal excellent agreement in the high-energy regime\nwhile deviations can be observed for low energies.\n", "  The Open Science Collaboration recently reported that 36% of published\nfindings from psychological studies were reproducible by independent\nresearchers. We can use this information together with Bayes theorem to\nestimate the statistical power needed to produce these findings under various\nassumptions and calculate the expected distribution of positive and negative\nevidence for a range of prior probabilities of the tested hypotheses; and by\ncomparing this distribution to other findings indicating that >90% of\npublications in the psychological literature are statistically significant in\nsupport of the authors hypothesis, we can estimate the magnitude of publication\nbias. The results indicate that negative evidence was observed 30--200 times\nbefore one was published.\n", "  We consider the Wigner quasi-probability distribution function of a single\nmode of an electromagnetic or matter-wave field to address the question of\nwhether a direct stochastic sampling and binning of the absolute square of the\ncomplex field amplitude can yield a distribution function $\\tilde{P}_n$ that\nclosely approximates the true particle number probability distribution $P_n$ of\nthe underlying quantum state. By providing an operational definition of the\nbinned distribution $\\tilde{P}_n$ in terms of the Wigner function, we\nexplicitly calculate the overlap between $\\tilde{P}_n$ and ${P}_n$ and hence\nquantify the statistical distance between the two distributions. We find that\nthere is indeed a close quantitative correspondence between $\\tilde{P}_n$ and\n$P_n$ for a wide range of quantum states that have smooth and broad Wigner\nfunction relative to the scale of oscillations of the Wigner function for the\nrelevant Fock state. However, we also find counterexamples, including states\nwith high mode occupation, for which $\\tilde{P}_n$ does not closely approximate\n$P_n$.\n", "  We study the electrical conductivity of finite-temperature crust of a warm\ncompact star which may be formed in the aftermath of a supernova explosion or a\nbinary neutron star merger as well as when a cold neutron star is heated by\naccretion of material from a companion. We focus on the temperature-density\nregime where plasma is in the liquid state and, therefore, the conductivity is\ndominated by the electron scattering off correlated nuclei. The dynamical\nscreening of this interaction is implemented in terms of the polarization\ntensor computed in the hard-thermal-loop effective field theory of QED plasma.\nThe correlations of the background ionic component are accounted for via a\nstructure factor derived from Monte Carlo simulations of one-component plasma.\nWith this input we solve the Boltzmann kinetic equation in relaxation time\napproximation taking into account the anisotropy of transport due to the\nmagnetic field. The electrical conductivity tensor is studied numerically as a\nfunction of temperature and density for carbon and iron nuclei as well as\ndensity-dependent composition of zero-temperature dense matter in weak\nequilibrium with electrons. We also provide accurate fit formulas to our\nnumerical results as well as supplemental tables which can be used in\ndissipative magneto-hydrodynamics simulations of warm compact stars.\n", "  We present the quantum theory of the measurement of bosonic particles by\nmultipixel detectors. For the sake of clarity, we specialize on beams of\nphotons. We study the measurement of different spatial beam characteristics, as\nposition and width. The limits of these measurements are set by the quantum\nnature of the light field. We investigate how both, detector imperfections and\nfinite pixel size affect the photon counting distribution. An analytic theory\nfor the discretized measurement scheme is derived. We discuss the results and\ncompare them to the theory presented by Chille et al. in \"Quantum uncertainty\nin the beam width of spatial optical modes,\" Opt. Express 23, 32777 (2015),\nwhich investigates the beam width noise independently of the measurement\nsystem. Finally, we present numerical simulations which furnish realistic and\npromising predictions for possible experimental studies.\n", "  We study a Skyrme-like model with the Skyrme term and a sixth-order\nderivative term as higher-order terms, coupled to gravity and we construct\nSchwarzschild black hole Skyrme hair. We find, surprisingly, that the\nsixth-order derivative term alone cannot stabilize the black hole hair\nsolutions; the Skyrme term with a large enough coefficient is a necessity.\n", "  With the widespread use of mobile computing devices in contemporary society,\nour trajectories in the physical space and virtual world are increasingly\nclosely connected. Using the anonymous smartphone data of $1 \\times 10^5$ users\nin 30 days, we constructed the mobility network and the attention network to\nstudy the correlations between online and offline human behaviours. In the\nmobility network, nodes are physical locations and edges represent the\nmovements between locations, and in the attention network, nodes are websites\nand edges represent the switch of users between websites. We apply the\nbox-covering method to renormalise the networks. The investigated network\nproperties include the size of box $l_B$ and the number of boxes $N(l_B)$. We\nfind two universal classes of behaviours: the mobility network is featured by a\nsmall-world property, $N(l_B) \\simeq e^{-l_B}$, whereas the attention network\nis characterised by a self-similar property $N(l_B) \\simeq l_B^{-\\gamma}$. In\nparticular, with the increasing of the length of box $l_B$, the degree\ncorrelation of the network changes from positive to negative which indicates\nthat there are two layers of structure in the mobility network. We use the\nresults of network renormalisation to detect the community and map the\nstructure of the mobility network. Further, we located the most relevant\nwebsites visited in these communities, and identified three typical\nlocation-based behaviours, including the shopping, dating, and taxi-calling.\nFinally, we offered a revised geometric network model to explain our findings\nin the perspective of spatial-constrained attachment.\n", "  Higher order quark effective interactions are found for SU(2) flavor by\ndeparting from a non local quark-quark interaction. By integrating out a\ncomponent of the quark field, the determinant is expanded in chirally symmetric\nand symmetry breaking effective interactions up to the fifh order in the quark\nbilinears. The resulting coupling constants are resolved in the leading order\nof the longwavelength limit and exact numerical ratios between several of these\ncoupling constants are obtained in the large quark mass limit. In this level,\nchiral invariant interactions only show up in even powers of the quark\nbilinears, i.e. ${\\cal O}(\\bar{\\psi} \\psi)^{2 n}$ ($n=1,2,3,..$), whereas\n(explicit) chiral symmetry breaking terms emerge as ${\\cal O}(\\bar{\\psi}\n\\psi)^{n}$ being always proportional to some power of the Lagrangian quark\nmass.\n", "  We report critical current density ($J_c$) in tetragonal FeS single crystals,\nsimilar to iron based superconductors with much higher superconducting critical\ntemperatures ($T_{c}$'s). The $J_c$ is enhanced 3 times by 6\\% Se doping. We\nobserve scaling of the normalized vortex pinning force as a function of reduced\nfield at all temperatures. Vortex pinning in FeS and FeS$_{0.94}$Se$_{0.06}$\nshows contribution of core-normal surface-like pinning. Reduced temperature\ndependence of $J_c$ indicates that dominant interaction of vortex cores and\npinning centers is via scattering of charge carriers with reduced mean free\npath ($\\delta$$l$), in contrast to K$_x$Fe$_{2-y}$Se$_2$ where spatial\nvariations in $T_{c}$ ($\\delta$$T_{c}$) prevails.\n", "  Two dimensional electron gases (2DEGs) at surfaces and interfaces of\nsemiconductors are described straightforwardly with a 1D self-consistent\nPoisson-Schr\\\"{o}dinger scheme. However, their band energies have not been\nmodeled correctly in this way. Using angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy\nwe study the band structures of 2DEGs formed at sulfur-passivated surfaces of\nInAs(001) as a model system. Electronic properties of these surfaces are tuned\nby changing the S coverage, while keeping a high-quality interface, free of\ndefects and with a constant doping density. In contrast to earlier studies we\nshow that the Poisson-Schr\\\"{o}dinger scheme predicts the 2DEG bands energies\ncorrectly but it is indispensable to take into account the existence of the\nphysical surface. The surface substantially influences the band energies beyond\nsimple electrostatics, by setting nontrivial boundary conditions for 2DEG\nwavefunctions.\n", "  We study a two dimensional dilaton gravity system, recently examined by\nAlmheiri and Polchinski, which describes near extremal black holes, or more\ngenerally, nearly $AdS_2$ spacetimes. The asymptotic symmetries of $AdS_2$ are\nall the time reparametrizations of the boundary. These symmetries are\nspontaneously broken by the $AdS_2$ geometry and they are explicitly broken by\nthe small deformation away from $AdS_2$. This pattern of spontaneous plus\nexplicit symmetry breaking governs the gravitational backreaction of the\nsystem. It determines several gravitational properties such as the linear in\ntemperature dependence of the near extremal entropy as well as the\ngravitational corrections to correlation functions. These corrections include\nthe ones determining the growth of out of time order correlators that is\nindicative of chaos. These gravitational aspects can be described in terms of a\nSchwarzian derivative effective action for a reparametrization.\n", "  A fully-antisymmetrized random phase approximation calculation employing the\ncontinued fraction technique is performed to study nuclear matter response\nfunctions with the finite range Gogny force. The most commonly used parameter\nsets of this force, as well as some recent generalizations that include the\ntensor terms are considered and the corresponding response functions are shown.\nThe calculations are performed at the first and second order in the continued\nfraction expansion and the explicit expressions for the second order tensor\ncontributions are given. Comparison between first and second order continued\nfraction expansion results are provided. The differences between the responses\nobtained at the two orders turn to be more pronounced for the forces including\ntensor terms than for the standard Gogny ones. In the vector channels the\nresponses calculated with Gogny forces including tensor terms are characterized\nby a large heterogeneity, reflecting the different choices for the tensor part\nof the interaction. For sake of comparison the response functions obtained\nconsidering a G-matrix based nuclear interaction are also shown. As first\napplication of the present calculation, the possible existence of spurious\nfinite-size instabilities of the Gogny forces with or without tensor terms has\nbeen investigated. The positive conclusion is that all the Gogny forces, but\nthe GT2 one, are free of spurious finite-size instabilities. In perspective,\nthe tool developed in the present paper can be inserted in the fitting\nprocedure to construct new Gogny-type forces.\n", "  Long Josephson tunnel junction are non-linear transmission lines that allow\npropagation of current vortices (fluxons) and electromagnetic waves and are\nused in various applications within superconductive electronics. Recently, the\nJosephson vortex has been proposed as a new superconducting qubit. We describe\na simple method to create a double-well potential for an individual fluxon\ntrapped in a long elliptic annular Josephson tunnel junction characterized by\nan intrinsic non-uniform width. The distance between the potential wells and\nthe height of the inter-well potential barrier are controlled by the strength\nof an in-plane magnetic field. The manipulation of the vortex states can be\nachieved by applying a proper current ramp across the junction. The read-out of\nthe state is accomplished by measuring the vortex depinning current in a small\nmagnetic field. An accurate one-dimensional sine-Gordon model for this strongly\nnon-linear system is presented, from which we calculate the position-dependent\nfluxon rest-mass, its Hamiltonian density and the corresponding trajectories in\nthe phase space. We examine the dependence of the potential properties on the\nannulus eccentricity and its electrical parameters and address the requirements\nfor observing quantum-mechanical effects, as discrete energy levels and\ntunneling, in this two-state system.\n", "  An all-fiber, micro-pulse and eye-safe high spectral resolution wind lidar\n(HSRWL) at 1550nm is proposed and demonstrated by using a pair of upconversion\nsingle-photon detectors and a fiber Fabry-Perot scanning interferometer\n(FFP-SI). In order to improve the optical detection efficiency, both the\ntransmission spectrum and the reflection spectrum of the FFP-SI are used for\nspectral analyses of the aerosol backscatter and the reference laser pulse. The\nreference signal is tapped from the outgoing laser and served as a zero\nvelocity indicator. The Doppler shift is retrieved from a frequency response\nfunction Q, which is defined as the ratio of difference of the transmitted\nsignal and the reflected signal to their sum. Taking advantages of high\nsignal-to-noise ratio of the detectors and high spectral resolution of the\nFFP-SI, the Q spectra of the aerosol backscatter are reconstructed along the\nline-of-sight (LOS) of the telescope. By applying a least squares fit procedure\nto the measured Q spectra, the center frequencies and the bandwidths are\nobtained simultaneously. And then the Doppler shifts are determined relative to\nthe center frequency of the reference signal. To eliminate the influence of\ntemperature fluctuations on the FFP-SI, the FFP-SI is cased in a chamber with\ntemperature stability of 0.001 during the measurement. Continuous LOS wind\nobservations are carried out on two days at Hefei (31.843 N, 117.265 E), China.\nIn the meantime, LOS wind measurements from the HSRWL show good agreement with\nthe results from an ultrasonic wind sensor (Vaisala windcap WMT52). Due to the\ncomputational expensive of the convolution operation of the Q function, an\nempirical method is adopted to evaluate the quality of the measurements. The\nstandard deviation of the wind speed is 0.76 m/s at the 1.8 km. The standard\ndeviation of the retrieved bandwidth variation is 2.07 MHz at the 1.8 km.\n", "  In this article the energy transfer between a flow and a fluttering\npiezoelectric plate is investigated. In particular, the benefits of the use of\na Synchronized Switch Harvesting on Inductor (SSHI) circuit are studied. Both\nwind tunnel experiments and numerical simulations are conducted in order to\nanalyse the influence of the switching process on the dynamics and the\nefficiency of the system. Numerical simulations consist of a weakly non-linear\nmodel of a plate in axial flow equipped with a single pair of piezoelectric\npatches, discretized using a Galerkin method where basis functions are the\nmodes of the plate in vacuum. The discretized model is then integrated in time.\nThe results presented in this paper show that a significant improvement of the\nharvested energy can be obtained using SSHI circuits compared to basic\nresistive circuits. It is also shown that for strongly coupled systems, the\nswitching process inherent to he SSHI circuit has a significant impact on the\ndynamics of the flag, which tends to decrease the relative efficiency gain.\n", "  Hydrodynamic coupling of flexible flags in axial flows may profoundly\ninfluence their flapping dynamics, in particular driving their synchronization.\nThis work investigates the effect of such coupling on the harvesting efficiency\nof coupled piezoelectric flags, that convert their periodic deformation into an\nelectrical current. Considering two flags connected to a single output circuit,\nwe investigate using numerical simulations the relative importance of\nhydrodynamic coupling to electrodynamic coupling of the flags through the\noutput circuit due to the inverse piezoelectric effect. It is shown that\nelectrodynamic coupling is dominant beyond a critical distance, and induces a\nsynchronization of the flags' motion resulting in enhanced energy harvesting\nperformance. We further show that this electrodynamic coupling can be\nstrengthened using resonant harvesting circuits.\n", "  The Gerasimova-Zatsepin effect of collisions of ultra-high-energy cosmic ray\nnuclei with photons emitted by the sun may cause two simultaneous air showers\non Earth. This effect is simulated using the full energy spectrum of solar\nphotons, ray tracing through the interplanetary magnetic field and upper limit\nvalues for the iron and oxygen cosmic ray fluxes. Only the most abundant\ninteractions in which a single proton is emitted from the nucleus are\nconsidered. For the first time the distributions of distances between the\nindividual showers at Earth as a function of the distance of the primary cosmic\nray to the Sun are shown. These distributions are used to estimate the\ncapabilities of current detector arrays to measure the Gerasimova-Zatsepin\neffect and to show that a dedicated array is capable of measuring this effect.\n", "  The interactions and synchronization of two parallel and slender flags in a\nuniform axial flow are studied in the present paper by generalizing Lighthill's\nElongated Body Theory (EBT) and Lighthill's Large Amplitude Elongated Body\nTheory (LAEBT) to account for the hydrodynamic coupling between flags. The\nproposed method consists in two successive steps, namely the reconstruction of\nthe flow created by a flapping flag within the LAEBT framework and the\ncomputation of the fluid force generated by this nonuniform flow on the second\nflag. In the limit of slender flags in close proximity, we show that the effect\nof the wakes have little influence on the long time coupled-dynamics and can be\nneglected in the modeling. This provides a simplified framework extending LAEBT\nto the coupled dynamics of two flags. Using this simplified model, both linear\nand large amplitude results are reported to explore the selection of the\nflapping regime as well as the dynamical properties of two side-by-side slender\nflags. Hydrodynamic coupling of the two flags is observed to destabilize the\nflags for most parameters, and to induce a long-term synchronization of the\nflags, either in-phase or out-of-phase.\n", "  The dynamics of individual liquid plugs pushed at constant pressure head\ninside prewetted cylindrical capillary tubes is investigated experimentally and\ntheoretically. It is shown that, depending on the thickness of the prewetting\nfilm and the magnitude of the pressure head, the plugs can either experience a\ncontinuous acceleration leading to a dramatic decrease of their size and\neventually their rupture or conversely, a progressive deceleration associated\nwith their growth and an exacerbation of the airway obstruction. These\nbehaviors are quantitatively reproduced with a simple nonlinear model [Baudoin\net al., Proc. Nat. Ac. Sci. USA, 2013, 110, 859] adapted here for cylindrical\nchannels. Furthermore, an analytical criterion for the transition between these\ntwo regimes is derived and successfully compared with extensive experimental\ndata. The potential implications of this work for pulmonary obstructive\ndiseases are discussed.\n", "  The Lie-group-based symmetry analysis, as first proposed in Avsarkisov et al.\n(2014) and then later modified in Oberlack et al. (2015), to generate invariant\nsolutions in order to predict the scaling behavior of a channel flow with\nuniform wall transpiration, is revisited. By focusing first on the results\nobtained in Avsarkisov et al. (2014), we failed to reproduce two key results:\n(i) For different transpiration rates at a constant Reynolds number, the mean\nvelocity profiles (in deficit form) do not universally collapse onto a single\ncurve as claimed. (ii) The universally proposed logarithmic scaling law in the\ncenter of the channel does not match the direct numerical simulation (DNS) data\nfor the presented parameter values. In fact, no universal scaling behavior in\nthe center of the channel can be detected from their DNS data, as it is\nmisleadingly claimed in Avsarkisov et al. (2014). Moreover, we will demonstrate\nthat the assumption of a Reynolds-number independent symmetry analysis is not\njustified for the flow conditions considered therein. Only when including also\nthe viscous terms, an overall consistent symmetry analysis can be provided.\nThis has been attempted in their subsequent study Oberlack et al. (2015). But,\nalso the (viscous) Lie-group-based scaling theory proposed therein is\ninconsistent, apart from the additional fact that this study of Oberlack et al.\n(2015) is also technically flawed. The reason for this permanent inconsistency\nis that their symmetry analysis constantly involves several unphysical\nstatistical symmetries that are incompatible to the underlying deterministic\ndescription of Navier-Stokes turbulence.\n", "  We experimentally study resonant interactions of oblique surface gravity\nwaves in a large basin. Our results strongly extend previous experimental\nresults performed mainly for perpendicular or collinear wave trains. We\ngenerate two oblique waves crossing at an acute angle, while we control their\nfrequency ratio, steepnesses and directions. These mother waves mutually\ninteract and give birth to a resonant wave whose properties (growth rate,\nresonant response curve and phase locking) are fully characterized. All our\nexperimental results are found in good quantitative agreement with four-wave\ninteraction theory with no fitting parameter. Off-resonance experiments are\nalso reported and the relevant theoretical analysis is conducted and validated.\n", "  Statistical properties of turbulent Rayleigh-Benard convection at low Prandtl\nnumbers (Pr), which are typical for liquid metals such as mercury, gallium or\nliquid sodium, are investigated in high-resolution three-dimensional spectral\nelement simulations in a closed cylindrical cell with an aspect ratio of one\nand are compared to previous turbulent convection simulations in air. We\ncompare the scaling of global momentum and heat transfer. The scaling exponents\nare found to be in agreement with experiments. Mean profiles of the\nroot-mean-square velocity as well as the thermal and kinetic energy dissipation\nrates have growing amplitudes with decreasing Prandtl number which underlies a\nmore vigorous bulk turbulence in the low-Pr regime. The skin-friction\ncoefficient displays a Reynolds-number dependence that is close to that of an\nisothermal, intermittently turbulent velocity boundary layer. The thermal\nboundary layer thicknesses are larger as Pr decreases and conversely the\nvelocity boundary layer thicknesses become smaller. We investigate the scaling\nexponents and find a slight decrease in exponent magnitude for the thermal\nboundary layer thickness as Pr decreases, but find the opposite case for the\nvelocity boundary layer thickness scaling. A growing area fraction of turbulent\npatches close to the heating and cooling plates can be detected by exceeding a\nlocally defined shear Reynolds number threshold. This area fraction is larger\nfor lower Pr at the same Ra. Our analysis of the kurtosis of the locally\ndefined shear Reynolds number demonstrates that the intermittency in the\nboundary layer is significantly increased for the lower Prandtl number and for\nsufficiently high Rayleigh number compared to convection in air. This\ncomplements our previous findings of enhanced bulk intermittency in\nlow-Prandtl-number convection.\n", "  Studying the average properties of galaxies at a fixed comoving number\ndensity over a wide redshift range has become a popular observational method,\nbecause it may trace the evolution of galaxies statistically. We test this\nmethod by comparing the evolution of galaxies at fixed number density and by\nfollowing individual galaxies through cosmic time (z=0-5) in cosmological,\nhydrodynamical simulations from OWLS. Comparing progenitors, descendants, and\ngalaxies selected at fixed number density at each redshift, we find differences\nof up to a factor of three for galaxy and interstellar medium (ISM) masses. The\ndifference is somewhat larger for black hole masses. The scatter in ISM mass\nincreases significantly towards low redshift with all selection techniques. We\nuse the fixed number density technique to study the assembly of dark matter,\ngas, stars, and black holes and the evolution in accretion and star formation\nrates. We find three different regimes for massive galaxies, consistent with\nobservations: at high redshift the gas accretion rate dominates, at\nintermediate redshifts the star formation rate is the highest, and at low\nredshift galaxies grow mostly through mergers. Quiescent galaxies have much\nlower ISM masses (by definition) and much higher black hole masses, but the\nstellar and halo masses are fairly similar. Without active galactic nucleus\n(AGN) feedback, massive galaxies are dominated by star formation down to z=0\nand most of their stellar mass growth occurs in the centre. With AGN feedback,\nstellar mass is only added to the outskirts of galaxies by mergers and they\ngrow inside-out.\n", "  Social media content shared today in cities, such as Instagram images, their\ntags and descriptions, is the key form of contemporary city life. It tells\npeople where activities and locations that interest them are and it allows them\nto share their urban experiences and self-representations. Therefore, any\nanalysis of urban structures and cultures needs to consider social media\nactivity. In our paper, we introduce the novel concept of social media\ninequality. This concept allows us to quantitatively compare patterns in social\nmedia activities between parts of a city, a number of cities, or any other\nspatial areas. We define this concept using an analogy with the concept of\neconomic inequality. Economic inequality indicates how some economic\ncharacteristics or material resources, such as income, wealth or consumption\nare distributed in a city, country or between countries. Accordingly, we can\ndefine social media inequality as the measure of the distribution of\ncharacteristics from social media content shared in a particular geographic\narea or between areas. An example of such characteristics is the number of\nphotos shared by all users of a social network such as Instagram in a given\ncity or city area, or the content of these photos. We propose that the standard\ninequality measures used in other disciplines, such as the Gini coefficient,\ncan also be used to characterize social media inequality. To test our ideas, we\nuse a dataset of 7,442,454 public geo-coded Instagram images shared in\nManhattan during five months (March-July) in 2014, and also selected data for\n287 Census tracts in Manhattan. We compare patterns in Instagram sharing for\nlocals and for visitors for all tracts, and also for hours in a 24-hour cycle.\nWe also look at relations between social media inequality and socio-economic\ninequality using selected indicators for Census tracts.\n", "  We present here 21 cm predictions from high dynamic range simulations for a\nrange of reionization histories that have been tested against available\nLyman-alpha and CMB data. We assess the observability of the predicted spatial\n21 cm fluctuations by ongoing and upcoming experiments in the late stages of\nreionization in the limit in which the hydrogen spin temperature is\nsignificantly larger than the CMB temperature. Models consistent with the\navailable Lyman-alpha data and CMB measurement of the Thomson optical depth\npredict typical values of 10--20 mK^2 for the variance of the 21 cm brightness\ntemperature at redshifts z=7--10 at scales accessible to ongoing and upcoming\nexperiments (k < 1 h/cMpc). This is only a factor of a few below the\nsensitivity claimed to have been already reached by ongoing experiments in the\nsignal rms value. Our different models for the reionization history make\nmarkedly different predictions for the redshift evolution and thus frequency\ndependence of the 21 cm power spectrum and should be easily discernible by\nLOFAR (and later HERA and SKA1) at their design sensitivity. Our simulations\nhave sufficient resolution to assess the effect of high-density Lyman limit\nsystems that can self-shield against ionizing radiation and stay 21 cm bright\neven if the hydrogen in their surroundings is highly ionized. Our simulations\npredict that including the effect of the self-shielded gas in highly ionized\nregions reduces the large scale 21 cm power by about 30%.\n", "  We demonstrate clear weak anti-localization (WAL) effect arising from induced\nRashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in WS$_2$-covered single-layer and bilayer\ngraphene devices. Contrary to the uncovered region of a shared single-layer\ngraphene flake, WAL in WS$_2$-covered graphene occurs over a wide range of\ncarrier densities on both electron and hole sides. At high carrier densities,\nwe estimate the Rashba SOC relaxation rate to be $\\sim 0.2 \\rm{ps}^{-1}$ and\nshow that it can be tuned by transverse electric fields. In addition to the\nRashba SOC, we also predict the existence of a `valley-Zeeman' SOC from\nfirst-principles calculations. The interplay between these two SOC's can open a\nnon-topological but interesting gap in graphene; in particular, zigzag\nboundaries host four sub-gap edge states protected by time-reversal and\ncrystalline symmetries. The graphene/WS$_2$ system provides a possible platform\nfor these novel edge states.\n", "  Twisted bilayer graphene (TwBLG) is one of the simplest van der Waals\nheterostructures, yet it yields a complex electronic system with intricate\ninterplay between moir\\'{e} physics and interlayer hybridization effects. We\nreport on electronic transport measurements of high mobility small angle TwBLG\ndevices showing clear evidence for insulating states at the superlattice band\nedges, with thermal activation gaps several times larger than theoretically\npredicted. Moreover, Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations and tight binding\ncalculations reveal that the band structure consists of two intersecting Fermi\ncontours whose crossing points are effectively unhybridized. We attribute this\nto exponentially suppressed interlayer hopping amplitudes for momentum\ntransfers larger than the moir\\'{e} wavevector.\n", "  We study the putative emission of gravitational waves (GWs) in particular for\npulsars with measured braking index. We show that the appropriate combination\nof both GW emission and magnetic dipole brakes can naturally explain the\nmeasured braking index, when the surface magnetic field and the angle between\nthe magnetic dipole and rotation axes are time dependent. Then we discuss the\ndetectability of these very pulsars by aLIGO and the Einstein Telescope. We\ncall attention to the realistic possibility that aLIGO can detect the GWs\ngenerated by at least some of these pulsars, such as Vela, for example.\n", "  A new theory is proposed for explaining the experimental results with intense\nshort optical pulses. The theory is characterized by conjugate momentum\ninteraction and especially large quantum enhancement factor and will unify the\ngeneration processes of coherent phonon formerly assigned as ISRS and DECP. It\nis applied to the instantaneous generation of lattice strain and the\nquantitative relation between the incident fluence and the resultant strain is\nshown.\n", "  We report the synthesis of single crystals of a novel layered iridate\nBa$_{21}$Ir$_9$O$_{43}$, and present the crystallographic, transport and\nmagnetic properties of this material. The compound has a hexagonal structure\nwith two iridium oxide layers stacked along the $c$ direction. One layer\nconsists of a triangular arrangement of Ir$_2$O$_9$ dimers while the other\nlayer comprises two regular octahedra and one triangular pyramid, forming\ninter-penetrated triangular lattices. The resistivity as a function of\ntemperature exhibits an insulating behavior, with a peculiar $T^{-3}$ behavior.\nMagnetic susceptibility shows antiferromagnetic Curie-Weiss behavior with\n$\\Theta_\\mathrm{CW} \\simeq -$90 K while a magnetic transition occurs at\nsubstantially lower temperature of 9 K. We discuss possible valence states and\neffective magnetic moments on Ir ions in different local environments, and\nargue that the Ir ions in a unique triangular-pyramidal configuration likely\ncarry unusually large magnetic moments.\n", "  We present an open source slow control system for small and medium scale\nprojects. Thanks to its modular and flexible design, where the various\ninstruments are read and controlled by independent plugins, Doberman (Detector\nOBsERving and Monitoring ApplicatioN) can be quickly adapted for many\napplications, also making use of existing code or proprietary components. The\nsystem uses a SQL database to store the data from the instruments and provides\nan online application to display and browse through the data. It allows the\nmodification of device settings while the program is running and features a\nprotocol to handle exceptions, including the automated distribution of alarm\nmessages. We present two case studies from astroparticle physics, on which\nDoberman is successfully deployed: a low-background screening facility\ninstalled in a remote underground laboratory and a detector R&D platform using\ncryogenic liquid xenon.\n", "  Collagen fibril cross-sectional radii show no systematic variation between\nthe interior and the periphery of fibril bundles, indicating an effectively\nconstant rate of collagen incorporation into fibrils throughout the bundle.\nSuch spatially homogeneous incorporation constrains the extracellular diffusion\nof collagen precursors from sources at the bundle boundary to sinks at the\ngrowing fibrils. With a coarse-grained diffusion equation we determine\nstringent bounds, using parameters extracted from published experimental\nmeasurements of tendon development. From the lack of new fibril formation after\nbirth, we further require that the concentration of diffusing precursors stays\nbelow the critical concentration for fibril nucleation. We find that the\ncombination of the diffusive bound, which requires larger concentrations to\nensure homogeneous fibril radii, and lack of nucleation, which requires lower\nconcentrations, is only marginally consistent with fully-processed collagen\nusing conservative bounds. More realistic bounds may leave no consistent\nconcentrations. Therefore, we propose that unprocessed pC-collagen diffuses\nfrom the bundle periphery followed by local C-proteinase activity and\nsubsequent collagen incorporation at each fibril. We suggest that C-proteinase\nis localized within bundles, at fibril surfaces, during radial fibrillar\ngrowth. The much greater critical concentration of pC-collagen, as compared to\nfully-processed collagen, then provides broad consistency between homogeneous\nfibril radii and the lack of fibril nucleation during fibril growth.\n", "  We investigate theoretically the properties of squeezed states generated\nusing degenerate parametric down conversion in lossy cavities. We show that the\nLindblad master equation, which governs the evolution of this system, has as\nits solution a squeezed thermal state with an effective temperature and\nsqueezing parameter that depends on time. We derive analytical solutions for\nthe time-evolution of quadrature noise, thermal photon number, squeezing\nparameter, and total photon number under different pumping regimes. We also\nfind the steady state limits of the quadrature noises and discuss the $ g^{(2)}\n$ factor of the generated light inside the cavity in the steady state.\n", "  The recently discovered structural reconstruction in the cuprate superlattice\n(SrCuO$_2$)$_n$/(SrTiO$_3$)$_2$ has been investigated across the critical value\nof $n=5$ using resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS). We find that at the\ncritical value of $n$, the cuprate layer remains largely in the bulk-like\ntwo-dimensional structure with a minority of Cu plaquettes being reconstructed.\nThe partial reconstruction leads to quenching of the magnons starting at the\n$\\Gamma$-point due to the minority plaquettes acting as scattering points.\nAlthough comparable in relative abundance, the doped charge impurities in\nelectron-doped cuprate superconductors do not show this quenching of magnetic\nexcitations.\n", "  The prominent flat-spectrum radio quasar J0017+8135 (S5 0014+81) at z = 3.366\nis one of the most luminous active galactic nuclei (AGN) known. Its\nmilliarcsecond-scale radio jet structure has been studied with very long\nbaseline interferometry (VLBI) since the 1980s. The quasar was selected as one\nof the original defining objects of the International Celestial Reference\nFrame, but left out from its current second realization (ICRF2) because of\nsystematic long-term positional variations. Here we analyse archival 8.6- and\n2.3-GHz VLBI imaging data collected at nearly 100 different epochs during more\nthan 20 years, to obtain information about the kinematics of jet components.\nBecause of the cosmological time dilation, extensive VLBI monitoring data are\nessential to reveal changes in the jet structure of high-redshift AGN. In the\ncase of J0017+8135, the data can be described with a simple kinematic model of\njet precession with a 12-year periodicity in the observer's frame.\n", "  We investigate the cosmological consequences of a scalar-vector-tensor theory\nof gravity known as MOG. In MOG, in addition to metric tensor, there are two\nscalar fields $G(x)$ and $\\mu(x)$, and one vector field $\\phi_{\\alpha}(x)$.\nUsing the phase space analysis, we explore the cosmological consequences of a\nmodel of MOG and find some new interesting features which are absent in\n$\\Lambda$CDM model. More specifically we study the possibility that if the\nextra fields of this theory behave like dark energy to explain the cosmic\nspeedup. More interestingly, with or without cosmological constant, strongly\nphantom crossing happens. Also we find that this theory in its original form\n($\\Lambda\\neq 0$), possesses a true sequence of cosmological epochs. Albeit we\nshow that, surprisingly, there are two radiation dominated epochs $f_5$ and\n$f_6$, two matter dominated phases $f_3$ and $f_4$, and two late time\naccelerated eras $f_{12}$ and $f_{7}$. Depending on the initial conditions the\nuniverse will realize only three of these six eras. However, the matter\ndominated phases are dramatically different from the standard matter dominated\nepoch. In these phases the cosmic scale factor grows as $a(t)\\sim t^{0.46}$ and\n$t^{0.52}$, respectively, which are slower than the standard case, i.e.\n$a(t)\\sim t^{2/3}$. Considering these results we discuss the cosmological\nviability of MOG.\n", "  It is inferred from bulk-sensitive muon Knight shift measurement for a\nBi$_{1.76}$Pb$_{0.35}$Sr$_{1.89}$CuO$_{6+\\delta}$ single-layer cuprate that\nmetal-insulator (MI) transition (in the low temperature limit, $T\\rightarrow0$)\noccurs at the critical hole concentration $p=p_{\\rm MI}=0.09(1)$, where the\nelectronic density of states (DOS) at the Fermi level is reduced to zero by the\npseudogap irrespective of the N\\'eel order or spin glass magnetism.\nSuperconductivity also appears for $p>p_{\\rm MI}$, suggesting that this feature\nis controlled by the MI transition. More interestingly, the magnitude of the\nDOS reduction induced by the pseudogap remains unchanged over a wide doping\nrange ($0.1\\le p\\le0.2$), indicating that the pseudogap remains as a hallmark\nof the MI transition for $p>p_{\\rm MI}$.\n", "  When treating the exchange interaction of Wannier excitons, usually only the\nleading terms of the analytic and the nonanalytic exchange interaction are\nconsidered. However, higher order terms can lead to a splitting of exciton\nstates, for which reason a splitting of the $1S$~exciton in cuprous oxide\n$\\left(\\mathrm{Cu_{2}O}\\right)$ depending on its total momentum $\\hbar K$ has\nbeen attributed to a $K$ dependent analytic exchange interaction by Dasbach et\nal [Phys. Rev. Lett. 91, 107401 (2003)]. Going beyond the common treatment of\nthe exchange interaction, we derive the correct expressions for these $K$\ndependent higher order terms using $\\boldsymbol{k}\\cdot\\boldsymbol{p}$\nperturbation theory. We prove that the appearance of a $K$ dependent exchange\ninteraction is inseparably connected with a $K$ independent exchange\ninteraction of $P$ and $D$ excitons. We estimate the magnitude of these terms\nfor $\\mathrm{Cu_{2}O}$ from microscopic calculations and show that they are far\ntoo small to explain the observed $K$ dependent splitting. Instead, this\nsplitting has to be treated in terms of the dispersion of the excitons.\nFurthermore, we prove the occurence of a coupling between longitudinal and\ntransverse excitons in $\\mathrm{Cu_{2}O}$ due to the $K$ dependent nonanalytic\nexchange interaction.\n", "  We consider the expectation value of the quantity [3+ \\sigma (1).\\sigma\n(2)]/4 . This has a value +1 for 2 nucleons with spin S=1and zero for S=0. We\nshow that for the jj coupling 2 particle configuration [j(1) j(2)]^{J} the\nexpectation value has the structure A+B J(J+1) where A and B are constants. We\nthen show that for a 2proton-2neutron configuration with total angular momentum\nI the expectation value per pair is independent of the details of the wave\nfunction and has a similar structure A' +B' I(I+1) with B'=B/6.\n", "  We consider a two-dimensional model of three species in rock-paper-scissors\ncompetition and study the self-organisation of the population into fascinating\nspiraling patterns. Within our individual-based metapopulation formulation, the\npopulation composition changes due to cyclic dominance (dominance-removal and\ndominance-replacement), mutations, and pair-exchange of neighboring\nindividuals. Here, we study the influence of mobility on the emerging patterns\nand investigate when the pair-exchange rate is responsible for spiral waves to\nbecome elusive in stochastic lattice simulations. In particular, we show that\nthe spiral waves predicted by the system's deterministic partial equations are\nfound in lattice simulations only within a finite range of the mobility rate.\nWe also report that in the absence of mutations and dominance-replacement, the\nresulting spiraling patterns are subject to convective instability and\nfar-field breakup at low mobility rate. Possible applications of these\nresolution and far-field breakup phenomena are discussed.\n", "  We propose to measure the photo-production cross section of $J/{\\psi}$ near\nthreshold, in search of the recently observed LHCb hidden-charm resonances\n$P_c$(4380) and $P_c$(4450) consistent with 'pentaquarks'. The observation of\nthese resonances in photo-production will provide strong evidence of the true\nresonance nature of the LHCb states, distinguishing them from kinematic\nenhancements. A bremsstrahlung photon beam produced with an 11 GeV electron\nbeam at CEBAF covers the energy range of $J/{\\psi}$ production from the\nthreshold photo-production energy of 8.2 GeV, to an energy beyond the presumed\n$P_c$(4450) resonance. The experiment will be carried out in Hall C at\nJefferson Lab using a 50{\\mu}A electron beam incident on a 9% copper radiator.\nThe resulting photon beam passes through a 15 cm liquid hydrogen target,\nproducing $J/{\\psi}$ mesons through a diffractive process in the $t$-channel,\nor through a resonant process in the $s$- and $u$-channel. The decay $e^+e^-$\npair of the $J/{\\psi}$ will be detected in coincidence using the two\nhigh-momentum spectrometers of Hall C. The spectrometer settings have been\noptimized to distinguish the resonant $s$- and $u$-channel production from the\ndiffractive $t$-channel $J/{\\psi}$ production. The $s$- and $u$-channel\nproduction of the charmed 5-quark resonance dominates the $t$-distribution at\nlarge $t$. The momentum and angular resolution of the spectrometers is\nsufficient to observe a clear resonance enhancement in the total cross section\nand $t$-distribution. We request a total of 11 days of beam time with 9 days to\ncarry the main experiment and 2 days to acquire the needed $t$-channel elastic\n$J/{\\psi}$ production data for a calibration measurement. This calibration\nmeasurement in itself will greatly enhance our knowledge of $t$-channel elastic\n$J/{\\psi}$ production near threshold.\n", "  We present a method to develop a Hodge theory for tangential cohomology of\nfoliations by mimicing Witten's approach to ordinary Morse theory by\nperturbations of the Laplacian\n", "  The effects of electron correlation in the quasi-two-dimensional organic\nconductor \\alpha-(BEDT-TTF)2I3 are investigated theoretically by using an\nextended Hubbard model with on-site and nearest-neighbor Coulomb interactions.\nA variational Monte Carlo method is applied to study its ground-state\nproperties. We show that there appears a nonmagnetic horizontal-stripe charge\norder in which nearest-neighbor correlation functions indicate a tendency\ntoward a spin-singlet formation on the bonds with large transfer integrals\nalong the charge-rich stripe. Under uniaxial pressure, a first-order transition\nfrom the nonmagnetic charge order to a zero-gap state occurs. Our results on a\nspin correlation length in the charge-ordered state suggest that a spin gap is\nalmost unaffected by the uniaxial pressure in spite of the suppression of the\ncharge disproportionation. The relevance of these contrasting behaviors in spin\nand charge degrees of freedom to recent experimental observations is discussed.\n", "  Most real-world social networks are inherently dynamic, composed of\ncommunities that are constantly changing in membership. To track these evolving\ncommunities, we need dynamic community detection techniques. This article\nevaluates the performance of a set of game theoretic approaches for identifying\ncommunities in dynamic networks. Our method, D-GT (Dynamic Game Theoretic\ncommunity detection), models each network node as a rational agent who\nperiodically plays a community membership game with its neighbors. During game\nplay, nodes seek to maximize their local utility by joining or leaving the\ncommunities of network neighbors. The community structure emerges after the\ngame reaches a Nash equilibrium. Compared to the benchmark community detection\nmethods, D-GT more accurately predicts the number of communities and finds\ncommunity assignments with a higher normalized mutual information, while\nretaining a good modularity.\n", "  Over the last few decades, ecologists have come to appreciate that key\necological patterns, which describe ecological communities at relatively large\nspatial scales, are not only scale dependent, but also intimately intertwined.\nThe relative abundance of species, which informs us about the commonness and\nrarity of species, changes its shape from small to large spatial scales. The\naverage number of species as a function of area has a steep initial increase,\nfollowed by decreasing slopes at large scales. Finally, if we find a species in\na given location, it is more likely we find an individual of the same species\nclose-by, rather than farther apart. Such spatial turnover depends on the\ngeographical distribution of species, which often are spatially aggregated.\nThis reverberates on the abundances as well as the richness of species within a\nregion, but so far it has been difficult to quantify such relationships. Within\na neutral framework, which considers all individuals competitively equivalent,\nwe introduce a spatial stochastic model, which phenomenologically accounts for\nbirth, death, immigration and local dispersal of individuals. We calculate the\npair correlation function, which encapsulates spatial turnover, and the\nconditional probability to find a species with a certain population within a\ngiven circular area. Also, we calculate the macro-ecological patterns, which we\nhave referred to above, and compare the analytical formul{\\ae} with the\nnumerical integration of the model. Finally, we contrast the model predictions\nwith the empirical data for two lowland tropical forest inventories, showing\nalways a good agreement.\n", "  The effects of near neighbors on the galaxy-galaxy lensing signal are\ninvestigated using a suite of Monte Carlo simulations. The redshifts,\nluminosities, and relative coordinates for the simulated lenses were obtained\nfrom a set of galaxies with known spectroscopic redshifts and known\nluminosities. As expected, when all lenses are assigned a single, fixed\nredshift, the mean tangential shear is identically equal to the excess surface\nmass density, scaled by the critical surface mass density: $\\gamma_T =\n\\Delta\\Sigma \\times \\Sigma_c^{-1}$. When the lenses are assigned their observed\nredshifts and $\\Sigma_c$ is taken to be the critical surface mass density of\nthe central lens, the relationship $\\gamma_T = \\Delta\\Sigma \\times\n\\Sigma_c^{-1}$ is violated because $\\gtrsim 90$% of the near neighbors are\nlocated at redshifts significantly different from the central lenses. For a\ngiven central lens, physically unrelated near neighbors give rise to a ratio of\n$\\gamma_T$ to $\\Delta\\Sigma \\times \\Sigma_c^{-1}$ that spans a wide range of\n$\\sim 0.5$ to $\\sim 1.5$ at projected distances $r_p \\sim 1$ Mpc. The magnitude\nand sense of the discrepancy between $\\gamma_T$ and $\\Delta\\Sigma \\times\n\\Sigma_c^{-1}$ are functions of both $r_p$ and the velocity dispersions of the\ncentral lenses, $\\sigma_v$. At large $r_p$, the difference between $\\gamma_T$\nand $\\Delta\\Sigma \\times \\Sigma_c^{-1}$ is, on average, much greater for\nlow-$\\sigma_v$ central lenses than it is for high-$\\sigma_v$ central lenses.\n", "  Critical quantum quench of free Dirac fermions in an infinite system is\nexamined carefully. A much broader analysis, with more emphasis on free scalar\nfields, has been done in hep-th/1512.0218. For specially prepared squeezed\nstates of the massive theory, quenched states obtained are Calabrese-Cardy(CC)\nstates and generalized Calabrese-Cardy(gCC) states with higher-spin charges.\nExact time dependence of correlators are computed showing thermalization\nexplicitly. We also calculate the exact monotonic growth of entanglement\nentropy in CC states. In case of gCC states, for a particular charge, we show\nthat there is a dynamical phase transition from monotonic to non-monotonic\nentanglement entropy growth when the effective chemical potential is increased\nbeyond a critical value.\n", "  Aqueous solution of tetrabutylammonium bromide is studied by quasi-elastic\nneutron scattering, to give information on the dynamic modes involving the ions\npresent. Using a careful combination of two techniques, time-of-flight (TOF)\nand neutron spin echo (NSE), we de- couple the dynamic information in both the\ncoherently and incoherently scattered signal from this system. We take\nadvantage of the different intensity ratio of the two signals, as detected by\neach of the techniques, to achieve this decoupling. By using heavy water as the\nsol- vent, the tetrabutylammonium cation is the only hydrogen-containing\nspecies in the system and gives rise to a significant incoherent scattered\nintensity. The dynamic analysis of the incoherent signal (measured by TOF)\nleads to a translational diffusion coefficient of the cation as that is in good\nagreement with previous NMR, neutron scattering and tracer diffusion\nmeasurements. The dynamic analysis of the coherent signal observed at\nwave-vectors < 0.6 angstrom^(-1) (measured by NSE) leads to a significantly\nslower diffusive mode, by a factor of 2. This study explains that apparent\ndifference and the reasons for that.\n", "  The multiple fundamental frequency detection problem and the source\nseparation problem from a single-channel signal containing multiple oscillatory\ncomponents and a nonstationary noise are both challenging tasks. To extract the\nfetal electrocardiogram (ECG) from a single-lead maternal abdominal ECG, we\nface both challenges. In this paper, we propose a novel method to extract the\nfetal ECG signal from the single channel maternal abdominal ECG signal, without\nany additional measurement. The algorithm is composed of three main\ningredients. First, the maternal and fetal heart rates are estimated by the\nde-shape short time Fourier transform, which is a recently proposed nonlinear\ntime-frequency analysis technique; second, the beat tracking technique is\napplied to accurately obtain the maternal and fetal R peaks; third, the\nmaternal and fetal ECG waveforms are established by the nonlocal median. The\nalgorithm is evaluated on a simulated fetal ECG signal database ({\\em fecgsyn}\ndatabase), and tested on two real databases with the annotation provided by\nexperts ({\\em adfecgdb} database and {\\em CinC2013} database). In general, the\nalgorithm could be applied to solve other detection and source separation\nproblems, and reconstruct the time-varying wave-shape function of each\noscillatory component.\n", "  In this paper we derive some first order differential equations which model\nthe classical and the relativistic thin layer approximations in the presence of\na circumstellar medium with a density which is decreasing in the distance $z$\nfrom the equatorial plane. The circumstellar medium is assumed to follow a\ndensity profile with $z$ of hyperbolic type, power law type, exponential type\nor Gaussian type. The first order differential equations are solved\nanalytically, or numerically, or by a series expansion, or by Pad\\'e\napproximants. The initial conditions are chosen in order to model the temporal\nevolution of SN 1987A over 23 years. The free parameters of the theory are\nfound by maximizing the observational reliability which is based on an observed\nsection of SN 1987A.\n", "  Kes 69, 3C 396, and 3C 400.2 are mixed-morphology (MM) Galactic supernova\nremnants (SNRs), where Kes 69 and 3C 396 are interacting with molecular clouds\n(MCs). Previous X-ray studies showed that the emission from these SNRs is\nthermal. It has been suggested that MM SNRs interacting with MCs are potential\ncandidates for recombining plasma (RP) in X-rays and hadronic gamma-ray\nemission. Recently, Chandra observations revealed signs of RP in 3C 400.2. Our\npreliminary analyses show that the X-ray emission of NW and SE region of 3C\n400.2 arises from recombining plasma. We detected GeV gamma-ray emission from\nKes 69 and 3C 396 above 5$\\sigma$.\n", "  In a recent work\n[\\href{http://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.86.042113}{Phys.\nRev. A 86, 042113 (2012)}] the question of persistency of entanglement and\nnonlocality of multi-party systems under particle loss has been addressed. This\nquestion is of immense importance considering the practical realization of the\ninformation theoretic tasks which make use of the power of quantum\ncorrelations. But in multipartite scenario more interesting cases arise since\nsubsystems can also possess genuineness in correlation which is prevalently\ninequivalent to the bipartite scenario. In this work, we investigate the\npersistency of such genuine correlations under particle loss. Keeping in mind\nthe practical importance, considerable attention has been devoted to find the\nmultipartite states which exhibit maximal persistency of genuine correlations.\n", "  We apply the renormalization group theory to the dynamical systems with the\nsimplest example of basic biological motifs. This includes the interpretation\nof complex networks as the perturbation to simple network. This is the first\nstep to build our original framework to infer the properties of biological\nnetworks, and the basis work to see its effectiveness to actual complex\nsystems.\n", "  We construct the Hermite--Halphen--Bloch solution for the two-gap ($n=2$)\nLam\\'e equation of Jacobian form and give closed formulae to calculate the\nenergy band dispersion relation.\n", "  SrRuO$_3$ (SRO113) is an important material for device physics particularly\nas one of the best metallic oxide electrodes for ferroelectric devices. This\noxide has moderate electron correlations with novel properties including\nferromagnetic ordering, which can be utilized in future to spintronics and\nsuperconducting spintronics devices. Recently, we observed strongly enhanced\nmagnetization of SRO113 thin films grown on single crystals of the spin-triplet\nsuperconductor Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ (SRO214). To clarify the origin of such an\nenhancement, we conducted systematic investigations of magnetic properties of\nSRO113 films deposited on a variety of oxide substrates. We carefully\nsubtracted the substrate contributions and found that the enhanced 2\nmagnetization occurs only for SRO113/SRO214 films. We further found that\nneither strain nor metallicity of the substrate plays any significant roles in\nthe enhancement. The X-ray magnetic circular dichroism reveals that the\nsubstrate-induced strain does not switch the Ru4+ state from the low-spin to\nhigh-spin states. The film-thickness dependence of the magnetization of\nSRO113/SRO214 films strongly suggest that the additional magnetization arises\ndue to the induction of magnetic moment into the SRO214 substrate over 20-nm\ndepth. Our results imply new magnetic functionality that can trigger studies\nsearching for yet unknown physical phenomena in magnetic ruthenates.\n", "  A re-entrant gas-liquid spinodal was proposed as a possible explanation of\nthe apparent divergence of the compressibility and specific heat on\nsupercooling water. Such a counter intuitive possibility, e.g. a liquid that\nbecomes unstable to gas-like fluctuations on cooling at positive pressure, has\nnever been observed, neither in real substances nor in off-lattice simulations.\nMore recently, such re-entrant scenario has been dismissed on the premise that\nthe re-entrant spinodal would collide with the gas-liquid binodal in the\npressure-temperature plane. Here we study, numerically and analytically, two\npreviously introduced one-component patchy particle models that both show (i) a\nre-entrant spinodal and (ii) a re-entrant binodal, providing a neat in silico\n(and in charta) realization of such unconventional thermodynamic scenario.\n", "  Old and novel layered structures are attracting increasing attention for\ntheir physical, electronic, and frictional properties. SiS$_2$, isoelectronic\nto SiO$_2$, CO$_2$ and CS$_2$, is a material whose phases known experimentally\nup to 6 GPa exhibit 1D chain-like, 2D layered and 3D tetrahedral structures. We\npresent highly predictive $ab$ $initio$ calculations combined with evolutionary\nstructure search and molecular dynamics simulations of the structural and\nelectronic evolution of SiS$_2$ up to 100 GPa. A highly stable CdI$_2$-type\nlayered structure, which is octahedrally coordinated with space group\n$P\\bar{3}m1$ surprisingly appears between 4 and up to at least 100 GPa. The\ntetrahedral-octahedral switch is naturally expected upon compression, unlike\nthe layered character realized here by edge-sharing SiS$_6$ octahedral units\nconnecting within but not among sheets. The predicted phase is semiconducting\nwith an indirect band gap of about 2 eV at 10 GPa, decreasing under pressure\nuntil metallization around 40 GPa. The robustness of the layered phase suggests\npossible recovery at ambient pressure, where calculated phonon spectra indicate\ndynamical stability. Even a single monolayer is found to be dynamically stable\nin isolation, suggesting that it could possibly be sheared or exfoliated from\nbulk $P\\bar{3}m1$-SiS$_2$.\n", "  In an electrically conducting fluid, vortices stretch out a weak, large-scale\nmagnetic field to form strong current sheets on their edges. Associated with\nthese current sheets are magnetic stresses, which are subsequently released\nthrough reconnection, leading to vortex disruption, and possibly even\ndestruction. This disruption phenomenon is investigated here in the context of\ntwo-dimensional, homogeneous, incompressible magnetohydrodynamics. We derive a\nsimple order of magnitude estimate for the magnetic stresses --- and thus the\ndegree of disruption --- that depends on the strength of the background\nmagnetic field (measured by the parameter $M$, a ratio between the Alfv\\'en\nspeed and a typical flow speed) and on the magnetic diffusivity (measured by\nthe magnetic Reynolds number $\\mbox{Rm}$). The resulting estimate suggests that\nsignificant disruption occurs when $M^{2}\\mbox{Rm} = O(1)$. To test our\nprediction, we analyse direct numerical simulations of vortices generated by\nthe breakup of unstable shear flows with an initially weak background magnetic\nfield. Using the Okubo--Weiss vortex coherence criterion, we introduce a vortex\ndisruption measure, and show that it is consistent with our predicted scaling,\nfor vortices generated by instabilities of both a shear layer and a jet.\n", "  We take a tour of a set of equiangular lines in eight-dimensional Hilbert\nspace. This structure defines an informationally complete measurement, that is,\na way to represent all quantum states of three-qubit systems as probability\ndistributions. Investigating the shape of this representation of state space\nyields a pattern of connections among a remarkable spread of mathematical\nconstructions. In particular, studying the Shannon entropy of probabilistic\nrepresentations of quantum states leads to an intriguing link between the\nquestions of real and of complex equiangular lines. Furthermore, we will find\nrelations between quantum information theory and mathematical topics like\noctonionic integers and the 28 bitangents to a quartic curve.\n", "  One key factor that limits the predictive power of molecular dynamics\nsimulations is the accuracy and transferability of the input force field. Force\nfields are challenged by heterogeneous environments, where electronic responses\ngive rise to biologically important forces such as many-body polarisation and\ndispersion. The importance of polarisation was recognised early-on and\ndescribed by Cochran in 1959 [Philosophical Magazine 4 (1959) 1082-1086].\nHowever, dispersion forces are still treated at the two-body level and in the\ndipole limit, although the importance of three-body terms in the condensed\nphase was demonstrated by Barker in the 1980s [Phys. Rev. Lett. 57 (1986)\n230-233]. A way of treating both polarisation and dispersion on an equal basis\nis to coarse grain the electrons a molecular moiety to a single quantum\nharmonic oscillator, as suggested as early as the 1960s by Hirschfelder,\nCurtiss and Bird [The Molecular Theory of Gases and Liquids (1954)]. This\ntreatment, when solved in the strong coupling limit, gives all orders of\nlong-range forces. In the last decade, the tools necessary to exploit this\nstrong coupling limit have been developed, culminating in a transferable model\nof water with excellent predictive power across the phase diagram. This\ntransferability arises since the environment identifies the form of long range\ninteractions, rather than the expressions selected by the modeller. Here, we\ndiscuss the role of electronic coarse-graining in predictive multiscale\nmaterials modelling and describe the first implementation of the method in a\ngeneral purpose molecular dynamics software, QDO_MD.\n", "  Investigations of three-body nuclear systems using pionless effective field\ntheory ($\\mathrm{EFT}_{\\not{\\pi}}$) are reviewed. The history of\n$\\mathrm{EFT}_{\\not{\\pi}}$ in $nd$ and $pd$ scattering is briefly discussed and\nemphasis put on the use of strict perturbative techniques. In addition\nrenormalization issues appearing in $pd$ scattering are also presented. Bound\nstate calculations are addressed and new perturbative techniques for describing\nthem are highlighted. Three-body breakup observables in $nd$ scattering are\nalso considered and the utility of $\\mathrm{EFT}_{\\not{\\pi}}$ for addressing\nthem.\n", "  We study the rheology of dry and wet granular materials in the steady\nquasistatic regime using the Discrete Element Method (DEM) in a split-bottom\nring shear cell with focus on the macroscopic friction. The aim of our study is\nto understand the local rheology of bulk flow at various positions in the shear\nband, where the system is in critical state. The general(ized) rheology has\nfour dimensionless control parameters that relate the time scales of five\nsignificant phenomena, namely, the time scales related to confining pressure\n$t_p$, shear rate $t_{\\dot{\\gamma}}$, particle stiffness $t_k$, gravity $t_g$\nand cohesion $t_c$, respectively. We show that those phenomena collectively\ncontribute to the rheology as multiplicative correction functions.\n  While $t_{\\dot{\\gamma}}$ is large and thus little important for most of the\ndata studied, it can increase the friction of flow in critical state, where the\nshear gradients are high. $t_g$ and $t_k$ are comparable to $t_p$ in the bulk,\nbut become more or less dominant relative to $t_p$ at the extremes of the free\nsurface and deep inside the bulk, respectively.\n  We also measure the effect of strong wet cohesion on the flow rheology, as\nquantified by decreasing $t_c$. Furthermore, the proposed rheological model\npredicts well the shear thinning behavior both in the bulk and near the free\nsurface; shear thinning develops to shear thickening near the free surface with\nincreasing cohesion.\n", "  In this dissertation we use the gauge/gravity duality approach to study the\ndynamics of strongly coupled non-Abelian plasmas. Ultimately, we want to\nunderstand the properties of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP), whose scientifc\ninterest by the scientific community escalated exponentially after its\ndiscovery in the 2000's through the collision of ultrarelativistic heavy ions.\n  One can enrich the dynamics of the QGP by adding an external field, such as\nthe baryon chemical potential (needed to study the QCD phase diagram), or a\nmagnetic field. In this dissertation, we choose to investigate the magnetic\neffects. Indeed, there are compelling evidences that strong magnetic fields of\nthe order $eB\\sim 10 m_\\pi^2$ are created in the early stages of\nultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions.\n  The chosen observable to scan possible effects of the magnetic field on the\nQGP was the viscosity, due to the famous result $\\eta/s=1/4\\pi$ obtained via\nholography. In a first approach we use a caricature of the QGP, the\n$\\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills plasma to calculate the deviations of the\nviscosity as we add a magnetic field. We must emphasize, though, that a\nmagnetized plasma has a priori seven viscosity coefficients (five shears and\ntwo bulks). In addition, we also study in this same model the anisotropic heavy\nquark-antiquark potential in the presence of a magnetic field.\n  In the end, we propose a phenomenological holographic QCD-like model, which\nis built upon the lattice QCD data, to study the thermodynamics and the\nviscosity of the QGP with an external strong magnetic field.\n", "  The interstellar medium is characterized by a rich and diverse chemistry.\nMany of its complex organic molecules are proposed to form through radical\nchemistry in icy grain mantles. Radicals form readily when interstellar ices\n(composed of water and other volatiles) are exposed to UV photons and other\nsources of dissociative radiation, and, if sufficiently mobile, the radicals\ncan react to form larger, more complex molecules. The resulting complex organic\nmolecules (COMs) accompany star and planet formation, and may eventually seed\nthe origins of life on nascent planets. Experiments of increasing\nsophistication have demonstrated that known interstellar COMs as well as the\nprebiotically interesting amino acids can form through ice photochemistry. We\nreview these experiments and discuss the qualitative and quantitative kinetic\nand mechanistic constraints they have provided. We finally compare the effects\nof UV radiation with those of three other potential sources of radical\nproduction and chemistry in interstellar ices: electrons, ions and X-rays.\n", "  In this study we considered a solar sail coated with materials that undergo\nthermal desorption at a specific temperature, as a result of heating by solar\nradiation at a particular heliocentric distance. Three different scenarios,\nthat only differ in the way the sail approaches the Sun, were analyzed and\ncompared. In every case once the perihelion is reached, the sail coat undergoes\nthermal desorption. When the desorption process ends, the sail then escapes the\nSolar System having the conventional acceleration due to solar radiation\npressure. Thermal desorption here comes as an additional source of solar sail\nacceleration beside traditional propulsion systems for extrasolar space\nexploration. The compared scenarios are the following: i. Hohmann transfer plus\nthermal desorption. In this scenario the sail would be carried as a payload to\nthe perihelion with a conventional propulsion system by an Hohmann transfer\nfrom Earth's orbit to an orbit very close to the Sun (almost at 0.1 AU) and\nthen be deployed there. ii. Elliptical transfer plus Slingshot plus thermal\ndesorption. In this scenario the transfer occurs from Earth's orbit to\nJupiter's orbit. A Jupiter's fly-by leads to the orbit close to the Sun, where\nthe sail is deployed. iii. Two stage acceleration of the solar sail through\nthermal desorption. The proposed sail has two coats of the materials that\nundergo thermal desorption at different temperatures depending on the\nheliocentric distance. The first desorption occurs at the Earth orbit and\nprovides the thrust needed to propel the solar sail toward the Sun. The second\ndesorption is equivalent to that of the other scenarios.\n", "  This paper explores the application of Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN),\nSupport Vector Machine (SVM) and Kmeans clustering as tools for automated\nclassification of massive stellar spectra.\n", "  We implement a Smolin-like branching multiverse through a directed, acyclic\ngraph of $N$ metrics. Our gravitational and matter actions are\nindistinguishable from $N$ decoupled statements of General Relativity, if one\nvaries with respect to metric degrees of freedom. We replace $N-1$ metrics with\nscalar fields by conformally relating each metric to its unique graph\npredecessor. Varying with respect to the $N-1$ scalar fields gives a\nmultiscalar-tensor model which naturally features dark matter candidates.\nBuilding atop an argument of Chapline and Laughlin, branching is accomplished\nwith the emergence of order parameters during gravitational collapse: we\nbootstrap a suitably defined $N$ scalar field model with initial data from an\n$N-1$ field model. We focus on the nearest-neighbour approximation, determine\nconditions for dynamical stability, and compute the equations of motion. The\nmodel features a novel screening property where the scalar fields actively\nadjust to decouple themselves from the stress, oscillating about the requisite\nvalues. In the Newtonian limit, these background values for the scalar fields\nexactly reproduce Newton's law of gravitation.\n", "  An asymptotically exact two-dimensional theory of functionally graded\npiezoelectric shells is derived by the variational-asymptotic method. The error\nestimation of the constructed theory is given in the energetic norm. As an\napplication, analytical solution to the problem of forced vibration of a\nfunctionally graded piezoceramic cylindrical shell with thickness polarization\nfully covered by electrodes and excited by a harmonic voltage is found.\n", "  A quantum algorithm to solve the parity problem is better than its most\nefficient classical counter- part with a separation that is polynomial in the\nnumber of queries. This was shown by E. Bernstein and U. Vazirani and was one\nof the earliest indications that the quantum information processing can\noutperform the classical one by a significant margin. The problem and its\nsolution both is usually stated for a 2-level system since we generally work\nwith bits/qubits. However, many works have been done generalizing known quantum\ncomputing techniques to higher level systems. Following this, we look at a\ngeneralization of the Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm implemented on a general\nqudit system.\n", "  In medical research, economics, and the social sciences data frequently\nappear as subsets of a set of objects. Over the past century a number of\ndescriptive statistics have been developed to construct network structure from\nsuch data. However, these measures lack a generating mechanism that links the\ninferred network structure to the observed groups. To address this issue, we\npropose a model-based approach called the Hub Model which assumes that every\nobserved group has a leader and that the leader has brought together the other\nmembers of the group. The performance of Hub Models is demonstrated by\nsimulation studies. We apply this model to infer the relationships among\nSenators serving in the 110th United States Congress, the characters in a\nfamous 18th century Chinese novel, and the distribution of flora in North\nAmerica.\n", "  The solution to science's replication crisis is a new ecosystem in which\nscientists sell what they learn from their research. In each pairwise\ntransaction, the information seller makes (loses) money if he turns out to be\ncorrect (incorrect). Responsibility for the determination of correctness is\ndelegated, with appropriate incentives, to the information purchaser. Each\ntransaction is brokered by a central exchange, which holds money from the\nanonymous information buyer and anonymous information seller in escrow, and\nwhich enforces a set of incentives facilitating the transfer of useful, bluntly\nhonest information from the seller to the buyer. This new ecosystem, capitalist\nscience, directly addresses socialist science's replication crisis by\nexplicitly rewarding accuracy and penalizing inaccuracy.\n", "  The generalized Hunter-Saxton system comprises several well-known models from\nfluid dynamics and serves as a tool for the study of fluid convection and\nstretching in one-dimensional evolution equations. In this work, we examine the\nglobal regularity of periodic smooth solutions of this system in $L^p$, $p \\in\n[1,\\infty)$, spaces for nonzero real parameters $(\\lambda,\\kappa)$. Our results\nsignificantly improve/extend those by Wunsch et al. [27-29] and Sarria [21].\nFurthermore, we study the effects that different boundary conditions have on\nthe global regularity of solutions by replacing periodicity with a homogeneous\nthree-point boundary condition and establish finite-time blowup of a\nlocal-in-time solution of the resulting system for particular values of the\nparameters.\n", "  We investigate a zero-range process where the underlying one-particle\nstationary distribution has multifractality. The multiparticle stationary\nprobability measure can be written in a factorized form. If the number of the\nparticles is sufficiently large, a great part of the particles condense at the\nsite with the highest measure of the one-particle problem. The number of the\nparticles out of the condensate scales algebraically with the system size and\nthe exponent depends on the strength of the disorder. These results can be well\nreproduced by a branching process, with similar multifractal property.\n", "  Quarks and gluons are the fundamental building blocks of matter responsible\nfor most of the visible energy density in the universe. However, they cannot be\ndirectly observed due to the confining nature of the strong force. The LHC uses\npp collisions to probe the highest energy reactions involving quarks and gluons\nhappening at the smallest distance scales ever studied in a terrestrial\nlaboratory. The quantum properties of the initiating partons are encoded in the\ndistribution of energy inside and around jets. These quantum properties of jets\n(QPJ) can be used to study the high energy nature of the strong force and\nprovide a way to tag the hadronic decays of heavy boosted particles. The ATLAS\ndetector is well-suited to perform measurements of the structure of high energy\njets. A variety of novel techniques utilizing the unique capabilities of the\nATLAS calorimeter and tracking detectors are introduced in order to probe the\nexperimental and theoretical limits of the QPJ.\n  Quarks and gluons may also be the key to understanding fundamental problems\nwith the SM. In particular, the top quark has a unique relationship with the\nnewly discovered Higgs boson and as such could be a portal to discovering new\nparticles. In many extensions of the SM, the top quark has a partner with\nsimilar properties. For example, a SUSY stop could solve The Hierarchy Problem.\nMiraculously, a SUSY neutralino could also account for the DM observed in the\nuniverse and may be copiously produced in stop decays. High-energy top quarks\nfrom stops result in jets with a rich structure that can be identified using\nthe techniques developed in the study of the QPJ. While there is no significant\nevidence for stop production at the LHC, the stringent limits established by\nthis search have important implications for SUSY and other models.\n  (adapted from the original to save characters)\n", "  The majority-vote model with noise is one of the simplest nonequilibrium\nstatistical model that has been extensively studied in the context of complex\nnetworks. However, the relationship between the critical noise where the\norder-disorder phase transition takes place and the topology of the underlying\nnetworks is still lacking. In the paper, we use the heterogeneous mean-field\ntheory to derive the rate equation for governing the model's dynamics that can\nanalytically determine the critical noise $f_c$ in the limit of infinite\nnetwork size $N\\rightarrow \\infty$. The result shows that $f_c$ depends on the\nratio of ${\\left\\langle k \\right\\rangle }$ to ${\\left\\langle k^{3/2}\n\\right\\rangle }$, where ${\\left\\langle k \\right\\rangle }$ and ${\\left\\langle\nk^{3/2} \\right\\rangle }$ are the average degree and the $3/2$ order moment of\ndegree distribution, respectively. Furthermore, we consider the finite size\neffect where the stochastic fluctuation should be involved. To the end, we\nderive the Langevin equation and obtain the potential of the corresponding\nFokker-Planck equation. This allows us to calculate the effective critical\nnoise $f_c(N)$ at which the susceptibility is maximal in finite size networks.\nWe find that the $f_c-f_c(N)$ decays with $N$ in a power-law way and vanishes\nfor $N\\rightarrow \\infty$. All the theoretical results are confirmed by\nperforming the extensive Monte Carlo simulations in random $k$-regular\nnetworks, Erd\\\"os-R\\'enyi random networks and scale-free networks.\n", "  Random number generators are essential to ensure performance in information\ntechnologies, including cryptography, stochastic simulations and massive data\nprocessing. The quality of random numbers ultimately determines the security\nand privacy that can be achieved, while the speed at which they can be\ngenerated poses limits to the utilisation of the available resources. In this\nwork we propose and demonstrate a quantum entropy source for random number\ngeneration on an indium phosphide photonic integrated circuit made possible by\na new design using two-laser interference and heterodyne detection. The\nresulting device offers high-speed operation with unprecedented security\nguarantees and reduced form factor. It is also compatible with complementary\nmetal-oxide semiconductor technology, opening the path to its integration in\ncomputation and communication electronic cards, which is particularly relevant\nfor the intensive migration of information processing and storage tasks from\nlocal premises to cloud data centres.\n", "  In this paper we study the relativistic Boltzmann equation in a spatially\nflat FLRW spacetime. We consider Israel particles, which are the relativistic\ncounterpart of the Maxwellian particles, and obtain global-in-time existence\nand the asymptotic behaviour of solutions. The main argument of the paper is to\nuse the energy method of Guo, and we observe that the method can be applied to\nstudy small solutions in a cosmological case. It is the first result of this\ntype where a physically well-motivated scattering kernel is considered for the\ngeneral relativistic Boltzmann equation.\n", "  Within our Galaxy, supernova remnants are believed to be the major sources of\ncosmic rays up to the \"knee\". However important questions remain regarding the\nshare of the hadronic and leptonic components, and the fraction of the\nsupernova energy channelled into these components. We address such question by\nthe means of numerical simulations that combine a hydrodynamic treatment of the\nshock wave with a kinetic treatment of particle acceleration. Performing 3D\nsimulations allows us to produce synthetic projected maps and spectra of the\nthermal and non-thermal emission, that can be compared with multi-wavelength\nobservations (in radio, X-rays, and gamma-rays). Supernovae come in different\ntypes, and although their energy budget is of the same order, their remnants\nhave different properties, and so may contribute in different ways to the pool\nof Galactic cosmic-rays. Our first simulations were focused on thermonuclear\nsupernovae, like Tycho's SNR, that usually occur in a mostly undisturbed\nmedium. Here we present our 3D simulations of core-collapse supernovae, like\nthe Cas A SNR, that occur in a more complex medium bearing the imprint of the\nwind of the progenitor star.\n", "  We report a search for $B^{0}\\to \\eta \\eta $ with a data sample corresponding\nto an integrated luminosity of $698 \\,{\\rm fb}^{-1}$ containing $753 \\times\n10^{6}$ $B\\bar{B}$ pairs collected at the $\\Upsilon(4S)$ resonance with the\nBelle detector at the KEKB asymmetric-energy $e^{+}e^{-}$ collider. The\nbranching fraction is measured to be $\\mathcal{B}(B^{0} \\to \\eta \\eta ) =\n(7.6^{+2.7 +1.4}_{-2.3 -1.6}) \\times 10^{-7}$ at the level of 3.3 standard\ndeviations above zero, which provides the first evidence for the decay $B^{0}\n\\to \\eta \\eta$.\n", "  The paper presents short technical description of Yakutsk Radio Array and\nsome preliminary results obtained from measurements of radio emission at 32 MHz\nfrequency induced by air shower particles with energy\n{\\epsilon}$\\geq$1$\\cdot$10$^{19}$ eV. The data obtained at Yakutsk array in\n1987-1989 (first set of measurements) and 2009-2014 (new set of measurements).\nFor the first time, at Yakutsk array radio emission from air shower with energy\n> 10$^{19}$ eV was registered including the shower with highest energy ever\nregistered at Yakutsk array with energy $\\sim$2$\\cdot$10$^{20}$ eV.\n", "  Neutron correlation spectroscopy can exceed direct spectroscopy in the\nincoming beam intensity by up to two orders of magnitude at the same energy\nresolution. However, the propagation of the counting noise in the correlation\nalgorithm of data reduction is disadvantageous for the lowest intensity parts\nof the observed spectrum. To mitigate this effect at pulsed neutron sources we\npropose two dimensional time-of-flight recording of each neutron detection\nevent: with respect to both the neutron source pulses and to the rotation phase\nof the pseudo-random beam modulation statistical chopper. We have identified a\nformulation of the data reduction algorithm by matching the data processing\ntime channel width to the inherent time resolution of this chopper, which makes\nthe reconstruction of the direct time-of-flight spectra exact and independent\nof all other contributions to instrumental resolution. Two ways are proposed\nfor most flexible choice of intensity vs. resolution without changing the\nstatistical chopper or its speed: changing the size of the beam window during\nthe experiment or varying intensity and resolution options in the data\nreduction algorithm after the experiment. This latter is a unique and very\npromising new potential offered by the correlation method. Furthermore, it\ndisplays reduced sensitivity to external background, also due to the much\nhigher signal intensity. This is particularly advantageous for extending the\noperational range to higher neutron energies. In hot and thermal neutron\nvibrational spectroscopy, the statistical chopper approach allows us to achieve\nvery significant gains in spectrometer efficiency compared to using\nconventional choppers. High intensity for the most intense features in the\nspectra and the reduced sensitivity to sample independent background make\ncorrelation spectroscopy a most powerful choice for studying small samples.\n", "  For the coefficients of the amplitude a set of simultaneous equations is\nderived in momentum space. By the auxiliary conditions they are equivalent to\nnonrelativistic equations and suitable for the investigation of two-nucleon\nsystem.\n", "  The transient signals derived from femtosecond pump-probe experiments are\nanalyzed in terms of the coherent evolution of the energy levels perturbed by\nthe excitation pulse. The model system is treated as the sum of independent\ntwo-level subsystems that evolve adiabatically or are permanently excited,\ndepending on the detuning from the central wavelength of the excitation laser.\nThis approach will allow us to explain numerically and analytically the\nconvergence between the coherent and incoherent (rate equations) treatments for\ncomplex multi-level systems. It will be also shown that the parameter that\ndetermines the validity of the incoherent treatment is the distribution of\nstates outside and inside the laser bandwidth, rather than the density of\nstates as it is commonly accepted.\n", "  We developed the general approach that gives possibility to calculate the\ncoupling coefficients for arbitrary chain of resonators without using the great\nnumber of eigen functions. For understanding this method and having possibility\nto control the accuracy of obtained results, we applied this procedure for\nsimplest structure that has the analytical solutions - a circular cylindrical\nwaveguide with uniform cross section.\n", "  Graphene, as an atomic-thick ultrasoft membrane, almost has no resistance\nagainst out-of-plane deformations and, therefore, it is always wrinkled to a\ncertain degree. Recently, corrugated structures and their effects on the\nelectronic properties of monolayer graphene have been studied extensively.\nHowever, similar experimental studies in bilayer graphene have yet to be\nreported. Here, we show that corrugations in bilayer graphene can generate\nincommensurate stacking solitons (domain walls) between commensurate\nBernal-stacked domains. By using scanning tunneling microscopy, we\nmicroscopically study electronic structures of a corrugation-induced stacking\nsoliton that separates two adjacent AB and BA stacked bilayer regions with a\nuniform interlayer potential difference. Both topological gapless edge states\nand quasi-localized gapped quantum-well-like states are observed in the\nnanoscale corrugation. Atomic resolution mapping of the topological edge states\nalong the stacking soliton reveals the existence of intervalley scattering\nbetween them, which could explain recent experiments where the conductance\nalong domain walls of gapped graphene bilayer is smaller than a quantized value\n4e2 h.\n", "  We present an update of the ABM12 PDF analysis including improved constraints\ndue to the final version of the inclusive DIS HERA data, the Tevatron and LHC\ndata on the W- and Z-production and those on heavy-quark production in the\nelectron- and neutrino-induced DIS at HERA and the fixed-target experiments\nNOMAD and CHORUS. We also check the impact of the Tevatron and LHC top-quark\nproduction data on the PDFs and the strong coupling constant. We obtain\n$\\alpha_s(M_Z)=0.1145(9)$ and $0.1147(8)$ with and without the top-quark data\nincluded, respectively.\n", "  Understanding the overall features of magnetic excitation is essential for\nclarifying the mechanism of Cooper pair formation in iron-based\nsuperconductors. In particular, clarifying the relationship between magnetism\nand superconductivity is a central challenge because magnetism may play a key\nrole in their exotic superconductivity. BaFe2As2 is one of ideal systems for\nsuch investigation because its superconductivity can be induced in several\nways, allowing a comparative examination. Here we report a study on the spin\nfluctuations of the hole-overdoped iron-based superconductors Ba1-xKxFe2As2 (x\n= 0.5 and 1.0; Tc = 36 K and 3.4 K, respectively) over the entire Brillouin\nzone using inelastic neutron scattering. We find that their spin spectra\nconsist of spin wave and chimney-like dispersions. The chimney-like dispersion\ncan be attributed to the itinerant character of magnetism. The band width of\nthe spin wave-like dispersion is almost constant from the non-doped to\noptimum-doped region, which is followed by a large reduction in the overdoped\nregion. This suggests that the superconductivity is suppressed by the reduction\nof magnetic exchange couplings, indicating a strong relationship between\nmagnetism and superconductivity in iron-based superconductors.\n", "  We show theoretically that it is possible to form a cold molecular ion from a\npair of colliding atom and ion at low energy by photoassociative two-photon\nRaman processes. We explore the possibility of stimulated Raman adiabatic\npassage (STIRAP) from the continuum of ion-atom scattering states to an ionic\nmolecular state. We provide physical conditions under which coherent population\ntransfer is possible in stimulated Raman photoassociation. Our results are\nimportant for experimental realization of PA in ion-atom cold collisions.\n", "  We theoretically explore manipulation of interactions between excited and\nground state atoms at nanoscale separations by cavity quantum electrodynamics\n(CQED). We develop an adiabatic molecular dressed state formalism and show that\nit is possible to generate Fano-Feshbach resonances between ground and\nlong-lived excited-state atoms inside a cavity. The resonances are shown to\narise due to non-adiabatic coupling near a pseudo-crossing between the dressed\nstate potentials. We illustrate our results with a model study using fermionic\n$^{171}$Yb atoms in a two-modal cavity. Our study is important for manipulation\nof interatomic interactions at low energy by cavity field.\n", "  Fibers constitute the backbone of modern communication and are used in laser\nsurgeries; fibers also genarate coherent X-ray, guided-sound and\nsupercontinuum. In contrast, fibers for capillary oscillations, which are\nunique to liquids, were rarely considered in optofluidics. Here we fabricate\nfibers by water bridging an optical tapered-coupler to a microlensed coupler.\nOur water fibers are held in air and their length can be longer than a\nmillimeter. These hybrid fibers co-confine two important oscillations in\nnature: capillary- and electromagnetic-. We optically record vibrations in the\nwater fiber, including an audio-rate fundamental and its 3 overtones in a\nharmonic series, that one can hear in soundtracks attached. Transforming\nMicro-Electro-Mechanical-Systems [MEMS] to Micro-Electro-Capillary-Systems\n[MECS], boosts the device softness by a million to accordingly improve its\nresponse to minute forces. Furthermore, MECS are compatible with water, which\nis a most important liquid in our world.\n", "  We investigate the non-equilibrium charge dynamics of a triple quantum dot\nand demonstrate how electron transport through these systems can give rise to\nnon-trivial tunnelling paths. Using a real-time charge sensing method we\nestablish tunnelling pathways taken by particular electrons under well-defined\nelectrostatic configurations. We show how these measurements map to the\nchemical potentials for different charge states across the system. We use a\nmodified Hubbard Hamiltonian to describe the system dynamics and show that it\nreproduces all experimental observations.\n", "  Improved orbits are presented for the visual binaries WDS 02366+1227, WDS\n02434-6643, WDS 03244-1539, WDS 08507+1800, WDS 09128-6055, WDS 11532-1540, WDS\n17375+2419, and WDS 22408-0333. The latest orbits for these binaries were\ndemonstrating a great inconsistency between the systemic mass obtained through\nKepler's Third Law and that calculated as a sum of their components' mass\nthrough standard mass-luminosity and mass-spectrum relationships. Our\nimprovement allowed us to obtain consistent systemic masses for WDS 02434-6643\nand WDS 09128-6055 without a need for changing the Hipparcos parallax. For the\nremaining 6 pairs, we suggest the use of their dynamical parallax as a reliable\ndistance estimate unless more precise parallax is reported. Astrophysical and\ndynamical properties of individual objects are discussed.\n", "  The existence of mirror partners of Standard-Model fermions offers a viable\nalternative to a fundamental BEH mechanism, with the coupling corresponding to\nthe gauged mirror generation symmetry becoming naturally strong at energies\naround 1 TeV. The resulting non-perturbative processes produce dynamical\nkatoptron masses which might range from 0.1 to 1.15 TeV in a way circumventing\nusual problems with the S parameter. Moreover, they create mirror mesons\nbelonging in two main groups, with masses differing from each other\napproximately by a factor of six and which might range approximately from 0.1\nto 2.8 TeV. Since the corresponding phenomenology expected at hadron colliders\nis particularly rich, some interesting mirror-meson cross-sections are\npresented, something that might also lead to a deeper understanding of the\nunderlying mirror fermion structure. Among other findings, results in principle\ncompatible with indications from LHC concerning decays of new particles to two\nphotons are analyzed.\n", "  The motion of a viscous drop is investigated when the interface is fully\ncovered with a stagnant layer of surfactant in an arbitrary unsteady Stokes\nflow for the low surface P\\'eclet number limit. The effect of the interfacial\nslip coefficient on the behavior of the flow field is also considered. The\nhydrodynamic problem is solved by the solenoidal decomposition method and the\ndrag force is computed in terms of Faxen's laws using a perturbation ansatz in\npowers of the surface P\\'eclet number. The analytical expressions for the\nmigration velocity of the drop are also obtained in powers of the surface\nP\\'eclet number. Further instances corresponding to a given ambient flow as\nuniform flow, Couette flow, Poiseuille flow are analyzed. Moreover, it is\nobserved that, a surfactant-induced cross-stream migration of the drop occur\ntowards the centre-line in both Couette flow and Poiseuille flow cases. The\nvariation of the drag force and migration velocity is computed for different\nparameters such as P\\'eclet number, Marangoni number etc.\n", "  The expansion of a magnetized high-pressure plasma into a low-pressure\nambient medium is examined with particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations. The\nmagnetic field points perpendicularly to the plasma's expansion direction and\nbinary collisions between particles are absent. The expanding plasma steepens\ninto a quasi-electrostatic shock that is sustained by the lower-hybrid (LH)\nwave. The ambipolar electric field points in the expansion direction and it\ninduces together with the background magnetic field a fast E cross B drift of\nelectrons. The drifting electrons modify the background magnetic field,\nresulting in its pile-up by the LH shock. The magnetic pressure gradient force\naccelerates the ambient ions ahead of the LH shock, reducing the relative\nvelocity between the ambient plasma and the LH shock to about the phase speed\nof the shocked LH wave, transforming the LH shock into a nonlinear LH wave. The\noscillations of the electrostatic potential have a larger amplitude and\nwavelength in the magnetized plasma than in an unmagnetized one with otherwise\nidentical conditions. The energy loss to the drifting electrons leads to a\nnoticable slowdown of the LH shock compared to that in an unmagnetized plasma.\n", "  We present a description and validation of a finite volume solver aimed at\nsolving the problems of microscale urban flows where vegetation is present. The\nsolver is based on the five equation system of Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes\nequations for atmospheric boundary layer flows, which are complemented by the\nk-epsilon turbulence model. The vegetation is modelled as a porous zone, and\nthe effects of the vegetation are included in the momentum and turbulence\nequations. A detailed dry deposition model is incorporated in the pollutant\ntransport equation, allowing the investigation of the filtering properties of\nurban vegetation. The solver is validated on four test cases to assess the\ncomponents of the model: the flow and pollutant dispersion around the 2D hill,\nthe temporal evolution of the rising thermal bubble, the flow through and\naround the forest canopy, and a hedgerow filtering the particle-laden flow.\nGenerally good agreement with the measured values or previously computed\nnumerical solution is observed, although some deficiencies of the model are\nidentified. These are related to the chosen turbulence model and to the\nuncertainties of the vegetation properties.\n", "  The Cygnus Loop is a well-studied supernova remnant (SNR) that has been\nobserved across the electromagnetic spectrum. Although widely believed to be an\nSNR shell with a blow- out region in the south, we consider the possibility\nthat this object is two SNRs projected along the same line-of-sight by using\nmulti-wavelength images and modelling. Our results show that a model of two\nobjects including some overlap region/interaction between the two objects has\nthe best match to the observed data.\n", "  Laser spectroscopy of the Lamb shift (2S-2P energy difference) in light\nmuonic atoms or ions, in which one negative muon $\\mu^-$ is bound to a nucleus,\nhas been performed. The measurements yield significantly improved values of the\nroot-mean-square charge radii of the nuclei, owing to the large muon mass,\nwhich results in a vastly increased muon wave function overlap with the\nnucleus. The values of the proton and deuteron radii are 10 and 3 times more\naccurate than the respective CODATA values, but 7 standard deviations smaller.\nData on muonic helium-3 and -4 ions is being analyzed and will give new\ninsights. In future, the (magnetic) Zemach radii of the proton and the helium-3\nnuclei will be determined from laser spectroscopy of the 1S hyperfine\nsplittings, and the Lamb shifts of muonic Li, Be and B can be used to improve\nthe respective charge radii.\n", "  At a distance of 1.295 parsecs, the red-dwarf Proxima Centauri ($\\alpha$\nCentauri C, GL 551, HIP 70890, or simply Proxima) is the Sun's closest stellar\nneighbor and one of the best studied low-mass stars. It has an effective\ntemperature of only $\\sim$ 3050 K, a luminosity of $\\sim$0.1 per cent solar, a\nmeasured radius of 0.14 R$_\\odot$ and a mass of about 12 per cent the mass of\nthe Sun. Although Proxima is considered a moderately active star, its rotation\nperiod is $\\sim$ 83 days, and its quiescent activity levels and X-ray\nluminosity are comparable to the Sun's. New observations reveal the presence of\na small planet orbiting Proxima with a minimum mass of 1.3~Earth masses and an\norbital period of $\\sim$11.2 days. Its orbital semi-major axis is $\\sim0.05$\nAU, with an equilibrium temperature in the range where water could be liquid on\nits surface.\n", "  Perovskites with fast oxygen ion conduction can enable technologies like\nsolid oxide fuel cells. One component of fast oxygen ion conduction is low\noxygen migration barrier. Here we apply ab initio methods on over 40\nperovskites to produce a database of oxygen migration barriers ranging from 0.2\nto 1.6 eV. Mining the database revealed that systems with low barriers also\nhave low metal-oxygen bond strength, as measured by oxygen vacancy formation\nenergy and oxygen p-band center energy. These correlations provide a powerful\ndescriptor for the development of new oxygen ion conductors and may explain the\npoor stability of some of the best oxygen conducting perovskites under reducing\nconditions. Other commonly-cited measures of space, volume, or structure\nideality showed only weak correlation with migration barrier. The lowest\nmigration barriers (< 0.5 eV) belong to perovskites with non-transition-metal\nB-site cations, and may require vacancy-creation strategies that involve no\ndopants or low-association dopants for optimal performance.\n", "  Single crystals of Frank-Kasper compounds RTM$_2$Al$_{20}$ (R = Eu, Gd and\nLa; TM = V and Ti) were grown by self-flux method and their physical properties\nwere investigated through magnetization ($M$), magnetic susceptibility\n($\\chi$), specific heat ($C_P$) and electrical resistivity ($\\rho$)\nmeasurements. Powder x-ray diffraction studies and structural analysis showed\nthat these compounds crystallize in the cubic crystal structure with the space\ngroup $Fd\\overline{3}m$. The magnetic susceptibility for the compounds\nEuTi$_2$Al$_{20}$ and GdTi$_2$Al$_{20}$ showed a sudden jump below the N{\\'e}el\ntemperature $T_N$ indicative of plausible double magnetic transition. Specific\nheat ($C_P$) and electrical resistivity ($\\rho$) measurements also confirm the\nfirst-order magnetic transition (FOMT) and possible double magnetic\ntransitions. Temperature variation of heat capacity showed a sharp phase\ntransition and huge $C_P$ value for the (Eu/Gd)Ti$_2$Al$_{20}$ compounds Full\nwidth at half-maximum (FWHM) $<$ 0.2 K) which is reminiscent of a first-order\nphase transition and a unique attribute among RTM$_2$Al$_{20}$ compounds. We\nobserved clear anomaly between heating and cooling cycle in temperature-time\nrelaxation curve for the compounds GdTi$_2$Al$_{20}$ (2.38 $K$) and\nEuTi$_2$Al$_{20}$ (3.2 $K$) which is indicating a thermal arrest due to the\nlatent heat. The temperature variation of $S_{mag}$ for GdTi$_2$Al$_{20}$\nsaturates to a value $0.95R\\ln8$ while the other magnetic systems exhibited\nstill lower entropy saturation values in the high temperature limit.\nResistivity measurements showed that all the samples behave as normal Fermi\nliquid type compounds and $\\rho(T)$ due to electron-phonon scattering follows\nBloch-Gr$\\ddot{\\textrm u}$neisen-Mott relation in the paramagnetic region.\n", "  A molecular level understanding of the properties of electroactive vanadium\nspecies in aqueous solution is crucial for enhancing the performance of\nvanadium redox flow batteries (RFB). Here, we employ Car-Parrinello molecular\ndynamics (CPMD) simulations based on density functional theory to investigate\nthe hydration structures, first hydrolysis reaction and diffusion of aqueous\nV$^{2+}$, V$^{3+}$, VO$^{2+}$, and VO$_2^+$ ions at 300 K. The results indicate\nthat the first hydration shell of both V$^{2+}$ and V$^{3+}$ contains six water\nmolecules, while VO$^{2+}$ is coordinated to five and VO$_2^+$ to three water\nligands. The first acidity constants (p$K_\\mathrm{a}$) estimated using\nmetadynamics simulations are 2.47, 3.06 and 5.38 for aqueous V$^{3+}$, VO$_2^+$\nand VO$^{2+}$, respectively, while V$^{2+}$ is predicted to be a fairly weak\nacid in aqueous solution with a p$K_\\mathrm{a}$ value of 6.22. We also show\nthat the presence of chloride ions in the first coordination sphere of the\naqueous VO$_2^+$ ion has a significant impact on water hydrolysis leading to a\nmuch higher p$K_\\mathrm{a}$ value of 4.8. This should result in a lower\npropensity of aqueous VO$_2^+$ for oxide precipitation reaction in agreement\nwith experimental observations for chloride-based electrolyte solutions. The\ncomputed diffusion coefficients of vanadium species in water at room\ntemperature are found to increase as V$^{3+}$ $<$ VO$_2^+$ $<$ VO$^{2+}$ $<$\nV$^{2+}$ and thus correlate with the simulated hydrolysis constants, namely,\nthe higher the p$K_\\mathrm{a}$ value, the greater the diffusion coefficient.\n", "  We report the results of XMM-Newton observations of the Galactic\nmixed-morphology supernova remnant G350.0$-$2.0. Diffuse thermal X-ray emission\nfills the north-western part of the remnant surrounded by radio shell-like\nstructures. We did not detect any X-ray counterpart of the latter structures,\nbut found several bright blobs within the diffuse emission. The X-ray spectrum\nof the most part of the remnant can be described by a collisionally-ionized\nplasma model VAPEC with solar abundances and a temperature of $\\approx 0.8$\nkeV. The solar abundances of plasma indicate that the X-ray emission comes from\nthe shocked interstellar material. The overabundance of Fe was found in some of\nthe bright blobs. We also analysed the brightest point-like X-ray source 1RXS\nJ172653.4$-$382157 projected on the extended emission. Its spectrum is well\ndescribed by the two-temperature optically thin thermal plasma model MEKAL\ntypical for cataclysmic variable stars. The cataclysmic variable source nature\nis supported by the presence of a faint ($g\\approx21$) optical source with\nnon-stellar spectral energy distribution at the X-ray position of 1RXS\nJ172653.4$-$382157. It was detected with the XMM-Newton optical/UV monitor in\nthe $U$ filter and was also found in the archival H$\\alpha$ and\noptical/near-infrared broadband sky survey images. On the other hand, the X-ray\nspectrum is also described by the power law plus thermal component model\ntypical for a rotation powered pulsar. Therefore, the pulsar interpretation of\nthe source cannot be excluded. For this source, we derived the upper limit for\nthe pulsed fraction of 27 per cent.\n", "  Recent gamma-ray observations show that middle aged supernova remnants (SNRs)\ninteracting with molecular clouds (MCs) can be sources of both GeV and TeV\nemission. Based on the MC association, two scenarios have been proposed to\nexplain the observed gamma-ray emission. In one, energetic cosmic ray (CR)\nparticles escape from the SNR and then illuminate nearby MCs, producing\ngamma-ray emission, while the other involves direct interaction between the SNR\nand MC. In the direct interaction scenario, re-acceleration of pre-existing CRs\nin the ambient medium is investigated while particles injected from the thermal\npool are neglected in view of the slow shock speeds in middle aged SNRs.\nHowever, standard diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) theory produces a steady\nstate particle spectrum that is too flat compared to observations, which\nsuggests that the high energy part of the observed spectrum has not yet reached\na steady state. We derive a time dependent DSA solution in the test particle\nlimit for re-acceleration of pre-existing CRs case and show that it is capable\nof reproducing the observed gamma-ray emission in SNRs like IC 443 and W44, in\nthe context of a MC interaction model. We also provide a simple physical\npicture to understand the time dependent DSA spectrum. A spatially averaged\ndiffusion coefficient around the SNR can be estimated through fitting the\ngamma-ray spectrum. The spatially averaged diffusion coefficient in middle aged\nSNRs like IC 443 and W44 is estimated to be ~ 10^25 cm^2/s at ~ 1GeV, which is\nbetween the Bohm limit and interstellar value.\n", "  Coulomb interaction has a striking effect on electronic propagation in one\ndimensional conductors. The interaction of an elementary excitation with\nneighboring conductors favors the emergence of collective modes which\neventually leads to the destruction of the Landau quasiparticle. In this\nprocess, an injected electron tends to fractionalize into separated pulses\ncarrying a fraction of the electron charge. Here we use two-particle\ninterferences in the electronic analog of the Hong-Ou-Mandel experiment in a\nquantum Hall conductor at filling factor 2 to probe the fate of a single\nelectron emitted in the outer edge channel and interacting with the inner one.\nBy studying both channels, we analyze the propagation of the single electron\nand the generation of interaction induced collective excitations in the inner\nchannel. These complementary information reveal the fractionalization process\nin time domain and establish its relevance for the destruction of the\nquasiparticle which degrades into the collective modes.\n", "  Information diffusion in networks has received a lot of recent attention.\nMost previous work addresses the influence maximization problem of selecting an\nappropriate set of seed nodes to initiate the diffusion process so that the\nlargest number of nodes is reached. Since the seed selection problem is NP\nhard, most solutions are sub-optimal. Furthermore, there may be settings in\nwhich the seed nodes are predetermined. Thus, a natural question that arise is:\ngiven a set of seed nodes, can we select a small set of nodes such that if we\nimprove their reaction to the diffusion process, the largest increase in\ndiffusion spread is achieved? We call this problem, the boost set selection\nproblem. In this paper, we formalize this problem, study its complexity and\npropose appropriate algorithms. We also evaluate the effect of boosting in a\nnumber of real networks and report the increase of influence spread achieved\nfor different seed sets, time limits in the diffusion process and other\ndiffusion parameters.\n", "  This paper summarises progress made towards the radiation hardening of LED\nemergency luminaires for evacuation and emergency response within the\nunderground areas of the CERN accelerator complex. The objective has been to\nradiation harden existing Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) emergency luminaires\nto maximise lighting performance, without compromising IEC 60598-2-22\ncompliance. A systems level approach has been adopted, leading to the\ndevelopment of a diode bridge based AC/DC power converter. Modified COTS\nluminaires including this converter design have been irradiated (to 100 kGy TID\nusing a Cobalt-60 source), with results of a subsequent photometric analysis\npresented. Following encouraging tests results, a reference design for the\npower converter has been released under the CERN Open Hardware License to\nencourage manufacturer adoption. The paper concludes with areas of interest for\nfuture research in further improving the radiation hardness of LED emergency\nlighting for accelerators with detailed studies at the component level for high\npower white LED devices and associated optical components.\n", "  The induced magnetic moments in the V 3d electronic states of interface\natomic layers in a Fe(6ML)/V(7ML) superlattice was investigated by x-ray\nresonant magnetic scattering. The first V atomic layer next to Fe was found to\nbe strongly antiferromagnetically polarized relatively to Fe and the magnetic\nmoments of the next few atomic layers in the interior V region decay\nexponentially with increasing distance from the interface, while the magnetic\nmoments of the Fe atomic layers largely remain bulk-like. The induced V moments\ndecay more rapidly as observed by x-ray magnetic scattering than in standard\nx-ray magnetic circular dichroism. The theoretical description of the induced\nmagnetic atomic layer profile in V was found to strongly rely on the interface\nroughness within the superlattice period. These results provide new insight\ninto interface magnetism by taking advantage of the enhanced depth sensitivity\nto the magnetic profile over a certain resonant energy bandwidth in the\nvicinity of the Bragg angles.\n", "  The work presented in my doctoral thesis is an experimental investigation of\nthe nature of order to disorder transition of vortex lattice in a Type-II\nsuperconductor namely Co-intercalated 2H-NbSe2 using scanning tunnelling\nspectroscopy and complimentary ac susceptibility measurements. We have shown by\nperforming real space imaging across the magnetic field driven peak effect that\nthe vortex lattice in a 3-dimensional, weakly pinned Type-II superconductor\ndisorders through two distinct topological phase transitions. Clear evidence of\nsuperheating and supercooling with different topological property of the\nmetastable states from the actual ground states indicated the nature of both\nthe phase transformations to be of first order. We have also demonstrated the\nrole of underlying crystalline lattice symmetry by showing that it aligns the\nvortex lattice along preferential directions which is the lattice vectors of\nthe crystal lattice itself. This underlying coupling also has profound\nimplication in the order disorder transition indicating the significant role of\nvortex lattice-crystal lattice interaction in vortex phase diagram which was\nearlier being neglected.\n", "  The Future Circular Collider study, hosted by CERN to design post-LHC\nparticle accelerator options in a worldwide context, is focused on\nproton-proton high-energy and electron-positron high-luminosity frontier\nmachines. This new accelerator complex represents a great challenge under\nseveral aspects, which involve R&D on beam dynamics and new technologies. One\nvery critical point in this context is represented by collective effects,\ngenerated by the interaction of the beam with self-induced electromagnetic\nfields, called wake fields, which could produce beam instabilities, thus\nreducing the machines performance and limiting the maximum stored current. It\nis therefore very important to be able to predict these effects and to study in\ndetail potential solutions to counteract them. In this paper the resistive wall\nand some other important geometrical sources of impedance for the FCC\nelectron-positron accelera- tor are identified and evaluated, and their impact\non the beam dynamics, which in some cases could lead to unwanted instabilities,\nis discussed.\n", "  We present two efficient and intruder-free methods for treating dynamic\ncorrelation on top of general multi-configuration reference wave\nfunctions---including such as obtained by the density matrix renormalization\ngroup (DMRG) with large active spaces. The new methods are the second order\nvariant of the recently proposed multi-reference linearized coupled cluster\nmethod (MRLCC) [S. Sharma, A. Alavi, J. Chem. Phys. 143, 102815 (2015)], and of\nN-electron valence perturbation theory (NEVPT2), with expected accuracies\nsimilar to MRCI+Q and (at least) CASPT2, respectively. Great efficiency gains\nare realized by representing the first-order wave function with a combination\nof internal contraction (IC) and matrix product state perturbation theory\n(MPSPT). With this combination, only third order reduced density matrices\n(RDMs) are required. Thus, we obviate the need for calculating (or estimating)\nRDMs of fourth or higher order; these had so far posed a severe bottleneck for\ndynamic correlation treatments involving the large active spaces accessible to\nDMRG. Using several benchmark systems, including first and second row\ncontaining small molecules, Cr$_2$, pentacene and oxo-Mn(Salen), we shown that\nactive spaces containing at least 30 orbitals can be treated using this method.\nOn a single node, MRLCC2 and NEVPT2 calculations can be performed with over 550\nand 1100 virtual orbitals, respectively. We also critically examine the errors\nincurred due to the three sources of errors introduced in the present\nimplementation - calculating second order instead of third order energy\ncorrections, use of internal contraction and approximations made in the\nreference wavefunction due to DMRG.\n", "  We investigated the effects of student-generated problems on exams. The\nprocess was gradual with some training throughout the semester. Initial results\nwere highly positive with the students involved performing significantly\nbetter, and showing statistically significant improvement (t = 5.04) compared\nto the rest of the class, on average. Overall, performance improved when\nstudents generated problems. Motivation was a limiting factor. There is\nsignificant potential for improving student learning of physics and other\nproblem-based topics.\n", "  ASTROSAT is India's first satellite fully devoted to astronomical\nobservations covering a wide spectral band from optical to hard X-rays by a\ncomplement of 4 co-aligned instruments and a Scanning Sky X-ray Monitor. One of\nthe instruments is Large Area X-ray Proportional Counter with 3 identical\ndetectors. In order to assess the performance of this instrument, a balloon\nexperiment with two prototype Large Area X-ray Proportional Counters (LAXPC)\nwas carried out on 2008 April 14. The design of these LAXPCs was similar to\nthose on the ASTROSAT except that their field of view (FOV) was 3$^{\\circ}$\n$\\times$ 3$^{\\circ}$ versus FOV of 1$^{\\circ}$ $\\times$ 1$^{\\circ}$ for the\nLAXPCs on the ASTROSAT. The LAXPCs are aimed at the timing and spectral studies\nof X-ray sources in 3-80 keV region. In the balloon experiment, the LAXPC,\nassociated electronics and support systems were mounted on an oriented platform\nwhich could be pre-programmed to track any source in the sky. A brief\ndescription of the LAXPC design, laboratory tests, calibration and the detector\ncharacteristics is presented here. The details of the experiment and background\ncounting rates of the 2 LAXPCs at the float altitude of about 41 km are\npresented in different energy bands. The bright black hole X-ray binary Cygnus\nX-1 (Cyg X-1) was observed in the experiment for $\\sim$ 3 hours. Details of Cyg\nX-1 observations, count rates measured from it in different energy intervals\nand the intensity variations of Cyg X-1 detected during the observations are\npresented and briefly discussed.\n", "  Borrowing ideas from the relation between simply laced Lie algebras and\nDynkin diagrams, a weighted graph theory representation of quantum information\nis addressed. In this way, the density matrix of a quantum state can be\ninterpreted as a signless Laplacian matrix of an associated graph. Using\nsimilarities with root systems of simply laced Lie algebras, one-qubit theory\nis analyzed in some details and is found to be linked to a non-oriented\nweighted graph having two vertices. Moreover, this one-qubit theory is\ngeneralized to n-qubits. In this representation, quantum gates correspond to\ngraph weight operations preserving the probability condition. A speculation\nfrom string theory, via D-brane quivers, is also given.\n", "  In this work we present a model for the evacuation of pedestrians from an\nenclosure considering a continuous space substrate and discrete time. We\nanalyze the influence of behavioral features that affect the use of the empty\nspace, that can be linked to the attitudes or characters of the pedestrians. We\nstudy how the interaction of different behavioral profiles affects the needed\ntime to evacuate completely a room and the occurrence of clogging. We find that\nneither fully egotistic nor fully cooperative attitudes are optimal from the\npoint of view of the crowd. In contrast, intermediate behaviors provide lower\nevacuation times. This lead us to identify some phenomena closely analogous to\nthe {\\em faster-is-slower} effect. The proposed model enables for the\nintroduction of Game Theory elements to solve conflicts between pedestrians\nwhich try to occupy the same space. Moreover, it allows for distinguishing\nbetween the role of the attitudes in the search for empty space and the\nattitudes in the conflicts. In the present version we only focus on the first\nof these instances.\n", "  In a recent paper, \"Why does deep and cheap learning work so well?\", Lin and\nTegmark claim to show that the mapping between deep belief networks and the\nvariational renormalization group derived in [arXiv:1410.3831] is invalid, and\npresent a \"counterexample\" that claims to show that this mapping does not hold.\nIn this comment, we show that these claims are incorrect and stem from a\nmisunderstanding of the variational RG procedure proposed by Kadanoff. We also\nexplain why the \"counterexample\" of Lin and Tegmark is compatible with the\nmapping proposed in [arXiv:1410.3831].\n", "  Using high dispersion high quality spectra of HD 30963 obtained with the\nechelle spectrograph SOPHIE at Observatoire de Haute Provence in November 2015,\nwe show that this star, hitherto classified as a B9 III superficially normal\nstar, is actually a new Chemically Peculiar star of the HgMn type. Spectrum\nsynthesis reveals large overabundances of Mn, Sr, Y, Zr , Pt and Hg and\npronounced underabundances of He and Ni which are characteristic of HgMn stars.\nWe therefore propose that this interesting object be reclassified as a B9 HgMn\nstar.\n", "  We discuss the use of the language of operads to try to understand holography\nand through that quantum gravity. As we find out, the Deligne Conjecture and\nthe action of the Grothendieck-Teichmuller group play an important role.\n"]}
