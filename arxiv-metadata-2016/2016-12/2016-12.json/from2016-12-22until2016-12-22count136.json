Special attention is\nconcentrated upon the gauge characterization of the basic geometric objects\nborne by the formalisms. It is pointed out that spin-affine configurations are\nmost naively defined by carrying out parallel displacements of null world\nvectors within the framework of the {\\gamma}-formalism. The standard result\nthat assigns a covariant gauge behaviour to the symmetric parts of any\nadmissible spin connexions is deduced out of building up a generalized version\nof spin transformation laws. A fairly complete algebraic description of\ncurvature splittings is carried out on the basis of the construction of a set\nof spinor commutators for each formalism. The pertinent computations take up\nthe utilization of some covariant differential prescriptions which facilitate\nspecifying the action of the commutators on arbitrary spin tensors and\ndensities. It turns out that the implementation of such commutators under\ncertain circumstances gives rise to a system of wave equations for gravitons\nand Infeld-van der Waerden photons which possess in either formalism a\ngauge-invariance property associated with appropriate spinor-index\nconfigurations. The situation regarding the accomplishment of the couplings\nbetween Dirac fields and electromagnetic curvatures is entertained to a\nconsiderable extent.\n", "  We present a detailed study of the spin-torque diode effect in\nCoFeB/MgO/CoFe/NiFe magnetic tunnel junctions. From the evolution of the\nresonance frequency with magnetic field at different angles, we clearly\nidentify the free-layer mode and find an excellent agreement with simulations\nby taking into account several terms for magnetic anisotropy. Moreover, we\ndemonstrate the large contribution of the out-of-plane torque in our junctions\nwith asymmetric electrodes compared to the in-plane torque. Consequently, we\nprovide a way to enhance the sensitivity of these devices for the detection of\nmicrowave frequency.\n", "  We report on the measurement of the all-particle cosmic ray energy spectrum\nwith the IceTop air shower array in the energy range from 1.58 PeV to 1.26 EeV.\nThe IceTop air shower array is the surface component of the IceCube Neutrino\nObservatory at the geographical South Pole. The analysis was performed using\nonly information from IceTop. The data used in this work were taken from June\n1, 2010 to May 13, 2011. During that period the IceTop array consisted of 73\nstations compared to 81 in its final configuration. The measured spectrum\nexhibits a clear deviation from a single power law above the knee around 4PeV\nand below 1EeV. We observe spectral hardening around 18 PeV and steepening\naround 130 PeV.\n", "  Waves with different symmetries exist in two-component Bose-Einstein\ncondensates (BECs) whose dynamics is described by a system of coupled\nGross-Pitaevskii (GP) equations. A first type of waves corresponds to\nexcitations for which the motion of both components is locally in phase. In the\nsecond type of waves the two components have a counter-phase local motion. In\nthe case of different values of inter- and intra-component interaction\nconstants, the long wave-length behavior of these two modes corresponds to two\ntypes of sound with different velocities. In the limit of weak nonlinearity and\nsmall dispersion the first mode is described by the well-known Korteweg-de\nVries (KdV) equation. We show that in the same limit the second mode can be\ndescribed by the Gardner (modified KdV) equation, if the intra-component\ninteraction constants have close enough values. This leads to a rich\nphenomenology of nonlinear excitations (solitons, kinks, algebraic solitons,\nbreathers) which does not exist in the KdV description.\n", "  Femtosecond electron bunches with keV energies and eV energy spread are\nneeded by condensed matter physicists to resolve state transitions in carbon\nnanotubes, molecular structures, organic salts, and charge density wave\nmaterials. These semirelativistic electron sources are not only of interest for\nultrafast electron diffraction, but also for electron energy-loss spectroscopy\nand as a seed for x-ray FELs. Thus far, the output energy spread (hence pulse\nduration) of ultrafast electron guns has been limited by the achievable\nelectric field at the surface of the emitter, which is 10 MV/m for DC guns and\n200 MV/m for RF guns. A single-cycle THz electron gun provides a unique\nopportunity to not only achieve GV/m surface electric fields but also with\nrelatively low THz pulse energies, since a single-cycle transform-limited\nwaveform is the most efficient way to achieve intense electric fields. Here,\nelectron bunches of 50 fC from a flat copper photocathode are accelerated from\nrest to tens of eV by a microjoule THz pulse with peak electric field of 72\nMV/m at 1 kHz repetition rate. We show that scaling to the readily-available\nGV/m THz field regime would translate to monoenergetic electron beams of ~100\nkeV.\n", "  In this work, the radiative corrections to the production of a light Higgs\nboson ($h^0$) with a pair of lightest neutralinos (${\\tilde{\\chi}}_1^0$) in\n$e^+ e^-$ collisions within MSSM are presented, including the on-shell\nrenormalization scheme in the loop calculations. We have studied the QED\ncorrections as well as the weak corrections, where the contribution from both\ncorrections is significant and needs to be taken into account in the future\nlinear colliders experiments. The result includes the numerical calculations\nfor two different SUSY scenarios---Higgsino and Gaugino scenarios--- for $e^+\ne^-\\rightarrow{\\tilde{\\chi}}_1^0 {\\tilde{\\chi}}_1^0 h^0$.\n", "  We study numerically the solutions to the effective equations of Bianchi IX\nspacetimes within Loop Quantum Cosmology. We consider Bianchi IX models with\nand without inverse triad corrections whose matter content is a scalar field\nwithout mass. The solutions are classified using the classical observables. We\nshow that both effective theories --with lapse N=V and N=1-- solve the big bang\nsingularity and reproduce the classical dynamics far from the bounce. Moreover,\ndue to the spatial compactness, there is an infinity number of bounces and\nrecollapses. We study the limit of large volume and show that both effective\ntheories reproduce the same dynamics, thus recovering general relativity. We\nimplement a procedure to identify amongst the Bianchi IX solutions, those that\nbehave like k=0,1 FLRW as well as Bianchi I, II, and VII_0 models. The\neffective solutions exhibit Bianchi I phases with Bianchi II transitions and\nalso Bianchi VII_0 phases, which had not been studied before, at the quantum\nnor effective level. We comment on the possible implications of these results\nfor a quantum modification to the classical BKL behaviour.\n", "  The fast marching method is a widely used numerical method for solving the\nEikonal equation arising from a variety of scientific and engineering fields.\nIt is long deemed inherently sequential and an efficient parallel algorithm\napplicable to large-scale practical applications is not available in the\nliterature. In this study, we present a highly scalable massively parallel\nimplementation of the fast marching method using a domain decomposition\napproach. Central to this algorithm is a novel restarted narrow band approach\nthat coordinates the frequency of communications and the amount of computations\nextra to a sequential run for achieving an unprecedented parallel performance.\nWithin each restart, the narrow band fast marching method is executed; simple\nsynchronous local exchanges and global reductions are adopted for communicating\nupdated data in the overlapping regions between neighboring subdomains and\ngetting the latest front status, respectively. The independence of front\ncharacteristics is exploited through special data structures and augmented\nstatus tags to extract the masked parallelism within the fast marching method.\nThe efficiency, flexibility, and applicability of the parallel algorithm are\ndemonstrated through several examples. These problems are extensively tested on\nsix grids with up to 1 billion points using different numbers of processes\nranging from 1 to 65536. Remarkable parallel speedups are achieved using tens\nof thousands of processes. Detailed pseudo-codes for both the sequential and\nparallel algorithms are provided to illustrate the simplicity of the parallel\nimplementation and its similarity to the sequential narrow band fast marching\nalgorithm.\n", "  Ultrafast magnetization dynamics in metallic heterostructures consists of a\ncombination of local demagnetization in the ferromagnetic constituent and\nspin-dependent transport contributions within and in between the constituents.\nSeparation of these local and non-local contributions is essential to obtain\nmicroscopic understanding and for potential applications of the underlying\nmicroscopic processes. By comparing the ultrafast changes of the polarization\nrotation and ellipticity in the magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE) we observe a\ntime-dependent magnetization profile M(z,t) in Co/Cu(001) films by exploiting\nthe effective depth sensitivity of the method. By analyzing the spatio-temporal\ncorrelation of these profiles we find that on time scales before hot electron\nthermalization (<100 fs) the transient magnetization of Co films is governed by\nspin-dependent transport effects, while after hot electron thermalization (>200\nfs) local spin-flip processes dominate.\n", "  In this paper, we present a theoretical and numerical analysis of the free\nexpansion of a Bose-Einstein condensate, where we assume that the single\nparticle energy spectrum is deformed due to a possible quantum structure of\nspacetime. Also, we consider the presence of interparticle interactions in\norder to study more realistic and specific scenarios. The modified free\nvelocity expansion of the condensate leads in a natural way to a modification\nof the uncertainty principle, which allows us to investigate some possible\nfeatures of the Planck scale regime in low-energy earth-based experiments.\n", "  We model the one-dimension (1D) to three-dimension (3D) crossover in a\ncylindrically trapped Fermi gas with attractive interactions and\nspin-imbalance. We calculate the mean-field phase diagram, and study the\nrelative stability of exotic superfluid phases as a function of interaction\nstrength and temperature. For weak interactions and low density, we find\n1D-like behavior, which repeats as a function of the chemical potential as new\nchannels open. For strong interactions, mixing of single-particle levels gives\n3D-like behavior at all densities. Furthermore, we map the system to an\neffective 1D model, finding significant density dependence of the effective 1D\nscattering length.\n", "  Variability and lack of control in the nature of contacts between metal/MoS2\ninterface is a major bottleneck in the realisation of high-performance devices\nbased on layered materials for several applications. In this letter, we report\non the reduction in Schottky barrier height at metal/MoS2 interface by\nengineering the surface states through sulphur treatment. Electrical\ncharacteristics for back-gated MoS2 field effect transistor structures were\ninvestigated for two high work-function metal contacts Ni and Pd. Contacts on\nMoS2 treated with sulphur exhibited significant improvements in Ohmic nature\nwith concomitant reduction in variability compared to those on untreated MoS2\nfilms leading to a 2x increase in extracted mobility. X-ray Photoelectron\nSpectroscopy (XPS) measurements, Raman Spectroscopy and comparison of threshold\nvoltages indicated absence of additional doping or structural changes due to\nsulphur treatment. The Schottky barrier heights were extracted from\ntemperature-dependent transfer characteristics based on the thermionic current\nmodel. A reduction in barrier height of 80 and 135 meV extracted for Ni/MoS2\nand Pd/MoS2 contacts respectively is hence attributed to the increase in\nsurface states (or stronger Fermi level pinning) due to sulphur treatment. The\ncorresponding charge neutrality levels at metal/MoS2 interface, were extracted\nto be 0.16 eV (0.17 eV) below the conduction band before (after) Sulphur\ntreatment. This first report of surface states engineering in MoS2 leading to\nsuperior contacts is expected to significantly benefit the entire class of\ndevices based on layered 2D materials.\n", "  We consider the Stokes eigenvalue problem in a bounded domain of R3 with\nDirich- let boundary conditions. The aim of this paper is to advance the\ndevelopment of high-order terms in the asymptotic expansions of the boundary\nperturbations of eigen- values, eigenfunctions and eigenpressures for the\nStokes operator caused by small per- turbations of the boundary. Our derivation\nis rigorous and proved by layer potential techniques.\n", "  We present the results of searches for point-like sources of neutrinos based\non the first combined analysis of data from both the ANTARES and IceCube\nneutrino telescopes. The combination of both detectors which differ in size and\nlocation forms a window in the Southern sky where the sensitivity to point\nsources improves by up to a factor of two compared to individual analyses.\nUsing data recorded by ANTARES from 2007 to 2012, and by IceCube from 2008 to\n2011, we search for sources of neutrino emission both across the Southern sky\nand from a pre-selected list of candidate objects. No significant excess over\nbackground has been found in these searches, and flux upper limits for the\ncandidate sources are presented for $E^{-2.5}$ and $E^{-2}$ power-law spectra\nwith different energy cut-offs.\n", "  The discovery by Kim and Chan (KC) of an anomalous decrease in the period of\ntorsional oscillators (TO) containing samples of solid $^4$He at temperatures\nbelow 0.2 K was initially interpreted as a superfluid-like decoupling of a\nfraction of the solid moment of inertia from the TO. These experiments appeared\nto confirm the thirty-year-old theoretical prediction by Chester, Andreev, and\nLeggett of the existence of a low-temperature Bose-condensed supersolid phase\nin solid $^4$He. The initial results of KC lead to a flurry of experimental and\ntheoretical activity and their results for bulk $^4$He samples were soon\nconfirmed in a number of laboratories. The early excitement in this field,\nhowever, has been tempered by the realization that an anomaly in the shear\nmodulus of solid helium $^4$He may explain most if not all of the period shifts\nobserved in the early TO experiments. In principle, it is possible to\ndistinguish experimentally between shear modulus induced period shifts and\nperiod shifts resulting from other physical mechanisms through the use of\nmultiple frequency torsional oscillators. In this paper we shall discuss our\nrecent results on bulk solid $^4$He with double and triple mode TOs, using both\nopen cylindrical cells and annular cells. In these experiments, we have\nobserved a small frequency independent contribution to the period shift signal\nsuch as might be expected in the presence of a supersolid phase. Since the\ninterplay between the elastic properties of the solid and the mechanics of TOs\ncan be subtle and depends on the specific design of the TO, we shall discuss in\ndetail the mechanics of the TOs employed in our measurements applying both\nanalytic and finite element methods (FEM) for the analysis.\n", "  In \\v{C}erenkov and Smith-Purcell free-electron lasers (FELs), a resonant\ninteraction between the electron beam and the co-propagating surface mode can\nproduce copious amount of coherent terahertz (THz) radiation. We perform a\nthree-dimensional (3D) analysis of the surface mode, taking the effect of\nattenuation into account, and set up 3D Maxwell-Lorentz equations for both\nthese systems. Based on this analysis, we determine the requirements on the\nelectron beam parameters, i.e., beam emittance, beam size and beam current for\nthe successful operation of a \\v{C}erenkov FEL.\n", "  We explore the use of Wilson flow to study the deconfinement transition in\nSU(3) gauge theory. We use the flowed Polyakov loop as a renormalized order\nparameter for the transition, and use it to renormalize the Polyakov loop. We\nalso study the flow properties of the electric and magnetic gluon condensates,\nand demonstrate that the difference of the flowed operators shows rapid change\nacross the transition point.\n", "  The spectral shape of reactor antineutrinos measured in recent experiments\nshows anomalies in comparison to neutrino reference spectra. New precision\nmeasurements of the reactor neutrino spectra as well as more complete input in\nnuclear data bases are needed to resolve the observed discrepancies between\nmodels and experimental results. This article proposes the combination of\nexperiments at reactors which are highly enriched in ${}^{235}$U with\ncommercial reactors with typically lower enrichment to gain new insights into\nthe origin of the anomalous neutrino spectrum. The presented method clarifies,\nif the spectral anomaly is either solely or not at all related to the predicted\n${}^{235}$U spectrum. Considering the current improvements of the energy scale\nuncertainty of present-day experiments, a significance of three sigma and above\ncan be reached. As an example, we discuss the option of a direct comparison of\nthe measured shape in the currently running Double Chooz near detector and the\nupcoming Stereo experiment. A quantitative feasibility study emphasizes that a\nprecise understanding of the energy scale systematics is a crucial prerequisite\nin recent and next generation experiments investigating the spectral anomaly.\n", "  We investigate the implications of the Higgs rate measurements from Run 1 of\nthe LHC for the mass of the light scalar top partner (stop) in the Minimal\nSupersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM). We focus on light stop masses, and we\ndecouple the second, heavy stop and the gluino to the multi-TeV range in order\nto obtain a Higgs mass of around 125 GeV. We derive lower mass limits for the\nlight stop within various scenarios, taking into account the effects of a\npossibly light scalar tau partner (stau) or chargino on the Higgs rates, of\nadditional Higgs decays to undetectable new physics, as well as of\nnon-decoupling of the heavy Higgs sector. Under conservative assumptions, the\nstop can be as light as 123 GeV. Relaxing certain theoretical and experimental\nconstraints, such as vacuum stability and model-dependent bounds on sparticle\nmasses from LEP, we find that the light stop mass can be as light as 116 GeV.\nOur indirect limits are complementary to direct limits on the light stop mass\nfrom collider searches and have important implications for electroweak\nbaryogenesis in the MSSM as a possible explanation for the observed\nmatter-antimatter asymmetry of the Universe.\n", "  We present a re-analysis of the CFHTLenS weak gravitational lensing survey\nusing Complete Orthogonal Sets of E/B-mode Integrals, known as COSEBIs. COSEBIs\nprovide a complete set of functions to efficiently separate E-modes from\nB-modes and hence allow for robust and stringent tests for systematic errors in\nthe data. This analysis reveals significant B-modes on large angular scales\nthat were not previously seen using the standard E/B decomposition analyses. We\nfind that the significance of the B-modes is enhanced when the data is split by\ngalaxy type and analysed in tomographic redshift bins. Adding tomographic bins\nto the analysis increases the number of COSEBIs modes, which results in a less\naccurate estimation of the covariance matrix from a set of simulations. We\ntherefore also present the first compressed COSEBIs analysis of survey data,\nwhere the COSEBIs modes are optimally combined based on their sensitivity to\ncosmological parameters. In this tomographic CCOSEBIs analysis we find the\nB-modes to be consistent with zero when the full range of angular scales are\nconsidered.\n", "  Transport of neural signals in the brain is challenging, owing to neural\ninterference and neural noise. There is experimental evidence of multiplexing\nof sensory information across population of neurons, particularly in the\nvertebrate visual and olfactory systems. Recently, it has been discovered that\nin lateral intraparietal cortex of the brain, decision signals are multiplexed\nwith decision-irrelevant visual signals. Furthermore, it is well known that\nseveral cortical neurons exhibit chaotic spiking patterns. Multiplexing of\nchaotic neural signals and their successful demultiplexing in the neurons\namidst interference and noise, is difficult to explain. In this work, a novel\ncompressed sensing model for efficient multiplexing of chaotic neural signals\nconstructed using the Hindmarsh-Rose spiking model is proposed. The signals are\nmultiplexed from a pre-synaptic neuron to its neighbouring post-synaptic\nneuron, in the presence of $10^4$ interfering noisy neural signals and\ndemultiplexed using compressed sensing techniques.\n", "  The proper motions of 15 nearby (d < 1 kpc) open clusters were recalculated\nusing data from the UCAC4 catalog. Only evolved or main sequence stars inside a\ncertain radius from the center of the cluster were used. The results differ\nsignificantly from the ones presented by Dias et al. (2014). This could be\nexplained by the different approach to taking the field star contamination into\naccount. The present work aims to emphasize the importance of applying\nphotometric criteria for the calculation of open cluster proper motions.\n", "  Pulsed ESR experiments are reported for ensembles of negatively-charged\nnitrogen-vacancy centers (NV$^-$) in diamonds at X-band magnetic fields\n(280-400 mT) and low temperatures (2-70 K). The NV$^-$ centers in synthetic\ntype IIb diamonds (nitrogen impurity concentration $<1$~ppm) are prepared with\nbulk concentrations of $2\\cdot 10^{13}$ cm$^{-3}$ to $4\\cdot 10^{14}$ cm$^{-3}$\nby high-energy electron irradiation and subsequent annealing. We find that a\nproper post-radiation anneal (1000$^\\circ$C for 60 mins) is critically\nimportant to repair the radiation damage and to recover long electron spin\ncoherence times for NV$^-$s. After the annealing, spin coherence times of T$_2\n= 0.74$~ms at 5~K are achieved, being only limited by $^{13}$C nuclear spectral\ndiffusion in natural abundance diamonds. At X-band magnetic fields, strong\nelectron spin echo envelope modulation (ESEEM) is observed originating from the\ncentral $^{14}$N nucleus. The ESEEM spectral analysis allows for accurate\ndetermination of the $^{14}$N nuclear hypefine and quadrupole tensors. In\naddition, the ESEEM effects from two proximal $^{13}$C sites (second-nearest\nneighbor and fourth-nearest neighbor) are resolved and the respective $^{13}$C\nhyperfine coupling constants are extracted.\n", "  We present a Lax pair for the sixth Painlev\\'e equation arising as a\ncontinuous isomonodromic deformation of a system of linear difference equations\nwith an additional symmetry structure. We call this a symmetric\ndifference-differential Lax pair. We show how the discrete isomonodromic\ndeformations of the associated linear problem gives us a discrete version of\nthe fifth Painlev\\'e equation. By considering degenerations we obtain symmetric\ndifference-differential Lax pairs for the fifth Painlev\\'e equation and the\nvarious degenerate versions of the third Painlev\\'e equation.\n", "  Common asset holding by financial institutions, namely portfolio overlap, is\nnowadays regarded as an important channel for financial contagion with the\npotential to trigger fire sales and thus severe losses at the systemic level.\nIn this paper we propose a method to assess the statistical significance of the\noverlap between pairs of heterogeneously diversified portfolios, which then\nallows us to build a validated network of financial institutions where links\nindicate potential contagion channels due to realized portfolio overlaps. The\nmethod is implemented on a historical database of institutional holdings\nranging from 1999 to the end of 2013, but can be in general applied to any\nbipartite network where the presence of similar sets of neighbors is of\ninterest. We find that the proportion of validated network links (i.e., of\nstatistically significant overlaps) increased steadily before the 2007-2008\nglobal financial crisis and reached a maximum when the crisis occurred. We\nargue that the nature of this measure implies that systemic risk from fire\nsales liquidation was maximal at that time. After a sharp drop in 2008,\nsystemic risk resumed its growth in 2009, with a notable acceleration in 2013,\nreaching levels not seen since 2007. We finally show that market trends tend to\nbe amplified in the portfolios identified by the algorithm, such that it is\npossible to have an informative signal about financial institutions that are\nabout to suffer (enjoy) the most significant losses (gains).\n", "  Quantum measurements on a two-level system can have more than two independent\noutcomes, and in this case, the measurement cannot be projective. Measurements\nof this general type are essential to an operational approach to quantum\ntheory, but so far, the nonprojective character of a measurement can only be\nverified experimentally by already assuming a specific quantum model of parts\nof the experimental setup. Here, we overcome this restriction by using a\ndevice-independent approach. In an experiment on pairs of\npolarization-entangled photonic qubits we violate by more than 8 standard\ndeviations a Bell-like correlation inequality that is valid for all sets of\ntwo-outcome measurements in any dimension. We combine this with a\ndevice-independent verification that the system is best described by two\nqubits, which therefore constitutes the first device-independent certification\nof a nonprojective quantum measurement.\n", "  QPOs are a common feature in the X-ray power density spectrum of black hole\nbinaries and a potentially powerful tool to probe the spacetime geometry around\nthese objects. Here we discuss their constraining power to test the Kerr black\nhole hypothesis within the relativistic precession model. We compare our\nresults with the constraints that can be obtained from gravitational waves and\niron line. We find that QPOs may provide very precise measurements, but they\nare strongly affected by parameter degeneracy, and it is difficult to test the\nKerr metric with this approach in the absence of independent observations to\nconstrain the mass or the spin.\n", "  We study static, spherically symmetric equilibrium configurations in extended\ntheories of gravity (ETG) following the notation introduced by Capozziello et\n{\\it al}. We calculate the differential equations for the stellar structure in\nsuch theories in a very generic form i.e., the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff\ngeneralization for any ETG is introduced. Stability analysis is also\ninvestigated with special focus on the particular example of scalar-tensor\ngravity.\n", "  We show that certain isomorphisms of (twisted) KR-groups that underlie\nT-dualities of torus orientifold string theories have purely algebraic\nanalogues in terms of algebraic K-theory of real varieties and equivalences of\nderived categories of (twisted) coherent sheaves. The most interesting\nconclusion is a kind of Mukai duality in which the \"dual abelian variety\" to a\nsmooth projective genus-1 curve over R with no real points is (mildly)\nnoncommutative.\n", "  We study the fermionic dark matter (DM) particle interacting with Standard\nModel quarks via a light pseudoscalar mediator. We consider separately the\nscenarios for which the DM-pseudoscalar coupling is $CP$ conserving or $CP$\nviolating. We show that taking a contact interaction is not suitable, even when\nthe mediator has a mass of the same order of magnitude as the typical momentum\ntransfer at the direct-detection experiments, such that the allowed DAMA region\nis excluded or considerably modified by the correct relic density requirement.\nThe DAMA result seems to indicate that the $CP$-violating interaction is\ndominant at direct searches. We find that, if the proton-to-neutron effective\ncoupling ratio is $-60\\sim -40$, the exclusion limits set by SuperCDMS,\nXENON100, and LUX are highly suppressed, and the DAMA signal can thus be easily\nreconciled with these null measurements. For this model, the allowed region\ndetermined by the DAMA signal and correct relic density can successfully\nsatisfy the conditions required by the thermal equilibrium, big bang\nnucleosynthesis, and DM self-interactions. The results of future measurements\non flavor physics will provide important constraints on the related models.\nPrecise measurements performed by COUPP, PICASSO, SIMPLE and KIMS should be\nable to test this model in the near future.\n", "  Charged colloidal particles trapped at an air--water interface are well known\nto form an ordered crystal, stabilized by a long ranged repulsion, the details\nof this repulsion remain something of a mystery, but all experiments performed\nto date have confirmed a dipolar-repulsion, at least at dilute concentrations.\nMore complex arrangements are often observed, especially at higher\nconcentration, and these seem to be incompatible with a purely repulsive\npotential. In addition to electrostatic repulsion, interfacial particles may\nalso interact via deformation of the surface: so-called capillary effects.\nPair-wise capillary interactions are well understood, and are known to be too\nsmall (for these colloidal particles) to overcome thermal effects. Here we show\nthat collective effects may significantly modify the simple pair-wise\ninteractions and become important at higher density, though we remain well\nbelow close packing throughout. In particular, we show that the interaction of\nmany interfacial particles can cause much larger interfacial deformations than\ndo isolated particles, and show that the energy of interaction per particle due\nto this \"collective sinking\" grows as the number of interacting particles\ngrows. Though some of the parameters in our simple model are unknown, the\nscaling behaviour is entirely consistent with experimental data, strongly\nindicating that estimating interaction energy based solely on pair-wise\npotentials may be too simplistic for surface particle layers.\n", "  We show that in the Higgs triplet model, after the Higgs discovery, the\nmixing angle in the CP-even sector can be strongly constrained from unitarity.\nWe also discuss how large quantum effects in $h\\to\\gamma\\gamma$ may arise in a\nSM-like scenario and a certain part of the parameter space can be ruled out\nfrom the diphoton signal strength. Using $T$-parameter and diphoton signal\nstrength measurements, we update the bounds on the nonstandard scalar masses.\n", "  Experimental and theoretical aspects of Hall-type transport of spins in\nmagnetic insulators are reviewed, with emphasis on their spin chirality origin.\nA general formalism for linear response theory of thermal Hall transport in the\nspin model is developed, which can be applied to both the magnon and the\nparamagnetic, spin-liquid regimes. Recent experiments on magnon-mediated\nthermal Hall transport in the two-dimensional kagome, and three-dimensional\npyrochlore ferromagnetic insulators are reviewed in light of the multi-band\nmagnon theory of Hall transport, and compared to the more mysterious thermal\nHall transport found in the putative quantum spin ice material. As realizations\nof spin-chirality driven magnon transport in the real space, we review the\ngeneral theory of emergent gauge fields governing the magnon dynamics in the\ntextured magnet, and discuss its application to the magnon-Skyrmion scattering\nproblem. Topological magnon Hall effect driven by the Skyrmion texture is\ndiscussed.\n", "  The force estimation problem in quantum metrology with an arbitrary\nnon-Markovian Gaussian bath is considered. No assumptions are made on the bath\nspectrum and coupling strength with the probe. Considering the natural global\nunitary evolution of both bath and probe and assuming initial global Gaussian\nstates we are able to solve the main issues of any quantum metrological\nproblem: the best achievable precision determined by the quantum Fisher\ninformation, the best initial state and the best measurement. Studying the\nshort time behavior and comparing to regular Markovian dynamics we observe an\nincrease of quantum Fisher information. We emphasize that this phenomenon is\ndue to the ability to perform measurements below the correlation time of the\nbath, activating non-Markovian effects. This brings huge consequences for the\nsequential preparation-and- measurement scenario as the quantum Fisher\ninformation becomes unbounded when the initial probe mean energy goes to\ninfinity, whereas its Markovian counterpart remains bounded by a constant. The\nlong time behavior shows the complexity and potential variety of non-Markovian\neffects, somewhere between the exponential decay characteristic of Markovian\ndynamics and the sinusoidal oscillations characteristic of resonant narrow\nbands.\n", "  We prove that Gaussian thermal input states minimize the output von Neumann\nentropy of the one-mode Gaussian quantum-limited attenuator for fixed input\nentropy. The Gaussian quantum-limited attenuator models the attenuation of an\nelectromagnetic signal in the quantum regime. The Shannon entropy of an\nattenuated real-valued classical signal is a simple function of the entropy of\nthe original signal. A striking consequence of energy quantization is that the\noutput von Neumann entropy of the quantum-limited attenuator is no more a\nfunction of the input entropy alone. The proof starts from the majorization\nresult of De Palma et al., IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 62, 2895 (2016), and is\nbased on a new isoperimetric inequality. Our result implies that geometric\ninput probability distributions minimize the output Shannon entropy of the\nthinning for fixed input entropy. Moreover, our result opens the way to the\nmultimode generalization, that permits to determine both the triple trade-off\nregion of the Gaussian quantum-limited attenuator and the classical capacity\nregion of the Gaussian degraded quantum broadcast channel.\n", "  We present exact numerical results for the effects of thermal fluctuations on\nthe experimentally relevant thermodynamic and spectral properties of Peierls\nchains. To this end, a combination of classical Monte Carlo sampling and exact\ndiagonalization is used to study adiabatic half-filled Holstein and\nSu-Schrieffer-Heeger models. The classical nature of the lattice displacements\nin combination with parallel tempering permit simulations on large system sizes\nand a direct calculation of spectral functions in the frequency domain. Most\nnotably, the long-range order and the associated Peierls gap give rise to a\ndistinct low-temperature peak in the specific heat. The closing of the gap and\nsuppression of order by thermal fluctuations involves in-gap excitations in the\nform of soliton-antisoliton pairs, and is also reflected in the dynamic density\nand bond structure factors as well as in the optical conductivity. We compare\nour data to the widely used mean-field approximation, and highlight relations\nto symmetry-protected topological phases and disorder problems.\n", "  Ultrashort electron beams with narrow energy spread, high charge, and low\njitter are essential for resolving phase transitions in metals, semiconductors,\nand molecular crystals. These semirelativistic beams, produced by\nphototriggered electron guns, are also injected into accelerators for x-ray\nlight sources. The achievable resolution of these time-resolved electron\ndiffraction or x-ray experiments has been hindered by surface field and timing\njitter limitations in conventional RF guns, which thus far are <200 MV/m and\n>96 fs, respectively. A gun driven by optically-generated single-cycle THz\npulses provides a practical solution to enable not only GV/m surface fields but\nalso absolute timing stability, since the pulses are generated by the same\nlaser as the phototrigger. Here, we demonstrate an all-optical THz gun yielding\npeak electron energies approaching 1 keV, accelerated by 300 MV/m THz fields in\na novel micron-scale waveguide structure. We also achieve quasimonoenergetic,\nsub-keV bunches with 32 fC of charge, which can already be used for\ntime-resolved low-energy electron diffraction. Such ultracompact, easy to\nimplement guns driven by intrinsically synchronized THz pulses that are pumped\nby an amplified arm of the already present photoinjector laser provide a new\ntool with potential to transform accelerator based science.\n", "  We derive general constraints on the mixing of heavy Seesaw neutrinos with\nthe SM fields from a global fit to present flavour and electroweak precision\ndata. We explore and compare both a completely general scenario, where the\nheavy neutrinos are integrated out without any further assumption, and the more\nconstrained case were only 3 additional heavy states are considered. The latter\nassumption implies non-trivial correlations in order to reproduce the correct\nneutrino masses and mixings as observed by oscillation data and thus some\nqualitative differences can be found with the more general scenario. The\nrelevant processes analyzed in the global fit include searches for Lepton\nFlavour Violating (LFV) decays, probes of the universality of weak\ninteractions, CKM unitarity bounds and electroweak precision data. In\nparticular, a comparative and detailed study of the present and future\nsensitivity of the different LFV experiments is performed. We find a mild\n$1-2\\sigma$ preference for non-zero heavy neutrino mixing of order 0.03-0.04 in\nthe electron and tau sectors. At the $2\\sigma$ level we derive bounds on all\nmixings ranging from 0.1 to 0.01 with the notable exception of the $e-\\mu$\nsector with a more stringent bound of 0.005 from the $\\mu \\to e \\gamma$\nprocess.\n", "  Newtonian gravitational noise from seismic fields is predicted to be a\nlimiting noise source at low frequency for second generation gravitational-wave\ndetectors. Mitigation of this noise will be achieved by Wiener filtering using\narrays of seismometers deployed in the vicinity of all test masses. In this\nwork, we present optimized configurations of seismometer arrays using a variety\nof simplified models of the seismic field based on seismic observations at LIGO\nHanford. The model that best fits the seismic measurements leads to noise\nreduction limited predominantly by seismometer self-noise. A first simplified\ndesign of seismic arrays for Newtonian-noise cancellation at the LIGO sites is\npresented, which suggests that it will be sufficient to monitor surface\ndisplacement inside the buildings.\n", "  We introduce a solution for producing ultrashort ($\\sim$fs) high charge\n($\\sim$pC) from ultra-compact guns utilizing single-cycle THz pulses. We show\nthat the readily available THz pulses with energies as low as 20 ?J are\nsufficient to generate multi-10 keV electron bunches. Moreover, It is\ndemonstrated that THz energies of 2mJ are sufficient to generate relativistic\nelectron bunches with higher than 2 MeV energy. The high acceleration gradients\npossible in the structures provide 30 fs electron bunches at 30 keV energy and\n45 fs bunches at 2 MeV energy. These structures will underpin future devices\nfor strong field THz physics in general and miniaturized electron guns, in\nwhich the high fields combined with the short pulse duration enable electron\nbeams with ultrahigh brightness.\n", "  Computational advantages gained by quantum algorithms rely largely on the\ncoherence of quantum devices and are generally compromised by decoherence. As\nan exception, we present a quantum algorithm for graph isomorphism testing\nwhose performance is optimal when operating in the partially coherent regime,\nas opposed to the extremes of fully coherent or classical regimes. The\nalgorithm builds on continuous-time quantum stochastic walks (QSWs) on graphs\nand the algorithmic performance is quantified by the distinguishing power (DIP)\nbetween non-isomorphic graphs. The QSW explores the entire graph and acquires\ninformation about the underlying structure, which is extracted by monitoring\nstochastic jumps across an auxiliary edge. The resulting counting statistics of\nstochastic jumps is used to identify the spectrum of the dynamical generator of\nthe QSW, serving as a novel graph invariant, based on which non-isomorphic\ngraphs are distinguished. We provide specific examples of non-isomorphic graphs\nthat are only distinguishable by QSWs in the presence of decoherence.\n", "  Motivated by proposed thermometry measurement on an open quantum system, we\npresent a simple model of an externally driven qubit interacting with a finite\nsized, fermion environment acting as calorimeter. The derived dynamics is\ngoverned by a stochastic Schr\\\"odinger equation coupled to the temperature\nchange of the calorimeter. We prove a fluctuation relation and deduce from it a\nnotion of entropy production. Finally, we discuss the first and second law\nassociated to the dynamics.\n", "  Based on recently synthesized Ni3C12S12 class 2D metal-organic frameworks, we\npredict electronic properties of M3C12S12 and M3C12O12, where M is Zn, Cd, Hg,\nBe, or Mg with no M orbital contributions to bands near Fermi level. For\nM3C12S12, their band structures exhibit double Dirac cones with different Fermi\nvelocities that are n and p type, respectively, which are switchable by\nfew-percent strain. The crossing of two cones are symmetry-protected to be\nnon-hybridizing, leading to two independent channels in 2D node-line semimetals\nat the same k-point akin to spin-channels in spintronics, rendering conetronics\ndevice possible. The node line rings right at their crossing, which are both\nelectron and hole pockets at the Fermi level, can give rise to\nmagnetoresistance that will not saturate when the magnetic field is infinitely\nlarge, due to perfect n-p compensation. For M3C12O12, together with conjugated\nmetal-tricatecholate polymers M3(HHTP)2, the spin-polarized slow Dirac cone\ncenter is pinned precisely at the Fermi level, making the systems conducting in\nonly one spin or cone channel. Quantum anomalous Hall effect can arise in MOFs\nwith non-negligible spin-orbit coupling like Cu3C12O12. Compounds of M3C12S12\nand M3C12O12 with different M, can be used to build spintronic and\ncone-selecting heterostructure devices, tunable by strain or electrostatic\ngating.\n", "  We demonstrate the existence of an insulating phase in the three-legged\nHubbard ladder at two-thirds filling. In this phase chargons are bound because\nthe physics within a unit cell favors the formation of triplets. The resultant\nmoments lead to a ground state in the Haldane phase, a symmetry protected\ntopological state of matter. In this purely fermionic model, reflection is\nprotecting but time reversal and dihedral symmetries are not, in contrast to\nspin models.\n", "  In this article we review our angle- and time-resolved photoemission studies\n(ARPES and trARPES) on various ferropnictides.\n", "  We review the theory of orthogonal separation of variables of the\nHamilton-Jacobi equation on spaces of constant curvature, highlighting key\ncontributions to the theory by Benenti. This theory revolves around a special\ntype of conformal Killing tensor, hereafter called a concircular tensor. First,\nwe show how to extend original results given by Benenti to intrinsically\ncharacterize all (orthogonal) separable coordinates in spaces of constant\ncurvature using concircular tensors. This results in the construction of a\nspecial class of separable coordinates known as Kalnins-Eisenhart-Miller\ncoordinates. Then we present the Benenti-Eisenhart-Kalnins-Miller separation\nalgorithm, which uses concircular tensors to intrinsically search for\nKalnins-Eisenhart-Miller coordinates which separate a given natural\nHamilton-Jacobi equation. As a new application of the theory, we show how to\nobtain the separable coordinate systems in the two dimensional spaces of\nconstant curvature, Minkowski and (Anti-)de Sitter space. We also apply the\nBenenti-Eisenhart-Kalnins-Miller separation algorithm to study the separability\nof the three dimensional Calogero-Moser and Morosi-Tondo systems.\n", "  The paper deals with the hyperfine interactions observed on the 57Fe nucleus\nin multiferroic BiFeO3 by means of the 14.41-keV resonant transition in 57Fe,\nand for transmission geometry applied to the random powder sample. Spectra were\nobtained at 80 K, 190 K and at room temperature. It was found that iron occurs\nin the high spin trivalent state. Hyperfine magnetic field follows distribution\ndue to the elliptic-like distortion of the magnetic cycloid. The long axis of\nthe ellipse is oriented along <111> direction of the rhombohedral unit cell.\nThe hyperfine magnetic field in this direction is about 1.013 of the field in\nthe perpendicular direction at room temperature. This ratio diminishes to 1.010\nat 80 K. Axially symmetric electric field gradient (EFG) on the iron atoms has\nthe principal axis oriented in the same direction and the main component of the\nEFG is positive. Our results are consistent with the finding that iron magnetic\nmoments are confined to the [1-21] crystal plane.\n", "  Topological techniques are powerful tools for characterizing the complexity\nof many dynamical systems, including the commonly studied area-preserving maps\nof the plane. However, the extension of many topological techniques to higher\ndimensions is filled with roadblocks preventing their application. This article\nshows how to extend the homotopic lobe dynamics (HLD) technique, previously\ndeveloped for 2D maps, to volume-preserving maps of a three-dimensional phase\nspace. Such maps are physically relevant to particle transport by\nincompressible fluid flows or by magnetic field lines. Specifically, this\nmanuscript shows how to utilize two-dimensional stable and unstable invariant\nmanifolds, intersecting in a heteroclinic tangle, to construct a symbolic\nrepresentation of the topological dynamics of the map. This symbolic\nrepresentation can be used to classify system trajectories and to compute\ntopological entropy. We illustrate the salient ideas through a series of\nexamples with increasing complexity. These examples highlight new features of\nthe HLD technique in 3D. Ultimately, in the final example, our technique\ndetects a difference between the 2D stretching rate of surfaces and the 1D\nstretching rate of curves, illustrating the truly 3D nature of our approach.\n", "  We experimentally investigate the structural, magnetic and electrical\ntransport properties of La$_{0.67}$Sr$_{0.33}$MnO$_{3}$ based magnetic tunnel\njunctions with a SrSnO$_3$ barrier. Our results show that despite the large\nnumber of defects in the strontium stannate barrier, due to the large lattice\nmismatch, the observed tunnel magnetoresistance is comparable to tunnel\njunctions with a better lattice matched STiO$_3$ barrier, reaching values of up\nto 350% at T=5 K. Further analysis of the current-voltage characteristics of\nthe junction and the bias voltage dependence of the observed tunnel\nmagnetoresistance show a decrease of the TMR with increasing bias voltage. In\naddition, the observed TMR vanishes for T>200 K. Our results suggest that by\nemploying a better lattice matched ferromagnetic electrode and thus reducing\nthe structural defects in the strontium stannate barrier even larger TMR ratios\nmight be possible in the future.\n", "  Several methods exist to infer causal networks from massive volumes of\nobservational data. However, almost all existing methods require a considerable\nlength of time series data to capture cause and effect relationships. In\ncontrast, memory-less transition networks or Markov Chain data, which refers to\none-step transitions to and from an event, have not been explored for causality\ninference even though such data is widely available. We find that causal\nnetwork can be inferred from characteristics of four unique distribution zones\naround each event. We call this Composition of Transitions and show that cause,\neffect, and random events exhibit different behavior in their compositions. We\napplied machine learning models to learn these different behaviors and to infer\ncausality. We name this new method Causality Inference using Composition of\nTransitions (CICT). To evaluate CICT, we used an administrative inpatient\nhealthcare dataset to set up a network of patients transitions between\ndifferent diagnoses. We show that CICT is highly accurate in inferring whether\nthe transition between a pair of events is causal or random and performs well\nin identifying the direction of causality in a bi-directional association.\n", "  We review the structure of the conservation laws in noninteracting spin\nchains and unveil a formal expression for the corresponding currents. We\nbriefly discuss how interactions affect the picture. In the second part, we\nexplore the effects of a localized defect. We show that the emergence of\nspontaneous currents near the defect undermines any description of the\nlate-time dynamics by means of a stationary state in a finite chain. In\nparticular, the diagonal ensemble does not work. Finally, we provide numerical\nevidence that simple generic localized defects are not sufficient to induce\nthermalization.\n", "  This paper is aimed to review and promote the main applications of the\nmethods of Quantum Field Theory to description of quantum effects in graphene.\nWe formulate the effective electromagnetic action following from the Dirac\nmodel for the quasiparticles in graphene and apply it for derivation of\ndifferent observable effects like the induced mean charge, quantized\nconductivity, Faraday effect, and Casimir interaction involving graphene\nsamples.\n", "  A model for the $\\bar K d \\to \\pi Y N$ reactions with $Y=\\Lambda, \\Sigma$ is\ndeveloped, aiming at establishing the low-lying $\\Lambda$ and $\\Sigma$ hyperon\nresonances through analyzing the forthcoming data from the J-PARC E31\nexperiment. The off-shell amplitudes generated from the dynamical\ncoupled-channels (DCC) model, which was developed in Kamano et al. [Phys. Rev.\nC 90, 065204 (2014)], are used as input to the calculations of the elementary\n$\\bar K N \\to \\bar K N$ and $\\bar K N \\to \\pi Y$ subprocesses in the $\\bar K d\n\\to \\pi Y N$ reactions. It is shown that the cross sections for the J-PARC E31\nexperiment with a rather high incoming-$\\bar{K}$ momentum, $|\\vec p_{\\bar K}|=\n1$ GeV, can be predicted reliably only when the input $\\bar K N \\to \\bar K N$\namplitudes are generated from a $\\bar KN$ model, such as the DCC model used in\nthis investigation, which describes the data of the $\\bar K N$ reactions at\nenergies far beyond the $\\bar K N$ threshold. We find that the data of the\nthreefold differential cross section $d\\sigma/(dM_{\\pi\\Sigma}d\\Omega_{p_n})$\nfor the $K^- d \\to \\pi \\Sigma n$ reaction below the $\\bar K N$ threshold can be\nused to test the predictions of the resonance poles associated with\n$\\Lambda(1405)$. We also find that the momentum dependence of the threefold\ndifferential cross sections for the $K^- d \\to \\pi^- \\Lambda p$ reaction can be\nused to examine the existence of a low-lying $J^P=1/2^+$ $\\Sigma$ resonance\nwith a pole mass $M_R = 1457 -i39$ MeV, which was found from analyzing the\n$K^-p$ reaction data within the employed DCC model.\n", "  We examine the dynamics of a single hole in the gapless phase of the Kitaev\nhoneycomb model, focusing on the slow-hole regime where the bare hopping\namplitude $t$ is much less than the Kitaev exchange energy $J$. In this regime,\nthe hole does not generate gapped flux excitations and is dressed only by the\ngapless fermion excitations. Investigating the single-hole spectral function,\nwe find that the hole propagates coherently with a quasiparticle weight that is\nfinite but approaches zero as $t/J \\to 0$. This conclusion follows from two\napproximate treatments, which capture the same physics in complementary ways.\nBoth treatments use the stationary limit as an exactly solvable starting point\nto study the spectral function approximately (i) by employing a variational\napproach in terms of a trial state that interpolates between the limits of a\nstationary hole and an infinitely fast hole and (ii) by considering a special\npoint in the gapless phase that corresponds to a simplified one-dimensional\nproblem.\n", "  The isotropic gamma-ray background arises from the contribution of unresolved\nsources, including members of confirmed source classes and proposed gamma-ray\nemitters such as the radiation induced by dark matter annihilation and decay.\nClues about the properties of the contributing sources are imprinted in the\nanisotropy characteristics of the gamma-ray background. We use 81 months of\nPass 7 Reprocessed data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope to perform a\nmeasurement of the anisotropy angular power spectrum of the gamma-ray\nbackground. We analyze energies between 0.5 and 500 GeV, extending the range\nconsidered in the previous measurement based on 22 months of data. We also\ncompute, for the first time, the cross-correlation angular power spectrum\nbetween different energy bins. We find that the derived angular spectra are\ncompatible with being Poissonian, i.e. constant in multipole. Moreover, the\nenergy dependence of the anisotropy suggests that the signal is due to two\npopulations of sources, contributing, respectively, below and above 2 GeV.\nFinally, using data from state-of-the-art numerical simulations to model the\ndark matter distribution, we constrain the contribution from dark matter\nannihilation and decay in Galactic and extragalactic structures to the measured\nanisotropy. These constraints are competitive with those that can be derived\nfrom the average intensity of the isotropic gamma-ray background. Data are\navailable at https://www-glast.stanford.edu/pub_data/552.\n", "  The conventional Perfectly Matched Layer (PML) is unstable for certain kinds\nof anisotropic media. This instability is intrinsic and independent of PML\nformulation or implementation. The Multi-axial PML (MPML) removes such\ninstability using a nonzero damping coefficient in the direction parallel with\nthe interface between a PML and the investigated domain. The damping ratio of\nMPML is the ratio between the damping coefficients along the directions\nparallel with and perpendicular to the interface between a PML and the\ninvestigated domain. No quantitative approach is available for obtaining these\ndamping ratios for general anisotropic media. We develop a quantitative\napproach to determining optimal damping ratios to not only stabilize PMLs, but\nalso minimize the artificial reflections from MPMLs. Numerical tests based on\nfinite-difference method show that our new method can effectively provide a set\nof optimal MPML damping ratios for elastic-wave propagation in 2D and 3D\ngeneral anisotropic media.\n", "  We propose a Berry phase effect on the chiral degrees of freedom of a\ntriangular magnetic molecule. The phase is induced by adiabatically varying an\nexternal electric field in the plane of the molecule via a spin-electric\ncoupling mechanism present in these frustrated magnetic molecules. The Berry\nphase effect depends on spin-orbit interaction splitting and on the electric\ndipole moment. By varying the amplitude of the applied electric field, the\nBerry phase difference between the two spin states can take any arbitrary value\nbetween zero and $\\pi$, which can be measured as a phase shift between the two\nchiral states by using spin-echo techniques. Our result can be used to realize\nan electric field induced geometric phase-shift gate acting on a chiral qubit\nencoded in the ground state manifold of the triangular magnetic molecule.\n", "  In multiplex networks, cycles cannot be characterized only by their length,\nas edges may occur in different layers in different combinations. We define a\nclassification of cycles by the number of edges in each layer and the number of\nswitches between layers. We calculate the expected number of cycles of each\ntype in the configuration model of a large sparse multiplex network. Our method\naccounts for the full degree distribution including correlations between\ndegrees in different layers. In particular, we obtain the numbers of cycles of\nlength 3 of all possible types. Using these, we give a complete set of\nclustering coefficients and their expected values. We show that correlations\nbetween the degrees of a vertex in different layers strongly affect the number\nof cycles of a given type, and the number of switches between layers. Both\nincrease with assortative correlations and are strongly decreased by\ndisassortative correlations. The effect of correlations on clustering\ncoefficients is equally pronounced.\n", "  We present a measurement and analysis scheme for determining traceable\nthermodynamic temperature at cryogenic temperatures using Coulomb blockade\nthermometry. The uncertainty of the electrical measurement is improved by\nutilizing two sampling digital voltmeters instead of the traditional lock-in\ntechnique. The remaining uncertainty is dominated by that of the numerical\nanalysis of the measurement data. Two analysis methods are demonstrated:\nnumerical fitting of the full conductance curve and measuring the height of the\nconductance dip. The complete uncertainty analysis shows that using either\nanalysis method the relative combined standard uncertainty (k = 1) in\ndetermining the thermodynamic temperature in the temperature range from 20 mK\nto 200 mK is below 0.5 %. In this temperature range, both analysis methods\nproduced temperature estimates that deviated from 0.39 % to 0.67 % from the\nreference temperatures provided by a superconducting reference point device\ncalibrated against the Provisional Low Temperature Scale of 2000.\n", "  In the absence of a fermion sign problem, auxiliary field (or determinantal)\nquantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) approaches have long been the numerical method of\nchoice for unbiased, large-scale simulations of interacting many-fermion\nsystems. More recently, the conceptual scope of this approach has been expanded\nby introducing ingenious schemes to compute entanglement entropies within its\nframework. On a practical level, these approaches however suffer from a variety\nof numerical instabilities that have largely impeded their applicability. Here\nwe report on a number of algorithmic advances to overcome many of these\nnumerical instabilities and significantly improve the calculation of\nentanglement measures in the zero-temperature projective DQMC approach,\nultimately allowing to reach similar system sizes as for the computation of\nconventional observables. We demonstrate the applicability of this improved\nDQMC approach by providing an entanglement perspective on the quantum phase\ntransition from a magnetically ordered Mott insulator to a band insulator in\nthe bilayer square lattice Hubbard model at half filling.\n", "  We present a new method of constructing a fully robust qubit in a three-level\nsystem. By the application of continuous driving fields, robustness to both\nexternal and controller noise is achieved. Specifically, magnetic noise and\npower fluctuations do not operate within the robust qubit subspace. Whereas all\nthe continuous driving based constructions of such a fully robust qubit\nconsidered so far have required at least four levels, we show that in fact only\nthree levels are necessary. This paves the way for simple constructions of a\nfully robust qubit in many atomic and solid state systems that are controlled\nby either microwave or optical fields. We focus on the NV-center in diamond and\nanalyze the implementation of the scheme, by utilizing the electronic spin\nsub-levels of its ground state. In current state-of-the-art experimental setups\nthe scheme leads to improvement of more than two orders of magnitude in\ncoherence time, pushing it towards the lifetime limit. We show how the fully\nrobust qubit can be used to implement quantum sensing, and in particular, the\nsensing of high frequency signals.\n", "  Trace charge imbalances can explain puzzling cosmological observations such\nas the large `missing' fraction of electrons in cosmic rays and their contrast\nto the charge-neutral solar wind, the extreme energy sources that sustain\npulsars, quasars, galactic jets and active galactic nuclei (AGN), the origin\nand nature of `dark matter' galaxy haloes, and the apparent acceleration of the\nexpansion of the Universe. When there are $\\sim \\num{9e-19}$ amounts of excess\n$\\ce{H3+}$ or $\\ce{H-}$ within cold diffuse clouds of $\\ce{H2}$, residual\nrepulsive Coulomb forces between these few unbalanced charges are comparable to\nthe gravitational attractions between the many nucleons. Thus, trace-charged\ndark matter is inert with respect to static electrogravitional\nself-attractions, but responds to electromagnetic fields and gravitational\nattractions with uncharged matter. Trace charge is also the ionic catalyst that\nkeeps dark matter in the state of unseen clouds of cold molecular hydrogen plus\ntrace $\\ce{H3+}$. Once warm enough to partially ionize, bright matter\npreferentially expels its net charge to become nearly charge-neutral. Planets\nsurrounding stars become charge neutral as they bathe in a charge-neutral\nstellar wind. In contrast, around trace-charged AGNs, black holes, and\npulsars,newly ionized protons along with a significant fraction of entrained\ndark matter are Coulomb-expelled to relativistic velocities in polar jets.\nExtrasolar cosmic rays generated by these would be strongly proton-dominated,\nas observed. Initial trace charge imbalances could originate at the onset of\nthe the Big Bang by segregation of an electron-rich shell to peripheral\nexpanding matter of the Universe.\n", "  We have measured continuum flux densities of a high-mass protostar candidate,\na radio source I in the Orion KL region (Orion Source I) using the Atacama\nLarge Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) at band 8 with an angular\nresolution of 0.1\". The continuum emission at 430, 460, and 490 GHz associated\nwith Source I shows an elongated structure along the northwest-southeast\ndirection perpendicular to the so-called low-velocity bipolar outflow. The\ndeconvolved size of the continuum source, 90 au times 20 au, is consistent with\nthose reported previously at other millimeter/submillimeter wavelength. The\nflux density can be well fitted to the optically thick black-body spectral\nenergy distribution (SED), and the brightness temperature is evaluated to be\n700-800 K. It is much lower than that in the case of proton-electron or H-\nfree-free radiations. Our data are consistent with the latest ALMA results by\nPlambeck & Wright (2016), in which the continuum emission have been proposed to\narise from the edge-on circumstellar disk via thermal dust emission, unless the\ncontinuum source consists of an unresolved structure with the smaller beam\nfilling factor.\n", "  A combination of measurements sensitive to the CKM angle $\\gamma$ from LHCb\nis performed. The inputs are from analyses of time-integrated $B^{+}\\rightarrow\nDK^+$, $B^{0} \\rightarrow D K^{*0}$, $B^{0} \\rightarrow D K^+ \\pi^-$ and $B^{+}\n\\rightarrow D K^+\\pi^+\\pi^-$ tree-level decays. In addition, results from a\ntime-dependent analysis of $B_{s}^{0} \\rightarrow D_{s}^{\\mp}K^{\\pm}$ decays\nare included. The combination yields $\\gamma = (72.2^{+6.8}_{-7.3})^\\circ$,\nwhere the uncertainty includes systematic effects. The 95.5% confidence level\ninterval is determined to be $\\gamma \\in [55.9,85.2]^\\circ$. A second\ncombination is investigated, also including measurements from $B^{+}\n\\rightarrow D \\pi^+$ and $B^{+} \\rightarrow D \\pi^+\\pi^-\\pi^+$ decays, which\nyields compatible results.\n", "  Multiquark resonances are undoubtedly experimentally observed. The number of\nstates and the amount of details on their properties has been growing over the\nyears. It is very recent the discovery of two pentaquarks and the confirmation\nof four tetraquarks, two of which had not been observed before. We mainly\nreview the theoretical understanding of this sector of particle physics\nphenomenology and present some considerations attempting a coherent description\nof the so called X and Z resonances. The prominent problems plaguing\ntheoretical models, like the absence of selection rules limiting the number of\nstates predicted, motivate new directions in model building. Data are reviewed\ngoing through all of the observed resonances with particular attention to their\ncommon features and the purpose of providing a starting point to further\nresearch.\n", "  The chloroniumyl cation, HCl$^+$, has been recently identified in space from\nHerschel's spectra. A joint analysis of extensive vis-UV spectroscopy emission\ndata together with a few high resolution and high accuracy mm-wave data\nprovided the necessary rest frequencies to support the astronomical\nidentification. Nevertheless, the analysis did not include any infrared\nvibration-rotation data. Furthermore, with the end of the Herschel mission,\ninfrared observations from ground may be one of the few available means to\nfurther study this ion in space. In this work we provide a set of accurate\nrovibrational transition wavenumbers as well as a new and improved global fit\nof vis-UV, IR and mm-wave spectroscopy laboratory data, that will aid in future\nstudies of this molecule.\n", "  We propose type-II GaAsSb/GaAsN superlattices (SLs) lattice-matched to GaAs\nas a novel material for the 1 eV sub-cells present in highly efficient\nGaAs/Ge-based multi-junction solar cells. We demonstrate that, among other\nbenefits, the spatial separation of Sb and N allows a better control over\ncomposition and lattice matching, avoiding the growth problems related to the\nconcomitant presence of both elements in GaAsSbN layers. This approach not only\nreduces clustering and improves crystal quality and interface abruptness, but\nalso allows for additional control of the effective bandgap in the 1.0-1.15 eV\nspectral region through the SL period thickness. The optimized SL structure\nexhibits a type-II band alignment and strong electronic coupling at 0 V. Both\neffects cooperate to increase the minority carrier collection and leads to a\nnet strong enhancement of the external quantum efficiency (EQE) under\nphotovoltaic conditions with respect to bulk layers of equivalent thickness.\n", "  We report an anomalous decoherence phenomenon of a quantum dissipative system\nin the framework of a stochastic decoupling scheme along with a hierarchical\nequations-of-motion formalism without the usual Born-Markov or weak coupling\napproximations. It is found that the decoherence of a two-qubit spin-boson\nmodel can be reduced by increasing the bath temperature in strong-coupling\nregimes. For the weak-coupling situation, we find that the bath temperature may\nenhance the decoherence. This result is contrary to the common recognition that\na higher bath temperature always induces a more severe decoherence and suggests\nthat a decoherence dynamical transition occurs in this two-qubit spin-boson\nmodel. We also demonstrate that the critical transition point can be\ncharacterized by the behavior of the frequency spectrum of the quantum\ncoherence indicator.\n", "  We describe an algorithm that for every given braid $B$ explicitly constructs\na function $f:\\mathbb{C}^{2}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{C}$ such that $f$ is a\npolynomial in $u$, $v$ and $\\overline{v}$ and the zero level set of $f$ on the\nunit three-sphere is the closure of $B$. The nature of this construction allows\nus to prove certain properties of the constructed polynomials. In particular,\nwe provide bounds on the degree of $f$ in terms of braid data.\n", "  We have constrained the spatial variation of the fine structure constant\nusing multi-frequency measurements of the thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect of\n618 X-ray selected clusters. Although our results are not competitive with the\nones from quasar absorption lines, we improved by a factor 10 and ~2.5 previous\nresults from Cosmic Microwave Background power spectrum and from galaxy\nclusters, respectively.\n", "  This thesis concerns research undertaken in two related topics concerning\nhigh-energy gravitational physics. The first is the construction of a\nmanifestly diffeomorphism-invariant Exact Renormalization Group (ERG). This is\na procedure that constructs effective theories of gravity by integrating out\nhigh-energy modes down to an ultraviolet cutoff scale without gauge-fixing. The\nmanifest diffeomorphism invariance enables us to construct a fully\nbackground-independent formulation. This thesis will explore both the\nfixed-background and background-independent forms of the manifestly\ndiffeomorphism-invariant ERG. The second topic is cosmological backreaction,\nwhich concerns the effect of averaging over high-frequency metric perturbations\nto the gravitational field equations describing the universe at large scales.\nThis has been much studied the context of the unmodified form of General\nRelativity, but has been much less studied in the context of higher-derivative\neffective theories obtained by integrating out the high-energy modes of some\nmore fundamental (quantum) theory of gravity. The effective stress-energy\ntensor for backreaction can be used directly as a diffeomorphism-invariant\neffective stress-energy tensor for gravitational waves without specifying the\nbackground metric.\n  This thesis will construct the manifestly diffeomorphism-invariant ERG and\ncompute the effective action at the classical level in two different schemes.\nWe will then turn to cosmological backreaction in higher-derivative gravity,\nderiving the general form of the effective stress-energy tensor due to\ninhomogeneity for local diffeomorphism-invariant effective theories of gravity.\nThis an exciting research direction, as it begins the construction of a quantum\ntheory of gravity as well as investigating possible implications for cosmology.\n", "  These notes are based on a lecture given at the 2016 Euclid Summer School in\nNarbonne. I will first give a quick overview of the concept of nuisance\nparameters in the context of large galaxy surveys. The second part will examine\nthe case study of intrinsic alignments, a potential important contamination of\nweak lensing observables.\n", "  We investigate the electronic dynamics of a model organic photovoltaic (OPV)\nsystem consisting of polyphenylene vinylene (PPV) oligomers and a [6,6]-phenyl\nC61-butyric acid methylester (PCBM) blend using a mixed molecular\nmechanics/quantum mechanics (MM/QM) approach. Using a heuristic model that\nconnects energy gap fluctuations to the average electronic couplings and\ndecoherence times, we provide and estimate of the state-to-state internal\nconversion rates within the manifold of the lowest few electronic excitations.\nWe show that the electronic dynamics of the OPV are dramatically altered by\nvarying the positions of the molecules simulated at the interface. The lowest\nfew excited states of the model interface rapidly mix allowing low frequency\nC-C out of plain torsions to modulate the potential energy surface such that\nthe system can sample both intermolecular charge-transfer and charge-separated\nelectronic configurations on sub 100 fs time scales. Our simulations support an\nemerging picture of carrier generation in OPV systems in which interfacial\nelectronic states can rapidly decay into charge-separated and current producing\nstates via coupling to vibronic degrees of freedom.\n", "  Oscillators coupled in a network can synchronize with each other to yield a\ncoherent population rhythm. If multiple such networks are coupled together, the\nquestion arises whether these rhythms will synchronize. We investigate the\nimpact of noise on this synchronization for strong inhibitory pulse-coupling\nand find that increasing the noise can synchronize the population rhythms, even\nif the noisy inputs to different oscillators are completely uncorrelated.\nReducing the system to a phenomenological iterated map we show that this\nsynchronization of the rhythms arises from the noise-induced phase\nheterogeneity of the oscillators. The synchronization of population rhythms is\nexpected to be particularly relevant for brain rhythms.\n", "  We present a novel {\\em ab initio} approach for computing intramolecular\ncharge and energy transfer rates based upon a projection operator scheme that\nparses out specific internal nuclear motions that accompany the electronic\ntransition. Our approach concentrates the coupling between the electronic and\nnuclear degrees of freedom into a small number of reduced harmonic modes that\ncan be written as linear combinations of the vibrational normal modes of the\nmolecular system about a given electronic minima. Using a time-convolutionless\nmaster-equation approach, parameterized by accurate quantum-chemical methods,\nwe benchmark the approach against experimental results and predictions from\nMarcus theory for triplet energy transfer for a series of donor-bridge-acceptor\nsystems. We find that using only a single reduced mode--termed the \"primary\"\nmode, one obtains an accurate evaluation of the golden-rule rate constant and\ninsight into the nuclear motions responsible for coupling the initial and final\nelectronic states. We demonstrate the utility of the approach by computing the\ninelastic electronic transition rates in a model donor-bridge-acceptor complex\nthat has been experimentally shown that its exciton transfer pathway can be\nradically modified by mode-specific infrared excitation of its vibrational\nmode.\n", "  X-ray binary observations led to the interpretation that powerful compact\njets, produced in the hard state, are quenched when the source transitions to\nits soft state. The aim of this paper is to discuss the possibility that a\npowerful dark jet is still present in the soft state. Using the black hole\nX-ray binaries GX339-4 and H1743-322 as test cases, we feed observed X-ray\npower density spectra in the soft state of these two sources to an internal\nshock jet model. Remarkably, the predicted radio emission is consistent with\ncurrent upper-limits. Our results show that, for these two sources, a compact\ndark jet could persist in the soft state with no major modification of its\nkinetic power compared to the hard state.\n", "  Cells in tissues can organize into a broad spectrum of structures according\nto their function. Drastic changes of organization, such as\nepithelial-mesenchymal transitions or the formation of spheroidal aggregates,\nare often associated either to tissue morphogenesis or to cancer progression.\nHere, we study the organization of cell colonies by means of simulations of\nself-propelled particles with generic cell-like interactions. The interplay\nbetween cell softness, cell-cell adhesion, and contact inhibition of locomotion\n(CIL) yields structures and collective dynamics observed in several existing\ntissue phenotypes. These include regular distributions of cells, dynamic cell\nclusters, gel-like networks, collectively migrating monolayers, and 3D\naggregates. We give analytical predictions for transitions between noncohesive,\ncohesive, and 3D cell arrangements. We explicitly show how CIL yields an\neffective repulsion that promotes cell dispersal, thereby hindering the\nformation of cohesive tissues. Yet, in continuous monolayers, CIL leads to\ncollective cell motion, ensures tensile intercellular stresses, and opposes\ncell extrusion. Thus, our work highlights the prominent role of CIL in\ndetermining the emergent structures and dynamics of cell colonies.\n", "  Non-mass dependent chromium isotopic signatures have been successfully used\nto determine the presence and identification of extra-terrestrial materials in\nterrestrial impact rocks. Paleoproterozoic spherule layers from Greenland\n(Graenseso) and Russia (Zaonega), as well as some distal ejecta deposits (Lake\nSuperior region) from the Sudbury impact (1,849 +/- 0.3 Ma) event, have been\nanalyzed for their Cr isotope compositions. Our results suggest that 1) these\ndistal ejecta deposits are all of impact origin, 2) the Graenseso and Zaonega\nspherule layers contain a distinct carbonaceous chondrite component, and are\npossibly related to the same impact event, which could be Vredefort (2,023 +/-\n4 Ma) or another not yet identified large impact event from that of similar\nage, and 3) the Sudbury ejecta record a complex meteoritic signature, which is\ndifferent from the Graenseso and Zaonega spherule layers, and could indicate\nthe impact of a heterogeneous chondritic body.\n", "  We report Spitzer Space Telescope IRAC 3.6, 4.5, 5.8 and 8 um and MIPS 24 and\n70 um observations of the 32 Ori Group, a recently discovered nearby stellar\nassociation situated towards northern Orion. The proximity of the group (~93\npc) has enabled a sensitive search for circumstellar dust around group members,\nand its age (~20 Myr) corresponds roughly to an epoch thought to be important\nfor terrestrial planet formation in our own solar system. We quantify infrared\nexcess emission due to circumstellar dust among group members, utilizing\navailable optical (e.g. Hipparcos, Tycho) and near-IR (2MASS) photometry in\naddition to the Spitzer IR photometry. We report 4 out of the 14 objects which\nexhibit 24 um excess emission more than 4\\sigma above the stellar photosphere\n(>20%) though lacking excess emission at shorter wavelengths: HD 35656 (A0Vn),\nHD 36338 (F4.5), RX J0520.5+0616 (K3), and HD 35499 (F4). Two objects (HD 35656\nand RX J0520.0+0612) have 70 um excesses, although the latter lacks 24 um\nexcess emission. The 24 um disk fraction of this group is 29(+14,-9%), which is\nsimilar to previous findings for groups of comparable ages and places 32 Ori as\nthe young stellar group with the 2nd most abundant 24 um excesses among groups\nlacking accreting T Tauri stars (behind only the approximately coeval Beta Pic\nMoving Group). We also model the infrared excess emission using circumstellar\ndust disk models, placing constraints on disk parameters including L_IR/L_*,\nT_disk, characteristic grain distance, and emitting area. The L_IR/L_* values\nfor all the stars can be reasonably explained by steady state disk evolution.\n", "  The photon motion in a Michelson interferometer is re-analyzed in both\ngeometrical optics and wave optics. The classical paths of the photons in the\nbackground of gravitational wave are derived from Fermat principle, which is\nthe same as the null geodesics in general relativity. The deformed Maxwell\nequations and the wave equations of electric fields in the background of\ngravitational wave are presented in flat-space approximation. Both methods show\nthat the response of an interferometer depends on the frequency of a\ngravitational wave, however it is almost independent of the frequency of the\nmirror's vibrations. It implies that the vibrating mirror cannot mimic a\ngravitational wave very well.\n", "  We present the results of photometric observations of the mutual phenomena in\nthe system of Galilean satellites obtained during 2014-2015. The observations\nwere performed using the 26-inch refractor, Normal Astrograph, ZA-320 telescope\nof the Pulkovo Observatory (084) and MTM-500 telescope at Pulkovo mountain\nstation at Kislovodsk (C20). We made observations a total of 72 phenomena. We\nhad derived 51 light curves of good and medium quality for 34 events. The RMS\nof determining the brightness is within a range from 0.02 to 0.19 mag, the\naverage RMS is 0.06 mag. This work was supported by RFBR grant (project\n15-02-03025).\n", "  Using a relation between the thermodynamics of local horizons and the null\nenergy condition, we consider the effects of quantum corrections to the\ngravitational entropy. In particular, we find that the geometric form of the\nnull energy condition is not affected by the inclusion of logarithmic\ncorrections to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy.\n", "  Spin-torque induced magnetization dynamics in a spin-torque oscillator with\nan in-plane (IP) magnetized free layer and an out-of-plane (OP) magnetized\npolarizer under IP shape-anisotropy field ($H_{\\rm k}$) and applied IP magnetic\nfield ($H_{\\rm a}$) was theoretically studied based on the macrospin model. The\nrigorous analytical expression of the critical current density ($J_{\\rm c1}$)\nfor the OP precession was obtained. The obtained expression successfully\nreproduces the experimentally obtained $H_{\\rm a}$-dependence of $J_{\\rm c1}$\nreported in [D. Houssameddine $et$ $al$., Nat. Mater. 6, 447 (2007)].\n", "  Chiral anomaly is a very fundamental aspect of quantum theories with chiral\nfermion, from the Standard Model to supersymmetric field theories or even\nstring theories. How such microscopic anomaly manifests itself in a macroscopic\nmany-body system with chiral fermions, is a highly nontrivial question that has\nrecently attracted significant interest. As it turns out, unusual transport\ncurrents can be induced by chiral anomaly under suitable conditions in such\nsystems, with the notable example of the Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME) where a\nvector current (e.g. electric current) is generated along an external magnetic\nfield. The CME has been enthusiastically studied in two very different physical\nsystems: the Dirac and Weyl semimetals in condensed matter physics as well as\nthe quark-gluon plasma in heavy ion collisions. In this contribution, we report\nthe latest theoretical and experimental status for the search of CME in heavy\nion collisions.\n", "  The behavior of quantum speed limit time (QSLT) for a single free spin $-1/2$\nparticle described by Gaussian wavepackets in the framework of relativity under\ndephasing noise is investigated. The dephasing noise acts only on the spin\ndegrees of freedom of the spin$-1/2$ particle. In particular, the effects of\ninitial time parameter, rapidity, average momentum and the size of the\nwavepackets in the presence of the dephasing noise on the dynamics of evolution\nprocess are studied. In general, the effects of relativity monotonically\ndecrease the QSLT in time. In the range of large values of average momentum,\ncritical values of both the rapidity and the size of the wavepackets exist at\nwhich the QSLT has its minimum value. In the range of small values of the\naverage momentum, the QSLT monotonically decreases with both rapidity and the\nsize of the wavepackets. The decrease of QSLT in a particular range of rapidity\nand with other relative parameters may be of great interest in employing fast\nquantum communication and quantum computation.\n", "  The dynamics of entanglement and quantum discord for qubit-qutrit systems are\nstudied in the presence of phase damping and amplitude damping noises. Both one\nway and two couplings of the marginal systems with the environments are\nconsidered. Entanglement sudden death is unavoidable under any setup, however,\nthe required time span depends on the way of coupling. On the other hand, the\ndynamics of quantum discord strongly depends both on the nature of environment\nand on the number of dimensions of the Hilbert space of the coupled marginal\nsystem. We show that freezing and invariance of quantum discord, as previously\nreported in the literature, are limited to some special cases. Most\nimportantly, it is noted that under some particular coupling the existence of\nenvironment can guarantee the generation of nonclassical correlations.\n", "  We analyze the observed radial distribution of column densities of water-ice\nparticulates embedded in the primary jet region of 103Ps inner coma at\naltitudes between 439 and 1967 m (Protopapa et al, 2014) and determine the\nspeed and acceleration of particles and their mass flow within the filaments of\nthe jet. This is done by applying a CO2 driven type IIa jet model proposed by\nBelton (2010) The model utilizes water-ice particles dislodged in the source\nregions of the jet filaments and accelerated by CO2 to explain the radial\ndistribution of water-ice particulates. We provide an explanation for the\nremarkably different radial distribution of refractory dust particles by\nhypothesizing that the majority of the dust originates directly from the\nnucleus surface in interfilament regions of the jet complex and is accelerated\nby H2O. Our model provides a mass-flow of water from the J1 jet complex that is\n40 times greater than the constant speed sublimation model discussed by\nProtopapa et al. but is still too small to explain the hyperactivity of the\ncomet. Speeds in the flow are increased by a factor up to 20 over those found\nby Protopapa et al. To account for the hyperactivity, most of the mass\ndislodged in the filament source regions must be in weakly accelerated large\nchunks that achieve only low speeds en route to the region of observation.\nThese chunks soon leave the filamentary jet structure due to the rotation of\nthe nucleus and do not contribute to the column densities observed at higher\naltitudes in the jet filaments.\n", "  The unification scheme of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) invokes an optically\nthick molecular torus component hiding the broad emission line region. Assuming\nthe presence of a thick neutral component in the molecular torus characterized\nby a \\ion{H}{I} column density > $10^{22}{\\rm\\ cm^{-2}}$, we propose that far\nUV radiation around Ly$\\alpha$ can be significantly polarized through Rayleigh\nscattering. Adopting a Monte Carlo technique we compute polarization of\nRayleigh scattered radiation near Ly$\\alpha$ in a thick neutral region in the\nshape of a slab and a cylindrical shell. It is found that radiation near\nLy$\\alpha$ Rayleigh reflected from a very thick slab can be significantly\npolarized in a fairly large range of wavelength $\\Delta\\lambda\\sim 50$ \\AA\\\nexhibiting a flux profile similar to the incident one. Rayleigh transmitted\nradiation in a slab is characterized by the central dip with a complicated\npolarization behavior. The optically thick part near Ly$\\alpha$ center is\npolarized in the direction perpendicular to the slab normal, which is in\ncontrast to weakly polarized wing parts in the direction parallel to the slab\nnormal. A similar polarization flip phenomenon is also found in the case of a\ntall cylindrical shell, in which the spatial diffusion along the vertical\ndirection near the inner cylinder wall for core photons leads to a tendency of\nthe electric field aligned to the direction perpendicular to the vertical axis.\nObservational implications are briefly discussed including spectropolarimetry\nof the quasar PG~1630+377 by Koratkar et al. in 1990 where Ly$\\alpha$ is\nstrongly polarized with no other emission lines polarized.\n", "  We apply the Postprocessing Galerkin method to a recently introduced\ncontinuous data assimilation (downscaling) algorithm for obtaining a numerical\napproximation of the solution of the two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations\ncorresponding to given measurements from a coarse spatial mesh. Under suitable\nconditions on the relaxation (nudging) parameter, the resolution of the coarse\nspatial mesh and the resolution of the numerical scheme, we obtain uniform in\ntime estimates for the error between the numerical approximation given by the\nPostprocessing Galerkin method and the reference solution corresponding to the\nmeasurements. Our results are valid for a large class of interpolant operators,\nincluding low Fourier modes and local averages over finite volume elements.\nNotably, we use here the 2D Navier-Stokes equations as a paradigm, but our\nresults apply equally to other evolution equations, such as the Boussinesq\nsystem of Benard convection and other oceanic and atmospheric circulation\nmodels.\n", "  Meeting the ever increasing demand for transmission capacity in wireless\nnetworks will require evolving towards higher regions in the radiofrequency\nspectrum, reducing cell sizes as well as resorting to more compact, agile and\npower efficient equipment at the base stations, capable of smoothly interfacing\nthe radio and fiber segments. Photonic chips with fully functional microwave\nphotonic systems are promising candidates to achieve these targets. Over the\nlast years, many integrated microwave photonic chips have been reported in\ndifferent technologies. However, and to the best of our knowledge, none of them\nhave fully integrated all the required active and passive components. Here, we\nreport the first ever demonstration of a microwave photonics tunable filter\ncompletely integrated in an Indium Phosphide chip and packaged. The chip\nimplements a reconfigurable RF- photonic filter, it includes all the required\nelements, such as lasers, modulators and photodetectors, and its response can\nbe tuned by means of control electric currents. This demonstration is a\nfundamental step towards the feasibility of compact and fully programmable\nintegrated microwave photonic processors.\n", "  Spin transitions driven by a periodically varying electric potential in\ndilute fluorinated graphene quantum dots are investigated. Flakes of monolayer\ngraphene are considered as well as electrostatic electron traps induced in\nbilayer graphene. The stationary states are obtained within the tight-binding\napproach and are used to the basis of eigenstates to describe the system\ndynamics. The dilute fluorination of the top layer lifts the valley degeneracy\nof the confined states and attenuates the orbital magnetic dipole moments due\nto current circulation within the flake. Moreover, the spin-orbit coupling\nintroduced by the surface deformation of the top layer induced by the adatoms\nallows spin flips to be driven by the AC electric field. For the bilayer\nquantum dots the spin flip times is substantially shorter than the experimental\nspin relaxation. Dynamical effects including many-photon and multilevel\ntransitions are also discussed.\n", "  In this work we have calculated analytically the work extraction in\nmulti-particle Szilard engine. Unlike the previous studies, here we have\nintroduced the biasing in the measurement procedure by inserting the partition\nat an arbitrary distance from the boundary. We found the work extraction to be\nsymmetric with respect to a position- which is half way between the boundary\nwalls. The work extraction is also calculated as a function of number of\nparticles and it shows to saturate to a certain value for large number of\nparticles. We find that work extraction can be made larger for multi-particle\nengine when the partition is inserted in the middle.\n", "  In this paper we simulated the behavior of a simple ADS model, based on MOX\nfuel embedded in solid lead, in terms of multiplication coefficient keff,\nthermal power and absolute neutron spectra. In the first part of the paper, we\nreport on the results obtained when modifying the reflector surrounding the\nfission core, by replacing pure lead with a layered graphite/lead structure. We\nfound that, by appropriately choosing position and thickness of the graphite\nand lead layers, it is possible to obtain a hybrid system where the neutron\nspectrum in the core still exhibits a fast character, while the spectrum in the\ngraphite layer is considerably softer, becoming thermal in the most peripheral\npositions. In order to obtain such a modulation of the neutron spectra from the\ncenter of the system to the periphery, a careful choice of the materials has to\nbe made in order to avoid large variations of the local power at the core\nboundary. However, the smoothness of the power distribution is obtained at the\nexpense of lower values of keff and the total power of the system. In the\nsecond part of the paper, we explored the option of adopting light water as\ncoolant, instead of the helium gas assumed in the initial design. We found that\nthis produces an increase in keff and thermal power, without significantly\nperturbing the fast character of the system and without introducing spatial\npower excursions in any place within the core. The characteristics obtained may\nallow to design a system where fast, mixed and thermal spectra can be used to\nexpand the use of the ADS as an irradiation facility.\n", "  We investigate the width complexity of nondeterministic unitary OBDDs\n(NUOBDDs). Firstly, we present a generic lower bound on their widths based on\nthe size of strong 1-fooling sets. Then, we present classically cheap functions\nthat are expensive for NUOBDDs and vice versa by improving the previous gap. We\nalso present a function for which neither classical nor unitary nondeterminism\ndoes help. Moreover, based on our results, we present a width hierarchy for\nNUOBDDs. Lastly, we provide the bounds on the widths of NUOBDDs for the basic\nBoolean operations negation, union, and intersection.\n", "  The appearance of nuclear clusters in stellar matter at densities below\nnuclear saturation is an important feature in the modeling of the equation of\nstate for astrophysical applications. There are different theoretical concepts\nto describe the dissolution of nuclei with increasing density and temperature.\nIn this contribution, the predictions of two approaches are compared: the\nmedium dependent change of the nuclear masses in a generalized relativistic\ndensity functional approach and the excluded-volume mechanism in a statistical\nmodel. Both approaches use the same description for the interaction between the\nnucleons. The composition of neutron star matter, in particular the occurrence\nof light and heavy nuclei, and its thermodynamic properties are studied.\n", "  Topological crystalline insulators are materials in which the crystalline\nsymmetry leads to topologically protected surface states with a chiral spin\ntexture, rendering them potential candidates for spintronics applications.\nUsing scanning tunneling spectroscopy, we uncover the existence of\none-dimensional (1D) midgap states at odd-atomic surface step edges of the\nthree- dimensional topological crystalline insulator (Pb,Sn)Se. A minimal toy\nmodel and realistic tight- binding calculations identify them as spin-polarized\nflat bands connecting two Dirac points. This non-trivial origin provides the 1D\nmidgap states with inherent stability and protects them from backscattering. We\nexperimentally show that this stability results in a striking robustness to\ndefects, strong magnetic fields, and elevated temperature.\n", "  Epitaxial films have the potential to be used as model systems for\nfundamental investigations on the martensitic transformation in binary NiTi. In\nthis paper, we discuss growth of binary NiTi thin films on single crystalline\nMgO substrates. Sputter deposition is used to grow NiTi films. Films prepared\nby complementary preparation routes (with different deposition temperatures and\nsubsequent heat treatments) are investigated by X-ray diffraction, electron\nmicroscopy, atomic force microscopy, and electrical resistivity measurements,\nwith the aim of optimizing film properties, particularly to obtain a well\ndefined orientation of the austenitic unit cell and smooth surfaces. Our\nresults show that deposition at elevated temperatures and carefully controlled\nsubsequent heat treatments allow to produce epitaxially grown and smooth NiTi\nfilms that exhibit reversible one- or two-step martensitic transformations.\n", "  The gradient flow provides a new class of renormalized observables which can\nbe measured with high precision in lattice simulations. In principle this\nallows for many interesting applications to renormalization and improvement\nproblems. In practice, however, such applications are made difficult by the\nrather large cutoff effects found in many gradient flow observables. At lowest\norder of perturbation theory we here study the leading cutoff effects in a\nfinite volume gradient flow coupling with SF and SF-open boundary conditions.\nWe confirm that O($a^2$) Symanzik improvement is achieved at tree-level,\nprovided the action, observable and the flow are O($a^2$) improved. O($a^2$)\neffects from the time boundaries are found to be absent at this order, both\nwith SF and SF-open boundary conditions. For the calculation we have used a\nconvenient representation of the free gauge field propagator at finite flow\ntimes which follows from a recently proposed set-up by L\\\"uscher and renders\nlattice perturbation theory more practical at finite flow time and with SF,\nopen, SF-open or open-SF boundary conditions.\n", "  We develop an approach to prove self-adjointness of Dirac operators with\nboundary or transmission conditions at a $\\mathcal{C}^2$-compact surface\nwithout boundary. To do so we are lead to study the layer potential induced by\nthe Dirac system as well as to define traces in a weak sense for functions in\nthe appropriate Sobolev space. Finally, we introduce Calder\\'on projectors\nassociated with the problem and illustrate the method in two special cases: the\nwell-known MIT bag model and an electrostatic $\\delta$-shell interaction.\n", "  We report on the production of an array of active edge silicon sensors as a\nprototype of a large array. Four Medipix3RX.1 chips were bump bonded to four\nsingle chip sized Advacam active edge n-on-n sensors. These detectors were then\nmounted into a 2 by 2 array and tested on B16 at Diamond Light Source with an\nx-ray beam spot of 2um. The results from these tests, compared with optical\nmetrology give confidence that these sensors are sensitive to the physical edge\nof the sensor, with only a modest loss of efficiency in the final two rows of\npixels. We present the efficiency maps recorded with the microfocus beam and a\nsample powder diffraction measurement. These results give confidence that this\nsensor technology can be used in much larger arrays of detectors at synchrotron\nlight sources.\n", "  The magnetic properties tuning and volume dependence in the series of\nquaternary full Heusler alloys with formula Co2Cr1-xYGa (Y = Ti, V, Mn, Fe, Co,\nNi) were studied with a detailed first-principles exploration. We employ the\ndensity functional KKR method with the coherent potential approximation,\nestimating effective Heisenberg exchange constants via the magnetic force\ntheorem together with mean-field Curie temperature (TC) and magnetic moment for\ncompositions in the whole concentration range. The volumetric dependency of\nthese magnetic properties is studied, particularly the pressure derivatives of\nTC at equilibrium. Our ternary alloy calculations show good agreement with\nlocal-density and generalized gradient approximations in the literature. The\nquaternary alloys show a wide range of tunable magnetic properties, where\nmagnetic moments range from 0.8 to 4.9 mu_B, TC from 130 K to 1250 K, and\ndTC/dV values range from -7 to +6.3 K A-3.\n", "  After direct detection gravitational radiation in 2015 many authors are\npublishing remakes of their old articles about this radiation. I decided to\nfollow this line in my Lecture delivered at the Conference \"Varcosmofun'16\"\n(12-17 September 2016, Szczecin, Poland, EU). Namely, I have presented at this\nConference an updated summary of my past articles on gravitational radiation.\nAs a base for my presentation I have used mainly the article published in 2002\nin Annalen der Physik \\cite{Gar3} and the articles \\cite{Gar4}.\n  In these past articles I have showed that the real gravitational waves which\npossess a non-vanishing Riemann tensor always carry energy-momentum (and also\nangular momentum). Our proof have used canonical superenergy and supermomentum\ntensor for gravitational field in former articles and the averaged relative\nenergy-momentum tensor in latter. In this article we confine to the\nenergy-momentum only.\n", "  The magnetothermopower and the magnetoresistance of single Co Ni/Cu\nmultilayered nan-owires with various thicknesses of the Cu spacer are\ninvestigated. Both kinds of measurement have been performed as a function of\ntemperature (50 K to 325 K) and under applied magnetic fields perpendicular to\nthe nanowire axis, with magnitudes up to 15 % at room temperature. A linear\nrelation between thermopower S and electrical conductivity {\\sigma} of the\nnanowires is found, with the magnetic field as an implicit variable. Combining\nthe linear behavior of the S vs. {\\sigma} and the Mott formula, the energy\nderivative of the resistivity has been determined. In order to extract the true\nnanowire materials parameters from the measured thermopower, a simple model\nbased on the Mott formula is employed to distinguish the individual thermopower\ncontributions of the sample. By assuming that the non-diffusive thermopower\ncontributions of the nanowire can be neglected, it was found that the magnetic\nfield induced changes of thermopower and resistivity are equivalent. The\nemphasis in the present paper is on the comparison of the magnetoresistance and\nmagnetothermopower results and it is found that the same correlation is valid\nbetween the two sets of data for all samples, irrespective of the relative\nimportance of the giant magnetoresistance or anisotropic magnetoresistance\ncontributions in the various individual nanowires.\n", "  We consider finitely generated free semigroup actions on a compact metric\nspace and obtain quantitative information on Poincar\\'e recurrence, average\nfirst return time and hitting frequency for the random orbits induced by the\nsemigroup action. Besides, we relate the recurrence to balls with the rates of\nexpansion of the semigroup's generators and the topological entropy of the\nsemigroup action. Finally, we establish a partial variational principle and\nprove an ergodic optimization for this kind of dynamical action.\n", "  We report a detailed study of the electrical transport properties of single\ncrystals of Pr$_4$Fe$_2$As$_2$Te$_{1-x}$O$_4$, a recently discovered iron-based\nsuperconductor. Resistivity, Hall effect and magnetoresistance are measured in\na broad temperature range revealing the role of electrons as dominant charge\ncarriers. The significant temperature dependence of the Hall coefficient and\nthe violation of Kohler's law indicate multiband effects in this compound. The\nupper critical field and the magnetic anisotropy are investigated in fields up\nto 16 T, applied parallel and perpendicular to the crystallographic c-axis.\nHydrostatic pressure up to 2 GPa linearly increases the critical temperature\nand the resistivity residual ratio. A simple two-band model is used to describe\nthe transport and magnetic properties of Pr$_4$Fe$_2$As$_2$Te$_{1-x}$O$_4$. The\nmodel can successfully explain the strongly temperature dependent negative Hall\ncoefficient and the high magnetic anisotropy assuming that the mobility of\nelectrons is higher than that of holes.\n", "  Thermal shifts and fluctuations at finite temperature below the deconfinement\ncrossover from hadronic matter to the quark-gluon plasma provide a viable way\nto search for missing states with given quantum numbers in the hadronic\nspectrum. We analyze three realizations of the hadron resonance gas model in\nthe light quark (uds) sector: the states from the Particle Data Group tables\nwith or without width and from the Relativized Quark Model. We elaborate on the\nmeaning of hadronic completeness and thermodynamical equivalence on the light\nof lattice QCD trace anomaly, heavy quark entropy shift and baryon,charge and\nstrangeness susceptibilities.\n", "  Understanding the basic physics related to archetypal lithium battery\nmaterial (such as LiCo$_y$Mn$_{2-y}$O$_{4}$) is of considerable interest and is\nexpected to aid designing of cathodes of high capacity. The relation between\nelectrochemical performance, activated-transport parameters, thermal expansion,\nand cooperativity of electron-phonon-interaction distortions in\nLiCo$_y$Mn$_{2-y}$O$_{4}$ is investigated. The first order\ncooperative-normal-mode transition, detected through coefficient of thermal\nexpansion, is found to disappear at a critical doping ($y \\sim 0.16$);\ninterestingly, for $y \\gtrsim 0.16$ the resistivity does not change much with\ndoping and the electrochemical capacity becomes constant over repeated cycling.\nThe critical doping $y \\sim 0.16$ results in breakdown of the network of\ncooperative/coherent normal-mode distortions; this leads to vanishing of the\nfirst-order transition, establishment of hopping channels with lower\nresistance, and enhancing lithiation and delithiation of the battery, thereby\nminimizing electrochemical capacity fading.\n", "  We show that a single atomic magnetometer in a magnetically unshielded\nenvironment can be used to perform magnetic particle spectroscopy (MPS) and AC\nsusceptometry (ACS) on liquid-suspended magnetic nanoparticles. We demonstrate\nmethods allowing a simultaneous recording of M(H) and dM/dH(H) dependences of\nsamples containing down to 1 $\\mu$g of iron. Our results pave the way towards\nan atomic magnetometer based MPI scanner.\n", "  The increased particle flux at the high luminosity phase of the Large Hadron\nCollider (HL-LHC), with instantaneous luminosities of up to 7.5 times the\noriginal design value, will have an impact on many sub-systems of the ATLAS\ndetector. This contribution highlights the particular impacts on the ATLAS\nliquid argon calorimeter system, together with an overview of the various\nupgrade plans leading up to the HL-LHC. The higher luminosities are of\nparticular importance for the forward calorimeters (FCal), where the expected\nincrease in the ionization load poses a number of problems that can degrade the\nFCal performance such as beam heating and space-charge effects in the liquid\nargon gaps and high-voltage drop due to increased current drawn over the\ncurrent-limiting resistors. A proposed FCal replacement as a way to counter\nsome of these problems is weighed against the risks associated with the\nreplacement. To further mitigate the effects of increased pile-up, the\ninstallation of a high-granularity timing detector at the front face of each\nend-cap cryostat is also currently under consideration. Several different\nsensor technologies and layouts are being investigated.\n", "  How much information do large brain networks integrate as a whole over the\nsum of their parts? Can the dynamical complexity of such networks be globally\nquantified in an information-theoretic way and be meaningfully coupled to brain\nfunction? Recently, measures of dynamical complexity such as integrated\ninformation have been proposed. However, problems related to the normalization\nand Bell number of partitions associated to these measures make these\napproaches computationally infeasible for large-scale brain networks. Our goal\nin this work is to address this problem. Our formulation of network integrated\ninformation is based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the\nmultivariate distribution on the set of network states versus the corresponding\nfactorized distribution over its parts. We find that implementing the maximum\ninformation partition optimizes computations. These methods are well-suited for\nlarge networks with linear stochastic dynamics. We compute the integrated\ninformation for both, the system's attractor states, as well as non-stationary\ndynamical states of the network. We then apply this formalism to brain networks\nto compute the integrated information for the human brain's connectome.\nCompared to a randomly re-wired network, we find that the specific topology of\nthe brain generates greater information complexity.\n", "  We present a weighted estimator of the covariance and correlation in\nbipartite complex systems with a double layer of heterogeneity. The advantage\nprovided by the weighted estimators lies in the fact that the unweighted sample\ncovariance and correlation can be shown to possess a bias. Indeed, such a bias\naffects real bipartite systems, and, for example, we report its effects on two\nempirical systems, one social and the other biological. On the contrary, our\nnewly proposed weighted estimators remove the bias and are better suited to\ndescribe such systems.\n", "  Line optical tweezer and colloidal-probe atomic force microscopy can measure\nforce curves between two large colloidal particles of chemically the same\nsurfaces in a suspension of small colloidal particles. Recently, the authors\nproposed a transform theory to obtain the number density distribution of the\nsmall colloidal particles on the large colloidal particle from the force curve.\nIn this short letter, we propose another method which utilizes Ornstein-Zernike\nequation coupled with a closure equation instead of Kirkwood superposition\napproximation. The new transform theory uses a structure factor measured by\nx-ray or neutron scattering, and applies Nelder-Mead method to find the\nsolution. Since it is known that Ornstein-Zernike equation coupled with the\nclosure equation is accurate compared with Kirkwood superposition\napproximation, the new transform theory is theoretically better than the\nprevious methods when the structure factor and the closure equation are\nreliable.\n", "  We present a concept for using a polarization sensitive multispectral lidar\nto map the seasonal distribution and exchange of volatiles among the reservoirs\nof the Martian surface and atmosphere.\n  The LIDAR instrument will be a multi-wavelength, altitude-resolved, active\nnear-infrared (NIR, with 10 bands around 1.6 microns) instrument to measure the\nreflected intensity and polarization of backscattered radiation from planetary\nsurfaces and atmospheres. The proposed instrument would be ideally suited for a\nmission to Mars to comprehensively investigate the nature and seasonal\ndistributions of volatiles and aerosols. The investigation would include the\nabundance of atmospheric dust and condensed volatiles, surface and\ncloud/aerosol grain sizes and shapes, ice and dust particle microphysics and\nalso variations in atmospheric chemistry during multiple overflight local times\nthroughout polar night and day.\n  Such an instrument would be ideal for mapping and detection of recently\ndetected CO2 frost phenomena and H2O and CO2 precipitation events in the polar\nregions of Mars. Herein we discuss the applicability of this instrument to\ndetect and map sublimation/deposition 'mode flips' recently discovered by Brown\net al. (2016) using the CRISM passive infrared sensor on Mars Reconnaissance\nOrbiter.\n", "  The topologically nontrivial solution in Einstein-Dirac gravity with\ncosmological constant is obtained. The spacetime has the Hopf bundle as a\nspatial section. It is shown that the Hopf invariant is related to the spinor\ncurrent density. Two Dirac spinors are used for obtaining a diagonal\nenergy-momentum tensor. The solutions for the nongravitating Dirac equation on\nthe background of Lorentzian spacetime with the Hopf bundle as a spatial\nsection are also obtained. Nongravitating solutions of the Dirac equation are\ndefined by two quantum half-integer numbers $m, n$.\n", "  Many quantities are attributed a range of values that can apparently extend\nto infinity (on one side or both sides). In this respect, the definitions of\ntheir measurement units do not place any constraint to the maximum (or minimum)\nvalue for their validity. In general, that happens because those extreme values\nare far from being reached on the earth, or presently in experiments. However,\nsince the same units are used also in fields of physics, chemistry or\ntechnology where they could occur, namely in the description of the universe in\none sense, and in nano-scale or particle physics in another sense, the issue of\nextreme values (not in statistical meaning here) is not irrelevant. The\nquestion placed and discussed in this paper is whether the present kelvin\nscale, based on Lord Kelvin second definition (our currently accepted concept\nof temperature), applies over a full range between bounds (zero, infinite) or\nnot, and about the concept of temperature in itself in the extremes regions.\nThe aim, however, is not to provide an answer, but to suggest there are\ndifficulties with the application of current concepts at extremes of\ntemperature.\n", "  In this article we provide a new class of interior solutions of a five\ndimensional compact star in Einstein Gauss-Bonnet (EGB) gravity within the\nframework of Finch-skea space time. The Exterior space time is described by the\nEGB schwarzschild solution. To check physically validity of our model we\ninvestigate various physical properties like causality of solutions, Energy\nconditions, mass radius relations, TOV equations etc.\n", "  The description of FELWI in the collective approach, is given The dispersion\nequations are obtained and discussed for both Raman and Thompson regimes.\n", "  A mysterious type of matter is supposed to exist, because the observed\nrotational velocity curves of particle moving around the galactic center and\nthe expected rotational velocity curves do not match. There are also a number\nof proposals in the modified gravity for this discrepancy. In this contrast, in\n$2008$, B$\\ddot{\\text{o}}$hmer et al. presented an interesting idea in\n(Astropart Phys 29(6):386-392, 2008) where they showed that a $f(\\mathcal{R})$\ngravity model could actually explain dark matter to be a geometric effect only.\nThey solved the gravitational field equations in vacuum using generic\n$f(\\mathcal{R})$ gravity model for constant velocity regions and found that the\nresulting modifications in the Einstein-Hilbert Lagrangian is of the form\n$\\mathcal{R}^{1+m}$, where $m=V_{tg}^2/c^2$; $V_{tg}$ being the tangential\nvelocity of the test particle moving around galactic dark matter region and,\n$c$, the speed of light. From observations it is known that\n$m\\approx\\mathcal{O}(10^{-6})$. In this article, we perform two things (1) We\nshow that the form of $f(\\mathcal{R})$ they claimed is not correct. In doing\nthe calculations, we found that when the radial component of the metric for\nconstant velocity regions is a constant then the exact solutions for\n$f(\\mathcal{R})$ obtained is of the form of $\\mathcal{R}^{1-\\alpha}$ which\ncorresponds to a negative correction rather than positive, $\\alpha$ is a\nfunction of $m$. (2) We also show that we can not have an analytic solution of\n$f(\\mathcal{R})$ for all values of tangential velocity including the observed\nvalue of tangential velocity $200-300$Km/s if the radial coefficient of the\nmetric which describes the dark matter regions is \\emph{not a constant}. Thus,\nwe have to rely on the numerical solutions to get an approximate model for dark\nmatter in $f(\\mathcal{R})$ gravity.\n", "  Based on the U(4) strong interaction model, the behavior of the model at\nfinite temperature is investigated. It is shown that, under high temperature,\nthe dynamical breaking of gauge symmetry can be restored and the quark\nconfinement can be melted away.\n", "  Multivariate goodness-of-fit and two-sample tests are important components of\nmany nuclear and particle physics analyses. While a variety of powerful methods\nare available if the dimensionality of the feature space is small, such tests\nrapidly lose power as the dimensionality increases and the data inevitably\nbecome sparse. Machine learning classifiers are powerful tools capable of\nreducing highly multivariate problems into univariate ones, on which commonly\nused tests such as $\\chi^2$ or Kolmogorov-Smirnov may be applied. We explore\napplying both traditional and machine-learning-based tests to several example\nproblems, and study how the power of each approach depends on the\ndimensionality. A pedagogical discussion is provided on which types of problems\nare best suited to using traditional versus machine-learning-based tests, and\non the how to properly employ the machine-learning-based approach.\n", "  In this paper, variation in electrical properties of CFRP caused by\nrelatively low magnitude current impulses discharged through CFRP coupons are\nreported, and internal changes of the composite, due to current impulses, are\nstudied. Based on electrical resistance measurements caused by these currents,\nproperty changes in CFRP composite coupons of two different carbon ply\norientations are compared. Furthermore, it will be investigated if the changes\ncaused by current impulses are mainly focused in the region of the current\ninjection at the edges of composite coupons, or are they distributed uniformly\nthrough the bulk of the composite.\n", "  The first ionization potential of neutral atoms is determined from thresholds\nof laser-induced optical breakdown. Bulk material ablation plasma of aluminum,\nsilver, lead, indium and copper is created in laboratory air with focused, 5-ns\npulsed Nd:YAG, 1064 nm IR radiation. At fixed spot size of 2 $\\pm$ 0.1 mm, the\nlaser fluence is varied from 16 to 3 J/cm$^2$. The first ionization potentials\nof the lines Al I 396.2, Ag I 520.9, Pb I 405.8 and 406.2, In I 410.2 and Cu I\n515.3 nm are measured to amount to 5.9 $\\pm$ 0.2, 7.6 $\\pm$ 0.3, 7.4 $\\pm$ 0.2,\n5.8 $\\pm$ 0.1 and 7.7 $\\pm$ 0.2 eV, respectively.\n", "  In this paper we describe the echelle spectrograph of the 2 meter telescope\nof the Rozhen National Astronomical Observatory. The spectrograph is a\ncross-dispersed, bench-mounted, fiber-fed instrument giving a resolution from\n$\\sim$30000 to $\\sim$45000. The spectral range obtained in one single image is\nfrom 3900 to 9000 {\\AA}. We describe the parameters of the fiber injection and\nthe guiding unit, of the spectrograph itself, and of the detector. The\nidentified orders and the resulting resolving power are presented. The\nopportunity to increase of the resolution by using a narrower slit is discussed\nand the corresponding loss of flux is calculated. The expected signal-to-noise\nratio for a set of stars of different magnitudes was derived. Some of the first\nresults obtained with ESpeRo are shortly described.\n", "  We introduce a large class of Sobolev bi-orthogonal polynomial sequences\narising from a $LU$-factorizable moment matrix and associated with a suitable\nmeasure matrix that characterizes the Sobolev bilinear form. A theory of\ndeformations of Sobolev bilinear forms is also proposed. We consider both\npolynomial deformations and a class of transformations related to the action of\nlinear operators on the entries of a given bilinear form. Transformation\nformulae among new and old polynomial sequences are determined. Finally,\nintegrable hierarchies of evolution equations arising from the factorization of\na time deformation of the moment matrix are presented.\n", "  Integrated photonics offers great potential for quantum communication devices\nin terms of complexity, robustness and scalability. Silicon photonics in\nparticular is a leading platform for quantum photonic technologies, with\nfurther benefits of miniaturisation, cost-effective device manufacture and\ncompatibility with CMOS microelectronics. However, effective techniques for\nhigh-speed modulation of quantum states in standard silicon photonic platforms\nhave been limited. Here we overcome this limitation and demonstrate high-speed\nlow-error quantum key distribution modulation with silicon photonic devices\ncombining slow thermo-optic DC biases and fast (10~GHz bandwidth)\ncarrier-depletion modulation. The ability to scale up these integrated circuits\nand incorporate microelectronics opens the way to new and advanced integrated\nquantum communication technologies and larger adoption of quantum-secured\ncommunications.\n", "  As part of the PIP-II Injector Experiment (PXIE) accelerator, a four-vane\nradio frequency quadrupole (RFQ) accelerates a 30-keV, 1-mA to 10-mA H- ion\nbeam to 2.1 MeV. It is designed to operate at a frequency of 162.5 MHz with\narbitrary duty factor, including continuous wave (CW) mode. The resonant\nfrequency is controlled solely by a water-cooling system. We present an initial\nneural network model of the RFQ frequency response to changes in the cooling\nsystem and RF power conditions during pulsed operation. A neural network model\nwill be used in a model predictive control scheme to regulate the resonant\nfrequency of the RFQ.\n", "  When it isn't possible to tell two distinct experimental procedures apart\npurely from their input/output statistics, then it seems a plausible hypothesis\nthat the two procedures must be physically identical. We call such a hypothesis\n\"noncontextuality\", an instance of Leibniz's principle of the identity of\nindiscernibles. Read in the contrapositive, this hypothesis entails that any\nphysical distinctions between two experimental procedures must necessarily lead\nto a difference in their operational statistics. The results I present in this\nthesis concern the failure of this hypothesis -- a failure dubbed\n\"contextuality\" -- when one tries to embed an operational theory (such as\nquantum theory) in the ontological models framework. The Kochen-Specker theorem\ndemonstrates the failure of noncontextuality for deterministic ontological\nmodels of quantum theory, i.e., those ontological models where the\nontic/physical state of the system fixes the outcome of any projective\nmeasurement on the system in a deterministic manner. This thesis goes beyond\nthe Kochen-Specker (KS) theorem by asking what operational facts must be\nverified in experiments to conclude that Nature does not admit noncontextual\nontological models, not even indeterministic ones. This leads to\nnoncontextuality inequalities that are robust to noise in the preparations and\nmeasurements. In the particular case of quantum theory, these inequalities are\nmeaningful even when unsharp measurements (or POVMs) are allowed, a feature not\nshared by the traditional approach to KS-noncontextuality where unsharp\nmeasurements are excluded by fiat: allowing them renders even trivial POVMs\n(proportional to identity) maximally KS-contextual. The sense in which trivial\nPOVMs are indeed \"trivial\" (or \"noncontextual\") is clear in our approach: they\nare simply too noisy to lead to violation of our noncontextuality inequalities.\n", "  The utility of satisfiability (SAT) as an application focused hard\ncomputational problem is well established. We explore the potential of quantum\nannealing to enhance classical SAT solving, especially where sampling from the\nspace of all possible solutions is of interest. We address the formulation of\nSAT problems to make them suitable for commercial quantum annealers, practical\nconcerns in their implementation, and how the performance of the resulting\nquantum solver compares to and complements classical SAT solvers.\n", "  A lagrangian which describes interactions between a soliton and a background\nfield is derived for sigma models whose target is a symmetric space. The\nbackground field modifies the usual moduli space approximation to soliton\ndynamics in two ways: by introducing a potential energy, and by inducing a\nKaluza-Klein metric on the moduli space. In the particular case of the Skyrme\nmodel, this lagrangian is quantised and shown to agree with the leading\npion-nucleon term in the chiral effective lagrangian, which is widely used in\ntheoretical nuclear physics. Thus chiral perturbation theory could be\nconsidered a low energy limit of the Skyrme model.\n", "  Much attention has been drawn to the recent discoveries by the Advanced Laser\nInterferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) of merging intermediate\nmass black holes. Of particular interest is the possibility that the merger\nevents detected could be evidence of dark matter in the form of primordial\nblack holes (PBHs). It has been argued that the presence of many black holes\nwould effect the thermal and ionization history of the universe via their\naccretion of matter which would have strong signatures in the Cosmic Microwave\nBackground's (CMB) power spectra evident in the damping of anisotropies and\nchange in low-$l$ polarization power. In general the accretion is quite\nsensitive to the specific physics involved and the conditions of the early\nuniverse. In this work, we take a minimal approach and find constraints on PBHs\nnot including the model dependent effects of nonlinear structure of formation\nor transition between different accretion models which would work to increase\nthe effect. In addition, we include the relative velocity between dark matter\nand baryonic matter including the effects of supersonic streaming at high\nredshift which work to significantly reduce the constraining power. We also\nexamine the constraints on more astrophysically-motivated extended black hole\nmass functions and discuss how mergers might effect this distribution. We find\nconstraints on PBHs in the range $ \\approx 30 M_\\odot$, finding that they could\nnot compose more than $10\\%$ of the total dark matter content.\n", "  The Long Baseline Neutrino Facility (LBNF) project will build a beamline\nlocated at Fermilab to create and aim an intense neutrino beam of appropriate\nenergy range toward the DUNE detectors at the SURF facility in Lead, South\nDakota. Neutrino production starts in the Target Station, which consists of a\nsolid target, magnetic focusing horns, and the associated sub-systems and\nshielding infrastructure. Protons hit the target producing mesons which are\nthen focused by the horns into a helium-filled decay pipe where they decay into\nmuons and neutrinos. The target and horns are encased in actively cooled steel\nand concrete shielding in a chamber called the target chase. The reference\ndesign chase is filled with air, but nitrogen and helium are being evaluated as\nalternatives. A replaceable beam window separates the decay pipe from the\ntarget chase. The facility is designed for initial operation at 1.2 MW, with\nthe ability to upgrade to 2.4 MW, and is taking advantage of the experience\ngained by operating Fermilab's NuMI facility. We discuss here the design\nstatus, associated challenges, and ongoing R&D and physics-driven component\noptimization of the Target Station.\n", "  Many real-world complex networks exhibit a community structure, in which the\nmodules correspond to actual functional units. Identifying these communities is\na key challenge for scientists. A common approach is to search for the network\npartition that maximizes a quality function. Here, we present a detailed\nanalysis of a recently proposed function, namely modularity density. We show\nthat it does not incur in the drawbacks suffered by traditional modularity, and\nthat it can identify networks without ground-truth community structure,\nderiving its analytical dependence on link density in generic random graphs. In\naddition, we show that modularity density allows an easy comparison between\nnetworks of different sizes, and we also present some limitations that methods\nbased on modularity density may suffer from. Finally, we introduce an\nefficient, quadratic community detection algorithm based on modularity density\nmaximization, validating its accuracy against theoretical predictions and on a\nset of benchmark networks.\n", "  We report perturbed angular correlation measurements with 111mCd/111Cd and\n111In/111Cd probes, at the ISOLDE-CERN facility, in the manganite compounds\nBaMnO3 , with the 6H and 15R polymorphs, and SrMnO3 , with the 4H polymorph.\nThe electric field gradient (EFG) is measured, and found approximately constant\nin a large temperature range for all the compounds. The EFG is also calculated\nfrom first principles with density functional theory, and compared with\nexperimental results by considering diluted substitutional Cd impurities. Based\non the results, we assign as sites for the probes the Ba (for BaMnO3-6H, 15R)\nand Sr (for SrMnO3-4H) sites, apart from fractions of undetermined origin in\nthe case of BaMnO3-6H. We predict the hyperfine parameters in the recently\nsynthesized multiferroic manganite Sr0.5Ba0.5MnO3 , and its variation with the\nstructure and electric polarization, which is found to be very small.\n", "  The study of nuclear magnetic resonance and nuclear spin-lattice relaxation\nwas conducted in an asymmetrically doped to $n\\sim1.8\\times10^{11}$ cm$^{-2}$\n16 nm AlAs quantum well grown in the $[001]$-direction. Dynamic polarization of\nnuclear spins due to the hyperfine interaction resulted in the so-called\nOverhauser shift of the two-dimensional conduction electron spin resonance. The\nmaximum shifts achieved in the experiments are several orders of magnitude\nsmaller than in GaAs-based heterostructures indicating that hyperfine\ninteraction is weak. The nuclear spin-lattice relaxation time extracted from\nthe decay of Overhauser shift over time turned out to depend on the filling\nfactor of the two-dimensional electron system. This observation indicates that\nnuclear spin-lattice relaxation is mostly due to the interaction between\nelectron and nuclear spins. Overhauser shift diminishes resonantly when the\nRF-radiation of certain frequencies was applied to the sample. This effect\nserved as an indirect, yet powerful method for nuclear magnetic resonance\ndetection: NMR quadrupole splitting of $^{75}$As nuclei was clearly resolved.\nTheoretical calculations performed describe well these experimental findings.\n", "  A white dwarf (WD) captured into a high-eccentricity orbit around a massive\nblack hole (MBH) may undergo many pericenter passages before tidal disruption.\nDuring these passages, the tidal potential of the MBH excites internal\noscillations or waves in the WD, and the dissipation of these oscillations can\nsignificantly influence the physical properties of the WD prior to its\ndisruption. We calculate the amplitude of the tidally excited gravity\n(buoyancy) waves in the WD as a function of the pericenter distance and\neccentricity for realistic WD models, under the assumption that these outgoing\ngravity waves are efficiently dissipated in outer layers of the WD by\nnon-linear effects or radiative damping. We obtain fitting formulae for the\ntidal energy and angular momentum transfer rates as well as the tidal heating\nrate. We find that these dynamical tides are much weaker than gravitational\nradiation in driving the orbital decay of the WD-MBH binary, and they are also\ninefficient in changing the WD spin during the orbital evolution. Incorporating\nour computed tidal dissipation rate into a MESA-based WD evolution code, we\nfind that tidal heating can lead to appreciable brightening of the WD and may\ninduce runaway fusion in the hydrogen envelope well before the WD undergoes\ntidal disruption.\n", "  The simplest purely imaginary and piecewise constant $\\cal PT$-symmetric\npotential located inside a larger box is studied. Unless its strength exceeds a\ncertain critical value, all the spectrum of its bound states remains real and\ndiscrete. We interpret such a model as an initial element of the generalized\nnon-Hermitian Witten's hierarchy of solvable Hamiltonians and construct its\nfirst supersymmetric (SUSY) partner in closed form.\n"]}
