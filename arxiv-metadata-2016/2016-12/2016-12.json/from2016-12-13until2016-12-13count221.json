Collaboration.\nThe AHCAL prototype consists of a 38-layer sandwich structure of steel plates\nand highly-segmented scintillator tiles that are read out by\nwavelength-shifting fibers coupled to SiPMs. The signal is amplified and shaped\nwith a custom-designed ASIC. A calibration/monitoring system based on LED light\nwas developed to monitor the SiPM gain and to measure the full SiPM response\ncurve in order to correct for non-linearity. Ultimately, the physics goals are\nthe study of hadron shower shapes and testing the concept of particle flow. The\ntechnical goal consists of measuring the performance and reliability of 7608\nSiPMs. The AHCAL was commissioned in test beams at DESY and CERN. The entire\nprototype was completed in 2007 and recorded hadron showers, electron showers\nand muons at different energies and incident angles in test beams at CERN and\nFermilab.\n", "  We are going to show that new star product was found by Mebaraki for\nnoncommutative curved space time has some properties when $\\triangle$ (it has\nappeared in new multiplication) is a constant.\n", "  A new method for calibrating the hadron response of a segmented calorimeter\nis developed and successfully applied to beam test data. It is based on a\nprincipal component analysis of energy deposits in the calorimeter layers,\nexploiting longitudinal shower development information to improve the measured\nenergy resolution. Corrections for invisible hadronic energy and energy lost in\ndead material in front of and between the calorimeters of the ATLAS experiment\nwere calculated with simulated Geant4 Monte Carlo events and used to\nreconstruct the energy of pions impinging on the calorimeters during the 2004\nBarrel Combined Beam Test at the CERN H8 area. For pion beams with energies\nbetween 20 GeV and 180 GeV, the particle energy is reconstructed within 3% and\nthe energy resolution is improved by between 11% and 25% compared to the\nresolution at the electromagnetic scale.\n", "  For a system of current interest (composed of charm, anticharm quarks and a\npair of light ones), we show trends in phenomenological implications of\nQCD-based improvements to a simple quark model treatment. We employ resonating\ngroup method to render this difficult four-body problem manageable. We use a\nquadratic confinement so as to be able to improve beyond the Born\napproximation. We report the position of the pole corresponding to\n$\\bar{D}^{0}D^{0*}$ molecule for the best fit of a model parameter to the\nrelevant QCD simulations. We point out the interesting possibility that the\npole can be shifted to $3872$ MeV by introducing another parameter $I_{0}$ that\nchanges the strength of the interaction in this one component of $X(3872)$. The\nrevised value of this second parameter can guide future trends in modeling of\nthe full exotic meson $X(3872)$. We also report the changes with $I_{0}$ in the\n$S$-wave spin averaged cross sections for\n$\\bar{D}^{0}D^{0*}\\longrightarrow\\omega J/\\psi$ and\n$\\bar{D}^{0}D^{0*}\\longrightarrow\\rho J/\\psi$. These cross sections are\nimportant regarding the study of QGP (quark gluon plasma).\n", "  We study the statistical properties of spatially averaged global injected\npower fluctuations for Taylor-Couette flow of a worm-like micellar gel formed\nby surfactant CTAT. At sufficiently high Weissenberg numbers (Wi) the shear\nrate and hence the injected power p(t) at a constant applied stress shows large\nirregular fluctuations in time. The nature of the probability distribution\nfunction (pdf) of p(t) and the power-law decay of its power spectrum are very\nsimilar to that observed in recent studies of elastic turbulence for polymer\nsolutions. Remarkably, these non-Gaussian pdfs can be well described by an\nuniversal large deviation functional form given by the Generalized Gumbel (GG)\ndistribution observed in the context of spatially averaged global measures in\ndiverse classes of highly correlated systems. We show by in-situ rheology and\npolarized light scattering experiments that in the elastic turbulent regime the\nflow is spatially smooth but random in time, in agreement with a recent\nhypothesis for elastic turbulence.\n", "  We investigate a three component fermion mixture in the presence of weak\nattractive interactions. We use a combination of the equation of motion and the\nGaussian variational mean-field approaches, which both allow for simultaneous\nsuperfluid and magnetic ordering in an unbiased way, and capture the interplay\nbetween the two order parameters. This interplay significantly modifies the\nphase diagram, especially the superfluid-normal phase boundaries. In the close\nvicinity of the critical temperature and for small chemical potential\nimbalances, strong particle-hole symmetry breaking leads to a phase diagram\nsimilar to the one predicted by Cherng et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 99, 130406\n(2007)], however, the overall phase diagram is markedly different: new chemical\npotential-driven first and second order transitions and triple points emerge as\nwell as more exotic second order multicritical points, and bicritical lines\nwith O(2,2) symmetry. We identify the terms which are necessary to capture this\ncomplex phase diagram in a Ginzburg-Landau approach, and determine the\ncorresponding coefficients.\n", "  The experimental observation that vanadate superlattices\n(LaVO$_3$)$_m$/SrVO$_3$ show ferromagnetism up to room temperature [U.\\\nL\\\"uders {\\it et al.}, Phys.\\ Rev.\\ B {\\bf 80}, 241102R (2009)] is investigated\nby means of density functional theory. First, the influence of the density\nfunctional on the electronic and magnetic structure of bulk ${\\rm LaVO_3}$ is\ndiscussed. Second, the band structure of a (LaVO$_3$)$_m$/SrVO$_3$ slab for\n$m=5$ and 6 is calculated. Very different behaviors for odd and even values of\n$m$ are found: In the odd case lattice relaxation results into a buckling of\nthe interface VO$_2$ layers that leads to spin-polarized interfaces. In the\neven case a decoupling of the interface VO$_2$ layers from the LaO layers is\nobtained, confining the interface electrons into a two-dimensional electron\ngas. The orbital reconstruction at the interface due to the lattice relaxation\nis discussed.\n", "  An accelerator-driven subcritical reactor functions well in incinerating\nhigh-level radiotoxic waste (HLW) as well as providing energy. China is on his\nway to establish such a facility to transmutate the annual 1000 tons of HLW. A\nneutronic analysis has been performed for a reference core with a special task\nof burning minor actinides 237Np, 241Am, 243Am and 244Cm. Instant operation\nparameters are determined, including neutron energy spectra, thermal power\ndistribution and transmutation validation. Burning-up analysis is carried out\nto further confirm the incineration efficiency. The core parameters optimized\nin this work will be applied to simulate in-core fuel behavior in future\nresearch.\n", "  Microfluidics integrated with sol-gel processes is introduced in preparing\nmonodispersed MOX nuclear fuel microspheres using nonactive cerium as a\nsurrogate for uranium or plutonium. The detailed information about microfluidic\ndevices and sol-gel processes are provided. The effects of viscosity and flow\nrate of continuous and dispersed phase on size and size distribution of CeO2\nmicrospheres have been investigated. A comprehensive characterization of the\nCeO2 microspheres has been conducted, including XRD pattern, SEM, density, size\nand size distribution. The size of prepared monodisperse particles can be\ncontrolled precisely in range of 10{\\mu}m to 1000{\\mu}m and the particle CV is\nbelow 3%.\n", "  The partition function of composite bosons (\"cobosons\" for short) is\ncalculated in the canonical ensemble, with the Pauli exclusion principle\nbetween their fermionic components included in an exact way through the finite\ntemperature many-body formalism for composite quantum particles we recently\ndeveloped. To physically understand the very compact result we obtain, we first\npresent a diagrammatic approach to the partition function of $N$ elementary\nbosons. We then show how to extend this approach to cobosons with Pauli\nblocking and interaction between their fermions. These diagrams provide deep\ninsights on the structure of a coboson condensate, paving the way toward the\ndetermination of the critical parameters for their quantum condensation.\n", "  We introduce a model of dyadic social interactions and establish its\ncorrespondence with relational models theory (RMT), a theory of human social\nrelationships. RMT posits four elementary models of relationships governing\nhuman interactions, singly or in combination: Communal Sharing, Authority\nRanking, Equality Matching, and Market Pricing. To these are added the limiting\ncases of asocial and null interactions, whereby people do not coordinate with\nreference to any shared principle. Our model is rooted in the observation that\neach individual in a dyadic interaction can do either the same thing as the\nother individual, a different thing or nothing at all. To represent these three\npossibilities, we consider two individuals that can each act in one out of\nthree ways toward the other: perform a social action X or Y, or alternatively\ndo nothing. We demonstrate that the relationships generated by this model\naggregate into six exhaustive and disjoint categories. We propose that four of\nthese categories match the four relational models, while the remaining two\ncorrespond to the asocial and null interactions defined in RMT. We generalize\nour results to the presence of N social actions. We infer that the four\nrelational models form an exhaustive set of all possible dyadic relationships\nbased on social coordination. Hence, we contribute to RMT by offering an answer\nto the question of why there could exist just four relational models. In\naddition, we discuss how to use our representation to analyze data sets of\ndyadic social interactions, and how social actions may be valued and matched by\nthe agents.\n", "  Experimental results of E2 transition probabilities or B(E2) values for the\nknown first 2$^{+}$ states in 447 even-even nuclei have been compiled and\nevaluated. The evaluation policies for the analysis of experimental data have\nbeen described and new results are discussed. The recommended B(E2) values have\nbeen compared with comprehensive shell model calculations for a selected set of\nnuclei, where such theoretical procedures are amenable. The present work was\nmotivated by a rapid increase in the number of new B(E2) measurements for the\nfirst 2$^{+}$ states since the previous evaluation of such data by S. Raman\n{\\it et al.} published in 2001. Future plans to investigate the systematics of\nB(E2)$\\uparrow$ values, and intercomparison of different experimental\ntechniques to obtain these data are outlined.\n", "  In the present paper we continue the project of systematic construction of\ninvariant differential operators on the example of the non-compact algebras\n$su(n,n)$. Earlier were given the main multiplets of indecomposable elementary\nrepresentations for $n\\leq 4$, and the reduced ones for $n=2$. Here we give all\nreduced multiplets containing physically relevant representations including the\nminimal ones for the algebra $su(3,3)$. Due to the recently established\nparabolic relations the results are valid also for the algebra\n$sl(6,\\mathbb{R})$ with suitably chosen maximal parabolic subalgebra.\n", "  We study theoretically the interaction between two species of ultracold atoms\nconfined into two layers of a finite separation, and demonstrate the existence\nof new types of confinement-induced interlayer bound and quasi-bound molecules:\nthese novel exciton-like interlayer molecules appear for both positive and\nnegative scattering lengths, and exist even for layer separations many times\nlarger than the interspecies scattering length. The lifetime of the quasi-bound\nmolecules grows exponentially with increasing layer separation, and they can\ntherefore be observed in simple shaking experiments, as we demonstrate through\ndetailed many-body calculations. These quasi-bound molecules can also give rise\nto novel interspecies Feshbach resonances, enabling one to control\ngeometrically the interaction between the two species by changing the layer\nseparation. Rather counter-intuitively, the species can be made strongly\ninteracting, by increasing their spatial separation. The separation induced\ninterlayer resonances provide a powerful tool for the experimental control of\ninterspecies interactions and enables one to realize novel quantum phases of\nmulticomponent quantum gases.\n", "  In the present paper we continue the project of systematic construction of\ninvariant differential operators on the example of the non-compact algebras\n$su(n,n)$. Earlier were given the main multiplets of indecomposable elementary\nrepresentations for $n\\leq 4$, and the reduced ones for $n=2,3$. Here we give\nall reduced multiplets containing physically relevant representations including\nthe minimal ones for $n=4$. Due to the recently established parabolic relations\nthe results are valid also for the algebras $sl(8,\\mathbb{R})$ and $su^*(8)$\nwith suitably chosen maximal parabolic subalgebras.\n", "  A new model is formulated of the sociological effect of the spiral of\nsilence, introduced by Elisabeth Noelle-Neumann in 1974. The probability that a\nnew opinion is openly expressed decreases with the difference between this new\nopinion and the perceived opinion of the majority. We also assume that the\nsystem is open, i.e. some people enter and some leave during the process of the\nopinion formation. An influence of a leader is simulated by a comparison of two\nruns of the simulation, where the leader has different opinion in each run. The\ndifference of the mean expressed opinions in these two runs persists long after\nthe leader's leave.\n", "  For a noncommutative configuration space whose coordinate algebra is the\nuniversal enveloping algebra of a finite dimensional Lie algebra, it is known\nhow to introduce an extension playing the role of the corresponding\nnoncommutative phase space, namely by adding the commuting deformed derivatives\nin a consistent and nontrivial way, therefore obtaining certain deformed\nHeisenberg algebra. This algebra has been studied in physical contexts, mainly\nin the case of the kappa-Minkowski space-time. Here we equip the entire phase\nspace algebra with a coproduct, so that it becomes an instance of a completed\nvariant of a Hopf algebroid over a noncommutative base, where the base is the\nenveloping algebra.\n", "  Existence and stability of Dirac points in the dispersion relation of\noperators periodic with respect to the hexagonal lattice is investigated for\ndifferent sets of additional symmetries. The following symmetries are\nconsidered: rotation by $2\\pi/3$ and inversion, rotation by $2\\pi/3$ and\nhorizontal reflection, inversion or reflection with weakly broken rotation\nsymmetry, and the case where no Dirac points arise: rotation by $2\\pi/3$ and\nvertical reflection.\n  All proofs are based on symmetry considerations. In particular, existence of\ndegeneracies in the spectrum is deduced from the (co)representation of the\nrelevant symmetry group. The conical shape of the dispersion relation is\nobtained from its invariance under rotation by $2\\pi/3$. Persistence of conical\npoints when the rotation symmetry is weakly broken is proved using a geometric\nphase in one case and parity of the eigenfunctions in the other.\n", "  We suggest a generalization of the Feynman path integral to an integral over\nrandom surfaces. The proposed action is proportional to the linear size of the\nrandom surfaces and is called gonihedric. The convergence and the properties of\nthe partition function are analysed. The model can also be formulated as a spin\nsystem with identical partition function. The spin system represents a\ngeneralisation of the Ising model with ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic and\nquartic interactions. Higher symmetry of the model allows to construct dual\nspin systems in three and four dimensions. In three dimensions the transfer\nmatrix describes the propagation of closed loops and we found its exact\nspectrum. It is a unique exact solution of the tree-dimensional statistical\nspin system. In three and four dimensions the system exhibits the second order\nphase transitions. The gonihedric spin systems have exponentially degenerated\nvacuum states separated by the potential barriers and can be used as a storage\nof binary information.\n", "  The Starobinsky model of inflation, consistent with Planck 2015, has a\npeculiar form of the action, which contains the leading Einstein term $R$, the\n$R^2$ term with a huge coefficient, and negligible higher-order terms. We\npropose an explanation of this form based on compactification of extra\ndimensions. Once tuning of order $10^{-4}$ is accepted to suppress the linear\nterm $R$, we no longer have to suppress higher-oder terms, which give\nnontrivial corrections to the Starobinsky model. We show our predictions of the\nspectral index, its runnings, and the tensor-to-scalar ratio. Finally, we\ndiscuss a possibility that quantum gravity may appear at the scale $\\Lambda\n\\gtrsim 5 \\times 10^{15}$ GeV.\n", "  Yield Optimized Interpolated Superoscillations (YOIS) have been recently\nintroduced as a means for possibly making the use of the phenomenon of\nsuperoscillation practical. In this paper we study how good is a\nsuperoscillation that is not optimal. Namely, by how much is the yield\ndecreased when the signal departs from the optimal one. We consider two\nsituations. One is the case where the signal strictly obeys the interpolation\nrequirement and the other is when that requirement is relaxed. In the latter\ncase the yield can be increased at the expense of deterioration of signal\nquality. An important conclusion is that optimizing superoscillations may be\nchallenging in terms of the precision needed, however, storing and using them\nis not at all that sensitive. This is of great importance in any physical\nsystem where noise and error are inevitable.\n", "  We propose a compact perturbative approach that reveals the physical origin\nof the singularity occurring in the density dependence of correlation energy:\nlike fermions, elementary bosons have a singular correlation energy which comes\nfrom the accumulation, through Feynman \"bubble\" diagrams, of the same non-zero\nmomentum transfer excitations from the free particle ground state, that is, the\nFermi sea for fermions and the Bose-Einstein condensate for bosons. This\nunderstanding paves the way toward deriving the correlation energy of composite\nbosons like atomic dimers and semiconductor excitons, by suggesting Shiva\ndiagrams that have similarity with Feynman \"bubble\" diagrams, the previous\nelementary boson approaches, which hide this physics, being difficult to do so.\n", "  We analyze within quasi-particle theory a recent resonant inelastic x-ray\nscattering (RIXS) experiment on $\\mathrm{YBa_2Cu_3O_{6+x}}$ with the incoming\nphoton energy detuned at several values from the resonance maximum [Minola et\nal., Phys. Rev. Lett. 114, 217003 (2015)]. Surprisingly, the data shows much\nweaker dependence on detuning than expected from recent measurements on a\ndifferent cuprate superconductor, $\\mathrm{Bi_2Sr_2CuO_{6+x}}$ [Guarise et al.,\nNat. Commun. 5, 5760 (2014)]. We demonstrate here, that this discrepancy,\noriginally attributed to collective magnetic excitations, can be understood in\nterms of the differences between the band structures of these materials. We\nfind good agreement between theory and experiment over a large range of\ndopings, both in the underdoped and in the overdoped regime. Moreover, we\ndemonstrate that the RIXS signal depends sensitively on excitations at energies\nwell above the Fermi surface, that are inaccessible to traditionally used band\nstructure probes, such as angle-resolved photemisson spectroscopy. This makes\nRIXS a powerful probe of band structure, not suffering from surface preparation\nproblems and small sample sizes, making it potentially applicable to a number\nof cuprate materials.\n", "  Many methods have been proposed for community detection in networks, but most\nof them do not take into account additional information on the nodes that is\noften available in practice. In this paper, we propose a new joint community\ndetection criterion that uses both the network edge information and the node\nfeatures to detect community structures. One advantage our method has over\nexisting joint detection approaches is the flexibility of learning the impact\nof different features which may differ across communities. Another advantage is\nthe flexibility of choosing the amount of influence the feature information has\non communities. The method is asymptotically consistent under the block model\nwith additional assumptions on the feature distributions, and performs well on\nsimulated and real networks.\n", "  We study the Schur index of 4-dimensional $\\mathcal{N}=2$ circular quiver\ntheories. We show that the index can be expressed as a weighted sum over\npartition functions describing systems of free Fermions living on a circle. For\ncircular $SU(N)$ quivers of arbitrary length we evaluate the large $N$ limit of\nthe index, up to exponentially suppressed corrections. For the single node\ntheory ($\\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM) and the two node quiver we are able to go beyond\nthe large $N$ limit, and obtain the complete, all orders large $N$ expansion of\nthe index, as well as explicit finite $N$ results in terms of elliptic\nfunctions.\n", "  Three state-space based methods were tested in relation to the ability to\ndetect unidirectional coupling and synchronization of interconnected dynamical\nsystems. The first method, based on measure named M, was introduced by\nAndrzejak et al. in 2003 [1]. The second one, based on measure L, was described\nin 2009 by Chicharro et al. [5]. The third method, called convergent\ncross-mapping, came from Sugihara et al., 2012 [28]. The methods were compared\non 9 test examples of uni-directionally connected chaotic systems of H\\'enon,\nR\\\"ossler and Lorenz type. The tested systems were selected from previously\npublished causality studies. Matlab code for the three methods is provided. The\nresults show that each of the three examined state-space methods managed to\nreveal the presence and the direction of couplings and also to detect the onset\nof full synchronization.\n", "  Attractive non-local interactions jointly with repulsive local interaction in\na microscopic modelling of electronic Fermi liquids generate a competition\nbetween an enhancement of the static charge susceptibility---ultimately\nsignalling charge instability and phase separation---and its correlation\ninduced suppression. We analyse this scenario through the investigation of the\nextended Hubbard model on a two-dimensional square lattice, using the spin\nrotation invariant slave-boson representation of Kotliar and Ruckenstein. The\nquasiparticle density of states, the renormalised effective mass and the Landau\nparameter $F_0^s$ are presented, whereby the positivity of $F_0^s-1$\nconstitutes a criterion for stability. Van Hove singularities in the density of\nstates support possible charge instabilities. A (negative) next-nearest\nneighbour hopping parameter $t'$ shifts their positions and produces a tendency\ntowards charge instability even for low filling whereas the $t'$-controlled\nparticle-hole asymmetry of the correlation driven effective mass is small. A\nregion of instability on account of the attractive interaction $V$ is\nidentified, either at half filling in the absence of strong electronic\ncorrelations or, in the case of large on-site interaction $U$, at densities far\nfrom half filling.\n", "  Three-dimensional quantum electrodynamics with $N$ charged fermions contains\nmonopole operators that have been studied perturbatively at large $N$. Here, we\ninitiate the study of these monopole operators in the $4-\\epsilon$ expansion by\ngeneralizing them to codimension-3 defect operators in $d = 4-\\epsilon$\nspacetime dimensions. Assuming the infrared dynamics is described by an\ninteracting CFT, we define the \"conformal weight\" of these operators in terms\nof the free energy density on $S^2 \\times \\mathbb{H}^{2-\\epsilon}$ in the\npresence of magnetic flux through the $S^2$, and calculate this quantity to\nnext-to-leading order in $\\epsilon$. Extrapolating the conformal weight to\n$\\epsilon = 1$ gives an estimate of the scaling dimension of the monopole\noperators in $d=3$ that does not rely on the $1/N$ expansion. We also perform\nthe computation of the conformal weight in the large $N$ expansion for any $d$\nand find agreement between the large $N$ and the small $\\epsilon$ expansions in\ntheir overlapping regime of validity.\n", "  We present a well-balanced nodal discontinuous Galerkin (DG) scheme for\ncompressible Euler equations with gravity. The DG scheme makes use of\ndiscontinuous Lagrange basis functions supported at Gauss-Lobatto-Legendre\n(GLL) nodes together with GLL quadrature using the same nodes. The\nwell-balanced property is achieved by a specific form of source term\ndiscretization that depends on the nature of the hydrostatic solution, together\nwith the GLL nodes for quadrature of the source term. The scheme is able to\npreserve isothermal and polytropic stationary solutions upto machine precision\non any mesh composed of quadrilateral cells and for any gravitational\npotential. It is applied on several examples to demonstrate its well-balanced\nproperty and the improved resolution of small perturbations around the\nstationary solution.\n", "  We give a complete, self-contained, and mathematically rigorous proof that\nEuclidean Yang-Mills theories are perturbatively renormalisable, in the sense\nthat all correlation functions of arbitrary composite local operators fulfil\nsuitable Ward identities. Our proof treats rigorously both all ultraviolet and\ninfrared problems of the theory and provides, in the end, detailed analytical\nbounds on the correlation functions of an arbitrary number of composite local\noperators. These bounds are formulated in terms of certain weighted spanning\ntrees extending between the insertion points of these operators. Our proofs are\nobtained within the framework of the Wilson-Wegner-Polchinski-Wetterich\nrenormalisation group flow equations, combined with estimation techniques based\non tree structures. Compared with previous mathematical treatments of massless\ntheories without local gauge invariance [R. Guida and Ch. Kopper,\narXiv:1103.5692; J. Holland, S. Hollands, and Ch. Kopper, Commun. Math. Phys.\n342 (2016) 385] our constructions require several technical advances; in\nparticular, we need to fully control the BRST invariance of our correlation\nfunctions.\n", "  Two-particle angular correlations are studied in proton-lead collisions at a\nnucleon-nucleon centre-of-mass energy of $\\sqrt{s_{\\text{NN}}}=5$TeV, collected\nwith the LHCb detector at the LHC. The analysis is based on data recorded in\ntwo beam configurations, in which either the direction of the proton or that of\nthe lead ion is analysed. The correlations are measured in the laboratory\nsystem as a function of relative pseudorapidity, $\\Delta\\eta$, and relative\nazimuthal angle, $\\Delta\\phi$, for events in different classes of event\nactivity and for different bins of particle transverse momentum. In\nhigh-activity events a long-range correlation on the near side, $\\Delta\\phi\n\\approx 0$, is observed in the pseudorapidity range $2.0<\\eta<4.9$. This\nmeasurement of long-range correlations on the near side in proton-lead\ncollisions extends previous observations into the forward region up to\n$\\eta=4.9$. The correlation increases with growing event activity and is found\nto be more pronounced in the direction of the lead beam. However, the\ncorrelation in the direction of the lead and proton beams are found to be\ncompatible when comparing events with similar absolute activity in the\ndirection analysed.\n", "  When the Euler equations for shallow water are taken to the next order,\nbeyond KdV, momentum and energy are no longer exact invariants. (The only one\nis mass.) However, adiabatic invariants (AI) can be found. When the KdV\nexpansion parameters are zero, exact invariants are recovered. Existence of\nadiabatic invariants results from general theory of near-identity\ntransformations (NIT) which allow us to transform higher order nonintegrable\nequations to asymptotically equivalent (when small parameters tend to zero)\nintegrable form. Here we present the direct method of calculations of adiabatic\ninvariants. It does not need a transformation to a moving reference frame nor\nperforming a near-identity transformation. Numerical tests show that deviations\nof AI from almost constant values are indeed small.\n", "  We consider pure fermionic states with a varying number of quasiparticles and\nanalyze two types of reduced density operators: one is obtained via tracing out\nmodes, the other is obtained via tracing out particles. We demonstrate that\nspectra of mode-reduced states are not identical in general and fully\ncharacterize pure states with equispectral mode-reduced states. Such states are\nrelated via local unitary operations with states satisfying the parity\nsuperselection rule. Thus, valid purifications for fermionic density operators\nare found. To get particle-reduced operators for a general system, we introduce\nthe operation $\\Phi(\\varrho) = \\sum_i a_i \\varrho a_i^{\\dag}$. We conjecture\nthat spectra of $\\Phi^p(\\varrho)$ and conventional $p$-particle reduced density\nmatrix $\\varrho_p$ coincide. Nontrivial generalized Pauli constraints are\nderived for states satisfying the parity superselection rule.\n", "  We present an equivalence theorem to unify the two classes of uncertainty\nrelations, i.e., the variance-based ones and the entropic forms, which shows\nthat the entropy of an operator in a quantum system can be built from the\nvariances of a set of commutative operators. That means an uncertainty relation\nin the language of entropy may be mapped onto a variance-based one, and vice\nversa. Employing the equivalence theorem, alternative formulations of entropic\nuncertainty relations stronger than existing ones in the literature are\nobtained for qubit system, and variance based uncertainty relations for spin\nsystems are reached from the corresponding entropic uncertainty relations.\n", "  We propose an architecture for an analog quantum simulator of\nelectromagnetism in 2+1 dimensions, based on an array of superconducting\nfluxonium devices. The encoding is in the integer (spin-1 representation of the\nquantum link model formulation of compact U(1) lattice gauge theory. We show\nhow to engineer Gauss' law via an ancilla mediated gadget construction, and how\nto tune between the strongly coupled and intermediately coupled regimes. The\nwitnesses to the existence of the predicted confining phase of the model are\nprovided by nonlocal order parameters from Wilson loops and disorder parameters\nfrom 't Hooft strings. We show how to construct such operators in this model\nand how to measure them nondestructively via dispersive coupling of the\nfluxonium islands to a microwave cavity mode. Numerical evidence is found for\nthe existence of the confined phase in the ground state of the simulation\nHamiltonian on a ladder geometry.\n", "  Since its introduction by Hastings in [10], the technique of quasi-adiabatic\ncontinuation has become a central tool in the discussion and classification of\nground state phases. It connects the ground states of self-adjoint Hamiltonians\nin the same phase by a unitary quasi-local transformation. This paper takes a\nstep towards extending this result to non- self adjoint perturbations, though,\nfor technical reason, we restrict ourselves here to weak perturbations of\nnon-interacting spins. The extension to non-self adjoint perturbation is\nimportant for potential applications to Glauber dynamics (and its quantum\nanalogues). In contrast to the standard quasi-adiabatic transformation, the\ntransformation constructed here is exponentially local. Our scheme is inspired\nby KAM theory, with frustration-free operators playing the role of integrable\nHamiltonians.\n", "  We investigate gravitational radiation in dynamical noncommutative spaces. By\nincluding corrections to the gravitational potential due to dynamical\nnoncommutativity, we calculate the power in gravitational radiation and use\nobservational data to place an upper bound on the noncommutativity parameter.\nWe also study quantum interference induced by gravitational potential in the\nusual and dynamical noncommutative spaces, and compare the resulting phase\ndifference in these cases with that in commutative space.\n", "  We propose a toy model of Dark Energy in which the degrees of freedom\ncurrently dominating the energy density of the universe are described by a\npseudo-scalar \"axion field\" linearly coupled to the Pontryagin density, $\n\\text{tr}(F \\wedge F)$, i.e., the exterior derivative of the Chern-Simons form,\nof a gauge field. We assume that the axion has self-interactions corresponding\nto an exponential potential. We argue that a non-vanishing magnetic helicity of\nthe gauge field leads to slow-rolling of the axion at field values far below\nthe Planck scale. Our proposal suggests a \"Tracking Dark Energy Scenario\" in\nwhich the contribution of the axion energy density to the total energy density\nis constant (and small), during the early radiation phase, until a secular\ngrowth term proportional to the Pontryagin density of the gauge field becomes\ndominant. The initially small contribution of the axion field to the total\nenergy density is related to the observed small baryon-to-entropy ratio.\n", "  We propose a novel high-efficiency no-moving-parts Laguerre-Gauss (LG)\nspectrometer using two variable focus lenses and a variable sized pinhole that\novercomes the limitations of the classical, projective, phase flattening\ntechnique for measuring the Laguerre-Gauss (LG) spectrum of light beams.\nSimulation results show that the coupling losses are virtually zero and the\nonly losses are ring losses which are mode-dependent but beam\nwaist-independent. Hence, the detection efficiency for all modes is\nsimultaneously the maximum possible irrespective of the beam waist of the LG\nmodes chosen for the decomposition. The losses can also be easily\npre-calibrated to remove the efficiency bias amongst different modes.\n", "  In this paper, we study Grover walks on a line with one and two absorbing\nboundaries. In particular, we present some results for the absorbing\nprobabilities both in a semi-finite and finite line. Analytical expressions for\nthese absorbing probabilities are presented by using the combinatorial\napproach. These results are perfectly matched with numerical simulations. We\nshow that the behavior of Grover walks on a line with absorbing boundaries is\nstrikingly different from that of classical walks and that of Hadamard walks.\n", "  Three manifold topology is used to analyze the effect of anyonic\ninterferometers in which the probe anyons' path along an arm crosses itself,\nleading to a \"twisted\" or braided space-time trajectory for the probe anyons.\nIn the case of Ising non-Abelian anyons, twisted interferometry is shown to be\nable to generate a topologically protected $\\pi/8$-phase gate, which cannot be\ngenerated from quasiparticle braiding.\n", "  We report the first results of elliptic ($v_2$), triangular ($v_3$) and\nquadrangular flow ($v_4$) of charged particles in Pb-Pb collisions at\n$\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}=5.02$ TeV with the ALICE detector at the CERN Large Hadron\nCollider. The measurements are performed in the central pseudorapidity region\n$|\\eta|<0.8$ and for the transverse momentum range $0.2<p_{\\rm T}<5$ GeV/$c$.\nThe anisotropic flow is measured using two-particle correlations with a\npseudorapidity gap greater than one unit and with the multi-particle cumulant\nmethod. Compared to results from Pb-Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}=2.76$\nTeV, the anisotropic flow coefficients $v_{2}$, $v_{3}$ and $v_{4}$ are found\nto increase by ($3.0\\pm0.6$)%, ($4.3\\pm1.4$)% and ($10.2\\pm3.8$)%,\nrespectively, in the centrality range 0-50%. This increase can be attributed\nmostly to an increase of the average transverse momentum between the two\nenergies. The measurements are found to be compatible with hydrodynamic model\ncalculations. This comparison provides a unique opportunity to test the\nvalidity of the hydrodynamic picture and the power to further discriminate\nbetween various possibilities for the temperature dependence of shear viscosity\nto entropy density ratio of the produced matter in heavy-ion collisions at the\nhighest energies.\n", "  Nanodiamonds (NDs) hosting optically active defects are an important\ntechnical material for applications in quantum sensing, biological imaging, and\nquantum optics. The negatively charged silicon vacancy (SiV) defect is known to\nfluoresce in molecular sized NDs (1 to 6 nm) and its spectral properties depend\non the quality of the surrounding host lattice. This defect is therefore a good\nprobe to investigate the material properties of small NDs. Here we report\nunprecedented narrow optical transitions for SiV colour centers hosted in\nnanodiamonds produced using a novel high-pressure high-temperature (HPHT)\ntechnique. The SiV zero-phonon lines were measured to have an inhomogeneous\ndistribution of 1.05 nm at 5 K across a sample of numerous NDs. Individual\nspectral lines as narrow as 354 MHz were measured for SiV centres in\nnanodiamonds smaller than 200 nm, which is four times narrower than the best\nSiV line previously reported for nanodiamonds. Correcting for apparent spectral\ndiffusion yielded a homogeneous linewith of about 200 MHz, which is close to\nthe width limit imposed by the radiative lifetime. These results demonstrate\nthat the direct HPHT synthesis technique is capable of producing nanodiamonds\nwith high crystal lattice quality, which are therefore a valuable technical\nmaterial.\n", "  In homogeneous and isotropic Friedmann-Robertson-Walker cosmology, the\ntopology of the universe determines its ultimate fate. If the Weak Energy\nCondition is satisfied, open and flat universes must expand forever, while\nclosed cosmologies can recollapse to a Big Crunch. A similar statement holds\nfor homogeneous but anisotropic (Bianchi) universes. Here, we prove that\n$arbitrarily$ inhomogeneous and anisotropic cosmologies with \"flat\" (including\ntoroidal) and \"open\" (including compact hyperbolic) spatial topology that are\ninitially expanding must continue to expand forever at least in some region at\na rate bounded from below by a positive number, despite the presence of\narbitrarily large density fluctuations and/or the formation of black holes.\nBecause the set of 3-manifold topologies is countable, a single integer\ndetermines the ultimate fate of the universe, and, in a specific sense, most\n3-manifolds are \"flat\" or \"open\". Our result has important implications for\ninflation: if there is a positive cosmological constant (or suitable\ninflationary potential) and initial conditions for the inflaton, cosmologies\nwith \"flat\" or \"open\" topology must expand forever in some region at least as\nfast as de Sitter space, and are therefore very likely to begin inflationary\nexpansion eventually, regardless of the scale of the inflationary energy or the\nspectrum and amplitude of initial inhomogeneities and gravitational waves. Our\nresult is also significant for numerical general relativity, which often makes\nuse of periodic (toroidal) boundary conditions.\n", "  A DES railgun increases the launch efficiency when compared to a simple\nrailgun setup. In a NGSPICE-simulation a DES and a simple railgun setup\nconnected to an existing 10-MJ capacitor based power supply are compared.\nImportant parameters like velocity, power and efficiency are used to quantify\nthe performance gain, when using the mechanically more complex DES setup. The\nresults of this study were used to select the simple railgun setup as the\ndesign for a new barrel to the 10-MJ power supply.\n", "  Temporal steering is a form of temporal correlation between the initial and\nfinal state of a quantum system. It is a temporal analogue of the famous\nEinstein-Podolsky-Rosen (spatial) steering. We demonstrate, by measuring the\nphoton polarization, that temporal steering allows two parties to verify if\nthey have been interacting with the same particle, even if they have no\ninformation about what happened with the particle in between the measurements.\nThis is the first experimental study of temporal steering. We also performed\nexperimental tests, based on the violation of temporal steering inequalities,\nof the security of two quantum key distribution protocols against individual\nattacks. Thus, these results can lead to applications for secure quantum\ncommunications and quantum engineering.\n", "  The rise of big data systems has created a need for benchmarks to measure and\ncompare the capabilities of these systems. Big data benchmarks present unique\nscalability challenges. The supercomputing community has wrestled with these\nchallenges for decades and developed methodologies for creating rigorous\nscalable benchmarks (e.g., HPC Challenge). The proposed PageRank pipeline\nbenchmark employs supercomputing benchmarking methodologies to create a\nscalable benchmark that is reflective of many real-world big data processing\nsystems. The PageRank pipeline benchmark builds on existing prior scalable\nbenchmarks (Graph500, Sort, and PageRank) to create a holistic benchmark with\nmultiple integrated kernels that can be run together or independently. Each\nkernel is well defined mathematically and can be implemented in any programming\nenvironment. The linear algebraic nature of PageRank makes it well suited to\nbeing implemented using the GraphBLAS standard. The computations are simple\nenough that performance predictions can be made based on simple computing\nhardware models. The surrounding kernels provide the context for each kernel\nthat allows rigorous definition of both the input and the output for each\nkernel. Furthermore, since the proposed PageRank pipeline benchmark is scalable\nin both problem size and hardware, it can be used to measure and quantitatively\ncompare a wide range of present day and future systems. Serial implementations\nin C++, Python, Python with Pandas, Matlab, Octave, and Julia have been\nimplemented and their single threaded performance has been measured.\n", "  In this paper, we investigate the quasiparticle scattering interference(QPI)\nin the nematic phase of iron pnictides, based on the magnetic and orbital\nscenarios of nematicity, respectively. In the spin density wave(SDW) state, the\nQPI pattern exhibits a dimer structure in the energy region of the SDW gap,\nwith its orientation along the ferromagnetic direction of the SDW order. When\nthe energy is increased to be near the Fermi level, it exhibits two sets of\ndimers along the same direction. The dimer structure of the QPI patterns\npersists with the decrease of the SDW correlation length in the magnetic driven\nnematic phase, although it tends to merge together for the scattering patterns\nwith energies close to the Fermi level. While in the orbital scenario, the QPI\npatterns exhibit a dimer structure in a wide energy region. It undergoes a\n{\\pi}/2 rotation with the increasing of energy, which is associated with the\ninequivalent energies of the two Dirac nodes induced by the orbital order.\nThese distinct features may be used to probe or distinguish two kinds of\nscenarios of the nemeticity.\n", "  We show that the Morita equivalences $\\mathrm{Cliff}(4) \\simeq {\\mathbb H}$,\n$\\mathrm{Cliff}(7) \\simeq \\mathrm{Cliff}(-1)$, and $\\mathrm{Cliff}(8) \\simeq\n{\\mathbb R}$ arise from quantizing the Hamiltonian reductions ${\\mathbb\nR}^{0|4} // \\mathrm{Spin}(3)$, ${\\mathbb R}^{0|7} // G_2$, and ${\\mathbb\nR}^{0|8} // \\mathrm{Spin}(7)$, respectively.\n", "  Charged excitons called trions play an important role in the fundamental\nvalley dynamics in the newly emerging 2D semiconductor materials. We used\nultrafast pump- probe spectroscopy to study the valley trion dynamics in a\nMoSe$_2$ monolayer grown by using chemical vapor deposition. The dynamics\ndisplay an ultrafast trion formation followed by a non-exponential decay. The\nmeasurements at different pump fluences show that the trion decay dynamics\nbecome slower as the excitation density increases. The observed trion dynamics\nand the associated density dependence are a result of the trapping by two\ndefect states as being the dominating decay mechanism. The simulation based on\na set of rate equations reproduces the experimental data for different pump\nfluences. Our results reveal the important trion dynamics and identify the\ntrapping by defect states as the primary trion decay mechanism in monolayer\nMoSe$_2$ under the excitation densities used in our experiment.\n", "  We study explicit formulas for phaseless inverse scattering in the Born\napproximation at high energies for the Schr\\\"odinger equation with compactly\nsupported potential in dimension d $\\ge$ 2. We obtain error estimates for these\nformulas in the configuration space.\n", "  Fe pnictides and related materials have been a topic of intense research for\nunderstanding the complex interplay between magnetism and superconductivity.\nHere we report on the magnetic structure of SrMn$_{2}$As$_{2}$ that\ncrystallizes in a trigonal structure ($P\\bar{3}m1$) and undergoes an\nantiferromagnetic (AFM) transition at $T_{\\textrm c}$ $= 118(2)$ K. The\nmagnetic susceptibility remains nearly constant at temperatures $T \\le\nT_{\\textrm N}$ with $\\textbf{H}\\parallel \\textbf{c}$ whereas it decreases\nsignificantly with $\\textbf{H}\\parallel \\textbf{ab}$. This shows that the\nordered Mn moments lie in the $\\textbf{ab}$-plane instead of aligning along the\n$\\textbf{c}$-axis as in tetragonal BaMn$_{2}$As$_{2}$. Single-crystal neutron\ndiffraction measurements on SrMn$_{2}$As$_{2}$ demonstrate that the Mn moments\nare ordered in a collinear N\\'{e}el AFM phase with $180^\\circ$ AFM alignment\nbetween a moment and all nearest neighbor moments in the basal plane and also\nperpendicular to it. Moreover, quasi-two-dimensional AFM order is manifested in\nSrMn$_{2}$As$_{2}$ as evident from the temperature dependence of the order\nparameter.\n", "  Crystallographic, electronic transport, thermal and magnetic properties are\nreported for SrMn2As2 and CaMn2As2 single crystals grown using Sn flux.\nRietveld refinements of powder x-ray diffraction data show that the two\ncompounds are isostructural and crystallize in the trigonal CaAl2Si2-type\nstructure (space group P-3m1), in agreement with the literature. Electrical\nresistivity rho versus temperature T measurements demonstrate insulating ground\nstates for both compounds with activation energies of 85 meV for SrMn2As2 and\n61 meV for CaMn2As2. In a local-moment picture, the Mn^{+2} 3d^5 ions are\nexpected to have high-spin S = 5/2 with spectroscopic splitting factor g = 2.\nMagnetic susceptibility chi and heat capacity measurements versus T reveal\nantiferromagnetic (AFM) transitions at TN = 120(2) K and 62(3) K for SrMn2As2\nand CaMn2As2, respectively. The anisotropic chi(T < TN) data indicate that the\nhexagonal c axis is the hard axis and hence that the ordered Mn moments are\naligned in the ab plane. The chi(T) for both compounds and Cp(T) data for\nSrMn2As2 show strong dynamic short-range AFM correlations from TN up to at\nleast 900 K, likely associated with quasi-two-dimensional connectivity of\nstrong AFM exchange interactions between the Mn spins within the corrugated\nhoneycomb Mn layers parallel to the ab plane.\n", "  Nonlinear excitation of low frequency zonal structure (LFZS) by beta-induced\nAlfven eigenmode (BAE) is investigated using nonlinear gyrokinetic theory. It\nis found that electrostatic zonal flow (ZF), rather than zonal current, is\npreferentially excited by finite amplitude BAE. In addition to the well-known\nmeso-scale radial envelope structure, ZF is also found to exhibit fine radial\nstructure due to the localization of BAE with respect to mode rational\nsurfaces. Specifically, the zonal electric field has an even mode structure at\nthe rational surface where radial envelope peaks.\n", "  We study the Haldane-Hubbard model by exact Renormalization Group techniques.\nWe construct the topological phase diagram, for weak interactions. We predict\nthat many-body interactions induce a shift of the transition line. The presence\nof new intermediate phases, absent in the non interacting case, is rigorously\nexcluded at weak coupling. Despite the nontrivial renormalization of the wave\nfunction and of the Fermi velocity, the conductivity is universal: at the\nrenormalized critical line, both the discontinuity of the transverse\nconductivity and the longitudinal conductivity do not depend on the\ninteraction, thanks to remarkable cancellations due to lattice Ward Identities.\n", "  We numerically investigate global properties of rotating neutron stars using\nthe allowed band of QCD equations of state derived by Kurkela et al. This band\nis constrained by chiral effective theory at low densities and perturbative QCD\nat high densities, and is thus, in essence, a controlled constraint from\nfirst-principles physics. Previously, this band of equations of state was used\nto investigate non-rotating neutron stars only; in this work, we extend these\nresults to any rotation frequency below the mass-shedding limit. We investigate\nmass--radius curves, allowed mass--frequency regions, radius--frequency curves\nfor a typical 1.4-solar-mass star, and the values of the moment of inertia of\nthe double pulsar PSR J0737-3039A, a pulsar whose moment of inertia may be\nconstrained observationally in a few years. We present limits on observational\ndata coming from these constraints, and identify values of\nobservationally-relevant parameters that would further constrain the allowed\nregion for the QCD equation of state. We also discuss how much this region\nwould be constrained by a measurement of the moment of inertial of the double\npulsar PSR J0737-3039A.\n", "  The Hofstadter butterfly of lattice electrons in a strong magnetic field is a\ncornerstone of condensed matter physics, exploring the competition between\nperiodicities imposed by the lattice and the field. In this work we introduce\nand characterize the Weyl butterfly, which emerges when a large magnetic field\nis applied to a three-dimensional Weyl semimetal. Using an experimentally\nmotivated lattice model for cold atomic systems, we solve this problem\nnumerically. We find that Weyl nodes reemerge at commensurate fluxes and\npropose using wavepackets dynamics to reveal their chirality and location.\nMoreover, we show that the chiral anomaly -- a hallmark of the topological Weyl\nsemimetal -- does not remain proportional to magnetic field at large fields,\nbut rather inherits a fractal structure of linear regimes as a function of\nexternal field. The slope of each linear regime is determined by the difference\nof two Chern numbers in gaps of the Weyl butterfly and can be measured\nexperimentally in time of flight.\n", "  We consider the dynamics of a two-level system (qubit) driven by strong and\nshort resonant pulses in the framework of Floquet theory. First we derive\nanalytical expressions for the quasienergies and Floquet states of the driven\nsystem. If the pulse amplitude varies very slowly, the system adiabatically\nfollows the instantaneous Floquet states, which acquire dynamical phases that\ndepend on the evolution of the quasienergies over time. The difference between\nthe phases acquired by the two Floquet states corresponds to a qubit state\nrotation, generalizing the notion of Rabi oscillations to the case of large\ndriving amplitudes. If the pulse amplitude changes very fast, the evolution is\nnon-adiabatic, with transitions taking place between the Floquet states. We\nquantify and analyze the nonadiabatic transitions during the pulse by employing\nadiabatic perturbation theory and exact numerical simulations. We find that,\nfor certain combinations of pulse rise and fall times and maximum driving\namplitude, a destructive interference effect leads to a remarkably strong\nsuppression of transitions between the Floquet states. This effect provides the\nbasis of a quantum control protocol, which we name Floquet Interference\nEfficient Suppression of Transitions in the Adiabatic basis (FIESTA), that can\nbe used to design ultra-fast high-fidelity single-qubit quantum gates.\n", "  The nuclear density dependencies of the neutron and $\\Sigma$ and $\\Lambda$\nhyperons are important inputs in the determination of the neutron star mass as\nthe appearance of hyperons coming from strong attractions significantly changes\nthe stiffness of the equation of state (EOS) at iso-spin asymmetric dense\nnuclear matter. In-medium spectral sum rules have been analyzed for the\nnucleon, $\\Sigma$, and $\\Lambda$ hyperon to investigate their properties up to\nslightly above the saturation nuclear matter density by using the linear\ndensity approximation for the condensates. The construction scheme of the\ninterpolating fields without derivatives has been reviewed and used to\nconstruct a general interpolating field for each baryon with parameters\nspecifying the strength of independent interpolating fields. Optimal choices\nfor the interpolating fields were obtained by requiring the sum rules to be\nstable against variations of the parameters and the result to be consistent\nwith known phenomenology. The optimized result shows that Ioffe's choice is not\nsuitable for the $\\Lambda$ hyperon sum rules. It is found that, for the\n$\\Lambda$ hyperon interpolating field, the up and down quark combined into the\nscalar diquark structure $u^T C \\gamma_5 d$ should be emphasized to ensure\nstable sum rules. The quasi-$\\Sigma$ and -$\\Lambda$ hyperon energies are always\nfound to be higher than the quasineutron energy in the region $0.5\n<\\rho/\\rho_0<1.5 $ where the linear density approximation in the sum-rule\nanalysis is expected to be reliable.\n", "  We describe modeling approaches to a \"network\" of connected enzyme-catalyzed\nreactions, with added (bio)chemical processes that introduce biochemical\nfiltering steps into the functioning of such a biocatalytic cascade.\nTheoretical expressions are derived that allow simple, few-parameter modeling\nof processes concatenated in such cascades, both with and without filtering.\nThe modeling approach captures and explains features identified in earlier\nstudies of enzymatic processes considered as potential \"network components\" for\nmulti-step information/signal processing systems.\n", "  Evaluating accessible conformational space is computationally expensive and\nthermal motions are partly neglected in computer models of molecular\ninteractions. This produces error into the estimates of binding strength. We\nintroduce a method for modelling interactions so that structural flexibility is\ninherently taken into account. It has a statistical model for 3D properties of\n'nonlocal' contacts and a physics based description of 'local' interactions,\nbased on mechanical torque. The form of the torque barrier is derived using a\nrepresentation of the local electronic structure, which is presumed to improve\ntransferability, compared to traditional force fields. The nonlocal contacts\nare more distant than 1-4 interactions and Target-atoms are represented by 3D\nprobability densities. Probability mass quantifies strength of contact and is\ncalculated as an overlap integral. Repulsion is described by negative\nprobability density, allowing probability mass to be used as the descriptor of\ncontact preference. As a result, we are able to transform the high-dimensional\nproblem into a simpler evaluation of three-dimensional integrals. We outline\nhow this scoring function gives a tool to study the enthalpy--entropy\ncompensation and demonstrate the feasibility of our approach by evaluating\nnumerical probability masses for chosen side chain to main chain contacts in a\nlysine dipeptide structure.\n", "  A search with the ATLAS detector is presented for the Standard Model Higgs\nboson produced by vector-boson fusion and decaying to a pair of bottom quarks,\nusing 20.2 ${fb}^{-1}$ of LHC proton-proton collision data at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 8\nTeV. The signal is searched for as a resonance in the invariant mass\ndistribution of a pair of jets containing $b$-hadrons in vector-boson-fusion\ncandidate events. The yield is measured to be $-0.8 \\pm 2.3$ times the Standard\nModel cross-section for a Higgs boson mass of 125 GeV. The upper limit on the\ncross-section times the branching ratio is found to be 4.4 times the Standard\nModel cross-section at the 95% confidence level, consistent with the expected\nlimit value of 5.4 (5.7) in the background-only (Standard Model production)\nhypothesis.\n", "  The large $N_c$ limit provides relations that can be used to calculate the\n$\\gamma^\\ast N \\to \\Delta(1232)$ quadrupole form factors at low and\nintermediate $Q^2$ under the assumption of the pion cloud dominance. There are\ntwo limitations in those parametrizations. First, the parametrization of the\nCoulomb quadrupole form factor underestimate the low $Q^2$ data. Second, when\nextrapolated for the timelike region, the form factors violate Siegert's\ntheorem by terms of the order $1/N_c^2$. We propose here corrections to the\nparametrization of the electric quadrupole form factor, which violate Siegert's\ntheorem only by terms of the order $1/N_c^4$. Combining the improved large\n$N_c$ pion cloud parametrizations with the valence quark contributions based on\na covariant quark model for the quadrupole transition form factors, we obtain\nan extrapolation to the timelike region consistent with Siegert's theorem, and\naccomplish also a very good description of the data.\n", "  We report magnetic susceptibility \\chi, isothermal magnetization M, heat\ncapacity C_p and electrical resistivity \\rho measurements on undoped EuMn2As2\nand K-doped Eu0.96K0.04Mn2As2 and Eu0.93K0.07Mn2As2 single crystals with the\ntrigonal CaAl2Si2-type structure as a function of temperature T and magnetic\nfield H. EuMn2As2 has an insulating ground state with an activation energy of\n52 meV and exhibits antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering of the Eu+2 spins S=7/2 at\nT_N1 = 15 K from C_p(T) and \\chi(T) data with a likely spin-reorientation\ntransition at T_N2 = 5.0 K. The Mn+2 3d5 spins-5/2 exhibit AFM ordering at T_N\n= 142 K from all three types of measurements. The M(H) isotherm and \\chi(T)\ndata indicate that the Eu AFM structure is both noncollinear and noncoplanar.\nThe AFM structure of the Mn spins is also unclear. A 4% substitution of K for\nEu in Eu0.96K0.04Mn2As2 is sufficient to induce a metallic ground state.\nEvidence is found for a difference in the AFM structure of the Eu moments in\nthe metallic crystals from that of undoped EuMn2As2 versus both T and H. For\nmetallic Eu0.96K0.04Mn2As2 and Eu0.93K0.07Mn2As2, an anomalous S-shape T\ndependence of \\rho related to the Mn magnetism is found. Upon cooling from 200\nK, \\rho exhibits a strong negative curvature, reaches maximum positive slope at\nthe Mn T_N ~ 150 K, and then continues to decrease but more slowly below T_N.\nThis suggests that dynamic short-range AFM order of the Mn spins above the Mn\nT_N strongly suppresses the resistivity, contrary to the conventional decrease\nof \\rho that is only observed upon cooling below T_N of an antiferromagnet.\n", "  The success probability in an ancilla based circuit generally decreases\nexponentially in the number of qubits consisted in the ancilla. Although the\nprobability can be amplified through the amplitude amplification process, the\ninput dependence of the amplitude amplification makes difficult to sequentially\ncombine two or more ancilla based circuits. A new version of the amplitude\namplification known as the oblivious amplitude amplification runs independently\nof the input to the system register. This allow us to to sequentially combine\ntwo or more ancilla based circuits. However, this type of the amplification\nonly works when the considered system is unitary or non-unitary but somehow\nclose to a unitary.\n  In this paper, we present a general framework to simulate non-unitary\nmatrices on ancilla based quantum circuits in which the success probability is\nmaximized by using the oblivious amplitude amplification. In particular, we\nshow how to extend a non-unitary matrix to an almost unitary matrix. We then\nsimulate the extended matrix by using an ancilla based circuit design along\nwith the oblivious amplitude amplification. Measuring the distance of the\nproduced matrix to the closest unitary unitary matrix, a lower bound for the\nfidelity of the final state obtained from the oblivious amplitude amplification\nprocess is presented. Numerical simulations for random matrices of different\nsizes show that independent of the system size, the final amplified\nprobabilities are generally around 0.75 and the fidelity of the final state is\nmostly high and around 0.95. Furthermore, we discuss the complexity analysis\nand show that combining two such ancilla based circuits, a matrix product can\nbe implemented. This may lead us to efficiently implement matrix functions\nrepresented as infinite matrix products on quantum computers.\n", "  The GraphBLAS standard (GraphBlas.org) is being developed to bring the\npotential of matrix based graph algorithms to the broadest possible audience.\nMathematically the Graph- BLAS defines a core set of matrix-based graph\noperations that can be used to implement a wide class of graph algorithms in a\nwide range of programming environments. This paper provides an introduction to\nthe mathematics of the GraphBLAS. Graphs represent connections between vertices\nwith edges. Matrices can represent a wide range of graphs using adjacency\nmatrices or incidence matrices. Adjacency matrices are often easier to analyze\nwhile incidence matrices are often better for representing data. Fortunately,\nthe two are easily connected by matrix mul- tiplication. A key feature of\nmatrix mathematics is that a very small number of matrix operations can be used\nto manipulate a very wide range of graphs. This composability of small number\nof operations is the foundation of the GraphBLAS. A standard such as the\nGraphBLAS can only be effective if it has low performance overhead. Performance\nmeasurements of prototype GraphBLAS implementations indicate that the overhead\nis low.\n", "  Microtubule dynamic instability allows search and capture of kinetochores\nduring spindle formation, an important process for accurate chromosome\nsegregation during cell division. Recent work has found that microtubule\nrotational diffusion about minus-end attachment points contributes to\nkinetochore capture in fission yeast, but the relative contributions of dynamic\ninstability and rotational diffusion are not well understood. We have developed\na biophysical model of kinetochore capture in small fission-yeast nuclei using\nhybrid Brownian dynamics/kinetic Monte Carlo simulation techniques. With this\nmodel, we have studied the importance of dynamic instability and microtubule\nrotational diffusion for kinetochore capture, both to the lateral surface of a\nmicrotubule and at or near its end. Over a range of biologically relevant\nparameters, microtubule rotational diffusion decreased capture time, but made a\nrelatively small contribution compared to dynamic instability. At most,\nrotational diffusion reduced capture time by 25%. Our results suggest that\nwhile microtubule rotational diffusion can speed up kinetochore capture, it is\nunlikely to be the dominant physical mechanism. In addition, we found that when\nmicrotubules undergo dynamic instability, lateral captures predominate even in\nthe absence of rotational diffusion. Counterintuitively, adding rotational\ndiffusion to a dynamic microtubule increases the probability of end-on capture.\n", "  We consider a biased Normal-Superconducting junction with various types of\nsuperconductivity. Depending on the class of superconductivity, a Majorana\nbound state may appear at the interface. We show that this has important\nconsequences on the distribution of waiting times of electrons flowing out of\nsuch an interface. Therefore, the waiting time distribution is shown to be a\nclear fingerprint of Majorana bound state physics and may be considered as an\nexperimental signature of its presence.\n", "  We have measured for the first time the charge-changing cross sections\n($\\sigma_{\\text{CC}}$) of $^{12-16}$C on a $^{12}$C target at energies below\n$100A$ MeV. To analyze these low-energy data, we have developed a finite-range\nGlauber model with a global parameter set within the optical-limit\napproximation which is applicable to reaction cross section\n($\\sigma_{\\text{R}}$) and $\\sigma_{\\text{CC}}$ measurements at incident\nenergies from 10$A$ to $2100A$ MeV. Adopting the proton-density distribution of\n$^{12}$C known from the electron-scattering data, as well as the bare total\nnucleon-nucleon cross sections, and the real-to-imaginary-part ratios of the\nforward proton-proton elastic scattering amplitude available in the\nliteratures, we determine the energy-dependent slope parameter $\\beta_{\\rm pn}$\nof the proton-neutron elastic differential cross section so as to reproduce the\nexisting $\\sigma_{\\text{R}}$ and interaction-cross-section data for\n$^{12}$C+$^{12}$C over a wide range of incident energies. The Glauber model\nthus formulated is applied to calculate the $\\sigma_{\\text{\\tiny R}}$'s of\n$^{12}$C on a $^9$Be and $^{27}$Al targets at various incident energies. Our\ncalculations show excellent agreement with the experimental data. Applying our\nmodel to the $\\sigma_{\\text{\\tiny R}}$ and $\\sigma_{\\text{\\tiny CC}}$ for the\n\"neutron-skin\" $^{16}$C nucleus, we reconfirm the importance of measurements at\nincident energies below $100A$ MeV. The proton root-mean-square radii of\n$^{12-16}$C are extracted using the measured $\\sigma_{\\text{CC}}$'s and the\nexisting $\\sigma_{\\text{R}}$ data. The results for $^{12-14}$C are consistent\nwith the values from the electron scatterings, demonstrating the feasibility,\nusefulness of the $\\sigma_{\\text{CC}}$ measurement and the present Glauber\nmodel.\n", "  We perform the canonical and path integral quantizations of a lower-order\nderivatives model describing Podolsky's generalized electrodynamics. The\nphysical content of the model shows an auxiliary massive vector field coupled\nto the usual electromagnetic field. The equivalence with Podolsky's original\nmodel is studied at classical and quantum levels. Concerning the dynamical time\nevolution we obtain a theory with two first-class and two second-class\nconstraints in phase space. We calculate explicitly the corresponding Dirac\nbrackets involving both vector fields. We use the Senjanovic procedure to\nimplement the second-class constraints and the Batalin-Fradkin-Vilkovisky path\nintegral quantization scheme to deal with the symmetries generated by the\nfirst-class constraints. The physical interpretation of the results turns out\nto be simpler due to the reduced derivatives order permeating the equations of\nmotion, Dirac brackets and effective action.\n", "  We consider near-critical planar systems with boundary conditions inducing\nphase separation. While order parameter correlations decay exponentially in\npure phases, we show by direct field theoretical derivation how phase\nseparation generates long range correlations in the direction parallel to the\ninterface, and determine their exact analytic form. The latter leads to\nspecific contributions to the structure factor of the interface.\n", "  Instability of a binary eutectic solidification front to morphological\nperturbations due to rejection of a ternary impurity leads to the formation of\neutectic colonies. Whereas, the instability dynamics and the resultant mi-\ncrostructural features are reasonably well understood for isotropic systems,\nseveral experimental observations point to the existence of colonies in systems\nwith anisotropic interfaces. In this study, we extend the un- derstanding of\neutectic colonies to anisotropic systems, where only certain orientations of\nthe solid-liquid or solid-solid interfaces are thermodynamically stable.\nThrough phase field simulations in 2D and 3D, we have systematically probed the\ncolony formation dynamics and the resulting microstructures, as functions of\nthe pulling velocity and the relative orientation of the equilibrium interfaces\nwith that of the imposed tempera- ture gradient. We find that in 2D, stabler\nfinger spacings are selected with an increase in the magnitude of anisotropy\nintroduced, either in the solid-liquid or in the solid-solid interface. The\nfingers have a well-defined orientation for the case of anisotropy in the\nsolid-liquid interface, with no fixed orientations for the lamellae\nconstituting the colony. For the case where anisotropy exists in the\nsolid-solid interface, the lamellae tend to orient themselves along the\ndirection of the imposed temperature gradient, with tilted solid-liquid\ninterfaces from the horizontal. The 3D simulations reveal existence of eutectic\nspirals which might become tilted under certain orientations of the equilibrium\ninterfaces. Our simulations are able to explain several key features observed\nin our experimantal studies of solidification in Ni-Al-Zr alloy.\n", "  We calculate the quantum corrections to the gauge-invariant gravitational\npotentials of spinning particles in flat space, induced by loops of both\nmassive and massless matter fields of various types. While the corrections to\nthe Newtonian potential induced by massless conformal matter for spinless\nparticles are well-known, and the same corrections due to massless minimally\ncoupled scalars [Class. Quant. Grav. 27 (2010) 245008], massless non-conformal\nscalars [Phys. Rev. D 87 (2013) 104027] and massive scalars, fermions and\nvector bosons [Phys. Rev. D 91 (2015) 064047] have been recently derived,\nspinning particles receive additional corrections which are the subject of the\npresent work. We give both fully analytic results valid for all distances from\nthe particle, and present numerical results as well as asymptotic expansions.\nAt large distances from the particle, the corrections due to massive fields are\nexponentially suppressed in comparison to the corrections from massless fields,\nas one would expect. However, a surprising result of our analysis is that close\nto the particle itself, on distances comparable to the Compton wavelength of\nthe massive fields running in the loops, these corrections can be enhanced with\nrespect to the massless case.\n", "  A direct search for lepton flavour violating decays of the Higgs boson (H) in\nthe H to e tau and H to e mu channels is described. The data sample used in the\nsearch was collected in proton-proton collisions at sqrt(s) = 8 TeV with the\nCMS detector at the LHC and corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 19.7\ninverse femtobarns. No evidence is found for lepton flavour violating decays in\neither final state. Upper limits on the branching fractions, B(H to e tau ) <\n0.69% and B(H to e mu) < 0.035%, are set at the 95% confidence level. The\nconstraint set on B(H to e tau) is an order of magnitude more stringent than\nthe existing indirect limits. The limits are used to constrain the\ncorresponding flavour violating Yukawa couplings, absent in the standard model.\n", "  Topological Dirac and Weyl semimetals have an energy spectrum that hosts Weyl\nnodes appearing in pairs of opposite chirality. Topological stability is\nensured when the nodes are separated in momentum space and unique spectral and\ntransport properties follow. In this work we study the effect of a space\ndependent Weyl node separation, which we interpret as an emergent background\naxial vector potential, on the electromagnetic response and the energy spectrum\nof Weyl and Dirac semimetals. This situation can arise in the solid state\neither from inhomogeneous strain or non-uniform magnetization and can also be\nengineered in cold-atomic systems. Using a semiclassical approach we show that\nthe resulting axial magnetic field $\\mathbf{B}_{5}$ is observable through an\nenhancement of the conductivity as $\\sigma\\sim \\mathbf{B}_{5} ^{2}$ due to an\nunderlying chiral pseudo magnetic effect. We then use two lattice models to\nanalyze the effect of $\\mathbf{B}_5$ on the spectral properties of topological\nsemimetals. We describe the emergent pseudo-Landau level structure for\ndifferent spatial profiles of $\\mathbf{B}_5$, revealing that (i) the celebrated\nsurface states of Weyl semimetals, the Fermi arcs, can be reinterpreted as\n$n=0$ pseudo-Landau levels resulting from a $\\mathbf{B}_5$ confined to the\nsurface (ii) as a consequence of position-momentum locking a bulk\n$\\mathbf{B}_5$ creates pseudo-Landau levels interpolating in real space between\nFermi arcs at opposite surfaces and (iii) there are equilibrium bound currents\nproportional to $\\mathbf{B}_{5}$ that average to zero over the sample, which\nare the analogs of bound currents in magnetic materials. We conclude by\ndiscussing how our findings can be probed experimentally.\n", "  Dielectric properties of BTZ-BCT ceramics were probed in the frequency range\nfrom 10 Hz to 100 THz in a broad temperature range (10-900 K). Polar soft\nphonon observed in infrared spectra softens with cooling, however below 500 K\nits frequency becomes temperature independent. Simultaneously, a central mode\nactivates in terahertz and microwave spectra; and it actually drives the\nferroelectric phase transitions. Consequently, the phase transition strongly\nresemble a crossover between the dispacive and order-disorder type. The central\nmode vanishes below 200 K. The dielectric relaxation in the radiofrequency and\nmicrowave range anomalously broadens on cooling below T$_{C1}$ resulting in the\nnearly frequency independent dielectric loss bleow 200 K. This broadening comes\nfrom a broad frequency distribution of ferroelectric domain wall vibrations.\nRaman spectra reveal new phonons below 400 K, i.e. already 15 K above T$_{C1}$.\nSeveral weak modes are detected in the paraelectric phase up to 500 K in the\nRaman spectra. Activation of these modes is ascribed to the presence of polar\nnanoclusters in the material.\n", "  Here we introduce reflection positive doubles, a general framework for\nreflection positivity, covering a wide variety of systems in statistical\nphysics and quantum field theory. These systems may be bosonic, fermionic, or\nparafermionic in nature. Within the framework of reflection positive doubles,\nwe give necessary and sufficient conditions for reflection positivity. We use a\nreflection-invariant cone to implement our construction. Our characterization\nallows for a direct interpretation in terms of coupling constants, making it\neasy to check in concrete situations. We illustrate our methods with numerous\nexamples.\n", "  Previous analytical studies of quantum electrodynamics in $2+1$ dimensions\n(QED3) have shown the existence of a critical number of fermions for onset of\nchiral symmetry breaking, the most known being the value $N_c\\approx3.28$\nobtained by Nash to $1/N^2$ order in the $1/N$ expansion [16]. This analysis is\nreconsidered by solving the Dyson-Schwinger equations for the fermion\npropagator and the vertex to show that the more accurate gauge independent\nvalue is $N_c\\approx2.85$, and for $N<N_c$ the chiral symmetry is dynamically\nbroken. An estimate for the value of chiral condensate\n$\\langle\\bar\\psi\\psi\\rangle$ is given for $N=2$. Knowing precise $N_c$ would be\nimportant for comparison between continuum studies and lattice simulations of\nQED3.\n", "  Cluster perturbation theory is used to calculate band structure, spectral\nfunctions, Fermi surface, and spin and charge susceptibilities for the\ntwo-orbital model of iron pnictides with the on-site multiorbital Hubbard\ninteractions. Susceptibilities are calculated within the approximation\ncombining the cluster perturbation theory for the self-energy corrections and\nthe random-phase approximation (RPA) for the vertex renormalizations.\nCalculations for the small values of Hubbard repulsion $U \\leq 2$ confirm that\nthe rigid band approximation and RPA for the spin and charge susceptibilities\nare suitable approaches for the case of weak interactions.\n", "  An underwater in situ gamma ray spectrometer based on LaBr3 was developed and\noptimized to monitor marine radioactivity. The intrinsic background mainly from\nLa138 and Ac227 of LaBr3 was well determined by low background measurement and\npulse shape discrimination method. A method of self-calibration using three\ninternal contaminant peaks was proposed to eliminate the peak shift during long\nterm monitoring. With experiments under different temperatures, the method was\nproved to be helpful for maintaining long term stability. To monitor the marine\nradioactivity, the spectrometer efficiency was calculated via water tank\nexperiment as well as Monte Carlo simulation.\n", "  We employ equation of motion techniques to study the non-equilibrium dynamics\nin a lattice model of weakly interacting spinless fermions. Our model provides\na simple setting for analyzing the effects of weak integrability breaking\nperturbations on the time evolution after a quantum quench. We establish the\naccuracy of the method by comparing results at short and intermediate times to\ntime-dependent density matrix renormalization group computations. For\nsufficiently weak integrability-breaking interactions we always observe\nprethermalization plateaux, where local observables relax to non-thermal values\nat intermediate time scales. At later times a crossover towards thermal\nbehaviour sets in. We determine the associated time scale, which depends on the\ninitial state, the band structure of the non-interacting theory, and the\nstrength of the integrability breaking perturbation. Our method allows us to\nanalyze in some detail the spreading of correlations and in particular the\nstructure of the associated light cones in our model. We find that the interior\nand exterior of the light cone are separated by an intermediate region, the\ntemporal width of which appears to scale with a universal power-law $t^{1/3}$.\n", "  In these notes I survey geometric aspects of the lowest Landau level wave\nfunctions, integer quantum Hall state and Laughlin states on compact Riemann\nsurfaces. In particular, I review geometric adiabatic transport on the moduli\nspaces, derivation of the electromagnetic and gravitational anomalies,\nChern-Simons theory and adiabatic phase, and the relation to holomorphic line\nbundles, Quillen metric, regularized spectral determinants, bosonisation\nformulas on Riemann surfaces and asymptotic expansion of the Bergman kernel.\n", "  We consider a discrete-time continuous-space random walk under the\nconstraints that the number of returns to the origin (local time) and the total\narea under the walk are fixed. We first compute the joint probability of an\nexcursion having area $a$ and returning to the origin for the first time after\ntime $\\tau$. We then show how condensation occurs when the total area\nconstraint is increased: an excursion containing a finite fraction of the area\nemerges. Finally we show how the phenomena generalises previously studied cases\nof condensation induced by several constraints and how it is related to\ninteraction-driven condensation which allows us to explain the phenomenon in\nthe framework of large deviation theory.\n", "  The aim of this work is to show that the origin of the Fundamental Plane (FP)\nrelation for early-type galaxies (ETGs) can be traced back to the existence of\na fine-tuning between the average star formation rate $<SFR>$ of galaxies and\ntheir structural and dynamical characteristics. To get such result it is\nnecessary to imagine the existence of two distinct \"virtual planes\" for each\ngalaxy in the $\\log(R_e)-\\log(I_e)-\\log(\\sigma)$ space. The first one (named\nVirial Plane VP) represents the total galaxy mass using the scalar Virial\nTheorem and the mass-to-light ratio $M/L$, while the second plane comes from an\nexpression of the total galaxy luminosity as a function of the mean star\nformation rate $<SFR>$ and the velocity dispersion $\\sigma$, through a relation\n$L=L'_0 \\sigma^{-2}$ (named here pseudo-Faber-Jackson (PFJ)) which is a\nmathematical convenient way for expressing the independency of light from the\nvirial equilibrium. Its validity can be connected to the mutual correlation\n$L\\sim\\sigma\\sqrt{<SFR>}$ observed for all ETGs.\n  A posteriori it is possible to see that this approach permits to explain the\nobserved properties of the FP (tilt and scatter) and the Zone of Exclusions\n(ZOE) visible in the FP projections. Furthermore, the link between the\nproperties of the FP and the SFR of galaxies provides a new idea of the star\nformation, as a phenomenon driven by the initial conditions of proto-galaxies\nand regulated across the whole cosmic history by the variation of the main\ngalaxy parameters (mass, luminosity, structural shape and velocity dispersion).\n", "  The production of hadronic resonances $K^{*}(892)$, $\\phi(1020)$,\n$\\Sigma^{*}(1385)$, and $\\Xi^{*}(1530)$ in central AA collisions at\n$\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$ 17.3, 200, and 2760 GeV are systematically studied. The direct\nproduction of these resonances at system hadronization are described by the\nquark combination model and the effects of hadron multiple-scattering stage are\ndealt with by a ultra-relativistic quantum molecular dynamics model (UrQMD). We\nstudy the contribution of these two production sources to final observation and\ncompare the final spectra with the available experimental data. The $p_T$\nspectra of $K^{*}(892)$ calculated directly by quark combination model are\nexplicitly higher than the data at low $p_T \\lesssim 1.5$ GeV and taking into\naccount the modification of rescattering effects the resulting final spectra\nwell agree with the data at all three collision energies. The rescattering\neffect on $\\phi(1020)$ production is weak and including it can slightly improve\nour description at low $p_T$ on the basis of overall agreement with the data.\nWe also predict the $p_T$ spectra of $\\Sigma^{*}(1385)$ and $\\Xi^{*}(1530)$ to\nbe tested by the future experimental data.\n", "  Using Weitzenb\\\"ock Induced Matter Theory (WIMT), we study Schwarzschild\nwormholes performing different foliations on an extended (non-vaccuum) 5D\nmanifold. We explore the geodesic equations for observers which are in the\ninterior of a traversable wormhole and how these observers can detect\ngravito-magnetic monopoles which are dual to gravito-electric sources observed\nin the outer zone of some Schwarzschild Black-Hole (BH). The densities of these\nmonopoles are calculated and quantized in the Dirac sense. This kind of duality\non the extended Einstein-Maxwell equations, relates electric and magnetic\ncharges on causally disconnected space regions.\n", "  We study non-local correlations in a three-orbital Hubbard model defined on\nan extended one-dimensional chain using determinant quantum Monte Carlo and\ndensity matrix renormalization group methods. We focus on a parameter with\nrobust Hund's coupling, which produces an orbital selective Mott phase (OSMP)\nat intermediate values of the Hubbard U, as well as an orbitally ordered\nferromagnetic insulating state at stronger coupling. An examination of the\norbital and spin-correlation functions indicates that the orbital ordering\noccurs before the onset of magnetic correlations in this parameter regime as a\nfunction of temperature. In the OSMP, we find that the self-energy for the\nitinerant electrons is momentum dependent, indicating a degree of non-local\ncorrelations while the localized electrons have largely momentum independent\nself-energies. These non-local correlations also produce relative shifts of the\nhole-like and electron-like bands within our model. The overall momentum\ndependence of these quantities is strongly suppressed in the orbitally-ordered\ninsulating phase.\n", "  Dipolar dissociation processes in the electron collisions with carbon\nmonoxide have been studied using time of flight (TOF) mass spectroscopy in\ncombination with the highly differential velocity slice imaging (VSI)\ntechnique. Probing ion-pair states both positive and/or negative ions may be\ndetected. The ion yield curve of negative ions provides the threshold energy\nfor the ion-pair production. On the other hand, the kinetic energy\ndistributions and angular distributions of the fragment anion provide detailed\ndynamics of the dipolar dissociation process. Two ion-pair states have been\nidentified based on angular distribution measurements using VSI technique.\n", "  In this work, we propose and compare four different strategies to simulate\nthe fluid model for streamer propagation in one-dimension (1D) and quasi\ntwo-dimension (2D), which consists of a Poisson's equation for particle\nvelocity and two continuity equations for particle transport. Each strategy\ninvolves of one method for solving Poisson's equation and the other for solving\ncontinuity equations, and a total variation diminishing three-stage Runge-Kutta\nmethod in temporal discretization. The numerical methods for Poisson's equation\ninclude finite volume method, discontinuous Galerkin methods, mixed finite\nelement method and least-squared finite element method. The numerical method\nfor continuity equations is chosen from the family of discontinuous Galerkin\nmethods. The accuracy tests and comparisons show that all of these four\nstrategies are suitable and competitive in streamer simulations from the\naspects of accuracy and efficiency. Results show these methods are compatible.\nBy applying any strategy in real simulations, we can study the dynamics of\nstreamer propagations in both 1D and quasi 2D models.\n", "  The Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) has collected hundreds of hours of Epoch\nof Reionization (EoR) data and now faces the challenge of overcoming foreground\nand systematic contamination to reduce the data to a cosmological measurement.\nWe introduce several novel analysis techniques such as cable reflection\ncalibration, hyper-resolution gridding kernels, diffuse foreground model\nsubtraction, and quality control methods. Each change to the analysis pipeline\nis tested against a two dimensional power spectrum figure of merit to\ndemonstrate improvement. We incorporate the new techniques into a deep\nintegration of 32 hours of MWA data. This data set is used to place a\nsystematic-limited upper limit on the cosmological power spectrum of $\\Delta^2\n\\leq 2.7 \\times 10^4$ mK$^2$ at $k=0.27$ h~Mpc$^{-1}$ and $z=7.1$, consistent\nwith other published limits, and a modest improvement (factor of 1.4) over\nprevious MWA results. From this deep analysis we have identified a list of\nimprovements to be made to our EoR data analysis strategies. These improvements\nwill be implemented in the future and detailed in upcoming publications.\n", "  The kinetics of the OH + CO reaction, fundamental to both atmospheric and\ncombustion chemistry, are complex due to the formation of the HOCO\nintermediate. Despite extensive studies on this reaction, HOCO has not been\nobserved at thermal reaction conditions. Exploiting the sensitive, broadband,\nand high-resolution capabilities of time-resolved cavity-enhanced direct\nfrequency comb spectroscopy, we observe OD + CO reaction kinetics with the\ndetection of stabilized trans-DOCO, the deuterated analogue of trans-HOCO, and\nits yield. By simultaneously measuring the time-dependent concentrations of\nboth trans-DOCO and OD species, we observe unambiguous low-pressure\ntermolecular dependence on the reaction rate coefficients for both N2 and CO\nbath gases. These results confirm the HOCO formation mechanism and quantify its\nyield.\n", "  We performed a thorough investigation of the drying dynamics of a charged\ncolloidal dispersion drop in a confined geometry. We developed an original\nmethodology based on Raman micro-spectroscopy to measure spatially-resolved\ncolloids concentration profiles during the drying of the drop. These\nmeasurements lead, for the first time, to estimates of the collective diffusion\ncoefficient of the dispersion over a wide range of concentration. The\ncollective diffusion coefficient is one order of magnitude higher than the\nStokes-Einstein estimate showing the importance of the electrostatic\ninteractions for the relaxation of concentration gradients. At the same time,\nwe also performed fluorescence imaging of tracers embedded within the\ndispersion during the drying of the drop, which reveals two distinct regimes.\nAt early stages, concentration gradients along the drop lead to\nbuoyancy-induced flows. Strikingly, these flows do not influence the colloidal\nconcentration gradients that generate them, as the mass transport remains\ndominated by diffusion. At longer time scales, the tracers trajectories reveal\nthe formation of a gel which dries quasi homogeneously. For such a gel, we show\nusing linear poro-elastic modeling, that the drying dynamics is still described\nby the same transport equations as for the liquid dispersion. However, the\ncollective diffusion coefficient follows a modified generalized Stokes-Einstein\nrelation, as also demonstrated in the context of unidirectional consolidation\nby Style et al. [Crust formation in drying colloidal suspensions, Style et al.,\nProc. R. Soc. A 467, 174 (2011)].\n", "  We examine a toy model and a cascade effect for confinement and chiral\nsymmetry breaking which consists in several phase transitions corresponding to\nthe formation of bound states and chiral condensates with different number of\nfermions for a strong group. We analyze two examples: regular QCD where we\ncalculate the \"four quark\" vacuum condensate and a preon composite model based\non QCD at higher scales. In this context we also determine the number of\nflavors at which the second chiral and confinement phase transitions occur and\ndiscuss the consequences.\n", "  The QCD sum rules in the large-$N_c$ limit for the light non-strange vector,\naxial and scalar mesons are considered assuming a string-like linear spectrum\nfor the radially excited states. We propose a improved method for combined\nanalysis of these channels that gives a reasonable description of the observed\nspectrum. In the vector-axial case, fixing the pion decay constant and the\ngluon condensate we obtain more or less physical values for the masses of\nground states and the quark condensate. Thus a typical need for this method to\nfix the mass of some ground state is overcome. Using in the scalar channel the\nvalues of presumably universal slope of radial trajectories and the quark\ncondensate obtained in the vector-axial channel, we find that, in contrast to\nsome strong claims in the literature, a prediction of light scalar state with a\nmass close to the mass of $f_0(500)$ seems to be natural in the considered\napproach and may follow in a natural way from the Regge phenomenology.\n", "  Free-space light beams with complex intensity patterns, or non-trivial phase\nstructure, are demanded in diverse fields, ranging from classical and quantum\noptical communications, to manipulation and imaging of microparticles and\ncells. Static or dynamic spatial light modulators, acting on phase or intensity\nof an incoming light wave, are the conventional choices to produce beams with\nsuch non-trivial characteristics. However, interfacing these devices with\noptical fibers or integrated optical circuits often requires difficult\nalignment or cumbersome optical setups. Here we explore theoretically and with\nnumerical simulations the potentialities of directly using the output of\nengineered three-dimensional waveguide arrays, illuminated with linearly\npolarized light, to project light beams with peculiar structures. We\ninvestigate through a collection of illustrative configurations the far field\ndistribution, showing the possibility to achieve orbital angular momentum, or\nto produce elaborate intensity or phase patterns with several singularity\npoints. We also simulate the propagation of the projected beam, showing the\npossibility to concentrate light. We note that these devices should be at reach\nof current technology, thus perspectives are open for the generation of complex\nfree-space optical beams from integrated waveguide circuits.\n", "  Recent observations of $r$-process material in ultra-faint dwarf galaxies\n(UFDs) shed light on the sources of these elements. Strong upper limits on the\nEu mass in some UFDs combined with detections of much larger masses in a UFD,\nReticulum II, and other dwarf galaxies imply that Eu production is dominated by\nrare events, and that the minimal Eu mass observed in any UFD is approximately\nthe amount of Eu mass produced per event. This is consistent with other\nindependent observations in the Galaxy. We estimate, using a model independent\nlikelihood analysis, the rate and Eu (Fe) mass produced per $r$-process (Fe\nproduction) event in dwarf galaxies including classical dwarfs and UFDs. The\nmass and rate of the Fe production events are consistent with the normal\ncore-collapse supernova~(ccSN) scenario. The Eu mass per event is $3\\times\n10^{-5}M_{\\odot}<\\tilde{m}_{\\rm Eu}<2\\times 10^{-4}M_{\\odot}$, corresponding to\na total $r$-process mass per event of $6\\times\n10^{-3}M_{\\odot}<\\tilde{m}_{r-process}<4\\times 10^{-2}M_{\\odot}$. The rate of\n$r$-process events is $2.5\\times 10^{-4}<R_{rp/SN}<1.4\\times 10^{-3}$ as\ncompared with the ccSNe rate. These values are consistent with the total Eu\nmass observed in our own Galaxy, suggesting that the same mechanism is behind\nthe production of $r$-process events in both dwarf galaxies and the Milky Way,\nand that it may be the dominant mechanism for production of $r$-process\nelements in the Universe. The results are consistent with neutron star mergers\nestimates, but cannot rule out other rare core collapse scenarios, provided\nthat they produce a significant amounts of $r$-process material per event.\n", "  Fermionic superfluids provide a new realization of quantum turbulence,\naccessible to both experiment and theory, yet relevant to phenomena from both\ncold atoms to nuclear astrophysics. In particular, the strongly interacting\nFermi gas realized in cold-atom experiments is closely related to dilute\nneutron matter in neutron star crusts. Unlike the liquid superfluids 4He\n(bosons) and 3He (fermions) where quantum turbulence has been studied in the\nlaboratory, superfluid Fermi gases stand apart for a number of reasons. They\nadmit a reliable theoretical description based on a DFT called the TDSLDA that\ndescribes both static and dynamic phenomena. Cold atom experiments demonstrate\nexquisite control over particle number, spin polarization, density,\ntemperature, and interaction strength. Topological defects such as domain walls\nand quantized vortices, which lie at the heart of quantum turbulence, can be\ncreated and manipulated with time-dependent external potentials, and agree with\nthe time-dependent theoretical techniques. While similar experimental and\ntheoretical control exists for weakly interacting Bose gases, the unitary Fermi\ngas is strongly interacting. The resulting vortex line density is extremely\nhigh, and quantum turbulence may thus be realized in small systems where\nclassical turbulence is suppressed. Fermi gases also permit the study of exotic\nsuperfluid phenomena such as a 3D LOFF supersolid, and a finite temperature\npseudo-gap in the regime of classical turbulence. The dynamics associated with\nthese phenomena has only started to be explored. Finally, superfluid mixtures\nhave recently been realized, providing experimental access to phenomena like\nAndreev-Bashkin entrainment. Superfluid Fermi gases thus provide a rich forum\nfor addressing phenomena related to quantum turbulence with applications\nranging from terrestrial superfluidity to astrophysical dynamics in neutron\nstars.\n", "  FELiChEM is a new experimental facility under construction at University of\nScience and Technology of China (USTC), whose core device is two free electron\nlaser oscillators generating middle-infrared and far-infrared laser and\ncovering the spectral range of 2.5-200 $\\mu$m. It will be a dedicated infrared\nlight source aiming at energy chemistry research. We present the brief design\nof FEL oscillators with the emphasis put on the middle-infrared oscillator.\nMost of the basic parameters are determined and the anticipated performance of\nthe output radiation is given. The first light of FELiChEM is targeted for the\nend of 2017.\n", "  The conditional entropy of glueball states is calculated using a holographic\ndescription. Glueball states are represented by a supergravity dual picture,\nconsisting of a 5-dimensional graviton-dilaton action of a dynamical\nholographic AdS/QCD model. The conditional entropy is studied as a function of\nthe glueball spin and of the mass, providing information about the stability of\nthe glueball states.\n", "  We use Richardson-Gaudin exact equations to derive the ground-state energy of\n$N$ composite bosons (cobosons) interacting via a potential which acts between\nfermion pairs having zero center-of-mass momentum, that is, a potential similar\nto the reduced BCS potential used in conventional superconductivity. Through a\ndensity expansion, we show that while, for 2D systems, the $N$-coboson\ncorrelation energy undergoes a surprising cancellation which leaves the\ninteraction part with a $N(N-1)$ dependence only, such a cancellation does not\nexist in 1D, 3D, and 4D systems --- which corresponds to 2D parabolic traps ---\nnor when the cobosons interact via a similar short-range potential but between\npairs having an arbitrary center-of-mass momentum. This shows that the\npreviously-found cancellation which exists for the Cooper-pair correlation\nenergy results not only from the very peculiar form of the reduced BCS\npotential, but also from a quite mysterious dimensionality effect, the density\nof states for Cooper pairs feeling the BCS potential being essentially\nconstant, as for 2D systems.\n", "  When a star passes within the tidal radius of a supermassive black hole, it\nwill be torn apart. For a star with the mass of the Sun ($M_\\odot$) and a\nnon-spinning black hole with a mass $<10^8 M_\\odot$, the tidal radius lies\noutside the black hole event horizon and the disruption results in a luminous\nflare. Here we report observations over a period of 10 months of a transient,\nhitherto interpreted as a superluminous supernova. Our data show that the\ntransient rebrightened substantially in the ultraviolet and that the spectrum\nwent through three different spectroscopic phases without ever becoming\nnebular. Our observations are more consistent with a tidal disruption event\nthan a superluminous supernova because of the temperature evolution, the\npresence of highly ionised CNO gas in the line of sight and our improved\nlocalisation of the transient in the nucleus of a passive galaxy, where the\npresence of massive stars is highly unlikely. While the supermassive black hole\nhas a mass $> 10^8 M_\\odot$, a star with the same mass as the Sun could be\ndisrupted outside the event horizon if the black hole were spinning rapidly.\nThe rapid spin and high black hole mass can explain the high luminosity of this\nevent.\n", "  A systematic study of pressure ionization is carried out in the chemical\npicture by the example of fluid helium. By comparing the variants of the\nchemical model, it is demonstrated that the behavior of pressure ionization\ndepends on the construction of the free energy function. In the chemical model\nwith the Coulomb free energy described by the Pad\\'e interpolation formula,\nthermodynamical instability induced by pressure ionization is found to be\nmanifested by a discontinuous drop or a continuous fall and rise along the\npressure-density curve as well as the pressure-temperature curve, which is very\nmuch like the first order liquid-liquid phase transition of fluid hydrogen from\nthe first principles simulations. In contrast, in the variant chemical model\nwith the Coulomb free energy term empirically weakened, no thermodynamical\ninstability is induced when pressure ionization occurs, and the resulting\nequation of state achieves good agreement with the first principles simulations\nof fluid helium.\n", "  Quantum technology based on cold-atom interferometers is showing great\npromise for fields such as inertial sensing and fundamental physics. However,\nthe best precision achievable on Earth is limited by the free-fall time of the\natoms, and their full potential can only be realized in Space where\ninterrogation times of many seconds will lead to unprecedented sensitivity.\nVarious mission scenarios are presently being pursued which plan to implement\nmatter-wave inertial sensors. Toward this goal, we realize the first onboard\noperation of simultaneous $^{87}$Rb $-$ $^{39}$K interferometers in the\nweightless environment produced during parabolic flight. The large vibration\nlevels ($10^{-2}~g/\\sqrt{\\rm Hz}$), acceleration range ($0-1.8~g$) and rotation\nrates ($5$ deg/s) during flight present significant challenges. We demonstrate\nthe capability of our dual-quantum sensor by measuring the E\\\"{o}tv\\\"{o}s\nparameter with systematic-limited uncertainties of $1.1 \\times 10^{-3}$ and\n$3.0 \\times 10^{-4}$ during standard- and micro-gravity, respectively. This\nconstitutes the first test of the equivalence principle in a free-falling\nvehicle with quantum sensors. Our results are applicable to inertial\nnavigation, and can be extended to the trajectory of a satellite for future\nSpace missions.\n", "  We present an ultra-low noise, high-voltage driver suited for use with\npiezoelectric actuators and other low-current applications. The architecture\nuses a flyback switching regulator to generate up to 250V in our current\ndesign, with an output of 1 kV or more possible with small modifications. A\nhigh slew-rate op-amp suppresses the residual switching noise, yielding a total\nRMS noise of $\\approx 100\\mu$V (1 Hz--100 kHz). A low-voltage ($\\pm 10$V), high\nbandwidth signal can be summed with unity gain directly onto the output, making\nthe driver well-suited for closed-loop feedback applications. Digital control\nenables both repeatable setpoints and sophisticated control logic, and the\ncircuit consumes less than 150mA at $\\pm 15$V.\n", "  We introduce a new foliation of AdS$_5$ black holes such that the conformal\nboundary takes the form of a $4$-dimensional FLRW spacetime with scale factor\n$a(t)$. The foliation employs Eddington-Finkelstein-like coordinates and is\napplicable to a large class of AdS black holes, supported by matter fields or\nnot, considerably extending previous efforts in the literature. We argue that\nthe holographic dual picture of a CFT plasma on a FLRW background provides an\ninteresting prototype to study the nonequilibrium dynamics of expanding plasmas\nand use holographic renormalization to extract the renormalized energy-momentum\ntensor of the dual plasma. We illustrate the procedure for three black holes of\ninterest, namely AdS-Schwarzschild, AdS-Gauss-Bonnet, and\nAdS-Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om. For the latter, as a by-product, we show that the\nnonequilibrium dynamics of a CFT plasma subject to a quench in the chemical\npotential (i.e., a time-dependent chemical potential) resembles a cosmological\nevolution with the scale factor $a(t)$ being inversely related to the quench\nprofile.\n", "  Ideal, completely coherent quantum transport calculations had predicted that\nsuperlattice MOSFETs may offer steep subthreshold swing performance below\n60mV/dec to around 39mV/dec. However, the high carrier density in the\nsuperlattice source suggest that scattering may significantly degrade the ideal\ndevice performance. Such effects of electron scattering and decoherence in the\ncontacts of superlattice MOSFETs are examined through a multiscale quantum\ntransport model developed in NEMO5. This model couples NEGF-based quantum\nballistic transport in the channel to a quantum mechanical density of states\ndominated reservoir, which is thermalized through strong scattering with local\nquasi-Fermi levels determined by drift-diffusion transport. The simulations\nshow that scattering increases the electron transmission in the nominally\nforbidden minigap therefore degrading the subthreshold swing (S.S.) and the\nON/OFF DC current ratio. This degradation varies with both the scattering rate\nand the length of the scattering dominated regions. Different superlattice\nMOSFET designs are explored to mitigate the effects of such deleterious\nscattering. Specifically, shortening the spacer region between the superlattice\nand the channel from 3.5 nm to 0 nm improves the simulated S.S. from 51mV/dec.\nto 40mV/dec. I. INTRODUCTION\n", "  The statistics of Poincar\\'e recurrence times in Hamiltonian systems\ntypically shows a power-law decay with chaotic trajectories sticking to some\nphase-space regions for long times. For higher-dimensional systems the\nmechanism of this power-law trapping is still unknown. We investigate trapped\norbits of a generic 4D symplectic map in phase space and frequency space and\nfind that, in contrast to 2D maps, the trapping is (i) not due to a hierarchy\nin phase space. Instead, it occurs at the surface of the regular region, (ii)\noutside of the Arnold web. The chaotic dynamics in this sticky region is (iii)\ndominated by resonance channels which reach far into the chaotic region: We\nobserve (iii.a) clear signatures of some kind of partial transport barriers and\nconjecture (iii.b) a stochastic process with an effective drift along resonance\nchannels. These two processes lay the basis for a future understanding of the\nmechanism of power-law trapping in higher-dimensional systems.\n", "  We present a method for precisely measuring the tunnel splitting in\nsingle-molecule magnets using electron-spin resonance, and use these\nmeasurements to precisely and independently determine the underlying transverse\nanisotropy parameter, given a certain class of transitions. By diluting samples\nof the SMM Ni$_4$ via co-crystallization in a diamagnetic isostructural\nanalogue we obtain markedly narrower resonance peaks than are observed in\nundiluted samples. Using custom loop-gap resonators we measure the transitions\nat several frequencies, allowing a precise determination of the tunnel\nsplitting. Because the transition under investigation occurs at zero field, and\narises due to a first-order perturbation from the transverse anisotropy, we can\ndetermine the magnitude of this anisotropy independent of any other Hamiltonian\nparameters. This method can be applied to other SMMs with tunnel splittings\narising from first-order transverse anisotropy perturbations.\n", "  The type-II Weyl and type-II Dirac fermions may emerge behind the event\nhorizon of black holes. Correspondingly the black hole can be simulated by\ncreation of the region with overtilted Weyl or Dirac cones. The filling of the\nelectronic states inside the \"black hole\" is accompanied by Hawking radiation.\nThe Hawking temperature in the Weyl semimetals can reach the room temperature,\nif the black hole region is sufficiently small, and thus the effective gravity\nat the horizon is large.\n", "  The potential energy landscape (PEL) formalism is a valuable approach within\nstatistical mechanics for describing supercooled liquids and glasses. Here we\nuse the PEL formalism and computer simulations to study the pressure-induced\ntransformations between low-density amorphous ice (LDA) and high-density\namorphous ice (HDA) at different temperatures. We employ the ST2 water model\nfor which the LDA-HDA transformations are remarkably sharp, similar to what is\nobserved in experiments, and reminiscent of a first-order phase transition. Our\nresults are consistent with the view that LDA and HDA configurations are\nassociated with two distinct regions (megabasins) of the PEL that are separated\nby a potential energy barrier. At higher temperature, we find that low-density\nliquid (LDL) configurations are located in the same megabasin as LDA, and that\nhigh-density liquid (HDL) configurations are located in the same megabasin as\nHDA. We show that the pressure-induced LDL-HDL and LDA-HDA transformations\noccur along paths that interconnect these two megabasins, but that the path\nfollowed by the liquid is different than the path followed by the amorphous\nsolid. At higher pressure, we also study the liquid-to-ice-VII first-order\nphase transition, and find that the behavior of the PEL properties across this\ntransition are qualitatively similar to the changes found during the LDA-HDA\ntransformation. This similarity supports the interpretation that the LDA-HDA\ntransformation is a first-order-like phase transition between\nout-of-equilibrium states.\n", "  Random local measurements have recently been proposed to construct\nentanglement witnesses and thereby detect the presence of bipartite\nentanglement. We experimentally demonstrate the efficacy of one such scheme on\na two-qubit NMR quantum information processor. We show that a set of three\nrandom local measurements suffices to detect the entanglement of a general\ntwo-qubit state. We experimentally generate states with different amounts of\nentanglement, and show that the scheme is able to clearly witness entanglement.\nWe perform complete quantum state tomography for each state and compute state\nfidelity to validate our results. Further, we extend previous results and\nperform a simulation using random local measurements to optimally detect\nbipartite entanglement in a hybrid system of $2\\otimes 3$ dimensionality.\n", "  The exploring and understanding the electronic properties of molecules\nconnected to metallic leads is a vital part of nanoscience if molecule is to\nhave a future. This thesis documents a study for various families of organic\nand organometallic molecules, which offer unique concepts and new insights into\nthe electronic properties of molecular junctions. Different families of\nmolecules were studied using a combination of density functional theory DFT and\nnonequilibrium Greens function formalism of transport theory.The main results\nof this thesis are as follows. A quantum circuit rule for combining quantum\ninterference effects in the conductive properties of oligo phenyleneethynylene\nOPE type molecules possessing three aromatic rings was investigated both\ntheoretically and experimentally. The theoretical and experimental studies of\nconductance and the decay of conductance as a function of molecular length\nwithin a homologous series of oligoynes. The single molecule conductances of a\nseries of bis-terpyridine complexes featuring Ru, Fe, and Co metal ions and\ntrimethylsilylethynyl or thiomethyl surface contact groups have been determined\ntheoretically and experimentally.\n", "  Based upon Maxwell's equations, it has long been established that oscillating\nelectromagnetic (EM) fields incident upon a metal surface decay exponentially\ninside the conductor, leading to a virtual EM vacuum at sufficient depths.\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) utilizes radiofrequency (r.f.) EM fields to\nproduce images. Here we present the first visualization of an EM vacuum inside\na bulk metal strip by MRI, amongst several novel findings.\n  We uncover unexpected MRI intensity patterns arising from two orthogonal\npairs of faces of a metal strip, and derive formulae for their intensity\nratios, revealing differing effective elemental volumes (voxels) underneath\nthese faces.\n  Further, we furnish chemical shift imaging (CSI) results that discriminate\ndifferent faces (surfaces) of a metal block according to their distinct nuclear\nmagnetic resonance (NMR) chemical shifts, which holds much promise for\nmonitoring surface chemical reactions noninvasively.\n  Bulk metals are ubiquitous, and MRI is a premier noninvasive diagnostic tool.\nCombining the two, the emerging field of bulk metal MRI can be expected to grow\nin importance. The fundamental nature of results presented here may impactbulk\nmetal MRI and CSI across many fields.\n", "  Using a fully analytical theory, we compute the leading order corrections to\nthe translational, rotational and translation-rotation coupling mobilities of\nan arbitrary axisymmetric particle immersed in a Newtonian fluid moving near an\nelastic cell membrane that exhibits resistance towards stretching and bending.\nThe frequency-dependent mobility corrections are expressed as general relations\ninvolving separately the particle's shape-dependent bulk mobility and the\nshape-independent parameters such as the membrane-particle distance, the\nparticle orientation and the characteristic frequencies associated with\nshearing and bending of the membrane. This makes the equations applicable to an\narbitrary-shaped axisymmetric particle provided that its bulk mobilities are\nknown, either analytically or numerically. For a spheroidal particle, these\ngeneral relations reduce to simple expressions in terms of the particle's\neccentricity. We find that the corrections to the translation-rotation coupling\nmobility are primarily determined by bending, whereas shearing manifests itself\nin a more pronounced way in the rotational mobility. We demonstrate the\nvalidity of the analytical approximations by a detailed comparison with\nboundary integral simulations of a truly extended spheroidal particle. They are\nfound to be in a good agreement over the whole range of applied frequencies.\n", "  We report on a superoutburst of a WZ Sge-type dwarf nova (DN), ASASSN-15po.\nThe light curve showed the main superoutburst and multiple rebrightenings. In\nthis outburst, we observed early superhumps and growing (stage A) superhumps\nwith periods of 0.050454(2) and 0.051809(13) d, respectively. We estimated that\nthe mass ratio of secondary to primary ($q$) is 0.0699(8) by using $P_{\\rm\norb}$ and a superhump period $P_{\\rm SH}$ of stage A. ASASSN-15po [$P_{\\rm orb}\n\\sim$ 72.6 min] is the first DN with the orbital period between 67--76 min.\nAlthough the theoretical predicted period minimum $P_{\\rm min}$ of\nhydrogen-rich cataclysmic variables (CVs) is about 65--70 min, the\nobservational cut-off of the orbital period distribution at 80 min implies that\nthe period minimum is about 82 min, and the value is widely accepted. We\nsuggest the following four possibilities: the object is (1) a theoretical\nperiod minimum object (2) a binary with a evolved secondary (3) a binary with a\nmetal-poor (Popullation II) seconday (4) a binary which was born with a\nbrown-dwarf donor below the period minimum.\n", "  We study the creation and evolution of cosmological perturbations in\nrenormalizable quadratic gravity with a Weyl term. We adopt a prescription that\nimplies the stability of the vacuum at the price of introducing a massive\nspin-two ghost state, leading to the loss of unitarity. The theory may still be\npredictive regardless the interpretation of non-unitary processes provided that\ntheir rate is negligible compared to the Universe expansion rate. This implies\nthat the ghost is effectively stable. In such a setup, there are two scalar\ndegrees of freedom excited during inflation. The first one is the usual\ncurvature perturbation whose power spectrum appears to coincide with that of\nsingle-field inflation. The second one is a scalar component of the ghost\nencoded in the shift vector of the metric in the uniform inflaton gauge. The\namplitudes of primordial tensor and vector perturbations are strongly\nsuppressed. After inflation the ghost field starts to oscillate and its energy\ndensity shortly becomes dominant in the Universe. For all ghost masses allowed\nby laboratory constraints ghosts should have \"overclosed\" the Universe at\ntemperatures higher than that of primordial nucleosynthesis. Thus, the model\nwith the light Weyl ghost is ruled out.\n", "  A novel hydraulic fracture (HF) formulation is introduced which accounts for\nthe hydraulically induced shear stress at the crack faces. It utilizes a\ngeneral form of the elasticity operator alongside a revised fracture\npropagation condition based on the critical value of the energy release rate.\nIt is shown that the revised formulation describes the underlying physics of HF\nin a more accurate way and is in agreement with the asymptotic behaviour of the\nlinear elastic fracture mechanics. A number of numerical simulations by means\nof the universal HF algorithm previously developed in Wrobel & Mishuris (2015)\nare performed in order to: i) compare the modified HF formulation with its\nclassic counterpart and ii) investigate the peculiarities of the former.\nComputational advantages of the revised HF model are demonstrated. Asymptotic\nestimations of the main solution elements are provided for the cases of small\nand large toughness. The modified formulation opens new ways to analyse the\nphysical phenomenon of HF and also improves the reliability and efficiency of\nits numerical simulations.\n", "  We present the serendipitous ALMA detection of a faint submillimeter galaxy\n(SMG) lensed by a foreground z~1 galaxy. By optimizing the source detection to\ndeblend the system, we accurately build the full spectral energy distribution\nof the distant galaxy from the I814 band to radio wavelengths. It is extremely\nred, with a I-K colour larger than 2.5. We estimate a photometric redshift of\n3.28 and determine the physical parameters. The distant galaxy turns out to be\nmagnified by the foreground lens by a factor of ~1.5, which implies an\nintrinsic Ks-band magnitude of ~24.5, a submillimeter flux at 870um of ~2.5 mJy\nand a SFR of ~150-300Msun/yr, depending on the adopted tracer. These values\nplace our source towards the faint end of the distribution of observed SMGs,\nand in particular among the still few faint SMGs with a fully characterized\nspectral energy distribution, which allows us not only to accurately estimate\nits redshift but also to measure its stellar mass and other physical\nproperties. The galaxy studied in this work is a representative of the\npopulation of faint SMGs, of which only few objects are known to date, that are\nundetected in optical and therefore are not typically accounted for when\nmeasuring the cosmic star formation history (SFH). This faint galaxy population\nthus likely represents an important and missing piece in our understanding of\nthe cosmic SFH. Its observation and characterization is of major importance to\nachieve a solid picture of galaxy evolution.\n", "  Optical beam shifts from a free-standing two-dimensional atomic crystal are\ninvestigated. In contrast to a three-dimensional crystal the magnitude of the\nGoos-H$\\rm \\ddot{a}$nchen shift depends on the surface susceptibility of the\ncrystal and not on the wavelength of the incident light beam. The surface\nconductivity of the atomically thin crystal is less important in this context\nbecause it enters in the expression of the shifts only as a second order\nparameter. In analogy to a three-dimensional crystal the magnitudes of the\nImbert-Fedorov shift and of the angular shifts depend respectively on the\nwavelength and on the square of the beam angular aperture.\n", "  We measure a combination of gravitational lensing, galaxy clustering, and\nredshift-space distortions called $E_G$. The quantity $E_G$ probes both parts\nof metric potential and is insensitive to galaxy bias and $\\sigma_8$. These\nproperties make it an attractive statistic to test $\\Lambda$CDM, General\nRelativity and its alternate theories. We have combined CMASS DR11 with\nCFHTLenS and recent measurements of $\\beta$ from RSD analysis, and find $E_G(z\n= 0.57) = 0.42 \\pm 0.056$, an 13\\% measurement in agreement with the prediction\nof general relativity $E_G(z = 0.57) = 0.396 \\pm 0.011$ using the Planck 2015\ncosmological parameters. We have corrected our measurement for various\nobservational and theoretical systematics. Our measurement is consistent with\nthe first measurement of $E_G$ using CMB lensing in place of galaxy lensing\n(Pullen et. al. 2015a) at small scales, but shows 2.8$\\sigma$ tension when\ncompared with their final results including large scales. This analysis with\nfuture surveys will provide improved statistical error and better control over\nsystematics to test General Relativity and its alternate theories.\n", "  Shibata & Yokoyama (1999, 2002) proposed a method of estimating the coronal\nmagnetic field strengths ($B$) and magnetic loop lengths ($L$) of solar and\nstellar flares, on the basis of magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the magnetic\nreconnection model. Using the scaling law provided by Shibata & Yokoyama (1999,\n2002), $B$ and $L$ are obtained as functions of the emission measure\n($EM=n^2L^3$) and temperature ($T$) at the flare peak. Here, $n$ is the coronal\nelectron density of the flares. This scaling law enables the estimation of $B$\nand $L$ for unresolved stellar flares from the observable physical quantities\n$EM$ and $T$, which is helpful for studying stellar surface activities. To\napply this scaling law to stellar flares, we discuss its validity for spatially\nresolved solar flares. $EM$ and $T$ were calculated from GOES soft X-ray flux\ndata, and $B$ and $L$ are theoretically estimated using the scaling law. For\nthe same flare events, $B$ and $L$ were also observationally estimated with\nimages taken by Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)/ Helioseismic and Magnetic\nImager (HMI) Magnetogram and Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) 94{\\AA} pass\nband. As expected, a positive correlation was found between the theoretically\nand observationally estimated values. We interpret this result as indirect\nevidence that flares are caused by magnetic reconnection. Moreover, this\nanalysis makes us confident in the validity of applying this scaling law to\nstellar flares as well as solar flares.\n", "  Very recently quasi two-dimensional (2D) systems made of attractive fermionic\nalkali-metal atoms with a widely tunable interaction due to Fano-Feshbach\nresonances have been realized. In this way it has been achieved the 2D\ncrossover from the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer regime of weakly-interacting\nCooper pairs to the Bose-Einstein condensate regime strongly bound dimers.\nThese experiments pave the way to the investigation of 2D strongly-interacting\nattractive fermions during the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition\nfrom a low-temperature superfluid phase characterized by quasi-condensation to\na high-temperature normal phase, where vortex proliferation driven by quantum\nand thermal fluctuations completely destroys superfluidity. In this paper we\ndiscuss our preliminar theoretical results on the behavior of the BKT critical\ntemperature across the crossover. Our microscopic calculations are based on\nfunctional integration taking into account renormalized Gaussian fluctuations\nand the crucial 2D effect of vortex-antivortex unbinding.\n", "  The chemical potential of the two-site Hubbard cluster (pair) embedded in the\nexternal electric and magnetic fields is studied by exact diagonalization of\nthe Hamiltonian. The formalism of the grand canonical ensemble is adopted. The\ninfluence of temperature, Hubbard on-site Coulombic energy $U$ and electron\nconcentration on the chemical potential is investigated and illustrated in\nfigures. In particular, a discontinuous behaviour of the chemical potential (or\nelectron concentration) in the ground state is discussed.\n", "  Isoscalar density is a sum of neutron and proton densities and isovector is a\nnormalized difference. Here, we report on the experimental evidence for the\ndisplacement of the isovector and isoscalar surfaces in nuclei, by $\\sim$$0.9\n\\, \\text{fm}$ from each other. We analyze data on quasielastic (QE) charge\nexchange (p,n) reactions, concurrently with proton and neutron elastic\nscattering data for the same target nuclei, following the concepts of the\nisoscalar and isovector potentials combined into Lane optical potential. The\nelastic data largely probe the geometry of the isoscalar potential and the\n(p,n) data largely probe a relation between the geometries of the isovector and\nisoscalar potentials. The targets include $^{48}$Ca, $^{90}$Zr, $^{120}$Sn and\n$^{208}$Pb and projectile incident energy values span the range of\n(10-50)$\\,\\text{MeV}$. In our fit to elastic and QE charge-exchange data, we\nallow the values of isoscalar and isovector radii, diffusivities and overall\npotential normalizations to float away from those in the popular Koning and\nDelaroche parametrization. We find that the best-fit isovector radii are\nconsistently larger than isoscalar and the best-fit isovector surfaces are\nsteeper. Upon identifying the displacement of the potential surfaces with the\ndisplacement of the surfaces for the densities in the Skyrme-Hartree-Fock\ncalculations, and by supplementing the results with those from analysing\nexcitation energies to isobaric analog states in the past, we arrive at the\nslope and value of the symmetry energy at normal density of $70<L<101\\,\n\\text{MeV}$ and $33.5<a_a^V<36.4\\, \\text{MeV}$, respectively.\n", "  A variety of fundamental astrophysical science topics require the\ndetermination of very accurate photometric redshifts (photo-z's). A wide\nplethora of methods have been developed, based either on template models\nfitting or on empirical explorations of the photometric parameter space.\nMachine learning based techniques are not explicitly dependent on the physical\npriors and able to produce accurate photo-z estimations within the photometric\nranges derived from the spectroscopic training set. These estimates, however,\nare not easy to characterize in terms of a photo-z Probability Density Function\n(PDF), due to the fact that the analytical relation mapping the photometric\nparameters onto the redshift space is virtually unknown. We present METAPHOR\n(Machine-learning Estimation Tool for Accurate PHOtometric Redshifts), a method\ndesigned to provide a reliable PDF of the error distribution for empirical\ntechniques. The method is implemented as a modular workflow, whose internal\nengine for photo-z estimation makes use of the MLPQNA neural network (Multi\nLayer Perceptron with Quasi Newton learning rule), with the possibility to\neasily replace the specific machine learning model chosen to predict photo-z's.\nWe present a summary of results on SDSS-DR9 galaxy data, used also to perform a\ndirect comparison with PDF's obtained by the Le Phare SED template fitting. We\nshow that METAPHOR is capable to estimate the precision and reliability of\nphotometric redshifts obtained with three different self-adaptive techniques,\ni.e. MLPQNA, Random Forest and the standard K-Nearest Neighbors models.\n", "  Based on PYTHIA6.428, event-by-event fluctuations of the mean transverse\nmomentum in proton- proton collisions at sqrt_s = 7 TeV are studied using\nseveral measures of the fluctuations. The study compares results of the\nfluctuations for events where color reconnection is turned on, with those where\ncolor reconnection is turned off. The comparison reveals that some of the\nfluctuation measures are much more sensitive to color reconnection than others.\nThrough the comparison it is demonstrated for the first time that for\nproton-proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider, these sensitive measures\nof the mean transverse momentum fluctuations can serve as alternative probes to\ncolor reconnection and color reconnection is a non-trivial source of the\nevent-by-event fluctuations.\n", "  In bipartite quantum systems, entanglement correlations between the parties\nexerts direct influence in the phenomenon of wave-particle duality. This effect\nhas been quantitatively analyzed in the context of two qubits by M. Jakob and\nJ. Bergou [Optics Communications 283(5) (2010) 827]. Employing a description of\nthe $K$-meson propagation in free space where its weak decay states are\nincluded as a second party, we study here this effect in the kaon-antikaon\noscillations. We show that a new quantitative \"triality\" relation holds,\nsimilar to the one considered by Jakob and Bergou. In our case, it relates the\ndistinguishability between the decay products states corresponding to the\ndistinct kaon propagation modes $K_S $, $K_L $, the amount of wave-like path\ninterference between these states, and the amount of entanglement given by the\nreduced von Neumann entropy. The inequality can account for the complementarity\nbetween strangeness oscillations and lifetime information previously considered\nin the literature, therefore allowing one to see how it is affected by\nentanglement correlations. As we will discuss, it allows one to visualize\nclearly through the $K^{0}$$\\overline{K}\\,^{0}$ oscillations the fundamental\nrole of entanglement in quantum complementarity.\n", "  We derive and study an approximate static vacuum solution generated by a\npoint-like source in a higher derivative gravitational theory with a pair of\ncomplex conjugate ghosts. The gravitational theory is local and characterized\nby a high derivative operator compatible with Lee-Wick unitarity. In\nparticular, the tree-level two-point function only shows a pair of complex\nconjugate poles besides the massless spin two graviton. We show that\nsingularity-free black holes exist when the mass of the source $M$ exceeds a\ncritical value $M_{\\rm crit}$. For $M > M_{\\rm crit}$ the spacetime structure\nis characterized by an outer event horizon and an inner Cauchy horizon, while\nfor $M = M_{\\rm crit}$ we have an extremal black hole with vanishing Hawking\ntemperature. The evaporation process leads to a remnant that approaches the\nzero-temperature extremal black hole state in an infinite amount of time.\n", "  The Schwinger pairs production rate is calculated numerically in the\nsoft-wall model with the help of a simpler method in determining the\nsoft-wall's position beyond which probe strings connecting the Schwinger pairs\ndo not fall into. Behaviours of the production rate in both the upper critical\nregion and the middle linear part are studied carefully. The latter exhibits\ninteresting new features un-noted previously. All results are presented in\ncomparisons with hard-wall models.\n", "  Extracting energy from fluctuations has been an everlasting endeavor. An\nimportant strategy is to use information-based operation, which allows energy\nextraction even from thermal fluctuations. However, it remains unclear whether\na blind external operation, ignorant of such fluctuations, will also work.\nAssuming such a small operation, we find that energy extraction requires a\nnegative response spectrum in a certain frequency region, which inevitably\nrequires an internal power source to maintain. Energy is then extracted by\noperating the system at these frequencies. Negative response is intrinsic to\nany system that adapts to a slow external operation, which could be realized\nthrough integral feedback control. These are demonstrated through a solvable\nmodel.\n", "  The present work shows that the mathematical equivalence of Jordan frame and\nits conformally transformed version, the Einstein frame, so far as Brans-Dicke\ntheory is concerned, survives a quantization of cosmological models in the\ntheory. We work with the Wheeler-deWitt quantization scheme and take up quite a\nfew anisotropic cosmological models as examples. We effectively show that the\ntransformation from Jordan to Einstein frame is a canonical one and hence two\nframes are equivalent description of same physical scenario.\n", "  In this paper, gravitational lensing scenario due to the R-charged black hole\nof five dimensional supergravity investigated. We study the effective potential\nof traveling photons near the R-charged black hole and find some stable orbits\nfor the photons. We also find that the effect of the black hole charges is\nincreasing of the effective potential. We have shown that photons do not cross\nthe horizon of the very large R-charged black hole. By using the numerical\nstudy we find that the black hole charges and non-extremality parameter\ndecrease value of the deflection angle.\n", "  An analytical method for investigation of the evolution of dynamical systems\n{\\it with independent on time accuracy} is developed for perturbed Hamiltonian\nsystems. The error-free estimation using of computer algebra enables the\napplication of the method to complex multi-dimensional Hamiltonian and\ndissipative systems. It also opens principal opportunities for the qualitative\nstudy of chaotic trajectories. The performance of the method is demonstrated on\nperturbed two-oscillator systems. It can be applied to various non-linear\nphysical and astrophysical systems, e.g. to the long-term planetary dynamics.\n", "  Meandering instability is familiar to everyone through river meandering or\nsmall rivulets of rain flowing down a windshield. However, its physical\nunderstanding is still premature, although it could inspire researchers in\nvarious fields, such as nonlinear science, fluid mechanics and geophysics, to\nresolve their long-standing problems. Here, we perform a small-scale experiment\nin which air flow is created in a thin granular bed to successfully find a\nmeandering regime, together with other remarkable fluidized regimes, such as a\nturbulent regime. We discover that phase diagrams of the flow regimes for\ndifferent types of grains can be universally presented as functions of the flow\nrate and the granular-bed thickness when the two quantities are properly\nrenormalized. We further reveal that the meandering shapes are self-similar as\nwas shown for meandering rivers. The experimental findings are explained by\ntheory, with elucidating the physics. The theory is based on force balance, a\nminimum-dissipation principle, and a linear-instability analysis of a continuum\nequation that takes into account the fluid-solid duality, i.e., the existence\nof fluidized and solidified regions of grains along the meandering path. The\npresent results provide fruitful links to related issues in various fields,\nincluding fluidized bed reactors in industry.\n", "  Super-resolution microscopy is providing unprecedented insights into biology\nby resolving details much below the diffraction limit. State-of-the-art Single\nMolecule Localization Microscopy (SMLM) techniques for super-resolution are\nrestricted by long acquisition and computational times, or the need of special\nfluorophores or chemical environments. Here, we propose a novel statistical\nsuper-resolution technique of wide-field fluorescence microscopy called\nMUltiple SIgnal Classification ALgorithm (MUSICAL) which has several advantages\nover SMLM techniques. MUSICAL provides resolution down to at least 50 nm, has\nlow requirements on number of frames and excitation power and works even at\nhigh fluorophore concentrations. Further, it works with any fluorophore that\nexhibits blinking on the time scale of the recording. We compare imaging\nresults of MUSICAL with SMLM and four contemporary statistical super-resolution\nmethods for experiments of in-vitro actin filaments and datasets provided by\nindependent research groups. Results show comparable or superior performance of\nMUSICAL. We also demonstrate super-resolution at time scales of 245 ms (using\n49 frames at acquisition rate of 200 frames per second) in samples of live-cell\nmicrotubules and live-cell actin filaments.\n", "  The High Energy cosmic Radiation Detection (HERD) facility is a space mission\ndesigned for detecting cosmic ray (CR) electrons, $\\gamma$-rays up to tens of\nTeV and CR nuclei from proton to iron up to several PeV. The main instrument of\nHERD is a 3-D imaging calorimeter (CALO) composed of nearly ten thousand cubic\nLYSO crystals. A large dynamic range of single HERD CALO Cell (HCC) is\nnecessary to achieve HERD's PeV observation objectives, which means that the\nresponse of HCC should maintain a good linearity from minimum ionizing particle\n(MIP) calibration to PeV shower maximum. In order to study the linearity of HCC\nover such a large energy range, a beam test has been implemented at the E2 and\nE3 beam lines of BEPC. High intensity pulsed electron beam provided by E2 line\nare used for producing high energy density within HCC; $\\pi^{+}$/proton\nprovided by E3 line are used for HCC calibration. The results show that no\nsaturation effect occurs and the linearity of HCC is better than 10% from 30\nMeV (1 MIP) to 1.1$\\times$10$^{3}$ TeV (energy density is 93 TeV/cm$^{3}$),\nwhich can meet the requirement mentioned above.\n", "  In the long-term multi-frequency monitoring program of the microquasars with\nRATAN-600 we discovered the giant flare from the X-ray binary Cygnus X-3 on 13\nSeptember 2016. It happened after 2000 days of the 'quiescent state' of the\nsource passed after the former giant flare (~18 Jy) in March 2011. We have\nfound that during this quiet period the hard X-ray flux (Swift/BAT, 15-50 keV)\nand radio flux (RATAN-600, 11 GHz) have been strongly anti-correlated. Both\nradio flares occurred after transitions of the microquasar to a 'hypersoft'\nX-ray state that occurred in February 2011 and in the end of August 2016. The\ngiant flare was predicted by us in the first ATel #9416. Indeed after dramatic\ndecrease of the hard X-ray Swift 15-50 keV flux and RATAN 4-11 GHz fluxes (a\n'quenched state') a small flare (0.7 Jy at 4-11 GHz) developed on MJD 57632 and\nthen on MJD 57644.5 almost simultaneously with X-rays radio flux rose from 0.01\nto 15 Jy at 4.6 GHz during few days. The rise of the flaring flux is well\nfitted by a exponential law that could be a initial phase of the relativistic\nelectrons generation by internal shock waves in the jets. Initially spectra\nwere optically thick at frequencies lower 2 GHz and optically thin at\nfrequencies higher 8 GHz with typical spectral index about -0.5. After maximum\nof the flare radio fluxes at all frequencies faded out with the exponential law\n(~ exp(-(t-t0)/2d) for 21.7 GHz).\n", "  Carbon Dioxide (CO2) is one of the most important greenhouse gases after\nwater vapor (H2O) which plays significant role in the climate process. Accurate\nspace-based measurement of CO2 is of great significance in inferring the\nlocation of CO2 sources and sinks. Uncertainties in greenhouse gases (GHG)\nretrieval process must be minimized to accurately infer the actual amount of\nthe atmospheric species. Clouds pose a large uncertainty in CO2 space-based\nretrieval process leading, mostly, to an underestimation in the CO2 absorption\namount above the cloud layer provided that photons do not perform multiple\npaths. In this paper, three different cases of data collected over cloudy and\nclear skies by Argus 1000 micro-spectrometer were analyzed. Findings show that\nthe CO2 absorption in the absence of clouds is approximately 4.5% higher than\nwhen clouds are present.\n", "  An electron mobility enhancement is the very important phenomenon of an\nelectron in the electronic device, where the high electronic device performance\nhas the good electron mobility, which is obtained by the overall electron drift\nvelocity in the electronic material driven potential difference. The increasing\nin electron mobility by the injected high group velocity pulse is proposed in\nthis article. By using light pulse input into the nonlinear microring\nresonator, light pulse group velocity can be tuned and increased, from which\nthe required output group velocity can be obtained, which can be used to drive\nelectron within the plasmonic waveguide, where eventually, the relative\nelectron mobility can be obtained, the increasing in the electron mobility\nafter adding up by the driven optical fields can be connected to the external\nelectronic devices and circuits, which can be useful for many applications.\n", "  We measured the chromospheric activity of the four hot Jupiter hosts WASP-43,\nWASP-51/HAT-P-30, WASP-72 & WASP-103 to search for anomalous values caused by\nthe close-in companions. The Mount Wilson Ca II H&K S-index was calculated for\neach star using observations taken with the Robert Stobie Spectrograph at the\nSouthern African Large Telescope. The activity level of WASP-43 is anomalously\nhigh relative to its age and falls among the highest values of all known main\nsequence stars. We found marginal evidence that the activity of WASP-103 is\nalso higher than expected from the system age. We suggest that for WASP-43 and\nWASP-103 star-planet interactions (SPI) may enhance the Ca II H&K core\nemission. The activity levels of WASP-51/HAT-P-30 and WASP-72 are anomalously\nlow, with the latter falling below the basal envelope for both main sequence\nand evolved stars. This can be attributed to circumstellar absorption due to\nplanetary mass loss, though absorption in the ISM may contribute. A quarter of\nknown short period planet hosts exhibit anomalously low activity levels,\nincluding systems with hot Jupiters and low mass companions. Since SPI can\nelevate and absorption can suppress the observed chromospheric activity of\nstars with close-in planets, their Ca II H&K activity levels are an unreliable\nage indicator. Systems where the activity is depressed by absorption from\nplanetary mass loss are key targets for examining planet compositions through\ntransmission spectroscopy.\n", "  In the bootstrap approach to integrable quantum field theories in the\n(1+1)-dimensional Minkowski space, one conjectures the two-particle S-matrix\nand tries to study local observables. The massless sine-Gordon model is\nconjectured to be equivalent to the Thirring model, and its breather-breather\nS-matrix components (where the first breather corresponds to the scalar field\nof the sine-Gordon model) are closed under fusion. Yet, the residues of the\npoles in this breather-breather S-matrix have wrong signs and cannot be\nconsidered as a separate model. We find CDD factors which adjust the signs, so\nthat the breather-breather S-matrix alone satisfies reasonable assumptions.\nThen we propose candidates for observables in wedge-shaped regions and prove\ntheir commutativity in the weak sense.\n", "  Photometric redshifts (photo-z's) are fundamental in galaxy surveys to\naddress different topics, from gravitational lensing and dark matter\ndistribution to galaxy evolution. The Kilo Degree Survey (KiDS), i.e. the ESO\npublic survey on the VLT Survey Telescope (VST), provides the unprecedented\nopportunity to exploit a large galaxy dataset with an exceptional image quality\nand depth in the optical wavebands. Using a KiDS subset of about 25,000\ngalaxies with measured spectroscopic redshifts, we have derived photo-z's using\ni) three different empirical methods based on supervised machine learning, ii)\nthe Bayesian Photometric Redshift model (or BPZ), and iii) a classical SED\ntemplate fitting procedure (Le Phare). We confirm that, in the regions of the\nphotometric parameter space properly sampled by the spectroscopic templates,\nmachine learning methods provide better redshift estimates, with a lower\nscatter and a smaller fraction of outliers. SED fitting techniques, however,\nprovide useful information on the galaxy spectral type which can be effectively\nused to constrain systematic errors and to better characterize potential\ncatastrophic outliers. Such classification is then used to specialize the\ntraining of regression machine learning models, by demonstrating that a hybrid\napproach, involving SED fitting and machine learning in a single collaborative\nframework, can be effectively used to improve the accuracy of photo-z\nestimates.\n", "  In this work, we study the dynamics of an atomic harmonically trapped\nlarge-spin Fermi gas in one dimension (1D). We investigate the interplay of\ndifferent collision processes. Coherent spin oscillations, driven by\nspin-changing forward scattering are captured by a mean-field description and\nscale linearly with density regardless of the dimension of the system.\nConversely, \"incoherent\" collision processes which e.g. lead to the damping of\nspin oscillations, behave differently. In the usual three-dimensional (3D)\ncase, the rate of incoherent processes increases faster with density than\nmean-field effects, but in 1D it increases slower. This means, that in the 1D\ncase, incoherent collisions become more important at lower densities. We study\nthese effects by deriving and integrating a quantum Boltzmann equation. We\ndemonstrate that the well known fact that in one dimension, interaction-induced\ncorrelations become more dominant at low densities can be observed in\nfar-from-equilibrium spin dynamics.\n", "  Developments in metamaterials and related structures such as metasurfaces\nhave opened up new possibilities in designing materials and devices with unique\nproperties. The main progress related to electromagnetic waves applications was\ndone in optical and microwave spectra. Here we report about a new hybrid\nmetasurface structure, comprising a two-dimensional metamaterial surface and a\nvery high permittivity dielectric substrate that was designed to enhance the\nperformance of an ultra-high field MRI scanner. This new flexible and compact\nresonant structure is the first one which can be integrated into a\nmulti-element close-fitting receive coil array used for all clinical MRI. We\nsuccessfully demonstrated the operation of the metasurface in acquiring vivo\nhuman brain images and spectra with enhanced local sensitivity on a commercial\n7 Tesla system. These experimental findings prove the feasibility of real\nclinical applications of metasurfaces in MRI.\n", "  The paper describes a time-resolved photoemission (TRPES) apparatus equipped\nwith a Yb-doped fiber laser system delivering 1.2-eV pump and 5.9-eV probe\npulses at the repetition rate of 95 MHz. Time and energy resolutions are 11.3\nmeV and ~310 fs, respectively; the latter is estimated by performing TRPES on a\nhighly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG). The high repetition rate is suited\nfor achieving high signal-to-noise ratio in TRPES spectra, thereby facilitating\ninvestigations of ultrafast electronic dynamics in the low pump fluence (p)\nregion. TRPES of polycrystalline bismuth (Bi) at p as low as 30 nJ/mm2 is\ndemonstrated. The laser source is compact and is docked to an existing TRPES\napparatus based on a 250-kHz Ti:sapphire laser system. The 95-MHz system is\nless prone to space-charge broadening effects compared to the 250-kHz system,\nwhich we explicitly show in a systematic probe-power dependency of the Fermi\ncutoff of polycrystalline gold. We also describe that the TRPES response of an\noriented Bi(111)/HOPG sample is useful for fine-tuning the spatial overlap of\nthe pump and probe beams even when p is as low as 30 nJ/mm2.\n", "  ZrMnP and HfMnP single crystals are grown by a self-flux growth technique and\nstructural as well as temperature dependent magnetic and transport properties\nare studied. Both compounds have an orthorhombic crystal structure. ZrMnP and\nHfMnP are ferromagnetic with Curie temperatures around $370$~K and $320$~K\nrespectively. The spontaneous magnetizations of ZrMnP and HfMnP are determined\nto be $1.9$~$\\mu_\\textrm{B}$/f.u. and $2.1$~$\\mu_\\textrm{B}$/f.u. respectively\nat $50$~K. The magnetocaloric effect of ZrMnP in term of entropy change\n($\\Delta S$) is estimated to be $-6.7$ kJm$^{-3}$K$^{-1}$ around $369$~K. The\neasy axis of magnetization is [100] for both compounds, with a small anisotropy\nrelative to the [010] axis. At $50$~K, the anisotropy field along the [001]\naxis is $\\sim4.6$~T for ZrMnP and $\\sim10$~T for HfMnP. Such large magnetic\nanisotropy is remarkable considering the absence of rare-earth elements in\nthese compounds. The first principle calculation correctly predicts the\nmagnetization and hard axis orientation for both compounds, and predicts the\nexperimental HfMnP anisotropy field within 25 percent. More importantly, our\ncalculations suggest that the large magnetic anisotropy comes primarily from\nthe Mn atoms suggesting that similarly large anisotropies may be found in other\n3d transition metal compounds.\n", "  The formation mechanisms and chemical compositions of brown dwarfs likely\nspan a diverse range. If they are formed predominantly in isolation by\ngravitational collapse like dwarf stars then their compositions might follow\nthose of dwarf stars, spanning a relatively narrow range in metallicities (~\n-0.4 to +0.4 dex) and predominantly oxygen-rich (C/O <~ 0.7). On the other\nhand, giant planets in the solar system are all super-solar in metallicity\n([C/H] > 0.5~dex), which is thought to be a consequence of formation by\ncore-accretion in a circumstellar disk. In this study we determine the\natmospheric chemical compositions of three brown dwarfs and find them to be\nneither characteristic of dwarf stars nor giant planets. We derive\nhigh-precision atmospheric chemical abundances using high-S/N HST near-infrared\nspectra of three mid T Dwarfs which, together with two previously studied\nobjects, display distinctly sub-solar metallicities and span C/O ratios of\n0.4-1.0. These abundance patterns indicate either an old sub-stellar population\nand a multitude of formation environments or objects formed in circumstellar\ndisks followed by ejection later. We show that for a simple synthetic model\npopulation of brown dwarfs with the same spectral-type as our sample the\npredicted age distribution is predominantly older than the Sun and, hence, more\nmetal poor, consistent with our derived abundances. The diverse C/O ratios we\nfind are indicative of either different chemical reservoirs in their formation\nenvironments or different formation pathways. Our results open the possibility\nthat cool brown dwarfs may provide important probes of early galactic chemical\nevolution and inhomogeneity.\n", "  I give a short commentary on a seminal article by T W B Kibble in 1976,\n\"Topology of cosmic domains and strings\".\n", "  The discovery of physical laws consistent with empirical observations lies at\nthe heart of (applied) science and engineering. These laws typically take the\nform of nonlinear differential equations depending on parameters, dynamical\nsystems theory provides, through the appropriate normal forms, an \"intrinsic\",\nprototypical characterization of the types of dynamical regimes accessible to a\ngiven model. Using an implementation of data-informed geometry learning we\ndirectly reconstruct the relevant \"normal forms\": a quantitative mapping from\nempirical observations to prototypical realizations of the underlying dynamics.\nInterestingly, the state variables and the parameters of these realizations are\ninferred from the empirical observations, without prior knowledge or\nunderstanding, they parametrize the dynamics {\\em intrinsically}, without\nexplicit reference to fundamental physical quantities.\n", "  A novel model of analyzing Schmitt trigger as 2 level (metastable/stable)\nenergy system is presented. The energy of the 2 level system is identified. In\nan MOS implementation, this arises from the electrostatic potential energy of\nthe electrons on the gate to source capacitance of the cross coupled MOS\ntransistors. The electrostatic energy, upon co-ordinate transformation,\n(incorporating the nonlinear MOS device behaviour and cross coupling), yields\nan expression for the 2 level system energy. The 2 level system, described\nunder the transformed co-ordinate, is simulated. Simulation on the dynamics of\nthe system shows a metastsable state and two stable states, corresponding to\nthe a maximum(metastable) energy and a minimum(stable) energy, as predicted by\nthe energy expression in the model. This result agrees with earlier attempt\nbased on nonlinear dynamic system approach, whereby the potential is\ninterpreted from the point of view of the gradient of vector field. In\naddition, the model gives physical design insight on how the change in circuit\nparameters (such as gm, R), affects the energy characteristics, hence leads to\neffective design of such 2 level system.\n", "  The classical picture of the force on a capacitor assumes a large density of\nelectronic states, such that the electrochemical potential of charges added to\nthe capacitor is given by the external electrostatic potential and the\ncapacitance is determined purely by geometry. Here we consider capacitively\ndriven motion of a nano-mechanical resonator with a low density of states, in\nwhich these assumptions can break down. We find three leading-order corrections\nto the classical picture: the first of is a modulation in the static force due\nto variation in the internal chemical potential, the second and third are\nchange in static force and dynamic spring constant due to the rate of change of\nchemical potential, expressed as the quantum (density of states) capacitance.\nAs a demonstration, we study a capacitively driven graphene mechanical\nresonators, where the chemical potential is modulated independently of the gate\nvoltage using an applied magnetic field to manipulate the energy of electrons\nresiding in discrete Landau levels. In these devices, we observe large periodic\nfrequency shifts consistent with the three corrections to the classical\npicture. In devices with extremely low strain and disorder, the first\ncorrection term dominates and the resonant frequency closely follows the\nchemical potential. The theoretical model fits the data with only one\nadjustable parameter representing disorder-broadening of the Landau levels. The\nunderlying electromechanical coupling mechanism is not limited the particular\nchoice of material, geometry, or mechanism for variation in chemical potential,\nand can thus be extended to other low-dimensional systems.\n", "  We prove an averaging formula for the derivative of the absolutely continuous\npart of the density of states measure for an ergodic family of CMV matrices. As\na consequence, we show that the spectral type of such a family is almost surely\npurely absolutely continuous if and only if the density of states is absolutely\ncontinuous and the Lyapunov exponent vanishes almost everywhere with respect to\nthe same. Both of these results are CMV operator analogues of theorems obtained\nby Kotani for Schr\\\"odinger operators.\n", "  This paper discusses a continuum approach to track the evolution of\npermeability in granular rocks by accounting for the combined effect of\nporosity changes, grain breakage and cement bond damage. To account for such a\nbroad range of microscopic processes under general loading paths, the Breakage\nMechanics theory is used and the computed mechanical response is linked with\nthe Kozeny equation, i.e. a permeability model able to evaluate the reduction\nof the hydraulic conductivity resulting from the simultaneous loss of porosity\nand growth of surface area. In particular, the evolution of the internal\nvariables of the model has been linked to idealized geometric schemes at\nparticle scale, with the goal to distinguish the contribution of the fines\ngenerated by the disaggregation of the cement matrix from that of the broken\nfragments resulting from the crushing of the skeleton. Compression/flow\nexperiments available in the literature for different granular rocks are used\nto validate the proposed methodology. The analyses illustrate that the drop of\nthe permeability of damaged rocks would be severely underestimated without an\naccurate computation of the growth of surface area, as well as that the\ndistributed fragmentation of skeleton particles tends to have stronger\nimplications than the generation of cement fines. These findings, along with\nthe satisfactory agreement between model predictions and experiments, stress\nthe benefits of adopting microstructure-based constitutive laws for the\nanalysis of coupled hydro-mechanical problems.\n", "  Two-dimensional (2D) carbon nitride materials play an important role in\nenergy-harvesting, energy-storage and environmental applications. Recently, a\nnew carbon nitride, 2D polyaniline (C3N) was proposed [PNAS 113 (2016)\n7414-7419]. Based on the structure model of this C3N monolayer, we propose two\nnew carbon nitride monolayers, named dumbbell (DB) C4N-I and C4N-II. Using\nfirst-principles calculations, we systematically study the structure,\nstability, and band structure of these two materials. In contrast to other\ncarbon nitride monolayers, the orbital hybridization of the C/N atoms in the DB\nC4N monolayers is sp3. Remarkably, the band structures of the two DB C4N\nmonolayers have a Dirac cone at the K point and their Fermi velocities are\ncomparable to that of graphene. This makes them promising materials for\napplications in high-speed electronic devices. Using a tight-binding model, we\nexplain the origin of the Dirac cone.\n", "  Advances in robotics and additive manufacturing have become game-changing for\nthe prospects of space industry. It has become feasible to bootstrap a\nself-sustaining, self-expanding industry at reasonably low cost. Simple\nmodeling was developed to identify the main parameters of successful\nbootstrapping. This indicates that bootstrapping can be achieved with as little\nas 12 metric tons (MT) landed on the Moon during a period of about 20 years.\nThe equipment will be teleoperated and then transitioned to full autonomy so\nthe industry can spread to the asteroid belt and beyond. The strategy begins\nwith a sub-replicating system and evolves it toward full self-sustainability\n(full closure) via an in situ technology spiral. The industry grows\nexponentially due to the free real estate, energy, and material resources of\nspace. The mass of industrial assets at the end of bootstrapping will be 156 MT\nwith 60 humanoid robots, or as high as 40,000 MT with as many as 100,000\nhumanoid robots if faster manufacturing is supported by launching a total of 41\nMT to the Moon. Within another few decades with no further investment, it can\nhave millions of times the industrial capacity of the United States. Modeling\nover wide parameter ranges indicates this is reasonable, but further analysis\nis needed. This industry promises to revolutionize the human condition.\n", "  Autonomous oscillators, such as clocks and lasers, produce periodic signals\n\\emph{without} any external frequency reference. In order to sustain stable\nperiodic motions, there needs to be external energy supply as well as\nnonlinearity built into the oscillator to regulate the amplitude. Usually,\nnonlinearity is provided by the sustaining feedback mechanism, which also\nsupplies energy, whereas the constituent resonator that determines the output\nfrequency stays linear. Here we propose a new self-sustaining scheme that\nrelies on the nonlinearity originating from the resonator itself to limit the\noscillation amplitude, while the feedback remains linear. We introduce a model\nto describe the working principle of the self-sustained oscillations and\nvalidate it with experiments performed on a nonlinear microelectromechanical\n(MEMS) based oscillator.\n", "  It is shown that polarized light can be polarization squeezed only if it\nexhibits sub-Poissonian statistics with the Mandel's Q factor less than -1/2.\n", "  Polarization squeezing is shown to occur in non-degenerate parametric\namplification of coherent light and the degree of squeezing at interaction time\n$T$ can be as large as $1-e^{-2T}$. This gives $86.4\\%$ polarization squeezing\nfor $T=1$ and $98.2\\%$ for $T=2$. One simple case when this occurs is on taking\ninitially plane polarized light having equal amplitudes in the two modes that\nfinally has equal intensities of two circular polarizations. This suggest the\nexperimental settings of parameters to achieve this extent of polarization\nsqueezing in coherent light.\n", "  All electronic, optoelectronic or photovoltaic applications of silicon depend\non controlling majority charge carriers via doping with impurity atoms.\nNanoscale silicon is omnipresent in fundamental research (quantum dots,\nnanowires) but also approached in future technology nodes of the\nmicroelectronics industry. In general, silicon nanovolumes, irrespective of\ntheir intended purpose, suffer from effects that impede conventional doping due\nto fundamental physical principles such as out-diffusion, statistics of small\nnumbers, quantum- or dielectric confinement. In analogy to the concept of\nmodulation doping, originally invented for III-V semiconductors, we demonstrate\na heterostructure modulation doping method for silicon. Our approach utilizes a\nspecific acceptor state of aluminium atoms in silicon dioxide to generate holes\nas majority carriers in adjacent silicon. By relocating the dopants from\nsilicon to silicon dioxide, Si nanoscale doping problems are circumvented. In\naddition, the concept of aluminium-induced acceptor states for passivating hole\nselective tunnelling contacts as required for high-efficiency photovoltaics is\npresented and corroborated by first carrier lifetime measurements.\n", "  We study the order-disorder transition in a collection of polar\nself-propelled particles, interacting through a distance dependent short range\nalignment interaction. A distance dependent interaction parameter $a_0$ is\nintroduced such that on decreasing $a_0$ interaction decay faster with distance\n$d$ and for $a_0=1.0$ model reduces to Vicsek's type. For all $a_0>0.0$, system\nshows a transition from disorder to long ranged ordered state. We find another\nphase transition from phase separated to nonphase separated state with\ndecreasing $a_0$: at the same time order-disorder transition changes from\ndiscontinuous to continuous type. Hence density phase separation plays an\nimportant role in predicting the nature of order-disorder transition. We also\ncalculate the two-point density structure factor using coarse-grained\nhydrodynamic equations of motion with an introduction of a density dependent\nalignment term in the equation introduced by Toner and Tu \\cite{tonertu}.\nDensity structure factor shows a divergence at a critical wave-vector $q_c$,\nwhich decreases with decreasing density dependent alignment term. Alignment\nterm in the coarse-grained equation plays the same role as the distance\ndependent parameter $a_0$ in the microscopic simulation. Our results can be\ntested in many biological systems: where particle have tendency to interact\nstrongly with their closest neighbours.\n", "  Sunspot area data are important for studying solar activity and its long term\nvariations. At the Debrecen Heliophysical Observatory, we compiled three\nsunspot catalogues: the Debrecen Photoheliographic Data (DPD), the SDO/HMI\nDebrecen Data (HMIDD), and the SOHO/MDI Debrecen Data. For comparison, we also\ncompiled an additional sunspot catalogue, the Greenwich Photoheliographic Data,\nfrom the digitized Royal Greenwich Observatory images for the 1974-76. By\ncomparing these catalogues when they overlap in time, we can investigate how\nvarious factors influence the measured area of the sunspots, and, in addition,\nwe can derive area cross-calibration factors for these catalogues.The main\nfindings are as follows. The poorer seeing increases the individual corrected\nspot areas and decreases the number of the small spots. Interestingly, the net\nresult of these two effects for the total corrected spot area is zero. DPD\ndaily total corrected sunspot areas are 5 per cent smaller than the HMIDD ones.\nRevised DPD daily total corrected umbra areas are 9 per cent smaller than those\nof HMIDD. The Greenwich Photoheliographic Result areas are only a few per cent\nsmaller than DPD areas. A $0.2^{\\circ}$ difference between the North directions\nof the DPD and MDI images is found. This value is nearly the same as that was\nfound ($0.22^{\\circ}$) by us in a previous paper comparing HMI and MDI images.\nThe Solar Observing Optical Network area measurement practice (spots smaller\nthan $10 mh$ were not directly measured but an area of $2 mh$ were assigned to\neach) can not explain the large area deficit of the Solar Observing Optical\nNetwork.\n", "  The technique is presented of restoring the electronic density of states of\nthe valence band from data of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The originality\nof the technique consists in using a stochastic procedure to solve an integral\nequation relating the density of states and the experimental X-ray\nphotoelectron spectra. The results are presented for bulk sample of gold and\nnanoclusters of tantalum; the possibility of using the results to determine the\ndensity of states of low-dimensional structures, including ensembles of metal\nnanoclusters, is demonstrated.\n", "  The long-range contribution to dispersion forces is known to have a major\nimpact on the properties of inhomogeneous fluids, and its correct treatment is\nincreasingly recognized as being a necessary requirement to avoid\ncutoff-related artefacts. Although analytical corrections for quantities like\nthe surface tension are known, these can not take into account the structural\nchanges induced by the long-range contributions. Here, we analyze the\ninterfacial properties of seven popular water models, comparing the results\nwith the cut-off version of the dispersion potential. The differences in\nsurface tension estimates are in all cases found to be less than 2 mN/m.\n", "  We suggest here a method to detect gravitational waves (GW) different from\nthe interferometric approach. It is based on two critical steps: conversion of\nthe GW action into rotational motion and subsequent conversion into electric\ncurrent. The ability to detect extremely tiny currents empowers this suggested\napproach in which the gravitational wave moves charges around closed loops.\nThis new method may allow detection of gravitational waves with strain\nsensitivities beyond the reach of the interferometric approaches.\n", "  The dynamics of a charged two-qubit system prepared initially in a maximum\nentangled state is discussed, where each qubit interacts independently with a\ndephasing channel. The Fisher information is used to estimate the channel and\nthe energy parameters. Moreover, the contribution from different parts of\nFisher information is discussed. We show that, the degree of estimation of any\nparameter depends on the initial value of this parameter. It turns out that the\nupper bounds of Fisher information with respect to the dephasing parameter\nincrease and that corresponding to coupling parameter decreases as the initial\nenergy of each qubit increases.\n", "  We have computed the hadronic light-by-light (LbL) contribution to the muon\nanomalous magnetic moment $a_\\mu$ in the frame of Chiral Perturbation Theory\nwith the inclusion of the lightest resonance multiplets as dynamical fields\n(R$\\chi$T). It is essential to give a more accurate prediction of this hadronic\ncontribution due to the future projects of J-Parc and FNAL on reducing the\nuncertainty in this observable. We, therefore, computed the pseudoscalar\ntransition form factor and proposed the measurement of the\n$e^+e^-\\to\\mu^+\\mu^-\\pi^0$ cross section and dimuon invariant mass spectrum to\ndetermine more accurately its parameters. Then, we evaluated the pion exchange\ncontribution to $a_\\mu$, obtaining $(6.66\\pm0.21)\\cdot10^{-10}$. By comparing\nthe pion exchange contribution and the pion-pole approximation to the\ncorresponding transition form factor ($\\pi$TFF) we recalled that the latter\nunderestimates the complete $\\pi$TFF by (15-20)\\%. Then, we obtained the\n$\\eta^({}'^)$ TFF, obtaining a total contribution of the lightest pseudoscalar\nexchanges of $(10.47\\pm0.54)\\cdot10^{-10}$, in agreement with previous results\nand with smaller error.\n", "  In the Letter by Nanette N. Jarenwattananon and Louis-S. Bouchard [PRL 114,\n197601 (2015)] an NMR experiment on gases in the presence of a magnetic-field\ngradient has been considered. As distinct from the traditional description of\nmolecular self-diffusion, the authors calculate the decoherence of the signal\ntaking into account the histories of molecular displacements. For this purpose\nthe generalized Langevin equation (GLE) is applied. We show that the use of\nthis equation is inappropriate. The calculations performed in the Letter are\nnot correct and do not lead to the reported revised expression for line\nbroadening that takes into account the autocorrelation effects in the diffusion\nprocess. The surprising temperature behavior of the observed NMR signal is thus\nnot explained. In particular, the linewidth does not follow the power law f ~\nT^(-1/2) at high temperatures.\n  We give also Remarks on the Jarenwattananon and Bouchard Reply [Phys. Rev.\nLett. 117, 249702 (2016)].\n", "  The aim of this work is to present our new series of chemical evolution\nmodels computed for spiral and low mass galaxies of different total masses and\nstar formation efficiencies. We analyze the results of models, in particular\nthe evolution of the radial gradient of oxygen abundance. Furthermore, we study\nthe role of the infall rate and of the star formation history on the variations\nof this radial gradient. The relations between the O/H radial gradient and\nother spiral galaxies characteristics as the size or the stellar mass are also\nshown. We find that the radial gradient is mainly a scale effect which\nbasically does not change with the redshift (or time) if it is measured within\nthe optical radius. Moreover, when it is measured as a function of a normalized\nradius, show a similar value for all galaxies masses, showing a correlation\nwith a dispersion around an average value which is due to the differences star\nformation efficiencies, in agreement with the idea of an universal O/H radial\ngradient\n", "  Non-Newtonian fluid flow might be driven by spatially nonlocal velocity, the\ndynamics of which can be described by promising fractional derivative models.\nThis short communication proposes a space FrActional-order Constitutive\nEquation (FACE) that links viscous shear stress with the velocity gradient, and\nthen interprets physical properties of non-Newtonian fluids for steady pipe\nflow. Results show that the generalized FACE model contains previous\nnon-Newtonian fluid flow models as end-members by simply adjusting the order of\nthe fractional index, and a preliminary test shows that the FACE model\nconveniently captures the observed growth of shear stress for various velocity\ngradients. Further analysis of the velocity profile, frictional head loss, and\nReynolds number using the FACE model also leads to analytical tools and\ncriterion that can significantly extend standard models in quantifying the\ncomplex dynamics of non-Newtonian fluid flow with a wide range of spatially\nnonlocal velocities.\n", "  We report a study of long-range MoS2-substrate interaction using resonant\nRaman imaging. We observed a strong thickness-dependent peak shift of a\nRaman-forbidden mode that can be used as a new method of determining the\nthickness of multilayered MoS2 flakes. In addition, dependence of the Raman\nscattering intensity on thickness is explained by the interference enhancement\ntheory. Finally, the resonant Raman spectra on different substrates are\nanalysed.\n", "  Understanding community structure in social media is critical due to its\nbroad applications such as friend recommendations, link predictions and\ncollaborative filtering. However, there is no widely accepted definition of\ncommunity in literature. Existing work use structure related metrics such as\nmodularity and function related metrics such as ground truth to measure the\nperformance of community detection algorithms, while ignoring an important\nmetric, size of the community. [1] suggests that the size of community with\nstrong ties in social media should be limited to 150. As we discovered in this\npaper, the majority of the communities obtained by many popular community\ndetection algorithms are either very small or very large. Too small communities\ndon't have practical value and too large communities contain weak connections\ntherefore not stable. In this paper, we compare various community detection\nalgorithms considering the following metrics: size of the communities, coverage\nof the communities, extended modularity, triangle participation ratio, and user\ninterest in the same community. We also propose a simple clique based algorithm\nfor community detection as a baseline for the comparison. Experimental results\nshow that both our proposed algorithm and the well-accepted disjoint algorithm\nInfoMap perform well in all the metrics.\n", "  A straight-forward extension of the Jackson-Hunt theory for directionally\nsolidifying multi-phase growth where the number of components exceeds the\nnumber of solid phases becomes difficult on account of the absence of the\nrequired number of equations to determine the boundary layer compositions ahead\nof the interface. In this paper, we therefore revisit the Jackson-Hunt(JH) type\ncalculations for any given situation of multi-phase growth in a multi-component\nsystem and self-consistently derive the variations of the compositions of the\nsolid phases as well as their volume fractions, which grow such that the\ncomposite solid-liquid interface is isothermal. This allows us to unify the\n(JH) calculation schemes for both in-variant as well as multi-variant eutectic\nreactions. The derived analytical expressions are then utilized to study the\neffect of dissimilar solute diffusivities and interfacial energies on the\nundercoolings and the solidified fractions. We also perform phase field\nsimulations to confirm our theoretical predictions and find a good agreement\nbetween our analytical calculations and model predictions for model symmetric\nalloys as well as for a particular Ni-Al-Zr alloy.\n", "  We study the ground state of spinless fermions living on a sphere across\n$p$-wave Feschbach resonances. By construsting a microscopic model of fermions\non a general curved surface, we show that the Guassian curvature induces an\nemergent magnetic field coupled to the $p\\pm ip$ order parameters. In the case\nof a sphere, the magnetic field corresponds to a Dirac monopole field, which\ncauses topological defects in the superfluid ground state. Using the BCS mean\nfield theory, we calculate its many-body ground state self consistently and\ngive the phase diagram. The ground state may exhibit two types of topological\ndefects, two voritces on the south and north pole or a domain wall which\nseparates $p_\\theta+ ip_\\phi$ and $p_\\theta-ip_\\phi$ superfluids.\n", "  The Plastic Scintillator Detector (PSD) is one of the main sub-detectors in\nthe DArk Matter Particle Explorer (DAMPE) project. It will be operated over a\nlarge temperature range from -$10$ to $30^{\\circ}$C, so the temperature effect\nof the whole detection system should be studied in detail. The temperature\ndependence of the PSD system is mainly contributed by the three parts: the\nplastic scintillator bar, the photomultiplier tube (PMT), and the Front End\nElectronics (FEE). These three parts have been studied in detail and the\ncontribution of each part has been obtained and discussed. The temperature\ncoefficient of the PMT is $-0.320(\\pm0.033)\\%/^{\\circ}$C, and the coefficient\nof the plastic scintillator bar is $-0.036(\\pm0.038)\\%/^{\\circ}$C. This result\nmeans that after subtracting the FEE pedestal, the variation of the signal\namplitude of the PMT-scintillator system due to temperature mainly comes from\nthe PMT, and the plastic scintillator bar is not sensitive to temperature over\nthe operating range. Since the temperature effect cannot be ignored, the\ntemperature dependence of the whole PSD has been also studied and a correction\nhas been made to minimize this effect. The correction result shows that the\neffect of temperature on the signal amplitude of the PSD system can be\nsuppressed.\n", "  From our powder x ray diffraction pattern, electrical transport and magnetic\nstudies we report the effect of isovalent Se substitution at S sites in the\nnewly discovered systems EuSr2Bi2S4F4 and Eu2SrBi2S4F4. We have synthesized two\nnew variants of 3244 type superconductor with Eu replaced by Sr which is\nreported elsewhere [Z. Haque et. al.]. We observe superconductivity at Tc 2.9 K\n(resistivity) and 2.3 K (susceptibility) in EuSr2Bi2S4-xSexF4 series for x = 2.\nIn the other series Eu2SrBi2S4-xSexF4, two materials (x= 1.5; Tc = 2.6 K and x\n= 2; Tc = 2.75 K) exhibit superconductivity.\n", "  Many materials exhibit nanoscale phase separation, when inside the host\nthermodynamic phase there arise nanosize embryos of another thermodynamic\nphase. A prominent example of this phenomenon is provided by ferroelectric\nmaterials. The theoretical description of such phase heterogeneous materials is\nquite challenging, since they are essentially nonuniform, the nonuniformity is\nrandom, and often they are quasiequilibrium, but not absolutely equilibrium. An\napproach is suggested for the theoretical description of phase separated\nferroelectrics, consisting of a ferroelectric matrix with nanoscale\nparaelectric inclusions. The properties of the heterophase ferroelectrics are\nstudied.\n", "  We develop a microscopic approach to the kinetic theory of many-particle\nsystems with dissipative and potential interactions in presence of active\nfluctuations. The approach is based on a generalization of\nBogolyubov--Peletminsky reduced description method applied to the systems of\nmany active particles. It is shown that the microscopic approach developed\nallows to construct the kinetic theory of two- and three-dimensional systems of\nactive particles in presence of non-linear friction (dissipative interaction)\nand an external random field with active fluctuations. The kinetic equations\nfor these systems in case of a weak interaction between the particles (both\npotential and dissipative) and low-intensity active fluctuations are obtained.\nWe demonstrate particular cases in which the derived kinetic equations have\nsolutions that match the results known in the literature. It is shown that the\ndisplay of the head-tail asymmetry and self-propelling even in the case of a\nlinear friction, is one of the consequences of the local nature of the active\nfluctuations.\n", "  This paper is an introduction to the eleven works of the special issue on\nQuantum and Classical Frontiers of Noise. The weather, and its butterfly\neffect, is the typical example that explain why many natural phenomena are, in\nfact, not predictable with certainty. Noise in classical or quantum phenomena,\nunderstood as the difference between the empirical output of an experiment and\nits statistical prediction, is a measure of such uncertainty. One of the great\ncontributions of noise appeared in 1905 when Einstein showed how the noisy\n(Brownian) motion of a dust particle seen in a microscope provided\nuncontroversial evidences on the existence of the (unseen) atoms. The aim of\nthis special issue is to provoke discussions on how noise can help us to better\nunderstand (the reality behind) classical and quantum theories, and the\nfrontier between them.\n", "  In this paper we present a review on our recent experimental investigations\ninto the phase behavior of the deeply cooled water confined in a nanoporous\nsilica material, MCM-41, with elastic neutron scattering technique. Under such\nstrong confinement, the homogeneous nucleation process of water is avoided,\nwhich allows the confined water to keep its liquid state at temperatures and\npressures that are inaccessible to the bulk water. By measuring the average\ndensity of the confined heavy water, we observe a likely first-order\nlow-density liquid (LDL) to high-density liquid (HDL) transition in the deeply\ncooled region of the confined heavy water. The phase separation starts from\n1.12 +- 0.17 kbar and 215 +- 1K and extends to higher pressures and lower\ntemperatures in the phase diagram. This starting point could be the\nliquid-liquid critical point of the confined water. The locus of the Widom line\nis also estimated. The observation of the liquid-liquid transition in the\nconfined water has potential to explain the mysterious behaviors of water at\nlow temperatures. In addition, it may also have impacts on other disciplines,\nbecause the confined water system represents many biological and geological\nsystems in which water resides in nanoscopic pores or in the vicinity of\nhydrophilic or hydrophobic surfaces.\n", "  Exciton Scattering (ES) theory attributes excited electronic states to\nstanding waves in quasi-one-dimensional molecular materials by assuming a\nquasi-particle picture of optical excitations. The quasi-particle properties at\nbranching centers are described by the corresponding scattering matrices. Here\nwe identify the topological invariant of scattering center, referred to as its\nwinding number, and apply topological intersection theory to count the number\nof quantum states in a quasi-one-dimensional system.\n", "  These talks review and summarize our results in [1,2] on $XYZ$-like spectra\nobtained from QCD Laplace Sum Rules in the chiral limit at next-to-next-leading\norder (N2LO) of perturbation theory (PT) and including leading order (LO)\ncontributions of dimensions $d\\leq 6-8$ non-perturbative condensates. We\nconclude that the observed $XZ$ states are good candidates for $1^{+}$ and\n$0^+$ molecules or / and four-quark states while the predictions for $1^-$ and\n$0^-$ states are about 1.5 GeV above the $Y_{c,b}$ experimental candidates and\nhadronic thresholds. We (numerically) find that these exotic molecules couple\nweakly to the corresponding interpolating currents than ordinary $D,B$\nheavy-light mesons while we observe that these couplings decrease faster\n[$1/m_b^{3/2}$ (resp. $1/m_b$) for the $1^+,0^+$ (resp. $1^-,0^-)$ states] than\n$1/m_b^{1/2}$. Our results do not also confirm the existence of the $X(5568)$\nstate in agreement with LHCb findings.\n", "  A prototype model of a stochastic one-variable system with a linear restoring\nforce driven by two cross-correlated multiplicative and additive Gaussian white\nnoises was considered earlier [S. I. Denisov et al., Phys. Rev. E 68, 046132\n(2003)]. The multiplicative factor was assumed to be quadratic in the vicinity\nof a stable equilibrium point. It was determined that a negative\ncross-correlation can induce nonequilibrium transitions. In this paper, we\ninvestigate this model in more detail and calculate explicit expressions of the\nstationary probability density. We construct a phase diagram and show that both\nadditive and multiplicative noises can also generate bimodal probability\ndistributions of the state variable in the presence of anti-correlation. We\nfind the order parameter and determine that the additive noise has a\ndisordering effect and the multiplicative noise has an ordering effect. We\nexplain the mechanism of this bistability and specify its key ingredients.\n", "  We report the discovery of a planet --- OGLE-2014-BLG-0676Lb --- via\ngravitational microlensing. Observations for the lensing event were made by the\nMOA, OGLE, Wise, RoboNET/LCOGT, MiNDSTEp and $\\mu$FUN groups. All analyses of\nthe light curve data favour a lens system comprising a planetary mass orbiting\na host star. The most favoured binary lens model has a mass ratio between the\ntwo lens masses of $(4.78 \\pm 0.13)\\times 10^{-3}$. Subject to some important\nassumptions, a Bayesian probability density analysis suggests the lens system\ncomprises a $3.09_{-1.12}^{+1.02}$ M_jup planet orbiting a\n$0.62_{-0.22}^{+0.20}$ M_sun host star at a deprojected orbital separation of\n$4.40_{-1.46}^{+2.16}$ AU. The distance to the lens system is\n$2.22_{-0.83}^{+0.96}$ kpc. Planet OGLE-2014-BLG-0676Lb provides additional\ndata to the growing number of cool planets discovered using gravitational\nmicrolensing against which planetary formation theories may be tested. Most of\nthe light in the baseline of this event is expected to come from the lens and\nthus high-resolution imaging observations could confirm our planetary model\ninterpretation.\n", "  Attachment of chemical substituents (such as polar moieties) constitutes an\nefficient and convenient way to modify physical and chemical properties of\nconjugated polymers and oligomers. Associated modifications in the molecular\nelectronic states can be comprehensively described by examining scattering of\nexcitons in the polymer's backbone at the scattering center representing the\nchemical substituent. Here, we implement effective tight-binding models as a\ntool to examine the analytical properties of the exciton scattering matrices in\nsemi-infinite polymer chains with substitutions. We demonstrate that chemical\ninteractions between the substitution and attached polymer are adequately\ndescribed by the analytical properties of the scattering matrices. In\nparticular, resonant and bound electronic excitations are expressed via the\npositions of zeros and poles of the scattering amplitude, analytically\ncontinued to complex values of exciton quasi-momenta. We exemplify the\nformulated concepts by analyzing excited states in conjugated phenylacetylenes\nsubstituted by perylene.\n", "  In the paper, a new method determining the wave vector star channel in the\nreciprocal lattice space of crystal in the light of the translational symmetry\nbreaking is proposed, and, in order to consider the phase transitions according\nto the wave vector star channel, the conception of wave vector star channel\ngroup is adopted. By this method, it is revealed that the phase transitions in\ncrystal are induced not by any arbitrary combinations of arms of the given\nstar, but by the selected combinations of arms which are satisfied by symmetry\nof the parent phase. The wave vector star channel group is defined as the set\nof elements of space group leaving the wave vector star channel invariant. We\nshow that the conception of wave vector star channel group can be efficiently\nused in studying the translational symmetry breaking related to all the\nLifshitz wave vector stars of 230 space groups.\n", "  In the paper we establish the new conception of the wave vector substar group\nand its representation that, in the study on translational symmetry breaking of\ncrystal, can only consider the particular arms of wave vector star taking part\nin phase transition, but not all arms of wave vector star, unlike the\ntraditional Landau theory. We show that using the new conception, we can\neffectively investigate the interesting physical properties of crystals\nassociated with translational symmetry breaking. We can see that the studies on\nthe complicated phase transitions related to reducible representations, such as\nphase transitions in perovskite KMnF3 multiferroics crystal and high\ntemperature superconductor La2/3Mg1/2W1/2O3 (La4Mg3W3O18) compound, are much\nsimplified by the new conception, and the theory of the wave vector substar\ngroup and its representation becomes a powerful mathematical tool being able to\npromote actively the study of various symmetry breaking phenomena of solid\nstate crystals .\n", "  We studied the transmission characteristics of a planar metamaterial\nconsisting of an array of electric split-ring resonators (eSRRs) with double\nperiodicity. Because of coupling between different resonant modes induced by\ndifferent lattice periods in metamaterials with double periodicity, the\nappearance of Fano resonance can be expected in the same manner as that in the\ncase of coupled classical oscillators. We fabricated complementary eSRRs and\nverified that a Fano-like spectral shape appeared in the transmission spectra\nof eSRRs with double periodicity in the terahertz region.\n", "  Various clusters of metallic or dielectric nanoparticles can exhibit sharp\nFano resonances originating from at least two modes interference of different\nspectral width. However, for practical applications such as biosensing or\nnonlinear nanophotonics, the fine-tuning of the Fano resonances is generally\nrequired. Here, we propose and demonstrate a novel type of hybrid oligomers\nconsisting of asymmetric metal-dielectric (Au/Si) nanoparticles with a sharp\nFano resonance in visible range, which has a predominantly magnetic origin. We\ndemonstrate both, numerically and experimentally, that such hybrid nanoparticle\noligomers allow fine-tuning of the Fano resonance via fs-laser induced melting\nof Au nanoparticles at the nanometer scale. We show that the Fano resonance\nwavelength can be changed by fs-laser reshaping very precisely (within 15~nm)\nbeing accompanied by a reconfiguration of its profile.\n", "  High mobility two-dimensional electron gases (2DEGs) underpin today's silicon\nbased devices and are of fundamental importance for the emerging field of oxide\nelectronics. Such 2DEGs are usually created by engineering band offsets and\ncharge transfer at heterointerfaces. However, in 2011 it was shown that highly\nitinerant 2DEGs can also be induced at bare surfaces of different transition\nmetal oxides where they are far more accessible to high resolution angle\nresolved photoemission (ARPES) experiments. Here we review work from this\nnascent field which has led to a systematic understanding of the subband\nstructure arising from quantum confinement of highly anisotropic transition\nmetal d-states along different crystallographic directions. We further discuss\nthe role of different surface preparations and the origin of surface 2DEGs, the\nunderstanding of which has permitted control over 2DEG carrier densities.\nFinally, we discuss signatures of strong many-body interactions and how\nspectroscopic data from surface 2DEGs may be related to the transport\nproperties of interface 2DEGs in the same host materials.\n", "  We study WZ production with anomalous couplings at $\\bar{n}$NLO QCD using the\nLoopSim method in combination with the Monte Carlo program VBFNLO. Higher order\ncorrections to WZ production are dominated by additional hard jet radiation.\nThose contributions are insensitive to anomalous couplings and should thus be\nremoved in analyses. We do this using a dynamical jet veto based on the\ntransverse energy of the QCD and EW final state particles. This removes jet\ndominated events without introducing problematic logs like a fixed\n$p_{\\text{T}}$ jet veto.\n", "  Although new photovoltaic materials, such as organic perovskites, have\nattracted much attention recently,\\cite{perov1,perov2,perov3} zinc-blende\nsemiconductors still play an important role, owing to their high efficiency and\nstability in real environments. For example, Cu$_2$ZnSnSe$_4$ \\cite{AM2013}\n(CZTS) and Cu(In,Ga)Se$_2$ \\cite{JACS2008} (CIGS), which are both based on\nchalcopyrite CuGa$X_2$ ($X=$ S, Se), have been considered as potential\ncandidates for photovoltaics. It has been reported recently that the efficiency\nof CIGS has gone beyond 20\\%, which is close to that of polycrystalline s\nilicon.\\cite{efficiency2014} Furthermore, photovoltaic devices related to CZTS\nhave gained attention because they solely contain abundant and nontoxic\nmaterials.\\cite{AM2013,CZTS}\n", "  The nonlinear electron and heat currents of quantum dot molecules (QDMs)\nunder a temperature bias are theoretically investigated, including all\ncorrelation functions arising from electron Coulomb interactions in QDMs.\nUnlike the case of double QDs, the maximum efficiency of serially coupled\ntriple QDs (SCTQD) occurs in the orbital depletion regime owing to the interdot\nCoulomb blockade. The electron current in SCTQD shows a bipolar oscillatory\nbehavior with respect to the variation of QD energy levels, whereas the heat\ncurrent does not show such a behavior. This is mainly attributed to\nthermal-induced bias. In addition, we illustrate how the efficiency of SCTQD is\ninfluenced by the external load resistance, and phonon heat flow. Finally, a\ndirection-dependent electron current driven by a temperature bias has been\ndemonstrated for a SCTQD with staircase-like energy levels.\n", "  We study the polarization response of the emission from type-II GaAsSb capped\nInAs quantum dots. The theoretical prediction based on the calculations of the\noverlap integrals of the single-particle states obtained in the k.p framework\nis given. This is verified experimentally by polarization resolved\nphotoluminescence measurements on samples with the type-II confinement. We show\nthat the polarization anisotropy might be utilized to find the vertical\nposition of the hole wavefunction and its orientation with respect to\ncrystallographic axes of the sample. A proposition for usage in the information\ntechnology as a room temperature photonic gate operating at the communication\nwavelengths as well as a simple model to estimate the energy of fine-structure\nsplitting for type-II GaAsSb capped InAs QDs are given.\n", "  By using a hydrothermal ion-exchange method, we have successfully grown\nsuperconducting crystals of LiOHFeS with ${T_c}$ of about 2.8 K. Being\ndifferent from the sister sample (Li${_{1-x}}$Fe${_x}$)OHFeSe, the energy\ndispersion spectrum analysis on LiOHFeS shows that the Fe/S ratio is very close\nto 1:1, suggesting an almost charge neutrality and less electron doping in the\nFeS planes of the system. Comparing with the non superconducting LiOHFeS\ncrystal, each peak of the X-ray diffraction pattern of the superconducting\ncrystal splits into two, and the diffraction peaks locating at lower reflection\nangles are consistent with that of non-superconducting ones. The rest set of\ndiffraction peaks with higher reflection angles is corresponding to the\nsuperconducting phase, suggesting that the superconducting phase may has a\nshrunk c-axis lattice constant. Magnetization measurements indicate that the\nmagnetic shielding due to superconductivity can be quite high under a weak\nmagnetic field. The resistivity measurements under various magnetic fields show\nthat the upper critical field is quite low, which is similar to the tetragonal\nFeS superconductor.\n", "  The type and distribution of oxygen functional groups in graphene oxide (GO)\nand reduced graphene oxide (RGO) remain still a subject of great debate. Local\nanalytic techniques are required to access the chemistry of these materials at\na nanometric scale. Electron energy loss spectroscopy in a scanning\ntransmission electron microscope can provide the suitable resolution, but GO\nand RGO are extremely sensitive to electron irradiation. In this work we employ\na dedicated experimental setup to reduce electron illumination below damage\nlimit. GO oxygen maps obtained at a few nanometers scale show separated domains\nwith different oxidation levels. The C/O ratio varies from about 4:1 to 1:1,\nthe latter corresponding to a complete functionalization of the graphene\nflakes. In RGO the residual oxygen concentrates mostly in regions few tens\nnanometers wide. Specific energy-loss near-edge structures are observed for\ndifferent oxidation levels. By combining these findings with first-principles\nsimulations we propose a model for the highly oxidized domains where graphene\nis fully functionalized by hydroxyl groups forming a 2D-sp$^3$ carbon network\nanalogous to that of graphane.\n", "  We have studied theoretically the type-II GaAsSb capped InAs quantum dots for\ntwo structures differing in the composition of the capping layer, being either\n(i) constant or (ii) with Sb accumulation above the apex of the dot. We have\nfound that the hole states are segmented and resemble the states in the quantum\ndot molecules. The two-hole states form singlet and triplet with the splitting\nenergy of 4{\\mu}eV / 325{\\mu}eV for the case (i) / (ii). We have also tested\nthe possibility to tune the splitting by vertically applied magnetic field. As\nthe predicted tunability range was limited, we propose an approach for its\nenhancement.\n", "  Ordered polarity alignment of a cell population plays a vital role in\nbiology, such as in hair follicle alignment and asymmetric cell division. Here,\nwe propose a theoretical framework for the understanding of generic dynamical\nproperties of polarity alignment in interacting cellular units, where each cell\nis described by a reaction-diffusion system and the cells further interact with\none another through their proximal surfaces. The system behavior is shown to be\nstrongly dependent on geometric properties such as cell alignment and cell\nshape. Using a perturbative method under the assumption of weak coupling\nbetween cells, we derive a reduced model in which each cell is described by\njust one variable, the phase. The reduced model resembles an XY model but\ncontains novel terms that possesses geometric information, which enables the\nunderstanding of the geometric dependencies as well as the effects of external\nsignal and noise. The model is simple, generic, and analytically and\nnumerically tractable, and is therefore expected to facilitates studies on\ncellular polarity alignment in various nonequilibrium systems.\n", "  We present a general construction of matrix product states for stationary\ndensity matrices of one-dimensional quantum spin systems kept out of\nequilibrium through boundary Lindblad dynamics. As an application we review the\nisotropic Heisenberg quantum spin chain which is closely related to the\ngenerator of the simple symmetric exclusion process. Exact and heuristic\nresults as well as numerical evidence suggest a local quantum equilibrium and\nlong-range correlations reminiscent of similar large-scale properties in\nclassical stochastic interacting particle systems that can be understood in\nterms of fluctuating hydrodynamics.\n", "  The European X-ray Free Electron Laser (XFEL.EU) is currently being\ncommissioned in Schenefeld, Germany. From 2017 onwards it will provide\nspatially coherent X-rays of energies between 0.25\\,keV and 25\\,keV with a\nunique timing structure. One of the detectors foreseen at XFEL.EU for the soft\nX-ray regime (energies below 6\\,keV) is a quasi column-parallel readout FastCCD\ndeveloped by Lawrence Berkeley National Lab (LBNL) specifically for the XFEL.EU\nrequirements. Its sensor has 1920$\\times$960 pixels of 30\\,$\\mu$m\n$\\times$30\\,$\\mu$m size with a beam hole in the middle of the sensor. The\ncamera can be operated in full frame and frame store mode. With the FastCCD a\nframe rate of up to 120~fps can be achieved, but at XFEL.EU the camera settings\nare optimized for the 10\\,Hz XFEL bunch-mode. The detector has been delivered\nto XFEL.EU. Results of the performance tests and calibration done using the\nXFEL.EU detector calibration infrastructure are presented quantifying noise\nlevel, gain and energy resolution.\n", "  Polycrystalline samples of A$_x$V$_2$Al$_{20}$ (A = Ce, Th, U, Np, Pu; 0.7 =<\nx =< 1.0) actinide intermetallics were synthesized using the arc-melting\nmethod. Crystal structure studies were performed by means of powder x-ray\ndiffraction and the Rietveld refinement method. All studied compounds\ncrystallize in the CeCr$_{2}$Al$_{20}$-type structure (space group Fd-3m, no.\n227) with the actinide or Ce atom located in the oversized cage formed by Al\natoms. Comparison of the crystallographic results with the reported data for\nLnV$_{2}$Al$_{20}$ (Ln = lanthanoids) counterparts reveals distinctly different\nbehavior of the lanthanide- and actinide-bearing compounds. This difference is\nsuggested to be caused by fairly localized character of the 4f electrons,\nwhereas itinerant character of the 5f electrons is likely seen for U- and\nNp-containing phases. Magnetic susceptibility and specific heat measurements\ndid not reveal any magnetic ordering in U$_{0.8}$V$_{2}$Al$_{20}$,\nNp$_{0.8}$V$_{2}$Al$_{20}$ and Pu$_{0.8}$V$_{2}$Al$_{20}$ down to 2.5 K. A\nsmall anomaly in low-temperature specific heat of Ce$_{0.8}$V$_{2}$Al$_{20}$,\nU$_{0.8}$V$_{2}$Al$_{20}$, and Np$_{0.8}$V$_{2}$Al$_{20}$ is observed, likely\narising from a low-energy Einstein mode.\n", "  Fragment separator ACCULINNA-2 has been built in the Flerov Laboratory of\nNuclear reactions (JINR, Dubna). It is timely now to choose meaningful and\nchallenging objectives for experiments dedicated to the study of light\ndrip-line nuclei. Considerable interest makes the search for the minor\n$2p$-decay branch of the first excited state of $^{17}$Ne. The knowledge on the\n$\\Gamma_{2p}/\\Gamma_{\\gamma}$ width ratio for this excited state is of\nconsiderable interest because the reverse process of simultaneous two-proton\nradiative capture could be a bypass for the $^{15}$O \"waiting point\" occurring\nin the rp-process of nucleosynthesis. Accumulation of high-statistics data for\nthe $^{10}$He excitation spectrum populated in the $^2$H($^8$He,$p$)$^9$He and\n$^3$H($^8$He,$p$)$^{10}$He reactions, as well as the study of cross-check\nreactions made with the $^{11}$Li and $^{14}$Be beams, will make an effective\nway to clarify the succession of $^{10}$He excited states. A hot topic beyond\nthe neutron drip line makes the observation of results capable to elucidate the\nlow-energy resonance states anticipated for the $4n$ decay of $^{7}$H. The RIB\nbeams provided by ACCULINNA-2 will allow one to perform experiments where\nluminosity coming to a level of more than $2 \\times 10^{26}$ cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$\nwill be achievable in experiments aimed study of the $^2$H($^8$He,$^3$He)$^7$H\nand $^2$H($^{11}$Li,$^6$Li)$^7$H reactions.\n", "  We study extensions of the Standard Model (SM) in which copies of the SM\nscalar SU(2) doublet are added to the Higgs sector. These scalar doublets\neither acquire a Vacuum Expectation Value (VEV) and hence are active or do not\ndevelop a VEV and are inert. We consider CP-violation (CPV) in both the active\nand inert sector. As an example of a model with CPV in the active sector, we\npresent a Type-I 2-Higgs-Doublet Model (2HDM) with two active doublets and show\nLarge Hadron Collider (LHC) signals of such a scenario. The amount of CPV in\nthis case is very limited due to constraints coming from Electric Dipole Moment\nexperiments. Moreover, 2HDMs with only active doublets do not provide a Dark\nMatter (DM) candidate. As a result, we turn to 3-Higgs-Doublet Models (3HDMs)\nwhere unbounded CPV and viable DM candidates could be introduced simultaneously\nin the inert sector. We investigate DM phenomenology of such models.\n", "  In this paper we discuss some results concerning the abundance discrepancy\nproblem in the context of H II regions. We discuss the behavior of the\nabundance discrepancy factor (ADF) for different objects and ions. There are\nevidences that stellar abundances seem to agree better with the nebular ones\nderived from recombination lines in high-metallicity environments and from\ncollisionally excited lines in the low-metallicity regime. Recent data point\nout that the ADF seems to be correlated with the metallicity and the electron\ntemperature of the objects. These results open new ways for investigating the\norigin of the abundance discrepancy problem in H II regions and in ionized\nnebulae in general.\n", "  In this paper, the DSSC safety-interlock system is introduced. It is designed\nto keep the DSSC mega-pixel camera in a safe-state. The system is composed of\nfour inter-communicating sub-systems referred here as a master SIB\n(safety-interlock board) and three partner SIBs. Each SIB monitors and\nprocesses 75 temperature sensors mainly located in the focal plane and also\ndistributed inside the camera-head electronics. It monitors the signals from\ntwo pressure sensors, one humidity sensor as well as the connectivity to\nsixteen low-voltage and two high-voltage cables. The master SIB supervises the\nsignals to and from external equipments like the cooling system, pressure\ngauge, power crates and status information from experimental environment. SIB\nis an 8-layer printed-circuit board (PCB) with a micro-controller sitting on\ntop as its central processing unit. A decision-matrix software reads the sensor\nstatus continuously and determines whether the camera is in a safe state or\nnot. All error and warnings flags are sent to the detector control software\nframework and the end user directly. These flags are also stored every 100 ms\ntogether with the image data. The full SIB sensor data is sent to the back end\nfor offline analysis. A shutdown sequence is initiated by SIB in case of a\ncritical failure. The safety-interlock philosophy, hardware design, and\nsoftware architecture along with test results will be presented.\n", "  We study a new example of equation obtained as a result of a recent\ngeneralized symmetry classification of differential-difference equations\ndefined on five points of one-dimensional lattice. We have established that in\nthe continuous limit this new equation goes into the well-known\nKaup-Kupershmidt equation. We have also proved its integrability by\nconstructing an $L-A$ pair and conservation laws. Moreover, we present a\npossibly new scheme for deriving conservation laws from $L-A$ pairs.\n", "  Rational solutions of the Witten-Dijkgraaf-Verlinde-Verlinde (or WDVV)\nequations of associativity are given in terms a configurations of vectors which\nsatisfy certain algebraic conditions known as $\\bigvee$-conditions. The\nsimplest examples of such configuration are the root systems of finite Coxeter\ngroups. In this paper conditions are derived which ensure that an extended\nconfiguration - a configuration in a space one-dimension higher -satisfy these\n$\\bigvee$-conditions. Such a construction utilizes the notion of a small-orbit,\nas defined by Serganova. Symmetries of such resulting solutions to the\nWDVV-equations are studied; in particular, Legendre transformations. It is\nshown that these Legendre transformations map extended-rational solutions to\ntrigonometric solutions and, for certain values of the free data, one obtains a\ntransformation from extended $\\bigvee$-systems to the trigonometric almost dual\nsolutions corresponding to the classical extended affine Weyl groups.\n", "  Planetary nebulae are the products of the evolution of low and intermediate\nmass stars. The chemical property studies of these objects give important\ninformation about the elemental abundances as He, O, Ne, Ar, S and their\nmodifications associated with the evolution of the progenitor stars. The\ndetermination of accurate abundances in planetary nebulae is important from the\nperspective of the stellar evolution as well as the formation and chemical\nevolution of galaxies. Recently, new HeI emissivities and ionization correction\nfactors (ICFs) were published in the literature. In this work, these new\nparameters are used in a code for the determination of chemical abundances in\nphotoionized nebulae. This code is used for the recompilation of the chemical\nabundances of planetary nebulae from the Galactic bulge observed previously by\nour group and also for the determination of new chemical abundances of a sample\nof planetary nebulae located near the Galactic centre. The new emissivities and\nICFs slightly modified the elemental abundances of He, N, O, Ar and Ne. On the\nother hand, S abundances are higher than previous determinations. The new ICFs\ncan contribute to solve partially the sulphur anomaly.\n", "  The crystalline electric field (CEF) is investigated in\nPr$_3$Pt$_{23}$Si$_{11}$ and Nd$_3$Pt$_{23}$Si$_{11}$ by neutron spectroscopy\n(NS). At low temperature, the number of observed CEF excitations is consistent\nwith the orthorhombic symmetry at the rare earth site. This agrees with\nprevious results on Ce$_3$Pt$_{23}$Si$_{11}$. For Pr- and\nNd$_3$Pt$_{23}$Si$_{11}$, the number of CEF parameters is too large to allow\nfor an unambiguous determination. This determination is possible for\nCe$_3$Pt$_{23}$Si$_{11}$, due to a reduced number of parameters and to the\navailability of extensive experimental data. A specific procedure is developed\nfor this purpose that combines genetic algorithmics and optimization methods.\nAn unique set of CEF parameters is found for Ce$_3$Pt$_{23}$Si$_{11}$. It\nreveals a strong anisotropy at the orthorhombic site, responsible for an easy\nthreefold magnetization axis in the cubic system. Using a microscopic,\nmean-field, description, the magnetization processes in the paramagnetic and\nferromagnetic phases of Ce$_3$Pt$_{23}$Si$_{11}$ are well reproduced.\nCe$_3$Pt$_{23}$Si$_{11}$ is shown to realize a model for systems where\nconflicting anisotropies are forced to cooperate.\n", "  We study the bath correlation functions (BCFs) of open quantum systems\ninteracting with thermal baths, in case the spectral densities (SDs) exhibit\nremovable logarithmic singularities at low frequencies and are arbitrarily\nshaped at higher frequencies. The singularities consist in arbitrarily positive\nor negative powers of logarithmic functions, as additional factors for the\npower laws of the Ohmic-like SDs. If the SD vanishes sufficiently fast at high\nfrequencies the short time behavior of the BCF is algebraic. The long time\nbehavior of the BCF exhibits a variety of relaxations that involve inverse\npower laws and arbitrary powers of logarithmic forms. The imaginary part of the\nBCF shows over long times regular dependence on the low frequency structure of\nthe SD, except for certain conditions where the ohmicity parameter takes odd\nnatural values. Same dependence holds for the real part of the BCF at\nnon-vanishing temperatures. At zero temperature the real part of the BCF\nexhibits over long times the same regular relationship with the low frequency\nstructure of the SD, except for certain conditions involving even natural\nvalues of the ohmicity parameter. The exceptional conditions provide\nrelaxations that are faster than those obtained via the regular dependence. In\nthis way, various long time relaxations of the BCF that are slower than\nexponential decays and arbitrarily faster or slower than inverse power laws,\ncan be interpreted in terms of removable logarithmic singularities in the low\nfrequency structure SD of an open quantum system.\n", "  A steady-state structure and spectrum of the accretion zone at the surface of\nT Tauri stars are numerically simulated. This modeling uses well-developed\nmethods of the theory of stellar atmospheres with inclusion of the effects of\nthe gas motion (advection and the doppler shift of the lines). The spectrum\n$I_{\\nu}(\\mu)$ and cooling rate of shocked gas are calculated. It is found that\nat the pre-shock densities $N_0>10^{13}$ cm$^{-3}$ helium and hydrogen lines\nshow a red-shifted absorption, significantly broadened by the Stark effect.\n", "  We report the single-crystal growth and the fundamental magnetic and\nthermodynamic properties of a rare-earth triangular lattice antiferromagnet\nCeCd$_3$As$_3$. In this rare-earth antiferromagnet, the Ce local moments form a\nperfect triangular lattice. Due to the spin-orbital-entangled nature of the Ce\nlocal moments, the compound exhibits extremely anisotropic antiferromagnetic\ncouplings along the c direction and in the ab plane respectively. We show that\nCeCd$_3$As$_3$ represents a {\\it rare} experimental realization of an\nantiferromagnetic Ising model on a two dimensional triangular lattice and thus\nprovides a prototype example for geometrical frustration. We further discuss\nthe quantum effect of the perturbative interactions on the top of the\npredominant Ising interaction.\n", "  We review various contributions on the fundamental work of Lanford deriving\nthe Boltzmann equation from hard-sphere dynamics in the low density limit. We\nfocus especially on the assumptions made on the initial data and on how they\nencode irreversibility. The impossibility to reverse time in the Boltzmann\nequation (expressed for instance by Boltzmann's H-theorem) is related to the\nlack of convergence of higher order marginals on some singular sets. Explicit\ncounterexamples single out the microscopic sets where the initial data should\nconverge in order to produce the Boltzmann dynamics.\n", "  We discuss numerical strategies to deal with PDE systems describing traffic\nflows, taking into account a density threshold, which restricts the vehicles\ndensity in the situation of congestion. These models are obtained through\nasymptotic arguments. Hence, we are interested in the simulation of approached\nmodels that contain stiff terms and large speeds of propagation. We design\nschemes intended to apply with relaxed stability conditions.\n", "  As the trend of neutron guide designs points towards longer and more complex\nguides, imperfections such as waviness becomes increasingly important.\nSimulations of guide waviness has so far been limited by a lack of reasonable\nwaviness models. We here present a stochastic description of waviness and its\nimplementation in the McStas simulation package. The effect of this new\nimplementation is compared to the guide simulations without waviness and the\nsimple, yet unphysical, waviness model implemented in McStas 1.12c and 2.0.\n", "  Many experiments are currently using or proposing to use large area GEM foils\nin their detectors, which is creating a need for commercially available GEM\nfoils. Currently CERN is the only main distributor of large GEM foils, however\nwith the growing interest in GEM technology keeping up with the increasing\ndemand for GEMs will be difficult. Thus the commercialization of GEMs up to 50\n$\\times$ 50 cm$^2$ has been established by Tech-Etch Inc. of Plymouth, MA, USA\nusing the single-mask technique. The electrical performance and optical quality\nof the single-mask GEM foils have been found to be on par with those produced\nby CERN. The next critical step towards validating the Tech-Etch single-mask\nGEM foils is to test their performance under physics conditions. These\nmeasurements will allow us to quantify and compare the gain and efficiency of\nthe detector to other triple-GEM detectors. This will be done by constructing\nseveral single-mask triple-GEM detectors, using foils manufactured by\nTech-Etch, which follow the design used by the STAR Forward GEM Tracker (FGT).\nThese detectors will investigate ways in which to further decrease the material\nbudget and increase the efficiency of the detector by incorporating perforated\nKapton spacer rings rather than G10 spacing grids to reduce the dead area of\nthe detector. The materials and tooling needed to assemble the triple-GEM\ndetectors have been acquired. The GEM foils have been electrically tested, and\na handful have been optically scanned. We found these results to be consistent\nwith GEM foils produced by CERN. With the success of these initial tests,\nconstruction of the triple-GEM detectors is now under way.\n", "  We describe here a compact gantry system, when the lying patient is slowly\nmoved in horizontal and vertical directions in accordance with rotation of\ntransport channel around its axis so that the region, irradiated from different\ndirections, stays in a focus of beam optical system. By this combination of\nrotation of magnets and linear motion of patient it becomes possible to\nsimplify magnetic system significantly.\n", "  In this talk, we report our recent progress on pinning down the cause of\nnegativity in the NLO single inclusive hadron production in pA collisions at\nforward rapidity.\n", "  The $WW$ production is the primary channel to directly probe the triple gauge\ncouplings. We analyze the $e^+ e^- \\rightarrow W^+ W^-$ process at the proposed\nCircular Electron-Positron Collider (CEPC), and find that the anomalous triple\ngauge couplings and relevant dimension six operators can be probed up to the\norder of $10^{-4}$. We also estimate constraints at the 14 TeV LHC, with both\n300 fb$^{-1}$ and 3000 fb$^{-1}$ integrated luminosity from the leading lepton\n$p_T$ and azimuthal angle difference $\\Delta \\phi_{ll}$ in the di-lepton\nchannel. The constrain is somewhat weaker, up to the order of $10^{-3}$. The\nlimits on the triple gauge couplings are complementary to those on the\nelectroweak precision observables and Higgs couplings.\n", "  We investigate the statistics of stationary points in the sum of squares of\n$N$ Gaussian random fields, which we call a \"chi-squared\" field. The behavior\nof such a field at a point is investigated, with particular attention paid to\nthe formation of topological defects. An integral to compute the number density\nof stationary points at a given field amplitude is constructed. We compute\nexact expressions for the integral in various limits and provide code to\nevaluate it numerically in the general case. We investigate the dependence of\nthe number density of stationary points on the field amplitude, number of\nfields, and power spectrum of the individual Gaussian random fields. This work\nparallels the work of Bardeen, Bond, Kaiser and Szalay, who investigated the\nstatistics of peaks of Gaussian random fields. A number of results for\nintegrating over matrices are presented in appendices.\n", "  This paper is concerned with the asymptotic description of high-frequency\nwaves in locally periodic media. A key issue is that the Bloch-dispersion\ncurves vary with the local microstructure, giving rise to hidden singularities\nassociated with band-gap edges and branch crossings. We describe an asymptotic\napproach for overcoming this difficulty, and take a first step by studying in\ndetail the simplest case of 1D Helmholtz waves. The method entails matching\nadiabatically propagating Bloch waves, captured by a multiple-scale\nWentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) approximation, with complementary\nmultiple-scale solutions spatially localised about dispersion singularities.\nWithin the latter regions the Bloch wavenumber is nearly critical; this allows\ntheir homogenisation, following the method of high-frequency homogenisation\n(HFH), over a naturally arising scale intermediate between the periodicity\n(wavelength) and the macro-scale. Analogously to a classical turning-point\nanalysis, we show that close to a spatial band-gap edge the solution is an Airy\nfunction, only that it is modulated on the short scale by a standing-wave Bloch\neigenfunction. By carrying out the asymptotic matching between the WKB and HFH\nsolutions we provide a detailed description of Bloch-wave reflection from a\nband gap. Finally, we implement the asymptotic theory for a layered medium and\ndemonstrate excellent agreement with numerical computations.\n", "  The Abelian Sandpile Model (ASM) is a paradigm of self-organized criticality\n(SOC) which is related to $c=-2$ conformal field theory. The conformal fields\ncorresponding to some height clusters have been suggested before. Here we\nderive the first corrections to such fields, in a field theoretical approach,\nwhen the lattice parameter is non-vanishing and consider them in the presence\nof a boundary.\n"]}
