This construction is shown to reconstruct\nthose of Batyrev-Borisov, Berglund-H\"ubsch, Givental, and Hori-Vafa. It can be\ndone in more general situations, and provides partial resolutions when the\nabove constructions give a singular mirror. An extended example is given: the\nLandau-Ginzburg models dual to elliptic curves in (P^1)^2 .\n", "  Fractional diffusion equations replace the integer-order derivatives in space\nand time by their fractional-order analogues. They are used in physics to model\nanomalous diffusion. This paper develops strong solutions of space-time\nfractional diffusion equations on bounded domains, as well as probabilistic\nrepresentations of these solutions, which are useful for particle tracking\ncodes.\n", "  The fission Time Projection Chamber (fissionTPC) is a compact (15 cm\ndiameter) two-chamber MICROMEGAS TPC designed to make precision cross section\nmeasurements of neutron-induced fission. The actinide targets are placed on the\ncentral cathode and irradiated with a neutron beam that passes axially through\nthe TPC inducing fission in the target. The 4$\\pi$ acceptance for fission\nfragments and complete charged particle track reconstruction are powerful\nfeatures of the fissionTPC which will be used to measure fission cross sections\nand examine the associated systematic errors. This paper provides a detailed\ndescription of the design requirements, the design solutions, and the initial\nperformance of the fissionTPC.\n", "  The well known Sandpile model of self-organized criticality generates\navalanches of all length and time scales, without tuning any parameters. In the\noriginal models the external drive is randomly selected. Here we investigate a\ndrive which depends on the present state of the system, namely the effect of\nfavoring sites with a certain height in the deposition process. If sites with\nheight three are favored, the system stays in a critical state. Our numerical\nresults indicate the same universality class as the original model with random\ndepositition, although the stationary state is approached very differently. In\nconstrast, when favoring sites with height two, only avalanches which cover the\nentire system occur. Furthermore, we investigate the distributions of sites\nwith a certain height, as well as the transient processes of the different\nvariants of the external drive.\n", "  In this mostly numerical study, we revisit the statistical properties of the\nground state of a directed polymer in a $d=1+1$ \"hilly\" disorder landscape,\ni.e. when the quenched disorder has power-law tails. When disorder is Gaussian,\nthe polymer minimizes its total energy through a collective optimization, where\nthe energy of each visited site only weakly contributes to the total.\nConversely, a hilly landscape forces the polymer to distort and explore a\nlarger portion of space to reach some particularly deep energy sites. As soon\nas the fifth moment of the disorder diverges, this mechanism radically changes\nthe standard \"KPZ\" scaling behaviour of the directed polymer, and new exponents\nprevail. After confirming again that the Flory argument accurately predicts\nthese exponent in the tail-dominated phase, we investigate several other\nstatistical features of the ground state that shed light on this unusual\ntransition and on the accuracy of the Flory argument. We underline the\ntheoretical challenge posed by this situation, which paradoxically becomes even\nmore acute above the upper critical dimension.\n", "  Grand symmetry models in noncommutative geometry have been introduced to\nexplain how to generate minimally (i.e. without adding new fermions) an extra\nscalar field beyond the standard model, which both stabilizes the electroweak\nvacuum and makes the computation of the mass of the Higgs compatible with its\nexperimental value. In this paper, we use Connes-Moscovici twisted spectral\ntriples to cure a technical problem of the grand symmetry, that is the\nappearance together with the extra scalar field of unbounded vectorial terms.\nThe twist makes these terms bounded and - thanks to a twisted version of the\nfirst-order condition that we introduce here - also permits to understand the\nbreaking to the standard model as a dynamical process induced by the spectral\naction. This is a spontaneous breaking from a pre-geometric Pati-Salam model to\nthe almost-commutative geometry of the standard model, with two Higgs-like\nfields: scalar and vector.\n", "  We report density functional theory calculations for Mo$_3$S$_7$(dmit)$_3$.\nWe derive an ab initio tight-binding model from overlaps of Wannier orbitals;\nfinding a layered model with interlayer hopping terms $\\sim3/4$ the size of the\nin-plane terms. The in-plane Hamiltonian interpolates the kagom\\'e and\nhoneycomb lattices. It supports states localized to dodecahedral rings within\nthe plane, which populate one-dimensional (1D) bands and lead to a quasi-1D\nspin-one model on a layered honeycomb lattice once interactions are included.\nTwo lines of Dirac cones also cross the Fermi energy.\n", "  This paper addresses the problem of wellposedness of non-autonomous linear\nevolution equations $\\dot x = A(t)x$ in uniformly convex Banach spaces. We\nassume that $A(t):D \\subset X\\to X$, for each $t$ is the generator of a\nquasi-contractive $C_0$-group where the domain $D$ and the growth exponent are\nindependent of $t$. Well-posedness holds provided that $t\\mapsto A(t)y$ is\nLipschitz for all $y\\in D$. H\\\"older continuity of degree $\\alpha<1$ is not\nsufficient and the assumption of uniform convexity cannot be dropped.\n", "  We calculate the mass and residue of the heavy spin--3/2 negative parity\nbaryons with single heavy bottom or charm quark by the help of a two-point\ncorrelation function. We use the obtained results to investigate the diagonal\nradiative transitions among the baryons under consideration. In particular, we\ncompute corresponding transition form factors via light cone QCD sum rules\nwhich are then used to obtain the magnetic dipole moments of the heavy\nspin--3/2 negative parity baryons. We remove the pollutions coming from the\npositive parity spin--3/2 and positive/negative parity spin--1/2 baryons by\nconstructing sum rules for different Lorentz structures. We compare the results\nobtained with the existing theoretical predictions.\n", "  We prove by means of a renormalization group method that in weakly\ninteracting many-electron systems at half-filling on a periodic hyper-cubic\nlattice, the free energy density uniformly converges to an analytic function of\nthe coupling constants in the infinite-volume, zero-temperature limit if the\nexternal magnetic field has a chessboard-like flux configuration. The spatial\ndimension is allowed to be any number larger than 1. The system covers the\nHubbard model with a nearest-neighbor hopping term, on-site interactions,\nexponentially decaying density-density interactions and exponentially decaying\nspin-spin interactions. The magnetic field must be included in the kinetic term\nby the Peierls substitution. The flux configuration and the sign of the\nnearest-neighbor density-density/spin-spin interactions can be adjusted so that\nthe free energy density is minimum among all the flux configurations.\nConsequently, the minimum free energy density is proved to converge to an\nanalytic function of the coupling constants in the infinite-volume,\nzero-temperature limit. These are extension of the results on a square lattice\nin the preceding work ([Kashima, Y., \"The special issue for the 20th\nanniversary\", J. Math. Sci. Univ. Tokyo. 23 (2016), 1-288]). We refer to lemmas\nproved in the reference in order to complete the proof of the main results of\nthis paper. So this work is a continuation of the preceding work.\n", "  A new ensemble filter that allows for the uncertainty in the prior\ndistribution is proposed and tested. The filter relies on the conditional\nGaussian distribution of the state given the model-error and\npredictability-error covariance matrices. The latter are treated as random\nmatrices and updated in a hierarchical Bayes scheme along with the state. The\n(hyper)prior distribution of the covariance matrices is assumed to be inverse\nWishart. The new Hierarchical Bayes Ensemble Filter (HBEF) assimilates ensemble\nmembers as generalized observations and allows ordinary observations to\ninfluence the covariances. The actual probability distribution of the ensemble\nmembers is allowed to be different from the true one. An approximation that\nleads to a practicable analysis algorithm is proposed. The new filter is\nstudied in numerical experiments with a doubly stochastic one-variable model of\n\"truth\". The model permits the assessment of the variance of the truth and the\ntrue filtering error variance at each time instance. The HBEF is shown to\noutperform the EnKF and the HEnKF by Myrseth and Omre (2010) in a wide range of\nfiltering regimes in terms of performance of its primary and secondary filter.\n", "  We introduce a new class of two dimensional conformal field theories by\nextending Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) models to chiral algebras with matrix-valued\nlevels. The new CFTs are based on holomorphic currents with an operator product\nexpansion characterized by a positive integer-valued matrix $K_{AB}$. We use\nthe Sugawara construction to compute the energy-momentum tensor, the central\ncharge, and the spectrum of conformal dimensions of the CFTs based on this\nalgebra. We also construct a set of genus-$1$ characters and show that they\nfulfil a representation of the modular group $\\text{SL}(2,\\mathbb{Z})$ up to a\nmodular anomaly.\n", "  We develop the Riemann-Hilbert problem approach to inverse scattering for the\ntwo-dimensional Schrodinger equation at fixed energy. We obtain global or\ngeneric versions of the key results of this approach for the case of positive\nenergy and compactly supported potentials. In particular, we do not assume that\nthe potential is small or that Faddeev scattering solutions do not have\nsingularities (i.e. we allow the Faddeev exceptional points to exist).\nApplications of these results to the Novikov-Veselov equation are also\nconsidered.\n", "  The light flicker problem of high intensity discharge lamps is studied\nnumerically and experimentally. It is shown that in some respects the systems\nbehaves very similar to the forced Duffing oscillator with a softening spring.\nIn particular, the jump phenomenon and hysteresis are observed in the\nsimulations and in the experiments.\n", "  Brownian motion of a heavy charged particle at zero and small (but finite)\ntemperature is studied in presence of finite density. We are primarily\ninterested in the dynamics at (near) zero temperature which is holographically\ndescribed by motion of a fundamental string in an (near-) extremal\nReissner-Nordstr$\\ddot{\\text{o}}$m black hole. We analytically compute the\nfunctional form of retarded Green's function for small frequencies and extract\nthe dissipative behavior at and near zero temperature.\n", "  We apply methods of the so-called `inverse problem of the calculus of\nvariations' to the stabilization of an equilibrium of a class of\ntwo-dimensional controlled mechanical systems. The class is general enough to\ninclude, among others, the inverted pendulum on a cart and the inertia wheel\npendulum. By making use of a condition that follows from Douglas'\nclassification, we derive feedback controls for which the control system is\nvariational. We then use the energy of a suitable controlled Lagrangian to\nprovide a stability criterion for the equilibrium.\n", "  We study the role of systematic effects in observational studies of the\ncusp-core problem under the minimum disc approximation using a suite of\nhigh-resolution (25-pc softening length) hydrodynamical simulations of dwarf\ngalaxies. We mimic realistic kinematic observations and fit the mock rotation\ncurves with two analytic models commonly used to differentiate cores from cusps\nin the dark matter distribution. We find that the cored pseudo-isothermal\nsphere (ISO) model is strongly favoured by the reduced $\\chi^2_\\nu$ of the fits\nin spite of the fact that our simulations contain cuspy Navarro-Frenk-White\nprofiles (NFW). We show that even idealized measurements of the gas circular\nmotions can lead to the incorrect answer if velocity underestimates induced by\npressure support, with a typical size of order $\\sim$5 km s$^{-1}$ in the\ncentral kiloparsec, are neglected. Increasing the spatial resolution of the\nmock observations leads to more misleading results because the inner region,\nwhere the effect of pressure support is most significant, is better sampled.\nFits to observations with a spatial resolution of 100 pc (2 arcsec at 10 Mpc)\nfavour the ISO model in 78-90 per cent of the cases, while at 800-pc\nresolution, 40-78 per cent of the galaxies indicate the fictitious presence of\na dark matter core. The coefficients of our best-fit models agree well with\nthose reported in observational studies; therefore, we conclude that NFW haloes\ncan not be ruled out reliably from this type of analysis.\n", "  Pulsed lasers operating in the 2-5 {\\mu}m band are important for a wide range\nof applications in sensing, spectroscopy, imaging and communications. Despite\nrecent advances with mid-infrared gain media, the lack of a capable pulse\ngeneration mechanism, i.e. a passive optical switch, remains a significant\ntechnological challenge. Here we show that mid-infrared optical response of\nDirac states in crystalline Cd3As2, a three-dimensional topological Dirac\nsemimetal (TDS), constitutes an ideal ultrafast optical switching mechanism for\nthe 2-5 {\\mu}m range. Significantly, fundamental aspects of the photocarrier\nprocesses, such as relaxation time scales, are found to be flexibly controlled\nthrough element doping, a feature crucial for the development of convenient\nmid-infrared ultrafast sources. Although various exotic physical phenomena have\nbeen uncovered in three-dimensional TDS systems, our findings show for the\nfirst time that this emerging class of quantum materials can be harnessed to\nfill a long known gap in the field of photonics.\n", "  We study the effects of a controlled gas flow on the dynamics of electrified\njets in the electrospinning process. The main idea is to model the air drag\neffects of the gas flow by using a non-linear Langevin-like approach. The model\nis employed to investigate the dynamics of electrified polymer jets at\ndifferent conditions of air drag force, showing that a controlled gas\ncounterflow can lead to a decrease of the average diameter of electrospun\nfibers, and potentially to an improvement of the quality of electrospun\nproducts. We probe the influence of air drag effects on the bending\ninstabilities of the jet and on its angular fluctuations during the process.\nThe insights provided by this study might prove useful for the design of future\nelectrospinning experiments and polymer nanofiber materials.\n", "  We present an improved method of targeting continuous gravitational-wave\nsignals in data from the LIGO and Virgo detectors with a higher efficiency than\nthe time-domain Bayesian pipeline used in many previous searches. Our spectral\ninterpolation algorithm, SplInter, removes the intrinsic phase evolution of the\nsignal from source rotation and relative detector motion. We do this in the\nfrequency domain and generate a time series containing only variations in the\nsignal due to the antenna pattern. Although less flexible than the classic\nheterodyne approach, SplInter allows for rapid analysis of putative signals\nfrom isolated (and some binary) pulsars, and efficient follow-up searches for\ncandidate signals generated by other search methods. The computational saving\nover the heterodyne approach can be many orders of magnitude, up to a factor of\naround fifty thousand in some cases, with a minimal impact on overall\nsensitivity for most targets.\n", "  We review the recent progress in our understanding of the Blazhko effect in\nRR Lyrae stars.\n", "  Non-centrosymmetric superconductors, whose crystal structure is absent of\ninversion symmetry, have recently received special attentions due to the\nexpectation of unconventional pairings and exotic physics associated with such\npairings. The newly discovered superconductors A2Cr3As3 (A=K, Rb), featured by\nthe quasi-one dimensional structure with conducting CrAs chains, belongs to\nsuch kind of superconductor. In this study, we are the first to report the\nfinding that the superconductivity of A2Cr3As3 (A=K, Rb) has a positive\ncorrelation with the extent of non-centrosymmetry. Our in-situ high pressure ac\nsusceptibility and synchrotron x-ray diffraction measurements reveal that the\nlarger bond angle of As-Cr-As in the CrAs chains can be taken as a key factor\ncontrolling superconductivity. While the smaller bond angle and the distance\nbetween the CrAs chains also affect the superconductivity due to their\nstructural connections with the angle. We find that the larger value of the\ndifference between the larger and samller angles, which is associated with the\nextent of the non-centrosymmetry of the lattice structure, is in favor of\nsuperconductivity. These results are expected to shed a new light on the\nunderlying mechanism of the superconductivity in these Q1D superconductors and\nalso to provide new perspective in understanding other non-centrosymmetric\nsuperconductors.\n", "  We demonstrate that the observation of old strange quark stars (SQSs) can set\nimportant limits on the scattering cross sections $\\sigma_q$ between the light\nquarks and the non-interacting scalar dark matter (DM). By analyzing a set of\n1403 of solitary pulsarlike compact stars in the Milky Way, we find the old\nsolitary pulsar PSR J1801-0857D can set the most stringent upper limits on\n$\\sigma_q$ or the DM-proton scattering cross sections $\\sigma_p$. By converting\n$\\sigma_q$ into $\\sigma_p$ based on effective operator analyses, we show the\nresulting $\\sigma_p$ limit by assuming PSR J1801-0857D to be a SQS could be\ncomparable with that of the current direct detection experiments but much\nweaker (by several orders of magnitude) than that obtained by assuming PSR\nJ1801-0857D to be a neutron star (NS), which requires an extremely small\n$\\sigma_p$ far beyond the limits of direct detection experiments. Our findings\nimply that the old pulsars are favored to be SQSs rather than NSs if the scalar\nDM were observed by future terrestrial experiments.\n", "  We demonstrate theoretically that shining light on superconducting proximity\nstructures controls the minigap and triplet proximity effect in normal and\nmagnetic metals, respectively. Considering both a bilayer and Josephson\njunction geometry, we show that microwave irradiation with frequency $\\omega$\nqualitatively alters the spectral properties of the system, controlling the\nminigap size $E_\\text{mg}$ and even replacing the minigap with a strong peak of\nquasiparticle accumulation at zero energy when $\\omega=E_\\text{mg}$. The\ninteraction between light and Cooper pairs may thus open a route to active\ncontrol of quantum coherent phenomena in superconducting proximity structures.\n", "  The response of inertial particle detectors coupled to a scalar field\nsatisfying nonlocal dynamics described by nonanalytic functions of the\nd'Alembertian operator $\\Box$ is studied. We show that spontaneous emission\nprocesses of a low energy particle detector are very sensitive to high-energy\nnonlocality scales. This allows us to suggest a nuclear physics experiment\n($\\sim$ MeV energy scales) that outperforms the sensitivity of LHC experiments\nby many orders of magnitude. This may have implications for the falsifiability\nof theoretical proposals of quantum gravity.\n", "  In this paper we carry out a low-temperature scan of the phase diagram of\ndense two-color QCD with $N_f=2$ quarks. The study is conducted using lattice\nsimulation with rooted staggered quarks. At small chemical potential we observe\nthe hadronic phase, where the theory is in a confining state, chiral symmetry\nis broken, the baryon density is zero and there is no diquark condensate. At\nthe critical point $\\mu = m_{\\pi}/2$ we observe the expected second order\ntransition to Bose-Einstein condensation of scalar diquarks. In this phase the\nsystem is still in confinement in conjunction with non-zero baryon density, but\nthe chiral symmetry is restored in the chiral limit. We have also found that in\nthe first two phases the system is well described by chiral perturbation\ntheory. For larger values of the chemical potential the system turns into\nanother phase, where the relevant degrees of freedom are fermions residing\ninside the Fermi sphere, and the diquark condensation takes place on the Fermi\nsurface. In this phase the system is still in confinement, chiral symmetry is\nrestored and the system is very similar to the quarkyonic state predicted by\nSU($N_c$) theory at large $N_c$.\n", "  We report on a method for measuring the branching ratios of dipole\ntransitions of trapped atomic ions by performing nested sequences of population\ninversions. This scheme is broadly applicable and does not use ultrafast pulsed\nor narrow linewidth lasers. It is simple to perform and insensitive to\nexperimental variables such as laser and magnetic field noise as well as ion\nheating. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we make the most accurate\nmeasurements thus far of the branching ratios of both 5P1/2 and 5P3/2 states in\n88Sr+ with sub-1% uncertainties. We measure 17.175(27) for the branching ratio\nof 5P1/2-5S1/2, 15.845(71) for 5P3/2-5S1/2, and 0.05609(21) for 5P3/2-4D5/2,\nten- fold and thirty-fold improvements in precision for 5P1/2 and 5P3/2\nbranching ratios respectively over the best previous experimental values.\n", "  Despite fundamentally challenging in integrated (nano)photonics, achieving\nchip-based light nonreciprocity becomes increasingly urgent in signal\nprocessing and optical communications. Because of material incompatibilities in\nconventional approaches based on Faraday effects, alternative solutions have\nresorted to nonlinear processes to obtain one-way transmission. However,\nrevealed dynamic reciprocity in a recent theoretical analysis has pinned down\nthe functionalities of these nonlinear isolators. To overcome this dynamic\nreciprocity, we here report the first demonstration of a nonlinear optical\nisolator on a silicon chip enforced by phase-matched parametric amplification.\nUsing a high-Q microtoroid resonator, we realize highly nonreciprocal transport\nat the 1,550 nm wavelength when waves are simultaneously launched in both\nforward and backward directions. Our design, compatible with current CMOS\ntechnique, yields convincing isolation performance with sufficiently low\ninsertion loss for a wide range of input power levels. Moreover, our work\nevidences the possibility of designing chip-based real nonlinear isolators for\ninformation processing and laser protection.\n", "  We present a feasibility study, to search for dark matter at the LHC, in\nevents with one soft hadronically decaying tau lepton and missing transverse\nenergy recoiling against a hard $p_{T}$ jet from initial state radiation. This\nmethodology allows the search for Supersymmetry in compressed mass spectra\nregions, where the mass difference between the lightest neutralino,\n$\\tilde\\chi_1^0$, and the stau (the tau superpartner), $\\tilde{\\tau}$, is\nsmall. Several theoretical models predict a direct connection between thermal\nBino dark matter and staus within this scenario. We show that compressed\nregions, not excluded by ATLAS nor CMS experiments, are opened up with the\nincrease in experimental sensitivity reached with the proposed methodology. The\nrequirement of a hard jet from initial state radiation combined with a soft tau\nlepton is effective in reducing Standard Model backgrounds, providing expected\nsignificances greater than 3$\\sigma$ for $\\tilde{\\chi}_{1}^{\\pm}$ masses up to\n300 GeV and $\\tilde{\\tau}$-$\\tilde{\\chi}_{1}^{0}$ mass gaps below 25 GeV with\nonly 30 fb$^{-1}$ of 13 TeV data from the LHC.\n", "  The understanding of disorder has profoundly influenced the development of\ncondensed matter physics, explaining such fundamental effects as, for example,\nthe transition from ballistic to diffusive propagation, and the presence of\nquantized steps in the quantum Hall effect. For superconductors, the response\nto disorder reveals crucial information about the internal gap symmetries of\nthe condensate, and thereby the pairing mechanism itself. The destruction of\nsuperconductivity by disorder is traditionally described by Abrikosov-Gor'kov\n(AG) theory, which however ignores spatial modulations and ceases to be valid\nwhen impurities interfere, and interactions become important. Here we study the\neffects of disorder on unconventional superconductors in the presence of\ncorrelations, and explore a completely different disorder paradigm dominated by\nstrong deviations from standard AG theory due to generation of local bound\nstates and cooperative impurity behavior driven by Coulomb interactions.\nSpecifically we explain under which circumstances magnetic disorder acts as a\nstrong poison destroying high-Tc superconductivity at the sub-1% level, and\nwhen non-magnetic disorder, counter-intuitively, hardly affects the\nunconventional superconducting state while concomitantly inducing an\ninhomogeneous full-volume magnetic phase. Recent experimental studies of\nFe-based superconductors have discovered that such unusual disorder behavior\nseem to be indeed present in those systems.\n", "  Hot electron effects in graphene are significant because of graphene's small\nelectronic heat capacity and weak electron-phonon coupling, yet the dynamics\nand cooling mechanisms of hot electrons in graphene are not completely\nunderstood. We describe a novel photocurrent spectroscopy method that uses the\nmixing of continuous-wave lasers in a graphene photothermal detector to measure\nthe frequency dependence and nonlinearity of hot-electron cooling in graphene\nas a function of the carrier concentration and temperature. The method offers\nunparalleled sensitivity to the nonlinearity, and probes the ultrafast cooling\nof hot carriers with an optical fluence that is orders of magnitude smaller\nthan in conventional time-domain methods, allowing for accurate\ncharacterization of electron-phonon cooling near charge neutrality. Our\nmeasurements reveal that near the charge neutral-point the nonlinear power\ndependence of the electron cooling is dominated by disorder-assisted\ncollisions, while at higher carrier concentrations conventional\nmomentum-conserving cooling prevails in the nonlinear dependence. The relative\ncontribution of these competing mechanisms can be electrostatically tuned\nthrough the application of a gate voltage -- an effect that is unique to\ngraphene.\n", "  The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate a new method of generating exact\nsolutions to the Einstein's equations obtained by the Hamiltonian reduction.\nThe key element to the successful Hamiltonian reduction is finding the\nprivileged spacetime coordinates in which physical degrees of freedom\nmanifestly reside in the conformal two-metric, and all the other metric\ncomponents are determined by the conformal two-metric. In the privileged\ncoordinates the Einstein's constraint equations become trivial; the Hamiltonian\nand momentum constraints are simply the defining equations of a non-vanishing\ngravitational Hamiltonian and momentum densities in terms of conformal\ntwo-metric and its conjugate momentum, respectively. Thus, given any conformal\ntwo-metric, which is a constraint-free data, one can construct the whole\n4-dimensional spacetime by integrating the first-order superpotential\nequations. As the first examples of using Hamiltonian reduction in solving the\nEinstein's equations, we found two exact solutions to the Einstein's equations\nin the privileged coordinates. Suitable coordinate transformations from the\nprivileged to the standard coordinates show that they are just the\nEinstein-Rosen wave and the Schwarzschild solution. The local gravitational\nHamiltonian and momentum densities of these spacetimes are also presented in\nthe privileged coordinates.\n", "  We investigate the correlations in galaxy shapes between optical and radio\nwavelengths using archival observations of the COSMOS field. Cross-correlation\nstudies between different wavebands will become increasingly important for\nprecision cosmology as future large surveys may be dominated by systematic\nrather than statistical errors. In the case of weak lensing, galaxy shapes must\nbe measured to extraordinary accuracy (shear systematics of $< 0.01\\%$) in\norder to achieve good constraints on dark energy parameters. By using shape\ninformation from overlapping surveys in optical and radio bands, robustness to\nsystematics may be significantly improved without loss of constraining power.\nHere we use HST-ACS optical data, VLA radio data, and extensive simulations to\ninvestigate both our ability to make precision measurements of source shapes\nfrom realistic radio data, and to constrain the intrinsic astrophysical scatter\nbetween the shapes of galaxies as measured in the optical and radio wavebands.\nBy producing a new image from the VLA-COSMOS L-band radio visibility data that\nis well suited to galaxy shape measurements, we are able to extract precise\nmeasurements of galaxy position angles. Comparing to corresponding measurements\nfrom the HST optical image, we set a lower limit on the intrinsic astrophysical\nscatter in position angles, between the optical and radio bands, of\n$\\sigma_\\alpha > 0.212\\pi$ radians (or $38.2^{\\circ}$) at a $95\\%$ confidence\nlevel.\n", "  It has become apparent in recent years that it is important, notably for a\nrange of physics studies at the Large Hadron Collider, to have accurate\nknowledge on the distribution of photons in the proton. We show how the photon\nparton distribution function (PDF) can be determined in a model-independent\nmanner, using electron-proton ($ep$) scattering data, in effect viewing the\n$ep\\to e+X$ process as an electron scattering off the photon field of the\nproton. To this end, we consider an imaginary, beyond Standard Model process\nwith a flavour changing photon-lepton vertex. We write its cross section in two\nways, one in terms of proton structure functions, the other in terms of a\nphoton distribution. Requiring their equivalence yields the photon distribution\nas an integral over proton structure functions. As a result of the good\nprecision of $ep$ data, we constrain the photon PDF at the level of 1-2% over a\nwide range of momentum fractions.\n", "  The communication networks in real world often couple with each other to save\ncosts, which results in any network does not have a stand-alone function and\nefficiency. To investigate this, in this paper we propose a transportation\nmodel on two coupled networks with bandwidth sharing. We find that the\nfree-flow state and the congestion state can coexist in the two coupled\nnetworks, and the free-flow path and congestion path can coexist in each\nnetwork. Considering three bandwidth-sharing mechanisms, random, assortative\nand disassortative couplings, we also find that the transportation capacity of\nthe network only depends on the coupling mechanism, and the fraction of coupled\nlinks only affects the performance of the system in the congestion state, such\nas the traveling time. In addition, with assortative coupling, the\ntransportation capacity of the system will decrease significantly. However, the\ndisassortative coupling has little influence on the transportation capacity of\nthe system, which provides a good strategy to save bandwidth. Furthermore, a\ntheoretical method is developed to obtain the bandwidth usage of each link,\nbased on which we can obtain the congestion transition point exactly.\n", "  The Weyl semimetal exhibits various interesting physical phenomena because of\nthe Weyl points, i.e., linear band-crossings. We show by Floquet theory that a\nlinearly polarized light applied to a band insulator can induce controllable\nWeyl points. In a tight-binding model, we classify different types of\nphotoinduced Weyl points that lead to a rich phase diagram characterized by the\nChern number defined on each momentum slices of the bulk states. Taking account\nof the nonequilibrium electron distribution, we calculate and explain the\nnonmonotonous anomalous Hall conductivity in terms of the light frequency\ncontrolled shift of Weyl points' position, which also allows us to examine the\nconductivity's dependence on the driving electric field.\n", "  Motivated by experimental realizations of integer quantized charge pumping in\none-dimensional superlattices~[Nat. Phys. 12, 350 (2016); Nat. Phys. 12, 296\n(2016)], we generalize and propose the adiabatic pumping of a fractionalized\ncharge in interacting bosonic systems. This is achieved by dynamically sweeping\nthe modulated potential in a class of one-dimensional interacting systems. As\nconcrete examples, we show the charge pumping of interacting bosons at certain\nfractionally occupied fillings. We find that, for a given ground state, the\ncharge pumping in a complete potential cycle is quantized to the fractional\nvalue related to the corresponding Chern number, characterized by the motion of\nthe charge polarization per site. Moreover, the difference between charge\npolarizations of two ground states is quantized to an intrinsic constant\nrevealing the fractional elementary charge of quasiparticle.\n", "  We investigate the real-time evolution of lattice bosons in two spatial\ndimensions whose dynamics is governed by a Markovian quantum master equation.\nWe employ the Wigner-Weyl phase space quantization and derive the functional\nintegral for open quantum many-body systems that governs the time evolution of\nthe Wigner function. Using the truncated Wigner approximation, in which quantum\nfluctuations are only taken into account in the initial state whereas the\ndynamics is governed by classical evolution equations, we study the buildup of\nlong-range correlations due to the action of non-Hermitean quantum jump\noperators that constitute a mechanism for dissipative cooling. Starting from an\ninitially disordered state corresponding to a vortex condensate, the\ndissipative process results in the annihilation of vortex-antivortex pairs and\nthe establishment of quasi long-range order at late times. We observe that a\nfinite vortex density survives the cooling process which disagrees with the\nanalytically constructed vortex-free Bose-Einstein condensate at asymptotic\ntimes. This indicates that quantum fluctuations beyond the truncated Wigner\napproximation need to be included to fully capture the physics of dissipative\nBose-Einstein condensation.\n", "  Regardless of the long history of gauge theories, it is not well recognized\nunder which condition gauge fixing at the action level is legitimate. We\naddress this issue from the Lagrangian point of view, and prove the following\ntheorem on the relation between gauge fixing and Euler-Lagrange equations: In\nany gauge theory, if a gauge fixing is complete, i.e., the gauge functions are\ndetermined uniquely by the gauge conditions, the Euler-Lagrange equations\nderived from the gauge-fixed action are equivalent to those derived from the\noriginal action supplemented with the gauge conditions. Otherwise, it is not\nappropriate to impose the gauge conditions before deriving Euler-Lagrange\nequations as it may in general lead to inconsistent results. The criterion to\ncheck whether a gauge fixing is complete or not is further investigated. We\nalso provide applications of the theorem to scalar-tensor theories and make\ncomments on recent relevant papers on theories of modified gravity, in which\nthere are confusions on gauge fixing and counting physical degrees of freedom.\n", "  We investigate a gauge extension of the Standard Model in light of the\nobserved hints of lepton universality violation in $b \\to c \\ell \\nu$ and $b\n\\to s \\ell^+ \\ell^-$ decays at BaBar, Belle and LHCb. The model consists of an\nextended gauge group $\\mathrm{SU(2)}_{1} \\times \\mathrm{SU(2)}_{2} \\times\n\\mathrm{U(1)}_Y$ which breaks spontaneously around the TeV scale to the\nelectroweak gauge group. Fermion mixing effects with vector-like fermions give\nrise to potentially large new physics contributions in flavour transitions\nmediated by $W^{\\prime}$ and $Z^{\\prime}$ bosons. This model can ease tensions\nin $B$-physics data while satisfying stringent bounds from flavour physics, tau\ndecays, and electroweak precision data. Possible ways to test the proposed new\nphysics scenario with upcoming experimental measurements are discussed. Among\nother predictions, the lepton flavour violating ratios $R_M$, with $M = K^*,\n\\phi$, are found to be reduced with respect to the Standard Model expectation\n$R_M \\simeq 1$.\n", "  We study the dynamics of a spin-1/2 particle interacting with a multi-spin\nenvironment, modelling the corresponding open system dynamics through a\ncollision-based model. The environmental particles are prepared in individual\nthermal states, and we investigate the effects of a distribution of\ntemperatures across the spin environment on the evolution of the system,\nparticularly how thermalisation in the long-time limit is affected. %We also\naddress the conditions under which the system reaches a stationary state, with\nparticular attention to whether homogenization to the average environmental\nstate occurs. We study the phenomenology of the heat exchange between system\nand environment and consider the information-to-energy conversion process,\ninduced by the system-environment interaction and embodied by the Landauer\nprinciple. Furthermore, by considering an interacting-particles environment, we\ntune the dynamics of the system from an explicit Markovian evolution up to a\nstrongly non-Markovian one, investigating the connections between\nnon-Markovianity, the establishment of system-environment correlations, and the\nbreakdown of the validity of Landauer principle.\n", "  In this note we study the connected prescription, originally derived from\nWitten's twistor string theory, for tree-level form factors in ${\\cal N}=4$\nsuper-Yang-Mills theory. The construction is based on the recently proposed\nfour-dimensional scattering equations with $n$ massless on-shell states and one\noff-shell state, which we expect to work for form factors of general operators.\nTo illustrate the universality of the prescription, we propose compact formulas\nfor super form factors with chiral stress-tensor multiplet operator, and\nbosonic ones with scalar operators ${\\rm Tr}(\\phi^m)$ for arbitrary $m$.\n", "  We describe the development and implementation of a light-weight, fully\nautonomous 2-axis pointing and stabilization system designed for balloon-borne\nastronomical payloads. The system is developed using off-the-shelf components\nsuch as Arduino Uno controller, HMC 5883L magnetometer, MPU-9150 Inertial\nMeasurement Unit (IMU) and iWave GPS receiver unit. It is a compact and rugged\nsystem which can also be used to take images/video in a moving vehicle, or in\nareal photography. The system performance is evaluated from the ground, as well\nas in conditions simulated to imitate the actual flight by using a tethered\nlaunch.\n", "  We have searched for the signature of cosmic voids in the CMB, in both the\nPlanck temperature and lensing-convergence maps; voids should give decrements\nin both. We use zobov voids from the DR12 SDSS CMASS galaxy sample. We base our\nanalysis on N-body simulations, to avoid a posteriori bias. For the first time,\nwe detect the signature of voids in CMB lensing: the significance is\n$3.2\\sigma$, close to $\\Lambda$CDM in both amplitude and projected\ndensity-profile shape. A temperature dip is also seen, at modest significance\n($2.3\\sigma$), with amplitude about 6 times the prediction. This temperature\nsignal is induced mostly by voids with radius between 100 and 150 Mpc/h, while\nthe lensing signal is mostly contributed by smaller voids -- as expected;\nlensing relates directly to density, while ISW depends on gravitational\npotential. The void abundance in observations and simulations agree, as well.\nWe also repeated the analysis excluding lower-significance voids: no lensing\nsignal is detected, with an upper limit of about twice the $\\Lambda$CDM\nprediction. But the mean temperature decrement now becomes non-zero at the\n$3.7\\sigma$ level (similar to that found by Granett et al.), with amplitude\nabout 20 times the prediction. However, the observed dependence of temperature\non void size is in poor agreement with simulations, whereas the lensing results\nare consistent with $\\Lambda$CDM theory. Thus, the overall tension between\ntheory and observations does not favour non-standard theories of gravity,\ndespite the hints of an enhanced amplitude for the ISW effect from voids.\n", "  The Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO) is a large and high\nprecision liquid scintillator detector under construction in the south of\nChina. With its 20 kt target mass, it aims to achieve an unprecedented 3%\nenergy resolution at 1 MeV. Its main goal is to study the disappearance of\nreactor antineutrino to determine the neutrino mass ordering, and to precisely\nmeasure the mixing parameters $\\theta_{12}$, $\\Delta m^2_{12}$, and $\\Delta m\n^2_{ee}$. It also aims to detect neutrinos emitted from radioactive processes\ntaking place within the inner layers of the Earth (geoneutrinos), as well as\nneutrinos produced during rare supernova bursts. Neutrinos emitted in solar\nnuclear reactions could also be observed, if stringent radiopurity requirements\non the scintillator are met. This manuscript provides some highlights of JUNO's\nPhysics Programme, and describes the detector design, as well as the ongoing\ndetector R&D.\n", "  We demonstrate coincidence measurements of spatially entangled photons by\nmeans of a novel type of multi-pixel based detection array. The adopted sensor\nis a fully digital 8$\\times$16 silicon photomultiplier array allowing not only\nphoton counting but also per-pixel time stamping of the arrived photons with a\nresolution of 65 ps. Together with a frame rate of 500 kfps, this property\nexceeds the capabilities of conventional charge-coupled device cameras which\nhave become of growing interest for the detection of transversely correlated\nphoton pairs. The sensor is used to measure a second-order correlation function\nfor various non-collinear configurations of entangled photons generated by\nspontaneous parametric down-conversion. The experimental results are compared\nto theory.\n", "  Pixel Array Detectors (PADs) consist of an x-ray sensor layer bonded\npixel-by-pixel to an underlying readout chip. This approach allows both the\nsensor and the custom pixel electronics to be tailored independently to best\nmatch the x-ray imaging requirements. Here we present characterizations of CdTe\nsensors hybridized with two different charge-integrating readout chips, the\nKeck PAD and the Mixed-Mode PAD (MM-PAD), both developed previously in our\nlaboratory. The charge-integrating architecture of each of these PADs extends\nthe instantaneous counting rate by many orders of magnitude beyond that\nobtainable with photon counting architectures. The Keck PAD chip consists of\nrapid, 8-frame, in-pixel storage elements with framing periods $<$150 ns. The\nsecond detector, the MM-PAD, has an extended dynamic range by utilizing an\nin-pixel overflow counter coupled with charge removal circuitry activated at\neach overflow. This allows the recording of signals from the single-photon\nlevel to tens of millions of x-rays/pixel/frame while framing at 1 kHz. Both\ndetector chips consist of a 128$\\times$128 pixel array with (150 $\\mu$m)$^2$\npixels.\n", "  We develop the high frequency expansion based on the Brillouin-Wigner (B-W)\nperturbation theory for driven systems with spin-orbit coupling which is\napplicable to the cases of silicene, germanene and stanene. We compute the\neffective Hamiltonian in the zero photon subspace not only to order\n$O(\\omega^{-1})$, but by keeping all the important terms to order\n$O(\\omega^{-2})$, and obtain the photo-assisted correction terms to both the\nhopping and the spin-orbit terms, as well as new longer ranged hopping terms.\nWe then use the effective static Hamiltonian to compute the phase diagram in\nthe high frequency limit and compare it with the results of direct numerical\ncomputation of the Chern numbers of the Floquet bands, and show that at\nsufficiently large frequencies, the B-W theory high frequency expansion works\nwell even in the presence of spin-orbit coupling terms.\n", "  Young and rapidly rotating stars are known for intense, dynamo generated\nmagnetic fields. Spectropolarimetric observations of those stars in precisely\naged clusters are key input for gyrochronology and magnetochronology. We use\nZDI maps of several young K-type stars of similar mass and radius but with\nvarious ages and rotational periods, to perform 3D numerical MHD simulations of\ntheir coronae and follow the evolution of their magnetic properties with age.\nThose simulations yield the coronal structure as well as the instant torque\nexerted by the magnetized, rotating wind on the star. As stars get older, we\nfind that the angular momentum loss decreases with $\\Omega^3$, which is the\nreason for the convergence on the Skumanich law. For the youngest stars of our\nsample, the angular momentum loss show signs of saturation around\n$8\\Omega_{\\odot}$, which is a common value used in spin evolution models for\nK-type stars. We compare these results to semi-analytical models and existing\nbraking laws. We observe a complex wind speed distribution for the youngest\nstars with slow, intermediate and fast wind components, which are the result of\nthe interaction with intense and non axisymmetric magnetic fields.\nConsequently, in our simulations, the stellar wind structure in the equatorial\nplane of young stars varies significantly from a solar configuration,\ndelivering insight about the past of the solar system interplanetary medium.\n", "  The Coulomb and Higgs branches of certain 3d N=4 gauge theories can be\nunderstood as closures of nilpotent orbits. Recently, a new theorem by Namikawa\nsuggests that this is the simplest possible case, thus giving this class a\nspecial role. In this note we use branes to reproduce the mathematical work by\nKraft and Procesi. It studies the classification of all nilpotent orbits for\nclassical groups and it characterizes an inclusion relation via minimal\nsingularities. We show how these minimal singularities arise naturally in the\nType IIB superstring embedding of the 3d A-type theories. The Higgs mechanism\ncan be used to remove the minimal singularity, corresponding to a transition in\nthe brane configuration that induces a new effective 3d theory. This reproduces\nthe Kraft-Procesi results, endowing the family of gauge theories with a new\nunderlying structure. We provide an efficient procedure for computing such\nbrane transitions.\n", "  We study an impurity atom trapped by an anharmonic potential, immersed within\na cold atomic Fermi gas with attractive interactions that realizes the\ncrossover from a Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) superfluid to a Bose-Einstein\ncondensate (BEC). Considering the qubit comprising the lowest two vibrational\nenergy eigenstates of the impurity, we demonstrate that its dynamics probes the\nequilibrium density fluctuations encoded in the dynamic structure factor of the\nsuperfluid. Observing the impurity's evolution is thus shown to facilitate\nnondestructive measurements of the superfluid order parameter and the contact\nbetween collective and single-particle excitation spectra. Our setup\nconstitutes a novel model of an open quantum system interacting with a thermal\nreservoir, the latter supporting both bosonic and fermionic excitations that\nare also coupled to each other.\n", "  The precision of photometric and spectroscopic observations has been\nsystematically improved in the last decade, mostly thanks to space-borne\nphotometric missions and ground-based spectrographs dedicated to finding\nexoplanets. The field of eclipsing binary stars strongly benefited from this\ndevelopment. Eclipsing binaries serve as critical tools for determining\nfundamental stellar properties (masses, radii, temperatures and luminosities),\nyet the models are not capable of reproducing observed data well either because\nof the missing physics or because of insufficient precision. This led to a\npredicament where radiative and dynamical effects, insofar buried in noise,\nstarted showing up routinely in the data, but were not accounted for in the\nmodels. PHOEBE (PHysics Of Eclipsing BinariEs; http://phoebe-project.org) is an\nopen source modeling code for computing theoretical light and radial velocity\ncurves that addresses both problems by incorporating missing physics and by\nincreasing the computational fidelity. In particular, we discuss triangulation\nas a superior surface discretization algorithm, meshing of rotating single\nstars, light time travel effect, advanced phase computation, volume\nconservation in eccentric orbits, and improved computation of local intensity\nacross the stellar surfaces that includes photon-weighted mode, enhanced limb\ndarkening treatment, better reflection treatment and Doppler boosting. Here we\npresent the concepts on which PHOEBE is built on and proofs of concept that\ndemonstrate the increased model fidelity.\n", "  We study the Kaluza-Klein dimensional reduction of the Lovelock-Cartan theory\nin five-dimensional spacetime, with a compact dimension of $S^1$ topology. We\nfind cosmological solutions of the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker class in the\nreduced spacetime. The torsion and the fields arising from the dimensional\nreduction induce a nonvanishing energy-momentum tensor in four dimensions. We\nfind solutions describing expanding, contracting and bouncing universes. The\nmodel shows a dynamical compactification of the extra dimension in some regions\nof the parameter space.\n", "  We present an algebraic solution for the Susceptible-Infective-Removed (SIR)\nmodel originally presented by Kermack-McKendrick in 1927. Starting from the\ndifferential equation for the removed subjects presented by them in the\noriginal paper, we re-write it in a slightly different form in order to derive\nformally the solution, unless one integration. Then, using algebraic techniques\nand some well justified numerical assumptions we obtain an analytic solution\nfor the integral. Finally, we compare the numerical solution of the\ndifferential equations of the SIR model with the analytically solution here\nproposed, showing an excellent agreement.\n", "  The paper presents cross sections for collisions of neutral atoms/molecules\nwith a charged nanoparticle, which is the source of the dipole potential. The\naccuracy of the orbital limited motion (OLM) approximation is estimated. It is\nshown that simple analytical formulas for the atoms/molecules and heat fluxes,\nobtained in the OLM approximation, give an error of not more than 15%, and are\napplicable in all reasonable range of nanoparticles and weakly ionized plasma\nparameters.\n", "  We calculate the trace anomaly of a Weyl fermion coupled to gravity by using\nFujikawa's method supplemented by the choice of a consistent regulator. The\nlatter is constructed out of Pauli-Villars regulating fields. The motivation\nfor presenting such a calculation stems from recent studies that suggest that\nthe trace anomaly of chiral fermions in four dimensions might contain an\nimaginary part proportional to the Pontryagin density. We find that the trace\nanomaly of a Weyl fermion is given by half the trace anomaly of a Dirac\nfermion, so that no imaginary part proportional to the Pontryagin density is\nseen to arise.\n", "  We present a detailed temperature and frequency dependence of the optical\nconductivity measured on clean high quality single crystals of\nURu$_{2}$Si$_{2}$ of $ac$- and $ab$-plane surfaces. Our data demonstrate the\nitinerant character of the narrow 5f bands, becoming progressively coherent as\ntemperature is lowered below a cross-over temperature $T^*{\\sim}75~K$. $T^*$ is\nhigher than in previous reports as a result of a different sample preparation,\nwhich minimizes residual strain. We furthermore present the density-response\n(energy-loss) function of this compound, and determine the energies of the\nheavy fermion plasmons with $a$-and $c$-axis polarization. Our observation of a\nsuppression of optical conductivity below 50~meV both along $a$ and $c$-axis,\nalong with a heavy fermion plasmon at 18~meV, points toward the emergence of a\nband of coherent charge carriers crossing the Fermi energy and the emergence of\na hybridization gap on part of the Fermi surface. The evolution towards\ncoherent itinerant states is accelerated below the hidden order temperature\n$T_{HO}=17.5$~K. In the hidden order phase the low frequency optical\nconductivity shows a single gap at $\\sim 6.5$meV, which closes at $T_{HO}$.\n", "  In the early Universe, strongly interacting matter was a quark-gluon plasma.\nBoth lattice computations and heavy ion collision experiments however tell us\nthat, in the absence of chemical potentials, no plasma survives at $T <\\sim\n150$ MeV. The cosmological Quark-Hadron transition, however, seems to have been\na crossover; cosmological consequences envisaged when it was believed to be a\nphase transition no longer hold. In this paper we discuss whether even a\ncrossover transition can leave an imprint that cosmological observations can\nseek or, viceversa, there are questions cosmology should address to QCD\nspecialists. In particular, we argue that it is still unclear how baryons (not\nhadrons) could form at the cosmological transition. A critical role should be\nplayed by diquark states, whose abundance in the early plasma needs to be\naccurately evaluated. We estimate that, if the number of quarks belonging to a\ndiquark state, at the beginning of the cosmological transition, is $<\\sim\n1:10^6$, its dynamics could be modified by the process of B-transfer from\nplasma to hadrons. In turn, by assuming B-transfer to cause just mild\nperturbations and, in particular, no entropy input, we study the deviations\nfrom the tracking regime, in the frame of SCDEW models. We find that, in some\ncases, residual deviations could propagate down to primeval nuclesynthesis.\n", "  Semiconductor lasers exhibit a wealth of dynamics, from emission of a\nconstant beam of light, to periodic oscillations and excitability. Self-pulsing\nregimes, where the laser periodically releases a short pulse of light, are\nparticularly interesting for many applications, from material science to\ntelecommunications. Self-pulsing regimes need to produce pulses very regularly\nand, as such, they are also known to be particularly sensitive to\nperturbations, such as noise or light injection.\n  We investigate the effect of delayed optical feedback on the dynamics of a\nself-pulsing semiconductor laser with saturable absorber (SLSA). More\nprecisely, we consider the Yamada model with delay -- a system of three\ndelay-differential equations (DDEs) for two slow and one fast variable -- which\nhas been shown to reproduce accurately self-pulsing features as observed in\nSLSA experimentally. This model is also of broader interest because it is quite\nclosely related to mathematical models of other self-pulsing systems, such as\nexcitable spiking neurons.\n  We perform a numerical bifurcation analysis of the Yamada model with delay,\nwhere we consider both the feedback delay, the feedback strength and the\nstrength of pumping as bifurcation parameters. We find a rapidly increasing\ncomplexity of the system dynamics when the feedback delay is increased from\nzero. In particular, there are new feedback-induced dynamics: stable\nquasi-periodic oscillations on tori, as well as a large degree of\nmultistability, with up to five pulse-like stable periodic solutions with\ndifferent amplitudes and repetition rates. An attractor map in the plane of\nperturbations on the gain and intensity reveals a Cantor set-like, intermingled\nstructure of the different basins of attraction. This suggests that, in\npractice, the multistable laser is extremely sensitive to small perturbations.\n", "  We advanced a previously reported model for the \\textit{in situ} scattering\ndata analysis of coexisting lipid domains in free-floating multilamellar\nvesicles. Based on the scattering density profile of the individual domains we\nconsidered in particular modifications due to positionally anticorrelated\ndomains or the presence of cholesterol. The latter aspect can be easily\nextended to any other lipophilic molecule. This allowed us to retrieve elastic\nand structural details (bending fluctuations, domain thickness, area per lipid)\nof coexisting liquid-ordered/liquid-disordered domains, including the\npartitioning of cholesterol from small-angle x-ray scattering experiments.\nMoreover, the model also successfully fitted data of multilamellar vesicles\nexhibiting nanoscopic domains, which displayed unlike coexisting micron-sized\ndomains no clear signal for two lamellar lattices. Our results indicate a\npreviously not observed translation of cholesterol toward the bilayer center of\nnanoscopic liquid-ordered domains.\n", "  This paper is concerned with backward problem for nonlinear space fractional\ndiffusion with additive noise on the right-hand side and the final value. To\nregularize the instable solution, we develop some new regularized method for\nsolving the problem. In the case of constant coefficients, we use the\ntruncation methods. In the case of perturbed time dependent coefficients, we\napply a new quasi-reversibility method. We also show the convergence rate\nbetween the regularized solution and the sought solution under some a priori\nassumption on the sought solution.\n", "  A double-layer Kerr resonator in which both coupled modes are excited and\ninteract with each other via incoherent cross-phase modulation is investigated\nto reveal stable localized solutions beyond the usual formation mechanism\ninvolving a single mode. Periodic solutions from modulational instability are\nfound to occur at a slight penalty on the nonlinear efficiency, but they\nstabilize the spatial dynamics, leading to dissipative solitons in previously\nunattainable regimes. Numerical simulations show paired breather solitons in\naddition to temporally stable solutions. The results demonstrate coupled modes\ncan increase the stability of Kerr frequency comb generation.\n", "  We consider the Frobenius algebra of functions on the critical set of the\nmaster function of a weighted arrangement of hyperplanes in $\\C^k$ with normal\ncrossings. We construct two potential functions (of first and second kind) of\nvariables labeled by hyperplanes of the arrangement and prove that the matrix\ncoefficients of the Grothendieck residue bilinear form on the algebra are given\nby the $2k$-th derivatives of the potential function of first kind and the\nmatrix coefficients of the multiplication operators on the algebra are given by\nthe $(2k+1)$-st derivatives of the potential function of second kind. Thus the\ntwo potentials completely determine the Frobenius algebra. The presence of\nthese potentials is a manifestation of a Frobenius like structure similar to\nthe Frobenius manifold structure.\n  We introduce the notion of an elementary subarrangement of an arrangement\nwith normal crossings. It turns out that our potential functions are local in\nthe sense that the potential functions are sums of contributions from\nelementary subarrangements of the given arrangement. This is a new phenomenon\nof locality of the Grothendieck residue bilinear form and multiplication on the\nalgebra.\n  It is known that this Frobenius algebra of functions on the critical set is\nisomorphic to the Bethe algebra of this arrangement. (That Bethe algebra is an\nanalog of the Bethe algebras in the theory of quantum integrable models.) Thus\nour potential functions describe that Bethe algebra too.\n", "  The operation of quantum dots at highest possible temperatures is desirable\nfor many applications. Capacitance-voltage spectroscopy (C(V)-spectroscopy)\nmeasurements are an established instrument to analyze the electronic structure\nand energy levels of self-assembled quantum dots (QDs). We perform C(V) in the\ndark and C(V) under the influence of non-resonant illumination, probing exciton\nstates up to $X^{4+}$ on InAs QDs embedded in a GaAs matrix for temperatures\nranging from 2.5 K to 120 K. While a small shift in the charging spectra\nresonance is observed for the two pure spin degenerate electron s-state\ncharging voltages with increasing temperature, a huge shift is visible for the\nelectron-hole excitonic states resonance voltages. The $s_2$-peak moves to\nslightly higher, the $s_1$-peak to slightly lower charging voltages. In\ncontrast, the excitonic states are surprisingly charged at much lower voltages\nupon increasing temperature. We derive a rate-model allowing to attribute and\nvalue different contributions to these shifts. Resonant tunnelling, state\ndegeneracy and hole generation rate in combination with the Fermi distribution\nfunction turn out to be of great importance for the observed effects. The\ndifferences in the shifting behavior is connected to different equilibria\nschemes for the peaks; s-peaks arise when tunneling-in- and out-rates become\nequal, while excitonic peaks occur, when electron tunneling-in- and\nhole-generation rates are balanced.\n", "  A generalized equation of state corresponding to a model that includes a\nChaplygin gas and a viscous term is investigated, in the context of the\nreconstruction program in scalar field cosmology. The corresponding\ninflationary model parameters can be conveniently adjusted in order to\nreproduce the most recent PLANCK data. The influence of the Chaplygin gas term\ncontribution, in relation with previous models, is discussed. Exit from\ninflation is shown to occur quite naturally in the new model.\n", "  We present a detailed study of the Vaidya solution and its generalization in\nde Rham-Gabadadze-Tolley (dRGT) theory. Since the diffeomorphism invariance can\nbe restored with the St\\\"{u}ckelberg fields $\\phi^a$ introduced, there is a new\ninvariant $I^{ab}=g^{\\mu \\nu}\\partial_\\mu \\phi^a\\partial_\\nu \\phi^b$ in the\nmassive gravity, which adds to the ones usually encountered in general\nrelativity. There is no conventional Vaidya solution if we choose unitary\ngauge. In this paper, we obtain three types of self-consistent ansatz with some\nnonunitary gauge, and find accordingly the Vaidya, generalized Vaidya and furry\nVaidya solution. As by-products, we obtain a series of furry black hole. The\nVaidya solution and its generalization in dRGT massive gravity describe the\nblack holes with a variable horizon.\n", "  We give a physical realization of the Bala-Carter labels that classify\nnilpotent orbits of semi-simple Lie algebras, for the case\n$\\mathfrak{g}=A,D,E$. We start from type IIB string theory compactified on an\n$ADE$ singularity and study the six-dimensional (2,0) $\\mathfrak{g}$-type\nlittle string on a Riemann surface with punctures. The defects are introduced\nas D-branes wrapping the 2-cycles of the singularity. At low energies, the\nlittle string becomes the (2,0) conformal field theory of type $\\mathfrak{g}$.\nAs an application, we derive the full list of $E_n$ little string defects, and\ntheir Bala-Carter label in the CFT limit. Furthermore, we investigate new\nrelations between the quiver gauge theory describing the D-brane defects at low\nenergies, and the weighted Dynkin diagrams of $\\mathfrak{g}$. We also give a\nphysical version of the dimension formula of a nilpotent orbit based on its\nweighted Dynkin diagram.\n", "  The close approach of the Fermi energy EF of a Dirac semimetal to the Dirac\npoint ED uncovers new physics such as velocity renormalization,1,2,3 and the\nDirac plasma 4,5 at |EF -ED| < kBT, where kBT is the thermal energy. In\ngraphene, substrate disorder drives fluctuations in EF. Three-dimensional\ntopological Dirac semimetals (TDS)6,7 obviate the substrate, and should show\nreduced EF fluctuations due to better metallic screening and higher dielectric\nconstants. Here we map the potential fluctuations in TDS Na3Bi using a scanning\ntunneling microscope. The rms potential fluctuations are significantly smaller\nthan room temperature ({\\Delta}EF,rms = 4-6 meV = 40-70 K) and comparable to\nthe highest quality graphene on h-BN;8 far smaller than graphene on SiO2,9,10\nor the Dirac surface state of a topological insulator.11 Surface Na vacancies\nproduce a novel resonance close to the Dirac point with surprisingly large\nspatial extent and provides a unique way to tune the surface density of states\nin a TDS thin-film material.\n", "  SDSS J072910.34+333634.3 is a reddened quasar at z=0.96. The archivel\nKeck/ESI spectrum and our new P200/TripleSpec spectrum reveal an absorption\nline system in He I*, Ca II H\\&K and Na ID. The absorption line system has a\nwidth of $\\sim$600 km/s and a blueshift velocity of $\\sim$800 km/s relative to\nthe core of narrow emission lines, indicating an outflow. Using the Ca II\ndoublet, we determined that the outflowing gas covers $\\sim$70\\% of the\ncontinuum. On the other hand, the HST/ACS image which taken in rest-frame 4130\n\\AA\\ show that the fraction of the quasar emission in ESI aperture was $<$40\\%.\nWe thus conclude that the absorbing gas covers a significant fraction of\nextended starlight emission, and the best-estimated fraction of $\\sim$50\\%\nyields a lower limit of the crosssectional area of the outflowing gas to be\n$>$8 kpc$^2$. The strong Na\\&Ca absorption suggests that the absorbing gas is\nthick and mostly neutral, which is also supported by dust extinction\n$A_V\\sim3$. Using the best-estimated hydrogen column density\n$N_H\\sim3\\times10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$, the total mass of the outflowing gas is\n$>3\\times10^9 M_\\odot$. The outflow is likely to be driven by AGN because of\nthe $\\sim$800 km/s blueshift velocity, suggesting SDSS J072910.34+333634.3 is\nundergoing one of the most violent AGN feedback we have seen. In the future,\none can find more such massive neutral gas outflows in other reddened quasars\nusing similar method, and this can shed new light on the study of AGN feedback.\n", "  The importance of peer influence on consumer actions plays a vital role in\nmarketing efforts. However, peer influence effects are often confounded with\nlatent homophily, which are unobserved commonalities that drive friendship.\nUnderstanding causality has become one of the pressing issues of current\nresearch. We present an approach to explicitly account for various causal\ninfluences. We implement a simulation framework to show the effectiveness of\ntwo latent homophily proxies, latent coordinates and community membership, in\nimproving peer influence effect estimates on game downloads in a Japanese\nsocial network website. We demonstrate that latent homophily proxies have no\nsignificant improvement in peer influence effect bias in the available website\ndata.\n", "  Mounting evidence for the role of oxidative stress in the degeneration of\narticular cartilage after an injurious impact requires our modeling &\nsimulation efforts to temporarily shift from just describing the effect of\nmechanical stress and inflammation on osteoarthritis (OA). The hypothesis that\nthe injurious impact causes irreversible damage to chondrocyte mitochondria,\nwhich in turn increase their production of free radicals, affecting their\nenergy production and their ability to rebuild the extracellular matrix, has to\nbe modeled and the processes quantified in order to further the understanding\nof OA, its causes, and viable treatment options. The current article presents a\ncalibrated model that captures the damage oxidative stress incurs on the cell\nviability, ATP production, and cartilage stability in a cartilage explant after\na drop-tower impact. The model validates the biological hypothesis and will be\nused in further efforts to identify possibilities for treatment and be a part\nof a bigger modeling & simulation framework for the development of OA.\n", "  A new, automated method of detecting coronal mass ejections (CMEs) in three\ndimensions for the LASCO C2 and STEREO COR2 coronagraphs is presented. By\ntriangulating isolated CME signal from the three coronagraphs over a sliding\nwindow of five hours, the most likely region through which CMEs pass at 5 solar\nradii is identified. The centre and size of the region gives the most likely\ndirection of propagation and approximate angular extent. The Automated CME\nTriangulation (ACT) method is tested extensively using a series of synthetic\nCME images created using a wireframe flux rope density model, and on a sample\nof real coronagraph data; including halo CMEs. The accuracy of the angular\ndifference between the detection and true input of the synthetic CMEs is 7.14\ndegrees, and remains acceptable for a broad range of CME positions relative to\nthe observer, the relative separation of the three observers and even through\nthe loss of one coronagraph. For real data, the method gives results that\ncompare well with the distribution of low coronal sources and results from\nanother instrument and technique made further from the Sun. The true three\ndimension (3D)-corrected kinematics and mass/density are discussed. The results\nof the new method will be incorporated into the CORIMP database in the near\nfuture, enabling improved space weather diagnostics and forecasting.\n", "  Two-particle angular correlation measurements are sensitive probes of the\ninteractions of particles with the medium formed in heavy-ion collisions. Such\nmeasurements are done by determining the distribution of the relative\npseudorapidity ($\\Delta\\eta$) and azimuthal angle ($\\Delta\\varphi$) of\nparticles with respect to a higher $p_T$ trigger particle ($1 < p_{T,trig} < 8$\nGeV/c). The near-side peak is fitted with a function, which includes both the\nnear-side jet peak and also accounts for the $\\Delta\\eta$-independent\nlong-range correlations. The centrality evolution of the width (variance) of\nthe fitted distribution is investigated. In Pb-Pb collisions a significant\nbroadening of the near-side peak in the $\\Delta\\eta$ direction is observed from\nperipheral to central collisions, while in the $\\Delta\\varphi$ direction the\npeak is almost independent of centrality. For the 10% most central events, a\ndeparture from the Gaussian shape is also observed at low transverse momentum\n($1 < p_{T,assoc} < 2$ GeV/c, $1 < p_{T,trig} < 3$ GeV/c). In this contribution\nthe results obtained by the ALICE experiment in Pb-Pb and pp collisions at\n$\\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 2.76$ TeV are shown, and they are interpreted in terms of\nradial and elliptic flow by comparing them to AMPT model simulations.\n", "  Exposing the polarization signatures of the solar chromosphere requires\nstudying its temporal variations, which is rarely done when modelling and\ninterpreting scattering and Hanle signals. The present contribution sketches\nthe scientific problem of solar polarization diagnosis from the point of view\nof the temporal dimension, remarking some key aspects for solving it. Our\ntime-dependent calculations expose the need of considering dynamics explicitly\nwhen modelling and observing scattering polarization in order to achieve\neffective diagnosis techniques as well as a deeper knowledge of the second\nsolar spectrum.\n", "  The thermal-photon emission from strongly coupled gauge theories at finite\ntemperature via the bottom-up models in holographic QCD in the deconfined phase\nis studied. The models are constructed to approximately reproduce the electric\nconductivity obtained from lattice simulations for the quark gluon plasma\n(QGP). The emission rates are then embedded in hydrodynamic simulations\ncombined with prompt photons and hadronic contributions to analyze the spectra\nand anisotropic flow of direct photons in RHIC and LHC. In general, the\nholographic models enhance the yield and improve the agreement in spectra,\nwhile they reduce the flow in low $p_T$ and increase it in high $p_T$.\n", "  The Gaia-ESO Survey (GES) is obtaining high quality spectra of $\\sim$10$^{5}$\nstars in our Galaxy, providing an homogeneous and unique overview of all the\nmain components of the Milky Way, its formation history and the evolution of\nyoung, mature and ancient Galactic populations. Our group is in charge of the\nearly-type massive stars that define the youngest population in the survey. In\nthis contribution, we present the results of the quantitative spectroscopic\nanalysis of O-type stars in the Carina Nebula within the Gaia-ESO Survey. For\nthis aim, we have used FASTWIND and CMFGEN stellar atmosphere codes, providing\nstellar parameters for the current sample (GES data release iDR4).\n", "  High critical density molecular lines like HCN(1-0) or HCO+(1-0) represent\nour best tool to study currently star-forming, dense molecular gas at\nextragalactic distances. The optical depth of these lines is a key ingredient\nto estimate the effective density required to excite emission. However,\nconstraints on this quantity are even scarcer in the literature than\nmeasurements of the high density tracers themselves. Here, we combine new\nobservations of HCN, HCO+ and HNC(1-0) and their optically thin isotopologues\nH13CN, H13CO+ and HN13C(1-0) to measure isotopologue line ratios. We use IRAM\n30-m observations from the large program EMPIRE and new ALMA observations,\nwhich together target 6 nearby star-forming galaxies. Using spectral stacking\ntechniques, we calculate or place strong upper limits on the HCN/H13CN,\nHCO+/H13CO+ and HNC/HN13C line ratios in the inner parts of these galaxies.\nUnder simple assumptions, we use these to estimate the optical depths of\nHCN(1-0) and HCO+(1-0) to be \\tau ~2-11 in the active, inner regions of our\ntargets. The critical densities are consequently lowered to values between\n5-20$\\times 10^5$, 1-3$\\times 10^5$ and 9$\\times 10^4$ cm-3 for HCN, HCO+ and\nHNC, respectively. We study the impact of having different beam-filling\nfactors, $\\eta$, on these estimates and find that the effective critical\ndensities decrease by a factor of $\\frac{\\eta_{12}}{\\eta_{13}}\\,\\tau_{12}$. A\ncomparison to existing work in NGC 5194 and NGC 253 shows HCN/H13CN and\nHCO+/H13CO+ ratios in agreement with our measurements within the uncertainties.\nThe same is true for studies in other environments such as the Galactic Centre\nor nuclear regions of AGN-dominated nearby galaxies.\n", "  The observed pseudo-periodic reversal of the upper layer circulation of the\nIonian Sea has been assumed to be related to some internal feedback processes\n(density driven) by the so called BiOS (Adriatic-Ionian Bimodal Oscillating\nSystem) hypothesis. The mechanism seems to be very well described by a\nnon-linear oscillator dynamical system. By setting the state variables as the\nsalinity of Adriatic deep water and the sea level anomaly in the Ionian region\na Van der Pol equation has been obtained. The periodic cycle so obtained is of\nthe order of a decade as observed in the data. Furthermore, a periodic term,\nwhich mimics the decadal variability of the forcing (mainly atmospheric),\nproduces a period doubling phenomenon which is typical of the forced Van der\nPol oscillator. By considering also a stochastic gaussian noise acting as a\nforcing and a decadal periodic input term, having an amplitude much smaller\nthan the noise variance, a sub-harmonic stochastic resonance appears in the\nsolution for a certain range of the values of the parameters. This yields the\npossibility of a longer time scale variability of the BiOS mechanism.\n", "  Preliminary results on a canonical formulation of general relativity based on\nan analogy with the string model of elementary particles are presented. Rather\nthan the metric components, the basic fields of the formalism are taken to be\nthe functions describing the embedding of four dimensional spacetime in a ten\nor possibly higher dimensional manifold. So far, the main drawback of the\nformalism is that the generator of normal deformations (\"fourth constraint\")\ncannot be written down in closed form. The present approach is compared and\ncontrasted with the usual one and with the canonical description of the\nrelativistic string.\n", "  Planetary systems commonly survive the evolution of single stars, as\nevidenced by terrestrial-like planetesimal debris observed orbiting and\npolluting the surfaces of white dwarfs. This letter reports the identification\nof a circumbinary dust disk surrounding a white dwarf with a substellar\ncompanion in a 2.27 hr orbit. The system bears the dual hallmarks of\natmospheric metal pollution and infrared excess, however the standard (flat and\nopaque) disk configuration is dynamically precluded by the binary. Instead, the\ndetected reservoir of debris must lie well beyond the Roche limit in an\noptically thin configuration, where erosion by stellar irradiation is\nrelatively rapid. This finding demonstrates that rocky planetesimal formation\nis robust around close binaries, even those with low mass ratios.\n", "  While photons travel in a straight line at constant velocity in free-space,\nthe intensity profile of structured light may be tailored for acceleration in\nany degree of freedom. Here we propose a simple approach to control the angular\nacceleration of light. Using Laguerre-Gaussian modes as our twisted beams\ncarrying orbital angular momentum, we show that superpositions of opposite\nhandedness result in a radially dependent angular acceleration as they pass\nthrough a focus (waist plane). Due to conservation of orbital angular momentum\nwe find that propagation dynamics are complex despite the free-space medium:\nthe outer part of the beam (rings) rotates in an opposite direction to the\ninner part (petals), and while the outer part accelerates so the inner part\ndecelerates. We outline the concepts theoretically and confirm them\nexperimentally. Such exotic structured light beams are topical due to their\nmany applications, e.g., optical trapping and tweezing, metrology and\nfundamental studies in optics.\n", "  Carrier dynamics acquire a new character in the presence of Bloch-band Berry\ncurvature, which naturally arises in gapped Dirac materials (GDMs). Here we\nargue that photoresponse in GDMs with small band gaps is dramatically enhanced\nby Berry curvature. This manifests in a giant and saturable Hall\nphotoconductivity when illuminated by circularly polarized light. Unlike Hall\nmotion arising from a Lorentz force in a magnetic field, which impedes\nlongitudinal carrier motion, Hall photoconductivity arising from Berry\ncurvature can boost longitudinal carrier transport. In GDMs, this results in a\nhelicity-dependent photoresponse in the Hall regime, where photoconductivity is\ndominated by its Hall component. We find that the induced Hall conductivity per\nincident irradiance is enhanced by up to six orders of magnitude when moving\nfrom the visible regime (with corresponding band gaps) to the far infrared.\nThese results suggest that narrow-gap GDMs are an ideal test-bed for the unique\nphysics that arise in the presence of Berry curvature, and open a new avenue\nfor infrared and terahertz optoelectronics.\n", "  The outskirts of galaxies offer extreme environments where we can test our\nunderstanding of the formation, evolution, and destruction of molecules and\ntheir relationship with star formation and galaxy evolution. We review the\nbasic equations that are used in normal environments to estimate physical\nparameters like the molecular gas mass from CO line emission and dust continuum\nemission. Then we discuss how those estimates may be affected when applied to\nthe outskirts, where the average gas density, metallicity, stellar radiation\nfield, and temperature may be lower. We focus on observations of molecular gas\nin the outskirts of the Milky Way, extragalactic disk galaxies, early-type\ngalaxies, groups, and clusters. The scientific results show the versatility of\nmolecular gas, as it has been used to trace Milky Way spiral arms out to a\ngalactocentric radius of 15 kpc, to study star formation in extended\nultraviolet disk galaxies, to probe galaxy interactions in polar ring S0\ngalaxies, and to investigate ram pressure stripping in clusters. We highlight\nthe physical stimuli that accelerate the formation of molecular gas, including\ninternal processes such as spiral arm compression and external processes such\nas interactions.\n", "  ESPRESSO is a high-resolution-ultra-stable spectrograph for the VLT, whose\ncommissioning will start in 2017. One of its key science goals is to test the\nstability of nature's fundamental couplings with unprecedented accuracy and\ncontrol of possible systematics. A total of 27 nights of the ESPRESSO\nConsortium's guaranteed time observations (GTO) will be spent in testing the\nstability of the fine-structure constant and other fundamental couplings. A set\nof 14 priority optimal targets have been selected for the GTO period. Here we\nbriefly discuss the criteria underlying this selection and describe the\nselected targets, and then present detailed forecasts of the impact of these\nmeasurements on fundamental physics and cosmology, focusing on dark energy\nconstraints and using future supernova type Ia surveys as a comparison point.\nWe show how canonical reconstructions of the dark energy equation of state are\nimproved by the extended redshift range enabled by these spectroscopic\nmeasurements, and also quantify additional improvements foreseen for a future\nELT-HIRES instrument.\n", "  In 1986, a cuprate superconductor (Ba-La-Cu-O system) having a critical\ntemperature which goes over the BCS limit (~30 K) was discovered and then a\ncuprate superconductor (Y-Ba-Cu-O system) with a critical temperature higher\nthan 77 K was discovered. Furthermore, a Hg-based cuprate with a critical\ntemperature of 133 K was found. The 133 K is still the highest critical\ntemperature of conventional superconductors under atmospheric pressure.\n  We have shown that materials obtained by bringing n-alkanes into contact with\ngraphite are capable of conducting electricity with almost no energy loss at\nroom temperature. We here report that the sudden jump in resistance showing a\nphase transition is observed in the materials during heating by two-probe\nresistance measurement. The measured critical temperatures of the materials\nconsisting of pitch-based graphite fibers and n-alkanes having 7-16 carbon\natoms range from 363.08 to 504.24 K and the transition widths range between\n0.15 and 3.01 K. We also demonstrate that superconductors with critical\ntemperatures beyond 504 K are obtained by alkanes with 16 or more carbon atoms.\n", "  The Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) is an integral-field\nspectrograph operating in the visible wavelength range, and installed at the\nVery Large Telescope (VLT). The official MUSE pipeline is available from ESO.\nHowever, for the data reduction of the Deep Fields program (Bacon et al., in\nprep.), we have built a more sophisticated reduction pipeline, with additional\nreduction tasks, to extend the official pipeline and produce cubes with fewer\ninstrumental residuals.\n", "  Solitude verification is arguably one of the simplest fundamental problems in\ndistributed computing, where the goal is to verify that there is a unique\ncontender in a network. This paper devises a quantum algorithm that exactly\nsolves the problem on an anonymous network, which is known as a network model\nwith minimal assumptions [Angluin, STOC'80]. The algorithm runs in $O(N)$\nrounds if every party initially has the common knowledge of an upper bound $N$\non the number of parties. This implies that all solvable problems can be solved\nin $O(N)$ rounds on average without error (i.e., with zero-sided error) on the\nnetwork. As a generalization, a quantum algorithm that works in $O(N\\log_2\n(\\max\\{k,2\\}))$ rounds is obtained for the problem of exactly computing any\nsymmetric Boolean function, over $n$ distributed input bits, which is constant\nover all the $n$ bits whose sum is larger than $k$ for $k\\in \\{0,1,\\dots,\nN-1\\}$. All these algorithms work with the bit complexities bounded by a\npolynomial in $N$.\n", "  The thermal conductivities of MoS2 and WS2 have been reported by some\nexperimental and theoretical studies, however, the results are different from\neach other. Here, thermal transport properties of twelve types of single layer\ntransition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) MX2 (M = Cr, Mo, W; X = O, S, Se, Te)\nare investigated systematically, by solving Boltzmann transport equation based\non first-principle calculations. After accurate considering the size effect and\nboundary scattering, we find that our calculations can fit the former\nexperimental results well. Moreover, diverse transport properties in TMDs are\nrevealed, and an abnormal dependence of thermal conductivity on atomic mass is\nobserved. In most MX2 structures, the thermal conductivities decrease with the\nincrease of mass of atom M or X. However, the thermal conductivities of\nsulfides MS2 and selenides MSe2 increase as M changes from Cr to Mo to W, which\nis contradictory to our traditional understanding. A detailed calculation\nindicates that the abnormal trend is originated from the rapid increase of\nphonon relaxation time. Our studies provide important data and effective\nmechanism for thermal transport in TMDs.\n", "  The search for thermoelectrics with higher figures of merit (ZT) will never\nstop due to the demand of heat harvesting. Single layer transition metal\ndichalcogenides (TMD), namely MX2 (where M is a transition metal and X is a\nchalcogen) that have electronic band gaps are among the new materials that have\nbeen the focus of such research. Here, we investigate the thermoelectric\ntransport properties of hybrid armchair-edged TMDs nanoribbons, by using the\nnonequilibrium Green's function technique combined with the first principles\nand molecular dynamics methods. We find a ZT as high as 7.4 in hybrid\nMoS2/MoSe2 nanoribbons at 800K, creating a new record for ZT. Moreover, the\nhybrid interfaces by substituting X atoms are more efficient than those by\nsubstituting M atoms to tune the ZT. The origin of such a high ZT of hybrid\nnanoribbons is the high density of the grain boundaries: the hybrid interfaces\ndecrease thermal conductance drastically without a large penalty to electronic\nconductance.\n", "  While dragonflies are highly agile flyers, some key aerodynamic mechanisms\nresponsible for their flight performance remain inadequately understood. Based\non forward flight conditions, we investigate dragonfliess spanwise aerodynamic\nbehaviors associated with flapping wings phasing relationship. Overall, the\nleading edge vortex (LEV) on the forewing forms without the influence of the\nhindwing. For hindwing, the wing root region prominently displays a trailing\nedge vortex (TEV). In the inner span region, the vortical flow structures\naround the hindwing is influenced by the forewings LEV when both wings are in\nclose proximity and move in opposite directions. In the mid-span region,\ndownwash following the forewing suppresses LEV formation on the hindwing.\nFinally the outer span region of the hindwing develops its LEV by wake capture\nat the end of a stroke cycle. In the inner region, the timing of shedding on\nboth fore- and hind-wings is synchronized, which is not the case elsewhere.\nThese varied flow structures suggest that the fore- and hind-wings, along their\nspanwise directions, play different roles in force generation.\n", "  The valley degree of freedom in two-dimensional (2D) crystals recently\nemerged as a novel information carrier in addition to spin and charge. The\nintrinsic valley lifetime in 2D transition metal dichalcoginides (TMD) is\nexpected to be remarkably long due to the unique spin-valley locking behavior,\nwhere the inter-valley scattering of electron requires simultaneously a large\nmomentum transfer to the opposite valley and a flip of the electron spin. The\nexperimentally observed valley lifetime in 2D TMDs, however, has been limited\nto tens of nanoseconds so far. Here we report efficient generation of\nmicrosecond-long lived valley polarization in WSe2/MoS2 heterostructures by\nexploiting the ultrafast charge transfer processes in the heterostructure that\nefficiently creates resident holes in the WSe2 layer. These valley-polarized\nholes exhibit near unity valley polarization and ultralong valley lifetime: we\nobserve a valley-polarized hole population lifetime of over 1 us, and a valley\ndepolarization lifetime (i.e. inter-valley scattering lifetime) over 40 us at\n10 Kelvin. The near-perfect generation of valley-polarized holes in TMD\nheterostructures with ultralong valley lifetime, orders of magnitude longer\nthan previous results, opens up new opportunities for novel valleytronics and\nspintronics applications.\n", "  We present an update of the finite temperature phase structure analysis for\nthree flavor QCD. In the study the Iwasaki gauge action and non-perturvatively\nO($a$) improved Wilson-Clover fermion action are employed. We discuss finite\nsize scaling analysis including mixings of magnetization-like and energy-like\nobservables. Preliminary results are shown of the continuum limit of the\ncritical point using newly generated data at Nt=8,10, including estimates of\nthe critical pseudo-scalar meson mass and critical temperature.\n", "  We investigate the generation of ultraviolet (UV) second-harmonic radiation\non the boundary of a UV transparent crystal, which is derived from the\nautomatic partial phase matching of the incident wave and the total internal\nreflection. By adhering to another UV non-transparency crystal with larger\nsecond-order nonlinear coefficient \\chi^{(2)}, an nonlinear interface with\nlarge disparity in \\chi^{(2)} is formed and the enhancement of UV\nsecond-harmonic radiation is observed experimentally. The intensity of enhanced\nsecond harmonic wave generated at the nonlinear interface was up to 11.6 times\nat the crystal boundary. As a tunable phase-matching method, it may suggest\npotential applications in the UV, even vacuum-UV, spectral region.\n", "  We report a development of probabilistic framework for parameter inference of\ncryogenic two-phase flow based on fast two-fluid solver. We introduce a concise\nset of cryogenic correlations and discuss its parameterization. We present\nresults of application of proposed approach to the analysis of cryogenic\nchilldoown in horizontal transfer line. We demonstrate simultaneous\noptimization of large number of model parameters obtained using global\noptimization algorithms. It is shown that the proposed approach allows accurate\npredictions of experimental data obtained both with saturated and sub-cooled\nliquid nitrogen flow. We discuss extension of predictive capabilities of the\nmodel to practical full scale systems.\n", "  In this paper, we present a simple analytical method for obtaining a\nnonspreading solution of the time-dependent Schr\\\"odinger equation, which is\ngiven by the Airy function. The solution is derived by imposing a restriction\non the phase factor of the ansatz that is taken to solve the differential\nequation. Considering at first the free particle, we show that nonspreading\nsolutions can also be obtained for a time-dependent linear potential. The\nmethod is shown to work in both one and two dimensions, and can be easily\nextended if required. The applicability of the method is discussed in relation\nto the nonlinear case.\n", "  Pi-conjugated segments - chromophores - constitute the electronically active\nunits of polymer materials used in organic electronics. To elucidate the effect\nof bending of these linear moieties on elementary electronic properties such as\nluminescence colour and radiative rate we introduce a series of molecular\npolygons. The pi-system in these molecules becomes so distorted in\nbichromophores (digons) that these absorb and emit light of arbitrary\npolarisation: any part of the chain absorbs and emits radiation with equal\nprobability. Bending leads to a cancellation of transition dipole moment (TDM),\nincreasing excited-state lifetime. Simultaneously, fluorescence shifts to the\nred as radiative transitions require mixing of the excited state with\nvibrational modes. However, strain can become so large that excited-state\nlocalisation on shorter units of the chain occurs, compensating TDM\ncancellation. Since these effects counteract, underlying correlations between\nshape and photophysics can only be resolved in single molecules.\n", "  In a joint theoretical and experimental work the optical properties of\nazobenzene-functionalized self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) are studied at\ndifferent molecular packing densities. Our results, based on density-functional\nand many-body perturbation theory, as well as on differential reflectance (DR)\nspectroscopy, shed light on the microscopic mechanisms ruling photo-absorption\nin these systems. While the optical excitations are intrinsically excitonic in\nnature, regardless of the molecular concentration, in densely-packed SAMs\nintermolecular coupling and local-field effects are responsible for a sizable\nweakening of the exciton binding strength. Through a detailed analysis of the\ncharacter of the electron-hole pairs, we show that distinct excitations\ninvolved in the photo-isomerization at low molecular concentrations are\ndramatically broadened by intermolecular interactions. Spectral shifts in the\ncalculated DR spectra are in good agreement with the experimental results. Our\nfindings represent an important step forward to rationalize the excited-state\nproperties of these complex materials.\n", "  Red giant stars present mixed modes, which behave as pressure modes in the\nconvective envelope and as gravity modes in the radiative interior. This mixed\ncharacter allows to probe the physical conditions in their core. With the\nadvent of long-duration time series from space-borne missions such as CoRoT and\nKepler, it becomes possible to study the red giant core rotation. As more than\n15 000 red giant light curves have been recorded, it is crucial to develop a\nrobust and efficient method to measure this rotation. Such measurements of\nthousands of mean core rotation would open the way to a deeper understanding of\nthe physical mechanisms that are able to transport angular momentum from the\ncore to the envelope in red giants. In this work, we detail the principle of\nthe method we developed to obtain automatic measurements of the red giant mean\ncore rotation. This method is based on the stretching of the oscillation\nspectra and on the use of the so-called Hough transform. We finally validate\nthis method for stars on the red giant branch, where overlapping rotational\nsplittings and mixed-mode spacings produce complicated frequency spectra.\n", "  The traditional fluid perturbation theory is improved by taking electronic\nexcitations and ionizations into account, in the framework of average ion\nspheres. It is applied to calculate the equation of state for fluid Xenon,\nwhich turns out in good agreement with the available shock data.\n", "  Inspired by a recent work of Tye and Wong, we examine an effect of a band\nstructure on baryon number preservation criteria requisite for successful\nelectroweak baryogenesis. Action of a reduced model is fully constructed\nincluding a time component of the gauge field that is missing in the original\nwork. The band structure is estimated more precisely in wider energy range\nbased on WKB framework with three connection formulas to find that the band\nstructure has little effect on the criteria at around 100 GeV temperature. We\nalso address an issue of suppression factors peculiar to the $(B+L)$-changing\nprocess in high-energy collisions at zero temperature.\n", "  Whether monochromatic, pulsed, or even constant and crossed, the field used\nto describe the interaction of charged fermions with an intense laser beam is\nmainly assumed to be of plane-wave form. We consider a simple extension to\nplane-wave fields and consider a scalar particle in a non-lightlike, univariate\nand transverse propagating electromagnetic wave. The existence of some known\nexact solutions in this case allows us to analyse various proposed\napproximations in the literature as well as the plane wave model. The results\nalso describe some of the quantum dynamics of a scalar particle in a standing\nwave background.\n", "  In this investigation, we examine how the precision of energy spectra and\nscattering phase shifts, extracted in lattice QCD, depend upon the degree of\ndistillation type smearing. We use the variational method to extract energy\nspectra for the isospin-1, $J^{PC}=1^{--}$ channel and use the L\\\"{u}scher\nmethod to compute scattering amplitudes, relevant for the $\\rho$ resonance, in\n$\\pi\\pi$ elastic scattering. Optimised interpolating operators for a single\nground state pion are constructed and these are used to construct two pion\noperators. Calculations are performed on an anisotropic lattice with a pion\nmass of $m_\\pi=236$ MeV. We provide a comprehensive comparison of energy\nspectra and scattering phase shifts across distillation spaces of varying rank.\n", "  The existence of multiple radial solutions to the elliptic equation modeling\nfermionic cloud of interacting particles is proved for the limiting Planck\nconstant and intermediate values of mass parameters. It is achieved by\nconsidering the related nonautonomous dynamical system for which the passage to\nthe limit can be established due to the continuity of the solutions with\nrespect to the parameter going to zero.\n", "  The modelling of massive star evolution is a complex task, and is very\nsensitive to the way physical processes (such as convection, rotation, mass\nloss, etc.) are included in stellar evolution code. Moreover, the very high\nobserved fraction of binary systems among massive stars makes the comparison\nwith observations difficult. In this paper, we focus on discussing the\nuncertainties linked to the modelling of convection and rotation in single\nmassive stars.\n", "  Combined action of weak and strong pinning centers on the vortex lattice\ncomplicates magnetic behavior of a superconductor since temperature and\nmagnetic field differently affect weak and strong pinning. In this paper we\nshow that contributions of weak and strong pinning into magnetization of the\nlayered superconductor YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\\delta}$ can be separated and\nanalyzed individually. We performed a careful analysis of temperature behavior\nof the relaxed superconducting current $J$ in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\\delta}$ films\nwhich revealed two components of the current $J = J_1 +J_2$. A simple method of\nseparation of the components and their temperature dependence in low magnetic\nfields are discussed. We found that $J_1$ is produced by weak collective\npinning on the oxygen vacancies in CuO$_2$ planes while $J_2$ is caused by\nstrong pinning on the Y$_2$O$_3$ precipitates. $J_1$ component weakly changes\nwith field and quasi-exponentially decays with temperature, disappearing at $T\n\\simeq 30$--40~K. Rapid relaxation of $J_1$ causes formation of the normalized\nrelaxation rate peak at $T \\simeq 20$~K. $J_2$ component is suppressed by field\nas $J_2\\propto B^{-0.54}$ and decays with temperature following to the power\nlaw $J_2\\propto(1 - T/T_\\mathrm{dp} )^\\alpha$ where $T_\\mathrm{dp}$ is the\ndepinning temperature. Detailed comparison of the experimental data with\npinning theories is presented.\n", "  We study the multiplicity and rapidity dependence of thermal and prompt\nphoton production in p+Pb collisions at 5.02 TeV, using a (3+1)D viscous\nhydrodynamic framework. Direct photon anisotropic flow coefficients\n$v^\\gamma_{2,3}$ and nuclear modification factor $R^\\gamma_\\mathrm{pPb}(p_T)$\nare presented in both the p-going (backward) and the Pb-going (forward)\ndirections. The interplay between initial state cold nuclear effect and final\nstate thermal enhancement at different rapidity regions is discussed. The\nproposed rapidity dependent thermal photon enhancement and direct photon\nanisotropic flow observables can elucidate non-trivial longitudinal dynamics of\nhot quark-gluon plasma droplets created in small collision systems.\n", "  We have conducted a search for optical circumstellar absorption lines in the\nspectra of 16 debris disc host stars. None of the stars in our sample showed\nsigns of emission line activity in either H$_{\\alpha}$, Ca II or Na I,\nconfirming their more evolved nature. Four stars were found to exhibit narrow\nabsorption features near the cores of the photospheric Ca II and Na I D lines\n(when Na I D data were available). We analyse the characteristics of these\nspectral features to determine whether they are of circumstellar or\ninterstellar origins. The strongest evidence for circumstellar gas is seen in\nthe spectrum of HD110058, which is known to host a debris disc observed close\nto edge-on. This is consistent with a recent ALMA detection of molecular gas in\nthis debris disc, which shows many similarities to the $\\beta$ Pictoris system.\n", "  Increasing imaging speed is of utmost importance in in-vivo magnetic\nresonance imaging (MRI). With simultaneous multi-slice (SMS) MRI we can\nsimultaneously acquire several slices of an object, which allows for higher\nundersampling factors compared to single- or conventional multi-slice\nmeasurements by exploiting axial coil sensitivity information. In this thesis,\nwe give a short introduction to the physical principles of MRI, cover the\nbasics of a FLASH based SMS MRI sequence and perform tests to verify its\naccuracy: We check the fidelity of the slice distance as well as the flip angle\nand confirm the square-root-like signal-to-noise ratio benefit of SMS compared\nto conventional multi-slice experiments. A g-factor analysis is used to\ndetermine a favorable Cartesian undersampling scheme for multi-slice data.\nCommon reconstruction strategies for SMS MRI make use of previously estimated\ncoil sensitivities to solve a linear equation. Here, we propose a new method of\nSMS MRI based on Regularized Nonlinear Inversion (NLINV): SMS-NLINV. This\nmethod does not require a priori knowledge about the coil sensitivities and is\nattractive especially for real-time imaging where coil sensitivities may change\ndue to motion or interactive changes to the slice position. We characterize the\nalgorithm and present reconstructed phantom and in-vivo images.\n", "  The fluid-solid-electric dynamics of a flexible plate covered by\ninterconnected piezoelectric patches in an axial steady flow are investigated\nusing numerical simulations based on a reduced-order model of the fluid loading\nfor slender structures. Beyond a critical flow velocity, the fluid-solid\ninstability results in large amplitude flapping of the structure. Short\npiezoelectric patches positioned continuously along the plate convert its local\ndeformation into electrical currents that are used within a single internal\nelectrical network acting as an electric generator for the external output\ncircuit. The relative role of the internal and external impedance on the energy\nharvesting of the system is presented and analyzed in the light of a full\nmodeling of the electric and mechanical energy exchanges and transport along\nthe structure.\n", "  We present STAR's measurement of the $e^{+}e^{-}$ continuum as a function of\ncentrality, invariant mass, and transverse momentum for U+U collisions at\n$\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 193 GeV. Also reported are the acceptance-corrected\n$e^{+}e^{-}$ invariant mass spectra for minimum-bias Au+Au collisions at\n$\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 27, 39, and 62.4 GeV and U+U collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ =\n193 GeV. The connection between the integrated $e^{+}e^{-}$ excess yields\nnormalized by charge particle multiplicity ($dN_{ch}/dy$) at mid-rapidity and\nthe lifetime of the fireball is discussed.\n", "  The associated production of a Higgs boson with a top quark-antiquark pair\n($\\text{t}\\bar{\\text{t}}\\text{H}$ production) or with a single top quark\n($\\text{tH}$ production) allows a direct measurement of the top-Higgs-Yukawa\ncoupling with minimal model dependence. In this article, recent results of\nsearches for $\\text{t}\\bar{\\text{t}}\\text{H}$ and $\\text{tH}$ production in the\n$\\text{H}\\rightarrow\\text{b}\\bar{\\text{b}}$ channel performed by the ATLAS and\nCMS experiments are reviewed. The analyses use pp collision data collected at a\ncentre-of-mass energy of 13$\\,$TeV corresponding to an integrated luminosity of\nup to 13.2$\\,$fb${}^{-1}$.\n", "  A deterministic sequence of real numbers in the unit interval is called\n\\emph{equidistributed} if its empirical distribution converges to the uniform\ndistribution. Furthermore, the limit distribution of the pair correlation\nstatistics of a sequence is called Poissonian if the number of pairs $x_k,x_l\n\\in (x_n)_{1 \\leq n \\leq N}$ which are within distance $s/N$ of each other is\nasymptotically $\\sim 2sN$. A randomly generated sequence has both of these\nproperties, almost surely. There seems to be a vague sense that having\nPoissonian pair correlations is a \"finer\" property than being equidistributed.\nIn this note we prove that this really is the case, in a precise mathematical\nsense: a sequence whose asymptotic distribution of pair correlations is\nPoissonian must necessarily be equidistributed. Furthermore, for sequences\nwhich are not equidistributed we prove that the square-integral of the\nasymptotic density of the sequence gives a lower bound for the asymptotic\ndistribution of the pair correlations.\n", "  Proton spin problem is given a new perspective with the proposition that spin\nis a topological invariant represented by a de Rham 3-period. The idea is\ndeveloped generalizing Finkelstein-Rubinstein theory for Skyrmions/kinks to\ntopological defects, and using nonabelian de Rham theorems. Two kinds of de\nRham theorems are discussed applicable to matrix valued differential forms, and\ntraces. Physical and mathematical interpretations of de Rham periods are\npresented. It is suggested that Wilson lines and loop operators probe the local\nproperties of the topology, and spin as a topological invariant in pDIS\nmeasurements could appear with any value from 0 to $\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$, i. e.\nproton spin decomposition has no meaning in this approach.\n", "  Photons radiated in heavy-ion collisions are a penetrating probe, and as such\ncan play an important role in the determination of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP)\ntransport coefficients. In this work we calculate the bulk viscous correction\nto photon production in two-to-two scattering reactions. Phase-space integrals\ndescribing the bulk viscous correction are evaluated explicitly in order to\navoid the forward scattering approximation which is shown to be poor for\nphotons at lower energies. We furthermore present hydrodynamical simulations of\nAA collisions focusing on the effect of this calculation on photonic\nobservables. Bulk corrections are shown to reduce the elliptic flow of photons\nat higher $p_T$.\n", "  We study direct and inverse scattering problem for systems of interacting\nparticles, having web-like structure. Such systems consist of a finite number\nof semi-infinite chains attached to the central part formed by a finite number\nof particles. We assume that the semi-infinite channels are homogeneous at\ninfinity, but the limit values of the coefficients may vary from one chain to\nanother.\n", "  We study evolutionary multi-player games in finite populations, subject to\nfluctuating environments. The population undergoes a birth-death process with\nabsorbing states, and the environment follows a Markovian process, resulting in\na fluctuating payoff matrix for the evolutionary game. Our focus is on the\nfixation or extinction of a single mutant in a population of wildtypes. We show\nthat the nonlinear nature of fitnesses in multi-player games gives rise to an\nintricate interplay of selection, genetic drift and environmental fluctuations.\nThis generates effects not seen in simpler two-player games. To analyse\ntrajectories towards fixation we analytically calculate sojourn times for\ngeneral birth-death processes in populations of two types of individuals and in\nfluctuating environments.\n", "  The increasing impact of fossil energy generation on the Earth ecological\nbalance is pointing to the need of a transition in power generation technology\ntowards the more clean and sustainable Renewable Energy Sources (RES). This\ntransition is leading to new paradigms and technologies useful for the\neffective energy transmission and distribution, which take into account the RES\nstochastic power output. In this scenario, the availability of up to date and\nreliable datasets regarding topological and operative parameters of power\nsystems in presence of RES are needed, for both proposing and testing new\nsolutions. In this spirit, I present here a dataset regarding the German 380 KV\ngrid which contains fully DC Power Flow operative states of the grid in the\npresence of various amounts of RES share, ranging from realistic up to 60\\%,\nwhich can be used as reference dataset for both steady state and dynamical\nanalysis.\n", "  When an interaction quench by a factor of four is applied to an attractive\nBose-Einstein condensate, a higher-order quantum bright soliton exhibiting\nrobust oscillations is predicted in the semiclassical limit by the\nGross-Pitaevskii equation. Combining matrix-product state simulations of the\nBose-Hubbard Hamiltonian with analytical treatment via the Lieb-Liniger model\nand the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, we show these oscillations are\nabsent. Instead, one obtains a large stationary soliton core with a small\nthermal cloud, a smoking-gun signal for non-semiclassical behavior on\nmacroscopic scales and therefore a fully quantum emergent phenomenon.\n", "  We study sequences (both cyclic and randomized) of idempotent\ncompletely-positive trace-preserving quantum maps, and show how they\nasymptotically converge to the intersection of their fixed point sets via\nalternating projection methods. We characterize the robustness features of the\nprotocol against randomization and provide basic bounds on its convergence\nspeed. The general results are then specialized to stabilizing en- tangled\nstates in finite-dimensional multipartite quantum systems subject to a resource\nconstraint, a problem of key interest for quantum information applications. We\nconclude by suggesting further developments, including techniques to enlarge\nthe set of stabilizable states and ensure efficient, finite-time preparation.\n", "  The QCD coupling, $\\alpha_s$, is not a physical observable since it depends\non conventions related to the renormalization procedure. Here we discuss a\nredefinition of the coupling where changes of scheme are parametrised by a\nsingle parameter $C$. The new coupling is denoted $\\hat \\alpha_s$ and its\nrunning is scheme independent. Moreover, scheme variations become completely\nanalogous to renormalization scale variations. We discuss how the coupling\n$\\hat \\alpha_s$ can be used in order to optimize predictions for the inclusive\nhadronic decays of the tau lepton. Preliminary investigations of the $C$-scheme\nin the presence of higher-order terms of the perturbative series are discussed\nhere for the first time.\n", "  The relationships among the pressure P, volume V, and temperature T of\nsolid-state materials are described by their equations of state (EOSs), which\nare often derived from the consideration of the finite-strain energy or the\ninteratomic potential.1-3 These EOSs consist of typically three parameters to\ndetermine from experimental P-V-T data by fitting analyses. In the empirical\napproach to EOSs, one either refines such fitting parameters or improves the\nmathematical functions3-5 to better simulate the experimental data. Despite\nover seven decades of studies on EOSs, none has been found to be accurate for\nall types of solids over the whole temperature and pressure ranges studied\nexperimentally.3,6,7 Here we show that the simple empirical EOS, P =\n{\\alpha}1(PV) + {\\alpha}2(PV)2 + {\\alpha}3(PV)3, in which the pressure P is\nindirectly related to the volume V through a cubic polynomial of the energy\nterm PV with three fitting parameters {\\alpha}1 - {\\alpha}3, provides accurate\ndescriptions for the P-vs-V data of condensed matter in a wide region of\npressure studied experimentally even in the presence of phase transitions\n", "  We use N-body simulations to quantify how the escape velocity in\ncluster-sized halos maps to the gravitational potential in a LambdaCDM\nuniverse. Using spherical density-potential pairs and the Poisson equation, we\nfind that the matter density inferred gravitational potential profile predicts\nthe escape velocity profile to within a few percent accuracy for group and\ncluster-sized halos (10^13 < M_200 < 10^15 M_sun, with respect to the critical\ndensity). The accuracy holds from just outside the core to beyond the virial\nradius. We show the importance of explicitly incorporating a cosmological\nconstant when inferring the potential from the Poisson equation. We consider\nthree density models and find that the Einasto and Gamma profiles provide a\nbetter joint estimate of the density and potential profiles than the Navarro,\nFrenk and White profile, which fails to accurately represent the escape\nvelocity. For individual halos, the 1 sigma scatter between the measured escape\nvelocity and the density-inferred potential profile is small (<5%). Finally,\nwhile the sub-halos show 15% biases in their representation of the particle\nvelocity dispersion profile, the sub-halo escape velocity profile matches the\ndark matter escape velocity profile to high accuracy with no evidence for\nvelocity bias outside 0.4r_200.\n", "  We introduce the concept of a metasurface system able to route space wave via\nsurface waves. This concept may be used to laterally shift or modulate the beam\nwidth of scattered waves. We propose two corresponding synthesis techniques,\none that is exact but leads to practically challenging material parameters and\none that is approximate but leads to simpler material parameters. The concept\nis experimentally verified in an electromagnetic periscope. Additionally, we\npropose two other potential applications namely a beam expander and a\nmulti-wave refractor.\n", "  We begin by discussing known theoretical results about the sensitivity of\nquantum states to changes in the value of Planck's constant h. These questions\nare related to positivity issues for self-adjoint trace class operators, which\nare not yet fully understood. We thereafter briefly discuss the implementation\nof experimental procedures to detect possible fluctuations of h.\n", "  In this work, we present a novel regularized L$_1$ (RL$_1$) finite element\nspatial discretization scheme for radiation transport problems. We review the\nrecently developed least-squares finite element method in nuclear applications.\nWe then derive an L$_1$ finite element by minimizing the L$_1$ norm of the\ntransport residual. To ensure the stability on incident boundary, we newly\ndevelop a consistent L$_1$ boundary condition (BC). The numerical tests\ndemonstrate such a method effectively prevents the oscillations which would\noccur to least-squares finite element when discontinuity exists such as void\nand absorber. Further, the RL$_1$ method is accurate in problems with\nscattering.\n", "  The control of the spin-Seebeck current is still a challenging task for the\ndevelopment of spin caloritronic devices. Here, we construct a spin-Seebeck\ndevice by inserting a strongly correlated quantum dot (QD) between the metal\nlead and magnetic insulator. Using the slave-particle approach and non-crossing\napproximation, we find that the spin-Seebeck effect increases significantly\nwhen the energy level of the QD locates near the Fermi level of the metal lead\ndue to the enhancement of spin flipping and occurrences of quantum resonance.\nSince this can be easily realized by applying a gate voltage in experiments,\nthe spin-Seebeck device proposed here can also work as a thermovoltaic\ntransistor. Moreover, the optimal correlation strength and the energy level\nposition of the QD are discussed to maximize the spin-Seebeck current as\nrequired for applications in controllable spin caloritronic devices.\n", "  Single crystal growth of {\\alpha}-Na$_x$MnO$_2$ (x = 0.90) is reported via\nthe floating zone technique. The conditions required for stable growth and\nintergrowth-free crystals are described along with the results of trials under\nalternate growth atmospheres. Chemical and structural characterizations of the\nresulting {\\alpha}-Na$_{0.90}$MnO$_2$ crystals are performed using ICP-AES,\nNMR, XANES, XPS, and neutron diffraction measurements. As a layered transition\nmetal oxide with large ionic mobility and strong correlation effects,\n{\\alpha}-Na$_x$MnO$_2$ is of interest to many communities, and the implications\nof large volume, high purity, single crystal growth are discussed.\n", "  Recently, Abedi, Dykaar and Afshordi claimed evidence for a repeating damped\necho signal following the binary black hole merger gravitational-wave events\nrecorded in the first observational period of the Advanced LIGO\ninterferometers. We discuss the methods of data analysis and significance\nestimation leading to this claim, and identify several important shortcomings.\nWe conclude that their analysis does not provide significant observational\nevidence for the existence of Planck-scale structure at black hole horizons,\nand suggest renewed analysis correcting for these shortcomings.\n"]}
