We\nanalyse the WiggleZ data in two ways: firstly using the full shape of the 2D\ncorrelation function and secondly focussing only on the position of the BAO\npeak in the reconstructed data set. When fitting for the full shape of the 2D\ncorrelation function we use a multipole expansion to compare with theory. When\nwe use the reconstructed data we marginalise over the shape and just measure\nthe position of the BAO peak, analysing the data in wedges separating the\nsignal along the line of sight from that parallel to the line of sight. We\nverify our method with mock data and find the results to be free of bias or\nsystematic offsets. We also redo the pre-reconstruction angle averaged (1D)\nWiggleZ BAO analysis with an improved covariance and present an updated result.\nThe final results are presented in the form of $\\Omega_c h^2$, $H(z)$, and\n$D_A(z)$ for three redshift bins with effective redshifts $z = 0.44$, $0.60$,\nand $0.73$. Within these bins and methodologies, we recover constraints between\n5% and 22% error. Our cosmological constraints are consistent with Flat\n$\\Lambda$CDM cosmology and agree with results from the Baryon Oscillation\nSpectroscopic Survey (BOSS).\n", "  We introduce an energy functional for ground-state electronic structure\ncalculations. Its variables are the natural spin-orbitals of singlet many-body\nwave functions and their joint occupation probabilities deriving from\ncontrolled approximations to the two-particle density matrix that yield\nalgebraic scaling in general, and Hartree-Fock scaling in its seniority-zero\nversion. Results from the latter version for small molecular systems are\ncompared with those of highly accurate quantum-chemical computations. The\nenergies lie above full configuration interaction calculations, close to doubly\noccupied configuration interaction calculations. Their accuracy is considerably\ngreater than that obtained from current density-functional theory\napproximations and from current functionals of the one-particle density matrix.\n", "  Status of tau lepton decay Monte Carlo generator TAUOLA, its main\napplications and recent developments are reviewed. It is underlined, that in\nrecent efforts on development of new hadronic currents, the multi-dimensional\nnature of distributions of the experimental data must be taken with a great\ncare: lesson from comparison and fits to the BaBar and Belle data is recalled.\nIt was found, that as in the past at a time of comparisons with CLEO and ALEPH\ndata, proper fitting, to as detailed as possible representation of the\nexperimental data, is essential for appropriate developments of models of tau\ndecay dynamic.\n  This multi-dimensional nature of distributions is also important for\nobservables where tau leptons are used to constrain experimental data. In later\npart of the presentation,use of the TAUOLA program for phenomenology of W,Z,H\ndecays at LHC is addressed, in particular in the context of the Higgs boson\nparity measurements. Some new results, relevant for QED lepton pair emission\nare mentioned as well.\n", "  A first measurement of the top quark spin asymmetry, sensitive to the top\nquark polarisation, in $t$-channel single top quark production is presented. It\nis based on a sample of pp collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV\ncorresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 $\\mathrm{fb^{-1}}$. A\nhigh-purity sample of $t$-channel single top quark events with an isolated muon\nis selected. Signal and background components are estimated using a fit to\ndata. A differential cross section measurement, corrected for detector effects,\nof an angular observable sensitive to the top quark polarisation is performed.\nThe differential distribution is used to extract a top quark spin asymmetry of\n$0.26 \\pm 0.03 \\textrm{(stat)} \\pm 0.10 \\textrm{(syst)}$, which is compatible\nwith a p-value of $4.6\\%$ with the standard model prediction of 0.44.\n", "  In this paper, we have developed a new measure of understanding the temporal\nevolution of phase synchronization for EEG signals using cross-electrode\ninformation. From this measure it is found that there exists a small number of\nwell-defined phase-synchronized states, each of which is stable for few\nmilliseconds during the execution of a face perception task. We termed these\nquasi-stable states as synchrostates. We used k-means clustering algorithms to\nestimate the optimal number of synchrostates from 100 trials of EEG signals\nover 128 channels. Our results show that these synchrostates exist consistently\nin all the different trials. It is also found that from the onset of the\nstimulus, switching between these synchrostates results in well-behaved\ntemporal sequence with repeatability which may be indicative of the dynamics of\nthe cognitive process underlying that task. Therefore these synchrostates and\ntheir temporal switching sequences may be used as a new measure of the\nstability of phase synchrony and information exchange between different regions\nof a human brain.\n", "  In this paper we utilized the concept of stable phase synchronization\ntopography - synchrostates - over the scalp derived from EEG recording for\nformulating brain connectivity network in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and\ntypically-growing children. A synchronization index is adapted for forming the\nedges of the connectivity graph capturing the stability of each of the\nsynchrostates. Such network is formed for 11 ASD and 12 control group children.\nComparative analyses of these networks using graph theoretic measures show that\nchildren with autism have a different modularity of such networks from typical\nchildren. This result could pave the way to a new modality for possible\nidentification of ASD from non-invasively recorded EEG data.\n", "  Tourism is one of the most important economic activities in the world: for\nmany countries it represents the single largest product in their export basket.\nHowever, it is a product difficult to chart: \"exporters\" of tourism do not ship\nit abroad, but they welcome importers inside the country. Current research uses\nsocial accounting matrices and general equilibrium models, but the standard\nindustry classifications they use make it hard to identify which domestic\nindustries cater to foreign visitors. In this paper, we make use of open source\ndata and of anonymized and aggregated transaction data giving us insights about\nthe spend behavior of foreigners inside two countries, Colombia and the\nNetherlands, to inform our research. With this data, we are able to describe\nwhat constitutes the tourism sector, and to map the most attractive\ndestinations for visitors. In particular, we find that countries might observe\ndifferent geographical tourists' patterns -- concentration versus\ndecentralization --; we show the importance of distance, a country's reported\nwealth and cultural affinity in informing tourism; and we show the potential of\ncombining open source data and anonymized and aggregated transaction data on\nforeign spend patterns in gaining insight as to the evolution of tourism from\none year to another.\n", "  Like a three-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger(GHZ) symmetry we explore a\ncorresponding symmetry in the four-qubit system, which we call GHZ$_4$\nsymmetry. While whole GHZ-symmetric states can be represented by two real\nparameters, the whole set of the GHZ$_4$-symmetric states is represented by\nthree real parameters. In the parameter space all GHZ$_4$-symmetric states\nreside inside a tetrahedron. We also explore a question where the given SLOCC\nclass of the GHZ$_4$-symmetric states resides in the tetrahedron. Among nine\nSLOCC classes we have examined five SLOCC classes, which results in three\nlinear hierarchies $L_{abc_2} \\subset L_{a_4} \\subset L_{a_2b_2} \\subset\nG_{abcd}$, $L_{a_20_{3\\oplus\\bar{1}}} \\subset G_{abcd}$, and\n$L_{0_{3\\oplus\\bar{1}}0_{3\\oplus\\bar{1}}} \\subset G_{abcd}$ which hold, at\nleast, in the whole set of the GHZ$_4$-symmetric states. Difficulties arising\nin the analysis of the remaining SLOCC classes are briefly discussed.\n", "  Quantum transport properties are instrumental to understanding quantum\ncoherent transport processes. Potential applications of quantum transport are\nwidespread, in areas ranging from quantum information science to quantum\nengineering, and not restricted to quantum state transfer, control and\nmanipulation. Here, we study light transport in a ring array of coupled\nresonators enclosed synthetic magnetic flux. The ring configuration, with an\narbitrary number of resonators embedded, forms an two-arm Aharonov-Bohm\ninterferometer. The influence of magnetic flux on light transport is\ninvestigated. Tuning the magnetic flux can lead to resonant transmission, while\nhalf-integer magnetic flux quantum leads to completely destructive interference\nand transmission zeros in an interferometer with two equal arms.\n", "  What is the real role of the quantum coherence and entanglement in the\nradical pair (RP) compass, and what determines the singlet yield have not been\nfully understood. In this paper, we find that the dark states of the\ntwo-electron Zeeman energy operator (TEZE) play an important role in the RP\ncompass. We respectively calculate the singlet yields for two initial states in\nthis dark state basis: the coherent state and the same state just removing the\ndark state coherence. For the later there is neither dark state coherence nor\nentanglement in the whole dynamical process. Surprisingly we find that in both\ncases the singlet yields are the same, and based on this result, we believe\nthat the dark state population determines the singlet yield completely, and the\ndark state coherence and entanglement have little contribution to it. Finally,\nwe also find that the dark state population as well as the singlet yield\nanisotropy is fragile to the vertical magnetic noise. However, the orientation\nis robust and is even enhanced by the parallel magnetic noise because the dark\nstates expand a decoherence-free subspace. The dark state population as well as\nthe orientation is more robust to the hyperfine coupling noise.\n", "  Sr substituted perovskites La1.8Sr0.2MMnO6 (M = Ni, Co) were synthesized\nusing solid state reaction technique to present a systematic study on their\nmorphological, structural and magnetic properties. The average grain size of\nthe as-prepared La1.8Sr0.2NiMnO6 samples are in the range of 0.2-0.7 {\\mu}m and\nthose for La1.8Sr0.2CoMnO6 manganites are 0.1-2.8 {\\mu}m, which is\nsignificantly less than that of unsubstituted La2NiMnO6 (LNMO) and La2CoMnO6\n(LCMO) manganites. The XPS analysis enlightened about phase purity, binding\nenergy and oxygen vacancy of La1.8Sr0.2MMnO6 manganites. The Sr substituted\nLNMO has revealed a sharp ferromagnetic to paramagnetic phase transition at 160\nK which is about 120 K less than that of parent LNMO. The Sr substituted LCMO\nexhibited such a transition at 220 K which is 8 K less than that of parent\nLCMO. The temperature dependent magnetization measurements suggest that the\neffect of Sr on the transition temperature in LNMO is more significant than\nthat of LCMO.\n", "  The outcome of many social and economic interactions, such as stock-market\ntransactions, is strongly determined by the predictions that agents make about\nthe behavior of other individuals. Cognitive Hierarchy Theory provides a\nframework to model the consequences of forecasting accuracy that has proven to\nfit data from certain types of game theory experiments, such as Keynesian\nBeauty Contests and Entry Games. Here, we focus on symmetric\ntwo-players-two-actions games and establish an algorithm to find the players'\nstrategies according to the Cognitive Hierarchy Approach. We show that the\nSnowdrift Game exhibits a pattern of behavior whose complexity grows as the\ncognitive levels of players increases. In addition to finding the solutions up\nto the third cognitive level, we demonstrate, in this theoretical frame, two\nnew properties of snowdrift games: i) any snowdrift game can be characterized\nby only a parameter -- its class, ii) they are anti-symmetric with respect to\nthe diagonal of the pay-off's space. Finally, we propose a model based on an\nevolutionary dynamics that captures the main features of the Cognitive\nHierarchy Theory.\n", "  For the weakly interacting one-dimensional multi-particle Anderson model in\nthe continuum space of configurations, we prove the spectral exponential and\nthe strong dynamical localization. The results require the interaction\namplitude to be sufficiently small. The general strategy uses the multi-scale\nanalysis bounds. Actually, we show that the multi-scale analysis bounds of the\nsingle particle model remain stable when passing to multi-particle systems,\nprovided that the inter-particle interaction is sufficiently small. The common\nprobability distribution of the i.i.d. random external potential in the\nAnderson model, is only needed to be log-H\\\"older continuous.\n", "  In Carrasco et al. we have recently proposed a method to calculate $O(e^2)$\nelectromagnetic corrections to leptonic decay widths of pseudoscalar mesons.\nThe method is based on the observation that the infrared divergent\ncontributions (that appear at intermediate stages of the calculation and that\ncancel in physical quantities thanks to the Bloch-Nordsieck mechanism) are\nuniversal, i.e. depend on the charge and the mass of the meson but not on its\ninternal structure. In this talk we perform a detailed analysis of the\nfinite-volume effects associated with our method. In particular we show that\nalso the leading $1/L$ finite-volume effects are universal and perform an\nanalytical calculation of the finite-volume leptonic decay rate for a\npoint-like meson.\n", "  For theories formulated with a maximally symmetric momentum space we propose\na general characterization for the description of interactions in terms of the\nisometry group of the momentum space. The well known cases of\n$\\kappa$-Poincar\\'e-inspired and (2+1)-dimensional gravity-inspired composition\nlaws both satisfy our condition. Future applications might include the proposal\nof a class of models based on momenta spaces with anti-de Sitter geometry.\n"]}
