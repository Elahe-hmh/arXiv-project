Correction factors for the mean square\nradius of electrons are calculated for the experimental conditions of KASCADE\narray. Possible improvement of the primary mass discrimination by analysis of\nlateral distribution of EAS electrons is discussed in detail.\n", "  Symmetry is a fundamentally important concept in many branches of physics. In\nthis work, we discuss two types of symmetries, external symmetry and internal\nsymmetry, which appear frequently in controlled quantum spin chains and apply\nthem to study various controllability problems. For spin chains under single\nlocal end control when external symmetries exists, we can rigorously prove that\nthe system is controllable in each of the invariant subspaces for both XXZ and\nXYZ chains, but not for XX or Ising chains. Such results have direct\napplications in controlling antiferromagnetic Heisenberg chains when the\ndynamics is naturally confined in the largest excitation subspace. We also\naddress the theoretically important question of minimal control resources to\nachieve full controllability over the entire spin chain space. In the process\nwe establish a systematic way of evaluating the dynamical Lie algebras and\nusing known symmetries to help identify the dynamical Lie algebra.\n", "  We study properties of basic solutions in systems with dime delays and\n$S^1$-symmetry. Such basic solutions are relative equilibria (CW solutions) and\nrelative periodic solutions (MW solutions). It follows from the previous theory\nthat the number of CW solutions grows generically linearly with time delay\n$\\tau$. Here we show, in particular, that the number of relative periodic\nsolutions grows generically as $\\tau^2$ when delay increases. Thus, in such\nsystems, the relative periodic solutions are more abundant than relative\nequilibria. The results are directly applicable to, e.g., Lang-Kobayashi model\nfor the lasers with delayed feedback. We also study stability properties of the\nsolutions for large delays.\n", "  Inter satellite laser interferometry is a central component of future\nspace-borne gravity instruments like LISA, eLISA, NGO and future geodesy\nmissions. The inherently small laser wavelength allows to measure distance\nvariations with extremely high precision by interfering a reference beam with a\nmeasurement beam. The readout of such interferometers is often based on\ntracking phasemeters, able to measure the phase of an incoming beatnote with\nhigh precision over a wide range of frequencies. The implementation of such\nphasemeters is based on all digital phase-locked loops, hosted in FPGAs. Here\nwe present a precise model of an all digital phase locked loop that allows to\ndesign such a readout algorithm and we support our analysis by numerical\nperformance measurements and experiments with analog signals.\n", "  We report on the magnetic and superconducting properties of LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 by\nmeans of zero- (ZF) and transverse-field (TF) muon-spin spectroscopy\nmeasurements (uSR). Contrary to previous results on iron-based superconductors,\nmeasurements in zero field demonstrate the absence of magnetically ordered\nphases. TF-uSR data give access to the superfluid density, which shows a marked\n2D character with a dominant s-wave temperature behavior. The field dependence\nof the magnetic penetration depth confirms this finding and further suggests\nthe presence of an anisotropic superconducting gap.\n", "  We consider the discrete one-dimensional Schr\\\"{o}dinger operator $H=H_0+V$,\nwhere $(H_0x)[n]=-(x[n+1]+x[n-1]-2x[n])$ and $V$ is a self-adjoint operator on\n$\\ell^2(\\mathbb{Z})$ with a decay property given by $V$ extending to a compact\noperator from $\\ell^{\\infty,-\\beta}(\\mathbb{Z})$ to\n$\\ell^{1,\\beta}(\\mathbb{Z})$ for some $\\beta\\geq1$. We give a complete\ndescription of the solutions to $Hx=0$, and $Hx=4x$,\n$x\\in\\ell^{\\infty,-\\beta}(\\mathbb{Z})$. Using this description we give\nasymptotic expansions of the resolvent of $H$ at the two thresholds $0$ and\n$4$. One of the main results is a precise correspondence between the solutions\nto $Hx=0$ and the leading coefficients in the asymptotic expansion of the\nresolvent around $0$. For the resolvent expansion we implement the expansion\nscheme of Jensen-Nenciu \\cite{JN0, JN1} in the full generality.\n", "  Scaling properties of nuclei- and photon-initiated air showers are examined\nin wide primary energy range ($10^{14}\\div 10^{22}$~eV) taking into account\nLandau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal and geomagnetic field effects. It is shown that the\ninvariance in lateral distribution and also the universal dependence between\nshower age and root mean square radius of electron component exist up to the\nhighest energies. The implications of shower universality for reanalysis,\ncross-checking and validation of the results of different experiments together\nwith decreasing of the influence of hadronic model uncertainties are discussed\nin detail.\n", "  The swimming of a circular disk at low Reynolds number is studied for\ndistortion waves along its two planar surfaces with wavelength much smaller\nthan the size of the disk. The calculation is based on an extension of Taylor's\nwork for a planar sheet. It is shown that in general the disk performs both\ntranslational and rotational swimming, resulting in a circular orbit.\n", "  We ask whether or not thermal light can be represented as a mixture of single\nbroadband coherent pulses. We find that it cannot. Such a mixture is simply not\nrich enough to mimic thermal light; indeed, it cannot even reproduce the\nfirst-order correlation function. We show that it is possible to construct a\nmodified mixture of single coherent pulses that does yield the correct\nfirst-order correlation function at equal space points. However, as we then\ndemonstrate, such a mixture cannot reproduce the second-order correlation\nfunction.\n", "  Non-equilibrium (NE) molecular dynamics (MD), or NEMD, gives a \"direct\"\nsimulation of thermal conductivity kappa. Heat H(x) is added and subtracted in\nequal amounts at different places x. After steady state is achieved, the\ntemperature T(x) is found by averaging over finite sections. Usually the aim is\nto extract a value of dT/dx from a place distant from sources and sinks of\nheat. This yields an effective kappa(L) for the thermal conductivity, L being\nthe system size. The result is then studied as a function of L, to extract the\nbulk limit kappa. Here instead, our heat is H(x)~sin(qx), where q=2pi/L. This\ncauses a steady-state temperature T_0 + Delta T sin(2pi x/L). A thermal\nconductivity kappa(q) is extracted, which is well converged at the chosen q (or\nL). Bulk conductivity kappa requires taking the q to 0 limit. The method is\ntested for liquid and crystalline argon. One advantage is reduced computational\nnoise at a given total MD run time. Another advantage is that kappa(q) has a\nmore physical meaning than kappa(L). It can be easily studied using\nPeierls-Boltzmann transport theory. New formulas for kappa(q) in simplified\nDebye-type models give new insight about extrapolation to q to 0 or 1/L to 0.\nIn particular, it is shown that kappa(L$ is unlikely to behave as kappa -C/L,\nand much more likely to behave as kappa-C'/sqrt(L). Convergence problems\nencountered in computational cells with very large aspect ratios\nL(parallel)/L(perp) are also analyzed. Some details are contained in the\n\"Supplemental Material\" file.\n", "  We consider preheating in models in which the potential for the inflaton is\ngiven by a fractional power, as is the case in axion monodromy inflation. We\nassume a standard coupling between the inflaton field and a scalar matter\nfield. We find that in spite of the fact that the oscillation of the inflaton\nabout the field value which minimizes the potential is anharmonic, there is\nnevertheless a parametric resonance instability, and we determine the Floquet\nexponent which describes this instability as a function of the parameters of\nthe inflaton potential.\n", "  The production of triple Higgs $(H^+H^-H^0)$, $(H^+H^-h^0)$ and pair wise\ncharged Higgs boson $(H^+H^-)$ is studied in the context of future linear\ncolliders within the Two-Higgs Doublet Model (2HDM) type II. The aim is to\ncompare sources of charged Higgs pair through the above processes, i.e., double\nand triple Higgs production. Cross-sections are calculated at the leading order\nin 2HDM type II and Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM). Several\norders of magnitude ($\\sim 10^{4}$) enhancement is observed in 2HDM compared to\nMSSM, while no sizable enhancement is seen in muon collider versus\nelectron-positron collider. The analysis is based on a heavy charged Higgs with\nmass above 500 GeV. It is found that double charged Higgs production\ncross-section (being the same in 2HDM and MSSM) is few femtobarns while the\ntriple Higgs production can not exceed a fraction of femtobarn within the\nparameter space under study.\n", "  Recently it has been shown by exclusive and kinematically complete\nexperiments that the appearance of a narrow resonance structure in\ndouble-pionic fusion reactions is strictly correlated with the appearance of\nthe so-called ABC effect, which denotes a pronounced low-mass enhancement in\nthe $\\pi\\pi$-invariant mass spectrum. Whereas the resonance structure got its\nexplanation by the $d^*(2380)$ dibaryonic resonance, a satisfactory explanation\nfor the ABC effect is still pending. In this paper we discuss possible\nexplanations of the ABC effect and their consequences for the internal\nstructure of the $d^*$ dibaryon.\n", "  We present an optomechanical accelerometer with high dynamic range, high\nbandwidth and read-out noise levels below 8 ${\\mu}$g/$\\sqrt{\\mathrm{Hz}}$. The\nstraightforward assembly and low cost of our device make it a prime candidate\nfor on-site reference calibrations and autonomous navigation. We present\nexperimental data taken with a vacuum sealed, portable prototype and deduce the\nachieved bias stability and scale factor accuracy. Additionally, we present a\ncomprehensive model of the device physics that we use to analyze the\nfundamental noise sources and accuracy limitations of such devices.\n", "  We investigate the analogy between magnetism and rotation in relativistic\ntheory. In nonrelativistic theory, the exact correspondence between magnetism\nand rotation is established in the presence of an external trapping potential.\nBased on this, we analyze relativistic rotation under external trapping\npotentials. A Landau-like quantization is obtained by considering an\nenergy-dependent potential.\n", "  A monolithic multi-channel analog transient recorder, implemented using\nswitched capacitor sample-and-hold circuits and a high-speed\nanalogically-adjustable delay-line-based write clock, has been designed,\nfabricated and tested. The 2.1 by 6.9 mm layout, in 1.2 micron CMOS, includes\nover 31,000 transistors and 2048 double polysilicon capacitors. The circuit\ncontains four parallel channels, each with a 512 deep switched-capacitor\nsample-and-hold system. A 512 deep edge sensitive tapped active delay line uses\nlook-ahead and 16 way interleaving to develop the 512 sample and hold clocks,\neach as little as 3.2 ns wide and 200 ps apart. Measurements of the device have\ndemonstrated 5 GHz maximum sample rate, at least 350 MHz bandwidth, an\nextrapolated rms aperture uncertainty per sample of 0.7 ps, and a signal to rms\nnoise ratio of 2000:1.\n", "  Precision phase readout of optical beat note signals is one of the core\ntechniques required for intersatellite laser interferometry. Future space based\ngravitational wave detectors like eLISA require such a readout over a wide\nrange of MHz frequencies, due to orbit induced Doppler shifts, with a precision\nin the order of $\\mu \\textrm{rad}/\\sqrt{\\textrm{Hz}}$ at frequencies between\n$0.1\\,\\textrm{mHz}$ and $1\\,\\textrm{Hz}$. In this paper, we present phase\nreadout systems, so-called phasemeters, that are able to achieve such\nprecisions and we discuss various means that have been employed to reduce noise\nin the analogue circuit domain and during digitisation. We also discuss the\ninfluence of some non-linear noise sources in the analogue domain of such\nphasemeters. And finally, we present the performance that was achieved during\ntesting of the elegant breadboard model of the LISA phasemeter, that was\ndeveloped in the scope of an ESA technology development activity.\n", "  The design and performance of a fully-synchronous multi-GHz analog transient\nwaveform recorder I.C. (\"SST\") with fast and flexible trigger capabilities is\npresented. The SST's objective is to provide multi-GHz sample rates with\nintrinsically-stable timing, Nyquist-rate sampling and high trigger bandwidth,\nwide dynamic range and simple operation. Containing 4 channels of 256 samples\nper channel, the SST is fabricated in an inexpensive 0.25 micrometer CMOS\nprocess and uses a high-performance package that is 8 mm on a side. It has a\n1.9V input range on a 2.5V supply, exceeds 12 bits of dynamic range, and uses\n~128 mW while operating at 2 G-samples/s and full trigger rates. With a\nstandard 50 Ohm input source, the SST exceeds ~1.5 GHz -3 dB bandwidth. The\nSST's internal sample clocks are generated synchronously via a shift register\ndriven by an external LVDS oscillator running at half the sample rate (e.g., a\n1 GHz oscillator yields 2 G-samples/s). Because of its purely-digital\nsynchronous nature, the SST has ps-level timing uniformity that is independent\nof sample frequencies spanning over 6 orders of magnitude: from under 2 kHz to\nover 2 GHz. Only three active control lines are necessary for operation: Reset,\nStart/Stop and Read-Clock. When operating as common-stop device, the time of\nthe stop, modulo 256 relative to the start, is read out along with the sampled\nsignal values. Each of the four channels integrates dual-threshold trigger\ncircuitry with windowed coincidence features. Channels can discriminate signals\nwith ~1mV RMS resolution at >600 MHz bandwidth.\n", "  We analyze the Higgs sector of the minimal $S(3)$-invariant extension of the\nStandard Model including CP violation arising from the spontaneous electroweak\nsymmetry breaking. This extended Higgs sector includes three SU(2) doublets\nHiggs fields with complex vev's providing an interesting scenario to analyze\nthe Higgs masses spectrum, trilinear Higgs self-couplings and CP violation. We\npresent how the spontaneous electroweak symmetry breaking coming from three\n$S(3)$ Higgs fields gives an interesting scenario with nine physical Higgs and\nthree Goldstone bosons when spontaneous CP violation arises from the Higgs\nfield $S(3)$ singlet $H_S$. Furthermore, a numerical analysis of the Higgs\nmasses and trilinear Higgs self-couplings is presented. Particularly, we find a\nphysical solution for the scenario in which spontaneous CPB is provided by\n$H_S$. In this scheme, the scalar Higgs $H^0_1$ is identified, whose mass is\n125 GeV and $\\lambda_{H_{1}^0 H_{1}^0 H_{1}^0} \\sim \\lambda_{h^0 h^0\nh^0}^{SM}$.\n", "  Decomposition analysis is a critical tool for understanding the social and\nspatial dimensions of inequality, segregation, and diversity. In this paper, I\npropose a new measure - the Divergence Index - to address the need for a\ndecomposable measure of segregation. Although the Information Theory Index has\nbeen used to decompose segregation within and between communities, I argue that\nit measures relative diversity not segregation. I demonstrate the importance of\nthis conceptual distinction with two empirical analyses: I decompose\nsegregation and relative homogeneity in the Detroit metropolitan area, and I\nanalyze the relationship between the indexes in the 100 largest U.S. cities. I\nshow that it is problematic to interpret the Information Theory Index as a\nmeasure of segregation, especially when analyzing local-level results or any\ndecomposition of overall results. Segregation and diversity are important\naspects of residential differentiation, and it is critical that we study each\nconcept as the structure and stratification of the U.S. population becomes more\ncomplex.\n", "  The design and performance of a multi-G-sample/s fully-synchronous analog\ntransient waveform recorder I.C. (\"SST\") with fast and flexible trigger\ncapabilities is presented. Containing 4 channels of 256 samples per channel and\nfabricated in a 0.25 {\\mu}m CMOS process, it has a 1.9V input range on a 2.5V\nsupply, achieves 12 bits of dynamic range, and uses ~160 mW while operating at\n2 G-samples/s and full trigger speeds. With a standard 50 Ohm input source, the\nSST's analog input bandwidth is ~1.3 GHz within about +/-0.5 dB and reaches a\n-3 dB bandwidth of 1.5 GHz. The SST's internal sample clocks are generated\nsynchronously via a shift register driven by an external LVDS oscillator,\ninterleaved to double its speed (e.g., a 1 GHz clock yields 2 G-samples/s). It\ncan operate over 6 orders of magnitude in sample rates (2 kHz to 2 GHz). Only\nthree active control lines are necessary for operation: Reset, Start/Stop and\nRead-Clock. Each of the four channels integrates dual-threshold discrimination\nof signals with ~1 mV RMS resolution at >600 MHz bandwidth. Comparator results\nare directly available for simple threshold monitoring and rate control. The\nHigh and Low discrimination can also be AND'd over an adjustable window of time\nin order to exclusively trigger on bipolar impulsive signals. Trigger outputs\ncan be CMOS or low-voltage differential signals, e.g. 1.2V CMOS or positive-ECL\n(0-0.8V) for low noise. After calibration, the imprecision of timing\ndifferences between channels falls in a range of 1.12-2.37 ps sigma at 2\nG-samples/s.\n", "  We consider the one parameter family $\\alpha \\mapsto T_\\alpha$ ($\\alpha \\in\n[0,1)$) of Pomeau-Manneville type interval maps $T_\\alpha(x)=x(1+2^\\alpha\nx^\\alpha)$ for $x \\in [0,1/2)$ and $T_\\alpha(x)=2x-1$ for $x \\in [1/2, 1]$,\nwith the associated absolutely continuous invariant probability measure\n$\\mu_\\alpha$. For $\\alpha \\in (0,1)$, Sarig and Gou\\\"ezel proved that the\nsystem mixes only polynomially with rate $n^{1-1/\\alpha}$ (in particular, there\nis no spectral gap). We show that for any $\\psi\\in L^q$, the map $\\alpha \\to\n\\int_0^1 \\psi\\, d\\mu_\\alpha$ is differentiable on $[0,1-1/q)$, and we give a\n(linear response) formula for the value of the derivative. This is the first\ntime that a linear response formula for the SRB measure is obtained in the\nsetting of slowly mixing dynamics. Our argument shows how cone techniques can\nbe used in this context. For $\\alpha \\ge 1/2$ we need the $n^{-1/\\alpha}$\ndecorrelation obtained by Gou\\\"ezel under additional conditions.\n", "  It is understood that congestion in traffic can be interpreted in terms of\nthe instability of the equation of dynamic motion. The evolution of a traffic\nsystem from an unstable or metastable state to a globally stable state bears a\nstrong resemblance to the phase transition in thermodynamics. In this work, we\nexplore the underlying physics of the traffic system, by examining closely the\nphysical properties and mathematical constraints of the phase transitions\ntherein. By using a mesoscopic approach, one entitles the catastrophe model the\nsame physical content as in the Landau's theory, and uncovers its close\nconnections to the instability of the equation of motion and to the transition\nbetween different traffic states. In addition to the one-dimensional\nconfiguration space, we generalize our discussions to the higher-dimensional\ncase, where the observed temporal oscillation in traffic flow data is\nattributed to the curl of a vector field. We exhibit that our model can\nreproduce the main features of the observed fundamental diagram including the\ninverse-$\\lambda$ shape and the wide scattering of congested traffic data. When\nproperly parameterized, the main feature of the data can be reproduced\nreasonably well either in terms of the oscillating congested traffic or in\nterms of the synchronized flow.\n", "  We investigate causality constraints on the time evolution of entanglement\nentropy after a global quench in relativistic theories. We first provide a\ngeneral proof that the so-called tsunami velocity is bounded by the speed of\nlight. We then generalize the free particle streaming model of\narXiv:cond-mat/0503393 to general dimensions and to an arbitrary entanglement\npattern of the initial state. In more than two spacetime dimensions the spread\nof entanglement in these models is highly sensitive to the initial entanglement\npattern, but we are able to prove an upper bound on the normalized rate of\ngrowth of entanglement entropy, and hence the tsunami velocity. The bound is\nsmaller than what one gets for quenches in holographic theories, which\nhighlights the importance of interactions in the spread of entanglement in\nmany-body systems. We propose an interacting model which we believe provides an\nupper bound on the spread of entanglement for interacting relativistic\ntheories. In two spacetime dimensions with multiple intervals, this model and\nits variations are able to reproduce intricate results exhibited by holographic\ntheories for a significant part of the parameter space. For higher dimensions,\nthe model bounds the tsunami velocity at the speed of light. Finally, we\nconstruct a geometric model for entanglement propagation based on a tensor\nnetwork construction for global quenches.\n", "  Plasma turbulence is ubiquitous in space and astrophysical plasmas, playing\nan important role in plasma energization, but the physical mechanisms leading\nto dissipation of the turbulent energy remain to be definitively identified.\nKinetic simulations in two dimensions (2D) have been extensively used to study\nthe dissipation process. How the limitation to 2D affects energy dissipation\nremains unclear. This work provides a model of comparison between two- and\nthree-dimensional (3D) plasma turbulence using gyrokinetic simulations; it also\nexplores the dynamics of distribution functions during the dissipation process.\nIt is found that both 2D and 3D nonlinear gyrokinetic simulations of a low-beta\nplasma generate electron velocity-space structures with the same\ncharacteristics as that of linear Landau damping of Alfv\\'en waves in a 3D\nlinear simulation. The continual occurrence of the velocity-space structures\nthroughout the turbulence simulations suggests that the action of Landau\ndamping may be responsible for the turbulent energy transfer to electrons in\nboth 2D and 3D, and makes possible the subsequent irreversible heating of the\nplasma through collisional smoothing of the velocity-space fluctuations.\nAlthough, in the 2D case where variation along the equilibrium magnetic field\nis absent, it may be expected that Landau damping is not possible, a common\ntrigonometric factor appears in the 2D resonant denominator, leaving the\nresonance condition unchanged from the 3D case. The evolution of the 2D and 3D\ncases is qualitatively similar. However, quantitatively the nonlinear energy\ncascade and subsequent dissipation is significantly slower in the 2D case.\n", "  We report the first experimental observation of the quenching of the\nsuperconducting state in current-voltage characteristics of an iron-based\nsuperconductor, namely, in FeSeTe thin films. Based on available theoretical\nmodels, our analysis suggests the presence of an intrinsic flux-flow electronic\ninstability along with non-negligible extrinsic thermal effects. The\ncoexistence and competition of these two mechanisms classify the observed\ninstability as halfway between those of low-temperature and of high-temperature\nsuperconductors, where thermal effects are respectively largely negligible or\npredominant.\n", "  We demonstrate that a field effect transistor (FET) made of few layer black\nphosphorus (BP) encapsulated in hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) in vacuum,\nexhibts the room temperature hole mobility of 5200 $cm^2/Vs$ being limited just\nby the phonon scattering. At cryogenic tempeature the FET mobility increases up\nto 45,000 $cm^2/Vs$, which is eight times higher compared with the mobility\nobtained in earlier reports. The unprecedentedly clean h-BN/BP/h-BN\nheterostructure exhibits Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations and quantum Hall effect\nwith Landau level (LL) filling factors down to v=2 in conventional laboratory\nmagnetic fields. Moreover, carrier density independent effective mass m=0.26\nm_0 is measured, and Lande g-factor g=2.47 is reported. Furthermore, an\nindication for a distinct hole transport behavior with up and down spin\norientation is found.\n", "  Can topological quantum entanglement between anyons in one topological medium\n\"stray\" into a different, topologically distinct medium? In other words, can\nquantum information encoded non-locally in the combined state of non-Abelian\nanyons be shared between two distinct topological media? We consider a setup\nwith two p-wave superconductors of opposite chirality and demonstrate that such\nscenario is indeed possible. The information encoded in the fermionic parity of\ntwo Majorana zero modes, originally within the same superconducting domain, can\nbe shared between the domains or moved entirely from one domain to another\nprovided that vortices can tunnel between them in a controlled fashion.\n", "  We will consider the high frequency behaviour of distorted plane waves on\nmanifolds of nonpositive curvature which are Euclidean or hyperbolic near\ninfinity, under the assumption that the curvature is negative close to the\ntrapped set of the geodesic flow and that the topological pressure associated\nto half the unstable Jacobian is negative.\n  We obtain a precise expression for distorted plane waves in the high\nfrequency limit, similar to the one in \\cite{GN} in the case of convex\nco-compact manifolds. In particular, we will show $L_{loc}^\\infty$ bounds on\ndistorted plane waves that are uniform with frequency. We will also show that\nthe real part of distorted plane waves restricted to a compact set satisfy the\nanalogue of Yau's conjecture about the Haussdorff measure of nodal sets.\n", "  Multiplicity distributions $P(N)$ measured in multiparticle production\nprocesses are most frequently described by the Negative Binomial Distribution\n(NBD). However, with increasing collision energy some systematic discrepancies\nbecome more and more apparent. They are usually attributed to the possible\nmulti-source structure of the production process and described using a\nmulti-NBD form of the multiplicity distribution. We investigate the possibility\nof keeping a single NBD but with its parameters depending on the multiplicity\n$N$. This is done by modifying the widely known clan model of particle\nproduction leading to the NBD form of $P(N)$. This is then confronted with the\napproach based on the so-called cascade-stochastic formalism which is based on\ndifferent types of recurrence relations defining $P(N)$. We demonstrate that a\ncombination of both approaches allows the retrieval of additional valuable\ninformation from the multiplicity distributions, namely the oscillatory\nbehavior of the counting statistics apparently visible in the high energy data.\n", "  Neutrino oscillations are a widely observed and well established phenomenon.\nIt is also well known that deviations with respect to flavor conversion\nprobabilities in vacuum arise due to neutrino interactions with matter. In this\nwork, we analyze the impact of new interactions between neutrinos and the dark\nmatter present in the Milky Way on the neutrino oscillation pattern. The dark\nmatter-neutrino interaction is modeled by using an effective coupling\nproportional to the Fermi constant $G_F$ with no further restrictions on its\nflavor structure. For the galactic dark matter profile we consider an\nhomogeneous distribution as well as several density profiles, estimating in all\ncases the size of the interaction required to get an observable effect at\ndifferent neutrino energies. Our discussion is mainly focused in the PeV\nneutrino energy range, to be explored in observatories like IceCube and KM3NeT.\nThe obtained results may be interpreted in terms of a light\n$\\mathcal{O}$(sub-eV--keV) or WIMP-like dark matter particle or as a new\ninteraction with a mediator of $\\mathcal{O}$(sub-eV--keV) mass.\n", "  We prove an equidistribution result for the eigenvalues of the scattering\nmatrix associated to an operator of the form $-h^2\\Delta + V-1$, where $V\\in\nC_c^\\infty(\\mathbb{R}^d)$ is a compactly supported potential, under the\nassumption that the incoming and outgoing sets of the classical dynamics have\nzero Liouville measure. This extends a recent result of Gell-Redman, Hassell\nand Zelditch, where the authors proved equidistribution of the eigenvalues of\nthe scattering matrix under the assumption that the trapped set is empty.\n", "  Laser melting of semiconductors has been observed for almost 40 years;\nsurprisingly, it is not well understood where most theoretical simulations show\na laser-induced thermal process. $\\textit{Ab initio}$ nonadiabatic simulations\nbased on real-time time-dependent density functional theory reveal intrinsic\nnonthermal melting of silicon, at a temperature far below the thermal melting\ntemperature of 1680 K. Both excitation threshold and time evolution of\ndiffraction intensity agree well with experiment. Nonthermal melting is\nattributed to excitation-induced drastic changes in bonding electron density,\nand the subsequent decrease in the melting barrier, rather than lattice heating\nas previously assumed in the two-temperature models.\n", "  Our electroweak vacuum may be metastable in light of the current experimental\ndata of the Higgs/top quark mass. If this is really the case, high-scale\ninflation models require a stabilization mechanism of our vacuum during\ninflation. A possible candidate is the Higgs-inflaton/-curvature coupling\nbecause it induces an additional mass term to the Higgs during the slow roll\nregime. However, after the inflation, the additional mass term oscillates, and\nit can potentially destabilize our electroweak vacuum via production of large\nHiggs fluctuations during the inflaton oscillation era. In this paper, we study\nwhether or not the Higgs-inflaton/-curvature coupling can save our vacuum by\nproperly taking account of Higgs production during the preheating stage. We put\nupper bounds on the Higgs-inflaton/-curvature coupling, and discuss possible\ndynamics that might relax them.\n", "  We show that modifying a Bayesian data assimilation scheme by incorporating\nkinematically-consistent displacement corrections produces a scheme that is\ndemonstrably better at estimating partially observed state vectors in a setting\nwhere feature information important. While the displacement transformation is\nnot tied to any particular assimilation scheme, here we implement it within an\nensemble Kalman Filter and demonstrate its effectiveness in tracking\nstochastically perturbed vortices.\n", "  We have considered theoretically the feasibility of the broadband quantum\nmemory based on the resonant tripod-type atomic configuration. In this case,\nthe writing of a signal field is carried out simultaneously into two channels,\nand characterized by an excitation of two spin waves of the atomic ensemble.\nWith simultaneous read out from both channels quantum properties of the\noriginal signal are mapped on the retrieval pulse no worse than in the case of\nmemory based on Lambda-type atomic configuration. At the same time new\npossibilities are opened up for manipulation of quantum states associated with\nsequential reading out (and/or sequential writing) of signal pulses. For\nexample, the pulse in squeezed state is converted into two partially entangled\npulses with partially squeezed quadratures. Alternatively, two independent\nsignal pulses with orthogonal squeezed quadratures can be converted into two\nentangled pulses.\n", "  For over a century Minkowskian spacetime has dominated discussions of space\ncontraction and time dilation within special relativity. Brown and Pooley have\ncalled into question both the assumptions of Minkowski and the effects his\npresumed spacetime has upon objects in motion. But while they reject Minkowski,\nBrown and Pooley do not fill in the missing causal connection between velocity\nand space contraction and time dilation. To supply this causal connection\nbetween object and observer in relative motion we should be focusing on energy\ndifference rather than velocity difference. When different inertial observers\nat different relative velocities measure the same rod (or clock), each observer\nregisters a different amount of kinetic energy for the object. Following the\nconsequences of this permits a new understanding of relativistic space\ncontraction and time dilation.\n", "  A transient gravitational-wave signal, GW150914, was identified in the twin\nAdvanced LIGO detectors on September 14, 2015 at 09:50:45 UTC. To assess the\nimplications of this discovery, the detectors remained in operation with\nunchanged configurations over a period of 39 d around the time of the signal.\nAt the detection statistic threshold corresponding to that observed for\nGW150914, our search of the 16 days of simultaneous two-detector observational\ndata is estimated to have a false alarm rate (FAR) of $< 4.9 \\times 10^{-6} \\,\n\\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$, yielding a $p$-value for GW150914 of $< 2 \\times 10^{-7}$.\nParameter estimation followup on this trigger identifies its source as a binary\nblack hole (BBH) merger with component masses $(m_1, m_2) =\n\\left(36^{+5}_{-4},29^{+4}_{-4}\\right) \\, M_\\odot$ at redshift $z =\n0.09^{+0.03}_{-0.04}$ (median and 90\\% credible range). Here we report on the\nconstraints these observations place on the rate of BBH coalescences.\nConsidering only GW150914, assuming that all BBHs in the Universe have the same\nmasses and spins as this event, imposing a search FAR threshold of 1 per 100\nyears, and assuming that the BBH merger rate is constant in the comoving frame,\nwe infer a 90% credible range of merger rates between $2$--$53 \\,\n\\mathrm{Gpc}^{-3} \\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ (comoving frame). Incorporating all search\ntriggers that pass a much lower threshold while accounting for the uncertainty\nin the astrophysical origin of each trigger, we estimate a higher rate, ranging\nfrom $13$--$600 \\, \\mathrm{Gpc}^{-3} \\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ depending on assumptions\nabout the BBH mass distribution. All together, our various rate estimates fall\nin the conservative range $2$--$600 \\, \\mathrm{Gpc}^{-3} \\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$.\n", "  As a main structural level in colloidal food materials, extended colloidal\nnetworks are important for texture and rheology. By obtaining the 3D\nmicrostructure of the network, macroscopic mechanical properties of the\nmaterial can be inferred. However, this approach is hampered by the lack of\nsuitable non-destructive 3D imaging techniques with submicron resolution.\n  We present results of quantitative ptychographic X-ray computed tomography\napplied to a palm kernel oil based oil-in-water emulsion. The measurements were\ncarried out at ambient pressure and temperature. The 3D structure of the\nextended colloidal network of fat globules was obtained with a resolution of\naround 300 nm. Through image analysis of the network structure, the fat globule\nsize distribution was computed and compared to previous findings. In further\nsupport, the reconstructed electron density values were within 4% of reference\nvalues.\n", "  Resources are often limited, therefore it is essential how convincingly\ncompetitors present their claims for them. Beside a player's natural capacity,\nhere overconfidence and bluffing may also play a decisive role and influence\nhow to share a restricted reward. While bluff provides clear, but risky\nadvantage, overconfidence, as a form of self-deception, could be harmful to its\nuser. Still, it is a long-standing puzzle why these potentially damaging biases\nare maintained and evolving to a high level in the human society. Within the\nframework of evolutionary game theory, we present a simple version of resource\ncompetition game in which the coevolution of overconfidence and bluffing is\nfundamental, which is capable to explain their prevalence in structured\npopulations. Interestingly, bluffing seems apt to evolve to higher level than\ncorresponding overconfidence and in general the former is less resistant to\npunishment than the latter. Moreover, topological feature of the social network\nplays an intricate role in the spreading of overconfidence and bluffing. While\nthe heterogeneity of interactions facilitates bluffing, it also increases\nefficiency of adequate punishment against overconfident behavior. Furthermore,\nincreasing the degree of homogeneous networks can trigger similar effect. We\nalso observed that having high real capability may accommodate both bluffing\nability and overconfidence simultaneously.\n", "  We derive a concise and general expression of the energy dissipation rate for\ncoupled oscillators rotating on circular trajectories by unifying the\nnonequilibrium aspects with the nonlinear dynamics via stochastic\nthermodynamics. In the framework of phase oscillator models, it is known that\nthe even and odd parts of the coupling function express the effect on\ncollective and relative dynamics, respectively. We reveal that the odd part\nalways decreases the dissipation upon synchronization, while the even part\nyields a characteristic square-root change of the dissipation near the\nbifurcation point whose sign depends on the specific system parameters. We\napply our theory to hydrodynamically coupled Stokes spheres rotating on\ncircular trajectories that can be interpreted as a simple model of\nsynchronization of coupled oscillators in a biophysical system. We show that\nthe coupled Stokes spheres gain the ability to do more work on the surrounding\nfluid as the degree of phase synchronization increases.\n", "  We present an application, Superplot, for calculating and plotting\nstatistical quantities relevant to parameter inference from a \"chain\" of\nsamples drawn from a parameter space, produced by e.g. MultiNest. A simple\ngraphical interface allows one to browse a chain of many variables quickly, and\nmake publication quality plots of, inter alia, one- and two-dimensional profile\nlikelihood, posterior pdf (with kernel density estimation), confidence\nintervals and credible regions. In this short manual, we document installation\nand basic usage, and define all statistical quantities and conventions. The\ncode is fully compatible with Linux, Windows and Mac OSX. Furthermore, if\npreferred, all functionality is available through the command line rather than\na graphical interface.\n", "  Motivated by systems in which droplets grow and shrink in a turbulence-driven\nsupersaturation field, we investigate the problem of turbulent condensation in\na general manner. Using direct numerical simulations we show that the turbulent\nfluctuations of the supersaturation field offer different conditions for the\ngrowth of droplets which evolve in time due to turbulent transport and mixing.\nBased on that, we propose a Lagrangian stochastic model for condensation and\nevaporation of small droplets in turbulent flows. It consists of a set of\nstochastic integro-differential equations for the joint evolution of the\nsquared radius and the supersaturation along the droplet trajectories. The\nmodel has two parameters fixed by the total amount of water and the\nthermodynamic properties, as well as the Lagrangian integral timescale of the\nturbulent supersaturation. The model reproduces very well the droplet size\ndistributions obtained from direct numerical simulations and their time\nevolution. A noticeable result is that, after a stage where the squared radius\nsimply diffuses, the system converges exponentially fast to a statistical\nsteady state independent of the initial conditions. The main mechanism involved\nin this convergence is a loss of memory induced by a significant number of\ndroplets undergoing a complete evaporation before growing again. The\nstatistical steady state is characterised by an exponential tail in the droplet\nmass distribution. These results reconcile those of earlier numerical studies,\nonce these various regimes are considered.\n", "  We study the angular deflection of the circular polarized components of a\nlinearly polarized probe field in a weakly birefringent atomic system in tripod\nconfiguration. A spatially inhomogeneous control field incident obliquely onto\nan atomic vapor cell facilitates a large angular divergence between circular\ncomponents. We show that the angular resolution can be dynamically controlled\nby optimally choosing the angle of incidence and the transverse profile of the\ncontrol beam. For instance, by employing a Laguerre-Gaussian profile of the\ncontrol field, one can impart a large angular divergence to the circular\ncomponents close to the entry face of the atomic vapor cell. We further\ndemonstrate how such a medium causes the focusing and refocusing of the probe\nfield, thereby acting as a lens with multiple foci. The absorption in the\nmedium remains negligible at resonance due to electromagnetically induced\ntransparency (EIT).\n", "  We demonstrate that plastic deformation in solids is associated with a\ndynamic transition that is reminiscent to the transition from a superconducting\nto a mixed phase in Type II superconductors. We report analytic calculations,\nextensive molecular dynamics and sequential umbrella sampling Monte Carlo\nsimulations of a two dimensional triangular crystalline solid undergoing\nplastic deformation under strain. The solid consists of particles connected by\nharmonic springs. Non-affine displacement fluctuations of the solid are\nenhanced using an external field, causing a rich deformation behaviour. The\nexternal field leads to a mixed phase, where defect and stress-free\ncrystallites are surrounded by a network of amorphous regions with large local\ninternal stress --- a \"stress Meissner\" effect. The transition shows slow\nageing dynamics caused by the presence of many competing, non-crystalline\nfree-energy minima. Under uniform uniaxial strain, this amorphization\ntransition gives rise to irreversible plastic deformation with the amorphous\nregions appearing as band-like structures. Our results may be checked by\ncareful experiments on colloidal crystals using holographic optical tweezers.\n", "  This paper studies the competition of fracture initiation in the ductile soft\nphase and in the comparatively brittle hard phase in the microstructure of a\ntwo-phase material. A simple microstructural model is used to predict\nmacroscopic fracture initiation. The simplicity of the model ensures highly\nefficient computations, enabling an comprehensive study: a large range of hard\nphase volume fractions and yield stress ratios, for wide range of applied\nstress states. Each combination of these parameters is analyzed using a large\nset of (random) microstructures. It is observed that only one of the phases\ndominates macroscopic fracture initiation: at low stress triaxiality the soft\nphase is dominant, but above a critical triaxiality the hard phase takes over\nresulting in a strong decrease in ductility. This transition is strongly\ndependent on microstructural parameters. If the hard phase volume fraction is\nsmall, the fracture initiation is dominated by the soft phase even at high\nphase contrast. At higher hard phase volume fraction, the hard phase dominates\nalready at low phase contrast. This simple model thereby reconciles\nexperimental observations from the literature for a specific combination of\nparameters, which may have triggered contradictory statements in the past. A\nmicroscopic analysis reveals that the average phase distribution around\nfracture initiation sites is nearly the same for the two failure mechanisms.\nAlong the tensile direction, regions of the hard phase are found directly next\nto the fracture initiation site. This `band' of hard phase is intersected\nthrough the fracture initiation site by `bands' of the soft phase aligned with\nshear. Clearly, the local mechanical incompatibility is dominant for the\ninitiation of fracture, regardless whether fracture initiates in the soft or in\nthe hard phase.\n", "  This paper unravels micromechanical aspects of metallic materials whose\nmicrostructure comprises grains of two or more phases. The local plastic\nresponse is determined by (i) the relative misorientation of the slip systems\nof individual grains, and (ii) the different mechanical properties of the\nphases. The relative importance of these two mechanisms at the meso-scale is\nunclear: is the plastic response dominated by the grain's anisotropy, or is\nthis effect overwhelmed by the mechanical contrast between the two phases? The\nanswer impacts the modeling of such a material at the meso-scale, but also\ngives insights in the resulting fracture mechanisms at that length-scale. Until\nnow, this question has been addressed only for particular crystallographies and\nmechanical properties. In contrast, this paper studies the issue systematically\nusing a large set of phase distributions, crystallographies, and material\nparameters. It is found that the macroscopic and the mesoscopic\n(grain-averaged) plastic response of the two extreme modeling choices (crystal\nplasticity or isotropic plasticity) converge with increasing phase contrast.\nThe effect of the crystallography is completely overwhelmed by the phase\ncontrast when the yield stress of the hard phase is a factor of four higher\ncompared to the soft phase. When this ratio is lower than two, its influence\nmay not be neglected. However, even in this regime, fracture initiation is\ncontrolled by the local arrangement of the phases. The latter is quantified in\nthis paper through the average arrangement of the phases around fracture\ninitiation sites.\n", "  We describe recent experimental efforts to perform polarization-resolved\noptical spectroscopy of monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenide\nsemiconductors in very large pulsed magnetic fields to 65 tesla. The\nexperimental setup and technical challenges are discussed in detail, and\ntemperature-dependent magneto-reflection spectra from atomically thin tungsten\ndisulphide (WS$_2$) are presented. The data clearly reveal not only the valley\nZeeman effect in these 2D semiconductors, but also the small quadratic exciton\ndiamagnetic shift from which the very small exciton size can be directly\ninferred. Finally, we present model calculations that demonstrate how the\nmeasured diamagnetic shifts can be used to constrain estimates of the exciton\nbinding energy in this new family of monolayer semiconductors.\n", "  Despite the tremendous progresses in wavefront control through or inside\ncomplex scattering media, several limitations prevent reaching practical\nfeasibility for nonlinear imaging in biological tissues. While the optimization\nof nonlinear signals might suffer from low signal to noise conditions and from\npossible artifacts at large penetration depths, it has nevertheless been\nlargely used in the multiple scattering regime since it provides a guide star\nmechanism as well as an intrinsic compensation for spatiotemporal distortions.\nHere, we demonstrate the benefit of Transmission Matrix (TM) based approaches\nunder broadband illumination conditions, to perform nonlinear imaging. Using\nultrashort pulse illumination with spectral bandwidth comparable but still\nlower than the spectral width of the scattering medium, we show strong\nnonlinear enhancements of several orders of magnitude, through thicknesses of a\nfew transport mean free paths, which corresponds to millimeters in biological\ntissues. Linear TM refocusing is moreover compatible with fast scanning\nnonlinear imaging and potentially with acoustic based methods, which paves the\nway for nonlinear microscopy deep inside scattering media.\n", "  Understanding the microstructural influence on the failure mechanisms in\nmulti-phase materials calls for the identification of the worst-case scenario.\nThis necessitates a statistical approach. By performing simulations directly\nbased on micrographs, such an approach becomes feasible. This is applied here\nto extract the average microstructure around damage sites.\n", "  Axions can be described by a relativistic field theory with a real scalar\nfield $\\phi$ whose self-interaction potential is a periodic function of $\\phi$.\nLow-energy axions, such as those produced in the early universe by the vacuum\nmisalignment mechanism, can be described more simply by a nonrelativistic\neffective field theory with a complex scalar field $\\psi$ whose effective\npotential is a function of $\\psi^*\\psi$. We determine the coefficients in the\nexpansion of the effective potential to fifth order in $\\psi^*\\psi$ by matching\nlow-energy axion scattering amplitudes. In order to describe a Bose-Einstein\ncondensate of axions that is too dense to expand the effective potential in\npowers of $\\psi^*\\psi$, we develop a sequence of systematically improvable\napproximations to the effective potential that include terms of all orders in\n$\\psi^*\\psi$.\n", "  Transport properties of the complex oxide LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interface are\ninvestigated under high magnetic field (55T). By rotating the sample with\nrespect to the magnetic field, the two-dimensional nature of charge transport\nis clearly established. Small oscillations of the agnetoresistance with altered\nperiodicity are observed when plotted versus inverse magnetic field. We\nattribute this effect to Rashba spin-orbit coupling which remains consistent\nwith large negative magnetoresistance when the field is parallel to the sample\nplane. A large inconsistency between the carrier density extracted from\nShubnikov-de Haas analysis and from the Hall effect is explained by the\ncontribution to transport of at least two bands with different mobility.\n", "  We investigate the transport properties of Chern insulators following a\nquantum quench between topological and non-topological phases. Recent works\nhave shown that this yields an excited state for which the Chern number is\npreserved under unitary evolution. However, this does not imply the\npreservation of other physical observables, as we stressed in our previous\nwork. Here we provide an analysis of the Hall response following a quantum\nquench in an isolated system, with explicit results for the Haldane model. We\nshow that the Hall conductance is no longer related to the Chern number in the\npost-quench state, in agreement with previous work. We also examine the\ndynamics of the edge currents in finite-size systems with open boundary\nconditions along one direction. We show that the late-time behavior is captured\nby a Generalized Gibbs Ensemble, after multiple traversals of the sample. We\ndiscuss the effects of generic open boundary conditions and confinement\npotentials.\n", "  We present new ways to identify single and multiple moons around extrasolar\nplanets using planetary transit timing variations (TTVs) and transit duration\nvariations (TDVs). For planets with one moon, measurements from successive\ntransits exhibit a hitherto undescribed pattern in the TTV-TDV diagram,\noriginating from the stroboscopic sampling of the planet's orbit around the\nplanet-moon barycenter. This pattern is fully determined and analytically\npredictable after three consecutive transits. The more measurements become\navailable, the more the TTV-TDV diagram approaches an ellipse. For planets with\nmultiple moons in orbital mean motion resonance (MMR), like the Galilean moons,\nthe pattern is much more complex and addressed numerically in this report.\nExomoons in MMR can also form closed, predictable TTV-TDV figures if the drift\nof the moons' pericenters is sufficiently slow. We find that MMR exomoons\nproduce loops in the TTV-TDV diagram and that the number of these loops is\nequal to the order of the MMR, or the largest integer in the MMR ratio. We use\na Bayesian model and Monte Carlo simulations to test the discoverability of\nexomoons using TTV-TDV diagrams with current and near-future technology. In a\nblind test, two of us (BP, DA) successfully retrieved a large moon from\nsimulated TTV-TDV by co-authors MH and RH, which resembled data from a known\nKepler planet candidate. Single exomoons with a 10% moon-to-planet mass ratio,\nlike to Pluto-Charon binary, can be detectable in the archival data of the\nKepler primary mission. Multi-exomoon systems, however, require either larger\ntelescopes or brighter target stars. Complementary detection methods invoking a\nmoon's own photometric transit or its orbital sampling effect can be used for\nvalidation or falsification. A combination of TESS, CHEOPS, and PLATO data\nwould offer a compelling opportunity for exomoon discoveries around bright\nstars.\n", "  During a quarter of a century, the main characteristics of the\nhorizontal-to-vertical spectral ratio of ambient noise HVSRN have been\nextensively used for site effect assessment. In spite of the uncertainties\nabout the optimum theoretical model to describe these observations, several\nschemes for inversion of the full HVSRN curve for near surface surveying have\nbeen developed over the last decade.\n  In this work, a computer code for forward calculation of H/V spectra based on\nthe diffuse field assumption (DFA) is presented and tested.It takes advantage\nof the recently stated connection between the HVSRN and the elastodynamic\nGreen's function which arises from the ambient noise interferometry theory.\n  The algorithm allows for (1) a natural calculation of the Green's functions\nimaginary parts by using suitable contour integrals in the complex wavenumber\nplane, and (2) separate calculation of the contributions of Rayleigh, Love,\nP-SV and SH waves as well. The stability of the algorithm at high frequencies\nis preserved by means of an adaptation of the Wang's orthonormalization method\nto the calculation of dispersion curves, surface-waves medium responses and\ncontributions of body waves.\n  This code has been combined with a variety of inversion methods to make up a\npowerful tool for passive seismic surveying.\n", "  We critically evaluate the most widespread assumption in the theoretical\ndescription of coherent control strategies for open quantum systems. We show\nthat, for non-Markovian open systems dynamics, this fixed-dissipator assumption\nleads to a serious pitfall causing insurmountable difficulties in the effective\nmodelling of the controlled system. We show that the only way to avoid these\nproblems is a full microscopic description of the controlled system in presence\nof noise. We illustrate our findings with a paradigmatic example.\n", "  We construct a new model of two-dimensional quantum spin systems that\ncombines intrinsic topo- logical orders and a global symmetry called flavour\nsymmetry. It is referred as the bilayer Doubled Semion model (bDS) and is an\ninstance of symmetry-enriched topological order. A honeycomb bi- layer lattice\nis introduced to combine a Double Semion Topolgical Order with a global\nspin-flavour symmetry to get the fractionalization of its quasiparticles. The\nbDS model exhibits non-trival braid- ing self-statistics of excitations and its\ndual model constitutes a Symmetry-Protected Topological Order with novel edge\nstates. This dual model gives rise to a bilayer Non-Trivial Paramagnet that is\ninvariant under the flavour symmetry and the well-known spin flip symmetry.\n", "  A theoretical analysis of the thermodynamic properties of the Robin wall\ncharacterized by the extrapolation length $\\Lambda$ in the electric field\n$\\mathscr{E}$ that pushes the particle to the surface is presented both in the\ncanonical and two grand canonical representations and in the whole range of the\nRobin distance with the emphasis on its negative values which for the\nvoltage-free configuration support negative-energy bound state. For the\ncanonical ensemble, the heat capacity at $\\Lambda<0$ exhibits a nonmonotonic\nbehavior as a function of the temperature $T$ with its pronounced maximum\nunrestrictedly increasing for the decreasing fields as $\\ln^2\\mathscr{E}$ and\nits location being proportional to $(-\\ln\\mathscr{E})^{-1}$. For the\nFermi-Dirac distribution, the specific heat per particle $c_N$ is a\nnonmonotonic function of the temperature too with the conspicuous extremum\nbeing preceded on the $T$ axis by the plateau whose magnitude at the vanishing\n$\\mathscr{E}$ is defined as $3(N-1)/(2N)k_B$, with $N$ being a number of the\nparticles. The maximum of $c_N$ is the largest for $N=1$ and, similar to the\ncanonical ensemble, grows to infinity as the field goes to zero. For the\nBose-Einstein ensemble, a formation of the sharp asymmetric feature on the\n$c_N$-$T$ dependence with the increase of $N$ is shown to be more prominent at\nthe lower voltages. This cusp-like dependence of the heat capacity on the\ntemperature, which for the infinite number of bosons transforms into the\ndiscontinuity of $c_N(T)$, is an indication of the phase transition to the\ncondensate state. Qualitative and quantitative explanation of these physical\nphenomena is based on the variation of the energy spectrum by the electric\nfield.\n", "  The topology of pure Bi is controversial because of its very small ($\\sim$10\nmeV) band gap. Here we perform high-resolution angle-resolved photoelectron\nspectroscopy measurements systematically on 14$-$202 bilayers Bi films. Using\nhigh-quality films, we succeed in observing quantized bulk bands with energy\nseparations down to $\\sim$10 meV. Detailed analyses on the phase shift of the\nconfined wave functions precisely determine the surface and bulk electronic\nstructures, which unambiguously show nontrivial topology. The present results\nnot only prove the fundamental property of Bi but also introduce a capability\nof the quantum-confinement approach.\n", "  Van Hove singularities (VHS's) in the density of states play an outstanding\nand diverse role for the electronic and thermodynamic properties of crystalline\nsolids. At the critical point the Fermi surface connectivity changes and\ntopological properties undergo a transition. Opportunities to systematically\npass a VHS at the turn of a voltage knob and study its diverse impact are\nhowever rare. With the advent of van der Waals heterostructures, control over\nthe atomic registry of neigbouring graphene layers offers an unprecedented tool\nto generate a low energy VHS easily accessible with conventional gating. Here\nwe have addressed magnetotransport when the chemical potential crosses the\ntwist angle induced VHS in twisted bilayer graphene. A topological phase\ntransition is experimentally disclosed in the abrupt conversion of electrons to\nholes or vice versa, a loss of a non-zero Berry phase and distinct sequences of\ninteger quantum Hall states above and below the singularity.\n", "  The Geroch-Held-Penrose formalism is used to re-analyse algebraically special\nnon-null Einstein-Maxwell fields, aligned as well as non-aligned, in the\npresence of a possible non-vanishing cosmological constant. A new invariant\ncharacterisation is given of the Garcia-Plebanski and Plebanski-Hacyan metrics\nwithin the family of aligned solutions and of the Griffiths metrics within the\nfamily of the non-aligned solutions. As a corollary also the double alignment\nof the Debever-McLenaghan 'class D' metrics with non-vanishing cosmological\nconstant is shown to be equivalent with the shear-free and geodesic behaviour\nof their Debever-Penrose vectors.\n", "  We study lattice superconductors such as attractive Hubbard models. As is\nwell known, Bloch's theorem asserts absence of persistent current in ground\nstates and equilibrium states for general fermion systems. While the statement\nof the theorem is true, we can show that the theorem cannot exclude possibility\nof a surface persistent current. Such a current can be stabilized by boundary\nmagnetic fields which do not penetrate into the bulk region of a\nsuperconductor, provided emergence of massive photons, i.e., Meissner effect.\nTherefore, we can expect that a surface persistent current is realized for a\nground/equilibrium state in the sense of stability against local perturbations.\nWe also apply Elitzur's theorem to superconductors at finite temperatures. As a\nresult, we prove absence of symmetry breaking of the global $U(1)$ phase of\nelectrons for almost all gauge fields. These observations suggest that the\nnature of superconductivity is the emergence of massive photons rather than the\nsymmetry breaking of the $U(1)$ phase of electrons.\n", "  We study the confinement/deconfinement transition in a strongly coupled\nsystem triggered by an independent symmetry-breaking quantum phase transition\nin gauge/gravity duality. The gravity dual is an Einstein-scalar-dilaton system\nwith AdS near-boundary behavior and soft wall interior at zero scalar\ncondensate. We study the cases of neutral and charged condensate separately. In\nthe former case the condensation breaks the discrete $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry\nwhile a charged condensate breaks the continuous $U(1)$ symmetry. After the\ncondensation of the order parameter, the non-zero vacuum expectation value of\nthe scalar couples to the dilaton, changing the soft wall geometry into a\nnon-confining and anisotropically scale-invariant infrared metric. In other\nwords, the formation of long-range order is immediately followed by the\ndeconfinement transition and the two critical points coincide. The confined\nphase has a scale -- the confinement scale (energy gap) which vanishes in the\ndeconfined case. Therefore, the breaking of the symmetry of the scalar\n($\\mathbb{Z}_2$ or $U(1)$) in turn restores the scaling symmetry in the system\nand neither phase has a higher overall symmetry than the other. When the scalar\nis charged the phase transition is continuous which goes against the\nGinzburg-Landau theory where such transitions generically only occur\ndiscontinuously. This phenomenon has some commonalities with the scenario of\ndeconfined criticality. The mechanism we have found has applications mainly in\neffective field theories such as quantum magnetic systems. We briefly discuss\nthese applications and the relation to real-world systems.\n", "  We consider the following frustrated optimization problem: given a prior\nprobability distribution $q$, find the distribution $p$ minimizing the relative\nentropy with respect to $q$ such that $\\textrm{mean}(p)$ is fixed and large. We\nshow that solutions to this problem are asymptotically Gaussian. As an\napplication we derive an $H$-type theorem for evolutionary dynamics: the\nentropy of the (standardized) distribution of fitness of a population evolving\nunder natural selection is eventually increasing.\n", "  We present an all-dielectric photonic crystal structure that supports\ntwo-dimensionally confined helical topological edge states. The topological\nproperties of the system are controlled by the crystal parameters. An interface\nbetween two regions of differing band topologies gives rise to topological edge\nstates confined in a dielectric slab that propagate around sharp corners\nwithout backscattering. Three dimensional finite-difference time-domain\ncalculations show these edges to be confined in the out-of-plane direction by\ntotal internal reflection. Such nanoscale photonic crystal architectures could\nenable strong interactions between photonic edge states and quantum emitters.\n", "  We study the composition question for bounded-error randomized query\ncomplexity: Is R(f o g) = Omega(R(f) R(g)) for all Boolean functions f and g?\nWe show that inserting a simple Boolean function h, whose query complexity is\nonly Theta(log R(g)), in between f and g allows us to prove R(f o h o g) =\nOmega(R(f) R(h) R(g)).\n  We prove this using a new lower bound measure for randomized query complexity\nwe call randomized sabotage complexity, RS(f). Randomized sabotage complexity\nhas several desirable properties, such as a perfect composition theorem, RS(f o\ng) >= RS(f) RS(g), and a composition theorem with randomized query complexity,\nR(f o g) = Omega(R(f) RS(g)). It is also a quadratically tight lower bound for\ntotal functions and can be quadratically superior to the partition bound, the\nbest known general lower bound for randomized query complexity.\n  Using this technique we also show implications for lifting theorems in\ncommunication complexity. We show that a general lifting theorem for zero-error\nrandomized protocols implies a general lifting theorem for bounded-error\nprotocols.\n", "  We demonstrate the applicability of a recently proposed multiscale\nthermalization algorithm to two-color quantum chromodynamics (QCD) with two\nmass-degenerate fermion flavors. The algorithm involves refining an ensemble of\ngauge configurations that had been generated using a renormalization group (RG)\nmatched coarse action, thereby producing a fine ensemble that is close to the\nthermalized distribution of a target fine action; the refined ensemble is\nsubsequently rethermalized using conventional algorithms. Although the\ngeneralization of this algorithm from pure Yang-Mills theory to QCD with\ndynamical fermions is straightforward, we find that in the latter case, the\nmethod is susceptible to numerical instabilities during the initial stages of\nrethermalization when using the hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm. We find that\nthese instabilities arise from large fermion forces in the evolution, which are\nattributed to an accumulation of spurious near-zero modes of the Dirac\noperator. We propose a simple strategy for curing this problem, and demonstrate\nthat rapid thermalization--as probed by a variety of gluonic and fermionic\noperators--is possible with the use of this solution. In addition, we study the\nsensitivity of rethermalization rates to the RG matching of the coarse and fine\nactions, and identify effective matching conditions based on a variety of\nmeasured scales.\n", "  Spatial modes of light can potentially carry a vast amount of information,\nmaking them promising candidates for both classical and quantum communication.\nHowever, the distribution of such modes over large distances remains difficult.\nIntermodal coupling complicates their use with common fibers, while free-space\ntransmission is thought to be strongly influenced by atmospheric turbulence.\nHere we show the transmission of orbital angular momentum modes of light over a\ndistance of 143 kilometers between two Canary Islands, which is 50 times\ngreater than the maximum distance achieved previously. As a demonstration of\nthe transmission quality, we use superpositions of these modes to encode a\nshort message. At the receiver, an artificial neural network is used for\ndistinguishing between the different twisted light superpositions. The\nalgorithm is able to identify different mode superpositions with an accuracy of\nmore than 80% up to the third mode order, and decode the transmitted message\nwith an error rate of 8.33%. Using our data, we estimate that the distribution\nof orbital angular momentum entanglement over more than 100 kilometers of free\nspace is feasible. Moreover, the quality of our free-space link can be further\nimproved by the use of state-of-the-art adaptive optics systems.\n", "  The three loop ladder diagram is a graph with six links and four cubic\nvertices that contributes to the D^{12} R^4 amplitude at genus one in type II\nstring theory. The vertices represent the insertion points of vertex operators\non the toroidal worldsheet and the links represent scalar Green functions\nconnecting them. By using the properties of the Green function and manipulating\nthe various expressions, we obtain a modular invariant Poisson equation\nsatisfied by this diagram, with source terms involving one, two and three loop\ndiagrams. Unlike the source terms in the Poisson equations for diagrams at\nlower orders in the momentum expansion or the Mercedes diagram, a particular\nsource term involves a five point function containing a holomorphic and a\nantiholomorphic worldsheet derivative acting on different Green functions. We\nalso obtain simple equalities between topologically distinct diagrams, and\nconsider some elementary examples.\n", "  The effect of viscosity and thermal conduction on the acoustics in a shear\nlayer above an impedance wall is investigated numerically and asymptotically by\nsolving the compressible linearised Navier-Stokes equations. It is found that\nviscothermal effects can be as important as shear, and therefore including\nshear while neglecting viscothermal effects by solving the linearised Euler\nequations is questionable. In particular, the damping rate of upstream\npropagating waves is found to be dramatically under-predicted by the LEE in\ncertain instances. The effects of viscosity on stability are also found to be\nimportant. Short wavelength disturbances are stabilised by viscosity, greatly\naltering the characteristic wavelength and maximum growth rate of instability.\nFor the parameters typical of aeroacoustic simulations considered here, the\nReynolds number below which the flow stabilizes ranges from $10^5$ to $10^7$.\nBy assuming a thin but nonzero-thickness boundary layer, asymptotic analysis\nleads to a system of boundary layer governing equations for the acoustics. This\nsystem may be solved numerically to produce an effective impedance boundary\ncondition, applicable at the wall of a uniform inviscid flow, that accounts for\nboth the shear and viscosity within the boundary layer. An alternative\nasymptotic analysis in the high frequency limit yields a different set of\nequations with analytic solutions. The acoustic mode shapes and axial\nwavenumbers from both asymptotic analyses compare well with numerical solutions\nof the full LNSE. A closed-form effective impedance boundary condition is\nderived from the high-frequency asymptotics, suitable for application in\nfrequency-domain numerical simulations. Finally, surface waves are considered,\nand it is shown that a viscous flow over an impedance lining supports a greater\nnumber of surface wave modes than an inviscid flow.\n", "  Despite its relevance in biology and engineering, the molecular mechanism\ndriving cavitation in water remains unknown. Using computer simulations, we\ninvestigate the structure and dynamics of vapor bubbles emerging from\nmetastable water at negative pressures. We find that in the early stages of\ncavitation, bubbles are irregularly shaped and become more spherical as they\ngrow. Nevertheless, the free energy of bubble formation can be perfectly\nreproduced in the framework of classical nucleation theory (CNT) if the\ncurvature dependence of the surface tension is taken into account. Comparison\nof the observed bubble dynamics to the predictions of the macroscopic\nRayleigh--Plesset (RP) equation, augmented with thermal fluctuations,\ndemonstrates that the growth of nanoscale bubbles is governed by viscous\nforces. Combining the dynamical prefactor determined from the RP equation with\nthe free energy of CNT yields an analytical expression for the cavitation rate\nthat reproduces the simulation results very well over a wide range of\npressures. Furthermore, our theoretical predictions are in excellent agreement\nwith cavitation rates obtained from inclusion experiments. This suggests that\nhomogeneous nucleation is observed in inclusions, whereas only heterogeneous\nnucleation on impurities or defects occurs in other experiments.\n", "  Recent theoretical and experimental work has suggested the tantalizing\npossibility of opening a topological gap upon driving the surface states of a\nthree-dimensional strong topological insulator (TI) with circularly polarized\nlight. With this motivation, we study the response of TIs to a driving field\nthat couples to states near the surface. We unexpectedly find coherent\noscillations between the surface and the bulk and trace their appearance to\nunavoidable resonances caused by photon absorption from the drive. We show how\nthese resonant oscillations may be captured by the Demkov- Osherov model of\nmulti-level Landau-Zener physics, leading to non-trivial consequences such as\nthe loss of adiabaticity upon slow ramping of the amplitude. We numerically\ndemonstrate that these oscillations are observable in the time-dependent Wigner\ndistribution, which is directly measurable in time-resolved ARPES experiments.\nOur results apply generically to any system with surface states in the presence\nof a gapped bulk, and thus suggest experimental signatures of a novel\nsurface-bulk coupling mechanism that is fundamental for proposals to engineer\nnon-trivial states by periodic driving.\n", "  Supplemental information for a Letter reporting the rate of binary black hole\n(BBH) coalescences inferred from 16 days of coincident Advanced LIGO\nobservations surrounding the transient gravitational wave signal GW150914. In\nthat work we reported various rate estimates whose 90\\% credible intervals fell\nin the range $2$--$600 \\, \\mathrm{Gpc}^{-3} \\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$. Here we give\ndetails of our method and computations, including information about our search\npipelines, a derivation of our likelihood function for the analysis, a\ndescription of the astrophysical search trigger distribution expected from\nmerging BBHs, details on our computational methods, a description of the\neffects and our model for calibration uncertainty, and an analytic method of\nestimating our detector sensitivity that is calibrated to our measurements.\n", "  We consider modular graph functions that arise in the low energy expansion of\nthe four graviton amplitude in type II string theory. The vertices of these\ngraphs are the positions of insertions of vertex operators on the toroidal\nworldsheet, while the links are the scalar Green functions connecting the\nvertices. Graphs with four and five links satisfy several non--trivial\nrelations, which have been proved recently. We prove these relations by using\nelementary properties of Green functions and the details of the graphs. We also\nprove a relation between modular graph functions with six links.\n", "  Predicting risk profiles of individuals in networks (e.g.~susceptibility to a\nparticular disease, or likelihood of smoking) is challenging for a variety of\nreasons. For one, `local' features (such as an individual's demographic\ninformation) may lack sufficient information to make informative predictions;\nthis is especially problematic when predicting `risk,' as the relevant features\nmay be precisely those that an individual is disinclined to reveal in a survey.\nSecondly, even if such features are available, they still may miss crucial\ninformation, as `risk' may be a function not just of an individual's features\nbut also those of their friends and social communities. Here, we predict\nindividual's risk profiles as a function of both their local features and those\nof their friends. Instead of modeling influence from the social network\ndirectly (which proved difficult as friendship links may be sparse and\npartially observed), we instead model influence by discovering social\ncommunities in the network that may be related to risky behavior. The result is\na model that predicts risk as a function of local features, while making up for\ntheir deficiencies and accounting for social influence by uncovering community\nstructure in the network. We test our model by predicting risky behavior among\nadolescents from the Add health data set, and hometowns among users in a\nFacebook ego net. Compared to prediction by features alone, our model\ndemonstrates better predictive accuracy when measured as a whole, and in\nparticular when measured as a function of network \"richness.\"\n", "  Motivated by recent progress in studies of the high-$z$ Universe, we build a\nnew model for the global 21-cm signal that is explicitly calibrated to\nmeasurements of the galaxy luminosity function (LF) and further tuned to match\nthe Thomson scattering optical depth of the cosmic microwave background,\n$\\tau_e$. Assuming that the $z \\lesssim 8$ galaxy population can be smoothly\nextrapolated to higher redshifts, the recent decline in best-fit values of\n$\\tau_e$ and the inefficient heating induced by X-ray binaries (HMXBs; the\npresumptive sources of the X-ray background at high-$z$) imply that the\nentirety of cosmic reionization and reheating occurs at redshifts $z \\lesssim\n12$. In contrast to past global 21-cm models, whose $z \\sim 20$ ($\\nu \\sim 70$\nMHz) absorption features and strong $\\sim 25$ mK emission features were driven\nlargely by the assumption of efficient early star-formation and X-ray heating,\nour new fiducial model peaks in absorption at $\\nu \\sim 110$ MHz at a depth of\n$\\sim -160$ mK and has a negligible emission component. As a result, a strong\nemission signal would provide convincing evidence that HMXBs are not the only\ndrivers of cosmic reheating. Shallow absorption troughs should accompany strong\nheating scenarios, but could also be caused by a low escape fraction of\nLyman-Werner photons. Generating signals with troughs at $\\nu \\lesssim 95$ MHz\nrequires a floor in the star-formation efficiency in halos below $\\sim 10^{9}\nM_{\\odot}$, which is equivalent to steepening the faint-end of the galaxy LF.\nThese findings demonstrate that the global 21-cm signal is a powerful\ncomplement to current and future galaxy surveys and efforts to better\nunderstand the interstellar medium in high-$z$ galaxies.\n", "  Inversion enables the construction of interaction potentials underlying -\nunder fortunate circumstances even analytic - instantaneous Bethe-Salpeter\ndescriptions of all lightest pseudoscalar mesons as quark-antiquark bound\nstates of Goldstone-boson nature.\n", "  Revisiting the strong couplings of three mesons, each of which involves at\nleast one charm quark, proves clear disaccord between quark-model and QCD\nsum-rule results.\n", "  The existence of interactions between dark matter and dark energy has been\nwidely studied, since they can fit well the observational data and may provide\nnew physics through such an interaction. In this work we analyze these models\nand investigate their potential relation with future cosmological\nsingularities. We find that every future singularity found in the literature\ncan be mapped into a singularity of the interaction term, that we call\n$Q$-singularity, where the energy flow between the dark components diverges.\nFurthermore, this framework allows to identify a new type of future singularity\ninduced by the divergence of the first derivative of the dark energy equation\nof state parameter.\n", "  Photonic nonreciprocal components, such as isolators and circulators, provide\nhighly desirable functionalities for optical circuitry. This motivates the\nactive investigation of mechanisms that break reciprocity, and pose\nalternatives to magneto-optic effects in on-chip systems. In this work, we use\noptomechanical interactions to strongly break reciprocity in a compact system.\nWe derive minimal requirements to create nonreciprocity in a wide class of\nsystems that couple two optical modes to a mechanical mode, highlighting the\nimportance of optically biasing the modes at a controlled phase difference. We\nrealize these principles in a silica microtoroid optomechanical resonator and\nuse quantitative heterodyne spectroscopy to demonstrate up to 10 dB optical\nisolation at telecom wavelengths. We show that nonreciprocal transmission is\npreserved for nondegenerate modes, and demonstrate nonreciprocal parametric\namplification. These results open a route to exploiting various nonreciprocal\neffects in optomechanical systems in different electromagnetic and mechanical\nfrequency regimes, including optomechanical metamaterials with topologically\nnon-trivial properties.\n", "  We present a systematic, quantitative assessment of the impact of pore size\ndisorder and its interplay with flow rates and wettability on immiscible\ndisplacement of a viscous fluid. Pore-scale simulations and micromodel\nexperiments show that reducing disorder increases the displacement efficiency\nand compactness, minimizing the fluid-fluid interfacial area, through (i)\ntrapping at low rates and (ii) viscous fingering at high rates. Increasing the\nwetting angle suppresses both trapping and fingering, hence reducing the\nsensitivity of the displacement to the underlying disorder. A modified\ncapillary number $\\mathrm{Ca^*}$ that includes the impact of disorder $\\lambda$\non viscous forces (through pore connectivity) is direct related to $\\lambda$,\nin par with previous works. Our findings bear important consequences on sweep\nefficiency and fluid mixing and reactions, which are key in applications such\nas microfluidics to carbon geosequestration, energy recovery, and soil aeration\nand remediation.\n", "  We investigate the quantum phases of the frustrated spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$\n$J_1$-$J_2$-$J_3$ Heisenberg model on the square lattice with ferromagnetic\n$J_1$ and antiferromagnetic $J_2$ and $J_3$ interactions. Using the\npseudo-fermion functional renormalization group technique, we find an\nintermediate paramagnetic phase located between classically ordered\nferromagnetic, stripy antiferromagnetic, and incommensurate spiral phases. We\nobserve that quantum fluctuations lead to significant shifts of the spiral\npitch angles compared to the classical limit. By computing the response of the\nsystem with respect to various spin rotation and lattice symmetry-breaking\nperturbations, we identify a complex interplay between different nematic spin\nstates in the paramagnetic phase. While retaining time-reversal invariance,\nthese phases either break spin-rotation symmetry, lattice-rotation symmetry, or\na combination of both. We therefore propose the $J_1$-$J_2$-$J_3$ Heisenberg\nmodel on the square lattice as a paradigmatic example where different\nintimately connected types of nematic orders emerge in the same model.\n", "  Stars ejected from the Galactic centre can be used to place important\nconstraints on the Milky Way potential. Since existing hypervelocity stars are\ntoo distant to accurately determine orbits, we have conducted a search for\nnearby candidates using full three-dimensional velocities. Since the efficacy\nof such studies are often hampered by deficiencies in proper motion catalogs,\nwe have chosen to utilize the reliable, high-precision SDSS Stripe 82 proper\nmotion catalog. Although we do not find any candidates which have velocities in\nexcess of the escape speed, we identify 226 stars on orbits that are consistent\nwith Galactic centre ejection. This number is significantly larger than what we\nwould expect for halo stars on radial orbits and cannot be explained by disk or\nbulge contamination. If we restrict ourselves to metal-rich stars, we find 29\ncandidates with [Fe/H] > -0.8 dex and 10 with [Fe/H] > -0.6 dex. Their\nmetallicities are more consistent with what we expect for bulge ejecta, and so\nwe believe these candidates are especially deserving of further study. We have\nsupplemented this sample using our own radial velocities, developing an\nalgorithm to use proper motions for optimizing candidate selection. This\ntechnique provides considerable improvement on the blind spectroscopic sample\nof SDSS, being able to identify candidates with an efficiency around 20 times\nbetter than a blind search.\n", "  Exerting well-defined control over the reflection $(R)$, absorption $(A)$,\nand transmission $(T)$ of electromagnetic waves is a key objective in quantum\noptics. To this end, one often utilizes hybrid structures comprised of elements\nwith different optical properties in order to achieve features such as high $R$\nor high $A$ for incident light. A desirable goal would be the possibility to\ntune between all three regimes of nearly perfect reflection, absorption, and\ntransmission within the same device, thus swapping between the cases $R\\to 1$,\n$A\\to1$, and $T\\to1$ dynamically. We here show that a dielectric interfaced\nwith a graphene layer on each side allows for precisely this: by tuning only\nthe Fermi level of graphene, all three regimes can be reached in the THz regime\nand below. Moreover, we show that the inclusion of cylindrical defects in the\nsystem offers a different type of control of the scattering of electromagnetic\nwaves by means of the graphene layers.\n", "  Excitons in atomically-thin semiconductors necessarily lie close to a\nsurface, and therefore their properties are expected to be strongly influenced\nby the surrounding dielectric environment. However, systematic studies\nexploring this role are challenging, in part because the most readily\naccessible exciton parameter -- the exciton's optical transition energy -- is\nlargely \\textit{un}affected by the surrounding medium. Here we show that the\nrole of the dielectric environment is revealed through its systematic influence\non the \\textit{size} of the exciton, which can be directly measured via the\ndiamagnetic shift of the exciton transition in high magnetic fields. Using\nexfoliated WSe$_2$ monolayers affixed to single-mode optical fibers, we tune\nthe surrounding dielectric environment by encapsulating the flakes with\ndifferent materials, and perform polarized low-temperature magneto-absorption\nstudies to 65~T. The systematic increase of the exciton's size with dielectric\nscreening, and concurrent reduction in binding energy (also inferred from these\nmeasurements), is quantitatively compared with leading theoretical models.\nThese results demonstrate how exciton properties can be tuned in future 2D\noptoelectronic devices.\n", "  We discuss the specific features of extracting properties of the exotic\npolyquark hadrons (tetraquarks, pentaquarks) compared to the usual hadrons by\nthe QCD sum-rule approach. In the case of the ordinary hadrons, already the\none-loop leading-order correlation functions provide the bulk of the hadron\nobservables, e.g., of the form factor; inclusion of radiative corrections\nmodifies already nonzero one-loop contributions. In the case of an exotic\nhadron, the situation is qualitatively different: discussing strong decays of\nan exotic tetraquark meson, which provide the main contribution to its width,\nwe show that the disconnected leading-order diagrams are not related to the\ntetraquark properties. For a proper description of the tetraquark decay width,\nit is mandatory to calculate specific radiative corrections which generate the\nconnected diagrams.\n", "  Vacuum perturbations of the Kerr metric can be reconstructed from the\ncorresponding perturbation in either of the two Weyl scalars $\\psi_0$ or\n$\\psi_4$, using a procedure described by Chrzanowski and others in the 1970s.\nMore recent work, motivated within the context of self-force physics, extends\nthe procedure to metric perturbations sourced by a particle in a bound geodesic\norbit. However, the existing procedure leaves undetermined a certain\nstationary, axially-symmetric piece of the metric perturbation. In the vacuum\nregion away from the particle, this \"completion\" piece corresponds simply to\nmass and angular-momentum perturbations of the Kerr background, with amplitudes\nthat are, however, a priori unknown. Here we present and implement a rigorous\nmethod for finding the completion piece. The key idea is to impose continuity,\noff the particle, of certain gauge-invariant fields constructed from the full\n(completed) perturbation, in order to determine the unknown amplitude\nparameters of the completion piece. We implement this method in full for bound\n(eccentric) geodesic orbits in the equatorial plane of the Kerr black hole. Our\nresults provide a rigorous underpinning of recent results by Friedman {\\it et\nal.}\\ for circular orbits, and extend them to non-circular orbits.\n", "  Exascale computing will feature novel and potentially disruptive hardware\narchitectures. Exploiting these to their full potential is non-trivial.\nNumerical modelling frameworks involving finite difference methods are\ncurrently limited by the 'static' nature of the hand-coded discretisation\nschemes and repeatedly may have to be re-written to run efficiently on new\nhardware. In contrast, OpenSBLI uses code generation to derive the model's code\nfrom a high-level specification. Users focus on the equations to solve, whilst\nnot concerning themselves with the detailed implementation. Source-to-source\ntranslation is used to tailor the code and enable its execution on a variety of\nhardware.\n", "  We present a scaling description of a metal-insulator transition in\ntwo-dimensional electron systems that is driven by a vanishing compressibility\nrather than a vanishing diffusion coefficient. A small set of basic assumptions\nleads to a consistent theoretical framework that is compatible with existing\ntransport and compressibility measurements, and allows to make predictions for\nother observables. We also discuss connections between these ideas and other\ntheories of transitions to an incompressible quantum fluid.\n", "  We consider torsional oscillations that are trapped in a layer of\nspherical-hole (bubble) nuclear structure, which is expected to occur in the\ndeepest region of the inner crust of a neutron star. Because this layer\nintervenes between the phase of slab nuclei and the outer core of uniform\nnuclear matter, torsional oscillations in the bubble phase can be excited\nseparately from usual crustal torsional oscillations. We find from eigenmode\nanalyses for various models of the equation of state of uniform nuclear matter\nthat the fundamental frequencies of such oscillations are almost independent of\nthe incompressibility of symmetric nuclear matter, but strongly depend on the\nslope parameter of the nuclear symmetry energy $L$. Although the frequencies\nare also sensitive to the entrainment effect, i.e., what portion of nucleons\noutside bubbles contribute to the oscillations, by having such a portion fixed,\nwe can successfully fit the calculated fundamental frequencies of torsional\noscillations in the bubble phase inside a star of specific mass and radius as a\nfunction of $L$. By comparing the resultant fitting formula to the frequencies\nof quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) observed from the soft-gamma repeaters,\nwe find that each of the observed low-frequency QPOs can be identified either\nas a torsional oscillation in the bubble phase or as a usual crustal\noscillation, given generally accepted values of $L$ for all the stellar models\nconsidered here.\n", "  QCD sum rules for decay constants of heavy mesons with $u$ or $d$ quark yield\nfor $B$ mesons much less isospin breaking than lattice QCD but good agreement\nfor $D$ mesons.\n", "  Charged Higgs bosons are predicted in variety of theoretically well-motivated\nnew physics models with extended Higgs sectors. In this study, we focus on a\ntype-II two Higgs doublet model (2HDM-II) and consider a heavy charged Higgs\nwith its mass ranging from 500 GeV to 1 TeV as dictated by the $b\\to s\\gamma$\nconstraints which render $M_{H^\\pm}>480$ GeV. We study the dominant production\nmode $H^\\pm t$ associated production with $H^\\pm \\to W^\\pm A$ being the\ndominant decay channel when the pseudoscalar $A$ is considerably lighter. For\nsuch a heavy charged Higgs, both the decay products $W^\\pm$ and $A$ are\nrelatively boosted. In such a scenario, we apply the jet substructure analysis\nof tagging the fat pseudoscalar and $W$ jets in order to eliminate the standard\nmodel background efficiently. We perform a detailed detector simulation for the\nsignal and background processes at the 14 TeV LHC. We introduce various\nkinematical cuts to determine the signal significance for a number of benchmark\npoints with charged Higgs boson mass from 500 GeV to 1 TeV in the $W^\\pm A$\ndecay channel. Finally we perform a multivariate analysis utilizing a boosted\ndecision tree algorithm to optimize these significances.\n", "  Inelastic tunneling of electrons can generate the emission of photons with\nenergies intuitively limited by the applied bias voltage. However, experiments\nindicate that more complex processes involving the interaction of electrons\nwith plasmon polaritons lead to photon emission with overbias energies. We\nrecently proposed a model of this observation in Phys. Rev. Lett. \\textbf{113},\n066801 (2014), in analogy to the dynamical Coulomb blockade, originally\ndeveloped for treating the electromagnetic environment in mesoscopic circuits.\nThis model describes the correlated tunneling of two electrons interacting with\na local plasmon-polariton mode, represented by a resonant circuit, and shows\nthat the overbias emission is due to the non-Gaussian fluctuations. Here we\nextend our model to study the overbias emission at finite temperature. We find\nthat the thermal smearing strongly masks the overbias emission. Hence, the\ndetection of the correlated tunneling processes requires temperatures $k_BT$\nmuch lower than the bias energy $eV$ and the plasmon energy $\\hbar\\omega_0$, a\ncondition which is fortunately realized experimentally.\n", "  In the framework of the Floquet scattering-matrix theory we discuss how\nelectrical and heat currents accessible in mesoscopics are related to the state\nof excitations injected by a single-electron source into an electron waveguide.\nWe put forward an interpretation of a single-particle heat current, which\ndiffers essentially from that of an electrical current. We show that the\nknowledge of both a time-dependent electrical current and a time-dependent heat\ncurrent allows the full reconstruction of a single-electron wave function. In\naddition we compare electrical and heat shot noise caused by splitting of a\nregular stream of single-electron excitations. If only one stream impinges on a\nwave splitter, the heat shot noise is proportional to the well-known expression\nof the charge shot noise, reflecting the partitioning of the incoming single\nparticles. The situation differs when two electronic streams collide at the\nwave splitter. The shot noise suppression, due to the Pauli exclusion\nprinciple, is governed by different overlap integrals in the case of charge and\nof heat.\n", "  We revisit the nonthermal gravitino production at the (p)reheating stage\nafter inflation. Particular attention is paid to large field inflation models\nwith a $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry, for which the previous perturbative analysis is\ninapplicable; and inflation models with a stabilizer superfield, which have not\nbeen studied non-perturbatively. It is found that in single-superfield\ninflation models (without the stabilizer field), nonthermal production of the\ntransverse gravitino can be cosmologically problematic while the abundance of\nthe longitudinal gravitino is small enough. In multi-superfield inflation\nmodels (with the stabilizer field), production of the transverse and\nlongitudinal gravitinos is significantly suppressed, and they are\ncosmologically harmless. We also clarify the relation between the background\nfield method used in the preheating context and the standard perturbative decay\nmethod to estimate the gravitino abundance.\n", "  Radiological impact models are important tools that support nuclear safety.\nFor tritium, a special radionuclide that readily enters the life cycle, the\nprocesses involved in its transport into the environment are complex and\ninadequately understood. For example, tritiated water (HTO) enters plants by\nleaf and root uptake and is converted to organically bound tritium (OBT) in\nexchangeable and non-exchangeable forms; however, the observed OBT/HTO ratios\nin crops exhibit large variability and contradict the current models for\nroutine releases. Non-routine or spike releases of tritium further complicate\nthe prediction of OBT formation. The experimental data for a short and intense\natmospheric contamination of wheat are presented together with various models\npredictions. The experimental data on wheat demonstrate that the OBT formation\nis a long process, it is dependent on receptor location and stack dynamics,\nthere are differences between night and day releases, and the HTO dynamics in\nleaf and ear is a very important contributor to OBT formation.\n", "  Recent theoretical results on transport in a two-dimensional disordered\nelectron liquid with spin and isospin degrees of freedom are reviewed. A number\nof experimental features in temperature dependence of resistivity at low\ntemperatures in Si-MOSFET, n-AlAs quantum well and double quantum well\nheterostructures is explained. Novel behavior of low-temperature resistivity at\nlow temperature in electron systems with isospin degrees of freedom are\npredicted.\n", "  We show how strong light-mediated resonant dipole-dipole interactions between\natoms can be utilized in a control and storage of light. The method is based on\na high-fidelity preparation of a collective atomic excitation in a single\ncorrelated subradiant eigenmode in a lattice. We demonstrate how a simple\nphenomenological model captures the qualitative features of the dynamics and\nsharp transmission resonances that may find applications in sensing.\n", "  The TOTEM experiment at the CERN LHC has measured elastic proton-proton\nscattering at the centre-of-mass energy $\\sqrt{s}$ = 8 TeV and four-momentum\ntransfers squared, |t|, from 6 x $10^{-4}$ GeV$^2$ to 0.2 GeV$^2$. Near the\nlower end of the |t|-interval the differential cross-section is sensitive to\nthe interference between the hadronic and the electromagnetic scattering\namplitudes. This article presents the elastic cross-section measurement and the\nconstraints it imposes on the functional forms of the modulus and phase of the\nhadronic elastic amplitude. The data exclude the traditional Simplified West\nand Yennie interference formula that requires a constant phase and a purely\nexponential modulus of the hadronic amplitude. For parametrisations of the\nhadronic modulus with second- or third-order polynomials in the exponent, the\ndata are compatible with hadronic phase functions giving either central or\nperipheral behaviour in the impact parameter picture of elastic scattering. In\nboth cases, the $\\rho$-parameter is found to be 0.12 $\\pm$ 0.03. The results\nfor the total hadronic cross-section are $\\sigma_{tot}$ = (102.9 $\\pm$ 2.3) mb\nand (103.0 $\\pm$ 2.3) mb for central and peripheral phase formulations,\nrespectively. Both are consistent with previous TOTEM measurements.\n", "  We study the resonant tidal excitation of g modes in coalescing superfluid\nneutron star (NS) binaries and investigate how such tidal driving impacts the\ngravitational-wave (GW) signal of the inspiral. Previous studies of this type\ntreated the NS core as a normal fluid and thus did not account for its expected\nsuperfluidity. The source of buoyancy that supports the g modes is\nfundamentally different in the two cases: in a normal fluid core the buoyancy\nis due to gradients in the proton-to-neutron fraction whereas in a superfluid\ncore it is due to gradients in the muon-to-electron fraction. The latter yields\na stronger stratification and a superfluid NS therefore has a denser spectrum\nof g modes with frequencies above 10 Hz. As a result, many more g modes undergo\nresonant tidal excitation as the binary sweeps through the bandwidth of GW\ndetectors such as LIGO. We find that roughly 10 times more orbital energy is\ntransferred into g mode oscillations if the NS has a superfluid core rather\nthan a normal fluid core. However, because this energy is transferred later in\nthe inspiral when the orbital decay is faster, the accumulated phase error in\nthe gravitational waveform is comparable for a superfluid and a normal fluid NS\n(about 0.001-0.01 rad). A phase error of this magnitude is too small to be\nmeasured from a single event with the current generation of GW detectors.\n", "  We design photonic crystal waveguides with efficient chiral light--matter\ninterfaces that can be integrated with solid-state quantum emitters. By using\nglide-plane-symmetric waveguides, we show that chiral light-matter interaction\ncan exist even in the presence of slow light with slow-down factors of up to\n$100$ and therefore the light--matter interaction exhibits both strong Purcell\nenhancement and chirality. This allows for near-unity directional\n$\\beta$-factors for a range of emitter positions and frequencies. Additionally,\nwe design an efficient mode adapter to couple light from a standard nanobeam\nwaveguide to the glide-plane symmetric photonic crystal waveguide. Our work\nsets the stage for performing future experiments on a solid-state platform.\n", "  Gravitational wave (GW) detection in space is aimed at low frequency band\n(100 nHz - 100 mHz) and middle frequency band (100 mHz - 10 Hz). The science\ngoals are the detection of GWs from (i) Supermassive Black Holes; (ii)\nExtreme-Mass-Ratio Black Hole Inspirals; (iii) Intermediate-Mass Black Holes;\n(iv) Galactic Compact Binaries and (v) Relic GW Background. In this paper, we\npresent an overview on the sensitivity, orbit design, basic orbit\nconfiguration, angular resolution, orbit optimization, deployment, time-delay\ninterferometry and payload concept of the current proposed GW detectors in\nspace under study. The detector proposals under study have arm length ranging\nfrom 1000 km to 1.3 x 109 km (8.6 AU) including (a) Solar orbiting detectors --\nASTROD-GW (ASTROD [Astrodynamical Space Test of Relativity using Optical\nDevices] optimized for GW detection), BBO (Big Bang Observer), DECIGO\n(DECi-hertz Interferometer GW Observatory), e-LISA (evolved LISA [Laser\nInterferometer Space Antenna]), LISA, other LISA-type detectors such as ALIA,\nTAIJI etc. (in Earth-like solar orbits), and Super-ASTROD (in Jupiter-like\nsolar orbits); and (b) Earth orbiting detectors -- ASTROD-EM/LAGRANGE,\nGADFLI/GEOGRAWI/g-LISA, OMEGA and TIANQIN.\n", "  The Voyager 2 Radio Science Subsystem occultations of the Uranian alpha and\nbeta rings exhibit quasi-periodic optical depth variations with radial\nwavelengths that vary with longitude. These patterns may be wakes from small\nmoonlets orbiting exterior to these rings. Based on the observed structures in\nthe rings, we estimate that the moonlets would need to be located about 100 km\nexterior to the rings' semimajor axes and be 2-7 km in radius. Such moonlets\ncould help keep the rings confined. Due to their small radii and presumed low\nalbedo, the expected brightness of these moonlets is on the order of the noise\nin Voyager 2 images.\n", "  The thermoelectric properties of n type semiconductor, TiNiSn is optimized by\npartial substitution with metallic, MnNiSb in the half Heusler structure.\nHerein, we study the transport properties and intrinsic phase separation in the\nsystem. The Ti1-xMnxNiSn1-xSbx alloys were prepared by arc-melting and were\nannealed at temperatures obtained from differential thermal analysis and\ndifferential scanning calorimetry results. The phases were characterized using\npowder X-ray diffraction patterns, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and\ndifferential scanning calorimetry. After annealing the majority phase was\nTiNiSn with some Ni rich sites and the minority phases was majorly Ti6Sn5, Sn,\nand MnSn2. Ni rich sites were caused by Frenkel defects, this led to a\nmetal-like behavior of the semiconducting specimens at low temperature. For x\nup to 0.05 the samples showed an activated conduction, whereas for x>0.05 they\nshowed metallic character. The figure of merit for x=0.05 was increased by 61%\n(ZT=0.45) in comparison to the pure TiNiSn.\n", "  Since almost all phenomena electrodynamics deal with have energy scales much\nlower than the Higgs mass energy and intermediate boson energy, electrodynamics\nof continuous media should be applicable and the constitutive relation of\nspacetime/vacuum should be local and linear. What is the key characteristic of\nthe spacetime/vacuum? It is the Weak Equivalence Principle (WEP I) for\nphotons/wave packets of light which states that the spacetime trajectory of\nlight in a gravitational field depends only on its initial position and\ndirection of propagation, and does not depend on its frequency (energy) and\npolarization, i.e. nonbirefringence of light propagation in spacetime/vacuum.\nWith this principle it is proved by the author in 1981 in the weak field limit,\nand by Lammerzahl and Hehl in 2004 together with Favaro and Bergamin in 2011\nwithout assuming the weak-field condition that the constitutive tensor must be\nof the core metric form with only two additional degrees of freedom - the\npseudoscalar (Abelian axion or EM axion) degree of freedom and the scalar\n(dilaton) degree of freedom (i.e. metric with axion and dilaton). In this\npaper, we review this connection and the ultrahigh precision empirical tests of\nnonbirefringence together with present status of tests of cosmic Abelian axion\nand dilaton. If the stronger version of WEP is assumed, i.e. WEP II for photons\n(wave packets of light) which states in addition to WEP I also that the\npolarization state of the light would not change (e.g. no polarization rotation\nfor linear polarized light) and no amplification/attenuation of light, then no\nAbelian (EM) axion and no dilaton, and we have a pure metric theory.\n", "  With the LIGO announcement of the first direct detection of gravitational\nwaves (GWs), the GW Astronomy was formally ushered into our age. After\none-hundred years of theoretical investigation and fifty years of experimental\nendeavor, this is a historical landmark not just for physics and astronomy, but\nalso for industry and manufacturing. The challenge and opportunity for industry\nis precision and innovative manufacturing in large size - production of large\nand homogeneous optical components, optical diagnosis of large components, high\nreflectance dielectric coating on large mirrors, manufacturing of components\nfor ultrahigh vacuum of large volume, manufacturing of high attenuating\nvibration isolation system, production of high-power high-stability\nsingle-frequency lasers, production of high-resolution positioning systems etc.\nIn this talk, we address the requirements and methods to satisfy these\nrequirements. Optical diagnosis of large optical components requires large\nphase-shifting interferometer; the 1.06 {\\mu}m Phase Shifting Interferometer\nfor testing LIGO optics is an example. High quality mirrors are crucial for\nlaser interferometric GW detection, so as for ring laser gyroscope, high\nprecision laser stabilization via optical cavities, quantum optomechanics,\ncavity quantum electrodynamics and vacuum birefringence measurement. There are\nstringent requirements on the substrate materials and coating methods. For\ncryogenic GW interferometer, appropriate coating on sapphire or silicon are\nrequired for good thermal and homogeneity properties. Large ultrahigh vacuum\ncomponents and high attenuating vibration system together with an efficient\nmetrology system are required and will be addressed. For space interferometry,\ndrag-free technology is well-developed; weak-light phase locking is\ndemonstrated in the laboratories while weak-light manipulation technology still\nneeds developments.\n", "  We review the Eulerian description of hidrodynamics using Seliger-Whitham's\nformalism (in classical case) and Schutz's formalism (in relativistic case). In\nthese formalisms, the velocity field of a perfect fluid is described by scalar\npotentials. With this we can obtain the evolution equations of the fluid and\nits Hamiltonian. In the scenario of quantum cosmology the Schutz's formalism\nmakes it possible to introduce phenomenologically a time variable in\nminisuperspace models.\n", "  The topological phase transition is theoretically studied in a metallic\nsingle-wall carbon nanotube (SWNT) by applying a magnetic field $B$ parallel to\nthe tube. The $\\mathbb{Z}$ topological invariant, winding number, is changed\ndiscontinuously when a small band gap is closed at a critical value of $B$,\nwhich can be observed as a change in the number of edge states owing to the\nbulk-edge correspondence. This is confirmed by numerical calculations for\nfinite SWNTs of $\\sim$ 1 $\\mu$m length, using a one-dimensional lattice model\nto effectively describe the mixing between $\\sigma$ and $\\pi$ orbitals and\nspin-orbit interaction, which are relevant to the formation of the band gap in\nmetallic SWNTs.\n", "  We report that epitaxial Sr2IrO4 thin-films can be selectively grown using\npulsed laser deposition (PLD). Due to the competition between the\nRuddlesden-Popper phases of strontium iridates (Sr_{n+1}Ir_{n}O_{3n+1}),\nconventional PLD methods often result in mixed phases of Sr2IrO4 (n = 1),\nSr3Ir2O7 (n = 2), and SrIrO3 (n = infinity). We have discovered that reduced\nPLD plume dimensions and slow deposition rates are the key for stabilizing pure\nSr2IrO4 phase thin-films, identified by real-time in-situ monitoring of their\noptical spectra. The slow film deposition results in a thermodynamically stable\nTiO2\\\\SrO\\IrO2\\SrO\\SrO configuration at an interface rather than\nTiO2\\\\SrO\\SrO\\IrO2\\SrO between a TiO2-teminated SrTiO3 substrate and a Sr2IrO4\nthin film, which is consistent with other layered oxides grown by molecular\nbeam epitaxy. Our approach provides an effective method for using PLD to\nachieve pure phase thin-films of layered materials that are susceptible to\nseveral energetically competing phases.\n", "  We report an emergence of bifurcation in basketball, a single-particle system\ngoverned by Newtonian mechanics. When shooting the basketball, the obvious\ncontrol parameters are the launch speed and the launch angle. We propose to use\nthe three-dimensional velocity phase-space volume associated with the given\nlaunch parameters to quantify the difficulty of the shooting. The optimal\nlaunch angle that maximizes the associated phase-space volume undergoes a\nbifurcation as the launch speed is increased, if the shooter is farther than a\ncritical distance away from the hoop. Thus, the bifurcation makes it very\nimportant to control the launch speed accurately. If the air resistance is\nremoved, the bifurcation disappears and the phase-space volume distribution\nbecomes dispersionless and shrinks in magnitude.\n", "  For the benefit of the readers of this journal, the editors requested that we\nprepare a brief review of the history of the development of the theory, the\nexperimental attempts to detect them, and the recent direct observations of\ngravitational waves (GWs). The theoretical ideas and disputes beginning with\nEinstein in 1916 regarding the existence and nature of GWs and the extent to\nwhich one can rely on the electromagnetic analogy, especially the controversies\nregarding the quadrupole formula and whether GWs carry energy, are discussed.\nThe theoretical conclusions eventually received strong observational support\nfrom the binary pulsar. This provided compelling, although indirect, evidence\nfor GWs carrying away energy--as predicted by the quadrupole formula. On the\ndirect detection experimental side, Weber started more than 50 years ago. In\n1966, his bar for GW detection reached a strain sensitivity of a few times\n10^-16. His announcement of coincident signals (now considered spurious)\nstimulated many experimental efforts from room temperature resonant masses to\ncryogenic detectors and laser-interferometers. Now there are km-sized\ninterferometric detectors (LIGO Hanford, LIGO Livingston, Virgo and KAGRA).\nAdvanced LIGO first reached a strain sensitivity of the order of 10^-22. During\ntheir first 130 days of observation (O1 run), with the aid of templates\ngenerated by numerical relativity, they did make the first detections: two\n5-sigma GW events and one likely event. Besides earth-based GW detectors, the\ndrag-free sensitivity of the LISA Pathfinder has already reached to the LISA\ngoal level, paving the road for space GW detectors. Over the whole GW spectrum\n(from aHz to THz) there are efforts for detection, notably the\nvery-low-frequency band (pulsar timing array [PTA], 300 pHz-100 nHz) and the\nextremely-low (Hubble)-frequency (cosmic microwave background [CMB] experiment,\n1 aHz-10 fHz).\n", "  Although it was found that the FeH lines exist in the spectra of some stars,\nnone of the spectral features in the ISM have been assigned to this molecule.\nWe suggest that iron atoms interact with hydrogen and produce Fe-H\nnanoparticles which sometimes contain many H atoms. We calculate infrared\nspectra of hydrogenated iron nanoparticles using density functional theory\nmethods and find broad, overlapping bands. Desorption of H2 could induce\nspinning of these small Fe-H dust grains. Some of hydrogenated iron\nnanoparticles posses magnetic and electric moments and should interact with\nelectromagnetic fields in the ISM. Fe_nH_m nanoparticles could contribute to\nthe polarization of the ISM and the anomalous microwave emission. We discuss\nthe conditions required to form FeH and Fe_nH_m in the ISM.\n", "  In the last two decades we have seen important mutual stimulations between\nthe community working on electrodynamics of continuous media and the community\nworking on spacetime structure. This is highlighted by the publication of two\nimportant monographs from two communities: Foundations of Classical\nElectrodynamics by F. W. Hehl and Yu. N. Obukhov (Birkh\\\"auser, Boston 2003)\nand Differential Forms in Electromagnetics by I. V. Lindell (IEEE Press-Wiley,\nPiscataway, NJ 2004; see also a new book \"Multiforms, Dyadics, and\nElectromagnetic Media\" by the same author in 2015). Starting around 1960,\nmagnetoelectric effects and magnetoelectric media have been a focus of study.\nSomewhat later, the constitutive tensor density framework was used to construct\nspacetime structure theoretically and empirically. Earlier, in putting Maxwell\nequations into a form compatible with general relativity, Einstein noticed that\nthe Maxwell equations can be formulated in a form independent of the metric\ngravitational potential in 1916; only the constitutive tensor density depends\non the metric. This was followed by further stimulating and clarifying works of\nWeyl in 1918, Murnaghan in 1921, Kottler in 1922 and Cartan in 1923. Year 2016\nis the centennial of the start of this historical development. International\nJournal of Modern Physics D of World Scientific is celebrating the occasion by\npublishing this special issue on Spacetime Structure and Electrodynamics. We\nhave invited researchers to submit original research articles that would\ncontribute to a better understanding of the phenomena inherent to spacetime\nstructure and electrodynamic media.\n", "  One of the leading scenarios for the formation of nuclear star clusters in\ngalaxies is related to the orbital decay of globular clusters (GCs) and their\nsubsequent merging, though alternative theories are currently debated. The\navailability of high-quality data for GCs structural and orbital parameters\nallow to test different nuclear star cluster formation scenarios. The Fornax\ndwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxy is the heaviest satellite of the Milky Way and\nit is the only known dwarf spheroidal hosting 5 GCs, whereas there are no clear\nsignatures for the presence of a central massive black hole. For this reason,\nit represents a suited place to study the orbital decay process in dwarf\ngalaxies. In this paper we model the future evolution of the Fornax GCs\nsimulating them and the host galaxy by means of direct $N$-body simulations.\nOur simulations take in account also the gravitational field generated by the\nMilky Way. We found that if the Fornax galaxy is embedded in a standard Cold\nDark Matter Halo, the nuclear cluster formation would be significantly hampered\nby the high central galactic mass density. In this context, we discuss the\npossibility that infalling GCs drive the flattening of the galactic density\nprofile, giving a possible alternative explanation to the so-called cusp/core\nproblem. Moreover, we briefly discuss the link between GC infall process and\nthe absence of massive black holes in the centre of dSphs.\n", "  In the light of recent experimental developments, increasing attention is\ndevoted to nuclear phenomena related to rotational excitations of exotic\nintrinsic nuclear configurations that often lack symmetries present in the\nmajority of nuclei. Examples include configurations with a non-vanishing\noctupole moment. In order to describe this kind of states, we have developed a\nnew computer code to solve the self-consistent mean-field equations, able to\nuse most of today's effective Skyrme interactions and working in\ncoordinate-space. We report on the development of MOCCa, a code based on the\nsame principles as EV8, but offering the user individual control on many\nsymmetry assumptions. In addition, the HF+BCS pairing treatment of EV8 has been\ngeneralised to the full machinery of Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov transformations.\nWe discuss as example the static fission barrier of $^{226}$Ra, prefacing\nextended studies in the region, using the recent series of Skyrme\nparameterizations SLy5s1 through SLy5s8.\n", "  We extend the k-inflation which is a type of kinetically driven inflationary\nmodel under the standard inflationary scenario to a possible warm inflationary\nscenario. The dynamical equations of this warm k-inflation model are obtained.\nWe rewrite the slow-roll parameters which are different from the usual\npotential driven inflationary models and perform a linear stability analysis to\ngive the proper slow-roll conditions in the warm k-inflation. Two cases, a\npower-law kinetic function and an exponential kinetic function, are studied,\nwhen the dissipative coefficient $\\Gamma=\\Gamma_0$ and $\\Gamma=\\Gamma(\\phi)$,\nrespectively. A proper number of e-folds is obtained in both concrete cases of\nwarm k-inflation. We find a constant dissipative coefficient\n($\\Gamma=\\Gamma_0$) is not a workable choice for these two cases while the two\ncases with $\\Gamma=\\Gamma(\\phi)$ are self-consistent warm inflationary models.\n", "  Steady-state manifolds of open quantum systems, such as decoherence-free\nsubspaces and noiseless subsystems, are of great practical importance to the\nend of quantum information processing. Yet, it is a difficult problem to find\nsteady-state manifolds of open quantum systems, especially of non-Markovian\nsystems. In this paper, we propose an approach to find the steady-state\nmanifolds, which is generally applicable to both Markovian and non-Markovian\nsystems. Our approach is based on an arbitrarily given steady state, and by\nfollowing the standard steps of the approach, the steady-state manifold on the\nsupport subspace of the given state can be obtained. Our work reduces the\nproblem of finding a manifold of steady states to that of finding only one\nsteady state, which is indeed an interesting progress towards completely\nsolving the difficult problem. Besides, in deriving our approach, we introduce\nthe notions of the modified noise algebra and its commutant, and prove two\ntheorems on the structure of steady-state manifolds of general open systems,\nwhich themselves are interesting findings too.\n", "  Graphene nanomeshes (GNMs), formed by creating a superlattice of pores in\ngraphene, possess rich physical and chemical properties. Many of these\nproperties are determined by the pore geometry. In this work, we use first\nprinciples calculations to study the magnetic and electronic properties of\nmetal-doped nitrogen-passivated GNMs. We find that the magnetic behaviour is\ndependent on the pore shape (trigonal vs. hexagonal) as dictated by the number\nof covalent bonds formed between the 3$d$ metal and the passivating N atoms. We\nalso find that Cr and V doped trigonal-pore GNMs, and Ti doped GNMs are the\nmost favourable for spintronic applications. The calculated magnetic properties\nof Fe-doped GNMs compare well with recent experimental observations. The\nstudied systems are useful as spin filters and chemical sensors.\n", "  Background: Data fitting approaches to modeling allow for parametric formulae\nthat may not reveal the physical quantities involved and their influence on the\nfunction being studied. In this paper the author models the approach to\nequilibrium function by a method that allows the physical quantities to be\ndefined beforehand, allows their influence to be studied, and can be used to\npredict how each physical quantity affects approach to equilibrium. Methods: An\nordinary differential equation (ODE) is used to model the approach to\nequilibrium function for the case where collimation is changed at fixed\ndetector size. A parallel model is used to study the approach to equilibrium as\na function of detector size for fixed collimation. Both models are validated by\nexperimental measurements in a 60cm body phantom. Influence of detector size is\nsimulated by using leaded sleeves of varying sizes wrapped around a 100mm\npencil chamber. This creates sleeve gaps of 10 - 60mm around the chamber. A\n100mm detector size is the pencil chamber without a leaded sleeve. Results:\nModel accurately describes the experimental data for the cases studied. Except\nfor the smallest collimation of 5mm, linear regression analysis shows good\ncorrelation between data and model according to the R^2 values at all\ncollimations. Further analysis of the model reveals minimum detector size that\nwill integrate 98% of the signal for a given collimation is, d=4.95L.\nAdditional analysis shows the minimum collimation at which a given detector\nwill collect 98% of the signal is, L=5.49d. Conclusion: Modeling by\ndifferential equations is an accurate method for the approach to equilibrium\nfunction, and has advantages over curve fitting methods.\n", "  The reported diffusion constants for hydrogen in silicon vary over six orders\nof magnitude. This spread in measured values is caused by the different\nconcentrations of defects in the silicon that has been studied. Hydrogen\ndiffusion is slowed down as it interacts with impurities. By changing the\nmaterial properties such as the crystallinity, doping type and impurity\nconcentrations, the diffusivity of hydrogen can be changed by several orders of\nmagnitude. In this study the influence of the hydrogen concentration on the\ntemperature dependence of the diffusion in high energy proton implanted silicon\nis investigated. We show that the Arrhenius parameters, which describe this\ntemperature dependence decrease with increasing hydrogen concentration. We\npropose a model where the relevant defects that mediate hydrogen diffusion\nbecome saturated with hydrogen at high concentrations. When the defects that\nprovide hydrogen with the lowest energy positions in the lattice are saturated,\nhydrogen resides at energetically less favorable positions and this increases\nthe diffusion of hydrogen through the crystal. Furthermore, we present a survey\nof different studies on the diffusion of hydrogen. We observed a correlation of\nthe Arrhenius parameters calculated in those studies, leading to a modification\nof the Arrhenius equation for the diffusion of hydrogen in silicon.\n", "  We report differences in adsorption and reaction energetics for ethylene on\nSi(001) with respect to different dangling bond configurations induced by\nhydrogen precoverage as obtained via density functional theory calculations.\nThis can help to understand the influence of surface defects and precoverage on\nthe reactivity of organic molecules on semiconductor surfaces in general. Our\nresults show that the reactivity on surface dimers fully enclosed by hydrogen\ncovered atoms is essentially unchanged compared to the clean surface. This is\nconfirmed by our scanning tunnelling microscopy measurements. On the contrary,\nadsorption sites with partially covered surface dimers show a drastic increase\nin reactivity. This is due to a lowering of the reaction barrier by more than\nfifty percent compared to the clean surface, which is in line with previous\nexperiments. Adsorption on dimers enclosed by molecule (ethylene) covered\nsurface atoms is reported to have a highly decreased reactivity, a result of\ndestabilization of the intermediate state due to steric repulsion, as\nquantified with the periodic energy decomposition analysis (pEDA). Furthermore,\nan approach for the calculation of Gibbs energies of adsorption based on\nstatistical thermodynamics considerations is applied to the system. The results\nshow that the loss in molecular entropy leads to a significant destabilization\nof adsorption states.\n", "  The Astronomical Diaries from Babylonia (ADB) are an excellent source of\ninformation of natural phenomena, including astronomical ones, in pre-Christ\nera because it contains the record of highly continuous and systematic\nobservations. In this article we present results of a survey of aurora-like\nphenomena in ADB, spanning from BCE 652 to BCE 61. We have found 9 records of\naurora-like phenomena. Philological and scientific examinations suggest 5 of\nthem can be considered as likely candidate for aurora observations. They\nprovide unique information about the solar and aurora activities in the first\nmillennium BCE.\n", "  In this note we consider the four-point function of identical scalar\noperators in its Mellin representation. For CFTs, taking the large scaling\ndimension limit of the Mellin amplitude yields the flat-space S-matrix. Using\nthis correspondence, and assuming that the Regge-limit of the Mellin amplitude\nvanishes, we prove that the resulting flat space S-matrix must have string-like\nlinear Regge trajectory in the limit |s|>>|t|>>1. We also show that the Regge\nlimit of Mellin amplitude is captured by the three-point coefficient of two\nscalars and one double trace operator in the large-spin limit. Using this, we\ncan see that vanishing Regge behaviour occurs at small t'Hooft limit.\n", "  The second version of the catalog contains information about 275 stars of\ndifferent types. During the time that has elapsed since the creation of the\nfirst catalog, situation fundamentally changed primarily due to the significant\nincrease of accuracy of magnetic fields (MF) measurements. Up to now global\nmagnetic field were discoverd and measured in stars of many types and their\nbehavior partially was studied. Magnetic behavior of Ap Bp stars is the most\nthoroughly studied. The catalog contains information about 182 such objects.\nThe main goals for the construction of the catalog are: 1. Review and summarize\nour kowledge about magnetic behavior of different types of stars. 2. The whole\ndata are uniformly presented and processed which will allow one to perform\nstatistical analysis of the variability of the (longitudinal) magnetic fields\nof stars. 3. The informations are presented in the most convenient form for\ntesting different theoretical models of different kind. 4. The catalog will be\nuseful for the development of observational programs.\n", "  The conformable time fractional forms of some partial differential equations\nare solved in the study. The existence of chain rule and the derivative of\ncomposite function enable the equations to be reduced to some ordinary\ndifferential equations by using some particular wave transformations. The\nmodified Kudryashov method implemented to derive the exact solutions for the\nBenjamin-Bona Mahony (BBM), the symmetric BBM and the equal width (EW)\nequations in the conformable fractional time derivative forms. The obtained\nexplicit solutions are illustrated for some time fractional orders in the\ninterval $(0,1]$.\n", "  Microstructure emission, involving short time scale, often quasi-periodic,\nintensity fluctuations in subpulse emission, is well known in normal period\npulsars. In this letter, we present the first detections of quasi-periodic\nmicrostructure emission from millisecond pulsars (MSPs), from Giant Metrewave\nRadio Telescope (GMRT) observations of two MSPs at 325 and 610 MHz. Similar to\nthe characteristics of microstructure observed in normal period pulsars, we\nfind that these features are often highly polarized, and exhibit quasi-periodic\nbehavior on top of broader subpulse emission, with periods of the order of a\nfew $\\mu$s. By measuring their widths and periodicities from single pulse\nintensity profiles and their autocorrelation functions, we extend the\nmicrostructure timescale - rotation period relationship by more than an order\nof magnitude down to rotation periods $\\sim$ 5 ms, and find it to be consistent\nwith the relationship derived earlier for normal pulsars. The similarity of\nbehavior is remarkable, given the significantly different physical properties\nof MSPs and normal period pulsars, and rules out several previous speculations\nabout the possible different characteristics of microstructure in MSP radio\nemission. We discuss the possible reasons for the non-detection of these\nfeatures in previous high time resolution MSP studies along with the physical\nimplications of our results, both in terms of a geometric beam sweeping model\nand temporal modulation model for micropulse production.\n", "  Biological microswimmers often inhabit a porous or crowded environment such\nas soil. In order to understand how such a complex environment influences their\nspreading, we numerically study non-interacting active Brownian particles\n(ABPs) in a two-dimensional random Lorentz gas. Close to the percolation\ntransition in the Lorentz gas, they perform the same subdiffusive motion as\nballistic and diffusive particles. However, due to their persistent motion they\nreach their long-time dynamics faster than passive particles and also show\nsuperdiffusive motion at intermediate times. While above the critical obstacle\ndensity $\\eta_c$ the ABPs are trapped, their long-time diffusion below $\\eta_c$\nis strongly influenced by the propulsion speed $v_0$. With increasing $v_0$,\nABPs are stuck at the obstacles for longer times. Thus, for large propulsion\nspeed, the long-time diffusion constant decreases more strongly in a denser\nobstacle environment than for passive particles. This agrees with the behavior\nof an effective swimming velocity and persistence time, which we extract from\nthe velocity autocorrelation function.\n", "  We consider a simple model for QCD dynamics in which DGLAP\nintegro-differential equation may be solved analytically. This is a gauge model\nwhich possesses dominant evolution of gauge boson (gluon) distribution and in\nwhich the gauge coupling does not run. This may be ${\\cal N} =4$ supersymmetric\ngauge theory with softly broken supersymmetry, other finite supersymmetric\ngauge theory with lower level of supersymmetry, or topological Chern-Simons\nfield theories. We maintain only one term in the splitting function of\nunintegrated gluon distribution and solve DGLAP analytically for this\nsimplified splitting function. The solution is found by use of the Cauchy\nintegral formula. The solution restricts form of the unintegrated gluon\ndistribution as function of transfer momentum and of Bjorken $x$. Then we\nconsider an almost realistic splitting function of unintegrated gluon\ndistribution as an input to DGLAP equation and solve it by the same method\nwhich we have developed to solve DGLAP equation for the toy-model. We study a\nresult obtained for the realistic gluon distribution and find a singular\nBessel-like behaviour in the vicinity of the point $x=0$ and a smooth behaviour\nin the vicinity of the point $x=1.$\n", "  Introductory lectures on SCET mainly following the first chapters of\narXiv:1410.1892\n", "  Chitosan (CT) is an antibacterial polysaccharide that has been investigated\nfor drug carriers, haemostats and wound dressings. For these applications,\ncustomised CT devices can often be obtained with specific experimental\nconditions, which can irreversibly alter native biopolymer properties and\nfunctions and lead to unreliable material behaviour. In order to investigate\nthe structure-function relationships in CT covalent networks, monosodium\n5-sulfoisophthalate (PhS) was selected as heparin-mimicking, growth\nfactor-binding crosslinking segment, whilst 1,4-phenylenediacetic acid (4Ph)\nand poly(ethylene glycol) bis(carboxymethyl) ether (PEG) were employed as\nsulfonic acid-free diacids of low and high crosslinker length respectively.\nHydrogels based on short crosslinkers (PhS and 4Ph) displayed increased\ncrosslink density, decreased swelling ratio as well as minimal hydrolytic and\nlysozymic degradation, whilst addition of lysozymes to PEG based networks\nresulted in 70 wt.-% mass loss. PhS-crosslinked CT hydrogels displayed the\nhighest loss (40 +/- 6 CFU%) of antibacterial activity upon incubation with\nPorphyromonas gingivalis, whilst respective extracts were tolerated by L929\nmouse fibroblasts.\n", "  We show that a pseudospectral representation of the wavefunction using\nmultiple spatial domains of variable size yields a highly accurate, yet\nefficient method to solve the time-dependent Schr\\\"odinger equation. The\noverall spatial domain is split into non-overlapping intervals whose size is\nchosen according to the local de Broglie wavelength. A multi-domain weak\nformulation of the Schr\\\"odinger equation is obtained by representing the\nwavefunction by Lagrange polynomials with compact support in each domain,\ndiscretized at the Legendre-Gauss-Lobatto points. The resulting Hamiltonian is\nsparse, allowing for efficient diagonalization and storage. Accurate time\nevolution is carried out by the Chebychev propagator, involving only sparse\nmatrix-vector multiplications. Our approach combines the efficiency of mapped\ngrid methods with the accuracy of spectral representations based on Gaussian\nquadrature rules and the stability and convergence properties of polynomial\npropagators. We apply this method to high-harmonic generation and examine the\nrole of the initial state for the harmonic yield near the cutoff.\n", "  Cavity photon resonators with ultrastrong light-matter interactions are\nattracting interest both in semiconductor and superconducting systems\ndisplaying the capability to manipulate the cavity quantum electrodynamic\nground state with controllable physical properties. Here we review a series of\nexperiments aimed at probing the ultrastrong light-matter coupling regime,\nwhere the vacuum Rabi splitting $\\Omega$ is comparable to the bare transition\nfrequency $\\omega$ . We present a new platform where the inter-Landau level\ntransition of a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) is strongly coupled to the\nfundamental mode of deeply subwavelength split-ring resonators operating in the\nmm-wave range. Record-high values of the normalized light-matter coupling ratio\n$\\frac{\\Omega}{\\omega}= 0.89$ are reached and the system appears highly\nscalable far into the microwave range.\n", "  We propose an arterial network model based on 1D blood hemodynamic equations\nto study the behavior of different vascular surgical bypass grafts in case of\nan arterial occlusive pathology: an obliteration or stenosis of the iliac\nartery. We investigate the performances of three different bypass grafts\n(Aorto-Femoral, Axillo-Femoral and cross-over Femoral) depending on the degree\nof obliteration of the stenosis. Numerical simulations show that all bypass\ngrafts are efficient since we retrieve in all cases the normal hemodynamics in\nthe stenosed region while ensuring at the same time a global healthy\ncirculation. We analyze in particular the Axillo-Femoral bypass graft by\nperforming hundreds of simulations by varying the values of the Young's modulus\n[0.1--50 MPa] and the radius [0.01--5 cm] of the bypass graft. We show that the\nYoung's modulus and radius of commercial bypass grafts are optimal in terms of\nhemodynamic considerations. The numerical findings prove that this approach\ncould be used to optimize or plan surgeries for specific patients, to perform\nparameter's statistics and error propagation evaluations by running extensive\nsimulations, or to characterize numerically specific bypass grafts.\n", "  Recalling the state of the art in the interpretation of quantum physics, this\npaper emphasizes that one cannot simply add a collapse parameter to the\nSchr\\~A{\\P}dinger equation in order to solve the measurement problem. If one\ndoes so, one is also committed to a primitive ontology of a configuration of\nmatter in physical space in order to have something in the ontology that\nconstitutes the determinate measurement outcomes. The paper then argues that in\nthe light of this consequence, the collapse postulate loses its attractiveness\nin comparison to an ontology of persisting particles moving on continuous\ntrajectories according to a deterministic law.\n", "  We introduce an analogue model for a nonglobally hyperbolic spacetime in\nterms of a two-dimensional fluid. This is done by considering the propagation\nof sound waves in a radial flow with constant velocity. We show that the\nequation of motion satisfied by sound waves is the wave equation on\n$AdS_2\\times S^1$. Since this spacetime is not globally hyperbolic, the\ndynamics of the Klein-Gordon field is not well defined until boundary\nconditions at the spatial boundary of $AdS_2$ are prescribed. On the analogue\nmodel end, those extra boundary conditions provide an effective description of\nthe point source at $r=0$. For waves with circular symmetry, we relate the\ndifferent physical evolutions to the phase difference between ingoing and\noutgoing scattered waves. We also show that the fluid configuration can be\nstable or unstable depending on the chosen boundary condition.\n", "  Recently, DeLaunay et al. (2016) discovered a gamma-ray transient, Swift\nJ0644.5-5111, associated with the fast radio burst (FRB) 131104. They also\nreported follow-up broadband observations beginning two days after the FRB and\nprovided upper limits on a putative afterglow of this transient. In this paper,\nwe show that if such a transient drives a relativistic shock as in a\ncosmological gamma-ray burst (GRB), these upper limits are consistent with an\nenvironment of which density is much less than that of an interstellar medium\nbut typical for the outskirts' density of a galaxy when the typical values of\nthree microphysical parameters of the shock are taken. This appears to be\ninconsistent with the catastrophic event models in which the central engine of\nSwift J0644.5-5111 is surrounded by an interstellar medium, but together with\nthe properties of the gamma-ray transient, favors the binary neutron star\nmerger origin. We further constrain the physical parameters of the postmerger\nobject by assuming that Swift J0644.5-5111 results from internal dissipation of\na spinning-down pulsar wind, and we find that the postmerger object is an\nultra-strongly magnetized, very rapidly rotating pulsar. This merger event\nshould have given birth to a gravitational wave burst, an FRB, and a short GRB\nor an extended X-ray/gamma-ray emission if a relativistic jet of the GRB is\nmissed. Such \"triplets\" would be testable in the near future with the advanced\nLIGO and Virgo gravitational-wave observatories.\n", "  Thirty years ago Breneman and Stone observed that the enhancement or\nsuppression of element abundances in large solar energetic-particle (SEP)\nevents varies as a power of the mass-to-charge ratio, A/Q, of the elements.\nSince Q during acceleration or transport may depend upon the source plasma\ntemperature T, the pattern of element enhancements can provide a best-fit\nmeasure of T. The small SEP events we call 3He-rich or \"impulsive\" show average\nenhancements, relative to coronal abundances, rising as the 3.6 power of A/Q to\na factor of ~1000 for (76<=Z<=82)/O and temperature in the range 2-4 MK. This\nacceleration is believed to occur in islands of magnetic reconnection on open\nfield lines in solar flares and jets. It has been recently found that the large\nshock-accelerated \"gradual\" SEP events have a broad range of source plasma\ntemperatures; 69% have coronal temperatures of T < 1.6 MK, while 24% have T ~ 3\nMK, the latter suggesting a seed population containing residual impulsive\nsuprathermal ions. Most of the large event-to-event abundance variations and\ntheir time variation are largely explained by variations in T magnified by\nA/Q-dependent fractionation during transport. However, the non-thermal variance\nof impulsive SEP events (~30%) exceeds that of the ~3 MK gradual events (~10%)\nso that several small impulsive events must be averaged together with the\nambient plasma to form the seed population for shock acceleration in these\nevents.\n", "  Among the central tenets of globalization is free migration of labor.\nAlthough much has been written about its benefits, little is known about the\nlimitations of globalization, including how immigration affects the\nanti-globalist sentiment. Analyzing polls data, we find that over the last\nthree years in a group of EU countries affected by the recent migrant crisis,\nthe percentage of right-wing (RW) populist voters in a given country depends on\nthe prevalence of immigrants in this country's population and the total\nimmigration inflow into the entire EU. The latter is likely due to the EU\nresembling a supranational state, where the lack of inner borders causes that\n\"somebody else's problem\" easily turns into \"my problem\". We further find that\nthe increase in the percentage of RW voters substantially surpasses the\nimmigration inflow, implying that if this process continues, RW populism may\ndemocratically prevail and eventually lead to a demise of globalization. We\npresent evidence for tipping points in relation to the rise of RW populism.\nFinally, we model these empirical findings using a complex network framework\nwherein the success of globalization largely rests on the balance between\nimmigration and immigrant integration.\n", "  It is argued that alternative electrodynamics of superconductivity proposed\nby Hirsch lacks mathematical rigour and it is conceptually flawed. Gauge\nnon-invariance of the theory makes justification of the experiment reported in\n[arXiv:1607.05060] to test its prediction doubtful. It seems even with improved\ntechniques the outcome would remain inconclusive.\n", "  Twisted bilayer graphene offers a unique bilayer two-dimensional-electron\nsystem where the layer separation is only in sub-nanometer scale. Unlike\nBernal-stacked bilayer, the layer degree of freedom is disentangled from spin\nand valley, providing eight-fold degeneracy in the low energy states. We have\ninvestigated broken-symmetry quantum Hall (QH) states and their transitions due\nto the interplay of the relative strength of valley, spin and layer\npolarizations in twisted bilayer graphene. The energy gaps of the\nbroken-symmetry QH states show an electron-hole asymmetric behaviour, and their\ndependence on the induced displacement field are opposite between even and odd\nfilling factor states. These results strongly suggest that the QH states with\nbroken valley and spin symmetries for individual layer become hybridized via\ninterlayer tunnelling, and the hierarchy of the QH states is sensitive to both\nmagnetic field and displacement field due to charge imbalance between layers.\n", "  In this paper we discuss the laws of thermodynamics for interacting tachyonic\nscalar field. The components of the tachyonic scalar field in the universe are\ntaken to exist in the state of non-equilibrium initially, but due to\ninteraction they undergo a transition towards the equilibrium state. We show\nthat the zeroth law of thermodynamics demands interaction among the components\nof cosmic field. The second law of thermodynamics is governing dynamics in\ntransfer of energy among the three components of the proposed field with local\nviolation of conservation of energy for individual components.\n", "  These lectures were prepared for the 2014 PCMI graduate summer school and\nwere designed to be a lightweight introduction to statistical mechanics for\nmathematicians. The applications feature some of the themes of the summer\nschool: sphere packings and tilings.\n", "  Ionic liquids (ILs) are an emerging group of chemical compounds which possess\npromising properties such as having negligible vapor pressure. These so called\ndesigner solvents have the potential to replace volatile organic compounds in\nindustrial applications. A large number of ILs, through the combination of\ndifferent cations and anions, can potentially be synthesized. In this context,\nit will be useful to intelligently design customized ILs through computer-aided\nmethods. Practical limitations dictate that any successful attempt to design\nnew ILs for industrial applications requires the ability to accurately predict\ntheir melting point and viscosity as experimental data will not be available\nfor designed structures. In this paper, we present two new correlation\nequations towards the more precise prediction of melting point and viscosity of\nILs solely based on the inputs from quantum chemistry calculations (no\nexperimental data or simulation results are needed). To develop these\ncorrelations we utilized data related to size, shape, and electrostatic\nproperties of cations and anions that constitutes ILs. In this work, new\ndescriptors such as dielectric energy of cations and anions as well as the\nvalues predicted by an ad-hoc model for the radii of cations and anions\n(instead of their van der waals radii) were used. An enormous form of\ncorrelation equations constituent of all different combinations of descriptors\n(as the inputs to the model) were tested. The average relative errors were\nmeasured to be 3.16% and 6.45% for the melting point, Tm, and ln(vis),\nrespectively.\n", "  Variable mass systems are a classic example of open systems in classical\nmechanics. The reaction forces due to mass variation propel ships, balloons,\nand rockets. Unlike free constant mass systems, the angular momentum of these\nsystems is not of constant magnitude due to the change in mass. In this paper,\nwe show that the angular momentum vector for such a system has a fixed\ndirection in space and, thus, is partially conserved for both rigid and\nflexible, torque-free, variable mass systems. A potential use of this result is\nthat it provides a suitable stationary reference frame against which the\norientation of variable mass system could be measured.\n", "  We study elastic interactions between colloidal particles and deformation\nlandscapes of undulations in a cholesteric liquid crystal under an electric\nfield applied normal to cholesteric layers. The onset of undulation instability\nis influenced by the presence of colloidal inclusions and, in turn, layers'\nundulations mediate the spatial patterning of particle locations. We find that\nthe bending of cholesteric layers around a colloidal particle surface prompts\nthe local nucleation of an undulations lattice at electric fields below the\nwell-defined threshold known for liquid crystals without inclusions, and that\nthe onset of the resulting lattice is locally influenced, both dimensionally\nand orientationally, by the initial arrangements of colloids defined using\nlaser tweezers. Spherical particles tend to spatially localize in the regions\nof strong distortions of the cholesteric layers, while colloidal nanowires\nexhibit an additional preference for multistable alignment offset along various\nvectors of the undulations lattice. Magnetic rotation of superparamagnetic\ncolloidal particles couples with the locally distorted helical axis and\nundulating cholesteric layers in a manner that allows for a controlled\nthree-dimensional translation of these particles. These interaction modes lend\ninsight into the physics of liquid crystal structure-colloid elastic\ninteractions, as well as point the way towards guided self-assembly of\nreconfigurable colloidal composites with potential applications in diffraction\noptics and photonics.\n", "  After 10 years of struggling to simultaneously describe the nuclear\nmodification factor $R_{AA}$ and flow harmonics $v_n$'s at high $p_T$, now\ntheoretical models are able to reproduce experimental data well. The necessary\ntheoretical developments such as event-by-event fluctuations, choice of initial\nconditions, and the scalar product method to calculate flow harmonics at high\n$p_T$ are reviewed. Additionally, a discussion of new proposed experimental\nobservables known as Soft Hard Event Engineering (SHEE) that are sensitive to\nthe path length dependence of the energy loss is included.\n", "  Statistical interpretation of sparsely sampled event rates has become vital\nfor new transient surveys, particularly those aimed at detecting fast radio\nbursts (FRBs). We provide an accessible reference for a number of simple, but\ncritical, statistical questions relevant for current transient and FRB research\nand utilizing the negative binomial model for counts in which the count rate\nparameter is uncertain or randomly biased from one study to the next. We apply\nthese methods to re-assess and update results from previous FRB surveys,\nfinding as follows. 1) Thirteen FRBs detected across five\nhigh-Galactic-latitude (> 30$^\\circ$) surveys are highly significant $(p =\n5\\times 10^{-5})$ evidence of a higher rate relative to the single FRB detected\nacross four low-latitude (< 5$^\\circ$) surveys, even after accounting for\neffects that dampen Galactic plane sensitivity. High- vs. mid-latitude (5 to\n15$^\\circ$) is marginally significant $(p = 0.03)$. 2) A meta analysis of\ntwelve heterogeneous surveys gives an FRB rate of 2866 sky$^{-1}$ day$^{-1}$\nabove 1 Jy at high Galactic latitude (95% confidence 1121 to 7328) and 285\nsky$^{-1}$ day$^{-1}$ at low/mid latitudes (95% from 48 to 1701). 3) Using the\nParkes HTRU high-latitude setup requires 193 observing hours to achieve 50%\nprobability of detecting an FRB and 937 hours to achieve 95% probability, based\non the ten detections of (Champion et al. 2016) and appropriately accounting\nfor uncertainty in the unknown Poisson rate. 4) Two quick detections at Parkes\nfrom a small number of high-latitude fields (Ravi et al. 2015; Petroff et al.\n2015) tentatively favor a look long survey style relative to the scan wide HTRU\nsurvey, but only at $p = 0.07$ significance.\n", "  Spin-degrees of freedom play a significant role in exotic nuclei. Scattering\nwith polarized protons has potential as a powerful tool to explore the spin\neffects in nuclei. This lecture note discusses the background, current status,\nand future prospects of experimental studies with spin polarized targets and\nradioactive ion beams.\n", "  Methylammonium lead iodide perovskite has revolutionized the field of third\ngeneration solid-state solar cells leading to simple solar cell structures1 and\ncertified efficiencies up to 20.1%. Recently the peculiar light harvesting\nproperties of organometal halide perovskites have been exploited in\nphotodetectors where responsivities of ~3.5 A/W and 180 A/W have been\nrespectively achieved for pure perovskite-based devices and hybrid\nnanostructures. Here, we report on the first hybrid phototransistors where the\nperformance of a network of photoactive Methylammonium Lead Iodide nanowires\n(hereafter MAPbI$_3$NW) are enhanced by CVD-grown monolayer graphene. These\ndevices show responsivities as high as ~2.6x10$^6$ A/W in the visible range\nshowing potential as room-temperature single-electron detector.\n", "  A summary of the latest results released by the CMS Collaboration during the\nSummer of 2016 is presented.\n", "  A global optimization method called Greedy Neighborhood Search (GNS) and a\nnovel conformational sampling method using a spherical distribution is proposed\nto find the minimum energy conformation of a protein-like heteropolymer model\ncalled AB model. The AB model consists of hydrophobic (A) and hydrophilic (B)\nmonomers analogous to the real proteins. The AB model in three-dimensional\nspace is represented by simple bead-rod chain system which is identical to the\none-bead protein model. The minimum energy conformations of four different\nsequences consisting of 13, 21, 34, and 55 monomers are obtained by the GNS\nmethod. The minimum energies found are lower than those obtained by other\nmethods. Also the minimum energy conformations found have a similarity with the\nreal proteins forming a single hydrophobic core.\n", "  The correlation function of radiation from a high-quality semiconductor\nmicrocavity at the resonant laser excitation demonstrates oscillations with\nsurprisingly long-period and damping times of a nanosecond range. It was shown\nthat the oscillations are not attributed to weak Rabi interaction between\nlong-lived exciton states and intracavity electromagnetic field. The study of a\nresponse with high spectral resolution had revealed that the oscillations arise\nif a spectral position as well as a period of longitudinal laser modes is\nsimilar to modulation components of a microcavity transmission spectrum.\n", "  We report an extensive first-principles investigation of impurity-induced\ndevice-to-device variability of spin-polarized quantum tunneling through\nFe/MgO/Fe magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJ). In particular, we calculated the\ntunnel magnetoresistance ratio (TMR) and the average values and variances of\nthe currents and spin transfer torque (STT) of an interfacially doped Fe/MgO/Fe\nMTJ. Further, we predicted that N-doped MgO can improve the performance of a\ndoped Fe/MgO/Fe MTJ. Our first-principles calculations of the fluctuations of\nthe on/off currents and STT provide vital information for future predictions of\nthe long-term reliability of spintronic devices, which is imperative for\nhigh-volume production.\n", "  We investigate the growth factor for sub-horizon modes during late times in\n$f(T,\\mathcal{T})$ gravity, where $T$ is the torsion scalar and $\\mathcal{T}$\nis the trace of the stress-energy tensor. This is achieved by obtaining the\nmodified M\\'{e}sz\\'{a}ros equation, which describes the evolution of the\nperturbations of the matter energy density, and obtaining numerical results.\nSuch results are obtained by solving the modified continuity equation and\nanalysing the behaviour of the solutions of the latter using various\nconstraints on the integration constants. Furthermore, the role of the\nanisotropic term $\\pi^{S}$ is investigated.\n", "  Using error correcting codes and fault tolerant techniques, it is possible,\nat least in theory, to produce logical qubits with significantly lower error\nrates than the underlying physical qubits. Suppose, however, that the gates\nthat act on these logical qubits are only approximation of the desired gate.\nThis can arise, for example, in synthesizing a single qubit unitary from a set\nof Clifford and $T$ gates; for a generic such unitary, any finite sequence of\ngates only approximates the desired target. In this case, errors in the gate\ncan add coherently so that, roughly, the error $\\epsilon$ in the unitary of\neach gate must scale as $\\epsilon \\lesssim 1/N$, where $N$ is the number of\ngates. If, however, one has the option of synthesizing one of several unitaries\nnear the desired target, and if an average of these options is closer to the\ntarget, we give some elementary bounds showing cases in which the errors can be\nmade to add incoherently by averaging over random choices, so that, roughly,\none needs $\\epsilon \\lesssim 1/\\sqrt{N}$. We remark on one particular\napplication to distilling magic states where this effect happens automatically\nin the usual circuits.\n", "  A variety of nonthermal characteristics like kinetic, e.g., temperature,\nanisotropies and suprathermal populations (enhancing the high energy tails of\nthe velocity distributions) are revealed by the in-situ observations in the\nsolar wind indicating quasistationary states of plasma particles out of thermal\nequilibrium. Large deviations from isotropy generate kinetic instabilities and\ngrowing fluctuating fields which should be more efficient than collisions in\nlimiting the anisotropy (below the instability threshold) and explain the\nanisotropy limits reported by the observations. The present paper aims to\ndecode the principal instabilities driven by the temperature anisotropy of\nelectrons and protons in the solar wind, and contrast the instability\nthresholds with the bounds observed at 1~AU for the temperature anisotropy. The\ninstabilities are characterized using linear kinetic theory to identify the\nappropriate (fastest) instability in the relaxation of temperature anisotropies\n$A_{e,p} = T_{e,p,\\perp}/ T_{e,p,\\parallel} \\ne 1$. The analysis focuses on the\nelectromagnetic instabilities driven by the anisotropic protons ($A_p \\lessgtr\n1$) and invokes for the first time a dynamical model to capture the interplay\nwith the anisotropic electrons by correlating the effects of these two species\nof plasma particles, dominant in the solar wind.\n", "  Black TiO2 nanoparticles with a crystalline-core and amorphous-shell\nstructure exhibit superior optoelectronic properties in comparison with\npristine TiO2. The fundamental mechanisms underlying these enhancements,\nhowever, remain unclear, largely due to the inherent complexities and\nlimitations of powder materials. Here, we fabricate TiO2 homojunction films\nconsisting of an oxygen-deficient amorphous layer on top of a highly\ncrystalline layer, to simulate the structural/functional configuration of black\nTiO2 nanoparticles. Metallic conduction is achieved at the\ncrystalline-amorphous homointerface via electronic interface reconstruction,\nwhich we show to be the main reason for the superior properties of black TiO2.\nThis work not only achieves an unprecedented understanding of black TiO2, but\nalso provides a new perspective for investigating carrier generation and\ntransport behavior at oxide interfaces, which are of tremendous fundamental and\ntechnological interest.\n", "  We study the properties of galaxies with very thin discs using a sample of 85\nobjects whose stellar disc radial-to-vertical scale ratio determined from\nphotometric decomposition, exceeds nine. We present evidences of similarities\nbetween the very thin disc galaxies (VTD galaxies) and low surface brightness\n(LSB) disc galaxies, and conclude that both small and giant LSB galaxies may\nreveal themselves as VTD, edge-on galaxies. Our VTD galaxies are mostly\nbulgeless, and those with large radial scale length tend to have redder colors.\nWe performed spectral observations of 22 VTD galaxies with the Dual Imaging\nSpectrograph on the 3.5m telescope at the Apache Point Observatory. The spectra\nwith good resolution (R ~ 5000) allow us to determine the distance and the\nionized gas rotation curve maximum for the galaxies. Our VTD galaxies have low\ndust content, in contrast to regular disc galaxies. Apparently, VTD galaxies\nreside in specific cosmological low-density environments and tend to have less\nconnection with filaments. Comparing a toy model that assumes marginally low\nstar formation in galactic discs with obtained gas kinematics data, we conclude\nthat there is a threshold central surface density of about 88 Mo/pc**2, which\nwe observe in the case of very thin, rotationally supported galactic discs.\n", "  We develop a stochastic parametrization, based on a `simple' deterministic\nmodel for the dynamics of steady longshore currents, that produces ensembles\nthat are statistically consistent with field observations of these currents.\nUnlike deterministic models, stochastic parameterization incorporates\nrandomness and hence can only match the observations in a statistical sense.\nUnlike statistical emulators, in which the model is tuned to the statistical\nstructure of the observation, stochastic parametrization are not directly tuned\nto match the statistics of the observations. Rather, stochastic\nparameterization combines deterministic, i.e physics based models with\nstochastic models for the \"missing physics\" to create hybrid models, that are\nstochastic, but yet can be used for making predictions, especially in the\ncontext of data assimilation. We introduce a novel measure of the utility of\nstochastic models of complex processes, that we call {\\em consistency of\nsensitivity}. We show, in the context of data assimilation, the stochastic\nparametrization of longshore currents achieves good results in capturing the\nstatistics of observation {\\em that were not used} in tuning the model.\n", "  The Chua's circuit is a paradigm for nonlinear scientific studies. It is\nusually simulated by means of numerical methods under IEEE 754-2008 standard.\nAlthough the error propagation problem is well known, little attention has been\ngiven to the relationship between this error and inequalities presented in\nChua's circuit model. Taking the average of round mode towards $+\\infty$ and\n$-\\infty$, we showed a qualitative change on the dynamics of Chua's circuit.\n", "  Electrically defined semiconductor quantum dots are attractive systems for\nspin manipulation and quantum information processing. Heavy-holes in both Si\nand GaAs are promising candidates for all-electrical spin manipulation, owing\nto the weak hyperfine interaction and strong spin-orbit interaction. However,\nit has only recently become possible to make stable quantum dots in these\nsystems, mainly due to difficulties in device fabrication and stability. Here\nwe present electrical transport measurements on holes in a gate-defined double\nquantum dot in a $\\mathrm{GaAs/Al_xGa_{1-x}As}$ heterostructure. We observe\nclear Pauli spin blockade and demonstrate that the lifting of this spin\nblockade by an external magnetic field is highly anisotropic. Numerical\ncalculations of heavy-hole transport through a double quantum dot in the\npresence of strong spin-orbit coupling show quantitative agreement with\nexperimental results and suggest that the observed anisotropy can be explained\nby both the anisotropic effective hole g-factor and the surface Dresselhaus\nspin-orbit interaction.\n", "  We revisit a non-perturbation theory of quantum gravity in $1.5$ order\nunderlying an emergent gravitational pair of $(4{\\bar 4})$-brane with a renewed\ninterest. In particular the formulation is governed by a geometric torsion\n${\\cal H}_3$ in second order with an on-shell NS form in first order.\nInterestingly the gravitational pair is sourced by a Kalb-Ramond two form CFT\non a $D_5$-brane in $d$$=$$10$ type IIB superstring theory. We show that a\ngeneric form theory containing a CFT sector in $d=6$ bulk may be described by a\nboundary ${\\rm AdS}_5$ with a quintessence Q. Analysis reveals that the\nbulk/boundary duality in emergent gravity can be a potential tool to explore\nthe quintessential cosmology.\n", "  Modeling the charge-generation process is highly important to understand\ndevice physics and optimize power conversion efficiency of bulk-heterojunction\n(BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs). Free carriers are generated by both ultrafast\nexciton delocalization and slow exciton diffusion and dissociation at the\nheterojunction interface. In this work, we developed a systematic numerical\nsimulation to describe the charge-generation process by a modified\ndrift-diffusion model. The transport, recombination, and collection of free\ncarriers are incorporated to fully capture the device response. The theoretical\nresults match well with the state-of-the-art high-performance organic solar\ncells. It is demonstrated that the increase of exciton delocalization ratio\nreduces the energy loss in the exciton diffusion-dissociation process, and\nthus, significantly improves the device efficiency especially for the\nshort-circuit current. By changing the exciton delocalization ratio, OSC\nperformances are comprehensively investigated under the conditions of\nshort-circuit and open-circuit. Particularly, bulk recombination dependent fill\nfactor saturation is unveiled and understood. As a fundamental electrical\nanalysis of the delocalization mechanism, our work is important to understand\nand optimize the high-performance OSCs.\n", "  This article reviews the properties and limitations associated with the\nexistence of particle, visual, and event horizons in cosmology in general and\nin inflationary universes in particular, carefully distinguishing them from\n`Hubble horizons'. It explores to what extent one might be able to probe\nconditions beyond the visual horizon (which is close in size to the present\nHubble radius), thereby showing that visual horizons place major limits on what\nare observationally testable aspects of a multiverse, if such exists. Indeed\nthese limits largely prevent us from observationally proving a multiverse\neither does or does not exist. We emphasize that event horizons play no role at\nall in observational cosmology, even in the multiverse context, despite some\nclaims to the contrary in the literature.\n", "  We study the dynamical properties of a particle in a non-planar square\nbilliard. The plane of the billiard has a sinusoidal shape. We consider both\nthe static and time-dependent plane. We study the affect of different\nparameters that control the geometry of the billiard in this model. We consider\nvariations of different parameters of the model and describe how the particle\ntrajectory is affected by these parameters. We also investigate the dynamical\nbehavior of the system in the static condition using its reduced phase plot and\nshow that the dynamics of the particle inside the billiard may be regular,\nmixed or chaotic. Finally, the problem of the particle energy growth is studied\nin the billiard with the time-dependent plane. We show that when in the static\ncase, the billiard is chaotic, then the particle energy in the time-dependent\nbilliard grows for small number of collisions, and then it starts to saturate.\nBut when the dynamics of the static case is regular, then the particle average\nenergy in the time-dependent situation stays constant.\n", "  The dynamics of dilute micron-sized spherical inertial particles in turbulent\nduct flows is studied by means of direct numerical simulations of the carrier\nphase turbulence with one-way coupled Lagrangian particles. The geometries are\na square and a rectangular duct with width-to-height aspect ratio $AR$ of 3\noperating at $Re_{\\tau,c}=360$ . The present study is designed to determine the\neffect of turbulence-driven secondary motion on the particle dynamics. Our\nresults show that a weak cross-flow secondary motion significantly changes the\ncross-sectional map of the particle concentration, mean velocity and\nfluctuations. As the geometry of the duct is widened from $AR=1$ to 3, the\nsecondary vortex on the horizontal wall significantly expands in the spanwise\ndirection, and although the kinetic energy of the secondary flow increases\nclose to the corner, it decays towards the duct centreplane in the $AR=3$ case\nso as the turbulent carrier phase approaches the behavior in spanwise-periodic\nchannel flows, a fact that significantly affects the particle statistics. In\nthe square duct the particle concentration in the viscous sublayer is maximum\nat the duct centreplane, whereas the maximum is found closer to the corner, at\na distance of $|z/h|\\approx1.25$ from the centreplane, in the $AR=3$ case.\nInterestingly the centreplane concentration in the rectangular duct is around 3\ntimes lower than that in the square duct. Moreover, a second peak in the\naccumulation distribution is found right at the corners for both ducts. At this\nlocation the concentration increases with particle inertia. The secondary\nmotion changes also the cross-stream map of the particle velocities\nsignificantly in comparison to the fluid flow statistics. These directly affect\nthe particle velocity fluctuations such that multiple peaks appear near the\nduct walls for the particle streamwise and wall-normal velocity fluctuations.\n", "  The Meridional Overturning Circulation (MOC) in the Southern Ocean is\ninvestigated using hydrographic observations combined with satellite\nobservations of sea-surface height. A three-dimensional (spatial and vertical)\nestimate of the isopycnal eddy-diffusivity in the Southern Ocean is obtained\nusing the theory of Ferrari & Nikurashin (2010), that includes the influence of\nsuppression of the diffusivity by the strong, time-mean flows. It is found that\nthe eddy diffusivity is enhanced at depth, reaching a maximum at the \"critical\nlayer\" near 1000m. The estimate of diffusivity is used with a simple diffusive\nparameterization to estimate the meridional eddy volume flux. Together with an\nestimate of the meridional Ekman transport and the time-mean meridional\ngeostrophic transport, the eddy volume flux is used to reconstruct the\ntime-mean overturning circulation. By comparing the reconstruction with, and\nwithout, suppression of the eddy diffusivity by the mean flow, the influence of\nthe suppression on the overturning is illuminated. It is shown that the\nsuppression of the eddy diffusivity results in a large reduction of interior\neddy transports, and a more realistic eddy induced overturning circulation.\nFinally, a simple conceptual model is used to show that the MOC is influenced\nnot only by the existence of enhanced diffusivity at depth, but also by the\ndetails of the vertical structure of the eddy diffusivity, such as the depth of\nthe critical layer.\n", "  The hitherto unexplored nonlocality of quantum correlations in the\ninformation transfer protocol of remote state preparation (RSP) is investigated\nin terms of a unified nonlocality argument formulated for teleportation as well\nas for two distinct RSP schemes. The argument differs only in the respective\ntypes of local measurements used in each scenario. One of the RSP schemes uses\nsingle particle projective measurements, while the other uses joint Bell-basis\nmeasurements. Interestingly, the quantum mechanical violations of the Bell-CHSH\ntype inequalities formulated for each of the RSP setups, while being equal to\neach other, also turn out to be equal to that of the corresponding Bell-CHSH\ntype local realist inequality for teleportation, using the common resource of\nnon-maximally entangled state. This reveals that for such a resource state, the\nmaximum amount of extractable nonlocality of correlations involved in the\ntransfer of information is the same for the standard teleportation protocol and\nthe two RSP schemes considered here, thereby implying that the essential\ndifference between teleportation and remote state preparation lies in the\namount of classical information required to be exchanged between parties, and\nnot in the nonlocality of underlying correlations.\n", "  We investigate the unusual properties of quasirelativistic massless fermions\nunder a magnetic or electric field by means of nonminimal couplings. Within\nthis approach, the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) effects are properly generated in\nthe energy spectrum of the quasiparticles. By including a magnetic field, $B$,\nwe show that the spin splitting of Landau Levels (LL) obeys a $\\sqrt{B}$ linear\ndependence with SOC, typical of relativistic particles. Moreover, our\ncalculated spectrum of LLs resembles the behavior of the three-dimensional (3D)\nmassless Kane fermions. Using a nonminimal coupling with an external electric\nfield, we demonstrate that a Rashba-like SOC naturally appears into the\nrelativistic equations and apply to the case of two-dimensional (2D) massless\nDirac fermions. Still considering our proposed approach, the Hall conductivity\nis also computed for the 2D case under transverse electric field both at zero\nand finite temperatures for a general chemical potential. The results feature a\ntypical quantization of the Hall conductivity at low temperatures, when the\nabsolute value of the gap opened by the electric field is larger than the\nconsidered chemical potential.\n", "  In the present thesis, using an effective field theory point of view, we\nexplore theories of single-field inflation where higher derivative operators\nbecome relevant, affecting in a novel way the dynamics and therefore the\nobservations. For instance, concerning the scalar spectrum, they allow for\nmeasurable equilateral non-Gaussianity, whose amplitude can differ\nsignificantly from the predictions of other existing models. Moreover, we show\nthat the stability and the consistency of such theories are ensured by an\napproximate Galileon symmetry. Indeed, being generically possible to build an\ninvariant theory under Galileon transformations in flat space-time, it is\ninstead well known that such a symmetry is unavoidably broken by gravity. In\nprinciple, this might ruin the nice and interesting properties of the Galileons\nin flat backgrounds, such as the non-renormalization theorem. However, we find\nthat this does not happen if the Galileon invariance is broken only weakly, in\na well defined sense, by a suitable coupling to gravity, providing therefore an\nextension of the quantum non-renormalization properties in curved space-times.\nHence, besides discussing the phenomenological consequences and the\nobservational predictions for inflation, we apply such Galileon theories to the\ncontext of the late-time acceleration of the Universe. In the last part, in\norder to probe non-standard primordial scenarios, they are also employed in a\ncosmology where the Big Bang singularity is smoothed down and the Universe\nemerges from a Minkowski space-time, in a well defined extension at all times\nof the Galilean Genesis scenario.\n", "  We briefly report on a recent computation, with the help of a fruitful\nalgebraic model, sketching the pion valence dressed-quark generalized parton\ndistribution. Then, preliminary, we introduce on a sensible procedure to get\nreliable results in both Dokshitzer-Gribov-Lipatov-Altarelli-Parisi (DGLAP) and\nEfremov-Radyushkin-Brodsky-Lepage (ERBL) kinematical regions, grounded on the\nGPD overlap representation and its parametrization of a Radon transform of the\nso-called double distribution (DD).\n", "  We present UV-extended E-MILES stellar population synthesis models covering\nthe spectral range 1680-50000A at moderately high resolution. We employ the\nNGSL space-based stellar library to compute spectra of single-age,\nsingle-metallicity stellar populations in the wavelength range from 1680 to\n3540A. These models represent a significant improvement in resolution and\nage/metallicity coverage over previous studies based on earlier space-based\nlibraries. These model spectra were joined with those we computed in the\nvisible using MILES, and other empirical libraries for redder wavelengths. The\nmodels span the metallicity range -1.79<[M/H]<+0.26 and ages above 30 Myr, for\na suite of IMF types with varying slopes. We focus on the behaviour of colours,\nspectra and line-strength indices in the UV range as a function of relevant\nstellar population parameters. Whereas some indices strengthen with increasing\nage and metallicity, as most metallicity indicators in the visible, other\nindices peak around 3 Gyr for metal-rich stellar populations, such as Mg at\n2800A. Our models provide reasonably good fits to the integrated colours and\nmost line-strengths of the stellar clusters of the Milky-Way and LMC. Our\nfull-spectrum fits in the UV range for a representative set of ETGs of varying\nmass yield age and metallicity estimates in very good agreement with those\nobtained in the optical range. The comparison of UV colours and line-strengths\nof massive ETGs with our models reveals the presence of young stellar\ncomponents, with ages in the range 0.1-0.5 Gyr and mass fractions 0.1-0.5%, on\nthe top of an old stellar population.\n", "  We will present results of studies of several massive stars at different\nevolutionary stages, but with similar values of the initial mass: O-supergiants\nbelonging to association Cyg OB2, unique LBV/post-LBV - Romano's star and two\nWolf-Rayet stars - WR156 and FSZ35. All these stars have similar initial mass\nof about 50 Msun. It allows us to consider them a single star at different\nmoments of life, and it gives an opportunity to track changes in the physical\nparameters (such as effective temperature, luminosity, mass loss rate, wind\nvelocity) and chemical abundances during the life of a massive star. It is\nimportant to test the current evolution theories of such objects.\n", "  The long range potential of helium-helium interaction, which requires\naccurate 'ab initio' calculation, due to the small value of the potential\ndepth, approximately 11 K (0.091 kJ/mol) at 2.96 angstrom, will be obtained in\nthis study by an alternative technique. This work presents a robust and\nconsistent procedure that provides the long range potential directly from\nexperimental data. However, it is difficult to obtain experimental data\ncontaining information regarding such a small potential depth. Thereby,\nsensitivity analysis will be used to circumvent this difficulty, from which\nviscosity data at lower temperatures (<5K) were chosen as appropriate data to\nbe used to retrieve the potential function between 3 and 4 angstrom. The linear\nrelationship between the potential energy function and the viscosity\ncoefficient will be established under quantum assumptions and the Bose-Einstein\nstatistic. The use of quantum theory is essential, since the temperatures are\nbelow 5K. The potential obtained in this study describes the viscosity with an\naverage error of 1.68% that is less than the experimental error (5%), with the\nresults being similar to those obtained for recent 'ab initio' potentials.\n", "  To explain the nature of the anomalously high reddening (Av~10 mag) towards\none of the most luminous stars in the Galaxy - Cyg OB2 #12 (B5 Ia-0), also\nknown as MT304, we carried out spectro-photometric observations of 24 stars\nlocated in its vicinity. We included five new B-stars to the members of Cygnus\nOB2, and for five more photometrically selected stars we spectroscopically\nconfirmed their membership. We constructed the map of interstellar extinction\nwithin 2.5 arcmin radius and found that interstellar extinction increases\ntowards MT304. The increase of reddening suggests that the reddening excess may\nbe caused by the circumstellar shell ejected by the star during its evolution.\nWe also report the detection of a second component of MT304, and discovery of\nan even fainter third component, based on data of speckle interferometric\nobservations taken with the Russian 6-m telescope.\n", "  In the last decade, progress on quantization of homogeneous cosmological\nspacetimes using techniques of loop quantum gravity has led to insights on\nvarious fundamental questions and has opened new avenues to explore Planck\nscale physics. These include the problem of singularities and their possible\ngeneric resolution, constructing viable non-singular models of the very early\nuniverse, and bridging quantum gravity with cosmological observations. These\nresults, which emerge from an interplay of sophisticated analytical and\nnumerical techniques, has also led to valuable hints on loop quantization of\nblack hole and inhomogeneous spacetimes. In this review, we provide a summary\nof this progress while focusing on concrete examples of the quantization\nprocedure and phenomenology of cosmological perturbations.\n", "  We generalize a microscopic master equation method to study the dissipation\ndynamics of Jaynes-Cummings two-level system with a weak external driving.\nUsing perturbative analysis to extend the damping bases theory, we derive the\ncorrected Rabi oscillation and vaccum Rabi splitting analytically. The\nevolution of the decoherence factor of the weakly driven system reveals that\nthe off-diagonal density matrix elements are oscillating at a frequency\ndependent on the driving strength and the initial population inversion. For\nhighly-inverted systems at the weak-driving limit, this frequency reduces to\ntwice the value for the non-driven system, showing the dissipation dynamics\nunable to be discovered using more conventional approaches.\n", "  Backward stimulated Raman scattering (BSRS) with Langmuir decay instability\n(LDI) and Langmuir collapse has been researched by Vlasov simulation for the\nfirst time. The decay productions of LDI cascade and their evolution with time\nis clearly demonstrated, which occurs simultaneously with Langmuir collapse.\nThe BSRS reflectivity will be decreased largely through LDI cascade and\nLangmuir collapse. In CH plasmas, when $T_i/T_e=1/3$, the Landau damping of the\nslow ion-acoustic wave (IAW) is lower than that in H plasmas. Therefore, the\nBSRS can be further suppressed through LDI cascade by the way of controlling\nthe species of plasmas and ions ratio. These results give an effective\nmechanism to suppress the BSRS and hot electrons generation.\n", "  We analyze antiferromagnetism in $f$ electron superlattices. We show that the\ncompetition between the Kondo effect and the RKKY interaction in $f$ electron\nmaterials is modified by the superlattice structure. Thus, the quantum critical\npoint which separates the magnetic phase and the Fermi liquid phase depends on\nthe structure of the $f$ electron superlattice. The competition between the\nKondo effect and the RKKY interaction is also reflected in the magnetic\ninterlayer coupling between different $f$ electron layers. We demonstrate that\nin the case of weak Kondo effect the magnetic interlayer coupling behaves\nsimilar to other magnetic heterostructures without Kondo effect. However, close\nto the quantum phase transition, the dependence of the interlayer coupling on\nthe distance between the $f$ electron layers is modified by the Kondo effect.\nAnother remarkable effect, which is characteristic for $f$ electron\nsuperlattice, is that the magnetic interlayer coupling does vanish stepwise\ndepending on the distance between different $f$ electron layers. As a\nconsequence, the quantum critical point depends also stepwise on this distance.\n", "  Systems with coupled cavities and waveguides have been demonstrated as\noptical switches and optical sensors. To optimize the functionalities of these\noptical devices, Fano resonance with asymmetric and steep spectral line shape\nhas been used. We theoretically propose a coupled photonic crystal\ncavity-waveguide structure to achieve Fano resonance by placing partially\nreflecting elements in waveguide. To enhance Fano resonance, optical gain\nmaterial is introduced into the cavity. As the gain increases, the transmission\nline shape becomes steepened and the transmissivity can be six times enhanced,\ngiving a large contrast by a small frequency shift. It is prospected that the\ngain enhanced Fano resonance is very useful for optical switches and optical\nsensors.\n", "  The ATLAS experiment will undergo a major upgrade of the tracker system in\nview of the high luminosity phase of the LHC (HL-LHC) to start operation in\n2026. The most severe challenges are to be faced by the innermost layers of the\npixel detector which will have to withstand a radiation fluence of up to\n$1.4\\times10^{16}\\,$n$_\\text{eq}$/cm$^{2}$. Thin planar pixel modules are\npromising candidates to instrument these layers, thanks to the small material\nbudget and their high charge collection efficiency after irradiation. Sensors\nof $100-200\\,\\mu$m thickness, interconnected to FE-I4 read-out chips, are\ncharacterized with radioactive sources as well as testbeams at the CERN-SPS and\nDESY. The performance of sensors irradiated up to a fluence of $5\\times\n10^{15}\\,$n$_\\text{eq}$/cm$^{2}$ is compared in terms of charge collection and\nhit efficiency. Highly segmented sensors are a challenge for the tracking in\nthe forward region of the pixel system at the HL-LHC. To reproduce the\nperformance of $50$x$50\\,\\mu$m$^2$ pixels at high pseudo-rapidities, FE-I4\ncompatible planar pixel sensors are studied before and after irradiation in\nbeam tests at high incidence angle ($80^\\circ$) with respect to the short pixel\ndirection. Results on cluster shape and hit efficiency will be shown.\n", "  We demonstrate a facile and scalable technique, rotational freezing, to\nproduce porous tubular ceramic supports with radially aligned porosity. The\nmethod is based on a conventional ice-templating process in a rotatory mold and\ndemonstrated here with yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ). We investigated the\neffects of solid loading, freezing temperature, and volume of the slurry on the\nmicrostructure, strength (o-ring test and four-point bending), and air\npermeability. The results show that pore volume and pore size can be controlled\nby the solid loading and freezing temperature respectively, and overall tube\nthickness can be adjusted by the volume of slurry initially poured into the\nmold. Decreasing pore size and pore volume increases the mechanical properties\nbut decreases the air permeability. These tubes could be particularly\ninteresting as tubular membrane supports such as oxygen transport membranes.\n", "  Studies of the boosted sector in top-quark physics have known a fast-growing\ndevelopment with the arrival of high-energy data at LHC. This short review\nsummarizes the current status of the boosted top-tagging techniques in ATLAS\nand CMS and presents an overview of some of the most noticeable developments.\n", "  The genesis of the Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics (Albert\nEinstein Institute) after German re-unification as described here, shows that\nthe history of the founding of the institute is not as simplistic as claimed\ne.g., in the presentation by the institute.Quite a few people and institutions\nhave been involved.The institute now seems to be one of the largest institution\nfor research in gravity, worldwide.\n", "  This article introduces Kerson Huang's theory on superfluid universe in these\naspects: I. choose the asymptotically free Halpern-Huang scalar field(s) to\ndrive inflation; II. use quantum turbulence to create matter; III. consider\ndark energy as the energy density of the cosmic superfluid and dark matter the\ndeviation of the superfluid density from its equilibrium value; IV. use quantum\nvorticity to explain phenomena such as the non-thermal filaments at the\ngalactic center, the large voids in the galactic distribution, and the\ngravitational collapse of stars to fast-rotating blackholes.\n", "  One of the goals of the Pulkovo program of research on stars with large\nproper motions is to reveal among the low-luminosity stars those that have\nevidence of binarity. Twelve astrometric binary candidates from the Pulkovo\nlist have been included in the program of speckle observations with the BTA\ntelescope at the Special Astrophysical Observatory of the Russian Academy of\nSciences (SAO RAS) and the 2.5-m telescope at the Caucasus Mountain Observatory\n(CMO) of the Sternberg Astronomical Institute of the Moscow State University to\nconfirm their binarity and then to determine the parameters of the revealed\nstellar pairs. The binarity of the brightest of these stars, J1158+4239 (GJ\n3697), has been confirmed. Four sessions of speckle observations with the BTA\nSAO RAS telescope and one session with the 2.5-m CMO telescope have been\ncarried out in 2015 - 2016. The weighted mean estimates of the pair parameters\nare $\\rho$=286.5$\\pm$1.2 mas and $\\theta$=230.24$\\pm$0.16$^{\\circ}$ at the\nepoch B2015.88248. The magnitude difference between the pair stars is $\\Delta\nm$=0.55$\\pm$0.03 (a filter with a central wavelength of 800 nm and a FWHM of\n100 nm) and $\\Delta m$=0.9$\\pm$0.1 (an R filter).\n", "  We theoretically investigate Sn(II) phosphates as optoelectronic materials\nusing first principles calculations. We focus on known prototype materials\nSn$_n$P$_2$O$_{5+n}$ (n=2, 3, 4, 5) and a previously unreported compound,\nSnP$_2$O$_6$ (n=1), which we find using global optimization structure\nprediction. The electronic structure calculations indicate that these compounds\nall have large band gaps above 3.2 eV, meaning their transparency to visible\nlight. Several of these compounds show relatively low hole effective masses\n($\\sim$2-3 m$_0$), comparable the electron masses. This suggests potential\nbipolar conductivity depending on doping. The dispersive valence band-edges\nunderlying the low hole masses, originate from the anti-bonding hybridization\nbetween the Sn 5s orbitals and the phosphate groups. Analysis of\nstructure-property relationships for the metastable structures generated during\nstructure search shows considerable variation in combinations of band gap and\ncarrier effective masses, implying chemical tunability of these properties. The\nunusual combinations of relatively high band gap, low carrier masses and high\nchemical stability suggests possible optoelectronic applications of these\nSn(II) phosphates, including p-type transparent conductors. Related to this,\ncalculations for doped material indicate low visible light absorption, combined\nwith high plasma frequencies.\n", "  In Afghanistan, High school graduates, to continue higher education, need to\npass the National University Entrance Exam (Kankor). Kankor is very important\nand requires further research as it is used as the only means to identify the\nparticipant's competence and skills which leads to a qualified higher education\nand manpower, employment opportunities, allocation of human capital in\nappropriate fields of study, and leading to a more specialized labor force in\nthe long run.\n  Having a better picture of Kankor in Afghanistan is essential before\nemploying educational data mining techniques and other social and pedagogical\napproaches to support the students and the educational institutions. Hence, the\nauthor carried out a research on Kankor, in which he assessed and analyzed\nKankor from different angles. This research paper provides positive\ncontribution to the Ministry of Higher Education (MoHE), particularly, the\nKankor committee, and other educational institutions - introducing the\nimportance of data as an asset and a proper structure of recording and\nproducing data effective for research studies, paving the way for in-depth\ndescriptive and predictive analytics which improves the situation within the\ncontext of the existing structural models in Afghanistan.\n  The author's research target is to study Kankor using descriptive analytics\nsupported by Kankor Results Data (KRD) of 1.5 million records from 2003-2015,\nDetailed Kankor Results Data which is a subset of KRD from 2004-2006 of 120,000\nrecords, High school performance and grades data from 2011-2013 of 6,000\nrecords, data collected through conducting more than 2500 questionnaires among\nacademicians as well as the author's personal observations, findings, and\nanalyses as a student and faculty member at the University in the field of\ncomputer science.\n", "  By means of Density Functional Theory calculations we evaluate several\nlithium carbonate - graphite interface models as a prototype of the Solid\nElectrolyte Interphase capping layer on graphite anodes in lithium-ion\nbatteries. It is found that only an (a,b)-oriented Li2CO3 slab promotes tight\nbinding with graphite. Such mutual organization of the components combines\ntheir structural features and reproduces coordination environment of ions,\nresulting in an adhesive energy of 116 meV/{\\AA}2 between graphite and lithium\ncarbonate. This model also presents a high potential affinity with bulk. The\ncorresponding charge distribution at such interface induces an electric\npotential gradient, such a gradient having been experimentally observed. We\nregard the mentioned criteria as the key descriptors of the interface stability\nand recommend them as the principal assessments for such interface study. In\naddition, we evaluate the impact of lithiated graphite on the stability of the\nmodel interface and study the generation of different point defects as\nmediators for Li interface transport. It is found that Li diffusion is mainly\nprovided by interstitials. The induced potential gradient fundamentally assists\nthe intercalation up to lithiation ratio of 70%.\n", "  An expression is derived which links the probability of photon reabsorption\n(recycling) in a material with other optical parameters. We discuss the\napplication of this relation in several typical situations which are relevant\nin the operation of devices such as solar cells and light-emitting diodes.\n", "  Epidemic models are increasingly used in real-world networks to understand\ndiffusion phenomena (such as the spread of diseases, emotions, innovations,\nfailures) or the transport of information (such as news, memes in social\non-line networks). A new analysis of the prevalence, the expected number of\ninfected nodes in a network, is presented and physically interpreted. The\nanalysis method is based on spectral decomposition and leads to a universal,\nanalytic curve, that can bound the time-varying prevalence in any finite time\ninterval. Moreover, that universal curve also applies to various types of\nSusceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) (and Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR))\ninfection processes, with both homogenous and heterogeneous infection\ncharacteristics (curing and infection rates), in temporal and even disconnected\ngraphs and in SIS processes with and without self-infections. The accuracy of\nthe universal curve is comparable to that of well-established mean-field\napproximations.\n", "  The HOMO-LUMO gaps of the bilayer fullerene onions were investigated. For\nthis purpose, the HOMO and LUMO energies were calculated for the isolated\nfullerenes using the parametrization of the tight binding method with the\nHarrison-Goodwin modification. Next, the difference of the Fermi levels of the\nouter and inner shell was calculated by considering the hybridization of the\norbitals on the base of the geometric parameters. The results were obtained by\nthe combination of these calculations.\n", "  The carbon nanostructures are perspective materials for the future\napplications. This has two reasons: first, the hexagonal atomic structure which\nenables a high molecular variability by placing different kinds of the defects\nand second, good electronic properties which can be modified for the purpose of\nthe concrete applications with the help of the defects and of the chemical\ningredients. A lot of kinds of the nanostructures was investigated. Here, the\nproperties of less common forms will be examined - the graphitic nanocone and\ngraphitic wormhole.\n", "  In this paper the method of the relativistically-invariant effective tensor\nrepresentation of Lagrangian decomposition and the amplitudes of the two-photon\ninteraction with hadrons on photon energy is proposed. In the frames\nDuffin-Kemmer-Petiau formalism based on this method the spin polarizabilities\nof the spin 1 particles, which are characteristic for the spin 1/2 hadrons were\nestablished. Also the authors have obtained the new spin polarizabilities which\nare characteristic for spin 1 particles and are bounded with the presence of\nthe tensor polarizabilities of these particles. It was shown that in the\nsuggested covariant approach with regard to the crossing symmetry, the spatial\nparity, conservation laws and gauge invariance definite spin polarizabilities\nand gyrations of spin-1 particles contribute to the expansion of Compton\nscattering amplitude, starting from the corresponding orders on photon energy\nthat is in the agreement with low-energy theorems for that process.\n", "  We present an investigation of pion structure based on ETMC $N_f=2$ and\n$N_f=2+1+1$ twisted mass configurations at maximal twist. We compute the first\nmoment of the quark momentum fraction of the pion, $\\langle x \\rangle$ and the\nelectromagnetic form factor, $F_\\pi(Q^2)$. For the latter, momentum is injected\nusing twisted boundary conditions and the calculation is carried out directly\nat the physical pion mass. We find that our data are consistent with vector\nmeson dominance and experimental data in the region of small momentum transfer.\nFor $\\langle x \\rangle$, we find that our chirally and continuum extrapolated\nresult is compatible with its phenomenological value.\n", "  Human creativity is the ultimate driving force behind scientific progress.\nWhile the building blocks of innovations are often embodied in existing\nknowledge, it is creativity that blends seemingly disparate ideas. Existing\nstudies have made striding advances in quantifying creativity of scientific\npublications by investigating their citation relationships. Yet, little is\nknown hitherto about the underlying mechanisms governing scientific creative\nprocesses, largely due to that a paper's references, at best, only partially\nreflect its authors' actual information consumption. This work represents an\ninitial step towards fine-grained understanding of creative processes in\nscientific enterprise. In specific, using two web-scale longitudinal datasets\n(120.1 million papers and 53.5 billion web requests spanning 4 years), we\ndirectly contrast authors' information consumption behaviors against their\nknowledge products. We find that, of 59.0\\% papers across all scientific\nfields, 25.7\\% of their creativity can be readily explained by information\nconsumed by their authors. Further, by leveraging these findings, we develop a\npredictive framework that accurately identifies the most critical knowledge to\nfostering target scientific innovations. We believe that our framework is of\nfundamental importance to the study of scientific creativity. It promotes\nstrategies to stimulate and potentially automate creative processes, and\nprovides insights towards more effective designs of information recommendation\nplatforms.\n", "  We explore the localization of compact binary coalescences with ground-based\ngravitational-wave detector networks. We simulate tens of thousands of binary\nevents, and present the distributions of localization sky areas and\nlocalization volumes for a range of sources and network configurations. We show\nthat generically there exists a tail of particularly well-localized events,\nwith 2D and 3D localizations of $<10\\,\\mbox{deg}^2$ and $<1000\\,\\mbox{Mpc}^3$\nachievable, respectively, starting in LIGO/Virgo's third observing run.\nIncorporating estimates for the galaxy density and the binary event rates, we\nargue that future gravitational-wave detector networks will localize a small\nnumber of binary systems per year to a sufficiently small volume that the\nunique host galaxy might be identified. For these golden events, which are\ngenerally the closest and loudest ones, the gravitational-wave detector\nnetworks will point (in 3D; the length of the finger matters) directly at the\nsource. This will allow for studies of the properties of the host galaxies of\ncompact binary mergers, which may be an important component in exploring the\nformation channels of these sources. In addition, since the host will provide\nan independent measurement of the redshift, this will allow the use of the\nevent as a standard siren to measure cosmology. Furthermore, identification of\na small number of host galaxies can enable deep follow-up searches for\nassociated electromagnetic transients.\n", "  I discuss the near-degeneracy between models of neutrino-nucleus interactions\nbased on diverse assumptions, and analyze a specific example illustrating how\nthe different reaction mechanisms taken into account, as well as the\napproximations associated with their implementation, may conspire to make the\nprediction of two models look similar. I argue that the relevant reaction\nmechanisms may be unambiguously identified exploiting the availability of\nelectron-nucleus scattering data other than inclusive cross sections, providing\ndetailed information on the nuclear spectral function.\n", "  We introduce a novel algorithm of community detection that maintains\ndynamically a community structure of a large network that evolves with time.\nThe algorithm maximizes the modularity index thanks to the construction of a\nrandomized hierarchical clustering based on a Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC)\nmethod. Interestingly, it could be seen as a dynamization of Louvain algorithm\n(see Blondel et Al, 2008) where the aggregation step is replaced by the\nhierarchical instrumental probability.\n", "  A ground-based neutron monitor is a standard tool to measure cosmic ray\nvariability near Earth, and it is crucially important to know its yield\nfunction for primary cosmic rays. Although there are several earlier\ntheoretically calculated yield functions, none of them agrees with experimental\ndata of latitude surveys of sea-level neutron monitors, thus suggesting for an\ninconsistency. A newly computed yield function of the standard sea-level 6NM64\nneutron monitor is presented here separately for primary cosmic ray protons and\n$\\alpha-$particles, the latter representing also heavier species of cosmic\nrays. The computations have been done using the GEANT-4 Planetocosmics\nMonte-Carlo tool and a realistic curved atmospheric model. For the first time,\nan effect of the geometrical correction of the neutron monitor effective area,\nrelated to the finite lateral expansion of the cosmic ray induced atmospheric\ncascade, is considered, that was neglected in the previous studies. This\ncorrection slightly enhances the relative impact of higher-energy cosmic rays\n(energy above 5--10 GeV/nucleon) in neutron monitor count rate. The new\ncomputation finally resolves the long-standing problem of disagreement between\nthe theoretically calculated spatial variability of cosmic rays over the globe\nand experimental latitude surveys. The newly calculated yield function,\ncorrected for this geometrical factor, appears fully consistent with the\nexperimental latitude surveys of neutron monitors performed during three\nconsecutive solar minima in 1976--77, 1986--87 and 1996--97. Thus, we provide a\nnew yield function of the standard sea-level neutron monitor 6NM64 that is\nvalidated against experimental data.\n", "  A brief review is presented of the scaling of complex fluids, polymers and\npolyelectrolytes in solution and in confined geometry, in thermodynamical,\nstructural and rheology properties using equilibrium and nonequilibrium\ndissipative particle dynamics simulations. All simulations were carried out on\nhigh performance computational facilities using parallelized algorithms, solved\non computers using both central and graphical processing units. The scaling\napproach is shown to be a unifying axis around which general trends and basic\nknowledge can be gained, illustrated through a series of case studies.\n", "  Knots and links are fascinating and intricate topological objects. Their\ninfluence spans from DNA and molecular chemistry to vortices in superfluid\nhelium, defects in liquid crystals and cosmic strings in the early universe.\nHere, we find that knotted structures also exist in a peculiar class of\nthree-dimensional topological insulators---the Hopf insulators. In particular,\nwe demonstrate that the momentum-space spin textures of Hopf insulators are\ntwisted in a nontrivial way, which implies the presence of various knot and\nlink structures. We further illustrate that the knots and nontrivial spin\ntextures can be probed via standard time-of-flight images in cold atoms as\npreimage contours of spin orientations in stereographic coordinates. The\nextracted Hopf invariants, knots, and links are validated to be robust to\ntypical experimental imperfections. Our work establishes the existence of\nknotted structures in Hopf insulators, which may have potential applications in\nspintronics and quantum information processing.\n"]}
