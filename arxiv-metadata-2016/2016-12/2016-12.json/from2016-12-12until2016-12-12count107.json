The quantum analogue of the replicator\ndynamics is the von Neumann equation. Quantum mechanics could be used to\nexplain more correctly biological and economical processes. It could even\nencloses theories like games and evolutionary dynamics. We can take some\nconcepts and definitions from quantum mechanics and physics for the best\nunderstanding of the behavior of economics and biology. Also, we could maybe\nunderstand nature like a game in where its players compete for a common welfare\nand the equilibrium of the system that they are members. All the members of our\nsystem will play a game in which its maximum payoff is the equilibrium of the\nsystem. They act as a whole besides individuals like they obey a rule in where\nthey prefer to work for the welfare of the collective besides the individual\nwelfare. A system where its members are in Nash Equilibrium (or ESS) is exactly\nequivalent to a system in a maximum entropy state. A system is stable only if\nit maximizes the welfare of the collective above the welfare of the individual.\nIf it is maximized the welfare of the individual above the welfare of the\ncollective the system gets unstable an eventually collapses. The results of\nthis work shows that the \"globalization\" process has a behavior exactly\nequivalent to a system that is tending to a maximum entropy state and predicts\nthe apparition of big common markets and strong common currencies that will\nfind its \"equilibrium\" by decreasing its number until they get a state\ncharacterized by only one common currency and only one common market around the\nworld.\n", "  The so called \"globalization\" process (i.e. the inexorable integration of\nmarkets, currencies, nation-states, technologies and the intensification of\nconsciousness of the world as a whole) has a behavior exactly equivalent to a\nsystem that is tending to a maximum entropy state. This globalization process\nobeys a collective welfare principle in where the maximum payoff is given by\nthe equilibrium of the system and its stability by the maximization of the\nwelfare of the collective besides the individual welfare. This let us predict\nthe apparition of big common markets and strong common currencies. They will\nreach the \"equilibrium\" by decreasing its number until they reach a state\ncharacterized by only one common currency and only one big common community\naround the world.\n", "  Quantum games have proposed a new point of view for the solution of the\nclassical problems and dilemmas in game theory. Certain quantization\nrelationships can be proposed with the objective that a game can be generalized\ninto a quantum domain where the linear superposition of actions is allowed.\nThis quantization let us describe and solution problems originated by\nconflicting or cooperative behaviors among the members of a system from the\npoint of view of quantum mechanical interactions. This leads us to interesting\naspects which only can be observed through the quantization of a game like the\npossibility of the entanglement between players, the definition of a\nsocioeconomical temperature in a system, the collective welfare principle,the\nanalysis of a game through elements of quantum information theory and the\nglobalization process. The relationships between quantum mechanics and game\ntheory are also studied and its shown how although both systems analyzed are\ndescribed through two theories apparently different (quantum mechanics and game\ntheory) both are analogous and thus exactly equivalents.\n", "  We discuss the possibility to interpret the residual entanglement for more\nthan three qubits in terms of distributed multipartite entanglement, or, in\nother words, possible extensions of the Coffman-Kundu-Wootters monogamy\nequality to higher qubit numbers. Existing knowledge on entanglement in\nmultipartite systems puts narrow constraints on the form of such extensions. We\nstudy various examples for families of pure four-qubit states for which the\ncharacterization of three-qubit and four-qubit entanglement in terms of\npolynomial invariants is known. These examples indicate that, although families\nwith such extensions do exist, a generalized monogamy equality cannot be found\nalong those lines.\n", "  The invariant-comb approach is a method to construct entanglement measures\nfor multipartite systems of qubits. The essential step is the construction of\nan antilinear operator that we call {\\em comb} in reference to the {\\em\nhairy-ball theorem}. An appealing feature of this approach is that for qubits\n(or spins 1/2) the combs are automatically invariant under $SL(2,\\CC)$, which\nimplies that the obtained invariants are entanglement monotones by\nconstruction. By asking which property of a state determines whether or not it\nis detected by a polynomial $SL(2,\\CC)$ invariant we find that it is the\npresence of a {\\em balanced part} that persists under local unitary\ntransformations. We present a detailed analysis for the maximally entangled\nstates detected by such polynomial invariants, which leads to the concept of\n{\\em irreducibly balanced} states. The latter indicates a tight connection with\nSLOCC classifications of qubit entanglement. \\\\ Combs may also help to define\nmeasures for multipartite entanglement of higher-dimensional subsystems.\nHowever, for higher spins there are many independent combs such that it is\nnon-trivial to find an invariant one. By restricting the allowed local\noperations to rotations of the coordinate system (i.e. again to the\n$SL(2,\\CC)$) we manage to define a unique extension of the concurrence to\ngeneral half-integer spin with an analytic convex-roof expression for mixed\nstates.\n", "  Characterization and quantification of multipartite entanglement is one of\nthe challenges in state-of-the-art experiments in quantum information\nprocessing. According to theory, this is achieved via entanglement monotones,\nthat is, functions that do not increase under stochastic local operations and\nclassical communication (SLOCC). Typically such monotones include the wave\nfunction and its time-reversal (antilinear-operator formalism) or they are\nbased on not completely positive maps (e.g., partial transpose). Therefore,\nthey are not directly accessible to experimental observations. We show how\nentanglement monotones derived from polynomial local SL$(2,\\CC)$ invariants can\nbe re-written in terms of expectation values of observables. Consequently, the\namount of entanglement---of specific SLOCC classes---in a given state can be\nextracted from the measurement of correlation functions of local operators.\n", "  We describe AlterBBN, a public C program for evaluating the abundances of the\nelements generated by Big-Bang nucleosynthesis (BBN). This program enables the\nuser to compute the abundances of the elements in the standard model of\ncosmology, and additionally provides possibilities to alter the assumptions of\nthe cosmological model in order to study their consequences on the abundances\nof the elements. In particular the baryon-to-photon ratio and the effective\nnumber of neutrinos, as well as the expansion rate and the entropy content of\nthe Universe during BBN can be modified in AlterBBN. Such features allow the\nuser to test the cosmological models by confronting them to BBN constraints. A\npresentation of the physics of BBN and the features of AlterBBN is provided\nhere under the form of a manual.\n", "  How networks endure damage is a central issue in neural network research.\nThis includes temporal as well as spatial pattern of damage. Here, based on\nsome very simple models we study the difference between a slow-growing and\nacute damage and the relation between the size and rate of injury. Our result\nshows that in both a three-layer and a homeostasis model a slow-growing damage\nhas a decreasing effect on network disability as compared with a fast growing\none. This finding is in accord with clinical reports where the state of\npatients before and after the operation for slow-growing injuries is much\nbetter that those patients with acute injuries.\n", "  In this article we will apply the first- and second-order supersymmetric\nquantum mechanics to obtain new exactly-solvable real potentials departing from\nthe inverted oscillator potential. This system has some special properties; in\nparticular, only very specific second-order transformations produce\nnon-singular real potentials. It will be shown that these transformations turn\nout to be the so-called complex ones. Moreover, we will study the factorization\nmethod applied to the inverted oscillator and the algebraic structure of the\nnew Hamiltonians.\n", "  Supersymmetry transformations of first and second order are used to generate\nHamiltonians with known spectra departing from the harmonic oscillator with an\ninfinite potential barrier. It is studied also the way in which the\neigenfunctions of the initial Hamiltonian are transformed. The first and\ncertain second order supersymmetric partners of the initial Hamiltonian possess\nthird-order differential ladder operators. Since systems with this kind of\noperators are linked with the Painlev\\'e IV equation, several solutions of this\nnon-linear second-order differential equation will be simply found.\n", "  In these lecture notes we shall study first the supersymmetric quantum\nmechanics (SUSY QM), specially when applied to the harmonic and radial\noscillators. In addition, we will define the polynomial Heisenberg algebras\n(PHA), and we will study the general systems ruled by them: for zero and first\norder we obtain the harmonic and radial oscillators, respectively; for second\nand third order PHA the potential is determined by solutions to Painleve IV\n(PIV) and Painleve V (PV) equations. Taking advantage of this connection, later\non we will find solutions to PIV and PV equations expressed in terms of\nconfluent hypergeometric functions. Furthermore, we will classify them into\nseveral solution hierarchies, according to the specific special functions they\nare connected with.\n", "  We present a scheme to generate three particle hyper-entanglement utilizing\npolarization and orbital angular momentum (OAM) of a photon. We show that the\ngenerated state can be used to teleport a two-qubit state described by the\npolarization and the OAM. The proposed quantum system has also been used to\ndescribe a new efficient quantum key distribution (QKD) protocol. We give a\nsketch of the experimental arrangement to realize the proposed teleportation\nand the QKD.\n", "  A simple way to find solutions of the Painlev\\'e IV equation is by\nidentifying Hamiltonian systems with third-order differential ladder operators.\nSome of these systems can be obtained by applying supersymmetric quantum\nmechanics (SUSY QM) to the harmonic oscillator. In this work, we will construct\nfamilies of coherent states for such subset of SUSY partner Hamiltonians which\nare connected with the Painlev\\'e IV equation. First, these coherent states are\nbuilt up as eigenstates of the annihilation operator, then as displaced\nversions of the extremal states, both involving the third-order ladder\noperators, and finally as extremal states which are also displaced but now\nusing the so called linearized ladder operators. To each SUSY partner\nHamiltonian corresponds two families of coherent states: one inside the\ninfinite subspace associated with the isospectral part of the spectrum and\nanother one in the finite subspace generated by the states created through the\nSUSY technique.\n", "  We measure weak lensing mass profiles of voids from a volume-limited sample\nof SDSS Luminous Red Galaxies (LRGs). We find voids using an algorithm designed\nto maximize the lensing signal by dividing the survey volume into 2D slices,\nand then finding holes in this 2D distribution of LRGs. We perform a stacked\nshear measurement on about 20,000 voids with radii between 15-55 Mpc/h and\nredshifts between 0.16-0.37. We measure the characteristic radial shear signal\nof voids with a signal-to-noise of 7. The mass profile corresponds to a\nfractional underdensity of about -0.4 inside the void radius and a slow\napproach to the mean density indicating a partially compensated void structure.\nWe compare our measured shape and amplitude with the predictions of Krause et\nal 2013. Voids in the galaxy distribution have been extensively modeled using\nsimulations and measured in the SDSS. We discuss how the addition of void mass\nprofiles can enable studies of galaxy formation and cosmology.\n", "  A model for the thermodynamics of a quantum heat bath is introduced. Under\nthe assumption that the bath molecules have finitely many degrees of freedom\nand are weakly interacting, we present a general derivation of the equation of\nstate of the bath in the thermodynamic limit. The relation between the\ntemperature and the specific energy of the bath depends on (i) the spectral\nproperties of the molecules, and (ii) the choice of probability measure on the\nstate space of a representative molecule. The results obtained illustrate how\nthe microscopic features of the molecular constituents determine the\nmacroscopic thermodynamic properties of the bath. Our findings can thus be used\nto compare the merits of different hypotheses for the equilibrium states of\nquantum systems. Two examples of plausible choices for the probability measure\nare considered in detail.\n", "  Two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials, especially the transition metal sulfide\nsemiconductors, have drawn great interests due to their potential applications\nin viable photonic and optoelectronic devices, such as saturable absorbers\n(SAs) and optical switches, etc. In this work, tungsten disulfide (WS2) based\nSA for ultrafast photonic applications was demonstrated. WS2 nanosheets were\nprepared using liquid-phase exfoliation method and embedded in polyvinyl\nalcohol (PVA) thin film for the practical usage. Saturable absorption was\nobserved in the WS2-PVA SA at the telecommunication waveband near 1550 nm. By\nincorporating WS2-PVA SA into a fiber laser cavity, both stable mode locking\noperation and Q-switching operation were achieved. In the mode locking\noperation, the laser obtained femtosecond output pulse width and high spectral\npurity in the radio frequency spectrum. In the Q-switching operation, the laser\nhad tunable repetition rate and output pulse energy of a few tens of nano\njoule. Our findings suggest that few-layer WS2 nanosheets embedded in PVA thin\nfilm are promising nonlinear optical materials for ultrafast photonic\napplications as a mode locker or Q-switcher.\n", "  We investigate dispersionless integrable systems in 3D associated with\nfourfolds in the Grassmannian Gr(3,5). Such systems appear in numerous\napplications in continuum mechanics, general relativity and differential\ngeometry, and include such well-known examples as the dispersionless\nKadomtsev-Petviashvili equation, the Boyer-Finley equation, etc. We prove the\nequivalence of the four different approaches to integrability, revealing a\nremarkable correspondence with Einstein-Weyl geometry and the theory of GL(2,R)\nstructures.\n", "  We construct small-amplitude solitary traveling gravity-capillary water waves\nwith a finite number of point vortices along a vertical line, on finite depth.\nThis is done using a local bifurcation argument. The properties of the\nresulting waves are also examined: We find that they depend significantly on\nthe position of the point vortices in the water column.\n", "  We introduce a new class of noncommutative spectral triples on Kellendonk's\n$C^*$-algebra associated with a nonperiodic substitution tiling. These spectral\ntriples are constructed from fractal trees on tilings, which define a geodesic\ndistance between any two tiles in the tiling. Since fractals typically have\ninfinite Euclidean length, the geodesic distance is defined using\nPerron-Frobenius theory, and is self-similar with scaling factor given by the\nPerron-Frobenius eigenvalue. We show that each spectral triple is\n$\\theta$-summable, and respects the hierarchy of the substitution system. To\nelucidate our results, we construct a fractal tree on the Penrose tiling, and\nexplicitly show how it gives rise to a collection of spectral triples.\n", "  In this work, we use regularized determinant approach to study the discrete\nspectrum generated by relatively compact non-self-adjoint perturbations of the\nmagnetic Schr\\\"odinger operator $(-i\\nabla - \\textbf{\\textup{A}})^{2} - b$ in\ndimension $3$ with constant magnetic field of strength $b>0$. The situation\nnear the Landau levels $2bq$, $q \\in \\mathbb{N}$, is more interesting since\nthey play the role of thresholds of the spectrum of the free operator. First,\nwe obtain sharp upper bounds on the number of the complex eigenvalues near the\nLandau levels. Under appropriate hypothesis, we then prove the presence of an\ninfinite number of complex eigenvalues near each Landau level $2bq$, $q \\in\n\\mathbb{N}$, and the existence of sectors free of complex eigenvalues. We also\nprove that the eigenvalues are localized in certain sectors adjoining the\nLandau levels. In particular, we provide an adequate answer to the open problem\nfrom [34] about the existence of complex eigenvalues accumulating near the\nLandau levels. Furthermore, we prove that the Landau levels are the only\npossible accumulation points of the complex eigenvalues.\n", "  The lace expansion is a powerful perturbative technique to analyze the\ncritical behavior of random spatial processes such as the self-avoiding walk,\npercolation and lattice trees and animals. The non-backtracking lace expansion\n(NoBLE) is a modification that allows us to improve its applicability in the\nnearest-neighbor setting on the $\\mathbb Z^d$-lattice for percolation, lattice\ntrees and lattice animals.\n  The NoBLE gives rise to a recursive formula that we study in this paper at a\ngeneral level. We state assumptions that guarantee that the solution of this\nrecursive formula satisfies the infrared bound. In two related papers, we show\nthat these conditions are satisfied for percolation in $d\\geq 11$, for lattice\ntrees in $d\\geq 16$ and for lattice animals in $d\\geq 21$.\n", "  Recently, a broadcasting multiple blind signature scheme based on quantum\nteleportation has been proposed for the first time. It is claimed to have\nunconditional security and properties of quantum multiple signature and quantum\nblind signature. In this paper, we analyze the security of the protocol and\nshow that the signatory Ui can learn the signed message m by a single particle\nmeasurement and the signed message m can be modified at random by anyone\naccording to the scheme. Furthermore, there are some participant attacks and\nexternal attacks existing in the scheme. Finally we present an improved\nprotocol and show that the improved scheme can resist all of the mentioned\nattacks. Meanwhile, the secret keys can be used again and again, which will\nmake it more efficient and practical.\n", "  The statistics of peaks in weak gravitational lensing maps is a promising\ntechnique to constrain cosmological parameters in present and future surveys.\nHere we investigate its power when using general extreme value statistics which\nis very sensitive to the exponential tail of the halo mass function. To this\nend, we use an analytic method to quantify the number of weak lensing peaks\ncaused by galaxy clusters, large-scale structures and observational noise.\nDoing so, we further improve the method in the regime of high signal-to-noise\nratios dominated by non-linear structures by accounting for the embedding of\nthose counts into the surrounding shear caused by large scale structures. We\nderive the extreme value and order statistics for both over-densities (positive\npeaks) and under-densities (negative peaks) and provide an optimized criterion\nto split a wide field survey into sub-fields in order to sample the\ndistribution of extreme values such that the expected objects causing the\nlargest signals are mostly due to galaxy clusters. We find good agreement of\nour model predictions with a ray-tracing $N$-body simulation. For a Euclid-like\nsurvey, we find tight constraints on $\\sigma_8$ and $\\Omega_\\text{m}$ with\nrelative uncertainties of $\\sim 10^{-3}$. In contrast, the equation of state\nparameter $w_0$ can be constrained only with a $10\\%$ level, and $w_\\text{a}$\nis out of reach even if we include redshift information.\n", "  We establish new lower bounds for the convergence radius of the Mayer series\nand the Virial series of a continuous particle system interacting via a stable\nand tempered pair potential. Our bounds considerably improve those given by\nPenrose and Ruelle in 1963 for the Mayer series and by Lebowitz and Penrose in\n1964 for the Virial series. To get our results we exploit the tree-graph\nidentity given by Penrose in 1967 using a new partition scheme based on minumum\nspanning trees.\n", "  We analyse the asymptotic growth of the error for Hamiltonian flows due to\nsmall random perturbations. We compare the forward error with the reversibility\nerror, showing their equivalence for linear flows on a compact phase space. The\nforward error, given by the root mean square deviation $\\sigma(t)$ of the noisy\nflow, grows according to a power law if the system is integrable and according\nto an exponential law if it is chaotic.\n  The autocorrelation and the fidelity, defined as the correlation of the\nperturbed flow with respect to the unperturbed one, exhibit an exponential\ndecay as $\\exp\\left(-\\sigma^2(t)\\right)$. Some numerical examples such as the\nanharmonic oscillator and the H\\'enon Heiles model confirm these results. We\nfinally consider the effect of the observational noise on an integrable system,\nand show that the decay of correlations can only be observed after a sequence\nof measurements and that the multiplicative noise is more effective if the\ndelay between two measurements is large.\n", "  We review theoretical progress and prospects for determining the nucleon's\nstatic dipole polarisabilities from Compton scattering on few-nucleon targets,\nincluding new values; see Refs. [1-5] for details and a more thorough\nbibliography.\n", "  We calculate the properties of isospin-asymmetric nuclear matter based on\nchiral nucleon-nucleon (NN) and three-nucleon (3N) interactions. To this end,\nwe develop an improved normal-ordering framework that allows to include general\n3N interactions starting from a plane-wave partial-wave-decomposed form. We\npresent results for the energy per particle for general isospin asymmetries\nbased on a set of different Hamiltonians, study their saturation properties,\nthe incompressibility, symmetry energy, and also provide an analytic\nparametrization for the energy per particle as a function of density and\nisospin asymmetry.\n", "  We investigate the spectral statistics of the difference of two density\nmatrices, each of which is independently obtained by partially tracing a random\nbipartite pure quantum state. We first show how a closed-form expression for\nthe exact joint eigenvalue probability density function for arbitrary\ndimensions can be obtained from the joint probability density function of the\ndiagonal elements of the difference matrix, which is straightforward to\ncompute. Subsequently, we use standard results from free probability theory to\nderive a relatively simple analytic expression for the asymptotic eigenvalue\ndensity (AED) of the difference matrix ensemble, and using Carlson's theorem,\nwe obtain an expression for its absolute moments. These results allow us to\nquantify the typical asymptotic distance between the two random mixed states\nusing various distance measures; in particular, we obtain the almost sure\nasymptotic behavior of the operator norm distance and the trace distance.\n", "  Many applications in photonics require all-optical manipulation of plasma\nwaves, which can concentrate electromagnetic energy on sub-wavelength length\nscales. This is difficult in metallic plasmas because of their small optical\nnonlinearities. Some layered superconductors support weakly damped plasma\nwaves, involving oscillatory tunneling of the superfluid between capacitively\ncoupled planes. Such Josephson plasma waves (JPWs) are also highly nonlinear,\nand exhibit striking phenomena like cooperative emission of coherent terahertz\nradiation, superconductor-metal oscillations and soliton formation. We show\nhere that terahertz JPWs in cuprate superconductors can be parametrically\namplified through the cubic tunneling nonlinearity. Parametric amplification is\nsensitive to the relative phase between pump and seed waves and may be\noptimized to achieve squeezing of the order parameter phase fluctuations or\nsingle terahertz-photon devices.\n", "  We prove the existence as well as regularity of a finite range decomposition\nfor the resolvent $G_{\\alpha} (x-y,m^2) = ((-\\Delta)^{\\alpha\\over 2} +\nm^{2})^{-1} (x-y) $, for $0<\\alpha<2$ and all real $m$, in the lattice\n${\\mathbf Z}^{d}$ as well as in the continuum ${\\mathbf R}^{d}$ for dimension\n$d\\ge 2$. This resolvent occurs as the covariance of the Gaussian measure\nunderlying weakly self- avoiding walks with long range jumps (stable L\\'evy\nwalks) as well as continuous spin ferromagnets with long range interactions in\nthe long wavelength or field theoretic approximation. The finite range\ndecomposition should be useful for the rigorous analysis of both critical and\noff-critical renormalisation group trajectories. The decomposition for the\nspecial case $m=0$ was known and used earlier in the renormalisation group\nanalysis of critical trajectories for the above models below the critical\ndimension $d_c =2\\alpha$. This revised version makes some changes, adds new\nmaterial, and also corrects some errors in the previous version. It refers to\nthe author's published article with the same title in J Stat Phys (2016) 163:\n1235-1246, as well as to an erratum to be published in J Stat Phys.\n", "  Density functional theory offers a very accurate way of computing materials\nproperties from first principles. However, it is too expensive for modelling\nlarge-scale molecular systems whose properties are, in contrast, computed using\ninteratomic potentials.\n  The present paper considers, from a mathematical point of view, the problem\nof constructing interatomic potentials that approximate a given\nquantum-mechanical interaction model. In particular, a new class of\nsystematically improvable potentials is proposed, analyzed, and tested on an\nexisting quantum-mechanical database.\n", "  In contrast to that a weak value of an observable is usually divided into\nreal and imaginary parts, here we show that separation into modulus and\nargument is important for modular values. We first show that modular values are\nexpressed by the average of dynamic phase factors with complex conditional\nprobabilities. We then relate, using the polar decomposition, the modulus of\nthe modular value to the relative change in the qubit pointer post-selection\nprobabilities, and relate the argument of the modular value to the summation of\na geometric phase and an intrinsic phase.\n", "  Discontinuous Galerkin Finite Element (DGFE) methods offer a mathematically\nbeautiful, computationally efficient, and efficiently parallelizable way to\nsolve hyperbolic partial differential equations. These properties make them\nhighly desirable for numerical calculations in relativistic astrophysics and\nmany other fields. The BSSN formulation of the Einstein equations has\nrepeatedly demonstrated its robustness. The formulation is not only stable but\nallows for puncture-type evolutions of black hole systems. To-date no one has\nbeen able to solve the full (3+1)-dimensional BSSN equations using DGFE\nmethods. This is partly because DGFE discretization often occurs at the level\nof the equations, not the derivative operator, and partly because DGFE methods\nare traditionally formulated for manifestly flux-conservative systems. By\ndiscretizing the derivative operator, we generalize a particular flavor of DGFE\nmethods, Local DG methods, to solve arbitrary second-order hyperbolic\nequations. Because we discretize at the level of the derivative operator, our\nmethod can be interpreted as either a DGFE method or as a finite differences\nstencil with non-constant coefficients.\n", "  We consider a system of fermions with a quasi-random almost-Mathieu disorder\ninteracting through a many-body short range potential. We establish exponential\ndecay of the zero temperature correlations, indicating localization of the\ninteracting ground state, for weak hopping and interaction and almost\neverywhere in the frequency and phase; this extends the analysis in \\cite{M} to\nchemical potentials outside spectral gaps. The proof is based on\nRenormalization Group and is inspired by techniques developed to deal with KAM\nLindstedt series.\n", "  We develop a formalism for calculating soft limits of $n$-point inflationary\ncorrelation functions using separate universe techniques. Our method naturally\nallows for multiple fields and leads to an elegant diagrammatic approach. As an\napplication we focus on the trispectrum produced by inflation with multiple\nlight fields, giving explicit formulae for all possible single- and double-soft\nlimits. We also investigate consistency relations and present an infinite tower\nof inequalities between soft correlation functions which generalise the\nSuyama-Yamaguchi inequality.\n", "  The supersymmetric index of the 4d $\\mathcal{N} = 1$ theory realized by a\nbrane tiling coincides with the partition function of an integrable 2d lattice\nmodel. We argue that a class of half-BPS surface defects in brane tiling models\nare represented on the lattice model side by transfer matrices constructed from\nL-operators. For the simplest surface defects in theories with $\\mathrm{SU}(2)$\nflavor groups, we identify the relevant L-operator as that discovered by\nSklyanin in the context of the eight-vertex model. We verify this\nidentification by computing the indices of class-$\\mathcal{S}$ and\n-$\\mathcal{S}_k$ theories in the presence of the surface defects.\n", "  Multiplexed quantum memories capable of storing and processing entangled\nphotons are essential for the development of quantum networks. In this context,\nwe demonstrate the simultaneous storage and retrieval of two entangled photons\ninside a solid-state quantum memory and measure a temporal multimode capacity\nof ten modes. This is achieved by producing two polarization entangled pairs\nfrom parametric down conversion and mapping one photon of each pair onto a\nrare-earth-ion doped (REID) crystal using the atomic frequency comb (AFC)\nprotocol. We develop a concept of indirect entanglement witnesses, which can be\nused as Schmidt number witness, and we use it to experimentally certify the\npresence of more than one entangled pair retrieved from the quantum memory. Our\nwork puts forward REID-AFC as a platform compatible with temporal multiplexing\nof several entangled photon pairs along with a new entanglement certification\nmethod useful for the characterisation of multiplexed quantum memories.\n", "  We study the spherical collapse model in the presence of external\ngravitational tidal shear fields for different dark energy scenarios and\ninvestigate the impact on the mass function and cluster number counts. While\nprevious studies of the influence of shear and rotation on $\\delta_\\mathrm{c}$\nhave been performed with heuristically motivated models, we try to avoid this\nmodel dependence and sample the external tidal shear values directly from the\nstatistics of the underlying linearly evolved density field based on first\norder Lagrangian perturbation theory. Within this self-consistent approach, in\nthe sense that we restrict our treatment to scales where linear theory is still\napplicable, only fluctuations larger than the scale of the considered objects\nare included into the sampling process which naturally introduces a mass\ndependence of $\\delta_\\mathrm{c}$. We find that shear effects are predominant\nfor smaller objects and at lower redshifts, i. e. the effect on\n$\\delta_\\mathrm{c}$ is at or below the percent level for the $\\Lambda$CDM\nmodel. For dark energy models we also find small but noticeable differences,\nsimilar to $\\Lambda$CDM. The virial overdensity $\\Delta_\\mathrm{V}$ is nearly\nunaffected by the external shear. The now mass dependent $\\delta_c$ is used to\nevaluate the mass function for different dark energy scenarios and afterwards\nto predict cluster number counts, which indicate that ignoring the shear\ncontribution can lead to biases of the order of $1\\sigma$ in the estimation of\ncosmological parameters like $\\Omega_\\mathrm{m}$, $\\sigma_8$ or $w$.\n", "  H{\\sc i} absorption studies of active galaxies enable us to probe their\ncircumnuclear regions and the general interstellar medium, and study the supply\nof gas which may trigger the nuclear activity. In this paper, we investigate\nthe detection rate of H{\\sc i} absorption on the nature of radio galaxies based\non their emission-line spectra, nature of the host galaxies based on the\n\\textit{WISE} colours and their radio structure, which may help understand the\ndifferent accretion modes. We find significant difference in distributions of\nW2$-$W3 colour for sources with H{\\sc i} absorption detections and\nnon-detections. We report a high detection rate of H{\\sc i} absorption in the\ngalaxies with \\textit{WISE} infrared colours W2$-$W3 $>$ 2, which is typical of\ngas-rich systems, along with a compact radio structure. The H{\\sc i} detection\nrate for low-excitation radio galaxies (LERGs) with W2$-$W3 $>$ 2 and compact\nradio structure is high (70.6$\\pm$20.4 \\%). In HERGs, compact radio structure\nin the nuclear or circumnuclear region could give rise to absorption by gas in\nthe dusty torus in addition to gas in the interstellar medium. However, higher\nspecific star formation rate (sSFR) for the LERGs with W2$-$W3 $>$ 2 suggests\nthat H{\\sc i} absorption may be largely due to star-forming gas in their hosts.\nLERGs with extended radio structure tend to have significantly lower values of\nW2$-$W3 compared to those with compact structure. Extended radio sources and\nthose with W2$-$W3 $<$ 2 have low H{\\sc i} detection rates.\n", "  A search is presented for new resonances decaying to a $W$ or $Z$ boson and a\nHiggs boson in the $\\ell^+ \\ell^- b\\bar b$, $\\ell\\nu b\\bar b$, and\n$\\nu\\bar{\\nu} b\\bar b$ channels in $pp$ collisions at $\\sqrt s = 13$ TeV with\nthe ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider using a total integrated\nluminosity of 3.2 fb$^{-1}$. The search is conducted by looking for a localized\nexcess in the $WH$/$ZH$ invariant or transverse mass distribution. No\nsignificant excess is observed, and the results are interpreted in terms of\nconstraints on a simplified model based on a phenomenological Lagrangian of\nheavy vector triplets.\n", "  Circulant matrices are an important family of operators, which have a wide\nrange of applications in science and engineering related fields. They are in\ngeneral non-sparse and non-unitary. In this paper, we present efficient quantum\ncircuits to implement circulant operators using fewer resources and with lower\ncomplexity than existing methods. Moreover, our quantum circuits can be readily\nextended to the implementation of Toeplitz, Hankel, and block circulant\nmatrices. Efficient quantum algorithms to implement the inverses and products\nof circulant operators are also provided.\n", "  In this paper, we investigate how the LHC data limit the Higgs-related\ncouplings in the effective description of a strongly interacting extension of\nthe Standard model. The Higgs boson is introduced as a scalar composite state\nand it is followed in the mass hierarchy by an $SU(2)$ triplet of vector\ncomposites. The limits are calculated from the constraints obtained in the\nrecent ATLAS+CMS combined analysis of the data from 2011 and 2012. We find that\nthe data prefer the scenario where the Higgs couplings to the electroweak gauge\nbosons differ from its couplings to the vector triplet. We also investigate the\nunitarity limits of the studied effective model for the experimentally\npreferred values of the Higgs couplings. We find from the\n$\\pi\\pi\\rightarrow\\pi\\pi$ scattering amplitudes that for the vector resonance\nmasses between one and two TeV significant portions of the experimentally\nallowed regions are well below the unitarity limit. We also evaluate how the\nexisting ATLAS and CMS Run-2 data restrict our model with the upper bounds on\nthe resonance production cross section times its branching ratio for various\ndecay channels. The masses in the range $1\\;\\mbox{TeV}\\leq M_\\rho\\leq\n2\\;\\mbox{TeV}$ are not excluded in parts or even full parameter space of our\ntheory.\n", "  The hyperbolic Anosov C-systems have a countable set of everywhere dense\nperiodic trajectories which have been recently used to generate pseudorandom\nnumbers. The asymptotic distribution of periodic trajectories of C-systems with\nperiods less than a given number is well known, but a deviation of this\ndistribution from its asymptotic behaviour is less known. Using fast\nalgorithms, we are studying the exact distribution of periodic trajectories and\ntheir deviation from asymptotic behaviour for hyperbolic C-systems which are\ndefined on high dimensional tori and are used for Monte-Carlo simulations. A\nparticular C-system which we consider in this article is the one which was\nimplemented in the MIXMAX generator of pseudorandom numbers. The generator has\nthe best combination of speed, reasonable size of the state, and availability\nfor implementing the parallelization and is currently available generator in\nthe ROOT and CLHEP software packages at CERN.\n", "  Neutron matter is an ideal laboratory for nuclear interactions derived from\nchiral effective field theory since all contributions are predicted up to\nnext-to-next-to-next-to-leading order (N$^3$LO) in the chiral expansion. By\nmaking use of recent advances in the partial-wave decomposition of three-\nnucleon (3N) forces, we include for the first time N$^3$LO 3N interactions in\nmany-body perturbation theory (MBPT) up to third order and in self-consistent\nGreen's function theory (SCGF). Using these two complementary many-body\nframeworks we provide improved predictions for the equation of state of neutron\nmatter at zero temperature and also analyze systematically the many-body\nconvergence for different chiral EFT interactions. Furthermore, we present an\nextension of the normal-ordering framework to finite temperatures. These\ndevelopments open the way to improved calculations of neutron-rich matter\nincluding estimates of theoretical uncertainties for astrophysical\napplications.\n", "  We present the photospheric energy density of magnetic fields in two solar\nactive regions inferred from observational vector magnetograms, and compare it\nwith the possible different defined energy parameters of magnetic fields in the\nphotosphere. We analyze the magnetic fields in active region NOAA\n6580-6619-6659 and 11158. It is noticed that the quantity 1/4pi Bn.Bp is an\nimportant energy parameter that reflects the contribution of magnetic shear on\nthe difference between the potential magnetic field (Bp) and non-potential one\n(Bn), and also the contribution to the free magnetic energy near the magnetic\nneutral lines in the active regions. It is found that the photospheric mean\nmagnetic energy density changes obviously before the powerful solar flares in\nthe active region NOAA 11158, it is consistent with the change of magnetic\nfields in the lower atmosphere with flares.\n", "  The dielectric properties of the prototypical frustrated ferromagnetic\nspin-chain compound PbCuSO$_4$(OH)$_2$ known as linarite, are studied across\nits strongly anisotropic magnetic phase diagram in single crystal samples. The\nferroelectric character of the principal low-field spin spiral phase is\nconfirmed. The measured polarization is fully consistent with the previously\nproposed magnetic structure. Spontaneous polarization is also detected in two\nother field-induced phases but in some cases is incompatible with previously\nsuggested models for the spin arrangement.\n", "  Starting from a Geometrothermodynamics metric for the space of thermodynamic\nequilibrium states in the mass representation, we use numerical techniques to\nanalyse the thermodynamic geodesics of a supermassive Reissner Nordstr\\\"{o}m\nblack hole in isolation. Appropriate constraints are obtained by taking into\naccount the processes of Hawking radiation and Schwinger pair--production. We\nmodel the black hole in line with the work of Hiscock and Weems. It can be\ndeduced that the relation which the geodesics establish between the entropy $S$\nand electric charge $Q$ of the black hole extremises changes in the black\nhole's mass. Indeed, the expression for the entropy of an extremal black hole\nis an exact solution to the geodesic equation. We also find that in certain\ncases, the geodesics describe the evolution brought about by the constant\nemission of Hawking radiation and charged-particle pairs.\n", "  The Stern-Gerlach-Experiment (SGE) of 1922 is a seminal benchmark experiment\nof quantum physics providing evidence for several fundamental properties of\nquantum systems. Based on today's knowledge we illustrate the different\nbenchmark results of the SGE for the development of modern quantum physics and\nchemistry.\n  The SGE provided the first direct experimental evidence for angular momentum\nquantization in the quantum world and thus also for the existence of\ndirectional quantization of all angular momenta in the process of measurement.\nIt measured for the first time a ground state property of an atom, it produced\nfor the first time a `spin-polarized' atomic beam, it almost revealed the\nelectron spin. The SGE was the first fully successful molecular beam experiment\nwith high momentum-resolution by beam measurements in vacuum. This technique\nprovided a new kinematic microscope with which inner atomic or nuclear\nproperties could be investigated.\n  The original SGE is described together with early attempts by Einstein,\nEhrenfest, Heisenberg, and others to understand directional quantization in the\nSGE. Heisenberg's and Einstein's proposals of an improved multi-stage SGE are\npresented. The first realization of these proposals by Stern, Phipps, Frisch\nand Segr\\`e is described. The set-up suggested by Einstein can be considered an\nanticipation of a Rabi-apparatus. Recent theoretical work is mentioned in which\nthe directional quantization process and possible interference effects of the\ntwo different spin states are investigated.\n  In full agreement with the results of the new quantum theory directional\nquantization appears as a general and universal feature of quantum\nmeasurements. One experimental example for such directional quantization in\nscattering processes is shown. Last not least, the early history of the\n`almost' discovery of the electron spin in the SGE is revisited.\n", "  The Littlest Seesaw (LS) model involves two right-handed neutrinos and a very\nconstrained Dirac neutrino mass matrix, involving one texture zero and two\nindependent Dirac masses, leading to a highly predictive scheme in which all\nneutrino masses and the entire PMNS matrix is successfully predicted in terms\nof just two real parameters. We calculate the renormalisation group (RG)\ncorrections to the LS predictions, with and without supersymmetry, including\nalso the threshold effects induced by the decoupling of heavy Majorana\nneutrinos both analytically and numerically. We find that the predictions for\nneutrino mixing angles and mass ratios are rather stable under RG corrections.\nFor example we find that the LS model with RG corrections predicts close to\nmaximal atmospheric mixing, $\\theta_{23}=45^\\circ \\pm 1^\\circ$, in most\nconsidered cases, in tension with the latest NOvA results. The techniques used\nhere apply to other seesaw models with a strong normal mass hierarchy.\n", "  Radiatively decaying dark matter may be searched through investigating the\nphoton spectrum of galaxies and galaxy clusters. We explore whether the\nproperties of dark matter can be constrained through the study of a\npolarization state of emitted photons. Starting from the basic principles of\nquantum mechanics we show that the models of symmetric dark matter are\nindiscernible by the photon polarization. However, we find that the asymmetric\ndark matter consisted of Dirac fermions is a source of circularly polarized\nphotons, calling for the experimental determination of the photon state.\n", "  We show that, under the effect of an external magnetic field, a photogalvanic\neffect and the generation of second harmonic wave can be induced in\ninversion-symmetric and time reversal invariant Dirac semimetals. The mechanism\nresponsible of these non linear optical responses is the magnetochiral effect.\nThe origin of this magnetochiral effect is the band bending of the dispersion\nrelation in real Dirac semimetals. Some observable consequences of this\nphenomenon are the appearance of a dc current on the surface of the system when\nit is irradiated with linearly polarized light or a rotation of the\npolarization plane of the reflected second harmonic wave.\n", "  Rapid cooling of liquids below a certain temperature range can result in a\ntransition to glassy states. The traditional understanding of glasses includes\ntheir thermodynamic metastability with respect to crystals. However, here we\npresent specific examples of interactions that eliminate the possibilities of\ncrystalline and quasicrystalline phases, while creating mechanically stable\namorphous glasses down to absolute zero temperature. We show that this can be\naccomplished by introducing a new ideal state of matter called a \"perfect\nglass.\" A perfect glass represents a soft-interaction analog of the maximally\nrandom jammed (MRJ) packings of hard particles. These latter states can be\nregarded as the epitome of a glass since they are out of equilibrium, maximally\ndisordered, hyperuniform, mechanically rigid with infinite bulk and shear\nmoduli, and can never crystallize due to configuration-space trapping. Our\nmodel perfect glass utilizes two-, three-, and four-body soft interactions\nwhile simultaneously retaining the salient attributes of the MRJ state. These\nmodels constitute a theoretical proof of concept for perfect glasses and\nbroaden our fundamental understanding of glass physics. A novel feature of\nequilibrium systems of identical particles interacting with the perfect-glass\npotential at positive temperature is that they have a non-relativistic speed of\nsound that is infinite.\n", "  The polarization of $\\Lambda$ hyperons from relativistic flow vorticity is\nstudied in peripheral heavy ion reactions at FAIR and NICA energies, just above\nthe threshold of the transition to the Quark-Gluon Plasma. Previous\ncalculations at higher energies with larger initial angular momentum, predicted\nsignificant $\\Lambda$ polarization based on the classical vorticity term in the\npolarization, while relativistic modifications decreased the polarization and\nchanged its structure in the momentum space. At the lower energies studied\nhere, we see the same effect namely that the relativistic modifications\ndecrease the polarization arising from the initial shear flow vorticity.\n", "  Recently in [Physica A 411 (2014) 138] Ili\\'{c} and Stankovi\\'{c} have\nsuggested that there may be problem for the class of hybrid entropies\nintroduced in [P.~Jizba and T.~Arimitsu, Physica A 340 (2004) 110]. In this\nComment we point out that the problem can be traced down to the $q$-additive\nentropic chain rule and to a peculiar behavior of the DeFinetti--Kolmogorov\nrelation for escort distributions. However, despite this, one can still safely\nuse the proposed hybrid entropies in most of the statistical-thermodynamics\nconsiderations.\n", "  An important question in the theory of double parton scattering is how to\nincorporate the possibility of the parton pairs being generated perturbatively\nvia $1 \\to 2$ splitting into the theory, whilst avoiding double counting with\nsingle parton scattering loop corrections. Here, we describe a consistent\napproach for solving this problem, which retains the notion of double parton\ndistributions (DPDs) for individual hadrons. Further, we discuss the\nconstruction of appropriate model DPDs in our framework, and the use of these\nto compute the DPS part, presenting DPS 'luminosities' from our model DPDs for\na few sample cases.\n", "  Over the past few decades, magnetic resonance imaging has been utilized as a\npowerful imaging modality to evaluate the structure and function of various\norgans in the human body,such as the brain. Additionally, diffusion and\nperfusion MR imaging have been increasingly used in neurovascular clinical\napplications. In diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging, the mobility of\nwater molecules is explored in order to obtain information about the\nmicroscopic behavior of the tissues. In contrast, perfusion weighted imaging\nuses tracers to exploit hemodynamic status, which enables researchers and\nclinicians to consider this imaging modality as an early biomarker of certain\nbrain diseases. In this review, the fundamentals of physics for diffusion and\nperfusion MR imaging both of which are highly sensitive to microenvironmental\nalterations at the cellular level as well as their application in the treatment\nof aging, Alzheimer's disease, brain tumors and cerebral ischemic injury were\ndiscussed.\n", "  In this study, current pumping by an external potential is studied on the\nbasis of the Keldysh Green's function method, and a pumping formula written in\nterms of retarded and advanced Green's functions is obtained. It is shown that\npumping is essentially driven by a change of particle distribution before and\nafter an external perturbation. The formula is used to study the spin pumping\neffect in the case of strong sd exchange interaction, and the driving field is\nidentified to be the spin gauge field. At the lowest order in the precession\nfrequency of magnetization, the spin gauge field works as a constant potential,\nand the system is shown to reduce to a static problem of spin current\ngeneration by a time-independent potential with off-diagonal spin components.\n", "  The QCD string model is employed to evaluate the masses of orbitally and\nradially excited heavy-light mesons and lightest hybrids in the spectrum of\ncharmonium and bottomonium. The number of parameters of the model is reduced to\nonly seven which are the string tension, the two values of the strong coupling\nconstant (one for heavy-light and $\\bar{c}c$ mesons and one for $\\bar{b}b$\nmesons), and the four overall spectrum shift constants which depend on the\nquark contents of the particular meson or hybrid family. A few well-established\nstates in the spectrum of heavy-light and heavy-heavy mesons are used to fix\nthese parameters, and then the masses of other mesons and hybrids come out as\npredictions of the model which are confronted with the existing experimental\ndata, and a few suggestions are made concerning yet not measured quantum\nnumbers of some states in the spectrum of charmonium and bottomonium.\n", "  This is a review of some recent works which demonstrate how the classical\nequations of gravity in AdS themselves hold the key to understanding their\nholographic origin in the form of a strongly coupled large $N$ QFT whose\nalgebra of local operators can be generated by a few (single-trace) elements. I\ndiscuss how this can be realised by reformulating Einstein's equations in AdS\nin the form of a non-perturbative RG flow that further leads to a new approach\ntowards constructing strongly interacting QFTs. In particular, the RG flow can\nself-determine the UV data that are otherwise obtained by solving classical\ngravity equations and demanding that the solutions do not have naked\nsingularities. For a concrete demonstration, I focus on the hydrodynamic limit\nin which case this RG flow connects the AdS/CFT correspondence with the\nmembrane paradigm, and also reproduces the known values of the dual QFT\ntransport coefficients.\n", "  We prove a generalization of the Lindblad's fundamental no-go result: A\nquantum system cannot be completely frozen and, in some cases, even thermalized\nvia translationally invariant dissipation -- the quantum friction.\nNevertheless, a practical methodology is proposed for engineering nearly\nperfect quantum analogs of classical friction within the Doppler cooling\nframework. These findings pave the way for hallmark dissipative engineering\n(e.g. nonreciprocal couplings) with atoms and molecules.\n", "  In this contribution, I will discuss two topics related to the clustering of\natomic nuclei. The first is dual character of the ground state. Recently, it\nwas pointed out that the ground states of atomic nuclei have dual character of\nshell and cluster implying that both of the single-particle excitation and\ncluster excitation occur as the fundamental excitation modes. The isoscalar\nmonopole and dipole transitions are regarded as the triggers to induce the\ncluster excitation. By referring the Hartree-Fock and antisymmetrized molecular\ndynamics calculations, the dual character and those transitions are explained.\nThe second is the linear-chain state of $^{16}{\\rm C}$ in which the linearly\naligned 3$\\alpha$ particles are sustained by the valence neutrons. The rather\nconvincing evidences for this exotic state are very recently reported by\nseveral experiments. Here, I introduce a couple of theoretical analysis and\npredictions.\n", "  We demonstrate the effectiveness of a novel scheme for numerically solving\nlinear differential equations whose solutions exhibit extreme oscillation. We\ntake a standard Runge-Kutta approach, but replace the Taylor expansion formula\nwith a Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin method. The method is demonstrated by\napplication to the Airy equation, along with a more complicated\nburst-oscillation case. Finally, we compare our scheme to existing approaches.\n", "  In this work, Gibbs paradox was discussed from the view of observer. The\nlimitations of real observer are analyzed quantitatively. The entropy of mixing\nwas found to be determined by both the identification ability and the\ninformation already in hand of an observer.\n", "  We have analyzed the light curves of 519 short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs)\ndetected in the SPI-ACS/INTEGRAL experiment from December 2002 to May 2014 to\nsearch for precursors. Both the light curves of 519 individual events and the\naveraged light curve of 372 brightest bursts have been analyzed. In a few\ncases, we have found and thoroughly studied precursor candidates based on\nSPI-ACS/INTEGRAL, GBM/Fermi, and LAT/Fermi data. A statistical analysis of the\naveraged light curve for the entire sample of short bursts has revealed no\nregular precursor. Upper limits for the relative intensity of precursors have\nbeen estimated. No convincing evidence for the existence of precursors of short\nGRBs has been found. We show that the fraction of short GRBs with precursors is\nless than 0.4% of all short bursts.\n", "  This letter reports the influence of noisy channels on JRSP of two-qubit\nequatorial state. We present a scheme for JRSP of two-qubit equatorial state.\nWe employ two tripartite Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) entangled states as\nthe quantum channel linking the parties. We find the success probability to be\n$1/4$. However, this probability can be ameliorated to $3/4$ if the state\npreparers assist by transmitting individual partial information through\nclassical channel to the receiver non-contemporaneously. Afterward, we\ninvestigate the effects of five quantum noises: the bit-flip noise, bit-phase\nflip noise, amplitude-damping noise, phase-damping noise and depolarizing noise\non the JRSP process. We obtain the analytical derivation of the fidelities\ncorresponding to each quantum noisy channel, which is a measure of information\nloss as the qubits are being distributed in these quantum channels. We find\nthat the system loses some of its properties as a consequence of unwanted\ninteractions with environment. For instance, within the domain\n$0<\\lambda<0.65$, the information lost via transmission of qubits in amplitude\nchannel is most minimal, while for $0.65<\\lambda\\leq1$, the information lost in\nphase flip channel becomes the most minimal. Also, for any given $\\lambda$, the\ninformation transmitted through depolarizing channel has the least chance of\nsuccess.\n", "  We study, further, a conjectured formula for generalized two-qubit\nHilbert-Schmidt separability probabilities that has recently been proven by\nLovas and Andai (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.01410.pdf) for its real (two-rebit)\nasserted value ($\\frac{29}{64}$), and that has also been very strongly\nsupported numerically for its complex ($\\frac{8}{33}$), and quaternionic\n($\\frac{26}{323}$) counterparts. Now, we seek to test the presumptive\noctonionic value of $\\frac{44482}{4091349} \\approx 0.0108722$. We are somewhat\nencouraged by certain numerical computations, indicating that this\n(51-dimensional) instance of the conjecture might be fulfilled by setting a\ncertain determinantal-power parameter $a$, introduced by Forrester\n(https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.08081.pdf), to 0 (or possibly near to 0).\nHilbert-Schmidt measure being the case $k=0$ of random induced measure, for\n$k=1$, the corresponding octonionic separability probability conjecture is\n$\\frac{7612846}{293213345} \\approx 0.0259635$, while for $k=2$, it is\n$\\frac{4893392}{95041567} \\approx 0.0514869, \\ldots$. The relation between the\nparameters $a$ and $k$ is explored.\n", "  The evolution of brown dwarfs from L to T spectral types is one of the least\nunderstood aspects of the ultracool population, partly for lack of a large,\nwell-defined, and well-characterized sample in the L/T transition. To improve\nthe existing census, we have searched $\\approx$28,000 deg$^2$ using the\nPan-STARRS1 and WISE surveys for L/T transition dwarfs within 25 pc. We present\n130 ultracool dwarf discoveries with estimated distances $\\approx9-130$ pc,\nincluding 21 that were independently discovered by other authors and 3 that\nwere previously identified as photometric candidates. Seventy-nine of our\nobjects have near-IR spectral types of L6-T4.5, the most L/T transition dwarfs\nfrom any search to date, and we have increased the census of L9-T1.5 objects\nwithin 25 pc by over 50%. The color distribution of our discoveries provides\nfurther evidence for the \"L/T gap,\" a deficit of objects with $(J-K)_{\\rm\nMKO}\\approx0.0-0.5$ mag in the L/T transition, and thus reinforces the idea\nthat the transition from cloudy to clear photospheres occurs rapidly. Among our\ndiscoveries are 31 candidate binaries based on their low-resolution spectral\nfeatures. Two of these candidates are common proper motion companions to nearby\nmain sequence stars; if confirmed as binaries, these would be rare benchmark\nsystems with the potential to stringently test ultracool evolutionary models.\nOur search also serendipitously identified 23 late-M and L dwarfs with\nspectroscopic signs of low gravity implying youth. Finally, we identify 10\ncandidate members of nearby young moving groups (YMG) with spectral types\nL7-T4.5, including three showing spectroscopic signs of low gravity. If\nconfirmed, any of these would be among the coolest known YMG members and would\nhelp to determine the effective temperature at which young brown dwarfs cross\nthe L/T transition. (Abridged)\n", "  We present the 1-loop renormalization of the energy momentum tensor using the\noverlap fermion and a HYP-smeared Iwasaki gauge action. We also calculate the\n1-loop matching coefficient that convert the lattice simulation results\nrenormalized in the RI/MOM scheme to the $\\overline{\\textrm{MS}}$ scheme. The\ndependence of the renormalization on the gauge action and the number of HYP\nsmearing steps are also investigated.\n", "  Nitrogen is a major nutrient for all life on Earth and could plausibly play a\nsimilar role in extraterrestrial biospheres. The major reservoir of nitrogen at\nEarth's surface is atmospheric N2, but recent studies have proposed that the\nsize of this reservoir may have fluctuated significantly over the course of\nEarth's history with particularly low levels in the Neoarchean - presumably as\na result of biological activity. We used a biogeochemical box model to test\nwhich conditions are necessary to cause large swings in atmospheric N2\npressure. Parameters for our model are constrained by observations of modern\nEarth and reconstructions of biomass burial and oxidative weathering in deep\ntime. A 1-D climate model was used to model potential effects on atmospheric\nclimate. In a second set of tests, we perturbed our box model to investigate\nwhich parameters have the greatest impact on the evolution of atmospheric pN2\nand consider possible implications for nitrogen cycling on other planets. Our\nresults suggest that (a) a high rate of biomass burial would have been needed\nin the Archean to draw down atmospheric pN2 to less than half modern levels,\n(b) the resulting effect on temperature could probably have been compensated by\nincreasing solar luminosity and a mild increase in pCO2, and (c) atmospheric\noxygenation could have initiated a stepwise pN2 rebound through oxidative\nweathering. In general, life appears to be necessary for significant\natmospheric pN2 swings on Earth-like planets. Our results further support the\nidea that an exoplanetary atmosphere rich in both N2 and O2 is a signature of\nan oxygen-producing biosphere.\n", "  Surface interaction is extremely important to both fundamental research and\npractical application. Physisorption can induce shape and structural distortion\n(i.e. conformational changes) in macromolecular and biomolecular adsorbates,\nbut such phenomenon has rarely been observed on adsorbents. Here, we\ndemonstrate theoretically and experimentally that atomically thin boron nitride\n(BN) nanosheets as an adsorbent experience conformational changes upon surface\nadsorption of molecules, increasing adsorption energy and efficiency. The study\nnot only provides new perspectives on the strong adsorption capability of BN\nnanosheets and many other two-dimensional nanomaterials but also opens up\npossibilities for many novel applications. For example, we demonstrate that BN\nnanosheets with the same surface area as bulk hBN particles are more effective\nin purification and sensing.\n", "  Hydrocarbon tribopolymer, a type of polymer formed due to friction between\nsurfaces, is a major impediment to the development of micro- and\nnanoelectromechanical systems (MEMS/NEMS) devices for industrial application.\nTribopolymer buildup can prevent MEMS and NEMS from making or breaking\nelectrical contact. We describe the adsorption of benzene (C6H6) on the\nRuO2(110) surface using density functional theory. This adsorption is an\nimportant initial step in the mechanism of hydrocarbon tribopolymer layer\nformation on MEMS and NEMS devices. The adsorption interaction is studied by\nconsidering three oxygen coverages of RuO2(110) and all the possible adsorption\nsites for benzene. We find that adsorption of benzene on O-poor RuO2(110) via\nC-Ru bonds is stronger than adsorption on the O-rich RuO2(110) via H-O bonds.\nFor an in-depth study of the adsorption behavior, we include the van der Waals\ninteraction for a holistic investigation. By incorporating the thermodynamic\nchemical potentials into the adsorption simulations, we describe a model that\ncan provide guidance for realistic situations.\n", "  Within the framework of pQCD, we systematically study the $W^{\\pm}/Z^0$ boson\nproduction as a probe of cold nuclear matter effects and nuclear parton\ndistributions in p+Pb and Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC and future colliders. A\ndetailed analysis at partonic level is performed. Moreover, with a\nsemi-microscopic KP model of NPDFs, in which several nuclear effects (e.g.\nFermi motion and nuclear binding, the off-shell correction, the nuclear\ncoherent correction, and the nuclear meson correction) are included, we study\nthe vector boson rapidity distribution in p+Pb collisions at the LHC, and a\nvery good agreement with the latest data is found, including the $W$-boson\ncharge asymmetry.\n", "  We discuss the problem of extending data mining approaches to cases in which\ndata points arise in the form of individual graphs. Being able to find the\nintrinsic low-dimensionality in ensembles of graphs can be useful in a variety\nof modeling contexts, especially when coarse-graining the detailed graph\ninformation is of interest. One of the main challenges in mining graph data is\nthe definition of a suitable pairwise similarity metric in the space of graphs.\nWe explore two practical solutions to solving this problem: one based on\nfinding subgraph densities, and one using spectral information. The approach is\nillustrated on three test data sets (ensembles of graphs); two of these are\nobtained from standard graph generating algorithms, while the graphs in the\nthird example are sampled as dynamic snapshots from an evolving network\nsimulation. We further incorporate these approaches with equation free\ntechniques, demonstrating how such data mining approaches can enhance\nscientific computation of network evolution dynamics.\n", "  The observation of neutrinoless double beta decay will have important\nconsequences. First it will signal that lepton number is not conserved and the\nneutrinos are Majorana particles. Second, it represents our best hope for\ndetermining the absolute neutrino mass scale at the level of a few tens of meV.\nTo achieve the last goal, however, certain hurdles have to be overcome\ninvolving particle, nuclear and experimental physics. Particle physics is\nimportant since it provides the mechanisms for neutrinoless double beta decay.\nIn this review we emphasize the light neutrino mass mechanism. Nuclear physics\nis important for extracting the useful information from the data. One must\naccurately evaluate the relevant nuclear matrix elements, a formidable task. To\nthis end, we review the recently developed sophisticated nuclear structure\napproaches, employing different methods and techniques of calculation. We also\nexamine the question of quenching of the axial vector coupling constant, which\nmay have important consequences on the size of the nuclear matrix elements.\nFrom an experimental point of view it is challenging, since the life times are\nextremely long and one has to fight against formidable backgrounds. One needs\nlarge isotopically enriched sources and detectors with good energy resolution\nand very low background.\n", "  This work is a conceptual analysis of certain recent developments in the\nmathematical foundations of Classical and Quantum Mechanics which have allowed\nto formulate both theories in a common language. From the algebraic point of\nview, the set of observables of a physical system, be it classical or quantum,\nis described by a \\emph{Jordan-Lie algebra}. From the geometric point of view,\nthe space of states of any system is described by a \\emph{uniform Poisson space\nwith transition probability}. Both these structures are here perceived as\nformal translations of \\emph{the fundamental twofold role of properties in\nMechanics}: they are at the same time quantities and transformations. The\nquestion becomes then to understand the precise articulation between these two\nroles. The analysis will show that Quantum Mechanics can be thought as\ndistinguishing itself from Classical Mechanics by a compatibility condition\nbetween properties-as-quantities and properties-as-transformations.\n  Moreover, this dissertation shows the existence of a tension between a\ncertain \"abstract way\" of conceiving mathematical structures, used in the\npractice of mathematical physics, and the necessary capacity to specify\nparticular states or observables. It then becomes important to understand how,\nwithin the formalism, one can construct a \\emph{labelling scheme}. The \"Chase\nfor Individuation\" is the analysis of different mathematical techniques which\nattempt to overcome this tension. In particular, we discuss how group theory\nfurnishes a partial solution.\n", "  We have performed Raman scattering measurements on URu$_2$Si$_2$ single\ncrystals on a large energy range up to $\\sim$ 1300 cm$^{-1}$ and in all the\nRaman active symmetries as a function of temperature down to 15 K. A large\nexcitation, active only in the E$_{g}$ symmetry, is reported. It has been\nassigned to a crystal electric field excitation on the Uranium site. We discuss\nhow this constrains the crystal electric field scheme of the Uranium ions.\nFurthermore, three excitations in the A$_{1g}$ symmetry are observed. They have\nbeen associated to double Raman phonon processes consistently with ab initio\ncalculations of the phonons dispersion.\n", "  An appealing definition of the term \"molecule\" arises from consideration of\nthe nature of fluorescence, with discrete molecular entities emitting a stream\nof single photons. We address the question of how large a molecular object may\nbecome by growing deterministic aggregates from single conjugated polymer\nchains. Even particles containing dozens of individual chains still behave as\nsingle quantum emitters due to efficient excitation energy transfer, while the\nbrightness is raised due to the increased absorption cross-section of the\nsuprastructure. Excitation energy can delocalize between individual polymer\nchromophores in these aggregates by both coherent and incoherent coupling,\nwhich are differentiated by their distinct spectroscopic fingerprints. Coherent\ncoupling is identified by a ten-fold increase in excited-state lifetime and a\ncorresponding spectral red shift. Exciton quenching due to incoherent FRET\nbecomes more significant as aggregate size increases, resulting in\nsingle-aggregate emission characterized by strong blinking. This mesoscale\napproach allows us to identify intermolecular interactions which do not exist\nin isolated chains and are inaccessible in bulk films where they are present\nbut masked by disorder.\n", "  We present nonlinear optical absorption properties of pulsed laser deposited\nthin films of topological insulator (TI), Bi2Se3 on quartz substrate, using\nopen aperture Z - scan technique. The saturable intensity of as-deposited thin\nfilms has been found remarkably improved by an order of magnitude compared to\nthe values reported earlier in the literature. Past results from the literature\nare inconclusive in establishing whether the saturable absorption is coming\nfrom surface states or the bulk. Specifically designed experiments with\nmagnetically doped TI samples allow us to attribute the saturable absorption\ncharacteristic of TI to the bulk states. Detailed experimental procedures and\npossible explanation of observed results have been discussed.\n", "  Blinking of the photoluminescence (PL) emitted from individual conjugated\npolymer chains is one of the central observations made by single-molecule\nspectroscopy (SMS). Important information, e.g., regarding excitation energy\ntransfer, can be extracted by evaluating dynamic quenching. However, the nature\nof trap states, which are responsible for PL quenching, often remains obscured.\nWe present a detailed investigation of the photon statistics of single\npoly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) chains obtained by SMS. The photon statistics\nprovide a measure of the number and brightness of independently emitting areas\non a single chain. These observables can be followed during blinking. A\ndecrease in PL intensity is shown to be correlated with either (i) a decrease\nin the average brightness of the emitting sites; or (ii) a decrease in the\nnumber of emitting regions. We attribute these phenomena to the formation of\n(i) shallow charge traps, which can weakly affect all emitting areas of a\nsingle chain at once; and (ii) deep traps, which have a strong effect on small\nregions within the single chains.\n", "  New interatomic potentials describing defects, plasticity and high\ntemperature phase transitions for Ti are presented. Fitting the martensitic\nhcp-bcc phase transformation temperature requires an efficient and accurate\nmethod to determine it. We apply a molecular dynamics (MD) method based on\ndetermination of the melting temperature of competing solid phases, and\nGibbs-Helmholtz integration, and a lattice-switch Monte Carlo method (LSMC):\nthese agree on the hcp-bcc transformation temperatures to within 2 K. We were\nable to develop embedded atom potentials which give a good fit to either low or\nhigh temperature data, but not both. The first developed potential (Ti1)\nreproduces the hcp-bcc transformation and melting temperatures and is suitable\nfor the simulation of phase transitions and bcc Ti. Two other potentials (Ti2\nand Ti3) correctly describe defect properties, and can be used to simulate\nplasticity or radiation damage in hcp Ti. The fact that a single EAM potential\ncannot describe both low and high temperature phases may be attributed to\nneglect of electronic degrees of freedom, notably bcc has a much higher\nelectronic entropy. A temperature-dependent potential obtained from the\ncombination of potentials Ti1 and Ti2 may be used to simulate Ti properties at\nany temperature.\n", "  We obtained new high-resolution spectra using the Lijiang 1.8-m and 2.4-m\ntelescopes to investigate the chromospheric activities of V1355 Ori as\nindicated in the behaviors of Ca ii H&K, Hdelta, Hgamma, Hbeta, Na i D1, D2,\nHalpha and Ca ii infrared triplet (IRT) lines. The observed spectra show\nobvious emissions above the continuum in Ca ii H&K lines, absorptions in the\nHdelta, Hgamma, Hbeta and Na i D1, D2 lines, variable behavior (filled-in\nabsorption, partial emission with a core absorption component or emission above\nthe continuum) in the Halpha line, and weak self-reversal emissions in the\nstrong filled-in absorptions of the Ca ii IRT lines. We used a spectral\nsubtraction technique to analyze our data. The results show no excess emission\nin the Hdelta and Hgamma lines, very weak excess emissions in the Na i D1, D2\nlines, excess emission in the Hbeta line, clear excess emission in the Halpha\nline, and excess emissions in the Ca ii IRT lines. The value of the ratio of\nEW8542/EW8498 is in the range 0.9 to 1.7, which implies that chromospheric\nactivity might have been caused by plage events. The value of the ratio E\nHalpha/E Hbeta is above 3, indicating that the Balmer lines would arise from\nprominence-like material. We also found time variations in light curves\nassociated with equivalent widths of chromospheric activity lines in the Na i\nD1, D2, Ca ii IRT and Halpha lines in particular. These phenomena can be\nexplained by plage events, which are consistent with the behavior of\nchromospheric activity indicators.\n", "  In the framework of complexity theory, which provides a unified framework for\nnatural and social sciences, we study the complex and interesting problem of\nthe internal structure, similarities, and differences between the Mazatec\ndialects, an endangered Otomanguean language spoken in south-east Mexico. The\nanalysis is based on some databases, which are used to compute linguistic\ndistances between the dialects. The results are interpreted in the light of\nlinguistics as well as statistical considerations and used to infer the history\nof the development of the observed pattern of diversity.\n", "  The associated production of a single top quark together with a Higgs boson\nat the LHC can be used to lift the degeneracy regarding the sign of the top\nquark Yukawa coupling. Therefore, t-channel and tW-channel production where the\nHiggs boson is decaying into a $\\mathrm{b}\\overline{\\mathrm{b}}$ pair is\ninspected. Boosted decision trees are used to assign jets to the quarks in the\nfinal state and classify the events. To maximize the separation between the\nsignal and the dominating $\\mathrm{t}\\overline{\\mathrm{t}}$ background each\nevent is reconstructed under a signal and a $\\mathrm{t}\\overline{\\mathrm{t}}$\nhypothesis. The poster focuses on the event selection and the reconstruction of\nevents.\n", "  We discuss the intriguing photophysics of a giant molecular spoked wheel of\npi-conjugated arylenealkynylene chromophores on the single-molecule level. This\n\"molecular mesoscopic\" tructure, C1878H2682, shows fast switching between the\n12 identical chromophores since the fluorescence is unpolarised but only one\nchromophore emits at a time.\n", "  This paper celebrates the remarkable life, science and legacy of Abb\\'e\nGeorges Lema\\^itre, the Belgian cleric and professor of physics; he was the\narchitect of the fireworks model for the origin of the universe. He died half a\ncentury ago, three days after learning that Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson had\ndiscovered the cosmic microwave background. Despite being gravely ill from\nleukaemia, Lema\\^itre lucidly praised this news, which confirmed the explosive\ngenesis of our universe.\n", "  Transition-metal dichalcogenides can be easily produced as atomically thin\nsheets, exhibiting the possibility to optically polarize and read out the\nvalley pseudospin of extremely stable excitonic quasiparticles present in these\n2D semiconductors. Here, we investigate a monolayer of tungsten disulphide in\nhigh magnetic fields up to 30\\,T via photoluminescence spectroscopy at low\ntemperatures. The valley degeneracy is lifted for all optical features,\nparticularly for excitons, singlet and triplet trions, for which we determine\nthe g factor separately. While the observation of a diamagnetic shift of the\nexciton and trion resonances gives us insight into the real-space extension of\nthese quasiparticles, magnetic field induced valley polarization effects shed\nlight onto the exciton and trion dispersion relations in reciprocal space. The\nfield dependence of the trion valley polarizations is in line with the\npredicted trion splitting into singlet and triplet configurations.\n", "  The rapidly increasing use of sensors throughout different research\ndisciplines and the demand for more efficient devices with less power\nconsumption depends critically on the emergence of new sensor materials and\nnovel sensor concepts. Atomically thin transition metal dichalcogenides have a\nhuge potential for sensor development within a wide range of applications.\nTheir optimal surface-to-volume ratio combined with strong light-matter\ninteraction results in a high sensitivity to changes in their surrounding.\nHere, we present a novel, highly efficient sensing mechanism to detect\nmolecules based on dark excitons in these materials. We show that the presence\nof molecules with a dipole moment transforms dark states into bright excitons\nresulting in an additional pronounced peak in easy accessible optical spectra.\nThis effect exhibits a huge potential for sensor applications, since it offers\nan unambiguous optical finger print for the detection of molecules - in\ncontrast to common sensing schemes relying on small peak shifts and intensity\nchanges.\n", "  We investigate the spin Hall effect in perpendicularly magnetized\nTa/Co40Fe40B20/MgO trilayers with Ta underlayers thicker than the spin\ndiffusion length. The crystallographic structures of the Ta layer and Ta/CoFeB\ninterface are examined in detail using X-ray diffraction and transmission\nelectron microscopy. The thinnest Ta underlayer is amorphous, whereas for\nthicker Ta layers a disoriented tetragonal beta-phase appears. Effective\nspin-orbit torques are calculated based on harmonic Hall voltage measurements\nperformed in a temperature range between 15 and 300 K. To account for the\ntemperature dependence of damping-like and field-like torques, we extend the\nspin diffusion model by including an additional contribution from the Ta/CoFeB\ninterface. Based on this approach, the temperature dependence of the spin Hall\nangle in the Ta underlayer and at Ta/CoFeB interface are determined separately.\nThe results indicate an almost temperature-independent spin Hall angle of\ntheta_SH-N = -0.2 in Ta and a strongly temperature-dependent theta_SH-I for the\nintermixed Ta/CoFeB interface.\n", "  The trace of the heat kernel in a (D+1)-dimensional Euclidean spacetime\n(integer D > 1) is used to derive the free energy in finite temperature field\ntheory. The spacetime presents a D-dimensional compact space (domain) with a\n(D-1)-dimensional boundary, and a closed dimension, whose volume is\nproportional the Planck's inverse temperature. The thermal sum appears due to\ntopology of the closed Euclidean time. The obtained free energy in (3+1) and\n(2+1) dimensions contain two contributions defined by the volume of a domain\nand by the volume of the domain's boundary. This functional is finite and valid\nfor arbitrary values of the Planck's inverse temperature. The absolute zero of\nthermodynamic temperature is forbidden topologically, and no universal low\ntemperature asymptotics of the free energy can exist.\n", "  Semi-empirical mass formula of the atomic nucleus describe binding energies\nof the nuclei. In the simple form of this formula, there are five terms related\nto the properties of the nuclear structure. The coefficients in each terms can\nbe determined by various approach such as fitting on experimental binding\nenergy values. In this study, the surface energy coefficient in the formula\nwhich is a correction on total binding energy has been obtained by a method\nthat is not previously described in the literature. The experimental fission\nbarrier energies of nuclei have been used for this task. According to the\nresults, surface energy coefficient in one of the most conventional formula has\nbeen improved by a factor 3.4.\n", "  We investigate and compare different representations of the Riesz derivative,\nwhich plays an important role in anomalous diffusion and space fractional\nquantum mechanics. In particular, we show that a certain representation of the\nRiesz derivative that is generally given as also valid for order alpha equals\n1, behaves no differently than the other definition given in terms of its\nFourier transform. In the light of this, we discuss the alpha goes to 1 limit\nof the space fractional quantum mechanics and its consistency.\n", "  Two subjects are discussed in this work: localisation and recurrence in a\nmodel of quantum walk in a periodic potential, and a model of opinion dynamics\nwith multiple choices of opinions.\n", "  The topology of the Fermi surface of Sr2RuO4 is well described by\nlocal-density approximation calculations with spin-orbit interaction, but the\nrelative size of its different sheets is not. By accounting for many-body\neffects via dynamical mean-field theory, we show that the standard isotropic\nCoulomb interaction alone worsens or does not correct this discrepancy. In\norder to reproduce experiments, it is essential to account for the Coulomb\nanisotropy. The latter is small but has strong effects; it competes with the\nCoulomb-enhanced spin-orbit coupling and the isotropic Coulomb term in\ndetermining the Fermi surface shape. Its effects are likely sizable in other\ncorrelated multi-orbital systems. In addition, we find that the low-energy\nself-energy matrix -- responsible for the reshaping of the Fermi surface --\nsizably differ from the static Hartree-Fock limit. Finally, we find a strong\nspin-orbital {entanglement}; this supports the view that the conventional\ndescription of Cooper pairs via factorized spin and orbital part might not\napply to Sr2RuO4.\n", "  In this paper we propose a mechanistic model that links micro social\ninteractions to macro observables in the case of diffusion of film-going\ndecisions. We devise a generalized epidemic model to capture the temporal\nevolution of box office revenues. The model adds social influence and memory\neffects to conventional epidemic models. Fitting the model to a temporal data\nset containing domestic weekly revenue of the 5000 top US-grossing films of all\ntime, we find that a two-parameter model can capture a remarkable portion of\nthe observed variance in the data. Using the distribution of the estimated\nparameters for different genres, we then present a predictive model which\nprovides reasonable a-priori estimates of future sale as a function of time.\n", "  We investigate the sensitivity of top pair production to the properties of\ndifferent Beyond the Standard Model theories embedding a new neutral boson. We\ninclude six-fermion decay, and account for the full tree-level Standard Model\nttbar interference, with all intermediate particles allowed off-shell. We focus\non those observables best suited to the lepton-plus-jets final state at the\nLHC, and simulate the resulting experimental conditions, including kinematic\nrequirements and top quark pair reconstruction in the presence of missing\ntransverse energy and combinatorial ambiguity in quark-top assignment. In\nparticular, we demonstrate the use of asymmetry observables to probe the\ncoupling structure of a new neutral resonance, in addition to cases in which\nthese asymmetries may even form complementary discovery observables in\ncombination with the differential cross section.\n", "  In a previous paper, we examined a class of possible conformations for\nhelically patterned filaments in contact with a bonding surface. In particular,\nwe investigated geometries where contact between the pattern and the surface\nwas improved through a periodic twisting and lifting of the filament. A\nconsequence of this lifting is that the total length of the filament projected\nonto the surface decreases after bonding. When the bonding character of the\nsurface is actuated, this phenomenon can lead to both lifelike \"inchworm\"\nbehavior of the filaments and ensemble movement. We illustrate, through\nsimulation, how pattern formation may be achieved through this mechanism.\n", "  Hot subdwarf stars (sdO/Bs) are evolved core helium-burning stars with very\nthin hydrogen envelopes, which can be formed by common envelope ejection. Close\nsdB binaries with massive white dwarf (WD) companions are potential progenitors\nof thermonuclear supernovae type Ia (SN~Ia). We discovered such a progenitor\ncandidate as well as a candidate for a surviving companion star, which escapes\nfrom the Galaxy. More candidates for both types of objects have been found by\ncrossmatching known sdB stars with proper motion and light curve catalogues. We\nfound 72 sdO/B candidates with high Galactic restframe velocities, 12 of them\nmight be unbound to our Galaxy. Furthermore, we discovered the second-most\ncompact sdB+WD binary known. However, due to the low mass of the WD companion,\nit is unlikely to be a SN\\,Ia progenitor.\n", "  While the idea of using the operator product expansion (OPE) to extract the\nstrong coupling from hadronic $\\tau$ decay data is not new, there is an ongoing\ncontroversy over how to include quark-hadron \"duality violations\" (i.e.,\nresonance effects) which are not described by the OPE. One approach attempts to\nsuppress duality violations enough that they might become negligible, but pays\nthe price of an uncontrolled OPE truncation. We critically examine a recent\nanalysis using this approach and show that it fails to properly account for\nnon-perturbative effects, making the resulting determination of the strong\ncoupling unreliable. In a different approach duality violations are taken into\naccount with a model, avoiding the OPE truncation. This second approach\nprovides a self-consistent determination of the strong coupling from $\\tau$\ndecays.\n", "  In this letter, the impact of pump configuration on the modal instabilities\n(MI) threshold of high power fiber amplifiers is investigated. Using a time\ndependent computer model based on the optical beam propagation method (BPM),\nthe effect of bidirectional pumping on the MI threshold of high power fiber\namplifiers is explored and compared to that of a co-pumped configuration.\nSimulation results indicate that the bidirectional pumping increases the\ninstabilities threshold by a factor of 30% with respect to the co-pumped\nscheme. We attribute this threshold enhancement to a weaker strength of the\ntemperature induced refractive index grating due to a more homogeneous pump\nprofile along the fiber length. This technique demonstrates that the\nengineering pump scheme is a promising approach leading to an appreciable\nthreshold enhancement of fiber amplifiers designed for high power applications.\n", "  We present new observations of all three ground-state transitions of the\nmethylidyne (CH) radical and all four ground-state transitions of the hydroxyl\n(OH) radical toward a sharp boundary region of the Taurus molecular cloud.\nThese data were analyzed in conjunction with existing CO and dust images. The\nderived CH abundance is consistent with previous observations of translucent\nclouds ($0.8\\le A_{v} \\le 2.1$ mag). The $X({\\rm CH})$-factor is nearly a\nconstant at $(1.0\\pm0.06)\\times 10^{22}$ $\\rm {cm^{-2}~K^{-1}~km^{-1}~s}$ in\nthis extinction range, with less dispersion than that of the more widely used\nmolecular tracers CO and OH. CH turns out be a better tracer of total column\ndensity in such an intermediate extinction range than CO or OH. Compared with\nprevious observations, CH is overabundant below 1 mag extinction. Such an\noverabundance of CH is consistent with the presence of a C-shock. CH has two\nkinematic components, one of which shifts from 5.3 to 6 km s$^{-1}$, while the\nother stays at 6.8 km s$^{-1}$ when moving from outside toward inside of the\ncloud. These velocity behaviors exactly match with previous OH observation. The\nshifting of the two kinematic components indicates colliding streams or gas\nflow at the boundary region, which could be the cause of the C-shock.\n", "  Transparent tissue scaffolds enable illumination of growing tissue to\naccelerate cell proliferation and improve other cell functions through\nphotobiomodulation. The biphasic dose response of cells exposed to\nphotobiomodulating light dictates that the illumination to be evenly\ndistributed across the scaffold such that the cells are neither under nor over\nexposed to light. However, equalized illumination has not been sufficiently\naddressed. Here we analyze and experimentally demonstrate spatially equalizing\nillumination by three methods, namely, engineered surface scattering,\nreflection by a gold mirror, and traveling-waves in a ring mesh. Our results\nshow that nearly equalized illumination is achievable by controlling the light\nscattering-to-loss ratio. This demonstration opens opportunities for\ndose-optimized photobiomodulation in tissue regeneration.\n", "  We review the quantization of scalar and gauge fields using Rindler\ncoordinates with an emphasis on the physics of the Rindler horizon. In the\nthermal state at the Unruh temperature, correlators match their Minkowski\nvacuum values and the renormalized stress tensor vanishes, while at any other\ntemperature the renormalized stress-energy diverges on the horizon. After\ngiving a new derivation of some of these results using canonical quantization\nin the thermofield double state, we comment on the relevance of fluxes and\nboundary conditions at the horizon, which have arisen in calculations of\nentanglement entropy.\n", "  We analyze the relationships between game theory and quantum mechanics and\nthe extensions to statistical physics and information theory. We use certain\nquantization relationships to assign quantum states to the strategies of a\nplayer. These quantum states are contained in a density operator which\ndescribes the new quantum system. The system is also described through an\nentropy over its states, its evolution equation which is the quantum replicator\ndynamics and a criterion of equilibrium based on the Collective Welfare\nPrinciple. We show how the density operator and entropy are the bonds between\ngame theories, quantum information theory and statistical physics. We propose\nthe results of the study of these relationships like a reason of the\napplicability of physics in economics and the born of econophysics.\n", "  The relationships between game theory and quantum mechanics let us propose\ncertain quantization relationships through which we could describe and\nunderstand not only quantum but also classical, evolutionary and the biological\nsystems that were described before through the replicator dynamics. Quantum\nmechanics could be used to explain more correctly biological and economical\nprocesses and even it could encloses theories like games and evolutionary\ndynamics. This could make quantum mechanics a more general theory that we had\nthought. Although both systems analyzed are described through two apparently\ndifferent theories (quantum mechanics and game theory) it is shown that both\nsystems are analogous and thus exactly equivalents. So, we can take some\nconcepts and definitions from quantum mechanics and physics for the best\nunderstanding of the behavior of economics and biology. Also, we could maybe\nunderstand nature like a game in where its players compete for a common welfare\nand the equilibrium of the system that they are members.\n", "  We propose quantization relationships which would let us describe and\nsolution problems originated by conflicting or cooperative behaviors among the\nmembers of a system from the point of view of quantum mechanical interactions.\nThe quantum analogue of the replicator dynamics is the equation of evolution of\nmixed states from quantum statistical mechanics. A system and all its members\nwill cooperate and rearrange its states to improve their present condition.\nThey strive to reach the best possible state for each of them which is also the\nbest possible state for the whole system. This led us to propose a quantum\nequilibrium in which a system is stable only if it maximizes the welfare of the\ncollective above the welfare of the individual. If it is maximized the welfare\nof the individual above the welfare of the collective the system gets unstable\nand eventually it collapses.\n", "  The present work is an introductory study about entropy its properties and\nits role in quantum information theory. In a next work, we will use these\nresults to the analysis of a quantum game described by a density operator and\nwith its entropy equal to von Neumann's.\n", "  We propose the study of quantum games from the point of view of quantum\ninformation theory and statistical mechanics. Every game can be described by a\ndensity operator, the von Neumann entropy and the quantum replicator dynamics.\nThere exists a strong relationship between game theories, information theories\nand statistical physics. The density operator and entropy are the bonds between\nthese theories. The analysis we propose is based on the properties of entropy,\nthe amount of information that a player can obtain about his opponent and a\nmaximum or minimum entropy criterion. The natural trend of a physical system is\nto its maximum entropy state. The minimum entropy state is a characteristic of\na manipulated system i.e. externally controlled or imposed. There exist tacit\nrules inside a system that do not need to be specified or clarified and search\nthe system equilibrium under the collective welfare principle. The other rules\nare imposed over the system when one or many of its members violate this\nprinciple and maximize its individual welfare at the expense of the group.\n"]}
