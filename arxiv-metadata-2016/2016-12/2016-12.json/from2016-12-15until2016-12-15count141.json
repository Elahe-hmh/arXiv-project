In order to solve this problem, two analytical\nschemes are developed based on the replica method and Thouless-Anderson-Palmer\n(TAP) approach by utilizing an integral formula concerning random rectangular\nmatrices. The validity and relevance of the developed methodologies are shown\nfor one known result and two example problems. A message-passing algorithm to\nperform the TAP scheme is also presented.\n", "  We consider the geodesic motion on the symmetric moduli spaces that arise\nafter timelike and spacelike reductions of supergravity theories. The geodesics\ncorrespond to timelike respectively spacelike $p$-brane solutions when they are\nlifted over a $p$-dimensional flat space. In particular, we consider the\nproblem of constructing \\emph{the minimal generating solution}: A geodesic with\nthe minimal number of free parameters such that all other geodesics are\ngenerated through isometries. We give an intrinsic characterization of this\nsolution in a wide class of orbits for various supergravities in different\ndimensions. We apply our method to three cases: (i) Einstein vacuum solutions,\n(ii) extreme and non-extreme D=4 black holes in N=8 supergravity and their\nrelation to N=2 STU black holes and (iii) Euclidean wormholes in $D\\geq 3$. In\ncase (iii) we present an easy and general criterium for the existence of\nregular wormholes for a given scalar coset.\n", "  Learning behavior of simple perceptrons is analyzed for a teacher-student\nscenario in which output labels are provided by a teacher network for a set of\npossibly correlated input patterns, and such that teacher and student networks\nare of the same type. Our main concern is the effect of statistical\ncorrelations among the input patterns on learning performance. For this\npurpose, we extend to the teacher-student scenario a methodology for analyzing\nrandomly labeled patterns recently developed in {\\em J. Phys. A: Math. Theor.}\n{\\bf 41}, 324013 (2008). This methodology is used for analyzing situations in\nwhich orthogonality of the input patterns is enhanced in order to optimize the\nlearning performance.\n", "  We consider determinantal point processes on a compact complex manifold X in\nthe limit of many particles. The correlation kernels of the processes are the\nBergman kernels associated to a a high power of a given Hermitian holomorphic\nline bundle L over X. The empirical measure on X of the process, describing the\nparticle locations, converges in probability towards the pluripotential\nequilibrium measure, expressed in term of the Monge-Amp\\`ere operator. The\nasymptotics of the corresponding fluctuations in the bulk are shown to be\nasymptotically normal and described by a Gaussian free field and applies to\ntest functions (linear statistics) which are merely Lipschitz continuous.\nMoreover, a scaling limit of the correlation functions in the bulk is shown to\nbe universal and expressed in terms of (the higher dimensional analog of) the\nGinibre ensemble. This geometric setting applies in particular to normal random\nmatrix ensembles, the two dimensional Coulomb gas, free fermions in a strong\nmagnetic field and multivariate orthogonal polynomials.\n", "  The typical behavior of optimal solutions to portfolio optimization problems\nwith absolute deviation and expected shortfall models using replica analysis\nwas pioneeringly estimated by S. Ciliberti and M. M\\'ezard [Eur. Phys. B. 57,\n175 (2007)]; however, they have not yet developed an approximate derivation\nmethod for finding the optimal portfolio with respect to a given return set. In\nthis study, an approximation algorithm based on belief propagation for the\nportfolio optimization problem is presented using the Bethe free energy\nformalism, and the consistency of the numerical experimental results of the\nproposed algorithm with those of replica analysis is confirmed. Furthermore,\nthe conjecture of H. Konno and H. Yamazaki, that the optimal solutions with the\nabsolute deviation model and with the mean-variance model have the same typical\nbehavior, is verified using replica analysis and the belief propagation\nalgorithm.\n", "  We study planar two-dimensional quantum systems on a lattice whose\nHamiltonian is a sum of local commuting projectors of bounded range. We\nconsider whether or not such a system has a zero energy ground state. To do\nthis, we consider the problem as a one-dimensional problem, grouping all sites\nalong a column into \"supersites\"; using $C^*$-algebraic methods (Bravyi and\nVyalyi), we can solve this problem if we can characterize the central elements\nof the interaction algebra on these supersite. Unfortunately, these central\nelements may be very complex, making brute force impractical. Instead, we show\na characterization of these elements in terms of matrix product operators with\nbounded bond dimension. This bound can be interpreted as a bound on the number\nof particle types in lattice theories with bounded Hilbert space dimension on\neach site. Topological order in this approach is related to the existence of\ncertain central elements which cannot be \"broken\" into smaller pieces without\ncreating an end excitation. Using this bound on bond dimension, we prove that\nseveral special cases of this problem are in NP, and we give part of a proof\nthat the general case is in NP. Further, we characterize central elements that\nappear in certain specific models, including toric code and Levin-Wen models,\nas either product operators in the Abelian case or matrix product operators\nwith low bond dimension in the non-Abelian case; this matrix product operator\nrepresentation may have practical application in engineering the complicated\nmulti-spin interactions in the Levin-Wen models.\n", "  The transition radiation tracker (TRT) is the outermost of the three\nsub-systems of the ATLAS inner detector at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at\nCERN. It is designed to combine the drift tube tracker with the transition\nradiation detector, providing an important contribution to the charged\nparticles precise momentum measurement and particle (mainly electron)\nidentification. The TRT consists of a barrel section at small pseudorapidity\n(eta) and two separate end-cap partitions at large eta. The detector\nperformance and its operational conditions were permanently monitored during\nall commissioning and data-taking stages using various software tools, one of\nwhich - TRTViewer - is described in the present paper. The TRTViewer is the\ndedicated program for monitoring the TRT raw data quality and detector\nperformance at different hardware levels: individual straws, readout chips and\nelectronic boards. The data analysis results can be presented on the\nevent-by-event basis or in the form of color maps representing the operation\nparameters (efficiencies, timing, occupancy, etc.) according to the real\ngeometrical position of the detector hardware elements. The paper describes the\nTRTViewer software package as the event displaying tool, raw data processor and\nhistogram and operation parameters presenter, which works with the different\nsources of input information: raw data files, online monitoring histograms,\noffline analysis histograms and TRT DAQ Configuration database. The package\nproved to be one of the main instruments for the fast and effective TRT\ndiagnostics during debugging and operation periods.\n", "  We present several improvements to the standard Trotter-Suzuki based\nalgorithms used in the simulation of quantum chemistry on a quantum computer.\nFirst, we modify how Jordan-Wigner transformations are implemented to reduce\ntheir cost from linear or logarithmic in the number of orbitals to a constant.\nOur modification does not require additional ancilla qubits. Then, we\ndemonstrate how many operations can be parallelized, leading to a further\nlinear decrease in the parallel depth of the circuit, at the cost of a small\nconstant factor increase in number of qubits required. Thirdly, we modify the\nterm order in the Trotter-Suzuki decomposition, significantly reducing the\nerror at given Trotter-Suzuki timestep. A final improvement modifies the\nHamiltonian to reduce errors introduced by the non-zero Trotter-Suzuki\ntimestep. All of these techniques are validated using numerical simulation and\ndetailed gate counts are given for realistic molecules.\n", "  We provide an elementary proof of the equivalence of various notions of\nuniform hyperbolicity for a class of $\\mathrm{GL}(2,\\mathbb{C})$ cocycles and\nestablish a Johnson-type theorem for extended CMV matrices, relating the\nspectrum to the points on the unit circle for which the associated Szeg\\H{o}\ncocycle is not uniformly hyperbolic.\n", "  In this article, we discuss formal invariants of singularly-perturbed linear\ndifferential systems in neighborhood of turning points and give algorithms\nwhich allow their computation. The algorithms proposed are implemented in the\ncomputer algebra system Maple.\n", "  Quantum phase estimation algorithm has been successfully adapted as a sub\nframe of many other algorithms applied to a wide variety of applications in\ndifferent fields. However, the requirement of a good approximate eigenvector\ngiven as an input to the algorithm hinders the application of the algorithm to\nthe problems where we do not have any prior knowledge about the eigenvector.\n  In this paper, we show that the principal eigenvalue of an irreducible\nnon-negative operator can be determined by using an equal superposition initial\nstate in the phase estimation algorithm. This removes the necessity of the\nexistence of an initial good approximate eigenvector. Moreover, we show that\nthe success probability of the algorithm is related to the closeness of the\noperator to a stochastic matrix. Therefore, we draw an estimate for the success\nprobability by using the variance of the column sums of the operator. This\nprovides a priori information which can be used to know the success probability\nof the algorithm beforehand for the non-negative matrices and apply the\nalgorithm only in cases when the estimated probability reasonably high.\nFinally, we discuss the possible applications and show the results for random\nsymmetric matrices and 3-local Hamiltonians with non-negative off-diagonal\nelements.\n", "  We investigate the influence of an external magnetic field on the magnitude\nand dephasing of the transient lateral photovoltaic effect (T-LPE) in\nlithographically patterned Co lines of widths of a few microns grown over\nnaturally passivated p-type Si(100). The T-LPE peak-to-peak magnitude and\ndephasing, measured by lock-in or through the characteristic time of laser OFF\nexponential relaxation, exhibit a notable influence of the magnetization\ndirection of the ferromagnetic overlayer. We show experimentally and by\nnumerical simulations that the T-LPE magnitude is determined by the Co\nanisotropic magnetoresistance. On the other hand, the magnetic field dependence\nof the dephasing could be described by the influence of the Lorentz force\nacting perpendiculary to both the Co magnetization and the photocarrier drift\ndirections. Our findings could stimulate the development of fast position\nsensitive detectors with magnetically tuned magnitude and phase responses.\n", "  We construct a random MERA state with a bond dimension that varies with the\nlevel of the MERA. This causes the state to exhibit a very different\nentanglement structure from that usually seen in MERA, with neighboring\nintervals of length $l$ exhibiting a mutual information proportional to\n$\\epsilon l$ for some constant $\\epsilon$, up to a length scale exponentially\nlarge in $\\epsilon$. We express the entropy of a random MERA in terms of sums\nover cuts through the MERA network, with the entropy in this case controlled by\nthe cut minimizing bond dimensions cut through. One motivation for this\nconstruction is to investigate the tightness of the Brandao-Horodecki\\cite{bh}\nentropy bound relating entanglement to correlation decay. Using the random\nMERA, we show that at least part of the proof is tight: there do exist states\nwith the required property of having linear mutual information between\nneighboring intervals at all length scales. We conjecture that this state has\nexponential correlation decay and that it demonstrates that the\nBrandao-Horodecki bound is tight (at least up to constant factors), and we\nprovide some numerical evidence for this as well as a sketch of how a proof of\ncorrelation decay might proceed.\n", "  We review our models of quantum associative memories that represent the\n\"quantization\" of fully coupled neural networks like the Hopfield model. The\nidea is to replace the classical irreversible attractor dynamics driven by an\nIsing model with pattern-dependent weights by the reversible rotation of an\ninput quantum state onto an output quantum state consisting of a linear\nsuperposition with probability amplitudes peaked on the stored pattern closest\nto the input in Hamming distance, resulting in a high probability of measuring\na memory pattern very similar to the input. The unitary operator implementing\nthis transformation can be formulated as a sequence of one-qubit and two-qubit\nelementary quantum gates and is thus the exponential of an ordered quantum\nIsing model with sequential operations and with pattern-dependent interactions,\nexactly as in the classical case. Probabilistic quantum memories, that make use\nof postselection of the measurement result of control qubits, overcome the\nfamed linear storage limitation of their classical counterparts because they\npermit to completely {\\it eliminate crosstalk and spurious memories}. The\nnumber of control qubits plays the role of an inverse fictitious temperature,\nthe accuracy of pattern retrieval can be tuned by lowering the fictitious\ntemperature under a critical value for quantum content association while the\ncomplexity of the retrieval algorithm remains polynomial for any number of\npatterns polynomial in the number of qubits. These models solve thus the\ncapacity shortage problem of classical associative memories, providing a {\\it\npolynomial improvement} in capacity. The price to pay is the probabilistic\nnature of information retrieval.\n", "  Since the discovery of long-time tails, it has been clear that Fourier's law\nin low dimensions is typically anomalous, with a size-dependent heat\nconductivity, though the nature of the anomaly remains puzzling. The\nconventional wisdom, supported by renormalization-group arguments and\nmode-coupling approximations within fluctuating hydrodynamics, is that the\nanomaly is universal in 1d momentum-conserving systems and belongs in the\nLevy/Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class. Here we challenge this picture by\nusing a novel scaling method to show unambiguously that universality breaks\ndown in the paradigmatic 1d diatomic hard-point fluid. Hydrodynamic profiles\nfor a broad set of gradients, densities and sizes all collapse onto an\nuniversal master curve, showing that (anomalous) Fourier's law holds even deep\ninto the nonlinear regime. This allows to solve the macroscopic transport\nproblem for this model, a solution which compares flawlessly with data and,\ninterestingly, implies the existence of a bound on the heat current in terms of\npressure. These results question the renormalization-group and mode-coupling\nuniversality predictions for anomalous Fourier's law in 1d, offering a new\nperspective on transport in low dimensions.\n", "  By examining the locations of central black holes in two elliptical galaxies,\nM\\,32 and M\\,87, we derive constraints on the violation of the strong\nequivalence principle for purely gravitational objects, i.e. black holes, of\nless than about two-thirds, $\\eta_N<0.68$ from the gravitational interaction of\nM\\,87 with its neighbours in the Virgo cluster. Although M\\,32 appears to be a\ngood candidate for this technique, the high concentration of stars near its\ncentre substantially weakens the constraints. On the other hand, if a central\nblack hole is found in NGC 205 or one of the other satellite ellipticals of\nM\\,31, substantially better constraints could be obtained. In all cases the\nconstraints could improve dramatically with better astrometry.\n", "  We present a generalization of the double semion topological quantum field\ntheory to higher dimensions, as a theory of $d-1$ dimensional surfaces in a $d$\ndimensional ambient space. We construct a local Hamiltonian which is a sum of\ncommuting projectors and analyze the excitations and the ground state\ndegeneracy. Defining a consistent set of local rules requires the sign\nstructure of the ground state wavefunction to depend not just on the number of\ndisconnected surfaces, but also upon their higher Betti numbers through the\nsemicharacteristic. For odd $d$ the theory is related to the toric code by a\nlocal unitary transformation, but for even $d$ the dimension of the space of\nzero energy ground states is in general different from the toric code and for\neven $d>2$ it is also in general different from that of the twisted $Z_2$\nDijkgraaf-Witten model.\n", "  A few years ago, it had been shown that effects stemming from renormalisation\ngroup running can be quite large in the scotogenic model, where neutrinos\nobtain their mass only via a 1-loop diagram (or, more generally, in many models\nin which the light neutrino mass is generated via quantum corrections at\nloop-level). We present a new computation of the renormalisation group\nequations (RGEs) for the scotogenic model, thereby updating previous results.\nWe discuss the matching in detail, in particular in what regards the different\nmass spectra possible for the new particles involved. We furthermore develop\napproximate analytical solutions to the RGEs for an extensive list of\nillustrative cases, covering all general tendencies that can appear in the\nmodel. Comparing them with fully numerical solutions, we give a comprehensive\ndiscussion of the running in the scotogenic model. Our approach is mainly\ntop-down, but we also discuss an attempt to get information on the values of\nthe fundamental parameters when inputting the low-energy measured quantities in\na bottom-up manner. This work serves the basis for a full parameter scan of the\nmodel, thereby relating its low- and high-energy phenomenology, to fully\nexploit the available information.\n", "  Functional Renormalisation Group (FRG) equations are constructed for a simple\nYukawa-model with discrete chiral symmetry, including also the effect of a\nnonzero composite fermion background beyond the conventional scalar condensate.\nThe evolution of the effective potential of the model, generically depending on\ntwo invariants, is explored with help of power series expansions. Systematic\ninvestigation of the effect of a class of irrelevant operators on the lower\n(stability) bound allows a non-perturbative extension of the maximal cut-off\nvalue consistent with any given mass of the scalar field.\n", "  We present our analysis of a system of interacting islands of XY spins on a\ntriangular lattice that has been introduced a few years ago by Eley et al. to\naccount for the phenomenology in experiments on tunable arrays of proximity\ncoupled long superconductor-normal metal-superconductor junctions. The main\nfeatures of the model are the separation of a local and a global interaction\nenergy scale and the mesoscopic character of the spin islands. Upon lowering\nthe temperature the model undergoes two crossovers corresponding to an\nincreasing phase coherence on a single island and to the onset of global\ncoherence across the array; the latter is a thermodynamical phase transition in\nthe Ising universality class. The dependence of the second transition on the\nisland edge-to-edge spacing is related to the proximity-effect of the coupling\nconstant.\n", "  In this paper, we propose a novel data-driven approach for removing trends\n(detrending) from nonstationary, fractal and multifractal time series. We\nconsider real-valued time series relative to measurements of an underlying\ndynamical system that evolves through time. We assume that such a dynamical\nprocess is predictable to a certain degree by means of a class of recurrent\nnetworks called Echo State Network (ESN), which are capable to model a generic\ndynamical process. In order to isolate the superimposed (multi)fractal\ncomponent of interest, we define a data-driven filter by leveraging on the ESN\nprediction capability to identify the trend component of a given input time\nseries. Specifically, the (estimated) trend is removed from the original time\nseries and the residual signal is analyzed with the multifractal detrended\nfluctuation analysis procedure to verify the correctness of the detrending\nprocedure. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed technique,\nwe consider several synthetic time series consisting of different types of\ntrends and fractal noise components with known characteristics. We also process\na real-world dataset, the sunspot time series, which is well-known for its\nmultifractal features and has recently gained attention in the complex systems\nfield. Results demonstrate the validity and generality of the proposed\ndetrending method based on ESNs.\n", "  We calculate diquark correlation functions in the Landau gauge on the lattice\nusing overlap valence quarks and 2+1-flavor domain wall fermion configurations.\nQuark masses are extracted from the scalar part of quark propagators in the\nLandau gauge. Scalar diquark quark mass difference and axial vector scalar\ndiquark mass difference are obtained for diquarks composed of two light quarks\nand of a strange and a light quark. Light sea quark mass dependence of the\nresults is examined. Two lattice spacings are used to check the discretization\neffects. The coarse and fine lattices are of sizes $24^3\\times64$ and\n$32^3\\times64$ with inverse spacings $1/a=1.75(4) {\\rm~GeV}$ and $2.33(5)\n{\\rm~GeV}$, respectively.\n", "  We probe the statistical isotropy hypothesis of the large-scale structure\nwith the second Planck Sunyaev-Zeldovich (PSZ2) galaxy clusters data set. Our\nanalysis adopts a statistical-geometrical method which compares the 2-point\nangular correlation function of objects in antipodal patches of the sky. Given\npossible observational biases, such as the presence of anisotropic sky cuts and\nthe non-uniform exposure of Planck's instrumentation, ensembles of Monte Carlo\nrealisations are produced in order to assess the significance of our results.\nWhen these observational effects are properly taken into account, we find\nneither evidence for preferred directions in the sky nor signs of large-angle\nfeatures in the galaxy clusters celestial distribution. The PSZ2 data set is,\ntherefore, in good concordance with the fundamental hypothesis of large-angle\nisotropy of cosmic objects.\n", "  We study correlation functions of scalar operators on the boundary of the\n$AdS_3$ space deformed by moving massive particles in the context of the\nAdS/CFT duality. To calculate two-point correlation functions we use the\ngeodesic approximation and the renormalized image method. We compare results of\nthe renormalized image method with direct calculations using tracing of winding\ngeodesics around the cone singularities, and show on examples that they are\nequivalent. We demonstrate that in the geodesic approximation the correlators\nexhibit a zone structure. This structure substantially depends on the mass and\nvelocity of the particle.\n", "  Symmetry is a basic paradigm for analysis of problems in solid state physics,\nand to controllably break point-group symmetries is a powerful probe of novel\nforms of order. In this work, we apply two methods, controlled lattice strain\nand vector magnetic field, to study a well-known correlated electron phase that\nappears at low temperatures in the layered material Sr3Ru2O7. This phase\nresponds strongly to C4-symmetry-breaking fields, suggesting spontaneous C4\nsymmetry breaking. However, in this work we find that the data are more easily\nexplained with microscopic coexistence of two orthogonal order parameter\ncomponents than spontaneous symmetry breaking. The techniques presented in this\nwork will be relevant for other systems where spontaneous C4 symmetry breaking\nis suspected.\n", "  Motivated by the recent experiment indicating that superconductivity in the\ndoped topological insulator Cu$_x$Bi$_2$Se$_3$ has an odd-parity pairing\nsymmetry with rotational symmetry breaking, we study the general class of\nodd-parity superconductors with two-component order parameters in trigonal and\nhexagonal crystal systems. In the presence of strong spin-orbit interaction, we\nfind two possible superconducting phases below $T_c$, a time-reversal-breaking\n(i.e., chiral) phase and an anisotropic (i.e., nematic) phase, and determine\ntheir relative energetics from the gap function in momentum space. The nematic\nsuperconductor generally has a full quasi-particle gap, whereas the chiral\nsuperconductor with a three-dimensional (3D) Fermi surface has point nodes with\nlifted spin degeneracy, resulting in itinerant Majorana fermions in the bulk\nand topological Majorana arcs on the surface.\n", "  Supernova neutrinos have several exceptional features which can lead to\ninteresting physical consequences. At the production point their wave packets\nhave an extremely small size $\\sigma_x \\sim 10^{-11}$ cm; hence the energy\nuncertainty can be as large as the energy itself, $\\sigma_E \\sim E$, and the\ncoherence length is short. On the way to the Earth the wave packets of mass\neigenstates spread to macroscopic sizes and separate. Inside the Earth the mass\neigenstates split into eigenstates in matter and oscillate again. The coherence\nlength in the Earth is comparable with the radius of the Earth. We explore\nthese features and their consequences. (i) We present new estimates of the wave\npacket size. (ii) We consider the decoherence condition for the case of wave\npackets with spatial spread and show that it is not modified by the spread.\n(iii) We study the coherence of neutrinos propagating in a multi-layer medium\nwith density jumps at the borders of layers. In this case coherence can be\npartially restored due to a \"catch-up effect\", increasing the coherence length\nbeyond the usual estimate. This catch-up effect can occur for supernova\nneutrinos as they cross the shock wave fronts in the exploding star or the core\nof the Earth.\n", "  We study the charge dynamics of the half-filled Hubbard model on the square\nlattice at zero temperature. We employ a slave-fermion formulation in which the\ncharge degrees of freedom are represented by fermionic holons and doublons and\nthe bosonic spin degrees of freedom are assumed to be described by the\nantiferromagnetic Heisenberg model. The ground state has long-ranged magnetic\n(N\\'eel) order and its Mott-insulating characteristics are the consequence of\nholon-doublon bound-state formation. Within this framework, we calculate the\naverage double occupancy, the electron density of states, and the spectral\nfunction in the self-consistent Born approximation. The lower and upper Hubbard\nbands are reproduced, there is spectral-weight transfer into a coherent\nquasiparticle band at their lower edges, and the Mott gap, associated with\nholon-doublon binding, is renormalized due to the interactions of the holons\nand doublons with the magnons. We compute the zeros of the Green function at\nthe chemical potential to discuss the Luttinger volume and show that the poles\nof the self-energy reflect the underlying quasiparticle dispersion with a\nspin-renormalized hopping parameter. Optical conductivity results relate the\noptical gap to the Mott gap of the insulating system. We conclude that a\nself-consistent treatment of the spin fluctuation effects on the charge degrees\nof freedom captures all the essential physics of the antiferromagnetic\nMott-Hubbard insulator.\n", "  The brightness temperature of the redshifted 21cm line brings rich\ninformation on the Inter Galactic Medium (IGM) from the Cosmic Dawn and Epoch\nof Reionization (EoR). While the power spectrum is a useful tool to\nstatistically investigate the 21cm signal, the 21cm brightness temperature\nfield is highly non-Gaussian, and the power spectrum is inadequate to\ncharacterize the non-Gaussianity. The Minkowski Functionals (MFs) are promising\ntools to extract non-gaussian features of the 21cm signal and give topological\ninformation such as morphology of ionized bubbles. In this work, we study the\n21cm line signal in detail with MFs. To promote understanding of basic features\nof the 21cm signal, we calculate the MFs of not only the hydrogen neutral\nfraction but the matter density and spin temperature, which contribute to the\nbrightness temperature fluctuations. We find that the structure of the\nbrightness temperature depends mainly on the ionized fraction and the spin\ntemperature at late and early stages of the EoR, respectively. Further, we\ninvestigate the redshift evolution of the MFs at $7 < z < 20$. Then, we find\nthat, after the onset of reionization, the MFs reflect mainly the ionized\nbubble property. In addition, the MFs are sensitive to model parameters which\nare related to the topology of ionized bubbles and we consider the possibility\nof constraining the parameters by the future 21cm signal observations.\n", "  A simplified model has previously described the inductive charging of\ncolliding identical grains in the presence of an external electric field. Here\nwe extend that model by including heterogeneous surface charge distributions,\ngrain rotations and electrostatic interactions between grains. We find from\nthis more realistic model that strong heterogeneities in charging can occur in\nagitated granular beds, and we predict that shielding due to these\nheterogeneities can dramatically alter the charging rate in such beds.\n", "  A test of CP invariance in Higgs boson production via vector-boson fusion\nusing the method of the Optimal Observable is presented. The analysis exploits\nthe decay mode of the Higgs boson into a pair of $\\tau$ leptons and is based on\n20.3 fb$^{-1}$ of proton-proton collision data at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 8 TeV collected\nby the ATLAS experiment at the LHC. Contributions from CP-violating\ninteractions between the Higgs boson and electroweak gauge bosons are described\nin an effective field theory framework, in which the strength of CP violation\nis governed by a single parameter $\\tilde{d}$. The mean values and\ndistributions of CP-odd observables agree with the expectation in the Standard\nModel and show no sign of CP violation. The CP-mixing parameter $\\tilde{d}$ is\nconstrained to the interval [-0.11,0.05] at 68% confidence level, consistent\nwith the Standard Model expectation of $\\tilde{d}=0$.\n", "  Quantum state estimation aims at determining the quantum state from observed\ndata. Estimating the full state can require considerable efforts, but one is\noften only interested in a few properties of the state, such as the fidelity\nwith a target state, or the degree of correlation for a specified bipartite\nstructure. Rather than first estimating the state, one can, and should,\nestimate those quantities of interest directly from the data. We propose the\nuse of optimal error intervals as a meaningful way of stating the accuracy of\nthe estimated property values. Optimal error intervals are analogs of the\noptimal error regions for state estimation [New J. Phys. 15, 123026 (2013)].\nThey are optimal in two ways: They have the largest likelihood for the observed\ndata and the pre-chosen size, and are the smallest for the pre-chosen\nprobability of containing the true value. As in the state situation, such\noptimal error intervals admit a simple description in terms of the marginal\nlikelihood for the data for the properties of interest. Here, we present the\nconcept and construction of optimal error intervals, report on an iterative\nalgorithm for reliable computation of the marginal likelihood (a quantity\ndifficult to calculate reliably), explain how plausible intervals --- a notion\nof evidence provided by the data --- are related to our optimal error\nintervals, and illustrate our methods with single-qubit and two-qubit examples.\n", "  Recently, the negatively charged silicon vacancy centre (SiV) in diamond has\nemerged as a novel promising system for quantum information processing (QIP)\ndue to its superior spectral properties and advantageous electronic structure:\nThe SiV offers an optically accessible {\\Lambda}-type level structure with a\nlarge orbital level splitting even without the need of an external magnetic\nfield and previous studies determined the ground state coherence time of the\ncentre to be on the order of 35-45ns. While these studies already indicate the\nfeasibility of an ultrafast all-optical coherent control of the SiV, no\nexperimental realization has been presented so far. Here, we report on optical\nRabi oscillations and Ramsey interference between the ground and the excited\nstate of the SiV using 12 ps long, resonant rotation pulses. Moreover,\nutilizing a {\\Lambda}-scheme, we demonstrate Raman-based coherent Rabi\nrotations and Ramsey interference within the ground state manifold using a\nsingle, 1ps long off-resonant pulse. These measurements prove the accessibility\nof the complete set of single-qubit operations relying solely on optical fields\nand pave the way for high-speed QIP applications using SiV centres.\n", "  The production of $W$ boson pairs in proton-proton collisions at $\\sqrt{s}=$\n8 TeV is studied using data corresponding to 20.3 fb$^{-1}$ of integrated\nluminosity collected by the ATLAS detector during 2012 at the CERN Large Hadron\nCollider. The $W$ bosons are reconstructed using their leptonic decays into\nelectrons or muons and neutrinos. Events with reconstructed jets are not\nincluded in the candidate event sample. A total of 6636 $WW$ candidate events\nare observed. Measurements are performed in fiducial regions closely\napproximating the detector acceptance. The integrated measurement is corrected\nfor all acceptance effects and for the $W$ branching fractions to leptons in\norder to obtain the total $WW$ production cross section, which is found to be\n71.1$\\pm1.1$(stat)$^{+5.7}_{-5.0}$(syst)$\\pm1.4$ pb. This agrees with the\nnext-to-next-to-leading-order Standard Model prediction of\n63.2$^{+1.6}_{-1.4}$(scale)$\\pm1.2$(PDF) pb. Fiducial differential cross\nsections are measured as a function of each of six kinematic variables. The\ndistribution of the transverse momentum of the leading lepton is used to set\nlimits on anomalous triple-gauge-boson couplings.\n", "  We provide generalized entanglement constraints in multi-qubit systems in\nterms of Tsallis entropy. Using quantum Tsallis entropy of order $q$, we first\nprovide a generalized monogamy inequality of multi-qubit entanglement for $q=2$\nor $3$. This generalization encapsulates multi-qubit CKW-type inequality as a\nspecial case. We further provide a generalized polygamy inequality of\nmulti-qubit entanglement in terms of Tsallis-$q$ entropy for $1 \\leq q \\leq2$\nor $3 \\leq q \\leq 4$, which also contains the multi-qubit polygamy inequality\nas a special case.\n", "  Recent nuclear magnetic resonance and specific heat measurements have\nprovided concurring evidence of spontaneously broken rotational symmetry in the\nsuperconducting state of the doped topological insulator Cu$_x$Bi$_2$Se$_3$.\nThis suggests that the pairing symmetry corresponds to a two-dimensional\nrepresentation of the $D_{3d}$ crystal point group, and that Cu$_x$Bi$_2$Se$_3$\nis a nematic superconductor. In this work, we present a comprehensive study of\nthe upper critical field $H_{c2}$ of nematic superconductors within\nGinzburg-Landau (GL) theory. Contrary to typical GL theories which have an\nemergent U(1) rotational symmetry obscuring the discrete symmetry of the\ncrystal, the theory of two-component superconductors in trigonal crystals\nreflects the true $D_{3d}$ crystal symmetry. This has direct implications for\nthe upper critical field. First, $H_{c2}$ of trigonal superconductors exhibits\na sixfold anisotropy in the basal plane. Second, when the degeneracy of the two\ncomponents is lifted by, e.g., uniaxial strain, $H_{c2}$ exhibits a twofold\nanisotropy with characteristic angle and temperature dependence. Our thorough\nstudy shows that measurement of the upper critical field is a direct method of\ndetecting nematic superconductivity, which is directly applicable to\nrecently-discovered trigonal superconductors Cu$_x$Bi$_2$Se$_3$,\nSr$_x$Bi$_2$Se$_3$, Nb$_x$Bi$_2$Se$_3$, and Tl$_x$Bi$_2$Se$_3$.\n", "  GeSe and SnSe monochalcogenide monolayers and bilayers undergo a\ntwo-dimensional phase transition from a rectangular unit cell to a square unit\ncell at a temperature $T_c$ well below the melting point. Its consequences on\nmaterial properties are studied within the framework of Car-Parrinello\nmolecular dynamics and density-functional theory. No in-gap states develop as\nthe structural transition takes place, so that these phase-change materials\nremain semiconducting below and above $T_c$. As the in-plane lattice transforms\nfrom a rectangle onto a square at $T_c$, the electronic, spin, optical, and\npiezo-electric properties dramatically depart from earlier predictions. Indeed,\nthe $Y-$ and $X-$points in the Brillouin zone become effectively equivalent at\n$T_c$, leading to a symmetric electronic structure. The spin polarization at\nthe conduction valley edge vanishes, and the hole conductivity must display an\nanomalous thermal increase at $T_c$. The linear optical absorption band edge\nmust change its polarization as well, making this structural and electronic\nevolution verifiable by optical means. Much excitement has been drawn by\ntheoretical predictions of giant piezo-electricity and ferroelectricity in\nthese materials, and we estimate a pyroelectric response of about $3\\times\n10^{-12}$ $C/K m$ here. These results uncover the fundamental role of\ntemperature as a control knob for the physical properties of few-layer group-IV\nmonochalcogenides\n", "  At low temperatures, in very clean two-dimensional (2D) samples the electron\nmean free path for collisions with static defects and phonons becomes greater\nthan the sample width. Under this condition, the electron transport occurs by\nformation of a viscous flow of an electron fluid. We study the viscous flow of\n2D electrons in a magnetic field perpendicular to the 2D layer. We calculate\nthe viscosity coefficients as the functions of magnetic field and temperature.\nThe off-diagonal viscosity coefficient determines the dispersion of the 2D\nhydrodynamic waves. The decrease of the diagonal viscosity in magnetic field\nleads to negative magnetoresistance which is temperature- and size dependent.\nOur analysis demonstrates that the viscous mechanism is responsible for the\ngiant negative magnetoresistance recently observed in the ultra-high-mobility\nGaAs quantum wells. We conclude that 2D electrons in that structures in\nmoderate magnetic fields should be treated as a viscous fluid.\n", "  A numerical evidence for the universality of the bound-zone peculiar velocity\nprofile in a LambdaCDM universe is presented. Analyzing the dark matter halo\ncatalogs from the Millennium-II simulation, we determine the average peculiar\nvelocity profiles of the objects located in the bound zones around massive\ngroup-size halos at various redshifts and compare them to an analytic formula\ncharacterized by two parameters, the amplitude and slope of the profile. The\nbest-fit values of the two parameters are found to be robust against the\nchanges of the mass scales and the key cosmological parameters. It is also\nfound that the amplitude and slope parameters of the bound-zone peculiar\nvelocity profile are constant but only in the limited ranges of redshifts. In\nthe dark matter dominated epoch corresponding to z> 0.6 the two parameters have\nconstant values. In the transition period corresponding to 0.2=< z=< 0.6 when\nthe density of Lambda begins to exceed that of dark matter the two parameters\ngrow almost linearly with redshifts. At later epochs z<0.2 when the\nLambda-domination prevails the two parameters regain constancy settling upon\nhigher constant values. Noting that the length of the transition period depends\non the amount of Lambda and speculating that the linear evolution of the\nprofile with redshifts in the transition period is a unique feature of the\nLambda-dominated universe, we suggest that the redshift evolution of the\nbound-zone peculiar velocity profile should be a powerful local discriminator\nof dark energy candidates.\n", "  Measurements of particle emission from a replica of the T2K 90 cm-long carbon\ntarget were performed in the NA61/SHINE experiment at CERN SPS, using data\ncollected during a high-statistics run in 2009. An efficient use of the\nlong-target measurements for neutrino flux predictions in T2K requires\ndedicated reconstruction and analysis techniques. Fully-corrected differential\nyields of $\\pi^\\pm$-mesons from the surface of the T2K replica target for\nincoming 31 GeV/c protons are presented. A possible strategy to implement these\nresults into the T2K neutrino beam predictions is discussed and the propagation\nof the uncertainties of these results to the final neutrino flux is performed.\n", "  The gravitational field of the sun will focus light from a distant source to\na focal point at a minimal distance of 550 Astronomical Units from the sun. A\nproposed mission to this gravitational focus could use the sun as a very large\nlens, allowing (in principle) a large amplification of signal from the target,\nand a very high magnification. This article discusses some of the difficulties\ninvolved in using the sun as such a gravitational telescope for a candidate\nmission, that of imaging the surface of a previously-detected exoplanet. These\ndifficulties include the pointing and focal length, and associated high\nmagnification; the signal to noise ratio associated with the solar corona, and\nthe focal blur. In addition, a method to calculate the signal gain and\nmagnification is derived using the first-order deflection calculation and\nclassical optics, showing that the gain is finite for an on-axis source of\nnon-zero area.\n", "  With the advent of Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs), PUF-based quantum\nauthentication systems (QAS) have been proposed for security purposes and\nrecently proof-of-principle experiment has been demonstrated. As a further step\ntowards completing the security analysis, we investigate quantum cloning\nattacks against PUF-based quantum authentication systems and prove that quantum\ncloning attacks outperform the so-called challenge-estimation attacks. We\npresent the analytical expression of the false accept probability by use of the\ncorresponding optimal quantum cloning machines and extend the previous results\nin the literature. In light of these findings, an explicit comparison is made\nbetween PUF-based quantum authentication systems and quantum key distribution\n(QKD) protocols in the context of cloning attacks. Moreover, from an\nexperimental perspective, a trade-off between the average photon number and the\ndetection efficiency is discussed in detail.\n", "  Quantum correlations represent a fundamental tool for studies ranging from\nbasic science to quantum technologies. Different non-classical correlations\nhave been identified and studied, as entanglement and discord. In view of\nfuture applications in this letter we explore experimentally the rich geometry\nof Bell-diagonal states, measuring the values of entanglement and discord and\nhighlighting the effect of decoherence in real experiments.\n", "  An analytical solution of the Mott transition is obtained for the Hubbard\nmodel on the Bethe lattice in the large coordination number ($z$) limit. The\nexcitonic binding of doublons (doubly occupied sites) and holons (empty sites)\nis shown to be the origin of a continuous Mott transition between a metal and\nan emergent quantum spin liquid insulator. The doublon-holon binding theory\nenables a different large-$z$ limit and a different phase structure than the\ndynamical meanfield theory by allowing intersite spinon correlations to lift\nthe $2^N$-fold degeneracy of the local moments in the insulating phase. We show\nthat the spinons are coupled to doublons/holons by a dissipative compact U(1)\ngauge field that is in the deconfined phase, stabilizing the spin-charge\nseparated gapless spin liquid Mott insulator.\n", "  Classical string actions in AdS(3) and dS(3) can be connected to the\nsinh-Gordon and cosh-Gordon equations through Pohlmeyer reduction. We show that\nthe problem of constructing a classical string solution with a given static or\ntranslationally invariant Pohlmeyer counterpart is equivalent to solving four\npairs of effective Schrodinger problems. Each pair consists of a flat potential\nand an n = 1 Lame potential whose eigenvalues are connected, and, additionally,\nthe four solutions satisfy a set of constraints. An approach for solving this\nsystem is developed by employing an interesting connection between the specific\nclass of classical string solutions and the band structure of the Lame\npotential. This method is used for the construction of several families of\nclassical string solutions, one of which turns out to be the spiky strings in\nAdS(3). New solutions include circular rotating strings in AdS(3) with singular\ntime evolution of their radius and angular velocity as well as classical string\nsolutions in dS(3).\n", "  We introduce a general framework for the construction of completely positive\ndynamical evolutions in the presence of system-environment initial\ncorrelations. The construction relies upon commutativity of the compatibility\ndomain obtained by considering the marginals with respect to the environmental\ndegrees of freedom of the considered class of correlated states. Our approach\nallows to consider states whose discord is not necessarily zero and explicitly\nshow the non-uniqueness of the completely positive extensions of the obtained\ndynamical map outside the compatibility domain. The relevance of such maps for\nthe treatment of open quantum system dynamics is discussed and connection to\nprevious literature is critically assessed.\n", "  In this paper we have studied thermodynamics of a black hole in massive\ngravity in the canonical ensemble. The massive gravity theory in consideration\nhere has a massive graviton due to Lorentz symmetry breaking. The black hole\nstudied here has a scalar charge due to the massive graviton and is\nasymptotically anti-de Sitter. We have computed various thermodynamical\nquantities such as temperature, specific heat and free energy. Both the local\nand global stability of the black hole are studied by observing the behavior of\nthe specific heat and the free energy. We have observed that there is a first\norder phase transition between small and large black hole for a certain range\nof the scalar charge. This phase transition is similar to the liquid/gas phase\ntransition at constant temperature for a Van der Waals fluid. The coexistence\ncurves for the small and large black hole branches are also discussed in\ndetail.\n", "  We revisit AdS$_2$ holography with the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev models in mind. Our\nmain result is to rewrite a generic theory of gravity near an AdS$_2$ throat as\na novel hydrodynamics coupled to the correlation functions of a conformal\nquantum mechanics. This gives a prescription for the computation of $n$-point\nfunctions in the dual quantum mechanics. We thereby find that the dual is\nmaximally chaotic.\n", "  The portfolio optimization problem in which the variances of the return rates\nof assets are not identical is analyzed in this paper using the methodology of\nstatistical mechanical informatics, specifically, replica analysis. We define\ntwo characteristic quantities of an optimal portfolio, namely, minimal\ninvestment risk and concentrated investment level, in order to solve the\nportfolio optimization problem and analytically determine their asymptotical\nbehaviors using replica analysis. Moreover, numerical experiments were\nperformed, and a comparison between the results of our simulation and those\nobtained via replica analysis validated our proposed method.\n", "  In continuous-variable tomography, with finite data and limited computation\nresources, reconstruction of a quantum state of light is performed on a\nfinite-dimensional subspace. No systematic method was ever developed to assign\nsuch a reconstruction subspace---only ad hoc methods that rely on\nhard-to-certify assumptions about the source and strategies. We provide a\nstraightforward and numerically feasible procedure to uniquely determine the\nappropriate reconstruction subspace for any given unknown quantum state of\nlight and measurement scheme. This procedure makes use of the celebrated\nstatistical principle of maximum likelihood, along with other validation tools,\nto grow an appropriate seed subspace into the optimal reconstruction subspace,\nmuch like the nucleation of a seed into a crystal. Apart from using the\navailable measurement data, no other spurious assumptions about the source or\nad hoc strategies are invoked. As a result, there will no longer be\nreconstruction artifacts present in state reconstruction, which is a usual\nconsequence of a bad choice of reconstruction subspace. The procedure can be\nunderstood as the maximum-likelihood reconstruction for quantum subspaces,\nwhich is an analog to, and fully compatible with that for quantum states.\n", "  Fullerene complexes may play a key role in the design of future molecular\nelectronics and nanostructured devices with potential applications in light\nharvesting using organic solar cells. Charge and energy flow in these systems\nis mediated by many-body effects. We studied the structure and dynamics of\nlaser-induced multi-electron excitations in isolated C$_{60}$ by two-photon\nphotoionization as a function of excitation wavelength using a tunable fs UV\nlaser and developed a corresponding theoretical framework on the basis of\n\\emph{ab initio} calculations. The measured resonance line width gives direct\ninformation on the excited state lifetime. From the spectral deconvolution we\nderive a lower limit for purely electronic relaxation on the order of\n$\\tau_\\mathrm{el}=10^{+5}_{-3}$ fs. Energy dissipation towards nuclear degrees\nof freedom is studied in time-resolved techniques. The evaluation of the\nnon-linear autocorrelation trace gives a characteristic time constant of\n$\\tau_\\mathrm{vib}=400\\pm100$ fs for the exponential decay. In line with the\nexperiment, the observed transient dynamics is explained theoretically by\nnonadiabatic (vibronic) couplings involving the correlated electronic, the\nnuclear degrees of freedom (accounting for the Herzberg-Teller coupling), and\ntheir interplay.\n", "  The periodic Anderson model (PAM) is studied within the framework of\ndynamical mean-field theory, with particular emphasis on the interaction-driven\nMott transition it contains, and on resultant Mott insulators of both\nMott-Hubbard and charge-transfer type. The form of the PAM phase diagram is\nfirst deduced on general grounds using two exact results, over the full range\nof model parameters and including metallic, Mott, Kondo and band insulator\nphases.The effective low-energy model which describes the PAM in the vicinity\nof a Mott transition is then shown to be a one-band Hubbard model, with\neffective hoppings that are not in general solely nearest neighbour, but decay\nexponentially with distance. This mapping is shown to have a range of\nimplications for the physics of the problem, from phase boundaries to\nsingle-particle dynamics; all of which are confirmed and supplemented by NRG\ncalculations. Finally we consider the locally degenerate, non-Fermi liquid Mott\ninsulator, to describe which requires a two-self-energy description. This is\nshown to yield a number of exact results for the associated local moment,\ncharge, and interaction-renormalised levels, together with a generalisation of\nLuttinger's theorem to the Mott insulator.\n", "  Spatial gradients of diffusible signalling molecules play crucial roles in\ncontrolling diverse cellular behaviour such as cell differentiation, tissue\npatterning and chemotaxis. In this paper, we report the design and testing of a\nmicrofluidic device for diffusion-based gradient generation for cellular\nassays. A unique channel design of the device eliminates cross-flow between the\nsource and sink channels, thereby stabilising gradients by passive diffusion.\nThe platform also enables quick and flexible control of chemical concentration\nthat makes highly dynamic gradients in diffusion chambers. A model with the\nfirst approximation of diffusion and surface adsorption of molecules\nrecapitulates the experimentally observed gradients. Budding yeast cells\ncultured in a gradient of a chemical inducer expressed a reporter fluorescence\nprotein in a concentration-dependent manner. This microfluidic platform serves\nas a versatile prototype applicable to a broad range of biomedical\ninvestigations.\n", "  As we anticipate the first results of the 2016 run, we assess the discovery\npotential of the LHC to `natural supersymmetry'. To begin with, we explore the\nregion of the model parameter space that can be excluded with various\ncentre-of-mass energies (13 TeV and 14 TeV) and different luminosities (20\nfb$^{-1}$, 100 fb$^{-1}$, 300 fb$^{-1}$ and 3000 fb$^{-1}$). We find that the\nbounds at 95% CL on stops vary from $m_{\\tilde{t}_1}\\gtrsim 900$ GeV expected\nthis summer to $m_{\\tilde{t}_1}\\gtrsim 1500$ GeV at the end of the high\nluminosity run, while gluino bounds are expected to range from\n$m_{\\tilde{g}}\\gtrsim 1700$ GeV to $m_{\\tilde{g}}\\gtrsim 2500$ GeV over the\nsame time period. However, more pessimistically we find that if no signal\nbegins to appear this summer, only a very small region of parameter space can\nbe discovered with 5-$\\sigma$ significance. For this conclusion to change, we\nfind that both theoretical and systematic uncertainties will need to be\nsignificantly reduced.\n", "  We experimentally demonstrate coupling of an atomically thin, free-standing\ngraphene membrane to an optical cavity. By changing the position of the\nmembrane along the standing-wave field of the cavity we tailor the dissipative\ncoupling between the membrane and the cavity, and we show that the dissipative\ncoupling can outweigh the dispersive coupling. Such a system, for which\ncontrolled dissipation prevails dispersion, will prove useful for novel\nlaser-cooling schemes in optomechanics. In addition, we have determined the\ncontinuous-wave optical damage threshold of free-standing monolayer graphene of\n1.8(4)~MW/cm$^2$ at 780nm.\n", "  In our high mobility p-type AlGaAs/GaAs two-dimensional hole samples, we\noriginally observe the B-periodic oscillation induced by microwave (MW) in\nphotovoltage (PV) measurements. In the frequency range of our measurements (5 -\n40 GHz), the period ({\\Delta}B) is inversely proportional to the microwave\nfrequency (f). The distinct oscillations come from the edge magnetoplasmon\n(EMP) in the high quality heavy hole system. In our hole sample with a very\nlarge effective mass, the observation of the EMP oscillations is in neither the\nlow frequency limit nor the high frequency limit, and the damping of the EMP\noscillations is very weak under high magnetic fields. Simultaneously, we\nobserve the giant plasmon resonance signals in our measurements on the shallow\ntwo-dimensional hole system (2DHS).\n", "  We study the properties of classical vortex solutions in a non-Abelian gauge\ntheory. A system of two adjoint Higgs fields breaks the SU(2) gauge symmetry to\n$Z_2$, producing 't Hooft-Polyakov monopoles trapped on cosmic strings, termed\nbeads; there are two charges of monopole and two degenerate string solutions.\nThe strings break an accidental discrete $Z_2$ symmetry of the theory,\nexplaining the degeneracy of the ground state. Further symmetries of the model,\nnot previously appreciated, emerge when the masses of the two adjoint Higgs\nfields are degenerate. The breaking of the enlarged discrete symmetry gives\nrise to additional string solutions and splits the monopoles into four types of\n`semipole': kink solutions that interpolate between the string solutions,\nclassified by a complex gauge invariant magnetic flux and a $Z_4$ charge. At\nspecial values of the Higgs self-couplings, the accidental symmetry broken by\nthe string is continuous, giving rise to supercurrents on the strings. The\nSU(2) theory can be embedded in a wide class of Grand Unified Theories,\nincluding SO(10). We argue that semipoles and supercurrents are generic on GUT\nstrings.\n", "  We study fully three-dimensional droplets that slide down an incline by\nemploying a thin-film equation that accounts for capillarity, wettability, and\na lateral driving force in small-gradient (or long-wave) approximation. In\nparticular, we focus on qualitative changes in the morphology and behavior of\nstationary sliding drops. We employ the inclination angle of the substrate as\ncontrol parameter and use continuation techniques to analyze for several fixed\ndroplet sizes the bifurcation diagram of stationary droplets, their linear\nstability, and relevant eigenmodes. The obtained predictions on existence\nranges and instabilities are tested via direct numerical simulations that are\nalso used to investigate a branch of time-periodic behavior (corresponding to\nrepeated breakup-coalescence cycles, where the breakup is also denoted as\npearling) which emerges at a global instability, the related hysteresis in\nbehavior, and a period-doubling cascade. The nontrivial oscillatory behavior\nclose to a Hopf bifurcation of drops with a finite-length tail is also studied.\nFinally, it is shown that the main features of the bifurcation diagram follow\nscaling laws over several decades of the droplet size.\n", "  We provide a Hilbert manifold structure {\\`a} la Bartnik for the space of\nasymptotically hyperbolic initial data for the vacuum constraint equations. The\nadaptation led us to prove new weighted Poincar{\\'e} and Korn type inequalities\nfor AH manifolds with inner boundary and weakly regular metric.\n", "  We investigate the effect of meson loops on the spectrum of quark states. We\ndemonstrate that in general quark states do not tend to get very broad if their\ncoupling to the continuum increases, but instead they decouple from the latter\nin the large coupling limit. We ascribe this effect to the essentially\nnonperturbative unitarization procedure involved. In the meantime, some quark\nresonances behave very differently and demonstrate collectivity in the sense\nthat their pole trajectories span a wide, as compared to the level spacing,\nregion therefore acquiring contributions from multiple bare poles rather than\nfrom the closest neighbors. While the actual calculations are done within\nparticular, very simplified models, it is argued that the findings might well\nbe general.\n", "  The ability to perform computations on encrypted data is a powerful tool for\nprotecting a client's privacy, especially in today's era of cloud and\ndistributed computing. In terms of privacy, the best solutions that classical\ntechniques can achieve are unfortunately not unconditionally secure in the\nsense that they are dependent on a hacker's computational power. Here we\ntheoretically investigate, and experimentally demonstrate with Gaussian\ndisplacement and squeezing operations, a quantum solution that achieves the\nunconditional security of a user's privacy using the practical technology of\ncontinuous variables. We demonstrate losses of up to 10 km both ways between\nthe client and the server and show that security can still be achieved. Our\napproach offers a number of practical benefits, which can ultimately allow for\nthe potential widespread adoption of this quantum technology in future\ncloud-based computing networks.\n", "  When a plate is withdrawn from a liquid bath, either a static meniscus forms\nin the transition region between the bath and the substrate or a liquid film of\nfinite thickness (a Landau-Levich film) is transferred onto the moving\nsubstrate. If the substrate is inhomogeneous, e.g., has a prestructure\nconsisting of stripes of different wettabilities, the meniscus can be deformed\nor show a complex dynamic behavior. Here we study the free surface shape and\ndynamics of a dragged meniscus occurring for striped prestructures with two\norientations, parallel and perpendicular to the transfer direction. A thin film\nmodel is employed that accounts for capillarity through a Laplace pressure and\nfor the spatially varying wettability through a Derjaguin (or disjoining)\npressure. Numerical continuation is used to obtain steady free surface profiles\nand corresponding bifurcation diagrams in the case of substrates with different\nhomogeneous wettabilities. Direct numerical simulations are employed in the\ncase of the various striped prestructures. The final part illustrates the\nimportance of our findings for particular applications that involve complex\nliquids by modeling a Langmuir-Blodgett transfer experiment. There, one\ntransfers a monolayer of an insoluble surfactant that covers the surface of the\nbath onto the moving substrate. The resulting pattern formation phenomena can\nbe crucially influenced by the hydrodynamics of the liquid meniscus that itself\ndepends on the prestructure on the substrate. In particular, we show how\nprestructure stripes parallel to the transfer direction lead to the formation\nof bent stripes in the surfactant coverage after transfer and present similar\nexperimental results.\n", "  A theoretical model is presented which provides a way to simulate, at a very\nabstract level, power struggles in the social world. In the model, agents can\nbenefit or harm each other, to varying degrees and with differing levels of\ninfluence. The agents interact over time, using the power they have to try to\nget more of it, while being constrained in their strategic choices by social\ninertia. The outcomes of the model are probabilistic. More research is needed\nto determine whether the model has any empirical validity.\n", "  A bound-violation designates a case that the turn-around radius of a bound\nobject exceeds the upper limit put by the spherical collapse model based on the\nstandard $\\Lambda$CDM paradigm. Given that the turn-around radius of a bound\nobject is a stochastic quantity and that the spherical model overly simplifies\nthe true gravitational collapse which actually proceeds anisotropically along\nthe cosmic web, the rarity of the occurrence of a bound violation may depend on\nthe web environment. Assuming a Planck cosmology, we numerically construct the\nbound-zone peculiar velocity profiles along the cosmic web (filaments and\nsheets) around the isolated groups with virial mass $M_{\\rm v}\\ge 3\\times\n10^{13}\\,h^{-1}M_{\\odot}$ identified in the Small MultiDark Planck simulations\nand determine the radial distances at which their peculiar velocities equal the\nHubble expansion speed as the turn-around radii of the groups. It is found that\nalthough the average turn-around radii of the isolated groups are well below\nthe spherical bound-limit on all mass scales, the bound violations are not\nforbidden for individual groups and that the cosmic web has an effect of\nreducing the rarity of the occurrence of a bound violation. Explaining that the\nspherical bound limit on the turn-around radius in fact represents the\nthreshold distance up to which the intervention of the external gravitational\nfield in the bound-zone peculiar velocity profiles around the non-isolated\ngroups stays negligible, we discuss the possibility of using the threshold\ndistance scale to constrain locally the equation of state of dark energy .\n", "  We examine in this paper the stability analysis in $f(R; T;\nR_{\\mu\\nu}T^{\\mu\\nu})$ modified gravity, where $R$ and $T$ are the Ricci scalar\nand the trace of the energy-momentum tensor, respectively. By considering the\nflat Friedmann universe, we obtain the corresponding generalized Friedmann\nequations and we evaluate the geometrical and matter perturbation functions.\nThe stability is developed using the de Sitter and power-law solutions. We\nsearch for application the stability of two particular cases of $f(R; T;\nR_{\\mu\\nu}T^{\\mu\\nu})$ model by solving numerically the perturbation functions\nobtained.\n", "  While Carnot's model engines demonstrate ideal performances regarding\nconversion efficiency, they cannot be actually used as energy converters since\nthey are non causal systems. Such an unphysical behavior indeed restrains the\nworking conditions to a single point where, in the case of a refrigerator\n(generator), the cooling power (output power) vanishes. Focusing on the example\nof a thermoelectric refrigerator, we study the impact of different dissipation\nsources on the causality of such systems. Basing our analysis on the block\ndiagram description of this system, we discuss particularly the fact that heat\nconduction cannot ensure causality.\n", "  We analyze the spin anisotropy of the magnetic susceptibility of Sr$_2$RuO$4$\nin presence of spin-orbit coupling and anisotropic strain using\nquasi-two-dimensional tight-binding parametrization fitted to the ARPES\nresults. Similar to the previous observations we find the in-plane polarization\nof the low ${\\bf q}$ magnetic fluctuations and the out-of-plane polarization of\nthe incommensurate magnetic fluctuation at the nesting wave vector ${\\bf Q}_1 =\n(2/3 \\pi ,2/3 \\pi)$ but also nearly isotropic fluctuations near ${\\bf\nQ}_2=(\\pi/6,\\pi/6)$. Furthermore, one finds that apart from the high-symmetry\ndirection of the tetragonal Brillouin zone the magnetic anisotropy is maximal,\ni.e. $\\chi^{xx} \\neq \\chi^{yy} \\neq \\chi^{zz}$. This is the consequence of the\norbital anisotropy of the $xz$ and $yz$ orbitals in the momentum space. We also\nstudy how the magnetic anisotropy evolves in the presence of the strain and\nfind strong Ising-like ferromagnetic fluctuations near the Lifshitz transition\nfor the $xy$-band.\n", "  Work fluctuation and total entropy production play crucial roles in small\nthermodynamic systems subject to large thermal fluctuations. We investigate a\ntrade-off relation between them in a nonequilibrium situation in which a system\nstarts from an arbitrary nonequilibrium state. We apply the variational method\nto study this problem and find a stationary solution against variations over\nprotocols that describe the time dependence of the Hamiltonian of the system.\nUsing the stationary solution, we find the minimum of the total entropy\nproduction for a given amount of work fluctuation. An explicit protocol that\nachieves this is constructed from an adiabatic process followed by a\nquasi-static process. The obtained results suggest how one can control the\nnonequilibrium dynamics of the system while suppressing its work fluctuation\nand total entropy production.\n", "  We have observed momentum- and position-resolved spectra and images of the\nphotoluminescence from thermalised and condensed dye-microcavity photons. The\nspectra yield the dispersion relation and the potential energy landscape for\nthe photons. From this dispersion relation, we find that the effective mass is\nthat of a free photon not a polariton. We place an upper bound on the\ndimensionless two-dimensional interaction strength of $\\tilde{g}\\lesssim\n10^{-3}$, which is compatible with existing estimates. Both photon-photon and\nphoton-molecule interactions are weak. The temperature is found to be\nindependent of momentum, but dependent on pump spot size, indicating that the\nsystem is ergodic but not perfectly at thermal equilibrium. Condensation always\nhappens first in the mode with lowest potential and lowest kinetic energy,\nalthough at very high pump powers multimode condensation occurs into other\nmodes.\n", "  Dynamical chiral symmetry breaking (D$\\chi$SB) is studied within\n($2+1$)-dimensional QED with $N$ four-component fermions. The leading and\nnext-to-leading orders of the $1/N$ expansion are computed exactly. The\nanalysis is carried out in an arbitrary non-local gauge. Resumming the\nwave-function renormalization constant at the level of the gap equation yields\na strong suppression of the gauge dependence of the critical fermion flavour\nnumber, $N_c(\\xi)$ where $\\xi$ is the gauge fixing parameter, which is such\nthat D$\\chi$SB takes place for $N<N_c(\\xi)$. Neglecting the weak\ngauge-dependent terms yields $N_c = 2.8469$ while, in the general case, it is\nfound that: $N_c(1) = 3.0084$ in the Feynman gauge, $N_c(0) = 3.0844$ in the\nLandau gauge and $N_c(2/3)= 3.0377$ in the $\\xi=2/3$ gauge where the leading\norder fermion wave function is finite. These results suggest that D$\\chi$SB\nshould take place for integer values $N \\leq 3$.\n", "  The dynamical generation of a fermion gap in graphene is studied at the\ninfra-red Lorentz-invariant fixed point where the system is described by an\neffective relativistic-like field theory: reduced QED$_{4,3}$ with $N$ four\ncomponent fermions ($N=2$ for graphene), where photons are $(3+1)$-dimensional\nand mediate a fully retarded interaction among $(2+1)$-dimensional fermions. A\ncorrespondence between reduced QED$_{4,3}$ and QED$_3$ allows us to derive an\nexact gap equation for QED$_{4,3}$ up to next-to-leading order. Our results\nshow that a dynamical gap is generated for $\\alpha > \\alpha_c$ where $1.03 <\n\\alpha_c < 1.08$ in the case $N=2$ or for $N < N_c$ where $N_c$ is such that\n$\\alpha_c \\to \\infty$ and takes the values $3.24 < N_c < 3.36$. The striking\nfeature of these results is that they are in good agreement with values found\nin models with instantaneous Coulomb interaction. At the fixed point: $\\alpha =\n1/137 \\ll \\alpha_c$, and the system is therefore in the semi-metallic regime in\naccordance with experiments.\n", "  We generalize the ordinary aggregation process to allow for choice. In\nordinary aggregation, two random clusters merge and form a larger aggregate. In\nour implementation of choice, a target cluster and two candidate clusters are\nrandomly selected, and the target cluster merges with the larger of the two\ncandidate clusters. We study the long-time asymptotic behavior, and find that\nas in ordinary aggregation, the size density adheres to the standard scaling\nform. However, aggregation with choice exhibits a number of novel features.\nFirst, the density of the smallest clusters exhibits anomalous scaling. Second,\nboth the small-size and the large-size tails of the density are overpopulated,\nat the expense of the density moderate-size clusters. We also study the\ncomplementary case where the smaller candidate clusters participates in the\naggregation process, and find abundance of moderate clusters at the expense of\nsmall and large clusters. Additionally, we investigate aggregation processes\nwith choice among multiple candidate clusters, and a symmetric implementation\nwhere the choice is between two pairs of clusters.\n", "  The extended quasidilaton theory is one of the simplest Lorentz-invariant\nmassive gravity theories which can accommodate a stable self-accelerating\nvacuum solution. In this paper we revisit this theory and study the effect of\nmatter fields. For a matter sector that couples minimally to the physical\nmetric, we find hints of a Jeans type instability in the IR. In the analogue\nk-essence field set-up, this instability manifests itself as an IR ghost for\nthe scalar field perturbation, but this can be interpreted as a classical\ninstability that becomes relevant below some momentum scale in terms of matter\ndensity perturbations. We also consider the effect of the background evolution\ninfluenced by matter on the stability of the gravity sector perturbations. In\nparticular, we address the previous claims of ghost instability in the IR\naround the late time attractor. We show that, although the matter-induced\nmodification of the evolution potentially brings tension to the stability\nconditions, one goes beyond the regime of validity of the effective theory well\nbefore the solutions become unstable. We also draw attention to the fact that\nthe IR stability conditions are also enforced by the existence requirements of\nconsistent background solutions.\n", "  Massive early-type galaxies have higher metallicities and higher ratios of\n$\\alpha$ elements to iron than their less massive counterparts. Reproducing\nthese correlations has long been a problem for hierarchical galaxy formation\ntheory, both in semi-analytic models and cosmological hydrodynamic simulations.\nWe show that a simulation in which gas cooling in massive dark haloes is\nquenched by radio-mode active galactic nuclei (AGNs) feedback naturally\nreproduces the observed trend between $\\alpha$/Fe and the velocity dispersion\nof galaxies, $\\sigma$. The quenching occurs earlier for more massive galaxies.\nConsequently, these galaxies complete their star formation before $\\alpha$/Fe\nis diluted by the contribution from type Ia supernovae. For galaxies more\nmassive than $\\sim 10^{11}~M_\\odot$ whose $\\alpha$/Fe correlates positively\nwith stellar mass, we find an inversely correlated mass-metallicity relation.\nThis is a common problem in simulations in which star formation in massive\ngalaxies is quenched either by quasar- or radio-mode AGN feedback. The early\nsuppression of gas cooling in progenitors of massive galaxies prevents them\nfrom recapturing enriched gas ejected as winds. Simultaneously reproducing the\n[$\\alpha$/Fe]-$\\sigma$ relation and the mass-metallicity relation is, thus,\ndifficult in the current framework of galaxy formation.\n", "  The LIT approach is tested for the calculation of astrophysical S-factors. As\nan example the S-factor of the reaction 2H(p,gamma)3He is considered. It is\ndiscussed that a sufficiently high density of LIT states at low energies is\nnecessary for a precise determination of S-factors. In particular it is shown\nthat the hyperspherical basis is not very well suited for such a calculation\nand that a different basis system is much more advantageous. A comparison of\nLIT results with calculations, where continuum wave functions are explicitly\nused, shows that the LIT approach leads to reliable results. It is also shown\nhow an error estimate of the LIT inversion can be obtained.\n", "  Recent studies of the hot QCD matter indicate that the bulk viscosity\n($\\zeta$) of quark-gluon plasma (QGP) rises sharply near the critical point of\nthe QCD phase transition. In this work, we show that such a sharp rise of the\nbulk viscosity will lead to an effective negative pressure near the critical\ntemperature, $T_{c}$ which in turn drives the Universe to inflate. This\ninflation has a natural graceful exist when the viscous effect evanesce. We\nestimate that, depending upon the peak value of $\\zeta$, universe expands by a\nfactor of $10$ to $80$ times in a very short span ($\\Delta t\\sim 10^{-8}$\nseconds). Another important outcome of the bulk viscosity dominated dynamics is\nthe cavitation of QGP around $T \\sim 1.5T_{c}$. This would lead to the\nphenomenon of formation of cavitation bubbles within the QGP phase. The above\nscenario is independent of the order of QCD phase transition. We delineate some\nof the important cosmological consequences of the inflation and the cavitation.\n", "  We provide a general construction of quantum generalized master equations\nwith memory kernel leading to well defined, that is completely positive and\ntrace preserving, time evolutions. The approach builds on an operator\ngeneralization of memory kernels appearing in the description of non-Markovian\nclassical processes, and puts into evidence the non uniqueness of the\nrelationship arising due to the typical quantum issue of operator ordering. The\napproach provides a physical interpretation of the structure of the kernels,\nand its connection with the classical viewpoint allows for a trajectory\ndescription of the dynamics. Previous apparently unrelated results are now\nconnected in a unified framework, which further allows to phenomenologically\nconstruct a large class of non-Markovian evolutions taking as starting point\ncollections of time dependent maps and instantaneous transformations describing\nthe microscopic interaction dynamics.\n", "  We present first results of classical-statistical real-time simulations of\nanomalous transport phenomena with overlap fermions. We find that even on small\nlattices overlap fermions reproduce the real-time anomaly equation with much\nbetter precision than Wilson-Dirac fermions on an order of magnitude larger\nlattices. The difference becomes much more pronounced for quickly changing\nelectromagnetic fields, especially if one takes into account the back-reaction\nof fermions on electromagnetism. As test cases, we consider chirality pumping\nin parallel electric and magnetic fields and mixing between the plasmon and the\nChiral Magnetic Wave.\n", "  We consider quantum inverse scattering with singular potentials and calculate\nthe Sine-Gordon model effective potential in the laboratory and centre-of-mass\nframes. The effective potentials are frame dependent but closely resemble the\nzero-momentum potential of the equivalent Ruijsenaars-Schneider model.\n", "  Previous theoretical considerations of electron beam relaxation in\ninhomogeneous plasmas have indicated that the effects of the irregular solar\nwind may account for the poor agreement of homogeneous modelling with the\nobservations. Quasi-linear theory and Hamiltonian models based on Zakharov's\nequations have indicated that when a level of density fluctuations is above a\ngiven threshold, density irregularities act to de-resonate the beam-plasma\ninteraction, restricting Langmuir wave growth on the expense of beam energy.\nThis work presents the first fully kinetic particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations\nof beam relaxation under the influence of density irregularities. We aim to\nindependently determine the influence of background inhomogeneity on the\nbeam-plasma system, and to test theoretical predictions and alternative models\nusing a fully kinetic treatment. We carry out 1D PIC simulations of a\nbump-on-tail unstable electron beam in the presence of increasing levels of\nbackground inhomogeneity using the fully electromagnetic, relativistic EPOCH\nPIC code. We find that in the case of homogeneous background plasma density,\nLangmuir wave packets are generated at the resonant condition and then\nquasi-liear relaxation leads to a dynamic increase of wavenumbers generated. No\nelectron acceleration is seen - unlike in the inhomogeneous experiments, all of\nwhich produce high-energy electrons. For the inhomogeneous experiments we also\nobserve the generation of backwards propagating Langmuir waves, which is shown\ndirectly to be due to the refraction of the packets off the density gradients.\nOur fully kinetic PIC simulations broadly confirm the findings of quasi-linear\ntheory and the Hamiltonian model based on Zakharov's equations. Strong density\nfluctuations modify properties of excited Langmuir waves altering their\ndispersion properties.\n", "  The label propagation algorithm (LPA) has been proved to be a fast and\neffective method for detecting communities in large complex networks. However,\nits performance is subject to the non-stable and trivial solutions of the\nproblem. In this paper, we propose a modified label propagation algorithm LPAf\nto efficiently detect community structures in networks. Instead of the majority\nvoting rule of the basic LPA, LPAf updates the label of a node by considering\nthe compression of a description of random walks on a network. A multi-step\ngreedy agglomerative strategy is employed to enable LPAf to escape the local\noptimum. Furthermore, an incomplete update condition is also adopted to speed\nup the convergence. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world\nnetworks confirm the effectiveness of our algorithm.\n", "  Deep spectrophotometry has proved to be a fundamental tool to improve our\nknowledge on the chemical content of planetary nebulae. With the arrival of\nvery efficient spectrographs installed in the largest ground-based telescopes,\noutstanding spectra have been obtained. These data are essential to constrain\nstate-of-the-art nucleosynthesis models in asymptotic giant branch stars and,\nin general, to understand the chemical evolution of our Galaxy. In this paper\nwe review the last advances on the chemical composition of the ionized gas in\nplanetary nebulae based on faint emission lines observed through very deep\nspectrophotometric data.\n", "  Are dreidels fair? In other words, does the average dreidel have an equal\nchance of turning up any one of its four sides? To explore this hypothesis,\nthree different dreidels were each spun hundreds of times with the number of\noccurrences of each side recorded. It was found that all three dreidels tested\n-- a cheap plastic dreidel, an old wooden dreidel, and a dreidel that came\nembossed with a picture of Santa Claus -- were not fair. Statistically, for\neach dreidel, some sides came up significantly more often than others. Although\nan unfair dreidel does not necessarily make the game itself unfair, it is\nconjectured that hundreds of pounds of chocolate have been distributed during\nChanukah under false pretenses.\n", "  In order to asses the effect of hydrodynamics in the assembly of active\nattractive spheres, we simulate a semi-dilute suspension of attractive\nself-propelled spherical particles in a quasi two dimensional geometry\ncomparing the case with and without hydrodynamics interactions. To start with,\nindependently on the presence of hydrodynamics, we observe that depending on\nthe ratio between attraction and propulsion, particles either coarsen or\naggregate forming finite-size clusters. Focusing on the clustering regime, we\ncharacterize two different clusters parameters, i.e. their morphology and\norientational order, and compare the case when active particles behave either\nas pushers or pullers (always in the regime where inter-particles attractions\ncompetes with self-propulsion). Studying cluster phases for squirmers with\nrespect to those obtained for active Brownian disks (indicated as ABP), we have\nshown that hydrodynamics alone can sustain a cluster phase of active swimmers\n(pullers), while ABP form cluster phases due to the competition between\nattraction and self propulsion. The structural properties of the cluster phases\nof squirmers and ABP are similar, although squirmers show sensitivity to active\nstresses. Active Brownian disks resemble weakly pusher squirmer suspensions in\nterms of cluster size distribution, structure of the radius of gyration on\ncluster size and degree of cluster polarity.\n", "  The article demonstrates some less known principles of image build-up in\ndiffractive microscopy and their usage in analysis unravelling the smallest\nlocalized information about the original object - an electromagnetic centroid.\nIn fluorescence, the electromagnetic centroid is naturally at the position of\nthe fluorophore. The usage of an information-entropic variable - a point\ndivergence gain - is demonstrated for finding the most localized position of\nthe object's representation, generally of the size of a voxel (3D pixel). These\nspatial pixels can be qualitatively classified and used for reconstruction of\nthe 3D structures with precision comparable with electron microscopy.\n", "  We propose a \"social physics\" model for two-group conflict. We consider two\ndisputing groups. Each individual i in each of the two groups has a preference\nsi regarding the way in which the conflict should be resolved. The individual\npreferences span a range between +M (prone to protracted conflict) and --M\n(prone to settle the conflict). The noise in this system is quantified by a\n\"social temperature.\" Individuals interact within their group and with\nindividuals of the other group. A pair of individuals (i, j) within a group\ncontributes-si * sj to the energy. The inter-group energy of individual i is\ntaken to be proportional to the product between si and the mean value of the\npreferences from the other group's members. We consider an equivalent-neighbor\nRenyi-Erdos network where everyone interacts with everyone. We present some\nexamples of conflicts that may be described with this model.\n  PACS numbers: 89.65.-s Social and economic system, 89.75.-k Complex systems,\n05.90.+m Other topics in statistical physics, thermodynamics, and nonlinear\ndynamical systems\n", "  In this paper, we extend the analysis of a Pati-Salam subcritical hybrid\n$F$-term inflation model, proposed by two of us, by studying the reheating and\nthe baryogenesis (via leptogenesis) of the model. This SUSY GUT model is able\nto fit low energy electroweak precision data, LHC data, $b$-physics data, in\naddition to inflation observables such as the tensor-to-scalar ratio and the\nscalar spectral index. The reheating mechanism of this model is instant\npreheating due to the bosonic and fermionic broad parametric resonance, while\nthe baryon-to-entropy ratio is obtained from the CP asymmetric right-handed\n(s)neutrinos decay. The phases in the neutrino Yukawa matrices are fixed by\nfitting to the low energy observables. With these phases, the heaviest\nright-handed (s)neutrinos decay to produce a lepton asymmetry with the correct\nsign, while the two lighter right-handed (s)neutrinos decay to produce the\nwrong sign. Consequently, the baryogenesis analysis is necessarily performed by\nincluding all three families of the right-handed (s)neutrinos.\n", "  This is a critical review of MAX-phase carbides and nitrides from an\nelectronic-structure and chemical bonding perspective. This large group of\nnanolaminated materials is of great scientific and technological interest and\nexhibit a combination of metallic and ceramic features. These properties are\nrelated to the special crystal structure and bonding characteristics with\nalternating strong M-C bonds in high-density MC slabs, and relatively weak M-A\nbonds between the slabs. Here, we review the trend and relationship between the\nchemical bonding, conductivity, elastic and magnetic properties of the MAX\nphases in comparison to the parent binary MX compounds with the underlying\nelectronic structure probed by polarized X-ray spectroscopy. Spectroscopic\nstudies constitute important tests of the results of state-of-the-art\nelectronic structure density functional theory that is extensively discussed\nand are generally consistent. By replacing the elements on the M, A, or X-sites\nin the crystal structure, the corresponding changes in the conductivity,\nelasticity, magnetism and other materials properties makes it possible to\ntailor the characteristics of this class of materials by controlling the\nstrengths of their chemical bonds.\n", "  The trajectory of energy is modeled by the solution of the Eikonal equation,\nwhich can be solved by solving a Hamiltonian system. This system is amenable of\ntreatment from the point view of the theory of Differential Algebra. In\nparticular, by Morales-Ramis theory it is possible to analyze integrable\nHamiltonian systems through the abelian structure of their variational\nequations. In this paper we obtain the abelian differential Galois groups and\nthe representation of the quiver, that allow us to obtain such abelian\ndifferential Galois groups, for some seismic models with constant Hessian of\nsquare of slowness, proposed in Cerveny 2001, which are equivalent to linear\nHamiltonian systems with three uncoupled harmonic oscillators.\n", "  Nonclassicality criteria based on intensity moments and derived from the\nusual matrix approach are compared to those provided by the majorization\ntheory. The majorization theory is shown to give a greater number of more\nsuitable nonclassicality criteria. Fifteen experimentally useful criteria of\nthe majorization theory containing the intensity moments up to the fifth order\nare identified. Their performance is experimentally demonstrated on the set of\neleven potentially nonclassical states generated from a twin beam by\npostselection based on detecting a given number of photocounts in one arm by\nusing an iCCD camera.\n", "  The problem of the gauge hierarchy is brought up in a hypercomplex scheme for\na U(1) field theory; in such a scheme a compact gauge group is deformed through\na \\gamma-parameter that varies along a non-compact internal direction,\ntransverse to the U(1) compact one, and thus an additional SO(1,1) gauge\nsymmetry is incorporated. This transverse direction can be understood as an\nextra internal dimension, which will control the spontaneous symmetry\nbreakdown, and will allow us to establish a mass hierarchy. In this mechanism\nthere is no brane separation to be stabilized as in the braneworld paradigm,\nhowever, a different kind of fine-tuning is needed in order to generate the\nwished electroweak/Planck hierarchy. By analyzing the effective\nself-interactions and mass terms of the theory, an interesting duality is\nrevealed between the real and hybrid parts of the effective potential. This\nduality relates the weak and strong self-interaction regimes of the theory, due\nto the fact that both mass terms and self-coupling constants appear as\none-parameter flows in \\gamma. Additionally the \\gamma-deformation will\nestablish a flow for the electromagnetic coupling that mimics the\nrenormalization group flow for the charge in QED.\n", "  Self-assembly via nanoscale phase-separation offers an elegant route to\nfabricate nanocomposites with physical properties unattainable in\nsingle-component systems. One important class of nanocomposites are optical\nmetamaterials which exhibit exotic properties and lead to opportunities for\nagile control of light propagation. Such metamaterials are typically fabricated\nvia expensive and hard-to-scale top-down processes requiring precise\nintegration of dissimilar materials. In turn, there is a need for alternative,\nmore efficient routes to fabricate large-scale metamaterials for practical\napplications with deep-subwavelength resolution. Here, we demonstrate a\nbottom-up approach to fabricate scalable nanostructured metamaterials via\nspinodal decomposition. To demonstrate the potential of such an approach, we\nleverage the innate spinodal decomposition of the VO2-TiO2 system, the\nmetal-to-insulator transition in VO2, and thin-film epitaxy, to produce\nself-organized nanostructures with coherent interfaces and a structural unit\ncell down to 15 nm (tunable between horizontally- and vertically-aligned\nlamellae) wherein the iso-frequency surface is temperature-tunable from\nelliptic- to hyperbolic-dispersion producing metamaterial behavior. These\nresults provide an efficient route for the fabrication of nanostructured\nmetamaterials and other nanocomposites for desired functionalities.\n", "  We study the dynamics of an over damped Brownian particle in a saw tooth\npotential in the presence of a temporal asymmetric driving force. We observe\nthat in the deterministic limit, the transport coherence, which is determined\nby a dimensionless quantity called Peclet number, $Pe$ is quite high for larger\nspatial asymmetry in the ratchet potential. For all the regime of parameter\nspace of this model, $Pe$ follows the nature of current like Stokes efficiency.\nDiffusion as a function of amplitude of drive shows a minimum exactly at which\nthe current shows a maximum. Unlike the previously studied models, the $Pe$ as\na function of temperature shows a peaking behavior and the coherence in\ntransport decreases for high temperatures. In the nonadiabatic regime, the $Pe$\nas a function of amplitude of drive decreases and the peak gets broader as a\nresult the transport becomes unreliable.\n", "  We demonstrate a series of InGaN/GaN double quantum well nanostructure\nelements. We grow a layer of 2 {\\mu}m undoped GaN template on top of a\n(0001)-direction sapphire substrate. A 100 nm SiO2 thin film is deposited on\ntop as a masking pattern layer. This layer is then covered with a 300 nm\naluminum layer as the anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) hole pattern layer. After\noxalic acid etching, we transfer the hole pattern from the AAO layer to the\nSiO2 layer by reactive ion etching. Lastly, we utilize metal-organic chemical\nvapor deposition to grow GaN nanorods approximately 1.5 {\\mu}m in size. We then\ngrow two layers of InGaN/GaN double quantum wells on the semi-polar face of the\nGaN nanorod substrate under different temperatures. We then study the\ncharacteristics of the InGaN/GaN quantum wells formed on the semi-polar faces\nof GaN nanorods. We report the following findings from our study: first, using\nSiO2 with repeating hole pattern, we are able to grow high-quality GaN nanorods\nwith diameters of approximately 80-120 nm; second, photoluminescence (PL)\nmeasurements enable us to identify Fabry-Perot effect from InGaN/GaN quantum\nwells on the semi-polar face. We calculate the quantum wells' cavity thickness\nwith obtained PL measurements. Lastly, high resolution TEM images allow us to\nstudy the lattice structure characteristics of InGaN/GaN quantum wells on GaN\nnanorod and identify the existence of threading dislocations in the lattice\nstructure that affects the GaN nanorod's growth mechanism.\n", "  We give a conjectural formula for sheaves supported on (irreducible) conormal\nvarieties inside the cotangent bundle of the Grassmannian, such that their\nequivariant $K$-class is given by the partition function of an integrable loop\nmodel, and furthermore their $K$-theoretic pushforward to a point is a solution\nof the level $1$ quantum Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equation. We prove these\nresults in the case that the Lagrangian is smooth (hence is the conormal bundle\nto a subGrassmannian). To compute the pushforward to a point, or equivalently\nto the affinization, we simultaneously degenerate the Lagrangian and sheaf\n(over the affinization); the sheaf degenerates to a direct sum of cyclic\nmodules over the geometric components, which are in bijection with plane\npartitions, giving a geometric interpretation to the Razumov-Stroganov\ncorrespondence satisfied by the loop model.\n", "  Superradiant decay is accompanied by two kinds of collective lineshifts, an\ninduced shift and the spontaneous \"collective Lamb shift.\" Both form as sum of\ndipole-dipole interaction-induced level shifts between atoms in the system. We\nhave developed a procedure to obtain numerical results on this model that\nself-consistently incorporates the shifts. The induced shift displays large\nnon-zero values early in the system evolution. In addition, its effect on the\nsuperradiant system is studied: there is only a very small dephasing effect on\nthe decay rate. While the induced shift is largely absent in not-too strongly\ndriven systems, this parameter region might provide a good experimental regime\nfor measuring the collective Lamb shift. These results can have important\nconsequences for highly sensitive systems, such as quantum information science\nor atomic clocks.\n", "  A spatial light modulator (SLM) is one of the most useful and convenient\ndevice to generate structural light beams such as twisted light and complexed\nimages used in modern optical science. The unbounded dimension of twisted light\nmakes it promising in harnessing information carrying ability of a single\nphoton, which greatly enhances the channel capacity in optical communications.\nWe perform a detail theoretical study of the birth, evolution and reverse\ntransformation of twisted light generated from a phase-only SLM based on\ndiffraction theory, analytical expressions are obtained to show the special\nevolution behaviors of the light beam with the propagation distance. Beam\nintensity distributions calculated theoretically are in well agreement with\nexperimental observations. Our findings clearly reveal how twisted light\ngradually emerges from a Gaussian spatial shape to a ring shape, and also the\nring shape will gradually evolve to a quasi-Gaussian shape conversely, in the\nreverse transformation. These results will provide guidelines for using SLM in\nmany optical experiments and OAM-mode multiplexing in optical communications.\n", "  We prove the global non-linear stability, without symmetry assumptions, of\nslowly rotating charged black holes in de Sitter spacetimes in the context of\nthe initial value problem for the Einstein-Maxwell equations: If one perturbs\nthe initial data of a slowly rotating Kerr-Newman-de Sitter (KNdS) black hole,\nthen in a neighborhood of the exterior region of the black hole, the metric and\nthe electromagnetic field decay exponentially fast to their values for a\npossibly different member of the KNdS family. This is a continuation of recent\nwork of the author with Vasy on the stability of the Kerr-de Sitter family for\nthe Einstein vacuum equations. Our non-linear iteration scheme automatically\nfinds the final black hole parameters as well as the gauge in which the global\nsolution exists; we work in a generalized wave coordinate/Lorenz gauge, with\ngauge source functions lying in a suitable finite-dimensional space.\n  We include a self-contained proof of the linear mode stability of\nReissner-Nordstr\\\"om-de Sitter black holes, building on work by\nKodama-Ishibashi. In the course of our non-linear stability argument, we also\nobtain the first proof of the linear (mode) stability of slowly rotating KNdS\nblack holes using robust perturbative techniques.\n", "  The optimized effective potential (OEP) method is a promising technique for\ncalculating the ground state properties of a system within the density\nfunctional theory. However, it is not widely used as its computational cost is\nrather high and, also, some ambiguity remains in the theoretical framework. In\norder to overcome these problems, we first introduced a method that accelerates\nthe OEP scheme in a static RPA-level correlation functional. Second, the\nKrieger-Li-Iafrate (KLI) approximation is exploited to solve the OEP equation.\nAlthough seemingly too crude, this approximation did not reduce the accuracy of\nthe description of the magnetic transition metals (Fe, Co, and Ni) examined\nhere, the magnetic properties of which are rather sensitive to correlation\neffects. Finally, we reformulated the OEP method to render it applicable to the\ndirect RPA correlation functional and other, more precise, functionals.\nEmphasis is placed on the following three points of the discussion: i)\nLevel-crossing at the Fermi surface is taken into account; ii) eigenvalue\nvariations in a Kohn-Sham functional are correctly treated; and iii) the\nresultant OEP equation is different from those reported to date.\n", "  By studying the rotations of the polarization of light propagating in right\nand left handed films, with emphasis on the transmission (Faraday effect) and\nreflec- tions (Kerr effect) of light and through the use of complex values\nrepresenting the rotations, it can be shown that the real portions of the\ncomplex angle of Faraday and Kerr rotations are odd functions with respect to\nthe refractive index n and that the respective imaginary portions of the angles\nare an even function of n. Multiple reflections within the medium lead to the\nmaximums of the real portions of Faraday and Kerr effects to not coincide with\nzero ellipticity. It will also be shown that in the thin film case with left\nhanded materials there are large resonant enhancements of the reflected Kerr\nangle that could be obtained experimentally.\n", "  We investigate the radiative coupling between two two-level atoms with\narbitrarily polarized dipoles in the vicinity of a nanofiber. We present a\nsystematic derivation for the master equation, the single- and cross-atom decay\ncoefficients, and the dipole-dipole interaction coefficients for the atoms\ninteracting with the vacuum of the field in the guided and radiation modes of\nthe nanofiber. We study numerically the case where the atomic dipoles are\ncircularly polarized. In this case, the rate of emission depends on the\npropagation direction, that is, the radiative interaction between the atoms is\nchiral. We examine the time evolution of the atoms for different initial\nstates. We calculate the fluxes and mean numbers of photons spontaneously\nemitted into guided modes in the positive and negative directions of the fiber\naxis. We show that the chiral radiative coupling modifies the collective\nemission of the atoms. We observe that the modifications strongly depend on the\ninitial state of the atomic system, the radiative transfer direction, the\ndistance between the atoms, and the distance from the atoms to the fiber\nsurface.\n", "  Microtubules (MTs) are the most important part of cytoskeleton. In this paper\nwe deal with two basic nonlinear differential equations coming from the two\nknown models describing nonlinear dynamics of MTs. These equations are solved\nusing the series expansion unknown functions method (SEUFM). Trying to\nrecognize the most general mathematical procedure for solving these equations\nthe solutions are compared with those obtained earlier using the tangent\nhyperbolic function method (THFM) and the simplest equation method (SEM). In\nall these three approaches we express the solutions of these equations as\nseries expansions. In the cases of THFM and SEM the functions existing in the\nseries are known while SEUFM assumes unknown functions.\n", "  We have studied the nuclear structure properties like binding energy, charge\nradius, quadrupole deformation parameter for various isotopes of Al from the\nvalley of stability to drip line region using the well known relativistic mean\nfield formalism (RMF) with NL3 parameter set. We have compared our results with\nexperimental data and found reasonable agreement. Further, we have taken\nspherical and deformed RMF densities to estimate the reaction dynamics of\n$^{23-28}$Al isotopes as projectiles and $^{12}$C as target by conjunction in\nGlauber model. The estimated results are also compared with the experimental\ndata. The analysis of angular elastic differential and one proton removal cross\nsections are also studied with Glauber model many body system to investigate\nthe structural feature of $^{23}$Al. The evidence of enhanced total reaction\ncross section, higher value of rms radius, narrow longitudinal momentum\ndistribution and small proton separation energy of $^{23}$Al support its proton\nhalo structure.\n", "  With various experiments studying heavy-ion collisions a demand exists in the\nhadron physics community for theoretical predictions of hadronic properties at\ntemperatures and densities far from equilibrium. In this work we will study the\n$J/\\psi$ vector meson at finite temperatures surrounded by light quark matter.\nWe will apply a chiral unitary approach to account for coupled channels, most\nimportantly channels with open charm. The in-medium solution accounts for the\nchange in self-energy that the $J/\\psi$ acquires from interacting with the\nsurrounding light quark matter, most notably pions and rho mesons. The results\nare preliminary and clearly show the importance of using dressed charmed\nmesons. Ultimately, the solutions to the corresponding Lippmann-Schwinger\nEquations are used to calculate observables such as the spectral function of\nthe $J/\\psi$.\n", "  We have been developing a neutron detector with spatial resolution of\nsubmicron by loading 6Li into fine-grained nuclear emulsion. By exposure to\nthermal neutrons, tracks from neutron capture events were observed. From their\ngrain density, spatial resolution was estimated. Detection efficiency was also\nmeasured by an experiment with cold neutrons.\n", "  Two different probes, viz., 111In/111Cd and 181Hf/181Ta, simultaneously have\nbeen incorporated in both pure rutile and Hafnium (Hf) -doped rutile Titanium\nDioxide (TiO2) systems following a soft chemical method. The local information\naround two different probe sites in the same sample could be extracted in a\nsingle Time Differential Perturbed Angular Correlation (TDPAC) measurement\nusing LIST mode data acquisition. The two probes were incorporated in the\nrutile samples by co-precipitation technique and then annealed at 1273K for 10h\nto get the rutile structure. The rutile structure was identified by the\nhyperfine parameters, viz., quadrupole frequency ({\\omega}Q) and asymmetry\n(eta). At 111Cd site, {\\omega}Q=16.8(1) Mrad/s and eta=0.19(1) while at 181Ta\nsite, {\\omega}Q=127.2(2) Mrad/s and eta=0.56(1). Due to the doping of Hf at 5\nand 10 atom%, the sample partially lost the purity of the crystal and the fact\nhas been reflected at both the probe sites.\n", "  Employing the Batalin-Vilkovisky (BV) formalism, we present a systematic and\nsimple prescription to derive (first-class) constraints including the\nHamiltonian constraint (a.k.a. flow equation), which plays pivotal role in\nholographic computation of Weyl anomalies. In this method, you do not have to\ncompute canonical momenta nor Hamiltonians. Thus it may equip us with a\n`Lagrangian treatment' of constrained systems. We also point out an interesting\nanalogy between antifields and first-class constraints.\n", "  Photoionized nebulae comprise basically HII regions and planetary nebulae,\nand their abundances give important clues on the nucleosynthesis and chemical\nevolution of their host galaxies. There is presently a large amount of data on\nthese objects, especially for the elements He and N, which are strongly\naffected by the evolution of intermediate mass stars, as well as O, Ne, S, and\nAr, which are essentially synthesized in stars with larger masses. The\nabundances of these elements in several systems in the Local Group are\ndiscussed on the basis of distance-independent correlations.\n", "  For flares to be generated, stars have to have a sufficiently deep outer\nconvection zone (F5 and later), strong large--scale magnetic fields (Ap/Bp-type\nstars) or strong, radiatively driven winds (B5 and earlier). Normal A-type\nstars possess none of these and therefore should not flare. Nevertheless,\nflares have previously been detected in the Kepler lightcurves of 33 A-type\nstars and interpreted to be intrinsic to the stars. Here we present new and\ndetailed analyses of these 33 stars, imposing very strict criteria for the\nflare detection. We confirm the presence of flare-like features in 27 of the 33\nA-type stars. A study of the pixel data and the surrounding field-of-view (FOV)\nreveals that 14 of these 27 flaring objects have overlapping neighbouring stars\nand 5 stars show clear contamination in the pixel data. We have obtained\nhigh-resolution spectra for 2/3 of the entire sample and confirm that our\ntargets are indeed A-type stars. Detailed analyses revealed that 11 out of 19\nstars with multiple epochs of observations are spectroscopic binaries.\nFurthermore, and contrary to previous studies, we find that the flares can\noriginate from a cooler, unresolved companion. We note the presence of\nH$\\alpha$ emission in eight stars. Whether this emission is circumstellar or\nmagnetic in origin is unknown. In summary, we find possible alternative\nexplanations for the observed flares for at least 19 of the 33 A-type stars,\nbut find no truly convincing target to support the hypothesis of flaring A-type\nstars.\n", "  The uneven distribution of wealth and individual economic capacities are\namong the main forces which shape modern societies and arguably bias the\nemerging social structures. However, the study of correlations between the\nsocial network and economic status of individuals is difficult due to the lack\nof large-scale multimodal data disclosing both the social ties and economic\nindicators of the same population. Here, we close this gap through the analysis\nof coupled datasets recording the mobile phone communications and bank\ntransaction history of one million anonymised individuals living in a Latin\nAmerican country. We show that wealth and debt are unevenly distributed among\npeople in agreement with the Pareto principle; the observed social structure is\nstrongly stratified, with people being better connected to others of their own\nsocioeconomic class rather than to others of different classes; the social\nnetwork appears with assortative socioeconomic correlations and tightly\nconnected \"rich clubs\"; and that egos from the same class live closer to each\nother but commute further if they are wealthier. These results are based on a\nrepresentative, society-large population, and empirically demonstrate some\nlong-lasting hypotheses on socioeconomic correlations which potentially lay\nbehind social segregation, and induce differences in human mobility.\n", "  Using the color glass condensate formalism, we study the nuclear modification\nof forward $J/\\psi$ and $D$ meson production in high energy proton-nucleus\ncollisions at the LHC. We show that relying on the optical Glauber model to\nobtain the dipole cross section of the nucleus from the one of the proton\nfitted to HERA DIS data leads to a smaller nuclear suppression than in the\nfirst study of these processes in this formalism and a better agreement with\nexperimental data.\n", "  Quantum correlations represent a fundamental tool for studies ranging from\nbasic science to quantum technologies. Different non-classical correlations\nhave been identified and studied, as entanglement and discord. In this Paper we\nexplore experimentally the rich geometry of polarization Bell-diagonal states.\nBy taking advantage of the statistical method of generation, the values of\nentanglement and discord along different trajectories in the space of the\nparameters of density matrix have been measured. The effects of sudden death of\nentanglement and complete \"freeze\" of discord were investigated in order to\ndetect the domains with different domination of one type of quantum correlation\nagainst to other. A geometric interpretation for each considered phenomena is\naddressed. The observed good agreement between experiment and theory for all\ninvestigated trajectories ensures the reliability of this method.\n", "  We intended to compile the most complete catalog of bona fide members and\ncandidate members of the beta Pictoris association, and to measure their\nrotation periods and basic properties from our own observations, public\narchives, and exploring the literature. We carried out a multi-observatories\ncampaign to get our own photometric time series and collected all archived\npublic photometric data time series for the stars in our catalog. Each time\nseries was analyzed with the Lomb-Scargle and CLEAN periodograms to search for\nthe stellar rotation periods. We complemented the measured rotational\nproperties with detailed information on multiplicity, membership, and projected\nrotational velocity available in the literature and discussed star by star. We\nmeasured the rotation periods of 112 out of 117 among bona fide members and\ncandidate members of the beta Pictoris association and, whenever possible, we\nalso measured the luminosity, radius, and inclination of the stellar rotation\naxis. This represents to date the largest catalog of rotation periods of any\nyoung loose stellar association. We provided an extensive catalog of rotation\nperiods together with other relevant basic properties useful to explore a\nnumber of open issues, such as the causes of spread of rotation periods among\ncoeval stars, evolution of angular momentum, and lithium-rotation connection.\n", "  The CHIPS experiment will comprise a 10 kton water Cherenkov detector in an\nopen mine pit in northern Minnesota, USA. The detector has been simulated using\na full GEANT4 simulation and a series of event reconstruction algorithms have\nbeen developed to exploit the charge and time information from all of the PMTs.\nA comparison of simulated CCQE nu_mu and nu_e interactions using 10 inch and 3\ninch PMTs is presented, alongside a comparison of 10% and 6% photocathode\ncoverage for 3 inch PMTs. The studies demonstrate that the required selection\nefficiency and purity of charged-current nu_e interactions can be achieved\nusing a photocathode coverage of 6% with 3 inch PMTs. Finally, a dedicated\npi-zero fitter is shown to successfully reconstruct a clean sample of pi-zero\nmesons despite the low 6% photocathode coverage with 3 inch PMTs.\n", "  Ion temperature in the scrape-off layer is an important quantity but rarely\nmeasured at high temporal resolution. In order to achieve fast measurements\nduring intermittent events such as blobs, a novel ExB analyzer has been\ndesigned. The measurement with the E$\\times$B analyzer does not require voltage\nsweeping but records ion current on DC biased collectors, meaning that the\ntemporal resolution is only limited by the sampling frequency of the data\nacquisition system and electronics of the amplifiers, which exceeds the typical\ntimescale of events of interest (~10 microseconds).\n  The analyzer is equipped with entrance slit of optimized knife-edge shape,\nwhich reduces selective ion losses and improves overall ion transmission. The\ndesign of the analyzer is presented together with first acquired signals and\nreconstructed temperatures.\n", "  We show the existence of a resonant behavior of the current of Brownian\nparticles confined in a pulsating channel. The interplay between the periodic\noscillations of the shape of the channel and a force applied along its axis\nleads to an increase of the particle current as a function of the noise level.\nA regime of current inversion is also observed for particular values of the\noscillation frequency and the applied force. The model proposed to obtain these\nnew behaviors of the current is based on the Fick-Jacobs equation in which the\nentropic barrier and the effective diffusion coefficient depend on time. The\nphenomenon observed could be used to optimize transport in microfluidic devices\nor biological channels.\n", "  The Fermilab Short Baseline Neutrino (SBN) program aims to observe and\nreconstruct thousands of neutrino-argon interactions with its three detectors\n(SBND, MicroBooNE and ICARUS-T600), using their hundred of tonnes Liquid Argon\nTime Projection Chambers to perform a rich physics analysis program, in\nparticular focused in the search for sterile neutrinos. Given the relatively\nshallow depth of the detectors, the continuos flux of cosmic ray particles\nwhich crossing their volumes introduces a constant background which can be\nfalsely identified as part of the event of interest. Here we present the Cosmic\nRay Tagger (CRT) system, a novel technique to tag and identify these crossing\nparticles using scintillation modules which measure their time and coordinates\nrelative to events internal to the neutrino detector, mitigating therefore\ntheir effect in the event tracking reconstruction.\n", "  A new phenomenological model of cyclic creep is proposed which is suitable\nfor applications involving finite creep deformations of the material. The model\naccounts for the the effect of the transient increase of the creep strain rate\nupon the load reversal. In order to extend the applicability range of the\nmodel, the creep process is fully coupled to the classical Kachanov-Rabonov\ndamage evolution. As a result, the proposed model describes all the three\nstages of creep. Large strain kinematics is described in a geometrically exact\nmanner using the assumption of a nested multiplicative split, originally\nproposed by Lion for finite strain plasticity. The model is thermodynamically\nadmissible, objective, and w-invariant. Implicit time integration of the\nproposed evolution equations is discussed. The corresponding numerical\nalgorithm is implemented into the commercial FEM code MSC.MARC. Using this\ncode, the model is validated using real experimental data on cyclic torsion of\na thick-walled tubular specimen made of the D16T aluminium alloy. The\nnumerically computed stress distribution exhibits a \"skeletal point\" within the\nspecimen.\n", "  In this paper, we analyze two different techniques based on reservoir\nengineering method and quantum Zeno effect for controlling decoherence of a\ndissipative charged oscillator in the presence of an external magnetic field.\nOur main focus is to investigate the sensitiveness of these decoherence control\ntechniques on the details of different environmental spectrum ($J(\\omega)$),\nand on the crucial role played by different system and reservoir parameters,\ne.g., external magnetic field ($r_c$), confinement length ($r_0$), temperature\n(T), cut-off frequency of reservoir spectrum ($\\omega_{cut}$), and measurement\ninterval ($\\tau$). First, we consider the charged quantum oscillator in an\ninitial nonclassical Schr\u007fodinger cat state and analyze the non-Markovian\ndynamics for the magneto-oscillator in contact with Ohmic, sub-Ohmic, and\nsuper-Ohmic environments. We show the procedure to control the quantumness of\nthe Schr\u007fodinger cat state by tuning the parameters $r_c$, $r_0$, and\n$J(\\omega)$. On the other hand, we investigate the effect of nonselective\nenergy measurement process on the mortification of quantumness of an initial\nFock-Darwin state of the charged magneto-oscillator. We investigate in details\nthe strategy to manipulate the continuous passage from decay suppression to\ndecay acceleration by engineered reservoirs and by tuning the system or\nreservoir parameters, e.g., $r_c$, $r_0$, T or $\\tau$. As a result of that one\ncan control environment induced decoherence (EID).\n", "  Controlling the balanced gain and loss in a PT-symmetric system is a rather\nchallenging task. Utilizing Floquet theory, we explore the constructive role of\nperiodic modulation in controlling the gain and loss of a PT-symmetric optical\ncoupler. It is found that the gain and loss of the system can be manipulated by\napplying a periodic modulation. Further, such an original non-Hermitian system\ncan even be modulated into an effective Hermitian system derived by the\nhigh-frequency Floquet method. Therefore, compared with other PT symmetry\ncontrol schemes, our protocol can modulate the unbroken PT-symmetric range to a\nwider parameter region. Our results provide a promising approach for\ncontrolling the gain and loss of a realistic system.\n", "  It has been proposed for a long time now that the reduction of the thermal\nconductivity by reducing the phonon mean free path is one of the best way to\nimprove the current performance of thermoelectrics. By measuring the thermal\nconductance and thermal conductivity of nanowires and thin films, we show\ndifferent ways of increasing the phonon scattering from low temperature up to\nroom temperature experiments. It is shown that playing with the geometry\n(constriction, periodic structures, nano-inclusions), from the ballistic to the\ndiffusive limit, the phonon thermal transport can be severely altered in single\ncrystalline semiconducting structures; the phonon mean free path being in\nconsequence reduced. The diverse implications on thermoelectric properties will\nbe eventually discussed.\n", "  Transport properties of 2D materials especially close to their boundary has\nreceived much attention after the successful fabrication of graphene and other\nfascinating materials afterwards. While most previous work is devoted to the\nconventional lead-device-lead setup with a finite size center area, this\nproject investigates real space transport properties of infinite and\nsemi-infinite 2D system under the framework of Non-equilibrium Green function.\nThe commonly used method of calculating the Green function by inverting a\nmatrix in the real space directly can be unstable in dealing with large systems\nas sometimes it gives non-converging result. Not to mention that the\ncalculation error and time increase drastically with size of the system. By\ntransforming from the real space to momentum space, we managed to replace the\nmatrix inverting process by Brillouin Zone integral process which can be\ngreatly simplified by the application of contour integral. Combining this\nmethodology with Dyson equations, we are able to calculate transport properties\nof semi-infinite graphene close to its zigzag boundary and its combination with\nother material including s-wave superconductor. Interference pattern of\ntransmitted and reflected electrons, graphene lensing effects and difference\nbetween Specular Andreev reflection and normal Andreev reflection are verified\nthrough our calculation.\n", "  Using thin shell formalism we construct two solutions of intra-universe\nwormholes. The first model is a cosmological analog of the Aichelburg-Schein\ntimehole, while another one is an intra-universe form of the Bronnikov-Ellis\nsolution.\n", "  The paper is focused on the discussion of the phenomenon of transitional\nchaos in dynamic autonomous and non-autonomous systems. This phenomenon\ninvolves the disappearance of chaotic oscillations in specific time periods and\nthe system becoming predictable. Variable dynamics of the system may be used to\ncontrol the process.\n", "  Since there is 3P2 neutron superfluid in neutron star interior, it can be\ntreated as a system of magnetic dipoles. Under the presence of background\nmagnetic field, the magnetic dipoles tend to align in the same direction. When\nthe temperature is lower than 10**7K, the strong magnetic fields of the\nmagnetars may originate from the induced magnetic moment of the 3P2 neutron\nCooper pairs in the anisotropic neutron superfluid. And this gives a convenient\nexplanation of the strong magnetic field of magnetars.\n", "  In this paper we discuss in detail the quantization of Landau energy levels\nof a strongly magnetized and completely degenerate relativistic electron gas in\nneutron stars. In particular, we focus on the Fermi energy dependence of the\nmagnetic field for a relativistic electron gas in the superstrong magnetic\nfield of magnetars. We would like to point out that some of the results\nconcerning the microscopic number density of states of a strongly magnetized\nelectron gas given by well-known statistical physics text books are incorrect.\nThe repeated use of these results in the last five decades probably seriously\naffects the physics of neutron stars and magnetars. The quantization of Landau\nenergy levels is accurately delineated in terms of the Dirac (delta) function.\nRelatively simple calculation shows that the Fermi energy of relativistic\nelectron gas in magnetars with superstrong magnetic fields( B > Bcr , here Bcr\nis the Landau critical magnetic field) increases with magnetic fieldstrength as\nB**(1/4). On the basis of this simple but importantnew result we are leading\nnaturally to propose a new mechanism for the production of high X-ray\nluminosity from magnetars.\n", "  Worldline holography states that within the framework of the worldline\napproach to quantum field theory, sources of a quantum field theory over\nMink$_4$ naturally form a field theory over AdS$_5$ {\\sl to all orders} in the\nelementary fields and in the sources of arbitrary spin. (Such correspondences\nare also available for other pairs of spacetimes, not only\nMink$_4\\leftrightarrow\\mathrm{AdS}_5$.) Schwinger's proper time of the\nworldline formalism is automatically grouped with the physical four spacetime\ndimensions into an AdS$_5$ geometry. We show that the worldline holographic\neffective action in general and the proper-time profiles of the sources in\nparticular solve a renormalisation group equation and, reversely, can be\ndefined as solution to the latter. This fact also ensures regulator\nindependence.\n", "  The focus of this paper is the derivation of a non-standard model for\nmicrobial enhanced oil recovery (MEOR) that includes the interfacial area (IFA)\nbetween the oil and water. We consider the continuity equations for water and\noil, a balance equation for the oil-water interface and advective-dispersive\ntransport equations for bacteria, nutrients and surfactants. Surfactants lower\nthe interfacial tension (IFT), which improves the oil recovery. Therefore, we\ninclude in the model parameterizations of the IFT reduction and residual oil\nsaturation as a function of the surfactant concentration. We consider for the\nfirst time in context of MEOR, the role of IFA in enhanced oil recovery (EOR).\nThe motivation to include the IFA in the model is to reduce the hysteresis in\nthe capillary pressure relationship, include the effects of observed bacteria\nmigration towards the oil-water interface and biological production of\nsurfactants at the oil-water interface. An efficient and robust linearization\nscheme was implemented, in which we use an implicit scheme that considers a\nlinear approximation of the capillary pressure gradient, resulting in an\nefficient and stable scheme. A comprehensive, 2D implementation based on\ntwo-point flux approximation (TPFA) has been achieved. Illustrative numerical\nsimulations are presented. We give an explanation of the differences in the oil\nrecovery profiles obtained when we consider the IFA and MEOR effects. The model\ncan also be used to design new experiments in order to gain a better\nunderstanding and optimization of MEOR.\n", "  Highlights are presented regarding recent developments of the kinetic theory\nof granular matter. These concern the discovery of an exact kinetic equation\nand a related exact H-theorem both holding for finite $N-$body systems formed\nby smooth hard-spheres systems.\n", "  We derive analytic approximations of neutrino luminosities and heat\ncapacities of neutron stars with nucleon cores valid for a wide class of\nequations of state of dense nucleon matter. The neutrino luminosities are\napproximated for the three cases in which they are produced by (i) direct Urca\nor (ii) modified Urca processes in non-superfluid matter, or (iii)\nneutrino-pair bremsstrahlung in neutron-neutron collisions (when other neutrino\nreactions are suppressed by strong proton superfluidity). The heat capacity is\napproximated for the two cases of (i) non-superfluid cores and (ii) the cores\nwith strong proton superfluidity. The results can greatly simplify numerical\nsimulations of cooling neutron stars with isothermal interiors at the neutrino\nand photon cooling stages as well as simulations of quasi-stationary internal\nthermal states of neutron stars in X-ray transients. For illustration, a\nmodel-independent analysis of thermal states of the latter sources is outlined.\n", "  The SPIFFI integral field spectrometer is operated as a subunit of the AO\ninstrument SINFONI on the VLT. It will be upgraded and reused as SPIFFIER in\nthe new VLT instrument ERIS. In January 2016 an early upgrade of several\noptical components was carried out to make use of new technological\ndevelopments before ERIS will be commissioned in 2020.\n  This Master's thesis focuses on the determination and detailed description of\nthe gain in performance due to the upgrade, with a particular focus on\nmeasurements of the exchanged diamond turned mirrors of SPIFFI. An analysis of\nthe surface deformation of these mirrors is done, followed by a determination\nof the resulting collimator wavefront and its influence on the line spread\nfunction of the spectrometer. A careful analysis on the shapes, the variations\nand the changes of the spectral line profiles due to the upgrade is done.\nFurthermore, the spectral resolution, the image quality an the relative pre-\nand post- upgrade throughput ratio are evaluated. Finally these observed\nquantities are linked to critical optical components that limit the performance\nof the instrument.\n", "  We study supernova ejecta-companion interactions in a sample of realistic\nsemidetached binary systems representative of Type Ia supernova progenitor\nbinaries in a single-degenerate scenario. We model the interaction process with\nthe help of a high-resolution hydrodynamic code assuming cylindrical symmetry.\nWe find that the ejecta hole has a half-opening angle of 40--50$^\\circ$ with\nthe density by a factor of 2-4 lower, in good agreement with the previous\nstudies. Quantitative differences from the past results in the amounts and\nkinematics of the stripped companion material and levels of contamination of\nthe companion with the ejecta material can be explained by different model\nassumptions and effects due to numerical diffusion.We analyse and, for the\nfirst time, provide simulation-based estimates of the amounts and of the\nthermal characteristics of the shock-heated material responsible for producing\na prompt, soft X-ray emission. Besides the shocked ejecta material, considered\nin the original model by Kasen, we also account for the stripped, shock-heated\nenvelope material of stellar companions, which we predict partially contributes\nto the prompt emission. The amount of the energy deposited in the envelope is\ncomparable to the energy stored in the ejecta. The total energy budget\navailable for the prompt emission is by a factor of about 2-4 smaller than\noriginally predicted by Kasen. Although the shocked envelope has a higher\ncharacteristic temperature than the shocked ejecta, the temperature estimates\nof the shocked material are in good agreement with the Kasen's model. The\nhottest shocked plasma is produced in the subgiant companion case.\n", "  By means of magnetization, specific heat and muon-spin relaxation\nmeasurements, we investigate high-pressure oxidized \\mohpo, in which overdoping\nis achieved up to $p \\sim 0.45$ hole/Cu, well beyond the $T_c - p$\nsuperconducting dome of cuprates, where Fermi liquid behavior is expected.\nSurprisingly, we find bulk superconductivity with $T_c$=84 K and superfluid\ndensity similar to those of optimally doped Y123. On the other hand, specific\nheat data display a large electronic contribution at low temperature,\ncomparable to that of nonsuperconducting overdoped La214. These results point\nat an unusual high-$T_c$ phase with a large fraction of unpaired holes. Further\nexperiments may assess the Fermi liquid properties of the present phase, which\nwould put into question the paradigm that the high $T_c$ of cuprates originates\nfrom a non-Fermi liquid ground state.\n", "  In this letter, we study the stability of the domain model for lithium\nintercalated graphite in stages III and II by means of Density Functional\nTheory and Kinetic Lattice Monte Carlo simulations. We find that the domain\nmodel is either thermodynamically or kinetically stable when compared to the\nstandard model in stages III and II. The existence of domains in the\nintercalation sequence is well supported by recent high resolution transmission\nelectron microscope observations in lithiated graphite. Moreover, we predict\nthat such domain staging sequences leads to a wide range of diffusivity as\nreported in experiments.\n", "  Materials where the electron filling is close to commensurate filling provide\none of the great challenges in materials science. Several proposals of\nunconventional orderings, where the electronic liquid self-organizes into\ncomponents with distinct properties, were recently put forward, in particular\nin cuprates and pnictides where electronic nematic orders have been observed.\nThe electrons self-organization is expected to yield complex intra and inter\nunit cell patterns, and a reduction of dimensionality. Nevertheless, an\nunambiguous experimental proof of such complex orders, namely the direct\nobservation of distinct dispersions, is still missing. Here we report a Nano\nAngle Resolved Photo-emission Spectroscopy (Nano-ARPES) study of NbSe$_3$, a\nmaterial that has been considered a paradigm of charge order. The new data\n(Fig.1) invalidate the canonical picture of imperfect nesting and reveals the\nemergence of a novel order. The electrons self-organization uncovers the\none-dimensional (1D) physics hidden in a material which naively should be the\nmost 3D of all columnar chalcogenides.\n", "  We present the time series analysis of seven B-type stars (HD 121790, HD\n122980, HD 129116, HD 133242, HD 144294, HD 145482, and HD 145502) observed\nwith the BRITE satellites. Furthermore, we located these stars in the\nHertzsprung-Russell-diagram. One rotational induced variable (HD 122980, P~80\nd) and one binary (HD 145502, P~5.6 d) showing variability due to ellipsoidal\nvariation and/or reflection were detected.\n", "  We consider the Bose-Hubbard model. Our focus is on many-body localization,\nwhich was described by many authors in such models, even in the absence of\ndisorder. Since our work is rigorous, and since we believe that the\nlocalization in this type of models is not strictly valid in the infinite-time\nlimit, we necessarily restrict our study to 'asymptotic localization': We prove\nthat transport and thermalization are small beyond perturbation theory in the\nlimit of large particle density. Our theorem takes the form of a many-body\nNekhoroshev estimate. An interesting and new aspect of this model is the\nfollowing: even though our analysis proceeds by perturbation in the hopping,\nthe localization can not be inferred from a lack of hybridization between\nzero-hopping eigenstates.\n", "  Photometric and spectroscopic observations of type Ia supernova 2015bp are\npresented, spanning $\\sim -6$ to $\\sim +141$ days since $B$-band maximum. Also\npresented are unpublished HCT spectra of type Ia iPTF13ebh between $-11$ to +34\ndays since $B$-band maximum. SN 2015bp shows rapidly declining light curves\nwith $\\Delta m_{15}(B)=1.72 \\pm 0.04$. The $I$-band light curve shows a clear\nsecondary maximum and peaks before the $B$-band maximum, placing SN 2015bp in\nthe transitional category of SNe Ia. The spectral evolution of SN 2015bp\nresembles other transitional SNe Ia rather than 1991bg-like events. The C~{\\sc\nii} $\\lambda 6580$ feature is detected in both SN 2015bp and iPTF13ebh, though\nit is present till the epoch of $B$-band maximum in the case of SN 2015bp. The\nvelocity gradients of Si~{\\sc ii} $\\lambda 6355$ place SN 2015bp and iPTF13ebh\nin the FAINT subclass, whereas pseudo-equivalent widths of Si~{\\sc ii} features\nplace them in the Cool (CL) subclass of SNe Ia. The bolometric light curve of\nSN 2015bp indicates that $\\sim 0.2$ M$_{\\odot}$ of $^{56}$Ni was synthesized in\nthe explosion, with a total ejected mass of $\\sim 0.9$ M$_{\\odot}$, suggesting\na sub-Chandrasekhar mass white dwarf progenitor.\n", "  Bi$_2$Se$_3$ is a topological insulator and it is often doped with Te to\ncompensate the $n$-type carriers due to Se vacancies. Different doping patterns\nof Te would influence the transport characteristics of the surface states. We\nstudy the Te atom distribution in Bi$_2$Se$_3$ with different Te\nconcentrations, using first-principles density-functional-theory calculations.\nWe show that Te prefer the outer layer, until the composition becomes\nBi$_2$SeTe$_2$ and the outer layer is full of Te. And for a fixed ratio of Se\nand Te atoms within a single layer, we find that the structures with less\nnumber of adjacent Te-Se pairs tend to have lower energies. This might result\nin the formation of local Te clusters under low annealing temperatures.\n", "  Quantum annealing is a generic solver of the optimization problem that uses\nfictitious quantum fluctuation. Its simulation in classical computing is often\nperformed using the quantum Monte Carlo simulation via the Suzuki--Trotter\ndecomposition. However, the negative sign problem sometimes emerges in the\nsimulation of quantum annealing with an elaborate driver Hamiltonian, since it\nbelongs to a class of non-stoquastic Hamiltonians. In the present study, we\npropose an alternative way to avoid the negative sign problem involved in a\nparticular class of the non-stoquastic Hamiltonians. To check the validity of\nthe method, we demonstrate our method by applying it to a simple problem that\nincludes the anti-ferromagnetic XX interaction, which is a typical instance of\nthe non-stoquastic Hamiltonians.\n", "  Introductory lectures (delivered at TASI, June 1994) on heavy quarks and\nheavy quark effective field theory. Applications to inclusive semileptonic\ndecays and to interactions with light mesons are covered in detail.\n"]}
