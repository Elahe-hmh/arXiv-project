Abbott Ed. (World\nScientific, Singapore, 2007).\n", "  Molecular biology is a nanotechnology that works--it has worked for billions\nof years and in an amazing variety of circumstances. At its core is a system\nfor acquiring, processing and communicating information that is universal, from\nviruses and bacteria to human beings. Advances in genetics and experience in\ndesigning computers have taken us to a stage where we can understand the\noptimisation principles at the root of this system, from the availability of\nbasic building blocks to the execution of tasks. The languages of DNA and\nproteins are argued to be the optimal solutions to the information processing\ntasks they carry out. The analysis also suggests simpler predecessors to these\nlanguages, and provides fascinating clues about their origin. Obviously, a\ncomprehensive unraveling of the puzzle of life would have a lot to say about\nwhat we may design or convert ourselves into.\n", "  In evolutionary game theory an Evolutionarily Stable Strategy (ESS) is a\nrefinement of the Nash equilibrium concept that is sometimes also recognized as\nevolutionary stability. It is a game-theoretic model, well known to\nmathematical biologists, that was found quite useful in the understanding of\nevolutionary dynamics of a population. This chapter presents an analysis of\nevolutionary stability in the emerging field of quantum games.\n", "  Let N(f) be a number of nodal domains of a random Gaussian spherical harmonic\nf of degree n. We prove that as n grows to infinity, the mean of N(f)/n^2 tends\nto a positive constant, and that N(f)/n^2 exponentially concentrates around\nthat constant.\n  This result is consistent with predictions made by Bogomolny and Schmit using\na percolation-like model for nodal domains of random Gaussian plane waves.\n", "  By random complex zeroes we mean the zero set of a random entire function\nwhose Taylor coefficients are independent complex-valued Gaussian variables,\nand the variance of the k-th coefficient is 1/k!. This zero set is distribution\ninvariant with respect to isometries of the complex plane. We study large\nfluctuations of random complex zeroes and show that they obey the asymptotic\nlaw that was discovered some time ago by Jancovici, Lebowitz and Manificat for\ncharge fluctuations of a Coulomb system of particles.\n", "  Quantum counterparts of certain simple classical systems can exhibit chaotic\nbehaviour through the statistics of their energy levels and the irregular\nspectra of chaotic systems are modelled by eigenvalues of infinite random\nmatrices. We use known bounds on the distribution function for eigenvalue\nspacings for the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble (GOE) of infinite random real\nsymmetric matrices and show that gamma distributions, which have an important\nuniqueness property, can yield an approximation to the GOE distribution. That\nhas the advantage that then both chaotic and non chaotic cases fit in the\ninformation geometric framework of the manifold of gamma distributions, which\nhas been the subject of recent work on neighbourhoods of randomness for general\nstochastic systems. Additionally, gamma distributions give approximations, to\neigenvalue spacings for the Gaussian unitary ensemble (GUE) of infinite random\nhermitian matrices and for the Gaussian symplectic ensemble (GSE) of infinite\nrandom hermitian matrices with real quaternionic elements, except near the\norigin. Gamma distributions do not precisely model the various analytic systems\ndiscussed here, but some features may be useful in studies of qualitative\ngeneric properties in applications to data from real systems which manifestly\nseem to exhibit behaviour reminiscent of near-random processes.\n", "  Using confocal Raman and fluorescence spectroscopic imaging in 3-dimensions,\nwe show direct evidence for Nd3+-Nd3+ interactions across grain boundaries\n(GBs) in Nd3+:YAG laser ceramics. It is clearly shown that Nd3+ segregation\ntakes place at GBs leading to self-fluorescence quenching which affects a\nvolume fraction as high as 20%. In addition, we show a clear trend of\nincreasing spatial inhomogeneities in Nd3+ concentration when the doping levels\nexceeds 3 at%, which is not detected by standard spectrometry techniques. These\nresults could point the way to further improvements in what is already an\nimpressive class of ceramic laser materials.\n", "  We study the resonant transmission of light in a coupled-resonator optical\nwaveguide interacting with two nearly identical side cavities. We reveal and\ndescribe a novel effect of the coupled-resonator-induced reflection (CRIR)\ncharacterized by a very high and easily tunable quality factor of the\nreflection line, for the case of the inter-site coupling between the cavities\nand the waveguide. This effect differs sharply from the\ncoupled-resonator-induced transparency (CRIT) -- an all-optical analogue of the\nelectromagnetically-induced transparency -- which has recently been studied\ntheoretically and observed experimentally for the structures based on\nmicro-ring resonators and photonic crystal cavities. Both CRIR and CRIT effects\nhave the same physical origin which can be attributed to the Fano-Feshbach\nresonances in the systems exhibiting more than one resonance. We discuss the\napplicability of the novel CRIR effect to the control of the slow-light\npropagation and low-threshold all-optical switching.\n", "  The method of surrogates is widely used in the field of nonlinear data\nanalysis for testing for weak nonlinearities. The two most commonly used\nalgorithms for generating surrogates are the amplitude adjusted Fourier\ntransform (AAFT) and the iterated amplitude adjusted Fourier transfom (IAAFT)\nalgorithm. Both the AAFT and IAAFT algorithm conserve the amplitude\ndistribution in real space and reproduce the power spectrum (PS) of the\noriginal data set very accurately. The basic assumption in both algorithms is\nthat higher-order correlations can be wiped out using a Fourier phase\nrandomization procedure. In both cases, however, the randomness of the Fourier\nphases is only imposed before the (first) Fourier back tranformation. Until\nnow, it has not been studied how the subsequent remapping and iteration steps\nmay affect the randomness of the phases. Using the Lorenz system as an example,\nwe show that both algorithms may create surrogate realizations containing\nFourier phase correlations. We present two new iterative surrogate data\ngenerating methods being able to control the randomization of Fourier phases at\nevery iteration step. The resulting surrogate realizations which are truly\nlinear by construction display all properties needed for surrogate data.\n", "  We review the current status of theoretical calculations of the hadronic\nlight-by-light scattering contribution to the muon anomalous magnetic moment.\nDifferent approaches and related issues such as OPE constraints and large\nbreaking of chiral symmetry are discussed. Combining results of different\nmodels with educated guesses on the errors we come to the estimate $$a^{\\rm\nHLbL}=(10.5\\pm 2.6)\\times 10^{-10}.$$ The text is prepared as a contribution to\nthe {\\it Glasgow White Paper on the present status of the Muon Anomalous\nMagnetic Moment}.\n", "  We discuss one of the most interesting phenomena exhibited by baby skyrmions\n-- breaking of rotational symmetry. The topics we will deal with here include\nthe appearance of rotational symmetry breaking in the static solutions of baby\nSkyrme models, both in flat as well as in curved spaces, the zero-temperature\ncrystalline structure of baby skyrmions, and finally, the appearance of\nspontaneous breaking of rotational symmetry in rotating baby skyrmions.\n", "  Dimensionally reduced spherically symmetric gravity and its generalization,\ngeneric 2-D dilaton gravity, provide ideal theoretical laboratories for the\nstudy of black hole quantum mechanics and thermodynamics. They are sufficiently\nsimple to be tractable but contain enough structure to allow the study of many\ndeep issues in quantum gravity, such as the endpoint of Hawking radiation and\nthe source of black hole entropy. This article reviews recent progress in a\nparticular geometrical approach to the study of quantum black holes in generic\n2-d dilaton gravity.\n", "  In this short article accessible for non-experts I discuss possible ways of\nconstructing a non-commutative gravity paying special attention to\npossibilities of realizing the full diffeomorphism symmetry and to relations\nwith 2D gravities.\n", "  We review our work of the past decade on one-loop quantum corrections to the\nmass M and central charge Z of solitons in supersymmetric field theories: the\nkink, the vortex, and the monopoles (focussing on the kink and the monopoles\nhere). In each case a new feature was needed to obtain BPS saturation: a new\nanomaly-like contribution to Z for the kink and the N=2 monopole, the effect of\nclassical winding of the quantum vortex contributing to Z, surface terms\ncontributing to M of the N=4 monopole and to Z of the N=2 and N=4 monopoles,\nand composite operator renormalization for the currents of the \"finite\" N=4\nmodel. We use dimensional regularization, modified to preserve susy and be\napplicable to solitons, and suitable renormalization conditions. In the mode\nexpansion of bosonic and fermionic quantum fields, zero modes appear then as\nmassless nonzero modes.\n", "  I review, in a personal perspective, the history of the theory of\nnon-relativistic bound states in QED and QCD from the Bethe-Salpeter equation\nto the construction of effective field theories.\n", "  We review methods developed in the gauge-string duality to treat energy loss\nby energetic probes of a strongly coupled thermal medium. After introducing the\nblack hole description of the thermal medium, we discuss the trailing string\nbehind a heavy quark and the drag force that it implies. We then explain how to\nsolve the linearized Einstein equations in the presence of the trailing string\nand extract from the solutions the energy density and the Poynting vector of\nthe dual gauge theory. We summarize some efforts to compare these calculations\nto heavy ion phenomenology.\n", "  We review baryons in the D4-D8 holographic model of low energy QCD, with the\nlarge $N_c$ and the large 't Hooft coupling limit. The baryon is identified\nwith a bulk soliton of a unit Pontryagin number, which from the\nfour-dimensional viewpoint translates to a heavily modified Skyrmion dressed by\ncondensates of spin one mesons. We explore classical properties and find that\nthe baryon in the holographic limit is amenable to an effective field theory\ndescription. We also present a simple method to capture all leading and\nsubleading interactions in the $1/N_c$ and the derivative expansions. An\ninfinitely predictive model of baryon-meson interactions is thus derived,\nalthough one may trust results only for low energy processes, given various\napproximations in the bulk. We showcase a few comparisons to experiments, such\nthe leading axial couplings to pions, the leading vector-like coupling, and a\nqualitative prediction of the electromagnetic vector dominance that involves\nthe entire tower of vector mesons. (This article is an expanded version of a\nproceeding contribution to \"30 years of mathematical method in high energy\nphysics,\" Kyoto 2008)\n", "  Heavy-flavor particles are believed to provide valuable probes of the medium\nproduced in ultrarelativistic collisions of heavy nuclei. In this article we\nreview recent progress in our understanding of the interactions of charm and\nbottom quarks in the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP). For individual heavy quarks, we\nfocus on elastic interactions for which the large quark mass enables a Brownian\nmotion treatment. This opens a unique access to thermalization mechanisms for\nheavy quarks at low momentum, and thus to their transport coefficients in the\nquark-gluon fluid. Different approaches to evaluate heavy-quark diffusion are\ndiscussed and compared, including perturbative QCD, effective potential models\nutilizing input from lattice QCD and string-theoretic estimates in conformal\nfield theories. Applications to heavy-quark observables in heavy-ion collisions\nare realized via relativistic Langevin simulations, where we illustrate the\nimportant role of a realistic medium evolution to quantitatively extract the\nheavy-quark diffusion constant. In the heavy quarkonium sector, we briefly\nreview the current status in potential-model based interpretations of\ncorrelation functions computed in lattice QCD, followed by an evaluation of\nquarkonium dissociation reactions in the QGP. The discussion of the\nphenomenology in heavy-ion reactions focuses on thermal model frameworks\nparalleling the open heavy-flavor sector. We also emphasize connections to the\nheavy-quark diffusion problem in both potential models and quarkonium\nregeneration processes.\n", "  I review the main predictions for the heavy-ion programme at the Large Hadron\nCollider (LHC) at CERN, as available in early April 2009. I begin by\nremembering the standard claims made in view of the experimental data measured\nat the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) at CERN and at the Relativistic Heavy Ion\nCollider (RHIC) at the BNL. These claims will be used for later discussion of\nthe new opportunities at the LHC. Next I review the generic, qualitative\nexpectations for the LHC. Then I turn to quantitative predictions: First I\nanalyze observables which characterize directly the medium produced in the\ncollisions - bulk observables or soft probes -: multiplicities, collective\nflow, hadrochemistry at low transverse momentum, correlations and fluctuations.\nSecond, I move to calibrated probes of the medium i.e. typically those whose\nexpectation in the absence of any medium can be described in Quantum\nChromodynamics (QCD) using perturbative techniques (pQCD), usually called hard\nprobes. I discuss particle production at large transverse momentum and jets,\nheavy-quark and quarkonium production, and photons and dileptons. Finally,\nafter a brief review of pA collisions, I end with a summary and a discussion\nabout the potentiality of the measurements at the LHC - particularly those made\nduring the first run - to further substantiate or, on the contrary, disproof\nthe picture of the medium that has arisen from the confrontation between the\nSPS and RHIC data, and theoretical models.\n", "  We review an alternative formulation of gauge field theories at finite\ntemperature where unphysical degrees of freedom of gauge fields and the\nFaddeev-Popov ghosts are kept at zero temperature.\n", "  The Cheshire cat principle states that hadronic observables at low energy do\nnot distinguish between hard (quark) or soft (meson) constituents. As a result,\nthe delineation between hard/soft (bag radius) is like the Cheshire cat smile\nin Alice in wonderland. This principle reemerges from current holographic\ndescriptions of chiral baryons whereby the smile appears in the holographic\ndirection. We illustrate this point for the baryonic form factor.\n", "  We show that in analogy to the introduction of Poisson structures twisted by\na closed 3-form by Park and Klimcik-Strobl, the study of three dimensional\nsigma models with Wess-Zumino term leads in a likewise way to twisting of\nCourant algebroid structures by closed 4-forms H.\n  The presentation is kept pedagogical and accessible to physicists as well as\nto mathematicians, explaining in detail in particular the interplay of field\ntransformations in a sigma model with the type of geometrical structures\ninduced on a target. In fact, as we also show, even if one does not know the\nmathematical concept of a Courant algebroid, the study of a rather general\nclass of 3-dimensional sigma models leads one to that notion by itself.\n  Courant algebroids became of relevance for mathematical physics lately from\nseveral perspectives - like for example by means of using generalized complex\nstructures in String Theory. One may expect that their twisting by the\ncurvature H of some 3-form Ramond-Ramond gauge field will become of relevance\nas well.\n", "  We discuss properties of heavy quarkonium states at high temperatures based\non lattice QCD and potential models. We review recent progress made in lattice\ncalculations of spatial static quark anti-quark correlators as well as\nquarkonium correlators in Euclidean time. Recent developments in effective\nfield theory approach and potential models are also discussed.\n", "  Hadron correlations in jets, ridges and opposite dijets at all $p_T$ above 2\nGeV/c are discussed. Since abundant data are available from RHIC at\nintermediate $p_T$, a reliable hadronization scheme at that $p_T$ range is\nnecessary in order to relate the semihard partonic processes to the\nobservables. The recombination model is therefore first reviewed for that\npurpose. Final-state interaction is shown to be important for the Cronin\neffect, large B/M ratio and forward production. The effect of semihard partons\non the medium is then discussed with particular emphasis on the formation of\nridge with or without trigger. Azimuthal anisotropy can result from ridges\nwithout early thermalization. Dynamical path length distribution is derived for\nany centrality. Dihadron correlations in jets on the same or opposite side are\nshown to reveal detail properties of trigger and antitrigger biases with the\ninference that tangential jets dominate the dijets accessible to observation.\n", "  We review the procedure to calculate baryonic properties using a recently\nproposed five-dimensional approach to QCD. We show that this method give\npredictions to baryon observables that agree reasonable well with the\nexperimental data.\n", "  On the sad occasion of contributing to the memorial volume ``Fundamental\nInteractions'' for my teacher Wolfgang Kummer I decided to recollect and extend\nsome unpublished notes from the mid 90s when I started to build up a string\ntheory group in Vienna under Wolfgang as head of the particle physics group.\nHis extremely supportive attitude was best expressed by his saying that one\nshould let all flowers flourish. I hope that these notes will be useful in\nparticular in view of the current renewed interest in heterotic model building.\nThe content of this contribution is based on the bridge between exact CFT and\ngeometric techniques that is provided by the orbifold interpretation of simple\ncurrent modular invariants. After reformulating the Gepner construction in this\nlanguage I describe the generalization to heterotic (0,2) models and its\napplication to the Geometry/CFT equivalence between Gepner-type and\nDistler-Kachru models that was proposed by Blumenhagen, Schimmrigk and\nWisskirchen. We analyze a series of solutions to the anomaly equations, discuss\nthe issue of mirror symmetry, and use the extended Poincar\\'e polynomial to\nextend the construction to Landau-Ginzburg models beyond the realm of rational\nCFTs. In the appendix we discuss Gepner points in torus orbifolds, which\nprovide further relations to free bosons and free fermions, as well as - simple\ncurrents in N=2 SCFTs and minimal models.\n", "  Here I review measurements of v2, the second component in a Fourier\ndecomposition of the azimuthal dependence of particle production relative to\nthe reaction plane in heavy-ion collisions. v2 is an observable central to the\ninterpretation of the subsequent expansion of heavy-ion collisions. Its large\nvalue indicates significant space-momentum correlations, consistent with the\nrapid expansion of a strongly interacting Quark Gluon Plasma. Data is reviewed\nfor collision energies from sqrt[sNN] = 2 to 200 GeV. Scaling observations and\ncomparisons to hydrodynamic models are discussed.\n", "  The hadronic matter described as a skyrmion matter embedded in an FCC crystal\nis found to turn into a half-skyrmion matter with vanishing (in the chiral\nlimit) quark condensate and {\\em non-vanishing} pion decay constant at a\ndensity $n_{1/2S}$ lower than or at the critical density $n_c^{\\chi SR}$ at\nwhich hadronic matter changes over to a chiral symmetry restored phase with\ndeconfined quarks. When hidden local gauge fields and dilaton scalars -- one\n\"soft\" and one \"hard\" -- are incorporated, this phase is characterized by\n$a=1$, $f_\\pi\\neq 0$ with the hidden gauge coupling $g\\neq 0$ but $\\ll 1$.\nWhile chiral symmetry is restored in this region in the sense that\n$\\la\\bar{q}q\\ra=0$, quarks are still confined in massive hadrons and massless\npions. This phase seems to correspond to the \"quarkyonic phase\" predicted in\nlarge $N_c$ QCD. It also represents the \"hadronic freedom\" regime relevant to\nkaon condensation at compact-star density. As $g\\to 0$ (in the chiral limit),\nthe symmetry \"swells\" -- as an emergent symmetry due to medium -- to\n$SU(N_f)^4$ as proposed by Georgi for the \"vector limit.\" The fractionization\nof skyrmion matter into half-skyrmion matter is analogous to what appears to\nhappen in condensed matter in (2+1) dimensions where half-skyrmions or \"merons\"\nenter as relevant degrees of freedom at the interface. Finally the transition\nfrom baryonic matter to color-flavor-locked quark matter can be bridged by a\nhalf-skyrmion matter.\n", "  The cosmological principle says that the Universe is spatially homogeneous\nand isotropic. It predicts, among other phenomena, the cosmic redshift of light\nand the Hubble law. Nevertheless, the existence of structure in the Universe\nviolates the (exact) cosmological principle. A more precise formulation of the\ncosmological principle must allow for the formation of structure and must\ntherefore incorporate probability distributions. In this contribution to the\nMemorial Volume for Wolfgang Kummer, a great teacher and mentor to me, I\ndiscuss how we could formulate a new version of the cosmological principle, how\nto test it, and how to possibly justify it by fundamental physics. My\ncontribution starts with some of my memories of Wolfgang.\n", "  One of the most striking results from the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider is\nthe strong elliptic flow. This review summarizes what is observed and how these\nresults are combined with reasonable theoretical assumptions to estimate the\nshear viscosity of QCD near the phase transition. A data comparison with\nviscous hydrodynamics and kinetic theory calculations indicates that the shear\nviscosity to entropy ratio is surprisingly small, $\\eta/s < 0.4$. The preferred\nrange is $\\eta/s \\simeq (1\\leftrightarrow 3) \\times 1/4\\pi$.\n", "  The description of the heavy baryons as heavy-meson--soliton bound systems is\nreviewed. We outline how such bound systems arise from effective lagrangians\nthat respect both chiral symmetry and heavy quark symmetry. Effects due to\nfinite heavy quark masses are also discussed, and the resulting heavy baryon\nspectra are compared with existing quark model and empirical results. Finally,\nwe address some issues related to a possible connection between the usual bound\nstate approach to strange hyperons and that for heavier baryons.\n", "  We review an approach, developed over the past few years, to describe\nhadronic matter at finite density and temperature, whose underlying theoretical\nframework is the Skyrme model, an effective low energy theory rooted in large\n$N_c$ QCD. In this approach matter is described by various crystal structures\nof skyrmions, classical topological solitons carrying baryon number, from which\nconventional baryons appear by quantization. Chiral and scale symmetries play a\ncrucial role in the dynamics as described by pion, dilaton and vector meson\ndegrees of freedom. When compressed or heated skyrmion matter describes a rich\nphase diagram which has strong connections with the confinement/deconfinement\nphase transition.\n", "  We develop a statistical theory that describes quantum-mechanical scattering\nof a particle by a cavity when the geometry is such that the classical dynamics\nis chaotic. This picture is relevant to a variety of physical systems, ranging\nfrom atomic nuclei to mesoscopic systems and microwave cavities; the main\napplication to be discussed in this contribution is to electronic transport\nthrough mesoscopic ballistic structures or quantum dots. The theory describes\nthe regime in which there are two distinct time scales, associated with a\nprompt and an equilibrated response, and is cast in terms of the matrix of\nscattering amplitudes S. We construct the ensemble of S matrices using a\nmaximum-entropy approach which incorporates the requirements of flux\nconservation, causality and ergodicity, and the system-specific average of S\nwhich quantifies the effect of prompt processes. The resulting ensemble, known\nas Poisson's kernel, is meant to describe those situations in which any other\ninformation is irrelevant. The results of this formulation have been compared\nwith the numerical solution of the Schroedinger equation for cavities in which\nthe assumptions of the theory hold. The model has a remarkable predictive\npower: it describes statistical properties of the quantum conductance of\nquantum dots, like its average, its fluctuations, and its full distribution in\nseveral cases. We also discuss situations that have been found recently, in\nwhich the notion of stationarity and ergodicity is not fulfilled, and yet\nPoisson's kernel gives a good description of the data. At the present moment we\nare unable to give an explanation of this fact.\n", "  We review the half-Skyrmion theory for copper-oxide high-temperature\nsuperconductivity. In the theory, doped holes create a half-Skyrmion spin\ntexture which is characterized by a topological charge. The formation of the\nhalf-Skyrmion is described in the single hole doped system, and then the\nhalf-Skyrmion excitation spectrum is compared with the angle-resolved\nphotoemission spectroscopy results in the undoped system. Multi-half-Skyrmion\nconfigurations are studied by numerical simulations. We show that\nhalf-Skyrmions carry non-vanishing topological charge density below a critical\nhole doping concentration \\sim 30% even in the absence of antiferromagnetic\nlong-range order. The magnetic structure factor exhibits incommensurate peaks\nin stripe ordered configurations of half-Skyrmions and anti-half-Skyrmions. The\ninteraction mediated by half-Skyrmions leads to d_{x^2-y^2}-wave\nsuperconductivity. We also describe pseudogap behavior arising from the\nexcitation spectrum of a composite particle of a half-Skyrmion and doped hole.\n", "  We consider a system of particles subjected to a uniform external force E and\nundergoing random collisions with \"virtual\" fixed obstacles, as in the Drude\nmodel of conductivity. The system is maintained in a nonequilibrium stationary\nstate by a Gaussian thermostat. In a suitable limit the system is described by\na self consistent Boltzmann equation for the one particle distribution function\nf. We find that after a long time f(v,t) approaches a stationary velocity\ndistribution f(v) which vanishes for large speeds, i.e. f(v)=0 for |v|>vmax(E),\nwith vmax(E)~1/|E| as |E| -> 0. In that limit f(v)~exp(-c|v|^3) for fixed v,\nwhere c depends on mean free path of the particle. f(v) is computed explicitly\nin one dimension.\n", "  The chaotic transport of charged particles in a turbulent electrostatic\npotential sets the conditions of a severe limitation to the plasma confinement\nin devices such as tokamaks. In this chapter, we consider the motion of\nimpurities driven by the ExB velocity where a strong magnetic field B (which\nallows for the guiding center approximation) is uniform and constant, and a\nturbulent electric field is obtained from models or from numerical fluid codes.\nHamiltonian dynamics rule the transport properties of these impurities.\nTherefore a technique to reduce chaotic diffusion in Hamiltonian systems is\nable to address the issue of reducing the radial transport of impurities under\nsome approximations. The general idea is to build barriers in phase space by a\nsmall and apt modification of the Hamiltonian. We show numerically that such\nperturbations are able to drastically reduce the diffusion of test-particles,\nand we discuss the robustness of such additional modifications.\n", "  We investigate the synchronization dynamics of two coupled noise-driven\nFitzHugh-Nagumo systems, representing two neural populations. For certain\nchoices of the noise intensities and coupling strength, we find cooperative\nstochastic dynamics such as frequency synchronization and phase\nsynchronization, where the degree of synchronization can be quantified by the\nratio of the interspike interval of the two excitable neural populations and\nthe phase synchronization index, respectively. The stochastic synchronization\ncan be either enhanced or suppressed by local time-delayed feedback control,\ndepending upon the delay time and the coupling strength. The control depends\ncrucially upon the coupling scheme of the control force, i.e., whether the\ncontrol force is generated from the activator or inhibitor signal, and applied\nto either component. For inhibitor self-coupling, synchronization is most\nstrongly enhanced, whereas for activator self-coupling there exist distinct\nvalues of the delay time where the synchronization is strongly suppressed even\nin the strong synchronization regime. For cross-coupling strongly modulated\nbehavior is found.\n", "  We present a variational formulation for the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ)\nequation that leads to a thermodynamic-like potential for the KPZ as well as\nfor other related kinetic equations. For the KPZ case, with the knowledge of\nsuch a potential we prove some global shift invariance properties previously\nconjectured by other authors. We also show a few results about the form of the\nstationary probability distribution function for arbitrary dimensions. The\nprocedure used for KPZ was extended in order to derive more general forms of\nsuch a functional leading to other nonlinear kinetic equations, as well as\ncases with density dependent surface tension.\n", "  A review is given of developments in supergravity unified models proposed in\n1982 and their implications for current and future experiment are discussed.\n", "  The origin of dark matter as a thermal relic offers a compelling way in which\nthe early universe was initially populated by dark matter. Alternative\nexplanations typically appear exotic compared to the simplicity of thermal\nproduction. However, recent observations and progress from theory suggest that\nit may be necessary to be more critical. This is important because ongoing\nsearches probing the microscopic properties of dark matter typically rely on\nthe assumption of dark matter as a single, unique, thermal relic. On general\ngrounds I will argue that non-thermal production of dark matter seems to be a\nrobust prediction of physics beyond the standard model. However, if such models\nare to lead to realistic phenomenology, they must sit in a restrictive\ntheoretical framework. As we will show, as a consequence of such restrictions,\nviable models will result in concrete and testable predictions. Although many\nchallenges remain, the non-thermal component of such models may offer a new way\nto test string theories that are formulated to provide realistic particle\nphysics near the electroweak scale.\n", "  I present a brief overview of a variety of computational tools for\nsupersymmetry calculations, including: spectrum generators, cross section and\nbranching fraction calculators, low energy constraints, general purpose event\ngenerators, matrix element event generators, SUSY dark matter codes, parameter\nextraction codes and Les Houches interface tools.\n", "  The screened field (forward field and wake) of a test particle moving at\nconstant velocity through an unmagnetized collisionless plasma is calculated\nanalytically and numerically. This paper is based on unpublished material from\nmy MSc thesis, supervised by the late Dr K. C. Hines.\n", "  I report, emphasizing some key open issues and some aspects that are\nparticularly relevant for phenomenology, on the status of the development of\n\"doubly-special\" relativistic (\"DSR\") theories with both an\nobserver-independent high-velocity scale and an observer-independent\nsmall-length/large-momentum scale, possibly relevant for the\nPlanck-scale/quantum-gravity realm. I also give a true/false characterization\nof the structure of these theories. In particular, I discuss a DSR scenario\nwithout modification of the energy-momentum dispersion relation and without the\n$\\kappa$-Poincar\\'e Hopf algebra, a scenario with deformed Poincar\\'e\nsymmetries which is not a DSR scenario, some scenarios with both an invariant\nlength scale and an invariant velocity scale which are not DSR scenarios, and a\nDSR scenario in which it is easy to verify that some observable relativistic\n(but non-special-relativistic) features are insensitive to possible nonlinear\nredefinitions of symmetry generators.\n", "  In these notes, we describe the recent progress in understanding the zero\nsets of two remarkable Gaussian random functions: the Gaussian entire function\nwith invariant distribution of zeroes with respect to isometries of the complex\nplane, and Gaussian spherical harmonics on the two-dimensional sphere.\n", "  By random complex zeroes we mean the zero set of a random entire function\nwhose Taylor coefficients are independent complex-valued Gaussian variables,\nand the variance of the k-th coefficient is 1/k!. This zero set is distribution\ninvariant with respect to isometries of the complex plane. Extending the\nprevious results of Sodin and Tsirelson, we compute the variance of linear\nstatistics of random complex zeroes, and find close to optimal conditions on a\ntest-function that yield asymptotic normality of fluctuations of the\ncorresponding linear statistics. We also provide examples of test-functions\nwith abnormal fluctuations of linear statistics.\n", "  In this pedagogical review, we discuss how electrical resistance can arise in\nsuperconductors. Starting with the idea of the superconducting order parameter\nas a condensate wave function, we introduce vortices as topological excitations\nwith quantized phase winding, and we show how phase slips occur when vortices\ncross the sample. Superconductors exhibit non-zero electrical resistance under\ncircumstances where phase slips occur at a finite rate. For one-dimensional\nsuperconductors or Josephson junctions, phase slips can occur at isolated\npoints in space-time. Phase slip rates may be controlled by thermal activation\nover a free-energy barrier, or in some circumstances, at low temperatures, by\nquantum tunneling through a barrier. We present an overview of several\nphenomena involving vortices that have direct implications for the electrical\nresistance of superconductors, including the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless\ntransition for vortex-proliferation in thin films, and the effects of vortex\npinning in bulk type II superconductors on the non-linear resistivity of these\nmaterials in an applied magnetic field. We discuss how quantum fluctuations can\ncause phase slips and review the non-trivial role of dissipation on such\nfluctuations. We present a basic picture of the superconductor-to-insulator\nquantum phase transitions in films, wires, and Josephson junctions. We point\nout related problems in superfluid helium films and systems of ultra-cold\ntrapped atoms. While our emphasis is on theoretical concepts, we also briefly\ndescribe experimental results, and we underline some of the open questions.\n", "  We prove strong clustering of k-point correlation functions of zeroes of\nGaussian Entire Functions. In the course of the proof, we also obtain universal\nlocal bounds for k-point functions of zeroes of arbitrary nondegenerate\nGaussian analytic functions.\n  In the second part of the paper, we show that strong clustering yields the\nasymptotic normality of fluctuations of some linear statistics of zeroes of\nGaussian Entire Functions, in particular, of the number of zeroes in measurable\ndomains of large area. This complements our recent results from the paper\n\"Fluctuations in random complex zeroes\" (arXiv:1003.4251v1).\n", "  We present an overview of our understanding of electrostatic interactions\nbetween charged macromolecular surfaces mediated by mobile counter- and coions.\nThe dichotomy between the weak and the strong coupling regimes is described in\ndetail and the way they engender repulsive and attractive interactions between\nnominally equally charged macroions. We also introduce the concept of dressed\ncounterions in the case of many-component Coulomb fluids that are partially\nweakly and partially strongly coupled to local electrostatic fields leading to\nnon-monotonic interactions between equally charged macroions. The effect of\nquenched surface charge disorder on the counterion-mediated electrostatic\ninteractions is analyzed within the same conceptual framework and shown to lead\nto unexpected and extraordinary electrostatic interactions between randomly\ncharged surfaces with equal mean surface charge densities or even between\neffectively neutral macroion surfaces. As a result, these recent developments\nchallenge some cherished notions of pop culture.\n", "  An approach, based on Jucys--Murphy elements, to the representation theory of\ncyclotomic Hecke algebras is developed. The maximality (in the cyclotomic Hecke\nalgebra) of the set of the Jucys--Murphy elements is established. A basis of\nthe cyclotomic Hecke algebra is suggested; this basis is used to establish the\nflatness of the deformation without use of the representation theory.\n", "  It is argued that the observed enhancement of the hadronic transition\nUpsilon(4S) -> Upsilon(1S) eta relative to Upsilon(4S) -> Upsilon(1S) pi pi can\nbe explained if the resonance Upsilon(4S) contains an admixture of a four-quark\ncomponent, possibly due to the coupling to the meson channel B \\bar B. A test\nof the discussed mechanism by searching for the transition Upsilon(4S) ->\nUpsilon(1S) eta'(958) is suggested. Some properties of possible four-quark\nstates related to the suggested one by the heavy quark spin symmetry are also\ndiscussed.\n", "  The essay is an attempt to re-create the wonderful scientific atmosphere that\nemerged after the basic BCS ideas first arrived in Russia in 1957. It\nsummarizes the most significant contributions to the microscopic theory of\nsuperconductivity by Russian physicists during the next few years that have\ngiven the theory its modern form.\n", "  We present and discuss a list of some interesting points that are currently\nopen in nonextensive statistical mechanics. Their analytical, numerical,\nexperimental or observational advancement would naturally be very welcome.\n", "  We investigate the phenomenon of the diffraction of charged particles by thin\nmaterial targets using the method of the de Broglie-Bohm quantum trajectories.\nThe particle wave function can be modeled as a sum of two terms\n$\\psi=\\psi_{ingoing}+\\psi_{outgoing}$. A thin separator exists between the\ndomains of prevalence of the ingoing and outgoing wavefunction terms. The\nstructure of the quantum-mechanical currents in the neighborhood of the\nseparator implies the formation of an array of \\emph{quantum vortices}. The\nflow structure around each vortex displays a characteristic pattern called\n`nodal point - X point complex'. The X point gives rise to stable and unstable\nmanifolds. We find the scaling laws characterizing a nodal point-X point\ncomplex by a local perturbation theory around the nodal point. We then analyze\nthe dynamical role of vortices in the emergence of the diffraction pattern. In\nparticular, we demonstrate the abrupt deflections, along the direction of the\nunstable manifold, of the quantum trajectories approaching an X-point along its\nstable manifold. Theoretical results are compared to numerical simulations of\nquantum trajectories. We finally calculate the {\\it times of flight} of\nparticles following quantum trajectories from the source to detectors placed at\nvarious scattering angles $\\theta$, and thereby propose an experimental test of\nthe de Broglie - Bohm formalism.\n", "  Recently, the Hamiltonian Control Theory was used in [Boreux et al.] to\nincrease the dynamic aperture of a ring particle accelerator having a localized\nthin sextupole magnet. In this letter, these results are extended by proving\nthat a simplified version of the obtained general control term leads to\nsignificant improvements of the dynamic aperture of the uncontrolled model. In\naddition, the dynamics of flat beams based on the same accelerator model can be\nsignificantly improved by a reduced controlled term applied in only 1 degree of\nfreedom.\n", "  We study some dynamical properties of a classical time-dependent elliptical\nbilliard. We consider periodically moving boundary and collisions between the\nparticle and the boundary are assumed to be elastic. Our results confirm that\nalthough the static elliptical billiard is an integrable system, after to\nintroduce time-dependent perturbation on the boundary the unlimited energy\ngrowth is observed. The behaviour of the average velocity is described using\nscaling arguments.\n", "  We study the problem of efficient integration of variational equations in\nmulti-dimensional Hamiltonian systems. For this purpose, we consider a\nRunge-Kutta-type integrator, a Taylor series expansion method and the so-called\n`Tangent Map' (TM) technique based on symplectic integration schemes, and apply\nthem to the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam $\\beta$ (FPU-$\\beta$) lattice of $N$ nonlinearly\ncoupled oscillators, with $N$ ranging from 4 to 20. The fast and accurate\nreproduction of well-known behaviors of the Generalized Alignment Index (GALI)\nchaos detection technique is used as an indicator for the efficiency of the\ntested integration schemes. Implementing the TM technique--which shows the best\nperformance among the tested algorithms--and exploiting the advantages of the\nGALI method, we successfully trace the location of low-dimensional tori.\n", "  We study chaotic orbits of conservative low--dimensional maps and present\nnumerical results showing that the probability density functions (pdfs) of the\nsum of $N$ iterates in the large $N$ limit exhibit very interesting\ntime-evolving statistics. In some cases where the chaotic layers are thin and\nthe (positive) maximal Lyapunov exponent is small, long--lasting\nquasi--stationary states (QSS) are found, whose pdfs appear to converge to\n$q$--Gaussians associated with nonextensive statistical mechanics. More\ngenerally, however, as $N$ increases, the pdfs describe a sequence of QSS that\npass from a $q$--Gaussian to an exponential shape and ultimately tend to a true\nGaussian, as orbits diffuse to larger chaotic domains and the phase space\ndynamics becomes more uniformly ergodic.\n", "  The horizontal visibility algorithm has been recently introduced as a mapping\nbetween time series and networks. The challenge lies in characterizing the\nstructure of time series (and the processes that generated those series) using\nthe powerful tools of graph theory. Recent works have shown that the visibility\ngraphs inherit several degrees of correlations from their associated series,\nand therefore such graph theoretical characterization is in principle possible.\nHowever, both the mathematical grounding of this promising theory and its\napplications are on its infancy. Following this line, here we address the\nquestion of detecting hidden periodicity in series polluted with a certain\namount of noise. We first put forward some generic properties of horizontal\nvisibility graphs which allow us to define a (graph theoretical) noise\nreduction filter. Accordingly, we evaluate its performance for the task of\ncalculating the period of noisy periodic signals, and compare our results with\nstandard time domain (autocorrelation) methods. Finally, potentials,\nlimitations and applications are discussed.\n", "  Based on our recent work on Quantum Nambu Mechanics $\\cite{af2}$, we provide\nan explicit quantization of the Lorenz chaotic attractor through the\nintroduction of Non-commutative phase space coordinates as Hermitian $ N \\times\nN $ matrices in $ R^{3}$. For the volume preserving part, they satisfy the\ncommutation relations induced by one of the two Nambu Hamiltonians, the second\none generating a unique time evolution. Dissipation is incorporated quantum\nmechanically in a self-consistent way having the correct classical limit\nwithout the introduction of external degrees of freedom. Due to its volume\nphase space contraction it violates the quantum commutation relations. We\ndemonstrate that the Heisenberg-Nambu evolution equations for the Matrix Lorenz\nsystem develop fast decoherence to N independent Lorenz attractors. On the\nother hand there is a weak dissipation regime, where the quantum mechanical\nproperties of the volume preserving non-dissipative sector survive for long\ntimes.\n", "  Effects of non-Gaussian $\\alpha-$stable L\\'evy noise on the Gompertz tumor\ngrowth model are quantified by considering the mean exit time and escape\nprobability of the cancer cell density from inside a safe or benign domain. The\nmean exit time and escape probability problems are formulated in a\ndifferential-integral equation with a fractional Laplacian operator. Numerical\nsimulations are conducted to evaluate how the mean exit time and escape\nprobability vary or bifurcates when $\\alpha$ changes. Some bifurcation\nphenomena are observed and their impacts are discussed.\n", "  This paper proposes a compressed sensing (CS) framework for the acquisition\nand reconstruction of frequency-sparse signals with chaotic dynamical systems.\nThe sparse signal is acting as an excitation term of a discrete-time chaotic\nsystem and the compressed measurement is obtained by downsampling the system\noutput. The reconstruction is realized through the estimation of the excitation\ncoefficients with principle of impulsive chaos synchronization. The -norm\nregularized nonlinear least squares is used to find the estimation. The\nproposed framework is easily implementable and creates secure measurements. The\nHenon map is used as an example to illustrate the principle and the\nperformance.\n", "  This paper presents a search for correlation in the arrival directions of\n2190 neutrino candidate events detected in 2007-2008 by the ANTARES telescope,\nand 69 ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) observed by the Pierre Auger\nObservatory between January 1st 2004 and December 31st 2009. No significant\ncorrelation was found. The corresponding 90% C.L. upper limit on the neutrino\nflux from each observed UHECR direction (assuming an equal flux from all of\nthem and for $E^{-2}$ energy spectrum) is 4.99$\\times10{^{-8}}$ GeV cm$^{-2}$\ns$^{-1}$.\n", "  We theoretically study the frequency stability of an opto-mechanical radio\nfrequency oscillator based on resonant interaction of two optical and one\nmechanical modes of the same optical microcavity. A generalized expression for\nthe phase noise of the oscillator is derived using Langevin formalism and\ncompared to the phase noise of existing electronic oscillators.\n", "  Based on the principle of chaotification for continuous-time autonomous\nsystems, which relies on two basic properties of chaos, i.e., globally bounded\nwith necessary positive-zero-negative Lyapunov exponents, this paper derives a\nfeasible and unified chaotification method of designing a general chaotic\ncontinuous-time autonomous nonlinear system. For a system consisting of a\nlinear and a nonlinear subsystem, chaotification is achieved using separation\nof state variables, which decomposes the system into two open-loop subsystems\ninteracting through mutual feedback resulting in an overall closed-loop\nnonlinear feedback system. Under the condition that the nonlinear feedback\ncontrol output is uniformly bounded where the nonlinear function is of\nbounded-input/bounded-output, it is proved that the resulting system is chaotic\nin the sense of being globally bounded with a required placement of Lyapunov\nexponents. Several numerical examples are given to verify the effectiveness of\nthe theoretical design. Since linear systems are special cases of nonlinear\nsystems, the new method is also applicable to linear systems in general.\n", "  A new computational technique based on the symbolic description utilizing\nkneading invariants is proposed and verified for explorations of dynamical and\nparametric chaos in a few exemplary systems with the Lorenz attractor. The\ntechnique allows for uncovering the stunning complexity and universality of\nbi-parametric structures and detect their organizing centers - codimension-two\nT-points and separating saddles in the kneading-based scans of the iconic\nLorenz equation from hydrodynamics, a normal model from mathematics, and a\nlaser model from nonlinear optics.\n", "  We present the results of a cross-correlation of the Planck Early Release\nCompact Source Catalog (ERCSC) with the catalog of Herschel-ATLAS sources\ndetected in the Phase 1 fields, covering 134.55 deg2. There are 28 ERCSC\nsources detected by Planck at 857 GHz in this area. As many as 16 of them are\nprobably high Galactic latitude cirrus; 10 additional sources can be clearly\nidentified as bright, low-z galaxies; one further source is resolved by\nHerschel as two relatively bright sources; and the last is resolved into an\nunusual condensation of low-flux, probably high-redshift point sources, around\na strongly lensed Herschel-ATLAS source at z = 3.26. Our results demonstrate\nthat the higher sensitivity and higher angular resolution H-ATLAS maps provide\nessential information for the interpretation of candidate sources extracted\nfrom Planck sub-mm maps.\n", "  The reader can find in the literature a lot of different techniques to study\nthe dynamics of a given system and also, many suitable numerical integrators to\ncompute them. Notwithstanding the recent work of Maffione et al. (2011a) for\nmappings, a detailed comparison among the widespread indicators of chaos in a\ngeneral system is still lacking. Such a comparison could lead to select the\nmost efficient algorithms given a certain dynamical problem. Furthermore, in\norder to choose the appropriate numerical integrators to compute them, more\ncomparative studies among numerical integrators are also needed.\n  This work deals with both problems. We first extend the work of Maffione et\nal. (2011) for mappings to the 2D H\\'enon & Heiles (1964) potential, and\ncompare several variational indicators of chaos: the Lyapunov Indicator (LI);\nthe Mean Exponential Growth Factor of Nearby Orbits (MEGNO); the Smaller\nAlignment Index (SALI) and its generalized version, the Generalized Alignment\nIndex (GALI); the Fast Lyapunov Indicator (FLI) and its variant, the Orthogonal\nFast Lyapunov Indicator (OFLI); the Spectral Distance (D) and the Dynamical\nSpectras of Stretching Numbers (SSNs). We also include in the record the\n  Relative Lyapunov Indicator (RLI), which is not a variational indicator as\nthe others. Then, we test a numerical technique to integrate\n  Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) based on the Taylor method implemented\nby Jorba & Zou (2005) (called taylor), and we compare its performance with\nother two well-known efficient integrators: the Prince & Dormand (1981)\nimplementation of a Runge-Kutta of order 7-8 (DOPRI8) and a Bulirsch-St\\\"oer\nimplementation. These tests are run under two very different systems from the\ncomplexity of their equations point of view: a triaxial galactic potential\nmodel and a perturbed 3D quartic oscillator.\n", "  We study tunneling in various shaped, closed, two-dimensional, flat\npotential, double wells by calculating the energy splitting between symmetric\nand anti-symmetric state pairs. For shapes that have regular or nearly regular\nclassical behavior (e.g. rectangular or circular) the tunneling rates vary\ngreatly over wide ranges often by several orders of magnitude. However, for\nwell shapes that admit more classically chaotic behavior (e.g. the stadium, the\nSinai billiard) the range of tunneling rates narrows, often by orders of\nmagnitude. This dramatic narrowing appears to come from destabilization of\nperiodic orbits in the regular wells that produce the largest and smallest\ntunneling rates and causes the splitting vs. energy relation to take on a\npossibly universal shape. It is in this sense that we say the quantum chaos\nregularizes the tunneling rates.\n", "  By means of the transfer matrix method, the optical properties of fibers with\na distinct intermediate layer between a hol-low core and periodic cladding are\ncalculated. The periodic cladding consists of two types of the alternating\nlayers. The intermediate layer has distinct thickness and refractive index.\nDepending on these parameters, the fiber can work in the single-mode or\nmulti-mode regimes. In the multi-mode regime, the optical loss of the smallest\nloss mode can be de-creased by increasing the thickness of the layer. In the\nsingle-mode regime, the optical loss falls with a rise in the refrac-tive index\nof the intermediate layer. The optical properties of the fiber are determined\nby the antiresonance reflection from the intermediate layer and the Bragg\nreflection from the periodic cladding. Selecting the parameters of the\ninterme-diate layer, the optical loss of the fiber in the single-mode regime\ncan be reduced by an order of magnitude over the loss of the traditional Bragg\nfiber.\n", "  We apply to bidimensional chaotic maps the numerical method proposed by\nGinelli et al. to approximate the associated Oseledets splitting, i.e. the set\nof linear subspaces spanned by the so called covariant Lyapunov vectors (CLV)\nand corresponding to the Lyapunov spectrum. These subspaces are the analog of\nlinearized invariant manifolds for non-periodic points, so the angles between\nthem can be used to quantify the degree of hyperbolicity of generic orbits;\nhowever, being such splitting non invariant under smooth transformations of\nphase space, it is interesting to investigate the properties of transversality\nwhen coordinates change, e.g. to study it in distinct dynamical systems. To\nillustrate this issue on the Chirikov-Taylor standard map we compare the\nprobability densities of transversality for two different coordinate systems;\nthese are connected by a linear transformation that deforms splitting angles\nthrough phase space, changing also the probability density of almost-zero\nangles although complete tangencies are in fact invariant. This is completely\ndue to the PDF transformation law and strongly suggests that any statistical\ninference from such distributions must be generally taken with care.\n", "  We demonstrate that interacting spasers arranged in a 2D array of arbitrary\nsize can be mutually synchronized allowing them to supperradiate. For arrays\nsmaller than the free space wavelength, the total radiated power is\nproportional to the square of the number N of spasers. For larger arrays, the\nradiation power is linear in N. However, the emitted beam becomes highly\ndirectional with intensity of radiation proportional to N^2 in the direction\nperpendicular to the plane of the array. Thus, spasers, which mainly amplify\nnear fields, become an efficient source of far field radiation when they are\narranged into an array.\n", "  We develop a new method for tagging jets produced by hadronically decaying\ntop quarks. The method is an application of shower deconstruction, a maximum\ninformation approach that was previously applied to identifying jets produced\nby Higgs bosons that decay to bottom quarks. We tag an observed jet as a top\njet based on a cut on a calculated variable that is an approximation to the\nratio of the likelihood that a top jet would have the structure of the observed\njet to the likelihood that a non-top QCD jet would have this structure. We find\nthat the shower deconstruction based tagger can perform better in\ndiscriminating boosted top quark jets from QCD jets than other publicly\navailable tagging algorithms.\n", "  We shall consider the problem of Dark Matter in torsion gravity with Dirac\nmatter fields; we will consider the fact that if WIMPs in a bath are allowed to\nform condensates then torsional effects may be relevant even at galactic\nscales: we show that torsionally-gravitating Dirac fields have interesting\nproperties for the problem of DM. We discuss consequences.\n", "  In this Letter, we investigate the group delay of optical pulses through\nmultilayer dielectric mirrors (MDM) combined with gravitational wave (GW). We\nfind that the delay increases linearly with MDM length for the transmitted wave\npacket, whereas the Hartman effect disappears. Our study provides insight into\nthe nature of both quantum tunnelling and GW.\n", "  The optical surface brightness of dark nebulae is mainly due to scattering of\nintegrated starlight by classical dust grains. It contains information on the\nimpinging interstellar radiation field, cloud structure, and grain scattering\nproperties. We have obtained spectra of the scattered light from 3500 to 9000\nAngstrom in two globules, the Thumbprint Nebula and DC303.8-14.2.\n  We use observations of the scattered light to study the impinging integrated\nstarlight spectrum as well as the scattered H-alpha and other line emissions\nfrom all over the sky. We search also for the presence of other than scattered\nlight in the two globules.\n  We obtained long-slit spectra encompassing the whole globule plus adjacent\nsky in a one-slit setting, thus enabling efficient elimination of airglow and\nother foreground sky components. We calculated synthetic integrated starlight\nspectra for the solar neighbourhood using HIPPARCOS-based stellar distributions\nand the spectral library of Pickles.\n  Spectra are presented separately for the bright rims and dark cores of the\nglobules. The continuum spectral energy distributions and absorption line\nspectra can be well modelled with the synthetic integrated starlight spectra.\nEmission lines of H-alpha + NII, H-beta, and SII are detected and are\ninterpreted in terms of scattered light plus an in situ warm ionized medium\ncomponent behind the globules. We detected an excess of emission over the\nwavelength range 5200-8000 Angstrom in DC303.8-14.2 but the nature of this\nemission remains open.\n", "  We present a method for the realization of radially and azimuthally polarized\nnonparaxial Bessel beams in a rigorous but simple manner. This result is\nachieved by using the concept of Hertz vector potential to generate exact\nvector solutions of Maxwell's equations from scalar Bessel beams. The scalar\npart of the Hertz potential is built by analogy with the paraxial case as a\nlinear combination of Bessel beams carrying a unit of orbital angular momentum.\nIn this way we are able to obtain spatial and polarization patterns analogous\nto the ones exhibited by the standard cylindrically polarized paraxial beams.\nApplications of these beams are discussed.\n", "  Two-photon interference with independent classical sources, in which\nsuperposition of two indistinguishable two-photon paths plays a key role, is of\nlimited visibility of interference fringes with a maximum value of 50%. By\nusing a random-phase grating to modulate the wavefront of a coherent light, we\nintroduce superposition of multiple indistinguishable two-photon paths, which\nenhances the two-photon interference effect with a signature of visibility\nexceeding 50%. The result shows the importance of phase control in the control\nof high-order coherence of classical light.\n", "  Extraordinary light rays propagating inside a hyperbolic metamaterial look\nsimilar to particle world lines in a 2+1 dimensional Minkowski spacetime [1].\nMagnetic nanoparticles in a ferrofluid are known to form nanocolumns aligned\nalong the magnetic field, so that a hyperbolic metamaterial may be formed at\nlarge enough nanoparticle concentration nH. Here we investigate optical\nproperties of such a metamaterial just below nH. While on average such a\nmetamaterial is elliptical, thermal fluctuations of nanoparticle concentration\nlead to transient formation of hyperbolic regions (3D Minkowski spacetimes)\ninside this metamaterial. Thus, thermal fluctuations in a ferrofluid look\nsimilar to creation and disappearance of individual Minkowski spacetimes\n(universes) in the cosmological multiverse. This theoretical picture is\nsupported by experimental measurements of polarization-dependent optical\ntransmission of a cobalt based ferrofluid at 1500 nm.\n", "  We explore the near-field radiative thermal energy transfer properties of\nhyperbolic metamaterials. The presence of unique electromagnetic states in a\nbroad bandwidth leads to super-planckian thermal energy transfer between\nmetamaterials separated by a nano-gap. We consider practical phonon-polaritonic\nmetamaterials for thermal engineering in the mid-infrared range and show that\nthe effect exists in spite of the losses, absorption and finite unit cell size.\nFor thermophotovoltaic energy conversion applications requiring energy transfer\nin the near-infrared range we introduce high temperature hyperbolic\nmetamaterials based on plasmonic materials with a high melting point. Our work\npaves the way for practical high temperature radiative thermal energy transfer\napplications of hyperbolic metamaterials.\n", "  We consider theoretically nonlinear effects in a semiconductor quantum well\nembedded inside a photonic microcavity. Two-photon absorption by a 2p exciton\nstate is considered and investigated; the matrix element of two-photon\nabsorption is calculated. We compute the emission spectrum of the sample and\ndemonstrate that under coherent pumping the nonlinearity of the two photon\nabsorption process gives rise to bistability.\n", "  The quasistatic field around a circular hole in a two-dimensional hyperbolic\nmedium is studied. As the loss parameter goes to zero, it is found that the\nelectric field diverges along four lines each tangent to the hole. In this\nlimit, the power dissipated by the field in the vicinity of these lines, per\nunit length of the line, goes to zero but extends further and further out so\nthat the net power dissipated remains finite. Additionally the interaction\nbetween polarizable dipoles in a hyperbolic medium is studied. It is shown that\na dipole with small polarizability can dramatically influence the dipole moment\nof a distant polarizable dipole, if it is appropriately placed. We call this\nthe searchlight effect, as the enhancement depends on the orientation of the\nline joining the polarizable dipoles and can be varied by changing the\nfrequency. For some particular polarizabilities the enhancement can actually\nincrease the further the polarizable dipoles are apart.\n", "  In contrast to designing nanophotonic devices by tuning a handful of device\nparameters, we have developed a computational method which utilizes the full\nparameter space to design linear nanophotonic devices. We show that our method\nmay indeed be capable of designing any linear nanophotonic device by\ndemonstrating designed structures which are fully three-dimensional and\nmulti-modal, exhibit novel functionality, have very compact footprints, exhibit\nhigh efficiency, and are manufacturable. In addition, we also demonstrate the\nability to produce structures which are strongly robust to wavelength and\ntemperature shift, as well as fabrication error. Critically, we show that our\nmethod does not require the user to be a nanophotonic expert or to perform any\nmanual tuning. Instead, we are able to design devices solely based on the users\ndesired performance specification for the device.\n", "  We show by numerical modeling that saturation of the population inversion\nreduces the stimulated thermal Rayleigh gain relative to the laser gain in\nlarge mode area fiber amplifiers. We show how to exploit this effect to raise\nmode instability thresholds by a substantial factor. We also demonstrate that\nwhen suppression of stimulated Brillouin scattering and the population\nsaturation effect are both taken into account, counter-pumped amplifiers have\nhigher mode instability thresholds than co-pumped amplifiers for fully\nYb$^{3+}$ doped cores, and confined doping can further raise the thresholds.\n", "  We introduce the idea of discontinuous electric and magnetic fields at a\nboundary to design and shape wavefronts in an arbitrary manner. To create this\ndiscontinuity in the field we use electric and magnetic currents which act like\na Huygens source to radiate the desired wavefront. These currents can be\nsynthesized either by an array of electric and magnetic dipoles or by a\ncombined impedance and admittance surface. A dipole array is an active\nimplementation to impose discontinuous fields while the impedance/admittance\nsurface acts as a passive one. We then expand on our previous work showing how\nelectric and magnetic dipole arrays can be used to cloak an object\ndemonstrating two novel cloaking schemes. We also show how to arbitrarily\nrefract a beam using a set of impedance and admittance surfaces. Refraction\nusing the idea of discontinuous fields is shown to be a more general case of\nrefraction using phase discontinuities.\n", "  We demonstrate feedback-optimized focusing of spatially coherent\npolychromatic light after transmission through strongly scattering media, and\ndescribe the relationship between optimized focus intensity and initial\nfar-field speckle contrast. Optimization is performed using a MEMS spatial\nlight modulator with camera-based or spectrometer-based feedback. We observe\nthat the spectral bandwidth of the optimized focus depends on characteristics\nof the feedback signal. We interpret this dependence as a modification in the\nnumber of spectral modes transmitted by the sample, and introduce a simple\nmodel for polychromatic focus enhancement that is corroborated by experiment\nwith calibrated samples.\n", "  We describe a simple and robust approach for characterizing the shift-variant\npupil aberrations of wide field-of-view microscopy systems. We derive the\nlocation-dependent pupil transfer functions by first capturing multiple\nintensity images at different defocus settings; a generalized pattern search\n(GPS) algorithm is then applied to recover the complex pupil functions at ~350\ndifferent spatial locations over the entire field-of-view. Parameter fitting\ntransforms these pupil functions into accurate 2D aberration maps. We\ndemonstrate shift-variant aberration compensation by using an\ninformation-preserving image deconvolution scheme over the entire\nfield-of-view. Such automated shift-variant pupil characterization will\nfacilitate new approaches of aberration correction for future gigapixel imaging\nplatforms.\n", "  We demonstrate upconversion single-photon detection for the 1550-nm band\nusing a PPLN waveguide, long-wavelength pump, and narrowband filtering using a\nvolume Bragg grating. We achieve total-system detection efficiency of around\n30% with noise at the dark-count level of a silicon APD. Based on the new\ndetector, a single-pixel up-conversion infrared spectrometer with a noise\nequivalent power of -142 dBm was demonstrated, which was better than liquid\nnitrogen cooled InGaAs arrary.\n", "  We demonstrate that trapping of dispersive waves between two optical solitons\ntakes place when resonant scattering of the waves on the solitons leads to\nnearly perfect reflections. The momentum transfer from the radiation to\nsolitons results in their mutual attraction and a subsequent collision. The\nspectrum of the trapped radiation can either expand or shrink in the course of\nthe propagation, which is controlled by arranging either collision or\nseparation of the solitons.\n", "  The superradiant Rayleigh scattering using a pump laser incident along the\nshort axis of a Bose-Einstein condensate with a density distortion is studied,\nwhere the distortion is formed by shocking the condensate utilizing the\nresidual magnetic force after the switching-off of the trapping potential. We\nfind that very small variation of the atomic density distribution would induce\nremarkable asymmetrically populated scattering modes by the matter-wave\nsuperradiance with long time pulse. The optical field in the diluter region of\nthe atomic cloud is more greatly amplified, which is not an ordinary mode\namplification with the previous cognition. Our numerical simulations with the\ndensity envelop distortion are consistent with the experimental results. This\nsupplies a useful method to reflect the geometric symmetries of the atomic\ndensity profile by the superradiance scattering.\n", "  We demonstrate that the fission of higher-order N-solitons with a subsequent\nejection of fundamental quasi-solitons creates solitonic cavities, formed by a\npair of solitons with dispersive light trapped between them. As a result of\nmultiple reflections of the trapped light from the bounding solitons which act\nas mirrors, they bend their trajectories and collide. In the spectral-domain,\nthe two solitons receive blue and red wavelength shifts, respectively. The\nspectrum of the bouncing trapped light alters as well. This phenomenon strongly\naffect spectral characteristics of the generated supercontinuum. Studies of the\nsystem's parameters, which are responsible for the creation of the cavities,\nreveal possibilities of predicting and controlling soliton-soliton collisions\ninduced by multiple reflections of the trapped light.\n", "  Diffusion of cosmic rays (CRs) is the key process of understanding their\npropagation and acceleration. We employ the description of spatial separation\nof magnetic field lines in MHD turbulence in Lazarian & Vishniac (1999) to\nquantify the divergence of magnetic field on scales less than the injection\nscale of turbulence and show this divergence induces superdiffusion of CR in\nthe direction perpendicular to the mean magnetic field. The perpendicular\ndisplacement squared increases, not as distance $x$ along magnetic field, which\nis the case for a regular diffusion, but as the $x^{3}$ for freely streaming\nCRs. The dependence changes to $x^{3/2}$ for the CRs propagating diffusively\nalong magnetic field. In the latter case we show that it is important to\ndistinguish the perpendicular displacement in respect to the mean field and to\nthe local magnetic field. We consider how superdiffusion changes the\nacceleration of CRs in shocks and show how it decreases efficiency of the CRs\nacceleration in perpendicular shocks. We also demonstrate that in the case when\nsmall-scale magnetic field is being generated in the pre-shock region, an\nefficient acceleration can take place for the CRs streaming without collisions\nalong magnetic loops.\n", "  We report on the lasing in air and pure nitrogen gas pumped by a single 800\nnm femtosecond laser pulse. Depending on gas pressure, incident laser power and\nbeam convergence, different lasing lines are observed in the forward direction\nwith rapid change of their relative intensities. The lines are attributed to\ntransitions between vibrational and rotational levels of the first negative\nband of the singly charged nitrogen molecule-ion. We show that self-seeding\nplays an important role in the observed intensity changes.\n", "  The velocity distribution function (VDF) of dark matter (DM) halos in\n$\\Lambda$CDM dissipationless cosmological simulations, which must be\nnon-separable in its radial and tangential components, is still poorly known.\nWe present the first single-parameter, non-separable, anisotropic model for the\nVDF in $\\Lambda$CDM halos, built from an isotropic $q$-Gaussian (Tsallis) VDF\nof the isotropic set of dimensionless spherical velocity components (after\nsubtraction of streaming motions), normalized by the respective velocity\ndispersions. We test our VDF on 90 cluster-mass halos of a dissipationless\ncosmological simulation.\n  Beyond the virial radius, $r_{\\rm vir}$, our model VDF adequately reproduces\nthat measured in the simulated halos, but no $q$-Gaussian model can adequately\nrepresent the VDF within $r_{\\rm vir}$, as the speed distribution function is\nthen flatter-topped than any $q$-Gaussian can allow. Nevertheless, our VDF fits\nsignificantly better the simulations than the commonly used Maxwellian\n(Gaussian) distribution, at virtually all radii within $5\\,r_{\\rm vir}$. Within\n0.4 (1) $r_{\\rm vir}$, the non-Gaussianity index $q$ is (roughly) linearly\nrelated to the slope of the density profile and also to the velocity anisotropy\nprofile. We provide a parametrization of the modulation of $q$ with radius for\nboth the median fits and the fit of the stacked halo. At radii of a few percent\nof $r_{\\rm vir}$, corresponding to the Solar position in the Milky Way, our\nbest-fit VDF, although fitting better the simulations than the Gaussian one,\noverproduces significantly the fraction of high velocity objects, indicating\nthat one should not blindly use these $q$-Gaussian fits to make predictions on\nthe direct detection rate of DM particles.\n", "  Polterovich proved a remarkable closed formula for heat kernel coefficients\nof the Laplace operator on compact Riemannian manifolds involving powers of\nLaplacians acting on the distance function. In the case of K\\\"ahler manifolds,\nwe prove a combinatorial formula for powers of the complex Laplacian and use it\nto derive an explicit graph theoretic formula for the numerics in heat\ncoefficients as a linear combination of metric jets based on Polterovich's\nformula.\n", "  A functionally graded Al-doped ZnO structure is presented which combines\nconductivity, visible transparency and light scattering with mechanical\nflexibility. The nano and meso-architecture, constituted by a hierarchical,\nlarge surface area, mesoporous tree-like structure evolving in a compact layer,\nis synthesized at room temperature and is fully compatible with plastic\nsubstrates. Light trapping capability is demonstrated by showing up to 100%\nimprovement of light absorption of a low bandgap polymer employed as the active\nlayer.\n", "  We explicitly apply localization results to study the interpolation between\nthree and two dimensional mirror symmetry for Abelian gauge theories with four\nsupercharges. We first use the ellipsoid S_b^3 partition functions to verify\nthe mirror symmetry between a pair of general three dimensional N=2 Abelian\nChern-Simons quiver gauge theories. These expressions readily factorize into\nholomorphic blocks and their anti-holomorphic copies, so we can also obtain the\npartition functions on S^1 x S^2 via fusion procedure. We then demonstrate S^1\nx S^2 partition functions for the three dimensional Abelian gauge theories can\nbe dimensionally reduced to the S^2 partition functions of N=(2,2) GLSM and\nLandau-Ginzburg model for the corresponding two dimensional mirror pair, as\nanticipated previously in \\cite{Aganagic:2001uw}. We also comment on the\nanalogous interpolation for the non-Abelian gauge theories and compute the\nK-theory vortex partition function for a simple limit to verify the prediction\nfrom holomorphic block.\n", "  Gamma-ray is a good probe of dark matter (DM) particles in the Universe. We\nsearch for the DM annihilation signals in the direction of the Andromeda galaxy\n(M31) using 7.5 year Fermi-LAT pass 8 data. Similar to Pshirkov et al. (2016),\nwe find that there is residual excess emission from the direction of M31 if\nonly the galactic disk as traced by the far infrared emission is considered.\nAdding a point-like source will improve the fitting effectively, although\nadditional slight improvements can be found if an extended component such as a\nuniform disk or two bubbles is added instead. Taking the far infrared disk plus\na point source as the background model, we search for the DM annihilation\nsignals in the data. We find that there is strong degeneracy between the\nemission from the galaxy and that from 10s GeV mass DM annihilation in the main\nhalo with quark final state. However, the required DM annihilation cross\nsection is about $10^{-25}-10^{-24}$ cm$^3$s$^{-1}$, orders of magnitude larger\nthan the constraints from observations of dwarf spheroidal galaxies, indicating\na non-DM origin of the emission. If DM subhalos are taken into account, the\ndegeneracy is broken. When considering the enhancement from DM subhalos, the\nconstraints on DM model parameters are comparable to (or slightly weaker than)\nthose from the population of dwarf spheroidal galaxies. We also discuss the\ninverse Compton scattering component from DM annihilation induced\nelectrons/positrons. For the first time we include an energy dependent template\nof the inverse Compton emission (i.e., a template cube) in the data analysis to\ntake into account the effect of diffusion of charged particles. We find a\nsignificant improvement of the constraints in the high mass range of DM\nparticles after considering the inverse Compton emission.\n", "  Series expansions in the chemical potential mu are studied for an effective\ntheory of QCD which has a flux representation where the complex action is\novercome. In particular we consider fugacity series, Taylor expansion and a\nmodified Taylor expansion and compare the outcome of these series to the\nreference results from a Monte Carlo simulation in the flux representation\nwhere arbitrary mu is accessible. It is shown that for most parameter values\nthe fugacity expansion gives the best approximation to the data from the flux\nsimulation, followed by our newly proposed modified Taylor expansion. For the\nconventional Taylor expansion we find that the results coincide with the flux\ndata only for very small mu.\n", "  This has been written as a chapter for \"Engineering Chemical Complexity II\",\nand as such does not have an abstract.\n", "  In this paper, we analyze the modification of integrable models in the\n$\\kappa$-deformed space-time. We show that two dimensional isotropic oscillator\nproblem, Kepler problem and MICZ-Kepler problem in $\\kappa$-deformed space-time\nadmit integrals of motion as in the commutative space. We also show that the\nduality equivalence between $\\kappa$-deformed Kepler problem and\n$\\kappa$-deformed two-dimensional isotropic oscillator explicitly, by deriving\nBohlin-Sundman transformation which maps these two systems. These results are\nvalid to all orders the the deformation parameter.\n", "  The photoelectrodissolution of n-type silicon constitutes a convenient model\nsystem to study the nonlinear dynamics of oscillatory media. On the silicon\nsurface, a silicon oxide layer forms. In the lateral direction, the thickness\nof this layer is not uniform. Rather, several spatio-temporal patterns in the\noxide layer emerge spontaneously, ranging from cluster patterns and turbulence\nto quite peculiar dynamics like chimera states. Introducing a nonlinear global\ncoupling in the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation allows us to identify this\nnonlinear coupling as the essential ingredient to describe the patterns found\nin the experiments. The nonlinear global coupling is designed in such a way, as\nto capture an important, experimentally observed feature: the spatially\naveraged oxide-layer thickness shows nearly harmonic oscillations. Simulations\nof the modified complex Ginzburg-Landau equation capture the experimental\ndynamics very well.\n", "  In this paper, jump relations for one dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)\nshock waves propagating in a dusty gas environment are expressed in a simple\nform in terms of dimensionless variables. The dusty gas is assumed to be a\nmixture of a perfect gas and spherically small solid particles, in which solid\nparticles are continuously distributed. The jump relations across the MHD shock\nfront for the pressure, the density and the velocity of mixture have been\nderived, respectively in terms of a compression ratio across the shock front in\na gas-solid particle two-phase flow. The expressions for the speed of sound,\nadiabatic compressibility of mixture and the change-in-entropy across the MHD\nshock front have also been derived in terms of the compression ratio. Further,\nthe handy forms of MHD shock jump relations have been obtained in terms of the\ninitial volume fraction of small solid particles and the ratio of specific\nheats of the mixture, simultaneously for the two cases viz., (i) when the shock\nis strong and, (ii) when it is weak. Finally, the cases of strong and weak\nshocks are explored under two distinct conditions viz., (i) when the applied\nmagnetic field is strong and, (ii) when the field is weak. The simplified MHD\nshock jump relations for dusty gas reduce to MHD shock jump relations for an\nidea gas when the mass fraction of solid particles in the mixture becomes zero.\nThe effects due to the magnetic field, the mass fraction of solid particles in\nmixture, and the ratio of the density of solid particles to the initial density\nof gas are studied on the pressure, density, velocity of mixture, speed of\nsound, adiabatic compressibility of mixture and the change-in-entropy across\nthe shock front. The results provided a clear picture of whether and how the\npresence of magnetic field and dusty parameters affect the flow field behind\nthe MHD shock front.\n", "  We use the RTT realization of the quantum affine superalgebra associated with\nthe Lie superalgebra $\\mathfrak{gl}(M,N)$ to study its finite-dimensional\nrepresentations and their tensor products. In the case $\\mathfrak{gl}(1,1)$,\nthe cyclicity condition of tensor products of finite-dimensional simple modules\nis determined completely in terms of zeros and poles of rational functions.\nThis in turn induces cyclicity of some particular tensor products of\nKirillov-Reshetikhin modules related to $\\mathfrak{gl}(M,N)$.\n", "  Starting from the equations of motion of the fields involved in a theory with\nspontaneous symmetry breaking and by making simple assumptions regarding their\nbehavior we derive simple tree level relations between the mass of the Higgs\nboson in the theory and the masses of the gauge bosons corresponding to the\nbroken generators. We show that these mass relations have a clear meaning if\nboth the scalars and the gauge bosons are composite states made of two\nfermions.\n", "  The conservation law for the angular momentum in curved spacetime requires\nthat the antisymmetric part of the affine connection (the torsion tensor) is a\nvariable in the principle of least action. The coupling between spin and\ntorsion generates gravitational repulsion in fermionic matter at extremely high\ndensities and avoids the formation of singularities in black holes. We show\nthat every black hole in the presence of torsion forms a nonsingular, closed,\nnearly flat, homogeneous, and isotropic universe on the other side of its event\nhorizon. Quantum particle production in such a universe can generate a period\nof exponential expansion which creates an enormous amount of matter in that\nuniverse. Accordingly, our Universe may have originated from the interior of a\nblack hole existing in another universe.\n", "  The cosmological observation indicates that the effective equation of state\nparameter $w_{eff}$ varies with $z$: It changes from $w_{eff}>-1$ to\n$w_{eff}<-1$ at $z\\sim 0.2$. We investigate under which condition it exhibits\nsuch behaviors based on the five-dimensional braneworld scenario. It is\npossible in the model with or without an energy exchange between the four\ndimensional universe and the fifth dimension. However the curves of $w_{eff}$\nare quite different between the two cases.\n", "  In this paper we argue that a firewall is simply a manifestation of an\ninconsistent truncation of non-perturbative effects that unitarize the\nsemiclassical black hole. Namely, we show that a naive truncation of quantum\ncorrections to the Hawking spectrum at order ${\\cal O}(e^{-S})$, inexorably\nleads to a \"localised'' divergent energy density near the black hole horizon.\nNevertheless, in the same approximation, a distant observer only sees a\ndiscretised spectrum and concludes that unitarity is achieved by ${\\cal\nO}(e^{-S})$ effects. This is due to the fact that instead, the correct quantum\ncorrections to the Hawking spectrum go like ${\\cal O}( g^{tt} e^{-S})$.\nTherefore, while at a distance far away from the horizon, where $g^{tt}\\approx\n1$, quantum corrections {\\it are} perturbative, they {\\it do} diverge close to\nthe horizon, where $g^{tt}\\rightarrow \\infty$. Nevertheless, these\n\"corrections\" nicely re-sum so that correlations functions are smooth at the\nwould-be black hole horizon. Thus, we conclude that the appearance of firewalls\nis just a signal of the breaking of the semiclassical approximation at the Page\ntime, even for large black holes.\n", "  We studied full revivals of quantum states in the Jaynes-Cannings model. It\nis proved that in the case of zero detuning in subspaces generated by two\nadjacent pairs of energy levels, full revival of the subspace does not exist\nfor any values of the parameters. In the case of non-zero detuning on the\ncontrary, the set of parameters that allows full revival of such subspaces is\ndense as the subset of all parameters. The nature of these revivals differs\nfrom Rabi oscillations in subspaces of a single pair of energy. In more complex\nsubspaces the presence of full revival is reduced to particular cases of 10-th\nHilbert problem for rational solutions of systems of nonlinear algebraic\nequations, which has no algorithmic solution in general case.\n", "  A new experiment is described to detect a permanent electric dipole moment of\nthe proton with a sensitivity of $10^{-29}e\\cdot$cm by using polarized \"magic\"\nmomentum $0.7$~GeV/c protons in an all-electric storage ring. Systematic errors\nrelevant to the experiment are discussed and techniques to address them are\npresented. The measurement is sensitive to new physics beyond the Standard\nModel at the scale of 3000~TeV.\n", "  We analyze the efficacy of multiqubit W-type states as resources for quantum\ninformation. For this, we identify and generalize four-qubit W-type states. Our\nresults show that the states can be used as resources for deterministic quantum\ninformation processing. The utility of results, however, is limited by the\navailability of experimental setups to perform and distinguish multiqubit\nmeasurements. We, therefore, emphasize on another protocol where two users want\nto establish an optimal bipartite entanglement using the partially entangled\nW-type states. We found that for such practical purposes, four-qubit W states\ncan be a better resource in comparison to three-qubit W-type states. For dense\ncoding protocol, our states can be used deterministically to send two bits of\nclassical message by locally manipulating a single qubit.\n", "  Dualities are often supposed to be foundational, but they may come into\nconflict with background independence, because a hidden fixed structures is\nneeded to define the duality transformation. This conflict can be eliminated by\nextending a duality to a triality. This renders that fixed structure dynamical,\nwhile unifying it with the dual variables.\n  To illustrate this, we study matrix models with a cubic action, and show how\nbreaking its natural triality symmetry by imposing different compactifications\nyields particle mechanics, string theory and Chern-Simons theory. These result\nfrom compactifying, respectively, one, two and three dimensions. This may\nexplain the origin of Born's duality between position and momenta operators in\nquantum theory, as well as some of the the dualities of string theory.\n", "  This paper presents a study of the two-stream instability of an electron beam\npropagating in a finite-size plasma placed between two electrodes. It is shown\nthat the growth rate in such a system is much smaller than that of an infinite\nplasma or a finite size plasma with periodic boundary conditions. Even if the\nwidth of the plasma matches the resonance condition for a standing wave, a\nspatially growing wave is excited instead with the growth rate small compared\nto that of the standing wave in a periodic system. The approximate expression\nfor this growth rate is $\\gamma \\approx\n(1/13)\\omega_{pe}(n_{b}/n_{p})(L\\omega_{pe}/v_{b})\\ln (L\\omega_{pe}/v_{b})[\n1-0.18\\cos ( L\\omega_{pe}/v_{b}+{\\pi }/{2}) ]$, where $\\omega_{pe}$ is the\nelectron plasma frequency, $n_{b}$ and $n_{p}$ are the beam and the plasma\ndensities, respectively, $v_{b}$ is the beam velocity, and $L$ is the plasma\nwidth. The frequency, wave number and the spatial and temporal growth rates as\nfunctions of the plasma size exhibit band structure. The amplitude of\nsaturation of the instability depends on the system length, not on the beam\ncurrent. For short systems, the amplitude may exceed values predicted for\ninfinite plasmas by more than an order of magnitude.\n", "  The study of stable minimal surfaces in Riemannian $3$-manifolds $(M, g)$\nwith non-negative scalar curvature has a rich history. In this paper, we prove\nrigidity of such surfaces when $(M, g)$ is asymptotically flat and has horizon\nboundary. As a consequence, we obtain an effective version of the positive mass\ntheorem in terms of isoperimetric or, more generally, closed volume-preserving\nstable CMC surfaces that is appealing from both a physical and a purely\ngeometric point of view. We also include a proof of the following conjecture of\nR. Schoen: An asymptotically flat Riemannian $3$-manifold with non-negative\nscalar curvature that contains an unbounded area-minimizing surface is\nisometric to flat $\\mathbb{R}^3$.\n", "  In the present paper we evaluate the anomaly for the abelian axial current in\na non abelian chiral gauge theory, by using dimensional regularization. This\namount to formulate a procedure for managing traces with more than one\n$\\gamma_5$. \\par The suggested procedure obeys Lorentz covariance and\ncyclicity, at variance with previous approaches (e.g. the celebrated 't Hooft\nand Veltman's where Lorentz is violated) \\par The result of the present paper\nis a further step forward in the program initiated by a previous work on the\ntraces involving a single $\\gamma_5$. The final goal is an unconstrained\ndefinition of $\\gamma_5$ in dimensional regularization. Here, in the evaluation\nof the anomaly, we profit of the axial current conservation equation, when\nradiative corrections are neglected. This kind of tool is not always exploited\nin field theories with $\\gamma_5$, e.g. in the use of dimensional\nregularization of infrared and collinear divergences.\n", "  We will prove that for piecewise smooth and concave domains Korn's first\ninequality holds for vector fields satisfying homogeneous normal or tangential\nboundary conditions with explicit Korn constant square root of 2.\n", "  An inspection of the precise geometric constructions underlying fundamental\nnotions in quantum gauge field theories sheds light on various aspects which\ntend to be obscured in the usual formalisms. Revising the notions of mutually\nconjugated \"internal\" bundles we propose a general rule for the constructions\nof free quantum fields and their conjugates, naturally yielding the needed\nfundamental properties with regard to contractions, super-commutators, field\nmomentum and Hamiltonian, and other quantities. This scheme applies to fields\nof all types; in particular we examine consequences in relation to ghosts and\nanti-ghosts. Finally in the context of observer-independent Fr\\\"olicher-smooth\nquantum bundles we show how the antifield sectors naturally arise, and examine\nthe precise relation among these and the BRST symmetry of a gauge field theory.\n", "  We expand upon a claim made in a recent paper [arXiv:1411.5721] that generic\nminimally supersymmetric AdS backgrounds of warped flux compactifications of\nType II and M theory can be understood as satisfying a straightforward weak\nintegrability condition in the language of $E_{d(d)}\\times\\mathbb{R}^+$\ngeneralised geometry. Namely, they are spaces admitting a generalised\n$G$-structure set by the Killing spinor and with constant singlet generalised\nintrinsic torsion.\n", "  A covariant hamiltonian formalism for the dynamics of compact spinning bodies\nin curved space-time in the test-particle limit is described. The construction\nallows a large class of hamiltonians accounting for specific properties and\ninteractions of spinning bodies. The dynamics for a minimal and a specific\nnon-minimal hamiltonian is discussed. An independent derivation of the\nequations of motion from an appropriate energy-momentum tensor is provided. It\nis shown how to derive constants of motion, both background-independent and\nbackground-dependent ones.\n", "  Axion fields were originally introduced to control CP violation due to the\ntheta term in QCD. Pauli-Villars regularization, or the use of a parity\nsymmetric fermion measure, however, preserves CP in the fermion sector. A CP\nviolation arising from the theta term can then be neutralized in a natural way\nby setting theta equal to zero.\n", "  We compute the next-to-leading order term in the long-distance expansion of\nthe mutual information for free scalars in three space-time dimensions. The\ngeometry considered is two disjoint disks separated by a distance $r$ between\ntheir centers. No evidence for non-analyticity in the R\\'enyi parameter $n$ for\nthe continuation $n \\rightarrow 1$ in the next-to-leading order term is found.\n", "  Organometal halide perovskites are promising solar-cell materials for\nnext-generation photovoltaic applications. The long carrier lifetime and\ndiffusion length of these materials make them very attractive for use in light\nabsorbers and carrier transporters. While these aspects of organometal halide\nperovskites have attracted the most attention, the consequences of the Rashba\neffect, driven by strong spin-orbit coupling, on the photovoltaic properties of\nthese materials are largely unexplored. In this work, taking the electronic\nstructure of methylammonium lead iodide as an example, we propose an intrinsic\nmechanism for enhanced carrier lifetime in 3D Rashba materials. Based on\nfirst-principles calculations and a Rashba spin-orbit model, we demonstrate\nthat the recombination rate is reduced due to the spin-forbidden transition.\nThese results are important for understanding the fundamental physics of\norganometal halide perovskites and for optimizing and designing the materials\nwith better performance. The proposed mechanism including spin degrees of\nfreedom offers a new paradigm of using 3D Rashba materials for photovoltaic\napplications.\n", "  Semigroup algebras admit certain `coherent' deformations which, in the\nspecial case of a path algebra, may associate a periodic function to an\nevolving path; for a particle moving freely on a straight line after an initial\nimpulse, the wave length is that hypothesized by de Broglie's wave-particle\nduality. This theory leads to a model of \"physical\" phase space of which\nmathematical phase space, the cotangent bundle of configuration space, is a\nprojection. This space is singular, quantized at the Planck level, its\nstructure implies the existence of spin, and the spread of a packet can be\ndescribed as a random walk. The wavelength associated to a particle moving in\nthis space need not be constant and its phase can change discontinuously.\n", "  We discuss quadratic gravity where terms quadratic in the curvature tensor\nare included in the action. After reviewing the corresponding field equations,\nwe analyze in detail the physical propagating modes in some specific\nbackgrounds. First we confirm that the pure $R^2$ theory is indeed ghost free.\nThen we point out that for flat backgrounds the pure $R^2$ theory propagates\nonly a scalar massless mode and no spin-two tensor mode. However, the latter\nemerges either by expanding the theory around curved backgrounds like de Sitter\nor anti-de Sitter, or by changing the long-distance dynamics by introducing the\nstandard Einstein term. In both cases, the theory is modified in the infrared\nand a propagating graviton is recovered. Hence we recognize a subtle interplay\nbetween the UV and IR properties of higher order gravity. We also calculate the\ncorresponding Newton's law for general quadratic curvature theories. Finally,\nwe discuss how quadratic actions may be obtained from a fundamental theory like\nstring- or M-theory. We demonstrate that string theory on non-compact $CY_3$\nmanifolds, like a line bundle over $\\mathbb{CP}^2$, may indeed lead to gravity\ndynamics determined by a higher curvature action.\n", "  Operating high-intensity discharge lamps in the high frequency range (20-300\nkHz) provides energy-saving and cost reduction potentials. However,\ncommercially available lamp drivers do not make use of this operating strategy\nbecause light intensity fluctuations and even lamp destruction are possible.\nThe reason for the fluctuating discharge arc are acoustic resonances in this\nfrequency range that are excited in the arc tube. The acoustic resonances in\nturn generate a fluid flow that is caused by the acoustic streaming effect.\nHere, we present a 3D multiphysics model to determine the influence of acoustic\nstreaming on the temperature field in the vicinity of an acoustic\neigenfrequency. In that case a transition from stable to instable behavior\noccurs. The model is able to predict when light flicker can be expected. The\nresults are in very good accordance with accompanying experiments.\n", "  We study the so-called Descent, or Q-bar, Equation for the null polygonal\nsupersymmetric Wilson loop in the framework of the pentagon operator product\nexpansion. To properly address this problem, one requires to restore the\ncyclicity of the loop broken by the choice of OPE channels. In the course of\nthe study, we unravel a phenomenon of twist enhancement when passing to a\ncyclically shifted channel. Currently, we focus on the consistency of the\nall-order Descent equation for the particular case relating the NMHV heptagon\nto MHV hexagon. We find that the equation establishes a relation between\ncontributions of different twists and successfully verify it in perturbation\ntheory making use of available bootstrap predictions for elementary pentagons.\n", "  We present a comprehensive review of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies\nperformed on three nanoscale molecular magnets with different configurations of\ngeometrically frustrated antiferromagnetic (AFM) triangles, new spin\nfrustration systems with different novel structures: (1) the isolated single\nAFM triangle K$_6$[V$_{15}$As$_6$O$_{42}$(H$_2$O)]$\\cdot$8H$_2$O (in short\nV15), (2) the spin ball [Mo$_{72}$Fe$_{30}$O$_{252}$(Mo$_2$O$_7$(H$_2$O))$_2$\n(Mo$_2$O$_8$H$_2$(H$_2$O))(CH$_3$COO)$_{12}$(H$_2$O)$_{91}$]$\\cdot$150H$_2$O\n(in short Fe30 spin ball), and (3) the twisted triangular spin tube\n[(CuCl$_2$tachH)$_3$Cl]Cl$_2$ (in short Cu3 spin tube).\n", "  We study the asymptotic laws for the spatial distribution and the number of\nconnected components of zero sets of smooth Gaussian random functions of\nseveral real variables. The primary examples are various Gaussian ensembles of\nreal-valued polynomials (algebraic or trigonometric) of large degree on the\nsphere or torus, and translation-invariant smooth Gaussian functions on the\nEuclidean space restricted to large domains.\n", "  The concept of transparent and opaque horizons is defined. One example of\nopaqueness is the presence of a firewall. Two apparently contradictory\nstatements are reconciled: The overwhelming number of black hole states have\nopaque horizons; and: All black holes formed by natural processes have\ntransparent horizons. A diagnostic is proposed for transparency, namely that\nthe computational complexity of the state be increasing with time. It is shown\nthat opaque horizons are extremely unstable and that the slightest perturbation\nwill make them transparent within a scrambling time.\n", "  In the present paper we investigate the Tonks-Girardeau gas confined in a\nharmonic trap at finite temperature with thermal Bose-Fermi mapping method. The\npair distribution, density distribution, reduced one-body density matrix, the\noccupations number of natural orbitals, and momentum distribution are\nevaluated. In the whole temperature regime the pair distribution and density\ndistribution exhibit the same properties as those of polarized free Fermions\nbecause both of them depend on the modulus of wavefunction rather than\nwavefunction. While the reduced one-body density matrix, the natural orbital\noccupation, momentum distribution, which depend on wavefunction, of Tonks gas\ndisplays Bose properties different from polarized free Fermions at low\ntemperature. At high temperature we can not distinguish Tonks gas from the\npolarized free Fermi gas by all properties qualitatively.\n", "  The use of network theory to model disease propagation on populations\nintroduces important elements of reality to the classical epidemiological\nmodels. The use of random geometric graphs (RGG) is one of such network models\nthat allows for the consideration of spatial properties on disease propagation.\nIn certain real-world scenarios -like in the analysis of a disease propagating\nthrough plants- the shape of the plots and fields where the host of the disease\nis located may play a fundamental role on the propagation dynamics. Here we\nconsider a generalization of the RGG to account for the variation of the shape\nof the plots/fields where the hosts of a disease are allocated. We consider a\ndisease propagation taking place on the nodes of a random rectangular graph\n(RRG) and we consider a lower bound for the epidemic threshold of a\nSusceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) or Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR)\nmodel on these networks. Using extensive numerical simulations and based on our\nanalytical results we conclude that (ceteris paribus) the elongation of the\nplot/field in which the nodes are distributed makes the network more resilient\nto the propagation of a disease due to the fact that the epidemic threshold\nincreases with the elongation of the rectangle. These results agree with\naccumulated empirical evidence and simulation results about the propagation of\ndiseases on plants in plots/fields of the same area and different shapes.\n", "  Fayans energy density functional (EDF) FaNDF^0 has been applied to the nuclei\naround uranium region. Ground state characteristics of the Th, U and Pu\nisotopic chains, up to the two-neutron drip line, are found and compared with\npredictions from several Skyrme EDFs. The two-neutron drip line is found for\nFaNDF^0, SLy4 and SkM^* EDFs for a set of elements with even proton number,\nfrom Pb up to Fm.\n", "  Phase-sensitive measurements of the superconducting gap in Fe-based\nsuperconductors have proven more difficult than originally anticipated. While\nquasiparticle interference (QPI) measurements based on scanning tunneling\nspectroscopy are often proposed as defnitive tests of gap structure, the\nanalysis typically relies on details of the model employed. Here we point out\nthat the temperature dependence of momentum-integrated QPI data can be used to\nidentify gap sign changes in a qualitative way, and present an illustration for\n$s_{\\pm}$ and $s_{++}$ states in a system with typical Fe-pnictide Fermi\nsurface.\n", "  We discuss the possibility of devising cosmological observables which violate\nBell's inequalities. Such observables could be used to argue that cosmic scale\nfeatures were produced by quantum mechanical effects in the very early\nuniverse. As a proof of principle, we propose a somewhat elaborate inflationary\nmodel where a Bell inequality violating observable can be constructed.\n", "  One of the most sought-after objects in topological quantum matter systems is\na vortex carrying half a quantum of circulation. They were originally predicted\nto exist in superfluid 3He-A, but have never been resolved there. Here we\nreport an observation of half-quantum vortices (HQVs) in the polar phase of\nsuperfluid 3He. The vortices are created with rotation or by the Kibble-Zurek\nmechanism and identified based on their nuclear magnetic resonance signature.\nThis discovery provides a pathway for studies of unpaired Majorana modes bound\nto the HQV cores in the polar-distorted A phase.\n", "  Two-dimensional spatially localized structures in the complex Ginzburg-Landau\nequation with 1:1 resonance are studied near the simultaneous occurrence of a\nsteady front between two spatially homogeneous equilibria and a supercritical\nTuring bifurcation on one of them. The bifurcation structures of steady\ncircular fronts and localized target patterns are computed in the Turing-stable\nand Turing-unstable regimes. In particular, localized target patterns grow\nalong the solution branch via ring insertion at the core in a process\nreminiscent of defect-mediated snaking in one spatial dimension. Axisymmetric\noscillons on these solution branches are found to be stable over a wide\nparameter interval, and subject to various types of instability otherwise.\nDirect numerical simulations reveal novel depinning dynamics of localized\ntarget patterns in the radial direction, and of circular and planar localized\nhexagonal patterns in the fully two-dimensional system.\n", "  We analyze the one-dimensional periodic Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation in the\nlanguage of paracontrolled distributions, giving an alternative viewpoint on\nthe seminal results of Hairer.\n  Apart from deriving a basic existence and uniqueness result for\nparacontrolled solutions to the KPZ equation we perform a thorough study of\nsome related problems. We rigorously prove the links between KPZ equation,\nstochastic Burgers equation, and (linear) stochastic heat equation and also the\nexistence of solutions starting from quite irregular initial conditions. We\nalso build a partial link between energy solutions as introduced by Goncalves\nand Jara and paracontrolled solutions.\n  Interpreting the KPZ equation as the value function of an optimal control\nproblem, we give a pathwise proof for the global existence of solutions and\nthus for the strict positivity of solutions to the stochastic heat equation.\n  Moreover, we study Sasamoto-Spohn type discretizations of the stochastic\nBurgers equation and show that their limit solves the continuous Burgers\nequation possibly with an additional linear transport term. As an application,\nwe give a proof of the invariance of the white noise for the stochastic Burgers\nequation which does not rely on the Cole-Hopf transform.\n", "  We consider the 3-body problem of celestial mechanics in Euclidean, elliptic,\nand hyperbolic spaces, and study how the Lagrangian (equilateral) relative\nequilibria bifurcate when the Gaussian curvature varies. We thus prove the\nexistence of new classes of orbits. In particular, we find some families of\nisosceles triangles, which occur in elliptic space.\n", "  Magnonics is an emerging field with potential applications in classical and\nquantum information processing. Freely propagating magnons in two-dimensional\nmedia suffer from dispersion, which limits their effective range and fidelity.\nWe show the design of controllable magnonic circuitry, that utilise surface\ncurrent carrying wires to create magnonic waveguides. We also show the design\nof a magnonic directional coupler and controllable Michelson interferometer to\ndemonstrate its utility for information processing tasks.\n", "  We obtain a large class of new 4d Argyres-Douglas theories by classifying\nirregular punctures for the 6d (2,0) superconformal theory of ADE type on a\nsphere. Along the way, we identify the connection between the Hitchin system\nand three-fold singularity descriptions of the same Argyres-Douglas theory.\nOther constructions such as taking degeneration limits of the irregular\npuncture, adding an extra regular puncture, and introducing outer-automorphism\ntwists are also discussed. Later we investigate various features of these\ntheories including their Coulomb branch spectrum and central charges.\n", "  This paper aims to develop a rigorous asymptotic analysis of an approximate\nrenormalization group recursion for inverse participation ratios $P_q$ of\ncritical powerlaw random band matrices. The recursion goes back to the work by\nMirlin and Evers [37] and earlier works by Levitov [32, 33] and is aimed to\ndescribe the ensuing multifractality of the eigenvectors of such matrices. We\npoint out both similarities and dissimilarities of LME recursion to those\nappearing in the theory of multiplicative cascades and branching random walks\nand show that the methods developed in those fields can be adapted to the\npresent case. In particular the LME recursion is shown to exhibit a phase\ntransition, which we expect is a freezing transition, where the role of\ntemperature is played by the exponent $q$. However, the LME recursion has\nfeatures that make its rigorous analysis considerably harder and we point out\nseveral open problems for further study\n", "  We find an explicit closed formula for the $k$'th iterated commutator\n$\\mathrm{ad}_A^k(H_V(\\xi))$ of arbitrary order $k\\ge1$ between a Hamiltonian\n$H_V(\\xi)=M_{\\omega_\\xi}+S_{\\check V}$ and a conjugate operator\n$A=\\frac{\\mathfrak{i}}{2}(v_\\xi\\cdot\\nabla+\\nabla\\cdot v_\\xi)$, where\n$M_{\\omega_\\xi}$ is the operator of multiplication with the real analytic\nfunction $\\omega_\\xi$ which depends real analytically on the parameter $\\xi$,\nand the operator $S_{\\check V}$ is the operator of convolution with the\n(sufficiently nice) function $\\check V$, and $v_\\xi$ is some vector field\ndetermined by $\\omega_\\xi$. Under certain assumptions, which are satisfied for\nthe Yukawa potential, we then prove estimates of the form\n$\\lVert\\mathrm{ad}_A^k(H_V(\\xi))(H_0(\\xi)+\\mathfrak{i})^{-1}\\rVert\\le\nC_\\xi^kk!$ where $C_\\xi$ is some constant which depends continuously on $\\xi$.\nThe Hamiltonian is the fixed total momentum fiber Hamiltonian of an abstract\ntwo-body dispersive system and the work is inspired by a recent result\n[Engelmann-M{\\o}ller-Rasmussen, 2015] which, under conditions including\nestimates of the mentioned type, opens up for spectral deformation and analytic\nperturbation theory of embedded eigenvalues of finite multiplicity.\n", "  We investigated the growth of titanium oxide two-dimensional (2D)\nnanostructures on Au(111), produced by Ti evaporation and post-deposition\noxidation. Scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM and STS) and\nlow-energy electron diffraction (LEED) measurements characterized the\nmorphological, structural and electronic properties of the observed structures.\nFive distinct TiO\\sub{x} phases were identified: the \\emph{honeycomb} and\n\\emph{pinwheel} phases appear as monolayer films wetting the gold surface,\nwhile nanocrystallites of the \\emph{triangular}, \\emph{row} and \\emph{needle}\nphases grow mainly over the honeycomb or pinwheel layers. Density Functional\nTheory (DFT) investigation of the honeycomb structure supports a $(2\\times 2)$\nstructural model based on a Ti-O bilayer having $\\text{Ti}_2\\text{O}_3$\nstoichiometry. The pinwheel phase was observed to evolve, for increasing\ncoverage, from single triangular crystallites to a well-ordered film forming a\n$(4\\sqrt{7}\\times 4\\sqrt{7})R19.1^\\circ$ superstructure, which can be\ninterpreted within a moir\\~A\\c{opyright}-like model. Structural characteristics\nof the other three phases were disclosed from the analysis of high-resolution\nSTM measurements. STS measurements revealed a partial metallization of\nhoneycomb and pinwheel and a semiconducting character of row and triangular\nphases.\n", "  Employing virtual crystal approximation and super-cell methods for doping, we\nhave performed a comparative study of the electronic structures of various\ndoped BaFe$_2$As$_2$ materials by first principles simulations. Both of these\nmethods give rise to a similar density of states and band structures in case of\nhole doping (K doping in Ba site) and iso-electronic P doping in As site. But\nin case of electron doped systems with higher doping concentration, electronic\nstructures, calculated using virtual crystal approximation approach deviates\nfrom that of the super-cell method. On the other hand in case of iso-electronic\nRu doping implemented by virtual crystal approximation, an extra shift of the\nchemical potential in electronic structure in comparison to super-cell method\nis observed and that shift can be used to predict the correct electronic\nstructure within virtual crystal approximation as reflected in our calculated\nFermi surfaces. But for higher Ru doping concentration, simple shifting of\nchemical potential does not work as the electronic structure calculated by\nvirtual crystal approximation approach is entirely different from that of the\ncalculated by super-cell formalism.\n", "  We present a study on the crystallization process of undoped and Ta doped\nTiO2 amorphous thin films. In particular, the effect of ultra-fast annealing\ntreatments in environments characterized by different oxygen concentrations is\ninvestigated via in-situ resistance measurements. The accurate examination of\nthe key parameters involved in this process allows us to reduce the time needed\nto obtain highly conducting and transparent polycrystalline thin films\n(resistivity about $6 \\times 10^{-4}$ {\\Omega}cm, mean transmittance in the\nvisible range about $81\\%$) to just 5 minutes (with respect to the 180 minutes\nrequired for a standard vacuum annealing treatment) in nitrogen atmosphere (20\nppm oxygen concentration) at ambient pressure. Experimental evidence of\nsuperficial oxygen incorporation in the thin films and its detrimental role for\nthe conductivity are obtained by employing different concentrations of\ntraceable 18O isotopes during ultra-fast annealing treatments. The results are\ndiscussed in view of the possible implementation of the ultra-fast annealing\nprocess for TiO2-based transparent conducting oxides as well as electron\nselective layers in solar cell devices; taking advantage of the high control of\nthe ultra-fast crystallization processes which has been achieved, these two\nfunctional layers are shown to be obtainable from the crystallization of a\nsingle homogeneous thin film.\n", "  We determine stability boundaries for the wrinkling of highly\nuni-directionally stretched, finely thin, rectangular elastic sheets. For a\ngiven fine thickness and length, a stability boundary here is a curve in the\nparameter plane, aspect ratio vs. the macroscopic strain; the values on one\nside of the boundary are associated with a flat, unwrinkled state, while\nwrinkled configurations correspond to all values on the other. In our recent\nwork we demonstrated the importance of finite elasticity in the membrane part\nof such a model in order to capture the correct phenomena. Here we present and\ncompare results for four distinct models:(i) the popular F\\\"oppl-von K\\'arm\\'an\nplate model (FvK), (ii) a correction of the latter, used in our earlier work,\nin which the approximate 2D F\\\"oppl strain tensor is replaced by the exact\nGreen strain tensor, (iii) and (iv): effective 2D finite-elasticity membrane\nmodels based on 3D incompressible neo-Hookean and Mooney-Rivlin materials,\nrespectively. In particular, (iii) and (iv) are superior models for elastomers.\nThe 2D nonlinear, hyperelastic models (ii)-(iv) all incorporate the same\nquadratic bending energy used in FvK. Our results illuminate serious\nshortcomings of the latter in this problem, while also pointing to inaccuracies\nof model (ii), in spite of yielding the correct qualitative phenomena in our\nearlier work. In each of these, the shortcoming is a due to a deficiency of the\nmembrane part of the model.\n", "  We prove the existence of diffusing solutions in the motion of a charged\nparticle in the presence of an ABC magnetic field. The equations of motion are\nmodeled by a 3DOF Hamiltonian system depending on two parameters. For small\nvalues of these parameters, we obtain a normally hyperbolic invariant manifold\nand we apply the so-called geometric methods for a priori unstable systems\ndeveloped by A. Delshams, R. de la Llave, and T.M. Seara. We characterize\nexplicitly sufficient conditions for the existence of a transition chain of\ninvariant tori having heteroclinic connections, thus obtaining global\ninstability (Arnold diffusion). We also check the obtained conditions in a\ncomputer assisted proof. ABC magnetic fields are the simplest force-free type\nsolutions of the magnetohydrodynamics equations with periodic boundary\nconditions, so our results are of potential interest in the study of the motion\nof plasma charged particles in a tokamak.\n", "  We provide a model-independent argument indicating that for a black hole of\nentropy N the non-thermal deviations from Hawking radiation, per each emission\ntime, are of order 1/N, as opposed to exp(-N). This fact abolishes the standard\na priory basis for the information paradox.\n", "  We study dark solitons near potential and nonlinearity steps and combinations\nthereof, forming rectangular barriers. This setting is relevant to the contexts\nof atomic Bose-Einstein condensates (where such steps can be realized by using\nproper external fields) and nonlinear optics (for beam propagation near\ninterfaces separating optical media of different refractive indices). We use\nperturbation theory to develop an equivalent particle theory, describing the\nmatter-wave or optical soliton dynamics as the motion of a particle in an\neffective potential. This Newtonian dynamical problem provides information for\nthe soliton statics and dynamics, including scenarios of reflection,\ntransmission, or quasi-trapping at such steps. The case of multiple such steps\nand its connection to barrier potentials is also touched upon. Our analytical\npredictions are found to be in very good agreement with the corresponding\nnumerical results.\n", "  Recently we studied Pad\\'e interpolation problems of $q$-grid, related to\n$q$-Painlev\\'e equations of type $E_7^{(1)}$, $E_6^{(1)}$, $D_5^{(1)}$,\n$A_4^{(1)}$ and $(A_2+A_1)^{(1)}$. By solving those problems, we could derive\nevolution equations, scalar Lax pairs and determinant formulae of special\nsolutions for the corresponding $q$-Painlev\\'e equations. It is natural that\nthe $q$-Painlev\\'e equations were derived by the interpolation method of\n$q$-grid, but it may be interesting in terms of differential grid that the\nPad\\'e interpolation method of differential grid (i.e. Pad\\'e approximation\nmethod) has been applied to the $q$-Painlev\\'e equation of type $D_5^{(1)}$ by\nY. Ikawa. In this paper we continue the above study and apply the Pad\\'e\napproximation method to the $q$-Painlev\\'e equations of type $E_6^{(1)}$,\n$D_5^{(1)}$, $A_4^{(1)}$ and $(A_2+A_1)^{(1)}$. Moreover determinant formulae\nof the special solutions for $q$-Painlev\\'e equation of type $E_6^{(1)}$ are\ngiven in terms of the terminating $q$-Appell Lauricella function.\n", "  We consider solutions to the linear wave equation in the interior region of\nextremal Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om black holes. We show that, under suitable\nassumptions on the initial data, the solutions can be extended continuously\nbeyond the Cauchy horizon and moreover, that their local energy is finite. This\nresult is in contrast with previously established results for subextremal\nReissner-Nordstr\\\"om black holes, where the local energy was shown to\ngenerically blow up at the Cauchy horizon.\n", "  The eigenvalue distribution of the sum of two large Hermitian matrices, when\none of them is conjugated by a Haar distributed unitary matrix, is\nasymptotically given by the free convolution of their spectral distributions.\nWe prove that this convergence also holds locally in the bulk of the spectrum,\ndown to the optimal scales larger than the eigenvalue spacing. The\ncorresponding eigenvectors are fully delocalized. Similar results hold for the\nsum of two real symmetric matrices, when one is conjugated by a Haar orthogonal\nmatrix.\n", "  The recently-developed notion of 'parity-time (PT) symmetry' in optical\nsystems with a controlled gain-loss interplay has spawned an intriguing way of\nachieving optical behaviors that are presently unattainable with standard\narrangements. In most experimental studies so far, however, the implementations\nrely highly on the advances of nanotechnologies and sophisticated fabrication\ntechniques to synthesize solid-state materials. Here, we report the first\nexperimental demonstration of optical anti-PT symmetry, a counterpart of\nconventional PT symmetry, in a warm atomic-vapor cell. By exploiting rapid\ncoherence transport via flying atoms, our scheme illustrates essential features\nof anti-PT symmetry with an unprecedented precision on phase-transition\nthreshold, and substantially reduces experimental complexity and cost. This\nresult represents a significant advance in non-Hermitian optics by bridging a\nfirm connection with the field of atomic, molecular and optical physics, where\nnovel phenomena and applications in quantum and nonlinear optics aided by\n(anti-)PT symmetry could be anticipated.\n", "  An influence of the electron-phonon interaction on excitation spectrum and\ndamping in a narrow band electron subsystem of cuprates has been investigated.\nWithin the framework of the t-J model an approach to solving a problem of\naccount of both strong electron correlations and local electron-phonon binding\nwith characteristic Einstein mode $\\omega _0$ in the normal state has been\npresented. In approximation Hubbard-I it was found an exact solution to the\npolaron bands. We established that in the low-dimensional system with a pure\nkinematic part of Hamiltonian a complicated excitation spectrum is realized. It\nis determined mainly by peculiarities of the lattice Green's function. In the\ndefinite area of the electron concentration and hopping integrals a correlation\ngap may be possible on the Fermi level. Also, in specific cases it is observed\na doping evolution of the Fermi surface. We found that the strong\nelectron-phonon binding enforces a degree of coherence of electron-polaron\nexcitations near the Fermi level and spectrum along the nodal direction depends\non wave vector module weakly. It corresponds to ARPES data. A possible origin\nof the experimentally observed kink in the nodal direction of cuprates is\nexplained by fine structure of the polaron band to be formed near the mode\n-$\\omega _0$.\n", "  We consider the Beltrami equation for hydrodynamics and we show that its\nsolutions can be viewed as instanton solutions of a more general system of\nequations. The latter are the equations of motion for an ${\\cal N}=2$ sigma\nmodel on 4-dimensional worldvolume (which is taken locally HyperK\\\"ahler) with\na 4-dimensional HyperK\\\"ahler target space. By means of the 4D twisting\nprocedure originally introduced by Witten for gauge theories and later\ngeneralized to 4D sigma-models by Anselmi and Fr\\'e, we show that the equations\nof motion describe triholomophic maps between the worldvolume and the target\nspace. Therefore, the classification of the solutions to the 3-dimensional\nBeltrami equation can be performed by counting the triholomorphic maps. The\ncounting is easily obtained by using several discrete symmetries. Finally, the\nsimilarity with holomorphic maps for ${\\cal N}=2$ sigma on Calabi-Yau space\nprompts us to reformulate the problem of the enumeration of triholomorphic maps\nin terms of a topological sigma model.\n", "  The main result of this note is the proof of degenerate quantum integrability\nof quantum spin Calogero--Moser systems and the description of the spectrum of\nquantum Hamiltonians in terms of the decomposition of tensor products of\nirreducible representations of corresponding Lie algebra.\n", "  We study a spin dependent Tomonaga-Luttinger model in one dimension, which\ndescribes electron transport through a single barrier. Using the Fermi-Bose\nequivalence in one dimension, we map the model onto a massless Thirring model\nwith a boundary interaction. A field theoretical perturbation theory for the\nmodel has been developed and the chiral symmetry is found to play an important\nrole. The classical bulk action possesses a global $U_A(1)^4$ chiral symmetry,\nsince the fermion fields are massless. This global chiral symmetry is broken by\nthe boundary interaction and the bosonic degrees of freedom, corresponding to\nthe chiral phase transformation, become dynamical. They acquire an additional\nkinetic action from the fermion path integral measure and govern the critical\nbehaviors of physical operators. On the critical line where the boundary\ninteraction becomes marginal, they decouple from the fermi fields. Consequently\nthe action reduces to the free field action, which contains only a fermion\nbilinear boundary mass term as an interaction term. By a renormalization group\nanalysis, we obtain a new critical line, which differs from the previously\nknown critical lines in the literature. The result of this work implies that\nthe phase diagram of the one dimensional electron system may have a richer\nstructure than previously known.\n", "  The motion of a particle in the potential well is studied when the particle\nis attached to the infinite elastic string. This is generic with the problem of\ndissipative quantum mechanics investigated by Caldeira and Leggett. Besides the\ndissipative motion there is another scenario of interaction of the string with\nthe particle attached. Stationary particle-string states exist with string\ndeformations accompanying the particle. This is like polaronic states in\nsolids. Our polaronic states in the well are non-decaying and with continuous\nenergy spectrum. Perhaps these states have a link to quantum electrodynamics.\nQuantum mechanical wave function, singular on some line, is smeared out by\nelectron \"vibrations\" due to the interaction with photons. In those anomalous\nstates the smeared singularity position would be analogous to the place where\nthe particle is attached to the string.\n", "  We discuss finite-size effects in one disordered ${\\lambda}{\\phi}^{4}$ model\ndefined in a $d$-dimensional Euclidean space. We consider that the scalar field\nsatisfies periodic boundary conditions in one dimension and it is coupled with\na quenched random field. In order to obtain the average value of the free\nenergy of the system we use the replica method. We first discuss finite-size\neffects in the one-loop approximation in $d=3$ and $d=4$. We show that in both\ncases there is a critical length where the system develop a second-order phase\ntransition, when the system presents long-range correlations with power-law\ndecay. Next, we improve the above result studying the gap equation for the\nsize- dependent squared mass, using the composite field operator method. We\nobtain again, that the system present a second order phase transition with\nlong-range correlation with power-law decay.\n", "  The classic question that how young massive star clusters attain their shapes\nand sizes, as we find them today, remains to be a challenge. Both observational\nand computational studies of star-forming massive molecular gas clouds infer\nthat massive cluster formation is primarily triggered along the small-scale\n($\\lesssim0.3$ pc) filamentary substructures within the clouds. The present\nstudy is intended to investigate the possible ways in which a\nfilament-like-compact, massive star cluster (effective radius 0.1-0.3 pc) can\nexpand $\\gtrsim10$ times, still remaining massive enough ($\\gtrsim10^4\nM_\\odot$), to become a young massive star cluster, as we observe today. To that\nend, model massive clusters (of initially $10^4 M_\\odot-10^5 M_\\odot$) are\nevolved using Sverre Aarseth's state-of-the-art N-body code NBODY7. All the\ncomputed clusters expand with time, whose sizes (effective radii) are compared\nwith those observed for young massive clusters, of age $\\lesssim100$ Myr, in\nthe Milky Way and other nearby galaxies. It is found that beginning from the\nabove compact sizes, a star cluster cannot expand by its own, i.e., due to\ntwo-body relaxation, stellar-evolutionary mass loss, dynamical heating by\nprimordial binaries and stellar-mass black holes, up to the observed sizes of\nyoung massive clusters; they always remain much more compact compared to the\nobserved ones. This calls for additional mechanisms that can boost the\nexpansion of a massive cluster after its assembly. Using further N-body\ncalculations, it is shown that a substantial residual gas expulsion, with\n$\\approx30$% star formation efficiency, can indeed swell the newborn embedded\ncluster adequately. The limitations of the present calculations and their\nconsequences are discussed.\n", "  Inspired by the discovery of two pentaquarks $P_{c}(4380)$ and $P_{c}(4450)$\nat the LHCb detector, we study possible hidden-charm molecular pentaquarks in\nthe framework of quark delocalization color screening model. Our results\nsuggest that both $N\\eta_{c}$ with $IJ^{P}=\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{1}{2}^{-}$ and\n$NJ/\\psi$ with $IJ^{P}=\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{3}{2}^{-}$ are bounded by channels\ncoupling. However, $NJ/\\psi$ with $IJ^{P}=\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{3}{2}^{-}$ may be a\nresonance state in the $D-$wave $N\\eta_{c}$ scattering process. Moreover,\n$P_{c}(4380)$ can be explained as the molecular pentaquark of $\\Sigma^{*}_{c}D$\nwith quantum numbers $IJ^{P}=\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{3}{2}^{-}$. The state\n$\\Sigma^{*}_{c}D^{*}$ with $IJ^{P}=\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{5}{2}^{-}$ is a resonance,\nit may not be a good candidate of the observed $P_{c}(4450)$ because of the\nopposite parity of the state to $P_{c}(4380)$, although the mass of the state\nis not far from the experimental value. In addition, the calculation is\nextended to the hidden-bottom pentaquarks, the similar properties as that of\nhidden-charm pentaquarks system are obtained.\n", "  We present the evolution of galaxy sizes, from redshift 2 to 0, for actively\nstar forming and passive galaxies in the cosmological hydrodynamical 1003 cMpc3\nsimulation of the EAGLE project. We find that the sizes increase with stellar\nmass , but that the relation weakens with increasing redshift. Separating\ngalaxies by their star formation activity, we find that passive galaxies are\ntypically smaller than active galaxies at fixed stellar mass. These trends are\nconsistent with those found in observations and the level of agreement between\nthe predicted and observed size - mass relation is of order 0.1 dex for z < 1\nand 0.2-0.3 dex from redshift 1 to 2. We use the simulation to compare the\nevolution of individual galaxies to that of the population as a whole. While\nthe evolution of the size-stellar mass relation for active galaxies provides a\ngood proxy for the evolution of individual galaxies, the evolution of\nindividual passive galaxies is not well represented by the observed size - mass\nrelation due to the evolving number density of passive galaxies. Observations\nof z \\approx 2 galaxies have revealed an abundance of massive red compact\ngalaxies, that depletes below z \\approx 1. We find that a similar population\nforms naturally in the simulation. Comparing these galaxies to their z = 0\ndescendants, we find that all compact galaxies grow in size due to the\nhigh-redshift stars migrating outwards. Approximately 60% of the compact\ngalaxies increase in size further due to renewed star formation and/or mergers.\n", "  The Fermi/LAT instrument has detected about two thousands Extragalactic High\nEnergy (E > 100 MeV) gamma-ray sources. One of the brightest is 3FGL\n1603.9-4903, associated to the radio source PMN J1603-4904. Its nature is not\nyet clear, it could be either a very peculiar BL Lac or a CSO (Compact\nSymmetric Object) radio source, considered as the early stage of a radio\ngalaxy. The latter, if confirmed, would be the first detection in gamma-rays\nfor this class of objects. Recently a redshift z=0.18 +/- 0.01 has been claimed\non the basis of the detection of a single X-ray line at 5.44 +/- 0.05 keV\ninterpreted as a 6.4 keV (rest frame) fluorescent line. We aim to investigate\nthe nature of 3FGL 1603.9-4903/PMN J1603-4904 using optical to NIR\nspectroscopy. We observed PMN J1603-4904 with the UV-NIR VLT/X-shooter\nspectrograph for two hours. We extracted spectra in the VIS and NIR range that\nwe calibrated in flux and corrected for telluric absorption and we\nsystematically searched for absorption and emission features. The source was\ndetected starting from ~6300 Ang down to 24000 Ang with an intensity comparable\nto the one of its 2MASS counterpart and a mostly featureless spectrum. The\ncontinuum lacks absorption features and thus is non-stellar in origin and\nlikely non-thermal. On top of this spectrum we detected three emission lines\nthat we interpret as the Halpha-[NII] complex, the [SII] 6716,6731 doublet and\nthe [SIII] 9530 line, obtaining a redshift estimate of z= 0.2321 +/- 0.0004.\nThe equivalent width of the Halpha-[NII] complex implies that PMN J1603-4904\ndoes not follow the observational definition of BL Lac, the line ratios suggest\nthat a LINER/Seyfert nucleus is powering the emission. This new redshift\nmeasurement implies that the X-ray line previously detected should be\ninterpreted as a 6.7 keV line which is very peculiar.\n", "  Quantum speed limit (QSL) time for open systems driven by classical fields is\nstudied in the presence of thermal bosonic environments. The decoherence\nprocess is quantitatively described by the time-convolutionless master\nequation. The evolution speed of an open system is related not only to the\nstrength of driving classical field but also to the environmental temperature.\nThe energy-state population plays a key role in the thermal QSL. Comparing with\nthe zero-temperature reservoir, we predict that the structural reservoir at low\ntemperatures may contribute to the acceleration of quantum decoherence. The\nmanifest oscillation of QSL time takes on under the circumstance of classical\ndriving fields. We also investigate the scaling property of QSL time for\nmulti-particle noninteracting entangled systems. It is demonstrated that\nentanglement of open systems can be considered as one resource for improving\nthe potential capacity of thermal quantum speedup.\n", "  Cells use temporal dynamical patterns to transmit information via signaling\npathways. As optimality with respect to the environment plays a fundamental\nrole in biological systems, organisms have evolved optimal ways to transmit\ninformation. Here, we use optimal control theory to obtain the dynamical signal\npatterns for the optimal transmission of information, in terms of efficiency\n(low energy) and reliability (low uncertainty). Adopting an\nactivation-deactivation decoding network, we reproduce several dynamical\npatterns found in actual signals, such as steep, gradual, and overshooting\ndynamics. Notably, when minimizing the energy of the input signal, the optimal\nsignals exhibit overshooting, which is a biphasic pattern with transient and\nsteady phases; this pattern is prevalent in actual dynamical patterns. We also\nidentify conditions in which these three patterns (steep, gradual, and\novershooting) confer advantages. Our study shows that cellular signal\ntransduction is governed by the principle of minimizing free energy dissipation\nand uncertainty; these constraints serve as selective pressures when designing\ndynamical signaling patterns.\n", "  The first plastic event occurring in discrete intermittent plasticity, as for\nexample a pop-in seen in nano-indentation, is evaluated with extreme value\nstatistics. It is found that when the same deformation is repeated many times,\nthe average of the stress at this first event is related to the deforming\nvolume via an exponentially truncated power-law. The present work demonstrates\nthis trend and the expected Weibull fluctuation around it. The statistical\nformalism is shown to apply to the nano-indentation data of Morris {\\em et al},\nPhys. Rev. Lett. 106, 165502 (2011), as well as to dislocation dynamics\nsimulations, which suggests a general phenomenon is at play. The truncated\npower law is found to uniquely determine an underlying critical stress master\nprobability density function in terms of the Lambert-W function and the density\nof discrete plastic events available to the crystal. Thus the developed\nprocedure allows for a quantitative characterization of a bulk material's\ninitial microstructure via a deformation experiment that probes discrete\nintermittent plasticity.\n", "  A complete classification of all low-order conservation laws is carried out\nfor a system of coupled semilinear wave equations which is a natural\ntwo-component generalization of the nonlinear Klein-Gordon equation. The\nconserved quantities defined by these conservation laws are derived and their\nphysical meaning is discussed.\n", "  The purpose of this work is to identify the field evaporation mechanism\nassociated with charge density distribution under extreme fields, linking atom\nprobe tomography (APT) experiments with density functional theory (DFT)\nmodeling. DFT is used to model a materials surface bonding, which affects the\nevaporation field of the surface atoms under high electric fields. We show how\nthe evaporation field of atoms is related to the charge density by comparing\nthe directionality and localization of the electrons with the evaporation of\nsingle ions versus dimers. This evaporation mechanism is important for the\nreconstruction of APT data, which is partially dependent on the input\nevaporation fields of the atoms. In $L1_{2}-Al_{3}Sc$, $Al-Al$ surface atoms\nare more likely to evaporate as dimers than $Al-Sc$ surface atoms. We find that\nthis is due to $Al-Al$ having a shared charge density, while $Al-Sc$ has an\nincreased density localized around the $Sc$ atom. Further, the role of\nsubsurface layers on the evaporation physics of the surface atoms as a function\nof charge density is considered. Beyond the practical considerations of\nimproving reconstruction of APT data, this work provides an approach for design\nof surface chemistry for extreme environments.\n", "  Using kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, we show that molecular morphologies\nfound in non-equilibrium growth can be strongly different from those at\nequilibrium. We study the prototypical hybrid inorganic-organic system 6P on\nZnO(10-10) during thin film adsorption, and find a wealth of phenomena\nincluding re-entrant growth, a critical adsorption rate and observables that\nare non-monotonous with the adsorption rate. We identify the transition from\nlying to standing molecules with a critical cluster size and discuss the\ncompetition of time scales during growth in terms of a rate equation approach.\nOur results form a basis for understanding and predicting collective\norientational ordering during growth in hybrid material systems.\n", "  Recent computational studies have reported evidence of a metastable\nliquid-liquid phase transition (LLPT) in molecular models of water under deeply\nsupercooled conditions. A competing hypothesis suggests, however, that\nnon-equilibrium artifacts associated with coarsening of the stable crystal\nphase have been mistaken for an LLPT in these models. Such artifacts are\nposited to arise due to a separation of time scales in which density\nfluctuations in the supercooled liquid relax orders of magnitude faster than\nthose associated with bond-orientational order. Here, we use molecular\nsimulation to investigate the relaxation of density and bond-orientational\nfluctuations in three molecular models of water (ST2, TIP5P and TIP4P/2005) in\nthe vicinity of their reported LLPT. For each model, we find that density is\nthe slowly relaxing variable under such conditions. We also observe similar\nbehavior in the coarse-grained mW model of water. Our findings therefore\nchallenge the key physical assumption underlying the competing hypothesis.e\nfind that density relaxes significantly faster than bond-orientational order,\nas incorrectly predicted by this competing hypothesis.\n", "  We present the particle creation probability rate around a general black hole\nas an outcome of quantum fluctuations. Using the uncertainty principle for\nthese fluctuation, we derive a new ultraviolet frequency cutoff for the\nradiation spectrum of a dynamical black hole. Using this frequency cutoff, we\ndefine the probability creation rate function for such black holes. We consider\na dynamical Vaidya model, and calculate the probability creation rate for this\ncase when its horizon is in a slowly evolving phase. Our results show that one\ncan expect the usual Hawking radiation emission process in the case of a\ndynamical black hole when it has a slowly evolving horizon. Moreover,\ncalculating the probability rate for a dynamical black hole gives a measure of\nwhen Hawking radiation can be killed off by an incoming flux of matter or\nradiation. Our result strictly suggests that we have to revise the Hawking\nradiation expectation for primordial black holes that have grown substantially\nsince they were created in the early universe. We also infer that this\nfrequency cut off can be a parameter that shows the primordial black hole\ngrowth at the emission moment.\n", "  Probabilistic forecasts in the form of ensemble of scenarios are required for\ncomplex decision making processes. Ensemble forecasting systems provide such\nproducts but the spatio-temporal structures of the forecast uncertainty is lost\nwhen statistical calibration of the ensemble forecasts is applied for each lead\ntime and location independently. Non-parametric approaches allow the\nreconstruction of spatio-temporal joint probability distributions at a low\ncomputational cost. For example, the ensemble copula coupling (ECC) method\nrebuilds the multivariate aspect of the forecast from the original ensemble\nforecasts. Based on the assumption of error stationarity, parametric methods\naim to fully describe the forecast dependence structures. In this study, the\nconcept of ECC is combined with past data statistics in order to account for\nthe autocorrelation of the forecast error. The new approach, called d-ECC, is\napplied to wind forecasts from the high resolution ensemble system COSMO-DE-EPS\nrun operationally at the German weather service. Scenarios generated by ECC and\nd-ECC are compared and assessed in the form of time series by means of\nmultivariate verification tools and in a product oriented framework.\nVerification results over a 3 month period show that the innovative method\nd-ECC outperforms or performs as well as ECC in all investigated aspects.\n", "  The standard uncertainty relations (UR) in quantum mechanics are typically\nused for unbounded operators (like the canonical pair). This implies the need\nfor the control of the domain problems. On the other hand, the use of (possibly\nbounded) functions of basic observables usually leads to more complex and less\nreadily interpretable relations. Also, UR may turn trivial for certain states\nif the commutator of observables is not proportional to a positive operator. In\nthis letter we consider a generalization of standard UR resulting from the use\nof two, instead of one, vector states. The possibility to link these states to\neach other in various ways adds additional flexibility to UR, which may\ncompensate some of the above mentioned drawbacks. We discuss applications of\nthe general scheme, leading not only to technical improvements, but also to\ninteresting new insight.\n", "  A method is developed to consider the particle-phonon coupling (PC) effects\nin the problem of finding odd-even double mass differences (DMD) of magic\nnuclei within the approach starting from the free $NN$-potential. Three PC\neffects are taken into account, the phonon induced interaction, the\nrenormalization of the \"ends\" due to the $Z$-factors and the change of the\nsingle-particle energies. We use the perturbation theory in $g^2_L$, where\n$g_L$ is the vertex of the $L$-phonon creation. PC corrections to\nsingle-particle energies are found self-consistently with an approximate\naccount for the so-called tadpole diagram. Results for double-magic $^{132}$Sn\nand $^{208}$Pb nuclei show that the PC corrections make agreement with the\nexperimental data better.\n", "  The appearance of the light Higgs boson at the LHC is difficult to explain,\nparticularly in light of naturalness arguments in quantum field theory. However\nlight scalars can appear in condensed matter systems when parameters (like the\namount of doping) are tuned to a critical point. At zero temperature these\nquantum critical points are directly analogous to the finely tuned standard\nmodel. In this paper we explore a class of models with a Higgs near a quantum\ncritical point that exhibits non-mean-field behavior. We discuss the\nparametrization of the effects of a Higgs emerging from such a critical point\nin terms of form factors, and present two simple realistic scenarios based on\neither generalized free fields or a 5D dual in AdS space. For both of these\nmodels we consider the processes $gg\\to ZZ$ and $gg\\to hh$, which can be used\nto gain information about the Higgs scaling dimension and IR transition scale\nfrom the experimental data.\n", "  The formation mechanism of ice banding in the system of freezing colloidal\nsuspensions, which is of significance in frost heaving, ice-templating porous\nmaterials and biological materials, still remains a mystery. Recently, the\ntheory of secondary nucleation and growth of ice has been proposed to explain\nthe emergence of a new ice lens. However, this theory has not been\nquantitatively examined. Here, we quantitatively measured the initial\ninterfacial undercooling of a new ice lens and the nucleation undercoolings of\nsuspensions. We found that the interfacial undercooling can not satisfy the\nnucleation undercooling of ice and hence disprove the secondary nucleation\nmechanism for ice banding.\n", "  Big Data has become the primary source of understanding the structure and\ndynamics of the society at large scale. The network of social interactions can\nbe considered as a multiplex, where each layer corresponds to one communication\nchannel and the aggregate of all of them constitutes the entire social network.\nHowever, usually one has information only about one of the channels or even a\npart of it, which should be considered as a subset or sample of the whole. Here\nwe introduce a model based on a natural bilateral communication channel\nselection mechanism, which for one channel leads to consistent changes in the\nnetwork properties. For example, while it is expected that the degree\ndistribution of the whole social network has a maximum at a value larger than\none, we get a monotonously decreasing distribution as observed in empirical\nstudies of single channel data. We also find that assortativity may occur or\nget strengthened due to the sampling method. We analyze the far-reaching\nconsequences of our findings.\n", "  The isotropic 4-wave kinetic equation is considered in its weak formulation\nusing model (simplified) homogeneous kernels. Existence and uniqueness of\nsolutions is proven in a particular setting where the kernels have a rate of\ngrowth at most linear. We also consider finite stochastic particle systems\nundergoing instantaneous coagulation- fragmentation phenomena and give\nconditions in which this system approximates the solution of the equation\n(mean-field limit).\n", "  We revisit the possibility of constraining the properties of dark matter (DM)\nby studying the epoch of cosmic reionization. Previous studies have shown that\nDM annihilation was unlikely to have provided a large fraction of the photons\nthat ionized the universe, but instead played a subdominant role relative to\nstars and quasars. The DM, however, begins to efficiently annihilate with the\nformation of primordial microhalos at $z\\sim100-200$, much earlier than the\nformation of the first stars. Therefore, if DM annihilation ionized the\nuniverse at even the percent level over the interval $z \\sim 20-100$, it can\nleave a significant imprint on the global optical depth, $\\tau$. Moreover, we\nshow that cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization data and future 21 cm\nmeasurements will enable us to more directly probe the DM contribution to the\noptical depth. In order to compute the annihilation rate throughout the epoch\nof reionization, we adopt the latest results from structure formation studies\nand explore the impact of various free parameters on our results. We show that\nfuture measurements could make it possible to place constraints on the dark\nmatter's annihilation cross section that are at a level comparable to those\nobtained from the observations of dwarf galaxies, cosmic ray measurements, and\nstudies of recombination.\n", "  Tungsten ditelluride (WTe2) has attracted significant attention due to its\ninteresting electronic properties, such as the unsaturated magnetoresistance\nand superconductivity. Recently, it has been proposed to be a new type of Weyl\nsemimetal, which is distinguished from other transition metal dichalcogenides\n(TMDs) from a topological prospective. Here, we study the structure of WTe2\nunder pressure with a crystal structure prediction and ab initio calculations\ncombined with high pressure synchrotron X-ray diffraction and Raman\nspectroscopy measurements. We find that the ambient orthorhombic structure (Td)\ntransforms into a monoclinic structure (1T') at around 4-5 GPa. As the\ntransition pressure is very close to the critical point in recent high-pressure\nelectrical transport measurements, the emergence of superconductivity in WTe2\nunder pressure is attributed to the Td-1T' structure phase transition, which\nassociates with a sliding mechanism of the TMD layers and results in a shorter\nTe-Te interlayer distance compared to the intralayer ones. These results\nhighlight the critical role of the interlayer stacking and chalcogen\ninteractions on the electronic and superconducting properties of multilayered\nTMDs under hydrostatic strain environments.\n", "  We employ the non-equilibrium thermodynamics of currents and forces to\ndescribe the heat transport caused by a spin current in a Pt/YIG bilayer. By\nstarting from the constitutive equations of the magnetization currents in both\nPt and YIG, we derive the magnetization potentials and currents. We apply the\ntheory to the spin Peltier experiments in which a spin current, generated by\nthe spin Hall effect in Pt, is injected into YIG. We find that efficient\ninjection is obtained when: i) the thickness of each layer is larger than its\ndiffusion length: $t_{Pt} > l_{Pt}$ and $t_{YIG} > l_{YIG}$ and ii) the ratio\n$(l_{Pt}/\\tau_{Pt})/(l_{YIG}/\\tau_{YIG})$ is small, where $\\tau_i$ is the time\nconstant of the intrinsic damping ($i=Pt, YIG$). We finally derive the\ntemperature profile in adiabatic conditions. The scale of the effect is given\nby the parameter $\\Delta T_{SH}$ which is proportional to the electric current\nin Pt. Using known parameters for Pt and YIG we estimate $\\Delta T_{SH}/j_e = 4\n\\cdot 10^{-13}$ K A$^{-1}$m$^2$. This value is of the same order of magnitude\nof the spin Peltier experiments.\n", "  Symmetry properties of conservation laws of partial differential equations\nare developed by using the general method of conservation law multipliers. As\nmain results, simple conditions are given for characterizing when a\nconservation law and its associated conserved quantity are invariant (and, more\ngenerally, homogeneous) under the action of a symmetry. These results are used\nto show that a recent conservation law formula (due to Ibragimov) is equivalent\nto a standard formula for the action of an infinitesimal symmetry on a\nconservation law multiplier.\n", "  In this note we investigate three-dimensional Schr\\\"odinger operators with\n$\\delta$-interactions supported on $C^2$-smooth cones, both finite and\ninfinite. Our main results concern a Faber-Krahn-type inequality for the\nprincipal eigenvalue of these operators. The proofs rely on the\nBirman-Schwinger principle and on the fact that circles are unique minimizers\nfor a class of energy functionals. The main novel idea consists in the way of\nconstructing test functions for the Birman-Schwinger principle.\n", "  Discovery of novel topological orders of condensed matters is of a\nsignificant interest in both fundamental and applied physics due to the\nassociated quantum conductance behaviors and unique symmetry-protected\nbackscattering-immune propagation against defects, which inspired similar\nfantastic effects in classical waves system, leading to the revolution of the\nmanipulation of wave propagation. To date, however, only few theoretical models\nwere proposed to realize acoustic topological states. Here, we theoretically\nand experimentally demonstrate a two dimensional acoustic topological\ninsulators with acoustic analogue of quantum spin Hall Effect. Due to the band\ninversion mechanism near the double Dirac cones, acoustic one-way pseudospin\ndependent propagating edge states, corresponding to spin-plus and spin-minus,\ncan be observed at the interface between two graphene-like acoustic crystals.\nWe have also experimentally verified the associated topological immunity of\nsuch one-way edge states against the different lattice defects and disorders,\nwhich can always lead to inherent propagation loss and noise. We show that this\nunique acoustic topological phenomenon can offer a new promising application\nplatform for the design of novel acoustic devices, such as one-way sound\nisolators, acoustic mode switchers, splitters, filters etc.\n", "  Studying a quantum field theory involves a choice of space-time manifold and\na choice of background for any global symmetries of the theory. We argue that\nmany more choices are possible when specifying the background. In the context\nof branes in string theory, the additional data corresponds to a choice of\nsupergravity tensor fluxes. We propose the existence of a landscape of field\ntheory backgrounds, characterized by the space-time metric, global symmetry\nbackground and a choice of tensor fluxes. As evidence for this landscape, we\nstudy the supersymmetric six-dimensional (2,0) theory compactified to two\ndimensions. Different choices of metric and flux give rise to distinct\ntwo-dimensional theories, which can preserve differing amounts of\nsupersymmetry.\n", "  The transport length $l_\\textrm{tr}$ and the mean free path $l_\\textrm{e}$\nare experimentally determined for bulk and surface states in a Bi$_2$Se$_3$\nnanoribbon by quantum transport and transconductance measurements. We show that\nthe anisotropic scattering of spin-helical Dirac fermions results in a strong\nenhancement of $l_\\textrm{tr}$, which confirms theoretical predictions\n\\cite{Culcer2010}. Despite strong disorder ($l_\\textrm{e}\\approx30$~nm), our\nresult further points to the long-range nature of the scattering potential,\ngiving a large ratio $l_\\textrm{tr}/l_\\textrm{e}\\approx8$ that is likely\nlimited by a finite bulk/surface coupling. This suggests that the spin-flip\nlength could reach the micron size in disordered 3D topological insulator\nnanostructures with a reduced bulk doping, even if due to charge compensation.\n", "  We analyse wave propagation in two-dimensional bianisotropic media with the\nFinite Element Method (FEM). We start from the Maxwell-Tellegen's equations in\nbianisotropic media, and derive some system of coupled Partial Difference\nEquations (PDEs) for longitudinal electric and magnetic field components.\nPerfectly Matched Layers (PMLs) are discussed to model such unbounded media. We\nimplement these PDEs and PMLs in a finite element software. We apply\ntransformation optics in order to design some bianisotropic media with\ninteresting functionalities, such as cloaks, concentrators and rotators. We\npropose a design of metamaterial with concentric layers made of homogeneous\nmedia with isotropic permittivity, permeability and magneto-electric parameters\nthat mimic the required effective anisotropic tensors of a bianisotropic cloak\nin the long wavelength limit (homogenization approach). Our numerical results\nshow that well-known metamaterials can be transposed to bianisotropic media.\n", "  We elaborate on the ambient space approach to boundary values of $AdS_{d+1}$\ngauge fields and apply it to massless fields of mixed-symmetry type. In the\nmost interesting case of odd-dimensional bulk the respective leading boundary\nvalues are conformal gauge fields subject to the invariant equations. Our\napproach gives a manifestly conformal and gauge covariant formulation for these\nfields. Although such formulation employs numerous auxiliary fields, it comes\nwith a systematic procedure for their elimination that results in a more\nconcise formulation involving only a reasonable set of auxiliaries, which\neventually (at least in principle) can be reduced to the minimal formulation in\nterms of the irreducible Lorentz tensors. The simplest mixed-symmetry field,\nnamely, the rank-3 tensor associated to the two-row Young diagram, is\nconsidered in some details.\n", "  In view of the properties of mesons in hot strongly interacting matter the\nproperties of the solutions of the truncated Dyson-Schwinger equation for the\nquark propagator at finite temperatures within the rainbow-ladder approximation\nare analysed in some detail. In Euclidean space within the Matsubara imaginary\ntime formalism the quark propagator is not longer a O(4) symmetric function and\npossesses a discrete spectra of the fourth component of the momentum. This\nmakes the treatment of the Dyson-Schwinger and Bethe-Salpeter equations\nconceptually different from the vacuum and technically much more involved. The\nquestion whether the interaction kernel known from vacuum calculations can be\napplied at finite temperatures remains still open. We find that, at low\ntemperatures, the model interaction with vacuum parameters provides a\nreasonable description of the quark propagator, while at temperatures higher\nthan a certain critical value $T_c$ the interaction requires stringent\nmodifications. The general properties of the quark propagator at finite\ntemperatures can be inferred from lattice QCD calculations. We argue that, to\nachieve a reasonable agreement of the model calculations with that from lattice\nQCD, the kernel is to be modified in such a way as to screen the infra-red part\nof the interaction at temperatures larger than $T_c$. For this, we analyse the\nsolutions of the truncated Dyson-Schwinger equation with existing interaction\nkernels in a large temperature range with particular attention on high\ntemperatures in order to find hints to an adequate temperature dependence of\nthe interaction kernel to be further implemented in to the Bethe-Salpeter\nequation for mesons. This will allow to investigate the possible in medium\nmodifications of the meson properties as well as the conditions of quark\ndeconfinement in hot matter.\n", "  Modern cosmology predicts that a galaxy overdensity is associated to a large\nreservoir of the intergalactic gas, which can be traced by the Ly$\\alpha$\nforest absorption. We have undertaken a systematic study of the relation\nbetween Coherently Strong intergalactic Ly$\\alpha$ Absorption systems (CoSLAs),\nwhich have highest optical depth ($\\tau$) in $\\tau$ distribution, and mass\noverdensities on the scales of $\\sim$ 10 - 20 $h^{-1}$ comoving Mpc. On such\nlarge scales, our cosmological simulations show a strong correlation between\nthe effective optical depth ($\\tau_{\\rm{eff}}$) of the CoSLAs and the 3-D mass\noverdensities. In moderate signal-to-noise spectra, however, the profiles of\nCoSLAs can be confused with high column density absorbers. For $z>2.6$, where\nthe corresponding Ly$\\beta$ is redshifted to the optical, we have developed the\ntechnique to differentiate between these two alternatives. We have applied this\ntechnique to SDSS-III quasar survey at $z = 2.6$ - 3.3, and we present a sample\nof five CoSLA candidates with $\\tau_{\\rm{eff}}$ on 15 $h^{-1}$ Mpc greater than\n$4.5\\times$ the mean optical depth. At lower redshifts of $z < 2.6$, where the\nbackground quasar density is higher, the overdensity can be traced by\nintergalactic absorption groups using multiple sight lines. Our overdensity\nsearches fully utilize the current and next generation of Ly$\\alpha$ forest\nsurveys which cover a survey volume of $> (1\\ h^{-1}$ Gpc)$^3$. In addition,\nsystems traced by CoSLAs will build a uniform sample of the most massive\noverdensities at $z > 2$ to constrain the models of structure formation, and\noffer a unique laboratory to study the interactions between galaxy\noverdensities and the intergalactic medium.\n", "  The energy spectrum of a neutrino beam in the few-GeV region is free of\nuncertainties from nuclear effects when reconstructed via neutrino-hydrogen\ninteractions. On a multinuclear (hydrogen containing) target such interactions\ncan be extracted using transverse kinematic imbalance. We discuss the prospects\nof this technique for current experiments.\n", "  We have studied the single particle heat engine and refrigerator driven by\ntime asymmetric protocol of finite duration. Our system consists of a particle\nin a harmonic trap with time-periodic strength that drives the particle\ncyclically between two baths. Each cycle consists of two isothermal steps at\ndifferent temperatures and two adiabatic steps connecting them. The system\nworks in irreversible mode of operation even in the quasistatic regime. This is\nindicated by finite entropy production even in the large cycle time limit.\nConsequently, Carnot efficiency for heat engine or Carnot Co-efficient of\nperformance (COP) for refrigerators are not achievable. We further analysed the\nphase diagram of heat engines and refrigerators. They are sensitive to\ntime-asymmetry of the protocol. Phase diagram shows several interesting\nfeatures, often counterintuitive. The distribution of stochastic efficiency and\nCOP is broad and exhibits power law tails.\n", "  The results from an investigation of the incoherent single pion electroweak\nproduction on the deuteron in the $\\Delta$(1232) region are reported. The\nimportance of including the nucleon-nucleon final state interactions in\nextracting the neutrino-nucleon cross sections from the data obtained from the\nexperiments on the deuteron target is demonstrated.\n", "  WIMPs are a well-motivated galactic dark matter candidate. Liquid argon (LAr)\nis an attractive target for the direct detection of WIMPs. The LAr prototype\ndetector is designed to study the technology and property of LAr detector. The\nprototype detector have an active volume containing 0.65 kg of liquid argon.\nThe liquid nitrogen(LN) cooling system allows the temperature of liquid argon\nto be maintained at the boiling point (87.8 K) with fluctuations less than 0.1\nK. The prototype was calibrated with a Na$^{22}$ source, with the light yield\n1.591$\\pm$0.019 p.e./keV for the 511 keV gamma rays using the domestic-made\nargon purification system.\n", "  In a conformal field theory with weakly broken higher spin symmetry, the\nleading order anomalous dimensions of the broken currents can be efficiently\ndetermined from the structure of the classical non-conservation equations. We\napply this method to the explicit example of $O(N)$ invariant scalar field\ntheories in various dimensions, including the large $N$ critical $O(N)$ model\nin general $d$, the Wilson-Fisher fixed point in $d=4-\\epsilon$, cubic scalar\nmodels in $d=6-\\epsilon$ and the nonlinear sigma model in $d=2+\\epsilon$. Using\ninformation from the $d=4-\\epsilon$ and $d=2+\\epsilon$ expansions, we obtain\nsome estimates for the dimensions of the higher spin operators in the critical\n3d $O(N)$ models for a few low values of $N$ and spin.\n", "  Very recently, the validity of the concept of negative temperature has been\nchallenged by several authors since they consider Boltzmann's entropy (that\nallows negative temperatures) inconsistent from a mathematical and statistical\npoint of view, whereas they consider Gibbs' entropy (that does not admit\nnegative temperatures) the correct definition for microcanonical entropy.\n  In the present paper we prove that for systems with equivalence of the\nstatistical ensembles Boltzmann entropy is the correct microcanonical entropy.\nAnalytical results on two systems supporting negative temperatures, confirm the\nscenario we propose. In addition, we corroborate our proof by numeric\nsimulations on an explicit lattice system showing that negative temperature\nequilibrium states are accessible and obey standard statistical mechanics\nprevision.\n", "  We describe a micromachining process to allow the coupling of an array of\nsingle-mode telecommunication fibers to individual superconducting nanowire\nsingle photon detectors (SNSPDs). As proof of principle, we show the\nintegration of four detectors on the same silicon chip, including two standard\nsingle-section nanowire detectors and two superconducting nanowire avalanche\nphotodetectors (SNAPs) with modified series structure without external\ninductor, and their performances are compared. The SNAP shows saturated system\ndetection efficiency of 16% while the dark count rate is less than 20 Hz,\nwithout the use of photon-recycling reflectors. The SNAP also demonstrates\ndoubled signal-to-noise ratio, reduced reset time (~ 4.9 ns decay time) and\nimproved timing jitter (62 ps FWHM) compared to standard SNSPDs.\n", "  We present a superconducting metamaterial saturable absorber at terahertz\nfrequencies. The absorber consists of an array of split ring resonators (SRRs)\netched from a 100nm YBaCu3O7 (YBCO) film. A polyimide spacer layer and gold\nground plane are deposited above the SRRs, creating a reflecting perfect\nabsorber. Increasing either the temperature or incident electric field (E)\ndecreases the superconducting condensate density and corresponding kinetic\ninductance of the SRRs. This alters the impedance matching in the metamaterial,\nreducing the peak absorption. At low electric fields, the absorption was\noptimized near 80% at T=10K and decreased to 20% at T=70K. For E=40kV/cm and\nT=10K, the peak absorption was 70% decreasing to 40% at 200kV/cm, corresponding\nto a modulation of 43%.\n", "  Wires of sp-hybridized carbon atoms are attracting interest for both\nfundamental aspects of carbon science and for their appealing functional\nproperties. The synthesis by physical vapor deposition has been reported to\nprovide sp-rich carbon films but still needs to be further developed and\nunderstood in detail. Here the synthesis of carbon-atom wires (CAWs) has been\nachieved by nanosecond pulsed laser deposition (PLD) expoliting the strong\nout-of-equilibrium conditions occurring when the ablation plasma is confined in\na background gas. Surface Enhnaced Raman scattering (SERS) spectra of deposited\nfilms indicates that CAWs are mixed with a mainly $sp^2$ amorphous carbon in a\n$sp-sp^2$ hybrid material. Optimal conditions for the deposition of sp-carbon\nphase have been investigated by changing deposition parameters thus suggesting\nbasic mechanisms of carbon wires formation. Our proof-of-concept may open new\nperspectives for the targeted fabrication of CAWs and $sp-sp^2$ structures.\n", "  The quantum internet holds promise for performing quantum communication, such\nas quantum teleportation and quantum key distribution (QKD), freely between any\nparties all over the globe. Such a future quantum network, depending on the\ncommunication distance of the requesting parties, necessitates to invoke\nseveral classes of optical quantum communication such as point-to-point\ncommunication protocols, intercity QKD protocols and quantum repeater\nprotocols. Recently, Takeoka, Guha and Wilde (TGW) have presented a fundamental\nrate-loss tradeoff on quantum communication capacity and secret key agreement\ncapacity of any lossy channel assisted by unlimited forward and backward\nclassical communication [Nat. Commun. 5, 5235 (2014)]. However, this bound is\napplicable only to the simplest class of quantum communication, i.e., the\npoint-to-point communication protocols, and it has thus remained open to grasp\nthe potential of a `worldwide' quantum network. Here we generalize the TGW\nbound to be applicable to any type of two-party quantum communication over the\nquantum internet, including other indispensable but much more intricate classes\nof quantum communication, intercity QKD protocols and quantum repeater\nprotocols. We also show that there is essentially no scaling gap between our\nbound and the quantum communication efficiencies of known protocols. Therefore,\nour result, corresponding to a fundamental and practical limitation for the\nquantum internet, will contribute to design an efficient quantum internet in\nthe future.\n", "  We study a class of gravitational lensing systems consisting of an inclined\nring/belt, with and without an added point mass at the centre. We show that a\ncommon feature of such systems are so-called \"pseudo-caustics\", across which\nthe magnification of a point source changes discontinuously and yet remains\nfinite. Such a magnification change can be associated with either a change in\nimage multiplicity or a sudden change in the size of a lensed image. The\nexistence of pseudo-caustics and the complex interplay between them and the\nformal caustics (which correspond to points of infinite magnification) can lead\nto interesting consequences, such as truncated or open caustics and a\nnon-conservation of total image parity. The origin of the pseudo-caustics is\nfound to be the non-differentiability of the solutions to the lens equation\nacross the ring/belt boundaries, with the pseudo-caustics corresponding to\nring/belt boundaries mapped into the source plane. We provide a few\nillustrative examples to understand the pseudo-caustic features, and in a\nseparate paper consider a specific astronomical application of our results to\nstudy microlensing by extrasolar asteroid belts.\n", "  We propose that extrasolar asteroid belts can be detected through their\ngravitational microlensing signatures. Asteroid belt + star lens systems create\nso-called \"pseudo-caustics\", regions in the source plane where the\nmagnification exhibits a finite but discontinuous jump. These features allow\nsuch systems to generate distinctive signatures in the microlensing light\ncurves for a wide range of belt configurations, with source trajectories as far\nas tenths of the Einstein ring radius from the centre of the lens. Sample light\ncurves for a range of asteroid belt parameters are presented. In the near\nfuture, space-based microlensing surveys like WFIRST, which will have the power\nto detect percent-level changes in microlensing light curves even with\nsub-minute exposure times, may be able to discover extrasolar asteroid belts\nwith masses of the order of an earth mass.\n", "  Artificial micro heat engines are prototypical models to explore and\nelucidate the mechanisms of energy transduction in a regime that is dominated\nby fluctuations [1-2]. Micro heat engines realized hitherto mimicked their\nmacroscopic counterparts and operated between reservoirs that were effectively\nthermal [3-7]. For such reservoirs, temperature is a well-defined state\nvariable and stochastic thermodynamics provides a precise framework for\nquantifying engine performance [8-9]. It remains unclear whether these concepts\nreadily carry over to situations where the reservoirs are out-of-equilibrium\n[10], a scenario of particular importance to the functioning of synthetic\n[11-12] and biological [13] micro engines and motors. Here we experimentally\nrealized a micrometer-sized active Stirling engine by periodically cycling a\ncolloidal particle in a time-varying harmonic optical potential across\nbacterial baths at different activities. Unlike in equilibrium thermal\nreservoirs, the displacement statistics of the trapped particle becomes\nincreasingly non-Gaussian with activity. We show that as much as $\\approx$ 85\\%\nof the total power output and $\\approx$ 50\\% of the overall efficiency stems\nfrom large non-Gaussian particle displacements alone. Most remarkably, at the\nhighest activities investigated, the efficiency of our quasi-static active heat\nengines surpasses the equilibrium saturation limit of Stirling efficiency - the\nmaximum efficiency of a Stirling engine with the ratio of cold and hot\nreservoir temperatures ${T_C\\over T_H} \\to 0$. Crucially, the failure of\neffective temperature descriptions [14-16] for active reservoirs highlights the\ndire need for theories that can better capture the physics of micro motors and\nheat engines that operate in strongly non-thermal environments.\n", "  We build the first 3-3-1 model based on the $\\Delta (27)$ discrete group\nsymmetry, consistent with fermion masses and mixings. In the model under\nconsideration, the neutrino masses are generated from a combination of type-I\nand type-II seesaw mechanisms mediated by three heavy right-handed Majorana\nneutrinos and three $SU(3)_{L}$ scalar antisextets, respectively. Furthermore,\nfrom the consistency of the leptonic mixing angles with their experimental\nvalues, we obtain a non-vanishing leptonic Dirac CP violating phase of\n$-\\frac{\\pi }{2}$. Our model features an effective Majorana neutrino mass\nparameter of neutrinoless double beta decay, with values $m_{\\beta \\beta }=$ 10\nand 18 meV for the normal and the inverted neutrino mass hierarchies,\nrespectively.\n", "  We consider the time-dependence of a hierarchy of scaled $L^{2m}$-norms\n$D_{m,\\omega}$ and $D_{m,\\theta}$ of the vorticity $\\boldsymbol {\\omega} =\n\\boldsymbol{\\nabla} \\times {\\mathbf u}$ and the density gradient\n$\\boldsymbol{\\nabla} \\theta$, where $\\theta=\\log (\\rho^*/\\rho^*_0)$, in a\nbuoyancy-driven turbulent flow as simulated by \\cite{LR2007}. $\\rho^*({\\mathbf\nx},\\,t) $ is the composition density of a mixture of two incompressible\nmiscible fluids with fluid densities $\\rho^*_2 > \\rho^*_1$ and $\\rho^*_{0}$ is\na reference normalisation density. Using data from the publicly available Johns\nHopkins Turbulence Database we present evidence that the $L^{2}$-spatial\naverage of the density gradient $\\boldsymbol{\\nabla} \\theta$ can reach\nextremely large values, even in flows with low Atwood number $At = (\\rho^*_{2}\n- \\rho^*_{1})/(\\rho^*_{2} + \\rho^*_{1}) = 0.05$, implying that very strong\nmixing of the density field at small scales can arise in buoyancy-driven\nturbulence. This large growth raises the possibility that the density gradient\n$\\boldsymbol{\\nabla} \\theta$ might blow up in a finite time.\n", "  High precision and large dynamic range measurement are required in the\nreadout systems for the Water Cherenkov Detector Array (WCDA) in Large High\nAltitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO). This paper presents a prototype of\n12-bit 40 MSPS Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) Application Specific\nIntegrated Circuit (ASIC) designed for the readout of LHAASO WCDA. Combining\nthis ADC and the front-end ASIC finished in our previous work, high precision\ncharge measurement can be achieved based on the digital peak detection method.\nThis ADC is implemented based on power-efficient Successive Approximation\nRegister (SAR) architecture, which incorporates the key parts such as\nCapacitive Digital-to-Analog Converter (CDAC), dynamic comparator and\nasynchronous SAR control logic. The simulation results indicate that the\nEffective Number Of Bits (ENOB) with a sampling rate of 40 MSPS is better than\n10 bits in an input frequency range below 20 MHz, while its core power\nconsumption is 6.6 mW per channel. The above results are good enough for the\nreadout requirements of the WCDA.\n", "  We quantify and analyze the controller's power in controlled remote state\npreparation schemes. Our analysis provides a lower bound on the control power\nrequired for controlled remote preparation of arbitrary D-dimensional states.\nWe evaluate several existing controlled remote state preparation protocols and\nshow that some proposed non-maximally entangled channels are not suitable for\nperfect controlled remote preparation of arbitrary quantum states from the con-\ntroller's point of view. We find that for remotely preparing D-dimensional\nstates, the entropy of each controller should be no less than log_2 D bits. Our\ncriteria are not only useful for evaluating controlled remote state preparation\nschemes but can also be used for other controlled quantum communication\nschemes.\n", "  We first propose and study a quantum toy model of black hole dynamics. The\nmodel is unitary, displays quantum thermalization, and the Hamiltonian couples\nevery oscillator with every other, a feature intended to emulate the color\nsector physics of large-$\\mathcal{N}$ matrix models. Considering out of\nequilibrium initial states, we analytically compute the time evolution of every\ncorrelator of the theory and of the entanglement entropies, allowing a proper\ndiscussion of global thermalization/scrambling of information through the\nentire system. Microscopic non-locality causes factorization of reduced density\nmatrices, and entanglement just depends on the time evolution of occupation\ndensities. In the second part of the article, we show how the gained intuition\nextends to large-$\\mathcal{N}$ matrix models, where we provide a gauge\ninvariant entanglement entropy for `generalized free fields', again depending\nsolely on the quasinormal frequencies. The results challenge the fast\nscrambling conjecture and point to a natural scenario for the emergence of the\nso-called brick wall or stretched horizon. Finally, peculiarities of these\nmodels in regards to the thermodynamic limit and the information paradox are\nhighlighted.\n", "  We have obtained a low optical inhomogeneous linewidth of 25 MHz in the\nstoichiometric rare earth crystal EuCl3 .6H2 O by isotopically purifying the\ncrystal in 35 Cl. With this linewidth, an important limit for stoichiometric\nrare earth crystals is surpassed: the hyperfine structure of 153Eu is\nspectrally resolved, allowing the whole population of 153Eu3+ ions to be\nprepared in the same hyperfine state using hole burning techniques. This\nmaterial also has a very high optical density and can have long coherence times\nwhen deuterated. This combination of properties offers new prospects for\nquantum information applications. We consider two of these, quantum memories\nand quantum many body studies. We detail the improvements in the performance of\ncurrent memory protocols possible in these high optical depth crystals, and how\ncertain memory protocols, such as off-resonant Raman memories, can be\nimplemented for the first time in a solid state system. We explain how the\nstrong excitation-induced interactions observed in this material resemble those\nseen in Rydberg systems, and describe how these interactions can lead to\nquantum many-body states that could be observed using standard optical\nspectroscopy techniques.\n", "  We employ the Stern-Gerlach experiment to highlight the basics of a\nminimalist, non-interpretational top-down approach to quantum foundations.\nCertain benefits of the here highlighted \"quantum structural studies\" are\ndetected and discussed. While the top-down approach can be described without\nmaking any reference to the fundamental structure of a closed system, the\nhidden variables theory ?a la Bohm proves to be more subtle than it is\ntypically regarded.\n", "  In a previous work [S. Rahbardehghan et al. in Phys. Lett. B 750, 627\n(2015)], we considered a simple brane-world model; a single $4$-dimensional\nbrane embedded in a $5$-dimensional de Sitter (dS) space-time. Then, by\nincluding a conformally coupled scalar field in the bulk, we studied the\ninduced Casimir energy-momentum tensor. Technically, the Krein-Gupta-Bleuler\n(KGB) quantization scheme as a covariant and renormalizable quantum field\ntheory in dS space was used to perform the calculations. In the present paper,\nwe generalize this study to a less idealized, but physically motivated,\nscenario, namely we consider Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) space-time which\nbehaves asymptotically as a dS space-time. More precisely, we evaluate Casimir\nenergy-momentum tensor for a system with two $D$-dimensional curved branes on\nbackground of $D+1$-dimensional FRW space-time with negative spatial curvature\nand a conformally coupled bulk scalar field that satisfies Dirichlet boundary\ncondition on the branes.\n", "  The bulk moduli of PbS$_{x}$Se$_{1-x}$, PbS$_{x}$Te$_{1-x}$, and\nPbSe$_{x}$Te$_{1-x}$ have been recently determined [E. Skordas, Materials\nScience in Semiconductor Processing 43 (2016) 65-68] by employing a\nthermodynamical model, the so called $cB\\Omega$ model, which has been found to\ngive successful results in several applications of defects in solids. Here, we\nsuggest an alternative procedure for this determination which combines the\n$cB\\Omega$ model with the modified Born theory. The results are in satisfactory\nagreement with those deduced independently by the generalized gradient\napproximation approach.\n", "  We revisit the Lichnerowicz-York method, and an alternative method of York,\nin order to obtain some conformally covariant systems. This type of\nparameterization is certainly more natural for non constant mean curvature\ninitial data.\n", "  What characterises a solid is its way to respond to external stresses.\nOrdered solids, such crystals, display an elastic regime followed by a plastic\none, both well understood microscopically in terms of lattice distortion and\ndislocations. For amorphous solids the situation is instead less clear, and the\nmicroscopic understanding of the response to deformation and stress is a very\nactive research topic. Several studies have revealed that even in the elastic\nregime the response is very jerky at low temperature, resembling very much the\none of disordered magnetic materials. Here we show that in a very large class\nof amorphous solids this behaviour emerges by decreasing the temperature as a\nphase transition where standard elastic behaviour breaks down. At the\ntransition all non-linear elastic modulii diverge and standard elasticity\ntheory does not hold anymore. Below the transition the response to deformation\nbecomes history and time-dependent.\n", "  In a pioneering paper on the role of gravity on false vacuum decay, Coleman\nand De Luccia showed that a strong gravitational field can stabilize the false\nvacuum, suppressing the formation of true vacuum bubbles. This result is\nobtained for the case when the energy density difference between the two vacua\nis small, the so called thin wall regime, but is considered of more general\nvalidity. Here we show that when this condition does not hold, however, {\\it a\nstrong gravitational field (Planckian physics) does not necessarily induce a\ntotal suppression of true vacuum bubble nucleation}. Contrary to common\nexpectations then, gravitational physics at the Planck scale {\\it does not\nstabilize the false vacuum}. These results are of crucial importance for the\nstability analysis of the electroweak vacuum and for searches of new physics\nbeyond the Standard Model.\n", "  Bound states arise in many interactions among elementary field states, and\nare represented by poles in the scattering matrix. The emergent nature of bound\nstates suggests that they play a perhaps under-appreciated role in specifying\nthe ontologically relevant degrees of freedom pertaining to composite systems.\nThe basics of this ontology are presented, and it is discussed in light of an\nexample of Arsenijevi\\' c et al.\n", "  It is argued that Niels Bohr ultimately arrived at positivistic and\nantirealist-flavored statements because of weaknesses in his initial objective\nof accounting for measurement in physical terms. Bohr's investigative approach\nfaced a dilemma, the choices being (i) conceptual inconsistency or (ii) taking\nthe classical realm as primitive. In either case, Bohr's `Complementarity' does\nnot adequately explain or account for the emergence of a macroscopic, classical\ndomain from a microscopic domain described by quantum mechanics. A diagnosis of\nthe basic problem is offered, and an alternative way forward is indicated.\n", "  In this article, we consider the Kapustin-Witten equations on a closed\n$4$-manifold. We study certain analytic properties of solutions to the\nequations on a closed manifold. The main result is that there exists an\n$L^{2}$-lower bound on the extra fields over a closed four-manifold satisfying\ncertain conditions if the connections are not ASD connections. Furthermore, we\nalso obtain a similar result about the Vafa-Witten equations.\n", "  This paper considers the whole hierarchy of bi-Hamiltonian integrable\nequations associated to each of the Short-Pulse (SP) equation and the\nSine-Gordon (SG) equation. We prove that the transformation that relates the SP\nequation with the SG equation also serves to establish the correspondence\nbetween their flows and Hamiltonian conservation laws in respective hierarchy.\n", "  Current and future neutrino oscillation experiments utilize information of\nhadronic final states to improve sensitivities on oscillation parameters\nmeasurements. Among the physics of hadronic systems in neutrino interactions,\nthe hadronization model controls multiplicities and kinematics of final state\nhadrons from the primary interaction vertex. For relatively high invariant mass\nevents, neutrino interaction generators rely on the PYTHIA6 hadronization\nprogram. Here, we show a possible improvement of this process in neutrino event\ngenerators, by utilizing expertise from the HERMES experiment. Next, we discuss\nthe possibility to implement the PYTHIA8 program in neutrino interaction\ngenerators, including GENIE and NEUT. Finally, we show preliminary comparisons\nof PYTHIA8 predictions with neutrino hadron multiplicity data from bubble\nchamber experiments within the GENIE hadronization validation tool.\n", "  We study the chiral-imbalance and the Weibel instabilities in presence of the\nquantum anomaly using the Berry-curvature modified kinetic equation. We argue\nthat in many realistic situations, e.g. relativistic heavy-ion collisions, both\nthe instabilities can occur simultaneously. The Weibel instability depends on\nthe momentum anisotropy parameter $\\xi$ and the angle ($\\theta_n$) between the\npropagation vector and the anisotropy direction. It has maximum growth rate at\n$\\theta_n=0$ while $\\theta_n=\\pi/2$ corresponds to a damping. On the other hand\nthe pure chiral-imbalance instability occurs in an isotropic plasma and depends\non difference between the chiral chemical potentials of right and left-handed\nparticles. It is shown that when $\\theta_n=0$, only for a very small values of\nthe anisotropic parameter $\\xi\\sim \\xi_c$, growth rates of the both\ninstabilities are comparable. For the cases $\\xi_c<\\xi\\ll1$, $\\xi\\approx 1$ or\n$\\xi \\geq 1$ at $\\theta_n=0$, the Weibel modes dominate over the\nchiral-imbalance instability if $\\mu_5/T\\leq1$. However, when $\\mu_5/T\\geq1$,\nit is possible to have dominance of the chiral-imbalance modes at certain\nvalues of $\\theta_n$ for an arbitrary $\\xi$.\n", "  We propose a probabilistic growth model for transport networks which employs\na balance between popularity of nodes and the physical distance between nodes.\nBy comparing the degree of each node in the model network and the WAN, we\nobserve that the difference between the two is minimized for $\\alpha\\approx 2$.\nInterestingly, this is the value obtained for the node-node correlation\nfunction in the WAN. This suggests that our model explains quite well the\ngrowth of airline networks.\n", "  Brillouin scattering is not usually considered as a mechanism that can cause\ncooling of a material due to the thermodynamic dominance of Stokes scattering\nin most practical systems. However, it has been shown in experiments on\nresonators that net phonon annihilation through anti-Stokes Brillouin\nscattering can be enabled by means of a suitable set of optical and acoustic\nstates. The cooling of traveling phonons in a linear waveguide, on the other\nhand, could lead to the exciting future prospect of manipulating unidirectional\nphonon fluxes and even the nonreciprocal transport of quantum information via\nphonons. In this work, we present an analysis of the conditions under which\nBrillouin cooling of phonons of both low and high group velocities may be\nachieved in a linear waveguide. We analyze the three-wave mixing interaction\nbetween the optical and traveling acoustic modes that participate in forward\nBrillouin scattering, and reveal the key regimes of operation for the process.\nOur calculations indicate that measurable cooling may occur in a system having\nphonons with spatial loss rate that is of the same order as the spatial optical\nloss rate. If the Brillouin gain in such a waveguide reaches the order of\n10$^{5}$ m$^{-1}$W$^{-1}$, appreciable cooling of phonon modes may be observed\nwith modest pump power of a few mW.\n", "  Based on the weakly-coupled two-Higgs-doublet model with spontaneous\nCP-violation (named Lee model) and the mechanism to generate the correlation\nbetween smallness of CP-violation and lightness of scalar mass, as we proposed\nearlier, we predicted a light CP-mixing scalar $\\eta$ in which pseudoscalar\ncomponent is dominant. It is a natural scenario in which\n$m_{\\eta}\\sim\\mathcal{O}(10\\textrm{GeV})\\ll v$. Masses of all other scalars\n($h$, $H$, $H^\\pm$) should be around the electro-weak scale $v$. Among them,\nthe 125 GeV Higgs ($h$) couplings are standard-model like, and the charged\nHiggs ($H^\\pm$) mass should be around the heaviest neutral scalar ($H$) mass.\nWe discussed all experimental constraints and showed that this scenario is\nstill allowed by data. The strictest constraints come from the experiments of\nthe flavor-changing processes and the EDM of lepton and neutron. We also\ndiscussed the future tests for this scenario. It is possible to discover the\nextra scalars or exclude this scenario at future colliders, especially at the\nLHC and $e^+e^-$ colliders with $\\mathcal{O}(\\textrm{ab}^{-1})$ luminosity. We\nalso pointed out that the $Z$-mediated Higgs pair production via\n$e^+e^-\\rightarrow h_ih_j$ ($h_i, h_j$ stand for two of the $\\eta, h, H$) would\nbe the key observable to confirm or exclude CP-violation in Higgs sector. The\nsensitivity to test this scenario is worth further studying in greater detail.\n", "  We investigate the structure of representations of the (positive half of the)\nVirasoro algebra and situations in which they decompose as a tensor product of\nLie algebra representations. As an illustration, we apply these results to the\ndifferential operators defined by the Virasoro conjecture and obtain some\nfactorization properties of the solutions as well as a link to the\nmulticomponent KP hierarchy.\n", "  We classify possible supersymmetry-preserving relevant, marginal, and\nirrelevant deformations of unitary superconformal theories in $d \\geq 3$\ndimensions. Our method only relies on symmetries and unitarity. Hence, the\nresults are model independent and do not require a Lagrangian description. Two\nunifying themes emerge: first, many theories admit deformations that reside in\nmultiplets together with conserved currents. Such deformations can lead to\nmodifications of the supersymmetry algebra by central and non-central charges.\nSecond, many theories with a sufficient amount of supersymmetry do not admit\nrelevant or marginal deformations, and some admit neither. The classification\nis complicated by the fact that short superconformal multiplets display a rich\nvariety of sporadic phenomena, including supersymmetric deformations that\nreside in the middle of a multiplet. We illustrate our results with examples in\ndiverse dimensions. In particular, we explain how the classification of\nirrelevant supersymmetric deformations can be used to derive known and new\nconstraints on moduli-space effective actions.\n", "  The New Iram Kid Arrays-2 (NIKA2) instrument has recently been installed at\nthe IRAM 30 m telescope. NIKA2 is a state-of-art instrument dedicated to\nmm-wave astronomy using microwave kinetic inductance detectors (KID) as\nsensors. The three arrays installed in the camera, two at 1.25 mm and one at\n2.05 mm, feature a total of 3300 KIDs. To instrument these large array of\ndetectors, a specifically designed electronics, composed of 20 readout boards\nand hosted in three microTCA crates, has been developed. The implemented\nsolution and the achieved performances are presented in this paper. We find\nthat multiplexing factors of up to 400 detectors per board can be achieved with\nhomogeneous performance across boards in real observing conditions, and a\nfactor of more than 3 decrease in volume with respect to previous generations.\n", "  Non-thermal dynamical critical behavior can arise in isolated quantum systems\nbrought out of equilibirum by a change in time of their parameters. While this\nphenomenon has been studied in a variety of systems in the case of a sudden\nquench, here we consider its sensitivity to a change of protocol by considering\nthe experimentally relevant case of a linear ramp in time. Focusing on the\n$O(N)$ model in the large $N$ limit, we show that a dynamical phase transition\nis always present for all ramp durations and discuss the resulting crossover\nbetween the sudden quench transition and one dominated by the equilibrium\nquantum critical point. We show that the critical behavior of the statistics of\nthe excitations, signaling the non-thermal nature of the transition are robust\nagainst changing protocol. An intriguing crossover in the equal time\ncorrelation function, related to an anomalous coarsening is also discussed.\n", "  We discuss nuclear effects on neutrino-nuclear interactions in a wide\nkinematical range from shallow to deep inelastic scattering (DIS) region. There\nis necessity from neutrino communities to have precise neutrino-nucleus cross\nsections for future measurements on neutrino oscillations and leptonic CP\nviolation. We try to create a model to calculate neutrino cross sections in the\nwide kinematical range, from quasi-elastic scattering and resonance productions\nto the DIS. In this article, nuclear modifications of structure functions are\nmainly discussed, and a possible extension to the $Q^2 \\to 0$ region is\nexplained. We also comment on the transition region between baryon resonances\nand the DIS. There are ongoing experimental efforts on nuclear modifications of\nstructure functions or parton distribution functions such as by pA reactions at\nRHIC and LHC, Drell-Yan measurements at Fermilab, Miner$\\nu$a neutrino DIS, and\ncharged-lepton DIS at JLab.\n", "  In perturbative SU(N) Chern-Simons gauge theory, it is shown that the\nSchwinger-Dyson equations assume a quite simplified form. The generating\nfunctional of the correlation functions of the curvature is considered; it is\ndemonstrated that the renormalized Schwinger-Dyson functional is related with\nthe generating functional of the correlation functions of the gauge connections\nby some kind of duality transformation.\n", "  We study mean-field classical $N$-vector models, for integers $N\\ge 2$. We\nuse the theory of large deviations and Stein's method to study the total spin\nand its typical behavior, specifically obtaining non-normal limit theorems at\nthe critical temperatures and central limit theorems away from criticality.\nImportant special cases of these models are the XY ($N=2$) model of\nsuperconductors, the Heisenberg ($N=3$) model (previously studied in \\cite{KM}\nbut with a correction to the critical distribution here), and the Toy ($N=4$)\nmodel of the Higgs sector in particle physics.\n", "  We perform ab-initio Quantum Monte Carlo simulations of para-hydrogen\n(pH$_2$) at $T=0$ K confined in carbon nanotubes (CNT) of different radii. The\nradial density profiles show a strong layering of the pH$_2$ molecules which\ngrow, with increasing number of molecules, in solid concentric cylindrical\nshells and eventually a central column. The central column can be considered an\neffective one-dimensional (1D) fluid whose properties are well captured by the\nTomonaga-Luttinger liquid theory. The Luttinger parameter is explicitly\ncomputed and interestingly it shows a non-monotonic behavior with the linear\ndensity similar to what found for pure 1D $^3$He. Remarkably, for the central\ncolumn in a (10,10) CNT, we found an ample linear density range in which the\nLuttinger liquid is (i) superfluid and (ii) stable against a weak disordered\nexternal potential, as the one expected inside realistic pores. This superfluid\nbehavior could be experimentally revealed in bundles of carbon nanotubes, where\ndeviations from classical inertial values associated with superfluid density\ncould be measured via torsional oscillator techniques. In summary, our results\nsuggest that pH$_2$ within carbon nanopores could be a practical realization of\nthe long sought-after, elusive superfluid phase of parahydrogen.\n", "  I discuss the role of quantum effects in the phenomenology of effective\nsupergravity theories from compactification of the weakly coupled heterotic\nstring. An accurate incorporation of these effects requires a regularization\nprocedure that respects local supersymmetry and BRST invariance and that\nretains information associated with the cut-off scale, which has physical\nmeaning in an effective theory. I briefly outline the Pauli-Villars\nregularization procedure, describe some applications, and comment on what\nremains to be done to fully define the effective quantum field theory.\n", "  A quantitative understanding of neutrino-nucleus interactions is demanded to\nachieve precise measurement of neutrino oscillations, and hence the\ndetermination of their masses. In addition, next generation detectors will be\nable to detect supernovae neutrinos, which are likely to shed some light on the\nopen questions on the dynamics of core collapse. In this context, it is crucial\nto account for two-body meson-exchange currents along within realistic models\nof nuclear dynamics. We summarize our progresses towards the construction of a\nconsistent framework, based on the Green's function Monte Carlo method, that\ncan be exploited to accurately describe neutrino interactions with atomic\nnuclei in the quasi-elastic sector.\n", "  In this paper, we investigate the possibility to excite Bloch surface waves\n(BSWs) on the tip of single-mode optical fibers. Within this framework, after\nexploring an idealized, proof-of-principle grating-coupling-based scheme for\non-tip excitation of BSWs, we focus on an alternative configuration that is\nmore robust with respect to fabrication-related non-idealities. Subsequently,\nwith a view towards label-free chemical and biological sensing, we present a\nspecific design aimed at enhancing the sensitivity (in terms of wavelength\nshift) of the arising resonance with respect to changes in the refractive\nproperties of the surrounding environment. Numerical results indicate that the\nattained sensitivities are in line with those exhibited by state-of-the-art\nplasmonic bioprobes, with the key advantage of exhibiting much narrower\nspectral resonances. This prototype study paves the way for a new class of\nminiaturized high-performance surface-wave fiber-optic devices for\nhigh-resolution label-free optical biosensing, and represents an important step\nforward in the \"lab-on-fiber\" technology roadmap.\n", "  Collective flows of protons and $\\pi^{-}$-mesons are studied at the momenta\nof 4.2, 4.5 and 10 AGeV/c for p(C, Ta) and He(Li, C) interactions. The data\nwere obtained from the streamer chamber (SKM-200-GIBS) and from the Propane\nBubble Chamber (PBC-500) systems utilized at JINR. The method of Danielewicz\nand Odyniec has been employed in determining the directed transverse flow of\nparticles. The values of the transverse flow parameter and the strength of the\nanisotropic emission were defined for each interacting nuclear pair. It is\nfound that the directed flows of protons and pions decrease with increase of\nthe energy and the mass numbers of colliding nucleus pairs. The $\\pi^{-}$-meson\nand proton flows exhibit opposite directions in all studied interactions, and\nthe flows of protons are directed in the reaction plane. The Ultra-relativistic\nQuantum Molecular Dynamical Model (UrQMD), enlarged by the Statistical\nMulti-fragmentation Model (SMM), satisfactorily describes obtained experimental\nresults.\n", "  We introduce aspects of physics beyond the Standard Model focusing on\nsupersymmetry, extra dimensions, and a composite Higgs as solutions to the\nHierarchy problem. Lectures at the European School of High Energy Physics,\nPar\\'adf\\\"urd\\H{o}, Hungary, 5-18 June 2013.\n", "  In this paper we substantiate the claim implicitly made in previous works\nthat the relaxed micromorphic model is the only linear, isotropic, reversibly\nelastic, nonlocal generalized continuum model able to describe complete\nband-gaps on a phenomenological level. To this end, we recapitulate the\nresponse of the standard Mindlin-Eringen micromorphic model with the full\nmicro-distortion gradient of P, the relaxed micromorphic model depending only\non the Curl P of the micro-distortion P, and a variant of the standard\nmicromorphic model in which the curvature depends only on the divergence Div P\nof the micro distortion. The Div-model has size-effects but the dispersion\nanalysis for plane waves shows the incapability of that model to even produce a\npartial band gap. Combining the curvature to depend quadratically on Div P and\nCurl P shows that such a model is similar to the standard Mindlin-Eringen model\nwhich can eventually show only a partial band gap.\n", "  YBa$_{2}$Cu$_{3}$O$_{7-{\\delta}}$ coated conductors (CCs) have achieved high\ncritical current densities ($\\textit{J}_{c}$) that can be further increased\nthrough the introduction of additional defects using particle irradiation.\nHowever, these gains are accompanied by increases in the flux creep rate, a\nmanifestation of competition between the different types of defects. Here, we\nstudy this competition to better understand how to design pinning landscapes\nthat simultaneously increase $\\textit{J}_{c}$ and reduce creep. CCs grown by\nmetal organic deposition show non-monotonic changes in the\ntemperature-dependent creep rate, $\\textit{S}(\\textit{T})$. Notably, in low\nfields, there is a conspicuous dip to low $\\textit{S}$ as temperature\n($\\textit{T}$) increases from ~20 K to ~65 K. Oxygen-, proton-, and\nAu-irradiation substantially increase $\\textit{S}$ in this temperature range.\nFocusing on an oxygen-irradiated CC, we investigate the contribution of\ndifferent types of irradiation-induced defects to the flux creep rate.\nSpecifically, we study $\\textit{S}(\\textit{T})$ as we tune the relative density\nof point defects to larger defects by annealing both an as-grown and an\nirradiated CC in O$_{2}$ at temperatures $\\textit{T}_{A}$ = 250${\\deg}$C to\n600${\\deg}$C. We observe a steady decrease in $\\textit{S}$($\\textit{T}$ > 20 K)\nwith increasing $\\textit{T}_{A}$, unveiling the role of pre-existing\nnanoparticle precipitates in creating the dip in $\\textit{S}(\\textit{T})$ and\npoint defects and clusters in increasing $\\textit{S}$ at intermediate\ntemperatures.\n", "  We elaborate on how to build, in a systematic fashion, two-field Abelian\nextensions of the Born-Infeld Lagrangian. These models realize the non-trivial\nduality groups that are allowed in this case, namely U(2), SU(2) and U(1)xU(1).\nFor each class, we also construct an explicit example. They all involve an\noverall square root and reduce to the Born-Infeld model if the two fields are\nidentified, but differ in quartic and higher interactions. The U(1)xU(1) and\nSU(2) examples recover some recent results obtained with different techniques,\nand we show that the U(1)xU(1) model admits an N=1 supersymmetric completion.\nThe U(2) example includes some unusual terms that are not analytic at the\norigin of field space.\n", "  This work will incorporate a few related tools for addressing the conceptual\ndifficulties arising from sewing together classical and quantum mechanics:\ndeterministic operators, weak measurements and post-selection. Weak\nMeasurement, based on a very weak von Neumann coupling, is a unique kind of\nquantum measurement with numerous theoretical and practical applications. In\ncontrast to other measurement techniques, it allows to gather a small amount of\ninformation regarding the quantum system, with only a negligible probability of\ncollapsing it. A single weak measurement yields an almost random outcome, but\nwhen performed repeatedly over a large ensemble, the averaged outcome becomes\nincreasingly robust and accurate. Importantly, a long sequence of weak\nmeasurements can be thought of as a single projective measurement. I claim in\nthis work that classical variables appearing in the macro-world, such as centre\nof mass, moment of inertia, pressure and average forces, result from a\nmultitude of quantum weak measurements performed in the micro-world. Here\nagain, the quantum outcomes are highly uncertain, but the law of large numbers\nobliges their convergence to the definite quantities we know from our everyday\nlives. By augmenting this description with a final boundary condition and\nemploying the notion of \"classical robustness under time-reversal\" I will draw\na quantitative borderline between the classical and quantum regimes. I will\nconclude by analyzing the role of macroscopic systems in amplifying and\nrecording quantum outcomes.\n", "  Neutrino-induced pion production constitutes an important contribution to\nneutrino-nucleus scattering cross sections at intermediate energies. A deep\nunderstanding of this process is mandatory for a correct interpretation of\nneutrino-oscillation experiments. We aim at contributing to the ongoing effort\nto understand the various experimental results obtained by different\ncollaborations in a wide range of energies. In particular, in this work we\nanalyze recent MiniBooNE and MINERvA charged-current neutrino 1-pion production\ndata. We use a relativistic theoretical approach which accounts for resonant\nand non-resonant 1-pion production contributions.\n", "  We investigate the feasibility of CMOS-compatible optical structures to\ndevelop novel integrated spectroscopy systems. We show that local field\nenhancement is achievable utilizing dimers of plasmonic nanospheres that can be\nassembled from colloidal solutions on top of a CMOS-compatible optical\nwaveguide. The resonant dimer nanoantennas are excited by modes guided in the\nintegrated silicon nitride waveguide. Simulations show that 100 fold electric\nfield enhancement builds up in the dimer gap as compared to the waveguide\nevanescent field amplitude at the same location. We investigate how the field\nenhancement depends on dimer location, orientation, distance and excited\nwaveguide modes.\n", "  Some of the recent progress in the physics of pion production induced by\nneutrinos on nucleons and nuclei is reviewed from a theoretical perspective.\nThe importance of Watson's theorem to reconcile ANL and BNL data with the\noff-diagonal Goldberger-Treiman relation for the $\\Delta(1232)$ is discussed.\nThe disagreement between MiniBooNE data and theoretical calculations is\npresented in the light of the new MINERvA data. The coherent pion production\ndata on $^{12}$C obtained by MINERvA are also compared to different microscopic\nand PCAC models.\n", "  We study the Resonant Relaxation (RR) of an axisymmetric low mass (or\nKeplerian) stellar disc orbiting a more massive black hole (MBH). Our recent\nwork on the general kinetic theory of RR is simplified in the standard manner\nby ignoring the effects of `gravitational polarization', and applied to a\nzero-thickness, flat, axisymmetric disc. The wake of a stellar orbit is\nexpressed in terms of the angular momenta exchanged with other orbits, and used\nto derive a kinetic equation for RR under the combined actions of self-gravity,\n1 PN and 1.5 PN relativistic effects of the MBH and an arbitrary external\naxisymmetric potential. This is a Fokker-Planck equation for the stellar\ndistribution function (DF), wherein the diffusion coefficients are given\nself-consistently in terms of contributions from apsidal resonances between\npairs of stellar orbits. The physical kinetics is studied for the two main\ncases of interest. (1) `Lossless' discs in which the MBH is not a sink of\nstars, and disc mass, angular momentum and energy are conserved: we prove that\ngeneral H-functions can increase or decrease during RR, but the Boltzmann\nentropy is (essentially) unique in being a non-decreasing function of time.\nTherefore secular thermal equilibria are maximum entropy states, with DFs of\nthe Boltzmann form; the two-Ring correlation function at equilibrium is\ncomputed. (2) Discs that lose stars to the MBH through an `empty loss-cone': we\nderive expressions for the MBH feeding rates of mass, angular momentum and\nenergy in terms of the diffusive flux at the loss-cone boundary.\n", "  We have studied nuclear structure functions $F_{1A}(x,Q^2)$ and\n$F_{2A}(x,Q^2)$ for electromagnetic and weak processes in the region of $1\nGeV^2 < Q^2 <8 GeV^2$. The nuclear medium effects arising due to Fermi motion,\nbinding energy, nucleon correlations, mesonic contributions and shadowing\neffects are taken into account using a many body field theoretical approach.\nThe calculations are performed in a local density approximation using a\nrelativistic nucleon spectral function. The results are compared with the\navailable experimental data. Implications of nuclear medium effects on the\nvalidity of Callan-Gross relation are also discussed.\n", "  We present the results of charged current quasielastic(CCQE) scattering cross\nsections from free as well as bound nucleons like in $^{12}C$, $^{16}O$,\n$^{40}Ar$ and $^{208}Pb$ nuclear targets in $E_\\nu(_{\\bar\\nu})~\\le~ $1 GeV\nenergy region.\n  The results are obtained using local Fermi gas model with and without RPA\neffect.\n  The differences those may arise in the electron and muon production cross\nsections due to the different lepton mass, uncertainties in the axial dipole\nmass $M_A$ and pseudoscalar form factor, and due to the inclusion of second\nclass currents have been highlighted for neutrino/antineutrino induced\nprocesses.\n", "  We have studied charged current neutrino/antineutrino induced weak pion\nproduction from nucleon. For the present study, contributions from\n$\\Delta(1232)$-resonant term, non-resonant background terms as well as\ncontribution from higher resonances viz. $P_{11}$(1440), $D_{13}$(1520),\n$S_{11}$(1535), $S_{11}$(1650) and $P_{13}$(1720) are taken. To write the\nhadronic current for the non-resonant background terms, a microscopic approach\nbased on SU(2) non-linear sigma model has been used. The vector form factors\nfor the resonances are obtained from the helicity amplitudes provided by MAID.\nAxial coupling in the case of $\\Delta(1232)$ resonance is obtained by fitting\nthe ANL and BNL $\\nu$-deuteron reanalyzed scattering data. The results of the\ncross sections are presented and discussed for all the possible channels of\nsingle pion production induced by charged current interaction.\n", "  In this work, we study the influence of nuclear medium effects on various\nparton model sum rules in nuclei and compare the results with the free nucleon\ncase. We have used relativistic nucleon spectral function to take into account\nFermi motion, binding and nucleon correlations. The pion and rho meson cloud\ncontributions have been incorporated in a microscopic model. The effect of\nshadowing has also been considered.\n", "  In this work we consider a family of cosmological models featuring future\nsingularities. This type of cosmological evolution is typical of dark energy\nmodels with an equation of state violating some of the standard energy\nconditions (e.g. the null energy condition). Such kind of behavior, widely\nstudied in the literature, may arise in cosmologies with phantom fields,\ntheories of modified gravity or models with interacting dark matter/dark\nenergy. We briefly review the physical consequences of these cosmological\nevolution regarding geodesic completeness and the divergence of tidal forces in\norder to emphasize under which circumstances the singularities in some\ncosmological quantities correspond to actual singular spacetimes. We then\nintroduce several phenomenological parameterizations of the Hubble expansion\nrate to model different singularities existing in the literature and use SN Ia,\nBAO and H(z) data to constrain how far in the future the singularity needs to\nbe (under some reasonable assumptions on the behaviour of the Hubble factor).\nWe show that, for our family of parameterizations, the lower bound for the\nsingularity time can not be smaller than about 1.2 times the age of the\nuniverse, what roughly speaking means about 2.8 Gyrs from the present time.\n", "  We give a status report on the automation of next-to-leading order processes\nwithin the Monte Carlo event generator WHIZARD, using GoSam and OpenLoops as\nprovider for one-loop matrix elements. To deal with divergences, WHIZARD uses\nautomated FKS subtraction, and the phase space for singular regions is\ngenerated automatically. NLO examples for both scattering and decay processes\nwith a focus on e+e- processes are shown. Also, first NLO-studies of\nobservables for collisions of polarized leptons beams, e.g. at the ILC, will be\npresented. Furthermore, the automatic matching of the fixed-order NLO\namplitudes with emissions from the parton shower within the POWHEG formalism\ninside WHIZARD will be discussed. We also present results for top pairs at\nthreshold in lepton collisions, including matching between a resummed threshold\ncalculation and fixed-order NLO. This allows the investigation of more\nexclusive differential observables.\n", "  We present a Monte Carlo truth study examining nuclear effects in\ncharged-current neutrino interactions using observables constructed in the\ntransverse plane. Three distributions are introduced that show very weak\ndependence on neutrino flux and its associated uncertainty. Measurements\ncomparing these distributions between quasi-elastic-like and single charged\npion final states will provide new constraints of nuclear effects. It is\nsuggested that the on-axis position in the NuMI beam provides the correct flux\nto take advantage of this reduced energy dependence in measuring nuclear\neffect-generated transverse imbalances.\n", "  In this paper is studied ferromagnetic three states Potts model on a Cayley\ntree of order three and we give explicit formulas for translation-invariant\nGibbs measures. Furthermore, we show that under some conditions on the\nparameter of the antiferromagnetic Potts model with q-states with zero external\nfield on the Cayley tree of order $k>2$, there are exactly 2(2^q-1) periodic\n(non translation-invariant) Gibbs measures.\n", "  We study the scaling asymptotics of the eigenspace projection kernels\n$\\Pi_{\\hbar, E}(x,y)$ of the isotropic Harmonic Oscillator $- \\hbar ^2 \\Delta +\n|x|^2$ of eigenvalue $E = \\hbar(N + \\frac{d}{2})$ in the semi-classical limit\n$\\hbar \\to 0$. The principal result is an explicit formula for the scaling\nasymptotics of $\\Pi_{\\hbar, E}(x,y)$ for $x,y$ in a $\\hbar^{2/3}$ neighborhood\nof the caustic $\\mathcal C_E$ as $\\hbar \\to 0.$ The scaling asymptotics are\napplied to the distribution of nodal sets of Gaussian random eigenfunctions\naround the caustic as $\\hbar \\to 0$. In previous work we proved that the\ndensity of zeros of Gaussian random eigenfunctions of $\\hat{H}_{\\hbar}$ have\ndifferent orders in the Planck constant $\\hbar$ in the allowed and forbidden\nregions: In the allowed region the density is of order $\\hbar^{-1}$ while it is\n$\\hbar^{-1/2}$ in the forbidden region. Our main result on nodal sets is that\nthe density of zeros is of order $\\hbar^{-\\frac{2}{3}}$ in an\n$\\hbar^{\\frac{2}{3}}$-tube around the caustic. This tube radius is the\n`critical radius'. For annuli of larger inner and outer radii $\\hbar^{\\alpha}$\nwith $0< \\alpha < \\frac{2}{3}$ we obtain density results which interpolate\nbetween this critical radius result and our prior ones in the allowed and\nforbidden region. We also show that the Hausdorff $(d-2)$-dimensional measure\nof the intersection of the nodal set with the caustic is of order $\\hbar^{-\n\\frac{2}{3}}$.\n", "  A combined nonequilibrium Green functions-Ehrenfest dynamics approach is\ndeveloped that allows for a time-dependent study of the energy loss of a\ncharged particle penetrating a strongly correlated system at zero and finite\ntemperature. Numerical results are presented for finite inhomogeneous\ntwo-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard models, where the many-electron dynamics in the\ntarget are treated fully quantum mechanically and the motion of the projectile\nis treated classically. The simulations are based on the solution of the\ntwo-time Dyson (Keldysh-Kadanoff-Baym) equations using the second-order Born,\nthird-order and T-matrix approximations of the self-energy. As application, we\nconsider protons and helium nuclei with a kinetic energy between 1 and 500\nkeV/u passing through planar fragments of the two-dimensional honeycomb lattice\nand, in particular, examine the influence of electron-electron correlations on\nthe energy exchange between projectile and electron system. We investigate the\ntime dependence of the projectile's kinetic energy (stopping power), the\nelectron density, the double occupancy and the photoemission spectrum. Finally,\nwe show that, for a suitable choice of the Hubbard model parameters, the\nresults for the stopping power are in fair agreement with ab-initio simulations\nfor particle irradiation of single-layer graphene.\n", "  Opening Lecture at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology Jockey\nClub Institute for Advanced Study Program on High Energy Physics Conference,\nJanuary 18--21, 2016.\n", "  We study by molecular dynamics simulations the thermodynamics of an anomalous\nfluid confined in a slit pore with one wall structured and attractive and\nanother unstructured and repulsive. We find that the phase diagram of the\nhomogeneous part of the confined fluid is shifted to higher temperatures,\ndensities and pressures with respect to the bulk, but it can be rescaled on the\nbulk case. We calculate a moderate increase of mobility of the homogeneous\nconfined fluid that we interpret as a consequence of the layering due to\nconfinement and the collective modes due to long-range correlations. We show\nthat, as in bulk, the confined fluid has structural, diffusion and density\nanomalies, that order in the water-like hierarchy, and a liquid-liquid critical\npoint (LLCP). The overall anomalous region moves to higher temperatures,\ndensities and pressure and the LLCP displaces to higher temperature compared to\nbulk. Motivated by experiments, we calculate also the phase diagram not just\nfor the homogeneous part of the confined fluid but for the entire fluid in the\npore and show that it is shifted towards higher pressures but preserves the\nthermodynamics, including the LLCP. Because our model has water-like\nproperties, we argue that in experiments with supercooled water confined in\nslit pores with a width of > 3 nm if hydrophilic, and of > 1.5 nm if\nhydrophobic, the existence of the LLCP could be easier to test than in bulk,\nwhere it is not directly accessible.\n", "  Assuming that primordial density fluctuationas are nearly Gaussian, from a\nfrequentist viewpoint, the two-dimensional marginalized joint coincidence\ncontour in the plane $(n_s,r)$ (being $n_s$ the spectral index and $r$ the\nratio of tensor to scalar perturbations), without the presence of running is\nusually used to test the viability of the inflationary models. The models that\nprovide, between $50$ and $60$ e-folds, a curve in that plane, which lies\noutside the $95.5 \\%$ C.L are ruled out. I will basically argue that the this\nlow number of e-folds is unjustified, and that models leading to a theoretical\nvalue of the running different from zero must be checked with observational\ndata allowing the running. When both prescriptions are taken into account,\ndealing in the context of quintessential inflation, i.e. when the potential is\na combination of an inflationary with a quintessential one that leads to a\ndeflationary regime, inflationary models such as the quartic or the Higgs\npotential are allowed.\n", "  The CMS experiment at the LHC accelerator at CERN relies on its computing\ninfrastructure to stay at the frontier of High Energy Physics, searching for\nnew phenomena and making discoveries. Even though computing plays a significant\nrole in physics analysis we rarely use its data to predict the system behavior\nitself. A basic information about computing resources, user activities and site\nutilization can be really useful for improving the throughput of the system and\nits management. In this paper, we discuss a first CMS analysis of dataset\npopularity based on CMS meta-data which can be used as a model for dynamic data\nplacement and provide the foundation of data-driven approach for the CMS\ncomputing infrastructure.\n", "  State-of-the-art algorithms generate scattering amplitudes for high-energy\nphysics at leading order for high-multiplicity processes as compiled code (in\nFortran, C or C++). For complicated processes the size of these libraries can\nbecome tremendous (many GiB). We show that amplitudes can be translated to\nbyte-code instructions, which even reduce the size by one order of magnitude.\nThe byte-code is interpreted by a Virtual Machine with runtimes comparable to\ncompiled code and a better scaling with additional legs. We study the\nproperties of this algorithm, as an extension of the Optimizing Matrix Element\nGenerator (O'Mega). The bytecode matrix elements are available as alternative\ninput for the event generator WHIZARD. The bytecode interpreter can be\nimplemented very compactly, which will help with a future implementation on\nmassively parallel GPUs.\n", "  We measure the frequencies of spin waves in nm-thick perpendicularly\nmagnetized FeCoB systems, and model the frequencies to deduce the exchange\nstiffness of this material in the ultrathin limit. For this, we embody the\nlayers in magnetic tunnel junctions patterned into circular nanopillars of\ndiameters ranging from 100 to 300 nm and we use magneto-resistance to determine\nwhich rf-current frequencies are efficient in populating the spin wave modes.\nMicromagnetic calculations indicate that the ultrathin nature of the layer and\nthe large wave vectors used ensure that the spin wave frequencies are\npredominantly determined by the exchange stiffness, such that the number of\nmodes in a given frequency window can be used to estimate the exchange. For 1\nnm layers the experimental data are consistent with an exchange stiffness A= 20\npJ/m, which is slightly lower that its bulk counterpart. The thickness\ndependence of the exchange stiffness has strong implications for the numerous\nsituations that involve ultrathin films hosting strong magnetization gradients,\nand the micromagnetic description thereof.\n", "  Recently, the switching between the different charge-ordered phases of\n1T-TaS2 has been probed by ultrafast techniques, revealing unexpected phenomena\nsuch as \"hidden\" metastable states and peculiar photoexcited charge patterns.\nHere, we apply broadband pump-probe spectroscopy with varying excitation energy\nto study the ultrafast optical properties of 1T-TaS2 in the visible regime. By\nscanning the excitation energy in the near-IR region we unravel the coupling\nbetween different charge excitations and the low-lying charge-density wave\nstate. We find that the amplitude mode of the charge-density wave exhibits\nstrong coupling to a long-lived doublon state that is photoinduced in the\ncenter of the star-shaped charge-ordered Ta clusters by the near-IR optical\nexcitation.\n", "  In this report we discuss static and time dependent electric fields in\ndetector geometries with an arbitrary number of parallel layers of a given\npermittivity and weak conductivity. We derive the Green's functions i.e. the\nfield of a point charge, as well as the weighting fields for readout pads and\nreadout strips in these geometries. The effect of 'bulk' resistivity on\nelectric fields and signals is investigated. The spreading of charge on thin\nresistive layers is also discussed in detail, and the conditions for allowing\nthe effect to be described by the diffusion equation is discussed. We apply the\nresults to derive fields and induced signals in Resistive Plate Chambers,\nMicromega detectors including resistive layers for charge spreading and\ndischarge protection as well as detectors using resistive charge division\nreadout like the MicroCAT detector. We also discuss in detail how resistive\nlayers affect signal shapes and increase crosstalk between readout electrodes.\n", "  We study the effect of localized magnetic moments on the conductance of a\nhelical edge. Interaction with a local moment is an effective backscattering\nmechanism for the edge electrons. We evaluate the resulting differential\nconductance as a function of temperature $T$ and applied bias $V$ for any value\nof $V/T$. Backscattering off magnetic moments, combined with the weak repulsion\nbetween the edge electrons results in a power-law temperature and voltage\ndependence of the conductance; the corresponding small positive exponent is\nindicative of insulating behavior. Local moments may naturally appear due to\ncharge disorder in a narrow-gap semiconductor. Our results provide an\nalternative interpretation of the recent experiment by Li et al. \\cite{Li15}\nwhere a power-law suppression of the conductance was attributed to strong\nelectron repulsion within the edge, with the value of Luttinger liquid\nparameter $K$ fine-tuned close to $1/4$.\n", "  Preconjugate variables X have commutation relations with the energy-momentum\nP of the respective system which are of a more general form than just the\nHamiltonian one. Since they have been proven useful in their own right for\nfinding new spacetimes we present here a study of them. Interesting examples\ncan be found via geometry: motions on the mass-shell for massive and massless\nsystems, and via group theory: invariance under special conformal\ntransformations of mass-shell, resp. light-cone -- both find representations on\nFock space. We work mainly in ordinary fourdimensional Minkowski space and spin\nzero. The limit process from non-zero to vanishing mass turns out to be\nnon-trivial and leads naturally to wedge variables. We point out some\napplications and extension to more general spacetimes. In a companion paper we\ndiscuss the transition to conjugate pairs.\n", "  We propose a simple linear scaling expression in reciprocal space for\nevaluating the ion--electron potential of crystalline solids. The expression\nreplaces the long-range ion--electron potential with an equivalent localized\ncharge distribution and corresponding boundary conditions on the unit cell.\nGiven that no quadratic scaling structure factor is required---as used in\ntraditional methods---the expression shows inherent linear behavior, and is\nwell suited to simulating large-scale systems within orbital-free density\nfunctional theory. The scheme is implemented in the ATLAS software package and\nbenchmarked by using a solid Mg bcc lattice containing tens of thousands of\natoms in the unit cell. The test results show that the method can efficiently\nmodel large crystals with high computational accuracy.\n", "  We clarify the significance of quasiprobability (QP) in quantum mechanics\nthat is relevant in describing physical quantities associated with a transition\nprocess. Our basic quantity is Aharonov's weak value, from which the QP can be\ndefined up to a certain ambiguity parameterized by a complex number. Unlike the\nconventional probability, the QP allows us to treat two noncommuting\nobservables consistently, and this is utilized to embed the QP in Bohmian\nmechanics such that its equivalence to quantum mechanics becomes more\ntransparent. We also show that, with the help of the QP, Bohmian mechanics can\nbe recognized as an ontological model with a certain type of contextuality.\n", "  The energy spectrum of the 2D cavity magnetoexciton-polaritons has been\ninvestigated previously, using exact solutions for the Landau quantization of\nconduction electrons and heavy holes provided by the Rashba method [1]. Two\nlowest Landau quantization levels for electrons and three lowest Landau levels\nfor heavy-holes, lead to the construction of the six lowest magnetoexciton\nsates. They consist of two dipole-active, two quadrupole-active, and the two\nforbidden quantum transitions from the ground state of the crystal to the\nmagnetoexciton states. The interaction of the four optical-active\nmagnetoexciton states with the cavity mode photons with a given circular\npolarization and with well-defined incidence direction leads to the creation of\nfive magnetoexciton-polariton branches. The fifth order dispersion equation is\nexamined by using numerical calculations and the second order dispersion\nequation is solved analytically, taking into account only one dipole-active\nmagnetoexciton state. The effective polariton mass on the lower polariton\nbranch, the Rabi frequency and the corresponding Hopfield coefficients are\ndetermined in dependence on the magnetic field strength, the Rashba spin-orbit\ncoupling parameters and the electron and hole g-factors.\n", "  We demonstrate that a nonzero concentration $n_v$ of static, randomly-placed\nvacancies in graphene leads to a density $w$ of zero-energy quasiparticle\nstates at the band-center $\\epsilon=0$ within a tight-binding description with\nnearest-neighbour hopping $t$ on the honeycomb lattice. We show that $w$\nremains generically nonzero in the compensated case (exactly equal number of\nvacancies on the two sublattices) even in the presence of hopping disorder, and\ndepends sensitively on $n_v$ and correlations between vacancy positions. For\nlow, {\\em but not-too-low} $|\\epsilon|/t$ in this compensated case, we show\nthat the density of states (DOS) $\\rho(\\epsilon)$ exhibits a strong divergence\nof the form $\\rho_{\\rm 1D}(\\epsilon) \\sim |\\epsilon|^{-1}/\n[\\log(t/|\\epsilon|)]^{(y+1)} $, which crosses over to the universal low-energy\nasymptotic form expected on symmetry grounds $\\rho_{\\rm GW}(\\epsilon) \\sim\n|\\epsilon|^{-1}e^{-b[\\log(t/|\\epsilon|)]^{2/3} }$ below a crossover scale\n$\\epsilon_c \\ll t$. $\\epsilon_c$ is found to decrease rapidly with decreasing\n$n_v$, while $y$ decreases much more slowly.\n", "  In this paper, we revisit the issue intensively studied in recent years on\nthe generation of terms by radiative corrections in models with broken Lorentz\nsymmetry. The algebraic perturbative method of handling the problem of\nrenormalization of the theories with Lorentz symmetry breaking, is used. We\nhope to make clear the Symanzik's aphorism: \"{\\it Whether you like it or not,\nyou have to include in the lagrangian all counter terms consistent with\nlocality and power-counting, unless otherwise constrained by Ward identities.}\"\n", "  In this talk, we discuss recent progress in the application of\ngeneralizations of polylogarithms in the symbolic computation of multi-loop\nintegrals. We briefly review the Maple program MPL which supports a certain\napproach for the computation of Feynman integrals in terms of multiple\npolylogarithms. Furthermore we discuss elliptic generalizations of\npolylogarithms which have shown to be useful in the computation of the massive\ntwo-loop sunrise integral.\n", "  We analyze the temporal response of the fluorescence light that is emitted\nfrom a dense gas of cold atoms driven by a laser. When the average interatomic\ndistance is smaller than the wavelength of the photons scattered by the atoms,\nthe system exhibits strong dipolar interactions and collective dissipation. We\nsolve the exact dynamics of small systems with different geometries and show\nhow these collective features are manifest in the scattered light properties\nsuch as the photon emission rate, the power spectrum and the second-order\ncorrelation function. By calculating these quantities beyond the weak driving\nlimit, we make progress in understanding the signatures of collective behavior\nin these many-body systems. Furthermore, we clarify the role of disorder on the\nresonance fluorescence, of direct relevance for recent experimental efforts\nthat aim at the exploration of many-body effects in dipole-dipole interacting\ngases of atoms.\n", "  Dopants of transition metal ions in II-VI semiconductors exhibit native 2+\nvalency. Despite this, 3+ or mixed 3+/2+ valency of iron ions in ZnO was\nreported previously. Several contradictory mechanisms have been put forward for\nexplanation of this fact so far. Here, we analyze Fe valency in ZnO by\ncomplementary theoretical and experimental studies. Our calculations within the\ngeneralized gradient approximation (GGA+U) indicate that the Fe ion is a\nrelatively shallow donor. Its stable charge state is Fe2+ in ideal ZnO,\nhowever, the high energy of the (+/0) transition level enhances the\ncompensation of Fe2+ to Fe3+ by non-intentional acceptors in real samples.\nUsing several experimental methods like electron paramagnetic resonance,\nmagnetometry, conductivity, excitonic magnetic circular dichroism and\nmagneto-photoluminescence we confirm the 3+ valency of the iron ions in\npolycrystalline (Zn,Fe)O films with the Fe content attaining 0.2%.We find a\npredicted increase of n-type conductivity upon the Fe doping with the Fe donor\nionization energy of 0.25 +/- 0.02 eV consistent with the results of\ntheoretical considerations. Moreover, our magnetooptical measurements confirm\nthe calculated non-vanishing s,p-d exchange interaction between band carriers\nand localized magnetic moments of the Fe3+ ions in the ZnO, being so far an\nunsettled issue.\n", "  A theoretical model, which relates the binding energy of a positively charged\nexciton in a quantum dot with the confinement energy is presented. It is shown\nthat the binding energy, defined as the energy difference between the\ncorresponding charged and neutral complexes confined on the same excitonic\nshell strongly depends on the shell index. Moreover, it is shown that the ratio\nof the binding energy for positively charged excitons from the $p$- and\n$s$-shells of a dot depends mainly on the nearly perfect confinement in the\ndot, which is due to the \"hidden symmetry\" of the multi-electron-hole system.\nWe applied the theory to the excitons confined to a single GaAlAs/AlAs quantum\ndots. The relevant binding energy was determined using the\nmicro-photoluminescence and micro-photoluminescence excitation\nmagneto-spectroscopy. We show that within our theory, the confinement energy\ndetermined using the ratio of the binding energy corresponds well to the actual\nconfinement energy of the investigated dot.\n", "  We show that the stationary decoherence rate of an open quantum system can be\ndecomposed as a sum of local and nonlocal contributions, respectively related\nto the strength of the coupling between system and environment, and to the\nquality of the information about the system leaking into the environment. Both\nterms arise naturally in the framework of the influence functional, with the\nnonlocal term arising from the coupling between the backward and forward\nhistories describing the open quantum system time evolution. While the local\ncontribution always yields a positive decoherence rate, the nonlocal one may\nlead to recoherence when only partial information about the system is obtained\nfrom the disturbed environment. We illustrate these concepts in the framework\nof interferometry with trapped atoms, by analyzing the effect of spontaneous\nemission on the coherence of the center-of-mass.\n", "  A great deal of research work has been undertaken in alpha-clustering study\nsince the pioneering discovery of 12C+12C molecular resonances half a century\nago. Our knowledge on physics of nuclear molecules has increased considerably\nand nuclear clustering remains one of the most fruitful domains of nuclear\nphysics, facing some of the greatest challenges and opportunities in the years\nahead. The occurrence of \"exotic\" shapes in light N=Z alpha-like nuclei is\ninvestigated. Various approaches of the superdeformed and hyperdeformed bands\nassociated with quasimolecular resonant structures are presented. Evolution of\nclustering from stability to the drip-lines is examined: clustering aspects\nare, in particular, discussed for light exotic nuclei with large neutron excess\nsuch as neutron-rich Oxygen isotopes with their complete spectroscopy.\n", "  In this paper, we propose a new procedure to deform spectral triples and\ntheir quantum isometry groups. The deformation data are a spectral triple\n$(\\mathcal A,\\mathcal H, D)$, a compact quantum group $\\mathbb G$ acting\nalgebraically and by orientation-preserving isometries on $(\\mathcal A,\\mathcal\nH,D)$ and a unitary fiber functor $\\psi$ on $\\mathbb G$. The deformation\nprocedure is a genuine generalization of the cocycle deformation of Goswami and\nJoardar.\n", "  The article outlines the recent developments in the theoretical and\ncomputational approaches to the higher-order electroweak effects needed for the\naccurate interpretation of MOLLER and Belle II experimental data, and shows how\nnew-physics particles enter at the one-loop level. By analyzing the effects of\n$Z'$-boson on the polarization asymmetry, we show how this hypothetical\ninteraction carrier may influence the future experimental results.\n", "  We discuss the hydrodynamic approach to the study of the time evolution\n-induced by a quench- of local excitations in one dimension. We focus on\ninteraction quenches: the considered protocol consists in creating a stable\nlocalized excitation propagating through the system, and then operating a\nsudden change of the interaction between the particles. To highlight the effect\nof the quench, we take the initial excitation to be a soliton. The quench\nsplits the excitation into two packets moving in opposite directions, whose\ncharacteristics can be expressed in a universal way. Our treatment allows to\ndescribe the internal dynamics of these two packets in terms of the different\nvelocities of their components. We confirm our analytical predictions through\nnumerical simulations performed with the Gross-Pitaevskii equation and with the\nCalogero model (as an example of long range interactions and solvable with a\nparabolic confinement). Through the Calogero model we also discuss the effect\nof an external trapping on the protocol. The hydrodynamic approach shows that\nthere is a difference between the bulk velocities of the propagating packets\nand the velocities of their peaks: it is possible to discriminate the two\nquantities, as we show through the comparison between numerical simulations and\nanalytical estimates. In the realizations of the discussed quench protocol in a\ncold atom experiment, these different velocities are accessible through\ndifferent measurement procedures.\n", "  Even though the Standard Model (SM) is weakly coupled at the Fermi scale, a\nnew strong dynamics involving its degrees of freedom may conceivably lurk at\nslightly higher energies, in the multi TeV range. Approximate symmetries\nprovide a structurally robust context where, within the low energy description,\nthe dimensionless SM couplings are weak, while the new strong dynamics\nmanifests itself exclusively through higher-derivative interactions. We present\nan exhaustive classification of such scenarios in the form of effective field\ntheories, paying special attention to new classes of models where the strong\ndynamics involves, along with the Higgs boson, the SM gauge bosons and/or the\nfermions. The IR softness of the new dynamics suppresses its effects at LEP\nenergies, but deviations are in principle detectable at the LHC, even at\nenergies below the threshold for production of new states. Our construction\nprovides the so far unique structurally robust context where to motivate\nseveral searches in Higgs physics, diboson production, or WW scattering, which\nwere so far poorly justified. Perhaps surprisingly, the interplay between weak\ncoupling, strong coupling and derivatives, which is controlled by symmetries,\ncan override the naive expansion in operator dimension, providing instances\nwhere dimension-8 dominates dimension-6, well within the domain of validity of\nthe low energy effective theory. This result reveals the limitations of an\nanalysis that is both ambitiously general and restricted to dimension-6\noperators.\n", "  We study the evolution of a system of M particles in contact with a large\nreservoir of N>>M particles. The reservoir is initially in equilibrium at\ntemperature T=1/\\beta. The evolution of the system and reservoir is described\nvia a suitable Kac-style collision process. We show that for large N, this\nevolution can be effectively described by replacing the reservoir with a\nMaxwellian thermostat at temperature T. This description provides an\napproximation that is uniform in time both in a suitable L^2 norm and in the\nGabetta-Toscani-Wennberg (GTW) distance.\n", "  We analyze the energy spectra of $single$ b-jets and B-hadrons resulting from\nthe production and decay of top quarks within the SM at the LHC at the NLO QCD.\nFor both hadrons and jets, we calculate the correlation of the peak of the\nspectrum with the top quark mass, considering the \"energy-peak\" as an\nobservable to determine the top quark mass. Such a method is motivated by our\nprevious work where we argued that this approach can have reduced sensitivity\nto the details of the production mechanism of the top quark, whether it is\nhigher-order QCD effects or new physics contributions. As part of the NLO\nimprovement over the original proposal, we assess the residual sensitivity of\nthe extracted top quark mass to perturbative effects both in top quark\nproduction and decay. For a 1% jet energy scale uncertainty (and assuming\nnegligible statistical error), the top quark mass can then be extracted using\nthe energy-peak of b-jets with an error +- (1.2 (exp) + 0.6(th)) GeV. We note\nthat recently the CMS collaboration reported a top quark mass measurement based\non the original proposal (with b-jets) so that our result contributes to a\nprecise evaluation of the associated theory uncertainty. In view of the\ndominant jet energy scale uncertainty in the measurement using b-jets, we also\ninvestigate the extraction of the top quark mass from the energy-peak of the\ncorresponding B-hadrons which, in principle, can be measured without this\nuncertainty. The calculation of the B-hadron energy spectrum is carried out\nusing fragmentation functions at NLO. The dependence on the fragmentation scale\nturns out to be the largest theoretical uncertainty in this extraction of top\nquark mass. Future improvement of the treatment of bottom quark hadronization\ncan reduce this uncertainty, rendering methods based on the B-hadron\nenergy-peak competitive for the top quark mass measurement.\n", "  We investigate the resonant quantum dynamics of a multi-qubit ensemble in a\nmicrocavity. Both the quantum-dot subsystem and the microcavity mode are pumped\ncoherently. We found that the microcavity photon statistics depends on the\nphase difference of the driving lasers which is not the case for the photon\nintensity at resonant driving. This way, one can manipulate the two-photon\ncorrelations. In particular, higher degrees of photon correlations and,\neventually, stronger intensities are obtained. Furthermore, the microcavity\nphoton statistics exhibits steady-state oscillatory behaviors as well as\nasymmetries.\n", "  The quantum max-flow min-cut conjecture relates the rank of a tensor network\nto the minimum cut in the case that all tensors in the network are\nidentical\\cite{mfmc1}. This conjecture was shown to be false in Ref.\n\\onlinecite{mfmc2} by an explicit counter-example. Here, we show that the\nconjecture is almost true, in that the ratio of the quantum max-flow to the\nquantum min-cut converges to $1$ as the dimension $N$ of the degrees of freedom\non the edges of the network tends to infinity. The proof is based on estimating\nmoments of the singular values of the network. We introduce a generalization of\n\"rainbow diagrams\"\\cite{rainbow} to tensor networks to estimate the dominant\ndiagrams. A direct comparison of second and fourth moments lower bounds the\nratio of the quantum max-flow to the quantum min-cut by a constant. To show the\ntighter bound that the ratio tends to $1$, we consider higher moments. In\naddition, we show that the limiting moments as $N \\rightarrow \\infty$ agree\nwith that in a different ensemble where tensors in the network are chosen\nindependently, this is used to show that the distributions of singular values\nin the two different ensembles weakly converge to the same limiting\ndistribution. We present also a numerical study of one particular tensor\nnetwork, which shows a surprising dependence of the rank deficit on $N \\mod 4$\nand suggests further conjecture on the limiting behavior of the rank.\n", "  We present a theoretical study of high-order harmonic generation (HHG) driven\nby ultrashort optical pulses with different kind of chirps. The goal of the\npresent work is perform a detailed study to clarify the relevant parameters in\nthe chirped pulses to achieve a noticeable cut-off extensions in HHG. These\nchirped pulses are generated using both linear and nonlinear dispersive\nmedia.The description of the origin of the physical mechanisms responsible of\nthis extension is, however, not usually reported with enough detail in the\nliterature. The study of the behaviour of the harmonic cut-off with these kind\nof pulses is carried out in the classical context, by the integration of the\nNewton-Lorentz equation complemented with the quantum approach, based on the\nintegration of the time dependent Schr\\\"odinger equation in full dimensions\n(TDSE-3D), we are able to understand the underlying physics.\n", "  Rotation curve measurements provided the first strong indication that a\nsignificant fraction of matter in the Universe is non-baryonic. Since then, a\ntremendous amount of progress has been made on both the theoretical and\nexperimental fronts in the search for this missing matter, which we now know\nconstitutes nearly 85% of the Universe's matter density. These series of\nlectures, first given at the TASI 2015 summer school, provide an introduction\nto the basics of dark matter physics. They are geared for the advanced\nundergraduate or graduate student interested in pursuing research in\nhigh-energy physics. The primary goal is to build an understanding of how\nobservations constrain the assumptions that can be made about the astro- and\nparticle physics properties of dark matter. The lectures begin by delineating\nthe basic assumptions that can be inferred about dark matter from rotation\ncurves. A detailed discussion of thermal dark matter follows, motivating Weakly\nInteracting Massive Particles, as well as lighter-mass alternatives. As an\napplication of these concepts, the phenomenology of direct and indirect\ndetection experiments is discussed in detail.\n", "  Lithium - the lightest alkali metal - exhibits unexpected structures and\nelectronic behaviour at high pressures. As the heavier alkalis, Li is bcc at\nambient pressure and transforms first to fcc (at 7.5 GPa). The post-fcc\nhigh-pressure form Li-cI16 (at 40-60 GPa) is similar to Na-cI16 and related to\nmore complex structures of heavy alkalis Rb-oC52 and Cs-oC84. The other high\npressure phases for Li (oC88, oC40, oC24) found at pressures up to 130 GPa are\nspecific the only to Li. The different route of Li high-pressure structures\ncorrelates with its special electronic configuration containing the only 3\nelectrons (at 1s and 2s levels). Crystal structures for Li are analyzed within\nthe model of Fermi sphere - Brillouin zone interactions. Stability of post-fcc\nstructures for Li can be supported by Hume-Rothery arguments when new Brillouin\nzone plains appear close to the Fermi level producing pseudogaps near the Fermi\nlevel and decreasing the crystal energy. The filling of Brillouin-Jones zones\nby electron states for a given structure defines the physical properties as\noptical reflectivity, electrical resistivity and superconductivity. To\nunderstand complexity of structural and physical properties of Li above 60 GPa\nis necessary to assume the valence electrons band overlap with the upper core\nelectrons and increase the valence electron count under compression.\n", "  Nanoscale metal oxide memristors have potential in the development of\nbrain-inspired computing systems that are scalable and efficient1-3. In such\nsystems, memristors represent the native electronic analogues of the biological\nsynapses. However, the characteristics of the existing memristors do not fully\nsupport the key requirements of synaptic connections: high density, adjustable\nweight, and low energy operation. Here we show a bilayer memristor that is\nforming-free, low-voltage (~|0.8V|), energy-efficient (full On/Off switching at\n~2pJ), and reliable. Furthermore, pulse measurements reveal the analog nature\nof the memristive device, that is it can be directly programmed to intermediate\nresistance states. Leveraging this finding, we demonstrate\nspike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), a spike-based Hebbian learning rule4.\nIn those experiments, the memristor exhibits a marked change in the normalized\nsynaptic strength (>30 times) when the pre- and post-synaptic neural spikes\noverlap. This demonstration is an important step towards the physical\nconstruction of high density and high connectivity neural networks.\n", "  A brief review is given of some well-known and some very recent results\nobtained in studies of two- and three-dimensional (2D and 3D) solitons. Both\nzero-vorticity (fundamental) solitons and ones carrying vorticity S = 1 are\nconsidered. Physical realizations of multidimensional solitons in atomic\nBose-Einstein condensates (BECs) and nonlinear optics are briefly discussed\ntoo. Unlike 1D solitons, which are typically stable, 2D and 3D ones are\nvulnerable to instabilities induced by the occurrence of the critical and\nsupercritical collapse, respectively, in the same 2D and 3D models that give\nrise to the solitons. Vortex solitons are subject to a still stronger splitting\ninstability. For this reason, a central problem is search for physical settings\nin which 2D and 3D solitons may be stabilized. The brief review addresses one\nwell-established topic, viz., the stabilization of the 3D and 2D states, with S\n= 0 and 1, trapped in harmonic-oscillator (HO) potentials, and another topic\nwhich was developed very recently: the stabilization of 2D and 3D free-space\nsolitons, which juxtapose components with S = 0 and (+/-)1 (semi-vortices and\nmixed modes), in a binary system with the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) between its\ncomponents. The former model is based on the single cubic nonlinear\nSchroedinger/Gross-Pitaevskii equation (NLSE/GPE), while the latter one is\nrepresented by a system of two coupled GPEs. In both cases, generic situations\nare drastically different in the 2D and 3D geometries. In the 2D settings, the\nstabilization mechanism creates a stable ground state (GS, which was absent\nwithout the stabilization), whose norm falls below the threshold value at which\nthe critical collapse sets in. In the 3D geometry, the supercritical collapse\ndoes not allow to create a GS, but metastable solitons can be constructed.\n", "  Electronic devices made from organic materials have the potential to support\na more ecologically friendly and affordable future. However, the ability to\nfabricate devices with well-defined and reproducible electrical and optical\nproperties is hindered by the sensitivity to the presence of chemical\nimpurities. Oxygen in particular is an impurity that can trap electrons and\nmodify conductive properties of some organic materials. Until now the\n3-dimensional profiling of oxygen species in organic semiconductors has been\nelusive and the effect of oxygen remains disputed. In this study we map out\nhigh-spatial resolution 3-dimensional distributions of oxygen inclusions near\nthe surface of single crystal rubrene, using Time of Flight Secondary Ion Mass\nSpectroscopy (TOF-SIMS). Channels of diffused oxygen, 'oxygen pillars', are\nfound extending from uniform oxygen inclusion layers at the surface. These\npillars extend to depths in excess of 1.8 {\\mu}m and act as an entry point for\noxygen to diffuse along the ab-plane of the crystal with at least some of the\ndiffused oxygen molecularly binding to rubrene. Our investigation of surfaces\nat different stages of evolution reveals the extent of oxygen inclusion, which\naffects rubrene's optical and transport properties, and is consequently of\nimportance for the reliability and longevity of devices.\n", "  We apply a recent result of Borichev-Golinskii-Kupin on the Blaschke-type\nconditions for zeros of analytic functions on the complex plane with a cut\nalong the positive semi-axis to the problem of the eigenvalues distribution of\nthe Fredholm-type analytic operator-valued functions.\n", "  The correlation diagram of the vibrational energy spectra associated with the\nstretching modes of triatomic molecules such as CO$_2$ and H$_2$O is analyzed\nby means of two interacting Morse oscillators. By considering a linear\ndependence of the structure and force constants ($x_g=g^o_{rr'}/g^o_{rr},\nx_f=f_{rr'}/f_{rr}$) going from the water parameters to the carbon dioxide, it\nis shown that the fidelity, entropy and Poincar\\'e sections detect the polyad\nbreaking process manifested in the transition from local to normal mode\nbehaviors. Additionally Poincar\\'e sections show a transition to chaos where\nthe polyad cannot be defined.\n", "  A parameterization of the nucleon-nucleon elastic scattering amplitude is\nneeded for future experiments with nucleon and nuclear beams in the beam\nmomentum range of 2 -- 50 GeV/c/nucleon. There are many parameterizations of\nthe amplitude at $P_{lab} >$ 25--50 GeV/c, and at $P_{lab} \\leq$ 5 GeV/c. Our\npaper is aimed to cover the range between 5 -- 50 GeV/c.\n  The amplitude is used in Glauber calculations of various cross sections and\nMonte Carlo simulations of nucleon-nucleon scatterings. Usually, the\ndifferential nucleon-nucleon elastic scattering cross sections are described by\nan exponential expression. Corresponding experimental data on $pp$ interactions\nat $|t|>$ 0.005 (GeV/c)$^2$ and $|t|\\leq$ 0.125 (GeV/c)$^2$ have been fit. We\npropose formulae to approximate the beam momentum dependence of these\nparameters in the momentum range considered. The same was done for $np$\ninteractions at $|t|\\leq$ 0.5 (GeV/c)$^2$. Expressions for the momentum\ndependence of the total and elastic cross sections, and the ratio of real to\nimaginary parts of the amplitude at zero momentum transfer are also given for\n$pp$ and $np$ collisions. These results are sufficient for a first\napproximation of the Glauber calculations. For more exact calculations we fit\nthe data at $|t|>$ 0.005 (GeV/c)$^2$ without restrictions on the maximum value\nof $|t|$ using an expression based on two coherent exponential. The parameters\nof the fits are found for the beam momentum range 2 -- 50 GeV/c.\n", "  We present the new R package CoinCalc for performing event coincidence\nanalysis (ECA), a novel statistical method to quantify the simultaneity of\nevents contained in two series of observations, either as simultaneous or\nlagged coincidences within a user-specific temporal tolerance window. The\npackage also provides different analytical as well as surrogate-based\nsignificance tests (valid under different assumptions about the nature of the\nobserved event series) as well as an intuitive visualization of the identified\ncoincidences. We demonstrate the usage of CoinCalc based on two typical\ngeoscientific example problems addressing the relationship between\nmeteorological extremes and plant phenology as well as that between soil\nproperties and land cover.\n", "  The widely-used Jones and Mueller differential polarization calculi allow\nnon-depolarizing deterministic polarization interactions, known to be elements\nof the $SO^+(1,3)$ Lorentz group, to be described in an efficient way. In this\nLetter, a stochastic differential Jones formalism is shown to provide a clear\nphysical insight on light depolarization, which arises from the interaction of\npolarized light with a random medium showing fluctuating anisotropic\nproperties. Based on this formalism, several \"intrinsic\" depolarization metrics\nnaturally arise to efficiently characterize light depolarization in a medium,\nand an irreversibility property of depolarizing transformations is finally\nestablished.\n", "  We carry Chebyshev-polynomial expansion of the inverse localization length of\nHermitian and non-Hermitian random chains as function of energy. For Hermitian\nmodels, the expansion produces numerically this energy-dependent function in\none run of the algorithm. This is in strong contrast to the standard\ntransfer-matrix method, which produces the inverse localization length for a\nfixed energy in each run. For non-Hermitian models, as in the transfer-matrix\nmethod, our algorithm computes the inverse localization length for a fixed\n(complex) energy. We also find a formula of the Chebyshev-polynomial expansion\nof the density of states of non-Hermitian models. As explained in more detail\nin the Introduction, our algorithm for non-Hermitian models may be the only\navailable efficient algorithm for finding the density of states of models with\ninteractions.\n", "  We propose a stringy construction giving rise to a class of interacting and\nnon-supersymmetric CFT's in six dimensions. Such theories may be obtained as an\nIR conformal fixed point of an RG flow ending up in a $(1, 0)$ theory in the\nUV. We provide the due holographic evidence in the context of massive type IIA\non $\\textrm {AdS}_{7}\\times M_3$, where $M_3$ is topologically an $S^3$. In\nparticular, in this paper we present a 10d flow solution which may be\ninterpreted as a non-BPS bound state of NS5, D6 and $\\overline{\\textrm{D6}}$\nbranes. Moreover, by adopting its 7d effective description, we are able to\nholographically compute the free energy and the operator spectrum in the novel\nIR conformal fixed point.\n", "  A ${\\cal PT }$-symmetric model for three interacting wave guides is\ninvestigated. Each wave guide is represented by an attractive $\\delta$-function\npotential being in equidistant positions. The two outer potentials are complex\ndescribing loss and gain, respectively. The real parts of the outer potentials\nare assumed to be equal. The major focus of the study lies on the occurrence of\nan exceptional point of third order and the physical effects of such\nsingularity. While some results resemble those from similar studies with two\nwave guides, the three wave guides appear to have a richer structure. Emphasis\nis placed on the fine tuning in the approach of the EP3 as this appears to be a\nparticular challenge for an experimental realization.\n", "  We investigate the influence of an electric field on trapped modes arising in\na two-dimensional curved quantum waveguide ${\\bf \\Omega}$ i.e. bound states of\nthe corresponding Laplace operator $-\\Delta\\_{{\\bf \\Omega}}$. Here the\ncurvature of the guide is supposed to satisfy some assumptions of analyticity,\nand decays as $O(|s|^{-\\varepsilon}), \\varepsilon > 3$ at infinity. We show\nthat under conditions on the electric field $ \\bf F$, ${\\bf H}(F):=\n-\\Delta\\_{{\\bf \\Omega}} + {\\bf F}. {\\bf x} $ has resonances near the discrete\neigenvalues of $-\\Delta\\_{{\\bf \\Omega}}$.\n", "  We discuss consistency of the nuclear effects between the electromagnetic and\nweak interactions. In order to study a possibility of different nuclear effects\nin the neutrino DIS process, double differential cross section data are\ncompared with these values obtained by the HKN07 nuclear parton distribution\nfunctions (nPDFs). Discrepancies are found in the small and large-$x$ regions,\nand difference of kinematical value $y$ dependence exists between the $\\nu$ and\n$\\bar{\\nu}$ data around $x=0.35$. Moreover, we study statistical significance\nof the neutrino DIS data in each $x$ bin and discuss about the possibility of\nthe different nuclear modifications.\n", "  We present neutron scattering measurements on powder samples of the spinel\nFeSc2S4 that reveal a previously unobserved magnetic ordering transition\noccurring at 11.8(2)~K. Magnetic ordering occurs subsequent to a subtle\ncubic-to-tetragonal structural transition which distorts Fe coordinating sulfur\ntetrahedra lifting the orbital degeneracy. The application of 1~GPa hydrostatic\npressure appears to destabilize this N\\'eel state, reducing the transition\ntemperature to 8.6(8)~K and redistributing magnetic spectral weight to higher\nenergies. The relative magnitudes of ordered $\\langle m \\rangle^2\\!=\\!3.1(2)$\nand fluctuating moments $\\langle \\delta m \\rangle^2\\!=\\!13(1)$ show that the\nmagnetically ordered ground state of FeSc2S4 is drastically renormalized and in\nproximity to criticality.\n", "  We report on radio and X-ray observations of the only known repeating Fast\nRadio Burst (FRB) source, FRB 121102. We have detected six additional radio\nbursts from this source: five with the Green Bank Telescope at 2 GHz, and one\nat 1.4 GHz at the Arecibo Observatory for a total of 17 bursts from this\nsource. All have dispersion measures consistent with a single value ($\\sim559$\npc cm$^{-3}$) that is three times the predicted maximum Galactic value. The\n2-GHz bursts have highly variable spectra like those at 1.4 GHz, indicating\nthat the frequency structure seen across the individual 1.4 and 2-GHz\nbandpasses is part of a wideband process. X-ray observations of the FRB 121102\nfield with the Swift and Chandra observatories show at least one possible\ncounterpart; however, the probability of chance superposition is high. A radio\nimaging observation of the field with the Jansky Very Large Array at 1.6 GHz\nyields a 5$\\sigma$ upper limit of 0.3 mJy on any point-source continuum\nemission. This upper limit, combined with archival WISE 22-$\\mu$m and IPHAS\nH$\\alpha$ surveys, rules out the presence of an intervening Galactic HII\nregion. We update our estimate of the FRB detection rate in the PALFA survey to\nbe 1.1$^{+3.7}_{-1.0} \\times 10^4$ FRBs sky$^{-1}$ day$^{-1}$ (95% confidence)\nfor peak flux density at 1.4 GHz above 300 mJy. We find that the intrinsic\nwidths of the 12 FRB 121102 bursts from Arecibo are, on average, significantly\nlonger than the intrinsic widths of the 13 single-component FRBs detected with\nthe Parkes telescope.\n", "  In this paper, we construct two lattices from the $\\tau$ functions of\n$A_4^{(1)}$-surface $q$-Painlev\\'e equations, on which quad-equations of ABS\ntype appear. Moreover, using the reduced hypercube structure, we obtain the Lax\npairs of the $A_4^{(1)}$-surface $q$-Painlev\\'e equations.\n", "  We study potential scattering in a two-dimensional electron gas with Rashba\nspin-orbit coupling in the limit that the energy of the scattering electron\napproaches the bottom of the lower spin-split band. Focusing on two\nspin-independent circularly symmetric potentials, an infinite barrier and a\ndelta-function shell, we show that scattering in this limit is qualitatively\ndifferent from both scattering in the higher spin-split band and scattering of\nelectrons without spin-orbit coupling. The scattering matrix is purely\noff-diagonal with both off-diagonal elements equal to one, and all angular\nmomentum channels contribute equally; the differential cross section becomes\nincreasingly peaked in the forward and backward scattering directions; the\ntotal cross section exhibits quantized plateaus. These features are independent\nof the details of the scattering potentials, and we conjecture them to be\nuniversal. Our results suggest that Rashba scattering in the low-energy limit\nbecomes effectively one-dimensional.\n", "  One-hundred-nm-scale electronic structure calculations were carried out on\nthe K supercomputer by our original simulation code ELSES\n(http://www.elses.jp/) The present paper reports preliminary results of\ntransport calculations for condensed organic polymers. Large-scale calculations\nare realized by novel massively parallel order-N algorithms. The transport\ncalculations were carried out as a theoretical extension for the quantum\nwavepacket dynamics simulation. The method was applied to a single polymer\nchain and condensed polymers.\n", "  We present a short survey of a novel approach, called \"ETH approach\", to the\nquantum theory of events happening in isolated physical systems and to the\neffective time evolution of states of systems featuring events. In particular,\nwe attempt to present a clear explanation of what is meant by an \"event\" in\nquantum mechanics and of the significance of this notion. We then outline a\ntheory of direct (projective) and indirect observations or recordings of\nphysical quantities and events. Some key ideas underlying our general theory\nare illustrated by studying a simple quantum-mechanical model of a mesoscopic\nsystem.\n", "  The non-unitarity of the leptonic mixing matrix is a generic signal of new\nphysics aiming at the generation of the observed neutrino masses. We discuss\nthe Minimal Unitarity Violation (MUV) scheme, an effective field theory\nframework which represents the class of extensions of the Standard Model (SM)\nby heavy neutral leptons, and discuss the present bounds on the non-unitarity\nparameters as well as estimates for the sensitivity of the Circular Electron\nPositron Collider (CEPC), based on the performance parameters from the preCDR.\n", "  Grand Unified Theories (GUTs) are attractive candidates for more fundamental\nelementary particle theories. They can not only unify the Standard Model (SM)\ninteractions but also different types of SM fermions, in particular quarks and\nleptons, in joint representations of the GUT gauge group. We discuss how\ncomparing predictive supersymmetric GUT models with the experimental results\nfor quark and charged lepton masses leads to constraints on the SUSY spectrum.\nWe show an example from a recent analysis where the resulting superpartner\nmasses where found just beyond the reach of LHC run 1, but fully within the\nreach of a 100 TeV pp collider.\n", "  It is well known that low-dimensional nonlinear deterministic maps close to a\ntangent bifurcation exhibit intermittency and this circumstance has been\nexploited, e.g. by Procaccia and Schuster [Phys. Rev. A 28, 1210 (1983)], to\ndevelop a general theory of 1/f spectra. This suggests it is interesting to\nstudy the extent to which the behavior of a high-dimensional stochastic system\ncan be described by such tangent maps. The Tangled Nature (TaNa) Model of\nevolutionary ecology is an ideal candidate for such a study, a significant\nmodel as it is capable of reproducing a broad range of the phenomenology of\nmacroevolution and ecosystems. The TaNa model exhibits strong intermittency\nreminiscent of Punctuated Equilibrium and, like the fossil record of mass\nextinction, the intermittency in the model is found to be non-stationary, a\nfeature typical of many complex systems. We derive a mean-field version for the\nevolution of the likelihood function controlling the reproduction of species\nand find a local map close to tangency. This mean-field map, by our own local\napproximation, is able to describe qualitatively only one episode of the\nintermittent dynamics of the full TaNa model. To complement this result we\nconstruct a complete nonlinear dynamical system model consisting of successive\ntangent bifurcations that generates time evolution patterns resembling those of\nthe full TaNa model in macroscopic scales. In spite of the limitations of our\napproach, that entails a drastic collapse of degrees of freedom, the\ndescription of a high-dimensional model system in terms of a low-dimensional\none appears to be illuminating.\n", "  In this work we present a mimetic spectral element discretization for the 2D\nincompressible Navier-Stokes equations that in the limit of vanishing\ndissipation exactly preserves mass, kinetic energy, enstrophy and total\nvorticity on unstructured grids. The essential ingredients to achieve this are:\n(i) a velocity-vorticity formulation in rotational form, (ii) a sequence of\nfunction spaces capable of exactly satisfying the divergence free nature of the\nvelocity field, and (iii) a conserving time integrator. Proofs for the exact\ndiscrete conservation properties are presented together with numerical test\ncases on highly irregular grids.\n", "  We report on the development of tools to calculate loop integrals and\namplitudes beyond one loop. In particular, we review new features of the\nprogram SecDec which can be used for the numerical evaluation of parametric\nintegrals like multi-loop integrals.\n", "  One item on the agenda of future colliders is certain to be the Higgs boson.\nWhat is it trying to tell us? The primary objective of any future collider must\nsurely be to identify physics beyond the Standard Model, and supersymmetry is\none of the most studied options. it Is supersymmetry waiting for us and, if so,\ncan LHC Run 2 find it? The big surprise from the initial 13-TeV LHC data has\nbeen the appearance of a possible signal for a new boson X with a mass ~750\nGeV. What are the prospects for future colliders if the X(750) exists? One of\nthe most intriguing possibilities in electroweak physics would be the discovery\nof non-perturbative phenomena. What are the prospects for observing sphalerons\nat the LHC or a future collider?\n", "  In experimental physics, lab notebooks play an essential role in the research\nprocess. For all of the ubiquity of lab notebooks, little formal attention has\nbeen paid to addressing what is considered `best practice' for scientific\ndocumentation and how researchers come to learn these practices in experimental\nphysics. Using interviews with practicing researchers, namely physics graduate\nstudents, we explore the different experiences researchers had in learning how\nto effectively use a notebook for scientific documentation. We find that very\nfew of those interviewed thought that their undergraduate lab classes\nsuccessfully taught them the benefit of maintaining a lab notebook. Most\ndescribed training in lab notebook use as either ineffective or outright\nmissing from their undergraduate lab course experience. Furthermore, a large\nmajority of those interviewed explained that they did not receive any formal\ntraining in maintaining a lab notebook during their graduate school experience\nand received little to no feedback from their advisors on these records. Many\nof the interviewees describe learning the purpose of, and how to maintain,\nthese kinds of lab records only after having a period of trial and error,\nhaving already started doing research in their graduate program. Despite the\ncentral role of scientific documentation in the research enterprise, these\nphysics graduate students did not gain skills in documentation through formal\ninstruction, but rather through informal hands-on practice.\n", "  The Operator Product Expansion approach to scattering amplitudes in maximally\nsupersymmetric gauge theory operates in terms of pentagon transitions for\nexcitations propagating on a color flux tube. These obey a set of axioms which\nallow one to determine them to all orders in 't Hooft coupling and confront\nagainst explicit calculations. One of the simplifying features of the formalism\nis the factorizability of multiparticle transitions in terms of single-particle\nones. In this paper we extend an earlier consideration of a sector populated by\none kind of excitations to the case of a system with fermionic as well as\nbosonic degrees of freedom to address the origin of the factorization. While\nthe purely bosonic case was analyzed within an integrable noncompact open-spin\nchain model, the current case is solved in the framework of a supersymmetric\nsl(2|1) magnet. We find the eigenfunctions for the multiparticle system making\nuse of the R-matrix approach. Constructing resulting pentagon transitions, we\nprove their factorized form. The discussion corresponds to leading order of\nperturbation theory.\n", "  We study a warm-tachyon inflationary model non-minimally coupled to a\nGauss-Bonnet term. The general conditions required for reliability of the model\nare obtained by considerations of a combined hierarchy of Hubble and\nGauss-Bonnet flow functions. The perturbed equations are comprehensively\nderived in the longitudinal gauge in the presence of slow-roll and quasi-stable\nconditions. General expressions for observable quantities of interest such as\nthe tensor-to-scalar ratio, scalar spectral index and its running are found in\nthe high dissipation regime. Finally, the model is solved using exponential and\ninverse power-law potentials, which satisfy the properties of a tachyon\npotential, with parameters of the model being constrained within the framework\nof the Planck 2015 data. We show that the Gauss-Bonnet coupling constant\ncontrols termination of inflation in such a way as to be in good agreement with\nthe Planck 2015 data.\n", "  In gravel-bed rivers, bedload transport exhibits considerable variability in\ntime and space. Recently, stochastic bedload transport theories have been\ndeveloped to address the mechanisms and effects of bedload transport\nfluctuations. Stochastic models involve parameters such as particle\ndiffusivity, entrainment and deposition rates. The lack of hard information on\nhow these parameters vary with flow conditions is a clear impediment to their\napplication to real-world scenarios. In this paper, we determined the closure\nequations for the above parameters from laboratory experiments. We focused on\nshallow supercritical flow on a sloping mobile bed in straight channels, a\nsetting that was representative of flow conditions in mountain rivers.\nExperiments were run at low sediment transport rates under steady nonuniform\nflow conditions (i.e., the water discharge was kept constant, but bedforms\ndeveloped and migrated upstream, making flow nonuniform). Using image\nprocessing, we reconstructed particle paths to deduce the particle velocity and\nits probability distribution, particle diffusivity, and rates of deposition and\nentrainment. We found that on average, particle acceleration, velocity and\ndeposition rate were responsive to local flow conditions, whereas entrainment\nrate depended strongly on local bed activity. Particle diffusivity varied\nlinearly with the depth-averaged flow velocity. The empirical probability\ndistribution of particle velocity was well approximated by a Gaussian\ndistribution when all particle positions were considered together. In contrast,\nthe particles located in close vicinity to the bed had exponentially\ndistributed velocities. Our experimental results provide closure equations for\nstochastic or deterministic bedload transport models.\n", "  This work is devoted to explore fundamental aspects of the spectral\nproperties of few-body general operators. We first consider the following\nquestion: when we know the probability distributions of a set of observables,\nwhat can we way on the probability distribution of the summation of them? In\nconsidering arbitrary operators, we could not obtain a useful information over\nthird order moment, while under the assumption of the few-body operators, we\ncan rigorously prove a much stronger bound on the moment generating function\nfor arbitrary quantum states. Second, by the use of this bound, we generalize\nthe Chernoff inequality (or the Hoeffding inequality), which characterizes the\nasymptotic decay of the probability distribution for the product states by the\nGaussian decay. In the present form, the Chernoff inequality can be applied to\na summation of independent local observables (e.g., single-site operators). We\nextend the range of application of the Chernoff inequality to the generic\nfew-body observables.\n", "  The Axelrod library is an open source Python package that allows for\nreproducible game theoretic research into the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma. This\narea of research began in the 1980s but suffers from a lack of documentation\nand test code. The goal of the library is to provide such a resource, with\nfacilities for the design of new strategies and interactions between them, as\nwell as conducting tournaments and ecological simulations for populations of\nstrategies.\n  With a growing collection of 139 strategies, the library is a also a platform\nfor an original tournament that, in itself, is of interest to the game\ntheoretic community. This paper describes the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma, the\nAxelrod library and its development, and insights gained from some novel\nresearch.\n", "  Thermal expansion, electrical resistivity, magnetization, and specific heat\nmeasurements were performed on URu$_{2-x}$Fe$_{x}$Si$_{2}$ single crystals for\nvarious values of the Fe concentration $x$ in both the hidden order (HO) and\nlarge moment antiferromagnetic (LMAFM) regions of the phase diagram. Our\nresults show that the paramagnetic (PM) to HO and LMAFM phase transitions are\nmanifested differently in the thermal expansion coefficient. For Fe\nconcentrations near the boundary between the HO and LMAFM phases at $x_c$ ~\n0.1, we observe two features in the thermal expansion upon cooling, one that\nappears to be associated with the transition from the PM to the HO phase and\nanother one at lower temperature that may be due to the transition from the HO\nto the LMAFM phase. These two features have not been observed in other\nmeasurements such as specific heat or neutron scattering. In addition, the\nuniaxial pressure derivative of the transition temperature, based on a\ncalculation using thermal expansion and specific heat data, changes\ndramatically when crossing from the HO to the LMAFM phase.\n", "  By solving the rate equation in an expanding quark-gluon plasma, we study\nthermal production of charm quarks in central Pb+Pb collisions at the Future\nCircular Collider. With the charm quark production cross section taken from the\nperturbative QCD at the next-to-leading order, we find that charm quark\nproduction from the quark-gluon plasma can be appreciable compared to that due\nto initial hard scattering between colliding nucleons.\n", "  Based on an interpretation of the quark-lepton symmetry in terms of the\nunimodularity of the color group $SU(3)$ and on the existence of 3 generations,\nwe develop an argumentation suggesting that the \"finite quantum space\"\ncorresponding to the exceptional real Jordan algebra of dimension 27 (the\nEuclidean Albert algebra) is relevant for the description of internal spaces in\nthe theory of particles. In particular, the triality which corresponds to the 3\noff-diagonal octonionic elements of the exceptional algebra is associated to\nthe 3 generations of the Standard Model while the representation of the\noctonions as a complex 4-dimensional space $\\mathbb C\\oplus\\mathbb C^3$ is\nassociated to the quark-lepton symmetry, (one complex for the lepton and 3 for\nthe corresponding quark). More generally it is is suggested that the\nreplacement of the algebra of real functions on spacetime by the algebra of\nfunctions on spacetime with values in a finite-dimensional Euclidean Jordan\nalgebra which plays the role of \"the algebra of real functions\" on the\ncorresponding almost classical quantum spacetime is relevant in particle\nphysics. This leads us to study the theory of Jordan modules and to develop the\ndifferential calculus over Jordan algebras, (i.e. to introduce the appropriate\nnotion of differential forms). We formulate the corresponding definition of\nconnections on Jordan modules.\n", "  We review recent progress that we have achieved in evaluating the class of\nfully massive vacuum integrals at five loops. After discussing topics that\narise in classification, evaluation and algorithmic codification of this\nspecific set of Feynman integrals, we present some selected new results for\ntheir expansions around $4-2\\varepsilon$ dimensions.\n", "  We report on detection, from observations obtained with the APOGEE\nspectroscopic survey, of a metal-poor ([Fe/H] $= -1.3$ dex) field giant star\nwith an extreme Mg-Al abundance ratio ([Mg/Fe] $= -0.31$ dex; [Al/Fe] $= 1.49$\ndex). Such low Mg/Al ratios are seen only among the second-generation\npopulation of globular clusters, and are not present among Galactic disk field\nstars. The light element abundances of this star, 2M16011638-1201525, suggest\nthat it could have been born in a globular cluster. We explore several origin\nscenarios, in particular studying the orbit of the star to check the\nprobability of it being kinematically related to known globular clusters. We\nperformed simple orbital integrations assuming the estimated distance of\n2M16011638-1201525 and the available six-dimensional phase-space coordinates of\n63 globular clusters, looking for close encounters in the past with a minimum\ndistance approach within the tidal radius of each cluster. We found a very low\nprobability that 2M16011638-1201525 was ejected from most globular clusters;\nhowever, we note that the best progenitor candidate to host this star is\nglobular cluster $\\omega$ Centauri (NGC 5139). Our dynamical investigation\ndemonstrates that 2M16011638-1201525 reaches a distance $|Z_{max}| < 3 $ kpc\nfrom the Galactic plane and a minimum and maximum approach to the Galactic\ncenter of $R_{min}<0.62$ kpc and $R_{max}<7.26$ kpc in an eccentric\n($e\\sim0.53$) and retrograde orbit. Since the extreme chemical anomaly of\n2M16011638-1201525 has also been observed in halo field stars, this object\ncould also be considered a halo contaminant, likely been ejected into the Milky\nWay disk from the halo. We conclude that, 2M16011638-20152 is also\nkinematically consistent with the disk but chemically consistent with halo\nfield stars.\n", "  We study the environment of 23 submillimetre galaxies (SMGs) drawn from the\nJCMT/AzTEC 1.1mm S/N-limited sample in the COSMOS field, as well as 4 COSMOS\nSMGs at z_spec>4.5, and 1 at z_spec=2.49, yielding a sample of 28 SMGs. We\nsearch for overdensities using the COSMOS photometric redshifts based on over\n30 UV-NIR photometric bands, reaching an accuracy of sigma(Delta\nz/(1+z))=0.0067 (0.0155) at z<3.5 (>3.5). To identify overdensities we apply\nthe Voronoi tessellation analysis, and estimate the overdensity estimator\ndelta_g as a function of distance from the SMG and/or overdensity center. We\ntest and validate our approach via simulations, X-ray detected groups, and\nspectroscopic verifications using VUDS and zCOSMOS catalogues showing that even\nwith photometric redshifts in COSMOS we can efficiently retrieve overdensities\nout to z~5. Our results yield that 11/23 (48%) JCMT/AzTEC 1.1mm SMGs occupy\noverdense environments. Considering the entire JCMT/AzTEC 1.1mm S/N>4 sample,\nand accounting for the expected fraction of spurious detections, yields that\n35-61% of the SMGs in the S/N-limited sample occupy overdense environments. We\nperform an X-ray stacking analysis in the 0.5-2keV band using a 32\" aperture\nand our SMG positions, and find statistically significant detections. For our\nz<2 [z>2] subsample we find an average flux of (4.0+/-0.8)x10^{-16}\n[(1.3+/-0.5)x10^{-16}] erg/s/cm^2 and a corresponding total mass of M_200 =\n2.8x10^{13} [2x10^{13}] MSol. Our results suggest a higher occurrence of SMGs\noccupying overdense environments at z>3, than at z<3. This may be understood if\nhighly star forming galaxies can only be formed in the highest peaks of the\ndensity field tracing the most massive dark matter haloes at early cosmic\nepochs, while at later times cosmic structure may have matured sufficiently\nthat more modest overdensities correspond to sufficiently massive haloes to\nform SMGs.\n", "  The mechanism of fusion hindrance, an effect preventing the synthesis of\nsuperheavy elements in the reactions of cold and hot fusion, is investigated\nusing the Boltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck equation, where Coulomb interaction is\nintroduced. A strong sensitivity is observed both to the modulus of\nincompressibility of symmetric nuclear matter, controlling the competition of\nsurface tension and Coulomb repulsion, and to the stiffness of the\ndensity-dependence of symmetry energy, influencing the formation of the neck\nprior to scission. The experimental fusion probabilities were for the first\ntime used to derive constraints on the nuclear equation of state. A strict\nconstraint on the modulus of incompressibility of nuclear matter $K_0 = 240 -\n260$ MeV is obtained while the stiff density-dependences of the symmetry energy\n($\\gamma>1.$) are rejected.\n", "  The physics potential of the Circular Electron Positron Collider (CEPC) can\nbe significantly strengthened by two detectors with complementary designs. A\npromising detector approach based on the Silicon Detector (SiD) designed for\nthe International Linear Collider (ILC) is presented. Several simplifications\nof this detector for the lower energies expected at the CEPC are proposed. A\nnumber of cost optimizations of this detector are illustrated using full\ndetector simulations. We show that the proposed changes will enable to reach\nthe physics goals at the CEPC.\n", "  We investigate the sensitivity of future lepton colliders to displaced\nvertices from the decays of long-lived heavy (almost sterile) neutrinos with\nelectroweak scale masses and detectable time of flight. As future lepton\ncolliders we consider the FCC-ee, the CEPC, and the ILC, searching at the\nZ-pole and at the center-of-mass energies of 240, 350 and 500 GeV. For a\nrealistic discussion of the detector response to the displaced vertex signal\nand the Standard Model background we consider the ILC's Silicon Detector (SiD)\nas benchmark for the future lepton collider detectors. We find that displaced\nvertices constitute a powerful search channel for sterile neutrinos, sensitive\nto squared active-sterile mixing angles as small as $10^{-11}$.\n", "  We report the batch fabrication of graphene field-effect-transistors (GFETs)\nwith nanoperforated graphene as channel. The transistors were cut and\nencapsulated. The encapsulated GFETs display saturation regions that can be\ntuned by modifying the top gate voltage, and have on/off ratios of up to 10^8\nat room temperature. In addition, the nanoperforated GFETs display orders of\nmagnitude higher photoresponses than any room-temperature graphene detector\nconfigurations that do not involve heterostructures with bandgap materials.\n", "  In this study of the Inert Doublet Model (IDM), we propose that the dijet +\nmissing transverse energy channel at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) will be an\neffective way of searching for the scalar particles of the IDM. This channel\nreceives contributions from gauge boson fusion, and $t-$channel production,\nalong with contributions from $H^+$ associated production. We perform the\nanalysis including study of the Standard Model (SM) background with assumed\nsystematic uncertainty, and optimise the selection criteria employing suitable\ncuts on the kinematic variables to maximise the signal significance. We find\nthat with high luminosity option of the LHC, this channel has the potential to\nprobe the IDM in the mass range of up to about 400 GeV, which is not accessible\nthrough other leptonic channels. In a scenario with light dark matter of mass\nabout 65 GeV, charged Higgs in the mass range of around 200 GeV provides the\nbest possibility with a signal significance of about $2\\sigma$ at an integrated\nluminosity of about 3000 fb$^{-1}$.\n", "  Cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) has been emerged as a novel technology for\ncancer treatment. CAP can directly treat cells and tissue but such direct\napplication is limited to skin or can be invoked as a supplement during open\nsurgery. In this study we report indirect plasma treatment using CAP discharged\nin DI water using three gases as carriers (argon, helium and nitrogen). Plasma\nstimulated water was applied to human breast cancer cell line (MDA-MB-231). MTT\nassay tests showed that using argon plasma had the strongest effect on inducing\napoptosis in cultured human breast cancer cells. This result is attributed to\nthe elevated production of the reactive oxygen species and reactive nitrogen\nspecies in water in the case of argon plasma.\n", "  The maximum entropy method is examined as a new tool for solving the\nill-posed inversion problem involved in the Lorentz integral transformation\n(LIT) method. As an example, we apply the method to the spin-dipole strength\nfunction of 4He. We show that the method can be successfully used for inversion\nof LIT, provided the LIT function is available with a sufficient accuracy.\n", "  Here, we attempt to summarize the activities of Track 3 of the 17th\nInternational Workshop on Advanced Computing and Analysis Techniques in Physics\nResearch (ACAT 2016).\n", "  We show that supersymmetric effects driven by penguin contributions to the $b\n\\to c \\tau \\nu_\\tau$ transition are able to account simultaneously for a\nsignificant increase of both branching ratios of $\\bar{B}\\to D\n\\tau\\bar{\\nu}_{\\tau}$ and $\\bar{B} \\to D^{*} \\tau\\bar{\\nu}_{\\tau}$ with respect\nto the Standard Model predictions, thereby approaching their experimentally\nmeasured values. {We emphasise that a degeneracy between the lightest chargino\nand neutralino (wino-like) masses is an essential condition for enhancing the\neffect of the lepton penguin $\\tau \\nu_\\tau W^{\\pm}$, which is responsible for\nthe improved theoretical predictions with respect to current data.\n", "  We study on-shell diagrams for gravity theories with any number of\nsupersymmetries and find a compact Grassmannian formula in terms of edge\nvariables of the graphs. Unlike in gauge theory where the analogous form\ninvolves only $\\dlog$-factors, in gravity there is a non-trivial numerator as\nwell as higher degree poles in the edge variables. Based on the structure of\nthe Grassmannian formula for $\\N=8$ supergravity we conjecture that gravity\nloop amplitudes also possess similar properties. In particular, we find that\nthere are only logarithmic singularities on cuts with finite loop momentum,\npoles at infinity are present and loop amplitudes show special behavior on\ncertain collinear cuts. We demonstrate on 1-loop and 2-loop examples that the\nbehavior on collinear cuts is a highly non-trivial property which requires\ncancellations between all terms contributing to the amplitude.\n", "  The summary of the available semi-analytical results for the three-loop\ncorrections to the QCD static potential and for the $\\mathcal{O}(\\alpha_s^4)$\ncontributions to the ratio of the running and pole heavy quark masses are\npresented. The procedure of the determination of the dependence of the\nfour-loop contribution to the pole-running heavy quarks mass ratio on the\nnumber of quarks flavours, based on application of the least squares method is\ndescribed. The necessity of clarifying the reason of discrepancy between the\nnumerical uncertainties of the $\\alpha_s^4$ coefficients in the mass ratio,\nobtained by this mathematical method by the direct numerical calculations is\nemphasised.\n", "  We studied the novel multiferroic material Sr$_2$FeSi$_2$O$_7$, and found 3\nabsorption modes above the magnetic ordering transition temperature using\ntime-domain terahertz spectroscopy. These absorption modes can be explained as\nthe optical transitions between the spin-orbit coupling and crystal field split\n3d$^6$ Fe$^{2+}$ ground state term in this material. Consideration of the\ncompressed tetrahedral environment of the Fe$^{2+}$ site is crucial to\nunderstand the excitations. We point out, however, discrepancies between the\nsingle-site atomic picture and the experimental results.\n", "  We discuss the stability properties of the solutions of the general nonlinear\nSchroedinger equation (NLSE) in 1+1 dimensions in an external potential\nderivable from a parity-time (PT) symmetric superpotential $W(x)$ that we\nconsidered earlier [Kevrekedis et al Phys. Rev. E 92, 042901 (2015)]. In\nparticular we consider the nonlinear partial differential equation $\\{ i\n\\partial_t + \\partial_x^2 - V^{-}(x) +| \\psi(x,t) |^{2\\kappa} \\} \\, \\psi(x,t) =\n0$, for arbitrary nonlinearity parameter $\\kappa$. We study the bound state\nsolutions when $V^{-}(x) = (1/4- b^2)$ sech$^2(x)$, which can be derived from\ntwo different superpotentials $W(x)$, one of which is complex and $PT$\nsymmetric. Using Derrick's theorem, as well as a time dependent variational\napproximation, we derive exact analytic results for the domain of stability of\nthe trapped solution as a function of the depth $b^2$ of the external\npotential. We compare the regime of stability found from these analytic\napproaches with a numerical linear stability analysis using a variant of the\nVakhitov-Kolokolov (V-K) stability criterion. The numerical results of applying\nthe V-K condition give the same answer for the domain of stability as the\nanalytic result obtained from applying Derrick's theorem. Our main result is\nthat for $\\kappa>2$ a new regime of stability for the exact solutions appears\nas long as $b > b_{crit}$, where $b_{crit}$ is a function of the nonlinearity\nparameter $\\kappa$. In the absence of the potential the related solitary wave\nsolutions of the NLSE are unstable for $\\kappa>2$.\n", "  We employ a first principles, force-level approach to self-consistently\nconstruct the anharmonic tube confinement field for entangled fluids of rigid\nneedles and for primitive-path (PP) level chains in two limiting situations\nwhere chain stretching is assumed to either completely relax or remain\nunrelaxed. The influence of shear and extensional deformation and polymer\norientation is determined in a nonlinear elastic limit where dissipative\nrelaxation processes are intentionally neglected. For needles and PP-level\nchains, a Gaussian analysis of transverse polymer dynamical fluctuations\npredicts that deformation-induced orientation leads to tube dilation. In\ncontrast, for deformed polymers in which chain stretch does not relax we find\ntube compression. For all three systems, a finite maximum transverse\nentanglement force localizing the polymers in effective tubes is predicted. The\nconditions when this entanglement force can be overcome (a force imbalance) by\nan externally applied force associated with macroscopic deformation can be\ncrisply defined in the nonlinear elastic limit, and the possibility of a\n\"microscopic absolute yielding\" event destroying the tube confinement can be\nanalyzed. For needles and contour-relaxed PP chains, this force imbalance is\nfound to occur at a stress of order the equilibrium shear modulus and thus a\nstrain of order unity, corresponding to a mechanically fragile entanglement\ntube field. However, for unrelaxed stretched chains, tube compression\nstabilizes transverse polymer confinement, and there appears to be no force\nimbalance. These results collectively suggest that the crossover from elastic\nto irreversible viscous response requires chain retraction to initiate\ndisentanglement. We qualitatively discuss comparisons with existing\nphenomenological models for nonlinear startup shear, step strain, and creep\nrheology experiments.\n", "  In this paper we discuss the method of the resummation of the asymptotic\nseries suggested by Kazakov et al. (1978) and predictions of the higher order\nterms based on this approach. Application of this method to $\\varphi^4$ model\nis discussed.\n", "  The numerical simulation of acoustic waves in complex 3D media is a key topic\nin many branches of science, from exploration geophysics to non-destructive\ntesting and medical imaging. With the drastic increase in computing\ncapabilities this field has dramatically grown in the last twenty years.\nHowever many 3D computations, especially at high frequency and/or long range,\nare still far beyond current reach and force researchers to resort to\napproximations, for example by working in 2D (plane strain) or by using a\nparaxial approximation. This article presents and validates a numerical\ntechnique based on an axisymmetric formulation of a spectral finite-element\nmethod in the time domain for heterogeneous fluid-solid media. Taking advantage\nof axisymmetry enables the study of relevant 3D configurations at a very\nmoderate computational cost. The axisymmetric spectral-element formulation is\nfirst introduced, and validation tests are then performed. A typical\napplication of interest in ocean acoustics showing upslope propagation above a\ndipping viscoelastic ocean bottom is then presented. The method correctly\nmodels backscattered waves and explains the transmission losses discrepancies\npointed out in Jensen et al. (2007). Finally, a realistic application to a\ndouble seamount problem is considered.\n", "  We prove uniform decay estimates in the entire exterior of the Schwarzschild\nblack hole for gauge invariant norms on the Yang-Mills fields valued in the Lie\nalgebra associated to the Lie group $SU(2)$. We assume that the initial data\nare spherically symmetric satisfying a certain Ansatz, and have small energy,\nwhich eliminates the stationary solutions which do not decay. In particular,\nthere don't exist any Coulomb type solutions satisfying this Ansatz. We first\nprove a Morawetz type estimate for the Yang-Mills fields within this setting,\nusing the Yang-Mills equations directly. We then adapt the proof constructed in\nprevious work by the first author to show local energy decay and uniform decay\nof the $L^{\\infty}$ norm of the middle components in the entire exterior of the\nSchwarzschild black hole, including the event horizon.\n", "  Analyzing signals arising from dynamical systems typically requires many\nmodeling assumptions and parameter estimation. In high dimensions, this\nmodeling is particularly difficult due to the \"curse of dimensionality\". In\nthis paper, we propose a method for building an intrinsic representation of\nsuch signals in a purely data-driven manner. First, we apply a manifold\nlearning technique, diffusion maps, to learn the intrinsic model of the latent\nvariables of the dynamical system, solely from the measurements. Second, we use\nconcepts and tools from control theory and build a linear contracting observer\nto estimate the latent variables in a sequential manner from new incoming\nmeasurements. The effectiveness of the presented framework is demonstrated by\napplying it to a toy problem and to a music analysis application. In these\nexamples we show that our method reveals the intrinsic variables of the\nanalyzed dynamical systems.\n", "  Electromagnetic fields are generated in high energy nuclear collisions by\nspectator valence protons. These fields are traditionally computed by\nintegrating the Maxwell equations with point sources. One might expect that\nsuch an approach is valid at distances much larger than the proton size and\nthus such a classical approach should work well for almost the entire\ninteraction region in the case of heavy nuclei. We argue that, in fact, the\ncontrary is true: due to the quantum diffusion of the proton wave function, the\nclassical approximation breaks down at distances of the order of the system\nsize. We compute the electromagnetic field created by a charged particle\ndescribed initially as a Gaussian wave packet of width 1 fm and evolving in\nvacuum according to the Klein-Gordon equation. We completely neglect the medium\neffects. We show that the dynamics, magnitude and even sign of the\nelectromagnetic field created by classical and quantum sources are different.\n", "  We present Version 9 of the Feynman-diagram calculator FormCalc and a\nflexible new suite of shell scripts and Mathematica packages based on FormCalc,\nwhich can be adapted and used as a template for calculations.\n", "  Most studies of the pulsar magnetosphere have assumed a pure magnetic dipole\nin flat spacetime. However, recent work suggests that the effects of general\nrelativity are in fact of vital importance and that realistic pulsar magnetic\nfields will have a significant nondipolar component. We introduce a general\nanalytical method for studying the axisymmetric force-free magnetosphere of a\nslowly-rotating star of arbitrary magnetic field, mass, radius and moment of\ninertia, including all the effects of general relativity. We confirm that\nspacelike current is generically present in the polar caps (suggesting a pair\nproduction region), irrespective of the stellar magnetic field. We show that\ngeneral relativity introduces a ~60% correction to the formula for the dipolar\ncomponent of the surface magnetic field inferred from spindown. Finally, we\nshow that the location and shape of the polar caps can be modified dramatically\nby even modestly strong higher moments. This can affect emission processes\noccurring near the star and may help explain the modified beam characteristics\nof millisecond pulsars.\n", "  An interface electron state at the junction between a three-dimensional\ntopological insulator (TI) film of Bi2Se3 and a ferrimagnetic insulator film of\nY3Fe5O12 (YIG) was investigated by measurements of angle-resolved photoelectron\nspectroscopy and X-ray absorption magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD). The\nsurface state of the Bi2Se3 film was directly observed and localized 3d spin\nstates of the Fe3+ state in the YIG film were confirmed. The proximity effect\nis likely described in terms of the exchange interaction between the localized\nFe 3d electrons in the YIG film and delocalized electrons of the surface and\nbulk states in the Bi2Se3 film. The Curie temperature (TC) may be increased by\nreducing the amount of the interface Fe2+ ions with opposite spin direction\nobservable as a pre-edge in the XMCD spectra.\n", "  Using the concept of 3-Lie bialgebra, which has recently been defined in\narXiv:1604.04475, we construct Bagger-Lambert-Gustavson (BLG) model for\nM2-brane on Manin triple of a special 3-Lie bialgebra. Then by using the\ncorrespondence and relation between those 3-Lie bialgebra with Lie bialgebra,\nwe reduce this model to an $N=(4,4)$ WZW model (D2-brane), such that, its\nalgebraic structure is a Lie bialgebra with one 2-cocycle. In this manner by\nusing correspondence of 3-Lie bialgebra and Lie bialgebra (for this special\n3-Lie algebra) one can construct M2-brane from a D2-brane and vice versa.\n", "  We consider quantum integrable models with $\\mathfrak{gl}(2|1)$ symmetry. We\nderive a set of multiple commutation relations between the monodromy matrix\nentries. These multiple commutation relations allow us to obtain different\nrepresentations for Bethe vectors.\n", "  We extend covert communication to the quantum regime by showing that covert\nquantum communication is possible over optical channels with noise arising\neither from the environment or from the sender's lab. In particular, we show\nthat sequences of qubits can be transmitted covertly by using both a single\nphoton and a coherent state encoding. We study the possibility of performing\ncovert quantum key distribution and show that positive key rates and covertness\ncan be achieved simultaneously. Covert communication requires a secret key\nbetween sender and receiver, which raises the problem of how this key can be\nregenerated covertly. We show that covert QKD consumes more key than it can\ngenerate and propose instead a hybrid protocol for covert key regeneration that\nuses pseudorandom number generators (PRNGs) together with covert QKD to\nregenerate secret keys. The security of the new key is guaranteed by QKD while\nthe security of the covert communication is at least as strong as the security\nof the PRNG.\n", "  In this article we show that the use of Deligne-Beilinson cohomology in the\ncontext of the $U(1)$ BF theory on a closed 3-manifold $M$ yields a discrete\n$\\Z_N$ BF theory whose partition function is an abelian TV invariant of $M$. By\ncomparing the expectation values of the $U(1)$ and $\\mathbb{Z}_N$ holonomies in\nboth BF theories we obtain a reciprocity formula.\n", "  A spectrogram is a useful way of using short-time discrete Fourier transforms\nto visualise surface height measurements taken of ship wakes in real world\nconditions. For a steadily moving ship that leaves behind small-amplitude\nwaves, the spectrogram is known to have two clear linear components, a\nsliding-frequency mode caused by the divergent waves and a constant-frequency\nmode for the transverse waves. However, recent observations of high speed ferry\ndata have identified additional components of the spectrograms that are not yet\nexplained. We use computer simulations of linear and nonlinear ship wave\npatterns and apply time-frequency analysis to generate spectrograms for an\nidealised ship. We clarify the role of the linear dispersion relation and ship\nspeed on the two linear components. We use a simple weakly nonlinear theory to\nidentify higher order effects in a spectrogram and, while the high speed ferry\ndata is very noisy, we propose that certain additional features in the\nexperimental data are caused by nonlinearity. Finally, we provide a possible\nexplanation for a further discrepancy between the high speed ferry spectrograms\nand linear theory by accounting for ship acceleration.\n", "  The nature of the flow below the cloud level on Jupiter and Saturn is still\nunknown. Relating the flow on these planets to perturbations in their density\nfield is key to the analysis of the gravity measurements expected from both the\nJuno (Jupiter) and Cassini (Saturn) spacecrafts during 2016-17. Both missions\nwill provide latitude-dependent gravity fields, which in principle could be\ninverted to calculate the vertical structure of the observed cloud-level zonal\nflow on these planets. Theories to date connecting the gravity field and the\nflow structure have been limited to potential theories under a barotropic\nassumption, or estimates based on thermal wind balance that allow analyzing\nbaroclinic wind structures, but have made simplifying assumptions. Those\ninclude the effects of the deviations from spherical symmetry, the centrifugal\nforce due to density perturbations, and self-gravitational effects of the\ndensity perturbations. Recent studies attempted to include some effects but not\nin a self-consistent manner. The present study introduces such a\nself-consistent perturbation approach to the thermal wind balance that\nincorporates all physical effects, and applies it to several example wind\nstructures, both barotropic and baroclinic. The contribution of each term is\nanalyzed, and the results are compared in the barotropic limit to those of\npotential theory. It is found that the dominant balance involves the original\nsimplified thermal wind approach. This balance produces a good\norder-of-magnitude estimate of the gravitational moments, and is able,\ntherefore, to address the order one question of how deep the flows are given\nmeasurements of gravitational moments. The additional terms are significantly\nsmaller and none of these terms is dominant, so any approximation attempting to\nimprove over the simplified thermal wind approach needs to include all other\nterms.\n", "  We present a new formulation of quantum holonomy theory, which is a candidate\nfor a non-perturbative and background independent theory of quantum gravity\ncoupled to matter and gauge degrees of freedom. The new formulation is based on\na Hilbert space representation of the QHD(M) algebra, which is generated by\nholonomy-diffeomorphisms on a 3-dimensional manifold and by canonical\ntranslation operators on the underlying configuration space over which the\nholonomy-diffeomorphisms form a non-commutative C*-algebra. A proof that the\nstate that generates the representation exist is left for later publications.\n", "  Natural oxidation is a common degradation mechanism of both mechanical and\nelectronic properties for most of the new two-dimensional materials. From\nanother perspective, controlled oxidation is an option to tune material\nproperties, expanding possibilities for real-world applications. Understanding\nthe electronic structure modifications induced by oxidation is highly desirable\nfor new materials like monolayer GeSe, which is a new candidate for\nnear-infrared photodetectors. By means of first-principles calculations, we\nstudy the influence of oxygen defects on the structure and electronic\nproperties of the single layer GeSe. Our calculations show that the oxidation\nis an exothermic process, and it is nucleated in the germanium sites. The\noxidation can cause severe local deformations on the monolayer GeSe structure\nand introduces a deep state in the bandgap or a shallow state near the\nconduction band edge. Furthermore, the oxidation increases the bandgap by up to\n23 %, and may induce direct to indirect bandgap transitions. These results\nsuggest that the natural or intentionally induced monolayer GeSe oxidation can\nbe a source of new optoelectronic properties, adding another important building\nblock to the two-dimensional layered materials.\n", "  Determining the size and orbital distribution of the population of near-Earth\nasteroids (NEAs) is the focus of intense research, with the most recent models\nconverging to a population of approximately $1000$ NEAs larger than 1 km and up\nto approximately $10^9$ NEAs with absolute magnitude $H<30$. We present an\nanalysis of the combined observations of nine of the leading asteroid surveys\nover the past two decades, and show that for an absolute magnitude $H<17.75$,\nwhich is often taken as proxy for an average diameter larger than 1 km, the\npopulation of NEAs is $920\\pm10$, lower than other recent estimates. The\npopulation of small NEAs is estimated at $(4 \\pm 1)\\times 10^8$ for $H<30$, and\nthe number of decameter NEAs is lower than other recent estimates. This\npopulation tracks accurately the orbital distribution of recently discovered\nlarge NEAs, and produces an estimated Earth impact rate for small NEAs in good\nagreement with the bolide data.\n", "  Electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) in a ladder system involving a\nRydberg level is known to yield giant optical nonlinearities for the probe\nfield, even in the few-photon regime. This enhancement is due to the strong\ndipole-dipole interactions between Rydberg atoms and the resulting excitation\nblockade phenomenon. In order to study such highly correlated media, ad hoc\nmodels or low-excitation assumptions are generally used to tackle their\ndynamical response to optical fields. Here, we study the behaviour of a cavity\nRydberg-EIT setup in the non-equilibrium quantum field formalism, and we obtain\nanalytic expressions for elastic and inelastic components of the cavity\ntransmission spectrum, valid up to higher excitation numbers than previously\nachieved. This allows us to identify and interpret a polaritonic resonance\nstructure, to our knowledge unreported so far.\n", "  We present an intrinsic leptogenesis mechanism in models of axion inflation\nwith a classical SU(2) gauge field. The gauge field is coupled to the axion\nwith a Chern-Simons interaction and comprises a tiny fraction of the total\nenergy, $\\frac{\\rho_{_{\\rm YM}}}{\\rho_{_{\\rm tot}}}\\lesssim\\epsilon^2$.\nHowever, it has spin-2 fluctuations which breaks the parity and leads to the\ngeneration of chiral gravitational waves during inflation. By the gravitational\nanomaly in SM, it naturally creates a net lepton number density, sufficient to\nexplain the matter asymmetry. We show that this mechanism can generate the\nobserved value of baryon to photon number density in a natural range of\nparameters and yet has a small chiral tensor power spectrum on large scales.\n", "  The Bargmann-Michel-Telegdi equations describing the motions of a spinning,\ncharged, relativistic particle endowed with an anomalous magnetic moment in an\nelectromagnetic field, are reconsidered. They are shown to duly stem from the\nlinearization of the characteristic distribution of a pre-symplectic structure\nrefining the original one of Souriau. In this model, once specialized to the\ncase of a static electric-like field, the angular momentum and energy given by\nthe associated moment map now correctly restore the spin-orbit coupling term.\nThis is the state-of-the-art of unfinished joint work with Raymond Stora.\n", "  We investigate the effect of the inverse magnetic catalysis (IMC) on the\ncharged $\\rho$ meson condensation at finite temperature in the framework of the\nNambu--Jona-Lasinio model, where mesons are calculated to the leading order of\n$1/N_c$ expansion by summing up infinity quark-loops. IMC for chiral condensate\nhas been considered in three different ways, i.e. fitting Lattice data, using\nthe running coupling constant and introducing the chiral chemical potential,\nrespectively. It is observed that, with no IMC effect included, the critical\nmagnetic field $eB_c$ for charged $\\rho$ condensation increases monotonically\nwith the temperature. However, including IMC substantially affects the\npolarized charged $\\rho$ condensation around the critical temperature $T_c$ of\nchiral phase transition, the critical magnetic field $eB_c$ for charged $\\rho$\ncondensation decreases with the temperature firstly, reaches to a minimum value\naround $T_c$, then increases with the temperature. Our calculation indicates\nthat the charged $\\rho$ condensation can exist in the temperature region of\n$1-1.5 T_c$ with critical magnetic field $eB_c\\sim 0.15-0.3 {\\rm GeV}^2$, which\nsuggests that high temperature superconductor might be created through\nnon-central heavy ion collisions at LHC energies. We also show that a growing\nelectric conductivity in early stage of non-central heavy-ion collisions\nsubstantially delays the decay of strong magnetic field, which is helpful for\nthe formation of the high temperature superconductor.\n", "  We report on a new version of FeynCalc, a well-known Mathematica package for\nsymbolic computations in quantum field theory and provide some explicit\nexamples for using the software in different types of calculations.\n", "  The residual symmetry approach, along with a complex extension for some\nflavor invariance, is a powerful tool to uncover the flavor structure of the\n$3\\times3$ neutrino Majorana mass matrix $M_\\nu$ towards gaining insights into\nneutrino mixing. We utilize this to propose a complex extension of the real\nscaling ansatz for $M_\\nu$ which was introduced some years ago. Unlike the\nlatter, our proposal allows a nonzero mass for each of the three light\nneutrinos as well as a nonvanishing $\\theta_{13}$. A major result of this\nscheme is that leptonic Dirac CP-violation must be maximal while atmospheric\nneutrino mixing need not be exactly maximal. Moreover, each of the two allowed\nMajorana phases, to be probed by the search for nuclear $0\\nu \\beta\\beta$\ndecay, has to be at one of its two CP-conserving values. There are other\ninteresting consequences such as the allowed occurrence of a normal mass\nordering which is not favored by the real scaling ansatz. Our predictions will\nbe tested in ongoing and future neutrino oscillation experiments at T2K,\nNO$\\nu$A and DUNE.\n", "  It has been recently conjectured that the spectral determinants of operators\nassociated to mirror curves can be expressed in terms of a generalization of\ntheta functions, called quantum theta functions. In this paper we study the\nsymplectic properties of these spectral determinants by expanding them around\nthe point hbar=2pi, where the quantum theta functions become conventional theta\nfunctions. We find that they are modular invariant, order by order, and we give\nexplicit expressions for the very first terms of the expansion. Our derivation\nrequires a detailed understanding of the modular properties of topological\nstring free energies in the Nekrasov-Shatashvili limit. We derive these\nproperties in a diagrammatic form. Finally, we use our results to provide a new\ntest of the duality between topological strings and spectral theory.\n", "  We consider the dynamics of a reaction-diffusion system on a multigraph. The\nspecies share the same set of nodes but can access different links to explore\nthe embedding spatial support. By acting on the topology of the networks we can\ncontrol the ability of the system to self-organise in macroscopic patterns,\nemerging as a symmetry breaking instability of an homogeneous fixed point. Two\ndifferent cases study are considered: on the one side, we produce a global\nmodification of the networks, starting from the limiting setting where species\nare hosted on the same graph. On the other, we consider the effect of inserting\njust one additional single link to differentiate the two graphs. In both cases,\npatterns can be generated or destroyed, as follows the imposed, small,\ntopological perturbation. Approximate analytical formulae allows to grasp the\nessence of the phenomenon and can potentially inspire innovative control\nstrategies to shape the macroscopic dynamics on multigraph networks\n", "  Filters that act by adsorbing contaminant onto their pore walls will\nexperience a decrease in porosity over time, and may eventually block. As\nadsorption will generally be larger towards the entrance of a filter, where the\nconcentration of contaminant particles is higher, these effects can also result\nin a spatially varying porosity. We investigate this dynamic process using an\nextension of homogenization theory that accounts for a macroscale variation in\nmicrostructure. We formulate and homogenize the coupled problems of flow\nthrough a filter with a near-periodic time-dependent microstructure, solute\ntransport due to advection, diffusion, and filter adsorption, and filter\nstructure evolution due to the adsorption of contaminant. We use the\nhomogenized equations to investigate how the contaminant removal and filter\nlifespan depend on the initial porosity distribution for a unidirectional flow.\nWe confirm a conjecture made in Dalwadi et al. (2015) that filters with an\ninitially negative porosity gradient have a longer lifespan and remove more\ncontaminant than filters with an initially constant porosity, or worse, an\ninitially positive porosity gradient. Additionally, we determine which initial\nporosity distributions result in a filter that will block everywhere at once by\nexploiting an asymptotic reduction of the homogenized equations. We show that\nthese filters remove more contaminant than other filters with the same initial\naverage porosity, but that filters which block everywhere at once are limited\nby how large their initial average porosity can be.\n", "  With the advent of the space missions CoRoT and Kepler, it has become\nfeasible to determine precise asteroseismic masses and ages for large samples\nof red-giant stars. In this paper, we present the CoRoGEE dataset -- obtained\nfrom CoRoT lightcurves for 606 red giant stars in two fields of the Galactic\ndisc which have been co-observed for an ancillary project of APOGEE. We have\nused the Bayesian parameter estimation code PARAM to calculate distances,\nextinctions, masses, and ages for these stars in a homogeneous analysis,\nresulting in relative statistical uncertainties of $\\sim2\\%$ in distance,\n$\\sim4\\%$ in radius, $\\sim9\\%$ in mass and $\\sim25\\%$ in age. We also assess\nsystematic age uncertainties due to different input physics and mass loss. We\ndiscuss the correlation between ages and chemical abundance patterns of field\nstars over a large radial range of the Milky Way's disc (5 kpc $<R_{\\rm Gal}<$\n14 kpc), focussing on the [$\\alpha$/Fe]-[Fe/H]-age plane in five radial bins of\nthe Galactic disc. We find an overall agreement with the expectations of\nchemical-evolution models computed before the present data were available,\nespecially for the outer regions. However, our data also indicate that a\nsignificant fraction of stars now observed near and beyond the Solar\nNeighbourhood migrated from inner regions. Mock CoRoGEE observations of a\nchemo-dynamical Milky Way disc model show that the number of high-metallicity\nstars in the outer disc is too high to be accounted for even by the strong\nradial mixing present in the model. The mock observations also reveal that the\nage distribution of the [$\\alpha$/Fe]-enhanced sequence in the CoRoGEE\ninner-disc field is much broader than expected from a combination of radial\nmixing and observational errors. We suggest that a thick disc/bulge component\nthat formed stars for more than 3 Gyr may account for these discrepancies.\n", "  [Background] Besides its intrinsic value as a fundamental nuclear-structure\nobservable, the weak-charge density of 208Pb - a quantity that is closely\nrelated to its neutron distribution - is of fundamental importance in\nconstraining the equation of state of neutron-rich matter.\n  [Purpose] To assess the impact that a second electroweak measurement of the\nweak-charge form factor of 208Pb may have on the determination of its overall\nweak-charge density.\n  [Methods] Using the two putative experimental values of the form factor,\ntogether with a simple implementation of Bayes' theorem, we calibrate a\ntheoretically sound - yet surprisingly little known - symmetrized Fermi\nfunction, that is characterized by a density and form factor that are both\nknown exactly in closed form.\n  [Results] Using the charge form factor of 208Pb as a proxy for its\nweak-charge form factor, we demonstrate that using only two experimental points\nto calibrate the symmetrized Fermi function is sufficient to accurately\nreproduce the experimental charge form factor over a significant range of\nmomentum transfers.\n  [Conclusions] It is demonstrated that a second measurement of the weak-charge\nform factor of 208Pb supplemented by a robust theoretical input in the form of\nthe symmetrized Fermi function, would place significant constraints on the\nneutron distribution of 208Pb and, ultimately, on the equation of state of\nneutron-rich matter.\n", "  Hypothetical models have been proposed in which explicit collapse mechanisms\nprevent the superposition principle to hold at large scales. In particular, the\nmodel introduced by Ellis and co-workers [Phys. Lett. B ${\\bf 221}$, 113\n(1989)] suggests that quantum gravity might be responsible for the collapse of\nthe wavefunction of massive objects in spatial superpositions. We here consider\na recent experiment reporting on interferometry with atoms delocalized over\nhalf a meter for timescale of a second [Nature ${\\bf 528}$, 530 (2015)] and\nshow that the corresponding data strongly bound quantum gravity induced\ndecoherence and rule it out in the parameter regime considered originally.\n", "  Here we consider a contribution of Delta(1232) resonance to real photon\nradiative corrections for elastic $ep$-scattering. The effect is found to be\nsmall for past experiments to study unpolarized cross section as well as for\nthe recent VEPP-3 experiment to investigate two-photon exchange effects by\nprecision measurement of $e^\\pm p$-scattering cross sections ratio.\n", "  Scattering of light by matter has been studied extensively in the past. Yet,\nthe most fundamental process, the scattering of a single photon by a single\natom, is largely unexplored [1-3]. One prominent prediction of quantum optics\nis the deterministic absorption of a traveling photon by a single atom,\nprovided the photon waveform matches spatially and temporally the time-reversed\nversion of a spontaneously emitted photon [4-12]. Here, we experimentally\naddress this prediction and investigate the influence of the temporal profile\nof the photon on the scattering dynamics using a single trapped atom and\nheralded single photons. In a time-resolved measurement of the atomic\nexcitation we find a 56(11)% increase of the peak excitation by photons with an\nexponentially rising profile compared to a decaying one. This result\ndemonstrates that tailoring the envelope of single photons enables precise\ncontrol of the photon-atom interaction.\n", "  A novel nonlinear feedback control design methodology for incompressible\nfluid flows aiming at the optimisation of long-time averages of flow quantities\nis presented. It applies to reduced-order finite-dimensional models of fluid\nflows, expressed as a set of first-order nonlinear ordinary differential\nequations with the right-hand side being a polynomial function in the state\nvariables and in the controls. The key idea, first discussed in Chernyshenko et\nal. 2014, Philos. T. Roy. Soc. 372(2020), is that the difficulties of treating\nand optimising long-time averages of a cost are relaxed by using the\nupper/lower bounds of such averages as the objective function. In this setting,\ncontrol design reduces to finding a feedback controller that optimises the\nbound, subject to a polynomial inequality constraint involving the cost\nfunction, the nonlinear system, the controller itself and a tunable polynomial\nfunction. A numerically tractable approach to the solution of such optimisation\nproblems, based on Sum-of-Squares techniques and semidefinite programming, is\nproposed.\n  To showcase the methodology, the mitigation of the fluctuation kinetic energy\nin the unsteady wake behind a circular cylinder in the laminar regime at\nRe=100, via controlled angular motions of the surface, is numerically\ninvestigated. A compact reduced-order model that resolves the long-term\nbehaviour of the fluid flow and the effects of actuation, is derived using\nProper Orthogonal Decomposition and Galerkin projection. In a full-information\nsetting, feedback controllers are then designed to reduce the long-time average\nof the kinetic energy associated with the limit cycle. These controllers are\nthen implemented in direct numerical simulations of the actuated flow. Control\nperformance, energy efficiency, and physical control mechanisms identified are\nanalysed. Key elements, implications and future work are discussed.\n", "  The formation of high-order Bessel beams by a passive acoustic device\nconsisting of an Archimedes' spiral diffraction grating is theoretically,\nnumerically and experimentally reported in this work. These beams are\npropagation-invariant solutions of the Helmholtz equation and are characterized\nby an azimuthal variation of the phase along its annular spectrum producing an\nacoustic vortex in the near field. In our system, the scattering of plane\nacoustic waves by the spiral grating leads to the formation of the acoustic\nvortex with zero pressure on-axis and the angular phase dislocations\ncharacterized by the spiral geometry. The order of the generated Bessel beam\nand, as a consequence, the size of the generated vortex can be fixed by the\nnumber of arms in the spiral diffraction grating. The obtained results allow to\nobtain Bessel beams with controllable vorticity by a passive device, which has\npotential applications in low-cost acoustic tweezers and acoustic radiation\nforce devices.\n", "  Asymptotic expressions for the radial and full wave functions of a three{body\nbound halo nuclear system with two charged particles in relative coordinates\nare obtained in explicit form, when the relative distance between two particles\ntends to infinity. The obtained asymptotic forms are applied to the analysis of\nthe asymptotic behavior of the three-body (pn?) wave functions for the halo\n($E^*=3.562$ MeV, $J^{\\pi}=0^+$, $T=1$) state of $^6$Li derived by D. Baye\nwithin the Lagrange-mesh method for two forms of the $\\alpha N$ -potential. The\nagreement between the calculated wave function and the asymptotic formula is\nexcellent for distances up to 30 fm. Information about the values of the\nthree-body asymptotic normalization functions is extracted. It is shown that\nthe extracted values of the three-body asymptotic normalization function are\nsensitive to the form of the $\\alpha N$ -potential. The mirror symmetry is\nrevealed for the three-body asymptotic normalization functions derived for the\nisobaric ($^6$He, $^6$Li) pair.\n", "  Highlights of news from Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) and results from\nthe Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) in the period July 2014-June 2015\nare presented. The news this year was mostly very positive. The major event at\nBNL was the startup and dedication of the new NSLS II, \"the World's brightest\nSynchrotron Light Source\". The operation of RHIC was outstanding with a\npolarized p+p run at $\\sqrt{s}=200$ GeV with integrated luminosity that\nexceeded the sum of all previous p+p integrated luminosity at this $\\sqrt{s}$.\nFor the first time at RHIC asymmetric p+Au and p+Al runs were made but the p+Al\nrun caused damage in the PHENIX forward detectors from quenches that were\ninadequately shielded for this first p+A run. This was also the 10th\nanniversary of the 2005 announcement of the Perfect Liquid Quark Gluon Plasma\nat RHIC and a review is presented of the discoveries leading to this claim. A\nnew result on net-charge fluctuations (with no particle identification) from\nPHENIX based on previous scans over beam energy to look for a QCD critical\npoint is discussed which combined with Lattice QCD calculations and smaller\nerrors on the higher cumulants than previous measurements led to calculations\nof the baryon chemical potential and freezeout temperature in agreement with\nthe best accepted analysis from baryon/anti-baryon ratio measurements.\n", "  We investigated the vibrational dynamics and the structural relaxation of\nwater nanoconfined in porous silica samples with pore size of 4 nm at different\nlevels of hydration and temperature. We used as spectroscopic technique the\ntime-resolved optical Kerr effect, which enables to investigate the ultrafast\nwater dynamics in a wide time (0.1-10 picosecond) or frequency (10-0.1 THz)\nwindow. At low levels of hydration, corresponding to two complete superficial\nwater layers, no freezing occurs and the water remains mobile at all the\ninvestigated temperatures, while at the fully hydration we witness to a partial\nice formation at about 248 K that coexists with the part of surface water\nremaining in the supercooled state. At low hydration, both structural and\nvibrational dynamics show significant modifications compared to the bulk liquid\nwater due to the strong interaction of the water molecules with silica\nsurfaces. Inner water, instead, reveals relaxation dynamics very similar to the\nbulk one.\n", "  We present Forcer, a new FORM program for the calculation of four-loop\nmassless propagators. The basic framework is similar to that of the Mincer\nprogram for three-loop massless propagators: the program reduces Feynman\nintegrals to a set of master integrals in a parametric way. To overcome an\nineludible complexity of the program structure at the four-loop level, most of\nthe code was automatically generated or made with computer-assisted\nderivations. Correctness of the program has been checked with the recomputation\nof some quantities in the literature.\n", "  The marvelous Les Houches summer school of 1970 bore the trademark of Raymond\nStora.\n", "  Current 3D photoacoustic tomography (PAT) systems offer either high image\nquality or high frame rates but are not able to deliver high spatial and\ntemporal resolution simultaneously, which limits their ability to image dynamic\nprocesses in living tissue. A particular example is the planar Fabry-Perot (FP)\nscanner, which yields high-resolution images but takes several minutes to\nsequentially map the photoacoustic field on the sensor plane, point-by-point.\nHowever, as the spatio-temporal complexity of many absorbing tissue structures\nis rather low, the data recorded in such a conventional, regularly sampled\nfashion is often highly redundant. We demonstrate that combining variational\nimage reconstruction methods using spatial sparsity constraints with the\ndevelopment of novel PAT acquisition systems capable of sub-sampling the\nacoustic wave field can dramatically increase the acquisition speed while\nmaintaining a good spatial resolution: First, we describe and model two general\nspatial sub-sampling schemes. Then, we discuss how to implement them using the\nFP scanner and demonstrate the potential of these novel compressed sensing PAT\ndevices through simulated data from a realistic numerical phantom and through\nmeasured data from a dynamic experimental phantom as well as from in-vivo\nexperiments. Our results show that images with good spatial resolution and\ncontrast can be obtained from highly sub-sampled PAT data if variational image\nreconstruction methods that describe the tissues structures with suitable\nsparsity-constraints are used. In particular, we examine the use of total\nvariation regularization enhanced by Bregman iterations. These novel\nreconstruction strategies offer new opportunities to dramatically increase the\nacquisition speed of PAT scanners that employ point-by-point sequential\nscanning as well as reducing the channel count of parallelized schemes that use\ndetector arrays.\n", "  Climate models simulate a strong land-ocean contrast in the response of\nnear-surface relative humidity to global warming: relative humidity tends to\nincrease slightly over oceans but decrease substantially over land. Surface\nenergy balance arguments have been used to understand the response over ocean\nbut are difficult to apply over more complex land surfaces. Here, a conceptual\nbox model is introduced, involving moisture transport between the land and\nocean boundary layers and evapotranspiration, to investigate the decreases in\nland relative humidity as the climate warms. The box model is applied to\nidealized and full-complexity (CMIP5) general circulation model simulations,\nand it is found to capture many of the features of the simulated changes in\nland relative humidity. The box model suggests there is a strong link between\nfractional changes in specific humidity over land and ocean, and the greater\nwarming over land than ocean then implies a decrease in land relative humidity.\nEvapotranspiration is of secondary importance for the increase in specific\nhumidity over land, but it matters more for the decrease in relative humidity.\nFurther analysis shows there is a strong feedback between changes in\nsurface-air temperature and relative humidity, and this can amplify the\ninfluence on relative humidity of factors such as stomatal conductance and soil\nmoisture.\n", "  It was recently proposed to use the stray magnetic fields of superconducting\nvortex lattices to trap ultracold atoms for building quantum emulators. This\ncalls for new methods for engineering and manipulating of the vortex states.\nOne of the possible routes utilizes type-1.5 superconducting layered systems\nwith multi-scale inter-vortex interactions. In order to explore the possible\nvortex states that can be engineered, we present two phase diagrams of\nphenomenological vortex matter models with multi-scale inter-vortex\ninteractions featuring several attractive and repulsive length scales. The\nphase diagrams exhibit a plethora of phases, including conventional 2D lattice\nphases, five stripe phases, dimer, trimer, and tetramer phases, void phases,\nand stable low-temperature disordered phases. The transitions between these\nstates can be controlled by the value of an applied external field.\n", "  Dedicated optics with extremely short electron bunches enable synchrotron\nlight sources to generate intense coherent THz radiation. The high degree of\nspatial compression in this so-called low-alpha optics entails a complex\nlongitudinal dynamics of the electron bunches, which can be probed studying the\nfluctuations in the emitted terahertz radiation caused by the micro-bunching\ninstability (\"bursting\"). This article presents a \"quasi-instantaneous\" method\nfor measuring the bursting characteristics by simultaneously collecting and\nevaluating the information from all bunches in a multi-bunch fill, reducing the\nmeasurement time from hours to seconds. This speed-up allows systematic studies\nof the bursting characteristics for various accelerator settings within a\nsingle fill of the machine, enabling a comprehensive comparison of the measured\nbursting thresholds with theoretical predictions by the bunched-beam theory.\nThis paper introduces the method and presents first results obtained at the\nANKA synchrotron radiation facility.\n", "  Local diffusion coefficients in disordered systems such as spin glass systems\nand living cells are highly heterogeneous and may change over time. Such a\ntime-dependent and spatially heterogeneous environment results in\nirreproducibility of single-particle-tracking measurements. Irreproducibility\nof time-averaged observables has been theoretically studied in the context of\nweak ergodicity breaking in stochastic processes. Here, we provide rigorous\ndescriptions of equilibrium and non-equilibrium diffusion processes for the\nannealed transit time model, which is a heterogeneous diffusion model in living\ncells. We give analytical solutions for the mean square displacement (MSD) and\nthe relative standard deviation of the time-averaged MSD for equilibrium and\nnon-equilibrium situations. We find that the time-averaged MSD grows linearly\nwith time and that the diffusion coefficients are intrinsically random in\nnon-equilibrium situations. Our findings pave the way for a theoretical\nunderstanding of distributional behavior of the diffusion coefficients in\ndisordered systems.\n", "  In this paper, we investigated the process $pp \\to W^{-}hj$ induced by the\ntop-Higgs flavor changing neutral current (FCNC) couplings at the LHC. We found\nthat the cross section of $pp \\to W^{-}hj$ mainly comes from the resonant\nprocess $pp\\to W^{-}t\\to W^{-}hq$ due to the anomalous $tqH$ couplings (where\n$q$ denotes up and charm quarks). We further studied the observability of the\ntop-Higgs FCNC couplings through the process $pp \\to W^{-}(\\to \\ell^{-}\n\\bar{\\nu}_{\\ell}) h( \\to \\gamma\\gamma) j$ and found that the branching ratios\n$Br(t\\to qh)$ can be probed to $0.16\\%$ at $3\\sigma$ level at 14 TeV LHC with\nan integrated luminosity of 3000 fb$^{-1}$.\n", "  We formulate the integer factorization problem via a formulation of the\nsearching problem for the ground state of a statistical mechanical Hamiltonian.\nThe first passage time required to find a correct divisor of a composite number\nsignifies the exponential computational hard- ness. Analysis of the density of\nstates of two macroscopic quantities, i.e. the energy and the Hamming distance\nfrom the correct solutions, leads to the conclusion that the ground state (the\ncorrect solution) is completely isolated from the other low energy states, with\nthe distance being proportional to the system size. In addition, the profile of\nthe microcanonical entropy of the model has two peculiar features which are\neach related to two dramatic changes in the energy region sampled via Monte\nCarlo simulation or simulated annealing. Hence, we find a peculiar first-order\nphase transition in our model.\n", "  We perform a detailed study of the sources of perturbative uncertainty in\nparton shower predictions within the Herwig 7 event generator. We benchmark two\nrather different parton shower algorithms, based on angular-ordered and\ndipole-type evolution, against each other. We deliberately choose leading order\nplus parton shower as the benchmark setting to identify a controllable set of\nuncertainties. This will enable us to reliably assess improvements by\nhigher-order contributions in a follow-up work.\n", "  We present the first 3D simulation of the last minutes of oxygen shell\nburning in an 18 solar mass supernova progenitor up to the onset of core\ncollapse. A moving inner boundary is used to accurately model the contraction\nof the silicon and iron core according to a 1D stellar evolution model with a\nself-consistent treatment of core deleptonization and nuclear\nquasi-equilibrium. The simulation covers the full solid angle to allow the\nemergence of large-scale convective modes. Due to core contraction and the\nconcomitant acceleration of nuclear burning, the convective Mach number\nincreases to ~0.1 at collapse, and an l=2 mode emerges shortly before the end\nof the simulation. Aside from a growth of the oxygen shell from 0.51 to 0.56\nsolar masses due to entrainment from the carbon shell, the convective flow is\nreasonably well described by mixing length theory, and the dominant scales are\ncompatible with estimates from linear stability analysis. We deduce that\nartificial changes in the physics, such as accelerated core contraction, can\nhave precarious consequences for the state of convection at collapse. We argue\nthat scaling laws for the convective velocities and eddy sizes furnish good\nestimates for the state of shell convection at collapse and develop a simple\nanalytic theory for the impact of convective seed perturbations on shock\nrevival in the ensuing supernova. We predict a reduction of the critical\nluminosity for explosion by 12--24% due to seed asphericities for our 3D\nprogenitor model relative to the case without large seed perturbations.\n", "  We studied pairing mechanism of the heavily electron doped FeSe (HEDIS)\nsystems, which commonly have one incipient hole band -- a band top below the\nFermi level by a finite energy distance $\\epsilon_b$ -- at $\\Gamma$ point and\nordinary electron bands at $M$ points in Brillouin zone (BZ). We found that the\nsystem allows two degenerate superconducting solutions with the exactly same\n$T_c$ in clean limit: the incipient $s^{\\pm}_{he}$-gap ($\\Delta_h^{-} \\neq 0$,\n$\\Delta_e^{+} \\neq 0$) and $s_{ee}^{++}$-gap ($\\Delta_h =0$, $\\Delta_e^{+} \\neq\n0$) solutions with different pairing cutoffs, $\\Lambda_{sf}$ (spin fluctuation\nenergy) and $\\epsilon_b$, respectively. The $s_{ee}^{++}$-gap solution, in\nwhich the system dynamically renormalizes the original pairing cutoff\n$\\Lambda_{sf}$ to $\\Lambda_{phys}=\\epsilon_b$ ($< \\Lambda_{sf}$), therefore\nactively eliminates the incipient hole band from forming Cooper pairs, but\nwithout loss of $T_c$, becomes immune to the impurity pair-breaking. As a\nresult, the HEDIS systems, by dynamically tuning the pairing cutoff and\nselecting the $s_{ee}^{++}$-pairing state, can always achieve the maximum $T_c$\n-- the $T_c$ of the degenerate $s^{\\pm}_{he}$ solution in the ideal clean limit\n-- latent in the original pairing interactions, even in dirty limit.\n", "  We report a systematic study of charge distribution dependency of CMS\nResistive Plate Chamber (RPC) on gap thickness. Prototypes of double-gap RPCs\nwith six different gap thickness ranging from from 1.0 to 2.0 mm in 0.2-mm\nsteps have been built with 2-mm-thick phenolic high-pressure-laminated plates.\nThe efficiencies of the six gaps are measured as a function of the effective\nhigh voltages. We report that the strength of the electric fields of the gap is\ndecreased as the gap thickness is increased. The distributions of charges in\nsix gaps are measured. The space charge effect is seen in the charge\ndistribution at the higher voltages. The logistic function is used to fit the\ncharge distribution data. Smaller charges can be produced within smaller gas\ngap. But the digitization threshold should be also lowered to utilize these\nsmaller charges.\n", "  We review some of the modern approaches to scattering amplitude computations\nin QCD and their application to precision LHC phenomenology. We emphasise the\nusefulness of momentum twistor variables in parameterising general amplitudes.\n", "  Dynamics of coupled chaotic oscillators on a network are studied using\ncoupled maps. Within a broad range of parameter values representing the\ncoupling strength or the degree of elements, the system repeats formation and\nsplit of coherent clusters. The distribution of the cluster size follows a\npower law with the exponent $\\alpha$, which changes with the parameter values.\nThe number of positive Lyapunov exponents and their spectra are scaled\nanomalously with the power of the system size with the exponent $\\beta$, which\nalso changes with the parameters. The scaling relation $\\alpha \\sim 2(\\beta\n+1)$ is uncovered, which seems to be universal independent of parameters and\nnetworks.\n", "  A combination of classical molecular dynamics (MM/MD) and quantum chemical\ncalculations based on the density functional theory (DFT) was performed to\ndescribe conformational properties of diphenylethyne (DPE), methylated-DPE and\npoly para phenylene ethynylene (PPE). DFT calculations were employed to improve\nand develop force field parameters for MM/MD simulations. Many-body Green's\nfunctions theory within the GW approximation and the Bethe-Salpeter equation\nwere utilized to describe excited states of the systems. Reliability of the\nexcitation energies based on the MM/MD conformations was examined and compared\nto the excitation energies from DFT conformations. The results show an overall\nagreement between the optical excitations based on MM/MD conformations and DFT\nconformations. This allows for calculation of excitation energies based on\nMM/MD conformations.\n", "  A combination of variable-temperature neutron scattering, reverse Monte Carlo\nanalysis and direct Monte Carlo simulation is used to characterise the\nemergence of magnetic order in the metal--organic framework (MOF) Tb(HCOO)$_3$\nover the temperature range 100 K to 1.6 K $=T_{\\rm N}$. We show that the\nmagnetic transition at $T_{\\rm N}$ involves one-dimensional ferromagnetic\nordering to a partially-ordered state related to the triangular Ising\nantiferromagnet. In this phase, the direction of magnetisation of ferromagnetic\nchains tends to alternate between neighbouring chains but this alternation is\nfrustrated and is not itself ordered. In neutron scattering measurements this\npartial order gives rise to Bragg-like peaks, which cannot be interpreted using\nconventional magnetic crystallography without resort to unphysical spin models.\nThe existence of low-dimensional magnetic order in Tb(HCOO)$_3$ is stabilised\nby the contrasting strength of inter- and intra-chain magnetic coupling, itself\na consequence of the underlying MOF architecture. Our results demonstrate how\nMOFs may provide an attractive if as yet under-explored platform for the\nrealisation and investigation of low-dimensional physics.\n", "  The concept of sequential visibility graph motifs -subgraphs appearing with\ncharacteristic frequencies in the visibility graphs associated to time series-\nhas been advanced recently along with a theoretical framework to compute\nanalytically the motif profiles associated to Horizontal Visibility Graphs\n(HVGs). Here we develop a theory to compute the profile of sequential\nvisibility graph motifs in the context of Natural Visibility Graphs (VGs). This\ntheory gives exact results for deterministic aperiodic processes with a smooth\ninvariant density or stochastic processes that fulfil the Markov property and\nhave a continuous marginal distribution. The framework also allows for a linear\ntime numerical estimation in the case of empirical time series. A comparison\nbetween the HVG and the VG case (including evaluation of their robustness for\nshort series polluted with measurement noise) is also presented.\n", "  We report a giant magnetocaloric effect near room temperature in an\noff-stoichiometric Mn-Co-Ge alloy, across the magnetostructural transition. The\nisothermal entropy change accompanying this transition has a peak value of\nnearly 40 J/kg-K near 297 K and a refrigerant capacity of 270 J/kg with the hot\nend at 302.5 K and cold end at 293.5 K. We also present an experimental\nprotocol to avoid spurious peaks in the magnetocaloric effect across a sharp\nfirst order magnetostructural transition, not confined to Mn-Co-Ge alone, where\nmetastability during the transition could influence the measured magnetization\nand thus the estimated entropy change. The estimated entropy change in the\npresent off-stoichiometric Mn-Co-Ge alloy is possibly the highest reported\nvalue near room temperature in undoped Mn-Co-Ge alloys and underlines the\npotential of the alloy for technological applications in room temperature\nmagnetic refrigeration.\n", "  In this study, we investigate the $J/\\psi$ production induced by pion beams\noff the nucleon, particularly the heavy pentaquarks $P_c(4380)$ and $P_c(4450)$\nin intermediate states, based on a hybridized Regge model. The process\ninvolving $\\rho$ and $\\pi$ meson exchange in the $t$ channel is considered as\nbackground, and the heavy pentaquark exchange is included in the $s$ channel.\nThe coupling constants such as the $\\rho NN$ and $\\pi NN$ vertices are taken\nfrom the $NN$ potentials, whereas those for the $J/\\psi\\rho\\pi$ and\n$J/\\psi\\pi\\pi$ vertices are determined by using experimental data based on the\nbranching ratios. In order to estimate the $P_c(4380)$ and $P_c(4450)$ coupling\nconstants, we use the experimental upper limit on the total cross section as a\nguide for the $\\pi N\\to J/\\psi N$ reaction. The background total cross section\nis the order of $10^{-4}-10^{-3}$ nb. In the vicinity of the heavy pentaquark\nmasses, the total cross section reaches about $1$ nb.\n", "  We study radiative capture reactions using quasi-separable potentials. This\nprocedure allows an easier treatment of non-local effects that can be extended\nto three-body problems. Using this technique, we calculate the neutron and\nproton radiative capture cross sections on $^{12}$C. The results obtained are\nshown to be in good agreement with the available experimental data.\n", "  The fermion self-energy is calculated for a cold QED plasma with chiral\nchemical potential in a magnetic field. It is found that a momentum shift\nparameter dynamically generated in such a plasma leads to a modification of the\nchiral magnetic effect current. It is argued that the momentum shift parameter\ncan be relevant for the evolution of magnetic field in the chirally asymmetric\nprimordial plasma in the early Universe.\n", "  The eta-deformation of the AdS_5 x S^5 superstring depends on a non-split r\nmatrix for the superalgebra psu(2,2|4). Much of the investigation into this\nmodel has considered one particular choice, however there are a number of\ninequivalent alternatives. This is also true for the bosonic sector of the\ntheory with su(2,2), the isometry algebra of AdS_5, admitting one split and\nthree non-split r matrices. In this article we explore these r matrices and the\ncorresponding geometries. We investigate their contraction limits, comment on\nsupergravity backgrounds and demonstrate their relation to gauged-WZW\ndeformations. We then extend the three non-split cases to AdS_5 x S^5 and\ncompute four separate bosonic two-particle tree-level S-matrices based on\ninequivalent BMN-type light-cone gauges. The resulting S-matrices, while\ndifferent, are related by momentum-dependent one-particle changes of basis.\n", "  The hierarchical nature of LCDM suggests that the Magellanic Clouds must have\nbeen surrounded by a number of satellites before their infall into the Milky\nWay. Many of those satellites should still be in close proximity to the Clouds,\nbut some could have dispersed ahead/behind the Clouds along their Galactic\norbit. Either way, prior association with the Clouds results in strong\nrestrictions on the present-day positions and velocities of candidate\nMagellanic satellites: they must lie close to the nearly-polar orbital plane of\nthe Magellanic stream, and their distances and radial velocities must follow\nthe latitude dependence expected for a tidal stream with the Clouds at\npericenter. We use a cosmological numerical simulation of the disruption of a\nmassive subhalo in a Milky Way-sized LCDM halo to test whether any of the 20\ndwarfs recently-discovered in the DES, SMASH, Pan-STARRS, and ATLAS surveys are\ntruly associated with the Clouds. Of the 6 systems with kinematic data, only\nHydra II and Hor 1 have distances and radial velocities consistent with a\nMagellanic origin. Of the remaining dwarfs, six (Hor 2, Eri 3, Ret 3, Tuc 4,\nTuc 5, and Phx 2) have positions and distances consistent with a Magellanic\norigin, but kinematic data are needed to substantiate that possibility.\nConclusive evidence for association would require proper motions to constrain\nthe orbital angular momentum direction, which, for true Magellanic satellites,\nmust coincide with that of the Clouds. We use this result to predict radial\nvelocities and proper motions for all new dwarfs. Our results are relatively\ninsensitive to the assumption of first or second pericenter for the Clouds.\n", "  A perturbative way to investigate superfluid properties of various systems\nunder nonuniform potential is presented. We derive the perturbation expansion\nof the superfluid fraction, which indicates how liquid exhibits nonclassical\nrotational inertia, in terms of the strength of nonuniform potential and find\nthat the coefficient of the leading term reflects the density fluctuation of\nthe system. Our formulation does not assume anything about Bose-Einstein\ncondensation and thus is applicable to wide variety of systems. Superfluid\nproperties of some examples including (non-)interacting Bose systems,\nespecially Bose gas in the mean field limit, (non-)interacting Fermi sytems,\nTomonaga-Luttinger liquid and spinless chiral $p$-wave superfluid are\ninvestigated.\n", "  We derive the analog of the large $N$ Gross-Taylor holomorphic string\nexpansion for the refinement of $q$-deformed $U(N)$ Yang-Mills theory on a\ncompact oriented Riemann surface. The derivation combines Schur-Weyl duality\nfor quantum groups with the Etingof-Kirillov theory of generalized quantum\ncharacters which are related to Macdonald polynomials. In the unrefined limit\nwe reproduce the chiral expansion of $q$-deformed Yang-Mills theory derived by\nde Haro, Ramgoolam and Torrielli. In the classical limit $q=1$, the expansion\ndefines a new $\\beta$-deformation of Hurwitz theory wherein the refined\npartition function is a generating function for certain parameterized Euler\ncharacters, which reduce in the unrefined limit $\\beta=1$ to the orbifold Euler\ncharacteristics of Hurwitz spaces of holomorphic maps. We discuss the\ngeometrical meaning of our expansions in relation to quantum spectral curves\nand $\\beta$-ensembles of matrix models arising in refined topological string\ntheory.\n", "  The deformation of a viscous liquid droplet suspended in another liquid and\nsubject to an applied electric field is a classic multiphase flow problem best\ndescribed by the Melcher-Taylor leaky dielectric model. The main assumption of\nthe model is that any net charge in the system is concentrated on the interface\nbetween the two liquids as a result of the jump in Ohmic currents from the\nbulk. Upon application of the field, the drop can either attain a steady\nprolate or oblate shape with toroidal circulating flows both inside and outside\narising from tangential stresses on the interface due to action of the field on\nthe surface charge distribution. Since the pioneering work of\n\\cite{taylor1966}, there have been numerous computational and theoretical\nstudies to predict the deformations measured in experiments. Most existing\ntheoretical models, however, have either neglected transient charge relaxation\nor nonlinear charge convection by the interfacial flow. In this work, we\ndevelop a novel small-deformation theory accurate to second order in electric\ncapillary number ${O}(Ca_E^2)$ for the complete Melcher-Taylor model that\nincludes transient charge relaxation, charge convection by the flow, as well as\ntransient shape deformation. The main result of the paper is the derivation of\ncoupled evolution equations for the induced electric multipoles and for the\nshape functions describing the deformations on the basis of spherical\nharmonics. Our results, which are consistent with previous models in the\nappropriate limits, show excellent agreement with fully nonlinear numerical\nsimulations based on an axisymmetric boundary-element formulation and with\nexisting experimental data in the small-deformation regime.\n", "  We have developed a novel technique for detection of spin polarization with a\nquantum dot weakly coupled to the objective device. The disturbance to the\nobject in this technique is very small since the detection is performed through\nsampling of single electrons in the object with very slow rate. We have applied\nthe method to a quantum point contact (QPC) under a spin-orbit interaction. A\nhigh degree of spin polarization in the vicinity of the QPC was detected when\nthe conductance stayed on a plateau at a half of the unit conductance quantum\n($G_{\\rm q}/2\\equiv e^2/h$), and also on another plateau at $2e^2/h$. On the\nhalf-quantum plateau, the degree of polarization $P$ decreased with the bias\nsource-drain voltage of the QPC while $P$ increased on the single-quantum\nplateau, manifesting that different mechanisms of polarization were working on\nthese plateaus. Very long spin relaxation times in the detector quantum dot\nprobably due to dynamical nuclear spin polarization were observed. Anomalous\ndecrease of $P$ around zero-bias was observed at a Kondo-like resonance peak.\n", "  At hard X-ray energies, the bright footpoint emission from solar flare loops\noften prevents a detailed analysis of the weaker loop-top source morphology due\nto the limited dynamic range available for X-ray imaging. Here, we study the\nX1.3 April 25, 2014 flare with the Reuven Ramaty High-Energy Solar\nSpectroscopic Imager (RHESSI). This partially occulted limb flare allows the\nanalysis of the loop-top emission in isolation. We present results on the flare\nlight curve at different energies, the source morphology from X-ray imaging and\na detailed spectral analysis of the different source components by imaging\nspectroscopy. The loop-top source, a likely site of particle acceleration,\nshows a clear composition of different emission components. The results\nindicate the opportunities that detailed imaging of hard X-rays can provide to\nlearn about particle acceleration, transport and heating processes in solar\nflares.\n", "  A high purity and large volume NaI(Tl) scintillator was developed to search\nfor cosmic dark matter. The required densities of radioactive impurities (RIs)\nsuch as U-chain, Th-chain are less than a few ppt to establish high sensitivity\nto dark matter. The impurity of RIs were effectively reduced by selecting raw\nmaterials of crucible and by performing chemical reduction of lead ion in NaI\nraw powder. The impurity of $^{226}$Ra was reduced less than 100 $\\mu$Bq/kg in\nNaI(Tl) crystal. It should be remarked that the impurity of $^{210}$Pb, which\nis difficult to reduce, is effectively reduced by chemical processing of NaI\nraw powder down to less than 30 $\\mu$Bq/kg. The expected sensitivity to cosmic\ndark matter by using 250 kg of the high purity and large volume NaI(Tl)\nscintillator (PICO-LON; Pure Inorganic Crystal Observatory for LOw-background\nNeutr(al)ino) is 7$\\times$10$^{-45}$ cm$^{2}$ for 50 GeV$/c^{2}$ WIMPs.\n", "  We report a neutron diffraction study of the multiferroic mechanism in\n(ND4)2FeCl5D2O, a molecular compound that exhibits magnetically induced\nferroelectricity. This material exhibits two successive magnetic transitions on\ncooling: a long-range order transition to an incommensurate (IC) collinear\nsinusoidal spin state at TN=7.3 K, followed by a second transition to an IC\ncycloidal spin state at TFE=6.8 K, the later of which is accompanied by\nspontaneous ferroelectric polarization. The cycloid structure is strongly\ndistorted by spin-lattice coupling as evidenced by the observations of both odd\nand even higher-order harmonics associated with the cycloid wave vector, and a\nweak commensurate phase that coexists with the IC phase. The appearance of the\n2nd-order harmonic coincides with the onset of the electric polarization,\nthereby providing unambiguous evidence that the induced electric polarization\nis mediated by the spin-lattice interaction. Our results for this system, in\nwhich the orbital angular momentum is expected to be quenched, are remarkably\nsimilar to those of the prototypical TbMnO3, in which the magnetoelectric\neffect is attributed to spin-orbit coupling.\n", "  We show that there cannot exist a straightforward generalization of the\nfamous positive partial transpose criterion to three-by-three systems. We call\nstraightforward generalizations that use a finite set of positive maps and\narbitrary local rotations of the tested two-partite state. In particular, we\nshow that a family of extreme positive maps discussed in a paper by Ha and Kye,\ncannot be replaced by a finite set of witnesses in the task of entanglement\ndetection in three-by-three systems. In a more mathematically elegant parlance,\nour result says that the convex cone of positive maps of the set of\nthree-dimensional matrices into itself is not finitely generated as a mapping\ncone\n", "  In this work we apply entropic sampling simulations to a three-state model\nwhich has exact solutions in the microcanonical and grand-canonical ensembles.\nWe consider $N$ chains placed on an unidimensional lattice, such that each site\nmay assume one of three-states: empty (state 1), with a single molecule\nenergetically null (state 2), and with a single molecule with energy\n$\\varepsilon$ (state 3). Each molecule, which we will treat here as dimers,\nconsists of two monomers connected one to each other by a rod. The\nthermodynamic properties, such as internal energy, densities of dimers and\nspecific heat were obtained as functions of temperature where the analytic\nresults in the micro-canonical and grand-canonical ensembles were successfully\nconfirmed by the entropic sampling simulations.\n", "  Coset methods are used to determine the action of a co-dimension one brane\n(domain wall) embedded in (d+1)-dimensional AdS space in the Carroll limit in\nwhich the speed of light goes to zero. The action is invariant under the\nnon-linearly realized symmetries of the AdS-Carroll spacetime. The\nNambu-Goldstone field exhibits a static spatial distribution for the brane with\na time varying momentum density related to the brane's spatial shape as well as\nthe AdS-C geometry. The AdS-C vector field dual theory is obtained.\n", "  Power density constraints are limiting the performance improvements of modern\nCPUs. To address this we have seen the introduction of lower-power, multi-core\nprocessors such as GPGPU, ARM and Intel MIC. To stay within the power density\nlimits but still obtain Moore's Law performance/price gains, it will be\nnecessary to parallelize algorithms to exploit larger numbers of lightweight\ncores and specialized functions like large vector units. Track finding and\nfitting is one of the most computationally challenging problems for event\nreconstruction in particle physics. At the High-Luminosity Large Hadron\nCollider (HL-LHC), for example, this will be by far the dominant problem. The\nneed for greater parallelism has driven investigations of very different track\nfinding techniques such as Cellular Automata or Hough Transforms. The most\ncommon track finding techniques in use today, however, are those based on the\nKalman Filter. Significant experience has been accumulated with these\ntechniques on real tracking detector systems, both in the trigger and offline.\nThey are known to provide high physics performance, are robust, and are in use\ntoday at the LHC. We report on porting these algorithms to new parallel\narchitectures. Our previous investigations showed that, using optimized data\nstructures, track fitting with a Kalman Filter can achieve large speedups both\nwith Intel Xeon and Xeon Phi. Additionally, we have previously shown first\nattempts at track building with some speedup. We report here our progress\ntowards an end-to-end track reconstruction algorithm fully exploiting\nvectorization and parallelization techniques in a simplified experimental\nenvironment.\n", "  Single photon avalanche diodes (SPADs) are the most commercially diffused\nsolution for single-photon counting in quantum key distribution (QKD)\napplications. However, the secondary photon emission, arising from the\navalanche of charge carriers during a photon detection, may be exploited by an\neavesdropper to gain information without forcing errors in the transmission\nkey. In this paper, we characterise such backflash light in gated InGaAs/InP\nSPADs, and its spectral and temporal characterization for different detector\nmodels and different operating parameters. We qualitatively bound the maximum\ninformation leakage due to backflash light, and propose a solution.\n", "  We study the interaction of dielectric rods and disks with the laser field of\na high finesse cavity. The quantum master equation for the coupled\nparticle-cavity dynamics, including Rayleigh scattering, is derived for\nparticle sizes comparable to the laser wavelength. We demonstrate that such\nanisotropic nanoparticles can be captured from free flight at velocities higher\nthan those required to capture dielectric spheres of the same volume, and that\nefficient ro-translational cavity cooling into the deep quantum regime is\nachievable.\n", "  We study D3-instanton corrections to the hypermultiplet moduli space in type\nIIB string theory compactified on a Calabi-Yau threefold. In a previous work,\nconsistency of D3-instantons with S-duality was established at first order in\nthe instanton expansion, using the modular properties of the M5-brane elliptic\ngenus. We extend this analysis to the two-instanton level, where wall-crossing\nphenomena start playing a role. We focus on the contact potential, an analogue\nof the Kahler potential which must transform as a modular form under S-duality.\nWe show that it can be expressed in terms of a suitable modification of the\npartition function of D4-D2-D0 BPS black holes, constructed out of the\ngenerating function of MSW invariants (the latter coincide with\nDonaldson-Thomas invariants in a particular chamber). Modular invariance of the\ncontact potential then requires that, in case where the D3-brane wraps a\nreducible divisor, the generating function of MSW invariants must transform as\na vector-valued mock modular form, with a specific modular completion built\nfrom the MSW invariants of the constituents. Physically, this gives a powerful\nconstraint on the degeneracies of BPS black holes. Mathematically, our result\ngives a universal prediction for the modular properties of Donaldson-Thomas\ninvariants of pure two-dimensional sheaves.\n", "  In order to ensure the fastest wireless energy transfer from a source to the\nuser one needs to maximize the channel capacity for power transport. In\ncommunications technologies, the concept of MIMO (multiple input, multiple\noutput) exploits the idea of sending signals via many different rays which may\nreach the receiver. However, if we are concerned with the task of energy\ntransfer, still only one mode is exploited, even if multiple antennas are used\nto send power to the receiver. In the near-field scenario, this is the magnetic\ndipole mode of receiving coil antennas. In the far-field scenario, this is the\npropagating plane wave TEM mode. Recently, it was shown that using special\nartificial materials it is possible to ensure that all electromagnetic modes of\nfree space are conjugately matched to the modes of a material body and, thus,\nall modes deliver power to the body in the most effective way. Such a\nfascinating feature is acquired because the conjugate matching does not concern\nonly the propagating modes but, most importantly, is applied to all evanescent\nmodes. However, coupling to higher-order (mostly evanescent) modes is weak and\ndisappears in the limit of an infinite planar boundary. We show that properly\nperturbing the surface of the receiving or emitting body with, for example,\nrandomly distributed small particles we can open up channels for\nsuper-radiation into far zone. The currents induced in the small particles act\nas secondary sources which send the energy to travel far away from the surface\nand, reciprocally, receive power from far-located sources. We theoretically\npredict about 20-fold power transfer enhancement between the conjugately\nmatched power-receiving body (as compared with the ideal black body) and\nfar-zone sources. Reciprocally, the proposed structure radiates about 20 times\nmore power into far zone as compared with the same source over a perfect\nreflector.\n", "  We study lepton violating Higgs (HLFV) decays, first from the effective field\ntheory (EFT) point of view, and then analysing the different high-energy\nrealizations of the operators of the EFT, highlighting the most promising\nmodels. We argue why two Higgs doublet models can have a\n$\\mathrm{BR}(h\\rightarrow \\tau \\mu)\\sim 0.01$, and why this rate is suppressed\nin all other realizations including vector-like leptons. We further discuss\nHLFV in the context of neutrino mass models: in most cases it is generated at\none loop giving always $\\mathrm{BR}(h\\rightarrow \\tau \\mu) < 10^{-4}$ and\ntypically much less, which is beyond experimental reach. However, both the Zee\nmodel and extended left-right symmetric models contain extra ${\\rm SU(2)}$\ndoublets coupled to leptons and could in principle account for the observed\nexcess, with interesting connections between HLFV and neutrino parameters.\n", "  The interaction of a small object with surrounding plasma is an area of\nplasma-physics research with a multitude of applications. This paper introduces\nthe plasma octree code pot, a microscopic simulator of a spheroidal dust grain\nin a plasma. pot uses the Barnes-Hut treecode algorithm to perform $N$-body\nsimulations of electrons and ions in the vicinity of a chargeable spheroid,\nemploying also the Boris particle-motion integrator and Hutchinson's\nreinjection algorithm from SCEPTIC; a description of the implementation of all\nthree algorithms is provided. We present results from pot simulations of the\ncharging of spheres in magnetized plasmas, and of spheroids in unmagnetized\nplasmas. The results call into question the validity of using the Boltzmann\nrelation in hybrid PIC codes.\n", "  We revisit the calculation of instanton effects in correlation functions in\n${\\cal N}=4$ SYM involving the Konishi operator and operators of twist two.\nPrevious studies revealed that the scaling dimensions and the OPE coefficients\nof these operators do not receive instanton corrections in the semiclassical\napproximation. We go beyond this approximation and demonstrate that, while\noperators belonging to the same ${\\cal N}=4$ supermultiplet ought to have the\nsame conformal data, the evaluation of quantum instanton corrections for one\noperator can be mapped into a semiclassical computation for another operator in\nthe same supermultiplet. This observation allows us to compute explicitly the\nleading instanton correction to the scaling dimension of operators in the\nKonishi supermultiplet as well as to their structure constants in the OPE of\ntwo half-BPS scalar operators. We then use these results, together with\ncrossing symmetry, to determine instanton corrections to scaling dimensions of\ntwist-four operators with large spin.\n", "  Scattering amplitudes in Yang-Mills theory can be represented in the\nformalism of Cachazo, He and Yuan (CHY) as integrals over an auxiliary\nprojective space---fully localized on the support of the scattering equations.\nBecause solving the scattering equations is difficult and summing over the\nsolutions algebraically complex, a method of directly integrating the terms\nthat appear in this representation has long been sought. We solve this\nimportant open problem by first rewriting the terms in a manifestly\nMobius-invariant form and then using monodromy relations (inspired by analogy\nto string theory) to decompose terms into those for which combinatorial rules\nof integration are known. The result is a systematic procedure to obtain\nanalytic, covariant forms of Yang-Mills tree-amplitudes for any number of\nexternal legs and in any number of dimensions. As examples, we provide compact\nanalytic expressions for amplitudes involving up to six gluons of arbitrary\nhelicities.\n", "  We have endeavoured to understand the formation and evolution of the black\nhole (BH) X-ray binary LMC X-3. We estimate the properties of the system at 4\nevolutionary stages: 1) at the Zero Age Main Sequence (ZAMS), 2) just prior to\nthe supernova (SN) explosion of the primary, 3) just after the SN, and 4) at\nthe moment of RLO onset.We use a hybrid approach, combining detailed stellar\nstructure and binary evolution calculations with approximate population\nsynthesis models. This allows us to estimate potential natal kicks and the\nevolution of the BH spin. In the whole analysis we incorporate as model\nconstraints the most up-to-date observational information, encompassing the\nbinary's orbital properties, the companion star mass, effective temperature,\nsurface gravity and radius, as well as the black hole's mass and spin. We find\nthat LMC X-3 began as a ZAMS system with the mass of the primary star in the\nrange $M_{\\rm{1,ZAMS}}$ = 22-31 $\\rm{M_{\\odot}}$ and a secondary star of\n$M_{\\rm{2,ZAMS}} = 5.0-8.3M_{\\odot}$, in a wide ($P_{ZAMS} \\gtrsim 2.000\\, \\rm\ndays$) and eccentric ($e_{\\rm{ZAMS}} \\gtrsim 0.23$) orbit. Just prior to the\nSN, the primary has a mass of $M_{\\mathrm{1,preSN}} = 11.1-18.0\\,\\rm\nM_{\\odot}$, with the secondary star largely unaffected. The orbital period\ndecreases to $0.6-1.7\\, \\rm days$, and is still eccentric $0 \\leq\ne_{\\rm{preSN}} \\leq 0.44$. We find that a symmetric SN explosion with no or\nsmall natal kicks (a few tens of $\\rm km\\, s^{-1}$) imparted on the BH cannot\nbe formally excluded, however, large natal kicks in excess of $\\gtrsim 120\n\\,\\rm km\\, s^{-1}$ increase the estimated formation rate by an order of\nmagnitude. Following the SN, the system has a BH $M_{\\mathrm{BH,postSN}} =\n6.4-8.2\\,\\rm M_{\\odot}$ and is put into an eccentric orbit. At the RLO onset\nthe orbit is circularised and it has an orbital period of $P_{\\rm{RLO}} =\n0.8-1.4\\,\\rm days$.\n", "  Three-dimensional topological insulators (TIs) exhibit time-reversal symmetry\nprotected, linearly dispersing Dirac surface states. Band bending at the TI\nsurface may also lead to coexisting trivial two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG)\nstates with parabolic energy dispersion that exist as spin-split pairs due to\nRashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC). A bias current is expected to generate spin\npolarization in both systems arising from their helical spin-momentum locking.\nHowever, their induced spin polarization is expected to be different in both\nmagnitude and sign. Here, we compare spin potentiometric measurements of bias\ncurrent-generated spin polarization in Bi2Se3(111) films where Dirac surface\nstates coexist with trivial 2DEG states, with identical measurements on\nInAs(001) samples where only trivial 2DEG states are present. We observe spin\npolarization arising from spin-momentum locking in both cases, with opposite\nsigns of the spin voltage. We present a model based on spin dependent\nelectrochemical potentials to directly derive the signs expected for the TI\nsurface states, and unambiguously show that the dominant contribution to the\ncurrent-generated spin polarization measured in the TI is from the Dirac\nsurface states. This direct electrical access of the helical spin texture of\nDirac and Rashba 2DEG states is an enabling step towards the electrical\nmanipulation of spins in next generation TI and SOC based quantum devices.\n", "  We propose a search for photoproduction of leptophobic bosons that couple to\nquarks at the GlueX experiment at Jefferson Lab. We study in detail a new gauge\nboson that couples to baryon number $B$, and estimate that $\\gamma p \\to p B$\nwill provide the best sensitivity for $B$ masses above 0.5 GeV. This search\nwill also provide sensitivity to other proposed dark-sector states that couple\nto quarks. Finally, our results motivate a similar search for $B$ boson\nelectroproduction at the CLAS experiment.\n", "  A sector with QCD-like strong dynamics is common in models of non-standard\nphysics. Such a model could be accessible in LHC searches if both confinement\nand big-quarks charged under the confining group are at the TeV scale.\nBig-quark masses at this scale can be explained if the new fermions are chiral\nunder a new $U(1)^\\prime$ gauge symmetry such that their bare masses are\nrelated to the $U(1)^\\prime$-breaking and new confinement scales. Here we\npresent a study of a minimal GUT-motivated and gauge anomaly-free model with\nimplications for the LHC Run 2 searches. We find that the first signatures of\nsuch models could appear as two gauge boson resonances. The chiral nature of\nthe model could be confirmed by observation of a $Z^\\prime \\gamma$ resonance,\nwhere the $Z^\\prime$ naturally has a large leptonic branching ratio because of\nits kinetic mixing with the hypercharge gauge boson.\n", "  We study adatom-covered single layers of CrSiTe$_3$ and CrGeTe$_3$ using\nfirst-principles calculations based on hybrid functionals. We find that the\ninsulating ground state of a monolayer of La (Lu) deposited on single-layer\nCrSiTe$_3$ (CrGeTe$_3$) carries spontaneously generated current loops around\nthe Cr sites, These \"flux states\" induce antiferromagnetically ordered orbital\nmoments on the Cr sites and are also associated with nontrivial topological\nproperties. The calculated Chern numbers for these systems are predicted to be\n$\\pm 1$ even in the absence of spin-orbit coupling, with sizable gaps on the\norder of 100 meV. The flux states and the associated topological phases result\nfrom spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking due to the presence of\nnonlocal Coulomb interactions.\n", "  Silicon, the main constituent of microprocessor chips, is emerging as a\npromising material for the realization of future quantum processors. Leveraging\nits well-established complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology\nwould be a clear asset to the development of scalable quantum computing\narchitectures and to their co-integration with classical control hardware. Here\nwe report a silicon quantum bit (qubit) device made with an industry-standard\nfabrication process. The device consists of a two-gate, p-type transistor with\nan undoped channel. At low temperature, the first gate defines a quantum dot\n(QD) encoding a hole spin qubit, the second one a QD used for the qubit\nreadout. All electrical, two-axis control of the spin qubit is achieved by\napplying a phase-tunable microwave modulation to the first gate. Our result\nopens a viable path to qubit up-scaling through a readily exploitable CMOS\nplatform.\n", "  In Zombie Vortex Instability (ZVI), perturbations excite critical layers in\nstratified, rotating shear flow (as in protoplanetary disks), causing them to\ngenerate vortex layers, which roll-up into anticyclonic zombie vortices and\ncyclonic vortex sheets. The process is self-sustaining as zombie vortices\nperturb new critical layers, spawning a next generation of zombie vortices.\nHere, we focus on two issues: the minimum threshold of perturbations that\ntrigger self-sustaining vortex generation, and the properties of the late-time\nzombie turbulence on large and small scales. The critical parameter that\ndetermines whether ZVI is triggered is the magnitude of the vorticity on the\nsmall scales (and not velocity), the minimum Rossby number needed for\ninstability is $Ro_{crit}\\sim0.2$ for $\\beta\\equiv N/\\Omega = 2$, where $N$ is\nthe Brunt-V\\\"ais\\\"al\\\"a frequency. While the threshold is set by vorticity, it\nis useful to infer a criterion on the Mach number, for Kolmogorov noise, the\ncritical Mach number scales with Reynolds number: $Ma_{crit}\\sim\nRo_{crit}Re^{-1/2}$. In protoplanetary disks, this is $Ma_{crit}\\sim10^{-6}$.\nOn large scales, zombie turbulence is characterized by anticyclones and\ncyclonic sheets with typical Rossby number $\\sim$0.3. The spacing of the\ncyclonic sheets and anticyclones appears to have a \"memory\" of the spacing of\nthe critical layers. On the small scales, zombie turbulence has no memory of\nthe initial conditions and has a Kolmogorov-like energy spectrum. While our\nearlier work was in the limit of uniform stratification, we have demonstrated\nthat ZVI works for non-uniform Brunt-V\\\"ais\\\"al\\\"a frequency profiles that may\nbe found in protoplanetary disks.\n", "  We investigate the existence of ground states with prescribed mass for the\nfocusing nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation with $L^2$-critical power\nnonlinearity on noncompact quantum graphs. We prove that, unlike the case of\nthe real line, for certain classes of graphs there exist ground states with\nnegative energy for a whole interval of masses. A key role is played by a\nthorough analysis of Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequalities and on estimates of the\noptimal constants. Most of the techniques are new and suited to the\ninvestigation of variational problems on metric graphs.\n", "  The downward trend in Arctic sea ice extent is one of the most dramatic\nsignals of climate change during recent decades. Comprehensive climate models\nhave struggled to reproduce this, typically simulating a slower rate of sea ice\nretreat than has been observed. However, this bias has been widely noted to\nhave decreased in models participating in the most recent phase of the Coupled\nModel Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) compared with the previous generation of\nmodels (CMIP3). Here we examine simulations from both CMIP3 and CMIP5. We find\nthat simulated historical sea ice trends are influenced by volcanic forcing,\nwhich was included in all of the CMIP5 models but in only about half of the\nCMIP3 models. The volcanic forcing causes temporary simulated cooling in the\n1980s and 1990s, which contributes to raising the simulated 1979-2013\nglobal-mean surface temperature trends to values substantially larger than\nobserved. We show that this warming bias is accompanied by an enhanced rate of\nArctic sea ice retreat and hence a simulated sea ice trend that is closer to\nthe observed value, which is consistent with previous findings of an\napproximately linear relationship between sea ice extent and global-mean\nsurface temperature. We find that both generations of climate models simulate\nArctic sea ice that is substantially less sensitive to global warming than has\nbeen observed. The results imply that the much of the difference in Arctic sea\nice trends between CMIP3 and CMIP5 occurred due to the inclusion of volcanic\nforcing, rather than improved sea ice physics or model resolution.\n", "  We demonstrate that, if a truncated expansion of a wave function is small,\nthen the standard excited states computational method, of optimizing one root\nof a secular equation, may lead to an incorrect wave function - despite the\ncorrect energy according to the theorem of Hylleraas, Undheim and McDonald -\nwhereas our proposed method [J. Comput. Meth. Sci. Eng. 8, 277 (2008)]\n(independent of orthogonality to lower lying approximants) leads to correct\nreliable small truncated wave functions. The demonstration is done in He\nexcited states, using truncated series expansions in Hylleraas coordinates, as\nwell as standard configuration-interaction truncated expansions.\n", "  Oscillatory dynamics are ubiquitous in biological networks. Possible sources\nof oscillations are well understood in low-dimensional systems, but have not\nbeen fully explored in high-dimensional networks. Here we study large networks\nconsisting of randomly coupled rate units. We identify a novel type of\nbifurcation in which a continuous part of the eigenvalue spectrum of the linear\nstability matrix crosses the instability line at non-zero-frequency. This\nbifurcation occurs when the interactions are delayed and partially\nanti-symmetric, and leads to a heterogeneous oscillatory state in which\noscillations are apparent in the activity of individual units, but not on the\npopulation-average level.\n", "  The energy-momentum tensor for the gravitoelectromagnetism (GEM) theory in\nthe real-time finite temperature field theory formalism is presented.\nExpressions for the Casimir energy and pressure at zero and finite temperature\nare obtained. An analysis of the Casimir effect for the GEM field is developed.\n", "  The probability density distributions for the ground states of certain model\nsystems in quantum mechanics and for their classical counterparts are\nconsidered. It is shown, that classical distributions are remarkably improved\nby incorporating into them the Heisenberg uncertainty relation between position\nand momentum. Even the crude form of this incorporation makes the agreement\nbetween classical and quantum distributions unexpectedly good, except for the\nsmall area, where classical momenta are large. It is demonstrated that the\nslight improvement of this form, makes the classical distribution very similar\nto the quantum one in the whole space. The obtained results are much better\nthan those from the WKB method. The paper is devoted to ground states, but the\nmethod applies to excited states too.\n", "  It is often argued that the minimal supersymmetric standard model has O(100)\nfree parameters and the generic parameter region is already excluded by the\nnull observation of the flavor and CP violating processes as well as the\nconstraints from the LHC experiments. This situation naturally leads us to\nconsider the case where all the dangerous soft supersymmetry breaking terms\nsuch as the scalar masses and scalar couplings are absent, while only the\nunified gaugino mass term and the mu term are non-vanishing at the grand\nunification scale. We revisit this simple situation taking into account the\nobserved Higgs boson mass, 125 GeV. Since the gaugino mass and the mu term are\nfixed in order to explain the Higgs boson and the Z boson masses, there is no\nfree parameter left in this scenario. We find that there are three independent\nparameter sets exist including ones which have not been discussed in the\nliterature. We also find that the abundance of the dark matter can be explained\nby relic gravitinos which are non-thermally produced as decay products of the\nSUSY particles while satisfying constraints from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis. We\ndiscuss the effects of the gravity mediation which generically give\ncontribution to the soft terms of the order of the gravitino mass. It turns out\nthat newly found parameter set is preferable to explain the Higgs boson mass as\nwell as the gravitino dark matter while satisfying the constraints from the\nelectric dipole moments of the electron and the nucleon.\n", "  Using the field theoretic renormalization group technique in the two-loop\napproximation, turbulent Prandtl numbers are obtained in the general $A$ model\nof passive vector advected by fully developed turbulent velocity field with\nviolation of spatial parity introduced via continuous parameter $\\rho$ ranging\nfrom $\\rho=0$ (no violation of spatial parity) to $|\\rho|=1$ (maximum violation\nof spatial parity). In non-helical environments, we demonstrate that $A$ is\nrestricted to $-1.723 \\leq A \\leq 2.800$ (rounded on the last presented digit)\ndue to the constraints of two-loop calculations. When $\\rho >0.749$\nrestrictions may be removed. Furthermore, three physically important cases $A\n\\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$ are shown to lie deep within the allowed interval of $A$ for\nall values of $\\rho$. For the model of linearized Navier-Stokes equations ($A =\n-1$) up to date unknown helical values of turbulent Prandtl number have been\nshown to equal $1$ regardless of parity violation. Furthermore, we have shown\nthat interaction parameter $A$ exerts strong influence on advection diffusion\nprocesses in turbulent environments with broken spatial parity. In explicit,\ndepending on actual value of $A$ turbulent Prandtl number may increase or\ndecrease with $\\rho$. By varying $A$ continuously we explain high stability of\nkinematic MHD model ($A=1$) against helical effects as a result of its\ncloseness to $A = 0.912$ (rounded on the last presented digit) case where\nhelical effects are completely suppressed. Contrary, for the physically\nimportant $A=0$ model we show that it lies deep within the interval of models\nwhere helical effects cause the turbulent Prandtl number to decrease with\n$|\\rho|$. We thus identify internal structure of interactions given by\nparameter $A$, and not the vector character of the admixture itself to be the\ndominant factor influencing diffusion advection processes in the helical $A$\nmodel.\n", "  Nonlinear triadic interactions are at the heart of our understanding of\nturbulence. In flows where waves are present modes must not only be in a triad\nto interact, but their frequencies must also satisfy an extra condition: the\ninteractions that dominate the energy transfer are expected to be resonant. We\nderive equations that allow direct measurement of the actual degree of\nresonance of each triad in a turbulent flow. We then apply the method to the\ncase of rotating turbulence, where eddies coexist with inertial waves. We show\nthat for a range of wave numbers, resonant and near-resonant triads are\ndominant, the latter allowing a transfer of net energy towards two-dimensional\nmodes that would be inaccessible otherwise. The results are in good agreement\nwith approximations often done in theories of rotating turbulence, and with the\nmechanism of parametric instability proposed to explain the development of\nanisotropy in such flows. We also observe that, at least for the moderate\nRossby numbers studied here, marginally near-resonant and non-resonant triads\nplay a non-negligible role in the coupling of modes.\n", "  We present an analysis of the relationship between the orientation of\nmagnetic fields and filaments that form in 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations\nof cluster-forming, turbulent molecular cloud clumps. We examine simulated\ncloud clumps with size scales of L ~ 2-4 pc and densities of n ~ 400-1000 cm^-3\nwith Alfven Mach numbers near unity. We simulated two cloud clumps of different\nmasses, one in virial equilibrium, the other strongly gravitationally bound,\nbut with the same initial turbulent velocity field and similar mass-to-flux\nratio. We apply various techniques to analyze the filamentary and magnetic\nstructure of the resulting cloud, including the DisPerSE filament-finding\nalgorithm in 3D. The largest structure that forms is a 1-2 parsec-long\nfilament, with smaller connecting sub-filaments. We find that our simulated\nclouds, wherein magnetic forces and turbulence are comparable, coherent\norientation of the magnetic field depends on the virial parameter. Subvirial\nclumps undergo strong gravitational collapse and magnetic field lines are\ndragged with the accretion flow. We see evidence of filament-aligned flow and\naccretion flow onto the filament in the subvirial cloud. Magnetic fields\noriented more parallel in the subvirial cloud and more perpendicular in the\ndenser, marginally bound cloud. Radiative feedback from a 16 Msun star forming\nin a cluster in one of our simulations ultimately results in the destruction of\nthe main filament, the formation of an HII region, and the sweeping up of\nmagnetic fields within an expanding shell at the edges of the HII region.\n", "  We assess the impact of cell cycle noise on gene circuit dynamics. For\nbistable genetic switches and excitable circuits, we find that transitions\nbetween metastable states most likely occur just after cell division and that\nthis concentration effect intensifies in the presence of transcriptional delay.\nWe explain this concentration effect with a 3-states stochastic model. For\ngenetic oscillators, we quantify the temporal correlations between daughter\ncells induced by cell division. Temporal correlations must be captured properly\nin order to accurately quantify noise sources within gene networks.\n", "  We study Schr\\\"odinger operators $H=-\\Delta+V$ in $L^2(\\Omega)$ where\n$\\Omega$ is $\\mathbb R^d$ or the half-space $\\mathbb R_+^d$, subject to (real)\nRobin boundary conditions in the latter case. For $p>d$ we construct a non-real\npotential $V\\in L^p(\\Omega)\\cap L^{\\infty}(\\Omega)$ that decays at infinity so\nthat $H$ has infinitely many non-real eigenvalues accumulating at every point\nof the essential spectrum $\\sigma_{\\rm ess}(H)=[0,\\infty)$. This demonstrates\nthat the Lieb-Thirring inequalities for selfadjoint Schr\\\"odinger operators are\nno longer true in the non-selfadjoint case.\n", "  A theory of relative species abundance on sparsely-connected networks is\npresented by investigating the replicator dynamics with symmetric interactions.\nSparseness of a network involves difficulty in analyzing the fixed points of\nthe equation, and we avoid this problem by treating large self interaction $u$,\nwhich allows us to construct a perturbative expansion. Based on this\nperturbation, we find that the nature of the interactions is directly connected\nto the abundance distribution, and some characteristic behaviors, such as\nmultiple peaks in the abundance distribution and all species coexistence at\nmoderate values of $u$, are discovered in a wide class of the distribution of\nthe interactions. The all species coexistence collapses at a critical value of\n$u$, $u_c$, and this collapsing is regarded as a phase transition. To get more\nquantitative information, we also construct a non-perturbative theory on random\ngraphs based on techniques of statistical mechanics. The result shows those\ncharacteristic behaviors are sustained well even for not large $u$. For even\nsmaller values of $u$, extinct species start to appear and the abundance\ndistribution becomes rounded and closer to a standard functional form. Another\ninteresting finding is the non-monotonic behavior of diversity, which\nquantifies the number of coexisting species, when changing the ratio of\nmutualistic relations $\\Delta$. These results are examined by numerical\nsimulations, and the multiple peaks in the abundance distribution are confirmed\nto be robust against a certain level of modifications of the problem. The\nnumerical results also show that our theory is exact for the case without\nextinct species, but becomes less and less precise as the proportion of extinct\nspecies grows.\n", "  Information transfer is an essential factor in determining the robustness of\ncollective behaviour in biological systems with distributed control. The most\ndirect way to study the information transfer mechanisms is to experimentally\ndetect the propagation across the system of a signal triggered by some\nperturbation. However, for field experiments this method is inefficient, as the\npossibilities of the observer to perturb the group are limited and empirical\nobservations must rely on rare natural perturbations. An alternative way is to\nuse spatio-temporal correlations to assess the information transfer mechanism\ndirectly from the spontaneous fluctuations of the system, without the need to\nhave an actual propagating signal on record. We test the approach on ground\ntruth data provided by numerical simulations in three dimensions of two models\nof collective behaviour characterized by very different dynamical equations and\ninformation transfer mechanisms: the classic Vicsek model, describing an\noverdamped noninertial dynamics and the inertial spin model, characterized by\nan un- derdamped inertial dynamics. By using dynamical finite size scaling, we\nshow that spatio-temporal correlations are able to distinguish unambiguously\nthe diffusive information transfer mechanism of the Vicsek model from the\nlinear mechanism of the inertial spin model.\n", "  A next step in development of the KrkNLO method of including complete NLO QCD\ncorrections to hard processes in a LO parton-shower Monte Carlo (PSMC) is\npresented. It consists of generalisation of the method, previously used for the\nDrell-Yan process, to Higgs-boson production. This extension is accompanied\nwith the complete description of parton distribution functions (PDFs) in a\ndedicated, Monte Carlo (MC) factorisation scheme, applicable to any process of\nproduction of one or more colour-neutral particles in hadron-hadron collisions.\n", "  We present the calculation of the impact factor for the $\\gamma^{(*)}\\to\nq\\bar{q}$ transition with one loop accuracy in arbitrary kinematics. The\ncalculation was done within Balitsky's high energy operator expansion. Together\nwith our previous result for the $\\gamma^{(*)}\\to q\\bar{q} g$ Born impact\nfactor it allows one to derive cross-sections for 2- (one loop) and 3-jet\n(Born) difractive electroproduction. We write such cross sections for the 2 and\n3 jet exclusive diffractive electroproduction off a proton in terms of hadronic\nmatrix elements of Wilson lines. For the 2-jet cross section we demonstrate the\ncancellation of IR, collinear and rapidity singularities. Our result can be\ndirectly exploited to describe the recently analyzed data on exclusive dijet\nproduction at HERA and used for the study of jet photoproduction in\nultraperipheral proton or nuclear scattering.\n", "  The imperfect knowledge of the Higgs boson decay rates and cross sections at\nthe LHC constitutes a critical systematic uncertainty in the study of the Higgs\nboson properties. We show that the full covariance matrix between the Higgs\nrates can be determined from the most elementary sources of uncertainty by a\ndirect application of probability theory. We evaluate the error magnitudes and\nfull correlation matrix on the set of Higgs cross sections and branching ratios\nat $\\sqrt{s}=7$, $8$, $13$ and $14$ TeV, which are provided in ancillary files.\nThe impact of this correlation matrix on the global fits is illustrated with\nthe latest $7$+$8$ TeV Higgs dataset.\n", "  The impact of uncertainties in surface layer physics on the atmospheric\ngeneral circulation is comparatively unexplored. Here the sensitivity of the\nzonal-mean circulation to reduced air-sea momentum roughness ($Z_{0m}$) at low\nflow speed is investigated with the Community Atmosphere Model (CAM3). In an\naquaplanet framework with prescribed sea surface temperatures, the response to\nreduced $Z_{0m}$ resembles the La Ni$\\tilde{\\text{n}}$a minus El\nNi$\\tilde{\\text{n}}$o response to El Ni$\\tilde{\\text{n}}$o Southern Oscillation\nvariability with: i) a poleward shift of the mid-latitude westerlies extending\nall the way to the surface; ii) a weak poleward shift of the subtropical\ndescent region; and iii) a weakening of the Hadley circulation, which is\ngenerally also accompanied by a poleward shift of the inter-tropical\nconvergence zone (ITCZ) and the tropical surface easterlies. Mechanism-denial\nexperiments show this response to be initiated by the reduction of tropical\nlatent and sensible heat fluxes, effected by reducing $Z_{0m}$. The circulation\nresponse is elucidated by considering the effect of the tropical energy fluxes\non the Hadley circulation strength, the upper tropospheric critical layer\nlatitudes, and the lower-tropospheric baroclinic eddy forcing. The ITCZ shift\nis understood via moist static energy budget analysis in the tropics. The\ncirculation response to reduced $Z_{0m}$ carries over to more complex setups\nwith seasonal cycle, full complexity of atmosphere-ice-land-ocean interaction,\nand a slab ocean lower boundary condition. Hence, relatively small changes in\nthe surface parameterization parameters can lead to a significant circulation\nresponse.\n", "  We constructed a new time-of-flight (TOF) detector consisting of resistive\nplate chambers (RPCs) to measure particle energy in the BGOegg experiment. The\nBGOegg-RPC has a unique feature which enables us to cover a large area with a\nsmall number of readout channels. For this purpose, we developed the RPC with a\nstrip size of 2.5 cm $\\times$ 100 cm. The BGOegg-RPC covers an area of 320 cm\n$\\times$ 200 cm with only 256 channels of readout electronics. In case of large\nreadout RPCs, an originated signal is distorted and dispersed during\npropagation. In addition, there happens a signal reflection at the end of the\nstrip. Although we designed the BGOegg-RPC and front-end electronics with\nminimized signal reflection, a small reflection still remained, deteriorating\nthe resulting time resolution. After establishing calibration and correction\nmethods to improve the performance of the BGOegg-RPC, we obtained the time\nresolution of {\\sigma}~60 ps around the central region of strips.\n", "  The resonator-induced phase (RIP) gate is a multi-qubit entangling gate that\nallows a high degree of flexibility in qubit frequencies, making it attractive\nfor quantum operations in large-scale architectures. We experimentally realize\nthe RIP gate with four superconducting qubits in a three-dimensional (3D)\ncircuit-quantum electrodynamics architecture, demonstrating high-fidelity\ncontrolled-Z (CZ) gates between all possible pairs of qubits from two different\n4-qubit devices in pair subspaces. These qubits are arranged within a wide\nrange of frequency detunings, up to as large as 1.8 GHz. We further show a\ndynamical multi-qubit refocusing scheme in order to isolate out 2-qubit\ninteractions, and combine them to generate a four-qubit\nGreenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state.\n", "  We explicitly construct and list all unitary superconformal multiplets, along\nwith their index contributions, in five and six dimensions. From this data, we\nuncover various unifying themes in the representation theory of five- and\nsix-dimensional superconformal field theories. At the same time, we provide a\ndetailed argument for the complete classification of unitary irreducible\nrepresentations in five dimensions using a combination of physical and\nmathematical techniques.\n", "  We consider the production of a pseudo-scalar particle $A$ at the LHC, and\npresent accurate theoretical predictions for its inclusive cross section in\ngluon fusion. The prediction is based on combining fixed-order perturbation\ntheory and all-order threshold resummation. At fixed order we include the exact\nnext-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) plus an approximate\nnext-to-next-to-next-to-leading order (N$^3$LO$_{\\rm A}$) which is based on the\nrecent computation at this order for the scalar case. We then add threshold\nresummation at next-to-next-to-next-to leading logarithmic accuracy\n(N$^3$LL$^\\prime$). Various forms of threshold resummation are considered,\ndiffering by the treatment of subleading terms, allowing a robust estimate of\nthe theoretical uncertainties due to missing higher orders. With particular\nattention to pseudo-scalar masses of $200$ GeV and $750$ GeV, we also observe\nthat perturbative convergence is much improved when resummation is included.\nAdditionally, results obtained with threshold resummation in direct QCD are\ncompared with analogous results as computed in soft-collinear effective theory,\nwhich turn out to be in good agreement. We provide precise predictions for\npseudo-scalar inclusive cross section at $13$ TeV LHC for a wide range of\nmasses. The results are available through updated versions of the public codes\nggHiggs and TROLL.\n", "  Cilia and flagella exhibit regular bending waves that perform mechanical work\non the surrounding fluid, to propel cellular swimmers and pump fluids inside\norganisms. Here, we quantify a force-velocity relationship of the beating\nflagellum, by exposing flagellated \\emph{Chlamydomonas} cells to controlled\nmicrofluidic flows. A simple theory of flagellar limit-cycle oscillations,\ncalibrated by measurements in the absence of flow, reproduces this relationship\nquantitatively. We derive a link between the chemo-mechanical efficiency of the\nflagellar beat and its ability to synchronize to oscillatory flows.\n", "  Crystal surfaces are sensitive to the surrounding environment, where atoms\nleft with broken bonds reconstruct to minimize surface energy. In many cases,\nthe surface can exhibit chemical properties unique from the bulk. These\ndifferences are important as they control reactions and mediate thin film\ngrowth. This is particularly true for complex oxides where certain terminating\ncrystal planes are polar and have a net dipole moment. For polar terminations,\nreconstruction of atoms on the surface is the central mechanism to avoid the so\ncalled polar catastrophe. This adds to the complexity of the reconstruction\nwhere charge polarization and stoichiometry govern the final surface in\naddition to standard thermodynamic parameters such as temperature and partial\npressure. Here we present direct, in-situ determination of polar SrTiO3 (110)\nsurfaces at temperatures up to 900 C using cross-sectional aberration corrected\nscanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). Under these conditions, we\nobserve the coexistence of various surface structures that change as a function\nof temperature. As the specimen temperature is lowered, the reconstructed\nsurface evolves due to thermal mismatch with the substrate. Periodic defects,\nsimilar to dislocations, are found in these surface structures and act to\nrelieve stress due to mismatch. Combining STEM observations and electron\nspectroscopy with density functional theory, we find a combination of lattice\nmisfit and charge compensation for stabilization. Beyond the characterization\nof these complex reconstructions, we have developed a general framework that\nopens a new pathway to simultaneously investigate the surface and near surface\nregions of single crystals as a function of environment.\n", "  A major challenge in computation of engineering flows is to derive and\nimprove turbulence models built on turbulence physics. Here, we present a\nphysics-based modified $k-\\omega$ equation for canonical wall bounded turbulent\nflows (boundary layer, channel and pipe), predicting both mean velocity profile\n(MVP) and streamwise mean kinetic energy profile (SMKP) with high accuracy over\na wide range of Reynolds number ($Re$). The result builds on a multi-layer\nquantification of wall flows, which allows a significant modification of the\n$k-\\omega$ equation. Three innovations are introduced: First, an adjustment of\nthe Karman constant to 0.45 is set for the overlap region with a logarithmic\nMVP. Second, a wake parameter models the turbulent transport near the\ncenterline. Third, an anomalous dissipation factor represents the effect of a\nmeso layer in the overlap region. Then, a highly accurate (above 99\\%)\nprediction of MVPs is obtained in Princeton pipes, improving the original model\nprediction by up to 10\\%. Moreover, the entire SMKP, including the newly\nobserved outer peak, is predicted. With a slight change of the wake parameter,\nthe model also yields accurate predictions for channels and boundary layers.\n", "  Within the framework of Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire (LGD) theory we studied\nthe role of the flexocoupling between the order parameter and elastic strain\ngradients in the stability of a spatially-modulated phase (SMP) in ferroics\nwith commensurate and incommensurate long-range ordered phases under the\npresence of squired elastic strain gradient. The squired elastic strain\ngradient is required for the free energy stability to arbitrary strain\ngradients. Obtained analytical expressions showed that the fundamental upper\nlimit for the magnitude of the static bulk flexoelectric effect strength,\nestablished by Yudin and Tagantsev under the absence of squired elastic strain\ngradient and higher order gradients terms, should be substituted by the\ntemperature-dependent condition on the flexoelectric coupling strength under\nthe presence of the gradient terms. Moreover, we established that the SMP\nappears and becomes stable in commensurate ferroics if the flexocoupling\nconstant exceeds the critical value, defined by the reduced temperature, strain\nand order parameter gradients constants, striction and expansion coefficients\nin the LGD functional. We calculated the soft phonon dispersion in ferroics\nwith commensurate and incommensurate long-range ordered phases allowing for the\nsquired elastic strain gradient, as well as static and dynamic flexocoupling.\nAppeared that the dispersion for the optic mode is slightly sensitive to the\nflexocoupling, while the dispersion of acoustic mode strongly depends on the\ncoupling strength. Obtained results demonstrate that the non-trivial\ndifferences in the dispersion of optic and acoustic modes appear under the\nchange of flexocoupling constant.\n", "  We update our perturbative determination of MSbar bottom quark mass mb(mb),\nby including the recently obtained four-loop coefficient in the relation\nbetween the pole and MSbar mass. First the renormalon subtracted (RS or RS')\nmass is determined from the known mass of the Upsilon(1S) meson, where we use\nthe renormalon residue Nm obtained from the asymptotic behavior of the\ncoefficient of the 3-loop static singlet potential. MSbar mass is then obtained\nusing the 4-loop renormalon-free relation between the RS (RS') and MSbar mass.\nWe argue that the effects of the charm quark mass are accounted for by\neffectively using Nf=3 in the mass relations. The extracted value is mb(mb) =\n4222(40) MeV, where the uncertainty is dominated by the renormalization scale\ndependence.\n", "  Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) entanglement introduced in 1935 deals with two\nparticles that are entangled in their positions and momenta. Here we report the\nfirst experimental demonstration of EPR position-momentum entanglement of\nnarrowband photon pairs generated from cold atoms. By using two-photon quantum\nghost imaging and ghost interference, we demonstrate explicitly that the\nnarrowband photon pairs violate the separability criterion, confirming EPR\nentanglement. We further demonstrate continuous variable EPR steering for\npositions and momenta of the two photons. Our new source of EPR-entangled\nnarrowband photons is expected to play an essential role in\nspatially-multiplexed quantum information processing, such as, storage of\nquantum correlated images, quantum interface involving hyper-entangled photons,\netc.\n", "  We examine an unexplored quantum phenomenon we call oscillatory localization,\nwhere a discrete-time quantum walk with Grover's diffusion coin jumps back and\nforth between two vertices. We then connect it to the power dissipation of a\nrelated electric network. Namely, we show that there are only two kinds of\noscillating states, called uniform states and flip states, and that the\nprojection of an arbitrary state onto a flip state is bounded by the power\ndissipation of an electric circuit. By applying this framework to states along\na single edge of a graph, we show that low effective resistance implies\noscillatory localization of the quantum walk. This reveals that oscillatory\nlocalization occurs on a large variety of regular graphs, including\nedge-transitive, expander, and high degree graphs. As a corollary, high\nedge-connectivity also implies localization of these states, since it is\nclosely related to electric resistance.\n", "  In applying the gauge-gravity duality to the quark-gluon plasma, one models\nthe plasma using a particular kind of field theory with specified values of the\ntemperature, magnetic field, and so forth. One then assumes that the bulk, an\nasymptotically AdS black hole spacetime with properties chosen to match those\nof the boundary field theory, can be embedded in string theory. But this is not\nalways the case: there are field theories with no bulk dual. The question is\nwhether these theories might include those used to study the actual plasmas\nproduced at such facilities as the RHIC experiment or the relevant experiments\nat the LHC. We argue that, \\emph{provided} that due care is taken to include\nthe effects of the angular momentum associated with the magnetic fields\nexperienced by the plasmas produced by peripheral collisions, the existence of\nthe dual can be established for the RHIC plasmas. In the case of the LHC\nplasmas, the situation is much more doubtful.\n", "  Following the induced gravitational collapse (IGC) paradigm of gamma-ray\nbursts (GRBs) associated with type Ib/c supernovae, we present numerical\nsimulations of the explosion of a carbon-oxygen (CO) core in a binary system\nwith a neutron-star (NS) companion. The supernova ejecta trigger a\n\\emph{hypercritical} accretion process onto the NS thanks to a copious neutrino\nemission and the trapping of photons within the accretion flow. We show that\ntemperatures 1--10~MeV develop near the NS surface, hence electron-positron\nannihilation into neutrinos becomes the main cooling channel leading to\naccretion rates $10^{-9}$--$10^{-1}~M_\\odot$~s$^{-1}$ and neutrino luminosities\n$10^{43}$--$10^{52}$~erg~s$^{-1}$ (the shorter the orbital period the higher\nthe accretion rate). We estimate the maximum orbital period, $P_{\\rm max}$, as\na function of the NS initial mass, up to which the NS companion can reach by\nhypercritical accretion the critical mass for gravitational collapse leading to\nblack-hole (BH) formation. We then estimate the effects of the accreting and\norbiting NS companion onto a novel geometry of the supernova ejecta density\nprofile. We present the results of a $1.4\\times 10^7$~particle simulation which\nshow that the NS induces accentuated asymmetries in the ejecta density around\nthe orbital plane. We elaborate on the observables associated with the above\nfeatures of the IGC process. We apply this framework to specific GRBs: we find\nthat X-ray flashes (XRFs) and binary-driven hypernovae (BdHNe) are produced in\nbinaries with $P>P_{\\rm max}$ and $P < P_{\\rm max}$, respectively. We analyze\nin detail the case of XRF 060218.\n", "  We derive formulas for the classical Chern-Simons invariant of irreducible\n$SU(n)$-flat connections on negatively curved locally symmetric\nthree-manifolds. We determine the condition for which the theory remains\nconsistent (with basic physical principles). We show that a connection between\nholomorphic values of Selberg-type functions at point zero, associated with\nR-torsion of the flat bundle, and twisted Dirac operators acting on negatively\ncurved manifolds, can be interpreted by means of the Chern-Simons invariant. On\nthe basis of Labastida-Marino-Ooguri-Vafa conjecture we analyze a\nrepresentation of the Chern-Simons quantum partition function (as a generating\nseries of quantum group invariants) in the form of an infinite product weighted\nby S-functions and Selberg-type functions. We consider the case of links and a\nknot and use the Rogers approach to discover certain symmetry and modular form\nidentities.\n", "  We examine the onset of superfluid instabilities for geometries that exhibit\nhyperscaling violation and Lifshitz-like scaling at infrared and intermediate\nenergy scales, and approach AdS in the ultraviolet. In particular, we are\ninterested in the role of a non-trivial coupling between the neutral scalar\nsupporting the scaling regime, and the (charged) complex scalar which\ncondenses. The analysis focuses exclusively on unstable modes arising from the\nhyperscaling-violating portion of the geometry. Working at zero temperature, we\nidentify simple analytical criteria for the presence of scalar instabilities,\nand discuss under which conditions a minimal charge will be needed to trigger a\ntransition. Finite temperature examples are constructed numerically for a few\nillustrative cases.\n", "  We present a generalized Landau-Brazovskii theory for the solidification of\nchiral molecules on a spherical surface. With increasing sphere radius one\nencounters first intervals where robust achiral density modulations appear with\nicosahedral symmetry via first-order transitions. Next, one en- counters\nintervals where fragile but stable icosahedral structures still can be\nconstructed but only by superposition of multiple irreducible representations.\nChiral icoshedral structures appear via continuous or very weakly first-order\ntransitions. Outside these parameter intervals, icosahedral symmetry is broken\nalong a three-fold axis or a five-fold axis. The predictions of the theory are\ncompared with recent numerical simulations.\n", "  Low-energy magnon bands in a two-dimensional spin ice model become integer\nquantum magnon Hall bands. By calculating the localization length and the\ntwo-terminal conductance of magnon transport, we show that the magnon bands\nwith disorders undergo a quantum phase transition from an integer quantum\nmagnon Hall regime to a conventional magnon localized regime. Finite size\nscaling analysis as well as a critical conductance distribution shows that the\nquantum critical point belongs to the same universality class as that in the\nquantum Hall transition. We characterize thermal magnon Hall conductivity in\ndisordered quantum magnon Hall system in terms of robust chiral edge magnon\ntransport.\n", "  The temperature dependence of the sum of the QCD up- and down-quark masses,\n$(m_u + m_d)$ and the pion decay constant, $f_\\pi$, are determined from two\nthermal finite energy QCD sum rules for the pseudoscalar-current correlator.\nThis quark-mass remains mostly constant for temperatures well below the\ncritical temperature for deconfinement/chiral-symmetry restoration. As this\ncritical temperature is approached, the quark-mass increases sharply with\nincreasing temperature. This increase is far more pronounced if the temperature\ndependence of the pion mass (determined independently from other methods) is\ntaken into account. The behavior of $f_\\pi(T)$ is consistent with the\nexpectation from chiral symmetry, i.e. that it should follow the thermal\ndependence of the quark condensate, independently of the quark mass.\n", "  We consider the generating function of the algebraic area of lattice walks,\nevaluated at a root of unity, and its relation to the Hofstadter model. In\nparticular, we obtain an expression for the generating function of the n-th\nmoments of the Hofstadter Hamiltonian in terms of a complete elliptic integral,\nevaluated at a rational function. This in turn gives us both exact and\nasymptotic formulas for these moments.\n", "  Frequency comb generation in microresonators at visible wavelengths has found\napplications in a variety of areas such as metrology, sensing, and imaging. To\nachieve Kerr combs based on four-wave mixing in a microresonator, dispersion\nmust be in the anomalous regime. In this work, we demonstrate dispersion\nengineering in a microbubble resonator (MBR) fabricated by a two-CO$_2$ laser\nbeam technique. By decreasing the wall thickness of the MBR down to 1.4 $\\mu$m,\nthe zero dispersion wavelength shifts to values shorter than 764 nm, making\nphase matching possible around 765 nm. With the optical \\textit{Q}-factor of\nthe MBR modes being greater than $10^7$, four-wave mixing is observed at 765 nm\nfor a pump power of 3 mW. By increasing the pump power, parametric oscillation\nis achieved, and a frequency comb with 14 comb lines is generated at visible\nwavelengths.\n", "  Recent angle-resolved photoemission experiments have observed a\nproximity-induced superconducting gap in the helical surface states of a thin\nfilm of the 3D topological insulator Bi$_2$Se$_3$ grown on a superconducting\nNbSe$_2$ substrate. The superconducting coherence peaks in the electronic\ndensity of states are strongly suppressed when the topological insulator is\ndoped with magnetic Mn impurities, which was interpreted as the complete\ndestruction of helical superconductivity in the topological surface states.\nMotivated by these experiments, we explore a different possibility: gapless\nhelical superconductivity, where a gapless electronic density of states\ncoexists with a nonzero helical superconducting order parameter. We study a\nmodel of superconducting Dirac fermions coupled to random magnetic impurities\nwithin the Abrikosov-Gor'kov framework, and find finite regions of gapless\nhelical superconductivity in the phase diagram of the system for both\nproximity-induced and intrinsic superconductivity. For the latter, we derive\nuniversal rates of supression of the superconducting transition temperature due\nto magnetic scattering and, for a Fermi level at the Dirac point, a universal\nrate of increase of the quantum critical attraction strength.\n", "  We study integrable models with $\\mathfrak{gl}(2|1)$ symmetry and solvable by\nnested algebraic Bethe ansatz. We obtain a determinant representation for\nscalar products of Bethe vectors, when the Bethe parameters obey some relations\nweaker than the Bethe equations. This representation allows us to find the\nnorms of on-shell Bethe vectors and obtain determinant formulas for form\nfactors of the diagonal entries of the monodromy matrix.\n", "  Transport measurements are performed on InAs/GaSb double quantum wells at\nzero and finite magnetic fields applied parallel and perpendicular to the\nquantum wells. We investigate a sample in the inverted regime where electrons\nand holes coexist, and compare it with another sample in the non-inverted\nsemiconducting regime. Activated behavior in conjunction with a strong\nsuppression of the resistance peak at the charge neutrality point in a parallel\nmagnetic field attest to the topological hybridization gap between electron and\nhole bands in the inverted sample. We observe an unconventional Landau level\nspectrum with energy gaps modulated by the magnetic field applied perpendicular\nto the quantum wells. This is caused by strong spin-orbit interaction provided\njointly by the InAs and the GaSb quantum wells.\n", "  We construct a parallel stochastic dynamics with invariant measure converging\nto the Gibbs measure of the low temperature Ising model. The proof of such\nconvergence requires a polymer expansion based on suitably defined Peierls-type\ncontours.\n", "  These lectures provide an updated pedagogical treatment of the theoretical\nstructure and phenomenology of some basic mechanisms for inflation, along with\nan overview of the structure of cosmological uplifts of holographic duality. A\nfull treatment of the problem requires `ultraviolet completion' because of the\nsensitivity of inflation to quantum gravity effects, including back reaction\nand non-adiabatic production of heavy degrees of freedom. Cosmological\nobservations imply accelerated expansion of the late universe, and provide\nincreasingly precise constraints and discovery potential on the amplitude and\nshape of primordial tensor and scalar perturbations, and some of their\ncorrelation functions. Most backgrounds of string theory have positive\npotential energy, with a rich but still highly constrained landscape of\nsolutions. The theory contains novel mechanisms for inflation, some subject to\nsignificant observational tests. Although the detailed ultraviolet completion\nis not accessible experimentally, some of these mechanisms directly stimulate a\nmore systematic analysis of the space of low energy theories and signatures\nrelevant for analysis of data, which is sensitive to physics orders of\nmagnitude above the energy scale of inflation as a result of long time\nevolution (dangerous irrelevance) and the substantial amount of data. Portions\nof these lectures appeared previously in Les Houches 2013, \"Post-Planck\nCosmology\" .\n", "  We introduce an optomechanical scheme for the probabilistic preparation of\nsingle-phonon Fock states of mechanical modes based on photo-subtraction. The\nquality of the produced mechanical state is confirmed by a number of\nindicators, including phonon statistics and conditional fidelity. We assess the\ndetrimental effect of parameters such as the temperature of the mechanical\nsystem and address the feasibility of the scheme with state-of-the-art\ntechnology.\n", "  The influence of the underlying flow topology on the shape and size of\nsub-Kolmogorov droplets dispersed in a turbulent flow is of considerable\ninterest in many industrial and scientific applications. In this work we study\nthe deformation and orientation statistics of sub-Kolmogorov droplets dispersed\ninto a turbulent Taylor-Couette flow. Along with Direct Numerical Simulations\n(DNS) of the carrier phase and Lagrangian tracking of the dispersed droplets,\nwe solve a phenomenological equation proposed by Maffettone and Minale\n(\\emph{J. Fluid Mech.} 78, 227-241 (1998)) to track the shape evolution and\norientation of approximately $10^5$ ellipsoidal droplets. By varying the\ncapillary number $Ca$ and viscosity ratio $\\hat \\mu$ of the droplets we find\nthat the droplets deform more with increasing capillary number $Ca$ and this\neffect is more pronounced in the boundary layer regions. This indicates that\nalong with a capillary number effect there is also a strong correlation between\nspatial position and degree of deformation of the droplet. Regardless of the\ncapillary number $Ca$, the major-axis of the ellipsoids tends to align with the\nstream-wise direction and the extensional strain rate eigen direction in the\nboundary layer region while the distribution is highly isotropic in the bulk.\nWhen the viscosity ratio between the droplet and the carrier fluid is increased\nwe find that there is no preferential stretched axis which is due to the\nincreased influence of rotation over stretching and relaxation. Droplets in\nhigh viscosity ratio systems are thus less deformed and oblate (disk-like) as\ncompared to highly deformed prolate (cigar-like) droplets in low viscosity\nratio systems.\n", "  One major change of the future revision of the International System of Units\n(SI) is a new definition of the ampere based on the elementary charge \\emph{e}.\nReplacing the former definition based on Amp\\`ere's force law will allow one to\nfully benefit from quantum physics to realize the ampere. However, a quantum\nrealization of the ampere from \\emph{e}, accurate to within $10^{-8}$ in\nrelative value and fulfilling traceability needs, is still missing despite many\nefforts have been spent for the development of single-electron tunneling\ndevices. Starting again with Ohm's law, applied here in a quantum circuit\ncombining the quantum Hall resistance and Josephson voltage standards with a\nsuperconducting cryogenic amplifier, we report on a practical and universal\nprogrammable quantum current generator. We demonstrate that currents generated\nin the milliampere range are quantized in terms of $ef_\\mathrm{J}$\n($f_\\mathrm{J}$ is the Josephson frequency) with a measurement uncertainty of\n$10^{-8}$. This new quantum current source, able to deliver such accurate\ncurrents down to the microampere range, can greatly improve the current\nmeasurement traceability, as demonstrated with the calibrations of digital\nammeters. Beyond, it opens the way to further developments in metrology and in\nfundamental physics, such as a quantum multimeter or new accurate comparisons\nto single electron pumps.\n", "  Fermion bilinear operators of mass dimension~$3$, such as the axial-vector\nand vector currents, the pseudo-scalar and scalar densities, whose\nnormalizations are fixed by Ward--Takahashi (WT) relations, are related to\nsmall flow-time behavior of composite operators of fermion fields evolved by\nL\\\"uscher's flow equation. The representations can be useful in lattice\nnumerical simulations, as recently demonstrated by the WHOT QCD collaboration\nfor the chiral condensation of the $N_f=2+1$ quantum chromodynamics (QCD) at\nfinite temperature.\n", "  In nuclear physics, Density Functional Theory (DFT) provides the basis for\nstate-of-the art studies of ground-state properties of heavy nuclei. However,\nthe direct relation of the density functional underlying these calculations and\nthe microscopic nuclear forces is not yet fully understood. We present a\ncombination of DFT and Renormalization Group (RG) techniques which allows to\nstudy selfbound many-body systems from microscopic interactions. We discuss its\napplication with the aid of systems of identical fermions interacting via a\nlong-range attractive and short-range repulsive two-body force in one\ndimension. We compute ground-state energies, intrinsic densities, and density\ncorrelation functions of these systems and compare our results to those\nobtained from other methods. In particular, we show how energies of excited\nstates as well as the absolute square of the ground-state wave function can be\nextracted from the correlation functions within our approach. The relation\nbetween many-body perturbation theory and our DFT-RG approach is discussed and\nillustrated with the aid of the calculation of the second-order energy\ncorrection for a system of $N$ identical fermions interacting via a general\ntwo-body interaction. Moreover, we discuss the control of spuriously emerging\nfermion self-interactions in DFT studies within our framework. In general, our\napproach may help to guide the development of energy functionals for future\nquantitative DFT studies of heavy nuclei from microscopic interactions.\n", "  Starburst galaxies and star-forming regions in the Milkyway, with high rate\nof supernova activities, are candidate sources of high-energy neutrinos. Using\na gamma-ray selected sample of these sources we perform statistical analysis of\ntheir angular correlation with the four-year sample of high-energy starting\nevents (HESE), detected by the IceCube Neutrino Observatory. We find that the\ntwo samples (starburst galaxies and local star-forming regions) are correlated\nwith cosmic neutrinos at $\\sim (2-3)\\sigma$ (pre-trial) significance level,\nwhen the full HESE sample with deposited energy $\\gtrsim 20$~TeV is considered.\nHowever when we consider the HESE sample with deposited energy $\\gtrsim\n60$~TeV, which is almost free of atmospheric neutrino and muon backgrounds, the\nsignificance of correlation decreased drastically. We perform a similar study\nfor Galactic sources in the 2nd Catalog of Hard {\\em Fermi}-LAT Sources (2FHL,\n$>50$~ GeV) catalog as well, obtaining $\\sim (2-3)\\sigma$ (pre-trial)\ncorrelation, however the significance of correlation increases with higher\ncutoff energy in the HESE sample for this case. We also fit available gamma-ray\ndata from these sources using a $pp$ interaction model and calculate expected\nneutrino fluxes. We find that the expected neutrino fluxes for most of the\nsources are at least an order of magnitude lower than the fluxes required to\nproduce the HESE neutrinos from these sources. This puts the starburst sources\nbeing the origin of the IceCube HESE neutrinos in question.\n", "  We present the basic concepts and recent developments in the time-dependent\ndensity functional theory (TDDFT) for describing nuclear dynamics at low\nenergy. The symmetry breaking is inherent in nuclear energy density functionals\n(EDFs), which provides a practical description of important correlations at the\nground state. Properties of elementary modes of excitation are strongly\ninfluenced by the symmetry breaking and can be studied with TDDFT. In\nparticular, a number of recent developments in the linear response calculation\nhave demonstrated their usefulness in description of collective modes of\nexcitation in nuclei. Unrestricted real-time calculations have also become\navailable in recent years, with new developments for quantitative description\nof nuclear collision phenomena. There are, however, limitations in the\nreal-time approach; for instance, it cannot describe the many-body quantum\ntunneling. Thus, we treat the quantum fluctuations associated with slow\ncollective motions assuming that time evolution of densities are determined by\na few collective coordinates and momenta. The concept of collective submanifold\nis introduced in the phase space associated with the TDDFT and used to quantize\nthe collective dynamics. Selected applications are presented to demonstrate the\nusefulness and quality of the new approaches. Finally, conceptual differences\nbetween nuclear and electronic TDDFT are discussed, with some recent\napplications to studies of electron dynamics in the linear response and under a\nstrong laser field.\n", "  Biadjoint scalar theories are novel field theories that arise in the study of\nnon-abelian gauge and gravity amplitudes. In this short paper, we present exact\nnonperturbative solutions of the field equations, and compare their properties\nwith monopole-like solutions in non-abelian gauge theory. Our results may pave\nthe way for nonperturbative studies of the double copy.\n", "  We consider the effects of gravitons in the collapse of baryonic matter that\nforms a black hole. We first note that the effective number of (soft off-shell)\ngravitons that account for the (negative) Newtonian potential energy generated\nby the baryons is conserved and always in agreement with Bekenstein's area law\nof black holes. Moreover, their (positive) interaction energy reproduces the\nexpected post-Newtonian correction and becomes of the order of the total ADM\nmass of the system when the size of the collapsing object approaches its\ngravitational radius. This result supports a scenario in which the\ngravitational collapse of regular baryonic matter produces a corpuscular black\nhole without central singularity, in which both gravitons and baryons are\nmarginally bound and form a Bose-Einstein condensate at the critical point. The\nHawking emission of baryons and gravitons is then described by the quantum\ndepletion of the condensate and we show the two energy fluxes are comparable,\nalbeit negligibly small on astrophysical scales.\n", "  We explore the interaction between Hall waves and mechanical failures inside\na magnetar crust, using detailed one-dimentional models that consider\ntemperature-sensitive plastic flow, heat transport and cooling by neutrino\nemission, as well as the coupling of the crustal motion to the magnetosphere.\nWe find that the dynamics is enriched and accelerated by the fast,\nshort-wavelength Hall waves that are emitted by each failure. The waves\npropagate and cause failures elsewhere, triggering avalanches. We argue that\nthese avalanches are the likely sources of outbursts in transient magnetars.\n", "  The mass transfer in binaries with massive donors and compact companions,\nwhen the donors rapidly evolve after their main sequence, is one of the\ndominant formation channels of merging double stellar-mass black hole binaries.\nThis mass transfer was previously postulated to be unstable and was expected to\nlead to a common envelope event. The common envelope event then would end with\neither double black hole formation, or with the merger of the two stars. We\nre-visit the stability of this mass transfer, and find that for a large range\nof the binary orbital separations this mass transfer is stable. This newly\nfound stability allows us to reconcile the theoretical rate for double black\nhole binary mergers predicted by population synthesis studies, and the\nempirical rate obtained by LIGO. Futhermore, the stability of the mass transfer\nleads to the formation of ultra-luminous X-ray sources. The theoretically\npredicted formation rates of ultra-luminous X-ray sources powered by a\nstellar-mass BH, as well as the range of produced X-ray luminosity, can explain\nthe observed bright ultra-luminous X-ray sources.\n", "  We study the nonlinear optical propagation of two different classes of\nspace-varying polarized light beams -- radially symmetric vector beams and\nPoincar\\'e beams with lemon and star topologies -- in a rubidium vapour cell.\nUnlike Laguerre-Gauss and other types of beams that experience modulational\ninstabilities, we observe that their propagation is not marked by beam breakup\nwhile still exhibiting traits such as nonlinear confinement and self-focusing.\nOur results suggest that by tailoring the spatial structure of the\npolarization, the effects of nonlinear propagation can be effectively\ncontrolled. These findings provide a novel approach to transport high-power\nlight beams in nonlinear media with controllable distortions to their spatial\nstructure and polarization properties.\n", "  The Silicon Tracker (STK) is a detector of the DAMPE satellite to measure the\nincidence direction of high energy cosmic ray. It consists of 6 X-Y double\nlayers of silicon micro-strip detectors with 73,728 readout channels. It's a\ngreat challenge to readout the channels and process the huge volume of data in\nthe critical space environment. 1152 Application Specific Integrated Circuits\n(ASIC) and 384 ADCs are adopted to readout the detector channels. The 192\nTracker Front-end Hybrid (TFH) modules and 8 identical Tracker Readout Board\n(TRB) modules are designed to control and digitalize the front signals. In this\npaper, the design of the readout electronics for STK and its performance will\nbe presented in detail.\n", "  Continuum spectra covering centimetre to submillimetre wavelengths are\npresented for a northern sample of 104 extragalactic radio sources, mainly\nactive galactic nuclei, based on four-epoch Planck data. The nine Planck\nfrequencies, from 30 to 857 GHz, are complemented by a set of simultaneous\nground-based radio observations between 1.1 and 37 GHz. The single-survey\nPlanck data confirm that the flattest high-frequency radio spectral indices are\nclose to zero, indicating that the original accelerated electron energy\nspectrum is much harder than commonly thought, with power-law index around 1.5\ninstead of the canonical 2.5. The radio spectra peak at high frequencies and\nexhibit a variety of shapes. For a small set of low-z sources, we find a\nspectral upturn at high frequencies, indicating the presence of intrinsic cold\ndust. Variability can generally be approximated by achromatic variations, while\nsources with clear signatures of evolving shocks appear to be limited to the\nstrongest outbursts.\n", "  Recently, an intriguing family of the one-point toric conformal blocks AGT\nrelated to the $\\mathcal{N}=2^*\\,\\, SU(2)$ Nekrasov functions was discovered by\nM. Beccaria and G. Macorini. Members of the family are distinguished by having\nonly finite amount of poles as functions of the intermediate dimension/v.e.v.\nin gauge theory. Another remarkable property is that these conformal\nblocks/Nekrasov functions can be found in closed form to all orders in the\ncoupling expansion. In the present paper we use Zamolodchikov's recurrence\nequation to systematically account for these exceptional conformal blocks. We\nconjecture that the family is infinite-dimensional and describe the\ncorresponding parameter set. We further apply the developed technique to\ndemonstrate that the four-point spheric conformal blocks feature analogous\nexact expressions. We also study the modular transformations of the finite-pole\nblocks.\n", "  We present cosmological parameter constraints from a tomographic weak\ngravitational lensing analysis of ~450deg$^2$ of imaging data from the Kilo\nDegree Survey (KiDS). For a flat $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology with a prior on $H_0$\nthat encompasses the most recent direct measurements, we find\n$S_8\\equiv\\sigma_8\\sqrt{\\Omega_{\\rm m}/0.3}=0.745\\pm0.039$. This result is in\ngood agreement with other low redshift probes of large scale structure,\nincluding recent cosmic shear results, along with pre-Planck cosmic microwave\nbackground constraints. A $2.3$-$\\sigma$ tension in $S_8$ and `substantial\ndiscordance' in the full parameter space is found with respect to the Planck\n2015 results. We use shear measurements for nearly 15 million galaxies,\ndetermined with a new improved `self-calibrating' version of $lens$fit\nvalidated using an extensive suite of image simulations. Four-band $ugri$\nphotometric redshifts are calibrated directly with deep spectroscopic surveys.\nThe redshift calibration is confirmed using two independent techniques based on\nangular cross-correlations and the properties of the photometric redshift\nprobability distributions. Our covariance matrix is determined using an\nanalytical approach, verified numerically with large mock galaxy catalogues. We\naccount for uncertainties in the modelling of intrinsic galaxy alignments and\nthe impact of baryon feedback on the shape of the non-linear matter power\nspectrum, in addition to the small residual uncertainties in the shear and\nredshift calibration. The cosmology analysis was performed blind. Our\nhigh-level data products, including shear correlation functions, covariance\nmatrices, redshift distributions, and Monte Carlo Markov Chains are available\nat http://kids.strw.leidenuniv.nl.\n", "  The fully packed loop (FPL) model is a statistical model related to the\nintegrable $U_q(\\hat{\\mathfrak{sl}}_3)$ vertex model. In this paper we study\nthe continuum limit of the FPL. With the appropriate weight of non-contractible\nloops, we give evidence of an extended $W_3$ symmetry in the continuum. The\npartition function on the torus is calculated exactly, yielding new modular\ninvariants of $W_3$ characters. The full CFT spectrum is obtained, and is found\nto be in excellent agreement with exact diagonalisation.\n", "  New model of the pinning potential barrier in multi-layered HTc\nsuperconductors has been presented, basing on geometrical approach to the\ncapturing interaction of pancake type vortices with nano-scale defects. Using\nthis model the transport current flow phenomena in these materials, especially\ncurrent-voltage characteristics and critical current density, have been\nconsidered. Details of theoretical analysis are given, including derivation of\nbasic mathematical equations describing the potential barrier in the function\nof transport current density and initial position of captured pancake vortex.\nComputer simulation has been performed then of influence of transport current\namplitude on potential barrier height for various sizes of pinning centers and\ninitial pancake vortex position as well as influence of fast neutrons\nirradiation on critical current of HTc layered superconductor.\n", "  We show that the Fu-Kane-Mele invariant of the 2d time-reversal-invariant\ncrystalline insulators is equal to the properly normalized Wess-Zumino action\nof the so-called sewing matrix field defined on the Brillouin torus. Applied to\n3d, the result permits a direct proof of the known relation between the strong\nFu-Kane-Mele invariant and the Chern-Simons action of the non-Abelian Berry\nconnection on the bundle of valence states.\n", "  In this work we investigated the longitudinal (zonal) variability of H$_2$O\nand ammonia (NH$_3$) hydrate ices on the surface of Charon through analysis of\nthe 1.65 $\\mu$m and 2.21 $\\mu$m absorption features, respectively.\nNear-infrared spectra presented here were obtained between 2015-07-14 and\n2015-08-30 UT with the OSIRIS integral field spectrograph on Keck I. Spectra\ncentered on six different sub-observer longitudes were obtained through the Hbb\n(1.473-1.803 $\\mu$m) and Kbb (1.965-2.381 $\\mu$m) filters. Gaussian functions\nwere fit to the aforementioned bands to obtain information on band center, band\ndepth, full width at half maximum, and band area. The shift in the band center\nof the temperature-dependent 1.65 $\\mu$m feature was used to calculate the\nH$_2$O ice temperature. The mean temperature of the ice on the observable\nportion of Charon's surface is 45$\\pm$14 K and we report no statistically\nsignificant variations in temperature across the surface. We hypothesize that\nthe crystalline and amorphous phases of water ice reached equilibrium over 3.5\nGyr ago, with thermal recrystallization balancing the effects of irradiation\namorphization. We do not believe that cryovolcanism is necessary to explain the\npresence of crystalline water ice on the surface of Charon. Absorption from\nammonia species is detected between 12$^{\\circ}$ and 290$^{\\circ}$, in\nagreement with results from New Horizons. Ongoing diffusion of ammonia through\nthe rocky mantle and upper layer of water ice is one possible mechanism for\nmaintaining its presence in Charon's surface ice. Reduced Charon spectra\ncorrected for telluric and solar absorption are available as supplementary\nonline material.\n", "  Context. The Spectroscopy Made Easy (SME) package has become a popular tool\nfor analyzing stellar spectra, often in connection with large surveys or\nexoplanet research. SME has evolved significantly since it was first described\nin 1996, but many of the original caveats and potholes still haunt users. The\nmain drivers for this paper are complexity of the modeling task, the large user\ncommunity, and the massive effort that has gone into SME.\n  Aims. We do not intend to give a comprehensive introduction to stellar\natmospheres, but will describe changes to key components of SME: the equation\nof state, opacities, and radiative transfer. We will describe the analysis and\nfitting procedure and investigate various error sources that affect inferred\nparameters.\n  Methods. We review the current status of SME, emphasizing new algorithms and\nmethods. We describe some best practices for using the package, based on\nlessons learned over two decades of SME usage. We present a new way to assess\nuncertainties in derived stellar parameters.\n  Results. Improvements made to SME, better line data, and new model\natmospheres yield more realistic stellar spectra, but in many cases systematic\nerrors still dominate over measurement uncertainty. Future enhancements are\noutlined.\n", "  Degrees of freedom that carry black hole entropy and hair can be described in\nthe language of Goldstone phenomenon. They represent the pseudo-Goldstone\nbosons of certain supertranslations, called A-transformations, that are\nspontaneously broken by the black hole metric. This breaking gives rise to a\ntower of Goldstone bosons created by the spontaneously-broken generators that\ncan be labeled by spherical harmonics. Classically, the number of charges is\ninfinite, they have vanishing VEVs and the corresponding Goldstone modes are\ngapless. The resulting hair and entropy are infinite, but unresolvable. In\nquantum theory the two things happen. The number of legitimate Goldstone modes\nrestricted by requirement of weak-coupling, becomes finite and scales as black\nhole area in Planck units. The Goldstones generate a tiny gap, controlled by\ntheir gravitational coupling. The gap turns out to be equal to the inverse of\nblack hole half-life, $t_{BH}$. Correspondingly, in quantum theory the charges\nare neither conserved nor vanish, but non-conservation time is set by $t_{BH}$.\nThis picture nicely matches with the idea of a black hole as of critical system\ncomposed of many soft gravitons. The A-Goldstones of geometric picture\nrepresent the near-gapless Bogoliubov-Goldstone modes of critical soft-graviton\nsystem.\n", "  We study transport and zero frequency shot noise properties of a normal\nmetal-superconductor-normal metal (NSN) junction, with the superconductor\nhaving mixed singlet and chiral triplet pairings. We show that in the subgapped\nregime when the chiral triplet pairing amplitude dominates over that of the\nsinglet, a resonance phenomena emerges out at zero energy where all the quantum\nmechanical scattering probabilities acquire a value of 0.25. At the resonance,\ncrossed Andreev reflection mediating through such junction, acquires a zero\nenergy peak. This reflects as a zero energy peak in the conductance as well\ndepending on the doping concentration. We also investigate shot noise for this\nsystem and show that shot noise cross-correlation is negative in the subgapped\nregime when the triplet pairing dominates over the singlet one. The latter is\nin sharp contrast to the positive shot noise obtained when the singlet pairing\nis the dominating one.\n", "  In this paper we study Kac's 1D particle system, consisting of the velocities\nof $N$ particles colliding at constant rate and randomly exchanging energies.\nWe prove uniform (in time) propagation of chaos in Wasserstein distance with\nexplicit polynomial rates in $N$, for both the squared (i.e., the energy) and\nnon-squared particle system. These rates are of order $N^{-1/3}$ (almost, in\nthe non-squared case), assuming that the initial distribution of the limit\nnonlinear equation has finite moments of sufficiently high order ($4+\\epsilon$\nis enough when using the 2-Wasserstein distance). The proof relies on a\nconvenient parametrization of the collision recently introduced by Hauray, as\nwell as on a coupling technique developed by Cortez and Fontbona.\n", "  We measured the temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility and\nspecific heat and the magnetic-field dependence of the magnetization of\nCuInVO$_5$. An antiferromagnetically ordered state appears below $T_{\\rm N} =\n2.7$ K. We observed a $\\frac{1}{2}$ quantum magnetization plateau above 30 T at\n1.3 K. We show that the spin system consists of antiferromagnetic\nspin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ tetramers with $J_1 = 240 \\pm 20$ and $J_2 = -142 \\pm 10$ K\nfor the intratetramer interactions.\n", "  In whispering gallery mode resonator sensing applications, the conventional\nway to detect a change in the parameter to be measured is by observing the\nsteady state transmission spectrum through the coupling waveguide.\nAlternatively, cavity ring-up spectroscopy (CRUS) sensing can be achieved\ntransiently. In this work, we investigate CRUS using coupled mode equations and\nfind analytical solutions with a large spectral broadening approximation of the\ninput pulse. The relationships between the frequency detuning, coupling gap and\nring-up peak height are determined and experimentally verified using an\nultrahigh \\textit{Q}-factor silica microsphere. This work shows that\ndistinctive dispersive and dissipative transient sensing can be realised by\nsimply measuring the peak height of the CRUS signal, which might improve the\ndata collection rate.\n", "  The Vlasov-Maxwell equations possess a Hamiltonian structure expressed in\nterms of a Hamiltonian functional and a functional bracket. In the present\npaper, the transformation (\"lift\") of the Vlasov-Maxwell bracket induced by the\ndynamical reduction of single-particle dynamics is investigated when the\nreduction is carried out by Lie-transform perturbation methods. The ultimate\ngoal of this work is to derive explicit Hamiltonian formulations for the\nguiding-center and gyrokinetic Vlasov-Maxwell equations that have important\napplications in our understanding of turbulent magnetized plasmas. Here, it is\nshown that the general form of the reduced Vlasov-Maxwell equations possesses a\nHamiltonian structure defined in terms of a reduced Hamiltonian functional and\na reduced bracket that automatically satisfies the standard bracket properties.\n", "  The interchange dynamics and velocity scaling of blob-like plasma filaments\nare investigated using a two-field reduced fluid model. For incompressible\nflows due to buoyancy the maximum velocity is proportional to the square root\nof the relative amplitude and the square root of its cross-field size. For\ncompressible flows in a non-uniform magnetic field this square root scaling\nonly holds for ratios of amplitudes to cross-field sizes above a certain\nthreshold value. For small amplitudes and large sizes, the maximum velocity is\nproportional to the filament amplitude. The acceleration is proportional to the\namplitude and independent of the cross-field size in all regimes. This is\ndemonstrated by means of numerical simulations and explained by the energy\nintegrals satisfied by the model.\n", "  The property of limiting fragmentation of various observables such as\nrapidity distributions ($dN/dy$), elliptic flow ($v_{2}$), average transverse\nmomentum ($\\langle p_{T} \\rangle$) etc. of charged particles is observed when\nthey are plotted as a function of rapidity ($y$) shifted by the beam rapidity\n($y_{beam}$) for a wide range of energies from AGS to RHIC. Limiting\nfragmentation (LF) is a well studied phenomenon as observed in various\ncollision energies and colliding systems experimentally. It is very interesting\nto verify this phenomenon theoretically. We study such a phenomenon for pion\nrapidity spectra using our hydrodynamic-like model where the collective flow is\nincorporated in a thermal model in the longitudinal direction. Our findings\nadvocate the observation of extended longitudinal scaling in the rapidity\nspectra of pions from AGS to lower RHIC energies, while it is observed to be\nviolated at top RHIC and LHC energies. Prediction of LF hypothesis for Pb+Pb\ncollisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$=5.02 TeV is given.\n", "  We have obtained a closed-form expression for the threshold of\nRisken-Nummedal-Graham-Haken (RNGH) multimode instability in a Fabry-P\\'erot\n(FP) cavity quantum cascade laser (QCL). This simple analytical expression is a\nversatile tool that can easily be applied in practical situations which require\nanalysis of QCL dynamic behavior and estimation of its second threshold. Our\nmodel for a FP cavity laser accounts for the carrier coherence grating and\ncarrier population grating as well as their relaxation due to carrier\ndiffusion. In the model, the RNGH instability threshold is analyzed using a\nsecond-order bi-orthogonal perturbation theory and we confirm our analytical\nsolution by a comparison with the numerical simulations. In particular, the\nmodel predicts a low second threshold in QCLs. This agrees very well with\nexperimental data available in the literature.\n", "  We review a semi-microscopic model of nuclear parton distributions, which\ntakes into account a number of nuclear effects including Fermi motion and\nnuclear binding, nuclear meson-exchange currents and off-shell corrections to\nbound nucleon distributions as well as nuclear shadowing effect. We also\ndiscuss applications of the model to the lepton-nuclear deep-inelastic\nscattering, Drell-Yan process and neutrino total cross sections.\n", "  In this paper we discuss Bagger-Witten line bundles over moduli spaces of\nSCFTs. We review how in general they are `fractional' line bundles, not honest\nline bundles, twisted on triple overlaps. We discuss the special case of moduli\nspaces of elliptic curves in detail. There, the Bagger-Witten line bundle does\nnot exist as an ordinary line bundle, but rather is necessarily fractional. As\na fractional line bundle, it is nontrivial (though torsion) over the\nuncompactified moduli stack, and its restriction to the interior, excising\ncorners with enhanced stabilizers, is also fractional. It becomes an honest\nline bundle on a moduli stack defined by a quotient of the upper half plane by\na metaplectic group, rather than SL(2,Z). We review and compare to results of\nrecent work arguing that well-definedness of the worldsheet metric implies that\nthe Bagger-Witten line bundle admits a flat connection (which includes torsion\nbundles as special cases), and give general arguments on the existence of\nuniversal structures on moduli spaces of SCFTs, in which superconformal\ndeformation parameters are promoted to nondynamical fields ranging over the\nSCFT moduli space.\n", "  In a diffraction-limited storage ring (DLSR), the momentum acceptance (MA)\nmight be limited by the half integer resonances (HIRs) excited by focusing\nerrors, associated with the large detuning terms from the strong focusing and\nstrong sextupoles required for an ultralow emittance. Taking the High Energy\nPhoton Source (HEPS) as an example and through statistical analysis, we found\nthat the horizontal HIRs have stronger impact on dynamics than the vertical\nones; and the probability of MA reduction caused by a HIR is closely correlated\nwith the level of the beta beats at the same plane, but independent of the\nerror sources. For the HEPS design, to reach a small MA-reduction probability\nof about 1%, the rms amplitude of the beta beats at the nominal tunes should be\nkept below 1.5% horizontally and 2.5% vertically. The presented analysis can\nprovide useful reference for other DLSR designs.\n", "  The origin of prompt emission from gamma ray bursts remains to be an open\nquestion. Correlated prompt optical and gamma-ray emission observed in a\nhandful of GRBs strongly suggests a common emission region, but failure to\nadequately fit the broadband GRB spectrum prompted the hypothesis of different\nemission mechanisms for the low- and high-energy radiations. We demonstrate\nthat our multi-component model for GRB gamma-ray prompt emission provides an\nexcellent fit to GRB 110205A from optical to gamma-ray energies. Our results\nshow that the optical and highest gamma-ray emissions have the same spatial and\nspectral origin, which is different from the bulk of the X- and softest\ngamma-ray radiation. Finally, our accurate redshift estimate for GRB 110205A\ndemonstrates promise for using GRBs as cosmological standard candles.\n", "  We describe a weak lensing view of the downsizing of star forming galaxies\nbased on cross correlating a weak lensing ($\\kappa$) map with a predicted map\nconstructed from a redshift survey. Moderately deep and high resolution images\nwith Subaru/Hyper Suprime-Cam covering the 4 deg^2 DLS F2 field provide a\n$\\kappa$ map with 1 arcmin resolution. A dense complete redshift survey of the\nF2 field including 12,705 galaxies with $R\\leq20.6$ is the basis for\nconstruction of the predicted map. The zero-lag cross-correlation between the\n\\kappa and predicted maps is significant at the $30\\sigma$ level. The width of\nthe cross-correlation peak is comparable with the angular scale of rich cluster\nat $z\\sim0.3$, the median depth of the redshift survey. Slices of the predicted\nmap in $\\delta{z} = 0.05$ redshift bins enable exploration of the impact of\nstructure as a function of redshift. The zero-lag normalised cross-correlation\nhas significant local maxima at redshifts coinciding with known massive X-ray\nclusters. Even in slices where there are no known massive clusters, there is\nsignificant signal in the cross-correlation originating from lower mass groups\nthat trace the large-scale of the universe. Spectroscopic $D_n4000$\nmeasurements enable division of the sample into star-forming and quiescent\npopulations. The significance of the cross-correlation with structure\ncontaining star-forming galaxies increases with redshift from $5\\sigma$ at $z =\n0.3$ to $7 \\sigma$ at $z = 0.5$. The weak lensing results are consistent with\nthe downsizing view of galaxy evolution established on the basis of many other\nindependent studies.\n", "  The latest achievements in the fabrication of black phosphorus thin layers,\ntowards the technological breakthrough of a phosphorene atomically thin layer,\nare paving the way for a their employment in electronics, optics, and\noptoelectronics. In this work, we have simulated the optical properties of\none-dimensional photonic structures, i.e. photonic crystals and microcavities,\nin which few-layer black phosphorus is one of the components. The insertion of\nthe 5 nm black phosphorous layers leads to a photonic band gap in the photonic\ncrystals and a cavity mode in the microcavity interesting for light\nmanipulation and emission enhancement.\n", "  We generalize the Kuramoto model for the synchronization transition of\nglobally coupled phase oscillators to populations by incorporating an\nadditional heterogeneity with the coupling strength, where each oscillator pair\ninteracts with different coupling strength weighted by a genera; function of\ntheir natural frequency. The expression for the critical coupling can be\nstraightforwardly extended to a generalized explicit formula analytically, and\ns self-consistency approach is developed to predict the stationary states in\nthe thermodynamic limit. The landau damping effect is further revealed by means\nof the linear stability analysis and resonance poles theory above the critical\nthreshold which turns to be far more generic. Furthermore, the dimensionality\nreduction technique of the Ott-Antonsen is implemented to capture the\nanalytical description of relaxation dynamics of the steady states valid on a\nglobally attracting manifold. Our theoretical analysis and numerical results\nare consistent with each other, which can help us understand the\nsynchronization transition in general networks with heterogenous couplings.\n", "  High temperature superconducting (HTS) bulks or stacks of coated conductors\n(CCs) can be magnetized to become trapped field magnets (TFMs). The magnetic\nfields of such TFMs can break the limitation of conventional magnets (<2 T), so\nthey show potential for improving the performance of many electrical\napplications that use permanent magnets like rotating machines. Towards\npractical or commercial use of TFMs, effective in situ magnetization is one of\nthe key issues. The pulsed field magnetization (PFM) is among the most\npromising magnetization methods in virtue of its compactness, mobility and low\ncost. However, due to the heat generation during the magnetization, the trapped\nfield and flux acquired by PFM usually cannot achieve the full potential of a\nsample (acquired by the field cooling or zero field cooling method). The\nmulti-pulse technique was found to effectively improve the trapped field by PFM\nin practice. In this work, a systematic study on the PFM with successive pulses\nis presented. A 2D electromagnetic-thermal coupled model with comprehensive\ntemperature dependent parameters is used to simulate a stack of CCs magnetized\nby successive magnetic pulses. An overall picture is built to show how the\ntrapped field and flux evolve with different pulse sequences and the evolution\npatterns are analyzed. Based on the discussion, an operable magnetization\nstrategy of PFM with successive pulses is suggested to provide more trapped\nfield and flux. Finally, experimental results of a stack of CCs magnetized by\ntypical pulse sequences are presented for demonstration.\n", "  Using an approach based on Soft Collinear Effective Theory (SCET) and Heavy\nQuark Effective Theory (HQET) we determine the $b$-quark fragmentation function\nfrom electron-positron annihilation data at the $Z$-boson peak at\nnext-to-next-to leading order, with next-to-next-to leading log resummation of\nDGLAP logarithms, and next-to-next-to-next-to leading log resummation of\nendpoint logarithms. This analysis improves, by one order, the previous\nextraction of the $b$-quark fragmentation function. We find that while the\naddition of the next order in the calculation does not much shift the extracted\nform of the fragmentation function, it does reduce theoretical errors\nindicating that the expansion is converging. Using an approach based on\neffective field theory allows us to systematically control theoretical errors.\nWhile the fits of theory to data are generally good, the fits seem to be\nhinting that higher order correction from HQET may be needed to explain the\n$b$-quark fragmentation function at smaller values of momentum fraction.\n", "  We construct exactly solvable models for a wide class of symmetry enriched\ntopological (SET) phases. Our construction applies to 2D bosonic SET phases\nwith finite unitary onsite symmetry group $G$ and we conjecture that our models\nrealize every phase in this class that can be described by a commuting\nprojector Hamiltonian. Our models are designed so that they have a special\nproperty: if we couple them to a dynamical lattice gauge field with gauge group\n$G$, the resulting gauge theories are equivalent to modified string-net models.\nThis property is what allows us to analyze our models in generality. As an\nexample, we present a model for a phase with the same anyon excitations as the\ntoric code and with a $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry which exchanges the $e$ and $m$\ntype anyons. We further illustrate our construction with a number of additional\nexamples.\n", "  Anomaly-free perturbations of loop quantum cosmology with holonomy\ncorrections reveal an $\\Omega$ -deformed spacetime structure,\n$\\Omega:=1-2\\rho/\\rho_c$, where $\\Omega<0$ indicates a Euclidean-like space and\n$\\Omega>0$ indicates a Lorentz-like space. It would be reasonable to give the\ninitial value at the spacetime transition point, $\\rho=\\rho_c/2$, but we find\nthat it is impossible to define a Minkowski-like vacuum even for large $k$\nmodes at that time. However, if we loosen the condition and give the initial\nvalue slightly after $\\Omega=0$, e.g., $\\Omega\\simeq 0.2$, the vacuum state can\nbe well defined and, furthermore the slow roll approximation also works well in\nthat region. Both scalar and tensor spectra are considered in the framework of\nloop quantum cosmology with holonomy corrections. We find that if the energy\ndensity is not too small in relation to $\\rho_c/2$ when the considered $k$ mode\ncrossing the horizon, effective theory can give a much smaller scalar power\nspectrum than classical theory and the spectrum of tensor perturbations could\nblueshift. But when compared to other observations, since the energy densities\nwhen the modes crossed the horizon were significantly smaller than $\\rho_c$,the\nresults we get agree with previous work in the literature and with the\nclassical inflation theory.\n", "  High statistics measurements of the photon asymmetry $\\mathrm{\\Sigma}$ for\nthe $\\overrightarrow{\\gamma}$p$\\rightarrow\\pi^{0}$p reaction have been made in\nthe center of mass energy range W=1214-1450 MeV. The data were measured with\nthe MAMI A2 real photon beam and Crystal Ball/TAPS detector systems in Mainz,\nGermany. The results significantly improve the existing world data and are\nshown to be in good agreement with previous measurements, and with the MAID,\nSAID, and Bonn-Gatchina predictions. We have also combined the photon asymmetry\nresults with recent cross-section measurements from Mainz to calculate the\nprofile functions, $\\check{\\mathrm{\\Sigma}}$ (= $\\sigma_{0}\\mathrm{\\Sigma}$),\nand perform a moment analysis. Comparison with calculations from the\nBonn-Gatchina model shows that the precision of the data is good enough to\nfurther constrain the higher partial waves, and there is an indication of\ninterference between the very small $F$-waves and the $N(1520) 3/2^{-}$ and\n$N(1535) 1/2^{-}$ resonances.\n", "  We present a purely geometric renormalization scheme for metric spaces\n(including uncolored graphs), which consists of a coarse graining and a\nrescaling operation on such spaces. The coarse graining is based on the concept\nof quasi-isometry, which yields a sequence of discrete coarse grained spaces\neach having a continuum limit under the rescaling operation. We provide\ncriteria under which such sequences do converge within a superspace of metric\nspaces, or may constitute the basin of attraction of a common continuum limit,\nwhich hopefully, may represent our space-time continuum.\n  We discuss some of the properties of these coarse grained spaces as well as\ntheir continuum limits, such as scale invariance and metric similarity, and\nshow that different layers of spacetime can carry different distance functions\nwhile being homeomorphic.\n  Important tools in this analysis are the Gromov-Hausdorff distance functional\nfor general metric spaces and the growth degree of graphs or networks. The\nwhole construction is in the spirit of the Wilsonian renormalization group.\n  Furthermore we introduce a physically relevant notion of dimension on the\nspaces of interest in our analysis, which e.g. for regular lattices reduces to\nthe ordinary lattice dimension. We show that this dimension is stable under the\nproposed coarse graining procedure as long as the latter is sufficiently local,\ni.e. quasi-isometric, and discuss the conditions under which this dimension is\nan integer. We comment on the possibility that the limit space may turn out to\nbe fractal in case the dimension is non-integer. At the end of the paper we\nbriefly mention the possibility that our network carries a translocal far-order\nwhich leads to the concept of wormhole spaces and a scale dependent dimension\nif the coarse graining procedure is no longer local.\n", "  We discuss applications of a recently developed method for model reduction\nbased on linear response theory of weakly coupled dynamical systems. We apply\nthe weak coupling method to simple stochastic differential equations with slow\nand fast degrees of freedom. The weak coupling model reduction method results\nin general in a non-Markovian system, we therefore discuss the Markovianization\nof the system to allow for straightforward numerical integration. We compare\nthe applied method to the equations obtained through homogenization in the\nlimit of large time scale separation between slow and fast degrees of freedom.\nWe look at ensemble spread from a fixed initial condition, correlation\nfunctions and exit times from domain. The weak coupling method gives better\nresults in all test cases, albeit with a higher numerical cost.\n", "  We present an explicit representation for the matrix product ansatz for some\ntwo-species TASEP with open boundary conditions. The construction relies on the\nintegrability of the models, a property that constrains the possible rates at\nthe boundaries. The realisation is built on a tensor product of copies of the\nDEHP algebras. Using this explicit construction, we are able to calculate the\npartition function of the models. The densities and currents in the stationary\nstate are also computed. It leads to the phase diagram of the models. Depending\non the values of the boundary rates, we obtain for each species shock waves,\nmaximal current, or low/high densities phases.\n", "  There is suggested a version of the experiment with a correlated pair of\nparticles in the entangled state. The experiment demonstrates that, in the case\nof weak and/or non-demolition measurements of one of the particles, it is\npossible to transmit information with a speed not limited by velocity of light.\n", "  With an increasing coupling between light and mechanics, nonlinearities begin\nto play an important role in optomechanics. We solve the quantum dynamics of an\noptomechanical system in the multi-photon strong coupling regime retaining\nnonlinear terms. This is achieved by performing a Schrieffer-Wolff\ntransformation on the Hamiltonian including driving terms. The approach is\nvalid away from the red- and blue-sideband drive. We show that the mechanical\nresonator displays self-sustained oscillations in regimes where the linearized\nmodel predicts instabilities, and that the amplitude of these oscillations is\nlimited by the nonlinear terms. Related oscillations of the photon number are\npresent due to frequency mixing of the shifted mechanical and cavity\nfrequencies. This leads to additional peaks in the cavity's power spectral\ndensity. Furthermore, we show that it is possible to create phonon states with\nsub-Poissonian statistics when the system is red-detuned. This result is valid\neven with strong driving and with initial coherent states.\n", "  Origen2.1 is a widely used computer code for calculating the burnup, decay,\nand processing of radioactive materials. However, the nuclide library of\nOrigen2.1 is used for existing reactors like pressurized water reactor, to\ncalculate the photon spectrum released by the decay of spallation products, we\nhave made specific libraries for the ADS tungsten spallation target, based on\nthe results given by a Monte Carlo code: FLUKA. All the data used to make the\nOrigen2.1 libraries is obtained from Nuclear structure & decay Data (NuDat2.6).\nThe accumulated activity of spallation products and the contribution of\nnuclides to photon emission are given in this paper.\n", "  We address a long standing problem concerning the origin of bosonic\nexcitations that strongly interact with charge carriers. We show that the\ntime-resolved pump-probe experiments are capable to distinguish between regular\nbosonic degrees of freedom, e.g. phonons, and the hard-core bosons, e.g.,\nmagnons. The ability of phonon degrees of freedom to absorb essentially\nunlimited amount of energy renders relaxation dynamics nearly independent on\nthe absorbed energy or the fluence. In contrast, the hard core effects pose\nlimits on the density of energy stored in the bosonic subsystems resulting in a\nsubstantial dependence of the relaxation time on the fluence and/or excitation\nenergy. Very similar effects can be observed also in a different setup when the\nsystem is driven by multiple pulses of equal energy.\n", "  These are notes from my lectures at TASI 2015. The goal is to provide context\nfor the study of strongly-correlated quantum many-body systems using quantum\nfield theory, and possibly string theory.\n", "  We study optical effects in quintessential Kerr black hole spacetimes\ncorresponding to the limiting case of the equation-of-state parameter\n$\\omega_{q}=-1/3$ of the quintessence. In dependence on the dimensionless\nquintessential field parameter $c$, we determine the black hole silhouette and\nthe spectral line profiles of Keplerian disks generated in this special\nquintessential Kerr geometry, representing an extension of the general\nmodifications of the Kerr geometry introduced recently by Ghasemi-Nodehi and\nBambi \\cite{Gha-Bam:2016:EPJC:}. We demonstrate that due to the influence of\nthe parameter $c$, the silhouette is almost homogeneously enlarged, and the\nspectral line profiles are redshifted with almost conserved shape.\n", "  In this paper, we recall our renormalized quantum Q-system associated with\nrepresentations of the Lie algebra $A_r$, and show that it can be viewed as a\nquotient of the quantum current algebra $U_q({\\mathfrak n}[u,u^{-1}])\\subset\nU_q(\\widehat{\\mathfrak sl}_2)$ in the Drinfeld presentation. Moreover, we find\nthe interpretation of the conserved quantities in terms of Cartan currents at\nlevel 0, and the rest of the current algebra, in a non-standard polarization in\nterms of generators in the quantum cluster algebra.\n", "  This paper unveils a mapping between a quantum fractal that describes a\nphysical phenomena, and an abstract geometrical fractal. The quantum fractal is\nthe Hofstadter butterfly discovered in 1976 in an iconic condensed matter\nproblem of electrons moving in a two-dimensional lattice in a transverse\nmagnetic field. The geometric fractal is the integer Apollonian gasket\ncharacterized in terms of a 300 BC problem of mutually tangent circles. Both of\nthese fractals are made up of integers. In the Hofstadter butterfly, these\nintegers encode the topological quantum numbers of quantum Hall conductivity.\nIn the Apollonian gaskets an infinite number of mutually tangent circles are\nnested inside each other, where each circle has integer curvature. The mapping\nbetween these two fractals reveals a hidden threefold symmetry embedded in the\nkaleidoscopic images that describe the asymptotic scaling properties of the\nbutterfly. This paper also serves as a mini review of these fractals,\nemphasizing their hierarchical aspects in terms of Farey fractions.\n", "  We report on the design and performance of small optic suspensions developed\nto suppress seismic motion of out-of-cavity optics in the Input Optics\nsubsystem of the Advanced LIGO interferometric gravitational wave detector.\nThese compact single stage suspensions provide isolation in all six degrees of\nfreedom of the optic, local sensing and actuation in three of them, and passive\ndamping for the other three.\n", "  Dark matter detectors that utilize liquid xenon have now achieved tonne-scale\ntargets, giving them sensitivity to all flavours of supernova neutrinos via\ncoherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering. Considering for the first time a\nrealistic detector model, we simulate the expected supernova neutrino signal\nfor different progenitor masses and nuclear equations of state in existing and\nupcoming dual-phase liquid xenon experiments. We show that the proportional\nscintillation signal (S2) of a dual-phase detector allows for a clear\nobservation of the neutrino signal and guarantees a particularly low energy\nthreshold, while the backgrounds are rendered negligible during the supernova\nburst. XENON1T (XENONnT and LZ; DARWIN) experiments will be sensitive to a\nsupernova burst up to 25 (35; 65) kpc from Earth at a significance of more than\n5 sigma, observing approximately 35 (123; 704) events from a 27 Msun supernova\nprogenitor at 10 kpc. Moreover, it will be possible to measure the average\nneutrino energy of all flavours, to constrain the total explosion energy, and\nto reconstruct the supernova neutrino light curve. Our results suggest that a\nlarge xenon detector such as DARWIN will be competitive with dedicated neutrino\ntelescopes, while providing complementary information that is not otherwise\naccessible.\n", "  We prove that, for M theory or type II, generic Minkowski flux backgrounds\npreserving $\\mathcal{N}$ supersymmetries in dimensions $D\\geq4$ correspond\nprecisely to integrable generalised $G_{\\mathcal{N}}$ structures, where\n$G_{\\mathcal{N}}$ is the generalised structure group defined by the Killing\nspinors. In other words, they are the analogues of special holonomy manifolds\nin $E_{d(d)} \\times\\mathbb{R}^+$ generalised geometry. In establishing this\nresult, we introduce the Kosmann-Dorfman bracket, a generalisation of Kosmann's\nLie derivative of spinors. This allows us to write down the internal sector of\nthe Killing superalgebra, which takes a rather simple form and whose closure is\nthe key step in proving the main result. In addition, we find that the\neleven-dimensional Killing superalgebra of these backgrounds is necessarily the\nsupertranslational part of the $\\mathcal{N}$-extended super-Poincar\\'e algebra.\n", "  To enhance the core heating efficiency in fast ignition laser fusion, the\nconcept of relativistic electron beam guiding by external magnetic fields was\nevaluated by integrated simulations for FIREX class targets. For the\ncone-attached shell target case, the core heating performance is deteriorated\nby applying magnetic fields since the core is considerably deformed and the\nmost of the fast electrons are reflected due to the magnetic mirror formed\nthrough the implosion. On the other hand, in the case of cone-attached solid\nball target, the implosion is more stable under the kilo-tesla-class magnetic\nfield. In addition, feasible magnetic field configuration is formed through the\nimplosion. As the results, the core heating efficiency becomes double by\nmagnetic guiding. The dependence of core heating properties on the heating\npulse shot timing was also investigated for the solid ball target.\n", "  Measuring with high precision the electrical resistance of highly ordered\nnatural graphite samples from a Brazil mine, we have identified a transition at\n$\\sim$350~K with $\\sim$40~K transition width. The step-like change in\ntemperature of the resistance, its magnetic irreversibility and time dependence\nafter a field change, consistent with trapped flux and flux creep, and the\npartial magnetic flux expulsion obtained by magnetization measurements, suggest\nthe existence of granular superconductivity below 350~K. The zero-field virgin\nstate can only be reached again after zero field cooling the sample from above\nthe transition. Paradoxically, the extraordinarily high transition temperature\nwe found for this and several other graphite samples is the reason why this\ntransition remained undetected so far. The existence of well ordered\nrhombohedral graphite phase in all measured samples has been proved by x-rays\ndiffraction measurements, suggesting its interfaces with the Bernal phase as a\npossible origin for the high-temperature superconductivity, as theoretical\nstudies predicted. The localization of granular superconductivity at these two\ndimensional interfaces prevents the observation of a zero resistance state or\nof a full Meissner state.\n", "  An event generator for diphoton ($\\gamma\\gamma$) production in hadron\ncollisions that includes associated jet production up to two jets has been\ndeveloped using a subtraction method based on the LLL subtraction. The parton\nshower (PS) simulation to restore the subtracted divergent components involves\nboth QED and QCD radiation, and QED radiation at very small $Q^{2}$ are\nsimulated by referring to a fragmentation function (FF). The PS/FF simulation\nhas the ability to enforce the radiation of a given number of energetic\nphotons. The generated events can be fed to PYTHIA to obtain particle\n(hadron)-level event information, which enables us to perform realistic\nsimulations of photon isolation and hadron-jet reconstruction. The simulated\nevents, in which the loop-mediated $gg \\rightarrow \\gamma\\gamma$ process is\ninvolved, reasonably reproduce the diphoton kinematics measured at the LHC.\nUsing the developed simulation, we found that the 2-jet processes significantly\ncontribute to diphoton production. A large 2-jet contribution can be considered\nas a common feature in electroweak-boson production in hadron collisions\nalthough the reason is yet to be understood. Discussion concerning the\ntreatment of the underlying events in photon isolation is necessary for future\nhigher precision measurements.\n", "  All-sky searches for gravitational-wave pulsars are generally limited in\nsensitivity by the finite availability of computing resources. Semicoherent\nsearches are a common method of maximizing search sensitivity given a fixed\ncomputing budget. The work of Wette and Prix [Phys. Rev. D 88, 123005 (2013)]\nand Wette [Phys. Rev. D 92, 082003 (2015)] developed a semicoherent search\nmethod which uses metrics to construct the banks of pulsar signal templates\nneeded to search the parameter space of interest. In this work we extend the\nrange of validity of the parameter-space metrics using an empirically-derived\nrelationship between the resolution (or mismatch) of the template banks and the\nmismatch of the overall search. This work has important consequences for the\noptimization of metric-based semicoherent searches at fixed computing cost.\n", "  We measure the vertical velocities of elevators, pedestrians climbing stairs,\nand drones (flying unmanned aerial vehicles), by means of smartphone pressure\nsensors. The barometric pressure obtained with the smartphone is related to the\naltitude of the device via the hydrostatic approximation. From the altitude\nvalues, vertical velocities are derived. The approximation considered is valid\nin the first hundred meters of the inner layers of the atmosphere. In addition\nto pressure, acceleration values were also recorded using the built-in\naccelerometer. Numerical integration was performed, obtaining both vertical\nvelocity and altitude. We show that data obtained using the pressure sensor is\nsignificantly less noisy than that obtained using the accelerometer. Error\naccumulation is also evident in the numerical integration of the acceleration\nvalues. In the proposed experiments, the pressure sensor also outperforms GPS,\nbecause this sensor does not receive satellite signals indoors and, in general,\nthe operating frequency is considerably lower than that of the pressure sensor.\nIn the cases in which it is possible, comparison with reference values taken\nfrom the architectural plans of buildings validates the results obtained using\nthe pressure sensor. This proposal is ideally performed as an external or\noutreach activity with students to gain insight about fundamental questions in\nmechanics, fluids, and thermodynamics.\n", "  We review our studies of spectator-induced electromagnetic (EM) effects on\nthe emission of charged mesons in the final state of ultrarelativistic heavy\nion collisions. We argue that these effects offer sensitivity to the distance\n$d_E$ between the charged meson formation zone at freeze-out and the spectator\nsystem. As such, they can serve as an independent, new tool to probe the\nspace-time and longitudinal evolution of the system created in the collision.\nAs a phenomenological application for this tool in the context of resonance\nproduction and decay, we obtain a first estimate of the time of pion emission\nfrom EM effects. This we compare to existing HBT data.\n", "  The conductivity of vortex lattices in multiband superconductors with high\nconcentration of impurities is calculated based on microscopic kinetic theory.\nBoth the limits of high and low fields are considered, when the magnetic\ninduction is close to or much smaller than the critical field strength\n$H_{c2}$, respectively. It is shown that in contrast to single-band\nsuperconductors the resistive properties are not universal but depend on the\npairing constants and ratios of diffusivities in different bands. The low-field\nmagneto-resistance can strongly exceed Bardeen-Stephen estimation in a\nquantitative agreement with experimental data for two-band superconductor\nMgB$_2$.\n", "  The N=3 Kazama-Suzuki model at the `critical' level has been found by\nCreutzig, Hikida and Ronne. We construct the lowest higher spin currents of\nspins (3/2, 2,2,2,5/2, 5/2, 5/2, 3) in terms of various fermions. In order to\nobtain the operator product expansions (OPEs) between these higher spin\ncurrents, we describe three N=2 OPEs between the two N=2 higher spin currents\ndenoted by (3/2, 2, 2, 5/2) and (2, 5/2, 5/2, 3) (corresponding 36 OPEs in the\ncomponent approach). Using the various Jacobi identities, the coefficient\nfunctions appearing on the right hand side of these N=2 OPEs are determined in\nterms of central charge completely. Then we describe them as one single N=3 OPE\nin the N=3 superspace. The right hand side of this N=3 OPE contains the\nSO(3)-singlet N=3 higher spin multiplet of spins (2, 5/2, 5/2, 5/2, 3,3,3,\n7/2), the SO(3)-singlet N=3 higher spin multiplet of spins (5/2, 3,3,3, 7/2,\n7/2, 7/2, 4), and the SO(3)-triplet N=3 higher spin multiplets where each\nmultiplet has the spins (3, 7/2, 7/2, 7/2, 4,4,4, 9/2), in addition to N=3\nsuperconformal family of the identity operator. Finally, by factoring out the\nspin-1/2 current of N=3 linear superconformal algebra generated by eight\ncurrents of spins (1/2, 1,1,1, 3/2, 3/2, 3/2, 2), we obtain the extension of\nso-called SO(3) nonlinear Knizhnik Bershadsky algebra.\n", "  Accurate Monte Carlo simulations for high-energy events at CERN's Large\nHadron Collider, are very expensive, both from the computing and storage points\nof view. We describe a method that allows to consistently re-use parton-level\nsamples accurate up to NLO in QCD under different theoretical hypotheses. We\nimplement it in MadGraph5_aMC@NLO and show its validation by applying it to\nseveral cases of practical interest for the search of new physics at the LHC.\n", "  We perform the leading one-loop renormalization of the chiral Lagrangian for\nspinless matter fields living in the fundamental representation of SU(N). The\nLagrangian can also be applied to any theory with a spontaneous symmetry\nbreaking of $SU(N)_L\\times SU(N)_R$ to $SU(N)_V$ and spinless matter fields in\nthe fundamental representation. For QCD, the matter fields can be kaons or\npseudoscalar heavy mesons. Using the background field method and heat kernel\nexpansion techniques, the divergences of the one-loop effective generating\nfunctional for correlation functions of single matter fields are calculated up\nto $\\mathcal{O}(p^3)$. They are absorbed by counterterms not only from the\nthird order but also from the second order chiral Lagrangian.\n", "  The amplitude for $\\gamma p \\to V p$, where $V$ is a $J/\\psi$ or $\\Upsilon$\nground state or excited vector meson, is calculated in a pQCD\n$k_{T}$-factorization approach. We use this amplitude to predict the cross\nsection for exclusive photoproduction of $J/\\psi, \\psi', \\Upsilon$ mesons in\nproton-proton collisions. Calculations are performed for a variety of\nunintegrated gluon distributions, and we compare our results to LHCb data. Here\nwe especially focus on the possibilty of constraining saturation effects.\nCompared to earlier calculations we include both Dirac and Pauli\nelectromagnetic form factors. We discuss the role of the $Q\\bar Q$ light-cone\nwave functions for differential distributions for ratios such as\n$\\sigma(\\psi')/\\sigma(J/\\psi)$. Absorption effects are always taken into\naccount.\n  We also discuss the related diffractive production in proton dissociative\nevents. Here we concentrate on electromagnetic dissociation , which is\ncalculable without additional free parameters. Besides being of interest in\ntheir own right, dissociative events constitute an important experimental\nbackground to exclusive production.\n", "  We study persistence probabilities for random walks in correlated Gaussian\nrandom environment first studied by Oshanin, Rosso and Schehr. From the\npersistence results, we can deduce properties of critical branching processes\nwith offspring sizes geometrically distributed with correlated random\nparameters. More precisely, we obtain estimates on the tail distribution of its\ntotal population size, of its maximum population, and of its extinction time.\n", "  We study the linear and non-linear bias parameters which determine the\nmapping between the distributions of galaxies and the full matter density\nfields, comparing different measurements and predictions. Associating galaxies\nwith dark matter haloes in the MICE Grand Challenge N-body simulation we\ndirectly measure the bias parameters by comparing the smoothed density\nfluctuations of haloes and matter in the same region at different positions as\na function of smoothing scale. Alternatively we measure the bias parameters by\nmatching the probability distributions of halo and matter density fluctuations,\nwhich can be applied to observations. These direct bias measurements are\ncompared to corresponding measurements from two-point and different third-order\ncorrelations, as well as predictions from the peak-background model, which we\npresented in previous articles using the same data. We find an overall\nvariation of the linear bias measurements and predictions of $\\sim 5 \\%$ with\nrespect to results from two-point correlations for different halo samples with\nmasses between $\\sim 10^{12} - 10^{15}$ $h^{-1}M_\\odot$ at the redshifts\n$z=0.0$ and $0.5$. Variations between the second- and third-order bias\nparameters from the different methods show larger variations, but with\nconsistent trends in mass and redshift. The various bias measurements reveal a\ntight relation between the linear and the quadratic bias parameters, which is\nconsistent with results from the literature based on simulations with different\ncosmologies. Such a universal relation might improve constraints on\ncosmological models, derived from second-order clustering statistics at small\nscales or higher-order clustering statistics.\n", "  We propose a multi-component generalization of the modified short pulse (SP)\nequation which was derived recently as a reduction of Feng's two-component SP\nequation. Above all, we address the two-component system in depth. We obtain\nthe Lax pair, an infinite nember of conservation laws and multisoliton\nsolutions for the system, demonstrating its integrability. Subsequently, we\nshow that the two-component system exhibits cusp solitons and breathers for\nwhich the detailed analysis is performed. Specifically, we explore the\ninteraction process of two cusp solitons and derive the formula for the phase\nshift. While cusp solitons are singular solutions, smooth breather solutions\nare shown to exist, provided that the parameters characterizing the solutions\nsatisfy certain condition. Last, we discuss the relation between the proposed\nsystem and existing two-component SP equations.\n", "  We study field theories with N extended non-linearly realized\nsupersymmetries, describing the couplings of models that contain N goldstini.\nWe review all the known formulations of the N=1 goldstino theories and we\ngeneralize them to an arbitrary number N of non-linearly realized\nsupersymmetries. We explicitly prove the equivalence of all these extended\nsupersymmetry breaking models containing N goldstini and reformulate the theory\nwith N supersymmetries in terms of standard N=1 constrained superfields.\n", "  Coupling at the interface of core/shell magnetic nanoparticles is known to be\nresponsible for the exchange bias (EB) and the relative sizes of core and shell\ncomponents are supposed to influence the associated phenomenology. In this\nwork, we have prepared core/shell structured nanoparticles with the total\naveraged diameter around $\\sim$ 27 nm and a wide range of shell thicknesses\nthrough the controlled oxidation of Co nanoparticles well dispersed in an\namorphous silica host. Structural characterizations give compelling evidence of\nthe formation of Co$_3$O$_4$ crystallite phase at the shells surrounding the Co\ncore. Field cooled hysteresis loops display nonmonotonous dependence of the\nexchange bias $H_E$ and coercive $H_C$ fields, that become maximum for a sample\nwith an intermediate shell thickness, at which lattice strain is also maximum\nfor both the phases. Results of our atomistic Monte Carlo simulations of the\nparticles with the same size and compositions as in experiments are in\nagreement with the experimental observations and have allowed us to identify a\nchange in the contribution of the interfacial surface spins to the\nmagnetization reversal giving rise to the maximum in $H_E$ and $H_C$.\n", "  We study a $U(1) \\times U(1)$ gauge theory discussing its vortex solutions\nand supersymmetric extension. In our set-upon the dynamics of one of two\nAbelian gauge fields is governed by a Maxwell term, the other by a Chern-Simons\nterm. The two sectors via a BF gauge field mixing and a Higgs portal term that\nconnects the two complex scalars. We also consider the supersymmetric version\nof this system which allows to find for the bosonic sector BPS equations in\nwhich an additional real scalar field enters into play. We study numerically\nthe field equations finding vortex solutions with both magnetic flux and\nelectric charge.\n", "  To make full use of photocathode material and improve its quantum efficiency\nlifetime, it can be necessary to operate laser away from the cathode center in\nphotoinjectors. In RF guns, the off-axis emitted beam will see a time-dependent\nRF effect, which would generate a significant growth in transverse emittance.\nIt has been demonstrated that such an emittance growth can be almost completely\ncompensated by orienting the beam on a proper orbit in the downstream RF\ncavities along the injector. In this paper we analyze in detail the simulation\ntechniques used in reference[1] and the issues associated with them. The\noptimization of photoinjector systems involving off-axis beams is a challenging\nproblem. To solve this problem, one needs advanced simulation tools including\nboth genetic algorithms and an efficient algorithm for 3D space charge. In this\npaper, we report on simulation studies where the two codes ASTRA and IMPACT-T\nare used jointly to overcome these challenges, in order to optimize a system\ndesigned to compensate for the emittance growth in a beam emitted off axis.\n", "  Theory of the superconductor-insulator-superconductor (S-I-S) multilayer\nstructure in superconducting accelerating cavity application is reviewed. The\ntheoretical field limit, optimum layer thicknesses and material combination,\nand surface resistance are discussed. Those for the S-S bilayer structure are\nalso reviewed.\n", "  Using the recently obtained Pgq splitting function we extend the low x\nevolution equation for gluons to account for contributions originating from\nquark-to-gluon splitting. In order to write down a consistent equation we resum\nvirtual corrections coming from the gluon channel and demonstrate that this\nimplies a suitable regularization of the Pgq singularity, corresponding to a\nsoft emitted quark. We also note that the obtained equation is in a\nstraightforward manner generalized to a nonlinear evolution equation which\ntakes into account effects due to the presence of high gluon densities.\n", "  We show that the Laurent series of the two-loop kite integral in\n$D=4-2\\varepsilon$ space-time dimensions can be expressed in each order of the\nseries expansion in terms of elliptic generalisations of (multiple)\npolylogarithms. Using differential equations we present an iterative method to\ncompute any desired order. As an example, we give the first three orders\nexplicitly.\n", "  The recent QCD calculations of the five-loop beta function and of R(e+e-) to\nO(alpha_s^4) provide one more term in the Banks-Zaks expansion in (16.5-nf).\nThere is no longer any hope that the expansion could extend, even crudely, to\nlow nf. Above nf=9, however, the results appear to be reasonably consistent\nfrom order to order.\n", "  We use the method of spectral networks to compute BPS state degeneracies in\nthe Minahan-Nemeschansky $E_6$ theory, on its Coulomb branch, without turning\non a mass deformation. The BPS multiplicities come out in representations of\nthe $E_6$ flavor symmetry. For example, along the simplest ray in\nelectromagnetic charge space, we give the first $14$ numerical degeneracies,\nand the first $7$ degeneracies as representations of $E_6$. We find a\ncomplicated spectrum, exhibiting exponential growth of multiplicities as a\nfunction of the electromagnetic charge. There is one unexpected outcome: the\nspectrum is consistent (in a nontrivial way) with the hypothesis of \"spin\npurity,\" that if a BPS state in this theory has electromagnetic charge equal to\n$n$ times a primitive charge, then it appears in a spin-$\\frac{n}{2}$\nmultiplet.\n", "  We consider \"super no-scale models\" in the framework of the heterotic string,\nwhere the N=4,2,1 --> 0 spontaneous breaking of supersymmetry is induced by\ngeometrical fluxes realizing a stringy Scherk-Schwarz perturbative mechanism.\nClassically, these backgrounds are characterized by a boson/fermion degeneracy\nat the massless level, even if supersymmetry is broken. At the 1-loop level,\nthe vacuum energy is exponentially suppressed, provided the supersymmetry\nbreaking scale is small, m_{3/2} << M_{string}. We show that the \"super\nno-scale string models\" under consideration are free of Hagedorn-like tachyonic\nsingularities, even when the supersymmetry breaking scale is large, m_{3/2} ~\nM_{string}. The vacuum energy decreases monotonically and converges\nexponentially to zero, when m_{3/2} varies from M_{string} to 0. We also show\nthat all Wilson lines associated to asymptotically free gauge symmetries are\ndynamically stabilized by the 1-loop effective potential, while those\ncorresponding to non-asymtotically free gauge groups lead to instabilities and\ncondense. The Wilson lines of the conformal gauge symmetries remain massless.\nWhen stable, the stringy super no-scale models admit low energy effective\nactions, where decoupling gravity yields theories in flat spacetime, with\nsoftly broken supersymmetry.\n", "  We suggest the possibility of a linear magnetochiral effect in time reversal\nbreaking Weyl semimetals. Generically the magnetochiral effect consists in a\nsimultaneous linear dependence of the magnetotransport coefficients with the\nmagnetic field and a momentum vector. This simultaneous dependence is allowed\nby the Onsager reciprocity relations, being the separation vector between the\nWeyl nodes the vector that plays such role. As a side consequence, we find a\nnon vanishing positive longitudinal magnetoconductivity at Fermi energies above\nthe point where the chirality of the Weyl nodes is globally lost.\n", "  In this paper, we present a theoretical study of a conjonction of\n$\\gamma$-rigid and $\\gamma$-stable collective motions in critical point\nsymmetries of the phase transitions from spherical to deformed shapes of nuclei\nusing exactly separable version of the Bohr Hamiltonian with\ndeformation-dependent mass term. The deformation-dependent mass is applied\nsimultaneously to $\\gamma$-rigid and $\\gamma$-stable parts of this famous\ncollective Hamiltonian. Moreover, the $\\beta$ part of the problem is described\nby means of Davidson potential, while the $\\gamma$-angular part corresponding\nto axially symmetric shapes is treated by a Harmonic Osillator potential. The\nenergy eigenvalues and normalized eigenfunctions of the problem are obtained in\ncompact forms by making use of the asymptotic iteration method. The combined\neffect of the deformation-dependent mass and rigidity as well as harmonic\noscillator stiffness parameters on the energy spectrum and wave functions is\nduly investigated. Also, the electric quadrupole transition ratios and energy\nsprectrum of some $\\gamma$-stable and prolate nuclei are calculated and\ncompared with the experimental data as well as with other theoretical models.\n", "  This paper considers turbulent damping of Alfven waves in magnetized plasmas.\nWe identify two cases of damping, one related to damping of cosmic rays\nstreaming instability, the other related to damping of Alfven waves emitted by\na macroscopic wave source, e.g. stellar atmosphere. The physical difference\nbetween the two cases is that in the former case the generated waves are\nemitted in respect to the local direction of magnetic field, in the latter in\nrespect to the mean field. The scaling of damping is different in the two\ncases. We the regimes of turbulence ranging from subAlfvenic to superAlfvenic\nwe obtain analytical expressions for the damping rates and define the ranges of\napplicability of these expressions. Describing the damping of the streaming\ninstability, we find that for subAlfvenic turbulence the range of cosmic ray\nenergies influenced by weak turbulence is unproportionally large compared to\nthe range of scales that the weak turbulence is present. On the contrary, the\nrange of cosmic ray energies affected by strong Alfvenic turbulence is rather\nlimited. A number of astrophysical applications of the process ranging from\nlaunching of stellar and galactic winds to propagation of cosmic rays in\ngalaxies and clusters of galaxies is considered. In particular, we discuss how\nto reconcile the process of turbulent damping with the observed isotropy of the\nMilky Way cosmic rays.\n", "  Recently the unusual metallic state with a substantially non-uniform\ndistribution of a charge and mag\\-ne\\-tic density in CoO$_2$ planes was found\nexperimentally in the Na$_x$CoO$_2$ compound with $x>0.6$. We have investigated\nan origin of such electron disproportionation in the lamellar sodium cobaltates\nby calculating the ion states as a function of a strength of the electron\ncorrelations in the $d$(Co)-shells within the GGA+U approximation for the\nsystem with a realistic crystal structure. It was found that the nonuniformity\nof spin and charge densities are induced by an ordering of the sodium cations\nand enhanced correlations. Two important magnetic states of cobalt lattice\ncompeting with each other at realistic values of the correlation parameter were\nfound~---~low spin hexagons (LS) and higher spin kagom\\'e lattice (HS-KSL). In\nthe heterogeneous metallic HS-KSL phase magnetic Co ions form a kagom\\'e\nstructure. In LS phase the kagom\\'e pattern is decomposed into hexagons and Co\nions possess minimal values of their spin. Coexistence of these states could\nexplain the emergence of the disproportionation with the peculiar kagom\\'e\nstructure experimentally revealed in previous studies of the cobaltates.\n", "  We report scanning tunnelling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM/STS) studies\non one and two unit cell (UC) high FeSe thin films grown on Bi$_2$Se$_3$(0001).\nIn our thin films, we find the tetragonal phase of FeSe and dumb-bell shaped\ndefects oriented along Se-Se bond directions. In addition, we observe striped\nmoir\\'e patterns with a periodicity of ($7.3\\pm 0.1$) nm generated by the\nmismatch between the FeSe lattice and the Bi$_2$Se$_3$ lattice. We could not\nfind any signature of a superconducting gap in the tunneling spectra measured\non the surface of one and two UC thick islands of FeSe down to 6.5 K. The\nspectra rather show an asymmetric behavior across and a finite density of\nstates at the Fermi level ($E_F$) resembling those taken in the normal state of\nbulk FeSe.\n", "  Ghost imaging is a technique -- first realized in quantum optics -- in which\nthe image emerges from cross-correlation between particles in two separate\nbeams. One beam passes through the object to a bucket (single-pixel) detector,\nwhile the second beam's spatial profile is measured by a high resolution\n(multi-pixel) detector but never interacts with the object. Neither detector\ncan reconstruct the image independently. However, until now ghost imaging has\nonly been demonstrated with photons.\n  Here we report the first realisation of ghost imaging of an object using\nmassive particles. In our experiment, the two beams are formed by correlated\npairs of ultracold metastable helium atoms, originating from two colliding\nBose-Einstein condensates (BECs) via $s$-wave scattering. We use the\nhigher-order Kapitza-Dirac effect to generate the large number of correlated\natom pairs required, enabling the creation of a ghost image with good\nvisibility and sub-millimetre resolution.\n  Future extensions could include ghost interference as well as tests of EPR\nentantlement and Bell's inequalities.\n", "  Recent studies show superconductivity provides new perspectives on\nspintronics. We study a heterostructure composed of an s-wave superconductor\nand a cubic chiral-magnet that can stabilize a topological spin texture, a\nskyrmion. We propose a supercurrent-induced spin torque that originates from\nthe spin-orbit coupling, and we show that the spin torque can drive a skyrmion\nin an efficient way that reduces Joule heating. We also study the band\nstructure of Bogoliubov quasiparticles and show the existence of Weyl points,\nwhose positions can be controlled by the direction of the magnetization. This\nresults in an effective magnetic field acting on the quasiparticles in the\npresence spin textures. Furthermore, the tilt of the Weyl cones can also be\ntuned by the strength of the spin-orbit coupling, and we propose a possible\nrealization of type-II Weyl points.\n", "  We discuss an interesting class of models, based on strongly coupled Dark\nMatter (DM), where sizable effects can be expected in LHC missing energy (MET)\nsearches, compatibly with a large separation of scales. In this case, an\neffective field theory (EFT) is appropriate (and sometimes necessary) to\ndescribe the most relevant interactions at the LHC. The selection rules implied\nby the structure of the new strong dynamics shape the EFT in an unusual way,\nrevealing the importance of higher-derivative interactions previously ignored.\nWe compare indications from relic density and direct detection experiments with\nconsistent LHC constraints, and asses the relative importance of the latter.\nOur analysis provides an interesting and well-motivated scenario to model MET\nat the LHC in terms of a handful of parameters.\n", "  We analyze the recently measured anomalous transport properties of an\nultracold gas through a ballistic constriction [S. Krinner et al., PNAS\n201601812 (2016)]. The quantized conductance observed at weak interactions\nincreases several-fold as the gas is made strongly interacting, which cannot be\nexplained by the Landauer theory of single-channel transport. We show that this\nphenomenon is due to the multichannel Andreev reflections at the edges of the\nconstriction, where the interaction and confinement result in a superconducting\nstate. Andreev processes convert atoms of otherwise reflecting channels into\nthe condensate propagating through the constriction, leading to a significant\nexcess conductance. Furthermore, we find the spin conductance being suppressed\nby superconductivity; the agreement with experiment provides an additional\nsupport for our model.\n", "  We have carried out $^{63,65}$Cu NMR spectra measurements in magnetic field\nup to about 45~T on single crystal of a multiferroic triangular antiferromagnet\nCuCrO$_2$. The measurements were performed for magnetic fields aligned along\nthe crystal $c$-axis. Field and temperature evolution of the spectral shape\ndemonstrates a number of phase transitions. It was found that the 3D magnetic\nordering takes place in the low field range ($H\\lesssim15$~T). At higher fields\nmagnetic structures form within individual triangular planes whereas the spin\ndirections of the magnetic ions from neighboring planes are not correlated. It\nis established that the 2D-3D transition is hysteretic in field and\ntemperature. Lineshape analysis reveals several possible magnetic structures\nexisting within individual planes for different phases of CuCrO$_2$. Within\ncertain regions on the magnetic H-T phase diagram of CuCrO$_2$ a 3D magnetic\nordering with tensor order parameter is expected.\n", "  We calculated the coupled channel photoproduction amplitudes of the scalar\nisovector resononace $a_0(980)$, which include the $\\pi\\eta$, $K^+K^-$ and\n$K^0\\overline{K^0}$ intermediate states. Based on them we obtained the mass\ndistribution in the $\\pi\\eta$ channel at photon energy $E_\\gamma$=7 GeV,\ncorresponding to energy accissible in new JLab experiments CLAS12 and GlueX. We\nalso analyzed the shape of mass distribution as a function of the phase of the\nbackground amplitude.\n", "  We introduce a paradigm for accurate design of metasurfaces for intricate\nbeam manipulation, implementing functionalities previously considered\nimpossible to achieve with passive lossless elements. The key concept involves\nself-generation of auxiliary evanescent fields which facilitate the required\nlocal power conservation, without interfering with the device performance in\nthe far field. We demonstrate our scheme by presenting exact reactive solutions\nto the challenging problems of reflectionless beam splitting and perfect\nreflection, verified via full wave simulations.\n", "  Hole spins have gained considerable interest in the past few years due to\ntheir potential for fast electrically controlled qubits. Here, we study holes\nconfined in Ge hut wires, a so far unexplored type of nanostructure. Low\ntemperature magnetotransport measurements reveal a large anisotropy between the\nin-plane and out-of-plane g-factors of up to 18. Numerical simulations verify\nthat this large anisotropy originates from a confined wave function which is of\nheavy hole character. A light hole admixture of less than 1% is estimated for\nthe states of lowest energy, leading to a surprisingly large reduction of the\nout-of-plane g-factors. However, this tiny light hole contribution does not\ninfluence the spin lifetimes, which are expected to be very long, even in non\nisotopically purified samples.\n", "  The growth constant for two-dimensional self-avoiding walks on the honeycomb\nlattice was conjectured by Nienhuis in 1982, and since that time the\ncorresponding results for the square and triangular lattices have been sought.\nFor the square lattice, a possible conjecture was advanced by one of us (AJG)\nmore than 20 years ago, based on the six significant digit estimate available\nat the time. This estimate has improved by a further six digits over the\nintervening decades, and the conjectured value continued to agree with the\nincreasingly precise estimates. We discuss the three most successful methods\nfor estimating the growth constant, including the most recently developed\nTopological Transfer-Matrix method, due to another of us (JLJ). We show this to\nbe the most computationally efficient of the three methods, and by\nparallelising the algorithm we have estimated the growth constant significantly\nmore precisely, incidentally ruling out the conjecture, which fails in the 12th\ndigit. Our new estimate of the growth constant is $$\\mu(\\mathrm{square}) =\n2.63815853032790\\, (3).$$\n", "  We desire a simple comparison of the absolute effective areas of the current\ngeneration of CCD instruments onboard the following observatories: Chandra\nACIS-S3, XMM-Newton (EPIC-MOS and EPIC-pn), Suzaku XIS, and Swift XRT and a\nstraightforward comparison of the time-dependent response of these instruments\nacross their respective mission lifetimes. We have been using 1E 0102.2-7219,\nthe brightest supernova remnant in the Small Magellanic Cloud, to evaluate and\nmodify the response models of these instruments. 1E 0102.2-7219 has strong\nlines of O, Ne, and Mg below 1.5 keV and little or no Fe emission to complicate\nthe spectrum. As part of the activities of the International Astronomical\nConsortium for High Energy Calibration (IACHEC), we have developed a standard\nspectral model for 1E 0102.2-7219. The model is empirical in that it includes\nGaussians for the identified lines, an absorption component in the Galaxy,\nanother absorption component in the SMC, and two thermal continuum components.\nIn our fits, the model is highly constrained in that only the normalizations of\nthe four brightest lines/line complexes (the O vii He$\\alpha$ triplet, O viii\nLy$\\alpha$ line, the Ne ix He$\\alpha$ triplet, and the Ne x Ly$\\alpha$ line)\nand an overall normalization are allowed to vary. We have examined these\nmeasured line fluxes as a function of time for each instrument after applying\nthe most recent calibrations that account for the time-dependent response of\neach instrument. We perform our effective area comparison with representative,\nearly mission data when the radiation damage and contamination layers were at a\nminimum. We find that the measured fluxes of these lines generally agree to\nwithin +/-10% for all instruments, with 38 of our 48 fitted normalizations\nwithin +/-10% of the IACHEC model value.\n", "  The two most commonly used models for passively modelocked lasers with fast\nsaturable absorbers are the Haus modelocking equation (HME) and the\ncubic-quintic modelocking equation (CQME). The HME corresponds to a special\nlimit of the CQME in which only a cubic nonlinearity in the fast saturable\nabsorber is kept in the model. Here, we use singular perturbation theory to\ndemonstrate that the CQME has a stable high-energy solution for an arbitrarily\nsmall but non-zero quintic contribution to the fast saturable absorber. As a\nconsequence, we find that the CQME predicts the existence of stable modelocked\npulses when the cubic nonlinearity is orders of magnitude larger than the value\nat which the HME predicts that modelocked pulses become unstable. This\nintrinsically larger stability range is consistent with experiments. Our\nresults suggest a possible path to obtain high-energy and ultrashort pulses by\nfine tuning the higher-order nonlinear terms in the fast saturable absorber.\n", "  We report the discovery of a microlensing planet OGLE-2012-BLG-0950Lb with\nthe planet/host mass ratio of $q \\sim 2 \\times 10^{-4}$. A long term distortion\ndetected in both MOA and OGLE light curve can be explained by the microlens\nparallax due to the Earth's orbital motion around the Sun. Although the finite\nsource effect is not detected, we obtain the lens flux by the high resolution\nKeck AO observation. Combining the microlens parallax and the lens flux reveal\nthe nature of the lens: a planet with mass of $M_{\\rm p} = 35^{+17}_{-9}\nM_{\\oplus}$ is orbiting around a M-dwarf with mass of $M_{\\rm host} =\n0.56^{+0.12}_{-0.16} M_{\\odot}$ with a planet-host projected separation of\n$r_{\\perp} =2.7^{+0.6}_{-0.7}$ AU located at $D_{\\rm L} = 3.0^{+0.8}_{-1.1}$\nkpc from us. This is the first mass measurement from only microlens parallax\nand the lens flux without the finite source effect. In the coming space\nobservation-era with $Spitzer$, $K2$, $Euclid$, and $WFIRST$, we expect many\nsuch events for which we will not be able to measure any finite source effect.\nThis work demonstrates an ability of mass measurements in such events.\n", "  PtBi2 with a layered trigonal crystal structure was recently reported to\nexhibit an unconventional large linear magnetoresistance, while the mechanism\ninvolved is still elusive. Using high resolution angle-resolved photoemission\nspectroscopy, we present a systematic study on its bulk and surface electronic\nstructure. Through careful comparison with first-principle calculations, our\nexperiment distinguishes the low-lying bulk bands from entangled surface\nstates, allowing the estimation of the real stoichiometry of samples. We find\nsignificant electron doping in PtBi2, implying a substantial Bi deficiency\ninduced disorder therein. We discover a Dirac-cone-like surface state on the\nboundary of the Brillouin zone, which is identified as an accidental Dirac band\nwithout topological protection. Our findings exclude quantum-limit-induced\nlinear band dispersion as the cause of the unconventional large linear\nmagnetoresistance.\n", "  Frequency-dependent correlations, such as the spectral function and the\ndynamical structure factor, help understand condensed matter experiments.\nWithin the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) framework, an accurate\nmethod for calculating spectral functions directly in frequency is the\ncorrection-vector method. The correction-vector can be computed by solving a\nlinear equation or by minimizing a functional. This paper proposes an\nalternative to calculate the correction vector: to use the Krylov-space\napproach. This paper then studies the accuracy and performance of the\nKrylov-space approach, when applied to the Heisenberg, the t-J, and the Hubbard\nmodels. The cases studied indicate that Krylov-space approach can be more\naccurate and efficient than conjugate gradient, and that the error of the\nformer integrates best when a Krylov-space decomposition is also used for\nground state DMRG.\n", "  Statistical properties of infinite products of random isotropically\ndistributed matrices are investigated. Both for continuous processes with\nfinite correlation time and discrete sequences of independent matrices, a\nformalism that allows to calculate easily the Lyapunov spectrum and generalized\nLyapunov exponents is developed. This problem is of interest to probability\ntheory, statistical characteristics of matrix T-exponentials are also needed\nfor turbulent transport problems, dynamical chaos and other parts of\nstatistical physics.\n", "  We present $Spitzer$/IRS mid-infrared spectral maps of the Galactic\nstar-forming region M17 as well as IRSF/SIRIUS Br$\\gamma$ and Nobeyama\n45-m/FOREST $^{13}$CO ($J$=1--0) maps. The spectra show prominent features due\nto polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) at wavelengths of 6.2, 7.7, 8.6,\n11.3, 12.0, 12.7, 13.5, and 14.2 $\\mu$m. We find that the PAH emission features\nare bright in the region between the HII region traced by Br$\\gamma$ and the\nmolecular cloud traced by $^{13}$CO, supporting that the PAH emission\noriginates mostly from photo-dissociation regions. Based on the\nspatially-resolved $Spitzer$/IRS maps, we examine spatial variations of the PAH\nproperties in detail. As a result, we find that the interband ratio of PAH 7.7\n$\\mu$m/PAH 11.3 $\\mu$m varies locally near M17SW, but rather independently of\nthe distance from the OB stars in M17, suggesting that the degree of PAH\nionization is mainly controlled by local conditions rather than the global UV\nenvironments determined by the OB stars in M17. We also find that the interband\nratios of the PAH 12.0 $\\mu$m, 12.7 $\\mu$m, 13.5 $\\mu$m, and 14.2 $\\mu$m\nfeatures to the PAH 11.3 $\\mu$m feature are high near the M17 center, which\nsuggests structural changes of PAHs through processing due to intense UV\nradiation, producing abundant edgy irregular PAHs near the M17 center.\n", "  This brief review presents the emerging field of mesoscopic physics with cold\natoms, with an emphasis on thermal and 'thermoelectric' transport, i.e. coupled\ntransport of particle and entropy. We review in particular the comparison\nbetween theoretically predited and experimentally observed thermoelectric\neffects in such systems. We also show how combining well designed transport\nproperties and evaporative cooling leads to an equivalent of the Peltier effect\nwith cold atoms, which can be used as a new cooling procedure with improved\ncooling power and efficiency compared to the evaporative cooling currently used\nin atomic gases. This could lead to a new generation of experiments probing\nstrong correlation effects of ultracold fermionic atoms at low temperatures.\n", "  Dusty star-forming galaxies are among the most prodigious systems at high\nredshift (z>1), characterized by high star formation rates and huge dust\nreservoirs. The bright end of this population has been well characterized in\nrecent years, but considerable uncertainties remain for fainter dusty\nstar-forming galaxies, which are responsible for the bulk of star formation at\nhigh redshift and thus play a key role in galaxy growth and evolution.\n  In this first paper of our series, we describe our methods for finding high\nredshift faint dusty galaxies using millimeter observations with ALMA. We\nobtained ALMA 1.1 mm mosaic images for three strong-lensing galaxy clusters\nfrom the Frontier Fields survey. The 2'x2' mosaics overlap with the deep HST\nWFC3/IR footprints and encompass the high magnification regions of each\ncluster. The combination of extremely high ALMA sensitivity and the\nmagnification power of these clusters allows us to systematically probe the\nsub-mJy population of dusty star-forming galaxies over a large surveyed area.\n  We present a description of the reduction and analysis of the ALMA continuum\nobservations for the galaxy clusters Abell 2744 (z=0.308), MACSJ0416.1-2403\n(z=0.396) and MACSJ1149.5+2223 (z=0.543), for which we reach observed rms\nsensitivities of 55, 59 and 71 $\\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$ respectively. We detect 12\ndusty star-forming galaxies at S/N>5.0 across the three clusters, all of them\npresenting coincidence with NIR detected counterparts in the HST images. None\nof the sources fall close to the lensing caustics, thus they are not strongly\nlensed. The observed 1.1 mm flux densities for the total sample of galaxies\nrange from 0.41 to 2.82 mJy, with observed effective radii spanning <0.05\" to\n0.37\"$\\pm$0.21\". The lensing-corrected sizes of the detected sources appear to\nbe in the same range as those measured in brighter samples, albeit with\npossibly larger dispersion.\n", "  The results summarized here are intended as rigorous mathematical statements\non various physical models coming from condensed matter physics, statistical\nmechanics (classical and quantum), quantum field theory and cold atoms physics.\nThe main tools are mostly those of the mathematical analyst: partial\ndifferential equations, functional analysis, spectral theory, calculus of\nvariations, with some incursions into probability theory. A running thread is\nthe construction, by rigorous asymptotic analysis most of the time, of bridges\nbetween different levels of mathematical modeling of physical phenomena.\n  This is the manuscript for the author's habilitation thesis, summarizing\nresults obtained between 2011 and 2016, in collaboration with: Michele\nCorreggi, Mathieu Lewin, Douglas Lundholm, Phan Th\\`anh Nam, Robert Seiringer,\nSylvia Serfaty and Jakob Yngvason.\n", "  We present two-dimensional kinetic simulations, with a broad range of initial\nguide fields, that isolate the role of parallel electric fields ($E_\\parallel$)\nin energetic electron production during collisionless magnetic reconnection. In\nthe strong guide field regime, $E_\\parallel$ drives essentially all of the\nelectron energy gain, yet fails to generate an energetic component. We suggest\nthat this is due to the weak energy scaling of particle acceleration from\n$E_\\parallel$ compared to that of a Fermi-type mechanism responsible for\nenergetic electron production in the weak guide-field regime. This result has\nimportant implications for energetic electron production in astrophysical\nsystems and reconnection-driven dissipation in turbulence.\n", "  We studied the hydrogen atom as a system of two quantum particles in\ndifferent confinement conditions; a spherical-impenetrable-wall cavity and a\nfullerene molecule cage. The motion is referred to the center of spherical\ncavities, and the Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation solved by means of a Generalized\nSturmian Function expansion in spherical coordinates. The solutions present\ndifferent properties from the ones described by the many models in the\nliterature, where the proton is fixed in space and only the electron is\nconsidered as a quantum particle. Our results show that the position of the\nproton (i.e. the center of mas of the H atom) is very sensitive to the\nconfinement condition, and could vary substantially from one state to another,\nfrom being sharply centered to being localized outside the fullerene molecule.\nInterchange of the localization characteristics between the states when varying\nthe strength of the fullerene cage and mass occurred through crossing\nphenomena.\n", "  The Ba\\~{n}ados, Teitelboim and Zanelli \\cite{BTZ1992}, black hole solution\nis revamped from the Einstein field equations in (2 + 1)-dimensional anti-de\nSitter spacetime, in a context of noncommutative geometry \\cite{Rahaman(2013)}.\nIn this article, we explore the exact gravastar solutions in three-dimension\nanti-de Sitter space given in the same geometry. As a first step we derive BTZ\nsolution assuming the source of energy density as point-like structures in\nfavor of smeared objects, where the particle mass M, is diffused throughout a\nregion of linear size $\\sqrt{\\alpha}$ and is described by a Gaussian function\nof finite width rather than a Dirac delta function. We matched our interior\nsolution to an exterior BTZ spacetime at a junction interface situated outside\nthe event horizon. Furthermore, stability analysis is carried out for the\ndynamic case for the specific case when $\\chi < 0. 214$ under radial\nperturbations about static equilibrium solutions. To give theoretical support\nwe also trying to explore their physical properties and characteristics.\n", "  We present a catalogue of nearly 3,000 submillimetre sources detected at\n850um over ~5 square degrees surveyed as part of the James Clerk Maxwell\nTelescope (JCMT) SCUBA-2 Cosmology Legacy Survey (S2CLS). This is the largest\nsurvey of its kind at 850um, probing a meaningful cosmic volume at the peak of\nstar formation activity and increasing the sample size of submillimetre\ngalaxies selected at 850um by an order of magnitude. We describe the wide 850um\nsurvey component of S2CLS, which covers the key extragalactic survey fields:\nUKIDSS-UDS, COSMOS, Akari-NEP, Extended Groth Strip, Lockman Hole North, SSA22\nand GOODS-North. The average 1-sigma depth of S2CLS is 1.2 mJy/beam,\napproaching the SCUBA-2 850um confusion limit, which we determine to be ~0.8\nmJy/beam. We measure the single dish 850um number counts to unprecedented\naccuracy, reducing the Poisson errors on the differential counts to\napproximately 4% at S_850~3mJy. With several independent fields, we investigate\nfield-to-field variance, finding that the number counts on 0.5-1 degree scales\nare generally within 50% of the S2CLS mean for S_850>3mJy, with scatter\nconsistent with the Poisson and estimated cosmic variance uncertainties,\nalthough there is a marginal (2-sigma) density enhancement in the GOODS-North\nfield. The observed number counts are in reasonable agreement with recent\nphenomenological and semi-analytic models. Finally, the large solid angle of\nS2CLS allows us to measure the bright-end counts: at S_850>10mJy there are\napproximately ten sources per square degree, and we detect the distinctive\nup-turn in the number counts indicative of the detection of local sources of\n850um emission and strongly lensed high-redshift galaxies. Here we describe the\ndata collection and reduction procedures and present calibrated maps and a\ncatalogue of sources; these are made publicly available.\n", "  Using Quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we study a series of models of\nfermions coupled to quantum Ising spins on a square lattice with $N$ flavors of\nfermions per site for $N=1,2$ and $3$. The models have an extensive number of\nconserved quantities but are not integrable, and have rather rich phase\ndiagrams consisting of several exotic phases and phase transitions that lie\nbeyond Landau-Ginzburg paradigm. In particular, one of the prominent phase for\n$N>1$ corresponds to $2N$ gapless Dirac fermions coupled to an emergent\n$\\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge field in its deconfined phase. However, unlike a\nconventional $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory, we do not impose the `Gauss's Law' by\nhand and instead, it emerges due to spontaneous symmetry breaking.\nCorrespondingly, unlike a conventional $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory in two\nspatial dimensions, our models have a finite temperature phase transition\nassociated with the melting of the order parameter that dynamically imposes the\nGauss's law constraint at zero temperature. By tuning a parameter, the\ndeconfined phase undergoes a transition into a short range entangled phase,\nwhich corresponds to N\\'eel/Superconductor for $N=2$ and a Valence Bond Solid\nfor $N=3$. Furthermore, for $N=3$, the Valence Bond Solid further undergoes a\ntransition to a N\\'eel phase consistent with the deconfined quantum critical\nphenomenon studied earlier in the context of quantum magnets.\n", "  In this work, we study the acoustically mediated interaction forces among\nmultiple well-separated spherical particles trapped in the same node or\nantinode plane of a standing wave. An analytical expression of the acoustic\ninteraction force is derived, which is accurate even for the particles beyond\nthe Rayleigh limit. Interestingly, the multi-particle system can be decomposed\ninto a series of independent two-particle systems described by pairwise\ninteractions. Each pairwise interaction is a long-range interaction, as\ncharacterized by a soft oscillatory attenuation (at the power exponent of n=-1\nor -2). The vector additivity of the acoustic interaction force, which is not\nwell expected considering the nonlinear nature of the acoustic radiation force,\nis greatly useful for exploring a system consisting of a large number of\nparticles. The capability of self-organizing a big particle cluster can be\nanticipated through such acoustically controllable long-range interaction.\n", "  The influence of near-wall density and viscosity gradients on near-wall\nturbulence in a channel are studied by means of Direct Numerical Simulation\n(DNS) of the low-Mach number approximation of the Navier--Stokes equations.\nDifferent constitutive relations for density and viscosity as a function of\ntemperature are used in order to mimic a wide range of fluid behaviours and to\ndevelop a generalised framework for studying turbulence modulations in variable\nproperty flows. Instead of scaling the velocity solely based on local density,\nas done for the van Driest transformation, we derive an extension of the\nscaling that is based on gradients of the semi-local Reynolds number\n$Re_\\tau^*$. This extension of the van Driest transformation is able to\ncollapse velocity profiles for flows with near-wall property gradients as a\nfunction of the semi-local wall coordinate. However, flow quantities like\nmixing length, turbulence anisotropy and turbulent vorticity fluctuations do\nnot show a universal scaling very close to the wall. This is attributed to\nturbulence modulations, which play a crucial role on the evolution of turbulent\nstructures and turbulence energy transfer. We therefore investigate the\ncharacteristics of streamwise velocity streaks and quasi-streamwise vortices\nand found that, similar to turbulent statistics, the turbulent structures are\nalso strongly governed by $Re_\\tau^*$ profiles and that their dependence on\nindividual density and viscosity profiles is minor. Flows with near-wall\ngradients in $Re_\\tau^*$ ($d {Re_\\tau^*}/dy \\neq 0$) showed significant changes\nin the inclination and tilting angles of quasi-streamwise vortices. These\nstructural changes are responsible for the observed modulation of the Reynolds\nstress generation mechanism and the inter-component energy transfer in flows\nwith strong near-wall $Re_\\tau^*$ gradients.\n", "  A Gibbs operator $e^{-\\beta H}$ for a 2D lattice system with a Hamiltonian\n$H$ can be represented by a 3D tensor network, the third dimension being the\nimaginary time (inverse temperature) $\\beta$. Coarse-graining the network along\n$\\beta$ results in an accurate 2D projected entangled-pair operator (PEPO) with\na finite bond dimension. The coarse-graining is performed by a tree tensor\nnetwork of isometries that are optimized variationally to maximize the accuracy\nof the PEPO. The algorithm is applied to the two-dimensional Hubbard model on\nan infinite square lattice. Benchmark results are obtained that are consistent\nwith the best cluster dynamical mean-field theory and power series expansion in\nthe regime of parameters where they yield mutually consistent results.\n", "  In this paper we achieve the quantization of a particle moving on the $SU(2)$\ngroup manifold, that is, the three-dimensional sphere $S^{3}$, by using\ngroup-theoretical methods. For this purpose, a fundamental role is played by\ncontact, non-point symmetries, i.e., symmetries that leave the\nPoincar\\'e-Cartan form semi-invariant at the classical level, although not\nnecessarily the Lagrangian. Special attention is paid to the role played by the\nbasic quantum commutators, which depart from the canonical, Heisenberg-Weyl\nones, as well as the relationship between the integration measure in the\nHilbert space of the system and the non-trivial topology of the configuration\nspace. Also, the quantization on momentum space is briefly outlined.\n", "  Using the process of cavity-enhanced spontaneous parametric down-conversion\n(SPDC), we generate a narrow-band polarization-entangled photon pair resonant\non the rubidium (Rb) D1 line (795 nm). The degenerate single-mode photon pair\nis selected by multiple temperature controlled etalons. The linewidth of\ngenerated polarization-entangled photon pairs is 15 MHz which matches the\ntypical atomic memory bandwidth. The measured Bell parameter for the\npolarization-entangled photons S=2.73+-0.04 which violates the Bell-CHSH\ninequality by ~18 standard deviations. The presented entangled photon pair\nsource could be utilized in quantum communication and quantum computing based\non quantum memories in atomic ensemble.\n", "  We study the class of non-holonomic power series with integer coefficients\nthat reduce, modulo primes, or powers of primes, to algebraic functions. In\nparticular we try to determine whether the susceptibility of the square-lattice\nIsing model belongs to this class, and more broadly whether the susceptibility\nis a solution of a differentially algebraic equation. Initial results on\nTutte's non-linear ordinary differential equation (ODE) and other simple\nquadratic non-linear ODEs suggest that a large set of differentially algebraic\npower series solutions with integer coefficients might reduce to algebraic\nfunctions modulo primes, or powers of primes. Here we give several examples of\nseries with integer coefficients and non-zero radius of convergence that reduce\nto algebraic functions modulo (almost) every prime (or power of a prime). These\nexamples satisfy differentially algebraic equations with the encoding\npolynomial occasionally possessing quite high degree (and thus difficult to\nidentify even with long series). Additionally, we have extended both the high-\nand low-temperature Ising square-lattice susceptibility series to 5043\ncoefficients. We find that even this long series is insufficient to determine\nwhether it reduces to algebraic functions modulo $3$, $5$, etc. This negative\nresult is in contrast to the comparatively easy confirmation that the\ncorresponding series reduce to algebraic functions modulo powers of $2$.\n", "  The fusion dynamic mechanism of heavy-ions at energies near the Coulomb\nbarrier is complicated and still not very clear up to now. Accordingly, a\nself-consistent method based on the CCFULL calculations has been developed and\napplied for an ingoing study of the effect of the positive Q-value neutron\ntransfer (PQNT) channels in this work. The typical experimental fusion data of\nCa + Ca and Ni + Ni is analyzed within the unified calculation scheme. The PQNT\neffect in near-barrier fusion is further confirmed based on the self-consistent\nanalysis and extracted quantitatively.\n", "  We present the {\\tt Mathematica} package {\\tt TopoID} which aims at the\nautomation of several steps in multiloop calculations. The algorithm which lies\nat the very core of the package is described and illustrated with an example.\nThe main features of {\\tt TopoID} are stated and some of them are briefly\ndemonstrated for NLO or NNLO Higgs boson production.\n", "  Complex structures on a material surface can significantly reduce total\nsecondary electron emission from that surface. A velvet is a surface that\nconsists of an array of vertically standing whiskers. The reduction occurs due\nto the capture of low-energy, true secondary electrons emitted at the bottom of\nthe structure and on the sides of the velvet whiskers. We performed numerical\nsimulations and developed an approximate analytical model that calculates the\nnet secondary electron emission yield from a velvet surface as a function of\nthe velvet whisker length and packing density, and the angle of incidence of\nprimary electrons. We found that to suppress secondary electrons, the following\ncondition on dimensionless parameters must be met: {\\pi}/2 DA tan {\\theta} >> 1\nwhere {\\theta} is the angle of incidence of the primary electron from the\nnormal, D is the fraction of surface area taken up by the velvet whisker bases,\nand A is the aspect ratio, A {\\equiv} h/r, the ratio of height to radius of the\nvelvet whiskers. We find that velvets available today can reduce the secondary\nelectron yield by 90% from the value of a flat surface. The values of optimal\nvelvet whisker packing density that maximally suppresses secondary electron\nemission yield are determined as a function of velvet aspect ratio and electron\nangle of incidence.\n", "  This paper brings out results of a measurement campaign aiming to determine\nthe temperature coefficients of synthetic quartz elastic constants at liquid\nhelium temperature. The method is based on the relationship between the\nresonance frequencies of a quartz acoustic cavity and the elastic constants of\nthe material. The temperature coefficients of the elastic constants are\nextracted from experimental frequency-temperature data collected from a set of\nresonators of various cut angles, because of the anisotropy of quartz, measured\non the very useful cryogenic range [4 K - 15 K]. The knowledge of these\ntemperature coefficients would allow to further design either quartz\ntemperature sensors or conversely frequency-temperature compensated quartz\ncuts. With extremely low losses, lower than $10^{-9}$ for the best ones, key\napplications of such devices are ultra-low loss mechanical systems used in many\nresearch areas including frequency control and fundamental measurements. The\nEulerian formalism is used in this study to identify the temperature\ncoefficients.\n", "  We report our spectroscopic studies of the $d \\ ^3\\Pi$ state of ultra-cold\n$^7$Li$^{85}$Rb using resonantly-enhanced multi-photon ionization and depletion\nspectroscopy with bound-to-bound transitions originating from the metastable $a\n\\ ^3\\Sigma^+$ state. We evaluate the potential of this state for use as the\nintermediate state in a STIRAP transfer scheme from triplet Feshbach LiRb\nmolecules to the $X \\ ^1\\Sigma^+$ ground state, and find that the lowest\nseveral vibrational levels possess the requisite overlap with initial and final\nstates, as well as convenient energies. Using depletion measurements, we\nmeasured the well depth and spin-orbit splitting. We suggest possible pathways\nfor short-range photoassociation using deeply-bound vibrational levels of this\nelectronic state.\n", "  Conversions between spin and charge currents are core technologies in recent\nspintronics. In this article, we provide methods for estimating inverse spin\nHall effects (ISHEs) induced by using microwave-driven spin pumping (SP) as a\nspin-current generator. ISHE and SP induce an electromotive force at the\nferromagnetic or spin-wave resonance, which offers a valuable electric way to\nstudy spin physics in materials. At the resonance, a microwave for exciting the\nmagnetization dynamics induces an additional electromotive force via rf-current\nrectification and thermoelectric effects. We discuss methods to separate the\nsignals generated from such extrinsic microwave effects by controlling sample\nstructures and configurations. These methods are helpful in performing accurate\nmeasurements on ISHE induced by SP, enabling quantitative studies on the\nconversion between spin and charge currents on various kinds of materials.\n", "  Electromagnetic field quantization in the presence of two semi-infinite\ndielectrics with moving interface is investigated in $1+1$-dimensional\nspace-time. The moving interface is modeled for small displacements and the\nfield equation is solved perturbatively. Input-output relations and spectral\ndistribution of emitted photons are obtained and the effect of small\ntransitions trough the interface discussed.\n", "  The D2O ice VI to ice XV hydrogen ordering phase transition at ambient\npressure is investigated in detail with neutron diffraction. The lattice\nconstants are found to be sensitive indicators for hydrogen ordering. The a and\nb lattice constants contract whereas a pronounced expansion in c is found upon\nhydrogen ordering. Overall, the hydrogen ordering transition goes along with a\nsmall increase in volume which explains why the phase transition is more\ndifficult to observe upon cooling under pressure. Slow-cooling ice VI at 1.4\nGPa gives essentially fully hydrogen-disordered ice VI. Consistent with earlier\nstudies, the ice XV obtained after slow-cooling at ambient pressure is best\ndescribed with P-1 space group symmetry. Using a new computational approach, we\nachieve the atomistic reconstruction of a supercell structure that is\nconsistent with the average partially ordered structure derived from Rietveld\nrefinements. This shows that C-type networks are most prevalent in ice XV but\nother structural motifs outside of the classifications of the fully\nhydrogen-ordered networks are identified as well. The recently proposed Pmmn\nstructural model for ice XV is found to be incompatible with our diffraction\ndata and we argue that only structural models that are capable of describing\nfull hydrogen order should be used.\n", "  By employing the full counting statistics formalism, we characterize the\nfirst moment of energy that is exchanged during a generally non-Markovian\nevolution in non-driven continuous variables systems. In particular, we focus\non the evaluation of the energy flowing back from the environment into the open\nquantum system. We apply these results to the quantum Brownian motion, where\nthese quantities are calculated both analytically, under the weak coupling\nassumption, and numerically also in the strong coupling regime. Finally, we\ncharacterize the non-Markovianity of the reduced dynamics through a recently\nintroduced witness based on the so-called Gaussian interferometric power and we\ndiscuss its relationship with the energy backflow measure.\n", "  We present quasi-analytical solutions (QANS) of hybrid platform (HP)\ncomprising metallic grating (MG) and stacked-dielectric layers for terahertz\n(THz) radiation. The QANS are validated by finite difference time domain\nsimulation. It is found that the Wood anomalies induce the high-order spoof\nsurface plasmon resonances in the HP. The QANS are applied to optimize new\nperfect absorber for THz sensing of large-area thin film with ultrahigh figure\nof merit reaching fifth order of magnitude for the film thickness 0.0001p (p:\nMG period). The first-order Wood's anomaly of the insulator layer and the\nFabry-Perot in the slit's cavity account for the resonance of the perfect\nabsorber. The QANS and the new perfect absorber may lead to highly sensitive\nand practical nano-film refractive index sensor for THz radiation.\n", "  We show that, when $N$ is a multiple of 6 ($N=6m$, $m$ integer), the \\SU{N}\nHeisenberg model on the honeycomb lattice with $m$ particles per site has a\nclear tendency toward chiral order as soon as $m\\geq 2$. This conclusion has\nbeen reached by a systematic variational Monte Carlo investigation of\nGutzwiller projected wave-functions as a function of $m$ between the case of\none particle per site ($m=1$), for which the ground state has recently been\nshown to be in a plaquette singlet state, and the $m\\rightarrow \\infty$ limit,\nwhere a mean-field approach has established that the ground state has chiral\norder. This demonstrates that the chiral phase can indeed be stabilized for not\ntoo large values of $m$, opening the way to its experimental realisations in\nother lattices.\n", "  We use scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) to study magnetic Fe impurities\nintentionally doped into the high-temperature superconductor\nBi$_{2}$Sr$_{2}$Ca$_{2}$CuO$_{8+\\delta}$. Our spectroscopic measurements reveal\nthat Fe impurities introduce low-lying resonances in the density of states at\n\\Omega$_{1}$ $\\approx$ 4meV and \\Omega$_{2}$ $\\approx$ 15 meV allowing us to\ndetermine that, despite having a large magnetic moment, potential scattering of\nquasiparticles by Fe impurities dominates magnetic scattering. In addition,\nusing high-resolution spatial characterizations of the local density of states\nnear and away from Fe impurities, we detail the spatial extent of impurity\naffected regions as well as provide a local view of impurity-induced effects on\nthe superconducting and pseudogap states. Our studies of Fe impurities, when\ncombined with a reinterpretation of earlier STM work in the context of a\ntwo-gap scenario, allow us to present a unified view of the atomic-scale\neffects of elemental impurities on the pseudogap and superconducting states in\nhole-doped cuprates; this may help resolve a previously assumed dichotomy\nbetween the effects of magnetic and non-magnetic impurities in these materials.\n", "  Motivated by a class of flux compactifications of type IIA strings on rigid\nCalabi-Yau manifolds, preserving N=2 local supersymmetry in four dimensions, we\nderive a non-perturbative potential of all scalar fields from the exact\nD-instanton corrected metric on the hypermultiplet moduli space. Applying this\npotential to moduli stabilization, we find a discrete set of exact vacua for\naxions. At these critical points, the stability problem is decoupled into two\nsubspaces spanned by the axions and the other fields (dilaton and Kahler\nmoduli), respectively. Whereas the stability of the axions is easily achieved,\nnumerical analysis shows instabilities in the second subspace.\n", "  Information plays a pivotal role in the thermodynamics of nonequilibrium\nprocesses with feedback. However, much remains to be learned about the nature\nof information fluctuations in small scale devices and their relation with\nfluctuations in other thermodynamics quantities, like heat and work. Here we\nderive a series of fluctuation theorems for information flow and partial\nentropy production in a Brownian particle model of feedback cooling and extend\nthem to arbitrary driven diffusion processes. We then analyze the long-time\nbehavior of the feedback-cooling model in detail. Our results provide insights\ninto the structure and origin of large deviations of information and\nthermodynamic quantities in autonomous Maxwell's demons.\n", "  We have studied extensively the band crossing patterns of the bulk\nentanglement spectrum (BES) for various lattice Chern insulators. We find that\nonly partitions with dual symmetry can have either stable nodal-lines or\nnodal-points in the BES when the system is in the topological phase of a\nnonzero Chern number. By deforming the Hamiltonian to lift the accidental\nsymmetry, one can see that only nodal points are robust. They thus should bear\ncertain topological characteristics of the BES. By studying the band crossing\npatterns in details we conclude that the topological characteristics of the BES\nare inherited from the topological order of the underlying Chern insulators and\nthe former can have more refined topological structures. We then propose the\nconjecture that the sum of the vorticities in the BES in a properly chosen\nreduced Brillouin zone equals the Chern number of the underlying Chern\ninsulator. This relation is beyond the usual classification scheme of\ntopological insulators/superconductors.\n", "  Detector-device-independent quantum key distribution (ddiQKD) held the\npromise of being robust to detector side-channels, a major security loophole in\nQKD implementations. In contrast to what has been claimed, however, we\ndemonstrate that the security of ddiQKD is not based on post-selected\nentanglement, and we introduce various eavesdropping strategies that show that\nddiQKD is in fact insecure against detector side-channel attacks as well as\nagainst other attacks that exploit device's imperfections of the receiver. Our\nattacks are valid even when the QKD apparatuses are built by the legitimate\nusers of the system themselves, and thus free of malicious modifications, which\nis a key assumption in ddiQKD.\n", "  We argue that extra dimensions with a properly chosen compactification scheme\ncould be a natural source for emergent gauge symmetries. Actually, some\nproposed vector field potential terms or polynomial vector field constraints\nintroduced in five-dimensional Abelian and non-Abelian gauge theory is shown to\nsmoothly lead to spontaneous violation of an underlying 5D spacetime symmetry\nand generate pseudo-Goldstone vector modes as conventional 4D gauge boson\ncandidates. As a special signature, there appear, apart from conventional gauge\ncouplings, some properly suppressed direct multi-photon (multi-boson, in\ngeneral) interactions in emergent QED and Yang-Mills theories whose observation\ncould shed light on their high-dimensional nature. Moreover, in emergent\nYang-Mills theories an internal symmetry G also occurs spontaneously broken to\nits diagonal subgroups once 5D Lorentz violation happens. This breaking origins\nfrom the extra vector field components playing a role of some adjoint scalar\nfield multiplet in the 4D spacetime. So, one naturally has the Higgs effect\nwithout a specially introduced scalar field multiplet. Remarkably, when being\napplied to Grand Unified Theories this results in a fact that the emergent GUTs\ngenerically appear broken down to the Standard Model just at the 5D Lorentz\nviolation scale M.\n  PACS numbers: 11.15.-q, 11.30.Cp, 11.30.Pb, 11.10.Kk\n", "  We study the interaction effects on thin films of topological mirror Kondo\ninsulators (TMKI), where the strong interaction is expected to play an\nimportant role. Our study has led to the following results: (1) We identify a\nrich phase diagram of non-interacting TMKI with different mirror Chern numbers\nin the monolayer and bilayer thin films; (2) We obtain the phase diagram with\ninteraction and identify the regimes of interaction parameters to mimic bosonic\nsymmetry protected topological phases with either gapless bosonic modes or\nspontaneous mirror symmetry breaking at the boundary; (3) For the spontaneous\nmirror symmetry breaking boundary, we also study various domain-wall defects\nbetween different mirror symmetry breaking order parameters at the boundary.\nOur results reveal that the thin film TMKI serves as an intriguing platform for\nthe experimental studies of interacting topological phases.\n", "  We analyze the SDSS DR12 quasar catalogue to test the large-scale smoothness\nin the quasar distribution. We quantify the degree of inhomogeneity in the\nquasar distribution using information theory based measures and find that the\ndegree of inhomogeneity diminishes with increasing length scales which finally\nreach a plateau at $\\sim 250 \\, h^{-1}\\, {\\rm Mpc}$. The residual inhomogeneity\nat the plateau is consistent with that expected for a Poisson point process.\nOur results indicate that the quasar distribution is homogeneous beyond length\nscales of $250 \\, h^{-1}\\, {\\rm Mpc}$.\n", "  LAM and CEA-LETI are developing the technology of deformable detectors, for\nUV, VIS or NIR applications. Such breakthrough devices will be a revolution for\nfuture wide field imagers and spectrographs, firstly by improving the image\nquality with better off-axis sharpness, resolution, brightness while scaling\ndown the optical system, secondly by overcoming the manufacturing issues\nidentified so far and by offering a flexibility and versatility in optical\ndesign. The technology of curved detectors can benefit of the developments of\nactive and deformable structures, to provide a flexibility and a fine tuning of\nthe detectors curvature by thinning down the substrate without modifying the\nfabrication process of the active pixels. We present studies done so far on\noptical design improvements, the technological demonstrators we developed and\ntheir performances as well as the future five-years roadmap for these\ndevelopments.\n", "  We study the ground state conduction properties of noninteracting electrons\nin aperiodic but non-random one-dimensional models with chiral symmetry, and\nmake comparisons against Anderson models with non-deterministic disorder. The\nfirst model we consider is the Fibonacci lattice, which is a paradigmatic model\nof quasicrystals; the second is the Riemann lattice, which we define inspired\nby Dyson's proposal on the possible connection between the Riemann hypothesis\nand a suitably defined quasicrystal. Our analysis is based on Kohn's\nmany-particle localization tensor defined within the modern theory of the\ninsulating state. In the Fibonacci quasicrystal, where all single-particle\neigenstates are critical (i.e., intermediate between ergodic and localized),\nthe noninteracting electron gas is found to be a conductor at most electron\ndensities, including the half-filled case; however, at various specific\nfillings $\\rho$, including the values $\\rho = 1/g^n$, where $g$ is the golden\nratio and $n$ is any integer, the gas turns into an insulator due to spectral\ngaps. Metallic behaviour is found at half-filling in the Riemann lattice as\nwell; however, in contrast to the Fibonacci quasicrystal, the Riemann lattice\nis generically an insulator due to single-particle eigenstate localization,\nlikely at all other fillings. Its behaviour turns out to be alike that of the\noff-diagonal Anderson model, albeit with different system-size scaling of the\nband-centre anomalies. The advantages of analysing the Kohn's localization\ntensor instead of other measures of localization familiar from the theory of\nAnderson insulators (such as the participation ratio or the Lyapunov exponent)\nare highlighted.\n", "  We investigate, in the context of a real massless scalar field in $1+1$\ndimensions, models of partially reflecting mirrors simulated by Dirac\n$\\delta-\\delta^{\\prime}$ point interactions. In the literature, these models do\nnot exhibit full transparency at high frequencies. In order to provide a more\nrealistic feature for these models, we propose a modified\n$\\delta-\\delta^{\\prime}$ point interaction that enables full transparency in\nthe limit of high frequencies. Taking this modified $\\delta-\\delta^{\\prime}$\nmodel into account, we investigate the Casimir force, comparing our results\nwith those found in the literature.\n", "  Lipid structures exhibit complex and highly dynamic lateral structure; and\nchanges in lipid density and fluidity are believed to play an essential role in\nmembrane targeting and function. The dynamic structure of liquids on the\nmolecular scale can exhibit complex transient density fluctuations. Here the\nlateral heterogeneity of lipid dynamics is explored in free standing lipid\nmonolayers. As the temperature is lowered the probes exhibit increasingly broad\nand heterogeneous rotational correlation. This increase in heterogeneity\nappears to exhibit a critical onset, similar to those observed for glass\nforming fluids. We explore heterogeneous relaxation in in a single constituent\nlipid monolayer of 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DMPC) by\nmeasuring the rotational diffusion of a fluorescent probe,\n1-palmitoyl-2-[1]-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (NBD-PC), using wide-field\ntime-resolved fluorescence anisotropy (TRFA). The observed relaxation exhibits\na narrow, liquid-like distribution at high temperatures ({\\tau} ~ 2.4 ns),\nconsistent with previous experimental measures [1, 2]. However, as the\ntemperature is quenched, the distribution broadens, and we observe the\nappearance of a long relaxation population ({\\tau} ~ 16.5 ns). This supports\nthe heterogeneity observed for lipids at high packing densities, and\ndemonstrates that the nanoscale diffusion and reorganization in lipid\nstructures can be significantly complex, even in the simplest amorphous\narchitectures. Dynamical heterogeneity of this form can have a significant\nimpact on the organization, permeability and energetics of lipid membrane\nstructures.\n", "  We propose a new formalism to study the ABJM matrix model. Contrary to\nexpressing the fractional brane background with the Wilson loops in the open\nstring formalism, we formulate the Wilson loop expectation value from the\nviewpoint of the closed string background. With this new formalism, we can\nprove some duality relations in the matrix model.\n", "  In this note, we show that for a large class of nonlinear wave equations with\nodd nonlinearities, any globally defined odd solution which is small in the\nenergy space decays to $0$ in the local energy norm. In particular, this result\nshows nonexistence of small, odd breathers for some classical nonlinear Klein\nGordon equations such as the sine Gordon equation and $\\phi^4$ and $\\phi^6$\nmodels. It also partially answers a question of Soffer and Weinstein in\n\\cite[p. 19]{MR1681113} about nonexistence of breathers for the cubic NLKG in\ndimension one.\n", "  Certain phase transitions between topological quantum field theories (TQFT)\nare driven by the condensation of bosonic anyons. However, as bosons in a TQFT\nare themselves nontrivial collective excitations, there can be topological\nobstructions that prevent them from condensing. Here we formulate such an\nobstruction in the form of a no-go theorem. We use it to show that no\ncondensation is possible in SO(3)$_k$ TQFTs with odd $k$. We further show that\na layered theory obtained by tensoring SO(3)$_k$ TQFT with itself any integer\nnumber of times does not admit condensation transitions either. This includes\n(as the case $k=3$) the noncondensability of any number of layers of the\nFibonacci TQFT.\n", "  Numerical simulation of wave propagation in an infinite medium is made\npossible by surrounding a finite region by a perfectly matched layer (PML).\nUsing this approach a generalized three-dimensional (3D) formulation is\nproposed for time-domain modeling of elastic wave propagation in an unbounded\nlossless anisotropic medium. The formulation is based on a second-order\napproach that has the advantages of, physical relationship to the underlying\nequations, and amenability to be implemented in common numerical schemes.\nSpecifically, our formulation uses three second-order equations of the\ndisplacement field and nine auxiliary equations, along with the three time\nhistories of the displacement field. The properties of the PML, which are\ncontrolled by a complex two-parameter stretch function, are such that it acts\nas near perfect absorber. Using finite element method (FEM) 3D numerical\nresults are presented for a highly anisotropic medium. An extension of the\nformulation to the particular case of a Kelvin-Vogit viscoelastic medium is\nalso presented.\n", "  We propose the use of sparse grids to accelerate particle-in-cell (PIC)\nschemes. By using the so-called `combination technique' from the sparse grids\nliterature, we are able to dramatically increase the size of the spatial cells\nin multi-dimensional PIC schemes while paying only a slight penalty in\ngrid-based error. The resulting increase in cell size allows us to reduce the\nstatistical noise in the simulation without increasing total particle number.\nWe present initial proof-of-principle results from test cases in two and three\ndimensions that demonstrate the new scheme's efficiency, both in terms of\ncomputation time and memory usage.\n", "  We describe a procedure to tune the charged hadron multiplicities for deep\ninelastic events produced by the NEUT neutrino interaction generator. This\ntuning uses a model based on Koba-Nielsen-Olesen scaling, whose parameters are\nobtained by fitting multiplicity data from deuterium bubble chamber\nexperiments. After tuning, the multiplicities of the events generated by NEUT\nare found to be in good agreement with the measurements from the bubble chamber\nexperiments.\n", "  High-energy cosmic-ray electrons reveal some remarkable spectral features,\nthe most noteworthy of which is the rise in the positron fraction above 10~GeV.\nDue to strong energy loss during propagation, these particles can reach Earth\nonly from nearby sources. Yet, the exact nature of these sources, which most\nlikely manifest themselves in the observed anomalies, remains elusive. The many\nexplanations put forward to resolve this case range from standard astrophysics\nto exotic physics. In this paper, we discuss the possible astrophysical origin\nof high-energy cosmic-ray electrons through a fully three-dimensional\ntime-dependent Monte Carlo simulation. This approach, which takes advantage of\nthe intrinsic random nature of cosmic-ray diffusive propagation, provides\nvaluable information on the electron-by-electron fluctuations, making it\nparticularly suitable for analyzing in depth the single-source scenario.\n", "  The properties of the number of iterations in random sequential adsorption\nprotocol needed to generate finite saturated random packing of spherically\nsymmetric shapes were studied. Numerical results obtained for one, two, and\nthree dimensional packings were supported by analytical calculations valid for\nany dimension $d$. It has been shown that the number of iterations needed to\ngenerate finite saturated packing is subject to Pareto distribution with\nexponent $-1-1/d$ and the median of this distribution scales with packing size\naccording to the power-law characterized by exponent $d$. Obtained resultscan\nbe used in designing effective RSA simulations.\n", "  The standard analytic solution of the renormalization group (RG) evolution\nfor the $\\Delta S = 1$ Wilson coefficients involves several singularities,\nwhich complicate analytic solutions. In this paper we derive a singularity-free\nsolution of the next-to-leading order (NLO) RG equations, which greatly\nfacilitates the calculation of $\\epsilon_K^{\\prime}$, the measure of direct\n$CP$ violation in $K\\to \\pi\\pi$ decays. Using our new RG evolution and the\nlatest lattice results for the hadronic matrix elements, we calculate the ratio\n$\\epsilon_{K}^{\\prime}/\\epsilon_{K}$ (with $\\epsilon_{K}$ quantifying indirect\n$CP$ violation) in the Standard Model (SM) at NLO to\n$\\epsilon_{K}^{\\prime}/\\epsilon_{K} = (1.06 \\pm 5.07) \\times 10^{-4} $, which\nis $2.8\\,\\sigma$ below the experimental value. We also present the evolution\nmatrix in the high-energy regime for calculations of new physics contributions\nand derive easy-to-use approximate formulae. We find that the RG amplification\nof new-physics contributions to Wilson coefficients of the electroweak penguin\noperators is further enhanced by the NLO corrections: If the new contribution\nis generated at the scale of 1-10 TeV, the RG evolution between the new-physics\nscale and the electroweak scale enhances these coefficients by 50-100 %. Our\nsolution contains a term of order $\\alpha_{EM}^2/\\alpha_s^2$, which is\nnumerically unimportant for the SM case but should be included in studies of\nhigh-scale new-physics.\n", "  We study the origin of neutrino mass from $SO(10)$ arising from $M$ Theory\ncompactified on a $G_2$-manifold. This is linked to the problem of the breaking\nof the extra $U(1)$ gauge group, in the $SU(5)\\times U(1)$ subgroup of\n$SO(10)$, which we show can achieved via a (generalised) Kolda-Martin\nmechanism. The resulting neutrino masses arise from a combination of the seesaw\nmechanism and induced R-parity breaking contributions. The rather complicated\nneutrino mass matrix is analysed for one neutrino family and it is shown how\nphenomenologically acceptable neutrino masses can emerge.\n", "  Predicting how much mixing occurs when a given amount of energy is injected\ninto a Boussinesq fluid is a longstanding problem in stratified turbulence. The\nhuge number of degrees of freedom involved in those processes renders extremely\ndifficult a deterministic approach to the problem. Here we present a\nstatistical mechanics approach yielding prediction for a cumulative, global\nmixing efficiency as a function of a global Richardson number and the\nbackground buoyancy profile.\n", "  It is demonstrated that the forbidden lines, which must be present in the\nSERS, TERS and SEIRA spectra of molecules with sufficiently high symmetry,\nassociated with a strong quadrupole light-molecule interaction, are absent in\nthe fullerene C60. This result is an experimental manifestation of an\nelectrodynamical forbiddance of the strong quadrupole light-molecule\ninteraction, which must be not only in molecules with cubic symmetry groups,\nbut in the fullerene C60 also.\n", "  A new tuning mechanism is demonstrated for single-mode metal-clad plasmonic\nlasers, in which refractive-index of the laser's surrounding medium affects the\nresonant-cavity mode in the same vein as refractive-index of gain medium inside\nthe cavity. Reversible, continuous, and mode-hop-free tuning of ~57GHz is\nrealized for single-mode narrow-beam terahertz plasmonic quantum-cascade lasers\n(QCLs), which is demonstrated at much more practical temperature of 78K. The\ntuning is based on post-process deposition/etching of a dielectric\n(Silicon-dioxide) on a QCL chip that has already been soldered and wire-bonded\nonto a copper mount. This is a considerably larger tuning range compared to\npreviously reported results for terahertz QCLs with directional far-field\nradiation patterns. The key enabling mechanism for tuning is a recently\ndeveloped antenna-feedback scheme for plasmonic lasers, which leads to\ngeneration of hybrid surface-plasmon-polaritons propagating outside the cavity\nof the laser with a large spatial extent. The effect of dielectric deposition\non QCL's characteristics is investigated in detail including that on maximum\noperating temperature, peak output power and far-field radiation patterns.\nSingle-lobed beam with low divergence (<7deg) is maintained through the tuning\nrange. The antenna-feedback scheme is ideally suited for modulation of\nplasmonic lasers and their sensing applications due to the sensitive dependence\nof spectral and radiative properties of the laser on its surrounding medium.\n", "  We calculate formation probabilities of the ground state of the finite size\nquantum critical chains using conformal field theory (CFT) techniques. In\nparticular, we calculate the formation probability of one interval in the\nfinite open chain and also formation probability of two disjoint intervals in a\nfinite periodic system. The presented formulas can be also interpreted as the\nCasimir energy of needles in particular geometries. We numerically check the\nvalidity of the exact CFT results in the case of the transverse field Ising\nchain.\n", "  The quantum electrodynamics (QED) corrections are directly incorporated into\nthe most accurate treatment of the correlation corrections for ions with\ncomplex electronic structure of interest to metrology and tests of fundamental\nphysics. We compared the performance of four different QED potentials for\nvarious systems to access the accuracy of QED calculations and to make\nprediction of highly charged ion properties urgently needed for planning future\nexperiments. We find that all four potentials give consistent and reliable\nresults for ions of interest. For the strongly bound electrons the nonlocal\npotentials are more accurate than the local potential.\n", "  We extend our prescription for the construction of a covariant and\nbackground-independent effective action for scalar quantum field theories to\nthe case where momentum modes below a certain scale are suppressed by the\npresence of an infrared regulator. The key step is an appropriate choice of the\ninfrared cutoff for which the Ward identity, capturing the information from\nsingle-field dependence of the ultraviolet action, continues to be exactly\nsolvable, and therefore, in addition to covariance, manifest background\nindependence of the effective action is guaranteed at any scale. A practical\nconsequence is that in this framework one can adopt truncations dependent on\nthe single total field. Furthermore we discuss the necessary and sufficient\nconditions for the preservation of symmetries along the renormalization group\nflow.\n", "  We investigate analytically and numerically the nonstationary circuit QED\nsetup in which $N$ independent qubits interact with a single mode of the\nElectromagnetic field confined in a resonator. We consider the harmonic time\nmodulation of some parameter (atomic transition frequency or the atom-field\ncoupling strength) and derive the unitary dynamics up to the second order in\nthe modulation depth for $N=1$ and $N\\gg 1$. It is shown that all the resonant\nphenomena that occur for modulation frequencies $\\sim 2\\omega _{0}$ (where\n$\\omega _{0}$ is the cavity frequency) also occur for the halved frequencies.\nHowever, in the latter case the associated transition rates are significantly\nsmaller and the modulation of the coupling strength is less effective. The\ntransition rates are evaluated explicitly and the prospects of employing the\nsecond-order resonances in the phenomena related to the dynamical Casimir\neffect are examined.\n", "  In this work we construct a infinite dimensional $\\ell$-super Galilean\nconformal algebra, which is a generalization of the $\\ell=1$ algebra found in\nthe literature. We give a classification of central extensions, the vector\nfield representation, the coadjoint representation and the operator product\nexpansion of the infinite dimensional $\\ell$-super Galilean conformal algebra,\nkeeping possible applications in physics and mathematics in mind.\n", "  The deformed supersymmetric sine-Gordon model, obtained through known\ndeformation of the corresponding potential, is found to be quasi-integrable,\nlike its non-supersymmetric counterpart, which was observed earlier. The system\nexpectedly possesses finite number of conserved quantities, leaving-out an\ninfinite number of non-conserved anomalous charges. The quasi-integrability of\nthis supersymmetric model heavily rely on the boundary conditions of the\npotential, otherwise rendered to be completely non-integrable. Moreover,\ninteresting additional algebraic structures appear, absent in the\nnon-supersymmetric counterparts.\n", "  We report on the measurement of the analyzing power for the (vec)pp->ppeta\nreaction with beam momenta of 2026 MeV/c and 2188 MeV/c performed with the\nWASA-at-COSY detector at the Cooler Synchrotron COSY. The eta meson from the\n(vec)pp-> ppeta reaction was identified by the techniques of missing mass and\ninvariant mass. The angular distribution of the determined analyzing power\nstrongly disagree with theoretical predictions. A comparison of the obtained Ay\nangular distribution with a series of associated Legendre polynomials revealed\nnegligible contribution of the Sd partial wave at Q = 15 MeV. However, at Q =\n72 MeV, a significant interference of the Ps and Pp partial waves was observed.\n", "  We propose a new type of broadband and low repetition rate frequency comb\ngenerator which has the shape of an elongated and nanoscale-shallow optical\nbottle microresonator created at the surface of an optical fiber. The free\nspectral range (FSR) of the broadband azimuthal eigenfrequency series of this\nresonator is the exact multiple of the FSR of the dense and narrowband axial\nseries. The effective radius variation of the microresonator is close to a\nparabola with a nanoscale height which is greater or equal to lambda/2pi*n0\n(here lambda is the characteristic radiation wavelength and n0 is the\nrefractive index of the microresonator material). Overall, the microresonator\npossesses a broadband, small FSR, and accurately equidistant spectrum\nconvenient for the generation of a broadband and low repetition rate optical\nfrequency comb. It is shown that this comb can be generated by pumping with a\ncw laser, which radiation frequency matches a single axial eigenfrequency of\nthe microresonator, or, alternatively, by pumping with a mode-locked laser,\nwhich generates a narrowband low repetition rate comb matching a series of\nequidistant axial eigenfrequencies situated between adjacent azimuthal\neigenfrequencies.\n", "  We investigate magnetic phase in the bilayer system of ultra-cold bosons in\nan optical lattice, which is involved with Raman-induced spin-orbit (SO)\ncoupling and laser-assisted interlayer tunneling. It is shown that there exit a\nrich of spin textures such as hetero ferromagnet, heterochiral magnet, chiral\nmagnet with interlayer antiferromagnet. In particular, heterochiral magnet\ninduced by SO coupling occurs extremely rarely in real solid-state materials.\nWe present detailed experimental setup of realizing such a model in cold atom\nsystem.\n", "  Intensified charge coupled device (ICCD) cameras are widely used in various\napplications such as microscopy, astronomy, spectroscopy. Often they are used\nas single-photon detectors, with thresholding being an essential part of the\nreadout. In this paper, we measure the quantum efficiency of an ICCD camera in\nthe single-photon detection mode using the Klyshko absolute calibration\ntechnique. The quantum efficiency is obtained as a function of the threshold\nvalue and of the wavelength of the detected light. In addition, we study the\nhomogeneity of the photon sensitivity over the camera chip area. The experiment\nis performed in the autonomous regime, without using any additional detectors.\nWe therefore demonstrate the self-calibration of an ICCD camera.\n", "  The Density of States Functional Fit Approach (DoS FFA) is a recently\nproposed modern density of states technique suitable for calculations in\nlattice field theories with a complex action problem. In this article we\npresent an exploratory implementation of DoS FFA for the SU(3) spin system at\nfinite chemical potential $\\mu$ - an effective theory for the Polyakov loop.\nThis model has a complex action problem similar to the one of QCD but also\nallows for a dual simulation in terms of worldlines where the complex action\nproblem is solved. Thus we can compare the DoS FFA results to the reference\ndata from the dual simulation and assess the performance of the new approach.\nWe find that the method reproduces the observables from the dual simulation for\na large range of $\\mu$ values, including also phase transitions, illustrating\nthat DoS FFA is an interesting approach for exploring phase diagrams of lattice\nfield theories with a complex action problem.\n", "  An increase of the magnetic moment in superconductor/ferromagnet (S/F)\nbilayers V(40nm)/F [F$=$Fe(1,3nm), Co(3nm), Ni(3nm)] was observed using SQUID\nmagnetometry upon cooling below the superconducting transition temperature Tc\nin magnetic fields of 10 Oe to 50 Oe applied parallel to the sample surface. A\nsimilar increase, often called the paramagnetic Meissner effect (PME), was\nobserved before in various superconductors and superconductor/ferromagnet\nsystems. To explain the PME effect in the presented S/F bilayers a model based\non a row of vortices located at the S/F interface is proposed. According to the\nmodel the magnetic moment induced below Tc consists of the paramagnetic\ncontribution of the vortex cores and the diamagnetic contribution of the\nvortex-free region of the S layer. Since the thickness of the S layer is found\nto be 3-4 times less than the magnetic field penetration depth, this latter\ndiamagnetic contribution is negligible. The model correctly accounts for the\nsign, the approximate magnitude and the field dependence of the paramagnetic\nand the Meissner contributions of the induced magnetic moment upon passing the\nsuperconducting transition of a ferromagnet/superconductor bilayer.\n", "  In this paper, we examine the behavior of modes of the Kerr geometry when the\nmode's frequency is purely imaginary. We demonstrate that quasinormal modes\nmust be polynomial in nature if their frequency is purely imaginary, and\npresent a method for computing such modes. The nature of these modes, however,\nis not always easy to determine. Some of the polynomial modes we compute are\nquasinormal modes. However, some are simultaneously quasinormal modes and total\ntransmission modes, while others fail to satisfy the requisite boundary\nconditions for either. This analysis is, in part, an extension of the results\nknown for Schwarzschild black holes, but clarifies misconceptions for the\nbehavior of modes when the black hole has angular momentum. We also show that\nthe algebraically special modes of Kerr with m=0 have an additional branch of\nsolutions not seen before in the literature. All of these results are in\nprecise agreement with new numerical solutions for sequences of gravitational\nquasinormal modes of Kerr. However, we show that some prior numerical and\nanalytic results concerning the existence of quasinormal modes of Kerr with\npurely imaginary frequencies were incorrect.\n", "  In this paper, the optical properties and imaging performance of a non-ideal\nPendry's negative index flat lens with a practical value for loss are studied.\nAnalytical calculations of the optical properties of the lens are performed,\nand those results are used to further study the lens and corresponding imaging\nsystem numerically. The plasmon injection scheme for loss compensation in\nnegative index metamaterials is applied to the results from the imaging system,\nresulting in a perfect reconstruction of a previously unresolved image that\ndemonstrates sub-diffraction-limit resolution.\n", "  Dissipative Kerr solitons have recently been generated in optical\nmicroresonators, enabling ultrashort optical pulses at microwave repetition\nrates, that constitute coherent and numerically predictable Kerr frequency\ncombs. However, the seeding and excitation of the temporal solitons is\nassociated with changes in the intracavity power, that can lead to large\nthermal resonance shifts during the excitation process and render the soliton\nstates in most commonly used resonator platforms short lived. Here we describe\na \"power kicking\" method to overcome this instability by modulating the power\nof the pump laser. A fast modulation triggers the soliton formation, while a\nslow adjustment of the power compensates the thermal effect during the\nexcitation laser scan. With this method also initially very short-lived (100ns)\nsoliton states , as encountered in SiN integrated photonic microresonators, can\nbe brought into a steady state in contrast to techniques reported earlier which\nrelied on an adjustment of the laser scan speed only. Once the soliton state is\nin a steady state it can persist for hours and is thermally self-locked.\n", "  Colloidal particles are considered ideal building blocks to produce materials\nwith enhanced physical properties. The state-of-the-art techniques for\nsynthesizing these particles provide control over shape, size, and\ndirectionality of the interactions. In spite of these advances, there is still\na huge gap between the synthesis of individual components and the management of\ntheir spontaneous organization towards the desired structures. The main\nchallenge is the control over the dynamics of self-organization. In their\nkinetic route towards thermodynamically stable structures, colloidal particles\nself-organize into intermediate (mesoscopic) structures that are much larger\nthan the individual particles and become the relevant units for the dynamics.\nTo follow the dynamics and identify kinetically trapped structures, one needs\nto develop new theoretical and numerical tools. Here we discuss the\nself-organization of functionalized colloids (also known as patchy colloids) on\nattractive substrates. We review our recent results on the adsorption and\nrelaxation and explore the use of annealing cycles to overcome kinetic barriers\nand drive the relaxation towards the targeted structures.\n", "  We present a theoretical study of the spatial Goos-H\\\"anchen shift occurring\nat the interface between two different photonic graphene lattices. Numerical\nsimulations of light propagation in such a wave guiding system are also\npresented to corroborate our findings.\n", "  6d SCFTs compactified on a circle can often be studied from nonperturbative\n5d super-Yang-Mills theories, using instanton solitons. However, the 5d\nYang-Mills theories with 6d UV fixed points frequently have too many\nhypermultiplet matters, which makes it difficult to use the ADHM techniques for\ninstantons. With the examples of 6d $\\mathcal{N}=(1,0)$ SCFTs with $Sp(N)$\ngauge symmetry and $2N+8$ fundamental hypermultiplets, we show that one can\nstill make rigorous studies of these 5d-6d relations in the `fractional D-brane\nsectors'. We test the recently proposed 5d duals given by $Sp(N+1)$ gauge\ntheories, and compare their instanton partition functions with the elliptic\ngenera of 6d self-dual strings.\n", "  We demonstrate that the resonant medium with essentially nonlinear field\ncoupling can exhibit specific response when excited by the few-cycle optical\npulse. We provide an effective theoretical background that allows relating the\ntype of the field coupling function with the medium oscillators output on the\nfew-cycle pulse-driven excitation. Possible applications of such the optical\nresponse are discussed for the controllable generation and shaping of the\nunipolar video pulses.\n", "  We study theoretically a new possibility of unipolar pulses generation in\nRaman-active medium excited by a series of few-cycle optical pulses. We\nconsider the case when the Raman-active particles are uniformly distributed\nalong the circle, and demonstrate a possibility to obtain a unipolar\nrectangular video pulses with an arbitrarily long duration, ranging from a\nminimum value equal to the natural period of the low frequency vibrations in\nthe Raman-active medium.\n", "  We have long speculated \\cite{1nbs,2nbs,3nbs,4nbs,5nbs,\n6nbs,7nbs,8nbs,9nbs,10nbs,11nbs,12nbs, 13nbs,14nbs,LNvacuumstability} , that 6\ntop + 6 anti-top quarks due to the realtively large size of the top-yukawa\ncoupling would bind exceptionaly strongly by mainly Higgs exchange. Here we\npresent a surprisingly simple \"calculation\" of the mass of this speculated\nbound state. Even a possible resonance in scattering of two such bound states\nis speculated. For the \"calculation\" of the masses it is crucial to assume,\nthat our since long speculated principle \"Multiple Point\nPrinciple\"\\cite{5mp,6mp,7mp,8mp,9mp,10mp, 11mp,12mp,13mp,14mp,15mp,16mp,17mp,\nderiving}, is true. This principle says: {\\em there are several vacua all\nhaving almost zero energy density}. Further we make an approximation of the\nHiggs Yukawa potential essentially replacing the exponential in it by a\nstep-function. The new result means that there are now two independent calls\nfor our bound state having the mass around 750 GeV required by our \"new law of\nnature\" the Multiple Point Principle. It should be remarked that in our picture\nthere is {\\em no new physics} in the sense of new fundamental particles, but\nthe \"Multiple Point Principle\" is new in the sense of being not yet accepted.\nFurther we get the {\\em same} mass within uncertainties as\nearlier\\cite{LNvacuumstability} but now from a completly different assumption,\nexcept for being from our \"multiple point principle\". But the two masses are\ngotten from using\n  {\\em different} (speculative) vacua occuring in the pure Standard Model.\n", "  In this paper we construct a new factorized representation of the $R$-matrix\nrelated to the affine algebra $U_{q}(\\widehat{sl_{n}})$ for symmetric tensor\nrepresentations with arbitrary weights. Using the 3D approach we obtain\nexplicit formulas for the matrix elements of the $R$-matrix and give a simple\nproof that a \"twisted\" $R$-matrix is stochastic. We also discuss symmetries of\nthe $R$-matrix, its degenerations and compare our formulas with other results\navailable in the literature.\n", "  The lowest $v=0$ level of the A$^1\\Pi$, state of the $^{13}$C$^{16}$O\nisotopologue of carbon monoxide has been reinvestigated with a variety of high\nresolution spectroscopic techniques. The A$^1\\Pi-$X$^1\\Sigma^+(0,0)$ band has\nbeen studied by vacuum-ultraviolet Fourier-transform absorption spectroscopy,\nusing the SOLEIL synchrotron as a radiation source. Spectra were obtained under\nquasi-static gas conditions at liquid-nitrogen temperature, room temperature\nand at an elevated temperature of 900 K, with absolute accuracies of\n0.01$-$0.03 cm$^{-1}$. Two-photon Doppler-free laser spectroscopy has been\napplied to a limited number of transitions in the A$^1\\Pi-$X$^1\\Sigma^+(0,0)$\nband, under collision-free circumstances of a molecular beam, yielding an\nabsolute accuracy of 0.002 cm$^{-1}$. The third technique is high-resolution\nFourier-transform emission spectroscopy in the visible region applied to the\nB$^1\\Sigma^+-$A$^1\\Pi(0,0)$ band in a gas discharge, at an absolute accuracy of\nup to 0.003 cm$^{-1}$. With these methods rotational levels of A$^1\\Pi(0)$\ncould be studied in both parity components up to a rotational quantum number of\n$J=46$. The frequencies of 397 transitions were used to analyse the\nperturbations between the A$^1\\Pi(0)$ level by vibrational levels of the\nD$^1\\!\\Delta$, e$^3\\Sigma^-$, d$^3\\!\\Delta$, and a$'^3\\Sigma^+$ states.\n", "  When the weak value of a projector is 1, a quantum system behaves as in that\neigenstate with probability 1. By definition, however, the weak value may take\nan anomalous value lying outside the range of probability like -1. From the\nviewpoint of a physical effect, we show that such a negative weak value of -1\ncan be regarded as the counterpart of the ordinary value of 1. Using photons,\nwe experimentally verify it as the symmetrical shift in polarization depending\non the weak value given by pre-postselection of the path state. Unlike\nobservation of a weak value as an ensemble average via weak measurements, the\neffect of a weak value is definitely confirmed in two photon interference: the\nsymmetrical shift corresponding to the weak value can be directly observed as\nthe rotation angle of a half wave plate.\n", "  The Andromeda Galaxy recurrent nova M31N 2008-12a had been observed in\neruption ten times, including yearly eruptions from 2008-2014. With a measured\nrecurrence period of $P_\\mathrm{rec}=351\\pm13$ days (we believe the true value\nto be half of this) and a white dwarf very close to the Chandrasekhar limit,\nM31N 2008-12a has become the leading pre-explosion supernova type Ia progenitor\ncandidate. Following multi-wavelength follow-up observations of the 2013 and\n2014 eruptions, we initiated a campaign to ensure early detection of the\npredicted 2015 eruption, which triggered ambitious ground and space-based\nfollow-up programs. In this paper we present the 2015 detection; visible to\nnear-infrared photometry and visible spectroscopy; and ultraviolet and X-ray\nobservations from the Swift observatory. The LCOGT 2m (Hawaii) discovered the\n2015 eruption, estimated to have commenced at Aug. $28.28\\pm0.12$ UT. The\n2013-2015 eruptions are remarkably similar at all wavelengths. New early\nspectroscopic observations reveal short-lived emission from material with\nvelocities $\\sim13000$ km s$^{-1}$, possibly collimated outflows. Photometric\nand spectroscopic observations of the eruption provide strong evidence\nsupporting a red giant donor. An apparently stochastic variability during the\nearly super-soft X-ray phase was comparable in amplitude and duration to past\neruptions, but the 2013 and 2015 eruptions show evidence of a brief flux dip\nduring this phase. The multi-eruption Swift/XRT spectra show tentative evidence\nof high-ionization emission lines above a high-temperature continuum. Following\nHenze et al. (2015a), the updated recurrence period based on all known\neruptions is $P_\\mathrm{rec}=174\\pm10$ d, and we expect the next eruption of\nM31N 2008-12a to occur around mid-Sep. 2016.\n", "  We discuss other contributions to the vacuum energy of quantum field theories\nand quantum gravity, which have not been considered in literature. As is well\nknown, the presence of virtual particles in vacuum provides the so famous and\npuzzling contributions to the vacuum energy. As is well known, these mainly\ncome from loop integrations over the four-momenta space. However, we argue that\nthese also imply the presence of a mass density of virtual particles in every\nvolume cell of space-time. The most important contribution comes from quantum\ngravity $S^{2}\\times S^{2}$ bubbles, corresponding to virtual black hole pairs.\nThe presence of virtual masses could lead to another paradox: the space-time\nitself would have an intrinsic virtual mass density contribution leading to a\ndisastrous contraction - as is known, no negative masses exist in general\nrelativity. We dub this effect {\\it the cosmological problem of second type}:\nif not other counter-terms existed, the vacuum energy would be inevitably\ndestabilized by virtual-mass contributions. It would be conceivable that the\ncosmological problem of second type could solve the first one. Virtual masses\nrenormalize the vacuum energy to an unpredicted parameter, as in the\nrenormalization procedure of the Standard Model charges. In the limit of\n$M_{Pl}\\rightarrow \\infty$ (Pauli-Villars limit), virtual black holes have a\nmass density providing an infinite counter-term to the vacuum energy divergent\ncontribution $M_{Pl} \\rightarrow \\infty$ (assuming $M_{UV}=M_{Pl}$). Therefore,\nin the same Schwinger-Feynman-Tomonaga attitude, the problem of a divergent\nvacuum energy could be analogous to the {\\it put-by-hand} procedure used for\nStandard Model parameters.\n", "  Rapid characterization of optical and vibrational spectra with high\nresolution can identify species in cluttered environments and is important for\nassays and early alerts. In this regard, dual-comb spectroscopy has emerged as\na powerful approach to acquire nearly instantaneous Raman and optical spectra\nwith unprecedented resolution. Spectra are generated directly in the electrical\ndomain and avoid bulky mechanical spectrometers. Recently, a miniature\nsoliton-based comb has emerged that can potentially transfer the dual-comb\nmethod to a chip platform. Unlike earlier microcombs, these new devices achieve\nhigh-coherence, pulsed mode locking. They generate broad, reproducible spectral\nenvelopes, which is essential for dual-comb spectroscopy. Here, dual-comb\nspectroscopy is demonstrated using these devices. This work shows the potential\nfor integrated, high signal-to-noise spectroscopy with fast acquisition rates.\n", "  In this work we study sulfur confined between two multilayer graphene films\nunder thermal treatments by means of electrical and Raman spectroscopy\ncharacterization. We found some similarities between the electrical behavior\nand differential scanning calorimetry of sulfur immersed into nanoporous anodic\nalumina template during sulfur phase transitions, this suggests that sulfur has\na different thermal behavior when it is in confining conditions compared to the\nfree state. In addition, multilayer graphene was exposed to sulfur vapors at\n500 {\\deg}C to induce chemical reaction. This method effectively produced\ncovalent bonding between sulfur and multilayer graphene and a p-type doping of\nabout 2x10^13 cm^-2 in charge concentration. Finally, based on first principle\ncalculations we speculate on the existence of a new bidimensional structure of\nsulfur.\n", "  We investigate the effect of tunable optical feedback on a commercial DFB\nlaser edge coupled to a Silicon Photonics planar integrated circuit in which a\ntunable reflector has been implemented by means of a ring resonator based\nadd-drop multiplexer. Controlled optical feedback allows for fine-tuning of the\nlaser oscillation frequency. Under certain conditions it also allows\nsuppression of bifurcation modes triggered by reflections occurring elsewhere\non the chip. A semi-analytical model describing laser dynamics under combined\noptical feedback from the input facet of the edge coupler and from the tunable\non-chip reflector fits the measurements. Compensation of detrimental effects\nfrom reflections induced elsewhere on a transceiver chip may allow moving\nisolators downstream in future communications systems, facilitating direct\nhybrid laser integration in Silicon Photonics chips, provided a suitable\nfeedback signal for a control system can be identified. Moreover, the optical\nfrequency tuning at lower feedback levels can be used to form a rapidly tunable\noptical oscillator as part of an optical phase locked loop, circumventing the\nproblem of the thermal to free carrier effect crossover in the FM response of\ninjection current controlled semiconductor laser diodes.\n", "  Generalized squeezing rotating-wave approximation (GSRWA) is proposed by\nemploying both the displacement and the squeezing transformations. A solvable\nHamiltonian is reformulated in the same form as the ordinary RWA ones. For a\nqubit coupled to oscillators experiment, a well-defined\nSchr\\\"{o}dinger-cat-like entangled state is given by the displaced-squeezed\noscillator state instead of the original displaced state. For the isotropic\nRabi case, the mean photon number and the ground-state energy are expressed\nanalytically with additional squeezing terms, exhibiting a substantial\nimprovement of the GSRWA. And the ground-state energy in the anisotropic Rabi\nmodel confirms the effectiveness of the GSRWA. Due to the squeezing effect, the\nGSRWA improves the previous methods only with the displacement transformation\nin a wide range of coupling strengths even for large atom frequency.\n", "  Fusion - fission probabilities in the synthesis of heaviest elements are\ndiscussed in the context of the latest experimental reports. Cross sections for\nsuperheavy nuclei are evaluated using \"Fusion by Diffusion\" (FBD) model.\nPredictive power of this approach is shown for experimentally known Lv, Og\nisotopes and predictions given for Z=119,120. Ground state and saddle point\nproperties as: masses, shell corrections, pairing energies and deformations\nnecessary for cross section estimations are calculated systematically within\nthe multidimensional microscopic - macroscopic method based on the deformed\nWoods-Saxon single particle potential. In the frame of FBD approach predictions\nfor production of elements heavier than Z = 118 are not too optimistic. For\nthis reason, and because of high instability of superheavy nuclei, we comment\non some structure effects, connected with the K-isomerism phenomenon which\ncould lead to a significant increase in the stability of these systems.\n", "  Optical excitation of apical oxygen vibrations in\nYBa$_{2}$Cu$_{3}$O$_{6+\\delta}$ has been shown to enhance its c-axis\nsuperconducting-phase rigidity, as evidenced by a transient blue shift of the\nequilibrium inter-bilayer Josephson plasma resonance. Surprisingly, a transient\nc-axis plasma mode could also be induced above T$_{c}$ by the same apical\noxygen excitation, suggesting light activated superfluid tunneling throughout\nthe pseudogap phase of YBa$_{2}$Cu$_{3}$O$_{6+\\delta}$. However, despite the\nsimilarities between the above T$_{c}$ transient plasma mode and the\nequilibrium Josephson plasmon, alternative explanations involving high mobility\nquasiparticle transport should be considered. Here, we report an extensive\nstudy of the relaxation of the light-induced plasmon into the equilibrium\nincoherent phase. These new experiments allow for a critical assessment of the\nnature of this mode. We determine that the transient plasma relaxes through a\ncollapse of its coherence length rather than its carrier (or superfluid)\ndensity. These observations are not easily reconciled with quasiparticle\ninterlayer transport, and rather support transient superfluid tunneling as the\norigin of the light-induced interlayer coupling in\nYBa$_{2}$Cu$_{3}$O$_{6+\\delta}$.\n", "  We discuss the $\\{ \\beta \\}$-expansion for renormalization group invariant\nquantities tracing this expansion to the different contractions of the\ncorresponding incomplete BPHZ $R$-operation. All of the coupling\nrenormalizations, which follow from these contractions, should be taken into\naccount for the $\\{ \\beta \\}$-expansion. We illustrate this feature considering\nthe nonsinglet Adler function $D^\\text{NS}$ in the third order of perturbation.\nWe propose a generalization of the $\\{ \\beta \\}$-expansion for the\nrenormalization group covariant quantities -- the $\\{ \\beta,\\gamma\n\\}$-expansion.\n", "  We develop a mesoscopic dislocation dynamics model for vacancy-assisted\ndislocation climb by upscalings from a stochastic model on the atomistic scale.\nOur models incorporate microscopic mechanisms of (i) bulk diffusion of\nvacancies, (ii) vacancy exchange dynamics between bulk and dislocation core,\n(iii) vacancy pipe diffusion along the dislocation core, and (iv) vacancy\nattachment-detachment kinetics at jogs leading to the motion of jogs. Our\nmesoscopic model consists of the vacancy bulk diffusion equation and a\ndislocation climb velocity formula. The effects of pipe diffusion and the jog\nstructure on dislocations are incorporated by a Robin boundary condition near\nthe dislocations for the bulk diffusion equation and a new contribution in the\ndislocation climb velocity due to vacancy pipe diffusion driven by the stress\nvariation along the dislocation. Our climb formulation is able to\nquantitatively describe the translation of prismatic loops at low temperatures\nwhen the bulk diffusion is negligible. Using this new formulation, we derive\nanalytical formulas for the climb velocity of a straight edge dislocation and a\nprismatic circular loop. Our dislocation climb formulation can be implemented\nin dislocation dynamics simulations to incorporate all the above four\nmicroscopic mechanisms of dislocation climb.\n", "  We study numerically the spin-1/2 XXZ model in a field on an infinite Kagome\nlattice. We use different algorithms based on infinite Projected Entangled Pair\nStates (iPEPS) for this, namely: (i) with simplex tensors and 9-site unit cell,\nand (ii) coarse-graining three spins in the Kagome lattice and mapping it to a\nsquare-lattice model with nearest-neighbor interactions, with usual PEPS\ntensors, 6- and 12-site unit cells. Similarly to our previous calculation at\nthe SU(2)-symmetric point (Heisenberg Hamiltonian), for any anisotropy from the\nIsing limit to the XY limit, we also observe the emergence of magnetization\nplateaus as a function of the magnetic field, at $m_z = \\frac{1}{3}$ using 6-\n9- and 12-site PEPS unit cells, and at $m_z = \\frac{1}{9}, \\frac{5}{9}$ and\n$\\frac{7}{9}$ using a 9-site PEPS unit cell, the later set-up being able to\naccommodate $\\sqrt{3} \\times \\sqrt{3}$ solid order. We also find that, at $m_z\n= \\frac{1}{3}$, (lattice) nematic and $\\sqrt{3} \\times \\sqrt{3}$ VBC-order\nstates are degenerate within the accuracy of the 9-site simplex-method, for all\nanisotropy. The 6- and 12-site coarse-grained PEPS methods produce\nalmost-degenerate nematic and $1 \\times 2$ VBC-Solid orders. Within our\naccuracy, the 6-site coarse-grained PEPS method gives slightly lower energies,\nwhich can be explained by the larger amount of entanglement this approach can\nhandle, even when the PEPS unit-cell is not commensurate with the expected\nground state. Furthermore, we do not observe chiral spin liquid behaviors at\nand close to the XY point, as has been recently proposed. Our results are the\nfirst tensor network investigations of the XXZ spin chain in a field, and\nreveal the subtle competition between nearby magnetic orders in numerical\nsimulations of frustrated quantum antiferromagnets, as well as the delicate\ninterplay between energy optimization and symmetry in tensor networks.\n", "  We study a new approach for the wormhole construction in Einstein-Born-Infeld\ngravity, which does not require exotic matters in the Einstein equation. The\nBorn-Infeld field equation is not modified from \"coordinate independent\"\nconditions of continuous metric tensor and its derivatives, even though the\nBorn-Infeld fields have discontinuities in their derivatives at the throat in\ngeneral. We study the relation of the newly introduced conditions with the\nusual continuity equation for the energy-momentum tensor and the gravitational\nBianchi identity. We find that there is no violation of energy conditions for\nthe Born-Infeld fields contrary to the usual approaches. The exoticity of\nenergy-momentum tensor is not essential for sustaining wormholes. Some open\nproblems are discussed.\n", "  We explore the problem of atomic collapse in graphene by monopole impurities,\nboth electric and magnetic, within the context of supersymmetric quantum\nmechanics. For electric impurities, upon factorizing the radial Dirac\nHamiltonian and identifying the supercharges, existence of a critical charge\nthat makes the ground state {\\em fall-into-the-center} translates into lost of\nhermicity for the corresponding Hamiltonian and hence lost of unitarity of the\ntheory. For the problem of magnetic monopole impurities, preservation of\nunitarity for all values of the parameters of the corresponding potential\ntranslates into the absence of atomic collapse in this case.\n", "  We derive the atomistic representations of the elastic tensors appearing in\nthe linearized theory of first strain-gradient elasticity for an arbitrary\nmulti-lattice. In addition to the classical (2nd-Piola) stress and elastic\nmoduli tensors, these include the rank-three double-stress tensor, the\nrank-five tensor of mixed elastic moduli, and the rank-six tensor of\nstrain-gradient elastic moduli. The atomistic representations are closed-form\nanalytical expressions in terms of the first and second derivatives of the\ninteratomic potential with respect to interatomic distances, and dyadic\nproducts of relative atomic positions. Moreover, all expressions are local, in\nthe sense that they depend only on the atomic neighborhood of a lattice site.\nOur results emanate from the condition of energetic equivalence between\ncontinuum and atomistic representations of a crystal, when the kinematics of\nthe latter is governed by the Cauchy-Born rule. Using the derived expressions,\nwe prove that the odd-order tensors vanish if the lattice basis admits\ncentral-symmetry. The analytical expressions are implemented as a KIM compliant\nalgorithm to compute the strain gradient elastic tensors for various materials.\nNumerical results are presented to compare representative interatomic\npotentials used in the literature for cubic crystals, including simple lattices\nand multi-lattices. We observe that central potentials exhibit generalized\nCauchy relations for the rank-six tensor of strain-gradient elastic moduli. In\naddition, this tensor is found to be indefinite for many potentials. We discuss\nthe relationship between indefiniteness and material stability. Finally, the\natomistic representations are specialized to central potentials in simple\nlattices. These expressions are used with analytical potentials to study the\nsensitivity of the elastic tensors to the choice of the cutoff radius.\n", "  Using the sum-rules, the sum-over-states expression for the diagonal term of\nfirst hyperpolarizability can be expressed as the sum of three-state\ninteraction terms. We study the behavior of a generic three-state term to show\nthat is possible to tune the contribution of resonant terms by tuning the\nspectrum of the molecule. When extrapolated to the off-resonance regime, the\nthree-state interaction terms are shown to behave in a similar manner as the\nthree-level model used to derive the fundamental limits. We finally show that\nmost results derived using the three-level ansatz are general, and apply to\nmolecules where more than three levels contribute to the second-order nonlinear\nresponse or/and far from optimization.\n", "  We study the internal rotational dynamics of electronic beams in relation to\nthe phase singularities of their wave functions. Given their complex\nsingularity structure, Hermite-Gaussian beams and other superpositions of\nLaguerre-Gaussian modes are studied here. We show that by inspecting the lowest\nnon-vanishing terms of the wave function near the singularity it is possible to\ninfer the structure of the Bohmian streamlines. Conversely, starting from a map\nof the electron's Bohmian velocities, we demonstrate that it is possible to\nderive the form of the electron's wave function near the singularity. We\noutline a procedure that could yield an experimental method to determine the\nmain parameters of the electron's wave function close to a singularity.\n", "  In the Skyrme model of nucleons and nuclei, the spin excitation energy of the\nnucleon is traditionally calculated by a fit of the rigid rotor quantization of\nspin/isospin of the fundamental Skyrmion (the hedgehog) to the masses of the\nnucleon and the Delta resonance. The resulting, quite large spin excitation\nenergy of the nucleon of about $ 73\\, \\mbox{MeV}$ is, however, rather difficult\nto reconcile with the small binding energies of physical nuclei, among other\nproblems. Here we argue that a more reliable value for the spin excitation\nenergy of the nucleon, compatible with many physical constraints, is about $\n16\\, \\mbox{MeV}$. The fit of the rigid rotor to the Delta, on the other hand,\nis problematic in any case, because it implies the use of a nonrelativistic\nmethod for a highly relativistic system.\n", "  Proximity effects resulting from depositing a graphene layer on a TMD\nsubstrate layer change the dynamics of the electronic states in graphene,\ninducing spin orbit coupling (SOC) and staggered potential effects. An\neffective Hamiltonian that describes different symmetry breaking terms in\ngraphene, while preserving time reversal invariance, shows that an inverted\nmass band gap regime is possible. The competition of different perturbation\nterms causes a transition from an inverted mass phase to a staggered gap in the\nbilayer heterostructure, as seen in its phase diagram. A tight-binding\ncalculation of the bilayer validates the effective model parameters. A relative\ngate voltage between the layers may produce such phase transition in\nexperimentally accessible systems. The phases are characterized in terms of\nBerry curvature and valley Chern numbers, demonstrating that the system may\nexhibit quantum spin Hall and valley Hall effects.\n", "  The high quantum efficiencies (QE) of backside illuminated charge coupled\ndevices (CCD) has ushered in the age of the large scale astronomical survey.\nThe QE of these devices can be greater than 90 %, and is dependent upon the\noperating temperature, device thickness, backside charging mechanisms, and\nanti-reflection (AR) coatings. But at optical wavelengths the QE is well\napproximated as one minus the reflectance, thus the measurement of the backside\nreflectivity of these devices provides a second independent measure of their\nQE.\n  We have designed and constructed a novel instrument to measure the relative\nspecular reflectance of CCD detectors, with a significant portion of this\ndevice being constructed using a 3D fused deposition model (FDM) printer. This\ndevice implements both a monitor and measurement photodiode to simultaneously\ncollect incident and reflected measurements reducing errors introduced by the\nrelative reflectance calibration process. While most relative reflectometers\nare highly dependent upon a precisely repeatable target distance for accurate\nmeasurements, we have implemented a method of measurement which minimizes these\nerrors.\n  Using the reflectometer we have measured the reflectance of two types of\nHamamatsu CCD detectors. The first device is a Hamamatsu 2k x 4k backside\nilluminated high resistivity p-type silicon detector which has been optimized\nto operate in the blue from 380 nm - 650 nm. The second detector being a 2k x\n4k backside illuminated high resistivity p-type silicon detector optimized for\nuse in the red from 640 nm - 960 nm. We have not only been able to measure the\nreflectance of these devices as a function of wavelength we have also sampled\nthe reflectance as a function of position on the device, and found a reflection\ngradient across these devices.\n", "  We investigate the Peres-Horodecki positive partial transpose (PPT) criterion\nin the context of conserved quantities and derive a condition of in-\nseparability for a composite bipartite system depending only on the dimen-\nsions of its subsystems, which leads to a bi-linear entanglement witness for\nthe two qubit system. A separability inequality using generalized Schrodinger-\nRobertson uncertainty relation taking suitable operators, has been derived,\nwhich proves to be stronger than the bi-linear entanglement witness operator.\nIn the case of mixed density matrices, it identically distinguishes the\nseparable and non separable Werner states.\n", "  The aim of this paper is to introduce a new modified gravity theory named as\n$f(\\mathcal{G},T)$ gravity ($\\mathcal{G}$ and $T$ are the Gauss-Bonnet\ninvariant and trace of the energy-momentum tensor, respectively) and\ninvestigate energy conditions for two reconstructed models in the context of\nFRW universe. We formulate general field equations, divergence of\nenergy-momentum tensor, equation of motion for test particles as well as\ncorresponding energy conditions. The massive test particles follow non-geodesic\nlines of geometry due to the presence of extra force. We express energy\nconditions in terms of cosmological parameters like deceleration, jerk and snap\nparameters. The reconstruction technique is applied to this theory using de\nSitter and power-law cosmological solutions. We analyze energy bounds and\nobtain feasible constraints on free parameters.\n", "  T-branes are supersymmetric configurations described by multiple Dp-branes\nwith worldvolume flux and non-commuting vacuum expectation values for two of\nthe worldvolume scalars. When these values are much larger than the string\nscale this description breaks down. We show that in this regime the correct\ndescription of T-branes is in terms of a single Dp-brane, whose worldvolume\ncurvature encodes the T-brane data. We present the tale of the journey to reach\nthis picture, which takes us through T-dualities and rugby-ball-shaped brane\nconfigurations that no eye has gazed upon before.\n", "  We find the first smooth microstate geometries with non-Abelian fields. The\nsolutions constitute an extension of the BPS three-charge smooth microstates.\nThese consist in general families of regular supersymmetric solutions with\nnon-trivial topology, i.e. bubbles, of $\\mathcal{N}=1$, $d=5$\nSuper-Einstein-Yang-Mills theory, having the asymptotic charges of a black hole\nor black ring but with no horizon. The non-Abelian fields make their presence\nat the very heart of the microstate structure: the physical size of the bubbles\nis affected by the non-Abelian topological charge they carry, which combines\nwith the Abelian flux threading the bubbles to hold them up. Interestingly the\nnon-Abelian fields carry a set of adjustable continuous parameters that do not\nalter the asymptotics of the solutions but modify the local geometry. This\nfeature can be used to obtain a classically infinite number of microstate\nsolutions with the asymptotics of a single black hole or black ring.\n", "  The stochastic motions of a diffusing particle contain information concerning\nthe particle's interactions with binding partners and with its local\nenvironment. However, accurate determination of the underlying diffusive\nproperties, beyond normal diffusion, has remained challenging when analyzing\nparticle trajectories on an individual basis. Here, we introduce the maximum\nlikelihood estimator (MLE) for confined diffusion and fractional Brownian\nmotion. We demonstrate that this MLE yields improved estimation over\ntraditional mean square displacement analyses. We also introduce a model\nselection scheme (that we call mleBIC) that classifies individual trajectories\nto a given diffusion mode. We demonstrate the statistical limitations of\nclassification via mleBIC using simulated data. To overcome these limitations,\nwe introduce a new version of perturbation expectation-maximization (pEMv2),\nwhich simultaneously analyzes a collection of particle trajectories to uncover\nthe system of interactions which give rise to unique normal and/or non-normal\ndiffusive states within the population. We test and evaluate the performance of\npEMv2 on various sets of simulated particle trajectories, which transition\namong several modes of normal and non-normal diffusion, highlighting the key\nconsiderations for employing this analysis methodology.\n", "  We study T-duality chains of five-branes in heterotic supergravity where the\nfirst order $\\alpha'$-corrections are present. By performing the\n$\\alpha'$-corrected T-duality transformations of the heterotic NS5-brane\nsolutions, we obtain the KK5-brane and the exotic $5^2_2$-brane solutions\nassociated with the symmetric, the neutral and the gauge NS5-branes. We find\nthat the Yang-Mills gauge field in these solutions satisfies the self-duality\ncondition in the three- and two-dimensional transverse spaces to the brane\nworld-volumes. The $O(2,2)$ monodromy structures of the $5^2_2$-brane solutions\nare investigated by the $\\alpha'$-corrected generalized metric. Our analysis\nshows that the symmetric $5^2_2$-brane solution, which satisfies the standard\nembedding condition, is a T-fold and it exhibits the non-geometric nature. We\nalso find that the neutral $5^2_2$-brane solution is a T-fold at least at\n$\\mathcal{O} (\\alpha')$. On the other hand, the gauge $5^2_2$-brane solution is\nnot a T-fold but show unusual structures of space-time.\n", "  Since the launch of ESA's Gaia satellite in December 2013, the 106\nlarge-format scientific CCDs onboard have been operating at L2. Due to a\ncombination of the high-precision measurement requirements of the mission and\nthe predicted proton environment at L2, the effect of non-ionizing radiation\ndamage on the detectors was early identified pre-launch as potentially imposing\na major limitation on the scientific value of the data. In this paper we\ncompare pre-flight radiation-induced Charge Transfer Inefficiency (CTI)\npredictions against in-flight measurements, focusing especially on charge\ninjection diagnostics, as well as correlating these CTI diagnostic results with\nsolar proton event data. We show that L2-directed solar activity has been\nrelatively low since launch, and radiation damage (so far) is less than\noriginally expected. Despite this, there are clear cases of correlation between\nearth-directed solar coronal mass ejection events and abrupt changes in CTI\ndiagnostics over time. These sudden jumps are lying on top of a rather constant\nincrease in CTI which we show is primarily due to the continuous bombardment of\nthe devices by high-energy Galactic Cosmic Rays. We examine the possible\nreasons for the lower than expected levels of CTI as well as examining the\neffect of controlled payload heating events on the CTI diagnostics.\nRadiation-induced CTI in the CCD serial registers and effects of ionizing\nradiation are also correspondingly lower than expected, however these topics\nare not examined here in detail.\n", "  We derive analytical expressions for the spectral moments of the dynamical\nresponse functions of the Hubbard model using the high-temperature series\nexpansion. We consider generic dimension $d$ as well as the infinite-$d$ limit,\narbitrary electron density $n$, and both finite and infinite repulsion $U$. We\nuse moment-reconstruction methods to obtain the one-electron spectral function,\nthe self-energy, and the optical conductivity. They are all smooth functions at\nhigh-temperature and, at large-$U$, they are featureless with characteristic\nwidths of order the lattice hopping parameter $t$. In the infinite-$d$ limit we\ncompare the series expansion results with accurate numerical renormalization\ngroup and interaction expansion quantum Monte-Carlo results. We find excellent\nagreement down to surprisingly low temperatures, throughout most of the\nbad-metal regime which applies for $T \\gtrsim (1-n)D$, the Brinkman-Rice scale.\nThe resistivity increases linearly in $T$ at high-temperature without\nsaturation. This results from the $1/T$ behaviour of the compressibility or\nkinetic energy, which play the role of the effective carrier number. In\ncontrast, the scattering time (or diffusion constant) saturate at high-$T$. We\nfind that $\\sigma(n,T) \\approx (1-n)\\sigma(n=0,T)$ to a very good approximation\nfor all $n$, with $\\sigma(n=0,T)\\propto t/T$ at high temperatures. The\nsaturation at small $n$ occurs due to a compensation between the\ndensity-dependence of the effective number of carriers and that of the\nscattering time. The $T$-dependence of the resistivity displays a knee-like\nfeature which signals a cross-over to the intermediate-temperature regime where\nthe diffusion constant (or scattering time) start increasing with decreasing\n$T$. At high-temperatures, the thermopower obeys the Heikes formula, while the\nWiedemann-Franz law is violated with the Lorenz number vanishing as $1/T^2$.\n", "  When an electron is forced into liquid $^3$He it forms an \"electron bubble\",\na heavy ion with radius, $R\\simeq 1.5$ nm, and mass, $M\\simeq 100\\,m_3$, where\n$m_3$ is the mass of a $^3$He atom. These negative ions have proven to be\npowerful local probes of the physical properties of the host quantum fluid,\nespecially the excitation spectra of the superfluid phases. We recently\ndeveloped a theory for Bogoliubov quasiparticles scattering off electron\nbubbles embedded in a chiral superfluid that provides a detailed understanding\nof the spectrum of Weyl Fermions bound to the negative ion, as well as a theory\nfor the forces on moving electron bubbles in superfluid $^3$He-A (Shevtsov et\nal. in arXiv:1606.06240). This theory is shown to provide quantitative\nagreement with measurements reported by the RIKEN group [Ikegami et al.,\nScience 341:59, 2013] for the drag force and anomalous Hall effect of moving\nelectron bubbles in superfluid $^3$He-A. In this report, we discuss the\nsensitivity of the forces on the moving ion to the effective interaction\nbetween normal-state quasiparticles and the ion. We consider models for the\nquasiparticle-ion (QP-ion) interaction, including the hard-sphere potential,\nconstrained random-phase-shifts, and interactions with short-range repulsion\nand intermediate range attraction. Our results show that the transverse force\nresponsible for the anomalous Hall effect is particularly sensitive to the\nstructure of the QP-ion potential, and that strong short-range repulsion,\ncaptured by the hard-sphere potential, provides an accurate model for computing\nthe forces acting on the moving electron bubble in superfluid $^3$He-A.\n", "  Substrates which are chemically or topographically patterned induce a variety\nof liquid crystal textures. The response of the liquid crystal to competing\nsurface orientations, typical of patterned substrates, is determined by the\nanisotropy of the elastic constants and the interplay of the relevant lengths\nscales, such as the correlation length and the surface geometrical parameters.\nTransitions between different textures, usually with different symmetries, may\noccur under a wide range of conditions. We use the Landau-de Gennes free energy\nto investigate the texture of nematics in sinusoidal channels with parallel\nanchoring bounded by nematic-air interfaces that favour perpendicular\n(hometropic) anchoring. In micron size channels 5CB was observed to exhibit a\nnon-trivial texture characterized by a disclination line, within the channel,\nwhich is broken into a zigzag pattern. Our calculations reveal that when the\nelastic anisotropy of the nematic does not favour twist distortions the defect\nis a straight disclination line that runs along the channel, which breaks into\na zigzag pattern with a characteristic period, when the twist elastic constant\nbecomes sufficiently small when compared to the splay and bend constants. The\ntransition occurs through a twist instability that drives the defect line to\nrotate from its original position. The interplay between the energetically\nfavourable twist distortions that induce the defect rotation and the liquid\ncrystal anchoring at the surfaces leads to the zigzag pattern. We investigate\nin detail the dependence of the periodicity of the zigzag pattern on the\ngeometrical parameters of the sinusoidal channels, which in line with the\nexperimental results is found to be non-linear.\n", "  We analyze four- and six-derivative couplings in the low energy effective\naction of $D=3$ string vacua with half-maximal supersymmetry. In analogy with\nan earlier proposal for the $(\\nabla\\Phi)^4$ coupling, we propose that the\n$\\nabla^2(\\nabla\\Phi)^4$ coupling is given exactly by a manifestly U-duality\ninvariant genus-two modular integral. In the limit where a circle in the\ninternal torus decompactifies, the $\\nabla^2(\\nabla\\Phi)^4$ coupling reduces to\nthe $D^2 F^4$ and $R^2 F^2$ couplings in $D=4$, along with an infinite series\nof corrections of order $e^{-R}$, from four-dimensional 1/4-BPS dyons whose\nwordline winds around the circle. Each of these contributions is weighted by a\nFourier coefficient of a meromorphic Siegel modular form, explaining and\nextending standard results for the BPS index of 1/4-BPS dyons.\n", "  We study an extension of the Standard Model (SM) in which two copies of the\nSM scalar $SU(2)$ doublet which do not acquire a Vacuum Expectation Value\n(VEV), and hence are \\textit{inert}, are added to the scalar sector. We allow\nfor CP-violation in the \\textit{inert} sector, where the lightest\n\\textit{inert} state is protected from decaying to SM particles through the\nconservation of a $Z_2$ symmetry. The lightest neutral particle from the\n\\textit{inert} sector, which has a mixed CP-charge due to CP-violation, is\nhence a Dark Matter (DM) candidate. We discuss the new regions of DM relic\ndensity opened up by CP-violation, and compare our results to the CP-conserving\nlimit and the Inert Doublet Model (IDM). We constrain the parameter space of\nthe CP-violating model using recent results from the Large Hadron Collider\n(LHC) and DM direct and indirect detection experiments.\n", "  Precision gauge coupling unification is one of the primary quantitative\nsuccesses of low energy or split supersymmetry. Preserving this success puts\nsevere restrictions on possible matter and gauge sectors that might appear at\ncollider-accessible energies. In this work we enumerate new gauge sectors which\nare compatible with unification, consisting of horizontal gauge groups acting\non vector-like matter charged under the Standard Model. Interestingly, almost\nall of these theories are in the supersymmetric conformal window at high\nenergies and confine quickly after the superpartners are decoupled. For a range\nof scalar masses compatible with both moderately tuned and minimally split\nsupersymmetry, the confining dynamics happen at the multi-TeV scale, leading to\na spectrum of multiple spin-0 and spin-1 resonances accessible to the LHC, with\nunusual quantum numbers and striking decay patterns.\n", "  The structural properties of LaCu$_{6-x}$Au$_x$ have been studied using\nneutron diffraction, x-ray diffraction, and heat capacity measurements. The\ncontinuous orthorhombic-monoclinic structural phase transition in LaCu$_{6}$ is\nsuppressed linearly with Au substitution until a complete suppression of the\nstructural phase transition occurs at the critical composition, $x_{c}$ = 0.3.\nHeat capacity measurements at low temperatures indicate residual structural\ninstability at $x_c$ that extends well into the orthorhombic phase. The\ninstability is ferroelastic in nature, with density functional theory (DFT)\ncalculations showing negligible coupling to electronic states near the Fermi\nlevel. The data and calculations presented here are consistent with the zero\ntemperature termination of a continuous structural phase transition suggesting\nthat the LaCu$_{6-x}$Au$_x$ series hosts an elastic quantum critical point.\n", "  We employ electrostatic conversion drift calculations to match CCD pixel\nsignal covariances observed in flat field exposures acquired using candidate\nsensor devices for the LSST Camera. We thus constrain pixel geometry\ndistortions present at the end of integration, based on signal images recorded.\nWe use available data from several operational voltage parameter settings to\nvalidate our understanding. Our primary goal is to optimize flux point-spread\nfunction (FPSF) estimation quantitatively, and thereby minimize sensor-induced\nerrors which may limit performance in precision astronomy applications. We\nconsider alternative compensation scenarios that will take maximum advantage of\nour understanding of this underlying mechanism in data processing pipelines\ncurrently under development.\n  To quantitatively capture the pixel response in high-contrast/high dynamic\nrange operational extrema, we propose herein some straightforward laboratory\ntests that involve altering the time order of source illumination on sensors,\nwithin individual test exposures. Hence the word {\\it hysteretic} in the title\nof this paper.\n", "  In light of the Higgs boson discovery we reconsider generation of the baryon\nasymmetry in the non-minimal split Supersymmetry model with an additional\nsinglet superfield in the Higgs sector. We find that successful baryogenesis\nduring the first order electroweak phase transition is possible within\nphenomenologically viable part of the model parameter space. We discuss several\nphenomenological consequences of this scenario, namely, predictions for the\nelectric dipole moments of electron and neutron and collider signatures of\nlight charginos and neutralinos.\n", "  Recently, a first step was made by the authors towards a systematic\ninvestigation of the effect of reaction-step-size noise - uncertainty in the\nstep size of the reaction - on the dynamics of stochastic populations. This was\ndone by investigating the effect of bursty influx on the switching dynamics of\nstochastic populations. Here we extend this formalism to account for bursty\nreproduction processes, and improve the accuracy of the formalism to include\nsubleading-order corrections. Bursty reproduction appears in various contexts,\nwhere notable examples include bursty viral production from infected cells, and\nreproduction of mammals involving varying number of offspring. The main\nquestion we quantitatively address is how bursty reproduction affects the\noverall fate of the population. We consider two complementary scenarios:\npopulation extinction and population survival; in the former a population gets\nextinct after maintaining a long-lived metastable state, whereas in the latter\na population proliferates despite undergoing a deterministic drift towards\nextinction. In both models reproduction occurs in bursts, sampled from an\narbitrary distribution. In the extinction problem, we show that bursty\nreproduction broadens the quasi-stationary distribution of population sizes in\nthe metastable state, which results in an exponential decrease of the mean time\nto extinction. In the survival problem, bursty reproduction yields an\nexponential increase in survival probability of the population. Close to the\nbifurcation limit our analytical results simplify considerably and are shown to\ndepend solely on the mean and variance of the burst-size distribution. Our\nformalism is demonstrated on several realistic distributions which all compare\nwell with numerical Monte-Carlo simulations.\n", "  We consider Sturm-Liouville operators with measure-valued weight and\npotential, and positive, bounded diffusion coefficient which is bounded away\nfrom zero. By means of a local periodicity condition, which can be seen as a\nquantitative Gordon condition, we prove a bound on eigenvalues for the\ncorresponding operator in $L_p$, for $1\\leq p<\\infty$. We also explain the\nsharpness of our quantitative bound, and provide an example for quasiperiodic\noperators.\n", "  Under the conditions of superfluid-Mott-insulator criticality in two\ndimensions, the trapping centers--i.e., local potential wells and bumps--are\ngenerically characterized by an integer charge corresponding to the number of\ntrapped particles (if positive) or holes (if negative). Varying the strength of\nthe center leads to a transition between two competing ground states with\ncharges differing by $\\pm 1$. The hallmark of the transition scenario is a\nsplitting of the number density distortion, $\\delta n(r)$, into a half-integer\ncore and a large halo carrying the complementary charge of $\\pm 1/2$. The sign\nof the halo changes across the transition and the radius of the halo, $r_0$,\ndiverges on the approach to the critical strength of the center, $V = V_c$, by\nthe law $r_0 \\propto |V-V_c|^{-\\tilde{\\nu}}$, with $\\tilde{\\nu} \\approx\n2.33(5)$.\n", "  We perform a systematic one-loop renormalization of a general renormalizable\nYang-Mills theory coupled to scalars and fermions using a regularization scheme\nwith a smooth momentum cutoff $\\Lambda$ (implemented through an exponential\ndamping factor). We construct the necessary finite counterterms restoring the\nBRST invariance of the effective action by analyzing the relevant\nSlavnov-Taylor identities. We find the relation between the renormalized\nparameters in our scheme and in the conventional $\\overline{\\rm MS}$ scheme\nwhich allow us to obtain the explicit two-loop renormalization group equations\nin our scheme from the known two-loop ones in the $\\overline{\\rm MS}$ scheme.\nWe calculate in our scheme the divergences of two-loop vacuum graphs in the\npresence of a constant scalar background field which allow us to rederive the\ntwo-loop beta functions for parameters of the scalar potential. We also prove\nthat consistent application of the proposed regularization leads to\ncounterterms which, together with the original action, combine to a bare action\nexpressed in terms of bare parameters. This, together with treating $\\Lambda$\nas an intrinsic scale of a hypothetical underlying finite theory of all\ninteractions, offers a possibility of an unconventional solution to the\nhierarchy problem if no intermediate scales between the electroweak scale and\nthe Planck scale exist.\n", "  In this paper we use the recently suggested conjecture about the integral\nrepresentation for the flat coordinates on Frobenius manifolds, connected with\nthe isolated singularities, to compute the flat coordinates and Saito primitive\nform on the space of the deformations of Gepner chiral ring\n$\\widehat{SU}(3)_4$. We verify this conjecture comparing the expressions for\nthe flat coordinates obtained from the conjecture with the one found by direct\ncomputation. The considered case is of a particular interest since together\nwith the relevant and marginal deformations it has one irrelevant deformation.\n", "  The topological order of single-crystal Bi and its surface states on the\n(111) surface are studied in detail based on empirical tight-binding (TB)\ncalculations. New TB parameters are presented that are used to calculate the\nsurface states of semi-infinite single-crystal Bi(111), which agree with the\nexperimental angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy results. The influence\nof the crystal lattice distortion is surveyed and a topological phase\ntransition is found that is driven by in-plane expansion. In contrast with the\nsemi-infinite system, the surface-state dispersions on finite-thickness slabs\nare non-trivial irrespective of the bulk topological order. The role of the\ninteraction between the top and bottom surfaces in the slab is systematically\nstudied, and it is revealed that a very thick slab is required to properly\nobtain the bulk topological order of Bi from the (111) surface state: above 150\nbiatomic layers in this case.\n", "  In this paper we consider an interaction between the air core modes of hollow\ncore waveguide microstructures and core cladding boundary walls in various\nshapes. The analysis is based on well established models such as the\nanti-resonant reflecting optical waveguide model and on the models proposed for\nthe first time. In particular, we consider the dynamics of light localization\nin the polygonalcore cladding boundary wall as dependant on the type of its\ndiscrete rotational symmetry. Based on our findings we analyze the mechanisms\nof light localization in the core cladding boundary walls of negative curvature\nhollow core microstructured fibers.\n", "  We consider the possibility of an interaction in the dark sector in the\npresence of massive neutrinos, and study the observational constraints on three\ndifferent scenarios of massive neutrinos using the most recent CMB anisotropy\ndata in combination with type Ia supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations, and\nHubble parameter measurements. When a sterile neutrino is introduced in the\ninteracting dark sector scenario in addition to the standard model prediction\nof neutrinos, we find that the coupling parameter, characterizing the\ninteraction between dark matter and dark energy, is non-zero at 2$\\sigma$\nconfidence level. The interaction model with sterile neutrino is also found to\nbe a promising one to alleviate the current tension on Hubble constant. We do\nnot find the evidence for a coupling in the dark sector when the possibility of\na sterile neutrino is discarded.\n", "  We study the production of scalar leptoquarks at IceCube, in particular, a\nparticle transforming as a triplet under the weak interaction. The existence of\nelectroweak-triplet scalars is highly motivated by models of grand unification\nand also within radiative seesaw models for neutrino mass generation. In our\nframework, we extend the Standard Model by a single colored electroweak-triplet\nscalar leptoquark and analyze its implications on the excess of ultra-high\nenergy neutrino events observed by the IceCube collaboration. We consider only\ncouplings between the leptoquark to first generation leptons and quarks and\ncarry out a statistical analysis to determine the parameters that best describe\nthe IceCube data as well as set $95\\%$ CL upper bounds. We analyze whether this\nstudy is still consistent with most up-to-date LHC data and various low energy\nobservables.\n", "  We investigate the nature of the ordering among magnetic adatoms, randomly\ndeposited on the surface of topological insulators. Restricting ourselves to\ndilute impurity and weak coupling (between itinerant fermion and magnetic\nimpurities) limit, we show that for arbitrary amount of chemical doping away\nfrom the apex of the surface Dirac cone the magnetic impurities tend to arrange\nthemselves in a spin-density-wave pattern, with the periodicity approximately\n$\\pi/k_F$, where $k_F$ is the Fermi wave vector, when magnetic moment for\nimpurity adatoms is isotropic. However, when magnetic moment possesses strong\nIsing or easy-axis anisotropy, pursuing both analytical and numerical\napproaches we show that the ground state is ferromagnetic for low to moderate\nchemical doping, despite the fragmentation of the system into multiple\nferromagnetic islands. For high doping away from the Dirac point as well, the\nsystem appears to fragment into many ferromagnetic islands, but the\nmagnetization in these islands is randomly distributed. Such magnetic ordering\nwith net zero magnetization, is referred here as ferromagnetic spin glass,\nwhich is separated from the pure ferromagnet state by a first order phase\ntransition. We generalize our analysis for cubic topological insulators\n(supporting three Dirac cones on a surface) and demonstrate that the nature of\nmagnetic orderings and the transition between them remains qualitatively the\nsame. We also discuss the possible relevance of our analysis to recent\nexperiments.\n", "  We consider the zero-temperature van der Waals interaction between two\nmolecules, each of which has a zero or near-zero electronic gap between a\ngroundstate and the first excited state, using a toy model molecule (\nequilateral H3) as an example. We show that the van der Waals energy between\ntwo groundstate molecules falls off as D^(-3) instead of the usual D^(-6)\ndependence, when the molecules are separated by distance D: We show that this\nis caused by perfect \"spooky\" correlation between the two fluctuating electric\ndipoles. The phenomenon is related to, but not the same as, the \"resonant\"\ninteraction between an electronically excited and a groundstate molecule\nintroduced by Eisenschitz and London in 1930. It is also an example of \"type C\nvan der Waals non- additivity\" recently introduced by one of us ( Int. J.\nQuantum Chem. 114, 1157 (2014)). Our toy molecule H3 is not stable, but\nsymmetry considerations suggest that a similar vdW phenomenon may be\nobservable, despite Jahn-Teller effects, in molecules with discrete rotational\nsymmetry and broken inversion symmetry, such as certain metal atom clusters.\nThe motion of the nuclei will need to be included for a definitive analysis of\nsuch cases, however.\n", "  We describe how the main neutrino interaction generators (GENIE, NEUT and\nNuWro) used by current neutrino oscillation experiments treat the shallow and\ndeep inelastic region. We then compare their predictions for charged current\nevents in this region, in terms of transferred momentum as well as\nmultiplicities for different types of hadrons. We present additional\ncomparisons in the low hadronic invariant mass region, where the generators use\ndifferent custom models.\n", "  We study the ground-state phase diagram of a Heisenberg model with spin\n$S=\\frac{1}{2}$ on a diamond-like decorated square lattice. A diamond unit has\ntwo types of antiferromagnetic exchange interactions, and the ratio $\\lambda$\nbetween the length of the diagonal bond and that of the other four edges\ndetermines the strength of frustration. It has been pointed out [J. Phys. Soc.\nJpn {\\bf85}, 033705 (2016)] that the so-called tetramer-dimer states, which are\nexpected to be stabilized in an intermediate region of $\\lambda_{\\rm\nc}<\\lambda<2$, are identical to the square-lattice dimer covering states, which\nignited renewed interest in high-dimensional diamond-like decorated lattices.\nIn order to determine the phase boundary $\\lambda_{\\rm c}$, we employ the\nmodified spin wave method to estimate the energy of the ferrimagnetic state and\nobtain $\\lambda_{\\rm c}=0.974$. Our obtained magnetizations for\nspin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ sites and for spin-1 sites are $m=0.398$ and\n$\\tilde{m}=0.949$, and spin reductions are 20 \\% and 5\\%, respectively. This\nindicates that spin fluctuation is much smaller than that of the\n$S=\\frac{1}{2}$ square-lattice antiferromagnet: thus, we can consider that our\nobtained ground-state energy is highly accurate. Further, our numerical\ndiagonalization study suggests that other cluster states do not appear in the\nground-state phase diagram.\n", "  We report on the experimental observation of vortex cluster shedding from a\nmoving obstacle in an oblate atomic Bose-Einstein condensate. At low obstacle\nvelocities $v$ above a critical value, vortex clusters consisting of two\nlike-sign vortices are generated to form a regular configuration like a von\nK\\'arm\\'an street, and as $v$ is increased, the shedding pattern becomes\nirregular with many different kinds of vortex clusters. In particular, we\nobserve that the Stouhal number associated with the shedding frequency exhibits\nsaturation behavior with increasing $v$. The regular-to-turbulent transition of\nthe vortex cluster shedding reveals remarkable similarities between a\nsuperfluid and a classical viscous fluid. Our work opens a new direction for\nexperimental investigations of the superfluid Reynolds number characterizing\nuniversal superfluid hydrodynamics.\n", "  On 2015 June 15 the Swift space observatory discovered that the Galactic\nblack hole candidate V404 Cyg was undergoing another active X-ray phase, after\n25 years of inactivity (Barthelmy et al. 2015). Twelve telescopes of the MASTER\nGlobal Robotic Net located at six sites across four continents were the first\nground based observatories to start optical monitoring of the microquasar after\nits gamma-ray wakeup at 18h 34m 09s U.T. on 2015 June 15 (Lipunov et al. 2015).\nIn this paper we report, for the first time, the discovery of variable optical\nlinear polarization, changing by 4-6% over a timescale of approximately 1 h, on\ntwo different epochs. We can conclude that the additional variable polarization\narisies from the relativistic jet generated by the black hole in V404Cyg. The\npolarization variability correlates with optical brightness changes, increasing\nwhen the flux decreases.\n", "  We describe a parallel pair of high voltage electric field plates designed\nand constructed to minimise magnetic Johnson noise. They are formed by\nlaminating glass substrates with commercially available polyimide (Kapton)\ntape, covered with a thin gold film. Tested in vacuum, the outgassing rate is\nless than $5\\times10^{-5}$ mbar.l/s. The plates have been operated at electric\nfields up to 8.3 kV/cm, when the leakage current is at most a few hundred pA.\nThe design is discussed in the context of a molecular spin precession\nexperiment to measure the permanent electric dipole moment of the electron.\n", "  As a counterpart to our previous study of the stationary distribution formed\nby sums of positions at the Feigenbaum point via the period-doubling cascade in\nthe logistic map (Eur. Phys. J. B 87 32, (2014)), we determine the family of\nrelated distributions for the accompanying cascade of chaotic band-splitting\npoints in the same system. By doing this we rationalize how the interplay of\nregular and chaotic dynamics gives rise to either multiscale or gaussian limit\ndistributions. As demonstrated before (J. Stat. Mech. P01001 (2010)), sums of\ntrajectory positions associated with the chaotic-band attractors of the\nlogistic map lead only to a gaussian limit distribution, but, as we show here,\nthe features of the stationary multiscale distribution at the Feigenbaum point\ncan be observed in the distributions obtained from finite sums with\nsufficiently small number of terms. The multiscale features are acquired from\nthe repellor preimage structure that dominates the dynamics toward the chaotic\nattractors. When the number of chaotic bands increases this hierarchical\nstructure with multiscale and discrete scale-invariant properties develops.\nAlso, we suggest that the occurrence of truncated q-gaussian-shaped\ndistributions for specially prescribed sums are t-Student distributions\npremonitory of the gaussian limit distribution.\n", "  In this work, we investigate production of Drell-Yan (DY) pairs in\nproton-nucleus collisions in kinematic regions where the corresponding\ncoherence length does not exceed the nuclear radius, $R_A$, and the quantum\ncoherence effects should be treated with a special care. The results for the\nnucleus-to-nucleon production ratio available in the literature so far are\nusually based on the assumption of a very long coherence length (LCL) $l_c\\gg\nR_A$. Since the onset of coherence effects is controlled by the coherence\nlength $l_c$, we estimated its magnitude in various kinematic regions of the DY\nprocess and found that the LCL approximation should not be used at small and\nmedium c.m. collision energies ($\\sqrt{s} \\lesssim 200$ GeV) as well as at\nlarge dilepton invariant masses. In order to obtain realistic predictions, we\ncomputed for the first time the DY cross section using the generalised color\ndipole approach based on the rigorous Green function formalism, which naturally\nincorporates the color transparency and quantum coherence effects and hence\nallows to estimate the nuclear shadowing with no restrictions on the CL. In\naddition to the shadowing effect, we studied a complementary effect of initial\nstate interactions (ISI) that causes an additional suppression at large values\nof the Feynman variable. Numerical results for the nuclear modification factor\naccounting for the ISI effect and the finite $l_c$ are compared to the data\navailable from the fixed-target FNAL measurements and a good agreement has been\nfound. Besides, we present new predictions for the nuclear suppression as a\nfunction of dilepton rapidity and invariant mass in the kinematic regions that\ncan be probed by the RHIC collider as well as by the planned AFTER@LHC and LHCb\nfixed-target experiments.\n", "  The crystal structures and magnetic properties of three previously unreported\nA2B2F7 pyrochlore materials, NaSrMn2F7, NaCaFe2F7, and NaSrFe2F7 are presented.\nIn these compounds, either S=2 Fe2+ or S=5/2 Mn2+ is on the B site, while\nnonmagnetic Na and Ca (Na and Sr) are disordered on the A site. The materials,\nwhich were grown as crystals via the floating zone method, display high\neffective magnetic moments and large Curie-Weiss thetas. Despite these\ncharacteristics, freezing of the magnetic spins, characterized by peaks in the\nsusceptibility or specific heat, is not observed until low temperatures. The\nempirical frustration index, f=- {\\theta}cw/Tf, for the materials are 36\n(NaSrMn2F7), 27 (NaSrFe2F7), and 19 (NaCaFe2F7). AC susceptibility, DC\nsusceptibility, and heat capacity measurements are used to characterize the\nobserved spin glass behavior. The results suggest that the compounds are\nfrustrated pyrochlore antiferromagnets with weak bond disorder. The magnetic\nphenomena that these fluoride pyrochlores exhibit, in addition to their\navailability as relatively large single crystals, make them promising\ncandidates for the study of geometric magnetic frustration.\n", "  Ultra-long gamma-ray bursts (ulGRBs) are a new population of GRBs with\nextreme durations of $\\sim 10^{4}$ s. Leading candidates for their origin are\nblue supergiant collapsars, magnetars, and white dwarf tidal disruption events\n(WD-TDEs) caused by massive black holes (BHs). Recent observations of\nsupernova-like (SN-like) bumps associated with ulGRBs challenged both the\nWD-TDE and the blue supergiant models because of the detection of SNe and the\nabsence of hydrogen lines, respectively. We propose that WD-TDEs can\naccommodate the observed SN-like bumps if the fallback WD matter releases\nenergy into the unbound WD ejecta. The observed ejecta energy, luminosity, and\nvelocity are explained by the gravitational energy, Eddington luminosity, and\nescape velocity of the formed accretion disk, respectively. We also show that\nthe observed X-rays can ionize the ejecta, eliminating lines. The SN-like light\ncurves (SN 2011kl) for the ulGRB 111209A are consistent with all three models,\nalthough a magnetar model is unnatural because the spin-down time required to\npower the SN-like bump is a hundred times longer than the GRB. Our results\nimply that TDEs are a possible energy source for SN-like events in general and\nfor ulGRBs in particular.\n", "  In this paper we develop a microscopic analysis of the light scattering on a\nperiodic two-level atomic array coupled to an optical nanofiber. We extend the\nscattering matrix approach for two-level system interaction with nanofiber\nfundamental waveguiding mode HE_{11}, that allows us modeling the scattering\nspectra. We support these results considering the dispersion of the polaritonic\nstates formed by the superposition of the fundamental mode of light HE_{11} and\nthe atomic chain states. To illustrate our approach we start with considering a\nsimple model of light scattering over atomic array in the free space. We\ndiscuss the Bragg diffraction at the atomic array and show that the scattering\nspectrum is defined by the non-symmetric coupling of two-level system with\nnanofiber and vacuum modes. The proposed method allows considering two-level\nsystems interaction with full account for dipole-dipole interaction both via\nnear fields and long-range interaction owing to nanofiber mode coupling.\n", "  We propose a connected prescription formula in twistor space for all\ntree-level form factors of the stress tensor multiplet operator in\n$\\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills, which is a generalisation of the expression\nof Roiban, Spradlin and Volovich for superamplitudes. By introducing link\nvariables, we show that our formula is identical to the recently proposed\nfour-dimensional scattering equations for form factors. Similarly to the case\nof amplitudes, the link representation of form factors is shown to be directly\nrelated to BCFW recursion relations, and is considerably more tractable than\nthe scattering equations. We also discuss how our results are related to a\nrecent Grassmannian formulation of form factors, and comment on a possible\nderivation of our formula from ambitwistor strings.\n", "  We propose to use multiphoton interferences of photons emitted from\nstatistically independent thermal light sources in combination with linear\noptical detection techniques to reconstruct, i.e., image, arbitrary source\ngeometries in one dimension with subclassical resolution. The scheme is an\nextension of earlier work [Phys. Rev. Lett. 109, 233603 (2012)] where N\nregularly spaced sources in one dimension were imaged by use of the Nth-order\nintensity correlation function. Here, we generalize the scheme to reconstruct\nany number of independent thermal light sources at arbitrary separations in one\ndimension exploiting intensity correlation functions of order $m \\geq 3$. We\npresent experimental results confirming the imaging protocol and provide a\nrigorous mathematical proof for the obtained subclassical resolution.\n", "  \"Subthreshold pions\" and so-called \"hard photons\" are two important channels\nfor producing less than 1 GeV $\\gamma$-rays and $e^\\pm$ pairs from nuclear\ncollisions with energy per nucleon below the $\\pi$-meson production threshold.\nI use publicly available experimental data to parametrize these two channels'\n$\\gamma$-ray and $e^\\pm$ production cross sections and extend the pion\ncontribution to these particles spectra at higher energies using their\ncorresponding spectra from $pp$ interactions. These parametrizations are valid\nfor collision energy $T_p\\leq 100$ A GeV and agree reasonably well with the\navailable experimental data. The new parametrizations allow, for the first\ntime, accurate studies of astrophysical $\\gamma$-rays below 1 GeV.\n", "  Geodesic acoustic modes (GAMs) are oscillations of the electric field whose\nimportance in tokamak plasmas is due to their role in the regulation of\nturbulence. The linear collisionless damping of GAMs is investigated here by\nmeans of analytical theory and numerical simulations with the global\ngyrokinetic particle-in-cell code ORB5. The combined effect of the phase mixing\nand Landau damping is found to quickly redistribute the GAM energy in\nphase-space, due to the synergy of the finite orbit width of the passing ions\nand the cascade in wave number given by the phase mixing. When plasma\nparameters characteristic of realistic tokamak profiles are considered, the GAM\ndecay time is found to be an order of magnitude lower than the decay due to the\nLandau damping alone, and in some cases of the same order of magnitude of the\ncharacteristic GAM drive time due to the nonlinear interaction with an ITG\nmode. In particular, the radial mode structure evolution in time is\ninvestigated here and reproduced quantitatively by means of a dedicated initial\nvalue code and diagnostics.\n", "  The effects of an external time-dependent magnetic field in the conversion\nprobability of photon-to-axion-like particles are studied. Our findings show\nthat for a certain time regime, the amplitude of the produced axion-like field\ncan be enlarged with respect to the static case, thus, enhancing the\nprobability of conversion.\n", "  Recent R-matrix calculations claim to produce a significant enhancement in\nthe opacity of Fe XVII due to atomic core excitations [S. N. Nahar & A.K.\nPradhan, Phys. Rev. Letters 116, 235003 (2016), arXiv:1606.02731] and assert\nthat this enhancement is consistent with recent measurements of\nhigher-than-predicted iron opacities [J. E. Bailey et al., Nature 517, 56\n(2015)]. This comment shows that the standard opacity models which have already\nbeen directly compared with experimental data produce photon absorption\ncross-sections for Fe XVII that are effectively equivalent to (and in fact\nlarger than) the new R-matrix opacities. Thus, the new R-matrix results cannot\nbe expected to significantly impact the existing discrepancies between theory\nand experiment because they produce neither a \"large enhancement\" nor account\nfor \"missing continuum plasma opacity\" relative to standard models.\n", "  Vircators (Virtual Cathode Oscillators) are sources of short-pulsed, high\npower, microwave (GHz) radiation. An essentially dimensional argument relates\ntheir radiated power, pulse energy and oscillation frequency to their driving\nvoltage and fundamental physical constants. For a diode of width and gap 10 cm\nand for voltages of a few hundred keV the peak radiated power cannot exceed\n${\\cal O} (\\text{30 GW})$ and the broad-band single cycle radiated energy\ncannot exceed ${\\cal O}(\\text{3 J})$. If electrons can be accelerated to\nrelativistic energies higher powers and radiated energies may be possible.\n", "  A partially gapped spectrum due to the application of a magnetic field is one\nof the main probes of Rashba spin-orbit coupling in nanowires. Such a \"helical\ngap\" manifests itself in the linear conductance, as well as in dynamic response\nfunctions such as the spectral function, the structure factor, or the\ntunnelling density of states. In this paper, we investigate theoretically the\nsignature of the helical gap in these observables with a particular focus on\nthe interplay between Rashba spin-orbit coupling and electron-electron\ninteractions. We show that in a quasi-one-dimensional wire, interactions can\nopen a helical gap even without magnetic field. We calculate the dynamic\nresponse functions using bosonization, a renormalization group analysis, and\nthe exact form factors of the emerging sine-Gordon model. For special\ninteraction strengths, we verify our results by refermionization. We show how\nthe two types of helical gaps, caused by magnetic fields or interactions, can\nbe distinguished in experiments.\n", "  We present a scheme for the generation of central exclusive final states in\nthe Pythia 8 program. The implementation allows for the investigation of higher\norder corrections to such exclusive processes as approximated by the\ninitial-state parton shower in Pythia 8. To achieve this, the spin and colour\ndecomposition of the initial-state shower has been worked out, in order to\ndetermine the probability that a partonic state generated from an inclusive\nsub-process followed by a series of initial-state parton splittings can be\nconsidered as an approximation of an exclusive colour- and spin-singlet\nprocess. We use our implementation to investigate effects of parton showers on\nsome examples of central exclusive processes, and find sizeable effects on\ndi-jet production, while the effects on e.g. central exclusive Higgs production\nare minor.\n", "  Employing the $G_0W_0$ approximation of Hedin's $GW$ approach one can obtain\nquasi-particle energies of extended systems and molecules with good accuracy.\nHowever, for many materials, semi-local exchange-correlation functionals are\nunsatisfactory starting points for $G_0W_0$ calculations. Hybrid functionals\noften improve upon them, but at a substantially higher computational cost. As\nan alternative, we suggest the LDA-1/2 method, which provides reasonable band\ngaps, without being computationally involved. In this work, we systematically\ncompare 3 starting points for $G_0W_0$: LDA, PBE0, and LDA-1/2. A selection of\nsolids is chosen for this benchmark: C, Si, SiC, AlP, LiF, MgO, Ne, Ar, GaN,\nGaAs, CdS, ZnS, and ZnO. We demonstrate that LDA-1/2 is a good starting point\nin most cases, reducing the mean absolute error of band gaps by 50% when\ncompared to the other 2 functionals.\n", "  Nonradiative exciton lifetime in silicon is determined by comparison of the\nexperimental and theoretical curves of bulk minority charge carriers lifetime\non doping and excitation levels. This value is used to analyze the influence of\nexcitonic effects on internal luminescence quantum yield at room temperature,\ntaking into account both nonradiative and radiative exciton lifetimes. A range\nof Shockley-Hall-Reed lifetimes is found, where excitonic effects lead to an\nincrease of internal luminescence quantum yield.\n", "  Crustal cooling of accretion-heated neutron stars provides insight into the\nstellar interior of neutron stars. The neutron star X-ray transient,\nKS~1731$-$260, was in outburst for 12.5 years before returning to quiescence in\n2001. We have monitored the cooling of this source since then through {\\it\nChandra} and {\\it XMM-Newton} observations. Here, we present a 150 ks {\\it\nChandra} observation of KS~1731$-$260 taken in August 2015, about 14.5 years\ninto quiescence, and 6 years after the previous observation. We find that the\nneutron star surface temperature is consistent with the previous observation,\nsuggesting that crustal cooling has likely stopped and the crust has reached\nthermal equilibrium with the core. Using a theoretical crust thermal evolution\ncode, we fit the observed cooling curves and constrain the core temperature\n(T$_c = 9.35\\pm0.25\\times10^7$ K), composition (Q$_{imp} = 4.4^{+2.2}_{-0.5}$)\nand level of extra shallow heating required (Q$_{sh} = 1.36\\pm0.18$\nMeV/nucleon). We find that the presence of a low thermal conductivity layer, as\nexpected from nuclear pasta, is not required to fit the cooling curve well, but\ncannot be excluded either.\n", "  The assumption of a spatially uniform helium distribution in the intracluster\nmedium can lead to biases in the estimates of key cluster parameters if\ncomposition gradients are present. The helium concentration profile in galaxy\nclusters is unfortunately not directly observable. Current models addressing\nthe putative sedimentation are one-dimensional and parametrize the presence of\nmagnetic fields in a crude way, ignoring the weakly-collisional, magnetized\nnature of the medium. When these effects are considered, a wide variety of\ninstabilities can play an important role in the plasma dynamics. In a series of\nrecent papers, we have developed the local, linear theory of these\ninstabilities and addressed their non-linear development with a modified\nversion of Athena. Here, we extend our study by developing a quasi-global\napproach that we use to simulate the mixing of helium as induced by\ngeneralizations of the heat-flux-driven buoyancy instability (HBI) and the\nmagneto-thermal instability (MTI), which feed off thermal and composition\ngradients. In the inner region of the ICM, mixing can occur on few Gyrs, after\nwhich the average magnetic field inclination angle is $\\sim 45^{\\circ}$\nresulting in an averaged Spitzer parameter higher by about 20 % than the value\nobtained in homogeneous simulations. In the cluster outskirts the instabilities\nare rather inefficient, due to the shallow gradients. This suggests that\ncompositions gradients in cluster cores might be shallower than one-dimensional\nmodels predict. More quantitative statements demand more refined models that\ncan incorporate the physics driving the sedimentation process and\nsimultaneously account for the weakly-collisional nature of the plasma.\n", "  Linearity is an important and frequently sought property in electronics and\ninstrumentation. Here, we report a method capable of, given a transfer\nfunction, identifying the respective most linear region of operation with a\nfixed width. This methodology, which is based on least squares regression and\nsystematic consideration of all possible regions, has been illustrated with\nrespect to both an analytical (sigmoid transfer function) and real-world\n(low-power, one-stage class A transistor amplifier) situations. In the former\ncase, the method was found to identity the theoretically optimal region of\noperation even in presence of noise. In the latter case, it was possible to\nidentify an amplifier circuit configuration providing a good compromise between\nlinearity, amplification and output resistance. The transistor amplifier\napplication, which was addressed in terms of transfer functions derived from\nits experimentally obtained characteristic surface, also yielded contributions\nsuch as the estimation of local constants of the device, as opposed to\ntypically considered average values. Moreover, the obtained characteristic\nsurfaces of the considered transistor (a generic, low signal device) revealed a\nsurprisingly complex structure. The reported method and results paves the way\nto several other applications in other types of devices and systems,\nintelligent control operation, and other areas such as identifying regions of\npower law behavior.\n", "  Readily synthesizable nano-graphene and poly ethylene glycol based stable\ngels have been synthesized employing an easy refluxing method and exhaustive\nrheological and viscoelastic characterizations have been performed to\nunderstand the nature of such complex gel systems. The gels exhibit shear\nthinning response with pronounced yield stress values which is indicative of a\nmicrostructure where the graphene nanoflakes intercalate with the polymer\nchains and form a pseudo spring damper network. Experimentations on the\nthixotropic behavior of the gels indicate that the presence of the G nanoflakes\nleads to immensely augmented structural stability capable of withstanding\nsevere impact shears. Further information about the localized interactions of\nthe G nanoflakes with the polymer chains is revealed from the amplitude and\nfrequency sweep analyses in both linear and nonlinear viscoelastic regimes.\nMassively enhanced cross over amplitude values are recorded and several smart\neffects such as enhanced elastic behavior at increasing forcing frequencies are\nregistered. Structural resonance induced disruption of the elastic behavior is\nobserved for the gels for a given range of frequency and the proposition of\nresonance has been justified mathematically. It is observed that post this\nresonance bandwidth, the gels are able to self-heal and regain their original\nelastic behavior back without any external intervention. More detailed\ninformation on the viscoelastic nature of the gels has been obtained from creep\nand recovery compliance tests and justifications for the spring damper\nmicrostructure has been obtained. Smart features such as enhanced stress\nrelaxation behavior with increasing strain have been observed and the same\nexplained based on the proposed microstructure.\n", "  Combining Pati-Salam (PS) and flavour symmetries in a renormalisable setup,\nwe devise a scenario which produces realistic masses for the charged leptons.\nFlavour-symmetry breaking scalar fields in the adjoint representations of the\nPS gauge group are responsible for generating different flavour structures for\nup- and down-type quarks as well as for leptons. The model is characterised by\nnew heavy fermions which mix with the Standard Model quarks and leptons. In\nparticular, the partners for the third fermion generation induce sizeable\nsources of flavour violation. Focusing on the charged-lepton sector, we\nscrutinise the model with respect to its implications for lepton-flavour\nviolating processes such as $\\mu \\rightarrow e\\gamma$, $\\mu\\rightarrow 3e$ and\nmuon conversion in nuclei.\n", "  The electric quadrupole moment of the 33Al20 ground state, located at the\nborder of the island of inversion, was obtained using continuous-beam\nbeta-detected nuclear quadrupole resonance (beta-NQR). From the measured\nquadrupole coupling constant Q = 2.31(4) MHz in an alpha-Al2O3 crystal, a\nprecise value for the electric quadrupole moment is extracted: Qs= 141(3) mb. A\ncomparison with large-scale shell model calculations shows that 33Al has at\nleast 50% intruder configurations in the ground state wave function, favoring\nthe excitation of two neutrons across the N = 20 shell gap. 33Al therefore\nclearly marks the gradual transition north of the deformed Na and Mg nuclei\ntowards the normal Z>14 isotopes.\n", "  We consider discrete time Brownian ratchet models: Parrondo's games. Using\nthe Fourier transform, we calculate the exact probability distribution\nfunctions for both the capital dependent and history dependent Parrondo's\ngames. We find that in some cases there are oscillations near the maximum of\nthe probability distribution, and after many rounds there are two limiting\ndistributions, for the odd and even total number of rounds of gambling. We\nassume that the solution of the aforementioned models can be applied to\nportfolio optimization.\n", "  $^{75}$As, $^{87}$Rb and $^{85}$Rb nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) and\n$^{87}$Rb nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements in RbFe$_2$As$_2$\niron-based superconductor are presented. We observe a marked broadening of\n$^{75}$As NQR spectrum below $T_0\\simeq 140$ K which is associated with the\nonset of a charge order in the FeAs planes. Below $T_0$ we observe a power-law\ndecrease in $^{75}$As nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate down to $T^*\\simeq\n20$ K. Below that temperature the nuclei start to probe different dynamics\nowing to the different local electronic configurations induced by the charge\norder. A fraction of the nuclei probes spin dynamics associated with electrons\napproaching a localization while another fraction probes activated dynamics\npossibly associated with a pseudogap. These different trends are discussed in\nthe light of an orbital selective behaviour expected for the electronic\ncorrelations.\n", "  Discrete flow mapping was recently introduced as an efficient ray based\nmethod determining wave energy distributions in complex built up structures.\nWave energy densities are transported along ray trajectories through polygonal\nmesh elements using a finite dimensional approximation of a ray transfer\noperator. In this way the method can be viewed as a smoothed ray tracing method\ndefined over meshed surfaces. Many applications require the resolution of wave\nenergy distributions in three-dimensional domains, such as in room acoustics,\nunderwater acoustics and for electromagnetic cavity problems. In this work we\nextend discrete flow mapping to three-dimensional domains by propagating wave\nenergy densities through tetrahedral meshes. The geometric simplicity of the\ntetrahedral mesh elements is utilised to efficiently compute the ray transfer\noperator using a mixture of analytic and spectrally accurate numerical\nintegration. The important issue of how to choose a suitable basis\napproximation in phase space whilst maintaining a reasonable computational cost\nis addressed via low order local approximations on tetrahedral faces in the\nposition coordinate and high order orthogonal polynomial expansions in momentum\nspace.\n", "  The issue of electroweak vacuum stability is studied in presence of a scalar\nfield which participates in modifying the minimal chaotic inflation model. It\nis shown that the threshold effect on the Higgs quartic coupling originating\nfrom the Higgs-inflaton sector interaction can essentially make the electroweak\nvacuum stable upto the Planck scale. On the other hand we observe that the new\nphysics parameters in this combined framework are enough to provide deviation\nfrom the minimal chaotic inflation predictions so as to keep it consistent with\nrecent observation by Planck 2015.\n", "  We use super-spectral curve to investigate irregular conformal states of\ninteger and half-odd integer rank. The spectral curve is the loop equation of\nsupersymmetrized irregular matrix model. The case of integer rank corresponds\nto the colliding limit of supersymmetric vertex operators of NS sector and\nhalf-odd integer to the Ramond sectors. The spectral curve is simply integrable\nat Nekrasov-Shatashvili limit and the partition function (inner product of\nirregular conformal state) is obtained from the superconformal structure\nmanifest in the spectral curve. We present some explicit forms of the partition\nfunction of integer (NS sector) and of half-odd ranks (Ramond sector).\n", "  We introduce the AdS/CFT correspondence as a natural extension of QFT in a\nfixed AdS background. We start by reviewing some general concepts of CFT,\nincluding the embedding space formalism. We then consider QFT in a fixed AdS\nbackground and show that one can define boundary operators that enjoy very\nsimilar properties as in a CFT, except for the lack of a stress tensor.\nIncluding a dynamical metric in AdS generates a boundary stress tensor and\ncompletes the CFT axioms. We also discuss some applications of the bulk\ngeometric intuition to strongly coupled QFT. Finally, we end with a review of\nthe main properties of Mellin amplitudes for CFT correlation functions and\ntheir uses in the context of AdS/CFT.\n", "  We present and discuss initial selection criteria and first results in M33\nfrom a systematic search for extragalactic symbiotic stars. We show that the\npresence of diffuse interstellar gas emission can significantly contaminate the\nspectra of symbiotic star candidates. This important effect forces upon us a\nmore stringent working definition of an extragalactic symbiotic star. We report\nthe first detections and spectroscopic characterisation of 12 symbiotic\nbinaries in M33. We found that four of our systems contain carbon-rich giants.\nIn another two of them the giant seems to be a Zr-enhanced MS star, while the\nremaining six objects host M-type giants. The high number ratio of C to M\ngiants in these binaries is consistent with the low metallicity of M33. The\nspatial and radial velocity distributions of these new symbiotic binaries are\nconsistent with a wide range of progenitor star ages.\n", "  The two interferometers of the Laser Interferometry Gravitaional-wave\nObservatory (LIGO) recently detected gravitational waves from the mergers of\nbinary black hole systems. Accurate calibration of the output of these\ndetectors was crucial for the observation of these events, and the extraction\nof parameters of the sources. The principal tools used to calibrate the\nresponses of the second-generation (Advanced) LIGO detectors to gravitational\nwaves are systems based on radiation pressure and referred to as Photon\nCalibrators. These systems, which were completely redesigned for Advanced LIGO,\ninclude several significant upgrades that enable them to meet the calibration\nrequirements of second-generation gravitational wave detectors in the new era\nof gravitational-wave astronomy. We report on the design, implementation, and\noperation of these Advanced LIGO Photon Calibrators that are currently\nproviding fiducial displacements on the order of $10^{-18}$\nm/$\\sqrt{\\textrm{Hz}}$ with accuracy and precision of better than 1 %.\n", "  We consider a triple-quantum-dot (TQD) system composed by an interacting\nquantum dot connected to two effectively non-interacting dots, which in turn\nare both connected in parallel to metallic leads. As we show, this system can\nbe mapped onto a single-impurity Anderson model with a non-trivial density of\nstates. The TQD's transport properties are investigated under a continuous\ntuning of the non-interacting dots' energy-levels, employing the Numerical\nRenormalization Group technique. Interference between single and many-particle\nresonances splits the Kondo peak, fulfilling a generalized Friedel sum rule. In\naddition, a particular configuration in which one of the non-interacting dots\nis held out of resonance with the leads allows to access a pseudogap regime\nwhere a Kosterlitz-Thouless type quantum-phase-transition (QPT) occur,\nseparating the Kondo and non-Kondo behavior. Within this same configuration,\nthe TQD exhibits traces of the Fano-Kondo effect, which is in turn, strongly\naffected by the QPT. Signatures of all these phenomena are neatly displayed by\nthe calculated linear conductance.\n", "  Calibration of the second-generation LIGO interferometric gravitational-wave\ndetectors employs a method that uses injected periodic modulations to track and\ncompensate for slow temporal variations in the differential length response of\nthe instruments. These detectors utilize feedback control loops to maintain\nresonance conditions by suppressing differential arm length variations. We\ndescribe how the sensing and actuation functions of these servo loops are\nparameterized and how the slow variations in these parameters are quantified\nusing the injected modulations. We report the results of applying this method\nto the LIGO detectors and show that it significantly reduces systematic errors\nin their calibrated outputs.\n", "  We present a new determination of the top-quark mass $m_t$ based on the\nexperimental data from the Tevatron and the LHC for single-top\nhadro-production. We use the inclusive cross sections of $s$- and $t$-channel\ntop-quark production to extract $m_t$ and to minimize the dependence on the\nstrong coupling constant and the gluon distribution in the proton compared to\nthe hadro-production of top-quark pairs. As part of our analysis we compute the\nnext-to-next-to-leading order approximation for the $s$-channel cross section\nin perturbative QCD based on the known soft-gluon corrections and implement it\nin the program Hathor for the numerical evaluation of the hadronic cross\nsection. Results for the top-quark mass are reported in the $\\bar{MS}$ and in\nthe on-shell renormalization scheme.\n", "  We demonstrate the phenomenon of induced-charge capacitive deionization\n(ICCDI) that occurs around a porous and conducting particle immersed in an\nelectrolyte, under the action of an external electric field. The external\nelectric field induces an electric dipole in the porous particle, leading to\nits capacitive charging by both cations and anions at opposite poles. This\nregime is characterized by a long charging time which results in significant\nchanges in salt concentration in the electrically neutral bulk, on the scale of\nthe particle. We qualitatively demonstrate the effect of advection on the\nspatio-temporal concentration field which, through diffusiophoresis, may\nintroduce corrections to the electrophoretic mobility of such particles.\n", "  Forward and adjoint Monte Carlo (MC) models of radiance are proposed for use\nin model-based quantitative photoacoustic tomography. A 2D radiance MC model\nusing a harmonic angular basis is introduced and validated against analytic\nsolutions for the radiance in heterogeneous media. A gradient-based\noptimisation scheme is then used to recover 2D absorption and scattering\ncoefficients distributions from simulated photoacoustic measurements. It is\nshown that the functional gradients, which are a challenge to compute\nefficiently using MC models, can be calculated directly from the coefficients\nof the harmonic angular basis used in the forward and adjoint models. This work\nestablishes a framework for transport-based quantitative photoacoustic\ntomography that can fully exploit emerging highly parallel computing\narchitectures.\n", "  Using optical pump-white light probe spectroscopy the gain dynamics is\ninvestigated for a VECSEL chip which is based on a type-II heterostructure. The\nactive region the chip consists of a GaAs/(GaIn)As/Ga(AsSb)/(GaIn)As/GaAs\nmultiple quantum well. For this structure, a fully microscopic theory predicts\na modal room temperature gain at a wavelength of 1170 nm, which is confirmed by\nexperimental spectra. The results show a gain buildup on the type-II chip which\nis delayed relative to that of a type-I chip. This slower gain dynamics is\nattributed to a diminished cooling rate arising from reduced electron-hole\nscattering.\n", "  The goal of this study is to develop focal, accurate and robust finite\nelement method (FEM) based approaches which can predict the electric potential\non the surface of the computational domain given its structure and internal\nprimary source current distribution. While conducting an EEG evaluation, the\nplacement of source currents to the geometrically complex grey matter\ncompartment is a challenging but necessary task to avoid forward errors\nattributable to tissue conductivity jumps. Here, this task is approached via a\nmathematically rigorous formulation, in which the current field is modeled via\ndivergence conforming H(div) basis functions. Both linear and quadratic\nfunctions are used while the potential field is discretized via the standard\nlinear Lagrangian (nodal) basis. The resulting model includes dipolar sources\nwhich are interpolated into a random set of positions and orientations\nutilizing two alternative approaches: the position based optimization (PBO) and\nthe mean position/orientation (MPO) method. These results demonstrate that the\npresent dipolar approach can reach or even surpass, at least in some respects,\nthe accuracy of two classical reference methods, the partial integration (PI)\nand St. Venant (SV) approach which utilize monopolar loads instead of dipolar\ncurrents.\n", "  Colloidal semiconductor nanoplatelets exhibit quantum size effects due to\ntheir thickness of only few monolayers, together with strong optical band-edge\ntransitions facilitated by large lateral extensions. In this article we\ndemonstrate room temperature strong coupling of the light and heavy hole\nexciton transitions of CdSe nanoplatelets with the photonic modes of an open\nplanar microcavity. Vacuum Rabi splittings of $66 \\pm 1$ meV and $58 \\pm 1$ meV\nare observed for the heavy and light hole excitons respectively, together with\na polariton-mediated hybridisation of both transitions. By measuring the\nconcentration of platelets in the film we compute the transition dipole moment\nof a nanoplatelet exciton to be $\\mu = (575 \\pm 110)$ D. The large oscillator\nstrength and fluorescence quantum yield of semiconductor nanoplatelets provide\na perspective towards novel photonic devices, combining polaritonic and\nspinoptronic effects.\n", "  Spontaneous breaking of quantum scale invariance may provide a solution to\nthe hierarchy and cosmological constant problems. In a scale-invariant\nregularization, we compute the two-loop potential of a higgs-like scalar $\\phi$\nin theories in which scale symmetry is broken only spontaneously by the dilaton\n($\\sigma$). Its vev $\\langle\\sigma\\rangle$ generates the DR subtraction scale\n($\\mu\\sim\\langle\\sigma\\rangle$), which avoids the explicit scale symmetry\nbreaking by traditional regularizations (where $\\mu$=fixed scale). The two-loop\npotential contains effective operators of non-polynomial nature as well as new\ncorrections, beyond those obtained with explicit breaking ($\\mu$=fixed scale).\nThese operators have the form: $\\phi^6/\\sigma^2$, $\\phi^8/\\sigma^4$, etc, which\ngenerate an infinite series of higher dimensional polynomial operators upon\nexpansion about $\\langle\\sigma\\rangle\\gg \\langle\\phi\\rangle$, where such\nhierarchy is arranged by {\\it one} initial, classical tuning. These operators\nemerge at the quantum level from evanescent interactions ($\\propto\\epsilon$)\nbetween $\\sigma$ and $\\phi$ that vanish in $d=4$ but are demanded by classical\nscale invariance in $d=4-2\\epsilon$. The Callan-Symanzik equation of the\ntwo-loop potential is respected and the two-loop beta functions of the\ncouplings differ from those of the same theory regularized with $\\mu=$fixed\nscale. Therefore the running of the couplings enables one to distinguish\nbetween spontaneous and explicit scale symmetry breaking.\n", "  We review what is currently known about the transverse spin structure of\nhadrons, in particular from observables that can be analyzed within a collinear\nframework. These effects have been around for 40 years and represent a critical\ntest of perturbative QCD. We look at both proton-proton and lepton-nucleon\ncollisions for various final states. While the main focus is on transverse\nsingle-spin asymmetries, we also discuss how longitudinal-transverse\ndouble-spin asymmetries offer a complimentary, yet equally important, source of\ninformation on the quark-gluon content of hadrons. We also summarize some\nrecent progress in solidifying the theoretical formalism behind these\nobservables and give an outlook on future directions of research.\n", "  We consider the 3D Cahn-Hilliard equations coupled to, and driven by, the\nforced, incompressible 3D Navier-Stokes equations. The combination, known as\nthe Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes (CHNS) equations, is used in statistical\nmechanics to model the motion of a binary fluid. The potential development of\nsingularities (blow-up) in the contours of the order parameter $\\phi$ is an\nopen problem. To address this we have proved a theorem that closely mimics the\nBeale-Kato-Majda theorem for the $3D$ incompressible Euler equations [Beale et\nal. Commun. Math. Phys., Commun. Math. Phys., ${\\rm 94}$, $ 61-66 ({\\rm\n1984})$]. By taking an $L^{\\infty}$ norm of the energy of the full binary\nsystem, designated as $E_{\\infty}$, we have shown that\n$\\int_{0}^{t}E_{\\infty}(\\tau)\\,d\\tau$ governs the regularity of solutions of\nthe full 3D system. Our direct numerical simulations (DNSs), of the 3D CHNS\nequations, for (a) a gravity-driven Rayleigh Taylor instability and (b) a\nconstant-energy-injection forcing, with $128^3$ to $512^3$ collocation points\nand over the duration of our DNSs, confirm that $E_{\\infty}$ remains bounded as\nfar as our computations allow.\n", "  We introduce columnar shifts---collective rigid-body translations---as a\nstructural degree of freedom relevant to the phase behaviour of molecular\nperovskites ABX$_{\\textrm3}$ (X = molecular anion). Like the well-known\noctahedral tilts of conventional perovskites, shifts also preserve the\noctahedral coordination geometry of the B-site cation in molecular perovskites,\nand so are predisposed to influencing the low-energy dynamics and displacive\nphase transitions of these topical systems. We present a qualitative overview\nof the interplay between shift activation and crystal symmetry breaking, and\nintroduce a generalised terminology to allow characterisation of simple shift\ndistortions, drawing analogy to the \"Glazer notation\" for octahedral tilts. We\napply our approach to the interpretation of a representative selection of azide\nand formate perovskite structures, and discuss the implications for functional\nexploitation of shift degrees of freedom in negative thermal expansion\nmaterials and hybrid ferroelectrics.\n", "  We aim to provide new empirical clues about macroturbulent spectral line\nbroadening in O- and B-type stars to evaluate its physical origin.\n  We use high-resolution spectra of ~430 stars with spectral types in the range\nO4-B9 (all luminosity classes). We characterize the line-broadening of adequate\ndiagnostic metal lines using a combined FT and GOF technique. We perform a\nquantitative spectroscopic analysis of the whole sample using automatic tools\ncoupled with a huge grid of FASTWIND models. We also incorporate quantitative\ninformation about line asymmetries to our observational description of the\ncharacteristics of the line-profiles, and present a comparison of the shape and\ntype of line-profile variability found in a small sample of O stars and B\nsupergiants with still undefined pulsational properties and B main sequence\nstars with variable line-profiles.\n  We present a homogeneous and statistically significant overview of the\n(single snapshot) line-broadening properties of stars in the whole O and B star\ndomain. We find empirical evidence of the existence of various types of\nnon-rotational broadening agents acting in the realm of massive stars. Even\nthough all of them could be quoted and quantified as a macroturbulent\nbroadening from a practical point of view, their physical origin can be\ndifferent. Contrarily to the early- to late-B dwarfs/giants, which present a\nmixture of cases in terms of line-profile shape and variability, the whole\nO-type and B supergiant domain (or, roughly speaking, stars with M_ZAMS > 15\nM_sol) is fully dominated by stars with a remarkable non-rotational broadening\ncomponent and very similar profiles (including type of variability). We provide\nsome examples illustrating how this observational dataset can be used to\nevaluate scenarios aimed at explaining the existence of sources of\nnon-rotational broadening in massive stars.\n", "  Asteroseismology is a powerful tool to access the internal structure of\nstars. Apart from the important impact of theoretical developments, progress in\nthis field has been commonly associated with the analysis of time-resolved\nobservations. Recently, the so-called macroturbulent broadening has been\nproposed to be a complementary and less expensive way -- in terms of\nobservational time -- to investigate pulsations in massive stars. We assess to\nwhat extent this ubiquitous non-rotational broadening component shaping the\nline profiles of O stars and B supergiants is a spectroscopic signature of\npulsation modes driven by a heat mechanism. We compute stellar main sequence\nand post-main sequence models from 3 to 70Msun with the ATON stellar evolution\ncode and determine the instability domains for heat-driven modes for degrees\nl=1-20 using the adiabatic and non-adiabatic codes LOSC and MAD. We use the\nobservational material presented in Sim\\'on-D\\'iaz et al. (2016) to investigate\npossible correlations between the single snapshot line-broadening properties of\na sample of ~260 O and B-type stars and their location inside/outside the\nvarious predicted instability domains. We present an homogeneous prediction for\nthe non-radial instability domains of massive stars for degree l up to 20. We\nprovide a global picture of what to expect from an observational point of view\nin terms of frequency range of excited modes, and investigate the behavior of\nthe instabilities with stellar evolution and increasing degree of the mode.\nFurthermore, our pulsational stability analysis, once compared to the empirical\nresults of Sim\\'on-D\\'iaz et al. (2016), indicates that stellar oscillations\noriginated by a heat mechanism can not explain alone the occurrence of the\nlarge non-rotational line-broadening component commonly detected in the O star\nand B supergiant domain.\n", "  We consider (N,r) games of predation with N species and r < N prey and\npredators, acting in a cyclic way. Further basic reactions include\nreproduction, decay and diffusion over a regular grid, without a hard\nconstraint on the occupation number per site, so in a \"bosonic\" implementation.\nFor special combinations of N and r and appropriate parameter choices we\nobserve games within games, that is, different coexisting games, depending on\nthe spatial resolution. As concrete and simplest example we analyze the (6,3)\ngame. Once the players segregate from a random initial distribution, domains\nemerge, which effectively play a (2,1)-game on the coarse scale of domain\ndiameters, while agents inside the domains play (3,1) (rock-paper-scissors),\nleading to spiral formation with species chasing each other. As the (2,1)-game\nhas a winner in the end, the coexistence of domains is transient, while agents\ninside the remaining domain coexist, until demographic fluctuations lead to\nextinction of all but one species in the very end. This means that we observe a\ndynamical generation of multiple space and time scales with emerging\nre-organization of players upon segregation, starting from a simple set of\nrules on the smallest scale and changed rules from the coarser perspective.\nThese observations are based on Gillespie simulations. We discuss the\ndeterministic limit derived from a van Kampen expansion. The linear stability\nanalysis predicts the number of forming domains, their composition in terms of\nspecies; it also explains the instability of interfaces between domains, which\ndrives their extinction; spiral patterns are identified as motion along\nheteroclinic cycles. The numerical solutions reproduce the observed patterns of\nthe Gillespie simulations including even extinction events, so that the\nmean-field analysis here is very conclusive, which is due to the specific\nimplementation of rules.\n", "  We propose a general method to arbitrarily manipulate an electromagnetic wave\npropagating in a two-dimensional medium, without introducing any scattering.\nThis leads to a whole class of isotropic spatially varying permittivity and\npermeability profiles that are invisible while shaping the field magnitude\nand/or phase. In addition, we propose a metamaterial structure working in the\ninfrared that demonstrates deep sub-wavelength control of the electric field\namplitude and strong reduction of the scattering. This work offers an\nalternative strategy to achieve invisibility with isotropic materials and paves\nthe way for tailoring the propagation of light at the nanoscale\n", "  We use computer simulations to study the cooling rate dependence of the\nstability and energetics of model glasses created at constant pressure\nconditions and compare the results with glasses formed at constant volume\nconditions. To examine the stability, we determine the time it takes for a\nglass cooled and reheated at constant pressure to transform back into a liquid,\n$t_{\\mathrm{trans}}$, and calculate the stability ratio $S =\nt_{\\mathrm{trans}}/\\tau_\\alpha$, where $\\tau_\\alpha$ is the equilibrium\nrelaxation time of the liquid. We find that, for slow enough cooling rates,\ncooling and reheating at constant pressure results in a larger stability ratio\n$S$ than for cooling and reheating at constant volume. We also compare the\nenergetics of glasses obtained by cooling while maintaining constant pressure\nwith those of glasses created by cooling from the same state point while\nmaintaining constant volume. We find that cooling at constant pressure results\nin glasses with lower average potential energy and average inherent structure\nenergy. We note that in model simulations of the vapor deposition process\nglasses are created under constant pressure conditions, and thus they should be\ncompared to glasses obtained by constant pressure cooling.\n", "  I consider the effect of a small concentration of a molecule, such as a\nshort-chain alcohol, on the miscibility transition temperature of a giant\nplasma membrane vesicle. For concentrations sufficiently small such that the\nsystem can be treated as a weak solution, the change in transition temperature\nis known to depend upon the extent of the molecule's partition into the\ncoexisting liquid-disordered and liquid-ordered phases. Preferential\npartitioning into the former decreases the miscibility temperature, while\npreferential partitioning into the latter causes an increase. The analysis,\ncombined with calculated values of the partition coefficient of saturated\nchains, illuminates the results of recent experiments on the change in\nmiscibility transition temperatures with changing alcohol chain length, and\nmakes several testable predictions.\n", "  Recently, $\\mathrm{BaSn_2}$ is predicted to be a strong topological insulator\nby the first-principle calculations. It is well known that topological\ninsulator has a close connection to thermoelectric material, such as\n$\\mathrm{Bi_2Te_3}$ family. In this work, we investigate thermoelectric\nproperties of $\\mathrm{BaSn_2}$ by the first-principles combined with Boltzmann\ntransport theory. The electronic part is carried out by a modified Becke and\nJohnson (mBJ) exchange potential, including spin-orbit coupling (SOC), while\nthe phonon part is performed using generalized gradient approximation (GGA). It\nis found that the electronic transport coefficients between the in-plane and\ncross-plane directions show the strong anisotropy, while lattice lattice\nthermal conductivities show an almost isotropy. Calculated results show a very\nlow lattice thermal conductivity for $\\mathrm{BaSn_2}$, and the corresponding\naverage lattice thermal conductivity at room temperature is 1.69 $\\mathrm{W\nm^{-1} K^{-1}}$, which is comparable or lower than those of lead chalcogenides\nand bismuth-tellurium systems as classic thermoelectric materials. Due to the\ncomplicated scattering mechanism, calculating scattering time $\\tau$ is\nchallenging. By using a empirical $\\tau$=$10^{-14}$ s, the n-type figure of\nmerit $ZT$ is greater than 0.40 in wide temperature range. Experimentally, it\nis possible to attain better thermoelectric performance, or to enhance one by\nstrain or tuning size parameter. This work indicates that $\\mathrm{BaSn_2}$ may\nbe a potential thermoelectric material, which can stimulate further theoretical\nand experimental works.\n", "  Machine learning tools are commonly used in modern high energy physics (HEP)\nexperiments. Different models, such as boosted decision trees (BDT) and\nartificial neural networks (ANN), are widely used in analyses and even in the\nsoftware triggers.\n  In most cases, these are classification models used to select the \"signal\"\nevents from data. Monte Carlo simulated events typically take part in training\nof these models. While the results of the simulation are expected to be close\nto real data, in practical cases there is notable disagreement between\nsimulated and observed data. In order to use available simulation in training,\ncorrections must be introduced to generated data. One common approach is\nreweighting - assigning weights to the simulated events. We present a novel\nmethod of event reweighting based on boosted decision trees. The problem of\nchecking the quality of reweighting step in analyses is also discussed.\n", "  We obtain the anomaly polynomial of strings of general 6d\n$\\mathcal{N}{=}(1,0)$ theories in terms of anomaly inflow. Our computation\nsheds some light on the reason why the simplest 6d $\\mathcal{N}{=}(1,0)$ theory\nhas $E_8$ flavor symmetry, and also partially explains a curious numerology in\nF-theory.\n", "  Two-loop QCD correction to massive spin-2 Graviton decaying to $q ~ + ~\n\\bar{q}~ + ~g$ is presented considering a generic universal spin-2 coupling to\nthe SM through the conserved energy-momentum tensor. Such a massive spin-2\nparticle can arise in extra-dimensional models. The ultraviolet and infrared\nstructure of the QCD amplitudes are studied. In dimensional regularisation, the\ninfrared pole structure is in agreement with Catani's proposal, confirming the\nuniversal factorization property of QCD amplitudes, even with the spin-2\ntensorial coupling. This computation now completes the full two-loop QCD\ncorrections for the production of a spin-2 in association with a jet.\n", "  We show that different (brane and constrained superfield) descriptions for\nthe Volkov-Akulov goldstino coupled to N=1, D=4 supergravity with matter\nproduce similar wide classes of models with spontaneously broken local\nsupersymmetry and discuss the relation between the different formulations. As\nwith the formulations with irreducible constrained superfields, the geometric\ngoldstino brane approach has the advantage of being manifestly off-shell\nsupersymmetric without the need to introduce auxiliary fields. It provides an\nexplicit solution of the nilpotent superfield constraints and avoids issues\nwith non-Gaussian integration of auxiliary fields. We describe general\ncouplings of the supersymmetry breaking sector, including the goldstino and\nother non-supersymmetric matter, to supergravity and matter supermultiplets.\nAmong various examples, we discuss a goldstino brane contribution to the\ngravitino mass term and the supersymmetrization of the anti-D3-brane\ncontribution to the effective theory of type IIB warped flux compactifications.\n", "  We investigate spin dynamics in the antiferromagnetic (AFM) multiferroic\nTbMnO3 using optical- pump, terahertz (THz)-probe spectroscopy. Photoexcitation\nresults in a broadband THz transmission change, with an onset time of 25 ps at\n6 K that becomes faster at higher temperatures. We attribute this time constant\nto spin-lattice thermalization. The excellent agreement between our\nmeasurements and previous ultrafast resonant x-ray diffraction measurements on\nthe same material confirms that our THz pulse directly probes spin order. We\nsuggest that this could be the case in general for insulating AFM materials, if\nthe origin of the static absorption in the THz spectral range is magnetic.\n", "  Single-crystalline UAu$_2$Si$_2$ has been grown by a floating-zone melting\nmethod, and its magnetic, thermal and transport properties have been\ninvestigated through measurements of magnetization, specific heat and\nelectrical resistivity to reveal its peculiar magnetism. It is shown that\nUAu$_2$Si$_2$ undergoes a second-order phase transition at \\tm = 19 K, which\nhad been believed to be ferromagnetic ordering in the literature, from a\nparamagnetic phase to an uncompensated antiferromagnetic phase with spontaneous\nmagnetization along the tetragonal $c$-axis (the easy magnetization direction).\nThe magnetic entropy analysis points to the itinerant character of 5f electrons\nin the magnetic ordered state of UAu$_2$Si$_2$ with large enhancement of the\nelectronic specific heat coefficient of $\\gamma$ $\\sim$ 150 mJ/K$^2$mol at 2 K.\nIt also reveals the relatively isotropic crystalline electric field effect of\nthis compound, with contrast to the other relative isostructural compounds. The\nobserved magnetization curves strongly suggest that there is a parasitic\nferromagnetic component developing below $\\sim$ 50 K in high coercivity with\nthe easy axis along the tetragonal $c$-axis. The results are discussed in the\ncontext of evolution of magnetism within the entire family of isostructural\nU$T_2$Si$_2$ compounds.\n", "  We study the coupled dynamics of normal and superfluid components of the\nsuperfluid $^4$He in the channel considering the counterflow turbulence with\nlaminar normal component. In particular, we calculated profiles of the normal\nvelocity, the mutual friction, the vortex line density and other flow\nproperties and compared them to the case when the dynamic of the normal\ncomponent is \"frozen\". We have found that the coupling between the normal and\nsuperfluid components leads to flattening of the normal velocity profile,\nincreasingly more pronounced with temperature, as the mutual friction, and\ntherefore coupling, becomes stronger. The commonly measured flow properties\nalso change when the coupling between two components is taken into account.\n", "  The quantum $\\tau_2$-model with generic site-dependent inhomogeneity and\narbitrary boundary fields is studied via the off-diagonal Bethe Ansatz method.\nThe eigenvalues of the corresponding transfer matrix are given in terms of an\ninhomogeneous T-Q relation, which is based on the operator product identities\namong the fused transfer matrices and the asymptotic behavior of the transfer\nmatrices. Moreover, the associated Bethe Ansatz equations are also obtained.\n", "  We explore the landscape of technical naturalness for nonrelativistic\nsystems, finding surprises which challenge and enrich our relativistic\nintuition already in the simplest case of a single scalar field. While the\nimmediate applications are expected in condensed matter and perhaps in\ncosmology, the study is motivated by the leading puzzles of fundamental physics\ninvolving gravity: The cosmological constant problem and the Higgs mass\nhierarchy problem.\n", "  Anisotropy of the quadratic Zeeman effect for the $^3{\\rm H}_6 \\rightarrow \\,\n^3{\\rm H}_4$ transition at 793 nm wavelength in $^{169}$Tm$^{3+}$-doped\nY$_3$Al$_5$O$_{12}$ is studied, revealing shifts ranging from near zero up to +\n4.69 GHz/T$^2$ for ions in magnetically inequivalent sites. This large range of\nshifts is used to spectrally resolve different subsets of ions and study\nnuclear spin relaxation as a function of temperature, magnetic field strength,\nand orientation in a site-selective manner. A rapid decrease in spin lifetime\nis found at large magnetic fields, revealing the weak contribution of\ndirect-phonon absorption and emission to the nuclear spin-lattice relaxation\nrate. We furthermore confirm theoretical predictions for the phonon coupling\nstrength, finding much smaller values than those estimated in the limited\nnumber of past studies of thulium in similar crystals. Finally, we observe a\nsignificant -- and unexpected -- magnetic field dependence of the two-phonon\nOrbach spin relaxation process at higher field strengths, which we explain\nthrough changes in the electronic energy-level splitting arising from the\nquadratic Zeeman effect.\n", "  When biased at a voltage just below a superconductor's energy gap, a tunnel\njunction between this superconductor and a normal metal cools the latter. While\nthe study of such devices has long been focussed to structures of submicron\nsize and consequently cooling power in the picoWatt range, we have led a\nthorough study of devices with a large cooling power up to the nanoWatt range.\nHere we describe how their performance can be optimized by using a\nquasi-particle drain and tuning the cooling junctions' tunnel barrier.\n", "  The study of pyroelectric response of monocrystalline TGS cubic specimens to\nchanges of temperature induced by linear and pulse heating of three mutually\nperpendicular pairs of cube sides demonstrated a complicated structure of\nsignals. We attribute their forms to the activation of various hydrogen bonds\nbetween glycine I, II, III molecules. In the case of pulse heating the\npyroelectric signal is observed also in the paraelectric phase. The applied\nmeasurement method is relatively simple but precise and can be realized in most\nof dielectric measurements laboratories.\n", "  We propose a novel method to manipulate the state of a single electron spin\nin a semiconductor quantum dot (QD). The manipulation is achieved by tunnel\ncoupling a QD, labeled $L$, and occupied with an electron to an adjacent QD,\nlabeled $R$, which is not occupied by an electron but having an energy linearly\nvarying in time. We identify a parameter regime in which a complete population\ntransfer between the spin eigenstates $|L\\uparrow\\rangle$ and\n$|L\\downarrow\\rangle$ is achieved without occupying the adjacent QD. This\nmethod is convenient due to the fact that manipulation can be done\nelectrically, without the precise knowledge of the spin resonance condition,\nand is robust against Zeeman level broadening caused by nuclear spins.\n", "  We study cosmological implications of bigravity and massive gravity solutions\nwith non-simultaneously diagonal metrics by considering the generalized Gordon\nand Kerr-Schild ansatzes. The scenario that we obtain is equivalent to that of\nGeneral Relativity with additional non-comoving perfect fluids. We show that\nthe most general ghost-free bimetric theory generates three kinds of effective\nfluids whose equations of state are fixed by a function of the ansatz.\nDifferent choices of such function allow to reproduce the behaviour of\ndifferent dark fluids. In particular, the Gordon ansatz is suitable for the\ndescription of various kinds of slowly-moving fluids, whereas the Kerr-Schild\none is shown to describe a null dark energy component. The motion of those dark\nfluids with respect to the CMB is shown to generate, in turn, a relative motion\nof baryonic matter with respect to radition which contributes to the CMB\nanisotropies. CMB dipole observations are able to set stringent limits on the\ndark sector described by the effective bimetric fluid.\n", "  Using exact diagonalization and quantum Monte Carlo calculations we\ninvestigate the effects of disorder on the phase diagram of both\nnon-interacting and interacting models of two-dimensional topological\ninsulators. In the fermion sign problem-free interacting models we study,\nelectron-electron interactions are described by an on-site repulsive Hubbard\ninteraction and disorder is included via the one-body hopping operators. In\nboth the non-interacting and interacting models we make use of recent advances\nin highly accurate real-space numerical evaluation of topological invariants to\ncompute phase boundaries, and in the non-interacting models determine critical\nexponents of the transitions. We find different models exhibit distinct\nstability conditions of the topological phase with respect to interactions and\ndisorder. We provide a general analytical theory that accurately predicts these\ntrends.\n", "  We study analytical properties of the generalized $\\lambda$-deformation,\nwhich modifies string theories while preserving integrability, and construct\nthe explicit backgrounds corresponding to AdS_p x S^p, including the\nRamond-Ramond fluxes. For an arbitrary coset, we find the general form of the\nR-matrix underlying the deformation, and prove that the dilaton is not modified\nby the deformation, while the frames are multiplied by a constant matrix. Our\nexplicit solutions describe families of integrable string theories depending on\nseveral continuous parameters.\n", "  In this article, we aim to provide the community with the dependence of the\nhabitable zone upon the stellar mass, metallicity, rotation, and for various\nprescriptions of the limits of the habitable zone. We use the STAREVOL code to\nstudy the evolution of the habitable zone and of the continuously habitable\nzone limits. Mass and metallicity are the stellar parameters that have the most\ndramatic effects on the habitable zone limits. Conversely, for a given stellar\nmass and metallicity, stellar rotation has only a marginal effect on these\nlimits and does not modify the width of the habitable zone. The evolution of\nthe habitable zone limits is also correlated to the evolution of the stellar\nactivity (through the Rossby number) that depends on the stellar mass\nconsidered. While the magnetic activity has negligible consequence in the case\nof more massive stars, these effects may have a strong impact on the\nhabitability of a planet around M dwarf stars. Thus, stellar activity cannot be\nneglected and may have strong impacts on the development of life during the\nearly stage of the continuously habitable zone phase of low-mass stars. Using\nobserved trends of stellar magnetic field strength we also constrain the\nplanetary magnetic field (at the zero order) required for a sufficient\nmagnetospheric protection during the whole stellar evolution. We explicit for\nthe first time the systematic dependence of planet habitability on stellar\nparameters along the full evolution of low- and intermediate-mass stars. These\nresults can be used as physical inputs for a first order estimation of\nexoplanetary habitability.\n", "  To describe chemical ordering in solid solutions systems Warren-Cowley\nshort-range parameters are ordinarily used. However, they are not directly\nsuited for application to long-range ordered systems, as they do not converge\nto zero for large separations. It is the aim of this paper to generalize the\ntheory to long-range ordered systems and quantitatively discuss chemical\nshort-range order beyond the superstructure arrangements. This is demonstrated\non the example of a non-stoichiometric B2-ordered intermetallic alloy.\nParameters of interatomic potentials are taken from an embedded atom method\n(EAM) calculations and the degree of order is simulated by the Monte Carlo\nmethod. Both on-lattice and off-lattice methods, where the latter allows\nindividual atoms to deviate from their regular lattice sites, were used, and\nthe resulting effects are discussed.\n", "  We propose a novel multi-domain grid refinement technique with extensions to\nentropic incompressible, thermal and compressible lattice Boltzmann models. Its\nvalidity and accuracy are accessed by comparison to available direct numerical\nsimulation and experiment for the simulation of isothermal, thermal and viscous\nsupersonic flow. In particular, we investigate the advantages of grid\nrefinement for the set-ups of turbulent channel flow, flow past a sphere,\nRayleigh-Benard convection as well as the supersonic flow around an airfoil.\nSpecial attention is payed to analyzing the adaptive features of entropic\nlattice Boltzmann models for multi-grid simulations.\n", "  The question of universality class of pair contact process with diffusion\n(PCPD) is revisited with an alternative approach. We study persistence in\nGeneralized Pair-Contact Process with diffusion (GPCPD) introduced by Noh and\nPark, (Phys. Rev. E 69,016122(2004)). This model allows us to interpolate\nbetween directed percolation (DP) and PCPD universality classes. We find that\ntransition to nonzero persistence is at same parameter value as transition to\nzero number density. We obtain finite size scaling and off-critical scaling\ncollapse for persistence and find critical exponents by fitting\nphenomenological scaling laws to persistence. While the dynamic scaling\nexponent $z$ varies continuously in GPCPD, the correlation-time exponent\n$\\nu_\\parallel$ matches with directed percolation universality class.\n", "  From the electrical resistivity and ac susceptibility measurements down to\n$T$ = 40 mK, a rich temperature-field phase diagram has been constructed for\nthe geometrically frustrated heavy-fermion compound CePdAl. In the limit of\nzero temperature, the field-induced suppression of the antiferromagnetism in\nthis compound results in a sequence of phase transitions/corssovers, rather\nthan a single critical point, in a critical region of field 3$-$5 T. In the\nlowest temperature region, a power-law description of the temperature-dependent\nresistivity yields $A$$\\cdot$$T^n$ with $n$$>$2 for all applied fields.\nHowever, a quadratic-in-temperature resistivity term can be extracted when\nassuming an additional electron scattering channel from magnon-like\nexcitations, with $A$ diverging upon approaching the critical regime. Our\nobservations suggest CePdAl to be a new playground for exotic physics arising\nfrom the competition between Kondo screening and geometrical frustration.\n", "  Extensive air showers initiated by ultra-high energy cosmic rays are\nsensitive to the details of hadronic interactions models, so we present the\nmain results obtained using the data of the Pierre Auger Observatory. The depth\nat which the maximum of the electromagnetic development takes place is the most\nsensitive parameter to infer the nature of the cosmic rays. However, the\nhadronic models cannot describe consistently the maximum and the muon\nmeasurements at energies higher than those reached at the LHC.\n", "  In approximate density functional theory (DFT), the self-interaction error is\nan electron delocalization anomaly associated with underestimated insulating\ngaps. It exhibits a predominantly quadratic energy-density curve that is\namenable to correction using efficient, constraint-resembling methods such as\nDFT + Hubbard $U$ (DFT+$U$). Constrained DFT (cDFT) enforces conditions on DFT\nexactly, by means of self-consistently optimized Lagrange multipliers, and\nwhile its use to automate error corrections is a compelling possibility, we\nshow that it is limited by a fundamental incompatibility with constraints\nbeyond linear order. We circumvent this problem by utilizing separate linear\nand quadratic correction terms, which may be interpreted either as distinct\nconstraints, each with its own Hubbard $U$ type Lagrange multiplier, or as the\ncomponents of a generalized DFT+$U$ functional. The latter approach prevails in\nour tests on a model one-electron system, $H_2^+$, in that it readily recovers\nthe exact total-energy while symmetry-preserving pure constraints fail to do\nso. The generalized DFT+$U$ functional moreover enables the simultaneous\ncorrection of the total-energy and ionization potential or the correction of\neither together with the enforcement of Koopmans condition. For the latter\ncase, we outline a practical, approximate scheme by which the required pair of\nHubbard parameters, denoted as U1 and U2, may be calculated from\nfirst-principles.\n", "  Warped models with the Higgs in the bulk can generate light Kaluza-Klein (KK)\nHiggs modes consistent with the electroweak precision analysis. The first KK\nmode of the Higgs (h_{1}) could lie in the 1-2 TeV range in the models with a\nbulk custodial symmetry. We find that the h_{1} is gaugephobic and decays\ndominantly into a t\\bar{t} pair. We also discuss the search strategy for h_{1}\ndecaying to t\\bar{t} at the Large Hadron Collider. We used substructure tools\nto suppress the large QCD background associated with this channel. We find that\nh_{1} can be probed at the LHC run-2 with an integrated luminosity of 300\nfb^{-1}.\n", "  Context: The galaxy cluster Abell S1101 (S1101 hereafter) deviates\nsignificantly from the X-ray luminosity versus velocity dispersion relation\n(L-sigma) of galaxy clusters in our previous study. Given reliable X-ray\nluminosity measurement combining XMM-Newton and ROSAT, this could most likely\nbe caused by the bias in the velocity dispersion due to interlopers and low\nmember statistic in the previous sample of member galaxies, which was solely\nbased on 20 galaxy redshifts drawn from the literature. Aims: We intend to\nincrease the galaxy member statistic to perform a precision measurement of the\nvelocity dispersion and dynamical mass of S1101. We aim for a detailed\nsubstructure and dynamical state characterization of this cluster, and a\ncomparison of mass estimates derived from (i) the velocity dispersion (M_vir),\n(ii) the caustic mass computation (M_caustic), and (iii) mass proxies from\nX-ray observations and the Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) effect. Methods: We carried\nout new optical spectroscopic observations of the galaxies in this cluster\nfield with VIMOS, obtaining a sample of ~60 member galaxies for S1101. We\nrevised the cluster redshift and velocity dispersion measurements based on this\nsample and also applied the Dressler-Shectman substructure test. Results: The\ncompleteness of cluster members within r200 was significantly improved for this\ncluster. Tests for dynamical substructure did not show evidence for major\ndisturbances or merging activities in S1101. We find good agreement between the\ndynamical cluster mass measurements and X-ray mass estimates which confirms the\nrelaxed state of the cluster displayed in the 2D substructure test. The SZ mass\nproxy is slightly higher than the other estimates. The updated measurement of\nthe velocity dispersion erased the deviation of S1101 in the L-sigma relation.\n", "  We present self-consistent calculations coupling numerical hydrodynamics\nsimulations of collapsing pre-stellar cores and stellar evolution models of\naccreting objects. We analyse the main impact of consistent accretion history\non the evolution and lithium depletion of young low-mass stars and brown\ndwarfs. These consistent models confirm the generation of a luminosity spread\nin Herzsprung-Russell diagrams at ages $\\sim$ 1-10 Myr. They also confirm that\nearly accretion can produce objects with abnormal Li depletion, as found in a\nprevious study that was based on arbitrary accretion rates. The results\nstrengthen that objects with anomalously high level of Li depletion in young\nclusters should be extremely rare. We also find that early phases of burst\naccretion can produce coeval models of similar mass with a range of different\nLi surface abundances, and in particular with Li-excess compared to the\npredictions of non-accreting counterparts. This result is due to a subtle\ncompetition between the effect of burst accretion and its impact on the central\nstellar temperature, the growth of the stellar radiative core and the accretion\nof fresh Li from the accretion disk. Only consistent models could reveal such a\nsubtle combination of effects. This new result could explain the recent,\npuzzling observations of Li-excess of fast rotators in the young cluster NGC\n2264. Present self-consistent accreting models are available in electronic\nform.\n", "  Shock compression of silicon (Si) under extremely high pressures (>100 Mbar)\nwas investigated by using two first-principles methods of orbital-free\nmolecular dynamics (OFMD) and path integral Monte Carlo (PIMC). While pressures\nfrom the two methods agree very well, PIMC predicts a second compression\nmaximum because of 1s electron ionization that is absent in OFMD calculations\nsince Thomas-Fermi-based theories lack shell structure. The Kohn-Sham density\nfunctional theory is used to calculate the equation of state (EOS) of warm\ndense silicon for low-pressure loadings (P < 100 Mbar). Combining these\nfirst-principles EOS results, the principal shock Hugoniot curve of silicon for\npressures varying from 1 Mbar to above 10 Gbar was derived. We find that\nsilicon is 20% or more softer than what was predicted by widely-used EOS\nmodels. Existing high-pressure experimental data (P = 1 - 2 Mbar) seem to\nindicate this softening behavior of Si, which calls for future strong-shock\nexperiments (P > 10 Mbar) to benchmark our results.\n", "  We performed comparable polarized Raman scattering studies of MoTe2 and WTe2.\nBy rotating crystals to tune the angle between the principal axis of the\ncrystals and the polarization of the incident/scattered light, we obtained the\nangle dependence of the intensities for all the observed modes, which is\nperfectly consistent with careful symmetry analysis. Combining these results\nwith first-principles calculations, we clearly identified the observed phonon\nmodes in the different phases of both crystals. Fifteen Raman-active phonon\nmodes (10Ag+5Bg) in the high-symmetry phase 1T'-MoTe2 (300 K) were well\nassigned, and all the symmetry-allowed Raman modes (11A1+6A2) in the\nlow-symmetry phase Td-MoTe2 (10 K) and 12 Raman phonons (8A1+4A2) in Td-WTe2\nwere observed and identified. The present work provides basic information about\nthe lattice dynamics in transition-metal dichalcogenides and may shed some\nlight on the understanding of the extremely large magnetoresistance (MR) in\nthis class of materials.\n", "  In this paper, we demonstrate that a unified description of early and\nlate-time acceleration is possible in the context of mimetic $F(R)$ gravity. We\nstudy the inflationary era in detail and demonstrate that it can be realized\neven in mimetic $F(R)$ gravity where traditional $F(R)$ gravity fails to\ndescribe the inflation. By using standard methods we calculated the spectral\nindex of primordial curvature perturbations and the scalar-to-tensor ratio. We\nuse two $F(R)$ gravity models and as it turns out, for both the models under\nstudy the observational indices are compatible with both the latest Planck and\nthe BICEP2/Keck array data. Finally, the graceful exit from inflation is\nguaranteed by the existence of growing curvature perturbations when the\nslow-roll era ends.\n", "  We evaluate the $2$nd to $4$th order baryon, charge and strangeness\nsusceptibilities near a chiral critical point using the Nambu--Jona--Lasinio\nmodel under different temperature and baryon chemical potential. Baryon number\nsusceptibilities are found to be of the greatest magnitude, offering the\nstrongest signal. Whereas the strangeness susceptibilities have the smallest\ndivergence dominating area, owing to the large strange quark mass. We also make\nan attempt to compare our results with experiment data. The trend at high\ncollision energy are found to be consistent between theory and experiment. The\nmodel calculation predicts more complex behavior at low collision energies,\nnear the postulated critical end point.\n", "  We construct a large set of dynamical models of the galactic bulge, bar and\ninner disk using the Made-to-Measure method. Our models are constrained to\nmatch the red clump giant density from a combination of the VVV, UKIDSS and\n2MASS infrared surveys together with stellar kinematics in the bulge from the\nBRAVA and OGLE surveys, and in the entire bar region from the ARGOS survey. We\nare able to recover the bar pattern speed and the stellar and dark matter mass\ndistributions in the bar region, thus recovering the entire galactic effective\npotential. We find a bar pattern speed of $39.0 \\pm 3.5\n\\,\\rm{km\\,s^{-1}\\,kpc^{-1}}$, placing the bar corotation radius at $6.1 \\pm 0.5\n\\rm{kpc}$ and making the Milky Way bar a typical fast rotator. We evaluate the\nstellar mass of the long bar and bulge structure to be $M_{\\rm{bar/bulge}} =\n1.88 \\pm 0.12 \\times 10^{10} \\, \\rm{M}_{\\odot}$, larger than the mass of disk\nin the bar region, $M_{\\rm{inner\\ disk}} = 1.29\\pm0.12 \\times 10^{10} \\,\n\\rm{M}_{\\odot}$. The total dynamical mass in the bulge volume is\n$1.85\\pm0.05\\times 10^{10} \\, \\rm{M}_{\\odot}$. Thanks to more extended\nkinematic data sets and recent measurement of the bulge IMF our models have a\nlow dark matter fraction in the bulge of $17\\%\\pm2\\%$. We find a dark matter\ndensity profile which flattens to a shallow cusp or core in the bulge region.\nFinally, we find dynamical evidence for an extra central mass of\n$\\sim0.2\\times10^{10} \\,\\rm{M}_{\\odot}$, probably in a nuclear disk or disky\npseudobulge.\n", "  Multiphoton detachment of F$^-$ by strong few-cycle laser pulses was studied\nby Shearer and Monteith using a Keldysh-type approach [Phys. Rev. A 88, 033415\n(2013)]. We believe that this work contained errors in the calculation of the\ndetachment amplitude and photoelectron spectra. We describe the necessary\ncorrections to the theory and show that the results, in particular, the\ninterference features of the photoelectron spectra, appear noticeably\ndifferent.\n", "  The only available analytical framework for investigating QED processes in a\nstrong laser field systematically relies on approximating the latter as a plane\nwave. However, realistic high-intensity laser beams feature much more complex\nspace-time structures than plane waves. Here, we show the feasibility of an\nanalytical framework for investigating strong-field QED processes in laser\nbeams of arbitrary space-time structure by determining the energy spectrum of\npositrons produced via nonlinear Breit-Wheeler pair production as a function of\nthe background field in the realistic assumption that the energy of the\nincoming photon is the largest dynamical energy in the problem. A numerical\nevaluation of the angular resolved positron spectrum shows significant\nquantitative differences with respect to the analogous result in a plane wave,\nsuch that the present results will be also important for the design of upcoming\nstrong laser facilities aiming at measuring this process.\n", "  Aims: We search for low-mass companions of M dwarfs and characterize their\nmultiplicity fraction with the purpose of helping in the selection of the most\nappropriate targets for the CARMENES exoplanet survey. Methods: We obtained\nhigh-resolution images in the I band with the lucky imaging instrument FastCam\nat the 1.5 m Telescopio Carlos Sanchez for 490 mid- to late-M dwarfs. For all\nthe detected binaries, we measured angular separations, position angles, and\nmagnitude differences in the I band. We also calculated the masses of each\nindividual component and estimated orbital periods, using the available\nmagnitude and colour relations for M dwarfs and our own MJ-spectral type and\nmass-MI relations. To avoid biases in our sample selection, we built a\nvolume-limited sample of M0.0-M5.0 dwarfs that is complete up to 86% within 14\npc. Results: From the 490 observed stars, we detected 80 companions in 76\nsystems, of which 30 are new discoveries. The multiplicity fraction in our\nobserved sample is 16.7+-2.0% . In our volume-limited sample it is 19.5+-2.3%\nfor angular separations of 0.2 to 5.0 arcsec (1.4-65.6 au), The distribution of\nthe projected physical separations peaks at 2.5-7.5 au. For M0.0-M3.5 V\nprimaries, our search is sensitive to mass ratios higher than 0.3. Binaries\nwith projected physical separations shorter than 50 au tend to be of equal\nmass. For 26 of our systems, we estimated orbital periods shorter than 50 a, 10\nof which are presented here for the first time. We measured variations in\nangular separation and position angle that are due to orbital motions in 17 of\nthese systems. The contribution of binaries and multiples with angular\nseparations shorter than 0.2 arcsec, longer than 5.0 arcsec, and of\nspectroscopic binaries identified from previous searches, although not\ncomplete, may increase the multiplicity fraction of M dwarfs in our\nvolume-limited sample to at least 36%.\n", "  We use first-principles simulations to investigate the topological properties\nof Bi$_2$Se$_3$ thin films deposited on amorphous SiO2, Bi$_2$Se$_3$/a-SiO$_2$,\nwhich is a promising substrate for topological insulator (TI) based device\napplications. The Bi$_2$Se$_3$ films are bonded to a-SiO$_2$ mediated by van\nder Waals interactions. Upon interaction with the substrate, the Bi$_2$Se$_3$\ntopological surface and interface states remain present, however the degeneracy\nbetween the Dirac-like cones is broken. The energy separation between the two\nDirac-like cones increases with the number of Bi$_2$Se$_3$ quintuple layers\n(QLs) deposited on the substrate. Such a degeneracy breaking is caused by (i)\ncharge transfer from the TI to the substrate and charge redistribution along\nthe Bi$_2$Se$_3$ QLs, and (ii) by deformation of the QL in contact with the\na-SiO$_2$ substrate. We also investigate the role played by oxygen vacancies\n(V$_O$) on the a-SiO$_2$, which increases the energy splitting between the two\nDirac-like cones. Finally, by mapping the electronic structure of\nBi$_2$Se$_3$/a-SiO$_2$, we found that the a-SiO$_2$ surface states, even upon\nthe presence of V$_O$, play a minor role on gating the electronic transport\nproperties of Bi$_2$Se$_3$.\n", "  Using direct numerical simulations of three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic\n(MHD) turbulence the spatio-temporal behavior of magnetic field fluctuations is\nanalyzed. Cases with relatively small, medium and large values of a mean\nbackground magnetic field are considered. The (wavenumber) scale dependent time\ncorrelation function is directly computed for different simulations, varying\nthe mean magnetic field value. From this correlation function the time\ndecorrelation is computed and compared with different theoretical times,\nnamely, the local non-linear time, the random sweeping time, and the Alfv\\'enic\ntime, the latter being a wave effect. It is observed that time decorrelations\nare dominated by sweeping effects, and only at large values of the mean\nmagnetic field and for wave vectors mainly aligned with this field time\ndecorrelations are controlled by Alfv\\'enic effects.\n", "  Interacting particle systems in the KPZ universality class on a ring of size\n$L$ with $O(L)$ number of particles are expected to change from KPZ dynamics to\nequilibrium dynamics at the so-called relaxation time scale $t=O(L^{3/2})$. In\nparticular the system size is expected to have little effect to the particle\nfluctuations in the sub-relaxation time scale $t\\ll L^{3/2}$. We prove that\nthis is indeed the case for the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process\n(TASEP) with two types of initial conditions. For flat initial condition, we\nshow that the particle fluctuations are given by the Airy$_1$ process as in the\ninfinite TASEP with flat initial condition. On the other hand, the TASEP on a\nring with step initial condition is equivalent to the periodic TASEP with a\ncertain shock initial condition. We compute the fluctuations explicitly both\naway from and near the shocks for the infinite TASEP with same initial\ncondition, and then show that the periodic TASEP has same fluctuations in the\nsub-relaxation time scale.\n", "  A gamma counting station based on high-purity germanium (HPGe) detector was\nset up for the material screening of the PandaX dark matter experiments in the\nChina Jinping Underground Laboratory. Low background gamma rate of 2.6\ncounts/min within the energy range of 20 to 2700 keV is achieved due to the\nwell-designed passive shield. The sentivities of the HPGe detetector reach\nmBq/kg level for isotopes like K, U, Th, and even better for Co and Cs,\nresulted from the low-background rate and the high relative detection\nefficiency of 175%. The structure and performance of the counting station are\ndescribed in this article. Detailed counting results for the radioactivity in\nmaterials used by the PandaX dark-matter experiment are presented. The\nupgrading plan of the counting station is also discussed.\n", "  In s-wave systems, it has been theoretically shown that a ferromagnetic film\nhosting a skyrmion can induce a bound state embedded in the opposite-spin\ncontinuum. In this work, we consider a case of skyrmion-induced state in a\np-wave superconductor. We find that the skyrmion induces a bound state that\ngenerally resides \\emph{within} the spectral gap and is isolated from all other\nstates, in contrast to the case of conventional superconductors. To this end,\nwe derive an approximate expression for the $T$-matrix, through which we\ncalculate the spin-polarized local density of states which is observable in\nscanning tunneling microscopy measurements. We find the unique spectroscopic\nfeatures of the skyrmion-induced bound state and discuss how our predictions\ncould be employed as novel experimental probes for p-wave superconducting\nstates.\n", "  We revisit the transport properties induced by the chiral anomaly in a\ncharged plasma holographically dual to anomalous $U(1)_V\\times U(1)_A$ Maxwell\ntheory in Schwarzschild-$AdS_5$. Off-shell constitutive relations for vector\nand axial currents are derived using various approximations generalising most\nof known in the literature anomaly-induced phenomena and revealing some new\nones. In a weak external field approximation, the constitutive relations have\nall-order derivatives resummed into six momenta-dependent transport coefficient\nfunctions: the diffusion, the electric/magnetic conductivity, and three anomaly\ninduced functions. The latter generalise the chiral magnetic and chiral\nseparation effects. Nonlinear transport is studied assuming presence of\nconstant background external fields. The chiral magnetic effect, including all\norder nonlinearity in magnetic field, is proven to be exact when the magnetic\nfield is the only external field that is turned on. Non-linear corrections to\nthe constitutive relations due to electric and axial external fields are\ncomputed.\n", "  We present the discovery of the X-ray and optical afterglows of the\nshort-duration GRB 150101B, pinpointing the event to an early-type host galaxy\nat z=0.1343 +/- 0.0030. This makes GRB 150101B the most nearby short GRB with\nan early-type host galaxy discovered to date. Fitting the spectral energy\ndistribution of the host galaxy results in an inferred stellar mass of ~7x10^10\nM_sol, stellar population age of ~2-2.5 Gyr, and star formation rate of <0.4\nM_sol yr^-1. The host of GRB 150101B is one of the largest and most luminous\nshort GRB host galaxies, with a B-band luminosity of ~4.3L* and half-light\nradius of ~8 kpc. GRB 150101B is located at a projected distance of 7.35 +/-\n0.07 kpc from its host center, and lies on a faint region of its host\nrest-frame optical light. Its location, combined with the lack of associated\nsupernova, is consistent with a NS-NS/NS-BH merger progenitor. From modeling\nthe evolution of the broad-band afterglow, we calculate isotropic-equivalent\ngamma-ray and kinetic energies of ~1.3x10^49 erg and ~(6-14)x10^51 erg,\nrespectively, a circumburst density of ~(0.8-4)x10^-5 cm^-3, and a jet opening\nangle of >9 deg. Using observations extending to ~30 days, we place upper\nlimits of <(2-4)x10^41 erg s^-1 on associated kilonova emission. We compare\nsearches following previous short GRBs to existing kilonova models, and\ndemonstrate the difficulty of performing effective kilonova searches from\ncosmological short GRBs using current ground-based facilities. We show that at\nthe Advanced LIGO/VIRGO horizon distance of 200 Mpc, searches reaching depths\nof ~23-24 AB mag are necessary to probe a meaningful range of kilonova models.\n", "  It is well known that some black holes can act as accelerators for particles\nwithout spin. Recently, there are some works considering collision of two\nspinning particles in the background of Schwarzschild and Kerr black holes and\nit was shown that {the center-of-mass energy of the test particles is related\nto the spin}. In this paper we extend the results to some more general cases.\nWe consider Kerr-Newman black holes as accelerators for spinning particles. We\nderive the center-of-mass energy of the spinning particles and use numerical\nmethod to investigate how the center-of-mass energy is affected by the\nproperties of the black holes and spinning particles.\n", "  We present an experimental and theoretical study of the optically detected\nmagnetic resonance signals for ensembles of negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy\n(NV) centers in 13C isotopically enriched single-crystal diamond. We observe\nfour broad transition peaks with superimposed sharp features at zero magnetic\nfield and study their dependence on applied magnetic field. A theoretical model\nthat reproduces all qualitative features of these spectra is developed.\nUnderstanding the magnetic-resonance spectra of NV centers in isotopically\nenriched diamond is important for emerging applications in nuclear magnetic\nresonance.\n", "  We study the decays of the pseudotensor mesons $[ \\pi_{2}(1670) , K_{2}(1770)\n, \\eta_{2}(1645) , \\eta_{2}(1870) ]$ interpreted as the ground-state nonet of\n$1^1 D_{2}$ $\\bar{q}q$ states using interaction Lagrangians which couple them\nto pseudoscalar, vector, and tensor mesons. While the decays of $\\pi_2 (1670)$\nand $K_2 (1770)$ can be well described, the decays of the isoscalar states\n$\\eta_2 (1645)$ and $\\eta_2 (1870)$ can be brought in agreement with\nexperimental data only if the mixing angle between nonstrange and strange\nstates is surprisingly large (about $-42^\\circ$, similar to the mixing in the\npseudoscalar sector, in which the chiral anomaly is active). Such a large\nmixing angle is however at odd with all other conventional quark-antiquark\nnonets: if confirmed, a deeper study of its origin will be needed in the\nfuture. Moreover, the $\\bar{q}q$ assignment of pseudotensor states predicts\nthat the ratio $[ \\eta_2 (1870) \\rightarrow a_2 (1320) \\pi]/[\\eta_2 (1870)\n\\rightarrow f_2 (1270) \\eta]$ is about $23.5$. This value is in agreement with\nBarberis et al., ($20.4 \\pm 6.6$), but disagrees with the recent reanalysis of\nAnisovich et al., ($1.7 \\pm 0.4$). Future experimental studies are necessary to\nunderstand this puzzle. If Anisovich's value shall be confirmed, a simple nonet\nof pseudoscalar mesons cannot be able to describe data (different assignments\nand/or additional state, such as an hybrid state, will be needed). In the end,\nwe also evaluate the decays of a pseudoscalar glueball into the aforementioned\nconventional $\\bar{q}q$ states: a sizable decay into $K^\\ast_2 (1430) K$ and\n$a_2 (1230) \\pi$ together with a vanishing decay into pseudoscalar-vector pairs\n[such as $\\rho(770) \\pi$ and $K^\\ast (892) K$] are expected. This information\ncan be helpful in future studies of glueballs at the ongoing BESIII and at the\nfuture PANDA experiments.\n", "  Our main interest in creating a secondary high-quality KL-beam is to\ninvestigate hyperon spectroscopy through both formation and production\nprocesses. We propose to study two-body reactions induced by the KL-beam on the\nproton target. The experiment should measure both differential cross sections\nand self-analyzed polarizations of the produced $\\Lambda$-, $\\Sigma$-, and\n$\\Xi$-hyperons using the GlueX detector at the Jefferson Lab Hall D. New data\nwill greatly constrain partial-wave analysis and reduce model-dependent\nuncertainties in the extraction of strange resonance properties, providing a\nnew benchmark for comparisons with QCD-inspired models and LQCD calculations.\nThe measurements will span c.m. $\\cos\\theta$ from -0.95 to 0.95 in c.m. range\nabove W = 1490MeV and up to 4000 MeV.\n", "  In the present paper we will discuss the Faddeev-Jackiw symplectic approach\nin the analysis of a charged compressible fluid immersed in a higher-derivative\nelectromagnetic field theory. We have obtained the full set of constraints\ndirectly from the zero-mode eigenvectors. Besides, we have computed the Dirac\nbrackets for the dynamic variables of the compressible fluid. Finally, as a\nresult of the coupling between the charged compressible fluid and the\nelectromagnetic field we have calculated two Dirac brackets between the fluid\nand electromagnetic fields, which are both zero when there is no coupling\nbetween them.\n", "  We introduce two new graphical-level relations among possible contributions\nto the four-point correlation function and scattering amplitude in planar,\nmaximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. When combined with the rung rule,\nthese prove powerful enough to fully determine both functions through ten\nloops. This then also yields the full five-point amplitude to eight loops and\nthe parity-even part to nine loops. We derive these rules, illustrate their\napplications, compare their relative strengths for fixing coefficients, and\nsurvey some of the features of the previously unknown nine and ten loop\nexpressions. Explicit formulae for amplitudes and correlators through ten loops\nare available at: http://goo.gl/JH0yEc.\n", "  The AdS/CFT correspondence provides quantum theories of gravity in which\nspacetime and gravitational physics emerge from ordinary non-gravitational\nquantum systems with many degrees of freedom. Recent work in this context has\nuncovered fascinating connections between quantum information theory and\nquantum gravity, suggesting that spacetime geometry is directly related to the\nentanglement structure of the underlying quantum mechanical degrees of freedom\nand that aspects of spacetime dynamics (gravitation) can be understood from\nbasic quantum information theoretic constraints. In these notes, we provide an\nelementary introduction to these developments, suitable for readers with some\nbackground in general relativity and quantum field theory. The notes are based\non lectures given at the CERN Spring School 2014, the Jerusalem Winter School\n2014, the TASI Summer School 2015, and the Trieste Spring School 2015.\n", "  The inner regions of the solar corona from 1-2.5 Rsun are poorly sampled both\nfrom the ground and space telescopes. A solar eclipse reduces the sky scattered\nbackground intensity by a factor of about 10,000 and opens a window to view\nthis region directly. The goal of the Citizen {\\it Continental-America\nTelescopic Eclipse} (CATE) Experiment is to take a 90-minute time sequence of\ncalibrated white light images of this coronal region using 60 identical\ntelescopes spread from Oregon to South Carolina during the 21 August 2017 total\nsolar eclipse. Observations that can address questions of coronal dynamics in\nthis region can be collected with rather modest telescope equipment, but the\nlarge dynamic range of the coronal brightness requires careful camera control.\nThe instruments used for test runs on the Faroe Islands in 2015 and at five\nsites in Indonesia in 2016 are described. Intensity calibration of the coronal\nimages is done and compared with previous eclipse measurements from November \\&\nKoutchmy (1996) and Bazin et al. (2015). The change of coronal brightness with\ndistance from the Sun seen in the 2016 eclipse agrees with observations from\nthe 1991 eclipse but differ substantially from the 2010 eclipse. The 2015\nobservations agree with 2016 and 1991 solar radii near the Sun, but are fainter\nat larger distances. Problems encountered during these test runs are discussed\nas well the solutions which will be implemented for the 2017 eclipse\nexperiment.\n", "  By using first-principles methods based on density functional theory we\nrevisited the zero-temperature phase diagram of stoichiometric SrCoO3, a\nferromagnetic metallic perovskite that undergoes significant structural,\nelectronic, and magnetic changes as its content of oxygen is decreased. We\nconsidered both bulk and epitaxial thin film geometries. In the bulk case, we\nfound that a tetragonal P4/mbm phase with moderate Jahn-Teller distortions and\nc/a ratio of ~1/sqrt{2} is consistently predicted to have a lower energy than\nthe thus far assumed ground-state cubic Pm-3m phase. In thin films, we found\ntwo phase transitions occurring at compressive and tensile epitaxial strains.\nHowever, in contrast to previous theoretical predictions, our results show\nthat: (i) the phase transition induced by tensile strain is isostructural and\ninvolves only a change in magnetic spin order (that is, not a metallic to\ninsulator transformation), and (ii) the phase transition induced by compressive\nstrain comprises simultaneous structural, electronic and magnetic spin order\nchanges, but the required epitaxial stress is so large (<-6%) that is unlikely\nto be observed in practice. Our findings call for a revision of the\ncrystallographic analysis performed in fully oxidised SrCoO3 samples at low\ntemperatures, as well as of previous first-principles studies.\n", "  We investigated the actuation performances of anisotropic gels driven by\nmechanical and chemical stimuli, in terms of both deformation processes and\nstroke--curves, and distinguished between the fast response of gels before\ndiffusion starts and the asymptotic response attained at the steady state. We\nalso showed as the range of forces that an anisotropic hydrogel can exert when\nconstrained is especially wide;indeed, changing fiber orientation allows to\ninduce shear as well as transversely isotropic extensions.\n", "  We present a numerical study of the behaviour of two magnetic dipolar atoms\ntrapped in a harmonic potential and exhibiting the standard Einstein-de Haas\neffect while subject to a time dependent homogeneous magnetic field. Using a\nsimplified description of the short range interaction and the full expression\nfor the dipole-dipole forces we show, that under experimentally realisable\nconditions two dysprosium atoms may be pumped to a high ($l>20$) value of the\nrelative orbital angular momentum.\n", "  We employ two Tight-Binding (TB) approaches to study the electronic structure\nand hole or electron transfer in B-DNA monomer polymers and dimer polymers made\nup of $N$ monomers (base pairs): (I) at the base-pair level, using the on-site\nenergies of base pairs and the hopping integrals between successive base pairs,\ni.e., a wire model and (II) at the single-base level, using the on-site\nenergies of the bases and the hopping integrals between neighboring bases,\ni.e., an \\textit{extended} ladder model since we also include diagonal\nhoppings. We solve a system of $MD$ (\"matrix dimension\") coupled equations [(I)\n$MD$ = $N$, (II) $MD$ = $2N$] for the time-independent problem, and a system of\n$MD$ coupled $1^\\text{st}$ order differential equations for the time-dependent\nproblem. We study the HOMO and the LUMO eigenspectra, the occupation\nprobabilities, the Density of States (DOS) and the HOMO-LUMO gap as well as the\nmean over time probabilities to find the carrier at each site [(I) base pair or\n(II) base)], the Fourier spectra, which reflect the frequency content of charge\ntransfer (CT) and the pure mean transfer rates from a certain site to another.\nThe two TB approaches give coherent, complementary aspects of electronic\nproperties and charge transfer in B-DNA monomer polymers and dimer polymers.\n", "  The description of heteropairs like $^{40}$K-$^6$Li near and in the\nsuperconducting state requires a fully selfconsistent theory [see Hanai and\nOhashi, Phys. Rev. A 90, 043622 (2014)]. We derive analytic pseudogap Green's\nfunctions for the \"normal\" and superconducting states from the Luttinger-Ward\ntheory with the T-matrix in the static separable approximation. The\nself-consistency in the closing loop of self-energy has two pronounced effects\non the single-particle spectrum. First, the single-particle excitations decay\nbefore the asymptotic quasiparticle propagation is established, therefore the\nnormal state is not a Fermi liquid. Second, the pseudogap has a V shape even\nfor s-wave pairing. The V-shaped pseudogap and the U-shaped BCS gap interfere\nresulting in slope breaks of the gap walls and the in-gap states in the density\nof states. Various consequences of an incomplete self-consistency are\ndemonstrated.\n", "  The harmonic oscillator with a time-dependent frequency has a family of\nlinear quantum invariants for the time-dependent Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation,\nwhich are determined by any two independent solutions to the classical equation\nof motion. Ermakov and Pinney have shown that a general solution to the\ntime-dependent oscillator with an inverse cubic term can be expressed in terms\nof two independent solutions to the time-dependent oscillator. We explore the\nconnection between linear quantum invariants and the Ermakov-Pinney solution\nfor the time-dependent harmonic oscillator. We advance a novel method to\nconstruct Ermakov-Pinney solutions to a class of time-dependent oscillators and\nthe wave functions for the time-dependent Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation. We further\nshow that the first and the second P\\\"{o}schl-Teller potentials belong to a\nspecial class of exact time-dependent oscillators. A perturbation method is\nproposed for any slowly-varying time-dependent frequency.\n", "  The phase transformation kinetics of\nLaFe$_{11.41}$Mn$_{0.30}$Si$_{1.29}$-H$_{1.65}$ magnetocaloric compound is\naddressed by low rate calorimetry experiments. Scans at 1 mK/s show that its\nfirst order phase transitions are made by multiple heat fllux avalanches.\nGetting very close to the critical point, the step-like discontinuous behavior\nassociated with avalanches is smoothed out and thermal hysteresis disappears.\nThis result is confirmed by magneto-resistivity measurements and allows to\nmeasure accurate values of the zero field hysteresis ($\\Delta T_{hyst}$ = 0.37\nK) and of the critical field (H$_c$ = 1.19 T). The number and magnitude of heat\nflux avalanches change with magnetic field, showing the interplay between the\nintrinsic energy barrier between phases and the microstructural disorder of the\nsample.\n", "  The nature of the dynamical quantum phase transition between the many-body\nlocalized (MBL) phase and the thermal phase remains an open question, and one\nline of attack on this problem is to explore this transition numerically in\nfinite-size systems. To maximize the contrast between the MBL phase and the\nthermal phase in such finite-size systems, we argue one should choose a Floquet\nmodel with no local conservation laws and rapid thermalization to \"infinite\ntemperature\" in the thermal phase. Here we introduce and explore such a Floquet\nspin chain model, and show that standard diagnostics of the MBL-to-thermal\ntransition behave well in this model even at modest sizes. We also introduce a\nphysically motivated spacetime correlation function which peaks at the\ntransition in the Floquet model, but is strongly affected by conservation laws\nin Hamiltonian models.\n", "  Context: After the loss of a second reaction wheel the Kepler mission was\nredesigned as the K2 mission, pointing towards the ecliptic and delivering data\nfor new fields approximately every 80 days. The steady flow of data obtained\nwith a reduced pointing stability calls for dedicated pipelines for extracting\nlight curves and correcting these for use in, e.g., asteroseismic analysis.\nAims: We provide corrected light curves for the K2 fields observed until now\n(campaigns 0-4), and provide a comparison with other pipelines for K2 data\nextraction/correction. Methods: Raw light curves are extracted from K2 pixel\ndata using the \"K2-pixel-photometry\" (K2P$^2$) pipeline, and corrected using\nthe KASOC filter. Results: The use of K2P$^2$ allows for the extraction of the\norder of 90.000 targets in addition to 70.000 targets proposed by the community\n- for these, other pipelines provide no data. We find that K2P$^2$ in general\nperforms as well as, or better than, other pipelines for the tested metrics of\nphotometric quality. In addition to stars, pixel masks are properly defined\nusing K2P$^2$ for extended objects such as galaxies for which light curves are\nalso extracted.\n", "  One-dimensional billiard, i.e. a chain of colliding particles with equal\nmasses, is well-known example of completely integrable system. Billiards with\ndifferent particles are generically not integrable, but still exhibit\ndivergence of a heat conduction coefficient (HCC) in thermodynamic limit.\nTraditional billiard models imply instantaneous (zero-time) collisions between\nthe particles. We lift this condition and consider the heat transport in a\nchain of stiff colliding particles with power-law potential of the\nnearest-neighbor interaction. The instantaneous collisions correspond to the\nlimit of infinite power in the interaction potential; for finite powers, the\ninteractions take nonzero time. This modification of the model leads to\nprofound physical consequence -- probability of multiple, in particular, triple\nparticle collisions becomes nonzero. Contrary to the integrable billiard of\nequal particles, the modified model exhibits saturation of the heat conduction\ncoefficient for large system size. Moreover, identification of scattering\nevents with the triple particle collisions leads to simple definition of\ncharacteristic mean free path and kinetic description of the heat transport.\nThis approach allows prediction both of temperature and density dependencies\nfor the HCC limit values. The latter dependence is quite counterintuitive - the\nHCC is inversely proportional to the particle density in the chain. Both\npredictions are confirmed by direct numeric simulations.\n", "  Using two-nucleon and three-nucleon interactions derived in the framework of\nchiral perturbation theory (ChPT) with and without the explicit $\\Delta$ isobar\ncontributions, we calculate the energy per particle of symmetric nuclear matter\nand pure neutron matter in the framework of the microscopic\nBrueckner-Hartree-Fock approach. In particular, we present for the first time\nnuclear matter calculations using the new fully local in coordinate-space\ntwo-nucleon interaction at the next-to-next-to-next-to-leading-order (N3LO) of\nChPT with $\\Delta$ isobar intermediate states (N3LO$\\Delta$) recently developed\nby Piarulli et al. [arXiv:1606:06335]. We find that using this N3LO$\\Delta$\npotential, supplemented with a local N2LO three-nucleon interaction with\nexplicit $\\Delta$ isobar degrees of freedom, it is possible to obtain a\nsatisfactory saturation point of symmetric nuclear matter. For this combination\nof two- and three-nucleon interactions we also calculate the nuclear symmetry\nenergy and we compare our results with the empirical constraints on this\nquantity obtained using the excitation energies to isobaric analog states in\nnuclei and using experimental data on the neutron skin thickness of heavy\nnuclei, finding a very good agreement with these empirical constraints in all\nthe considered nucleonic density range. In addition, we find that the explicit\ninclusion of $\\Delta$ isobars diminishes the strength of the three-nucleon\ninteractions needed the get a good saturation point of symmetric nuclear\nmatter. We also compare the results of our calculations with those obtained by\nother research groups using chiral nuclear interactions with different\nmany-body methods, finding in many cases a very satisfactory agreement.\n", "  We demonstrate that the use of analytical on-shell methods involving\ncalculation of the discontinuity across the t-channel cut associated with the\nexchange of a pair of massless particles (photons or gravitons) can be used to\nevaluate one-loop contributions to electromagnetic and gravitational\nscattering, with and without polarizability, reproducing via simple algebraic\nmanipulations, results obtained previously, generally using Feynman diagram\ntechniques. In the gravitational case the use of factorization permits a\nstraightforward and algebraic calculation of higher order scattering without\nconsideration of ghost contributions or of triple-graviton couplings, which\nmade previous evaluations considerably more arduous.\n", "  Planning to explore the beginning of the Universe? A lightweight introductory\nguide to the theory of Inflation.\n", "  We discuss the equivalence between light-front time-ordered-perturbation\ntheory and covariant quantum field theory in light-front quantization, in the\ncase of quantum electrodynamics at one-loop level. In particular, we review the\none-loop calculation of the vertex correction, fermion self-energy and vacuum\npolarization. We apply the procedure of integration by residue over the\nlight-front energy in the loop to show how the perturbative expansion in\ncovariant terms can be reduced to a sum of propagating and instantaneous\ndiagrams of light-front time-ordered perturbation theory. The detailed proof of\nequivalence between the two formulations of the theory resolves the\ncontroversial question on which form should be used for the gauge-field\npropagator in the light-cone gauge in the covariant approach.\n", "  We report on the first singly-resonant (SR), synchronously pumped optical\nparametric oscillator (OPO) based on orientation-patterned gallium arsenide\n(OP-GaAs). Together with a doubly resonant (DR) degenerate OPO based on the\nsame OP-GaAs material, the output spectra cover 3 to 6 ${\\mu}$m within ~3 dB of\nrelative power. The DR-OPO has the highest output power reported to date from a\nfemtosecond, synchronously pumped OPO based on OP-GaAs. We discovered strong\nthree photon absorption with a coefficient of 0.35 ${\\pm}$ 0.06\ncm${^3}$/GW${^2}$ for our OP-GaAs sample, which limits the output power of\nthese OPOs as mid-IR light sources. We present a detailed study of the three\nphoton loss on the performance of both the SR and DR-OPOs, and compare them to\nthose without this loss mechanism.\n", "  Here we present the theory of the conductivity of pn junction (pnJ) in\ngraphene channel, placed on ferroelectric substrate, caused by ferroelectric\ndomain wall (FDW) for the case of arbitrary current regime: from ballistic to\ndiffusive one. We calculated the ratio of the pnJ conductions for opposite\npolarities of voltages, applied to source and drain electrodes of the\nchannel,G+/G- as the function of the graphene channel length L, electron mean\nfree path {\\lambda} and ferroelectric substrate permittivity. We have\ndemonstrated, that the small values of G+/G-(0.1 and smaller), which correspond\nto efficient graphene pnJ based rectifier, can be obtained for the\nferroelectrics with high and for the ratios of L/{\\lambda}~1 or smaller.\nHowever, for ferroelectrics with extremely high permittivity(relaxor or\nPbZrxTi1-xO3 with composition x near the morphotropic phase boundary x=0.52)\nthe ratio G+/G- can be essentially smaller then unity for the case of a\npronounced diffusive regime of current as well. This makes the ferroelectric\nsubstrates with high permittivity excellent candidates for the fabrication of\nnew generation of rectifiers based on the graphene pnJ. Temperature effect on\nratio was studied within Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire approach. We have\ndemonstrated that rectifying properties of the graphene pnJ become better in\nthe vicinity of Curie temperature. However, for the temperatures higher than\nCurie temperature the rectifying effect vanishes due to the ferroelectric\npolarization disappearance.\n", "  We analyze velocity fluctuations inside coherent vortices generated as a\nresult of the inverse cascade in the two-dimensional ($2d$) turbulence in a\nfinite box. As we demonstrated in \\cite{16KL}, the universal velocity profile,\nestablished in \\cite{14LBFKL}, corresponds to the passive regime of flow\nfluctuations. The property enables one to calculate correlation functions of\nthe velocity fluctuations in the universal region. We present results of the\ncalculations that demonstrate a non-trivial scaling of the structure function.\nIn addition the calculations reveal strong anisotropy of the structure\nfunction.\n", "  Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are highly dispersed, sporadic radio pulses that are\nlikely extragalactic in nature. Here we investigate the constraints on the\nsource population from surveys carried out at frequencies $<1$~GHz. All but one\nFRB has so far been discovered in the 1--2~GHz band, but new and emerging\ninstruments look set to become valuable probes of the FRB population at sub-GHz\nfrequencies in the near future. In this paper, we consider the impacts of\nfree-free absorption and multi-path scattering in our analysis via a number of\ndifferent assumptions about the intervening medium. We consider previous low\nfrequency surveys alongwith an ongoing survey with the University of Technology\ndigital backend for the Molonglo Observatory Synthesis Telescope (UTMOST) as\nwell as future observations with the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping\nExperiment (CHIME) and the Hydrogen Intensity and Real-Time Analysis Experiment\n(HIRAX). We predict that CHIME and HIRAX will be able to observe $\\sim$ 30 or\nmore FRBs per day, even in the most extreme scenarios where free-free\nabsorption and scattering can significantly impact the fluxes below 1~GHz. We\nalso show that UTMOST will detect 1--2 FRBs per month of observations. For\nCHIME and HIRAX, the detection rates also depend greatly on the assumed FRB\ndistance scale. Some of the models we investigated predict an increase in the\nFRB flux as a function of redshift at low frequencies. If FRBs are truly\ncosmological sources, this effect may impact future surveys in this band,\nparticularly if the FRB population traces the cosmic star formation rate.\n", "  We consider, in the harmonic superspace approach, the six-dimensional N=(1,0)\nsupersymmetric model of abelian gauge multiplet coupled to a hypermultiplet.\nThe superficial degree of divergence is evaluated and the structure of possible\none-loop divergences is analyzed. Using the superfield proper-time and\nbackground-field technique, we compute the divergent part of the one-loop\neffective action depending on both the gauge multiplet and the hypermultiplet.\nThe corresponding counterterms contain the purely gauge multiplet contribution\ntogether with the mixed contributions of the gauge multiplet and\nhypermultiplet. We show that the theory is on-shell one-loop finite in the\ngauge multiplet sector in agreement with the results of [1]. The divergences in\nthe mixed sector cannot be eliminated by any field redefinition, implying the\ntheory to be UV divergent at one loop.\n", "  While two-dimensional symmetry-enriched topological phases ($\\mathsf{SET}$s)\nhave been studied intensively and systematically, three-dimensional ones are\nstill open issues. We propose an algorithmic approach of imposing global\nsymmetry $G_s$ on gauge theories (denoted by $\\mathsf{GT}$) with gauge group\n$G_g$. The resulting symmetric gauge theories are dubbed \"symmetry-enriched\ngauge theories\" ($\\mathsf{SEG}$), which may be served as low-energy effective\ntheories of three-dimensional symmetric topological quantum spin liquids. We\nfocus on $\\mathsf{SEG}$s with gauge group\n$G_g=\\mathbb{Z}_{N_1}\\times\\mathbb{Z}_{N_2}\\times\\cdots$ and on-site unitary\nsymmetry group $G_s=\\mathbb{Z}_{K_1}\\times\\mathbb{Z}_{K_2}\\times\\cdots$ or\n$G_s=\\mathrm{U(1)}\\times \\mathbb{Z}_{K_1}\\times\\cdots$. Each\n$\\mathsf{SEG}(G_g,G_s)$ is described in the path integral formalism associated\nwith certain symmetry assignment. From the path-integral expression, we propose\nhow to physically diagnose the ground state properties (i.e., $\\mathsf{SET}$\norders) of $\\mathsf{SEG}$s in experiments of charge-loop braidings (patterns of\nsymmetry fractionalization) and the \\emph{mixed} multi-loop braidings among\ndeconfined loop excitations and confined symmetry fluxes. From these\nsymmetry-enriched properties, one can obtain the map from $\\mathsf{SEG}$s to\n$\\mathsf{SET}$s. By giving full dynamics to background gauge fields,\n$\\mathsf{SEG}$s may be eventually promoted to a set of new gauge theories\n(denoted by $\\mathsf{GT}^*$). Based on their gauge groups, $\\mathsf{GT}^*$s may\nbe further regrouped into different classes each of which is labeled by a gauge\ngroup ${G}^*_g$. Finally, a web of gauge theories involving $\\mathsf{GT}$,\n$\\mathsf{SEG}$, $\\mathsf{SET}$ and $\\mathsf{GT}^*$ is achieved. We demonstrate\nthe above symmetry-enrichment physics and the web of gauge theories through\nmany concrete examples.\n", "  We investigate the branching ratios, the polarization fractions, the direct\nCP-violating asymmetries, and the relative phases in 20 nonleptonic decay modes\nof $B \\to f_1 V$ within the framework of perturbative QCD approach at leading\norder with $f_1$ including two $^3\\!P_1$-axial-vector states $f_1(1285)$ and\n$f_1(1420)$. Here, $B$ denotes $B^+$, $B^0$, and $B_s^0$ mesons and $V$ stands\nfor the lightest vector mesons $\\rho$, $K^*$, $\\omega$, and $\\phi$ ,\nrespectively. The $B_s^0 \\to f_1 V$ decays are studied theoretically for the\nfirst time in the literature. Together with the angle $\\phi_{f_1} \\approx\n(24^{+3.2}_{-2.7})^\\circ$ extracted from the measurement through $B_{d/s} \\to\nJ/\\psi f_1(1285)$ modes for the $f_1(1285)-f_1(1420)$ mixing system, it is of\ngreat interest to find phenomenologically some modes such as the tree-dominated\n$B^+ \\to f_1 \\rho^+$ and the penguin-dominated $B^{+,0} \\to f_1 K^{*+,0}, B_s^0\n\\to f_1 \\phi$ with large branching ratios around ${\\cal O}(10^{-6})$ or even\n${\\cal O}(10^{-5})$, which are expected measurable at the LHCb and/or the\nBelle-II experiments in the near future. The good agreement [sharp contrast] of\nbranching ratios and decay pattern for $B^+ \\to f_1 \\rho^+, B^{+,0} \\to\nf_1(1285) K^{*+,0} [B^{+,0} \\to f_1(1420) K^{*+,0}]$ decays between QCD\nfactorization and perturbative QCD factorization predictions can help us to\ndistinguish these two rather different factorization approaches via precision\nmeasurements, which would also be helpful for us to explore the annihilation\ndecay mechanism through its important roles for the considered $B \\to f_1 V$\ndecays.\n", "  New results on exclusive hadron production in $e^+e^-$ annihilation obtained\nin experiments with the SND detector at the VEPP-2M and VEPP-2000 $e^+e^-$\ncolliders are presented.\n", "  Stationary features are occasionally observed in AGN jets. A notable example\nis the HST-1 knot in M87. Such features are commonly interpreted as\nre-confinement shocks in hydrodynamic jets or focusing nozzles in Poynting\njets. In this paper we compute the structure and Lorentz factor of a highly\nmagnetized jet confined by external pressure having a profile that flattens\nabruptly at some radius. We find the development of strong oscillations upon\ntransition from the steeper to the flatter pressure profile medium. Analytic\nformula is derived for the location of the nodes of these oscillations. We\napply the model to the M87 jet and show that if the jet remains magnetically\ndominated up to sub-kpc scales, then focusing is expected. The location of the\nHST-1 knot can be reconciled with recent measurements of the pressure profile\naround the Bondi radius if the jet luminosity satisfies $L_j\\simeq10^{43}$\nerg/s. However, we find that magnetic domination at the collimation break\nimplies a Lorentz factor in excess of $10^2$, atypical to FRI sources. A much\nlower value of the asymptotic Lorentz factor would require substantial loading\nclose to the black hole. In that case HST-1 may be associated with a\ncollimation nozzle of a hydrodynamic flow.\n", "  We characterise the physical nature of a 1.1 mm-selected, flux-limited, and\ninterferometrically followed up sample of SMGs in COSMOS. We used the MAGPHYS\ncode to fit the multiwavelength (UV-radio) SEDs of 16 of the target SMGs. We\nalso constructed the pure radio SEDs of our SMGs using three different radio\nbands (325 MHz, 1.4 GHz, and 3 GHz). Moreover, since two SMGs in our sample,\nAzTEC1 and AzTEC3, benefit from previous CO line observations, we studied their\nproperties in more detail. We found that 63% of our target SMGs lie above the\ngalaxy main-sequence by more than a factor of 3, and hence are starbursts. The\n3 GHz radio sizes we have previously measured for the target SMGs were compared\nwith the present stellar mass estimates, and we found that the z>3 SMGs are\nfairly consistent with the mass-size relationship of z~2 compact, quiescent\ngalaxies (cQGs). The median IR-radio correlation parameter is found to be\nq=2.27, which is lower than measured locally (median q=2.64). AzTEC1 is found\nto have a sub-Eddington SFR surface density (by a factor of 2.6), while AzTEC3\nappears to be an Eddington-limited starburster. The gas reservoir in these two\nhigh-z SMGs would be exhausted in only ~86 and 19 Myr at the current SFR,\nrespectively. A comparison of the MAGPHYS-based properties of our SMGs with\nthose of equally bright ALESS SMGs suggests that the two populations share\nfairly similar physical characteristics, including the q parameter. A hint of\nnegative correlation is found between the 3 GHz size and the level of\nstarburstiness, and hence cosmic-ray electrons in more compact starbursts might\nbe more susceptible to free-free absorption. Some of the derived low and high q\nvalues (compared to the local median) could be the result of a specific\nmerger/post-starburst phase of galaxy evolution. Overall, our results support\nthe scenario where z>3 SMGs evolve into today's giant ellipticals.\n", "  Aims: We aim to investigate how converging flows towards active regions\naffect the surface transport of magnetic flux, as well as their impact on the\ngeneration of the Sun's poloidal field. The inflows constitute a potential\nnon-linear mechanism for the saturation of the global dynamo and may contribute\nto the modulation of the solar cycle in the Babcock-Leighton framework.\n  Methods: We build a surface flux transport code incorporating a parametrized\nmodel of the inflows and run simulations spanning several cycles. We carry out\na parameter study to assess how the strength and extension of the inflows\naffect the build-up of the global dipole field. We also perform simulations\nwith different levels of activity to investigate the potential role of the\ninflows in the saturation of the global dynamo.\n  Results: We find that the interaction of neighbouring active regions can lead\nto the occasional formation of single-polarity magnetic flux clumps\ninconsistent with observations. We propose the darkening caused by pores in\nareas of high magnetic field strength as a plausible mechanism preventing this\nflux-clumping. We find that inflows decrease the amplitude of the axial dipole\nmoment by a $\\sim30\\,\\%$, relative to a no-inflows scenario. Stronger (weaker)\ninflows lead to larger (smaller) reductions of the axial dipole moment. The\nrelative amplitude of the generated axial dipole is about $9\\%$ larger after\nvery weak cycles than after very strong cycles. This supports the inflows as a\nnon-linear mechanism capable of saturating the global dynamo and contributing\nto the modulation of the solar cycle within the Babcock-Leighton framework.\n", "  Precision calculations of heavy-to-light form factors are essential to\nsharpen our understanding towards the strong interaction dynamics of the\nheavy-quark system and to shed light on a coherent solution of flavor\nanomalies. We briefly review factorization properties of heavy-to-light form\nfactors in the framework of QCD factorization in the heavy quark limit and\ndiscuss the recent progress on the QCD calculation of $B \\to \\pi$ form factors\nfrom the light-cone sum rules with the $B$-meson distribution amplitudes.\nDemonstration of QCD factorization for the vacuum-to-$B$-meson correlation\nfunction used in the sum-rule construction and resummation of large logarithms\nin the short-distance functions entering the factorization theorem are\npresented in detail. Phenomenological implications of the newly derived sum\nrules for $B \\to \\pi$ form factors are further addressed with a particular\nattention to the extraction of the CKM matrix element $|V_{ub}|$.\n", "  We extend the Keldysh technique to enable the computation of out-of-time\norder correlators. We show that the behavior of these correlators is described\nby equations that display initially an exponential instability which is\nfollowed by a linear propagation of the decoherence between two initially\nidentically copies of the quantum many body systems with interactions. At large\ntimes the decoherence propagation (quantum butterfly effect) is described by a\ndiffusion equation with non-linear dissipation known in the theory of\ncombustion waves. The solution of this equation is a propagating non-linear\nwave moving with constant velocity despite the diffusive character of the\nunderlying dynamics. Our general conclusions are illustrated by the detailed\ncomputations for the specific models describing the electrons interacting with\nbosonic degrees of freedom (phonons, two-level-systems etc.) or with each\nother.\n", "  A mechanism for addressing the 'decompactification problem' is proposed,\nwhich consists of balancing the vacuum energy in Scherk-Schwarzed theories\nagainst contributions coming from non- perturbative physics. Universality of\nthreshold corrections ensures that, in such situations, the stable minimum will\nhave consistent gauge couplings for any gauge group that shares the same N = 2\nbeta function for the bulk excitations as the gauge group that takes part in\nthe minimisation. Scherk- Schwarz compactification from 6D to 4D in heterotic\nstrings is discussed explicitly, together with two alternative possibilities\nfor the non-perturbative physics, namely metastable SQCD vacua and a single\ngaugino condensate. In the former case, it is shown that modular symmetries\ngives various consistency checks, and allow one to follow soft-terms, playing a\nsimilar role to R-symmetry in global SQCD. The latter case is particularly\nattractive when there is nett Bose-Fermi degeneracy in the massless sector. In\nsuch cases, because the original Casimir energy is generated entirely by\nexcited and/or non-physical string modes, it is completely immune to the\nnon-perturbative IR physics. The large separation between UV and IR\ncontributions to the potential greatly simplifies the analysis of\nstabilisation, and is a general possibility that has not been considered\nbefore.\n", "  We calculate all neutral vector two-point functions in Chiral Perturbation\nTheory (ChPT) to two-loop order and use these to estimate the ratio of\ndisconnected to connected contributions as well as contributions involving the\nstrange quark. We extend the ratio of $-1/10$ derived earlier in two flavour\nChPT at one-loop order to a large part of the higher order contributions and\ndiscuss corrections to it. Our final estimate of the ratio disconnected to\nconnected is negative and a few % in magnitude.\n", "  In the configuration in which two-level atoms with an initial thermal\ndistribution of their states are sent in succession to a cavity sustaining a\nsingle mode of electromagnetic radiation, one atom leaving the cavity as the\nnext one enters it (as in the one-atom maser), Jaynes and Cummings showed that\nthe steady state of the field, when many atoms have traversed the cavity, is\nthermal with a temperature different than that of the atoms in the off-resonant\nsituation. Having an interaction between two subsystems which maintains them at\ndifferent temperatures was then understood as leading to an apparent violation\nof energy conservation. Here we show, by calculating the quantum entropy\nproduction in the system, that this difference of temperatures is consistent\nwith having the subsystems adiabatically insulated from each other as the\nsteady state is approached. At resonance the insulation is removed and\nequilibration of the temperatures is achieved.\n", "  We discuss static spherically symmetric metrics which represent non-singular\nblack holes in four- and higher-dimensional spacetime. We impose a set of\nrestrictions, such as a regularity of the metric at the center $r=0$ and\nSchwarzschild asymptotic behavior at large $r$. We assume that the metric\nbesides mass $M$ contains an additional parameter $\\ell$, which determines the\nscale where modification of the solution of the Einstein equations becomes\nsignificant. We require that the modified metric obeys the limiting curvature\ncondition, that is its curvature is uniformly restricted by the value $\\sim\n\\ell^{-2}$. We also make a \"more technical\" assumption that the metric\ncoefficients are rational functions of $r$. In particular, the invariant\n$(\\nabla r)^2$ has the form $P_n(r)/\\tilde{P}_n(r)$, where $P_n$ and\n$\\tilde{P}_n$ are polynomials of the order of $n$. We discuss first the case of\nfour dimensions. We show that when $n\\le 2$ such a metric cannot describe a\nnon-singular black hole. For $n=3$ we find a suitable metric, which besides $M$\nand $\\ell$ contains a dimensionless numerical parameter. When this parameter\nvanishes the obtained metric coincides with Hayward's one. The characteristic\nproperty of such spacetimes is $-\\xi^2=(\\nabla r)^2$, where $\\xi^2$ is a\ntime-like at infinity Killing vector. We describe a possible generalization of\na non-singular black-hole metric to the case when this equality is violated. We\nalso obtain a metric for a charged non-singular black hole obeying similar\nrestrictions as the neutral one, and construct higher dimensional models of\nneutral and charged black holes.\n", "  We carried out a millimeter wavelength line survey between 79 and 356 GHz\nwith the IRAM-30m telescope to investigate the physical and chemical properties\nof the molecular envelope of the oxygen-rich AGB star IK Tau. We analysed the\nmolecular lines detected using the population diagram technique to derive\nrotational temperatures and column densities. Additionally, we conducted a\nradiative transfer analysis of the SO$_2$ lines detected. For the first time in\nthis source we detected rotational lines in the ground vibrational state of\nHCO$^+$, NS, NO, and H$_2$CO, as well as several isotopologues of molecules\npreviously identified. We also detected several rotational lines in\nvibrationally excited states of SiS and SiO isotopologues, and rotational lines\nof H$_2$O ($\\nu_{\\mathrm{2}}$=2). We have also increased the number of\nrotational lines detected of molecules that were previously identified,\nenabling a detailed study of the molecular abundances and excitation\ntemperatures. IK Tau displays a rich chemistry for an oxygen-rich circumstellar\nenvelope. We highlight the detection of NS and H$_2$CO with fractional\nabundances of f(NS)$\\sim$10$^{-8}$ and f(H$_2$CO)$\\sim$[10$^{-7}$--10$^{-8}$].\nMost of the molecules display rotational temperatures between 15 and 40 K. NaCl\nand SiS isotopologues display rotational temperatures higher than the average\n(~65 K). In the case of SO$_2$ a warm component with\n$T_{\\mathrm{rot}}$$\\sim$290 K is also detected. This SO$_2$ warm component is\nprobably arising from the inner regions of the envelope (at $\\sim$8$R_{*}$)\nwhere SO$_2$ has a fractional abundance of f(SO$_2$)$\\sim$10$^{-6}$. This\nresult should be considered for future investigation of the main formation\nchannels of this, and other, parent species in the inner winds of O-rich AGB\nstars, which at present are not well reproduced by current chemistry models.\n", "  This paper is concerned with theoretical estimates of the refractive--index\ncurves for quartz, obtained by the Kubo formul\\ae\\ in the classical\napproximation, through MD simulations for the motions of the ions. Two\nobjectives are considered. The first one is to understand the role of\nnonlinearities in situations where they are very large, as at the\n$\\alpha$--$\\beta$ structural phase transition. We show that on the one hand\nthey don't play an essential role in connection with the form of the spectra in\nthe infrared. On the other hand they play an essential role in introducing a\nchaoticity which involves a definite normal mode. This might explain why that\nmode is Raman active in the $\\alpha$ phase, but not in the $\\beta$ phase. The\nsecond objective concerns whether it is possible in a microscopic model to\nobtain normal mode frequencies, or peak frequencies in the optical spectra,\nthat are in good agreement with the experimental data for quartz.\nNotwithstanding a lot of effort, we were unable to find results agreeing better\nthan about 6%, as apparently also occurs in the whole available literature. We\ninterpret this fact as indicating that some essential qualitative feature is\nlacking in all models which consider, as the present one, only short--range\nrepulsive potentials and unretarded long--range electric forces.\n", "  Solitons play a fundamental role in dynamics of nonlinear excitations. Here\nwe explore the motion of solitons in one-dimensional uniform Bose-Einstein\ncondensates subjected to a spin-orbit coupling (SOC). We demonstrate that the\nspin dynamics of solitons is governed by a nonlinear Bloch equation. The spin\ndynamics influences the orbital motion of the solitons leading to the\nspin-orbit effects in the dynamics of the macroscopic quantum objects\n(mean-field solitons). The latter perform oscillations with a frequency\ndetermined by the SOC, Raman coupling, and intrinsic nonlinearity. These\nfindings reveal unique features of solitons affected by the SOC, which is\nconfirmed by analytical considerations and numerical simulations of the\nunderlying Gross-Pitaevskii equations.\n", "  The electrical Hall conductivities of any anisotropic interacting system with\nreflection symmetry obey sigma_{xy} = - sigma_{yx}. In contrast, we show that\nthe analogous relation between the transverse thermoelectric Peltier\ncoefficients, alpha_{xy}= - alpha_{yx}, does not generally hold in the same\nsystem. This fact may be traced to interaction contributions to the heat\ncurrent operator and the mixed nature of the thermoelectric response functions.\nRemarkably, however, it appears that emergence of quasiparticles at low\ntemperatures forces alpha_{xy} = - alpha_{yx}. This suggests that\nquasiparticle-free groundstates (so-called non-Fermi liquids) may be detected\nby examining the relationship between alpha_{xy} and alpha_{yx} in the presence\nof reflection symmetry and microscopic anisotropy. These conclusions are based\non the following results: (i) The relation between the Peltier coefficients is\nexact for elastically scattered noninteracting particles; (ii) It holds\napproximately within Boltzmann theory for interacting particles when elastic\nscattering dominates over inelastic processes. In a disordered Fermi liquid the\nlatter lead to deviations that vanish as T^3. (iii) We calculate the\nthermoelectric response in a model of weakly-coupled spin-gapped Luttinger\nliquids and obtain strong breakdown of antisymmetry between the off-diagonal\ncomponents of alpha. We also find that the Nernst signal in this model is\nenhanced by interactions and can change sign as function of magnetic field and\ntemperature.\n", "  We report a bright photon-pair source with a coincidence counting rate per\ninput power (cps/mW) of tens of thousands, obtained via spontaneous four-wave\nmixing from a Doppler-broadened atomic ensemble of the 5S1/2-5P3/2-5D5/2\ntransition of 87Rb. The photon-pair generation rate is enhanced by the\ntwo-photon coherence contributions from almost all the atomic velocity groups\nin the Doppler-broadened ladder-type atomic system. We obtained the violation\nof the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality by a factor of 2370(150). We believe that our\nscheme for highly bright paired photons is important as a useful quantum light\nsource for quantum entanglement swapping between completely autonomous sources.\n", "  Context: Gaps, cavities and rings in circumstellar disks are signposts of\ndisk evolution and planet-disk interactions. We follow the recent suggestion\nthat Herbig Ae/Be disks with a flared disk harbour a cavity, and investigate\nthe disk around HD~97048.\n  Aims: We aim to resolve the 34$\\pm$ 4 au central cavity predicted by Maaskant\net al. (2013) and to investigate the structure of the disk.\n  Methods: We image the disk around HD~97048 using ALMA at 0.85~mm and 2.94~mm,\nand ATCA (multiple frequencies) observations. Our observations also include the\n12CO J=1-0, 12CO J=3-2 and HCO+ J=4-3 emission lines.\n  Results: A central cavity in the disk around HD~97048 is resolved with a\n40-46 au radius. Additional radial structure present in the surface brightness\nprofile can be accounted for either by an opacity gap at ~90 au or by an extra\nemitting ring at ~150 au. The continuum emission tracing the dust in the disk\nis detected out to 355 au. The 12CO J=3-2 disk is detected 2.4 times farther\nout. The 12CO emission can be traced down to $\\approx$ 10 au scales.\nNon-Keplerian kinematics are detected inside the cavity via the HCO+ J=4-3\nvelocity map. The mm spectral index measured from ATCA observations suggests\nthat grain growth has occurred in the HD~97048 disk. Finally, we resolve a\nhighly inclined disk out to 150 au around the nearby 0.5~$M_{\\odot}$ binary\nISO-ChaI 126.\n  Conclusions: The data presented here reveal a cavity in the disk of HD 97048,\nand prominent radial structure in the surface brightness. The cavity size\nvaries for different continuum frequencies and gas tracers. The gas inside the\ncavity follows non-Keplerian kinematics seen in HCO+ emission. The variable\ncavity size along with the kinematical signature suggests the presence of a\nsubstellar companion or massive planet inside the cavity.\n", "  The volume of the region inside the bulk Ryu-Takayanagi surface is a\ncodimension-one object, and a natural generalization of holographic complexity\nto the case of subregions in the boundary QFT. We focus on time-independent\ngeometries, and study the properties of this volume in various circumstances.\nWe derive a formula for computing the volume for a strip entangling surface and\na general asymptotically AdS bulk geometry. For an AdS black hole geometry, the\nvolume exhibits non-monotonic behaviour as a function of the size of the\nentangling region (unlike the behaviour of the entanglement entropy in this\nsetup, which is monotonic). For setups in which the holographic entanglement\nentropy exhibits transitions in the bulk, such as global AdS black hole,\ngeometries dual to confining theories and disjoint entangling surfaces, the\ncorresponding volume exhibits a discontinuous finite jump at the transition\npoint (and so do the volumes of the corresponding entanglement wedges). We\ncompute this volume discontinuity in several examples. Lastly, we compute the\ncodim-zero volume and the bulk action of the entanglement wedge for the case of\na sphere entangling surface and pure AdS geometry.\n", "  We propose that the Yang-Baxter deformation of the symmetric space\nsigma-model parameterized by an r-matrix solving the homogeneous (classical)\nYang-Baxter equation is equivalent to the non-abelian dual of the undeformed\nmodel with respect to a subgroup determined by the structure of the r-matrix.\nWe explicitly demonstrate this on numerous examples in the case of the AdS_5\nsigma-model. The same should also be true for the full AdS_5 x S^5 supercoset\nmodel, providing an explanation for and generalizing several recent\nobservations relating homogeneous Yang-Baxter deformations based on non-abelian\nr-matrices to the undeformed AdS_5 x S^5 model by a combination of T-dualities\nand non-linear coordinate redefinitions. This also includes the special case of\ndeformations based on abelian r-matrices, which correspond to TsT\ntransformations: they are equivalent to non-abelian duals of the original model\nwith respect to a central extension of abelian subalgebras.\n", "  Nonlocal potential models have been used in place of the Coulomb potential in\nthe Schrodinger equation as an efficient means of exploring high field\nlaser-atom interaction in previous works. Al- though these models have found\nuse in modeling phenomena including photo-ionization and ejected electron\nmomentum spectra, they are known to break electromagnetic gauge invariance.\nThis paper examines if there is a preferred gauge for the linear field response\nand photoionization characteristics of nonlocal atomic binding potentials in\nthe length and velocity gauges. It is found that the length gauge is preferable\nfor a wide range of parameters.\n", "  Both the three-dimensional density of red clump giants and the gas kinematics\nin the inner Galaxy indicate that the pattern speed of the Galactic bar could\nbe much lower than previously estimated. Here, we show that such slow bar\nmodels are unable to reproduce the bimodality observed in local stellar\nvelocity space. We do so by computing the response of stars in the Solar\nneighbourhood to the gravitational potential of slow and fast bars, in terms of\ntheir perturbed distribution function in action-angle space up to second order,\nas well as by identifying resonantly trapped orbits. We also check that the\nbimodality is unlikely to be produced through perturbations from spiral arms,\nand conclude that, contrary to gas kinematics, local stellar kinematics still\nfavour a fast bar in the Milky Way, with a pattern speed of the order of almost\ntwice (and no less than 1.8 times) the circular frequency at the Sun's\nposition. This leaves open the question of the nature of the long flat\nextension of the bar in the Milky Way.\n", "  The large-$N$ limit of ABJM theory is holographically dual to M-theory on\nAdS$_4\\times S^7/\\mathbb{Z}_k$. The 3-sphere partition function has been\nobtained via localization, and its leading behavior $F_{\\text{ABJM}}^{(0)}\\sim\nk^{1/2}N^{3/2}$ is exactly reproduced in the dual theory by tree-level\nsupergravity. We extend this comparison to the sub-leading $\\mathcal O(N^0)$\norder by computing the one-loop supergravity free energy as a function of $k$\nand comparing it with the ABJM result. Curiously, we find that the expressions\ndo not match, with $F_{\\text{SUGRA}}^{(1)}\\sim k^6$, while\n$F_{\\text{ABJM}}^{(1)}\\sim k^2$. This suggests that the low-energy\napproximation $Z_{\\text{M-theory}}=Z_{\\text{SUGRA}}$ breaks down at one-loop\norder.\n", "  Using the duality between seemingly different (2+1)d conformal field theories\n(CFT) proposed recently, we study a series of (2+1)d stable self-dual\ninteracting CFTs. These CFTs can be realized (for instance) on the boundary of\nthe (3+1)d bosonic topological insulator protected by U(1) and time-reversal\nsymmetry, and they remain stable as long as these symmetries are preserved.\nWhen realized as a boundary system, these CFTs can be driven into anomalous\nfractional quantum Hall states once time-reversal is broken. We demonstrate\nthat the newly proposed dualities allow us to study these CFTs quantitatively\nthrough a controlled calculation, without relying on a large flavor number of\nmatter fields.\n", "  We report spatially resolved (FWHM$\\sim3.8-4.6\"$) mid-IR imaging observations\nof the planetary nebula (PN) NGC 7027 taken with the 2.5-m telescope aboard the\nStratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA). Images of NGC 7027\nwere acquired at 6.3, 6.6, 11.1, 19.7, 24.2, 33.6, and 37.1 $\\mu\\mathrm{m}$\nusing the Faint Object Infrared Camera for the SOFIA Telescope (FORCAST).The\nobservations reveal emission from Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon (PAH) and\nwarm dust ($T_D\\sim90$ K) from the illuminated inner edge of the molecular\nenvelope surrounding the ionized gas and central star. The DustEM code was used\nto fit the spectral energy distribution of fluxes obtained by FORCAST and the\narchival infrared spectrum of NGC 7027 acquired by the Short Wavelength\nSpectrometer (SWS) on the Infrared Space Observatory (ISO). Best-fit dust\nmodels provide a total dust mass of $5.8^{+2.3}_{-2.6}\\times10^{-3}$\n$\\mathrm{M}_\\odot$, where carbonaceous large ($a=1.5$ $\\mu$m) and very small\n($a \\sim12\\AA$) grains, and PAHs ($3.1\\AA<a<12\\AA$) compose 96.5, 2.2, and 1.3\n$\\%$ of the dust by mass, respectively. The 37 $\\mu$m optical depth map shows\nminima in the dust column density at regions in the envelope that are\ncoincident with a previously identified collimated outflow from the central\nstar. The optical depth minima are also spatially coincident with enhancements\nin the 6.2 $\\mu$m PAH feature, which is derived from the 6.3 and 6.6 $\\mu$m\nmaps. We interpret the spatial anti-correlation of the dust optical depth and\nPAH 6.2 $\\mu$m feature strength and their alignment with the outflow from the\ncentral star as evidence of dust processing and rapid PAH formation via\ngrain-grain collisions in the post-shock environment of the dense\n($n_H\\sim10^5\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$) photo-dissociation region (PDR) and molecular\nenvelope.\n", "  We present an extension of the functional renormalization group to Floquet\nspace, which enables us to treat the long time behavior of interacting time\nperiodically driven quantum dots. It is one of its strength that the method is\nneither bound to small driving amplitudes nor to small driving frequencies,\ni.e. very general time periodic signals can be considered. It is applied to the\ninteracting resonant level model, a prototype model of a spinless, fermionic\nquantum dot. The renormalization in several setups with different combinations\nof time periodic parameters is studied, where the numerical results are\ncomplemented by analytic expressions for the renormalization in the limit of\nsmall driving amplitude. We show how the driving frequency acts as an infrared\ncutoff of the underlying renormalization group flow which manifests in novel\npower laws. We utilize the tunability of the effective reservoir distribution\nfunction in a periodically driven onsite energy setup to show how its shape is\ndirectly reflected in the renormalization group flow. This allows to flexibly\ntune the power-law renormalization generically encountered in quantum dot\nstructures. Finally, an in-phase quantum pump as well as a single parameter\npump are investigated in the whole regime of driving frequency, demonstrating\nthat the new power law in the driving frequency is reflected in the mean\ncurrent of the latter.\n", "  We theoretically investigate the implementation of a quantum phase gate in a\nsystem constituted by a single atom inside an optical cavity, based on the\nelectromagnetically induced transparency effect. Firstly we show that a probe\npulse can experience a $\\pi$ phase shift due to the presence or absence of a\nclassical control field. Considering the interplay of the cavity-EIT effect and\nthe quantum memory process, we demonstrated a controlled phase gate between two\nsingle photons. To this end, firstly one needs to store a (control) photon in\nthe ground atomic states. In the following, a second (target) photon must\nimpinge on the atom-cavity system. Depending on the atomic state, this second\nphoton will be either transmitted or reflected, acquiring different phase\nshifts. This protocol can then be easily extended to multiphoton systems, i.e.,\nkeeping the control photon stored, it may induce phase shifts in several single\nphotons, thus enabling the generation of multipartite entangled states. We\nexplore the relevant parameter space in the atom-cavity system that allows the\nimplementation of quantum phase gates using the recent technologies. In\nparticular we have found a lower bound for the cooperativity of the atom-cavity\nsystem which enables the implementation of phase shift on single photons. The\ninduced shift on the phase of a photonic qubit and the controlled phase gate\nbetween single photons, combined with optical devices, enable to perform\nuniversal quantum computation.\n", "  We use cosmological hydrodynamical simulations to study the effect of\nscreened modified gravity models on the mass estimates of galaxy clusters. In\nparticular, we focus on two novel aspects: (i) we study modified gravity models\nin which baryons and dark matter are coupled with different strengths to the\nscalar field, and, (ii) we put the simulation results into the greater context\nof a general screened-modified gravity parametrization. We have compared the\nmass of clusters inferred via lensing versus the mass inferred via kinematical\nmeasurements as a probe of violations of the equivalence principle at Mpc\nscales. We find that estimates of cluster masses via X-ray observations is\nmainly sensitive to the coupling between the scalar degree of freedom and\nbaryons - while the kinematical mass is mainly sensitive to the coupling to\ndark matter. Therefore, the relation between the two mass estimates is a probe\nof a possible non-universal coupling between the scalar field, the standard\nmodel fields, and dark matter. Finally, we used observational data of kinetic,\nthermal and lensing masses to place constraints on deviations from general\nrelativity on cluster scales for a general parametrization of screened modified\ngravity theories which contains $f(R)$ and Symmetron models. We find that while\nthe kinematic mass can be used to place competitive constraints, using thermal\nmeasurements is challenging as a potential non-thermal contribution is\ndegenerate with the imprint of modified gravity.\n", "  We present a multi-wavelength study of the unidentified Fermi object, 3FGL\nJ0212.1+5320. Within the 95% error ellipse, Chandra detects a bright X-ray\nsource (i.e., F(0.5-7keV) = 1.4e-12 erg/cm^2/s), which has a low-mass optical\ncounterpart (M < 0.4 Msun and T ~ 6000 K). A clear ellipsoidal modulation is\nshown in optical/infrared at 20.87 hours. The gamma-ray properties of 3FGL\nJ0212.1+5320 are all consistent with that of a millisecond pulsar, suggesting\nthat it is a gamma-ray redback millisecond pulsar binary with a low-mass\ncompanion filling > 64% of the Roche-lobe. If confirmed, it will be a redback\nbinary with one of the longest orbital periods known. Spectroscopic data taken\nin 2015 from the Lijiang observatory show no evidence of strong emission lines,\nrevealing that the accretion is currently inactive (the rotation-powered pulsar\nstate). This is consistent with the low X-ray luminosities (Lx ~ 10^32 erg/s)\nand the possible X-ray modulation seen by Chandra and Swift. Considering that\nthe X-ray luminosity and the high X-ray-to-gamma-ray flux ratio (8%) are both\ncomparable to that of the two known gamma-ray transitional millisecond pulsars,\nwe suspect that 3FGL J0212.1+5320 could be a potential target to search for\nfuture transition to the accretion active state.\n", "  The NA48/2 and NA62-$R_K$ experiments at the CERN SPS collected large samples\nof charged kaon decays in flight in 2003--07. The data analysis is still\non-going (with over 20 publications produced so far); the recent results from\nthese experiments are presented. A new upper limit on the rate of a lepton\nnumber violating decay $K^\\pm\\to\\pi^\\mp\\mu^\\pm\\mu^\\pm$ is reported:\n$\\mathcal{B} < 8.6\\times 10^{-11}$ at 90\\% CL. Searches for heavy sterile\nneutrino $N_4$ and neutral scalar resonances ($\\chi$) in $K^\\pm\\to\\pi\\mu\\mu$\ndecays are reported. Upper limits on the products $\\mathcal{B}(K^\\pm\\to\\mu^\\pm\nN_4)\\mathcal{B}(N_4\\to\\pi^\\mp\\mu^\\pm)$ and $\\mathcal{B}(K^\\pm\\to\\pi^\\pm\n\\chi)\\mathcal{B}(\\chi\\to\\mu^+\\mu^-)$ are set in the range $10^{-10}$ to\n$10^{-9}$ for resonance lifetimes up to 100~ps. A preliminary measurement of\nthe electromagnetic transition form factor slope of the $\\pi^0$ from\n$1.05\\times 10^6$ fully reconstructed $\\pi^0\\to\\gamma e^+e^-$ decays is\npresented: the obtained result $a = (3.70 \\pm 0.53_\\text{stat} \\pm\n0.36_\\text{syst})\\times 10^{-2}$ represents the first observation of a non-zero\nslope in the time-like region of momentum transfer.\n", "  I give an overview of the physics potential at possible future $e^+ e^-$\ncolliders, including the ILC, FCC-ee, and CEPC. The goal is to explain some of\nthe measurements that can be done in the context of electroweak precision tests\nand Higgs couplings, to compare some of the options under consideration, and to\nput the measurements in context by summarizing their implications for some new\nphysics scenarios. This is a writeup of a plenary talk at the Hong Kong\nUniversity of Science and Technology Jockey Club Institute for Advanced Study\nProgram on High Energy Physics Conference, January 18--21, 2016. Some\npreviously unpublished electroweak precision results for FCC-ee and CEPC are\nincluded.\n", "  We provide the basic integrated physical properties of all the galaxies\ncontained in the full CASSIS with available broad-band photometry from UV to 22\n$\\mu$m. We have collected photometric measurements in 14 wavelengths from\navailable public surveys in order to study the SED of each galaxy in CASSIS,\nthus constructing a final sample of 1,146 galaxies in the redshift range\n0<z<2.5. The SEDs are modelled with the CIGALE code which relies on the energy\nbalance between the absorbed stellar and the dust emission while taking into\naccount the possible contribution due to the presence of an AGN. We split the\ngalaxies in three groups, a low-redshift, a mid-redshift and a high-redshift\nand find that the vast majority of the Spitzer/IRS galaxies are star-forming\nand lie on or above the star-forming MS of the corresponding redshift.\nMoreover, the emission of Spitzer/IRS galaxies with z<0.1 is mostly dominated\nby star-formation, galaxies in the mid-redshift bin are a mixture of star\nforming and AGN galaxies, while half of the galaxies with z<0.5 show moderate\nor high AGN activity. Additionally, using rest-frame NUV-r colour, S\\'ersic\nindices, optical OIII and NII emission lines we explore the nature of these\ngalaxies by investigating their structure as well as their star-formation and\nAGN activity. Using a colour magnitude diagram we confirm that 97% of the\ngalaxies with redshift smaller than 0.5 have experienced a recent\nstar-formation episode. For a sub-sample of galaxies with available structural\ninformation and redshift smaller than 0.3 we find that early-type galaxies are\nplaced below the MS, while late-type galaxies are found on the MS as expected.\nFinally, for all the galaxies with z<0.5 and available optical spectral line\nmeasurements we find that galaxies with high AGN luminosity, as calculated by\nCIGALE, are most likely to be classified as composite or AGNs by optical\nspectral lines.\n", "  Lattice QCD approach to study the hadronic resonances and exotic hadrons is\ndescribed at an introductory level. The main challenge is that these states\ndecay strongly via one or more decay channels, and they often lie near\nthersholds. Specific results for conventional and exotic hadrons are shown to\nillustrate the current status.\n", "  Pickup ions are created when interstellar neutral atoms resonantly exchange\ncharge with the solar wind (SW) ions, especially in the supersonic part of the\nwind, where they carry most of the plasma pressure. Here we present numerical\nsimulation results of the 3D heliospheric interface treating pickup ions as a\nseparate proton fluid. To satisfy the fundamental conservation laws, we solve\nthe system of equations describing the flow of the mixture of electrons,\nthermal protons, and pickup ions. To find the density and pressure of pickup\nions behind the termination shock, we employ simple boundary conditions that\ntake into account the \\emph{Voyager} observations that showed that the decrease\nin the kinetic energy of the mixture at the termination shock predominantly\ncontributed to the increase in the pressure of pickup ions. We show that this\nmodel adequately describes the flow of the plasma mixture and results in a\nnoticeable decrease in the heliosheath width.\n", "  We propose the use of stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP) to offer a\nfast high fidelity method of performing SU(2) rotations on spinor Bose Einstein\ncondensates (BEC). Past demonstrations of BEC optical control suffer from\ndifficulties arising from collective enhancement of spontaneous emission and\ninefficient two-photon transitions originating from selection rules. We present\nhere a novel scheme which allows for arbitrary coherent rotations of\ntwo-component BECs while overcoming these issues. Numerical tests of the method\nshow that for BECs of \\ce{^{87}Rb} with up to $ 10^4 $ atoms and gate times of\n$ \\SI{1}{\\micro\\second} $, decoherence due to spontaneous emission can be\nsuppressed to negligible values.\n", "  We experimentally study a homodyne detection technique for the\ncharacterization of a quadrature squeezed field where the correlated bands,\nhere created by four-wave mixing in a hot atomic vapor, are separated by a\nlarge frequency gap of more than 6 GHz. The technique uses a two-frequency\nlocal oscillator to detect the fluctuations of the correlated bands at a\nfrequency accessible to the detection electronics. Working at low detection\nfrequency, the method allows for the determination of both the amplitude and\nthe phase of the squeezing spectrum. In particular, we show that the quadrature\nsqueezing created by our four-wave mixing process displays a noise ellipse\nrotation of $\\pi/2$ across the squeezing spectrum\n", "  We perform Glauber model calculations of the antiproton-nucleus elastic and\nquasielastic scattering and absorption in the beam momentum range $\\sim\n0.5\\div10$ GeV/c. A good agreement of our calculations with available LEAR data\nand with earlier Glauber model studies of the $\\bar p A$ elastic scattering\nallows us to make predictions at the beam momenta of $\\sim 10$ GeV/c, i.e. at\nthe regime of the PANDA experiment at FAIR. The comparison with the\nproton-nucleus elastic scattering cross sections shows that the diffractive\nminima are much deeper in the $\\bar p A$ case due to smaller absolute value of\nthe ratio of the real-to-imaginary part of the elementary elastic amplitude.\nSignificant polarization signal for $\\bar p A$ elastic scattering at 10 GeV/c\nis expected. We have also revealed a strong dependence of the $\\bar p A$\nabsorption cross section on the slope parameter of the transverse momentum\ndependence of the elementary $\\bar pN$ amplitude. The $\\bar p A$ optical\npotential is discussed.\n", "  We analyze Chandra X-ray images of a sample of 11 quasars that are known to\ncontain kiloparsec scale radio jets. The sample consists of five high-redshift\n(z >= 3.6) flat-spectrum radio quasars, and six intermediate redshift (2.1 < z\n< 2.9) quasars. The dataset includes four sources with integrated steep radio\nspectra and seven with flat radio spectra. A total of 25 radio jet features are\npresent in this sample. We apply a Bayesian multi-scale image reconstruction\nmethod to detect and measure the X-ray emission from the jets. We compute\ndeviations from a baseline model that does not include the jet, and compare\nobserved X-ray images with those computed with simulated images where no jet\nfeatures exist. This allows us to compute p-value upper bounds on the\nsignificance that an X- ray jet is detected in a pre-determined region of\ninterest. We detected 12 of the features unambiguously, and an additional 6\nmarginally. We also find residual emission in the cores of 3 quasars and in the\nbackground of 1 quasar that suggest the existence of unresolved X-ray jets. The\ndependence of the X-ray to radio luminosity ratio on redshift is a potential\ndiagnostic of the emission mechanism, since the inverse Compton scattering of\ncosmic microwave background photons (IC/CMB) is thought to be redshift\ndependent, whereas in synchrotron models no clear redshift dependence is\nexpected. We find that the high-redshift jets have X-ray to radio flux ratios\nthat are marginally inconsistent with those from lower redshifts, suggesting\nthat either the X-ray emissions is due to the IC/CMB rather than the\nsynchrotron process, or that high redshift jets are qualitatively different.\n", "  We study the origin of broadening of superconducting transition in sputtered\nNb films. From simultaneous tunneling and transport measurements we conclude\nthat the upper critical field Hc2 always corresponds to the bottom of\ntransition R~0, while the top R~Rn occurs close to the critical field for\ndestruction of surface superconductivity Hc3 ~ 1.7 Hc2. The two-dimensional\nnature of superconductivity at H>Hc2 is confirmed by cusp-like angular\ndependence of magnetoresistance. Our data indicates that surface\nsuperconductivity is remarkably robust even in disordered polycrystalline films\nand, surprisingly, even in perpendicular magnetic fields.\n", "  We have recently reported the discovery of five low redshift Lyman continuum\n(LyC) emitters (LCEs, hereafter) with absolute escape fractions fesc(LyC)\nranging from 6 to 13%, higher than previously found, and which more than\ndoubles the number of low redshift LCEs.We use these observations to test\ntheoretical predictions about a link between the characteristics of the\nLyman-alpha (Lya) line from galaxies and the escape of ionising photons. We\nanalyse the Lya spectra of eight LCEs of the local Universe observed with the\nCosmic Origins Spectrograph onboard the Hubble Space Telescope (our five\nleakers and three galaxies from the litterature), and compare their strengths\nand shapes to the theoretical criteria and comparison samples of local\ngalaxies: the Lyman Alpha Reference Survey, Lyman Break Analogs, Green Peas,\nand the high-redshift strong LyC leaker Ion2. Our LCEs are found to be strong\nLya emitters, with high equivalent widths, EW(Lya)> 70 {\\AA}, and large Lya\nescape fractions, fesc(Lya) > 20%. The Lya profiles are all double-peaked with\na small peak separation, in agreement with our theoretical expectations. They\nalso have no underlying absorption at the Lya position. All these\ncharacteristics are very different from the Lya properties of typical\nstar-forming galaxies of the local Universe. A subset of the comparison samples\n(2-3 Green Pea galaxies) share these extreme values, indicating that they could\nalso be leaking. We also find a strong correlation between the star formation\nrate surface density and the escape fraction of ionising photons, indicating\nthat the compactness of star-forming regions plays a role in shaping low column\ndensity paths in the interstellar medium of LCEs. The Lya properties of LCEs\nare peculiar: Lya can be used as a reliable tracer of LyC escape from galaxies,\nin complement to other indirect diagnostics proposed in the literature.\n", "  With the steadily improving sensitivity afforded by current and future galaxy\nsurveys, a robust extraction of two-point correlation function measurements may\nbecome increasingly hampered by the presence of astrophysical foregrounds or\nobservational systematics. The concept of mode projection has been introduced\nas a means to remove contaminants for which it is possible to construct a\nspatial map reflecting the expected signal contribution. Owing to its\ncomputational efficiency compared to minimum-variance methods, the sub-optimal\npseudo-Cl (PCL) power spectrum estimator is a popular tool for the analysis of\nhigh-resolution data sets. Here, we integrate mode projection into the\nframework of PCL power spectrum estimation. In contrast to results obtained\nwith optimal estimators, we show that the uncorrected projection of template\nmaps leads to biased power spectra. Based on analytical calculations, we find\nexact closed-form expressions for the expectation value of the bias and\ndemonstrate that they can be recast in a form that allows a numerically\nefficient evaluation, preserving the favorable O(l_max^3) time complexity of\nPCL estimator algorithms. Using simulated data sets, we assess the scaling of\nthe bias with various analysis parameters and demonstrate that it can be\nreliably removed. We conclude that in combination with mode projection, PCL\nestimators allow for a fast and robust computation of power spectra in the\npresence of systematic effects -- properties in high demand for the analysis of\nongoing and future large scale structure surveys.\n", "  We report on an environmentally stable, Yb-doped, all-normal dispersion,\nmode-locked fibre laser that is capable of creating broadband pulses with\nultra-low repetition rates. Specifically, through careful positioning of fibre\nsections in an all-PM-fibre cavity mode-locked with a nonlinear amplifying loop\nmirror, we achieve stable pulse trains with repetition rates as low as 506 kHz.\nThe pulses have several nanojules of energy and are compressible down to\nultrashort (< 500 fs) durations.\n", "  In this work, we study the effects of non-Condon vibronic coupling on the\nquantum coherence of excitation energy transfer, via the exact\ndissipaton-equation-of-motion (DEOM) evaluations on excitonic model systems.\nField-triggered excitation energy transfer dynamics and two dimensional\ncoherent spectroscopy are simulated for both Condon and non-Condon vibronic\ncouplings. Our results clearly demonstrate that the non-Condon vibronic\ncoupling intensifies the dynamical electronic-vibrational energy transfer and\nenhances the total system-and-bath quantum coherence. Moreover, the hybrid bath\ndynamics for non-Condon effects enriches the theoretical calculation, and\nfurther sheds light on the interpretation of the experimental nonlinear\nspectroscopy.\n", "  We report the transport properties of mechanically exfoliated few-layer\nSnSe$_{2}$ flakes, whose mobility is found with four probe measurements to be ~\n85 cm$^{2}$V$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$ at 300 K, higher than those of the majority of\nfew-layer transitional metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). The mobility increases\nstrongly with decreased temperature, indicating a phonon limited transport. The\nconductivity of the semiconducting SnSe$_{2}$ shows a metallic behavior, which\nis explained by two competing factors involving the different temperature\ndependence of mobility and carrier density. The Fermi level is found to be 87\nmeV below the conduction band minima (CBM) at 300 K and 12 meV below the CBM at\n78 K, resulting from a heavy n-type doping. Previous studies have found\nSnSe$_{2}$ field-effect transistors (FETs) to be very difficult to turn off. We\nfind the limiting factor to be the flake thickness compared with the maximum\ndepletion width. With fully depleted devices, we are able to achieve a current\non-off ratio of ~10$^{5}$. These results demonstrate the great potential of\nSnSe2 as a two dimensional (2D) semiconducting material and are helpful for our\nunderstanding of other heavily doped 2D materials.\n", "  Using relativistic first-principles calculations, we show that the chemical\ntrend of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) in 3d-5d ultrathin films\nfollows Hund's first rule with a tendency similar to their magnetic moments in\neither the unsupported 3d monolayers or 3d-5d interfaces. We demonstrate that,\nbesides the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) effect in inversion asymmetric\nnoncollinear magnetic systems, the driving force is the 3d orbital occupation\nand their spin flip/mixing processes with the spin-orbit active 5d states\ncontrol directly the sign and magnitude of the DMI. The magnetic chirality\nchanges are discussed in the light of the interplay between SOC, Hund's first\nrule, and the crystal field splitting of d orbitals.\n", "  Non-global logarithms (NGLs) are the leading manifestation of correlations\nbetween distinct phase space regions in QCD and gauge theories and have proven\na challenge to understand using traditional resummation techniques. Recently,\nthe dressed gluon expansion was introduced that enables an expansion of the NGL\nseries in terms of a \"dressed gluon\" building block, defined by an all-orders\nfactorization theorem. Here, we clarify the nature of the dressed gluon\nexpansion, and prove that it has an infinite radius of convergence as a\nsolution to the leading logarithmic and large-$N_c$ master equation for NGLs,\nthe Banfi-Marchesini-Smye (BMS) equation. The dressed gluon expansion therefore\nprovides an expansion of the NGL series that can be truncated at any order,\nwith reliable uncertainty estimates. In contrast, manifest in the results of\nthe fixed-order expansion of the BMS equation up to 12-loops is a breakdown of\nconvergence at a finite value of $\\alpha_s$log. We explain this finite radius\nof convergence using the dressed gluon expansion, showing how the dynamics of\nthe buffer region, a region of phase space near the boundary of the jet that\nwas identified in early studies of NGLs, leads to large contributions to the\nfixed order expansion. We also use the dressed gluon expansion to discuss the\nconvergence of the next-to-leading NGL series, and the role of collinear\nlogarithms that appear at this order. Finally, we show how an understanding of\nthe analytic behavior obtained from the dressed gluon expansion allows us to\nimprove the fixed order NGL series using conformal transformations to extend\nthe domain of analyticity. This allows us to calculate the NGL distribution for\nall values of $\\alpha_s$log from the coefficients of the fixed order expansion.\n", "  The black hole information problem has been a challenge since Hawking's\noriginal 1975 paper. It led to the discovery of AdS/CFT, which gave a partial\nresolution of the paradox. However, recent developments, in particular the\nfirewall puzzle, show that there is much that we do not understand. I review\nthe black hole, Hawking radiation, and the Page curve, and the classic form of\nthe paradox. I discuss AdS/CFT as a partial resolution. I then discuss black\nhole complementarity and its limitations, leading to many proposals for\ndifferent kinds of `drama.' I conclude with some recent ideas.\n", "  Outflows have been shown to be prevalent in galaxies hosting luminous active\ngalactic nuclei (AGNs) and present a physically plausible way to couple the AGN\nenergy output with the interstellar medium of their hosts. Despite their\nprevalence, accurate characterization of these outflows has been challenging.\nIn the second of a series of papers, we use Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph\nIFU data of 6 local (z<0.1) and moderate-luminosity Type 2 AGNs to study the\nionization properties and energetics of AGN-driven outflows. We find strong\nevidence that connect the extreme kinematics of the ionized gas with the AGN\nphotoionization. The kinematic component related to the AGN-driven outflow is\nclearly separated from other kinematic components, such as virial motions or\nrotation, on the velocity and velocity dispersion diagram. Our spatially\nresolved kinematic analysis reveals that from 30% up to 90% of the total mass\nand kinetic energy of the outflow is contained within the central kpc of the\ngalaxy. The spatially integrated mass and kinetic energy of the gas entrained\nin the outflow correlates well with the AGN bolometric luminosity and results\nin energy conversion efficiencies between 0.01% and 1%. Intriguingly, we detect\nubiquitous signs of ongoing circumnuclear star formation. Their small size, the\ncentrally contained mass and energy, and the universally detected circumnuclear\nstar formation cast doubts on the potency of these AGN-driven outflows as\nagents of galaxy-scale negative feedback.\n", "  We consider quark-photon correlations that have been proposed as a source for\nsingle-spin asymmetries in inclusive deep-inelastic scattering. A new sum rule\nfor these correlators is derived and its phenomenological consequences are\ndiscussed. The results are interpreted within the context of an intuitive\n'electrodynamic lensing' picture.\n", "  We present our analysis on the photon structure functions at small Bjorken\nvariable x in the framework of the holographic QCD. In the kinematic region, a\nphoton can fluctuate into vector mesons and behaves like a hadron rather than a\npointlike particle. Assuming the Pomeron exchange dominance, the dominant\nhadronic contribution to the structure functions is computed by convoluting the\nprobe and target photon density distributions obtained from the wave functions\nof the U(1) vector field in the five-dimensional AdS space and the\nBrower-Polchinski-Strassler-Tan Pomeron exchange kernel. Our calculations are\nin agreement with both the experimental data from OPAL collaboration at LEP and\nthose calculated from the parton distribution functions of the photon proposed\nby Gl\\\"uck, Reya, and Schienbein. The predictions presented here will be tested\nat future linear colliders, such as the planned International Linear Collider.\n", "  We discuss nuclear cross sections for $AA \\to AAV$ and $AA \\to AAVV$\nreactions with one or two vector mesons in the final state. Our analysis is\ndone in the impact parameter space equivalent photon approximation. This\napproach allows to consider the above processes taking into account distance\nbetween colliding nuclei. We consider both ultraperipheral and semi-central\ncollisions. We are a first group which undertook a study of single $J/\\psi$\nphotoproduction for different centrality bins. We show that one can describe\nnew ALICE experimental data by including geometrical effects of collisions in\nthe flux factor.\n  Next, total and differential cross section for double-scattering mechanism in\nthe exclusive $AA \\to AAVV$ reaction in ultrarelativistic ultraperipheral heavy\nion collisions is presented. In this context we consider double photoproduction\nand photon-photon processes. Simultaneously, we get very good agreement of our\nresults with STAR (RHIC), CMS and ALICE (LHC) experimental data for single\n$\\rho^0$ and $J/\\psi$ vector meson production. A comparison of our predictions\nfor exclusive four charged pions production is also presented.\n", "  The nematic twist-bend (TB) phase, exhibited by certain achiral thermotropic\nliquid crystalline (LC) dimers, features a nanometer-scale, heliconical\nrotation of the average molecular long axis (director) with equally probable\nleft- and right-handed domains. On meso to macroscopic scales, the TB phase may\nbe considered as a stack of equivalent slabs or \"pseudo-layers\", each one\nhelical pitch in thickness. The long wavelength fluctuation modes should then\nbe analogous to those of a smectic-A phase, and in particular the hydrodynamic\nmode combining \"layer\" compression and bending ought to be characterized by an\neffective layer compression elastic constant $B_{eff}$ and average director\nsplay constant $K_1^{eff}$. The magnitude of $K_1^{eff}$ is expected to be\nsimilar to the splay constant of an ordinary nematic LC, but due to the absence\nof a true mass density wave, $B_{eff}$ could differ substantially from the\ntypical value of $\\sim 10^6$ Pa in a conventional smectic-A. Here we report the\nresults of a dynamic light scattering study, which confirms the \"pseudo-layer\"\nstructure of the TB phase with $B_{eff}$ in the range $\\sim 10^3-10^4$ Pa. We\nshow additionally that the temperature dependence of $B_{eff}$ at the TB to\nnematic transition is accurately described by a coarse-grained free energy\ndensity, which is based on a Landau-deGennes expansion in terms of a heli-polar\norder parameter that characterizes the TB state and is linearly coupled to bend\ndistortion of the director.\n", "  Intensity mapping is a promising technique for surveying the large scale\nstructure of our Universe from $z=0$ to $z \\sim 150$, using the brightness\ntemperature field of spectral lines to directly observe previously unexplored\nportions of out cosmic timeline. Examples of targeted lines include the\n$21\\,\\textrm{cm}$ hyperfine transition of neutral hydrogen, rotational lines of\ncarbon monoxide, and fine structure lines of singly ionized carbon. Recent\nefforts have focused on detections of the power spectrum of spatial\nfluctuations, but have been hindered by systematics such as foreground\ncontamination. This has motivated the decomposition of data into Fourier modes\nperpendicular and parallel to the line-of-sight, which has been shown to be a\nparticularly powerful way to diagnose systematics. However, such a method is\nwell-defined only in the limit of a narrow-field, flat-sky approximation. This\nlimits the sensitivity of intensity mapping experiments, as it means that wide\nsurveys must be separately analyzed as a patchwork of smaller fields. In this\npaper, we develop a framework for analyzing intensity mapping data in a\nspherical Fourier-Bessel basis, which incorporates curved sky effects without\ndifficulty. We use our framework to generalize a number of techniques in\nintensity mapping data analysis from the flat sky to the curved sky. These\ninclude visibility-based estimators for the power spectrum, treatments of\ninterloper lines, and the \"foreground wedge\" signature of spectrally smooth\nforegrounds.\n", "  Due to its proximity, SN 1987A offers a unique opportunity to directly\nobserve the geometry of a stellar explosion as it unfolds. Here we present\nspectral and imaging observations of SN 1987A obtained ~10,000 days after the\nexplosion with HST/STIS and VLT/SINFONI at optical and near-infrared\nwavelengths. These observations allow us to produce the most detailed 3D map of\nH-alpha to date, the first 3D maps for [Ca II] \\lambda \\lambda 7292, 7324, [O\nI] \\lambda \\lambda 6300, 6364 and Mg II \\lambda \\lambda 9218, 9244, as well as\nnew maps for [Si I]+[Fe II] 1.644 \\mu m and He I 2.058 \\mu m. A comparison with\nprevious observations shows that the [Si I]+[Fe II] flux and morphology have\nnot changed significantly during the past ten years, providing evidence that it\nis powered by 44Ti. The time-evolution of H-alpha shows that it is\npredominantly powered by X-rays from the ring, in agreement with previous\nfindings. All lines that have sufficient signal show a similar large-scale 3D\nstructure, with a north-south asymmetry that resembles a broken dipole. This\nstructure correlates with early observations of asymmetries, showing that there\nis a global asymmetry that extends from the inner core to the outer envelope.\nOn smaller scales, the two brightest lines, H-alpha and [Si I]+[Fe II] 1.644\n\\mu m, show substructures at the level of ~ 200 - 1000 km/s and clear\ndifferences in their 3D geometries. We discuss these results in the context of\nexplosion models and the properties of dust in the ejecta.\n", "  The exoplanet HD97658b provides a rare opportunity to probe the atmospheric\ncomposition and evolution of moderately irradiated super-Earths. It transits a\nbright K star at a moderate orbital distance of 0.08 au. Its low density is\ncompatible with a massive steam envelope that could photodissociate at high\naltitudes and become observable as escaping hydrogen. Our analysis of 3\ntransits with HST/STIS at Ly-alpha reveals no such signature, suggesting that\nthe thermosphere is not hydrodynamically expanding and is subjected to a low\nescape of neutral hydrogen (<10^8 g/s at 3 sigma). Using HST Ly-alpha and\nChandra & XMM-Newton observations at different epochs, we find that HD97658 is\na weak and soft X-ray source with signs of chromospheric variability in the\nLy-alpha line core. We determine an average reference for the intrinsic\nLy-alpha line and XUV spectrum of the star, and show that HD97658 b is in mild\nconditions of irradiation compared to other known evaporating exoplanets with\nan XUV irradiation about 3 times lower than the evaporating warm Neptune GJ436\nb. This could be why the thermosphere of HD97658b is not expanding: the low XUV\nirradiation prevents an efficient photodissociation of any putative steam\nenvelope. Alternatively, it could be linked to a low hydrogen content or\ninefficient conversion of the stellar energy input. The HD97658 system provides\nclues for understanding the stability of low-mass planet atmospheres. Our study\nof HD97658 b can be seen as a control experiment of our methodology, confirming\nthat it does not bias detections of atmospheric escape and underlining its\nstrength and reliability. Our results show that stellar activity can be\nefficiently discriminated from absorption signatures by a transiting exospheric\ncloud. They also highlight the potential of observing the upper atmosphere of\nsmall transiting planets to probe their physical and chemical properties\n", "  The use of femtosecond lasers to introduce controlled stress states has\nrecently been demonstrated in silica glass. We use this technique, in\ncombination with chemical etching, to generate and control stress-induced\nbirefringence over a well-defined region of interest, demonstrating\ndirect-write wave plates with precisely tailored retardance levels. This\ntailoring enables the fabrication of laser-written polarization optics that can\nbe tuned to any wavelength for which silica is transparent and with a clear\naperture free of any laser modifications. Using this approach, we achieve\nsufficient retardance to act as a quarter-wave plate. The stress distribution\nwithin the clear aperture is analyzed and modeled, providing a generic template\nthat can be used as a set of design rules for laser-machined polarization\ndevices.\n", "  We compute (pseudo)critical temperature, $T_c$, of chiral symmetry\nrestoration for quark matter in the background of parallel electric and\nmagnetic fields. This field configuration leads to the production of a chiral\nmedium on a time scale $\\tau$, characterized by a nonvanishing value of the\nchiral density that equilibrates due to microscopic processes in the thermal\nbath. We estimate the relaxation time $\\tau$ to be about $\\approx 0.1-1$ fm/c\naround the chiral crossover; then we compute the effect of the fields and of\nthe chiral medium on~$T_c$. We find $T_c$ to be lowered by the external fields\nin the chiral medium.\n", "  The goal of the COMPASS experiment at CERN is to study the structure and\ndynamics of hadrons. The two-stage spectrometer used by the experiment has\nlarge acceptance and covers a wide kinematic range for charged as well as\nneutral particles and can therefore measure a wide range of reactions. The\nspectroscopy of light mesons is performed with negative (mostly $\\pi^-$) and\npositive ($p$, $\\pi^+$) hadron beams with a momentum of 190 GeV/$c$. The\nlight-meson spectrum is measured in different final states produced in\ndiffractive dissociation reactions with squared four-momentum transfer $t$ to\nthe target between 0.1 and 1.0 $(\\text{GeV}/c)^2$. The flagship channel is the\n$\\pi^-\\pi^-\\pi^+$ final state, for which COMPASS has recorded the currently\nworld's largest data sample. These data not only allow to measure the\nproperties of known resonances with high precision, but also to observe new\nstates. Among these is a new axial-vector signal, the $a_1(1420)$, with unusual\nproperties. Novel analysis techniques have been developed to extract also the\namplitude of the $\\pi^-\\pi^+$ subsystem as a function of $3\\pi$ mass from the\ndata. The findings are confirmed by the analysis of the $\\pi^-\\pi^0\\pi^0$ final\nstate.\n", "  We perform real-space imaging of propagating magnetic domains in the\nfractional quantum Hall system using spin-sensitive photoluminescence\nmicroscopy. The propagation is continuous and proceeds in the direction of the\nconventional current, i.e. opposite to the electron flow direction. The\nmechanism of motion is shown to be connected to polarized nuclear spins around\nthe domain walls. The propagation velocity increases when nuclei are\ndepolarized, and decreases when the source-drain current generating this\nnuclear polarization is increased. We discuss how these phenomena may arise\nfrom spin interactions along the domain walls.\n", "  We have calculated one-loop amplitudes for the production of Higgs boson in\nassociation with two electroweak bosons ($H,\\gamma,Z$) via gluon-gluon fusion.\nWe present preliminary results for the total cross section at 8, 13 and 100 TeV\ncenter-of-mass energies at $pp$ colliders. We study the interference effect\nand, also comment on the effect of new physics in terms of anomalous couplings\nof the Higgs boson in these processes.\n", "  The core region of a neutron star may feature quark matter in the\ncolor-flavor- locked (CFL) phase. The CFL condensate breaks the baryon number\nsymmetry, such that the phenomenon of superfluidity arises. If the core of the\nstar is rotating, vortices will form in the superfluid, carrying the quanta of\nangular momentum. In a previous study we have solved the question of stability\nof these vortices, where we found numerical proof of a conjectured instability,\naccording to which superfluid vortices will decay into an arrangement of\nso-called semi-superfluid fluxtubes. Here we report first results of an\nextension of our framework that allows us to study multi-vortex dynamics. This\nwill in turn enable us to investigate the structure of semi-superfluid string\nlattices, which could be relevant to study pinning phenomena at the boundary of\nthe core.\n", "  Most of the quantitative information about the magnetic field vector in solar\nprominences comes from the analysis of the Hanle effect acting on lines formed\nby scattering. As these lines can be of non-negligible optical thickness, it is\nof interest to study the line formation process further. We investigate the\nmultidimensional effects on the interpretation of spectropolarimetric\nobservations, particularly on the inference of the magnetic field vector. We do\nthis by analyzing the differences between multidimensional models, which\ninvolve fully self-consistent radiative transfer computations in the presence\nof spatial inhomogeneities and velocity fields, and those which rely on simple\none-dimensional geometry. We study the formation of a prototype line in ad hoc\ninhomogeneous, isothermal 2D prominence models. We solve the NLTE polarized\nline formation problem in the presence of a large-scale oriented magnetic\nfield. The resulting polarized line profiles are then interpreted (i.e.\ninverted) assuming a simple 1D slab model. We find that differences between\ninput and the inferred magnetic field vector are non-negligible. Namely, we\nalmost universally find that the inferred field is weaker and more horizontal\nthan the input field. Spatial inhomogeneities and radiative transfer have a\nstrong effect on scattering line polarization in the optically thick lines. In\nreal-life situations, ignoring these effects could lead to a serious\nmisinterpretation of spectropolarimetric observations of chromospheric objects\nsuch as prominences.\n", "  We construct the on-shell double copy for linearised four-dimensional ${\\cal\nN}=2$ supergravity coupled to one vector multiplet with a quadratic\nprepotential. We apply this dictionary to the weak-field approximation of\ndyonic BPS black holes in this theory.\n", "  We consider a class of minimal abelian extensions of the Standard Model with\nan extra neutral gauge boson $Z'$ at the TeV scale. In these scenarios an\nextended scalar sector and heavy right-handed neutrinos are naturally\nenvisaged. We present some of their striking signatures at the Large Hadron\nCollider, the most interesting arising from a $Z'$ decaying to heavy neutrino\npairs as well as a heavy scalar decaying to two Standard Model Higgses. Using\nrenormalisation group methods, we characterise the high energy behaviours of\nthese extensions and exploit the constraints imposed by the embedding into a\nwider GUT scenario.\n", "  Electron cyclotron resonant scattering features (CRSFs) are observed as\nabsorption-like lines in the spectra of X-ray pulsars. A significant fraction\nof the computing time for Monte Carlo simulations of these quantum mechanical\nfeatures is spent on the calculation of the mean free path for each individual\nphoton before scattering, since it involves a complex numerical integration\nover the scattering cross section and the (thermal) velocity distribution of\nthe scattering electrons.\n  We aim to numerically calculate interpolation tables which can be used in\nCRSF simulations to sample the mean free path of the scattering photon and the\nmomentum of the scattering electron. The tables also contain all the\ninformation required for sampling the scattering electron's final spin.\n  The tables were calculated using an adaptive Simpson integration scheme. The\nenergy and angle grids were refined until a prescribed accuracy is reached. The\ntables are used by our simulation code to produce artificial CRSF spectra. The\nelectron momenta sampled during these simulations were analyzed and justified\nusing theoretically determined boundaries.\n  We present a complete set of tables suited for mean free path calculations of\nMonte Carlo simulations of the cyclotron scattering process for conditions\nexpected in typical X-ray pulsar accretion columns (0.01<B/B_{crit}<=0.12,\nwhere B_{crit}=4.413x10^{13} G and 3keV<=kT<15keV). The sampling of the tables\nis chosen such that the results have an estimated relative error of at most\n1/15 for all points in the grid. The tables are available online at\nhttp://www.sternwarte.uni-erlangen.de/research/cyclo.\n", "  Planet formation theories predict a large but still undetected population of\nshort-period terrestrial planets orbiting brown dwarfs. Should specimens of\nthis population be discovered transiting relatively bright and nearby brown\ndwarfs, the Jupiter-size and the low luminosity of their hosts would make them\nexquisite targets for detailed atmospheric characterisation with JWST and\nfuture ground-based facilities. The eventual discovery and detailed study of a\nsignificant sample of transiting terrestrial planets orbiting nearby brown\ndwarfs could prove to be useful not only for comparative exoplanetology but\nalso for astrobiology, by bringing us key information on the physical\nrequirements and timescale for the emergence of life.\n  In this context, we present a search for transit-signals in archival\ntime-series photometry acquired by the Spitzer Space Telescope for a sample of\n44 nearby brown dwarfs. While these 44 targets were not particularly selected\nfor their brightness, the high precision of their Spitzer light curves allows\nus to reach sensitivities below Earth-sized planets for 75% of the sample and\ndown to Europa-sized planets on the brighter targets. We could not identify any\nunambiguous planetary signal. Instead, we could compute the first limits on the\npresence of planets on close-in orbits. We find that within a 1.28 day orbit,\nthe occurrence rate of planets with a radius between 0.75 and 3.25 R$_\\oplus$\nis {\\eta} < 67 $\\pm$ 1%. For planets with radii between 0.75 and 1.25\nR$_\\oplus$, we place a 95% confident upper limit of {\\eta} < 87 $\\pm$ 3%. If we\nassume an occurrence rate of {\\eta} = 27% for these planets with radii between\n0.75 and 1.25 R$_\\oplus$, as the discoveries of the Kepler-42b and TRAPPIST-1b\nsystems would suggest, we estimate that 175 brown dwarfs need to be monitored\nin order to guarantee (95%) at least one detection.\n", "  We construct Nernst brane solutions, that is black branes with zero entropy\ndensity in the extremal limit, of FI-gauged minimal five-dimensional\nsupergravity coupled to an arbitrary number of vector multiplets. While the\nscalars take specific constant values and dynamically determine the value of\nthe cosmological constant in terms of the FI-parameters, the metric takes the\nform of a boosted AdS Schwarzschild black brane. This metric can be brought to\nthe Carter-Novotny-Horsky form that has previously been observed to occur in\ncertain limits of boosted D3-branes. By dimensional reduction to four\ndimensions we recover the four-dimensional Nernst branes of arXiv:1501.07863\nand show how the five-dimensional lift resolves all their UV singularities. The\ndynamics of the compactification circle, which expands both in the UV and in\nthe IR, plays a crucial role. At asymptotic infinity, the curvature singularity\nof the four-dimensional metric and the run-away behaviour of the\nfour-dimensional scalar combine in such a way that the lifted solution becomes\nasymptotic to AdS5. Moreover, the existence of a finite chemical potential in\nfour dimensions is related to fact that the compactification circle has a\nfinite minimal value. While it is not clear immediately how to embed our\nsolutions into string theory, we argue that the same type of dictionary as\nproposed for boosted D3-branes should apply, although with a lower amount of\nsupersymmetry.\n", "  We construct domain wall fermions with a staggered kernel and investigate\ntheir spectral and chiral properties numerically in the Schwinger model. In\nsome relevant cases we see an improvement of chirality by more than an order of\nmagnitude as compared to usual domain wall fermions. Moreover, we present first\nresults for four-dimensional quantum chromodynamics, where we also observe\nsignificant reductions of chiral symmetry violations for staggered domain wall\nfermions.\n", "  We examine the spatial distribution of the oldest and most metal poor stellar\npopulations of Milky Way-sized galaxies using the APOSTLE cosmological\nhydrodynamical simulations of the Local Group. In agreement with earlier work,\nwe find strong radial gradients in the fraction of the oldest (tform < 0.8 Gyr)\nand most metal poor ([Fe/H]< -2.5) stars, both of which increase outwards. The\nmost metal poor stars form over an extended period of time; half of them form\nafter z = 5.3, and the last 10% after z = 2.8. The age of the metal poor\nstellar population also shows significant variation with environment; a high\nfraction of them are old in the galaxy's central regions and an even higher\nfraction in some individual dwarf galaxies, with substantial scatter from dwarf\nto dwarf. Overall, over half of the stars that belong to both the oldest and\nmost metal-poor population are found outside the solar circle. Somewhat\ncounter-intuitively, we find that dwarf galaxies with a large fraction of metal\npoor stars that are very old are systems where metal poor stars are relatively\nrare, but where a substantial old population is present. Our results provide\nguidance for interpreting the results of surveys designed to hunt for the\nearliest and most pristine stellar component of our Milky Way.\n", "  In view of the High Luminosity upgrade of the Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC),\nplanned to start around 2023-2025, the ATLAS experiment will undergo a\nreplacement of the Inner Detector. A higher luminosity will imply higher\nirradiation levels and hence will demand more ra- diation hardness especially\nin the inner layers of the pixel system. The n-in-p silicon technology is a\npromising candidate to instrument this region, also thanks to its\ncost-effectiveness because it only requires a single sided processing in\ncontrast to the n-in-n pixel technology presently employed in the LHC\nexperiments. In addition, thin sensors were found to ensure radiation hardness\nat high fluences. An overview is given of recent results obtained with not\nirradiated and irradiated n-in-p planar pixel modules. The focus will be on\nn-in-p planar pixel sensors with an active thickness of 100 and 150 um recently\nproduced at ADVACAM. To maximize the active area of the sensors, slim and\nactive edges are implemented. The performance of these modules is investigated\nat beam tests and the results on edge efficiency will be shown.\n", "  Intrinsic colors of normal stars are derived in the popularly used infrared\nbands involving the 2MASS/JHKs, WISE, Spitzer/IRAC and AKARI/S9W filters. Based\non three spectroscopic surveys -- LAMOST, RAVE and APOGEE, stars are classified\ninto groups of giants and dwarfs, as well as metal-normal and metal-poor stars.\nAn empirical analytical relation of the intrinsic color is obtained with\nstellar effective temperature (Teff) for each group of stars after the\nzero-reddening stars are selected from the blue edge in the $J-\\lambda$ versus\n(Teff) diagram. It is found that metallicity has little effect on the infrared\ncolors. In the near-infrared bands, our results agree with previous work. In\naddition, the color indexes H-W2 and Ks-W1 that are taken as constant to\ncalculate interstellar extinction are discussed. The intrinsic color of M-type\nstars are derived separately due to lack of accurate measurement of their\neffective temperature.\n", "  We study parametric interactions in a new type of nonlinear photonic\nstructures, which is realized in the vicinity of a pair of nonlinear crystals.\nIn this kind of structure, which we call binary, multiple nonlinear optical\nprocesses can be implemented simultaneously, owing to multiple phase-matching\nconditions, fulfilled separately in the constituent crystals. The coupling\nbetween the nonlinear processes by means of modes sharing similar frequency is\nattained by the spatially-broadband nature of the parametric fields. We\ninvestigate the spatial properties of the fields generated in the binary\nstructure constructed from periodically poled crystals for the two examples: 1)\nsingle parametric down-conversion, and 2) coupled parametric down-conversion\nand up-conversion processes. The efficacy of the fields' generation in these\nexamples is analyzed through comparison with the cases of traditional single\nperiodically poled crystal and aperiodic photonic structure, respectively. It\nhas been shown that the relative shift between the periodic crystal lattices\nhas a crucial effect on the generated spatial field spectrum and the overall\nefficiency. In addition, the influence of the inter-crystal distance on these\ncharacteristics has been studied. Therefore, our study suggests that one can\nconstruct optical elements with sophisticated nonlinear properties from simpler\nelements without significant sacrifice of the efficacy.\n", "  Ultra-compact high velocity clouds (UCHVCs) were identified in the ALFALFA HI\nsurvey as potential gas-bearing dark matter halos. Here we present higher\nresolution neutral hydrogen (HI) observations of twelve UCHVCS with the\nWesterbork Synthesis Radio Telescope (WSRT). The UCHVCs were selected based on\na combination of size, isolation, large recessional velocity and high column\ndensity as the best candidate dark matter halos. The WSRT data were tapered to\nimage the UCHVCs at 210\" (comparable to Arecibo) and 105\" angular resolution.\nIn a comparison of the single-dish to interferometer data, we find that the\nline flux recovered in the WSRT observations is comparable to that from the\nsingle-dish ALFALFA data. In addition, any structure seen in the ALFALFA data\nis reproduced in the WSRT maps at the same angular resolution. At 210'\"\nresolution all the sources are generally compact with a smooth HI morphology,\nas expected from their identification as UCHVCs. At the higher angular\nresolution, a majority of the sources break into small clumps contained in a\ndiffuse envelope. These UCHVCs also have no ordered velocity motion and are\nmost likely Galactic halo clouds. We identify two UCHVCs, AGC 198606 and AGC\n249525, as excellent galaxy candidates based on maintaining a smooth HI\nmorphology at higher angular resolution and showing ordered velocity motion\nconsistent with rotation. A third source, AGC 249565, lies between these two\npopulations in properties and is a possible galaxy candidate. If interpreted as\ngas-bearing dark matter halos, the three candidate galaxies have rotation\nvelocities of 8-15 km/s, HI masses of 0.6-50 x 10^5 Msun, HI radii of 0.3-2\nkpc, and dynamical masses of 2-20 x 10^7 Msun for a range of plausible\ndistances. These are the UCHVCs with the highest column density values in the\nALFALFA HI data and we suggest this is the best way to identify further\ncandidates.\n", "  In this paper, blackbody radiation (BBR) temperature rise seen by the\n$^{40}$Ca$^+$ ion confined in a miniature Paul trap and its uncertainty have\nbeen evaluated via finite-element method (FEM) modelling. The FEM model was\nvalidated by comparing with thermal camera measurements, which were calibrated\nby PT1000 resistance thermometer, at several points on a dummy trap. The input\nmodelling parameters were analyzed carefully in detail, and their contributions\nto the uncertainty of environment temperature were evaluated on the validated\nFEM model. The result shows that the temperature rise seen by $^{40}$Ca$^+$ ion\nis 1.72 K with an uncertainty of 0.46 K. It results in a contribution of 2.2\nmHz to the systematic uncertainty of $^{40}$Ca$^+$ ion optical clock,\ncorresponding to a fractional uncertainty 5.4$\\times$10$^{-18}$. This is much\nsmaller than the uncertainty caused by the BBR shift coefficient, which is\nevaluated to be 4.8 mHz and at 10$^{-17}$ level in fractional frequency units.\n", "  The KLOE-2 experiment at the INFN Laboratori Nazionali di Frascati (LNF) is\ncurrently taking data at the upgraded $e^{+}e^{-}$ DAFNE collider. Present Run\nII follows a~development phase to assess the feasibility of a long term\nacquisition program, Run I, which successfully ended in July 2015 with 1\nfb$^{-1}$ integrated luminosity collected in less than eight months. KLOE-2\nrepresents the continuation of the KLOE experiment with a new physics program.\nThe KLOE detector has undergone several upgrades including state-of-the-art\ncylindrical GEM Inner Tracker, electron-positron taggers for the\n$\\gamma\\gamma$-physics studies and new calorimeters around the interaction\npoint. In this article we briefly present the overview of the KLOE-2 experiment\nincluding the present status and achievements together with the physics plans.\n", "  We describe how the transition to synchronization in a system of globally\ncoupled Stuart-Landau oscillators changes from continuous to discontinuous when\nthe nature of the coupling is moved from diffusive to reactive. We explain this\ndrastic qualitative change as resulting from the co-existence of a particular\nsynchronized macrostate together with the trivial incoherent macrostate, in a\nrange of parameter values for which the later is linearly stable. In contrast\nto the paradigmatic Kuramoto model, this particular state observed at the\nsynchronization transition contains a finite, non-vanishing number of\nsynchronized oscillators, which results in a discontinuous transition. We\nconsider successively two situations where either a fully synchronized state or\na partially synchronized state exist at the transition. Thermodynamic limit and\nfinite size effects are briefly discussed, as well as connections with recently\nobserved discontinuous transitions.\n", "  In a Mirror Twin World with a maximally symmetric Higgs sector the little\nhierarchy of the Standard Model can be significantly mitigated, perhaps\ndisplacing the cutoff scale above the LHC reach. We show that consistency with\nobservations requires that the Z2 parity exchanging the Standard Model with its\nmirror be broken in the Yukawa couplings. A minimal such effective field\ntheory, with this sole Z2 breaking, can generate the Z2 breaking in the Higgs\nsector necessary for the Twin Higgs mechanism. The theory has constrained and\ncorrelated signals in Higgs decays, direct Dark Matter Detection and Dark\nRadiation, all within reach of foreseen experiments, over a region of parameter\nspace where the fine-tuning for the electroweak scale is 10-50%. For dark\nmatter, both mirror neutrons and a variety of self-interacting mirror atoms are\nconsidered. Neutrino mass signals and the effects of a possible additional Z2\nbreaking from the vacuum expectation values of B-L breaking fields are also\ndiscussed.\n", "  We study the high-energy behaviour of a class of anomaly-free abelian\nextensions of the Standard Model. We focus on the interplay among the\nphenomenological characterisation of the model and the use of precise\nrenormalisation group methods. Using as boundary conditions regions of the\nparameter space at the verge of current LHC probe, interesting unification\npatterns emerge linked to thresholds belonging to a SO(10) grand unification\ntheory (GUT). We stress how the evolution of the mixing between the two abelian\nfactors may provide a valuable tool to address the candidate high-energy\nembedding. The emerging unification scenarios are then challenged to be\nperturbative and to allow for a stable vacuum.\n", "  In a previous paper [J. Phys.: Conf. Ser. 682 (2016) 012032},\narXiv:1605.05593] we studied analytically the energy spectra of a finite-size\nspin $\\tfrac12$ XY chain (molecule) coupled at an arbitrary spin site to a\nsingle mode of an electromagnetic field via the Jaynes-Cummings model. We\nconsidered spin rings and open spin molecules with up to 4 spins and an\ninteraction restricted to nearest-neighbours. Here we extend our investigation,\naddressing numerically the energy spectra of molecules of up to 10 spins with\nnearest-neighbour or long-range interaction. Furthermore we analyze the\nbehaviour of an invariant operator, constructed by combining the magnetization\nof the spin-chain and the total number of photons in the system. We found a\nstrong dependence on the number (even or odd) of sites in the molecules. This\nstudy is aimed at finding the appropriate combination of the physical\nparameters that could make the system suitable for use in quantum computations.\n", "  After years of silence we should witness in the rest of this decade and in\nthe next decade the revival of kaon flavour physics. This is not only because\nof the crucial measurements of the branching ratios for the rare decays\n$K^+\\to\\pi^+\\nu\\bar\\nu$ and $K_{L}\\to \\pi^0\\nu\\bar\\nu$ by NA62 and KOTO that\nbeing theoretically clean and very sensitive to new physics (NP) could hint for\nnew phenomena even beyond the reach of the LHC without any significant\ntheoretical uncertainties. Indeed simultaneously the advances in the\ncalculations of perturbative and in particular non-perturbative QCD effects in\n$\\varepsilon'/\\varepsilon$, $\\varepsilon_K$, $\\Delta M_K$, $K_L\\to\\mu^+\\mu^-$\nand $K_L\\to\\pi^0\\ell^+\\ell^-$ will increase the role of these observables in\nsearching for NP. In fact the hints for NP contributing to\n$\\varepsilon'/\\varepsilon$ have been already signalled last year through\nimproved estimates of hadronic matrix elements of QCD and electroweak penguin\noperators $Q_6$ and $Q_8$ by lattice QCD and large $N$ dual QCD approach. This\ntalk summarizes in addition to this new flavour anomaly the present highlights\nof this field including some results from concrete NP scenarios.\n", "  Large scale Density Functional Theory (DFT) based electronic structure\ncalculations are highly time consuming and scale poorly with system size. While\nsemi-empirical approximations to DFT result in a reduction in computational\ntime versus ab initio DFT, creating such approximations involves significant\nmanual intervention and is highly inefficient for high-throughput electronic\nstructure screening calculations. In this letter, we propose the use of\nmachine-learning for fast and accurate prediction of DFT Hamiltonians. Using\nsuitable representations of atomic neighborhoods and Kernel Ridge Regression,\nwe show that an accurate and transferable prediction of DFT Hamiltonians for a\nvariety of material environments can be achieved. Electronic transmission\nspectra computed using predicted Hamiltonians compare accurately with their DFT\ncounterparts. The method is independent of the specifics of the DFT basis or\nmaterial system used and can easily be automated and scaled for predicting\nHamiltonians of any material system of interest.\n", "  We explain how a vanishing, or truncated, perturbative expansion, such as\noften arises in semi-classically tractable supersymmetric theories, can\nnevertheless be related to fluctuations about non-perturbative sectors via\nresurgence. We also demonstrate that, in the same class of theories, the\nvanishing of the ground state energy (unbroken supersymmetry) can be attributed\nto the cancellation between a real saddle and a complex saddle (with hidden\ntopological angle pi), and positivity of the ground state energy (broken\nsupersymmetry) can be interpreted as the dominance of complex saddles. In\neither case, despite the fact that the ground state energy is zero to all\norders in perturbation theory, all orders of fluctuations around\nnon-perturbative saddles are encoded in the perturbative E(N, g). We illustrate\nthese ideas with examples from supersymmetric quantum mechanics and quantum\nfield theory.\n", "  We discover that the 26D open bosonic string scattering amplitudes (SSA) of\nthree tachyons and one arbitrary string state can be expressed in terms of the\nD-type Lauricella functions with associated SL(K+3,C) symmetry. As a result,\nSSA and symmetries or relations among SSA of different string states at various\nlimits calculated previously can be rederived. These include the linear\nrelations first conjectured by Gross [1-3] and later corrected and proved in\n[4-9] in the hard scattering limit, the recurrence relations in the Regge\nscattering limit with associated SL(5,C) symmetry [19-21] and the extended\nrecurrence relations in the nonrelativistic scattering limit with associated\nSL(4,C) symmetry [24] discovered recently. Finally, as an application, we\ncalculate a new recurrence relation of SSA which is valid for all energies.\n", "  An optical frequency comb generated with an electro-optic phase modulator and\na chirped radiofrequency waveform is used to perform saturation and pump-probe\nspectroscopy on the $D_1$ and $D_2$ transitions of atomic potassium. With a\ncomb tooth spacing of 200 kHz and an optical bandwidth of 2 GHz the hyperfine\ntransitions can be simultaneously observed. Interferograms are recorded in as\nlittle as 5 $\\mu$s (a timescale corresponding to the inverse of the comb tooth\nspacing). Importantly, the sub-Doppler features can be measured as long as the\nlaser carrier frequency lies within the Doppler profile, thus removing the need\nfor slow scanning or a priori knowledge of the frequencies of the sub-Doppler\nfeatures. Sub-Doppler optical frequency comb spectroscopy has the potential to\ndramatically reduce acquisition times and allow for rapid and accurate\nassignment of complex molecular and atomic spectra which are presently\nintractable.\n", "  We consider the problem of classification of all W algebras which commute\nwith a set of exponential screening operators. Assuming that the W algebra has\na nontrivial current of spin 3, we find equations satisfied by the screening\noperators and classify their solutions.\n", "  The one-dimensional non-boost-invariant evolution of the quark-gluon plasma,\npresumably produced during the early stages of heavy-ion collisions, is\nanalyzed within the frameworks of viscous and anisotropic hydrodynamics. We\nneglect transverse dynamics and assume homogeneous conditions in the transverse\nplane but, differently from Bjorken expansion, we relax longitudinal boost\ninvariance in order to study the rapidity dependence of various hydrodynamical\nobservables. We compare the results obtained using several formulations of\nsecond-order viscous hydrodynamics with a recent approach to anisotropic\nhydrodynamics, which treats the large initial pressure anisotropy in a\nnon-perturbative fashion. The results obtained with second-order viscous\nhydrodynamics depend on the particular choice of the second-order terms\nincluded, which suggests that the latter should be included in the most\ncomplete way. The results of anisotropic hydrodynamics and viscous\nhydrodynamics agree for the central hot part of the system, however, they\ndiffer at the edges where the approach of anisotropic hydrodynamics helps to\ncontrol the undesirable growth of viscous corrections observed in standard\nframeworks.\n", "  We consider the non-equilibrium dynamics arising after a quench of the\ntransverse magnetic field of a quantum Ising chain, together with the sudden\nswitch-on of a long-range interaction term. The dynamics after the quantum\nquench is mapped onto a fully-connected model of hard-core bosons, after a\nsuitable combination of a Holstein-Primakoff transformation and of a\nlow-density expansion in the quasi-particles injected by the quench. This\nmapping holds for a broad class of initial states and for quenches which do not\ncross the critical point of the transverse field Ising model. We then study the\nalgebraic relaxation in time of a number of observables towards a metastable,\npre-thermal state, which becomes the asymptotic steady state in the\nthermodynamic limit.\n", "  We present the ${\\it Kepler}$ photometry of KIC 6048106 exhibiting O'Connell\neffect and multiperiodic pulsations. Including a starspot on either of the\ncomponents, light-curve synthesis indicates that this system is a semi-detached\nAlgol with a mass ratio of 0.211, an orbital inclination of 73.9 deg, and a\nlarge temperature difference of 2,534 K. To examine in detail both spot\nvariations and pulsations, we separately analyzed the {\\it Kepler} time-series\ndata at the interval of an orbital period by an iterative way. The results\nreveal that the variable asymmetries of the light maxima can be interpreted as\nthe changes of a magnetic cool spot on the secondary component with time.\nMultiple frequency analyses were performed in the outside-eclipse light\nresiduals after removal of the binarity effects from the observed {\\it Kepler}\ndata. We detected 30 frequencies with signal to noise amplitude ratios larger\nthan 4.0, of which six ($f_2$--$f_6$ and $f_{10}$) can be identified as\nhigh-order (17 $\\le n \\le$ 25) low-degree ($\\ell$ = 2) gravity-mode pulsations\nthat were stable during the observing run of 200 d. In contrast, the other\nfrequencies may be harmonic and combination terms. For the six frequencies, the\npulsation periods and pulsation constants are in the ranges of 0.352$-$0.506 d\nand 0.232$-$0.333 d, respectively. These values and the position on the HR\ndiagram demonstrate that the primary star is a $\\gamma$ Dor variable. The\nevolutionary status and the pulsation nature of KIC 6048106 are discussed.\n", "  We present the stellar kinematic maps of a large sample of galaxies from the\nintegral-field spectroscopic survey CALIFA. The sample comprises 300 galaxies\ndisplaying a wide range of morphologies across the Hubble sequence, from\nellipticals to late-type spirals. This dataset allows us to homogeneously\nextract stellar kinematics up to several effective radii. In this paper, we\ndescribe the level of completeness of this subset of galaxies with respect to\nthe full CALIFA sample, as well as the virtues and limitations of the kinematic\nextraction compared to other well-known integral-field surveys. In addition, we\nprovide averaged integrated velocity dispersion radial profiles for different\ngalaxy types, which are particularly useful to apply aperture corrections for\nsingle aperture measurements or poorly resolved stellar kinematics of\nhigh-redshift sources. The work presented in this paper sets the basis for the\nstudy of more general properties of galaxies that will be explored in\nsubsequent papers of the survey.\n", "  The peculiar role of heavy-flavour observables in relativistic heavy-ion\ncollisions is discussed. Produced in the early stage, $c$ and $b$ quarks cross\nthe hot medium arising from the collision, interacting strongly with the\nlatter, until they hadronize. Depending on the strength of the interaction\nheavy quarks may or not approach kinetic equilibrium with the plasma, tending\nin the first case to follow the collective flow of the expanding fireball. The\npresence of a hot deconfined medium may also affect heavy-quark hadronization,\nbeing possible for them to recombine with the surrounding light thermal\npartons, so that the final heavy-flavour hadrons inherit part of the flow of\nthe medium. Here we show how it is possible to develop a complete transport\nsetup allowing one to describe heavy-flavour production in high-energy nuclear\ncollisions, displaying some major results one can obtain. Finally, the\npossibility that the formation of a hot deconfined medium even in small systems\n(high-multiplicity p-Au and d-Au collisions, so far) may affect also\nheavy-flavour observables is investigated.\n", "  We explore an alternative discretization of continuum SU(N_c) Yang-Mills\ntheory on a Euclidean spacetime lattice, originally introduced by Budzcies and\nZirnbauer. In this discretization the self-interactions of the gauge field are\ninduced by a path integral over N_b auxiliary boson fields, which are coupled\nlinearly to the gauge field. The main progress compared to earlier approaches\nis that N_b can be as small as N_c. In the present paper we (i) extend the\nproof that the continuum limit of the new discretization reproduces Yang-Mills\ntheory in two dimensions from gauge group U(N_c) to SU(N_c), (ii) derive\nrefined bounds on N_b for non-integer values, and (iii) perform a perturbative\ncalculation to match the bare parameter of the induced gauge theory to the\nstandard lattice coupling. In follow-up papers we will present numerical\nevidence in support of the conjecture that the induced gauge theory reproduces\nYang-Mills theory also in three and four dimensions, and explore the\npossibility to integrate out the gauge fields to arrive at a dual formulation\nof lattice QCD.\n", "  Fluid simulation of stellarator edge transport is difficult due to the\ncomplexities of mesh generation; the stochastic edge and strong nonaxisymmetry\ninhibit the use of field aligned coordinate systems. The recent implementation\nof the Flux Coordinate Independent method for calculating parallel derivatives\nin BOUT++ has allowed for more complex geometries. Here we present initial\nresults of nonaxisymmetric diffusion modelling as a step towards stellarator\nturbulence modelling. We then present initial (non-turbulent) transport\nmodelling using the FCI method and compare the results with analytical\ncalculations. The prospects for future stellarator transport and turbulence\nmodelling are discussed.\n", "  The Massive Young Star Forming Complex in Infrared and X-ray (MYStIX) project\nprovides a new census on stellar members of massive star forming regions within\n4 kpc. Here the MYStIX Infrared Excess catalog (MIRES) and Chandra-based X-ray\nphotometric catalogs are mined to obtain high-quality samples of Class I\nprotostars using criteria designed to reduce extragalactic and Galactic field\nstar contamination. A total of 1,109 MYStIX Candidate Protostars (MCPs) are\nfound in 14 star forming regions. Most are selected from protoplanetary disk\ninfrared excess emission, but 20% are found from their ultrahard X-ray spectra\nfrom heavily absorbed magnetospheric flare emission. Two-thirds of the MCP\nsample is newly reported here. The resulting samples are strongly spatially\nassociated with molecular cores and filaments on Herschel far-infrared maps.\nThis spatial agreement and other evidence indicate that the MCP sample has high\nreliability with relatively few 'false positives' from contaminating\npopulations. But the limited sensitivity and sparse overlap among the infrared\nand X-ray subsamples indicate that the sample is very incomplete with many\n'false negatives'. Maps, tables, and source descriptions are provided to guide\nfurther study of star formation in these regions. In particular, the nature of\nultrahard X-ray protostellar candidates without known infrared counterparts\nneeds to be eludicated.\n", "  We present an improved determination of the $\\pi\\pi$ continuum contribution\nto the isovector spectral functions of the nucleon electromagnetic form\nfactors. Our analysis includes the most up-to-date results for the\n$\\pi\\pi\\to\\bar N N$ partial waves extracted from Roy-Steiner equations,\nconsistent input for the pion vector form factor, and a thorough discussion of\nisospin-violating effects and uncertainty estimates. As an application, we\nconsider the $\\pi\\pi$ contribution to the isovector electric and magnetic radii\nby means of sum rules, which, in combination with the accurately known neutron\nelectric radius, are found to slightly prefer a small proton charge radius.\n", "  Inspired by recent simulations on highly open liquid crystalline structures\nformed by rigid planar nanorings we present a simple theoretical framework\nexplaining the prevalence of smectic over nematic ordering in systems of\nring-shaped objects. The key part of our study is a calculation of the excluded\nvolume of such non-convex particles in the limit of vanishing thickness to\ndiameter ratio. Using a simple stability analysis we then show that dilute\nsystems of ring-shaped particles have a strong propensity to order into smectic\nstructures with an unusual antinematic order while solid disks of the same\ndimensions exhibit nematic order. Since our model rings have zero internal\nvolume these smectic structures are essential empty, resembling the strongly\nporous structures found in simulation. We argue that the antinematic\nintralamellar order of the rings plays an essential role in stabilizing these\nnovel smectic structures.\n", "  We evaluate the electromagnetic spectral function in QCD plasma in a\nnonperturbative background of in-medium quark and gluon condensates by\nincorporating the leading order power corrections in a systematic framework\nwithin the ambit of the operator product expansion in D=4 dimension. We\nexplicitly show that the mixing of the composite operators removes mass\nsingularities and renders Wilson coefficients finite and well defined. As a\nspectral property, we then obtain the nonperturbative dilepton production rate\nfrom QCD plasma. The operator product expansion automatically restricts the\ndilepton rate to the intermediate mass range, which is found to be enhanced due\nto the power corrections. We also compare our result with those from\nnonperturbative calculations, e.g., lattice QCD and effective QCD models based\non Polyakov loop.\n", "  Recently synthesized NdFe12N has excellent magnetic properties, while it is\nthermodynamically unstable. Using first-principles method, we study the effect\nof substitutional 3d transition metal elements to the mother compound NdFe12.\nWe find that Co has positive effect on the stability of the ThMn12 structure.\nIn contrast with Ti substitution, Co substitution does not reduce the\nmagnetization significantly. The crystal field parameter <r^{2}>A_{0}^{2} is\nnearly unchanged by Co substitution, and nitrogenation to NdFe11Co greatly\nenhances <r^{2}>A_{0}^{2}. This suggests that Co is a good candidate as a\nsubstitutional element for NdFe12N.\n", "  In addition to their anomalous abundances, 3He-rich solar energetic particles\n(SEPs) show puzzling energy spectral shapes varying from rounded forms to power\nlaws where the later are characteristics of shock acceleration. Solar sources\nof these particles have been often associated with jets and narrow CMEs, which\nare the signatures of magnetic reconnection involving open field. Recent\nreports on new associations with large-scale EUV waves bring new insights on\nacceleration and transport of 3He-rich SEPs in the corona. We examined energy\nspectra for 32 3He-rich SEP events observed by ACE at L1 near solar minimum in\n2007-2010 and compared the spectral shapes with solar flare signatures obtained\nfrom STEREO EUV images. We found the events with jets or brightenings tend to\nbe associated with rounded spectra and the events with coronal waves with power\nlaws. This suggests that coronal waves may be related to the unknown second\nstage mechanism commonly used to interpret spectral forms of 3He-rich SEPs.\n", "  $k$-Core percolation has served as a paradigmatic model of discontinuous\npercolation for a long time. Recently it was revealed that the order parameter\nof $k$-core percolation of random networks additionally exhibits critical\nbehavior. Thus $k$-core percolation exhibits a hybrid phase transition. Unlike\nthe critical behaviors of ordinary percolation that are well understood, those\nof hybrid percolation transitions have not been thoroughly understood yet.\nHere, we investigate the critical behavior of $k$-core percolation of\nErd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi networks. We find numerically that the fluctuations of the\norder parameter and the mean avalanche size diverge in different ways. Thus, we\nclassify the critical exponents into two types: those associated with the order\nparameter and those with finite avalanches. The conventional scaling relations\nhold within each set, however, these two critical exponents are coupled.\nFinally we discuss some universal features of the critical behaviors of\n$k$-core percolation and the cascade failure model on multiplex networks.\n", "  A double-correlation method is introduced to locate tremor sources based on\nstacks of complex, doubly-correlated tremor records of multiple triplets of\nseismographs back projected to hypothetical source locations in a geographic\ngrid. Peaks in the resulting stack of moduli are inferred source locations. The\nstack of the moduli is a robust measure of energy radiated from a point source\nor point sources even when the velocity information is imprecise. Application\nto real data shows how double correlation focuses the source mapping compared\nto the common single correlation approach. Synthetic tests demonstrate the\nrobustness of the method and its resolution limitations which are controlled by\nthe station geometry, the finite frequency of the signal, the quality of the\nused velocity information and noise level. Both random noise and signal or\nnoise correlated at time shifts that are inconsistent with the assumed velocity\nstructure can be effectively suppressed. Assuming a surface-wave velocity, we\ncan constrain the source location even if the surface-wave component does not\ndominate. The method can also in principle be used with body waves in three\ndimensions, although this requires more data and seismographs placed near the\nsource for depth resolution.\n", "  We infer distances and their asymmetric uncertainties for two million stars\nusing the parallaxes published in the Gaia DR1 (GDR1) catalogue. We do this\nwith two distance priors: A minimalist, isotropic prior assuming an\nexponentially decreasing space density with increasing distance, and an\nanisotropic prior derived from the observability of stars in a Milky Way model.\nWe validate our results by comparing our distance estimates for 105 Cepheids\nwhich have more precise, independently estimated distances. For this sample we\nfind that the Milky Way prior performs better (the RMS of the scaled residuals\nis 0.40) than the exponentially decreasing space density prior (RMS is 0.57),\nalthough for distances beyond 2 kpc the Milky Way prior performs worse, with a\nbias in the scaled residuals of -0.36 (vs. -0.07 for the exponentially\ndecreasing space density prior). We do not attempt to include the photometric\ndata in GDR1 due to the lack of reliable colour information. Our distance\ncatalogue is available at http://www.mpia.de/homes/calj/tgas\ndistances/main.html as well as at CDS. This should only be used to give\nindividual distances. Combining data or testing models should be done with the\noriginal parallaxes, and attention paid to correlated and systematic\nuncertainties.\n", "  Models of star formation in the early universe depend on the details of\naccretion, fragmentation and radiative feedback. Different simulations predict\ndifferent initial mass functions of the first stars, ranging from predominantly\nlow mass (0.1-10 Msol), to massive (10-100 Msol), or even supermassive\n(100-1000 Msol). The mass distribution of the first stars should lead to unique\nchemical imprints on the low-mass second and later generation metal-poor stars\nstill in existence. The chemical composition of SMSS0313-6708, which has the\nlowest abundances of Ca and Fe of any star known, indicates it was enriched by\na single massive supernova. However, even weak spectral lines may be affected\nby strong 3D and NLTE effects in metal-poor stars. If these effects are ignored\nor treated incorrectly, errors in the inferred abundances may significantly\nbias the inferred properties of the polluting supernovae. We redetermine the\nchemical composition of SMSS0313-6708 using 3D NLTE radiative transfer to\nobtain accurate abundances for Li, Na, Mg, Al, Ca and Fe. The model atoms\nemploy realistic collisional rates, with no calibrated free parameters. We find\nsignificantly higher abundances in 3D NLTE than 1D LTE by 0.8 dex for Fe, and\n0.5 dex for Mg, Al and Ca, while Li and Na are unaffected to within 0.03 dex.\nIn particular, our upper limit for [Fe/H] is now a factor ten larger, at [Fe/H]\n< -6.53 (3 sigma), than previous estimates based on <3D> NLTE (i.e. using\naveraged 3D models). This higher estimate is due to a conservative upper limit\nestimation, updated NLTE data, and 3D-<3D> NLTE differences, all of which lead\nto a higher abundance determination. We find that the revised chemical\ncomposition of SMSS0313-6708 matches supernova yields for massive progenitors\nof 20-60 Msol exploding with low energies (1-2 x 10^51 erg), as well as\nprogenitors of 10 Msol with very low explosion energies (< 10^51 erg).\n", "  The Gaia-ESO survey recently reported on a large sample of lithium (Li)\nabundance determinations for evolved stars in the rich open cluster Trumpler\n20. They argue for a scenario where virtually all stars experience post main\nsequence mixing and Li is preserved in only two objects. We present an\nalternate explanation, where Li is normal in the vast majority of cluster stars\nand anomalously high in these two cases. We demonstrate that the Li upper\nlimits in the red giants can be explained with a combination of main sequence\ndepletion and standard dredge-up, and that they are close to the detected\nlevels in other systems of similar age. In our framework, the two detected\ngiants are anomalously Li-rich, and we propose that both could have been\nproduced by the engulfment of a substellar mass companion of 16(+6-10) M_J.\nThis would imply that ~5% of 1.8 solar mass stars in this system, and by\nextension elsewhere, should have substellar mass companions of high mass that\ncould be engulfed at some point in their lifetimes. We discuss future tests\nthat could confirm or refute this scenario.\n", "  We present late-time observations of the site of the Type Ibn supernova (SN)\n2006jc acquired with the Hubble Space Telescope Advanced Camera for Surveys. A\nfaint blue source is recovered at the SN position with brightness\n$m_{F435W}=26.76\\pm0.20$, $m_{F555W}=26.60\\pm0.23$ and $m_{F625W} =\n26.32\\pm0.19$ mags, although there is no detection in a contemporaneous\nnarrow-band $\\mathrm{H\\alpha}$ image. The spectral energy distribution of the\nlate-time source is well fit by a stellar-like spectrum ($\\log T_{eff} > 3.7$\nand $\\log L / L_{\\odot} > 4$) subject to only a small degree of reddening\nconsistent with that estimated for SN~2006jc itself at early-times. The lack of\nfurther outbursts after the explosion of SN~2006jc suggests that the precursor\noutburst originated from the progenitor. The possibility of the source being a\ncompact host cluster is ruled out on the basis of the source's faintness,\nhowever the possibility that the late-time source maybe an unresolved light\necho originating in a shell or sphere of pre-SN dust (within a radius\n$1\\mathrm{pc}$) is also discussed. Irrespective of the nature of the late-time\nsource, these observations rule out a luminous blue variable as a companion to\nthe progenitor of SN~2006jc.\n", "  Surfaces of ionic solids interacting with an ionic solution can build up\ncharge by exchange of ions. The surface charge is compensated by a strip of\nexcess charge at the border of the electrolyte forming an electric double\nlayer. These electric double layers are very hard to model using the supercells\nmethods of computational condensed phase science. The problem arises when the\nsolid is an electric insulator (as most ionic solids are) permitting a finite\ninterior electric field over the width of the slab representing the solid in\nthe supercell. The slab acts as a capacitor. The stored charge is a deficit in\nthe solution failing to compensate fully for the solid surface charge. Here we\nshow how these problems can be overcome using the finite field methods\ndeveloped by Stengel, Spaldin and Vanderbilt [Nat. Phys. {\\bf 5}, 304, (2009)].\nWe also show how the capacitance of the double layer can be computed once\noverall electric neutrality of the double layer is restored by application of a\nfinite macroscopic field $\\mathbf{E}$ or alternatively by zero electric\ndisplacement $\\mathbf{D}$. The method is validated for a classical model of a\nsolid-electrolyte interface using the finite temperature molecular dynamics\nadaptation of the constant field method presented previously [Phys. Rev. B,\n2016, 93, 144201]. Because ions in electrolytes can diffuse across supercell\nboundaries, this application turns out to be a critical illustration of the\nmultivaluedness of polarization in periodic systems.\n", "  Typical Weyl semimetals host chiral surface states and hence show an\nanomalous Hall response. Although a Weyl semimetal phase is known to be robust\nagainst weak disorder, the influence of disorder on chiral states is not fully\nclarified so far. We study the behavior of such chiral states in the presence\nof disorder and its consequences on an anomalous Hall response, focusing on a\nthin slab of Weyl semimetal with chiral surface states along its edge. It is\nshown that weak disorder does not disrupt chiral edge states but crucially\naffects them owing to the renormalization of a mass parameter: the number of\nchiral edge states changes depending on the strength of disorder. It is also\nshown that the Hall conductance is quantized when the Fermi level is located\nnear Weyl nodes within a finite-size gap. This quantization of the Hall\nconductance collapses once the strength of disorder exceeds a critical value,\nsuggesting that it serves as a probe to distinguish a Weyl semimetal phase from\na diffusive anomalous Hall metal phase.\n", "  X-ray single-photon ionization and fragmentation of the chiral molecule\nhalothane (CHBrClCF${}_{3}$) from a racemic mixture have been investigated\nusing the COLTRIMS (Cold Target Recoil Ion Momentum Spectroscopy) technique.\nTwo important facets related to the core ionization of this species are\nexamined: Firstly, the distinction of enantiomers (mirror isomers) and the\ndetermination of absolute configuration on a single-molecule level by four-body\nCoulomb explosion; secondly, the interplay of site-selective excitation and\nfragmentation patterns. These results are easily transferrable to other\nmolecular species and show the wealth of features\n", "  We calculate the Casimir energy of a massless scalar field in a cavity formed\nby nearby parallel plates orbiting a rotating spherical body surrounded by\nquintessence, investigating the influence of the gravitational field on that\nenergy, at zero temperature. This influence includes the effects due to the\nspacetime dragging caused by the source rotation as well as those ones due to\nthe quintessence. We show that the energy depends on all the involved\nparameters, as source mass, angular momentum and quintessence state parameter,\nfor any radial coordinate and polar angle. We show that at the north pole the\nCasimir energy is not influenced by the quintessential matter. At the\nequatorial plane, when the quintessence is canceled, the result obtained in the\nliterature is recovered. Finally, constraints in the quintessence parameters\nare obtained from the uncertainty in the current measurements of Casimir\neffect.\n", "  We present a precise calculation of the Lamb shift $(2P_{1/2}-2S_{1/2})$ in\nmuonic ions $(\\mu ^6_3Li)^{2+},~(\\mu ^7_3Li)^{2+}$, $(\\mu ^9_4Be)^{3+},~(\\mu\n^{10}_4Be)^{3+}$, $(\\mu ^{10}_5B)^{4+},~(\\mu ^{11}_5B)^{4+}$. The contributions\nof orders $\\alpha^3\\div\\alpha^6$ to the vacuum polarization, nuclear structure\nand recoil, relativistic effects are taken into account. Our numerical results\nare consistent with previous calculations and improve them due to account of\nnew corrections. The obtained results can be used for the comparison with\nfuture experimental data, and extraction more accurate values of nuclear charge\nradii.\n", "  Gaia is a space mission currently measuring the five astrometric parameters\nas well as spectrophotometry of at least 1 billion stars to G = 20.7 mag with\nunprecedented precision. The sixth parameter in phase space (radial velocity)\nis also measured thanks to medium-resolution spectroscopy being obtained for\nthe 150 million brightest stars. During the commissioning phase, two fields,\none around each ecliptic pole, have been repeatedly observed to assess and to\nimprove the overall satellite performances as well as the associated reduction\nand analysis software. A ground-based photometric and spectroscopic survey was\ntherefore initiated in 2007, and is still running in order to gather as much\ninformation as possible about the stars in these fields. This work is of\nparticular interest to the validation of the Radial Velocity Spectrometer (RVS)\noutputs. The paper presents the radial velocity measurements performed for the\nSouthern targets in the 12 - 17 R magnitude range on high- to mid-resolution\nspectra obtained with the GIRAFFE and UVES spectrographs.\n", "  Glueballs are predicted in various theoretical approaches of QCD (most\nnotably lattice QCD), but their experimental verification is still missing. In\nthe low-energy sector some promising candidate for the scalar glueball exist,\nand some (less clear) candidates for the tensor and pseudoscalar glueballs were\nalso proposed. Yet, for heavier gluonic states there is much work to be done\nboth from the experimental and theoretical points of view. In these\nproceedings, we briefly review the current status of research of glueballs and\ndiscuss future developments.\n", "  Optoacoustic tomography (OAT), also known as photoacoustic tomography, is a\nrapidly emerging hybrid imaging technique that possesses great potential for a\nwide range of biomedical imaging applications. In OAT, a laser is employed to\nilluminate the tissue of interest and acoustic signals are produced via the\nphotoacoustic effect. From these data, an estimate of the distribution of the\nabsorbed optical energy density within the tissue is reconstructed, referred to\nas the object function. This quantity is defined, in part, by the distribution\nof light fluence within the tissue that is established by the laser source.\nWhen performing three-dimensional imaging of large objects, such as a female\nhuman breast, it can be difficult to achieve a relatively uniform coverage of\nlight fluence within the volume of interest when the position of the laser\nsource is fixed. To circumvent this, researchers have proposed illumination\nschemes in which the relative position of the laser source and ultrasound probe\nis fixed, and both are rotated together to acquire a tomographic data set. A\nproblem with this rotating-illumination scheme is that the tomographic data are\ninconsistent; namely, the acoustic data recorded at each tomographic view angle\n(i.e., probe position) are produced by a distinct object function. In this\nwork, the impact of this data inconsistency on image reconstruction accuracy is\ninvestigated systematically. This is accomplished by use of computer-simulation\nstudies and application of mathematical results from the theory of microlocal\nanalysis. These studies specify the set of image discontinuities that can be\nstably reconstructed with a non-stationary optical illumination set-up. The\nstudy also includes a comparison of the ability of iterative and analytic image\nreconstruction methods to mitigate artifacts attributable to the data\ninconsistency.\n", "  We present an analytical and numerical study of multiple-laser QED cascades\ninduced with linearly polarised laser pulses. We analyse different polarisation\norientations and propose a configuration that maximises the cascade\nmultiplicity and favours the laser absorption. We generalise the analytical\nestimate for the cascade growth rate previously calculated in the field of two\ncolliding linearly polarised laser pulses and account for multiple laser\ninteraction. The estimate is verified by a comprehensive numerical study of\nfour-laser QED cascades across a range of different laser intensities with QED\nPIC module of OSIRIS. We show that by using four linearly polarised 30 fs laser\npulses, one can convert more than 50 % of the total energy to gamma-rays\nalready at laser intensity $I\\simeq10^{24}\\ \\mathrm{W/cm^2}$. In this\nconfiguration, the laser conversion efficiency is higher compared with the case\nwith two colliding lasers.\n", "  We compute the vacuum expectation values of $1/6$ supersymmetric Wilson loops\nin higher dimensional representations of the gauge group in ABJM theory. We\npresent results for the $m$-symmetric and $m$-antisymmetric representations by\nexploiting standard matrix model techniques. At leading order, in the saddle\npoint approximation, our expressions reproduce holographic results from both D6\nand D2 branes corresponding to the antisymmetric and symmetric representations,\nrespectively. We also compute 1/N corrections to the leading saddle point\nresults.\n", "  We study the effect of a shift of the chemical potential level on the\ntunneling conductance spectra. In the systems with gapped energy spectra,\nsignificant chemical-potential dependent distortions of the differential\ntunneling conductance curves, $dI/dV$, arise in the gap region. An expression\nis derived for the correction of the $dI/dV$, which in a number of cases was\nfound to be large. The sign of the correction depends on the chemical potential\nlevel position with respect to the gap. The correction of the $dI/dV$\nassociated with the chemical potential shift has a nearly linear dependence on\nthe tip-sample separation $z$ and vanishes at $z\\to 0$.\n", "  Galaxy clusters undergo mergers that can generate extended radio sources\ncalled radio relics. Radio relics are the consequence of merger-induced shocks\nthat propagate in the intra cluster medium (ICM). In this paper we analyse the\nradio, optical and X-ray data from a candidate galaxy cluster that has been\nselected from the radio emission coming from a candidate radio relic detected\nin NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS). Our aim is to clarify the nature of this source\nand prove that under certain conditions radio emission from radio relics can be\nused to trace relatively low-mass galaxy clusters. We have observed the\ncandidate galaxy cluster with the Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope (GMRT) at\nthree different frequencies. These datasets have been analysed together with\narchival data from ROSAT in the X-ray and with archival data from the Gamma-Ray\nBurst Optical/Near-Infrared Detector (GROND) telescope in four different\noptical bands. We confirm the presence of a 1 Mpc long radio relic located in\nthe outskirts of a previously unknown galaxy cluster. We confirm the presence\nof the galaxy cluster through dedicated optical observations and using archival\nX-ray data. Due to its proximity and similar redshift to a known Abell cluster,\nwe named it: Abell 3527-bis. The galaxy cluster is among the least massive\ncluster known to host a radio relic. We showed that radio relics can be\neffectively used to trace a subset of relatively low-mass galaxy clusters that\nmight have gone undetected in X-ray or Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) surveys. This\ntechnique might be used in future deep, low-frequency surveys as those carried\non by LOFAR, uGMRT and, ultimately, SKA.\n", "  We discuss the prompt production of $J/\\psi$ mesons in proton-proton\ncollisions at the LHC within a NRQCD $k_{t}$-factorization approach using\nKimber-Martin-Ryskin (KMR) unintegrated gluon distributions (UGDF). We include\nboth direct color-singlet production ($gg \\to J/\\psi$g) as well as a feed-down\nfrom $\\chi_{c} \\to J/\\psi \\gamma$ and $\\psi' \\to J/\\psi X$. The production of\nthe decaying mesons ($\\chi_{c}$ or $\\psi'$)is also calculated within NRQCD\n$k_{t}$-factorization. The corresponding matrix elements for $gg \\to J/\\psi$,\n$gg \\to \\psi'$ and $gg \\to \\chi_{c}$ include parameters of the nonrelativistic\nspatial wave functions of quarkonia at $r=0$, which are taken from potential\nmodels from the literature. We get the ratio of the corresponding of the cross\nsections for $\\chi_{c}(2)$-to-$\\chi_{c}(1)$ much closer to experimental data\nthan obtained in recent analyses. Differential distributions in rapidity of\n$J/\\psi$ and $\\psi'$ are calculated and compared to experimental data of the\nALICE and LHCb collaborations. We discuss possible onset of gluon saturation\neffects at forward/backward rapidities. One can describe the experimental data\nfor $J/\\psi$ production within model uncertainties with color-singlet component\nonly. Therefore our theoretical results leave only a relatively small room for\nthe color-octet contributions.\n", "  Networks of contacts capable of spreading infectious diseases are often\nobserved to be highly heterogeneous, with the majority of individuals having\nfewer contacts than the mean, and a significant minority having relatively very\nmany contacts. We derive a two-dimensional diffusion model for the full\ntemporal behavior of the stochastic susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR)\nmodel on such a network, by making use of a time-scale separation in the\ndeterministic limit of the dynamics. This low-dimensional process is an\naccurate approximation to the full model in the limit of large populations,\neven for cases when the time-scale separation is not too pronounced, provided\nthe maximum degree is not of the order of the population size.\n", "  We derive the mass formulae for ${\\cal N}=1$, $D=4$ matter-coupled\nSupergravity for broken (and unbroken) Supersymmetry in curved space-time.\nThese formulae are applicable to de Sitter configurations as is the case for\ninflation. For unbroken Supersymmetry in anti-de Sitter (AdS) one gets the mass\nrelations modified by the AdS curvature. We compute the mass relations both for\nthe potential and its derivative non-vanishing.\n", "  Sudden singularities occur in FRW spacetimes when the scale factor remains\nfinite and different from zero while some of its derivatives diverge. After\nproper rescaling, the scale factor close to such a singularity at $t=0$ takes\nthe form $a(t)=1+ c |t|^\\eta$ (where $c$ and $\\eta$ are parameters and\n$\\eta\\geq 0$). We investigate analytically and numerically the geodesics of\nfree and gravitationally bound particles through such sudden singularities. We\nfind that even though free particle geodesics go through sudden singularities\nfor all $\\eta\\geq 0$, bound systems get dissociated for a wide range of the\nparameter $c$. For $\\eta <1$ bound particles receive a diverging impulse at the\nsingularity and get dissociated for all positive values of the parameter $c$.\nFor $\\eta > 1$ (Sudden Future Singularities (SFS)) bound systems get a finite\nimpulse that depends on the value of $c$ and get dissociated for values of $c$\nlarger than a critical value $c_{cr}(\\eta,\\omega_0)>0$ that increases with the\nvalue of $\\eta$ and the rescaled angular velocity $\\omega_0$ of the bound\nsystem. We obtain an approximate equation for the analytical estimate of\n$c_{cr}(\\eta,\\omega_0)$. We also obtain its accurate form by numerical\nderivation of the bound system orbits through the singularities. Bound system\norbits through Big Brake singularities ($c<0$, $1<\\eta<2$) are also derived\nnumerically and are found to get disrupted at the singularity. However, they\nremain bound for all values of the parameter $c$ considered.\n", "  We show for the first time that sustained turbulence is possible at low\nmagnetic Prandtl number for Keplerian flows with no mean magnetic flux. Our\nresults indicate that increasing the vertical domain size is equivalent to\nincreasing the dynamical range between the energy injection scale and the\ndissipative scale. This has important implications for a large variety of\ndifferentially rotating systems with low magnetic Prandtl number such as\nprotostellar disks and laboratory experiments.\n", "  We present the first spectroscopic studies of the $C \\ ^1\\Sigma^+$ electronic\nstate and the $A \\ ^1\\Sigma^+$ - $b \\ ^3\\Pi_{0^+}$ complex in $^7$Li -\n$^{85}$Rb. Using resonantly-enhanced, two-photon ionization, we observed $v =\n7$, 9, 12, 13 and $26-44$ of the $C \\ ^1\\Sigma^+$ state. We augment the REMPI\ndata with a form of depletion spectra in regions of dense spectral lines. The\n$A \\ ^1\\Sigma^+$ - $b \\ ^3\\Pi_{0^+}$ complex was observed with depletion\nspectroscopy, depleting to vibrational levels $v=0 \\rightarrow 29$ of the $A \\\n^1\\Sigma^+$ state and $v=8 \\rightarrow 18$ of the $b \\ ^3\\Pi_{0^+}$ state. For\nall three series, we determine the term energy and vibrational constants.\nFinally, we outline several possible future projects based on the data\npresented here.\n", "  The theoretical description of synchronization phenomena often relies on\ncoupled units of continuous time noisy Markov chains with a small number of\nstates in each unit. It is frequently assumed, either explicitly or implicitly,\nthat coupled discrete-state noisy Markov units can be used to model\nmathematically more complex coupled noisy continuous phase oscillators. In this\nwork we explore conditions that justify this assumption by coarse-graining\ncontinuous phase units. In particular, we determine the minimum number of\nstates necessary to justify this correspondence for Kuramoto-like oscillators.\n", "  We present stacking analyses on our ALMA deep 1.1 mm imaging in the SXDF\nusing 1.6 {\\mu}m and 3.6 {\\mu}m selected galaxies in the CANDELS WFC3 catalog.\nWe detect a stacked flux of ~0.03-0.05 mJy, corresponding to LIR < 10^11 Lsun\nand a star formation rate (SFR) of ~ 15 Msun/yr at z = 2. We find that galaxies\nbrighter in the rest-frame near-infrared tend to be also brighter at 1.1 mm,\nand galaxies fainter than m[3.6um] = 23 do not produce detectable 1.1 mm\nemission. This suggests a correlation between stellar mass and SFR, but\noutliers to this correlation are also observed, suggesting strongly boosted\nstar formation or extremely large extinction. We also find tendencies that\nredder galaxies and galaxies at higher redshifts are brighter at 1.1 mm. Our\nfield contains z ~ 2.5 H-alpha emitters and a bright single-dish source.\nHowever, we do not find evidence of bias in our results caused by the bright\nsource. By combining the fluxes of sources detected by ALMA and fluxes of faint\nsources detected with stacking, we recover a 1.1 mm surface brightness of up to\n20.3 +/- 1.2 Jy/deg, comparable to the extragalactic background light measured\nby COBE. Based on the fractions of optically faint sources in our and previous\nALMA studies and the COBE measurements, we find that approximately half of the\ncosmic star formation may be obscured by dust and missed by deep optical\nsurveys, Much deeper and wider ALMA imaging is therefore needed to better\nconstrain the obscured cosmic star formation history.\n", "  The hyperfine field $B_\\text{hf}$ and the magnetic properties of the\nBaFe$_2$As$_2$ family are studied using the fully relativistic Dirac formalism\nfor different types of substitution. The study covers electron doped\nBa(Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_x$)$_2$As$_2$ and Ba(Fe$_{1-x}$Ni$_x$)$_2$As$_2$, hole doped\n(Ba$_{1-x}$K$_x$)Fe$_2$As$_2$ and also isovalently doped\nBa(Fe$_{1-x}$Ru$_x$)$_2$As$_2$ and BaFe$_2$(As$_{1-x}$P$_x$)$_2$ for a wide\nrange of the concentration $x$. For the substituted compounds the hyperfine\nfields show a very strong dependence on the dopant type and its concentration\n$x$. Relativistic contributions were found to have a significantly stronger\nimpact for the iron pnictides when compared to bulk Fe. As an important\nfinding, we demonstrate that it is not sensible to relate the hyperfine field\n$B_\\text{hf}$ to the average magnetic moment $\\mu$ of the compound, as it was\ndone in earlier literature.\n", "  ALPS II is a light shining through a wall style experiment that will use the\nprinciple of resonant enhancement to boost the conversion and reconversion\nprobabilities of photons to relativistic WISPs. This will require the use of\nlong baseline low-loss optical cavities. Very high power build up factors in\nthe cavities must be achieved in order to reach the design sensitivity of ALPS\nII. This necessitates a number of different sophisticated optical and control\nsystems to maintain the resonance and ensure maximal coupling between the laser\nand the cavity. In this paper we report on the results of the characterization\nof these optical systems with a 20 m cavity and discuss the results in the\ncontext of ALPS II.\n", "  The non-Markovian dynamics of open quantum systems is still a challenging\ntask, particularly in the non-perturbative regime at low temperatures. While\nthe Stochastic Liouville-von Neumann equation (SLN) provides a formally exact\ntool to tackle this problem for both discrete and continuous degrees of\nfreedom, its performance deteriorates for long times due to an inherently\nnon-unitary propagator. Here we present a scheme which combines the SLN with\nprojector operator techniques based on finite dephasing times, gaining\nsubstantial improvements in terms of memory storage and statistics. The\napproach allows for systematic convergence and is applicable in regions of\nparameter space where perturbative methods fail, up to the long time domain.\nFindings are applied to the coherent and incoherent quantum dynamics of two-\nand three-level systems. In the long time domain sequential and super-exchange\ntransfer rates are extracted and compared to perturbative predictions.\n", "  Recently there have been experimental results on Poisson spot matter wave\ninterferometry followed by theoretical models describing the relative\nimportance of the wave and particle behaviors for the phenomenon. We propose an\nanalytical theoretical model for the Poisson's spot with matter waves based on\nBabinet principle in which we use the results for a free propagation and single\nslit diffraction. We take into account effects of loss of coherence and finite\ndetection area using the propagator for a quantum particle interacting with an\nenvironment. We observe that the matter wave Gouy phase plays a role in the\nexistence of the central peak and thus corroborates the predominantly wavelike\ncharacter of the Poisson's spot. Our model shows remarkable agreement with the\nexperimental data for deuterium ($D_{2}$) molecules.\n", "  On behalf of the International Astronomical Consortium for High Energy\nCalibration (IACHEC), we present results from the cross-calibration campaigns\nin 2012 on 3C 273 and in 2013 on PKS 2155-304 between the then active X-ray\nobservatories Chandra, NuSTAR, Suzaku, Swift and XMM-Newton. We compare\nmeasured fluxes between instrument pairs in two energy bands, 1-5 keV and 3-7\nkeV and calculate an average cross-normalization constant for each energy\nrange. We review known cross-calibration features and provide a series of\ntables and figures to be used for evaluating cross-normalization constants\nobtained from other observations with the above mentioned observatories.\n", "  In this paper we construct a new Type IIB background with an $AdS_4$ factor\nthat preserves ${\\cal N}=4$ Supersymmetry. This solution is obtained using a\nnon-Abelian T-duality transformation on the Type IIA reduction of the\n$AdS_4\\times S^7$ background. We interpret our configuration as a patch of a\nmore general background with localised sources, dual to the renormalisation\nfixed point of a $T_{\\rho}^{\\hat{\\rho}} (SU(N))$ quiver field theory. This\nrelates explicitly the $AdS_4$ geometry to a D3-D5-NS5 brane intersection,\nilluminating what seems to be a more general phenomenon, relating $AdS_{p+1}$\nbackgrounds generated by non-Abelian T-duality to Dp-D(p+2)-NS5 branes\nintersections.\n", "  In recent years, direct detection, indirect detection, and collider\nexperiments have placed increasingly stringent constraints on particle dark\nmatter, exploring much of the parameter space associated with the WIMP\nparadigm. In this paper, we focus on the subset of WIMP models in which the\ndark matter annihilates in the early universe through couplings to either the\nStandard Model $Z$ or the Standard Model Higgs boson. Considering fermionic,\nscalar, and vector dark matter candidates within a model-independent context,\nwe find that the overwhelming majority of these dark matter candidates are\nalready ruled out by existing experiments. In the case of $Z$ mediated dark\nmatter, the only scenarios that are not currently excluded are those in which\nthe dark matter is a fermion with an axial coupling and with a mass either\nwithin a few GeV of the $Z$ resonance ($m_{\\rm DM} \\simeq m_Z/2$) or greater\nthan 200 GeV, or with a vector coupling and with $m_{\\rm DM} > 6$ TeV. Several\nHiggs mediated scenarios are currently viable if the mass of the dark matter is\nnear the Higgs pole ($m_{\\rm DM} \\simeq m_H/2$). Otherwise, the only scenarios\nthat are not excluded are those in which the dark matter is a scalar (vector)\nheavier than 400 GeV (1160 GeV) with a Higgs portal coupling, or a fermion with\na pseudoscalar (CP violating) coupling to the Standard Model Higgs boson. With\nthe exception of dark matter with a purely pseudoscalar coupling to the Higgs,\nit is anticipated that planned direct detection experiments will probe nearly\nthe entire range of models considered in this study.\n", "  We analyze the physical properties and energy balance of density enhancements\nin two SPH simulations of the formation, evolution, and collapse of giant\nmolecular clouds. In the simulations, no feedback is included, so all motions\nare due either to the initial, decaying turbulence, or to gravitational\ncontraction. We define clumps as connected regions above a series of density\nthresholds. The resultingfull set of clumps follows the generalized\nenergy-equipartition relation $\\sigma_{v}/R^{1/2} \\propto \\Sigma^{1/2}$, where\n$\\sigma_{v}$ is the velocity dispersion, $R$ is the \"radius\", and $\\Sigma$ is\nthe column density. We interpret this as a natural consequence of gravitational\ncontraction at all scales, rather than virial equilibrium. Nevertheless, clumps\nwith low $\\Sigma$ tend to show a large scatter around equipartition. In more\nthan half of the cases, this scatter is dominated by external turbulent\ncompressions that {\\it assemble} the clumps, rather than by small-scale random\nmotions that would disperse them. The other half does actually disperse.\nMoreover, clump sub-samples selected by means of different criteria exhibit\ndifferent scalings. Sub-samples with narrow $\\Sigma$ ranges follow Larson-like\nrelations, although characterized by their respective value of $\\Sigma$.\nFinally, we find that: i) clumps lying in filaments tend to appear sub-virial;\nii) high-density cores ($n \\ge 10^5$ cm$^3$) that exhibit moderate kinetic\nenergy excesses often contain sink (\"stellar\") particles, and the excess\ndisappears when the stellar mass is taken into account in the energy balance;\niii) cores with kinetic energy excess but no stellar particles are truly in a\nstate of dispersal.\n", "  A stellar mass black hole (BH) surrounded by a neutrino-dominated accretion\nflow (NDAF) has been discussed in a number of works as the central engine of\ngamma-ray bursts (GRBs). It is widely believed that NDAF cannot liberate enough\nenergy for bright GRBs. However, these works have been based on the assumption\nof \"no torque\" boundary condition, which is invalid when the disk is\nmagnetized. In this paper, we present both numerical and analytical solutions\nfor NDAFs with non-zero boundary stresses, and reexamine their properties. We\nfind that NDAF with such boundary torque can be powerful enough to account for\nthose bright short GRBs, energetic long GRBs and ultra-long GRBs. The disk\nbecomes viscously unstable, which makes it possible to interpret the\nvariability of GRB prompt emission and the steep decay phase in the early X-ray\nafterglow. Finally, we study the gravitational waves radiated from a processing\nBH-NDAF. We find that the effects of the boundary torque on the strength of the\ngravitational waves can be ignored.\n", "  (Ga,In)As/GaAs/Ga(As,Sb) multi-quantum well heterostructures have been\ninvestigated using continuous wave and time-resolved photoluminescence\nspectroscopy at various temperatures. A complex interplay was observed between\nthe excitonic type-II transitions with electrons in the (Ga,In)As well and\nholes in the Ga(As,Sb) well and the type-I excitons in the (Ga,In)As and\nGa(As,Sb) wells. The type-II luminescence exhibits a strongly non-exponential\ntemporal behavior below a critical temperature of Tc = 70K. The transients were\nanalyzed in the framework of a rate-equation model. It was found that the\nexciton relaxation and hopping in the localized states of the disordered\nternary Ga(As,Sb) are the decisive processes to describe the dynamics of the\ntype-II excitons correctly.\n", "  We summarize recent progress in describing the confinement-deconfinement\ntransition from a novel perturbative approach.\n", "  A generalized teleparallel cosmological model, $f(T_\\mathcal{G},T)$,\ncontaining the torsion scalar $T$ and the teleparallel counterpart of the\nGauss-Bonnet topological invariant $T_{\\mathcal{G}}$, is studied in the\nframework of the Noether Symmetry Approach. As $f(\\mathcal{G}, R)$ gravity,\nwhere $\\mathcal{G}$ is the Gauss-Bonnet topological invariant and $R$ is the\nRicci curvature scalar, exhausts all the curvature information that one can\nconstruct from the Riemann tensor, in the same way, $f(T_\\mathcal{G},T)$\ncontains all the possible information directly related to the torsion tensor.\nIn this paper, we discuss how the Noether Symmetry Approach allows to fix the\nform of the function $f(T_\\mathcal{G},T)$ and to derive exact cosmological\nsolutions.\n", "  We present a new evaluation of the negatively charged pion mass based on the\nsimultaneous spec-troscopy of pionic nitrogen and muonic oxygen transitions\nusing a gaseous target composed by a N 2 /O 2 mixture at 1.4 bar. We present\nthe experimental setup and the methods for deriving the pion mass value from\nthe spatial separation from the 5g -- 4 f $\\pi$N transition line and the 5g --\n4 f $\\mu$O transition line used as reference. Moreover, we discuss the\nimportance to use dilute targets in order to minimize the influence of\nadditional spectral lines from the presence of remaining electrons during the\nradiative emission. The occurrence of possible satellite lines is investigated\nvia hypothesis testing methods using the Bayes factor.\n", "  We investigate high-order harmonic generation in a solid, modeled as a\nmulti-level system dressed by a strong infrared laser field. We show that the\ncutoff energies and the relative strengths of the multiple plateaus that emerge\nin the harmonic spectrum can be understood both qualitatively and\nquantitatively by considering a combination of adiabatic and diabatic processes\ndriven by the strong field. Such a model was recently used to interpret the\nmultiple plateaus exhibited in harmonic spectra generated by solid argon and\nkrypton [Ndabashimiye {\\it et al.}, Nature 534, 520 (2016)]. We also show that\nwhen the multi-level system originates from the Bloch state at the $\\Gamma$\npoint of the band structure, the laser-dressed states are equivalent to the\nHouston states [Krieger {\\it el al.} Phys. Rev. B 33, 5494 (1986)] and will\ntherefore map out the band structure away from the $\\Gamma$ point as the laser\nfield increases. This leads to a semi-classical three-step picture in momentum\nspace that describes the high-order harmonic generation process in a solid.\n", "  Long dynamical timescales in the outskirts of galaxies preserve the\ninformation content of their accretion histories, for example in the form of\nstellar population gradients. We present a detailed analysis of the stellar\nhalo properties of a statistically representative sample of early-type galaxies\nfrom the Illustris simulation and show that stellar population gradients at\nlarge radii can indeed be used to infer basic properties of galactic accretion\nhistories. We measure metallicity, age, and surface-brightness profiles in\nquiescent Illustris galaxies ranging from $\\mathrm{M}_\\star = 10^{10} - 2\\times\n10^{12}\\;\\mathrm{M}_\\odot$ and show that they are in reasonable agreement with\nobservations. At fixed mass, galaxies that accreted little of their stellar\nhalo material tend to have steeper metallicity and surface-brightness profiles\nbetween 2 - 4 effective radii (R$_e$) than those with larger accreted\nfractions. Profiles of metallicity and surface-brightness in the stellar halo\ntypically flatten from z = 1 to the present. This suggests that the accretion\nof stars into the stellar halo tends to flatten metallicity and\nsurface-brightness profiles, a picture which is supported by the tight\ncorrelation between the two gradients in the stellar halo. We find no\nstatistical evidence of additional information content related to accretion\nhistories in stellar halo metallicity profiles beyond what is contained in\nsurface-brightness profiles. Age gradients in the stellar halo do not appear to\nbe sensitive to galactic accretion histories, and none of the stellar\npopulation gradients studied are strongly correlated with the mean merger\nmass-ratio. Future observations that reach large radii outside galaxies will\nhave the best potential to constrain galactic accretion histories.\n", "  The formation of ice affects many aspects of our everyday life as well as\ntechnologies such as cryotherapy and cryopreservation. Foreign substances\nalmost always aid water freezing through heterogeneous ice nucleation, but the\nmolecular details of this process remain largely unknown. In fact, insight into\nthe microscopic mechanism of ice formation on different substrates is difficult\nto obtain even via state-of-the-art experimental techniques. At the same time,\natomistic simulations of heterogeneous ice nucleation frequently face\nextraordinary challenges due to the complexity of the water-substrate\ninteraction and the long timescales that characterize nucleation events. Here,\nwe have investigated several aspects of molecular dynamics simulations of\nheterogeneous ice nucleation considering as a prototypical ice nucleating\nmaterial the clay mineral kaolinite, which is of relevance in atmospheric\nscience. We show via seeded molecular dynamics simulations that ice nucleation\non the hydroxylated (001) face of kaolinite proceeds exclusively via the\nformation of the hexagonal ice polytype. The critical nucleus size is two times\nsmaller than that obtained for homogeneous nucleation at the same supercooling.\nPrevious findings suggested that the flexibility of the kaolinite surface can\nalter the time scale for ice nucleation within molecular dynamics simulations.\nHowever, we here demonstrate that equally flexible (or non flexible) kaolinite\nsurfaces can lead to very different outcomes in terms of ice formation,\naccording to whether or not the surface relaxation of the clay is taken into\naccount. We show that very small structural changes upon relaxation\ndramatically alter the ability of kaolinite to provide a template for the\nformation of a hexagonal overlayer of water molecules at the water-kaolinite\ninterface, and that this relaxation therefore determines the nucleation ability\nof this mineral.\n", "  Weyl consistency conditions are a powerful tool to study the irreversibility\nproperties of the renormalization group. We apply this formalism to\nnon-relativistic theories in 2 spatial dimensions with boost invariance and\ndynamical exponent z=2. Different possibilities are explored, depending on the\nstructure of the gravitational background used as a source for the\nenergy-momentum tensor.\n", "  In an uncoupled linear lattice system, the Kapchinskij-Vladimirskij (KV)\ndistribution, formulated on the basis of the single-particle Courant-Snyder\n(CS) invariants, has served as a fundamental theoretical basis for the analyses\nof the equilibrium, stability, and transport properties of high-intensity beams\nfor the past several decades. Recent applications of high-intensity beams,\nhowever, require beam phase-space manipulations by intentionally introducing\nstrong coupling. In this Letter, we report the full generalization of the KV\nmodel by including all of the linear (both external and space-charge) coupling\nforces, beam energy variations, and arbitrary emittance partition, which all\nform essential elements for phase-space manipulations. The new generalized KV\nmodel yields spatially uniform density profiles and corresponding linear\nself-field forces as desired. The corresponding matrix envelope equations and\nbeam matrix for the generalized KV model provide important new theoretical\ntools for the detailed design and analysis of high-intensity beam\nmanipulations, for which previous theoretical models are not easily applicable.\n", "  The background-oriented schlieren (BOS) technique with the physics-based\noptical flow method (OF-BOS) is developed for measuring the pressure field of a\nlaser-induced underwater shock wave. Compared to BOS with the conventional\ncross-correlation method in PIV (called PIV-BOS), by using the OF-BOS, the\ndisplacement field generated by the small density gradient in water can be\nobtained at the spatial resolution of one vector per pixel. The corresponding\ndensity and pressure fields can be further extracted. It is particularly\ndemonstrated that the sufficiently high spatial resolution of the extracted\ndisplacement vector field is required in the tomographic reconstruction to\ncorrectly infer the pressure field of the spherical underwater shock wave. The\ncapability of the OF-BOS is critically evaluated based on synchronized\nhydrophone measurements. Special emphasis is placed on direct comparison\nbetween the OF-BOS with the PIV-BOS.\n", "  In this note we present a new parametrization of the hadronic current for the\ndecay $\\tau \\to \\pi\\pi\\pi \\nu_\\tau$ derived from the chiral lagrangian with\nexplicit inclusion of resonances. We have included both scalar, vector and\naxial-vector resonances. For the first time, the lowest tensor resonance\n($f_2(1270)$) is included as well. Both single and double-resonance\ncontributions to the hadronic form factors are taken into account. To satisfy\nthe correct high energy behaviour of the hadronic form factors, constraints on\nnumerical values of the vertex constants are obtained.\n", "  Density functional theory (DFT) calculations are carried out to study the\nstructure and electronic structure of amorphous zinc oxide (a-ZnO). The models\nwere prepared by the \"melt-quench\" method. The models are chemically ordered\nwith some coordination defects. The effect of trivalent dopants in the\nstructure and electronic properties of a-ZnO is investigated. Models of\na-X_0.375 Z_0.625 O (X=Al, Ga and In) were also prepared by the \"melt- quench\"\nmethod. The trivalent dopants reduce the four-fold Zn and O, thereby\nintroducing some coordination defects in the network. The dopants prefer to\nbond with O atom. The network topology is discussed in detail. Dopants reduce\nthe gap in EDOS by producing defect states minimum while maintaining the\nextended nature of the conduction band edge.\n", "  Vibrations can cause noise in scanning probe microscopies. Relative\nvibrations between the scanning sensor and the sample are important but can be\nmore difficult to determine than absolute vibrations or vibrations relative to\nthe laboratory. We measure the noise spectral density in a scanning SQUID\nmicroscope as a function of position near a localized source of magnetic field,\nand show that we can determine the spectra of all three components of the\nrelative sensor-sample vibrations. This method is a powerful tool for\ndiagnosing vibrational noise in scanning microscopies.\n", "  The exchange interaction between two magnetic moments embedded in a host\nmetal is fundamental to the description of the magnetic behavior of solids. In\nthe standard spin-degenerate electron gas, it leads to the well known\nRuderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yoshida (RKKY) interaction, which is of the Heisenberg\nform $J\\vec S_1\\cdot \\vec S_2$, where the interaction strength $J$ oscillates\nand falls off with the distance between the moments in a characteristic way.\nHere, we study the more general case of the spin-polarized electron gas both in\ntwo and three dimensions, by evaluating the interaction strength as an\nintegration over the product of the host Green's functions. We find that in\naddition to the Heisenberg term, an additional Ising-like term appears in the\nmagnetic interaction, so that the net interaction for the spin-polarized gas is\nof the form $J_1 \\vec S_1\\cdot \\vec S_2 + J_2 S_{1z} S_{2z}$. The interactions\nshow a beating pattern as a function of distance, caused by the two different\nFermi momenta for the two spins.\n", "  This study aims to unravel the mechanism of colossal magnetoresistance (CMR)\nobserved in n-type HgCr$_2$Se$_4$, in which low-density conduction electrons\nare exchange-coupled to a three-dimensional Heisenberg ferromagnet with a Curie\ntemperature $T_C\\approx$ 105 K. Near room temperature the electron transport\nexhibits an ordinary semiconducting behavior. As temperature drops below\n$T^*\\simeq2.1T_C$, the magnetic susceptibility deviates from the Curie-Weiss\nlaw, and concomitantly the transport enters an intermediate regime exhibiting a\npronounced CMR effect before a transition to metallic conduction occurs at\n$T<T_C$. Our results suggest an important role of spin correlations not only\nnear the critical point, but also for a wide range of temperatures\n($T_C<T<T^*$) in the paramagnetic phase. In this intermediate temperature\nregime the transport undergoes a percolation type of transition from isolated\nmagnetic polarons to a continuous network when temperature is lowered or\nmagnetic field becomes stronger.\n", "  The dynamics of the large-scale structure of the universe enjoys at all\nscales, even in the highly non-linear regime, a Lifshitz symmetry during the\nmatter-dominated period. In this paper we propose a general class of\nsix-dimensional spacetimes which could be a gravity dual to the\nfour-dimensional large-scale structure of the universe. In this set-up, the\nLifshitz symmetry manifests itself as an isometry in the bulk and our universe\nis a four-dimensional brane moving in such six-dimensional bulk. After finding\nthe correspondence between the bulk and the brane dynamical Lifshitz exponents,\nwe find the intriguing result that the preferred value of the dynamical\nLifshitz exponent of our observed universe, at both linear and non-linear\nscales, corresponds to a fixed point of the RGE flow of the dynamical Lifshitz\nexponent in the dual system where the symmetry is enhanced to the Schrodinger\ngroup containing a non-relativistic conformal symmetry. We also investigate the\nRGE flow between fixed points of the Lifshitz dynamical exponent in the bulk\nand observe that this flow is reflected in a growth rate of the large-scale\nstructure, which seems to be in qualitative agreement with what is observed in\ncurrent data. Our set-up might provide an interesting new arena for testing the\nideas of holography and gravitational duals.\n", "  The number density of local maxima of weak lensing field, referred to as\nweak-lensing peak counts, can be used as a cosmological probe. However, its\nrelevant cosmological information is still unclear. We study the relationship\nbetween the peak counts and other statistics in weak lensing field by using\n1000 ray-tracing simulations. We construct a local transformation of lensing\nfield $\\cal K$ to a new Gaussian field $y$, named local-Gaussianized\ntransformation. We calibrate the transformation with numerical simulations so\nthat the one-point distribution and the power spectrum of $\\cal K$ can be\nreproduced from a single Gaussian field $y$ and monotonic relation between $y$\nand $\\cal K$. Therefore, the correct information of two-point clustering and\nany order of moments in weak lensing field should be preserved under\nlocal-Gaussianized transformation. We then examine if local-Gaussianized\ntransformation can predict weak-lensing peak counts in simulations. The\nlocal-Gaussianized transformation is insufficient to explain weak-lensing peak\ncounts in the absence of shape noise. The prediction by local-Gaussianized\ntransformation underestimates the simulated peak counts with a level of\n$\\sim20-30\\%$ over a wide range of peak heights. Local-Gaussianized\ntransformation can predict the weak-lensing peak counts with a $\\sim10\\%$\naccuracy in the presence of shape noise. Our analyses suggest that the\ncosmological information beyond power spectrum and its moments would be\nnecessary to predict the weak-lensing peak counts with a percent-level\naccuracy, which is an expected statistical uncertainty in upcoming wide-field\ngalaxy surveys.\n", "  Encke-type comet 332P/Ikeya-Murakami is experiencing cascading fragmentation\nevents during its 2016 apparition. It is likely the first splitting Encke-type\ncomet ever being observed. A nongravitational solution to the astrometry\nreveals a statistical detection of the radial and transverse nongravitational\nparameters, $A_{1} = \\left(1.54 \\pm 0.39\\right) \\times 10^{-8}$ AU day$^{-2}$,\nand $A_{2} = \\left(7.19 \\pm 1.92\\right) \\times 10^{-9}$ AU day$^{-2}$,\nrespectively, which implies a nucleus erosion rate of $\\left(0.91 \\pm\n0.17\\right)$% per orbital revolution. The mass-loss rate likely has to be\nsupported by a much larger fraction of an active surface area than known cases\nof short-period comets; it may be relevant to the ongoing fragmentation. We\nfailed to detect any serendipitous pre-discovery observations of the comet in\narchival data from major sky surveys, whereby we infer that 332P used to be\nlargely inactive, and is perhaps among the few short-period comets which have\nbeen reactivated from weakly active or dormant states. We therefore constrain\nan upper limit to the nucleus size as $2.0 \\pm 0.2$ km in radius. A search for\nsmall bodies in similar orbits to that of 332P reveals comet P/2010 B2 (WISE)\nas the best candidate. From an empirical generalised Jupiter-family (Encke-type\nincluded) comet population model, we estimate the likelihood of chance\nalignment of the 332P--P/2010 B2 pair to be 1 in 33, a small number indicative\nof a genetic linkage between the two comets on a statistical basis. The pair\npossibly originated from a common progenitor which underwent a disintegration\nevent well before the twentieth century.\n", "  Cyanopolyynes are chains of carbon atoms with an atom of hydrogen and a CN\ngroup on either side. They are detected almost everywhere in the ISM, as well\nas in comets. In the past, they have been used to constrain the age of some\nmolecular clouds, since their abundance is predicted to be a strong function of\ntime. We present an extensive study of the cyanopolyynes distribution in the\nsolar-type protostar IRAS16293-2422 based on TIMASSS IRAM-30m observations. The\ngoals are (i) to obtain a census of the cyanopolyynes in this source and of\ntheir isotopologues; (ii) to derive how their abundance varies across the\nprotostar envelope; and (iii) to obtain constraints on the history of\nIRAS16293-2422. We detect several lines from HC3N and HC5N, and report the\nfirst detection of DC3N, in a solar-type protostar. We found that the HC3N\nabundance is roughly constant (~1.3x10^(-11)) in the outer cold envelope of\nIRAS16293-2422, and it increases by about a factor 100 in the inner region\nwhere Tdust>80K. The HC5N has an abundance similar to HC3N in the outer\nenvelope and about a factor of ten lower in the inner region. The HC3N\nabundance derived in the inner region, and where the increase occurs, also\nprovide strong constraints on the time taken for the dust to warm up to 80K,\nwhich has to be shorter than ~10^3-10^4yr. Finally, the cyanoacetylene\ndeuteration is about 50\\% in the outer envelope and <5$\\% in the warm inner\nregion. The relatively low deuteration in the warm region suggests that we are\nwitnessing a fossil of the HC3N abundantly formed in the tenuous phase of the\npre-collapse and then frozen into the grain mantles at a later phase. The\naccurate analysis of the cyanopolyynes in IRAS16293-2422 unveils an important\npart of its past story. It tells us that IRAS16293-2422 underwent a relatively\nfast (<10^5yr) collapse and a very fast (<10^3-10^4yr) warming up of the cold\nmaterial to 80K.\n", "  We consider several aspects related to the form, derivation and applications\nof the Liouville equation (LE) for flavour evolution of neutrinos. To take into\naccount the quantum nature of neutrinos we derive the evolution equation for\nthe matrix of densities using wave packets instead of Wigner functions. The\nobtained equation differs from the standard LE by an additional term which is\nproportional to the difference of group velocities. We show that this term\ndescribes loss of the propagation coherence in the system. In absence of\ninelastic collisions, the LE can be reduced to a single derivative equation\nover a trajectory coordinate. Additional time and spacial dependence may steam\nfrom initial (production) conditions. The transition from single neutrino\nevolution to the evolution of a neutrino gas is considered.\n", "  We extend to a possibly infinite chain the conformally invariant mechanical\nsystem that was introduced earlier as a toy model for understanding the\ntopological Yang-Mills theory. It gives a topological quantum model that has\ninteresting and computable zero modes and topological invariants. It confirms\nthe recent conjecture by several authors that supersymmetric quantum mechanics\nmay provide useful tools for understanding robotic mechanical systems (Vitelli\net al.) and condensed matter properties (Kane et al.), where trajectories of\neffective models are allowed or not by the conservation of topological indices.\nThe absences of ground state and mass gaps are special features of such\nsystems.\n", "  Context. Clusters of galaxies are important for cosmology and astrophysics.\nThey may be discovered through either the summed optical/IR radiation\noriginating from their member galaxies or via X-ray emission originating from\nthe hot intracluster medium. X- ray samples are not affected by projection\neffects but a redshift determination typically needs optical and infrared\nfollow-up to then infer X-ray temperatures and luminosities. Aims. We want to\nconfirm serendipitously discovered X-ray emitting cluster candidates and\nmeasure their cosmological redshift through the analysis and exploration of\nmulti-wavelength photometric catalogues. Methods. We developed a tool, the\nIntegrated Cluster Finder (ICF), to search for clusters by determining\noverdensities of potential member galaxies in optical and infrared catalogues.\nBased on a spectroscopic meta-catalogue we calibrated colour-redshift relations\nthat combine optical (SDSS) and IR data (UKIDSS, WISE). The tool is used to\nquantify the overdensity of galaxies against the background via a modified\nredMaPPer technique and to quantify the confidence of a cluster detection.\nResults. Cluster finding results are compared to reference catalogues found in\nthe literature. The results agree to within 95-98%. The tool is used to confirm\n488 out of 830 cluster candidates drawn from 3XMMe in the footprint of the SDSS\nand CFHT catalogues. Conclusions. The ICF is a flexible and highly efficient\ntool to search for galaxy clusters in multiple catalogues and is freely\navailable to the community. It may be used to identify the cluster content in\nfuture X-ray catalogues from XMM-Newton and eventually from eROSITA.\n", "  The competition between superconductivity and other ground states of solids\nis one of the challenging topics in condensed matter physics. Apart from\nhigh-temperature superconductors [1,2] this interplay also plays a central role\nin the layered transition-metal dichalcogenides, where superconductivity is\nstabilized by suppressing charge-density-wave order to zero temperature by\nintercalation [3] or applied pressure [4-7]. 1T-TiSe$_2$ forms a prime example,\nfeaturing superconducting domes on intercalation as well as under applied\npressure. Here, we present high energy-resolution inelastic x-ray scattering\nmeasurements of the CDW soft phonon mode in intercalated Cu$_x$TiSe$_2$ and\npressurized 1T-TiSe$_2$ along with detailed ab-initio calculations for the\nlattice dynamical properties and phonon-mediated superconductivity. We find\nthat the intercalation-induced superconductivity can be explained by a solely\nphonon-mediated pairing mechanism, while this is not possible for the\nsuperconducting phase under pressure. We argue that a hybridization of phonon\nand exciton modes in the pairing mechanism is necessary to explain the full\nobserved temperature-pressure-intercalation phase diagram. These results\nindicate that 1T-TiSe$_2$ under pressure is close to the elusive state of the\nexcitonic insulator.\n", "  We discretize the Weyl equation for a massless, spin-1/2 particle on a\ntime-diagonal, hypercubic spacetime lattice with null faces. The amplitude for\na step of right-handed chirality is proportional to the spin projection\noperator in the step direction, while for left-handed it is the orthogonal\nprojector. Iteration yields a path integral for the retarded propagator, with\nmatrix path amplitude proportional to the product of projection operators. This\nassigns the amplitude $i^{\\pm T}\\, {3}^{-B/2}\\,2^{-N}$ to a path with $N$\nsteps, $B$ bends, and $T$ right-handed minus left-handed bends, where the sign\ncorresponds to the chirality. Fermion doubling does not occur in this discrete\nscheme. A Dirac mass $m$ introduces the amplitude $i\\epsilon m$ to flip\nchirality in any given time step $\\epsilon$, and a Majorana mass similarly\nintroduces a charge conjugation amplitude.\n", "  We present a comprehensive analysis of the structural properties and\nluminosities of the 23 dwarf spheroidal galaxies that fall within the footprint\nof the Pan-Andromeda Archaeological Survey (PAndAS). These dwarf galaxies\nrepresent the large majority of Andromeda's known satellite dwarf galaxies and\ncover a wide range in luminosity ($-11.6<M_V<-5.8$ or $10^{4.2}< L <10^{6.5}\nL_\\odot$) and surface brightness ($25.1<\\mu_0<29.3$ mag/arcsec$^2$). We confirm\nmost previous measurements, but find And XIX to be significantly larger than\nbefore ($r_h=3065^{+1065}_{-935}$ pc, $M_V=-10.1^{+0.8}_{-0.4}$) and cannot\nderive parameters for And XXVII as it is likely not a bound stellar system. We\nalso significantly revise downward the luminosities of And~XV and And~XVI,\nwhich are now $M_V\\sim-7.5$ or $L\\sim10^5 L_\\odot$. Finally, we provide the\nfirst detailed analysis of Cas II/And XXX, a fairly faint system\n($M_V=-8.0^{+0.4}_{-0.3}$) of typical size ($r_h=270\\pm50$ pc), located in\nclose proximity to the two bright elliptical dwarf galaxies NGC 147 & 185.\nCombined with the set of homogeneous distances published in an earlier\ncontribution, our analysis dutifully tracks all relevant sources of uncertainty\nin the determination of the properties of the dwarf galaxies from the PAndAS\nphotometric catalogue. We further publish the posterior probability\ndistribution functions of all the parameters we fit for in the form of MCMC\nchains available online; these inputs should be used in any analysis that aims\nto remain truthful to the data and properly account for covariance between\nparameters.\n", "  We study the semi-classical interpretation of the $x^3$ and $x^4$ moments of\ntwist-3 parton distribution functions (PDFs). While no semi-classical\ninterpretation for the higher moments of $g_T(x)$ and $e(x)$ was find, the\n$x^3$ moment of the chirally odd spin-dependent twist-3 PDF $h_L^3(x)$ can be\nrelated to the longitudinal gradient of the transverse force on transversely\npolarized quarks in longitudinally polarized nucleons in a DIS experiment. We\ndiscuss how this result relates to the torque acting on a quark in the same\nexperiment. This has further implications for comparisons between tha\nJaffe-Manohar and the Ji decompositions of the nucleon spin.\n", "  Observations from the Herschel Space Observatory have more than doubled the\nnumber of wide debris disks orbiting Sunlike stars to include over 30 systems\nwith R > 100 AU. Here we present new Herschel PACS and re-analyzed Spitzer MIPS\nphotometry of five Sunlike stars with wide debris disks, from Kuiper belt size\nto R > 150 AU. The disk surrounding HD 105211 is well resolved, with an angular\nextent of >14\" along the major axis, and the disks of HD 33636, HD 50554, and\nHD 52265 are extended beyond the PACS PSF size (50% of energy enclosed within\nradius 4.23\"). HD 105211 also has a 24-micron infrared excess that was\npreviously overlooked because of a poorly constrained photospheric model.\nArchival Spitzer IRS observations indicate that the disks have small grains of\nminimum radius ~3 microns, though the minimum grain gradius is larger than the\nradiation pressure blowout size in all systems. If modeled as\nsingle-temperature blackbodies, the disk temperatures would all be <60 K. Our\nradiative transfer models predict actual disk radii approximately twice the\nradius of model blackbody disks. We find that the Herschel photometry traces\ndust near the source population of planetesimals. The disk luminosities are in\nthe range 0.00002 <= L/L* <= 0.0002, consistent with collisions in icy\nplanetesimal belts stirred by Pluto-size dwarf planets.\n", "  Layered transition metal dichalcogenides are emerging as key materials in\nnanoelectronics and energy applications. Predictive models to understand their\ngrowth, thermomechanical properties and interactions with metals are needed in\norder to accelerate their incorporation into commercial products. Interatomic\npotentials enable large-scale atomistic simulations at the device level, beyond\nthe range of applications of first principle methods. We present a ReaxFF\nreactive force field to describe molybdenum ditelluride and its interactions\nwith copper. We optimized the force field parameters to describe the properties\nof layered MoTe2 in various phases, the intercalation of Cu atoms and clusters\nwithin its van der Waals gap, including a proper description of energetics,\ncharges and mechanical properties. The training set consists of an extensive\nset of first principle calculations computed from density functional theory. We\nuse the force field to study the adhesion of a single layer MoTe2 on a Cu(111)\nsurface and the results are in good agreement with density functional theory,\neven though such structures were not part of the training set. We characterized\nthe mobility of the Cu ions intercalated into MoTe2 under the presence of an\nexternal electric fields via molecular dynamics simulations. The results show a\nsignificant increase in drift velocity for electric fields of approximately 0.4\nV/A and that mobility increases with Cu ion concentration.\n", "  We present a theoretical study of the mixed-field-orientation of asymmetric\ntop molecules in tilted static electric field and non-resonant linearly\npolarized laser pulse by solving the time-dependent Schr\\\"odinger equation.\nWithin this framework, we compute the mixed-field orientation of a state\nselected molecular beam of benzonitrile (C$_7$H$_5$N) and compare with the\nexperimental observations [J. L. Hansen et al., Phys. Rev. A 83, 023406\n(2011)], and with our previous time-independent descriptions [J. J. Omiste et\nal., Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 13, 18815 (2011)]. For an excited rotational\nstate, we investigate the field-dressed dynamics for several field\nconfigurations as those used in the mixed-field experiments. The non-adiabatic\nphenomena and their consequences on the rotational dynamics are analyzed in\ndetail.\n", "  Time-correlated noise is a significant source of uncertainty when modeling\nexoplanet light-curve data. A correct assessment of correlated noise is\nfundamental to determine the true statistical significance of our findings.\nHere we review three of the most widely used correlated-noise estimators in the\nexoplanet field, the time-averaging, residual-permutation, and\nwavelet-likelihood methods. We argue that the residual-permutation method is\nunsound in estimating the uncertainty of parameter estimates. We thus recommend\nto refrain from this method altogether. We characterize the behavior of the\ntime averaging's rms-vs.-bin-size curves at bin sizes similar to the total\nobservation duration, which may lead to underestimated uncertainties. For the\nwavelet-likelihood method, we note errors in the published equations and\nprovide a list of corrections. We further assess the performance of these\ntechniques by injecting and retrieving eclipse signals into synthetic and real\nSpitzer light curves, analyzing the results in terms of the relative-accuracy\nand coverage-fraction statistics. Both the time-averaging and\nwavelet-likelihood methods significantly improve the estimate of the eclipse\ndepth over a white-noise analysis (a Markov-chain Monte Carlo exploration\nassuming uncorrelated noise). However, the corrections are not perfect, when\nretrieving the eclipse depth from Spitzer datasets, these methods covered the\ntrue (injected) depth within the 68\\% credible region in only $\\sim$45--65\\% of\nthe trials. Lastly, we present our open-source model-fitting tool, Multi-Core\nMarkov-Chain Monte Carlo ({MC$^3$}). This package uses Bayesian statistics to\nestimate the best-fitting values and the credible regions for the parameters\nfor a (user-provided) model. {MC$^3$} is a Python/C code, available at\nhttps://github.com/pcubillos/MCcubed.\n", "  Phase decomposition is a well-known process leading to the formation of\ntwo-phase mixtures. Here we show that a strain imposed on a ferroelastic\ncrystal promotes the formation of mixed phases and domains, i.e., domain and\nphase de-strain with local strains determined by a common tangent construction\non the free energy versus strain curves. It is demonstrated that a domain\nstructure can be understood using the concepts of domain/phase rule, lever\nrule, coherent and incoherent de-strain within the de-strain model description,\nin a complete analogy to phase decomposition. The proposed de-strain model is\nvalidated using phase-field simulations and experimental observations of\nPbTiO_3 and BiFeO_3 thin films as examples. The de-strain model provides a\nsimple tool to guide and design domain structures of ferroelastic systems.\n", "  We calculate divergent one-loop corrections to the propagators of the U(1)\ngauge theory on the truncated Heisenberg space, which is one of the extensions\nof the Grosse-Wulkenhaar model. The model is purely geometric, based on the\nYang-Mills action; the corresponding gauge-fixed theory is BRST invariant. We\nquantize perturbatively and, along with the usual wave-function and mass\nrenormalizations, we find divergent nonlocal terms of the $\\Box^{-1}$ and\n$\\Box^{-2}$ type. We discuss the meaning of these terms and possible\nimprovements of the model.\n", "  We evaluate the partition function of the free O(N) model on a two-parameter\nfamily of squashed three spheres. We also find new solutions of general\nrelativity with negative cosmological constant and the same double squashed\nboundary geometry and analyse their thermodynamic properties. Remarkably, both\nsystems exhibit a qualitatively similar behaviour over the entire configuration\nspace of boundary geometries. Recent formulations of dS/CFT enable one to\ninterpret the field theory partition function as a function of the two\nsquashing parameters as the Hartle-Hawking wave function in a minisuperspace\nmodel of anisotropic deformations of de Sitter space. The resulting probability\ndistribution is normalisable and globally peaked at the round three sphere,\nwith a low amplitude of boundary geometries with negative scalar curvature.\n", "  The computation of the correlation numbers in Minimal Liouville Gravity\ninvolves an integration over moduli spaces of complex curves. There are two\nindependent approaches to the calculation: the direct one, based on the CFT\nmethods and Liouville higher equations of motion, and the alternative one,\nmotivated by discrete description of 2D gravity and based on the Douglas string\nequation. However these two approaches give rise to the results that are not\nalways consistent among themselves. In this paper we explore this problem. We\nshow that in order to reconcile two methods the so-called discrete terms in the\noperator product expansion in the underlying Liouville theory must be properly\ntaken into account. In this way we propose modified version of the expression\nfor four-point correlation number and find full agreement between direct and\nalternative approaches. Our result allows to consider correlators without any\nrestrictions on the number of conformal blocks contributing to the matter\nsector correlation function.\n", "  Many collider observables suffer from non-global logarithms not captured by\nstandard resummation techniques. Classic examples are the light-jet mass event\nshape in the limit of small mass and the related hemisphere soft function. We\nderive factorization formulas for both of these and explicitly demonstrate that\nthey capture all logarithms present at NNLO. These formulas achieve full scale\nseparation and provide the basis for all-order resummations. A characteristic\nfeature of non-global observables is that the soft radiation is driven by\nmulti-Wilson-line operators, and the ones arising here map onto those relevant\nfor the case of narrow-cone jet cross sections. Numerically, the contributions\nof non-global logarithms to resummed hemisphere-mass event shapes are sizeable.\n", "  We present the unexpected discovery of four ultra diffuse galaxies (UDGs) in\na group environment. We recently identified seven extremely low surface\nbrightness galaxies in the vicinity of the spiral galaxy M101, using data from\nthe Dragonfly Telephoto Array. The galaxies have effective radii of $10\"-38\"$\nand central surface brightnesses of $25.6-27.7$ mag arcsec$^{-2}$ in g-band. We\nsubsequently obtained follow-up observations with $HST$ to constrain the\ndistances to these galaxies. Four remain persistently unresolved even with the\nspatial resolution of $HST$/ACS, which implies distances of $D > 17.5$ Mpc. We\nshow that the galaxies are most likely associated with a background group at\n$\\sim 27$ Mpc containing the massive ellipticals NGC 5485 and NGC 5473. At this\ndistance, the galaxies have sizes of $2.6-4.9$ kpc, and are classified as UDGs,\nsimilar to the populations that have been revealed in clusters such as Coma,\nVirgo and Fornax, yet even more diffuse. The discovery of four UDGs in a galaxy\ngroup demonstrates that the UDG phenomenon is not exclusive to cluster\nenvironments. Furthermore, their morphologies seem less regular than those of\nthe cluster populations, which may suggest a different formation mechanism or\nbe indicative of a threshold in surface density below which UDGs are unable to\nmaintain stability.\n", "  The cosmological process of hydrogen (HI) reionization in the intergalactic\nmedium is thought to be driven by UV photons emitted by star-forming galaxies\nand ionizing active galactic nuclei (AGN). The contribution of QSOs to HI\nreionization at $z>4$ has been traditionally believed to be quite modest.\nHowever, this view has been recently challenged by new estimates of a higher\nfaint-end UV luminosity function (LF). To set firmer constraints on the\nemissivity of AGN at $z<6$, we here make use of complete X-ray selected samples\nincluding deep Chandra and new COSMOS data, capable to efficiently measure the\n1 ryd comoving AGN emissivity up to $z\\sim5-6$ and down to five magnitudes\nfainter than probed by current optical surveys, without any luminosity\nextrapolation. We find good agreement between the logN$\\rm{_H}\\lesssim21-22$\ncm$^{-2}$ X-ray LF and the optically-selected QSO LF at all redshifts for\n$M_{1450}\\leq -23$. The full range of the logN$\\rm{_H}\\lesssim21-22$ cm$^{-2}$\nLF ($M_{1450} \\leq -17$) was then used to quantify the contribution of AGN to\nthe photon budget critical value needed to keep the Universe ionized. We find\nthat the contribution of ionizing AGN at $z = 6$ is as small as 1\\% - 7\\%, and\nvery unlikely to be greater than 30\\%, thus excluding an AGN-dominated\nreionization scenario.\n", "  We investigate the polarization properties of high harmonics generated with\nthe bichromatic counterrotating circularly polarized (BCCP) laser fields by\nnumerically solving time-dependent Schr\\\"odinger equation (TDSE). It is found\nthat, the helicity of the elliptically polarized harmonic emission is reversed\nat particular harmonic orders. Based on the time-frequency analysis and the\nclassical three-step model, the correspondence between the positions of\nhelicity reversions and the classical trajectories of continuum electrons is\nestablished. It is shown that, the electrons ionized at one lobe of laser field\ncan be divided into different groups based on the different lobes they\nrecombine at, and the harmonics generated by adjacent groups have opposite\nhelicities. Our study performs a detailed analysis of high harmonics in terms\nof electron trajectories and depicts a clear and intuitive physical picture of\nthe HHG process in BCCP laser field.\n", "  We add four warmer late-type supergiants to our previous\nspectro-interferometric studies of red giants and supergiants.\n  V766 Cen (=HR 5171 A) is found to be a high-luminosity log(L/L_sun)=5.8+-0.4\nsource of Teff 4290+-760 K and radius 1490+-540 Rsun located close to both the\nHayashi and Eddington limits; this source is consistent with a 40 Msun\nevolutionary track without rotation and current mass 27-36 Msun. It exhibits\nNaI in emission arising from a shell of radius 1.5 Rphot and a photocenter\ndisplacement of about 0.1 Rphot. V766 Cen shows strong extended molecular (CO)\nlayers and a dusty circumstellar background component. This suggest an\noptically thick pseudo-photosphere at about 1.5 Rphot at the onset of the wind.\nV766 Cen is a red supergiant located close to the Hayashi limit instead of a\nyellow hypergiant already evolving back toward warmer Teff as previously\ndiscussed.\n  The stars sigma Oph, BM Sco, and HD 206859 are found to have lower\nluminosities of about log(L/Lsun)=3.4-3.5 and Teff of 3900-5300 K,\ncorresponding to 5-9 Msun tracks. They do not show extended molecular layers as\nobserved for higher luminosity red supergiants of our sample. BM Sco shows an\nunusually strong contribution by an over-resolved circumstellar dust component.\nThese stars are more likely high-mass red giants instead of red supergiants.\n  This leaves us with an unsampled locus in the HR diagram corresponding to\nluminosities log(L/Lsun)~3.8-4.8 or masses 10-13 Msun, possibly corresponding\nto the mass region where stars explode as type II-P supernovae during the RSG\nstage.\n  Our previously found relation of increasing strength of extended molecular\nlayers with increasing luminosities is now confirmed to extend to double our\nprevious luminosities and up to the Eddington limit. This might further point\nto steadily increasing radiative winds with increasing luminosity.\n  [Abridged]\n", "  The photon detection efficiency of two sets of R10560-100-20 superbialkali\nphotomultiplier tubes from Hamamatsu were measured between 200 nm and 750 nm to\nquantify a possible degradation of the photocathode sensitivity after four\nyears of operation in the cameras of the VERITAS Cherenkov telescopes. A sample\nof 20 photomultiplier tubes, which was removed from the telescopes was compared\nwith a sample of 20 spare photomultiplier tubes, which had been kept in\nstorage. It is found that the average photocathode sensitivity marginally\nincreased below 300 nm and dropped by 10% to 30% above 500 nm. The average\nphotocathode sensitivity folded with the Cherenkov spectrum emitted by\nparticles in air showers, however, reveals a consistent detection yield of\n18.9+/-0.2% and 19.1+/-0.2% for the sample removed from the telescope and the\nspare sample, respectively.\n", "  The upcoming Mu3e experiment will search for the charged lepton flavour\nviolating decay of a muon at rest into three electrons. The maximal energy of\nthe electrons is 53 MeV, hence a low material budget is a key performance\nrequirement for the tracking detector. In this paper we summarize our approach\nto meet the requirement of about 0.1 % of a radiation length per pixel detector\nlayer. This includes the choice of thinned active monolithic pixel sensors in\nHV-CMOS technology, ultra-thin flexible printed circuits, and helium gas\ncooling.\n", "  The annihilation of TeV photons from extragalactic TeV sources and the\nextragalactic background light produces ultrarelativistic $e^{\\pm}$ beams,\nwhich are subject to powerful plasma instabilities that sap their kinetic\nenergy. Here we study the linear phase of the plasma instabilities that these\npair beams drive. To this end, we calculate the linear growth rate of the beam\nplasma and oblique instability in the electrostatic approximation in both the\nreactive and kinetic regimes, assuming a Maxwell-J{\\\"u}ttner distribution for\nthe pair beam. We reproduce the well-known reactive and kinetic growth rates\nfor both the beam plasma and oblique mode. We demonstrate for the oblique\ninstability that there is a broad spectrum of unstable modes that grow at the\nmaximum rate for a wide range of beam temperatures and wave vector orientations\nrelative to the beam. We also delineate the conditions for applicability for\nthe reactive and kinetic regimes and find that the beam plasma mode transitions\nto the reactive regime at a lower Lorentz factor than the oblique mode due to a\ncombination of their different scalings and the anisotropy of the velocity\ndispersions. Applying these results to the ultrarelativistic $e^{\\pm}$ beams\nfrom TeV blazars, we confirm that these beams are unstable to both, the kinetic\noblique mode and the reactive beam-plasma mode. These results are important in\nunderstanding how powerful plasma instabilities may sap the energy of the\nultrarelativistic $e^{\\pm}$ beams as they propagate through intergalactic\nspace.\n", "  In this work, we study the basic statistical properties of HI-selected\ngalaxies extracted from six different semi-analytic models, all run on the same\ncosmological N-body simulation. One model includes an explicit treatment for\nthe partition of cold gas into atomic and molecular hydrogen. All models\nconsidered agree nicely with the measured HI mass function in the local\nUniverse, with the measured scaling relations between HI and galaxy stellar\nmass, and with the predicted 2-point correlation function for HI rich galaxies.\nOne exception is given by one model that predicts very little HI associated\nwith galaxies in haloes above 10^12 Msun: we argue this is due to a too\nefficient radio-mode feedback for central galaxies, and to a combination of\nefficient stellar feedback and instantaneous stripping of hot gas for\nsatellites. We demonstrate that treatment of satellite galaxies introduces\nlarge uncertainties at low HI masses. While models assuming non instantaneous\nstripping of hot gas tend to form satellite galaxies with HI masses slightly\nsmaller than those of centrals with the same stellar mass, instantaneous gas\nstripping does not translate necessarily in lower HI masses. In fact, the\nadopted stellar feedback and star formation affect the satellites too. We\nanalyze the relation between HI content and spin of simulated haloes: low spin\nhaloes tend to host HI poor galaxies while high spin haloes are populated by\ngalaxies in a wide range of HI mass. In our simulations, this is due to a\ncorrelation between the initial gas disk size and the halo spin.\n", "  We study 1/2 BPS Wilson loops in 3d $\\mathcal{N}=4$ $U(N)$ Yang-Mills theory\nwith one adjoint and $N_f$ fundamental hypermultiplets from the Fermi gas\napproach. By numerical fitting, we find the first few worldsheet instanton\ncorrections to the Wilson loops with winding numbers 1, 2 and 3. We verify that\nour Fermi gas results are consistent with the matrix model results in the\nplanar limit.\n", "  We studied the extension of Standard Model (SM) Higgs sector with $SU(2)$\ntriplet and SM gauge singlet in the context of supersymmetry. For a $Z_3$\nsymmetric superpotential where the singlet field generates the bi-linear Higgs\nmixing term between two Higgs doublets dynamically. Models like this often have\na very light pseudoscalar as pseudo-Nambu Goldstone model of an extra $U(1)$\nsymmetry. We investigate the possibility of such light hidden Higgs boson with\nthe data of the discovered Higgs boson around 125 GeV. Along with the neutral\nsector, the charged Higgs bosons in the triplet extended case are really\ninteresting as the triplet charged Higgs bosons give rise to new decay mode to\n$Z W^\\pm$ along with $ a_1 W^\\pm$ due to the existence of light pseudoscalar.\nThese new modes can be looked for at the LHC in the search for the Higgs bosons\nin other representations of $SU(2)$.\n", "  The perturbative QCD expansion for $J/\\psi$ photoproduction appears to be\nunstable: the NLO correction is large (and of opposite sign) to the LO\ncontribution. Moreover, the predictions are very sensitive to the choice of\nfactorization and renormalization scales. Here we show that perturbative\nstability is greatly improved by imposing a $`Q_0$ cut' on the NLO coefficient\nfunctions; a cut which is required to avoid double counting. $Q_0$ is the input\nscale used in the parton DGLAP evolution. This result opens the possibility of\nhigh precision exclusive $J/\\psi$ data in the forward direction at the LHC\nbeing able to determine the low $x$ gluon distribution at low scales.\n", "  The Adaptive Aggregation-based Domain Decomposition Multigrid method\n(arXiv:1303.1377) is extended for two degenerate flavors of twisted mass\nfermions. By fine-tuning the parameters we achieve a speed-up of the order of\nhundred times compared to the conjugate gradient algorithm for the physical\nvalue of the pion mass. A thorough analysis of the aggregation parameters is\npresented, which provides a novel insight into multigrid methods for lattice\nQCD independently of the fermion discretization.\n", "  Slow swift electrons with low self-inertia interact differently with matter\nand light in comparison with their relativistic counterparts: they are easily\nrecoiled, reflected, and also diffracted form optical gratings and\nnanostructures. As a consequence, they can be also better manipulated into the\ndesired shape. For example, they get bunched quite fast in interaction with\nacceleration gratings in presence of an external electromagnetic radiation, a\nphenomenon which can be desirable in development of superradiant coherent light\nsources. Here, I examine the spatiotemporal behavior of pulsed electron wave\npackets at low energies interacting with pulsed light and optical gratings,\nusing a quantum-mechanical self-consistent numerical toolbox which is\nintroduced here. It will be shown that electron pulses are accelerated very\nfast in interaction with the near-field of the grating, demanding that a\nsynchronicity condition is met. To prevent the electrons to be transversely\ndeflected from the grating a symmetric double-grating configuration is\nnecessary. It is found that even in this configuration, diffraction due to the\ninteraction of the electron with the standing-wave light inside the gap between\nthe gratings, is a source of defocusing. Moreover, the longitudinal broadening\nof the electron pulse directly affects the final shape of the electron wave\npacket due to the occurrence of multiple electron-photon scatterings. These\ninvestigations pave the way towards the design of more efficient\nelectron-driven photon sources and accelerators.\n", "  We reconsider the observed CMB dipolar asymmetry in the context of open\ninflation, where a supercurvature mode might survive the bubble nucleation. If\nsuch a supercurvature mode modulates the amplitude of the curvature power\nspectrum, it would easily produce an asymmetry in the power spectrum. We show\nthat current observational data can be accommodated in a three-field model,\nwith simple quadratic potentials and a non-trivial field-space metric. Despite\nthe presence of three fields, we believe this model is so far the simplest that\ncan match current observations. We are able to match the observed strong scale\ndependence of the dipolar asymmetry, without a fine tuning of initial\nconditions, breaking slow roll or adding a feature to the evolution of any\nfield.\n", "  Novel bound states are obtained for manifolds with singular potentials. These\nsingular potentials require proper boundary conditions across boundaries. The\nnumber of bound states match nicely with what we would expect for black holes.\nAlso they serve to model membrane mechanism for the black hole horizons in\nsimpler contexts. The singular potentials can also mimic expanding boundaries\nelegantly, there by obtaining appropriately tuned radiation rates.\n", "  With a scheduled launch in October 2018, the James Webb Space Telescope\n(JWST) is expected to revolutionise the field of atmospheric characterization\nof exoplanets. The broad wavelength coverage and high sensitivity of its\ninstruments will allow us to extract far more information from exoplanet\nspectra than what has been possible with current observations. In this paper,\nwe investigate whether current retrieval methods will still be valid in the era\nof JWST, exploring common approximations used when retrieving transmission\nspectra of hot Jupiters. To assess biases, we use 1D photochemical models to\nsimulate typical hot Jupiter cloud-free atmospheres and generate synthetic\nobservations for a range of carbon-to-oxygen ratios. Then, we retrieve these\nspectra using TauREx, a Bayesian retrieval tool, using two methodologies: one\nassuming an isothermal atmosphere, and one assuming a parametrized temperature\nprofile. Both methods assume constant-with-altitude abundances. We found that\nthe isothermal approximation biases the retrieved parameters considerably,\noverestimating the abundances by about one order of magnitude. The retrieved\nabundances using the parametrized profile are usually within one sigma of the\ntrue state, and we found the retrieved uncertainties to be generally larger\ncompared to the isothermal approximation. Interestingly, we found that using\nthe parametrized temperature profile we could place tight constraints on the\ntemperature structure. This opens the possibility to characterize the\ntemperature profile of the terminator region of hot Jupiters. Lastly, we found\nthat assuming a constant-with-altitude mixing ratio profile is a good\napproximation for most of the atmospheres under study.\n", "  We present the results of a series of short radio observations of six\nultracool dwarfs made using the upgraded VLA in S (2--4GHz) and C (4--7GHz)\nbands. LSR J1835+3259 exhibits a 100 percent right-hand circularly polarised\nburst which shows intense narrowband features with a fast negative frequency\ndrift of about $-30$ MHz $\\textrm{s}^{-1}$. They are superimposed on a fainter\nbroadband emission feature with a total duration of about 20 minutes, bandwidth\nof about 1 GHz, centred at about 3.5 GHz, and a slow positive frequency drift\nof about 1 MHz $\\textrm{s}^{-1}$. This makes it the first such event detected\nbelow 4 GHz and the first one exhibiting both positive and negative frequency\ndrifts. Polarised radio emission is also seen in 2MASS J00361617+1821104 and\nNLTT 33370, while LP 349-25 and TVLM 513-46546 have unpolarised emission and\nBRI B0021-0214 was not detected. We can reproduce the main characteristics of\nthe burst from LSR J1835+3259 using a model describing the magnetic field of\nthe dwarf as a tilted dipole. We also analyse the origins of the quiescent\nradio emission and estimate the required parameters of the magnetic field and\nenergetic electrons. Although our results are non-unique, we find a set of\nmodels which agree well with the observations.\n", "  We elaborate upon the model of baryogenesis from decaying magnetic helicity\nby focusing on the evolution of the baryon number and magnetic field through\nthe Standard Model electroweak crossover. The baryon asymmetry is determined by\na competition between the helical hypermagnetic field, which sources baryon\nnumber, and the electroweak sphaleron, which tends to wash out baryon number.\nAt the electroweak crossover both of these processes become inactive; the\nhypermagnetic field is converted into an electromagnetic field, which does not\nsource baryon number, and the weak gauge boson masses grow, suppressing the\nelectroweak sphaleron reaction. An accurate prediction of the relic baryon\nasymmetry requires a careful treatment of the crossover. We extend our previous\nstudy [K. Kamada and A. J. Long, Phys. Rev. D94, 065301 (2016),\narXiv:1606.08891[astro-ph.CO]], taking into account the gradual conversion of\nthe hypermagnetic into the electromagnetic field. If the conversion is not\ncompleted by the time of sphaleron freeze-out, as both analytic and numerical\nstudies suggest, the relic baryon asymmetry is enhanced compared to previous\ncalculations. The observed baryon asymmetry of the Universe can be obtained for\na primordial magnetic field that has a present-day field strength and coherence\nlength of $B_0 \\sim 10^{-17} \\, {\\rm G}$ and $\\lambda_0 \\sim 10^{-3} \\, {\\rm\npc}$ and a positive helicity. For larger $B_0$ the baryon asymmetry is\noverproduced, which may be in conflict with blazar observations that provide\nevidence for an intergalactic magnetic field of strength $B_0 \\gtrsim\n10^{-14\\sim16} \\, {\\rm G}$.\n", "  In single-metric approximations to the exact renormalization group (RG) for\nquantum gravity, it has been not been clear how to treat the large curvature\ndomain beyond the point where the effective cutoff scale $k$ is less than the\nlowest eigenvalue of the appropriate modified Laplacian. We explain why this\npuzzle arises from background dependence, resulting in Wilsonian RG concepts\nbeing inapplicable. We show that when properly formulated over an ensemble of\nbackgrounds, the Wilsonian RG can be restored. This in turn implies that\nsolutions should be smooth and well defined no matter how large the curvature\nis taken. Even for the standard single-metric type approximation schemes, this\nconstruction can be rigorously derived by imposing a modified Ward identity\n(mWI) corresponding to rescaling the background metric by a constant factor.\nHowever compatibility in this approximation requires the space-time dimension\nto be six. Solving the mWI and flow equation simultaneously, new variables are\nthen derived that are independent of overall background scale.\n", "  In this work, the classical and the quantum capacitances are calculated for a\nFabry-P\\'{e}rot interferometer operating in the integer quantized Hall regime.\nWe first consider a rotationally symmetric electrostatic confinement potential\nand obtain the widths and the spatial distribution of the insulating\n(incompressible) circular strips using a charge density profile stemming from\nself-consistent calculations. Modelling the electrical circuit of capacitors\ncomposed of metallic gates and incompressible/compressible strips, we\ninvestigate the conditions to observe Aharonov-Bohm (quantum mechanical phase\ndependent) and Coulomb Blockade (capacitive coupling dependent) effects\nreflected in conductance oscillations. In a last step, we solve the\nSchr\\\"odinger and the Poisson equations self-consistently in a numerical manner\ntaking into account realistic experimental geometries. We find that, describing\nthe conductance oscillations either by Aharanov-Bohm or Coulomb Blockade\nstrongly depends on sample properties also other than size, therefore,\ndetermining the origin of these oscillations requires further experimental and\ntheoretical investigation.\n", "  We introduce the 5-dimension dynamical holographic QCD model, which is\nconstructed in the graviton-dilaton-scalar framework with the dilaton\nbackground field $\\Phi$ and the scalar field $X$ responsible for the\ngluodynamics and chiral dynamics, respectively. We review our results on the\nhadron spectra including the glueball and light meson spectra, QCD phase\ntransitions and transport properties in the framework of the dynamical\nholographic QCD model.\n", "  Mitigation of runaway electrons is one of the outstanding issues for the\nreliable operation of ITER and other large tokamaks, and accurate estimates for\nthe expected runaway-electron energies and current are needed. Previously,\nlinearized tools (which assume the runaway population to be small) have been\nused to study the runaway dynamics, but these tools are not valid in the cases\nof most interest, i.e. when the runaway population becomes substantial. We\nstudy runaway-electron formation in a post-disruption ITER plasma using the\nnewly developed non-linear code NORSE, and describe a feedback mechanism by\nwhich a transition to electron slide-away can be induced at field strengths\nsignificantly lower than previously expected. If the electric field is actively\nimposed using the control system, the entire electron population is quickly\nconverted to runaways in the scenario considered. We find the time until the\nfeedback mechanism sets in to be highly dependent on the details of the\nmechanisms removing heat from the thermal electron population.\n", "  While standing fast sausage modes in flare loops are often invoked to\ninterpret quasi-periodic pulsations (QPPs) in solar flares, it is unclear as to\nhow they are influenced by the combined effects of a continuous transverse\nstructuring and a finite internal plasma beta ($\\beta_{\\rm i}$). We derive a\ngeneric dispersion relation (DR) governing linear sausage waves in straight\nmagnetic tubes for which plasma pressure is not negligible and the density and\ntemperature inhomogeneities of essentially arbitrary form take place in a layer\nof arbitrary width. Focusing on fast modes, we find that $\\beta_{\\rm i}$ only\nweakly influences $k_{\\rm c}$, the critical longitudinal wavenumber separating\nthe leaky from trapped modes. Likewise, for both trapped and leaky modes, the\nperiods $P$ in units of the transverse fast time depend only weakly on\n$\\beta_{\\rm i}$, which is compatible with the fact that the effective\nwavevectors of fast sausage modes are largely perpendicular to the background\nmagnetic field. However, a weak $\\beta_{\\rm i}$ dependence of the damping times\n$\\tau$ is seen only when the length-to-radius ratio $L/R$ is $\\sim 50\\%$ larger\nthan some critical value $\\pi/(k_{\\rm c} R)$, which itself rather sensitively\ndepends on the density contrast, profile steepness as well as on how the\ntransverse structuring is described. In the context of QPPs, we conclude that\nthe much simpler zero-beta theory can be employed for trapped modes, as long as\none sees the deduced internal Alfv\\'en speed as actually being the fast speed.\nIn contrast, effects due to a finite beta in flare loops should be considered\nwhen leaky modes are exploited.\n"]}
