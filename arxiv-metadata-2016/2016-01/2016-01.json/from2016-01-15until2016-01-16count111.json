To that\nend, we start from the Clifford-Weyl algebera in its canonical realization on\nthe complex of holomorphic differential forms for a C-vector space V. From it\nwe construct the Fock representation of an orthosymplectic Lie superalgebra osp\nassociated to V. Particular attention is paid to defining Howe's oscillator\nsemigroup and the representation that partially exponentiates the Lie algebra\nrepresentation of sp in osp. In the process, by pushing the semigroup\nrepresentation to its boundary and arguing by continuity, we provide a\nconstruction of the Shale-Weil-Segal representation of the metaplectic group.\n  To deal with a product of n ratios of characteristic polynomials, we let V =\nC^n \\otimes C^N where C^N is equipped with its standard K-representation, and\nfocus on the subspace of K-equivariant forms. By Howe duality, this is a\nhighest-weight irreducible representation of the centralizer g of Lie(K) in\nosp. We identify the K-Haar expectation of n ratios with the character of this\ng-representation, which we show to be uniquely determined by analyticity, Weyl\ngroup invariance, certain weight constraints and a system of differential\nequations coming from the Laplace-Casimir invariants of g. We find an explicit\nsolution to the problem posed by all these conditions. In this way we prove\nthat the said Haar expectations are expressed by a Weyl-type character formula\nfor all integers N \\ge 1. This completes earlier work by Conrey, Farmer, and\nZirnbauer for the case of U(N).\n", "  It is shown that, when the inflaton field modulates the gauge kinetic\nfunction of the gauge fields in supergravity realisations of inflation, the\ndynamic backreaction leads to a new inflationary attractor solution, in which\nthe inflaton's variation suffers additional impedance. As a result, slow-roll\ninflation can naturally occur along directions of the scalar potential which\nwould be too steep and curved to support it otherwise. This provides a generic\nsolution to the infamous eta-problem of inflation in supergravity. Moreover, it\nis shown that, in the new inflationary attractor, the spectral index of the\ngenerated curvature perturbations is kept mildly red despite eta of order\nunity. The above findings are applied to a model of hybrid inflation is\nsupergravity with a generic Kaehler potential. The spectral index of the\ngenerated curvature perturbations is found to be 0.97 - 0.98, in excellent\nagreement with observations. The gauge field can play the role of the vector\ncurvaton after inflation but observable statistical anisotropy requires\nsubstantial tuning of the gauge coupling.\n", "  We study analytically the evolution of superconductivity in clean\nquasi-two-dimensional multiband supercon- ductors as the film thickness enters\nthe nanoscale region by mean-field and semiclassical techniques. Tunneling into\nthe substrate and finite lateral size effects, which are important in\nexperiments, are also considered in our model. As a result, it is possible to\ninvestigate the interplay between quantum coherence effects, such as shape\nresonances and shell effects, with the potential to enhance superconductivity,\nand the multiband structure and the coupling to the substrate that tend to\nsuppress it. The case of magnesium diboride, which is the conventional\nsuperconductor with the highest critical temperature, is discussed in detail.\nOnce the effect of the substrate is considered, we still observe quantum size\neffects such as the oscillation of the critical temperature with the thickness\nbut without a significant enhancement of superconductivity. In thin films with\na sufficiently longer superconducting coherence length, it is, however,\npossible to increase the critical temperature above the bulk limit by tuning\nthe film thickness or lateral size.\n", "  Recent experimental advances in surface science have made it possible to\ntrack the evolution of superconductivity in films as the thickness enters the\nnanoscale region where it is expected that the substrate plays an important\nrole. Here, we put forward a mean-field, analytically tractable, model that\ndescribes size effects in ultrathin films coupled to the substrate. We restrict\nour study to one-band, crystalline, weakly coupled superconductors with no\nimpurities. The thin-film substrate/vacuum interfaces are described by a simple\nasymmetric potential well and a finite quasiparticle lifetime. Boundary\nconditions are chosen to comply with the charge neutrality condition. This\nmodel provides a fair description of experimental results in ultrathin lead\nfilms: on average, the superconducting gap decreases with thickness and it is\nalways below the bulk value. Clear oscillations, remnants of the shape\nresonances, are still observed for intermediate thicknesses. For materials with\na weaker electron-phonon coupling and negligible disorder, a modest enhancement\nof superconductivity seems to be feasible. The relaxation of the charge\nneutrality condition, which is in principle justified in complex oxide\nheterostructures and other materials, would lead to a much stronger enhancement\nof superconductivity by size effects.\n", "  The purpose of this study is to measure the internal radiation dose using a\nhuman blood sample. In the literature, there is no process that allows the\ndirect measurement of the internal radiation dose received by a person. The\nluminescence counts from a blood sample having a laboratory-injected radiation\ndose and the waste blood of the patient injected with a radiopharmaceutical for\ndiagnostic purposes were both measured. The decay and dose-response curves were\nplotted for the different doses. The doses received by the different blood\naliquots can be determined by interpolating the luminescence counts to the\ndose-response curve. This study shows that the dose received by a person can be\nmeasured directly, simply and retrospectively by using only a very small amount\nof blood sample. The results will have important ramifications for the medicine\nand healthcare fields in particular. This will also be very important in cases\nof suspicion of radiation poisoning, malpractice and so on.\n", "  In this study it was shown that it is possible to determine radiation doses\nfrom external beam therapy both directly and retrospectively from a human blood\nsample. To the best of our knowledge no other studies exist on the direct\nmeasurement of doses received by a person from external beam therapy. Optically\nstimulated luminescence counts from a healthy blood sample exposed to an\nexternal radiation source were measured. Blood aliquots were given 0, 1, 2, 3,\n4, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 50, 100 and 200Gy beta doses and their decay and\ndose-response curves were plotted. While the luminescence intensities were\nfound to be relatively low for the doses smaller than 10Gy, they were measured\nconsiderably higher for doses greater than 10Gy. The dose received by the blood\naliquots was determined by interpolating the luminescence counts of 10Gy to the\ndose-response curve. This study has important ramifications for healthcare,\nmedicine and radiation protection\n", "  The quantization problem for the trace-bracket algebra, derived from double\nPoisson brackets, is discussed. We obtain a generalization of the boundary YBE\n(or so-called ABCD-algebra) for the quantization of quadratic trace-brackets. A\ndynamical deformation is proposed on the lines of Gervais-Neveu-Felder\ndynamical quantum algebras.\n", "  In this paper we investigate the Klein-Gordon equation in the past causal\ndomain of a De Sitter brane imbedded in a Anti-de Sitter bulk. We solve the\nglobal mixed hyperbolic problem. We prove that any finite energy solution can\nbe expressed as a Kaluza-Klein tower that is a superposition of free fields in\nthe Steady State Universe, of which we study the asymptotic behaviours. We show\nthat the leading term of a gravitational fluctuation is a massless graviton,\ni.e. the De Sitter brane is linearly stable.\n", "  We provide a new lower bound on the minimum distance of a family of quantum\nLDPC codes based on Cayley graphs proposed by MacKay, Mitchison and\nShokrollahi. Our bound is exponential, improving on the quadratic bound of\nCouvreur, Delfosse and Z\\'emor. This result is obtained by examining a family\nof subsets of the hypercube which locally satisfy some parity conditions.\n", "  We investigate the distribution of bipartite and multipartite entanglement in\nmultiqubit states. In particular we define a set of monogamy inequalities\nsharpening the conventional Coffman-Kundu-Wootters constraints, and we provide\nanalytical proofs of their validity for relevant classes of states. We present\nextensive numerical evidence validating the conjectured strong monogamy\ninequalities for arbitrary pure states of four qubits.\n", "  Recent high resolution AIA/SDO images show evidence of the development of the\nKelvin-Helmholtz instability, as coronal mass ejections (CMEs) expand in the\nambient corona. A large-scale magnetic field mostly tangential to the interface\nis inferred, both on the CME and on the background sides. However, the magnetic\nfield component along the shear flow is not strong enough to quench the\ninstability. There is also observational evidence that the ambient corona is in\na turbulent regime, and therefore the criteria for the development of the\ninstability are a-priori expected to differ from the laminar case. To study the\nevolution of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability with a turbulent background, we\nperform three-dimensional simulations of the incompressible magnetohydrodynamic\nequations. The instability is driven by a velocity profile tangential to the\nCME-corona interface, which we simulate through a hyperbolic tangent profile.\nThe turbulent background is generated by the application of a stationary\nstirring force. We compute the instability growth-rate for different values of\nthe turbulence intensity, and find that the role of turbulence is to attenuate\nthe growth. The fact that the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability is observed, sets an\nupper limit to the correlation length of the coronal background turbulence.\n", "  We study SYZ mirror symmetry in the context of non-Kaehler Calabi-Yau\nmanifolds. In particular, we study the six-dimensional Type II supersymmetric\n$SU(3)$ systems with Ramond-Ramond fluxes, and generalize them to higher\ndimensions. We show that Fourier-Mukai transform provides the mirror map\nbetween these Type IIA and Type IIB supersymmetric systems in the semi-flat\nsetting. This is concretely exhibited by nilmanifolds.\n", "  In this letter we show that magnetic fields generated at the electroweak\nphase transition are most likely too weak to explain the void magnetic fields\napparently observed today unless they have considerable helicity. We show that,\nin the simplest estimates, the helicity naturally produced in conjunction with\nthe baryon asymmetry is too small to explain observations, which require a\nhelicity fraction at least of order $10^{-14}-10^{-10}$ depending on the void\nfields constraint used. Therefore new mechanisms to generate primordial\nhelicity are required if magnetic fields generated during the electroweak phase\ntransition should explain the extragalactic fields.\n", "  We define the notion of a formal connection for a smooth family of star\nproducts with fixed underlying symplectic structure. Such a formal connection\nallows one to relate star products at different points in the family. This\ngeneralizes the formal Hitchin connection introduced by the first author. We\nestablish a necessary and sufficient condition that guarantees the existence of\na formal connection, and we describe the space of formal connections for a\nfamily as an affine space modelled by the derivations of the star products.\nMoreover we show that if the parameter space has trivial first cohomology group\nany two flat formal connections are related by an automorphism of the family of\nstar products.\n", "  We study the dynamics of non-aligning, non-interacting self-propelled\nparticles confined to a box in two dimensions. In the strong confinement limit,\nwhen the persistence length of the active particles is much larger than the\nsize of the box, particles stay on the boundary and align with the local\nboundary normal. It is then possible to derive the steady-state density on the\nboundary for arbitrary box shapes. In non-convex boxes, the non-uniqueness of\nthe boundary normal results in hysteretic dynamics and the density is\nnon-local, i.e. it depends on the global geometry of the box. These findings\nestablish a general connection between the geometry of a confining box and the\nbehavior of an ideal active gas it confines, thus providing a powerful tool to\nunderstand and design such confinements.\n", "  Using the non-equilibrium Keldysh formalism, we solve the equations of motion\nfor electron-phonon superconductivity, including an ultrafast pump field. We\npresent results for time-dependent photoemission spectra out of equilibrium\nwhich probes the dynamics of the superconducting gap edge. The partial melting\nof the order by the pump field leads to oscillations at twice the melted gap\nfrequency, a hallmark of the Higgs or amplitude mode. Thus the Higgs mode can\nbe directly excited through the nonlinear effects of an electromagnetic field\nand detected without any additional symmetry breaking.\n", "  The general structure of the spherically symmetric solutions in the Weyl\nconformal gravity is described. The corresponding Bach equations are derived\nfor the special type of metrics, which can be considered as the representative\nof the general class. The complete set of the pure vacuum solutions is found.\nIt consists of two classes. The first one contains the solutions with constant\ntwo-dimensional curvature scalar of our specific metrics, and the\nrepresentatives are the famous Robertson--Walker metrics. One of them we called\nthe \"gravitational bubbles\", which is compact and with zero Weyl tensor. Thus,\nwe obtained the pure vacuum curved space-times (without any material sources,\nincluding the cosmological constant) what is absolutely impossible in General\nRelativity. Such a phenomenon makes it easier to create the universe from\n\"nothing\". The second class consists of the solutions with varying curvature\nscalar. We found its representative as the one-parameter family. It appears\nthat it can be conformally covered by the thee-parameter Mannheim--Kazanas\nsolution. We also investigated the general structure of the energy-momentum\ntensor in the spherical conformal gravity and constructed the vectorial\nequation that reveals clearly some features of non-vacuum solutions. Two of\nthem are explicitly written, namely, the metrics \\`a la Vaidya, and the\nelectrovacuum space-time metrics.\n", "  We investigate the magnetic properties of spin-$1/2$ charged Fermi gases with\nferromagnetic coupling via mean-field theory, and find the interplay among the\nparamagnetism, diamagnetism and ferromagnetism. Paramagnetism and diamagnetism\ncompete with each other. When increasing the ferromagnetic coupling the\nspontaneous magnetization occurs in a weak magnetic field. The critical\nferromagnetic coupling constant of the paramagnetic phase to ferromagnetic\nphase transition increases linearly with the temperature. Both the\nparamagnetism and diamagnetism increase when the magnetic field increases. It\nreveals the magnetization density $\\bar M$ increases firstly as the temperature\nincreases, and then reaches a maximum. Finally the magnetization density $\\bar\nM$ decreases smoothly in the high temperature region. The domed shape of the\nmagnetization density $\\bar M$ variation is different from the behavior of Bose\ngas with ferromagnetic coupling. We also find the curve of susceptibility\nfollows the Curie-Weiss law, and for a given temperature the susceptibility is\ndirectly proportional to the Land\\'{e} factor.\n", "  We consider stochastic rotational dynamics of a macrospin at a constant\ntemperature, in presence of an external magnetic field. Starting from the\nappropriate Langevin equation which contains multiplicative noise, we calculate\nentropy production (EP) along stochastic trajectories, and obtain fluctuation\ntheorems. The system remains inherently out of equilibrium due to a spin torque\nsupporting azimuthal current, leading to an excess EP apart from the EP due to\nheat dissipation. The anomaly may be removed using a redefinition of dissipated\nheat and stochastic work done. Using numerical simulations, we obtain\ndistribution functions for entropy production along stochastic trajectories to\nfind good agreement with the detailed fluctuation theorem.\n", "  We study the twist-3 fragmentation functions $H$ and $\\tilde{H}$, by applying\na spectator model. In the calculation we consider the effect of the gluon\nrescattering at one loop level. We find that in this case the hard-vertex\ndiagram, which gives zero contribution to the Collins function, does contribute\nto the fragmentation function $H$. The calculation shows that the twist-3 T-odd\nfragmentation functions are free of light-cone divergences. The parameters of\nthe model are fitted from the known parametrization of the unpolarized\nfragmentation $D_1$ and the Collins function $H_1^\\perp$. We find our result\nfor the favored fragmentation function is consistent with the recent extraction\non $H$ and $\\tilde{H}$ from pp data. We also check numerically the equation of\nmotion relation for $H$, $\\tilde{H}$ and find that relation holds fairly well\nin the spectator model.\n", "  Optical clocks based on ensembles of trapped ions offer the perspective of\nrecord frequency uncertainty with good short-term stability. Most suitable\natomic species lack closed transitions for fast detection such that the clock\nsignal has to be read out indirectly through transferring the quantum state of\nclock ions to co-trapped logic ions by means of quantum logic operations. For\nensembles of clock ions existing methods for quantum logic readout require a\nlinear overhead in either time or the number of logic ions. Here we report a\nquantum algorithmic readout whose overhead scales logarithmically with the\nnumber of clock ions in both of these respects. We show that the readout\nalgorithm can be implemented with a single application of a multi-species\nquantum gate, which we describe in detail for a crystal of Aluminum and Calcium\nions.\n", "  We study random Hamiltonians on finite-size cubes and waveguide segments of\nincreasing diameter. The number of random parameters determining the operator\nis proportional to the volume of the cube. In the asymptotic regime where the\ncube size, and consequently the number of parameters as well, tends to\ninfinity, we derive deterministic and probabilistic variational bounds on the\nlowest eigenvalue, i.e. the spectral minimum, as well as exponential\noff-diagonal decay of the Green function at energies above, but close to the\noverall spectral bottom.\n", "  The recently discovered three-dimensional hyperhoneycomb iridate,\n$\\beta$-Li$_2$IrO$_3$, has raised hopes for the realization of dominant Kitaev\ninteraction between spin-orbit entangled local moments due to its near-ideal\nlattice structure. If true, this material may lie close to the sought-after\nquantum spin liquid phase in three dimensions. Utilizing ab-initio electronic\nstructure calculations, we first show that the spin-orbit entangled basis,\n$j_{\\rm eff}$=1/2, correctly captures the low energy electronic structure. The\neffective spin model derived in the strong coupling limit supplemented by the\nab-initio results is shown to be dominated by the Kitaev interaction. We\ndemonstrated that the possible range of parameters is consistent with a\nnon-coplanar spiral magnetic order found in a recent experiment. All of these\nanalyses suggest that $\\beta$-Li$_2$IrO$_3$ may be the closest among known\nmaterials to the Kitaev spin liquid regime.\n", "  Within the framework of shallow-water magnetohydrodynamics, we investigate\nthe linear instability of horizontal shear flows, influenced by an aligned\nmagnetic field and stratification. Various classical instability results, such\nas H{\\o}iland's growth rate bound and Howard's semi-circle theorem, are\nextended to this shallow-water system for quite general profiles. Two specific\npiecewise-constant velocity profiles, the vortex sheet and the rectangular jet,\nare studied analytically and asymptotically; it is found that the magnetic\nfield and stratification (as measured by the Froude number) are generally both\nstabilising, but weak instabilities can be found at arbitrarily large Froude\nnumber. Numerical solutions are computed for corresponding smooth velocity\nprofiles, the hyperbolic-tangent shear layer and the Bickley jet, for a uniform\nbackground field. A generalisation of the long-wave asymptotic analysis of\nDrazin & Howard (1962) is employed in order to understand the instability\ncharacteristics for both profiles. For the shear layer, the mechanism\nunderlying the primary instability is interpreted in terms of\ncounter-propagating Rossby waves, thereby allowing an explication of the\nstabilising effects of the magnetic field and stratification.\n", "  We investigate the dependence of the conductivity and the entanglement\nentropy on the space-time dimensionality $d$ in two holographic\nsuperconductors: one dual to a quantum critical point with spontaneous symmetry\nbreaking, and the other modeled by a charged scalar that condenses at a\nsufficiently low temperature in the presence of a Maxwell field. In both cases\nthe gravity background is asymptotically Anti de Sitter (AdS). In the large $d$\nlimit we obtain explicit analytical results for the conductivity at zero\ntemperature and the entanglement entropy by a $1/d$ expansion. We show that the\nentanglement entropy is always smaller in the broken phase. As dimensionality\nincreases, the entanglement entropy decreases, the coherence peak in the\nconductivity becomes narrower and the ratio between the energy gap and the\ncritical temperature decreases. These results suggest that the condensate\ninteractions become weaker in high spatial dimensions.\n", "  H1 and ZEUS have published single-differential cross sections for inclusive\nD^{*\\pm}-meson production in deep-inelastic ep scattering at HERA from their\nrespective final data sets. These cross sections are combined in the common\nvisible phase-space region of photon virtuality Q2 > 5 GeV2, electron\ninelasticity 0.02 < y < 0.7 and the D^{*\\pm} meson's transverse momentum pT\n(D^*) > 1.5 GeV and pseudorapidity |eta(D^*)| < 1.5. The combination procedure\ntakes into account all correlations, yielding significantly reduced\nexperimental uncertainties. Double-differential cross sections d2s /dQ2dy are\ncombined with earlier D^{*\\pm} data, extending the kinematic range down to Q2 >\n1.5 GeV2. Perturbative next-to-leadingorder QCD predictions are compared to the\nresults.\n", "  Combating the effects of disorder on light transport in micro- and\nnano-integrated photonic devices is of major importance from both fundamental\nand applied viewpoints. In ordinary waveguides, imperfections and disorder\ncause unwanted back-reflections, which hinder large-scale optical integration.\nTopological photonic structures, a new class of optical systems inspired by\nquantum Hall effect and topological insulators, can realize robust transport\nvia topologically-protected unidirectional edge modes. Such waveguides are\nrealized by the introduction of synthetic gauge fields for photons in a\ntwo-dimensional structure, which break time reversal symmetry and enable\none-way guiding at the edge of the medium. Here we suggest a different route\ntoward robust transport of light in lower-dimensional (1D) photonic lattices,\nin which time reversal symmetry is broken because of the {\\it non-Hermitian}\nnature of transport. While a forward propagating mode in the lattice is\namplified, the corresponding backward propagating mode is damped, thus\nresulting in an asymmetric transport that is rather insensitive to disorder or\nimperfections in the structure. Non-Hermitian transport in two lattice models\nis considered: a tight-binding lattice with an imaginary gauge field\n(Hatano-Nelson model), and a non-Hermitian driven binary lattice. In the former\ncase transport in spite of disorder is ensured by a mobility edge that arises\nbecause of a non-Hermitian delocalization transition. The possibility to\nobserve non-Hermitian delocalization induced by a synthetic 'imaginary' gauge\nfield is suggested using an engineered coupled-resonator optical waveguide\n(CROW) structure.\n", "  Correlations between the elliptic or triangular flow coefficients $v_m$\n($m$=2 or 3) and other flow harmonics $v_n$ ($n$=2 to 5) are measured using\n$\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=2.76$ TeV Pb+Pb collision data collected in 2010 by the ATLAS\nexperiment at the LHC, corresponding to an integrated lumonisity of 7\n$\\mu$b$^{-1}$. The $v_m$-$v_n$ correlations are measured in midrapidity as a\nfunction of centrality, and, for events within the same centrality interval, as\na function of event ellipticity or triangularity defined in a forward rapidity\nregion. For events within the same centrality interval, $v_3$ is found to be\nanticorrelated with $v_2$ and this anticorrelation is consistent with similar\nanticorrelations between the corresponding eccentricities $\\epsilon_2$ and\n$\\epsilon_3$. On the other hand, it is observed that $v_4$ increases strongly\nwith $v_2$, and $v_5$ increases strongly with both $v_2$ and $v_3$. The trend\nand strength of the $v_m$-$v_n$ correlations for $n$=4 and 5 are found to\ndisagree with $\\epsilon_m$-$\\epsilon_n$ correlations predicted by\ninitial-geometry models. Instead, these correlations are found to be consistent\nwith the combined effects of a linear contribution to $v_n$ and a nonlinear\nterm that is a function of $v_2^2$ or of $v_2v_3$, as predicted by hydrodynamic\nmodels. A simple two-component fit is used to separate these two contributions.\nThe extracted linear and nonlinear contributions to $v_4$ and $v_5$ are found\nto be consistent with previously measured event-plane correlations.\n", "  In this work we present some results of the treatment of polydimethylsiloxane\n(PDMS) surfaces using pulsed dielectric barrier discharge plasmas. The results\nof plasma treatment using different gases and mixtures, argon, argon plus water\nvapor, helium, helium plus water vapor, nitrogen and nitrogen plus water vapor,\nwere compared testing the adhesion between two PDMS samples for each kind of\nplasma. We also studied the water contact angle in function of plasma process\ntime of PDMS surfaces with each kind of plasma treatment. The plasma was\ncharacterized by optical emission spectroscopy (OES) to identify the emitting\nspecies and determine the plasma temperatures. The plasma temperature for each\nprocess was estimated comparing the spectrum obtained by OES with the spectrum\ngenerated by SpecAir simulation code. Measurements of power delivered to the\nplasmas were also performed. As the results, all the process using different\ngases show good adhesion efficacy between PDMS samples when long exposure time\n(larger than 150 seconds) is applied. However, when only a few discharges are\napplied to PDMS samples the helium plasma process presented best results.\nAtomic Force Microscopy (AFM) analysis of PDMS samples treated with helium\nplasma showed reduction in the surface roughness, which increase the surface\ncontact area and improves the adhesion.\n", "  Correlated fermions are of high interest in condensed matter (Fermi liquids,\nWigner molecules), cold atomic gases and dense plasmas. Here we propose a novel\napproach to path integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) simulations of strongly degenerate\nnon-ideal fermions at finite temperature by combining a fourth-order\nfactorization of the density matrix with antisymmetric propagators, i.e.,\ndeterminants, between all imaginary time slices. To efficiently run through the\nmodified configuration space, we introduce a modification of the widely used\ncontinuous space worm algorithm, which allows for an efficient sampling at\narbitrary system parameters. We demonstrate how the application of determinants\nachieves an effective blocking of permutations with opposite signs, leading to\na significant relieve of the fermion sign problem. To benchmark the capability\nof our method regarding the simulation of degenerate fermions, we consider\nmultiple electrons in a quantum dot and compare our results with other ab\ninitio techniques, where they are available. The present permutation blocking\npath integral Monte Carlo approach allows us to obtain accurate results even\nfor $N=20$ electrons at low temperature and arbitrary coupling, where no other\nab initio results have been reported, so far.\n", "  We demonstrate that a quasi-two-dimensional spin-1 condensate quenched to a\nferromagnetic phase undergoes universal coarsening in its late time dynamics.\nThe quench can be implemented by a sudden change in the applied magnetic field\nand, depending on the final value, the ferromagnetic phase has easy-axis\n(Ising) or easy-plane (XY) symmetry, with different dynamical critical\nexponents. Our results for the easy-plane phase reveal a fractal domain\nstructure and the crucial role of polar-core spin vortices in the coarsening\ndynamics.\n", "  A method to realize artificial magnetic fields for light waves trapped in\npassive optical cavities with anamorphic optical elements is theoretically\nproposed. In particular, when a homogeneous magnetic field is realized, a\nhighly-degenerate Landau level structure for the frequency spectrum of the\ntransverse resonator modes is obtained, corresponding to a cyclotron motion of\nthe optical cavity field. This can be probed by transient excitation of the\npassive optical resonator.\n", "  We demonstrate phase locking of a 729 nm diode laser to a 1542 nm master\nlaser via an erbium-doped-fiber frequency comb, using a transfer-oscillator\nfeedforward scheme which suppresses the effect of comb noise in an\nunprecedented 1.8 MHz bandwidth. We illustrate its performance by carrying out\ncoherent manipulations of a trapped calcium ion with 99 % fidelity even at\nfew-microsecond timescales. We thus demonstrate that transfer-oscillator\nlocking can provide sufficient phase stability for high-fidelity quantum logic\nmanipulation even without pre-stabilization of the slave diode laser.\n", "  A route toward lineshape engineering of Fano resonances in photonic\nstructures is theoretically proposed, which uses dynamic modulation of the\nrefractive index of a microcavity. The method is exemplified by considering\ncoupled-resonator optical waveguide systems. An exact Floquet analysis, based\non coupled-mode theory, is presented. Two distinct kinds of resonances can be\ndynamically created, depending on whether the static structure sustains a\nlocalized mode or not. In the former case a single Fano resonance arises, which\ncan be tuned in both frequency and line width by varying the refractive index\nmodulation amplitude and frequency. In the latter case two resonances, in the\nform of narrow asymmetric dips in the transmittance, are found, which can\noverlap resulting in an electromagnetically-induced transparency effect.\n", "  In the paper we discuss possible applications of the so-called stroboscopic\ntomography (stroboscopic observability) to selected decoherence models of\n2-level quantum systems. The main assumption behind our reasoning claims that\nthe time evolution of the analyzed system is given by a master equation of the\nform $\\dot{\\rho} = \\mathbb{L} \\rho$ and the macroscopic information about the\nsystem is provided by the mean values $m_i (t_j) = Tr(Q_i \\rho(t_j))$ of\ncertain observables $\\{Q_i\\}_{i=1} ^r $ measured at different time instants\n$\\{t_j\\}_{j=1}^p$. The goal of the stroboscopic tomography is to establish the\noptimal criteria for observability of a quantum system, i.e. minimal value of\n$r$ and $p$ as well as the properties of the observables $\\{Q_i\\}_{i=1} ^r $.\n", "  With future experiments proposing detectors that utilize very large-area GEM\nfoils, there is a need for commercially available GEM foils. Double-mask\netching techniques pose a clear limitation in the maximum size of GEM foils. In\ncontrast, single-mask techniques developed at CERN would allow one to overcome\nthose limitations. However with interest in GEM foils increasing and CERN being\nthe only main distributor, keeping up with the demand for GEM foils will be\ndifficult. Thus the commercialization of GEMs has been established by Tech-Etch\nof Plymouth, MA, USA using single-mask techniques.\n  We report on the electrical and geometrical properties, along with the inner\nand outer hole diameter size uniformity of 10 $\\times$ 10 cm$^2$ and\n40$\\times$40 cm$^2$ GEM foils. The Tech-Etch foils were found to have excellent\nelectrical properties. The measured mean optical properties were found to\nreflect the desired parameters and are consistent with those measured in\ndouble-mask GEM foils, and show good hole diameter uniformity over the active\narea. These foils are well suited for future applications in nuclear and\nparticle physics where tracking devices are needed.\n", "  We test the models of vacuum energy interacting with cold dark matter and try\nto probe the possible deviation from the $\\Lambda$CDM model using current\nobservations. We focus on two specific models, $Q=3\\beta H\\rho_{\\Lambda}$ and\n$Q=3\\beta H\\rho_c$. The data combinations come from the Planck 2013 data, the\nbaryon acoustic oscillations measurements, the type-Ia supernovae data, the\nHubble constant measurement, the redshift space distortions data and the galaxy\nweak lensing data. For the $Q=3\\beta H\\rho_c$ model, we find that it can be\ntightly constrained by all the data combinations, while for the $Q=3\\beta\nH\\rho_{\\Lambda}$ model, there still exist significant degeneracies between\nparameters. The tightest constraints for the coupling constant are\n$\\beta=-0.026^{+0.036}_{-0.053}$ (for $Q=3\\beta H\\rho_{\\Lambda}$) and\n$\\beta=-0.00045\\pm0.00069$ (for $Q=3\\beta H\\rho_c$) at the $1\\sigma$ level. For\nall the fit results, we find that the null interaction $\\beta=0$ is always\nconsistent with data. Our work completes the discussion on the interacting dark\nenergy model in the recent Planck 2015 papers. Considering this work together\nwith the Planck 2015 results, it is believed that there is no evidence for the\nmodels beyond the standard $\\Lambda$CDM model from the point of view of\npossible interaction.\n", "  Propagating quantum microwaves have been proposed and successfully\nimplemented to generate entanglement, thereby establishing a promising platform\nfor the realisation of a quantum communication channel. However, the\nimplementation of quantum teleportation with photons in the microwave regime is\nstill absent. At the same time, recent developments in the field show that this\nkey protocol could be feasible with current technology, which would pave the\nway to boost the field of microwave quantum communication. Here, we discuss the\nfeasibility of a possible implementation of microwave quantum teleportation in\na realistic scenario with losses. Furthermore, we propose how to implement\nquantum repeaters in the microwave regime without using photodetection, a key\nprerequisite to achieve long distance entanglement distribution.\n", "  Fast entangling gates for trapped ions offer vastly improved gate operation\ntimes relative to implemented gates, as well as approaches to trap scaling.\nGates on neighbouring ions only involve local ions when performed sufficiently\nfast, and we find that even a fast gate between distant ions with few degrees\nof freedom restores all the motional modes given more stringent gate speed\nconditions. We compare pulsed fast gate schemes, defined by a timescale faster\nthan the trap period, and find that our proposed scheme has less stringent\nrequirements on laser repetition rate for achieving arbitrary gate time targets\nand infidelities well below $10^{-4}$. By extending gate schemes to ion\ncrystals, we explore the effect of ion number on gate fidelity for coupling\nneighbouring pairs of ions in large crystals. Inter-ion distance determines the\ngate time, and a factor of five increase in repetition rate, or correspondingly\nthe laser power, reduces the infidelity by almost two orders of magnitude. We\nalso apply our fast gate scheme to entangle the first and last ions in a\ncrystal. As the number of ions in the crystal increases, significant increases\nin the laser power are required to provide the short gate times corresponding\nto fidelity above 0.99.\n", "  We report the discovery of ASASSN-15lh (SN 2015L), which we interpret as the\nmost luminous supernova yet found. At redshift z = 0.2326, ASASSN-15lh reached\nan absolute magnitude of M_{u,AB} = -23.5+/-0.1 and bolometric luminosity L_bol\n= (2.2+/-0.2)x 10^45 ergs s^-1, which is more than twice as luminous as any\npreviously known supernova. It has several major features characteristic of the\nhydrogen-poor super-luminous supernovae (SLSNe-I), whose energy sources and\nprogenitors are currently poorly understood. In contrast to most previously\nknown SLSNe-I that reside in star-forming dwarf galaxies, ASASSN-15lh appears\nto be hosted by a luminous galaxy (M_K ~ -25.5) with little star formation. In\nthe 4 months since first detection, ASASSN-15lh radiated (1.1+/- 0.2)x10^52\nergs, challenging the magnetar model for its engine.\n", "  Fluctuations of the atomic positions are at the core of a large class of\nunusual material properties ranging from quantum para-electricity to high\ntemperature superconductivity. Their measurement in solids is the subject of an\nintense scientific debate focused on seeking a methodology capable of\nestablishing a direct link between the variance of the atomic displacements and\nexperimentally measurable observables. Here we address this issue by means of\nnon-equilibrium optical experiments performed in shot-noise limited regime. The\nvariance of the time dependent atomic positions and momenta is directly mapped\ninto the quantum fluctuations of the photon number of the scattered probing\nlight. A fully quantum description of the non-linear interaction between\nphotonic and phononic fields is benchmarked by unveiling the squeezing of\nthermal phonons in $\\alpha$-quartz.\n", "  We simulate one-dimensional arrays of tunnel junctions using the kinetic\nMonte Carlo method to study charge filling behaviour in the large charging\nenergy limit. By applying a small fixed voltage bias and varying the offset\nvoltage, we investigate this behaviour in clean and disordered arrays (both\nweak and strong disorder effects). The offset voltage dependent modulation of\nthe current is highly sensitive to background charge disorder and exhibits\nsubstantial variation depending on the strength of the disorder. We show that\nwhile small fractional charge filling factors are likely to be washed out in\nexperimental devices due to strong background charge disorder, larger factors\nmay be observable.\n", "  The dielectric tensor of $\\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ was determined by generalized\nspectroscopic ellipsometry in a wide spectral range from $0.5\\,\\mathrm{eV}$ to\n$8.5\\,\\mathrm{eV}$ as well as by calculation including quasiparticle bands and\nexcitonic effects. The dielectric tensors obtained by both methods are in\nexcellent agreement with each other and the observed transitions in the\ndielectric function are assigned to the corresponding valence bands. It is\nshown that the off-diagonal element of the dielectric tensor reaches values up\nto $|\\varepsilon_{xz} | \\approx 0.30 $ and cannot be neglected. Even in the\ntransparent spectral range where it is quite small ($|\\varepsilon_{xz} | < 0.02\n$) it causes a rotation of the dielectric axes around the symmetry axis of up\nto $20^\\circ$.\n", "  Novel materials and devices in photonics have the potential to revolutionize\noptical information processing, beyond conventional binary-logic approaches.\nLaser systems offer a rich repertoire of useful dynamical behaviors, including\nthe excitable dynamics also found in the time-resolved \"spiking\" of neurons.\nSpiking reconciles the expressiveness and efficiency of analog processing with\nthe robustness and scalability of digital processing. We demonstrate that\ngraphene-coupled laser systems offer a unified low-level spike optical\nprocessing paradigm that goes well beyond previously studied laser dynamics. We\nshow that this platform can simultaneously exhibit logic-level restoration,\ncascadability and input-output isolation---fundamental challenges in optical\ninformation processing. We also implement low-level spike-processing tasks that\nare critical for higher level processing: temporal pattern detection and stable\nrecurrent memory. We study these properties in the context of a fiber laser\nsystem, but the addition of graphene leads to a number of advantages which stem\nfrom its unique properties, including high absorption and fast carrier\nrelaxation. These could lead to significant speed and efficiency improvements\nin unconventional laser processing devices, and ongoing research on graphene\nmicrofabrication promises compatibility with integrated laser platforms.\n", "  Unidirectional and robust transport is generally observed at the edge of two-\nor three-dimensional quantum Hall and topological insulator systems. A hallmark\nof these systems is topological protection, i.e. the existence of propagative\nedge states that cannot be scattered by imperfections or disorder in the\nsystem. A different and less explored form of robust transport arises in\nnon-Hermitian systems in the presence of an {\\it imaginary} gauge field. As\ncompared to topologically-protected transport in quantum Hall and topological\ninsulator systems, robust non-Hermitian transport can be observed in {\\it\nlower} dimensional (i.e. one dimensional) systems. In this work the transport\nproperties of one-dimensional tight-binding lattices with an imaginary gauge\nfield are theoretically investigated, and the physical mechanism underlying\nrobust one-way transport is highlighted. Back scattering is here forbidden\nbecause reflected waves are evanescent rather than propagative. Remarkably, the\nspectral transmission of the non-Hermitian lattice is shown to be mapped into\nthe one of the corresponding Hermitian lattice, i.e. without the gauge field,\n{\\it but} computed in the complex plane. In particular, at large values of the\ngauge field the spectral transmittance becomes equal to one, even in the\npresence of disorder or lattice imperfections. This phenomenon can be referred\nto as {\\it one-way non-Hermitian transparency}. Robust one-way transport can be\nalso realized in a more realistic setting, namely in heterostructure systems,\nin which a non-Hermitian disordered lattice is embedded between two homogeneous\nHermitian lattices. Such a double heterostructure realizes asymmetric\n(non-reciprocal) wave transmission. A physical implementation of non-Hermtian\ntransparency, based on light transport in a chain of optical microring\nresonators, is suggested.\n", "  The effective potential $\\Phi$ of a classical ion in a weakly correlated\nquantum plasma in thermodynamic equilibrium at finite temperature is well\ndescribed by the RPA screened Coulomb potential. Additionally, collision\neffects can be included via a relaxation time ansatz (Mermin dielectric\nfunction). These potentials are used to study the quality of various statically\nscreened potentials that were recently proposed by Shukla and Eliasson (SE)\n[Phys. Rev. Lett. {\\bf 108}, 165007 (2012)], Akbari--Moghanjoughi (AM) [Phys.\nPlasmas {\\bf 22}, 022103 (2015)] and Stanton and Murillo (SM) [Phys. Rev. E\n{\\bf 91}, 033104 (2015)] starting from quantum hydrodynamic theory (QHD). Our\nanalysis reveals that the SE potential is qualitatively different from the full\npotential, whereas the SM potential (at any temperature) and the AM potential\n(at zero temperature) are significantly more accurate. This confirms the\ncorrectness of the recently derived [Michta {\\em et al.}, Contrib. Plasma Phys.\n{\\bf 55}, (2015)] pre-factor $1/9$ in front of the Bohm term of QHD for\nfermions.\n", "  We discuss simple models which predict the existence of significant gamma-ray\nfluxes from dark matter annihilation. In this context the dark matter candidate\nis a Majorana fermion with velocity-suppressed tree-level annihilation into\nStandard Model fermions but unsuppressed annihilation into photons. These gamma\nlines can easily be distinguished from the continuum and provide a possibility\nto test these models.\n", "  Quantum transport of strongly correlated fermions is of central interest in\ncondensed matter physics. Here, we present first-principle nonequilibrium Green\nfunctions results using $T$-matrix selfenergies for finite Hubbard clusters of\ndimension $1,2,3$. We compute the expansion dynamics following a potential\nquench and predict its dependence on the interaction strength and particle\nnumber. We discover a universal scaling, allowing an extrapolation to\ninfinite-size systems, which shows excellent agreement with recent cold atom\ndiffusion experiments [Schneider et al., Nat. Phys. 8, 213 (2012)].\n", "  The uniform electron gas (UEG) at finite temperature is of high current\ninterest due to its key relevance for many applications including dense plasmas\nand laser excited solids. In particular, density functional theory heavily\nrelies on accurate thermodynamic data for the UEG. Until recently, the only\nexisting first-principle results had been obtained for $N=33$ electrons with\nrestricted path integral Monte Carlo (RPIMC), for low to moderate density,\n  $r_s = \\overline{r}/a_B \\gtrsim 1$. This data has been complemented by\nConfiguration path integral Monte Carlo (CPIMC) simulations for $r_s \\leq 1$\nthat substantially deviate from RPIMC towards smaller $r_s$ and low\ntemperature. In this work, we present results from an independent third\nmethod---the recently developed permutation blocking path integral Monte Carlo\n(PB-PIMC) approach [T. Dornheim \\textit{et al.}, NJP \\textbf{17}, 073017\n(2015)] which we extend to the UEG. Interestingly, PB-PIMC allows us to perform\nsimulations over the entire density range down to half the Fermi temperature\n($\\theta=k_BT/E_F=0.5$) and, therefore, to compare our results to both\naforementioned methods. While we find excellent agreement with CPIMC, where\nresults are available, we observe deviations from RPIMC that are beyond the\nstatistical errors and increase with density.\n", "  Hydrogen sulfides have recently received a great deal of interest due to the\nrecord high superconducting temperatures of up to 203 K observed on strong\ncompression of dihydrogen sulfide (H2S). A joint theoretical and experimental\nstudy is presented in which decomposition products and structures of compressed\nH2S are characterized, and their superconducting properties are calculated. In\naddition to the experimentally known H2S and H3S phases, our first-principles\nstructure searches have identified several energetically competitive\nstoichiometries that have not been reported previously; H2S3, H3S2, and H4S3.\nIn particular, H4S3 is predicted to be thermodynamically stable within a large\npressure range of 25-113 GPa. High-pressure room-temperature X-ray diffraction\nmeasurements confirm the presence of H3S and H4S3 through decomposition of H2S\nthat emerge at 27 GPa and coexist with residual H2S, at least up to the highest\npressure studied in our experiments of 140 GPa. Electron-phonon coupling\ncalculations show that H4S3 has a small Tc of below 2 K, and that H2S is mainly\nresponsible for the observed superconductivity of samples prepared at low\ntemperature (<100K).\n", "  We consider the Standard Model with right-handed neutrinos to explain the\nmasses of active neutrinos by the seesaw mechanism. Since active neutrinos as\nwell as heavy neutral leptons are Majorana fermions in this case, the lepton\nnumber violating process can be induced. We discuss the inverse neutrinoless\ndouble beta decay $e^- e^- \\to W^- W^-$ in the framework of the seesaw\nmechanism and its detectability at future colliders. It is shown that the cross\nsection can be 17 fb for $\\sqrt{s}=3$ TeV even with the stringent constraint\nfrom the neutrinoless double beta decays if three (or more) right-handed\nneutrinos exist. In such a case, the future $e^- e^-$ colliders can test lepton\nnumber violation mediated by a right-handed neutrino lighter than about 10 TeV.\n", "  We study a previously largely unexplored branch of homogeneous and isotropic\nbackground solutions in ghost-free massive bigravity with consistent double\nmatter coupling. For a certain family of parameters we find `self-inflated'\nFLRW cosmologies, i.e. solutions with an accelerated early-time period during\nthe radiation-dominated era. In addition, these solutions also display an\naccelerated late-time period closely mimicking GR with a cosmological constant.\nInterestingly, within this family, the particular case of $\\beta_1=\\beta_3=0$\ngives bouncing cosmologies, where there is an infinite contracting past, a\nnon-zero minimum value of the scale factor at the bounce, and an infinite\nexpanding future.\n", "  Mathematics is probably the only subject that can be classified both as art\nas well as science - former, because it is not constrained by the real world\nand latter because it is a logical system with precisely defined rules as well\nas primitives that lead to unambiguous nontrivial theorems. Indian (and of\nIndian origin) mathematicians have continued to do seminal work till present\ntimes, culminating in Manjul Bhargava receiving the Fields Medal last year. In\nsuch fabulous times, a non-mathematician ponders about the nature of\nmathematics, and revisits the question: why are fundamental laws of Nature\ninherently mathematical?\n", "  Dynamical localization, i.e. the absence of secular spreading of a quantum or\nclassical wave packet, is usually associated to Hamiltonians with purely point\nspectrum, i.e. with a normalizable and complete set of eigenstates, which show\nquasi-periodic dynamics (recurrence). Here we show rather counter-intuitively\nthat dynamical localization can be observed in Hamiltonians with absolutely\ncontinuous spectrum, where recurrence effects are forbidden. An optical\nrealization of such an Hamiltonian is proposed based on beam propagation in a\nself-imaging optical resonator with a phase grating. Localization without\nrecurrence in this system is explained in terms of pseudo-Bloch optical\noscillations.\n", "  We investigate the valley depolarization dynamics and valley Hall effect of\nexciton due to the electron-hole exchange interaction in mono- and bilayer\nMoS$_2$ by solving the kinetic spin Bloch equations. The effect of the exciton\nenergy spectra by the electron-hole exchange interaction is explicitly\nconsidered. For the valley depolarization dynamics, in the monolayer MoS$_2$,\nit is found that in the strong scattering regime, the conventional motional\nnarrowing picture is no longer valid, and a novel valley depolarization channel\nis opened. For the valley Hall effect of exciton, in both the mono- and bilayer\nMoS$_2$, with the exciton equally pumped in the K and K' valleys, the system\ncan evolve into the equilibrium state where the valley polarization is parallel\nto the effective magnetic field due to the exchange interaction. With the drift\nof this equilibrium state by applied uniaxial strain, the exchange interaction\ncan induce the {\\it momentum-dependent} valley/photoluminesence polarization,\nwhich leads to the valley/photoluminesence Hall current. Specifically, the\ndisorder strength dependence of the valley Hall conductivity is revealed. In\nthe strong scattering regime, the valley Hall conductivity decreases with the\nincrease of the disorder strength; whereas in the weak scattering regime, it\nsaturates to a constant, which can be much larger than the one in Fermi system\ndue to the absence of the Pauli blocking.\n", "  We present an optical metrology system for characterization of topography of\nmicro/nano-structures on a surface or embedded in a semi-transparent material.\nBased on the principles of scatterometry, where the intensity of scattered\nlight is used as a 'fingerprint' to reconstruct a surface, this new imaging\nscatterometer can easily find areas of interest on the cm scale and measure\nmultiple segments simultaneously. The imaging scatterometer measures structural\nfeatures, such as height, width, and sidewall angle of a grating locally on few\num2 areas with nm resolution. We demonstrate two imaging scatterometers, one\nbuilt into an optical microscope and one in a split configuration. The two\nscatterometers are targeted characterization of mm2 and cm2 areas,\nrespectively, and both setups are validated using nano-textured samples.\n", "  We use weak gravitational lensing to measure mean mass profiles around\nLocally Brightest Galaxies (LBGs). These are selected from the SDSS/DR7\nspectroscopic and photometric catalogues to be brighter than any neighbour\nprojected within 1.0 Mpc and differing in redshift by $<1000$ km/s. Most ($>\n83\\%$) are expected to be the central galaxies of their dark matter halos.\nPrevious stacking analyses have used this LBG sample to measure mean\nSunyaev-Zeldovich flux and mean X-ray luminosity as a function of LBG stellar\nmass. In both cases, a simulation of the formation of the galaxy population was\nused to estimate effective halo mass for LBGs of given stellar mass, allowing\nthe derivation of scaling relations between the gas properties of halos and\ntheir mass. By comparing results from a variety of simulations to our lensing\ndata, we show that this procedure has significant model dependence reflecting:\n(i) the failure of any given simulation to reproduce observed galaxy abundances\nexactly; (ii) a dependence on the cosmology underlying the simulation; and\n(iii) a dependence on the details of how galaxies populate halos. We use our\nlensing results to recalibrate the scaling relations, eliminating most of this\nmodel dependence and explicitly accounting both for residual modelling\nuncertainties and for observational uncertainties in the lensing results. The\nresulting scaling relations link the mean gas properties of dark halos to their\nmass over an unprecedentedly wide range, $10^{12.5}<M_{500}/\n\\mathrm{M_\\odot}<10^{14.5}$, and should fairly and robustly represent the full\nhalo population.\n", "  Differential cross sections for the production of at least four jets have\nbeen measured in proton-proton collisions at $\\sqrt{s} = 8$ TeV at the Large\nHadron Collider using the ATLAS detector. Events are selected if the four\nanti-$k_{t}$ R=0.4 jets with the largest transverse momentum ($p_{T}$) within\nthe rapidity range $|y|<2.8$ are well separated ($dR^{\\rm min}_{4j}>0.65$), all\nhave $p_{T}>64$ GeV, and include at least one jet with $p_{T} >100$ GeV. The\ndataset corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 20.3 $fb^{-1}$. The cross\nsections, corrected for detector effects, are compared to leading-order and\nnext-to-leading-order calculations as a function of the jet momenta, invariant\nmasses, minimum and maximum opening angles and other kinematic variables.\n", "  Fast characterization of 2-dimensional gratings is demonstrated using a\nFourier lens optical system and a differential optimization algorithm. It is\nshown that both the grating specific parameters such as the basis vectors and\nthe angle between them and the alignment of the sample, such as the rotation of\nthe sample around the x-, y-, and z-axis, can be deduced from a single\nmeasurement. More specifically, the lattice vectors and the angle between them\nhave been measured, while the corrections of the alignment parameters are used\nto improve the quality of the measurement, and hence reduce the measurement\nuncertainty. Alignment free characterization is demonstrated on both a 2D\nhexagonal grating with a period of 700 nm and a checkerboard grating with a\npitch of 3000 nm. The method can also be used for both automatic alignment and\nin-line characterization of gratings.\n", "  Basic principles of the Hamilton approach developed for the metric General\nRelativity (Einstein`s GR) are discussed. In particular, we derive the\nHamiltonian of the metric GR in the explicit form. This Hamiltonian is a\nquadratic function of the momenta $\\pi^{mn}$ conjugate to the spatial\ncomponents $g_{mn}$ of the metric tensor $g_{\\alpha\\beta}$. The Hamilton\napproach is used to analyze some problems of metric GR, including the internal\nstructure of propagating gravitational waves and quantization of the metric GR.\nWe also derive the Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation for the free Gravitational field\nand show that actual gravitational field cannot propagate as pure harmonic\noscillations, or harmonic gravitational waves. A number of inequalities useful\nin applications to the metric GR are derived.\n", "  Bloch oscillations (BOs), i.e. the oscillatory motion of a quantum particle\nin a periodic potential, are one of the most striking effects of coherent\nquantum transport in the matter. In the semiclassical picture, it is well known\nthat BOs can be explained owing to the periodic band structure of the crystal\nand the so-called 'acceleration' theorem: since in the momentum space the\nparticle wave packet drifts with a constant speed without being distorted, in\nreal space the probability distribution of the particle undergoes a periodic\nmotion following a trajectory which exactly reproduces the shape of the lattice\nband. In non-Hermitian lattices with a complex (i.e. not real) energy band,\nextension of the semiclassical model is not intuitive. Here we show that the\nacceleration theorem holds for non-Hermitian lattices with a complex energy\nband only {\\it on average}, and that the periodic wave packet motion of the\nparticle in the real space is described by a trajectory in {\\it complex} plane,\ni.e. it generally corresponds to reshaping and breathing of the wave packet in\naddition to a transverse oscillatory motion. The concept of BOs involving\ncomplex trajectories is exemplified by considering two examples of\nnon-Hermitian lattices with a complex band dispersion relation, including the\nHatano-Nelson tight-binding Hamiltonian describing the hopping motion of a\nquantum particle on a linear lattice with an imaginary vector potential and a\ntight-binding lattice with imaginary hopping rates.\n", "  Astrophysical ionizing radiation events such as supernovae, gamma-ray bursts,\nand solar proton events have been recognized as a potential threat to life on\nEarth, primarily through depletion of stratospheric ozone and subsequent\nincrease in solar UV radiation at Earth's surface and in the upper levels of\nthe ocean. Other work has also considered the potential impact of nitric acid\nrainout, concluding that no significant threat is likely. Not yet studied\nto-date is the potential impact of ozone produced in the lower atmosphere\nfollowing an ionizing radiation event. Ozone is a known irritant to organisms\non land and in water and therefore may be a significant additional hazard.\nUsing previously completed atmospheric chemistry modeling we have examined the\namount of ozone produced in the lower atmosphere for the case of a gamma-ray\nburst and find that the values are too small to pose a significant additional\nthreat to the biosphere. These results may be extended to other ionizing\nradiation events, including supernovae and extreme solar proton events.\n", "  We present a comprehensive $1/S$ study of the field-induced dynamical\nproperties of the nearest-neighbor $XXZ$ antiferromagnet on a honeycomb lattice\nusing the formalism of the nonlinear spin-wave theory developed for this model.\nThe external magnetic field controls spin frustration in the system and induces\nnon-collinearity of the spin structure, which is essential for the two-magnon\ndecay processes. Our results include an intriguing field-evolution of the\nregions of the Brillouin zone wherein decays of spin excitations are prominent,\na detailed classification of the decay channels involving magnons from both\nexcitation branches, and a thorough analysis of the singularities in the magnon\nspectra due to coupling to the two magnon continuum, all of which are\nillustrated for several field and anisotropy values. We highlight a number of\nfeatures related to either the non-Bravais nature of the lattice, or the\nexistence of the Dirac-like points in the spectrum. In addition, the asymptotic\nbehavior of the decay rates near high-symmetry points is analyzed in detail.\nThe inelastic neutron-scattering spin-spin structure factor is obtained in the\nleading $1/S$ order and is shown to exhibit qualitatively distinct fingerprints\nof the decay-induced magnon dynamics such as quasiparticle peaks broadened by\ndecays and strong spectral weight redistribution.\n", "  The phenomenon of half-spectral unidirectional invisibility is introduced for\none-dimensional periodic optical structures with tailored real and imaginary\nrefractive index distributions in a non-$\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric configuration.\nThe effect refers to the property that the optical medium appears to be\ninvisible, both in reflection and transmission, below the Bragg frequency when\nprobed from one side, and above the Bragg frequency when probed from the\nopposite side. Half-spectral invisibility is obtained by a combination of\nin-phase index and gain gratings whose spatial amplitudes are related each\nother by a Hilbert transform.\n", "  We report the effect of hydrostatic pressure on the magnetotransport\nproperties of the Weyl semimetal NbAs. Subtle changes can be seen in the\n$\\rho_{xx}(T)$ profiles with pressure up to 2.31 GPa. The Fermi surfaces\nundergo an anisotropic evolution under pressure: the extremal areas slightly\nincrease in the $\\mathbf{k_x}$-$\\mathbf{k_y}$ plane, but decrease in the\n$\\mathbf{k_z}$-$\\mathbf{k_y}$($\\mathbf{k_x}$) plane. The topological features\nof the two pockets observed at atmospheric pressure, however, remain unchanged\nat 2.31 GPa. No superconductivity can be seen down to 0.3 K for all the\npressures measured. By fitting the temperature dependence of specific heat to\nthe Debye model, we obtain a small Sommerfeld coefficient $\\gamma_0=$ 0.09(1)\nmJ/(mol$\\cdot$K$^2$) and a large Debye temperature, $\\Theta_D=$ 450(9) K,\nconfirming a \"hard\" crystalline lattice that is stable under pressure. We also\nstudied the Kadowaki-Woods ratio of this low-carrier-density massless system,\n$R_{KW}=$ 3.2$\\times 10^4$ $\\mu\\Omega$ cm mol$^2$ K$^2$ J$^{-2}$. After\naccounting for the small carrier density in NbAs, this $R_{KW}$ indicates a\nsuppressed transport scattering rate relative to other metals.\n", "  A qubit can relax by fluorescence, which prompts the release of a photon into\nits electromagnetic environment. By counting the emitted photons, discrete\nquantum jumps of the qubit state can be observed. The succession of states\noccupied by the qubit in a single experiment, its quantum trajectory, depends\nin fact on the kind of detector. How are the quantum trajectories modified if\none measures continuously the amplitude of the fluorescence field instead?\nUsing a superconducting parametric amplifier, we have performed heterodyne\ndetection of the fluorescence of a superconducting qubit. For each realization\nof the measurement record, we can reconstruct a different quantum trajectory\nfor the qubit. The observed evolution obeys quantum state diffusion, which is\ncharacteristic of quantum measurements subject to zero point fluctuations.\nIndependent projective measurements of the qubit at various times provide a\nquantitative validation of the reconstructed trajectories. By exploring the\nstatistics of quantum trajectories, we demonstrate that the qubit states span a\ndeterministic surface in the Bloch sphere at each time in the evolution.\nAdditionally, we show that when monitoring fluorescence, coherent\nsuperpositions are generated during the decay from excited to ground state.\nCounterintuitively, measuring light emitted during relaxation can give rise to\ntrajectories with increased excitation probability.\n", "  Cassini states correspond to the equilibria of the spin axis of a body when\nits orbit is perturbed. They were initially described for planetary satellites,\nbut the spin axes of black hole binaries also present this kind of equilibria.\nIn previous works, Cassini states were reported as spin-orbit resonances, but\nactually the spin of black hole binaries is in circulation and there is no\nresonant motion. Here we provide a general description of the spin dynamics of\nblack hole binary systems based on a Hamiltonian formalism. In absence of\ndissipation the problem is integrable and it is easy to identify all possible\ntrajectories for the spin for a given value of the total angular momentum. As\nthe system collapses due to radiation reaction, the Cassini states are shifted\nto different positions, which modifies the dynamics around them. This is why\nthe final spin distribution may differ from the initial one. Our method\nprovides a simple way of predicting the distribution of the spin of black hole\nbinaries at the end of the inspiral phase.\n", "  Given a Schr\\\"odinger differential expression on an exterior Lipschitz domain\nwe prove strict inequalities between the eigenvalues of the corresponding\nselfadjoint operators subject to Dirichlet and Neumann or Dirichlet and mixed\nboundary conditions, respectively. Moreover, we prove a strict inequality\nbetween the eigenvalues of two different elliptic differential operators on the\nsame domain with Dirichlet boundary conditions.\n", "  In this paper, we explore magnetized liner inertial fusion (MagLIF) [S. A.\nSlutz et al., Phys. Plasmas 17, 056303 (2010)] using a semi-analytic model [R.\nD. McBride and S. A. Slutz, Phys. Plasmas 22, 052708 (2015)]. Specifically, we\npresent simulation results from this model that: (a) illustrate the parameter\nspace, energetics, and overall system efficiencies of MagLIF; (b) demonstrate\nthe dependence of radiative loss rates on the radial fraction of the fuel that\nis preheated; (c) explore some of the recent experimental results of the MagLIF\nprogram at Sandia National Laboratories [M. R. Gomez et al., Phys. Rev. Lett.\n113, 155003 (2014)]; (d) highlight the experimental challenges presently facing\nthe MagLIF program; and (e) demonstrate how increases to the preheat energy,\nfuel density, axial magnetic field, and drive current could affect future\nMagLIF performance.\n", "  We considered modification of the defect density of states in CdTe as\ninfluenced by a buffer layer in ZnO(ZnS, SnSe)/CdS/CdTe solar cells. Compared\nto the solar cells employing ZnO buffer layers, implementation of ZnSe and ZnS\nresulted in the lower net ionized acceptor concentration and the energy shift\nof the dominant deep trap levels to the midgap of CdTe. The results clearly\nindicated that the same defect was responsible for the inefficient doping and\nthe formation of recombination centers in CdTe. This observation can be\nexplained taking into account the effect of strain on the electronic properties\nof the grain boundary interface states in polycrystalline CdTe. In the\nconditions of strain, interaction of chlorine with the grain boundary point\ndefects can be altered.\n", "  Many experiments are currently using or proposing to use large area GEM foils\nin their detectors, which is creating a need for commercially available GEM\nfoils. Currently CERN is the only main distributor of GEM foils, however with\nthe growing interest in GEM technology keeping up with the increasing demand\nfor GEM foils will be difficult. Thus the commercialization of GEM foils has\nbeen established by Tech-Etch Inc. of Plymouth, MA, USA using the single-mask\ntechnique, which is capable of producing GEM foils over a meter long.\n  To date Tech-Etch has successfully manufactured 10 $\\times$ 10 cm$^2$ and 40\n$\\times$ 40 cm$^2$ GEM foils. We will report on the electrical and geometrical\nproperties, along with the inner and outer hole diameter size uniformity of\nthese foils. Furthermore, Tech-Etch has now begun producing even larger GEM\nfoils of 50 $\\times$ 50 cm$^2$, and are currently looking into how to\naccommodate GEM foils on the order of one meter long.\n  The Tech-Etch foils were found to have excellent electrical properties. The\nmeasured mean optical properties were found to reflect the desired parameters\nand are consistent with those measured in double-mask GEM foils, as well as\nsingle-mask GEM foils produced at CERN. They also show good hole diameter\nuniformity over the active area.\n", "  Data mining is a key technology in big data analytics and it can discover\nunderstandable knowledge (patterns) hidden in large data sets. Association rule\nis one of the most useful knowledge patterns, and a large number of algorithms\nhave been developed in the data mining literature to generate association rules\ncorresponding to different problems and situations. Privacy becomes a vital\nissue when data mining is used to sensitive data sets like medical records,\ncommercial data sets and national security. In this Letter, we present a\nquantum protocol for mining association rules on vertically partitioned\ndatabases. The quantum protocol can improve the privacy level preserved by\nknown classical protocols and at the same time it can exponentially reduce the\ncomputational complexity and communication cost.\n", "  Thermal conductivity (\\kappa) of a distorted spin diamond-chain system,\nCu_3(CO_3)_2(OH)_2, is studied at low temperatures down to 0.3 K and in\nmagnetic fields up to 14 T. In zero field, the \\kappa(T) curve with heat\ncurrent along the chain direction has very small magnitudes and shows a\npronounced three-peak structure. The magnetic fields along and perpendicular to\nthe chains change the \\kappa strongly in a way having good correspondence to\nthe changes of magnetic specific heat in fields. The data analysis based on the\nDebye model for phononic thermal conductivity indicates that the heat transport\nis due to phonons and the three-peak structure is caused by two resonant\nscattering processes by the magnetic excitations. In particular, the spin\nexcitations of the chain subsystem are strongly scattering phonons rather than\ntransporting heat.\n", "  Erbium dopants in crystals exhibit highly coherent optical transitions well\nsuited for solid-state optical quantum memories operating in the telecom band.\nHere we demonstrate coupling of erbium dopant ions in yttrium orthosilicate to\na photonic crystal cavity fabricated directly in the host crystal using focused\nion beam milling. The coupling leads to reduction of the photoluminescence\nlifetime and enhancement of the optical depth in microns-long devices, which\nwill enable on-chip quantum memories.\n", "  Recent studies have highlighted the sensitivity of active matter to\nboundaries and their geometries. Here we develop a general theory for the\ndynamics and statistics of active particles on curved surfaces and illustrate\nit on two examples. We first show that active particles moving on a surface\nwith no ability to probe its curvature only exhibit steady-state\ninhomogeneities in the presence of orientational order. We then consider a\nstrongly confined 3D ideal active gas and compute its steady-state density\ndistribution in a box of arbitrary convex shape.\n", "  The exchange interactions of Cr4N, Mn4N, Fe4N, Co4N, and Ni4N compounds with\nperovskite structure were calculated to obtain the Curie temperatures for these\ncompounds from Monte Carlo calculations. Contrary to naive expectation, the\nexchange interactions vary markedly among these five compounds. In Fe4N, the\nintra-sublattice interaction of the Fe 3c atoms is strongly negative, leading\nto a significant reduction of the Curie temperature. The calculated Curie\ntemperatures are 291K (Cr4N), 710K (Mn4N), 668K (Fe4N), 827K (Co4N), and 121K\n(Ni4N), in good agreement with experimental observations where available. The\nmuch lower Curie temperature of Ni4N compared to fcc Ni is explained on the\nbasis of the exchange interactions.\n", "  I review the excellent phenomenological status of a class of dynamical vacuum\nmodels in which the vacuum energy density, $\\rho_{\\Lambda}=\\rho_{\\Lambda}(H)$,\nas a function of the Hubble rate, evolves through its interaction with dark\nmatter and/or through the accompanying running of the gravitational coupling\n$G$, including the possibility of being self-conserved with a nontrivial\neffective equation of state. Some of these models have been used to incorporate\ninto a single vacuum structure the rapid stage of inflation, followed by the\nstandard radiation and cold dark matter epochs all the way down until the dark\nenergy era. Remarkably, the running vacuum models (RVM's) render an outstanding\nphenomenological description of the main cosmological data at a level that is\ncurrently challenging the concordance $\\Lambda$CDM model, thereby implying that\npresent observations seem to point to a running vacuum rather than to a rigid\ncosmological constant $\\Lambda$ in our Universe.\n", "  In a mini-review [Physica A {\\bf 392} (2013) 5261--5282] it has been shown\nthat classical traffic flow theories and models failed to explain empirical\ntraffic breakdown -- a phase transition from metastable free flow to\nsynchronized flow at highway bottlenecks. The main objective of this\nmini-review is to study the consequence of this failure of classical\ntraffic-flow theories for an analysis of empirical stochastic highway capacity\nas well as for the effect of automatic driving vehicles and cooperative driving\non traffic flow. To reach this goal, we show a deep connection between the\nunderstanding of empirical stochastic highway capacity and a reliable analysis\nof automatic driving vehicles in traffic flow. With the use of simulations in\nthe framework of three-phase traffic theory, a probabilistic analysis of the\neffect of automatic driving vehicles on a mixture traffic flow consisting of a\nrandom distribution of automatic driving and manual driving vehicles has been\nmade. We have found that the parameters of automatic driving vehicles can\neither decrease or increase the probability of traffic breakdown. The increase\nin the probability of traffic breakdown, i.e., the deterioration of the\nperformance of the traffic system can occur already at a small percentage\n(about 5$\\%$) of automatic driving vehicles. The increase in the probability of\ntraffic breakdown through automatic driving vehicles can be realized, even if\nany platoon of automatic driving vehicles satisfies condition for string\nstability.\n", "  In this paper we promote the use of Support Vector Machines (SVM) as a\nmachine learning tool for searches in high-energy physics. As an example for a\nnew- physics search we discuss the popular case of Supersymmetry at the Large\nHadron Collider. We demonstrate that the SVM is a valuable tool and show that\nan automated discovery- significance based optimization of the SVM\nhyper-parameters is a highly efficient way to prepare an SVM for such\napplications. A new C++ LIBSVM interface called SVM-HINT is developed and\navailable on Github.\n", "  Since mid 2014 Gaia mission delivers daily millions of observations of the\nwhole sky. Among them we search for transient events, e.g., supernovae,\nmicrolensing events, cataclysmic variables, etc. In my talk I describe the\nnear-real-time Gaia data processing pipeline for anomaly detection, show first\nscientific results from years 2014/2015 and describe the organization of the\nground-based network for the photometric and spectroscopic follow-up of Gaia\nalerts.\n", "  States of self stress, organizations of internal forces in many-body systems\nthat are in equilibrium with an absence of external forces, can be thought of\nas the constitutive building blocks of the elastic response of a material. In\noverconstrained disordered packings they have a natural mathematical\ncorrespondence with the zero-energy vibrational modes in underconstrained\nsystems. While substantial attention in the literature has been paid to\ndiverging length scales associated with zero- and finite-energy vibrational\nmodes in jammed systems, less is known about the spatial structure of the\nstates of self stress. In this work we define a natural way in which a unique\nstate of self stress can be associated with each bond in a disordered spring\nnetwork derived from a jammed packing, and then investigate the spatial\nstructure of these bond-localized states of self stress. This allows for an\nunderstanding of how the elastic properties of a system would change upon\nchanging the strength or even existence of any bond in the system.\n", "  Topological insulators (TIs) are a new quantum state of matter discovered\nrecently, which are characterized by unconventional bulk topological\ninvariants. Proposals for practical applications of the TIs are mostly based\nupon their metallic surface or edge states. Here, we report the theoretical\ndiscovery of a bulk quantum pumping effect in a two-dimensional TI electrically\nmodulated in adiabatic cycles. In each cycle, an amount of spin proportional to\nthe sample width can be pumped into a nonmagnetic electrode, which is\nattributed to nonzero spin Chern numbers $C_{\\pm}$. Moreover, by using a\nhalf-metallic electrode, universal quantized charge pumping conductivities\n$-C_{\\pm}e^2/h$ can be measured. This discovery paves the way for direct\ninvestigation of the robust topological properties of the TIs.\n", "  Non-destructive determination of lithium distribution in a working battery is\nkey for addressing both efficiency and safety issues. Although various\ntechniques have been developed to map the lithium distribution in electrodes,\nthese methods are mostly applicable to test cells. Here we propose the use of\nhigh-energy x-ray Compton scattering spectroscopy to measure the local lithium\nconcentration in closed electrochemical cells. A combination of experimental\nmeasurements and parallel first-principles computations is used to show that\nthe shape parameter S of the Compton profile is linearly proportional to\nlithium concentration and thus provides a viable descriptor for this important\nquantity. The merits and applicability of our method are demonstrated with\nillustrative examples of LixMn2O4 cathodes and a working commercial lithium\ncoin battery CR2032.\n", "  The interplay between the thermal transport property and the topological\naspect is investigated in a spin-triplet chiral p-wave superconductor Sr2RuO4\nwith the strong two-dimensionality. We show the thermal Hall conductivity is\nwell described by the temperature linear term and the exponential term in the\nlow temperature region. While the former term is proportional to the so-called\nChern number directly, the latter is associated with the superconducting gap\namplitude of the gamma band. We also demonstrate that the coefficient of the\nexponential term changes the sign around Lifshitz transition. Our obtained\nresult may enable us access easily the physical quantities and the topological\nproperty of Sr2RuO4 in detail.\n", "  We study the soft behavior of string scattering amplitudes at three level\nwith massless and massive external insertions, relying on different techniques\nto compute 4-points amplitudes respectively with open or closed strings.\n", "  Astronomical images and datasets are increasingly high-resolution and\nmulti-dimensional. The vast majority of astronomers perform all of their\nvisualisation and analysis tasks on low-resolution, two-dimensional desktop\nmonitors. If there were no technological barriers to designing the ultimate\nstereoscopic display for astronomy, what would it look like? What capabilities\nwould we require of our compute hardware to drive it? And are existing\ntechnologies even close to providing a true 3D experience that is compatible\nwith the depth resolution of human stereoscopic vision? We consider the CAVE2\n(an 80 Megapixel, hybrid 2D and 3D virtual reality environment directly\nintegrated with a 100 Tflop/s GPU-powered supercomputer) and the Oculus Rift (a\nlow- cost, head-mounted display) as examples at opposite financial ends of the\nimmersive display spectrum.\n", "  Adsorption sites of molecules critically determine the electric/photonic\nproperties and its stability of heterogeneous molecule-metal interfaces. Then,\nselectivity of adsorption site is essential for development of the fields\nincluding organic electronics, catalysis, and biology. However, due to current\ntechnical limitations, site-selectivity remains a major challenge because of\ndifficulty in precise selection of meaningful one among the sites. Here, we\nreport the single site-selection at a single-molecule junction by performing\nnewly developed hybrid technique: simultaneous characterization of surface\nenhanced Raman scattering (SERS) and current-voltage (I-V) measurements. The\nI-V response of 1,4-benzenedithiol junctions, reveals the existence of three\nmeta-stable states arising from different adsorption sites. Notably, correlated\nSERS measurements show selectivity towards one of the adsorption sites, bridge\nsites. This site-selectivity represents an essential step towards the reliable\nintegration of individual molecules on metallic surfaces. Furthermore, the\nhybrid spectro-electric technique reveals the dependence of the SERS intensity\non the strength of the molecule-metal interaction, showing the interdependence\nbetween the optical and electronic properties in single-molecule junctions.\n", "  Context. The most primitive metal-poor stars are important for studying the\nconditions of the early galaxy and are also relevant to big bang\nnucleosynthesis. Aims. Our objective is to find the brightest (V<14) most\nmetal-poor stars. Methods. Candidates were selected using a new method, which\nis based on the mismatch between spectral types derived from colors and\nobserved spectral types. They were observed first at low resolution with EFOSC2\nat the NTT/ESO to obtain an initial set of stellar parameters. The most\npromising candidate, 2MASS J18082002-5104378 (V=11.9), was observed at high\nresolution (R=50 000) with UVES at the VLT/ESO, and a standard abundance\nanalysis was performed. Results. We found that 2MASS J18082002-5104378 is an\nultra metal-poor star with stellar parameters Teff = 5440 K, log g = 3.0 dex,\nvt = 1.5 km/s, [Fe/H] = -4.1 dex. The star has [C/Fe]<+0.9 in a 1D analysis, or\n[C/Fe]<=+0.5 if 3D effects are considered; its abundance pattern is typical of\nnormal (non-CEMP) ultra metal-poor stars. Interestingly, the star has a binary\ncompanion. Conclusions. 2MASS J1808-5104 is the brightest (V=11.9) metal-poor\nstar of its category, and it could be studied further with even higher S/N\nspectroscopy to determine additional chemical abundances, thus providing\nimportant constraints to the early chemical evolution of our Galaxy.\n", "  A review is given for the theoretical framework to give a reliable prediction\nof the superconducting transition temperature Tc from first principles,\ntogether with a practical strategy for its application to actual materials with\nillustrations of the results of Tc calculated for superconductors in the\nweak-coupling region like the alkali and alkaline-earth intercalated graphites\nas well as those in the strong-coupling region like the alkali-doped\nfullerides.\n", "  Previously, it has been shown that the strength of the perpendicular magnetic\nanisotropy (PMA) of thin Palladium-Cobalt bi-layer films can be modified when\nhydrogen gas is absorbed by the Palladium (Pd) layer. In our recent work we\nshowed that the ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) response of this material is\nsensitive to changes in PMA upon exposure of Pd to hydrogen gas. As such, a\nsimple, compact and contactless hydrogen gas sensor could exploit FMR-based\ndetection, of the reversible hydrogen-gas-induced changes in PMA. The magnitude\nof the FMR peak shift is critical in determining the sensor's sensitivity: the\nhigher the FMR peak shift at a given hydrogen gas concentration, the higher the\nsensitivity. In the present work we demonstrate that the detection sensitivity\nis enhanced when the static magnetic field is applied perpendicular to the film\nplane. A factor of eight times improvement is observed with respect to the\nin-plane FMR configuration studied previously. An analysis based on the Kittel\nequation for FMR frequencies of a ferromagnetic film is carried out in order to\nunderstand the mechanism of sensitivity enhancement. The result is important\nfor optimizing Pd/Co bi-layered thin films for use in novel platforms for\nhydrogen gas sensing.\n", "  Aggregation and settling are crucial phenomena that involve particulate\nsystems. For particle sizes of millimetre and above, there are reasonable\naccurate predicting tools. However for smaller particle sizes, there appears to\nbe a void in knowledge. This paper presents an analytical model to predict the\nsettling rates of nano-to-micro size particulate systems. The model was\ndeveloped as a combination of modified classical equations and graphical\nmethods. A calculation sequence also is presented. By validation with available\nexperimental data for settling nano-to-micro systems, it was found that the two\nschemes show order of magnitude agreement. A significant feature of this model\nis its ability to accommodate non-spherical particles and different fractal\ndimensions.\n", "  The 120-year old so-called Painleve paradox involves the loss of determinism\nin models of planar rigid bodies in point contact with a rigid surface, subject\nto Coulomb-like dry friction. The phenomenon occurs due to coupling between\nnormal and rotational degrees-of-freedom such that the effective normal force\nbecomes attractive rather than repulsive. Despite a rich literature, the\nforward evolution problem remains unsolved other than in certain restricted\ncases in 2D with single contact points. Various practical consequences of the\ntheory are revisited, including models for robotic manipulators, and the\nstrange behaviour of chalk when pushed rather than dragged across a blackboard.\n  Reviewing recent theory, a general formulation is proposed, including a\nPoisson or energetic impact law. The general problem in 2D with a single point\nof contact is discussed and cases or inconsistency or indeterminacy enumerated.\nStrategies to resolve the paradox via contact regularisation are discussed from\na dynamical systems point of view. By passing to the infinite stiffness limit\nand allowing impact without collision, inconsistent and indeterminate cases are\nshown to be resolvable for all open sets of conditions. However, two\nunavoidable ambiguities that can be reached in finite time are discussed in\ndetail, so called dynamic jam and reverse chatter. A partial review is given of\n2D cases with two points of contact showing how a greater complexity of\ninconsistency and indeterminacy can arise. Extension to fully three-dimensional\nanalysis is briefly considered and shown to lead to further possible\nsingularities. In conclusion, the ubiquity of the \\pain paradox is highlighted\nand open problems are discussed.\n", "  On the basis of general theoretical results developed previously in [I. M.\nSokolov et al., J. Exp. Theor. Phys. 112, 246 (2011)], we analyze spontaneous\ndecay of a single atom inside cold atomic clouds under conditions when the\naveraged interatomic separation is less or comparable with the wavelength of\nquasi resonant radiation. Beyond the decay dynamics we analyze shifts of\nresonance as well as distortion of the spectral shape of the atomic transition.\n", "  In the second run of the LHC, which started in April 2015, an accurate\nunderstanding of Standard Model processes is more crucial than ever. Processes\nincluding electroweak gauge bosons serve as standard candles for SM\nmeasurements, and equally constitute important background for BSM searches. We\nhere present the NLO QCD virtual contributions to W+W- + jet in an analytic\nformat obtained through unitarity methods and show results for the full process\nusing an implementation into the Monte Carlo event generator MCFM.\nPhenomenologically, we investigate total as well as differential cross sections\nfor the LHC with 14 TeV center-of-mass energy, as well as a future 100 TeV\nproton-proton machine. In the format presented here, the one-loop virtual\ncontributions also serve as important ingredients in the calculation of W+W-\npair production at NNLO.\n", "  We characterize the flow of a viscous suspension in an inclined channel where\nthe flow is maintained in a steady state under the competing influences of\ngravity and an applied pressure drop. The basic model relies on a\ndiffusive-flux formalism. Such models are common in the literature, yet many of\nthem possess an unphysical singularity at the channel centreline where the\nshear rate vanishes. We therefore present a regularization of the basic\ndiffusive-flux model that removes this singularity. This introduces an explicit\n(physical) dependence on the particle size into the model equations. This\napproach enables us to carry out a detailed parameter study showing in\nparticular the opposing effects of the pressure drop and gravity. Conditions\nfor counter-current flow and complete flow reversal are obtained from numerical\nsolutions of the model equations. These are supplemented by an analytic lower\nbound on the ratio of the gravitational force to the applied pressure drop\nnecessary to bring about complete flow reversal.\n", "  In this paper we present inelastic X-ray scattering experiments in a diamond\nanvil cell and molecular dynamic simulations to investigate the behavior of\nphononic excitations in liquid Ar. The spectra calculated using molecular\ndynamics were found to be in a good agreement with the experimental data.\nFurthermore, we observe that, upon temperature increases, a low-frequency\ntransverse phononic gap emerges while high-frequency propagating modes become\nevanescent at the THz scale. The effect of strong localization of a\nlongitudinal phononic mode in the supercritical phase is observed for the first\ntime. The evidence for the high-frequency transverse phononic gap due to the\ntransition from an oscillatory to a ballistic dynamic regimes of motion is\npresented and supported by molecular dynamics simulations. This transition\ntakes place across the Frenkel line thermodynamic limit which demarcates\ncompressed liquid and non-compressed fluid domains on the phase diagram and is\nsupported by calculations within the Green-Kubo phenomenological formalism.\nThese results are crucial to advance the development of novel terahertz thermal\ndevices, phononic lenses, mirrors, and other THz metamaterials.\n", "  On the basis of general theoretical results developed previously in [JETP\n112, 246 (2011)], we analyze the reflection of quasiresonant light from a plane\nsurface of dense and disordered ensemble of motionless point scatters. Angle\ndistribution of the scattered light is calculated both for s and p\npolarizations of the probe radiation. The ratio between coherent and incoherent\n(diffuse) components of scattered light is calculated. We analyze the\ncontributions of scatters located at different distances from the surface and\ndetermine on this background the thickness of surface layer responsible for\nreflected beam generation. The inhomogeneity of dipole-dipole interaction near\nthe surface is discussed.We study also dependence of total reflected light\npower on the incidence angle and compare the results of the microscopic\napproach with predictions of the Fresnel reflection theory. The calculations\nare performed for different densities of scatters and different frequencies of\na probe radiation.\n", "  We report a new accelerated diffusion phenomenon that is produced by a\none-dimensional ran- dom walk in which the flight probability to one of the two\ndirections (i.e., bias) oscillates dynam- ically in periodic, quasiperiodic,\nand chaotic manners. The probability oscillation dynamics can be physically\nobserved in nanoscale photoexcitation transfer in a quantum-dot network, where\nthe existence probability of an exciton at the bottom energy level of a quantum\ndot fluctuates dif- ferently with a parameter setting. We evaluate the ensemble\naverage of the time-averaged mean square displacement (ETMSD) of the time\nseries obtained from the quantum-dot network model that generates various\noscillatory behaviors because the ETMSD exhibits characteristic changes\ndepending on the fluctuating bias; in the case of normal diffusion, the\nasymptotic behavior of the ETMSD is proportional to the time (i.e., a linear\ngrowth function), whereas it grows nonlinearly with an exponent greater than 1\nin the case of superdiffusion. We find that the diffusion can be accelerated\nsignificantly when the fluctuating bias is characterized as weak chaos owing to\nthe transient nonstationarity of its biases, in which the spectrum contains\nhigh power at low frequen- cies. By introducing a simplified model of our\nrandom walk, which exhibits superdiffusion as well as normal diffusion, we\nexplain the mechanism of the accelerated diffusion by analyzing the mean square\ndisplacement.\n", "  We propose a method to separate the inverse spin Hall effect (ISHE) from\ngalvanomagnetic effects in spin pumping experiments on metallic bilayer systems\nby measuring the dc electromotive force in two orthogonal directions.\nCalculations of dc voltages in longitudinal and Hall directions induced in\nNi81Fe19 and Ni81Fe19/Pt films at ferromagnetic resonance in a microwave cavity\npredict that contributions from ISHE and from the galvanomagnetic effects, i.e.\nthe anisotropic magnetoresistance and the anomalous Hall effect, exhibit\ndistinct signal symmetry as well as angular dependence when changing the\ndirection of the external field with respect to the film plane. According to\nmeasurements on Ni81Fe19/Pt, only that dc voltage component which includes ISHE\nis more than five times larger than purely galvanomagnetic components. This is\ncorroborated by results on La0.67Sr0.33MnO3/Pt samples, demonstrating\nuniversality of this method.\n", "  We introduce the deformed fermionic numbers, corresponding to the skein\nrelations, the main characteristics of knots and links. These fermionic numbers\nallow one to restore the skein relations. For the Alexander (Jones) skein\nrelation we introduce corresponding Alexander (Jones) fermionic q-numbers, and\nfor the HOMFLY skein relation - the HOMFLY deformed (p,q)-numbers with one\nfermionic parameter.\n", "  Many ferroelastic crystals display at sufficiently low measurement\nfrequencies a huge elastic softening below Tc which is caused by domain wall\nmotion. Materials range from perovskites to iron based superconductors and\nshape memory materials. We present a model - based on Landau-Ginzburg theory\nincluding long range elastic interaction between needle shaped ferroelastic\ndomains - to describe the observed superelastic softening. The theory predicts\nthat the domain wall contribution to the elastic susceptibility is different\nfor improper and proper ferroelastic materials. A test of the theory against\nexperimental data on SrTiO3, KMnF3, LaAlO3, La1-xNdxP5O14 and NH4HC2O4.1/2H2O\nyields excellent agreement.\n", "  In this paper, we present a method to generate homoclinic and heteroclinic\nmotions in impulsive systems. We rigorously prove the presence of such motions\nin the case that the systems are under the influence of a discrete map that\npossesses homoclinic and heteroclinic orbits. Simulations that support the\ntheoretical results are represented by means of a Duffing equation with\nimpacts.\n", "  Piezoresponse force-microscopy (PFM) has become the standard tool to\ninvestigate ferroelectrics on the micro- and nanoscale. However, reliability of\nPFM signals is often problematic and their quantification is challenging and\nthus not widely applied. Here, we present a study of the reproducibility of PFM\nsignals and of the so-called PFM background signal which has been reported in\nliterature. We find that PFM signals are generally reproducible to certain\nextents. The PFM signal difference between 180{\\deg} domains on\nperiodically-poled lithium niobate (PPLN) is taken as the reference signal in a\nlarge number of measurements, carried out in a low frequency regime (30-70\nkHz). We show that in comparison to Pt coated tips, diamond coated tips exhibit\nimproved signal stability, lower background signal and less imaging artifacts\nrelated to PFM which is reflected in the spread of measurements. This is\nattributed to the improved mechanical stability of the conductive layer. The\naverage deviation of the mean PFM signal is 38.3%, for a diamond coated tip.\nAlthough this deviation is relatively high, it is far better than values from\nliterature which showed a deviation of approx. 73.1%. Additionally, we find\nthat the average deviation of the background signal from 0 is 11.6% of the PPLN\ndomain contrast. Thus, the background signal needs to be taken into account\nwhen quantifying PFM signals and should be subtracted from PFM signals. Those\nresults are important for quantification of PFM signals, since PPLN might be\nused for this purpose when PFM signals measured on PPLN are related to its\nmacroscopic d33 coefficient. Finally, the crucial influence of sample polishing\non PFM signals is shown and we recommend to use a multistep polishing route\nwith a final step involving 200 nm sized colloidal silica particles.\n", "  Background: This study is mainly motivated by the need of understanding how\nthe diffusion behaviour of a biomolecule (or even of a larger object) is\naffected by other moving macromolecules, organelles, and so on, inside a living\ncell, whence the possibility of understanding whether or not a randomly walking\nbiomolecule is also subject to a long-range force field driving it to its\ntarget. Method: By means of the Continuous Time Random Walk (CTRW) technique\nthe topic of random walk in random environment is here considered in the case\nof a passively diffusing particle in a crowded environment made of randomly\nmoving and interacting obstacles. Results: The relevant physical quantity which\nis worked out is the diffusion cofficient of the passive tracer which is\ncomputed as a function of the average inter-obstacles distance. Coclusions: The\nresults reported here suggest that if a biomolecule, let us call it a test\nmolecule, moves towards its target in the presence of other independently\ninteracting molecules, its motion can be considerably slowed down. Hence, if\nsuch a slowing down could compromise the efficiency of the task to be performed\nby the test molecule, some accelerating factor would be required.\nIntermolecular electrodynamic forces are good candidates as accelerating\nfactors because they can act at a long distance in a medium like the cytosol\ndespite its ionic strength.\n", "  We report on the temperature dependence of the $ZrTe_5$ electronic\nproperties, studied at equilibrium and out of equilibrium, by means of time and\nangle resolved photoelectron spectroscopy. Our results unveil the dependence of\nthe electronic band structure across the Fermi energy on the sample\ntemperature. This finding is regarded as the dominant mechanism responsible for\nthe anomalous resistivity observed at T* $\\sim$ 160 K along with the change of\nthe charge carrier character from holelike to electronlike. Having addressed\nthese long-lasting questions, we prove the possibility to control, at the\nultrashort time scale, both the binding energy and the quasiparticle lifetime\nof the valence band. These experimental evidences pave the way for optically\ncontrolling the thermoelectric and magnetoelectric transport properties of\n$ZrTe_5$.\n", "  A walk on sunset boulevard can teach us about transcendental functions\nassociated to Feynman diagrams. On this guided tour we will see multiple\npolylogarithms, differential equations and elliptic curves. A highlight of the\ntour will be the generalisation of the polylogarithms to the elliptic setting\nand the all-order solution for the sunset integral in the equal mass case.\n", "  We report on the status an ab initio computation of the time-like splitting\nfunctions at next-to-next-to-leading order in QCD. Time-like splitting\nfunctions govern the collinear kinematics of inclusive hadron production in\n$e^+e^-$ annihilation and the evolution of the parton fragmentation\ndistributions. Current knowledge about them at three loops has been inferred by\nmeans of crossing symmetry from their related space-like counterparts, the\ndeep-inelastic structure functions and parton densities. In this approach\ncertain parts of the off-diagonal quark-gluon splitting function are left\nundetermined, which calls for an independent calculation from first principles.\nWe outline the method for calculating master integrals from differential\nequations which are required to attack the problem.\n", "  This paper proposes a method to calculate the wires distribution for\ngenerating required electromagnetic field. Instead of solving the distribution\nof wires directly, we formulate the problem into zero-one programming form. By\napplying the proposed algorithm to solve the zero-one programming problem, a\npractical solution can be obtained. Two practical examples are proposed to\nillustrate detailed calculation steps of the novel method. The comparison\nbetween binary particle swarm optimization searching algorithm and the\npro-posed algorithm is provided and discussed. All the design results are\nvalidated with FEM calculation results.\n", "  In this paper we review two symmetry axioms of special relativity and their\nconnections to each other together with their role in some famous predictions\nof relativity theory, such as time dilation, length contraction, and the twin\nparadox. We also discuss briefly counterparts of these symmetry axioms in\ngeneral relativity and formulate a conjecture, namely that without them the\naxioms of general relativity would capture general relativistic spacetimes only\nup to conformal equivalence.\n", "  We consider the problem of computing, for a detector waiting for a quantum\nparticle to arrive, the probability distribution of the time at which the\ndetector clicks, from the initial wave function of the particle in the\nnon-relativistic regime. Although the standard rules of quantum mechanics offer\nno operator for the time of arrival, quantum mechanics makes an unambiguous\nprediction for this distribution, defined by first solving the Schrodinger\nequation for the big quantum system formed by the particle of interest, the\ndetector, a clock, and a device that records the time when the detector clicks,\nthen making a quantum measurement of the record at a very late time, and\nfinally using the distribution of the recorded time. This leads to question\nwhether there is also a practical, simple rule for computing this distribution,\nat least approximately (i.e., for an idealized detector). We argue here in\nfavor of a rule based on a 1-particle Schrodinger equation with a certain\n(absorbing) boundary condition at the ideal detecting surface, first considered\nby Werner in 1987. We present a novel derivation of this rule and describe how\nit arises as a limit of a \"soft\" detector represented by an imaginary\npotential.\n", "  We present a detailed phenomenological analysis of the production of a\nStandard Model Higgs boson in association with up to three jets. The Higgs is\nproduced via gluon fusion, which is an irreducible background to the vector\nboson fusion mechanism. We calculate the next-to-leading order corrections in\nQCD in the limit of an infinitely heavy top quark. Numerical results are\npresented for a large variety of observables, for different selection cuts, and\nfor different choices of the jet tagging scheme.\n"]}
